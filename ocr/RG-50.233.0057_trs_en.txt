Abstract
 
      Irving Horn (born Isachar Herszenhor
n) was born in February, 1927 in Radom, Poland.  
Irving remembers signifi cant anti-Semitism as a ch
ild.  When he was seve n years ol d the Polish 
governme nt ordered the integration of schools.  
Irving and the only other Jewish boy at his new 
school were severely beaten by some  of their 
schoolma tes.  Upon the outbreak of the war, 
Irving™s father lost his job and his brother was 
accused of spying and temporarily jailed.  Irving 
attended a secret Jewish school for two 
years until Radom be came a ghetto.  Upon the 
liquidation of the Radom ghetto, 
Irving and his father volunteered to work on the Wa schnik 
estate.  Irving survived encounters with the SS, then worked in a weapons factory where he 
encountered Jacob Holz, a ruthless security guard
 whom Irving later test
ified against.  Around 
July 25, 1944, Irving ma rched to Toma szów bec a us
e the Russians were 
approaching Radom.  
From Toma szów, he took a train to Auschwitz.  
There, Irving, his father
 and his two brothers 
were chosen to do work in Vaihingen an der Enz 
near Stuttgart.  A guard
 sent Irving to work on 
the Nazi Secretary of State™s si ster-in-law™s estate for two week
s, where he received food and 
regained his strength. He was 
then sent to Camp Unterriexingen, Kochendorf, and finally to 
Dachau.  Irving was in Tyrol at the end of the 
war but was taken back to Germany and almost 
shot into a ravine.  Before the ki lling was to ta
ke place, the SS me n changed into civilian clothes 
and left.  Afterward, Irving ended up in a military
 hospital in Mittenwald due to severe hunger, 
and then spent several years in a di splaced persons camp in Stuttgart before moving to the United 
States in 1948.  
 
 
Tape 1:
 
 
Anthony: 
Go ahead.
 
 
Irving: 
We ll my na me  now is Irving Horn, but that™s
 not my original name .  I was born as 
Isachar Herszenhorn and I was born in the city 
of Radom, Poland.  Eh–you want the date of 
birth? 
 
 
Anthony:
 Sure.
 

 
Irving:
 I was born in 1927.
 
 
Anthony:
 What was the date, the month and day?
 
 
Irving:
 February, 1927.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Ok.  Can you tell me  a little bit about your fa mily life after you were born, that 
period–
 
 
Irving:
 Icome from a mi ddle-income family and my
 father was a salesman in a tanning factory 
and I would say we were doing relatively well. 
 Eh–life was comfortable except for a large 
scale anti-Semitism.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Do you reme mber some  i nstances of this anti-Semitism?
 
 
Irving:
 Yeah, when I was seven years old, because of an edict of the Polish governme nt, we 
were told that we had to start integrating a sc
hool and I was the only kid, Jewish kid, in a Polish 
public school.  The incident I reme mber most is th
at we were standing in 
the line to register  for 
school.  Now Polish schools were not exactly like
 schools are here, they 
didn™t have building by 
themselves, and I believe that the school had th
e first and second floor and on the other floors, 
there were tenants actually, and we were, the 
registration was on the second floor and we were 
on the stairway after the second floor and there wa
s another Jewish little boy who wa s thrown off 
that st airway and he either broke a leg or he got
 badly hurt, and when we reached the office, and 
the subject was discussed, the pr
incipal looked at my mothe r  a
nd said, ﬁWell, it™s a good thing it 
happened to him, he had no busine
ss being here to begin with.ﬂ So
 life was mi serable at school, 
we were always being beaten up.  I wa s always
 being beaten up, bei
ng the only Jewish kid.  
After a year I transferred to anot
her public school where there were
 three or four Jewish children 
in the class and there at least we had a chance of 
fighting.  After two years 
there, I transferred to 
a Jewish day school and the last day before
 the war I spent in a Jewish day school.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So you were there right before the war then?
 
 
Irving: 
Right before the war.  
 

 
Anthony:
 And that™s 1939?
 
 
Irving:
 1939.  I was in the sixth grade, and the last 
thing I reme mber was pa
ssing a test for junior 
high, and getting ready to get to return to 
school on September 1939.  That never happened–
 
 
Anthony:
 Right.  Did you have a
ny brothers and sisters?  
 
 
Irving:
 Yeah, I have two brothers, twins, and I have
 a–my father and mother adopted a sister, 
so I had an adopted sister.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Can you tell me a little bit about when th
e Germans invaded in September, what you 
were doing, what your family
 was doing, what happened?
 
 
Irving:
 We ll, before they invaded we were out on 
a summer vacation and we came  back, and of 
course the war started September 1
st
.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Where did you go to vacation, do you reme mber ?
 
 
Irving:
 A small town, not far away, about twelve 
miles south of Radom–and we returned–we 
returned because my–well actually, I was ther
e with my adopted sister, she was already 
ma rried, and her husband got a draft 
notice, and we knew the war was on.  
 
 
Anthony: 
This is back in Radom, right?
 
 
Irving:
 Yeah.  It was a few days before the wa
r started.  And when we returned–well, 
mobilization was fully on, and shortly afterwards, which was Friday, if I reme mber, September 
1
st
, the war started.  Eh–there were bombings.  The next day and the day after–
 
 
Anthony:
 On Saturday and Sunday?
 
 

Irving:
 Yeah.  In fact, one hit very close and th
ere was some  machine gunning.  And this town 
was occupied a week later, on Friday the 8
th,
 I  be l i e ve .  
 
 
Anthony:
 What did the Germans do once they entere
d the town, once they took control and then 
occupied the town?
 
 
Irving:
 Well, at first.  Well let me say something, 
which is, maybe I shoul
dn™t but historically 
i t ™ s  t r ue –t he r e  we r e  a  nu mbe r  
of ethnic Germans in town who were actually welcoming the 
Germans.  At the beginning what they–well let 
me give you a little in
cident on what happened 
within the first week.  My brother walked down 
the street and he saw a–
my brothers are seven 
years older than I, and he saw a young ma n, a friend of
 his, that he used to tutor in high school, a 
Pole.  And all of a sudden the Pole called over a 
German and pointed to him and said that this 
Jew said that the Russians are comi ng.  And the 
Germans arrested my brother and all of a sudden 
he found hims elf in a Gestapo baseme nt.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Just on this Pole™s recomme ndation?
 
 
Irving: 
Yes.  With three other Jews who were ther
e.  We  didn™t know they were there but we 
found out they were there.  And the Gestapo w
ouldn™t even talk to my mother.  They were 
beating him up and they were ready to execute 
him for spying.  The only person they wa nted to 
talk to was a representative of
 the Jewish population.  Now, I don™t think we had one per se, but 
we did talk to the elder of th
e Jewish community.  He went 
down, and after some  negotiations, 
they dema nded a ransom from the community.  
A pretty high ransom if I reme mber, I don™t 
reme mber the exact amount–I know
 we couldn™t pay it as a family, but the town got together 
and they paid a ransom and all the prisoners got free.
 
 
Anthony: 
They did release them?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah they released them.  And that was the fi
rst incident.  Also, we couldn™t get any help 
from anybody else as far as the Polish populatio
n was concerned.  When we saw the mother of 
that boy, she said, ﬁWell, ma ybe he deserved it.ﬂ
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.
 
 

Irving:
 Eh–I told you my father used to work
 for a tanning factor
y.  The tanning factory 
actually belonged to ethnic Germans.  And the da
y the war broke out they told him they could 
not possibly have anything to do wi
th a Jewish person, officially, anyhow.  So he was out of a 
job.  That™s how it started.  
 
 
Anthony: 
This incident with your brother started–th
at was the first week of the occupation?
 
 
Irving: 
I believe it happened on a Monday.  It wasn™t
 the first Monday, I think it was the second 
Monday after the occupation.  
 
 
Anthony:
 But shortly thereafter?
 
 
Irving: 
Shortly thereafter.  Eh–the other thing is ther
e were a number of edicts that they issued.  
You couldn™t–you weren™t allowed to have a radio.  They closed all the schools, there was no 
education allowed.  There–assemblies of persons of
 more than five people were not allowed.  
All this was punishable by death penalty or ten ye
ars, or whatever.  I don™t reme mber the exact 
punishme nt.  Eh–
 
 
Anthony: 
You said something about the ethnic Germans we lcoming the Germans into Poland.  
Were Poles doing that also?  Or was that–were 
they happy to see the Germans or wa s it just 
usually the ethnic Germans?
 
 
Irving: 
I don™t know the answer to that.  I know 
there were people with flowers who were 
welcoming them when they were ma rching into 
town.  I don™t know who they were.  I have no 
idea.  But I™d assume  they were ethnic Germans.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber before the Germans invaded, do you reme mber any–I don™t know 
the best word–do you reme mber anything–were you frightened of the Germans coming 
because you were Jewish?
 
 
Irving: 
Yes.  Of course.  By reputation we knew what they are capable of doing.  We  a bsorbed a 
number of German refugees between 1936 and 1939. 
 And in fact there wa
s a German girl who 
used to sleep in our house, she 
used to eat with us.  And she was a German refugee.  And we 
knew what was going on–we were aware what they 
were capable of doing.  But not exactly of 
killing–but of all anti-Jewish 
laws; you weren™t allowed to ow
n anything or do anything.  
 

 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber, going back to the last part of 1939, what happened in 
Radom–other than you™ve told me
 of these edicts a
nd things like that.  What things can you 
reme mber about that last part of 1939 whenthe Germans ha d already occupied the town?
 
 
Irving:
 Shortages.  Bread shortages. 
 Meat shortages.  All type of
 different shortages.  There 
were–[pause].  I was only a boy.  I was only four 
years old.  My world 
was probably different 
than the world of an adult.  
 
 
Anthony:
 Sure.  
 
 
Irving: 
My ma in preoccupation was the fact that we 
couldn™t go back to school.  That changed.  
Not immediately, but within the ne
xt three months or so.  One da
y I was walking into a store and 
the owner came  out and told me  that he wanted to
 talk to my mother.  And then the next day, we 
were in a secret school.  There were ten of us.  Maybe ten or eleven.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Was this a Jewish school?  
 
 
Irving: 
All Jews, yeah.  Mostly students from the 
day school.  It was run by a Ms. Sobol.  She 
was a teacher in that day school.  And we alwa
ys had some body on guard.  And we we re trained 
to give signals in case the Germ
ans would approach.  Of course it
 would be very dangerous if we 
were caught.  But we were going to school for 
two years, two and a ha
lf years, going through 
junior high and most of–some of
 high school, without being able
 to carry a book or paperwork 
or anythi ng of that sort because they imme
diately became suspicious.  And of course nobody 
could have known.  If a neighbor had known or a Po
le would have seen us or detected us they 
imme diately would have pointed it out.
  That was quite an enterprise.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Was the teacher, was she involved in sett
ing this up, or was there some one else–
 
 
Irving: 
She lived with a fa mily, I don™t know if they were
 related to her, they must have been in 
an apartment.  The apartment was right on Main St.  and they set it up.  I presume she was 
involved in it–I don™t really know.  Bu
t yeah–it was quite a group there.  
 
 

Anthony:
 That™s very interesti
ng.  In fact, it™s a st
ory that I haven™t heard about.  I mean I knew 
that people would set up schools in
 ghettos and things like that, but 
this isn™t a ghett
o, and this is 
very dangerous.  
 
 
Irving: 
This is not a ghetto, no.  In f
act, as it went along, it got more
 and more difficult to get to 
the place because it was right on Main St. and fo
r a while, later on, we weren™t even allowed to 
walk on Main St. as Jews, so we had to go through the back door.  And we did that.  Until it 
became a ghetto, we were going to that school.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And that was almost two years you said?
 
 
Irving: 
‚Till 1941, April 1941.  I believe we started 
in 1939.  I™m sure, we started in 1939.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And so in 1941 the ghetto was set up.  
 
 
Irving: 
In 1941 the ghetto was set up.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Can you tell me a little bit about the ghetto, 
what that was like when they se t it 
up–what the restrictions were, wa
s it a closed, walled ghetto, or–
 
 
Irving: 
It was a closed ghetto and walled.  Th
e ghetto–it had–well–no it wasn™t exactly 
walled, no.  It had entrances on both sides, whic
h you could easily go through.  In fact, to go 
from one side of the non-ghetto area to the othe
r side of the non-ghetto area they had to go 
through a street, which ran right through th
e ghetto.  So no, it wasn™t walled.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did you know people who would go back and forth, who would sneak back and forth?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  I did too.  We ll, there were two ghe
ttos that they set up ac tually, there was one 
ghetto on one side of the town a
nd the other ghetto, the ma in ghetto.  Wh ere we lived before the 
war was actually where the ma in ghetto was 
set up.  We  didn™t even have to move.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Was the ma i n ghetto, was that in a suburb, 
or was that in the mi ddle of town?   
 
 

Irving: 
It was in the old town, called the old town.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And that was the ma in ghetto, does that 
mean it was larger  than the other one?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  Well, it was a histor ically, traditionally
 a Jewish area.  Yeah, it was larger than 
the other one.  The other one was not historica
lly a Jewish area and was on the other side of 
town.  But there were a number of people that
 commuted between the two because they had a 
job–
 
 
Anthony: 
Between the two ghettos?
 
 
Irving: 
Right and they had permits to go on bicycles
 between one and the other.  We ll–I can 
give you an incident, I™m 
going to deviate slightly.
 
 
Anthony: 
Sure, no, that™s fine.  
 
 
Irving: 
My father, in order to ma ke a living, he we
nt back to tanning during the war, which was 
illegal for us, but he–
 
 
Anthony: 
Why was it illegal?
 
 
Irving: 
Anything was illegal for Jews .  You were only supposed to work for the Germans.  
 
 
Anthony:
 So he was doing this on the side in order 
to make a living for himself and the fa mily?
 
 
Irving: 
Yes.  And then what he would do was stay 
home and [?] tan calf–raw
hide, and then sell 
the leather some place else, a small town–but in orde
r to transport it, he couldn™t transport it out 
of the ghetto, he some times used Polish farmers who put it on a wagon and put hay on top and 
hide it.  One day, my brother used
 to work, he had a permit to go 
from one ghetto to the other.  
One day when he was travelling through, going from 
the large ghetto to the other ghetto, he saw 
that wagon of hay with the ma n that he knew, with
 the Pole that he knew, standing on the ma rket 
on the ma in street, near the police station.  Un
fortunately, he went ove
r to find out why, and 
when the Polish police saw him, the y arrested him.  
 

 
Anthony: 
Is this the same  brother who was arrested before?  
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  And after that, of course, they started 
looking for my father.  Well first of all, he 
was in prison.  While he was in prison we then
 wanted to find out what was happening because 
we had no idea.  And what we found out was rou
tinely they would take them out, at eleven 
o™clock in the morning, something 
like that, and take him from ther
e to Gestapo headquarters for 
interrogation.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Now this is your fa ther?
 
 
Irving: 
No, my brother.  From the prison, to Gesta
po headquarters.  So that was early June, 
1941.  And we were in the ghetto already, so me  
and my othe r brother, who is his twin, looks 
like Fagan, we took our armbands off that identif
ied us as Jews and walked in front of the 
policeman right down Main St.  I mean not in front,
 in back.  They were walking in fr ont and we 
were in the back, and had a c
onversation with him.  He woul
dn™t turn around, he was talking 
right in front–and we were 
talking right through Main St
. without our armbands on.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Had you done that before?
 
 
Irving: 
No.  Never done it before.  The amazing thing is
 that they had to cr
oss the street, this 
was the ma in street, to take him to Gestapo hea
dquarters and they couldn™t cross the street for 
over 45 mi nutes because the German armi eswere ma rching east, there were hundreds of 
thousands of Germans, a nd this is early June–
 
 
Anthony: 
Right, just before the invasion.  
 
 
Irving: 
Hundreds of thousands, just walking down 
the street.  So they were standing on the 
corner and we were talking to him, and they
 couldn™t cross the stre
et.  So that™s–you were 
asking if people would go out–some peopl
e would just go out like we did.  
 
 
Anthony: 
That™s amazing.  
 
 

Irving: 
People would do that.  In the early days yes,
 but then later they us
ed to catch them and 
execute them for that or put them in prison for te
n years, which is the same  as execution.  It was 
dangerous–
 
 
Anthony: 
Did people go outside the ghetto
 to try to get food, and th
ings like that from the 
region–because you me ntioned shortages.
 
 
Irving:
 I don™t know.  You™re aski ng the wrong–I was a kid.
 
 
Anthony: 
Sure.  
 
 
Irving: 
I was thirteen years old, fourteen years old–that wasn™t really my dutyŠI don™t know.  
I did this later in the concentration 
camp, but I didn™t do it in the ghetto.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So we™re talking about June 1941, right befo
re the invasion.  Did things change in 
Radom once the invasion starte
d, could you sense a difference?
 
-
 
Irving: 
Well, yeah, the ghetto, things in the ghetto 
started getting worse and worse.  There was 
hunger.  There were different levels of life in 
the ghetto.  There was an 
affluent level, which 
lived normal–but the poor who had no food, ther
e was disease–and there was no way to get 
anything–and overcrowding.  There were three or f
our fa milies to an apartment.  And disease 
was one of the worst, there was typhus, all ki
nd of diseases–and then 
there were raids by the 
Germans.  They would come in th
e night and arrest and shoot people–
 
 
Anthony: 
Was there any particular reason 
given, or they 
just did this?
 
 
Irving: 
No.  They would have lists, 
and at various times there were
 different people they would 
arrest.  At one time they came and arrested–don
™t ask me  why, but they arrested the kosher 
butchers–they picked up the kosher butchers.  I 
had a friend who was my  age, who lived in our 
house, a young boy, and they arrested him, and they held him for a while and then they brought 
him back one night.  Right in front, we had a litt
le area, which there was no building on it, it was 
a little garden, and they brought hi
m back right to that garden ri
ght in the mi ddle of the night.  
We heard them all scream, ﬁMama, ma ma!ﬂ And 
shot him right there where his mother could 
hear him and then a while later they came and 
picked up mos t  of the kosher butchers and sent 
them to Aus chwitz.  But meanwhile, while they
 were picking them up they would shoot a 

number of them and if t hey would come  to an 
apartment and not find the right person they would 
take some body else like a brot
her or another relative–
 
 
Anthony: 
So they were looking for specific pe
ople as far as you could tell?  
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, generally.  
 
 
Anthony: 
They had like a list or something?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, they would come  to our house and pick
 people up.  But if th
ey™re not there they 
would pick others.  But if they would find, a
nd those raids usually would be in the morning, 
early in the morning.  And I know in some  of
 those raids they found some  people who were 
going to work like 5:30, 6:00 in the morning and th
ey shot them, just ‚cause they were moving 
around and wanted to come  to work.  Why, I have
 no idea.  So those raids got more and more, 
came more a nd more often–
 
 
Anthony: 
More frequent.  
 
 
Irving: 
More frequent.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did–do you reme mber when those raids we
re, do you reme mb er dates at all, 
roughly?
 
 
Irving: 
Between 1941 and 1942.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok.
 
 
Irving: 
There were a number of those.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber, were you living in your
 house in the ghetto
 since you–I know you 
me ntioned that your house was alre
ady in where the ghetto was set up.
 
 

Irving: 
Except two other fa milies moved in.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Two other families moved in–
 
 
Irving: 
And we shared, we had a three-room apartmen
t, so there were two other families moved 
in–
 
 
Anthony: 
Um–why don™t we go on, uh–and move to th
e, when you left the ghetto, when you 
and the fami ly left the ghetto.  
 
 
Irving: 
We ll, we didn™t leave the ghetto.  Some tim
e in Augus t 1942, they liquidated the ghetto, 
the second ghetto.  They came and took all the pe
ople and sent them to Treblinka, to the gas 
chambers.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Now was this the SS, or was this just
 German gua rds, or do you reme mber ?
 
 
Irving: 
That was, must be SS, helped by the Ukrainians.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So Ukrainians were ther e.  
 
 
Irving: 
Ukrainians were guards.  I really don™t kn
ow because they–that wa
s the other side of 
the ghetto.  I mean, they only left–they killed several hundred people that night.  They only left 
about a thousand ma les and I don™t know how many fe ma les, not ma ny.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Was this in the main ghetto?
 
 
Irving: 
The other ghetto.  The ______Glini
ce it™s called Glinice.  A
nd that was the beginning.  
Then there were rumors that they™re going to li
quidate the large ghetto 
any day now.  Actually, 
they did, probably about ten days later.  
And sometime–it began in August 1942.  I don™t know 
the exact date, but it was some  ti me  in August.
  It was right before the Jewish New Year.  
They–it was a Sunday morning, and they started 
installing bright lights 
so we knew some thing 
was going to happen that day–there were thes
e two ghettos and there was a group of people 
who worked in a factory.  There was a fact
ory in town that produced weapons owned by 

Austrians, and Austrian company ______________[341]
.  And there were a number of people 
who were stationed at that f
actory and one of my brothers 
was there and my mother was 
supposed to that day go to the factory, but when
 they started installi
ng the lights, everybody was 
trying–they knew that some thi
ng was going to happen that day. 
 Some how they came in that 
morning and they were looking for some  
people to go and work in a place called 
__________Washnik [ph, 347], whi c h is an estate, four or
 five miles out of town.  So me  and my 
father volunteered for that.  We  went  to work 
there.  So we walked out with that group, and 
mother was supposed to go to the weapons factor
y, from wha t  I hear by the time she was ready 
to go the Ukrainians were there and 
they wouldn™t let her go any more.  
 
 
Anthony: 
From the house?
 
 
Irving: 
From the ghetto.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, from out of the ghetto.  
 
 
Irving: 
So she got deported with everybody else in that
 ghetto.  Only about ten percent were left 
or so.  But I wasn™t there that
 night.  I was in Wa shnik–eh–we 
were on a little estate working 
for–and we didn™t know what was happening.  Of 
course, we saw all those bright lights and 
heard shooting all night.  From what I understand
 there were about 1,500 pe
ople killed that night 
and some  20,000 or so which were deported.  A fe
w days later we decided, the rema inder of us 
got sent to some thing 
called the small ghetto–
 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, they sent the rest of them to the small ghetto?
 
 
Irving: 
In the small ghetto there remain
ed about two or three street
s left from the ghetto.  And 
that was walled in.  Now–we decided to eh–w
e meaning me and another fellow about a year 
older than I am, we were standing in water most
 of the time working on that estate, we  caught a 
cold.  I didn™t feel so well so we went to–the 
ma n who ran that was a German, he was not an SS 
ma n, he was a civilian.  So we went to him and we
 told him we didn™t feel well and we™d like to 
go see a doctor, we actually want
ed to go out and see what happene d to the little ghetto.  And he 
finally relented and said he™d let us go and gave
 us a Jewish policeman who was there to escort 
us.  And he said he™ll give us a letter so we can 
go safely.  He gave us a letter and we left, on the 
way, my brother worked in a factory on th
e way, so we stopped in to see him.  
 
 
Anthony: 
This is the arma ments factory?  
 

 
Irving: 
No, no.  My other brother who 
was in the ghetto.  He survived, there was a selection, 
some  of the me n were left, and he was part of 
the rema inder.  And he 
was working in a factory 
that was on the way from us to the ghetto.  So
 we stopped and he told 
me , of course we knew 
then that my  mother is gone, most of the people 
were gone.  By that time  
we opened the letter to 
see what it said.  And what it said wa s, it was 
a letter fr om that man to 
the German police saying, 
ﬁThese two Jews are lazy.  They don™t want 
to work, and I suggest you execute them.ﬂ  Of 
course, we never delivered the letter.  We  just 
went back to the little 
ghetto and disappeared.  
Luckily, they didn™t look for us.  But that™s how I got
 back to the little ghetto.  Now this is what 
we called the little ghetto, there 
of course everybody was assigned 
a working detail.  Most people 
were working in cleaning up the rema inder of the la
rge ghetto.  There were some  other details.  I 
worked on–in a place that provided a shower and a 
steam bath for the people.  It was outside, it 
was in the old ghetto, but outside 
the little ghetto.  And things th
ere were very bad.  There were 
all kind of bad actions, constantly going on, 
every few weeks –Um–some, well let me tell you 
one personal thing that happened.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Sure, sure.  
 
 
Irving: 
Wh en I was working–which is just an example or whatever–when I was working in 
that eh–place outside the ghetto, one day, there 
was a bakery right down the street, a Polish 
bakery– 
 
 
[break]
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok, you were talking about a Polish bakery–
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  There was a Polish bakery, so we went 
out.  It was very difficult to get food.  The 
only way we got food, the Poles would come  to the wall, it was a wooden wall, a fence, and we 
would give them some  of those clothes that we
re left over and we™d trade it for food.  And I 

wanted to buy some  bre a d so I went in and th
ere was a line out.  I took my arm band off, of 

course I didn™t have much of an accent, so– an
d I was standing in line and I almost got to the 
counter to buy a piece of bread.  And there were
 working me n here, probably my age, ma ybe a 
year older–he saw me  a t  the counter and star
ted screaming, ﬁYou™re selling to Jews! You™re 
selling to Jews!ﬂ So I ran out.  And he went 
and got Germans and the Germans start looking for 
me .  And I had to hide, it™s a good thing they di
dn™t find me .  If they had found me  they would 
have executed me .  That ™s the type of relati
ons we had–You were aski
ng if we risked going 
out–it got very difficult.  There were consta
nt executions, people would–by the Germans.  A 
lot of the executions were done by the S.D., the 
Sicherheitsdienst 
[450].  They would bring 

people in, we  don™t know who, and execute them right
 near-by.  At one time 
in that little ghetto 
there was a–they announced that there will be a 
list of people who want to go to Palestine.  At 
first people didn™t want to regi
ster but then finally people re
gistered, and I and my brother 
registered for that.  And one day, and that 
was January 13, 1943, they got everybody out of the 
house and put them into a back yard and started 
calling name s.  And the name s that they were 
calling were from that list.  Ther
e wa s only one difference, they were
n™t all fr om that list.  Some 
of the name s  were changed, how and when we
 don™t know.  Our name s we re not there.  
Some body changed some of the names.  But names were
 called, they were called from that list.  
There were about 1,500 name s on that
 list, and those people were 
put in the street.  Now the 
question is, we knew one of the groups would su
rvive and the other would go away, and we just 
didn™t know which.  But it became apparent that b
ecause of the names that did appear on the list 
that the group who is on the list 
is going to be the one that surv
ives.  Eventually, I ran forward 
after they finished reading the list. 
 The elder of the ghetto was a doctor–
 
 
Anthony: 
Was that who was reading the list?
 
 
Irving: 
No.  The Germa ns.  Some –but no.  A Jewish
 man was reading th
e list, one of the 
secretaries.  But there were two Germans w
ho were checking the list because the men were 
running out.  If you didn™t show up when your na
me  was calledŠforget itŠthey read another 
one.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did the–Jewish council, or the Judenrat, 
did they take the list down, or did the 
Germans take the list?
 
 
Irving: 
Don™t know.  Well–what happened is that I 
ran out there and the 
lady who was running 
the place where I worked, her name  was Ms. Zucker, and she was an acquaintance of that doctor 

who was the elder of the ghetto.  
All of a sudden he called out for Ms.  Zucker and her fa mily.  
And I ran up and they stopped me  and they sai
d, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ and I said, ﬁI am her brother.ﬂ 
And they checked with him and he said, ﬁYeah, 
he™s her brother.ﬂ Of course he knew I™m not, 

but he did.  So he saved my life for that–so th
ey let me  go.  And that™s how I wound up with the 
column [503] that was safe.  Now the y took thos e 1,500 people, which were about half, then they 

added some  other, 50 or 100.  That
 part, that column stayed.  Th
e other people were just sent on 
the train and sent out to Treblinka.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So you were able to stay in the ghetto b
ecause you were pretending to be a brother 
of–Did your brother, did he rema in?
 
 

Irving: 
Yeah.  He rema ined because all of a sudden 
they needed another 50 people or something 
and some how they picked him.  
 
 
Anthony: 
For a work detail or some thing?  
 
 
Irving: 
No.  They just needed 50 mo re.  I don™t k
now why.  They pushed them over, and he 
some how wound up with those too. 
 At the end he found out that
 he was lucky too.  We both 
survived.   Now, there were executions.  On
e day they called all people who had degrees, 
doctors, lawyers, and put them in a truck and 
the Ukrainians took them out to a small town 
outside the city and shot them.  Bu
t that type of thing was happening–
 
 
Anthony: 
Right–
 
 
Irving: 
My father and my brother were in the fact
ory that produced the–
the weapons factory.  
So sometime I think in April.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Of 1943?
 
 
Irving: 
1943, yeah.  I, they took me  over there too.  
So I started working there too.  Now there 
was a camp that, there was a working camp.  We all 
worked in the factory, two sheds, and slept 
in a camp a little bit away fr om the factory.  And we were guarded by Ukrainians mostly.  But in 
the factory there were a number of 
ethnic Germans who were guard–eh–guard–
 
 
Anthony: 
Security people?
 
 
Irving: 
Security guards.  And they really
 had the upper hand–they used to–
 
 
Anthony: 
These were ethnic Germans? 
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  One of them especially.  His name was Holz, H-O-L-Z, Jacob Holz.  He used 
to–he executed about eighteen people.  One of
 them–he forced everybody to watch, as this 
young boy, a young ma n who I knew, he was a friend of
 mi ne, his name  was We inberg, and the 

whole camp had to watch it.  And they executed him.
  The reason they executed him is I believe, 
because he fell asleep–
 
 
Anthony: 
While he was working?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  One day they called me  over.  M y j
ob there was to sweep 
the street, sweep the 
yard.  They called me  over one 
day in the morning.  And he was there and he told me  to dig a 
grave for a freshly killed body of a young boy.  A
nd he told me  to bury it.  And I started 
burying–and he kept that gun in front of me  a
nd said, ﬁBury it, and if
 you don™t do it quickly, 
you™re going to be buried, tooﬂ He was some thing–
 
 
Anthony: 
This was the same Holz?
 
 
Irving: 
The same  Holz.  He also ki
lled a–there were some  people escaped and when they came 
they got–I  think it was so me relatives with tw
o children, and they executed–I didn™t see it.  
About eighteen people.  Now I went
 and testified against him.  
 
 
Anthony: 
You did?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, a few years ago, a couple of years a
go, not long ago in Eastern Germany.  They 
got him.  Ok, that™s the part in
 the factory.  Now some time in 1944–
 
 
Anthony: 
Now actually let me  ask you a question real
 quick about where you were working in 
this factory.  You said that you 
used to sleep at the factory–?
 
 
Irving: 
No, at the camp outside the factory.
 
 
Anthony: 
At the camp, ok.  How far  was this from the ghetto in Radom?
 
 
Irving: 
Oh, it was on the other side of town.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, so it was very, very near.  
 

 
Irving: 
Near?  What do you mean, near?  On the other side of town.
 
 
Anthony: 
But it wasn™t like twenty miles out of town?
 
 
Irving: 
No, no.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And there was a camp set up around the factory for the workers, for the prisoners 
basically I guess to be taken at night?
 Or did you all sleep in the factory?
 
 
Irving: 
Oh, we never slept in the fact
ory.  We  slept in the camp.  There were two shiftsŠin the 
morning a shift ma rched into the factory and worked
 all day and in the evening they went back to 
the camp and then another shift walked in–they 
worked in the factory and stayed in camp.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok, ok.  And another question–Holz, the guar
d, you said he wa s an ethnic German.  
Was he an ethnic German who was a Polish 
citizen or was he a German SS guard?
 
 
Irving: 
No.  He was not an SS guard.  He is an 
ethnic German.  From what I understand now, 
and I didn™t know then, he is an
 illiterate ethnic German.  N
o, he is not an SS guard.  
 
 
[Flip Tape]
 
 
Irving: 
Sometime in 1943 we–they brought in the pe
ople from the smal l ghetto and combined 
the two camps into the camp of the–fr om the 
factory, from the weapons factory, combined the 
two camps a nd shortly afterwards it became a c
oncentration camp.  Now, if you ask me for a 
date, I don™t know, it mi ght 
have been Nove mber 1943–
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok, but some time in 1943.  
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  I think it was 1943, yeah–and at that 
time the SS took over, we had a new set of 
guards.  In fact, they were trained to be
 concentration guards and all that–and we got 
concentration camp uniforms, hats and all that, 
and we were there until July 1944.  Again, the 
same  thing repeated, there were constant raids 
here and there.  They would pick a number of 

people and kill them.  Just before we left , a fe w 
months before that, they took a number of people 
who were carpenters, I don™t know why they needed
 carpenters, I think they
 wanted to erase any 
of the ma rks  that they left .  And these peopl
e disappeared, apparently
 they executed them.  
 
 
Anthony: 
In this camp you were taken to the arma ment
s factory to work, from this camp.  Can 
you tell me  a little bit about wo
rking in the arma me nts factory?
 What you did, what your job 
was–?
 
 
Irving: 
Personally?
 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.
 
 
Irving: 
I personally cleaned the yard.
 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, right, you told me  that.  Ok.  
 
 
Irving: 
Most of the other people worked on eh–aline doing–building bicycles or building 
weapons or whatever–yeah.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And that™s what your brother and fa
ther were doing at that time?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
Were both your brothers there?
 
 
Irving: 
Oh, my father was also working cleaning the yard.
 
 
Anthony: 
And both your brothers were then worki
ng in arma me nts, they were doing–on the 
assembly line?
 
 

Irving: 
Yeah.  Around July, shortly after, July 20
th
, 22
nd
, 23
rd
 of July, we started hearing noises 
which were, well, surprising noises, which we
re–at first we thought it was thunder, but it 
doesn™t really thunder.  But thos
e were the approaching Russian army.  They were actually in 
Lublin, which is only 30 to 40 miles down the ro
ad.  And we had some  Polish people who did 
some  training and at that time we asked them if
 we could stay with th em for a week or two 
because we thought the Russians would be there w
ithin a week.  They refused.  No way.  But 
around the 25
th
 or 26
th
 of July, again the dates, I cannot be
 exact–the–we were all evacuated.  
We walked out of the camp.  We
 walked down the streets of the 
city.  And if I reme mber, there 
were a lot of Polish workers who were just 
looking at us, believe 
it or not, applauding.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Do you know what for?
 
 
Irving: 
The fact that appa rently that we were leaving 
the city.  I™ll never forg
et that.  I shut out a 
lot of sounds that ha ppened during the war, but I™ll ne ver shut  out that sound.  I never will.  
 
 
Anthony: 
The applause? 
 
 
Irving: 
I™ll always reme mber that.  
There were some  people who tr
ied to run away that day.  
And they went into a local building until some 
of the Poles indicated where they are.  The 
Germans got them and they were shot.  We walked
 for several nights and several days.  On the 
second day or the third day, actua
lly, well maybe it was the second da
y of the ma rch, they asked 
that the people who were weak and they c
ouldn™t walk be put in a horse and buggy in the 
back–and then–so they shouldn™t get too weak–a
nd in the evening we used to–at night we 
slept in the fi elds.  Wherever we were they woul
d select a field, and we™d
 sleep in that field.  
And that night, before we got to the field, the 
sick people in the buggy got 
driven into the forest 
and executed by the guards.  And th
e guards for that march were al
l Lithuanians or Ukrainians.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So were there any SS?
 
 
Irving: 
There were SS.  There were the 
regular SS that were with us.
 
 
Anthony: 
But the majority–
 
 

Irving: 
But the majority–they used a lot of Lithuani
ans and well, there mi ght have been others, 
Latvians–I  don™t know.  Ok–it was a very t
ough march.  We  marched to a place called
 
Toma szów.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did they tell you where you were going?  Or not at all–
 
 
Irving: 
Just started ma rching.  We  were hoping at th
e time that the Russians would get there, 
but–
 
 
Anthony: 
Get ther e ri ght–
 
 
Irving: 
But apparently they stopped.  As we know 
now, they stopped for several months, but we 
didn™t know it then.  They kept us in this Toma sz
ów factory, in a factory that was idle at the 
time, for several days.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Could you spell the name  
of that town for me ?
 
 
Irving: 
T-O-M-A-S-C-O- W.
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok.
 
 
Irving: 
And it™s got a yetski [ph 701] on the end because of–
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.  
 
 
Irving: 
And we stayed in that factory for, I don™t know
, I think it was about eight or nine days.  
They separated the women from the me n.  The me
n stayed in the factor
y, the wome n, I believe, 
stayed in a local jail, I™m not sure.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Were they feeding you on this ma rch at all?
 
 

Irving: 
Yeah.  I think they did.  I™m not quite sure
.  I don™t reme mber anymore, it wasn™t that 
type of a thing.  We  had a shortage of water. 
 We  did not have enough water.  As I reme mber, 
one night when we stopped everybody ran to ge
t water and they started shooting and some  
people got wounded because of that.
 
 
Anthony: 
Because they went for the water?
 
 
Irving: 
Because they we nt for the wa ter.  So we ha
d water problems, but I don™t think there were 
food problems, I can™t reme mber that.  On a Satu
rday, one Sa turday, they put us in wagons and 
transported us from there to Auschwitz.  
 
 
Anthony: 
This was on a train?  Train-wagons?
 
 
Irving: 
Right.
 
 
Anthony: 
From this town?
 
 
Irving: 
From this town.  We  arrived in Auschwit
z on a Sunday morning.  I™m not going to give 
you a date because I don™t reme mber –someti me  in August 1944.  I don™t know exactly, but it 
was a Sunday morning.  While there, it was ea
rly in the morning–about–the first thing we 
know they told us to get out of the cars and line
 up for a selection.  While we were lining up for a 
selection, they said, ﬁHold on, hold 
on, it™s a mi stake, go back.ﬂ So 
we went back into the cars 
and we heard another car comi ng.  And while we we
re sitting there a train came in from a place 
called Lodz, L-O-D-Z.  I don™t know how ma ny peopl
e were on it, it was a large train, I think 
there were about 4,000 people on that
 train.  And while we were standing there they emptied that 
train, took all the people, all of them.  And what
 we saw on that train, they came  from a ghetto, 
Lodz still wa s a ghetto at the time.  And they 
were eh–there were some
 children there.  We 
didn™t see the children because we were in a 
camp already–there were no children.  It was 
supposed to be a population from ma ybe fourteen
 [ph] years old.  And eh–they took all these 
people and sent them to the gas chamber.
  All of them within a few mi nutes.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Was there a sense on your tr
ain that you were being held
 for some  work purpose or 
not?  That you–since you hadn™t been sent--?
 
 

Irving: 
We didn™t know.  We didn™t know.  We had no id
ea.  We thought, then they told us to 
line up.  We  thought, they™re going to do the same  thi
ng with us.  But they didn™t.  What they did 
is they took the people who looked young and lo
oked old, we were also told to watch out 
because they were looking for twins.  My brothers
 were twins.  My father at the time was 48 or 
49 and I of course was seventeen.  So we were 
all a problem.  What we did is they separated, 
they weren™t standing together.  
I didn™t shave, and my father 
shaved twice.  Some how we got 
though.  But they did take, I don™t know, 
ma ybe 1,000 people, ma ybe 2,000 people.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did they ask you your age?  
 
 
Irving: 
No, because it we nt through, you know, like a s
hort arm inspection in the army.  You 
know what a short arm inspection is?
 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  
 
 
Irving: 
That™s what they did.  They just picked out–you go this way, you go this way–and 
that™s it.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Can we backtrack just a little bit?  Can you 
tell me  about the train ride to Auschwitz?
 
 
Irving: 
I already told you about it.  
It™s just locked, and we were
 about 60, 70 people in a car.  
And the car was locked, and it was ov
ernight.  I mean we left in 
the afternoon and got in there at 
three in the morning.  It wasn™t 
that long a ride.  It was not th
at mo mentous a ride.  We were 
mostly in fear, so–we didn™t–I 
don™t have any recollections.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Alright.
 
 
Irving: 
We  left Auschwitz and the thing that I r
ecall is that we stopped–we left Auschwitz 
Sunday afternoon.  
 
 
Anthony: 
They put you back on the train to leave?
 
 

Irving: 
Except the women.  They kept the wome n.  The women rema ined in Auschwitz.  The 
me n were put back on the train–and essentiall
y most of the same  SS gua rds came back, and 
then some  new ones.  But not the Lithuanians.  I don™t know what happened to them.  Well, 
some  of them–not all of them ca me , some  of 
the guards we knew.  And we started off on a 
journey.  Well, the first stop wa
s in Czechoslovakia as I remember, the next morning.  It is 
interesting that when we stopped in Czechosl
ovakia, we saw–we saw a train going the other 
way, filled with French Jews.
 
 
Anthony: 
French Jews?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  And all they wanted to know was how
 far it is–how muc h longer they have to 
get to Dachau to Auschwitz.  That™s the only thin
g.  And we continued.  Essentially, we went to, 
I don™t really know wha t  path we took–
 
 
Anthony: 
Did they let you off the train at all?
 
 
Irving: 
No, only on the train.  We  we nt all the wa
y from there, I guess through Czechoslovakia 
and Austria, Bavaria and Stuttgart.  
 
 
Anthony: 
To Stuttgar t, ok–
 
 
Irving: 
And in Stuttgart I think they 
took us into a delousing and s
hower and then they reloaded 
us and took us to a camp called Vaihingen, which is 
near St uttgart, twenty miles from Stuttgart.  
It™s Vaihingen an der Enz, there™s also a suburb 
of Stuttgart called Vaihingen, it™s Vaihingen an 
der Enz, which is about twenty miles down the 
road.  Now that camp, it was brand new.  There 
was nobody there.  We  were the first inhabitants. 
 It consisted of five 
wooden buildings, ma ybe 
six wooden buildings, no walks, all mud.  The latrines that were just a hole covered with a roof 
and very few basic things availa
ble.  And the labor there was to
 build.  I don™t really know what 
we were doing.  I think we were build
ing some  kind of arma me nt factory.  
 
 
Anthony: 
But you weren™t actually build
ing arma ments, it was buildin
g some  sort of factory–
 
 
Irving: 
No, no.  A factory, it was build
ing a building.  It was a 
baustelle
, the German word for 
baustelle
, bau-stelle, that™s what we worked onŠthe 
baustelle
.  I don™t really know what we 
were building–em– we  would line up in the 
morning and each group would go out to a 

different type of work.  Now, the em–food s
ituation, although you get–a cup of coffee in the 
morning.  And there wasn™t coffee there was smok
ed chicory or some thing.  And a cup of soup 
and a slice of bread.
 
 
Anthony: 
That™s it for the day?
 
 
Irving: 
That™s it.  And, eh–it didn™t 
take very long before people st
arted dying.  And the rate of 
death was pretty high.  Of course then diseas
es came  in–lice, there was no soap, no washing 
facilities, no shower.  There was 
a shower built later, but the s
hower built outside the camp.  I 
wasn™t ther e when the shower was built, but I under
stand that  the day they put in the shower they 
evacuated.  So I don™t know about it.  But it wa
s built outside the camp so you™d have to run out 
naked to take the shower and come  back.  Ok?  Bu
t I wasn™t even there then.  So I couldn™t even 
take a shower this way.  There was no shower.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Were you working?  Wa s this buildin
g underground or was it above ground?
 
 
Irving: 
The buildings?
 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, the buildings, the factories, or whatever.
 
 
Irving: 
No.  It wasn™t a factory, it was a 
baustelle
, we were building things, we were putting 
things together.  There were Germa n 
baumeisters
, they were directing us.  We  were taking stones 
from here and putting them over here.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok, I see.  
 
 
Irving: 
We  were doing some  buildings.  We  were bu
ilding some  things.  I don™t know what they 
were doing.  I have no idea.  There wa s–there are 
things I can–there are some  things I can tell 
you about this camp, which I 
feel are interesting.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Sure.  
 
 

Irving: 
Which is–unusual.  The guards, we started lear
ning about some  of the guards.  Some  of 
them were very mean, they beat us.  They were very mean.  But some  of t hem were less me an.  
One of the less mean of the gua
rds, whose nickname  was Gabba–
 
 
Anthony: 
Gabba?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, we called him Gabba.  Now I don™t know what
 his real name  is.  I learned that if 
you went with the Gabba you usually got a better a
ssignment.  So one day I went to work for the 
Gabba.  And it turned out that that day he took us
 to a place, which was not the building, not the 
baustelle
, but some thing in the opposite 
direction.  We  went to th
e forest and then we wound up 
on an estate.  It was quite differe
nt.  First of all, there was a 
big tub of potatoes being boiled.  
And some  of the people, there we
re ma ybe thirty people.  They 
called some  of the people to go 
and get some  hay.  The rest of the people were 
near the potato pot.  
And there was nobody near 
us.  And when we saw–I mean we were hungry
! And we saw boiled potatoes standing there–I 
mean this is a big estate, it was a nice backgr
ound and a nice house–we 
turned the pot over and 
started going after the potatoes, grabbing the pota
toes and trying to eat.  And the SS of course 
started hitting us with their ri fl
es.  And then this lady came out and started screaming at the SS, 

telling them to stop it.  They can™t do this, not 
in her place–they™ll neve
r do this.  And all of a 
sudden they stopped.  They listened.  We didn™t 
know why, how, what™s happening.  Turned out 
that the place belonged to the baroness from 
_________Neurath.  She was a German noble.  Her 
brother-in-law was the Secretar
y of State in Hitler™s cabinet
.  During the war he was the 
protector of Hi mmler.  He got
 twelve years in Nuremberg.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Ok.  
 
 
Irving: 
But she said that while we worked at her,
 we are not to be touched.  She was a good 
protector.  She protected us.  And they wouldn™t. 
 After that they made an agreement.  She said, 
if you™re going to work for her, we™re going to 
get food.  We ™re going to 
help get the food from 
the trees.  Any fruit that™s on the trees is hersŠany fr
uit that falls off, we can have.  That type of 
thing.  And she was very nice.  There was one
 young ma n that she partic
ularly liked and she 
would some times invite him to do some  special things.  And she was very good to us.  She was a 

very nice lady.  And we  used to get a lot of fru
it and things improved because we had extra food.  
We could live there.  I worked on that place for 
about two weeks.  And it really helped me .  It 
really put me  on my feet.  And 
one of my brothers worked there too, he wa s on the same  duty.  
That helped us a lot.  Now her da
ughter is alive.  She was a book-burner.
 
 
Anthony: 
Oh really?
 
 

Irving: 
Yeah.  And–so–
 
 
Anthony:
 Your other brother and your fa
ther were back in the camp? 
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  They worked on other details.  We  work
ed on that detail.  Well, it turned out that 
after two weeks they decided, this
 is constantly going on, they were sending out 50 people to one 
camp, 50 pe ople to another camp.  Slowly new pe
ople were comi ng into the camp Vai hingen an 
der Enz.  Other camps, other nationalities.  At firs
t when we fi rst went in we were all fr om the 
same  town.  We were all the same .  Slowly, new 
people came in from other cities, other nations.  
And after working there for two w
eeks they took the four of us, my two brothers, my  father and 
me , and they sent us to Unterriexingen.  Eh–t
hat™s another camp, which is about seven miles 
down the road.  
 
 
Anthony: 
From Stuttgart or from Va ihingen?
 
 
Irving: 
From Vaihingen an der Enz.  About seven or
 eight miles down the road.  Now who ca me 
there.  There was really not, again, nothing 
was there.  It was a new camp.  There were 
only–well one building was fully completed.  One bu
ilding they just  started, I™m not sure they 
even started it.  But by a building I mean a–it wa
s a block.  One block that kept prisoners.  And 
again, the toilet was a slit with a 
roof on top.  In there we didn™t even have water.  There was no 
water insi de the camp.  To get the water we ha
d to go outside the camp. [break]  There was no 

water being brought.  Water had to
 be brought in.  That camp was 
[break] the heat consisted of 
potbelly stoves, except they didn™t give us 
any wood.  The last time we had been given 
underwear was some time in Augus t.  And by that time  it was Nove mber.  So our underwear was 

probably torn to pieces.  It wa
s full of lice.  We  had no shoes anymore.  The shoes were wooden 
shoes and the straps were gone.  There was no nails
 to fix them.  There was no soap.  Nothing to 
wash–there was no–there were no basics.  The 
best way to describe the camp isŠlook around.  
See what it is you can™t live wit
hout and then say to yourself, well 
we didn™t have that.  There 
was a doctor and he had probably some  basic pills.
  There was also one ro
om reserved for sick 
people.  The death rate was very high.  It wa
s an awful camp.  We worked there on building a 
landing strip for Ger man planes.  I 
believe that™s what it was.  Bu
t in the meantime I learned one 

way to supplement the food and not to die of hunger.
  Most of the people of course were dying of 
hunger.  Hunger was probably the bi
ggest cause of death–was to tr
y to get outside the camp and 
get some  food.  So I did that.  And especially 
on Thursday (?), I learned how to run away.  I 
reme mber the first time I run away
 actually I stole a __________________________[933].  I 
found myself as working in the fields and dewh
eating [ph, 938] the fields.  The grass was very 

high and we were laying deep in the grass a
nd the guards were front and behind us and I was 
falling behind the column of people.  I looked upand I was like 50 feet behind them.  And I had 

a choice of either trying to catch up with them
 and I knew if I do that
, _____[944] would see me  

and beat me  up.  I turn around and go the other wa
y.  And I decided to go the other way.  And I 
did, went the other way I starte
d turning around and running away 
and I did, I crawled away and 
successfully and first thing I did was go into a fa
rmer™s barn and find some vegetables and got 
some  of the vegetables but then I have to ma ke
 a decision.  What do I do?  I was outside of the 
camp, there was really no place to go.  I couldn™t 
go back to Poland.  I couldn™t be in Germany.  
There was nobody that I trust in Germany.  I kne w 
if they find out that I escaped they could 
probably harm my father and br
others.  So I crawled back.  
 
 
Anthony: 
You snuck back into the camp?
 
 
Irving: 
I snuck back into the labor brigade.  And br
ought home  the vegetables.  It helped us and 
we–
 
 
Anthony: 
What did you ma nage to get?  Do you reme mber ?
 
 
Irving: 
I think I got some carrots and some  garlic fr
om that first time.  Unterriexingen and I did 
this several times.  But one time, I will tell you this 
so that we can ma ke this a little shor ter.  One 
time, I went into a farm to a–the German farmer
s used to store and supply their food outside in 
the stor age sheds.  They never even closed the 
stor age sheds, they would put a branch into the 
storage shed just to keep it cl
osed.  It was easy enough to open it up.  And so I wandered to that 
far m and opened up the storage shed
 and that stor age shed wa s fu
ll of potatoes, carrots, and all 
kind of what were to me  goodies.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.  
 
 
Irving: 
And I started loading up some of that and all of
 a sudden I felt this thing in the back of 
my back.  It turned out to be a gun.  A
nd a lady™s voice says to me , __________[979], ﬁPut up 
your arms.ﬂ I put up my arms and she says turn
 around.  I turn around and she looks at me  and 
says, ﬁOh my God, you™re only a baby, you™re only 
a boy.ﬂ Now we started talking and I told her 
that I™m–I was only seventeen years old.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.  
 
 
Irving: 
I told her I™m hungry, I don™t want anything else. 
 I just want some food, that™s all.  And 
she looked at me  for a while and she said, ﬁYou k
now some thing,ﬂ she said, ﬁwe™re very short on 

potatoes,ﬂ and closed the door and left.  So I took
 some  of the stuff and went out.  Now I went 
back to that shed a couple more time s.  I know
 one time that I went back, I saw her in the 
window.  She saw me  go in.  I think she waved, 
I™m not sure.  But she didn™t say anything.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Now, this was in the second, this was 
in Unterriexingen.  What direction was 
_____[995]?
 
 
Irving: 
One day–
 
 
Anthony: 
This was a farm that was not far from t he camp?
 
 
Irving: 
Right, not far from the camp.  It wasn™t a bi
g farm, it wasn™t a farm like you mi ght have 
here, a farm with several acres, just a small far m. 
 One day, I reme mber that well, I went into that 
shed and the door opened and she came  in and she said I want you to come into the kitchen.  And 
she went in first and I followed her.  I went into
 the kitchen, I sat there and she gave me  a lot of 
food and she gave me  all kinds of cookies.  And sh
e even gave me  a drink of wine.  She wanted 
to know if I knew what day this is.  I didn™t know
, but it had to be the day before Christma s and 
in 1944.  While I was there it started snowing 
and on cloudy day [ph] and snow, it snowed very 
hard and uh she told me  that she cook for the gua
rds.  The guards told her that the only people 
that ar e in this camp are political
 prisoners who are against the Ge
rman Reich and I told her this 
isn™t true.  How can I be a politic
al prisoner, I was twelve years ol
d.  What did I have to do with 
politics?  She uh– I sat there for a while then I left but you realize 
that I walked around 
barefooted and the snow was high by that time.  It
 was very difficult for me to get back.  By the 
time I get back, it was too late 
for lunch.  I got back, it was pa
st twelve o™clock and the group 
apparently was already assemble
d and they knew that I was mi ssing.  In fact, they had sent 
guards out looking for me .  I knew I™m in trouble.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.  
 
 
Irving: 
I put stuff away that she gave me .  I tried to pr
eserve it.  I just left
 a couple of apples in 
there and I waited till they came back from work
ing.  I mi xed in them, you couldn™t see me .  But 
they imme diately knew who it was because there 
were only one or two who used to run away.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Right.
 
 

Irving: 
They beat me  up pretty well.  And they tried 
to tell–they wanted me to tell them where I 
went, what I did.  I kept telling them that I went
 to the airfield and that they gave me some 
apples.  I knew they weren™t going to do anything to the German f
liers.  Then in the evening they 
put me  at the end of the column whe n they 
ma rch back to the camp.  Now two weeks before 
then, they, there were two Poles 
but I left out that.  Meanwhile, some  Poles came in to camp–a 
couple hundred Poles.  
 
 
Anthony: 
They were just–they were not 
Jews?  They were just Poles?
 
 
Irving: 
They were just Poles.  Two of these Po
les escaped and they caught them and the 
punishme nt was that, after they caught them, they
 exposed them overnight, they were kneeling 
with their hands up, all night.  In the morning they
 were frozen.  So, when the column went in 
they ma de me  do the same  thing, kneel with my 
hands up and I was sitting there.  I didn™t know 
what they were going to do with me .  I knew 
I was going to get some punishment but I didn™t 
know what type of punishme nt.  
 
 
Anthony: 
This was already after they had beaten you?
 
 
Irving: 
After, yeah.  And uh it got to be very late
 at night.  A guy who worked for them, who 
cleaned up their SS guards™ barracks came out and 
I asked him what they were going to do and 
he said they decided to shoot me
.  I thought this mi ght be right. 
 And then finally they came out, 
two or three of them; I don™t 
reme mber how ma ny came ove r and they said, well, they said we 
decided to commute the sentence.  
 
 
Anthony: 
These were the SS guards?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, they weren™t SS.  They were guards but th
ey weren™t SS.  In fa
ct, the one that said 
that was actually a me mber of the German air 
force but he was a guard.  He said, ﬁYou know, we 
just won a great victory.ﬂ Now that had to be th
e Battle of the Bulge, yo
u know that now, I didn™t 
know that.  He said, ﬂYou know we  just have to 
win a great victory.  We
™re going to need people 
like, slaves like you because the German Reich 
is going to wa nt, is going to rule the whole 
world.  So we commuted your sentence.  Inst
ead of executing you, you™re going to get fifty 
lashes.ﬂ That™s what I got, I got
 fifty lashes.  And then they th
rowed me  into a, what do you call 
it, hydrolation [ph] (c.  053).  
 
 
Anthony: 
Solitary confinement.  
 

 
Irving: 
And actually there were two othe
r guys in that solitary confineme nt.  One Pole and one 
Jew.  The Pole was released about fifteen mi nutes
 after I got in there.  The other guy, I reme mber 
about mi dnight the Germans would sit here, organi
ze, and they broke several bones.  Well they 
heal, you can™t see it now.  I take
 x-rays down at the doctors keep
 asking me have I ever had a 
big accident.  I got lots of broken bones.  
 
 
Anthony: 
That™s when they beat you, that™s what happened.  
 
 
Irving: 
I think the fact that I was frozen helped me . 
 The pai n wasn™t so bad.  We ll that™s what 
happened that Christ ma s night, Christ ma s Eve.  Shor
tly after, because of that night I guess, I got 

pneumonia.  They kept me  in the hospital about te
n days and after I got ou
t of the hospital they 
put me right to work.  They made me, made me ca
rry a load of bricks.  I 
couldn™t carry it.  I was 
too weak, I was just out of the hospital.  So I 
dropped it.  Because of that they threw me  in 
solitary confinement again.  When they left  me out of that solitary confinement, they were 

evacuating the camp.  And all of a sudden every
body else in the second barracks (long pause) 
and I found my father there and my other two, my tw
o brothers were too sic
k.  So the sick people 
were sent back to Vaihingen an der Enz and 
all the people who were not sick enough was sent 
out to camp Kochendorf.  There were very few left
, very few.  Most, a lot of people died.  There 
were, the rate of death was like four or five a 
day.  A lot of the Poles died.  I don™t know how 
ma ny Poles survived but very few–there were
 several hundred.  Most of them died.  
 
 
When we arrived in Kochendorf, again we went
 through a procedure of trying to get washed.  

The way we were going to get clean is they kept
 us out it was winter, it 
was January, I™m sure it 
was January.  It was cold and on Sunday and we we
re being kept outside 
and inside they had a 
big tub of water, which was being warmed on one 
of the potbellied stoves.  They filled it up with 
warm water, and four or five guys would get into
 that tub and wash thems e lves.  After the first 
guy, that tub was as dark as the ground.  We  didn™t 
take a bath in eight m
onths, five months or 
some thing.  August to January, five months, four 
months.  So after that there were no towels 
either.  Then you went to that around the pot
bellied stove and waited there until you dried.  
Meanwhile, they took your clothes,
 whatever clothes you had and th
ey sent us to the steamer.  
When it came out the steame r they were all we
t and you put it on.  They send you outside then 
you waited till everybody was ready.  Which mean
s you waited outside for two or three hours.  
This procedure, I just got th
rough pneumonia, wi th this proc
edure, by the time I got to the 
barracks, I was pretty sick.  Now there we had 
a guy, the guy who was heading that barracks, his 
name  was Teddy.  He is a Pole too.  And he was pr
etty tough.  He was one of the toughest guys.  
He really beat us up pretty badly, beat up some  
guys.  People were very scared of him.  But he 
give us a lecture, he said, ﬁtomorrow you can go and see a doctor if you don™t feel good.  But if 

you have a 104, he™ll send you to the hospital.  
If you don™t have a 104, he™ll send you back here.  
I guarant ee if you get back here, 
I™ll kill you.ﬂ  And he meant it.  But I went anyhow, I felt bad, 

so I went to see a doctor.  And when, when I wa
lked in he asked me  what™s wrong with me , first 
he took my temperature and I must have had hi
gh temperature.  He took my temperature and 
asked me what™s wrong with me.  I said I ju
st had pneumoni a.  But the Ge rman word for 
pneumonia is lung infection (Lungenentzündung).  That™s
 what I told him.  And so he put me  in 
the hospital, first in a ho
spital in Kochendorf.  I was warm a nd I 
was in bed.  I was in that bed till 
about ten o™clock.  They came in and took temperat
ure again.  And then the guy came  in and told 
me  to get up and follow him.  And now I thought, 
well they™re going to take me  right back to 
Teddy and this is it.  And they took me  like half
way to the barracks and th
at™s all I know about 
Kochendorf is the hospital to Teddy and then all of
 a sudden he turned to the left and I saw a 
structure, which I™ve never seen in a camp befor e
.  There was a building,
 barracks, if you like, 
that was all fenced in, inside
 the camp.  The camp itself as fe
nced.  That other building was 
fenced in inside and we went to that buildi
ng.  The guy went as far as the fence and said 
some thing in a different language.  Some body came out, opened the fence, pushed me  in and 
that™s it and they closed the fence.  
 
 
All of a sudden I asked what this is, where am I? Th
ey told me  this is a TB hospital.  I was in a 

TB hospital.  It™s the only one
 of a kind that I know of and it 
was all fenced in and nobody could 
get to it.  I don™t know how ma ny pe ople there we re 
in there.  There was a room full of people.  
They were all Hungarian mostly Hungarian.  
I couldn™t understand most
 of the people unless 
they spoke my language, either Ge
rman or Yiddish, then I underst
ood.   If they wanted me  to 
understand this otherwise, they s
poke Hungarian.  But they treated
 me very well and I actually 
recovered in that pl ace.  The only problem is 
if you™re talking about a place with no way out, 
that™s a  place with no way out.  There™s no 
reason why the Germans would maintain a TB 
hospital inside a concentration camp.  And I stayed
 in that  hospital till th
e mi ddle of M a rch, till 
the end of March.  Nothing much happened.  Ju
st stayed in that hospital, nobody ever came 
there, nobody came to the door.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Were the doctors inside?
 
 
Irving: 
Same doctor that let me  in.  He came–
 
 
Anthony: 
And he never left either?
 
 
Irving: 
We ll, no.  He would go in and out.  He came in and he would go over to some  people 
who didn™t feel well or once in a while would ask 
me  how I fe el.  They would take temperatures 
twice a day and keep a record of 
it.  Oh, I asked him to please take
 my fa ther into the hospital, 
regular hospital and he promised he would and 
I think he did.  Why, I have no idea, but he 
promised.  
 

 
Anthony: 
Was he, was the doctor a German?
 
 
Irving: 
No.  He was a Hungarian Jew.  
 
 
Anthony: 
He was Hungarian also?
 
 
Irving: 
His name  was Doctor We iss.  Ahh, he was a 
very gentle person.  I don™t, we didn™t have 
any problems with him.  And, as far as I™m concer
ned, he was very well liked.  No problems.  He 
would come  in and visit and talk and probably be
 our only link to the outside world.  He would 
go out and come  in and that™s it.  But nobody else
 would–they would bring 
in food, take it back 
and that™s it.  Then one day–
 
 
Tape 2: 
[unable to verify, Tape 2 inaudible]
 
 
Irving: 
And what happen is the people who were in
 the hospital went by fr eight and the people 
who were not in the hospital wa
lked.  And the whole camp was 
evacuated to go to Dachau.  
Now, from what I understand, now, this is from 
a quarterback position, which we didn™t know at 
the time .  Te ddy said that he once, he was going to
 try to run away or escape.  He was walking 
with the people.  And apparently, if there was an
y food, it isn™t a long ride from where we were.  
Kochendorf is some where and near ______[013] some
thing like that and Dachau.  Today ma ybe 
it™s a ride of two hours, two and a half, three hour
s.  But there mi ght have been some  food they 
gave us, it was the war time .  And _____[016] 
from what I understand, Teddy mi ght have taken 
that food from us, from t he sick people.  In 
any case, they locked the ______[017] some ti me s in 
the afternoons.  This was Tuesday afternoon.  
The train started moving.  It moved all day 
Tuesday, all night Tuesday night.  Wednesday morn
ing they opened the doors and they asked if 
there are any people dead.  There 
was four or five people dead.  So we handed them out and they 
took them out.  And they buried them.  I know th
e name  of t he town was Aalen.  I reme mber 
that.  And we traveled all day We dne sday, all night We dnesday.  On Thursday morning, the 
same  procedure.  However, no food, no water.  Th
ey just came and took the dead out.  Thursday, 
some ti me s during the day, we got into an air ra
id.  I don™t know what planes, could have been 
English, could have been American.  _______[028] I m
ean we were all locked in.  we could hear 
bombs, we could hear sirens.  We  could smell fi
re around us.  We  weren™t hit.  The guards were 
running all over.  And then they came back.  We  we
re praying that we would be hit so we could 
get out–and we weren™t.  Again, nothing happene
d.   Thursday night, we  traveled again all 
night.  Friday morning they opened the freight train and took more dead out.  By that time we 

couldn™t give them the dead anymore.  We  didn™t 
have the strength to give the dead.  By that 
time there were very few people in the car who were
 still alive.  On Saturday morning, they came 

aboard to take the dead out.  We
 finally arrive from Dachau Saturd
ay night.  No food, no water.  
Then when we arrived, then two prisoners of Dach
au came out, aboard the freight train.  They 
took us down and lined us, five people in a row 
and put our hands into 
the pockets and one guy 
would put his arm around one end of the five peop
le, the other around the other five, and pick us 
up and took us in like this.  That
™s how strong we weren™t, just 
couldn™t stand on our feet.  How 
ma ny peopl e survived, I don™t know.  Very few, ma ybe
 ten percent.  Whe n we finally got into 
Dachau, it wa s late at night and we begged them to
 give us some thing to drink.  Give us some  
coffee, give us some thing to eat.  They said the 
kitchen is closed, can™t give us anything to eat.  
Finally, after we begged them, they 
brought us some  water.  It was la
te Sa turday night, just got a 
drink of water, no food.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And that was the first time you ha
d water since you got on the train?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, just Tuesday night.  I 
was crawling on the floor.  
I was crawling around, crawling 
on all four, couldn™t walk.  All of a sudden I saw afa miliar face.  It was my father.  He survived 

too.  He was in that transport.  And on Sunday 
morning in Dachau there were showers, there 
were showers in Dachau.  And then they ma de us  take a shower, so the first few people who 

went together to shower, I don™t know why, but they
 turned the hot water on.  And as soon as the 
people got in the shower, they died, they just 
fell down and died.  I don™t know whether the hot 
water did it or what.  
 
 
Anthony: 
It shocked them or some thing like that.  
 
 
Irving: 
Just died.  And we refused to go on then a
nd they changed it.  They changed the hot 
water to a less hot, cool.  Then we
 got past this, and it turned out 
that  this was April the fi rst, 
Easter Sunday.  And on Easter Sunday we alwa
ys figured ma ybe we™ll getŠif we don™t get the 
coffee on Sunday morning, at least we ™re goi
ng to get the soup at noon because every 
concentration campŠbut it turned ou
t this was Easter Sunday, Ap
ril the first, 1944 and one day 
in the year and only in Dachau on 
Easter Sunday they did not give th
at soup.  All they did is give 
a piece of bread and a sl ice of salami .  That™s the 
only time we ever got a slice of salami  in camp 
but they didn™t give it till 4pm on that day.  So
 the fi rst time we got a 
piece of bread, at 4pm on 
that Sunday.  After we got intothe block in Dachau.  That™s how we got to Dachau.  We stayed 

in Dachau fro m April the fi rst till late in April.  Dachau was to me compared to Unterr iexi ngen 

and Vaihingen and Kochendorf, although I didn™t 
see Kochendorf.  But from what I understand 
very few people survived Kochendorf.  Very few 
people who went with to Kochendorf survived.  
Dachau, compared with these camps , was a luxur
y because it had showers, it had water.  There 
was a Red Cross and they brought packages.  My fa
ther used to wear glasses.  He broke his 
glasses and one day he went dow
n to the toilet and he hit himself on the  bed on his leg and it 
wouldn™t heal.  It started to get worse and worse, 
almost greenish like.  They wouldn™t put him in 

the hospital but then by the end of
 April they announced that ther
e™ll be a Red Cross inspection.  
So when the Red Cross guy came him we pushed 
him out in front so the Red Cross guy could 
see him and when he saw what happened to his foot he told the guy who was in charge of the 
block to put him in the hospital.  So my father 
was designated the next day to go in the hospital.  
At the same time the next day they decided to ev
acuate all the Jews from Dachau.  So when my 
father went to the hospital 
in Dachau, I got evacuated.  
 
 
Anthony: 
So you got separated.  
 
 
Irving: 
We  got separated.  He went to 
the hospital and I went on a train.
 
 
Anthony: 
This was the end of April in 1945?
 
 
Irving: 
End of April in 1945.  Don™t know exactly wh
at day in April but towards the end of 
April in 1945.  This time it was a passenger train, 
not a freight train.  We  got a passenger train in 
Dachau.  
 
 
Anthony: 
You got seats and everything?
 
 
Irving: 
Seats.  We  got a package before we got on the train, a food package from Red Cross.  I 
happened to get a Belgian package.
  Other people got other packages
.  That was a food package.  
I don™t know why they put us on the train and where 
they were taki ng us.  
I still don™t know.  It™s 
still a mystery.  But we took off from Dachau and 
went all the way to the Austrian border to a 
small town in Tirol called Zeaphant [ph92].  We
 s t opped right before th
at town.  We  started 
walking up the mountain.  When we walked up 
the mountain a ma n who looked to me  like he 
was the ma yor of Zeaphant [ph100], I don™t know ma
ybe not, but an official in either case, 
stopped us and said that Austria is
 no longer at war and as far as he™s concerned we are no longer 
prisoners; the war is over and we should be free, 
except since Austria didn™t do anything to us he 
cannot feed us.  We  got to go back to Germany bu
t the SS were still there 
with the rifles and the 
machine guns.  Apparently he had 
a long conference with the SS me n. 
 So they kept us overnight 
still under SS guard despite the fact of
 what he said in a barn in the mountains in Tyrol.  The next 
morning they took us back over to Ge rmany.  Th
ere they put us into 
a ravine between two 
mountaintops, set up machine guns on both ends 
and there we were.  I don™t know what they 
intended to do.  There were machine guns.  Ther
e was a whole story abou
t it that there were 
some  wome n who ca me  over and told them that if
 they shoot us they going to be punished or 
some thing or other.  I didn™t see that.  I was mo
st ly with some  of my Hungarian friends from 
Kochendorf and so on.  It was late in the even
ing, towards the evening, I don™t know whether it 

was late or dark when one of them woke me  up 
a nd said look, what we saw is that the SS is 
changing into civilian uniforms .  The  SS was cha
nging into civilian uniforms and disappeared.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Just leaving.  
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah.  The next thing I know is Peel™s 
[ph123] following them a nd going on the road 
and I followed him.  The r e were others crowding.  
There were lots of people
 walking.  This is the 
Eleburna [ph125] Pass, by the way.  There were lo
ts of people walking into Germany.  I just 
joined them, prison uniform and all.  Barefoot
, no shoes, prison uniform.  I  don™t know if the 
moon is on or not.  I can™t tell you but the guy next 
to me , he™s either Italian or Hungarian, not 
German, but  he spoke to me .  I just shook my hea
d.  We  walked all the way into the town and as 
soon as we got into the town the first street I saw 
I just disappeared, ran into
 the first street.  And 
there I started looking for an empty house.  
Saw a house which looked empty and I started 
getting in.  I went to the baseme nt but it wasn™t
 empty.  A guy came  out with a rifle and started 
ma king noises and all these foreigners what are 
you doing in here.  Who is this?  I said very 
quietly and then he went back.  I went to th
e next house and finally 
found an empty houseŠgot 
in there.  And there were three ot
her Hungarians in there.  The four
 of us spent the night in that 
house.  The next morning there was some body on the 
street told us in Hungarian that there is a 
trainload full of sugar at the st
ation, that people are going down th
ere for sugar.  So I went down 
there too.  And there were a lot 
of Germans picking up sugar from 
that train.  I didn™t need the 
sugar but I was looking around.  And 
there was a German lady and she said to me  she wants help 
with the sugar.  At that time I was getting very 
sick, absolutely sick.  I couldn™t eat anymore.  
The thing that I needed most was sleep.  All I wa
nted to do wa s sleep.  So I told her that I will 
help her with the sugar if she lets me  sleep in her house.  And she agreed so I helped her with the 
sugar and we  took it to he r house and she let me
 sleep under the steps in that house until aboutŠ
in the afternoon, ma ybe two o™cl
ock in the afternoon, some thing 
like that.  And then she came 
running in and she said the SS is ru
nning around and she™s afraid and I™
d better get out.  So I left.  
I had no place to go so I sat down on a bench, a to
wn bench and I was sitting there.  I couldn™t go 
any further.  I was sick.  I was very sick.  S
itting there, a man came over in a uniform.  Turned 
out the town mailman, the town mailman, and he 
came over and he said you can™t sit here.  If 
you sit here they™re going to shoot you and th
e Americans are comi ng in tomorrow a nd because 
of that they™re going to punish 
the whole town.  He said, ﬁYou 
come with me and I™ll hide you.ﬂ 
So I went with him.  He put me  in the garage 
and I sat in the mail truck all night.  The Americans 
came in that night, sometime during the night.  
In the morning he came in and said, ﬁNow you 
can come up to my apartment.ﬂ I went up to his ap
artment, asked me what 
I want to do and I said 
all I want to do and I said all I want to do is lay 
down and sleep.  So he let me  sleep in a bed in 
his hallway.  The first thing I hit the bed I fell as
leep as far as I know.  The next thing I know is 
some body is  standing on top of me  and shaki
ng me and shaking me, and a woman screaming, 
ﬁYou can™t die here, you can™t die 
here!ﬂ They were both standing in
 front of me  and saying that, 
ﬁYou have to go to a hospital, you can™t die in he
re.ﬂ That time  they felt that I was dying.  So 
they gave me  a pair of pants and I put them
 on and I started crossing–They showed me  where 

the hospital is across the street .  I st ar ted cr ossing
 the street, went to th
e hospital.  The hospital 
was in a school, in a former school.  It had th
ree steps.  I ha d a hell of a time getting up those 
three st eps.  But I fi nally made it.  I got up the st
eps.  I got up to the hospi
tal, went in.  There was 
a doctor who was an officer, a German officer. 
 First thing he did is stuck me  with a 
thermo me ter.  I didn™t have any temperatur e.  Al ready told me that he cannot accept civilian.  I 

told him I™m not sick, I™m starvi
ng.  I™m dying of starvation.  I need
 help.  So I have to go to a 
civilian hospital.  So walking outside I fell down th
e steps.  And I lay in 
the street; I just lay 
there, I couldn™t get up.  And a jeep came  by.  
A jeep stopped.  A guy ca me out, picked me  up, 
put me  in the back of the jeep, took me  to 
American headquarters.  Two guys came out; one 

spoke Yiddish, one spoke Polish.  They took me  back
 to the hospital, went 
back to the doctor.  
One of the guys took out a gun.  He had a gun; he 
must have been an officer.  Took out the gun, 
went over to the German doctor and said to him in kind of a semi -broken German, he said to 

him, ﬁYou know, he dies, you die.ﬂ A
nd after that he put me  in a be
d, gave me  IV.  I was in that 
hospital until the mi ddle of June.  
 
 
Anthony: 
And this was in early Ma y?
 
 
Irving: 
Yeah, in the mi ddle of Germany in a military hospital.  It was a German military hospital 
in Mittenwald [187].  It was a place called Mi
ttenwald in Germany.  And that™s where I was 
when the war ended.  
 
 
Anthony: 
What did you do after the war?  
 
 
Irving: 
I spent several years in a displaced person camp 
in Stuttgart.  I went back to Munich and 
got a high school diploma.  I took an exam and go
t a high school diploma.  I went for a short 
time to a Polish university, Polytechni c, then I sw
itched over to the German Polytechnic and then 
I left  for the United Stat es.
 
 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber what year that was?
 
 
Irving: 
1948; January 1948 I came to the United States
 and by now I work as an engineer and 
design naval combat systems.  
 
 
Anthony: 
That™s gr eat.  
 
 

Irving: 
And I do have several degrees now.  I did continue my education.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Did you find Poland and Germany different afte
r the war or was it the same attitude 
towards Jews?
 
 
Irving: 
I never went back.  Germany yeah, Poland I never went back.  I wa s in Germany after 
the war.  I spent three years in Germany; 1945 
to 1948.  Did I find it different?  Yeah, I guess.  I 
guess it is different.
 
 
Anthony: 
Is there anything else you™d like to say?
 
 
Irving: 
We ll, now you™ve got the stor y of my life 
until today.  Right now I™m happy I™m in the 
United States.  In fact, I spent two years in the U.S.  Ar my.  
 
 
Anthony: 
When were you in the army?
 
 
Irving: 
From 1950 to 1952.  
 
 
Anthony: 
Well, I think we™re all done.  
 
 
Irving: 
Okay, fine.
