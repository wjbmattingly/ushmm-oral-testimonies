As you know, the Holocaust was the state
-
sponsored 
persecution
 
--
 
thank youf or turning 
that off. Th a t's gre a t 
--
 s
ystematic persecution of Jewr y by 
Nazi Germ any and itscollaborators between1943 and 1945.  Jews were the
 
p ri ma ry vic t i m s .   
Some six m illion Jews, m en, wom en,and children, were killed.  Millions of others,however , 
were also persecuted, ens
l
aved, and som eof them  also killedbecause of this racial visionof  
the Nazi society.
 
 
In today's program , we're going to meet Julius Menn.T here he 
is as a young boy. W e'll take about 45 m inutes tohear him and getto know his story.  I 

prom ise, especially since the group is so intim ate, I try to leave a lot of time atthe end sothat 
you can ask him questions and get your questions answered.
 
 
T his is Julius Menn as a young boy.  He was born in1929at 
what was then the Free City of  Danzig.  T oday we know it as
 
Gdansk, Poland, on the Baltic 
S
ea.
 
 
In 1935 Julius andhis fam ily lef t Europefor Palestine. T hey 
returned to Europe in the summ er of 1938, so just a couple of years later, inorder to visit wi th 

relatives that they had left behind.  Here we see Julius and his younger sister Bella and their 
Germ an govern
e ss 
inW arsaw, Poland. They plannedto stay the summ er,but as often would 
happen, their stay was extendedfor more than a year. 
 
 
Unfortunately, their stay coincided, eventually, with the Germ an 
invasion of  Poland.  Here you see am ap ofPoland.  It looks very d ifferentthan itdoes today.  

T he red arrow shows m oreor less the path that Julius' fam ily took infleeing the German

invasion.  I want to especially point out a couple of features. This isDanzig, the Free State.  
T his isBialystok that plays a signif icant role today.  And approxim ately where thearrow en
ds is 
the little town, railway head, of Molodeczno. T hat's an importantfeature today.  And what 
we're going to call Vilnius
,  
but at the tim e the 
P
o ls  c a lle d it  
V
ilna, a city in northeasternPoland.
 
Germ any invaded Poland.  And the Mennfamily f led eastward seeking to escape the German 

advance. Theyf led with other refugees and spent two weeks wandering through thef orest 
andf ields of eastern Poland, eventually arri vi ng in the town of  Molodeczno.  Again, the 
approxim a
t
ion of that railhead.  They mettheoccupied area of Poland.  Andfortunately the 
Soviet off icerhelped them  geta train to Vilnius. T hey lived in the old historic ghetto.
 
>> Julius Menn:  You don't need to go into allthedetails.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
You got it. 
 
 
T here is Julius'fa
m ily
:   h is  
mother, f ather, and younger sister 
Bella.  Here they are safely again back inT elAvi v in October
 
1940. Julius, of course, is onthe 
far right and hism other andhis sister.  Juliusjoins the Haganah,a Jewish def ense 
organization.  And here he
 
is asa young off icer later inthe Haganah.
 
 
Julius eventually em igrates to the UnitedStates
,  
where he 
began his studies at the University of  Calif ornia, Berkeley.  Buthe still has connections to 
Palestine.  Here we see the dedication of hisfather'sf actory, his cem entf actory.  And you'll 
noticethat seated here in the m iddle isthe prim em inister,f orm er prim e minister
,  
of  Isra e l. 
 
>> Julius Menn: Thank you, Bill.  It's very nice to see you.  Ihave talked here anum ber of  

t im e s .  Us u a lly it ' s  f u llb
ecause a lotof  schools, also. But I guess it's f inals, so we don't see 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

m any schools today. But it'snice to see you. 
 
 
Bill already told you quite abit of m y story.  Iwant to prefacem y 
story by telling you that I considerm yself  theaccidental survivor becauseI was never
 
--
 
we  
were never in concentration camps,but we were alm ost in concentration camps. And also for 
the sakeof  thehigh school students, if  thereare any here
 
--
 
here, Isee som e.  I want you
 
--
 
in  
m y story, it's ver y im portant that you project yourself  when you were 10 years old.  All the 

terrible things thathappened tom ehappened when I was 10, going on11, starting atage9 
actually.
 
 
B ill
 
--
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Bill ism y dad. He's not here. 
 
>> Julius Menn: W ill.  Sorry.
  
D r.
 
Meinecke, yes.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
T hat m akes m y mother happy. 
 
>> Julius Menn: I was born in1927
 
--
 
Im ean1929.  In Danzig.  AndasW ill indicated, it was a 
Free City.  My f ather was a soldier in the 
I
mperial Russian Arm y in W orldW ar I.  It was a 
terrible war.  He lost the toes on one of hisfeet. They f roze on thefront.  So whenthe 
Russian 

R
evolution broke out,he escaped. And he escaped to Danzig
,  
because Danzig was 
establishedby the League of  Nationas an independent, small country.
  
T he foreign policy was 
under Poland,but other wise it was an independent entity.
 
 
I guess m y life startedout
 
--
 
f or a Native
-
Am erican it would be 
ver y hard becauseI spoke with m y m other inGerm an, with m yf ather I spoke either Russian or 
Germ an, and ev
entually I spoke Hebrewism .  Especially when we m oved to Palestine. Also, I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

had a 
Germ an gove
r
ness.  Germ an was m y first language. 
 
 
Life in Danzig was actually quite pleasant. Irecall when the 
Nazis cam e to power in Germ any,
 
there was quite a strong Nazi party in Danzi g.  But they did 
nothave the anti
-
Sem itic or raceattitudes.  Iusedto go with a landlady's son who wore a 
swastika arm  bandto the greatm arket in Danzi g to buy live f ish. And there was noproblem .  
Except when we went to Palestine in 1935, he said, 
ﬁW
ell, abig war wi ll s wallo w you when 
you're in the Mediterranean.
ﬂ
  
Of course, thatscared m e.  I was 6 years old. And maybe this 
was ver y dram atic. 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
W e came to T el Aviv
 
--
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
W hy leave Danzig if  lif e was so good there? 
 
>> Julius Menn:  Myf ather
 
--
 
Iforgot tom ention.  Myfather was a Zionist. W hether you 
were 
religious or not religious 
--
 
m y parents were not religious, but he was what you m ight say a 
p o lit ic a l Z io n is t . T
hef eeling was the only place where Jews could live asf irst

would have to be intheir own country.
 
 
Actually, today there are only two places

United States and 
Isra e l. 
 
 
So he wanted to gotoPalestine.  It was occupiedby the British. 
It was what was called a Britishm andate, which means it was a British colony.  So all the 
people who lived there, whether they were Ar abs or Jews, they were  se

You got the brown passport. The British passport was a blue passport.
 
 
Nevertheless, he andhis brother, who alsoescapedf rom  
Russia, they went
 
--
 
we went to Palestine.  They bought some m ountainous land near 
Jerusalem
,  
where they eventually established a cem entfactory. 
 
 
It was a wonderf ulplace.  It was som ething that is maybe even 
foreign toAmerican children today, because it was ver y saf e. It was nota very li ve cit y
,  
b u t it 
was ri ght on the Mediterranean. And I recallwhen I
 
was inf irst grade or second grade,af ter 
school you just walked by yourself  to the beach, took a bath in theMediterranean, and went 
home. And nothing happened to you. People didn't lock their homes because there was no 
crim e. T here were about300,000
 
people livi ng thereat that time inT elAvi v.  Of course now 
it's ver y diff erent
, not
 
only in the United States
,  
but alsothere and everyplace else.
 
 
Of course, when I came to Tel Aviv
,  
to Palestine, I didnot know 
Hebrew.  AndI recall that whenI was in
 
f irstgrade, the teacher would read" Robinson Caruso"  
in Hebrew to the kids.  I didn't understanda word.  So in recess I would say to the teacher, 
who was also in exile from  Germ any
 
--
 
he knew Germ an, of  course.  I said, 
ﬁP
lease tell m e 
quickl y in Germ an
 
what the story is.
ﬂ
  
W ell, this went onfor a while. But after threemonthsI 
spoke Hebrew.  And children learn languages ver y f ast.
 
 
It was a wonderf ul town.  There were sportsactivities.  School 
was f un.  Going to thebeach was fun.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me i
necke:
  
So you were happy having to m ove to Palestine?
 
>> Julius Menn: Oh, yes.  It was great.

>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Your wholef am ily was happy at the change?
 
>> Julius Menn:  Yes,except m y mother.  My m other was a youngwom an. She was 31when 
we  
went to Palestine. And she camef rom  awealthy hom e. Atthattim e in Palestine, you're to 
do everything by yourself.  Youhad to cookon a contraption that was on kerosene
,  
because 
electric stoves, gas stoves, only ver y wealthy people could afford it
,  
an
d youhad tohave the 
piping and soon to have the gas.
 
 
Shedidn't adjust well at all.  I guess shef elt like an exile.  Not 
m e, not m yf ather,not m y little sister. T he governess took care of us.  My parents traveled a 

lot.  My m other decided to goto visit herf am ily in Poland. And thiswas com ing to 1938, which 
was cra zy because everybody
 
--
 
all the newspapers, everybody knew all over Europe that the 
Germ ans are going toattackPoland. Nevertheless, we went toPoland in 1938. T hatf irst 

summ er I spent with my grandmother.  Abig forest, you saw the map before,near Vilna. My 
grandfather was already dead.  He owneda very large f orest,maybe thousands of acres. He 
hadam ulchfactory in Bialystok, among other things.  Som y f atherwas in Danzi g trying to 
settle some business.  And I went with m y gra ndmother to her cabin in thef orest.
 
 
T hat was a wonderful tim e. Polandhasbeautif ulforests, lake.  I 
would go collect wild m ushroom s andberrieswith m y grandmother. I learned how to 
segregate the poisonous mushroom sf rom the edible ones, which I've f orgotten by now.  It was 
wonderful. 
 
 
T he summ er passed. W e didn't gobacktoPalestine, as we 
were supposed to.  Sowe m oved toW arsaw.  I was enrolled in aPolish school.  Ididn't know 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

a word of  Polish.  So can you imagine? I had to start in a Polish school and learn Polish and 
all the subjects were in Polish.
 
 
Andalso, it was thef irst tim e where I really felt being 
discrim inated against. Poland is 90% Catholic.  Attha
t time
 
--
 
well, bef ore the war
 
--
 
the war 
sta rts S ep tem be r. T
his is the summer, late summ er of 1939.  10%of  the population were 
Jewish.  T here were about 
3 
m illio n .  A n d 3 0
 
m illio n  P o ls .
 
 
So thef irsthour,the schools,there was no separationof  religion 
f rom  secular activities.  So
 
thef irsthour was catechism , Catholic catechism .  For thefew 
Jewish students in the class, they had to leave the classroom and wait outside.  I thought this 

was ver y strange.  But nevertheless,this is how you feel, that you'rea minority.
 
>> Dr.  W illia
m  Meinecke:
  
W as therea particular incident of anti
-
Sem itism that you rem ember 
f rom  the school?
 
>> Julius Menn:  Notf rom the school, no. There was one later.  No, notat that time.
 
 
In that summ erof  1939, after the school year, 1938
-
1939 school 
ended, 
m y m oth e r,m y siste r
,  
and I went to a resort. Toobad we don't have them ap o
n a gai n .   
Near the
 
--
 
near the E
ast Prussian border, very nice, pleasant.  Came Septem ber
 
1, 1939, the 
Germ ans invaded, so there was a greatpanic among the grownups.W ehad to leave because 
it was so close to theGerm an border.W e wentback to Bialystok,where m y grandm other 
lived, had a big house.  And, of course, as soon as we arri ved there, we also experienced the 
bombing andm achinegunning of  the German airplanes.
 
>> D r .  W
illiam  Meinecke:
  
Isthat thef irst you knew of  the invasion? 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
>> Julius Menn:  Yes. T he Germ ans usedaf ighter bom ber, a Stuka.  As it was diving, it had a 
siren.  And it wouldm ake thisawf ul noise
, 
which not only was to kill people but also to scare 
people. And it certainly scared people.
 
 
So as soon as we arrived at m y grandm other's house 
--
 
I was 10 
--
 
I was put to work. W e had to dig ditches inthe yard sothat when the German planes cam e, 
we  w
ould hide in the trenches.  And we had to tape the windows because it was believed that 
there wouldbe gas warfare.
 
 
My m other went back
 
--
 
m y m other went by train toW arsaw.  
W arsaw was one of the last places in Poland that stoodup to the Germ ans.  Andb
efore it was 
com pletely surrounded, it resisted the Germ ans about two weeks.  Shefound my father.  I 
don't know how.  And they cam e back by train toBialystok.
 
 
T he Germ ans were only about15
 
m iles away, theGerman 
Arm y.  My f ather decided we cannot stay there, we have to leave.  So by strange quirk of  luck, 
hefoundm y grandfather's old coachm an.  As I mentioned bef ore, my grandf ather was ver y 
wealthy.  He was a gre at philanthropist. He did a lot of wonderf ul things for the poor people.  
And he helped th
is coachm an,also, substantially.
 
 
So
 
this coachman,maybe a f ew day
s  af t e rmy f a t he r a rri ve d
 
--
 
m usthave been around the 3rdor 4th of Septem ber
 
--
 h
e came with this long wagon f illedwith 
straw and covered, like a covered wagon.  Sothink of the pioneers who went west.  It was very 

sim ilar wagon.  Som y m other,m y father, m ysister and I, we piled in. W emoved east. I 
guess m y father wanted to get toVilnaor actually get close to the Russianborder so if  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

11
 
necessary to escape into Russia. 
 
 
So f or two w
eeks we wandered in the f orestsof  Poland.  
Actually, a distancef rom  Vilna it was not thatgreat.  It was maybe less than 200
 
m iles, but you 
hadto go throughforests andf ields. T hef ew roads,they were covered, I remember, with 
refugees, animals, cars,
 
cars.  People
 
--
 
cars, they would drive them  until they ran out ofgas
,  
andthen they would abandonthem .  And the German Stukas were com ingm aybe several 

tim esa day.  They wo uld dive bom b andm achine gunthe ref ugees.
 
 
T ha t  a
reahad a lot ofwheat 
f ie ld s ,  a
nd the wheat was ripe.  It 
was ver y tall.  And there was nobody to harvest it because thefarm ers were in the Polish Arm y 
andthey were gone. So we would lie in thewheatf ield.W hentheplanes lef t, go backtothe 
c a rt .
 
 
T he roads were covered with pieces of human bodies, dead 
animals, sm oking cars.  It was horrible. Fortunately, you know, I was 10. Em otionally you 
don't remember thatmuch, butI can visualize  some of it but not very well. 
 
 
W hen I saw on television thepicturesof  the tornado
 
tha t h it the  
town in Iowa and the total destruction, that rem indedm eof  war. T his is what war is.  Im agine 
you go to work, you com e hom e, and there'sno house.  It's all gone. T his is what war is like.
 
 
Eventually
,  
a s  D r.
 
Meineckem entioned, we passed 
a  num be r  of  
sm all towns. W hat did we eat? W ell,that's very interesting.  This was Septem ber. T here 
were a lot of apples. So thef irst several days we only ate apples.
  
Im agine if  youonly eat 
apples.  One thing happensto you. You getdiarrhea.

12
 
 
T he
 
second week we cam e to a poultry farm ,andm y father 
boughta lot of  raw eggs.  So we ate 
--
 
f or several days only ate raw eggs.  He would say, 
ﬁY
ik e .
ﬂ  
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
How do 
you 
eat raw eggs? 
 
>> Julius Menn:  You sort of m ake a hole andswallo w it.  It doesn't taste very good.  But you 
m aybe want to try it. My dog likes it. 
 
 
So apples, raw eggs.  T hen we cam eto a small town that was 
also mentioned by Dr.
 
Meine
cke
, Molodeczno.  It was a railroad junction.  Now it is in Belarus.  
T hen it was Poland.  In fact,most of those small towns that we travel ed through are now either 
Belarusor Ukraine. They are not Poland anym ore becauseStalingave the easternpartof  
Poland to these two new countries, Ukraineand Belarus. 
 
 
T he coachm an said, 
ﬁ
I hav
e to leave you here.
ﬂ
  
Sohe left us on 
the railroad, sort of on theplatform .W e didn't know what to do. W e heard this rum ble.  It 
becam e louder and louder and louder. And then we saw these tanks com ing. We were 
convinced thatthey were German tanks. 
 
Butthey were Russian tanks. T hey had the red star.
 
 
Politically, historically, what you m ay want torem em ber, is that 
this was underthe secret treaty that was signed in1938 between Stalin and Hitler. T hey 
decided that whentheGerm ans invaded Poland,
 
that Poland would be divided between the 
Russians and theGerm ans.  Andthat areawhere we were was tobe occupied by the 

Ru ssia n s.  
 
So pretty soonthis Russian off icer cam eon the platf orm , started 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
talking tom y f ather.  And at som epoint he asked him , 
" A
re you Jewi sh?
ﬂ
  
M
y f a t h e r  sa ys,  
" Ye s. ﬂ
  
He says, " I'm  Jewish also
, 
so how 
can 
I help you?
ﬂ
  
I
n themeantim e, he gave m y sister 
a chocolate
 
bar, which was ver y unusual, chocolate in thosedays. My father said, 
ﬁW
ell,  we  
want to go to Vilna.
ﬂ
  
He  s a id
, ﬁ
I'll put youona m ilitary train.
ﬂ
  
And he put us on a Russian 
m ilitary train.  And we arrived in Vilna.  My gr andm other hada house there, but thehousewas 
locked. She was in Bialystok. 
 
 
So som ehow, which I don't remember very cl early, we got to our 
fa
rm , in the countryside near Vilna, where m y grandmotherhad abig estate. We stayed there 
for abouttwo weeks.  What I rem em ber is I learned how to ride a cow.  I m ust tell you, riding a 
cow is extrem ely diff icult and hazardous. 
 
 
T henm y father learned
 -- 
it was ver y com plicated politics those 
days.  Vilna would be given to Lithuania, which was still independent. So we went backto 
Vilna. W ehad no money.  So we lived f or several m onths in the Jewish ghetto.
 
 
Vilna, historically, has a very r ich Jewish history that's over 
1,000 years old. T he Jews went there when the king, them agnif icent, gave them a 
constitution, invited them  to com eto 
--
 
f rom  Germ any to Poland to establish tradesand settle 
the country.  
 

 
So I was enrolled inaJewish school.  Because there were so 
m any Jews in Poland,they had anetwork of schools. They were called culture.  In Hebrew it's 

calledT arbut. All the subjects were taught inHebrew except you had totake the country 
language also.  So the Hebrew part was easy because I
 
knew it.  But the country language
, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
14
 
that was Lithuanian.  For that school year
,  
Ihad to learn Lithuanian andLithuanian history.  
An d
,  
believe me,Lithuania isa small country, but it has an extrem ely com plicated language.  
Maybe that's why it has sofew
 
Lithuanians.
 
[Laughter]
 
 
T he school was about, walking, about half  anhour or25m inutes 
f rom  where we lived in the ghetto.  Vilna has a winter thatm ay beascold or colder than 
Minnesota.  I didn't have any warm  clothes, so toprotectm y legs f rom f reezing, m y m other 
would rub m y legs with  animalf at. Soas I walked to school, I wouldstay warm.
 
 
At that school I meta boy who was, unf ortunately, also 
crem ated, gassedby the Germ ans, whosefather was a lawyer.  He was a wealthy boy
.   Hi s  
name was [
Indiscernible]. 
 
I remem berhis nam e.  After school I would come to hishouse,and 
his m other would give m e a warm  meal.W ewould listen surreptitiously in
 
--
 
in the Polish 
broadcast. I would go home andtell m yf ather an extract.  Remember, I was 10.  A
n e xt r a c t  of  
thenews.  It was a horrible place where we lived.  It was one room . At nightm iceor rats 
would com e out through the raf ters.  
 
 
It didn't last very long to be Lithuania. The Russians tookover 
those Baltic countries and abolished the indep
endence. And they established a curf ew sothat 
whoever was not home by
 
10:00
 
at night was shot.  Notarrested, shot. So m y parents would 
go to meet other refugees, and they tended to be hom e, shall we say, exactl y at 10:00
 
o r 
m aybe a f ew m inutes af ter.  
So im agine, I was so worried.  I hadtowatch m y sister
, w
ho was 
f ive years younger than I. And wondering, are they going to be home in timenottobe shot?

My f athertried to get som ehow out, not to goback to Palestine.  Hehadone valuable 
docum ent that was aBritish certif icate whichwould say that we areallowed to go back to 
Palestine. Butthe question was how you can go.
 
 
W ell, if  youhad money, you couldf ly f rom  Vilna to 
Stockholm , 
andf rom Sweden youcould go anywhere.  Sweden was
 
o f f ic ia lly a  
neutral country.  
Otherwise, theonly other way was to som ehow get back through Russia. 
 
 
T wo things happened in our favor.  One, he had this oldf riend 
f rom  theold capitalofLithuania who gave m y father the equivalentof about
 
$5,000.  I 
r e m em be r ,  i n  19
39 this was quite a bit of m oney.  Butpeople helpedeachother in those days.  
T hey really did. W ith this m oney he was able, m yf ather, to get a transit permit to go through 

Russia.  Andbeing a Comm unist country, there were no private enterprise.  It was all state 
enterprise.  So you had toprepay ever ything, theticketsfor the train,f or thehoteland soon.
 
 
So we actually arri ved.  It was October
 
1940. In Moscow.
  
T h is  
was like a Kaf ka story.  I remember this. W earrived.  T hey took us to this hotel calledthe 
Savoy.  During the days it was a ver y f ancy hotel. I rem em ber in the dining room  ithad these 
big windows, thesedrapes that weref alling apart, big chandeliers covered with cobwebs. And 
we were the only guests in the dining room .  Big m enus, almost likebooks. The waiter in 
tattered tuxedo.  Myf ather would say, 
ﬁW
ell, we want to eat this and this.
ﬂ
  
H e  sa ys ,
 
ﬁN
o .   W e 
don't have it.
ﬂ
  
Only thing was ever y day you had stew.  Three tim es a day. 
 
 
Af ter two days or so, when we were ready to leave, the waiter 
said, 
ﬁW
ell, you'll be going for three days ona train to Odessa, on the 
B
l a c k 
S
ea, but there 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

won't be any f ood.
ﬂ
  
So m y father gave him  two silk ties, and he gave us a roasted goose. And 
that sustained usfor the trip. 
 
 
T henf rom Odessa we went by Russian ship to 
T urkey and f rom  
T
urkey back toPalestine.  And that's another story. W e came to Palestine.  TheGermansand 
the Italians were bombing Palestine atthe time because there was a big ref inery in Haifa. So I 
spent many nights in a shelter.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
You were older then? W ere you af raid of the bom bing when you 
were in Palestine? 
 
>> Julius Menn: W ell, this is an interesting question.  I talk to schoolchildren quitea bit.  And 

a seventh grader asked me once I think a very prof ound question. W hen Italked about, in 
Poland, running into the wheatf ields when the Germ an Stukas were dive bombing the 
refugees, he said, 
ﬁW
ere you af ra
id ?
ﬂ
  
And Itold him , I said, 
ﬁ
We
ll,
ﬂ 
I told the group, 
ﬁ
a  ch ild 
cannot be af raid likean adult,ﬂ which m eans
 
to have a continuousfear.  You canonly beaf raid 
of  s om e th i
ng that happens that instant,and that instant when you hear theterrible sirenand 
y
ou hear them achineguns and the bombsfalling.  But once theplanes leave, you're notaf raid 
anym ore. And thism akes children norm al
 s
o that they can live asf unctioning adults.
 
 
Adults m ay have f ears and anxieties that last forever.  But 
children are different in this respect.  SoI think this answers your qu estion. 
 
 
I want to leave tim ef or questions.  Actually, you can read a lotof  
it.  I wrote a little book that is, if Im ay say so, it's not expensive.  It'scalled "

what was there. W ell, all I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

17
 
want to say is that when I was 15, I joinedthe Jewish underground, the Haganah,thatf ought 
for the independenceofthe country. W hen Iwas 17, I was a junioroff icer.  I had
 
problem s 
with m y parents. W e lived in a sm all apartm ent. W e were poor. I went to California by m yself.  

I was 18.  I was accepted in Berkeley.  I wentfor one sem ester. And then when the 
W
ar  of  
I
ndependence broke out, I volunteered and I went back
 
to  
Israeland Ifought in theW
a r o f  
I
ndependence. And after the war I went back to work and got m y Ph.D. 
in
 
B i o ch e m i st r y.  
 
 
So I will conclude here and open it to questions.  I'm  sure that 
you wi ll have a num ber of questions
, w
hich I'll be very pleased toanswer. 
 
 
T hank you.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
So what happened to your sister? 
 
>> Julius Menn: She lives near La Jolla.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
W hat happened to your m other andother relatives?  Do you know?
 
>> 
Julius Menn:  My motherdied
.  M y
 
f ather died.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
And your grandm other?
 
>> Julius Menn: Oh, yeah.  My grandm other, it's interesting.  She stayed in Bialystok.  She 
experienced the German invasion of  World W ar I
, w
here they wer ef irst under the Russian 
occupation.  She said, 
ﬁW
ell, the Germ ans were m uch better than the Russians.  So when the 
Germ ans com e this tim e, we'll bef ine.
ﬂ 
 
W ell, since Bialystok was given to the Russians, she, as a 
capitalist, was exiled to Siberia with her 
daughter

law and her son. So she survived.  She

cam e back.  Shediedthere.
 
 
One sm all vignette.  My late aunt, who was also exiled toa 
separate place
 
--
 
oneof  the Gulags in Kazakhstan
,  
which was quite a desolate place
 
--
 
in  
Poland she was a school t
eacher
, a
nd she was a very intelligent wo m an. W here she lived, the 
natives were sheep herders.  And the sheephad scabies, which is a skin diseaset
ransm itted 
by m ites. Sulf ur curesit.  So she remembered that som ehow.  Andshe told those Kazakhs, 
ﬁB ri n g
 
m e the heads of your m atches
,ﬂ
 
because the matches in those days, they were sulf ur 
heads. T hey knew the heads of them atches
Œ  ﬁ
bring m ethe headsof  your matches and bring 
m e the anim al fat.
ﬂ
  
And she made an ointm ent. The Kazakh 
s
hepherds used itand it worked.  
And theSoviet com munists eventually cam eand want
ed
 
to sendher to medical school 
because they said youreally know what to do. W ell, shedidn't go to medical school.  She 
went
 
--
 
m y f ather helped her come to Palestine af ter the war.  She became an arts and crafts 
teacher.
 
 
But I remember this story because it's such creative story of  
human ingenuity.  Shewas able tohelpthesepeople, andthey helped her.They gave her 

food. W hatever sheneeded. 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Other questions? 
 
Yes, m a'am? 
 
>> Af ter what you hadbeen through, to endup in Calif ornia on a college campus with people 
who probably had littleunderstanding of  your lif e as compared totheir
 
own, what did thatfeel 
lik e ,  t
hese kind of  innocentbabes that youencounter
ed
 
there in California
? 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
So after everything you had been through, how did itf eel tobe in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
Calif ornia at auniversity with people whohadno understanding of  what youhad been 
through?
 
>> Julius Menn: Actually, I was f ortunatebecausea lot of m y classm ates were returningG.I.'s 
f rom  the war in Europe.  I would say these were serious students who experienced war.  So 
they were ver y f riendly.  I wasf ortunate in that respect. 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Julius, you're making m enervous.  Youhave to step back f rom  the 
edge.
 
[Laughter]
 
 
Do we have another question?  Here com esthem icrophone. 
 
>> You said you were secular.  Did youever practice any Jewish traditionsor any of  the 

Jewish religion as you were going through all of  this?
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
So you said you were secular, but did youf ollow any of  the Jewish 
religion? 
 
>> J u liu s  Me n n :  W ell, wi ll s a y t h is .  
 
80% of Israelis are secular today.  Butf or theholidays, 
when I grew up, they convertedm ovie houses into synagogues. So for the high holidays they 
were f illed with people, which is the Jewish N
e w 
Year, and the D
a y o f  
A
tonement
, 
which 
com es 10 days later, Yom  Kippur.  So that'swhat we went to. Andthat's80%of thepeople.  

And that still exists today basically.
  
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Another question. Hold on.  He's got them icrophone. 
 
>> T hank you.  Youmentionedthat yourf am ily went back to Poland, and it was in the news 
thatthe Germ ans would invade. It sounds like they stayed m uch longer than any rea
sonable

person
, 
looking back
,  
would have stayed. W hat was behindtheir staying? 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
So when yourf am ily went back to Poland, they heard allof  thatstuff  
in the news and yet they stayed longer thana reasonable person would stay.  S
o he wondered 
wh y they stayed.
 
>> Julius Menn: I think it was a ver y unreasonable action. And I still don't understand ittothis 
day.  Even when we went to Polandf rom T elAvi v on a ship, I was only 9.  I had terrible 
headaches, because Iwas so disturbed thatwe are leaving m y hom eto go to som e strange 
place. Yes, I can'texplain it.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
T he way you were  talking, it sounded like nom atter where you 
wound up, you were happy.  Do youhave am em ory
 
--
 
were you ahappy child?
 
>> J u l i
us Menn:  Yeah.  I would say by and large, yes.  I'm basically a positive person. 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Ithinkthe question was over here, Nick. 
 
>> In learning a lot about Polish history or during this time, there'sa lot that I have read about 

that
 
Pols would lookf or opportunitiesto takefrom  the Jews, wouldn't always help out the Jews, 
m aybe were glad to see the Jews go.  But your experience,I'm sure it wasn't perf ect, but were 

there, you know
 
--
 
didyou see thatpartof the Polish experience? W ere there close calls wi th 
transports todeath cam ps? 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
She's learned a lot about Polish history during this tim e period. It 
seemedtoherm aybe there would be a lotof  
P
ols that would be happy to seethe Jews leave.  
She wondered if  youexperienced that sideof Poland
. 
>> Julius Menn: W hen we were in Vilna, some of the Polish kids 
--
 
this was 1940
 
--
 
they would 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
21
 
call m e, " Jew, go back to Palestine."  At thebeginning it sounded very insulting, but I would tell 
th em ," I wa n t to  
go  ba ck . "
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Other questions? Here in thef ront. 
 
>> Is there something that you've learned bybeing a survivor?  Like sometimes cancer 

s u r vi vo r s  wil l  s a y t h
at they've learned som ething by their experience. W ould youhave turned 
out the same way hadyou not gone back to Poland? 
 
>> Julius Menn: If  I learned som ething being a survivor.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
W hatm eaning have you drawn f rom it?
 
>> Julius Menn: That this should never happen again.  And whenI talk to groups like you or to 
schools,If eel very strongly that people understand what horrors encounteredpeople.  It's like 
what happened in the Sudan or whathappened in Cambodia or thebombing.  T hese were 
inhum an actions carried out by hum ans. And the only wa y to prevent itf rom happening aga
in  
is by telling the stories, even asm inusculeasthe story m ight be.  I was not ina concentration 
cam p. T he only thing that I really experienced was being uprootedandthose Germ an 
bo
mbings.  But this was hard.T his was enough.
 
 
But I'm  thinking about the other stories. There are very f ew 
survi vors lef t. I think the purposeof  this museum  is really a m em orial to teachus and rem ind 
us that we should not comm it inhum anity toward othe
rs .
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
Another question? 
 
>> You were speaking
 
--
 
what worries m e today is I'm not really sure
 
--
 
there's atrocities going 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
on allover the world, on somepretty large scales, Af rican country and soforth.  Sometim es I 
wonder if  we still havethe same
 
--
 
I don't know if  
you 
would call it backbone or sam e gumption 
or ability we had back then as a society, country, or a world to deal with it a
s su cce ssf u lly,  

even though it was difficult.  Do 
--
 
do you think we could survive such a thing 
today?
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
I'll paraphrase. It's a long question. Back then it seemedthat the 
United States had the rail and backbone to put a stop to what the Nazis were doing.  Today he 
sees atrocities happening all around us again
, 
but no one s
eem stobe able to stop it.  Do
 
you 
think if  sucha thing were to happen again today we would f ind the will and backboneto stop 

it ?  
 
>> Julius Menn: I've beenthink
in g
 
about theUnited States.  I think the United States, it would 
never happen because it's a hodgepodge of different people.  So who are you going to 
persecute
?T he Hispanics? T he Jews? T he Chinese? T he Japanese? TheAmerican 
Indian? TheAmerican Indian is alm ost extinct anyhow.
  
So this would not happen. T he 
Germ ans
 
a re
 
hom ogeneous people.  Even though many of  them  tried tooppose Hitler, they 
are disciplined people
, 
so they obeyed. And they obeyed a terrible regim e. 
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :
  
It rem inds m e 
of  
aquestion I asked him  today.  He spe
aks so many 
different languages: 
 
Hebre
w, Ge rm an , P o lish.
 
>> Julius Menn:  Russian.
 
>> Dr. W illia m  Me in e ck e :

>> I understand that your grandf atherhad agreat dealof  land. W here is that land

what 
happened to that land in thef am ily?

So inthese program s we like tom ake sure you have the last word.  
So, please, leave them with an inspiring m essage.

ciate that you came and you partook of  what 
I h ad  to sa y, t

I will onl y tell you a little story.  There was a great Jewish sage 
about
