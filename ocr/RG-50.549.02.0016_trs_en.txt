Interview with Leo Bretholz 
June 4, 1998 
Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: Just make sure we™re recording 
here. Why don™t you just say a few words and -
- say your name. 

Answer: A few simple words? Leo Bretholz is
 my  name and recording Holocaust stories 
is my  game. Although, I like to stay away from it, base -- I never bring up the subject 

when we sit. It™s not -- I™m not a -- a dwe
ller on -- on the -- on the events. I don™t exult in 
the word survivor, because th
at, to me, is almost like a -- become an object of -- of 
curiosity. Those who are no longer here, they 
are the real people that should be paid 
attention to. Because if we don™t rememb
er them, you know, we™ll kill them all over 
again. But the word survivor to me connotes
 something that™s always a -- a special group 
and you know, when I speak to people and then they say, ﬁDo you have a number?ﬂ I 

say, ﬁNo, I don™t have a number, because if 
I were -- had been in a position to get a 
number, chances are 99 or 999 out of 1000 that
 I wouldn™t be speaking to you here. So 

once I don™t have the number, I am no longer that
 object of curiosity and I™m losing some 
-- I™m lo-losing some credibility, you know. They
 want to  hear that oh, you™re in 
Auschw -- well, if you™re in Auschwitz, you™re 
not here to tell the story. Some of them 
are, but the majority of them are not. It™s 
enough that I escaped from a train and even that 
was -- in that train out of -- out of 1000,
 only seven -- out of 1000, 773 were gassed on

arrival. So, even that is sort of a -- a -- a pe
rcentage to -- to -- to be -- to be taken into 
consideration, you know, so anyway. Now I said 
mo re than what you wanted me to say.  
Q: Let me make sure I™m getting all this on ta
pe. I want to begin with talking about the 
events, maybe the weeks or days leading up 
to the end of the war and where you were 
and what you were doing. 
A: Well, the end of the -- the days of the 
end of the war, after I had lived through the 
liberation in France. Paris was liberated on 
the 25th of August, 1944. And then the war 
ended in ‚45. I was still in France and originally
 I had papers to come to the United States 
in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that
 there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans 
[indecipherable] entered the war. So, the papers
 that I had then, which was the affidavit 
of support, which we got from our relatives here
, that expired. And of course after that, I 
went through all my  adventures to deportation and the escape and the jail and everything. 

But in ‚45, at the end of the war, I was in 
France and was awaiting the documents that my  
aunt, who lived in Baltimore sent me, which is 
an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, 

I received my visa of entry into the United 
States. And in January of 1947, the 19th of 
January 1947, I went to LeHavre in France
 and took the John Erikkson to the United 
State, a 10 days crossing. And I arrived in
 New York on the 29th of January, 1947, which 
is now a little over 51 years. To some people, a 
lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and 
it™s hardly to be believed, that™s 51 years have
 gone by, yes. So I was in France at the end 
of the -- of -- of the war and came to the Un
ited States there. At that point, I didn™t know 
yet what had happened to my  family, although 
the -- the indications were quite ominous 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016

that a tragedy had happened, because we 
knew already what had happened on the camps 
and I knew that my  mo ther -- hadn™t heard since 
‚42. So that was, to me, an indication. 
So I came to United States, I -- I was then s-s
till ignorant of the fact what happened to my 
mother and sisters.  
Q: I™d like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall 

reading something about liberation day and you were in a town in France where they 

were -- German soldiers were being led through town? 

A: Yeah, that™s in the book, also. That is in
 my book, the book will come out at the end of 
this year -- towards the end of the year
 now. Probably Novemb er of 1998 and the book 
will be called, ﬁLeap into Darkness - Seven 
Years on the Run in Wartime Europeﬂ. It™s 
co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, th
e -- actually, he was the -- he motivated 
me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it 

went very well. Taught me a lot and gave me
 an opportunity. But, at the end of the war, 
in Limoge, I was in Limoge. That™s wher e I was when France was liberated. And the 

garrison, the German oc -- the German garri
son in Limoge was not the same as it had 
been before June of 1944, because some of 
them were sent to the war front. The landing 
in Normandy took place on the sixth of June. 
And on the 10th of June was the burning of 

the village of Orodure, to which I was a -- 
almost witness, because I was on my way 
there and got off the train when I saw a Germ
an transport going there and I didn™t want to 
go into the same direction. That village wa
s burned to the ground and all it™s inhabitants, 
except a few, burned with the village. And 
I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away

from them. Everyone that had a ticket for Or
odure, to get off, which I had -- was taken 
into station, was part of that massacre. So 
there again, I was lucky in a great, great way. 
You see, my  escape is not so mu ch survival 
and -- and that™s why I say I don™t exult in it. 
It™s a -- it™s a question of -- of fear and luck. 
The fear is the mo tivater and then you got to 
be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to 
get away. So, that was just -- before the 
liberation, after the liberation, we had these 
-- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in 
-- in Limoge. They were taken down the main street, down towards the station by a 
ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Ge
rmans considered dispensable, just a few 
weeks earlier. And here, this ragtag outfit that
 didn™t have matching shoes, had the nerve. 

Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically
, except their pride and their joy that the -- 
now, the war -- the end of the war came. 
Those Germans acted like little sheep, you 
know. Their -- a few weeks earlier they were th
e masters and at that mo ment they walked 
with their hands on top of their heads and 
looking scared. Why? Because they™re human 
beings. And some of them were young. I m
ean they were in the hands of these 
underground people and they knew that thes
e undergrounds had a bone to pick with 

them. They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in
 their hands, we are not in the hands of -
- of a -- of -- of an enemy™s ha -- high comma
nd, where they have to deal with -- with 
protocol and war amenities. The amenities of 
exchanging and of fair
ness, imprisonment. 
These -- these underground, th-the -- the resist
ance, they were bent on -- on vengeance.  
Q: And you are -- were a memb er of this ragtag [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016

A: I -- I was -- I was not -- I -- I was a member of the -- of the Sixth. The -- the Sixth was 
a group that was engaged in clandestine pe
rformances, like doing false identification 
cards and -- and documents. We did that already,
 before the liberation. But, we were all 
under a -- taking orders. Some were connected
 with the FTPF, they were called. In 
French it™s Front Tereur Partisain Francais
. Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas. 
Partisain -- partisans, you know. They we
re a tough -- oh, how do you say it? Rough, 
rock and tumb le outfit. They didn™t go by -- 
by orders or by command. There was another 
group was called FFI, the Force Francais L™Interi
ore. The French Forces of the Interior. 

They took orders from DeGaulle in London. A
nd there was this conflict between the two 
groups. The one wanted to go the -- the lega
l -- the -- the proper way. The other said, 
ﬁWe™re going to get the enemy whichever way 
we can.ﬂ So this -- this was the group. 
And under -- we were usually under these orde
rs. But the partisans that arrested the 
Germans, they were the ones that had come 
out of the woods carrying their rifles. Some 
of the rifles -- mo st of the rifles were not
 loaded. But the rifle looked good and inspired -- 

if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect.  

Q: Do you rememb er what you were feeling th
at particular day, after -- after so many 
years on the run and so much uncertainty? 

A: Well, it -- it -- it -- it was -- there was elation. There was jubil -- jubilant attitudes, you 

know. In the streets it was festive, carnival-t
ype. And people were rejoicing that -- that -- 
to see that the Germans had been defeated becau
se the atrocities -- in fact, I write that in 
the book, down the street, th-they were -- 
they were carrying placards, ﬁRemember 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
7
 
 
 
 
Orodureﬂ, that™s the town that they burne
d down, you know. Euphoria, that™s the word. 
Wh -- 
Q: Mm-hm. You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself? 

A: Yeah, yeah. The mood was euphoric. And then with it came a sobering mo ment, 

mixed in with that euphoria. That while the 
war is finished, there are families somewhere 
from whom we hadn™t heard. So, to us this 
was the beginning of a new chapter of finding 
out and searching. And being he
re dealing with things. When Paris was liberated, in ‚44 -
- in August ‚44, we knew that Germany was not 
defeated yet. In fact, that same year, in 
the -- in the fall, came the Battle
 of the Bulge. And in that 
counter attack by the Germans, 
they advanced far enough for Paris to feel th
at there might be another -- a re-occupation. 
That never happened. The allies -- allies prev
ailed. But that was that moment. Germans 
were still kicking -- alive and kicking. And 
when the landing took place in ‚44, during 
that period, in June of ‚44, the deportati
ons from southern France, from Vichy, France 
towards Drancy and Auschwitz were still goi
ng on. So even that
 euphoric moo-mood, 
about the landings, had to be tempered with
 -- with the knowledge that people are still 
being sent away. But then when -- when -- 
in 1945, in May of ‚45, the armistice was 
signed, there was a different attitude. Now, 
we knew that the war was ended and we had 
to deal with the aftermath. For many of us, 
that had to do with family, because we had 
left our families and loved ones and some of it 
-- some of them left with their families, 
but in the process of fleeing, of going to Fr
ance and living on the Vichy, some of those 
fa-families had been separated. Young men were hiding out while their parents were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016

deported. That happened quite 
often, you saw that in the movies with -- with ﬁAu revoir 
mes enfantsﬂ and you had so many other things 
and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- 
the wro -- who wrote that book, ﬁWhen Memo ry
 Comesﬂ, he was taken to a convent and 
his parents were deported and never came back
. And finally he got back to his Judaism, 
because he -- he was converted by the padres 
and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a --  not 
to a con -- he went to a monastery, I think.  So anyway, we all had to deal with these 

things and knowing that the war was over was 
very good, but there was the family™s story 
and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from 

emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it wa
s the great uncertainty, who had survived 
and who had not survived.  

Q: And how did you go about beginning to deal with it? 

A: I tried to start searches. Red Cross and 
other venues and did actually not find out until 
1962 what had happened. That was from ‚47 to
 ‚62, 15 years -- what happened to my  
mo ther and sisters, which is also in -- in
 the book. And how I dealt at the mo ment? At 
that mo ment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years ol
d, I had survived the war. I had received 
my papers to come to America. And frankl
y I was looking forward to getting away from 
the continent there. It had not been too kind to
 me, to say the least and of course, France, 
beautiful country. Countries are always beau tiful, it™s what the people do that™s not so 

good, often, you know. But France to me was -- was a country that I wanted already to 

get away from because I had been in jail and 
I had been deported and I had been beaten 
up and so on. I -- I looked forward to coming 
to America, wh-where I knew I had family 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
and start a new life. And that™s what I was 
dealing with. I did not dwell too mu ch on the 
fact that I better stay in Europe and try to
 find my  mo ther and sisters, because I had 
reached out to Red Cross and other agencies a
nd I never heard anything.
 And of course at 
that time, the communication system had 
not developed to the point where you knew 
who had survived, who had not survived. So 
I -- I wanted to be just getting away from 
there and I knew that staying there wouldn™t advance anything from me emotionally, 
because I™d only be still under the -- the impa
ct of what happened to me. And I looked 
forward to make a break. And that™s what ha
ppened. I came to the United States. I did not 
dwell too much on the sentimentality. [indeciphe
rable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and -
- and f -- and fight it to the end, because 
the continent was no longer for me, you see? I 
wanted to get away from it. 

Q: How did you support yourself? You were a 
young man and for those two years before 
you came to America? 

A: Well, we were all -- the American Joint 
Distribution Committee, they were in charge, 
even during the war, with some of the aid that
 they distributed to us. And in Limoge I 
worked for a aid committee, the Co
rshazod committee -- com-com-Committee 
d™Assistance Sociale est Secouron a Reconstruc
tione. A -- a reconstruction of every -- we 
helped people who came back, who were repatriated or people who came out of hiding. 

And to -- to establish themselv
es with -- with ID cards and 
rejoining families. I worked 
for that committee and -- in Limoge and that 
committee was also in charge of distributing 
the Joint Distribution -- the American Join
t Distri -- A -- the -- AJDC -- the JDC, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
American Joint Distribution Committee -- Comm
ittee. They sent funds into Europe and 
they were the arm that exte
nded into the -- into the Jewi
sh community of friends and 
other countries in the -- in the ar
ea, Belgium and Holland, Luxembourg. 
Q: Can you tell me about your -- 
A: And by the way, on that committee, I got 
paid for working there. Nominally, but I 

didn™t need to go to fancy restaurants, you know or something like that. 

Q: Tell me about your -- your trip to America in 1947. 

A: I was in a -- on the Jo -- SS John Erikks
on. I was -- I think about a 37 -- 37,000 ton 
former liberty ship. And it was a -- a January 
voyage. 80 percent of the ship got seasick. 
Most of us, while we were seasick, slept 
on deck, because in the cabins it was too -- the 
smell wasn™t so good. There was -- with the 
disinfectant and so on. I -- it was a -- a -- a 
pleasant ship to be on. It had good food and 
a piano where one F-Frenchman was playing 
swing mu sic. It™s interesting -- was an inte
resting voyage. We were 
seasick and overnight 
the seasickness stopped, because we got into 
calm seas when we passed the Gulf Stream. 
So on the icicles that were hanging on the 
-- on the railing started melting and the waves 

were pretty high, I was one sitting there where 
this fella that played on the piano, he was 
a -- quite an artist. He improvised mu sic 
and arrangements. Arrangements of popular 
tunes, especially American tunes. And th
ere was a young lady, who was a war bride and 
she came to America to rejoin her fiancé. A
nd these two fell in love. And then we landed 
in New York, Hoboken or Brooklyn. Never forg
et that scene. We landed in New York, 
she and that young man walked down the gangpl
ank and her fiancé, the former GI and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
his folk were standing there with flowers to
 wait to -- to  receive her. And this young man 
walked down with her, carrying her suitcase. 
And actually big suitcases were taken in by 
the porters for the customs, but these little 
handbags carrying something for her. And we 
observed that, because we were already aware of
 that, because that was the talk. She says, 
ﬁI don™t know what to tell my  fiancé.ﬂ We were friends on that -- on that ship, you know, 
I have a few pictures that show us together. 
And then they walked down to her fiancé and 
his folks and she says, ﬁI have to tell you that 
I fell in love on this ship and this is the 
man.ﬂ I don™t know what the words were that th
ey exchanged there, but this was one of 
the scenes of that arriving -- arriving in
 America. There was one young lady who said 
she™s going to Eagle Pass, Texas.  A Parisian
 woman. Eagle Pass, Texas, that™s at the 
Mexican border. I mean, this is an outpost 
where you -- where the cows walk in the 
streets and watermelons [indecipherable]. Well, with her I was in correspondence after I 

came here, for a few weeks or a couple months
 or so. And she wrote to me she doesn™t 
know how to deal with that, but from Paris  to Eagle Pass, she never knew that it would 

be this way. And then she -- she devised a 
-- a subterfuge where her mo ther was writing 
her a letter from Paris that the grandmother is ve
ry ill and is about to die. So she told her 
husband, he was her husband already, that she™s going back to Paris, to the funeral of her 

grandmother. Later I found out that she wrote to  him that she is not coming back to Eagle 

Pass. And [indecipherable], these are these spur
 of the mo ment situations where people in 
the war get together, fall in love, don™t know
 what the future will be and then you

12
 
 
 
 
transplant somebody from Paris to Eagle Pa
ss, you™re -- you™re crossing a -- you™re going 
in to -- all together different culture there.  
Q: And -- and what was the future for you? What -- what were your plans? 

A: My plans were to be in -- in -- in Ba
ltimore and start working. To maybe -- you know, 
earn -- earn my  -- my  keep. I had family here. My aunt, my  father™s sister, Aunt Sophie. 

And ma -- Aunt Minna and Uncle Sam, whom I had been with in Luxembourg after I 

escaped from Vienna. They had come here a
nd my  aunt was in the rag business, metal 
and iron, scrap metal and iron, 
but I never expected to be in that business and I came in 
January, lost my  Uncle Sam, whom I loved ve
ry much. I came in the 29th of -- of January 
and in the middle of February he died. I ha
dn™t had much chance to even tell him -- we 
had a chance, but not mu ch chance to communi
cate about these years that had past, in 
between, in the interim. So, but -- end of Febr
uary -- a month after I came here, I worked 
for Barnes Clothing, down on Baltimore Street
 and was my first job and I joined the 

textile company. Some people say I should 
have gone to college and furthered my 
education. Which would have been alright if
 I™d had enough money to pay rent. At first I 

stayed with my relatives, then
 I moved in with a friend of mine. Rented a -- a room in a 
place -- a little apartment. Didn™t want to be a 
burden to my relatives all the time. So -- 
but I worked for a textile firm, starting in 
1947 til the early 60™s. And my goal in America 
was to -- to live a -- a normal life and -- and to make a living, you know. That™s not -- no 

great ambitions or -- or great aspirations ot
her than settle down and -- and quietly. I was a 
good salesman, I turned out to be a pretty good salesman and made a good living 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
working for the textile firm and later did othe
r things. But th -- the first few months in 
America were also not entirely satisfactory 
as far as my  daily life was concerned. 
Numb er one, the death of my  uncle affected me very much. And the change from France 
to America is also a culture shock. Then came 
the very hard winter in -- in -- in ‚47, was 
a hard winter, which is fine, but then the 
very hot summers in Baltimore, which were 
very oppressive for me, I cannot tolerate th
e heat too mu ch. And before you know it, I 
was into the hay fever problem, which I did not 
have in -- in Europe. So the first year in 
America, I had second thoughts and the corres
pondence I had with my  aunt in Paris and 
with some of the friends was that there is 
a possibility I may come 
back. In the back of 
my head, there was also still -- and that I 
couldn™t help -- the idea of my mother and 

sisters. And in America I was far away 
from it, so the combination of not quite 

acclimating immediately to the American cultureand the climate, plus the fact that I was 

still laboring with the thoughts of what had ha
ppened to my family, because this -- there 

was this guilt from the moment that I left th
em, in ‚38, although my mother urged me to 
leave.  

Q: You still had that guilt? 

A: That was with me, yes. So, a combination 
of not quite acclimating and wanting to be 
closer to where I might find out the truth. And still thoughts in me -- I was toying with 

the idea of perhaps going back, if not -- if not to
 stay, but at least to try again, because I 
could have gone back, but I wasn™t -- I wasn
™t a citizen then. So it was a little more 
difficult for me to -- back and forth, but I ha
d to reassess this whole thing. And it didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
take long before I got acquainted with the 
language fully. I had some elementary school 
English knowledge. And I developed a circle 
of friends and once I started working, I 
became more involved in the daily life, acclimat
ed in that respect. The language started to 
come easier and then when I started going on 
the road, I developed more and more of -- 
of a sense of what America means to me, because I like to travel aspect of meeting people 

and -- and earning a living, and -- 

Q: This was your sales [indecipherable] for the textile --    

A: A salesman for the textile company. I 
was -- I became a -- a sales representative for 
them within about ni -- eight, nine months. 

Q: So you got to see the country and -- 

A: County ah -- I traveled the rest of Mary
land and the Eastern Shore and onto Delaware 
and the Baltimore - Washington area. M
ontgomery county, we
stern Maryland. 
Developed a circle of customers, yes. Th
e firm handed me about a list of about 25 
inactive customers. And when I left the 
firm in 1961, I left them with 250 to 300 
customers. So that I had built up, you know. No
r -- I went to Norfolk, Virginia, went to 
the northern -- northern North Carolina area. I 
traveled basically fro
m North Carolina to -
- to Pennsylvania. You know, into --d-different
 days, different directions. But I became -- 
I acclimated fast, yes. 

Q: Did you travel by car? 

A: By car, yeah. 

Q: What kind of car? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
A: Well, my boss sold me his -- that was 19 f -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape One, Side B 
A: Well, my  boss sold me his -- that was 1947 
- ‚48 I bought that. He sold me -- he sold 
me his ‚46 car, Plymouth four door. And two ye
ars later I had to trade it and two years 
later I trade it again and two years later I tr
ade it again, because I put on 50 - 60,000 miles 
a year. So my  first car was a Plymouth, 
1946, a gray Plymouth, 1946, a four door.  
Q: What was it that you were selling, what product? 
A: Textiles. Linens, domestics. Sheets, pillowc
ases, blankets, spreads, curtains, diapers, 
yardgoods, cretonnes, white goods, you know. The 
-- the department stores, five and 10 
stores they are -- five and dime stores, they
™re a little bit out of -- out of -- no longer in 
existence, these places, you know, they™re a
ll big chains now. But you know, I had quite 
a good circle of -- of customers, yeah. 

Q: And your -- your English was 
getting better at this point? 
A: Well, it was getting better, yes. In the be
ginning I had a little difficulty and then as I 
describe in the book, in some of the places 
on the Eastern Shore, some of the merchants 
actually mo cked me. I came into a place, th
e Rising Sun, where I encountered actual 
animosity. That used to be a little bit of Ku 
Klux Klan territory. So, but I -- I could cope 
with that. 

Q: What happened? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
16
 
 
 
 
A: Fact is, I describe it in the book. The -- on 
the Eastern Shore, I was sitting in the hotel, 
adding up my  sales that I had made for the da
y and there were two fellas there, one from 
Philadelphia and one from Brooklyn, both in th
e shoe line. And we started talking and 
they recognized I had a little -- I spoke with 
an accent. ﬁWhere you from?ﬂ And, ﬁYeah, I 
just came here a year and a half ago, two years ago.ﬂ That was maybe in ‚48 - ‚49. But I 

said, ﬁI just started traveling here on the 
Eastern Shore and I find it a little different from 
traveling in Baltimore and Washington.ﬂ They 
say, ﬁHow you mean that?ﬂ I say, ﬁWell, 
the people have sort of a hostile attitude to
wards me, like they™re 
mocking me. When I 
said, ﬁTowel,ﬂ they said, ﬁT
owel? What are you talking about?ﬂ You know, this and that. 
I said, ﬁI feel a little bad about it.ﬂ And th
ey wanted make me feel good and one -- both 
of them said, ﬁDon™t worry about that. I™m
 from Brooklyn and he™s from Philadelphia. 
They don™t like our accents either. So we are -- 
we are in the same boat.ﬂ So it made me 
feel better. 

Q: How did you learn your trade? 

A: Well, it was af -- I -- I worked about eight 
or nine months or 10 months inside the -- 
the office on -- in Baltimore. Anyway, ha -- in 
the -- in -- in the s -- in the wholesaler 
outfit distributorship. People came in and 
bought their merchandise and -- and I learned 

the difference between this type sheet and 
that type sheet. They had types, you know, 
sheets have types. There are -- there are mu s
lins and percales and th
at type 128 and type 
140 and type 180 and type 200. Th
at has to do with how many threads there is in a square 
inch, you know. And qualities and yard goods
 and when you apply yourself, you -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
17
 
 
 
 
learn the -- the -- the details of the trade and th
e -- the boss. He -- he instructed me pretty 
well from time to time and -- then I said, ﬁWell, be good if I could go outside and become 
mo re -- you know, a salesman outside.ﬂ I felt 
there was mo re opportunity in that than 
staying inside and also this way I get to 
learn the country and -- and get to know the 
country and -- [indecipherable] so I worked fo r 13 years for that firm, from ‚47 to ‚60 or 

‚61, yeah. 

Q: And what was it that was appea
ling, did you like the independence? 
A: Yeah, it was independence, it was I coul
d make my  own schedule, basically. I -- I 
decided where I go, what day. Of -- of course
 that is in the beginning, later the schedule 
became more regular. I knew already which da
ys I go to Washington, which days I go 
into other areas, because I knew the schedule 
and the -- the -- the stores, their openings, 
their closing -- closings and -- and became ac
quainted with -- with the owners and some 
of them became not only acquainted, but becam
e friends of mine. And when I came to 

Norfolk, had a few customers there that I hadto always let them know when I™m coming, 

because that night, one of them, they invite me to dinner. Or would take me to his home 

to visit and be with the family. And travel
ed to the Shenendoah Valley, which was a little 

bit reminiscent of the foothills of -- of Vie
nna. I always liked the mountains better than 
the seashore. 

Q: It™s probably no coincidence that you -- you 
had been on the run for so long, that you -
- that you took a job that allowed you 
to continue moving, traveling. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
A: It -- perhaps that was the extension of it,
 that I had this wunderlust in my  -- in my  
veins. That is possible. Well, I was always pe rhaps a little Gypsy at heart in that respect, 
because I remember when I was a kid and I 
was on the railroad station, I would look at 

the trains as they departed and inhale the 
odor of that railroad station. These were the 
steams of the coal and -- and f -- locomotiv
e furnaces. I would -- I would feel quite 
nostalgic, quite nostalgic about th-things like th
is, yeah. I always imagined this train goes 
somewhere and goes into the distance and it™
s winding up somewhere. These tracks begin 
here and will have to end somewhere. This wa
s sort of -- a little bit of romanticism there, 
you know? So, perhaps you are right, that the -- th
e -- the desire to travel was in me -- by 
-- by nature perhaps, by -- by a vicarious thr
ill I got perhaps from that -- you know, to be 
going places and seeing new things
. A friend of mine once said that applies to me, I™m -- 
a friend of mine once said, ﬁYou know, I™m nos -- I am homesick for places that I™ve 

never been to.ﬂ And perh
aps that applies to me. 
Q: You said you made -- you began to make a 
lot of friends. Who were your friends in -- 
in those early years? 

A: Well, here in the area, yeah, in fact a ma
n is coming this evening, we have dinner with 
is -- was one of my first good friends in Ba
ltimore. He™s a retired pharmacist now. And I 
was his best man as his -- at his wedding and 
my wife was a bridesmaid and that™s where 
Flo and I met. So this was one a -- fam
ily and then we met friends in various 

organizations I was involved in -- in some 
-- there was a Zionist group here in Baltimore 
which I -- in which I made many friends. We
 had meetings and -- and then came the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
19
 
 
 
 
establishment of state of Israel in 1948 and wegot together for celebrations and that sort 
of thing. 

Q: Were mo st of your friends Jewish? 

A: The majority, but not exclusively. Had 
some friends that I made in my business 
connections and dealing with customers. 
I know Mrs. Twick, a Catholic woman on 
Linwood Street. We were the best of friends
 when we -- when I called on her and -- and 
exchanging cards. But in my  circle of friends
 here, my -- my family, friends, they were 
mostly Jewish, but as I said, not really excl
usively. And this is still the case today. 
Q: And did you experience any -- you talked a
bout the fear, a little bit of fear that you 
had when you went to the Eastern Shore.
 Did you -- did you experience any overt 
discrimination [indecipherable] 

A: Well, I wouldn™t call it fear on the Eastern Shore, it was uneasiness. I felt set back or -

- or -- or set apart. I wasn™t part of 
my  surroundings. No, I did not encounter anti-
Semitism, but I encountered situations that I didn™t like. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Such as, my  Uncle Sam, before he passe
d away, worked at a -- at a laundry. A major 
laundry, what was the name? Regal -- Regal 
Laundry. And he was in the printing shop 
there. They printed their own laundry tickets
 on stationery and he was in the printing 
shop. Uncle Sam once took me -- it was in thes
e few weeks before he passed away -- we 
were very close. I came down to meet him ther
e, so we can go to have a bite somewhere, 
or whatever. He wanted me to see the place 
where he works, see how it is in America. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
20
 
 
 
 
And as I™m waiting for him to come out of his office, or his workplace, it was five 
o™clock in the afternoon, I needed to go to 
the bathroom. And before I walked into the 
bathroom, I saw outside of the bathroom, two 
sinks -- not in the bathroom, but outside of 

the bathroom, two little sinks against the wall.
 And -- and each sink had a mirror above it. 

And above one mirror it said, Negro, colored a
nd the other said white. So here™s what I 
did. This is the mirror, right. In my  naiveté, 
I stood in front of these mirrors and I did this. 
Q: Back and forth.  

A: Back and forth, I was waving my  body back 
and forth and I tried to see the difference 
in the mirror. Why would this be colored and 
this white? And I wanted to see how this 
reflects in the mirror. At that moment my uncle
 came out. And he says, ﬁLeo, what™s this, 
a new dance you™re doing?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, no, Un
-Uncle Sam,ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m just wondering 
about this,ﬂ -- first time I™d seen it. ﬁOh,ﬂ he 
says. ﬁWell, let me explain this to you.ﬂ And 
he went to explain it to me. To me this wa
s a shock. I had just gone through this thing 
with being Jewish and having to wear the ye
llow star, see? And we were told we are 
different. The Jew, the Nazis say, you can recognize a mile away. The way he acts, the 

way he talks, the way he behaves. He looks
 -- then comes my  question. If we are so 
easily recognizable, why do we need the star? Sc
hool kids, when I talk to them, they have 
the right answers. And here, I wondered -- we
 were separated there by Jewish and -- and 

designated by a star. What designates whom he
re? I -- I couldn™t -- I couldn™t make it out. 
It didn™t make logical sense, it didn™t make 
any kind of human, realistic sense to me. And 
my uncle explained it later, that this is wh
at we are living here and -- and we™re coping 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
21
 
 
 
 
with. ﬁSee, I™m not working together with Ne groes. I am not working to -- we work in 
different building, we eat lunch, we sit in
 different place.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ I said. ﬁAnd that -- 
that,ﬂ I said, ﬁis -- that™s not nice.ﬂ He said
, ﬁWell, don™t talk too mu ch.ﬂ You don™t want 
to talk too mu ch about it, you know, because  you could -- you could encounter resistance 

and maybe he didn™t want me to be hurt, di
dn™t want me to be disappointed. He didn™t 
want me to -- to -- to -- to regard this as 
a place that I may not want to live in, you know, 
after they just brought me over to this country. 
That was one of the things that -- that was 
quite -- it was a shocker to me. And -- 

Q: How did you come to terms with that?  

A: Realized that I have to -- to stay with
 my attitude and opinion that it is wrong. And 
whoever -- whenever anybody will talk to me a
bout it, I will immediately stand up to that 
person and speak back and talk back and sta
nd up. I made up my  mind that if anybody, at 
that time, will tell me something about a ni
gger, which I learned after a few weeks and 
months that this is the word that is not s
upposed to be -- of course some of the black 
people call each other that way, but that is 
the -- to differentiate between me and you. I 
am the good black and you are the nigger. I f
ound that out that that™s discrimination 
among the groups themselves. Jews, blacks, Cat
holics, others. We all human beings. But, 
as soon -- I made up my mind that I will not keep  quiet in the face of adversity or bigotry 

or prejudice, bias. Because I™ve learned my 
lesson in Europe. Because if you keep quiet, 
you prob -- be -- you become a -- a co-conspirator. When you keep quiet you become 

part of -- of the system. If you keep quiet, that
 means in the face of the person that -- that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
-- that mentions these names or says th
ese names or demeans anybody else. If you keep 
quiet, that person walks away in the knowledge  -- or in the -- with the opinion that you 
agree with him. They will never think that 
you might disagree. Oh, he has nothing to say, 
he agrees with me. So I made up my mind,
 if anybody will speak about -- to me about a 
nigger, I will immediately reply to that pe
rson, ﬁYou know what you just did is very 
offensive to me. And I™m not so sure that 
when I turn my  back to you, where you have 
been speaking very nicely to me, I™m not so 
sure that when I turn my  back to you, you 
will not call me a kike. That goes hand in ha
nd.ﬂ And my friend Herbie, that I mentioned 
to you, the one -- Freedman, the one who I -- was one -- one of the first friends. When we 

went down to Broadway and we took a cab hom
e at night after we had taken some girls 
we went out with, friends and -- and date
s and taking them home we grabbed a cab on 
Broadway in Baltimore and asked him to take
 us back to Parkhats Avenue. The cabby 
said to my  friend Herbie, who was perfect in 
English, of course, he went to school here, 
went to the military and everything. So, Herbie
 got the cab and he told him, ﬁGo Parkhats 
Avenue.ﬂ So the fella says to him, ﬁOh, th
at™s Hebetown.ﬂ You know what Herbie said? 
ﬁPull over to the side. Pull over to the side, we
 want to get out of that cab.ﬂ That taught 
me a lesson right then and there, too. That
 Herbie and I, we were on the same page, you 
know. There -- naturally America is -- was a soci
ety that was not in every respect to my  
liking. But on the other hand, I felt also th
at it was a place where I could -- I had no 
longer -- I did no longer have a fear of -- of sa
ying I™m Jewish. See, I have -- I have the -- 
the opportunity to come back in kind if 
somebody says to me, ﬁYou can™t live in my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
area.ﬂ I can say, ﬁYou don™t live in my  area.ﬂ Or -- as bad as it is, but I have a comeback. 
I am -- I am on an equal footing with everybody. 
So I realize that in spite of everything, it 
was still a country that I can acclimate myself to. 

Q: How long did it take you to realize that 
it was safe to say that you were Jewish, 

because it was so unsafe to
 say that in Europe? 
A: You know, when I went here to a syna
gogue and I didn™t see people outside sneering 
or -- or -- I -- I -- I knew that right away. But t ook awhile to -- to realize all that and that I 

was not afraid to -- and that I™m -- to say 
that I™m Jewish, came almost -- within a -- 

within a very short time. Because I had my  
-- my examples there, of my friends. And -- 
and I also knew that there was support for 
me when -- when something might go wrong 
with me, from people who are not Jewish. 

Q: And Herbie was -- was not Jewish? 

A: No, no, Herbie was Jewish. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah, Herbie was Jewish. He s-still is. 

Q: Mr. -- Mr. Bretholz, did you -- I understand you 
-- I believe I read in your memo irs, in 

you epilogue that -- that you didn™t talk a bout your Holocaust experience for a long 

while. Can you talk about why that -- why that
 was and when you did first start talking 
about it? 

A: Well, I didn™t talk for 14 years. It was too 
hard to reflect on it, to come to terms with 
it. And I hadn™t heard anything from my mother
 and sisters and the guilt was there and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
the knowledge that you can™t do mu ch about it,
 was a heavy weight. And I worked, so I 
had my work and I had my friends. In 1960, wh
en I had left Standard Textile and went 
into partnership, into the liquor business, I he
ard a radio program. It was one of those talk 
hosts -- talk show hosts, who -- earlier -- year
s -- that dates back now, over 30 years of 
course. And the man who ran that program, who was the -- the talk show host was a -- a 
Methodist minister by the name of Luther St arnes. We became very good friends. Luther 

had a call-in program and it was at the time when a marine, a young marine died while he 

was exercising in Paris Island with the -- in
 training. And a mo ther called -- a woman 
who may have not been the mo ther of one of 
those marines. And the debate went on, how 
should this training go to toughe
n our boys and to make them into men and make them 
into -- for the defense of the country. Oh, he
re™s the man there. Oh, excuse me. Will -- 
will that disturb you with that?  

Q: Well, a little bit. 

A: This is Mr. Pitt. 

Q: Okay. 

A: So the lady said to Luther Starnes, Luthe
r, if it™s necessary for defense of our country 
to toughen our boys, let™s train them to be kille
rs. Let™s train them to be good soldiers is 
one thing, but let™s train them to be kille
rs, bothered me. So -- so there was the -- the 
break in the -- in the program, during the 
commercial break, I picked up the phone and 
called Luther and I told him what bothere
d me. He says, ﬁYou know what? Let™s have 

lunch together.ﬂ And we had 
lunch a couple days later, whic
h was exactly on the sixth of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
Novemb er. Sixth of Novemb er, 1961, I believe
. ‚60 or ‚61, whatever. And it was on the 
day -- the anniversary of the day that I ha
d escaped from -- from the train and we became 
very good friends and we formed a group, of
 which I was the initiator, basically, with 
him, called Prejudiced Anonymous, lik
e Alcoholics Anonymous, Prejudiced 
Anonymous, based on the premise that when we
™re prejudiced, we have an illness. We 
don™t admit to it. It™s colorless, it™s odorless, you know, it™s tasteless, it™s very insidious, 

but you™re prejudiced. And when you™re prejudi
ced you have to admit that you are before 

you can cure it. Just like an alcoholic. 
So we called it Prejudiced Anonymous and it 
formed -- it turned into a group of over 100 - 150 people -- memb er -- memb ers. And 

then it fell apart because people moved away 
and those who went, we went out to speak 
to groups. Did a lot of programs, got a lot of
 material on that that I still ha-have on hand 
from them -- from then. And that
™s how I started speaking. Because I realized that unless 
I speak up, I -- I will promote wh-what they
 are espousing. Yo-You can™t let the bigots 
get away with their attitudes. And Prejudi
ced Anonymous was that -- I have a plaque 

downstairs on that and everything, this dates b
ack. This is now what™s it, ‚98? This is 37 
years of, whew -- time. Got a little older since then, you know.  

Q: So that™s when you first started talking in public -- 

A: That™s when I first started talking. 

Q: -- to friends and to other people. 

A: Yeah, other people and to meetings. I 
found my  language, I found the way to express 
it and nat -- not to become shy -- gun shy in th
e face of adversity. And when we went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
these groups, we had flak from those 
groups. Why you goody - goody,
 bleeding heart, 
this sort of thing. No. Because if you don™t 
learn the lesson from history, who was that, 
Santanyana said that? If you do not learn the 
lesson from history, we are condemn ed to 
repeat it. And by that -- on that premise, wewent out talking, like we -- we had blacks, 

whites, Christians, Jews, atheists. We had a 
group of people, of -- from all denominations 
and walks of life. And one fella came up with
 a saying -- and -- in those days it was the 
liberty lobby that -- that promulgated the -- th
e -- the -- the -- the slogan, ﬁAmerica, love 

it or leave it.ﬂ Well, this fella was a -- a minister. And he was also a marriage counselor. 

He says, ﬁI can replace that slogan. America, 
love it and change it, for the better. Let™s all 
do it together.ﬂ And then we had one fella 
who spoke -- black fella who actually had 
served some time in jail and 
then joined us because he educated himself. He came up 
with the saying -- I™ll never forget that, pe
ople applauded him. ﬁWe™re getting an A in 
moon, but we™re flunking earth.ﬂ So we -- we
 were a group who became -- we called it a 
group whose time had come. We called ourselv es Prejudiced Anonymous. Patterned after 

the panel of American women. Have you ever heard of that? 

Q: No. 

A: In those days, in the 60™s, there was a 
group of women, who went out to speak to 
organizations and churches 
and synagogues and institutions 
and they had a panel where 
they discussed the aspects of prejudice and 
-- and what can be done about it. And was 
called the panel of American women. So we sa
id, let™s have a panel of fellas, men. The 
women can do their way, they -- they have -- 
they have time during the day perhaps, to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
do their meetings. We are -- because in thos
e days women were not still involved in a 
two -- two family earning pattern and so wome
n stayed home and -- mo re in those days. 
So they had time during the day to go out, in
stead of going in a -- go to a coffee clutch, 
they went to have a meeting in a -- in -- in
 a church or a synagogue or in a school. The 
men were working during the day, so we got 
together in the evenings, or on weekends. I 
never forget -- we went to Washington a s
nowy mo rning. On a weekend [indecipherable] 
to the Omni -- it was I think Omnibus. It was a -- in Washington there was a program 
called Omnibus. We went to Arlington, Virg
inia, a few blocks down from -- from a -- a -- 
Rockwell™s. Rockwell™s headquarters, th
e Nazi Rockwell. In -- on -- on Wilson 
Boulevard. What was his first name? Linc
oln Rockwell. He was the -- the American 
Nazi. They flew the flag th
ere, the Nazi flag on Wilson Boulevard. I once wrote about 
that and said, ﬁOur troops went to Europe to
 -- to get the Nazi flag down from the Eiffel 
Tower, to the Acropolis in Greece and you co me to Arlington and you see a -- you see an 

-- a swastika flying.ﬂ Whether it™s in Arlington,
 Virginia or in Lincoln,  Nebraska, you 
know. Anyway, that was the group that we formed and so I found -- I found my  -- my  

voice. And then in 1962, I got notified by the 
Vienna Jewish community, that the names 
of my  mo ther and sisters do not appear on th
e list of those who have returned. In the 
book I call it quite a euphemism. Instead of sa
ying they were mu rdered at Auschwitz, 
their names are not listed -- do not appear on 
the list of those who have returned. You 
know, that™s a nice way of saying it. But by th
at time I™d found out what happened to my  
mother and sisters and I could begin to reconcile things although the guilt stayed with me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
28
 
 
 
 
for many years until someday later, in fact maybe eight, 10 years ago, I went to a 
psychiatrist and consulted a
nd had a few sessions. And he said to me, you know, ﬁIf your 
mother were able to come back
 for just a moment -- if she 
were coming back for just an 
hour maybe and -- and say one sentence to 
you, she would probably say, ﬁI™m glad I 

urged you to leave.ﬂﬂ Because it was she who ur
ged me to leave Vienna in 1938. She was 
the one. If not for her, I would not maybe have
 gotten my  stuff together and left. B-But 
she says, ﬁYou mu st go because for men, for boys, 
this is not a place to be.ﬂ  See, she was 
very prescient. 

Q: And that -- 
End of Tape One, Side B

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
A: -- this is not a place to be.ﬂ See, she was very prescient. 
Q: And that was the guilt that -- that lingered -- 

A: That lingered with me. The na -- the othe r guilt that lingered with me, to know that 

these people were left in that railroad car. 

Q: The survivor™s guilt. 

A: From the -- from the baby, to the old pe ople, you know. That™s -- that™s described in 

the -- in the chapter of my es cape in the [indecipherable] -- in
 one of the chapters. But th-
the survivors, yeah, that™s -- we are laboring 
under that. All of us, in a way, but I™m not 
dwelling on it. And being that I wrote the book,
 I know I have done what I wanted to do 
to get it -- to -- to get it and -- my friend Mi ke Waleska said to me, ﬁOver so many years 

you™ve written all these Op-Ed pieces and th
e articles th -- in the Sun paper. Put it 
together in -- in reading form.ﬂ And so I sa
y, ﬁI™m not organized, I am not disciplined 
enough.ﬂ He says, ﬁWell, let me help you with 
this. All you have to do is just write your 
narrative. The escape here, the escape there. 
Later we™ll put it together chronologically. 
Give me your narrative on the escapes. A
nd on all the other things that you have 
experienced. And I™ll work with you, edit it he
re, there --ﬂ And in fact, in the book, he 
wrote a lot of the -- the historical aspects to it.
 I wrote about this and that in Vienna, this 
or that in France. And he picked up what happe
ned, historically there, in the war or so, 
you know, with -- so that were cooperative effo
rt. Edit it and helped me and when I wrote 
about 30 - 40 pages on this legal lined paper. Y
ou saw what it is, the -- all block lettering.

He came back with a print out -- computer print out of 135 questions for me. He™s a 
journalist. All right, this -- this is very -- real
 story there, with this lady on crutches in the 
-- in -- in -- in the cattle car. But that lady had 
a face, that lady must have said something, 

mu st have done something. She looked like so
me -- what did she wear? This man that 
was praying there, what was the reaction of
 the other people? And for every -- I had 135 
points to go and elaborate on, rather than 
write a narrative of what happened, go into 
details -- m-more minute details. 

Q: Did all of this help also? Help you come to terms with -- 

A: Yes, come to terms. Because I had to di
g up things and realize that I™m here now to 
tell a story and I cannot let the past be overw
helming me with these emotions when I™ve 
got -- I™ve got a family now and I got a life now and let™s face it by attrition and by the 

passing of time. My mo ther wouldn™t be here
 now anyway, which does not eliminate the 
fact that she was murdered, but 
I have to come to that -- to that realization and I have to 
come to that reconciliation. And I called Mi
chael up like every other night. I say, ﬁYou 
know, I™m -- I™m now on pa -- I™m now on question 18 and this is 135 quest -- and I™ve 

had it already for about two weeks.ﬂ He says
, ﬁI™m not rushing you. You take your time, 
you do -- put your -- put your -- your thoughts in
to it.ﬂ And before you know it, I had 
answered all 135 questions and that was th e book? No, it was not the book, this was the 

book, this was three or four chapters of it.  And then after that my writing came much 

easier, because I already knew what the -- the esse nce of it is, not just that I was in a labor 

camp and worked on th-the so and so, but 
I was surrounded by things and I spoke to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
people and people had reactions. So, I could re
concile it and -- and -- and find this a very 
-- a real catharsis. And when I was finished w
ith it, I felt -- I™d like to do more. I -- I felt a 
letdown. It was good to know that it was fi
nished, but there was a letdown because I 
hadn™t -- I -- I was actually looking forward to
 every new chapter, every new paragraph 
wh-when I was doing it. And I wrote til three, 
four in the morning, because I™m a night 
person. And when I woke up during the night 
and a thought came to me, I went to this 
tab -- this table full with papers. I went to it and I wrote down my  -- mo re notes, you 
know. [indecipherable] 

Q: I think you wrote in your memoirs that 
the war didn™t really end for you until 1962, 
when you got the news about your
 sister and your mo ther.  
A: That™s what I just referred to. That when
 I got this, I had -- there was a -- this was a 
milestone. So I had a -- a closure of some sort. It was the closure to know what had 

happened to them. Not that I had many doubts 
that this was it, but when you don™t have 
the fin -- the -- the official word, you still ha
ve some hope. Because people, after so many 
years, as you™ll read from time to time, get together and find each other. But it was a 

closure. And the only way it can ever be a 
closure is that I do not know where they™re 
buried. That is the -- that is the -- the big 
thing, because mo st people do not realize the 
luxury of -- that they have in knowing the 
burial place of a relative. Father, mo ther, 
uncle, aunt, grandmother. Even if you never go 
to that gravesite, the knowledge that it™s 
there and that you can go if you would want to
, is very comforting. And it is almo st a 
luxury for those who have that comfort, have
 that knowledge. Now, I do -- to me there™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
something like a surrogate for 
that. When I go to the Holocau
st Museum and I see that 
mound of shoes there, I look at it with -- with 
some form of -- devotion of some sort or 
reminiscence or -- what do I want to call it? I l
ook at it with some sort of a solemn  feeling 
that perhaps, perhaps by the f -- most farfe
tched possibility, one of those shoes belonged 
to  my  mo th er o r  my  sisters. S o
 I use that as a reference, as a point of reference to give me 
some comfort and solace. And we have to do 
that. Just like some people go to Auschwitz 
and step on the ground and say perhaps the bones 
and the ashes of my  family are here, so 

I™m here on hallowed ground. To me thos
e shoes mean that. Those comb s and 
toothbrushes there, that are -- you -- you know, there -- at the mu seum. When I™m going 

to that cattle car, I get shivers, you know. A 
cattle car, the way it is constituted there, 
could not have allowed me to escape, becaus
e the bars are bolted to the outside. Solidly 
bolted, I -- I would have never touched them. 
I would have never been able to bend them 
apart like I described doing it at my  -- that point of my  escape. 

Q: How often do you go to the Holocaust Museum? 

A: I go probably mo re often than I would like to and would I -- that I would volunteer to 

go. I was there a day before it officially opened,
 with the WJZ. I have the tape of that, JZ 

TV, they went there to do a -- a program a
nd I -- they took me along to do some color -- 
explanation and get my  i-input. Then ther
e are these bus trips that schools take, 
organization ik -- invite me to come as 
a dossent. So I speak about it on the bus going 

there, what they might expect. I tell them right
 away, this is not a 
trip into serendipity. 
This is not a -- a pleasure excursion. When 
you will come out of there, you will feel tired, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
you will feel abused and you will have a lot of 
questions. And a lot of questions that will 
never be answered. And tell them a little bit a
bout -- what my story, show them my star 
and so on, so forth. Then, on the way back
, sometime there are questions on something 
that they saw and they would like something 
explained or elaborated on. Most of the 
times, it™s silence. The majority of the tr
ips back, I do not get questions, although I say 
right away, when we™re -- if you have any ques
tions during this trip, please don™t hesitate. 
That™s it. I leave it at that. No urging, no 
prodding, no encouraging it. But, very seldom. 
The people are really thinking. And the majo
rity of them, when we leave and we get 
back, say that they will have 
to go back at least one more time, because you can™t really 
absorb it, it™s -- it™s too much. 

Q: Yeah. Can we go back a little bit in time?
 We skipped over the meeting of your wife, 
your future wife. Can you tell that story, 
how you met her and how your marriage came 

to be?  

A: Flora and I met at a wedding. My 
good friend Herbert Freedman married Joyce 
Herman and Flora had a friend who was al
so a friend of Joyce and they became 
bridesmaids to Joyce. Flo™s friend, Sandra, 
bridesmaids to Joyce and I was best man to 
Herbie. That™s how we met. That was in N
ovemb er of 1951 and we were married in July 
of 1952, which will now be 46 years and Herbie 
was best man at my wedding, in ‚52. So 
that™s how I met Flo, in -- at -- at a wedding 
in 1951. I was -- just about four and a half 
years after I had arrived in this country. In ‚
52 we were married, in July and in August of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
34
 
 
 
 
‚52, a month later, I acquired American citizensh
ip, five years after my arrival. And that 
is the -- that is the story of my 
-- of my meeting with -- with Flo. 
Q: Wh-When was the first time you told her 
about what had happened to you during the 
Holocaust? 
A: I did not speak too much about it in the beginning, but little by little it -- it came out, 

because in ‚54 we went to Europe to meet th
e remnant of my family, my aunt in Paris and 
my  cousin in England. And a cousin that ha
d survived who was an 
Austrian, she met us 
in Switzerland. I write about that. And as we
 came to Paris and spoke to my  aunt and -- 
and then my other relatives that were still in
 Belgium since then, my uncle died, my aunt 
died, my  cousin. Time takes it™s toll. And duri
ng that trip to Europe and on the way back, 
I started to tell Flo more and more because sh
e had met the family. But in general, I did 
not elaborate too much on -- on it, because I 
didn™t want to dwell too much on it. Seven 
years ago, when I spoke to Social Secu
rity agency, in Woodlawn, a young lady came up 
to me and she says, ﬁLeo,ﬂ she looked at me
, ﬁLeo, I didn™t know these things.ﬂ I said, 

ﬁWait a minute, wait a minute, you are?ﬂ ﬁI™m Jane.ﬂ ﬁJane, my  God. How time goes by,ﬂ 

I said. It™s a girl I had taken out, dating,
 good friend. And there she was so many years 
later, maybe, I don™t know --  maybe some 30 -- some years later. ﬁBut you know what 

you just -- what I just heard you tell, you never to
ld me about that.ﬂ I said, ﬁJane, in those 
days I didn™t talk about it. I didn™t want to ta lk about it. I didn™t feel like talking about it.ﬂ 

But that was mu ch -- mu ch late
r than -- than when I took Flo to -- when Flo and I went to 
Europe in ‚54. Of course we lived togeth
er and it had to come out, correspondence and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
35
 
 
 
 
pictures and -- and the star, I had the star w
ith me and I told her a few things here and 
there. And Flo was always very, very 
understanding in these things and very 
comp assionate about these things. Much mo re
 than the average person I would think. 
And understood it and -- and -- and even today,
 when she reads about these things or 
hears about this, ﬁHow could that -- how coul
d they do that to -- to the children? How 
could they do that to the old people?ﬂ And sh
e understands it. In fact, one of her first 
friends, girlfriends in -- in Baltimore 
was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had 
survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war, from Sweden. So Flo always 
understood a lot about these things and was 
very understanding and comp assionate and -- 
had strong feelings about it.  

Q: Did she not s -- tell you that -- encourage you 
to confront the -- the past? I read where 
you -- you said something about that. 

A: Yeah, she did. Yeah, she did, it™s a -- 
be good to -- you know, to -- to find out and to 
do the best you can with -- of -- of course wh
en we had children later, I had to be very 
careful with the kids, not to inflict some
 of these post traumatic syndrome aspects on 
them, or pass it on to them, which in 
many families has become a problem. Many 
children of survivors are very actively invol
ved. My kids are not
 so involved, although 
they know of it -- of it, but my  son never wa
nted to hear anything about it and he was 
strongly affected by it. So we had to mode
rate my  memo ries and expression of the 
memo ries with -- with the aspect of -- of 
the family. My -- my  cousin in London -- I™m 
not going to give anything away, but as I didn™
t -- didn™t know there is an ending to this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
36
 
 
 
 
that -- that is a very interesting ending, pe
rtaining to my  cousin in London -- never told 
her kids anything about her family. The kids
 grew up entirely sheltered from it. Now, I 
didn™t shelter them. They -- they knew that 
I had meetings. They knew I had the meeting 
with Prejudiced Anonymous and they knew th
at in Prejudiced Anonymous I spoke about 
my experiences, because I had found my voi
ce. And some of it was reported in the 
papers. A fella by the -- Lou Panos followed us
 from one meeting to the other and always 
described our meetings -- was very impresse
d with what we were doing. But they knew 
about it, because evidently I did speak about 
it at those meetings, because that was the 
essence of what I wanted to tell them. Look 
what prejudice did in Europe and how it can 
affect us all here if we do not -- if we do not
 speak up and talk back and stand up for what 
we think is -- is right. But Flo, yeah, en-enc
ouraged me to -- to a -- to -- didn™t discourage 

me to talk about it, but she was also en
couraging and -- and saying you have to -- you 
have to make up your mind and all that -- how 
to deal with it and deal with it the best 
way you can and you can™t let your life be affect
ed by it for the rest of -- of your years, 
you know, so. 

Q: How many children do you have? 

A: Three. 

Q: And did there come a point where they 
came to you and asked you to talk to them 
mo re about it or did you ever sit down with them? 

A: No. We sat down in a family and sometime it happened at the dinner table, sometime -

- there was never too mu ch reaction from them on -- on an -- on an -- they understood it, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
37
 
 
 
 
but then on emotional point. But -- but my  s
on was definitely affected by it. Whenever 
we spoke about something, about the -- these ev
ents, the Holocaust, he would walk out of 
the room. He could not -- he could not cope with it. 
Q: And how did that affect you? 

A: Well, I-I didn™t -- I tried not to do it when he was -- when he was present, you know. 

Then he went to college and we wa -- we
 moved over to Holland for two years, from 
1975 to ‚77 on business. So I lived in
 -- we lived in Amsterdam, so. 
Q: And they™re grown now [indecipherable] 

A: Oh, they™re grown, yeah. I have four gr
andchildren. The son isn™t married, but the 
daughters are. One lives in Elicott City, one 
lives in Virginia, over in Herndon and we™re 
going there this weekend, to Herndon, Fr
iday and  Saturday to be with her. 
Q: Do your grandchildren know
 about your experiences? 
A: Well, they™re too young.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I have one granddaughter who is nine a nd a half and she knows. She has heard me 

talking in school, Hebrew school, she learns a little
 bit about it. But her sister is six, she 

doesn™t know anything. And then the boys are fi
ve and three, so they™re -- they™re not -- 
Q: Now is -- is Flo American? 

A: B-Born in Baltimore. 

Q: Baltimore. Jewish? 

A: Jewish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
38
 
 
 
 
Q: Okay. And tell me what it was like to beco
me an American citizen, what that was like 
for you? 
A: Well, it was a ve-very -- it was a great experience. I felt very good about it, I felt I 

now have a -- a -- an identity, a passport that 
is respected, that ha -- that -- that is 
meaningful. That™s -- that™s the way I felt 
about it. And you know, I finally got over some 
of the nightmares that I had in the beginning.
 And still, from time to time, I -- I get some 
weird dreams that recall the past, like you know. 
But as -- when I became American, that 
was -- it was a very good feeling for me. I was some -- it was something -- it was a 

feeling of achievement. And proudl
y when we went to Europe in ‚54, I then traveled on a 
-- with an American passport and -- and I didn™t have to -- and another thing, in -- well, in 

school for instance, in Austria, we had on 
our -- on our certif -- on our reports, yearly 
reports, was not only our name, but also our re
ligion was marked. And this in -- in -- in 
America, I didn™t feel -- felt was no longer the venue, you know, yeah. 

Q: What did it mean to be an American, to you? 

A: Well, when you -- when you become -- wh
en you become an American citizen, you 
feel that something special has happened to
 you. You have become a person within a 
system that considers you a person. On pa r with everybody else. And what it meant was 

exactly what the judge told us. You -- mo st
 of you -- all of you -- these were Russians 
and Poles and Czechs and Romanians and It
alians. Most of you come from countries 
where when you walked into a room, or a sc
hoolroom, or an office, you had the picture 
of the leader of the country. We don™t have this
 idolization of a -- of a -- of a person. The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
39
 
 
 
 
president lives in the White House and he is  your tenant. Never forget the judge said. 
And when it™s time to evict him, you doing it.  He gave us the metaphor, you know. He is 

your tenant. And you come from all backgrounds
, from all areas of the world and you™re 

just a continuation of that influx that came he
re at the turn of th
e century. Unfortunately, 
latel-lately these attitudes have changed, fo
rgetting that what Emma -- what what™s her 
name said, [indecipherable] Emma Lazarus sa
id on the Statue of Liberty, both foreign 
born and native born have made this country 
great. Go through the history of America 

and you see how many of -- of the -- of the pi
oneers, what they have done for America. 
So I rememb er what the judge said, and that
 always stuck with me. You come from many 
areas, but here nobody will malign you because 
you come from here, from there, because 
we are all alike. We are all -- we all came basically on the same boat, at different times. I 

did and you did and your neighbor
s did. The judge made a great impact on me and I felt 
very good about becoming an American. And 
I don™t wear the flag on my  sleeve, but 

when I lived in Holland, I did, because 
in Holland, oh, you Americans, you -- you don™t 
know from tragedy and pain and bombing. Wh
at do you understand about the miseries of 

the Dutch, you know. In the meantime, they 
segregate the Moloccan
s and the Moroccans 
and the Turks. But they harp on the black ma
n here. And I said, ﬁYou just come and talk 
to the black American and see whether he woul
d prefer to live in your country or whether 
he would prefer to stay in America.ﬂ And th
at™s when I had to defend America. And they 
said, you do not understand what it means to be
 suffering. Because they had just gone 
through that World War Two thing and the N
azis and persecutions and hardships and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
hunger. Famine and all this thing. Depor
tations, bombings, from which I am to 
understand by what they say, and they sa
y you do not understand me
 and you have never 
had that, therefore you can™t understand. But 
we, because we had it, we have become 
better for it. We understand what it is a
nd when you understand something, you apply it 
in your life and you become better for it. But 
that isn™t the case. So I said, ﬁHave you 
become better for it? Look at the Moloccans. 
A cab driver wouldn™t pick him up to take 
him to his apartment, because he says he is
 going to Battonfeld and 
Battonfeld is one of 
the suburbs where the Moloccans live, or the Moroccans. So 
the cab driver would say I 
can™t take you. This is -- have you become be
tter?ﬂ And this is the arguments that I had 
with them, you know? That™s where I stood up for America. And I was proud to do that. I 

said to Flo, ﬁNow, let™s get back to Americ
a and relax. Now we are Americans, we know 
what™s good about it, we know wh at™s bad about it and we know 
what we want to change 

and we know what we can™t change. And we
 know that it will always be the same, 
basically, f -- because people are people.ﬂ Bu
t the times have evolutioned, you know. But 
in Holland, we had to stand up for America. It
 made me feel good. It made me feel real 
good when I went to the consulate in -- in
 1976 and I voted. I voted in absentia.  
Q: You talk about having nightmares. How 
long -- what were the nightmares about, how 
long did you have them? 

A: They were sporadic. One of them that 
I describe in the book is mainly -- I™m coming 
into a h-house that is being destroyed, torn
 down. And there is a wall and the wall is 
being hit with these ac -- picks, you know they
 -- that they tear down from the inside. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
And in it, behind the wall, is the body of a woman. It™s a recurring theme. And also, I™m 
walking in the street and I™m coming to a ba
rrier, almost like a construction type barrier, 
but instead of construction, beyond are Nazi 
brown shirts. I™ve had that sporadically, on 
and off. But not recently. This was in the 60™
s. 50™s - 60™s - 70™s, up to the 70™s, not 
recently. From time to time I do dream about sw
imming a river or talking to my mother, 
my  sisters. And th-that -- that would some
time be a reflection on what we might have 
talked about the night before at dinner, or
 maybe -- you know, I never bring the subject 
up. When we are at dinner, unless somebody will say, ﬁSo how are you coming with your 

book?ﬂ I [indecipherable] fine, yeah. ﬁWhat do you -- h-how was this? Did you hear 

about what so and so said? You hear about Sw
itzerland, whats --ﬂ I sit in a restaurant. I 
walk into a restaurant and I see somebody sta
nd in line there in front of me, or somebody 
is just walking out. I know the person. He ru
sh -- or her -- they walk over, ﬁHi, how are 
you doing, Leo?ﬂ And I™ll mo tion to Flo, watch this. ﬁYou know Leo, I meant to call you 

and ask you, you know I read something about
 the Holocaust Mu --ﬂ I -- immediately 
when they see me, they -- they
 think I am the authority on the Holo -- I don™t want to be 
an authority on the Holocaust. I don™t want to be
 -- I want to be Leo Bretholz. I -- in nine 
out of 10 cases, they™ll come and ask me so
mething about the Holocaust. When are you 
going the next time? Do you know a bus that™ll go there, because I like to go alone. Do 

you know my  son --

A: ﬁWhen are you going the next time? Do you know
 a bus that™ll go there, because I like 
to go alone. Do you know my  son or my  nephe
w, they have a project in school, they 
would talk to -- like to talk to someone. Y
ou think he can give you a call?ﬂ ﬁYeah, ask 
him to give me a call. Yeah, do that.ﬂ Some 
of them call, some of them don™t. But it™s 
nine out of 10 cases when somebody sees me in
 a -- in a -- in a place, the subject will be 
the Holocaust. I don™t -- I don™t relish it. I don™t e xult in that th -- sort of thing. Because 
it™s -- it™s part of me, it™s my  past, that™s -- yes, but I don™t go to a fella who is a -- a 

shoemaker and say, ﬁYou know what? I meant 
to tell you, I -- I bought a pair of shoes 
and --ﬂ wh-wh-wh -- I give you that as a -- 
as an example. I don™t go to anybody who is a 
doctor and would say, ﬁYou know, I meant to ca
ll you. I had a pain here that -- what do 
you make of that?ﬂ  

Q: You™re more than the Holocaust. 

A: I™m mo re than the Holocaust. I don™t want to
 be an -- oh, I™m sorry, I don™t want to be 
an object of curiosity. I -- he™s a survivo
r, you know. ﬁThis is my  friend, Leo, he™s a 
survivor.ﬂ You know, spare me. Spare me the 
title, please, sir. We are all survivors. Do 
you realize that if Hitler had won that war 
and become what he wanted to be, the 
thousands [indecipherable] encompassing the 
whole world, that we wouldn™t be sitting 
here, talking? In that re -- in that -- in that
 way, we are all survivors. Don™t think of the 
others as survivor, please, do me 
a favor. [inaudible]. Do you understand? 
Q: Sure. 

A: Can you personally understand it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
Q: Sure. 
A: Aside from this being an interview, if 
you and I were talking over a cup of coffee, I 
would not bring up the subject, but if you w
ould bring it up, I would certainly tell you 
what you want to know. That™s common courtesy and common procedure when 

somebody wants to find out something in the 
process that -- that could be possibly a 
learning a process, yes. But this is not my  
achievement. My achievement is that I am 
alive. Let™s dwell on something positive. I ha
ve a family and these are the -- the new 
branches of the old tree, you know, it™s --  

Q: Well, let™s pick up on some of the more positive achievements, then. I think we left 

off in your career with you starting a -- a liquor business. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit about -- more about your work and how that -- 

A: Well, the -- the work in the liquor busine
ss was a very lucrative business. It was good, 
it was from 1960 -- ‚61 -- ‚60 - ‚61 to 1968 and th
en came the riots and we could not get 
insurance any more, so we sold it. We
 sold the property and the business. 
Q: The riots -- the civil rights? 

A: Civil rights, yeah. And this is an aspect 
that I want to bring out and was thinking of 
bringing out if it came up. That while the liquor
 stores were closed for two weeks curfew, 
by edict -- 

Q: And this is in Baltimore? 

A: Baltimore. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Every night, around -- between 11 and 12 mi
dnight, we got calls from the area of 
people that were standing there, watching, 
assuring us, ﬁLeo -- Mr. Leo,ﬂ Mr. Bender was 

my partner. ﬁYour place is okay. We will not 
let anything happen to it.ﬂ We felt that was 
a tribute to us by the people there, who 
knew who we were, who knew how we treated 
our customers. This is where my  actions, my
 words -- my words and our meetings with 
Prejudiced Anonymous, showed some results, in 
fact. That it wasn™t just that we spoke 
words, but that we acted it out in our daily  lives in our business. Stores were burned 

down on Lomb ard Street and this corner liquor
 store at Lomb ard and Central, remained 
intact -- where others lost their businesse
s. Now naturally we couldn™t stay there -- 
without insurance you can™t run a liquor store. 
And we sold the property later to someone 

else and that was fine. So that was the liquor
 store. And that was til 1968 and I went into 
a -- into the book business in partnership. And 
my partner had the place in --  my partner 
had the place in Amsterdam, a book place in -- w
ith another fella, in partnership and this 
fella wanted to come back to 
America, so I went over to manage that store for two years. 
Took my  wife and my  two daughters. My s
on was at Georgetown University and he 
finished his study. Took my  two daughters ove
r there. One went to the international 
school, the younger one. The older one went to an
 extension of Syracuse University in 
Amsterdam. She had just a -- about a -- had a ha
lf a year left here in high school. And did 

her tests with a proctor and came back in ‚76 
to graduate on -- on the stage, with the kids, 
then we went back. And -- and when I came 
back -- when I came back from Amsterdam, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
45
 
 
 
 
I just went to work for my  former partne
r -- also managing his store -- also book stores. 
And then in 1992, I retired from the book busine
ss. I was in the liquor store business and 
the book business. And at first a traveling sale
sman for a -- a textile 
company. So that -- 
that is basically no great -- no great shakes, but I always made a living and then -- then I 
wrote this book. 

Q: How -- how do you think your experiences 
during the Holocaust shaped your belief 
system, or -- 

A: Well, the belief system is a -- is a very -- 
is a very -- I was raised, actually, by a quite 
liberal father. He -- my father was never raised
 -- he died when I -- when I was nine, so I 
wasn™t really raised by him. But he was neve
r a religious man, but he was a very activist 
man in social causes. And the Ho
locaust shaped me to  the extent that there is a realization 
that unless you assert yourself in the face
 of hatred and adversity, you will -- you will 
become a victim eventually. Now, you have
 to stand up for what™s right when your 
neighbor is being maligned, and your fellow man discriminate
d against. That™s the way 
we raised our kids. Because if you don™t do it 
at that moment, then
 it™ll come back to 
haunt you because there™s somebody there waiti
ng for you -- to -- to malign you. And the 

-- the evil of -- of prejudice and hatred, has to  be recognized for what it is. That™s the 

lesson of the Holocaust. If, from that negative 
experience of the Holocaust, there is only 
one positive thing that come out of it, it™s the creation of an awareness that it can happen, 

so that you can fight it. Now,  you have to
 fight it before it establishes itself as a 
governmental entity. Before the government has 
been established with that ideology. You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
cannot let it get to the point where it becomes 
officially a government  policy, then it™s 
too late already. [telephone interruption] 
-- we shouldn™t. So fight it before it is 
established, because then it is too late. Th
e Nazis have shown it to us. Other -- other 
dictatorial regimes have shown it to us. The -- the -- it -- it™s like a web. The dictator is 
like a web -- in a spider in a web, I mean. 
The dictator™s the spider. Now, this is 
metaphor, again. The spider gets that insect 
and enmeshes it in the 
web. But the spider 
isn™t finished. He goes for more victims. He 
gets more, until this web is filled up with -- 
with insects, then he builds another web to ca
tch mo re, you see? That -- that is -- that is 
what we have to learn from it, to fight wh
en you see it. Now, can we always do it? Do 
our -- d-does our -- our character, our -- our te
mperament always allow us to immediately 
speak back -- or talk back
, I mean? Sometime not, sometime you have to say, well, you 
have to watch out, maybe that person didn™t 
mean it, you have to make allowances. But 
we cannot make many allowances. When there is
 a pattern that repeats itself. Whether it™s 
in the school, or at work, you have to speak 
back. [indecipherable] can™t talk. You have 
to talk back. And when people tell me, ﬁLeo
, why did other people 
not run? Why did you 
run?ﬂ I say, ﬁI was afraid, I was scared.ﬂ Fe
ar was my motivater. Then I have to give 
examples. It™s easy to say, why does somebody 
not run. Well, I ran, I was free, I was 
single. If I had been with a family, I couldn™
t have done it. If I -- one elderly person, I 

couldn™t -- a woman, a child. And in the whol
e history of deportations from France, there 
were less than a dozen attemp ts to escape,
 out of 80,000 - 85,000 people. Book shows it. 
But -- but when somebody says, ﬁWhy did others
 not run?ﬂ Almo st like demeaning them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
for not having attemp ted. I have one simp le 
example to these people. You™re working in 
an office, you™re working in a factory, in
 a business. And you have a supervisor, you 
have a manager, you have a foreman, you ha ve a boss and you come home day after day 
after day and you™re comp laining to your 
husband or to your wife, ﬁHe goes on my  

nerve.ﬂ Or, ﬁShe annoys me. I can™t stand it, 
I hate to go into -- I hate the thought of 
going into that office.ﬂ There™s nobody standi
ng there with a gun. You can quit. All you 
are giving up is a job and you have to find 
another job. But nobody™s standing there with 

a gun, threatening you and you sa
y people should run away when they are in line, being 
assemb led to be taken into a train, surr
ounded by guards with weapons? They should run 
away, but you can™t get away from a job wher
e there™s nobody there with a weapon? It™s 
always so easy for someone else to tell othe
rs what they should have done, when they 
themselves don™t know what they would have done.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And you have to understand also the other pe
rson that is being prejudiced against. As 
I said before, the nigger in the pr -- in -- in 
-- in the hater™s eye, b
ecomes the kike or the 
wasp or the wop. 

Q: You talked about the lesson of the Holocau st and I wanted to read you this quote from 

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of 
Israel. You may have heard of -- heard him 
or read his -- this, from April 24th. ﬁThis is
 the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only 
this. That the existence of the Jewish people 
is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish 
army  that rests on the strength of Je
wish faith.ﬂ Do you agree with that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
Q: Well, after the Holocaust, we have seen
 that nationhood for the -- for the Jews was a 
survival necessity. Had there not been a Holo
caust, there probably would not have been a 
Jewish state. But had there been a Jewish st
ate in the 30™s and 40™s, I am convinced that 
there would not have been a Holocaust. All 
you have to see is Entebbe. Absolutely. That 
-- that is my conviction, because we lost 
a million and a half children. A million and a 
half children. As somebody wrote -- a woman 
wrote, Gerta Weissman Klein wrote that 
they™re ordinary children, but a lot of them
 could have become very extraordinary. 
Luxembourg is a nation with
 350,000 people or 400,000 peopl
e. There were a million 
and a half children who could have growninto a nation of 30 or 40,000,000, had they 

been allowed to live, but they didn™t. Had 
there been a state of Israel, these children 
would not have died. In that respect, yes.
 With other things, I can disagree with 
Netanyahu, but he was elected. And perhaps the -- the labor government is mo re 

acceptable to a lot of people, because they 
were, perhaps, more 
-- more amenable. But 
Rabine also was not a man who was going to ha
ve his country commit suicide. I am sure 
he was not that kind of a man. In fact, Ra
bine was a general and Netanyahu was not. But 
Netanyahu is also a man who wrote an importa
nt book about terrorism, he is an expert on 

that.  

Q: You said something interesting, had ther
e not been a Holocaust, there would not have 
been a Jewish state, and -- and made me 
wonder, had there not been a Holocaust, how 

would your life have been different? Do you ever reflect on that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
49
 
 
 
 
A: Well, had there not been a Holocaust, pe
rhaps I would never have come to America, 
that is possible. But the Jewish state was alr
eady in the stages of -- of -- of planning, or 
infancy or a incubation with the Balfour D
eclaration, 1917. Of course, in 1895, Hertzel 
wrote The Judenstat, a Jewish state, whic
h he became aware of through the Dreyfuss 
affair. And he said, if we will it will not be a -- if we will it, it will not be a dream. But, 
while it was in -- in it™s infanc
y, then the -- the -- the idea, 
it -- it became -- it became a -- 
a dire necessity after the Holo caust, simp ly because -- because the proof was there, that 

nobody -- nobody was accepting the Jews. The world knew about it. The -- the ship Saint 

Louis came to the American coast in 1939 a
nd Gustov Shroeder, the captain with the 
swastika on his lapel, called the Coast Guard, 
ship to shore, pleading with them, ﬁLet -- 
don™t let me take these people back.ﬂ He was crying, a Nazi. Was he a Nazi or was he a -- 

a -- a cripto antagonist, perhaps, you know. Bu
t he wore the swastika and he was the 
captain of the ship, from the Hamburg - Ameri
ca line. And he™s, ﬁDon™t let me take these 
people back.ﬂ And those who wound up in Engl
and were saved, but the ones that depo -- 
disemb arked in Holland and in France and in
 Belgium, they wound up in the -- in the 
death camps. So the captain -- Nazi captain wa
s right. And when you take that in history -
- in the context of history, you -- you -- you w
ill see that -- that™s conjecture, naturally. 
But the impetus was there for the state and th
e -- and the sympathy was there for the state 
and it -- and it became. And today there are 
problems. There are problems within that 
state. We know them and we hope they will overcome them.

Q: A couple of things that I didn™t ask 
you about, in -- in talking the -- about the 
chronology of your life and that is your trips to
 Europe -- going back to Europe in the -- 
late ‚54 and then later. Can you talk about
 what impressions those trips had on you? 
Q: Well, I told you the impression that I had 
when we lived in Holla
nd, with the Dutch, 
that I had to stand up -- I had to drape my se
lf in the American flag, because I was an 
American. We came back in ‚54 and then we we
nt to England in ‚54 to meet my  cousin. I 
learned a lot from her, what happened to her 
during the war, she was in a -- in a -- lived 
in a building that was bombed in the blitz a nd she narrowly escaped. I also learned that 
during the blitz, when the people went into
 the shelters, in the underground, metro, 
shelters. That where they may have been at odds with each other, racially or in -- n-n -- 

by na -- racially or by nation or by religi
on or whatever. Where the -- whether West 
Indians in England or where some of the As
ians in England were perhaps second class 
citizens, but when it came to going into the 
bomb shelters, they all slept under the same 
blankets. They all were together, threatened
 by that one common enemy. So it just shows 
how some situations can make human beings 
into real human beings, not just a species, 
but in action, you see? That™s what we learne
d at -- that was during the war -- in the war. 
We -- we -- we went back to France in ‚54, 
to meet with my aunt and with relatives in 
Belgium and my cousin from Vienna came to join  us in -- in -- in -- in Switzerland. Very 

little -- very little was mentioned about the trag
edy of the war, it was too fresh. Much too 
fresh for my cousin in -- in Vienna, who ha
d lost her father. This is described very 
vividly. My aunt in Paris who had lost he
r husband. My uncle in -- in Belgium, whose 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
son was deported and mu rdered at Auschwitz. 
So these were things that were tacit -- 
tacitly part of our -- of our make up, but 
it wasn™t much talked about. 1970 -- in 1970, we 
went to Israel to visit our family on the 
kibbutz there, my  mo ther™s youngest brother was 
there. It™s interesting. He was there and we
 went to visit him with the family on the 
kibbutz. He is no longer alive now. And we we
nt back to Europe and traveled by car 
through Europe. Again met with my  aunt in Pa
ris and my  cousin in Vienna and I just 
mentioned my  family on the kibbutz lately. We 
received this picture from them. This is 
my  Aunt Sarah here, who was 90 and on her 90th 
birthday, this is the clan. These are her 
daughter and two sons, their children, grandchildren and her by that -- by that measure, 
great-grandchildren. What does this picture 
signify? That one man, Uncle Jacob, my  
mo ther™s youngest brother, left Europe in 
1930. One person, of one family, in 1930 and 
this is -- this is the result of one man™s 
leaving Europe and not 
having to go through the 
Holocaust. This is the result. Can you extend it in
to -- into mo re people, if of our family, 
another five or six or 10? My father was one
 of nine and my  mo ther was one of 10. If 
they had possibly had the foresight to go th
at -- at that time my Uncle Jacob was a 
pioneer. He was an idealist. He went to
 a kibbutz as a farming, you know, this was 
idealism. And -- and so he went there by 
conviction. Although, he knew what he was 
running away from, because Poland had had pogr
oms, he had lived through some of the 
pogroms in his hometown.  

Q: Wh-What was it like going to your hometown in Vienna, going back? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
A: Traumatic, the first time. 1970, very trauma
tic, couldn™t wait to leave. I was in Vienna 
for one week. As I describe it in the book, I fe
lt that I was -- when I left Vienna, I felt I 
was leaving a cemetery. See, the hills were ther e, the buildings were there, the trees were 
there, but the heart and soul was gone and a ll those who could have made a difference, 

namely people and faces and arms clutchi
ng you -- that was not there. So you -- so you 
had a -- a very traumatic -- I went back in -- 
that was 1970. I went back in ‚92, that was 
already different and I went back in ‚96 to
 Vienna, that was almost -- well, almost 
reconciled. And Flo enjoyed it very mu chin 1996 also, when we were invited by the 

Vienna government to come. [indecipherable] we
lcome service. This is a sort of a make 
up to us, you know, in a way. But it was very en
joyable, in a way, that I went back to 
some of the places, took some photos. And Fl
o keeps saying, ﬁYou know, I would like to 

go back to Vienna.ﬂ And I -- I would go -- I w
ould go back, in fact I -- I have a cousin 
who still lives there. She™s about my age, 
about a year younger. But will we or won™t we, 
I don™t know. I believe we will. I would like to
 retrace my steps in France, where I -- 
mainly -- which is mainly th e -- the -- the locale of -- of the book and I maybe -- maybe I 

get some interviews on -- on the -- on some of
 the radio shows and I can really promote 
it. I would like the schools to get that book. That was -- would be my  major -- it™s not -- 

this is not what you might call a -- a mone
y-maker. The book will sell for 16.95, a hard 

back. And they™re working on the layout now, w
ith all im -- with all the -- the cover and 
so on, so forth. But, I would like it to be ac
cepted in -- in schools as a -- as a learning text 
and also as an encouragement to some of 
the young people, not to give up when things go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
badly and stick to it. Because I -- in the face 
of adversity, I -- I did not give up and I think 
escaping from a train is probably a -- a great 
form of resistance. And there™s not many 
that did that. Because we were going to hell, 
straight to hell. So that was 19 -- I said 1970 
- 1992 -1996, we went back. And I would like to
, as I said, go back again. If you want to 
know any mo re details about -- there was not mu ch there. I -- I roamed through the 
streets of Vienna, went back to the syna
gogue, which was no longer there, where I was 
Bar Mitzvahed. This is now an apartm
ent building and it has a plaque outside, 
designating it as a scene of a conflagration,
 destroyed by the Nazi hordes. It™s an 
apartment building. So I™m watching this a
nd I™m reading this and a lady coming out of 
the house, this building, she sees us and sh
e says, ﬁCan I help you in any way? Looking 
for anything?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, this is the place th
at I went to say my pr
ayers when I lived in 
this area.ﬂ ﬁOh, oh.ﬂ And she walked away, becau se she™s now a tenant in that place. And 

then steps back for one mo ment and she sa
ys, ﬁI want you to know, we are living on a 
holy ground here.ﬂ So she admitted that to hersel
f, that this used to be a synagogue and to 
her, her apartment building is -- has 
been erected on holy ground, you know. The 
Austrians are 99.9 Catholics. And I kne
w -- probably knew just as mu ch about 
Catholicism when I lived in Austria as I kne
w about my  own religion. But that™s what it 

was, that was the reaction there. Others we
re nice and -- and forthcoming. There were 
other people who were standoffish and didn™t want to hear about it. And in 1970 -- that 

was ‚96, I™m there talking about, but in 1970 wh
en we were there first, I walked into a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
54
 
 
 
 
store to buy stamps and I said, ﬁHow mu ch 
are stamps for America?ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ she said, 
ﬁyou™re American?ﬂ I says -- 
End of Tape Two, Side B

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
A: I walked into a store to buy stamps and 
I said, ﬁHow mu ch are stamps for America?ﬂ 
ﬁOh,ﬂ she said, ﬁyou™re American?ﬂ I says, ﬁY
es, but I was born in Vienna.ﬂ And I said 
that to her in German. I have a cousin w
ho wouldn™t want to honor them with German, 
she™s so upset, she™s -- she will never talk Ge
rman. But I talked in German, ﬁYeah, but I 
was born in Vienna. I™m from America, but 
I was born in Vienna.ﬂ ﬁWell, so not 
everybody did get killed, that™s -- that™s fort
unate.ﬂ Then she added that™s fortunate, you 
know. I mean, she didn™t have to say not 
everybody got killed. I should have ask her, 
ﬁHow many really survived?ﬂ And if we surv
ived, it wasn™t due to your efforts. It was 
due to my  effort. Cause if you had it your
 way, we would not have survived.  
Q: How do you think your efforts of -- of
 doing what you had to do, you know, using 
your wits, using fear, using whatever mo tiva
ting factor you had during the war to -- to 
survive. How -- how did it make you what you are or how did you -- how did it shape 
you and what impact did it have on your -- on the rest of your life? 

A: Well, my wife will tell you that when I hi
 -- when I am on the road in the car and I 
hear a siren in the back of me
, I think they™re after me. And I™m also not one to give up, 
even in present life. When I™m looking for 
something, when I™m on the road looking for 
something. When I™m trying to find somethi
ng in the house, when I™m trying to -- to 
correct something. I™m not one to give up 
easily. I s -- I -- I stick to it. You lose 
something, I -- I -- I -- I trace back the step
s that I™ve been to. I go and look again and 
look again. My wife would misplace some
thing, I would say, ﬁWell why don™t you look 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
56
 
 
 
 
here?ﬂ ﬁNo, I looked there.ﬂ ﬁWhy don™t you 
look again?ﬂ And then she says, ﬁWould 
you believe it? I™m glad you told me, I found 
it here now.ﬂ And -- and the same thing 
with my  kids sometime and I -- I -- I -- I just
 don™t give up too easily. And in fact, when 
we had escaped from the train, I told my  friend, ﬁYou know, 30 years from now -- 30 
years from now -- we will be talking about th
is like it™s a dream.ﬂ He says, ﬁHow can you 
think of 30 years from now?ﬂ he said. ﬁY
ou don™t even know what™s going to happen 
three hours from now. We have no papers, we
 have no --ﬂ I said, ﬁYou know, now that 
we have escaped from that train, I don™t th
ink anything will prevent me from surviving 
the war.ﬂ Because that situati
on was such an extreme situation that I think I will never be 
presented with another situation that could be that extreme. And I made all the efforts 

possible, never to get back to Drancy again.
 That™s where I escape from another train, 
you know. This -- I -- I -- a couple of train escap
es. You saw that, probably, in my  write 
up of the -- 

Q: Yeah, I was going to say you™re -- you -- you call yourself the ghost of Auschwitz, I 

was going to say the Holocaust Houdini. 

A: Maybe something like that. Maybe. Some 
people say that, too. Yes, I had several 
escapes. I had a escape from the gendarmes afte
r my  trial, they caught me back. Caught 
me like -- to -- after a couple days and I served
 two days extra in jail for that. Was added 
to my  sentence, you know.  

Q: Are there other sounds or smells that re
mind you? You said the sirens sometimes get 
you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
A: Well, farm smells, yes. When I™m going to
 the farms. When we used to go on trips 
through the farm, in the country with the 
kids, and the open window, the odor came in 
from the -- manure odor. Th-Th-Th-The smell of
 stables -- smell of stables was very 
reminiscent to me, because I spent one night 
-- the second night after my escape, sleeping 
between two cows that were chewing their cud.
 And that is a very reminiscing feeling to 
me.  
Q: I think you describe it as a perfume, cows [indecipherable] 

A: Where did you -- did you [inaudible] 

Q: I think that™s in your memo irs, no? 

A: I-Is it in the -- in the memoirs or is it pe
rhaps in -- did you listen to my interview with 
the -- 

Q: Maybe that was [indecipherable] 

A: -- the transcript of the interview -- 

Q: That might have been it. 

A: -- that I did with Linda -- Linda Cosmac. Dr. Cosmac, yeah.  

Q: Mm-hm, might have been. 

A: Hold it for a second -- 

Q: Sure. 

A: Let me show you something. Read this 
book about Vienna and I told you before about 
this lady in Vienna. You know how they can 
be very charming and so, but then they 
come with that big -- there was a playwright
 in Vienna, by name of Nestroy -- N-e-s-t-r-

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
58
 
 
 
 
o-y. Nestroy wrote satirical plays. And he always poked fun, as well as of himself -- o-of 
other people, also of him -- of himself. He 
poked fun and in this little chapter, in this 
book about Vienna. It™s called, ﬁVienna, my  Vi
enna.ﬂ ﬁIn his masterpiece, Judith and 

Holofs -- Holofernese, Nestroy attackedﬂ -- he
 always attacked people, see -- ﬁattacked 

another cherished Viennese institution, anti-
Semitism. By the brilliant device,ﬂ that -- 
that™s where he was so brilliant with -- ﬁof 
disguising Viennese char
acters as Jews and 
holding the Jews up for laughter while actually
 exposing the Viennese for their weakness 
and meanness, their outward charm and lack 
of inner conviction.ﬂ In the 1850™s, very 
funny plays, we used -- when we were kids 
we used to go to Nestroy™s plays, you know. 
He -- he had a play that was called 
-- the vaschwenda, ﬁThe Spendthriftﬂ. 

Q: How -- how do you think your -- your wa
rtime experience has affected your 
spirituality? 

A: You mean religiously? 

Q: Religiously. 

A: I was always traditionally very mu ch invol
ved with -- with Judaism, but I was never a 
-- practicing in the Orthodox way, although I re
late mo re to the Orthodox mood, because 
that™s the synagogue I went to in Vienna, th
an to the Conservative or the -- the Reform. 
But I was more traditional in keeping the holid
ays. That™s -- was my mother -- my father 
wasn™t that way, my mother was in that way,
 very mu ch devoted to 
the -- to the tradition, 
background. I have never failed in my  -- in my  
feelings as -- as a Jew. Nothing to do with 
religion, it has to do with my  background, my  
cultural inclination, my  feeling about the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
the ethics of Judaism, due -- because our re
ligion goes by the rela -- by the relation with 
man. Between man and man, not with 
man and God, because if you do good by your 
fellow man, you do good by God. We don™t have 
a middle man, but I was never a very 
practicing Jew. We raised the kids as Jews
, with some of the Sabbath meals and the 
candles and taking the holidays and [inaudible]
, my  son was Bar Mitzvah. But not in the 
Orthodox sense. Often -- often, my  wife and I 
talk and we say we wish we could have 
really been stronger involved in -- in relig
ious venues. Although the holidays are kept. I 
never worked on a Jewish holiday. I made it 
a point not to. And I wanted to maintain 
that. When a -- when -- on Passover, I am very  strict about not eating bread, because 

again, it™s a -- it™s perhaps a symbolism, but 
it makes me what I am. And I™m thinking of 
my  mo ther, who said, ﬁYou take along your religious articles.ﬂ You know, the 

phylacteries and the tallith and the prayer 
shawl. They got damaged when I swam 
through the river. But she wanted me to, be
cause -- ﬁit will remind you of who you are. 
Never forget who you are, because if you 
forget, there™ll come a time when somebody 

will remind you of it.ﬂ And if the Nazis could re
mind us, at the end of a gun, who we are, 
certainly we owe it to ourselves to know who 
we are without -- without the gun. And that 
is the -- that is probably what motivates me 
to be a Jew. I never shied away from -- from 

saying it or from admitting it. ﬁYou Jewish?ﬂﬁOf course, who isn™t?ﬂ That™s what I 

would say. I come back with that. We went 
to -- on a cruise in February, we went to 
Jamaica. My ca -- the fellow that drove th
e -- drove the jitney, that -- that little, you 
know, that little bus that they had for us, tu rns around, to me, ﬁAre you Jewish?ﬂ Said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
60
 
 
 
 
ﬁYes, I am, but what difference does it make?ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou are --ﬂ Oh, I could 
have given -- I couldn™t have given him a chec
k, because I didn™t have -- I™m sorry. I -- I 
said, ﬁYou--ﬂ ﬁYou Jewish?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, 
wh-wh-why you asking that?ﬂ ﬁWell, over the 
ages, your people have been punished.ﬂ A
nd he gives me a lecture on Jesus. The 
Jamaicans are very religious, they™re very Ch
ristian. Then when we got to that place 
where he took us, at a vantage point like a -- a 
vista, I took him like on the side and I said, 
ﬁWhy did you ask me that? Why did that make 
any difference?ﬂ And I said to him, ﬁDo 
you know if Christ came back on earth today a
nd he came to Jamaica --ﬂ Oh, I ask him, 
ﬁIs there a synagogue in Jamaica?ﬂ ﬁOh, yes, in
 Kingston. It™s one of the oldest in the 
west.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou see, if Christ were comi
ng back today to Jamaica, he would look for 
that synagogue to go to, not to your church
.ﬂ I had to come back to him some -- 
somehow. I said, ﬁWe are all -- we are all the sa
me. Christ was Jewish.ﬂ I had to give this 
man a lesson. Why did he pick -- why di
d he pick on me? You know, people never 
actually -- not knowingly, take me for Jewish. They think I am Lebanese, Greek, Italian, 

what else -- South American. Because of my 
coloration maybe, my sk
in color. ﬁBut, what 
difference does it make,ﬂ I told him. And, ﬁYes I am.ﬂ I will never deny it. But my 

spirituality -- it™s often this way, if you are -- 
if you are just a little bit inclined to be who 
you are, as a Jew, for instance and -- and a cat
astrophe comes, it can easily extinguish it. 

But if you have a strong feeling about it a
nd a catastrophe comes, it™ll reinforce you. 
Because you want to prove, I have survived. 
It™s like again the metaphor with the wind 
and the flame. if you have a very small fl
ame, and a harsh -- a strong wind blows, it™ll 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
61
 
 
 
 
blow out the flame. If you have a big flame and a wind blows, it™ll enlarge the flame, you 
see? But, being that I have been persecuted 
as a Jew, I think it™s a duty to be committed 
as a Jew for the rest of my life. Because they
 wanted me to be gone and I have survived 
and if I am not what I am and show what I 
am, I™m giving them a victory. That would be 
posthumous victory, wouldn™t it? If I say, no, I wa
nt to give up my  Judaism, that™s all that 
Hitler would want. Hey, take Isaac Bashiv asinger, the writer. The Yiddish language was 

supposed to have been obliterated. And they we
re supposed to brag about that later, what 
they did to that culture. And there he co
mes and writes and wins the Nobel Prize for 
literature, writing in the Yiddish language. If H
itler had been alive then, he would have 
committed suicide again. Because this la
nguage was no -- was not supposed to have 
survived. So that is what you call it, a vindi
cation. A -- an assertion. You™re here, you 

live and one of the phrases that the Jews al
ways sing in the song 
and you may have heard 
that in Hebrew. Have you heard Im Israelha
im? The Jewish people who lives is alive. 
The word chaim means life. And you may be Jewish even. Are you? 

Q: No. 

A: No, you™re not. All right. What busine
ss is it? Why do you ask that? But you know -- 
yes -- 

Q: Do you have friends who were survivors? 

A: Oh yeah. Quite a few, yes. 

Q: Is there a connection that you have w
ith -- that you -- that you -- you could never 
really -- never really feel with people w
ho aren™t survivors? Is there a commonality? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
A: There is a commonality, but I am just as 
often more comfortable with people who are 
not survivors. We -- I have friends who are 
survivors, who have become -- in social 
matters, very -- what I call callous. Not what 
I would say as Jews we should be. Even to 
the point of some of my  friends saying, 
ﬁW-We really should do something about the 
immigration laws.ﬂ These are survivors. ﬁW
e really should do something about so and 
so.ﬂ Whether it™s the blacks. I prefer a fella
 who is not a survivor and lives by -- by the 
rules of -- of -- of good human mankind, rather than [indecipherable] I mean there™s -- 

some of the survivors are -- I -- I -- I have only a connection because -- because we 

belong to a same survivors group or -- or we be
long to a -- to an organization that™s the -- 
the Holocaust ca -- com -- mem -- Holo
caust Memorial -- not Memorial -- 
commemorative -- council of -- the Baltim
ore Jewish Council Ho-Holocaust 
Rememb ran ce Co mmittee. Ho lo cau st Rememb ra
nce Committee, so we -- we do often go 
together on panels and speak to classes. But 
I have a lot of friends who are -- this fellow 
here that just called me and so many others
 that -- that I am -- that I™m just as 
comfortable, often mo re comfortable than with
 survivors. Because w
ith survivors, they™re 
-- often the -- the conversation turns on t
hose -- on those subjects, you know. We have 
one lady that unfortunately is very ill, who 
when-whenever you see her, it has to be that 
subject to be talked about and it weighs on her day and night to the point where she is 

probably unstable mentally because of that. But 
that™s -- that™s -- that can happen, but I -- 
as I say, I feel I can acclimate in -- in -- in my  surroundings and feel comfortable both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
ways or uncomfortable both ways. That™s -- de
pends on the situation, the person and the -
- and the personality.  

Q: One thing about the perfume -- stable perfume and the cows -- 

A: Yes? 

Q: When you smell -- when -- you said you t
ook drives out in the country with your 
family and you smelled the -- the stables, what feeling did that evoke? 

A: It™s good feelings. Feelings of -- of 
being sheltered, feeling good. Viscerally 
invigorating. Because, I slept between two co
ws, after -- the -- the second night after my 
escape and I felt that nobody can find me and I heard them chew the cud and the odor 

was so nice, I felt I™ve pro-protected. I was in -- in goo -- in a good surrounding and 

peaceful. Pastoral. Nice. Like -- like hearing a -- a -- a nice melody play or something 

like that. Yeah, it™s -- it™s a -- it™s a good remi
niscence. I call it Chanel 65 or something 
like that. Yes, it™s -- it™s -- it™s -- it -- it brings 
back -- it brings back the memories -- just 
like the buckets that overflowed in the car, bri
ng back the other olfactory senses of -- of 
despair.  

Q: The buckets? 

A: In -- in the cattle car. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: That flowed over. That overflowed. We used
 it to -- to relieve ourselves. That was one 
bucket for 50 people, now you imagine that. That brings back despair. 

Q: The smell of outhouses. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, was putrid. Awful. 
Q: You call yourself a g -- a ghost of Auschwitz. 

A: Who called me that? 

Q: I thought you did. 

A: I was never in Auschwitz. 

Q: Well, then you™d never -- then you never -- you -- you escaped it. 

A: Yeah, I -- 

Q: Th-Th-Therefore you were a ghost, you never -- 

A: Yeah, I never got -- yeah, I was a -- a would be -- a would be Auschwitz internee or 

victim in the book -- in the book of the deporta
tions of Jews. I am listed as one who was 
gassed. 

Q: That™s right, I wanted you to talk about that. 

A: Because I do not have an asterisk next 
to my name. Because I wasn™t in France to 
have an input when the book was printed. My 
friend with whom I escaped has an asterisk 
next to his name. 

Q: So the official record shows -- 

A: Shows me as one that died in Auschwitz. In that book. 

Q: And you saw that book when you went back to France? 

A: No, no, no, I -- I saw it here when my 
friend Herbie Freedman, who lived then in 
Norfolk, got it from a cousin in France and I looked it -- I looked into it and found my  

name in there. I had shivers run down my  spin
e. Then my aunt sent me one from Paris. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
That was the book, yeah, that™s -- that is -- ha
s to [inaudible] -- has my  name in it and my  
date, where I was born and my name is actually misspelled and -- B-r-e-h-o-l-z. 
[indecipherable] 

Q: How old were you when you saw that? What year was that? 

A: In ‚78. 

Q: In ‚78. And you said it made shivers run down your spine? 

A: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely
, it was -- was a realization. I™m here, but in the book I™m -
- I™m -- I™m a victim, you know. I was then -- that was ‚78, I was 56 years old then. I™m -- 

I™m now 77.  

Q: I -- I -- I don™t have many mo re questions. I don™t know if there™s something -- 

A: Well, that™s good. And you know what? You 
may have some questions, but I may not 
even have any mo re answers. 

Q: Do you have anything that you wanted
 to say that I didn™t ask you about? 
A: No, you have the questions and as I said, 
my  life is -- was rather uneventful after -- 
after I came here, except for the trips, 
and the reminiscences and -- and no major 
achievements. You™ll have some people that 
will wind up to be professors and teachers 
and -- and -- and big businessman and inventor
s and scientists. I™m just here and I™m 
alive and I™m glad I™m alive and -- and I™m happy with what I am and what I have. And if 

that is a matter of being at ease, so be it. 
There are probably some things that -- that I 

would have done differently if I had -- had 
different opportunities perhaps. I would have 
studied people. My wife says, ﬁLeo, you sh 
-- could have been in
 law, you could have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
been teaching.ﬂ And some people tell me I coul
d have been teaching, because I speak to 
schools and get that reaction. But then again,
 it was -- it wasn™t and in hindsight, I am 
alive and that™s more than -- 
than I can say for my  mo ther and sisters and of course so 
many, many, many others. I lost over 30 memb ers 
of my family. But, if being alive is an 
achievement, so I have achieved something. A nd if being alive is just run of the mill -- 

what everybody does. They get born, they live 
and they™re alive and then some of them 
die, sooner or later. So I have -- I have my  -- 
my  life as it is and try to relax and sometime 
it™s a little hard, when you worry -- worry 
sometime about -- you know, now you worry -
- that you™re a grandfather, you worry about your
 grandchildren. And I guess, as long as 

your alive, that™s part of it. It wouldn™t 
be -- it wouldn™t be all that challenging if you 
didn™t have something to -- to be concerne
d with, you know. You always want the best 
for -- for your grandchildren, so you -- from time to time you worry, you know. 

Q: Has your health been good? 

A: My health™s been -- I -- I would say, yes it™
s been good. I have a slight case of angina 
and I™m on medication, but we™ve been 
talking and I™ve kept up with it, huh? 
Q: Yeah, absolutely. 

A: The emotions sometime get a little bit ahol
d of me and perhaps you noticed that and I 
can™t help that. That™s again part of -- of
 the make up, you know, as I said, there was a 
book written in the 50™s, ﬁYou Are What You Eat.ﬂ And in your emotions and in your 

emotional make up, you are the sum total of your
 life™s experiences. So that is one thing 
that is part of me and I™m coping pretty mu
ch with it. [indecipherable] friends are coming 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
here at five o™clock. In fact, we are goi
ng to a dinner theater tonight, so I™m going to 
enjoy my self. 
Q: Do you feel as though you™ve led a blessed life? 

A: Well, I feel that I™m probably married to
 the best woman in the world. I have my  

children and grandchildren. I have been very lu
cky. Very, very lucky. If not for that night 
on the sixth of November, 1942, we would not be
 sitting here talking to each other. So I 

am very lucky, there is no doubt about it and 
if you want to call it blessing, which gives it 
the -- the divine connotation, yes. If you want 
to call it lucky, which is mo re secular, you 
call it that. And I have a very good friend,
 Father Gallagher, who writes some very 
beautiful pieces. And he and I have been getting 
together, Catholic priest who used to be 
with the archdiocese here. And we get togeth
er from time to time and we do a little bit of 
philosophy and we do a little bit of reminiscing 
and as far as writing and words, we have 
a lot in common. And he just sent me this
 book. That™s the second book he sent me. He 
writes -- he writes free -- free verse poetry and th
is is Father flan -- Father Gallagher. And 
he writes -- he dedicates it. Can you read that? 

Q: ﬁFor Flo and Leo, with keen admiration, Joe Gallagher.ﬂ 

A: And we get together quite often and I 
-- I have -- talking before, you have Jewish 

friends? Yeah, I have Jewish -- I have a -- a -- a priest who is my friend. And we -- we 

get together and we have our moods and -- a nd our discussions and very, very nice man. 

And so I™m blessed. Yeah, I™m blessed with  family, I™m blessed with friends. And I™m 

not averse to using the word blessed. Because to 
be alive, after all, this is -- is basically a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
blessing and that -- that I -- I to -- I told it ye
sterday when I spoke to the FBI in the field 
office here in Baltimore. I said, ﬁWhen I escaped from the train, little would I have 
thought then that I was going to survive, le
t alone speaking to one of the wanted law 
enforcements agencies 
in the world, telling them how I circumvented the law.ﬂ But those 

laws, to me and to many others who could ha
ve -- would have done it if they could have, 
these laws were supposed to be circumvented, 
because if we didn™t, we wouldn™t survive. 
These were bad laws, done -- instituted by ba
d people. And after that a couple agents 
came to me and said, ﬁMr. Bretholz [indeciphe
rable] very interesting and I™ll tell you 

something. You made us feel very bad.ﬂ ﬁH ow is that?ﬂ ﬁYou made us feel bad about 

ourselfs. What we can become when we don™t act properly. I hope all of those who were 

here took your -- your talk to heart. But we 
were interesting in how you managed to get 
away, because we always want to find out how
 people manage to get away.ﬂ I said, ﬁDid 
you find out?ﬂ I said, ﬁI hope I did not in a
ny way or -- offend you or -- or challenge you 
with that.ﬂ ﬁNo, no, this was very interesti ng.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, those laws were so bad that 

we had to get around them. And escaping was against the law.ﬂ 

Q: How often do you think about th
at night, Novemb er sixth, 1943 -- 
A: ‚42. 
End of Tape Three, Side A

Q: How often do you think about th
at night, Novemb er sixth, 1943 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
A: ‚42. Quite often. I had to -- I could have
 given you the answer quickly, quite often, but 
I want to put it into context. Every time the 
sixth of every month runs around, I have an 
anniversary. There™s that yearly anniversar
y in Novemb er. But when it™s the sixth of 
whatever month it is, it always jumps out. A
nd there™s another thing, I was born on the 
sixth of March. 
Q: That™s my  mo ther™s birthday. In fact, 
you were born on the same day as my  mo ther. 
A: ‚21? Is your mo ther 77? 

Q: Mm-hm.  

A: Well, see -- now look at this. Now look at
 that great coincidence. I was born on the 

sixth of March and every sixth and mo st of th
e day -- mo st of the things that happened to 
me, mo st of the events happened in the first 10 days of the month. 

Q: What do you do on the anniversary, the year
ly anniversary, Novemb er sixth? Do you 

do anything special? 

A: Nothing special. 

Q: No. 

A: It™ll be s -- it™ll be 56 years now and when the book comes out, it™ll be the 60th 

anniversary of Kristallnacht, which is the ni
nth of Novemb er. That was the day I crossed 
into Belgium in 1938. And then I™m in touch 
with that nun that I contacted after the -- 
after the -- while I was writing my  book. A nun in whose care I was in the hospital in 

Limoge when I had a strangulation hernia, on th
e eighth of May, 1944, it is again the first 
10 [indecipherable]. And I woke up -- I woke up 
in that ward and I was afrai -- I wa -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
70
 
 
 
 
had been afraid that I would be recognized as
 a Jew in that Catholic hospital in Limoge. 
I™m circumcised. They don™t do that in Fr
ance. And also false papers and I™m under 
anesthesia. And who knows what can happen while I am -- I™m -- I™m o -- great fear. I -- I 
didn™t want to be taken to the hospital. And 
there™s this voice telling me, ﬁAs long as I™m 
in this ward, you have nothing to fear.ﬂ And wa
s the voice of Sister Jeanne d™Arc. Joan of 
Arc. 50 odd years later I wrote to the hospital, 
if they have a trace of her and they gave 
me her address where she is now. And I™m 
corresponding with her. Just got a card from 
her this week. Joan of Arc.  

Q: Can you read it? 

A: It™s French. 

Q: Can you translate? 

A: Sure.  

Q: If you don™t mind. 

A: This is Sister Joan of Arc. I had sent her a card for -- I had sent her a card for 

Pentecost -- for the Pentecost, you know, which 
is a holiday seven weeks after Easter, 
which is a Jewish holiday also, we have Pass
over and Shabouth. I sent her a nice flowery 
card. Let™s see how she puts across here. She™ s in castra, she is now in her 80™s. I 

contacted her. And she sends me this -- this
 little book marker. ﬁPour la metier inexist en 
neelia neeta, near fontier.ﬂ French. For fri
endship, no limits, no borders exist. She says, 
ﬁDear Mr. Bretholz. I don™t have the beautiful flowers for you or to -- to thank you -- to 

thank you for yours.ﬂ Because I sent her a card
 with flowers. ﬁBut I™m only asking that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016
 
 
71
 
 
 
 
this little barge that is depicted on this post card
,ﬂ this is a canal in Paris. She doesn™t live 
in Paris, but she -- this is a canal in Paris.
 ﬁThat this little barge will cross the ocean and 
will cross the ocean towards you and you can im
agine the distance and the ocean would 
not prevent it from bringing you my  best souve
nirs, my  best rememb rances. I™m very 
touched that you have thought 
about my  situation here.ﬂ I ask her how are you, are you 
well taken care of? Are you well installed in this home that you are -- Saint Joseph?  As a 
nun, she is. ﬁNothing I™m lacking -- I am not
 lacking -- I am not wanting anything and 
not for want of anything and the house is 
very well equipped and I am surrounded by my  

sisters, of whom some -- some of whom we
re also nurses with me in the hospital in 
Limoge in 1944. Give my  friendships to 
Madame Bretholz, your wife and your whole 
family. You are always present in my praye
r, that God will bless and will keep -- that -- 
may God bless you and keep you. Believe in my
 -- in the expression of my  mo st sincere 
friendship. Sister Jeanne d™Arc.ﬂ 

Q: Something.  

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Maybe that™s a good stopping point. 

A: Maybe it is. I™m sure it is. Thank you. 

Q: Thank you.
