th

Alexandria, 
Virginia .
 Good morning, Mr. 
Merin .  
Answer: Good morning.  
Q: Could you tell me where you were bor
n, when  you were born and what your 
name was at birth? 
A: Okay , it™s 
Harry Arnold Merin
. I was born in 
Holland, Amsterdam,
 
December 9
th
, 1941. 
Q: Wow, that™s interesting. And what were
 Œ what were your pa
rents like, what did 
they do? 

A: My Œ I don™t know what 
my  mo m did, but my  dad sold  Œ actually, during that 
time, I think he did advertis
ing, he did sign Œ made si
gns for stores and so  on. 
Q: Did you have any br
others and sisters? 

A: I have a sister who was born in
 Holland
 after the war, and then  a brother who 
was born in
 Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you™re the oldest. 

A: I™m the oldest. 
Q: Okay, so, obviously you were a baby Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555

A: Obviously. 
Q: Œ during the war. So tell me a little bit 
about what your parents were, where they 
were, what they were doing at
 this Œ wh en you were born. 
A: I don™t know. I know they moved, I Œ 
I™m not that Œ I don™t have the history 
exactly, of my parents. My parents really
 never discussed that with me. To me, I 
was considered too young. I know wh at 
he did after the war, I know they were 
hidden with different fam
ilies. O n e of them was in 
Broek in Waterland, 
would be 
with Œ would be 
Friese
(ph) and 
Preym
(ph) is the persons who they  were hidden ith 
Œ with. And that was right at the end of th
e war, and my  dad used to travel back and 
forth in 
Amsterdam
. He Œ he had invented
 and wore the origin
al roller skates, two 
wheels, and that™s what he 
traveled with, and Œ and they
 Œ they moved pretty fast. 
So, my  dad had s Œ put money away during 
the war so he could get to it. And so  
there were Œ I do know they were captur
ed once and they escap
ed. But otherwise, 
they had left me pretty we
ll in the dark. The 
only think I knew, I was at Œ at the 
camps, I w as picked up. I was with a nurse,
 picked up and taken to  the camp s. I 
found out a few years ago that I was part of
 a group of kids be
cause at my age you 
feel, how did I survive the camp, you know, 
when  you™re two and a half years old? I 
found out I was with a group calle d 
unv er kenter kinder in
, where there™s a whole 
memorial at the museum. There were 51 
of us, almo st all 
of us survived. 
Q: Hold on. All right. Sorry for the interr
uption. You were talk
ing about being in 
the camp.

A: Yes. I know I was in 
Bergen-Belsen
 and 
Theresienstadt. 
I was, after the war I 
was brought to 
Hilversum
, and I know my  dad picked  me up. Ag ain, not mu ch was 
said, but I do know he had 
fo und a mo torcycle, and picked me up in a mo torcycle 
from one of the buses, and that he had 
fo und my  name in a newspaper, under the 
name 
Yetterman
(ph). And when he got 
there, someone pointed to a sple Œ school 
buses, or buses, some type, and he pointed  
to which bus I wouldbe on. So th at is 
basically more than they us
ed to tell me. Because they
 used to, you know, f Œ a 
group of them got together, per se, my  pa
rents™ friends, who also either hidden or 
camp survivors, and they used to  discuss 
things. But I was basically  never allowed 
into the group. I do know my  mom has ha
d nightmares. I didn™t 
know how bad, that 
she basically had nightmare almo st every 
night. But that™s Œ was the point, so Œ 
Q: Was your family religious? 
A: My family was not very religious. We  kept kosher, but I was not Œ we™re not 
glatt
 kosher, and I still am not, 
but we did keep kosher. In 
Holland,
 if we traveled, 
we had salads, or fish. And that is Œ that™s 
it. Oh, except I Œ I Œ I know I used to go 
to services on Saturd ay, and my  dad would 
join me once in awhile, but most of the 
time I went to services, they sent me to 
services. Saturday I went by myself. And 
that would be probably from the age of si
x or seven. There was no fear of me 
getting lo st, I had a very  good 
sense of direction. And Œ  
Q: And this was in 
Holland
 still? 
A: This was in 
Holland.

Q: When you were born, did 
you Œ did you have a bris? 
A: I had a bris. I have records of what 
hospital I was born in, and I got records of 
things Œ the person who discov
ered me and br-brought me 
into this organization per 
se, is 
Hans van der Bruk, Kulp
(ph). 
Kulp
(ph) is his Jewish name. And he is the 
one who basically got this wh
ole group together. And th e 
only reason he™s not here 
this time is because he™s 
down with lung cancer. So Œ 
but otherwise,
 I would not 
know, and he™s Œ he™s had his hands on 
papers which are not open  to the public. 
Q: Right. 
A: He™s been able to 
get into the files in 
Holland
 somehow, and got documents 
which shows that Œ in fact, the lasttime when we had the conference in 
Holland
, I 
went to where my grandparents
 used to live. And, in fact , the first time, I was b ack 
about 10 years before that, so it would be 
about 13 years ago, the first time I went 
back to 
Holland.
 And I showed my wife where I used
 to live. I remember things Œ I 
remember what school I went to, 
how to find that. I went to the 
[indecipherable]
 
park. Again, I showed her 
my  house. I showed her wh ere the grocery was wh ere I 
used to go. They  had a very
 neat operation there. You can get fresh potatoes peeled. 
They  had a machine wh ere you threw your 
potatoes in. It peels it, it washes, you 
buy a pound, you buy two p
ounds, and you bring it home. And it™s some Œ you 
know, nobody in the 
States
 has seen, basically. And wh
en I went back there, I 
showed my wife where that machine wa
s at. So, things wh
at a small child 
remembers, that I re
member. When we left
 Holland
, they didn™t even tell me we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555

were leaving. They Œ they we
re very secretive about goi
ng anyplace. We just all of 
a sudden the car was piled up with suitcases, 
we were going on vacation. They just 
didn™t tell me we weren™t coming back . So Œ 
Q: Did you have any family left in
 Holland
? 
A: There was no family left. My mo m™s total fami ly was wiped out. My dad had a 

brother in the 
States
, and actually he has a sister who lives in 
New York,
 my  aunt, 
who was in the 
Nuremberg
 trials because she was a secretary to the 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Wow. 
A: So, that is all that I r
eally know. And like I said, I™m 
finding out about my  roots, 
basically, especially the first ca Œ 
so I ris Œ I™ve have a lot of 
incosy ncrasies
(ph) in  
my life, an d I found out I wasn™t the onl
y one. You know, I Œ I put more f Œ more 
food away  than most people, I Œ you kn
ow, we always have extra stuff. I don™t 
believe in wasting food. Of course, that™s
 one of the reason why I got a little fatter, 
because if the kids didn™t eat it all, I™d 
eat it. You don™t leave 
food on your plate. 
And I get upset with my son-in-law, who fills up a plate and then leaves half of it, 

you know. So, it just Œ so there are so
me items which I™ve grown up with, wh ich 
I™ve done, which make sense no
w, but they 
didn™t then. 
Q: Let me ask you, do you Œ th is is sort 
of an odd question, 
but wh at do you th ink 
your first memory is? What is the thi
ng th at you can rememb er first from your 
childhood, whether it be a picture of some
thing in  your br Œ in your mind, or Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
8
 
 
A: I have a Œ I have a Œ a block conference
. In other word s, anything wh ich is bad, 
which has happened  to  me, gets blocke
d out. I do know that when I was in the 
second grad e, and th ere was a lady, a girl in
 the first grade, who works at the Jewish 
Museum in 
Holland. 
When I went there the first time 
13 years ago, I was looking to 
see what type of info rmation I can find 
on me. And I gave her my  last name, and 
she turned  around and she says, you™re 
Ha rry .  
And my  mouth dropped open. 
Because at that time, when
 was in first grade, I st
ill remembered. But I have 
forgotten totally. 
Q: Right. 
A: It™s Œ it™s blo Œ it™s in there, but it™s 
blocked. I have phobi
as wh ich have come 
into light now, wh ich I™ve never had. 

Q: Right. 

A: I™ve got some thought about it, but I 
don™t know exactly w
hy, but I do know I™ve 
got some phobias which I didn't  have in th
e past and they™re coming out. So, but the 
[indecipherable]
 the shock of, for some odd reason,
 40 years later, she rememb ered 
my name, my first name
, my  story and so on. 
Q: Wow. 

A: So of course that means she™s got an
 excellent memo ry, maybe that™s why she™s 
working at the museum. 
Q: Where are you liber Œ sorry, this is Œ where are you liberated from?  
A: It would have been  from 
Bergen-Belsen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555

Q: 
Bergen-Belsen
, okay, so you were four years old? 
A: About four years old, yes.  
Q: Do you ha Œ you don™t ha
ve any recollection of that? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: I don™t remember anything. I do rememb
er the persons, the nurse where I stayed 
at, I know she was still alive after the wa
r, and I know my parents took me there, 

once in a great while. And again, I rememb
er things. Her husband, he was hard of 
hearing an d I reme mb er he had a big horn, 
and you had to speak in to that big horn. 
But, in other words, it™s 
items what a small ch ild w ill remember, close to the 
ground. 

Q: Right. 

A: Those are the things I remember. I rememb er in 
Holland, 
when I went to visit 
the house, which was also very unusua
l, because there was a fellow who was a 
cantor, who lived there now, 
a Jewish fellow. So, when I knocked, some stranger, 
I™m showing my wife where I used to liv
e 40 years ago. You know, they let me go 
in and I s Œ there used to be someth
ing down here, you know, like a frog in 
something. He says, yeah, we mo ved that 
Œ about Œ after we moved into the house 

10 years ago. So  those are the things you rememb er. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
10
 
 
A: So it™s Œ I remember my 
parents used to send me to 
[indeciphera ble]
 a lot. I 
don™t rememb er how, but there was a pl
ace back there, someplace how you can 
escape out of the backyard, and I used to
 wander through the Œ th e dunes there. 
Q: Right. 
A: At the beach. And again, I could be 
back in time for dinner, and they weren™t 
worried about me Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ I was a regular visitor there. 
They had a room for me year round. 
Q: Right. 
A: My parents used to trav
el a lot. After the war my dad sold ladies™ hats and 
dresses, and he was Œ he
 sold hats all through 
Europe. 
So  he had salespeople on the 
road, and th en ev ery so often he™d  go to 
all his clients, you kn
ow, personally. But Œ 
so Œ and I know I went to 
[indecipherable]
 but I didn™t like it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It was too structured . Bu t again, you 
know, for Œ for a six and seven year old Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ just be able to Œ they put me on 
a train, someone wo uld pick me up. And it 
would s Œ ag ain, one time my  sense of direction was Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ excellent. And I used to walk fro
m the synagogue where I went to Œ on 
Shabbas, for the high holidays,
 I walk all the way to this 
[indecipherable]
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
11
 
 
synagogue down town in 
Amsterdam
. And you know, it™s a Œ 
probably a good three 
mile walk, and considering wh en you™re
 seven and eight years old. You know, 
people nowadays wouldn™t let 
your child to go that far. 
Q: Right. 
A: But again, they didn™t 
worry about me, I™d find my
 way back, so Œ so it™s Œ 
Q: So when did you come to the 
United States? 
When does your family pack up 
the car and head into ha 
Œ what was the journey like? 
A: Well, I remember w e went to Œ my pare
nts had to do something, I was left in a 
child 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Germany
. Wer Œ I know we Œ we left out of 
Germany
. I 
was there, I was two weeks at camp over 
there. Again, a you
ng person doesn™t have 
any problem communication. 

Q: Right. 

A: Communication. And th ere was Œ oh, yo
u know, you had mine
fields there and 
bombs and stuff, but again, you know, I got 
along with the other 
kids, and we™d go 
Œ used to  go scavenging fo r metal, which yo
u can take to the junkyard, and then you 
can take that money and buy ca
ndies with it. So, you know Œ 
Q: Now it™s pretty good. 

A: Yeah, and then we were in a Œ a camp 
[indecipherable]
 camp, probably for at 
least six months. And it™s 
like apartment buildings an
d you know, you Œ I, of 
course, pick up the milk in 
the mo rning fu  Œ you know, in
 a bucket, and so on, and I 
don™t remember much else. I know there was Œ the 
Black Forest
 was nearby, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
12
 
 
it™s one place they said I shouldn™t go, becau
se you can get lost in there. But you 
know, know, they 
have paths and Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ we used to walk  on th e paths 
every so often. And I remember for 
Rosh 
Hashanah
, they had a 
Shochet
 there and they  would bake a live chicken, and it was 
Œ shochet 
it, you know, there on the spot and so 
on. So  Œ but otherwise, no. A-And 
I remember the boat trip over. We came 
in December, and they had a nice, big 
storm. And I know all the adults were sick
, and all us kids we
re happy because we 
got to go down  and Œ and have 
all the desser ts we want. So Œ 
Q: And where did you arrive into? 

A: We arrived actually, December the ninth in 
New Orleans. 
Q: Aha. 

A: And I have not been  able to figure out wh at ship I came on. I know it was a 
American destroyer Œ well, American ship 
of some type, which was converted to a 
passenger. But I don™t remember Œ 
Q: So you arrived 
on your birthday. 
A: I arrived on my  birthday. That made
 it easy for me to remember. And I 
remember they had a 
TV 
there, so you could watch 
Hopalong Cassidy
 and all 
these cowboy sh ows, which of course, I didn
™t understand, but y
ou know th at was Œ 
it was a movie. So Œ and us kids sat there in
 front of the tube wh
ile the adults were 
busy with ev erything what was going on. Ye
ah, I was Œ I turned 
10 when  I arrived. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
13
 
 
And I know we left 
Harlem
 when I was Œ was about eight
 and a half. We traveled 
actually to 
Euro pe
 for almost a y ear for Œ 
Q: And Œ and th en you moved to Œ to 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Th en  we mo v ed  from Œ  my  mo m wan ted  so mep lace warm, lik e so mep lace lik e 
New Orleans
, and my dad says no, we™ll go some
place a little further north, so we 
ended up in 
Saint Louis, 
since his brother lived in 
Sa int Louis. 
Q: Okay . 

A: We stayed there one summe
r, and then  we moved to 
Detroit
, it was too hot. The 
only thing you had in 
Saint Louis
 in those days were window air conditioners. It 
was very little Œ you didn™t have
 houses, you had window Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ you know, so that was it. So, like 
I said, one summer is all that it took. 
Q: Move farther north. 
A: Move further north. I remember
 Eisenhower, 
everybody was talking about 
Eisenhower
, and I was talking, who™s he? So Œ 
Q: And what languages were 
you speaking at this point? 

A: At that point I was still speaking Holla
nds. I did not know
 any English. You 
learned the word s yes and no, and so on. 
And thank you. I went to a Jewish day 
school in 
Sa int Lo uis
 for a few months, and my pare
nts didn™t think I was learning 
enough English. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
14
 
 
A: So I went to a public school. And like 
I said, by th at fall we Œ we were moving Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ to Œ to 
Detroit
. I know we stayed in the apar
tment for probably about a year, 
and then  we moved into  a house. 
Q: Mm-hm. And you were speaking more E
nglish by this point, 
were you picking it 
up? How was Œ 
A: I was Œ well, I was picking Œ I was lear
ning mo re English as I was going along, 
yes. 

Q: And how was school for you? 
A: Nowadays, they have persons who speak
 your language and th ey  take you to 
through the year right along. 
In those days they did not. 
I know I started off in first 
grade with  Œ with English and then  I pr
ogressed Œ you know, I™d skip  one or two 
semester Œ you know, you Œ du
ring Œ during th e year I™d move up one mo re grade. 

Math I was all right in. 
Q: Mm-hm. Cause it™s a universal language. 

A: But story problems I still ha
ve problems with. My wife 
Œ in fact, even in college, 
my wife Œ I™d write the paper, then my wife
 translates it, corre
cts the spelling, and 
everything. Because in English 
I™m very poor at spelling. 
And that™s Œ that™s it, but 
she did my  term papers and everything else.  
Q: So where did you wi
nd up going to college? 
A: I went to, actually, 
Perdue 
University. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
15
 
 
Q: 
Perdue. 
What did you study? 
A: Interior decorating. 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: So, and that™s my field. 

Q: Wow. And did you meet 
your wife in college, or 
did you know her before? 
A: No, I Œ I knew her before, she was a blind date. 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: And Œ 

Q: And she™s Œ she™s originally from? 
A: 
Fort Wayne. 
Q: 
Fort Wayne. 
A: Yeah, yeah, we got married in ™71 a
nd I had been dating her for almo st nine 
years. So Œ 

Q: A-And how many ki
ds do you have?  
A: We have three kids, and I got seven grandkids. 
Q: Wow, that™s wonderful. 
A: So Œ and my  two daughters live in 
Cincinnati. 
My  son-in-law, well, a month ago 
he finally closed Œ he had a restaurant, a 
kosher restaurant here
. And he did not get 
support of the city. Ninety percent of hi
s clients during the day were non-Jewish, 
and he Œ he finally had to close it. 

Q: Yeah. That™s too bad. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
16
 
 
A: Closed it up just before the holidays 
because basically  with the holidays, you™re 
closed all month an yhow, so. 
Q: Right, right. Well, is there anything el
se you want to menti
on, anything else you 
want to ad d? Anything el
se you™re thinking about? 
A: It™s basically, like I said, with the 
conferences, I™m fin d ing out stuff. I don™t 
know almo st nothing ab out my  parents. Agai
n, they wouldn't talk about it. I did find 

out from my  aunt that my  dad used to live on the border between 
Germa ny
 and
 
Holland
, and th en he basically s
nuck across the border into 
Holland. 
And my  dad 
says, if you pay taxes and stuff, they™ll let you stay. 

Q: Right. 
A: As long as you™re paying
 them good money, they u Œ they want you to  stay. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And  th ey  Œ  h e  met my  mo m in  
Holland
 and th ey got married. I do have th e 
records of that becau
se I want to Œ in 
Amsterdam
, I want to Œ what e Œ whatever 
the house is, whatever Œ it™s a registrant
, you know, for information and I Œ I got 
actually copies of my  mo m™s, and I got 
a copy of my birth certificate there. 

Q: Right. Bu t it™s just something that you™ve blocked. 
A: Yeah, I wa Œ that part I didn™t block. 

Q: Right. But Œ 
A: But I never knew about it. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0555 
17
 
 
A: Again, th-there are incidents in my  life which I have blocked. 
Q: Right. 
A: I just Œ and I still do that today. 
Q: And did you ever ask your
 parents about any of this, 
or was it just one of those 
things that you just didn™t do? 

A: My parents Œ no, European-w ise, you ju st
 didn™t do it. And if you did ask, oh, 
it™s not important, it™s Œ you know, we really
 don™t want to Œ basically, we really 
don™t want to talk about it to you. 

Q: Right. 
A: Okay. Actually, my brothe
r found out more than I did. And well, by that time Œ 
he is 18 years younger than me, and my  
did didn™t have the strength to fight 
[indecipherable]
. So, he is th Œ he is the baby, an
d my mom is still alive, but she is 
not totally coherent any mo re, she™s Œ sh
e is, but she isn™t. She can™t Œ she™s 
bedridden, and she has been for 
the last three years, totally. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So Œ 
Q: It™s too hard.  
A: Yeah, it just Œ yeah. And like I said, 
you do have her story on tape, which Œ 
Q: I do. Well, is there anythi
ng else you want to add? 
A: No.
