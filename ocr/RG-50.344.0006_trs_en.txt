there until I graduated from high 
school and went in training.

July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: Well, my  aunt was a nurse, she 
worked down Doctor™s Hospital in 
New York
 and 
she always liked it and she had been a nurse in the first World War and -- just figured 
that it was something I wanted to do. I 
enjoy helping -- working with people and -- 
Q: Had she told you stories about being a nurse -- 

A: She had, yeah. 

Q: -- in the war? 

A: Yeah, yeah, she did. In fact, she married
 -- while she was in the war, she married a 
doctor and she had a really nice life and she 
traveled a great deal and she wou -- then, 
after she came out -- well, I guess she had -- 
after she was divorced, she worked as a -- 
in charge of the operating room at Doctor™s Hospital in 
New York
 and so I decided to 
go into 
Saint Vincent™s 
for training. 
Q: And when did you get out? 

A: 1943. And I -- shortly after that -- well, mo
st of the girls were going in the service 
and -- 
[inaudible]
 I went, I wanted -- my  best friend was going into the army  nurse 
corps, but I didn™t -- flight -- flight nurse. I didn™t particularly care for that, so I just 

went into the -- the army nurse corps. 

Q: Do you think mo st of the people in your
 -- that graduated from nurse™s training 
with you, went into the service, was that your impression? 

A: I think -- I think mo st of them did. 
Not -- not all, some of them were getting 
married, some of them were -- wanted to st
ay and work at -- you know, stateside, but I

would say the majority of us went into the 
service, either the navy or the army  nurse 
corps. 
Q: Mm-hm. It™s so -- did it s -- fe -- it felt lik
e sort of the thing to do? A lot of people -
- 

A: It did. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, everybody was going there at the time. Well, I can rememb er working on 

one of the wa -- halls and they came and said  when -- that the Japanese had attacked 
Pearl Harbor
 and we all thought that was such 
a shocking thing, that you know, they 
-- here these boys were taken so comp letely
 unawares and decided that this would be 
the type of the thing we would like to do, 
you know, go in and help take care of them. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Mm. 

Q: And -- and you enlisted then, in ‚43 did you say? 

A: ‚43. 

Q: Where at? Where did you go in? 
A: I was inducted in 
Fort Dix, New Jersey
 and then we went to 
Atlantic City 
for our 
basic training. I can™t remember where I went. I stayed at 
Fort Dix 
for quite awhile, 
until we got our or -- oh yes, I guess I stayed there until we got our orders to go with 
the 131st evacuation hospital. 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

July 15, 1998 
 
 
Q: And what was the basic training like? 
A: Oh, I rememb er long marches along the streets in 
Atlantic City. 
It was a nice place 
to take your basic training. Climbing under 
fences and practicing with your gas masks 
and ex -- a lot of exercises and -- and the 
social life there in the evening was -- was 

good. We like the different -- like 
Glenn Miller
 was there. In fact we saw him the first 
-- the last time he played in the 
States and he flew from there to 
England
 and his plane 
was lost. But the basic training, you know, 
was very strenuous and concentrated. And 
right from there, I forget where I went then
. I remember staying there for quite awhile. 
Q: Mm-hm. And then  you got orders to join the 131st? 
A: 131st, yeah. 

Q: And -- and then what happened? 
Where did you go or what was the -- 
[indecipherable] 
the next major thing that you rememb er? 
A: I remember getting on the ship, the 
Queen Elizabeth
, that -- we were all surprised 
that we were going to go over on that. And th
at was a very hairy ride, with the mines 
and whatnot in the water that time. And we ended up in 
Greenock, Scotland
. And 
that™s where -- I was saying downstairs -- ex
cuse me -- the Salvation Army was there 
to greet us with coffee and donuts. And then we went on from there to 
Alteringham, 
England
 and we were living in a private home wh-when -- all I can rememb er it was 

freezing. They only heated the house with fi
replace -- didn™t keep you very warm. But 
we rented bikes and we rode around the count
ryside and then we were as-assigned to a 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

general hospital, I can™t rememb er the numbe
r of the general hospital and we worked 
there with the boys that were being brought back from 
Europe. 
Q: This was the winter of ‚45 -- ‚45, right? 
A: ‚45, right, yeah, yeah. I remember 
going to Christmas eve mass and it was so 
foggy, we had to hang onto one
 another walking down the 
street and you couldn™t see 
in front of you. And from there we got our or
ders to go -- to get the h-hospital -- to get 
-- we -- a lot of -- I guess some of the girls went to different hospitals, I™m not sure 

about that, though. 
Q: In
 England
, you mean? 
A: In
 England
, yeah. General hospitals. 
Q: But they -- but you were just taking care of 
GI™s 
-- American 
GI™s
? 
A: 
GI™s
, oh yeah, just American 
GI™s
, yes. In fact I met a boy I knew from home, from 
Bridgeport
. He -- I had him as a patient. He had been injured at 
Anzio
. And -- fact I 
saw him several times after we got out of
 the service, exchanged experiences. And 
then we got -- the hospital unit got together again and we went over the 
chelver
 into 
Sudan, France
, as I rememb er and we set up our tents and all named -- heh -- gave 
them all different names. I think I lived in
 Fools Rush In. And some -- Idiot™s Delight 
was one, or something. And -- 
Q: What was it like living in a te
nt? This was in the spring, now? 
A: This was in the spring, yes. 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

July 15, 1998 
 
 
Q: April? March, April? 
A: I guess. Must have been, cause I know we were in 
England 
in Christmastime and 
then -- yeah, it must have been
 early spring. It was fun. We had -- we slept on cots and 
we had air mattresses, and so it was fairly comfortable. The only thing was the 
showering and bathing and all, that was rath
er difficult, but then we started to get 
patients there to take care of, they were br
inging some back from the front and we got 
our first experience there of actua
lly being an evacuation hospital. 
Q: And how was that different from what you™d done before? 

A: Oh, oh it was quite different, because you 
were all set up in tents, you know and it 
was -- well, you know, it -- it -- the -- the general hospital in -- in 
England
, I think that 
mu st have been a regular hospital that 
they had taken over and they had all the 
facilities, whereas out in the field,
 you -- you know -- you didn™t -- you just had 
temporary, makeshift things, but it didn™t se
em as though we were there too long. As I 
said, I can™t remember all this. 

Q: How was it -- that was the first time you had -- were caring then, for -- 

A: For actual casualties that were coming in from the war front, yes. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: Well, it was very challenging. You coul
d hear -- in fact, from where we were you 

could hear the bombs and 
hear shooting and stuff. 
Q: Were you frightened? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: Not -- not really. No, no. We knew we we
ren™t right up on the front line, we were 
far enough back, that -- and -- 
Q: Did you talk to the injured men? 

A: Oh yes, yeah. Oh, ye
ah, I talked to them. 
Q: What did they want to talk about? 

A: Most of them wanted to talk about 
their girls back home and how homesick they 
were and couldn™t wait til they got back and 
if they weren™t inju
red very much, they 
said, ﬁOh, this means I™ve got to go back
 into the war -- fighting again,ﬂ you know, 
and I -- but others that were being -- that™s -- if they were mo re seriously wounded, 
were shipped back to 
England
 and then they 
vess
 eventually they went home or were 
taken care of there. And I think it was there 
that we got word that one of our nurse™s 
husban -- it was at -- yes, it was at the Ba
ttle of the Bulge and her husband was lost 
and reported as either dead or a prisoner 
of war and then as we went along -- can™t 
remember where we were, 
Mike
 showed up. And that was exciting, you know, that he 
was actually a -- a prisoner, taken a prisone
r and a colonel friend set them up in a 
house and they were able to be together th
ere. Then we moved on -- oh, we had to get 
our 
Eisenhower
 jackets or something, so we all p
iled in the big truck and went into -- 
Q: What were those? 
A: They were those short jackets that -- they named them after 
Eisenhower
 because I 
believe he wore them. And we didn™t have th
em to -- to go on further, so we drove into 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

July 15, 1998 
 
 
Belgium
 and oh, those people were just so happy to see the Americans, they were so 
friendly. And -- 
Q: Why did you have to get those jackets? 

A: I don™t -- I guess it was accepted ca -- to wear in the battle areas, or something. I 

don™t rememb er, but I know we were told we
 had to go up there, so we got in big 
trucks and went along and were
 singing the army  songs as we went up to pick them 
up. And then shortly after that we must  have moved out and I --remember exactly 

where we went from there. 
Q: Wha -- When you were there -- this was in 
Germany
? 
A: Right. 
Q: What -- What was your particular res
ponsibility? What -- what was your job? Were 
you in a ward or an operating room, or -- 

A: N-No, no, I was in a ward, yeah. 

Q: Caring -- 
A: Dispensing medication 
and dressings and yeah 
[indecipherable] 
Q: These were men who™d been operated on, some of them? 
A: Some of them had been operated on, 
yeah, some of them had -- you know, a broken 
leg and some shrapnel wounds and -- helped to take care of them. 

Q: Mm-hm. And then you stayed there for aw
hile and then moved? You moved a lot? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist

July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: We moved quite often and I can™t rememb
er all the different places we moved. 
Can™t even rememb er where we -- I should have  read my  thing I have at home. I didn™t 

re -- expect to have to tell it. 

A: But you did -- you did move around? 
Q: We moved around quite a bit, yeah 
and finally we got -- we went into 
Austria
 and 
that was just gorgeous. We lived in regular homes in 
Austria
 and they -- right through 
-- it was near vee -- it was near 
Linz, Austria
. And it was across from ver -- 
Vienna 
and very often at night, the Russians would 
be shooting out the lights and shooting at 
the wires and the -- your electricity would go 
out. They had  maids who came and they 
polished your shoes and did di
fferent things for you while you were there. These were, 
I guess, local Austrian girls. And then we 
had to go to -- the only thing I can rememb er 
is go -- they told us we were going to a c
oncentration camp . And the one thing that I 
can rememb er mo st about that was for miles 
before we got there, was the smell -- the 
dead bodies rotting, oh. That was just -- it 
was hard to believe. And when we would 
get there, you just see the bodies all pile
d up, you know and then they eventually 
would dig trenches, they would just -- they
 couldn™t make coffins for them fast enough 
and dug -- put them in common graves. And we 
went in and they were -- mo st of those 
people that were not dead, that were s -- 
who they had -- mo st of them, they had 
practiced on. They practiced taking out an 
appendix or practiced removing an arm or a 
leg and these people needed to be nur
sed back, you know. And you al -- you couldn™t 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
10
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
speak their language, but you could almo st fe
el that they knew what you were saying 
and  you -- course, sort of knew what they were
 saying, they were just so glad to see 
somebody come in. Their food was so terrible 
and mo st of them looked like skeletons. 
I have pictures of them. And -- 
Q: What was your work -- daily work there? 

A: Mostly just taking care of these patients,
 a lot of them of course, they had had 

operations and they were left in -- had -- all 
infected and you had to take care of those 
and put clean dressings on and try it on some of
 them that -- help w
ith the therapy, to 
help them to get walking. They were ba -- 
they put them -- like if they had taken a leg 
off or something, then they would be wa
lking on crutches and 
you would be helping 
them with that, and --  

Q: What was the place where you worked, and what was -- 

A: It was a tent. Most of these patients were all like in tents or shacks, if I remember. 

I™m not sure which -- what it was. It wasn™t -- it was nothing, you know, like -- it 

didn™t look like a hospital at all, excepting 
that there were rows of beds where the 

patients were in. A lot of them had casts on 
as I rememb er and they wanted you to sign 
it for them. 

Q: So you didn™t set up your hospital -- tent
 hospital there, you worked in their -- 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
11
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: Well, I think our -- our men had gone ah
ead and I think they had set up some of 
this, because by the time we got there, they 
were -- the area where we were going to be 
working was set up. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Yeah. Cause they went on ahead of us, now
 that I think of it and I -- unless they -- I 
don™t think that they were -- had any type of
 hospital set up before they got in there, 

but -- but they might have, I™m not sure. 

Q: So you worked with people? Others have 
told me that they never touched patients 
or they were not supposed to touch pa
tients, but it sounds like you were changing 
dressings and -- 

A: Oh yes, you were changing dressings a
nd helping them to wa -- and then you™d 
take them outside and have them walk and ge
t out in the fresh air, cause most of them 
hadn™t seen daylight or sunlight and all th
ey gave them was bread and water and -- to 
eat. And I loved the bread, it was that dark 
bread that they get overseas. But I mean, 
not -- not any nourishing food,
 they hadn™t had. And -- 
Q: Were they men or women or both, or -- 

A: They were both. They were both, but mo s
tly men. The majority I -- as I recall, were 
men. But they -- there were some women th
ere, too, yeah. I didn™t see any children. 
There might have been, but I don™t rememb er seeing them. 

Q: Did you -- do you rememb er caring for women as well as men? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
12
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: No, I don™t. I don™t rememb er having wome
n patients. I rememb er just having male 
patients, as -- now that I think about it. 
Q: And do you know -- d-did you know then who they were or where they were from, 

or -- 

A: No. You knew where -- they -- they would 
tell you where they were from, yes, they 
would tell you where they were from, but -- 

Q: Did you know at that time whether or 
not they were Jewish people or not? 
A: No, I didn™t, no. Some of them would -- you knew -- they said they were, but mo st 

of them you would just t-try to get out fro
m where they came from. A lot of them 
seemed to be -- come from 
Poland
 and -- it was hard to understand them, but you -- 
yo-you know, you tried to deciphe
r as mu ch as you could. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did they try and express to you anything at all -- some of them? 

A: They tried constantly to express thei
r gratitude, you know, for what we were doing 
for them, they -- and hope that they woul d get that -- w -- you know, well and be able 
to go back home again, if there was any home to go to, 
[indecipherable]
 often said 
that. They didn™t know what the conditions
 were going to be like back home.  
Q: Were you able to do mu ch for them over the period of time you were there? 
A: I think that they -- a lot of them I -- we thought -- felt were improving and were 

putting weight back on and -- especially 
I can rememb er one young man on crutches 
and then he seemed to be able to wa -- go 
to a cane and could walk with a cane and did 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
13
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
get help. Course a lot of -- I guess they just
 kept them in a bed, or in -- I don™t know 
where they kept them and -- so that they 
didn™t get up and were able to really move 
around until we had gotten in there, I guess.  
Q: Do you have any i-idea of what else
 was going on there while you were there? I 
mean, was there continuing to bury bodies while you were there? That was going on? 

A: Well, we s -- oh yes, they were conti
nually burying the bodies, yeah, yeah. They -- 
a lot of them died while we were there, t
oo, but they also were burying the bodies that 
were piled up when we got there. And when
 they could then ev
entually they had a 
cemetery and they would put, you know, little 
markers on each one. But at first it was 
just a communal grave where they had to put the bodies. And there was the 

crematorium that they used to burn them a
nd gas them. They had that and they burned 
that down while we were there to prev
ent the spread of disease, I guess. 
Q: You saw that? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah. 

Q: What did you think when you saw that, did you -- 

A: Couldn™t believe it. And what upset me
 the mo st was you would see these reels 
from home and people said, ﬁThat™s not
 true, that™s all propaganda.ﬂ 
Q: What do you mean reels? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
14
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: They said they were army  -- my  parents would write, you know, they were army  
reels and that would say that it was all propa
ganda, that these things didn™t happen. In 
the movie theaters, apparently 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Oh, newsreels? 

A: Newsreels, yes, yes. They must have 
shown them and I said, ﬁWell then, let them 
come over here and see it.ﬂ And because, 
it -- even today you™ll hear people say that 

they don™t believe it existed and it certainly did.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Mm. 

Q: When you were seeing that, did you have 
any sense of -- of how widespread it was 
in 
Europe
? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you -- 

A: No, we really didn™t at that time, no, 
til we then heard about so many of the other 
concentration camps and all. Th
ey were much bigger than camp
 Gusen
. I guess 
Mauthausen
 and some of them were mu ch larger and had a lot mo re, you know, 
prisoners than we did, but at that
 time we had no idea of that, no. 
Q: Were -- did you have any sense of how 
the people in the town were reacting to 
this? Did you have any contact with people in the -- in -- in 
Linz
? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
15
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: Not really, not really, no. Just the girl 
-- th -- some of the women that would work -
- work at the camp that were -- you know, lived
 in the village, but they didn™t say very 
mu ch, and -- of course there was a language
 barrier. Couldn™t really understand them 
all.  
Q: Do you rememb er people coming to 
Gusen
 from the town to -- to do work or -- 
A: I don™t rememb er -- not at the -- no, not with the patients they weren™t, no. Not that 
I rememb er. They could have, but I really don™t rememb er that. 

Q: Did you have any other s -- 
did you have any sense of -- of
 what kinds of things the 
people were doing and when they were inmates there? Were they --  

A: Don™t think -- 

Q: -- do you know about the -- I mean, for example, I know there was a quarry nearby 

where people had to carry stones. 

A: Yes, yes, I do remember hearing -- 

Q: Did you see that, or -- 

A: I don™t rememb er seeing that, but I do reme
mb er hearing about it, yeah. They had -- 

they -- they di -- I know they were tru -- cr
uelly mistreated because they also had a -- 
the commandant hung in effigy. I guess the pris
oners that were there and they finally 
had gotten home, I have a picture of him ha
nging there and was something else I had -
- just 
[indecipherable]
 skipped my  mind. Oh, taking their skin and making 
lamp shades out of it. 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
16
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
Q: You heard about that or you saw that? 
A: Oh yeah -- no, I heard about that, but I di
d see one of the lamp shades and they said 
it was made from the skin of the patients th
at were there. This was the commandant -- 
commandant™s wife or somebody made -- 
was supposed to have made these. 
Q: Where did you see that lamp shade? 

A: There, there. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Were all of the -- all of the survivors w ho were there ill or were s-some people able 

to go around and -- 

A: Some of them were able to go around and do some of the -- the work, you know, 

cleaning up and yeah, they weren™t a -- they 
were functional, yeah, they weren™t all, 
you know, like bedridden people or that had th
ings wrong with them, no. That -- wa -- 
that™s where we were supposed to, you know, do 
mo st of our -- was with the sick ones, 
but there were others walking around and -- all looked like skeletons, though.  
Q: How long were you there at 
Gusen
, roughly? 
A: Seems like we were there about three months or so, but I™m not -- I really can™t 

remember. I have all those things written down at home 
[indecipherable] 
Q: And then after that? 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
17
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
A: From there, can™t remember where we went. We went to a camp, but I can™t 
remember where -- cause I remember being there on 
VE 
Day and celebrating -- 
Q: 
VE 
Day? 
A: -- the victory. Yeah. 

Q: 
VE 
Day
 
before you went to 
Gusen
. 
A: Well, that was before, that™s right, that™s right. 
Q: Right. 
A: That™s right. No, that™s right, yes, yes 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Other people have mentioned a camp  called -- it™s named after a cigarette -- in 

France. 
A: Twen -- 
Q: 20 grand? 

A: 20 grand, yes, yes, right. 

Q: Is that the one you™re thinking of? 

A: 20 grand, yes, that™s what I™m thinking of. 
Q: In
 France
? 
A: In 
France
, yeah.  
Q: And you were -- 

A: And from there we learned we were going home -- to go to the 
Pacific
. And some 
of them that were -- we were -- there were 
several ho-hospitals there and a lot of them 

Interview with Mary Bergquist 
 
18
 
July 15, 1998 
 
 
were going directly to the 
Pacific
, but we were supposed to go home -- wi -- go home 
on leave and we went home on the 
General Bliss
 as I remember and were home on 
leave when they dropped the bomb on 
Hiroshima
. And then I was shipped out to -- 
where was it, it was where they have the r
acetress -- racetracks out -- hm, we used to 
go to the races once in a while, that -- 
Bonnie
 -- did you interview 
Bonnie
?  
Q: Not yet. 
A: Oh. She and I were roommates there. 
Q: It wasn™t 
Texas
, was it? 
A: No, it wasn™t 
Texas. 
Gee, I know it as well as I know my  own name, but my  
memo ry™s getting very bad. 
Q: But you didn™t go -- at any rate, you didn™t go -- 
A: We did not go to the 
Pacific
 and then was discharged from there. And I got on an 
army plane and flew out to 
California 
to visit my sister and that was it. 
Q: So you were in for what, about a year? 
A: N -- About 18 months I™d say, yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And I wanted to go back and ask you what you thought when the 
bomb was dropped on 
Hiroshima
. 
A: I was very, very happy to think that it would save so many lives instead of, you 

know, continuing this horrible war a
nd I wasn™t anxious to go to the 
Pacific
  myself, 
being selfish, but I was so glad for the 
boys that didn™t have to, you know, lose their

lives fighting over there. Yeah, I know I thought
 that it was a very, very wise decision 
at the time.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When you look back now, 50 years later 
on that year, and especially on that 
experience you had, witnessing what had ha
ppened at the concentration camp , what 
does it mean to you? What -- how -- how has is affected you? 

A: Well, it was an experience that I would never have wanted to miss. I felt that, you 

know, we did a lot of good and got a lot out 
of it my -myself, I enjoyed it and I™d do it 
again if -- if the opportunity had come, you know
, if I was to go into the service. Not 

now, but, you know -- but I really thought it wa
s a very rewarding experience. Patients 
were all so very happy you know, were glad 
to see you and you felt that -- as I said, 
you felt you were doing something. I felt I wa
s doing mo re there than I would have 
been if I went to work in a -- a hospital or
 -- here in the States or, you know, into one 
of the -- couple of my  friends went into the -- like 
Siko rsky ™s 
and different places, 
worked as industrial nurses, but I thought
 being an army  nurse was the best. 
Q: And th-the experience you had, especially at 
Gusen
, how do you think of that, how 
does -- what -- what did you learn from that? 

A: Well, I -- hopefully I learned that -- that 
this would never, ever happen again. And I 
have often -- I™ve spoken to some groups a
nd -- to let them know that it really did

happen and I had sent the pictures to sc
hool and my  children, you know, have brought 
it up when they™ve been in school and studi
ed it. And gone into school occasionally 

and talked to some of the classes, because  so many of the people still felt that it was -- 

it was just a lie, that it never had o -- had oc
curred and so I felt it was important to let 
them know that it did. And racial discrimi
nation and whatnot cert
ainly shouldn™t be a 
part of our lives.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Learned that. 

Q: What else? I -- I -- I know we just kind of 
did a brief review, but what did -- is there 
anything you™d like to say, or any par
ticular memo ry that you want to -- 

A: No, not really. As I said, a lot of 
it I just can™t even remember any more. 
Q: It seems -- it™s so interesting to me th
at 50 years later, this group of women is still 
in touch with each other. 

A: Yeah, yeah, we have kept up. We 
have a round robin and then we™ve gotten 
together, you know, for reunions, but -- well, in
 my  training school is the same thing, 
we -- we™ve gotten -- every five years we go to 
New York City 
and get together and 
have a reunion. It™s nice to keep -- we have
 so mu ch in common. I think this is, you 
know, what keeps -- keeps us coming and getting together. 

Q:  You ha -- is it just what you did then that you have in common?

A: No, I think living for that length of 
time together and living under not very good 
conditions, you know, you just sort of got mu ch
 closer to the girls than you normally 
would, you know, if you were in the every 
day world. You slept together, you wash 
together, you eat together and 
you were -- had a common purpose. 
Q: All right. Good, good. Well, thank you. Let me
 -- I have to say that this is the end 
of the interview with 
Mary Rita Bergquist
