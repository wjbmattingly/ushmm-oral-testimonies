USHMM ŒMarty Glickman  (5-20-96)  

Tape 1 of 4 

 

Q: Marty, I™d like you to begin by telling 
me  your name , where you were born, date 
  of birth. 

 

A: My name  is Martin Irvin 
Glickman.  I™m usually referre
d to as Marty Glickman.  I 
was born in the Bronx.  At the age of 6 
I moved to Brooklyn.  I was raised in 
Brooklyn. 
 

Q: And what year were you born? 

 

A: I was born in 1917.  My parents came 
from Romania.  They came over about 
1912.  I don™t reme mber  exactly when.  I wasn™t around when they got here.  But I 

was born in 1917.  Lived or
iginally in the Bronx. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit about 
your childhood and your fa mily. 
 

A: My father was not an extremely religi
ous person.  As a ma tter of fact uh he was 
Jewish.  We  observed the High Holy Days
.  Occasionally on Shabbat we™d go to 

synagogue, only occasionally.  My gr andfat
her and grandmother on my mother™s 

side were, kept a kosher home  uh with the 
two sets of dishes and the silverware 
and things like that.  I was bar mitzva
hed.  I went to Hebrew school and uh I 
raised my own children in the Jewish faith.  And my two sons were bar 
mitzvahed.  My two daughters were not 
bar mitzvahed, but we have a Jewish 
background, a Hebrew background. 
 
Q: Was that very important to you as a boy? 

 

A: It wasn™t uh very important in terms of
 my uh, uh grand feeling about Judaism.  I 
was like any other kid.  I, I was brou
ght up in Jewish neighborhoods, mi xed 
neighborhoods actually.  Uh we liv
ed amongst Italians and Irish. 
 

Q: Why don™t you start that again because you™
ve sort of conflic
ted yourself.  What 
kind of neighborhood were you brought up in demographically? 
 

A: I was brought up in a, a mi xed ne
ighborhood.  I was brought up in a, a mixed 
Irish, Italian and Jewish 
neighborhood.  There certainl
y were as ma ny Jewish 
boys around with whom I played as ther
e were people of other faiths.  And I 
didn™t feel unusual about being a Jew.  
Uh ma ny of my friends went to Hebrew 
school with me  and ma ny of my classmat
es in school were Jews.  Uh it was uh 
nothing out of the ordinary be
ing Jewi sh in my neighborhood. 
 

Q: Then you didn™t feel any anti-S
emitism from the non-Jewish kids? 

 
 
2

2
 
A: Occasionally we™d get into a fight.  Uh 
I had an older cousin who was a big strong 
young ma n and he fought with an Italian boy one day because he was called a Jew 

Bastard.  And uh he got into a fight, and uh 
I™m pleased to say that my cousin won 
the fight.  But I never actually uh struck
 a blow because I was called a, a Jew 
Bastard or anything like that
.  Uh as I say I was amongst Jews most of the time. 
 

Q: So you really never felt in any way sl
ighted because you were Jewish or you 
never saw that as some thing that you™d have to rally against? 
 

A: I never felt as though I, I had to overcom
e the fact that I was a Jew.  I was aware 
however that I was Jewish.  And uh, uh 
the great athletes of the day uh, Venny 
Leonard was my father™s hero.  Another 
great prize fighter name d Leach Cross uh 
was a ma n t hat he admi red greatly.  And 
uh Hank Greenberg was one of my early 
heroes.  So I was aware of Jewish athletes and Jewish competitors who did well.  I 

wanted to do well also to show that a 
Jew could do just as we ll, perhaps better, 

than anybody else. 
 

Q: Then there was that distinction.  How 
i mportant were sports
 and how did you get 
involved in sports? 
 

A: I got involved in sports because I was always the fa stest kid on the block.  I could 
run faster than anybody else could run.  
And, and uh I found this true until I ran 
against Jesse Owens,  He was the one fe
llow I couldn™t beat, never could beat 
him.  But other than that I was, as I sa y, the fastest kid around.  And because of 

that I had an advantage in any sport I 
played.  So I played, punch ball, and box 
ball, and ring-a-leaveo, the game s kids 
played in the Bronx and Brooklyn in those 
days.  And when I started playing basketba
ll or baseball or football, because I had 
the speed, I had an advantage and so I c
ould be perhaps better than some  of the 
other guys.  I could almo st st
eal first base in baseball. 
 

Q: So you started sports 
at a fairly early age? 

 

A: I started sports, I started 
my first running when I was uh five years of age I think.  
Uh we used to run around the block.  A
nd uh we™d start in opposite directions, I 
and my opponent would run off around the bl ock and we™d come  back to the same  

spot.  And the first one returned to that
 spot was the winner.  And uh the older 
guys in the neighborhood would ma tch me  
against some of t he older boys there 
because I could beat the fellows my age ra
ther handily.  And I almost never lost .  
I don™t remember losing a race until I ran against Jesse. 
 

Q: Now when did this running and sort of
 neighborhood sports become  sports in a 
more organized fashion? 
 

A: Sports for me became more organi ze
d when I went to Junior High School.  
Montauk Junior High School in Brooklyn. 
 And uh I played on four different 

 
 
3

3
teams.  I was a catcher on the baseball team.  I played on the 
basketball team.  We 
won a city championship in, in basketba
ll.  Also won a city championship in 
baseball.  Uh I ran on the track team and I was the field day champion.  I was the 
fastest runner in the school.  And of all things I 
swa m on the swimming team.  
And in those days athletes played all s
ports in season.  In the spring and summer 

you played baseball.  In the fall you play
ed football.  In the wi nter time you 
played basketball.  And all year round 
you ran.  I don™t ever reme mber walking as 
if as a young person.  I always ran.  
It was just my nature to run. 
 

Q: So sports were very 
important to you it seems. 

 

A: Sports were critical to me .  Uh my
 life was built around sports.  And I think it 
began when I started reading the Merry
well books.  Now uh those of you who are 
my age ma y well reme mber the Merrywell books. They were written by Bert L. 

Standish and Frank Merrywell was thepremier hero.  He had a younger brother 

name d Dick Merrywell who also was a 
great athlete.  And Frank Merrywe ll 
ma rried and had a son name d Frank Merrywell
, Jr., who also was a great athlete.  
And I wanted to be like Frank Merrywell 
junior or senior or Di ck Merrywell.  

And uh the exploits of the book, I starte
d reading them I guess when I was 12 
years of age, and I wanted to duplicate those exploits.  He ultima tely went to 

Yale.  Became  an all Œ American football
 player, basketball player, a champion in 

all the sports he particip
ated in and a, a well Œ ro
unded All Œ American type 
person.  I wa nted to be Frank Merrywell.  
I still reme mber his, his, his girlfriend™s 
name whom he married.  Her name was 
Inez.  I married a person named Margery, 
but I me t her in high school.  So it wa s 
uh, uh it was my, my goal to be like Frank 
Merrywell, this fictional character. 
 

Q: Then your goal was to be this 
quintessential All Œ American guy? 
 

A: Yes that™s right.  I wanted to be the uh
 as good as I possibly could be in sports and 
also be a good student, because Frank 
Merrywell was a good student.  I, I wound 

up being, I would say, uh a B student.  
Uh I never had problems passing a, a 
courses in school.  I was uh a fair student. 
 

Q: So there is actually one story I™m cu
rious about.  When you talk about how active 
you were in sports and how they really were  your life at that point.  Did you think 

that you had a future in sports, that you mi
ght be thinking in te
rms of Olympics or 
an athletic career? 
 

A: I never thought in terms of having a future
 in sports.  I never aspired, for example, 
to be a, a sports announcer.  Thatcame  through my uh the good day I had, the 

best day I ever had on a football field.  
But the only reference I recall as to having 
aspirations in sports was in my uh Juni
or High School graduating year when I was 
all of 14 years of age.  My home r
oom teacher, a man name d Hugh Brown, who 
was an alumnus of Yale, wrote in my
 yearbook Œ be seeing you in the 1936 
Olympics.  And I thought that was very nice
.  I was a fast runner in school.  But 

 
 
4

4
uh I was only 14.  I didn™t th
ink in terms of the Olympic ga mes, but he predicted 
it. 
 
Q: After you read that did you think ah ha 
ma ybe that is where I™m going or is that 
some thing I should aspire to? 
 

A: I didn™t think in terms of the Olympic games until I was uh well into my uh 
freshman ye ar at Syracuse University.  Uh I was a, a school boy champion as a 

sprinter.  I wa s the, the city champi
on, the state champion, the national sprint 
champion, but I didn™t think in terms of
 the in terms of the Olympic game s 
because I, I was still a kid.  I was 17.  
And uh only in my freshman year when I 
began to win against important competiti
on did I realize I ha
d a chance to make 
the team.  And when I won the me tropolit
an championships in New York City 
and then the Eastern Olympic trials up at
 Harvard against a great sprinter name d 
Ben Johnson.  When I beat Ben he wa
s uh, uh, he was uh the world™s record 
holder at 60 yards indoors, and when I beat
 him I realized then just a, a month 
before the Ol ympic ga mes that I had a chance to make the Olympic team. 
 

Q: I™m going to ask you to repeat one senten
ce.  Not the whole thing.  When you said 
some thing about not until I was in my freshman year.  Can you say not until I was 

in my freshman year in college? 
 

A: Not only my  freshman year in college di
d I realize that I had 
a chance to make the 
Olympic team?   I was uh a high school
 champion, New York City sprint 
champion for several years, and New Yo
rk State champion.  I was also the 
national interscholastic schoolboy champion. 
 I and I knew I could run fast, but I 
didn™t know how fast I ran un
til I ran against uh so me of
 the better sprinters in 
America and was able to beat them, part
icular ly a fe llow fr om Columbia name d 
Ben Johnson, an outstanding sprinter.  He
 was the world™s record holder at 60 
yards indoors and when I beat Ben, beat 
him a couple of times, I realized I had a 
shot for the Olympic team and that was 
at the end of my freshman year at 
Syracuse. 
 

Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or 
goal, was there anyt
hing different about 
being a Jewish American athlete than
 just being another great athlete? 
 

A: In my high s c hool years and my juni
or high school years, there was nothing 
different about being a Jewish
 high school athlete certainly not in New York City.  
I™d competed against everyone.  And uh I fe
lt no different than other athletes in 
school.  It was only in my uh freshman year
 at Syracuse University that I became  

aware of the fact that I might have been 
a little bit different when at my fi rst 
training table meal as a freshman, I aske
d uh at lunch, the very first meal, please 
pass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed 
at the table, because they weren™t 
lamb chops.  They were pork chops. So I r
ealized then I was a little bit different 
than most of the other guys on the football squad.

Q: Did it motivate you differently?   Did 
you think about it differently when you 
competed? 
 
A: I was always aware of the fact thatI™m a Jew.  Uh never unaware of it under 
virtually all circumstances.  And uh even
 in uh the high school competitions and 
certainly at college and uh for the Olympic 
team I wanted to show that uh a Jew 
could do just  as well as any other indi
vidual no matter what his race, creed or 
color and perhaps even better.  And uh it wasn™t  until uh the, the circumstances 

developed in the Olympic game s when I wa
s refused the opportunity to run in the 
game s uh be cause of the fact I™m Jewish. 
 

Q: At this time  you™re a little bit older, 
you™re a little bit smar
ter about what™s going 
on in the rest of the world, were you more
 aware of the restri
ctions applied to 
Jews.  I me a n in your, in your community 
growing up it was very mi xed.  It didn™t 
seem to be an issue.  But were you aware that there was anti Œ Se mitism in 

America, that you couldn™t go everywhere 
you wanted to and that sort of thing? 
 

A: I was certainly aware of the fact that  there was anti Œ Semitism.  My grandfather 
and my father, my uncles, told me  about
 the pogroms  in Europe and Romania.  

They™d heard about the pogroms in Poland 
as well and in other parts of Europe 
and Russia and I was aware of uh anti Œ Semitism.  In New York City I wa s also 

aware of the fact that there were certai
n places I was not welcome.  I mi ght go 
into a hotel for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which 

read restricted clientele, which meant in
 effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed.  There 
were certain areas around New York City
 where you couldn™t liv
e.  Like Darian, 
Connecticut , for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own 
home s in Darian.  And uh I was aware of th
at.  Uh my folks would tell me and my 
in Œ laws later on uh told me  about rese
rvations they ma de at a hotel and my 
father Œ in Œ law™s name  was Dor man a
nd uh neither Jewish or Gentile, and he 
would try to check into a hotel having 
ma de a reservation at
 so me resort and 
being turned away when they found out he
 was Jewish.  He mi ght check in as 
Jack Dorma n, which he was, but his friends and associates mi ght have name s like 

Goldberg or Cohen or Goldstein 
and the group wa s turned away uh upon 
occasion.  So I was aware.  I was aware of anti Œ Se mitism.  In New York and 

throughout the country as well. 
 

Q: How much i n the early 30™s did you know
 about what was going on in Europe and 
Germany in particular? 
 

A: I knew practically nothing about
 what was going on in uh Germany uh 
specifically and in Europe 
generally, except that I™d he
ard about the pogroms  in 
eastern Europe basically as I me ntioned in Roma nia and Poland and Russia.  Uh 

but I was not specifically aware until my 
freshman year at Syracuse when as a 
political science ma jor I began to learn of
 the uh anti Œ Semitism that uh some of 
the Fascist countries were subjecting Jews
 to, particularly in Nazi Germany.  
There was anti Œ Semitism in Germa ny.  I knew that.  And there was anti Œ 

 
 
6

6
Se mitism in America.  The uh Nuremberg laws as I understand it were pa ssed in 
1933.  I was aware that there were. 
 

Q: I think 35.  There were
 restricti
ons from 33. 
 

A: I™msorry. 

 

Q: –startover. 

 

A: Yes.  I, I, I was aware of the Nure
mberg laws which were passed in 1935.  Um 
Hitler had come  to power in 1933.  As a 
political science ma jor at Syracuse 
University, I was aware of those anti Œ Se
mitic laws, but these were me rely on the 
books uh like the laws perhaps, not going to
 certain hotels, not going into certain 
areas, the unwritten laws, or
 the law about not crossi
ng against a red light if 
you™re crossing the street.  Uh they were
 not seriously spoken nor seriously taken 
in the States.  We  were aware of it.  
But how, how they affected individuals I 
didn™t know. 
 

Q: And you didn™t have any fa mily in Europe? 

 

A: At that time uh the family I had in Eu
rope uh were my father™s brothers who uh 
lived in Roma nia and were still there.
  But uh I didn™t know how they were 
affected by it at all. 
 

Q: Okay.  It™s just interesting to 
know, you know, what you knew before going over 
to Germany.  Tell me  about qualifying 
for the Olympics.  How did that come  
about?  
 

A: I qualified for the Olympic game s by wi
nning a series of races to qualify for the 
final trials which were held at Randall™s
 Island in New York City uh the fi rst use 
of that Randall™s Island Stadium for track
 and field championships.  I qualified by 
winning the metropolitan championships and then the eastern qualifying round up 

at Harvard Stadium in Boston.  There we
re Eastern, Near Œ Midwestern, We stern, 

and Far western trials and I was the winner of the sprint  in the East so I qualified 

for the final round.  It was a series of
 qualifying rounds and I and about, I would 
guess, 14 other sprinters qualified for the 
final round.  And in 
that final round I 
qualified and made the team. 
 

Q: How did you place in those final rounds?   What happened there? 

 

A: Uh the placeme nt in the final round, in 
the actual finals, I 
qualified by finishing 
second in my uh in that semi  Œ final heat
 uh at Randall™s Island.  And uh I™d like 
to tell the story of uh my 
first race against Je sse Owens
 and Ralph Metcalfe.  Uh 
these two were the two great black spri
nters of the day.  Uh we drew uh, uh 
marbles which we numb ered for the lanes 
in which you ran.  I 
drew lane number 
5.  Jesse Owns was in lane number 4.  Ralph Metcalfe was in lane number 6.  And 

 
 
7

7
I™m in numb er 5.  So here is Owens, 
the world™s champion, alongside of me .  
Metcalfe, who™d run and won a silver in the 1932 Olympic game s, on the other 
side.  These two ma gnificent athletes on either
 side of me  and I™m scared stiff.  I 
mean I was shaking so that when the starte
r called us to our ma rks, to put our feet 
in the starting holes, we 
didn™t use starting blocks in those days, you dug holes 
with a trowel.  When I started to put my 
front foot, my left foot, in the hole, my 
foot was shaking so I could not put my f
oot in that starting hole.  It was just 
vibrating so I couldn™t put it down.  And a
ll six additional spri nter s on either side 
of me  were on, on their ma rks, getting r
eady to go, and I™m still standing there 
shaking.  And the starter called everyone up and called me  over to him.  I knew 

the ma n.  Uh he™d started me  in some of
 the high school races I had run, and he 
said Marty walk up and down a bit, take 
a few deep breaths, relax, jog up and 
down, relax, and we™ll try 
to start again.  And afte
r several mi nutes uh I was 
calmed down sufficiently to get my foot into
 that starting hole. 
 Both feet in and 
we raced.  Uh I don™t reme mber the gun going 
off.  We  were set terribly tense of 
course on our ma rks, and then set, and 
then I was running.  And there was Owens 
on my left and Metcalfe on 
my right and for forty yards I™m r unning even with 
them.  And t hen suddenly as though they were on an escalator and I was not they 

were pulling ahead and moving ahead.  A
nd I fought as best 
I could and I kept 
dropping back.  And uh then I realized I wa
sn™t going to catch e
ither one of them 
and I thought I finished third in the race.  Uh so much so that uh Ted Using who 

was broadcasting the race on the infield of
 the track, he was the leading track and 
field broadcaster of the time .  Uh Te d calle
d me  over after the race and said here™s 
Marty Glickman, the kid from Brooklyn w
ho finished third.  Oh wait a second he 
said.  I see they™ve placed Frank Wy coff th
ird.  Marty finished fourth.  And he 
interviews Fr ank and then he says now he
re™s Mar, oh just a mome nt he says, uh 
they™ve pl aced Floyd Draper in the fourth
 place, Marty fini shed fifth.  So he 
interviewed Floyd Draper and then he, he 
interviewed me  fini
shing fifth.  Which 
is where I wa s placed.  I was a bit upse
t about that .  Uh films fr om the race 
indicate that uh I beat Floyd Draper by a f
oot uh.  Very little question about that.  
As for Frank and myself, you could, you 
could choose the winner between the 
two of us, but uh, uh I didn™t know whether I 
beat Frank or not.  Nor did he.  Uh 
later in Paris in a post Œ Olympic me et 
I beat Frank but uh, uh we were virtually 
in a dead heat for third pl ace.  So I, 
I so reme mbe r  Dean Cromwell finishing uh, 
uh it™s too long already. 
 
Q: Yeah.  I guess I™m asking was there some
thing that happened there, that was a 
precursor of anything else? 
 

A: Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell lead
s to another story which has to do with 
the selection uh my ouster from the team. 
 So uh if you can fit this in.  As we 

finished the race, I noted that Dean Cr om
well, the assist ant head track coac h of  
the American Olympic team and the head
 track coach of the University of 
Southern California, was in amongst the o fficials, arguing with them that Frank 

Wycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper
 had finished fourth.  Because he was 
the coach of Southern Cal and Wycoff a
nd Drape r  ran for Southern Cal or had 

 
 
8

8
run.  Wycoff was graduated.  Had run for 
Southern Cal.  These were his boys and 
he pushed them a mongst the officials uh as 
finishing third and fourth.  And I was 
placed fifth.  I don™t know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth.  I just don™t 

know.  But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the 

order of finish. 
 

Q: And you think it was clearly favoritism
, not the fact that you were a Jew?  
 

A: I think it was clearly favoritism that
 uh he wanted his boys placed third and 
fourth.  Uh the fact that I was Jewish 
I think did not ma tter at that time .  He 
wanted his boys in there.  And uh I had ma de the team anyhow because the first 

seven me n were to ma ke the team.  The 
first three finisher
s running the 100 me ter 
run, and the next four finishers ma king up 
the 400 me ter relay. 
 So I had made the 
team. 
 

Q: Any other Jews on the team?  

 

A: The other Jew on the track team, one ot
her Jew wa s Sam Stoller.  Stoller was 
placed sixth in the 100 me ter final.  He fi
nished behind me .  He ran a poor race.  
Later Sam beat me in the Olympic Village
 in a trial race we 
had amongst the three 
of us.  Sa m Stoller finishing first.  
I was beaten by a shoulder by Sam, and we 
both beat Floyd Draper.  Floyd Dr
aper wound up running on the team. 
 

Q: We™ll get to that.  Now after you qualifi
ed for the Olympic team, what sort of 
preparation was there between those qua
lifying rounds at Randall™s Island and 
going to Berlin? 
 

A: We qualified for the Olympic team uh on a uh Friday and we  were on board the 
ship I believe on Tuesday, heading for uh Berlin.  It was almost imme diate.  Uh 

we were me asured for our uniforms.  Uh
 there were several events we attended, 
uh several ceremonies we attended and we 
were aboard ship uh within three days 
after ma king the team.  It was very 
quick.  There was no training period or 
anything like that.  We  stayed in shape, 
of course.  We  kept working out every 
day to ma ke sure we were in good condition.  And we took the S.S. Manhattan for 

Berlin. 
 

Q: Now this sounds pretty exciting.  I don™
t know how much you had traveled before 
then, but winning these rounds and then a 
few days later being on a boat going to 
Europe sounds like a big deal. 
 

A: This was quite an experience for me .  I had been no farther than Boston.  I™d been 
no further south than Philadelphia until that
 time .  I was uh this 18 year old kid 
from Brooklyn.  I was the second youngestkid on the team, on the track team.  

And here I was aboard this ma gnificent li
ner heading for Europe and uh it was a 
most exciting time.  Uh it was wonderful, 
it was thrilling, it wa s, it was great.  It 
was fulfilling my Frank Merrywell dr eam partially.

Q: What was it like on the boat? 

 

A: The boat was uh informa l .  It was fun.  Uh
 we, we  trained aboard the ship.  It was 
a, a five day crossing and 
a sixth day getting uh to Ha mburg and then down to 
Berlin by train.  Uh but we had no opportunity 
to really sprint aboard ship.  So we 
did calisthenics, we jogged up and down, we
 did a great deal of walking aboard 

ship.  We  uh watched our diet fairly car
efully.  Uh there was no specific traini ng 
regime n because we were all pr etty goodathletes, had our own different coaches 

and coaching techniques applied to us fo
r months and years beforehand.  So we 

were not concerned with uh being uh directed by the coaches who were on the 

team. It was a fun time.  It was, it was a time that was loose and easy and pl easant 

and, and we looked forward with great an
ticipation to getting to Europe and 
getting in competition.

Tape 2 of 4 

 

(five seconds) 

 

Q: I want to backtrack for a mo me nt
.  Prior to your going to Berlin, do you 
reme mber any conversation, any newspa
per articles, any talk of America 

boycotting the Olympics because of wh
at was going on already in Germa ny? 
 

A: At the time  we were competing in the 
uh regional finals and 
then the fi nals at  
Randall™s Island uh the talk was so slight
 that I truly was 
not aware of the 
possibility of a boycott of the 1936 game s.  It
 had very little play in the press if 
any.  I don™t reme mber seeing it in the news papers or hearing it on the radio.  As a 

ma tter of actual fact, no Jewish organizati
on like B™nai Brith 
or uh ADL or uh the 
American Jewish Congress if there wa s an AJC then.  Uh no Jewish  
            organizati
on nor any individual ev
er said to me , Marty don™t go.  There was no 
talk, general talk, of boycott.  I know now
 that there was a vote taken involving 
the AAU, the Amateur Athletic Union, 
and the American Olympic Committee 
and that uh they voted to go.  Uh but th
ere was no such publicity or promotion 
such as existed in 1980 when the Presiden
t of our United States, Jimmy Carter, uh 
strongly recommended that 
we don™t participate in the 1980 game s.  There was no 
such popular move ment at the time of 1936. 
 

Q: And you we ren™t aware that there were
 athletes who had decided not to go on 
their own? 
 

A: I was not aware of any athletes who decided not to go.  I know now that athletes 
uh say they decided not to go.  There was a 
fine sprinter whom I never met, never 
ran against, fellow name d Herman Newgas, of Tulane, who determined that he 

 
 
10

10
was nor going to try out for the team.  Uh he didn™t go, he didn™t try out for the 
team.  But I knew that later, in later years. 
 

Q: So this was just not an issue? 

 

A: The fact of going or not going was not an 
issue.  Not as far as I was concerned nor 
in terms of t he public press or the populace generally.  Uh we didn™t think in 

terms of not going. 
 

Q: Tell me about the trip over, the antici
pation, what it was like being on the boat? 
 

A: Being on the boat was fun.  Being on 
the boat was a brand new experience 
particularly for a kid from 
Brooklyn or any of us who™d never been abroad.  Uh 
I™d been no farther north than uh, uh than Bo
ston.  I™d been no farther south than 
Philadelphia, and here I was uh an 
eighteen year old kid from Brooklyn uh 
heading for Europe.  Uh had been, a 
name, a place my parents came from, going 
to Germany, and uh visiting other countries
 as we ll.  Our first stop for example 
was uh in Ireland with the ship.  Just 
stopping there and seei
ng it in the distance 
and how beautifully green it was.  We
 stopped in England mo me ntarily at 
Plymouth and I could, uh I couldn™t see th
e Plymouth Rock or anything like that 
and uh, uh but it was Pl ymouth England and then we went across to uh, uh 

Germany to uh, uh landed in Hambur g a
nd from Ha mburg took the train down 
into the uh heart of Berlin 
to the huge Bahnhof in Berlin. 
 

Q: What was going on on that boat?  What 
was the mood?   People were I assume  
fairly excited. 
 

A: All of us were pleased at having ma de
 the team.  And uh the boat was wide open.  
In those days a huge ship uh like the Ma
nhattan uh had differe
nt classes, first 
class, second class, uh cabin class or wh
atever, steerage even.  Uh but we had the 

run of the boat.  And uh, uh those we at
e in what amounted to uh the uh second 

class dining room, we were not
 in the top categories of
 dining room, we had huge 
me nus to choose from.  We were not give
n training table food.  We  selected our 
own foods.  There was a fellow on the team
 na me d Tarzan Brown.  Uh an Indian, 
Narragansett Indian from Maine who™d ne
ver seen a me nu like this before.  And 
Tarzan was a ma rathon runner.  He wei
ghed perhaps a hundred and thirty pounds.  

Uh, uh a great ma rathon runner.  He™d won the Boston ma rathon.  On the team 

and we had uh this huge menu.  And every meal, every day, he ate the menu from 

top to bottom.  I mean si
x appetizers, and two or th
ree soups, and four ma in 
courses.  In those six days on the ship 
uh he mi ght have put on between 10 and 11 
pounds.  He ran the first mile of the ma
rathon and uh then he sat by the wayside 
and uh gave it all up. 
 

Q: How were you spending your time on the boat? 

 

 
 
11

11
A: We spent our time on the boat talking, uh working out, uh calisthenics mostly.  
Jogging up and down on some  of the very shor
t, straight aways on deck.  Uh there 
was no facility to really work out the wa
y we would have ordi
narily on a, a cinder 
track or  a clay track, certain
ly no quarter Œ mile track aboard ship.  Uh but we, we 
stretched, uh we jogged, we walked, we 
did exercises and uh we talked and we 
read and uh, uh generally it was a group 
of guys having a good time together.  
There were women on the team as well, 
but uh, I guess I was not involved nor 
interested in any of the wome n.  I ha
d a girlfriend who later became my wife. 
 
Q: Was there any special cama raderie amongs
t the few Jewish athletes on the boat? 
 

A: There was no special cama raderie amongst 
the Jewish athletes except a, a warm 
friendship that I developed with a, a ba
seball player, Herman Goldberg, who was 
a catcher on the exhibition baseball te
am.  There was no international baseball 
competition.  America was practically the only place where baseball was played 

in those days.  So it was a demonstrati
on.  An exhibition team and he was on the 
team and on the Olympic team.  Herman wa
s, a catcher on the team.  We hit it off 
very nicely.  But usually uh with the athl
etes from the different sports, the track 
athletes stayed together, uh the gymnast
s were together, the swimmers were 
together.  Not that we didn™t fraternize w
ith each other but we
 had much more in 
common with Olympic team.  
 

Q: Now when you say you talked a lot, what
 did you talk about?   What it wa s going 
to be like in Berlin competing or? 
 

A: We didn™t talk about uh about what Europe was going to
 be like.  We  talked uh 
about mostly about America.  We  talk
ed about uh, uh baseball and football and 
particularly about track and 
field.  Uh we told stories, we swapped yarns.  We  
were, how can I say it best, we werea bunch of guys who enjoyed each other.  

We had enormous respect for each other.
  And I as one of the younger fellows on 
the team, looked up to some of the older 
me n who were not only older but bigger 
and stronger uh that one.  And uh it was ju
st a very pleasant time, a group of 

young me n being with each other enj
oying uh the sea voyage, enjoying each 
other™s company. 
 

Q: Did you think about the fact that you we
re representing the United States in the 
Oly mpics?  
 

A: It™s rather unusual uh for me  or any athl
ete to say that uh we 
represented America.  
I didn™t feel as though I represented the US
A.  Uh I represented me .  I wa s a, I 
was glad I wa s on the team.  It was a goal I had sought.  It was uh an achieveme nt 

for me .  It was an individual thing.  Af
ter all the Ol ympic ga mes in theory and I 
strongly believe this, the Olympic game s ar
e for the individual, for the excellence 
of the individual and theoretically th
ough we wear national uniforms we don™t 
represent the different countri
es who™s uniforms  we wear.  We represent athletes.  
We represent sports.  We  compete in sports for sports™ sake.  The competition is 

 
 
12

12
all important.  Wi nning is not important. 
 Baron de Coubertin who founded the 
modern Olympic game s insisted, has b
een quoted ma ny times  as saying, winning 
is not the goal of the Olympic game s, 
taking part, particip
ating is what the 
Olympic games are all about.  So it wasn
™t as though we were going there to win 
for the United States.  That was the thought
 that was perhaps in the back of our 
mi nds.  It was not a conscious thought
.  We  were going as athletes, not 
necessarily as Americans.  I was going ther
e as a Jewish American athl ete, but as 
an athlete basically.  A Je w, 
an Ame r ican, and an athlete. 
 

Q: What™s the reality of what you™re sayi
ng that there is that there are no, are you 
saying theoretically there 
are no national lines, ther
e ar e no politics in the 
Olympics?  I mean that certainly isn™ t my perception. 
 

A: People say that there are politics in 
the Olympic game s.  I say hogwash.  I say 
nonsense.  Where does politic
s fit in when you run 100 me
ters?   Or 1500 me ters?   
Or put the shot?  Or even play basketba
ll agains t each other?
  What politics are 
involved?   The first ma n across the finish
 line wins.  No ma tte
r what the race.  
The ma n who puts the shot a longer dist
ance than any other is the gold me dal 
winner, or spins the discus, or throws the 
javelin or whatever the event.  There are 
no politics amongst the athletes.  You ta
lk about politics amongst the nations.  
Certainly.  But not as far as the Olympic 
game s are concerned.  They don™t exist.  
Politics are not involved in terms of 
winning and losing.  That™s a good kasook 
right? 
 

Q: Well I just clearly nations have used 
those gold me dals in a political frame work. 
 
A: I don™t believe that at all.  I don™t 
believe that the uh, having uh, me dal winners 
for a particular country in terms of a nyt
hing important, anything solid.  After all, 
the East Germans were terrific as long
 as East Germany existed and they uh 
sought and worked hard to get, to devel
op great Olympic athletes.  And the Soviet 
Union won ma ny, many me dals, domi nated 
a couple of Olympic game s, and, and 
certainly the uh, the uh the Italians  to some  extent won ma ny Olympic events as 
well as ot her Fascist countries doing we
ll and centered their interest  in the 

Olympic games.  And where is the Sovi
et Union today?   Where are the East 

Germans today?   Where is Nazi Germany 
today?   They just don™t exist any more 
and Nazi Germany won more me dal s in th
e ™36 game s than the United States did.  
33 to 26.  Although they won me dals for dre
ssage and for pistol shooting and rifle 
shooting and things like that.  Uh I d
on™t see the importance of international 
athletics in terms of politics at all.  They
 say that the governments use it, but even 
the successful Olympic teams like Germany and East Germany and the Soviet 

Union, where are they?   
What good did it do them?  
 

Q: I don™t necessarily need 
to belabor this, 
but except for that in 1936 Germa ny™s 
successes not only in presenting the Olympics
 but in also winning a lot of me dals, 
ma y have be en an encouragement, ma y have spurred them on in ways at that time . 
 

 
 
13

13
A: Many people say that uh the ™36 Olym
pic game s were the Nazi Olympics or 
Hitler™s Olympic games.  I saw that they were Jesse Owens Olympic game s.  The 
myth of Naz i  Aryan supremacy was s mashed to smithereens by the great non Œ 

Aryan athletes.  Black athletes, wonde
rful black athletes, won the 100, the 200, 
the 400, the 800, the long jump, uh t he high jump, me daled in ma ny other events 

as well.  It was the Olympic game s of Jesse Owens not of Adolph Hitler.  Jesse 

was idolized by the German population.  He
 couldn™t walk into the stadium using 
the regular pl ayer™s entrance into the stad
ium.  He had to be secreted into the 
stadium.  He had to use a secret entrance to get in.  Otherwise he™d been mobbed 

by the uh idolizing uh German population or
 whoever the spectators were and 
they were mostly Germans in the 120,000 seat stadium.  It was Jesse Owens 

Olympics as far as I was concerned, and I 
think as far as the world was concerned.  
And it certainly proved that uh this Aryan 
business of supremacy was ridiculous.  
There were non Œ Aryans winning 
the most i mportant events. 
 

Q: Let™s go back to your story now.  So you 
had this terrific boa
t ride over and tell 
me  about your arrival and getti
ng to Berlin and all of that. 
 

A: We arrived at the Bahnof in 
Berlin at mi dday in a huge crowd. 
 

Q: Let me  just stop.  You arrived on the boat in Hamburg.  Yes? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Was there anybody there to greet you? 

 
A: We went right to the train. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Nothinghappened. 

 

Q: Allright. 

 

A: There was a huge crowd waiting for us at 
the Bahnhof in Berlin, this huge railroad 
station, uh newspapermen, camera people 
with the newsreels, uh photographers, 
fans, officials of all sorts, uniforms of
 all sorts.  Huge crowd waiting on the 
platform when we arri ved.  And as we 
uh got off the train and milled about on the 

platform I fe lt a tap on my shoulder.  And I turned and saw a smallish looking 

young ma n in his mi d Œ twenties obviously an
 American as soon as he talked to 
me , and he s a id to me  are you Marty Glickman.  I said yes.  He said you™re Jewish 

aren™t you.  I said yes I am.  Slightly ta
ken aback.  I said uh why do you ask.  He 
said well I™m Jewish also.  I said you
™re Jewish.  What are you doing here.  He 
said I™m going to me d school here in Ge
rmany.  I said you™re going to me d school 
here in Germany.  He said yes.  I coul
dn™t get into an American me d school.  So 
the feeling I had of Berlin being very mu
ch like New York in it™s anti Œ Semitism 

 
 
14

14
or it™s lack of anti Œ Semitism uh was sim
ilar to Ne w York and Berlin.  It was the 
same  sort of city, I thought, particularly 
as a result of this conversation with this 
young ma n going to me d school. 
 
Q: What did he tell you about the polit
ical climate in Germany as  a Jew? 
 

A: I asked him what it was like for you as a 
Jew here in Germany.  He says well in 
Berlin I go practically unnoticed.  No
body knows that I™m Jewish.  Uh I™m going 
to me d school here.  Uh in the shtete
ls, in the smaller cities around uh Germany 
uh there are problems.  But now during th
e Olympic game s and leading up to the 
Olympic games everything is, is, is quite. 
 Uh nothing seems to be going on in 
terms of anti Œ Semitism.   And as far as my being here in Berlin, I™m just like 

anybody else here in Berli
n.  I™m going to me d school. 
 

Q: All of these people who greeted you at 
the train station in Berlin, were they 
carrying swastikas, was there any of that? 
 

A: There was a huge numbe r of unifor med i
ndividuals.  I noticed and we commented 
about it, my teamma tes and I, about the fact that uh there seemed to be no me n 

under the age of approxima tely 35, no young me
n who were not in one uniform or 
another.  They were wearing either gr
ay, green or brown.  In one uniform or 
another.  No young me n in street clothes, 
in civilian attire, except those who were 
older than 35 or obviously older than uh th
e age that we athletes were.  Everyone 
seemed to be in uniform.  As for banners and flags, they were all over the place, 

domi nated by the swastika.  The swastika was all over.  On virtually every other 

banner we saw there was a swastika.  But th
is was ™36.  This was before we really 
got to know what the swastika truly meant.  This was two years before 

Kristallnacht .  This was three years before
 the outbreak of the war.  It was five 
years before the United States was involved 
in the war.  So the swastika and those 
uh German flags, the black and red and 
white of the German flags, did, didn™t 
mean very much to us except as a form of decoration. 
 

Q: And it wasn™t sort of an unnerving amount of patriotism? 

 

A: I™d never been asked about
 the patriotism exhibited by the Ge rmans at that time .  
Uh it was a, a, a natural thing to see uh 
all these Ge rman flags.  Uh but flags of 
other nations were exhibited as well.  Uh they rimme d the stadium.  They were on 

the streets.  There were ma ny flags.  Mos
tly German.  Most of those German flags 
were contained the swastika.  Uh there 
was seemed to be no outward display of 
patriotism except when Hitler walked into 
the stadium.  He would walk into his 
box overlooking the field and I was perhaps 50 to 75 feet away from Hitler™s box.  

And he™d walk in and the stands would 
rise and you™d hear it
 in unison.  Seig 

Heil.  Seig Heil.  All together, this huge
 sound reverberating through the stadium.  
That was the patriotism, t he German patrio
tism I saw.  Seig Heil, with a hundred 
and twenty thousand people shouting it, or most of the hundred and twenty 

thousand people.  But that same  shout 
of Seig Heil was ma tched by the sound of 

 
 
15

15
Jesse Owens name .  Ever y time Owe ns came on the track and he was on 
frequently because he ran in four 
different races, and qualifying times and 

qualifying races for all those races.  Ev
ery time Jesse appeared on the track the 
crowd would yell, Oo vens, Oo vens, the w in German is pronounced as a v.  And 

they would shout with the same  a mount 
of fervor it seemed for Jesse as they 
sounded for Seig Heil.  Oo vens.  Oo vens. 
 It wa s a rema rkable thing to see this 
ma rvelous black athlete saluted by a 
hundred and twenty thousand Germa ns. 
 

Q: That™s a great story.  Now when Owen
s wasn™t comi ng out on the field wa s there 
anything alarmi ng about this Seig Heil 
in unison, a hundred a
nd twenty thousand, 
or I don™t know how ma ny peopl
e were actually shouting it, but what seemed like 
the entire stadium?  
 

A: Uh, I never felt as though there was a
nything alarmi ng in terms of uh the Seig 
Heil, a feeling of fear or 
anything like that.   It wa s 
almost as though uh we in, in 
the States we re singing the National Anth
em or uh, uh stating uh the pledge of 
allegiance to our flag.  Uh it was uh it was fa
irly brief.  Hitler would walk in with 
an entourage of uh Goering and Goebbels and He ss and Himmler and Stryker and 

take their seats in this box w
ith Hitler in the mi ddle, slightly forward of the rest of 
the group, and Goering with his uh resple
ndent, outlandish uniforms  uh wildly 
decorative and Goebbels the rat like face 
and the rest uh Hess with a very dark 
beard that he  had.  Uh they, they sat there.  Uh and uh Hitler particular ly was 

extremely nervous when German athletes 
ran.  He ™d sit in his seat and rub his 
thighs and, and, and move back and 
forth as I™m doing now, and uh he was 
obviously very much involved in the race. 
 And he was, I thought he was nervous 
for his own athletes.  When other athletes
 comp eted, he just sat there uh quietly 
and observed.  Uh he was thrilled, overjoyed, smiled when uh German athletes 
went to the winning podium.  When the 
black athletes went to the winning 
podium, Hitler was gone.  As soon as th
e black athlete won his gold me dal and 
was going to the podium to receive it, 
the box would empty out, Hitler™s box 
would empt y out.  They™d all be gone and 
they would not pay homa ge to the great 
black athletes who were there.  They stay
ed for the white at hlet es.  But they left  

for the black athletes. 
 

 

(adjustments to Marty™s appearance) 

 

Q: I want to know a little bit about what it was like being in Germany, the Olympic 
village, what that was like?   Did you take 
little side trips into town or into other 
areas as a tourist?  If you can tell me 
a little bit about the mood before the 
Olympics. 
 

A: The event I was supposed to run, the 
400 me ter relay, was uh one of the last 
events in the track and fi eld program.  
It came, the trials came on the penultimate 

day and the final day of the game s for 
track and field was the final of the 400 
me ter run.  So uh I had plenty of time  and so did the other athletes, except fellows 

 
 
16

16
like uh Jesse Owens and uh one or two others who competed in several events, uh 
I had plenty of time to uh 
go into Berlin during the morning hours usually or late 
in the afternoon after the afternoon even
ts took pl ace and I uh had my freedom 
throughout Berlin.  I could hi
tch a ride if I chose to, get aboard a, a bus or a 
trolley, or whatever, because I was wear
ing a, an Olympic uniform and I  had 
Olympic identification of all sort s on me, 
and uh it, it was, it was beautiful, it was 
lovely.  Uh I walked along uh Unter 
der Linden uh I thought that Unter der 

Linden, later I went to Paris and walked
 along the Cha mps Elysee.  I believed 
then that  uh the Camps Elysee was not as attractive as Unter der Linden in Berlin 

but that was my own personal feeling about
 it.  Uh the Olympic village was a, a 
beautiful campus of bungalows and lo
w lying houses which uh housed the uh 

various teams of the Olympic game s.  Uh
 and it was like a college campus.  Uh 
slightly rolling hills, low hills and 
uh dotted with uh these bungalows and 

different buildings there.  There was a 
practice track, there was a swimmi ng area, 
uh an indoor natautorium, and uh we worked
 out at the practi
ce track.  The single 
most important thing I got from the game s 
was t he fact that the other athletes of 
the world we re just like me .  And I was 
just like they.  Uh I worked out with 
Hungarian athletes and uh, uh Roma nian 
athletes and Britis
h athletes, French, 
Japanese athletes.  We  had ma ny things
 in common.  The things involving our 
sports uh and uh I™d jog alongside of the diffe
rent athletes.  I walked alongside of 
them of the dining room and rooms but we
 were with each ot her and we enjoyed 
each other™s presence even though we c
ouldn™t communicate very well with most 

of the teams of the world because I di
dn™t speak their language and they didn™t 
speak mi ne.  Talked to the English, of 
course, and talked to those who spoke 
English.  Uh there was one Finn, a great Finnish athlete name d Gunnar Harkert.  

Uh Gunnar was uh the 5,000 me ter champi
on.  A young ma n in his early twenties 
who was a beautiful blond, blue Œ eyed, apple cheeked young ma n, and a great, 

great runner.  He won the gold me dal. And he spoke good English.  And we spent 

a great deal of time with Gunnar becaus
e he liked being with the American 
athletes.  He liked speaking English and 
we liked Gunnar.  And to my shock and 
horror, he wa s killed in the Russian Œ 
Finnish war just a few years after the 
Olympic games.  But knowing him a nd know
ing the other athletes, even just 
being with them for this limited amount of
 t i me ,  ma d e  me  fe e l
 like one of them.  
And I think they felt like one of us.  It wa
s a wonderful education for all of us and 
me  particularly. 
 

Q: Did you mi ngle with German athletes? 

 

A: The German athletes usua lly st ayed to 
themselves.  The German athletes worked 
out together.  Worked out by themselves.  
Uh they weren™t as free, as loose, as 

easy as athletes from othe
r countries of the world.

Q: You were saying that you had time before your event or your supposed event in 
the Olympics and you were able to go into 
Berlin and all that.  In this did you feel 
anything about the atmo sphere?   Wa s it ch
arged?  Did you see signs saying No 
Jews Here?   Did you experience 
any of what was to come? 
 

A: In my ti me  in Germany I  felt and saw nothing overt.  I saw no signs.  I heard no 
verbiage of any sort.  I speak a little 
German bec a use of the Yiddish that I know 
and I took some  Ger man at school.  Uh
 and I heard nothing and I saw nothing 
which was anti Œ Semitic in any way, except for the day that I was supposed to 

run the trial heats of the 
400 me ter relay.  And uh, uh that was the first anti and 
only anti Œ Semitism that I experi enced. 
 And I experienced it fr om American 
coaches and not fr om Germans.  There was no overt si gn of any anti Œ Semitic 

feeling or activity at all that I saw in 
Berlin or wherever I went in Germany. 
 

Q: Now Her ma n Goldberg your pal at the 
Olympics mentioned a trip into Berlin 
where I guess you hitched a ride with so
me  Ger man soldiers.  What happened 
there? 
 

A: One of the ways of getting from the  
Olympic village to the Olympic stadium 
which was about eight miles distant from th
e Olympic village was to hitch a ride.  
And uh Herman Goldberg, my buddy and I, 
hitched a ride in what amounts to a 
German Army jeep.  And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a 

Nazi sergeant and he sat 
alongside of his passenger who was a, a very handsome 

Lieutenant in the German army, blond, blue
 Œ eyed, most attractive looking ma n.  
And as we got into the jeep, hitching the 
ride, they asked for our autographs.  And 
we said we™ll give it to you when we get 
off the jeep.  Which we did.  Uh we took 
these uh eight miles at a what we thoughtwas a reckless speed to begin with.  We  

could see the speedometer going up to uh 70, 80, 90, 100.  100 kilome ters we 

finally realized and not a 
100 miles an hour, almost uh only half the speed.  At 
any rate we get to uh the Olympic stadium 
and uh they, they give us some  paper 
to sign our name s and we scrawled our name s, Herman Goldberg, Marty 

Glickman and left almost imme diately.  Uh
 we didn™t want them to have them ask 
questions about our name s, Goldberg, Glic
kman,  were we Jewish, or do we have 
German Jewish background or whatever.  We
 were aware of the fact that we were 
with this German Lieutenant uh and this
 German sergeant who looked every inch 
the typical Nazi Army 
officer and under officer. 
 

Q: So you knew that there wa
s potential for problems?  
 

A: We were aware of the fact that uh 
there was anti Œ Se mitism in Germany.  We 
were aware of the fact that these were 
obviously German sol diers, perhaps Nazis, 
but we thought all Germans 
uh all soldiers certainly uh 
were sympathetic to the 
Nazis.  And uh we just didn™t know what N
azism was.  Re me mber.  This is from 
the prospective of two years before Kris
tallnacht.  Uh the Holocaust was not only 
not a thought, it didn™t exist in our imagination, in our dreams uh we, we didn™t 

have nightma res about the Holocaust. It wa
s a word that I didn™t even know in 

 
 
18

18
1936.  Uh certainly had we uh any inkli
ng of what was going to happen, we 
wouldn™t have been in Ge rmany in the 
first pl ace.  But uh the uh, uh the feeling 
about anti Œ Se mitism for me  and probabl
y for Herman and the two other Jews 
who uh whom I knew uh on, on the team.  There was a, a fine basketball player 
name d Sa m Bolter who was on the team and Her man and I and uh, uh there was 

another Jewish athlete uh, uh who.  The 
Jewish athletes I knew on the team uh 
were Herma n Goldberg, who was my  buddy 
much of the time, and Sam Stoller 
who was team ma te on the 400 me ter rela
y, and Sa m Bolter was a, a wonderful 
basketball player, a guard on the basketball
 team and uh the four of us were the 
only Jews I was aware of.  I understand 
now there were three other Jews who 
were on the uh American Olympic team, but I didn™t know them then.  I didn™t 

know they were Jewish.  But the, the four 
of them I knew, the four of us were the 
Jews whom I knew.  And we certainly we
re not aware of what was to come .  I 
guess the whole world was not aware of, of wha t  was to come . 
 

Q: So Berlin was like any othe
r big city, but very beautiful. 
 

A: Berlin was like any other big city.  If 
I would use a single word to describe Berlin 
during that period of time. The word would be carnival.  There was an atmosphere 

of carnival about Berlin w
ith the flags flying and the 
beautiful weather, almost 
every day uh it was, it was golden.  Fl
eecy white clouds occasionally overhead.  

Late in the day, on a couple of days, there 
was some rain at the stadium.  But most 
of the time it was just lovely.  The city 
was imma culate as I understand it still is 
and as I saw a couple of years when I 
was back there again.  And uh the people 
were well dressed and seemingly well fed. 
 Uh the beer flowed and uh it was a 
carnival atmosphere. 
 

Q: Now before I get to, I want you to tell
 me  about how you were basically dumped 
from the race, but I just wanted to ask 
you on the boat or in the Olympic village, 

did you get to know John Woodruff at all? 
 

A: I knew John Woodruff uh slightly from 
the various track meets in which we 
competed at the same  time.  He ran the half mile.  I was the sprinter running a 100 

me ters and some times 200 me ters.  And John and I were among the younger 

me mbers of the team.  Uh John was a, a uh 
a wonder athlete.  He was taller than 
virtually anyone else on the, on the squad 
except for some basketball players, six 
feet four, a quiet, reserved, 
and a magnificent runner.  
He had the longest stride, 

running stride, in the world at that time . 
 And he ran a ma rvelous race to win the 
gold me dal at 800 me ters.  He was far bett
er than the rest of the field as you 
probably know and have seen, he virtually 
came  to a halt at the half Œ way ma rk 
of the race, at the end of th
e first quarter, let the rest 
of the field go by because he 
was pocketed in.  He couldn™t get to th
e outside.  He couldn™t ma ke a mo ve 
because there were runners in front of hi
m and along side of him, so he let the 
field go by him, ran around the entire fiel
d and then came on to win handily down 
the stretch anddown the backstretch fi
rst, around the far turn and around the 

stretch, and uh, a quiet, self Œ effaci
ng, and a uh just a wonderful athlete.

Q: Now tell me  about your anticipation for 
your event.  I know you were training for 
it, and what happened? 
 

A: The 400 me t e r relay was selected before
hand and the four of us in order, Sa m 
Stoller would start, he had the best start of the group of us.  I was to run the 

second leg down the back stretch strai
ghtway.  Floyd Draper run the third leg.  
And Frank Wycoff run the anchor leg.  He
 was the great veteran.  This was his 

third Olympic team that he was on.  A
nd we practiced passing the baton and 
passing the baton is terribly important in 
the 400 meter relay because the race is 

short and you to ma ke a, a, a good pass, th
e best possible pass.  And we practiced 
this every day.  In that order.  So 
that we knew each other and we knew the 
distance we had to start running and things
 like that.  The morning of the day we 
were supposed to run in the trial heats, 
we were called into a meeting, the seven 
sprinters were, along with Gene Cromwell,
 the assistant head
 track coach, and 
Lawrence Robertson, the head track co
ach.  And Robertson announced to the 
seven of us that he™s heard very strong 
rumors that the Germans were saving their 
best sprinters, hiding them, to upset the American team in the 400 me ter relay.  

And consequently, Sam and I were to 
be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph 
Metcalfe.  Now there™s no question that Je
sse and Ralph were faster at 100 me ters 
than Sam and I.  They™d beaten us fairly
 regularly.  And we were shocked.  Uh 
Sa m was completely stunned.  He didn™t sa
y a word in the meeting.  I™m a brash 
18 year old kid and I said coach, you can™t hi
de world class sprint
ers.  In order to 
be a world class sprinter you must run in
 world class competition.  And we don™t 
know of any Germans outside of Erik Bo
rkma ier who finished fifth in the 100 
me ter final beaten by Frank Wycoff, th
e, as well as Jesse Owens and Ralph 
Metcalfe.  He was the best German sprinter.  Later I beat Borkamier in another 

post Olympic track meet, but we all kne
w we could beat Borkma ier, and you 
don™t hide world class sprinters.  I said
 coach there can™t be any German world 
class sprint ers.  He says well we™re 
going to take no chances, said Dean 
Cromwell.  And Jesse and Ralph are goingto take Sam pla, Sam™ s place and your 

place.  At which point  Jesse spoke up and said coach I™ve won my three gold 

me dals, the 100, the 200, and the long jum
p.  I™ m tired.  I™ve 
had it.  Let Marty 
and Sam run.  They deserve it, said Je
sse.  And Cromwell pointed his finger at 
him and said you™ll do as you™re told.  And in
 those days black athletes did as they 
were told.  And Jesse was  quiet after that
.  But he volunteered not to run, not to 
win his fourth gold me da l so that Sam a
nd I, the only two Jews on the track team, 
could run and win or try to 
win.  The only way we could ha
ve lost that race is had 
we dropped the baton.  Fr ank Wycoff  later said that uh we probably would have 

run just as fast because our baton passing would have 
been superior because we 

had practiced.  I spoke up, I said some th
ing else, I said coach no ma tter who runs 
we™re going to win this race by fifteen yard
s.  We  won by fift een yards.  When 
you see the fi nish of the race,
 all you see is Frank Wycoff 
crossing the finish line.   
You don™t even see the next, second place finisher.  He™s out of the pictur e.  He™s 

that far back.  Fifteen yards behind.  Th
e Germans didn™t finish second or third.  

They finished fourth.  They were placed 
third because the Dutch team ran out of 

 
 
20

20
their lane and so they were 
disqualified.  But they finish
ed third in the race some 
fifteen, sixteen yards back.  So the stor
y given us was an out and out lie by 
Robertson and by Dean Cromwell.  I belie
ve now that with Hitler™s humiliation 
by having the black athletes stand on 
the winning podium the many ti mes that 
they did in the 100, the 200, the 400, the 
800, the long jump, the high jump.  They 
were dominating the games.  That it w
ould have been further humiliation for 

Hitler to have  Jews stand on the winning podium.  And as I said the only wa y we 

would not stand on the winning podium ha
d we dropped the baton.  We  would 
have won the race by, by fifteen yards or
 more.  So we didn™t get to run. 
 

Q: Now you say now this is the way you look at
 it. Try to put your
self back to this 
time in the summer of 1936 as you were
 told that you weren™t going to be 

running.  What was going through your 
mi nd?   What were you thinking? 
 

A: As I was told that Sam and I would not 
run I thought that tr
ack politics was taking 
place, that uh Dean Cromwell, the assist
ant head track coach, wanted to make 
sure that both his boys, Fl oyd Draper and 
Frank Wycoff wer e  on the team.  And 
so he was making sure they were going 
to be on because in a trial race in the 

Olympic village three days before this
 race took pl ace, the 400 meter race took 
place, we ran a trial heat.  And Stolle
r won the race, beating me  by about  oh a 
shoulder, a foot, and we both beat Floyd Dr
aper by a yard.  So here is Draper 
running the relay, whom we had both beaten 
just a couple of days before and Sam 
and I were not running.  In the entire hi
story of the modern Ol ympic game s, now 
going into it™s 100
th
 year, no fit American track and field performe r has ever not 
competed in the Olympic game s except for Sam Stoller and me , the only two 

Jews on the 1936 team.  Every other Am
erican track and field athlete has 
competed, so long as he was physically f
it, didn™t have a pulled muscle or didn™t 
have an appendectomy as one of our track
 athletes did have
 and couldn™t run, a 
fellow name d Hal Smallwood.  But with th
at exception uh every 
athlete has run. 
 

Q: Okay.  But you didn™t.  I mean you weren™
t thinking in those terms in August of 
™36.  You were thinking it wa
s basically favoritism again. 
 

A: In August of ™36 I thoughtoriginally, I did me ntion in 
that meeting I did say that 
coach you know we™re the only two Jews on 
the track team, Sa m and I.  There™s 
bound to be a furor about this back home .  
We ™ll worry about that later said Dean 

Cromwell.  Later, of course, Dean Crom
well also was a me mber of the American 
First committee, that gr oup in America whic
h was sympathetic to the Nazi cause.  

So my thoughts were that Cromwell was s
eeing to it that his boys were on that 
400 me ter relay.  And uh about that threat of
 other German sprinters that was just 
uh had a whole cloth.  It, it,
 it was a co mplete lie. 
 

Q: What were you feeling?   Here you had b
een preparing for this in a way for years 
and you™d been training especially hard, you 
were, I™m sure, very, very excited to 
participat e in the Olympics. 
 

 
 
21

21
A: I was fortunate.  I was young.  I was 18. 
 Sa m was three years older than I.  He 
was a senior at Michigan.  And uh in t
hose days when you finished your college 
career that was usually it.  And Sam was 
at the end of his college career.  He 
vowed never to run again because of this 
terrible disappoint ment
.  He did run and 
won a collegiate championship the following 
year.  He did change his mi nd a bit 
later on.  I as an 18 year old, just out of
 my freshman year, I vowed that come 
1940, I™d win it all.  I™d win the 100, th
e 200, I™d uh run on the relay.  I wa s going 
to be 22 in 1940 and I™d be at the height
 of my supposed uh athletic abilities in 
those years. Of course 1940 never came . 
 There was a war on.  1944 never came.  
But I was frustrated and angered enough so
 that I could look ahead and get even 
four years hence.  Young enough to get eve
n.  In addition I wa s a football player 
uh at Syracuse and uh a month from the 
Olympic game s I wa s going to be playing 
football at Syracuse University, my fi
rst varsity season then.  And uh I had 
some thing to look forward to.  I had some
thing to dissipate my disappointme nt by 
having a, a football season too, looming for me . 
 

Q: So you weren™t even tem
porarily devastated by this? 
 

A: I was, I was, I was not if you use the wo
rd devastated, I was not devastated.  I was 
angered.  I was frustrated.  And as 
I say I was young enough to think ahead. 
 

Q: Say that again w
ithout the as I say. 
 

A: I was not devastated by not being on 
that 400 me ter team.  Te rribly angry.  
Terribly frustrated.  But I was young enough to
 be able to look ahead to 1940 and 
perhaps win it all, to win the 100 and the 
200.  I mi ght be at my athletic peak 
when I was 22 years of age.  Here I was only 18.  So I had some thing to shoot for, 

some thing to look forward to, come  1940 and the next Olympic game s.  I also had 

a football season I was looking forwar
d to because I was going into my 
sophomore year, first year of varsity foot
ball, and that occupied my thoughts and 
time and energies immediately after the games. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that Owens stepped forw
ard and said, let these guys run.  Did you 
get that kind of support from the other athletes? 
 

A: No one else said anything
 in that room during the course of this me eting.  Ralph 
Metcalfe didn™t say a word.  I think he
 wanted to run on the relay and this 

justification, why, why not,
 if he could run on the relay.  And the only other 
athlete involved who didn™t run was M
ac Robinson.  Mac, Jackie Robinson™s 
older brother, already had won the silver me dal at 200 me ters and he was not as 

good at 100 me ters as he was at 200 me ters. 
 In addition he  was not involved in 

the practice of passing the ba
ton.  That 400 me ter relay was set as I say with uh 
leading off was Sam Stoller with that gr
eat start.  I was running the second leg, 
Floyd Draper the third leg, Frank Wy coff th
e anchor leg and we practiced passing 
the baton in that or der for tw
o weeks in the Olympic village. 
 

 
 
22

22
Q: Did the other athletes after this decisi
on had been ma de, were they supportive or 
did they or did you guys ju
st not talk about it? 
 
A: They were supportive.  The other athlet
es were supportive afterwards.  Uh patted 
me  on the back.  Say, saying Marty you s
hould have run.  Uh not en ma sse.  
Everybody was involved with his own uh achieveme nts or striding.  Uh the, the 

feeling was that tough luck.  But for me , 
as I say, it was the f
eeling of I™ll show 
them.  I™ll get even.  I was there.  I sat 
in the stands and watched the race.  The 
qualifying heats proved that we were 
by far the best team a mong the other 
countries of the world, the best 400 me te
r relay team.  The following day I was 
walking across the campus of the Olympic village and I hear d my name called to 

me , and 50 yards away was Lawrence Robe
rtson, the head track coach, uh with 
his cane.  He  was an older ma n.  Marty, Ma
rty.  And I jogged over to him.   I just 
want to tell you how sorry I am.  I made a 
terrible mi stake.  And uh he said he 
was sorry.  Dean Cromwell didn™t say a wo
rd.  Never spoke to me  again.  Uh I 
don™t know what he said or thought to anyone
 else, but he never said a word to 
me .  Wycoff later said we would have 
run just as fast had you and Sam run 
because our superior  baton passing because 
of practice could have enabled us to 
run and win. 
 

Q: Now you started to say you were there wa
tching your meet.  What was that like? 
 

A: Watching the trial heat 
and watching the final the 
following day were uh strange, 
weird, all sorts of emotions flashed thr
ough my be ing.  Uh frustration certainly.  
Anger certainly.  I look out on the track 
and I see Metcalfe passing runners down 
the backstretch.  He ran the second leg.  And 
that should be me out there.  As they 
warmed up, jogging up and down the track, I, 
that should be me .  That, that™s me  
out there.  And you know frustrated at it 
uh feeling uh also fee
ling relief that I 
wasn™t running in this race.
  I didn™t have the pressu
re of receiving the baton, 
running with it and passing the baton.  I 
wasn™t fearful of dropping the baton.  
And all relay runners have that
 uncertainty, that 
fear of the possibility.  I™ve never 
dropped a baton in the many relay races I™ve
 run, but I™ve seen it dr opped.  So I it 

was some  fe eling of relief, 
but mostly it was anger and frustration and the feeling 
that should be me  out there. 
 

Q: Who were you sitting with during the event? 

 

A: My recollection is I sat with Herman Go
ldberg uh during the events for either the 
trial race or the trial heats or for the 
finals.  I don™t know.  
I don™t believe I sat 
with Herma n both those days.  Very ofte
n we would sit together and sometimes 
we would not.  After all he had his own 
assignments to take care of.  He was 
practicing and playing with 
the American baseball team.  But I do believe that for 
one of those races either the trial heat or
 in the final that Herman was alongside 
me .  
 

Q: Did you talk about what was going on? 

 
 
23

23
 
A: No.  I uh I didn™t say a word.  Words 
can™t convey how you feel.  Not at the 
mome nt anyhow.  Uh words wouldn™t have 
ma de me  feel any better or less angry.  
I uh I just sat there and uh suffered or ju
st felt.  I felt all these emotions.  And 
again at the age of 18, the world is bright
 and glorious in front of you.  I was a 
good athlete.  I knew that.  And uh four 
years hence I was going to be out there 
again. 
 

Q: Now when t he American team did win and went up to the podium to receive their 
honors, were you proud for them, were you happy for them?  
 

A: When the American team was on the podium, I was not necessarily proud for 
them.  I was  pleased, of course, that they
 won, and I was particularly pleased that 
they won by fifteen yards to prove th
e point that uh anyone, anyone of the 
American uh sprinters could have won onthe, run on the relay and won the event 

handily.  But we, I don™t feel as though uh I 
was an American athlete,  or that I 
was a Jewish athlete.  I was an athlete.  
I was a, a me mber of the Olympic team.  I 
was in the Ol ympic stadium.  Uh I was pa
rt of this overall 
thing, which I believe 
has done me  so much good in all the years which follow, 60 years now, which 

have followed those ™36 game s.  Where I be
gan to realize that I™m just like the 
other athletes of the world, the other people 
of the world and they™re just like me .  
We™re all alike.  We ™re all brothers.  
And uh the whole point of the game s , the 
whole point of all athl etic competition is 
to learn to respect each other, to like 

each other, to love each other, to get to 
really know each other.  And I was part of 
that.  And I was also angry. 
 
Q: Were you envious? 
 

A: I don™t think I was envious?   I uh. 
 The only feeling I have today, I™m a 
grandfather of 10, and I™m the great Œ gr
andfather of 4.  So I don™t have the 
grandchildren or the great Œ grandchildrenI can show this gold me dal to.  That™s 

the only feeling of disappointme nt I now ha
ve, that I can™t show my grandchildren 
this gold Olympic me da l.  That™s the onl
y, the only feeling I 
have now.  I think 
it™s wonderful that I was on the team.  I think 
it™s great that I ma de
 this trip.  Uh it 
exposed me  to, to ma rvelous things.  A nd also exposed me  to the hurt of anti Œ 

Semitism. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you can tell me 
about what it was like, not necessarily for 
your competition in particular, but just 
what it was like be ing in the Olympic 

stadium?   Ca n you describe it? 
 

A: The Olympi c stadium itself is a very impressive pl ace.  Uh it™s a, it was 
particularly impressive then when f
illed with a hundred and twenty thousand 
people and it was virtually 
brand new.  And I™ll never 
forget walking into the 
stadium, ma rching in along with my 
American teammates in the opening day 
parade.  And I use the word ma rch loosely here because Ame r ican athletes don™t 

 
 
24

24
ma rch very well.  We  kind of sclumped in
 you know in line but ah walking in the 
ma nner of loose Œ limbed, uh easy going American athletes.  And I reme mber 

looking up at Adolph Hitler as we walk
ed by, ma rched by, and he was glaring 
down at us we thought.  And the comment hear
d in the ranks and I said it also, he 
looks just like Charlie Chaplin.  And that™s just the way we felt about him.  He 

was almost a comi c figure with hi s dr a
b, khaki uniform he wore, khaki shirt and 
khaki pants.  No decorations on it.  Th
at funny little mousta
che and the cowlick 
over his forehead and uh he was a comi c fi
gure.  Uh I thought of hi m and I think 
ma ny of us thought of him as like a typi
cal South American dictator of those 
years who was here today and gone tomorrow.
  After all he™d just been in power 
some  two and a half years and who knew 
how long he was going to last or how 

much power he would ultimately have. But uh he was comi c to us.  Uh along with 

the rest of his entourage 
and uh certainly they were 
funny looking in terms of uh 
Goering and his uniform and Goebbels w
ith his rat like face and some  of the 
diplomats in their with their long frock 
coats and ascots and uh, uh some  of the 
Ar my uniforms and Naval uniforms around them.  So uh it was uh it was uh an 

experience I™ m pleased to have be a part 
of.  And of I™m still angry at not having 
that me dal to show the kids. 
 

Q: Was there something awesome about ma
rching in with a hundred thousand people 
sitting there? 
 

A: We felt no feeling of awe.  We  
were cocky, young, uh well Œ trained, uh good 
athletes.  And uh nothing awesome a bout 
going into a huge stadium.  We ™ d been 
in huge stadiums before.  We ™d comp eted 
in these huge stadiums .  Uh the ha the 
thing I reme mber, one of the things I reme
mber most, was as part of the opening 
ceremonies these thousands of pigeons
 which had been kept in cages 
 
Q: I need to stop you here cause the tapes– 

 

(end of Tape 3 of 4) 

 

(Tape 4 of 4)  

 

Q: When we stopped you were describing wh
at it was like being in the Olympic 
stadium, the pageantry. 
 

A: The opening day parade.  One of the th
ings I, I best reme mber about the uh, uh 
the opening day ceremonies of the Olympic 
game s was standing in the infield of 
the stadium while the Olympic oath wa
s being taken and uh the various music 
was being played, was the release of thes
e thousands of pigeons which had been 
cooped up and they were all, alongside the 
inner perime ter of the stadium.  And 

now after being in these 
cages for I don™t know how ma ny hours or how ma ny 
days, they we re suddenly released and th
ey flew up over the stadium and circled 

round and round.  And we began to hear on 
our straw hats that was part of our 
uniform, the straw hats, splat, splat, splat 
from these pigeons.  And we we re afraid 

 
 
25

25
to look up of course or else we™d get it in
 the eye.  But there we were cringing in 
the stadium and the splat, 
splat of all these thousands
 of pigeons going round and 
round and finally they went far enough up 
to get out of the stadium and fl ew 
away.  It was a very funny mo me nt. 
 
Q: Do you remember.  We r e  
you at the closing ceremonies? 
 

A: No.  We , we  left before the end of
 the Olympic game s.  Aver y Brundage I 
believe, the head of the American Ol
ympic committee, was the basic reason, I 
believe that Sa m and I didn™t get to run in
 the Olympic game s.  Adolph Hitler was 
being humiliated by the great success of the 
black American athlet es and I think 
that he wanted to see to it that Jewish
 athletes didn™t st
and on the winning podium 
and further humiliate Adolph Hitler, em
barrass him with that nonsense about 
Aryan supremacy because here were the 
great black athl etes who couldn™t  be 
kept off the winning podium because of thei
r number and their great reputations.  
And they were ma rvelous.  But here were
 two rather obscure Jewish Ame r ican 
athletes who could be kept from the 
winning podium and I believe that Avery 
Brundage who was close to Hitler, who had examined Germany for anti Œ 

Semitism the year before to see whet her or not the games should be held in 

Germany.  Here was Avery Brundage keep
ing Jews from the winning podium so 
as not to further embarrass Adolph Hitler. 
 

Q: This was some thing th
at you realized later. 
 

A: I was, I was more aware of it later than 
I am.  I was more aware of it later uh than 
I was at that time.  But uh Brundage was 
a most important figure.  Head of the 
American Olympic Committee and later on 
the pr esident of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
 
Q: You me ntioned you had wanted, or were 
thinking forward to the 1940 Olympics.  
So apparently this experience didn™t 
sour you at all on sports, or fairness, 
Olympics. 
 

A; My experience in the Olympic game s and th
e fact that I didn™t 
run didn™t sour me  
on the game s at all.  It soured me  on Av
ery Brundage.  It certainly soured me  on 

anti Œ Semitism and the Nazis as well. But as far as the Olympic game s then and 

for ma ny years thereafter, I was an Olym
pic uh booster.  I didn™t want us to 
boycott the game s in the Soviet Union in 
1980.  I didn™t want the Soviet Union to 
boycott the American games in 1984.  But 
I™m not very happy with the current 
Olympic games.  The Olympic ga mes of 
™96 and the enormous commer cialization 
of the Olympic game s.  I think that th
e Olympic ideal, the Olympic creed, doesn™t 
exist any longer.  It™s all st
rictly professionalism.  I th
ink that the current Olympic 
game s in Atlanta is a huge project 
for profit and that™s about all. 
 

Q: At what point after the game s did you 
become  more aware of what was actually 
taking pl ace in Germany and in Europe? 

 
 
26

26
 
A: I became aware of what took place in
 Germany in 1938, Kristallnacht was the 
beginning of the knowledge generally of
 what took place in Germany.  I n 1936 
even the German Jews st ayed in Germany until 1938.  Many left but far more 

remained in Germany until ™38 and then they
 st arted to try to get out of Germany.  
Of course, I didn™t know about uh the Holo
caust until after the war was over.  I 
was a, a marine in the, in the central
 Pacific during World 
War II on the Marshall 
Islands and uh the European campaign was 
that far distant fro
m our involvement 
in the Pacific.  So it wasn™t until I came  
back in December of ™45 that I began to 
realize, began to hear and 
know of what took place in the years, the closing years 
of World War II 
 

Q: Did you rethink at all about your partic
ipation in 1936/  I mean when you started 
learning mu ch more, did it ma ke you 
think about it all in context? 
 

A: I™ve been asked ma ny times whethe
r I have second guesses about going to 
Germany in 1936 and uh I persist in saying 
that I™m delighted I went.  Uh I™m 
glad that the game s took place in 1936.   Uh I saw no harm from the game s  

themselves.  I saw a great deal of good fr
om the games.  For me as an individual 
learning about the other athletes of the 
world and for the great success of the non 
Œ Aryan athletes, the ma rvelous black at
hletes who had this great success in 
helping smash that myth of Aryan supremacy.  I think that was a very positive 

thing. 
 

Q: Did you afterwards think more about be
ing a Jewish athlete?   I mean did it, 
because in fact that seems to be what
 happened in 1936 even though prior to that 
you never considered yourself a Je
wish athlete.  You were one. 
 

A: Some thing took place in 1937 which uh was 
a direct result of what happene d to 
me  in 1936.  I was playing football at Syracu
se and uh for this particular I was the 
star of the team.  We had upset Cornell 
the week before and uh I had uh scored 
both touchdowns for Syracuse against Corn
ell 14 to 6 was the final score.  And 
I™d had the best day I ever had on the f
ootball field.  Lot of publicity about me  
then.  And uh I™m e mbarrassed almo st to say 
it, I was the star of the team going to 
a game against Maryland, in Baltimore.  And as we™re getting dressed for the 

game sitting alongside of me is the other st arting half Œ back.  His name is 

Wi l moth Se dette Si ng.  He is a black 
ma n but his mother ma rried a Hindu  
physician and Will and I played si de by side. 
  We™re in the sa me  class.  We took 
classes together.  He helped me  through 
my physics class, my physics course.  
Later he was a me mber of the uh the black
 airmen, the black squadron who helped 
for m uh the one squadron of black aviators in World Wa r II.  But this was in 

Baltimore, Maryland.  We™re being dresse
d for the game .  He™s sitting right 

alongside of me , right here.  
He slept alongside of me  wher
e we slept in the, in the 
gym during the football season.  And th
e coach came in, Os sie Solom along with 
the Director of Athletics L
ou Andreas and he said uh fellows I™ve got some  ne ws.  
Uh the local press and Maryland had just found out that Will is not a  Hindu but 

 
 
27

27
he™s a black ma n and consequently he w
on™t play today.  And I said to myself 
sitting there, stand up Marty and say if Will doesn™t play, I don™t play.  And I™m 
one of the leaders of the team.  I™m t h
e star of the team, this week anyhow 
because of that previous game  the week before.  And I say stand up and sa y that.  

And I think to myself, but 
if I do stand up and say that
 and the game  is cancelled 
and there™s ruckus or this furor develops 
as a result of the ga
me  being cancelled, if 
that happens they™ll point to me  and th
ere™s that Jewish guy getting in trouble 

again.  Because just the year before I™
d been involved in the anti Œ Semitic 
incident  in Berlin.  And so I didn™t sa y a word.  And Will didn™t play.  And I 

played.  And we got beat.  We  got beat 
twelve nothing.  A couple of years after 
that, Will was killed in World War II and to
 this day I still feel very st rongly 
about it.  That I should have gotten up and said and he was good enough to die for 

our country, but he wasn™t good e
nough to play against Maryland. 
 

Q: I want to ask you one more quest
ion.  (Straighten jacket and tie0 
 

A: After the Olympic game s uh many of the 
track and field athlet
es toured Europe 
and several different track meets.  I ra
n on a 400 yard relay team in London at 
White City Stadium.  I ran with Jess
e Owens and Ralph Metcalfe and Frank 
Wycoff and me .  We set a world™s record 
at 400 yards.  That world™s record still 
stands.  Mostly because they rarely ru
n that race and they don™t run yards any 
more they now run me ters.  So um the four
 of us are still world record holders at 
the 400 yard relay. I also ra
n in Paris after the uh Olympic games.  Ran against 
Frank Wycoff and uh I won the race 
against Wy coff that day and uh a 

combination of uh Japanese and French at
hletes as well as American athletes 

competed that day.  And I won that race.
  Also ran in Scotland.  I ran in a 
handicap race and uh didn™t wi
n that handicap race.  Uh I was set back so fa r from 
the rest of the field because these werelocal athl etes in uh in Edinburgh, Scotland, 

that uh I was literally off the track, uh th
at far back, and had to run up a slight 
incline to get to the track and then start running.  I finished out of the mone y. 
 

Q: So I think what you™re telling me  fromthose first few races is that you pr obably 
were good enough to run in the Olympics. 
 

A: Well, I, I was on the team. 

 

Q: But to have actually competed 
instead of all that stuff you were– 
 

A: Do you want me  to say that. 

 

Q: Sure. All of a sudden a few weeks af
ter the Olympics, you™re ma king a world 
record in the same  event. 
 

A: I don™t want to brag.  I mean it™s been 
said.  I, I was on the team.  That™s the 
important thing.  I made the team an
d the obviously I was good enough to be uh 
to run in the Olympic games because 
I was on the American team.  And uh 

 
 
28

28
American athletes comp ete in the Olym
pic game s when they make the Olympic 
team, except for these two Jewish athlet
es who didn™t because of Avery Brundage 
and Adolph Hitler and anti Œ Semitism.  A
nd I™d like to add one other thing that 
some ti me s people feel sorry for me  and what happened to me  in, in Germany, in 
Berlin, in 1936.  What happened to me wa
s as nothing, absolutely zero to that 
which took place later on.  There™s ju
st no feeling of uh comparison and no 
feeling of, of hurt.  Uh there™s still fee
ling of anger, but uh I was there and uh that 
mattered.  What took place was much, much more important afterwards. 
 

Q: I think I have one more question.  
You me ntioned this race in Maryland. 
 

A: The football game  in Maryland. 

 

Q: Right.  I™m sorry.  The football game .  
And the fact that you were very conflicted 
about standing up for this black Indian at
hlete.  Ha ve you thought about ways in 
which your experience from the 1936 Olympics impacted you or shaped you in 

terms of values or choices you ma de  af
terwards.  I know it™s a fairly broad 
question, but. 
 

A: I think my experience in 1936, my experien
ce in athletics genera
lly specifically in 
™36 ma de me aware of the fact that I am
 not different than other people of the 
world.  I am not different than blacks or br
owns or yellows or whites.  That we™re 
all one.  And uh I think I™ve learne d not 
to be tolerant necessarily because 
tolerance I think implies sort of a uh a 
superiority over individuals.  But I™ve 
learned to appreciate other people I think 
because of my experi
ence in ™36 and my 
experience in athletics. 
 

Q: Did it make you more vigilant  toward racism, anti Œ Semitism, discrimi nation? 

 

A: I think the experience of a
ll at hlet esmakes me more c
onscious of other people, of 
bias and prejudice against uh Black and Asia
tics and Latins and Jews.  I think that 
we™re people.  I™ve learned that through sports
.  I think that at ev
ery level of sports 
from my da ys as a schoolboy to my days
 as a broadcaster has enabled me  to 
thoroughly enjoy and appreciate 
the abilities of the greatathletes. I was able to 
look at and broadcast about.  The Jim Brow
ns.  The wonderful Black athletes, the 
wonderful Japanese athletes
, uh the great athletes of 
the world uh regardless of 
what their background was. 
 

Q: Sportsisth
e great equalizer. 
 

A: Sports is the great equali
zer.  The fellow who gets to the finish line first is the 
winner.  Uh brings to mi nd another thought that uh the Olympic game s should be 

uh a competition amongst indivi duals 
and not amongst teams because teams 
represent nationalities.  I
ndividuals represent themselves.  Even though we wore 

the uniform of the United States Olympic 
Team, we ran as individuals.  For the 
relay, the relay is a unique track and fiel
d event, four me n running together but 

 
 
29

29
running individually together.  Uh bask
etball and hockey, great
 sports, they™re 
wonderful sports, and football too, of cour
se, but the, the point of sports is the 
exultation the individual athl
ete feels when he does it by himself.  And that™s the 
point of the Olympic games.  Tea m spor
ts are marvelous.  They teach all the 
things that ought to be ta
ught in terms of team work and cooperation and practice 
and respect for the other team and all that.  But uh, the Olympic game s are for the 
individual and for the exto
lling of the individual abilities, the excellence of the 
individual rather than 
the nation or the team. 
 

Q: Thank you.  Is there anything else you want to add? 

 

A: I want to say hello to Margaret. 

 

Q: Okay.  Thank you.
