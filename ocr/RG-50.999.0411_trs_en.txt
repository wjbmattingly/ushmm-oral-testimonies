Halina Litm an was born in Krakow, Poland, on Decem ber 12, 1932. 
Poland is to the right of Germany on this mapof  Europe. T he arrow on this

Af ter the war, Halinaand herf am ily im m igrated to England.  
 
 
Halina lives in Bethesda, Maryland.  Herhusband Richard passed 
away in 2011. She has two sons, oneof  whom  lives in England, the other 
just 10 m inutes away, as Halinanotes.  Halina has two granddaughters.  
Hannah, 16,and Olivia, 9.  I might mention Hannah is studying film producing 
and isproducing af ilm about Halina at this very m om ent.  
 
 
Halinaf requently travels to England to see her son andher sisterand 
herf am ily.  In April 2011 Halinaand som eof  the other survi vors f rom her
 
hometown in Poland,which is now in the Ukraine, wentthere toplace a 

m onum ent on an unmarked grave in which 800 Jews were buried during the 
f irst Germ an action in that town. W e're going to hear about thata little bit 
la te r.  
 
 
She continuesher keen interest in sports, which have been a 
particular importance in her lif e, because herm other was the Polish 
swim m ing champion in 1925.  
 
 
Later this year, Halina will travel to Poland tovisit an exhibit of  Jewish 
athletes inKrakow.  The exhibit includes herm other. She will also visit her 
fam ily in England and Israel.  
 
 
Halina speaksf requently about her experience during the Holocaust at 
schoolsandhere atthe museum and other settings.  Next week, she will

W ith  th a t,  I ' d 
like toask you to join me in welcom ing our

Halina Peabody.  
 
[Applause]
 
Halina, thank you somuch for joining us today, being our 
F i rst P e rso n
.   W e' r e 
really glad tohave you here with us. 
 
 
W ehave som uchf or you to cover in a short period, so we'll just get 
started rightaway.  Yo u told me when wef irst m et, in your early years before 
war broke outthat life was beautif ulfor you. W hen war began,of  course, it 
all changed, inSeptember 1939.  Let's start with you telling us aboutth
e 
prewar years, about yourfam ily, your com m unity, your lif e bef orethe war 
began.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e lived in a very lo vel y little place called Zaleszczyki, 
which was a seaside,notactually a ri verside town.  Thattown is almost 
com pletely surrounded by the river Dniester.  In 1939, it was a national

f rontier with Romania. Sincem y m other was a swim m ing cham pion, she 
loved the water. She used to water ski there.W eused to go paddling 
around in canoes. It was a lovely, lovel y place tobe in.  
 
 
In the wintertim e, it was ver y, ver y cold, though, and so we used todo 
winter sports.  My m other was also a skier and could danceon skates.  She 
did everything.  By the age of 5, Ialready skated.  Really, I remember.  
 
 
So this was 
--
 
she did a lot that
 
way.  Also, my f ather taughtm e to 
read bef ore the war, before I went to school. Being thef irst,he wantedm e to 

be the genius.  He insisted I should read thenewspaper.  
 
 
I don't rem em ber anything of  that.  As long as I can remember,I could 
a l wa y s  re
ad Polish, and write.  So this was som ething that Iam not aware of .  
 
 
My m other, on the other hand, was alsoa wonderf ul knitterand used 
to do wonderf ul lace. Ever ything at hom e was m adeby her.  She was 
teaching m eembroidery.  I rem em ber em broidering
 
a little handkerchief  for 
m y grandm other inKrakow.  
 

 
And we had bicycles, tricycles, we had everyt hing that was available.  
 
 
T hen,as I said, life was beautif ul.  My f atherwas a dentist.  He 
practiced, surgery, in thef ront of the house. W ehad ahouse. In the back, 
we li ved.  All m y m other's work was m e.  Shelooked af ter me. Sheusedto 
knitf orm y Shirley T emple doll. T hat I rem ember. T hat was beautiful.  That 
all came to an end suddenly in 1939.

>> Bill Benson:  Halina, did youhave a large 
extended f am ily?  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, yes. W ehad quite a large extendedf amily, but 
they were all in Krakow, inWarsaw. W e were the only ones in Zaleszc zyki.  
T hat was the reason,m y f ather was a young starting dentist, wanted tof ind a 
place to start anew there.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Germany invades PolandSeptem ber1,1939. Soon af ter, 

the Russians, in their agreem ent with Germ any, attack Poland.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e knew in 1939,September, when we knew that the 

b e lls we n t off, tha t it wa s th
e Russians we we re expecting.  Because m en 
were very af raid of being conscripted into the Russianarm y, which was 20 

years, they couldn't get out. T hey based them selves onthef irst world war.  
A lot of them  wanted to run away.  
 
 
W ehad really nowhere to
 
go,and the problem  was always that m y 
sister was born two m onthsbefore the war.  So we hada baby at hom e.  
 
 
A lot of people just grabbed whatever they could and ran the bridgeto 
Rom ania.  Myf atherf elt it was better that we stay at hom e.  So he went
 
over 
by him self ,and with lots of  otherpeople,andwe stayed alone.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T here was the belief, part of that was, because they thought 

only m en wouldbeat risk.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You'd be safe?

>> 
Halina Peabody: That's what he thought. He didn't think we wer e in any 
danger. W hen the Russians occupied us, we just carried on as we were, 
m other andtwo children.  After two, three weeks, Idon't know how m any 
weeks it was, but everything was f rozen over, and people who ran to 
Rom ania and lef tfam ilies and businesses decided that perhapstheycould 
com e back, thatm aybe it wasn't going to beso terrible. 
 
 
Som y f ather,along with a few others, tried tosneak in, back over the 
ice, the river, which was completelyf rozen.  They tried to sneak back into 
Poland.  
 
 
At thatpoint, the Russians had sealed the border, and they got 
arrested. T he Russians putthem on trial, asspies, because they were going 
there, com ing back,and m y f ather got20 years hard
 
labor and wassent to 
Siberia.  
 
 
W e,onthe other hand, hisfam ily, was supposed to be also taken to 
Siberia like that. W e were all packed, ready to go, because asfam ilies ofa 

crim inal, quote unquote, we needed tobealso going to Siberia. But for so
m e 
reason, I don't know to this day, we didn't, they didn't take us. But they threw 

us out of ourhouse,and we hadtom ove away and toa sm all town called 
T ouste, which was a few kilom eters upthe road.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your father taken to Siberia, do you know if your m other 

knew what happened to him, where he went,anddid she hearf rom him ?

>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, after quiteaf ew months, we got a letter thathe 
was in a prison,a hard labor place. His conditions weren't as bad as the 
other
s. Being theonly m edical person, they didn't have any doctors, so he 
wa s
 
--
 
as a dentist, hewas m ade the medicalpersonthere.  Hehadsom e 
better conditionsthere.  
 
 
I know we had letters going back andforth. W esenta package or 
two .  B u t th e n, of 
course, it didn't take long before the Germ ans decidedthat 

they would break theagreem ent, andthey cam e right to the restof Poland.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You are now about8
 
1/2 when the Germ ans cam e into your 
area andtook over f rom  the Soviets.  
 
>> H a l i
na Peabody:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat changedthings dram atically, quickl y.  T ell uswhat 
happened once
 
--
  
>> Halina Peabody:  First, we did com eback to ourhouse, we reoccupied 

our house, and waitedto see, very f rightened, what these occupiersar
e 
going to do. T hey wer e Germ an. T hem ayor decided everybody had tobe 

workin g, especially the Jews.  Ever y Jew had to be working, doing som ething 
for the Germ ans.  If there was notenough work, they were told to clean the 
stre e ts.  
 
 
Also, they m ade very diff icult lifefor everybody, because they went 
around and they accosted people, like if there was a Jewish personwith a

beard, a lot of hair,they would stopthem  in the street and yell and scream 
andtake the hairoff . Things like that were happening
.  
 
 
W e were told that we have to give up, of course, any sil ver, gold, 
m oney or whatever ofvalue. W e were notallowed to have anything.  
 
 
W e were told toput a yellow star on the house, anda yellow arm band.  
 
 
No schoolf or Jewish children at all.  Mothertried to keep up asbest 
she couldm y writing s kills. W e just waited,what wi ll happen next? W e just 

hoped by cooperating things would notbe so terrible.  
 
 
My m other, though she had a baby, was told she,becausethey knew 
she was a good knitter, would be knitting f or the m ayor of  the town's children.  
He had lotsof  children.  So shedid that. T hat was her job.  
 
 
All in all, they were just putting all kinds of curfews and we were not
 
--
 
of  course, nom eat allowed.  T here were rations. W e were not allowed to go 
to certain places. Everything was ver y scar y.  
 
 
I just rem em ber being terrified.  Again, we just didn't know what was 
going on, what the
 
--
 
didn't know what the plan was.  
 
 
T hey used to demandgroups of people to goon various jobs outsi
d e 
of  town. T hey created a com m ittee of  Jewish leaders in that littletown, and 

they would m ake their demands through those com m ittees.  
 
 
If they needed100 people to go to some job, they would tell them ,and 
they would have to tell us to goand be there,and it had to be the right

number. TheGermans were ver y keen onnum bers.  
 
 
As I said, everybody was cooperating.  Then the SS arrived. T he SS, 
this was the
 
--
 
now, the blackunif orm s arrived, with the gold buttons, on 
m otorcycles, roaring down the street. Everyb ody was just hiding, trying not 
to be visible, becausewe got so terrif ied of them .  
 
 
T hey just cam e to do other things, obviously.  
 
 
W e didn't have long to wait.  T hey had demanded a group of people to 
be in the square in the m orning, and t
hey said that they wanted them to bind 
treesf orthe winter in a camp, just a little m ilitary cam p just up the road.  
Because the winters were soharsh, som etimes they would put burlap over 
th e  trun ks of the  tree s. 
 
 
So nobody was suspicious thatanything
 
was going to go wrong, and 
the whole group, som e volunteers,a lotof people came to the square, and 

they were m arched upthe road to do the work.  
 
 
As the restof  us were sitting and waiting for them to com eback,as 
usual,all day long we waited andnobody cam eback. Until late in the 
evening som ebody dragged him self  in, it was a man who told a story of  what 
happened there, and whathe said was that whenthey got there, there was 
an open grave with planks of  wood over it. They were told to striptheir
 
clothing, lay down on the planks,and they we re shot, one by one,and they, 

as they were shot, they f ell into the grave.

T here's 800people were there. T hism an was one of the lastones to 
be putdown, and he
 
--
 
they m issed him  andonly shot him  inth
e a rm . Af te r 
they kind of covered the grave som ewhat very li ghtly, they didn't need to, to 
do any m ore, he dragged him self out, andhecam e back and told us the 
story.  So we understood.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Halina, am  I correct that the800 victim s,m ost were young 

people?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  A lotof  young people.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Maybe later you'll be able to tell us what you did when you 
went back to Poland to comm em oratethem . 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Ican now.  T his was the m em ory that haunted 
m e .  A s  
young as I was, because it was sucha horrible, horrible event, that as young 
as I was, I was just horrified by it, and Inever forgot it.  I always thought there 
was nobody
 
--
 
nobody knew who they were, where they were.  T hegra ve 
was em pty. T here's nothing on it. I knew that, because we went back to 

Zaleszc zyki at one point and there was nothing.  
 
 
T hrough som em iracle, I recognized som epeoplef rom  Zaleszczyki i n 
the photo at the m useum , and I tracked them  down, and there happened to 

be a f ew 
of  us, apparently.  T he problem  was I was too young. I didn't know 
them . They knew m e. 
 

 
I tracked down, Ithink, aboutf ive of them , inMontreal, New
 
York, and 

13

they all welcom edm ewith open arm s. It was the strangest reunion. I didn't 
know them, and
 
they just loved m e because they rem em bered me as a baby.  
T hey knew m y f am ily, and they were actually in the m idst of collecting 

m oney, and they m ade a deal with the mayor of  the town there in 
Zaleszc zyki. W e went, April 2011,and we placed a monum enton
 
that grave.  
W ehad the cantor,hedid the Hebrew Kaddish, the prayerf or thedead. I 

have to say, this gave m e a littlepeace. That's thebest we could do.  But we 
also had raindrops com ing down, and we said it was thetearsf rom up there, 
f rom  the peo
ple.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter that,there were several other actions by the Germans, 

but yourm other began im mediately tryin g to think how she's going to save 
her two daughters.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, the thing is we wonderedabout what isgoing to 

be
 
next, and when thenext dem and cam ef orpeople to go to work in 
Germ any, everybody was already aware of what was happening, so 

ever ybody was hiding.  
 
 
W e were hidden by a cook thatused to com eto cookf orus. So then 
they took another few hundred peopl
e away.  Af ter that, because the 
comm unity wasn't that big, it was a sm all town, they didn't want to have the 
bother of having tof ind us, so they threw thewhole Jewish com munity out, 
whatever was lef t, andto thisplace calledTouste.  Not only us, butf
ro m  a ll 

14

around thatarea,they did the sam e thing,put us in together, so thatthey 
could easily f ind us.  
 
 
So we m ovedtoT ouste.  T here was sort of like a ghetto, or it becam e 
a ghetto, and we just knew what was going to happen next. Everyb ody was, 

f ir
st of all, lookingf or hiding places. My m other said tom e, you know, it's not 
going to helpmuch,becauseas soonas we f ind thehiding places, they'll 

m ove usagain.  
 
 
She was trying to get us away, tr ying to put us through some kind of  
transport to Ro
mania, but nothing worked.  
 
 
In them eantim e,of  course, the new demandcam e againfor work in 
Germ any, and everybody was scurryin g around, trying to hide.  My m other, 

because we had been in that town bef ore, had a couple of contacts.  So she 
placed me with af armer in a loft.  She herself  wentand made adeal with 
anotherfarm erto keep her andm y sister through the day whilst they were 
lookingf or people.  
 
 
W eseparated, andall day long I thoughtm y m other was caught,and 
the lady usedto comeback and
 
say to me" This one was seen, thisone was 
seen in the square."   
 
 
I was devastated.  I thought I lostm y m otherand sister.  
 
 
T owards the endof  the day, shedid come tocollect me, with m y 
sister, and toldm e herside of the story. W hat happenedtoher was that the 

15
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

farm er got scared in the m iddleof  theday, because it was a very hi gh 
penalty if  they caught this wom anhiding a Jew.  So she threw her out into the 
em pty f ield. T hef ield was f lat, just onebush, she toldm e.  She crouched 
wit h  m y s is t e r 
f or the rest of the day in that f ield.  She said it was am iracle 
they didn't seeher. They were circling with planesand just, as I said, it was 
just am iracle they didn't seeher.  
 
 
At thatpoint, she saidto me," From now on,we're not going to 
separa
te" because she thought I was taken.She said,"W e're going to stick 
together.W hatever happens to us, we will be together, whatever happens. " 
 
 
She started thinking we had nowhere to go, but with thehelp of her 
f riends they came upwith this idea of g
etting papers f rom  a priest.  T hey 
m ade a deal, they purchased the papers. W e got a new name andnew 

birthplace, new grandparents. Everything was new.  She satme down, she 
taughtm eall this stuff.  W e were going totry and just run away andgo to a 
p la
ce where nobody knew us, see if  we could survi ve.  Since we were all girls 
they couldn't check.  
 
 
W e were put on the train, and left ourf riends,and we were going toa 
place called Jaroslav, which was quite a ways in thosedays.  It was going to 

ta ke  two
 
days and twonights on the train, with the changes.  
 
 
W hat we had with us,our possessions now were t wo suitcasesand a 
little m oney that she collected. That was all we possessed.  And weboarded

the train, and we started our journey.  A young m anattac
hed him self  to us, 
startedtalking tom y mother,and slowly, slo wly he startedpushing her, 
pushing her.  My m other said tom e," You know, I'm  sorry to tell you that I 
couldn't resist.  He was pushing so hard, asking m e if there was a Jewish 
person in thefam ily."  My grandfather,father, it was enough if it was a 
great
-
great
-
grandf ather.  She said "Idid tell him  that we were actually Je wish.  
I did tell him that."   
 
 
At thispoint, he said "Well, you know, I have to take you to the 
gestapo, but Iam  going
 
to Jaroslav as well, so I will accom pany you to 
Jaroslav."   
 
 
T hat's how we tra veled.  
 
 
My m other again started thinking, thinking, thinking, there was 
nowhere to run. Shef inally came to a decision, and she said "I want tomake 

a deal with you.  I will
 
gi ve you the ticketsf orthe suitcases, I will gi ve you the 
m oney I have, evenprom isethe coats on our backs,"  and she said," All I ask 

is that when you bring us tothe gestapo thatyou have us shot im mediately."   
 
 
Of course, herf ear was that the tortu
r e  of  t he k id s .   Sh e  wa s  af r a i dof  
losing the kidsand separatingf rom the children.  Heprom ised. T hat's how 

we traveled to Jaroslav.  
 
 
W hen we got closer,and when we started getting off  thetrain in 
Jaroslav, I started remembering that we were  going to go and get shot. So I

So Itried pulling atm y m other, I said, " Mom ,m om , I don't want to die."   
 
 
So she turned tohim ,she askedhim  if he would letm e go.  Since I 
was blonde, green

to survive.  But I said "No, I don't wantto goby m yself ."  It was terrif ying.  
 

 
As we're walkin g towar ds the gestapo, she says to him ," Do youhave 
children of your own?"
 
 
And he said, 
"Yes."  
 
 
So she said tohim " Look, I've given you ever ything I have.  You can 
takeeverything. W hydo you want us on your conscience?  Just letus go

And somehow it touched him ,and he said" OK," buthe said

know if  they were real or not, they're here at them useum, but as I said in 
those days there were no com puters, they couldn't check,but we had no 
idea. They were gi ven to us, new nam e, different people. W edidn't know.  
 
 
At any rate, it was ver y im portant we shouldbe inside, not be on the 
street. So wef ound a little cafe.  My m other asked people around there if  

there was som ebody who would rent room s.One youngm an got up, said 
" Ye s ,  
I know a nice washer lady just up the road. I will take you there, 
because she takes lodgers."  
 
 
So he walked usover there, the lady was really ver y nice and sweet, 
and she said" Motherand two children? Yeah, I'll take you."  
 
 
Her sons were not happy, they told her not to.  W e looked bedraggled 
andfull of stuff in thehair, everywhere.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  You had lice?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Lice all over the place, clothes, hair, everywher e.  Four

" No, no, a mother and

So she took her in. My m other toldher "I have no money, but

A s  n on

Jews, of  course, there was schoolf or m e,f or two hours aday, 
so I went to school. I had very little background in Catholic religion,andI 

only knew that Ihad to cross m yself  com ing in and com ing out,butver y little 
else.  So it was very h elpfulfor me,becausethen catechism, we imm ediately 
learned the catechism , and because I could read it was m uch easier for me 
to learn everything, from  Ato Z.  
 
 
It wa s
 
ver y f rightening.  You had to watch everything ver y caref ully. I 
rem em ber once I crossed m yself  with the lef thand, I looked around,terrif ied 
that somebody had seen m e, of course.  Any little thing would have gi ven me 
away.

Catholic and know a bit aboutthe catechism,m ass,things like that,but you 
also had different names, theref ore differentparents.

W hatever she said, she was a wonderf ulparent. She broughtm eup to

But you know, there were little things. T herewere little things that 
happened that you could notf oresee.T he teacher suddenly said

Poland it's very diff icult when you're supposed to say hello to people when 

you see them .  It's a silly thing, but if  you see
 
som ebody, you say hello.  She 
claim ed I didn't say hello.  And I never saw her.  And I rem em ber m y m other 

said, " Don't worry.  Just apologize."   
 
 
If elt it was sounfair.  So Itook a little chance.

W eused to stealfood.  The farm ersused to bring in contingents. T hey had 

to be weighed in, carrots and potatoes, whatever, because we were short of

that was to give to the Germ ans, they didn'tm ind if we clim bed upon the

your identity secret, you were still at risk in that particular house, becauseof  
the sons.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Because of the sons, and because alsom y m other was 
ver y worried about m y sister's hair.  My sister had like anaf ro, and in Poland 
the Polish girls have straight blonde hair.  She was so worried about that.  It 
was enough if  somebody pointed.  
 
 
She had shaved her head altogeth
er, twice. T he poor kid.  Of  course, 
m y sister didn't know anything, she was a baby. W e didn't tell heranything, 
and she really gre w up as a little Polish girl.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat tim e, she was also pretty ill, wasn't she?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Very sick.  M y m other was very, ver y worried about her. 

Finally, shef ounda seconddoctor that helped her. In the meantime,m y 
m other gotone letter with som enews f rom  the people we lef t, bef ore they 
perished. T hey passed on inf orm ation aboutm y f ather, who apparently had

T his was som ething that gave us a little bitof hope, that if and when 
this war would ever end.  So we would havesom ewhere to go andsom ebody

to do with you.

forever tryin g tof ind som ething tom ake itm ore secure.  Oneof  the things 
she wanted to do wasoffer herself for work in Germany.  Now, any Pole 
coulddo that. T hey alwa ys needed people in Germany. T hey would have 
taken us,but m y sister was too young.  So she would have had to leave m y 
siste r.  B ut tha td id n 'two rk o u t.  
 
 
T hen she came up with this ideaof hiding inplain sight. She thought if  
she hadanID, like Ihave, showing she works  for the Germ ans, thatthat 
m ight be useful,and that's when she appliedto the Germ an m ilitary cam p to 
work.  T hat's why shefinally, af ter weeks of  waiting, not knowing, they were 
checking the papers,they said, after weeks of  waitingf inally she got her 
work.  She got the jobof peeling potatoes,but shehad the ID. 
 
 
Oneday, one night,the Germ ans did come storm ing into the house.

You were not allowed to do that. They never found him . They didn't f ind him 
this time. But whatthey did, they yelled and screameda
nd took everybody 
into the station to check them  out, if they wer e working, except for us 
becausem y m other cam eup with this ID.  He said " No, you stay."   So the 
only Jews in the house, we stayed. T hey took the rest to the station. T hey 
checked them out. They were all OK, so they cam e back the next m orning.  
 
 
Again, you know, it was all these littlethings that couldhappen, 
im agine.  You justhave to bealways on the lookout,alwa ys worried about

when she was working in the Germ an headquarters, when the officer came in

this off icer cam e into the kitchen, with a dog. He said, " No

it's im possible."  But she said"W hat if  thatdog tookf ancy to me?"
 
 
T hoseare the kind of things.  Everything was  petrif ying.  All these little

she was in bed with m y sister, I was standing

work or not. W edidn't know what was the status. W ehad no radios, no 
newspapers,no idea what was happening.  
 
 
So as we were standing, as I was standing there, suddenly there was 
a trem endous bang, and a bom bf ell and split over thehouse. That's where
 
I

W e wentover, through, out of the house, through the kitchen, the roof

I say that knowing not all Polesare bad. It'sunf ortunate that that is 
what happened to us. Wehad to keep thatpretensefor a while, until we lef t 
the town.  Evenf urther, when we neededtobe in another place where they 
askedus directly, " Areyou a Pole?"
 
Meaning are younot Jewish? W ehad to keep that pretensefor quite a while.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, untilessentially leavin g the country?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  My m other started knitti

and started placing advertising to f ind m yf ather.  My father had noidea we

placed

but sheobviously would target Palestine,and by some again 
m iracle the people inthe station inT el Aviv k new m y f atherpersonally.  So 

im mediately the contact was m ade.  Imm ediately, when I say im m ediately it 
tooka long tim e. Mail was slo w.  Butm y father arrangedfor m y cousin, who 
was in the Britisharm y, to come back to Poland,and toput us in touch with 
the Jewish agency.  T hey would take usoutof the country, and we would 
rejoin him.  
 
 
W hat I learned about him  was that, as I said,hem anaged to getout of  
Russia by running away f rom the prisonhe was in,by joining General

T hey were all worried, and they were short ofm en. T his was an 
agreem ent between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin,that he would let some 
people out. That's how m y f ather came out,andm y aunt anduncle and 
cousin. They cam e out of  Russia. T hey ended up inPalestine. My father 
was actually in the Polish unit, which was part of  theBritish arm y. They were 
stationed in Egypt.  
 
 
W henf inally we got reunited, we had the choice of either going to 
Palestine or to England.  W eendedup going to England.T hat's where I 
gre w up the rest of thetim e,and that's whereI started learning E
n glis h ,  
which was ver y difficult.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we continue on with that, Halina, tell us about how 
you got outof  the country and leaving Poland, then making your wa y to Italy, 
andthen to England.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, we were in a com munal hom e, which Polish police 

attacked,but they didn't get in. That was one of  the things. T hen what they 
did, they had this arrangement with the trucks would takeus out justpast the 
f rontier,between Germany andPoland,and they would bribe the guards with 
som e vodka,and they allowed

there was aquiet agreement that the Jews 
were going to be allowed to leave Poland, if  they wanted to.

So they hadthese trucks going over, and inour case the guards, of 
course, the Russian guard wantedm ore watches. They loved watches.  Full 
of  pocket watches. T hey had to give extra watches.  
 
 
T hen we were supposed to makeour way to the railway station to go 
to Berlinonthe train. But what happened was they ref used to sell us tickets, 
because we were Jews, and it was af ter thewar.  But som ehow, I don't know, 
t h is

as I said, therewas a Jewish agency already in charge, they m anaged 
to get us through. W eended up being in a DP cam pfor a very short tim e, 

because

ironic situation you ran into.

suddenly decided that we were not Jews, that we were pretending to be Jews 
in order to getoutof  Poland.

So you tookup table

Peabody:  Yes.  I wanted tennis.  Actually, I love tennis.  But there 
were nof acilities. In college there was a table there, and we started playing 

tabletennis. T hen when we bought ahousein London, there was a youth 
club, Maccabi youth club, a Jewish youth club, they're all over theworld.  I 
joinedthe cluband played m oretable tennis. I playeda lot.  
 
 
W ehad a team , we went around, like here, they have leagues, we did 
a lotof  that.  Idid not know that,but of  course, in them eantim e,Palestin
e 
becam eIsrael. Sofar away f rom m e,I never even thought of it as aplace to 
go.  But in 1953, they told usthat the Maccabiah games were going to be on, 
andthey were going to send a team  representing England to Israel. By then, 
I was pretty good, and
 
thehonor of  representing England.

>> Bill Benson:  You were still a champion.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Maccabiah. A
t an y ra te ,th a t wa s m yf irst trip  to Israe l, 
which was absolutely fantastic.  Ithought I'dfound m y Shangrila.  I spent two 
m onths,If oundm y f am ily.  I m etm y two girlf riends I knew f rom before the

I  wa s  in  Ha if a ,  in T e l A

knew m y m other was waiting f or m e.  I prom isedm yself  I will go back again, 
andunfortunately m y m other died in1956, so I in1957 went againto the next 
Maccabiah.  It's like Olym pic gam es,every f our years. 
 
So in 1957. I said to 
m yself ,this tim eI'm  going to stay here, just to seehow it's like.  I had lotsof  

places to stay with, becauseeverybody was wonderful, m y cousins, m y 
f riends, everybody.  
 
 
So thenI liked it som uch that I got m y sisterover as well, and shem et 
herf uturehusband there.  She actually went back to England. I stayed.  I 
worked f irstfor a British com pany, and thenwhen they sold the ref ineries to 
the Israelis,m y Hebrew wasn't good enough, so I lookedf oranother job and 
found oneat theAmerican em bassy in Tel Aviv.  T hat's why I'm  here. T hat's 
where I foundm y husband and how we f irst cam e tothe United States.  
 
 
If irst went toPaloAlto, then we came here. Ithought we'd go back to

ver y ill r ight af ter the war ended, and you had to strugg

>> Halina Peabody:  She was diagnosed with cancer right afterm y hand 

happened. I always think it was becauseof  the tension, of the desperate 
feeling that she had. My sister was so sickly, her health was ruined.  Shefelt 
thatI was the strong one,and I got wounded.  So she was very, ver y 
devastated.

holidays?  Or were you super scaredthat youcouldn't do that
?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.  First of all,m y sister didn't know she was Jewish.  

W edidn'ttell her.  In f act, when she was asked, when she was accused of 
being Jewish when the Russians came in, som ebody said" You can tell us 
now, you're Jewish."   She said" Look at me. I don't have horns.  Idon't have 
a tail."  Shehad no idea.  No idea.  No.  
 
 
W e were not observant as Jews.  At 7, certainly, I knew I was going to 
Hebrew school. T hat's all I knew.  I could only si gn m y name in Hebrew.  I

was not quite 7. W e were not very observant. W e were Jewish. T hat's all I 
knew.  T henm y m other keptm e straight.  My m other was ver y cleve r, I 
thought.  Of course, she saidtom e, "Look, we all pray to the sameGod,and 
it doesn'tm atter whether you're Jewish, Catholic or whatever.  You're Jewish.  
You're born Jewish, yo u m ightas well stay Jewish.  It's better that way."   But 
th a t's a ll.  
 
 
I never had any problem s with that.  I'm notobservant today, either, 
I'm  sorry to say.  Maybe it's wrong, but Ithinkthatby being with them useum, 

I thinkthat's how I express m y Jewishness, and I love Israel.  In Israel people 
aren't very observant, either, so

[Laughter]
 
So Idon'tf eel that it'sa bad thing.  
 
 
I thinkthat the lucky thing about being Jewish is they don't
 
excom municate you if you don'tdo it.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  It'salso important to rem em ber even if  you hadbeen inclined 
to try to practice a little bit of your faith, you were living in a teeny house with 
a lotof  otherpeople so the risks were unim aginable.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No way.  
 
>> You said you were separatedf rom your fatherf or seven years. W hat was 
that like, andhow did you m ake upf or lost time?

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, you do the best you can.  He had problem s getting 
a job, because af ter he was out of the arm y, his language wasn't good.  He 
hadto goback to some courses, sohe couldn't be adentistf ora while.  It 
wasn't easy.  It was

the bruntof  theproblem  was f rom m y m other, not me.  
I went to school, and all they wa
nted m e is

all m y m other ever wanted was 
education, education,education.  Shefought ver y hardf or that.  Ofcourse, 
they couldn't help us in any wa y.  Butm y sister hadnoproblem sbecause 
she was only like 5
 
1/2.  I had a m uch harder tim e.  
 
 
I had m y table tennis. T hat was mostly what happened. It'snoteasy.  
Fam ilies are com plicated, and especially if  you're separatedfor seven years.  
It can't be easy.  I think that the brunt of the problem  was f rom m y mother, 
andI was so sorry that she, af ter all she went through,af ter all she did, she 
hadthis hard lif eaf terwards as well.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe're probably at the tim eto bring it to a close, soI'm  

going to turnback to Halina to closeourprogram  in justam om ent.  I want to 
thank all of youf or being here.  W e have

word.  After Halina is done, you're going to step down off  the stage,you can 
stay f oraf ew m inutes?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  If  youwant to meet her, aska question, pleaseabsolutely do 
th a t.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, I wantto say thank you very m uchf or com ing andbeing willin g to listen to 
these stories. I think it's im portantf or thepeople to hear eyewitness stories, because there's still 
people who deny that it happened.  It's justawarning f or thef uture,because a lotof  people stoodby 

anddid nothing, and you can't do thatanym ore.  Everybody needs to help in watching, being vi gilant 

andtrying to help everybody else in this world.  
 
 
I'm  very, ver y keen talking to young people,and as I said, I'm  very happy tohonor m y mother 
andthe 6m illion that we lost. 
 
 
I will never stop m ourning them , but that's m y burden, andI justhope that you will learn 
som ething f rom  that
, and I'm  sure that having just com eto themuseum  youalready are well on the 
wa y, so I don't want to preach.  
 
 
T hank you som uchfor listening.
