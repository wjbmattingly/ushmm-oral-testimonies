Question: This is a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Leonard Vis, 
conducted by 
Ina Navazelski s
, on Novemb er 9
th
, 2008, in
 
Alexandria, Virgin ia.
 Mr.
 Vis, 
thank you for agreeing to sp
eak with us today, about 
what happened to you before Œ wh at ki
nd of life you had befo re the Holocaust, 
during and after. And as we do 
in all of our interviews, we want to start at the 
beginning. Could you tell us a little bit abou
t where you were born, your family, your 

circumstances, how many sibli
ngs you had, and so on. 
Answer: I can tell you a lot abou
t that, because after all, I™m alive to tell you. I was 
born on the 16
th
 of September, 1930 in  
Amsterdam, Holland
. My family tree goes 
back to before the Fr
en ch revolu tion. It™s important to mention that, because we as 
Jews generally are somewhat of an errant na
tion. But we were very well settled there, 
we were utterly accultured, and I can truthf
ully say that Yiddish was fairly unknown 
to us. I have a brother who was born in  
1934, and a siste r in 1935. My parents, 
Maurice
(ph) and 
Francisca
, my father was born in 
1895. And then Œ he still 
belonged to the 19
th
 century, was rather interesting. And my  mo ther was born in 
1901, both in 
Amsterdam
. 
Q: How did he belong to the 19
th
 century? 
A: Because he was born in 1895.

Q: Ah, I see. I thought you meant by th e wa
y his world view was, his outlook, his Œ 
his Œ 
A: Well, my father wore starched collars
, and needed a little hook for the collar to 
hook into the Œ into 
the collar button. So , he wore high
 boots, with shoes Œ with  the Œ 
with shoelaces. Yeah, he was Œ he Œ well, he was a product of his time. And he 
belonged to a very unknown Jewish family
. When  my  mo ther got engaged to  him, 
people said oh, what a shame that 
Francisca
 is marrying a non-Jew. But that was 
mainly because he was not Œ the family 
was very small. My 
mother comes from a 
very large family. He
r maid en  n ame is  
Depaauw, d-e-p-
double 
a-u-w.
 And they 
were affiliated with the 
Ushers
, which was a very important patrician family in 
Amsterdam.
 So Œ and then ther
e was the family of 
Souget, s-o-u-g-e-t, 
of which 
there is an extens
ive family tree in 
Jerusa lem
 at the genealogical institute of the 
University of
 Jerusa lem. 
Q: What was the Œ what was the Œ what was 
the world like there? It was Œ was Œ were 
people connected also by professions? That
 is, did they Œ did they family™s you 
mentioned also have business interests together? 

A: The 
Ushers
 were in the diamond business. 
Souget
 was medicine insurance. 
Vis
 
was textile. 
Q: Oh, textile. 
A: So that was Œ yeah, that was sort 
of the Œ but they were not connected 
professionally. It was really at Œ from what 
I recall, it was really a family affair. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559

inherited the wedding banquet photograph 
of my  parents, 1929, Novemb er. I lost 
touch with these people when I was about
 nine, and yet I coul
d mention Œ I could 
name, of the 45 people who were invited, 
ro ughly 23 Œ 43, sorry. Wh ich, for a kid 
that age Œ so it was th-th-the Œ the fam
ily impressions that sort of stayed.  
Q: What kind of Œ wh
at kind of childhood do you reme mb er? 
A: I had a terrific child hood. I was a st Œ a 
sin g le child for three and a half years. I 
was well liked. I was rather shy, funny en
o ugh . Bu t my  mo th er 
spent a lot of time 
with me. My mother was so
rt of a frustrated tomboy, 
I think. We went swimmi ng 
together. She compiled lists of au
to makes for me. We clipped out 
Rupert
, the Œ the 
comic strip, 
Rupert
 the Bear, from the newspaper and 
made picture books out of it. I 
was allowed to read the newspaper. The newspaper used  to come in in the evening, 

fall on the mat behind the front door, and I wa
s allowed to read it as long as I was Œ 
took Œ treated it neatly. And of course, I c
ouldn™t read at three and a half, but I could 
make out the pictures that were in there. So 
I consider that a very good so rt of start of 
l Œ a sense of literacy. I™ve always loved read
ing, I could always be find with a book 
Œ be found with a book, and then  I went to 
school at age five. That was a very strange 
thing. I™m born in September, as I said, a
nd I would not be allowed into the first 
grade, because I became six on the 16
th
 of September. But as I said, I had a very 
scrappy mother, who didn™t take this lying 
down, and who interpreted the Œ th e law 
that you couldn™t go into th
e first grade with age five, as
 saying that you could enter 
grade two at age six. There were more moth
ers like that, and I went to a preparatory 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
6
 
 
first grade, which was quite wo
nderful. It mu st have been expensive, there were all 
kinds of kids of Œ 
Q: It™s a private school. 
A: Private school. Kids of
 reasonably wealthy, middle 
class families. And it was 
about that time in 1935 that my
 mother gave birth to my sister. And I said at that 
point to my father that I didn™t think 
it was a good idea that I would go on vacation 
with mother any longer Œ I was very political
ly oriented Œ because she would need all 
her attention for my little brother, and her 
newborn baby. And my 
father said, what 
do you have in mind? And I sa
id, well, I heard in school there is something like a 

kinder pensionne, 
a youth hostel for young children. 
[cough]
 Excuse me. And I 
would be very interested in 
going to a place like that. The kids in school think it™s 
terrific. And my  father asked around, co llea
gues of his in the train, mo stly Jewish, 
and he found a place for me to go to with 
a colleague of his w
ho needed some extra 
money, who had a bigger hous
e than he could really affo
rd, and the house was full of 
kids, and they would have a space for me
. So, come the Chri
stmas holidays, my 
father took me to a town called 
Am ersfoort
, east of 
Amsterdam.
 The train was very 
cold, we did gymnastics, I reme
mber that as of yesterday, in order to stay warm. And 
Œ 
Q: It must have looked funny 
having your father do gymn astics. 
A: Oh yeah, we were hanging from the lugga
ge racks, and th ings like that, yeah. And 
Œ and it was fun to be togeth er with my  fath
er, nobody else on the train. It was a d Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
7
 
 
sort of a seminal experience. And I Œ so 
we came there, to this wonderful home, 
which was full of German kids, émigré kids 
Q: German Jewish kids. 
A: German Jewish kids. Was kosher, the whole place. We had a kosher home. We 

had Œ let me go back a bit to the home 
for a moment, we had the maid, a nanny, a 
lady for ro ugh work , and a seamstress who 
came every Tuesday afternoon, because 
we were not beyond having a patch in our 
pants. She did the necessary stuff. So that 
was sort of the household personnel. My 
mo ther always did the co oking. Sh e didn™t 
leave that to anybody. 
Q: I™m jealous. 
A: Well, if you have a kosher home, you d
on™t want to delegate
 that, necessarily. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And anyway, they  loved to have me ther
e, I Œ I remember that
 they gave me my  
own bed. It was a harmonica bed. 

Q: What™s a harmonica bed? 

A: It™s a camp cot that collapses, but it 
was called a harmonica bed, which I had to 
make every night. Make my  bed, and take 
off my bedding in th
e morning, fold it up 
nicely. I was only five, yeah. And so I Œ or was I six? No, I think I was five. And I 

had to place this bed between two sliding doors.
 Much later I rea lize d  that these pla Œ 
people didn™t have any space for me, that the harmonica bed was sort of an 

expediency. That the place bes Œ the sp
ace between two sliding doors sort of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559

happened  to  be, and they could use the mone
y. Bu t that didn™t detract from the fun of 
the situation, had a wonderful two weeks there. 
Q: So ye Œ wa Œ did th
ey have this sort Œ
 kinder pensionne 
in Œ in this pla Œ had they 
already organized it and it had been fully b
ooked, and that™s why there had been  no 
place, and you came in
 kind of late, as a registration? 
A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: Yeah, okay. 
A: Well, it wasn™t really a registration,
 the place was packed 
with these refugee 
children, and when my fa
ther talked to Uncle
 Jacques, 
whatevers his name is, wife 
was 
Judith
, he said, yeah, we c Œ we can handle 
that. You know, this
 kind of thing. 
And there was nothing terribly formal about 
it, but they took me in. And they were 

wonderful, they loved kids. And th ere wa
s an old grandmother who was also very 
good with kids, and of course there was a 
whole stratum of kids; I was the youngest. 
The next oldest was se ven, whic
h is a yet Œ humungous difference. 
Q: And did you talk to thes
e kids who were refugee kids mu ch, about wh ere they had 
come from,  and did the adult wo rld in any way Œ 
A: Nobody spoke abou
t these things, the kids Œ kids are kids, they™re Œ they™re 
interested in Œ in the here and now, not in the hereafter, 
and in th e world to come, or 
what have you.  
Q: So, there was no talk about we had to leave 
Germany
 and had something like that 
Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
9
 
 
A: No, no, everybody tried to
 speak Du tch as well as they could, and they Œ we had 
Shabbas services, and you know
, made kiddush at night, fo
r a Friday night. I don™t 
reme mb er going to  shul, but th at didn™t Œ 
Q: How long did you stay there? 

A: Two weeks. 

Q: Just two weeks? 
A: Yeah, my Christmas vacation. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And Œ 
Q: Why does that stay in your memo ry
, this two weeks, out of Œ out of Œ 
A: I became 
Monopoly
 champion at five. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah. I don™t know how I did it, but I was pretty good at it. And Œ oh yeah , and I 
remember Œ no, that was in 
a Œ in a autumn vacation later on, we learned to gather 
mu shrooms, which was important, I liked mu
shrooms. Chanterelle especially. And so 

that was the Christma s vacation, went back  to school, and in  the f Œ summer of Œ I 
was that Œ I turned Œ no, I tu
rned six in the meantime, yeah , so I was six when I went 
there. And then I went to second grade, 
private school. Same grade, same  school that 
Marion Pritchard
 went to. We had the same  head of th e Œ head of the school. We 
had the same lady who taught
 us carpentry and stuff. 
Q: Amazing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
10
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t your father, what kind 
of business was he in? 
A: He was the representative for a te
xtile firm in the eastern part of
 Holland. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And his area of operations was 
essentially the western provinces. 
Q: A Dutch textile firm, or Œ 
A: Dutch textile firm, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Dutch textile 
firm, okay. So he
 was a salesman? 
A: His father had that agency already, an
d my  father was very proud, and he said, 
you know
, Vis
 and Sons, since 1888. 
Q: Wow. 

A: So it had been in the family for quite
 some time. I have a telephone book of 
Amsterdam 
in 1915, and both my  gra
ndfathers had telephone, which in those years 
was rather unusual.  

Q: Very unusual. 

A: Yeah. My grandfather on my  mo ther™s
 side was in the diamond business. 
Q: Did you have any contact 
with non-Jewish Dutch familie
s in any significant way? 
A: Oh yeah, I went Œ I went 
to a mixed school, you know Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ the school was du Œ it was a Œ it 
was a private school, but it was open to 
everybody, there was no Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
11
 
 
Q: So, it wasn™t a Jewish school, it wasn™t a Jewish Œ 
A: No, absolutely not. 
Q: Yeah, okay. 
A: No. But I was always o
ff on Saturday morning. In
 those years schools were 
work ing Œ were operating on Satu
rday mo rn ing, so I never went to school. I did have 
Œ and Œ an d the only thing that they  gr
ad ed you on that was done on Saturday  
mo rning was singing. So, every quarter I had 
to sing very  priv ately, but in public, a 
song on which I was being grad ed. And I re
memb er having th e street smarts to sing a 

patriotic song, so th at nobody could accuse
 me of either being too Jewish, or too 
whatever. I Œ 

Q: Or not Dutch enough. 

A: Or not Œ yeah. I Œ I sang a song that was 
sort of the exhilaration of Dutch passion.  
Q: Did you like the song? 
A: Yeah, I made sure that 
I liked the song, but I also 
made sure that the song Œ 
Q: Was appropriate. 
A: Œ was for the purpose that I intended it to be. 
Q: That™s a lot of thinking fo
r somebody who is a little boy. 
A: Yeah, yeah, but I think that is also genetically induced. Th
ere™s something about 
survival, even in civilized 
circumstances that sort of 
prep ares you fo r these kind of 
things. It Œ I don™t think I™m supersensitiv
e on that, but I Œ I do feel that Œ well, 
you™re never totally part of the social fa
bric because the people let you feel that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
12
 
 
you™re a little bit different. 
So, on your own, you try to 
minimize that difference as 
much as possible. 
Q: Do you have any memo ries
 of how that was Œ how you 
felt that, when you were Œ 
before the war, as a ch ild? 
A: Specific instances, I Œ I really don™t re
memb er, no, no. You k
now, for one thing, 
Holland
 was a Œ a tolerant society in the se
nse that in 1848 ev erybody got civil 
rights, yo Œ everybody beca
me a citizen. So you Œ you 
Œ you had voti
ng rights. And 
the Jews Œ the Catholics actually were the last
 ones to Œ to get their civil rights, but Œ 
so no, there was no particular sense of a
pprehension. But you kno
w, you knew sort of 
intuitively that if you were to Œ ca
lled upon to sing, yo
u didn™t sing the 
Hatikva
 even 
if it was a song that you kn
ew best. You sang something 
that was typically Dutch, 
and extolled the virtue of the nation. So th
at was Œ I stayed in that school until the 
Germans invaded 
Holland
, that was in 1940. So for 
us the war starte d in 1940. 
Q: What was the date, do you rememb er? 

A: Yeah, it was the 10
th
 of May. 
Q: Do you reme mb er the day? 
A: I remember it very vividl
y. It was just before the 
Wh itsu n
 fa Œ vacation, 
Pentecost is 
Whitsun. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: And I heard planes coming over, and I went
 to see my parents in their bedroom, 
and they  said that the Germans had invaded 
Holland, 
that was on the radio. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
13
 
 
had a stamp collection of German inflati
onary stamps from post World War I, and I 
asked my father if we couldn™t buy these 
guys off with all these mo Œ millions of 
marks that I had of these little
 stamps. That I remember ve
ry clearly. My f Œ in Œ and 
this is also important, this is act
ually very important; in Œ during th e 
Whitsun
 
vacation in 1939, so that is roughly May - 
June, my  mo ther and my father left for 
England
 on a short vacation, and my  mo ther went to 
Australia
 house to get visas for 
us for 
Australia. 
Q: You anticipated my  next question, whic
h was, by the time of that invasion, had 
there been discussions in
 your family about Œ 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Œ how to leave? 

A: Yeah. And th ey got visas for our family
. My mo ther got visa
s for her two sisters 
and their families. Must have been easy to get that, I suppose. But my oldest uncle 
said, we can™t leave, we cannot leave my  
father-in-law to his own devices. We can™t 
leave him alone. 
Q: That would have b
een your grandfather? 
A: My grandfather. And my father said, Mo
ther, in times of need, th e captain does 
not leave the ship. That the 
ship intended to kick the 
captain off the bridge was 
something th at nobody was thinking 
of. So we didn™t use the visas. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
14
 
 
Q: Oh my. 
A: I want to say that that was never Œ 
it was never a poin t of dispute between my  
parents, my mother was incredibly loyal. 
I do not understand why 
they didn™t see the 
danger, because it was being spelled out 
in capital letters. If I may refresh your 
memory, because you™re stu Œ you™re st Œ 
quite a bit younger than  I am; it started off 
with 
Austria
, with 
Czechoslovakia
, then it went all the way to 
Denmark
, to
 
Norway
, who were declare Œ who had declared
 themselves neutral, and the Dutch 
government said nothing will happen here. So
 this kind of lulling the troops to sleep 
was something that everybody wanted to be
lieve in. Just like Islam is a religion of 
peace, which it isn™t. But we like to believe
 it, because it creates a comfort zone for 
us. 
[indecipherable]
 I was in 
Germany
 in 1991. I worked there. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: When  the war went up. 
Q: You worked there in
 1961 when  the war Œ 
A: 1961. 
Q: Œ when th e war went up. 
A: Right, in 
Berlin.
 And I got a telephone call from my  mo ther, and she says, 
Leonard,
 what are we going to do? I said, well, 
my  car is filled up. I have two cans Œ 
two jerrycans full of gas in there, two tires
 mounted on rims, and if anything happens, 
I™m on my  way south to  
Portugal.
 And my mother said, how about us? And I said, 
Mother, I™ve never heard anybody fleeing from 
F ra n kfurt Ma in 
via 
Amsterdam
 to  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
15
 
 
Portugal. 
Geographically not healthy. Wh at do y
ou advise us to do? I said, that™s 
very simp le. Take some money out of th
e bank, and get yourself a vacation in 
Ireland
 and see how it shakes out
. You think they went? 
Q: They stayed in 
Frankfurt
? 
A: They stayed in
 Amsterdam. 
Q: They stayed in
 Amsterdam
, excuse me, cause of 
Frankfurt
 I didn™t understand Œ 
A: Yeah, I lived in
 Frankfurt. 
Q: You lived in
 Frankfurt am Ma in
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And my mother said, what about us? 

Q: Yeah. And they stayed in 
Amsterdam. 
A: And they  stayed in 
Amsterdam,
 they didn™t go on
 an Irish vacation. 
Q: In 1961? 

A: In 1961. And we didn™t kn
ow which way this cookie wo
uld crumble. So wh at I™m 
trying to  point out is that either you are a survivor, or you are not. 
Q: But some people are survivor
s even when th
ey are lulled. 
A: Then they have mo
re luck than brain. 
Q: Mm. 

A: So that was the situation 
in 1939, my  mo th er saw it very
 clearly, my mother is a 
survivor, my father definitely
 not. Lovely man, loved hi
m dearly, but he Œ a product 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
16
 
 
of another century. Yeah, he™d 
like to go with my mother to
 England
, and he was 
pleased that she was successful in getting the 
visas, but to make use of it is different 
kettle of fish. 
Q: So what happened ? 

A: On th e 14
th
 of May, my father felt that may b
e the time would have come to drive 
to the coast and see if we could get on a ship to 
England
. Of course, that was totally 
impossible, there was Œ there was a treme
ndous to-do on the co
ast and nobody could 
get to the harbor of 
[indecipherable]
. And the people who did 
get Œ get out, got out 
earlier. But it Œ it was hopeless, and we tu
rned the car around, 
and we went to a 
seaside resort, where we saw the Germans en
ter the country. Very
 disciplined, very Œ 
very well disciplined, well o
iled ma-machine. And I rememb
er th at on the Œ was the 
15
th
 of May, we were waiting to see how th e 
situation would turn  out, and my  father 
and I went to a barber to get a haircut. No
t ex actly a deed of resistance, but under the 
circumstan ces, why not get a ha
ircut? Then we went to 
Holland
 Œ to  Œ to wh en we Œ 
we went back home to 
Amsterdam
. We resumed our life. The first measure that the 
Germans enacted was Œ and we neve
r speak about Nazis, by the way. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Nazis is something that
 the Dutch do not know. 
Q: Tell me why is that? 
A: Because, here in 
North America 
there are a lot of loyal Germans. So we wish  to 
exclude them from the bad 
Germans, so we call the bad Germans Nazis. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
17
 
 
explained that to the schoolchildren wh en
 I speak at schools, and I give the 
Hitler
 
salute. And I said, do you know what percen
tage of the Germans were card carrying 
party members? Five percent. And they 
couldn™t have done it by themselves. And 
mo st of them were too high 
up in the party administration 
to really bother with Jews. 
So th-they understand that, so I never sp
 Œ it Œ it™s not part of my  vocabulary. 
Q: To talk about Nazis? 
A: Yeah, yeah, no, we call them 
deutsches
(ph)
, mofa
(ph), krauts, if you will. But 
never talked about Nazis. In fact, we Œ 
we Œ the only Nazis that we knew were 
NSBers,
 they were Dutch Nazis.  
Q: Did you know any personally? 
A: Yeah, they used to come
 to school in their Dutch 
Nazi uniform. Kids, yeah. I 
mean, they were a bit stupid, you know, they
 Œ we didn™t think too mu ch of them, I 
don™t think they were exclud
ed, but by virtue of coming in  to Œ in  their uniform to 
school, they excluded themselves, really. Anyway, I finished school, and for the 

summer vacation my mother came up with a 
plan and said, we™re leaving Œ we™re go 
Œ I wou Œ Father has rented a house in 
Bussum,
 which is out in the country. We™re 
going th ere for our vacation. And while we 
were there, my moth
er and my father 
decided to  move to 
Bussum. 
At that time you didn™t need a permit to move. 
Q: How far from 
Amsterdam 
was it? 
A: 25 kilometers. 

Q: Okay .
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
18
 
 
A: And we lived in that ho
use. In the meantime my fa
ther emptied the house in 
Amsterdam,
 which was rented. 
Q: That is, he had rent
ed it from somebody else? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Okay , it wasn™t oi Œ his ownership, okay . 

A: No, it wasn™t his own house. He had an
 own house, but that was where his office 
was. But the living house was rented from 
a man who couldn™t pay his bills in 1930 
or 1929, that™s when they started the Œ it 
was a very nice house. So I never saw my  
bedroom ag ain. I never said goodbye to anybody in
 Amsterdam
 because we were 
gone temporarily, and that temporarily 
turned out permanently. Our nanny came 
along, but she couldn™t stay too long beca
use Dutch Jews were not allowed to have 
Gentile personnel. And in Œ 
a young cousin of my mothe
r™s came and helped us. I 
mean, after all, she had three kids. Since 
my mother pulled this off, her two sisters 
also moved to 
Bussum.
 
Q: So this was your Œ rea
lly your mother™s initiative? 
A: Yeah, and she was the young
est. But she had the better part of what we commonly 
know Œ call
 chutzp ah
, of which the vernacular transl
ation is brass balls. Anyway, I 
went to school there, private school, nice school, upper middle class school. All these 

things were organized. I mean, it was very sm
ooth. I really didn't  feel that Œ well, a 
kid looks at these things as adventure. I Œ 
I Œ I hope that you get that sense from other 
interviewees. You know, th
inking about yesterday, wh at™s hap Œ tomo rrow, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559

know. So many nights of sleep before your
 birthday, you never 
say so many nights 
after your last birthday, you always go forw ard. 
Q: Oh I Œ I have a 13 year old 
daughter, that™s exactly still Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ you know, my  birthday is going to Œ is
 in octo Œ her birthday is in October, she 
just had it and all of a sudden she™s unha
ppy again because it™s such a long time until 
the next birthday. 

A: Yeah. And th e mo ment she is 13 and a ha
lf, she™ll let you know. I™m very close to 
my  childhood, very close. 
Q: How do you explain that? 
A: I don™t know. I think I am still very 
inquisitive, optimistic, fast, impatient, can™t 
wait for things to be fixed,
 I™d rather fix it myself. 

Q: But it also sounds like y
ou™ve had a happy childhood. 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: You know, that™s Œ that™s Œ 

A: I™m still hap Œ I™m still a 
very happy person, yeah. 
Q: How did your brother and sister Œ I m
ean, they were so mu
ch younger than  you 
were, how did they absorb this?  

A: I do not really know my  brother and sister. 
It™s as Œ yeah, this 
is a very Œ it™s a bit 
of a tender subject, in a way. My brother 
is very different from me. We were in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
20
 
 
hiding a little bit, a little time together, he 
and I. But we operate on a totally different 
wavelength. And I love my  brother, but I don™t like him.  
Q: Yeah. That happens in families. 
A: I guess so. But I will not bring the situatio
n to a head, I am very cordial with him, 
with his wife, but I will Œ I do not wish 
to have a closer relationship than we 
currently have. 
Q: And, I don™t want to pry in Œ in that 
in Œ in  Œ in any way, simp ly, was it your 
natures that made you this way, we
re there events that made this Œ 
A: There were events, there were issues, a
nd I would want to discuss those issues, but 
it would be very detrimental to him. I™v
e invented something, I talked about it 
yesterday at one of the sessions, that is calle
d the lock  tight syndrome. Lock tight is a 
schmear
 that you put between a nut and a bolt. 
Q: Okay . 

A: You tighten it, it creates a gasket, a
nd nothing rattles. And 
now we™re going to 
talk about something, and 
th e lock tight is being removed, and then  I leave Œ 
Q: And it happens Œ 
A: Œ and there™s no more lock tight. 
Q: So you™re Œ y
ou™re concerned Œ 

A: I would Œ I would undo a s Œ a sense of 
security that I could 
not reintroduce. I™m 
very sensitive to that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
21
 
 
Q: And is Œ and is that Œ is that related to
 what the Holocaust did, or is it related to 
other types of things with you and him? 
A: It™s related to othe
r things, too, oh yeah. 
Q: Okay . 
A: No, it Œ actually, it™s not rela
ted to the Holo
caust at all. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It is something that Œ that started to
 happen, oh I™d say abou
t 15 - 20 years after 
the Holocaust. 
Q: Okay . 
A: No, no, it Œ it™s definitely 
an adult discrepancy that o
ccurred and I Œ and I wish to 
leave it like that, because Œ I explained it 
to his wife. I don™t want to provide him 
with the feeling that everything is hunky do
ry, but I also don™t want to give him the 
feeling that we™re sworn enemies.
 He just had a vacation in the 
United States
 with 
his wife, they had a camper. 

Q: Do th ey li Œ do 
they live in the 
Netherlands
, or do they live in
 Israel
? 
A: They™re living in Œ in
 Holland. 
Q: In
 Holland,
 mm-h m.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: And he sent me a card for my birthda
y, yet, he didn't call. He went to see 
Niagara 
Falls, Toronto 
is not too far away, we offered to meet him in 
Niagara Falls
, but that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
22
 
 
also implied that we really didn™t want hi
m Œ to receive him in our home. So  I think 
he read the signal right. 
Q: That™s sad. 
A: It™s very sad, yeah. 

Q: It™s sad. 

A: Very sad. 
Q: Did you share anything of a ch ildhood 
together though, that was different than 
this? 
A: I loved him, I mean, he was really, he 
was the little brother I 
always wanted. I had 
an imaginary brother until he came. In my
 fantasy I spoke with him, and I knew 
where he lived. And I forgot about him 
the moment my little brother ra Œ arrived 
physically. 

Q: What™s his name? 
A: 
Arthur.  
Q: 
Arthur. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And your sister? 
A: 
Anita. 
Q: 
Anita
.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Is
 Anita
 still alive? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
23
 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Okay . 
A: She lives in 
Israel
 and she has 16 
grandchildren. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Well, she has three boys, and the boys are fertile Œ nubile 
[indecipherable]
. They 
are wonderful guys, I™m very 
good with them. I™
m Œ actually, my  salvation does not 
rest with my contemporaries, it rests 
with the people who come after my 
contemporaries. My brother™s kids, my si
ster™s kids, my cousin™s kids. They™re 
terrific. They Œ they love me. 
Q: How nice. 
A: Yeah. And my  wife is included, of course. 

Q: Yeah. Do  you have kids? 

A: No. 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: No. As my wife said, it never happened. 
But I was not very ha
ppy with the world, 
I think, all along, and I really don™t mind that I don™t have any 
kids. Having kids is 
also something of a cu riosity, you would lik
e to see what are they Œ wh at it looks 
like. My mother, whose favorite child I™ve 
always been , said to m Œ and who would 
have, of course, 
kvelled
 herself to death about a grandchild from 
Dorothy 
and from 
me, said to me towards the e
nd of her life that she really
 respected the fact that I 
didn™t have any children. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
24
 
 
Q: She understood. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: She understood. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Let™s go back to when you were at th
e summer house with your Œ your family, and 
then your aunts.  
A: And Œ well, all of a sudden, the immediat
e family of my moth
er relocated outside 
of 
Amsterdam
 and we had a good time, and we sa
w each other regularly. In June Œ 
i-in September of 1941, we had to go to  
Jewish schools, so my  coo Œ my  oldest 
cousin went to a Jewish high school. And 
my younger cousin also, and I went with 
my  brother and my  sister to the Jewish 
public school, or Jewish grade school. That 
was a very deceptive thing really, because the kids from my public school really 

didn™t keep in touch with me. The general 
attitude in those years was that, let™s see 
how this thing sh akes out. 
Typical Dutch saying is let us
 not burn out hands in co ld 
water. That means, tak e abso
lutely no risks. And the 
kids heard this from their 
parents, and goodbye 
Leonard. 
Q: So Œ so that mean
t that when you left 
Amsterdam
, there was no one who ever 
called or said, how are you 
doing, where are you going? 
A: No. And when  I went this 
one year to the school in 
Bussum,
 where we lived then, 
nobody kept in touch with me 
after I was removed from school. 
Q: Tell me about that.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
25
 
 
A: Well, one day my father came h o me a
nd he said, I got a letter from the counselor 
for science and education, and he says that
 you™re no lo nger supposed to go to your 
proper school, you have to go to  a Jewish 
school. And well, as kids go, tha Œ here™s 
another page of Œ of intere
sting something or other. 

Q: Did you feel at  the t ime hurt that nobody
 followed up, or is 
this something upon 
reflection later? 
A: No, th at is upon reflection later on, yeah
, because you don™t have time to be hurt, 
you have to sort of find out
 wh at™s going on and Œ so th at Œ that Œ I went there for a 
year, my  brother and my  sister, 
too. And Œ and actually my  si
ster went to a Œ sort of a 
Œ I don™t know what it was, a kindergarten of 
sorts, I think. And then we were told Œ 
no, then, in the fall of ™41, my father coul
d no longer work , beca
use he could not use 
public transportation, and he
 decided to spend a bit more
 time with my  brother and 
me. And on Saturday morning 
we used to go to synago
gue. And one mo rning in the 
fall of ™41, we came back from shul, and a 
man stepped out of hi
s house, crossed his 
garden path and positioned hims
elf in front of my father and said, I™d like to ask you 
a question. And that was a dicey thing 
because you didn't know who the hell the guy 
was and he could denounce yo
u. And he said Œ and my  
father said, okay, ask the 
question. And he said, are you Jewish? And my  
father said yes. He said, I thought so. 
I see you co me by there every Saturday  mo rn
ing with your two sons, nice thing to 
see. I know a bit about Jews because I used to live in 
Amsterdam
, blah, blah, blah. 
He said, but that™s not really Œ that™s not r
eally why I wanted to ask you that question. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
26
 
 
I would like to know what are you going to
 do about the resettle
ment of the Dutch 
Jews in the east? There had been discussions
 that the Dutch Jews were going to be 
evacuated. That was an em
igration departme nt of the Jewish council, and the 
resettlemen t would take place in the ea
st, where that was, we didn™t know. 
Q: Do you mean east 
Holland
, or east 
Europe
? 
A: East
 Europe
, yeah . And it could have been  
Germany
, wh ich was not really 
eastern 
Europe
, but it certainly was east of the Du
tch border. And my father said, I 
don™t know. I Œ my Gentile friends are not ta
lking to me. They want to see how this 
thing evolves, and my  Jewish friends in th
e same boat as I am. And my  brother and I 
were standing th ere, you know, seeing how 
this thing evolved. 
And this man said 
something that is quite incred
ible when you thin
k about it, he said, may I help you? 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And this man knew about discrimination, 
he was a hunchback . And he felt that his 
time had come. There™s certain people who rise
 to the occasion at the appropriate and 
almo st pre-ordain ed time. And this man, 
who had been  discriminated against all his 
life, married to a very nice woman, felt that 
t h is was his opportunity
 to shine. To be 
in charge of something, despite his handicap. 

Q: Did your father accept? 

A: Not right away. He said that I don™t want you to  endanger yourself. I me an, he 
didn™t know wh ich way this whole thing was going. 
Q: He didn't know who he was talking to. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
27
 
 
A: That™s exactly. And the man said, may I co
me to your house and discuss this with 
you? So my father said, sure. And that™s ho
w we went into hiding. I wasn™t privy to 
the discussions, I wasn™t privy to anything th
at happened, except th
at one day in June 
of 1942, after we had been resettled in 
Amsterdam, Amsterdam 
was going to 
become a big ghetto Œ 

Q: So you were back from 
Bussum
? 
A: From Œ back from
 Bussum
 to  
Amsterdam
. In my father™s office, he had two 
floors there. And above the two floors th
ere were three more floors, which had 
tenants. And I think my  father made a de
al with the tenants somehow to keep the 
place in good repair until he came back from hi
ding, because that wa
s the idea behind 
our 
[indecipherable]
 discussion with this man w
hom I shall Œ shall call Uncle
 Bill. 
He got the medal from 
Yad Vashem
 by the way, he 
survived it all. An
d so in June of 
1942, a lady came to the house 
and said, I™ve come from Uncle
 Bill, 
and co me to 
pick up the kids. And it™s Œ it just was 
absolutely unbelievable, the Jews stand 
accused of not having been in
 the resistance against th
e Germans. You know, we 
were supposed to Œ supposed to  have 
been led to the sl
aughter like sheep. 
Q: Well, there are Œ there Œ there 
is that kind of talk. I mean Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ one hears and reads things like that, 
but Œ but there™s mo re
 than enough to 
disprove it. 

A: Yeah. It happens Œ I have 
to watch my  time here, ooh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
28
 
 
Q: Sure. 
A: Yeah, I said at three o™clock I will m
eet somebody at the movies. But we can 
always continue later on. 

Q: We can always continue, yes. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So let™s talk until you have to go. 
A: So, we™ll Œ we™ll talk up 
to in going into 
hiding. So  the lady came and she Œ she 
asked for the kids, and only mu
ch later in life have I rea lized that first my parents 
resisted the Germans physically and ment
ally. Secondly, that they divested 
themselves of their children,
 with out any hope whatsoev er. Or maybe with only hope 
that they would be treated right, that peopl
e would like them, that they would be fed 
properly, in the hope that they would see th
em again. I don™t wish that on any parent. 
It is the most abhorrent thing. 

Q: Do you reme mb er the day? 
A: In June, no, I remember 
when I went into hiding. 
Q: That™s what I mean, that day. 
A: Okay , that was in August, it was the 12
th
 of August. I know that because the 10
th
 
of Au gust was the birthday of my cousin, 
and I went to his bi
rthday party. And I 
went the 12
th
 of August. After my  brother and sist
er left, my  father broke down and 
cried, and asked me if I would look after the 
kids in the event that
 he came to grief Œ 
after the kids and my  mo the
r. So there you stand, 11 ye
ars old, you know, what do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
29
 
 
you say? Yes, Pa. And so I was taken to Œ 
by the same lady, to a 
shack in the woods. 
The summer of ™42 was gorgeous. And I had 
to look after my  own breakfast and my  
own lunch, and in th e main house, the pe
ople who owned the shack, they got my 
dinner. My brother spent a brie
f time with me there, he 
was in between two addresses 
and it was nice to see him. And at that 
time, there was something going on in 
Holland
. I can™t Œ 
Q: Were they in
 Amsterdam,
 was this place in
 Amsterdam,
 outside the ci Œ 
A: No, they were out in the country. 
Q: Okay . 
A: South of
 Amsterdam
. That was a very interesting thing that I™ve only later 
diagnosed  or 
evalued
. And that is that there was a saying the war will be over by 
Christmas. And there is corollary
 to that, that if the war is 
not over by this Christmas, 
then it surely will be over ne
xt Christmas. It meant that
 every Jew in hiding had a 
window of opportunity of 3
65 days, with an automatic re
newal, because if anybody 
had asked will you take 
Leonard Vis
 in, from August ™42 til May ™45, you would 
have had a resounding 
no. So this crazy Christian noti
on, because wars have to be 
end around Christmas with 
peace on earth and all this
 kind of stuff, was very 
beneficial to us. Of course it™s a crazy Ch
ristian notion, but to we Œ it was to our 
advantage. And that™s Œ 

Q: Wait, did you stay in the same place? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
30
 
 
A: No, because the place with 
the Œ the shack wasn™t winterized. So in November of 
™42, I was taken to a very nice family with 
a big house. And we can talk about that in 
the st Œ 
Q: Subsequent. 

A: Œ second part of our interview. 

Q: Okay. We will do that. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Okay . Thank you.

Beginning File Two 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Mr. 
Leonard Vis
, on Novemb er 9
th
, 2008 in 
Alexandria, Virginia.
 
So, Mr.
 Vis, 
where did we leave off? 
A: I left off when winter came, and the shac
k that I was living in was not winterized, 
and my  handlers decided Œ th
ese were friends of Uncle
 Bill Œ 
my  handlers decided 
that I had to be moved to a mo re clement environment. 

Q: Were they kind? Were the people that y
ou came into contact w
ith now, were they 
kind, or were they indiffe
rent, or how were they? 
A: They were very casual about the whol
e thing. To th em I was just a kid who 
needed a place to stay
. The Jewishness sort of didn™t 
figure in too much. I think it 
was important to them that I could lead my own life, they were very intellectual 

people; he was a journalist and she was a 
screenwriter. And they  had a young son, 
and they lived their life in 
the main house, and I lived my  life in the wooden shack, 
and you know, like ever
ybody else, they also thought th
at the war would be over by 
Christmas, and that the
 Tommys
 would be coming. We hadn
™t really thought about 
the Americans, but the 
Tommys
 were close by, and th e 
Tommys
 could do 
everything. And the interesti
ng thing was that they rea
lly Œ you know, they  lulled 
themselves to sleep. They 
thought you could rid of the Germans just  like that, a nd 
that the persecution of the Jews, I suppose wa
s Œ was one of those things that are part 
of the war, and you have to take
 that in stride. I don™t think 
th at after I left they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
32
 
 
engaged in any other illegal activ
ity, but at the time they di
d what they felt, and they 
felt good about it, so Œ 
Q: I mean, but were they indifferent to 
you? I mean, sounds like pretty mu ch Œ it™s a 
certainly Œ not an Œ not even 
a two class syst em, but here is
 the upper house, and here 
way down lo w Œ 
A: Yeah, it was Œ 
Q: Œ you™re there with Œ 
A: Œ it was a fairly segregated existen
ce, which I didn™t mind, quite frankly. 
Q: But it™s the first time you™re really s-
separated from your family™s fa Œ i-it™s new Œ 
A: Well, I™ve been Œ I ha
d been to the children™s 
pensionne
, and this was, to me, an 
extension of that. 

Q: So in  a way it was an adventure? 

A: Abso lutely, yeah, yeah. 
Q: How did you keep  yourself occupied  in that shack? 
A: Reading, crossword puzzles. My mother ta
ught me years ago, long befo re I went 
into hiding, that crossword puzzles are a good 
thing, it™s part of my literacy situation. 
I still do them. And reading. 
And of course I was out in 
the open, so there was a bit 
of investigation of nature. I knew a little b
it about mushrooms that I™d learned in the 
children™s 
pensionne
, so it Œ 
Q: Did anybody come talk to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
33
 
 
A: Yes. A young man joined me there in, I 
guess, October. Very nice young man, he 
Œ for the longest Œ I knew that his first name was 
Joe.
 For the longest time I really 
didn™t reme mb er his last name, his omer Œ 
his honest last name
. Everybody had sort 
of an alias. But thanks to
 a wonderful database that 
has just become public in 
Holland
, I found out who he was, and pretty 
well what happened  to  him. He was 
caught and deported, but he didn't die in 
Auschwitz
 for some reason or other, he died 
somewhere else, in a work 
camp. And the only reason that I found him was that I 
remember the street 
on which he lived in 
Amsterdam. 
Q: He had told you about it? 
A: And 60 years later I look on the databa
se Œ was some 70 years later, I look on the 
database, I type in th e name, and there I fi
 Œ the name of the street, and th ere I find 
him. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah. It was Œ 
Q: How much older than  you was he? 

A: How old was he? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: He was Œ I think he had just turned 20. 

Q: So he was young. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
34
 
 
A: So th at was a Œ sa Œ I had so me a Œ 
that was to Œ actually very nice. And my 
brother came in sept Œ not in oct Œ and my
 brother came in October, I think, just 
briefly. He was in betw een places, and we
 both were Œ we bo
th had s-sores on our 
skin, which had to do 
with the richness of the food that
 we used to get at home. They  
called them gall pimples, they Œ they 
came from your Œ excessive gall bladder 
movement or wh atever. They Œ it all cleare
d up as the diet became mo re sparse, these 
pimples went away, so Œ but I remember wh en  he came to me, and it was nice to see 
him. It was also good to se
e him leave. I have always felt that I™m better to be alone, 
because it doesn™t cramp my style. Not th
at I™m a Œ that I™m a loner, I™m very 
gregarious, but I find it difficult to be in 
a strange environment and Œ and having to 
look after my st Œ after some
body else in addition to myse
lf. Anyway, I left th e shack 
and we were taken to a large home in 
Huizen,
 which was nearby. The shack was in 

Blarikum.
 It™s all happens in Œ in an area of 
Holland
 called the 
Troy
(ph), which is 
southeast of 
Amsterdam, 
a commuting area. And there was a father, a mother and 
four children. Big house. The father was Je
wish, and he did something th at no proper 
Dutch 
burg her
 would ever do. Wh en he was asked if he had four Jewish 
grandparents, he lied. He said no. He was 
married to a non-Jewi
sh woman. He lived 

in 
Huizen
 as I said before. His name was 
Isaac
, and he got away  with it because he 
said no, he didn™t have a 
J
 in his identity card, he di
dn™t wear a star, no nothing. 
Q: And nobody did any kind of i
nvestigation to prove him wrong. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
35
 
 
A: Nothing at all, no. In f
act, we should have taken mo re risks in those days, but we 
didn™t, because we were very law abidin
g. You didn™t do that. If the government 
asked you for something, you responded. He 
Œ but in the summer o f ™42 Œ oh yeah, th 
Œ let me tell you wh at he did. He was into
 magnetism. He was sort Œ some kind of a 
matu re 
[in d ecipherable]
 
lettre. 
He felt that he had precious magnetic powers Œ 
Q: Magnetic fields. 
A: Yeah, and if you had a headache, then he
 could sort of Œ as you can imagine, it 
was not a well paid position. And he was no
t unhappy when  his sister called and said, 
I got my papers to report for resettlement in
 the east, can I sit this
 thing out with you? 
And he to ok her in with her husband. It was his oldest sister, 
Rochelle
. And shortly 
thereafter his brother 
Sa m
 called with his wife, and said
 they got their papers and 
could they come to him, and he said okay. 
And th en two younger sisters of his called, 
each with a son, and he said okay. And then
 I came and Œ well, of course, his Œ he 
was Œ all of a sudden he was the proprietor of a 
B
 and
 B
 and 
L 
and 
D, 
bed and 
breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Q: Oh yeah. 
A: And Œ 
Q: And the pe Œ guests weren™t paying. 

A: No, the ge Œ well, the guests were payi
ng a little bit towards the upkeep. I mean it 
Œ we didn™t pay him for the danger, we 
paid him for the groce Œ it was grocery 
money th at we contributed. 
I don™t know how I Œ wh-w ho 
paid fo r me, but that went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559

through Uncle
 Bill,
 he had these arrangements. I Œ I 
didn™t know anything ab out that. 
At any rate, he Œ he liked it, the house wa
s buzzing, and at the cert Œ  and, oh yeah, 
and I have to tell you that what is very im
portant, you have to ha
ve reliable suppliers, 
because if the family of six persons buys 
six rolls of toilet paper every other week, 
and all of a sudden th e lady of th e house co
mes in and needs 24 rolls of toilet, people 
start to talk . More Jews lost their live
s through loose lips than through all the 
Germans, collaborators and wh at have you. 
The Jews in hiding, that is. So he had 
very good suppliers 
for milk, for vegetables, for gr
oceries, for medications. The 
suppliers were beyond repro
ach, they were good, as we 
used to call them. You™re 
either good or y
ou™re wrong. So Œ 
Q: And there you were on an  equal level. 
You weren™t re-relegated to a shack, were 
you? 

A: No, I had a proper bed and Œ and th ere 
were Œ there was a younger boy, a nephew 
of his at the same age as I was. And then 
people came in with two daughters, and we 
had some mo re youthful Œ a 
mo re youthful element in there. I learned to sing g Œ 

French 
ch an so n s
. I learned to appreciate Dixieland 
music, Swing. This was still the 
era of Swing. I was 12 and I was really bei
ng formed in a very adult environment, I Œ 
I was still a kid, but my inte
rests became rather advanced. 
Isaac Œ Isaac™s
 cash flow 
improved. It was a funny th ing with a man™
s eyes, when the cash 
flow improves, his 
eyes start to wander. And he 
got himself a girlfriend. And 
his wife condoned that, she 
says, you know, the pressure 
on him is hard enough. And 
Isaac
 brought the girl in, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
37
 
 
was a nice lady, and you know, she wa Œ b
ecame sort of a friend of the family, I 
don™t know how amorous the interest was, bu
t of course it mu st have been at one 
point. And 
Isaac
 felt yeah, maybe this was not the 
right thing to do. By that time 
there were about 28 people in the house, and 
Isaac
 said to the girl that, you know, we 
really should sever the relationship because 
Œ apparently  she loved him a lot, maybe 
he was good in bed, I don™t know. But she said, if you want to get rid of me, I™m 
going to  get rid of you. 
Q: Oh dear. 

A: And she walked to the nearest police st
ation and denounced him and said, he has 
28 Jews in the house. That wa
s a very lucrative denoun Œ 
dénouement
, 
denouncement, because for ever
y Jew that you denounced, 
you got the equivalent of 
five bucks in Du tch money, seven and a half
 guilders. That™s all we were worth. So, 
28 times five. Anyway, she lost 
out; we were warned that th
ere was going to be a raid 
on the house. The Dutch police 
came with two guys from the 
Sicherheitsdienst,
 and 
they found the hiding place that
 we had. But before they 
came in they ha
d notified us 
Œ notified 
Isaac
 that they were coming. 
Q: So so me of the Du tch police, or one of th e Dutch police Œ 

A: One of the Du tch police gave 
us warning, and one guy left, 
Eddie. Eddie
 was 
engaged to  a Dutch girl who wa
s not Jewish. So he knew th
at when he showed up at 
her home and rang th e bell, that the door wo
uld open. None of us
 had that privilege. 
So we waited. And I™m beginning to underst
 Œ I began to understand now what they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
38
 
 
mean by mesmerized. You just can™t move. 
It™s a Œ it™s a frightening thing, it has 
happened  to  me one time later in life, th
at you are absolu tely frozen. An yway, they 
came in and they found us, they  didn™t even  ha
ve to threaten to sh
oot into th at hiding 
place, you know, they knew wher
e the door was, the girl 
had told them everything. 
And there we were, 27 Jews, and they didn™
t know what to do w
ith us. This was the 
weekend Œ this was a Th
ursday , Thursday  the 30
th
 of September, 1943. Ro sh
 
Hashanah
. 
This year als Œ this year by mere chance, Rosh
 
Hashanah is al so on 
Thursday on the 30
th
 of September. Calendars seem to repeat themselves. And so 
they took us in a moving van to  a prison in
 Haarlem
, and only on th
e Saturd ay  did 
they move us to the Jewish theater in 
Amsterdam,
 that was a collection point. 
Q: You had been with  
Isaac
 for how long? 
A: From December ™43 til se Œ to say Œ 
til September Œ no, sorry, from December 
™42, til December Œ 
til September ™43. 
Q: So almost nine or 10 months, something like that. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: And had you had an
y contact with your parents at all? 
A: Occasionally. 

Q: So they knew where you were? 

A: They did not know where I was, no. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
39
 
 
A: They didn™t know where I was. 
I got a parcel from th em on my 12
th
 birthday, and 
Œ with all kinds of good stuff in there. Th
at™s where my street smarts Œ did I tell you 
that before the interview? I don™t 
think so. Let me go back to the 16
th
 of September, 
1942. I got a parcel from my pa
rents for my  birthday, had all kinds of good stuff in it. 
And I™m allowed to send a thank you note. A
nd my  th ank you note ran, dear Father 
and Mo th er, thank you so mu ch for the lovely
 parcel with, colon; I enumerated what 
I had received, so that they could check it 
off against what they 
had put in. Because I 
figured in  my  primitive mind, that when yo
u take a parcel for somebody, you want to 
know what™s in it. 
Q: And maybe a few th ings disappeared.  
A: And maybe the person who opens it up says
, what does a 12 year old need  to do 
with dried apricots? Anyway, nothing had be
en removed. They  were extremely proud 
of me, they kept the note against all proper 
judgment, and I have it to this very day. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: They kept it thro
ughout their hiding period, yeah
. They thought it 
was absolutely 
brilliant. 
Q: Well, it was. 
A: They didn™t tell me, but that™s
 what they told me afterwar
ds. So that is when street 
smarts sort of started to surface. I m
ean, it Œ it was developed in the children 
pensionne
, it was honed further in looking afte
r myself and using my brain a little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
40
 
 
bit. Anyway, that™s how long I was with 
Isaac
, from December ™42 til, say, October 
one, ™43. 
Q: So you got the parcel 
only a few weeks before Œ 
A: No, because I turn
ed 13 in September ™43. They 
had a Bar Mitzvah party for me. 
Q: Okay, so you got the parcel Œ 
A: Just after I started being in hiding. 
Q: Oh, I see, it wasn™t at 
Isaac™s 
house that you got Œ 
A: No, no, no, no, 
still in the shack. 
Q: Okay, you™re still in the shack. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: And on the 29
th
 of September, 1943, there was a Œ 
the largest roundup of Jews in 
Amsterdam
 took place. Everybody who was so
mebody, including the Jewish 
council, were rounded up and taken to th
e Jewish theater. So they couldn™t have 
another 27 people mo ve in, and that 
is why we were sent to the prison in
 Haarlem
, 
where they  kept us fo r two days and th en 
Saturday  mo rning the moving van went to 
Amsterdam
 because the Jewish theater had be
en pretty well em
ptied on Friday 
night. They always did things on Jewish 
occasions, the Germans. They were very 
good, very respect
ful. They kicked
 us out of the 
sowber
(ph), out of the Jewish 
theater every Friday  night. They  loved it wh
en there was a Jewish
 holiday that they 
could impose some sanctions. For this
 they were Œ they were very Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
41
 
 
Q: So this Œ 
A: Œ in tune with making life as miserable 
as they possibly could. I Œ I sometime s say 
to people, and not even quite in
 jest, that an awful lot of 
Jews have contributed to the 
survival to an awfu
l lot of Germans. 
Q: In what way? 

A: If you were busy with the Jews, you didn't
 have to go to the front. Anyway, I Œ we 
arrived at the Jewish theater, had a huge el
ectric door. I don™t know why that stays in 
my mind, it wa Œ it was sort of Œ it was sort 
of a finality of things, the Œ a chapter was 
being closed, and the door was electrically
 operated, and you co
uldn™t get at the 
button, so you were in ther
e. Adults to the right, adu
lts register their children, 
children to the left. On
 the left was a Œ sort of a barracks room for kids. There were 
chil Œ cots and beds there. 

Q: Aside from the 27 people wh o you were 
there with, when you
 got to that big 
theater, were there any others that yo
u recognized, that you knew from before? 
A: Well, I come to that. I™m still
 in Œ I™m still in the lobby.  

Q: You™re in the lobby, okay. 
A: And I™m going to  the children™s barracks room. I put my  satchel down, I had 
some, you know, some travel gear
 in there, toiletry stuff, a pair of socks, maybe even 

a pair of shoes, but not mu
ch else. Underwear, I remembe
r. And I go into the main 
auditorium, the seats have been remove
d. The balcony has been closed off 
completely, because people we
re jumping to their death from there because they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
42
 
 
didn™t want to leave 
Amsterdam. 
And there I see my Uncle
 Henry 
and my  Aunt
 
Betsy.
 They were not really an aunt and uncle,
 but they were friends of my parents. 
And they  Œ yeah, they  were 
such good friends that you ca
lled these people aunt and 
uncle. They were very surprised to see me
. They asked me how things were going 
with the family and I hush-hu
sh told them that I guess ev
erybody Œ everyone is all 
right, but I have been caught. So , Uncle
 Henry
 says, well, let me 
find out what your 
status is here; if I am a puni
shment case, or if I am a regu
lar arrival, or how did they 
Œ  
Q: Did anything happen to
 Isaac
, by th e way, for having ha
rbored so many people? 
A: 
Isaac
 was interrogated by th e 
Sicherheitsdienst
, and to the best of my 
knowledge, he agr
eed to become a 
fowman
(ph), that is, a Œ a confidence man for the 
Sicherheitsdienst. 
In other word s, he would betr
ay other people. But I™ve never 

heard that he actually engaged in  anything. 
He was not deported either, to the best of 
my knowledge. But I did not seek a ny contact with him after the war. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I really didn™t even kn
ow how to do that
, how to position my self. And so Un cle 
Henry
 came back from the administration of 
the Jewish theater, and said, they™ve 
never heard fr-from you, ab
out you or of you. 
Q: So you weren't on 
any pieces of paper. 
A: I was on no piece of paper. I was a victim
 of German administrative rigor. If you 
have children, they must have parents w
ith them. I had no parents, and th ank God 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
43
 
 
nobody volunteered to register me. So I wa
s there totally illegally, I had no business 
being there. And Un cle
 Henry 
said, we have to get you 
out of here post-haste, 
because if we don™t, then we are in troubl
e. You are in trouble. If your Œ they empty 
the place on Friday night, if 
they find you here on Saturday
 morning, they say hey, 
who are you? 
Leonard Vis
. Never heard from. Oh, we mu st have overlooked you, 
they put you on the list a
nd your turn is next Frid
ay. How to get out? Uncle
 Henry
 
had a plan . He said, find yourself a young b
oy your age, become friendly with him. 
And wh en th ese people are being called 
out on the Friday night, midnight, the 
Germans want to get this over with really
 quickly, they  don™t 
count the members of 
the family. As long as the family
 moves, that™s fine with them.
 Schnell, schnell
 
und 
schnell. 
Aunt 
Betsy
 and Uncle
 Henry
 had a visa for
 Cuba.
 Of course, no boat in his 
right mind was going to  
Cuba
 in those days, but it helped , because 
Germany
 was 
not at war with 
Cuba
 and 
Cuba
 was not at war with 
Germa ny
. They also had a 
special privilege in that th
eir maid could bring a pot of hot food every day to the 
theater. Not only that, both Un cle 
Henry
 and Aunt 
Betsy
 got a hardboiled egg each. 
And Aunt 
Betsy 
put a note in the dirty pan and asked the maid to put in three 
hardboiled eggs from now on, 
because one was for me. I do not like hardboiled eggs. 
I really am not a great egg fan. I don™t lik
e the smell of eggs. I mean, if an egg is 
scramb led, it™s fine, but a hardboiled egg, 
I™m definitely not a friend of. However, I 
found a nice kid. I asked him where his pa
rents were, he had 
two brothers and a 
sister. And I said, do you like an  egg? Oh,he would love an eg
g. So, every mo rning 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
44
 
 
thereafter, you know, we found each other a
nd I gave him my  egg, which made for a 
very good friendship. So
, on th e Friday night, was 
Kol Nidrei
, the eve of Yom 
Kippur. We were preparing to be move
d from Œ those who were eligible for 
expulsion, let me put it
 that way. Not Uncle
 Henry 
and Aunt
 Betsy
. But we who 
were eligible for expulsion made ourself rea
dy to  be taken by stre
etcar to a railroad 
emplacement, and from ther
e, in a nice, third class carriage train to 
Westerbork
, 
which is on the Dutch-Ge
rman border, which had a 
transit camp for further 
processing. So, midnight, I™m hanging around
 the place where my young friend is as 
well. They call out the name of the family
, the family storms out of that room. 
Q: Do you reme mb er the name? 
A: No. Don™t remember his name. Very stra
nge. Been Œ been trying to, but I don™t 
know. I could fake it, but I honestly don™t re
memb er his name. It was all too intense, 
I think, you know, you had 
to Œ to process in your 
little brain in Œ whatever 
information you could. Anyway , outside a st
reetcar is waiting. It™s midnight. There™s 
a curfew in 
Holland
 from 10 in the evening til six in
 the morning, so there are no 
people watching. The streetcars take us to
 the railroad emplacemen t. There™s a train 
waiting and I ge Œ I lost my  friend and his fa
mily in that process, because everything 
has to run and 
schnell
 and soldiers there, police there,
 and I end up in a compartment 

and I tell the people once we™re all seated, that when the train leaves the station, I 
will jump from the train. And 
the reason that I could do th
at, I explained to them, was 
that I™m not on anybody™s list. The roll ca
ll will not be impaired, nobody will miss 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
45
 
 
me, nobody doesn™t even know that I™m here
, but this is the on
ly way for me to 
escape. 
Q: So you™re in the 
Netherlands
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: This is all still in the 
Netherlands. 
A: Still in 
Amsterdam
. I had an address in 
Amsterdam
 of people who I had Œ a 
woman who I™d met at 
Isaac™s
, who said, if there™s ever any problem, you can come 
see us. I had her address. That address I rememb er, because that was critical 

information. So the train star
ts off, it™s about three o™clock in the morning, it™s pitch 
dark, Yo m Kippur. And it™s a choo-choo train, doesn™t start up that quick ly. So, a 

little bit outside of 
Amsterdam
, I decide to make my getaway, I land fortuitously. I 
land on a Œ on a Œ on a Œ on the railroad bed 
at Œ on the side of the bed, and I roll 
down. I wasn™t a big deal. But I™m stay put, I check my  limbs, I have a pee, because 
I™m nervous as hell. T h at much I remember. 
And then I have to wait until it starts to 
dawn , because I need daylight. I have my  
trusted Swiss army knife with me, they 
existed in those days. Not stainless steel, 
but regular steel. And I™m not looking in the 

Swiss army knife for the knife, but I™m look
ing for the scissors to take off my star 
from my coat, fro
m my jacket, fro
m my  swea ter Œ  
Q: Oh my  gosh. 

A: Œ even  had the star Œ star Œ I had to sew it on my self, th Œ so I made sure that it 
wasn™t all too tight, but it was Œ it would 
pass a cursory inspection. I had money in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
46
 
 
my  pocket, and I decided to wait Œ I also had a watch, and I decided to wear 
Omega
 
watch. On e of the big, round jobs. Grandfat
her™s watch, sort of. 
And I decided to wait 
til around nine o™clock, because before th
at time, what would a young kid walk 
around there for? So I walked 
back and there was a Œ the e
nd point of a streetcar, and 
ma Œ you know, I™ve lived in 
Amsterdam
, so I knew where to go. And I arrived at 
number 12 
[indecipherable]
 at the family 
Bon, b-o-n. 
They were happy to see me, 
and they said th Œ you™re ju
st in time because we are 
going to a soccer match this 
afternoon and we have a spar
e ticket. And as a child in
 hiding, you are comp liant. 
You don™t make waves, you d
on™t say anything nasty, you 
don™t refuse anything, if 
they Œ 
Q: You don™t say, I don™t feel 
like going to  a soccer match. 
A: No, no, no. You always feel
 like doing whatever they 
want you to do. They also 
called me 
Theo
, that was my  hiding name. My name is 
Leonard, Leo 
in Dutch, and 
they felt that 
Leo
 was too Jewish. Who am I to dispute that? So I was 
Theo. 
My  
brother™s name is 
Arthur. 
I always thought it was a rath er Gentile name, but they 

thought it was too Jewi
sh, they called him 
John. 
So I was 
Theo. 
And years later you 
wake up, and you find out that th
ere have been 13 Popes called 
Leo
. Much too 
Jewish, you know, much too Jewish. I™m tel
ling you th at Œ it™s an illustration of a 
certain depersonalization. They
 know everything, I am nowh ere. I am living a known 
life. I am living a known existence. They 
have all the knowledge about life, I have 
nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
47
 
 
Q: You feel that then? 
A: Oh yeah, absolute
ly. If they say that 
Leo
 is a Jewish name, then 
Leo
 is a Je wish 
name. There™s nothing I can do about it. I™m totally dependent on them. I mean, it 

was a nice soccer match, and nobody caught 
me, but it was, of course, the stu p idest 
thing to do. I™ve done other st
upid things in order to plea
se my caregivers, but I won™t 
go into that, it™s not that important. I survived
 it at any rate. I stay
ed there for about a 
week, and they send out word 
to my handlers that I needed
 a place to go in to hiding. 
Q: Were they kind to 
you, or were they Œ 
A: Very, very nice. Wonderful people, ab
solu Œ and no money chan ged hands, they 
were first-rate. The father worked for Œ th
e father of the lady work ed for a chocolate 
milk factory, so every day I got my  ration 
of chocolate milk. I don
™t know how he did 
it, but Œ and I Œ and the neighbors were ve
ry nice, they Œ they
 lived, I think the 
second story of a house. And th ere was a balc
ony that went along the second story to  
the house next door second story. So, if 
there was any kind of 
a round-up, you could 
move via the balcony, by a co
al bin from one apartment to 
the next. That I remember. 
Q: Did th ey point out Œ that out to
 you, or did you 
figure that out? 
A: No, they told me. 

Q: Okay . The reason Œ you know, one of the 
reasons I ask this is
 that when you™re 
talking ab out how th ey wanted you to Œ to  call you
 Theo
, it™s with a certain, you 
know, tone of Œ I wouldn™t Œ 
don™t know what the right wo
rd is, but it™s not a positive 
word . And maybe, in their minds, th
ey were very sincere. That Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
48
 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Œ that they thought there would be greater
 danger. Whether it™s t rue or not, maybe 
they sincerely believed that. 

A: Yeah. I understood it to be a 
de-Judai-Judaization of my  name. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Not for any Œ not to cha
nge my  identity, but to un-J
ew my identity. In other 
word s, 
Theo
 sounds Gentile, whereas 
Leo
 sounds Jewish. 
Q: In any other time, in any other circumstan
ce, that could be offensive. But in th at 

circumstan ce, where they don™t want you to 
be caught, then anything th at could save 
you from being caught Œ 

A: I agree. I mean, I™m not agains
t it, but the funny thing is that 
Leo
 is a very 
Catholic name. So what do you Œ 

Q: Yes, I know, the Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ the irony, and the silliness, perhaps Œ 

A: They could have called me 
Derek
 or something Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ you know, but Œ  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ yeah . 
Q: Or Œ or not. I mean Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
49
 
 
A: Or not, yeah. 
Q: Or not, because if it™s that kind Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: I-I-It™s ju Œ that™s why I as
ked, were in other ways th
ey kind? It Œ because there 
would be some people who might
 have just not liked Jews Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ and wanted to Œ 
A: I just finished watching the movie about 
Walter Süskind. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And the Œ the rescue of the children from 
the crèche. When I ca
me into the Œ into 
the theater, the crèche was already clos
ed. And there was a comment about the 
rescuers, all young people, 
young students, that there was a sense of cowb oys and 
Indian s among them. And I think that sort 
of permeated the Œ this sense of renaming 
me. Could be, I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So the call went out for people to 
take me in, and the greengrocer stepped 
forward. He was 25, she was 23, they had 
a four year old boy, and she was pregnant 
with her second child. 

Q: My. 
A: And he said Œ he didn™t even  consult 
with his wife Œ they
 knew me from w h ere I 
had been caught, and he cam
e home at night and said, 
Theo
 is coming to stay with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
50
 
 
us. She didn't even know th at I had made
 it back, he explained to her that I was 
available for adoption. And 
she said, when is he comi
ng, she says, tomorrow? He 
said no, not tomo rrow. He said, why? He 
says, tomo rrow™s my  birthday and I want to 
have an unencumbered birthday. 
I don™t want to have a kid 
here that I have to hide. 
Why was that? The house that 
they lived in was Œ the re
nt was two dollars a week. 
The house was one of five houses in a little
 Œ  round a little courtyard. And I asked the 
school kids, is there anybo
dy here who knows or can gu
ess what you would not get 
for two dollars a week in a little h ouse lik
e that? And eventually someone says, a 
bathroom, Mr.
 Vis. 
I said, you got it. And wh at do we 
have instead of a bathroom? In 
Canadian parlance, an outhouse. An
d an outhouse can wreak havoc on the 
kishka s
 Œ 
on th e innards of a kid in hiding. But they
 found something fo r that, because I could 
piggyback on the four year old™s potty for 
my little business. But as far as my big 
business was concerned, my innards c
ould not become active until well after 
sundown. Because in order to
 use an outhouse, you have
 to go out, and I was not 
allowed to go out unless it wa
s dark. Under the cover of 
darkness, with a little hand 
dynamo  so I could Œ hand dy
namo  so I could see where I Œ where I was going. And 
so I tell the kids that, I said, you have a 
freedom that you™re not aware of, a very 
important freedom. And that™s taking a shit 
wh en you bloody well want to. And that 
cracks up th e lot. And Œ  
Q: But Œ 
A: Œ and I said, you™ll think of me tonight.

Q: But you know, that™s t
ough f-for anybody and especia
lly tough for a young boy. 
A: Yeah, exactly Œ 
Q: It™s very tough. 
A: Œ because you want it all now. So I™ve le
arned Œ you also learned patience in that 
respect, you know, regulate yourself somewh
at. Wonderful people
, absolutely first 
rate. He was 25, she was 23. She is exactly
 10 years and one month older than I am. 
So, I arrived there on the 17
th
 of October, 1943, and I had 
been  exactly 17 days out of 
circulation. Or, 17 days in the open 
befo re I went back  into hiding. 
Q: And what happened to the people who 
were in the theater? To your uncle Œ 
A: My group? 

Q: Œ to your uncle and aunt
 who were family friends Œ 
A: Uncle
 Hen r y  
and Aunt
 Betsy 
ended up in 
Belsen,
 and where they perished. 
Perishing is the right word, they were not
 necessarily murdered
, although you can 
call it murder, because fo
od was withheld. The people that
 I was caught with were all 
murdered in 
Auschwitz
 on the 23
rd
 of October, 1943. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: I™m the only survivor. 
Q: Oh my , from that house? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you know the name of th
e woman who was the girlfriend? 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
52
 
 
Q: So sh e has that many souls on her head. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Maybe more. 
A: You know something? Revenge was the 
furthest of any Jews mind after the war. 
There were some people who went out to kill some people, but they had a extremely 

valid reason. Who was I? Lucky to be aliv
e and keep moving. At any rate, I had a 
very wonderful time with these 
people, they were very go od to me. I shared a bed 
with a young boy, four
 years old, who could not tell an
ybody that he had a 13 year 
old pseudo brother parac
huted in to his bed. Played with
 his cousins in 
the street, in 
the courty ard. Saw his grandparents, who liv
ed around the corne
r, regularly, his aunts 
and uncles. This is little fi
shing village, you know, in 
Holland
, where everybody 
knows each other. And he had his 
nervous breakdown at age 55. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you think th ere™s a conne
ction betw een that and that? 
A: It proves, you know, that there is no 
free lunch. That™s all it proves. He was 
offered some psychiatric help, but he knew
 how it came about, and he knew what he 
had to conquer and he did it hi
s way, and he is fine now. 
Q: Did he make those connections? Did Œ is 
he the one who said it™s because I had to 
keep quiet when  I was a Œ when  I was a young boy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
53
 
 
A: We think that that was Œ he doesn™t really
 talk about it, he n Œ he knows wh at it is, 
and I know what it is, yeah. Yeah. No free l
unch, not even for a four year old kid. 
Q: But that a four year 
old kid could manage that. 
A: That was the miracle. Kid was a miracle, absolutely. 
Q: And so even grandp
arents didn™t know? 
A: Nobody knew. On ly his mo ther™s oldest
 sister knew, who wa
s into undergro und 
work  herself, and her youngest brother knew.
 Nobody else. Who also  had people in 
hiding.  

Q: But that™s i Œ it™s an amazing feat. Becau
se if you had Œ given 
the Œ the geographic 
Œ how you describe it Œ 

A: The geography was Œ was a killer in a sense, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Yeah. And he went to scho
ol, and he Œ an d his mo ther had instructed him, and she 
had said that if they find out that 
Theo
 is here, the Dutchers will co Œ the Germans 
will come and get him. 
Q: And he protected you? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: Did your parents 
know where you were? 
A: My father was in terrible 
shape in the f Œ around Chri
stma s ™43. He was underfed, 
he was depressed, and he really needed a 
change of déco r, change of environm Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
54
 
 
Q: Were they still back in the Œ in his 
own office building? 
You know, when you Œ 
when you had left Œ 
A: No, no, we Œ no, they went into hi
ding a week after I went into hiding. 
Q: Okay . Togeth er with your brother and sister? 
A: No, they went first, they went in June. 

Q: Okay. Oh, that™s right
, they went in June. 
A: I went in August, and my parents, I th
ink, went in September, or beginning of 
September. And my  parents stayed together, 
my  sister went to her Œ on her own, and 
my  brother went on his own. An yway, my  fa
ther was very depressed, and his Œ and I 
call them h andlers, it™s sort of the easier 
way to describe them Œ came to my war 
father and said, listen, 
Leonard, 
or 
Theo™s
 father is really in 
bad shape. Can you put 
him up for a couple of weeks? And 
there came my father, who was so 
undernourished that he was almo st paranoi
ac about things. And 
they got him good 
food, there was always plenty to eat th
ere, because the man was a vegetable Œ 
Q: Grocer? 
A: Œ grow Œ not Œ vegetable merchant. Po
tatoes. And they gave him some booze, 
which he never drank, my fa
ther, but that sort of cheered him up a little bit, and we 
had a wonderful Christmas and New Years. 
And I enjoyed being with him, or he 
enjoyed being with me, and he
 deferred to me. Whenev er he wanted  something, he 
used to come to me first, and said, do
 you think this is okay, can I do this? 
Q: That™s a big burd en for a young child Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
55
 
 
A: Because I was the landlord, in a sense, you know, I Œ  
Q: You were stronger than him. 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, ab
solutely. Well, that came about,
 because when  he broke down 
after my brother and sister left, which I referre
d to in this interview, he asked me if I 
wanted to Œ if I could look after Mother
 and the children if he perished. And of 
course I said yes, wh at else can you say?
 Bu t it changed my  relationship with him 

very profoundly, in that I became mo re of a 
daughter to him, when I can define care 
between a woman an d a man, a man cares diffe
rently. A man is sort of hey guy, how 
are you, with a knock to the shoulder, wherea
s a daughter is mo re kind, softer. And 
my relationship with my  fath
er absolutely becam
e that of a father and a daughter. I Œ 
I looked after him. I™ve traveled with hi
m, I™ve washed his sh
irts. It w as a most 
unusual relationship. With my  mo ther I™ve 
always been a buddy. My  mo ther and I 
operate on the same plane. We™re tough, we
™re street smart. My father is totally  
different.  

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: But you had a lot of growing up. 
A: Oh yeah, pretty fast. Anyw
ay, I Œ he left be Œ middle of January, fortified, cheered 
up, and th at was well, the main thing. And 
then  I was sent out of the house in May 
because my war mother gave birth to a little
 g irl. And I came back after three weeks 
with a very intellectual family, which 
I relished. There was music, there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
56
 
 
intelligent conversation, which I didn™t have
 with my war family
, which they sensed. 
And my war mother said to 
me, in the beginning th at I was there, that of course I 
came from a different milieu, and they woul
d try and find another place for me. And 
she told me that story, I have comp letely
 Œ comp letely wiped that out of my  mind, 
and I mu st have said I™m very happy here
. You don™t have to do anything. Bu t the 
offer was made Œ they were sensitive to th
e fact that I d id, indeed come from a 
different intellectual milieu. My 
father was not a greengrocer.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mu st have been very shocked by th at
 offer, so I Œ and I declined, I said it™s 
absolutely not necessa
ry, I™m very happy he
re. That™s what she told me. Not that it 
was so easy to move a child, especially 
a dark haired Jewish boy. Circumcision 
played a big role, because regular kids were
 not circumcised. So I came back and my 
war mother said, well, here she is. And I le
arned how to look after a baby, and except 
for breastfeeding, I did everything else. 

Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: The kid grew up to be a magnificent gi
rl. She™s now grandmother of six kids or 
something, has four children of her own. 
And we™re very close.
 She™s very proud, 
I™m her older brother, not the Œ not her ol
die Œ her oldest brother, I am. And she™s 

very proud of the fact 
that I looked after her. 
Q: And how long did yo
u stay with them? 
A: Til May ™45. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
57
 
 
Q: So actually, from the ti Œ from October 17
th
, 1943, correct? 
A: Yup. 
Q: For another year and a half, yo
u were with them until liberation. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: My goodness. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: My goodness. And Œ 
A: They were very good to me. They Œ towa
rds the end of the war, well, in Œ in the 
winter of ™44, my  parents and my  sister came
 to stay Œ my father
 came to stay with 
me again, and they found a pl
ace for my mother and my sist
er to sleep, but living was 
all in that little two dollar house. 

Q: At what time had the place been Œ the Œ 
the countryside been 
liberated already by 
the Œ the allies? 
A: Well, there was a partial liberation from 
beneath the big rivers
, and that was in 
September ™44. 
Q: And you were above those rivers? 
A: We were above the rivers, yeah. We
 were not really liberated, we were 
surrendered.  
Q: Ah. Ah. Okay, so you s
till had danger until May ™45. 
A: My father, may he rest in peace, said 
on the day of liberation, nobody leaves the 
house. Because a stray  bullet can undo what
ever we have been trying to preserve. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
58
 
 
Q: I think that™s very smart. 
A: My friend who is here, his fath er got ca
ught up in some kind 
of a wild melee of 
joyful, festival celebrants, and was pushed under
 a streetcar, lost his leg. So my father 
was very, very wise at that moment, he Œ 
actually, he did a fantastic job in Œ in 
reestablishing th e fami ly, I™m beginning to  see that now. 

Q: What happened th en , after the war? 
A: Well, the general feeling was that Œ an
d I speak about that, every returning Jew 
presented an  economical miscalcu lation.
 Oh, are you still around? We were not 
welcomed. It was a very cold and chilly wind.  

Q: How awful. 
A: Yeah. The queen had said 
that to her every Dutchman
 was the same except, of 
course, there were certain Dutch people wh
o had suffered more and differently than 
other Du tch people. That was not taken into c
onsideration. I™ve just finished a talk to 
an Anglican church, where I was asked to
 speak about my ha
ppenings during the 
war, and I find that among adult audien ces, th
e Holocaust has been beaten to death a 

little bit. So I decided, after consultati
on with a friendly minister in the United 
Church of 
Canada
, and director of the Anglican c
hurch, that I would rather speak 
about the holocaust afte
r the Holocaust. And the headin g of
 my talk was, I have been 
liberated, but am I free? Because th
e war against the Jews continues. 
Q: Tell me about those experiences, tho
ugh. Did your father have difficulty in 
reestablishing his business? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
59
 
 
A: My father had to face an unfriendly bure
au cracy, to get a house, to get bedding, to 
get furniture, to get stuff in  order to put his family under a roof. Instead of three 
children, he all of a sudden had fo ur child
ren, because we took in a cousin  whose 
parents had been killed in 
Auschwitz
. He had to put four 
children in school by 
September one. And last but not least, 
he had to restart his own business. 

Q: That Œ the place where his business wa
s, did he get that property back? 
A: He got Œ that property was kept by th
e tenants, yes. But, you have to have 
merchandise in order to  do 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: That™s right, that™s right, that™s right. 
A: You know, that didn™t Œ an
-and you couldn™t travel. He didn™t Œ he didn™t have a 
car 
[interruption]
  
Q: Okay , he didn™t have a car. 
A: So he Œ my  father had a hell of a task
. He is not a strong man, he is a very 
civilized, almost meek indivi
dual. And I never thought all 
that mu ch of what he had 
to go through until a friend of mine, 
Isaac Lipschits
 wrote a book in Dutch called, 
ﬁ
The Little Shoah
,ﬂ in which he really details, as
 a professional political scien tist 
and historian, wh at happened  to the remn
ant, and how did the 
remnant cope. There 
were people didn™t want to 
have anything to do with 
Holland
, hightailed it off to 
Palestine
 and that was it, if they had the perm
it to do so. So my father reestablished 
us. I don™t think we ever gave him the cred
it for it. I™m sure I gave him the love, but 
it wasn™t based on what he ha
d done, it was really based on 
our relationship. But this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
60
 
 
interview comes to a very nice note, becau
se in 1951 my  war parents had another 
son. They  had two go Œ daughters in betwee
n Œ no, they  had one daughter in between 
Œ two daughters in between, yeah, they Œ 
then  they got a son. They named him 
Leonard.
  
Q: Rather than 
Theo . 
A: Rather than 
Theo
, yeah 
Theo  
was Œ went overboard  very rapidly, yeah. So, there 
is Œ yeah, and 
Leo Hoyer
(ph), that™s his last name, has a son who is called 
Michael 
Leonard. 
Q: That™s very nice. You maintained
 contact with them after the war? 
A: Oh yeah, oh y
eah, absolutely.  
Q: And your parent
s, did they Œ  
A: Well, no, there was a time when I was not
 in contact with them, and they  didn™t 
mind. They fi Œ these people were actually, fo
r the Œ the social stat
us that they had, 
uncommo nly bright. They were not on 
my case. If they heard from me it was 

wonderful, and if they di
dn™t hear from me, 
they would ask my  parents what™s 
wrong. 
Q: How is he doing, yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So they were very good
 to me in that respect. 
Q: And your parents, were they Œ di
d they have good relations with them? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
61
 
 
A: Oh yeah, excellent. Yeah, he was Œ he 
went into the army after th e war. He was 
three years in
 Indonesia
. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And he could do that because he knew 
that my father would look after his wife. 
Q: When  the war ended, 
you were then how old? 
A: I was 14 and a half. 
Q: 14 and a half. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you were in the middl
e of your teenag e years? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you remember what you
 felt in those pors Œ postwar years? Di Œ when you 
went to school, did you feel that kind 
of co ldness at school? Did you feel from 
neighbors and from Œ did you know Œ 
meet people you had known before Œ 
A: No. I Œ what happened w
ith school, my mother, ambiti
ous as she was, said well, 
because of the Œ the winter, you w Œ everybo
dy got a year free, and she managed to 
get me into the second year of high scho
ol, wh ich was not right, in retrospect. She 
didn™t want me to lose too much time. Bu
t it didn™t wo rk out that way, I was a very 
fidgety ch i Œ fidgety child. I had trouble conc
entrating, I had Œ I was very fearful of Œ 
[interruption]
 So  Œ 
Q: You were fidgety. 

A: Hm? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
62
 
 
Q: You were fidgety. 
A: I was fidgety , I did not finish high school. 
Q: Were you unhappy during those times, t
hose Œ when  you were saying you were 
fidgety, was it the Œ after all of that sort 
of like close brushes with death Œ you know, 
there™s this phenomenon, wh en people finally 
are in safety, everything th at held them 
together during the times of crisis Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ kind of Œ you Œ then
 you allow yourself to Œ 
A: Well, I Œ no, there were 
so me g ood  times.  I b ecame a  memb er o f  th e sea sco u ts, 
which I enjoyed hugely. Since I had not ha
d physical pleasures, being a scout was 
wonderful, travel was wonde rful, doing things was wonderful. Cerebral stuff was not 
part of that. 

Q: And you were growing up, actually, in postw ar
 Euro pe
, which is unusual. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Not many people stayed around. 

A: Right. 
Q: And I sense that you don™t have great warmth for
 Holland
. 
A: No, I have Œ I can truly say that I have
 a culinary homesickness, but that™s about 
it. I worked in 
Holland
 after I got married. M y  wife married me on my decent face 
and good character, whatever was visible. Bu
t I Œ I was rather fearful of that and Œ 
that she™d know where I cam
e from. So, we went to 
Holland
, I spent seven years in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
63
 
 
Holland
, in the advertising business, which was at that time my  Œ my business. And 
those were not Œ those were 
happy days wh en I was allowed to run my  own agency. 
They were not happy days wh
en I was part of the person
nel. Because their style Œ 
you see, th-the Œ the problem with 
Holland
 was that the Dutch 
did not go through a 
renewal. They wanted restoration. And ther
e, that is the crucial difference. Renewal 

is opening th e windows and letting in a fresh 
breeze. Restoration is, let™s go back to 
the status quo an te. And that is what happened. 

Q: And some things, you can™t go back  to. 

A: Well, they tried. 
Q: When did you leave 
Holland
? 
A: In ™54. I finished my military service,
 and I wrote Œ while I was in the military, I 
wrote Œ and I loved the military. I was a 
damn good soldier. I Œ I was good. I c Œ 
physical again, you know, I 
could improvise, I could st Œ 
use my street smarts. And I 
wrote to an uncle of my  cousin in 
Australia
, and to a cousin of 
my father™s in the 
United States
, if you Œ they would sponsor me, and the cousin in th e 
States
 came 
through first. So that™s why I went to the 
United States
. 
Q: Where did you settle? 
A: In
 Westchester, New York. 
Q: And how long di
d you live there? 
A: Until I went into the army. 

Q: 
U.S.
 Army, then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
64
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So you went Œ you™ve been
 in the Dutch army and the 
U.S. 
Army? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What was Œ what was your Œ what wa
s your Œ what military
 branch did you go 
into? 

A: Well, I ended up in the military  police. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Because I™m literate and my Ge
rman was good, I was stationed in 
Austria 
and in 
Germany
. 
Q: And what years? 

A: ™55 - ™56. 

Q: Oh, those are very 
interesting times in 
Germany
. 
A: Yeah, right. 
Q: And very Œ still very 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Hungarian Œ Hungarian revolution, yeah . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. So Œ 
Q: And, can you tell me a l
ittle bit about how Œ I mean, th
is is not that much long 
after the war. What Œ what kind of
 impression did yo
u have of this 
Germany
 of the 
1950s? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0559 
65
 
 
A: Well, of curse Œ course, no German had 
ev er been a Nazi, and Œ and that is, of 
course, true, because only five percent of 
the Germans were card carrying Nazis. I 
did come away with a bit of an appreciation for 
wie haben es nicht gewusst.
 We 
didn™t know anything about it. But there is
 also very ti Œ because you cannot really 
sense that two blocks down  the road they  ha
ve a roundup of people
, they Œ they Œ it™s 
too f Œ too far removed. 
[interruption] 
Q: Œ or towards, you know, in the first Œ 
A: Yeah, I had no problem being in 
Germany
 or in
 Austria
. I had been with  the 
Du tch  army  on  man euv ers in  
Germany
. I don™t know, I Œ I don™t think I Œ I was anti-
German at all. I love the German language
, fo r one. To tell you th e truth, wa Œ a-and 
my holocaust is limited to 
Holland
. I™ve given all my  books about 
Schindler 
and all 
of that to the Jewish library  at the Holocaust Center in
 To ronto . 
My knowledge o Œ 
my holocaust took place in 
Holland
. And the reason that 
Holland
 had such a large 
loss percentage, is really due 
to the civil service, which ca
rried out its orders to the 
letter. To the police, to the 
burg omasters,
 to the officials in th
e civil registry, I think 
the Jewish council that is being blamed in
 Œ all over the place, had very little to do 
with whatever there was. If they hadn™t be
en  there, it would ha
ve Œ it would have 
taken place anyway. So, I Œ Ilike to exonerate the Jewish 
council. They brought a lot 
of solace to a lot of people who were destin
ed to die anyway, and they Œ they did the 
best they could under the circumstances. Yo
u are not trained to su rviv e these kind of 
things. You learn on the job.

Q: You™re absolutely right. 
A: Yeah, so it Œ and I told you about th
e lo ck tight syndro me. I don™t like to ask 
people about what they went through. 
If they want to tell me, fine. I™m not 
volunteering Œ I™m not trying to  in Œ to indu
ce them to volunteer info rmation. I am on 
a number of boards. I am on the board of 
Dying with Dignity . I am on th e board of 
my  professional Financial Planners Associa
tion. I am on the board of The Ho lo caust 
Center of 
To ronto . 
I am 78 years old. I don™t look to
o bad and I don™t feel too bad, 
and life™s okay.
