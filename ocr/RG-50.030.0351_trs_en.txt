Q: Let 's  st op for  a mome nt beca us
e there's a truck noise. 
 [Pause]  Before t h
e Czech terri tory was 
occ upie d, were you a w ar e of wh
at wa s going on in Ger ma ny?  
A: Yeah.  Because we hear

thought about was Auschwitz
.  No, I  didn't know i n  that  ti me  
tha t  it wa s Ausc hwi t z t her e.  Just  
persecution, kicked them
 out.  My sist
er who was there for 30 years,
 she didn't have citizenship, 
so she had to leave in 
half an hour.  No
body needed citizensh
ip, so we knew it's troubles.  We  
kne w.  But  not i n t hat , i n that Œ how 
you sa y it?   In that  e nd, you know. 
Q: You probably didn't think that
 what  was  ha ppeni ng in Ger ma ny 
was  ne ce ssaril y goi ng to ha ppen 
to you. 
A: Oh, no.  We  didn't Œ no, we  coul

beca use  they kne w t he y had t o pas s my house . 
 They didn't  s ee me  beca use  I  was  hi ding t here , 
but they still knew I am 
someplace.  In that sm
all place everybody wa
ved because they knew 
each ot her , and I had a lit tle st ore, 
mill inery st ore.  So 
everybody knew me i n 
t hat village, i n t hat 
city.  But we never 
thought that Ausc hwitz was the 
answer for those deportations. 
Q: Now,  you said that in
 1939 was  when you real l y 
became aware of all of 
t his bec ause your si ster

Q: Wh en  wa s thi s?  

A: In 1939 it started automatically, little by little.  And 
then they had those sw
astikas.  And I had in 
this a sign in my  store, "Jew."
  Everybody had to put in their 
st ore a sign t h at was fr om t he

 Very, very horrible time. 
Q: Were ther e act s of viol ence

happen? 
A: They reported them.  
You have Œ no, they

 the city in that 
place  wh ere I was .  No  more Je wis h b oys  le ft  a n
d no men.  An d that was my
 last time that I was 
among the last to survive 
there still hiding.  Wh en
 my friends, as I said
, they waved to me, you 
know, t hat  they are i n that
 transport.  They had to re port , a nd I  di
dn't re port.  I  di dn
't go to repor t.  
Every single girl had to 
come to report, and so they took th
em away.   But I didn't, so I we nt 
hidi ng first , and then I 
escaped, you know, at Pesach

And I was kos her  a n d I  went  e ver y

 But normally, yo

  And so Adler, we met 
in the res taur ant  occa sionall y, and he  sai d, "Her e 
are your papers, and her e  is your
 money.   And I  have  a plac e wh
ere  I li ve , you c an come to live

, we  di d not suppose  t o ta

didn't  know each ot her , t hat t hey shouldn't  suspect

lucky, he oc
casionally 
gave me  mo ney.  An d then
 t o t he  end it wa sn't good anymor e either
.  So he  le ft his  Œ I didn't li ve  
there anymo re.  I had t o
 find a new pl ace.   
 
02: 05: 02 

 
How did I fi nd a new pl

in Rothchilds Œ in 
that elite salon, ar
istocrats.  And I 
a m going home , and my collea gue, 
my g i rl,  wh o wa s wo rki ng  wi th

"You know my  housewife" Œ how
 she  sai d?   "M y l andl ady Œ la ndl

came from someplace
, and I cannot stay
 there tonight. 
 If you could 
take me, I will sleep on the

st t o have" Œ 5 o'clock 
is cur few.  You cannot 
be on t he street .  So 
she  let me, a nd that  was  my good
 luck and I stayed with her. 
 But  it  was  al ready bombi ng, 
constantly bombing it was 
on and on and on.  I don'
t know if you want th
at part now.  And I 
staye d Œ t hre e Je wi sh Œ her br ot her-i n-law a nd he

in the same building 
toget her .  There wa s uns e l fi shness

wh en is Yo m Kippur?"  She knew I am Jewish
 Œ didn™t  re port  me , and s he  Œ unbelie vable how 
uns el fis h t hose people  we re whil

lice of bre a d or wat er, it  was  
like l i fe save r, a nd they di dn't c are
.  They ga ve me  j ust as muc h as
 they had.  We  
should come to 
the bunker how everybody 
had to be curfew and bom
bs were hitting the city
 constantly.  And in 
a cert ain hour or  a certain ti me, t hey were an
nounci ng eac h da y, when we
 ha ve t o go in the 
bunker.  Bunker, you 
know what is a bunker?  So  we went 
i n t he  bunker one t i m
e  in t he l e ngt h of 
three  months .  Di dn't  go out, di dn
't go i n.  And one girl says, "I 
c an't  st and it ,"  a 
young woma n.  I  
just see her in fr ont of 
my mi nd.  "I have  to get  water."   " D
on't  go, don't go, s w

hit her and s he ne ver ca me  back.  J u

it was just such 
a criti cal ti me, people are Œ and t hat

  And one  day I a m sta ndi ng

we lived on the first fl oo

up to the first floor.  
Not permitted, everybody had 
to be downstairs, but si

 we went up.  And I 
am standing in fr ont of the

 you know and all window

coul dn't eat;  we had

bombed out.  You could st

that war, and I will 
tell you, you have t o li ve.  We  ha

 war."  But that was 
so silly.  That was 
very sill y t o hope. 
Q: After you were living 
wit h t he Chri stian pa per s
, did you ha ve  to do a nyt hi ng di fferent l y?   Did 
you have to pretend you 
wer e Christi an?   Di d you ha ve  to
 cha nge  your  li fe style  at  all?  
A: Well , I  di dn't have t o cha nge  
too much becaus
e I didn't have any lifestyle.
  Makes simp le as that.  
I ha d no li fe s t yle.  Fr om mi
nute  t o mi nute , I  don't  know wher
e I am.  I'm wo

some body suspect s 
you, I run a wa y.  No mone
y, no job.  Toda y I ' m sl

where I am t o morr ow.  I  don't  even
 know where I am toni

Q: But you didn't have t o go to churc h orŠ

Q: So during all this period, were
 you able to in any 
wa y c ontinue your r elig
ious  obse rva nces  or  
practi ces? 
A: Well, the kosher restaura
nts were still open until 
it was open, but then it 
was closed.  So then I 
ate anyt hing I could.  But  whi le I  
was a maid in that same period of
 time , I didn't ea
t, but they ate 
por k a nd st uff like  t hat.  I  just pic k
e d bread and stuff whic h i s kosher
 for  me , but  it wa sn't kos her .   
Q: So even with all of these hardships, 
you tr ied t o re spe ct your tr aditi on . . . 
A: Yeah.  I wouldn't do it 
anymore.  If I think of 
it now, it was so silly.  
And, you know, 
that nicest 
part was, I  di dn't have t o do it.
  I  di dn't ha ve  to obs erve  acc
or di ng to the  ra bbis.  I  c oul d do 
anyt hing I  wante d t o.  It 's  a style , 
or , I  don't  know, wa y of li fe, I  guess .  
Q: Whata bout holi days?  

A: I we nt to synagogue one day, 
and in that same time a friend wh
ere  I wa s worki ng, s he  ha d a big 
cross all  the t i me.  And one da
y I came to her Œ nobody wa s ar
ound us Œ I  s a id, " Are  you 
Je wish? "  And she says, "No, I a m
 not Je wis h."  And her e I  we nt 
t o s ynagogue , and s he  is there .  
So in s yna gogue , I  used t o go 
in Doha ny Ut ca , i n what i s no
w a museum.  I  us ed to he ar  
wonder ful  le cture s by Dr. Heve si
.  He wa s a wo nderful lecturer.  
It wa s so quiet wh en he wa s 
talking, and I was so imp r
essed with him.  An d th
at  was  like  a  hi ding place , no place  to go.  It 
wa sn't safe  either.  It 
wa s public, it was Œ never 
public places they didn't 
a dvise us to be .  We  
wer e s uppos ed t o be  hi di ng all t he  ti me  s o meplac
e where nobody would see 
us.  So I  we nt t o t he  
synagogue and to the sh
ows , t o t he  theaters  I use d to l ove  to 
go.  I  thought  I 'm sa fe i nside .  I don't  
have to fa ce too mu
c h public out side. 
Q: This was all while you were 
still a Hungarian Jew, 
or this was after yo
u got your Christian 
papers?  
A: It wa s continue, but you see th
e synagogue wasn't  anymore on.  It
 wa s a  ghett o, a nd t hat 's t he  end 
to t he synagogue. 
Q: Di d you e ver go int o t he ghetto?  

A: To t he end when I ga ve 
that woman that slice of 
bre ad.  No, I di dn't wa nt
 to go in.  It wa s t oo 
risky.  In that little bit wh
at I went in with the gate
s, open gates, it was no
t advisable.  I couldn't 
help the m. 
Q: But you knew what 
was happening inside? 
A: Oh, yeah.  Oh , oh, we knew.  
We  knew, yes.  That's it's  ghet
to, everybody knew that that's a 
ghetto; it's  no picnic.   
Q: Di d you f eel at  all  confli cted
 about that?  Th at you were runn
ing ar ound as a  
Cat holic  and yet  
your people were in th
is horrible condition? 
A: Yeah.

Q: What did that feel  like? 
A: It wa s like a stone.  You can'
t  thi n k.  You feel  l i ke a st atue, 
t hat it 's  not you.  How ca n you 
survive and watchi ng them?  An
d you can't do anythi
ng about it.  Wh ere 
can you turn?  The 
whole  worl d is qui et.  Nobody care s, a nd we wer e a
ngr y.  We wer e very mu
ch a ngr y, not onl y on 
the whol e world, t hat  they let  so
met hi ng like  that happen.  But we  
were  als o  angry, i f  I  may say, 
in that time when 
Jewish people 
were still all right that
 they were so
 indifferent.  They were so 
indi fferent.  The y didn't r aise, we  di dn't hear  a
ny sc rea ming, di dn't  ha ve  
any help fr om a n ypla ce, 
and we felt very, very bad 
about  it, a ngry.  We  wer e
 angry.  Si mply ver y, ver y a ngr y t hat  we  ca n 
sit i n nice war m pl ace, 
and I™ m star vi ng and fr eezi ng 
to death, had no shoes.
  One hole was snow 
and the othe r  one we nt  out the  s n
ow.  So it was anger and s uc h  ho
pel ess nes s.  Can't  do a nyt hing 
for them.  And when I sa w those pe
ople, I said, "Thank Go d.  Wh at
 do I have  to 
co mp l a in?   I ' m 
vacati oni ng."  That 's t he way I  fe
lt .  I 'm on vacati o n.  Wit h all 
t he tr oubles compar ed to t hem, 
unbelie vabl e . 
Q: At this point did 
you have  any mor e c ont
act with your fa mily? 
A: Oh, right away, no.  I 
wr ote r ight away when I ca

He  ha d to hi de i n t he  bunker, a nd whe n he ca me  ou

 With his papers he is 
lost.  So, after he looked a little
 better, his brother decided that
 he will ask his General friend Œ 
Chr i stia n.  He was  wor ki ng in th

And he  ga ve  hi m a pa per  that he  re que sts fr om

So I ga ve hi m the  pape rs  and he

because it's 
open to the

Œ and he s aid s o ma ny

 so ma ny and so many

noticed that they 
want to call the

I  run out .  How I did that , I don'

 was my  lucky 
star i n t hat  ti me that I  coul

  You could have  course

So  when sh e came  to the

 So you c oul d ma ke  your se lf anything you

the morning, 
breakfast, a little cereal
, tiny milk, and that was 
it.  You were hungry cons

rations you got, you got 
there.  But many people
 ma na ged s o me  wa y t o make  money.  Some  wa y 
that t he y wouldn't  ha ve  t o be hu

 hungry.  You didn't  
have to starve to death, but it 
was n 't  e nough.  And th
en the clothing, you co
uld get free.  So  you 
didn't  ha ve  a ny worrie s ho

and rooms were free, of co

 My cousin and me and he

it  was such hopelessness th

Only one solution wa s offered, that

 That was the hope, t h

was 'til 1947.  It wa

friends went to 
a cit y cl ose by, a bigger  ci ty.  
Günz bur g or Ul m.  And I we nt t o 
say good-bye to 
them.  I didn't 
have my  identification card Œ 
identification on me  
fr om t he DP camp al
ready, American DP 
camp.  They picked me up 
in that, in that truc k, three soldiers
.  Here, you go in th
at truck.  Took 
me  to jail .  Can you i ma gi ne how 
stri ct  that  was before?  Amer ican
 soldiers did it
 to me; put me 
with the prostitutes in Ul

enough I have to be with

Œ i t  was  a court , 
t he court made  a,

, " Well, where  woul d I  get  $50? "  $50 is  li ke 
$50,000 t o a  pers on

.  I  said, "I  ca n't give  
you $50.  I 
don't have

said, "I  bail you out ." 
 In the, in the, in

On the fl oor, 
you could sl eep

Q: I think you had wanted to me

A: Well, the Communists liberated, so

and to me  they were great

"Da vai  chl eba.  Give me  brea d."
  The y didn't  as k me  who I  a m .

wood off Œ c ut t he t ree  off, a nd car

 But they were alwa

And t he n ﬁYou ha ve  a wa tch?   Da va

Davai chasi."  They put it here 
on elbow fr om top till dow

ﬂ that means give me  your watch.
  The y didn't wait , they j ust

They said, "Why sh

one  of the be st sa lons.  And I wa
s watching what others do, I obse
rve d bec ause I  ha d to.  I  ha d t o 
compete wit h ever ybody. 
 So I was l o oki ng how t o ma ke  th
e mo st, and that 
was jealousy ma ny 
time s.  One wo ma n said, "Yesterd
ay a wo ma n was here.  She wa s 
much worse than you ar e, and 
they hired her."  But they let me
 go because t he for ela
dy didn't  wa nt me .  And the n i n Buda pest  
wh ere  I wa s wo rki ng  o ne  ti me,  I  ma
de  a hat , desi gned all by myse
lf.  And that de
sign hat  went  
all over  the c ountry, had order s. 
 And the woma n said, "Cut off a 
certain part of the head.  It 
should be better."  I 
sai d, "Don't c ut i f off.  It 's  pe r fect a s 
it is."  "No, you do
 it."  So then the 
forelady comes in, and she 
said, "Who killed that ha
t?"  And she told it's 
me.  She didn
't took it 
on her sel f be caus e t he for elady t old me to c orrect  
it .  I wa nte d t o  lea ve t he  st ore.  That  was  the  
Eur opean.  But t here was jealousy 
i n j obs .  As  a foreigner, that 
what I noticed.  But I work at  
ma ny pl ace s, the y were s y mpat heti
c wit h me .  They wa nt  me t o c o
me Saturday to work if I want 
mone y, e ven it 's  not  right but  I 
s houl d come .  Ma ny pla ces  I wa
s lucky.  I didn'
t notice any anti-
Semitism while I was 
wor king.  I  made  frie nds  whil e I was wo
rking, good fri ends.
  I  di dn't ha ve  
that problem with them, 
j ust t he  jeal ousy was  mor e a  pr obl
e m.  Wh at I noticed.  Th ey we re 
scared of it .  If I met so
mebody?   Yes ,  I did.   
Q: How l ong di d it  ta ke you?  
A: When I c a me i n, I wa s e nga ge d. 
 Wh en I came to this
 country in 1947.  Ye
ah, I met some body in 
Ger ma n y.  I  have his pict ure her e. 
 An d I came  out and he wa nt me  
to c o me bac k a ft er t w o years .  
I said, "Oh, no way.  I 
changed and you changed. 
 Two year s, i t 's t oo muc
h.  You l ive d t hrough; I  
lived through.  I ' m 
not  going bac k t o mis ery a gain.  I don't  
want to go on rati
ons ."   And s o t hen 
he married and I married, 
too.  Oh, my 
brother lived in Wa
shington, had a little
 store.  And I 
lived in New York, so 
I c a me t o visit  hi m.  And I wa s he
lpi ng hi m li ke  a Europea n s i ste r , 
cleani ng hi s jewelry and wa shi ng his  fl oor , wa shi n
g his wi ndows .  Li ke  
at  home .  And a ma n 
came in, three customers, and th
ey said if I am single, they 
have a ma n for me.  And I  wa s 
talking on the teleph
one, he 's a  musici an, a  fr
iend from Europe, fr om Br no
 where  my sist e r was.  
And he  be longe d t o my s i
ster 's c ongre gation.  Whe n he wa s 13
, he alrea dy pl aye d violi n, he 's a  
violi nist .  And I  was  tal ki ng to hi
m, I  wa s al ways  very ha
ppy to talk to hi m. 
 So anyway, he said 
they have  a  ma n for  me, and I sai d
, "Okay, so let me  meet him."  
To me  Œ my brot her  had a date  
wit h a  gir l, I said, "I 'm not going 
wit h you on your  date .  I nee d a 
ma n for mysel f ."  J ust  not  to be  
wit h hi m, not to spoil  hi
s  date .  So t he n my hus ba nd I  met in 
his  cousi n 's pla ce, in his  brother-i n-
law's .  My husband didn't want  to
 c o
me  to my br other 's  pl ace , bu
t he said he wa s goi ng t o his 
brot her™s  Œ brothe r-in-l a w's brother  li quor  store 
i n Wa shi ngt on.  I  sai d, " Oka y, he 's  not c o mi ng 
here .  I a m going t here ."  So my 
hus ba nd ca me , t he n he t ook me  to his  brot he r Œ he 's  a la wyer i n 
Fairfax, he wa s.  No w, he's  ol
d a nd si ck.  Burstei n , Robert  Bur s
tein.  And t hey 
thought  I would 
be good for  hi m, you know, for  hi
s brother.  So  in five days, he
 wanted to marry me.  He  was a 
very set ma n, he always knew wh
at he  want s t o do Œ what wa nt  
to do.  And I  fe
lt like he's very 
reliabl e and character  is great , an
d I don't me et a ma n every day li
ke that.  So it 
took me five 
mo nths to make up my  mind.  In
 Ja nuary '51, we  got mar ried.  
He  was  an e conomist  a n d a  ra bbi , 
he mi sse d but maybe  a ye ar or  s o me

 pers on li ke huma n be ing, s o 
that was my good luc k. 
Q: Do you have  chil dre n ? 
A: I have t w o girls .  One  is Miri a m and t he other 
i s  Susa n.  She 's marri ed 
10 years, ma

And she thinks that that

wa sn't cr az y.  I  kne w wha t  I a m
 doing, I knew exactly wh
at I  a m doing, tha t  it 's not  a ba ll ga me  
for me .  I  know I  a m goi ng in th
e top of the atom bomb, it can 
expl ode e ver y mi nute  when I  a m 
stepping i n or be fore  I ste p i n, be cause  the  build
ing was surrounded
 by t he  Nazis.  Why I  did it, I 
have no ans wer  for  it .  I really 
don't know why I did it. 
 I just  had something 
in me  said you have 
to do it and no question. 
 You ha ve to do it,
 and I  didn't feel I  a m do

 I just did wh at I have to do.  
I wa s there in that mi nute they

wa s tough.  If I lose 
my life  there, maybe I 
would l ose  it  regardl ess .  That  
wa s my
 ide a, but I  wasn't c r az y. 
 I  kne w what I  a m doi ng.  And I 
didn't  pla n to get  mone y for it , didn't  t hink of
 it .  And I 'm ha ppy I 
did it, very ha ppy.
