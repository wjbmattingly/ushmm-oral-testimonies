We begin
 
with this photograph of a very young Esther Star obin bor n Es ther  Ros enfeld.  
 
 
Es ther was  bor n in Germany, wher e the ar row points  on this map of Eur ope.
 
 
She was  bor n in Adels heim , a town north of Stuttgart, and the arr ow points  on this  m ap.
 
Es ther was  the younges t of five c hildren.  In this  photograph we s ee her brother, Herman, her mother,

and her older s isters  Bertle and Edith, her 
father Adolph Ros enfeld, and her  s ister Ruth.
 
 
On November
 
9 and 10, 1938, a violent anti
-
J ewis h Pogr om  known as  Kr is tallnac ht, the Night 
of Brok en Glas s , ins tigated pr imar ily by Nazi Par ty officials  and Nazi Storm Tr oopers, took  plac e.  The 

Pogr om took place throughout Germ any, par ts of Czec hos lovakia and Austria.  In the photograph

Conc er ned about the s afety of their fam ily, the Ros enfelds  r egis ter ed their  c hildren for  a 
Kindertr ans por t, the inform al nam e of a r es c ue effort that br ought thous ands  of r efugee J ewis h c hildren 
to Gr eat Britain fr om Nazi Germ any between 1938 and 1940.  The arr ow shows  the r oute of the 
Kindertr ans por t. 
 
 
Es ther wor e this tag attac hed to her c lothing as  she traveled from  her hometown of 
A
dels heim, Germ any, to Thorpe, Nor wic h, England, to join her Foster family, the Har ris ons.
 
 
We c los e with this  pic ture of Es ther  and her Englis h Fos ter fam ily:  Alan, Dor othy and Harry 
Har r is on.
 
 
Es ther c ame to the United States  in 1947 s ettling in Was hington, D.C.  She attended the 
Univer s ity of Illinois , then had a teac hing c ar eer  spec ializing in Wor ld Studies  in Montgomer y County, 

Maryland.  Es ther 's hus band Fred pas s ed away in Apr il 2011.
 

 
Es ther and Fr ed have two daughter s .  Judy is  an attorney.  Debora
h founded The Handmade 
Afghans  Project to "br ing c omfort and war mth to our  wounded s er vic e member s."  Initially, m ost of the 

afghans  went to Walter Reed Ar my Hos pital but then als o wer e s ent to a num ber of other  m ilitary 
ins tallations  including For t Sam Hous ton in Texas , Fort Br agg in North Carolina, and Bagr am  Air Bas e 
in Afghanis tan. Their goal of m aking 10,000 afghans  was  met and exc eeded in 2013 and this am azing 
pr oject ended. About 1,600 people nationwide wer e ultimately involved in m aking afghans  for 
this effort.  
Es ther was  very involved with the pr oject.
 
 
Es ther and Fr ed have two grandchildr en.  Jon has  jus t finis hed his  junior year  of c ollege and 
Drew is  gr aduating fr om high sc hool and will attend USC in the fall.           
 
 
Our audienc e today inc ludes  Es ther 's daughter Debor ah, as  well as  Es ther 's niec es  Renee 
and Tamar 's s on Solom on. They are in the fr ont row.
 
 
Es ther's  volunteer wor k  at the Mus eum  has involved helping to expand the Mus eum's  
c ollec tions  of doc um ents, photographs and other item s.  Es ther has  been a c ontr ibutor to the Mus eum's

as s oc iated with this museum .  Following today's  progr am , Es ther  will be available to s ign c opies of 
"Ec hoes  of Memory."
  
 
With that I would like you to join m e in welc om ing our Fir st Per s on, Esther Star obin.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Esther, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us and your willingnes s  to be our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
and for  having a number of your  family m ember s join us  today.  That's a real honor  for us  and for you.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  It's  wonder ful to have them here.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll start bec aus e you have a lot to s hare with us.  You were c learly very young when 

your  parents s ent you to England.  And although you wer e too young to be able to give us  fir s thand 
inform ation about life in Germany for  your  family at that time per haps  you c an give us  a sens e of your 
hom etown of Adels heim  and your fam ily befor e the tim e of Kristallnac ht and before your  pa
r ents ' 
dec is ion to s end you and your  s is ters  away to s afety.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Clear ly I don't r em em ber  anything about that bec ause I was  2.  But m y fam ily lived 

in the really s m all town, Adels heim .  It's still r eally  s mall.  I wouldn't r eally c all it a
 
town.  It has  one 
tr affic  light.  Not very big.  My father s old food and gr ain to the farmer s .  He los t a leg in the Firs t Wor ld 

War s o my mother helped him .  He had trouble getting on and off the c ar t, es pec ially when it was  bad 
weather .
 
 
There were, as  you s aw in the pic tur e, five of us  childr en.  My s is ters  have told m e they had a 
r eally happy life before Hitler  and all of that kind of thing.  They went to the loc al s c hool.  There was  a 
very s mall s ynagogue.  About 10 other J ewis h fam ilies  in the town.
 
 
At the beginning, onc e my s is ters  wer e not allowed to go to sc hool, they went fir s t to live with 
s om e aunts, go to s c hool, and then for  s om e reason they went elsewher e to go to sc hool, to Aac hen.  

My brother was  too young.  It's m y niec e Renee's dad.  He stayed with his  par ents in Adels heim  as  I did 
until I went on the Kindertrans por t.

> > Bill Bens on:  A c ouple of mor e questions  about the life with your  fam ily r eally befor e you wer e bor n 
and then your fir s t c ouple of years .  Your father , you m entioned that
 
he was  wounded in the Fir s t World 
War.  He had fought for the Germ an Arm y.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  He had.  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  family had been establis hed in Adels heim  for a ver y long tim e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes.  I was  jus t looking at s omething last night.  My fam ily had been in that ar ea, 

not in Adels heim but wher e m y older  s ister was  bor n, fr om the 1700s.  They had been in Germ any for a 
long tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  200 year s  establis hed in their  c omm unity.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes.  Ver y long.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about your father 's bus ines s  and then tell us  what happened to his 
bus ines s .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Ok .  It was  a fairly c ommon oc c upation for J ews , I think , in Ger many at that time.  

One of the gr andfather s  had
 
been involved.  They s old grain, ar ranged an oc c as ional trade of a c ow or 
hor s e.
 
 
At s om e point, around the tim e I was born in 1937, one of the far mer s didn't want to pay for 
hor s e
 
--
 
I don't k now if it was  a hors e or  a c ow, one of thos e anim als, and star
ted a s uit.  The r eal 
feeling is that was  the beginning of the time that the Nazis  were trying to clos e down J ewis h bus ines s es  

bec aus e there was  no validity to this  s uit.
 
 
The bus ines s  was  als o in m y m other 's name.  I'm not quite s ur e why that was .  That I
 
als o 
r ead las t night.  And I'm  not really s ure why it was  in her name r ather than m y father's other  than the 
fact they pr obably owed s om e money on the hous e s o m aybe ther e was  something about getting a loan 
for the bus ines s.
 
 
They had a c art.  They went out and did this kind of thing.  Of c ours e, once the war  ac tually 
s tarted, the bus ines s was  c los ed.  They had no way of doing this .  And the farm ers  had no way of 

getting grain.  So it didn't wor k  really well for anybody.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e the baby 
am ong the girls . 
 

> > Esther  Star obin:  I was  the baby am ong the fam ily.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Among the fam ily.  What was  the age range of your  s is ters and your  brother?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  My oldes t s is ter  is 12 years older, s ec ond s ister a year and a half yo
unger  than 

her .  The other one was  s even years older, Renee
 
--
 
s even year s  older than I.  And Renee's  father, m y 
br other, was  four years  older than I was .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your oldes t s ister, Bertle, who liv es  in Maryland, jus t outs ide of Was hington, at ag
e 
12
 
--
 
at 12 year s  older than you, s he would know a little bit fr om a firsthand experienc e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes.  For a long tim e s he wouldn't talk about muc h that happened in Germ any.  

And then after a while ther e were c er tain s et s tor ies  we us ed to
 
hear.  We heard about the stor y of 
Edith gradually eating the c ookies  one by one fr om the fr ont r oom where they wer e hidden for the 

c om pany.  Mos tly the s tor ies  were about Edith, dropping the br ead s he was  taking to the c omm unity 

baker y and s he s topped to
 
play s omewhere and dr opped it in the creek. 
 
 
My father appar ently was  very s trict with them.  They weren't allowed dangerous  toys .  Now, 
danger ous  was a sc ooter , whic h appar ently one of the uncle has  given my s is ter .  The hous e they had 
was  on a hill.  T hey wer en't allowed to have anything that went fast down the hill.  I think  it was  bec aus e 
m y father had lost a leg.  Apparently when they were out playing, it was  tim e for them to c ome hom e, 
he would whis tle them and they would all c ome running.  I don't 
know
 
--
 
thes e ar e the stories .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Hitler took  power in 1933.  1938, of c our s e, Kr is tallnac ht oc c ur red.  That event, that 
terr ible event, c onvinc ed many Ger man J ews  inc luding your  par ents  that life under  the Nazis  was  likely 
to get even wor s e than it had been.  Do you know m uc h about the impac t of Kr istallnac ht on your  own 
family and what that meant onc e Kr is tallnac ht happened for your fam ily? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin: What I do know, when the people c am e thr ough Adels heim
 
--
 
appar ently they 
starte
d in one sm all town and tr aveled and picked up people in other  towns .  They burned the 
s ynagogue, took  the s crolls  out.  But my parents ' hous e was  off the Main Street and they were not 

4 
 
par ticular ly bother ed that day.  Ber tle, Edith, who was  living with aunts  at the tim e, they went off to 
s c hool bec aus e it was n't like now where you knew ever ything that was  happening r ight away.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They wer e off in the other town.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah.  And they apparently started off for  sc hool and s aw the
 
s ynagogue burning 
and wer e told to go home.
 
 
At the s ame tim e, living with my aunts  who I never met, I didn't know these aunts, they told me 
ther e us ed to be people that would be in the house at night and they were gone in the mor ning.  So 
pr es umably the aunts  were helping to smuggle people out of Ger many.
 
 
My s is ter Edy, who loved food
 
--
 
s he r emember ed things  about food, talked about going 
ac r os s the bor der and c om ing back  with things  tuc ked into her undies  that they br ought ac ros s the 
bor der.  They pr ob
ably had to.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The border into Belgium ?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah.  She mentioned c hoc olate but I imagine ther e were a few other things, too. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned the burning of the s ynagogues.  There wer e hundr eds  bur ned 
thr ougho
ut Germ any.  But the s ynagogue, if I rem ember right, in Adels heim  was  not burned.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  It was  burned but I don't think  it was  destroyed. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was n't des tr oyed.  Ok.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I think  it's  s om ething els e now.  I don't
 
think  it was  ac tually destroyed.
 
 
In Senfeld, a little town about 10
 
m iles  away, what was  a s ynagogue is  s till s tanding and has 
been renovated.  Ther e's als o mus eums  about J ews  and J udais m  ther e.  And there's s ome rem nants .  I 
don't know what happened to that.  I never ac tually heard what happened to it at the tim e.
 
 
I think
 
--
 
ther e's a m an in Ger many, in Adels heim , where I c om e fr om, Reinhar t, who bas ic ally 
when I don't know s omething, I s end him  an e
-
m ail and he'll wr ite m e back .  He has  looked up the 
his tory of all the J ews  in Adels heim .  He has extens ive rec or ds  of that.  He has  built this  mus eum .  He 
taught s c hool.  He had a little after s c hool c lub with s om e students and they did a lot of his tory and 
inform ation about Adels heim .
 
 
What's  inter esting a
bout Reinhar t
 
--
 
m any things, but his  father was  a Nazi and his  m other 
was  very worr ied about him  getting s o involved in the J ewis h his tory that maybe it would m ake him go a 

little nuts.  But it has n't. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You might towar ds  the end talk m or e
 
about Reinhart, too.
 
 
Of c ours e, on that night, Novem ber
 
9 thr ough 10, as  we m entioned, hundreds  of s ynagogues 
were burned, 30,000 J ewis h men wer e arr ested and taken to c onc entration c am ps .  So s oon after that 

in 1939 your par ents m ade the extraor dinar y dec is ion to s end their  daughters  on a Kindertransport to 

England.  First, tell us  what a Kindertrans port was  and what you c an, what you put together about 
how 
--
 
about how they arr anged that. 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Ok .  Fir s t of all, the only government that
 
s aid they would ac c ept people was  the 
Englis h gover nm ent.  And Par liament agreed to ac c ept c hildren who wer e tr aveling alone from 
Germ any and Austria and a c ouple of other plac es  as  long as  they did not plan to stay.  They wer en't 

s uppos ed to stay in England.  There was  a fee paid to the Ger man gover nment to get them out.  So in 
England they had J ewis h gr oups arranging this  and then people tr aveled to Germ any to arr ange it.
 
 
My s is ters  wher e in Aac hen, whic h is cons ider ably bigger than Adels heim, and they 
traveled 
together in J une of 1939. We had an aunt in England who had been ther e quite a long tim e.  She 
worked
 
--
 
did hous ework  for  people.  That was  the only thing s he c ould do as  an imm igr ant.  So s he 
knew a lot of people this  way.  She arranged plac es  
for my sister s.
 
 
My older s is ter, Bertle, lived
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c ome to that, I'll s top you for a m inute and ask  you a c ouple of questions .
 
 
Do you know why your  s is ters went s epar ately fr om you?
 
> > Esther  Star obin: We weren't living in the s ame plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .  So that was the reason?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  As far  as I know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You went s ever al months later .
 

5 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then do you know how it was  ac tually arr anged to get you out?  Do you know if 
ther e was  c os ts your  parents  had to bear at all?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I don't know as  m uch as I found out and as m uc h as Reinhart has found out, that 
we hadn't been able to.  You s aid you would as k me later , but I was , too.  Clearly I didn't
 
tr avel alone.  I 
have no idea who took car e of m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The c haper ons .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I don't know that.  I don't s eem to be able to find that out.  So I'm kind of thinking 
m aybe I don't need to know it. 
 
> > B ill Bens on:  Ultimately I th
ink about 10,000 c hildren went on the Kindertrans por t.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah, they did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Up to about age 16 I think was  the oldes t age?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  And s uppos edly older  than I was  but I think , like everything els e, ther e wer e 

p
r obably people older  than 16 and r eal babies.  I was  2, s o I was n't a r eal baby.  I've r ead s tories  about 
people just r es ting a baby into the tr ain into s omeone's  hands.  
 
 
I c annot s eem to find out exac tly how this  happened.  With all of this, m y br other was  not part 
of this. 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  Bec aus e of the age of your  s is ters, did they ever  des c r ibe what it was  ac tually 

like to go on the Kindertrans port? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  That's r eally inter esting.  My s is ter Ber tle s aid s he remembers  nothing
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your oldes t.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  My oldes t s is ter .  The only thing s he r em ember s, s he had her ears pierc ed the 
night befor e she went bec aus e it was  an old wife's  tales if you had your  eyes , your  eyes  didn't go bad.  

She does n't wear  gla
sses, so what can I say?
 
 
Edith r emember s c r oss ing the line out of Germ any and being given oranges  and c hoc olates.  
As  I s aid, s he r em embers  food.  Ruth, I don't know.  She never  talked about it to m e.  I don't know if 
s he ever  told
 
--
 
m y niec e is  s haking her  head.  She never talked about it.
 
 
So I don't r eally know.  I find it hard to believe.  My  s is ters  wer e sm art women.Why they didn't 
r em em ber
 
--
 
I gues s  it's a ps ychologic al thing 
--
 
why they never talked about it, why they didn't 
r em em ber, why they weren't willing to ans wer ques tions  when their kids  asked ques tions.  And they 
r eally wer en't.  So I don't know what it was  like.  And I don't r em em be
r . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You don't r emember .  And it was  J une when you went.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  J une of 1939.  Mine was  ac tually arr anged, I know, by Quakers. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I have a c opy of a c opy of the letter that the wom an who
 
pic ked m e up in London 
to my foster par ents  asking if they c ould c om e to the tr ain s tation whic h they c ouldn't; they lived in the 
s ubur bs .  So I know
 
--
 
one of the tim es  I went back  to England I met this lady.  My fos ter par ents  wer e 
s till s om ewhat in c ontac t with this  woman.  
 
 
So I k now how my s is ters  got their loc ations.  My fos ter  father  worked in a s hoe factory owned 
by a J ewis h m an.  And this  man had posted a s ign on the bulletin boar d was  anybody willing to tak e a 
kid, one of the c hildr en that was  com ing over.  So they had one s on and they had wanted another boy 
but that didn't work  out.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This is  the Harr is ons wher e you went?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your s ister s were alr eady ther e.  You were s tarting to tell us  wher e they went.  And 
then you arr ived in J une.  Tell us wher e your s is ter s went fir s t and if you know who ac tually met you, if 
you know anything about that when you got to London.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Ok .  My older  s is ter  Bertle lived with a c ouple that had
 
a plac e in Sc otland.  At 
s om e point they went up to Sc otland.  She finis hed school in Sc otland.  And back
 
--
 
onc e s he was  16 
s he c ame to live with m y  aunt and went to work.
 

6 
 
 
At one tim e a polic eman knock ed on the door and they s aid, "Do you know this  per s
on?"  She 
didn't r ec ognize the name.  It turned out the m an s he had been living with was  ac tually a s py for  the 
Germ ans.  And when they had been up in Sc otland, he had been watc hing the planes  and s ending 
inform ation back  to whoever
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So a c over for a s py, taking in a J ewis h r efugee c hild to be a s py for the Ger m ans . 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Edy lived with a family in London.  And then when all the kids  

were evac uated fr om  London, bec aus e all the Englis h c hildr en wer e, too, s he went to live with a J ewis h 
family in Bedford.  She was  ver y unhappy ther e.  She felt they tr eated her  like a s lave.  She finis hed 
s c hool at 14 and then joined the Br itis hWomen's Arm y when s he was  old enough to do that. 
 
 
Ruth lived in London with a doctor and his wife.  At s ome point she went to a fam ily and then 
to a hos tile.  Then s he worked before s he c ame her e.  So s he s aid s he had to go live in the hos tile

Anyhow, I was  s poiled rotten.  I have to tell you.  They r eally s poiled m e.  I loved

I didn't 
r eally remember  after a while anything different.  I was  afr aid of m y fos ter  father.
  
I think that had to do 
with hearing m en with loud voic es .  I r eally was  afraid of him.
 
 
I went to s c hool.  They were a ver y deeply r eligious  Chris tian fam ily.  They belonged to a 
c hapel, not the Churc h of England.  The c hapel had a lot of c om m unity, fam ily ac tivities  which I loved.  
You know, it was  fun, s ort of like c hur c hes and s ynagogues do now wher e they really emphas ize 
c om m unity.  This plac e was  very m uc h like that.  It was  owned by a m an c alled Mr .
 
Ram s ey.  He at one 
point thr ough the as s oc iation in England look ing after the refugees was  suppos ed to be teac hing me 
Hebrew.  I am r eally bad at languages so that didn't work ver y well.
 
 
The plac e in England that kept track  of the Kindertr ans port c hildr en c hecked up on us  and 
that.  I know they onc e came
 
to my s c hool to s ee how I was doing.  I vaguely r em em ber  the head 
m as ter s taying in the r oom  with him but I only remember that happening onc e. 
 
 
After the war  my sister s all c am e to Norwic h to vis it.  They wer e very welcom ed, very muc h a

did your

did any of you hear from your  parents ? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah.  Bertle got letters.  In 1980 when there us ed to be a lot on the televis ion, 

s tarted to be a lot of information about the Holoc aus t, Bertle s aid, oh, I've got letter s.  And s he had five 
letters from my mother.

My hus band had
 
s omeone in his  offic e trans late them .  That's the only way I know anything about my 
m other . 
 
 
In thes e letter s

I m ean, it was  s ort of typic al mother stuff; telling Bertle, who was  a teenager , 
that s he was  to m ake us behave, was h behind our ears, mak e sure we did well in s c hool, we thank ed 
the people looking after us .  Ther e was  no way B er tle c ould do

At the beginning m y m other  would talk  about how
 
s he hoped to be able to join us, would s ee 
us  eventually; we would all m eet in the United States .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So hope.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Hope.  Definitely hope.  Definitely faith in God, whic h to m e is har d to appr ec iate.
 

 
And then ther e's one letter where s he's  s aying to Ber tle, "I've los t s o muc h weight."  "keep 
your  c lothes  for m e; they'll fit m e."  My father's leg did not ar rive with him .  So he did get another leg 

when he was  in the c amps .  They or dered a leg for him.

Toward the end
 
--
 
at th
e beginning the letter s had periods , punctuation.  Towar ds  the end, the 
letter s ram bled and they didn't have that.  But it was  jus t
 
--
 
ther e was  always  a faith in God, even in the 
end there was.
 
 
They were ver y nic e letters .  I als o have a letter that m y Foster  m other and my real mother 
exc hanged letters.  And that's very nic e.  So I do have that.  But my m other  s ounded like a ver y 
c om pas s ionate, c ar ing pers on.  As m uc h as
 
--
 
Ber tle is m y only s ibling left.  She talked about m y father  
being strict and m y father doing things .  She's  never  really talked about anything her m other  did.  So I 
don't know a lot.  I k now from  the letters , whic h is  very little to know about your  mother . 
 
 
I c an't im agine.  I mean, when m y kids  were 2, when m y grandkids were 2, I c ouldn't c onc eive 
of how you put them on a train.  You have to have s uc h faith that people on the other  end ar e going to 
be good people who will take c are of your kids .  I jus t c an't imagine it. 
 
 
There's a movie about the Kindertrans port "Into the Arms  of Str
anger s ."  There's s om eone in 
the m ovie who was  angry with her  par ents for s ending her  on the Kinder trans port.  I always  look  at that 

and think what love to tr y and s ave your c hild when you're not going to be

probably not going to be 
s aved.  So I find it

there are a lot of things I find hard to understand. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When did you learn about what happened to your  par ents? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin: We c am e in 1947.  I us ed to s or t of think  m aybe my parents will s how up.  But 

Bertle actually knew.  She knew in 1945.  Appar ently ther e wer e lis ts of inform ation and s he did k now 

that.
 
 
I c an't r emember how I k new.  I don't r em ember her  actually telling me but maybe s he did.  I 
don't r eally know.
 
 
There's a book  about all the J ews  that were in the Frenc h c amps .  It lis ts their  nam es, where 
they c ame fr om, how old they were and when they were deported.  So it's in there.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to take you back to the life of the Harris ons .  As you explained to us , you had 
generally what you c ons idered a happy c hildhood and that was  not the exper ienc e for  your s is ters , 
par tic ular ly one of your s ister s who felt that s he was  m ore tr eated like a s ervant there.  But tell us  a little

leather.  In their yard they gr ew vegetables.  I gues s  everybody did dur ing the war .
  
At one point they 
had c hickens .  I s ort of remember we got r id of the c h
ickens  bec aus e the rats  c ame.  Well, Allen 

does n't rem em ber it that way at all.  So I don't know what happened to the c hic kens. 
 
They were ver y 
involved in their  c hurc h, their c hapel.

I carried a gas  m ask

Bill Bens on:  And the war , of cours e, ended 70 year s  ago last week  in May
 
1945.  So the war  is over  
and yet it would be 1947 before you cam e to the United States .  Tell us what you c an about that tim e 

per iod and then how Bertle was  able to m anage to get all of you over  to the United States.  How did 
that c ome about?

Bill Bens on:  You had s aid ear lier

you made the point that one of the c onditions  for the 10,000

get people to c om e to this c ountry.  Ruth c ame in 1947, a 
week before we did.  She traveled alone.  She c ame toWas hington bec aus e we had unc les  her e.  
Then Ber tle got a notic e that ther e was  room for us .
 
 
The Har ris ons didn't have a phone.  So m y s is ter went to the polic e and had the polic e c ome 
to the Harr is ons'.  And that's how I knew.  They had to take me to London the next day, whic h was  very 
interes ting.  Now, Unc le Harr y c ouldn't tak e off work so he didn't c ome with us  but Allen and Auntie Dot 

c am e.
  
Allen was  s upposed to get a big pr ize at his  s c hool that day, whic h he, of c ours e, was n't there

Allen tells me his mother's  hair  turned gray over night.

I think  Bertle had a good tim e on the s hip.  I just was  m is er able on the s hip.  I didn't want to

another imm igrant

My unc le had a temper and

ways  of c ontrolling us , but anyhow.
 
 
I had never been to a m ovie.  The Harr is ons  didn't go to m ovies , didn't dr ink , didn't us e 
m akeup, didn't do any of thos e things .  Now, as an adult, I look back and think maybe bec aus e they 
didn't have the m oney.  It might not have been r eligion. 
 
 
I threw m y lunc h away ever y day on the way to s c hool bec aus e there was  no way I was  eating 
that s tuff.  And I went to a little elem entary s c hool
 
in Was hington.  There wer e half

Esther  Star obin:  Absolutely.  Plus  I knew everything they were learning s o it was  kind of bor ing.  I 
have a laz y eye.  I had never  wor n a patc h.  My unc le dec ided I needed a patc h.  So I was  s upposed to 

wear  a patc h, 10 years  old, ver y differ ent fr om the other kids.  I didn't wear  that either in s c hool.  So I 
was  not happy.
 
 
When I went to junior high, junior  high was  great.  We had a good teac her, a lot of activities.  I 
r eally liked junior high.  There were a c ouple of other J ewis h kids  who also c am e fr o
m  families  that

ac tually a J ewis h teac her  who us ed to invite us  for  lunc h.  She was  a mentor befor e mentor ing was

The thing that was  really unus ual about m y s is ters, Ruth when she c am e over, had lived with

We got a little money fr om Germ any.  And Ber tle s aid you all c an't have the money, that's going to pay 
for c ollege.  
 

 
Abs olutely amazing.  My par ents m aybe went to 8th grade.  It's like a lot of

Allen was  an exc hange teac her
 
to the United States .  We br ought his par ents  over.  Thes e

I'm not s ure that's the r ight wor d.  But they got on an air plane and c am e

After Auntie Dot died, Unc le Harr y us ed to s pend about s ix weeks  with us.  He loved
 
to go to

What was  really inter es ting, Allen found out a few year s  ago that his  gr andfather  was  J ewis h.  
He never  knew that.  So his  grandfather had gone to England and married his  gr andm other and he was  

a photogr apher.  And then he left and Allen and his  father and br other were ac tually in a poor house.  
But Allen's  grandfather pr obably had another fam ily bac k in the Uk raine, I think.
 
 
But anyhow, m y other daughter and her fam ily have been back to vis it 
Allen.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In England.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  He's just part of our lives  and we're part of his . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you've been over there yourself s ever al times .  But you've als o been back  to 

Adels heim .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  Tell us
 
--
 
you m entioned ear lier  that your  s ister, who had joined the Br itis h Arm y, went 
bac k  to Adels heim right after  the war.  But you've been back . What was  that like for you?  You've all 
been back.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I went back  in the 1980s becaus e I needed to k now I didn't c ome fr om a black  

hole.  I couldn't imagine what Adels heim was  like.  So Fr ed and I went bac k .  My s is ter  Bertle and 
hus band were going to com e but Mor ris  got s ick .  
 
 
So Bertle had written a letter in German
 
--
 
bec aus e 
I don't k now German
 
--
 
to them.  We got 
ther e
.
  
The whole town was  dead.  It was  around 12:00, 1:00.  No one was  s tirr ing.  But after  a while we 
found the Town Hall.  The Town Hall had moved.  So then we had to find the new one.  They did have 
the letter. 
 
So ther e was  no one who s poke English.  You go to Ber lin, everybody s peaks English 
bas ic ally but not in Adelsheim .
  
 
 
But ther e was  one
 
--
 
the 
Assistant 
Bu
rger
me
is ter's  wife, the m ayor, yeah, his  wife s poke 
Englis h.  We made ar rangem ents to go back the ne
xt day.  They said
, ﬁY
ou don't want to stay 
over night.
ﬂ
  
I s aid, 
ﬁO
h, yeah, I do want to stay here overnight.  You'r e not going to kick  m e out again.
ﬂ
  
So we s tayed s omeplac e.  We didn't know what we wer e eating.  Clear ly the towns  people knew who 
we wer e 
bec aus e they pointed to us.  But I had suc h nightmares that night.  I dreamt they wer e c om ing 
up the s tairs  to get m e and take me away.  It r eally unner ved me.  But I'm glad I did it.
 
 
So the next day we went out and there was  a m an who ac tually knew my pa
rents
; h
e c ame 
with us .  Then this woman who s poke Englis h.  So we went to the J ewis h c em eter y, whic h is  
m aintained there, actually.  Ther e were a lot of people from  m y family.  And the tom bstone all had, for 
m y family, all had the sam e symbol on them which was  r eally interes ting. 
 
 
There's a little mus eum whic h is  only open on Sundays  but they opened it for us to s ee.  We 
went to the s ynagogue.  I s aw the hous e where I was  bor n.  I s aw the cr eek  wher e 
E dy 
dr opped the 
br ead.  J ust bas ic ally s aw the plac e.  
I was  r eally  glad I had gone.  Then I had arranged to meet Debra 

12
 
 
and her to

be hus band and J udy and her hus band in
 
England.  We all went to Nor wic h and vis ited.  
Unc le Harr y s aid

on't all of you c ome again at the s am e time; it's  too many people.

> > Esther  Star obin:  I was  s o glad I went.  In 2000, by that tim e Reinhar t had taken over  for 
Mr .
 
Wettleheim  bec aus e h
e was  old.  He wr ote they wer e hav ing a c er emony to r emem ber the 
deportation of the J ews .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om Adels heim.
 
>> Esth
er Starobin:  Fr om Adels heim.  Bertle s aid we s hould go.  Renee s aid s he wanted to go
.
  
So we 
all went.  Well, Bertle and I went together.  Renee c am e.  She was  living in California.  She c ame later.
 
 
So we als o went to wher e m y mother  was  from, Rexingen and s aw the cem eter y and 
s om e of 
thos e things .  Then 
we went to Adels heim and did the tour.  Ther e was  a pr ogram.  And Bertle s tarted 
to s peak .  She had a little s peec h but s he broke down.  So Reinhart read it.  It was  all in Germ an, didn't 

unders tand.  But
 
it was  ver y m oving.  There were polic e outs ide bec aus e they wer e afraid of neo
-
Nazis .  
 
 
Right?  You don't remember?
 
>> No.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  There wer e about 100 people ther e.  Some c hildr en.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Towns people m ostly?
 
>>
 
Esther Starobin:  Towns people.  They r ead one of my m other 's letter s.  They had a dis play up that 
Reinhart had m ade of all the J ewis h families  and what had happened becaus e they had all c ontacted 

and come back .  But it was n't fanc y.  It was  Xerox c opies  of things .  He had done it hims elf s o that was  
very interes ting. 
 
 
When we c am e back , 
I 
did 
have it tr ans late
d s o 
I do know what was  s aid.  Renee took  lots of 
pic tur es.  So it was  pr etty inter es ting. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to turn to our audienc e in a minute and ask  them if they have questions  of 
you if that's ok.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I went back  one m or e time with Renee's  s ister a c ouple of year s  ago.  And s ince 

then Reinhart has an amazing c ollec tion.  He has our  family his tor y going bac k  s ever al hundr ed year s .  
He's  kept it up with us .  Stac ey had to fill in all the other  things.  
 
 
If you go this s um mer , you'll have to fill in more. 
 
 
It's  abs olutely am azing.  And I think it's s tr ange.  
He i
n m any ways  knows  mor e about m y 
fam ily than I do.  But his  son was  here as a pos t
-d
oc .  I was  fr iendly with them  and his  wife.  I s ay it was  
pr obably a little like that.  I knew m or e about their life her e than Reinhart k new.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Reinhart is  obvious ly not J ewis h.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
He's  a towns
per s on from Adels heim.  So he's taking it upon him s elf to lear n as  muc h 
as  pos s ible about what happened to the J ews  of Adels heim .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Absolutely.  In fact, we have a c ous in in Ireland that we only knew about bec aus e 

this  c ous in had c ontac ted Reinhar t and Reinhart told him about us .  My nephew was  doing his  

s em ester abr oad
 
and he's  had c ontact with Peter and his  s on.  It's a mixed up world.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You left your  mom, obvious ly, and your dad when you wer e very, very young s o you 

don't know them.  But you've told me that you feel that your  mother partic ularly has  had a s trong 
influenc e on your  fam ily.  Can you s ay a little bit about that?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes.  I think  s he has pas s ed on to us  the im portanc e of family.
  
My sis ter s and I 
were very c los e
 a
nd m y brother , when he was  alive.  My niec es  and nephews , ther e are 10 of them, 
and for  the most par t they'r e ver y c los e.  They k eep in c ontac t.  We do things together.  One is in New 
Mex ic o. We don't have as  m uc h to do
 
with him  but that's  bec aus e he's far away.  But they r eally keep 
in touc h.  Partially it's  bec aus e of s oc ial media is  a little eas ier but even before that we r eally did.  I think  

m y mother im parted to us  the im por tanc e of that, the im por tanc e of continuing life that you don't s it 
bac k  and feel s or r y for yours elf.  And we don't.  At leas t not m os t days . 
 
I think that r eally c am e fr om  m y 
m other .  And to thank  people not just expec t people to do things for  you but to be appr ec iative.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The things s he wr ote to Bertle about to remind you.
 

13
 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Really to all of us.  It got to Ber tle but yeah.  I think s o.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let us  tur n to the audienc e and see if any our audienc e member s have a question of 
you.  We have m ic r ophones  on both ais les.  If you have a question, please wait until you get the 
m ic r ophone.  Make it as  br ief as you c an.  I will repeat it s o that ever ybody  hears it inc luding Esther and 
then s he will res pond to your question.
 
 
Let's s ee if we have any body who has  a ques tion.  I always  have m any mor e if not.
 
 
We have a gentleman in the back .
 
> > Thank you for s haring.  Would you talk  to m e about how your faith has helped you c ope with what 
happened to your par ents ? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How your faith has helped you to cope with what happened to your  parents. 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I think  that's a r eally interes ting ques tion.  Bec aus e I knew nothing about J udais m  

for a long tim e.
  
When we fir st cam e to this c ountry, I went for  a ver y s hor t tim e to a s ynagogue but that 
didn'
t work out.  And I belonged, as  a kid
, 
to a J ewis h organization.
 
 
When m y kids wer e old enough to get educ ated, we joined a s ynagogue.  At the beginning I 
was n't very involved.  Ther e was  a Holoc aus t Remem branc e Comm ittee and I was  involved with that 

but eventually I got more involved.  I had an adult bar  m itzvah.  I was pr es ident of the s ynagogue.  A 
few other  things.  And I think it's helped me to be m or e philos ophic al about what happened.  I believe 
God gave us all intelligenc e and it's what we do with it and that's  what happened with m y parents .  I 

don't think anybody was  out to get my par ents  s pec ific ally to get J ews , yes .
 
 
I don't know how to s ay this .  I have no
 
--
 
I honor  m y par ents .  I r es pect them .  I have no war m 
fuzz y feelings  about them bec aus e 
I didn't k now them.  I pr obably had m ore of that kind of feeling about 
the Harr is ons  who were 
devotedly
 
Chr is tian and probably think  that I'm going to hell but maybe not.
 
 
My J udais m  is  jus t a part of m y life.  I'm pretty J ewis h, ac tually, whic h is  kind of
 
s ur pris ing 
bec aus e your formative year s  ar e when you're 2, 10, 11.  On the other  hand, I think in m any ways  
r eligion teac hes  you to be m oral.  It does n't m atter  exac tly whic h spec ies  of religion.
 
 
Am  I making s ense?  I don't know if I'm ans wering your  que
s tion.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you are, Esther.  Thank  you very muc h.
 
 
Do we have another  ques tion? 
 
 
We have a ques tion in the back.
 
> > Being from Illinois  I notic ed you went to the Univers ity of Illinois .  I was  just c ur ious  if you c ould talk  
about that
 
tim e there, if you went by your s elf and how that tr ans ition was  for you. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Say a little about your time going to the Univer s ity of Illinois .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I graduated from  high s c hool just after  my 16th bir thday.  No money as  I've s
aid.  
My s is ters  s aid you c an go to Mar yland, whic h they didn't pus h, or  you c an go live with your s is ter and 
br other
-
in
-
law and go to Illinois .  So it was  Illinois .  Illinois  is ver y m uc h a s chool wher e everybody liv es  
on c am pus  either in a s or or ity, frat er nity, or a c lub and I was  not in any of thos e.  I got a very good 

educ ation.  I was n't really par t of the life on the cam pus .  I was  more
 
--
 
my s is ter Ruth, Tam ar's mother, 
Ruth was  taking graduate c our s es  s o I helped.
 
 
I don't think  I got out of college
 
what I s ee m y kids  got out of c ollege.  In the s am e way, I didn't 
know high s c hool was  s uppos ed to be fun.  I didn't have fun in high sc hool.  Bas ic ally I got a good 
educ ation.
 
 
When I was  teac hing and they would c ome up with all of this  new s tuff, I had 
lear ned that in 
c ollege. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  Do we have another ques tion? 
 
 
You told me
 
--
 
you wer e in Ec uador I think  las t year  and you met a Holoc aus t s urvivor  there 
and that had s om e im pac t on you. 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  It was  very inter es ting.  I went to Ec uador  with som e people fr om  m y temple.  We 

went to a c er em ony there.  We wer e in this line to get our food.  There was  a m an behind me.  He 
looked at me and I looked at him  and we s aid "Holoc aus t s urvivor ." Why?  I don't know.  It was  jus t 
s om ething.  So I thought that was s o interes ting.  
 

14
 
 
 
I don't think  it defines  me that 
I™m
 
a Holoc aust s urvivor  and yet in many ways  it does .  My 
s is ter Ber tle does n't c onsider us  s ur vivor s .  I don't know what we ar e.  We los t our parents. We los t our  
hom e
.  Our whole life was  uprooted but whatever . 
 
 
We c hatted about what had happened to us, how it affec ted our lives , but jus t
 
the
 
fact that we 
jus t looked at eac h other.  I think  I look  jus t like an Amer ic an. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was he vis iting Ec uador ?
 
>> Es
ther  Star obin:  No, he lives  ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That is  wher e he had gone.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah.  I just thought that was  r eally interes ting.
 
 
The other thing that I think  is  inter es ting, Renee's  been back, I have another  gr and
-
niec e living 
in 
Germ any
; s
he's been to Adelsheim .  Her br other who is  there has been to Adels heim .  Tamar was  
ther e with her  m other .  I was  there with Renee's niec e.  Not my kids  but a lot of other
 
--
 
J udy's in
-
laws , 
m y other daughter 's  in
-
laws
, a
 
lot of us  have been back.  It's like you have to do that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All right. We have one m ore ques tion over her e.  A young lady in the back  or in the 

m iddle ther e. 
 
> >Would you s ay that talking to other Holoc aus t s urvivor s  put
 
--
 
gave you pers pective on your  own 
experienc e? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did talking to other Holoc aust s ur vivor s  give you a pers pec tive on your  own life?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Absolutely.  As  it was  mentioned at the very beginning, I've been par t of the writing 

pr oject her e.  And many of thos e people were in camps  or in hiding.  I think I've been ver y bles s ed.  I 
m ean, I was  in England during the war  but I was  s afe.  I've had people who love me.  I haven't had 
s om e of the experienc es  that m any Holoc aus t s urvivor s  have had.  That they s urvived I find 
unbel
ievable.  It was n't hard for m e to s ur vive.  People m ade s ur e I did.  So I think it did.
 
 
Now, when I was  teac hing, I taught at a s c hool that had a lot of kids  that came fr om fam ilies  
that had is s ues, as  we say.  I r elated m uc h better to thos e kids .  I c ould appr ec iate that.  I would talk  to 

them bec aus e often they were liv ing in many different families  and I c ould s ay, well, by the tim e I was  
16, I had lived in five differ ent plac es  with different people.  I c ould r elate to that.  I found it harder to 
r ela
te to people who had the kind of life wher e you'r e always  gone to s c hool with the s am e people, a 
c har med life.
 
 
But I do think k nowing other  Holoc aus t s urvivor s
 
--
 
ther e was  a c onfer enc e of Kinder tr ans port 
people, I don't k now
 
--
 
I don't rem em ber when firs t one was  but it was  s uch a
 
--
 
it was  a wonderful 
feeling to meet other people who had gone thr ough very s imilar  kind of things.  And now there's novel 

that have people who were on the Kinder tr ans port and I find that very c omfor ting.  Bec ause as a kid, 

you r ead s tor ies  and it's  nic e to read s tories  that s or t of are like your  life.  There weren't any.  But now 
ther e are.  There ar e s om e book s  about people who had very s im ilar  kinds of things.  Ther e's  one 
detective s tor y wher e her  fr iend Latte was  a Kinder transport pers on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you told m e rec ently you found out ther e had been other  Kindertr ans por t 

c hildren living near  the little town you wer e at in England and that's  only s omething you jus t lear ned of 

late.
 
>> E
sther Starobin
:  In Nor wic h
,  
whic h was  the county.  Ther e were 200 other  Kindertrans por t people.  
Now, I as s um e the Har ris ons  didn't know them  bec aus e they wer en't r eally hooked into the J ewis h 
c om m unity.  But we vis ited.  I m et a man who had lived ther e. 
 
We vis ited his  fos ter  fam ily.  I said, 
Allen, that's
 
--
 
I s ays , I don't know how to find her.  I said look in the phone book and he did.  We went 
to vis it.  A c harm ing lady.  He s inc e died but that was very nic e to do that.  He was  als o ver y c los e with 
he
r  as an adult.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to turn back  to Esther in a moment to c los e our pr ogram .  I would like to 
thank you all for being with us, r em ind you that we will have our
 
Firs t Person
 
pr ogr am eac h Wednes day 
and Thur s day into the middle of August
 
s o we hope that you will c om e bac k  and vis it us and be par t of 
the
 
First Per s on
 
pr ogr am again.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our
 
First P er son
 
gets the las t word.  So I'm going to tur n 
bac k  to Esther to c los e the pr ogr am.  Befor e I do, two c omm ents .  One, when Es ther's done, J oel, our  

15
 
 
photogr apher , will c om e up on stage and take a pic ture of Esther with you as  the back gr ound.  That 
m akes for a lovely photograph.  I'm  going to ask you at that point to pleas e s tand when Es ther is  done 
and J oel gets
 
up on the s tage.  Then when Es ther  is  finis hed that photograph, we're going to try and 
get her  up the ais le quick ly bec ause s he's going to sign c opies .  She'll be available to s ign c opies of 

"Ec hoes  of Mem or y" wher e s he has  been a member of the writing project here along with other 
s ur vivor s .
 
 
On that note, Es ther ? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  To m e, m os t of us  c an't do som ething that's going to affect hundreds and 

hundreds  of people
 
but we c an all do things  that affect one pers on or  two people and do good for 
pe
ople.  I think that has a ripple effect.  If you c an help one, two, five people and they help five people, I 

think  it's  r eally impor tant to do what you c an do to help other  people.
 

 
Thank  you.
