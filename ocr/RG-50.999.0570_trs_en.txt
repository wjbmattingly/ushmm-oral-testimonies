. 
Rae went to wor k for the Was hington, DC 
c our t s ys tem after graduating from high s c hool and attended George Was hington Univer s ity and

Rae m arried Harvey Goldfar b, a Holoc aus t s urviv or and a U.S. Ar my veteran of the Korean 
War, r ight after he left the Army

Rae s tarted a c ar eer in real es tate in 1978 and r etir ed 33 year s  later  in 2011. Rae and 
Har vey's  two c hildren, Lynn and Barr y, ar e both arc hitec ts and live in the Was hington, DC ar ea. Rae

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, thank  you s o m uc h for  joining us  today and for being willing to be our
 
Firs t 
Person
. We have s uc h a short period, an hour , and you have s o m uc h to s har e with us  s o we'll s tar t 

r ight away if that's
 
ok.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Ok .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . Before you tell us what happened to you and your fam ily during the war  and the 

Holoc aus t let's  start fir st with you telling us about your c ommunity, your fam ily, your  life in the years  
before the war  ac tually
 
began.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  I c ome from a town of inhabitants wer e between 5,000 and 6,000. About half, alm os t 
50%, wer e J ewis h. It was  a bor der town. Ther e was  a large military pr es enc e. Ther e was  a militar y 
outpos t.
 
My par ents  were both in bus ines s. My mother had a fabr ic  store and my father was  s upplying 
the m ilitar y ther e with beef and als o did exports  thr ough Germ any of gr ain and anim als. Some pigs, 

m os tly.
 
We wer e a well
-
to
-
do family. I had a pretty c omfortable c hildhood, as long as it lasted. 
 
 
My fath
er was  on a tr ip to Ger many. Never  into Germ any. Always  delivered his  goods to the 
bor der with Germ any. He found
 
--
 
it was  early 1937 and he found out that ther e was  a s egment of 
Germ an J ews  that was  hous ed in a war ehouse and went in to see what was  happen
ing. He found out, 
of c ours e, that they wer e m ade to leave Germ any. They wer e deported bac k  to Poland bec aus e they 
were or iginally from Poland. 
 
 
He got s ick, s ome s ort of an infection, that couldn't find out what it was  and, of c ours e, it was  
the pre
-
anti
biotic  age, and he died in the end of 1937.
 
My m other took  over both bus ines s es. She was  
very bus y but s he had plenty of help at home. My  father's  mother, m y grandmother  on m y father 's side, 
lived with us . She had help for m y brother  and me and for the hou
s ehold.

The Rus s ians  c ame in, in 1939
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we turn to that, 
Rae
, a couple of other questions . You los t your  father ver y 
young.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you rem em ber  m uc h about him?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  The only thing 
I r em ember is  that he was  tall. He us ed to put me on his  s houlder s  
and I c ould almost r eac h a c handelier that was  rec ently ins talled in the hous e. And it was  c old light. It 
was n't hot light. Ther e wer e no c andles  in there.
 
 
I r em ember a pictur e hanging, a por tr ait hanging, on the wall of him. That's  about all I 
r em em ber. Oh, he took  m e onc e to one of the villages at the bor der and I remem ber we overlooked the 
Rus s ian
 
--
 
their c ollective s ettlement. And I r em em ber they were playing the Rus s ian m us ic  and 
danc
ing to it. But that's about all that I r emember about him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You started s c hool at a really ear ly age. Right
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Yes . I was  put in s c hool at the age of 3. My father  was  involved in modern J ewish 
educ ation. They opened a s c hoo
l acr os s from our hous e and they needed to fill it with a c ertain num ber 
of students . I was  volunteer ed to be a student there. I was  r eading by then. I had a gover nes s who 
taught m e to r ead Hebrew. It was  a Hebr ew s c hool. So I was  a natural to go in ther e.
 
I was a little bit 
advanc ed over  the kids and enjoyed being the teacher  and, of c ourse, with m uc h pr ide.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, offic ially you wer e bor n in 1930 but, in fact, you were born in 1932. What 

ac c ounts for  the differ enc e
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  My mo
ther was
 
--
 
[Laughter] My mother was  always  thinking ahead.When the 
Germ ans c ame in, real young c hildr en wer e s epar ated from their parents and taken away fir st. Being a 
r es ourc eful wom an s he dec ided if I was  made older then I would have a better  c hanc e. I
 
would be 
ac c epted mor e. And I was  a pr etty developed c hild, I guess . [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on: With that ear ly education for a star t, too.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  That's r ight, the educ ation to star t. So I was  able to pass  for  a little older. Of c our s e, I 
don
't c are. Age is  only relative.
 
The only way I c ould s ubs tantiate it, m y aunt had a picture of me and 
ther e was  a date on it in the back .
 
When I entered s c hool her e in the United States , they ac c epted
 
the
 
fac t that I was  younger  and I c ould enroll into s c ho
ol.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, of cour s e
, 
Nazi Germ any attacked Poland September
 
1, 1939, starting the 
Sec ond Wor ld War. On Septem ber
 
17, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the eas t as part of their 
agr eem ent with the Nazis . Your  town was  oc c upied by the Rus sians. You were jus t 7 year s old.What 
c an you tell 
us  about 
that period of tim e when you wer e under the Russ ian oc c upation
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  The Rus s ians  did not look ver y favor ably on people who had m eans . There was  a 
Rus s ian expr ession that the populat
ion
 
--
 
the J ewis h population us ed. It won't mean anything to you. 
[
Speaking Non

t m eans  yours is  mine and m ine is  mine. 
 
 
My par ents
 
--
 
m y m other, had to liquidate her busines s . She distr ibuted the fabr ic  to a lot of 
farm er s, c lients  of 
her s , with the under standing that they would s upply us  with s om e food items. And if 
s he needed s omething for  c lothing. Ther e were no department stor es , you must under stand. People 

bought fabric s and m ade their own c lothing. So that was  a ver y important com
m odity to them.
 
Some of them were fr iends  bec aus e of it and s ome of them, of cours e, were the oppos ite.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  And under  the Rus s ians you wer e not permitted to pr ac tice religion anym or e. Is  that 
r ight?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  No, not quite. They looked
 
down on religion. They not appr ove of any r eligion. 
Com munism is  anti
-
r eligion. But we c ould s till prac tic e s om e of it.
 
 
Of c ours e, the Hebr ew sc hool was  c los ed. I went to a public  s c hool. I was  able to enroll in a 
public  s c hool and did r ather well. Some of the people wer e depor ted. Another fam ily was  moved into 

our  hous e to vac ate their home for s om e of the Rus s ian hierar c hy. And life was not as good. We had 
no m or e help in the house. My mother had to learn to c ook  s ome. But that was n't that muc h of a 
har ds hip.
 

4 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you wer e explaining to us , the Rus s ians  looked on your  fam ily as  bourgeois. And at 
one point you thought you might be s ent to Siber ia, and wer en't, of c our s e, but ther e was  s ome s ens e 
that you wis hed you had been, in the family. Can you s ay a little bit about that?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Well, the people
 
--
 
we wer e pac ked. You c ould only take what you carr ied s o I 
r em em ber the bundles  ready. They would c om e in the m iddle of the night. So we would be ready in 
c as e we wer e depor ted. A few fam ilies  were depor ted. And, of c our s e, they were the lucky ones . Even 

though life was  hars h but s om e of them m anaged to s urvive.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, you lived under the Rus s ian oc c upation for the better part of almost two year s . In 

J une
 
1941, Germ any 
turned on the Soviets  and attacked the Soviet Union. The Germ an Arm y entered 
your  town in the late s umm er of 1941. By the end of 1941, the Germ ans forc es  you had and the other 

J ews  of Doks zyc e into a ghetto.What do 
you 
r ecall of how life c hanged onc e the Germ ans  oc c upied 
your  town
? 
 
And then what was  it like for you to go into the ghetto?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Before even the ghetto, the J ews  wer e ins tructed to m ark their c lothing by s ewing on 

a Star of David in the c olor  of yellow. The Star of David was  a J ewis h s ymbol of pr ide. The yellow, of 
c our se, was  the tar nis hed c olor . I felt degr aded. Bec aus e walking on the s idewalk was  forbidden when 
a non
-
J ew was  approac hing. Of c ours e, if the m ilitary were approac hing, of c our s e, we had to s tep 
down.
 
 
You m ust r eali
ze it was  s till 1941. Ther e was  ver y little autom ation. Mos t of the travel was  
done by hors e and buggy. And I needn't tell you what happens  to a street when hors es  pass  by and it 
r ains . It was  r ather foul. And we had to s tep down. I remem ber the s hoes getting s oiled. And, of c our s e, 
the sm ell of it c oming home. 
 
 
That felt very degr ading.
 
But it was n't as bad as  when we wer e put into a res tricted s pac e that 
was  c alled a ghetto. The ghetto was  an area that was  fenc e off. One border  of the ghetto was  a main 

r
oad. So m os t of the houses  had gates, s o thos e gates  were c los ed off. One s ide of the ghetto was  a 
r iver  and that was  a natur al barrier, too. The r es t of it was  fenc ed off.
 
Our hous e that was  or iginally  
oc c upied by five and then four  people, we had between
 
30 and 40 that were cr owded into the house. 
 
Food was  s c arc e bec ause we c ould only 
barte
r food one day a week , m arket day.
 
 
People were taken out on as s ignm ents  to wor k. It was  a requirement to provide wor ker s to 
take c are of the m ilitar y that was  s tationed in the barr acks that wer e originally oc c upied by the Polis h 
Ar m y. Thos e people were taken out by guar d and br ought back  by guard. There was  als o a gather ing. 
Ever ybody had to c om e out to an open area and be c ounted. The Nazis  k ept c los e c ount as to how
 
m any people were in the ghetto. A few tr ied to esc ape from their  work as s ignm ents. Two or thr ee of 

them managed to es c ape. The rest of them c am e back. When the Nazis  counted them, they expec ted 

r etr ibution. They dem anded retr ibution for thos e that es c aped
. Their  way of s aying was  they were 
teac hing the J ews  a les son.
 
 
The Germ ans  organized the ghetto where they appointed a pers on to be in c harge and then a 
c om m ittee to work  with him . The Germ ans demanded s ort of a r es titution
 
--
 c
all it whatever you will
 - - t
o 
give up valuables  at fir st, then any kind of s ilver, utens ils , and eventually
 
--
 
they c alled it all for the war  
effor t
 
--
 
they asked for c opper and ir on to be turned over  to them. Bas ic ally  they r obbed the ghetto of 
any r elate that was  in ther e.
 
 
For  
the people that escaped, they r equested that 10 for  one be given to them  to s how the 
ghetto a les s on s o nobody els e would try to es c ape. Thos e in c harge offered them s elves  as  hostages . 

However, they requir ed that they give 10 young people of the s ame age as  hos tages . They took  the 
hos tages  and s hot them in front of the whole ghetto. That m eant that anybody who would try to es cape 
would be r es pons ible for 10 lives  of equal age.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You 
told m e that before long
 
the Germans began actively diminis h
ing the ghetto.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Under the dis guis e of res ettlement they c ollec ted a number of people and it bec am e 

known that they took  them  to a pit and jus t gunned them  down. The next tim e they asked for a c ount, 
s om e of the people hid. And, of c our s e,
 
whoever  they m anaged to c atch was  dis pos ed of the s am e 
way.
 

5 
 
 
We had a hiding plac e. The hous e was built in s uc h a way that ther e was  a war ehous e 
attac hed to the hous e but ther e was  a blank s pace between the walls  under the s am e roof. And that 
was  our hiding plac e. Knowing what was  c om ing up, ther e was  pr ovis ions  s tor ed ther e and when a c all 
c am e out to c ome for a count, we would hide there.
 
At that point, not too m any people c ame out. 
Whoever had hiding places  hid in their hiding places . So they started to
 
go fr om door
-
to
-
door and pull 
out people that they c ould c atc h.
 
They had many c ollaborators. People who wer e anxious  to kill the 
Jews.  
 
You m ust als o understand that r ight now in the United States  we have the big debate should 
people own guns . Guns  wer e 
s om ething that was  not ver y m uc h available in Europe. Some people had 
s om e anc ient r ifles  fr om the FirstWorld War. There wer en't too m any guns ar ound. The ability to 
es c ape was not ther e s im ply bec aus e s ome of the public  wer e belligerent als o.
 
 
I'm going 
ahead here, but we hid
 
--
 
the last c los ing of the ghetto, the las t mas s acre that 
oc c urr ed, we hid in the spac e between the walls . Not too m any people m anaged to get in. My m other , 

m y br other and I, my gr andm other, and s om e other  kids that wer e living in th
e hous e m anaged to get 
into the hiding plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I r emem ber r ight, Rae, to get into it, you had to c lim b on top of your s tove and over  

an opening
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  The baker 's oven. The hous e had a baker's oven.We had to c limb up and th
en get 
up to the attic  through an attic  opening and c lim b down
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Into the s pac e.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  There was  s om e s or t of ladder to get down into the s pace but it was n't eas y to get up 
ther e. And we s tayed in that plac e for eight days  and
 
we hear d ever ything that was  going on.
 
 
Muc h of it that I'm telling you is  m y mother's  retelling bec aus e I r emember  things  only as  
frames
, l
ike to look at pictures.
 
Fr om m y m other's  r etelling, we wer e in there for eight days . Sanitation 
was  poor . Food wasn't very plentiful. It was  water , espec ially bec am e an is s ue and a few of the people 
that wer e in there got out after eight days . And, of c our s e, they were c aught and we heard them being 
c aught. So it was  a question of how long c ould we s tay ther e.
 
We hear
d about argum ents among thos e 
who wer
e looting. Like my mother s aid s he heard neighbor s that s he c ons idered friends  arguing over  a 
pot or over a s poon.
 
 
We stayed ther e for two mor e days  and then c limbed out. My mother s ent my brother  and I 
fir s t. She c am
e out behind us  and my gr andm other behind her . Well, two kids  c am e out befor e my 
grandm other.We thought that it was  quiet bec ause all the nois e stopped. It was  nighttime. And lo and 
behold s omebody was  until the hous e
, e
ven though it was  dark.
 
My m other t
ook us into another hiding 
plac e, in a pantr y, and we c lim bed into a c ellar . My m other, my br other two c hildren, two other c hildren, 
and m y mother  was  the las t one. 
 
 
My gr andmother
, 
being slower
,  
was  behind us . She hear d the voic es  c om ing c los er. She 
quic
kly put the cover over the c ellar and s he acted c r azy s o when s he was  caught, s he s aid s he does n't 
know wher e s he is , what's  going on, and they took  her away. 
 
 
We stayed in that c ellar until the next night, c lim bed out. It was  quiet. It was  nighttime. And
 
m y 
m other  figur ed the bes t way to get out of the ghetto was  going toward the r iver.
 
We c ros s ed the river  
only to be stopped by two guar ds with rifles . Mother knew them . She begged them  to let her go. She 
s aid s he had valuables . If they would put their rifles  on their  s houlder s , put out their  hands , s he would 
fill it with whatever  they had.
 
 
One of the things  she had was  a gold watc h that my grandmother  would wear on a heavy 
c hain around her neck. Ac tually, my aunt had a pic ture of my grandm other with that partic ular  c hain and 

watc h. She wound it around his  hands to mak e sur e he does n't dr op it. Into the hands  of the other man, 
s he s ays , hold on to them , m ak e s ure you don't dr op them. Of c our s e they wer e afr aid that if s omebody 
knew about it, they would have
 
to give it up. We had enough time to es c ape.
 
 
The two c hildren that wer e with us  ran in one direc tion. She s aid "Run!"  We went towar ds  the 
hom e of a family in a village that we wer e very friendly with. My father's bes t friend. He agr eed to hide 

m y br other  and directed m y m other to take m e to his  s is ter's hous e, s he would be more than willing to 

6 
 
hide m e. However, we wer e at the s ister's hous e and s he was  feeding us  and lis tening to my mother  
Her  nephew c am e and said that m y br other , Shlomo, was  taken away by the Nazis  and his  father was  
beat up badly bec aus e he wouldn't s ay that he was  hiding a c hild. It was  his  own m other
-
in
-
law that told 
on him
, w
ho lived with him  and depended on him for 
s us tenanc e
. But s he was  willing to
 
give up a Jew 
for 10
 
kilos  of s
ug
ar.
 
 
The hous e we wer e in, the wom an gave us  s ome food and told us where to hide. She s aid the 
bes t plac e to hide would be a bathhous e
. B
ec ause there wer e no baths and s howers  in people's 
houses  in villages
, t
hey would go on Satur day to get a bath to be c lean for Sunday c hurc h. So we hid 
dur ing the day. At night again we s tar ted to run.We went thr ough fields. It took  us  a c ouple of days  to 

r eac h the hous e of the wom an who took c are of m y brother . Of c ours e s he was  s ad
 
that 
--
 
she was 
s ingle. She was  older.
 
She had no c hildr en. She was  sad to hear about my brother and offered to go 
into town and find out what his  fate was  and if he's  s till alive maybe they would give him to her s o she 

would have a s on bec aus e s he loved him.
 
She came back  and told us  that he was  s hot. So we know 
the date that he was  s hot. He was  s hot the 8th of J une in 1942. 
 
 
The ghetto didn't last long. They were s till pr ogr es s ing ver y quickly toward the Rus s ian front.
 
The pr is oners
 
--
 
the Russ ian Ar m y did not fight ver y m uc h. They laid down
 
their arm s and thought they 
would be better off as pr is oner s  of war . They wer e hungr y. They didn't have muc h will to fight. 
H
owever, the Nazis  did not treat them ver y well. They did not feed them. They took  away everything 
they had. And they m ar ched them towar d Ger many.
 
They bec ame dis illus ioned and s tarted to es cape 
en m ass e. Som e of them wer e s hot. Thos e in the front managed to es c ape.
 
 
The ar ea I c om e fr om  has  very thick pine for ests. If any of you have gone to c ut off Chr is tm as  
tr ees, you know how low the br anc hes grow and how thic k the ar ea is  with trees . They m anaged to hide 

fr om  the Nazis  and managed to organize thems elves . They bec am e what was  known as  the partisans . 

Partis an in Russ ian m eans  s om ebody devoted to his  c ountr y. So they becam e the Rus s i
an 
underground that organized in the back  of the Ger man armies .
 
Thos e J ews  that m anaged to es c ape 
tr ied to join them. Some of them wer e not very friendly but nonetheles s they needed people who lived 
in the ar ea and knew the ar ea and s o they wer e willing to
 
ac c ept them.
 
 
We, however, c ould not find a plac e to hide am ongst the non
-
J ewis h fr iends , the gentile 
fr iends , in the area. My m other  was  well
-
known and ever ybody knew who her fr iends  were.
 
We got to 
the house of a wom an who was  widowed and my father bas ic ally helped her keep her farm. She 
or iginally c ame from  Fr anc e, married a Polis h s oldier , and s ettled into Poland. However, s he was  afraid 
to hide us bec aus e s he depended ver y m uc h on the villagers  to help her k eep her farm. 
 
 
She kept us  over night.
 
The next day was  m arket day. She dr es sed me in her daughter's  
c lothes . She had a daughter and a s on. Dress ed m y mother in her c lothing. Her s on loaded the wagon 

and s he hid for  the day and we went to market
, t
o the larger c ity wher e we knew ther e was  s till a gh
etto 
c alled Glebokie.
 
With the people that went out to wor k, we managed to go into the ghetto. Of c our se, 
s he went back hom e.
 
 
Mother was  able to c ontac t through them a friend of my father's who m anaged to get a gun 
and brought it in a basket of eggs to ma
rketplac e wher e it was  ar ranged for  m other  to m eet him. They 

would allow the J ews  to barter  for food on m ark et days  bec aus e that kept the far m er s  happy. They 
were able to s ell s ome of their goods . Mother had a plan to tr y to es c ape the ghetto. She was  ver y
 
r es ourceful. She always  managed to think ahead. And, of c ours e, she was  a br ave woman. I think  m y 

m other  was  ver y brave and m anaged to live to the age of 99
 
1/2 eventually.
 
 
She tried to organize in the ghetto s om e people. She knew s he needed man power . S
he k new 
s he needed s omebody that would be a value to the partis ans . There was  a doc tor in town who was  

willing to es c ape. She knew what his fate would be
 
an
d so organized to tr y to es c ape. A tunnel was  dug 
under the fenc e. However, a few people who got wind of it, tr ied to beat us to it and they were c aught 

on the other  s ide of the tunnel.
 
 
Again, s he thought ahead. Res our c eful. We had the c lothing that we c am e into the ghetto that 
were the natural peas ant garb. So s he m ade me older, first of all. So I was  taken out to work. I had a 

7 
 
way of going out of the ghetto. I worked. And that I r emember, in a spinning m ill, trying to c atc h the 
threads that br oke and tie them  together .
 
 
On that market day, mother  had the basket with the s tr aw and the gun. She managed t
o 
bar ter  for a few eggs, put them on top.We c am e out tr ying to mingle with the peas ant that were 
r eturning back  to their villages an
d tried to find 
the partis ans .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Didn't your  m other  find a way to get s om e identific ation for you
? 
 
>> Rae G
oldfar b:  In the ghetto, in or der to not to be taken with a, in or der  to be taken to wor k , s he had 
to get identific ation for both of us. She knew s omebody
 
--
 
well, s he knew a lot of people in that ghetto 
bec aus e of bus ines s c onnec tions . In addition to selling fabric s  in her  stor e, s he also s old wholes ale. 
She would go to the large c ities , to Lodz, toWarsaw, and buy bulk  of goods , bring them back , s ell them 
to s om e of the s m aller s tor es  in the ar ea. So s he had m uc h c onnections .
 
Somebody's  daughter was  
taken
 
away. Her doc um entation was  left. That was  m y fir s t s et of doc uments  that I was  made four  years  
older  s o I c ould go out to work . Mother  got doc uments  for her s elf from  s omebody, too. So we wer e able 

to go out to work .
 
 
There was  one tim e when the Nazis  s ort of, under the guis e of r es ettlement, took  a lot of the 
J ews  out of the ghetto. We wer e at wor k .We cam e back . We found out that the ghetto was  going to be 
c los ed down for  the day. We hid. We managed not to be taken.
 
After that it bec ame im perative that w
e 
get out. So on m arket day, we got dres s ed properly, went out with the population to bar ter, went to the 
edge of the ghetto, and slipped in with the farm ers. And as  they were going back hom e, we went with 
them.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  mother  has the gun
 
with her.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Mother  has the gun in the bask et under  the straw with a few eggs  on top of it.We 
were s topped by a truck that was  c ar rying Ger mans . Mother  was  a beautiful woman. She was  asked if 

s he would like a r ide where her  village is . She
 says, 
ﬁW
here ar e you going
? 
 
I'll know if you'r e going the 
r ight way.
ﬂ  
They nam ed a village. She nam ed a village further up. So they gave us  a partial r ide in the 
bac k  of their  tr uck .
 
> > Bill Bens on: With the Germ an s oldier s ?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  With the 
Germ an s oldier s. They let us  off wher e they wer e going, and on foot we 
m anaged to go fur ther  into the ar ea, into the forest.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And found the partis ans
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We found what they c alled thems elves  a s pec ial group, a forward gr oup.
 
It was  a 
s m all gr oup that lived at the edge of the for es t, of the rec onnaiss anc e for the partis ans  who were 

deeper  in the fores t.
 
We didn't know at the tim e but the head of the gr oup was  ac tually J ewis h. The 
m en in the gr oup were not ver y keen on keepinga wom an and a c hild.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And a child.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  He s aid that they needed a c ook . And it was  natural, the group c ould then mingle 
better with the population if they had a woman as a c ook . They wouldn't have to ask  the population to 
do t
he wor k  for  them. They ac c epted us.
 
Mother was the cook for 20
-
s ome people. She didn't know 
how to c ook m uc h.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  But there wer en't many s upplies . There was  plenty of potatoes and onions. She 
knew if you 
s autéed
 
onions , they'd g
ive you a better flavor . They wer e ver y  happy. The villager s had 
learned s omething new. Potatoes with onions  and garlic . J ews  are for bidden pork . Mother  told them  

that it's best that we don't tax the population and take away their pork . She was  going to m a
ke a 
wonder ful m eal without it. And they liked it. They liked it. The population liked it bec ause they wer en't 
imposed on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you s er ved as her as s is tant.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Yes . I learned how to peel potatoes  and c arr ots  ver y well. I c ould do it to this  day.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  And my c hildren will attes t to that. I m ake wonderful potato panc akes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e in very pr imitive c onditions  ther e.
 

8 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Very pr imitive c onditions .
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  it like living ther e in the woods ?
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We were fortunate if we c ould s leep under some s ort of a roof. If the Germans  cam e 
too c los e, we had to go into the forest and s leep under  the pine tr ees . Many tim es  the c over were pine 
br anc hes  and, of cour s e, the bed pine needles. And for tunate for us  if we had no c ones  under our 
bodies . Sometim es we had to dig to dig out the cones .
 
 
Conditions  were pr imitive. And Typhus  was  very pr evalent. I was  unfortunate enough to get 
s ic k . I got Typhus . Mother was  t
r ying to get me s omeplac e. I c ouldn't stay
 
--
 
we c ouldn't s tay wher e we 
were with that gr oup becaus e ever ybody was  afraid of getting infected. She got us  loaded into a wagon 
and she knew of what they c alled a field hos pital. And the woman in c harge was  s om
eone we knew. 
She als o es c aped fr om the s am e ghetto we es c aped fr om. She was  or iginally a m id
-
wife but s he k new 
how to us e a needle and a thread to s ew up the wounds . She bas ic ally nur s ed me to health. I think  I 

attr ibute par t of m y m emory of thos e younger
 
year s  being gone bec aus e of the Typhus  fever .
 
 
We wer e not with our gr oup when the front s hifted and the Rus s ian arm ies  wer e pus hing the 
Germ ans back. They had a fr ont in the fr ont and a fr ont in the back . And that was  late
 
--
 
actually, it was  
ear ly 1944.
 
They were squeezed. And they dec ided to s end out their s oldiers  to r id of the partis ans. 
 
 
Time up?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Not quite.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on: We have a lot mor e to s har e. You got c aptur ed by the Ger mans. You wer e ac tually 
c aptur ed.
 
>> Rae
 
Goldfar b:  We wer e c aptur ed.We were captured by the Germ ans. And of all plac es , br ought to 
a war ehous e in our hometown. Mother was  afr aid of being dis c over ed bec aus e they had people from 

the nearby villages  als o. We were in further away villages . Lo and behold, they s tar ted to s eparate the 
women fr om the m en bec aus e the m en wer e the threat. The women they wer e going to s end home.
 
 
I was  just pas s ed my typhoid fever . I had no hair . My head was  s haved. I was  dr es s ed in boys  
c lothing. Needless to s ay, understanding Ger m an, [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language]. My m other  and I 
were going to be s eparated. And they dec ided that I was  a boy. Being a c hild, I s aid mec hen, one 
Germ an word, and then they dec ided that I m ight be J ewis h. Mother  jum ped out and s aid, no, s he
 
is 
not. Mother  acted ver y haughty to them . "What do you mean s he's J ewis h
? 
 
She's  my c hild. She had 
Typhus  and that's why she has  no hair, s o the Ger m ans will not get s ick  in the lic e that's in the hair that 
s pr ead the Typhus ." 
 
 
She s poke to them  only in
 
high c las s  Polis h and convinced them  that s he was  not J ewis h. 
They dec ided s he was  har boring a J ewis h c hild. She told them she was  a laundres s for the Germans  
and, of c ours e, had no plac e to leave m e bec aus e s he was  a widow and had to take me with her. A
n
d 
being a c hild I picked up s om e words . And all of a s udden they s tar ted to tes t m e. I gues s I was  s mar t 

enough not to act that I k new too muc h. They put us  under gallows . Mother told them to hang her firs t 
bec aus e s he does  not want to s ee her c hild die. And that c onvinc ed them that s he was my m other. 

They figured that anybody who would give up her life for a c hild must be the mother. So they let us  go.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And fr om  ther e would find your way bac k to the partis ans .
 

> > Rae Goldfar b:  From  ther e
 - - 
not r eally bac k  fr om ther e we s tarted to look  for  gr oups  of partis ans  
bec aus e they wer e dis per s ed. The groups dis per sed them s elves  s o they would not be able to kill 

ever ybody and als o they c ould inflic t s ome dam age to the Nazis . We managed to join with s
ome of the 
par tis ans. They were fr om  a bigger gr oup and we wer e eventually liber ated.

is the s umm er of 

1944
. T
his  would go on for alm ost another  year . Tell us what your m other then did next. I think  it's 
r em arkable.
 
>>
 
Rae Goldfar b:  My m other went back to her hom etown. Everybody goes  back  to their plac e of 
r es idenc e. You'r e s eeing things  happening here. Everybody goes  back  to their hom e bas e to s ee who 

9 
 
s ur vived. Mother  went bac k  to our hom etown to s ee if anybody s urviv
ed.
 
A neighbor  across the s treet 
gave her the pic ture that you s aw m e point to on the s c reen.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of you, your m other, and your brother. And it's the only one you have.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  That's the only one I have. She told m y m other that s he loved her and s he was s or ry 

to s ee what happened. She kept the pic ture. She pic ked it
 
out from the tras h. She s aid s he didn't loot. 
She invited m y m other  into her  hous e to s how that s he does n't have anything of our s, that was  ours. 
But s he kept the pic tur e
 
bec aus e s he lam ented fac t that s he los t a good fr iend. She gave m y m other 
the pictur e and s he told her  that if s he stays  the night, both of us , both of them, s he and m y mother 

work not s ur vive to the next day. She gave m y mother pr ovis ions  and s he s ent her back .
 
 
Mother left m e with a family that pr ovided us  with tr ans portation to the other ghetto. She c ame 
bac k  ther e and dec ided that we better go to Glebokie, whic h was  a larger  plac e to s ee if any J ews  
s ur vived. Ac tually, firs t she went by her s elf and found out J ews  s ur vived. She left m e with the villager s . 
And s he went back , found that ther e wer e J ews  who s ur vived and were liv ing all in one hous e.We 
joined with them . 
 
 
She enr olled m e in s c hool. However , the s afety net was  not to las t bec ause som e people
 
c am e, pulled out s omebody from the house and bas ic ally hac ked them to death. After  that there was  a 
watc h day and night to make s ur e that
 
we c ould s urvive.
 
 
Mother had an opportunity to enlis t in the Rus s ian Ar m y. They wer e looking for people who 
wanted to enlis t to help with the war effort. Mother enlis ted as  a wor ker  on a work tr ain to fix water  

tower s . The trains  were run on steam at that time. So s he enlis ted. We lived in a boxc ar.We had a 
c or ner of a boxc ar. There wer e other people in there that wer e
 
als o workers . We tr aveled from  r ailroad 
s tation to railr oad station.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fixing water tower s .
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Fixing water towers . We got as far  as Prus s ia where c onditions  were horr ible. The 
Pr ussians  bas ic ally mined everything and m ined them s elves  s o that they would inflic t dam age to the 
Rus s ians .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You desc r ibed to m e that the Prus s ians  would ac tually put mines and bom bs  on 

c or pses s o that if the Russ ians  want to the loot the cor ps e
 
--
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  They would mine the 
c orps es . Pr us s ia was  pr etty pr ogres s ive, like Germany. They 
m ined any kind of fixtures  that the Russ ians  may want to loot. And if they reac hed for them
 
--
 
s om e of 
them c omm itted s uic ide but they mined thems elv es . They had the guns  in their hands . And if th
e 
Rus s ians  tr ied to dis arm  them, they would blow up.
 
 
By the railroad s tation, we always  went out to get water fr om a s our c e and ther e was  a war n 
path. They were war ned to just walk with the path. A Russ ian s oldier  who was  a little inebr iated, 

happened to s tep off the path and got blown up.
 
 
At that point
 
--
 
m other's idea of enlis ting was  to reac h the American line s o that we c ould c ros s  
over  to the allied line. However, it was  impos s ible to go any further bec ause the fr ontlines  wer e very 
danger ous  to c r os s
. The ar ea where we wer e was danger ous. She found out that ther e wer e s ome 
J ews  that gather ed wher e we got the doc uments . Our boxc ar attac hed to a tr ain that was  going in that 
dir ec tion. And we ended up in the c ity of Lubin whic h was  s ort of fur ther , souther n part of Poland. We 
s tayed there for a number of tim e. That's where the Red Cr oss  c am e in to help with food, s om e 
c lothing, and, of c ours e, the idea for us was  to tr y to get into the Am er ic an zone, for one thing, and to 
tr y to get c loser to what was  then c alled Pales tine that is  now Is r ael bec ause that's the only place that 
would ac c ept us.
 
 
Going to the United States  was  a diffic ult pr oject. We eventually wer e able to c ontac t my 
father's s is ter  and her hus band. Mother  rem em ber ed the addres s fr om wr iting
 
to them exc ept for s he 
did not r em ember  DC. And the letters went to the s tate ofWashington. And they never got them.
 
However, m y m other adver tis ed in a J ewis h paper and m y unc le s aw that we s ur vived and got in touc h 

with us . By then we had m anaged to get
 
to Italy. We c am e to Italy and found out that the day before, 
the war there had ended. So we s tayed in Italy for two and a half year s before we managed to get to 
the United States .

> > Bill B ens on:  Tell us, while
 
--
 
onc e you got to Italy, you s till had hoped to get to Pales tine. You were 
uns uc c es sful. I think you tr ied to
 
--
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  We tried s ever al tim es . One time a truck  broke down that was  taking us  s outh. At 
that tim e we wer e in Modena, nor ther n Italy. Eventually the Dis plac ed Persons  Camps wer e organized 
in Italy, whic h wer e in the s outh, whic h s uited us  ver y well bec aus e that was  clos er to the 
Mediter ranean. It was  right on the edge of the Mediterr anean. However , my m other developed as thma. 

And of all the tim es, when we wer e about to be taken to a s hip, s he had an as thma attack and was  
taken to the hos pital. That partic ular group ended up in Cyprus .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They wer e inter ned in Cypr us by the Britis h.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Right. So s omehow we es c aped that. At that point we had been c ont acted by my 
unc le and aunt and they s tarted the proc es s of getting us to the United States .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You arr ived here in 1947. Finally  you wer e able to m ake it her e. Tell us what it was  like 
for you to c om e
 
--
 
to go through one m or e major adjus tmen
t, upheaval. What was  it like to get her e
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  It was  a dual experienc e. I learned a few wor ds  of Englis h, taught in an Italian 

s c hool. I learned m or e Italian than Englis h. And, of c ours e, nobody c ould under s tand a word I was  
s aying. However, I realiz ed the s imilarities  of s ome of the words .
 
 
When I firs t c am e in, it was  a c om pletely differ ent world. Even though Italy was
 
pr ogres s ive 
and
 
--
 
it was  
mec hanization and s o forth but we cam e in at night and the only thing I c ould s ee look ing 
out to
wards  land was  lights  going forth and back , white lights going one dir ec tion, r ed lights  going the 
other direc tion. I ask ed one of the s ailor s  who s poke s om e Germ an and s om e Italian. We c ame over  on 
a troop s hip, bas ic ally s lept in bunk s  and the s hip alm ost went down one day out of New York. But 
fortunately the s torm s eized and abled to r ight itself. He told m e that thos e ar e c ar s going acros s 
br idges. Never s aw s o many c ar s .
 
 
Of c ours e, the next m or ning when it all c leared up, we s aw the tall buildings  of 
New Yor k , the 
Statue of Liberty. I didn't know what it was , fr ankly. I s aw a statue in the water and I was  told it's the 

Statue of Liberty.
 
Howev er, I was  ver y m uc h impres s ed with all the tall buildings . It was  only when I was  
in high s c hool that s om e of t
he students and I went to Ellis  Is land and was  able to c limb up in the 
Statue of Liberty.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rae, you wer e 15, in fact, when you arr ived but offic ially everybody thought you wer e 
17.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And they put you in elementar y school.
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  I had no papers. And I c ouldn't go anywher e to be ac c epted unles s I had paper s. My 
unc le put me in a private J ewis h s c hool, Hebrew s c hool. I s poke Hebrew. I lear ned it as  a c hild. To this  
day I c an s till s peak  it better  than I c an Polis h or Rus s ian. Becaus e som ehow it s tuck with m e because 
it was  a language that I've learned m uc h, m uc h younger and had no res entm ent against. Polis h and 
Rus s ian I had m uc h r es entm ent against. I under stand s om e of it. And here in the mus eum when I meet 
s om e people that speak  Rus s ian or  Polis h, I c an under s tand s om e of it, not all of it. I haven't s pok en it 

in 70 years . But I've nev er  developed this  love for  it. And als o, it has no connec tion. Slavic  languages 
have no c onnec tion with Englis
h.
 
 
So I was  put in elementar y s c hool in a private s c hool. The kids s poke Hebrew and Englis h. I 
c ould c ommunic ate in Hebr ew. And I picked up enough Englis h.
 
 
Als o, my unc le had a gr oc ery s tore. As  s oon as I c am e back from  s c hool, I would go down to 
the

And, of c ours e, I knew all the nam es of the differ ent s oft

had enough knowledge to enter. I was  given of a tes t and told that I qualify. She c ame in every m orning 
for half
-
hour to 45 minutes  ear lier and taught m e s entenc e s truc ture.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the little tim e we have left, whic h is  ver y little, I want to as k  you a c ouple m or e 

questions .
 
 
You told us not only how br ave your  m other  was , fr om  ever ything you told us, s he was  c lear ly 
a remarkable hum an being
, j
us t as res ourc eful as anybody c ould ever pos s ibly be. What was  her life 
like when s he c am e
 
to the United States
? 
 
> > Rae Goldfar b:  Mother  had a 
v
er y diffic ult tim e adjus ting. She was  us ed to being in c harge, being a 
bus ines s wom an, having her  own bus ines s . We were needles s to s ay penniles s . She didn't k now the 
language. It was har d for her to adjust. She did not want to live on c harity, bas ic ally
,  
from my aunts  and 
unc le. Ther e was  m ore ability for her to get s om e sort of wor k  in New York s o s he m oved to New York. 
And needles s  to say, s he got a job in a fac tory. The only thing s he c ould do was  run a s ewing m achine 
on a straight line. She didn't know any other way. She got a job that paid
 
$20 a week . Our rent was
 
$60 
a month. T
her e was  very  little to go with.
 
 
My father had s ome r elatives  in New Yor k . They wer e helpful in s ome way. One of them had
 
a 
butc her s hop. Made s ure m y mother had s om e meats  on the table.
 
 
When I finis hed junior high and was  about to enroll into high s c hool, I went to live in New Yor k 
with her. I got a job, s o I was  helping with hous ehold expens es  and I was  fortunate again, in New York, 
to have a guidanc e c ouns elor  who es c aped Germany in 1934, I think  it was , who under stood what I 
went through and r eally helped m e along.
 
 
Als o, ther e wer e two Englis h teac hers who were willing to help with language. One helped me 
with 
eloc ution
 
and one speec h. They put m e in front of a mirr or. I was r olling m y R's. I c ouldn't 
pr onounc e the TH. I had to tr y my darnedes t if it took  three hours it took thr ee hours . I rem em ber it ver y 
well. I still slip onc e in a while. I think I'm ok  now.
 
> > Bill B

And then Rae will s tay behind for a while up her e. So any of you who want to c ome up and ask  her a

> > Rae Gold
far b:  I like to tell about my exper ienc es  bec aus e that's the only memorial to an extended 
family. My m other was  one of eight. My father was  one of thr ee. Ther e is  nothing left of them. Ther e is  

nothing to r emember them with other than the fact that I s peak  to you and tell you about it.
 
 
My own experienc e has  taught m e that prejudic e is  wr ong, es pec ially when aided and abetted 
by one's  own town's  people and neighbor s out of jealous y and gr eed.
 
 
This  is wher e we have an exhibit that you c an s ee her e, tempor a
r ily he
r e, on this  level c alled 
"S ome Wer e N
eighbor s" about intim idation by the public . I urge you if you have the time to pleas e vis it 
that exhibit and, of c ourse, the main exhibit about Nazi pr opaganda and artifac ts  that are by ticket 
access, bypass acce
s s, on the fourth level.
 
 
I thank you all for  c oming.
