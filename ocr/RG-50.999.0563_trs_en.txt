Albert Gar ih taken in 1945
. 
                                  
Alber t's parents , Benjamin and Claire Gar ih, were born in Constantinople, Turk ey, but m oved to Par is  in 
the 1920's . Alber t and his  twin brother , who died in infanc y, wer e bor n J une
 
24, 1938, in Paris, joining 
older  s iblings  J acqueline and Gilber te.We s ee all three s iblings, inc luding Albert with long hair , in this  
1943 photograph. Alber t's  father wor ked in a garm ent factor y, and the family lived in the janitor's  
apar tm ent ther e.
 
 
In May
 
1940, Germ any invaded France and oc c upied Par is , identified by the arrow on this 
m ap. The Garih family fled s outh but they s oon retur ned to Paris  wher e they were s ubjec ted to

on. In 1943, Alber t's  father was  deported to a for c ed labor c amp and 
Alber t's mother and the childr en went into hiding with Madame 
Galops  
and her husband for the next s ix 
m onths.When they r eturned hom e in 1944, police were s ent to arr es t the Gar ihs but agreed to s ay 
ins tead that the family was  not hom e if the fam ily would leave imm ediately .

Alber t was  placed in a Catholic  boar ding sc hool for boys and his s is ter s  in one for gir ls  in a 
nor theastern s uburb of Par is .When Par is  was  liberated in Augus t
 
1944, Albert's mother was  able to 
br ing her c hildren back  to the c ity. Clair e and her c hildr en ar e s hown together in this  photogr aph. 
Alber t's father, releas ed fr om labor cam p, walked fr om  Belgium to Par is , r etur ning to his fam ily in 
Septem ber
 
1944, on Rosh Has hanah, the J ewis h new year.
 
          
 
The Garih family r em ained in Fr anc e after  the war. Alber t r ec eived his  Bacc alaureate degr ee 
in 1957; then earned a degr ee in Englis h and Spanis h to Frenc h tr ans lation from the Sc hool of 

Advanc ed Trans lation and Inter pr etation studies  at the Sorbonne in 1962 and im m ediately began his  
c ar eer in trans lation, whic h he c ontinues  to this  day, 54 years  later . His  early work was  tr ans lation of 
s c ientific  and tec hnic al doc um ents  and public ations  and later  trans lation of politic al
 
and ec onomic 
doc um ents .
 
          
 
Alber t's wor k  took  him from  Fr anc e to Cameroon in Afr ic a, to Montreal and then eventually to 
the United States
. 
The organizations  for whic h he wor ked inc luded, among others, the International 
Civ il Aviation Organization,
 
the Inter
-
Americ an Developm ent Bank, the Wor ld Bank and the United 
Nations . His  work with the Wor ld Bank brought him  toWas hington, D.C. in 1976. His  c urr ent c ons ulting 
work is  for the United Nations .
 
          
 
In 1967, Albert m arr ied Marc elle Ohayon who
 
had m oved to Fr anc e fr om Mor oc c o in 1960
. 
Alber t and Mar c elle have three daughters, J udith, Dalia and Noém i. Their thr ee daughter s have giv en 

them eleven grandc hildren, ages 21 year s to 15 m onths.
 
         
 
Alber t des cr ibes  him s elf as  a r eal movie buff, enjoys  photogr aphy and loves  to read, and he 
loves  to tr avel. Alber t and Mar c elle went to China in 2012 and vis ited South Afric a in 2014. Last year , 
Alber t tr aveled to Franc e, a very s ignific ant trip for him that we will likely hear more about today. This  
pas t Febr uary, he tr aveled to India wher e he s pent almos t three weeks tour ing the c ountr y. Albert 

s peak s  Frenc h, Englis h, Spanis h and J udeo

Alber t volunteers her e at the Mus eum , s peaking very often to c lasses of students  fr om all over 
the c ountry, s ometim es by telec onfer ence, in whic h he tells  his  story. And he s its at the Donor s Des k  
wher e visitors  c an talk  to him .
 
          
 
With that, I would like you to join m e in welc oming our Firs t Pers on, Alber t Gar ih.

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, welc ome and thank  you s o muc h for agr eeing to be our Fir s t Per s on today. We 
have jus t a r elatively s hor t per iod, an hour , and a lot for  you to s har e s o we'll s tart right away.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Sure.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wor ld War II began in Septem ber
 
1939 
when Nazi Germ any invaded Poland. The 
following May, May
 
1940, Germ any invaded France. You were nearly 2 year s  old at the tim e. Before we 
turn to the war years  and what 
it 
m eant for  you and your  family, tell us  what you c an about your family 
and their life
 
before Germany invaded Fr anc e, befor e the war began for you.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yeah. My parents , as  you s aid before, wer e bor n in Cons tantinople, Istanbul. They 

were J ewis h, of c ours e. Ther e was  a J ewis h c ommunity ther e. Life was  fairly good but they were
 
a 
m inority. 
 
 
Turk ey was  par t of the Ottoman Em pir e, s panned most of the Middle Eas t, what is  today 
Lebanon, Syr ia, J or dan, and even Nor th Afr ic a. But the Ottoman Em pire, the idea during the Firs t World 
War to s ide with the Germ ans  and wer e in the war defeated in 1918. In 1919, there was a c onferenc e in 
Versailles  wher e the Ottom an Em pir e was  dis m antled. And when the Ottom an Em pir e was  dis m antled, 
the only thing that c ould be s alvaged was  Turkey its elf.
 
  
And then c am e a str ongm an nam ed by Mus tafa Kamal Ataturk , whic h m eans  the father of 
m odern Turkey, and its Jews  didn't feel quite c omfortable. It was  a nationalized m ovement. The other 
s ide of a national movement is  often xenophobia. So they wer e afraid.
 
 
The Gr eeks who wer e liv ing in Turkey
,  
Mus tafa Kam al
 
Ataturk  c am e to power  in Turk ey, they 
fled. They were living in a port c ity on the As ian sea. Ther e was  a very s trong Greek c ommunity. And 
they fled.
 
So the J ews  thought m aybe they wer e next and don't k now about that. So a lot o
f J ews  at 

3 
 
that tim e dec ided
 
to em igrate. Mus tafa Kam al Ataturk  c ame to Poland in 1923. My par ents  emigrated to 
P ar is .
 
 
My Par is  had been educated in Turkey, in a s c hool in Vers ailles  whic h was  a big organization, 
international organization, Fr enc h, mos tly Fr enc h, but opened s c hools  
all over  the Ottoman Empire 
wher e educ ation was  given in Fr enc h. So when my parents  dec ided to emigrate, Franc e was  a natur al 
des tination. It was  m uc h easier to go to Fr anc e than any other c ountry. Although m y m other  s pok e a 

little bit of Germ an als o but they wer e not inter ested in going to Germany.
 
 
Any way, they ended up in Fr ance. They both em igrated in 1923 but they didn't know eac h 
other. They met in Paris . And they marr ied. They met in 1927. They mar ried in 1928. And my s is ter, 

J ac queline, was  bor n in 1930. My s is ter Gilberte in 1933. And I was  bor n with m y twin br other in 1938.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, you des c ribed to me your  father  as smart but a s elf
-
educ ated m an. Say a little 
about him.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  My father
 
--
 
m y parents were c om ing fr om ver y poor  fam ilies . My m other was  one of 
s even s iblings  and m y grandfather, my maternal gr andfather, died when my mother was  11. So it's  my 

grandm other who rais ed their  seven c hildr en by hers elf. And that was  not eas y. And m y father  was  
about the s am e
 
--
 
m y g
randfather  was  a m ilk man, s elling milk. He was  not making ends  meet s o my 
father ver y s oon started wor king.
 
He managed to go to s c hool to get an educ ation. His Frenc h was  
good. His  Fr ench was  perfect. They had an ac c ent. It was  not like the Polis h ac c ent. It was different. 

And it was  very nic e, actually. But the Fr enc h was  abs olutely perfec t.
 
 
My m other, as s oon as  she c am e to Fr anc e, s he was  able to get a job as  a s ec r etar y in a 
s m all c om pany, ac tually. Ther e's  an anec dote about that. At one point s he had to write a letter. It was  
to the m an who built all of thes e wide avenues  and all of that. And the s pelling of the name which was  a 
Germ an nam e was  Haus s mann. And m y m other, the only Haus s mann s he ever  hear d of was  a c ertain 

Œ O- s-m - a- n
. And her  c olleagues  m ade fun of her. And s he was  offended by the bos s who s aid when 
you s peak  a for eign language the way s he s peak s  Fr enc h, you c an't m ake fun of her.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  And your  mom, by the standar ds of the tim e, s he was well educ ated.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  She was. She got what they called at that time an equivalenc e to the bacc alaureate. 

Yeah, m y m other was  more educ ated than my father .
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  So when your  parents  moved independently, met and mar ried in Par is , they c ame from 
Turk ey. They s poke fluent Frenc h. But what was  their  c itizens hip s tatus ? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  As  s oon as  they em igr ated from Turkey they los t their Turkis h c iti
zens hip and they 
were s tateles s. In the 
`
30s
 
--
 
they emigrated in 1923. In the 
`
30s  they s tarted the proc es s of bec om ing 
naturalized with Frenc h citizens hip. But at one point, for whatever reas on, the Frenc h author ities  froze 
all the applic ations  and m y pa
rents  r em ained s tateles s  thr oughout the war . It's only 1948 that they got 
their pass port.
 
 
The first thing my father did, bec aus e he was  always  nos talgic
 
--
 
they s uffer ed a little 
bit
 
--
 
m or e than a little bit
 
--
 
about anti
-
Semitism even before the war. There was  a lot of anti
-
S em itis m  
in Fr anc e. And m y father and mother  exper ienc ed that in Turkey. In Turkey, whic h was  a Mus lim  
c ountr y, everybody was , you know
 
--
 
they wer e also s ec ond
-
c las s  c itizens . There were s om e s pec ial 
r egulations  and s om e res tr ic tions
 
about them. But the population was  not tr eating them infer ior  or  
anything like that.
 
 
In Franc e, m y father  was a very pr oud m an. He r es ented the way that he was  tr eated, like les s 
than nothing, by s ome Frenc h people.
 
 
So they were s tateles s . That means  th
at had s om e c ons equenc es  dur ing the war .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It m eans es s entially you have no c ountry, s tateles s .
 
> > Albert Garih:  Stateles s , they were s tateles s . They were living in Fr ance, almos t like refugees , if you 
want. But they were not refugees . They
 
had em igrated. They were legal immigr ants but they had no 
Fr ench c itizens hip. They los t their  Turkis h citizens hip.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ger many invaded Fr anc e in May
 
1940. The war  had begun in Septem ber
 
1939 but 
they invaded Fr anc e in May
 
1940. As  the Germans
 
advanc ed on Par is , ther e was  a m as s exodus  of 
people fleeing Par is . Es tim ates ar e as high as 80% of the population left Par is . And you s aid to me that 

4 
 
for your fam ily
 
--
 
and this is  a quote
 
--
 
it all began with the exodus  from Paris . Tell us  what that m ea
nt 
about your  family.
 
> > Albert Garih:  When Par is  was invaded in J une
 
1940, ac tually there was  a battle c alled the Battle of 
Fr ance wher e the French Arm y was  defeated and most of the s oldiers  wer e taken pris oner, actually. 
The Germ an s oldier s m arc hed down
 
Champs Ely s ees .We have videos  that s how that, s om e c lips . So 
it's  not only the Jews  but the whole population of Paris  fled s outh. It was  total c haos on the streets with 
c ar s , bic yc les, s om e people on foot.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Hundreds  of thous ands  of people
 
fleeing.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Yes . I don't know how many but there were a lot of people. And ther e wer e als o the 
attack s  of Germ an and Italian Air Forc e. They wer e s tr afing them  and bombing. That's  the fir st tragedy 
that befell m y family. My grandmother, uncle, an aunt, and two c ous ins  were killed, either str afing or 

bom b
ing
, I don't know exac tly
,  
that fell on their  c ar north of Lyon, a c ity near the Loir e River . They wer e 
killed. That was  the firs t tr agedy that struck  our family.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was that yo
ur  m other's  m other, maternal grandm other ?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes , my mother's m other. So I have no r ec ollec tion of her . I was  2 years  old, exac tly, 

dur ing the exodus . I was  2 year s  old. My m other told me that at one point we s topped on the Loir e 
River in on
e of the
 
--
 
you know, the Loire River  is  famous for  its  beautiful chateau, jewels , really, crown 
jewels .
 
We fled to one of the c hateaus . But it was  nothing luxur ious.We were s leeping on the floor. I 
was  2 year s  old. My m other had nothing to feed me. And I
 
was  c rying.
 
 
My m other told m e at one point
 
--
 
all that I am telling you now about this  tim e is what my 
m other  told m e. From  1942 onwards  what I'm going to tell you is  m y own r ec ollec tion. But from 1940 

until 1942 is  what m y m other told me.
 
My m other told
 
m e at one point I was crying s o m uc h and I was  
dis r upting ever yone who was  tr ying to s leep; that ther e was  a s oldier am ong the c rowd who had 
m anaged not to be taken pr is oner who had a bottle of Sc hnapps  and he gave m y m other  Sc hnapps  
and s aid "Give him s om e Sc hnapps . That will c alm him down." And apparently it worked.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you found refuge in the villa. Was your father  with you
? 
Do you know?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  My father  stayed behind. My father , for  whatever  reas on I don't know, I wanted to 
keep his  job. I don't k now exac tly for  what r eas on. I know that I was  with m y m other and m y s is ters  
dur ing that per iod.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would end up returning after a while, returning to Par is .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  After a few days , I couldn't tell you whether it was  a few days , a few weeks, but after 
s om e time
 
--
 
we had nowhere els e to go, you know
? 
How long c ould we s tay as  r efugees in that 
c hateau? 
I don't know.
 
 
We went back  hom e. We had nobody to res pond to over s eas . We had no relatives  in the 
s tates, Canada, or anywhere els e, and we didn't have any money. So there was  no way we c ould really 
go anywher e. So the only plac e for us  was  to go bac k  hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Whic h was  an occ upied c ity by the Ger mans .
  
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes . 
In J une
 
1940, when the Battle of Fr anc e
 
--
 
when the Fr enc h Ar my was  defeated 
in the Battle of Fr anc e, the Fr enc h gover nm ent res igned and a new gover nm ent was  form ed whic h was  
a collabor ationis t gover nm ent whic h m eant under Petain
 
--
 
the fir st hero of the w
ar . We'r e going to 
c elebr ate the 100th anniver s ar y of the First World War. And he was  the her o of that war , of that battle. 

He was  known as  a hero. But in 1940 he bec ame s enile, was  in his  80s . He c ouldn't c ope. And he 
turned towar ds  the German and was  r eady to c ollabor ate. He appointed a prim e m inis ter, Pierr e L
aval
, 
who was  an anti
-
Sem itism  and c ollabor ationis t, who went beyond the c all of duty to help the Germans . 
At the extent of the J ews , of c our s e.
 
 
There was  a statute 
of the 
J ews  at that tim e that wa
s  patterned on the Nur em berg Laws , 
whic h were adopted in Ger many. Almos t every day there was  a new law. Lawyers  were debarr ed. 

Doc tors were not allowed to practic e m edic ine. Teac her s  were kicked out of public  s c hools. And there 
were all s orts of r estrictions .We were not allowed in public  trans portation, for ins tanc e. So ther e wer e 

all s orts of restr ictions .
 

5 
 
 
We wer e leaving. My father  was  an ac c ountant. He had lear ned ac c ounting by hims elf and he 
bec ame an ac c ountant. He was  doing the pay
 
--
 
he was  wor king
 
for a garment factor y in a s uburb of 
Paris  where we lived. The owner of the c ompany was  a J ew als o. And he had allowed m y father and 
our  fam ily to live in the janitor 's apartm ent of the fac tory. So that we c ould s ave on the r ent, I gues s. So 
m y father was
 
juggling two jobs . He was  working full
-
tim e during the day in that fac tor y, doing the pay 
of the employees , and at night he would go to a movie theater  in an area in Par is , taking tickets at the 
entr ance, like you have in today's  c inemas. He was  doing that to m ake s ome extra m oney for us. We 
were not living in luxur y, far from it. So we wer e living in that janitor's apartment.
 
 
And in 1942, bas ed on the s tatute of the J ews , the factor y, sinc e the owner  was  J ewis h, the 
fac tor y was  c onfis c ated. The owner had
 
to flee. He went away but he c ame back, actually. He s ur vived. 
But he went away. The fac tor y was  given to an Aryan manager, a non
-
J ewis h m anager. And one of the 
c ons equenc es  is that we had to vac ate the apartment, the janitor 's apartm ent. 
 
 
That was  in J u
ly
 
1942. And fr om then on I rem ember ever ything. And what I'm going to tell 
you now is  bas ed on m y own exper ienc e and my r ec ollec tion of thes e fac ts .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In fact, Alber t, what you s aid to me was  that the Nazis  really turned the s c rews  on the 
J
ews  in 1942. That's when things  r eally bec ame infinitely wors e.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yeah. Ac tually, the Fr enc h had not waited for  the Germans  to tur n the s c r ew. They 

s tarted rounding up people in 1941 and s ending them fir st to a tr ans it c amp in a s uburb nort
h of Paris . 
And fr om ther e they would be s ent direc tly to Ausc hwitz.
 
 
At that point we had to vacant our apar tment and find an apartment. There was  a big hous ing 
c r is is . It was  not eas y to find a plac e. So we found s omething that was  r eally minimal, with two r oom s , 
not two bedroom s, two rooms , a tiny kitc hen, toilet, no bath
room . So that was  our apartment. Only  
m inim al c omfort. It 
had 
running water but not hot water. So r eally bas ic . Things  that we take today for 
granted was  a luxury in thos e days .
 
 
So we moved to that apar tm ent. I remember that vividly. I r em em ber . I was  4 y
ear s old. I 
r em em ber I was  impres sed by the wall paper s  on the wall. Things like that, you know, when you'r e 4 
year s  old, jus t a few things like that stay with you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e about an inc ident. I think it m ay have happened when you moved
 
into that 
s m all apartm ent but I'm not s ure, involving when your  m other  handed you over  a r ailing to s om ebody to 

hold you. Will you s har e that with us ? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  That was  later, actually, yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  You have an exhibit on this  floor called 
S ome Were N
eighbors : Collabor ation and 
C
om plic it in the Holoc aus t. When I s aw that title, I thought it c ould not apply in a better  way to my 
family. We wer e 
s andwiched between two families : one, a c ouple of Comm unis t people wer e f
ighting 
the r egime, s ent to mandator y Labor Servic e in Ger many and had not reported for duty
; o
n the other 
s ide were

a collabor ator  who was  found dead in a m ovie theater  after the war in r etaliation. He had 
been gunned down by s ome people in retr ibution
 
for  his s er vic e to the Germ ans dur ing the war.

did they know that we wer e J ewis h
? 
I don't 
think  s o. My s is ters  think  that they might have known. They were friendly with us . At one point we wer e 
s har ing a balc ony. Ther e was  jus t a small railing between our  part of the balc ony and their part. And the 
lady invited m e over. So m y m other pas s ed m e over  the r ailing to the lady. She invited me into her 
apar tm ent. She gave me s omething that I had never s een before and I still r em em ber to this  day, a 

yellow tom ato.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Albert Garih:  Ever ything was  a luxur y item in thos e days . An egg was  a luxur y item. So a tom ato, 
and a 
y
ellow
 
tomato
? 
I had never s een that. T
hat was  wonder ful.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The r ounding up of J ews and their  deportation to Aus c hwitz really intens ified in the 
s um m er  of 1942. In the fall of 1942, your par ents sent you to a hom e in the s ubur bs. Tell us about tha
t.

> > Albert Garih:  It was  in 1942, that's r ight. Well, you know, they had started to round up J ews  and 
s end them to c am ps . We didn't know about the c am ps . We didn't know about the gas c ham bers, about 
the cr em ator y and all of that. But we knew that people
 
were s ent east. It was  not for the good. So we 
were ter r ified. And m y parents wer e very c onc er ned that that might happen to us , s o they dec ided to 

s end us , my s is ter and I, to a farm outs ide of Par is in a plac e whic h is  today fam ous  for the park. In 
thos e
 
days  it was  a farmland.
 
 
We s pent the winter  of 1942
-
1943 ther e. I remember that winter  was  ver y c old. There was  a 
lot of s now. It's  funny bec aus e I have few details  that s tay. And I remem ber that's  the plac e where I 

hear d for the first tim e the s ong "O Tannenbaum ." That br ings me back  to that plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause that's wher e you hear d it.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  That's wher e I heard it. Yes.We s ung it in Fr enc h. It was  [Speaking Non

E nglis h 
Langua
ge]. It was  the s am e 
s ong.
 
 
My s is ters  would go to sc hool. I was s taying
 
--
 
ther e was  two ladies . The men probably had 
been taken pr is oner  with the Fr enc h Arm y. I don't know. I never s aw any m en in that farm.
 
So we wer e 
s taying with the ladies . Thes e ladies  wer e r ais ing pigs  and rabbits . I rem em ber that. An
d I was  

fasc inated by the rabbits. I was  playing with the r abbits  all the tim e. They wer e in smaller  boxes  there.
 
 
I was  very friendly with the ladies . They were fr iendly with me. One day in c onvers ation
 
--
 
m y 
par ents had not told the ladies  that we were J
ewish. They s aid jus t that they didn't have enough to feed 
us  and we would be better fed in a far m. And the ladies  bought that. They took that at fac e value.
 
So 
one day in the c onver s ation I told the ladies  that we were Jewis h. They panic ked. And they s ent
 
us rig
ht 
bac k  to our parents. That was  in the s pr ing of 1943.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you're back in that apar tm ent with your par ents .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes , with the c onstant danger of r oundups .
 

 
In J uly
 
1942, exactly when we moved into that tiny apar tm ent, that's  when the bigges t r oundup 
of all took  plac e. They were r ounded up, 13,000 people, inc luding 4,000 children. Everybody was  

parked on a sm all stadium  where ther e wer e bic y c le r ac es on a tr ack .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Velodrom e.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes , V il™
 
d™Hiv. 
People were in ter rible c onditions . It was  J uly
 
1942, s umm er. It was  
hot. The people had been told to br ing a m inim um  of per s onal effects with them . So they didn't have 
any food. They didn't have any water. It was  hot. They wer e thirsty. The children were running 
ever y wher e.
 
After  a few days  in that c ondition eventually they wer e s ent to tr ans it c amps and fr om the 
tr ans it c amps  they wer e s ent to Ausc hwitz. And out of the 13,000, ther e wer e 4,000 c hildr en. And none 

of them c am e back  fr om Aus c hwitz. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert in Septem ber
 
1943, your father was  taken for forc ed labor to the Channel 
Is lands  between England and Franc e. Soon after, your mother , your  s isters, and you went into hiding. 

Tell us what you c an about your father being for c ed to go to the Channel Is lands  and then about your  
m other  finding a plac e for  the family, the res t of the family to hide.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Well, my m other, abs olutely amazing. She was  des per ate. She was  s o afraid that we 
m ight be tak en away. And that was  a r eal danger, ac tually.
 
My m other was  a ver y s mall lady, 5
-
foot tall 
about but s he s howed s o much im agination, s o muc h res ourc efulnes s. She was  des per ate. She was  

fighting like a lion pr otecting her  c ubs
, l
iterally.
 
 
My father was  tak en away. He was  sent to the Channel Is lands . They wer e building what was  
c alled the Atlantic  Wall that was  s uppos ed to s top the invas ion of the 
a
llies  into Fr anc e. Bec aus e the 
Germ ans expec ted the allies  to land s omewher e in Franc e and from ther e to pus h towar ds  Ger many. 

So my father 
was  in one of thes e is lands. Ther e were s ome c am ps ther e. There wer e about 900 
inm ates in his  c amp. And they were building bunker s . Thes e pillboxes fr om whic h the Ger m ans wer e 
s hooting at the allies  when they landed on the beac hes , als o. So that was  the id
ea.
 
 
My father at that point was  wor king on a s m all s caffolding. There was  a loos e bolt. He stepped 
on the board. The bolt hit him. And he fell down a c liff. He was  los ing his blood. He was  picked up by 
the s oup tr uck . And eventually
 
--
 
he s urvived. My father was  ver y s tr ong. I would not have s urvived half 
of what he went thr ough but he was  very s trong and he s ur vived.
 

7 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As a little boy, do you remem ber your  father leaving when he was  for c ed to go to 
forc ed labor?
 
> > Albert Garih:  Oh, yes . Oh, yes . I still r em ember. We wer e living in a subur b. Us ually to go to the 
Metr o
 
--
 
the Metr o was  right at the gate of Paris . When Paris was  liber ated, that's  where they c ame into 
Paris . So that was  the Metro s tation. And us ually 
you 
would take a bus  to go fr om wher e we lived to 
that Metr o station but that day we wanted to s pend as muc h time as we c ould with my father . It was 

about a 20
-
m inute walk so we walked all the way to the Metr o. 
And my father had this  gas  m ask
 
bec aus e from  the Fir st WorldWar wher
e they were us ing gas , they had been given s ome gas  ma
sks 
jus t in c as e. I was  playing with that gas  mask  before he left. Actually I was  playing with it, putting it on. 
But anyway, I was  4 years  old, you know. So he took  his  gas m ask and we walked him all the way to 
the Metro station. And I rem em ber  m y mother was , of c our s e, crying bec aus e s he didn't know whether 

s he would ever s ee her hus band again. And we went bac k  home after that and my father took the 
Metro.
 
> > Bill Bens on: With your father gone, your mother  would find a hiding place for you with Madame 

Galops .
 
How did that c ome about?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  She was  des perate to find
 
--
 
s he knew it was  ver y dangerous  for  us to
 
stay hom e. 
Bec aus e any m om ent, the Ger man boots  would c ome up the stair s  and bang on the door  and tak e us  
away. 
And
 
it would be the Frenc h polic e. You know, the big r oundup that I was  m entioning befor e 
wher e 13,000 people wer e deported and killed, it was  perform ed by 4,000 polic em en, Fr enc h 
polic em en. It was  the Frenc h polic e that was  useful for  that dirty job, actually.
 
So m y m other  was  very 
c onc er ned about that. 
 
 
One day s he met Madame 
Galops
 
in a street market. She didn't know her, ac tually. But, you 
know, in thos e days  s omehow people have antennas
; y
ou know, s he felt she c ould open u
p to this  lady. 
She told her s he was  terrified that at any mom ent they c ould c ome and take us  away. Madam e 
Galops
 
went bac k  hom e and told her hus band. The next day her hus band c ame with a c ar t and we took  
whatever  we c ould with us .We went to live with the
 
Galops family. It was the happies t time for me 
dur ing that per iod, the happies t tim e that we had.
 

 
The 
G
alop
s 
fam ily was  ador able. Mons ieur  
Galops
 
was  fun, always  telling us  s tories , building 
toys  for us. Ther e wer e no toys . I r em ember  he built us  I think
 
for Chris tmas  s ome 
p
iggy banks. They 
looked like a small s afe, you know. He was  very nic e. He was telling a story.
 
 
The only thing that was  bad, and it was  not their fault, was  the food. The food was  ver y 
scar ce. 
We had 
to m ak e due with whatever was  available. So it was  not good.
 
 
The 
Galops
 
family had two daughters . In 1943
. 
I was  5. The daughter s were 4 and 3. So it 
was  great playmates with me, for me. Mons ieur  Galops  was  a s c ulptor. He was  m aking s ets  for movie 
s tudios . And they had a big war ehous e behind the hous e where all of the sets  were stored. We had 
great hide and s eek games  in that warehous e with the two little gir ls . And they had a small s helter in 
the yard. It was
 
--
 
if a bom b had fallen on our head, the s helter wouldn't have s erve the any purp
ose. It 
would have been c rus hed. But anyway, that's how we lived for  about s ix months.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the Galops  did this  at risk to them s elves .
 
> > Albert Garih:  The Galops
,  
to m e, thes e people were abs olutely her oic . To take a J ewis h family into 
hi
ding like that was  ver y dangerous  for them. They c ould have been deported. They c ould have been 
s ent to a c onc entr ation cam p. And their  daughters . They had two daughters . So thes e people, to me, 
it's  beyond
 
--
 
very often I ask mys elf if I wer e in that s ituation whether I would have that c our age to do 
that. It's  r eally s om ething that is  beyond im agination, actually. Thes e people wer e abs olutely 

phenom enal.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the s pr ing of 1944, however , your  m other  had to tak e the fam ily fr om the Galops  
hom e.
 
Tell us  how that was . And then your m other being the liones s  that you des c ribed, what did she 
do then
? 
But fir st, why did you have to leave this  hom e? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  Well, we had to leave for a very good reas on. The Galops  fam ily were living in a sm
all 
s tr eet. Ther e wer e about 10 hous es in that str eet. And ever ybody knew ev eryone. And, of c ours e, when 
they s aw this  wom an with thr ee c hildren living with the Galops fam ily, they s tar ted s ome r um ors , you 

8 
 
know. Som e people were wondering. The Galops  s aid that we were fam ily fr om the countr ys ide, whic h 
didn't m ake s ens e bec aus e when people had family in the c ountrys ide
; 
they would r ather go to the 
family in the c ountrys ide than bring the people to their  home. So it didn't make s ens e. So the people 

were not 
buying that argument.
 
 
Thes e hous es wer e oc c upied by ar tis ts, s c ulptors , painters. One of them, a painter, his wife 
was  a s ym pathizer s  of the Germ ans . And the one day s he c am e to 
M
adam
e 
Galops  and s aid, "When 
ar e you going to get r id of that s c um?" We were the s c um .
 
So at that point M
adam
e 
Galops  and my 
m other  thought we had no c hoic e but to go hom e and that's what we did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You went back  to your  apartment?
 
> > Albert Garih:  We went back  to our apar tm ent. And s ure enough, a few weeks  later a
 
bang on the 
door , 8:00
 
in the m or ning. I was  s till in bed. Two Fr enc h polic e ins pectors. 
ﬁ
Madam
r  
Garih
?ﬂ ﬁ
Yes .
ﬂ ﬁ
We 
c am e to take you away.
ﬂ  
That was  what my m other was  dr eading all along. She s tar ted s haking. The 
ins pec tors, for whatever r eas on
 
--
 
it was  
m or e or les s  around the time of D
-
Day. So think  that the war  
was  over  for  them, they wer e los ing. I don't know. Maybe jus t a s ens e of humanity. They de
c ided to let 

us  go. They s aid, 
We'r e going to r eport we didn't find you but you m ust not stay in your apartm ent. 
Have to find another hiding plac e.
 

 
It's  not s o eas y to find a plac e like that but they s aid you mus t not s leep in your bed tonight. 
That was  how they put it. It was  very blunt. They
 
said they wer e going to s end 
s om e other  people to put 
s eals  on the door and if they find you, they ar e going to take you away.
 
 
So I was  awakened by the c omm otion. I was  still in bed. It was  6:00
 
--
 
8:00
 
in the mor ning. I 
was  6 year s  old. My m other would not s end m e to s c hool. She was  afraid to s end me to s c hool 

bec aus e s om etim es  they would go to s chool, take the c hildren, and the parents  would never hear of 
them again. So ther e was  that danger .
 
My sis ter s, s he had no c hoic e bec aus e they were older  and the 
s c hool was  m andator y for them. So they c ould not s tay home. They had to go to s c hool. But for  m e my 
m other  would keep m e hom e most of the time. Som etim es  I would go to a kindergar ten but ver y 
oc c as ionally.
 
 
So s he dres s ed me ver y quickly and we went to see a s oc ial worker that she had been given 
t
he nam e, I gues s. I don't know exac tly how s he k new the s oc ial wor ker . She explained the s ituation. 
The s oc ial wor ker  s aid, you know, give me a few days ; I cannot find a s olution like that overnight.
 
In the m eantim e, tr y to see If you c annot s leep at your  
neighbors. 
 
 
And that's what we did.
 
My m other and I would s leep on the next door neighbor's
 
--
 
this  
Com munis t c ouple, had a young daughter about my age and they were working on night s hift. She was  

working in a s hop. He was  working on rod iron. I don't know exac tly why but they wer e working on night 

s hifts s o we would s leep in their  bed at night and in the mor ning we would give them  the bed.
 
 
My s is ters  stayed with the lodge keeper downs tairs . The lodge
 
k eeper was  a woman with 
three young childr en, 14, 12,
 
and
 
a little gir l who was  about
 
5 years old. Her  hus band had been tak en 
pr is oner . Never  s aw her husband either. So m y s is ter s lept in the lodge
 
keeper's apartment. We stayed 
like that for a few days  until eventually the s oc ial wor ker c am e back  to my mother and s aid, ok, I found 

a plac e for eac h one of you.
 
 
My m other was  plac ed as  a gover nes s with a family near  the Eiffel Tower , ac tually. She was  
fac ing the Eiffel Tower . The family had eight or  10 c hildren. I don't remem ber the exac t num ber . It was  
a big f
amily. She was  taking c are of all of thes e kids . And we were s ent to a s uburb northeast of Paris  
c alled Montferm eil whic h was  made famous  in "Les  Mis er ables ," actually. That's where J ean Valjean 

m eets Cos ette when s he goes  to pick  up water, Montferm eil.
 
 S
o we were in Catholic  boar ding s c hools . I was  in a s c hool for  boys  and my s is ter s  in the 
s c hool for  gir ls. And we would meet every Sunday in c hurc h. The Catholic  boar ding sc hools , we would 
go to c hurc h ever y Sunday. That's the only tim e that I was  s eeing my s is ter s . And my mother
,  
I didn't 
have any news  about m y m other. And you know, at 6 years  old, you get us ed to that. I don't r emem ber 

that it even bothered m e that I was m is s ing m y mother or anything like that. My m other was  out of the 
pic tur e as  far as  I
 
was  c onc erned. I was  6 years  old. That was  it.
 

9 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  it like for you to be in this  Catholic  s c hool
? 
What were the c onditions
? 
It was  
a boarding sc hool, as  you s aid.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Well, onc e again the big problem was  the food. The food was  terrible. Ther e was  a 
m om ent I got s ick, ac tually. And I was not the only one. I was  ver y s kinny.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Terr ible bec aus e of the terr ible shortages of food.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Shortage. And the food we got was  r otten.We had r otten beans . So I was  s ic k  all the 

tim e. I los t a lot of weight. It was  only about thr ee months. It was  the s ummer of 1944. June
 
6, 1944, 
was  D
-
Day when will Allies  landed in Normandy. We were near ing the end of that or deal but still we 
didn't have enough food. The foo
d was  ter r ible. 
 
 
So I would meet my s is ter s  in c hurc h. And the food was  terr ible but I r em ember one day I had 
a feast. The pr ies t in the s c hool was  s uffering from  s or t of c anc er or  s omething, you know, of the 

s tomac h. They m anaged to get a c ouple of potatoes  for  him  and a piec e of butter and they made s ome 
m as hed potatoes. But even that he c ouldn't s wallow. So guess  what. Who was  fed the leftover s  of the 
pr ies t? 
Yours  truly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you r em em ber  that.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes . To this  day I still
 
r em em ber  thes e mas hed potatoes . And I love mas hed potatoes .
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, did they know you wer e Jewis h c hildren? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  There m us t have been s om eone in the s c hool who took  m e in hiding in that s c hool. I 
s us pec t it m us
t have been the head mis tr es s becaus e s he was  partic ularly good with m e. She was  
always  very protec tive. She was  always  taking m y hand. I was  just 6 year s old. The c hildr en in that 

s c hool wer e older . I think  it started at 7 and up to 14. So I was  really the youngest. And it was  the 
s um m er  s o the sc hool was  ver y r elaxed. We didn't have m uc h c las s es but we s till had s ome c las s es .
 

 
While we wer e with the Galops  family, m y mother  had taught m e how to read and wr ite 
alr eady s o I knew how to read and wr ite. I was
 
6 years  old. But you had s om e c hildr en ther e who wer e 
pr obably not good s tudents  and c ouldn't do that. We were in c las s, you know, in the s am e c las s , in the 
s am e room. Each floor  was a differ ent gr ade. So I was  put with the babies  and doing s trokes like t
hat. 
And I rem em ber  I c ould alr eady write, read and wr ite, ac tually, but I was  s till doing s tr okes  like that. 
Any way.
 
 
So we s tayed ther e. And I r em em ber  als o fr om that period when there wer e s om e raids, s om e 
air  raids , ther e was  a bombar dment c om ing or s om ething, we would go to the s helters, underground, 
and when the air r aid was over, the s ir en would blas t again to announc e the end of the raid, we would 
c om e out. And one of my favorite gam es
 
--
 
and appar ently I s har e that with Har ry
, 
yes ter day
 
--
 
was  to 
p
ic k  up piec es of s hrapnel in the playgr ound. I had a big c ollec tion of s hr apnel that I br ought hom e 
when my m other took  me hom e, whic h s he very quickly dis pos ed of. But, yes , that was  one of m y 

hobbies  to c ollec t s hrapnel.
 
And you know, I r emem ber one was  about that big. It was  jagged like that. 
When you r ec eive that in your body, it does n't do any good, actually. So that was  one of our favorite 

gam es
; 
6 years old what do 
you expec t? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, as  you mentioned, D
-
Day, J une
 
1944. Paris  was  liber ated in August
 
1944. You 
were 6. What do you recall or know about liber ation and then about the reunific ation of your  m other and 

your  s is ter s and you? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  What do I rec all
? 
Boy, I r ec all
 
--
 
I r em ember that like it was  yes ter day. Actually,
 
we 
were in that sc hool. A kid
 
--
 
you had two kinds of boar ding s c hools  in Fr anc es . You had boar ding 
s c hools  whic h wer e very s elec t, wher e you put the c hildren of the best fam ilies  and wher e they get very 

good educ ation
,  
and you had the boar ding s c hools  wher e people say the children are s uch bad 
s tudents they s ay if you are not a good student, I'm  going to put you in a boar ding s c hool. And that was  
the kind of boarding sc hool wher e I was .
 
 
One of the boys  had r un away the day befor e or something. Ever ybody was  up in
 
arms  
bec aus e it was  the war . It was  dangerous. And the next mor ning the boy came back  and said "The 
allies  ar e c oming!  The allies  ar e c om ing!"  So I don't know whether  he was  punis hed or not but all I 

10
 
 
r em em ber is  we all went on the m ain s
tr eet a
nd we s aw all the tanks , all the jeeps, all the s oldiers  with 
fr iendly fac es
, n
ot with the Germ an helm et but with the Am eric an helmet. 
 
 
And it was  fir st tim e I had ever  hear d of the Am eric ans . I had never  hear d of the Am er ic ans 
before. I knew everything a
bout the Germ ans , the Italians , the Rus s ians, the Br itis h, the Fr enc h. The 
Am eric ans
? 
Who are thes e people
? 
Wher e are they c om ing fr om
? 
I had no idea. Needless to s ay I was  
far from thinking that one day I would be one of them.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Albert Garih:  So yeah. I remem ber thes e friendly fac es giving us  c hewing gum, s ugar. Not sugar , 
c hoc olate. Candy, even c igarettes . They wer e dis tributing c igar ettes  to c hildr en.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Albert Garih:  That's when we wer e liberated. This  mem or y is  abs olutely phenomenal. That's one of 

the best mom ents I had in my life when we s aw this . Bec aus e, you know, som ehow, I was  6 year s  old 
and I must have felt that ther e was  s omething wr ong in the way I was  living
, th
e fac t that 
we wer e liv ing, 
you know, in hiding like that. It m ust have struck  m e at that point and s ay that's  it. This  is  taken off our  

c hes t. This  is the end of our  mis ery. This is  the end of the thr eat.Whew. It was  a liberation, really a 
liberation.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You c an only im agine what it felt like for your  mom.
 
> > Albert Garih:  My m other  was  in Par is . She witnes sed firs thand. She was

as I s aid, s he was  in an

Fr ench r es is tanc e and the Allies . It was  a Frenc h 
A

nam e of General Lec ler c who bec ame a hero. He died unfortunately pr ematur ely in a plane cras h 

s hor tly after the war . He was  r eally a hero. He had taken an oath that he would liber ate Paris and 
Strasbourg. I don't know why Str as bourg. Stras bourg was  under Germ an oc c upation. So he had tak en 

an oath that he would liber ate Par is  and Str as bourg.
 
 
So when the allies  landed in Norm andy and they wer e m oving east towar ds  Germany, 
ac tually, Gener al Lec lerc asked for s pec ial per miss ion of Eis enhower  to take his  2
nd
 A
rmored 
D
ivis ion, 
Fr ench s oldier s to liberate Par is . Eis enhower  ac cepted his  r equest. And that's how Par is  was  liber ated, 

by Frenc h s oldiers. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you s aid, this huge relief, off your ches t of all the stres s, but you were still 
hungry and s tar ving. What happened?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Well, you know, the r estr ictions  las ted even after the war. It ac tually took  a while 

before we could have a nor m al diet, ac tually.
 
As  s oon 
as  we wer e liberated, we wer e east of Paris  s o 
s inc e the allies  were moving eas t, we were liber ated a few days  after Par is . So Par is  had been 
liberated. And as s oon as  train s er vic e was  r es tored, m y mother was  on the fir st tr ain. She c am e to s ee 
us .
 
 
And you know what
? 
My sisters
 
--
 
the sc hools  wer e not far from  eac h other. They c am e and 
they s aid, "Guess  who is  her e." I had no c lue. I didn't think at all about m y mother. My m other  was  out 
of the pictur e as  far as I was  c onc er ned. Of c ourse, when I pus hed t hem bec aus e I was  cur ious  to s ee 

who c ame to vis it us , when I s aw m y m other, of cour s e I jumped into her ar m s.
 
 
We wer e s o skinny and so s tarved that m y m other had thes e r ation tickets  with whic h to buy 
br ead. Ever ything was  on tickets , r ation tickets. She
 
bought a loaf of br ead that we s wallowed in no 
tim e. That's just how we were. She took  us r ight bac k  home.
 
 
Meanwhile, m y father, who was  in the Channel Islands , he was  wes t of the Norm andy 
beaches , ac tually. Sinc e the Germans had m anaged
 
--
 
the allies  ha
d m anaged to m ak
e the Germ ans  
believe that if
 
ther e was  a landing, it would take plac e in the s tr aits whic h was  the s hortes t dis tance 
between Franc e and Britain, they were bombar ding there all the time and des tr oying all the 
fortific ations .
 
 
So in May, one
 
m onth befor e D
-
Day, the inmates  in the c amp wher e m y father was , were 
tr ansferr ed to the
 
Straits  of Dover
 
wher e they started repair ing the fortific ations , under the fir e, and all of 
that. My father told me one day when there was  a bom bar dm ent like that, they had to lay flat on the 
ground, with the
 
str afing
, and ever ything. He was  lay ing on the ground next to German s oldiers . And 

11
 
 
when the raid was  over , m y father got up and the German s oldiers  staid down, was  killed. It was  really 
danger ous .
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
So then
 
--
 
tell us about your father c oming hom e bec aus e they were eventually 
evac uated and taken with the Ger mans .
 
> > Albert Garih:  They were near  the Belgian border . At that point they wer e in the Straits of Dover . At 

one point the Germ ans we
re retr eating. They decided they would put the 900 inm ates  on a tr ain bound 

for Ger many whether they were going to us e them  as s lave labor  in a fac tory or they were going to 
s end them to a death c am p, I have no idea. But any way, the tr ain
 
--
 
they were being s hipped
 
by train 
towar ds  Ger many. The train was  s topped in northern Belgium  by a Belgian Res is tanc e, par tis ans, who 

had bur ned up the r ailr oad. The tr ain was  s topped. Ther e was  a back door. And in the c onfus ion, the 
Germ ans r eleas ed all the 900 inmates. My father s omehow, I don't know how he m ade his  way, he 

m ade his way bac k to Paris . It took  him about two, three weeks. And the mor ning of Rosh Has hanah, 
the J ewis h 
New Y
ear , he ar rived. 
 
 
That m or ning was  the firs t tim e
 
--
 
m y mother was  dr es s ing m e to go to s ynagog
ue, the fir st 
tim e s inc e before the war . Befor e the war I was  not going to s ynagogue. I was  too s mall. To me it would 
have been the fir st tim e I would have gone to s ynagogue. Knock  on the door, als o at 8:00
 
in the 
m or ning. It was my father. It took my moth
er a few s ec onds  to rec ognize him . He was  gaunt. We wer e 

living in an apartm ent building with a long c orr idor, whic h was  dark. When the light was  not on, it was  

dark. It took  her a few s ec onds  to r ealize that it was  her hus band who was there. So we wer e r e
united. 
So my nuc lear fam ily, my father, m y m other, my s is ter s and I, we s urvived. But as I s aid, m y 
grandm other and unc le and aunt and two c ous ins  wer e killed during the exodus . And m y m other lost 
s om e c ous ins  who wer e s ent to the c am ps, never to be s een 
again. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, I think  we have time for a c ouple of ques tions fr om our audienc e. Can we do 
that? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Sure.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e not going to have tim e to hear  about Septem ber
 
1944 when the families 
r eunited, Par is  is liberated, but the war  would c ontinue until May
 
1945 and s o they continued to live in 
war
-
like c onditions , s c arc ities, and then, of cour se, had to es tablis h a new life and begin over  again. 
Eventually, as  you know the stor y we told a little bit in the introduction, eventually Albert made it to the 
United States  and began his  family.
 
 
We don't have tim e for all of that but we have time for  a couple of questions . If you have a 
question, we ask  that you wait until you get a m icr ophone. There will be one c oming
 
down either  s ide of 
the ais le, I believe. Get the m ic rophone. Then m ake your question as br ief as  you c an. I'll r epeat the 
question jus t to m ake s ure ever ybody hear s  it. And then Albert will r es pond to it.
 
 
Do we have any brave s ouls
? 
We have one gentlem a
n right here ready to ask a question. The 
m ic r ophone is  c oming down 
to you.
 
> > Yes. I'm jus t ver y c ur ious . Families  like the Galops , did you have a c hanc e to r ec onnec t with the 
c hildren that wer e your age fr om the families  that helped you? 
 

> > Bill Bens on:
  
Did you have a c hanc e to r ec onnec t with fam ilies  like the Galops  who helped you
? 
I'm 
s o glad you asked that bec aus e we didn't get to that question.
 

> > Albert Gar ih:  Yeah. Ac tually, r ec onnec ted is  the r ight wor d.We los t touc h with them, ac tually. 
Unfor t
unately. In the late 1980s , early 1990s ,
 
I told my stor y to a fr iend who was  living in Is rael. She 
s aid, "Have you ever tr ied to have thes e people rec ognized as  r ighteous am ong the nations ?"  I s aid, 

"What is  that?"  I had no idea about that pr ogram . And she told me. She gave me the nam e of the 
per s on to c ontact, to tell my s tor y. I had the Galops  fam ily, and the Communis t neighbors r ec ognized 

as  r ighteous  am ong the nations .
 
 
As  I s aid, I had los t tr ack  of them but I m anaged to find Madam e 
Galops
 
bac k  in 1990 or 1991. 
I was  in Fr anc e. I looked
 
--
 
we had a sm all c omputer type of phone book in Franc e c alled Minitel. I 
looked and I found Madam e Galop
s
, found a phone num ber. I c alled her. I s aid, "Are you the widow of 

Gabr iel Galops?," 
ﬁY
eah, yeah.
ﬂ  
I went, 
ﬁ
I'm
 
Garih.
ﬂ 
She went, 
ﬁO
h!
ﬂ
  
She was  s o s ur pr is ed. I s aid, 
ﬁ
Madame Galops
ﬂ --
 
it was  the end of the year. I s aid, I c annot c om e now to see you but I pr omis e the 

12
 
 
next tim e I c ome to Fr anc e I will go to s ee you. And I went to Franc e a few months  later . She wa
s 
living 
in the South of Franc e. I flew there and we were reunited. It was  a wonderful m om ent, actually. She 
loved me like a s on, ac tually. And I loved her  like another mother.
 
 
And las t year , I went back  to Franc e. I go to Fr anc e about onc e a year . Las t yea
r I had a 
c hanc e to be r ec onnected not with Madam e 
Galops
 
bec aus e Madam e Galop
s
, you know
 
--
 
the Galops  
and neighbor s  r ec ognized as  r ighteous am ong the nations but only m ons ieur for the awarding made all 
of the r ighteous. Madam e 
Galops
 
died a few m onths  before the c er em ony. But I was  there for the 
c er emony in Montferm eil. I was  r eunited with the two daughters .
 
 
Unfortunately in the pas t few year s  both of them  pas s ed away. But las t year  I had a c hanc e to 
be reunited with their c hildr en. So I m et the gr anddaughter s of the Galops  fam ily las t year . And they 

were eager to hear from  m e about how it was
 
--
 
how when we lived together with their gr andpar ents . I 
told them
 
--
 
I was  r aving about their grandparents. Bec aus e I s aid what they did is  beyond the wor ds , 
ac tua
lly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.We'r e going to c los e the pr ogram  now. I know there are s om e other 
questions . It's our tr adition at
 
Firs t Pers on
 
that our Fir s t Per son has the las t word s o I'm going to turn 
bac k  to Alber t in a few mom ents to c los e the pr ogram.When he's  done, he will s tay up on the s tage. So 

abs olutely, feel free to c ome up and ask  him your question or if you just want to get your photo taken 
with him or  say hi, whatever. Albert will s tay behind to anybody who would like to vis it with him.
 

 
I want to thank all of you for being with us  today, remind you that we'll hav e a
 
First Person
 
pr ogram  eac h Wednes day and Thur s day until the m iddle of August. So I hope that if you're loc al, you 

c an c ome back  and if you're not, you'll m ake another trip her e. If not, look to the webs ite for our 
pr ogram  next year in the hope that you'll be back  in Was hington, D.C. 
 
 
And s o on that note, Alber t, thank you s o m uc h. Let's hear your  las t thoughts .
 
>> 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Conc luding remarks. You know, I thought about that. This  pas t Monday was  Mem or ial 
Day. We s aw all of thes e programs on PBS about the pr es ident going to lay a wr eath on the m onum ent 
of the unknown s oldiers  and we s aw the c emetery in Arlington with all of thes e white c ros s es and white 
S
tars o
f David. I have s een that. And ever y year  on Memor ial Day I c an't help thinking about thes e 
young men who c am e, so many of them los t their lives  for  us to live in freedom , to r id us  of the tyranny 
of the Nazis . I always  have a thought for thes e people bec aus e I s aw them firsthand when we were 
liberated. I s aw thes e fr iendly fac es. I have a s pecial c onnec tion with them .
 
 
If I want to c onc lude now, I would say in all this  hour  that we went thr ough, and wor s e, 
ac tually, I was bles s ed that ther e wer e s o m any people who wer e s o willing to s tick  their neck  out for us 

whether  it was  the Galops fam ily, the m ilitar y, the head mistres s of the s c hool, the Catholic  boar ding 
s c hool, all of thes e people. I would have loved to have had the head mis tres s  as r ec ognized am ong
 
the 
r ighteous  of
 
the nation. And I went back to Montferm eil 
and I r ec ognized
 
--
 
found the sc hool exac tly the 
s am e as  it was  exc ept it was  fr es hly painted. And as  I s aid, it was  the place, Montferm eil, where J ean 
Valjean met Cos ette in "Les  Mis erables ." And to m y big s urpris e, the s c hool is  now a s em inary where 

they are tr aining young m is sionaries , Afric an m iss ionar ies , to go back  to Afr ic a. It's c alled Ins titution 
Valjean.
 
I wanted to do som e res earc h about the head mistres s but the people I s aw
 
--
 
ther e w
er e 
young s ecretar ies . They had no idea about what I was  talking about. They were muc h too young. And I 

didn't have m uc h time. I didn't have enough time to purs ue any r es ear c h. I would have loved to have 
had her r ec ognized als o as a r ighteous. She des er ved
 
that.
