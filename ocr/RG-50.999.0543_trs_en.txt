(Applause) 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I didn't know if you have apref erence.
 
>> Halina Peabody: 
 
Not really. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So thank you very m uch, Halina,for joining ustoday.  So you were 
born inKrakow buthow long did you li ve there. 
 
Halina Peabody:  My fam ilies both aref rom Krakow, butm y parents when they got 
m arried,they went toa place
 
calls Zaleszczyk i.  I think did you mention that? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I didn't mention Zaleszczyk i.  I try not to say it becauseI 
m ispronounce it. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, it was all the way down onthe (inaudible) of  Romania. Now 
it ' s  Uk ra in e  b ut  it  wa
s Rom ania and we were living in a place calledZaleszc zyki.  My m other 
went to her mothertogive birth toboth m y sister and to me. So that's wh y even though we're 

all f rom Krakow but we lived in Zaleszczyk i.  So in1939 we were li vi ng in Zaleszczyki.  M
y 
father was a dentist and that's why he m ovedto a sm allertown where he opened surgery.  

Andm y m other was ahomem akerbut shehad beena champion swi m mer of Poland.  So she 

was happy because there was a river there. W eused to go kayaking on the river.
  
And the 
ri ver was a naturalf ront with Rom ania.  You could go half way and then there were boys there 

so you wouldn't go any further. W e hadbeaches there.T he weather was absolutely fantastic.  

W ehadf our distinct seasons.  Very, very cold  winter, which m eant thatm y m other could take 

andteachm e skating bef ore I wasf ive, andshe also was teaching m eto ski, to ski. And 

altogether.  And then the summ er of coursewe were
 
--
 
we were on the water andonthe beach 
m o st of  th e  time . 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So 
you're
 
--
 
let m e back up a little.  You were born in '32, 1932.  Your 
parents, how did theym eet?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,m y f ather was aver y good
-
looking young m an andm y 
m other was ver y f am ous atthe age of 18, having won the championship of Poland.  
S o I gu e ss 

that's whathappened.  And they met in Krakow. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  But they were
 
--
 
were they from  a traditional Jewis hf am ily or were 
they m ore secular?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m other was with a com pletely non
-
religious fam ily.  Im ean, 
they
 
--
 
th
ey observed som e holidays butnotm uch.  My father cam e f rom a very reli gious 
fam ily.  But mostly people who had becom eprofessionals in PolandandKrakow, they
 
--
 
t h e y 
were not
 
--
 
they stopped being religious.  Andplus m y mother didn'tspeak Yiddish and 
s he 
didn't cook Jewish stuff so we were not religious. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shedidn't speak Yiddish but yourf ather did.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My father had but, you know, I never heard him. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder:  So where did he go to dental school?
 
>> Ha lin a  P e
abody:  In Krakow.
 
>>W arren Marcus:  In Krakow. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you described this very i dyllic l if e.  I've seen pictures of your 

3 
 
p re
-
war lif e.  It was beautif ul.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, it was beautif ul. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: 
 
How m any older than you are you than Eva, your sister?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She's six anda half  years younger than me. She was borntwo 
m onthsbefore the war, June 30th. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T he thing that really strikes m e whenI read your story and I look
 
a t 
thepictures is that your m other is suddenly alonebecause yourfather has to
 
--
 
basically he 
goes into Romania.  Can you describe whathappenstohim?  Yes,1939 when we understood, 
even though I was notquite seven, Im ean, Iknew that the Russians were com ing tooccupy 

us because Russiansandthe Germ ans splitPoland in two in1939. Som y father, knowing 

that previous war
 
--
 
the war f irst, they took the rations whenthey occupied. T hey took themen 
into the Arm y by f orce and you couldn't getoutf or20 years. Soa lot of men, includingmy 

father, crossed over toRom ania.  Now, som epeople tookfam ilies with them.  Some didn't. My 

father didn't because he was af raidfor m y sister.  She was a baby and she
 
--
 
thought there 
would be nothing else,facilitiesf orm y sister.  So we stayed behind. So very shortly af ter the 

Russians were obtained,m y f atherhad gone.  However, af tera littletim e elapsedand the 

Russians pilf ered and im prisonedall the
 
--
 
all them em bers there that were leaders inthe town
, 
andm y father and some other people also thought about it twice and tried to com eback, 

qu i c k l y k i n d  of  on
 
--
 
under the cover of a sheet or af rozen river, tried to crossback,and by 
then the Russians sealed theborderand they caught them  all,put them
 
in prison, and said 
they were spies. T here were trials andm yf ather got 20 years hardlabor and was sent to 

Siberia. So that's when we were lef talone. Andnotonly that, because the law
 
--
 
the Russian 
law says apparently if there is som eone a crim inal, quote, unquotemy f atherthe dentist,then 

thefam ily also gets to Russia, to be on the gulag somewhere.  However for some unknown 

reasontous they didn't take usbutthey didthrow us outof  our house because this was 

bourgeois we couldhave a house. 
 
And we were told to go to a littletown calledT luste, just up 
the road, very close by, and that's where we spent the time thattheRussians occupied Poland.  

In between
 
--
 
so '41.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Let m e back up a little because
 
I wanted toask about your father.  
W hat I was going to reference isthere is aphotographthat we saw of  your mother, you, and a 

baby.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andnofather.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  He's already gone. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andso your m other isnow having to deal with
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: The two of us. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  A 7
-
year
-
old anda 1
-
year
-
old, a baby.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andhow did shedo it? 
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, by m iracle. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber what it was likef orher? You couldn't know
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Iwent to school and she took care of us.  My m otherhad a lot of 
f riends andthey, I think, supported her. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you think she hada nice network m aybe.
 
>> H a l i
na Peabody:  Absolutely, yes, because we were not rich.  So we def initely hada 

4 
 
network.  
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W asyour mother
 
--
 
what kind of person was she?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She was belovedby everybody and I'm not just saying that.  She 
was m y m otherbut she really was.  T hat's probably why I still m eetpeople thathave known 
her that tell me the sam e thing. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So when yourfather leaves, when he's taken actually, after he leaves.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Did
 
--
 
was your 
m other inform ed that he was arrested, that he was 
sentenced to 20 yearshard labor?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, went to where he was held in that terribleprison where he 
was held and said good
-
bye. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Eastern Poland.  One whole year we didn't hear anything and my 
father didn't talkaboutit.  I don't know what they did there.  Butaf ter a year he corresponded a 

little bit just before the Germ ans decided to com e back the restof  it.  1948.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  So at that tim e wecorresponded, hada couple of letters 
back andforth.  So we knew he was at (inaudible) and we knew he was am edical off icer 

because there were no doctors there sotheym ade him  a medicaloff icer in the cam p.  But 

that's wherehe was. And then them om entwe heard that theGerm ans were com ing, the 

Russians were sofeared and we went back to ourhouse. But of  course we lost contact with 

father altogether.  
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you're inT lusteand your m other decides (inaudible).  And what is 
going on thatm akes your mother suddenly
 
--
 
shebecom esf earful and you run?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, no, that'sa long time af ter.  No.  No.  You've jumped a little.  
No, we com e back to Zaleszczyk i and await the Germ ans. T he Germ ans eventually
 
--
 
they 
com e and occupy the rest of
 
Poland. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  In 1941.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, including of  courseZaleszc zyki where we are now back at 
home. And they putus
 
--
 
there are som e very strict la ws, particularly f or the Jews.  No schools 
for Jewish children altogether.  Curfew,
 
yello w stars on the houses, yellow stars on the 
arm bands.  Now, I was lucky thatm y f athertaught me to read and write just before going to 

kindergarten. He thought I should know thatso I would be the best in the kindergarten.
 
(Laughter)
 
I swear that was it, butI don't rem em ber any of  it. Asfar as I know I've always known 
how to read Polishand wr ite Polish. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So now you're
 
--
 
but you'reliving under German occupation. You're 
seeing things starting to happen.
 
>> Ha lin a  
Peabody:  Iactually am fully aware  what's happening.  And the Germ ans 
createa Jewish comm ittee of  the Jewish leaders so that they have differentdem ands. Of  

course they have demanded the same as the Russians, whatever pictures,m oney,f oreign 

m oney.  (inaudible) was deathpenalty. W edon't know what's going on in the restof  the world.  

And we justhopefor the best. Very, ver y cooperative. W e just triedto do the best, you know.  

W ethinkone occupation to the otherone.  My m other is just trying to take careof  the children 

and somehow survi ve.
 
T he Germ ans, as I said, had this Jewish comm ittee and they had various demands 
now.  Every Je w had to be working f or the Germ ans.  So inm y m other's case they knew m y 

m other was also a wonderf ul knitter. She used to knit everything in the house.  Everything was 

5 
 
knit including beautiful, what is it called, lace. Shedid lace, shedid (inaudible) and sweaters 
andeverything I had on was alwa ys knitted by her.  And they put her
 
--
 
her job was to knitfor 
the m ay
or of the townwho was Germ an,hischildren.  He had lots of  children.  So that was her 
job.  If there was noparticular jobf oranybody, they were told to clean the sidewalks.  Andalso 

they used totake groups of young peopleforvarious jobs outsideof  town.  Sothey would go 

out in the morning and they would be broughtback inthe af ternoon 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm eask you quickly, are you talking
 
--
 
at thispoint were you in a 
ghetto?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So itwasn't in a ghetto y
e t.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, not in Zaleszczyki. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So people were being taken out to
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, they were just taken various jobs, you know. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Labor.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Labor, exactly. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  And let's be clear, you weren't getting paidf orthe labor.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Of  coursenot.  Of course not.  No. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I just wanted to be clear. Your mother's perform ing slave labor.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely, absolutely, yes.  Yeah, you see, I wasn't very 
concerned with that becausem oney didn't
 
--
 
didn't come into play in m y lif e. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Butessentially what you're saying is you had tohave a job to stay 
alive, to keep
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, you had to work for the Germ ans.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  And if theyf ound that you were an adult
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  They knew ever ybody.  T hey toldm y m other she was going to be 
a knitter because they hada list of everybody. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So they assigned you jobs.
 
>> Halina Peabody:
  
So they assigned all the jobs, yes.  So there was no such thing as 
not knowing. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber atall what lif e was like during this time period?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  It was ver y scary.  No w, we m ostly were ver y s cared and just tried 
to
 
cooperate.W hatever they asked, peoplewere will ing to accomm odate them.  And then not 
ver y long af terwards they dem andeda ratherlarge number of people, the young people, they 

neededa group of them  to bind treesf or thewinter, they said. 
 
>> S u z y S n y
der:  Bind trees f or the winter.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, the trunks because it was a ver y cold winter, they said.  So 
nobody thought anything of it andthey saidthat they needed to getthese young people towalk 

up the road, it was just a
 
--
  
>> S u z y S n y
der: W ho dem anded these people.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Pardon? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W ho dem anded thesepeople, the Germ ans?
 
>> Halina Peabody: The Germ ans demanded it through the Jewish comm ittee. And 
then they walked up the road and then they were supposed to do the binding of the trees. And 

we waitedf or them  tocom e back, asusual. And they didn't com eback.  And we didn't know 

what was happening, got very anxious.  Noneof
 
--
 
as young asI was, you can tell that you 
were scared. 
 

6 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Of course you canfeel theanxiety.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  And inthe end, towards theevening oneman cam e and he had 
been shot inthearm and he told the story what happened, which was when they got to 
th e
 
--
 
thisplace where they were supposed to do thetrees,theyf ound an open grave and they 
were all shot.  Infact, they hadplanksover the grave so that they made people lay down and 

shoot them and they dropped as they were shot. And thism an was oneof  the last onestobe 

shot so he was on topof  the grave.  And when the Germ ans lef t, they didn't cover them  very 

m uch. T hey didn't care.  He m anaged to gethim self out and com eback. And apparently they 

m issedhis heart. Justhis arm  was shot. And then he told usthe story.
 
So then we realized that we were al
l 
--
 
that that was theplan.  Because up to then we 
hadno idea whattheywere trying to do andwhat they were going t o do.  So everybody started 

lookingf or hiding places.  T hat was thef irstthing ever ybody did.  And sureenough, very 

short
 
--
 
shortly af terwards they
 
--
 
they dem andedthis tim e a groupof peopleto go to work in 
Germ any.  And everyb ody
 
--
 
nobody believed them  by then, so everybody scatteredaround 
andthen hid.  My m other tookm y sister andm eto a lady who used to cookfor us. And we 

st a
yed there the whole day.  And they m anaged tof ind the
 
--
 
they alwa ys had the numbers, to 
have a set number in the squareand they loadedthem on thetrainandtook themaway.  

Never heardf rom  them  again.  And we knew that this was what we were going to b
e runni n g.  
 
T he  da y
 
--
 
the Germ ans were ver y clever.  T hey didn't want to have the troubleto look 
for us because there were less of us.  It was a sm all town, the com munity wasn't thatbig.  So 

they just threw all the rest of the Jews outto this place calledT lustewhich was the same place 

we were during the Russian occupation. Butat thatpoint, you see, that was later to be a 

ghettobutat that pointit was just anarea.T hey told us to go there. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T o a specific place.
 
>> Halina Peabody
:  Ye s. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W ithin Tluste.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, in Tluste. So we settled inT luste and took whatever we could 
with us.  Andf irst thing everybody started looking was hiding places.  Andmy mother saidto 

m ethat it's not going to do usm uch good becausethey're going tom ove usagain.  You know, 

this obviously becam e
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shehadforesight.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She was guessing that that's what they were going to do. What we 
found out is that not only our com munity was the
re but people f rom  the little comm unities 

around thatarea. So they were all there. That's why it became a ghetto afterwards.  Of  

course we didn't know that. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So they brought all the smaller towns into this town.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right.  W hoever they didn't m anage to kill, they brought them  
altogetherand gathered us there.  Andof  course m y m other was, you know, sodevastated 

sh e  
--
 
she had thesetwo kids and she
 
--
 
sh e ju st
 
--
 
she didn't care about anything except the 
kid s,  a s
 
m ost mothersdo, I'm  sure.  ButI
 
--
 
I could feel the
 
--
 
her angst and she just didn't 
know what to do.  Shetried to send usover to Rom ania some night trips were at night and 

over the river, but nothing worked.  And before we hada chance todo anything
 
again came a 
demandf orpeople towork in Germ any andever ybody scattered. You know, everybody 

found
 
--
 
you know, had found some places where they hid.
 
In our case, m y mother didn't wantto go to the basement where they, you know, 
proposedus to go, because shehad beenthere before so she knew a couple of farm ers there.  

7 
 
And so she decided tosplit us up andputmewith onef arm er and she went with another 
farm er with m y sister.  She paidher an advance and thisf arm er was supposed to keep her 

during the
 
day while they were lookingf or peopleandI was with anotherfarmer who putm eup 
in the lof t.  And allday long I was, you know
 
--
 
the woman was com ing back and telling m e, 
she said thisone in this square, thatone in this square and I knew ever ybody. 
 
So I was sure 
m y m other was caught.  But they didn't say so, but, you know, I was sitting there worrying all 

day long.  And towards the end of the evening they apparently had the right numberand they 

sent them  away.  Andfinally m y m otherdid com e with m y sister to pick m eup.  And when she 

pickedm eup, she said, you know, I was thinking all day long that you were caught. So it was 

the same thing.  She said from  now on we're not going to split up. W hatever happens, allthree 

of  us will go together. And she then told mewhat happened to her,which was thatthe wom an 

got scared in the m iddle of the day and threw her out into af ield. And she said it was an 

em pty f ield with just one bush and she crouched there with m y sister for the restof  theday.  

Sh e
 
said she doesn't know how they didn't see her.T here were airplanesf lying around, they 
were looking f orpeople.  And somehow she m anagednottobe seen.  And so that's why she 

said, you know, we're not going to dothis again because I was sure that you 
were caught.  

And she started again lookingf or other ways
 
--
 
there was really nothing to be done.  So but 
then, you know, she cam eto theone conclusion with herf riends help, very helpful, asI said, 

that we were threefemales
 
--
  
>> >> S u z y S n yd e r :   C a n
 
Iagain just jump inand ask a question?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah?  Youm entionedherf riends.  Are herf riends non
-
Jewish 
f riends? No, Jewish, Jewish f riends. W edidn't know many people
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  So ever ybody is reall y scattering and
 
--
 
>> H
alina Peabody:  Yes, absolutely ever ybody is, yes, yes.  And we
 
--
 
we're all 
in
 
--
 
knowing that this is what's going to happen. Infact,one of herbest friendshasa baby 
also takenat that point.  And so, you know, she's still thinking with the help, wi
th her f riends 
andthinking thatm aybe because there were threefemales they came tothe conclusion that 

we had to maybe a chance if we get false papers,f alse identities. Some people thatm anaged 

to survive. 
 
So they boughtpapers from  a priest inT luste, and we hadtwo suitcases of  what we 
owned and I know herf riends collected som em oney for herand
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hatwas going to be m y next question, how did she
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah, she collectedm oney for herand they took us to the tra
in.   
T hey decided to go tothis place called Jaroslav.  I have no idea why.  It was sortof  half way to 

Krakow but, you know, who knows. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So itwas a com pletely diff erent town,f urther away.   Nobody
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: There were no Jews
 
there anym ore. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andnobody would recognize you.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, we hopednot. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hatwas your goal, tobeunrecognizable.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My sister was too youngso we didn't say anything.  But m y m other 
sa t  
me down, taught me m y new nam e, m y new grandparents,m y birthplace,everything was 
new. W ehad a couple of  advantages.W e didn't speak Yiddish, we didn'thave a Yiddish 

accent, so we couldn'tgive ourselves awa y.  W ehad every single pi ece of paper we ha
d  to  
throw awa y.  Of  course nothing, zero.  And ofcourse, you know, m y m other
 
--
 
m y mo t he r's  
Polish was ver y good and so was m ine.  Becauseof  that she went to Polish school.  And in

Poland that was very i m portant because they couldtell by the accent.  So the threeof  us,we 
went on this train to Jaroslav.  Hopef ully
 
--
 
as I said I don't know wh y that town. W e said 
good
-
bye to ourf riends, and we
 
--
 
we were going to be on the trainforf ourdays andf our 
nights with changes, so m y mother hadm e by the hand carryin g m y sister and the two 

suitcasesand that's how we went onthetrain.  And said good
-
bye to them . And we started 
traveling, and as we started traveling, you know how it is on a train. People start talking to 

you.  Soa young manattached him self  to us, started chatting with m y m other.  Slowl y, slowl y 

startedasking questions.  Eventually m y m other saidtom e you know he pushedm e so hard 

thatI could not withstand itanym orebecause he wanted to know connections. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shetold you this af ter thewar?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, no, no, she toldm ethen.  She always toldm eeverything.  I 
wa s
 
--
 
I had to know in order to be able to, you know, be a support to her. So she said, you 
know, I could not take the pressure anym orebecause he thought maybe m y grandfather, you 

know
 
--
 
he was suspecting andas far as Hitler was concerned, if  your great great grandfather 
was Jewish that was enough.  So she said I told him  we were Jewis h and that the point hesaid 

well, you know, I'm  going to Jaroslav as well I'm  going toa com pany and he saidI have to 

hand you over to theGestapo. She said sheknew.  Shetoldm e that. W e started traveling 

together. And she thought, what to do. W hat todo.T here was nothing to do.  You know,he 

was ver y clever and thought thatI was going to run.  But, you know, keeping either oneor the 

other girl in his sights. But I mean we just traveled together.  And toJaroslav. W e were 

com pletely exhausted. W e had
 
--
 
in the hair we had
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Lice.
 
>> H a l i
na Peabody:  Lice, yes, sorry. W ehad lice everywhere, we were exhausted.  
W ehad to change trains, you know.  Andm y m other was still thinking and thinking andnot 

com ing up with nothing becausethere was nothing.  But when we cam e close to Jaroslav, 

wh e
n we started getting off the trainI suddenly woke up andI swear, I wasn't thinking at all.  
T hrough the train because I was sotired but I started walking down the steps, was just 

suddenly, you know, I said oh,m y God, I don't want to die. And I start pulling atm y m other.  

Mom , I don't want to die.  Idon't want to die. Som y m other turnedto him and she said, you 

know, wh y don't you let her go. She's blond. Maybe she can, you know, survive.  And I said 

no, I saidI don't want to go without you, no, no, no. So we continuewalkin g toward Gestapo.  

And so she askedhim
 
--
 
well, f irst of all, she asked him  to do usonefavor, that when we get to 
the Gestapo she'll give  him  our suitcasesand them oney and even the coats that we hadon 

our backs if  he prom ises one thing, that he'sgoing to have us shot im mediately, quickl y, 

because she didn't want to be separatedf rom  the children and she knew the suff ering that it 

was going to cause and she knew the end would be that we would be killed anyway.  So he 

prom
ised and she gave him the ticketsf or the suitcases and whatever m oney she had.  And as 
we were walkin g she is still thinking and she asked him  if hehad any children of  hisown.  And 

he said yes, he did. So she said sort of tohim , look, you know, I gave
 
you ever ything. W hy 
don't you
 
--
 
why do you want uson your conscious.  Just let us goandtry our luck.  And 
som ething happened to him.  He
 
--
 
you know, he got touched andhe
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shem entioned theone thing that was im portant to him ,his children.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  His children andhis conscience. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shewas sm art.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  He said youdon't have a chance.  In Polish itsounds better.
 
( 
speaking Polish
 )

Meansf rom  the rain underneath but inEnglish I would say you don't have a chance.  
Anyway, but heturnedaround andhe left. So there we were, just the three of us. And inthe 
m iddle of a strange town and we're walking on them ain road andm y m other's carrying m y 

sister.  She sees a little cafe and we walked
 
into the caf e.  Sheasked f or a littlem ilkf orm y 
sister and startsasking people around if  they have any placesthat they would take lodgers 

because we needed to be inside. Thepapers, we knew that we hadpapers but we didn't know 

if  they were good.  Nocom puter so they couldn't, you know, do it like that. But still, shedidn't 

want to be exam ined. And so som e young man gotup,took us, said he was going to take us 

to a lady, a washer wom an who would
 
--
 
who  took lodgers andm aybe she could takeus. S
o 
he walked usover there and as I saidf ull of lice, exhausted, justat the endof our (inaudible) 

so to speak.  Andthis little lady comes
 
--
 
youknow A ver y little lady.  She was a washer 
wom an and she was standing there looking at us and she said that she'll take us. And her 

strappingf our sons, you know, she had these strappingfour sons, they said no, no, no, no, 

don'ttake her.  Don't take her.  I mean, the way we looked, I'm  not surprised. But she saidoh, 

no,no, she said,this is a mother and two children. I have to take her. W onderful Christian 

lady. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you have a sense thefour sons suspected anything?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, we were strangers, we looked strange. W e were all dirty and 
exhausted and she had people who were
 
working, you know.  But she understood that there 
were children. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  You know, that's why she took us.  And shem ade very sure thatI 
was brought up in theCatholicfaith there.  As long as I lived there. And whether she 

suspectedor not, Idon't know. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you sort of  learned Catholic ritualf rom  her.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Ionly knew how
 
--
 
that I have to cross m yself  going in and out of 
church with m y right hand.  But the lucky thing was there that
 
Polish childrenhad school two 
hours a day and oneof our
 
--
 
the hours was Catholic
 
--
 
was Catholic.  You know, was religio n.  
T here was a very nice priest teaching the religion andbecause I knew how to read, then I 

could
 
--
 
the catechism was what they gave us all.  And therefore I could read up quickly and 
catchupa littlebit andI was a kid.  I mean, Iwas young. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  So I guessand soI went to schooland m y mother said she was 
going tof ind, you know, some
 
--
 
som e work because she had nom oney, nothing onher. And 
she went and lookedfor jobs. Thenext dayshe changedafew jobs like house keeper job and 

food was ver y scarce for thepoles as well sowe kids used to go to (inaudible) and steal a little 

bit and
 
we used to stealf rom the f arm ers who used to bring it inand they had to bring a certain 
contingent.  Andonce they were weighed in, they didn't care. So we'd jump in the backof the 

carts and we'd grab potatoes, carrots, whatever was available.  Mostly
 
we had
 
--
 
f or som e 
reason we had this terrible
 
--
 
not rice but. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Barley.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Barley, yes, which I can't stand. I'm  sure I went hungry a f ew 
days.  I can't
 
--
 
I never like barley, even before the war. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Is it1942 that we're talking now?  This is about 1942that you 
g u ys
 
--
 
that you as afam ily arri ve in Jaroslav?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Idon't know thedate. 
 

10
 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Approxim ately how long are you there?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  You see, I don't do thatbe
cau se  I 'm
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You were too young to remem ber probably.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Iwasn't paying attention.  You can go back and check. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  But you 
--
 
it was forf airly long, longer than a year, probably two years, 
r i gh t ?
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  I'm  sure, yes, yes.  Becausem y m other kept lookingf or ways to 
im prove our standing.  She was very wor ried about the security andsom ebody might 
recognize us becausem y sister had very curl y hair which in Poland is a sign of  Jewish. 
 
>> 
Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Because nowadays it'snot likethat, but in those days, Polish girls 
had straight blondhair.  Mine were blond andwa vy so they couldbraid it.  But inher case it 

was an Af ro. She still has an Af ro.
 
(Laughter). 
 
>
> Suzy Snyder:  Your m om found work.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  So shefound various jobs and then shedecided thatm aybe we 
could go to work in Germany.  Maybe that would be safer because the Germ ans not as good in 

recognizing poles, Jewish Pols that is, but they wouldn't take it because m y sister was too 

young.  So she decided to take a chance to apply to the Germ an m ilitary camp
 
--
 
you have the 
picture there
 
--
 
for a job because shefelt if she had an I.D. card, if they stopped her in the 
street or anything
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shewould have proof.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Exactl y.  Sheapplied. W e waited quite afew weeks for them  to 
supposedly check the papers but we didn't know if  we were going to live or die again.  But it 

cam e through.  So she got this job doing potatoes. And in themeantim e, you know, I was the 

only one,as I said, being brought up properly in the Catholic religion.  I went to comm union 

classes and comm union.  My sister was ver y young, so she was notinvol ved.  We hadone 

comm unication f rom  o
urf riendsbefore they passed away, bef orethey were killed, through the 
Red Cross cam ea letterfrom m yf ather thathe was saf e with his sister in Palestine.  In those 

days it was all under the Britishm andate. And som y father
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  So Palestine is what
 
--
 
what we know as Israel today.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Israel today, yes.  And we knew that his sisterhadm ade 
(inaudible)m eaning she went to work in Palestine inthe 1930s. Sothe wholefam ily was 

there. W e never m et that part of the fam
ily. And we didn't know exactly where they were, but 
we knew that meant he was outof  Russia.  Because it didn'tdous any good at thetim e.  As 

long as the Germ answere there we couldn't get into contact with him . 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t, you were stuck.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Of  course, of  course.  But we had hope that if  it ever ends, we had 
no idea what was going on in the world. W ehadno idea whattheGerm ans were doing,where 

thef ront was. W ehad nothing atall. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat was your daily
 
lif e like during this tim e period?  You said that 
you were def initely catechism  was apartof  your life.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, absolutely. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder: W ere you going to school?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Pardon? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You were going to school
? 

11
 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. W ell, we had the two hours a day.  And thenI workedfor a 
neighbor who had some Germ an blood inhim so m y motherf elt it was goodto work.  Notfor 
m oney but just
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  T o keep busy.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Exactl y. 
 
Andm y m other was alwa ys looking f or som ething better, 
you know, just in case.  In themeantim e theGerm ans were looking for one of our host's son 

who was kil ling pigs f or a living, which was a death penalty again. The Pols were not allowed 

to do thateither. Andonenight they cam e storm ing in them iddle of thenight with
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Machine guns?
 
>> Halina Peabody
:  
--
 
guns drawn and aroused everybody out,everybody out, so we 
cam e out. And m y mother cam e out with theI.D.  Oh, no, he said you stay, you stay.  And 

then took the restof  the f amily to the station. They took them and they all cam ebackthe next 

m orning. They were just checking if  they wer e working.  T hat was their thing. The Pols, they 

hadtobe working.  But it was oneof  those things that you could, you know
 
--
 
there was alwa ys 
a possibility they m ight catch you. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So there really was no chance to ever really relax.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, no. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You were always on guard.
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  Absolutely, you were.  Im ean, youhad tobe caref ul what you 
said.  My sister was ve ry happy she didn't know a thing. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Sometim es ignorance is bliss, right?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So in 19
 
--
 
July 1944
 
Poland is liberatedbut whathappens?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, inthe meantim e it's not liberated yet because you seeone 
m orning we wake up and there's complete silenceonthe roads. W e don't know what's 

happening.  Usually the cars go back andforth on the main road.W e don't know what's 

happening. As I said, we didn't know what the situation was atthefront. And suddenly there 

is the white black bomb and thebom bover the house. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hey were carpet bombing.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.  It was just the one. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Justone bomb.
 
>> Halina Peabody: The one bom b, yes.  And that's what hitm y hand.  My m other 
grabs m eand m y sister and we walk to the hospital. And there shelearns that the Russians 

are com ing. T hey're not there
 
ye t. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So ithit the home you were living in.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  Right in them iddle.  It was a house withthree kind of 
separated areas. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andyou were wounded.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  And I was wounded, yeah.  I went to thehospital and spenttwo 
m onths there.  In them eantim e they say the Russians are com ing,so we know that they are 

going to sort of not kill us this tim e. T hat's where we end.  Idon't know whether you wantm e 

to continue. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I do. W e
 
have time andI really wanted to
 
--
 
f irst, Iwanted to ask a 
question about the
 
--
 
your landlady.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, yes, of  course. W hen m y mother went back to theplace she 
found out that the lovely lady was under the roof of  the
 
--
 
in the kitchen, they killed her.  And 

12
 
 
we kind of  walked over there when, you know
 
--
 
when the bom b fell. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So she didn't survi ve.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She did not survive unfortunately, no. Theneighbor had to take 
m y m other and sister.  There was nothing there to salvage apparently at all.  W e hadnothing 
really.  And well, m y mother start knitting a little bit just toearna little bit so she could sendout 

questions who couldf indm y f ather. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W hich sheeventu
a lly d id .  
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Even though there was notInternet, it'samazing how peoplefound 
each other.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Radioandpapers. Sheputa noteonthe radio and apparently a 
f riend inTel Aviv and the lady who got that announcem ent recognizedm y f ather.  She knew 

h im .  
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  How long did it takebeforeyou were reunitedaf ter the war?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  About
 
--
 
well, a year before we m anaged to get some 
comm unication.  But then it tooka little longer. W ef ound out thathe was part of  thePolish 

unit that camef rom  Russia with the
 
--
 
with Stalin's okay because everybody tells m e you don't 
escape f rom  Russia.  W ell, the fact is he didn't escape exactly because he joined this Polish 

unit because they needed m en on the ground.  So Stalin and Roosevelt and Churchill agreed 

in letting the guys out. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W asthis Anders' Arm y?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Anders' Arm y.  Can andAnders was kind.  He ref used to take the 
m en, he tookfam ilies. Actually m y aunt anduncle came andm y cousin cam eas well.  And m y 

father stayed inthe Army as a dentist.  Andhe was stationed in Egypt.  Butof  course we didn't 

know any of that.  He did not com ehim self toget us out.  He sentmy cousin. Who was in the 

British Arm y. T hey were always in t wo places. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm e gobackand do a little chronology.  July of '44 you
 
--
 
the town 
you were in is liberated butthe war doesn't endf or another year.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's where
 
--
 
the Russians (inaudible) anyway. 
 
>>
 
Suzy Snyder:  Andyou stay in Poland.  
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e had no choice.  My m other said thattheyare not leaving. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder: W hat was it like for you asa Jew
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Iwasn't a Jew yet.  I couldn't say I was Jew b ecause
 
--
  
>
> Suzy Snyder:  So your mother saidto you
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m other said you can't because there was apogrom andthe 
few that cam e out of hiding were killed by thePols.  Andthe lady wh o kept us said that Hitler 

didn'tf inish his job.  So we had to keep this up until we got to Krakow.  And thenm y cousin put 

us in touch with a Jewi sh agency and they
 
--
 
again, we couldn'tf indlodging and again we had 
to continue with the charadeand it was not until we got into the group of people being taken 

out.
  
T his was a sem i perm itsf rom  the Russians. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Even in abigger town, a bigger city l ike Krakow yo u still couldn't
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  It wasn't Krakow, it was the suburbs. T hat's what it was. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  But your mother still did
n't feel comf ortable
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, it wasn't that.  Shewas asked directly. 
 

>> Suzy Snyder:  So you kept up this charade. T henthe war ends in April of 19
 
--
 
we ll,  
May of  1945 essentially.  T he war is over.
 

13
 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  But the Russians are there. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Okay.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  And the Russians,as I said, allow you some Jews to comeout.  
T hey take us and (inaudible) and then they put us into the German side. W e take trainto 
Berlin so we were in Berlin. T hen we endedup inthe (inaudible). And we didn't spend much 

tim e. My f atherf inally connects with us. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm eagain clarif y you're in adisplaced persons camp where people 
who survi ve the Holocaust endedup congregating in thesedisplaced persons cam
p.
 
>> C o r r e c t .  
 

>> Suzy Snyder:  Because they couldn't go hom e.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right.  Nobody 
--
  

>> Suzy Snyder:  T here was no 
--
 
nothing theref or them.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m othernever tried. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shewas done with Poland.  
 

>> H a l i
na Peabody: W ehad nofam ily in Zaleszc zyki. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You didn'tm ention grandparents, aunts, uncles.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Okay.  My both sidesof  the grandparents were in Krakow.  My 
grandfather had a heart attack in1939 and was buried bef oreth
e Ge r m an s  c am e .  M y 

grandm other, we thought she was in Auschwitz but, you know, the
 
--
 
our librarianfound that 
she was not taken inthe first round. He's stilllookingf or her. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shedidn't survi ve but you don't have inf orm ation.
 
>> Ha lin
a Peabody:  No, she didn't.  No. But, you know, I saidhow sad it was she has 
four
 
--
 
shehadf our children and there was nobody theref orher.  Nobody.  Yeah. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So extendedfam ily didn't survi ve.
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  No.  My oneaunt survived in Russia. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andso you are
 
--
 
were reunited with yourf ather eventually.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Eventually.  My sister thinks she's Catholic.
 
(Laughter). 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat did youdo
 
--
 
how did
 
that work?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, she
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andwhat did shef ind out,how did shef indout she was Jewish?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  She lookedatm y cousin and she said, you know, you're a nice 
m an but you're Jewish. 
 
( Laughter ) 
 
So it too
ka  little  tim e. B u t. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I would say.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She said that she toldme much later on thatpeople were asking 
her that, you know, you can tell us now, right?  And she said look at m e.  Do I have horns?  Do 

I have atail? 
 
>> S u z
y Snyder:  You know, I think shem usthave
 
--
 
she was exposed to us.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I have a 6
-
year
-
old child.  You don'tpick up thaton your own or 
5 -
year
-
old child.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah, of coursenot. 
 
>> S u z y S
nyder:  So you return
 
--
 
you were reunited.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  So because m yf ather was partof thePolishunit and part of  the 

14
 
 
British Arm y, we had the right to gotoEngland. And that's why ver y quickly t wo m onths af ter 
the camp we were rushedoff to England.  And that's where I grew up. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andyou have a quirky story about your Olym pic
 
--
 
you becam e a 
table tennis person.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, because I was so f rustrated not knowing the language,not 
knowing the people, and a
 
--
 
I  wa
ntedtoplay tennis.  It wasn't a swim mer.  I liked playing 
tennis.  Nofacilities, but table tennis was everywhere, so I picked up table tennis.  And I'm a 

pretty good hitter at that. And I hit and Ihit. And I really took outa lot of aggravation and a
ls o  
it was goodf or socializing.  You know, we didn't have health like they have here, social
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Social workers?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Social workers so this was m y actual cure.  SoI played a lot. I 
found out that when we got the house in
 
London, we
 
--
 
there was aJewish youth club called 
Macaabiah Club and the Maccabiah Clubs are all over the world.  It's for Jewish youth.  Once 

Israel was established, they started having the what we call the Jewi sh Olympics, the 

Maccabiah gam es every four years.  It'sthe sam e thing but justf orthe Jewish youth. Andso 

because I played so much I got goodat itand they sent me to Israelto represent England and 

I was ver y happy to
 
--
 
for thef irst time to see Israel.  Im eetm y fam ily, m y new f am ily.  I
t  wa s  
just a wonderful thing.  I think that did morefor m y spirits after the war. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So you
 
--
 
you stayed inEngland.  Youm arriedaHolocaust survi vor, 
yeah?
 
>> Halina Peabody: That was already in Israel. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  In Israel.
 
>> H
alina Peabody:  Istayed in England. I went in 1953, I went to Israel toplay the 
Maccabiah gam es.  Met everybody, and would have liked to have stayed longer but m y mother 

wasn't well so I knew I had to goback. Andm y m other unf ortunately passed away 19
56.  In 

1956 there was another Maccabiah gam es.  Iwent again.  And this tim eI saidI'd stay a year.  

But itendedup11.  And I endedup working for theAmericanEmbassy in T el Aviv.  T hat'swh y 

I'm  here. Because, you know, everybody wil l  ride in the cl
ass here but m em ories, everybody 
hada dream to com e to the United States.  Inever thought about com ing to the United States.  

But it just sohappened that Im et
 
--
 
m et m y husband who was a Holocaust survi vor as well .  
W ecame herefor a year in 1968and 
tha t wa s
 
--
 
that's 1968 I'm  still here.
 
(Laughter)
 
And I've just
 
--
 
when I retired I looked for some place where I could volunteer and I 
found wonderful place here at them useum  and that's where I'll stay.  I'm not leaving. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hat's good,because themuseum  needs you. W hen did yourf ather 
pass away?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  He passedaway
 
--
 
oh, boy.  You're asking m e
 
--
 
dates are very 
hardfor me. Buthe was 83, that's
 
--
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Much later than your mother.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes,
 
he
 
--
  
>> Suzy Snyder:  Your m other,how old was she?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m other was only 47. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Shewas 47, okay.  So shewas reall y young.  It must have been 
devastating to loseher at such a young age.  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She'sm y h
ero. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  She is your hero.
 

15
 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> >> Su zy Snyder:  But Ialways think what
 
--
 
what's so interesting to me is that 
wom en are so strong,have sucha strong
 
--
 
they play such a strong im portant role during this 
tim e period 
and when I readher story and read through your notes, the notes that you've 
written about her, youknow, I always think she really m u been tough.  A tough person.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, she said sports develops courage.  Andshe was
 
--
 
you 
know, she jum pedf rom  the highest place when she was swim m ing.  She jum ped on skis. She 

danced on skates. She was
 
--
 
she was absolutely fearless. She rode horses.  Imean, 
any
 
--
 
any kind of  sports that you mention, she would do.  But her main thing was the childre
n 
alwa ys.  And I justfeelalways ver y sad when I thinkthat she didn't see any grandchildrenand 

didn't live long enough. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  But I feel that she would bepleased with her two daughters who, 
you know, did the nice
 
--
 
who did nice. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W here did Eva live?
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Eva li ved in London with herf our kidsandthree grandkidsand of  
course I visit every year. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So at this pointI think we have tim efor questions.  So let meopen i
t 
upfor questions.  Yes. 
 
>> Ho w did your m other die? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Letm e repeat the question.  So the m ic goes around, how did your 
m other die?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m otherhad the recurrence of cancer. Shehad the first cancer 
operation in Poland, I thinkf rom  theawf ul thing that shefeltaboutm y hand being wounded, 

she had to
 
--
 
that waswhen she hadthefirstoperation.T hey wouldn't even show it was 
cancer but she said to m e we don't want you to be orphan so let herhave the operation.  So 

s
he hadbreast cancer.  And som ehow shemanagedto survi ve tenyears.  In England they 

didn'thave the right machine early to check and unf ortunately she passed away. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Yes.  Right here. 
 
>> M y son wants
 
--
 
oh.  My son wants to know if you m et any German Nazis that 
questioned your religion.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.  I
 
--
 
there were no questionsf or childrenabout religion, asfar 
as I know.  I mean, Itried not to ever give them  any reasonto suspect anything, no.  No.  I 

never have done that.
  
But I would have answered just like a Catholic person.  I wentto
 
--
 
you 
know, I went toall the rituals and everything, but I was pretty well or ganized there. Yeah. 
 
>> >> Su zy Snyder:  Yes, right here. 
 
>> Does your sister practice Judaism  or Christia
n i t y?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She is Jewish.  She's been to Israel. W e did the (inaudible) which 
is a year service in Israel. W hen she lef t shewas Jewish she understood more or less 

becam e quite comf ortable with that.  It was not
 
--
 
we li ved in England where, you know, Jews 
were not that treated badly like they were in Poland.  So yeah, she'sbeen back to Israel. Very 

m uch so. But we were  never ver y religious so it wasn't adiff icult thing.  And whenm y m other 

worr ied aboutm e maybe looking forward to being Catholic, sheexplained to me that we all 

pray to the sam eGodbut throughdiff erent religions.  And she saidand you're Jewish, that was 

it.  So it was ver y sim ple form e.  Inever hadany conf licts. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Did you have a hard tim e giving up Catholicism  after the war?
 

16
 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.
 
(Laughter)
 
No, no, Im ean,I liked the religion very m uchbut I understoodthat this was one of the 
religions thatpeople believe in and thatm ine was Jewish.  I didn'thave any knowledge about 
the Jewish religion butit didn'tmatter. My m other's explanation wasenough because she also 

toldm e that Jews, we get persecuted muchm orethan the Catholics butthat's who we are.  So 

yeah. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Questions? More questions? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  A ques
tion over there. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T here's a questionall the way until the back. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: There's a young m an there that wants to talk. 
 
>> First of  all,thank you f or being here.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  You're welcom e.
 
>> Ho w concerned are you that we m ay beageneration or two away f rom peopleeither 
notbelieving the Holocaustoccurredor downplaying it in som e way? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So how concerned are youthat we're a generation or two away f rom  
people not believing the Holocaust?
 
>> Ha lin a  P
eabody: W ell, Iam very concernedabout it. T hat's why I'm  here and that's 
wh y, you know, this museum  is so very, ver y im portanttous Jews, survi vors.  Because we 

want to make sure that people know, this is not the only thing you have to remem berabout 
t h e 

Jews.  I m ean, we hada very
 
--
 
we have a very rich history.  T his iswhat happened to us in 
this time, but we have been persecutedbef ore and we have other also attributesthat we need 

to be rem em beredfor. And thism useum  is what we are giving ever ything to holdfor us.  You 

know, we're not interested in making people suff er orm aking them  sad,but we want to war n 

them f orthef uture that, you know, try to prevent this happening. That's why we're here.  And 

that's why Holocaust rem embers is so im por
tant.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Yes, right here.
 
>> I kind of have two questions.  But whatdoyou think you would have done if your 
m om  or your sisterhad been found and whatdo you think they woul d have done if  you were 

found? 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You m ean if  they were discovered by the Nazis.
 
>> Yeah.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, if  we had been discovered by the Nazis we would have all 
been takenaway.  M y
 
--
 
the children usually would get killed imm ediately because they had no 
usefor children.  My m otherm ight have survi ved as slave laborbutshe did not want to 

survi ve.  So that's why when she
 
--
 
she decided that if we were caught we should allbe shot 
together. Because she did not want to live without the children. T hat's what mom s are like, 

you know.  Yeah. 
 
>> 
Suzy Snyder:  Any other questions?  Okay.  I think what I'm  going to ask is that, you 
know, we al ways gi ve you the last word, Halina.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, Im ore or less said afew last words.  I'm really doing this 
eyewitness account because f irst of
 
all, I want to honor m y m other, the six m illion who 
perished, andalso becauseIf eel that youneed to know what happened because as you 

m entioned sometimespeople say it hadn't happened.  I wish it didn't but you know it did and 

t h is  mu s e um  is f u ll of th
ings to prove to you that ithashappened. And I just want som uchf or 
m y children and grandchildren to be safer.  And I just prayf or that. So that'sm y reasonf or 

17
 
 
being here, and I thank you ver y m uchfor com ing and listening to us.  And Ihope thatth
is  wi ll 
rem ain with you also. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hank you so much.
 
(Applause).
 
As Im entionedbef oreyou all leave, if you could stayf or onem oment so we could take 
a picture of  Halina. Thank you so much.
