we Œ we belonged to  synagogue, and we ne

uld Œ would deal with
 kosher markets.

urban, or was it mo re, perhap s sheltered 
and quiet? Or how would you Œ overall, 
how would you descri
be your childhood? 
A: Normal. I had friends, and th rough school

normal way. As I said though, but I was 
always helping my  Œ my  parent earn a 
living, and so I got thro ugh. No thing Œ no
thing outstanding, it™s just a normal Œ a 
normal life. 

Q: I™m curious about the ballgames. How di
d they end up? Did Œ did Œ did Œ did the 
Jews and the Gentiles sort of split the wins 
and the losses more or less evenly, or di

Washington
, 
D
.
C
. area, or did you have a 
large geographic area that yo
u were responsible for? 
A: This is when I was living in south 
Baltimore
. We had some customers in Œ in 
the area, the north Œ northwest 
Baltimore
, but I recall I would go to the eastern 
shore, and there were stores in eastern 
Mary land

Germany
 and throughout 
Europe
 were specifically being 
targeted for harassmen t and violence? Did you
 know before going in the service, or 
did you know ab  Œ when did th

Q: Okay . 
A: I don™t Œ 

Q: Let™s go back to conscription. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were you given the opt
ion of the European or 
Pacific
 theater? 
A: Well, let™s Œ first of all, I was drafte
d into elev Œ a Œ a 
new organization called 
11
th
 armo red division. And we originated in  
Louisiana
. I was in the 42
nd
 tank 
battalion of the 11
th
 armo red division, and I trained as a tanker. An d because of my  
written tests that I took, plus the Œ the tr
aining I got, I was Œ I Œ I Œ I cou Œ I could 

have become a Œ an officer. At th at time 
I have ant-anti-Semitis
m in the service, 
specifically  in Œ in the area that I was 
training as a tanker. And I had some anti-

Semitinism
(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an  opportunity to go to 
headquarters of 42
nd
 tank battalion, and so that™s wh
at I did. And I became assistant 
to the adjutant there. And th
en, of course, we went overs
eas, and I went on Œ and as 
I was Œ I was Œ I was transferred to the Œ 
th e headquarters as a clerk typist, and so 

that was my title, alth ough I didn™t Œ when 
we went overseas, I 
didn™t do any typing 
or anything. I w Œ I was the assistant to 
the adjutant and of course the battalion 
commander gave instructions Œ wanted inst
ructions to the Œ the adju tant. And of 
course, my  being the noncom, I did 
the Œ whatever had to be done.

Q: Let™s go back to the Œ 
the na Œ the anti-Semitism that
 you experienced inside the 
army. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Talk about that, the nature of it. How 
did you feel it, how were you exposed to 
it? 
A: Well, what happened was, a Œ a incident
, for example, during the growing of th Œ 
of the Œ of the division, of the comp any,
 the battalions. People were transferring in 
and out, and there was a Œ a Jewish soldier, 
Weinberg
(ph), that transferred out, and 
the Œ several of Œ of the soldiers said good, 
we got rid of another Jew. At that point I 
said, I™m Jewish. They couldn™
t understand. I didn™t look
 Jewish, my name wasn™t 
Jewish. And I says, well, you didn™t Œ you 
don™t see the horns coming out? At any 
rate, I Œ I had a different f
eeling with Œ with these sold
iers, who were part of my 
tank Œ tank comp any. And so 
I didn™t feel comfortable going to officer training, 
coming back, and dealing w
ith Œ with anti-Semites in
 my outfit, fighting the 
Germans. So, that was Œ that was why I tr ansferred to the company. And course we 

didn™t have any Œ I didn™t 
have to deal with any anti-
Semitism while in the battalion 
headquarters. So that was Œ th
at was the experience I had. 
Q: Okay. Do you recall when and ho
w you received your call-up notice? Where 
were you, how did you receive it?

A: I was in 
Baltimore
 on my  21
st
 birthday. As I said, I w a
s working for this jobber, 
and I got notice that I Œ I™m in
 Œ I™m drafted into the army . 
Q: How did you feel about that? 
A: I took it in stride. I knew 
I had to go, and so I had Œ 
Q: Where did you first go to traini
ng? Where was your initial training? 
A: In 
Lo uisia na
. 
Q: What was it like? 
A: Camp 
Polk
. 
Q: What was it like? 
A: Well, course it™s all new. As I said, I 
was in a tank battalion and I was in the Œ I 
was in 
C
 company, if I recall. And trained w
ith others, learning all about tanks, and 
the armaments, and I was an expert with Œ with  a submachine gun. Go t a medal 

there, and I learned the 75 millimeter cannon. And I also trained, or learned the .45 

pistol. And I learned my  Œ I l
earned the armaments very well. 
Q: Was it difficult? 

A: No, it™s Œ it™s practice, a lot of time.

lenge, a mental challenge, or Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. Certainly well enough to 
be solicited for officer training. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So. 
A: But I turned that
 down, as I said. 
Q: Right. 

A: Cause I didn™t feel comfortable if I 
came back as an o
fficer. Although I recall 
there was a Jewish officer that was in one
 of the comp an ies, and I don™t recall many 
Jewish soldiers aft er that.  

Q: How did you cross over to 
Euro pe
, by boat?

 for quite a time. 
Q: What were you doing 
th ere, training and Œ 
A: We were training, yes.

A: I had no problems with them. If I recall,
 I even Œ I even dated a Œ a Jewish girl, 
and invited to Œ invited to the home, and Œ 
but that wasn™t anything mo re. And then, 
of course, we went over to 
France
. Let™s see. On December 16, 1944, the Germans 
lonc Œ lanced a Œ a counterattack 50 mile radius in the 
Ardennes
. And let™s see Œ 
okay, and then when  Œ wh-when we went into  
France
, our first assignment was to 
guard  the Œ hold the section of the 
Moose
 River, where the German attack was 
expected, but on the t Œ th

German lines, and we leave

They brought back an 
SS
 officer to our headquarte
rs, and Œ and understanding 
Yiddish, I attempted to interrogate him,
 but I wasn™t too successful with the 
German, so they brought over
 interpreters from headquar
ters that took over, and Œ 
and Œ and interviewed Œ inter Œ interr
ogated him. I noticed the captain of 
D
 
comp any was angered with the discovery  of 
th e American dead  bodies, and he took 
some prisoners, lined them a Œ on the wall,
 and killed them. And I recall that I Œ  I 
had to take the bodies and put them in Œ in bags. 
Q: Did Œ i Œ wh at was upsetting to  comma
nd and staff about the American bodies? 
Was it the nature? Did they appear
 to have been executed , or Œ 
A: What?

e Œ the-the bodies, the American bodies. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And that upset people. 

A: Yes.

 an Œ of a Œ of a comb at engagement, or 
did they  appear to have been
 captured and then executed?  
A: That™s wa Œ wa Œ they Œ 
they  captured and executed .

Q: Including yourself. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right. So you saw both the Americans, 
and th en the subseque
nt round-up of the 
Germans as well. 

A: Oh, of course. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Yes. Of course, our line companies di
d the Œ you know, captured the Germans 
and so fo rth. I was in headquarters Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ and so I wasn™t directly Œ although 
Œ although once Œ once we captured the Œ 
the soldiers is Œ I was

 who were responsib le for the execution 
of the Americans?

Jewish, and he thought maybe I had a Œ a

in speaking German,

which I wasn™t. So, I Œ I Œ I can™t tell you ho
w I felt at the time. I think things lead 
up to  wh at happens, and you take it as a 
matter of stride, I Œ I ge Œ I think. 
Q: Would you say retrospectively, lo
oking back , wh en you™re there in 
Europe
, the 
war in on proper, you™re part of it. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you feel that your training up to th at
 point equipped you to deal with war? 

Did you feel as if you were prepared? 
A: Yes. Yes. As Œ as all the members of our division were. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. 
Q: What Œ did you form an 
opinion of the en emy? Were 
they good sold iers, sloppy 
soldiers, were they Œ 
A: Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha Œ we set up a camp. I recall 

that we had some German soldiers that we made 
KP
, and I-I-I was guarding Œ at 
one point I was Œ I was guard ing Œ I Œ I did 
a various Œ various things. But one Œ at 
one time I Œ I was guarding prisoners, I reca
ll telling this German that he wasn™t 
doing a good job of cleaning the large soup  vats, and he tried to Œ he says, I™m 
doing th e best I can. And Œ and that ended th
at conversation. Bu t I Œ I didn™t really 
have any direct contact, as such, with Œ w
ith Œ with the German 
soldiers, other than,

as I said, at one time I was there. O-Othe
r times I would Œ I would go into  a burnt 
out tank, and scrape the carcass from the 
inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn™t 
want to leave any s-soldiers behind, so Œ 
Q: So th ese were Americans that you had to  extract? 
A: These are Œ th-these are American, yeah
. On e of the tanks of Œ of one of our 
companies. So Œ 

Q: That had to have been
 extraordinarily traumatic. 
A: Yes. Yeah. Everything there was Œ it™s a Œ  
but we took things in stride. Soldiers 
did their job. We Œ we Œ we did well,
 and after Œ after we left bast Œ 
Bastogne
, we Œ 
we traveled south,
 and went thro ugh 
Luxembourg
, and then 
Germany
. 
Q: Were you engaging the en
emy as you™re going along? 

A: Oh yes, of course. We™re all fighting, as
 i Œ as i Œ as Œ as I remember, the main 
force of Germans were defeated in the 
Bastogne
 area, and of course there™s still 
plenty of fighting going on, and we ge Œ 
our Œ our division fought and engaged the 
enemies as we went down. And th
en wh en we got down to Œ near 
Austria
, as a Œ as 
I told you, General 
Patton
 was the T h ird  Army  co mma n d e
r, and Œ and instru ctions 
were that we weren™t supposed to go into 
Austria
. But 
Patton 
didn™t like Œ didn™t Œ 
didn™t like that, and so 
we went into austr Œ 
Austria  
also. And that™s where Œ okay, 
and as I said, the Russians were 
supposed to  take over the Œ
 Austria
, and Œ and

Patton
 didn™t like the Œ the Ru
ssians either. And so li 
Œ going down , one of our 
companies, one of the co
mp anies was making Œ was doing reconnaissance, and on 
the road Œ on a certa
in road, a German 
Jeep

coming towards them, a 
Œ with a white flag, 
and they  surrendered. And it turns out he 
was telling them of the Œ of the Œ of 
Mauthausen
, that i-it was Œ it was five miles 
back. And the reason they Œ they  
wanted Œ they Œ they  gave up to us, is 
they didn™t want the Ru ssians, because the 
Russians would Œ would Œ woul
d just kill them. And so that was how we learned of 
Œ of the concentration camp. The next mo rning, I went with the battalion 
commander and the ad jutant in
to the camp. That was my
 first seeing it. And of 
course, what I observed was piles of shoes,

so I Œ I don™t know, bu-but this is my 
memory, that I wrote a letter a

And of co urse our Œ our comp any Œ co mp
anies took them out, and we eventu ally 
took them back to headquarters. But as I said, I wa
s in the headquarters of the 
battalion, and I didn™t physically get involv
ed with Œ with the so
ldiers there. We Œ 
we had our other Œ you know, 
others that were doing it. 

Q: Once you and the battalion were inside 
the camp  proper, what did you have to 
do? Did you have to start gi
ving medical attention, did 
you start distributing fo od? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. 
We have a Œ a medical battalion with  us, 
and so th ey went in and did
