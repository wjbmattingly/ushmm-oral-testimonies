MICHAEL M. CERNEA 
 May 4, 2005 
 
Question: Good morning, Michael. 
Answer: Good morning.  

Q: It™s very nice to meet you and have you here. 

A: I™m glad to be here. 

Q: Good. Michael, what was your
 name  when you were born? 
A: It was Catz, is family name , Catz you pronoun
ce it, C-a-t-z, Moisei M-o-i-s-e-i, which was 
Moishe in terms of a Jewish name , but they -- it 
was a lucified name  of -- the variational form of 
Moishe or Moisei. In fact, by -- by the book, my 
name  is Moisei Catz. Moisei bar Mordechai 
Catz a coyen, of course. 

Q: So when did you become  Michael Cernea? 

A: That happened about 20 some  yea r s later. I cha
nge my na me . It ca me  first as a kind of prank, 
which we did as high school kids, a -- a 
bunch of us were -- you want the story? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: That happened in -- I 
believe in 1940 -- ™48 - ™49. 

Q: This is after the war? 

A: After the war, yes, when -- a b-bunch of fr
iends from our class was walking and we were 
walking town, and having a good time and we noticed there wa s an announcement about -- for a 

competition for sportswriters. The sport newspaper of Bucharest was trying to recr uit --  hire, 

identify sportswriters and opened a competition. So 
a few of us said why not
, let™s try. We were 
really kind of -- sensed that it™s not the best 
chance to give our name s -- in addition to real 
name s, and additionally didn™t know 
what the repercussion that have at school. So I invented the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
2 
 
name  and I took Cernea. And that kind of 
-- that was destiny kind of, I w -- I won the 
competition for the writing, then the -- the or al 
competition, I was offered the job. That changed 
a lot of things in my life, incl
uding the name . So this how -- 
Q: So that™s how the name  changed. 
A: -- I st ayed with the name for a number of year
s until after I married, we decided to change it 
in the documents as we ll, because I ma rried under 
the real name , but there 
was a lot of conflicts 
in -- in documents between the people calli
ng me  one way, the documents being different, 
having to explain ever
ything [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: -- so this is
 how it changed. 
Q: So your recollection as yourself
 as a child, especia
lly during the war period is as Moishe, or 
Mose -- Moise -- Moisei -- 

A: Well the dimi nutive name which my mother 
and everybody in the family used was Musi. 
Q: Musi. 

A: Musi, which is M-u-s-i, writte
n in Roma nian. The name  is not 
very frequent for me n, but it™s 
quite frequent for girls, whose variant, you 
know, fe mi nine variant 
of Musi is Musia. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So we can find a lot of wome n called Musia. 

Q: I see. 

A: But I was Musi and my good old friends, sinc
e high school and before, who are still alive, 
those are -- call me  Musi today. 

Q: Not Michael. 

A: Not Michael, no, no.

Q: No Michaels. And what was your date of birth? 
A: It was October 14, ‚31 

Q: 1931. 

A: 1931. 

Q: And you -- where were you born? 

A: In Balti. This is a famous town of the -- 
of the -- even more famous Yiddish song, Mein 

shtaitila Balti. 

Q: Right, it™s a great song. 

A: If you recall Mein shtaitila Balt
i, da, la, la, la, la, la, la, that
 song. It™s a beautiful song. It is 
spelled, if you need to know, B-a-l-t-i. It is
 in Bessarabia which at that time belonged to 
Roma nia. Then it passed. That is a territory betw
een the rive rs Prut and Dniester. And it change d 
state allegiance or ownership or belongingness al
-along the centuries. Wh en I was born it was 
part of Romania; in 1940 it was shifted back 
to Russia. And the Russi
an pronunciation of the 
town is Balti. Until 1917 - 1918, I think, the Russian revolution, it was part of Russia. So 

population there spoke Russian and the Jews sp
oke Yiddish, too, so my mother, who was born 
there and her fa mily spoke Russian and -- and Yiddi
sh. So they were all fluent in Russian and I 
learne d the Russian, a bit of Russi
an from my moth
er, too so -- 
Q: You did? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Now why were you born in Balti since your mother and father were living in Iasi? 

A: We ll Joan, you should know be
tter how young mothers feel a
nd behave. When my mother 
was pregnant, my father and mother lived in Ia
si, which was a big cit
y, apparently the second 
city of Romania at that time , over a hundred 
thousand people in the northeastern part of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
4 
 
Roma nia, close to the border with Bessarabi a. So
 Bessarabia was then part
 of Roma nia, and she 
decided to go to deliver in her mother™s house 
and be with the care of her mother, which was 
supposed to be even better than in
 the big hospital in Iasi. This is how I was born in Ba lti, yes. 
Q: And did you go back and forth to Balti a gr ea
t deal to see your grandparents, or  other 
relatives? 
A: As a ma tter of fact, not. I 
believe I have one recollection, 
I don™t know whether I was four 
years old or so, that I was in Balti and I reme mb
e r  being on my grandfather™s lap on the f -- front 
part of his house. That I reme mber very clear
ly, and was confirme d by my mother, and some  guy 
who was selling pickled apples, which was a specia
lty there, was passing by, 
and he -- I wanted 
and my grandfather stopped him and bought me the 
apple, which was very tasteful. I believe was 
the fi rst time in my life, and the last time. 

Q: And the last -- 

A: And the last time . I never he
ard again about pickled apples. 
Q: No, I™ve never heard [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, in Romanian they™re called mere mura
te, mere murate. And I still have the plan to 
identify whether some body knows how to do such things now. 

Q: So you can try it again, yes.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Let™s talk -- 

A: Yeah, but then I was again in Balti -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- that is the fullest ans -- 
fuller answer to your question. 
Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

A: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when that part, which in the meantime became the 
Soviet Republic of Muldavia, during Soviet ex
is -- Soviet Union existence, became now the 
independent country of the republic of Moldova. 
And I -- with the help of an assignment from 
the World Bank, where I was working [indecipherable]
 in the 90™s, I ma de my way back to that 
place. I took a few days off from
 my for mal mi ssion to go back to
 Balti. And this is when I 
visited Balti, I believe it was ™94 or ™95. And so 
th-the pl ace of my birth again, of course, totally 
changed and course the city was destroyed, the --
 ravaged during the war.
 But I was there, and 
the part which was not fully destroyed, still existe
d, was a ceme tery which I visited. So yes, I re -
- retrieved my place of birth.  

Q: And you were able to see the grave of
 your great-grandfathe
r, is that right? 
A: When I was -- that was one of ma  -- my pur
poses, to see the grave of
 my grandfather. And 
that time, one of my cousin and his family were 
still living in Balti in ™94, they lived there. They 
went during the war, we kind of 
skipped over time, but anyway, th
ey were, during the war put in 
camps, persecuted, some  of -- ma ny people in my fa mily died in that period, in camps, of -- were 

killed, or died of typhus and other diseases
, and -- in the camps. He was among those who 
survived. And after the war he went into the Ru
ssian army, when the army -- Russian army freed 
the people in the camp, and then even visited us 
in Roma nia. So we kept in touch with them 
during the war, and after the war, and now I had 
the chance, I went to see him and talked him 
into speaking up his own thoughts of leaving an
d moving to Israel. And indeed, two or three 
years later, they did move to Israel, and he passed 
away in Israel. But when I was in ™94, in Balti, 
he took me  -- he and his wife Tiupa, who is sti
ll alive -- his name  is Zi
oma  Faerstein. Both of 
them took me to the grave of my gra
ndfather. And I saw the grave, yes.  
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s talk a litt
le bit about your family. What was your father™s name ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

A: Marcu. 
Q: Marcu. 

A: Marcu, in fact, Marcu Leib Catz. 

Q: And that™s Leib, L-e-i-b. 

A: L-e-i-b, yes. 

Q: Yeah. And -- 

A: And Marcu you spell with a C. 

Q: C, right. And what did he do? 

A: He was trained as an engine
er . His t r ai ni ng was el ect ri c al  e
ngineering in Roma nia of course, 
but he was also -- got for a specialization and we
nt to France for a few months. But that -- the 
conditions were not very good in 
Roma nia for that specialty. Ro
ma nia was an agrarian country, 
basically. So he shifted his work
 to the textile industry and wo
rked as a engineer in textile 
industry, first for electrical engi
neering, but then he learned th
e ma ster -- the engineering of 
textile work. So that was basically
 his profession as long as he wa
s allowed to exercise it as a 
professional, after which he was eliminated. N
o, from a mong t he profession, he was fired, sorry, 
not eliminated, but had to become  a -- a me rchant of textiles. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, the Jews were allowed to be me rchants but not to be employed as professionals. 

Q: So was he employed in Iasi? 

A: Yes, in Iasi, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Until 1939 or 1940. 

Q: I was going to ask, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
7 
 
A: Yeah, when all the professional Jews were -- we
re, by law, fired from all places, so all of a 
sudden he became une mployed, as in fact I did, mo
re or less the same  time , although I was only 
what, eight, nine years old, because all the Jewish kids, by anot her law at the same  time, were 
expelled from all the state schools. 

Q: Yeah -- 

A: So -- 

Q: -- so you would -- you [indecipherable] 

A: -- we shared -- we shared fates, ye s. 

Q: T-Tell me  what you reme mber about life in 
your home be fore the war. What -- what do you 
reme mber about your father, do you -- were you close 
with your father, did he spend time  with 
you, or was that not typical at that time?  

A: No, no, my father was a very warm person, love
d me  very much. I was his first born, so he 
invested himself a lot in me . And I loved him, and 
course he was a constant presence in my life, 
so to say th -- spiritual presen
ce too, he gave me  my religious 
education when I was a child, and 
my intellectual education he contributed very mu
ch because he was an intellectual, too. And -- 
and my mother was also an intellect
ual, she was trained as a pharmacist. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. They both, in fact, me t in the university 
in Iasi, where they got 
to know -- came  to know 
each other, then got married. And my  mother was a pharmacist, she was well educated also in 

literature, which she love d, and was multilingual. 
Very bright  woman, an extraordinarily st rong 
presence in my life. And when I was unfortunate to 
lose my father in the late 60™s, after illness, 
which is due largel y to the to the pogro m in Ia
si, my mother lived until 
her -- close to her 90™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
8 
 
and she came to the St ates. I brought her to the St
ates, in fact, and we had a very good time here. 
And therefore, she -- her presence in 
my life lasted until just 14 years ago.  
Q: Wow, that™s fabulous. 
A: And it was a very presence -- a very strong pr
esence. I owe -- I owe a very great deal to my 
mother for all I have done and for the way I am. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: For my values, so it was a very tight family life. 
I have a brother, is -- th
at is part also of your 
question? 

Q: Yes. 

A: His name  is Zolly, Zolly Catz. His name  is -- 
the Jewish name  is Zoll man. And he is -- carries 
the name  of my grandfather of my
 mother™s side. Be -- I -- my na
me Moisei is -- Moisei is the 
name  of my great-grandfather,alsomy mother™s side. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So as you see, my mother ruled the -- 
Q: It™s very -- 

A: -- the name giving in the family. And she told me all --  all the stor ies I -- she remembered 

about her great -- her -- her 
grandfather was my grand -- 
Q: Uh-huh, your great-grandfather. 

A: -- greatfather, yes, Moisei Ba
raz. So that was my mother, and 
I was very fortunate to have in 
our home, in addition to my brother and my
 parents, my grandmothers, on both sides. 
Q: Both sides? 

A: On both sides, until late. I mean, my grandm
other on my father™s side, name d Eva - -  Chava 
was a s-strongest religious presence in
 the house, lived with us until the 1944. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

Q: Really. 
A: I knew also my grandfather on my  father™s sti 
-- side. His name  is Itic -- Itic. And he passed 
away when I was a child, but I reme mber him when 
they visited us, in a kind of cart with horses. 
I reme mber his very imposing -- bo
th my grandfathers were very 
imposing Jews, tall, both tall, 
with gray beards, with payas -- 

Q: Payas. 

A: -- yes. So they hard to forget. And then my
 parents spoke very ofte
n with great reverence 
about their parents, so I 
know a lot about that.  
Q: Right. 

A: It was a tight family, close family, and -- 
and you know, I inherited th
e -- the -- the devotion 
to the idea of fa mily from -- from my own parents™. 

Q: So you must have had a fairly large home if yo
u also had your two gran
dmothers there, or am 
I wrong?  
A: Well, we had a large home by Romanian standard
s. It would be a -- a 
-- a [indecipherable] or 
a tight home  by American standards -- 
Q: American stan -- 

A: -- yes. You know, is -- I slept with my brother in
 a room, or otherwise he sl -- I slept in the -- 
or he slept in the so-called living room which 
doubled o -- [indecipherable]
 living room, and in a 
corner had a bed for my -- one of
 my  grandmothers, so that -- 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: -- I don™t complain, it was a good family life, yeah. 

Q: It was a good fa mily life. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
10 
 
A: I wouldn™t say that my fa mily was among the 
poorest families, Je wish fa milies, no, because 
they were mi ddle class. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Middle class. 

Q: So you fe lt comfortable, not -- not deprived? 

A: No, until -- on a --  only after --  until my father was employed -- 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- then we  had periods, long periods when
 my father did not 
ma ke, you know, a salary. 
Q: Right.  

A: Had to improvise, and to expose hims elf to ve
ry risky activities to 
-- to bring something on 
the tabl e --  

Q: Ho me . 

A: Yes. 
Q: What was your mother™s name? 
A: Seindel. 

Q: It was her first name , Seindel? 

A: Sein -- Se indel, yes, Seindel, and her name  
is in Jewish, yeah Sei
ndel -- Shinya -- no, sorry, 
her Jewish name  is Seindel, her -- the name  
by which everybody knew her and called her was the 

Russian dimi nutive of Seindel, which was Shanya. 

Q: Shanya. 

A: Shanya, yes. 

Q: That™s very nice. 

A: Shanya. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
11 
 
Q: Was it an -- 
A: She -- she was pr -- very proud of her family name  as a girl, which was half a century before 

modern fe minist bent. And she always liked
 to call hersel f Sha
nya Faerstein Catz. 
Q: Catz. 

A: Yes. 

Q: That™s interest -- 

A: And this is what she wanted to be written on her gravestone and this is how I wrote on her 

gravestone. 

Q: Was it unusual for a woman to
 be so educated in Roma nia? 
A: Yes, it was unusual, it was not frequent. But 
she was bright, she wanted to get educated. Her 
father was really enamored by her, her mother. She was his only child of her mother, who was 

the second wife of my grandfathe
r. My grandfather had six child
ren for his first ma rriage, and 
then his wife  died, Chava died, and -- and he ma
rried my grandmother, Br
ana, who came from a 
-- a -- anot her little shtetl, Briceva, also there.
 Brana Baraz. And their only child was my mother, 
so it was a child, at old age you can imagine -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- how dear -- in fact, I have 
a -- a picture of my grandfather,
 imposing as he was, my -- my 
grandmother and my mother at the age of one
 year, where she looks
 like a doll, you know. 
Q: Right. And we™ll see th
at pi ctur e later, yes? 
A: As you wish, yes. 

Q: And in -- wh-when you reme mbe r  
back, in terms of your household. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
12 
 
Q: Wa s it a happy household, was ther
e a lot of discussion, were you 
involved with your parents 
and your grandparents? I mean how do you -- 
h-how do you picture it when you think -- 
A: Well, it was a -- 
Q: -- now I™m talking before the war, of course. 

A: -- yeah, it was a happy household obviously, 
but it was not -- it was a Jewish household 
where you would have a fight and you would 
have some  people screaming, and you have 
arguments. Was a whole hullabaloo, you know? I do reme mber arguments, too. I do reme mber 

my father getting upset and angry and you know, 
using strong words. He was a coyen and you 
know, the Kohanim are -- are tr
aditionally seen as
 people who are easily irritable. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh. 

A: You know, they have a short fuse. 
Q: Right. 
A: I™m a coyen, too. 

Q: So is that true of you, too?  Yes? 

A: We ll, I™ve -- you know, going 
through so ma ny cultures, I 
try to temper it -- that 
characteristic, but I wouldn™t say that I am alien to
 my heritage. So I inher
ited that too. But -- so 
it was a norma l household, Joan, nothing very speci
al, but an educated household where, you 
know, discussions were very often about politics, 
about broader issues and the daily life values. 
Sometimes philosophy, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
13 
 
A: -- issues, political  issues, tyrani sm, anti-S
emitism, a lot of discussi on the situation in 
Roma nia, the situation in Russia, whether Jews 
are doing better in Russia 
-- this was before the 
war -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- and during the war what -- 
you know, a lot of discussion. My 
mother was involved early in 
the Zionist move me nt. And she had connection th
ere, so the matter came 
up and she -- I recall 
that she would go to reunions of the Zi onist wome
n of Iasi at that time , and she came back and 
brought and spoke to me  about oranges who grow in
 Palestine. Yeah. And then sh -- they were 
also involved on the left of cente
r activities, like ma ny other Jews 
at that  time were in Romania, 
but particularly my mother, comi ng from Russia ha
d friends who were rea
lly enrolled in anti-
Fascist, an-and communist undergrou
nd, and they, in fact, used the 
friendship with my mother to 
ask her to give them shelter when they were pursued by the police. And -- and some  of them 

slept and came  and hid in our house and then disappear
ed as silently as they came . Only for us to 
recognize them -- and my mother, of
 course, she knew, but then sh -- after the war, when they 
emerged as political leaders. 

Q: I see. 

A: And one of them eve n became a mi nister in gr  -- Roma nia™s governme nt, who was in hiding 

in my mother™s -- father™s home, brought by that 
-- the people. So it was -- to come  back to your 
question, it was a house where political issues we re
 discussed, and I -- I li
stened as a child.  
Q: Right. 

A: I can -- I was not a part
icipant in those discussions. 
Q: Right, but clearly 
around the table -- 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
14 
 
Q: -- y-you were not told to leave -- 
A: No, no, no, I don™t re -- 

Q: -- you -- you certainly heard this. 

A: -- no, I don™t ever recall that
 I was sent to my toys, no. 
Q: Sent, yeah, to your room. 

A: Yes. 

Q: When you said your f -- your
 father taught you religion -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- or religious traditions
, religious values, how did he
 do that, what did he do? 
A: We ll, he was re -- a rel-religi
ous person hims elf, he got the -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- very strong religious education for his fath
er -- from his father. We nt to the synagogue 
pretty often, not every da y, but when he woul
dn™t go to synagogue he will put tefillin in the 
morning and do the prayers at home every single morning. 

Q: Really? 

A: For years, yes. So on the holidays we go tothe synagogue, all of us, I reme mber -- like it was 

one year -- you know, holiday I could play with 
the other kids for the entire day in the big 
courtyard of the synagogue. Comi ng in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the 

congregation, some thing which doesn™t happen he
re unfortunately. It™s
 the only thing I am 
disappoint ed because the Kohanim here are not 
-- except for very Orthodox synagogues are not 
called on high holidays to give th
eir blessing you know, for the -- fo
r the congregation. So at that 
mome nt th-the prayer, even when I was small 
child, five, six, seven I wa s called in and I s-
strained to hear and recognize my fat her™s vo
ice because if you saw sometime the scene, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
15 
 
Kohanim ar e the front, then they say to the back
, to the congregation which is behind them, and 
at a certain point they all turn 
around but they have their heads c
overed by the big talit -- talitim. 
And their hands, which are -- are covered. 
Q: Yes, expla -- expl ain that because some  
people who are watching th
is may not understand 
what you™ve just done with your hands. 

A: We ll, the Kohanim ar e supposed to give 
a blessing on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Ki ppur on 
the congregation. They -- there is 
a special text which is the bl
essing and which they have to 
pronounce when they give the blessing. The -- they
 have to keep their hands in a blessing 
moveme nt, and the -- the way the hand have to be
 kept is to keep two fingers together on each 
hand, tight, and separated the two, and you keep your hand this way, yes. 

Q: [indecipherable] I see. 

A: Which is not very easy. 

Q: No -- 
A: Not everybody can do it. But the Kohanim ar e trai
ned to do that. I™ll -- 
I can tell you how I 
was trained to do that. And he would then say th
e blessing and the long prayers, stay with the 
back of the congregation and when they have 
to say lvareh™ha adonai ve™ishme reha and so on, 
they turn around to the congregati
on and say that in loud voice. And th
is is when I was trained --  
Q: Hear it. 
A: -- straining to recogn
ize the voice of my fath
er, and to tell you frankl
y, honestly, it still rings 
in my ears when I think of that. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, is really -- he wa s re
ally yelling, and I wa s able to 
recognize, among the chorus of the 
voices.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
16 
 
Q: So did he teach you things at home ?  
A: So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not
 supposed to do that, bu
t after Bar Mitzvah you 
are [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part 
of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the 
Bat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already 
in Romania, the war star ted, the -- ther e was a 
ma ssacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in ™41, and I wa
s to be Bar Mitzvah™d in ™44. So from ™42, in 
fact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [ind
ecipherable] for me  a Melame d to teach me  at 
home because -- I believe we are jumping 
history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I 
couldn™t go to the school so I stayed at home fo
r a full year. The Melame d would come  and teach 
me , and will teach me  Hebrew and ot her things, but
 one of the things of those teaching was to 
keep my hand this way. And this was done ve
ry simple, anything body ca
n do. Take a string and 
tie those two fingers together a
nd those two fingers together -- 
Q: And you separate -- 

A: -- and then separate them
. And do that several time s 
and you™ll end up able to -- 
Q: Able to do it. 

A: -- to do it. And most people when they tr
y, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they 
tremble, and -- try it, you™ll s -- 

Q: Right, it™s not so easy. 

A: It™s not easy, so -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- you -- you tend to thi
nk that you cannot do it. 
Q: Right.

Q: Michael. 
A: Yes? 

Q: What sort of friends did you have when you 
were a ki -- and I™m -- I™m really trying to 
distinguish if we can, before the war. Did you 
have Jewish and non-Jewish friends, did you live 
in a Jewish neighborhood?  How 
do -- would you de-describe it? 
A: Yeah, wi -- we live in seve
ral houses, my parents never owned a house, so we had to move 
every two, three years for rent purpose and for ot
her things, so I reme mber some  of our houses, 
and you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geogra
phical location and on 
space patterns, so I 
-- I reme mb er I had a very good friend, his name
 was Marcu Grunberg, in one house, which I 
terribly mi ssed when we moved in another hous
e and I kept looking for him years, and I found 
him again when I was in my 20™s or so -- looked fo
r him. So there were some  friends th -- this 
way then, in the last house we lived in the year
 be fore we went on refu -- or became refugees, I 
had some  kids in the same  courtyard, which was 
basically a Jewish courty
ard with one Roma nian 
fa mily, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl
 in that family, who was about my age. So 
basically I had a mi xed group of friends, I think. Mo
st of them were Jewish, and then when I was 
thrown out of school and I resume d ler -- sc
hooling after a year in a community, Jewish 
community school, of course all my  friends we
re Jews, yeah. That was my childhood, right. 

Q: All right, e-explain something to me, because yo-you -- you used a nomenclature that seems 

very typical in Europe, but not 
necessarily here. You said there 
were Roma nians, and there were 
Jews. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But you are Roma nian, so why the nom
enclature -- do you think this way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
19 
 
A: Because in Romanian -- rom -- in Romania we were identified as Jews. 
Q: Not as Roma nians. 

A: Not as Roma nian, Roma nian 
was a second kind -- of course 
we were -- my father was 
Roma nian citizens, we all were Roma nian citizens,
 but we were the Jews of Roma nia. Here in 
the States, and you know, the American cultu
re, you say alwa ys both, you know, Roma nian 
Americans, or Jewish Americans, or -- 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- but over there it was 
very distinct. So when I say Roma nian, I mean non-Jews . They 
could be Roma nian or even Hungarian people, a
nd others, all kinds of 
national -- it didn™t matter 
to me at that time, the exact 
ethnic identification, but we knew 
who was Jewish and who was not 
Jewish.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. In fact, we were remi nded very ofte
n that we are Jewish by those who were not. 
Q: Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war? 

A: Yes, of course -- 

Q: You did. 

A: -- yes, yes. 

Q: And -- and how did it ma nifest itself? 

A: In all kinds of ways. In school you are 
known and reme mb ered. We  had the very clear 
identifier, the name . So being name d Catz was 
from the very beginning a clear identifier to 
everybody, first the teachers, who knew that we ar
e Jewish, and I™m Jewish, and ma ny of the 
kids, who heard a lot of things about Jews a
nd non-Jews in their families. It was -- no, yo-you 
need to understand also the background. Moldova, 
that part of Roma nia was heavily populated 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
20 
 
by Jews, and by the turn of the century, ma ny town
ships in Roma nia and some  bigger towns too, 
had -- a ma jority of their population was Jewish. 
So the presence was ma s sive, there wa s always 
an issue, and in Roma nia when I lived, it was th
e second town of Roma nia, and by that time  it 
was almost half -- a little bit le
ss than half of the population was 
Jewish. I read docume nts which 
said at a certain point in time , the beginning, turn
 of the century or [indecipherable] before, the 
Jewish population exceeded a 
little bit, 50 percent. 
Q: This is in Iasi? 

A: In Iasi, yes. So that ma de everybody conscious
 and clear who it is and who isn™t. The heavily 
populated Jewish areas are almost
 homogeneously Jewish. Ours wa
s not, we were a bit farther 
away from the ma ssive Jewish concentration of 
Iasi. But our courtyard had still a ma jority of 
Jewish people, even though our hous
e was very close to the most im
portant chur -- cathedral in -- 
in Iasi , the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was 
a very important, the most important religious 
place, Christian religious place. So th
is explains my reference, Joan. 
Q: [inaudible]. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But it mu st have been more comfortabl e in 
Iasi because there was such a compleme nt of 
Jewish people, where it™s almost 50 per
cent, if not more at certain time s. 
A: We ll, you can reason this way -- 

Q: Or ma ybe not? 

A: -- the question wa -- the question is whether th
at was real what happene
d. In fact, the presence 
of many Jews made it easier for the ideologically
 anti-Semites to build 
their entire propaganda 
and advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is 
a population which is a 
parasitic population, which 
is oppressing us -- which was not true because they
 just di dn™t have the political power -- which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
21 
 
absorbs our economic resources. Wh ich again was false because the Jews being in economic 
activities were the -- in 
fact the engine of -- of
 ma ny activities and fac
ilitating. They were not 
land owners, or ma ybe large land owners never Je
wish. But they facilitated the trade between 
agricultural sector and th
e urban consumers. And so -- so th
e number made it easy to mount a 
very strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude
 for those who wanted to exploit that. Not 
everybody bought that on the Roma nian side. So
me  did not buy. Not every single Roma nian was 
anti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-S
e mitism in Romania. The literature is repl ete 
with description of Jews in a very negative 
way. You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of 
Kike, and this was thrown very liberally to 
everybody. Not liberally in the positive sense, but 
very easily to ever
ybody as an insult. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Is -- you know, go to Palestine. I mean, I know 
that -- the existence of
 Palestine I learned 
from the curses which were thrown at me as a child. When I came home a nd asked my  mother, 
what is Palestine? So in that time there were
 boys who knew that and say you don™t have a place 
here, and use that. So this 
accounts for the distinction.  
Q: Wa s this hard on you as a kid? 
A: I-It was so me thing which was intended as a hu miliation. And when you are a child and you 

are cursed, everythi ng which is accepted as a curs
e is -- become s a curse. So yes, you were -- you 
were -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all 
of a sudden kind of sa
d that™s you are -- you are 
some thing totally different and base. That was, ag
ain, in the context of li
terature which described 
Jews often as -- as evil. There is now a book, 
a very interesting book, written by a -- some body 
in Roma nia, a Sociologist who is Jewish [i
ndecipherable], ﬁThe Image of the Jew in the 
Roma nian Culture.ﬂ The book is that thick. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
22 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Because there is a lot to writ
e about the image of the Jew in th
e literature, in poetry, in -- in 
paintings, in design, in -- in al
l -- all the means of arts. The -- 
very unfortunately, the ma in poet 
of Roma nia, Mihail Emi nescu was really a very
 great, roma ntic poet. In his political philosophy 
he was very reactionary on va
rious grounds, including being an anti-Semit -- Semite. And he 
wrote -- well, his poetry is beau
tiful and everybody can enjoy it,
 and -- and really feel the 
emotion and identify with the poetry. His article,
 because he was also a j -- a jour nalist, were 
replete with base, evil reasoning, 
which are a shame. In fact for 
him, now as you look at him in 
retrospect, and for -- very unpleasant and uncomfortable for Roma nian cult
ure, but it™s a fact. 
This is how -- so however the re
putation of his poetry some how ga
ve mo re weight to -- to the 
evil political reasoning, and that captured too, a 
lot of mi nds. So anti-Semitism has been a -- a 
big problem in Romania, and Romania is 
not -- has not expurged even today, yet. 
Q: When you were a -- when you before -- 
A: Despite all the changes which Roma nia has gone -- 
Q: Gone through. 

A: -- and all the progress -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and now moving to a totally di fferent pass, 
a democratic pass, anti-Se mitism, paradoxically, 
despite the small number of Jews who are still th
ere, is still vi sible, yes. Not so widespread, 
certainly not as of -- official pol -- policy or
 ideology, definitely not so, but still present. 

Q: Okay. When -- when you were a 
kid, di -- there were special th
ings in school that you liked. 
Do you remember? 

A: You have to ask me  what school, because -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
23 
 
Q: Okay, which school? 
A: -- yes. I started school in 1938. 

Q: Right. And you were seven then? Six? 

A: Yeah, seven. 

Q: Seven, yeah. 

A: Seven, yes, seven, exactly seven. But two ye
ars later, in 1940, by d
ecree of governme nt, all 
Jewish children were expelled from state schools.
 And therefore I had to go to a Jewish school. 
The community had to create in a hurry, school 
for all this mass -- big mass of children who 
were suddenly all expelled. I -- so my first re
collections are fr om the school where I went 
together with other children. 

Q: Right. 

A: All kind of children, like any 
school in my district. From that school I have very good 
me mories too, about little kids. 
I felt good, I didn™t feel
 bad in the school, 
on the contrary. But I 
have one scene. We had the most beloved teacher
 we had -- we had two te
achers. In elementary 
school you don™t have ma ny teachers. One was 
particularly loved by everybody. And we didn™t 
know why, but in a -- one good day, a gang of peopl
e with green shirts, leather bands, and came 
and simply pulled him out of the classroom, beat him in front of us, and turned and pull him 

away and we are left without our
 teacher. It was -- this was Ir
on Guard, as I learned afterwards. 
He apparently was a democrat. I don™t know what 
his political -- I 
didn™t know what that political 
al-allegi ance. And they knew of that. And he wa
s a very good teacher, that™s the only thing I 
knew, but they did not hesitate to come  and pull 
him and beat him in front of the children and 
took him away. And I never saw him -- 

Q: They beat him in the classroom?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
24 
 
A: In the classroom, in fr ont of the ch
ildren. This was the Iron Guard, thugs.  
Q: That mus t  have been really scary. 
A: Oh, I -- I don™t forget it, I ca
nnot forget it to this day. I -- I 
know the name of the teacher was 
Motas, Constantin Motas. I mean, that mo me nt 
se ared him in my me mory forever, more than 
even his being a beloved teacher -- be loved t
eacher. Could have reme mbered him anyway, or 
forgotten him, but that ma de hi m unforgettabl
e to me . And t he Iron Guard persecuted a lot of 
Romanian intellectuals. In fact
, the Iron Guard, which was the Fa
scist party, the Nazi party of 

Romania, even killed the -- the most -- the hi ghest
 reputed scholars of Roma nia, the -- a scholar 
of international reputation, w
ho was an historian, Byzantineo
logist, history of Byzanthe -- 
Byzantine Empire. And he was a democrat, a libe
ral, western oriented, French oriented, not 
German and Nazi oriented. They knew of that. He
 was also a politician. They simply pulled him 
out, and -- one night from his house when they were
 fighting for power, took him in a forest near 
Bucharest and shot him to death. 
It was a uproar in the entire 
country and in -- in the world, 
because he was highly respected scholar intern
ationally. So the fact that they pulled an 
elementary school teacher was not -- as I learne
d more, was not an isolated event. They were 
fighting the democrats in the -- in
 Ro ma nia. And not only the Jews. 
Q: Right. And what was his name , that scholar? 

A: That scholar was Nikolai Iorga, Iorga. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I-o-r-g-a. 

Q: Yes.  

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
25 
 
Q: When you went home after seeing your teac
her beaten, did you talk to your parents about 
that? 
A: Yes, of course. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I was scared -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- tha -- everybody ask what happened, and I told
 them, and the mother didn™t know at first 
what happened, but then she understood, and a few 
days we didn™t go to sc
hool, we didn™t have a 
teacher. And when -- and then we had some body, but I never saw him again. I don™t know what 

happened to him. I really don™t know. I tried asking -- 

Q: But you have ne -- never found out? 

A: Never found out. And that™s all I knew about 
his name , but [indeciphera
ble] hear laters on, 
but no, I didn™t. He did not reappear to the school,
 and next year I -- I went to another school, 
closer to home . As a ma
tter of fact, the other school I was re
gistered for my second class was the 
school of a monastery which was close to us. They
 had a school, and their name  was Trei Ierarhi, 
which exists still in Miaj. Beautiful church, nice
ly painted. And they also had the school, it was 
not a confessional school, it was 
a, you know, secular school, but it was on the grounds of that 
and because it was close, I was given there, regist
ered there, and I learned there. My mother -- 
my parents were not, you know, how to say, so clos
ed [indecipherable] orie
nted to give me  only 
-- and to register me  only on -- on a 
Jewish school. But I -- I was ther
e part of the year and then I 
was expelled. So -- 

Q: And you were expelled in 1940, or 1939? 

A: 1940 --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
26 
 
Q: 1940. 
A: 1940, yeah, yeah. 

Q: So, after the attack on Poland? 

A: Yes. 

Q: ™39. 

A: That was in ™39, yes. 

Q: Right. 

A: The -- when the law came, I don™t recall exactl
y when the law for expelling the children came  
back, it was a state law. 

Q: Right. 

A: The good thing about that, because
 it was a good thing in -- in --
 which I didn™t realize at that 
time, of course, the community mobilized itself
 to create schools, 
and created schools in 
synagogues. And when I resume d school, which was 
one year later because it was also the -- the 
pogrom and the ma ssacres started, the war started, a
nd I lost a si -- a year, I went on the last to 
the improvised school to finish 
my education. And what was a good thing is that not only the 
children who are expelled, but all the Jewish teach
ers were expelled from all the state schools.  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: So the community had a good supply of very good teachers, and they were very good teacher, 

ma ybe a mong the best. So we -- we had, all ofa sudden, a very good compleme nt of teachers in 

those improvised schools in synagogues. So th -- 
they were not only the only good teachers. As I 
said, my teacher, the Motas was not Jewish, 
clearly was a good teacher himself, very good, I 
loved him. But then we had, and I realized
 later on how good my teachers were, because I 
continued in -- you know, beyond el
ementary school. And I realized they were all one and one. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

As a ma tter of fact, when things changed in Roma nia after the 
war, some of those people who 
taught elementary school or high school kids, turned out to be, in fact, scholars of high capacity 
in Romania, mathematicians who were rec
ognized imme diately and ma de into university 
professors. Yes, yes, imme
diately after the war.  
Q: Right. 

A: Including Minyash, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber your parents talking about N
azis, talking about Iron Guards?  Because Iasi 
become s, when Antonescu takes power, Iasi is considered the capital of the Iron Guard, which 

sounds really ominous. 

A: Yeah, it was -- of course a topic of discu
ssion. We didn™t call them all the time the Iron 
Guard, in Roma nia this is Garda de Fier. 
But they called -- called them the Legionari, 
legionnaires. And it was a full -- how to -- how to
 protect ourselves from them, how to avoid 
them. I -- we knew where there was the building wher
e they had their headquarters. It was, as a 
ma tter of fac t , not far from our house, on a ma jo
r street of Iasi, which was called Stefan cel 
Mare, which is, you know, the name  of a Roma ni
an king. And this is where they had their 
headquarters, and of course called cuibue, the ne
st of legionnaires. And I tried always to not 
walk on that side of the street. 

Q: Right. 

A: To walk on the other side. Other time s, later,
 when they were defeat
ed by Antonescu, it still 
rema ined a building with all kind of political 
-- with -- and there was a flag hanging on there, 
including this flag with a swastika. I -- anywa
y. This -- yes, of course. So the answer to your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
28 
 
question is the discussion we were aware of th
e [indecipherable] were aware of their campaign. 
It was a ma tter of parents training children to not 
go on that street, to pass away, to avoid them, 
to not look into their eyes, to -- when you 
see, if you can turn around, go turn around. If you 
cannot go on the other side of the sidewalk and a
void them because they can hit you again. As it 
happened, I mean it happened to me , I was beaten -- beaten up, but you know, the -- the 
discussion was constant. We  were 
aware, it was -- as we came closer
 and closer to the war, and 
as I became  more and more conscious,
 that was a per -- constant concern. 
Q: We re you conscious in 1939 of the att
ack on Poland at the 
time, or was it -- 
A: My father was talking politics al l the time -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- so we knew that the war started. When I really became  c onscious of that was when the 

stream of Jewish refugees from Poland cam
e down south and went through -- came through 
Romania, and some of them tried to move further to the seaside to leave for Palestine. But some 
stayed in Iasi, and -- and crea
ted synagogues and Hassidim or Hassi
dim, and my father -- and a 
lot of them, I mean we knew it was convoys of
 refugees comi ng from Pol a nd. Roma nia was not 
yet in war at that time. 
Q: Right. 

A: That was ™39. And my father took me  to 
one of those Hassidim™ s synagogue [indecipherable] 
the rabbi and -- and I reme mber that visit because
 they prayed and then afterward they sang, and 
they started to dance. It was probably holiday, with
 a tune which I reme mber for years. I will not 
produce it now to you, but I reme mb er th
e tune, I think I still reme mber it. 
Q: Can you try? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
29 
 
A: I probably can, but it™s on video, so anyway 
-- but it was with -- was oh, you know, ta, ta ron, 
ton, ton-ton. It was a real nice tune, and at ce
rtain time it has -- it turn around and you start it 
again and start it again, and ever
y time  faster. And it was nice. 
Q: And you liked that. 
A: Yeah. I did like it, yes, I liked it. 

Q: Do you think -- I know you -- you probably didn™t know
 it at the time but maybe your mother 
told you after the war, did they talk about
 leaving, or was th
at not a possibility? 
A: Yes, they did. The -- as I 
told you, the my -- my mother 
was Russian -- well, I mean, not 
Russian, w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russi
a, so she knew Russian literature very well. 
As a matter of fact, later on in 
life, she had to ma ke a living ou
t of her knowledge of Russian and 

of Russian literature and Russi
an language, so she took a sec
ond degree in -- in the 50™s in 
Romania and became a teacher before my father 
ma -- was already in and didn™t have a job and 
she had to sustain the family. And wi -- she went
 back to -- to school at the university and 
studied for four years. I mean part time , but 
took all the exams, because she already had a -- a 
diploma, university diploma, and bec a me  a qualif
ied teacher of Russian, and knew a li -- Russian 
literature. So her friends -- there were a 
number of friends who were, you know, who thought 
that everything in Russia is fine, and considered
 living in Russia. Some  considered leaving for 

Palestine, other for Russia. So discussion about -- 
some , in fac t , left for Russia, unfortunately. In 
1940 when -- when Russia took that part back, w
ith Hitler™s support, the people who were born 
in Russia had permission by law from Roma nia n aut
horities to emigrate in
 Russia. And some  of 
my parent™s friend did, and lost 
their life soon thereafte
r, and after everything. So they discussed, 
I mean, other friends of my fa mily, the fa mily Gluckman, also the lady wa s a classmate of my 

mother, and a good friend. They also considered, 
but they decided to leave for Palestine. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
30 
 
they did, and they were so smart. They left
, they escaped the life, and my good friend, childhood 
fr iend Irma left  with them, and grew in Palestine, 
then in Israel, was traine d there. Then went to 
tea -- to study at Berkley, and became an economist. And years later, when both her pa rents, 

whom my mother retrieved by co
rrespondence after the war, they 
reestablished contact, but both 
died and my  mother lost contact again. In 1970,by -- absolute by mi racle, when I was, for the 

fi rst time invited to the United Stat e, to that  think tank at St anford for my  -- because I wa -- the 

[indecipherable] Roma nia arrivi
ng there the first da
y, the second day, I was told there is a 
Romanian lady scholar, an Ameri
can -- sorry, an American schol
ar who was born in Ro ma nia, 
who is also the same  roster of fellows. And do 
you want to meet her?  Wh y not?  So she came, she 
introduce her, she told me her name  Irma Adel ma n, 
I told her my na me , we started to discuss, 
and she said she is from Roma nia, childhood and 
so on. And that started triggering my me mory. 
I said, ﬁAr -- Irma, you said Irma, right? ﬂ ﬁYes, 
Irma .ﬂ ﬁBy any chance, co
uld it be possible that 
your maiden name was Gluckman? ﬂ I mean, she 
was dumbfounded. It was like stricken by -- it 
was my actual first day in the Center for Beha
vioral -- Advanced St
udies and Behavioral 
Sciences. The highest  reputed think tank for social scientists in the U.S., she was there a fellow. I 

arrived muc h later because the Roma nian governme
nt would not allow me to go in time , and it™s 
another story. But in the first time  -- day of m
eeting -- telling her, she 
said, ﬁ[indecipherable] 
how do you guess that? ﬂ  ﬁSo I said, if you ar
e that, I am your childhood playma te. Do you 
reme mber the name  of M usi?  Musi Catz? ﬂ  Shelooked, ﬁYes, of course I reme mber.ﬂ And -- and 

this is how I [indecipherable]

A: We ll, you know, the -- Irma ™s husband was a ph

thought to calculate the statistical 
chance, likelihood, in fact for us to meet after so ma ny years, 
with name s changed, and factor in also the factthat it™s different coun
try, different profession, 
she™s an economist, I™m a sociol ogist, and that that
 think tank has a pattern 
of one year roster, so 
we could have been on two different years and ju
st go like the stars in the night and never me t -- 
meet again. And he calculated sta
tistical pr obability of that to
 actually happen, and he came up 
with a number like that, and show
 it to everybody, so a
ll -- there are a lot of
 scholars there, and 
everybody was amazed on that. So all of a sudden 
from my s econd day I became a -- a cause 
celebrity. 
Q: Right. 
A: All -- but it was also good because I was comi
ng at that time from Roma nia, the -- the 
managers of the center knew me. Some of the 
people who knew my work and invited me  kne w, 
but all the others didn™t know anything and -- 
and knew that I™m comi ng fr om Roma ni a, who a m 
I?  
Q: Right. 

A: All of a sudden there was a friend, 
a recognized person of [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: -- who -- who vouched for my fa mily, for who -- 
I am where I™m coming from, so I felt all of 
a sudden so well in that center. Th
at year in the center was a ma rv
elous year, and influenced the -
- the rest of my life, Joan, for all my  
work subsequently in the States, yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

Q: We ll let™s go back now. 
A: Yes. 

Q: 1940 is a very pivotal year in
 -- in Romania, and I don™t -- Ant
onescu takes over, he signs an 
agreement with the Germans and by 1941 he™s goi
ng to be part -- Roma nia will be part -- 
A: Yes, right, yes, yeah. 

Q: -- of the attack on Russia. Do
 you feel this as a kid?  As 
-- 1940 is there -- is there a big 
change as you see it, or not? 

A: I -- what I recall from 1940 is that shift from
 t he -- the fact that 
I was expelled from the 
school, and that my fathe r  lost 
his job suddenly, and he wouldn™t go 
any more to -- he -- he was 
an engineer in a textile factory. 
And all of a sudden he would be at home, and not go to his work. 
So --  

Q: And was that because of the anti-Se m
itic legislation that came  up in 1940? 
A: Yeah, that was, yes, exactly. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing, not imme diat
ely after, but the end of ™40 - ™41, they were 
clearly more military in tone. So this what I 
reme mber. That was -- he was very grim, kind of 
heavy, and we were increasingly worried about
 what mi ght happen, what mi ght happen. In 
Roma nia there is a, I would say 
[indecipherable] fear really, it 
was a -- the epitome  of worrying, 
what can the future bring us. And this what
 I recall. Nothing el
se, but this is --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- describes to you the atmosphere.  

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
34 
 
Q: Do you n -- you didn™t hear any words about c
oncentration camps that were in Germany --  
A: No, no. 
Q: -- and people weren™t talking -- I g -- I suppo
se people couldn™t imagine what could possibly 
happen anyway. 

A: I don™t recall -- 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- anything of that [indeciphera
ble] I cannot say that they woul
dn™t talk, or some  would not -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- speculate, but I -- I have no recollection of
 that, and I don™t think 
anybody at that time was 
aware or -- or could anticipa
te what was likely to happen.  
Q: Now, when your father™s off of 
work, is your mother still working? 
A: My mother wasn™t working, she was a -- sh
e was a pharmacist by training, but she worked 
very little in the begi
nning of her -- afte
r i -- after the marriage, her marriage [indecipherable] but 
then she didn™t practice pharmacy. 

Q: I see, I see. 

A: So she was, you know, keeping the house and 
my father was ma king an income . When -- 

when he lost the job, there was no context in 
which she could found -- find work. Had she been 
employed she would have been eliminated as we
ll, so no. And my father quickly had to ma ke 
some  living and what they did was to transform th
e front room of our house with the exit -- with 
the entrance, into a st ore. And to have a number of shelves built. And my  father bought a few 

pieces of textiles, you know, to sell. But that 
was an improvisation because our home was not in 
a commercial district, nobody would come  there. In addition our home was some where in the 

mi ddle of a courtyard, it was not 
at the street. So nobody could see 
it, all passersby on the street 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
35 
 
wouldn™t no -- see nothing, just a bi
g gate and the entrance to a big 
courtyard. So we had that in 
the fr ont and he will go in the -- the co mmercial ce
nter, talk to one merchant, to anot her and then 
possibly from time to time bring some body, pul l so
me body to our home. And that was always an 
event. So what happened, would he buy anything?  And he became an intermediary in a way 

between people who had various textiles. He wa
s a specialist engineer, 
he had more knowledge 
about those fabrics than the us
ual me rchants of them, and how they are produced. And he would 
intermediate buying and selling 
because the commercial quarter 
still was alive, those people 
were not expelled, they were their own shops, and 
Iasi was a big city an
d there were a lot of 
people comi ng and buying their textiles, their, yo
u know, clothes. By that time they were not 
ready ma de clothes, and they w
ould buy everything from cotton for sh
irts to -- to fabric for -- for 
trousers, to heavy coats and so on. So that was 
a very lively area. I know it because when I 

started to go through to school, I had always to 
cross that street, that
 long street, which was 
called Colonel Langa. So I know, and even before 
that, my father would take me  some t i me s and 
keep me  by hand and we go from shop to shop and he will ask, do you need that, do you need 

that, you know?  There is some body who has such
 a thing, would you like to buy?  He carried 
some  kind of briefcase with samples, simply to ma ke a living, because by having a small 

commission from me diating a sale, he would ge
t a small commission, and that was a livelihood. 
Q: And were you okay, I mean can you -- could your parents afford the rent? 

A: No, there was -- th-th-there -- there was stra
in at that time , there was [indecipherable] you 
know, the -- there™s a concept in
 Yiddish, parnasa, which m
eans ma king a livelihood, you know. 
Th-There I learned that term, and th
at is a cen -- there was, at l
east at that time, a center concept 
in -- in the effis of -- of J e ws, 
and whether they we re able to ma
ke a living or not, because it was 
a ma tter of -- of ma king a living. So, do you have
 a parnasa, what™s your parnasa, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
36 
 
Q: I see. 
A: Good parnasa, and it™s like that. 

Q: When is your brother Zolly born? 

A: In ™39.  

Q: ™39. 

A: Yes, May eighth, ™39. 

Q: So that added a burden in a way, I would -- 

A: It -- very much. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The mo ment was not the best choosing by my pa
rents, but it happened, yes, yes. In ™38 the 
situation was different in Roma nia. So, he was born in ™39, and you know, was not aware of what 

was around him except he does remember, I -- I checked to hi m, as it happens he is visiting with 

us this very week, so I checked him and he ha
s this -- th -- the -- even at two years, he 
reme mbers the pogrom a nd what happened to him at
 that time. But nothing else. However, I -- I 

know that he didn™t have good years in his 
childhood. The war, the fi
rst years were -- 
Q: His is the whole childhood, I suppose. 

A: Yeah, yeah. But the whole, he was -- you know
, the end of the war was in ™45, and then the 
situation started to improve. And he
 was -- at that time he was six, 
so it was better times. But the 
first six year were rea
lly bad, really bad. So. 
Q: Do you reme mber the attack on Russia?  Wa s 
there an announcement that the Roma nian ar my 
is going to -- 

A: Yes, there was an announcement, yes, yes, 
yeah, yeah, there was a big announceme nt, very 
dramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall
 Antonescu, was broadcast all over when it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
37 
 
happened, on the radio, on the, you know, public 
speakers and so on, everybody heard it, and the 
war started, the -- be fore that, the town was al
ready full of military, it was obvious to everybody, 
immi nent that some thing will start sooner or later 
because  the city of Iasi was at 19 kilome ters, 
which is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia, which by now was 

Russia already. And when you have so much mi ght
, army in town, the Roma nian and German, 

you don™t have to be too smart to -- to know that
 some thing will happen. So then he sa id the 
fa mous four words, ﬁVa ordon tre
ceti Prutul!ﬂ Which means, you ar
e or -- I order you, cross the 
Prutul, the river, which is the border. That rema in
ed in -- in the Romanian folklore, almost as a -- 
as a prototype of a dramatic order. It™s
 -- that I reme mber, that I remember.  
Q: Do you reme mber his signing the agreement with 
Italy and Germany, bef -- 
before this, this is 
a -- I don™t think -- I thin
k it™s November of 1940. 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Wa s there as big an -- 
A: There was -- I don™t -- I don™t reme mber
 knowing at the time ho
w things happened. 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: That there was an agreement between Germ
any, and imposed in Roma nia because Romania, 
although was gravitating to the Germans, moving aw
ay from the traditiona
l allegiances to the -- 
to France and to England, to the western Europe
, and moving to the Germans, it was a process. 
But I was not aware of the politic
s or the process, but I was awar
e when that big thing happened 
at Bessarabia was moving back to [indecipherabl
e] then when Transylvania was lost, also by 
Hitler™s di ctate, everybody talked about that. Y
ou know, the Romanian ma p beca me  so distor ted 
by that, totally different from -- from a r
ound piece to some thing which looked like a big 
parenthesis.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
38 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: Shaved on the east, shorn of 
a big piece all the way to the hear
t of the country, given away to 
another country, to Hungary, so -- so everybody
 -- it was a national trauma  at that time. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I knew that some thing very bad happened.I didn™t know the me cha nic
s, the politics of it. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: But now, very few days after the attack on Russia -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- there™s some thing that™s going to st
art in Iasi  which is
 extremely shocking. 
A: Yes, right. 

Q: So tal-talk about what it is you reme mber as a kid. 

A: I reme mb er there was -- the Iasi
 -- the ci -- the city was f -- th
e city was full -- [phone ringing] 
Q: Is that you? 

A: Yes, I have right here.  

Q: All right, we were going to -- you were going 
to start to talk about what you reme mber about 
the pogrom, which happened days 
after the attack on Russia. 
A: Yes, well we were in our home, I mean all 
of us at home, the war started and everybody was 
frightened to death. There was some  bombing on -- 
on the town in the fi rst week of the war. N-
No big damage, I mean no dama ge a t  all in our ar
ea. They mi ght have fallen some  other places, 
but as I recall, the newspapers
 didn™t report any major dama ge
 from those bombing done by the 
Russians. However, those bombing were used as one
 of the pretexts to justify what became the -- 
that -- the pogrom, the massacre of
 the Jews of Iasi. Just one week after the war started, it was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
39 
 
Sunday, it was -- the war started on June 22
nd
, that was June 29
th
, we were on the house and we 
saw that there are columns of people moving on th
e street. We saw -- we had a view through the 
gate of the courtyard into the street, and you 
could see a narrow corner. We saw they were 
moving, we didn™t know were [indecipherable] but 
they recognize there we re Jewish people in 
those columns, so we understood that some th
ing bad happened, and we™re all kind of huddled. 
And sure enough, very soon, a group of individuals came in. There™s some  military, so me  police, 
some civilians, started knocking this first -- go --
 a couple of them, two, three, went to each one 
of the houses in the courtyard, a
nd they started knocki
ng the door, came to us, entered the house, 
opened -- pulled the door, entered the house and said, 
ﬁOut, out, all Jews out, all Jews out.ﬂ And 
violently pulling everybody from -- from the house 
away. This is when -- a mo me nt which is 
reme mbered even by my  brother, happened, as
 I me ntioned before, in our house lived both 

grandmother™s. My grandmother on my mother™s 
side, was a short woma n, rather heavy woma n, 
and very religious, if I said that, really she 
was a -- a bearer of re
ligion, she imposed on my 
mother to be very kosher for her, nothing was kosher enough, nothing, nothing. And she had 

speaking [indecipherable] she would berate my mother
 often for -- for --  this is relevant, I™ll tell 
you why it is relevant, for not being kosher enou
gh. So she was heavy, she was ill, and she was 
laying in bed, really laying in bed. And they were
 pull -- and they saw that
 woma n is laying in -- 
in bed. So they say, ﬁOut, come  out.ﬂ She barely
 spoke Roma nian, but she 
wasn™t able to move. 
So -- so one of them, ver y angry, went and -- 
and caught her by the hair and pulled. And there 
the hair came off. Because she was wearing a 
wi g as a very, very Orthodox woma n. And the guy 
wa -- and the guy said -- and -- and this is what
 my -- my br other reme mbered because he was 
two years, and sh -- he told me , down in there, he
 was so scared, saying th
at he -- he pulled all 
her hair. And -- and you know, my father was begg
ing and praying, she™s ill, she™s very heavy, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
40 
 
she™s very old, please, please forg
ive her, let her be there, she 
cannot move. They tried to pull 
her, but she was too heavy. And they realize that 
she will be unable to move into the column, so 
they left her in the bed, and pulle
d us, all of us. Fortuna
tely they didn™t shoot
 her on the spot, but 
this is why it was relevant that she wa s ve
ry Orthodox, and -- and we were pulled, put in the 
columns, and then the column started moving, sl
owly, slowly, because it was s-s-stopping at 
every next courtyard, and waiting for the Jews of
 that courtyard to be pulled. And the next 
courtyard was -- a friend of mi ne wa s living, 
a very good friend, Nuni Steinberg, who -- his 
fa mily was pulled and -- and brought in our back
, and put into the column. And so it was until 
the -- our entire street, that was street Colonel 
Langa, on which we lived, came to the ma in street. 
The ma in street had been already combed by prio
r groups, so once we got to the ma in street, we 
simply ma rched, were marched furthe r, we didn™t 
have to stop because from the ma in street on, 

the place were al
ready judenrein. 
Q: They had already shot Jews? 
A: No, they sh -- cha -- 
Q: Oh, they just moved them?  

A: Shot, or -- or moved them. Not all shot on 
the -- they -- so we move
d. But with us was my 
brother. We  had all to -- to go with hands up wh
en we moved. When we s t ayed, they allowed us 
to keep the hands down, but when we moved, we 
had to -- and my brothe
r was two years old, so 
he couldn™t move, a child of two 
years, so my fat her put him 
on his shoulders. And my father 
was supposed to keep I -- hi -- hands up, and th
ey little boy keep -- kept. And I reme mb er him, I 
-- that image I see him, and he remembers, si --
 was staying on his father
™s shoulders with his 
hands up, like everybody else in the column.  

Q: So he was sitting on his shoul
ders with the legs down on -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
41 
 
A: Legs, right, right, yes -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The legs here, and -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- [indecipherable] a
nd with his little -- 
Q: With his hands up. 

A: -- little hands up. And this is how we were
 ma rched. Then as we were ma rched, they saw 
corpses on the street, and we -- 

Q: You did see corpses? 

A: Yeah, we did see corpses on the street here
 and there, kind of people who obviously didn™t 
move, dead or -- or mortally wounded, who knew, we
re -- we -- er -- people in the column were 
beaten, I me an they were forcibly ma rched, scre
amed at. People screamed from the sidewalks 
who were not in the columns, [indecipherable] 
the inhabitants, insults and so on, and were 
moved there, and whoever was old wa s pushed, a
nd you know, there -- the rifle, the butt of the 
rifle pushed and -- and hurried to
 advance faster. As a -- and we were shepherded towa rd the 
headquarters of the police in Iasi. As we approach
ed that -- that place, 
we noticed there were 
columns comi ng from different other directions, 
cause you had to pass a -- a square, a big square 
and that was on the other side of the square. So 
we -- really that happene
d from all parts, and 
there were -- so the streets were full with colu
mns. There was a -- a -- a 
lot of people, a crowd 
was on front of the big gate of the -- which wa
s a big me tal gate, a wooden gate, but closed, you 
couldn™t see inside the courtyard, 
but part of the gate was opene
d. So when we were brought in, 
our turn came, then they will be the triage, the 
selection. They kept all the me n and the grown up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
42 
 
boys, and sent wome n back with children. And as we
 arrived there, they pu
lled my fa ther in, and 
they waved us all back. I was at 
that time , in ™41, was -- was I -- 
Q: 10. 
A: -- nine and a half -- yes 10, almo
st 10, but I was a small kid at that time . Now I a m taller, but I 
started to gr -- grow after 13, I ha
d a tonsils operate and started to 
grow fast, but as a child I was 
a very small child, so at 10 I wa
s still small. Other children, I me an boys  of 13 - 14 - 15, some  
were sent back, some  we re kept. Then my fath
er disappeared through the 
gate. I -- we didn™t see 
what happened to him. Later -- later I -- I learned 
what happened to him, and we were sent back. 
At that time my father passed my brother to my
 mother, and we  were hurrying back. The comi ng 
back, in small groups not in column, was a real 
scare, enormo us scare, and hellish because we 

were not in a column, only a small group. Ev
erybody who was not Jewish knew what happened, 
and so, and there were people beating my mother
, and my grandmother, who was with us. And 
my mother would -- would embrace Zolly, my brot
hers, and screaming all the time, copilul, 
copilul, please, we™re all c-copi
lul, protecting him. And I star
ted to protect him too. And my 
hands was -- were beaten by, you 
know, the -- you -- sticks, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and -- and we are running 
and my poor grandmother was running with us. So we made it 
almost -- so this was really -- 
there -- by that time there were mo
re corpses, I reme mb er seei ng 
more corpses laying on the streets, and blood here 
and there. And as we came close to our home, 
another gang of people stopped us all and coll
ected us again, and said, ﬁWo -- how do you go?  
Where do you go, home ?  No, no, no, you should go 
to the police.ﬂ And -- and stopped and 
started to collect  all the peopl
e who were comi ng back, who were only wome n and children, or 
elderly people, not me n, including some  otherpeople from our courtyard. A fa mily called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
43 
 
Zilberma n, with two girls older th
an I, Lidia and Mia, whom I 
knew very well, but they also 
stopped there [indecipherable]. And then the wome n 
started to beg and to pray, say, ﬁ We were at 
the police, please allow us to go home . They 
released us from the police.ﬂ ﬁNo, no, no, you are 
lying, you are escape. We ™ll shoot you.ﬂ So they 
-- they ma de like they were about to shoot 
people, say, ﬁYou stand to the wall.ﬂ And then
 some body ca me  and say, ﬁLeave them, let them 
go.ﬂ And all of a sudden they were let go. We  were
 already close to home, so we ran home . And 
that happened to the family, that  Zilberman fa mi
l y, and that other, but with all the me n. In our 

house, in our courtyard there was 
another family, Barad, who was also a -- a me rchant, and with 
a fa mily lived there, and they had three sons. 
And it was only the lady who was released, and the 
two smaller sons, children. The father and the el
derly son was retained, like my father. Well, 
what happened -- and I learned later, to my fath
er, to everybody who was pulled there, was that 
they had to move through a -- I 
would say the gauntlet of people,
 you know, two rows of people, 
soldiers, policemens, [indecipherable] people with
 iron bars, with rubber truncheons, simply beat 
them with rifles, beat them bloody, then stepped 
on them. And they were forced to -- to pass 
through that, and to run, and move
, move, move , while beating. Some
 fell, were trampled, others 
were hit. My father were -- was badly hit, a nd they ran, and in the back of the courtyard, 

thousands of people were already gathered. So they
 gathered the crowd. That
 I learned later. At 
home my mother was scared and concerned to 
death and said, ﬁWhat will happen to Tata?ﬂ And 
what they believed, they are still 
very naïve, is that they are ro
unding up the Jews to send them to 
labor camp as labor. And she said, 
ﬁBut he left with nothing, I m
ean, with the clothes on him. Let  
me  make some thing and see what I,ﬂ -- she was, 
as I told you, she was extraordinarily -- very 
courageous. She got in front of the mirror, dres
s  he r s e l f wi t h  he r  be s t  c l ot he s  [i nde c i phe r a b le ] 
everything, put lipstick -- she was very pretty woma
n -- to look as elegant as possible, not Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
44 
 
at all. Made the bundle, a little -- 
with a -- with shirt, with a -- some  -- some  towels, soap, some  
medication, maybe a little package, to take and ge
t to the police to be able to pass on to her 
husband so he has some thing where he is depor
ted to a labor camp, because he didn™t have a 
shirt, nothing. And prepare them
, you know, we are afraid and 
my grandmother say don™t go, her 
mother say don™t go, don™t go. She would say, 
ﬁNo, I have to go, I have to go. Nobody will 
recognize me, I will try to do, you know, and if then
 they will beat me , they will send me  back, 
they retain only -- but I have to go, I cannot l
eave him.ﬂ And s he was just about to go when my 
father appeared to the door. Bloodied, beaten, 
but appeared at the door of the house. What 
happened there? 

Q: Well, I think we have -- let™s wait til the ne
xt  tape, and you™ll tell us what happened. 
A: Yeah, okay, yeah. 

Q: Cause we™re right at 
the end of this tape. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Michael, I™m sorry 
about the interruption. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: We  were -- we ended where your f -- your moth
er was going to try a
nd go see your father and 
give him something. 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: But sh -- he came back. 

A: Yeah, she was ready with a l
ittle package, and bundle to -- to
 take, and he came back and -- 
beaten, full of blood here and limping. And he ma
ke -- and he kind of fell into the house and 
push her back, and say, ﬁStay, stay, don™t go.ﬂ ﬁWh
- What is happening? ﬂ He was shocked to see 
her so elegantly dressed, but she -- what happened at the police, the po
lice had a big courtyard, 
but as time passed, I mean, they start in e
ffect the rounding up of Jews not only the 29
th
, but on 
the 28
th
 in the evening, as I learned 
later -- we had no way of knowing, 
but later I learned that in 
fact on the 28
th
 of th-the -- the -- of June, they also k
illed a lot of people in
 their homes  and in 
their houses. In the 29
th
 in the morning they were surr
ounding, and also killing, but o -- 
occasionally killing, mos tly bringing them to the 
police. So as they brought column after column 
and -- and selected only the me n, even the me
n were too ma ny for the courtyard. So the 
courtyar d became full brim -- full to the brim, th
ey couldn™t push any mor e  people in that. So 
people -- the column kept going -- they accumula
ted in front of the -- so so me thing happened 
that they brought -- my father described that exactly. They pushed some  -- brought a table, two 

chairs and two Roma nians officers,
 with a paper and a stamp, and 
making a list, and s -- started 
to call people come . And whoever was in the fr
ont row started to move one  by one. Say name , 
address and giving them a piece of paper, take it, 
with a stamp, that say he can go. Lieber, it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
46 
 
written in that. And that gave them the permissi
on to go out of the -- so, going out was another 
difficult mo me nt, they had to run because again we
re the beat ers there. And people started to be 
freed from t he -- the police to create room for ot
hers to enter. And that
 apparently lasted for 
some  ti me . My father saw that, he tried to be 
in the front, push hims elf,
 ran [indecipherable] and 
was beaten down and got up and got -- he was 
on the side come  -- as I said, you know, and 
finally he got the line to go and got the thing and 
came out. This is very relevant because as we 
also learned later from ot her pe
ople and the survivors,
 after awhile of gi
ving those tickets to 
ma ny peopl e, not just to a few, to many, creatin
g room, some German officers appeared there. 
They had a discussion with the Roma nian officer
, and they stopped giving 
out those things. From 
that mo me nt they wouldn™t give any more. Thos
e who got it, got it. That
 accredited idea, that 
those who got the ticket and gave the address 
were kind of hereby enlisted for the future 
collection for labor camp, or ma ybe they thought
 of deporting them, who knows?  But -- but the 
others who are -- in the meanti me , the day was over,
 s -- dark started to -- to come  down, and the 
columns stopped too. And that -- that I haven™t see
n, but I know from the st
ories. And my father 
was home , this is how my father was home . I am 
telling my fa mily story, not what happened, but 
I explain how he got home. So whe n he got ho
me , my mot her told him and they understood 
imme diately, they said, ﬁYou have to hide. Yo -- 
they have your name , address, they can come  
after you. You have to hide.ﬂ My mother re
ma ined -- undressed, dressed again norma lly. And 
next to our ho-house in that big courtyard was 
a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in 
English. In Roma nian it™s a Ripa. It ™s a kind of 
little valley with some stream and a little small 
lake, I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom. An
d that little valley had 
kind of this undulation 
going down, with a -- we used always in winter th
at valley this way to put our -- how do you call 
that? Sl eighs. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

Q: Sleighs? 
A: Sleighs, yes. And to go down, and every ti me  we go here, jump, and they caught, you know, 

lots of speed and it was fun and 
the whole thing was to get down in high speed and to avoid the 
little water, the little la
ke where the -- otherwise you fall on your face. 
Q: [inaudible] 

A: And it was -- this is what I -- I learned my 
mastery in conducting the 
sleighs. And it was very 
fun, and in the winter there was 
nothing but this -- this tops fro
m the corn which was growing. In 
summer, however, that was all cul
tivated, it was fertile land, with 
corn. So the corn in June was 
already tall. So where could my father fall -- th
e -- my mother ma de some  food for hi m, a piece 
of clothes to lay on the gr ound, and he  imme diatel
y disappeared into the corn, because the corn 

tall, you know, and big and -- and have a -- and 
disappeared and didn™t se
e anything, and stayed 
there, hidden. And we were in the house. Indeed
 the nay -- night came, my  father didn™t come  
back, he was hidden there, and sure enough duri
ng the night, we hear again beatings. I don™t 
know whether my mothe r  slept or not, I sure
 did. And we heard heavy beatings, and then 
screams, th-the door was already 
kind of barricaded and strong, but
 we were afraid, we couldn™t 

resist, so immediately my mother called us. We we
re dressed. We  were asleep, but I was dressed, 
and my brother was dressed. And again my -- my
 grandmother was in bed, but the other was 
mobile. And while they were beating in the 
front door, we exited th
rough the back door. 
Q: Oh, whe n you say beating, you mean 
they were hitting the front -- 
A: Hitting, ye s, sorry. 

Q: -- hitting the 
front door, uh-huh. 
A: La -- ra -- yeah, beating the door. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
48 
 
A: Beating the door at that time . 
Q: Yes. 

A: Trying to enter, and we hear
d imme diately there were a big noi
se and they were beating the 
door, hitting the door and screaming, open, open, ope
n. So we imme diately -- what is?  And we 
went down to the back of the house, which 
also had a door, looked [indecipherable] looked, 
nobody was there out of the group of the front, sowe ran away through the back. And we ran to 

the back of the yard where there was that si ngle 
Ro ma nian family in the -- in the courtyard, who 
was Mihaescu, Mihaescu -- Mihaescu some thing. Wh
en I had my playmate, that girl, Coca. They 
were not very friendly with my mother and my 
fa ther, generally speaking, 
not very pleasant, but 
they sheltered us. So they were
 a bit -- you know, now they™d be 
really rewarded for that. But 
they received us and we hid there. And we w
ouldn™t know what happened in the house. We  were 

sure that  my  father hear s the noise, because if -- 
he was in the corn, but not far, and hope he will 
not come out and they will not find hi m. And we
 stayed the whole morning, and in the morning 
my mother went first -- sent the neighbor and th
en went first, and found indeed the house -- the 
house -- the -- the front door
 was badly dama ged, but 
they didn™t break in. 
Q: Oh, they didn™t? 
A: They didn™t break in and the -- they found 
the house. And then, slowly, we came  back, and 

then my mot her went onto the corn with more 
food to find my  father. And she found him, with 
Marcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable
] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was 
very happy hearing that everybody is
 fine. He kind of understood because those people could be 
overheard as they spoke, and -- a
nd cursed, you know, that they di
dn™t catch us. He imagine what 
had happened. In short, he stayed there for thr
ee days and three nights. And my mother would go 
and bring him food and water and come  back, and he
 would not come  back into the house for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
49 
 
fear that they will come again and -- and pick up 
the men, or the people, whatever . So he slept on 
-- on the -- the ground because of cour -- and on the 
fourth day he first came o -- in the me anti me  
we started to learn through voices
 and people that a lot of peop
le didn™t come  back. In our 
courtyard some  ca me  ba ck, but others didn™t. In
 the fa mily Barad, which I believe I me ntioned, 
only the woma n with two children came  back, the 
ma n was -- and he didn™t ex -- ec -- access the 
-- the point to where they got the ticket. And I le
arned that a lot of peopl
e were killed in the 
courtyard of the police, and that others were ta
ken to -- to the train st
ation. Again, I didn™t know 
what happened, train station ma de it plausible 
that they were taken to some  labor camp 
some where, to be -- as it turned out later, it was 
not a labor camp, but the --  the --  the si-situation 
a bit calmed in the sense that there were not ga
ngs of people roaming the 
s -- the town to pull out 
the Jews. There were ot her things on their age
nda because the war was already in the 10™s or 
12™s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke 
through the Russian row -- armi es -- and 
advanced, and all the news were very happy. The 
newspapers said, you know, the victory of that, 
and -- and it appeared that the in
terest in the Romanian Jews faded for the mome nt, it was felt. 
My father came , stayed in the house, didn™t go ou
t for months , weeks, I don™t know. Kept me  in 
the house, everybody stay, we -- the -- they excha
nged food between neighbors. It wa s very, very 
little food; water we had. And this is how we pa
ssed the time after the th
ing. Then, only later on, 
we started ne ws to percol ate, or  at least for me
 to learn that in the -- 
what happened, that people 
were put in the trains. And these were the fam
ous  death trains of Iasi, which became , you know, 
the equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels.
 There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the 
brim, cars which norma lly couldn™t take anything 
else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and -
- and freight. People were lik
e sardines in a box, 
150 - 200, I don™t know, but it was full. And all 
the boxcars were filled, and then they sealed
 the boxcars so the doors cannot be opened, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
50 
 
there is no air, and the train started to move a
nd to go in a direction nobody was told. But in fact, 
they didn™t go anywhere. It was moving between
 stations. If you ask me  why it was moving, I 
don™t know whether they didn™t know where to go or
 whether one pulled -- I me an the -- the -- 
th-the -- there were soldiers on the train guarding 
those things, or whether 
they intentionally di d 
that back and forth to kill the people in th
e [indecipherable]. But with no food, with no water, 
people started to scream and -- a
nd die, in fact, and -- and were 
horrible scenes which were told 
by the survivors after several days
, six or seven days, one of the 
trains reached a far away point, 
after shuttling far away, but a point  which could 
have re -- be reached in several normal hours of 
train, and only a few of the people still were aliv
e and were taken out. Another, second train, was 
in fact never moved farther away, they were s
huttling between very cl
ose places. No, because it 
was -- people were screaming all the time, and th
ey were stopping in stations, the soldiers 
wanted to stop to do their things, they also realiz
ed that people dead -- there were dead people, 
an-and they opened the door, and asked the peop
le from the boxcar to throw out people who 
were dead. And they brought and throw them on
 the paveme nt. And th
ey -- the -- those who 
were all right were not allowed to
 -- to come  out, wa -- and they 
left on the paveme nt, sealed the 
doors again and the train left. Thos
e who were there -- in some  places there were some  Jews in 
those little towns. Not in all, because  before th
e war, the Jews from the smallest places were 
forcibly relocated in the bigger towns. Was a 
political design in -- in fact. But this what  
happened, nobody knew at that time  why. But in some
 s mallest towns there were some  Jews who 
were not on the trains and who we
re summoned to collect those peopl
e, and to bring them in the 
cemetery. In other pl aces, they were si mply loaded on horse dr awn carts and dumped in the 

cemetery. Were some  interesting scenes because as
 a train like that, scr
eaming, come s  and stays, 
and people hear of that, and some  
of the locals came  too. Some cursed, some  others tried to help. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
51 
 
And there are -- there are records ma de by the su
rvivors who testified th
at some  of those who 
came really wanted to help, and to give them wa
ter. Some traded the water and the people in the 
boxcar gave them rings, and gold, and whatever 
they had on them. Others simply grabbed and 
give them. One -- I remember that one of t
hose who was reported doing so was recognized by 
Yad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People. 
And her name  is there, and he™s -- she™s very 
much revered -- revered. Victoria Agarici is he
r name . She is being described by the survivors by 
setting the gendarme aside. ﬁI don™t care about y
ou, I need to give wate
r and bread to those 
people. Beat me  if you want.ﬂ 
And she broke through the rows  
and approached the train and 
gave people water. I mean, it™s a very emotional, 
but this is the story, a
nd she saved probably the 
lives of some of those people who were -- you 
know, people drank the urine of other people. 
There was a hole in the wooden 
-- in the board, they would 
struggle among themselves who 
could put his mouth on that hole to breathe some  
fresh air from outside. So horrible Danté-esque 
scenes inside. And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what 
she felt was right, and to give the 
food and to save other people. So this is what happened. This is 
how so -- the m -- the majority of
 the people who were put on the 
trains died on the tra -- either 
died on the train, or came out at th
e arrival point of the first trai
n and died in the next several 
hours. And their numbers, which probably the Ho
locaust Museum has, a bout how many exactly 
survived, and how many died, becau
se statistics were kept, all -- 
all those by -- by the killers, and 
they reported so ma ny c orpses, which were [indeci
pherable] in fact, there is a report which was 
discovered in the archives of the -- the special
 service, security service of Roma nia, who 

apparently organized the ma ssacre of the Jews, ab
out the total number of
 Jews who we re killed. 
That was a report th-the pride, accomplishment 
and was reported by numbers, and the document 
exist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scar
y figure. If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
52 
 
people in total were killed in those days. And 
this was a report sent by the local unit of that 
special service to their superi
ors, as an accomplishment. I couldn™t gi ve you my own opinion, I 
don™t have a number, but I know how ma ny I saw myself
. But this is a total number, so they kept 
numbers also on the people who survived fromt he trains, and people who were unloaded. But I 
can again say that I saw in this 
-- in the 90™s, when I was able again to travel to Romania, and I 
did travel. I got married in the meantime, here
 in the States, and I took my wife, who is 
American, and we went through the route of the 
Moldova, and stopped in all these little t-towns 
until we went to Ia si, where I was born and showed her, and then went further. She™s also an 

anthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in th
e story of my fa mily, and the story of the Jews 
in -- in Romania. She™s -- her field of study is
 Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which -- 
she wrote books on that. No -- well -- very we
ll known anthropologist. 
And of course was 
interested herself in seeing what happened. And in
 those little towns, coming close to Iasi, where 
the train stopped, we visit cemeteries, and you ca
n see huge graves, collective graves, in which 
those bodies were dumped, without any iden
tification, nobody knows wh
o was buried where. 
Shortly thereafter, the war, t
hose common graves covered, you 
know, by soil and -- and branches 
got, you know, stone covers, and imme diate after 
the war, the community, the town put huge 
slabs of concrete. It™s not norma l gravestone, bu
t they are -- they are enormously impr essive 
because you see slabs of concrete cove ring the co
llective graves of those killed in the trains, 
which are stretchi ng fr om here all the way to th
e wall ther e, one after the other, one after the 
other. 

Q: So 20 or 30 feet of -- 

A: Pardon me? 

Q: 20 or 30 feet of concrete.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
53 
 
A: There were about even more, seven, eight me
ters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet 
length. All standard cement, you know, some  -- but
 those are the collectiv
e graves, which were 
set imme diately after the war -- I mean, the -- the 
-- the slabs. And histori
cal -- historical paradox 
and irony, and the sociological paradox is that those 
-- the graves of those ki
lled in those -- in the 
ma ssacres, are in seve ral cemeteries not far from
 another corner of th
e ceme tery, which co-
contained the graves of people w
ho were killed during the first 
World War, and in some  prior 
war, which was called the Wa r of Independence, wh
en some Jews were allowed to fi ght for -- in 
the army. Still di stinguished as Jews, but they™re 
very willing to fight and proud to fight for the 
independence of Roma ni a. And then they were
 buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their 
rema ins were brought because they were Jews, in
 -- but the Jewish communities were very proud 
that part of their community 
gave their lives in the fight 
and in the war for Roma nia™s 
independence. It was a ma tter of honor, and the desi
re to ma ke their contribution to the country 
and identify with the right cau
se of independence of the count
ry they were living. And that 
corner of ceme tery, the heroes of
 the independence war, and of th
e fi rst war is always treasured, 
and kind of honored specifically. And next to it y
ou can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in 
a ma ssacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year 

on a even larger scale to so ma ny ot
her hundreds and thousands of Jews.  
Q: Right. 

A: So this is -- it was -- later when we -- some
 of the people who rema in
ed alive, send messages 
where they ar e, and their fa milies went and c
ontac ted, and tried to fi nd out whether their own 
relatives were among the survivors. One arrived 
in some  wha  -- Calarasi. And another, which 
was farther away, another was in Portleroi which wa
s closer and easier from Iasi to travel there. 
And you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family me mbers, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
54 
 
and were -- got the news that their 
father, or their brother, or thei
r son didn™t ma ke it, was killed, 
and others wa s all right, no, you know, that -- 
you know, Sroul Abramovitch died. I know for 
sure because he died in front of me . And th
e other died, and I know
 when his body was -- was 
thrown down. So they found -- they got the certaint
y of having lost those people forever. So it 
was a continuous awaren
ess of that pogrom. 
Q: [indecipherable] in some  way, because -- 
A: No, no, I mean the -- the -- the climate the pe
ople who disappeared were first deemed alive 
and hopefully will return, because as I said, no
t only my parents, but others thought that 
eventually they are being transpor -- transporte
d to some labor camps. The country was in war, 
the need for labor was obvious. It was a pl
ausible -- ma ybe it was wishful thinking, but nobody 
could imagine that they -- people, live people are 
being put in train and s
huffled from one place 
to the other, without food and wa -- to be kille
d, or be killed in -- s --
 but this happened, so 
awareness seeped in more and more, and the tr
agedy, and the crying and th-the suffering and the 
fear was -- were prevailing.  

Q: Right. 

A: So it was very hard months and years, and my 
parents kept me  the entire year, inside the -- the 
house and would not allow me  to go except in th
e courtyard under supervision, to know all the 
time what happened to me . No going out on the stre
et. And I was not the only child treated this 
way by their fa milies. So, it was a time  of hard
 oppression, of fear for the -- in the entire 
community. And the awareness of
 -- of the loss, and of the 
ma ssacre, which nobody would have 
conceived that. You know, there -- that was not
 actually the first in 
Romania, there were 
pogroms before, in ™97 -- 1907, some  Jews we
re killed, there were riots in Roma nia 
[indecipherable] killed. There was a small pogr
om in 1940, apparently done by the military, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
55 
 
which some  people learned about it
. I did not know about that at th
at time, I was a kid, but it was 
in Dorohoi. A number of Jews, tw
o or 300 were killed. I read about
 it later. My parents could 
have known that it happened in 1940. We  all knew, however -- I also knew tha -- about what 
happened in January in ™41 before Roma nia entere
d the war, when there 
was the -- not the riot 
but the attempt to a coup -- coup d™etat that 
-- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power, and 
Antonescu was the leader, use the ar
my to -- to squelch that -- that
 attemp t to grab the power, an-
and defeated the Iron Guard. But 
during the Iron Guard upraising and 
attempt, they killed Jews, 
and they killed also Romanian police or Roma
nian soldiers who fought them. When they took 

the Roma nian soldiers, which were Ro ma nian, they
 would still kill them. But for the Jews, there 

was a special treatme nt. They took the Jews w
hom they caught, brought them to the town 
slaughterhouse, killed them, and ha ng their bodies. 
And the newspapers carri
ed pictures of that. 
The reason the newspapers carried pi ctur es wa
s bay -- because the newspapers of Antonescu, 

who fought the Iron Guard, was interested to 
show what the Iron Guard was doing, killing 
Roma nians, and also those jidan, you know, th-t
he Jews. And look what they did, they were 
savages and -- 

Q: I™m afraid we have to stop. Sorry.

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Michael, can you give us some  sense of what th
at year of being in th
e house pretty much -- I 
mean, I know you went into the courtyard, 
but you were not a free kid any more.  
A: No, no, well it was a very hard year. It was 
a general year of -- of
 -- a sense of impending 
doom. After all we heard that ha-happened, the 
fear was pervasive in our bones, it could re-
happen again every -- every day in fact. We  were
 seeing that the presence of the army was less, 
and there was apparent  quiet, but the rumor m
ill and the fears, the -- 
the -- the sense that, you 
know, we have no -- no -- no protection whatever, 
you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the 
me rcy of anything anybody wanted to do. And there was now and then, news comi ng about 
some body was beaten, some body was 
-- you know, in the open day, everything was stolen from 
him, and be aten and left there in full day -- fu
ll daylight. And police didn™t say anything. So, the 

sense was that you were 
under siege all the time. 
Q: We re you conscious of this as a 10 year old? 
A: Yeah, I wasn™t -- I was, beca -- you know, I di
d have at that time , 10 - 11 years, but those 
events ma ke you more mature than your age, and your fear makes you sensitive. No, th -- and 
real things happened, it 
was not simply a -- an anonymous or
 kind of general unexplained fear. 
My father for instance, and other Jews, receiv
ed a paper which was called Call Order. Was a 
military paper fr om the military service sayi ng -- and this was tha --  six months we -- after the --  

the ma ssacre, in beginning of ™42. They say, here
by you are informed that you 
are to deliver to -- 
to work as labor -- forced labor. You are part 
of a team numb er 38, or some  number, under the 
team leader is so and so. This is the place wh
ere you have to be present when called. The calls 
will be ma de publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you imme diately have to present 

yourself at that place, un
der severe penalties. Signed, the milita
ry circle of Iasi. So we received 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
57 
 
that, and that document I -- I reme mb er was the -- the 
scar iest of all. So fi nally they said they are 
comi ng now around to put out all the Jews, to ro
und them up and to send, and this is even 
official, and not unan -- announced. And with -- ma
ke -- happen all the day because there is no 
today. And so you lived in fear that that orde
r would be executed any time, and would not know 
what would happen to -- to him, or to us. 
And sure enough, shortly th
ereafter that order came 
another one asking him to -- to come to be pres
ent for forced labor at the pl ace, which was the 
address of the train station. Now this was a train 
st ation from where the -- 
the death trains were 
sent out. And here is a paper as
king him to come  there and -- a
nd work, so you can imagine wha t  
he thought. Will he ever come back, or are they
 all rounding them up there under some kind of 
order, pretext, whatever . They will load them on th
e trai n and here it will ha ppen again, they will 
be killed, taken away, you will never see them. On
 the other hand, he couldn™t not go. How could 
he not go, because it was obvious they had his na me  
and his address and in full. So, with all the 
fear in your heart, and other people also receiv
ed, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill k-
kept going, did you receive, did you 
receive, I did receive, I di
dn™t receive, why didn™t that 
receive, what will ha ppen. So on the appointed 
da y, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier 
because it wa s a cold winter, with a package, 
you know, to last him, and he was summoned and 
he had to go to the train stati
on. At the train station they were all put to shovel snow, and clean 
that and clean that, and we were
 waiting, waiting. And it was the explosion of joy when at the 
end of the day we saw him back. We  didn™t know whether he will come  back. And he worked 

there for I don™t know how ma ny, 
a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day, 
and others came  back. They did not
 send those -- them again or ki
ll them. Wa s hard work, forced 
labor, but they all came back. But wi
th the indication that 
they can be called again any time. So if 
-- we all lived in expectation of another call, so
 the -- the sense of fear
, the terror, the impending 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
58 
 
risks or -- were there. And he was called indeed
, but he came back. Interesting enough, the par -- 
the bureaucracy works in all syst em. He received a document that he di d pr esent hi mself to that 
place, and he  did the days of labor. And I have
 the documents of, you know, the call order, and 
the confirmation that he was present and did 
the hard labor, si gned by the military, you know, 

departme nt, with the dates exactly what it is. So
 that was the year -- oh, yes, I was saying about 
all the Jews, there was, at the end of spring, the --
 the -- the news came that
 all the Jews will have 
to be submitted to a census, the entire Jewish population. And that should be done through the 

Jewish community, the Jewish community was respons
ible that -- that all 
the Jews be recorded. 
Now, we knew that the Jewish community knew w
ho the Jews are and where they are, so why is 

there all of a sudden need to do ag
ain such a thing?  Agai
n, th -- all the inferenc
es and the fears. It 
was just short of a year fr om the pogrom, from the ma ssacre in May, June. And it was announced 

and we lived in fear and then there were cards se
nt for each to fill in, because it was a census to 
be filled in. Indeed, the community was asked to 
do, to submit to the government. We didn™t hear 
the community, we fer -- we feared what was 
going to happen, and everybody had to receive, 
old, young, child, no ma tter, so we fe 
-- I -- I filled th
e card of that census my
self, as the original 
document, which was titled, you know, census 
of all inhabitants with Jewish blood. 
Recensami ntul locuitor cu ringelvreese. I mean, 
this is how blunt it was, nothing veiled, nothing 
hi -- 

Q: And this is the Roma nian governme nt 
[indecipherable] this is not Germans. 
A: This is the Roma nian governme nt, no, no, no, th
is is absolutely the Roma nian government, 
and -- and it was [indecipherable] 
my name, my age, my place of -- my address, my everythi ng. 
And because I was a mi nor, my father was -- ha
d -- there was a place to record that -- his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
59 
 
signature, to guarantee for the accu
racy of the data. So I was also
 on the record as a inhabitant 
with Jewish blood. You know, availa
ble for pick up, if needed.  
Q: Now, is this true of everybody in the household, your mot her, and your -- 
A: Everybody, yes, everybody. 

Q: Everybody?  So all the wome n -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- and all the men? 

A: All the -- inclu -- 

Q: Including your little brother? 

A: Including my little brother. Everybody w
ith Jewish blood. He ma y have his own card, 

because my -- my father and my mother saved th
at. I have mi ne from my -- through my mother 
and I don™t know that he has it. But it is, it has all 
the stamps on the four -- front, on the back. It™s 
a document, you know. Maybe sometime I™ll donate 
it to the Holocaust Museum, be cause it 
[indecipherable] a document. So yo
u may realize from those mo ment
s which I try to reconstruct, 
the -- the climate in which we lived, and how ever
ything like that was like a 
-- a jolt of fear and 
you know, shaking us up and throwing us back in
to fear and uncertainty and th-the sense of 
constant siege, and a risk of life. You know, 
I told you when I came -- I was near execution on 
the way back from the police quarters when they
 caught us, stopped us and put us with the face 
to the wall. And they said, you escaped, you will 
-- going to be  killed, until that voice sounded, 
let them go. But it was impending execution to be
 with your face -- so you don™t forget easily 
such things. So that was what we felt 
at the time and how the year went, and -- 

Q: Just -- was your sleep disordered?  I mean, dur
ing that year when you were in the house, and 

clearly by then you know that thin
gs are extremely tense and some thing horrible can happen at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
60 
 
any mo ment. Do you have nightma res?  Do you -- 
I mean are you still this -- a kid whose -- and 
you -- 

A: Y -- like I say, it™s very likely 
plausible, I -- I -- perhaps it wa
s. I don™t have a recollection to 
say specifically that this happene
d to me . The only thing I knew th
at I do recall that I lived in 
fear, that I was afraid to go out re
 -- there was no need for parents 
to restrain me  too much to not 
go on the street, I wouldn™t go on my own. 

Q: I see. 

A: [indecipherable] here. And it was justified beca
use later when I was star -- started leaving the 
house, I was once knocked down by some body who was comi ng across me , didn™t show any sign 

of hostility except he st opped one me ter in fr ont of me, and when I came close, he really slapped 

-- knocked me down until I was down. He -- in 
fact, I saw hi m taking the glove, and stopping 
them, he knocked me  down, and then I was down. 
He didn™t say a word, he
 put his gloves back, 
and walked away. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So I waited for him t o walk away, I collected 
myself and -- and ran back home. Well, so this -
- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- so I don™t know whether I had nightma res, 
but I know that it was a nightma re during -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- awake hours yes. In wake hours. 

Q: An-And how did your mother and father get food for you all?  Where -- 

A: I cannot say, but it was -- they had to do exped
itions outside, they were selling certain things. 
There were -- yes, I do reme mber some  things
. You know, Roma nia was an agrarian country, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
61 
 
lot of f-food was brought by -- and there were 
wo me n peasants who would bring thing in the 
ma rket, and then they started to bring things to
 home , realizing that pe
ople don™t come  to the 
ma rket, but they ma y be customers at home . And 
they will say [indecipherable] smintina brinza, 
which is sour cream, or cheese, or other things
, some  vegetables. And -- and this was truck, this 
was exchange of food for items. 

Q: I was going to say, because your
 parents don™t have money. 
A: No mone y, no. There were thi
ngs being given to those wome n, 
and then a bag to come back, 
and they would come  back after 
three weeks or four weeks, br
ing another thing, sometime they 
brought a -- a chicken. And this was the way we™r
e getting food, they were
 trading things from 
the house. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did you feel hungry during 
that period, or do you reme mber? 
A: I don™t reme mber.  

Q: You don™t reme mber. 
A: I -- well, I think that whatev
er food there was came first to me  and to my brother, in the 
house, yes. 
Q: And then your parents last, right. 

A: Because we were very loved as children -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and I know that my  mother 
ate very little. My father ate a 
bit more, but no, I don™t -- I don™t 
recall being hungry, I don™
t recall being hungry. Oh, my parents 
did some thing. They realized -- 
yes, this is signifi cant, they realized how lonely
 I am, and how bad it is for a child to not have 

anybody. So they reach an understanding with anot
her family who had many children, to take 
one boy of my age to live with us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
62 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, his name  was Haim, Hai mala. Simply 
to give me -- to create a companion for me. 
There was no payment exchanged. Those -- but they
 promised to share the food with him. For 
that family, where there were a
bout six children, that was a good 
relief. They knew my  parents as 
very respectable, and they allow that  child to 
come. And this was Haimal a, and my father, who 
was an engineer, was a good chess player, taught 
us both chess. And that was very fortunate 
because to learn chess you have to ha ve a partner 
of more or less the same caliber to be play -- 
yes. And we learne d at the same  time, and it wa
s match each other and the other, and we played 

for hours. For hours we played chess, and he liv
ed with us for a few mont hs and I had a -- a 
friend in the house, in the house. Some  ti me s we
 go in the field, and -- I don™t reme mber his 
fa mily name , but his first name , Haim, Hai mala. 

Q: Haim. And you got along? 

A: Yes, we got along very well. 
Q: And this went on for a few months? 
A: For a few months in -- in ™42. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: In ™42. A period after the ma ssacre, not beyond 
the -- the summer of ™42, because in the fall of 
™42 I -- I start to go into school. 

Q: School, yeah. 

A: Yeah. But -- so this 
wa s the period then -- 

Q: It™s interesting that your parents 
would come up with an idea like that . 
A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, yes, yes, th
ey did, and that -- I wish I can name  that person, 
though. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
63 
 
Q: Yes. Did you play with your brother also, 
cause here it is, your 
tiny, little brother. 
A: We ll, not chess [indecipherable] 
Q: No, I understand. 

A: But yes, I played, but he was really small. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, he was -- in ™42 he was th
ree years old, ™44, so [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: -- I was already 11 years old. 

Q: Right, you™re a big guy. 

A: Yeah, so he claims that I wasn™t very ni
ce to him always, but -- but so I loved him. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, he was my -- I protected him when pe
ople were beating my mo ther with him in her 
arms. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So I love him, and he wa
s my brother, but I don™t thi
nk we played a lot together. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Yeah. At that time it was a big age difference. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean later, you know, th
e age didn™t count so much. 
Q: Now, some  ti me  in ™42, you™re able to
 go to a Jewish community synagogue school. 
A: Yes, and -- 

Q: Does that -- so that you leave the house? 

A: Yes, I leave the house, as I 
said, things slow
ly, slowly -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
64 
 
Q: Got a little better. 
A: Yeah, we had the -- the census of the Jewish community done by the Jewish community. We  

are afraid that something will happen. A mont
h passed, two months passed. People fro m the 
community said no, we gave the data over here, but
 we don™t think s -- the danger is -- send your 

children to school, we™ll do the best to protect, so
 they encouraged, and then they send me  to 
school indeed. Indeed we saw -- we saw that 
although the census was ma de, and my ca rd bears 
the date of the census, which was June, I believ
e, ™42, and one month, tw
o months later, nothing 
happened. There was evidence of who are the Je
ws, but nothing happened. At the same  ti me , 
which was a very important factor, the Romanian ar
my was vi ctorious. It was far away, deep into 
the Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a 
sense of triumph in the Roma nian community 
and clearly they were -- there we
re a lot of things being stolen
 from Russia and comi ng in, it was 
known there is a -- trains of items  we re brought a
nd officers came  with cars loaded, military cars 
with thei r own build -- I mean, their items stolen
 and -- so some how the concern with the Jews 
decreased a bit, and we felt that. So it was a bit 
more relaxed and they send me  to school. They 
wanted to -- me  to learn some thing. I told 
you that during the same  year, I was -- a Melame d 
came to our home . Again my father asked some body who was younger than him 

[indecipherable] to come  and teach me . And again, the payment was in -- in things. And he came 

and taught both me  and Haimala the -- the Hebrew al
phabet, and this is when I actually started. I 

know -- I reme mber we weren™t too good students a
nd he was not a very tough teacher and ri -- 
we didn™t do our schoolwork and so on, it wasn™t 
-- I didn™t learn too much. But he came -- he 
came and he tried, so I wa s a bit prepared. And my 
mother would talk to me about literature, so 
some kind of home schooling, and my father di
d with me , ma th. Math, ma thematics, you know, 
arithmetics, to -- to teach me the f -- the things
, because he was an engineer. And then Haimala, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
65 
 
too. So we had some  kind of i mprovised schooling at home. And then they said, you know, the 
child gr ows, he has to go to school. And they send me  to school, and first I was accomp anied, 

then finally I would go by myself. 
They advised -- the parents want for us to come  in groups, so 
say if some thing happens, you run and tell whoe
ver you can what happened, so we™ll come  to 
help. And I was crossing the Jewish quarter in f
act, all the way to school,
 and the school, what 
was the school?  The school was a big synagogue 
with a shtender, you know the shtender, it was 
individ -- 

Q: What is a shtender? 

A: The shtender is the -- the piece of furniture
 on which you keep your -- your Sidur, to read 

when there is an individual bench. Ot herwise th
ere is a full bench. A lot of times there is, you 
know, a chair, and the shtender at a chair. Here we 
were given the shtenders to be able to use the 
boxes to put our copy books -- prayer books. It wa
sn™t proper equipment for children, that was 
made for ad-adults, but I reme mber very well how 
we learned. We  had teac
hers and we went to 
school. We  had breaks, you know, we played in the 
breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in. And 
this was end of ™42 - ™43, and then Stalingrad happened, and then we became  happy, a nd the 

Roma nians, and the others peopl
e there started to understand that
 the war is turning. And since 
[indecipherable] and casualties were on the Roma nian
 side pretty severe -- 
very severe in fact, 
because the Germans put always the Romanian 
troops and regi me nts in the -- in the fire, you 
know, in the most dangerous, and there were ma ny 
casualties and losses. So
 the situation turned 

generally grim, but we were able to -- to lear
n about what is happening, and some  hope  started to 
-- to come up, that the Germans are going to be 
defeated, and the war is going to be turned 
around. So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope gr
ew. The situation generally didn™t worsen, and 
it didn™t worsen for Jews as it was -- became appare
nt much later, I did not have any way myself 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
66 
 
to learn that, but for the overall 
picture it appeared that the po
liticians, including the governme nt, 
Antonescu, realized sooner than we did that th
e war is turning and then
 the risk of being -- 
killing the Jews is 10 time s as high because they
 may be a -- become accountable. So the -- the 
state™s anti-Semite activities did 
not grow, or did not expand their 
-- I am not aware of any other 
ma ssacre or pogrom, or further very
 severe -- I don™t recall my  father being called again in ™43 to 
-- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean
 there are documents which show that the -- 
the governme nt wanted to -- to change course. 
They send also representatives on the sly to 

contact the allies, without Germ
any knowing. And that was ™43, 
in ™44 Romania turned sides 
already. So for us the si tuation was be tter on that
. Still fear, still Je ws. We  had an episode of 

wearing the yellow star in the pe
riod of ™41, I don™t recal
l in -- exactly how 
long, but I still have 
the yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in f
act. One was also exhibi
ted in New York, and -- 
which weremi ne, my -- my mother
 kept that too, which were sewn
 on garments when we had to 
go out of the house, and stayed on the garments excep
t that if we had to ch
ange the garments, we 
had to move  those things. So there wa s -- that
 situation of living between how do you I say it, 
one fear and the other, and one hope and a
nother hope. Until -- but then, you know, the -- the 

sense of hope and the sense of possible escape star
ted to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again 
because the Russians were succe
ssful in pushing the Germans and the Roma nian ar mi es back. 
And that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of f
ear that if they are defeated, and if they are 
going to retreat, we can be agai
n in great jeopardy, and anothe
r massacre may occur when the 
armi es will be here. That was one -- one thing. 
The other thing which happened in that - those 
years, is news percolated to us 
that our relatives were
 deported, or -- but some
 of them may be in 
camps. Not -- not specifically was 
about our relatives, but news 
about the Jews in Bessarabia. 
My mother was desperate all the time, knowing that
 so ma ny of her cousins and brothers -- my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
67 
 
mother had four brothers -- half
 brothers of course, but brothe
rs very good, and two sisters, 
because from her -- 
Q: Mm, it™s a big family. 

A: Yeah, her -- her -- her father
 in the first ma rriage had six 
children. She was the youngest but 
she was very close to the youngest because she wa
s from the second wife. But very close to the 
youngest child from the first wife because my grandf
ather, when he lost his wife, and a ma n with 
six children, tried to ma rry soon again and he  did ma rry and his wife bore him a child, my 

mother, who was very close in age to th
e smallest child he had from the -- 
Q: Okay. 

A: So that pa rticular child became the friend of
 my mother, a boy about three years ol der than 
my mother. What his name was?  Not shu -- I 
reme mber. I knew his name. I know the name  of 
his son. And as she was extremely energetic, hopi
ng that some  of those people, of her brothers 
and cousins and aunts, and then there was a fami
ly on her mother™s side. All these brothers and 
sister I me ntioned were on her father™s side. Bu
t her mother had also 
three sisters, who got 
ma rried there, and those sisters had children who 
were her cousins and so on. So she wanted to 
find out who is where and if anybody was alive.
 You couldn™t write, there was no post. But 
some thing happened. Roma nia got short of me
dical personnel. There are a good number of 
Jewish doctors and Jewish parame dics, and so on, of course, health personnel, who was fired 

from all positions when my father was fired in 
™94, they weren™t allowedto practice, and they 
practiced then for the community, Jewish comm
unity [indecipherable]. And then they -- some  
kind of decision was ma de to re-allow, to bring b
ack some of the Jewish doctors in the military 
to tend to the wounded, because there were e
normous a mount of wounded people and they 
needed to be treated and the Roma nian doctors 
were not enough. So the Jews -- the Jews were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
68 
 
physicians were brought back, given a military uniform
, with a distinctive si
gn that they are not -
- they ar e military doctors and they are not th
e regular ar my, and which identified them with 
Jews. But they were put to practic
e. That was [indecipherable] that was permanent. My father as 
engineer was put to forced labor, unqualified labo
r, but they were put 
to qualified labor. And 
they were sent to the front, going to the front
 back and forth by train, they stopped here and 
there. And so me  of them became couriers in tryi
ng to give messages and vi sit camps. My mother 
found one of such doctors, gave her -- him the na
me  of our people, the Faerstein family, Zioma 
and Uca and Monea and other name s and told hi
m, begged him, please whenever you have a 
chance, ask who has ever heard of the Faerstein family fr om Balti. 
Q: We  had to stop here, so we can stop the tape. 

A: How do you know -- 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
69 
 
Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Michael, you were talking about 
your mother giving information -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- to these doctors 
so they could find -- 
A: Yeah, so it was more than one, two, three, wh
omever she could catch. As I said, my mother 
was extremely energetic. You can see that I l
oved my mother very much from the way I speak 
about her, but she is -- truly was, truly extrem
ely energetic she was. And she, being the first 
university educated person in he
r family in all -- among all her brothers and uncles and so on, 

nobody had [indecipherable]. And moving to the big ci
ty, she became the cente
r, the -- the -- the 
anchor point, not the center, the anchor point
. When everybody needed some thing, they would 
contact Shanya, before the war, already, a
nd she was there. And she kind of assume d 
responsibility for them. Some body ill would be se nt 
from Bal ti to Iasi , that was in the years 
before the wa r. And she would take care, go with
 them in the ho-hospital and so on, so on. So -- 
and she loved them, she grew up there, she was ve
ry much concerned. She tried to identify them 
and -- and lo and behold, one of 
those doctors -- ambassadors, ambassa
dors to the camps, this is 
what they were, one come s back one good day and says, ﬁI found it, I found your family.ﬂ You 

know, I remember that mome nt, I mean that wa
s extraordinary. Whom did you find?  She found, 
in -- in -- not she, he found, in a camp farther away 
from Balti, the family of one of he r brother -- 

brothers, Yosl, with two of his children and hi
s wi fe. The two children were Zioma and Uca. 
And as, you know, the -- then I learned that from my
 mother, the details, b
ecause it™s -- it™s such 
an extraordinary story, and how did he found -- he was going from ca mp  to camp, and asked do 

you know some body from -- and no, no. And then so
mebody told him, in that camp may be 
some body with that name . And he we
nt, apparently toward
s Marculesti, or -- I have to reme mber 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
70 
 
-- one of th-the camps was Marculesti, and the ot
her was Cecilnica. I don™t recall which one was 
that, but -- and then somebody else, 
we have got your fa mily here, 
and they pointed there and he 
goes and he found one -- one of the two younger br
other, and not -- not my mother™s fa -- 
brother, and the mother of the two boys. And i
ndeed it was her fa mily, and she said, ﬁYou know, 
I am the doctor, I was sent by Shanya Catz, and 
she™s your relative.ﬂ And then they told him the 
whole story and what happened to them, and they
 came, and the address. And my -- those people 
are my cousins. There were four brothers. So the 
story was that one of the four got sepa -- when 
they were marched -- th-t he -- the whole thing is
 that the Jews of Balti were  ma rched, walking by 
-- by soldier of the Romanian army on horses. Put 
in column  and ma rched for tens of kilome ters 
to be evacuated out of Balti. When t he army entered they were first put 
in a prison, in the Balti 
prison. They were kept there a couple of weeks or
 some  shorter time , and there they we re started 
to ma rch. If you look -- to ma rch them to the east -- 

Q: East, right. 
A: -- to the east. And they stayed in a place, 
and then moved further and pushed further and 
pushed further. All the time no transportation offere
d, no -- no help to people who are old or sick 
or incapable of doing. Lots of 
them perished on those ma rches, you know, they weren™t given 
horses, the soldiers have the horses. And until they
 stayed in a place for awhile, they had to beg 
their food, they are receiving ve
ry little, beg their food from t h
e peasants around them, steal the 
food from the field, eat whatever
 they could find on the field, 
potatoes, raw potatoes and any 
other thing. And he found them -- and then were
 stayed in houses emptied by people who went 
when the Russian army r e treated, they -- ma ny 
people evacuated with -- together with the 
Russian army. And those camps were not in the system of the  German ca mps, you know, the 
barracks were well organized German style, were
 simply improvised, the same  way like the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
71 
 
you know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in 
the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very 
artisanal killing. 
Q: It was a very? 

A: Artisanal killing. 

Q: Artisanal, right. 

A: I mean, in death trains, you know, hacking them
 to death, it was not the gas chambers, the 
type of thing, the horrible. And ma ybe the f
act that, you know, the gas chambers are so well 
known is not due only to the huge nu
mbers but to the industrialized 
ma nner of killing Jews. Here 
it was more the traditiona l ma nner was used, you know, kill di rectly, or  the innovation was 

putting them on trains. But i-in 
the camps were -- do the same th
ing. They were herded to a 
place, compelled to work, or left abandoned 
there, fell on the ground, found some place to sit 

down. And then in a week or two days or three 
days or ma ybe  two months, when the new order 
came, or when the soldiers rest ed, they were shep
herded further. So he came  back and told us 
that my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- a
nd illness. He was not shot, but he caught typhus 
and -- and he died in the arms  of his sons. That 
the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka. Who 
was, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was 
also the youngest sister of my grandmother. So 
the grandmother, my grandmother married as a 
second wife, her husband, who had sons from the 
first wife. Some  of the sons were mu ch older th
an [indecipherable] young people. So one of them 
at the -- some point, married the you
ngest sister of my grandmother.
 So the son ma rried the sister 
of his father™s wife, second wife. But it was perfectly [indecipherable]. And she became -- and 

she gave birth to four sons, who are my direct fi
rst cousins. And the story came  that one of them, 

in that terrible evacuation being he
rded, separated from the family a
nd was lost. As it turned out, 
he didn™t separate by chance. He wanted to -- to 
run away and to run away with the Russians and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
72 
 
to reach the Russians and to fight. And he did 
succeeded, went east on his own, crosse d the front 
line, reached the Russians line, and became a soldie
r. And for the entire war in the Russian army, 
all the way to Germany, survived. Was crippled, 
unfortunately, and rema ined cripple -- shorter 
leg for -- but came back alive. And we are very 
proud of him because he  wanted to fight and he 
fought the Nazis to -- to the end. 
And -- and then another one, who 
lived not with his father in 
Balti was caught in an -- another thing, and also a
pparently left  and was on the Russian side. So 
to escape that war and the camps, the father di
ed, the boys survived, and the mother survived. 
And the doctor brought us the information only a
bout those who he fou -- he found in the camp, 
we -- at that time we didn™t know 
about those who fought in the ar
my. And then next time  when 
he went, my  mother gave him mone y, gave him 
a blanket, gave him me
di cation. Not too much, 
because he couldn™t carry. He went back to 
the same ca mp, found them and gave them the 
blanket. Now i magine what it means in that co
ndition to receive some thing like from heaven, 
you -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget
. I me t th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I 
mentioned, I believe before, that  I met him in Balti years later and then he went to Israel. The 

youngest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive. He le
ft the Russia earlier than
 his older brother, he 
came to Canada. And he™s still alive in Canada, 
and I talked to him on the phone a few days ago. 
And he -- he -- you should interview him because he
 was in camp. I was not directly in camp, I 
was with the ma ssacres, but his story is extraord
inary, how he -- they were moved from ca mp to 
camp, ma rc hed in -- in the worst conditions, not fed. How he had to go and steal and bring home 

some  food for people, how his father died 
in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody. 
The stories are horrible, but he 
is alive. He is almost 80 or 
more. And he has his daughter and 
son and they live in Toronto. If 
you want I will give him your -- 
Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

A: It™s Uca Faerstein, you keep th
e name and so -- so th-this -- th
at was again a hor -- a typical 
event for our family, typi cal Holocaust event which ma rked our lives because we were able -- 
my mother was able once to send 
those things. But then she co -- st arted to collect things and 
prepare, in the hope that she will be  able tosend again and again and again. And collected from 

whoever she could, that and the other thing. Ther
e was no other option to send. But at least we 
knew that they were alive. And they kept hope th
at they will survive. So this is how we moved 
through ™43. And then ™44 came, a
nd the front was comi ng closer to
 -- closer. This is when the 
panic st arted in the Je wish community again, that 
as the army would retrea
t, they were already 
visible retreating and convoys of
 people, very poorly looking, came through Iasi. You know, in 
the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought 
through Iasi. In the late
r years we didn™t see 
Russian prisoners brought through Iasi any more. 
We  saw convoys of the Roma nian army, or of 
the Germans comi ng in a very ragtag shape. They 
were visible in ™43, I re
member, not ™42, but in 
™43 I reme mber. And the stories was, you know
, between people, telling whoever saw, 
communicated to the other, you know, I saw 
another convoy, it doesn™t go good for them. 
[indecipherable] So -- 
Q: Oh, Michael, ha-have -- are you hearing an
yt hing about all the killings in Poland? 
A: No, no, I -- 

Q: You hear nothing about killing centers? 

A: No, that™s -- I -- I ask 
myself the same thing -- 
Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh. 

A: -- and for instance ther e were the killing of the 
Jews in -- in Kiev, which was -- that time  I -- I 
don™t recall, I cannot say that my father and mo
ther knew nothing, but I am inclined to believe 

they didn™t learn about such things. There were
 some things I believe about Odessa because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
74 
 
shortly after the beginnin
g of the war, the Roma ni an army mo ved fast, they arrived in Odessa 
and then they did a bloody ma ssacre of the Jews 
in Odessa, which were 
very close to Roma nia 
and the news came. But never did the news tell of the proportion. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But I am frankly not surprised about that, Jo
an, to tell you the truth, because I -- I know how 
the ma ssacre in Iasi happened, that was th
e largest pogrom, I mean 13,000 people in one 
community is huge, is a huge -- me n -- mostly me n, ma ybe a few children and some  wome n, so -

- but th-there was a veil of silence afterward, 
nobody talked. At that time no newspaper reported. 

Q: Right. 

A: How would people know?  Nobody discussed, th
at was buried under silence [indecipherable] 

thing. Th-Th-The west didn™t know. Later on, youknow, if you read those things, you find out 

that apparently some  news percolated to the U.S.
 embassy in Roma nia, of course still an embassy 
then in ™41, and some  allusion -- you should ask y
our expert in the museum, some  reference was 
vague in a -- some  dispatch from the U.S. cons
ul or embassy in Romania about some events in 
Iasi. But without proper descrip
tion, nobody realized. And then the 
system kept it all the way 
secret until the war. In the war there was a pr
ocess of them s - -  at
 the end of the war. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Some  of the people who are 
caught with very little full evidence, and then when the 
communist system took over in Romania, they pu
t another veil of silence because they didn™t 

want to -- Ro ma nia to be blamed for  doing such 
things, such a massacre. In fact, however that 
ma ssacre was o-of a ma gnitude unprecedented in
 Europe. Even at Kristallnacht in Germany, 
there were no 13,000 Jews killed. A lot of destru
ction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000 
Jews. So that  was th-t he fi rst big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse. Maybe in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
75 
 
Poland it happened too, in ™39 or ™40, I don™t know.
 But then it was repeated in Odessa, it was 
repeated in Kiev. Babi Yar was a 
clear copycat of that, these people 
brought and killed in front of 
their trenches and [indecipherable]
 there. But there are descripti
on from the pogrom in Iasi that 
people -- corpses were loaded on trucks and when
 trucks came  to a grave, first they -- they 
carried body by body, then they become  too cumb
ersome , and they say, you know, let™s shovel 
all of them at once, to fall straight into the gr
ave. This was how it was tr
eated. And the -- the -- in 
short, there was -- what happene
d in Roma nia was huge, and yet l
ittle known. So therefore I™m 
not surprised that we didn™t receive the news 
from all the things which happened under the 
occupation in the Russian territory. We only rea
lized through that doctor who ca me , when we 
got the st ory how they were pushed fr om place to pl
ace, that they were pushed to the east to be  
beyond any line which could presumab
ly still rema in under Russia. Th
at that territory had to be 
clean of all the Jews, which that territory which 
was expected to become Romanian in the event 
of the war ending with a German victory, should 
be clean of Jews. This is why they -- they 
moved them, they killed some  of 
them, but whoever stayed alive 
should be on the other side to 
Russia. Whi c h was -- which -- that is what today 
we call th-the proper co
ncept, ethnic cleanstick 
-- cleansi ng. That preceded with decades the ethni
c cleansing in -- by Serbia™s -- or -- or by the 
Muslims in Croatia, and in what happened 
in Yugoslavia very recently. But it was ethnic 
cleansing. This throwing an ethnic group, either by
 direct killing, or by starvation, or by hunger, 
or allowing them to be killed by epidemics. 
And pushing the -- the remainders o-out beyond the 
border. So this is -- 

Q: When wa s it clear to you how big the pogrom 
was in Iasi?  Because your own experience of 
the pogrom was limited. The fear was enormous, 
but you clearly wouldn™t have known at the end 
of the four days -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
76 
 
A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q: That so ma ny thousands -- 

A: At the year of the -- end of th
e four days, we -- we didn™t know it. 
Q: Right. 

A: What happened. Whe n we started to learn the 
story about the trains, we started to get more 
and more information and a grasp of events. Then 
the news percolated that a lot of people were 
killed then -- I mean, the people who saved the 
life, s -- told and communicated home that we are 
alive, but we saw that that 
and that was killed. The Iasi 
families [indecipherable] through 
me ssages, through friends, includ
ing Roma nian friends, to contact
 those whom we ler -- who 
they learned are in Calarasi, I mean far aw
ay, to -- what happened to, you know, Avram 
Roitembaum, and so on and so forth. And the news we -- I saw hi m dead. 

Q: Right. 

A: So this -- the -- the realization of th
e -- of the ma gnitude seeped in gradually. 
Q: Right. 
A: And we s -- we realized it was bigger and bigger and bigger than we 
could realize then. We  
had it firsthand because in my courtyard, two pe
ople did not return, the -- Mr. Barad and his 
older son. And the family was -- stayed Shiva when 
they learned about thatthing. So we realized 
continuously th-the inc -- increa
singly realized the size of th
e -- the numbers we only found out 
and learned after the war, the 
total numbers. And as I me nti
oned to you during the communist 
system, there were no reports and 
le -- except the -- the trial of 
some of the criminals who were 
involved, no publicity wa s ma de. The Jewish co
mmunity would have a comme moration of the 
ma ssacre each year and they would say there 
were so ma ny people killed, the -- 11,000 was the 
number at a certain time, whic
h they believed it was, just huge. Then the documents were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
77 
 
discovered that there were -- in the special 
services reported more 
then 11,000 killed. And 
gradually we™d realize the size, but not when 
I was a child. From a child my -- my di rect 
experience was about the reality of that happening 
to me , to my fa mily, to the neighbors in the 
immediate -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- in the most indisputab
le and tangible way. The proporti
ons I learned later, yeah.  
Q: So y-y -- from what I can tell, you would de
scribe the years following the m -- the massacre, 
the pogrom, as being sort of up and down. There are time s when it™s ha -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- when your fear is heightened, and there 
are times when the fear seems to be less but it 
never goes away -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- because you™re never sure -- 
A: Yes, exactly. 
Q: -- until the war is completely over. 

A: Like a sword hanging. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: All the time. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then really happening, I mean my father 
receiving the piece of paper that he ha d to -- to 
show up. 

Q: Show up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
78 
 
A: And then having to show up and then us bein
g on edge the whole day whether he come s back 
or not. Then with the census, with all our data, a
nd our mi nd was this is a list for them to come  
and systematically pi ck up and ma ke  sure that 
nobody is -- is -- is omitted from the pick-up. So, 
of course we had very strong indication that
 things can happen any day. Wh- When things 
worsened on the front, we -- we started havi
ng hopes that who knows, ma ybe we™ll be lucky 
enough to survive that ordeal. 

Q: Right. 

A: That -- that was -- but we 
were, you know, fearing disappearan
ce and death every time , yeah, 
yeah. 

Q: [indecipherable] time. Do you think it changed 
you a lot?  Of course it™s very difficult to know 
what you would have been if you -- 

A: Exactly, how could [indecipherable] 

Q: -- hadn™t had the experience. 
A: -- but it™s un-unforgettable. It shaped my mi nd
 at that time because 
all my [indecipherable] 
when I came  out from the war and when I started 
to go to school, and when the first years of 
freedom, everything was fresh in
 my mi nd and you know, I joined 
a group of more consciously 
thinking kids in our school, and even politically
 oriented kids, too, and engage in discussion, you 
know, what -- so what will ha ppen?  Will that happe
n again, what -- are they [indecipherable] are 
-- the Jewish problem, that wa
s a [indecipherable] problem nationale which we discussed 
endlessly and shaped our aspira
tion, political conviction, desire 
to do some thing to create a 
different type of society. And that
 is a very clear chapter in -- 
in my life. After the war, as a 
result, a conscious result of the extraordinar
y sense of oppression and injustice which I had, 
which was imprinted in my cells and my genes,
 and I came out with th
at. And that, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
79 
 
such oppression, such injustice s
houldn™t happen, I mean, again. So
 in that respect, it -- it 
changed me. Without that experience I -- defin
itely I would have been a different person. 
Q: Person. 
A: But otherwise it did change me , a nd it™s -- it -- 
it™s rooted in my mi nd, 
certain aspirations and 
values which I beli
eve I still carry.  
Q: [inaudible] Did you leave 
Iasi in ™44, or you stayed? 
A: We ll, that™s what th -- worry we -- we reached the point  -- 

Q: Well -- 

A: -- as the -- 

Q: -- as the Russians -- 

A: -- the Russian was approaching, we fear 
-- the fear thermome ter, I™d say. The fear 
thermo meter, or barometer went up again, and sa
y well, they™re comi ng, they™re going to destroy 
us when -- if the Russians are victorious and pus
hing them, when they retreat through Iasi, they 
will kill again all the Jews. 

Q: Ah, the roma ne -- when -- when the arm -- Roma nian ar my retreats -- 

A: Yes, that™s what they fear -- 

Q: -- it™s they -- uh-huh. 

A: -- Roma nians and German --  

Q: Yes. 

A: -- because the front wa s comi ng. 

Q: Right. 

A: We  are going to be decima ted, and destroyed,
 and -- because even the first time  they took 
revenge, Roma nian ar my took revenge on the Jews 
in Iasi and in other places, also on account 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
80 
 
that the Jews of Bessarabia, when the Roma nian 
army retreated from Bes sarabia in 1940, kind of 
rejoiced in that retreat.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then they had to pay -- to payback, and 
they paid back by killi
ng. So with a -- they™re 
going to retreat, that will be the end of us. We
 -- we survived until now, but that, no. And then 

everybody who could, say we have to run. We  have 
to run, we have -- how to run?  And this is 
when my pa rents, and other people started to --
 to think how they can 
ran -- run away from -- 
where to run?  There was no -- nothi ng, no place to r
un, but they said, if we can run to Bucharest, 
which is a big city with a much s maller proportio
n of Jews, we™ll -- we™ll disappear in the mi x, 
perhaps we™ll get lost  ra -- in -- in Bucharest, 
a pogrom like that did not happen. So we -- that™s 

was -- was the reasoning. And th-this -- my pare
nts started to prepare themselves, and to do 
whatever they could to run away. 

Q: Right. 
A: And that prepared their --
 their running away and becomi ng 
refugees and running away from 
Iasi at the end of the month 
of March, 1944. Which we, at that
 time, you know, they identified a 
taxi driver, in fact, who was -- or some body wh
o owned a car, I don™t know whether he was a 
taxi driver, but owned a car, and re
ached a deal with him to pay him to transport us from -- from 
Iasi to Bucharest. And that™s the entire st ory, I 
ha ve to tell you [indecipherable] the trip, because  
we didn™t have enough money, there was no cars, and 
we had to fit ourself in that car, all my 
fa mily and the Barad family, who lost the head of the fa mily and one of the sons. So we were 

five of us, I tell you about my other grandmother, 
and three of them to f
it in one car, one small 
car. My father kind of took charge of the Barad 
family who remained without a man in the hou -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
81 
 
without a head of the family. And they were very
 close friends. And indeed, we were all loaded 
in that car, and that was an ordeal
, but they made it to Buchar est. 
Q: Hm. We have to stop the tape. 
A: Okay. All right. 
End of Tape Six 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
82 
 
Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Michael, before you get to te
ll us about your trip to Buchar
est, were there other relatives 
killed in other camps? 
A: Yes, unfortunately there we
re, there were. And the one othe
r uncle of mi ne, my mother™s 
elder brother, half elder brother, whose name  is 
Moise Leib was in a totally different camp, also 
comi ng from Balti, but they were driven, chased 
to another camp, and he died in Obadovka, this 

was the name of the camp. It was already in Ukra
ine, that Obadovka, like C
ecilnica, which I said 
before, as they were pushed, and they arrived ther
e, but died in the camp, and that camp, also his 
son, my cousin, if I recall correctly 
the name , I wa s -- it was also Yosl. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But he was still a small child, or  a child of 
eight, 10 - 12 was -- who also was killed. Only his 
wife escaped, the wife of Moise Leib. That was 
again his second wife, of
 that uncle of mi ne 
whose son was killed. She survived, her husba
nd and her son was killed. My uncle and my 
cousin were killed, she survived. But my uncle 
had two other sons from his first ma rriage, and 
they also either disappeared or
 were killed, I cannot 
tell you for sure about each one and all of 
them, but there were much more losses. Those which I me ntioned I know for sure, and I know 

their name s and I recall the instan
ces we discussed. But my mother
, who kept a very sober count, 
and a very loving count of them, 
in fact dedicated a number of tr
ees in Israel, growing trees, to 
their me mor y and altogether it must be a big fore
st in -- in Israel only for them. And s he also 
created the pl aque with their names, the name
s of all who died from the family Al Kidush 
Hashem, and ma de a plaque which I have, a pl
aque at home, I have
 it, you can see it. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
83 
 
A: If you want to put it on record with this. What is
 meaningful is that in 
fact, she did that plaque 
early on enough that she arrived here, in the St
ates, and [indecipherable] you know. But then we 
found out about the others, who al
so were killed in the camps, and for whom -- my mother 
thought that they were disappeared
 in the war, or in the evacua
tion with the Russians, and they 
were war casualties rather than Holocaust di rect
 ma ssacred or killed people. But they were -- 
they didn™t fit yet in --  in the -- in that  tabl e, in
 that plaque. So there are more than in the plaque. 
The answer yes, in Romania we -- you have 
very many casualties on th
at side. Everybody had 
casualties, I mean on -- on my grandmother™s side
, there were her sisters who were there, and 

who had their children and grandchildren, some  of
 them were killed, some of the m escaped, 
some of them were killed. There was no fa mily which was left  unscathed by that, that losses. I 

me ntioned to you Uca, the one who is now in Tor
onto. He married, when he came  aft e r the war, 
surviving and came back to Balti, he married
 a woma n in Balti. That woma n was the only 
survivor of her family. Yanya is her name , a
nd s he™s alive and his wife now. But she was a 
survivor in her family. 

Q: Right. 

A: So the casualties were terr
ible, and ma ny, ma ny [indecipherable] 
Q: So more -- more than half of the Je
wish population were killed in Romania. 
A: Yes, I me an, the statistics show that altoge
ther, the Roma nian Jewry wa s one of the most 
nume rous Jewish population in 
-- in Europe. Before the wa
r about 850,000 Jews lived in 

Roma nian territory. By -- after the war only 
four -- 400,000 were alive. 
Half or more on the 
eastern side, a good number on the Ro ma nian territor
y, as happened in Iasi, and in Dorohoi and 
in other places which I me ntioned. Bucharest a
nd so on. And a good part in the western part of 
Roma nia, which was taken away from Roma ni
a before the wa r, and was under Hungarian 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
84 
 
regime , and under Nazi control, and the German
s and the Hungarians deported the Roma nian -- 
the Jews from that part, from Transylvania. So
 it was not the Romanian 
governme nt which killed 
them, but they were part of the Romanian Jewr
y who were killed in the we st, as opposed to in 
the east. 

Q: Right. 

A: Some  of them we -- went to Auschwitz a
nd to other big camps, and never returned.  
Q: So it™s not --  

A: So it was how -- 

Q: -- exactly how you count -- 

A: -- yes, yeah. 

Q: -- but the coun
ting is diffi cult. 
A: -- the -- the fact is -- 

Q: But still, it™s a huge number. 
A: -- it doesn™t ma tter on -- so much on whose acc
ount -- I mean on whose 
count of murders they 
-- their names are, what matters is a murd
er took place, mass murder, mass killing. 
Q: So you™re in this car, ei
ght people in a small car -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- I can only imagine. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you have any luggage, is th
ere anything, or it™s just people? 
A: No, no, we couldn™t like -- take 
any luggage, very, very few thi
ngs, but those few things were 
some  of the things, the docume nts, and some  of 
the Jewish heirlooms which my mother saved. In 
other words, the whole house was left 
un -- untouched, as you know, we left and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
85 
 
[indecipherable] they tried to -- to run away for 
life, and escape with thei
r lives. So the entire 
house we don™t what happened to the house, to the 
furniture, to whatever was left in the house, 
depleted enough as it was for th
-the -- the exchange of -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- house item for goods and food. But there wa
s still a household. The car -- I mean, what I 
reme mber is some thing which you d -- understand
 that a boy of that age would reme mber, I 
reme mber the -- the brand of the car. 

Q: Oh, what was it? 

A: At that time , oh I -- you know, it was a Plymouth. 

Q: Oh. 

A: P-l-y-m- o-u-t. And at that time I didn™t know E
nglish, and so for years I -- I kept it in mi nd, in 
the Roma nian reading, Plymouth. But now I can tell you. And it was a spacious Plymouth 

because in addition to the normal seats it has 
those banquettes, you know, the seats which -- so 
this is how we fit, but it still was an ord
eal. So I don™t know exactly 
how everybody was divided, 
but first of all we had a very heartbreaking situ
ation with my grandmother on the mother™s side. 
We were preparing to leave and it was absolutely
 obvious that she cannot ma ke the trip. She was 
very heavy, still ill, everybody 
catered to her. She was more
 -- more lying than standing. 
Advanced in age. 

Q: This [indecipherable] for years. 

A: Yes, and -- for years, but as -- with every 
year, worse. So -- and -- and she said, ﬁLeave me  
here, leave me  here.ﬂ And my father said, ﬁI don
™t want to, how can we 
take you, what should we 
do? ﬂ And he wa -- we were desperate. But it -- it wa
s imposs i ble to -- to take her, and eventually 
they found a solution. The solution was they went
 to the same  fa mily where the child Haim 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
86 
 
came, who was a fa mily with children. They did not
 contemplate to -- to leave, or they didn™t 
have the means, I don™t exactly know. But they 
were s-saying we are 
staying here and if you 
want, we can take Chava as a family me mber, and we will take enormous care of her, whatever 
we can do for -- for us, we™ll do for her. So this 
is what happened. Chava moved to the fa mily of 
Haimala, and stayed there, and 
lived a little bit longer and then passed away indeed, because she 
was close to that mo me nt. I believe she survived
 a few months, and passed away. I never saw her 
again. But we  knew, and they took good care, b
ecause she got ill, and she was hospitalized, too. 

There was a for mer Jewish hospital owned by th
e Jewish community, which -- it was a very 
powerful community there, but then it was taken 
by the state. But we -- we learned that she was 
taken to the hospital for good care an
d that she died in the hospital,
 so at least we know that she 
didn™t die abandoned and -- and [indecipherable] -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- but she -- it was a -- you know, she was very old, too. And -- 
Q: But it mu st be very difficult for everybody. 
A: It was very -- it was heartbreaking, and worse 
[indecipherable] my pare nts were in touch with 
Iasi by that -- those time the phone 
was terrible, but they were in 
touch even after we arrived in 
Bucharest. But I, in the 90™s, when I was in 
Romania again, before I le
ft, I couldn™t track her 
down. But when I came back from t he States afte
r that, I did everything to find her out, and we 
went to the cemetery in Iasi 
and tracked down who passed out in
 that years in the Jewish 
community, and we found the record. And I went to 
the ceme tery in Iasi, and we found the place, 
but everything was, you know, weeds and soil and 
debris and so on, with a lady -- caretaking 
woma n and the ma n at the cemetery, we started to
 dig and clean at the place where the numbers 

coincided, and lo and behold, the -- the grave appeared. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
87 
 
Q: You found it. 
A: Yes, and we found the name  there. So I know
 where my gr andmother is buried. So this was 
the -- one thing about departure.
 And then the other grandmother was in much better shape 
physically. And indeed, she survived until ™66 or  some thing. 

Q: She did, really? 

A: Yeah, another 20 years after that. And we got
 all loaded, there was no room, and I was the 
smallest -- not the smallest one, there™ s Zolly, but I was the smallest adult, so to say. So they 

combined me with the youngest boy from the Ba
rad fa mily, took up only one seat. So he was a 
bit older than me , his name  was Eugene, and ag
ain I can tell you some  of a little story how I 
rediscovered him later. But I wa
s on his knees the entire trip. 
Q: Now this is a trip of what, 500 
miles or some thing [indecipherable] 
A: No, this was about 500 kilome ters -- 400 -- 

Q: Aha, so it™s a little less. 
A: -- four -- four -- 
Q: Four -- okay. 

A: But it was not the di stance, it was the durati
on which was killing us. A 
distance is a distance, 
but it was the -- the highways we
re not highways, or -- you know, 
roads as they were ™44, and 
they were clogged with refugees on carts, on -- 
on cars, trucks, military people comi ng from the 
war, ambulances, checkpoints which slowed the 
tr -- down the traffic, everything. Y -- military 
units going to the front, and military units retrea
ting from the front. So the -- the trip was I don™t 
know, almos t  24 hours, leave one day and arrive 
the next day in Bucharest. The poor driver 
drived all the time. He secured some piece of paper for him to prove, and really that was a -- 

lifesaving, because we were stopped. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
88 
 
Q: Right. 
A: He was showing the paper, and my mother wa
s pushing the bribe. That was a pattern because 
alone the paper justifie
d, but they wouldn™t le
t it. And my mother ha
d, you know, one thing and 
another thing, precious thing, some
 jewelry went. And we -- one af
ter the other went through all 
the -- the checkpoints. 

Q: So she was the really imag
inative one in terms of this. 
A: Sh-She -- she was, yeah, she was the real -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: My father, as I told you, came wounded and ba 
-- and he suffered for rest of the life for the 
consequences of those -- 

Q: The beatings. 

A: -- thing, which became  more psychologica
lly dama ging than physically dama ging. He 
recovered physically from what he had, but ps
ychologically it was really bad. So he had good 
times, but he was out of kilter for ma ny. And th
en had strokes and -- a series of strokes, you 
don™t -- cannot say for sure that the -- that is 
a direct relationship, but 
-- so we arrived in 
Bucharest. I reme mber I was not able to stand, an
d every time  we stopped I wasn™t able to stand, 
this is how numb -- 

Q: [inaudible] 

A: -- my -- my legs were from sitting on his knees and being bent, because the car was low and -- 

and the room was extraordinary tiny. So, but we ma
de it eventually to Bucharest and we arrived 
at the friend of my father, whose name was Lupu 
Catz, the same  na me , but they were no relative. 
There was also a Catz from the town of my fa
ther, and they were frie
nd in -- in childhood, and 
they remained friends through the lifetime, and in
 time of ne ed they had the house, and we all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
89 
 
decamped to their house. And we stayed there fo
r awhile and I reme mber he had one daughter, a 
bit -- one year younger of me , so 
my age, practically. And she was -- she had a cold at that time , 
so she was bedridden. So here I see a -- a girl
 who became my friend and she™s still alive and 
fine, and we are friends. But I reme mber the mo me
nt when I see -- saw her first time. Jenica is 

her name . And we stayed in their house [indeciph
erable] it was totally di fferent for me, it was a 
big city, bigger indeed, it was close to the Je
wish quarters of Bucharest, but a bit out. And 
indeed, the Jewish community was kind of s maller 
and lost  in the total pop
ulation of Bucharest. 
And nothing bad happened since then directly about
 Jews. The bad thing which happened is the -
- the -- the allies started to bomb
 Buc harest. The front was comi ng up. 
Q: [indecipherable]  

A: So we -- we arrived at Bucharest virtually
 -- less than one week from the biggest ever 
bombing of Bucharest. And the fourth of Apr
il, 1944, that wa s the biggest bombing of Bucharest 
by the British planes, based some where I don™t k
now. In the Mediterranean, the Greece, and they 
were comi ng to bomb the Roma nian gas hills, Roma nia had the gas, and those were within 40 

miles of Buc harest, so they drop 
part of the bombs there, on the ga
s field, and come  wi th the rest. 
That was putting pressure on the populat
ion of the governme nt to -- to -- 
Q: Stop. 

A: -- to stop the war and to come  out, preparing th
em to -- softening them for -- for the political  
negotiation to get Roma nia out of the war, and 
against the Germans. Because the Russians were 
pressing from the east, and here was the govern
me nt, and -- who had to be bombed into 
submission, and bombed to -- 
to accept the -- the ca -- 
Q: That™s quite an entrance afte
r you™re tryi ng to escape from -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
90 
 
A: Yes, and we escape the war only to -- to fa
ll here, and mi nd you, what happened after that 
first bombing, the raids continued to the point
 that they came every single day to bomb 
Bucharest. 

Q: Really? 

A: And to increase the political pressure, they ca
me  every day at the same hour. Ele -- 11 of the 
morning, we knew that this is the 
-- and [indecipherable] away I -- al
l the -- always the -- the -- it 
was deliberate, it was not -- so, I guess -- I didn™
t have any contact with 
the British headquarters 
to know, but why would they se
nd the planes every day the sa
me  hour, except to demonstrate 

some thing, they are able to 
do it, and this is not -- 
Q: Yeah, right. 

A: -- and you -- you -- you still 
fear, and you know that the next 
day they to -- come  again. And 
then you cannot [indecipherable] so when will 
this stop, I me an how long?  The -- then -- you 
know, the sirens would start screaming w
ildly, everybody would run away, everybody -- 
Bucharest wa sn™t bombed during the war, it was far 
from -- fr om theater of war. In the beginning 
ma ybe some , but I wasn™t there, 
but during the -- the -- the heightof the war it wasn™t. But when 
the war came to the end, the pressure wa
s put on Bucharest. It wasn™t Dresden. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes, but it was a lot of pressure. 

Q: It was bad enough for you. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So we knew that every day. And then we had to
 -- to hide ourselves now in the baseme nt of 
the building, eventually move 
from my friends and my father™s -- my mother found a small 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
91 
 
apartment in a building in which another family
 from Iasi, also going as refugee escaping, which 
is a family of -- Rosenhaupt family. And in fact, 
it was the parents of the fa mous Israeli lawyer 
and politician, Meier Rosenne. Our pa
rents were friends in -- in 
bu -- in Iasi, so hum -- some how 
they got together, found the same  building, and th
ey moved into an -- one apartment. It was a 
small building with several apartments. And th
ey were in another apar tment in the same 
building. They knew -- th-the parents knew th 
-- I knew Meier from -- from his childhood, but 
then we really became close because  we™d be toge
ther, we™d play together, and we would run to 
the -- to the basement together at 11 o™clock when 
the sirens will --  will st art. And that  happened 
for weeks. A number of houses were destroye
d, and unfortunately the Ba rad family found an 
apartment in another pl ace, the one I talked to
 you. And unfortunately th
at was -- that place was 
close to the Bucharest railway st
ation. And the ra ilway st ation wa
s a part of the -- the bombing 
target  in the fourth of April. Ther e was 
blanket bombing there by the British. A lot was 
destroyed, the station wa s almost un -- disabl
ed, I don™t know was comp letely. But their house 
was bombed, and she was killed. The -- the baby wa
s -- was with us one week before in the car 

and escaped the war in Iasi, was killed, and the 
-- the two boys were buried in the rubble of the 
house, which we learned later, when the younge
st boy found ou -- us, after having been buried 
under the rubble for three days and 
three nights. And he came out, 
they were pulled out from the  
rubble by rescue teams when they found him in
 the rubble, and they found there was some  
plaque hanging there by his mother saying, if
 this boy is found some wheres, you know, alone, 
bring him either at that address, her address, or
 to the fa -- Catz fa mily, who is on the street 
Mogos Vornicu five, where we are [indecipherabl
e]. Or not Mogos Vornicu five, it was Kolono 
Moraro, one of the addresses. But this is how 
he could found us -- find us. He was -- hi s face and 
head were swollen from being hit by the bombing and debris and being on no food and no water 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
92 
 
[indecipherable] the air for under 
the debris until he was rescue
d. He could move, but his head 
was very swollen, I reme mber his swollen head, 
and he found us and told what happened. And in 
the process, you know, she had the -- the -- her purs
e with all her -- their fortune was lost. She -- 
they had mo ney and, you know, gold coins, whatever 
they had they lost, and they were poor like 
[indecipherable] so we had to help them, too, in th
at situation. But -- and they were victimized a 
second time , that family Barad, a really unlucky case. And then the -- then, you know, we went 

through the spring with so ma ny bombings. Yes, my
 -- given the risk, I -- there were the same  
treatment. I had to carry here -- 

Q: In case some thing happened. 

A: Yes, with a name  and who I am and where 
I should be brought. And 
my  mo t h e r  s e w e d  s o me  
things which they still had, some  gold coins in my 
-- in my pants, yeah, and tell me  always keep 
that pants, don™t -- don™t give it away and you 
know, know that in the need, that™s what -- how 
you can pay for your food. Fortunately, our house wa
s not bombed, and we lived in it throughout 
the bombing, until the mi ddle of August, 23
rd
 of August when Roma nia shifted sides.  
Q: Right. 

A: And two, three days later, the Russian tanks 
came into Bucharest, because the -- Romania 

came out of the war by -- by politic
al ma neuver with the king, and 
the -- Antonescu was arrested, 
and the Romania shifted sides. Then the Roma ni
an army stopped fighting, and the Russian army 
was already in the east and with no opposition, 
advanced very quickly and tanks came into 

Bucharest, and I reme mb er the Russian tanks
 comi ng, and me waving them, and my mother 
waving them, and finally the liberators. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
93 
 
A: You know, you hear -- s -- hear so ma ny things
 about American libera
ting people in Dachau 
and then all the camps. We were not in a physic
al camp like that, but I 
-- I surely recognize the 
feeling of people who are in a -- in that stat
e, and are liberated by -- by the army who come s 
there, so -- 
Q: And a s mile on your face, that™s how you felt. 

A: Oh, it was terr ific -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- you know, yes. And in addition, you know, my
 mother was able to talk to the Russian 
soldier who are [indecipherable] -- 

Q: Ah, cause she can speak Russian, yeah. 

A: -- she speaks Russian, yeah, I knew a few wor ds. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I even had an adventur e with them because 
then, you know, I was there and next two or three, 
four or five days the Russians all came, and they-- a few of them ca mpe d in a little square. And I 

came to them, I said, you know, ﬁDobry Deni,ﬂ
 and they were really surprised -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- so all very happy, all of them were mi ssi
ng their own children, gave me  bread, gave me  
other thing. And then they said, 
ﬁDo you want to come  in the -- in
 -- in the truck
?ﬂ We are going 
here, they say. I understood something that they
 g- go to fetch some thing, and will come  back. 
And I say yes, and I got into the car. And they 
started driving and drivi
ng and driving and I me an 
I don™t know whether the story is of any inte
rest, so let me  stop here. [indecipherable] 
Q: The place -- they were taking you some place? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
94 
 
A: They were taking me  -- well, in short, they
 took me  to a forest where they have an 
ammunition depot, and loaded the truck with amm
unition. That was still when the Germans were 
bombing Bucharest. 
Q: I see. 

A: And that took a few hours and in
 the meanti me, my mother -- 
Q: Was hysterical. 

A: -- absolutely ma d, hysterical, and I couldn™t 
do anything, I was with them, and they could 
have taken me . They br ought me  ba ck, late, afte
r six hours of -- my moth
er was on the street, 
saw me , and I don™t want to put on video, but 
I got my pants down and I got a spanking. 
Q: Spanking. 

A: You know? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: A spanking in the street
, I will never forget that. 
Q: Did she ever spank you before? 

A: Not quite, no. 

Q: No. 

A: Not this way. I mean, she said never, ne
ver [indecipherable]. No, she didn™t -- she didn™t 
spank me, but sometime  it happe
ns, you get -- and you got that. 
Q: Right. But this was real, this was -- 

A: This was real, yeah, oh I mean she -- she was 
out of her mi nd, she was -- that™s the end of me , 
that I was kidnapped, I was killed -- 

Q: Right, right.  

A: -- I was so mething, I will never return. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

Q: That™s the benefit 
of a cell phone, isn™t it? 
A: Ah. Yeah. So.  
Q: All right, we ha
ve to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Seven

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Michael, I know that the -- that
 we have a -- a -- ma ny, ma ny 
years we could still cover, but 
for today I don™t think we™re going to
 be able to do that, and so -- 
A: It™s -- it™s late, it™s -- 
Q: It™s late. So that if you can
 give a kind of summary of -- a so
rt of outline of what happened to 
you, and then we can close it off and -- and start on another day.  

A: Yes, well, I believe we  reached the -- virtua lly the end, almost the end of the war, when 

Roma nia shifted sides, and then what happened, rele
vant to the past, that 
th -- we mean the past 
is, that we -- we really tied ti -- tried to find 
out what happened to ever
ybody else in our fa mily. 
As I me ntioned, we had a large fami l y on the other side -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- where they were in camps. And my mother 
had a very, very intensive way to do the search, 
and wiv -- she found some  of the people, found out
 about others who died. My cousin, Zioma, 
who was in the camp, as I me ntioned, in Marcules
ti, and hi -- another camp he was, I reme mber 
he and Uca were first in Rawout
sel, a camp, and then in Marculesti, and then in Cecilnica. As 
they came back to Balti, my cousin Zioma went in
to the army  after a little while, because the war 
still went on, and lo and behold, he appears in Bu
charest in the uniform of the army which freed, 
you know, so you can imagine our -- because the la
st we knew was -- of him was when that 
doctor found them and brought 
them the -- th
e blanket. 
Q: Right. 
A: And he reported to us with a letter from 
the m that the blanket was delivered, which was a 
lifesaver for them in that time. So he came and we
 were happy, in fact, I have a picture with him 
comi ng, and I don™t have it here with
 me  if you as k for it, but it™s at home if you need it. So we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
97 
 
were very happy. The other cousin of mi ne, Monea,
 who fought all the wa y to Berlin, and we are 
very proud, and was decorated, and was wounded, and 
became  a cripple for the rest of the life 
his [indecipherable] came twice to Bucharest. And so
 we were very rejoici
ng in those -- and also, 
you know, mourning those whom we learned were lost
. So it was a f-fa mily stock-taking of what 
happened to all of us, and how we -- we went 
through. And that again, before -- beyond the stock 
taking, helped cultivate in me  
the sense of fa mily and what -- how impor tant, I mean the 
solidarity and the family solidarity is a very bi
g, important value for me  throughout my life and I 
believe those hard time s instilled 
that value, and my mother deliber
ately instilled it. And -- to the 
point, in fact, that even after my
 mother™s death, I felt the need 
to go to -- as I -- I think I 
me ntioned, to the place of my birth, to Ba
lti and to find out the place, and I found that 
[indecipherable] the synagogue didn™t exist, but I 
found there another si -- 
very relative mo me nt 
of Holocaust. In that synagogue, you know, people who came  back to town -- it was also my 
fa mily, my town. And they said Kaddish, and I 
-- I was given by the Jewish community from 
Balti, some  Kaddish cardboards, and where the Kaddish words were written in Slavic le -- 

letters, for people to be able to pronounce 
the -- the Hebrew word, you know, [speaks Hebrew 
here] ___________. But all thing with Russian letters 
because, as I was explained, the people in 
Balti, ma ny of them didn™t know the torit Hebrew. A
nd I got that cardboard, one of them is in the 
Holocaust Museum, but not in yours, 
in the Holocaust Museum in --  
Q: [indecipherable] in New York  

A: -- in New York. I have another one, which is
 a -- a historic document, Kaddish, and -- and -- 
wi -- 

Q: And we™ll show that in a little bit. 

A: Fine, fine, if you want to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
98 
 
Q: [indecipherable] yes. 
A: -- you™re welcome. So then, you know, the life 
fell back into norma l except that we  are -- w-
we were bearing me mor y -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and the consciousnesses we ga
ined. I went back to school, I 
went to a Jewish school, my 
parents kept me to a Jewish school as long as
 Jewish schools we re around in Roma nia, until ™48 
when the education system was reformed, all b
ecame state schools. And I continued my Jewish 
education, I had my Bar Mitzvah with a very 
me morable teacher, Mrs. Eisenstein, who was 
another formative element, ma ybe I™ll tell you pr
ivately another time  about her, but she was a 
rema rkable person, Hannah Eisenstein. A book about
 her was printed in Israel, includes my 
me mories of her, and Meier Rosenne™s me mories, 
because he also was a -- a student  of her in 
Roma nia before he left for Israel. 

Q: And she taught you Hebrew? 
A: She taught me  Hebrew, she taught him Hebrew.  
Q: Right. 

A: [indecipherable] that his pare
nts decided to go to Israel ve
ry soon, when my parents decided 
to apply for immi gration it was t
oo late, and they were
 rejected. So that™s
 why I stayed in 
Romania. But she was our mora, our teacher atthe beginning and we both -- every time I meet 

Meier Rosenne now, we still talk about what sh
e taught us, you know. She was very important to 
me . And then I -- I went into research after I 
went to [indecipherable] 
training, I did research, 
learned sociology. Also, it™s a complex period, with
 a lot of political 
implications and -- 
Q: Yes, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
99 
 
A: -- it -- it was kind of prof
oundly affected. I believe you asked me  a question how it changed 
my life. So my life was changed in the sense 
that I became concerned pr ofessionally too, about 
how societies develop and change 
in political systems. And I did my research in sociology when 
that became possible. I am trai
ned in philosophy and sociology 
and then my research was -- 
became of i nterest  to other schol
ars internationally, so I was inv
ited to the United State, to the 
Center for Advanced Studies [indecipherabl
e] that think tank, which I me ntioned. 
Q: Yeah, think tank, yes. 
A: And my wife, StellaCern
ea was also a sociologist. She wa s trained and she became a 
assist ant pr ofe -- associate professor at the univer
sity. When I applied to become  the same , and I 
got my Ph.D., I was told no, we don™t take Jews
 any more, point blank. And this was happening 
in -- in ™58, ™59.  

Q: Hm. 

A: In -- in communist Roma nia. So
 fortunately I was able to conti
nue my work as a researcher in 
the system of the academy of sciences, and I di
d my research there, which apparently was 
important enough to be picked up by American sc
holars. Then, unfortunately, my wife died -- 
Stella, and -- by a brain hemorrhage and aneurysm. 

Q: And this was in the 60™s? 

A: And this was in the -- ™68. Put it very briefly, 
I -- I received at that sa
me time the invitation to 
go to the center where I went two years later after 
a epic fight between that center and Roma nian 
authorities, who would not allow me -- would not gi
ve me a visa, peri od, until they gave it under 
American pressure. And I was there -- I had to 
come  back because they came  -- kept my two 
children hostage, and my mother took care of them while I was away. So I stayed fr om ™71 until 

™74, when I again was invited by the American Soci
ological Association a
nd traveled to Canada 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
100 
 
and the U.S.. I decided not to return at that time
, and I could do that beca
use the children were -- 
were older and I could still count on -- on them to
 survive well and to -- 
until I was able to get 
them out. And really, it took an hour and a half -- 
I-I™m sorry, a year and a 
half, almost, to -- to 
get them out. Fortunately I was offered a job as 
the first sociologist to
 be hired by the World 
Bank, that happened in ™74, just when I left Romani
a. So that was another one of the twists and 
chances in life which happened, and hey, I did, 
I hope well in that job. 
So it brought me great 
gratification, realizing a lot of
 my va lues and ideals in help
ing poor people in societies and 
changing people™s life. I honestly believe I ma de some
 contribution in that. And that brings me  to 
the present day, Joan, wh-when -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- I retired from the bank. I do continue my work and my writing. 

Q: When did you retire from the bank? 

A: I retired from the bank at the end of ™76, be
ginning ™77. I published a nu
mber of books in the 
meanti me . I keep laboring on -- 

Q: Wa it a minute, ™76 or ™77?  No. 

A: No, sorry, no. 

Q: ™96. 

A: ™96 - ™97. 

Q: Yes 

A: Sorry, sorry. ™96 - ™97. 

Q: And whe n did -- you rema rried? 

A: That was a -- I was about 
to say, I rema rried in ™87. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

A: With Ruth, my wife, she is also an anthr
opologist. If you want to 
know the story, there™s a 
very funny story because -- anyway, I have to -- le
t me tell you. It was a ni
ce -- after so ma ny sad 
stories, this is a nice story to record. As an
 anthropologist at the Wo
rld Bank in Washington, I 
was trying to be in touch with the community of
 Wa shington anthropologist
s, which there is an 
association, WAPA, Wa shington As
sociation of Professional Anthropologists. And while at 
anthropological meetings, I bought a book at th
e meeting, because I saw an interesting book, 
which was about -- it™s called, ﬁAfikoma n in Ex
ileﬂ, about the ritual 
of Passover from an 
anthropological viewpoint. 
Q: Right. 

A: Which I read, I enjoyed very much. I knew much
 -- learned much more 
about that. And in one 
of the outings of that Wa shington Association fo
r Professional Anthropologists, sa -- and went -- 
went to the races, if you can imagine. And we at
e, we gathered a large group and somehow in 
anthropology the discussion came about Pass
over rituals and some body said some thing, you 
know, we engage in a discussion and we have a 
little -- a really sharp discussion because I 
thought I was there -- ma ybe another Jewish, or 
anthropologist or two, and I knew well to say 
that I, you know, knew the book, and I kept my 
thinking sa -- on some  points. Some body had a 
different opinion, there was there 
a lady who had a different opini
on and that intrigued me . And 
she was very firm in her opinion and I was very fi
rm in mi ne. But I couldn™t convince her, so 
that™s was it, you know, we went home and the boss 
as -- before telling -- saying goodbye, I told 
her, ﬁAnd I think really I was right, you were not 
right on the point, and to 
see that, you need to 
read the book about that. And this is a book cal
led ﬁAfikoma n in Exile,ﬂ and you will see,ﬂ I 
said. ﬁNo, I don™t, I know -- I thi
nk -- I think I know I™m right 
and I don™t have to read that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495

book.ﬂ So that was -- I say, ﬁ Why? ﬂ She said, ﬁI 
wrote it.ﬂ We ll that concluded the argume nt, 
that concluded the argume nt, so -- 
Q: And did you start dating soon afterwards? 

A: We ll, I -- I tried to -- yes, I went straight 
to the book and looked at wh
at they said about the 
biography of that lady. 

Q: I see. 

A: In the bio-note of that book -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and yes, I did call her, and we me
t and fortunately we could get ma rried. 
Q: Yes. That™s a very interesting be
ginning, it mi ght have been disaster.  

A: Yes, that was the first argument she won, I have
 to say not the last. But it was -- I -- I -- I won 
also some . 

Q: You won some  argume nts, I™m s ure. 
A: Yes, yes.  
Q: And your -- you have two children from your 
first marriage, both of whom are physicians? 
A: I have two children, yes, both are physicians. Th
is is my daughter Darna, who -- I didn™t tell 
you that after my -- I saw -- they 
took me  a ni -- year and a half
 to bring me my children. I had 
family here in America, also branches of the fa
mily from Bessarabia, again cousins, the Jacobsen 
family from Buffalo, and the Rochester fami  -- th
e Davis fami ly fr om Rochester. Also a relative 
of ours, whose, you know, grandfathers, or fathers 
left earlier from Balti and came to the States 
long before the Holocaust. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
103 
 
A: And my mother tracked them
 down and mobilized them to
 plead with their political 
representative in the Congress, 
and in the Senate, to press for 
the freeing of the children and of 
my mother from back in Roma nia. And they di
d, they -- you know, the senator of New York was 
-- Rochester, Buffalo, you know, for New York the senator was Senator Javits. 
Q: Javits, sure. 

A: So they told him the story, he wrote the le
tter to the -- to the Roma nian ambassador. In 
Stanford while I was ther e, I me t Alan Dershowitz,
 who was also a fellow like myself with -- to 
whom I entrusted my -- my desire to -- to come 
and he say, ﬁMichael, if 
you want to come  now, I 
will help you now, legally. If you want to go ba
ck, go back to the children. But when the 
mome nt -- you decide the mo ment come s, I™ll gi
ve you all my support, you can count on that, 
this is my word.ﬂ And indeed I go -- went bac
k, but when the mome nt came, I called, and Alan 
Dershowitz was right there to help. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: He had sent in fact, a student
 of his, Ben Segal to check on 
me  after I went back in Romania 
[indecipherable] student. And when I came back
 that student was already a lawyer in 
Washington as it happened. So I got all 
the -- the best and the strongest -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- legal assistance and help. And they wrote --
 Ben Segal™s father, who was a former rabbi, in 
fact, knew ha -- Hubert Humphr
ey. Hubert Humphrey wrote 
a letter to the Romanian 
governme nt for my children. I was put on the U.S.
 Congress fa mily unification list as a condition 
for the most favored nation clause
, which was renewed every year -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- under the Jackson [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
104 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- so it was a interesting story. 

Q: It was an interesting time. 

A: And I got the children, and f -- you know, my 
daughter Darna came when she was 17 and she 
was accepted straight into Brandeis after an interv
iew, and she studied there. My son ha d to go to 
high school here, at Georgetown 
[indecipherable], he was a very good student. He wanted to get 
circumcision as I told you, at hisinitiative which he is proud to this day, I am proud to this day. 

Because he didn™t ha ve the chance of a Jewish 
education in Bucharest. And now they created 
their own family, Darna is ma rried, Eric [indeciphe
rable] who has a Jewi sh French origin. They 
have three children. Darna decided to shift to a ko
sher home, with all my 
credit for that. And her 
children are going to Jewi sh day sc
hool in -- in Ne w Ha mpshire, and get a very solid Jewish 
education, a very solid secular 
education. I™m very proud, we just
 had the Bat Mitzvah of the 
older one, Sa rah, who has the name
 of my firstwife, S-Stella. 
Q: Stella. 

A: Stella. So she is Sarah [indecipherable] 

Q: They go to Jewish day school in
 New Ha mps hire, or New Jersey? 
A: In -- sorry, New Jersey -- 

Q: Aha. 

A: -- did I say New Ha mpshire? 

Q: You said New Ha mps hire. 

A: Sorry, no, New Jersey. 

Q: It™s all right. 

A: In Englewood. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
105 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: There are Jewish schools, and all -- they ar
e, all three of them, Sarah, Rebecca and Alana, and 
going to the same  Jewish school in -- in New 
Jersey. And they learned Hebrew, they were 
wonderful Bat Mitzvah, in which again we talk
ed about family and so on. And my son and 
[indecipherable] she™s a physician, 
my son went to me dical school, 
too, he is a anesthesiologist. 
Of course, he™s the vice president of the anes
thesiology group in [indecipherable] if you ever 
need some body. 

Q: Okay. I™ll reme mber that. 

A: Re me mb er. But he is a very good physician in 
general and an excellent
 anesthesiologist. He 
establish his fa mily, his wife La
uren is a psychiatrist, a very good one, they have two children, 
wonderful, delightful children, Evan and Dylan, w
ho -- whom I see -- you know, close, they live 
three blocks -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- from my house, and a -- av -- a very happy 
fa mily, and we are very thankful to -- to our 
faith, for our faith and what happened. 
Q: Right. Well, Mi chael, I thank you so very mu
c h for being willing to take so much time in 
telling us what™s a very moving and I know 
very difficult story for you to be telling. 
A: Yes, it is a difficult story, I thank you for 
your patience, and prompting and good questions 
and keeping so well, track. I think it™s importa
nt that that story be known because it has -- you 
know, it™s lifes, individual life™s which interfere 
with history in crucia
l juncture mo ments of 
history, which therefore indivi
dualized ma y -- in happening, ma
y become  more relevant for 
broader purposes of identity or  of faith, of histor
y, of social change, political change . So I™m glad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
106 
 
that you invited me  to put on the 
record those things, and I hope
 that my children children™s 
children and so on will so me time also see that video, you and me  talking, and -- 
Q: I hope so -- 

A: -- and they will know what is the hi story behind that. 

Q: Right, thank you. 

A: Thank you, thank you very much. 

Q: Thank you again. 
End of Tape Eight

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: And who  is this? 
A: This -- the picture of my great
 grandfath -- parents. This is -- 
the lady™s name  is Cha ya. The 
ma n™s na me  is Ushar. Chaya is the mother of my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein. And 

this picture was taken apparent
ly about exactly a century ag
o in 1905, or ma ybe 1906 because 
the family™s story is that  they left  Balti at  that  
age in that state. Apparently they were above 70 or 

even more, deciding to leave their family behind 
and going to the Holy Land to die there and to 
be buried in the Holy Land. And lo and behold, 
they had the courage, the stamina, and the 
strength, to accomplish that dream, a nd left 
Balti in 1906 or 1907. Finally they arrived in 

Jerusalem. I don™t know how they did it, becaus
e they spoke only Yiddish and ma ybe  a bit of 
Russian and they had to travel, of cour se, by horse
, and by cart until they got to the train and then 
from the train they should have crossed the sea byboat, and then to arrive, but they ma de it. And 

they arrived in Jerusalem, lived Maya Sharim. 
As you can see he™s -- has a beard, and has payas 
and the --  the traditional caftan. And my mother
 and I visited the cemetery in which we knew 
that they were buried. And that 
was still during my mother™s life,
 and my  mother discovered in 
the books their name s. And we found their -- he
r grave in the cemetery 
of Jerusalem on the 
Mount of Olives. We  didn™t find Ushar™s gr ave 
because Ushar grave was desecrated by the 
Jordanians when they controlled that part of Je
rusalem. Last year I spent six weeks in Jerusalem 
at the Hebrew University, and I went back to re
trieve the -- the grave of my great gr eat great-
grandmother. So fi -- I did find it, cleaned the -- 
the gravestone, her name  is there, exactly when 
she died, and I brought the pictures back to my gr
andchildren. I would hope 
to get there with my 
grandchildren so they get a tangible sense of her
itage, of -- of fa mily history. And I still try to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
108 
 
fi nd out, to construct the full fa mily tree, which --  
for which I have a lot of data, but I have to put 
it on a good chart.  
Q: And this group? 

A: This picture is real historic 
picture, is a pi cture of the synagogue of Ba lti be fore the war, when 

the synagogue was -- is -- it st
ill existed. People attended th
e service and some body t ook that 
picture which some how arrived in 
my mother™s hand and she saved it through the entire ordeal of 
my fa mily lifes until -- then brought
 it to the United States. So he
re in that picture you can see 
my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, whosename  is carried by my  brother Zolly, as an 

old ma n there. And two of his sons, who are my 
mother™s cousins and my uncles. This is Uncle 
Yosl on the extreme right of the picture and Uncl
e Shrul, a bit younger. So the others -- I know 
some na mes  from my mother, but 
they are not relatives. But we
 are very proud to have this 
picture. But I like to say that 
I was very gratified realizing at
 my granddaughter™s Bat Mitzvah 
that all my grandchildren were extremely happy a
nd proud to have their pictures of their family 
tree, counting themselves as the sixth generation 
down from Haier Faerstein. So this great great 
great-grandmother, that ma de the m very happy a
nd very proud. So I am very proud of them, too. 
We have other pictures fu
rther, if you want to look. 

Q: Yes [indecipherable]
. And this picture? 
A: This picture is my grandparents on my mothe
r™s side. It is Zollman 
Mayhel Faerstein, the ma n 
whom you s a w in the prior picture in the synagogue
, the elderly gentlema n. This is shortly after 
my mother was born. In the picture is also my 
grandmother, Brana -- Brana Baratz Faerstein, and 
her little daughter Shanya, or Seindel Faerstei
n. She™s barely one year old, and the picture 
apparently was taken at the same time with the 
initial pi ct ure when the family went to the only 
photographer in town, because the 
-- the parents, Chaya and Ushar 
decided to leave the country, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
109 
 
so they ma de pictures. Zollman Mayhel is alread
y the father of six children before my mother. 
And you can see he is still l
ooking as a young -- relatively yo
ung ma n. For Brana, his second 
wife, this is the only and fi rst child -- the fi rs
t child and the only child, Shanya. This is how 
fa milies were at that time. 
Q: And this picture? 

A: In this picture you can see my other grandparen
ts, on my father™s side. This is Itic Catz, or 
Itac Catz, and his wife Ava, or Chava, of whom
 I -- whom I both mentioned in -- in the prior 
narrative of my life. They were in Roma n. He was 
a -- a s -- a very small shopkeeper, is a grocer. 
They were rather poor. My other grandparent
 in the prior picture had a workshop producing 
soap, also very artisanal thing. But as you can see, he was also very distinguished in his looks, 

with a very respectable beard. Kind of stiff in 
the picture, unusual for him to be photographed. 
His wife Chava is the person w
hom I  described to you as my grandmother who was rather short 
and heavy. You can see that he is 
sitting and she is standing and th
ey are almost the same  height, 
because she wasn™t very tall and she grew bi
gger. The young ma n there is my father at a young 
age. He was in his teens, I believe; my fa
ther, Marcu Catz. I believe he was ma ybe 16 - 17, 
because hi s brother, Bernard, my 
Uncle Bernard is not in the pict
ur e, otherwise he would have 

been in the pictur e. The reason he
 is not is that he had to leav
e the town in which they left , 
Roman, because he was -- he got involved in some 
political activities a bit of the left, and he was 
badly beaten up and threatened. We  have some  pi
ctur es in the fa mily of
 his being bitten -- I 
mean, the wounds he -- he endured in that beating 
and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left -- 
had to leave with his left  leanings to Paris, wh
ere he could practice them a bit more. And then he 

left France for Canada where he established a fam
ily, but ma rried in the t
ypical Jewish way with 
a girl he me t on the boat, and established the fa
mi ly. He™s had one son, Ch
arlie Kent, my cousin, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
110 
 
who established a very beautiful
 family, the Kent fa mily with four children in Toronto and 
Phoenix and the States. Many gran
dchildren. Charlie married -- marri
ed Ida, who is still alive. 
My uncle -- Charlie Kent passed away, but they 
helped decisively in the -- in taking out my 
brother Zolly from Romania. In fact, ransomi
ng him with mo ney from the govern -- Ro mania™s 
governme nt, and this is how Zolly and his family
 arrived in Ca nada. But Bernard, unfortunately, 
is mi ssing from this picture. 

Q: Right [inaudible] 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And who ™ s this? 

A: This is my grandmother, again on the mother™s
 side. I called her Babba Brana, this is Brana 
Baratz Faer st ein, and the little pers
on over there is me . That -- there 
is an inscription on the back 
of the picture which shows that at that ag
e I was 11 months old. Bu
t you can see that my 
grandmother still looked very -- was a very beau
tiful -- the very beautiful woma n she was here, 
with -- with white hair. In the earlier pictur es with
 my mother at that age, she had hair was still 

dark and black. Young and beautiful and now she has 
-- that is what, about 30 
years later, or so.  
Q: And here? 

A: Here are my two grandmothers. On the right th
ere is Babba Brana, yes, who is my mother™s 
mother, and on the other side is Babba Ava or Ch
ava, who was my father™s mother. They were 
with us in Iasi. This is a picture taking -- taken 
just about a year after th
e -- before the beginning 
of the war. The front person is -- small baby is
 my brother Zolly, and 
I am hiding behind him, 
showing only my head. Zolly this age had -- abou
t 15 months or so, the grandmothers are both 
very proud and keep a very possessive hand on him,this was the latest sign of the fa mily. And 

this is a very happy pictur e because it™s a fi
rst -- the last pictur e I have  with both my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
111 
 
grandmothers in the same picture. When the war started, they didn™t ma ke pictures any more. 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Okay, go ahead. 

A: What you can see now is the ye
llow star, the fa mous yellow st
ar which the Jews from several 
parts of Roma nia were forced to wear. That part
 included Iasi. And that 
was the star I had, in 
fact, the st ars were circulating in the fa mily be
tween me  and my father. They had to be sewn on 
our garments whenever we went out. They -- if y
ou use the same gar ment it stays the same, but if 

we change the garment we cannot go outside without
 the yellow star. So my mother saved two of 
our yellow stars. One of them is in the Jewish mu seum in -- Holocaust mu seum in Ne w York, 

this is the second and I -- I -- that was my own and my father™s, for some  t i me . For -- 

Q: And did you -- did you have to purc
hase these, or were these home ma de? 
A: No, no, they were handma de by each family and 
this is why you have also variety. They were 
sewn in the house out of yello
w fabric and black fabric. 
Q: And the pens are for scale? 

A: And the pen is in for scale, and you can see ho
w it was. In fact, we had in our home , a sewing 
machine, and that was used; I remembered how it 
looked, and it used for ga
rment too, cause at -- 
every family sew a lot of garments at that 
time fo r themselves. But it --  it was used to 
ma nufacture our yellow stars. 

Q: And wha t  are these docume nts right here? 

A: These are documents from 1942, in the height 
of the Holocaust period. The first one is an 
order which my father received from the military
 authority of Iasi for the commandant -- you 
know, the commander of the military authority, to be 
on call, to be ready that he is going to be 

called for duties, unspecified, and he should be re
ady any time such call will be made. It will be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
112 
 
communicated loudly and he™s bound to come  to th
e address me ntioned in 
the order, under sever 
-- severe penalty. It™s also indica
ted that he was allocated to be
 a me mbe r  of a -- a labor team 
number 38, to be led by another Jewish ma n na
me d Kaufma n, Yuda. His name  was also written 
there. The name of my father is
 up there, Marcu L from Leib, Catz
. The --  the threat  was terrible 
because it does not -- it did not 
specify what will happen to them. Other Jews from Iasi received 
the same order, and the fear was that this is a sy
stematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill 
them. Indeed then it was -- became  known that 
they have to pr esent themselves, the specific 
place was the railway station, exactly the same st
ation where the Jews in the -- were put on the 
death train. So then my father was infor med that
 he has to be present at a certain day there, 
together with other Jews. And with fear in hi
s heart, he ha d to go. The bureac -- and he  went. 

Fortunately we saw him back. But this second do
cume nt is the certificat
e which the military 
bureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof 
that he indeed responded to the call and was 
there. That was important document too, to prot ec
t him from the accusation that he did not show 
up. So this our fa mily document saved. There were 
more like that, but not all were sa -- saved.  
Q: And wha t  is this? 

A: This is a document about myself. I believe 
I mentioned earlier that
 in 1942, the Roma nian 
governme nt decided to ma ke a full census of 
the Jewish population and they asked the 
Federation of Jewish Communities to do that. It 
was called the Center Or ganiza tion of the Jews. 
Whatever the name  -- Centrala Evreilor din Romania.
 So again we got extremely afraid that the -
- the census of all Jews is being ma de to keep
 good track of where they are and who they are, 
when the decision will be ma de that they could 
be picked up and -- and some thing done not very 
good to them. So this card however, is also ve ry im
portant historical document because it™s -- it™s 
blunt, it say, this is a census -- Recensami ntul
 locuitoriln cu ringelv
reese. The census for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
113 
 
inhabitants having Jewish blood. I mean, this is -- 
they were not mi ncing words. The ethnic bias 
is clear, blood bias. You have Jewish blood, you ar
e a different category of person. The name  is 
there, Catz, Moise, my name , our address, Iasi, 
street Colonel Langa, tracepervachi, which is 13. 
My fa -- because I was a mi nor in 1942, my father a
nd that -- June ™42 is 
mentioned there as the 
date, my fat her has to put his identity number on 
the left side of the card. Now, on the back of the 
card, you can see two stamps. One is the -- the stam
ps of the  Iasi police, 
and the other one is -- 
the first one is the Iasi police 
with the crown of the king over th
ere you can see in the first. And 
the second is the stamp of the Jewish community 
of Iasi, giving authenticity to this docume nt. 
Q: And this document? 
A: This document is something -- is a gift  which I received fr om the Jewish community of Balti 

in 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of bi
rth, simply to see how it looked at that time . I 
was on a World Bank mission to Moldova for 
developing programs  whic h the bank was 
developing for Moldova, in my capacity the senior 
advisor at that time  at the bank for social 
policies. I also spoke the language of course, so
 I went on that mi ssion, an
d I took a few days off 
fr om the work problem to be able to visit my 
town, Balti. At that time I wanted to see the 
synagogue in which my -- my grandfather was pray
ing in his time, but it had been destroyed long 
before by the war, and very little was left from 
Balti -- from past Balti. So I was told however 
that the new synagogue was created in a home,
 which was built like a usual home, a dwelling, 
but in -- it™s used as a synagogue and was take
n there. And then I saw there indeed, in ™94, 
through the people who are living in 
Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in
 a -- in a Saturday morning, 
with a full service done as -- by 
usual service. My leader, th-t
he person who brought me  there 
was my cousin, first cousin, 
Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I me ntioned before, who was 
living with his family still at that time in 
Balti, in ™94. He took me  to the synagogue and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
114 
 
explained to me  -- I -- I wanted to have some
 kind of me mor y and I asked whether I can have 
something from that -- they say we cannot give
 you any sidur, because we have very little 
sidurim, there are not enough, we don™t have any ot
her items. But I notice in that corner, some  
cardboards with some  inscriptions. I say, ﬁWhat are these? ﬂ They
 say, ﬁWell, these are things 
which we had to write when we opened up -- came 
back from -- from the camps and there were a 
lot of people who died in the camps, and those 
who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after 
them, pray. But they didn™t know to the Kaddish, 
the Hebrew Kaddish words. So we had to write 
the Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- 
with Cyrillic letters 
so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic 
letters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. At that
 time  we wrote -- we 
created the black -- the 
cardboards, and these are some  of
 them.ﬂ On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word 
from Kaddish, the dollit is mi ssing. Only k-u then 
sheen. On the left hand corner is Kaddish the 
same  word with Cyrillic letters, and then the wh
ole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter . [speaks 
Hebrew] ________  and so on. And this is a prayer
 which Jews from all the entire world are 
saying in the me mory of those whom they lost. It
 was very mo ving to me  to see that -- that 
document, historic document i mprovised, a pro
duct of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed 
because of the Holocaust , who will -- had to 
be ma nufactured by hand because there was no 
prayer books. And I ask whether I 
can have at least one of them 
to me. They said you can have 
them all because by now we have [indecipherable]
. And they ended up giving me  three of them. 
So I brought them with me . One is this one, an
other one is in the Holocaust museum i n New 
York. The third one is with me  
still, waiting if your Holocaust museum, Joan, want to exhibit it, 
I™m happy to -- to gi ve it there. It is extremel
y meaningful for me  because it is from t he same  
town I was born and from the synagogue, but I belie
ve it™s meaningful for 
the entire history of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0495  
115 
 
what the Holocaust me a n -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for 
those whom they lost. 

Q: Okay, and this? 

A: This is a plaque, a me morial plaque which 
my mother commissioned after she arrive d in the 
U.S. to -- for the me mory of those in the family
 who died during the Holocaust and for the other 

people in the fa mily who passed away. She donated th
e mo ney for planting trees in Israel in their 
me mory, and then ordered this plaque and she™s -- it
™s written there, this garden of trees in Israel 
is in honor of the fa milies Faerstein, Catz and 
Baratz, the families which I me ntioned, ma de by 
Shanya Faerstein Catz. In parenthesis, Buchika 
which is a nickname  whi c h the small kids a -- 
you know, gave to her, my kids gave to my mot her
, Buchika, and this is how she was left in our 

fa mily. And on the left hand side there are 
the name s of people who died in norma l 
circumstances before, or ma ybe after the Ho
locaust, but not in camps. It includes my 
grandfather, my grandmother a
nd so on. Some  of them were in
 the Holocaust, my father, 
including my late wife, Stella Ya
vetz Catz Cernea. On the right 
hand side are the names of many 
of those who died in Transnistria, I mean in th
e -- in the former Bessarabia, Balti and the other
