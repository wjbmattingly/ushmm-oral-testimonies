Des Moines
,
 Iowa
. This 
conversation is being taped over th e phone. 
Fred
, can you tell me where and when  
you were born, and your 
name at birth, please? 
Answer: I was born in 
Vienna
,
 Austria
, at that time an independent country , on 
November the 23
rd
, 1923. 
Q: Thank you. And your name was? 

A: My name was the same, except 
I changed my first name; it was 
Fritz
, andwhen I 
came to the 
United States
, it was changed to 
Fred
. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Otherwise we Œ all names are the same, 
l-o-r-b-e-r
. 
Q: Thank you. And can you tell me where 
and when  your parent
s were born, along 
with their names? 

A: Yes. My father was born in 1898 in 
Nadwo r na
, which is a small town in western
 
Poland
, and he left there just at the beginnin
g, or before the start of World War I, 
and emigrated to 
Vienna
. My mother was born of five
 children. Excuse me, my dad 
was of Œ was one of tw o ch ildren Œ two or th
ree, and I don™t quite recall. My mother 
was one of five, and sh
e and her parents left 
Belz

Poland

under the govern ing ship of 
Austria
 at that time, before the first W o rld War, and 
when  the war broke out, my  grandfathe
r apparently had a general store in 
Belz
, and 
they buried all their merchandise, because 
they felt that the war would be taking 
place where they lived, and th
ey went on to the west, 
and they ended up with 
relatives in 
Budapest
 for a very short time; th en emigrated to 
Vien na 
at the 
beginning of Wo rld War I. 
Q: How old were your parent
s around one Œ World War I? 
A: My parents were in their late 30s. Excu
se me, when Œ you mean when they left? 
Q: Wh-When they got to 
Vienna
. 
A: They were very young. I 
think Œ well, 1914 wh en th e 
war broke out, so they were 
either 16 or 17 years old. 

Q: And how did they meet? 

A: That is a puzzle. I don™t know. I 
think that the Jewish population of 
Vienna
 was 
pretty large. I think the city itself was 
Œ had a population of about two and a half 
million, and about 200,000 were Jewish. A
nd so apparently the people that came 
from the same areas in the Œ eastern 
Euro pe
, because the 
Hapsburg  
Empire at that 
time was really large, before the first Wo
rld War, and en comp assed mu ch of western 
Poland
, and 
Czechoslovakia
 and went as far as down 
to north ern Œ what later 
became northern 
Italy
. And so there was a lot  of so
cial activity going on, and I

really don™t quite know how they really met.
 All I knew that I was a child that really 
be Œ that came in 1923, so the war was ove
r in 1918, so this was a very difficult 
economic time, and I Œ not very  mu ch was 
tal k ed about on ho
w th ey met, and I 
really never found out. 

Q: Did they speak Œ 

A: I should have been 
much more inquisitive. 
Q: What Œ what language did 
th ey speak with each other? 
A: They spoke German and Yiddish. And my
 Œ I think they both
 knew some Polish, 
but I don™t think Œ think Œ because thei
r schooling both  was done in  ger Œ in 
German, because I think that 
the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as 
where they lived. And most of
 the Jewish populations in 
these small cities, either 
had a 
chayder
, which was a religious school, wher
e things were taught in Hebrew 
and in Yiddish. And then I think there was 
another school that I attended, wh ich was 
in German. 
Q: What kind of Œ o-obvi
ously they were Jewish, what kind of religious 
backgrounds did they have? Did th
ey have different tradition Œ 
A: Ah, it was Orthodox. 

Q: Both of them? 
A: Semi-Orthodox. Modern Orthodox.

Q: Mod-Modern  Orthodox? 
A: Yeah, I guess. 

Q: Did Œ did they keep a di
fferent religious life as adu
lts than they  had Œ had as 
children? 

A: Yeah, we joined a synago
gue in Œ when I grew up. A
nd I think th at was rather 
late. At that time there we
re small, and I think it th
en continued also in the 
United 
States
, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts,
 which functioned at
 high holidays, and 
a rabbi somehow, he was Œ had another job, 
and th en he conducted
 services at Rosh  
Hashanah  and Yom Kippur; the two, you 
know, very important Jewish holiday s. 
And they were sometimes held at a store
front. But we belonged to a conservative 
synagogue in 
Vienna
 when  I was growing up. I don™
t know what the sh Œ really 
religious affiliations were before I was bor
n. I just never really Œ was so, I guess 
involved with the pr
esent time, an d changes that took
 place culturally, and language-
wise, and new locations, and all the things
 that took place that I think that the 
inquisitiveness was not there to find out how 
all these things really came to be.  
Q: Sure. Did your father serve in World War I? 
A: Beg your pardon?

old when  the war broke Œ th
e war broke out in 1914 Œ 
Q: ™14? 
A: Œ and he was born in 80 ni Œ in
 ™98, so, he was 16 years old.  
Q: Mm-hm. And he Œ 
A: And I don™t think he was an aus Œ I thi
nk he was a Polish citizen rather than an 
Austrian one, they

A: Œ became later. So, he was not drafted. 

Q: I see. Did they sp eak 
German with you at home Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ or you were just Œ German? 

A: German. 

Q: Did you know Yiddish at all? 
A: Somewhat, yes. Not very well, but 
they did speak Yiddish and German and 
sometimes fall into Polish
, but not very often. 
Q: What part of 
Vienna
 did you live in? 
A: In the 20
th
 district, which was a Œ 
Vienna
 had 21 districts, th
e first district was 
the inner city, where all the 
[indecipherable]
 build ings, mu seums, and th e opera

and all the public buildings we
re and the Œ was in central 
Vienna
, and it Œ ev en 
though it was the 20
th
 district, it Œ it joined the s
econd district, which was very Œ it 
had a very  substantial Je
wish population. The 20
th
 district also had a good size Œ 
well, not so 
[indecipherable]
 but had a sprinkling of Jewish population. And it was 
next to th e second district and the first di
strict. So, it was pretty close within the 
inner city, even though
 the numbers really 
were the disparity.  
Q: What kind of socio-econo
mic groups lived there? Wa
s this a mi ddle class, a 
merchant Œ 
A: Middle class. I would say middle class.  

Q: And what Œ what was your
 Œ did Œ did both of your 
parents work, or only your 
father? 
A: No, my mother never work
ed. My father work
ed for a fairly larg e manufacturing 
company of textiles, w ho had plants in 
Czechoslovakia
. They  made tablecloths and 
towels and other linens, and their head
quarters was in the first district in 
Vienna
, 
and he was one of the sales Œ started out 
as one of the salesmen, later became th e 
sales manager for the company for 
Vienna

 I remember the address. 
Q: Oh, go ah ead, give us the address. 
A: It was on 
Rudo lfpla t z
(ph) and at least the significant, it stands out in my  mind, 
because the Gestapo later on was kind of cattycorner from Œ there™s a square, they 

were on a kind of a small square, if I re
member, with trees, and some Œ a few 
benches, and diag Œ di
 Œ dial Œ diagonally 
Œ diagonally? Right. 
Q: Yes. 
A: There was a hotel, kind of a meet Œ it wa sn™t a luxury hotel, but it was a Œ it was a 
good sized hotel called the 
Metropole
 Hotel, which later became the 
SS 
headquarters and the Gestapo headquarters for Œ for 
Austria
. And I™ll refer to it later 
on, because it did play a part in our lives. 

Q: Okay . Do  you have a sense Œ do you recal

just the years that your fath

now the beginning and the end 
of the Œ 
A: That™s Œ I think Œ I can
 only give you a rough Œ 
Q: Sure. 
A: Œ estimate on that. I think he started 
work ing th ere at the end of Œ or the 
beginning of peace, 1919 or
 1918, and then became 
the sales manager, as I 
mentioned before, I think, fo r the 
Œ for the company, for the city of
 Vienna

Q: Okay. Were you born
 an Austrian citizen? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . So  your parents would have hadAustrian citizenship  by the time you were 
born? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. Can you describe a little bit ab
out your childhood memories of school, 
school friends? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Was it an integrated  group, did you go to a Jewish school? 

A: Yes. I went to Œ the first part I went to called a 
Volksschule
, which is first fo ur 
grades, and did very  Œ from what I understa
nd, I did very well. Not because I was so 
smart, but I think the competition wasn™t
 very great Œ it was in a neighborhood 
school, in a very traditional school buildin
g. It was, as a matter of fact, when I 

visited 
Vienna
 later on, it was still there, and I Œ really, I think I was a little bit of 
teacher™s pet, because my parents always
 got very good reports. I don™t quite 
reme mb er the names of the teacher, but there was a close relationship. In other 

word s, a respect between my  parents and th
e teachers of that school, and I did come 
out pretty well academically. 

Q: And this was a public school?

A: It™s a Œ no, it™s a sc Œ well, yes, it was a p ublic school, this one was. 
Q: Right. 

A: From there I went to gymnasium, which 
is a kind of semi-private, or it was really 
the track up to th
e university. And Œ 
Q: Do you recall which one it 
was? The name of the school? 
A: Yes, 
Ul-Ultaberg
(ph) gymnasium. It was named af
ter the street it was on, it was 
next to a very large well-known park called the 
Augarten
, and it wasn™t very far 
away from where we lived; I w
ould walk to  school. I took a Œ used  to take me about 
probably  25 or 30 to  30 fo Œ 
maybe 40 minutes, every day. 
Q: And the school 
did not have a relig
ious denomination? 
A: They had a religious Œ they had a Œ Cat
holics had a priest come  in and the class 
was separated at that time, twice a week
, I think, maybe an hour each time. The 
same thing, we had a Jewish rabbi that
 came in, the students would be pulled out, 
the Jewish students, and took religious in-ins
truction. I think that still is the German 
way of doing things, I 
think they still do that. 

Q: Do you recall Œ sorry Œ do you recall 
how many Jewish students went to your 
grade? 
A: Yes, my  class had a number of Jewish
 students, because the neighborhood, you 
know, where we lived did not have many Je
wish people, but there were maybe three

to four families on one large city block, 
or a couple of city
 blocks. And further 
[indecipherable]
 one fur-further toward 
the center of the city, the Jewish population 
became mu ch larger. So, we did have an 
Œ quite a good part, I 
would say 30 percent 
of the students mu st have been Jewish. 
Q: Now what years Œ 

A: The boys were separated from the girl
s, and I mentioned before th at a rabbi 
would co me in twice Œ I think once or tw
ice a week, and the Jewish students would 
be separated again, and would take Jewish instruction. 

Q: And now wh at years were you at the gymnasium? 

A: What year was I 
at the gymnasium? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Ah, let™s figure that out. Had to be from 
1930 f Œ let™s see, I was b o rn in ™23, so 
six Œ four Œ in 10 years, when I was 10 or
 11 years old, I went
 on to gymnasium 
from 
Volksschule
. So I would assume I 
mu st have been  11.  
Q: Okay, so isn™t that 1934? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. And you were at
 the gymnasium until when?

A: No. It™s an eight year cour Œ it™s an eight year Œ 
Q: Eight years, okay. 
A: Yes, so I did the first four years. 

Q: First four. So 1934 through 1938. 

A: That is Œ so 1938, and when  the Nazis 
took over in March of 1938, by May they 
told us the Jewish students 
could no lo nger go to any pu
blic or semi -private school 
in Œ in 
Vienna
. 
Q: Okay , now I Œ 

A: And I got kicked  Œ in other word

Q: Okay. Now da Œ I Œ I just 
want to go back a little bit Œ 
A: Sure. 
Q: Œ to the 30s. Do  you have Œ do you ha

 Do you have any 
memo ries of your parents discussing th e Nazi party™s rise to power in 
Germany
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And what are those? 
A: The Œ it™s Œ what stands out in my  me
mo ry, and it sometimes fades out, but I still 
reme mb er, in 1938 Œ January  of 1938, at 
that time the German and Au strian schools

had a winter vacation. In 
Austria
, their national sport is 
skiing, and soccer. And I 
was just Œ I was put on skis at only six years old. So , I was with my  school on a 
winter vacation at Œ at some of the mountains, the 
[indecipherable]
 kind of not the 
Alps
, but kind of the foothills of the 
Alps
 for one week  with my  school, skiing Œ for 
a skiing vacation. And it was Œ had to be
 January of 1938. 
I still remember it 
because I wa Œ I participated in a ski ra
ce, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I 
was very proud of it, and I Œ but by the s
econd run or whatever it is, I ken Œ I had a 
bad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of 
dislocated my  thumb, and I reme mb er that. 
So, wh en  my  parents picked me up at the 
railroad station, co ming back from that 
school vacation, they seemed at edge, an
d explained to  me that things were not 
doing very well. They had recei
ved information and in cont
act with some friends or 
relatives in 
Germany
 Œ and as you know, 
Hitler
 took over 1933, and at that time, 
the 
Nuremberg
 laws, which this qualified and 
you know, makes the Jews of 
Germany
 not only second class, but third and 
fourth class citizens and they lost 
their jobs, particularly if they were gove
rnment jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies, 
or livit Œ or publishing and things like th
at, the discrimination really was beginning 
to really hurt in 
Germany
, and my parents were very much
 aware of it. So when I di 
Œ they picked me up and I still remember th
ey picked me up at 
a Œ at the railroad 
station and on th e way home 
were telling me what was 
going on politically in

Austria
 at that time. A nd it was, if you go b
ack into history, th
ere was a chancellor 
of 
Austria
, his name was 
Schuschnigg
, and he represented the Œ kind of a little bit 
of a also Œ I would say little bit a of a dict
atorship, but not as strongly as what the 
Nazis had. He represented the Christian Au strian Christian party, wh ich was the Œ 
the Conservative party. 
Vienna™s
 representation was mo re social demo cratic, and 
my father was involved in th
e social democratic party. And at that time there were 
all kinds of demonstrations in 
Vienna
. The Nazis had become determined again that 
they were, since 1934 the N
azi party was outlawed in 
Germany
 Œ in 
Austria
, 
because they had tri-tried to have a 
putsch
, and overthrow the 
government. They 
killed 
Dollfuss
, who was a chancellor, in tr Œ in tryi
ng to do it, but that was aborted, 
and the Austrian government was able to 
arrest and Œ and kill some of the people 
who tried to overthrow the government, a
nd this Œ and th at time outlawed the Nazi 
party. So , in 1938, the beginning, the nego
tiations were going on between the pr Œ 
the president of 
Austria
 and 
Hitler
. He would summon him Œ 
Hitler
 would 
summon him to 
Berchtesgaden
 and really threaten him w
ith all kinds of bad things, 
and scream at him, and was looking to annex 
Austria
 to 
Germany
. And the guy 
stood firm, 
Schuschnigg 
did, for a while. So all this
 demonstration of voting for 
annexation to 
Austria
, o r  
Austria 
re-remaining independent, took place in the 
beginning of 1938. Some of the negotia
tions that took place which Œ in 
Austria

Germany
, that 
Austria
 submitted to 
Germany
, and let some people, Nazis, out of 
prison, and Œ and also appointed them to
 certain key jo bs w
ithin the Austrian 
government. 
Seyss-Inquart
 was one of them, and I don™t quite rememb er what 
names of the other people that became 
like th e commissioner of
 safety, and so me 
other tr Œ cabinets Œ j-jobs, and it really
 did not look very well for the independen ce 
of 
Austria
 at that time. I know a lot of street 
demonstrations in which my  father had 
participated. 
Q: Do you recall Œ  
A: So they were telling me this whole st
ory, what was going on at that time. 
Q: Do you recall what
 they were saying? 
A: What they were doing? They Œ

A: Good question. Let me just think fo
r a minute. There were occasionally so me 
word s thrown, anti-Semitic, you know, about
 Jews, but not too much, because many 
of my friends were non-Jewish, even thou
gh I had my  Œ I also had two cousins to 
whom I was very close, my mother™s sister
™s sons. And one was 
same age as I, and 
one was a year and a half younger. And they
 were very di Œ th
ey, at very young, 
were very involved in 
Hashomer Hatzair
, which was a left wing of the Zionist 
movement in 
Austria
. And I used to also belong 
to th at youth group. I™d go 
occasionally. I wasn™t this vehement about 
it that Œ as my two cousins, to whom I 
was very close. And we would someti
mes walk togeth er. And I don™t quite

did not live where I lived. So
 there was one or two Jewish, I think one that I was 
close to. I still rememb er his name, 
Leo Schickler
(ph), and we were kept at home 
tha-that day. So , things changed very rapidl
y. I was told that our school would stop; 
Jewish kids would no lo nger go to school 
after summer vacation. I mean, July, we Œ 
we were all kicked out. At Œ what happ

immensity of the political change really did 
move very fast, but it was not at that to 
Œ time, life threatening. It wasn™t a point

was really doing. Well, in the meantime, th

Karl May

the Nazi party. Now, to be a big shot in th

to be an Œ a member 
of the Nazi party for a long time, during th

 So this guy must 
have been Œ for many years b

pleasantly. So we came back, I

him; he had Œ he owned a travel agency . So  Œ and I™m not sure about it, but I think 

this has something to do 
with it. So all this co

appointments were made and Œ now let™s 
see, what did I forget? And there was a 
question about getting a visa 
that was Œ visas sold illega
lly by a embass Œ a Chinese 
embassy official who Œ who wasn™t suppose
d to do it, but sold
 permits to go to 
Shanghai
 fro m 
Vienna
, and also, it was done out of 
Germany
. So  that™s, you 
know, a numb er of people, Jewish people landed up in 
Shanghai

out they  were Œ they Œ they 
sold  those to make money, and it was not a policy of the

A: For us?

A: I don™t think so, because my mother s
till was dishing out m
oney to people who 
had no money. 

Q: Was this through any organiza
tion, any charitable organization? 
A: It was kind of a unofficial done, you kno
w, that things happened  when  Œ when 
panic strikes, that people find ways of doi
ng th ings. It was not official. I don™t think 
it was an organization like 
HIAS
 or anything like that. Be Œ was that somebody had 
re Œ a relative in Œ in 
New Yo rk
, and Œ who had m
oney, or was willing to help this 
person living in  
Vienna
 who had no money. So they  wo
uld say if Œ if the official 
exchange of marks Œ used to be shillings
 and then it became German  marks, was 
five marks to the d Œ 10 ma rks to the dollar Œ I™ve forgo
tten what the exchange rate 
was, the black market would pa
y 20 marks to a person in Œ in 
Vienna
, instead of 10. 
So it paid for the relative to
 deal to that black market, 
or whatever it was called, to 
that conduit. And so  if you had money and you lived  in 
Vienna
, and you Œ there 
were Jewish people who had no
 money, an d they need  to buy groceries. And they 
had relatives that would give Œ who would 
contribute some money. So that™s why I

 went, back and forth.

Things were really heating up, they  ge-

much more ra-rapidly. Less and less Jewish 
business existed, you know, with graffiti

People lost their fortunes. Rich people

stayed outside the harbor in

A: That™s a good question. I never really

you know, we were immigran

reestablish ourselves. So it 
was either we did it and everybody wo rked , or you ju st Œ you became a dependent Œ 
or even th at not being citizen, I don™t know wh ether or not there was money 
available, like unemployment or things like that, and I don™t think so. So if you 

were going to have your self-respect, a

had to make an honest living, you had to 
go to work. And to get a job, I think my

their English language at that time. And th
ey picked it up, you

certain da Œ I got places, and a list of places 
that we should take over, at which hotel 
we should stay, and some apartments that
 were at one time held by some Nazi 
functionaries, to take over for our inco

to be Œ th at were going into the first occ

but don™t pin me down on it,
 but I don™t quite rememb
