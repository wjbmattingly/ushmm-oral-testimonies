bit about what your  life was  like befor e the war  when you first started s c hool, what your par ents were 
like.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. Life was  pr etty good. My father was  a judge. He had s erved in the Fir st World 
War an
d got the Iron Cr os s  and always  s howed the flag on holidays , even taught m e how to s alute the 
flag.We had a live
-
in m aid. We went to the zoo, vis ited the gr eat gorilla and took  tr ips .
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  You liv ed a good lifes tyle.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yeah. Of c ours e, m y m other was n't J ewis h. I was n't Jewis h. But we s till obs erved 

both holidays . I had the bes t of two wor lds , Chr is tmas and Hanuk k ah, Pas s over  and Easter. That was  

r eally fine.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Suzy Snyder:  Did you
 
--
 
you s aid your  father  was
 
a Fir s tWor ld War veteran, s o he was  a patriotic  
Germ an.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Tell me a little bit about your grandpar ents.What were your  grandpar ents  like, on 

both s ides of the family
?  
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Actually, I never  knew 
m y grandparents.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: Were they dec eas ed? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  They wer e dec eas ed. Actually, to go far ther back, m y one gr andfather  was  a 
c antor, a teac her, and the other  was  a watc h mak er .
 
> > Suzy Snyder: When did you fir s t
 
--
 
you wer e bor n
 
in 1927.
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  Correc t.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Hitler com es  to power in 1933. You're old enough to really unders tand. When did you 
s tart to really under s tand things  were different?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, my father lost his job.
 
> > Suzy S nyd
er :  In 1933.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  1933, los t his  job imm ediately. They told him don't leave the building in front 
bec aus e there's a dem ons tr ation, a Nazi demonstration; leave in the back . Said m y father, "I c am e in 

the fr ont and will leave from  the front." And, of c ours e, immediately we had to m ove to a s maller 
apar tm ent. Money was  v er y tight.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: What did your  father do for m oney, for a living? 
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  He ac tually
 
--
 
fortunately, expens e was  a little bit better bec aus e he s erved in the 
Firs tWorldWar. He gave advic e at the J ewis h 
c
om m unity 
c
enter.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So he c ouns eled people, lived off a pens ion.
 

> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  Of
 
cour s e. My father's c olleagues
 
br o
ught ros es, we ar e s o s orr y, but, of c ours e, 
we c an't have any c ontac t with you anym or e.
 
 
Right now, m y aunt, you s aw, s tood by us, really helped us . And m y m other 's relatives  stood 
by us , too.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  I just wanted to c lar ify. Your Aunt Elfr iede was  not J ewish. She was  your  m other 's  

sister. 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  Correc t.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So s he took  a r isk by helping you.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Absolutely. I remem ber one c as e we m et. She wanted to give m e s om e food. Lo 

and behold, who is  c oming?  One of the Nazi neighbor s. Said, good evening, Mr s.
 
So
-
and
-
s o, he's 
helping m e c ar ry. [Inaudible]
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you'r e going to s c hool. Are you going to public  s c hool s till after 1933?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  1933 I had to go to public  s chool. I was  ver y luc ky. The s c hool I went to was  

not
 
--
 
very few Nazis . The pr inc ipal kept it very c ivil. I must s ay
 
--
 
in s om e s c hools  the J ewis h s tudent 
had to r ec ite patriotic poem s , s ing s ongs , and tr eated quite badly. I was  for tunate.

> > Suzy Snyder:  And did you have other Jewis h friends  who wer e at that s c hool?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes, actually. About thr ee other  J ewis h friends at that s c hool. Corr ec t. But, I must 
s ay, our home r oom teacher , a Party member, tr eated us abs olutely like any other student.
 
> > Suzy S n
yder :  He was  a mem ber of the Nazi Par ty?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. A member of the Nazi Party does  not mean he was  ac tually a Naz i. Example, 
m an [Inaudible], two c hildr en, [Inaudible], he told him , better  join or  no prom otion or you end up 

[Inaudible]. T
he m an was  no her o. But he was  no Nazi. J us t wanted to bec om e m us ic  dir ec tor.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  They jus t wanted to make it through the war .
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. Som e of the wors t people wer e not party m ember s  at all. 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Right. While we'r e talking about that, non
-
J ewis h c hildren als o were Hitler  youth and 
Hitler  maiden. Right?  That was  s omething they had to do?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. They had to join.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So, did you have fr iends  who also turned their  backs on you? 
 

>> 
Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Actually, fortunately the fr iends  I had s tayed with m e. It was  quite c ivil in s c hool. A 
few people, yes , but the pr inc ipal kept it down and I c ould stay there. An influx of r eally rowdy s tudents . 

I dec ide I would leave the s c hool and enter a J ewis h s c hool.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  And how did things  bec om e more diffic ult as  tim e went on?  Could you go to the 

m ovies ?  Could you go shopping? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  It star ted out
 
--
 
s pec ial park  benc hes  for J ews , and then s igns  that J ews  are not 
wel
c om e her e, "J ews  enter this  town at your  own r is k ." But what was  im portant was  the time of the 
Olym pic  Gam es. It all dis appear ed. You c ould go every wher e. All s igns  disappear ed. The moment it 
was  over , the s igns wer e there.
 
And, of c ourse, onc e the war  s ta
r ted, things were getting m or e diffic ult.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So once the war  s tarted. 1939.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Es pec ially r ation, allotm ents . Only allowed to s hop between 4:00
 
and 5:00
 
in the 
after noon, m y m other c ould s hop. A dec ent s hopkeeper , when nobody's  looking, s how me the ration.
 
But, of c our s e, air  r aids  started. I r em ember s itting
 
--
 
ther e was  a room . If the alar m s ounded after 1:00, 
s c hool s tar ted late and c lass es  las ted 35 minutes . I s till s ee m ys elf s itting ther e and hoping, well, I hope 
it wi
ll stop but if it would jus t last five m inutes longer , s c hool
 
--
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Your  m om, through all of this, what was  her  life like?  She obvious ly was  s upportive 
of you, your father. But when s he went out in the street when s he went s hopping, when s he was  able to 
do things , what was  it lik e for  her ?  Did her friends  turn their  back on her ? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Very few friends . J us t s om e, s om e neighbor s you always  have. All in all, we wer e 
fortunate. Of c ours e she helped fr iends.
 
 
Male
 
J ews  had to take the middle name Is r ael. I bec am e Fr itz Isr ael. And the women, Sar ah. 
You 
got the identific ation c ar d, a s pec ial one.When we went to polic e or the gover nm ent offic e, you 
had to r ais e it and s ay in a loud voic e, "I am a J ew." And every signature and regis tration number 

so-
and
-
s o.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So let m e just c larify. In 1938, the Nazis  pas s ed a law s tating that all J ews  had to, as 
Fr itz s aid, take the middle nam e Sarah or Isr ael. And this  was  for the pur pos e of the Nazis  being able to 
be
tter identify you as a Jew. And it was  on ever y doc um ent that you had. 
 
 
So 1940, though, you mentioned 1940, you did have a bar  m itzvah. Didn't you?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Can you talk a little bit about that and what it was  like unde
r the c irc umstanc es ?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, my bar mitzvah, it was  a big s ynagogue, of c ours e. It was  c old. The large 

s ynagogue 
--
 
c ouldn't heat it. But I had the bar mitzvah. It was  41. My father
 
--
 
one of the baker s, they 
went to war together, he was  very nic e. He gave us  s om e c akes and s o on.We wer e lucky.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  How did you learn? Who taught you?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  The s c hool, J ewis h s c hool. And ac tually Germ an s chool ac tually direc ted by the 
Germ an government. Ther e was  his tory, dis c ipline, no s neezing. This  was  not perm itted. No laughing.

And you know?  Ther e is s till one thing I c an't do. I still c an't do this . Why not?  Whenever you did that, 
you wer e as ked, "Going on a tr ip?"  You packed your  hands alr eady. 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  No hands  in the pocket. Right.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Of cour s e, the s c hool in 1942 was  c losed bec aus e the final
 
--
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Solution? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Clos ed bec aus e of the dis s olution of the J ewis h s c hool s ys tem. Then, of c ours e, 

c am e the s tar
 a
nd then the deportation.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Let's  bac k  up and talk  about the im plementing of the wearing of the Star of David. 

How did you feel about having to mark yours elf? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, actually, we have to do it
;  
we do it to m ake the bes t 
of it. It said Jew. Well, I 
was  a J ew. So.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you wore it pr oudly? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, I would s ay.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: What would happen if you didn't wear  the Star of David and they found out you wer e 

a J ew?
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  B
etter not bec ause you might be deported. In fac t, at times , a nasty polic em an, 
oc c as ionally, c ame with a penc il. And if the star was n't fixed tightly, oh my. If he got his pen behind, it 
was  bad.
 
But all in all, actually, people in Berlin, some difficulties  but quite dec ent. In fac t, happened a 
c ouple of times, people gave me s oup or ac tually s om e food. Not ever ybody was  bad.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Right. Well, you did talk  about this  when you wer e m entioning the s lave labor that you 

did. We c an jum p ahead to tha
t if you don't m ind.
 
Your  father and you had to perform s lave labor.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Can you des c ribe what you had to do?  And I'm s orr y, what year ?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  It was  43. Ac tually, the fir s t for c ed labor was  to work in a fac tory.What did we do?  
Ar m am ents for  the polic e. I didn't k now what I was  doing. I gues s  for the Air Forc e, I think. And m y 
father did s om e labor in a factor y. And then later  on, after the Ros enstr ass e, we had to c lean up after 
air  raids
, c
lean the 
s tr eets , tear down the walls , and move
 
--
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  You s ay air r aids  but r eally they wer e bombings. You s ay that after  air r aids you were 
c ons c ripted to c lean the s tr eets . But what you're talking about is  after bombings .
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. After bom bing.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you'r e living in a c ity that's  being bom bed.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  The bom bing would end. 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  And the next m or ning we went to the plac e cleaned up, tor e down the wails , 
whatever  
had to be done.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you were moving building c ons truction.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. Tear down.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  And I'm  s orr y, how old ar e you at this  point? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  16.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  16. And how hard was  the wor k ? 
 
>> F
r itz Gluck stein: Well, it was n't eas y. Injuries. One time a wall c ame down, I los t c ons c ienc e.We 
had a m edic  fixed m e up and then brought m e to a hos pital. It is a Catholic hos pital. And they wer e not 
s uppos ed to tr eat any J ew. But they
 
tr eated m e, sewed
 
m e up, gave m e a tetanus s hot. I s till wonder 
what they put in the rec ord bec aus e they took a ris k  taking c are of m e.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
 
So you m entioned that your  father  als o did s lave labor . He was  in a fac tor y.What kind of 
fac tor y? 
 
> > Fritz Glu
ck s tein:  I don't know.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  At one point he's actually ar res ted.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  The deportation started. In fac t
, 
in s c hool, 
if 
a neighbor was n't there
, yo
u hoped he 
was  s ic k but then you r ealized he was  depor ted.
 
And then one time m y mother ac c ompanied friends  to

the c ollec tion point. Lo and behold, the Gestapo guy, "What ar e you doing
 
her e with the J ews ?  I bet 
you
 
have a J ewis h family . Tom orrow your  hus band and s on ar e going to r eport downtown to a 
c ollec tion point."
 
> > Suzy Snyder: They said this  to your mother? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  My mother . You have J ewis h fam ily, your  family is  going to report tom or row at the 
c ollec tion point. So we did
, d
owntown
 w
e reported. And this  was  under the command of an SS c aptain 
fr om  Vienna. Sitting in room s  of us ually 15 men altogether, J ewis h men. You wer e not perm itted to lie 
down.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  You had to s it there the whole tim e? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  A s tric t order. But the r egular polic emen who guard the building, they c ame around 
and s aid,
 
"Get going, get going. He's  c oming around for ins pection." Rem arkable. Had you been 
c aught, polic e, the eas ter n front.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  He would have been s ent to the eas ter n front?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yeah. There are r isks , too.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  He took  a risk trying to help you.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. Right. And then after a week, half
-
hour downs tair s  for interr ogation. Go 
downstair s . And m y father  and a gentlem an, dis tinguis hed journalis t, prepar ed me. Don't be a her o. 

Don't s how any c ontempt
 o
r h
ostility. Ans wer the question fully but do not volunteer  anything.
 
I get in ther e. Captain was  s itting and tr ied to c atch m e right away. "Ha,
 
your  m other  is J ewis h." "No 
no
," I s aid, "My m other  is Aryan." After  that he ask ed what we wer e doing. 
ﬁ
Ok, now to
m or row you go to 
the labor exc hange; they give you a dec ent job and get out of her e.
ﬂ 
Stepped out. There was  my father. 
And we s tepped out to the s treet to leave. And to date it was  J anuar y
 
24, 1943, my 16th bir thday.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: What was  the back s to
r y to that? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  After  that I went to work  in
 
the factory. And then c ame
 
--
I  
skipped again. Work ed 
in a factor y. Door opens . SS offic er. "Ever ybody out!"  As s em bling outs ide. A tr uck  c am e. We wer e all 

s ent downtown to a dance hall. It was  em pty, old c hair s  and tables . We s at. After hour s or s o, a good 
fr iend of m ine was  inter viewed by polic em an, quite dec ent, s aid get out of here. He let us  go bec aus e 
we both had non
-
J ewis h m other s .
 
We stepped out to the street, 8:00
 
at night, and thereby
 
br ok e the 
law. Ther e was  a c urfew. Nobody had to be out after 10:00
 
at night, the J ews . That was  an offic ial law. 
But if s omebody went to the polic e, I have to vis it my mother at the hos pital; I need perm is s ion to go 

out. Polic e s aid
 
--
 
know about it.
 
 
My
 
friend and I went hom e. My m other  had vis ited an aunt in Siles ia. At the end of the month, 
pic ked up the rations, went to the offic e, was  arres ted, and s ent to another c ollec tion point that happens  

to be the s ynagogue wher e m y bar  m itzvah was . There again, offic er s, the J ewis h c om munity, and the 
Ros ens tr ass e. And ther e was  s itting, again, 12 men in the room, jus t enough to lie down. And ther e we 
were s itting. Spec ulating what would happen to us. And, of c our s e, stand in line for the fac ilities , of 
c our se. 
The building didn't have enough fac ilities  for an influx of many people.
 
 
After a week , downs tairs , r eleas ed. Found m y father . We both had to wait for s om eone, 
s ec r etar y of the c om munity, typed up a s lip. It had to be s igned by the s ergeant. My father  c ome
s. He 

s aid to him , 
ﬁY
ou c ertainly ruined the life of m y people.
ﬂ  
Said my father, 
ﬁ
I hope not.
ﬂ 
And he s tepped 
out. But what we did not know, when we were ins ide, ther e was  a demons tr ation of the non
-
J ewis h 
[Indis c ernible]. They asked for the r eleas e of the
 
hus bands  and c hildr en. The Gestapo, polic e, 
SS

ac c or ding to the diar y of the minis ter of [Indis c ernible], the propaganda, he s aid, well, let's  not 
have unres t r ight now. We c an take c are after. Right after  the battle. And they let us  out.
 
After that th

> > Suzy Snyder:  So you r ealized that your  mother  was  one of thes e people that dem onstrated?

Only onc e.

> > Suzy Snyder:  Tell me about the labor  gangs . What wer e they like? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, we had lawyer s , engineer s . I rem em ber a c hemis t. Don't forget, 16 year s. 
Didn't hear  very m uc h. He taught me s om e words .
 
Lo and behold, I was

How do you

Well, it

it. But if you

we had our  s ack s  and bags r eady. Pr obably would be s ent to

>> 
Suzy Snyder:  Did you know what
 
the east meant?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: We had a pretty good idea. At the beginning, you c ould s end food. You got a 
pos tc ar d, 10 lines . You sent s ome food. It meant [Inaudible]. After a while you didn't get it.We had a 

pr etty good idea what happened. Yes. Didn't know exac tly
 
but we had a good idea.

The mor ning I go to wor k . Up, get her e in the truck . It was  a moving van. Dr ove ar ound. Des tination 
was  Eic hmann's  headquarter s  downtown. I was  luc ky. My imm ediate s uper vis or was  a young 
lieutenant, polite, no remarks . Som e offic er s were ver y nas ty there. But one day we wor ked. "Eic hm ann 

is  c om ing." Ever y J ew knew Eic hm ann was  the dr iving forc e behind the depor tation. They as

how 
would he look .
  
Well, there he c ame
, or
dinar y. Nobody would have notic ed him  in a cr owd. Next to me, 
gives  s om e ins truc tions, and dis appear ed.
 
 
Inter es ting, too, we worked outs ide the building filling up bar rels with our hands. The guar ds  
always  going ar ound. The guards c hange the ever y two hour s . And one guar d always  really behind us.

We took a break . The other guar d I still s ee, little guy, r ed fac ed. Looked at us, never s aid anything. 
Whenever  we took a break , he found s om ething els e to watc h over. He made a point of haras s ing us .

you're s till wor king outs ide?

a
ffect your father ?  How did your  father do in that?

s ee?  Quite a long line of tr ucks pus hed by SS m en.What a s ight. Delightful.

> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  At that point if they have to pus h the m ilitary tr uck s , c om e now. But still, they 
hadn't given up. Suddenly we were taken to a plac e called a new Ber lin after the war . That was  in 
`
44. 
But it was  only a s hort time. Then they s ent us to the s outher n por t to build tank  ditc hes.What did we 
do?  Dug ditc hes and put beams into the ground. We did this  for about 12 hour s . And then we lef
t. And 
then we looked.We s aid, how long would it take the Rus s ians  to get through our wor k? Well, to get out 
it takes  a Rus s ian 31 minutes  to get thr ough. Why?  The tanks would c ome. The c r ews  would laugh for  
30 m inutes . It would take them  one minute to get thr ough. Actually that's  what happened. Bec aus e the 
two Ar mies  appr oac hed. They c ame in s o fas t, the wes ter n par t of Ber lin, les s  str eet fighting, they 
c ouldn't get to the J ews . We had a little part in the liberation of Berlin. Didn't do a ver y good jo

as s ure you.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: What was  it like
 
--
 
des c ribe liber ation, what you felt like at liber ation.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein: Well, I r em ember liberation. It c am e c los e to the end, of c our s e, no mor e r ation. 

You went to a bakery, hoped you would get s om e bread. I went to get s ome br ead, c ame back, and the 
Rus s ian arr ived at the home. Of c ours e, they didn't believe I was n't an SS out of uniform. Fortunately I 
had the s tar and the neighbor  s poke Rus s ian. 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you ac tually needed that s tar
 
s o the Russ ians  knew.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes, yes . They didn't believe who you are.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  It helped pr otec t you s o the Rus s ians  didn't think  that you wer e a Nazi.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Of cour s e.

it was  pr etty r ough. After the war , well, when 
it's over, going after so

c our se, Ber lin was  divided.
 
>> Su

> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Liber ation.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Yeah.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  And always  c ould tell. Food s upply, one m onth was  white bread. The Amer ic ans 

s upplied the food. The next m onth was  dark  br ead, the Rus s ians. 
 
Of c o
urs e, no heat. It was a very 
tough winter .
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Right. Ther e's a war still going on
 i
n other  par ts  of Europe.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Right. Yes . But by that tim e it was  almost over .
 
 
Of c ours e, ever ything froze. There was  no water. So total fac ility froze. People bur ied the 
was te. But you c an imagine what happened in town. You s aw very often people with pac kages, 
depos iting them  in the front yard, in the parks . It was  c old, freezing, fine. When it gets hot, you c an 
imagine what happened.
 
 
Food was  very tough.We m oved to a plac e outs ide Berlin. It was  a hous e. In t
he fr ont we 
planted tom atoes . In the back  we planted potatoes . But then we wer e luc k y, c ame a c ar e package. It 

ever ything from toilet paper  to c igar ettes . And c igarettes , your  new c ur renc y. You c ould buy anything.

Luc ky, Camel, s o on. I rem em ber when we wer e going to c ome over  here, we were told, "Ladies and 
gentlemen, the moment you s tep foot on the boat, remem ber
,  
a c igarette is  jus t a c igar ette."

And s om ething els e
 
in
 
the car e packages

ins tant c offee. You pour . Ther e was  nothing left. Yes . The c are package really helped us .
 

> > Suzy Snyder:  So let m e ask  you a ques tion about getting back on your  feet, your fam ily.
 
Your  father 
went bac k  to work .
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  My father went back to work as  a judge.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  And did you go to s c hool? 
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  I went back  to s c hool. I went bac k  to s c hool after thr ee years . You c an im agine it 

was  quite diffic ult. Again, hom ework and s tudying. And, of c ours e, the s c hool bus ines s . Diffic ult to get 

teac hers who were ex
-
Nazis . But I went back  to sc hool. 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  You and I have talked about you m oving her e. You c ame to the United States but you 

did not c ome with your  par ents. You left them ther e.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  That's r ight.Well, after  a while, things are getting better  but I dec ided, no, thank  

you, I would like to s tay her e. It's not my duty to build Germany. 
ﬁ
Well,
ﬂ 
said m y father, 
ﬁ
if I wer
e 
younger , we c ould both
 
--
 
I would go with you but at my age, what c an I do?  Over  there the law is  
differ ent. It is bas ed on old Englis h law. Here in Ger many it is  bas ed on old Roman law. What c ould I 

do?  Be a laborer?  We stay here. But for  you, the fu
ture is America.
ﬂ 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So they didn't withhold you from  going.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  No. They let m e go. Yes , would rather have you here but your  future is ther e. 
ﬁ
But,
ﬂ  
s aid my father, 
ﬁ
I hope you will c hoos e a profes s ion that is not limited to one c ountr y like law.
ﬂ  
So 
I did.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Did you feel r egret or  a ter rible c onflic t leaving your  par ents ?  You were an only c hild.
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  Yes. Well, I knew it would be diffic ult but had to go ahead.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  And they didn't hold you back .
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  No.
 
> > Suzy Snyder: When did they pas s  away? 
 

> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  They pas s ed later, ac tually. The father was  70. After  I actually had graduated. I 
would s ay this  was  about in the 
`
50s, late 50s or so. They vis ited me ac tually here. I was  s tationed in 
the Arm y her e at Fort Detrick and they c ame and vis ited m e her e.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  So you c ame here. You went into the military. Did anyone know your  s tor y?  Did you 

talk  about it? 
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  A
t the beginning nobody c ared, not at all. Abs olutely not.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Nothing? 
 
> > Fritz Gluck s tein:  No.
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Did they not c ar e or did you not talk  about it?
 
> > Fr itz Gluck s tein:  They knew s om ething. I remem ber it was  a J ewis h holiday, had a party, a 
pie
-
throwing c ontest. You thr ew pies  at the fac e of s omeone. I was  very ups et. How c an you do s uc h?  
They c an be us ed for food. They c ouldn't figure out why I got so ups et. It was  at a J ewis h house, the 

J ewis h s tudent hous e. And a r abbi c ame and explained to them after wards  why I was  s o ups et about it. 
But at the tim e food was  ver y pr ec ious . But in the beginning, nobody c ar ed. 
 
> > Suzy Snyder:  Is there anything that you m is sed about Ger many other than your  par ents  when you 

c am e here? 
 
>> Fr it

good.

But you know, after a week  or 10 days , I c ome home again. Home is  her e.

Don't do to other s what you don't want done to yours elf. And do it now. Don't put it off. Don't wait for  the
