A.  Right.  And they

Q. Let's talk sort of ta

e period before the Ghetto
, okay?  Were you aware ,  
be for e t he  war, what  was  goi ng on i n Ger ma n y?  
A. Very little.  Very little. 

Q.  Onc e  y o u were occ u pied  b y th e Ger ma ns , t h

non-Je wi sh people  --  

A.  Right. 

Q. -- were they s
till your friends after 
the Germans came in?  
A. Some.  Some.  I 
want to say some thing.  Th
e villages know what's goin
g on.  There was already 
Poland fall down so far.  Wh en
 a Jewish family
 went to the villages, an
d they, I give you money 
hidi ng us, peopl e hiding.  How long you give t h e m mo
ne y, t hey tri ed to hide .  After this, t he y no 
hide any of you, and then
 you must go.  There wa
s some villages we
nt to the German
, Polish people  
and t he y would s ay, list e n, here and 
here i s a hidi ng fa mi ly or  a sing
le .  Ger man give, of cours e, t o 
kill the Jewi sh people fr om t he reli gi ous, and th
e peopl e what was hi ding, 
t hey r ecei ve, the Ger man 
deci de t o kil l  the m bec aus e the y 'r e not supposed to
 hidi ng Je wis h fa mil y.  So
 there was danger both 
sides , you se e.  M y fri ends, t he be
st fri ends, she sur vive bec ause  the 
fa mily, t he vi llages, hidi ng her .  
Yo u know when you bake bread 
you got shovel, you know, in th
e old- fas hioned, a fter  the y

ba ke d the br ead, she went to the ove n to hidi ng.  
And hours a nd hours i n this  very hot ove n she lai d  
down, and she hear when 
the German ask in
 the villages. 
 She survive. 
Q. After the German
s came in, did your 
fa mily do things differently
?  Can you tell me a little bit  
about the occupation? 
A. We  seldom went out fr om th
e house .  Eve r y nois e  ma ke us j u
mp and scare.  They co me fr om 
house in the house and they
 take people.  We
 no have no place
 to hiding. Gentile
 people not hiding 
us because t hey're scar ed, 
too.  Very simple.  Becau
se eas y the y ca n move , a
nd we ca nnot move .  It  
is the hunger, the hunger, the hunge
r.  You no have nothi
ng to eat.  Wh at will you eat a chair or a 
sofa?   You c annot eat t hi s.  In
 a  way , wh en  th ey  
st art the Ghett o, some  people was not  i t  
woul d be di ffe r ent .  The y c onc entr at e us , t hey mu
st give us something to 
eat.  The Ghetto i n Lodz 
was 250 mi llion Je
wish people, but of this ha
lf million people, half was Je
wish.  But they took the 
Je wish pe opl e, what bee n  
in all  of Lodz, concentr ate in Ghett o
 in one  maybe 20 of t he 25 street s is  
all.  In one room, 11 
people were in a room. 
Q.  Did your fa mi ly share 
spac e wit h a not her fa mil y?  
A.  Yes .  

Q.  Wh at happened to your fath
er 's bus i ness  i n all  of thi s?  
A. German took away -- I 
forgot t o tell you -- when 
they come to Lodz, they ha ve already a list who 
bought mac h ines fr om Ger m
any.  So the first things
 what theydone, t hey to
ok my fat her  ma chi nes. 
What  he  e ve n not  fini she d payi ng th
e Ger ma n .  An d t hat
's what happened. 
Q. Then were you 
still in school? 
A. Sc hool?  No more sc hoo
l.  In Ghetto starts school ina room
, i n a street the teacher  take a fe w 
childr en a nd start t eac hing.  Eve ryt hing wa s unbeli eva ble.

Q. But befor e the Ghetto, basicall y all  of the t hings that you nor mall y did cha nge d?   You couldn't  
do them anymore? 

A. No.  Absolutely not. 
 I never saw my friends, 
Gentile friends, because 
they been scared, too. 
Q. So your  s ocial  li fe  ended?  

A.  Oh , co mp lete.  

Q. And the only 
other question I want 
to ask before we talk about 
the Ghetto a littl
e more is, you 
said your  par ents  were  ve ry i nvo
lved with the Zionist Movement? 

A.  Right. 

Q. How di d t hat ha ppe n?   How 
did they get involv
ed wit h t hat?  How act ive wer e t hey?  
A. Because t he anti- Semi tis
m exi ste d in Pola nd.  Polish pe opl e ar
e different fr om American people. 
I mea n if you tell some thing Pol and, he beli ev
e you ri ght a wa y. Somet hin
g bad a b out what the 
Jewish people don't, you know, or
 you hear the story s o mebody sa
y be fore t he war  eve n.  Je wis h  
people kill a Gentile girl and with
 her blood, they make 
matzo.  You understa
nd what I mean? Thi s  
is enough to be a prob
lem.  There was enough because  there 
are  one- wa y tr uck.  Thi s i s Polish 
people .  Eve n t oda y. 

Q.  Do  you have any other me
mories of when the Ger mans 
ca me , how the y tre ate d you? 
A. The y trea t us very, ver y bad.  Eve n when they
 c atch you, you know, some Jewi sh pe ople are ver y  
religious and follow exactly
 the Bible, and s o me pe ople grow be ar
d.  I not mean a bear d now, bear d,  
and have a special  bl ack coat .  Wh
e n Ger ma n sa w some thi ng l i ke t h
at , they cat ch hi m right  away.  
They don't do nothing to him.   
And t hey took ma ny, ma
ny pe ople  to se e a s how from the  stre et.  
And they took scissor and st
art cutting his beard, and the 
beard was very important for 
this speci fic sect of people, beca
use t hey are very nice people.  Th
ey do nothing to
 nobody.  And i t  
hurts so much when yo
u see, even if it was a li
ttle girl what I was.  I do
 anything to finish the

picture, and then they're laughing. 
 After this they kill him in the ey
efor young people.  A little bit of 
anot her a st r eet we hea r  this boom, boo m.  It wa
s -- this i s for pleasure. Q. Did t hey try to do 
anyt hing abusive to you because you wer e 
a gir l, because you we
r e a teenage girl? 
A.  Yo u me a n b eca use  I wa s --  n o
.  Sexual, you 
mean? No.  No. 
Q. Because what 
I ' m tr yi ng t o unders t and, duri n
g all of these time
s was it different  being a girl  than 
a boy, I wonder? 
A. If it come to ph
ysical, I don't think so.  Be
cause there  was not enough to
 t ouc h, my God, t o t ouch 

a Jewish girl, or
 even Gentile, ev
en Gentile.  No. 
Q.  Ok ay .  S o  the  Gh etto  wa s for me d.  

A.  Yes .  

Q. Tell me a little bit about your li
fe in the Ghetto, how it was? 
A.  Ghet to .  Ok ay .  I  was  slee pin g 
wit h, i n one  room, we are s e ven or
 eight people .  Off the fl oor , of 
cour se. And my pare nts been slee ping
 in a not her  hous es, there wa s a  fa
mil y ,  my father 's  cousi n.  So  
they try to go to this fa mily mayb
e we be better, and it was not.  
And we be lay down off the fl oor  
and no sheet s, no not hing.  And a ft e
r  this we wer e  wor ki ng in  Ghet
t o. The  Ger ma n bri ng us t o do  
job.  And he  ask who is , who ca
n ma ke uni for m?   Who c a n make 
a nyt hing?   And e ver ybody s ay, I 
can do it.  They no have
 idea how to do it, but t h
ey wanted to have a little
 better piece of bread or  
somet hing li ke t hat .  My job was  sta n ding t he l i ne s,
 in the line.  Why, I be
en took fr om the line 
when I wait ing for bread or for 
something like that. They take me
 from the line.  I never sa w 
nobody from my fa mil y ti ll thi s day. 

Q. Before we get do that, I want 
to hear a little bit more about the 
Ghetto.  How did you fi nd a place

And we come t o t he pl ace, it was
