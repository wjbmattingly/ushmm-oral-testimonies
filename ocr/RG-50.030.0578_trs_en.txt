Question: It™s the 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum in 
Washington, 
D.C. 
It is Friday, 13 Augu
st 2010, 14:30 hours. We
™re interviewing Mr. 
Virgil 
Myers, 
who served in the 80
th
 in fantry division, 
Patton™s 
third army, 317
th
 
regiment. Mr. 
Myers,
 can you briefly describe your ch ildhood? 
Answer: I was Œ I was brought up on a fa
rm, and I lived on a farm until I was 18 
years of age, and then  I began to  work  for 
Qua ker Oa ts 
comp any, and to go to 
junior college at night. And I graduate
d from the junior college, and then I was 
married at 20 years of ag
e. And I still worked for 
Quaker Oats
 comp any. And I 
started to work for Œ I started 
to go to business college, which 
Quaker Oats
 paid 
for. And I graduated two years later, going 
to school at night, from business college. 
And I Œ my wife and I had a daughter a year 
and a half after we were first married. 
And so, the war came along. I was working at a job with 
Quaker
, which was 
providing food for the milita
ry. And they deferred me one
 time for a year, then my 
name came up ag ain, and I s-said well, I™ll 
probably go this time. They said no, you 
have mo re important job here. An d so 
they deferred me the second time. I was 
down town one day and a la
dy came by and she stopped me by pulling my  arm. She 
said, are you in the military? And I said, no ma™am, I work for
 Quaker Oats
 
comp any. Sh e said, well I have two sons and 
you look as healthy as they are. And I 
don™t understand why that they
™re in the military and you
™re not. And that began to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
4
 
 
worry me and to  bear on my  mind. And th
e next time when my  deferment come up, 
they asked me, and I said no, I don™t want 
it. Which tu rned out to be a bad decision 
on my  part, I thought many, many times during the war. 
Q: So, when  Œ when  and wh
ere did you enter the army? 
A: I entered it Saint 
Joseph
 Œ well, actually at 
Leavenworth, Kansas
. I was 
inducted from Saint
 Joe
, 
Missouri
 and went into the army in 
Leavenworth, 
Kansas. 
Was transferr ed from
 Leavenworth 
to Camp 
Hood, Texas. 
And I was one 
of the first groups that their training 
period was reduced from 18 weeks to 12 

weeks. And we had 12 weeks of basic traini
ng, wh ich really amounted to one day of 
looking at a weapon and being told what 
it was, the next day you would tear that 
weapon down, clean it and put it back toge
ther many, many times. The next day you 
would sp end a half a day in a schoolroom, 
showing videos of ho
w that weapon was 
used in comb at. And then the next day 
you would go on a di
fferent weapon. And 
that™s the way it was for the 12 weeks. An
d you learned to ha 
Œ you hadn™t night 
problems that you would use that weapon fo
r a half a day, and then you were on a 
different type of a weapon. At the end of, 
really the first week that we were there 
was just being assigned, getting our billets
, getting our clothes, and everything. So 
when  it come right down to  it, you only 
had 10 weeks of basic training, because the 
last week you were there, they were givi
ng you orders to go home, and then  to 
where you were to go from th
ere. So you Œ at the time I 
went thro ugh, you really 
only had 10 weeks of basic training.

Q: And when were those dates in Œ when
 Œ wh en Œ wh en were those inclusive 
dates? 
A: I we Œ I went in Œ in Œ on Œ on th
e Œ the first week in May, and the Œ 
Q: Of year Œ year? 
A: Of 1944, and I came home for 10 days
 furlough. Then I was sent to Fort
 Mead, 
Mary land
 and we got on a ship , the Œ th-the Œ 
the first part of September of 1944. 
And from there we went to 
Liverpool, England
, wh ich took us 10 days to go 
across the ocean in a c Œ big co
nvoy. And then we landed in 
Liverpool,
 we got off 
of one boat, walked down th
e dock, got on another boat
, or ship, and went across 
the channel. And I got off at 
Omaha 
Beach on the 27
th
 of September. Went up on 
the hill at 
Omaha
 Beach, which at that time was 
a replacement center. They  had 
two men tents there. And each t Œ and it 
rained every hour that we were on 
Oma ha
 
Beach, and they would tell Œ th
ey told us when we were 
assigned to our tent, there 
is a bulletin board  right down here. You 
look at that bulletin board at least once 
every four hours because yo
ur name will appear and yo
u will be deployed from here 
to some unit. We had no idea wh ere we were going to  be deployed . On th e second 
afternoon, they Œ we went to the bulletin
 board, and my  name and elethe Œ and 
eleven other names were on th
e bulletin board, and we were
 told to load on a truck 
at 12 o™clock and at 12 o™cloc
k we Œ 12 of us loaded  on
, and th ere was a sergeant on 
the truck. He says, I will be in charge 
of you until you reach the deployment area 
where you™ll be assigned. Six 
hours later we ended up at 
Pont A Mo usson, France 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578

on th e 
Moselle
 river. And the 80
th
 Œ and wh en  we got ther
e, we actually unloaded 
on th e west side of the river. And 
a first sergeant by the name of 
Percy Smith
 came 
up, and he was just a small fellow, about fi
ve foot six, smoking a big stogie. And he 
said, I want you fellows to know that 
you have just been assigned to Comp an y
 G, 
of 
317, the fightingest damned outfit in the 
United States 
Army. Well, maybe they all 
told us that, I don™t know. 
But that was our approach  wh en we first reached there. 
Lined up, he got our names, our serial numbe
r, and he said, is there anyone here that 
has ever fired a 60 millimeter mortar? And 
Ken Mau er
(ph), who happened to  have 
taken basic training in 
Fort Hood
 with me, was in the sa
me group that I was in, 
which is a miracle for two pe
ople to be, but we were replacements. At that time we 
found out that the 80
th
 had taken a lot of casualtie
s, and that they needed 
replacements. So
 Percy 
said, you see that bunch of tr
ees about three blocks down 
there? We said yes. He said, th
ere™s a sergeant by the name of 
Fadina s
(ph). You 
report to him, and he™s really
 gonna be glad  to see you, 
because he lost five of his 
squad yesterday in an artillery barrage. So
, that was our re Œ first experience to 
being near comb at situation. And so
 we were assigned to the Company
 G, 
near 
Dieulouard, France
 on th e 29
th
 or 30
th
 of September of 1944. 
Q: I™m sorry sir, I should have asked stra
ight away, wh at is your date of birth? 

A: July 6
th
, 1918. 
Q: Thank you sir. I™m
 sorry, carry on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578

A: No Œ so, we went down and met 
Fadinas
(ph), reported to hi
m. Turned out he 
was a Russian that had come over as a te
enager, to get away from the Germans. 
And he had gotten his citizenship 
by volunteering to come into the 
United Sta tes
 
Army  wh en he was 18 years old. And at 
that time he was about
 20. And so, he was 
a very dedicated American soldier, but 
he hated the Germans with a passion, 
because his parents and his grandparen
ts both had been 
eliminated by the 
SS
 in  
Russia. 
Q: What was your first experience, your  first personal direct experience with 
combat? 
A: My first personal experience was the next
 day. We were to take a labor camp  on 
the east sid e of the 
Moselle 
river. We had th en , after we landed, we went across the 
river near
 Saint Genevieve. 
And Comp any 
G 
was near 
Saint Genevieve, France
, 
and we were to take ov Œ a Polish labor 
camp that was suppos
ed to be in some 
woods, that were just beyond where we 
were. Well, as we started out, we started 
through these woods, and the Germans la
id in an artillery barrage. And I can 
reme mb er t h at 
Ken
 and I were so naïve, that we 
were standing th ere and saying, oh 
look, that artillery sh
ell hit that tree and knocked th
e whole top out of it. Because 
we™d never seen anything like th at. And 
we were Œ were talking about how the 
shells were knocking the limbs off of these 
trees, never thinking about that we could 

get hit ourself. Well, after they k Œ shot 
about 12 shells, it seemed that the Germans 
would traverse to another area, and our 
lieutenant said, c™mon fellows, let™s go. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578

Well, we got up and we started and we 
walk ed about 50 yards. And here was the 
fellow laying on the ground w
ith the medics, and he had 
the top of his helmet and 
his head completely cut o ff with a piece of shrapnel. 
And I looked, and it was one 
of the fellows that rode up on th e truck w
ith me. Here™s a guy that just got into 
combat, didn™t even have hi
s rifle off his shoulder, and 
was killed before we even 
got started. Well, the next time that sh
ells started exploding 
in  trees around us, 
Ken
 
and I were the first ones to 
stick our heads into the root
s of the trees, because we 
didn™t want that to happen to us. And it 
was a very vivid experience of finding out 
what happens in combat, in 
a hurry. But we took that la
bor camp that day, and freed 
about 40 Po lish labor Œ laborers out of a 
camp that were providing labor for an 
electrical company in the area of 
Pont A Mousson. 
Q: Do you recall the name of the camp ? 

A: No, I don™t. I di Œ at that time I was so
 dumb, and so naïve, that we didn™t know 
anything. You know, thinking back  to thos
e days, compared to 
the army  today, we 
were so dumb , and so naïve compared to
 what the soldiers are today, because 
they™v e been  trained, they™re professiona
ls, they know what 
they™re doing, they 
know what their assignments are. And we 
didn™t even have an assignment before 
we came up that day before. And we were
 mo rtar men, and had had two days 
experience on a mortar before we ca
me up to that i Œ to that day. 
Q: Do you ver Œ do you re
member the condition of the 
Polish prisoners, were th ey 
well cared for, were they Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
9
 
 
A: No, they were Œ they were, as I reme
mber, wearing very ra
gged clothes, dirty 
clothes. And that they were very skinny,
 and I would say that they were not well 
taken care of at all. 
Q: Did you communicate with any of them? 

A: No, no, we didn™t. I didn™t.  

Q: And, you said you were a mortar man? 
A: I was a 60 millimeter mort
ar man. Two days later Œ 
Q: Hang Œ I™m sorry Œ 
A: Oh, okay. 
Q: Œ I™m sorry to interrupt you, I beg your
 pardon. Did Œ did you 
establish what sort 
of wo rk were the prisoners engaged in? 
A: What kind Œ you Œ they 
were now Œ it was our unders
tanding that they were 
working an electrical plant in the area of 
Pont A Mousson
, yeah. 
Q: Was it Œ was it a hydro-electric, or was it coal driven , or Œ 

A: Oh, no you™re dri Œ it Œ 
it was one Œ there was no dams
 or anything around there, 
so it had to be some kind of a Œ a Œ like o
il driven, or motor Œ some kind of mo to rs. 
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: I™m sorry. Carry on, please. 
A: Yeah. So, that Œ that day was our experi
ence of Œ of going into  Œ to that. And so 
then we came back to the area of 
Saint Genevieve,
 and we then were assigned, our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
10
 
 
next objective was to take a village and a road junction at 
Sivry
, which was about 
10 miles east of the area that we were 
at that time. Now, you understand that 
comp anies of infantrymen, one co mp any wi
ll take an area and go forward. There 
will be two companies that 
usually will go forward, an
d one company in reserve. 
That next day we were in
 reserve. These other two comp an ies had gone forward 
from
 Dieulouard 
east into 
France. 
And th en we were brough
t up from reserve, and 
said your objective is to take this little village of 
Sivry, s-i-v-r-y, France. 
There is a 
road junction there that the Ge-Germans
 are using that comes down from the 
mountains of s Œ of 
Saint Œ  Sa int J ane
, and 
Saint Mihiel
, and coming down  and 
furnishing supplies to 
the Germans up around 
Metz
. So we want to cut that road 
off. We went into the little village of
 Sivry
, set up our road blocks, never had a fire 
Œ shot fired at us. We went into this 
little village, dug our foxholes, set up our 
defenses in our Œ our area. At midnight th
at night, the Germans started firing from 
the mountains. Now, these are not peaks, 
these are big hills. They had set up their 
artillery and mortars on top of these two big h
ills that overlooked this valley, and at 
midnight they started firing on Comp any
 G 
because we were the only ones in this 
village at that time. And there™s about 75 h
ouses and a big church in this village. By 
daybreak there was not one building in that
 little village that was still standing. We 
went in that village that da
y, short of our component of 
[indecipherable]
 we had 
169 men. And th ey shelled us every time a
nybody would move outs
ide of a foxhole. 
They  let us dig in, th e oth Œ that afternoo
n before, and never fired on us. But that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
11
 
 
night they started firing on that field, a
nd the village. And by th
e next morning, all 
those houses were completely flat. And they
 kept firing all mo rning. The afternoon 
fog moved in, and it began to get dark abou
t 4:30 in th e afternoon and we got notice 
to pull out. Out of the 159, 
the daily report of Comp any 
G 
shows that 40 men 
walked out, and back 
up over the hill that night. Now,
 I don™t know that all of them 
got killed. We know that abou
t 38 of them got captured in
 that village, but the rest 
of them were injured, and th
at was Œ that was my first 
day of real comb at, and you 
can become an experienced person of
 combat in a very short time.  

Q: Were you involved in the 
Battle of the Bulge
 as well? 
A: Yes. On Œ we were near 
Sain t Avold, France
, near a little Œ in a little villag e 
called 
Gunwaller
(ph), and we had just 
finished the battle of 
Farebersviller
 on 
November the 27
th
, through the 29
th
. And we had co me up to 
Sa int Avo ld,
 and were 
in reserve. And we were there and we notic
e of a m Œ and about 
nine o™clock in the 
morning, there will be trucks here at 12 o™
clock to load us up,
 because we™re gonna 
take a trip up to 
Luxembourg . 
Well, nobody knew wh ere the heck 
Luxembourg
 
was. We didn™t Œ had never heard of it even
. And so we, after Œ on the way up there, 
well, we got talking about it and trying to figure out what we were gonna do. We 

had heard th at the Germans had broke throug
h up there, and that we were supposed 
to go up and support the troops that we
re up there. Well, it™s about 125 miles from
 
Saint Avold
 up to where we were going. And that
 evening, or that night, we ended 
up ju st east of 
Luxembourg
 city at 
Go ndera ng e, 
between 
Gonderange
 and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
12
 
 
Junglinster
. And th e next mo rning we got notice, Comp any 
G
 was to be 
transferred, and we got in 
trucks and went up 
over Œ they call them mountains, we 
call them big hills here Œ th
ey went over the big hill to 
Steinsul
(ph), a village of 
Steinsul
(ph). And from
 Steinsul
(ph) we went to the west. He wa Œ he ended up in 
Mersch
 where headquarters comp any, but we were west of
 Mersch
 on th e 
mountain west and going dow
n the ridge north towards 
Ettelbruck
. And we walked 
all evening, and up to  about 10 o™clock at
 night, and we found a big barn, and it was 
sn Œ it was beginning to  sleet. And they put 
us up Œ we all got into that barn, and 
laid down and slept til the next mornin
g. But we could hear gunfire during th e 
night, so we knew th at we were getting clos
e to the Œ the front. 
But it was still about 
five miles north before we 
ran into any activity at all, which was just west of 
Ettelbruck
. And from there we went to 
Niederfeulen
, and we were at 
Niederfeulen
 and th en it began to snow and got co
ld as hell. Cold as hell. And the 
next day would have been the 23
rd
 Œ well, we were in 
Niederfeulen 
a couple a Œ a 
couple of days, and then we 
were supposed to go north of
 Niederfeulen
 to 
Bourscheid 
and 
Walscheid
 and 
Kehmen
. And as we went up the ridge, and got 
just south of 
Kehmen
, they opened fire on us, and we
 didn™t realize it, but they had 
a mountain to the east and north  of that area,
 that they could see the whole area, it Œ 
it was like open country to th
em, and they  could see us. And that was where what 
was called Bloody Ridge, today, yet today to the 
Luxembourg
 people, because we 
were tied down there for two days, and took
 severe Œ 317 took severe casualties all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
13
 
 
that two days, because every time anybody go
t out of a foxhole, they would get shot 
at, because they could see 
them from across the valley 
from that mountain in  the 
woods where they had their artillery and mo
rtars dug in . And that™s what most of it 
was, was shrapnel from artillery, and it 
would hit the frozen ground, and it wo uld 
just skip, and hit people, if you were e
xposed . And from there Œ we were there two 
days. They drew us back, 
and th en  we went into 
Hiderscheid
(ph), and into Œ we 
went into  
Hiderscheid
(ph), and replaced 
Œ 319 had been in, 
that was another 
regiment of the 80
th
, and they Œ they  pulled out and moved farther west, towards
 
Bastogne
, and we then replaced them at 
Hiderscheid
(ph). And we got 
counterattacked that first ni
ght, and then we were able 
to save that. And then our 
objective was to go across the Œ it™s the cli
ff river in that area that goes on down. 
But from there, we were on the front  side of that mountain, near 
Tadler
 and 
Ringel
 
and all that area, for almost two weeks, ri
ght in that area, because they were across 
the valley firing back  at us, and hell, we 
couldn™t move. We Œ every time we Œ we 
would move Œ plus the fact that supplies, 
we didn™t have supplies, and th en on the 

21
st
 of January, we had Œ our objective was to start from 
Ringel
 to go down the 
valley and up over the mountain to
 Bourscheid, 
and to help to take 
Bourscheid.
 I 
was in what was called the weapons plato
on, the fourth  platoon, and I had 26 men 
that mo rning. And Captain 
Namkowitz
(ph), who was the comp any commander 
said, 
Myers, 
take your men and Œ a
nd Œ and along with 
Heizer
(ph) and his ma chine 
gun, you fellows walk up th e Œ the fire al ley in the forest, because, he said, you can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
14
 
 
carry your weapons, we don™t need you til yo
u get to the top. Well, we didn™t know 
it, but they had an  88 dug in  up at the top,
 and there was 15 to 18 inches of snow on 
the ground, and it was 18 below zero that mo
rning, and Œ or that afternoon. As we 
walked up the hill Œ now
, out of my squad that Œ that 
day, of 12 men, I had nine 
men that had just come up, because they 
were new replacements
, just Œ and I Œ I 
was an old man then, because I™d had fro
m October, November, December, so I had 
90 days of experience of Œ of
 that. I was 26 years old, and everybody wanted to get 
into my squad because I was 
the oldest man there. And 
they thought that because I 
was older that I was Œ I was Œ ma ybe could keep them safe. Well, tha-that didn™t ha 

Œ that wasn™t the way it was in combat. 
You just were lucky 
wherever you were. 
But anyway, I had young men, inexperienced,
 and as the 88 started firing down th e 
firepath at us, they started running. We 
kept hollering, drop in  the snow, drop in  the 
snow. Well, they didn't do it. They ran to 
get into the trees. And the Germans had 
wire traps all up the 
hill, with bouncing 
Betty
 booby traps that were half gallon 
bucket size, s-syrup bucket size, that would 
jump 40 inches in the air and explode, 
and they were filled with shrapnel. And 
they were devastating. Well, when we 
started to run, 
Heizer
(ph) and I hit the ground in th
e center of the firepath, in the 
snow. They were running, they
 hit these, and out of the 
26 men, 22 of them got Œ 
were casualties. And that afternoon, that 
Œ after that afternoon, four o™clock they 
called off the Œ the advance. About the fi Œ 
si Œ third or fourth  shell that that 88 
fired, tanks started firing at that 88 an
d finally knocked it out. But that was Œ we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
15
 
 
only had about four or five 
shells from that 88, and that was all becau se they 
knocked it out. But that evening, 
there were so many casualties in 
G 
Comp any, that 
that evening, 
not only in 
G
 Company, but in th
e second battalion going up that hill, 
that when they called it o
ff, they™ve all had Œ called for volunteers of 22 men from 
the company, and two officers to carry
 the casualties to
 Œ back towards 
Ringel
, so 
they could be put in trucks and into ambul
ances to be taken back to the first aid. 
And that day, after that day, gi Œ 
G
 Comp any had less than 50 men in Œ in it that 
day, and we were attached 
then  fo r three mo re days to another comp any, because 
we were declared inoperative. So, until 
we could get more replacements up, why, 
we were attached to another company a
nd th at Œ that was one
 day that you don™t 
forget.  
Q: After Œ i-it seems to me that in an ex
traordinarily comp ressed period of time, you 

experienced a tremendous amount of comb at
, and saw a lot of losses and a lot of 
men killed. At that point, did th at experien
ce change the way th
at you felt about the 
war, and your role in it? 

A: Well, I went to Captain
 Na mko wit z
(ph), and I said, Captain, I had Œ by that time 
I had a squad of six men, my self, a
nd then  the other sergeant, Sergeant 
Magarlick
(ph) had six men. We had lostso many men I went to Captain
 
Namkowitz
(ph) and I said, I think that I™m bad lu
ck, and that I hadn™t b Œ outta be a 
squad leader. He said, 
Myers,
 he said, it™s not your fau
lt. He said, work with me. 
He said, you™ve got mo re experien ce than 
anybody else around here now. He said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
16
 
 
don™t do this to me. And so that™s Œ that™s
 the only reason I stayed, was because he Œ 
he asked me to, and he talked
 me out of it, because I really felt that I was bad luck. 
Q: Did you, as you were advancing, 
come across any concentration camp s? 
A: No, not in that area. 
Q: When  Œ after you moved into  the 
Rhin eland
 and wh at have you, wh-w hat was 
your first experience o-
of coming across a camp? 
A: The first experience, of course, was Œ 
was, for me was not until we got clear to 
boo Œ to 
Weim a r.  

Q: And when was that? Da-Datewise? 
A: And that was April the 12
th
, the mo rning of April Œ when Œ wh en  Comp any 
G, 
and the 80
th
 division came up to
 Weimar
, and th e 319
th
 came to 
Weimar 
and they 
sent a message to the mayor of 
Weimar
, surrender the city, or we will attack it with 
tanks and artillery. 

Q: Yeah, 319 was armor, was it not? 
A: No, 319 was another Œ was 
another regime nt of the 80
th
 division. 
Q: Okay, so it was infantry. 
A: It was infantry. An d they came up and all of us, each regiment had an armo red 
unit attached to it, like the 307. Three 
Œ 307 tank battalion was attached to th e 
second battalion of 317. Bu t th
ree wee Œ actually, 317 as we came Œ we had been in 
Erfurt
 for three days fighting. And 
then we started and came to 
Weimar
, and it™s 
only 10 miles to
 Weimar
 from
 Erfurt. 
And when  we got to 
Erfurt,
 why 319 was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
17
 
 
ahead of us, and 317 was in 
reserv e. They call it reserve, we were held Œ we were 
all like a mile back of them, so
 that if they got in troubl
e, why we could be deployed 
up to  help th em. But we stopped and we sat 
there for Œ fo r quite a Œ for about three 
or four hours. And finally, why they gave 
the message to the mayor to surrender the 
city, and he and a lady on a bicycle 
came out with a white flag, and they 
surrendered the city. So, 319 went around th
e city, 317, with the second battalion, 
came into
 Weimar
 and we were the only ones that was in 
Weimar
 from the 80
th
 
division actually, because 319 skirted it 
and went around, and 318 followed them. 
317 was left in reserve so that we could 
Œ our Œ ou-our assignment was to do police 
work and keep control of the city. And th
at™s what we did. 317, th e three Œ the 
second battalion walked  right down  th
e main street from the west, into
 Weimar.
 As 
we walked down the street, we were on both
 sides of the street, about five, 10 yards 
apart, each one of us, as we got downtown, 
the civilians that were on the street as 
we walked  by, would tu rn th
eir back to us and face the walls of the stores, and 
wouldn™t look at us. Wouldn™t look at us at
 all. But the kids, the kids would run out 
and say, have you got any 
gumy
(ph), 
gumy
(ph), 
gumy
(ph)
 chocolate. 
And so they 
were just like kids back home
. And wh en we got down town, to
 Weimar
, we went 
down to the plaza that is right in the cent
er of town by the c
ity hall, and company 
G, 
Captain
 Namko witz
(ph) set his headquarters up in 
a building right down  on the Œ 
on th e square. So he signed all the different 
ones. I had to s-set up on a street with 

my mortars, near the railroad station, so th
at I could see down  the railroad tracks, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
18
 
 
case that a train come, or so
mething like that. So, we were there. We kept seeing 
these people who were in striped suits. 
Not many, but we would see them once in 
awhile, walk by. Finally Captain
 Namkowitz
(ph) told
 Percy Sm ith, 
who was the 
first sergeant of 
G 
Comp any, he said, 
Percy
, he says, you take down 
Smith
 th e 
Jeep
 driver in a 
Jeep
 and get 
My ers
, and you guys go see if you can find out wh ere 
the hell these guys are coming from. He said, wa Œ wh ere are they coming from? He 
said, we™d see Œ they mu st be a Œ a prison,
 or a jail around here that they™re getting 
out of. So, we started, a
nd we asked four different 
civilians, where are these 
prisoners?
 Nix
(ph), 
nixt
(ph), we don™t know, we don™t know. They didn™t know 
where they were coming from. Well, we went
 down  to the railroad st Œ track, or 
down  by the station and sa
w two boys that were about 10 - 12 years old. 
Percy
 
could speak a little bi
t of German, and 
Percy
 got out of th e 
Jeep
 and he went over 
to these boys, he said, where are these 
prisoners coming from? And they said, oh, 
way out on the hill, way up on
 a hill, way out in the count
ry. So, we started to drive 
out in th at direction. We drove fo r about 
four miles, and we 
thi Œ and we got to 
talking, we said, you know, those damn  kids
, they Œ th ey™ve given us bad direction, 
there can™t be anything out here, and we
 still didn™t see it. But we were on a 
country, a dirt road that ha
d been traveled a lot. So, 
Don 
said, well, we™ll just follow 
this up around the hill. So we went up arou
nd the hill, and then 
right at the top of 
this hill, here was a 10 foot wire fence. 
Guys were just leaning against it, just 
looking. We drove up to the gate, and we 
didn™t know what it wa
s. We saw all these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
19
 
 
buildings. Now, at the wi Œ at that time, we
 didn™t realize that we were at the back 
gate of 
Buch enwald
, which was down by where the 
museum is now. But there was 
a fence all around that area on the west si
de of the camp, and we came up on the 
west side of the camp. And 
Percy 
got out and he asked th e guy,
 he said, what is this 
place, anyway? And the guy says, 
ein minute, ein minute. 
He goes into a barracks 
and comes out with a little fello
w that was five foot six.
 Skinny? God, he didn™t 
weigh 70 pounds, he didn™t weigh 60 pounds. 
He said, my name is so and so, and I 
am from
 Lithuania
. He said, I™ve been in
 th is camp  for four years. He could speak 
English, very good English. He
 said, I been in this camp 
for four years, and he said, 
this is
 Buchenwald
 work camp. 
Percy
 said , w o rk  camp , w h at
 the hell is a work 
camp? He said, well, we furnish Œ he said, 
they come here and this is a big camp. 
He said, there™s other little camps all around, 
at the industries and out in the farms, 

that furnish labor from here. And he said Œ 
Percy
 said, well, who™s in charge here? 
He said, well, the 
SSers 
were until last night, and they 
heard that you were headed 
this way, and, he said, they ran. He sa
id, there was about 3,000 of them here. We 
said, 3,000? And he said yes, he said, 
there was approximately 3,000 here before 
you came here. He said, how many people 
are in this camp, 
anyway? Well, we 
could see Œ now, where we came in, there 
were low one, just one story buildings 
that looked like 
they had been  put up in  a hurry. 
They had just Œ I don™t know 
whether it was straw board, or what, but
 it wasn™t Œ it Œ it was Œ looked like 
temporary build ings. And so he 
said, this camp here, is Œ is
 the west part Œ he said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
20
 
 
the main gate is over there. Well, we di
dn™t know that there was a name Œ main  
gate. And later on, we found out that 
other people from 317 had co me in on th e 
front side of the gate. But he said, th
ere was some guys here yesterday in a 
mo torized vehicle, kind of like a tank, but 
he said, they didn™t 
even come in. They 
just were here for a short time, an d he sa
id, they left. And we said, well, what did 
you have to Œ wh at ar
e you eating? And he said, well, he said, the
 SSers
 had some 
potato peelings that they  had peeled  yest
erday and threw in the dump , and he said, 
we got them and washed them
, and th en, he said, we went over there and got green 
grass and brought over and put 
in with that, and he said, 
that™s all w e™ve had to eat 
today. So , we went inside the camp , just to
 the first row of buildings, and in front of 
the barracks, they had 
people laying out, and 
Percy
 says, what happened to th em? 
Oh, they just died. They just
 died. And about that time, 
here come six  guys pulling a 
two wh eel cart up from around the corner, 
down  below. And they  were picking 
these dead guys up and putting them on this
 two wheel cart. And I don™t know what 
they were doing with th em wh
en  they got them, you know. But 
Percy
 said, well, I 
don™t rememb er was 
Percy
, me or 
Don 
said, what do they do
 with them? Well, he 
says, they have a cremator Œ had Œ they ha
ve an oven up there.
 An oven? Yeah , he 
said, they burn them
. He said, they burn
 th e bodies. Well, come find out they had 
two crematories there with four ovens in
 each building, and they  wo rked  them 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. And Œ so 
Percy
 said, how many people are here? 
He said, well, we think there 
is about 26,000 
here now. And 
Percy
 said, who™s in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
21
 
 
charge? Well, we have a committ
ee that™s in charge, but, he
 said, really nobody™s in 
charge. He said, a bunch of
 them took off after the
 SSers. 
He said, they broke into 
the armament, and they are after the 
SSers
 now. And he said, we™ve got ninet Œ now 
I™m Œ I Œ I might be wrong, but he said Œ I 
think that he said, we have 19 of them 
locked up on th
e other side in a building. And so
 Percy
 and I and 
Do n
 went back to 
town  and Captain
 Namko witz
(p h), we told him what we
™d found. He said, well, 
I™m going to call division and tell them what™s
 there. So they said, well, we™ll h ave 

some trucks with some food and blankets and medicine up th ere tomo rrow. So, I 

was assigned with my five man Œ 
six man, I was assigned from the 13
th
, the 14
th
 and 
up until about noon on the 15
th
 to go around and pick  up th ese guys that were in Œ s-
straggling in town, and to take them back 
out to camp for Œ so 
that they could get 
medicine. And some of the fellows didn™t wa
nt to go back out to
 camp. But we told 
them that they were gonna be
 food out there, the best we
 could. Tried to tell them, 
but we had one fellow that wa
s at the edge of town , and he came  out of a house 
eating a potato that mu st have weighed a po
und. And he was just
 eating that thing 
just like it was a candy bar. He
 walked out to Œ almost to
 where our je Œ truck was Œ 
Jeep
, and he fell over. Well, we picked him up, put him in the 
Jeep
 and took him 
back out to the camp, and Dr. 
Bob 
out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out 
there and by that time they 
had set up some medics also that had got there. And he 
said, this poor guy, he didn™t weigh 60 po
unds. He said, this poor guy was e Œ we 
told him wh at happened, and he said, well, 
probably the starch in the potato was just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
22
 
 
too mu ch  for his system and he just can™t ha
ndle it, he just couldn't handle it. So, on 
the 15
th
, then, I was r Œ they Œ I was relieved 
by Œ now, I Œ I think it was people Œ 
fellows from a cavalry  that replaced us, bu
t by that time then, 
our headquarter, our 
comp any headquarters had moved, and we went to 
Gina
(ph). 
Gina
(ph) was east of 
there, and so we went to
 Gina
(ph) from Œ from there. 
Q: When  you said you su 
Œ you supplied them with bl
ankets and medicine and Œ 
and fo od and wh at have you, wh at sort of food did you provide? Were they 
K
 
rations, was it 
[indecipherable]
 what was it? 
A: It da Œ da Œ I ha Œ I™d Œ I honestly d
on™t know, because I didn™t go into th e camp  
to see, but I would assume, I would assume that it was probably 
K 
ra Œ 
K 
rations or 
something like that, the f Œ on th at first truck. 

Q: Sure. And how long Œ how 
long of a di Œ did you spend actually  inside the camp  
itself? 
A: I would say th Œ probably  th Œ 30 
minutes maybe. Maybe 30 minutes that we 
took and saw wh at was happening and ev
erything. The guys never Œ they just 
looked by us when
 we were in there. Now, some of them, four or five trailed alo ng 
with us, as we were walking in there. But 
other than that, they were so sick. And I 
didn™t realize it until this 
year, when we were in 
Weimar
 and was talking to fellows 
that were in the camp, that the backside of 
Buchenwald
 was called the death camp . 
That wh en  they had people that were so sick and so 
em an cip a ted
 that they thought 
they were gonna die, they would bring them 
back to that part of the camp and Œ and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
23
 
 
put them there. They asked me in the evenin g if I would tell about finding th e camp  
and what I had seen and such as this. One 
fellow, afterwards he said, he was in the 
cr Œ in the group, and he held his hand up
, and I said, yes, sir? He said, what you 
have just said, I can verify 
every word , because, he said, I was a 16 year old Jewish 
boy that had typhus fever, that they had pu
t me into the death camp. I said, what do 
you mean death camp? He said, that™s what 
that part of the camp was called. If they 
expected you to  die in the next four or fi
ve days. And he said, I was destined to be 
eliminated in four or five days, but yo
u guys came along, and saved my  life. And I 
said no, the 
SSers
 were gone. We didn™t save you, 
we Œ we just happened  to come 
up th ere. He said no, they knew that you 
were coming and they left. So, he said, I 
want to come up and shake your hand. And he did, and he started crying, and so did 
I. And so , he said, my na
me is Œ  my  n ame is  
Klein.
 He said, I have been an 
American citizen for over 45 years a
nd I™m a r Œ a Œ a Jewish rabbi in 
California
. I 
have his picture with his wife and his son, that had been  invited to come back to 

Weimar
 as one of the former prisoners. And 
he said, I just want to thank you, 
because you saved my life. And I said, no, we
 didn™t. But, I said Œ he said, well, as 
far as I™m concerned, you 
did, because the next da
y I was in a hospital in 
Gina
(ph), 
and two days after that, I was in 
England
, and he said, then I was sent to the 
United 
States 
to completely recover, and 
that™s where I™ve stayed. 
Q: As you pressed on, did you come acr
oss any of the subc
amps, or any other 
concen tration camps as you 
[indecipherable]
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
24
 
 
A: Now, they told us that there were sub
camps all around, that they furnished labor 
out of there. Now, part of
 our 319 came by a camp called
 Orndo rf
(ph), which was 
to the west of there. And this year we went back to 
Orndorf
(ph) and course all it is 
there is the same way at Œ at 
Buchenwald
, is just where the buildings were, and a 
monument that they have there 
in a couple places. But at th
at time, it was a hellhole, 
because they didn™t treat 
them as nice as they 
treated them even in 
Buchen wald
, 
which it was horrible. 
Q: Having seen what you 
saw in the camps, in 
Buchenwa ld
, did it alter your view 
of th Œ of the war, a
nd your role in it? 
A: Well, it made me realize why that we 
were fighting. That Œ that solidified why 
we were over there. 

Q: And did it alter the way th
at you dealt or interacted 
with the German populace?  
A: Not really, not really. Because I didn™t Œ w-we were in the infantry in the line 
companies, and we weren™t in
 head quarters and su ch as
 that. So, w-we only got 
build ings that had been  assi
gned to  us. We weren™t in th
e job of taking build ings, or 
taking Œ making our own assignments. Bu
t I would say that this time, at the 
banquet, the prime minister of 
[indecipherable]
 looked at we five guys that were 
there, and he sa Œ when he started talking,
 he said, I want to 
thank you for freeing 
the German people from the 
tyranny of the Nazi political 
regime, because he said, 
we were prisoners and didn™t realize 
it as well as these p eople here at 
Buchenwald
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
25
 
 
were. And I thought that was quite a st
atement. And Œ but it proves what can 
happen to politicians when 
they get too much power. 
Q: When you first came across 
Buchen wald
, did you have any id
ea what you were 
looking at? Di Œ wa Œ wou 
Œ had you heard st
ories, had you he
ard reports about 
concen tration camps, or was Œ did it co
mpletely take you by surprise?  
A: Well, this took us by surprise, becaus
e we had heard of co
ncentration camps, but 
we didn™t really know what
 they were. We hadn™t seen
 any Œ I hadn™t seen any 
pictures of any, and I didn™t know 
that they were as big as what 
Buch enwald
 was, 
damn , that covered 400 acres. And the Œ th e 
buildings that were there, there were 
three story build ings, there were two story 
buildings, and then there were a lot of 
these pre Œ kind of prefab buildings around 
the west side, the edge there, where we 
came up. And th at, I couldn™t Œ I™d Œ I was 
amazed, really, because I™d Œ I didn™t 
realize that Œ that the labor camp, what th
e heck they were doi
ng with that many 
people for a labor camp, you know? 

Q: Sure. Did you stay on after the 
war, with the Œ with the unit in 
Germany
? 
A: In 
Germ any
, I stayed. I Œ I Œ I didn™t come home until the 16
th
 of January of 
1946. After the war, or at the end of the Œ after the war was over, 
Percy Smith
 got 
to come home because he 
had enough points, and I t
ook over as first sergeant of
 G
 
Comp any, and I was acting gi 
Œ first sergeant for almost 
five months. And so, from 
Œ we were at 
Shpital
(ph) on th e Russian line, and we
 were Œ we furnished guard 
duty fo Œ at 
[indecipherable]
 
Goering 
and
 Hitler
 and all had the 
paintings and all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
26
 
 
of the beautiful things, artwork that was 
done, but I never got to go inside until 25 
years after that, the wife and I went 
back and I got to go in side of the 
Neuschwateine
(ph) castle there. And that wa
s first time . I was on guard duty 
outside fo r almo st a month, but I didn™t get inside. Bu t I did then , but Œ 

Q: Do you remember rece
iving your orders home? 
A: Well, yes, because I gave them to my
self. At the Œ we were Œ we were in 
Bavaria
 up until November, then we went to 
Czechoslovakia
 when  they had an 
election of Œ in 
Czechoslovakia
. Then we came back to 
Scho ng au
, and at 
Scho ng au
 we were there probably Œ I said 
November, it was October when we 
went to Œ to czechos
l Œ or to Œ yeah, 
Czechoslovakia
. And then we came back 
Scho ng au
 for a month, then we went to 
Aufschaffensburg
(ph)
,
 
Germany
, which 
at that time was a deployment point. And 
our job was that they wo uld send in 
G.I.s
 
from all over 
Europe
 into 
Aufschaffensburg
(ph)
 
and each mo rning I would get 
orders Œ well, when they  would come in, I 
would get their orders, that they wo uld Œ 
the name, and how many points they had,
 and their number. And th en I would get 
each morning, an order, toda
y you have to ship out so
 many people to f Œ to go 
home, but they have to have so many point
s. So I would go th r
ough the rosters, and 
pick out the Œ the rest of the guys were
 doing nothing, actually, ther Œ that were 
there. But we knew that we were gonna ge
t to come home pretty 
soon, so then I got 
orders that the 80
th
 division was to move
 home on about the 29
th
 of December, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
27
 
 
think it was. So, we were re
placed by another outfit that 
took over our job, and we 
then went to 
La Havre
 and got on a boat 
and came home. 
Q: What was that like, 
what was coming home like? 
A: Well, we got into  one hell of a storm by the 
Azores
. And the captain of the boat 
said, I™ve been a captain
 of Œ in the navy for 31 years,
 and have never seen waves in 
the English channel like this. The boat wo
uld go up and come 
down and hunks of 
enamel or paint would pop off of the side 
of the boat, like that. Guys in their bunks 
Œ they had bunks five high
, you know, wrapped with rope and the ropes would 
actually break and the guys would fall, 
and everybody was seasick, my  God, 
everybody was seasick . And he said, I™ve neve
r seen waves like this
 in my 31 years. 
And I thought, my God, I was in combat 
210 days and I™m going to go drown going 
home. That™s what I thought, I really did, 
but boy. Bu t after five days it Œ it began to 
smooth out. We came into 
New York
 and set outside of 
New York 
harbor for four 
hours in the dark and we couldn™t figure 
out why. Well, they 
waited until daybreak 
to take us by the Statue of lemer Œ of
 Liberty. And man, everybody Œ everybody 
was crying and f Œ happy and 
hollering and ev erything. And hello statue, and they 
all laughed, and it was Œ it was a very happy
 time. It was just wonderful. And then 
they unloaded us at 
New York, 
took us over to Camp
 Kilm er
 and from Camp
 
Kilmer 
they took us into a big assembly hall, th
e first thing. When 
we got off of the 
train, we marched into there. When we
 got in there, on the stage was a big 
American flag, and they  had a Œ a big fan 
in back of that flag, and it was just a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0578 
28
 
 
flopping, and they were playing the nati
onal anthem. And I can still do Œ I can still 
think about that. That Œ that was a very emo
tional, it even is yet today, I™m sorry.  
Q: What was seeing your family like, again? 

A: Well, my wife met me in 
Saint Louis. 
I was deployed  to 
Sa int Louis
, and Œ to 
get discharg ed, and was supposed to meet 
her at a certain hotel. I got there, she 
wasn™t there. They Œ for af
ter, I™d said to the clerk, 
and I went back  about three 
different times, and I said, she has to be 
here, because this is where we were to 

meet. And they said, well, wait just a minut
e. So they  went over and they looked 
through the thing, and they said, oh, we di
dn™t have a room here. We had to put her 
up in to a Œ a hotel in the east Œ the west pa
rt of town. And so  I took a taxi and went 

– and it was Œ it was a joy, because I hadn™t
 seen her for two years. I hadn™t really 
had anything except just a letter, because yo
u don™t Œ you didn™t have computers or 
cell phones, or anything like that today.
 I can™t believe how the guys talk home 
every day, you know? And it 
was Œ it was Œ we were married 70 years and I lost her 
last year. B u t I have lot of wonde
rful, wonderful, w
onderful memories. 
Q: Sir, this interview is for posterity. Wh
at would you most like future generations 
to know about your experiences? What
 would you most like them to learn? 
A: Never to let their damn politicians get en
ough power that they 
think that they are 
the boss, instead of the people. And that 
worries me right now, because there isn ™t 
anyone listening to anyone in 
Washington. 
And this has to change. I talked to a lot 
of high school™s history classes in 
Florida, 
I™m Œ I happen to live in 
Florida

Œ I never talked very much 
about my experiences until ab
out 15 years ago, and my 
granddaughter said, Grandpa, will you come
 to our history c Œ and tell us about 
World War II? I said, what can I tell you? 
She said, well Œ I said, why don™t you 
have your history teacher write me down so
me things that she 
would like for me to 
cover? So she did. And so fro
m that, I talked to her class 
and told  them Œ and then I 
opened it up and Œ fo r questions, and let them ask me questions about it. And from 
that I started. And the year before my wife
 got sick, and I had to
 kind of quit this for 
awhile, I talked to 
46 different schools in one ye
ar, about World War II, and the 
Battle of the Bulge, and this, and I bring 
it up to them, that if your parents aren™t 
voting, then  you keep on th em, and make 
sure that they vote for someone, and to 
study their Œ what they stand for before 
you let them go. And don™t let them say , 
well, I don™t have time. Because they do ha
ve time, and it™s their duty to you to see 
that this country  stays like it has been down through th e centuries, up until this time. 

Because this is the only country in the wo
rld like us, and we don™t want it to be 
changed. And so , I™ve Œ I feel Œ and I™ve 
been  doing this now for almo st 15 years, 
and I™ll probably get back into it again. 

Q: I hope you do. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Any closing words, sir? 
A: No. We thank you, and I think what you
 have done here in this building is 
something that, it Œ it Œ it has 
been needed, and the people 
need Œ mo re people need

to see what happened , so that they won™t le
t it happen here in 
this country , because 
it can happen. It can happen. Yo u know, th e German people, the only reason it 
happened  in  
Germany
 was because 
Hitler
 was such a 
charismic
 speaker that he 
convinced people that he kn
ew more than what they di
d, and that he was Œ his 
group of people were smarter than what th
ey  were. And that he had the answers to 
bring 
Germ any
 back from 40 percent unemp loyment to wh at it was back befo re 
World War I. They fell for it. And the Sena
te rescinded their authority and let him 
have a one man decision on all questions, 
problems and answers to what he thinks 
that ger Œ is best for 
Germany
. The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was 
after he got this authority, was to eliminat
e everyone th at disagreed with him, by 
building up hate within the peop
le for a specific problem that 
Hitler
 wanted to  get 
rid of. That was religion, God, and his en
emies. And he was successful in getting 
the Senate to relinquish their power a
nd to give it to him. But in the new 
constitution of 
Germany
, they  no longer have that 
authority to relinquish  that 
power to one person. It must st ay in a vote in 
Germany
. So I was told in
 Weimar
 
this time, because I ask them.
