The life stor ies  of Holoc aus t s u
r vivor s  tr ans c ends  dec ades .  When
 
you're about to hear  fr om  
Fr ank
, you will hear his  indiv idual ac c ount of the Holoc aus t.  We're going to go through a brief s lide 
pr es entation to help me introduce Fr ank .
 
 
This  is Fr ank  as a c hild who was  born in Gliwic e, Germ any, now Poland, in 1929.  Fr ank was  
the only c hild of Hans  and Lotte Liebermann.

Her e we s ee on the left his  father , Hans  Lieber mann, and on the r ight, his  mother , Lotte 
Lieberm ann, holding Frank 's  gr
anddaughter
,  
whic h he will tell you about later.
 
 
Both of Frank's parents' families  had lived in this  par t of Germ any, now Poland, for s everal 
generations .  Frank  is  pic tur ed her e with his  pater nal gr andparents, Bernar d and J enny Lieberm ann.
 
 
When Adolph Hitler c ame to power  in 1933 and When Fr ank began s c hool in 1935, J ewis h 
s tudents wer e s eparated from n
on
-
J ewis h s tudents  and fear  of anti
-
Se
m i
tic
 
attacks bec am e frequent.  
 
 
Her e is  a pictur e of Frank 's  fir st gr ade c las s on firs t day of s c hool.  You might wonder  what the 
totes they are holding are.  They are totes  c ontaining sweets  to make the fir s t day of s c hool s weet.  And 
Fr ank is on the s ec ond row, four th fr om  the right.
 
 
In 1936
 
--
 
and we'll talk  about this  in a little m or e detail in a bit
 
--
 
Fr ank's  f
ather was  no longer 
able to prac tic e m edic ine as  a r es ult of anti
-
J ewis h laws.  And in 1938 the fam ily tried to obtain visas  to 
c om e to the United States.  Hans  tr aveled first and Frank  and his mother followed a few m onths later in 
Oc tober
 
1938.  And her e is  a pictur e of Frank 's mother's  ticket to the s hip they took  to the United 
States.
 
 
With that I'd like to invite Frank to the s tage
 s
o that we c an begin our c onvers ation together.

Fleming:  Fr ank, it's  a delight and a pr ivilege to k now y ou and to have you be a 
volunteer at this  mus eum .  I know what a gift you'r e going to be to our audienc e today.
 
 
I'd like to s tar t with your  c hildhood.  The pic tur e of you fr om fir s t grade and your c las s , c an you 
tell
 
us  a little about thos e very early memories of your  c hildhood in Germ any? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, I gr ew up in what I would c all a middle c las s hom e.  We lived on the 
m
ain 
s
tre
et, s om ething like Connec tic ut Avenue. We had public transportation.  My father had an office 
when you c am e in, and the apartm ent was  in back of the hous e.  We had bas ic ally a three
-
bedroom  
apar tm ent.  
 
 
I was  pr etty independent.  I had what I would s ay a fairly norm al c hildhood for the fir st
 
--
 
when 
I rec all going way bac k, ab
out as far as  m y m emory s tretc hes, it c hanged pr etty drastic ally in 1936.  A 

tr eaty protecting minor ities  was  abr ogated and the Nazis  fully took  over .  The peac e treaty of the 

Crim eanWar whic h es tablis hed Poland pr otected m inorities on the Polis h s ide of the bor der  and the 
Germ an s ide of the bor der  for 15 year s .  That was  over in 1936.  And at that time you found the 
pr opaganda news paper pos ted on ever y s tr eet cor ner.  There were bloc k ades  of J ewis h s tores.  We 
had no ac c es s  to parks, s wim ming pools , and basic ally found s afety in going alone or in small gr oups  
s o that we wouldn't be notic ed by anybody.  And that m ade me pretty independent.  I rode m y bic yc le 

wher ever I wanted to.  You developed ins tinc ts  for  your  safety.
 
 
That's about it.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-F
leming:  I want to go back  to the c ontext of Gliwic e a little bit to give our audienc e 
a sens e of the plac e.  This  was  a well
-
to
-
do, pr osper ous  town, about 1,000 J ewis h families in the town, 
s o a s ignific ant J ewis h population.  And c an you tell us  what your  parents  did for a living and your 

grandpar ents  and what their s tanding in plac e in the town was  pr ior  to Adolph Hitler?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann: 
 
I had two s ets of grandparents, obviously.  One lived in
 
--
 
it was  a pr ovinc ial 
headquar ters .  They had a wholesale leather  busines s  whic h celebr ated its  100th anniver sar y in 1933.  

They felt very s ec ur e; in fac t, so s ec ure that they didn't c ons ider em igr ating when we did bec aus e they 
s aid this  will blow over .
 
 
My other grandparents  lived in
 
Boynton
, whic h is  about 
20
 
m iles  away from Gliwic e.  In other 
words , my parents s ettled in Gliwic e bec aus e it was  within easy r eac h of both fam ilies .
 

> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Of the marital c om promis e.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Of both families .  They had a har dware s tore on the ma
in square.  They 

s tr uggled with a living but both m y father and his brother  went to c ollege.  My father 's  br other  was  an 
ec onomis t who, by the way, los t his  job in 1933 becaus e he worked for  the gover nm ent while m y father 
s tudied m edic ine and was a s urgeon
 
in Gliwic e.

Fleming:  So you wer e bor n at a tim e when at your  birth your  parents had a s ecur e 
exis tenc e, their par ents and gr andparents had been in then Germ any for dec ades  and you ar e born into 
a wor ld that c hanged rapidly.  And by the time you wer e in s c hool, in 1935
-
36, a whole new s et of 
r egulations  was  in plac e.  
 
 
What was  it like on a day
-
to
-
day bas is  in sc hool for you?  I k now J ewis h c hildren wer e 
s eparated fr om non
-
J ewis h c hildren.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, we had bas ically three c las sroom s within the s c hool, s eparate teac her s .  

The most danger ous part of the sc hool day was  rec es s , whic h was  around noon. We had to go 
outs ide.  And m or e or  less  the s afes t ar ea where we c ould go was  the dividing line between the boys  
and the gir ls
 
who were s epar ated on the playground.  And there we had our  teac her s m or e or les s  
keeping order.  We did get out five m inutes early s o that we c ould rus h home befor e the res t of the 
s c hool got out.

Fleming:  Do you r em ember  anything about your  neighbors  and how they treated 
you and your fam ily in thes e diffic ult year s  of the 
`
30s ? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Not r eally.  Bec aus e we were on the fir st floor
 
--
 
or what is  the s ec ond floor .  
Th
e neighbor s  would be ups tair s.  I had no neighbor  experienc e that way s inc e I m entioned
 
we lived 
downtown.  Downtown isn't like living in the s uburbs  where you know your  neighbor s.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And the other  J ewish fa
m ilies  in Gliwic e, did they liv
e nearby? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  It was n't that big a c ity.  We had a gr oup of about eight families  who s hared 
what was  c alled a 
[indis c ernible] 
garden whic h is  a plot of gar den maybe half an acr e whic h was  our 
s afe playground. We had c herr y tr ees , pear tr ee.  That was  a plac e wher e we went on weekends  or  

after  s c hool.  It was  a plac e wher e you c ould take an eas y bike r ide.  That was  kind of a s afe haven.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Do you r em ember  when your  parents  fir st started talking about tr ying 
to 
em igr ate? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My mother took  a trip to Is r ael in 1936
 w
ith her brother, found out that in Israel 
ther e's  one doctor for  every 100 people
. A
nd people with educ ation, phys icians  partic ularly, were 
working 
on c hicken farms  bec aus e ther e was  no way that he c ould c ontinue in his  profes s ion.  We 
s tarted to investigate els ewher e
 b
ec ause after 1936 we had war nings  that we have to make a c hange.
 
In fac t, before the end of the treaty, whic h I believe was  in J uly, m y par ents  had me go to the swim
m ing 
pool to take s wimm ing les s ons  bec aus e there was  a strong pos s ibility we would take an oc ean voy age 

and they wanted m e to lear n how to swim
, w
hic h I did.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  So your par ents already, by 1936, were inves tigating pos s ibilities .  An
d 
what about the res t of your  family at that tim e?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I m entioned befor e they felt s o s ec ure.  They s ur viv ed s tarv
ation in Wor ld War  I 
with s ome bartering becaus e they s old leather goods  to far mer s.  And the other  ones would s ay we 

don't
 
want to be bur dened.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And your  father, when did he los e the ability to prac tic e medic ine? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  They s tar ted having block ades  of the s o
-
c alled SR whic h wer e kind of beer hall 
Nazis  when Hitler  took  over
, a
s  s oon 
as the treaty was  over.  His pr actic e went down very s ubs tantially, 
als o los t his hos pital privileges  as  a s urgeon.  So he was  s till taking c ar e of s ome people who c hose to 

c om e but the SR people wer e threatening any non
-
J ews  with employm ent thr eats, that they would tell 
their boss es  and ther e would be c ons equenc es .
 

 
My gr andpar ents' bus ines s  went down fr om  that time fr om about 100,000 m arks, whic h was  at 
that tim e s ubstantial, to about 20 when the bus ines s  was  c onfis c ated during Kr is tallnac ht.  They had a 

non
-
J ewis h ac c ountant who kept the r ec or ds, whic h, by the way, is  in the museum files.  I donated 
thos e.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And we'r e lucky you did.
 
 
Your  father took a tr ip to the United States  in J une
 
1938.  Do you want to tell us  about that?
 
>> 
Fr ank  Lieberm ann:  Yes .  My grandfather did a genealogy study for m y par ents and found that a 
dis tant c ous in, not that dis tant but goes back  a gener ation befor e, em igr ated to the United States in 

1905.  And we als o had a his tory of another family, emigrate
d to the United States
 
--
 
r ather, to the 

4 
 
c olonies  in the middle 1700s and were a pr etty leading family in Philadelphia.  A book was  wr itten about 
the family and the c ollege.  So he went to the archives  in Philadelphia to see if ther e was  any fam ily 
who c ould help.  Unfor tunately Rebec c a never marr ied and her brother emigrated
 
--
 
r ather , went wes t 
to Louis ville and los t track .  Ther e was  no
 
--
 
s o the expedition to Philadelphia was  a bus t.  But he did 
find a son of the per s on who left, who had a s ubstantial job in New York and who eventually gave us  an 
affidavit.  That's  how we got to the United States .  He br ought that back .
 
An affidavit is  a s igned 
doc ument that we would not be on welfar e for one year  after arr ival.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And the quota 
was  quite small.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  25,000.  It was  r arely filled.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Ter rible.
 
 
Your  father went to the United States  in J une
 
1938.  You and your  mother
 
--
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  No.  He went in J anuary.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:
  
In January.  Ok .
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  At that point we got a number from  the State Department to be eligible for the 
quota in 1938.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And you and your mother followed in Oc tober.  So there was  this  gap 
wher e your  father was  in t he United States and you and your mother were still in Gliwice with c onditions  
wors ening all the tim e.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, we got our  vis a in the end of J une
 
1938.  My father took  the next boat 
bec aus e all money
 
--
 
all bank  ac c ounts  were fr ozen.  You c ould only withdraw enough to pr ove for 
living expenses .  It was  illegal to tak e any m oney out exc ept for  10 m arks, whic h is  about
 
$2.50.  By 
today's  inflation figur es, I put that as
 
$50.
 
 
In or der to live
 
--
 
if you took  a Germ an s hip, you wer e able to get a pr etty good s pending 
allowance on the s hip whic h c ould then be transferred out.  We us ed that for living expens es .  The vis a 
was  good for 120 days .  We purpos ely booked it after  three and a half m onths  s o that we had s ome 
m oney to live on when we arr
ived.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming: Was  your m other afraid? Were you afraid? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Fear  was n't an option.  If you dec ide to do s om ething, you do it.  Both par ents  

m ade up their m ind and we had to do whatever  we had to do.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fl
eming:  I r em em ber  r eading about a m edic al inc ident that you had when your 
father was  alr eady in the United States and you wer e back  with your m other.  Do you want to m ention 
that to the audienc e, and what being J ewis h meant in that s ituation? 
 
> > Fr ank  
Lieber mann:  In playing, there was  a building whic h we c ould use.  I took  my bic yc le to it and 
we wer e playing tag.  I fell.  I brok e my arm .  Or at leas t I fell and it hur t.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  So there was no way of c alling anybody, like
 
the polic e or  911.  I took  m y 
bic yc le and r ode home this  way, made it, for tunately.  My mother immediately c alled the orthopedist at 

the hos pital and was  told, s or r y, he is n't treating any J ewis h people and he c an't help.  She frantic ally 

got on the phone
 
and found an orthopedist in my grandpar ent's town in 
Boynton
, my father's par ents  
who, by the way, were no longer living ther e.  He s aid we s hould take a taxi to the Catholic  orphanage 

at the edge of town and take the fr eight
 
--
 
the delivery entr anc e.  He
 
would m eet us ther e.  He c hecked 
the arm and gave ins tr uctions  to my pediatr ic ian on what exerc is es  to do after I think s ix weeks , after  

the c ast c ame off.  That way that was  taken c ar e of.  My left arm  is fine.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Your poor  m other
 
with that fir st res pons e.
 
 
So in October
 
1938, you and your m other boar ded a s hip for the United States .  Can you tell 
us  about your  voyage? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  We took the Eur opa, whic h was  one of two s hips . We had a c abin way in the 

fr ont bec aus e we
 
took  the c heapes t c abin in fir st c las s  in order to get the spending allowanc e. When 
we got to Br em en, there was  no s hip. We were told the s hip would ar r ive the next day. We did boar d.  

We stayed over night.  And when we got on the ship, we found out th
a
t during the Munic h 
negotiations  
when England and France s old the Czec h Republic  down the r iver  without their c ons ent and gave away 

5 
 
the bor der ar ea with Germ any, Hitler  c alled back all s hips  at s ea as part of a war thr eat and the s hip 
was  c alled bac k and was  four days  late in September .  By October  it m ade up three of the days .  And 
we wer e the last one.  The s hip took  s ix days  to c r os s the Atlantic and one day to tur n ar ound.  
 
 
So it c aught up and we m ade the s hip in Oc tober  during the hurr ic ane s eas on w
h
er e my 
m other  was  ter r ibly s eas ic k , als o probably als o em otional exhaus tion.  At one point I was  one of s ix 
people in the dining room.  The other five s at at the c aptain's  table.  I had a table for m ys elf
, w
hic h I 
thought was  gr eat.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Before we leave Ger many altogether in your  s tory, what is your  best 
m em or y and your wor s t m emory pr ior to getting on that s hip in Oc tober
 
1938? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My bes t mem or y was  probably m y m other's family were exper t m us hr oom 

pi
c kers .  And they did this  on a year ly bas is , going to the c ountr y to a partic ular  forest.  I have no idea 
wher e it was .  And at the end of the picking they took  ever ything hom e.  It was  s pread out on the table.  

And anybody had veto power on every one of the m us hr ooms .  As you know, ther e ar e many different 
varieties .  And anyone vetoed they wer en't eaten.  And m y gr andmother  made wonderful feasts  with 
the m us hroom cr op.
 
 
Worst m em ory pr obably is  when m y m other's  brother cam e with us to Br emen and I s aw him
 
c aught
.  
> > Suzanne Brown

Fleming:  And you were 9 years  old at the time.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Yeah.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And wher e did you land in the United States?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  New Yor k.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And was  your father the
r e?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My father  picked us up.  He had c ome to New York by Greyhound.  I got a 
s ights eeing tour  on a two double
-
decker 
5th Avenue bus  which s howed me C
entr al 
P

W

S
ide.  We stayed two days .  And then we took  the em pire state expres s  to Cleveland wher e he 
had r ented a one
-
bedroom  apartment where I had a Mur phy bed.  I don't k now if you know what a 
Murphy bed is .  You open a door in the living r oom and you pull
 
the bed down.
 
[Laughter ] I thought that 
was  the gr eat invention.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  So a m onth following you had alr eady m entioned the Pogr om of the Night 
of Brok en Glas s  and your  family was  in Cleveland.  Do you want it tell us  how your  fam ily heard the 
news ?
 

> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  On the 9th of November we had been to Cleveland for  two and a half week s .  
My par ents  dec ided to as k  a neighbor  to look  in on me.  We wer e in an apartment hous e in Cleveland.  
They went to a Wednes day night m ovie s pec ial.  I don't know if it was 10 cents  or whatever it 
was.  I 
think  it was  fr om  8:00
 
to 10:00.  At about 9:00, the phone rang.  I got a pers on
-
to
-
per s on phone c all 
fr om  m y grandparents.  I knew it was  bad bec ause we're 3:00
 
in the m or ning.  Sinc e it was  
per s on
-
to
-
per s on I didn't talk to anybody but I hear d c o
nver s ations  on the other s ide.  That was  the 
pr obably wors t hour of my life until m y parents  c ame hom e.  I knew things were bad.  I didn't know what 

it was .  And I had to s pill the beans had they c ame back.  That was  Kr is tallnac ht.  The bus ines s was  
c onfis
c ated.  Two of my m other 's br others  wer e im pr is oned.  That was  tec hnic ally the start of the 
Holoc aus t.  In other wor ds , we es c aped it.  And I cons ider m ys elf a witnes s  r ather than a s urvivor  

bec aus e I didn't go thr ough that part but many other people her e 
did.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And what happened to the brother that s aw y ou 
c aught

I don't want to go too 
long but we had an interes ting experienc e.  He applied for  the 
M

S
oc iety, whic h was  at that tim e a 
lic ens e to good standing.  Shortly after  he applied they c alled an em ergency m eeting on a Friday night 
which
 
is  a Jewis h Shabbat and pas s ed an ex post fac to law requir ing c itizens hip for members hip.  In 
other wor ds , in tr ying to veto his  adm is s ion.
 
Somebody, we never  knew who it was, c alled the 
news papers  in outr age.  On the following Sunday ther e was an editorial in the "The Dayton Herald" on 
fr eedom of oppor tunity in the United States.  The next day he had 11 new patients

es tablis hed.
 
 
By the way, als o after  that veto he had a vi
sit from the Chief of Staff of Good Samaritan 
H

We felt very for tunate that we res ettled.  I had a ver y, very happy childhood in Dayton.  He

he volunteered for the Army but ther e was  s uc h a s hor tage of doc tor s 
that he was  r ejected.  They wanted people under  40

Bas ic ally that's  the end of that s tor y exc ept that we didn't know what was  happening dur ing all 
ofWorldWar II becaus e m y grandparents were in Ther es ienstadt until 1944.  We never hear d from  my

es tablis hed the Final Solution and how to do it.  But the German nam e was  prevalent pr etty m uc h fr om 

the beginning.

exc luded as  a staff m ember  c ons idered worthy of s uc h an im por tant job to the Reic h.  The euthanas ia 

pr ogram , I think , began in the late 1930's.  But no J ewis h phys ic ian would have been allowed to be

or 
your  own s afety.
 
 
Does  that ans wer your ques tion?

Fir s t of all, Mr.

thr ough.

What was  the greatest challenge that you fac ed when you wer e tr ying to m ake s ome pea
c e with 
your  pas t and everything you went thr ough? Was ther e any moment that you were in a c er tain building 

and r emembered s om ething?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I bas ic ally feel that hate is a dangerous  thing.  You have to c om e to ter ms  with 
whatever  happened and r eac t in a thoughtful way that's  going to be c onstr uc tive.
 
I s aid I didn't want to 
go back until ther e was  another oc c as ion but I just felt grudges don't ac c omplis h anything.  So I don't

about the history.  He was  very
