This  fir st s lide you s ee is  one of Fr ank as  a baby.  Fr ank  Liebermann was  the only c hild of 
Hans  and Lotte Liebermann.  On the left we s ee Hans  Lieberm ann.  And on the right we see Lotte and 
her  infant s on, Frank .
 
 
Both of Frank's par ents' families  had lived in this  par t of Germ any, now Poland, for s everal 
generations .  Frank  is  pic tur ed her e with his  paternal gr andpar ents, Bernar d and J enny Lieberm ann.
 
 
Adolf Hitler c ame to power in 1933.  When Fr ank  began s c hool in 1935, J ewis h s tudents  wer e 
s epar ated fr om the non

In 1936, Frank's  father  was  no longer able to practic e medic ine as  a result of Nazi anti

J ewis h 
laws .  In 1938, the fam ily  tried to obtain vis as  to com e to the United States.  Hans  tr aveled first and

Fr ank and his  m other  followed a few m onths later in October of 1938.  Here we s ee Frank 's  m other's

It is  now my pleas ur e to invite to the stage Frank Lieberm ann.

> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Sur e
.  I
f we c ould lower the lights  a tiny bit
,  
that would be gr eat. 
 
 
Firs t of all, Fr ank , thank  you s o m uc h for being here with us  today and sharing your  
experienc e
.  I thought we m ight start with s ome of your  ear lies t c hildhood m em or ies  about life in 
Gliwic e and what you c an r em em ber .
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Gliwic e was  a c ity of a little over 100,000.  We lived on the 
m
ain 
s
tr eet.  What 
was  c om mon at that tim e, m y fa
ther had his  offic e in the rooms when you c ame in
; w
e had an 
apar tm ent in the back .  So it was  a c ombination, apartment.  Clos e to everything, inc luding the str eet 
c ar .
 
 
I c am e fr om a very nic e hous e.  My father  was  a ear , nos e, throat s urgeon.  My mother  
was  
ac tive in the c omm unity.
 
 
One of the major things I r em em ber  was  pr obably 1934, my father  bought his  firs
t c ar.  It was  
s m aller  than a VW
  
It didn't have a gas gauge but ther e was  a tank which you filled up with gas.  When 
you r an out of gas, you us ed the s ec ond tank  and then headed for the gas s tation.  They bas ic ally got 
that in or der  to vis it m y father's
 
--
 
well, both par ents  were anywher e fr om  20 to 50
 
m iles  in either 
dir ec tion.  Cars  were a luxury at that time s inc e ever ybody c ould r eac h ever y place by s tr eet c ar.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  That br ings  to bear  another ques tion I had for  you.  Can you tell us a little 
about your  extended family in Gliwic e and around the ar eas ? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  My mother's  fam ily lived in Poland, about 50
 
m iles 
northwes t.  They had a 
wholes ale leather bus ines s  and tanner y.  In fact, the bus ines s  c elebrated its  100th annivers ary in 1933.  
They felt very s ec ur e in the community
 w
hic h ultim ately bec am e their demis e bec ause they felt Hitler  
would be over .  They s urvived s tarvation in World War I and they'll s ur vive that als o.  Unfortunately they 
didn't. 
 
 
My father's  par ents had a har dwar e store a little bit eas t of Gliwic e.  In other  wor ds , my father 
and m other s ettled in the middle.  So they wer en't too far away.
 
 M
y m other had three younger  br others .  My father had a br other who was  a c ouple of years  
younger , an ec onom ist.  He los t his job almost imm ediately in 1933 bec aus e he worked for the 

gover nm ent.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  That was  bec aus e of the 1933 Apr il c
ivil s er vice law.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Cor rect.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Bar ring any J ewis h pers on from working for the gover nm ent.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Cor rect.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Do you have a favorite c hildhood mem or y fr om Germany? 
 
> > Fr ank
 
Lieberm ann:  Not r eally.  I don't play favor ites .
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  [Laughter]
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I do r em em ber
 
--
 
I was  kidded about it for a long tim e.  
The f
irs t time we wer e 
on the way, after getting the c ar, we pas s ed a farm and I s aw s ome c ows  on the s ide
.  I s aid, "G
ee, 
what funny looking hors es ."  Bec aus e hors es  at that tim e wer e still us ed for trans portation in the c ity for 

m ilk  deliveries  and all kinds  of things.  But c ows  were new to m e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  You s tarted s c hool in 1935 at a public  s c hool.  Can you tell us a little bit 
about that?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, it was  a public  s c hool whic h bec am e s egr egated. We had three 
c las s r ooms.  This  was  for  the thr ee gr ades
:  f
ir s t, sec ond and third gr ade.  We h
ad our own teac hers .
 

3 
 
The s c ar y par t that I remem ber was  r ec es s.  We had to go out for r ec es s .  That was  c ons idered 
danger ous . We us ually tried to s tay ver y c los e to our  teac her s between the boys  and the gir ls who 
were s epar ated
 
--
 
s eparated and c ouldn't wait until rec es s was  over .  It was  s c ar y. 
 
We als o wer e told 
to get to sc hool about five minutes  later  than anybody els e. We were dism is s ed about five m inutes  

ear lier.  It was  dangerous .  People were beaten up.  Es pec ially, we bec am e notic eable as gr oups .
  
Individually I went all over  but as gr oups, you were too eas ily identified.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  How did your teac her s  treat you? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  They were author itar ian her e, es pec ially m y 
s ec ond grade teac her .  The fir
st 
grade was  Mis s  David who was  very motherly.  The s ec ond one was  an autoc rat.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I c ould s ay probably German m entality. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  In 1936, I know that the s ituation for  your  family bec ame m uc h m or e 
diffic ult and danger ous . 
 
Do you want to s ay a little bit about the year 1936 and what that m eant for your  
family? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  If you s tudy his tor y, you will know that after Wor ld War I ther e was  a
 
Crimean 
W
ar whic h led to the establis hm ent of Poland as  a c ountr y betwee
n Rus s ia and Germany.  The bor ders 
were unoffic ial.  Gliwic e was  very c los e to the border .  The areas within a c er tain distanc e of the 

bor der s were protec ted by the tr eaty agains t any pr ejudic e bec ause it gave eac h c ountr y 15 years
 
--
 
it 
gave the Germ ans  a
 
c hanc e to get out of Poland.  That tr eaty was  over  in 1936.  We were war ned to be 
c ar eful. 
 
At that time m y father los t his hos pital privileges .  Shor tly beforehand m y parents told m e that 
we might take an oc ean voyage and I better learn to s wim .  And that the swimm ing pool would be 
c los ed after 1930, c los ed to us
 i
n 1936.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Clos ed to the J ewish.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Yes.  As  well as  c ertain events , ins titutions , like movies , s imilar  plac es . 
 
I r em ember that, I think , in May of 19
36, m y grandfather c am e with m e to the pool and s aid
, ﬁI
'm not 
leav ing here until you tak e a tes t in deep water.
ﬂ 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Oh, boy.  [Laughter]
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I've enjoyed swimm ing ever s inc e. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Your father  lost his  ability to pr ac tic e as  a s ur geon. What happened to 
his  practic e and his office? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, num ber one, he c ouldn't us e the hos pital.  The Germ an s ys tem  depended 

on health ins ur anc e whic h bec am e c los ed to him.  So we wer e fortu
nate
 
--
 
we got early war ning that 
things wer e going to get wor s e.  My parents  started s erious ly to look  for  choic es  to go. 
 
 
Eventually m y grandfather on my mother 's s ide, was  a genealogis t, and he dis c over ed a 
dis tant relative who was  kind of the black s heep of the family who had emigrated to the United States  in 
1905
 a
nd was  living in New Yor k. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Ok .
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  January
 
1938, after doing thorough inves tigations, m y father went to the United 
States, als o to look  up other
 
r elatives  bec aus e being a genealogis t
. O
ne of the women on my m other's 
s ide, m ar ried Mic hael Gr ant, who was  one of the pioneer fam ilies  to s ettle in Philadelphia.  And in fac t, 

they es tablis hed a c ollege in Philadelphia.
  
Am ong other things, m y father wen
t to the Arc hives  to find 
out what happened to the family.  Unfortunately, s tayed a s ingle wom an and her brother em igr ated to 

the wes t; 
nam ely
, Louis ville, Kentucky.  They los t trac e. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  How did your fam ily  make ends m eet between 1936 and 1938? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  That was  tough.  Bas ic ally , in or der to get a vis a to the United States  you had to 

get an affidavit fr om s omebody that you won't be on welfare for a year.  The time was  1938, whic h was  
the s ec ond par t of the 
G
reat 
D
epr e
s s ion.  The way we s uppor t
 
--
 
actually, my parents  bought first clas s  
tic k ets on a Germ an boat bec aus e there you c ould get a pr etty s ubs tantial s pending allowanc e to be 

us ed on the tr ip.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Ahh.
 

4 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  That basic ally s upported us pr obably for the first year  of our res idenc e bec ause 
we never us ed any of the affidavit giver's funds dur ing that time. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And your  father was  able to leave in J une
 
1938? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  We got the affidavit in J anuar y and we got a number to be on the lis t of people 
apply ing.  The quota for Germ any was  25,000 people.  Obvious ly there were m any mor e who wanted to 
go.  That's  the r eas on the affidavits  wer e ver y, ver y res tr ic tive.
  
Generally, by the way, that quota 
was  
not filled for that r eas on. 
 
 
Ac tually, nothing happened.  My father  c alled a friend of his  in Ber lin and said
, ﬁ
What's  
happening?  I've had this  num ber .  Do you have any idea how I can find out how long this  is going to 

las t bec aus e things ar en't gett
ing any better ?
ﬂ
  
He s aid
, ﬁW
ell, the c oun
s el
 
has  a sec r etar y by the nam e 
of Fraulein Schmidt.  If you get her a nic e box of c andy, maybe that's  going to help.
ﬂ 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  [Laughter]
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  A month later nothing happened.  He
 
c alled his  fr iend again and he s aid
, ﬁW
ell, 
did you put a hundred marks  into the box of c andy?
ﬂ
  
And my father was  a ver y s tr aight and nar row and 
he s aid, "I didn't know you had to do that."  He got a sec ond box of c andy.  About a week later  we were 
c alle
d to get a phys ic al at the Am eric an Embas s y.
 
 
We got the vis a in J une.  It was  good for 120 days .  Sinc e my father had to take s tate boards 
in order to practic e in the United States, m y m other was  left to c los e the hous ehold and we took  our  

tic k ets at the end of the 120 days  bec aus e all funds
 
--
 
all bank  acc ounts  wer e fr ozen in 1936.  You 
c ould only take out enough for living
 
--
 
what was  determined living expens es .  And anything over that 
m ade you s ubjec t to arr est.  You c ouldn't take any m oney out of Germa
ny.  The amount was  10 marks, 
whic h is  about
 
$2.50 a per s on.  That explains  how we m anaged and why I think  my father  was  studying 
in Cleveland he had a room  for
 
$5 a week. We lived frugally and s urvived.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming: What was  that like in thos e 120 days  wher e your father  had left and you 
and your m other wer e still in Germ any? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Tough.  Firs t of all, the fam ily was broken. We had already given up the 

apar tm ent.  In fac t, we had quite an inc ident over that.  The equivalent
 
of the leas e is  that you give the 
landlord mortgage.  After all, he had an offic e and he wanted to m ake s ure that he didn't have to move 
s hor t
-
term.  When you canc eled the leas e, the money was  r efunded and he asked for it to be 
tr ansferr ed to his bank.  Som ebody at the landlord's  bank notified the Gestapo that somebody m ade a 

lar ge withdr awal fr om the bank and they s aid investigate.  Two agents  c am e in and s aid "
Yo
u'r e under 
ar r est."  We s aid, "F
or  what?"  For withdr awing funds .  Said they were tr ansfer to
 
m y bank .
 
Very fortunate.  He c alled his  bank  and the bank  pr es ident vouc hed that they got the depos it and that it 

is  s till in the ac c ount.  And they left us.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Thank  God. 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  When we were ready to pac k
 
--
 
at tha
t tim e we could s till take belongings in the 
lift, whic h is  like a c ontainer, pr oviding we paid 100% tax of whatever we had.  And it had to be used.
 
We did take most of our  s maller  furniture, offic e supplies ; in other  words , ins truments .  And m y m other 

als
o bought a s ewing m ac hine that in c as e things got r ough, s he could s ew our own clothes .  That was  
pac ked up with a c us toms ins pec tor when the time c am e who was  then c hec ked on. 
 
 
We als o had a pretty tough experienc e at that time.  There was  a hous e whic h had a backyar d 
whic h was  c onver ted into a playground where we played tag.  I pr om ptly br oke m y arm .
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Oh, no. 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  At that time one did not c all
 
--
 
ther e was  no 911.  One didn't c all the polic e 
bec aus e the polic e were not your  fr iends.  So I did s omething whic h we would c ons ider  outrageous.  I 

took m y bic yc le and rode hom e holding m y arm lik e this .  This is  on the 
m
ain 
s tr eet, like Connectic ut 
A
venue, exc ept it didn't have a lot of car s .  So it was n't heavy traffic
. 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  [Laughter]
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  So my mother  got on the phone and c alled the loc al orthopedis t.  And he s aid, 

" I
'm s orr y.  I don't take Jewis h patients."  She frantic ally got on the phone and found s omebody in my 
father's hom etown who s aid, "
L
ook , I'll take c ar e of you.  Take a taxi to the bac kdoor of the Catholic  

5 
 
or phanage.  I'll meet you ther e."  Whic h we did.  He s et m y arm, put it in a c as t.  My pediatric ian took  
c ar e of it after  s ix weeks  to tr y to get the m ovement back . 
 
We developed ins tinc t on what we c an and 
c an't do.  That's  how we adapted. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  So you'r e 9 or 10 year s  old, I believe, when y ou boar ded the s hip with 
your  mother  to c om e to the United States.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Yes .
 
> > Suzanne Br
own
-
Fleming: What was  the jour ney like? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  It was  in October
 
1938 dur ing hurr ic ane s eas on.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Oh, no.  [Laughter]
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  We had the c heapest first c las s s eat, c abin, whic h was  in the
 
extrem e fr ont of 
the boat.  I r em em ber
 
--
 
s o that you had that elevator effec t going up and down.  In fact, I was  
fasc inated by watc hing from the promenade deck  as  the bow of the ship literally dove into the waves  

and then c ame up and when it got to the water  level, it m ade a quick  jum p up.  It was  fas c inating but it 
was  not c omfortable at night.  And my mother  never  left the cabin during the whole week until we wer e 
c los e to arr ival. 
 
 
At one tim e I was  one of s im ple in the firs t c las s  dining r oom.  The other  five s at at the 
c aptain's table.  I had m y own table.  [Laughter]
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming: What was  it like to see your father again?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Oh, he met us in New York. We had a wonderful reunion.  He intr oduc ed me to 
the Americ an dr ink whic h was  a 
C
oke.  I thought it was  c ocoa.  [Laughter ]
 
 
And we promptly went to Cleveland.  My father had r ented a s mall, one
-
bedroom apartm ent 
with a Murphy bed, whic h was  my introduction to s leeping in the United States .
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Oh 
my gos h.
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  I s till think  fondly about that.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  And what happened to all the family that was  not able to tak e a s hip to 
the United States ? 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Well, on November
 
6, my par ents  took  advantage
 
--
I  
think  it was  a Wednes day 
wher e ther e was  a movie s pec ial of 10 cents per per s on.  Rem ember, we have had a lot of inflation.  In 
thos e days  you c ould buy a c ar for under
 
$1,000. 
 
They asked a neighbor to kind of look  in on m e.  
They told m e they would be b
ack ar ound 10:00.  At maybe 8:30, the phone r ang.  The per s on c alled for 

m y gr andpar ents.  8:30 was  2:30 in the m or ning s o I knew enough that this  was  not an or dinar y c all.  It 
was  a per s on
-
to
-
per s on c all for my mother .  That was  the longest hour that I r e
m ember in m y life.
 
 
When they finally did c ome hom e, they found out that my mother's  br others  had been 
ar r ested, that the bus ines s  had been c onfis c ated.  This  was  Kr istallnac ht, whic h was  the beginning of 

the Holoc aus t.  It was  c alled the Night of Broken Glas s , when all windows wer e s m as hed, s ynagogues  
were burned, and the Holoc aus t bec ame s er ious .
 
 
I s aid I c onsider  m ys elf a witnes s  because I was  fortunate due to our ear ly warning we got out 
before all hell br oke loose. 
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming: Wer e any
 
other family mem bers  able to get out of Germ any bes ides  your  
father and your m other and your s elf?
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  Unfortunately not bec aus e my father imm ediately went to the per s on who gave 
us  the affidavit.  I found out he had a his tor y
 
--
 
I said he was  a black sheep.  His  father c ame to m y 
great grandfather  in 1905 and s aid he s imply needed to borrow
 
$3,000, whic h was  a lot of m oney.
 
> > Suzanne Brown
-
Fleming:  Yeah. 
 
> > Fr ank  Lieber mann:  For  the week .  He never
 
--
 
he took the next s hip to the United States  not to be 
hear d from  again and alm os t was  c los e to dr iving the bus ines s  to bank ruptc y.  But they did s ur viv e.

In fact, I'd s ay part of m y las t word, whic h I us ually  s ave for the end but it's  appr opriate for the

when I talked about Fr aulein Sc hm idt, that's  not alone.  Hundr eds  of 
people were given vis as  by c ounsels  whic h were invalid.  You heard of people going on to St. Louis  

with fake vis as .  One of the les s ons  that I tr ied to pers uade people to lis ten to is  that when tim es  are

The 
question was , when you c am e to the United States , how awar e were you of events  that c ontinued to

for ins tanc e, fr om 
Ther esiens tadt

It became obvious  what was  happening.  But I'd als o like to s ay that due to World War

I've been retir ed for 20 years. 
 
 
I've kind of m ade peac e with Ger many.  It's  now thr ee generations  and I'm abs olutely appalled 
over  the fact that when I went to s c hool, the Civil War was  anc ient his tor y.  Today, 1940 is  about the 

s am e timefr am e.  I try to keep that in m ind when I s peak  to young people.  But the les s ons that we get

at one of the tr ibes  of the

when the m em o

c ouldn't do it.  That's  why I s ay about the generations . 
 
Fir s t of all, the people you hate don't know it.  
So it's abs olutely a c ounter pr oductive pr oc edure.  It only hur ts yours elf.  Bec aus e it limits  you.  It's  als o 

why I volunteer her e.

whic h was  thr ee years ago.  We went from

it was  part
 
Holland, part Germ any, part
