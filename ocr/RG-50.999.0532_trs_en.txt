T hen with that, I'd like to invite up Halina. 
 
[Applause]
 
Good morning. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Good m orning. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Can ever ybody hear usOK?T hat's great.W e've got closed captioning going on on 

the side here too.Pay no attention to it unless you need it.OK? 
 
 
Good morning, Halina. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Good m orning, Vincent. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: How are you today? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Fine.T hank you for being with m e today. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Good. Thank youfor com ing and speaking with us about your experiences during 

the Holocaust.W hy don't you tell us a little bit about where you grew up, your lif ebefore the war. 
 
>> Ha lin
a Peabody:  Sure. OK. I was born inKrakow, as you mentioned. It was abeautif ulcity. M y 
m other andm y fatherwere bothf rom Krakow. All thef am ily is f rom Krakow. My m other andfather 

when they got marriedthey m oved to Zaleszczyki, which also you mentioned. Because m yfather was 

a beginning dentist and wantedtobe ina smaller placeto start his surgery. 
 
 
Zaleszc zyki was a lovely little town, alm ost com pletely surrounded by the River Niest. T hat 
was a naturalborder with Romania. In the m iddleof  the river were boys, you couldn't gofurther than 

them iddle of the river. W ehad lotsof  water sports there. My m other was a cham pion swim m er in 

1925. She was a champion of Poland, so shewas happy to have the water there,and we had 

kayaks. I had a little paddle.W eused to paddlef rom  one
 
--
 
we hadtwo beaches, Shady Beach and 
Sandy Beach; we'd go f rom  one place toanother, spend a lot of time on the beach. It was really a 

beautif ul place. 
 
 
W ehad a very nice house. W ehad grapes growing there, apricots in t
he  s um m e r .  T he 
weather was perfect,because they hadfourdifferent seasons.Alsowe could go over to Rom aniaf or 

theday. Just geta pass to go over. 
 
 
My f ather, obviously, practiced hisdentistry. My m other took care of m e. She did wonderf ul 
things f or m e because I was the f irst one. 
 

[Laughter]
 
W ell, I had lots of  bicyc les, tricycles. I had the prom ise of  a grand piano f rom  m y grandparents f rom  

Krakow, which never m aterialized, butI always regret that I don'tplay the piano. 
 
 
Anyway, as I said,m y m other had also other talents. She was a wonderf ul knitter, and she 
em broidered beautifully. She would knit lace.Ever ything in thehouse was her work. She knitted all 

m y clothes, which really ate m e up because it was wool. 
 

[Laughter]
 
She said Ihad to wear it. From top tobottom ,I was alwa ys in wool. 
 

 
She taughtme alsotoskate whenI was 5 years old,because she liked every sport in sight. 
She would takem e, 5years old I was ver y nice andf ree, skating wit h her.She also skied.Sheplayed 

 
 
3
 
tennis. She rode horses. She was in every sp ort possible, buthermain thing was s wim m ing, of 
course.As I said, we had a lotof  prizes she got, which are gone. 
 
 
T his was the lif e that I had, justuntil I was about6
 
3/4. At thatpoint, Septem ber1939, 
suddenly ever ything stopped and, unfortunately, the war was starting. Now, at thatage, Ihad just 

understood that therewas going to be problem s and we were all tryi ng to keep calm . 
 
 
My f ather was worried about the rations com ing in, as were othermen,becausePoland wa
s 
divided betweenGermany and Russia at thatpoint, and a partof Poland was going to be occupied by 

the Russians.Som y m other knew that there was dangerf or them en, because they would conscript, 

the Russians liked to conscript the youngm en into the Arm y, which was like 20 years of  hard labor. 

T hey couldn't get out. A lot ofm en, som etook fam iliesas well, crossed over to Romaniato escape 

f rom  the Russians'occupation. 
 
 
Howe ver, m y f ather was worried because we hada 2
-
m o nt h
-
old sister. He was worried
 
th at f o r 
thebaby it won't be convenient, won'tbe goodf or thebaby. So hewent over by him self.T he 

Russians occupied us. Som epeople just lef t.W ekept quiet at hom e. I don't rem ember anything 

particularly in that case, what the Russiansdid. I know thatthey dem anded various jewelr y and 

m oney and whatever they could get, but we weren't rich so I don't think we were affectedm uch in any 

wa y .  
 
 
At any rate, after afew weeks andeverything kind of got settleddown, afew of  the peoplewho 
ran away so fast decided they would try to com eback,maybe it was OK.T hey tried quietly to cross 

over the river, which was by then com pletely iced over, and they wer e just kind of creeping back. 

Unfortunately, the Russians had sealed the border by then,andthey were all caught, allput inprison. 

My f ather got trial and they gave him  20 years hard labor inSiberia, because they said hewas a spy. 

As I said, adentist was a spy. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: 20 years?W ow. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  He crossed, tried to come back, they
 
said he was a spy.W e lost m yfather 
im mediately. Not only that, you see, the Russian law was if  one person was a crim inal, again,m y 

father, then the rest of thefam ily was also going to Siberia.W e were already packed, ready to go.But 

for som e unknown 
reason, they didn't take us. However, they threw us out of ourhouse,because 
they said it was bourgeois, we couldn't have a house. 
 
 
T hey threw us out.W e went to this place calledT ouste, justaf ew m iles up the road,nottoo 
far, another small town. That picture where you see m y baby sister andm eand m y mother, that was 

where we spent the whole Russian occupation. 
 
 
I went to school, the Russiansdecided thatthe kids could go to school, but they all were 
droppedone class becausethey wanted to indoctrinate us into being com munists, and they tried to 

teach us Russian. I rem em ber learning a little bit to write the Russian lettering and all that. 
 

 
At thatpointthat's all we could do is sit andwait.W e hadno contact with ourf atherfor quite a 
wh ile .  B
efore the Germans cam e in we had acouple of  lettersf rom him , andm y m other was ableto 
senda package to him, but then theGermans decided they were goi ng to take over the whole of 

Poland, so the Russians justdisappeared. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt:  Let m e back
 
itupa littlebit.W e're talking about 1940or so. You're about 8 years 
old. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right. Yes. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: You've been kicked outof  your hometown of  Zaleszc zyki. Your dad is off in Siberia 

som ewhere. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Correct. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt:W ith your baby sister, your m om  is taking care of thefamily. 
 

 
 
4
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Then in 1941, in June,theNazis declare war on the Soviet Union, right? They 
invade the easternpart of Poland, Soviet occupied
 
Poland anddeclare one Soviet Union.W hat 
happened at that point? 
 

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, the Russians disappeared.T hey didnotf ight.They just disappeared.W e 

just took our things back, we went back andsettled back in our house. 
 
>> V in ce n t S la tt: 
 
I n  Zale szc zyki?  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. W e waitedfor the next occupier. Nobody knew what to expect.The Nazis, 

the Germans came inwith greatf anf are, big noise,onm otorcycles, the SS came on motorcycles with 

black unif orm s. I rem em berbecauseI was standing watching them com ing down. I remember m y 

m other pulledm e away so I wouldn't stand in f ront so I wouldn't bevisible. 
 

 
T hey im m ediately put in various laws. T he curf ew, no schoolf or Jewish children.W e were not 
allowed to go to parks. W e were not
 
allowedm any things,and of course rations, very, ver y stringent 
rationsforf ood, yellow stars on housesand on ourarm bands. 
 
 
Ever y Jewish person had to be working f or the Germ ans. Now, if there was no particular jobf or 
som ebody, they would m ake them clean the sidewalks. My m other, because they knew, they had lists 

of  all the Jewish com munity, and m y mother,who as I said was a knitter, and knew ver y we ll how to 

work in that area, they said that she would bethe chief  knitterfor them ayor of  thetown, who was 

obviously Germ an. Hehad lots of children. So that was m y m other's job. Shehad to do theknittingf or 

the children, and 
of course lookedaf ter thefam ily. 
 
 
Again, everybody was very cooperative and tried to be helpful, just to see everything's goin g to 
be quiet. 
 
 
T he Germ ans createda com m ittee of the Jewish leaders in that town, and the Germ answould 
demand, not request,
 
demand groupsof  people f or various jobs. If they had something tobe done, 
they would say,W e need so
-
an d
-
somany people,they need to report to us in them orning. 
 
 
T hen they would betaken out wherever they neededtodo the job,then in the evening the
y 
would com e back.T his happeneda couple, two, three tim es,and as I saideverybody was  ver y, ver y 

cooperative. 
 
 
T hen they dem andeda rather large group ofpeople thistime.T hey said they neededthem to 
cover the trunks of trees for the winter, because it was a very se vere winter there. So they needed 

burlap, just wrap the tree trunks with theburlap so they wouldn't f reeze in the winter. 
 

 
Again, people, mostly young people, congregated in the square, and they marched them up 
the road.There was an old Polishm ilitary cam p where this was going to be done. As they were 

talking, I mean, as they were being walked out, if  there were any people with yellow stars they would 

just get them as well. That's how it ended. 
 
 
T hey walked out, we were waiting f or them
 
tocom e back. And nobody was com ing back. 
Evening cam e, nobody was com ing back. Everybody got ver y anxious. Finally, in theevening, 

towards theevening, one man cam eback,had been shot in the arm , and he told us what happened. 

W hat it was is that when they got to the cam pthey found out that there was an open grave with 

planksover it, and they were told toundress, lay down on the planks, and they were shot.As they 

were shot, they dropped in. 
 
 
T hism an, who survive d, was one of the lastof  the people 
there to be shot. They m issed his 
heart. Hem anaged,af ter they lef t,todrag himself out and come back and told us what happened. 

W eat thatpoint understood the situationand what was going to happen. Then everybody was ver y 

traumatized and lost about 600 people, young people. First thing they were doing was looking f or 

 
 
5
 
hiding places, because what we im agined and understood was theywere going to do it again. Only 
thef irsttim e they lied what it was going to be, but nobody was going to believe next tim e.
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Now that youfully knew what was going on, whatwould happen, can you tell us 

m oreaboutthe other actions they were going to organize? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. Everybody was wai ting, not knowing whatwas going to be the next thing. 

S
o the next tim e they needed,again, they said this tim ethey wanted people to go to Germ any f or 
work, which was norm al, because they alwa ys needed peoplef or work in Germany. But nobody 

believed them, and whoever couldhidehid. 
 
 
W e wentover to a lady who usedto cookforus, and stayed there the whole day and waited 
until the evening. Once they had the numberof  people, they loadedthem  on the train and they went. 
 

 
T henaf terthat, there were very f ew Je ws left, because it wasn't a very big com m unity.W
ha t  
they did was to throw the restof the Jews out of  the town, and they sentus againto Jaroslav
 
--
 
no, 
so rry, T o u ste. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Jaroslav we'll get to a m inute. Right now, it's T ouste. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, T ouste.W ehad som epeople we knew there already.We were told where 

to go, it was com munal housing.W hat we discovered was thatnotonly our community, whi ch was so 

reduced inT ouste, there were other comm unities all around.T his he did the same thing
 
--
 
they did 
the same thing, killed as m any as they could, then got usall togetherinto this little town. It later 

becam ea ghetto,but at that point it was justwe had to live in this comm unities. 
 
 
T hef irst thing everybody did was tof indhiding places, of course.W hatmy m other said tom
e 
was that what they're going to do is to gof inda hiding place, then they'll move us again. So it's 

not
 
--
 
there's no hope.T here was no way, we hadnowhere to go, nowhere to run. So theystarted 
looking. My m otherthought she was going to sendthe children to Rom ania.There were som etrips 

planned in the dark, during the night.Butnothing worked. Bef ore weknew it, they had again 

demanded the group to go to work in Germ any, and so everybody scattered around again, having 

found whatever hiding place they
 
could. A lotof  people went into the basem entsand hidthat way. 
 
 
My m other, because she had known som epeople there, decided to go a different way. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt:W hat did she decidetodo? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She decided to aska coupleof  farm ers to keep
 
--
 
one keptm e, the other one, 
whom  shepaid in advance, she was going tokeepher with m y sister during the day, the whole day. I 

was up in the loft with one, she was with theotherone. 
 
 
During the day, as I was up in the lof t, the lady who keptm e kept com ing backand tellingm e 
who they caught.T hey caught this one andthat one,and I knew them  all.They were already in the 

square, having been caught.T here were peoplef rom  thehouse we were in, andI know there was 

one lady particularly that heardm e, because she hada baby. She ref used to go into the hiding. They 

wouldn't take herunless she gave the child som ething to sleep. She just stayedand she letthem  take 

her. Shehad waited many, m any years f or achild, and I remember it ver y well. It was ver y painful to 

hear that she was caught. And all the others, of  course,as well. 
 

 
So I kept thinkingm y m other was caught.I kept worryin g all day long about that.T owards the 
evening, when they had the right num ber loadedand on the train, 
Iwa ite d  fo r my mo the r. A s I sa id, I 

wasn't sure whether she was com ing or not.But she did com e to pick m e up withm y sister. She told 

m e whathappened toher, which was that the lady who kept her gotscared in the m iddleof theday 

and threw her out. T he
re was an em ptyf ield, andthere was onebush, and she said she crouched by 
thatbushf or the rest of the day with m y sister, and she said there were airplanesf lying, they were 

lookingf or people, and somehow, by somem iracle, they didn't see her. That's how she survi ved 

through the day. 
 

 
 
6
 
 
She worried all day long that I was caught. So she said never againwi ll we separate. 
W hatever happens, we wil l go together.T hatwas her decision, and that's what we're going to do. Of 
course, you know, I agreed.There were notm any choices. 
 
 
So they looked around and they thoughtabout what could we do, and they cam e up with this 
idea that since we were threef emales, that perhaps we could getawa y by pretending tobe Catholic. 

Most of Poland is Catholic. It's like 99%.So that's theonly possibility that we had. 
 
 
So they, thef riends ofm y m other, they bought papers with a new identity, f rom a priest in 
T ouste, and we got new nam es andeverythi ng new, and grandparentsand birthplace. My m other sat 

m e down and taught m
e all the new things that I had to know, thebirthplace, the date, everything was 
different. She said,m y sister obviously was too young, so we couldn't tell her anything, so she said 

that we have to
 
--
 
that's what we have to do. 
 
 
I didn't know anything about the Catholic religion, of course. Ididn't know m uchaboutm y own. 
I was ver y young. All Irem ember knowing is that I had to crossm yself going in and out ofchurch, 

with m y ri ght hand.T hat was what I knew. 
 
 
So ourf riends took us to the train, and we loadedus in.W e had twosuitcases left.That was all 
left of ourthings. A little money ourf riends collectedfor m y mother.Weboardedthe train.W eknew 

thatthe trip to Jaroslav is going to takef our days andfour nights, with some changes.W hythey
 
chose Jaroslav, I don't know. It was about halfwa y to Krakow. No reason actually. 
 

 
I said goodbye toourfriends,and we started to travel. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: By this tim e, youhadn't seen your father in three years? Right? Youhadn't had any 

news f rom  
h im .  
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely no contact. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: He'd been sent to Siberia. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Correct. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: You're alone with your sister, she's3 years old at this point. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Andmy m other. My m other has the burden of the children. Shetoldme,f or 

herself  she wouldn'thave bothered,but she couldn't let the childrenbe tortured and killed.So that's 

wh y she would doanything. So shedecided to take this route. 
 
 
As we were travelin g a young m an attachedhim self  to usand started chatting away to her. 
Slowl y, slo wl y pushing her, asking if  there was anybody Jewish in herf amily, because it was enough 

if  your great
-
great grandf ather were Jewish, you were Jewish, that'sit. 
 
 
My m other toldm e that, unfortunately, she couldn't take the pressure anym ore, and she 
actually adm itted to him  that we were actually Je wish. At thispointhe said,W ell, I'm  going to Jaroslav 

as well. I'm  going to take you, I'm  going to look af ter you until then.T hen in Jaroslav I ha
ve to hand 

you over to the gestapo. My mother said yes, sheunderstood.T hat's all she coulddo, couldn't do 

anything. 
 
 
He was ver y caref ul to watch, becausehe thought maybe I would run or something. Always 
hadone of us inhis sights, but there was nowhere to run. I certainly wouldn't have run. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: This m an, who was this again? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  He was fokes Deutch. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Thatm eans ethnicGerman. They were considered Germanminority. Now that the 

Nazis were in charge, the ethnicGermans were now in charge. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right. They hadbetter conditions, a little better rationsand they whether given 

pointsfor bringing Jews in. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: They spoke Germ an, probably Polish as well. 
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Ye
ah. 
 

 
 
7
 
>> Vincent Slatt: They could go in between and know who was who m . 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. As we were traveli ng, knowing what's going to happen to us,m y m other is 
still thinking, m y m other never gi ves up, andf inally she com esup with one idea.She
 
said, Look, I'm  
going to gi ve you everything I have, even those coats on our backs, I particularly rem ember the coat 

she prom ised him . She said, I want toask you onef avor:W hen we get to the gestapo,I want you to 

have us shot im mediately, all three of us. She was so concernedaboutus being taken away, 

suff ering there and torn apart, shefelt that was about the only thing she coulddo isto have us shot 

qu ickl y, n o t to  suffe r. 
 
 
So that'show we trave led to Jaroslav, all therest of the way, knowing that when we get to 
Jaroslav he's going to take us over to the gestapotobe shot. I don'teven believe they woul d have 

done it, because
 
--
 
but that's how we were traveling. 
 
 
So afterfour days and four nights,exhausted, kind of half  conscious, we arrived in Jaroslav 
and we start getting off thetrain and suddenly I wake upand I said,W aita minute. Idon'twant to die. 

I was terrif ied. I said that, pulling atm y m other, Mom ,
 
I don't want todie. 
 
 
My poor m other turned to him and said,Look, wh y don't you let hergo? Maybe she'sblonde, 
green
-
eyed, maybe she can survive. I said, No, Idon't want to goby m yself . I wouldn't gowithout 
you. No, no, no,no,I'm  not going. 
 
 
A s w
e keep walking, she said to him, Look,do you have children?And he said, Yes, Ihave 
children. 
 
 
She said,Look, keepwhatever I gave you.
 
But why do you want us on your conscience?Letus go. Keep everyt hing I gave you. 
 

 
Something touched him , and he le
t us go. He just left us in them iddle of the street. He said, 
You don't have a chance. But he lef t us.So very strange town, on the littlemain road. My m other 

started looking around. W eneeded to be somewhere. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Your m other was good with challenges, wasn't she? Swim m ing champion, athlete. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt:W hat did your mother do, now that she had thetwo of  you, no clothes,no job, didn't 

know the town of  Jaroslav. How did shef igure outhow to help you surv
i ve? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, she saw a little caf e.W e walked intothe cafe. She askedf ora littlem ilkf or 

m y sister. Then she started asking the people there if  there was anybody who knew of som ewhere 

she could be lodged, som ewhere who took lodgers. 
 

 
Onem an got up and said, Yes, I do know som ebody.T here's a washer wom annot toof ar f rom 
here. I'll take youto her. Shetakes lodgers. You see, it was very im portant we shouldbe inside, 

because theGermanswere roam ing with theguns out. It was very d angerous to be on theoutside. 

Plus, we never knew, to thisday I don't know, if the papers we got were real.I don't know if they 

couldhave really checked them  out.W edidn't know. 
 

 
She wanted to avoid having her papersaskedf or. 
 
>> V in ce n t S la tt:W h
en Halinatalks about papers, what you had tohave at that time period,for 
children, Halina's age or Eva's age, abaptism  certif icate would count asan ID of  sorts, butf or a 

wom an of Halina'sm other's age you had to have also a worker's card which would have a 

photograph ID, signature on it, say who you are, who you worked for. Getting one of those is really 

im portant,f or anyone.You had tohave the Baptistm al certif icatesfor the kids as well,f or the papers. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. Thism an took us
 
over to this lady, and it was a little lady, very sweet. She 
saw m y m otherand the two kids. Im ean, wem usthave looked completely worn out. She said she 

would take us. But her son, shehadf our strapping sons,and one was there, he said, No,no, no, no,
 
don'ttake her. She said, No.This is am other and two children.I have to take her. 
 

 
 
8
 
 
I thought this was the m ost wonderf ul Christian lady thatever exist ed. Shetook us in. My 
m other said to her,I have nom oney, buttomorrow I'll go to work, and I will, whatever I earn I will 
bring to youf or keeping us. 
 

 
So what we gotf rom her was a bed, and that's all we needed.I slept at thefeet. My m other 
and sister slept there.My m other went to wor k thenext day,f ound som e housekeeping job. She 

changed the jo
bafew tim es.She was ver y worried about security, because she was worr ied about 

m y sister being sick. She was ver y sickl y. Plus, shehad very curl y h air. You a you that on the picture. 

T he Polish girls have straight blondehair. Mine were blonde and wavy
 
so they could do braids. W ith 
her, she was like anafro. Som ebody on the street would pointather. It was enough. Every little thing 

was dangerous. Shehad hers shavedoff  com pletely. She claim edit was to make her hair thicker. 
 
[Laughter]
 
W ell ,  s he  ha d
 
an excuse, see. 
 
 
In them eantim e, we were with this lady and she was ver y careful togroom me particularly. I 
think shefelt m y sisterwas too young, m y m other was tooold.I don't know what she thought about 

who we were, but shewas ver y keen onm aking m ea good Catholic. So she sentme to classesf or 

comm unionand, of course, we went to church every Sunday. It isaver y beautif ul religion.I always 

say it wasn't m ine,butit is a beautif ul religion. I liked going to church on Sundays. They had the 

incen
se and the priests were ver y nice. Also, we had school.Kids had school, with I was very helpful 

to  m e . 
 

 
I didn't mention that my father had taughtm e to read bef ore the war, because he wantedm e 
he to go to kindergarten knowing how to read thenewspaper.
 
Sohe was able to teach me that. So 
this was helpf ul when I went to this two
-
hourschool that the Polishkids had. Because one hour was 
for religion, and one wasf or general, other stuff .Knowing, learning from  the catechism ,that's the way 

they taught th
e Catholic religion, with the catechism  questionsand answers. I picked itup very 

qu ickl y.   

 
T hat helpedm e, because, asI said, didn't know m uch about the church atall. And Ihad to go 
to, obviously, confession eventually, which was really scary f or me,
 
because I had absolutely nobody 
to ask. But If igured it out. Youdo what youhave to. 
 
 
I went to the communion. I have a picture, you saw I thinka pictureof  that. My mother, in the 
m eantim e,always look ing form ore security, she was worried all the tim e that som ebody wil l  point at 

us, we gi ve ourselves away som ehow. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Can you tell us what shemeant when she saidalwa ys to hide in plain sight? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. In a second. 
 
[Laughter]
 
No, because justbefore that, just bef ore 
that, she wanted
 
--
 
she thought if  we go to Germ any f or 
work, the Poles were allowed to offer them selves f or work in Germ any. T he Germans always needed 

people to work. So she thought that would besaf er, because thePolish people were very goodsat 

recogni
zing Je ws. She was alwa ys afraid som ebody will som ehow f igure out that we were  Jewish. So 
that's why she offeredherself  to go to Germ any f or work. Butthat didn't work, becausem y sister was 

too young and they wouldn't takeher.Soobviously, we didn't go
. 
 
 
T hen, so thenext thing she came up with was  this hiding in plain sight. Shedecided to apply 
for work with the German military cam p, just outsidethe town, because she wantedthis outside. She 

wanted an ID, if  she was stopped inthe street, she can say, I work for you. Very im portant. The 

Germ ans were ver y keen on everybody work i ng for them . I'm talking about thePoles, not the Jews. 
 
 
So when she applied, they told her they had to check the papers.Again, we were in a terrifying 
statefor weeks, because we waited for them to check the papers. I don't know whether they did or 

 
 
9
 
not.Af ter afew weeks, she gotthe job. The job was to peel potatoes in the kitchenof  themilitary 
cam p. But she hadthe ID. And thathelped,because one of the sons of  thehoste
ss,  she  use d  to  kill 

pigs f ora living. T he Germ ans didn't allow that. So it was a death sentence,and they were alwa ys 

lookingf or him .T hey never f ound him, but they were looking for him. 
 

 
Onenight, they cam estorm ing in, Rous, rous! Everybody out. My m other cam e out, with the 
Ausweiss. He said, No, you stay. Theonly Jews in the house, we stayed. 
 
[Laughter]
 
T he restof  thepeople that were there were taken into the station tobe checked out.T hey all worked, 

so there was noproblem .T hey returned the next m orning. Forus itwas not being checked out.T his 

was m y m other's greatest fear, som ething would happen. 
 
 
During that tim e, during the occupation, we had one letterf rom ourfriends we lef t behind.T hey 
felt it was too im portant not to write, becausethat was also dangerous. T hey sent usa letter telling us 

thatm yf ather had sent a letter through the Red Cross, thathe was saf e with m y sister in Palestine. 

Now, we knew that we had a part off am ily in Palestine. It was all British mandate atthe time
.  W e 

didn't know even whic h town, but to us it meanthe was safe out ofRussia, which was ver y im portant 

to us.W e couldn't contact him  oranything, but this was goodnews that we had in case weever 

survi ved.W e thoughtwe'd be able to maybe f indhim and to get usout. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Thatgood news got to you in Jaroslav? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. Yes, yes. In the meantime, we triedour best. Food was ver y scarce even 

for the Poles. A lot of tim es we were hungry and kids would goand try to grab som e 
food when the 
farm ers wouldbring acontingent off ood, you know, horse
-
drawn cart with f ood.Potatoes,carrots 
f rom  thefarm s.T hey had to be weighed in. Ifthey were weighed in, they didn't care, and we could 

grab af ew things, juststeal it.So the kids
 
did a lotof  that, if  they could. If they weren't wei ghed in, 
they were not very helpf ul. 
 
 
T hem ainfood, I think,was barley, which, well , I didn't likeeven before the war. 
 
[Laughter]
 
T hat was one of the things thatI never touched. But anyway, we were hungry at tim es,but not as bad 

as som e.So can't complain.W e just didn't know what was going on in the world, so we didn't have 

newspapers, we didn't have radios,nobody knew what was going on in thef ront.So we just existed, 

day in and day out. 
 
 
T he
none morning, when we woke up,therewas com plete silence.T hat is a sortof deathly 
silence, you know, wh en you know the horse and carts going backandforth, back andforth. All of a 

sudden, it was like nothing.W edidn't know what was happening.W e thought maybe they'd lef t, but 

nobody knew. My m other was in bed with m y sister, and I was standing by the bed. She was 

wondering if  she should go to work or not. Becauseagain, as I said,we just couldn'tf igureout what 

was going on. Suddenly, there was trem endous bang, and it was abomb that split over that little 

house. I got hit in the hand. I started crying out tom y m other. My m other got up, grabbedme, and we 

walked into the street. T here was nothing, nobody in the street.Som y m other just, we had to walk to 

thehospital, which was abouta block and ahalf . 
 
 
T hey told her that the Russians were come som ething, thatthe Germ ans hopefully had gone. 
T hey toldm y m other that unfortunately they might have to takem y handoff , because of allthedirt, 

becau
se there was nopenicillin in those days. But I had wonderf ul nurses.T hey were nuns, beautiful 

nuns. They had thesewonderful white hats and black
 
--
 
yeah, very, ver y lo vely. Very lovel y. They 
were reall y wonderf ul nurses. 
 

 
 
10
 
 
T hey saved m y hand.T hey used to caught rise it, it was very
 
--
 
to cauterize. It was very 
painful. It saved m y hand. My m other was absolutely devastated. My sister was sickl y. She was 
drainedf or everything. I was the strong one.There I was, inthe hospital, wounded. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: How long were you in the hospitalfor then? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: Two m onths. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: T wo m onths? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. Inthe meantim e,m y m other slept with m eand m y sister thef irst night, 

then she went backtosee what happenedback there.T he place, we were kind of in themiddle of 

thathouse,and it was com pletely destroyed.T hey discovered that the lady who had usdied in the 

kitchen.W e did not know. The roof fell on her. 
 

 
T he neighbor took us in, apparently. There was nothing to
 
salvage. W ehad nothing anyway. 
She just went with m y sister to theneighbor.In the meantime, inthehospital I was saying to m y 

m other,W ell,now I can say my nam e, right? 
 
 
No, she says, you can't, because there was a pogrom of af ew Jews  that cameout
 
of  h i d i ng.  
T he Poles killed them . 
 
 
I always underline thatnotall the Poles were bad, but this was m y experience. I couldnotstill 
say I was Jewish because of what happened. 
 

 
T he lady who had us, the neighbor, toldm y mother that the only thing she's sorry about isthat 
Hitler didn'tf inish his job. I was very angr y, becauseI hadall this time I hadtopretend.I thought 

f inally I can say who I was, and I couldn't. 
 
 
Now, m y sister did not know she was Jewish, so she was com pletely unaware. My m other 
said, You just have to keep this secret f or a while. 
 
 
She started knitting again, to earn a little bitof money toputannouncem entsfor m yf ather.W e 
knew the Russians were com ing. Eventually, they came. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: So the Russians cam eand liberated Jaroslav. Right? T hey liberated. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Quote unquote. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Liberatedf rom  Nazi, now Soviet occupation.T hen what did yourf am ily do? 
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  My m other told m ethey're not leaving. She knew. T hen sheput an 
announcement to lookfor m yf ather. Andhewas f ound, luckily, anothermiracle. Andhe sentm y 

cousinf rom Palestine. T his was his sister's son. He came and to getus out. When he arrived my 

sister looked at him and said, You're aniceman,but you're Jewish. 
 

[Laughter]
 
I don't know how she knew. T his is thePolisheducation. Idon't know how she knew. But he toldher, 

W ell, you are too, but she did not quitebelieve it. Shedidn't want tobelieve it. She toldm elater there 

were also people asking her, saying to her,obviousl y people were thinking and wondering who we 

were, because they we re asking her, Now you can tell us, right, you're Jewish? She said, No. I said, 

Look a
tm e. Do Ihavehorns? Do Ihave a tail? 
 
[Laughter]
 
It was diff icult. She wasn't too happy. Eventually, we got it right. 
 

[Laughter]
 
My m other, inthe meantim e, was diagnosedwith breast cancer. She had to have an operation. That 

were the two things we had todo. How to putit?T hedoctor said she needs to have it, we don't know 

for sure,but we don't want you to be orphaned. Shehad to have that operation. 
 
 
Bef ore we left Poland, m y cousin putus in touch with the Jewish agency in Krakow.W ehad to 
m ove 
closer to Krakow. There was again, when we needed lodging, we had to pretend we were 
Catholic.T hey wouldn't take Jews.W ehad sort of a comm unal housef rom  which they used totake 

 
 
11
 
people, to throw them over thef rontier into Germ any.W hat we were  supposed
 
to do,f rom  there we 
walk to the station, gettickets and go to Berlin. That way we were able to f inally get together with m y 
fa the r. 
 
 
Eventually we f oundout thatm y father, the way he got out of Russia was because Stalin and 
Churchill and Roosevelt had
 
am eeting, and they decided they needed boots on the ground, sothey 
were going to starting with letting out som e political prisoners.There was a generalalso,a political 

prisoner called General Anders, and he was asked to create a unit to go outand join theBritish Arm y. 
 
 
He was a ver y, ver y ni ce man,because they wanted him  only to take the men, and he refused. 
He said, I'm  taking the m en and the fam ilies. 
 

 
So m y f ather
 
--
 
m y aunt was there as well. And m y cousin andm y uncle. Oneof  the
 
--
 
not this
 
aunt, but another aunt. So he tookeverybody out,and m yf ather was part of this Polishunitwhich 

was ser ving with the British Arm y in Egypt. So he had to write f orus to go to England. 
 
 
W e were in the DP cam p in Italyf or a month, then shipped off to England.T hen we started 
learning a new language, new culture,new ever ything. M y m other was particularly worr ied about m y 

education, because Im issed som any years. There was not muchhelp there. I was just put intoa 

school,toldto geton with it, so to 
speak. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: By that time you were 13 years old when the war ended, right? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah, yeah. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: 7 to 13. 
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes, that's right. Yeah, Itookup table tennis, because that was available. 
T ennis was not.T herewere nof acilities. I played a lotof  tabletennis, which gave m e anice entry. I 

didn'thave to worry about m y English. You know, a lot of
 
f riends that wa y.W e traveleda lot.W ehad 
local team s in London. It was ver y nice to bepart of that. 
 
 
T hat, in the end, whenIsrael was created, they started having what I called the Jewish 
Olym pics, the Maccabiah games. I don't know if  you're fam iliar with that. But all the youth,Jewish 

youthf rom  all over theworld come therefor the Maccabiah gam esever y f our years, just like the 

Olym pics. I was lucky to be sent with a couple of  youngf ellows to Israel.T hat was m yf irst trip to 

I s ra e l.  My f am ily t
here, it was wonderf ul. I would have to likedto say, but m y mother was not very 
well, so I came back.That was 1953. 
 
 
In 1956, m y mother, unfortunately, got
 
--
 
cancer came back again.They had x
-
rays. T hey 
couldn'tf ind it. It was too late.W e lost her in1956.T hen in 1957 was thenext Maccabiah.So this 

tim e I saidI'm  going to stay here,and it turned out to be many years. I broughtm y sister over, and I 

stayed 11 years, and I happened to geta job inT el Aviv with the American em bassy. T hat's how I 

me
t m y husband.W ehada littleboy, and he wanted very m uch tocom ef ora little bit to the United 
S ta te s. 
 
 
So we appliedfor a visa.W e cam e here on the last quotas.That was in 1968. My son was like 
5  
1/2, 6. He went tof irst grade and so we just settled
 
in and just decided not to go back. It was just 
toom uch to travel again and again. So we've been here since 1968,andthen eventually we  were in 

Palo Alto, then we came to this area,and af ter I retired I was looking for som ething todo, and wanted 

t o  vo
lunteer. Idecidedaf ter looking around that this was the place where Ibelonged,and Iowed it to 
the6 m illion andm y mother particularly for whathappenedtous. So I am very gratef ul to the 

m useum , doing a wonderful job here, keeping our m em oriesand sharing them  with everyb ody. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Halina, bef oreI give you the opportunity toend with a f inal statem ent, you said you 

like when you have questionsf rom the audience, whenpeoplehave questionsf or you. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely. 
 

 
 
12
 
>> V
incent Slatt:W e rushed you a little bit today so you've got tim efor questionsf rom  theaudience. 
I've got two f riends here f rom  Visitor Services oneither side.T hey have microphones. If anyone hasa 
questionfor Halinatoday, about anything she talked about or abouther experiences, please letm e 

know. T hey can com eto you with them icrophone. Please speak clearly into it so that everyone can 

hear the question. OK?
 

>>W hen yourm otherwas working f or the mayor and Jewish people were notallowed togo to
 

school, where were you and your sister?W hat were you guys doing? 
 

>> Vincent Slatt:W hen your m other was wor king at the mayor's house, knitting the clothes, right? 
 

>> Halina Peabody:  She was knitting athome. She would go there. No, that time she was 
wo rkin g a s 
a Jewish person. She just would go.T hey wo uld tellher what they needed.She would come hom e 

and knit.T hen she would take itback to him . 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: OK. Over here. 
 
>>W here is Eva now? 
 

>> Vincent Slatt:W here is your sister Eva now
? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My sister is in London. That's why I travel so much. Shehasthree kids,f our 

grandkids. My trek is you've beenW ashington toTel Aviv and London andback. Unf ortunately, we're 

a littlefar away. But we have the internet and thephone, so we keep in touch. I was very h appy tobe 

able to takem y kids over there, sothe cousins know eachother. 
 
>> V in ce n t S la tt: OK . 
 
>>W hen youf inally reached Londonand you were 13, did you have thefear ofmaybehaving the 

sam e as when you were under the Russiansor under the Germ ans? Did youf ear having to hide 

again or were you feeling relieved, this is it, I'm f ree? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W as I afraid in England?
 
>> Ye s .  
 

>> Halina Peabody:  No. No. I have insidem e I'm af raidof  policemen. Yeah, because anybody in 

authority. So I was
 
--
 
but it wasn't real. Therewas no needfor it.T hey were ver y nice. T heEnglish 
were very worn outsf rom  the war, as you know. Ever ything was in rubble.They really wer e very kind 

to take us in andto share with us e
verything they had.W e had the sam e rations.W e had the same 

opportunities. I could go to school imm ediately. In fact,I had to go to school. They wouldn'tlet me not 

go to school. 
 
 
T o this day, m y husband usedto laugh atme because if I saw a police car
 
behind with the 
lights on, I'm  always thinking I did something.He would just laugh, because that's just inside me, that 

com puter in m y head. 
 
 
But no,theEnglish were extrem ely nice.T hey were not very nice to m e, because when I 
m ispronounced the langua
ge they looked atm e ratheraskance. I tried not to do that, but it's a very 

diff icult language to learnf rom Polish. I didn'tknow any other language except Polish. From Polish to 

English is a long way. The sentencesare differentand so I had a hard time
 
there. In fact, when I 
started working, I was a better speller than the British people. 
 
[Laughter]
 
So I learned to write and I learned it in school. My English is f rom school, notf rom  the street, you 

know, as you go as little children. I really learnedthe proper English. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt:W onderful.A question back here? 
 
>> thank you.T hanksfor your presentation. Could you talk a little bitabout the variousm otivations 

that youobserved in people that revealed your others' Jewishness to the Germ ans
 
or to the Poles? 
W hydid they do it?W hat were the various reasonsthey hadf or revealing Jews? 
 

 
 
13
 
>> Vincent Slatt: He's interested in knowing wh y som e of the people collaborated anddidn't like 
Jewish people. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  OK.W ell, various reasons.T hey revealedm any becausethey were also under 

law there that they had to, if they knew you were Jewish. They knew they were going to bekilled if 

they helped a Jew. Especially in Poland, they were ver y, ver y strict. T hey would kill the wholef am ily. 

S
o that was true. However, som e people in spite of thathelped theJews. 
 
 
Mostly, the Jews were not
 
--
 
they hada badfeeling towards the Jews even before the war.I 
have anuncle, whom we just discovered. He's buried in the Christian cem etery, because he was a 

prof essorat theuniversity in Krakow, but hecouldnotbea teacherif he was Jewish. Thatwas before 

the war. Sothey had a great deal of  restrictionsf or the Jews bef ore. There were num erous klauses, 

m eaning a certainnumber of  Jews were allo wed. My father couldn'tgo to school either, if he wished, 

for the dentistry. So that was alwa ys there. 
 
 
Somehow, the peoplewere just brainwashed. Also, thepriests, theCatholic priests were not 
helpful, because the priests were told by theGerm ans, you know, If you gi ve us all the Jews, just help 

us, it will be betterfor you. So that was an occupation thing. People just gave in tothat.T here were 

people who really sacrificed them selves, but there were people whoweren't. I don't blame those 

people, butI blam e the people who really
 
--
 
there is an exhibit down here. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: That's what I was about to say. Halina spoke about thediff erentpeople who both 

gave assistance to her fam ily and triedtof inancially benef itor denounceherfam ily as well .
 
That's the 
bulk of the questions that getasked in our exhibit right out here called "Som e were neighbors"  about 

collaborationand complicit during the Holocaust, about how peopleat the local level, sm all towns like 

Jaroslav, T ouste or Zaleszc zyki, what they did, how they got involved to helpor hinder som eone 

s u r vi vi n g . 
 
 
Very good questions.T hat's what theexhibit outhere will go into. 
 
 
Is there another question here?Backthere,m aybe? Yeah?
 
>> T hroughout the years, you were m eant tokeep your identity concealed because you were Jewish. 

How did it feel tof inally come out andbe yourself again? 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Throughout the years you were supposed to conceal your Jewish identity. How did 

it feel when you could finally say you were Jewish again? 
 

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, itfelt good, relief , particularly after I went to Israel I got restored. My soul 

was restored, because I could see what we have and what we've done with the little pieceof  land 

there. You know, after being put down all these years, runningfor m y life, it was wonderf ul. I think 

Israel f or m e is m y salvation, yeah. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: Great question. Right downhere. 
 
>> First I'd like to thank you for being here.W e're,I'm  sure I can speakfor this whole room , we're 

ve r y 
thankf ul that you're here. Your dad, washe able
 
--
 
h e r e
-
joinedyour f am ily in England? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. 
 
>>W as he able to then resum ehis career as a dentist? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's your question?
 
>> Ye s .  
 

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, when he
 
came back, he worked as a dentist in the Arm y.W hen he was 
de
-
mobed. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Demobilized. 
 

>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. T he British call itde
-
m obed. Dem obilized. He didn't have enough little 
letters after hisnam e, so he had som e years thathe could not practice. But afterm y m other died, 

they, the British needed more dentists, and they had som e special exam s that were m orepractical 

 
 
14
 
than theoretical. My f ather passedthat andbecam e afull
-
f ledgeddentist. Yes. He joined us and we 
were together. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Right here?
 
>> Have you ever been back toPoland? 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: Have you ever been back to Poland? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. I didn'tmean to, but
 
--
  
[Laughter]
 
I didnot. Because, you know, m y m other never went back to the town of  Zaleszczyk i becauseall our 
fam ily was in Krakow. So we never went back there. So I didn't really have anywhere to go. I was too 

young. I didn't remember toomuchof  that, of the tim ethere. Butm y sister called m eatone point. I 

was in Verm ont skiing, and I got this callf rom London, you know, Please come with m e, because 

there's going tobe50th anniversary of  the ghettouprising. If  youdon't go, I won't know anything. I 

don't remember anything. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: 1993. 
 

>> Halina Peabody:  So I said, obviously, yes. That was m y f irst trip. The second trip I went with m y 

husband, that was to see Zaleszczyki, to seeif our house was standing.We wentthroughPoland, it's 

now Ukraine.W e had to go there.W ediscovered the house was notstanding. It was destroyed. So 

there was nothing there. It was sad because the town is not what itwas before the war. 
 

 
T hey gave m e a littledisk of  what it usedto look like, butnow it was kind of not
hing there. The 
little synagogue which was boarded up, and there were stonesf rom the cemetery, which were used 

for walks. It was notmuch. 
 
 
T here was one lady, however, they f ound that remembered m y mother, teachingm e skiing. 
T hat was very touching. T hat was m y second trip. 
 
 
My third trip was because I discovered som e peoplef rom  Zaleszczyki through them useum , 
who knew m e. As I said, I don't remem ber them . But we hadthis weird reunion of people.I got to 

know them then.They were collecting m oney for am onum ent to puton theunmarked grave of the 

600people that were killed in thef irst action. 
 
 
So again, I went.This tim e m y son cam e, and m y sister came,and herf our children came.So 
that was another trip. 
 
 
T hen the last trip was to Krakow, because
 
they discovered m y m other's various deeds that she 
did the swim m ing, andthey had an exhibit of Jewish athletes in Krakow. So of  course, I went again. 

E ve r y tim e  I go ,I sa y it's m y la st trip , but

>> Vincent Slatt:W hat m ust have been very m eaningf ul, they had a big exhibit at the historical 

exhibit of  Krakow, about Jewish athletesf rom Krakow. Her m other was a three
-
tim e national m edal 
winner. She was in the exhibit. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes, yes.T hose were my trips to Poland. My friendherefoundm y uncle's grave, 

so now I've got another thing that Im ight have to go. 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Vincent Slatt:W e'll see.Are thereany other questions? Right in themiddle maybe.W e'll have this 

be our last question.

>> Halina Peabody:  OK. No, m y sister understood that she was Jewish, and she
 
--
 
we're not 
religious, so it wasn't a ver y big thing f or her.Shedidn't rememberm uch about the Catholic religion 
either. 
 
 
Asf ar as I'm concerned, Ihave always beenJewish, and continue to be Jewish. My m other 
explained it tom e very nicely. She said to me that we all pray to thesame God, but through diff erent 

religions. Andof  course, we're Jewish. I never hadany conf licton that score. So that was easy. 
 

>> Vincent Slatt: OK. Well, I wantto thank you, Halina,for all these questionsand speaking with us 

today. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: Thank yo
u. 
 
>> Vincent Slatt: It'salways our custom  with 
F i rs t  P e rson
 
to let ourfirst person have the last word. 
I'm  going tohand itover to Halina to closeout the program .T hen afterward, our photographer here is 

going to come up to take a group shot of Halina with all of  you in the background. OK? Halina? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, all I can say is that,f irstof  all,I'm  very grateful tothe museum for being 

here,for doing the work they're doing. I think it's ver y im portant to let people know what can happ
e n  if  

we're not vigilant, and that if  we arenot worki ng togetherfor the better world f or our children and 

grandchildren.
