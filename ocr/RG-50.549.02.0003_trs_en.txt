Interview with Ernest Koenig 
June 12, 1997 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Answer: -- is Ernest Koenig and we ar
e in my apartment in Watergate at 
Landmark in Alexandria, Vi
rginia, and today is the 12
th
 of June, 1997. 
Question: Like to go back
 and ask you several questions about your fami ly. 
A: Yes. 
Q: If you could give -- give a little bac
kground about -- about your family, your -- 
your immediate family -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- their names, and -- and oc
cupations of your parents. 
A: Yes, yes. My family lived in a little 
town in southern Mo
ravia, not far from 
Vienna, about 80 kilometers north of Vie
nna. I could trace my family back to the 
17
th
 and perhaps to the 16
th
 century, and they probably
 lived there all the time. 
Perhaps they lived in Vienna
, were expelled from there, and then they came back. 
And it is not impossible, but that™s just 
a guess, that my  parents and the Jews in 
this area were there in the Roman times
, because the Roman -- the limit of the 
Roman empire was in Vienna, called vie -- 
viento bona. My father was a glazier, 
but he had a hardware shop and he was 
affluent. My mother and her family came 

from the little town where I 
was raised, but they were very Viennese. And the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
3
whole population there was oriented towa
rd s Vienna. Vienna was the great city 
from which all the good things, and perhaps 
e-even bad th ings, 
emanated. In 1918, 
this part of Moravia was annexed by th
e Czechs. The Czech Republic was founded 
in 1918, but my family, as
 well as the neighbors and 
most of the po -- of the 
population experienced a very strong a
ffinity to Vienna and to Austria. 
Q: Did you have brothers or sisters? 
A: I had one brother who is still alive, 
who lives in New York City. I had no 
sister s. My family was very
 large and most of the fam
ily was destroyed during the 
Holocaust. The Viennese part and the part 
living in this little town, and the -- only 
two cousins and my  brother surv ived.  

Q: Is your brother older or younger than you? 
A: My brother is 85, I™m 80. 
Q: Was your mo ther a -- a homemaker, managed the home? 

A: Yes, my mother was a homemaker. She 
was a very, very good cook. She was a 
very -- lady always of good spirit. 
She was -- she did many good deeds out -- 
spontaneously. She had poor people, or pe
ople who were -- who were in need, and 
she was a very warm person and also 
her whole attitude was Viennese. For 
instance, she would sing all the time,
 and would sing Viennese songs. 
Q: Was your family religious? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
4
A: Well, in my time, o n ly my grandfathe
r was religious. He went every day to the 
synagogue, but he said it™s nonsense what th
ey are saying there. Yet he insisted to 
go th ere because he said one has to mainta
in the tradition. Not to go there would 
be a kind of betrayal of our ancestors. An d the rest of my family was not religious. 
At the high holiday s they perhap s would 
to the synagogue, but not otherwise. 
Q: What about your family™s politics,
 your father and mother™s politics? 
A: Well, you know, my  father had the gr
eat experience of the first World War. 
And he, like all the grownups who lived in
 my time were against the war, were for 

democracy, were against the Hapsburgs. So no
w, as I read history, it turns out that 
the Hapsburgs were really protectors of 
the Jews. They were not against the Jews. 
They used the Jews and protected them, that
 is to say, at least in the last two 
centuries, as least since Joseph the second,
 who contributed to the emancipation of 
the Jews who lived  betw een 1780 and 
1790. He was emperor of Germany. 
Q: When  Hitler came to power did your 
-- was your discussion 
in -- among your f-
father and mother ab-a
bout wh at was going on? 
A: Well, it was not only when Hitler came
 to power. My parents and the whole 
population was politically very interested, ve
ry interested. And I remember th at as 
a little boy, six years old, I saw the Nazis 
marching with the 
red flag, with the 
swastika in their flag. But these people we
re not considered to
 be our enemies, 
because the personal relations with them
 were very good. 
So they were in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
5
principle against the Jews, but not in practice. And the -- when Hitler won a great 
victory in  the elections of 1830 -- of 19
30, then the Nazi wer -- Nazi problem and 
the Hitler problem became very acute beca
use we knew very we
ll, we understood 
very well that might affect us.  

Q: Were you -- 
A: So let me say, we followed it very, 
very , very closely and although I was a 
young person, I didn™t have 
much experience, I know a lo
t about the in
itial time of 
the Hitler regime because it fascinated us
 and we knew, we realized we have a 
vital interest in it. 
Q: Were you close with your brother? 

A: Yes. We -- we were very close, even t
hough there was an age difference of five 
years. 

Q: You played together, and -- 

A: We played togeth er. Of course, he wa
s the -- the model, the role model whom I 
followed. 
Q: Is he still? 
A: No, but it™s in a diff
erent stage of our life. 
Q: I wanted to jump way ahead -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- to your meeting with Elizab
eth and your f-friendship with -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
6
A: Yes. 
Q: -- with her and the first time you met her. 
A: Yeah. Well, we met in Paris in 1939. We
 were refugees, and we were really at 

the lowest level of society because we 
had no country to prot
ect us. The French 
didn™t like u -- not -- didn™t like us, not
 personally, but they had to o many 
refugees, there was unemployment in France,
 and at this time I met E lizabeth in 
Paris, in the summer o f 1939. She went 
-- she participated in a club of young 
[indecipherable] and I once came there and par
ticipated in this club, too. A kind of 
club, it wasn't a real club. And that™s 
where we met. And that was before the 
outbreak of the war. That was in May 1939 
and the war broke out at the beginning 
of September.  
Q: And did you beco me friends then? 
A: Oh, we became friends from 
the very beginning, right. 
Q: What was it that w as the attraction between the two of you? 

A: Well, that™s very difficult to say. Y
ou know, many great philosophers have th -- 
have thought about the reasons which a
ttract men and wo men. I think it™s very 
difficult to say. But it was also a tragic
 time. We met in May 1939 for the first 
time, the war broke out at the beginning 
of September. I volunteered for the army, 
so we were separated. I came back on le
ave in Decemb er 1939 
and then again in -- 
at Easter time, I think in -- in May -- 
March or Ap ril 1939. And then  the war 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
7
separated us completely, but we met afterthe war by chance, in a little village in 
southern France and were for a short while 
together, but a couple of months later, I 
was interned in a concentration camp in
 France. That was after the defeat of 
France and so we -- we -- we didn™t lo
se contact, because we were in 
correspondence, but in December 1941, E
lizabeth and her family left France for 
America. S o  I didn™t see her from ni
net -- from 1940 until 1947 where we met 
again in England and then we married.  
Q: You also were -- you kn
ew her mother and father. 
A: Oh yes, I knew her fa
mily very well, yes. 
Q: What was your relationship with her father? 

A: Very friendly relationship. Her father
 was a very, very  highly educated and 
highly intelligent person, so 
it was very nice and interesting to talk to him and s -- 
her mo ther was a very nice lady and a very friendly lady. 

Q: And at one point in the video you said
 you couldn™t stay 
with them, you had -- 
you went off -- 
A: I couldn™t stay with them because wh
en I was reunited with
 Elizabeth and with 
her parents, her parents -- her father was not yet demobilized and th ey  had no 
money and nothing to eat. I reme mb er the w
hole family, that is to say, Elizabeth™s 
father, Elizabeth™s mother, Elizabeth and fo
r a couple of days even I ate the ration 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
8
which her father got from th
e military. So one 
meal for four or five people. That 
made it impossible to stay there.  
Q: Well now I want to jump ahead further, past -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- the war, to liberation. And I wanted
 to  ask you what happened -- if you could 
recount what happened immediately fo
llowing liberation, wh ere you went. 
A: Well, my libern -- liberation is a very lo
ng story. I de-decided in  -- to evade and 
not to go along with  the SS on their hung 
-- on their death marches. I was in hiding 
and then the Russian army
 came and I went back -- 
I tried to go back to 
Czechoslo vakia, but there was still war, yo
u couldn™t go back. So  I very los -- sl-
slowly drifted back to  Czechoslo vakia a
nd from there to my former home where 

there was nobody left. And I stayed anothe
r year in Czechoslovakia and that was 
the beginning of communism, but it was not
 the communists in power, but you felt 
it. So in 1946 I got a visa to go to Englan
d wh ere I stayed another year and then  I 
left England for America and came 
into America in 
February 1948. 
Q: When  -- when  -- immediately after you 
were liberated, what did you have in  
your possession? 

A: Noth ing. 
Q: Noth ing at all. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
9
A: I had nothing. As a matter of fact, four
 months -- no, no, that™s not correct, two 
months after my liberation, I got the fi
rst document which established my identity. 
Before -- and I still have it, I had proofs th
at I was deloused, see, because in Polish 
towns they tried to pr
event the spread of lice, all of 
us had lice. So they gave you a 
paper that you have been in a pl
ace where they disinfected you.  
Q: How was your health, then? 

A: My -- I recovered very fast. I h ad the 
very good physically 
constitution, in spite 

of the fact that I was fo -- over four ye
ars in concen tration camp s, and I was over 
four years or even longer 
hungry. And in spite of the 
fact that wa -- I collapsed 
twice due to hunger, I recovered very fast
. Very, very fast. And I -- my liberation 

took place in January 1945, 
and in May, June, I looked
 absolutely normal and I 
felt very well. 

Q: Do you remember your first full me
al after liberation, what that was? 
A: Yes, there I got a little bit sick. We cr
ossed the Czech frontier in February 1945 
coming from Poland and we were received by
 chance, by a Jewish family which 
had been hidden in the mount
ains and had come back. And th ey had -- they came 
back to their own house, there was plenty 
of food and great comfort and they  were 
extremely friendly to  us. And sure, the fi
rst meals made me sick, but that was 
temporary. 

Q: You ate too mu ch . 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
10
A: I don™t know, but it made me sick. 
Q: Had you been thinking when  you were
 in the concentration camp what it was 
you would want to do when  
you -- if and when you were
 freed, or you got your 
freedom? 

A: No, that was impossible, I mean, our ma
in concern was not to be killed. And so 
what we would do afterwards was beyond us.  
Q: So when you were li -- when you got 
your freedom, what were your plan s, 
what were you thinking? 
A: I had no plans, and mo st of those 
who surv ived  had no plans, because the 
impact of the concentration camp  was overwhelming and it was very difficult to 
find your orientation under 
these new circumstances. We 
had no plans. And if I 
had a plan  it was later on my  wish to be
 reunited with Elizab
eth and to go to 
America. S o  if there was any elem
ent of a plan, it was America.  

Q: Did you know th e whereabouts of -- of your parents?  

A: Oh yes, I know it very, very wer -- 
in great detail, for 
the following reason. 
When I came back to Brno, 
to Mo ravia, there was a ma n who had been with  one 
foot in the concentration camp. He had 
converted from Judaism and was Catholic, 
he had a non-Jewish wife. So he was alwa
ys supposed to  be deported but was not 
deported. He was a neighbor of ours and a nice man. And he called me and told 
me the following, th at during the war a 
German soldier came to visit him and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
11
brought a message from my  father which st
ated that my f -- my mother had been -- 
had been massacred together with 30,00
0 Jewish wo men -- women and my  father 
and the husbands and the relatives had to
 look on. And thisGerman soldier was 
behind where my  father and his colleagues 
were. They were -- they formed a kind 
of outer chain, then there came my father
 and the men, then came the SS and then 
came my mother and all the women, who 
perhaps had to -- probably wi -- had to 
dig their own grave. So that 
was one -- and as proof of th
e veracity of this story, 
my father gave to this man, who was a 
very decent man, who happened to be in 
the army , a picture of mine, a photo of wh
en I was about 11 years old. A couple of 
days later I met a young man in [indeciph
erab le]. His name was Spitzer, I still 
remember it. And th -- after he heard my na
me, he told me that he had been  with 
my father in a concentration camp in Lub
lin, and he knew my  father very well and 
he confirmed the story, my  father had to
ld  him the story which I heard from this 
former neighbor of ours. And I said goo
dbye to this young man by the name of 
Spitzer and two days later it occurred to me
, I have to see him again and talk mo re 
with him. I couldn™t find him any mo re. 
Q: And when you were liberated, you -- y
ou knew that your fath
er had -- had been 
killed. 
A: When -- you know, I was liberated unde
r very dramatic circumstances, the SS 
evacuated so me 5,000 of those who were 
with -- had been with me in the camp, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
12
that was Auschwitz number three. And 
th ere were, however, other prisoners who 
had co me into the camp, and many of them were massacred by th e SS after the 
people who were originally 
with -- with -- with me in
 the camp, had been  -- had 
left the camp and were on this -- on thes
e death marches. And the camp was -- th- 
the SS set fire on the camp and it was very 
miraculous that I escaped and surv ived. 
And it wa -- it was from this camp, wh ich happened to  be between th e German 

and the Russian front -- we were in between 
-- that I escaped in
to the Russian side 
and to Po land. 
Q: And had you heard ne
ws about your father? 
A: Oh no. I -- you know, I wasn™t shocke
d wh en I heard the story about my  -- I 
was shocked about the way my  mother died
, but it was self understood fo r me that 
my whole family is dead. That was -- 

Q: You had a feeling. 

A: Oh, a feeling, a-a-absolutely sure. 

Q: And -- and when  was it confirmed, when y -- 
A: Well, it was confirmed when I talked to
 these men in -- it was perhaps in June, 
July 1945. 
Q: And he also told you about not
 only your mo ther but your father? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
13
A: About my mother, my fath
er, that™s right, yes. Well, 
fo -- he didn't know about 
my father. He knew only a
bou-about my father had -- th
-the message of my father 
and di -- the death of my  father was 
confirmed by this young man, Spitzer. 
Q: And what about your brother? 
A: My brother was in England. 
Q: And did you know that? 

A: Oh yes. When  I was deported from Fr
ance, I managed to send him a postcard 
saying I am returning home, I don™t like it. 
He understood. I couldn™t say exactly 
what happened. And it is -- it was prob
ably a French polic
eman who mailed -- 
who mailed this card, because I couldn™t mail it. 
Q: Was he in -- in Britain 
for the duration of the war? 
A: He was in Britain for the duration of th
e war, he came shur -- to Britain shortly 
before the outbreak of the war and he
 came to the United States in 1948. 
Q: You -- how lo ng were you in the town 
of -- and I don™t know
 how to pronounce 
it, Chessikakowa? 
A: Cz


stochowa, Cz


stochowa. Two days, three days. The Ru ssians had 
confiscated -- the Russians had occupied th
is town  and had confiscated a very big 
build ing of on -- an old building. I wonder 
what it served for before. And in this 
building to establish the repatriation o
ffice. And there were -- there were many 
with us, many French prison -- former pris
oners of war, French 
prisoners of war, a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
14
few British prisoners of war. Probably 
also, but I am not sure, a very few 
American pilots who had been sh ot down
. And then -- well, all kinds of people 
who -- who escaped the Germans. And the Ru
ssians tried to help  us but they  were 
very clumsy and very  badly organized.
 So after two or three days I left 
Cz


stochowa. Cz


stochowa is a very famous town
 in  Po land because one of the 
Catholic saints comes from Cz


st ochowa. 
Q: When  you left there, were you w
ith anyone, or were you by yourself? 
A: When I left there I was with somebody 
and we walk ed, we decided to walk  to 
another -- to hike -- I [indecipherable] 
to say walk -- to another Polish town 
Katowice. And we wanted to
 hike, but there were -- ex
cept for Russian military 
wagons, there was nobody on the ro -- on 
the road who would take you along, who 
could take you along. So we walked. It wa
s very cold, snow was very high and we 
walked to  Katowice. 
Q: And why were you going th ere? 

A: Because I had the i -- I knew the easter
n part of Czechoslovakia, he -- has -- 
has been liberated, so I had the foolish id
ea to go east, e ast, ea st, an d cross the 
high mountains in -- in wint
er and go to this liberated 
part of Czechoslovakia.  
Q: And how long did it 
take you to get there? 

A: Well, I can tell you exactly
. I left the camp  on the 26
th
 of January, 1945, and we 
crossed the Czech frontier on the 14
th
 of February, it was rather fast, relatively 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
15
fast. But generally we were walking -- 
perh ap s no -- not always. Sometimes we 
got a -- a -- somebody took us along. 
But somebody was always the Russian 
soldiers because there was no 
other vehicle on the road.  
Q: What -- you had mentioned, I belie
ve, in your video that in postwar 
Czechoslo vakia there were -- arbitrary things were happening. 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: What was that? 

A: Well, the Czechs were very badly tr
eated and very badl
y oppressed by the 
Germans, and by the Nazis.
 And when  the war ended, 
they decided to expel all 
German inhabitants of Czechoslovakia. No w 
that was certainly arbitrary and cruel, 
because not all German s were Nazis. And 
so the Germans suffered like the Jews. 
Not quite like the Jews, but 
similar to the Jews, becaus
e this deportation of the 
Germans were under much better conditi
on than the deportation of the Jews. 
Created not only hard ship, many people died
. But the difference was that when the 
Jews were dep -- deported, they knew it™s -- 
it™s a death march, th -- it™s -- it™s the 
end of life, whereas the German
s didn™t have to fear that
 they would be bad -- th at 
they would be killed when 
they got -- they were depor
ted to Germany. And the 
Czechs were very chauvinistic. 
Q: Was there much anti-Semitis
m in postwar Czechoslovakia? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
16
A: No. You know, the -- the czechos 
-- Czechoslovakia, the Czech -- 
Czechoslo vak Republic was very demo
cratic. Was founded in 1918 and 
[indecipherable] 1938 and there was no an
tisemit -- no anti-Semitism. One of the 
few countries where there was no anti-Semiti
sm. It has a very humane and liberal 
government, there was no anti-Semitism. A
nd the Czech government also behaved 
very tolerantly towards the refugees w ho came from Germany. After the war, they 
come -- as long as it was 
there the communists were very powerful, it was still a 
demo cratic regime, but they started to pr
ev ail. And I s -- as long as I was there I 
didn™t -- I didn't notice. There was no an
ti-Semitism, but I do know that under the 
communist regime, shortly thereafter, when
 they came to power, there started to 
be anti-Semitism. And certainly it beca
me stronger and stronger and in 1951, 
Czech communists who were Jewish were 
punished, and one or two were hanged. 
And they were selected b
ecause they were Jewish. Th
ey were Czech communist 
Jews. 

Q: How long did you remain in Czechoslovakia? 
A: I remain ed in Czechoslovakia one year. 
From ™45 to ™
46 and then I got the visa 
for England. 
Q: And y -- and durin g that time you 
were studying, you 
went to school? 
A: Yes. You asked me before what my plans were. I really 
didn™t know what I 
should do, but I went to school, I we
nt to the university. Not -- not very 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
17
enthusiastic, not very  devoted to  studying, 
but I went to the univ
ersity. But I really 
don™t -- didn™t know what to do. You kn
ow, it was an entirely new situation and 
not only for me, for all those who came b
ack and who were more or less in the 
same circumstances. Not onl
y were our families dest
ro yed, everything had 
changed. So  you couldn't find your
 beer -- bearings very easily. 
Q: Yes, you said you were disoriented, that -- 

A: Yes. And you know, if you read , youknow, about the book, ﬁAll Quiet on th e 

Western Frontﬂ by a German writer, Remar
que, who describes the first World War 
in the west. He wrote a second book which 
is called ﬁThe Way Back .ﬂ And in th is 
book he describes the diso
rientation of former soldie
rs, German soldiers, they 
don™t find their way in the German post
war society. An d in a certain sense you 
find the same thing with the 
American Vietnam veterans. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And still they don™t find their way. 

Q: W-Wh en  did you begin finding your 
way? When did you begin becoming 
oriented?  

A: Well, I think only in  America and only 
after I had finished my studies. When I 
gr -- I would say when I got my first jo
 -- not my first job, no, no, I had many 
temporary jobs, but when I got my governme
nt job. That was settling back  on that 
-- into normal circumstances. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
18
Q: Did you ever think that you wo
uld live a normal life after that? 
A: Oh yes, why not? But y
ou know, you didn™t see it. 
Q: Can you talk about your
 reunion with Elizabeth? 
A: Well, Elizabeth worked at a job in 
New York City in th e New York Public 
Library an d -- and not necessarily she, but
 her father scratched together enough 
money to  take a trip to Europe, and th
ey came incidenta
lly with the Queen 
Elizabeth, which was a luxury boat, mo re 
or less. And we met in London after 

these many years, and she found that we lo
ve each other as we did before and we 
decided to marry, and so we married. 
And yesterday it was 50 years since we 
married. Of course we never expected that
 -- is that we would marry -- we met in 
Paris. We were bo-both born in Vienna. 
We never expected that we would marry 
in the Royal Borough of Kensington,
 in -- which is part of London. 
Q: Well, congratulations on your 50
th
 anniversary. How did yo
u first get word that 
Elizabeth was even alive? 

A: I mean, I think in July 
nine -- th-the war ended in 
May 1945 and I think by Ju ly 
communications were possible, and I had a 
cousin in America, in New York and 

knew -- he knew Elizabeth an
d he knew my address, an
d I had written to him and 
so I [indecipherable] Elizabeth. 
Q: And how did you lo cate
 -- how did you lo cate he
r? Did you write her? 
A: Yeah.

Q: So you were married i -- af
ter -- a week after you were -- 
A: Right, right, something -- something like this, yes. 
Q: And that was a surprise to you, or -- 

A: No, no, no, we intended to marry. 
Q: Oh yeah? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You knew that you were 
going to -- to see her and th at you would probably  ask 
her to marry you? 
A: Yes, yes, yes.  
Q: Then, how long before
 you came to America? 

A: I came to be married in June 1947, an
d I came to America in February 1948. 
Q: And you had to remain
 in Britain for awhile? 
A: I had, because you see, at that time 
American immigration 
was based on quotas 
and the quotas depended on
 the pla -- on the co untry where you were born. So  I 
was not born in Czechoslovaki
a, I™m Viennese born, so I was in the Austrian 
quota. And because of persecution, 
and the Austrian quota was always 
oversubscribed, it was very difficult to get 
a visa. And I got priority because after 
having married, I was the husband of an American citizen. Elizabeth was already 
an American.  
Q: So what was that like, 
coming to Amer
ica in 1948? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
20
A: Oh, to come to America was very im
pressive and it wasn™t very encouragin g 
because you wondered how you
 can withstand all the in
stitution tha -- I mean, not 
the institution but the way of
 life that you didn™t know. 
It took so me time. Takes 
every immigrant some time before he gets
 somehow settled. And that affects all -- 

all phases, all aspects of life. For instance,
 when I came to America, on the first or 
second day, I asked when we 
have to go to  the police to register. I didn™t realize 
and couldn™t understand th at you don™t 
have to go to  the police and register. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
A: -- and one of the most amazin g  -- amazi
ng experiences was that I had to go -- I 

had to have a document notarized. And I 
was told -- and I asked where is the 
notary public, and I was told it™s the newspaper man at the corner. I couldn™t 

imagine that a newspaperman could be 
the notary public, b
ecause in Europe a 

notary public was a man of a certain standi
ng, like a lawyer, with a big office. So I 
went around the newspaper stand, I was l
ooking fo r a sign th at this is the notary 
public, until I realized, or somebody made my  mistake understood to me. 

Q: So, you were 
still disoriented. 
A: Yeah -- so -- but a -- but yeah, cli 
-- they are little things and I think all 
Americans, or most Americans -- no, a
ll Americans except the Indians hail from 
immigrants. But the present generation and 
those who have se -- have -- who have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
21
been -- who -- who -- who are natives of Am
erica don™t realize what it means to be 
an immigrant anywhere, not only in Amer
ica. For instance -- after all I was a 
person of common sense, I didn™t know how to
 do certain things at the post office, 
because your -- the way the post office wo
rked here is different from how it works 
in Europe. Now, that™s the other way aroun
d to, if you move to Europe, or to  any 
other country. 
Q: And how was your English 
when you first came to -- 

A: Well, I could speak, but it -- it was br
oken, it was broken English and I really 
have ne -- never fully acqui
red a mastery of English. 
Q: So what were your impressions of -- 
other than the examples that you gave, 
about the notary -- 

A: Well, the impression were overwhelmi
ng, primal -- primarily because America 
is more advanced in many respects than
 Europe. And number two, I came from 
war-torn Europe, wh ich had fallen back 
beyond th e time when  the war broke out. 
Even  in England, conditions 
were pretty tough as comp
ared to pre-war times, to 
peace. And the American ci
vilization is quite diffe
rent from the European 
civilization. So there are many aspects a
nd many details which we have to learn 
about, to which we ha
ve to get accustomed. 
Q: Elizabeth said that -- that it was the fr
eedom that was remark
able. Being able to 
just walk down the street. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
22
A: Yeah, that was remarkable, not onl
y the freedom in comp arison to wh at 
happens now, also the safety and security
. For instance, I work
ed -- when I was in 
New York, when I studied, I worked in
 a typewriter shop. And sometimes we 
were told by our bosses to bring a typewr
iter somewhere to some part of the town, 
to the Lower East Side, to deliver it ther
e. T h ere was no fear whatsoever that 
somebody would take the typewriter away. Th
ere was no fear at all at that time, 
when I came to America, th
at somebody would attackyou, that somebody will 
mug you. 

Q: So what were your plans wh en you 
came to America, 
did you have any? 
A: I had no plans.  
Q: And how did you [indecipherable] 
A: I thought it™s -- it™s -- it™s 
reasonable to try to continue my  studies. And that 
what I did during th e first two years. But 
I wasn™t sure whether my studies would 
help me and whether I -- whether I would 
succeed in getting a reasonable position, 
or a reasonable job.  

Q: What was -- what was it that you wanted to do? 
A: I really didn™t know
 what I wanted to do. 
Q: You were doing odd jobs? 
A: Yeah, but the odd jobs I did only beca
use I was studying. I wanted to finish my  
studies. I wasn™t very hope
fu l that would help me. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
23
Q: And were you going -- you were going to
 school wh ile you were living in New 
York ? 
A: Oh yes, I went -- from the very beginnin
g I went to school for about two years, 
then I made my Master™s -- I got my Mast
er™s degree and then I was able, with the 
help of Elizabeth™s father to get a job 
as junior instructor at Johns Hopkins 
University. That was miserably paid. Elizab
eth worked in -- we were in Baltimore, 
Elizabeth worked in 
the veteran™s hospital and that we were -- that what we were 

living from. And then I decided I cannot 
continue living on su ch a small salary, 
which practically was no salary. I have 
to look for another job, and Baltimore 
being near Washington, I went to Washin
gton looking fo r a job and I got one and I 
got first -- I got a very good offer in th
e treasury, but I needed a job immediately  
so I got a summer job in the Department of Agriculture, a two month™s job and s -- 

out of these two months became 40 years. 

Q: You studied political science, or
 what did you study at Hopkins? 
A: Economics.  
Q: Economics. And wh en was it that you d
ecided that that™s what you wanted  to 
do? 
A: Oh, the moment I came -- the moment 
I came, I think the second or third day 
after my arrival, I decided I have to con
tinue my  studies. I had studied in Euro pe, 
too. And the question what 
to study was clear, economics. It seemed to be clear. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
24
Q: Why was that 
clear to you? 
A: Because it seemed to be a practical 
occupation, not to remove from life, not 
necessarily a research [ind
ecipherable] you can make research in economics, but it 
dealt with contemporary ev
en ts. And th at, of course, was of great interest.  
Q: When did you become an American citizen?  

A: In 1950, bec -- I didn™t have to wait fi
ve years because my  visa was based on 
my -- on Elizabeth being an American c
itizen. So after two years I became a 
citizen. 
Q: Was that significant for you? Was it very meaningful? 
A: Oh, certainly it was very meaningful. 
It was more than meaningful, it was a 
major event, because you mu
stn™t forget, we always 
speak about the Holocaust 
and of -- and of persecution. But th e fact th
at we were refugees before, meant th at 
we were odd man out, we had no legal 
status. We had no country to which we 
could appeal for protection. No body cared fo
r us. So to be again -- to have ag ain a 
little status, and what was more, to be an 
American citizen was grandiose. So that 
was certainly a great event. 

Q: Was it in a -- in a room or a place where a lot of people were? 

A: No, no, it was my  cousin  -- my  sec
ond co usin who is now dead , and I don™t 
know who else went with me. Elizabeth? 
I don™t think Elizabeth. Somebody. Wa -

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
25
- no, it was just a judge and it was a ba -- the -- the -- I mean, the event alone was -
- the fact of the event 
was impr -- impressive. 
Q: What -- what did it mean to you then to be an American? 
A: Well, to be the citizen of a big country, which was a free country , and a 
humane country, but I -- I -- I mean, I woul
dn™t say I™m -- I never believed I am a 
Yankee, or I could become a Yankee. I wa
s a citins -- citizen of the United States. 
And don™t forget, I was born under an emperor and I was an Austrian citizen. And 

then the empire collapsed, 
then I became a Czechoslova
kian citizen. Then I was 
nothing, because there was no Czechoslova
kia any mo re and nobody else wanted 
to recognize our nationality. Then -- so wh
en I became an American citizen, this 
had many aspects, man y  positive aspects,
 but from a very personal point of view, 
it meant that was again -- that I wa -- I wa
s again irregularized. What is a man who 
has no co untry? He™s a nobody in the sense of the world. 

Q: Was there -- I-I™m sure there were nega
tive aspects of -- of your -- your arrival 
to America and your -- your transition. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What -- what were some of 
them -- were the hardest things? 
A: I don™t think there were any negative as
pects. I was not very encourag ed that I 
would be able to succeed. I mean, I was in
terested in economics. I was interested 
in studying and then  teaching, th at was 
very nice, in Johns Hopkins, so it was a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
26
modest position. But teaching there was very 
nice and I liked it. But I couldn™t see 
how I could return to  a normal, middle cl
ass life, because during s -- up to the time 
I had gotten a job in  the government, I wa
s not mi -- I was not middle class, I was 
very far down, no, that didn™t -- that wa
s no hardship. That was one of the positive 
aspects of America, th at in spite of the f
act th at I had very, very, very little money, 
I could have a breakfast which was rich
er than the breakfast of a European 
minister of that time. Unless he dealt 
on the black market, he couldn™t have a 
breakfast, at that time, whic
h cons -- for less than one 
dollar I could buy toast with 
butter, a piece of bacon on it, orange juice 
-- imagine orange juice at that time in 
Europe -- compared to Europe, and -- a
nd coffee. So I wasn™t suffering in any 
way. 
Q: Why did you have su
ch doubts abou
t your ability to 
ex -- succeed? 
A: Because we didn™t know how -- I didn™
t know how to succeed in America. Y ou 
know it only afterwards. You cannot judge 
an experience which you don™t have. 
Q: You -- did you -- you consider yourself
 an ambi -- ambitious person before th e 
war? Did you have 
a-ambitions and -- 
A: No, I am not ambitious, but I am 
interested in many things, and I am 
particularly interested in history, no
t only for academic 
reasons, but I lived 
through it. You know, we -- we lived in 
Czechoslovakia and duri
ng my earlier life 
in a very, very upsetting time.
 I mean, the collapse, for 
instance, of Austria was a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
27
major, ma jor event. And th e collapse of Czechoslovakia, the abandonment of -- of 
the Czechs [indecipherable] E
ngland. All these were majo
r events which affected 
us, of course. So, it was difficult to fi
nd, at the beginning, a sat isfac t o ry 
orientation. One didn™t know
 what™s going 
to happen.  
Q: Di-Did people wa -- in your first 
few years in America, did people ask you 
where you were from, what had happened to  
you? Were they curious, did you talk 
to them about wh
at had happened ? 
A: Well, you know, when you asked for 
-- when you applied for a job in New 
York City, people were not
 allowed to ask you where you are coming from. It™s -- 
you know, in -- in order to -- to avoid 
any discrimination. Bu t on the other hand, 
people had not the slightest idea of the Ho
lo caust. That™s a phenomenon that™s an -
- a -- a subject which became interesting on
ly in the 80™s. Once 
a la -- I told the 
lady -- I don™t know any mo re who it was, bu
t I remember the even
t, that I was in 
a camp. And she said, what did you do to 
get into a camp? She had no idea. I -- in 

-- when I arrived in -- in the summer of 19 
-- 1948, I had a -- an eczema. It wasn™t 
dangerous, but it was all over my  body 
and I had to be hospitalized. And the 
people in Mount Sinai hospital didn™t -- 
also, they saw my 
number here, they 
didn™t want to accept me because I had -- 
I couldn™t promise that
 I would pay. So 
th -- there was a -- tha-that™s a very inte
resting phenomenon. No
w there™s so much 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
28
talk and fuss about the Holo caust. But peop
le here discovered this only -- well, I 
would say in  the 80™s, not before. 
Q: People ask about the number on your arm? 

A: No, they didn™t even know what it is. 
I mean, you know, that was, for instance, 
one of the great contrasts between Americ
a and Europe, because in America -- in 
Europe people knew ab out the Nazi regime
, and it was not only a Jewish affair, 
thousands of non-Jews, 10 thousands, hundr
ed thousands [indeci
pherable]. When 
you heard what the Pope said when  he wa
s in Poland, he s -- he went to a place 
where 135 Polish intellectuals, officers
, had been arrested and sent to 
concen tration camps. It was German policy. And all of them died.  
Q: So people weren™t asking you -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- or inquiring. Were you telling 
anyone, were you talking about it? 
A: No, because nobody was 
no -- in the first place nobo
dy was interested. In the 
second place, the few people who were interest
ed were afraid to hear ster -- and 
still are, still afraid to hear
 stories about concentration 
camps. All this talk avoids 
talking about what happened
 in concentration camp. Be
cause the listener identifies 
himself or herself with the person who te
lls the story and is afraid and sh rinks 
away. I mean, people go as far as Anne Fr
ank because she doesn™t speak of in -- of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
29
g -- of cruelties. It™s a sad 
story, but it™s not a story where all the bestiality of the 
SS comes to the fore. 
Q: Was that frustrating to yo
u or would you rath
er have, at that point not have 
talked about it? 
A: Well, I was always willing. I think one 
should talk about it, it™s a -- it™s a major 
event. But I was not frustrated, I mean, 
you consider people 
as being ig norant, 
because -- and not understanding
 the time in which they ar
e living, if they show no 
interest. But I know why they show no inte
rest, they do show interest, but they™re 

afraid of it. 
Q: Was it still very much 
alive for you a -- at -- 
A: Well, yes.  
Q: Is it still? 
A: Well, you know, the years have diminish
ed the liveliness of the experience. On 
the other hand, due to  the fact that Eliz
abeth worked in the 
Holocaust Museum, it 
is now nearer to me as it would have be
en had I not -- had Elizabeth not wo rk ed 
there. I -- w h at did I want to say now? 
I don™t know. I wanted
 to say something. 
Q: Wa -- about Elizabeth had gone over -- 

A: No, no. No, no. I mean, my
 interest in the 
Holocaust, I know wh
at I wanted to 
say. In Europe, those of us who had surv
ived ex -- talked all the time and all the 
time and all the time ab out our experiences
. And of course you -- you learn from 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
30
each other new things, whic
h we personally hadn™t ex
perienced. But on -- on -- on 
-- on -- on -- on -- because of this and becaus
e I was always interested in history, 
and I have read a lot ev -- of -- about 
the Holo caust before the mu seum started 
here, I™m in terested in, certainly. 
Q: How much did Elizabeth 
know about what ha
ppened to you in
 your early years 
and when  did -- when  did you 
start telling her the details? 
A: Well, she knew in  general what ha
s happened. But, I 
mean, she hadn™t 
experienced it either, and she was in the 
same category as the non-survivors. Non-
survivors in the sense of not ha
ving gone thro ugh this phase. 
Q: She described finding so mething at 
-- at the -- at the mu seum about -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- about Auschwitz and -- and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and I suppose -- and she said she hadn™
t known a-about it, so that you hadn™t 
gone into great detail about your experience. 
A: No, you cannot, because it™s very co
mplex story. For instance, I was in 
Auschwitz, but what was Auschwitz? Ausc
hwitz was a series of camps, not one 
camp. And one of the camps was Birken
au, where people came to be killed 
immediately. In the other camps, where we
 worked, many people
 were killed, and 
people died. For instance, I was lucky not
 to die of hunger. I was once near the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
31
point wh ere I thought I couldn™t continue any mo re. So it™s a very comp lex 
subject, very comp lex subject. 
Q: Do you remember the first ti
me telling Elizabeth in detail? 
A: Oh yes, I think that was probably 
still in -- in eng -- in England, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Sorry. 

Q: But she had said there was a -- ther
e was a gray period where you ju st didn™t 
discuss it, because she wasn™t sure -- 
A: Oh. I never hesitated to discuss it w
ith anybody. It was the f -- th e fear of 
others, of your listeners, which we -- you 
noticed, which discourag ed you to speak 
about the details.  

Q: When  -- when  did you talk to  your
 daughter Nicole ab
out your experience? 
A: Oh, I -- slowly. You cannot tell such a story to a child, still 
less when you™re in 
Germany with the -- when we came to Ge
rmany, I mean, I was attaché in Bonn, 
she was six years old. And she did -- she 
went five days into the amer -- an 
American school, but on th e sixth day we sent her to a German -- on Saturday  she 

had to go to a German school, you know, 
to learn German, and sh e hated to go to 
school and she hated to learn German, sh
e learned it much later. And under such 
circumstances you co uldn™t tell her where we are and what happened. Bu t she 
learned it.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
32
Q: Maybe you can go back an
d you -- you started to talk
 about your 40 years with 
the -- working for the -- 
A: Oh yeah, yes. 

Q: -- United States government. If you coul
d go back to the chr
onology of -- of -- 
A: Yes, well, Johns Ho pkins, they  paid 
very, very badly and I also wasn™t -- I 

learned a lot there and I was very happy to
 teach there, but I also wasn™t happy 
about the ivory -- ivory situation of th
e school. It was far removed from the -- 
Q: Ivory tower? 
A: Ivory tower. It was far re
moved of real life. So I looked for a job and I found a 
job, a temporary job, which 
then lasted 40 years. And I was very happy in that job 
for many reasons. First of all, it w as a rath
er solid position -- a 
comparatively solid 
position. Number two, the subject was ve
ry, very interesting. It was a world 

agriculture, world trade, trade policy, very
, very interesting subject. And I and all 
those who work ed in  the Department of Ag ri
culture on this particular subject were 
very lucky because we learned about fore
ign policy, we follo
 -- followed foreign 
policy developments in fore
ign countries. And from a purely intellectual point of 
view, we had a very interesting job. And 
I was in the Department of Agriculture. 
First I didn™t advance, then I advanced 
gradually. And -- and I -- I was very happy 
there, even is -- even
 when I didn™t advance, I wasn™t
 that -- I wasn™t happy not to 
advance, but I was happy there, I liked th
e work. And in 1959 
I was appointed to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
33
be assistant agricultural att
aché at the American embassy
 in Germany. I was there 
from ™59 to ™64 and then I was transferre
d to Brussels to the common market. And 
there I was agricultural atta
ché for 10 years. And I prob
ably could have stayed 
there forever, but I got an offer to lead the American agricultural delegation in a 
big trade negotiation in Geneva. It wa
s called t h e Tokyo round because the 
decision to enter such nego
tiations was made in Tokyo.
 So I was then s -- seven 
years -- no, over seven years, six years -- 
less than seven years, six years in 
Geneva, then I came back to Wash ington. 
I was here for two years and then I was 
appointed agricultural attaché -- no, counsel
or. Counselor for agricultural affairs at 

the American embassy in Paris. So we ca
me back to France 
again, and that was 
very nice. So my  whole ca
reer was very nice and ve
ry  satisfactory and very 
interesting. 

Q: And when did you finally retire? 

A: In 1990, seven years ago. 

Q: What was that like, going to  Germany and living th ere? 
A: Well, you know, German is my mother
 tongue. I have, except for -- well, for 
the American studies and for the one year
 in Czechoslovakia after the war, where I 
went to the Czech university, I have on
ly German schools. I have German grade 
school, German -- what is called the gy
mnasium, which is 
mo re than the high 
school here, but approximately in this ca
tegory of schooling. And I went to the -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
34
to graduate [indecipherable] at the German
 university in Prague before the war. 
After the war the German university didn
™t exist any more. And I went for one 
year to the Czech univers
ity. And both the Ge
rman and the Czech university had 
the names, Charles University. So I was 
very familiar with German -- and I had 
never lived in Germany, but still coming to
 Germany -- except in the concentration 
camp, I was familiar with their way of talk
ing, with their way of thinking. I was 
very familiar with everything, which f
acilitated my work. At that time most, not 
all, but most of the people with whom I d
ealt, were former Nazis. Of course, they 
were hiding it, but they  couldn™t hide 
it. I didn™t discuss anything with them, but 
you know th e way th ey  spoke, I mean, not
 specifical, th ere were -- there was no 

question about this, I mean, this --  
Q: There was no question -- 
A: No, except one little incidence, but I me
an they were all good democrats, th ey 
said, but they were not. Now when I sp
eak of those people, I mean primarily 
government official, and rela
tively high government official
s, with exception, with 
exception. But for me it was fun because I understood that -- and I mean, I could 

see through them.  

Q: It was fun. 
A: It was fun. We had one incident wh ich 
is remarkable. We ran a restaurant in a 
little town in Germany, Elizabeth and I, 
and we overheard a conversation at the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
35
next table, where one person said, no, He
rr doctor, that goes too far. Expel yes, 
burning -- to burn them, no. And [indeciph
erable] said, all of 
them shouldhave 
been burned, there ar
e still some survivor. 
Q: You overheard that? 
A: Oh yeah, we overheard that. 
Q: How did that make you feel? 

A: Well, it was laughable, I mean, you see,
 Nazism is a very complex per -- very, 
very comp lex problem. It requires a lot to
 understand why it happened, who did it. 
For instance, those who were the SS, thos
e people who were in the concen tration 
camps and killed people and to
rtured people, these were the lowest of the lowest. 
You know? These were at the margin of so
ciety. The others acquiesced in it. Take 
the German government. Hitler was a man w
ho had no career before he became a 

politician. Goering was a -- a former office
r who didn™t find his 
bearings after the 
war. They were all people at the margin of
 society. But these 
people didn™t kill, I 
mean, all -- at -- at the top. But those wh
o were in the camps, the SS, the SA and 
those from the -- the police battalions wh
o were in Poland and killed not only 
Jews, but thousands, 10 thousands of Pole
s. These people were really the -- the 
scum of the earth. Really, fro
m every point of view the scum of the earth and they 
were also, I would say, the sc
um of the German people.  
Q: You were associatin g with -- with 
people who perhap s gave the orders -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
36
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that were somehow involved -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in a higher level -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and I would th ink that would -- that
 would make -- part of me would be -- 
would be very upset and angry at 
-- at having to associate with -- 
A: Well, you -- you -- you couldn™t iden
tify this or that person as being a 
murderer, you couldn™t do that. But yo
u knew what the attitude was.  
Q: But you -- you had said it was -- it was fu
n or amusing. Was there a part of you 
that was -- 
A: Well, imagine during my stay in Germany, and even when I was in -- in 
Brussels, I used to go to  
the so-called Green Week, 
which was an agricultural 
exhibition in Germany -- in -- in Berlin. 
An exhibition which ha
d a long tradition. 
Every year by th e end of January , there wa
s this big exhibition. And at two or 
three occasions, I was invited, together
 with other people to dinner by the 
president of Germany. So where I was sitti
ng? Not next to him, but th is was a long 
dinner table and I was invited to dinner 
by the president of Germany. Certainly 
that was amusing, it gave me a lot of sa tisfaction, because I-I realized, and I qui -- 

I thought of it, I was co ndemned to die.
 I was not only condemn ed  to be in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
37
camp, all o f us were destined to die,
 by the highest authorities of the German 
Reich. An d now here is another highest
 authority, highest 
authority at least 
formally, of the German Reich and I was his invitee.  
Q: You had defied --you someho
w defied them. [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, yeah. So that was 
-- I mean -- well, you know, if
 a child is bad -- suppose 
you have a very bad child, 
you don™t hate the child, y
ou try to understand. And I 
wouldn™t say that I didn™t hate the N
azis, I certainly hated them. And I say 
[indecipherable] the scum of the earth, but
 I try to understand. And my  feeling is 
that apart from this lowest level of 
society, the guilt of the German people 
consisted in acquiescence, rather than in
 active persecution. On  the other hand, 

there was resistance, and there were so 
many shades of attitudes, like these two 
people wh o -- but there were many mo re shaped like these two people whom we 

overheard in the restaurant. And one said ex
pel, the other said kill, and so  on and 
so on and so on. And th en, how can you 
ju dge any nation? A nation consists of 
millions of people. How can you really judg
e and know what their feelings are and 
what their attitude are? And one important 
thing, no country in modern times has 
suffered such dictatorship as the German
 people. It was incredible, it was -- th e 
dictatorship alone was German efficien
cy. And the Germans, who believed they  
are courageous, were afraid. And how co
uld you -- how could you oppo -- if you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
38
opposed it you were -- you -- you -- you were 
killed yourself, or you were sent to a 
concentration camp, at least.  
Q: Did you go back to Au
schwitz after the war? 
A: No, I didn™t go back, bu
t not because of any fear of being overcome by 
emotions, but simply for th
e following reasons. When I was in Germany, or in -- 
no, in Brussels, I once made a trip  to Fr ance and I visited the military camp where 

I had served  in southern  France. And th ere was nothing left. I didn™t recognize the 

place. I knew that was the place. The barrack
s had gone, there was no spirit in it. 
And I know when I go to 
Auschwitz, there is no shout
ing SS, no fear. What you 
see are remnants of a different time. They
 don™t tell me  anything. I have my  own 
memo ries, but the memo ries will not be revived. 
Q: You didn™t feel as thou
gh th ere was any use for you -- 
A: There is no -- 
Q: -- personally to go. 

A: -- no, there is no use. Yeah, I was w
ith Elizabeth last year in Austria and 
another person who was with us wanted to  
see Mauthausen, and they went th ere. I 
didn™t go along, but not because I -- I 
am afraid I would be emotionally di-
distressed. It is not the same. Wh
at you see are not living things.  
Q: Mm-hm.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: Because Elizabeth was not at a -- a concentration camp -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or -- or an extermination camp, 
do you not consider her a survivor? 
A: No, a survivor -- the question is what
 do you su rviv e? If you were not in a 
concen tration camp you™re not a survivor 
of a concentration camp . If you were not 
in a battle, you™re not surviv
or of this battle. No, I mean -- oh yes, she is a -- sh e 
was persecuted, she had her own experien
ces. But that™s one thing. One cannot 
speak of survivors who didn™t surv ive a 
certain -- a certain event or a certain 
process. On the other hand, there is no mer
it to be a survivor and nobody has to be 
proud of -- of having been a survivor. Yo
u can be -- no, one shouldn™t be proud at 
all. I think pariet -- parietes should not be
 applied. On e can be satisfied, one can be 
happy to have survived or satisfied  to ha
ve shown resistance and courage. Bu t to 

be proud? The Bible says pride co meth befo
re the fall. I mean, I just mention this, 
but there is no merit in it. 
Q: You hear a lot about survivor™s guilt. 
Have you ever experi
enced any of that? 
A: No, th at™s nonsen se. What kind of guilt? 
Did they do anything wrong, that they 
survived ? They  should be happy that th
ey survived. You kno
w, there are many 
false stories, there™s a whole my thology 
about the survivor and the survivor™s 
children. The children are in
fluenced by ha-having learned about wh at happened 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
41
to the parents, naturally, but why should
 anybody be guilty 
that you survived? 
Why? It™s ridiculous. 
Q: How do you think Nicole, your dau
ghter was influenced by you being a 
survivor? 
A: She learned it gradually and it -- she understands, I think. You know, she also 
had th -- she went -- she was with us in
 Germany and she went to the German 
school, and she hated school and she hated 
this. But then she -- 
when she came to -
- when we were in Brussels, we sent her 
to a school wh ere you -- the children were 
taught in their mother tongue, in -- a
nd in a foreign language. Now, there was 
however, only a limited numb er of langua
ges which were considered  mo ther 
tongue, and English was at that time not considered the mother
 tongue for a child. 
So she went to courses which were in 
German, wh ich was considered her mo ther 
tongue, and in French. Geog
raphy was in French, histor
y was in German and so 
on. And she learned German in Brussels 
at the school, not in Germany. No , she -- 
she has a very objective attitude, and yo
u know, she has such
 a -- very good 
experiences about Germany. And I mu st 
say, I was going to -- I have gone to 
German grade school, I repeat this, to
 German high school, to German -- to 
German university. And in grad e st-sc
hool, my  teacher was a neo-Nazi, probably 
later on was a Nazi. In  -- in -- in the -- in 
high school for eight years, the head of 
the teachers was a Nazi. And I had good ex
periences with him, but that doesn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
42
excuse they™re Nazis and that
 was their stupidity. But af
ter all, I had very  good 
German friends. Chauvinism is really a hi
gh degree of ig norance [indecipherab le]. 
Chauvinism is a high degree of stupidity
. Why should one h
it somebody because 
he speaks another language, or he is forma
lly and really part of another nation of 
people. Only  people who are very, very
 narrow minded have such views or 
attitudes.  
Q: Have you -- you talk in
 the video about the Polish officer, the former Polish 
officer -- 
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: -- who saved your life -- 

A: Kubacic. 
Q: -- a couple of times. Hav-Have you -- di
d you ever talk to him after the -- after 
the war? 
A: No, I -- you know, the story is as fo
llows. When I was in 
Vernet, which was a 
horrible French concen tration camp , but we 
were not beaten or tortured, we were 
hungry an d we -- people starved to death, 
I was there by mistake,
 as they said, so 
to facilitate -- to ease my position, I was 
made assistant postmaster, which meant I 
could circulate in the camp  and distri
bute -- distribute the mail. And one day 
Kubacic came to me, I hadn™t known him,
 and asked me wher -- and asked me 
whether I could give the letters and th e re
st to him -- to him personally, because 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
43
the French officials who were
 in there took the stamps
 away and his letters had 
very beautiful stamps. And so I became 
acquainted with him without knowing him 
really. And when  we were de
ported in the train, alr
eady in Poland and we moved 
through the city of Katowice, he was standi
ng next to me -- you know, in th e train, 
the train moved thro ugh th e city of Katowi
ce, he was standing next to me and he 
had this -- the -- the strong 
desire to talk to somebody.
 And since he knew me, he 
talked to me and he to ld me he™s not Je
wish. And he cannot sa
y what he really -- 
that he™s -- that he was 
a Polish Intelligence officer. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And then he helped me -- that was 
at the time when I broke down out of 
hunger, and he was able to -- you know, he was our kapo and as kapo, he was 
supervising the food rations which we got. 
And he managed to let me  have two of 
rations. And in this way I 
ris -- I recovered again. 
Q: Do you know wh at happen
ed to him after the war? 
A: Yes. Well, I don™t know, but the end of th e story is -- I don™t know wh ether I 

told this in the first inte
rview. I was on good terms with him, he had helped me. 
And one day he started to shout to -- s
hout at me and beat me. And I didn™t 
understand what has happene
d. Two -- two weeks later 
he had escaped. And he 
beat me and shouted  at me so
 that nobody ca -- he was very decent -- that nobody 
believed that I known about his plan to escap
e. And about a year later we read in a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
44
French paper -- you know, pa
pers were smuggled into  the camp . There were 
[indecipherable] many French
men and sometimes it was a piece of a paper, but 
there was a paper, a Parisian paper which st ated that six -- six French resistance  
fighter had been arrested and executed. An
d they gave the name
s. And one of the 
names was Stanislaw Kubacic. Now wh
ether it was the same, I don™t know.  
Q: Do you ever go to  any re
unions, or do you ever meet up
 or talk with any of the 
other surv ivors at your [indecipherable] camp -- 

A: No, I have a friend who happened to be 
in the same camp as I w as, but I don™t 
know -- I don™t know any surv ivors here. I w
ould be interested to talk to people, 
but I don™t know any.  

Q: What would you be interested in talking to them about? 
A: Because, when you talk 
to people who have the sim 
-- a similar experience as 
you, you learn about new details which you 
didn™t experience, or which you didn™t 
know. Also, recollectio ns came -- come ba
ck if you talk w
ith somebody you -- 
there might be an event which you ha
ve entirely forgotten. And somebody 
mentions something in this context and th
e event comes back to
 you, and you start 
to rememb er. 
Q: Do you talk to your friend wh
o lives in this area about -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
45
A: Oh yes, yes, we talk, yeah. Well, 
he doesn™t -- you know, he™s now in a 
situation where he talks all the -- all 
the time about the camp
, but sometimes he 
doesn ™t want to hear about it.
 It doesn™t matter to me.  
Q: How -- is it always on your
 mind, do you think about it 
a lot, is it never far? 
A: Well, you know, I had -- up to  now, 
no w my  memo r y  weak
ens very strongly. 
But I had an excellent memo ry. I don™t 
know why, I cannot explain. You might 
have noticed that I said on the 14
th
 of February we went to Czechoslova -- 
[indecipherable] different year. I rememb
er d ate, I remember many details fro m 
the past. And so  shortly I -- but I live it, 
my  whole past, it™s not only concentration 
camp. So, no doubt that was one of the grea
test events in my life. If I say one, it 
was the greatest, but there was another one , wh ich was of short duration. Bu t I was 
in the Battle of France when France lost 
the war, and to be -- only for a short da -- 
time, under fire, under -- under -- under the fi re of guns, it™s quite an experience. 
But that was the same in 
Au schwitz because we were bomb ed and I was in the 
middle, once. Not all the time. But once 
I w -- the bombs were falling right and 
left. So that -- it wasn 't such a grea
t experience, I™ll tell you why. It was 
intellectually, mentally it™s a bit -- it was 
very noisy . You know, noise is horrible. 
Noise affects you physiologically, physically
. And that was the -- that was the day 
when -- when we were sh
elled by ar-artillery.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
46
Q: I was going to ask you if
 there are any m -- smells or
 tastes or may -- and now -
- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- noises that remin d  of --  
A: Yes. 
Q: -- of that camp. 

A: I have th e strange experience of having
 been led to the gallow, to a temporary 
gallow and th -- together with several 
other boys, and this gallow wh ere they 
wanted to  hang us was one of the cemen
t with a kind of poster which -- you s -- 
you see it very often, you know, wh ere yo
u have a fence, it™s -- it™s a poster wh ich 
is a bit -- a little bit cu
rved, and the fence is fixed on th
is. When I see such a thing, 
I remember it. 

Q: It remin d s you of that. 

A: Oh, it reminds me, yes. But I tell you, 
I have -- I had very few dreams wer -- 
were a-about the concentration camp . I had some about bombing. Bo mb ing was a 
terrible experience, but had very few ni
ghtmares about the concentration camp. 
And yet, I-I think of it, not 
with pleasure, but I think of
 it and what happened. And 
you see, if you talk with 
people who had th e similar 
experience, they remind you 
of certain things which you might have forgotten. 
Q: You had said in -- in the vi
deo that the hanging incident -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
47
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- or the near hanging incident ha
d somehow receded in
 your memory for 
awhile. 
A: Yeah. Right. I say there, or I believe it has receded because there was an 
[indecipherable] to -- to suppress it, you kn
ow? To me -- because it was really -- I 
mean, even the bombs were falling, when 
they  were beating us
, when I -- when I 
was so weak that I gave up really. I was 
about to ga -- give up. I -- I couldn™t do 
any [indecipherable]. That didn™t give you th
e feeling of the imme  -- the feeling of 
immediate death, but this ev
ent, when they wanted to 
hang us, that was really the 
next -- the next thing is nothing. The ne
xt thing you are not 
here any more. And 
that, perhaps, created in me 
the desire to push it aside. 
Q: When did it resurface and 
did you actually forget that
 it happened, or you just 
sort of pushed it way back? 
A: You know, I have written my souven irs 
-- my memoirs, and 
they are 420 pages, 
my whole life. It starts with my birth, 
until 1990. And of course a large part is 
devoted to the camp experience. And there, when I started to write this, then it 

came back, in all clarity. It was here, I knew about it. 

Q: What year was that when  you started writing? 
A: Oh, a couple of years ago.  
Q: Mm-hm. Was there anything that triggered it, that -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
48
A: No, I decided, I mean, since I had a ma -- an extremely na -- a life full of 
contrasts and fu ll of extraordin ary experi
ences, I should write it down. And I have 
done, but it™s no -- really not finished, an
d I don™t know -- I would like to -- I 
would like to have it published, but not be
cause I am l-looking fo r glory, or -- or 
for a name or something. Just because I 
would like to give it to people and if I 
have it my self published from my  own mo
ney, that costs a lot of money. 
Q: I wanted to go back and -- and as
k you one follow up question about the 
cement poles that you say -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- when you see them, it remin d s 
you of that time that you were -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- almost hung. What -- what -- what
 feeling comes over you? Is it -- is it 
palpable? 
A: Wel -- no, it™s not frightening, but it reminds me of this event. I mean, I -- I -- I 

think there must be such poles here t
oo. I cannot see it without immediately 
having th e association. 

Q: You said you do have nightmares so
metimes, or have had nightmares of -- 
A: No, no, no, no. 
Q: -- of the bombing. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
49
A: Of the bombing, yes. The -- and you 
know, that was an additional enemy. We 
had the -- th e SS and we had th e hunger, 
the beating of the -- by the SS, but the 
bombing was something -- an
 extraordinary event. 
Q: I was curious to read where you though
t the bombing of th -- o-of the railroad 
line would have been insign
ificant because they woul
d have built it back up and 
that™s a -- 
A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: -- I mean, still to this day a debate. 
A: Yes. I say this because I myself has 
-- have worked on rebuilding trucks and I 
know how fast it  goes. And you know, if 
-- if the -- the rail -- 
the -- the rails to 
Auschwitz had really been 
bombed, so the Germans woul
d have taken the people 
out and shot them. They were able to 
shoot thousands, 10 thousands. It™s, for 
instance interesting that the story I hear
d about my  mo ther -- and I heard it from 
two sources, spoke always of
 30,000. 30,0 00 people havi
ng been  massacred there. 
In the literature about the 
Holocaust and about massacres, I think I™ve never read 
about 30,000. Perhaps Babi Jar, but I don™t 
know whether they have been killed at 
the same time.  
Q: You had read -- I had read in -- in -- in 
the transcripts of your video that you -- 
you said you considered that you 
had a lot of luck in your life. 
A: Oh yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
50
Q: Do you still consider your
self lucky, or fortunate? 
A: Yes, lucky -- luck -- lucky -- chance 
is the right word, because chance is a 
double meaning. It™s chance [indeciphera
ble] and it™s chance opportunity , yes. So I 
was lucky because I had -- there were chan
ces. And the chances 
were just chance 
and -- but also opportunity. I am satisfied
 -- not proud, but satisfied that I took 
certain decisions wh ich were very dangerou
s, but I dared to take them. One was to 
get in -- to get into hidi
ng when the camp was evacuat
ed because if they had 
caught us, they would have 
killed us. They were very 
jittery. The SS was very 
jittery, they were afraid. And there were 
other occasions where I took very risky 
decisions, but I felt that has to be done, 
that is the impor -- the thing to do. And 
now I am older -- not only older, I™m old 
now, which is -- which amuses me . You 
know why it amuses me? It amuses me 
because I remember my  grandfather, and 
how old -- I mean, I was on good terms with
 my  grandfather, but how distant in 
age he was to me as a boy. Oh, I -- I 
express it by showing you with my  hands 
where he was. And now I am in
 his -- a-at -- in this age. 
Q: Does it feel -- still feel distant? 

A: Yeah, yeah. I was in Vienna with a co
lleague a couple of years ago, and we 
saw -- we -- we -- we saw -- we passed some [indecipherable] elderly  man, well 
dressed and very respectfully l -- I was l-
looking. And I said to him, look, there 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
51
still are -- seem to be people whom we ow
e respect to, but we are their age. We 
look the same as they do. 
Q: I-I™m cu rious about the -- the fellow 
survivor who is your friend here. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What in particular -- you say some -- on occasions you™ll talk about what 
happened in the 
Holocaust. What [indecipherable] 

A: Well, we -- we often exchange experi
ences, reminiscences 
about the events. I 
didn™t know him in -- in the camp, and he
 is 10 - 15 years younger than I, so he 
was a young bo -- almost still a boy in  the 
camp. He is of German origin, German 
is his mo ther tongue. So -- and he didn™t l
ook Jewish either, so he sometimes had a 
certain advantage from this fact. We ha
d fu n coming -- coming -- you know, there 
was one SS man who both of us knew an
d we called him Tom Mix. Tom Mix was 
a character out -- from out -- out of Ameri
can movies. And as far as I remember, 
Tom Mix was always out either to cheat 
the Indian s, or -- he was a cowb oy or 
something. And this Tom Mix the SS man wa
s similar, he always wanted to  find a 
-- to -- to -- to surprise 
us when  we did something wh
ich we are not supposed  to 
do. 

Q: So you talk about this fellow a
nd -- and sort of make fun of him? 
A: Ye -- yeah, yeah, yeah. 
But of course the memo ries start to vanish. Fo r 
instance, it becomes more and more difficu
lt to visualize the camp. I think, for 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
52
instance, he was probably in
 my neighborhood, in a barr
ack near me, but it™s very 
difficult to visualize this. 
Q: How do y -- this 
is a hard question. 

A: Certainly. 
Q: How di -- does -- how do 
you think the experience 
of having su rvived the 
holocro -- Holocaust a-affected your
 out -- general outlook about life? 
A: Oh, very much. 
Q: Can you talk abou
t it, in what ways? 
A: Yeah, I can say it in a -- in a few word s. Don™t give up. I never gave up except 

when I said I almost di -- died. There I wa
s so weak, I was so weak that I asked for 
permission to stay one day away  from wo
rk. And you know, that was a voluntary 
confession that you cannot wo rk 
any mo re, but I didn™t care.  
Q: Did you have that attitude
 of don™t give up before 
the Holocaust? Were you a 
persistent person, or -- 

A: Yeah, ye-yeah. 
Q: -- did it add to th at? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Oh yes. 

Q: Just made you more -- 
A: Oh yes. I mean, when 
the Nazis occupied  Czechoslo
vakia and they stopped the 
train in which I was and told us to go ba
ck, I envisaged to disregard what they  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
53
were saying and to cross the frontier on 
my  own and then see whether I can cross 
Germany to come to France. I gave this
 -- I gave up because
 I -- I thought -- I 
deliberate and thought it™s too ris
ky, I mean, I will not succeed. 
Q: Did surviving make you -- how did it a
ffect your spirituality? Did it make you 
mo re spiritual, or did it have -- 

A: No, it makes me more realistic. I like 
intellectual activities, but I don™t like 
spiritualism. It makes you realistic. Incide
ntally, realism has its own sp irituality. 
Q: How does it make you more realistic? 
A: Well, you see what is possible. You 
see la -- how human beings behave and 
you see what can happen. I mean, the id
ea of my mother -- 
come back to my 
mother, my mother, a 
very good, nice, non-political mi
ddle class lady to be shot in 
a massacre? That seems to be incomp
rehensible. Unrealistic. Completely 
unrealistic. You can say out of this worl
d, yet it happened. And so many other 
things happened. 
Q: Does it make you question the -- 
the goodness of humanity sometimes? 
A: Human beings are neither 
good or bad, you know, so
me are very bad, because 
they are, as I say, the scum, I mean th
e lowest level, educationally, morally, in 
terms of their experiences. But there ar
e other human beings wi -- who are very, 
very good. Astonish ingly good. Willing to
 sacrifice. No, I think one cannot say 
human beings are bad. There are many 
bad people. You know why? Because

54
they™re weak. And that is one of the ba
sic explanation fo r the behavior of the 
German people. Just think of the fact 
that the Germans were one of the most 
civilized people in the world.
 And they were a Christia
n people, I mean they had 
to learn certain moral -- moral -- moral 
be -- about moral beha
vior. But don™t you 
do what we mu st not do. And th ey acquies
ced in these horrible events, in this 
horrible policy. But they were afraid a
nd fear, fear is one of the mo st potent 
mo tives for human beings.  
Q: Do you consider yourself a 
hopeful or an optimistic person? 
A: Yes, I™m optimistic. Which doesn™t mean
 that we might not anticipate horrible 
things to happen. Ho rrible things. Why,
 the Ho locaust could repeat itself on a 
much larger scale. Or wh
en the Jews were killed as -- su ppose six million were 
killed, 20 million or more, it™s perhaps 30
 million Russians were killed, in one 
way or another. They  were not
 only shot, I mean, they di
ed of starvation after the 
war came to an end. Millions 
of Poles have been killed.
 So there could be a new 
Holo caust -- I don™t mean, necessarily an 
anti-Jewish Holocaust, though it could 
be an anti-Jewish Holocaust. 

Q: Do you think your --
 your testimony and the te
stimony of other survivors 
makes that less of a possibility? 
A: Not to  the same extent 
as some people believe in, particularly the people who 
founded and who promoted 
the Holocaust Museum, becau se the horror of these 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
55
events is not a sufficien t deterrent to prevent its repetition. And moreover, 
concen tration on the Ho locaust alone doesn
™t give you a sufficient explan ation of 
what happened. You cannot 
understand the Holocaust if
 you only speak of the 
Holocaust. You have to see the whole sy
stem which ruled in Germany and which 
was one of the most barbaric syste ms in 
history. Imagine what they  did. Not only 
did they  kill people, mu rder people, but th
ey to ok their teeth, their gold teeth or 
their hair. Now, the most backward peopl
e considered it anathema to utilize parts 
of human bodies. I me an, the -- the cannibals
, that™s a different -- the cannibals are 
something quite different. The Germans,
 the Nazis were below cannibalism. 
Below cannibalism. So did you bringus sandwiches, Liesel? [tape break] 
Q: So I was curious why you agreed to ta ke part in this project and to tell your 
story. 
A: I think it is useful to take part in the project because it may contribute. It does 

not necessarily contribute. It may cont
ribute to make th
e Holocaust or the 
experiences connected ti -- w
ith the Holocaust more plau
sible and understandab le. 
But it probably never can do full justice to
 the experience of the Holocaust. If for 
instance I were to tell you,
 or to somebody else, that
 o n e of the most horrible 
experiences was not hanging an
d beating and killing, but to
 be on a very cold day 
when it was rais -- and raining, the rain 
was a bit icy, in the open, and not being 
pushed by the SS because they we
nt into hiding, they want
ed to protect themselves 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
56
against the rain. And standing th ere from six 
o™clock to  six o™clock in the even ing, 
doing nothing, just standing th ere fre
ezing and shivering, that was an 
extraordin ary experience. Or, how can one 
-- and one doesn™t do 
it really -- is in 
this interview convey  wh
at life is like if you are 
undernourished and hungry. If 
you have no soap, no toothbrus
h fo r months or years. I never had -- I never had the 
toothbrush in the concentration camp . If you™
re comp letely cut off in the outside 
world, that is to say you™re not supposed 
to na -- to write, you
™re not expected to  
or -- or supposed to, or permitted to r
eceive any correspondence from wherever. It 
could have been, if paper taken from ceme
nt bags, which were 
-- was plentiful and 
on th e construction sites -- the only thing which was plentiful, serves as your 
handkerchief, as your toilet paper, as a me
ans of protecting yourself against the 
cold. This is difficult to convey, but ho
wever little you can conve
y, may be useful. 
Q: You seem to talk about these thin
gs with now a sense of detachment. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Was it always that way, or -- 
A: No. We were in a relatively favorable
 position, as far as our attitude was 
concerned. When  we were in the camp s,
 the greatest powers in the world, 
America, England and 
Russia fought against the Nazis.  So there were our allies. 
And whate -- whatever success they had was 
our success, it was a st ep nearer to 
liberation. I always think that in this re
spect we were favored, if you compare us 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
57
with the prisoners in Russian
 camps. They had no hope that
 Stalin will die, or if 
Stalin will die, there will be another Sta
lin. They had no hope, 
or hardly any hope 
that the regime would change and that they
 would be libera -- that they can expect 
liberation. For us the situation was, in this
 respect, different and that was the -- th -
- that was the -- th-the -- the -- the idea 
which kept us alive and wh ich made us 
hopeful. 
Q: Do you ever think about 
wh at your life would have 
been like had the Holo caust 
not taken place? 
A: Yes, but I did -- I do not come very
 far. I cannot imagine it. But there was 
another thought wh ich we had particular
ly at the beginning. When we were 
deported to Germany, the question was,
 why are we deported. And while we 
thought of ourselves as work
ers who will have to work, 
why do they dis -- deport 
old people and ch ildren? Wh at sense 
does it make? These people cannot wo rk. 
And there, I personally envisaged that th
e Germans are going to establish a slave 
county or country or area so
mewhere in Ukraine, that™s 
there -- that that is our 
future. We might be slaves forever, if 
we survive. And then, you know, there™s 
another thing, we mu st not think of it 
respectively in the sense of drawing 
conclusion on th e basis of knowledge whic
h one acquired only after an event took 
place. For instance, I didn™t know, and my 
colleagues, we didn™t know that the 
Germans are bent to kill all of us. Really, 
not only all of us, th
at we expected. We 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 
  
 
 
 

 
 
58
were absolutely convinced if they want, 
we were 5,000 in th
is one camp, they 
might decide tomorrow they 
will kill all of us. But that they are going, and are 
bent, and decided to call -- to kill all Je
ws, that never occurred to me, and not to 
the others. I mean that there was the pl
an of mass ec-ex-extermination, that we 
didn™t know.

Q: I do -- I don™t think I have
 any other questions. Is th
ere anything else that you™d 
like to say that -- 
A: No, I have nothing else to say. Ar
e you going to have 
this transcribed? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And can I see a copy before -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- before it is finalized? 

Q: I™m sure you can. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I™ll ask if that™s possible. 

A: Yeah. Because what I should have done
 before we had this interview was to 
write down certain points and deal with
 them, which I didn™t do. And then -- 
Q: Oh, I think you did ju
st fine without them.

A: -- and -- and then it™s a bit incohe
rent, you know. So 
you -- you had the 
systematic questionnaire.  
Q: Somewhat. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Very good, thank you ve
ry much for your effort. 
Q: Thank you fo r your time.
