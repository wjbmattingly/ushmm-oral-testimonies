Here we see Harry and his fam ily in Brussels.  Harry and hisparents 
em igrated
 
to the United 
States in 1951, joining his siblings who em igrated in 1949 and 1950. 
 
 
Af ter arriving in the U.S. in 1951, Harry andhis parents settled in 
S e a ttle , 
W ashington, where his brother and sister had gone totheirm ove.  He went to the

Y
our father settled inBerlin in 1919, married your mother in 
1926.  By the tim e youwere born in 1937, Hitler had com etopower and had been in power  for 
four years.  Bef ore we turn to the war years, tell us what yourf am ily' s lif e was like, what yo
u r 
lif e was like, inthose years beforethe war began. 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I was ver y young
 b
eing born in1937. My father
 
--
 
[Indiscernible], m y 
m other was a housewife.  My brotherand sister were born. W e were som ewhat religious but 
not too religious. They led kind of am iddle class life.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather served in the FirstW orldW ar, hadn'the?
 

>> H a rr y Mark o wi
c z:  Yes.  He was inW orldW ar I
.  H
e was 15. T hey lied about hisage, so he 
was draf tedat 15.  
T
he
re were sk
irm is h e s
 
inPoland and Russia which ledto the war in 1920, 
1921.  He didn't want to go back in the Arm y, so he lef tPoland to goto Berlin.
 
>> B
ill Benson:  And how 
did he 
m eet your mom ?

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  He m et m y m om  at awedding which tookplace in 
Gd
ansk, an 
international city.  T he wedding was
 
--
 
also left Poland in 1919.  So he couldn't goback to 
Poland to marry this Polish young wom an. So they arrangedf or the wedding to be in Gdansk 
andm y father was invited. Af ter the wedding, his partner said, well, now it's your turn.  Said, 
ﬁW
hy don't youpick som ebody among the guests.
ﬂ 
[Laughter]
 
My f atherpicked m y mother. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And 
history
 
was m ade.
 
>> Ha rr y Ma rko wic z:   I  gu e ss so
.  T
hefunny part about that is thatm y m other was planning to 
go back home. They were going to have the wedding later, butm y father insisted that they get 

m arried right then.  Said, 
ﬁS
enda telegram  toyour m other.
ﬂ
  
My gran df ather was dead by then.  
ﬁ
Have her come, and we'll have the wedding
. ﬂ  W e
 
have pictures of thetwo weddings.  T hey 
took place a few days 
apart.W ithin eightdays m y father andm other were m arried. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas lif e likef orthem ,to your knowledge, in Berlin in the late 1920's
, 
early 1930's
, b
efore Hitler came to power
?
  
W hat was their lif e like there? 
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   I
 
don't know much about
 
--
 
I assume thatthey had, asI said, am iddle 
class life and were satisfied living there until the Nazis tookover. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had two siblings.  How large was your extendedf am ily? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  My m other had,as
 
you said earlier, 10 siblings
.  T
here were 11 children.  
My grandfather was dead bef ore the war.  And m yf ather had seven
 
--
 
no, there were seven 
together. Of those,four survi ved, four who had lef tPoland.T he whole f am ily that stayed in

Poland all per
ished.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm e, Harry, thatyour f ather was one ofthose who believed that 
af ter Hitler cam e topower that he wouldn't last, this wouldn't lastfor terribly long.  Say a little 
m ore about that.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  He wasn't the only one. T he Jewish people who were affected 

m ost were professionals, civil ser vants, teachers who were f iredf rom  their jobs, doctors, 
lawyers couldn't practice.  Sofor them  it was crucial to leave.  Andm any of those em igrated.
  
B u t m y fa the r's 
b u siness wa sn ™t  a
ff ected.  He had no street representation to have a shopor 
anything
,  
so he wasn'thurt economically by li ving in Germ any.  Andhe assumedthat it could 
not goon the way it wa s, that the world wouldn't let it happen
; w
ouldn't tolerate thi
s  k i n d of  
condition. It was wrong. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnachtor Night of  theBroken Glass took place November
 
9 t h r ou gh  10 ,  
1939.  Som etim earound Kristallnacht yourfam ily f ledBerlinfor Belgium . But justprior to that 

your f atherhad taken your two siblings with hi m  to 
Aachen
, Germ any, but then came back.  
T ell us what you can and what you learned later aboutthe events that led tohim taking your 
two siblings and then returning and then about thefam ily's f light toBelgium.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   
As I understand, shortly before Kristallnacht,af riend of m yf ather was a 

policeman
; h
e cam e to him and told him that terrible things were going to happenand that it 
was absolutely necessary f or usto getout of Germ any
.  S
om y father tookm y brother and
 
sister with him . T hey went to 
Aachen
, a sparesort closeto theborder of  Belgium  and Holland
, 
to
 
be  s m u ggl e d
.  W
e were tobe smuggled into I don't know which one of those countries
,  
one

of  thosetwo countriesthey arrived there. They went
 
--
 
it  wa s  a ll
 
arranged. There was goi ng to 
be a smuggler.  
 
 
Unfortunately there were m any other German Jews who wanted 
to leave,and they wanted to leave im mediately
.  S
o there was a group of about 40.  Allof  this I 
learnedf rom  m y brother.  They weren't prepared.  They had to wal k through theforest of the 
wom en inhigh heels, babies were crying.  T hey were ver y obvio
us, too, because they were 
we l l
-
dressed
; n
ot likethe kind of people whowould go f ora long wal k in the woods
.  S o
 
t h e y 
were caught by a Dutch patrol atthe border and they were held andturned over to theGerm an 

authorities.
 
 
T henm y father was put in jail, theother adults, too
.  M
y brother 
and sister were placed with Jewish f am ilies in 
Aachen
. Afew weeks  later the police calledm y 
m other in Berlin 
andasked her if  she knew where her husband was.  She said, 
ﬁO
f  cou rse  I 
know
.  H
e's in 
Aachen
 
with our children.
ﬂ
  
Som ehow m y f ather,brother, and sister were lucky 
because theauthorities were convinced that they were there on vacation.  And they let the
m 
go .
 
 
T hey cam e back toBerlin and then m yf atherwent back to the 
borderby him self . And this tim ehe succeeded in getting intoBelgium .  T hen he arranged for 

us to come over laterwith the Belgian who lived by the border andworked in Germany.  He 
c o mm
uted back and f orth 
a nd
 
brought usacross the border inhis car.
 
 
Again, we were lucky b ecause Hitler happened tobe giving a 
speech when we arrive d at the border, so theGerm an border guards were not interested.

T hey were listening to the speech. And I 
heard this f rom  m y brother.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So 
th
e y™ r e
 
not paying attention
 
made it easierf or you get across.
 
>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson: W asn't there an incident with you, as a little guy, playing with the car keys?
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:  
 
Yes.  I was somethinglike 1.  I was 1
.   So
mehow they gave m e the keys 
or I got the keys.  And when it came tim eto go, they couldn'tf ind the keys to the car.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Butf ortunately they did.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hey did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So atthe borders they were able to get through. Sothattook them  into 
B e lgiu m .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  My f ather had already settled in Antwerp,f ound a place to livef or 

us.  So we lived there in Antwerp,1938. So it was bef ore the war. My brother and sister both 
went to school there. W e were illegal but we were allowed to stay. Butmy father was not 
allowed to work.  Sohe was invol ved in the black m arket, changeof currency, thedollar and 
the British pound.  So he traded,f or instance.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  And that was how basically you survived, by doing that. I think you toldme he 

also may have been invol ved with black m arket with diamonds and things like that to beable to 
m a k e a  livin g.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Antwerp is a center where they cut the diamonds, cleaned the 

diamonds.  I know I've seenthe little packages of  diamonds around.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we go on, Harry, we' ve mentioned Kristallnacht.  Tell us what 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
Kristallnacht was. Say a littlebit about that so people know.
 
>> H a
rr y Marko wic z:  Ok.  Kristallnacht wasa nationalprogram  inRussia. T here were various 
t im e s
 
--
 
I say demonstrations.  It was more than that
, a
ttacks against Jewish comm unitiesand 
Jewish stores.  Sometim es they killed people, too
.  A
nd what happened
, 
Kr
istallnacht
,  
wa s  i t 
was organi zed by theNazis all over the country
 t
he night of  November
 
9 and 10.
 
>> Bill Benson:  1938.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  1938.  Andthey attacked andburneddown synagogues and 
demolished, vandalized Jewish businesses,arrested
 
--
 
I'
vef orgotten now, 30,000 or60,000 
Jewish m en,only m en.  They put them  in a concentration camp.  Most of  them were released 

later on the condition that they leave the country within a short period of time
. 
>> Bill Benson:  And literally hundredsof  synagogues burnedall over Austria so Kristallnacht 
or Night of  the BrokenGlass, crystal night.  So you're now, though, in Belgium, living in 
Belgium . In May
 
1940, of  course, the war began inSeptem ber
 
1939when Germ any attacked 
Poland, but in May of 1940, the
 
Germ ans attacked Belgium  and France, Holland, whatthey 
call the low countries.  A few days af ter theGerm ans attacked Belgium , your fam ily f ledfor 
France. Tell us about that tell us what you know aboutthe attack on Belgium andthen the 
decision to get
 
out of  Brussels and head
 
--
 
or Antwerp and headforFrance and what 
happened.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Belgium haddeclared itself  neutral. But the Germ ans didn't respect that. 
France hadbuilt up very powerf ulf ortif ications on their border. Sothe Germ ans chose not to 
attack the French
 w
here the best Frenchfences were located. T hey went throughBelgium

w
hich was easy. 
 
 
W ithindays of  May
 
10, hundredsof  thousands of  Belgian people 
were tr ying to get into France where they thought they would be safe of
 
before this, when 
Poland was invaded by Germ any, England and France declared on Germany.  SoEngland 
sent
 
over several hundred thousand soldiersstationed in France, the

W hen Be l gi u m  wa s  in v a d ed ,  s om e of t h e t r o op s  c am e  i n i n t o Be l g

So on May
 
14, we lef tAntwerp together with four otherfam ilies.T hey arranged to rent a van 
or truck to bring us to the border.W e got to the coast
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you continuef rom there, Harry, when you described this scene, 
literally, as you said, hundreds of thousandsof  peoplef leeing.  My i m ages, what we've seen in 
m ovies
,  
of peoplef leeing destruction som ewhere on every kind of  transport possible.  You 
were in a van.  Is that the scenethat you have in your m ind of whatwas happening as people 

f led? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T his was before
 
--
 
Idon't remem ber that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fromwhat you've been told.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c

>> Bill Benson:  So everybody's tr ying to get to France.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right. W hen we got to

>> Bill Benson: T hatwasn't the plan.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hat wasn't theplan.  I don't know what his reasoning was
.  I
t was also 
hard to drive becausethere were som any peopleon the road walking, horses,bicycles, 
ever ything of so he turned around and lef t us ther
e.
 
 
T henone otherf am ily, the couple whose wedding m y
 
parents 
m et, metand got married, subsequently, wer e with us we were walk ing.  Andthen at som e 
point they bought a four
-
wheel kind of pedaling bus used in various resorts andpiledall of  their 
stuff  on top of  it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likeacart onpedals? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yeah

ndthen theotherf am ily had a little girl, Lisa,m y age.  They put us on 
top. And everybody else pushed and pulleduntil they got to theborder.
 
 
At the border, the French, Belgianand Dutchcitizens but we 
were stateless so they didn't let us in.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdoesthat mean, you were stateless?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  W edidn'thave citizenship.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you hadf led Germ any and there were youweren't recognized as 
Belgian.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   N o .  W e ha
dno citizenship.  No papers.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were considered stateless.
 
>>
 
Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  Som y sister, I rem em ber telling m e, that m y m other was talking

speaking custom  guy, tryin g to convince him  to let us in but he didn't. So we 
m oved backf rom  theborder.  My parents rented a house in a resort town
 
close tothe border.  
I don't know what their plan was.  Iassum ethey were going to try to go back to the borderand 
try another tim e get across.
 
 
Meanwhile, around then, Belgium
 
--
 
we ll,  
K
ing Leopold 
surrendered, without telling the other allies,the British andthe French, sothey had no warning.  
T he Germ ans hadbeen kept back a little bit,but they m oved right in
 a
nd were getting close to 
theborder.  So we stayed at the house, I really don't know how long. 
 

 
T his was atthe time that the British were
 
evacuating their troops 
in Dunkirk. T here's a harbor just acrosstheborderf rom Belgium , in France. T heir ships 

couldn't com e in. T he harborhadbeenbom bed so eventually they got hundreds and 
hundredsof  sm all boats to com e acrossthe channel to pick
 
up these soldiers, English, French, 
f rom  Belgium , Dutch,and take them  to the large Navy ships that weref urther out.

what I rem em ber is lying in theditch next to the road,m y

>> Bill Benson:  Before you go on,I wanted to ask you earlier, one of the reasonsf orbeing in 

theditch is yo
u had been strafed by Germ an planes.

an off icer. And he was looking

he was tall.  I was lying in theditch.  He was probably 
tall, straight. Looking at the sky with binoculars.  Som ehow

the conf idence, a sense of 
security.  I thinka lot of thefeelings thatI had, theemotions, were
 
not m y own.  They came 
f rom m y m other andother adults. 
 
 
So thenIf ellasleep in theditchand when I woke up, this off icer, 
a  B rit is h  of f ic e r
 
--
 
I don't thinkI knew he was British.  I knew thathewas not a threat tous. He 
was gone.  I askedm y m oth

ﬁW
here's the soldier?
ﬂ
  
And she said, 
ﬁT
hey're gone.
ﬂ
  
B e c aus e  
they were being evacuated. 
  
At thatpoint Ifelt m y m other's anxiety
 b
ecause now there was 
nothing betweenus and the Germ ans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So at som e point then thef am ily decides thatthere's no option but to go back.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   R i gh t .   To A nt we rp

wh ere we were li ving.  It m eant walking back the

I want to gobackabout the straf ing. I had noidea what was 
going on
 e
xceptfor what Idescribed. And we never talked about any of  this,m y f am ily, wit h 
anybody else. It's only the lastfew years that I started talking with m y brother
 a
bo u t it.  My 
sister's dead.  My parents aredead. So there's only the two of us. Iaskedhim aboutthat 

scene, that image that I have. Andhe saidhe doesn't rem em ber that.  I said, 
ﬁW
hy would we 
be ina ditch?
ﬂ
  
Som ething was obvious to him .  He said
, ﬁ B
ecausethe Germans were straf ing 
the roads.
ﬂ
  
I sa id, 
ﬁW
hy was he looking up with hisbinoculars?
ﬂ
  
He said,

dogf ights,
ﬂ 
Germanplanesf ighting British planes above us.  But that I don't rem em ber. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now it's back to
 
--
 
back into Belgium .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  On the way, we  got picked up by Germ an trucks who were 
returning em ptyf rom the
 
f ront. I suppose they wanted to get the refugees becausem any 
people were not going back to where they cam ef rom  in Belgium .  Get them off the roads, clear 

the roads. My brother said they fedus. T here was no stores openor anything. T hey ga ve us 
brea
dthat they had.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And took you back.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  And tookus backm ost of  the way to Antwerp.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappenedonce you got backtoAntwerp?  You tried to leave there. So 

now you're back.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   A t  t he  
beginningf or thef irstf ew m onths nothing happened, apparently.  

Life went on. Even som e of thepeople whohad gone into France cam e back into Belgium 
because apparently everything was ok. T heGerm ans weren't going to doanything.  So they 
decided to co
m e back.
 
 
Gradually, the Germ ans started having increased regulations 
concerning Jews.  Jews
 
had to register with a Jewish C
ounc
il. T heGerm ans set up Jewish 
C
ouncils wherever they were to carry out their decreesand to get the Jews them selves todo 
whate
ver they wantedthem  to do.  It was easier than trying to gi ve orders directly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And it was things like, you couldn'town bikes, you couldn't own radios. You, 

of  course, couldn't have cars. Everything wa s restrictedat thatpoint.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
16
 
>> H a r r
y Marko wic z:  Right.  T hey requisitioned all cars. T here were no gas anywhere.  Bikes.  
Just were notallowed to have radios.  My brother said we didn't have one anywa y, so. 
 
 
T hen they started requesting, again,throughthe Jewish 
C
ouncil, 
started 
requesting young able
-
bodiedmen togo to work, which m ade sense, work inf actories, 
farm s,because som any Germ ans were in the Arm y.  So som epeople went.  At thef irstbatch 
they even wrote hom eever ything was f ine. Thenthey cam eback.My f ather was convoked to 
go to work.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Forced labor.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Forced labor.  Yes. And thenf irstbatch did work on thefactories. Then 
af ter that they worked on thefortif ications that the Germ ans were building on the French coast, 
building 
bunkers. Those were never heardf rom again. 
 
 
My f ather refused to go.  He didn't show upat the time thathe 
was supposed to report.  My m other went toBrussels
 
--
 
Belgium  was ver y sm all.  Antwerp and 
Brussels are one hour apart by train
, p
robably less t
oday.  She f ound an apartm ent. W e 
im mediately m oved into Brussels.
 
 
My parents didn't speak French. But m y mother got out of the 
train stationand heardYiddish spoken. So inno tim e shehad an apartm entfor us. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here were only, I think you told me, just afew comm unities in Belgium  that 

Jews were allowed to live at this point.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Brussels, Antwerp. T he largest cities.  Most Jews lived in 

Antwerp. T he next was Brussels.

17
 
>> Bill Benson:  So your m om f in
ds
 
a placefor you, and you all move there now, in Brussels.  
W hat was that period like f or you? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T he Germ ans still wer e only, atthis point, taking able
-
bodied m en.  T hey 
weren't doing anything about wom en, youngwom en. Som y brother and sister went backto 
school. My f ather went backtobusiness. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Black m arket, Iassum e. Yeah.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  And I stayedhom e with m y mother.  Until 1942, thebeginning of 1942, 
January
 
1942.  T he Germ ans had a high
-
level  conference at which they decided on the 
ﬁ
f ina l 
solution,
ﬂ 
when you go through the Museum ,them ain exhibit. T here were 15 top 
adm inistrators got together
.  
I think eight or10 had 
P h .D. ™s
, which tells you something about 
who was in vol ved at the top of the movem ent.
  
They decidedon the"f inal solution."  Probably 
just rubber stam ped itbecause itprobably wa s decided bef ore that they were going to kill all 
the Jews.  
 
 
So them eetings toplan how all of this was going to takeplace. 
Eichmann, who was in charge, cam e with men who planned the transportation, trains, taking 

Jews to Poland, was there
, w
as one of them .
  
So shortly af ter that, things got
 
--
 
changed.  In 
Belgium  Jews had to wear the yellow star.  Inother countries it started earlier. There were 

re st rict io n s.  
>> Bill Benson:  And then roundupsbegan, right?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  In August 1942, theGermans rounded up Jews at night, they 
would com e atnight, surround the areas thatwere predom inantly Jewish.  T here were no 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
18
 
gh e tto s, p
er se, but neighborhoods where a lot of  Jews li ved, surrounded.  
 
 
In Antwerp they had the cooperationof  thepolice.  They picked 
ever ybody up. T hey had theaddresses because you hadto register.  And they just cam eto 
the houses, apartm ents, knew exactl
y where to go
 a
nd tookeverybody awa y
:  
old people, 
young people, sick people, everybody
; h
appenedtwice, at the endofAugust.  
 
 
T he word got backtoBrussels.  So at thatpoint we stopped 
sleeping in our apartmentbecausethey would com eat night in Antwerp.  During the daym y 

m other andI were in the apartment.  But thenat night we slept
 
--
 
m y m other hada brotherwho 
lived nearby butoutside of the Jewish area.Some of us sleptthere.  Others slept with f riends.  

W ho were living in the 
non
-Je wish  
neighborhoods.
 
 
At the beginning of  Septem berthere was thebig raid in 
Brussels. T hey did the same thing as they did in Antwerp, took everybody away. W e were 
lucky because we were not at hom e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that's when I think precipitated your parents really m aking the very serious 

decision, now you really needed to go intohiding.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Besides the off icial Jewish 
C
ouncil, there was also an 
underground Jewish
-
Belgian organization which actually f ought theoff icial organization
 
of the 
Je wish  C
ouncil. T heyadvised peopleto go intohiding, to hide thechildren separately
, 
wh
erever they could. 
 
 
I shouldm entionthat in Belgium, 90% of theJews were not 
citizens.  Only 6,000 Jews were actual citizens. T he rest were all illegals like we were.  They 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
were easy targets becauseobviously they didn't know the 
l
anguage well.  But children, you 
learn language very quickly.  Children could pass. 
 
 
T hef irst place we went, m y parents placedus, was all threeof  
us together,m y brother andm y sister and I,with an elderly couple. Did itf or them oney. My 
parents asked them  tom ove out of that Jewish
 
--
 
they were neighbors, nearby neighbors.  
T hey paid them  to move to another neighborhood where they wouldn't be known and could 

pass us off as their grandchildren.  So that'swhat happened. But itwas not the best situation. 
 
For one thing, their 18
-
year
-
old grandson was livin g with them .
 
>> Bill Benson: W here they placed you, inthe sam ehouse.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  In the sam ehouse. And 
he
 
--
 
in Belgium , likein other countries, there 
were nationalistorganizations, Nazi type of organizations.  And he joined.  They became 
soldiers in the German Arm y.  Their unif orm swere black.  I rem em ber. 
  
So it was not ideal 
because probably wouldn't have turned inhisgrandparents, but still. 
 
 
T hen theother thing was
 
--
 
oh,m y brother said he joined just to 
have a job.  He was not interested in ideology.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So m ight nothave beena realf ascistbutnonetheless belongs to their 
organization.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Most of them  were shipped tothe easternf ront and were killed 

there.T he other thing is, this couplem ovedback totheir old apartment becausethey didn't 
like thenew area where they were li vin g.  Sothat imm ediately
 
--
 
m y m other gotus out of there.
 
 
Next, I was with m y sister in a children'shome in the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

20
 
countryside.  I don'texactly know what the situation was there, butm y m other cam e to visit.  
W efoundoutthere were Jewish adultshidden there. So that was not ideal because Jewish 
adults were moreeasily identif ied. 
 
 
My m other took us away from  there. I think Istayed with m y 
parentsf ora while.  I should mention,m y parents lived in thehousetheir parents
 
--
 
had been 
vacant.  Neighbors brought f ood, brought it to them , also m ail
f
rom  us when we wrote.  Soour 
parents would write to this one couple. T hey would takem y parents' letters to usalso,and 
m a i l  t hem .
  
My father didn't go out for two years.  My m oth
er did occasionally.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Staying in this hom e thatforall practical purposeswas perceived to be 

vacant. 
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   R
ight.  You know about the Anne F
ran k f am ily.   S im ila r s it u a t ion .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And where did you
 
--
 
you endedup with anotherf am ily.  T ell us.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hat was the Vanderlindenfam ily.  You saw Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden in one of 
thepictures.T hey took in my sister and I, since I was little
, t
ogetherwith m y sister.  T hey li ved 
on theborderof  Brussels.  It was a wholearea builtfor working class people,by the city.  
 
 
W hat Ididn't know is that m y brother was also living there
; n
o t 
ver y f ar, but they didn't tell me because they were af raid if I told anybody else.
  
My sist e r kn e w 
we were som e som ewhere butdidn't know where.  Only m y brotherknew where we were 
which was im portantbecause of what happened.  
 
 
T he Gestapo went to the house where m y brother was living.  
T here were two other Jewish kids there.T heGestapo spoke tom y brother and the other ki
d s 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

21
 
in German. T hey said, 
ﬁO
h, you're the Jewish kids.
ﬂ
  
T hey knew ahead of time. But they didn't 
com ef or them . They were looking f or the son of thef am ily, an adult son, who was work ing f or 
the Germanson the railroad yard.  He was a railroadm an.  He wasworkin g in the railroadyard 
in Germany.  Heandothers had gotten leaveto go homef orf ive days.  It tookthem three days 
to get home because the trains weren't running the way they norm ally are.  So their return 
back late
.  
 
 
T here h
ad been a raid o
n  
--
 
an alliedbom bing raid on the 
railroad yard.  So they suspectedthat one of the Belgians had given informationtotheallies.
  
So they came to the house, searchedeveryt hing for a radio transm itter. They didn't know that 

a t the  tim e  th a t th is stuff w
as therebut later they f ound out. T hat's what they were looking for.  
T hey would look behind pictures on the wall, ever ywhere.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So forthem om ent they lef t your brother alone.
 
>> H a r r y 
Marko wic z:  Yeah. T hey said, "W
e'll com e back for yo
u tom orrow." W ell, m y brother 
didn't wait. 
  
Sohe cam eover to where we were, and we got out of there.  
 
 
T hen I was back with m y parentsf or a while.  My sister and 
brother, I think they we re staying in a com mercial laundry, behindadirty laundry bag, 
keeping 
o u t of  sigh t. 
  
My m other asked the Vanderlindenfam ily to m ove right into Brussels.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hef am ily that you had just been with?
 
>> Ha rr y Ma rk o wic z:   Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. 
 
>>
 
Harr y Marko wic z:  So they did. They m oved into Brussels where people didn't know them .  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

22
 
It was a big city.  So I couldpassfor their son.  And alm ostanadult daughter. I'm not quite 
sure how old she was. She wasm aybe 18.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bothduring
 
the tim e you were with the Vanderlindens when they li ved
 
--
 
were 
out in the country but also once they m oved back into the city, they were a Catholicfam ily.  Am 
I righ t?
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .  
 

>> Bill Benson:  And you were hidden
 
--
 
Im ean, you were hidden in thehom e. W hat was your 
lif e like there, to your knowledge?  You actually, I think, went to schoolf or aperiod
,  
to a 
Catholic school? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  T hey were Catholic like m ost Belgiansbut they were not 

practicing Catholics. They did send m e to a school that was Catholic.  Instructors were nuns.  
W e were taken to church.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you adopt thef am ily name?
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   O
h, yes.  I was Henry Vanderlinden.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you had to really learn tobe able
 
to answer question as though you were 
their child.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  It was a littlem ore com plicated. Because thisarea was 
F l e mis h
 
speaking. I didn't know it. W hen we lived in Antwerp, I wasn't going to school.  I was too 
young.  Stayed home
 
with m y m other. So only some of the nuns spoke French. Butthe kids 
didn't. And Ididn't know what was going on
 i
n  cla ss. I gu e ss itd id n't m atte r. 
 
 
Eventually there was an altarboy who spoketom e in French.  I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
23
 
don't remember how this cam e about.  Hetold m e I was Jewish.  I don't know how hefound 
out,but he told me. Then he introduced me to other kids.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So there were others inthe school.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  About adozen. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  About a dozen. 
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   I
 
guess
 
--
 
we lef tthat area.  You askedm eabout theVanderlindens.  
T hey were ver y good to me.  Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden, she was an extremely loving m other. I had a 
hard tim eatf irstbecause I couldn't stand thefood. T here was nofood
, b
ut what we had to ea
t 
was ver y lim ited, roots, vegetables.  Forprotein we hadbesides the rabbits that 

Mr.
 
Vanderlinden raised, only had so many rabbits,but it was lard.  It m ade m e choke justto 
try to eat it.  I couldn'teat it.  So Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden would cut it up in tiny, tiny pieces andmix it 
up with the mashed potatoes. Andthen shewould fee
d  
me .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was theprotein source.  So you were ableto then live with the 

Vanderlindens in Brussels itself  inhiding again. W hat can you tell us about that period? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  W ell, I was hidden in a wa y but I could gooutside.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you were their sonasf ar as the outside world knew.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  So I didnorm al things with them .  Already m entioned, som etim es I 

h
ad to go back to m y parents before because
 
--
 
I don't know wh y.  But I spent time with m y 
parents where I couldn't go out. T he windows  were covered with newspapers.  That was a 

sign that it was a vacant building.  And therewas a little holethatmy father made I could look 
through theholeto look up on the street.  But I couldn'tplay outside.  I couldn't gooutside.

W hen I was with m y mother, som etim es in public, not very of ten, 
we didn't talk. One time we were on the street car.  I don't know whe re we were going.  T wo 
Germ an soldiers got on infront.W e were inthebackof  the car. T hey use
d 
to go through the 
car and askeverybody for identif ication papers
, w
hich would have indicated that we were 
Jewish.  Som y reaction, Idon't know, I didn'tfeel anything, butI knew my mother was panicky.  
And we got off at the next stop. And that night I hada nightm are involving the Germ ans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Go ahead.  I'm  sorry.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I just want to contrast,being with m y parentsandbeing with the 
Vanderlindens. W iththem it was normal. W e were in the street.  Icould speakopenly.  W ith 
m y parents, with m y mother, it was scary.  Not that I was scared becauseI don't rem em ber 
being scared, but I knew that it was dangerous.  I couldfeel itf
rom m y m other. 
 
 
Also,m y m other was m uch more reservedperson.  
Mrs .
 
Vanderlinden played with me, hide and seek andall kindsof  things.  She was a very 
warm  person. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you would continue inthese circum stances until 1944. T ellus about the 
period that ledupto liberationand what liberation, what that meantfor you and meantf or your 
parents and your brother and sister. Tell us about that tim e. 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Bef ore we knew that the allies were com ing, one day my mother showed
 

up and said she was taking m e home. She called it home. But shewas taking me to where 
she andm y father were staying.  It was kindof  a shock
f
o r bo t h  Mrs.
 
Vanderlindenand m yself.  
My m other said, well, af ter the liberation you can com e back and stay with the Vanderlindens

again.  So she tookm e.
 
 
W e were on a street car.  All of a sudden she whispered tom e
 
--
 
because we spoke Germ an.  
ﬁ
Look out the wi ndow.
ﬂ
  
There was a sm all Germ an truck.  In 
f ront there was ahorse pulling thetruck. It ran out of
 
gas or brokendown.  I don't know.  And 
on topof  the truck there was a Germ an soldier lying on his stom achwith a heavy m achine 
gun, but he was acting strange.  He kept looking around, up at the buildings.  And m y mother 
said, "They're runningaway.  T he
 
Germ ans are running away.
ﬂ
  
W on't everf orget that. 
 
 
So she broughtm e towhere m y f ather was. By that tim e you 
couldhear thebom bing getting closer.  Everybody was kind of  waiting for the allies to arrive.  
T hey liberatedBrussels Septem ber
 
3. The Germ ans lef t.  My parents expected that there 
would be abattle
;  
thatthe Germans would not give up.  I learned this later.  My m other said, 
ﬁW
ell, if  we're going tobe killed in the bombing, we m ight as well die together.
ﬂ 
>> Bill Benson:  So she brought everybody together?
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Yes.  She couldn't getm y brotherand sister because by then they were 
living f ar away.  Only way to get there was by train.  And it was diff icult and especially 
dangerous f or m y parents, for m y mother. 
 
 
So the next day
 
--
 
theBritish arrived that night, in theevening.  
T he next m orningm y m other tookm e.  Ididn't know
 
where at the tim e.  Iasked, "W
hat
 
abo u t  
m y f ather?"  She said, "He's not ready to go out.  He hasn't been out for two years."   Can'tface 
people, 
something likethat.  I don't rem em ber theexact words. 
 
 
So as we were going
 
--
 
I knew I guess we wer e going to a park.

T here were m ore andm orepeople in the street going the sam edirection I didn't know what, 
wh y. W e were in the street where there was
 
a tank onf ire. I was fascinated.  It was probably 
a Germ an tank.  I'm not sure. I assume it was a Germ an tank. Someone had thrown a 

Molotov cocktail on it. 
 
 
So I'm  standing by the tank watching andm y m other said, 
ﬁC
om eon, you gotto go.
ﬂ
  
She grabb

thousands of people were there.  My world changed.

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  I m ay have to stop. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yes.  T ake your time. 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  So there were all of these happy people cheering the soldiers.  My 
m other tookm etoa tank where there was one soldier standing onthe tank.W e lookedat 
eachother.  But we didn't have a com mon language.  I think he bentdown and stretchedout 
his arm s.  My m other lif ted m e up.  Heheld me in hisarm s. 
 
 
I don't think I can continue.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
No. That was liberation.  That was liberation.  Of course, your brother and

you would go back tothe Vanderlindens

>> Harr y Marko wic z:  Right.  Asf aras I rem em ber, I didn't know how long I stayed there. I 

thought it was just a short time. But readingm oreabouthistory and putting things together, I 
realized I stayedm uch longer than Iexpected.  
 
 
Right after liberationeverybody hung up 
f la g s
,  t h e a llie s ,  
Am erican, British, French, Belgianf lags thatwere si ze of double sheets.  I don't know where 
they got thef lags, how they m adethem , obviously in secret,butI have no idea. They wer e 
hanging down thef acades of the houses.  And one day I noticed nof lags. All the color was 
gone.  It was pretty obvious.  So Iasked Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden, "
W
here are thef lags
?"   At th is

point shetoldm e.  She sounded scared.  She said the Germansm ight com eback.  Later I 
realized that was the 
B
attle of  the 
B
u l ge
, w
hich was in Decem ber, Christm astim e, justbefore 
Ch ris t m a s .  
 
 
So we were liberated in Septem ber, September
 
3 .  
And the year 
I was still li ving with the Vanderlindensaf ter the liberationfor all of thesem onths.  Iaskedm y 

brother recently why.  I  don't know.  He saidm aybe becausem y parents' apartm ent was very 
sm all, with like three room s,and they didn'thave any furniture. Also, they took ina cousinof  
m ine.  My m other's brother andhis wif e andtheir son were deported on the last transportf rom  
Belgium . So their daughter was with herself ,a little older thanI am . They tookher in.  So 
there was not enough
 
room.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were in a saf e place.
 
>> H a rr y Mark o wi c z:   Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we close, Harry, tell us a little
 
--
 
the Vanderlindens, they took youand 
your sister in when they lived on the outskirtsof  town.  Yourm otheraskedthem  to relocate 
into Brussels to protect you. T hey did that
, w
hich meant that when they went into Brussels
 
--
 
because you toldm ethey hadto getnew occupations,new jobs. There clearly had tobe 

signif icant risk to them for doing this. W hat do you think motivated the Vanderlindens to do all 
of  t ha t ? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  You know, we never talked about it.  Many ye ars later, Arlene, m y wi fe 

andI were visiting. We used to live in Paris.W e visited theVanderlindens in Brussels.  By 
thattim e he had died,but. Arlene did what I never did. She asked"
H
ow com e?"  The

explanation was kind o
f  s im p le .  " S
om ebody knocked at the door and asked would you takein 
a child."  T hey didn't say whether it was a Jewish child or anything.  But Mrs.
 
Vanderlinden 
a ssu m
ed.  
 
 
I should say thatm any Belgians, unlike othercountries, were 
ver y help if many to the Jews
 a
nd took risks
; n
ot the same risk that they would have taken in 
Poland. Poland helping Jews was an im mediateexecution
, i
ncluding the wholef am ily, and the 
neighborhood visiting, too. InBelgium I don'tthink they did that.  I think they m ighthave sent 
them  to concentration cam ps. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Last questionf or you, Harry.  At what point was thefam ily completely reunited 

and stayed that way?  I know your brotherand sister would leavef irst to go to the United 
States.  Butat what point did you really were all back together? 
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  In 1951. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  1951.
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  But that didn't lastbecauseas soonas we arri ved, my brother was 

d r af t ed
 a
nd sent to Korea. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e're at the endof our program .  I'm  sorry we didn't get a chancef or youask 

som e questions and there's many m ore that Iwanted to ask. So we'll have todoanother 
version, I think.
 
 
Harry, when
 
he'sf inished,he's going to stepdown off  the stage.  
If anybody would like to meethim or askhim a question, pleaseabsolutely feelf ree to do that.
 
I'm  going toturnback to Harry to close our program  ina moment.

I want to thank all of you for being with us.  I rem ind you that

It's

that our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
ge t s  t he  
last word.  Soonthat note, I'm  going to turn back to Harry to close our program .
 
>> Harr y Marko wic z:  T hank you. Som e people ask, 
ﬁW
hydidn't the Jews resist? W hy did 
they go to their death like sheep?
ﬂ
  
W ell inf act, Jews resisted inevery possible way that they 
ca n
, t
hey could
; e
veryt hing f rom em igrating as soon as the Nazis took over to crossing 
boarders illegally when it was no longer to doit any other way, b y hiding, bypassing f or 
Ch ris
tians, by giving awa y their children to strangers to help theodds that they would survive, 
by f ighting back, underground, by sabotage. T he Germ ans hadm ade some concentration 

cam ps work in weapons factories, being m aking bullets,for example. T here was 
sabotage 
going on, putting sand in the bullets along wit h the powder, things like that
; a
nd also rebellions
 
i
n ghettos and in the concentration cam ps. Thatdoesn't sound to me like going to their death 
like sheep. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Harry.
