Question: This is the United States Holoca
ust Memorial Museum interview with Lore 

Schore.   
Answer: No.
 
Q: Could you pronounce  
 
A: Lore Schore.  And when I was a child in
 Berlin, it was Lubben 
Lichtenstein.  Okay. 
 
Q: Thank you.  So with Lore Schore  
 
A: Lore Schore. 
 
Q: Lore.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  
Lore Schore, conducted by Ag
nieszka McClure, on October 
17th, 2010, at the Kinderstransport Associati
on Conference, in Arlington, Virginia.  I'm 

sorry again about misp
ronouncin g your name. 
 
A: That's why I tell people.  No body 
knows how.  I tell them.  All right.
 
Q: Very good.  
 
A: By th e way, in case you want to know
, Schore is a Hebrew word.  It mean s ox. 
 
Q: It means ox, okay.  
 
A: That's my husband's name, of course. 
 
Q: And your maiden name was Lichtenstein?  
 
A: Lichtenstein, in German, yes.  
 
Q: Where in  Germany are you from?  
 
A: Berlin. 
 
Q: From Berlin.  Can you tell us a little bit 
about your childhood in Berlin?  How much 
you remember  
 
A: I remember almost everything from th
en and th en later on it gets vague.  
 
Q: The microphone was clipped to your jacket.  
 
A: Where do you want me to put it?  
 
Q: Maybe on your shirt, if you don't mind, so 
you can clip it to your shirt.  All those 
technical things.  Sorry.  
 

A: Technical problems.
 
Q: Let me do that.  I will put it 
on your collar.  That 
is probably going to
 be the best place 
because it's out of the way.
 So you mentioned that you 
were raised in Berlin?  
 
A: In a nice, comfortable middleclass family.  
My  I have no sisters or brothers.  I'm an 
only child.  I don't even have a first cousin
.  And to ju mp  ahead, I now have eight 
greatgrandchildren, which is mo re than mo st
 people can say, I think.  And I may have 
more because I still have one grandc
hild who is not attached yet. 
Q: I see. 
A: Okay.  I grew up in this comf
ortable home with a kinderfraulein. 
 
Q: That means the nurse? 
 
A: Nanny.  They were not always nice, t
hose kinderfraulein, but we were always 
comfortable.  And I went to kindergarten and to
 elementary school there, and I  my father 
died wh en  I was three.  So my  grandfathe
r was a male p resence in my family, and I 
adored  him, and he was a l
ovely man, and my  mo ther was a very young widow and had 
her own problems. And I went 
on to a Jewish school after leaving elementary school 
because they were there.  
And by that time, w e moved to
 the area called Grunewald on 
the Roseneck, which is quite a smart area in Be
rlin.  And I stayed th
ere. And then, at the 
very end, by that time I was over 14, they
 stuck me in an art school because I was 
extremely talented, they tell me, b u t I never go
t anywhere with that.  I did some posters 
later on. Anyhow, by the time th
e socalled Kristallnacht, whic
h wasn't called that in 
Berlin, you understand.  That was put on to  
that episode by th e American press, that 
expression. 
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: And, anyhow, I remember where we liv
ed, there was one Jewish jeweller on the 
corner at the Rosenach, and they  had forgo
tten  it was supposed to  be a spontaneous 
uprising. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Except they forgot that one store.  Th
ey came the next day and bashed it up.  
 
Q: I see.
 
A: So that was that.  And I was comfortabl
e.  We took summer holidays in interesting 
places.  The Baltic.  A nd dances where my gra
ndfather's family came from.  We went to 
Sarkot and stayed  and went swimming.
  It was a peaceful, pleasant time.  
 
And then , of course, again, after this, you k
now wh at happened , my  
mo ther rushed ab out 
getting me onto a Kindertrans
port, and she succeeded. 
 

Q: How old were you when  that happened?  
 
A: 15.  I was one of the older children.  Righ
t now, I am one of the oldest ladies here, I 
think, by far. 
 
Q: Well, and it doesn't show at all.  
 
A: Good for you.  Thank you.  But I am. 
 And wh en we went swimming last summer, my  
son and I, in the Atlantic, he kept on tellin
g me, Don't swim out so far.  Remember, 
you're 36  86andahalf, which 
he rubbed it in a little bit. 
 
Q: That's a good problem to 
have, not to swim out to  
 
A: I'm here, and I'm fairly we
ll.  And I had a little lumpectomy
, which ladies get, but you 
know that. Okay.  In the m
eantime, they sent me off in
 Berlin in May of '39. 
 
Q: So, ju st to come back a little b it more to
 your background in Be
rlin.  So, you come 
from a mid d leclass, fairly welloff family.  Y
ou attended mo st of your schools in Berlin, 
then, right?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you are the only child.  And you are 
very in touch with your grandfather?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And not so mu ch  
 
A: My mother was a little bit di
fficult, but this is really too 
long.  You don't want to go 
into all that. But anyhow, she 
took me to the station where we were leaving, and I was 
very happy talking to  a school  
fellow school girl that had gone 
to the same classes I did.  
We were talking, and my mother all of a s
udden started yelling th at 
I had to go and sit 
next to her because she finally 
got emotionally involved in th
is departure. Okay.  We got 
on th e train.  On the next station, my  aunt
, whom I loved very  mu ch too, was there to 
wave goodbye to me.  She was eventually  
she lived in France, 
and the French police 
addressed  arrested her and sent her 
to Auschwitz where 
she was murdered Œ 
 
Q: I see.  
 
A:  in the '40s.  Okay.  Then 
I was  got to London. First, we
 went by boat to  from  where 
did we leave from?  To Harw
ich from Hook Von Holland, I think, and then to  Harwich, 
and then  by train to London
, Euston Station, I think. 
 
Q: And were you  you seem
ed to be happy to be on the train, or am I  
 
A: I was not miserable. 
 
Q: Not miserable.  
 

A: And there was lots of young pe
ople, and we sang songs on th e trip. 
 
Q: And you weren't  did you  
 
A: I was not afraid.  I was not petrified.  
I had  they said peop
le should come with 
woolsack.  Everybody else had suitcases.  I 
had a woolsack because my  mo ther followed 
the rules. Okay.  In 
London I was picked up by a lady 
who ran a girl school in East 
Molesey in Surrey. 
 
Q: Oh, the county, right?  
 
A: Yes.  And so  she picked me up.  And I ha
d English, I had English for a couple of years 
and I had French mo re, but that didn't do me a
ny good there.  And then she took me to 
this East Molesey girl school.  It was called 
Mildred's Lodge.  And one
 of the ladies here 
was there as well, and I remembered her.  She 
didn't rememb er me, but
 that can happen.  
 
So we were there, I would say, for quite  
six months, I would th ink, something like that, 
and I was sent to an art school in  somewhere 
near there.  I can't rememb er the name now 
of the town. 
 
Q: So th ey apparently  thought 
you were talented as well?  
 
A: I was talented, but then, you 
know, if you don't make use of
 it, it fades.  Anyhow, they 
were  there was  the school had a dance or 
something, and one of the boys afterwards 
called me, and that was a great scandal. 
 An d the lady who had lo oked  from Germany 

who had looked after 
us  not looked after us, 
but promoted th
e whole thing, she said stay 
away from men.  They only want one thing.  
You know, the whole routin e.  Before your 
time, thank God. Anyhow, I thi
nk I was  after spending holiday in  Devonshire, or was it  
I don't rememb er now.  Mrs. Atkinson, who 
was a marv elous Quaker lady, who walked 
around with  what is that called?  
 
Q: I don't know.  
 
A: In German, it's schnecke. 
 
Q: Oh, like little buns?  She had little   
 
A: Snails.  She wore silver buckles on her sh
oe, and sh e had a lovely house in the country  
and many sons, and they had a ba
dger in a garage or in a barn.  It was fairly interesting, 
and I liked it there.  So we ha
d a holiday there.  Then after 
that, I think th ey didn't want 
me in that school anymore. 
 
Q: Because of the dance?  
 
A: Because of that boy's phone call.  Big 
deal.  But it was a different time, and those 
people were different people. 
 

Q: Right.  
 
A :  O k ay .  T h en  th ey  stu c
k me somewhere in Hamp shire with an old lady and her 
daughter.  They  had seven cats.  And they  di
dn't order much milk.  It was a to wer that 
had been built by Pitt, I th
ink, against Napoleon, the expected invasion. 
 
Q: Mmh mm.  
 
A: And it was three stories, one on top of the 
other.  It wasn 't very wonderful.  There was 
no indoor plumbing.  But it was s till summer, so it was all right. 
 After awhile, that didn't  
seem to be a solution.  And they  stuck me
 with a vicar in a town called Lockerley. 
 
Q: Why did they move you to th e vicar?  
 
A: Who knows.  I wasn
't always consulted. 
 
Q: I see.  It seemed that 
you didn't really bond with those people that you stayed with, 
right?  
 
A: Never, no.  And the people that  the lady th
ere, the vicaress, if 
there is such a word, 
there isn't, but the lady, she had four daug
hters, and her husband was not allowed to 
smoke in the house, which was good.  He smoke
d a pipe.  His sermons 
were very poor.  I 
had enough English by then, but I 
went to the sermons.  I went
 to church when they had 
services because it was the only entertainmen
t then. After that, so
mehow  was it a joint 
committee who used to transfer pe
ople?  You don 't know about that. 
 
Q: Yeah, that is somewhat 
obscure, but I think that's   
 
A: It's in London.  And they moved me 
on to North Hamp ton where I got stuck for 
awhile longer, and there was a curate who took
 me in.  Curate is an assistant vicar.  
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: And she was a very glamorous lady, and he
 was a very sweet man.  Their name was 
Evan s.  I rememb er that.  A
nd so I stayed with them, agai
n being sent to art school.  I 
don't think it really knocked in, 
you know, kicked in at all. 
 
Q: It didn't?  
 
A: No, I don't think so.  But anyhow, 
it was all right.  It was tiresome.  
 
Among the other interesting thin
gs, this may interest you, your
 group, there was a rabbi.  
And because in  in North Hamp ton.  And he
 wore a clerical collar.  I don't know if 
anybody else ever told you that
, but it is a very unusual thing 
for a rabbi to do, but he said 
the other clergyman, they wore a 
clerical collar, so he did too.  This was an edification on 
his part. 
 

Q: I see.  T h at is actually pretty unusual.  
 
A: Mighty unusual. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: So  okay.  So I spent some
 time there.  And then
 my mother kept ru
nning to London to 
the America  she was  by that 
time she had co me to England. 
 
Q: How did she manage to do th at?  
 
A: Domestic VISA.  
 
Q: So sh e was probably one of the 
early people who managed to get on  
 
A: She came very late, just
 before the war started. 
 
Q: Oh, really?  
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And you came on the first  wa
s it one of the first transports
?   Was it still in winter?  
 
A: Oh, no.  In May.  The first one st
arted in, I think, November or December. 
 
Q: I think it was somewhere around that time.  
 
A: Yeah.  So, anyway, my mo
ther kept going to London to  the American Embassy.  And 
somehow  I don't know how that all worked  out,
 but th ey found out that when  I was born, 
my father was an American citizen.  He had liv
ed in America for 25 or 
so years.  He went 
back to Germany to visit relatives after Wo
rld War I, met my mother in  doesn 't matter 
where  Quebec. 
 
Q: Was he also  
 
A: And they got married. 
 
Q: Was he also Jewish or not?  
 
A: Oh, yes, yes. 
 
Q: He was? 
 
A: Yes.  And, ag ain, my moth
er was cute, and he was a nice
 man, and I think she wanted 
to be on the only girl on the block to be married
 to an American.  I'm 
pretty sure that was  
anyhow, they were married.  I was born 10 m
onths later.  And, again, my  father died 
when I was three, which was not a  really terr
ible, you know.  Anyhow, so after that  now 
we're jumping back.  
I'm sorry.  I'm not go
ing chronologically. 
 
Q: That's o k ay.  But at 
least we are coming back.  
 

A: In the meantime, th e American Embassy
 found out.  There 
was a new law on th e 
books, the Nationality Act of 1940, and that  
because when I was born, my father was an 
American citizen, I could be an American citizen.  
 
Q: Well, that was a good th ing at the time.  
 
A: It was very interesting.  It was  I was give
n a passport, but only if I left England.  So  a 
cousin and uncle took me to th
e railroad station.  I went to Wales.  I took a ferry from 
Wales to Dublin. 
 
Q: Mmh mm.  
 
A: I went by train from Dublin to Galway. 
 
Q: And where is that?  
 
A: In Ireland. 
 
Q: In Ireland, mmhmm.  
 
A: Far western Ireland.  And there was a ship 
leaving for the U.S.  and I can't remember 
the name.  It may have been Wash ington or 
 I don't remember.  An
d they were full of 
Americans who were going to Am
erica, but they were only 
just Americans.  M any were 
born there, and then  the parents moved back  to
 Europe or whatever.  And some of them 

were Americans who were on summer holiday.  
Now, the war had started.  They were 
insane.  And the ship I went 
on to finally was stopped by a 
German submarine already off 
the coast of Spain or Portugal, 
I think.  So, anyhow, we got 
there.  They had covered up 
the swimmi ng pool with  planks and put cots 
on there for all these 
people to go back to 
America.  
 
Q: So your mother was also
 on the ship with you?  
 
A: My mo th er stayed in England.  And I ha
d great fun on the boat
 after I stopped being 

seasick.  And th ere were many 
young people on it.  And then, 
wh en I got to 
New York, in 
those days, they didn't let young wo men off 
ships because they we
re afraid of white 
slavery. 
 
Q: Oh, yes, mmhmm.  
 
A: Except nobody paid 
any attention to me, and th ere I wa
s standing on the pier in New 
York  and nobody was 
there to meet me. 
 
Q: And who was there supposed to  be?  
 
A: My uncle had been  sent  
he had just come from France, and he was sent a telegram, 
but  wh ich obviously didn't ge
t there.  It was war time  
 

Q: Right.  
 
A:  in England.  That was another thing th at
 was interesting.  From England, I was with 
my  g a s  
 
Q: With your?  
 
A:  gas mask.  And I had to hand it in.  An
d then in Ireland, ever
ything was lit up, which 
made an enormous change after the blackouts of London. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Or No rth Hamp ton or wh er
ever.  Anyhow, nobody was there.  A nd I was 16, and it 
was quite worrisome, you know.  
 
Q: I could only imagine.  
 
A: Yes.  And th en, being new to  New York 
who knows that there are five boroughs and 
five telephone books, so I tried to find my  unc
le and of course he didn't have a phone, I 
will tell you why later, and I did find an aunt, 
cousin of my father's, who had started a 
board ing house.  And she was not surprised to
 hear from me, and she said, "Well, take a 
trolley car, blah, blah, blah."  
I was much too sophisticated.  
I put my luggage in storage, 
and I took a taxi. 
 
Q: And you obviously had mo
ney, then, with you?  
 
A: Enough money fo r that.  And so she  I we
nt to her house, I found it.  And then she 
took me by trolley to my uncle's rooms.  
He was also rooming in  some other boarding 
house.  I mean, these people 
had just gotten here, you know. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And until the day he died, he denied, but he
 looked at me  I was 16 by that time and 

curvy.  When he'd  last seen me, I was 12 
and a skinny little thing, and he clicked his 
heels, and he introduced himself, Schneiderm
ul (ph), that was his name.  He didn't  
recognize me for obvious reasons.  And th en hi
s wife came home, and sh e dealt with the 
situation. They stuck me somew h ere in a ro
om.  And then I was handed on to one of 
these  something of Jewish  Council of Jewish
 Women.  They took a little care of me.  I 
got put into  you know, being 
a nanny or babysitter, whatever 
it was at that time.  I don't 
remember. It was the summer.  It gets very ho
t in New York in the 
summer.  It was a big 
surprise  Washington was worse, I think.  An
d so they stuck me somewhere.  It was all 
right. And th en things get a little vague now. 
 I don't remember ev erything.  But I spent 
time with these people and then somehow the  th
ey sent me to art school again  no, wait a 
minute.  I went to high school 
then for a little bit.  For a yeara
ndahalf or so, I went to high 
school. 
 

Q: Through the association, right?  
 
A: They pushed me into
 it.  But the thing is, I was never a very great student as a child, 
but in New York , I was fabulous.
  I was a very good student. 
 
Q: Well, very good.   
A: I had an education behind me, but that was 
it.  And after that, I think I got, again, as 

my mother used to say, from 
Pontiu s to Pilate, they sent me around.  And I got funny 
things.  I think I started wo rking so mewhere. 
 At Revlon, not for ve
ry long. Eventually I 
found a job at a printing outfit, and there I was a 
stripper.  Haha.  It's not a joke there.  It 
was something you do.  Layouts,
 it was called  stripping.  So I use that because it's really 

amusing. 
 
Q: So I assumed that.  So what were you ex
actly stripping?  Boxes out of lids or what?  
 
A: No.  Stripping is to put  
it was called photo offset printin
g, lithography.  And they did 
something called Goldenrod, an
d the film on which the stuff was printed was cut out and 
that was called stripping. 
 
Q: Stripping.  
 
A: And then they put it on a pre
ss.  Not a letter press, on a circular thing.  And it was run 
on the letter press after that.  And 
my  husbandtobe was work ing there. 
 
Q: So your husband number three, you said?  
 
A: No, not yet. 
 
Q: Oh, to be, you said.  Okay. 
 I'm sorry.  I misheard you.  
 
A: My husbandtobe, and he was 
a very nice fellow, and eventu
ally we got married.  By 
th at time, my  mo th er h a d  co me fro m E ng l and .
  And I think that's about it. We were 
married.  We lived in New York.  We
 got another apartment, which was  
 
Q: There are some gnats here.  
 
A: Flies, whatever, yeah.  We got another apar
tment.  I had two children.  My son's name 
is Robin, and he is now 65, going on 66.  
 
Q: Oh, my goodness.  
 
A: And my daughter is Wendy, and she's also
 married.  She married a boy next door, who 
is Irish and RC.  Do you know what that means?  
 
Q: No, I do not.  
 
A: Roman Catholic. 
 

Q: Roman Catholic, okay.  
 
A: We all lived in Manhattan,
 and then my  son went into the Army  during th e Vietnam 
War.  But he was not shipped for Vietnam, fort unately.  He was leading two trains back 
and fo rth with prisoners and stuff like that, I 
think.  I don't rememb
er now.  And both 
children are married.  My daughter is two y
ears younger than my  son, and they both had 
nice weddings.  
 
Q: That's g o od.  
 
A: My soninlaw's  my  son's fatherinlaw 
was a Viennese, which means nothing because 
we speak different languages. 
 
Q: Almost.  
 
A: Truly.  I won't go into deta
ils.  But he now is round the be
nd and is in assisted living, 
and he's still around, though.  
He's  over 90 by now, 92, but he
's still there. 
 Anyhow, they 
had two girls eventually, and my  daughter ha
d two boys and a girl.  And, again, now I 
have eight greatgrandchildren.  
 
Q: Yeah, that's quite  
 
A: Which is my claim to fame
.  A nd they're all wonderful 
and adorab le and cu te.  And 
they're all little girls except on
e little boy, which is also surprising.  And I think that's 
about the end of the story.  I'm here.  I'm 
coping.  I moved from New York to New Jersey 
six years ago because my childre
n got tired of taking the Cro
ss Bronx Expressway or the  
the  what is the other bridge?  The Verraza
no Bridge.  And now from the Christmas in 
Berlin, I now have Christmas in New Jersey
 and I had it in New York , and everybody 
comes.  The new house is somew h at small,  
so we don't even ha
ve room for all the 
presents, and we have to stretch the walls. 
Q: Well, that's a good problem to have, thou
gh, not enough room for all the presents.  
 
A: A lot of people  by Christmas, I have, lik
e, 1820 people, which 
is a lot for this little 
condo that I live in.  But I live on a patio, there is a patio  outside, and there is a golf 
course.  I left out of my life later, very impor
tant part.  When the children went to school, 

my  husband gave me a present of a pair of re
ally cruddy Japanese binoculars, individual 
focus, really terrible, and 
we were going with friends on 
a Mother's  Day, '36 or so. 
 
Q: Mmh mm.  
 
A: '56, in '56.  
 
Q: '56.  
 
A: And we went on a picnic.  And I used th
e binoculars..  I took 
my children's little 
Golden Guide.  You ma
y not know those, but they were 
lovely little books.  And the first 

two birds I saw were Rosebreasted Grosbe
ak  and a Magnolia Warbler, and I was 
seduced.  I mean, I couldn't ever figure on an
ything better than to go out and look at 
birds.  
 
Q: Really?  
 
A: So that has been my passion.  I'
ve traveled all over the world now. 
 
Q: Watching bird s?  
 
A: Watching birds.  But I also do flowers 
and other  I'm a natura
list now, you know, in 
quotation marks.  Not by training because I  
my  education is painfully neglected, but I 
can read and write, and I can look at
 birds, and I can look th ings up.  
 
And the trips that I've taken,
 I mean, even traveled togeth
er, my  husband and I when  he 
was still well, and then he had 
four primary cancers, and the last years were imp o ssible.  
He was very, very ill. 
 
Q: I'm sorry.  
 
A: Yes.  And it went on.  And after he died
, I started, you know  first I went to Kenya, 
and then  I went to South Afri
ca, and I went all over South 
America and the West Indies, 
and I went to Madagascar and to India and to 
Borneo, Malaysia.  I wa
s in Finland, then  I 
was in Spain and in Egypt. 
 
Q: And all watching birds, right? 
 
A: Almost always, yeah.  It was very exc
iting.  Now I'm getting a little old for that kind 
of crap  excuse me, excuse me.  A nd I  whatev
er I do, there are a little far fewer birds, but 
it's still a p assion for me. And if I  I have a fe
eder  three feeders outside  four feeders.  
And I watch whatever comes in the yard  so
called yard.  And I garden a little n o w.  In 
other wo rds, my  life is okay.  It isn't stimulat
ing where I am.  It's bl
and.  It's a senior 
retirement community. 
 
Q: Well, not everyone's life is extremely st
imulating.  I would say th e majority has a 
normal  have a normal life, right?  
 
A: I don't know.  Other people play bridge, 
tennis, golf.  None of the above.  I don't do 
any of those things.  If I 
don't go birding, I read. 
 
Q: But you swim also.  Yo
u mention th at you swim.  
 
A: I swim what?  
 
Q: You mention that you swim.  
 
A: Did I mention it?  
 

Q: Yeah, you mentioned  you to ld me that your
 son told  you not to 
swim too far away.  
 
A: That's right.  But wher
e I live now, it's too far to go to 
the beach.  I used to go to  Jones 
Beach or Petre Island, Gratiot, and now that
 is too far for me, and I go swimming in the 
pool.  But I still drive and  not at night.  I've
 decided to stop driving 
in the dark.  It's not 
such fun. 
 
Q: That's h arder.  It's not as  the 
visibility isn't as good, right, at night?  
 
A: It's a little bit dangerous, I 
think, for other people too.  
 
Q: I will think about it.  
 
A: You're n o t there yet.  Wait until you're 86andahalf.  Okay. 
 
Q: Could you  I wanted to as
k you, so it seems that  you really was  unless I'm reading 
wrong what you're saying, but 
you didn't seem to be very 
concerned going to England  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  taking th e trip to England?
 
A: I cried a lot when I fi
rst came there, a lot. 
 
Q: Because it was different? 
 
A: Yes.  Who knew from corn
flakes, who knew of porridge. 
 You know, all these things, 
it was stran g e.  The coffee was awful.  Of c
ourse I didn't drink coffee until a little bit later 
and Œ 
 
Q: Were you worried about what was happen
ing in Europe at hom
e possibly to your 
family? 
 
 
A: Of course.  But we didn't  know about th
e horrors, you know.  They  didn't publish it.  
 
Q: That's  yeah.  
 
A: People didn't know. 
 
Q: So you didn't  learn  about it until  
 
A: We didn't learn  even in America when
 I got there a year la
ter, they didn't know. 
 
Q: And you got to America in
 '40, 1940, or was it '41? 
 
A: That I left?  '40. 
 
Q: '4 0 , mmh mm.  
 

A: England, yeah.  People didn't  it wasn
't published.  And th ey  people came out from 
Europe and said this is going 
on and nobody listened.  They 
couldn't believe it because it 
is unbelievable. 
 
Q: Yeah, that's true.  
 
A: I went to Yad Vashem, and my  husband 
who came from Eastern Europe, wh en he was 
born, it was Russia.  By the time they left 
after World War I, it was Poland.  And he was 
a very sweet man and my  children adored him. 
 After awhile when people get sicker, they 
don't get nicer. 
 
Q: That's true.  What was he 
called?  What was his name?  
 
A: Ben Schore. 
 
Q: Ben Schore?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you  you were already a little bit older in
 England, older than majority of children.  
Did you try  did you try to help  your mo th er
 arrive to England?  Try to work  some 
paperwork  
 
A: I wasn't consulted.  I don't know.  I was 
told she was coming and 
that's  before the war 
started.  So she really got out in the nick 
of time.  And when she came to America, I 
picked her up at some ki
nd of gathering point. 
 
Q: Do you know how she ma
naged to get to America?  
 
A: The  I have no idea  it's too  I don't 
remember now.  But even
tually she remarried.  
And I told you already that?  
 
Q: No, you didn't  say that.  
 
A: I have tw o stepbrothers late in that lif
e.  B y  then, I had ch
ildren so it wasn't so 
entertaining anymore. And they   her husb
and and she bought a very small house in 
Florida, and she was very happy there.  Love
d the gard en ing.  And it was very nice. Then  
we went down ev ery Easter to visit and late
r on.  We went down  because she was sick.  
She had a heart condition, so I had to keep 
flying down  and got anot
her caretaker for her, 
and she was never comfortable or
 happy, and she didn't live very long.  Sh e didn't live to 
see her first grandchild  greatgrandchild.  So rry. 
 
Q: That's u n fortunate.  Did you get to be a
ny closer with her after she arrived to the 
States?  
 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: Yes? 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
 
Q: Were you  
 
A: Again, she was fonder of
 my  husband th an she was of me.  It kept  it happens. 
 
Q: Did you correspond with her 
wh en you were in England? 
 Did you correspond?  Write 
letters?  
 
A: Oh, I even went to Cambridge to visit 
with her.  Sh e's  I didn't mention this, but 
anyhow, she was the world's wo
rst cook, but she became a co
ok in England. Somebody  
some very welloff people, and she cooked from
 the cookbook.  She could do that.  And 
the lady came from so mewhere in Germany also
, and she said we saved oneth irtieth of 
our fo rtune. 
 
Q: Why is that?  
 
A: Well, some people are still very we
lloff had a lovely house in Camb ridge. 
 
Q: That's g o od.  
 
A: So that's  interesting too.  We stayed in 
touch.  When I came to 
America, I didn't write 
nearly as often as I should ha
ve.  It wasn't a happy time. 
 Do you understand?  I dealt 
with it, but it wasn 't a happy time.  
 
Q: Well, I can only try to imag
ine.  You probably were all le
ft to yourself, 
and you had to 
start your new life in America, right?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And with  all the  I mean
, it was such abrupt experien
ces from moving from Europe 
and, you know, leavin g war behind.  You me
ntioned that one person from your family 
was sent to a concentration camp , right?  
 
A: That was Tante Frieda, my mother's sist
er.  She was in France 
and the French police 
took her.  Really aw
ful, really awful. 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: But my  uncle and his wife  he was in one 
of the French camps in  near Paris, but  
 
Q: Did they survive? 
 
A: They got out.  He was the one who was su
pposed to meet me 
in New Yo rk, but he 
didn't . 
 
Q: Oh, that's the one, 
that's the only one.  
 

A: The other, they were family went to Sted
ishav (ph).  One survived, and the others, I 
guess, were starved to death is my  thinking. 
 And this other uncle who to ok me to the 
railroad station, they  came from Dunwich.  So 
he and his family all 
survived.  One of the 
cousins went through th e war with her mo
ther, and she got cancer.  And I think, 
according to a story, she was raped by the Russian
s when they came in.  So that's  but you 
hear this  you know, these stories did happen. 
 
Q: Right, they did.  
 
A: And she had a child apparently that was lo
st during that time, which is really worse 
than wh at happened to  me, mu ch. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And there were four cousins, and we we
re all friends, and we went to for summer 
holidays, and they lived 
in Dunwich, and two of 
them are still alive. 
 
Q: Do you keep in 
touch with them?  
 
A: I  that's another story.  I don't know
 if you've got time for those stories?  
 
Q: I have lo ts of time as long as
 you have a little bit of time.  
 
A: I have to eat lunch soon.  I went to Indi
a, and I decided  I had 
to go by way of London, 
and I was going to stop and visit with this co
usin, and he picked me up at the airport and 
took me to a motel, an d we visited. And the ne
xt day they gave me a very big treat.  They 
took me to the British Museum, which I loved. 
 This is fine.  But while we're h aving a 
small snack, my  bag was gone with everythi
ng, everything, ev erything you can imagine 
in it, mainly the passport and the VISA for 
in India, and it was really quite awful.  
 
And so we went from there to the Americ
an Embassy, Grosvenor Square, where they 
wouldn't let me in because I di
dn 't have identification.  Well, if I h ad identification, I 
wouldn't have to be there.  So anyhow, 
finally somebody came out and let me in, and 
they started the process of giving me a tem
porary passport, and I had to go and get a 
picture taken, all that.  It was a major mess.
 And th en the next day I thought I would not 
be able to get into India because of Britis
h  the Indian High Commi
ssion is closed, but it 
was open on Saturd ay.  So I went there, a
nother cousin took me, her sister, and I waited 
because he had to go and get 
money.  For some reason or ot
her, the banks were closed or 
something.  I don't know.  It could happen
. And an yhow, I waited and waited and waited, 
and they  got very tired of having
 me sit there, and I really want
ed to get out of there.  So 
eventually I got the VISA into
 my new passport.  And then, the next day I was going to  
India and the plane was supposed to leave at 
8:00  9:00 in the mo rnin
g, but it didn't  leave 
until 6:30 in the afternoon, so I sat at the 
airp ort for many hours, and my cousin brought 
some money so I could buy a lipstick an
d a comb.  You know, this is basics. 
 

Q: It is.  
 
A: Yeah.  Anyhow, I didn't  have glasses.  
I didn't have hearing aids.  I didn't have my  
address book.  I didn't have my  house keys for wh en I came back. 
 
Q: Oh, my.  
 
A: This was  it's  nothing to  do with the Ho lo
caust.  It's  just a major catastrophe that 
affected me deeply.  
Then I went to India and the group leaders had money so they 
advanced me money, then at the end I sent th
em a check.  That can be done.  And I sent 
my  cousin money, but he had 
a special arrangement and didn't
 want to lose any money on 
the deal. Anyhow, it all wo
rked out.  India was interesting. 
 Very cold.  We were there in 
January up near the Himalayas.
  Which has nothing to do w
ith what you're interviewing 
me with. 
 
Q: So I was asking ab out your co usins, but
 I guess you do keep 
in touch with your 
cousins, right?  
 
A: This story has something to  
do with this.  I get this Kinderlink.  This is a newspaper 
that's sent out by, 
you know, this group. 
 
Q: That organization, mmh mm .  
 
A: And I came across a note from a man, the 
Reverend somethingsomething.  And he 
was looking for somebody named  who used to
 be Getruhm (ph) a
nd th en his name may 
have been something else and they changed it,
 but anyhow I knew that is my  cousin  in 
London.  And I sent him an email, and he go
t back in touch with 
this fellow. Now, from 
when he was a child, he was Gebcarl (ph).  An
d in th e meantime, he changed his name to 
Charlie, and his last name from RUHM, whic
h was my  grandmother's maiden name.  
Yes, the family name.  They 're married, by the 
way.  And th ey got in
 touch, and he was 
enormously pleased.  
 
Q: Good.  
 
A: It's  all the Kinderlink did it.  I never 
had an ybody that I had anything to do with 
before.  That was a first major deed that I c
ould do th rough that.  So  
he and I are now  we 
corresponded off and on.  We send each 
other Christmas cards.  Haha, we do send 
Christmas cards. 
 
Q: But you do practice Je
wish religion, right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't.  Did you co
me from a religious house? 
 
A: No. 
 

Q: No?  In your home, your mom?  
 
A: Christmas tree s. 
 
Q: Oh, so you were  would you call yourse
lf assimilated pretty mu ch?  That you 
 
A: Abso lutely.  My greatgrandparents had Chri
stmas trees.  This goes back long ago.  
And then we were faced with bein
g Jewish when this all started. 
 
Q: The war started, I see.  So, essentially, yo
u were really mixed in the German society, 
right, before  
 
A: Until they started getting rude or, 
you know, things started happening. 
 
Q: Right.  Until the nationalism started to rise, right?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I have one mo re question if you wouldn't
 mind answering it.  It's probably, I don't 
know, maybe a little b it more personal than th
e other questions. I wa
nted to ask if you 
think that  do you th ink that being on the 
Kinderstransport had  I me an, I've heard 
different stories so far.  Did it have maybe
 any negative or positive impact on who you 
are right now or how your life turned?  
 
A: It doesn't affect  it affected me.  I can 't sa
y  if it's either positive or negative.  It just 
happened  and you deal with it.  Some 
people don't, you know.  A little noise, okay. 
 
Q: Just a little bit.  
 
A: It wasn 't   again, when I first got to England, I cried a lot. 
 
Q: Were the people in England nice to you? 
 
A: Some were.  Some were not. 
 
Q: The families that you stayed with?  
 
A: I never stayed with the two except a few.  Mostly they were quite all right.  
 
Q: Did they try to make it really ea
sy on you?  Did they put any effo rt? 
 
A: I don't think they paid that much a
ttention.  People can be very detached. 
 
Q: So they were just accomm
odating you, essentially?  Is 
that what you would call it? 
 
A: Well, I don't know why they  took me in, but 
they did.  I think there mu st have been  
the church es probably passe
d around  Church of Engl
and probably  passed around 
requests, you know, who would take a ch
ild, and I was there.  I was taken. 
 
Q: I see, yeah.  Did you make any fri
ends during your st
ay in England? 
 

A: Yes. 
 
Q: With other Kinderstransport ch ildren? 
 
A: Sometimes. 
 
Q: Or with British children? 
 
A: Very few.  But they were, you know  th
ere were other Germanspeaking ch ildren, let's 
put it that way. 
 
Q: There were, really?  
 
A: In North Hampton particularly. 
 
Q: Like immigrants, German immigrants? 
 
A: There were other children from other coun
tries from b eing on kindertransports too. 
 
Q: Oh, from the kindertransports.  
 
A: Not all of them. 
 
Q: Mmhmm.  Do you  
 
A: I don't know how the rabbi with the cleric
al collar, how he got there.  His name was 
Arabah (ph). 
 
Q: Are you maybe keeping in touch still with
 some of those friends that you made?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No.  How about that boy that called you after the dance?  
 
A: Oh, I never saw him again either because  
he was very sweet.  He was also an art 
student and this  I guess they shipped me out of town . 
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: But it's  you know, it was an
 other  a different time.  A ttitudes were very different. Q: 
Right, yes, very conservative.  I mean, mu
ch more.  And the tr
ip from Ireland to the 
United States, you said that mainly those were
 new  American citizens, right?  People 
who just discovered or  
 
A: Just  just American s barely, you know. 
 
Q: Right.  So how did that trip look like? 
 Wh at did it look like?  Can you describe it a 
little bit?  
 
A: It was a big one. 
 

Q: What happened ev ery 
day?  Wh ere did you  
 
A: It was a cruise ship when it wasn 't during the war. 
 
Q: Did you stay in one of the better cabins? 
 
A: I was staying in one of those cots on th e swimming pool. 
 
Q: Oh, that's where you were sleeping.  
 
A: So did th e other girls.  
Q: And what did you  I mean, what wa
s the food like?  What did you eat? 
 
A: The food was fine except for 
in  the beginning I was seasick. 
 
Q: And how about  I mean, so many people
.  Was it overcrowded?  Obviously it was 
overcrowded, the ship, right?  
 
A: It didn't seem particularly terrible.  I 
mean, that was the least of our problems, you 
know. 
 
Q: Right.  Did you  di
d you have any shower fa
cilities o n  the ship?  
 
A: I don't remember.  I have no idea what  ho
w that worked at that time.  For all I know, I 
didn't  take a shower in six, seven da
ys.  It's possible.  I don't reme mber. 
 
Q: So th e trip took six, seven days only? 
 
A: Six. 
 
Q: Six.  Did you make any friends on the sh ip? 
 
A: Many, yes.  But then afterwards
, they were gone again, you know. 
 
Q: I see.  So nothing  no lasting fr
iendships from the ship or England?  
 
A: Well, except for this lady who is here as well who was in the same school as I was. 
 
Q: You mentioned her.  In the same art sc
hool, right?  Was she in the art school with 
you?  
 
A: In the same girls school. 
 
Q: Can you refresh my  memory?  Was it 
the same girls school in England? 
 
A: In England, yeah. 
 
Q: In England, mmh mm.  And what is her name?  
 
A: Ellen Gerber now. 
 

Q: Ellen Gerber? 
 
A: Her name then was Machovich or someth
ing like th at.  She's a lovely wo man.  
Younger than I, everybody is.  
And we stayed  after she found
 me at one of these Kinder 
reunions.  I went with my husband to the Catsk
ills, and we didn't meet there, but she read 
the roster. 
 
Q: And she recognized your name?  
 
A: No.  And she recognized that
 we were at the same school. 
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: She didn't rememb er me, but when
 she called me, I knew who she was. 
 
Q: Did you  I wonder in being one of the olde
r children, did you try 
to take care of some 
of the younger girls? 
 
A: There were no youngers.  We were all sort of teenagers in the co
mpartment I was in.  I 
was in a compartmen
t leavingBerlin. 
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: And then the ship going to
  from Brooklyn Harlem to Harwich was  again, was a little 
bit crowded but the crossings on th e channel always were. 
 
Q: Right.  And do you reme mber crossing 
the English Channel?  I mean, was that 
remarkable? 
 
A: I was sleeping.  It was during the night. 
 
Q: You were lucky.  Several people 
say that they were getting seasick.  
 
A: I got seasick on other occasions.  As a child,
 I went to Sweden, and I was so seasick.  
It was also an interesting holid
ay except wh en  I came back to Berlin, my  grandfather had 
died, and that was really major trauma. 
 
Q: So he died before the war started?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Before you went on 
the Kinderstransport? 
 
A: That was in  well, it had to be in '34. 
 
Q: Oh, so quite a bit before
.  Do you rememb er any of the escalating atmo sphere in 
Berlin, how things were changing?  
 

A: Well, you can read the Stürmer while you 
were waiting for the bus or the trolley or 
whatever because they had th ese horrible articles and pict
ures.  I w as standing there 
waiting so I read them. 
 
Q: So you were  let'
s say, you were probably  betwee
n 12  around 12, right, when  you 
started reading these?  You were born  
 
A: Yeah, I must have been maybe  yeah. 
 
Q: What year were you born? 
 
A: '24. 
 
Q: 1924.  
 
A: Yeah.  I don't think they  th
ings were so overt until '35 or 
so.  I mean, they were there, 
you know.  
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And the flags were hanging, and 
we knew things were not wonderful. 
 
Q: Did your parents manage to  
 
A: My mother. 
 
Q: Your mo ther, right.  Did your mo ther 
ma nage to, I guess, secure some of your 
savings  I don't know  possessions, or did that all get lost?  
 
A: Actually, it all got lost.  Except we were
 allowed  you know that from other people.  
We were allowed one  two sets of silverware 
per person.  So my mother took two, and I 
took two, and th e mitchen (ph). 
 
Q: The nanny, right? 
 
A: The only Jewish maid in 
Berlin, she brought two over two 
too, and I gave th em to my  
granddaughter when she had a shower when sh
e got married.  She may never use them.  
They'r e very  the end of the 
blades should be replaced, 
and the  anyhow, with  other 
things, we did not  later on my mother brough
t some more books, and I still have a lot of 
the books in German that I had read and  
 
Q: And I'm sure you 
probably still speak very
 good German, right?  
 
A: I can read German.  I can speak German be
tter.  Last  did I tell 
you that yet?  Last 
March I was in Eilat.  
 
Q: No, I don't believe so.  
 

A: And on a birding trip, and 
there was a very nice young man who led a German group.  
And wh en I told him  he spoke fluent Englis
h.  And when  I told him that I was born in 
Berlin, Landhaus Striesen.  He said he lives
 two blocks from there. Anyhow, there were 
many German people there, French and English.
  Lots of English, 
Russians, Poles, they 
were all holidaying in  on the Re
d Sea, and they left.  And ther
e was this guy's t w in sister 
and there was many  and I decided  I never 
speak German anymore for obvious reasons, 
there's nobody to sp eak German with or to. 
 So with them I st
arted singing oldlittle 
Whoop De Doo songs and stuff like that, and 
I was surprised that I remembered . But in 
19  I forget, before the wall came down, mu
st have been  '88, we went to Germany 
because Berlin invited us.  I wa
sn 't going to go, bu
t then my husband ha
dn't been there so 
it was an invitation, so we we
nt.  And surp rising thing was th
e words that came back to 
me that I h adn't used in years  
 
Q: A long time.  
 
A:  and years, you know.  And so
, we went to Berlin and they
 treated us very nicely, and 
we ate the stuff that I used 
to look. Like audilgoza.   
Q: I think I know what that
 is.  That's currants.  
 
A: Oh, it's yummy.  What else 
did they have?  Oh, I don't kno
w.  It was okay.  And they 
took us to the opera and the 
Berlin Philharmonic and play.  
And then  they asked us if I 
wanted to meet a German couple
.  I said no, that's all rig h t.
  No, thank you.  If you want 
to do something for me, I said 
take me birding. And they to
ok me to a forest, and there 
was a man who was a birder, and he asked me
 what do you want to see, and I said 
everything.  So we had an extremely nice mo rn
ing.  My husband didn't go.  He wasn't up 
to that kind of stuff and that was ve
ry nice.  I had a wonderful time.
