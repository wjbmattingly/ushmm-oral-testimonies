Ans wer: M y  na me is Fl ora Si nger ,
 my maiden name is
 Me ndelowitz( ph) , and i n the United Stat es , 
Mendelowit z(ph) .  I  was  bor n in Ber che m( ph) , which is
 a suburb of An twerp, 
Belgium.  On August  
16, 1930. 

Question: Tell me a 
little bit about your fa mily
 life before the war. 
A: Oka y.  M y dad had a furnit
ure workshop a nd mo m 
wa s a house kee per, hous e, home maker .  We  
were three small childre
n.  An d we lived i n wh a t  wa s kn o w
n as a Je wis h nei ghbor hood, whi ch 
enc o mpa sse d sort of six, se ven stre e t s in Ant we r
p.  We we nt to school , 
Friday night we ha d a  
Sabbat h di nner, Sat urda y we went t o  syna gogue, 
but Sat urda y  aft ernoon so
meti mes we snu ck o ff to  
the movies .  And life was plea sant
, you know, wit h three si sters , 
someti me s we played together,  
other ti me s we fought, we di d hom
ework, ther e was a beaut i ful cloc
k at the end of our street , and 

aft er sc hool we 'd go and play ther e, we 'd ri de 
our bike s, we 'd pla y ball on t he wall next t o our  
apart me nt hous e and li fe kind of was plea sant .  
It was plea sant .  On the wee k-e nd, on Sundays ,  

neighbors , fr iends, eve r ybody'd ge
t on their bikes, we'd
 go the par k, ha ve  a 
pi cni c .  And t he par k  
wa s a be aut i ful par k, it wa s calle d t he Lane ke vi tz
stra k(ph) Par k and ha d 
a bea uti ful pond with 
swans and we e njoye d i t .  I re- vis
ited it recentl y and, seems small er 
than i t  did when I  was s mall .  
And, eve r yt hing see me d  alright for 
awhile a nd what I di dn't  realiz
e, however , was t hat the, t her e 
wa s a depre s sion.  And that my da
d was havi ng fi nancial proble ms .  He eve ntuall y lost his busi nes s 
whi c h was , he ha d a fur niture works
hop.  He ma de cus t om furnitur e .  
He lost it.  And then went off 
to the coal mi nes t o get  work.  Pe
ople tried to get work just about 
wher ever t hey could.  And, he 
even worked for t he Four
th Company for a short wh
i l e.  And then eventua
lly got a pos ition wit h a 
stea mship c o mpa ny and starte d saili ng t he  se ven sea s

rly '36, '37.  And a t

that ti me  we  had gone  ba ck, we 
had gone , I  wouldn't sa y back exactl
y,  my  mo m d i d go
 bac k, but  we  
we nt with  my mo m t o R o mani a b eca use my  fa mil y or
i ginated fr om there, and 
that was the last time 
I saw my  grandfather, my 
gr andmot her and ma ny of 
my a unt s  and uncle s.  Most  of the m did per i sh  
in Auschwitz.  By 1937, we ra
rely saw my father.  
We al wa ys sa w h i m lik
e every t h ree months, 
ever y four mont hs, when he 'd c o
me home for about two or three 
da ys  and the n woul d take off 
agai n.  At a bout the sa me ti me, he  ma de t he a cqu
aintance of an officer  on 
his st ea mship, on t h e  
stea ms hip he  wor ke d on, the man 
wa s  a Ger ma n a nd a Chri stia n.  
And I ' m me ntioni ng t hat be cause 
he'll be coming into our liv
es la ter on agai n.  Ot her wise , I woul dn
't ha ve  identi fi ed
 him like that. 
Carl  would not al ways be abl e t o
 go back to Germany when the sh
ip docked in Antwerp to see hi s 
fa mi ly beca use ti me wa s short , s o 
he would sta y wit h us and we b
eca me very fond of hi m.  In 1938, 
there was an influx of re
fuge es i n Ant wer p.  The y ca me fr om 
Austria , fr om Ge r many and the whol e  
Je wish c o mmunit y opened up t heir home s for t he m. 
 We , oursel ves , in our s ma ll apart ment , ha d 
four  pe opl e stayi ng with us.  I  thi n
k it was four, I'm not 
sure if it was three or
 four , but  from what I  
re me mber, t here were t wo c ouples .  And ar ound th
e dinner table a lot of talk was going on about  

what we nt on in Ger m any, about
 wh at I know now to be Chry
stal nacht(ph) , and I reme mber  
bec o ming fe arful , I re me mber going t o be d and 
thi nki ng a bout it and I sa y, well , maybe we 're going 
to ha ve t o r u n a wa y.  And I woul
d  as k my mo th er  abo ut 
it , a nd she sai d, don't worry, ol d pe opl e tell  
stories, they're exaggerating.  
She says, nothing's happen
ing, Austria, German
y, they're civilized 
countries.  The peopl e there are lik
e here, s he sa ys , maybe some things are happe ning, a fte r all, you  
know, I al ways t ell you that t her
e ar e peopl e who are an
ti se meti c, and who don't li ke J ews, but  
nothing like what th
ey're telling you.  
So, time went on. 
Q: Let  me just, be fore you go furt
her, just  as k, you sa id that  you 
l i ve d i n a  Je wis h c o mmunit y.  Di d  
you have c o ntact  with Christia n pe ople?

A: Oh, s ure .  Of c ourse .  I we nt t o public s chool . 
 I went to public school 
a nd t hen a fter  school t he 
boys went to what they called He
brew school and the little girls we
nt to what they called Yiddish 
school .  We learne d how to
 read and write in 
Yiddish.  Of course we ha
d cont act bec a use  in public  
school it wa s mi xed.  I didn't go 
to a secul ar, I mean I went  to 
a secul ar  school, I di dn't go to a  
religi ous school .  So, yes ,  we di
d have  cont act, but the rea son I me
ntione d the Je wis h nei ghbor hood , 
is, there wer e Je wis h pe ople livi ng a l l  over Antwe r p, 
but the neighborhood that
 I'm speaking
 of wa s, 
I woul d al most sa y 90% Je wis h.  Ther e were 
Christians living ther
e also, but it was the 
neighborhood where you had all the kos her butc hers
, you had syna gogues  al
most on e very s econd  
street , a nd kosher re sta ur ants , a nd i f you rea lly wa
lk t hose str eets you real ly
 di dn't t hink there was  
another world.  As a 
matter of fa ct, until I went to kindergart
en, I spoke just Yiddish.  I didn't know 
there wer e other languages, except the Hungaria
n and Ruma nian tha t  I he ard my pare nts s pea k,  
which I never learned.  So, for me
, until I went into regular public 
school, I thought that the only 
people who existed were Je
wi sh people.  But the n, of c our se , I ca me in c ont act wit h ever yone.  And 
spea king of school , in Be
lgium, in many of the Eu
ropea n c ountries , s chool 
i s n't fi ve  da ys a  wee k  
like here i n  the Unit ed States.  You go t o scho
ol on Monday, Tues day, Wednes day, full days.  
Thurs day is  a hal f  da y and t he n
 a hal f day on Sat urd
ay.  So, we we r e  not
 excused fr om that , 
although many times, we were ab
sent on Saturdays.  However, 
whe n we di d go t o school , our  
teacher woul d excuse us from r ead
ing, I mean fr om writing on the 
board or writi ng in our notebooks  
and then I had one teacher who sat 
us in the back of the room so
 s he woul d re me mb
er who not t o 
call on t o wr ite.  And that  wa sn't ove rl y c o mfort abl e,
 but it was something that
 we adjusted to.  And, 
oka y, going bac k to '3 8, '39, t here 
wa s, I re me mber heari ng ta lk 
about Pol and being invaded and I  
hear d talk a b out Bel gium being ne utr a
l, but it was very vague at that pa
rticular time.  
It wasn't until 
later tha t  I le arne d the ful l  histor y of t hat.  I n 19
40, the s pri ng of 1940, I wa
s at a summer camp.  I n

Bel gium, you had soci ali zed me di
c i ne, you als o had a  syste m wher
e by poor c hildr en wer e offere d  
what t hey c a lled Fre sh Air Ca mp e xperi enc e .  An
d you would be a ble  t o go a wa y for a bout t w o 
weeks to a Fresh Air Camp to kind
 of be physically rehabilitated, ge
t good food, get fr esh air so that 
we 'd stay he althy.  So, I  wa s se
nt to one ca mp for t w
o weeks and one of my 
sist ers wa s se nt to  
anot her ca mp.  And I re me mber t he 
morni ng, thi s is very clear in 
my  min d ,  the  mor n
ing of Ma y 10,  
1940.  We were sitting and, 
to the best of my recoll
ection, having breakfast 
in the dining
 room, and  
the radi o wa s playi ng s o me music ,
 the mu sic was stoppe d and an 
announc e me nt was made that t he 
Ger man ar mies are walking int o
 Bel gium.  Whic h shoc ked t h
e couns elor s, e v eryone , the y  
practi cally j u mped out of t heir seats.  And r ushed 
us t o fi nis h our bre akfas
t.  Took us bac k to t h e  
dorms, we had to pack our little ba
gs, they got us 
onto buses and took us back
 to Antwerp.  I got  
there, I reme mber getting to Antw
er p and I remember the 
str eet s bei ng full of pe opl e, r u shing back 
and fort h a n d tal king.  It  wa s very c haoti c.  Ve
r y chaoti c.  Al most, yo
u know looki ng bac k on i t  
now, is I ca n under sta nd i t , what ha ppene d is ev
er ybody wa s c a ught by s ur p
rise .  Nobody expect ed  
it.  And pe ople were pa c king up 
wa gons , and this  holds true for 
bot h the Chr i stia n and the Je wi sh 
populati on.  Eve r yone  was 
running.  Bec ause fr om what I  lea rned 
later on, is the Be
lgians were as 
afr aid of the Ger mans as anybod
y el s e would be , at the ti me .  
Bec ause duri ng Worl d WarII ,t here  
wa s a l ot of resista nce  in Bel gi u
m and...World War I, I'm sorry, I ap
ologize.  Wo rl d War I.  There  
was a lot of resistance in Belgium against the Germ
ans.  And, fro m what I  heard at t he ti me , was 
that the , a lot of t orturi ng took place .  So Belgi ans
 were t ortur e d and t he y wer e fr ighte ned.  I don't  
have, mysel f, any speci fi c cases t h
at I could doc ume nt, but it 's so
rt of one of these known fact s 
wit hin t he c ountry.  So, ever yb
ody wa s runni ng.  Now, 
we had a  sli ght proble m.  My mother a nd 
the t w o of us.  By t he
n, of course , re me mbe r  
I said my  father was 
on a s hi p.  Mea n whil e, 
unbeknowns t  to us, my fath
er 's s hip i n '3 8, had docked in Ca na
da and he had a si
ster who lived in

Ne w York, who had bee n se
nt there aft er World Wa
r I beca use he r fat her  had bee n ki lled on t he  
fr ont and there was an aunt in Ne
w York who was willing to
 take in the little girl
 and raise her.  So, 
my father ca lled her from Ca nada and she s ays , have
 you he ard?   This wa s a f ter Nove mbe r  of 1938 , 
have you he ard what ha ppe ne d in 
Ger many?   And my father  says, 
no, what a re you t alking about ? 
She says, don't go back.  He says, 
what do you mean, don't go back?  
I've got my wi fe , I've got the 
two children, I've go
t to go back.  And she urge
d hi m to sta y a n d s he se nt
 s o me one for hi m and t he y 
illegally brought hi
m into the United States.  
I shouldn't even sa
y this, but he beca
me legalized.  He  
eventuall y entered the Ameri can 
Ar my, served honorabl
y a n d was honor ably dis cha r ged.  As soon 
as he got to New York a
nd settled down, they starte
d making arrangements to
 bring us to the United 
State s.  That , they e ncountere d great di ffic ulty.  Firs
t of all, my father wasn't
 her e lega lly, as yet. 
Secondly, we, even i f my uncle 
and aunt  made the ar
r ange me nts t o bri ng us, we fell under  the 
Ruma ni an quota .  The Rumani an q
uota, as for mo st Eastern European
 J ews, wa s very l ong.  It c oul d 
someti me s t a ke up t o 10 ye ars , wai ting t o c o
me.  And I c a me acr oss  so
mething that was very 
interesting here in the United St
ates, in the i mmi gration depart me
nt of the yea rs '37 t hrough '40, 
immigrants were listed bycountries, except for one 
group.  One group wa s lis
te d a s Hebre ws .  I 'll  
show it to you later. 
 But , anywa y, gett ing back t o 1940.  I ha
d been se nt to t he summe r c a mp as di d, 
my second sister was sent.  So, 
two of us had been away.  I was back now, the little one, the 
youngest wa s bac k.  The  mi ddl e one 
wa sn't ba ck yet.  No
w, mother  tried desperat ely to reach t h e 
ca mp.  We  didn't ha ve a  phone  in 
our home .  She  had to go t o  a shop 
to get, actually, most of the 
phone s were  at the post  office , to t r y to cal l.
  So me how, she couldn'
t get through.  An d had 
absolutely no knowledge wher e my mi ddle si ster  was.
  Someone with a car and a trundle seat in the 
back, getting ready to escape to 
France, because that's where ev
erybody was heading, everybody 
wa s hea ding towards Norther n Fra nc e, offe red us  a 
seat i f we  would j ust 
go right a wa y.  And my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

mother  had a terri ble dil e mma .  Doe s
 she ta ke t w o of us a nd go, does
 she wait for the third one and  
get st uc k a n d lose a ll the  chil dre n, 
as well?   And I  learne d l ater, of 
course, at that time I didn't know, 
although she talked about it, I 
ha d a  va gue re col l ection of what 
she was telling me.  Because  I 
re me mber her sayi ng, Fl orika ( ph), 
that's a diminutive in 
Belgium for Flora, we 
ha ve to try to fin d  
Charlott e so we can leave.  But , 
I r e me mber her al so s ayi ng, i f I can
't fi nd  h e r, ma
ybe we shoul d go 
anywa y and see i f we ca n fi nd her la ter on.  An
d, whil e she wa s ponderi ng thi s quest i on, whic h I 
now as a mo ther and a gr andmother, I  realize it 's on e of the most di ffic ult ones you e ver  have t o do , 

and I hope that no mot her  ever ha s to ponder t his ki
nd of dilemma.  Sh e kept 
talking, but at the same 
time  she started packing 
some little bags.  My yo
ungest sister at the time
 had t he me a sles a nd she 
had a hi gh fever , which wa s a not her  pr oble m.  
The  people who ha d t he  car  ke pt sa ying, we 'r e  
leaving, we'r e not waiting any mo
re.  And she kept begging them
, wait a little while
 longer, maybe 
they'll bring my Charlotte.  Finally
, t hey sai d, no, we 're going.  A
nd she made a  de ci
si on.  She t old 
one of the neighbor s who ha d de ci
de d not to go, to wa
it out t he war or whatever was coming, she 
says, i f my Charlott e come
s, pl ease kee p her for us.  And we got 
into the car, into the trundle seat in 
the back, it was an ope
n seat, and we, we we nt.  
So, it was the two of us an
d my mo m.  An d h e r ide a  
wa s that if we  ca n get to Fran
ce , ma ybe t o Calais( ph) , a n d ma yb
e get a ship to Britain, Great 
Britain, ma ybe fr om there,
 and she was, pur e fant as
y.  We  had no Visas, 
not hing.  But, s o mehow, 
this is t he  pl an t hat  she had ma de .  Fr om Brita
in to get to the United
 State s.  So, we  we nt. 
Q: Wasthis kind 
of e xcit i ng for  you?   Or s cary?  
A: I rememb er, what I re
me mber is not underst anding why we 'r
e not waiting for Charlotte.  That I 
re me mber.  And, it was , I don't  
know, I c an't e xpl ain it , it wa s  fr
ightening, I don't 
re me mb er bein g  
excite d.  I don't re me mb er bei ng e xc ited.  I t  was a 
lot of chaos, and it was,
 it was s t ra nge .  But , I  
can't say e xc ited in the s ense of feeli ng like I ' m l i ving a dra m a or anyt hing like that .  No, I don't

recall anythi ng li ke that .  I just  re
member it  bei ng very chaoti c, ver y
 strange, and I 
re me mb er hav i n g  
to, to j ust sit  in the car a nd cl utching my doll , I 
had a fairly new doll that 
I had gotte n just be fore I  
had gone a w ay to the c a mp.  And I r e me mbe r  clutching my doll and hol di ng on to her ,  to the doll . 
My mot her placed t he litt l e one on 
my lap, and I reme
mber her being very hot.
  So, there wer e ver y, 
there were ma ny physical things 
going on, so mentally, I don't re
me mber too ma ny sensations.  I 
re me mb er b e ing  u nco mf ortabl e,  I re me mb er  tryi ng 
t o hol d my doll, I r e me mber  my si ster who wa s  

very hot, be ing pla ced on my lap, a nd not unde
rstanding why Charlotte wasn't co ming with us. 
That  wa s t he  middle sist e r
 that we  couldn't fi nd. 
Q: What el se  di d yo
u ta ke  wi th you?  
A: We had two suitcases.  Th ey were
 large in my ey
es , but  I le arne d lat er on 
that they weren't quite 
that bi g.  They als o starte d fe eling ver y hea vy la
ter  on.  Anywa y, the c ar we nt, you coul dn't go, yo u 
coul d walk faster than yo
u could ri de beca use , as I  said, eve r
ybody was running.  An
d, what I di dn't  
learn until later on, is that we we
re part of the refu gees that bl
ocked the roads wh
ich prevented the  
Allies, the Allies were the French
 and some of the British, fr om 
pulling back, or trying to get 
through on t he roads.  
We , beca us e  I re me mber , thi s was a f te
r the war, I remember readi ng and 
learni ng about the roads  bei ng bloc
ked by r e fuge es, and I l ea r ned the n
 t h at we wer e part o f t hat 
group of r e fuge es.  The car ran out of gas, t here wa
sn't any to be gotte n, so the y jus t , the pe opl e le ft  
the car , so we left t he car and th
en we wer e  on our own.  We sl ept 
in the fi e l ds, where ve r  you c oul d 
just fi nd a s p ot.  With our  suitc ase s. 
 Or a barn some where, if a farmer
 allowed you to stay in there.  
And we did, we  di d ma ke  it t o Cal ais( ph) . 

Q: ______________?  

A: We ll, we did get a train for a 
short whi l e, t he tr ain st opped i n 
the mi ddl e  of the r oa d, people had  
to get off the trains.  It took 
se veral  day s .  N e ith er mys e l f or  my mo m re me mb er ed p r ecisel y ho w

ma ny days, but it was se veral days .  I re me mber being,
 we were in a railroad station, and this was in  
Cala is(ph) , but not nea r  the port .
  And we wer e, our plan wa s at
 t hat poi nt, mo m deci ded, wel l , 
ma ybe we s houldn't just go to the po
rt to try to get to Great Britain, 
maybe we should just try to ge t 
to Pari s, ma ybe t hat would be sa fer.  So, we were
 in the railr oa d stati on, and I re me mbe r  being ver y 
tired and we  had slept on
 our suitcases in the station and th
en we deci ded to 
just a bandon one  
suitca se be c ause mo m had to carr y my litt le sist er
 who was four , and who, 
not quite , this was in  
May and she wasn't  four until th
e following, the 
next month, June
.  What's happening to my 
English?  It's fu nn
y, when I get emotional, I 
lose my ability to speak.  
We left one suitcase in the 
railroa d stat i on.  I r e me mber we hi d it  behi nd a c o
rner beca use  we wer e a fr aid s o meone  would see  
us and run after us an
d tell us we left  a suitcase
.  We  thought that was illega
l.  We then went to the 
port and we, I sat on a suitcase, the 
one suitcase t h at we ha
d left, with my little 
si ster and my mothe r  
sa w a bi g shi p and the y were loa din
g s oldier s on the shi p.  And she 
we nt ove r there a nd s he spoke to  
some one .  I didn't  know who she  s p
oke to, but she spoke 
t o someone and when 
she came back she  
said, we 're going to wait here , ma ybe
 they'll t ake  us, t hey're  goi ng t o
 go t o England. 
 It was a Red 
Cross ship.  So, we sat . 
 And we sat t hrough the night a nd t he y
 ke pt loa di ng wounded soldi ers .  By  
da wn, t he man mo m had spoke n t o wal k
ed over  to us and he
 said, sorry, there's no
 room, it's full . 
And he coul dn't 
take us.  So, we tri ed to find a pl ace t o 
stay.  As we were 
wal king away, we saw 

people scr ea mi ng, anybody want t o go to Engla nd,
 there 's a s hi p here , you c an come , every, people  
just loaded onto a ship.  I learned later that th
is was a shi p tha t  was 
a ba ndone d and some one who  

knew how to steer just took
 the, just went in took 
the ship and invited peop
le to come onto it.  
Bec ause, I me an, it 's incredi ble and it's di ffic ult  to
 descri be , what t hings  looke d like.  It was just , 
people were running and coming 
and goi ng and nothi ng was t he way 
nor...quote , no

wa sn't a  ver y lar ge shi p, but i t  wa
s  sti ll good siz e.  And 
the r e were ca bi ns, a nd we sa t a g ainst  a wall  
on t he deck, on t he floor , against 
a c abin, but fa c i ng t he doc k .  Ot
her pe ople sat on the other si de 
facing t he water.  And, 
I ' m sa ying t hi s for  a  rea son, what  ha pp
ene d, once t he shi p wa s full, suddenl y  
the tide went down as it 
typically does towards evening, and th
e ship tilted.  The 
people on the other  
side started sliding down 
because the ship kept tiltin
g.  We ended up sitting 
on the cabin wall.  But, 
we  were  sa fe.  And, of cour se, th
ey did ma na ge  to sa ve mo st of
 the pe ople.  They threw them 
ladders a nd we we re all pulle d up. 
 From there we found 
a church, we gave up on 
goi ng to Engla nd .  
We found a chur ch a nd t he Red Cr
os s was givi ng out mi lk for  child
ren and things lik
e that, so we  
got a little milk and then
 we went out to try to fi
nd a place to stay
.  As we were wa
lking the street, 
the sire ns ca me  on and we e nde d up
 in a shelter, a bo mb 
shelter.  We  stayed there for awhi le, when 
the cle ar sire n rang, mo m said, you 
know what, you st ay here  with Be
tty, I'll go find us a place to  
stay.  So, she left 
me in the shelter and I sat 
there by myself with my littl
e sister.  An
d I sat and I 
wait ed and I  waite d and I waite d.  And the n a fter  aw
hil e I pa nicked.  And I went out of the s helt er 
with my little sister, meanwhile sh
e kept crying, she was thirsty, and 
I had nothing to give her.  So, 
the street s wer e deser t e d a nd the y wer e fai r ly
 dark, and I  wal ke d s c re a mi ng, ma mma , ma mma , 
mamma, all of a sudden I 
hear so meone calling, Flora,
 Flora, Flora.  Mom 
had forgotten where she  
had l e ft us, because we di
dn't know Calais( ph) .  So, she was wa
lking t he str eets hoping t hat I woul d 
have left the shelter maybe, and 
she kept calling and hoping that I 
would hear and I 
was calling, so 
we did find each other.  At t hat poi nt , we went
, found anot her ch
urch, well, to make a long st ory 
short , be ca us e this was le ngt hy, we e n ded up in 
Bulangsume re( ph) .  In Bula ngs umer e(ph) we sta ye d  
put .  By t hen the  Ge r ma n Ar my  ha d wal ke d 
int o Nort hern France , a nd we got st uc k in 
Bul angsumere(ph), so we stayed 
ther e, we found a place to st ay 
wit h a woman who had a bar and 
mo m helped her so t hat we could eat
.  And we were there 
for, I woul d s ay, about fi ve or six weeks.

By then an order came out that an
yone who was not a lega l reside nt 
of France must return to their 
countrie s of origi n.  So, we deci de
d to return to Belgium.  We  st
arted walking back, transportation  
wa s a  mes s, you c oul dn't eve n get 
on t rains , r ails were bombed and 
everyt hi ng.  And we hitchhiked. 
As a matter of fact, with 
Ger ma n s oldiers, we did h
itchhike.  Anyway, we made
 it back to Antwerp.  
Got to Antwerp... 
Q: With German soldiers? 

A: Yeah, right, we hitc
hhiked, the German Ar my . 
 Well, the Germans, we'r
e in Nort hern France. 
And we nee ded to get ba
ck to Be lgium,  so... 
Q: And they gave you a  ri de?  

A: The y gave us a ride .  Of c our se , t hey didn'
t know wh o we we re, what
 we we re, you know, but 
they di dn't gi ve us  a r i de  a ll th
e  wa y, just, you know, piece me al .  
Q: One question.  I t hink I recal l in an earli er 
i nterview you di d, 
you tal ked about seei ng a lot  of 
looti ng and... 
A: Oh, yea h. Yea h.  Oka y, her e 's what happene
d.  While mom was he lpi ng the woman worki ng i n  
the bar and everything else, my little
 sister and I, we wa
ndered the streets.  An
d every time you had 
sirens a nd you had the  bombi ng, st or es were bo mbed
, st ore s wer e br oken, and pe opl e, people broke 
windows.  And we passed, 
it  was a shoe store t hat 
we had, we ke pt pas s, 
it was more than a shoe 
store , bec aus e they als o had clot hing.  And ther e wa
s a pair of whi t e boots i n
 the window [laughter], 
it was kind of a silly thing in the 
middle of a wa r, but anyway, it wa s 
a pair of white b
oots that I kept  
looking at.  I just, oh, w
oul d I love t o ha ve those  whit e boots !
  Anyway, this pa
rtic ul ar day, my 
sister and I wer e wal king a
nd we  se e  a lot  of pe ople i n fr ont of 
t his  sto r e.   An d we
 get  t here and we 
see people walking out with packag
e s, the wi ndow wa s br oke n, it wa s 
an absolute mess
.  And I sa w, 
so I we nt over, a nd I s o me how, we ma de our  way into t he s t ore 
and I see the white boots.  And I

grabbe d the whi t e boots and 
t here wa s two rain c o ats, a not her kind
 of a coa t, and I grabbed t hat and 
a pa ir of boots  for my  siste r , 
and we ran out.  I di
dn't even try them on
.  I just thought, 
appr oxi ma te ly, I j ust gr a bbe d the m.  Anywa y, t he y di
d fit.  And I loved t he m
.  And she love d hers.  
And we, and the r ain coat . 
 And we  come  ba ck, I c o me
 to the bar, and the fi rs
t thing my mother says  
is, what i n the worl d is that?   So, I told her , 
I says , ever ybody wa s taki ng, you know, t he stor e wa s  
ope n, everybody was t a kin
g.  So, s he wa s, I le arne
d later, at the 
ti me  she just  sai d , you're  not  
supposed to take t hings  you don't  
pa y for the m.  But, she  di d not ta ke
 t he m awa y fr om us.  We kept  
them.  Anyway, one day [l
aughter] I was, you know
, in the mi ddle of chaos, i n t he middle of such 
dramati c ti mes, there wer e these mo
ments that there is some humor to
 it in a way, but I didn't laugh 
at the ti me .  One da y, I ' m wal king on the stre et, a n
d all of a sudden I feel
 some body gra bbi ng me by  
the back.  It was the owne
r of the stor e.  And he made me t ake
 off the boots  and t he rai n coat , whic h 
I wor e sunshine or rai n or  what eve r , s o that was th
e end of t hat .  Is that wha t  you were r eferring to?  
We ll, I didn't steal for a l ong ti me, I wa s tol d late r on 
t hat t his  wa s steal ing.  So my mot her was i n a  
dile mma at t hat ti me , too.  You know?   It wasn
't  a  ti me where you t aught c hildre n hone sty or not , 
you know?  You survived
.  Anyhow, we came  ba
ck to Belgium eventua
lly.  There wer e a few 
incident s, li ke I woul d br ag, you know, r eall y, you
 want t o ge t food, you know, i f you were lit tle,  
eve n a dult s would pus h you a sid
e, okay, get away, get away.  An
d t he y wer e  st ro
nger, so they 
would push you out of li ne
, bec aus e t hey wa nte d t he br ead.  But,
 a nywa y, we ma de it , we got bac k  
to Ant wer p and one of t he neighb
ors  did ha ve Charlotte .  Cha r lotte
, I don't know whether she ever  
speaks about  it, as a matt er of 
fact , s h e wa s jus t  intervie we d by the Spiel ber g(ph) pr oject  and I don't  
know i f she ever , c an you e dit t his  out? 

Q: We 're not  going t o e di t .

A: Oh, you'r e not goi ng t o edit .  
Well  then, well a nywa y, I don't know
 i f she ever for g ave mo m.  I  
don't know i f s he 's menti one d it eve n, but I must a sk 
her , but I don't know i f 
she ever forgave mom. 
I don't thi nk she ever understood 
why ma mma t ook off wi thout  her.  And s h e aske d a fe w ti mes , and 
mo m c ould not explai n it.  She ke
pt sayi ng, I thought I coul d save
 t wo children i nste a d of losi ng 
three.  That was her answer .  An
d there were difficult decisions to 
be ma de.  I fel t
 sorry for mom, 
because t hat 's, I know t his was somet hing that  
was al ways  on her mi nd, it was al wa ys there.  
Anyway, we settled back in
 Antwerp, and, except fo
r bombs, planes that we
 heard, seeing German 
soldiers in the streets, life  took up a normal routin
e again.  September , we we
nt back to school .  By 
Oct ober, howe ver , Je ws  were supposed to re gist
er.  Re gister ing was that  you ha d to go to the  
munici pal buildi ng, ____________
_, admini strati on a nd r egi ster. 
 Now, the quest ion comes up  
so meti me s,  well , wh at i f
 you di dn't regist er?   
You wer e known be cause in Europe , peopl e carr y 
identi ty cards.  Aft er th
e war  when I  turned 15, I  recei ved an id
entity car d.  As a mat t er of fact , I  
carry one, I still have it, it says, 
stranger.  Born in An
twerp, Belgium, nationa
lity, Rumani
an.  The 
Rumani ans never recognized
 me as a Rumanian national, and th
e Belgi ans didn't re
cognize me as a 
Bel gia n nati onal .  It 's s o met hing I  al wa ys r ese nte d. 
 An d, so wh ether you wa nt
e d to or  not , you wer e 
registered, but you had to officia
lly register.  So, mo m registere
d, everybody did.  
The attitude was  
that, i f you obey t he la w, you'll be
 fi ne.  And, a little late
r on, me n were ca lled up
 for forced labor. 
My mother's youn
gest sister also lived in 
Antwerp.  And she had a little
 boy who was born early in 
1940, a nd her hus ba nd had e sca ped from Pol and.  
He came from Poland 
around, oh some wheres 
around '38, j ust a bout that ti me 
whe n the y got mar r ied.  And my
 uncle  was calle d up.  He went. 
And he ca me bac k thre e  mo nths la
ter.  Many of the me n went an
d the y ca me ba ck t hree mont hs  
later.  And, see?  If we
 obey, if we do what we'r
e supposed to do, it's no
 proble m.  The n, my uncle  
was called up agai n.  My mother 
ha d al mos t  like a sixt h se nse a bout things .  She li ved a l ot by

intuition, but it served her 
well .  She said at one point , she sa
i d, Ale x, I don't know.  I don't t hin k 
you shoul d go.  And he did list en, an
d he took hi s wi fe a nd c hild a nd 
the y esca pe d to Brussel s.  I n  
Brussels it was easier to get lost.  
It had a small, in Sashiel(ph), on
e of the suburbs, it had a Jewish 
communit y, but it wa sn't qu
ite as big or as de fi ned as the  on
e i n Ant wer p.  Ant w erp wa s al most, a  
good pa rt of it was wha t  you cal l al
most like a J ewi sh town.  So, i n
 Br us sels you c ould get lost a 
little bit more.  Then, you know, as ti
me went on, we wore the star, it 
wasn't  any fu n to
 go to school 
wit h the star , but we di dn't have 
to worry about it too long
 because we were told
 you c ouldn't go t o,  
in Ant wer p, you couldn't go t o sc hool
 anymore .  In Brussel s, t h e Je wis h chi l dren were sti ll goi ng t o  
school . 
Q: Wh at, wh at were you doing 
for  money?   For food, or... 
A: M o m worke d.  Mom worke d. 
 She di d s o me dre ss ma king an
d we eac h ha d a job.  I di d 
handwor k, I hemmed.  Because
 lace was hard t o 
obtai n, so you made littl e s
callops on t he bott om of 
slips, on top, we made wo
men's sl ips, so I was i n char ge of t h
e scall ops.  One of 
my sisters wa s in 
char ge of t ur ning, we ma de, mo m ma de, of stra ps . 
 You see, t hings are di
fferent today.  To ma ke 
straps, you ma de kind of a lit tle t
ube and the n you t urne d
 it inside out with a 
sa fety pin, and the n 
you a ttac hed it to the slip, and one of
 my sister s was in charge of tu
rning the straps insi de out .  An d 
then one of us would deliver it, 
because they were piece
me al , t hey were ma de for s o me one a nd t he n 
we  would de liver it , and, she als o 
wor ked in a rest aurant
, be ca use by her worki ng in a r estaurant  we  
wer e abl e to go have dinner there,
 so it helped with th
e food.  She was al ways a ver y hard wor ker , 
even when she came t o t he 
United St ates.  She's a Rock
 of Gi braltar , four  el
even but an incredible 
little lady.  As a matter of fact, sh
e was one of six sister
s and the only one who liv
ed after the war. 
The  di fference bet w een her a nd her sisters , let  me 
just make a comment .  
I was at a conference 
about t w o weeks ago where Lyl e(ph) Hil berg(ph) 
and Yahuda( ph)  Ballo( ph) were  de bati ng whet her

survi val  depended on pure luck or  
whether it was the pers
onal ity of i ndi vi dual s t hat he lped the m t o  
survi ve .  And when I we nt home , I, t hat whol e ni ght
 I thought  about t hat, a nd, of course , I related it  
to our own personal lives, and I real
ized that short of ph
ysically being taken an d killed, a lot of it 
had t o do wi th pe rsonalit y.  Know
ing when to take adva
nt age  of an opport unit y and a c ting upon it  
without too much debate, without too much reflec
tion.  To mo ve, to cons
t a ntly  mo ve.   Mo m w a s 
like that, but  she ha d bee n a rebel wa y bac k.  She  
came from a very r eligi
ous orthodox fa mily i n  
Roma ni a.  She was born in Si get( ph) whi ch is Tra n
sylvania and lived in Ro
ma nia .  And she was t he  
onl y one of six s i ster s who deci de d 
to leave and go to Belgium.  So ther e wa s part of a rebel, not  
someone who is 
going to just sit still a
nd let life lead her.  She eventu
ally brought her 
younger sister  
to Belgium.   And the sa
me t hing happe ned duri
ng the war.  I know 
you wa nt me  to talk  
chronologically, but let me 
jump  ahead a little bit.  
At one point when we 
were going into hiding, 
the proble m you ra n in
to with that was that th
e pe ople  who woul d hi de yo
u, parti cular l y there wa s  
an official , not a n official , a n or ga nize d net wor k in
 Bel gi u m tha t  hid chi l dre n, but  the y c oul dn't tel l  
you where t hey would ta ke the c hildr en to.  Beca us
e i f you were caught , what
 you di dn't know yo u 
coul dn't te ll, shoul d you be
 t ortur ed.  So, t hey di dn 't tell .  M y aunt woul dn
't let her child go, she  
could not bring hersel
f to let him go.  My mom to
ok the risk, we're alive, 
my little cousin is not.  
When my aunt and uncle were alr
eady in our clandesti ne apart ment, 
which they never 
left in more 
than e i ght mont hs, and my mother  begged t he m 
to acc ompany her t o anot her hidi ng pl ace , my 
aunt 's atti tude wa s, there ' s no pl ace t o  run, t hey'll 
find us, wher e are we gonna run?   My aunt is not  
alive, she di ed at Auschwitz, an
d mom li ved.  Because 
mom, that does not mean t hat  mo m coul d 
not have gotten cau
ght, but she still, she kept
 acting, she kept moving an
d trying.  A
nyway, going 
back...

Q: I want ed you t o talk to me a littl e bit more a
bout the vari ous re stricti
ons placed upon Je ws i n  
Antwerp and how you felt about th
at, how it impacted you, your 
school, your play, everything. 
A: Oka y.  We  c oul dn't  go
 to sc hool.  At  one point we c oul dn't
 go t o s c hool.  Actua lly, yea h, we 
were supposed to go to a, Jewish schools were still ope
rating a little bit, but t
echnically, we
 couldn't 
go.  The n J e ws ha d to gi ve up t heir r adios.  Je ws
 had t o give  up t heir bic y
cles.  And there was this 
constant attitude, well, if 
we do what we're told to 
do, a bicycle is very im
portant in Belgium.  I 
mean, peopl e practi call y liv
ed on t hei r bicycles .  But t hat , oka y, 
s o you gi ve up the bic y cles, so you  
give  up t his .  Then, but  there 
wa s, you bec a me ups et, you beca me
 angr y be caus e you c o uldn't  ha ve  
your bic ycle s any more , beca use yo
u coul dn't have radi os a ny more
.  Al so, onc e we star ted weari ng  
the star , we didn't  risk as much 
goi ng out of t he neigh
bor hood.  We didn't live 
i n an official ghetto, 
as they di d i n War sa w a nd Lódz a
nd plac es li ke t hat, in Poland, but
 for  all  pract ical purpos es , onc e  
we wor e  the  star we mig ht as wel l
 ha ve live d in a  ghetto.  Bec ause , you di dn't dare venture out too 
far from home .  You didn't fe
el comf ortabl e.  I f you, for e xa m ple, 
when I wa s, just be f ore I was t ol d  
we c oul dn't go to s chool  anymore,
 I would wear the star
 a nd I would go t o school a nd I'd hold a  
book up sor t  of coveri ng my star
.  And youngste rs  woul
d wal k over a nd pull  aw
a y the book a nd sa y, 
don't you know it 's a cri me t o 
cover  up your sta r ?   Whic h was tr
ue .  It wa s a cri me ,  you we ren't  
supposed t o  cover it up.  But , ev
e n childr en wer e dra wn i nt o that sit uati on, and chil dren c an be  
cruel .  So, i t  did cr eate a l ot of 
disc omfort.  You c o uldn't go t o t he pa
rk anymore, i t  was forbi dden t o 
go t her e.  You c oul dn't go
 to the movies, Je ws were
n't allowed in the movies. 
 You couldn't go to an 
ice cr eam parlor or r est aurants, 
ther e were signs, si gns we nt  up 
di fferent  plac es.  So, you found 
yoursel f sort  of retr eating.  The onl y s aving grace , 
so to speak, that t here wa
s, was  that  y ou wer e n ' t  
alone.  Ot her  kids were in the sa me boat.  Your ne
i ghbors wer e in the sa me s
ituation.  So, that kind, 
and you di d, it was, the feelings were  very stra nge.
  It was, you fo
und yoursel f being very, at that

poi nt, I r e me mber bec o ming ver y unhappy.  And, 
not  under sta ndi ng why.  I kne w what  was  going 
on, but what I couldn't understand is
 t he why.  Wh at di d 
we do?   Why us?   I re
me mb ere d  b e for e  th e  
war , we  wer e  ha pp y,  we  we nt,  we ca me , an d t he n 
all  of a  sudde n, everyt hi
ng c ha nge d, and t hat  i s  
where I  ha d great di ffic ul ty, wit h 
t hat why.  Then there was anothe
r  ele me nt for  us , pe rsonally, at  
that poi nt, mo m got upset  with da d.  He 's i n 
America, he's, wh y did 
he leave us, you know, 
some how t hi nki ng t hat i f  he had be
e n there, he  would ha ve bee n 
okay.  We  would 
have all been 
oka y, whic h we  wouldn't ha ve bee n.  It would have
 probably even been worse.  Fo r the si mple 
reason, being alone, s he ma de all th
e decisi ons, s h e didn't ha ve  to cons ult a nd the r e didn't ha ve to b e  

a discussion as to should 
we, shouldn't we. 
 She decided, an
d we did.  But,
 it was diffic
ult.  My little 
sisters  had e ven gre ater diffi cult y 
wit h  it.  And I found mysel f c onst a
ntl y s aying, don't worry, it 'll  be 
oka y.  It 'll be oka y.  Bec ause t here was cryi ng, w
hy ca n't we go her e, why can't we go there , and 
why can't we do this.  And t he n
 food starte d bei n g a proble m bec aus e J e ws , t he r ationing st a mps  

wer e  st oppe d for  Je ws .  We c oul
dn't ha ve rati oning sta mps .  Now, i f you didn't  ha ve rati oning 
sta mps, you coul dn't buy food.  We
 sti ll ha d a  s mal l advant age.  Mo
m worked in the 
restaurant  as a 
cook.  So, we were abl e to go 
and have a meal there, but  even
 that slowed down because the  
resta urant s had t o start  us ing rati on sta mps, s o t he n
 we  coul dn't have, and t h
en mo m l o st  
her job.   
Q: We re yo u ever turned away from
 anyt hing?   You s aid t ha t  all of
 a sudden you co
uldn't do this, 
you c oul dn't do that ... 

A: Oh, yea h .  I went wit h
 my sister s, after we c o uldn't go to
 school a nymore, I re me mber I we nt, 
re me mber I me ntione d t he pa rk we 
always went  to?  It was at the

Laneke vitz st rak(ph) Park, at the end of our str eet .  I reme mbe r  going wit h  my si sters t o the par k,  

and there wa s a sign, no J ews allo

we wal ke d i n and all of a sudde n 
a guard wa lke d  out of

like t hat.  And I remember 
goi ng...  And I didn't sa y 
anythi ng, I  just re me mber
 going like this, so w e  
had to turn around and g
o.  And my little si
sters were devastated, because we went th
ere every day, 
it was l i ke  natural , it  was  our , quote , our par k.  
You know, that's where we
 had pic nic s on t he  wee k-
ends wi th t h e fri ends and neighbors, t hat 's wher e we
 we nt a fte r school , our  pa

there.  We  used to 
go t o t he movi es, a nd we c oul
dn't go to the mo vi

go get ice cream,  
and we c oul dn't get ic e c r ea m.  So, t h ere were a lo
t of t hings , a nd we star te d fi ndi ng our  way of li fe

 She could not recall his

A: This was, you're going 
into spring, like winter, late

 About this

But that was getting into the spring

  We did make it to Brussels,  
they didn't stop the train, and we

And the r e was a mob of people , there  was a c hec kpo

there was this instant matter of

, we picked a fight. 
And we start ed kic king and scre a ming, pe opl e sta r

_______________
______, so we  di d,
 we left .  And ,  
a mazingly e nough, we ma de it out 
of the  stati o n.  And we caught our

We didn't, it  was a mazi ng, we di dn

that 's what we wante d t o do.  And we did make

stay really where she st ayed becau

  And we found 
a pl ace to stay 
and we took a neighbor into our c

A: I , l et me  give  you a few inci

one day we  were in th

 And I reme mber we 
were st a ndi ng ne ar the wi ndow, looking out , 
and we sa w a group of Blac ks hirt

book st ore, actually the store 
ha d Je wis h books , _______, whic h 
wer e t he prayer shawl s, and all ki
nds of J udai ca.  The  br oke  the  
window, they stormed into that 
shop and I remember them
 pulling out the old 
man who ran it
.  He had a long b
eard, they literally, 
they pulle d a t  the  bear d a nd the y pul
led his si de locks to the side and all that.  And then they threw 
hi m down in the mi ddl e of the street
 a nd I re me mb er they kicke d hi m,
 they literally 
kicke d hi m with 
their boots , a nd I  re me mber we 
stood near the window holding each 
other  a nd sha ki ng, t he t hree  of  
us, we were  just devastat ed.  And we wer e frozen, 
but yet , we stood at  the  
window, looking.  It was  
one of the more difficult 
mo ment s.  The ot her ti me, I re me mbe r  
we  ha d gone for a  walk, beca use  we  
still walked out and, you know, we 
didn't stay confined yet at that
 point, and I re
me mber seeing a 
fire wagons at the big 
synagogue, and there was a crowd of pe
opl e ar ound it.  And I  looke d a nd t he  
synagogue was burning and the, they
 put the fire, they waited, they
 weren't putting the fire out an d 
that 's what I  remember was both

n,  I re me mb er seei ng the fir e me n  
standing and not doing anyt
hing.  And only after a 
while, I saw them go in 
and putting out the fire . 
I didn't learn until after the 
war that they had strict
 orders not to put the 
fire out until the fire 
threat ened the adjoi ning bui
l dings .  But , at that t i me , I di dn't  
know that.  I just

in front of the synagogue and I was

So , b ut b a sic a lly , wh at I  sa w wa s

Q: Now, you, it  sounds

A: No, yea h.  Oka y.  Me , she  tol d. 
 She also let us know, 
all t hree of us, t hat 
i f we di dn't be have a  
certai n way, that we c oul d get hurt .  Basicall y, t hat
 we c oul d ge t hurt .  Lat er on, we lear ned from my  
mother t hat i f we di dn't behave or act  in a certa
in wa y, i f we didn't re me mber our false  na me and 
things like that, that 
we could be taken away 
and killed.  She didn't say 
by whom or how
, but that, 
basic ally, wa s it.  Me , she  
told me mo re, a nd s he s ays t hat  all t he t hings t ha t  I had hear d be fore t h e  
war were tr u e .  Tha t  wa s the first 
ti me  I was, you know, by '41 or s
o, that I starte d learni ng tha t  the  
things that she had said before 
the war t hat t he people wer e exag
gerati ng, that , of cour se, the y  
weren't really exaggerating, you know? 

Q: When you s ay be ha ve  in a certa
i n wa y,  what  d o
es that  mean? 
A: Oka y.  A, to be  very, very go
od.  To ne ver dra w attent ion t o ou

And t he biggest t hing, on
ce we ended up in 
Br ussels , wa s to never forge t  our false  na me a nd t o  
never for get that we were , quote , 
not J ewi sh.  That  we were Chr i stia

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

aske d, I wa s supposed t o say that I ha d alrea dy ha d 
my first communion.  I di

was, but, those ar e basi cally, 
you know, some  of the orders. 
Q: Were  ther e thi ngs you had to lea rn 
at thi s poi nt about bei ng Chr i stia n?  
A: Not yet.  Not yet.  Not in 
Br us sels.  That wa s only i f  we were a ppr oac hed.  But no on e  
appr oac he d us.  As long as we re
me mb ere d ou r false na me, at  this 
point we wer e okay, beca use we  
were still living in a very secular wo
rld.  But, we weren't really out,
 once we got to Brussels, except 
for th e fe w wee ks t hat we we nt to
 s chool a nd ba ck to t he a pa r t me n
t , and j ust going ba ck, we didn't 
really move around t oo mu
ch.  The onl y other pl ace th
at we went was to a hou
se that was across t he 
street from t he school where 
mom had gott en a job wor king as 
a housekeeper .  Because by now  
things ar e getting ver y diffi cult .  There was no pl
ace to r eall y  wor k any mo
re.  Don't  forget , this 
wasn't Ant w erp where she 
was sewi ng and wor ki ng at t he r est aura
nt.  Onc e we got to Brussel s, she  
coul dn't r eal ly work le
gally anymore.  So , she cleane d the ho
use  for  these  pe opl e.
  And, but t hat,  
you know, t hings di dn't last, it wa sn
't that, i t  onl y laste d a fe w we
e ks a n d the n what happe ned i s,  
aft e r my, Charlotte , it wa s the mi ddl e one , it was a l wa
ys Charlotte for so me reason.  Charlotte had a 
fi ght with this child in sc
hool, we lea r ned t hat , lat er on, that e v
en t he instr uctor s at the school wer e  
worried about this child.  Becaus
e when t his chil d sai d
 s o me, I 'll get my brot her on you, ther e wa s  
good r eas on.  Her br othe r  was a Bel g
i an Na zi.  Everyone  in sc hool was  
a fr aid of her .  The principal ,  
one day, sa id to me, Flora , as k your
 mother to come to school.  And 
by then I said th
e other kids had 
already had gotten these slips of pa
pe rs and I late r  learne d wha t  it sa
id.  For  example, t h ey got them 
on a  Frida y and the y wer e, t he paper basic ally sai d, 
t old the  parent s or  whoever were  t he guar dia ns ,  
that on the Monda y foll owi ng t his
 Friday, I ha ve no date to gi ve 
you here, you know, al l I re me mber  
is it was a Friday, they were to 
report to a not her school .  To t h
e best of my knowledge, those 
childr en reported, but  ne ver c a me home
.  I  ha ve  no docume ntation of th
at .  Tha t 's  wor d of mouth .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
25 
 
That  is what  I lear ned.
  And when mo m came t o 
school, her first reacti on 
was, and my r eacti on  
when the principal told me this
, wel l , we didn't do anything, we 
were good, be caus e they neve r  
called par ent s to school .  See, 
there was no thing abou
t parent -t eachers associ
ation, you didn't have 
that over t here.  When 
a pare nt wa s c alled to sc hool, it wa s be
caus e a  c hild did not be have .  So, my  
reacti on was, well , we're 
good, my sisters ar
e good, we didn't 
do anythi ng.  And she says, no, I  
know you di dn't do a nyt hin
g, I want to tal k to mo m.  So, whe n, 
meanwhile, just pr
ior to that, also, 
all that was happening with
in those same weeks, she realized  that
 we di dn't ha ve reall y war m wint er  
coats.  So, she had made arrangem
ents for us to receive a winter 
coat and also recei ve a glass o f 
mil k every day.  Tha t  wa s like for poor chil dre n, but 
what we didn't know is 
that t hose winter coats 
and t he mil k  came fr om an
 industriali st, Msr. Rausank(ph).  He
 was t he pa tron, we didn't have, as I  
said, par ent- teacher associ ations, but  what you had is patrons 
of the school .  And which a ri ch  
industrial ist or a not her  wealthy i ndi vi dual  would t a
ke a s chool  under  the i r 
patrona ge and gi ve  poor  
childr en clot hing, vita mi ns, all kind
s of thi ngs.  So Msr . Ra us ank( ph)  
happened to be 
the patron of 
the sc hool, ________
______, wher e we were goi
ng to.  And when 
mom c a me to sc hool, of c our se ,  
her first reaction, too, wh
en I tol d her the pri nci pal  wanted t o 
s ee her was , what di d you do?   I said, 
mamma, we didn't do an
ything.  And I answered 
for my two little children because they didn't do  
anyt hing.  So, s he di d go to sc ho

t  with M sr. Raus ank( ph) , a nd he, 
I think it's time fo r th
e c hildre n to be  hi dde n. 
Q: Now, before we go into that 
chapter, I just have 
a couple additional que
stions.  Wh en, after 
movi ng to Bruss els, di d you ev
er have  oc casi on to go ba ck to
 Antwerp, what
 was that...

A: Okay.  I s hould ha
ve mentioned that earlier.  
Once we got  to Brus sels , at 
fi rst, when Carl tol d us 
to leave, mom r eacted, li ke I said, put a double la
yer of clothi ng on us, we 
took off, we ended up, 
and we made it safely to
 Brussels.  Once we
 were settled in Brussels, it 
was, I don't even know, I 
think it was no more than ab
out 48 hours l ater , or  some
thing like that.  It was 
withi n a day or so.  I f 
eve n the s a me  ni ght , I  don't re me mb
er t he exact  ti me peri od, at t his
 poi nt .  I ' m getti ng old a nd my 
me mory i s starting to go.  That 's
 why I 'm gla d we 're doing this, i n
 a wa y.  She sai d, Flori ka(ph) ,  
you're goi ng bac k to Antwer p, you'
r e goi ng t o war n e verybody.  Y
ou're  goi ng t o tel l  the m tha t  
something's going to happen
.  And, I didn't want to 
go.  She says, 
my attitude was,
 why don't you 
go?   She s ays, you'r e a  c hild, you 
c an go.  You don't  ha ve  an i dentit
y car d.  You see , c hildre n di dn't  
wal k ar ound wit h ide ntit y car ds 
unle ss the y wer e  Je wish and wore
 the star.  She says, you'll go, 
you'll t ell everybody that 's s o met h
ing's going to happen and then 
you'll come back.  So , the one 
thing, we al wa ys obe yed.  My moth
e r , we di d not  disobe y my mother , 
e ver .  Of course , if we c ould  
help it, but, we did obey
.  And I went .  I  went .  
I t ook the trai n, I we nt 
bac k to Ant we r p, and I was  
looking for someone to tell them. 
 The stre ets in the nei ghbor hood 
were extremely quiet.  I didn't 
see anybody in the st reet s, the shops wer e quiet.
  I wal ked around, I sa
w nobody.  And I started  
fe eling very fri ght ene d.  I  wa nte d to l e ave a nd go
 back t o Brussels.  Howe
ver, how could I go back 
to Br ussels without telling some bo
dy?   I had to obe y a nd ful fill  wha t
 mo m ha d t old  me  to  d o.   A s  I 
wa s walki n g on t he st reet, t her
e was one str eet th
at was called the, 
I believe it was the  
La mi nere str att(ph), I wa s walki ng, it  wa s start i ng
 to get t o wards eve ning, and I wa s always ver y 
afraid of the dark.  I still am.  An
d I saw it getting betwee
n day and night and I sa
id, I really want to  
go ba ck, but  I di dn't do 
what I  was  s u ppose d t o do.  And whil e  
I wa s wal ki ng and debat i ng what  to 
do, I hear a knock near t he bottom 
of my feet.  And I 
look down a nd I see a 
hand s aying...it wa s  
some one  who was  relat e d to
 us, l i ke  a di stant  c ousins  and r ela tiv
es who were i n, down near  that, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

was like a cellar window, like one 
of those little cellar windows.  
I knew how to get into that  
buil ding.  I we nt down t wo house s a
nd we nt in a nd I ma de my way dow
n to that cellar.  There were 
sever al pe ople hole d up t here .  And t hey s aid, wh
at are you doing here?   I thought you left .  And I  
said, wel l , ma mma sent me 
back t o tell ever ybody to leave.  Th
at s o met hi ng's goi ng t o  happen.  She 
says, you're a little bit late.  Wh
at had happene
d is, just shortly after we
 left , ________________  
came in with trucks and they e mp
tied several of the street
s.  That, there were pe
ople, there were still 
Je ws in Ant wer p, but t h at qua rter, e xce pt for pe opl
e t hat the y mi sse d, li ke 
those people that they 
mis se d.  So, I sai d t o t h e m, wel l , you better come 
with me.  And they sai
d, no, we  ha ve food for  
sever al we eks.  And there '
s no pla ce t o go.  We 'll  just sta y pu
t.  See, there was 
that, you know, you 
had s ort of a  mixe d ba g, you know
, peopl e s ay, why did J ews go l i ke
 sheep to the slaughter?  They  
didn't go like sheep to the slaughter.  But there 
wer e people  who did be come paralyzed, that 's the  
onl y wa y I  can de scri be  it.  I f  th
ey became paraly
zed li ke, we can't , wher
e ar e we  going t o go?  
There was, there was a pani c that set in, that kind
 of par alyz ed the m.  Th
ere was like a disbelief 
also.  Be cause her e you, don
't forget , Bel gium was a 
very free country.  You were able to walk on 
the street  and say, I 'm 
a Jew.  I mean, very to
lerant, the Belgian govern
ment pai d for parochial  
schools be t hey Je wis h, be they Ch
ri stian, Cathol ic, Prote sta nt , what
ever .  See, but 
in that country, 
even though you did have
 the fascists, you did 
ha ve t hose  compone nt s, but  on t h e whole, the 
country was a comfortabl e place for 
peopl e of any religi on t o li ve in. 
 So, a  l ot of pe opl e did bec o me  
sort of, li ke I  
said, paralyzed. 
Q: And that wa s your
 sense at  the ti me? 
A: That was my sense at  the ti me
, ri ght .  I  was f r ustrat ed, I r e me
mbe r  be ing frust rate d.  Oka y?   I 
reme mb er I said, no, ma mma said you've got to come. 
 Yo u have to come.  S
o, and I, like I felt like 
I couldn't leave, they were like, they were up
se tti ng me , I  wa s act uall y ge tting upset because I  was

supposed to tell them that 
the y have  t o lea ve .  And, t he y di dn't, 
I l e ft myse lf.  Took
 the train, went 
bac k t o Br us sels. 
Q: Di d you have any s ense at t he ti
me, eit her i n Antwerp or Br ussel s
, what the Christian response t o  
all of this was? 

A: Not yet.  Not yet.  No, no.  That part was, 
don't forget, out of my  real
m.   And there was, you 
know, ther e wa s not that  kind of a c onta ct.  No. 
 We lived in a narrow me
ntall y, for us the wor l d  
beca me ver y  narrow.  You know. 
 I f mo m ha d a sens e of what th
e Chri st ian worl d'
s reaction was, 
except for  the i mmediate pe
ople  that  you de alt wit h , I  don't know 
i f  s he  eve n kne w  ye t a t  that  ti me . 
Q: You know, just for clar
ity, I wanted to date this
 ti me  period.  This  was  l ate s pri ng of '42?  
A: This was like very late
 spri ng, like  t oward the 
e n d of t he sc hool year . 
Q: Of 1942?  

A: '42, correct. 

Q: Oka y.  So, why don't you continue . 
A: Okay. By August of that year
, we , M sr. Raus onk(ph) had come
, actually in June yet, Msr . 
Ra usonk(ph)  had c o me into the pi ctur e and he i m me
diate l y made arr ange me nts .  A, he gave mom a 
job i n the fac t ory.  He ma de fal se doc u ment s for mo
m.  He took me into this
 home, my sister, one of 
the m we nt t o his  br othe r 's home
, the third one went to his s
ecr etar y, and he start e d ma kin g  
arrange me nt s to hide  us  i n a c onv
ent of the Fr anci scan nu
ns i n Doel, D- O- E-L.  The Fle mis h part of 
the countr y.  He ha d a c ousi n who 
al so this past spring rec eived
 posthumously, the me dal and the  
title, Just of the Nations 
fr om _______________ in 
Israel.  So, he 
made arrangements
 with her to 
hide  us.  Doel was  a ver y s ma ll t o wn
.  I t was, it 's a one street  t own, 
in fac t , I 've gone ba ck t here  a nd  
I 've onl y a ft erwards , real ized how s m all it really wa
s.  One si ngle str eet and one cross street, that 
wa s about it.  It was a conve nt of 
Franciscans, nuns, it had been a boar
di ng school .   But, there wer e

no chil dre n now be cause  of the wa r. 
 And since it was right near the sea,
 sort of in the line of battle,  
there  were no kids.  There was al so one  outp
ost, one Ge r ma n out post, one  c hur ch.  M sr .  
Ra usonk(ph) took us there person
ally.  Well, first, as I said
, I st aye d i n his home and... 
Q: Okay.  I wa nt y
ou t o tell me a bout  the tri p ther e.  Li ke
, how much did you and 
your sister s know 
at thi s poi nt about where  you wer e goi ng and 
what, you know, wh at 
wa s ha ppe ning and... 
A: You know, it was al most like a 
fog.  We kne w we had t o  be hi
dden.  We kne w 
that some body 
could take us away and k
ill us, although the word kill us was very
 vague.  We  knew 
that if we mad e  
the slightest mistake, if we disobe
ye d, i f we made nois e  whe n we we
r e s uppos ed to be quiet , i f we 
cried, we woul d not be take n car e of.  And the n  
all the se ba d thi ngs ca n happe n to us.  And the 
words e ve n bad t hings , wa s prett y, it  was vague .  
Bec ause, you know, whe n you'r e a child, e ven t he  
work kill  or  t ake n a wa y a nd ba d t hings ca n, it 's 
something that frightens yo
u, but you don't have t ha t  
clear c onc ept.  I ha d it a nd I didn't have it .  I kne
w I had t o prote c t my s i sters fr om a ll thes e ba d 
things.  I ha d to ma ke s u re that the y didn't be tray 
themsel ves, that they di dn't acci dent ally say their  
real name.  Or say that 
they weren't Christian.  But, it wasn't
 that, okay, the Ge
stapo will 
take me, 
they will take me to the 
camp, they will gas me, th
ey will, you know, I didn
't know, we just knew 
this global concept, we'
ll be taken away, we'll be 
killed, bad things will happe
n to us.  Bu
t, nobody 
really knew yet.  Yet. 
Q: Di d you put up a fi
ght at all  about l eavi n
g your  mother , or ... 
A: No, it wa s, you know, th
is is some thing we talk 
a bout, my sisters a nd I, 
to t his  da y.  The wa y,  
you know, beca use  I l o ok at my 
gr andchil dre n, and my own c hild
ren when they were raised, I 
mean, just to make, to get them
 to even eat or do homework some
ti mes, you know, is a little battle , 
when t hey want to wat ch TV and 
all .  And, I l ook at the m, and I 
say, I ha ve a gra nds on who, one i s  
married, one's this 13, he will cel
ebrate his Bar Mitzvah January 1, 
and I look at them,  and I say, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

can't believe  how young th
ey are i n compari son t o how ol d we 
were at that time
, without knowing 
precisely.  No, we did not, even the little one, even
 the little one, was so we
ll behaved.  
Although, I 
did ha ve to pinc h her  a l ot.  To 
get  her to beha ve .  She  had a habit  
of biting and I ha
d to constantl y  
tell her, don't bite someone because they're going 
to send us awa y.  Don't screa m, t he y 're going t o  
send us a wa y.  Don't cr y, the y 'r e goi ng to s end us
 away.  Don't ask for mo
re food, the y 'll se nd us  
away.  And we  knew that
 we couldn't  a fford to be  sent  
away.  That wa s 
very import ant. 
Q: You had a lot of
 responsibility for 
an 11 year old. 
A: Yes , it 's a ma zing I 'm halfway nor mal.  Someti
mes I thi nk a b out it a nd I s ay to mysel f , you know,  
I mi s s, the one thi ng that  I do mi ss is  havi ng ha d 
some fri vol ous light yea r
s.  I a m younger t oda y 
than I wa s then.  Becaus e when I ca
me to the United States
 a t  16, I wa s ol d.  An
d I look at 16 year 
olds and I sa y, they're s uc h ba bies
.  They'r e such ba bies .  And I r e
me mbe r ed I  was ha nde d a piec e of  
paper to sign to vote for two people
, whi ch one do I like be st?   Frank Sinat r a, Perry Como.  I didn't  
eve n know who t hey we re.  And wh
en I lear ned what it was the kids 
wa nte d me t o si gn, I said, what 
kind of st upi dity, don't th
ey know any better?  They
 were  babie s, I  was  isola ted.  I  was a very lonel y  
teenager . 
Q: I want to get to that 
later, but I just, it 
must have been
 hard having responsib
ility for your
 sisters. 
A: It was!  But, I di dn't think a b
out it.  I just knew this
 is what mo m ha d tol d 
me to do.  And I ha ve  
to do it.  And it wa
s s o mething t hat I had, wa s doi ng alrea dy,
 from t he ti me  that  I was  li ke s eve n and 
a hal f, ei ght .  Because fr om my earli est recoll ecti ons
, what I hear d constantly
 was, don't be such a 
child.  Go take car e of the chil dren
.  Don't be s uc h a chil d.  Or don't
 be a child.  So, I ,  I was not a  
child .  It wa s  my mo m a n d 
me a nd t he  kids .  And t hat 's the wa y 
it went .  And eve n as adults, it was  
mo m a nd me  and t he  ki ds . 

Q: Any thoughts  a bout your  fat h
er at this point? 
 Or  he  was  re ally i n the  ba ckgr ound?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
31 
 
A: By now, we weren't really thin
king about hi m.  I me an
, at fir st the r e was, a nd t here  was anger .  
We  di dn't, t h ere was r eall y no rea son t o be angry,
 but , you s ee ,  we didn't kn
ow that he was going to 
jump shi p.  The  aunt her e ha d tal k
e d hi m int o doi ng t his .  He had no
 intention of not coming back. 
As it turned out, there was,
 for hi m it was the be
st thing, but  he  had no int e
ntion.  But he was talked  
into it and the attitude was,
 well, you come an
d we'll i mmediately 
take Fanny and the 
kids.  But, of 
cour se, by t h e ti me  he  rea lized that  he coul dn't 
get Fanny and the 
kids here, the war started and the 
rest is hi stor y.  But , ther e wa s anger  beca use I t h
ink we all have to las h  out at s o mebody.  So, 
whenever we did go, before we 
even went into hiding, when we
 were still togeth
er, I remember  
ma mma  gett ing ups e t many ti me s.  And, where she 'd 
la sh out, s ure , he 's  sa fe, but you know, a n d ,  
you know, we ha d, es peci ally wh
en she had some r eal di fficult t i m
e s, so, you know, yea h, t here  was  
anger.  M y a nger  la sted e ven a fte r t h
e war when I came to
 the United States. 
Q: We 'll get  to t hat...so, I  think you we re 
begi nni ng to tel l  me  
how you got  t o Doel?  
A: Doel, right. We  stayed
 no more  than about  t wo,
 two and a half mo nths.  
Q: How was the trip getti
ng ther e, was that easy? 
A: Okay, the  trip getti ng t here .  Msr . Ra usonk(ph
)  got a littl e fl atbe d truck a nd, it 's a mazi ng beca use  
later on we we nt t o hidi ng plac es 
and we went  openl y by trai n, but  I 
gues s he  must ha ve bee n re all y  
fri ght ene d at  this poi nt , it  wa s probabl y hi s firs
t  experience even doing t h
is, although he  wa s wi t h  
the Resistance, so I'm sure he 
was involved in ma
ny other actions.  He got 
a little flatbed truck, took 
some veget a ble crate s wi th, those wo
ode n crate s, fai r ly lar ge, and put 
eac h  of us under a crate.  He  
then surrounded them and 
topped them with cr
ates that were filled with 
vegetables and fruits.  And 
when he wa s stoppe d at  a chec kpoi nt, well , bec aus
e we had strict orders , not a s ound, unles s he  
stops the truck to let us go
 in the field, ta ke c are of our physi cal
 nee ds or t o give  us  some  food a nd a 
drink.  At a chec kpoint , he sa id 
especially when the truck stops, 
not  a s ound.  And, I r e me mbe r  a t  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

one of the c hec kpoints , we ha
d stopped and I heard hi m as k fo
r doc uments which wa s sta nda r d  
proc edure.  No matter where you 
we nt, at any c o rner, any s p ot, yo
u ca n be as ke d for  doc ume nts . 
So, that was not hing unus ual.  He
 wa s aske d for hi s  docume nt s and I 
know t hey were in order , and I 
remember hearing, 
what  have you got there on the truc k.  
He sa id, we ll, you ca n see, I 've got  
vegetabl es , and I re me mber hear
i n g like knoc king on t he c r ates , bu
t we didn't make a sound.  I 
always tell kids whe n I talk to the m, t he one thing I re me mber, and it 's a ma zing the wa y you retai n  
somet hing.  I  ha d a tic kle  
in my t hroat.  And, I re
me mber  thi nki ng that  i f  I don't c ough a nd clear  my  
throat , that I wa s goi ng t o  choke to 
death.  But I al so knew that  if I 
cle are d my t hr oat a n d I made t he 
slightest s ound, Msr . Ra usonk( ph) w
oul d be ca ught , the n we  would be
 c aught.  So I  held out.  I  
survi ve d, appare ntly.  I used t o, whe n
 I taught , I used t o ma ke the kids  
do t hat i n cla ss .  And I 'd sa y, 
you know, s ee i f you ca n hol d out a 
mi nute .  It 's  good e xer cis e.  But,
 anywa y, t hat 's how he  dr ove us 
to Doel .  And that 's how 
he took us back t o Brus s els t wo a nd 
a hal f mont hs late
r when the Mother  
Superi or wa s  a frai d t o kee p us. 
Q: So, de scri be your arrival at
 this convent,
 if you wo uld. 
A: Oka y.  We got t her e, we were l et into a parl or
 and we were left in th
e parlor wit h  the nun and 
Msr. Raus onk(ph) took l eave of us 
a nd he le ft.  I ha d a fe eli ng t hat
 he mi ght ha ve staye d t o sa y 
goodbye t o his c ous in or  somet hin
g, but I don't know.  Bu
t, he took leave of 
us and he le ft.  And 
we're sitting in this parlor with th
e nun and all of a sudd
en Betty, the youngest, 
looks up at the wal l  
and s he see s  a c ros s.  And, whic h 
we  had se en on chur ch
es, but we had strict 
or der s  we  wer e  never 
to walk into a church or anythi
ng.  So, I knew really very little ab
out Christianity.  I knew there was  
a cross and t hat ther e someone by th
e na me of Je sus Chri st on the 
cross .  Why, what , when, I kne w 
absolutely nothing about.
  And, I knew that Christian child
r en went t o chur ch on Sundays an d 
Je wish c hildren went to synagogue on the Sa bbat h. 
 But, I don't re me mbe r  even thi nki ng about t he  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
33 
 
why's t oo much at t hat t i me because
 I associ ated mostl y wit h  the 
Jewish children, 
even though I 
kne w s o me of the chil dr en in school
, Christian children.  So, she look
s up and she says, what 's t hat?  
And the nun looks ki nd of stra nge ly
 at her a nd s he sa ys , of c ours e
, I ' m Fl e mi sh, you know, why,  
that's our Lord on the cr
oss, my little one.  Sure 
you know, and do you have 
that at home?  And she  
looks, and me anwhile, I starte d ki
c king, l uckil y there wa s a  tablecl ot h, I  starte d kic k ing her unde r 
the table.  And s he di dn't  ma ke 
a move to listen to me.  So then
 I pinched her and she  says , stop 
hurti ng me!  And, I ' m li ke, 
dyi ng.  And I sa ys , oka y, we 're l ost.  
I didn't say it, I thought it.  An d 
Charlotte was just si
t ting quietl y.  Cha r lotte was ve ry, ver y qui
et.  But, Betty was 
a rebel.  That was 
the youngest .  And, t he nun s ays, well
, I 'm sur e  you ha ve t hat a t  home
.  And she sa ys , 
no, we don't. 
She s ays, we ll, what do you ha ve?   She says , I don' t know what  you call it , i f you gi ve me a penci l  
and paper, I'll show you.  And she 
made t he most  bea uti fu
l Jewish star.  We ll, 
I thought , that 's it,  
you know.  The nun jumps out of he
r  seat , runs out of t he parl or, a n
d, I me an, l eaves t h e door wi de 
ope n, t w o minute s late r we see t w o nuns c o ming, I 
found out  later one was 
Si ster Adonia( ph), t he 
other one wa s the Mother  Superior , ar gui ng loudl y, ch
a os br oke out .  And, I learne d late r, of cours e ,  
in retrospect, I learned later fr om 
Sister Adonia(ph), I didn't learn this
 until after the war, fr om Sister  
Adoni a(ph), that she was the only 
o n e  that kne w we were Je wis h ch
il dre n.  She kne w, but she told 
the Superior and M sr. Ra usonk( ph) 
had, of course , I gue ss, i ns t ructe d her t o say s o met hing, that we  

wer e chil dre n of a pris oner of 
wa r whose mot her had got ten ill , and who j us t  needed a pl ace to sta y  
until our mother got well.  But they
 were not told.  She lied, actuall
y, to her own Mother Superior. 
Wh ich, you know, for a nun
, so, I was, until 1993, 
I was under the impressi
on that the reason we  
wer e se nt a w ay was  be ca use Be tty bet r aye d us.  In 
1993, I found out di fferently
.  Thi s lit tle nun here  
told me .  She, in 1993, I 
visited with her, I said to
 her, I s aid, Siste r  Rober t a, I sai d, it 's  a sha me we  
coul dn't sta y  wi th you.  
If only Betty hadn't betrayed
 us.  She s ai d, Betty ha d not
hing to do 
with it, it

 Roberta and Siste r Adonia(ph) took care of us.  
They crocheted little sli
ppers for us because we wore the 
wooden clogs, an
d what you would  
usually do is, you w
ould walk into them 
with the little, like a little sli
pper and then when you get to  
the front door, you just walk out 
i nto the hous e.  You di dn't walk
 in with the shoes.  They, I

I knew catechism better  
than I knew Judaism,  so. 

Q: Were you, were ther

A: Not in that particular conven

 My name is Jew.  S

actually, I submitted it in a French cl

and it got an A,
 but that's not  
the i ssue. 

Q: Di d you have  any cont act
 wit h your  mot her duri ng this  t wo mont h peri od?  
A: Not , no, not dur ing tha t  ti me a t
 all.  The next time 
that we sa w mot her is wh en M s r. R a us on k(p h )  
took us bac k  the sa me wa y that we ca me .  And, s o  we did s pend some ti me 
wit h mo m a gain .  An d it 
was then that, apparently, Father 
Bruno came into the pict
ure.  Although, then 
I still did not know  
that he was  in the pict ure.  We  were hi dde n a fte r that , we  were hidde n in a , an orpha na ge in 
Ethe rbi g(ph) .  Et herbi g( p h) is  a 
suburb of Brussels.  A borough of 
Brussels.  And, it was with the 
Sisters of St. Joseph.  What I didn'
t know until after I was 
there for awhile is th
at some of the nuns 
were not really nuns, they were 
young Jewish wo men dressed as nuns
.  Who wer e al so be ing hidde n 
there.  We wer e there for, I ' m 
not  s ure i f  it was  seve n or ei ght 
mo nths.  There wa s a leak, how the 
leak took pla ce or what
, I don't  know.  All I know is that
 we , we  did  lea v

Q: Can you describe your a

 your  i mpre ssi ons wer e... 
A: Okay.  The or pha na ge, the r e we

There mo m was able t o come onc

me  s o me bre a d.  The  br e a d duri ng 
the war was not really 
good, it  was  like , thi ck, hea v y br ead a nd 
the first da y it al mo st taste d like cla y.  Ca use I don't  know, a s the  war progre s sed, they use d all kind s

of things to make bread go furt
her.  The second day it got a little 
chewier, the third day it started 
havi ng mol d  on it , but we ate it a
nywa y.  And, we also, our  brea d 
there was also ra
tioned in the, 
when I  sa y r ationed, we got a  cer
t ain porti on a da y.  And what  I w
oul d do i s, I woul d hold the bre ad  
for my sisters an
d myself to make sure that
, because the little ones woul
d eat up their bread right 
away and t h en t hey would cr y t hey
 wer e hungr y.  And I wouldn't ha
ve a n ythi ng to gi ve the m, so I  
held the br ea d a nd I gave  the m bit s of  it at  a ti me
.  And there was a lot of 
steali ng a mongst  the ki ds  
fr om each other of the br
ead and, I remember, 
like, at night, I would have
 the bread under my pillow  
but I couldn't slee p beca use some bo
dy woul d al wa ys c o me and t r y t o
 st eal your bre ad fr om und e r  
your pi llow.  And I r e me mb
er we al so had terri ble, we wer e 
packed with lice.
  And Bett y, t he  
youngest , ha d the se bi g s ores on her 
head because the lice got
 under her s kin and c aus ed i n fecti ons.  
And, what I also had to do is, I wa
s, I took the lice, as 
much as I could, and th
e little, they were like, 
I don't know if you call them nits or whatever, th
e little eggs that, they ge t stuck on, they get like 
stuc k on t he hair, a nd you have to act
ually, you can't just take them o
ff, they, it's al
most like they're  
cemented on, you have to 
literally hold the hair
 and pull them off.   And th
en we'd crac
k them.  And 
I took the m out of my si s t er 's head
, but I coul dn't really ta ke my own out.  So, I woul d pay a bit e of  
bread, I  would measur e it , my t hu m
b, fr om here t o  here, one pi ece 
of br ead, for ever y ten lice they 
took out of my hair.  But, they 
had t o show the m  to me .  Or ten, as I call e d the m the n, nits.  Like  
little eggs.  So, this is, there I wo
rked, I had to he
lp with peeling potatoes, 
I would steal some potato 
skins, you know, a nd I didn't k
now t hey had bec o me a deli ca cy 
some pla c e, it was just , you know, 
snea k some  awa y to e a t, and I ha d t o hel p wit h 
the younger kids .  We bathe d like i n  a tub the y 
would fill wi th water.  Bu
t like, we would stand i n 
line and we'd each go in 
and wash and then step 
out and t he next  ki d got  
into that same water. 
 And I  had a  proble m, Ch
arlot te was al ways ver y 
fussy, t hat 's the middle one.  An
d I r e me mbe r  she didn't wa nt  to 
go i n, a n d she got 
punished, so I

force d her t o  go in be cause I didn't want her t o ge
t puni she d.  And the n, t h ere were rats  there.  So, 
this was a very, it wasn't 
a gr eat plac e .  I  di d go ba ck beca us e 
t here was one nun, 
an older nun, who 
wa s tryi ng t o be a s good to us as s h e could.  Bu
t, see , they had pr obl e ms,
 too.  They coul dn't ge t  
enough food.  I me an, 
wa r bri ngs all  kinds  of
 problems, you know?  
Q: What a bout t he other kids , 
I  me an, di d you ma ke frie nds?  
A: Ok ay , we ll, in t hat , se
e, there were mi xed groups 
there.  There were Chr is
tians and J ewi sh kids . 
And it wa s a n or pha na ge, but it was 
al so an or phanage for di ffi cult ch
ildren.  So, ther
e was a lot of  
punishi ng.  I  re me mber a  lot of pu
nis hing, a l ot of kids who didn't 
be ha ve, it wa sn't a very, toilets  
wer e being, over f lowi ng a
ll the ti me , you ha d all  
that , you know, s me lly 
water and, 
I remember 
there was a court yar d i n the cent er 
of it and when I we nt back to se
e  i f my  me mor y,  I,  ever ythi ng  I  
re me mb ered ,  I we nt b a c k  to co n fir m t hat my me
mory served me well, an
d it di d se rve me be tter  
than I e ven had eve r  dr ea med it woul d.  Not t hat
 I want t o reme
mber all of it.  There was a  
court yar d, there was an a
pple  tree  in t hat c ourtyar d.  And I re me
mber  see i ng t he  apple s and I  used to 
die for one.  So, we trie d once i n 
awhile to sneak in, but we had to
 cli mb a prett y bi g fe nce and it  
had t hes e pointed posts , i t  wa s lik
e a regul ar meta l fe nce .  And we
 couldn't really, comforta bly ge t  
over it.  One kid once got over an
d st ole an apple and thr e w it  over  
to us, but she co
uldn't get back 
over , so s he  was ca ught  and we got  punis he d.  It was di ffic ult, but we wer e sa fe , that was the  
i mport ant  thi ng. 

Q: Now,  were you distingu
ished as Jews?  Did anyone
 know you were Jewish? 
A: No, no.  We wer e  no
t distinguished.  We were just all th
e  kids.  Nobody sai d, you're Jewish, 
you're t his .  No.  We we re ther e,
 peri od.  I mea n, whate ver we nt o

Q: But, the other kids didn't ne
cessarily know you were Jewish? 
A: No.  No.  We  ha d our 
fal se na me , we wer e al ways , nobody told
 anybody.  
As I sa id, I  didn't e ve n 
know that some nuns were
n't really, weren't nuns, 
you know, until afterwards. 
Q: Di d you have  any fun t here?  
A: No.  No.  The onl y t hing is , 
M sr. Ra us onk(ph) ca me  to se e us
 once , a nd Fat her  Bruno ca me .  
That was the first time I had met 
Father Bruno.  But, I didn't know 
he wa s Fat her Br
uno t hen.  He  
wa nte d to know i f we wer e bei ng t ake n care of

Q: Anyt hi ng else  a bout t h

A: Ther e was a rai d once, t here

ortly after that that we left, 
beca use I t hi nk there wa s a relati ons hip bet wee n the, bet wee n that day a nd, t here wa s somet hin g 

else, for the life  of me , 
I can't recall it right now.  I just can't  recall. 
Q: So, you really didn't, you di
dn't establish fr iendships, you 
t ook c are of your  sist ers ... 
A: Period.  Right.  As I 
say, we we re  with e ver ybody, ye t we wer e
 isol ate d.  I f that ma kes a ny se ns e.  
We  di dn't s hare .  You di
dn't confide.  You 
c onstantl y wer e  a ware  tha t  you c oul dn't  talk or  tell  
anybody.  That was basi cally it .  You can't tell 
a nybody who you ar e.  And 
ma ke sur e that your 
sisters never tell.  And that was 
a not her thi ng that kept  me  a wa ke,
 is because I wa
s always worried 
that maybe i n their dream, i f they
 woke up, the y would acci d entall y 
gi ve us a wa y.  Well, with Bett y 
I ran int o some, I don't remember 
the  exa c t ti me , but , I r e me mber one  
time  she said, I don't wa nt to 
use thi s prete nd na me a nymore.  Beca use we told 
her we wer e goi ng to ha ve a pretend na me.  I don't  
wa nt to us e it, I wa nt my na me . I sa id, well, y
ou got your na me , you got  
Betty.  No, I want my 
whole na me .  And she  sa ys, I don't 
want to pretend anymore, I don't 
want t o pla y prete n d any more.

I says , well , if you don't play pr
etend, the boogie ma n's 
going to come and scra
tc h your eyes out a nd 
tear your  hai r out and he 's going to
 r e ally hurt you, so you bett er ke
ep playi ng prete nd.  That  was t he  
onl y ti me that I recall t h at I ever had repri ma nd her 
for that.  The other things
 I ran into is mostly  
because she would get into trouble 
with a dult s.  Bec ause i f , s he ha
d a ha bit that i f you got a ngr y 
wit h her , re me mber I sa id she bit, s he woul d bi
t e, I guess it wa s her onl y de fe nse , a nd s he woul d 
always get punis he d.  So, I tried to pre vent her from
 biti ng, so I sort of ke pt  const antl y wat chi ng he r  
to ma ke  sure  she behave d. 
Q: To your knowledge, we
re t here  a ny ot her Je wis h  chil dre n t he r e with you?  
A: Yeah.  I  l earne d l ater  on th
at  there  wer e s eve ral.  But ,
 I don't  know who t h ey are. 
Q: Do you reme mb er what you were... 

A: Unle ss I l ook at  Father  Br uno's li st.  Yo
u know, there were some  names there, but... 
Q: ______________?  

A: Yeah, right. 
Q: Do you re me mber  wha t  yo
u were  thinki ng about  or dr
eami ng about at t he t i me?  
A: No, I jus t  kept worrying a bout 
my sist ers.  That was it .  You 
se e, you got to re al ize, I had a  
mandate.  Okay?  When I 
l e ft , w h e n  we l e ft  t o  g o  
into hiding, here was th
e mandate.  My mother  
said, make sure the kids don't 
betray themselves.  She never sa
id, make sure you don't betra y  
yoursel f.  M ake s ure t he  kids , whi ch, of c our se , 
wa s incl usi v e, ma ke s ur e the kids don't bet r ay 
the mse lve s.  Make sur e they don'
t give themselves away.  Two, ma
ke sure they remember they'r e  
Jewish.  Three, if the Gestapo ge
ts me and I don't come back afte
r the war, find your father in 
Ameri ca and take the chi l dren to hi m.
  That wa s my ma ndat e .  So, t his 
i s what I l i ve d with.  In fact , 
I asked mom after the 
wa r, I said, you know, ma mma, how could 
you put such a load on me?  I said, 
you know what it was like?  
She  sa ys, Fl ora , did I have a  c hoic e?   She  ha d no choice . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
41 
 
Q: Di d you worry about  
your mothe r, or  miss  he
r wh en you were away? 
A: Yes.  Very much.  I was very a
ttached to her.  As a matter of 
fact, it was not until she died that I 
realized how much our psyche's we
re intert wined.  Because we liv
ed thr ough so much, in a way ,  
toget her , e ve n though we  we re s epa ra ted at  ti mes .  
That it was, let me
 put it this way,
 if that ma ke s 
any se nse , I  felt r esponsible  for  
my mother 's ha ppi ness .  M y mo
ther ended up being the onl y  
survivor of her entire generation.  Of
 the, I'm talking fa mily.  She, it 
was very di fficult for her.  She  
had a, an ___________
, whi ch nobody els e kne w exce pt me .  Wh
at she  we nt thr ough.  And, to her ,  
to the day she died, I fe lt a tre m
endous responsibility of
 making her happy. 
 And in those days,  
ma king her happy, wa s to
 be good, t o  do what 
she  aske d, to ma ke sure  t he c hildre n were  oka y. 
Q: So, when it was time to le
ave  the orpha na ge, _____________. 
A: I came back to the se
cret apart ment that we had and, by t hen
, my uncle a nd my 
a unt wer e  in t he  
apart ment .  
Q: Actually, I just want to tr
y to ge t a  s ense  of t he day... 
A: Ok ay , b y the ti me we l e
ft t her e, was, it was either
 late July or early August,
 '43, by then.  Okay?  
We went back to t he apart ment . 
 And, a s I sai d, by t hen
 my mother 's younger sister , her hus band 
and the little one were 
already staying in ou
r clandestine apartmen
t.  By then, my 
mother had started 
sleeping in the factory.  Msr. Ra
usonk's(ph) fa ctory.  Actually, he 
was with the Resistance, also. 
During the day they had 
to work for the Germans.
  They make like little 
micro parts for, I don't 
kno w i f it wa s for ar ms or wh at
, but t here was so methi n g that 
the y produc ed, s o me ki nd of 
industrial  object  that  the Ger man
s nee ded.  But, at night, in 
t he cell ar, t hey worked for  th e  
Res i sta nce .  The y made, you know, s ecret ar ms a nd 
all ki nds of things .  He was , be sides hidi ng us,  
he had a couple of fa milie
s that were hidden in 
attics of buildings that 
he owned.  One of the  
fa milies was hidden upstairs in 
the  buildi ng t hat house d, it  was 
like acr oss the str eet  fr om t h e

fa ctor y, that  house d a c a f eteria wh
ere his worker s had t heir  lunch. 
 And the  people , duri ng t he day, 
coul d not make a s ound beca use t he worker s downsta
ir s, you know, ca me  and 
ate at di ffer ent hours 
and there were snacks during th
eir breaks or whatever .  But  then
 at ni ght, once t he fact ory was 
close d, t hey had t he run of the house , the whole 
buil ding.  So, he had a fe
w fa milies that he hi d 
besides us.  Wh ich is something I di
dn't know until after the war.  So
, we stayed with my uncle there 
in the apar t ment and then, Fat h
er  Bruno ma de the arr a nge me nt
s for us to be hidden in  
Wersel ater( p h).  Wer selat er(ph) was near Tielt( ph)
, whic h was  not far fr om Bruesc h(ph) ,  whic h was  
like on the other side of the country.  Totally oppos
ite side of where we ha

Etebekke( ph) was ri ght outsi de , was  really pa rt 
of Br uss els , Etebekke( ph), Doel was nort h, but i t  
wa s near  the  sea, thi s was close r  goi ng to

Q: Now, di d you me et Fat h

A: At that p oint , no .  At  that
 poi nt, t he only ti me  I had see n 
hi m was at, at __
____________, of 
cour se, I didn't know t hat  it was Fat he r  Bruno until  
later on.  I really became close to Father Bruno  
aft er t he li beration.  That 's when
 I really felt a relationship with
 Fat her  Br uno.  So, we wer e  
supposed to, the way we  
went to t he  last hi ding place , a nd t h
at wa s al so, a nd my mother , agai n,  
begged my aunt to let the little one go, and she just couldn't bri
ng herself to do it 
and by this time, 
the little one was al
ready two years old.
  So, go ahead. 
Q: I 'm s orry to i nterr upt  you. 
A: No, that 's oka y. 

Q: At  t his point, di d you kno
w much about what  was goi ng on
 with the war and the ca mps?  
A: At this point I kne w, because at t hi s poi nt al
r ea dy, pe opl e jumped tr ains 
and people who es ca ped, 
some how mana ged to come  ba ck and 
tell and, it was like, 
there was like, an u
nofficial , there was a  
grapevi ne.  There was a grapevi ne.  People picked

information, too. Because there were
 Jews involved, too.  
The r e wer e  a lot o f Je ws wh o  were wit h 
the Resi stance in Bel gi u m.  Th
ere was, i n fact, 
there wa s a gr oup c alled t he Commite( ph)  
De fanc e(ph)  De(ph) Sc hwi f( ph) , t he  Commi ttee  fo
r t he De fense of t he Je ws, which was a  Je wi sh 
group.  As a matter of fact, I met 
one, the head of t hat group, Mrs. 
Stra ssber g(ph), j ust t h is spr i ng in  
Brussels.  And they worked with the Resist ance 
and with t he gr oup wi th
 Father Br uno and a n  
attorney Va nde nberg( ph).  As 
a ma tter of fa ct, Va nde nberg( ph) 
wa s a Chr i stia n who di ed i n a  
concentr ation camp.  He 
wa s ar reste d, not  for  hi ding Je ws, 
but for hi ding pe ople  who hid be cause  
they didn't wa nt to go for forc ed la bor , bec ause , 
you know, Christians also
 were taken for forced 
labor .  It wa sn't  just Je
ws.  So, he di d di e in a c o nce ntrati on 
camp.  Yo u know, ther
e were like a lot 
of, a s I sai d , I jus t  trans l ated a book, I 'm j ust
 a b out putti ng t he polis hing touc hes on it, on this  
net wor k and these peopl e who were helped.  It was 
an incre di ble operati o n.  So, but a t  that ti me, I  
wa sn't aware  of who wa s  totally 
invol ved, exc ept t hat the na me, Fat her Br uno c a me up.  And not 
only that, until 1993, I didn't even kno
w the name of the person
 who took us to the 
last hiding place. 
Because here's what happened.  
We wer e suppos ed to go to t he 
railroad station an
d meet a woman  
dres sed i n a certai n manner, no na me  give n, not hi ng. 
 We wer e just s upposed t o kind of make eye  
cont act with the woman a
nd so, act ually, mo m di d an
d he r.  Alt hough, a nd we had t o sta nd a par t  
fr om, our mom st ood 
in one  spot, we stood i n  anot her  spot
, the woma n st ood in a not her s pot . 
Alt hough, we sa w e ach other , a
nd our instructions were
 that , whe n the t r ain pulle d i n and thi s  
partic ular woman we nt into
 the train, that we were to follow he
r, sit down where 
she sa t down, but  
not to addre ss her .  But , you know, when I think a
bout it, a s I 'm sayi ng, it 's a mazi ng t hat we wer e  
able to carry all this out. 
 And we did.  We did.  
We  di d exac tly as we we re tol d.  At t hat ti me , a nd 
when I thi nk bac k, one  of the hardes
t t hings t hat I personall y ever di
d, a nd I talke d to my sisters , a nd  
for t he m, too, was not  t o sa y goo
dbye to my  mo ther.  No
t to hug her.  You 
know, you go off on a

train, still, we were still 
kids, by then, when
 we left the apartment it wa
s early September, '43, b y  
then, I  was  13, Charl otte  
wa s 10 and Bett y wa s se ven.  So, we , 
a nd als o, I said, r u mor s  ha d s tarte d 
coming back because one of t he pe
opl e that had jumped a trai n, as 
a matter of fact, 
was a friend o f  
mo m's , who wa s one of t he re fuge es
 i n 1938 who had s t ayed i n our 
apar t m ent.  Because there was a 
Mr. and Mr s. Gr oss( ph)  who ha d s t
ayed with us.  And Mr. Gr oss(
ph) had jumped a train.  And 
found mom, beca use he kne w her , 
bec ause , you know, thr ough the gr
a pevine, you kind of let each  
other  know where you a re.  And,
 he had gi ven infor mati on.  Th
e n, there wa s a not her pers on who  
had j u mpe d a train a nd had come , tha t  we kne w
.  And, t here wa s no, no
t onl y wa s the r e no room,  
spac e, but a l so being the  Ge stapo 
wa s, I gue ss, must have bee n se
ar chi ng for hi m, mom hid hi m.  
See, she had these false papers, 
so s he was  abl e  to move ar ound.
  She hid hi m i n
 a bombed out 
buil ding.  Gave hi m bla nket s, what e ver we  had an
d everyt hi ng.  And s h e to
ok food to 
him.   An d 
then one day, he wa sn't 
t here.  Because he, he 
wa s pr etty ba dl y wounde d, 
he c oul d bar ely, he  had 
great  di ffi cul ty wal king at  that  
point , because fr om the j u mpi ng, th
at , I don't  know what  happened t o  
hi m t o t his  day. 
Q: We 're al most out of t ape , s o...

A: No matter what the ci rcumst ance
s are, t here's a natur al way of pa
rting fr om a pare nt.  You give  
the m a hug, you kis s t he m
, you say goodbye, you lo
ok back at them.  We 
weren't all o we d to do any 
of those things.  We  just litera
lly had to ig
nore her and preten
d that she was a stranger.  And I 
re me mber it being very, very di ffic u
lt.  It went totally against my 
being beca use we were  a touchi ng 
fa mi ly.  We  always hugged, we 
t ouche d a nd he re we c oul dn't eve n, not  onl y not t o uch her , we  
coul dn't e ve n look at he r and say 
goodbye .  Or e ven fr om t h e train,
 wave goodbye .  Or a nyt hing.  
And we  di dn't .  We  di dn't .  We  we
nt into the train, we followed th
e la dy who, as  I s a id, i n 1993 I  
learne d her na me , it was  Mrs. Vande r vagen( ph) .  
And s he was a Chr i stia n wo man, poor woma n,  
who did this.  And the only thi
ng she asked for in return was re
imbursement for a 
little lunch tha t  
she bought.  Unfort unat e ly, I di dn't
 fi nd her ali ve, so I could t hank 
her per sonally.  She, whe n the  
train st oppe d, which I know now t o
 be We rsel at er(ph), we f ollowe d 
her out of the train and, not 
until we were quite a bit of
 a  di stance  from the  trai n st ation, di d 
she st op, t ur n ar ound, sor t  of spr ea d  
her ar ms out  around us , say, I 'm taki ng you to a sa
fe place.  And she took
 us to the convent of 
Wersel ater( p h).  Wersel at er(ph) wa
s a  boar ding school , it  als o had an
 orc har d, it had a  fa r m.  Duri ng 
the war, however, in add
ition to the regular boardi
ng school, they added on
e of the wings of the, 
they t ook one of the wi ngs of t he convent rat her
, and turned it into a Fr
esh Air camp for poor  
childr en, chil dren whose father s we
re prisoner s of war , or what ever
.  And e very thre e mont hs a ne w  
group of children came .  They le
ft , t hey ne ver  ca me  b
ack.  They ha d no visi
t ors duri ng the  thr e e  
mont hs that t hey wer e there.  In
 t he boarding sc hool, the chil dre n ha d vis itor s ever y wee k end.  The y 
went home for holidays, th
ey came back. 
 Even the physical fa cilities we
re very differ
ent.  In the 
boarding school, the children's dor mi
tory was divided up into little cu
bbyholes, each child had sort 
of an alcove, a bed, a nightstand, 
s ma ll closet for  t heir clot hing, a nd a curta i n s o t he y c o uld ha ve a

little privacy.  Their dining room ha
d small tables, tablecloth, fl ower
s, and it was a beautiful room 
with large windows and everything else.  Being 
the other set-up was a 
te mporar y set-up, t he  
dormitory was a large room and 
metal beds, one next to the ot
her.  Just di
vided by a little 
nightsta nd.  And in the di ning room 
were long tabl es, set up where chil
dren sat one next to the ot her. 
The r e was, t o me , that was a very i m porta nt di sti nc
tion.  In a dditi on to t h at, in the c ol ony, as it wa s 
called, t here was one t eacher for al
l  the grades, and she did, basical
ly what she did was babysit and 
not re ally te a ch muc h.  She dis cipli ne d.  She wa s 
not a nun, she was a secu
lar teac her who had been 
brought in.  And t he ol der c hildr en helped wit h 
dar ni ng s ocks.  I  lear
ned how to do bea uti ful 
darning work.  I can 
still darn nicely to this
 day.  And, we help
ed kind of watch the little ones and 
all that and being I was one of the 
older ones, by then I wa
s in charge, in addition 
to being in charge.  
I want ed to go to sc hool.  I wanted to go to the 
boarding sc hool and I re me mber as king the Mot her  
Superi or, why ca n't  I go t o the bo
ar di ng school?   And s he 
sai d , for  sec urit y  reas ons .  She sai d, here 
there are no visit ors, no one is a ski ng questi ons 
as to why I don't go to 
communion.  The children 
leave , they never c o me back.  In
 t he boar ding sc hool s he fel t  t h
at, at some  poi nt
, s o me body woul d 
ask questi ons.  So, she  s ays , unle
ss, if you had been ba ptize d , s he 
s ays, I  could l et you go to t he  
boar ding s c hool.  That  wa s the 
only, i f you c oul d call it me ntio
n, of my, perhaps, becomi ng  
bapti zed.  Ot her wise , out side of t h
at , never was  there a ny pre s sure or
 anyt hing.  The ot her girl t hat  
was there, there were
 t w o girl s, act ua lly, we were  fi ve , to th
e best of my  knowle
dge.  One of the m 
did not st ay too long.  
She did an awful lot of 
crying.  Sh e, one day, 
just vani she d.  And my  
assumpti on was, t hat , because she co
uldn't control her e moti o ns, the y c
oul dn't a fford t o ke ep her .  
Bec ause the one t hing, and not only
 fr om my own experiences, but fr
om speaking to other children 
who have be en hi dden, you 
had to be, quote, a good 
child.  And when I say 
good, as I  sa id, you ha d  
to be abl e to obey, you had to be a ble  to be qui et
 when you were told t o be quiet .  You had t o not

cry.  In ot he r wor ds , you had to al mo st be invisible.  To be kept.  So, a nd the othe r gi rl that was  
there , e ventually, was ba ptize d a nd went t o, t he 
one was sent away, the ot
her one  was bapti zed and  
we nt t o t he  boar ding school .  As a 
matt er of fa ct, I  di d me et her a g
ai n here  in the  Uni t ed State s. 
She 's Je wi sh today.  She  
felt t hat  there was pr essure put  on he
r to be baptized.  My e xperi enc e,  
havi ng been in the sa me place , was 
that there was no pre ss ure put on
 us .  Ne ver di d anyone, a ny of 
the nuns, sa y to me , you ha ve t o be
 bapti zed, I hear d the m say, or 
you'l l  go t o hell, or what eve r .  
Ne ver .  We  did l earn c a techi s m, 
we ha d to everythi ng the  othe r ch
i l dr en di d, shor t of going t o  
communion.  We  we nt t o  
churc h, pra y ed and st udi e d c atec his m.  
That, s he  di d te ach us, that tea che r. 
Q: Di d the  ot her chil dre n know you were... 

A: No. Nobody kne w we wer e Je wi sh. 
 The, as a matter of fact , when, 
at t he end, t hey we re pa cki ng 
to go home, they said, so I gu
ess , we 're  all goi ng home  toda y.  
I sai d, yes, we 'r e all  goi ng ho me  
toda y.  Exc ept, that t he y we nt 
ho me and we st ayed.  
Eventually, we were th
ere  for  13 mont hs. 
When Belgium was liberated, we  stayed awhile, bac
k, l ater.  In Apri l of 
1944, my, one da y, mom,  
I 'm goi ng t o go bac k t o Bruss e ls on
 this.  But, of course
, this  I don't know from pers onal  experie nce . 
I onl y know this t hrough mo m.  M o m, as  I s aid
, was sl eepi ng t he ________
___ fac t or y, and taki ng  
food to my a unt and uncl e that he ha d brought int o
 the factor y.  She came on
e evening wit h the food 
and there was a Gest apo seal  on 
the door.  Now, what 
is a Gestapo seal?  Whenever  t he Gestapo 
would e mpt y a resi dence  of t he inha bitants a nd t a ke
 them away to concentr
ation c a mps, they would 
seal the door with a seal, a Ge
stapo seal, which was easily remo
vable, we're not talking about 
anyt hing t ha t , it was a s ort of a car dboar d, pa per  
kind of t hi n g.  Like a st icker .  Whic h mea nt no 
trespassing.  A few days later th
ey would come  back with a truc
k a nd e mpty t he content s of the 
residence.  From us, th
ey didn't get that mu ch
.  Be cause, don't forget, 
this wa s already late, you 
know, when we ra n a nd ever ythi ng

great val ue.  But  in ma ny residenc es, t hey did get 
great val ue.  The y 'd c o me
 bac k and t h ey'd e mpty 
the pla ce.  And it was cal led mublak
s eum(ph) .  And what t hey did is
 the y t ook t he poss essions bac k  
to Germany or whatever, 
you know.  And, as
 I said, I know pe
ople are still claimi
ng artwork that 
they t ook.  She came, th
ere was a Gestapo seal , sh
e kne w i mmediatel y wha t  had happened.  But , s he  
wa s, she had enough s o fw
au(ph), as they say, I 
don't know, how do you s a y, I mean, she was cool 
enough, cal m enough, because she wa
s, she had an incr edi bl e strength
.  Opened the seal, went i n to 
the a part me n t, took t he al bums out , 
s h e had this obsessi on, 
the albums .  And it was 
after that that the 
albums went to a 
Christian fa mily.  And she took
 a cover for herself, so sh
e could be a little warmer.   
And that's it.  And to
ok off.  I mea n, i f  they had ca ught her , 
I don't even t hi nk they woul d ha ve ta ken  
her to a concentration ca
mp, they would have probabl y kill ed 
her i m me dia t ely.  I get a  letter, now 
here 's t he  th ing , wh en  we  were  
hi dde n, and t his hel d tr ue for  
ot her  childr e n, al s o.  We  wer e  
receiving mail.  Not by official post , but by cour ie
rs.  And I would, I got  mail , it wasn't  a weekl y  
thing or a nything li ke t h at.  But, I did get mai l
 fr o m mo m and  I wa s a b le
 to respond.  Mother 
Superi or ca ll s me i nto he r offic e, I  di dn't know t h
at my aunt a nd unc le wer e
 taken, a nd the baby, of  
cour se.  M ot her Superi or  calls me  int o her  offi ce 
one da y, and sa ys t o me, Flor a, r ea d thi s letter  
fr om mamma.  And I read the lette
r and she says, what 's  
your mother saying? 
 I said, I think my  
mother i s saying that my  aunt 
a nd uncle and Nunu(ph), 
we used to call my co
usi n that , were ta ken  
by t he Ge sta po.  She says , 
exactl y what I thi nk.  Cause see, my 
aunt , my mother  wrote i n code .  She  
said, dearest Flora, your 
aunt and uncle and y
our little cousin went away 
on vacation to visit the rest  
of the fa mi l y.  I don't know whe n 
t he y 'll be bac k and I 
don't, something to th
e effect, I don't know 
what to do in the meanti
me .  So, s he , the  Mother
 Superi or pi cke d up on that a nd I i m me diat ely 
kne w what it  mea nt, beca use nobody we nt on vac a
tion, you know, i f you we
re Jewish.  You know, 
but t he n, see , by t hat poi nt in 
the war , I al ready knew, ther e were
 enough rumors comi ng back, that  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

we  ki nd of kne w what was happe ning.  We  didn'
t know about ga s c ha mb ers, we j ust  kne w pe ople  
were being deported and 
somewhere they were
 being killed, they vanished
, that's  what we knew.  
She t o ld me  to sen d  my  mo m a 
lett er.  Dear ma mma , why don't 
you come visit us whi l e Aunt 
Leah(ph) and Uncle Alex(ph) ar e on
 vacati on?  And my mo
ther came.  She, by t h
en, even with fals e 
papers, it wa s getti ng da ngerous .  
So, what she did is, she walked th
e rail road tra ck at night , sle pt  
under bus he s during t he day, a nd wh
en she ran out of food that she 
had, she took fr
om the fields. 
It 's a ver y fe rtile countr y, there are al wa ys thi ngs growi ng.  And, she came, by thi s, by that ti me  
already, of course, it wa s May of '4
4.  And she stayed in the conve nt
.  We  c oul dn't, Mot her Superi or  
gave her a room, a small 
room, under the staircase,
 I'll ne ver forget it. 
 She helped out in the 
orchard, by her own fr ee will becau
se she didn't want to eat for no
thing.  And, on
ce a week, we 
were allowed to see her.  Outsid
e of that once a week when t he 
Mother Superi or 
woul d come and 
take us for a  hal f hour vi sit, we
 were not all o we d to see her .  If
 we did s e e  her so me wheres in t he  
court yar d or in one of the  hallways, we had to pret
end we di dn't know he r.  
It was not that easy, the 
other  gi rl knew it wa s my mother , but, t he da y of he
r birt hda y, her  birt hday wa
s, this was at the end  
of June, her  birthday was in June , J une 29th t o 
be pre cise .  We wer e all owed to s ee  her on her 
birthday.  And t he M other Super i or
, the firs t che rries had j us t  bee n comi ng out , the y  wer e ver y  
early, but these were very early 
c he rries, unle ss  she got the m some whe re else that I don't know 
about.  Ther e was a box of cher ri
es, a met al box of cher ries that 
she gave mo m for her birthday. 
And then there was an envelope
 wit h some money.  And I re me
mbe r  mo m prot es
ting about the  
mone y.  And she sai d, t his 
might ha ve been past  her bir t hday, th
is was on one of th
e visits to her 
room, wit h t he Mot her Superi or .  It coul d have e v
en been lat er, because 
I distinctly remember it 
being cherri es.  Beca use  mo m l ove

 mom said, you're hidi ng me , you're hi ding 
my childre n, you'r e fee di ng me , 
why are you givi ng me  
mone y?   She sa ys , h

be over soon, you'll nee d it.  And she insiste d.  
I  think it was  somethi ng l i ke two hundred fi ft y or 
three hundred franks in there, whic
h wa sn't muc h , but , it was just, ev
en symbolically, it was just a  
bea uti ful ges t ure.  And, mo m ha d to endure quite  a 
bit.  There were a couple of people, adults, who  
wer e also residing in t he convent.  And ther
e was one couple w
ho was livi ng t he re, a n elderl y 
couple, and, this woman, 
the woman kept s ayi ng to 
mo m,  ge e, i t 's so 
good, i t 's great  to get rid of all  
these Je ws , and mo m ha d to endure 
t his.  And couldn't s ay a n ythi ng. 
 And one of t he first, a nd all  
kinds of r e marks  and e ve r ythi ng, a n
d one of the first things my mo
m did a ft er the li berat i on, was  go 
over to her , she says, what do y
ou t h ink of me?   She  sa ys , oh, bu
t, you're such 
a wonderful lady, 
Mrs. Fi ers , I  always  e njoyed ta lki ng to you a nd ev
er ythi ng, you know, you'r e
 great.  Mom says, you 
know somet hing?
  I'm a Jew.  Well , the woman's face dr
opped, needless to sa
y, because all t hese 
things that she said about the Je
ws a nd how wonder ful it 
is  t o finally get  rid of the m, bla h, bla h, 
blah, blah.  Anyway, after liberatio
n, the Mother Superior suggeste
d that the two little ones stay i n  
the convent and t hat j ust  mom and 
I we nt back, go ba ck t o Br ussel s
 t o see what we can do to get  
settled again.  So, she and 
I went back.  It was, 
you know, even that time
 was chaotic 
because we 
wer e liber at ed.  And, I 'l l  never forget the da y of
 liberation.  And the first tank rolled past, an d 
ever ybody r an out of the  cellars 
and ever ythi ng, t hey we re st a ndi
ng a nd t h ey were waving a nd all 
that.  I remember soldiers sitting on the tank.  By
 the way, we were liberat
ed, interestingly enough, 
by a Poli sh unit .  And e verybody sa
i d, no, t her e wer e no Poli sh units 
in Belgium.  I was there this 
past  spr i ng, f or t he umpt e enth ti me , I  wa nte d to ve ri

we c oul dn't have bee n liberate d by a Polis h unit ,  
yet I re me mber that .  The nun sai d, ye s, you a r e  
right .  We were liber ated by Polis h units.  The se wer e
 Poles in exile who were
 supposed to go into 
Hol l and, but  there was a  proble m fo

t his was di sputes bet wee n t he

Belgium to liberate.  See, politics
 play, always play in
to it.  So, it was a Po

tank goe s by, we 'r e wavi ng to t he s ol dier, when he ge
ts up t o the churc h, whic

street , whic h had a white fla g hanging out, from t h

Ger mans were  holdi ng up

t here was an expl osi on, t h

the other tank slowe d down, ca me ba ck, the sa me so
ldier that we were just 
wavi ng to, wa s laying on 
the tank, al l bloody.  I 'll never, never forge t  that 
si ght .  It woul d put s uc h a da mper, people sa y, oh,  
liberation, it was great, you know.  
It was, and, and then
 fighting still 
broke out, even
 when we got 
back to Brussels.  That when first, the V2's star
te d comi ng.  They were  th
e unmanned r ockets t hat  
Ger ma n y was sending out.  That wa s when the Ba
ttle of the Bulge was started taking place.   I 
mean, it just as everyb ody thought things, this is 
it, fi nished.  It wasn't .  
So, the little ones were in 
the convent and mo m... 
Q: This was in Se
ptember, October? 

A: This was begi nni ng October.  
Mi ddle Oc tober.  And I went  bac
k, we found a place  to live  a nd I  
went back to get th
e little ones.  And... 
Q: Any, I ' m just  wonde r i ng
, is  there anyt hing els e
 you can tell me about th
is last convent?  You  
were there for quite awhile.  In 
ter ms  of your  dail y li fe or t he 
wa y you ha d to live or  the way you 
had to ki nd of adj ust  your sel f?  

A: Okay.  Al right , well, discipli ne 
wa s strict.  That ti me was sta rting 
t o be l e ngt hy.  Ther e starte d to 
be this fe eli ng, whe n wi
ll this be over?  It was starting to 
be lengthy.  But, it was, almost had 
adjusted to this way of life. 
 I ha d a s mall per sonal pr obl e m, 
be cause the ot her gi rl who wa s  
bapti zed, wa s trans ferr ed to the boar ding sc hool. 
 And, I'll never forget, 
I met her once i n t h e 
garden.  So, of c our se, we
 di dn't reall y int eract  that much an
y more , I me t  her once i n the garden. 
And s he kne eled down a nd c ros sed he

do t hat now, there 's nobody he re
 t o see you.  You know, we ha d 
neve r  said, I ' m Je wis h, you're  
Je wish.  We  just kne w.  It was a ma zi ng.  Not wi
t h ever ybody, we just 
knew.  And she says , she  
threat ened she was goi ng to
 tell the Mother Superior
.  But the Mother  Superior
 kne w t hat I  ha d, tha t 
I could not accept, I did ask questio
ns.  And I was tempte
d.  There was somethi ng very beauti ful 
about the church, t he chapel, the 
ma ss.  And, I starte
d fe eling very s ecure .  So, there was a  
te mptati on of be comi ng Chr i stia n, 
but it was, but there was always
 my mother 's words behi nd me , 
you know, don't for get , ma ke s ure t h e chil dre n re mai n
 Jewish.  Don't forget.  
So, tha t  held t r ue for  
me, too.  But, we di
d have one problem.   
I  mea n, i t wasn't one proble m, 
there were severa
l.  Once in 
awhile, there wer e checks.  The d
oor would ring, me n i n uni for m, 
they ca me looki ng
.  They ca me  
looking for political diss
idents, they came looking for Ger m
an soldiers who had gone AWOL, 
whi ch, at  that point  of t he war , t her e was a l ot of
 it.  A lot of German so
ldiers were leaving their 
units .  And, t hey wer e als o looking for Jews.  A
nd, I re me mber  one s peci fi c  incide nt , it wa s several  
ti me s wher e we sort of had to ru
n and hide .  But, one speci fic on
e I re me mb er, be cau se I  re me mber  
being very, very frighte n ed
.  The doorbell rang, there 
were sort  of, there was a 
sort of plan, that was 
set int o moti on i m me diat ely, as s o
on as some one in uni for m would 
come  to the fr ont door.  Ther e  
was a chai n of co mmand, so speak
.  Anywa y, we  kne w exa c tl y wher e 
to go, a nun c a me wit h us. 
And we  ra n into, re me mber 
I told you it was a 
fa r m, a nd the y  ha d potat oe s.  Of c ours e , they ha d t o 
share it wit h the Ger mans.  They we
r e  raised, you know, quot a s that 
t hey had to ta ke .  We r an down 
to the cellar and t he nun and t he t h
ree of us ran behind a big pile 
of pot at oes .  I mea n , I talk, you 
know, a big pile.  So, we ran be hind
 it, we  sat down and we
 stayed put, quietly. 
 All  o f  a 
sudden, the  
door to the cellar, I didn't see it,
 I hea rd it, open up, I hear foot
steps comi ng down, se veral pe ople , 
and I re me mber hear ing in Ge r ma n, ___

getting so c old.  And I  held my lit tle, the littl

Charlotte.  And, we were sitti

 we, every once in awhile the 
comma nd woul d, we knew they wer e 
there because we hadn
't heard t he door cl ose .  And it woul d 
be quiet for a minute, and then, we
 heard pot atoe s rolli ng. 
 So, I felt like , s o mebody wa s dist ur bi n g  
the potato pile behind which we
 were sitting.  We hear
d potatoes rolling and I 
hear someone say,

__, or somet hing to that e f fe
ct.  And the n  they le ft.  And we just st aye d put for  
awhile yet .  We didn't da re come out.  And t hen, 
a f ter a certain a mount of ti me , we fi nall y did come  
out .  We  wer e sa fe. 

Q: Di d you have  any cont act wit h 
t he l ocal  populati on in that  ar ea? 
A: There was, not  exactl y cont act. 
 My sister , Charlot t e, some how 
be fri ended one of the  ki ds  that  
was coming to the convent, there wa
s also, see the convent , it was a 
large conve nt.  Li ke a hundre d  
and t we nty nuns or s o mething at th
e ti me .  Now, they've, t h ey've dw
i ndl ed down to a very fe w. 
There were, the nuns also
 ran the public school.  
And, I say the public sc
hool, I me an 
the village 
school .  So, you ha d t h e childre n 
t hat came for the th
r ee mont hs, you ha d t he boarding school ,  
whi ch were  like t he  weal thy ki ds, 
and then you had the regular scho
ol.  The kids t hat ca me ever y 
day and then went home every ni
ght.  Charlotte, so
mehow, had met one of
 the little girls and 
beca me fr ie ndl y wit h one of t he m
.  And I re me mber bei ng very ne
rvous about that .  And once or  
twice, she would go to th
at c hild's hous e.  And wh
en t he nuns lea r ne d a bout 
it, t he y stoppe d it.  I t  
was the cust er(ph), t he custer i s, 
you know, like the man t hat ta kes c a
re of t he churc h, not, who ki nd  
of kee ps it cl ean and or de rly and all t h at, I don't know 
the word in English.  Bu
t, outside of that, we 
didn't really have any contact
 with the outside.  I di
d, occasionally, sneak out 
of the building.  And, I 
snuck out be caus e I just nee ded, eve n though the r
e was a courtyar d, and I  wa
s able to get fresh air 
within, once in awhile, I ju
st felt like I needed to get out.  
And, I reme mb er, I snuck out, and I'd go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
54 
 
into the fields.  And th
e wheat wa s growing hi gh, and I woul d 
just go i n and kind
 of sit down by 
myself and just, just sit.  Litera
lly, just sit and look up at the s
ky fo r little periods of
 time, and then  
sneak back into the convent.  An
d it was forbi dden, I wasn't allo
we d, for  obvi ous  
reasons.  Th e 
other thing I did one day,
 they had a little room 
in the courtyard, 
where every, where a nun died, or  
someone, she would be laid out in 
that little, like a little, tiny thing, 
two by four, or wh
atever.  They, 
until burial time.  And, 
I remember, being very cu
rious as to what happen
ed to her in that little  
room, and I one day I snuck in t here and I ki nd of 
felt her toe s, and she di dn't move [l aughter ] .  I  
mean, little things like that
, you know.  And, that's
 where, also, I, well, 
never mind, this isn't 
i mport ant .  ______

Q: So, you and your mother
 returned to
 Br ussels... 
A: Ri gh t.  
Q: You ca me back to re
tr ieve  your  sis t ers.  What  wa s, 
and t his  is October , '44, ri ght?  
A: '44, late October, '44. 
Q: Wh at wa s go in g 
on in Brussel s?   
Wh at was it like? 
A: Okay.  Things were still chao
tic in Brussels, at th
at time.  You 
had British troops, you had  
American troops.  People, at that
 point, there were no refu gees co
ming back, yet, bu
t you still had to 
kee p running down i nto shelters bec ause , as I sa i
d, the V2's wer e fl ying over .  See , the wa r didn't  
end til '45.  So, there was a lot of
, there was bombings, th
ere was shootings, ther
e were all kinds of 
things still happeni ng.  Food wa s 
har d to come by, but the Je wish
 or gani z ation was alr eady setti ng 
into place , a nd was t he j oint , as you say, Je wis h 
i m mi gra nt, Hebre w i m mi grant soci ety.  And t hey  

starte d to hel p Je ws who wer e ret urni ng eit her fro
m hidi ng pla ces a nd t he n later on, of c ours e, t hos e  
wh o were c o min g ba ck fr o m th e 
camps.  And, we al so, one da
y mo m wa s on a tr
olley car and a 
British soldier walked over to her,
 I guess t here must ha ve be e n some
t hing about her , and he sai d to

her, Yi ddi sh?   And she s a ys , yea h. 
 And, so he wa s like s o exci ted tha t  he s a w a live Je w.  Ca me a nd 
brought her some food a nd all.  
Eve ntuall y, a nd then, of cour se, 
Fathe r  Bruno, mom, now, I don't 
know how Fat her Bruno kne w wher
e we were living.  I think, pr
obably, through the Mother 
Superi or, some how the  cont act wa
s ma de , ma mma , Fat her  Bruno ca
me  to t he  hous e.  You know,  
there ar e questions that , even t hough mo m and I talk
ed a lot , there ar e some questions t hat someho w 
never ca me up.  Beca use  I, mysel f, di dn't talk abou
t this until about 1980.  I did go back to visit and  
ever ythi ng, but I  di dn't t alk.  I did not c ons ider  
mysel f  a sur vivor.  Beca
use I had not bee n i n a  
camp.  So, I defe
rred to, to me, surv
ivors were those who survived th
e camps.  And,
 not until 1980, 
when i n, it wa s either '8 0 or '81, 
I was teac hing a t  Einst ein Hi gh Sc
hool i n  Kensington, and a Soc i al  
Studies teac her a nd I we re in t he offi ce, a nd he 
pulled out  a pa mphl et, some
t hing fr om his mail box, 
and , as we wer e  wa lki n g do wn th
e hall way, my eye fell on
 t hat pa mphl et , and I s ay, let me ta ke a  
look at that.  It was one of th
e first pamphlet s that 
I had s een by, we call 
t h e m t he _____________, 
revisi oni sts , Al fre d But z( ph) , out of Northwe ste
r n, when he had writt en 
a book, the hundre d a nd 
twe nty quest i ons about t he Hol oca us t that have 
never bee n a ns were d, t he  Hoax of the Twe ntiet h  
Ce ntur y.  Well, t her e wa s thi s a nge
r t hat came up.  And, 
I say, sure , it  ne ver  ha
ppe ne d.  So, where  i s  
ever ybody?   And t hat sa me  da y, I put a note i n 
every teacher's mailbox in
 my sc hool , identi fyi ng 
mysel f  as a survi vor for the fir st 
ti me .  And sayi ng I 'd be glad to 
come talk to thei r st udents.  And 
then later on, one of the teachers to whose class 
I had spoken to, a
nd who had done, then, a little unit 
on t he Hol o caust , had a swastika pa
i nted on her door.  So, s he a nd 
I and a Social St udies teacher 
fr om Ric har d Mont gomery, got t
ogether and decided, because they
 we r e  bot h Socia l  St udie s.  I 
taught forei g n la nguage, I taught 
Fr ench and some Ger man at the 
ti me .  So, t heir fr ustrati on wa s 
that, at that t i me, there was not hi ng on the Hol ocaus
t that you coul d us e to teach i n the  textbooks .  
The r e were  ma ybe t wo l i nes .  So, th
ey were frustrated an
d I wa s.  So, t h e thre e of us  got t ogether  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
56 
 
and we cre a t e d a course .  We 've be
e n  teac hing for  11 year
s, the teachers.  We  do teacher training.  
So, that came out of this 
anger.  So, t hat 's when, fo
r t he first  ti me, I identi fi
ed mysel f a s a s urvi vor . 
Q: Let 's  just go ba ck to ri ght
 after the war in Belgium. 
A: Okay.  Father Bruno ca
me to visit.  I had to 
go to work.  Mom and me 
ha d t o try to fi nd so me  
work.  I  ha d to go t o 
work, I found so
me  work, we a gai n did s o me 
s ewi ng in the  house , wit h  
mamma.  Also, I found a 
job filling boxes with soap powder.  A
nd, being the youngest, had to scrub 
the stairs in the building, and I 
worke d, I ca me home .  
Then mom felt that, if 
I c oul d work wit h my  
hands , I could earn my brea d anywheres i n the  wo
rl d.  So, she, t here wa
s a dressmaker i n the 
buil ding we lived i n.  So, she asked her to take me 
on as an a ppre ntic e.  She did.  And then I we nt  
and t ook some e ve ning cour ses , lear ning how t o ma ke patter n s, clot hi ng patterns.  To desi gn the m ,  
cut and all that.  _____
___________, wa st
e pa per to make t he m thi s bi g, you ca n't do a nyt hing wit h  
the m.  But, anywa y, it wa s around 
that ti me t h at Fat her Br uno ca me
 t o  visit.  And he was al so 
honore d, I we nt to a Hannuka(ph) 
party wher e  he was honored.  J ust before he le ft , be cause he 
eventuall y went to Rome and t o Pa

to bri ng the m bac k t o t h e fait h.  Bu
t ,  anyway, he came t o visit , he 
br ought  food.  I we

re me mber I t old you, t hey

 time, when he visited, said to me , 
so, what are you doing, Little
 Flora?  And I told hi

ning with the dressmaker 
and all.  He said, 
wouldn't  you rather 
go t o s chool?    
I said, yeah, but I ha ve t o hel p ma

them arguing in the other roo m, th

And, I hear mamma sa

school on the _____________
____, in Br uss els .  I went back there 
this spring, as a matter of fact. 
But, I didn't know at
 the time, but I just learne
d now, is that his siste r, 
the sc hool bel ongs t o t he  
same order where his sister 
is a nun.  And she's still 
alive.  I saw her this sp
ring.  I visited her.  I 
visited Father Bruno's brother, he ha
s two siblings that are still alive.  And, he 
sent me to school.  I 
learne d how to type .  Then I fi na
lly took, a fter I fi nished t h e patte
r n course , I went  at night a nd 
learne d how to do bookkeepi ng.  I 
was al wa ys tr ying to juggl e and le
arn a nd t hings lik
e that .  But,  
anywa y, not onl y did I le arn how to t ype , that wa s ex
tra curri c ular, he ha d one of the nuns give me  
piano lessons.  I  di dn't ha
ve a piano, because he knew
 I loved music, but I di dn
't have a piano, so t he 
convent, the school was 
on one side of the street
, it's still there, but 
it's a different, they do  
somet hing di fferent , it 's not exact
l y the sa me type of sc hool.  Th
en, it wa s a regular, you know, you 
know, sc hool.  The convent on on
e s i de, school on the ot her  side
.  And, in the morning before 
class es, the y  woul d lea v e the conve nt door ope n 
and t he parl or door ope
n, and I would go in and 
practi ce on t heir piano.  Then I w
oul d go ac ros s t he str eet and go t o c l ass e s.  And t he n , of course , 
aft er s chool , i m me diate l y a fte r sc hool , ther
e wa s typing and dra wi ng le ss ons , which wer e  
extrac urri cul ar.  And I l ove d it, 
just absolutely loved it.  Ther
e wa s a slight pr oble m, though. 
Because, yo u see, we came fr om the Flemish part 
of the c ountry, I ha d been at Eter vi g(ph), but I  
didn't exactl y learn how to read a
nd write i n Fr e nch.  I learned ho
w t o speak French.  And I didn't  
speak French until, l
earn French until we came, af
ter we were in Brussels
.  So, that was another  
thing we dealt with.  Then
 we went back, Wersel ate
r(ph) wa s in the Fl emish part of the country.  So , 
then, by the t i me I came back to 
Brussels, mo st of the Fr ench was 
gone agai n, except for  speaking a 
little bit.  So, I really had to learn how to read and 
write French.  So, 
at fi rst, I just sat in class and 
then, slowly, anyway, to make a l
ong st ory s hor t, he did vi s it a 
couple  of ti me s.  And the n, of  
cour se, he  le ft .  And t he n  I di dn't se e hi m a gain. 
 But  I corresponded wi th hi
m.  And, I did visit hi m  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
58 
 
a fe w ti mes be for e  he le ft Belgi u m.  I  visited hi m 
a few ti mes where he li ved. 
 He wa s sort of like a 
surr ogat e fat her.  Ther e wa s somet hi ng, how ca n I 
explai n, very, very s p ecial about t he man.  He  
had t hes e t winkli ng e y es and, 
you know some t hin
g, e ver ybody who knew or
 met Father Br uno, 
people  who had be en hi dd
en by hi m and everyt hi ng,
 tell me, when 
I say he ha d the se t winkl y e yes ,  
they say, that was exactl y it, t h
at was Fat her Bruno.  
I me an, it  just, t her e wa s some thi ng a bout hi s  
fa ce.  It wa s like goodne s s itsel f.  And I always 
asked hi m, you know, Fa the r Bruno, you took such, 
you see , Fat her Bruno was betr aye
d.  Father Bruno had t o get out 
of hi s  habit a nd wea r  civili a n  
clothes.  And yet, he  c o ntinued 
doing what he was doi ng.  He hi s 
over  300 chil dre n
.  And, he and 
Fat her Andr e(ph) , another priest , the y stole vir gi n 
identity cards, and they
 stole muni cipal sta mps  
and filled them in with 
t he chil dre n 's  fal se na me s .   And the n he had t o go a nd get ration sta mps wit h 
that.  And he ha d a c oll abor ator t her e.  I mea n, 
i t  wa s a mazi ng t he thi ngs he did.  So, I we nt t o  
school t here  and, e vent u ally, I dr opped out of 
t h e school bec ause ma mma 
felt that the schooling  
wouldn't re al ly do muc h for me .  That
 I reall y needed t o l earn a trade.
  So, I became , 
I really learned 
how to be a dressmaker.  And, then
 through a soldier, we, who help
ed us, he, a British soldier, he 
helped find my fathe r .  And on
e da y, it was Christ mas mor ning, I 
di dn't know it at  the ti me, of 
cour se, you know?   The  doorbell  ra ng
 and I , ma mma  sai d, r u n open th
e  door , a nd I went t o ope n t he  
door, and t h ere was an Ameri can so
ldier at t he door .  And he  said
, Me ndelowitz( ph)?   I say, ye s, 
oui .  And he  says , Me rry Chr i st ma s! 
 I didn't know wh at that
 meant .  I knew Noel at t hat point .  So, 
and he hands  me a box.  And he lea v es.  There was 
a letter taped to the top. 
 And, I ' m standing ther e  
and all of a sudde n I 'm s t arting to yel l  out, ma mma
, ma mma!  The r e was s oldier here a nd he gav e  
me  a box. And I run 
up with the  box, be ca use 
we l i ve d on the sec ond 
fl oor , a nd, nobody eve n  
looked at t he letter , we opened t h
e box.  A box.  It  wa s 
filled with fo od.  Spam
 and e ver ythi ng else . 
At that point, we ate e v erythi ng.  Toda y I don'
t  eat por k, but the n, a s l
ong as we had food, who

cared what we ate?  An
d, the n whe n we  were  full,  we e nd e d 
up bei ng s i ck for se ver al days , we 
over ate.  But  that wa s another st or y.  And, we re a d the letter a nd 
it was a letter from the American  
Headquarters in Brussels asking 
mo m to c o me b y on a cert a i n day ,
 that day.  Her husband was an 
Ameri can veteran and, eventu
ally, t he  Ar my brought us 
to the States
.  In 1946. 
Q: Whe n you were  livi n g 
in Brussels, after the war, were ther
e ot her Je wi sh people  who ha d c o me  
back? 
A: Ye ah.  Okay.  Pe opl e  
we re c o ming ba ck, st art ed c o ming b
ack fr om t he  ca mps a ft e r  '4 5.  And, I  
cannot des cr i be t o you, what s o me 
of them looked like.  
It, most of the m didn't , c oul dn't t alk about , 
you know, you'd as k, sa y, well, wha t  happene d?   Th
ey coul dn't eve n tel l
 you.  And, you waite d,  
ma mma  wai t ed for my a unt t o c o me bac k.  And 
my uncle , a n d the  ba by a
nd othe r me mbers of t he  
fa mi ly.  And, they never came b
ack.  And there were ma
ny wh o waited and they
 didn't come back. 
Basically, it became a waiting game
.  So, you know, simu
ltaneously, while all 
this was going on  
that I was te lling you a b out , at t h
at s a me ti me what you di d is, 
you wait ed.  And 
i f some pe ople  
came, came and they need
ed a place to st ay, you 
had, at  one poi nt, we ha d se ver al pe ople , a gai n, 
living with us.  We  ha d s everal  yo
ung girls who ha d manage d t o come
 ba ck.  And, i n fa ct, a c ouple  
of them did tell mamma so
me t hings .  And I as ked ma mma , bec a
use  I 'd over hear d a wor k he re a nd  
there, but not everything. 
 She 'd say, not for you, Sweet heart , you
're too young.  You're too young. 
And, it was hard.  An
d many, there wa
s one person I'm still looking fo
r.  He was a 
little boy who 
we 're i ndir ec tly relat ed t o  throug
h ma rriage , who wa s born
 i n '39.  And, a ft er liber ation his fa mil y, 
his par ent s, his 17 year old br other, all of the m
 wer e  take n a nd they di dn
't come bac k .  And, t he  
convent that he was in, 
because mo m knew wher e he 
wa s, allowe d us t o ta ke
 hi m home, like for t h e 
wee ke nd.  So, I would bring 
hi m home , I re me mber hi m bein
g fu ll of sores 
and ma mma got 
nauseous when s he ha d to take  care  
o f hi m, so she  ma de me  ta k e  care  
of t he sore s.  I 
took care of his  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

sore s.  Th en wh en we we re tryin g 
to l eave for the Uni t ed States, we 
were trying to take him with us 
beca use  hi s fa mi ly, there  wa s nobo
dy.  But, the convent wouldn't 
r e lea s e hi m t o us beca use  we  
wer e n't hi s, ma mma  was n 't  his pare nt.  So, ma mm
a got in t o uch wit h th
e Jewish community and 
then le ft hi m in their ha nds.  What ha ppe ne d wa s, 
in 1980, '83, there was a 
gathering in Wa shi ngt on  
and I me t a woma n and I told he
r the story.  So, she says, you 
know, there was a group of young 
childr en t ha t  wer e gi ve n to a n or pha na ge, t h e Je wis h or pha na ge, a f t er liber ation, and the n, 
Pittsburgh, a whole group of kids 
were adopted si
ght unseen.  Maybe he wa
s amongst th
em.  Sends 
me a phot ograph, I 'll rec
ognize hi m on t he photograp
h.  I haven't found hi m ye
t.  See, I don't think  
he r e me mber s hi s na me  or 
who he r eal ly wa s.   
Q: How long after you were liberat
e d, did you, did it t ake  you to ob
ser ve the Je wish 
religion again?  
Was t her e any ambivalence about t hat ? 

A: Okay.  Mom, as soon as, pick
ed right up again, trie
d to find candles, and 
we lit them, anything 
that she could find.  There was 
a piece of metal, so it shouldn't 
burn.  But , at t he same ti me , 
si multa ne ously, decl are d  th
ere is no God.  And God do
es not exi st, bec ause i f he had existe d, he 
wo uldn't do wh at he did.  Because sh
e wa s also trying to find out about
 the rest of th
e famil y and all  
then.  Of course, nobo
dy came back.  She di
ed a religious woman.  Her fait
h came  back to her, later, 
much later.  But, she always imme
di a t ely starte d obser ving t he ritual
s  a nd al wa ys did.
  So, she  lived 
a very Jewi sh li fe whi le clai ming
 and asking, where is Go d?  So, 
I think there was that ambivalenc e 
wit hin her .  But , as  I s aid, t owards 
later years, her belie
f in God returned. 
Q: Anythi ng else you ca
n tell me about Father Bruno or how, 
or your se nse of 
how much of an  
orga niza tion there  was?  

A: Okay.  I did not even 
know how much of an or
ganization there was until 19
91.  Of the extent.  I  
didn't know until 1991 that there wa
s anyone in the United
 States, outside of my
 two sisters, myself

and t hes e t w o pe opl e of whi c h t he 
one girl was in the convent ,  we
r e  sa ved by Fat her Br uno. It wa s  
in 1991, after a gathering of hidd
en childr en in New Yor k, t hat I  
learned of others in the Unite d 
State s who wer e  sa ve d by Fat her 
Br uno and I l e arne d th
at there was a book out
 t hat was assembl ed 
on Fat her Bruno a nd t h at Father  Bruno's  ne phew , Mi chell e(ph)  Raine r s(ph), who hel ped hi m  
through the war, lived in 
De nver, Colorado.  So , th
rough all this I was in 
the dark, but  I wrote  to 
Fat her Bruno.  In 1948 I  
received my  last New Year 's car d from 
Fat her Br uno.  As a matter of fact,  
it's in the book that I received it
.  I just translat ed an
onymousl y beca use they c oul dn't ma ke out  wh o 
had written this letter to Father
 Bruno and I ' m re ading it , when I 
st arted t ransl atin
g, but I said, My 
God, that's  my le
tt er!  And after t h at, I lost  
track of him.   In 1966, I 
went bac k to Bel gium and I  
searc hed for Fat her Br uno.  I had for g otten t he addre
ss in Bruss els that hi s fa mil y live d at , but I ha ve  
been ther e si nce.  But, I r e membered t he apart men
t  that he ha d take n, wher
e  I had visite d hi m, an d 
he wa sn't t h ere, nobody
 knew about him.   I knew his Abbe
y was in Leufair(ph).  I we nt to 
Leufair( ph) and I was told the y di
dn't know wher e he wa s.  But th
at part , of cours e, now I kno w  
wh ere  he  wa s, t he y did n 't  
tell me where.  And I was 
sort of lost.  And, ho w,
 you can't , you can onl y, 
my ti me wa s  li m
ite d in Europe, I ha d to come ba c k and go bac k to my job, and I neve r found hi m 
agai n, t o my, so, I was not 
able t o see hi m agai n.  
And especi ally i n hi s la ter ye ars , I would ha ve  
love d to have bee n abl e to go see hi m beca use 
he died, unfortunat ely, a 
very sad de ath, he had  
Parkinson's.   

Q: At t he ti me , you didn't have a 
sense t hat t her e were, t hat t here 
wa s a network of pe ople tr yi ng t o  
hide  c hildr en? 

A: No.  I did not know t h at at  all .  

Q: Now, thi s  Msr . Ra us onk( ph) ...

A: Now, Ms r. Raus onk( ph
) I remai ned ver y close cont act with. 
 We  s a w hi m when I went ba ck t o 
Brussel s.  
Q: Wh at, wh at motivated him?   Ho w did... 

A: Msr . Ra usonk(ph) , let  
me tell you something, 
I as ked the sa me questi on of eve ry pers on who 
wa s responsi ble in our re scue , and of anyone, I, w
ho di d any r escue work, eve n when a t  the pre mi er 
of Shindler's  List, I had the oppo
rtunity to speak to Mrs. Shindler
 because what happened i s, I was  
sitting with her and talking and a lady walked over a nd said, will you still talk 
to me after the film?  
And, I , Mr s. Shi ndl er looked, I sai
d, s he di dn't understa nd a word she 
was s aying.  So, I said t o her ,  
if you tell me , I s aid t o Mrs . Shi n dler, spr eke nsie
( ph) kine(ph)  Engli s h?   She sai d , ne uts che( p h),  
spre ke noi(ph) De uts che and Spa nis h.  So, I don't r e
ally, I mea n , I can sur vive in Spa nis h, but I don't  
really s pea k it, but i n Ger ma n I 
ca n mana ge.  So, I said t o the la
dy, I said, who, i f you'll t ell me who  
you are , I 'll be gl ad t o i n terpret 
for you.  So, she says , 
I'm the actress who's play
ing Mr s. Shi ndl er i n 
the fil m.  That was befor e, t here 
was a reception before the film.  
And, so I int erp
r ete d a nd the n I  
turned to Mrs. Shindler after sh
e ha d left, I sai d, you know, Fr au 
Shindler , tell me, i f you, beca use ,  
you know, t hey mini mi z e her  role , a nd it  was much 
larger t h an t he peopl e 
know.  I f you ha d t o do 
toda y, i f you were young toda y, a nd you ha d to do 
what you did, coul d you, 
would you, do it agai n?  
She, I r e member, she went li ke t his, what el se i s 
ther e to do?  If one pers
on can't help another, 
what 's life al l about?   Jus t  like that , very si mpl e.  I want ed to see what s o me one else s aid, beca use  

the a nswer s I got were a l so si mple .  Sister Adoni a( ph) , I re me mber, I 
as ke d her, and s he said, Flora , 
what do you mean, why I did it?   Fo
r the love of God, they're innoce
nt c hil dren.  Period.  No great  
heroi s m ther e, right?  Mo
ther Super i or, what els e
 was one suppose d to do?  
 Father Br uno, he sai d, 
Flor a, why do you ke ep a sking th
a t  question?   I only did what I  
should do.  Msr. Ra usonk(ph), you  
read t he car d.  He t hanked me.  I n stead of we 
tha nke d hi m, he c oul dn't under stand why we 're  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

thanking hi m.  We  
thanked hi m, a nd when, he wr
ote me  thi s c a rd i n 1967, aft e r we  ha d give n hi m a  
gi ft of a wat ch from al l three of
 us .  And, I re cei ve a car d from 
hi m sayi ng, I 'm over whel me d wi th  
all thi s grate f ulne ss  you'r e s howi
ng me.  It i s for me to
 thank you.  And 
he goes on and on and on. 
And t hen I c a lled hi m fr om t he Un
ite d St ates and I said, M sr. Ra us
onk(ph), what kind of nonsense 
are you wr iti ng me  in your 
car d?  What is t his busi
ness  of you should tha nk 
us, you save d our li ves .  
He sa ys, but  you don't under sta nd, 
Flora, you gave me a chance t o 
fi nd out what I wa s ma de of. 
That's how simple it was.  For them.  It wasn't 
simple, but these are people
 who couldn't  see  a not her  
direction.  There was no he
sitation, this is 
wha t  wa s, t her e wa
s a need, t hey did. 
Q: Yeah, I  me an, he, on 
one  ha nd you have  pe ople  who were very
 pious, here you 
ha ve t his  ri ch 
industrialist who actua
lly shepherded you t o
 your hidi ng pla ce s.  He  coul
d have paid people to do it. 
A: No, he di d it  hi ms el f. 
Q: He took the ri sks hi mself. 

A: And yet , fr om a  Catholic poi nt 
of view, he wa sn't  the mo st moral 
of pe ople .  He ha d a mistre ss .  
In fa ct, a fter the war , he wa s, he and his wi fe ar
e  bot h devout Cat holi cs, a n
d, you don't have to ta pe  
this. 

Q: The tape is rolling 
and I don't wa nt to... 
A: Anyway, they were devout Cath
ol ics and s o they ne ver got  divo
rce d.  But , when he wa s ol der  
and ill , he went home a n d his wi fe ca red for hi m 
until he di ed.  That ha d nothi ng t o do, you know, 
with... 

Q: In all these experiences, di d you ever have a 
sense that  peopl e wer e either frightened to or  

resistant to helping you? 

A: In my per sonal experi ence, okay?  Wit h the ex
c eption of Ms r. Raus onk(
ph) 's wi fe, a n d now, who 
fe are d fo r h e rsel f an d h e r  
chil dren, there was an i ncident .  I do

the ta pe or not, where by I wa s 
in M sr . Raus onk( ph) 's home , a nd 
I wa s put  to be d, a nd I hear d Msr . 
Ra usonk(ph)  and M ada me Ra us onk(ph) ar guing in
 the next room.  And I heard her sa ying,  
_____________, you 
wa nt to risk your life?  You can do wh
at ever you wa nt, but you don't ha ve the  
right t o ris k my l i fe a nd my chil dre n 's lives fora couple of Je ws .  And I 
r e me mbe r  ju mp in g ou t o f  
bed and running int o the other r
oom a nd saying, M sr. Ra usonk(ph
) , pl ease I don't wa nt you and 
Mrs. Rausonk(ph), and I wa s sobbing,
 to fight over me, pl ease take 
me ba ck t o my  mo ther,  pl ease  
take me ba c k to my mo ther, I 
don't  want you t o fi ght with Mr
s. Raus onk( ph) for me .  And he 
poi nted his  finger  at me , and went , yo
u, get bac k t o be d!  This is none  of your busine ss !  The voic e  
wa s s o po we rful,  so  a uth or
itarian, I mean, I j ust  ran,
 jumpe d bac k into be d, 
put  the c o vers  over me  
and j ust l aid there sha king.  And ne
ver said another word. 
 But, that was the onl
y ti me t h at I act uall y 
hear d i n wor ds, someone 
say, and, you know, I'm 
a mot her  and I 'm a grandm
other , and I pra y, a nd I  
always sa id to mysel f , God for bid
, if there were ever a need, i f
 so meone knoc ke d on my door and 
said, I 'm bei ng pursued, help me , that  I woul d have 
the courage.  I woul d li ke to beli eve  that I woul d  
have the courage to help, 
but I don't know.  Until th
at mo ment of truth, so 
to speak, I don't think any 
of us reall y know.  But ,  had there been more 
of  that, you woul d have 
had more pe ople living. 
Bec ause, als o, whe n people prot este

backed off.  They we

opl e did not prote st enough. 
Q: Let's just, for a few mi nutes, fini
sh this circle.  Your father sent
 for you, or the 
American Army ... 
A: The Ar my brought us to
 t he United St ates.  Yes. 
Q: And in 1946? 
A: 1946.  M ay 29t h, we  doc ke d i n 
New York, I'll  never forget it. 
Q: Okay.  I want yo
u to tell me a little bit ab
out your impressions upon a
rrival, who was there to

 fairly power ful, or  ma

see your father again.

A: It wa s.  We  hadn't seen hi
m for  ei ght  and a hal f  ye ars .  
Q: So, wh y don't  you tell me 
about  your trip to the United
 State s, your arrival here?  
A: Oka y, when we arrive d, we were met by t wo me n. 
 At t he Port o f Ne w Yo rk .  One wa s very tall ,  
and one was , looke d e xtr e mely s m
all  to me, much small er than 
I had vaguely r e me mbere d, fr o m  
what I had remembered, th
e little one was my father. 
 And I kept looki
ng at him and 
saying, that's 
my father , that 's my father, but I di dn't feel that
 that was my father.  Th
ere wasn't any elati on, I  
re me mber.  We  were a ll so, don't  for get, we were  
all so very tired fr om th
e jour ne y.  And we , ther e  
wa sn't a lull  wher e ther e was sort of a peri od of
 ti me whe r e we rel axe d, were happy, a ll that . 
Because t her e was a struggle and all 
that bec aus e  we al so ha d to go
 from Brussels 
all the way to 
Ovra(ph), a nd t hi ngs  weren't t hat c o mfort able  e
ither .  We  got  st uc k i n Paris , and ther e wa s a 
proble m wit h me, I c oul dn't go ont
o my mother 's pas sport.  And 
the Ar my was al so, ther e was a 
que stion a s t o whe r e c ould I be br
ought as a dependant , because I  
was  pa st 14, some how, a t  tha t  
time , for some  reason, 14 
wa s t he cut-off date .  So, it wa s al ways
, well, we'll let he
r go this far, and  
if they'll let her, pass her, fine
, and it was all th
e wa y int o Ne w York , th at  
it was, okay, she can go  
on t he s hi p, I don't  know if the y 'l l 
let her off the ship.  Okay?  But,
 anywa y, I l ooke d a t  hi m a nd it  
wa s ver y str a ng e.  We  th en ca me  o ut  in Ne w Yor
k, Ne w Yor k was very dirty at tha t  ti me , ar ound  
the port wa s  a lot of gar bage and e v erythi ng, I re me
mbe r , we didn't thi n k we
 liked it .  He hugge d 
each one of us, but I don't rememb
er feeling the sense 
of famil y.  And then
, I remember being 
angr y.  I was  angr y.  Bec ause I felt t h at, well , I ha d so
rt of absorbed my mother
's anger, I think, you 
know.  Then we came, we were a 
large, see , dad had not hing when 
we got here.  Be cause he wa s s o  
sure t hat hi s wi fe a nd chil dren wer e ki lled.  Tha t  he
 didn't re all y pre pare .  I gue ss he ha d for med sort  
of, I gue ss  you ca n c all t hat a depr es
s ion or  so met hing, but,
 like, well, who should
 I real ly work for ,  
kind of thi ng, you know.  So, we
 moved into a fourth 
floor apart ment , no el evat or, one t oilet on the

whole wa y for four a part me nts .  
And, we ha d hot  wat er, but our 
bat ht ub was our kit chen c ounter  
with a cover.  Take the 
cover off.  But, anyway, we settled in
 and, the children, the two children 
took to my dad pretty qui
ckly.  Because they were 
still young and they were 
sent to sch
ool.  And I 
we nt to wor k.  I went t o work i n a  swe atsho
p.  They called it a swea
ts hop, it was actuall y, you 
know, t hey make the bl azers.  An
d at ni ght , I went t o a school  
called the Eron(ph) School.  For  
business.  I think it still exists, 
on 14th Street in New 
York.  And, I 
took English stenography.  I 
didn't r eall y  know Engli sh, but I took Engli sh 
st enogra phy.  Be cause I figure d, I knew by t he n  
French stenography, because t hat 's another  thi ng 
I had studied, I knew how to type.  I knew some  
bookkee ping.  So I  to
ok Englis h ste n ogra phy.  And I tried to kind
 of adjust into life .  Mom we nt to 
work.  She we nt and pre sente d her s
el f as a furri er, they fired her tw
o days l ater, s he was  no furrier . 
Because she hear d you could ear
n good money. She l ear ned so
mething, she then got a job 
somewhere else.  She got fir ed a 
week later, she learned somethin
g.  Wit hi n six mo

furrier .  She  the n le arne d s he c a

mo re  mon e y that  w a y,  s o s he

in a mount of ti me .  Gu
ess who got  elected to

good mone y.  An
d, we  children 
wer e very unha ppy livi n g 
wh ere we wer e  livin g.  Even wit h th

just, al so, we had to lea r n Englis h.  It was , the y
 wer e di ffic ul t ti mes .  And, she says, kids , don't  
worry.  Beca use I wa nt

Bel gium.  I wante d, at  t hat poi

she says, don't worry, I'll ha

A: We  move d t o Quee ns... 
Q: I guess my  question here is, ev
en though you are now fr ee, you'
re in the United 
States, you're, 
you've bee n able  to, I  guess, re- est
ablish yourself, I'm sure there were a lot of adjust me nts you all 
had to go t hr ough?  

A: Well , the r e wer e, ther e 's no questi on.  We c a m e,
 we didn't really know 
the language .  I had the  
privil ege of havi ng had five Eng
lish l essons befor e we 
left .  Because we ne
eded one person wh o 
coul d as k a few que stions .  
So, we, I had five Engli sh les sons, s o
 I wa s elec t ed to a sk the  quest ions, 
where i s thi s  and wher e i s that .  So, t hat was the 
e xtent  of my knowl edge of
 Englis h.  Whe n we, we 
settled in in New York, as
 I said, within a week, 
mom was out looking for wo
rk.  And, so was I. 
We  both got jobs.  Mom 
and I then t a lked and sh
e says, you know what, it
 woul d be a good i dea i f 
you could l e arn a gain, maybe fini sh
 up le arni ng how to ma ke patter ns 
a n d thi ngs li ke  that.  So, I  
found out, with my five wo rds of 
English, that there is a school 
called the High Sc
hool  for Fa shi on  
Industries, or something to that 
e f fec t .  I beli eve a r ound 23r d Street
 in Ne w Yor k.  I ma ke my  wa y 
there and I  enroll  mysel f 
in t his  hi gh sc hool.  And, as  far ,
 when it came to th
e dres s ma king a nd 
thos e part s, I  kne w everything.  However , in the 
other cl ass es , it was a not her story.  I didn't know 
the language, and I remember sitti
ng in a class, and one 
day I was asked a ques
tion, and I couldn't, I 
tried to answer it and, of course, 
I had this deep accent , and my E
ngl ish, of cour se, wa s very poor,  
and I r e me mber ever ybody l aughi ng 
and I got  ve ry ups et t hat  one day.
  And I  just bu
s t out cr ying 
and ran out .  The tea cher  ca me a ft e
r me and, you know, br ou
ght me ba ck i nt o cla
ss.  And then, time  
we nt on, I di d very, I  got  several  hi
gh school cr edi ts fro m the t hings
 t hat  I did know.  And t he n t he  
principal called me in to her offi
c e and she sai d that  I coul d get a  
scholars hip to the 
Fashion Institute  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

of Ne w Yor k.  I didn't know what
 a scholars hip wa s.  I thought it had somet hing to do wit h being a 
scholar , but I didn't fee l  like a sc hol ar.  But, I 
didn't know wh at a schola
r, I di dn't know t hat a  
scholars hip wa s, a s I sai d in Fre nch, _______
__________, whi ch 
wa s mone y to att end a sc hool . 
And, I we nt home a nd I t old
 my mother and father th
at the principal s aid I c oul d get a s c holar shi p.  
My father  knew what a sc
holarship wa s.  But, he 
sa ys, I 'm a  girl and a gi rl
 doesn't need t hat much 
education.  Then they di
scussed it, of course, with
 uncl e a nd the uncle  who sent  his  t wo daught ers t o  
college, didn't think that I needed 
it.  And, I wa s then pulle d out of sc hool and I went to wor k. 
Peri od.  But I we nt bac k t o the Eron(ph) Sc hool an
d took some mo re bookkeep
i ng.  Tha t  I could do  
at night.  Then, I decided once I knew stenography,
 I woul d get  a job and I a pplie d for a j ob with a n  
attorney.  Because I t hen l
earned t hat i n the Unit ed St
ates, it isn't very elegant 
to work i n a shop, t ha t  
you ha ve to wor k in a n  office , to be, quote , s o
met hing.  So, I a pplie d to this a ttor ney, I know 
stenogr aphy in French, I know ste nography i n  
En glish and I know how 
to t ype  and I  know 
bookkee ping.  And he di ctates  hi s fir st lett er a nd I 
type up the letter, I was 
ther e for t hr ee days by 
then, a nd I wr ote t he word subpoe
n a , S- A- B- E- N- A.   Th at 's  the on
ly subpoena I kn
ew.  What ever , 
that 's the end of that job.  I th
en got another j ob.  And a n other 
j ob.  After a while , my Englis h 
i mproved be caus e wha t  happene d is , 
I , as I sai d, I found t eenagers ve
ry frivolous here
.  So, I wa sn't  
comfortabl e wit h them.  Adu
lts  reall y  didn't  want  any part  of me . 
 I wasn't  considered
 an a dult .  So, 
I isolat ed my sel f.  I worked a nd t h
en i n my fr ee ti me, I we
nt t o the li brar y and wit h a di ctionary and 
books that I had as ke d the libraria n to tell me wha t
 I shoul d re ad, I taught 
mysel f Engli sh.  I didn't 
know a ver b  fro m and a dj
ecti ve for , or a topic sentence or an
ythi ng li ke t hat, but I ta ught mys el f 
how to read English.  And I litera
lly photographed linguisti
c structure.  Not realizing that it would  
come in handy late r on. 
 And, e vent ually, I pre s ente d mys el f 
to M. Lowe nstei n( ph)  & Sons.  I 
believe the company still 
exists.  As a bilingual 
secretary.  And, when I 
was asked if I had a high 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
70 
 
school  di ploma , I  sai d, of course .  
And, I got t he  j ob, a nd I re a lized that
 I r eally di dn't 
know a lot, so 
what I did i s , nobody el s e in my 
offi ce knew French, so 
I tol d my boss , I need a dicti onar y.  He  
brought me a dicti onary and I  took 
t h e work home .  I pr ete nde d to do it i n the offic e, I t o ok t he wor k  
home, I worked at 
night, brought the work bac
k, and learned.  I 
ended up staying th
ere until after I  
was married and I didn't leave until
 I was expecting my so
n.  I became a good 
bilingual secretary.  
Of course , I fel t  bad I  ha d lie d by
 t he n, you know, but  y
ou ha d, the t hing i s, I 
did my wor k, I  wor ke d  
very hard.  Then after that, I just
 kept, basically, I work
ed.  I mean, literally, th
at was my life.  My 
home , my fa mil y a nd wor
k.  Then fo r awhile th
ere, my  second child, 
my hus ba nd was  promote d 
and I could be a homemaker for awhile, so  I wa s 
a home ma ker, but  I wa nt
ed certain things, lik e 
music lessons with the be
st of teachers and ever ything t hat wa
s good for my  child
ren, so I started 
using my dre ss making s ki
lls beca use  I didn't  want  
t o le ave  the c hildre n be ca use  I didn't  have  par ent s  
at home and I felt that 
my c hildr en shoul d have a 
mother at home.  But I 
wante d mone y.  So, I  
became a dressmaker again at ho
me.  And when the children we
re i n  school, I worke d as a  
dressmaker.  Meanwhil e, I became
 active in the community.  We li
ved out side of Phil a delphia and 
there was no library in my children
's ele ment ary s chool, s o I volunteer ed t o set one up.  I set up a 
librar y.  My hus ba nd ha d a de cent job, but, I want ed
 more.  And I tol d hi m 
t o le ave  his job a nd go 
and t r y out f or a not her one.  And hi s  father  sai d, 
no, you ha ve a j ob, you 
stay put, you don't go 
chasing after birds in the sky.  And I said there'
s  onl y one  wa y, I s a id, we 'r
e young, we can do it, 
well  anywa y , ti me went on a nd we ma de it .  An
d then, but meanwhile, I 
ne ver had a hi gh school 
dipl oma.  When my s on 
was, there were two inci
dent s that dr ove me to i mprove mys elf i n oth e r  
areas.  One of t hem was, 
I st ill had a fai rly deep 
accent  and I didn't  reali ze 
to what  degree because 
my  husband never said anyt
hing.  Once i n a w hile  people  woul d ki
nd of ma ke fun, 
but by that time, 
it didn't bother me that much. 
 One day my little one came home fr
om fi rst grade crying.  And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
71 
 
thought s o mebody ha d beaten hi m 
up, a nd he said, plea se, mommy, 
whe n you c o me t o school , don't  
talk.  Everybody s ays y
ou tal k funny.  So, 
my child wasn't  goi ng t o be  an outsi der, so I sta r te d  
worki ng wit h my husba
nd and i mpr ovi ng my accent , that 's wh
y I have a New Yor k  accent .  And 
fi ghti ng my acce nt, t hat wa s one th
i ng.  Then one day, I re alized
 t hat s o meday t he childr en are  
goi ng to as k me i f I ha ve, if ma mma has a high school
 di ploma .   And I didn't want t o ha ve to lie t o  
my chil dren.  So, I went  to see 
my, but , you know, 
there was one element in 
all this, is that I ,  
basic ally, I wa s ver y much of a loner.  I di d th
ings.  Li ke , I, as I sai d, I bec a me  part of the  
communit y, I wor ked at  t he school
 as a volunteer at th
e library, I, at  the sy
na gogue  I vol unteere d, I  
beca me  a  de n mother  a n d all  
that, but, yet, I wa s a lone
r.  I had no time  for fr
iendships.  But, I think 
it wa sn't s o much that I had no ti
me, I think I had bec o me s o c o mf
ort able  going my own way, going 
all the way back when t h e 
childre n l a ughed at me  a fter  sc hool  an
d I  is olate d mysel f.  I worke d a nd 
started teaching myself En
glish.  That it became a 
pattern.  In fa ct, I'm 
still accused of being a  
worka holi c.  I 'm s uppose d to be re
tired, but I work all th
e ti me.  And I t hink you de vel op a patt ern .  
But , anyway, I went t o se e my littl e gi rl 's ki nder gar
ten teacher a nd I said, look, t his is be twe en us, I  
wa nt to tell you somet hi ng, ma ybe y
ou ca n hel p me .  Se e, be caus e  I had t a lke d to my hus ba nd, my  
hus ba nd kept sayi ng, Fl ora, you're a s mart girl , y
ou don't ha ve to prove a nyt hing to a nybody, you 
don't nee d it.  But , I wa nt ed it. 
 So, s h e says, you c an get a hi gh sc
hool dipl oma t w o ways.  She says,  
I know t hey are giving some exams 
at  Templ e Uni versit y to vet erans.  You can get what  they cal l  a 
Ge neral  Education Dipl oma .  Or , 
s he  says, you c an ta ke clas s es. 
 She says, but , 
you know what, 
why don't  you ta ke t he  te st, 
if you fail it, you'
l l  ta ke cla sses .  So, I  we nt 
and I t ook t he exam and, it  
wa s, a fter that, it wa s a series of exa ms .  And I t
ook t he m and then I was supposed t o come ba ck t o  
fi nd out  the  result s a nd, I  get a  di ploma .  And I 'll
 never forget , the  man who 
handed it to me says, 
well , Mrs . Singer , what are you goi ng to do with 
this?   What  a m I goi ng to
 do with this?  Who's  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356

goi ng to be my e qual?   I've got a high school 
di ploma!  You know?   So
, by the n my hus ba nd was  
more successful, we wer e abl e t o
 live  in our  own home  
alre ady, you know, things
 like that.  So , that, 
that 's it .  We  we nt out  to dinner , he  wa s s o pr
oud of me and all that. 
 Anywa y, ti me goes  by. 
Q: You have  how ma ny c hildre n?  
A: I have t w o c hildr en a nd four gr
andchil dre n.  Ti me  we nt by.  
We, e vent ually, my husba nd went  
into his own business and wh en my so
n was in his fir st ye ar of colle ge
, it was either the last year of 
high school or the fir st year of c ollege.  One 
day we were tal king about c ours es a nd c r edits a n d  
things li ke t hat a nd he s ays , y
ou know, mo m, he says , how c o me y
ou ne ver we nt ba c k to s chool?  
He s ays, you're al wa ys pushi ng educ ation.  How co
me you ne ver we nt ba c k 
to s chool?   I said, me, 
at my a ge?   I'm old.  I was only 3
9.  I don't even know i f I was quite 
39 at that point , 
but I felt ol d.  I  
said, I 'm ol d, I said.  Sur e, he s ays , s chooling, 
e v erybody's gotta go to s chool , you got t a, lear ning 
never stops exce pt for you, r i ght?  
 We ll, I didn't sleep all ni ght , the 
next  day I prese nted mysel f at  
Ameri can U, because by th
e n we li ved here .  And, I s aid I n
eed to speak to some one who could 
advise me on college.  
And I kind of give 
a little background 
and the counselor sa
ys, well, I'll tell 
you what , I 'l l  give you a  stack of
 books .  Ta ke t he m home, read 
the m, c o me ba ck, we 'll di scus s  
them and I'll tell you if 
you're college material.  
I did.  Came back.  Mean
while, I had built, helped 
my hus ba nd buil d a  busi ness, we ha
d a ba gel  ba ke ry a nd all tha t , you 
know?   An d, I read the books. 
I ha d re ad every one  of the m.  T
hos e wer e the books I ha d re ad duri n
g my hours in the library.  But 
I re-read t hem t o make sure t h
at I knew what I was 
talking about.  I cam
e  ba ck, we talked, no 
que stion, you ca n make i t .  I sai d, 
we l l , how woul d I go a bout it .  She 
s ays , well , you ca n come  in a s 
a speci al student , i f you do C or be tter, you ca n 
ma triculat e.  So, I we nt home a n d I told my  
hus ba nd, I wa nt to go t o colle ge .  And he says , Fl
ora, why are you al ways tr ying to prove thi ngs?  
And I s aid, no, I  jus t , I wa
nt to do this, I said, I want to give
 an exampl e to the 
children.  So, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
73 
 
fi nanciall y, it was more  conve nie n
t  for me  t o go t o Mont gomer y 
College.  So, I enrolled in  
Mont gome ry Colle ge and I fi nished
 up there and t hen 
there was a scholar shi
p for wo men.  It was 
right after t h at that Horizons for 
Wo me n ca me  o ut, re me mb e r ?   Starte
d going ba ck t o school .  But ,  I 
had started it just a little be
fore.  To make a long st
ory short, they had a scho
larship to Maryland that 
was offered to wo
me n.  And I was one of t he c andi date s. 
 But, then it wa s ba
se d on ne ed and, 
fortunately, by then, I didn't have
 a need.  So, another 
woma n got i t .  A mi norit
y woma n.  So, I we nt 
to Maryland anyway.  And I fi nish
ed up my degree, fi ni
shed Magna Cum Laude,
 believe it, I still  
can't believe it.  An d, now, again, 
I get a surprise party. 
 My professors are invi
t ed and all that .  And 
at that poi nt, I a dde d my mai de n 
name again as a mi ddle 
name, because I felt th
at my father  woul d  
have wa nte d  that.  Beca use there 's no one els e to 
carry hi s na me .  But, that wa s the e nd of it , you 
know?   Agai n... 
Q: So, do you t hink your hus ba nd 
was  right, that you ha d t his  c o mp
ell ing ne ed t o prove  yours el f?  
A: I don't know.  It 's a 
good questi on.  Beca use wh
at happened, what 's inte
resti ng, my husband is  
the one who changed, not me
.  What happened was, aft er the su
rprise part y, I didn't know, but he  
had gotte n s o me tickets t o take me on a vac ation. 
 And, being I had been 
so busy between helping 
him and going to sc
hool and studying, a
nd all, and taking care of the 
children still, even though they  
wer e adoles c ents now, he  kept co
mplaining.  See, the th
i ng i s, he ke pt c o mplaining throughout t he  
years t hat I wa s goi ng t o  college, we coul dn't go ou
t bec aus e I had t o study for tests or write a paper 
or whatever.  But, anyway, this was it.  I'm in
 t he house , I had gone out shoppi ng t o get a fe w 
clothes for my vaca tion.  And I 
get a  phone call a nd it was Jac k, an
d he sa ys, my hus band, he sa ys ,  
Flor a, ar e you standi ng or sitting down?   I says, 
why, who die d, who got hurt?  Anyone got hurt ?  
Anyone s i ck?   He says, why does i t
 always ha ve  to be bad news?   
He sa ys, no, sit down i f you'r e  
standing.  And, so I sat do
wn, he sa ys , how would you 
li ke to go to gradua te 
school a n d teac h at the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356  
74 
 
Uni ver sity of Ma ryla nd?   I said, what?   He says
, yes , they wai ve d the GRE's a nd you ca n go to 
graduate  s chool , not only are n 't  you going t o have 
to pay, they'r e going to 
pay you, and you'll teach. 
I said, well, I can't do t h at to you, I s aid, you know
, it 's not fa ir.  He sa ys, how ca n you re fuse it?  
Meanwhile, that same week
 what ha d ha ppe ne d i s, a frie nd of mi
ne ha d bought out a , actuall y, no, 
she hadn't bought it out yet, she had 
gotten a job a s a guide , a t our gui
de.  And they offered me a jo b 
also, beca us e of my linguist ic s k
ills.  And I had accepted it, bu
t I hadn't gone down yet to get 
fi nge rpri nte d  for t he li cense a nd all t h at, a nd I s aid
, a nd not  onl y that, I  sai d , I al rea dy pr omise d t o 
take thi s job.  He sa ys, Fl ora,  how ca n you c o mpar e the t wo?   Ho
w c an you, you c an't turn it down. 

I says , but, J ack, do you know what
 t hat means?  That
 me ans again, homework,
 and papers and all  
that, I sa ys, I won't be a ble to go out.  He said, 
so what?   So, anyway, I  went back t o graduate  
school , I ta ught at  Mar yl and t hre e ye ars. And t he n 
they offered me a j ob i n 
Baltimore.  And, I took  
it and the n my hus ba nd talked me out of it be caus e
 he felt it was just such a big trip to go to  
Baltimore all the time .  
And, I sent a vitae to the local colleg
es , but then, a frie nd of my hus ba nd  
who works i n the count y, 
they needed a French t
eacher at Ei nstei n High 
School, called, said t hey 
had an ope ni ng, would I t ake it?   
I sa i d, me  teac h high sc hool?   
My hus ba nd sa ys , look I know you, 
come Sept e mber you're goi ng to be
 unhappy i f you don't do anyt hin

and a fe w days a fte r I had, a ft er I had signe d the 
contr act, I  got an offer , there was a positi on at  
Ge orgetown, part-ti me .   But , of c our se, I  ha d si
gned the cont ract.  And 
I love d worki ng wit h t h e  
high school kids.  It was like, lite
rally, a fish going into water.  I 
just loved working with the kids, 
and I  sta ye d.  Sta ye d wit h Brita nnia and ended 
up retiri ng from Wa lt Whi t ma n Hi gh School.  And 
some nice  t hings happe ned to me
, t oo.  I e nded up goi ng back t o
 Maryland as what they call  a

I just went to a we dding of one of my fo rmer

So, s o me r ea l  nice  thi ngs  happe ned

life.  I have children that 
I 'm proud of.  I  ha ve gra ndc hildr en t hat
 I adore a nd fi nd a 
lot of joy in.  I 
have a wonder ful man t hat
 I ' m ma rr ied t o.   So , I

I do ha ve  to earn that,  
perhaps , yea h.  That , i f I ' m alive, I ca n't  
waste that life, if that ma kes any sense. 
Q: What, are ther e other l ong ter m effects t hat  yo

i mpacte d on your lat er li f e?  
A: Okay. Le t me give you, 
let me tell you, y

 I will not risk getting stuc

hus ba nd's, I rene w for hi m.  But , whi c h is stupid
, beca use he 's  an Ameri ca n you know, and I 'm an 
American today, too.  My citizen
ship is my most preci

Because, you know, I don't

they feel so comfortable and so fre

 think I'm still ob

is a fo olish obsessio

Q: So, you still don't 
feel entirely safe ? 
A: No, I never feel e ntire l y sa fe.  I

thing that ne ver has gone
 away.  I f I  a m stopped by a  police m a

with policeman commun

  But, there is still,
 in an offi cial capac

a policeman, my whole insides shake.  Literally, 
sha ke.  Ther e 's j ust so
mething, I got  stoppe d, I  
didn't get a ticket, but I got stopped by a policeman
 once, and his voice was a little louder than it 
should ha ve bee n.  And I  
could not  come  up with a 
voice d a ns wer .  I  finall y di d, but I wa s s haki ng.  
So, there are these things, alright?  
If I see a pair of boots
, I still get affected.  
We  had an incident.

 So , I don't know exactly.  My

into the city, we visit ed a  coupl e of the mu seu ms,
 we ate at the  National 
Ar t Galler y, the little cafe 
they have there.  And it 
was one of t hese per fect  da

and I 'll liste n to a lecture .  I'm fi ne as l ong a s I '
