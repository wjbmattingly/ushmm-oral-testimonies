On thism ap of Polandthe arrow indicates the location of Dokszyce. As partof anagreem ent with 

Nazi Germ any, the Soviet Union occupied Dokszyce in Septem ber1939.  Germany invaded the 

Soviet Union in 1941.When Germ an SS and policebeganm ass killings of the Jews in Dokszyce in 

1942 Rachel and herfam ily went into hiding.A shorttim e later, Rachel™s brother was discovered by 

the Germansand killed. Rachel and her mother sought shelter in the ghetto in Glebokie, a town North
 

of  Dokszyce. T he second arrow on our mappoints to Glebokie.
 
 

Here we see a synagogue in the Glebokie ghetto. Rachel's Mother joined a group of partisans inthe 

forest outside of Glebokie and becam e their cook with Rachelas her assistant. In the late sum
m e r  of  
1944, Dinaand Rachel m arched with partisans to theSoviet lines where they were liberated.
 
Af ter liberation, Rachel and Dina left Polandfor Italy where they stayed in the Santa Cesarea 

displaced persons' cam p.  T he arrow points to the Santa Ceserea displaced persons' cam p in 

southern Italy.
 
 

Here we see Rachel and her mother atthe Santa Cesarea displaced persons' camp.

Bef ore you talkaboutwhat happened to youand yourfam ily during the war and during theHolocaust, 
let's startf irst with you telling us a littlebit about yourf am ily, your com munity, and yourself bef ore the 

wa r .
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: I lived in a small town onthef ar eastern
 
--
 
northeastern part of Poland.  At that tim e 
it was Poland.  It wasfour kilometersf rom the Russianborder.T he town was a ver y vital onefor the 

Jewish com munity. T he Jewish comm unity consisted of about2,500 people
, a
pproxim ately 48, 49% 
of  the town.  They wer e engaged in business.  Som e were farm ers. My parents were in business.  My 

father was a butcher by profession,althoughhe did more than that. He also supplied the garrison.  

T here was a Polish m ilitary outpostbecause it was so close to the Russianborderand he also 

engaged in some exports of orchards were nearby so he wouldexport apples.  Heexported of  all 

things pigs, which are forbiddenfor Jews.  And alsof lax which was used to make ropes. T hef lax 

seeds were used tomake oil.
 
My m other was also engaged in business.  She hada yard goods store, here you would call it af abric 

store. There were nostores that yo
u bought ready
-
m ade clothing.You didn't go to Macy's or 
Bloom ingdale's or Nordstrom'sor wherever.  So people would buy thefabrics.  Some would sew their 

own clothes and som ewould use seam stresses.  A lotengaged intailoring and the wom enbeing 

seam st
resses.  Mother traveled to buy m aterials toW arsaw
 
--
 
actually Vilna was the first stop, then 
W arsaw andthen afterwards Lodz.  They wer e manufacturers of fabrics.
 
W elived a very comf ortable life with help in the house, tutorsf orus. I startedm y educa
tion rather 
early.  My m other told m e by the ageof  three I could read. That'sprobably what helpedme get 

through the schoolshere, too.  Unfortunately, ever ything cam etoa stopor pretty much to a stop.  

First with the Russian occupationbecause the Soviets considered us " bourgeois"  I guess is the word 

in Frenchand we did not have the 
--
 
the same type of life that we had.

>>Bill Benson:Letmeturn to that, just a couple of  questions.  You very sadly lost your f ather before 
the war, early.  He died in 
193 7.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: 1937after a trip to the border with Germany.  He cam eback very broken
-
hearted 
because he said you could hearhum an criesf rom  cattle cars.  And couldn'tf igure out whatit was.  He 

seemed to be ailing af ter that, f rom  m y m other's re
ports, anddied in1937.  Mother continued with the 

business and she was the m ainstay of  thefam ily.
 
>>Bill Benson: You told me that youalso
 
--
 
because you were so young when your father died you 
don't remember a lotabout him but you were telling m eaboutone tim e you remem ber going with him  

to buy applesby the Russianborder.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Yes.
 
>>Bill Benson:W ouldyou share that with us?
 

>>Rae Goldf arb: Father
 
--
 
this is onething that I remem ber, sim ply because there was some event 
there that kindof  left an im pressionon me.  Father tookme along tovie w an orchard whichwas ri ght 

on the Russian border.  And in theevening, as we were sitting outside, we could hear theRussians 

on theother sideplaying accordions and harm onicas and singing acertain song that kindof  stayed 

with m e.  AndI rem ember that event particularl y. 
 

>>Bill Benson: Rae,ofcourse as you began to tell us, all of that changed with the war.  Nazi Germ any 

attacked Poland on Septem ber1,1939. TheRussians attackedf rom  the east 
17
 
--
 
16 days later on 
the17th of Septem ber, and they quickl y occupied your town.  You were just seven years old.  How did 

your lif e changeonce the Soviets were there? 
 

>>Rae Goldf arb: You said seven years old. My docum ents will show m e two years older.
  
But there 
was a reasonfor that.
 
>>Bill Benson:And I hope you'll talkaboutthat.

>>Rae Goldf arb: Yes. But what happened
 
iswhen theGermansf irst came inand the tanks entered 
the town, they
 
--
 
a lotof people were joyous because the Russianswere oppressive.  TheRussians 
singled out certain people asbeing less thanwhat
 
--
 
what their ideaof  comm unists were.  If  you were 
in business, you wereconsidered notaf riend of  comm unism .T hat's thebest way I can put it.  Idon't 
want to be derogative.
 
>>B
ill Benson:As youexplained earlier, of  course yourf ather was gonebut your m other continued 
thebusiness.  You were considered bourgeois. W hatdid that mean?
 

>>Rae Goldf arb:W hat did thatm ean?  According to the comm unists you had to share.  If you had
 

m orethan what they considered was proper,then they could take itaway f rom you. And supposedly 

gi ve it to the poor. Those of  you whohave studiedhistory and someof  you that will study history, you 

wi ll f indoutthat they form ed collectorfarm s, having the people work for most of it going tothe state, 

having ver y l ittle rewar d.  T hey basically tookaway the landf rom  those that hada lot of  it and settled 

thefarmers tobe their slaves.  T hat's thebest wa y I can explain it. Wehad am anufacturing s
to re .  
My m other very quick l y distributed a lotof  thefabrics topeoplethat she dealt with and livedin the 

area to hide itf rom the Soviets and the arrangem entsf orher with them  was, they wi ll use what they 

neededfor them selves and they will let her have what she needsforherself  and in trade she would be 

able to get food f or us, for our necessities. 
 

>>Bill Benson: Rae, the Russiansalso conf iscated personal thingsfrom  you.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Oh, yes.  They conf iscated
 
--
 
that I rem em ber. W e had
 
--
 
my
 
m other ormy f ather, 
oneof  them  brought back an alarm clock and that was really a novelty at that time. And the Russians 

we r e
 
--
 
they were crazy about
,  
they called it chussee (phonetic), and it m eansalarm clocksandI 
rem em ber a soldier strapped itonto hisarm with m y m other's silk stocking.
 
>>Bill Benson: Like a watch.

>>Rae Goldf arb: Some things stickout.  My m other brought back silk lingerie.  T hey conf iscated that 
and Russian wom en paraded in them  inthe streets. They thought of them as gowns.  That I 

rem em ber.  Andof  course, all that changedf or the worst.
 
>>Bill Benson:And Rae, before we go on to the next occupation, you
 
--
 
with the comm unists trying to 
indoctrinateeverybody into comm unism , yousaid that youhadthis
 
--
 
there was aperiod where you 
hadthis senseof  wanting to belong.  Can you tell usa littlebit aboutthat?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Okay.  I'm glad you rem inded me about it. I went to a Jewish or Hebrew school to 

start with.  I was enrolled at the ageof  three,believe it or not. It was fortunatef orm ebecause I got a 

little m ore education than I wouldhave gotten otherwise.  T he Russians came in andof  course that 

school was closed and we went toa Russianschool. The Russian school started out right away an 

indoctrination and they
 
had a system of progressing children into the comm unist party.  They started 
out with children tobepioneers.  Pioneersf or comm unism , I guess.  Andthe sym bolfor itwas 

wearing a red scarf  with a sym bol of the
 
--
 
I don't rem em ber what the sym bol was.  I think it was the
 
--
 
the sickle, I think. I don't know.  Anyway, you wore it on your shirtsand that signaledthatyou were a 

m em ber.  Of course, Ihada diff icult tim ebecom ing am ember because of my mother's status. So the 

only wa y to becom eam em ber was to excel in school, which Im anaged and got my red scarf.  My 

m other thought it was a good ideabecausem aybe we will not be deported. Severalf am ilies were 

deportedtoSiberia.We only wished we were one of those.
 
>>Bill Benson:And Rae, as youbegantotellus, of course, things got profoundly worse once the 

Germ ans cam e.  In June 1941 they turned on the Soviets andattacked the Soviet Union. Germ any 

entered your town in 1941.  By theend of 1941 they forced youand your f amily andotherfam ilies i
n 
your town in Dokszyce into a ghetto. Tell uswhat that was like. Tell us about that tim eand those 

circu m st an ce s.

>>Rae Goldf arb:W hen the Germ ans occupied us, thef irst
 
--
 
the  f irst p a rt th at we
 
--
 
what we reali zed 
that something bad was going to happen was when all the Jews had to wear an arm band,a white 
arm  band with a yellow star on it. I rem em ber that all I wanted to wear was a white blouseso when I 

wore the arm band it would not show toom uch.  But it was very shor tly thereaf ter when it was 

re
quired that we wear
 
--
 
hada yellow star sewn onto all our clothing,inner clothing and outer clothing, 
on the left side in the f rontand the right side in the back.  So that you could be identif ied as com ing or 

going. W alking onthe sidewalk was a tricky
 
thing because anytim e som ebody non
-Jewish 
approached we had tostepoff  into the gutter. Poland being asfar northeast as it was, wint er started 

in aboutOctober and lasted until Easter time, which m eant thatthere was snow and whenthe snow 

m e lt ed  a lit
tle bit because of traffic going through, it was m ud.  So you had to basically stepoff  into 
m ud. T hat was degrading.  Butthe worst part was when we were herded into a ghetto. And what 

was a ghetto?  Unlikewhat you hear inthe UnitedStates,a ghettobeing anarea where people live 

and referredtoas sort of  a ghetto, segregated.  A ghetto was like aprison.  It hadfences, it had 

watch, watchm en around.  You couldn't leave, you couldn't com e inwhen you
 
--
 
when you were 
outside.  If you were caught, you gotthe shotgun. 
 
Asidef rom  that, the population were also turning on the Jewish people. T here were some that were 

helpful.  Mother would som etimes sneak out in clothing, like thef arm ers and put throughsom ef ood 

and sometimes they had a hard time gettingback in. T hey had to work or wait f or work detail.  

Ever ybody had to appear in them orning in the synagogue yard.  The synagogue happened
 
--
 
the 
synagogues were centered, there were, I don't know, three orf our synagogues and they were 

centered around aplaza. T here were two plazas that I remember. One was where the churches 

were and one where the synagogues were.  And of course them arket. T he market was near the 

churches.  So the ghetto was formedaroundwhere the synagoguewas.  I have amap of it if anyone

is interested later.  People were counted. T he Nazis had an obsession with counting. T hat's wh y you 
see numbers on someof  the people on their arm s.  Because they kept track of  Jews by num bers.  In 

our part of the town that never happened,becausethey never intendedto take us anywhere.
 
Slowl y but surely they startedto weedout som eof  thepeoplef rom the ghetto. T hose that worked, 

those that were able to work were takento work details. Since it was a garrison town or they had 

m ilit a ry b
arracks, the Nazi's occupied them ilitary barracks andthey took Jewish details there to work.  
T hey needed laundresses, they needed cleaning of  the stalls, tending to their horses, preparing their 

food.  Andof  course shine their boots. T heyhadanobsessionabout shiny boots. They also counted 

thepeople that cam eback.  If anybody did not adhere to orders, they never cam e back.  You can well 

guess what happenedto them.  Some of them  were beaten and som eof  them  were just shot.
 
>>Bill Benson: Rae, you told me that if they counted we'll say 50f ora work detail and somebody 

escaped while they were on the work detail and 49 cam e back, what was the penalty f or that?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: T he penalty f or
 
--
 
that they extractedf rom the people in the ghetto was ten for one. 
Shot inf ront of the rest of  thepopulation of the ghetto. T hose
 
--
 
som epeople volunteered, older 
people, theyf igured their lif e isatanend anywa y, nothing is going to help them survi ve, volunteered.  

T hey didn't want it. The Germ ans organized the ghetto in sucha way that they appointed a 

comm ittee andthe com m ittee was responsiblef or tending to their needs, tothe Germ an needsand 

controlling everything in the ghetto.  You would hear ref er to ina town asa marshaland his del
 
--
 
>>B i l l
 
Benson: His deputies?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb:T heysupposedly led the Jews them selves, however, the governing themselves was 

to supply the Germ ans with what they needed. T hey extractedm oney, they extracted valuables, they 

extracted any kind of m etal.  A lotof  the cooking utensils were brass or copper. They wanted those.  

And this comm ittee was supposed to collect it and deliver it.

>>Bill Benson: Rae, it just sohappened thatwhen the ghetto wasform ed it wasf ormed in thearea 
where your f am ily home was.  And as they began to shrink the ghetto, as you put it, begin taking away 

all butthe able
-
bodiedandthe num bers were reduced, you hada unique hiding place. W illyou tell us 
about your hiding place and how you used it? 
 
>>Rae Goldf arb:T he ghetto was being
 
shrunk in several
 
--
 
several tim es. Thef irst time they took 
away som e people, they said they are taking them  to a larger ghetto and that was the excuse. They 

hadeverybody collected and then they picked a certain number of people and took them  awa y.  A
nd 
of  course they took them
 
--
 
there was a pit, asand pit where they took the Jews and basically 
m achined them downand covered them with sand and then it was quietf or a while and then they did 

it again.  Andthe ghetto was shrunk tof ewer people andfewer space.  Our house was situated in 

such a way it was a gatedareaf ronting the street. Them ain streets were the best location and our 

house had a gatebetween the two businesses, m yf ather andm y mothers and the housewas in the 

back and so was the
 
--
 
I would call it the barn, the warehouse, I don't know what you would call it.  
Now you would depict it as a warehouse.  Basically a barn.  And there was a wall between the barn 

andthe house, sort of to
 
--
 
to give it som e empty space in between. Access was throughan attic.  
And that used to be used as sort of a saf ef ordocum ents andother things for the house.  
 
Af ter reviewing m y m other's documents, I realized thatm y grandfather
 
--
 
herf ather, was wit h us in the 
gh e tto
 
--
 
hadarrangeda way f or us to get inand also som e suppliesso when they had thiskind of 
shrinking of  the ghetto, that's where we would  hideuntil things got quiet again.  I know thedate 

becausem y m other recorded it.  It was May 5thor so or
 
--
 
thatthey started the last liquidation 
of  t he  
ghettoand they collected allof  thepeople and atthat point the realization was that something bad 

was going to happen.My m other,m y brother and I and some otherpeoplef rom thehouse, whoever 

could, got into the hiding place. My grandm other,m y m other'sm other was with us in thehiding place.

My grandfather wasn't.  And we realized
 
--
 
or I should say I was justa f ollower, butf rom  m y m other's 
m em oirs I readthat we stayed in this hiding placefor eight to ten days, until itbecame totally qui
e t.  
My m other could hear the looting, destructionof  property in ourhouse.  Mostly looting. Also they 
were digging around the housebecausetheybelieved that every Jew had a lot of  goldand they
 
--
 
they buried it.  So they were com ing with shovels and axes and trying to look for it. So there was 

constantactivity.  Final ly, I think it was abouteight days later, it quieteddown.  My grandf ather also 

hadpreparedanotherhiding placeunder a woodenf loor, excavated it, and we got outf rom that hiding 

pl
aceand we thought it was quiet, that it was all f inished.  And it was daylight and realized it wasn't.  
Some of the people
 
--
 
m y m other,m y brother, and I were thef irst ones out, Ithink, and we hid under 
th e
 
--
 
under thef loor in that particular excavated area, call it abunker, whatever you want to call it.  
Also three children,from  what I rem ember, got in with us. My gran dm other was caught com ing out
 
--
 
down f rom the attic.  My m other very quickl y c overed the boardsf rom  thef loor andheldon to them
.  
And they asked m y grandmother where are the rest? My grandm other said thateverybody is gone, 

she's the only one that was hiding in theattic.  And it was quiet af terthat when they tookmy 

grandm other.  And when m ight f ell, m y m other took us on the es
cape.
 
>>Bill Benson:Andf rom there you crossed the river that
 
--
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: From there we crossed the river.  One sideof  the ghetto was theBerezina River.  

Butf irstm other tried to cross a different way and shefound that it wasn't safeenough, de
cided
 
--
 
we  
usedtobathe inthe river.  She knew exactl y where there was shallow r i vers.  Shetook m ybrotheron 

her shouldersand meby the hand and the other children were on their own and we crossed the river, 

only to be stopped by a guard.  Mother had

church. W emanagedto get to her house. She was af raidtohideus becauseeverybody k new the 

connectionbut she offeredm y m other to go to the town to see what happenedtom y brother.  She 

said if  you
 
--
 
if  he's still there, if  he's alive, she'll try to get him , say that she raised him like her own 
and shehasno children and she would like
 
to have him.  She cameback andtoldus thathe was got.  
Andm y m otherhadthe day recorded as May 8, 1942. 
 
From  there we continued on at night,hiding in thef ields or theforest, until we reached anotherf am ily 

that was half way betweenm y hom etown of  Dokszyce and Glebokie which was a larger ghetto. W e 

knew Jews were still there.  She was af raid to keep us,for the samereason, because neighbors 

would tell onneighbors, even though they had no gainf rom it.  However, she diddressm y m other in 

her clothing, m e in herdaughter's clothing and sent her sonas if  going to them arket, tookus in a 

wagon and letus off in them arketplace in the city of  Glebokie.
 
>>Bill Benson:So there you were actually inanother ghetto in Glebokie.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb:T here we waited until evening when people were com ing backf rom  work and joined 

in with the returning Jews from  their assignmentsof  labor into the ghetto. Wehad no papers.  And if  

you didn'thave any papers in the ghetto, youcouldn't work.  If  you couldn't work, you didn't go outon 

work details.  I needn't tell you what the verdict was.
 
My m other hada lotof acquaintances there and oneof  theacquaintanceshad losta daughter inone 

of  those supposed transfers toother ghettos. He was invol ved with the committee that governedthe 

ghetto. Hadthe daughter had the docum entsthey wouldn't have taken her.  She lef t them at home.  

Fortunatefor me because Ihad docum ents.

actually they m adem e
 
a little older.  Mother was very 
inventive in wa ys to try to save us.  So the girl's docum ents were such that she could go out on work 
details. And Ihad learnedhow to tie the threads on

spinning threads because the Nazis, the 
Germ an Arm y was ver y cold.  They weren't used to the climates, sothey needed a lot of gloves, 

socks, and scarves and hats.  I learned to knit scarves so thatm y mother couldproduce. Iwent out, 

outside the ghettoforwork.  Mother stayed in the ghetto,produced scarves.
 
>>B i l

did she do that?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Mother had a lot of acquaintancesamongst thepopulation, thenon

Jewis h 
population and the sole report of  it is som eof us would have probably hid us but they were af raid of 

their neighbors because neighbors

the Nazi s had offered five kilo sugar for exposing a Jew.  Sugar 
was a ver y sought

wanted to escape. Hetold her where the partisans were, and she asked him if  she couldobtain a 

gun.  She hadhiddensom e of our valuablesandm othertoldhim  whatever it costs, getme a gun.  He 

cam e back two weeks later tothe marketplace, Mother was watching f or him, and she got the gun.  

He put it ina basket with som eeggs, eggs on topbecause the Nazis were very cleanliness 

co n scio u

when we lef tthe ghetto in a basket.

they called it, m y moth

I think it was m y m other's cousin, I don't know.  A distant cousin was a 
photographer,anexcellent photographerandthe Nazis sethim up in a house outsideof  the ghetto so 

he could takephotographs.  He did beautiful portraits.  I showed Billa portrait he took of m y m other 

af ter the war.  And they asked
 
--
 
they toldhim  thatparticularnight thathe should stay in the house.  
He should get outof  the ghetto and stay in the house.  Hehadto return to the ghetto every night.  He 

told m other and I we
 
should com e with him.  Mother dressedagain in her clothing andm e in the 
clothing, and we started out with him ,following him  a shortdistancebehind out of the ghetto.  Some 

Jewish wom en started to say hmmm , she thinks she's going to get awa y with it, they won't recognize 

her.  Motherm adem ego with him , f ollow him, and she stayed in the ghetto.  T he next day af ter the 

m assacre that tim e, we returnedto the ghetto andfortunately m y mother survi ved andIf oundher.  

Af ter that, Mother decided that's it,
 
we've got to get out. She contacted some people.  She f igured she 
has to have not just the gun, shehas to have something else with her in order tobeaccepted.W ho 

would want a wom anand a child?T here was a doctor therethat was also interested in getting away.  

He and a couple of others and decided that they were going to m ake a breakf or it.  Unfortunately 

som e others got windof  it andhad it just been our sm all group, maybe we would have made it and 

m aybe we wouldn't have got shot at thefence. T hey did makea tunnelunder the barbedwi re f ence 

so that they could crawl out intoanarea thatwas close to the woods and makea runfor it.  The

people that kind of realized what was going on there went ahead ofus and really drew attentionto 
them selve
s. T hey crawled out and we heard the shots.  Needlessto say, we stayed behind.
 
Af ter that it was just my motherand I to do the escape.  And again,onm arket day, Mother dressed 

m e, dressed herself ,and we lef t with the work details and we kepton walking.  Kepton walking. W e 

actually got a ride, I don't remem berf rom  whom orf or what, some of the distancebecause it would 

have been a very long walk, and we m anaged to get to the villages that were at the end ofa very 

densef orest, not toofar awa y that
 
she knew that's where the partisans were hiding.  And we 
m anaged to get to them . Since Motherhada gun, she was a welcom e, a welcomedperson.

She says you'll teach m e.  However, she says, I'm anexcellent cook.  It was a sm all group of  about 

20, they were af orward group,and their mission was to underm ine the progress to the Russianf ront.  

Oneof  thepeople there, the leaderof  the group was actually som ebody thatescapedf romthe 

prisoners. I should tell you this, thatthe Nazis

they planned very
 
well on how to exterm inate the 
Jews and other groups that they f elt weren'tm easuring up to their standards. But one of the things 

thatthey did was the Russians

the RussianArm y basically laid down their weapons andbecam e 
prisoners of war.  They didn't wanttof ight. They were hungry, they were tattered, they wer e told to 

f ight, they were

shoot out there and gofight theenem y. T hey wer e looking to escapeand they 
would breakf ree. And again,m y m other's mem oirs,they brokef ree and they ran toward thef orest.  

Some of them were shot and some of them escaped.  Andthat's how the partisans gotf orm ed in the

they weren't, som e were trainedm ilitary, the comm andwas

>>Bill Benson: Rae, it's so diff icult to im agine what lif e was like for your mother and a young child, 
you, being part of a partisan group hiding in the woods, in thef orest in very dif f icult prim itive 

conditions andhunted continuously by Germ ans. W hat was that lifelike?
 

>>Rae Goldf arb:W hat was that like?  You never slept a decent night. W hen the group would go o

what they did was, you know, railr oadtracks and the

the woods

what do you call them ?

--
 
>>Rae Goldf arb:T he rails, they would loosen the rails so when a heavy train would go thro
u gh , it 
would derail. T hat would kind of  interf ere wit h the progress. Every so of ten sometim es there were 

people on the trains that that's the way they m oved their Arm y andsom etimes there was amm unition. 

But that'show they got their amm unition.T he group was supplying

basically they were the forward 
group. T hey were supplying the bigger groups that were further in thef orest with amm unition and

a lotof  the villagers around. T he villagers were af raid of the Nazis, too, because the Nazis started to 
takeaway their f arm  goods, their animals, ship them all tothef ront. They had tofeed their Arm y.  So 

the villagers that were at the

a t th e

sort of surrounding the forest because you can'tfarm  in the 
forest,especially when there werem arshes, so they were m ostly on theoutskirts. They didn't want 

their anim alsdestroyed.  They used to put their animals in theforest.  T he partisa
ns basically guarded 

them . Thepartisans didn't takem uchf rom  them , but they did take suppliesto eat.  But they started to 

share with the partisans becausethat was their only way of  keepingwhat they had.

the small group,eventually, 
however, you were captured by theGermans. T ell us whathappened. 
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: I got

I got sick with typhus andthe partisans hadset up am akeshif t hospital 
deeper in theforest where they f elt like they were safer. T he Nazis did not venture there.  And Mother 

got m e intoa wagon and tookm eto that hospital. T here were no

at this point there were not really 
doctors in the hospital.  There were som e that had known som ething about how to
 
sew up wounds, 
how to extract bullets and sew up wounds. But there was one woman there that was f rom thenext 

town thathad relatives in our town and we knew her ver y well.  Shewas a midwif e in Europe. She 

had just gotten her credentials as a m idwif e but she knew how to threada needle and sew intof lesh.  

She was basically running thathospital.  As soonas I got there, sheshaved my head, m y tem perature 

was ver y high.  Anywa y, she got me through. She got me through typhusand at that point thef ront 

lines have shif tedalready.  T hat was 1943. And as you know, the Russianarmieshadf inally m ade a 

stand and startedtopush the Nazis back. They started

the Russians startedto drop supplies tothe 
partisansand in the wintertime som e small planes would landonafrozen lake to bring in suppliesand 

bring in personnel. Basically off icers.  You can't organize anArm y without off icers. T hey would

to take m

blockade started. T heNazis were pushed
 
--
 
the Germ an arm ies,the Nazis were the onesthat were 
thebad ones. The Germ an arm ies, what could they do? T hey were  starting t
o be pushed back, and 
they were retreating.  So the comm and was the partisans weref ighting f rom  theback,they were 
f ighting thef ront lines in thef ront and thepartisans in theback,and they sent in extra soldiers to try to 

f ight thepartisans and to basically m ove them out.  The partisansf ragm ented into groupsbecause the 

sm aller the group, the easier to get away.
 
W e were stuck, not with our group, and we were caught by theGerm ans. W e were brought, of all 

places, the f orests wer e close to our hometo
wn.  Beyond it were som ebig forests,beyond our town, 
and we were brought to a barn with som eof  the villagers.  Mother was af raid to show herface. She 

wore a kerchief  that was tied like this.  And she pretended to be sick.  And I was the one that went 
out 
to procure som ething to eat. 
 
>>Bill Benson:So the Germ ans thought youwere a vil lager that they had

>>Rae Goldf arb:T hat's right.  W e were am ongst the villagers.
 
>>Bill Benson:They didn't think you were a partisan?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: No. I wouldn't

>>B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: But whathappened sim ply was that the villagers at thatpoint, they were just as 

scared as we were, and Mother was hiding and som e of the villager s did not really know her and she 

had changed trem endously.  She was a pretty stout wom an, and she became likea skeleton.  Her 

features hadn't changed but when you hide alot of them ,and she spoke only Polish, so she ref erred

they started to

girl or a boy.  I knew what itm eant.  So thenext thing I saidm echen (phonetic). But I'm Jewish, I sa

no.
 
>>Bill Benson: You said I'm am ale but they said you're Jewish.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Yeah.  W heredo I know the words? 
 

>>Bill Benson: How do you know the Germ an words?
 

>>Rae Goldf arb: None of them  knew.  Noneof  the villagers knew any Germ an.
 
>>B ill B e n

>>Rae Goldf arb: So who were you with?  My m other, started to cry Mom my.  My m other had been

>>Bill Benson:So your mother is im provising this on spot.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Shewas always thinking ahead.  Always thinking ahead.  Andthey letusgo.  And 

eventually the villagers were returnedto the villages because thepartisans disbursed and they were 

not in the area.  However, even in the villages, Motherhad to hide. It was in the spring of 1940

we're getting close to being the end.

>>Bill Benson: Yourmother would then takeyou right back out to rejoin the partisans.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Yes.
 
>>Bill Benson:So tell us about that andthentell us about your liberation.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: Okay.  Mother started tof ind out through talking to people where there was som e 

partisans.  Eventually we joined up with a group andthat group joined up with another group and we 

som ehow m et up with the Russian Arm y andwe were liberated.

did the Russian

a  ve r y

were som e Jews that were liberatedand they were ga thering at 
Lublin.  And we basically

she managed to get our boxcar attached.  There was another Jewish 
f a m ily 
with us, boxcar attached to a train thatwas heading toLublin. Andthat's how we got 
docum ents.
 
>>Bill Benson:The Red Cross documents?
 
>>Rae Goldf arb:T heRed Cross docum ented that I was born inLublin.  Didn't want to goback 

anywhere else.  She was very, ver y inventi ve.  My m other, I wasf ortunate to have her to the age of 

99.  However, all I can say is that once she got tobasically Italy shewas spent. She lost

she 
seemedtohave lostacertain desire to pushon. She lived, however, to theage o
f  99, and I was 
fortunatetohave her.  I was able to go back to work because she tended to the children. Andher aim  

was to go to Israel, which she went and she recorded her experiences atthe large m useum  in Israel.  

I have a copy of  it and I've been reading through it.  Fortunately, I can read it. It's done in Jewish.  I 

can read itand understand it because otherwi se m y memories would have beenalmost nil. I cam eto 

the UnitedStates, theaim  was to integrate,to learnthe language. I was put in sch
ool.  W e cam e 

here just beforeThanksgiving, No vem ber 14th, 1947.  Right afterT hanksgiving I was put in a school 

wi t h

in an elem entary school.  I had no docum ents. I did have som e knowledge because in the 
displaced persons' cam p in Italy, the Jewish people have organized themselves where those that 

knew a little bitm ore taught those that

you know, the younger ones.  So I hadenough knowledge of  
geography, m ath, history, that I was ableto kind of progress a littlefaster.
 
>>Bill Benson:So Rae, when you got to theUnited States in1947,you were in f act 15, but everybody

even if I haddocum entation foundtobe valid docum entation, I was put 
in elem entary school and graduated by the end of the sem esterf rom  elementary school and sent to 
junior high.
 
(Laughter)
 
Very short

ver y short elementary school exposure.
 
>>Bill Benson:And a short m iddle school probably.
 
>>Rae Goldf arb: No,m iddle school wasn't short. It was just thatIwas fortunate enoughto make 

f riends who were older and were wi lling to coach. I rem em ber learning civics over the summ er.  

English was another thing.  I was fortunateenough the teachers wer e willing to put in extratim e. 

T here was a Mrs.
 
Stam osand atthat tim e it was not calledm iddleschool, it was called junior high, 
who had lost herhusband
 
and a son in the war and she used to com e in earlier and give m e 
instructions in sentence structure and grammar.  In New York I was fortunate enough again tohave 

teachers, oneof  them was actually taught electrocution and anotheronethat taught speech later on 

that was willin g to put in time and I was wi llin g to do it.
