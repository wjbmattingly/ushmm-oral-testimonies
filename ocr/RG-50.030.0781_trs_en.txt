Q: So you were born in western

A: Well, we could go back to Œ to 
Jarocin
 and to 
Pozna

 for holidays; at 
Christmas, and so on. So I didn™t Œ 
I did know, especially, my maternal 
grandmother. My maternal grandfather died
 during th e Œ a-after World War I, so Œ 
Q: You didn™t know know him. 
A: I didn™t know him at all. He died very young. 

Q: Did your mo ther have
 brothers and sisters? 
A: She had four sisters Œ 
sisters, and one brother. 
Q: And where was she in the fami ly order of the siblings? 

A: Hm, hm, hm, my. I am not so sure. 

Q: Okay . 
A: She probably
 was second. 
Q: Second oldest? 
A: Oldest, yes. 

Q: Okay. Your father, did he 
have brothers and sisters? 
A: Yes, he also had Œ he had one, two,
 three, four brothers, and two sisters. 
Q: These are rather
 large families. 
A: Yes, they Œ these are, yes. 
Q: Were they city people, town people?

A: They were Œ my grandfather, on my fath
er™s side had a Œ a dairy, so they were 
farm people, even. And my mother Œ th-the 
father originally was a Œ a nobleman, he 
had an  esta Œ they had an es
tate an d they raised horses. 
And af Œ when  the inflation 
in Œ started after the first world war, 
he was ta king some horses to sell in 
Germany
, 
and this is what I hear, I don™t know. An
d he had no money on th e way back home, 
and died. 
Q: I see. I see. So she had gr
own up on an estate, basically. 
A: Yes, but not for long, because the fa
ther died rather Œ 
th-they were very 
impoverished aft Œ very , very early  in everybody™s life, really Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ because of the first World War, and 
then what Œ the aftermath of the first 
World War. 
Q: What did your parents tell you about th
eir own childhoods and growing up? Did 
they tell you stories? 
A: Not really, no. 
Q: No? Neither mother nor father. 

A: Neither mother nor fathe
r. Probably there was no time 
for it, because the second 
World War started, yeah. 

Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?

A: No. 
Q: So you were 
an only child? 
A: I was the only ch ild, yeah. 
Q: You™re the only child. 
What about your father™s 
service during World War I? 
Did you know mu ch  about that? 
A: Well, th-this is a rather complex story,
 because since they were living under the 

German occupation, in a way 
it was Œ during the partition of 
Poland
, they were 
born in 19 hun Œ 1899 and 1
902. My father had to se
rve in the German army. 
Q: The Prussian army then. 

A: Yes. And he was sent to fight the f Œ in 
France
, and he was wounded in 
France
. 
By the way, when he went to 
Poland
, he stole from everybody th  Œ any 
photographs of when  he was young, so I ha ve Œ I don™t know some people that are 

in these photographs. But a
nyway, so he served in the 
German army, and then he 
served Œ he Œ not served, bu
t then the Œ in the western 
Poland
, in 
Pozna

, around 
Pozna

, his brother and he were in volved  in
 the uprising against the Germans, or 
the 
Pr-Prussia
. And so  he fought in that, and then of course, after the 
Po-Poland
 
became free, he was Œ he m Œ went to
 Œ I won™t say it™s equivalent to 
West Poin t
, 
but it was a little bit less than that. I Œ I 
Œ I would say a military junior college, I 
don™t know. But he then  finished  that, 
and became a professional officer in the

Polish army, and 
then when the 
Bo lshev i ks
 attacked 
Poland
, after the 1917 
revolution, he wen Œ he
 went to fight the 
Bolsheviks
, and he was wo unded ag ain. 
But these wounds were not exactly critical, a
nd so Œ so  then, he continued really to 
advance to the Œ the ra-rank of cap-capt
ain, and of course then there was Œ 
transferred Œ as I say, I think I was abou
t two, to eas Œ eastern Œ southeastern 
Poland
. 
Q: What were Œ what was your father™s name? 
A:

A:

Q:

Poland
 were you Œ was he 
transferred to? 
A: He first was transferred to a town called 
Czarków
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I don™t remember much from there, 
except that we lived
 Œ I remember little 
pieces. We lived in a quarters for officers
, and it really surprised me not long ago, 

because there was a childless couple there, he was colonel. Colonel

Czeporowski

in the mo rning I would go Œ and he was a

Wikipedia

Q: Oh, he Œ he was murdered.

Katy n

Q: So Œ okay, so you rememb er that Œ 
A: I remember the name, yeah, and I 
rememb er that Œ you know. And also 
remember, since it was within 
the kor Œ or any military ki 
Œ compound, that I very Œ 
and my father had a Œ I think it™s called a soldier that was 
ordynan
 soldiers? I™m 
not sure how to Œ he was Œ he really
 was like an assistant to my father. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And he w Œ he ca Œ he was from 
Silesia
 
[indecipherable]
 and he Œ I remember 
that when  he was Œ once, 
at Easter, I imagine, to 
Silesia
, to his family, he brought 
great, great sort of cakes, he made into 
bunnies, you know. Because the pa Œ family 
was apparently in ba-baking, you know. 

Q: So, in  other word s, he would bring those back for you? 
A: Yes, he brought them back for me. 
Q: Well, children know what™s important.

Q: Bunny cakes are important. 

A: Right. 
Q: And so, did you Œ 
you said your father at fi

A: 
Czarków

Q: 
Czarków

A: Yeah. 

Q: And Œ and how long did you

Czarków
 then? 
[indecipherable]
 memo ries.  
A: Well that™s 
[indecipherable]
 yes, that™s v ery sketchy, yes. 

Q: And then  where was he transferred to? 
A: And then from 
Czarków
, he was transferr ed to 
Za l e s z c z y k i
, which is a town Œ 
now it™s called 
Za lishchyky
 because it™s 
Ukraine
. But the name is
 almost si mi lar, 
to Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ the one that existed. Th-This was a Œ 
really a resort town 
at one time, because 
it was southeastern 
Poland
 on the border betw een 
Ro ma nia  
and 
Poland
, and there 
were beaches there, you know, along th at 
Dniester river
. So Œ

A: Yes. So he Œ he Œ I don™t know the year
s in which he was transferred. I think he 
probably has it written somewh
ere because he Œ when we cam
e to this country, as I 
say, he started collecting in formati
on and photographs wh en he went to 
Poland
. But 
anyway, so that was maybe Œ 
maybe a Œ when I was four. 
Q: Okay .

Q: Okay . And was this part Œ was

A: Well, the 
Za l e s z c z y k i
 were really on the river 
Dniest
, on the Polish side. On the 
other side of the 
Dniest
 was 
Romania
, and mountains of 
Ro ma nia
 were there. 
Q: Okay . 

A: This was like a plateau wher
e we were, not Œ not mountains. 
Q: Okay. Not mountains. Was it 
a pretty place? From what you Œ 
A: Very beautiful, yes, yeah. And very 
unusual, because, as I say, it was a 
southeastern part of 
Poland
 where even grapes that 
they had Œ grapes grew, 
peaches, apricots, and so on. Which is unusual because 
Poland 
is a rather Œ

Q: What kind of place 
did you live in there? 
A: We lived in a Œ the way I remember, a 
two story house. So it Œ the first a Œ we 
lived on the main floor, we had an  ap
artment. And this Œ on th e second floor, 
somebody else lived. 

Q: Was this army Œ army residences? 
A: No, it was not any mo re army  residence, it was just on Œ an  apartment. 
Q: And your parents rented it from somebody? 

A: Yes, there were Œ that part of 
Poland
 has a Œ a really  Œ a large Œ at thats time was 
called a mi nority, but a large population of
 Ukrainians. And this was a Ukrainian 
lady who built this house, but she herself lived
 in a Œ a really very poor little kind of 

a Œ a home, and so we Œ we rented it, or 
my parents rented it from her, and she very 
often then  would take me to Œ to a Russian
 Orthodox church, espe
cially at Easter, I 
remember that again, because there were 
birds in cages, and it was an elaborate 
production, with flowers and so on.  

Q: Did you Œ was it Œ did you like 
going there, was it exotic? Yes?

what™s interesting to look

she looked Œ lived in  almo st nothing, and th

there was an orchard, and there were aprico

you could just go and pick them up. 

Q: Oh, how lovely. 
A: And in front there was a road, and Œ bu
t it was all Œ the way I recall it, it was not 
Œ there were not many houses
 around us. Going down  to
wards the river, more and 
more houses were built like Œ were there. 

Q: So maybe you were on th
e outskirts of the town? 
A: Yeah Œ well, not outskirts, but I woul
d say outskirts of the area where perhaps 
people preferred to live, because it was near to the river, and there was a beautiful 

sight of the mountains on th e Romanian side.

I mean, if your father had been  stationed 
there, it mu st have been for a purpose.

A: Yes. He wen Œ definitely. You know, 
that was the beginning of everything in 
Poland
, because 
Poland 
lost Œ for a hundred years lost its independence and since 
it was partitioned, there were so many en
tirely different pa Œ even infrastructure 
systems in Œ in different Œ depending wh

A: My mo th er did not have to do an Œ al
most anything. In the 
house we had a maid, 
and we also have someone that ad Œ that 
brought from the farms, milk, eggs and so 
on. And she did not have to clean the hous

She was cleaning the house, and she was 
living with us, in a separate room. 

Q: Was she Polish? 
A: Yes, she was, yes. I Œ I have even a picture of her somewhere. My  father stole it

commotion because a black man

stations. So we were Œ we were taken t-to
 Œ for a ba Œ for a shower, or whatever it 

was, but it Œ to clean ourselves, and to be
 deloused. And in  order to be deloused , 

everything was taken from us 
and put into , I don™t know, 
hot ovens, or wh atever. So 
that no matter where Œ you had to give 
everything up, so whoever had anything 
made out of leather became nothing, be
cause it was shrunken, you know, almo st 

burned. I rememb er gloves like that.

rest went elsewhere, I am sure, you know, 
to other collective farms, and we were 
put on a carts driven then, because that™s

got to this collective farm. 
The Œ the village was called 
Peschanka

was a

 which was even higher than  a

 a Œ one item for another.

ol, but there was a fa
mily with us, who 
were again, teenagers, and they appealed

were teenagers. And 
all of a sudden it just Œ I don™t Œ one of them became sort of my  teacher, or 

whatever, and I sort of started writi

everything, and it was no lo nger a chore. All of sudden  I hated every Ru ssian, 
maybe. I was very mad at them, at what 
they were doing to us
. I don™t remember 
being very  frightened , but I wa
s always sort of angry.  
Q: Well, it™s Œ it™s a very natural response. 
Your mo th er Œ now, you said that when 
you had, even at that beginning of the de

A: Correct. She had that Œ 

Q: So what happened ? 
A: Well, she had the heart problem to be
gin with. So , it got progressively wo rse, 
because I™m sure she was ve
ry much upset, and so on. 
So, there were, of course, 
exiled Ru ssian docto rs in 
P e scha nka
 too, but they had nothin
g to give you to help 
you wh en  you were sick. Bu
t they were extremely go
od doctors. But they were 
exiled like we, because they were doctors, th
ey were enemies of the state again. So, 
they somehow wrote that my
 mother didn™t have to
 work, which was worse, 
because then we didn™t get that piece of bread, but the 
Zh aglietska
(ph) family 
shared with us, you know.

with Ru ssian wo rkers. And he Œ one tim
e obviously, without knowing how, th at 
everyone sp ied on ev eryone, said that 
Polish work ers had it mu
ch better than the 
Russian workers, and they 
Œ somebody in that factor

maybe very soon afte
r, again, soldiers 
came, surrounded us, and su rro Œ came in
to the Œ where we were staying, and 
shoved us again together, and took him to
 the gulag, you know. He was 19. So he 
ended Œ and the mo ther went crazy, you know

i-in the gulag itself, in the 
prison camps. Fortunately, he survived , but he had many 
stories to tell too, as I recall, after that
, because he met such 
strange and different 
people, and of course was awful, awfu

Q: Uh-huh. All because he had said Œ

A: Of course, yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So Œ but that was a pass, 
because then we would si Œ 
well, we would really steal 
from the pigs. Of course, if you were caught, 
that was gulag again, but fortunately Œ 

Q: How could you steal from a pig? 

A: Well, the pigs ate something which is called 
ma kukha y
(ph), and it was what the 
pigs were eating, and they 
ev en Œ even ha-had  some milk, wh ich we never saw. And 

that we didn™t steal, because you couldn™t take it with you. Bu t 
maku khay
(ph) is a 
sunflower from which the

Q: Is pressed.

hen winter came you really Œ I mean, our

 Œ the landlady and her husb
and were eating potatoes 
just covered with butter, I Œ I Œ I almost 
fainted right there. Food was always on 
one™s mind. But the Œ th e landlad y™s husband 
was a chef at some cadet school, so he 
would steal from them. This is how they ha
d lots of food, but they  don™t Œ didn™t 
share it with us. Instead again, we stole 
from them, because the landlady had in Œ in 
her Œ like basement, da Œ un-under Œ dungeo

toasted dark  bread. So we si Œ we would 
position guards to see if she was comi ng, 
and one would go 
down and steal.

 the rast Œ last group of the soldiers,

something called 
Krasnovodsk
, which was on th e cas Œ port on the

And on Œ with the last transport from

No shoes, so now the feet
