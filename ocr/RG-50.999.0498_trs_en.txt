T hank you som uch, Halina, for doing
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today.  It's always so nice totalk 
to you.  I learn som ething new ever y tim e we sit down.
 
 
You had mentioned that
 
--
 
f irst of all, letm e just say that you were born i
n Krakow 
but you lived in the town of Zaleszczyki.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Zaleszczyk i.
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder:  Zaleszc zyki.  Maybe by the time we're done I'll have it down.
  
Can you tell 
us,f irst of all, where was the town? W hat kind of a town was it? 
 

>> Ha lin a  
Peabody: The town was the easternm ost little town on thef ront of Romania.  Itwas 

a beautiful little town wherem y parents moved when they got m arried because myf ather was 

a beginning dentist and wantedto go ina small town to start anew surgery.  Kra
k ow wa s  

obviously f ull of dentists.

My m other was ver y happy to come to Zaleszc zyki because it wasfull of  water.  It 
was alm ost com pletely surroundedby the river.  And m y mother hadbeen a champion 
swim m er.  So she hadthe opportunity todo water
-
skiing, swim m ing, of  course. She just loved 
being onthe water.  So she was ver y happy about it.
 
 
My f ather, as I said, started the surgery.  Sowe li ved in Zaleszczyk i  with a house, 
half for the surgery and half where we li ved.
  
T wo m onths before the war
 
m y sister was born.
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder:  How did your parentsm eet?  Do you know?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,m y f ather was very interested inm y m other because she hadwon 

championshipof  Poland in swim m ing and she was ver y f amous. That's what she told me.
 
>

[Laughter]
 
>> Halina Peabody:  People were pointing ather in the streets.  She was very young, m aybe 

18. Sohe courted herand caughther.  He knew a good thing whenhe saw it.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder: T he town that you lived in, who were the p
eople that were your f riends and 
neighbors?W as it a predom inantly Jewish town, m ainly non
-
Jewish? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Zaleszczyk i was a small town.  It was abordertown.  They had the 

religious Jewish people living in one part of the town butm y father
 
belonged to the 
non
-
observant ones.T he professionals were not very observant in Krakow as well.  So we 
didn't speak Yiddish at hom e. My f ather was kind off riends with thedoctorsand other 

prof essionals inthe town.
 
 
Asf ar as I rem em ber,we had lots of f riends;ver y nice people. ButI was not quite7 
years old som y
 
m em or i e s
 
are very scant.  You know, child'sm em ories of those years. 
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder:  In 1939, Septem ber of 1939, Germ any invaded Poland.  Your town
 
--
 
do 
you rem em ber this?
 
>> Ha lin a  P
eabody: W hat happened in September
 
1939, Polandwas split into two.  Our part 
of  Poland
 
--
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder:  Right.  I'm  sorry.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's all right. It was invaded by the Russians. T hey split Poland.  

Germ ans took theupper part.T he R
ussians cam e to our part.  The m ain thing that they 
worr ied about was them en because them enwere af raidof being conscripted intothe Russian 

Arm y, which was theusual procedure what they did and they were basing themselves 
o n t he  

F i rs t  W orld  W ar.   S o  th
e men were mostly the ones in danger, they thought. T hey never 
thought that wom en and children were.  Sotheref orea lot of m en got together and just crossed 

the river.  There was anice littlebridge going to Romania.  And they just crossed over.  
 
 
M y f
ather was af raid to takeus because I had a baby sister.  So hewas worried 
about nothaving m ilk for her and conditionswould be hard. So they didn't think womenand 

children were in danger.  So we were left alone.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Do 
you 
r e m em be r  t h at  
time period? The Russians had taken over thispart 
of  Poland.  Do you remem ber?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  I rem ember that thepeople were ver y scared but we were m ostly in the 

house trying to look after thebaby.  That wasm y m em ory.  And I know everybody was 

w
hispering and beingquiet and scared.  Butthose arem y m em ories.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Soyou
r 
f atherdid go to Rom ania.  He returned?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. W hat happenedwas af ter afew weeks, things kindof  settled 

down.  The Russianstook everything they co
uld f ind.  T hey 
pilfered.  And people started 
thinking, you know, the ones that crossed decided that maybe they lef t the fam ilies and maybe 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

things are now quiet enough,m aybethey could cross back again. So afew of  them  got 
together and everything 
was f rozen solid by then and they tried to cross over on the river back 
to Poland.  Andby then apparently the Russians sealedthe border. They caught them  all. 

And whenthey caughtthem , they arrested them . T hey saidthey were spiesbecause they 

were going back andforth. They putthem  in prison.
  
In m y father's case, being a dentist, said 
he was a spy, put him on trial and gave him  20 years hard labor. They transported him  to 

Russia. W e lost him  com pletely by then.
  
 
 
W ehad alsohad tobe ready to be taken to Russia because asfam ily of  a spy, a 
crim inal, we had no right to be in thehouse. T heref ore, we were ready to go, packed, they 

were going to take us to Russia. 
 
 
Fortunately they did not take usbutthey threw us out of ourhouse. And we went up 
the road to a little town calledT luste. That was a little town that we spent the restof  the 

Russian occupation.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Until 1941?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  Until theGermans.  And then very quickl y theGer
mans decided 
they would takethe rest of Poland andthe Russians just disappeared. So we cam ebackto 

our houseand settledback into our house, awaiting the Germ an occupiers.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W hen you say your fam ily, you, your sister, your m other returned back to 
your town, returned back to your house waiting f or the Nazi occupation, essentially
.  W
hat did 
you anticipate
 
--
 
whatdid your m otheranticipate?  Do you know? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e were just worried because we didn't know what to expect.  No
body 
knew. W eall wanted to cooperate.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did you weigh which was better, Russian vers
us
 
your
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e had no choice.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Right.  You saidearlier there was a chance youm ight be deported also to 
Ru s s ia .
 
>> 
Halina Peabody:  Yes.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You saidfortunately or unfortunately you didn't get deported. Knowing the 
historical backgroundof what happened to those Jews, do you think the choice would have 

been better to be deported?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  T hey did survive.  Ever ybody did survive, yes.  My aunt was taken, 

m y uncle,m y cousinand they did survive.  It was ver y hard.  Som eof  them were ver y hard 

conditions.  My father was in the
 
--
 
he apparently had a little bitof  conditions because he was
 
theonly m edical person there sohe was made am edical off icer of the camp.  Hehad 

apparently notas bada situation
 
af
ter thef irst year.  First year he never talked about.  
Apparently it was terrible.  Idon't know what they d
id
 
to him, he never talked
 
about it. But 
af terwards it was not so terrible. And justbefore the Germ ans cam e we m anaged to havea 

few letters backandf orth.  So we knew
 
--
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You had som e sign
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  He was therefor 20 years. T hat's all we 
knew.  And then, of  

course, whenthe Germ ans cam e, we lost com plete contact with him .
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You knew he was sentenced to 20 years.  Youhada coupleof  letters.  I'm  
sure the letters were censored, right?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Of  course.
 
>> 
Susan
 
Snyder:  Sothe information was ve ry vague.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  It was vague.

>> 
Susan Snyder: W hat about otherfam ily in thearea?  Did youhave f am ily that came to 
where you were?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No.  W ehad nof am ily.  My t wo aunts that came
 
when the Russianswere 
com ing in1939,one aunt was taken to Russia and theotheraunt stayed because she was 

sick andthey lef ther. She then perishedaf ter wards in a camp. Butwe never saw her agai n.  

T hat was the auntactually that was in thepicture, AuntIrka. So we lost touch.  But we had 

goodf riends. There was a very nice little com munity.  And they took care of us.T hey really 

helped us.  Becausemy m other was with the two of us. W ehad no visible m eans of  support 

either. Sothey were very,
 
very good to us, our f riends. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W hat was Nazi occupation like?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,f irst of all, therewas various comm ands.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: T hings changed imm ediately with laws against the Jews.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Exactl y.  First of all, there was no schoolfor Jewish children.  You 

couldn't
 
--
 
they couldn't come out at night.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  A curfew?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  A curf ew.  And every Jewish person had to beworkin g f or theGermans.  

In the case of m y mother
 
--
 
they knew ever ything about everybody.  T hey had lists. So they 
knew m y m other was a wonderful knitter andalso did wonderf ul embroidery.  So she was 

m ade the chief  knitterfor themayor of the town, the Germ anm ayor of  the town, who had lots 

of  children.
  
My m other was knitting for his children
 
an
d looking af terus. 
 
 
Ever ybody was ver y c ooperative. T hey triedto be as good
 
--
 
we didn't know what to 
expect, obviously.
  
If  t
here were no particular jobsfor Jewish people,then they had them  
cleaning the sidewalks.  It was that strict. And they would take groups of people to various 

jobs. T hey had lots of fields there. There were various jobs to do.  So they would take a group 

of  young people in the m orning and they would com ebackat night. T hey said e
verybody was 

ver y cooperative. W e just did not know what to expectbut wef elt if we cooperated that things 

would be, you know, ok. 
 

>> 
Susan Snyder:  And what about you?  It's hard to go back and rem ember obviously 70 
years ago butdid youfeel overwhelm ingly that the best thing to do was tohelp your m other, to 

not create waves, tobe sort of robbed 
of  
your childhood essentially?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  My m other was very good at keeping up m y skills because m y 

father had taughtm eto read beforethe war. My m other keptupm y reading skills.  My m other 

was a wonderful person, as all mothers are.Butm y m other was ver y strict but very good,you 

know.  So whatever she told me I woulddo with no problem s.  I don't think I gave her any 

problem s. W e lookedaf ter thebaby. T he baby was nothealthy. W e had lots of problem s 

there. She hadproblem s with feeding her. So it was hard. But asIsaid, our f riends helped 

us.  And everybody wa s, as I said, hoping f or the best.
 
 
In them eantim e, we had to, of course, give up everything.  I didn'tm ention we 
had
 
--
 
conf iscatedanything.  They alsoputthe Jewish star on the hom es.  And we had the 
Je wish   
arm  guards towear.  Being so young, stayed home with her.  She would go out and 
knit and bring the stuff back andforth. T hings were m ore or less calm .
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  More or less calm  under Nazi occupation.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W hat was thef irst indication that really som ething was wrong, that you 
were in trouble?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, what happened
 
--

>> 
Susan Snyder:  In the Jewish com munity, I should say.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W hat happened was they also created a Jewish com m ittee of the Jewish 
leaders in the town.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: T he Nazis appointed people to do the work.
 
>> H a
lina Peabody: W hatever they needed they would dem and through the com m ittee.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Jewish com m unity.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  And after they were taking the groups in and outandeverybody 

was working and, as Isaid, quietly
,  
trying to be com pliant, they askedf or a larger group; they 
s a id
 
to congregate in them ain square and that they would go out
 
--
 
a little bit out of town there 
was a old Polish Arm y cam p.  
 
 
T he weather in Zaleszczyki, we hadfour different separate seasons.  The winter wa
s 
ver y, very harsh.  Everything was f rozen solid.  Just like in the summer you could grow 

apricots, cherries in the garden.  So there were really two diff erent distinct seasons, yes.  

Because it was wintertim e and soharsh, we used to put double windows, som ething in 

between. It was really, really cold weather there.
 
 
So thisbig group was requested to com e intothe square and they wouldbe taken 
out into this cam pbecausethere were lots of young trees and they wanted to bind the trunks 

of  t he  t r ee s  fo r  t
he winter.  You know, you putburlaparound the trunks so that thetrees don't 
die.  Andthat was the reason thata lotof people cam eand even som e volunteered. And they 

were m arched up the road.  And we waitedf or them  to com eback,as usual. T he whole
 
d a y 
went by. W e waited, waited
; 
evening cam eand nobody came back.  People got very anxious 
andnervous anddidn't know what to think. They just weren't com ing back.
 
 
Finally, towards the evening onem an cam eback.  Hehad been wounded.  He was 
shot in the arm .  Andhe told the story what happened. W hen they cam e up tothe cam p, they 

found an open grave with planks over it. T hey were told toundressand lay on the planksand 

they were shot oneby one.  And as they were  shot, they dropped in. Andthis man who 

survi ved was one of the lastones tobe shot. They m issed his heart.  He was able todig 

him self out.  Becausewhen they lef t,they didn't even cover them very m uch.  Hem anaged to 

com e back and he told us the story.
 
 
So thenthe whole comm unity understoodthat things were ver y, ver y bad.  
Ever ybody started looking f orhiding places because we gathered that we were going to have 

to be on the run. 
 
600people were killed.  So you can im agine the situation inthe town.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  And people you knew becausethe town was small?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, yes, of  course.  I was ver y young butI stillknow a lot of people that 

lost their lives there. 
 
 
So we just
 
--
 
then, youknow, we waited to see what the next step isgoing to be 
knowing that things are not going to be great.
  
T he next thing that cam e was a dem andfor 
people to go to work in Germany. T hat was 
a 
ver y com mon thing because they needed 
people to work in Germ any.  A lotof  peopledid go. T he non
-
Jews went wi llingl y becausethey 
needed 
the work and they were not being kill ed. But the Jewish peoplenever offered to go to 
Germ any for work.  T his was a dem and. Andthey were not going tobe paid oranything like 

th a t.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Slave labor, f orced labor.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right. T hey dem anded a setnum berof people to be in the square.  

T hey were going to go to Germany f or work. People obviously went.  They m anaged to get the 

right number of people.  T hen they putthem all on thetrain. And, again, you kno
w 
--
 
we hid 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

wi t
h the cook. W eused to have a cook. T hewhole day we spent wi th the cook
 i
n  Za le szczyki.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Sotemporarily until you could
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Until they would start looking. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  But your m other knew she needed to do som e
th in g.   Righ t ?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, yes.  But there was not muchtodo.W e had nowhere to go. T here 

was nowhere to go. This was a hiding placefor one day.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Right.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Also, the Germ ans didn't want thetrouble.  It wasn't such a big Jewis h 

comm unity so they didn't want tohave the trouble to try andf indus,you know, next tim e. So 

what they did is they threw all of  us, whatever rem ained, intothe town, the next town, called 

T luste. And what they did, which we realized when we got there, was that they had 

people
 
--
 
they didthe sam e thing in all the com munities aroundthere. W ith the remains of the 
people they didn'tm anage to kill they put intoT luste. So itbecame a ghetto later.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  A larger town?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  A little larger.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: T hey gathered the sm aller towns andm oved them .
 
>> Halina Peabody: W hatever rem ained of the Jewish com munities around that areathey put 

there.W e couldn't know what was happening. T here were no radios, nonewspapers.  Sowe 

didn't know.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  And you weren't allowed to have them  anyway. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, we were not. But we didn't know.  So we realized we were now in the 

sam e town as we were during the Russian occupation. That was the only thing. W ehad 

som e contactsthere. So we were put into acomm on kindof housing.  And, again, thef irst 

thing they started doing was looking for
 
hiding places because we knew what was awaiting us 
m ore or less.
  
My m other said tom e
:  T
h is  is
 
not going to help because you know what they're 
going to do, they're going to move us again.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: T hinking one step ahead.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right.  But, again,therewas nothing tobedone.  She would very m uch 

have liked to have the children, m y sister and m e, to take to Romania, but
 
--
 
there were som e 
ships going apparently but nothing ever came of  it.
 
 
So again, we were wai ting for the next whatever shoe tofall. And itcam e down.  
T hey demandeda setnumber of  people again. T hey said would work in Germany.
  
S o 
ever ybody had their own hiding places.  My m other did not want tohide in the sam ehouse.  

Shehad these contacts.  So she decidedto split us up. W ehad two farmers which she knew 

f rom  theprevious trip. Sheputme up in the lof t inone of thef arm ers and she, herself , went to 

another farm er
 
--
 
excuse me.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  She separated you.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She separatedus. Shewent with the otherf arm er with m y baby sister.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W ith Eva.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W ere you afraidtobe separated? W hat happened when she said thatshe 
was going do this? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Idon't know.  I knew the lady. W hatever m y mother, you know
 
--
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W hat she said, you did.
 
>> Ha lin
a Peabody:  Itrustedher. Butall day I was worr ied ver y m uch because I thought that 
she was caught.

>> 
Susan Snyder:  You had no idea.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Ihadno idea. T hey wer e collecting people and dragging them  out. Iwas 
thinking m y m other was caught because the lady who had m e kept telling m e, you know, she 

saw this onethere and these people I knew f rom our house.  So I knew.  So I was petrif iedthat 

she was caught.  I waited allday.  Towards the evening shedid come and get me. W hen she 

s a w 
m e, she toldm e whathappenedtoher. She said thatthe wom an who kept her got scared 
in the m iddleof  theday and threw her out
 i
nto an em ptyf ield. And the f ield was apparently 
com pletely f lat. It had one little bush. She crouched by that bush withmy sister for the rest of 

theday.  She said thatthere were airplanesf lying around lookingf or stragglers.  T hey were 

lookingf or stragglers.  It was som e m iracle that she did not get caught.
 
 
T hen she toldm ehow she thought I was caught.  So shethought
 
Iwas caught.  So 
we both hadthisf eeling that theother one was caught. And she said, 
ﬁL
ook, the way things 
are, we're not going to split upagain. W hatever happens 
t o 
us we wi ll go and do together.
ﬂ
  
Yeah.  So she's not going to do thisagain.
 
 
And she,again,as I said, there was notm uch we could do because there were no 
doors open to us,nowhere to run.  But intheend, the bottom  line was that they came upwith 

this idea thatbecause we were threefemales that perhaps we didn't look very Je wish, w
e 
didn't speak Jewish
 
--
 m
y m other's Polish was ver y good.  She went to a Polish school.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You said 
ﬁ
they
ﬂ 
cam e upwith this idea.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  A friend. Friends.  My m other'sf riends.
  
So they went to a priest and 
purchased papers 
in different names.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W ith what?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Idon't know.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did you assum e yourm other
 
--
 
>> Halina Peabody:  I know they paid. I don't know.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  So she boughtfalse IDs.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's co
rre c t.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: T ell us about going to Jaroslaw.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. W ell, when we got thepapers, we m anaged to get out of  this area.  

I don't know if  it was closedthere or not yet but we m anagedto getout.T hey put uson the 

train.
 
 
Now, m y m otherdecided to go to aplace, sort of on the way to Krakow. W hether 
they had any signif icance or not I don't know.  Obviously by then I was herpartner because we 

were the only two.  She satme down. She gave m eall the details,a new name, a new birth 

date, new grandparents, new birthplace, everything.  So I hadto learn that.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You say this
 
--
 w
henever I read youroral history or anything, you describe 
it as apartnership. You f eel like at this pointyour m other needed you as
 
an equal as opposed 
to being her child because you were oldenough.
 
>> Halina Peabody: That's right. T hat's right.  I was oldenough.  Yes.  And, you know,f ear of  

death will m ake you grow up ver y f ast.  So, yeah,f rom  thenon wewere partners.
 
 
Of co u r
se, the baby, my sister was too young, too, so we didn't tellher anything.  I 
did not know m uchabout the Catholic religio n.  Ididn't really have any idea except that I think I 

was told that Ihave to cross m yself with m y ri ght hand going in andoutof  t
he church.  T hat's 
about theamount of inform ation I had. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  But you had a close call on the way.  Right?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, yes. W ell, I'm  not there yet.

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah. T he train journey was going to takefour days andf our nights.  You 
can imagine how thatwas with the threeof  us. W e had to change trains in between. It was 

not today's trains.  It was the old
-
fashioned.
 
 
As we startedour trip,a young m an attachedhim self tous and started chatting
 
my
 
mo
ther up andasking about the children. Slowl y, slo wl y.  In theend he started pushing us, 
asking if there was som e Jewish person in ourf am ily.  Because asfar as Hitler was 

concerned, it was enough tohave great, great, greatancestry thatwere Jewish.  
It wa s 

enough.  Andm y m other finally said tom e
:  Y
ou know, I couldn't withstand thepressure
; 
I told 
him , yes, that, infact,we are Jewish. W hichat thispoint he said
:  W
ell in that case, youknow, 
I have to take you to the Gestapo but I'm  going to Jaroslaw as well so I'm going to accompany 

you and when we get to Jaroslaw, I'll take you over to the Gestapo.
 
 
So that'show we trave led for thefourdays andf our nights.  He made sure that one 
of  the kids was in his sight.  He looked af ter us.  Andm y m other, asusual, was thinking wh at 

could 
she do.
  
 
 
T here was nowhere torun.  I certainly wouldn't have gone without her.
  
So she 
f inally started talking to him and asking him f or what he thought would be the only kind of  way 

outfor us.  She said she was going to gi ve him  the ticketf or what we had left, two suitcases 

was all we had left of our belongings and a little m oney shehad andthe coats we had on our 

back but 
he had to 
prom ise her one thing
: w
hen we get tothe Gestapo
 
thatthey was going to 
have us
 
shot,all threeof  usatone time.  Quickly.  Because shedidnot
 
--
 
she realized what 
terrible things awaited us if  we got split up. They didn't keep children.  Shem ight have 

survi ved as a slave laborer but she didnot want to survi ve.  She justwanted
 
to save the 
children. And there was no way that she could do it so shefelt it was better to shoot us quickly 

so we would not sufferwhatever tortures were awaiting us. 
  
So he prom ised.  He saidhe 

would.  And that's how we traveled.
 
 
W e were exhausted.
  
Can you imaginef ourdays andfournights on the train, two 
kid s.  

>> 
Susan Snyder:  Knowing that you were going to be handedover to the Gestapo.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, thatthought, youknow, that's what I was just coming to. W ewere 

so tired.W e were notthinking. W e were just traveling.  Going.  Going.  And thenaf terfour 

days we arri ved in Jaroslaw.  As we were get ting off  the train, suddenly I woke up and I said, 

ohm y God, you know, we're now going to get shot.  So I started pulling at my mother and 

saying, 
ﬁM
om , m om , I don't want to die.
ﬂ
  
My poorm om , you know, 
she looked at him  and she 
s a id
,  lo
ok,m aybe youcan let her go
; 
she's blond and green
-
eyed,m aybe she can survive .  
And I said, 
ﬁN
o, no, I don't want to go by myself.
ﬂ 
 
So as we were walking towards theGestapo,m y m other still thinking.  Finally she 
said, look, Ihave given you everything I have
; j
ust keep it. W hy don't you just let us go
a
n d  t r y 
our luck
?
  
You know, you said you had children of your own. W hy do you want tohave this on 
your conscience?  Just let us goand we'll tr y our luck. And som ething touchedhim .  He let u
s 

go.  His parting words were " You don't havea chance
,
"  buthe left us.  And that was one of the 
otherm iracles that happened. 
 
 
So there we were in this strange town, in them ain road, and we wer e walking.  
W here were we going?   My m other saw a little caf e.  So we walked in.  Askedfor a littlem ilk 

for m y sister.  Started looking around.  First of all, we didn't know if  the papers were realor not.  

Could have gi ven us anything.  I gave them  to the Museum, as youknow.  I don't know if  it was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

good or not. And those days there were no com puters. W e couldn't really check.  So we just 
worr ied that we wouldn't want to be caught and askfor papers which we had but we didn't 

want that.
 
 
Som y m other realized that we need
ed
 
tof ind a place to stay.  So she started asking 
if  there was anybody who takes lodge
r
s in.  Ayoung m an got up and said, yes, you know, 
there'sa washer lady, ver y nice, she takes inlodgers.  He said
, ﬁ
I'll take you over there.
ﬂ
  
So  
he walked usover to this nice lady.  She was a tiny little lady.  She saw the mother and two 

children
 c
om pletely bedraggled, four days andf our nights,full of  lif e.  God, Idon't know.
 
Anyway so she said she would
 
take us.  Her son,absolutely not," don't take her."  But, you 
know, she was a very good Christian.  She said: L
o o k, th
is isam other and two children;
 
I 
have to takeher. Soanother one of thosem iracles. 
  
So she gave us a bed.That's all we 

needed. 
 
It was wartim e.  It was a small town.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Everybody was suffering.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Exactl y.  So we got thisonebed. W edidn't need anymore.  It was 

wa r m e
r that way anyway.  Poland is
 
very col d in the winter.  Som y m other told her, 
ﬁL
o
o k , I  
had no m oney
ﬂ 
--
 
because she gave him everything 
Œ 
ﬁb
ut the next day, tom orrow, I'll go and 
get a job and whatever I earn, I'll bring to youfor having us.
ﬂ
  
 
 
And shedid that.  Shegot a f ew jobs. She was very wor ried aboutm y sister who 
wa s  ve r y 
sickl y. W e never knew exactl y what was wrong with her.  I think she was very weak.  
Shehadf ull of boils on her body
.  T
hat, as I said, was really hard on m y m other because she 
usedto tell me that she used to com eatnight and wouldn't 
be 
sureif  she would find her alive.  
It was thatbad.  I didn't realize how bad it was.  
 
 
But I was strong.  I was the one that was out.  And she always sends m eout 
because shefelt that
 
--
 
m y hair with thebraids.  My sister's hair was  ver y 
c
u rl y
.  And that was a 
bad t
hing.  Because Polish girls have straight, blond hair.  And Jewish girls have got 
c u rl
y hair.  
And this was always a sign.  So the thing is, she was always af raid that somebody would point.  

And it was enough. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Soshe would go out doing odd jobs during the day.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She worked as sort of ahousekeeper wherever she could f ind.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  She managed to make itwork.
 
>>
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes, she did. T hey looked afterm y sister.  Asa Polish child, I was 
allowed to go to school for two hoursa 
da
y.  That was very good becauseone was for general 
s
tudiesbut one was for religion.  Andthat was a very nice priest.  Iwas able to catcha little bit 

of  inform ationabouthow to behave in church. 
 

>> 
Susan Snyder:  You were Catholic.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely. 
 

>> 
Susan Snyder:  Aged 10 or 11?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  I knew I was Jewis h.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did you end up
 
observing H
o l y 
C
om m union?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I did whatever was requested. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  How did you f eel about that?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,m y m other said that we all pray to the sam e God but through 

different religions
 a
nd that we happen to be Jewish.  T hat's all. And it never botheredm e. I 
never hadany conf lictabout it.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  I think online we have some pictures of  you in our photoarchives of  
wearing your

>> Halina Peabody:  Comm union. Yes. T hat's right.  I did go.  Yes, I did go. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You should check itout.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  It's a very beautif ul religion. It's very easy to become. But if  you're 
already something else, you know, you can't.  Plus thefact isthat I realize that
 
they wanted to 
kill m e because I'm  Jewish.  And Ifelt that was very unjust.  Ifelt that it was just not right. So I 

was ver y angr y about that.  So I did what I had todo.  Ihad som ef riends.  W e did the bestwe 

could.
 
 
Actually, the church was wonderful to com e in on Sunday.  I remember the incense
.  
T
he priest was lovel y.  The Germ ans did not com e to church.  On Sundays when we went to 
church, it was really a ver y relaxing tim e. W e didn'thave enough clothes. W ehad the clogs.  

W ehad to wear newspapers around ourf eet. It wasn't an easy life but the church,Sunday 

church, was very nice.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W hat was the woman who you were hiding with like? W hat was she like?  
Anddo you think she suspectedthat you were Jews?
 

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, Ihave beenthinking about it. I didn't think soat the tim ebut Ido 

know that shef igured thatm y m other was too old to deal with, m y sister was too young.  Iwas 

theone she was worki ng on. She wantedtosave m y soul.  AndI gave her credit.  She wa
s a  

lovel y lady.  She was a real person. She was a washerwom an. Shehada big accident.  Her 

left hand, she had nofingers.  She had someaccident.  AndI always  felt there was som e 

connectionbetween us on that scoreas I'll tell you later.
  
But her son
s, strapping four boys, 
m en. W e were always  af raid of  them  because we didn't know.  They weren't toohappy having 

u s.  

>> 
Susan Snyder: T hey weren't happy notnecessarily because they knew you were Jews  but 
because it was additional people totake care of
? 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, Idon't
 
--
 
I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  But they endedupaccepting us.  
It was af ull house.  It was a little house,as you saw that.  It was a little house.  Everybody got
 
a bed. There was quite a few people.  It was a little house divided into three parts. W e were in 

the m iddle part.
 
 
My m other, as usual,was tr ying to f ind a safer wa y.  First of all, she took all the hair 
off m y sister.  She shaved her head completely.  Because she said it was to make it thicker.  

T hat was herexcuse. She was always looking f or a safer job,f or a little better condition. So 

she was always thinking forward.
 
 
During that tim e we were there we hadone letterf rom the people we left behind who 
did not survive but som ehow m anaged to wr ite us this letter.  Andthat letter really ga ve us the 

possibility of afuture because what it said was that m yf ather had sent a letterthroughtheRed 

Cross to say that he was safe with his sister in Palestine.  Now, that's a bitof history that is 

different because Palestine was, atthat time,under the Britishm andateas was the whole 

Middle East. W e knew that there was one sister of m y father's thatwent out to Palestine to 

work on the landbefore 1932. W e never m et her. W enever knew thatpart of thefam ily
.  B u t 
we were aware of thefact there was som ebody there. So we understood that he was outof  

Ru s s ia .  
 
 
Now, the way he got out of Russia was because Stalin wanted to cooperate with 
Roosevelt and Churchill by sending some people to the Arm y,f orthe boots on the ground 

because they were losing to Hitler.  So they needed people tof ight. So he agreed to let som e 

political prisoners out. They asked General Anders, who was one of thepolitical prisoners,to 

createa Polish unit.  That's the way thatm y father came outof  Russia legally, m ore or less.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
Andhe was part of the British Arm y.
  
Inf act,what he was, he was part of the unitthat was in 
Egypt, stationed inEgypt. Butat that point we just knew that he was f ree.  He was outof  
Ru s s ia
, w
hich was im portant.  Because we could not do anything about it.  It was just 
som ething that gave us a littlebit of hope. 
 
 
Andm y m other,as I said, she tried tooffer us to go to work in Germ any because 
shefelt asa Polish person
 
--
 
asa Polish person because she thought that that would be saf er 
because we knew thatthe Polish people could tell Jewish peoplemuch quicker thanthe 

Germ ans. She thought it m ightbe saf er. But they didn't take usbecausem y sister was too 

young.  So thatdidn't work out.
 
 
T he next thing shedecided that she would like to workf or som ething like a German 
m ilitary cam p. She appliedfor a job there because shefelt if  she was working f or the 

Germ ans, she would have an ID showing that she was working f or the Germ ans.  And the 

Germ ans, whenever they stopped you in thestreet or raided your hom e, thef irst thing they 

wanted to know is that you're workin g
;  yo
u're workin g f or them . Everybody had tobe working 
for them .  T he Pols as well.
 
 
Som y m otherf inally decided totake the chance andapply to theGerm an military 
cam p, to work there. It was a little dangerousbecause they said they have to check your 

papers.  And we lived in fear again not knowing what's going to happen.  But in theend she did 

m a na ge  t o ge t  t he  job .
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Not only hiding in plain sight but working f or theenem y.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Right.  The job was work ing in the kitchen, peeling potatoesf or the 

Germ an troops. But
 
--
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did this enable herto learn any kindof  information on what was going
 
on 
with the Nazis or thefront?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Nothing at all. W edid not know anything.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  It was sim ply anextra m easure of protection.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.  And it didhelp.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did shedo this through the end of the war?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes. This was towards the end.
  
W hat happened was they did raid our 
house. T hey cam e in the m iddle of the night,scream ing and yelling.  It was always ver y
 
--
 
they 
alwa ys wanted to scare you.  In them iddle of night, always. 
 
Ever yb ody out.  So everybody 
obviously got out.  And m y m other just handed him the ID andhe says, 
ﬁO
h, no, you stay.
ﬂ
  
So  
all thepeople that were there, theonly Jews stayed. T hey took therest out and they took 

them  into the Gestapostation and they checked them  out. They wer e all ok.  So they cam e 

back thenext m orning.  But f or us it was justver y f rightening and any little thing like that 

helped. So we were saved again.
 
 
As I said, we did not know what was happening in thef ront. W edidn't know w
ho 
was doing what. W e sim ply went day by day.  As I said,m y sister wa s so sick.  My m other 

was al ways wor ried.  I continued going to school.  I also workeda little bit. Theneighbor, who 

was partially Germ an, my m otherf elt them ore everybody works, th
e  b ette r. 
 
 
And then onem orning when we woke up, it was com plete silence on the street. W e 
were on the main roadand there was no clatter of  horses. Usually there were horse and carts 

going. W e just didn't know what was happening. W edidn't know, as I
 
said, what was going on 
on the f ront.
 
 
Som y m other was lyin g in bed with m y sister.  I was standing by thewindo w.  As we 
were talking, suddenly there was a tremendous bang. Everything we nt black.  And I started

scream ing
, " M
y hand,m y hand."  Andm y m other grabbedm y sister, grabbedm e by thehand, 
and we walked into the street.  My hand wasbleeding.  My m otherwas look
in g
 
around to see if  
there was anything tohelp with me becauseshe was carrying m y si ster. There was nobody.  
So we walked up to the hospital, which was near. They pickedmeup and cleanedm e up.  

T hey scaredm y m other ver y badly becausethey said it was a lotof dirt and my hand 

wa s
 
--
 
you know, it wa s open wound.  So they said thatthey m ighthave toamputate my hand.  
Of co u rse, tha
t was m y m other, you know, you can im agine what m y m other's thinking.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You just survi ved all of  this tim e.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She thought, yes.  Atany rate, she stayed over that night. They said that 

the Germanshadapparently just disappeared and the Russians were com ing in.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Sothebom bing was justf ighting between the Germ ansand the Russians?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Probably.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Itessentially ended theoccupation. The Nazis.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yes.
 
>> 
S
usan Snyder: W hat happened
 
--
 
how did you regroup after thewar?  First of all, 
d id
 
--
 
when you saw that the Germ ans were no longer occupying the town, did you then adm it 
to the wom an that youwere Jewish? 
 

>> Halina Peabody: The wom an got killed.
 
>> 
Su s
an Snyder:  She was killed?
 
>> Halina Peabody: W e did not know.  My m other went back with m y sister.  Shefound out 

that she was in the kitchen and the rooff ellover her and she was killed. There was no
 
--
 
you 
couldn't live there anym ore.  So the neighbor tookus. W ehad nothing anywa y.  So she just 

m oved over to the neighbor.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  How did
 
yo u
 
sort of  regroup after this? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  I spent two m onths in the hospital. My m otherwas with the neighbor. I 

did say tom y m other,you know, well
,  
m aybe now I can say who I am . And she said, youcan't 
because there was aPogrom .  Af ew people cam e out of hiding andthe Pols killed them . 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Still anti
-
S em it ism .
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Unfortunately yes.  I know that not everybody was like thatbutthat was 

what happened in m y town.  So she said, you know, you can't say who you are
;  yo
u've got to 
s t a y.
 
 
T he nurses were the nuns. And they were wonderful. They saved m y hand.  So I'm 
ver y gratef ulfor that. 
 
 
My m other startedthinking of putting in announcem ents tof ind m yfatherbecause 
he hadabsolutely no idea that we were alive.   So she started knitting again.  She also 

go t
 
--
 
the doctor toldher shehad probably cancer.  So she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  
S o  s he
 
had to have an operation as well.  Soshe went into the hospital
 
as well.  The lady, the 
next doorneighbor, was helping us. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Soright after liberation, in1945, 1944, 1945, she's diagnosed with breast 
cancer.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  She was operated on.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Did she reunite with your father? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell,f inally she put in
 
an announcement andwe foundhim .  He sent m y 
cousin who was in theBritish Arm y.  He came and he managed to get us in touch with the 

Je w
ish agency. W e wentoff to Krakow.  And then we lef t and reunitedf inally in Berlin 
som ewhere, in Munich, in Berlin.  Eventually becausem y father was part of the BritishArm y, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

we went to England. W esettled in England.  And that's where I grew up. 
 
>> 
S
usan Snyder: W hen did your m om passaway?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  My m otherpassed away in 1956.  She was only 47 years old.  She got 
cancer again. T hey tried tof ind it but, you know, in those days there were not those kinds of  

m achines that could detect it.  So she died very early.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You settled in England as af am ily.  How did 
you 
get out of Poland? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, as I said, the way we got out of Poland is the Russiansm ade som e 

kind of an agreement that they would let the Jews out, thefew that rem ained. W e sim ply went 

with a group that the Jewish agency took care of us. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Backing up a little, whendid youf eel it was ok to tell people that you were 
Jewish or to stop posing as non
-Je ws?  

>> Halina Peabody: W ell, when we were in the camp, already going out of there,
 
at one point 
they thought that we were Polstrying to pretend to be Jewish in order to get out of Poland.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Andm y m other
 
--
 
she said m y husband's name was Izak.  [Laughter] But 
f inally som ebody signed f or us.  So wef inally got through.W e wentover the border. And then 

we had trouble getting tickets. The Germ ansrefused to sell us tickets afterthe war.  You 

know, it continued.
  
W hen we got to Berlin, f inally m y f atherm anaged to get back and reunite 
with  u s. 
 

>> 
Susan snider: One m ore question beforeI open itto theaudience.  So Eva hadnot seen 
your f ather in many years
; i
n f act didn't even know him .
 
>> Halina Peabody:  She was 2m onthsold. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: 
 
Didn't know him.  Knew of him.W hat was their relationship like? W as it

>> 
Susan Snyder:  You said you were your m other's partnerand then your father cam eback.
 
>> Ha lin
a Peabody: That's right.  I became the babysitter.  It was diff icult. Everybody was 
warn out.  Everybody had a hard time to recover.  But eventually, you know, got to England 

and found
 
--
 
I found table tennis for me.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  You were a table tennis champ, right?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Later.  I playeda lotof  table tennis. T here was no tennis available. I had
 
wanted tennis. I didn't like water.  My sister was the swim m er. I was not.  But I loved tennis.  

T o this day I watch it.  I was also skating asachild.  But we dida little bit of  that, too, in 

England. 
 
 
My table tennis eventually got m e toIsrael becauseI was sentto the Maccabiah 
Games which m ademe want to gobackto Israel af ter m y mother died. The second 

Maccabiah Gam es I went and
 
I stayed therefor quite a few years.  And then because I worked 
for the Am erican Em bassy in T el Aviv we ended up com ing to the UnitedStates. I endedup 

here.

W hen you were a young girl in school and you went to schoolfor two hours aday
 
--
 
and 
thank youf or sharing your personal story with us.  Did youfeelthe sense that the other 

children would have not accepted you if  you had told them  who 
you 
were?  Did you m ake any 
f riends ordid you keep to yourself ? How didyou as a young girl m anage to keep it all together 

in a hostile environm ent?

>> 
Susan Snyder:  You were old enoughto know but still pretty young.
 
>> Halina Peabody: W ell, you grow up ver y quickly, ver y f ast. 
 
>> 
W hen you wentto Israel, did youever becom e observant? 
 
>> Ha lin a  
Peabody:  No.  I was not observant f rom the hom e.  So Iwas not observant butmost 
Israelis are notobservant. I never really hadany problem s on that score.  AndIf eel that just 

living in Israel and being part of that culture was som ething that Ineeded
 
to recover m y own 
self.  I goto Israel every year to sortof  just be part of it. I have some family f rom m y aunt 

there. Idon'tf eel thatreligion has to be partof  it. That's justm y take on it. As I said,m y 

m other said we all pray to the same God.
  
I accept that. 
 
>> 
Did you ever get to reclaim  your childhood in any way? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Did I what?
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Reclaim  your childhood in any wa y.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  No, I'm  af raid
 
no t .  I  s t illm is s  m y S h irle y T
em ple doll.

[Laughter]

> 
Susan Snyder:  Back in the m iddle.  In the red shirt.  Right in the m iddle. 
 
>> 
Is your sister still ali ve today? 
 
>> Halina Peabody: ThankGod, yes.  She is alive.  Shehasfour children.  Andthree 

grandchildren. She is in London. SoI have no choice but to travel. [Laughter]
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Goahead back there. T hen we'll have a couplein thef ront. 
 
>> 
T hank you.  Andagain, thanksf or sharing your f ascinating story.  I was just wondering.  
W ithall the experiences you've had, what goes through
 
yourm indtoday when you see people 
being targeted violently f or their religious belief s? 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Oh, God. If eel terribleabout that. W edo this work here, sharing our 

s t o ry
,  
in thehope that it will alert peopletobem ore vigilant and to
 
work hard to stop this.  W e 
are too old todo it ourselves but Ithink sharing the story is thebestwe can do.  I think weall 

realize that we are in a ver y, ver y scar y world right now and that wehave to work hard in order 

to com bat itas best as we can.  Eachone of us can contribute. T hat's m y contribution.  I'm 

sure everybody else does their part.  Ithink if we do that, we hopefor a better worldf or our 

children and grandchildren. 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Right here inf ront. 
 
>> 
Do you have children as 
well?
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Ido. I have two granddaughters. 
 
>> 
T he reason Iask, Iwork with veterans. Andm any of the veterans that serve in the wars, 
they don't talkabout their experiences to their children. I think what you did today is wonderf ul.  

I've enjoyed listening to you. 
 
>> Halina Peabody: Thank you.
 
>> 
I just wondered if you share that with your childrenand grandchildren.
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Absolutely.  T his was my greatest achievem ent thatmy granddaughter 

said she was going to m ake am ovie about it.  She likes to makem ovies.  She's 17 now.  So 

eventually I hope shewi ll but she knows everything aboutm y story.   And that's what we all 

hope, to letthe second generation know.  T hat's wh y we go to schools. W e tell the children so 

th a t th
ey areaware of  it.
 
 
Asf ar as speaking is concerned, when I stopped working, I startedvolunteering here 
thinking I never, never had spoken inthe public bef ore.  And slowly, slowl y they kind of told 

m e, you know, you ought to share your story.  I think that goesf ormost of us. We were not

speakers.  But eventually, you know, it felt that this was the right thing to do. W e talkedto the 
children. They tell us it brings thehistory to more life because it'snot just the reading
;  
it 's a lso  
hearing an eyewitness story.  So how can we not? 
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  I just want to say
 
--
 
I'm  acurator here at the m useum. W eof ten get 
collectionsf rom people whose parents also didn't speak. W e're very fortunate that the 

Museum  has 60
-
so m e
-
odd volunteers who are Holocaust survivors who do speak. But the 
m ajority of  them  speak.  There's a couple who still don't talk.  Ithink it's not
 
--
 
I don't want to 
say it's not uncom monbut I think it's sim ilar,a sim ilar experience. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:
  
And som e are very painful.  Mine ispainful butnotas painf ulas som e 
others. So I think it's harderf or some people.  And in theend you just learnhow to speakand 

you just get into your m em ory banksand tell the story as it happened. I know that people want 

to hear.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder:  Halina, we have atradition
 
--
 
I think we still have this tradition.W e allow 
the survi vor to say one last thing.  I'm going to let youdo that.  Bef ore I do, I just wanted to 

thank you very m uchfor participating.  
 
 
I'm  going toask two things of  you.  First,once Halina is done with her comments, we 
would love it if  you would just stand up soour photographer can take apictureof  Halina wi th 

you in the background.  And the other thing that I wouldask is that if you
 
have other questions, 
pleasef eelf reeto come up on stage afterwards and joinus. 
 
>> Halina Peabody:  Ok.  Well, I've already more or lessm entioned that I'm  speaking because 

I f eel that this has to be m y contribution to people, to warn them  about being
 
vi gilant and to 
work so m uchharderfor thebetter world forour children. W ehave to be strong and we have 

to work. W ehave to never f orget what can happen if  we arenot.  I just hope and pray that 

things wil l turn aroundand we will have a better world f or thefuture.
 
 
I'm  thankful to the m useumf or letting me reach such a wide audience so I can tell 
you what happened.That's why, you know, the Holocaustmuseum is m y f avorite place.
 
>> 
Susan Snyder: W e're ver y gratef ul. Thank you so much.
