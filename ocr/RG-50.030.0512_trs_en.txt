A: I was involved later on when we came to Lódz . 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was the Labor Zi onist m- mo veme nt, 
the youth group of the La
bor Zionist. In other 
words, the [indecipherable]  

Q: How would you characterize 
that group, for people who don™t 
know?  Labor Zionist, in terms 
of the political spectrum, were they on the left , 
we re they on the right, were they in the mi ddle? 
A: Well, it was in the mi ddle. Ca --  it™s in
 the mi ddle. It was sort of f -- more in a 
[indecipherable] Socialist Labor Zi
onist, you know, there were different -- different groups in the 
Zionist -- in the Zionist area. Th
ere were extreme right and extrem
e left, but this -- but not the 
zion -- in the Zionist also, the same  thing. All -- th
is was sort of more si-- like Labor 
Socialist. 
Q: Uh-huh. And were you interested at that
 point in going to Is
rael as a Zionist? 
A: Well, that  was -- 

Q: Or Palestine? 

A: -- a youth -- a youth, a very youth, 
and I think, as I can reme mber, 
we very little could assess 
the -- do -- what to do and wa -- how to go. It wa
s just -- the school was 
[indecipherable] there, 
and we were alone like
 a youth organization. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We didn™t -- 

Q: So it wasn™t very politically or iented? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
25 
 
 
A: -- we -- we did not pay much at
e -- attention to the political side. 
Q: Right. 

A: It was a yout -- was a youth 
organization, that™s all, you [i
ndecipherable] or you spend time 
singing and dancing and 
things like that. 
Q: We re you dating as a teenager
?  You were going out, or not? 
A: N -- n -- we just -- we were young. There we
re girls [indecipherable]
 some  of them, but I 
wasn™t -- was young kid still, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: And then I was involved with, when I start work
ing, I went really sort 
of more involved with 
work, with the -- with earning some thing -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- because we need at home , and I didn™t go too much to 
the youth activities. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So that was very -- when I star t working for the ladies™ tailor -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- that time I ma de my money. 
It™s better than the me n™s, and I worked for a ma n who just 
opened that place, and to my -- he™ll -- m- my lis 
-- I looked at them and I saw them -- I saw him 
that he was not -- he was not the mechanic or 
the expert, for a -- he want to have a sh -- a 
business, a shop, you know, but he wasn™t really 
a mechanic. And -- and then start working for 
him, and these jackets he made, the me -- ladies™ 
jackets, he had problems with. He couldn™t fit, 
he couldn™t see -- so he -- he -- he sort of ma de
 me work through the fitt
ing room, which was sort 
of [indecipherable] working out, and 
to take a look when he fits and see what™s wrong with his -- 
what his problem -- where the problem is, and late
r I could fix it. Wa s -- what he -- he couldn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
26 
 
 
take care of that. He couldn™t -- he wa s not in -- 
trained, or he wasn™t working with that -- with 
the ladi es™ jackets. So the -- 
Q: But you also weren™t trained. 

A: What? 

Q: You also weren™t trai
ned, but you knew some  -- 
A: Yeah, but -- but I -- but I sort of picked up the 
-- the -- the sort of techni
que a little bit better, 
even though I was just been list
ening to people talking in the -- 
what the [indecipherable] talking 
in the ma n [indecipherable] I was always listening, and I -- 

A: Right, right. 

A: -- picked up what they been talking. 

Q: Right. 

A: But I -- so I could sort of do it, try it myself
, you see, and I helped [indecipherable] of holding 
onto that type of -- that type of work. 
Q: Right. 
A: We  worked it for a couple years, and he was 
-- I could see he is 
not -- and he didn't do it 
financially good. He financially is 
-- he -- he was in debts, becaus
e he -- he went very g -- he 
thought it™s gonna -- he opened a very nice place,
 a nice sa lon, and [indecipherable] will get 
customers, but that wasn™t the answer, the answer
 was he had to go be a -- be a mechanic and do 

some thing and then you have the [indecipherable]
 and the -- but he was located a good location, 
so people -- he had a sign in, and advertise, 
in other words. And one time a lady came and she 
had a page from a ma ga zine, a coat. A -- a of -- st
yle of -- a style -- a coat
 was in the magazine 
and she picked out a page, and she brought, she wa
nts this coat. And came 
in after she walked 
out and she [indecipherable] he sa
id, I don™t know, what can I d -- 
she wants this coat and I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
27 
 
 
know what to do with that. So he shows to me , 
what do you say?  We ll, say well, we™ll -- we™ll -- 
I™ll try -- I™ll try to do it.
 And I took that piece of fabric, I don
™t know mys e lf without -- I just -- 
what I thought it™s right, I don™t kno
w if I did the right thing, and this wasn™t right, but I -- it 
wasn™t the right approach, but the right thi
ng what I thought is how
 to ma ke that -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- p-pattern, a drawing on that, [indecipherable]
 to cut. It wa s a complicated coat with 
different -- not invo -- not the separate sleeves, it
™s so -- it was a very complicated co-coat. And I 
took the fabric, put it on the cutting table and st
art ma rking on the cloth 
whatever -- according to 
measure ments. And I cut it, and sort of put it to
gether, whatever. And she came for a fitting, she 
tried on this coat, she says, oh, your
 coat is just like -- like sh
e wants it, she had -- she -- how 
could you do -- how did you do it?  I says, I don™t my
self how that -- th-t
hat™s what I started, 
that™s -- I don™t know, it cam
e from inside to my -- from my 
-- I don™t -- I didn™t, I™m sorry, but I 
didn™t see anybody cutting this way, it™s th
e wrong way, a wrong approach, but it --  
Q: It worked. 

A: -- it came out right. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t know. So -- 

Q: So did he start givi ng you more
 work because you were successful? 
A: We ll, he didn™t have so 
much -- so many customers -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- so ma ny. But he was happy that this was --
 he could -- he could satisfy the customer. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
28 
 
 
A: And the customer [indecipherable] was, sh
e would -- she would go some where else, but she 
[indecipherable]. We ll, that was s
hort -- about a year befo
re the war, this was close to the war. 
Q: It was close to the war. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Tell me  Henry, di -- were you very awar
e of what was going on in
 Germany, starting in 
™33?  You were 16 at the time. 

A: Yeah, yeah, we were aware. 

Q: You were aware? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: We re you concerned? 

A: Oh yeah, we were concerned, but we never 
talk about the [i ndecipherable], I mean, the 
developments. We  never thought it™s going to star
t a war over there. We  knew that the German -- 
the -- the situation in Germany, Jewi sh situati
on, because the -- the Nazi
s expelled all Jewish 
non-citizens, those who came from Poland. 

Q: Poland, right. 

A: And had no s -- German citizenship, they expelle
d ex -- to Poland in I 
th -- I reme mber then 
that the -- our communi ty, Jewish community tr
ied to help these people who ca me  out from 

there, and they set up a sort of a camp, and 
I reme mber we collect some , you know, money or 
some thing to s -- support this camp, or whatev
er. I reme mber this very well, the people 
[indecipherable] camp, t hey stayed -- stay in 
the -- in the camp, they had nowhere to go, they 
were expelled from Ger many. This how when
 we were [indecipherable] it was already 
[indecipherable] already -- alrea
dy a -- a grown ma n, and I know wh
at™s going on, and we sort of 
paid attention to wh
at™s going on in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
29 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. Did things get bad -- 
A: -- in concern, but we never thought of in -- 

Q: Of what?  

A: -- that they gonna invade Poland. 

Q: You didn™t. We re things 
getting bad in Poland, also? 

A: It was getting wor -- 

Q: Was it getting more anti-Semitic? 

A: I think the influence spread to Poland, the Polis
h anti-Semites, and a lot of incidents, a lot of 
anti-je -- anti-Semitic demonstrations and Jewish 
also, anti-Jewish slogans and things like that. 

They were more alive than before. 

Q: Than before.  

A: Than before, in the -- the -- 

Q: And did you see that in Lódz?

although in Lódz we had [indecipherable] we had 
one-third of the population was German, Ger man
 people who lived there from years back. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Hundreds of years. And we had Polish and Je
wish, about three equal 
parts. And Polish anti-
Se mites were real active, became active with -- with boycotts, with slogans and all kind of thing. 

They boycott th-the Jewish business -- 

Q: They did? 

A: -- the stor es, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
30 
 
 
A: The same  as they did in Germany. Don™t buy from Jews, you know, was this -- which, in a 
way they sa -- s-sort of -- was legal to -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- it -- like we -- they -- it 
was legal, they -- they could --
 and there were also physical, 
actually, incidents which -- beating -- 

Q: Anything that happened to you? 

A: What? 

Q: Anything that happened to you at -- 

A: Not that time , no.  

Q: Not that time .  

A: I wasn't  beaten or something like that -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in -- before. And then we slowly -- 
Q: Do you reme mber the beginning of the war in September ™39? 
A: Sure, sure, I reme mb er. 

Q: And were you -- 

A: But i-it wasn™t -- it -- it sort
 of -- sort of unexpected, yeah -- 
Q: Unexpected? 

A: I mean, it -- the -- it -- the dipl omatic activ
ities which were going on 
in Berlin, London and 
things like that, weren™t -- no one 
-- I mean, th -- we didn™t know 
what -- what they been talking, 
was -- there were all this communication [indeci
pherable] that is now -- we  have now the 
television, the newspapers. We  -- 
we clearly didn™t know the little
 bit [indecipherable]. We  knew 
that the -- Hitler -- Hitler™s

Germany, how they [indecipherable] already implic
ated the -- the Nuremb ergs laws and things 
like that, we knew about that, 
and -- but nothing we could do.  
Q: Mm-h m.

course, but we couldn™
t do a thing, and just 
waiting, and -- but they didn™t talk 
about so muc h close of war -- th
at they -- the [indecipherable] 
is so close. All other things happen meanti me , 
you know, the anschluss, 
Austria [indecipherable] 
a lot of things were going on. 

Q: And you still didn™t think it 
was going to happen to Poland? 
A: Poland we did not -- not -- we 
didn™t hear so much what™s goi
ng -- what -- that  the he -- hi s 
aims  for Pol a nd. We  knew that he -- the -- the Hi
tler complain was a -- like the Volksdeutsche 
are not treated well, that sort 
of propaganda. And now we had the Volksdeutsche, German who 
lives in Poland, they were not 
treating -- treated well,
 and things like that, mi streated, or 
some thing. Ah -- what the -- it™s just th -- not -- 
not the a-act of war. And closed to the world 
[indecipherable] had the idea because the Polish st
art to get ready, the Polish army. We  saw the 
activities of the Polish army. And 
so [i ndecipherable] little tanks in the st reet, they were really 
sort of getting -- getting the aw
are, you know, what™s -- ma ybe th
ey knew more than we did -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and had -- what™s going on, what the de ma
nd -- what the Hitler de
ma nd is, or the Hitler 
dema nded, a nd he like -- like, part of Poland, 
he claime d this is German territory -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and Danzig -- Danzig is a frei stadt, and then
 he says it™s a German st-sta -- city. You know, 
you saw that there is a lo
t of complaints to Poland, and -- but never -- never thought that they 
were so close, til -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
32 
 
 
Q: Til it happened. 
A: -- til it happened. 

Q: Mm-hm. Well, you left Lódz in
 November of 1939, is that right? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: After the start of the war? 

A: -- [indecipherable] well, the war started -- wh

Lódz was bombed the first day. 
Q: It was?  

A: Yes. Not the center city, but the objects military -- military objects were bombed right away, 

right on the same morni ng. The pa

the -- that the Germans wouldn™t last long, they --
 they didn™t have -- they don™t have food, they -

they don™t -- they cannot

the people, they -- and -- 
Q: So the assumption was that  the Ge
rmans would fall, they would not -- 
A: They™re not going to fight, -- 

Q: They™re not going to fight. 

A: Because they™re not able to fight -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- what they were, they -- they were in tr
ouble with their economy an
d short of food, so how 
are they gonna -- if you™re
 going to war, you gotta have -- you 
feed an army, and certainly they 
have no -- you ca -- can™t feed an
 army. We ll, you know, th-these 
lies were fed, I don™t know, for 
a purpose -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
33 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- for what purposes, from Ger ma ny, that they™re 
poor, they haven™t -- but they have a little -- 

they have every -- they had everything, and we
 saw when they ma rched in, didn™t see any poor 
army, saw a rich army wi th all the equipment,

A: What? 

Q: In 1939 you™re 22 years old. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you™ve been working for a number of years. 

A: Yeah.

A: Yeah. 
Q: And whe r e are you going?  You™re just following everybody? 

A: Just follow the crowd. 

Q: You don™t know? 

A: No. We ™re going to Warsaw. You 
know, we me  -- it™s a long way -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- from Lódz to Wa rsaw. It is a long way. And as
 we left town, we left Lódz, the outskirt, it 
start to [indecipherable] you know
, a little morning [indecipherable] sun came out, you know, a 

little bit light er, the -- 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
36 
 
 
A: -- daylight came. The daylight -- the German
s™ planes flew over the ma ss people and spray 
them with -- so we all spread out into the ditche
s and to wherever it is 
and th-they wouldn™t let it 
go, and it wa s all day long they were flying 
over our heads and sprayed with bullets. 
Q: So a lot of people died? 
A: Oh yeah. I don™t -- not near me , but people di
ed, yeah, because the -- so it was the evening, 
we figured we™ll go in the evening, at
 night we could not go further. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We  went to the next town and this -- this
 town was bombed already and full of fire, we 
couldn™t get through. 

Q: And wha t  town was that? 

A: Brzezin. It™s the next  town from po -- a sm
all town. We  ha d the -- couldn™t get through, we 
tried to go all around this town to go past this 
town. We  ma na ged to get past this town and go 
further a few miles at night and then the next 
day the planes start again overheads. And some  
fellow, fr-fr -- he met some on the ground from s o
me  -- either it was parachutes came , Germans 

dropped -- if they dropped the paratroopers or some thing like that, they opened fire from the 

ground, not on the planes. And so we figured that 
the German army already in front of us, you 
know, cause I mean, we were -- so, there was 
no way to go further and we can™t get up 
[indecipherable]. So we leave towards the [indeci
pherable], most of the 
people went back to 
Lódz.  

Q: Really? 

A: You couldn™t go. 

Q: And you? 

A: I went also back to it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
37 
 
 
Q: You went back? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So that was in Septem
ber of ™39, right after -- 
A: Yeah, oh sure, in September, right in the beginning, yeah [indecipherable] 

Q: So you went back home . 

A: -- back home . We  wa ited [inde
cipherable] until the day [indeci
pherable] couple days, I think, 
they were the first shelling -- got [indecipherabl
e] shells over the city, and you know, like a sign, 

or I don™t know what kind of sign this was, and then they ma rched in. 

Q: And wha t  was that like? 

A: The German [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: A -- a strong army, unbeatable army. 

Q: So they were frightening? 
A: Oh yeah. They frightened and well, this was 
the army for the people didn™t -- they didn™t stop, 
they kept going. 

Q: So you didn™t stay there? 

A: We ll, not us, the others ca -- the others stayed. 

Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: The other -- behind them, they had the others
, those who occupied, but Lódz -- Lódz had one 
[indecipherable] German populati
on and they were sort of cal
led volks -- Volksdeutsche. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
38 
 
 
A: And to them it was a big, big su -- big success th
at they -- they -- they had a big -- the city 
was renamed Litzmannstadt, the German -- German hero fr om wars -- first World War, and it 
was included into the Reich, Lódz. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then the trouble started [indecipherable] 
that time , they are really going in houses and 
grabbing people to work. I -- I went to my 
place where I worked, but a couple -- once okay, 
twice I couldn™t go farther. You know, at that ti
me  I said, I™m not going. Every time I went to 
work, the nat -- [indecipherable] Nazis came to 
Lódz. First of all they had their own. And 
secondly there wasn™t any [indeci
pherable] was a German city, a
nd like all Nazis were full of 
either Nazi -- all kind of for ma
tions civi -- civilians and go -- uni
form. Whenever I walked to the 
street, and tried to go to work, 
I was beaten [indecipherable] di
rect to work, they™re being -- 
taking over offices and things [i
ndecipherable] they want to cl
ean up, so they grab people, 
Jewish people to work, and they kept us for the whole day. We worked, we worked. So I got -- I 
can™t -- it does no use to go to work, cause
 you -- you don™t go anything, you know, you just get 
yourself in trouble. So
 I didn™t go to work. 
Q: Okay. We have -- excuse me , He
nry, we have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: All right, so the Germans come  i n. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And they™re so -- 

A: Occupied. 

Q: -- cause -- occupied. 

A: Occupied. 

Q: Right. 

A: Rename d that city Litzma nnstadt. 

Q: And doesn™t a ghetto start pretty quickly? 

A: We ll, they have been talking, so right away 
-- talking about the ghetto, 
talki -- talking about. I 
mean it -- it -- I think it take -- t
ook a little -- some  times, and I wasn
™t that long over there. The -
- as -- I couldn™t go to work. 
Q: Right. 
A: I couldn™t do any -- I couldn™t go 
to work because I was beaten up few times in go to work, so 
I s -- ga ve up to go to work, because -- my friend -- I have  a -- I had a friend in the 

neighborhood, Tanchim, my friend. 

Q: Tanuchim?  

A: Tanchim,  yes. And he wa -- he ma de it to 
Wa r saw when -- where -- with -- with the crowd 

that time. 

Q: That first time? 

A: I-In the first time , but when Wa rsaw was holding on for two weeks and then they ha d to give 

up, so he came  back to Lódz. He lived in our neighborhood and we talking -- we me t -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
40 
 
 
know, we been going on and talk. The meanwhile we
 listen to the sort of kind of rumors, the 
news. Not the rumors, but the news wa s that 
German -- that England and France, they are 
helping Poland -- gonna help Poland.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They gon -- they declared war [indecipherable]
 Ger many there, because they were involved 
with the pr evious agreement of fr
iends -- friendship or some thing -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and they had to come  to help Poland. And 
then we became  in a little bit hopeful, became 
that this war isn™t going to 
last long. But I -- I my self, you know
, reme mber that Great Britain 
was a big power. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The -- the -- they -- the world big power, wo
rld power, and France is a big power, they too 
will --  will attack them fr om the other side, fr
om the -- the German will have to pull back or 
some thing, or otherwise they
™ll be in -- 
in trouble. 
Q: So that™s what you felt? 

A: That™s what I thought. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s -- that™s what I t
hought. Little we knew how -- how weak
 they were and how little they 
could do. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But we didn™t know that they really not cap
able, I thought they were
 really strong. And we 
thought this cannot last long the wa
r, cause with the help of E
ngland and o -- and France, they 
will not go further. Where we were occupati
on took place, they occupied all Poland, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
41 
 
 
[indecipherable] is sort of comi ng with the idea 
we should go east because the war, she says a lot 
of people went to the east [i
ndecipherable] Russia, took half 
of part of Poland, and so you 
figured for the time being, til they -- til they have 
to pull out -- back, we will st ay in -- and my 
mother there agreed with me , she says, go. Of co
urse, you know, it™s -- it™s -- there™s no other 
way, there™s no -- there™s no solution here now. Pr
etty soon the [indecipherable] be such a help 
that pr etty soon the -- the situation will change, 
since France and England 
got the -- st epped into 
the war. So we got -- I didn™t ta
ke lot equipment, whatever you 
could put on, two pair of pants, 
and things like th -- th-the underwears, we
 -- everything you could put on, you don™t take lu-
luggage or some thing. 

Q: Right, right.  

A: And Tanchim and myself, we took -- 

Q: Wa s it -- l-let me  ask you some thing. Wa s that a difficult -- 

A: What? 
Q: Wa s that difficult to do, to l
eave your mother and your sister? 
A: Is what?  
Q: Was it diffi cult, that day? 

A: Was it diffi cult? It was 
a little --  it -- I think it was a sort
 of general kind of -- a lot of people 
were doing the same , so you -- you don™t question 
it too much, and you figured this -- it™s a 
temporary thing, or something like that
. Because I couldn™t go to work -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you couldn™t he lp them, and they didn™t work, 
because of the -- so, whatever it is, my sister 
and my mother stayed home . And I 
took off with Tanchim. I ma de th
e trip to go to the -- to the -- 
to Malkinia. Malkinia was the last stop to the Russian border. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
42 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: At the Russian border -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that was the only part of dry land where 
the -- the other parts of 
the border had the boke -- 
that river, and to go to the ri
ver is more difficult, so people 
took the easy way, is go to the dry 
land, to the ri -- there™s a no ma
n™s land, they said -- I mean, 
I didn't -- we didn™t know then 
what™s -- what™s going on over there, because we
 went to -- we  couldn™t go direct, we had to go 
to Wa rsaw. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And take another train. We
 couldn™t ride the train -- 
Q: So first you went to -- 

A: -- Jews couldn™t ride the trai
n, we had already then, by then, th
e -- the yellow lata, the lel --  
yellow patch. You di -- 
Q: You did already? 
A: Oh, we did already wear -- that was right away
 fr -- right from the first day, we had to wear 
the yellow p -- the yellow patch, yellow lata, an
d [indecipherable] we took off the latas, the -- 
Q: You took them off?  

A: Took them off, because Jews were not allowed 
to ride  on the train and 
we couldn™t get tickets, 
so could recognize us Jewish, so Tanchim™ s girl
friend, a girl was so different, she put on the 

scarf, and the thing what -- ah. She we nt ove
r in the -- bought -- bought two tickets for us, and 
we got a train to Wa rsaw. So the train was at 
night, th-the right -- you know, it was good because 
it was dark. Whenever the cont -- the German cont
rol came up on -- in the car
, there were a lot of 
people, we sort of pushed ourselves into the -- in
 the toilets while they were checking passports, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
43 
 
 
pa -- checking the I.D.™s or some thing, the German 
patrols, we were in the -- in the toilets, a-and 
then we came out. Anyhow, he ma de it -- 
Q: Did your I.D.™s have a J in it? Did they know that -- they knew you were Jewish from your 

I.D.? 

A: They knew, they -- yes. 

Q: There was a -- 

A: Jude -- J -- Jude. 

Q: Jude, there was, yeah. 

A: Then we got to Wa rsaw. I had a distant c
ousin and we stayed overnight over there. And 
Warsaw was a different -- it wasn™t the Thir
d Reich, it was the Polish governme nt, the Polish 
police and things like that, andpeople were not that -- sort 
of under the impression -- under the 
same -- it wasn™t the same kind of government, it 
-- it -- temporary. They so
rt of -- there were a 
lot of bla -- black ma rketing and people -- pe
ople were running around, and my cousin -- s -- I 
stayed with my cousin overnight one day -- 
overnight. The next day we took the train to 
Malkinia, cause there was a direct 
trai n. And that was a lot of -- th
ere were a lot of Jewish people 
in the train because everybody was going to 
the border, to the Ru-Russian border. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And the -- at the -- at the end of the Malk
inia, the train stopped and we -- everybody -- they 
said, everybody out, because that™s
 the last stop. So, we can™t st
ay on the train. So everybody has 
to leave and you couldn™t leave be
cause there was rows of S.S., both sides, and you cou -- they 
wouldn™t let you go no place til the train pulls 
out, and they li-lined up everybody, all these 
people in -- in -- in a line -- in
 lines, and ma rched away. And took 
us into a -- half
 a mile maybe, 
to this in -- their pl ace -- thei
r place, I don™t know, a place, some
 place. It was a courtyard, big 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
44 
 
 
yard -- big courtyard and they put us in -- in
to this courtyard and S.S. guy -- S -- S.S. guys 
around us, you know, marching back and forth round th
e people and they all gave us orders. First 
they said -- put up our hands in the air. We  star
ted in the morning, we stay there all day long. We  
didn't know ma  -- S.S. what™s going on, what this
 -- kind of game  this is. Towards the evening, 
about -- I guess what [indeciphera
ble] about four o™clock in 
the evening, in -- towards the 
evening, I didn't even know when they start taking
 in people into the -- th
ey™re all around w-were 
barracks, small barracks in
 the courtyard. And when I di -- a
ll people who mar -- is -- were taken, 
so now our time  is to go into this separate room th
at -- that lead us -- they 
let us come to the end -
- toward the end of this pl ace, there™s a bar -- 
a barrack, a wooden barrack and we going into this 
-- to go into this place. I don™t 
know -- I di dn™t know what -- what™s for, everybody in. As we got 

into this barrack, the hall -- the first hall is s --  lo
w tables like that, a lot of tables, low like this, 
about 10 people at each table, hours
 we have to stand around, and 
here cames the S.S. ma n with 
the worker here, the ma n, he says, give up ev
erything what you have, 
all the valuables and 
money. Put this on the table. He says, those 
who wouldn™t, and you have hidden some place, 
we™ll find it. You™ll get shot. You™
ll be shot. And that™s all. Well,
 there were some people there, 
there were some  people not [ind
ecipherable] but most people, th
ey put out everything, watches, 
what -- everything, jewelry, yeah, whatever. I didn™
t have mut -- money, I had one 50 zlotys my 
mother gave me , says, you need it, have some thi
ng, it™s not much of mo ne
y. So I had sewed it in 
-- in a -- in a place in the coat -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- which, I mean, if you look good, if you try 
to, you ma ybe -- but it™s
 a little paper money, 
and they™re not going to y -- after they cleaned up
 the tables, whatever they have, and now you™re 
going to check to con -- we™ll see if 
you didn™t hide it, we gon -- to search you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
45 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: There was another table, and --
 a big one, and an S.S. ma n to each table. He says come  over, 
and I -- I didn™t move so fast, he had a cane w
ith a round handle. He took his cane with the -- 
pulled me with the --  

Q: The hook? 

A: -- the neck -- no, the candle he put -- the can
e put as my -- around my neck and pulled me  
over to his -- to hi -- closer, that I wa sn™t 
close enough, to search me . 
And he [indecipherable] 
says, open your coat. I open my coat, I had 
a good coat on, you know, I ma de it for myself. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I had a good shirt on, and another pair of 
pants, and another -- I been dressed up okay 
[indecipherable]. So he tried to -- 
he says to me , where did you hide  the money?  I says, I have no 
money. A watch?  No, I don™t wear watches. So 
he didn™t think long, he looked at me , and he 
took that cane and he gave me  over -- hit me  
over twice, over my head, and blood started, came 
down my face, and I was [indeciphe
rable] and I stand s-stiff, a
nd I don™t move. I -- he says, now 
you gonna give me  the money, or gonna gi -- you 
gonna get the other -- you gonna get again the 
same  thing. I said, I don™t have money. He says 
to me , [indecipherable] 
you was tailor, where did 
you hide the money?  You know, I did not tell him I™m
 a tailor, but he says, you were a tailor, you 
know, you -- where did you hide the money?  I says, I 
didn't hide it, I don™t have it. He gave me  
another hit and go. And as -- and he gave me  -- 
and had to go out. On the way out everybody was 
-- those who were checked were lined up to go out.At the wa y out on this -- there was a sole of -

- sort of a wa lk, and the both sides we re S.S. 
people with sticks, or 
pipes, or whatever -- 
whatever you had in the hand, and you have to 
go through and they hit you. So I didn™t have 
nothing, I put my hands  over my he ad, you know, you ju
st protect -- I had already hit my -- over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
46 
 
 
the head, so I put -- protect my head and I s 
-- kept running and they been hitting both sides. 
Finally we got out. He let us go out, we cam
e in into the no ma n™s land, the no ma n™s land 
between the Soviets and the German. There were
 so ma ny people, ma sses of people, wome n and 

children. And the Russian 
guard wouldn™t let through. 
Q: Wouldn™t let anybody through? 

A: No. One [indecipherable] us through and then
 people with kids come
 and beg, and n-nothing 
helps, nobody went through, nobody can do, oh, wa -- they say we have to ask -- we have to 

for mally ask for permission and we have to retu
rn then, if you get the 
permission, then you -- if 
you get a permit, we™ll let you through. So days 
-- there were 14 days on that cold winter 
Nove mber days, and snow and rain. So the only th
ing we had, some  peddlers have bread to sell, 

so there was some  bread and [indecipherable]. That
™s all we could get. And day by day we talked 
to [indecipherable]. On the 14
th
 day we saw some, you know, [indeci
pherable] in the morning. It 
was a nice morning and the -- wasn™t snowing an
d raining. We saw in the distance that some  
people s -- go through, and they sort of disappear, 
they go into the woods. On the other side were 
wooded areas where the Russian gua
rds were there. So I said, ma ybe that is the good way. So we 
thought this is probably smugglers, which they kn
ow and -- where to -- wh
ere there is a better 
passage. 

Q: Right. 

A: So we did follow them, we went through 
the border, and nothing, nobody check. I mean, no 
guards or nothing, you know, cause they knew wh
ether it -- it was bribe some body or some thing, 
I don™t know, the smugglers maybe they have a 
way of bribing guards or whatever. We didn™t 
see any guards and we went towa
rd the [indecipherable] and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
47 
 
 
Q: Did you know where you were going?  Did you 
-- I mean, did you have a destination?  You 
weren't sure? 
A: No. 

Q: You just wanted to get to the Russian side. 

A: Yeah. Well, the next to
wn we know is Bialystok. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The big town. But this was a small town we ca
me  over to, Bora, and in a few kilma t ersa -- ki 
-- kilometers like that, there was a 
s-station, the train station, we 
took tr -- we took the train and 
we came to Bialystok, which wasn™t far. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Bialystok was a town wall -- wall to wall 
refugees, people from the other side, every 
[indecipherable] full of people. 

Q: Really? 
A: Full. You couldn™t go into a hous
e if you -- if you wanted to go as
k for a cu -- for a drink of -- 
cup of water, or a glass of water, they wouldn™t 
let you in the house. They put -- they put -- they 
got water out to you, a glass of water, they gave 
you a glass of water and 
that™s it. Or a cup of 
water. This -- you know, they were afraid to 
let some body in the house. 
They didn™t know who it 
is, and we looked poor, some thing like that. 
Q: Right. 

A: They looked -- we looked, you know, bloody 
and -- and I-I mean there™s muddy, and -- 
muddy and bloody and so everything [indecipherabl
e]. So we walked around and we me t some  
people on the street, you know [indecipherable] 
some  people we knew from Lódz, or -- nobody 
had these -- a solution of what to do. They were
 registering -- the govern
me nt registered people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
48 
 
 
to go to coal mi nes to work. If you wor -- they sa
y, if you register, we can, in a week or so, or 
two weeks, you mi ght get the -- you go to work. Well,I really didn't want to go to the coal mi nes 
[indecipherable] then we didn™t 
go too far, and now soon we gonna go back home , so we had -- 
don™t want to go so far up in the [indecipherable] 
in the coal mi nes. And so there was no place, 

so we got -- the evening -- towards the eveni
ng, there was no place where 
to go to sleep. So I 
went a shul. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we slept in the shul, on a bench. And 
the next day we  go again out in the street, 
[indecipherable] again the people, they come  in
 the evening -- we come in the evening to 
[indecipherable] where we slept, some  like that, 
some  other people came and they s -- they took 
our place. [indecipherable] it™s not mi ne, you 
know, I couldn™t, you know, how -- how could you 

-- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the stre
ets, we start walking the 
street. We  didn™t have -
- we have no place where to go. So we figured, 
well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains 
were running, should take a train 
to the next sma ll town, some wher
es, whatever it is, another -- 
another 50 - 70 miles, maybe it™s 
better there, there aren™t th
at ma ny people over there. Here, 
everybody sticks to one place. So we 
got to the station, to the train 
station, we get -- they wait -- 
waiting in line for tickets, and the ma n, a Jewish 
ma n [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks 
at us, says where you going?  I said, we ™re going 
next town. What™s the ma tter, he says, you got 
relatives there?  So why you -- what kind of che -- 
what you do?  I said, we™re 
tailors. We all of u 
-- we all of us were tailors, 
three of us. [indecipherable] me
 and Tanchim, we met a guy, one 
guy, another friend of ours on the border, we took hi
m along, so we™re three of us. Oh, tailors, he 
says, I™m going to a town where my daughter lives and 
I™m sure it™s a better 
town than here, it™s a 
little further, and you™ll be better off. Y-You
™re tailors, I™m sure you™ll get work over there, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
49 
 
 
you™ll get settled down, things like 
that. We ll, it™s okay, we™ll go w
ith -- we  go with you. No, he 
says, we™ll go with you. Why yi -- how co -- we
 don™t have where to sleep, so -- where to go, 
where to stay, with whom. So he says, for two guys, 
my daughter has a little 
sofa -- a sofa in the 
li -- I™ll gi ve you the sofa, and you™ll [indecipherabl

Bara novich, and as he promised, we got to his 
daughter at night, and -- 
and he told her that he brought two 
-- two guests, you gotta give them 
where to sleep. So he give us the soft  and two 
of us slept the sofa and then my third one, 
Tanchim ha d -- he went to a -- to the shul, the ne
xt -- was around the corner
 a shul, and he says, 
well, plenty room in the shul says, if you want
 to [indecipherable] til we
™ll get -- til you find a 
place. So we had the -- where to stay. In th
e morning we start out 
looking for work. You know, 
you stay, we want to work, and do -- ma ke it 
to -- live on some thing, you [i ndecipherable] you 
need some  money. You know, looked around, we walk
ed around the city, and my one fire -- one 
friend of mi ne found work, from 
the three of us, found a job, he 
was a ladies™ tailor, he found a 
good job -- a good job, a job [indecipherable]. We 
-- I think I walked out another wa -- we

 over to -- behind us, he was a -- and then he 
came over, he says, I™m a rabbi, what are you? Y
ou look -- you refugees? Yes. You -- what is it

says, my mother has a house. You stay in the 
house, and then you could do -- ma ke it and she [indecipherable] a house, has a machine and 

everything. First of all, it was 
a good idea, the house. She got a 
house [indecipherable] got in the 
house because it was bi tter cold, and we just turn
ed around the streets and we were frozen ca -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512

and now, even though we didn™t -- it was very cold, 
and na -- just the feet are wet because of 
snow. So we  got and warm upped ourself a little b
it. She sort of was rea
lly still [indecipherable] 
his house wa s a little -- a little, small house,
 and it was warm, you know, 
little cats on the -- on 
the chair, little cat was warming on the oven. It wa s such a peaceful house, and the -- this lady, 
old lady is putting in firewood and 
taking [indecipherable]. So I says
, it™s -- it™s -- it™s such a 
good place, you know, you could stretch out the legs 
and things like that. 
And I start working on 
the coat, without no knowledge what to do with it, 
but I start working, and I stretched the work it 
should take a little longer. I™d never ma de a coat
, but I ma de it. My friend helped, and working 

[indecipherable] we ma de his coat. 

Q: Your second coat? 

A: What? 

Q: Your second coat? 

A: No, for he -- for this ra -- 
Q: For him.

my brother was, you know, he knew how 
to make the patte
rn, so he cut. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I didn™t know until I sort of reme mber little 
bit just what they be en talking. So I went out 
the street and we just finished the coat just out 
in the street, you know, out 
in the street. We  -- so 
we always met in the -- there wa
s a cafeteria, a big cafet
eria, and all those refugees came  in the

ca -- to the cafeteria. With a gla

Q: We ™re going to have to stop you, cause 
we need to stop the tape. So you™re --

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: We  left -- before the last tape you were sa

We met a lot of people which we -- I 
mean not because I knew them before. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  me t people, talked, sit and talk. And we 
had just like sharing information. I heard about 
the sending packages to -- to po 
-- to ghetto, wi -- and my frie
nd Tanchim, we went out on the 
ma rket and we -- and we -- and we co -- buy -- 
buy food. We ma de a package, we send back to 
ghetto. We figured we just -- you know, we really weren™t sure th -- if they will get it. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But let™s do it. S-Suppose maybe they get it, b
ecause people said the --
 the -- the mail is being 
delivered, or some thing. And we [indecipherable] 

Q: How did you know where they were living? 

A: What? 

Q: How did you kn --

A: Yeah. The ghetto was -- now, we were in the ghetto befo -- before. Th -- in other words, it™s a 

Jewish area, and we lived there in that house befo

Sure enough, after the war when my brother su
rvived, he says they 
got this package -- 
Q: They did. 

A: -- and it was food, which they said they -- was as

but it -- the other one i -- they didn™t. 

Q: They didn™t. 

A: So, but it wa-was later on, I guess they ch

whatever. So in the beginning, the packages were 
delivered, or mail were 
delivered to the -- to 
the ghetto.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
57 
 
 
A: We ll, okay, I was okay, but I di
dn™t have -- I had -- I just thi
nking about my mother and sister 
home. I wasn™t easy -- 
Q: Easy, right. 

A: -- it wasn™t -- I coul dn™t be peaceful. Had my
 - -  my -- my thoughts, my  -- were of -- from -- 
from my -- from home. 

Q: Did you think you wanted to go 
back?  Did you th
ink about that? 
A: We ll, that™s -- that™s what I thought, to go ba
ck, because soon they were came  -- there were so 
ma ny peopl e, and the governme nt could not help
 themself, you know, how 
to control these mass 
of people. 

Q: Mm. 

A: Refugees. So they start to have -- ma ke 
hi m ci tizenship. Alre -- 
a passport. If you get a 
passport -- you know, every citizen
 over there got a passport. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: If you get a passport, you™re citizen, and 
therefore you -- you -- you can go to work, or you 
can -- you can be treated -- I mean, treated as a ci
tizen, you don™t have to -- people live without -
- oh, they have to co -- have -- they had to ha
ve control of everybody, but 
there was loose people, 
they™re not registered no pl
ace, they don™t have -- 
Q: They don™t [indecipherable] 
A: -- they -- they don™t -- they don™
t know who is here, who is there,
 so they declared the citiz -- 
if they wa -- if they -- to next -- to the summ
er -- well, after six months or something -- three 
months, they ask all the people, 
the refugees to come  and get a s -- a pa ss -- a citizenship. We ll, 
we got to the office, everyone was called in individua
lly to this offi -- to the office, and declared 
what you goin -- what you expect to be, 
you know, you gonna get a citizen, you gonna become  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
58 
 
 
citizen, and you can go to work, you can work or
 we will get you work, we™ll -- you wanted the 
governme nt™s protection. And so a lot of people 
came  with -- by themselves, without wife, they 

left the wife and kids over in 
-- back home . Mothers [indecipher
able] mother, you see. So when 
they came out from the sa -- ask them what they
 ask you questions, you said th -- the guy is, I ask 
him, I said -- they ask me to -- to become citiz
en, so if you -- and gave 
me  the -- the rules, if 
you™re citizens -- if you™re a citizen -- in ot her words, you can™t go back to Poland, you cannot 

bring your fa mily, a lot of restrictions. Now,
 there was one thing, you can™t go back and you 
can™t bring your fa mily. So a lot of the people di
dn™t accept that and they 
came out and they says, 
well I wouldn™t leave my  wife and kids home, an
d I will sa y hey, I don™t want to stay here. So a-
at the end, if you don™t accept the 
citizenship, you got to give  them in -- a place where you want 
to go, sort of like a nice [i ndecipherable] want to 
go to America, you want to go to -- to -- well, 

ma ybe we want to see -- they 
put it on, but it doesn™t ma tter -- 

Q: It doesn™t ma tter? 
A: They put it on on the paper. 
Q: Right. 

A: But they -- but these people 
wh-who didn™t want to take citi
zenship, I -- my friends, the two 
friends, took the citizenship.  

Q: You didn™t. 

A: I didn™t. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And first of all I didn™t because  I ha d been
 thinking home and I want to go back home. And I 
was trying to go back home  and th
e borders, they were really tight
. It was hard to get through. So 
I came back and I -- I mean t -- I went to the 
border [indecipherable] and I couldn™t get through. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
59 
 
 
So I came back and -- and when I asked for citizenship, I didn™t take the 
ci -- I didn™t take the 
citizenship. And after some  ti me s 
-- after a few weeks, a week or so, they too -- they round up all 
the people that didn™t take citizenshi
p, they put them in the trains -- 
in the freight trains is -- to go 
to send them away. 
Q: And whe r e?  Which direction?  To si -- 

A: Out into Siberia or something -- 

Q: Siberia, I see. 

A: Or out, I figure it is Si beria, there™s -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- everything that go
es east is Siberia. 
Q: Is Siberia. 

A: Is Siberia. To the -- to the bear -- white bear
s [indecipherable] called the white bears, and they 
-- so I didn™t sleep at all in my [indeciphe
rable] I didn™t sleep 
all yeah, that night. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So -- and they took everybody and they put them
 on a train, I figured, so if they didn™t take 
me  now, and I have no passport, we were again 
-- again a -- again ena 
-- illegal or some thing. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I avoid to go out, as I don™t wanted to be 
arrested. If you have -- 
if you check -- if you -- 
they check you and they -- you have no passport, a
nd -- so after the transpor
ts went away -- went 
east, they -- all the trains and 
in two days later, they s -- gave
 a chance, a second chance, those 
who didn™t get the passport who mi s sed the tr
ain, in other words, you can get now the 
citizenship, the passports. We ll, then I had no ch
oice and I took the pas -- took a passport, and 
became a citizen. So, whatever. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
60 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Whatever itis. 

Q: So now you™re a Russian citizen? 

A: A Russian citizen. And well, we™ll see what
™s going on and everybody™s not -- I™m not the 

only one, there™s a lot of people,
 there are a lot of people we
re -- were -- I had no choice. 
Q: Right. 

A: It™s not my choice, but the -- 

Q: Right. So is this 1940, do 
you think?  A year -- it™s --

and ask -- be arrested and ask you where do you 
live, who -- where do -- how do you live, where 
do you wa -- are you l-live from black ma rket or some thing, you di --

Q: Wa r. 
A: Unexpected. 

Q: Again unexpected. 

A: I -- totally unexpected. Before, I wa -- Germ
any and there was a situation the -- with the 
[indecipherable] or things like that
, and tense -- tense situation. Bu
t this here I -- was completely 
unexpected invasion. [indecipherable]
. And my fr iends were just on vacation and -- and we were 
in a country -- a countryside near
 a lake, we saw scatterns of fly -- of plane -- planes are flying 
through, we didn™t know. So the Russian guy -- ther
e were some  Russian people, oh, th-those are 
ours. Th-Those are ours. 

Q: Right. 

A: Little they knew that the German, the Air For
ce already bo mbed the railroads and things like 
th -- some other -- not where we were, that was the little countryside. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: But th-they start bombing right away, and it ju
st -- at 12 o™clock at 
noon the war, the -- the 
invasion -- the German invasion started four o™
clock in the morning, and at about 12 noon there 
were the first time we found out there™s a war, 
cause there was on the radio a speech -- Molotov, 
the foreign secretary -- yeah, foreign mi nister, 
had a speech that the German forces attacked 
unexpectedly us, [indecipherable] that was the first 
time  they said there™s be a war. And we start 
running home . We ca me to the -- 
to the nearest st -- the railro
ad station, there were so ma ny 
people taking -- go -- running back, running back to 
their place at home, from the country. So we 
went back to Baranovich, finally. And we dug shel
ters and the bombing wa
s daily and -- and the 
-- the news, the Soviet news was very fals
e news that the -- we counterattack -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
68 
 
 
A: -- you know, we -- you know, we 
beating back the Germans here
 and there, which was a lie. 
But -- 
Q: So they did the same  thing the Polish government did before. 

A: [indecipherable]. But the -- but the propaganda is to keep the peopl
e -- I don™t know, what -- 
what is it, it™s mi sleading the people, because we
 didn™t think of evacuatin
g, a-and we could have 
evacuate ourselves the day be
fore. But then it was -- 
Q: Did you believe it? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Did you believe what the Russians were saying
?  That they would beat them back?  What did 
you think? 

A: I bel-be lieve, because I believed it [indeci
pherable] that the -- there was a statement -- 
statements you know, fr om the highes
t people there, that we are st
rong and we beat back and we 
me  -- you know, [indecipherable] you know, you take
 it some thing is tr -- yeah, you know, you 
take it as they say. 

Q: Right. 

A: But they were lies, they woul
dn™t really -- it wa s just the o
pposite. So, it was really when we 
start to, in towards th
e evening, you saw a little bit change 
in the people we re sort of running 
around too much like -- like undecided what to do, lik
e in running to the stat
ion, to the railroad 
station. And my tal -- friend Tanchim is running to
 the railroad station, he says, I™m going. And I 
was going out in the streets to find out some  othe
r people, what to do. Are they going really to 
the evacuate? Are they going to the railroad stat
ion to get a train to go 
back east? So we me t 
some  people, refugees comi ng from the border.
 They say what do you -- what are you sitting 
here?  We  are being chased by the Germans here
. German forces are chasing us. And you™re 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
69 
 
 
sitting here just calmly like that? Then we start 
running to the -- it was too late already, because 
we run to the railroad station, 
this -- there wa -- the -- the tr
ains were bombed already, the 
railroads were bombed, the rails were bombe
d. And we couldn™t go. We  s t art going on foot. 
Again, they attacked us with 
the flying planes, he didn™t -- we  couldn™t go any further, we 
couldn™t evacuate, couldn™t leave. So, we had to go 
back, within days -- within days they were -- 
they were back. 
Q: They were back. 

A: They were -- they were -- 

Q: They were in -- they were -- 

A: -- [indecipherable] yeah, they were occupie
d. [indecipherable] what the army ca me . We  saw 
the armi es comi ng through. Huge armi es, strong. A
nd the first day we didn™t see, but right away 
they came at us, along with the -- they start 
looking, and you know, looking -- looking for Jews. 
Q: Right. 
A: Jewish people, where the Je
wish people?  You know, they found out right away. They came to 
our house, soldiers, and they looking for -- they 
are searching for arms, they said, we gonna look 
for arms. Whatever they found, little
 valuable things, they took it. 
Q: They took it. We  have to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
70 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Okay. On the last tape you began to talk about
 the German occupation when they first -- when 
they first came  in, and wh
at that was like for you. 
A: You™re talking about in -- in Baranovich -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- the sa -- the Soviet -- 

Q: After -- 

A: -- the German Soviet war. 

Q: Right, right, 1941 

A: 1941. 

Q: Right. 

A: That™s what I -- we had a vacation. When I -- from our -- 

Q: Yes. 
A: -- the factory we worked was closed, we we
nt on vacation. And on the vacation we just saw 
the planes and things like that. We didn™t know
 until about two o™clock -- 12 o™clock when we 
came home , we heard the speech officially, when
 they announced that Germany attacked, and 
then we rushed home. We rushed home , back to
 Baranovich. Trains were
 loaded already, people 
were running from all over, from the countryside
 to the ci -- to the town. Baranovich was the 
nearest town, which we lived, so we went bac
k. Comi ng back was really -- the town -- the 
situation of early war time . [i
ndecipherable] were bombing, and ai
-air attacks and things like 
that. You have the dir -- we dug a 
shelter in the backyard. We  went to the shelters when the fliers 
came. And we listened to the radi o -- to the ra
dio, official radio. They 
had it placed all over in 
the places, in the public places where we could h
ear the news. So they re
ally sa -- mi sinfor me d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
71 
 
 
us, you know, the agency, the Soviet agency, they ha
d said that they are 
be -- beating back the 
enemy, and that will -- it™s -- wasn
™t true, it was -- they were 
right here, next door, and then 
probably we wouldn™t -- didn™t rush 
to evacuate, to go -- to run awa
y. It does -- til it was too late. 
The bomb --  the trains we re bombed, and we -- th
ey -- they couldn™t go, an
d walking, we walked 
until these pl anes, they shoot us -- shoot on us 
and -- and so we had to go back. And going back 
is -- you have to settle -- we stayed in a place, 
in a -- a home, because the war -- at a friend™s 
uncle™s house, which he lived there, in -- at his house. So he had a room, a lot of room, so one 
room he gave us, because he figured they w
ouldn™t let him have the whole house anyhow. So 
one room we -- our -- our guys, the [indecipherabl e] 
there, stayed there in 
that room, a nd til we™ll 
settle, we know what™s going on for the -- they
 had the -- meanwhile, the SS and the Judenrat, 
there was already Judenrat ap-appoi
nted, and the Juden Altesten, the 
Juden ep -- president, it -- it 
was called the Juden Altesten. 

Q: So that was pretty fast. 
A: What? 
Q: That was pretty fast. 

A: Fa -- right away. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It -- it was -- was right away ap-appointed 
and that™s it. You don™t kno
w wa -- and he -- the -- 
they were talking about a ghett
o, and what -- while th
ey talk [indecipherable] were talking. 
Meanwhile they asked for -- they put the -- the sa
y -- co-collecting valuables from the Jews. So 
they gave us -- gave orders to deliver, let™s 
say, five pounds of gold -- I mean, I don™t know five 
pounds or two pounds, silver, everyth -- or me ta
l, money, you know, currency. They want 
dollars, they want pounds, all foreign currencies.
 And -- and this had to be delivered in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
72 
 
 
meanwhile, they start already asking for worker
s -- workers. So the Judenrat was appointed 
[indecipherable] they needed workers for some  
project, we didn™t know what. So we were not 
the ci-citizen, you know, I mean, it™s not a citi
zen from Baranovich, you know, we -- we were 
refugees, so we were the first one
s to go. So we went to this wor
k, and then we start working, our 
three guys, and -- the three friends of ours went to
 work, and this was at the Air Force, German 
Air Force had a base, and they did rebuild -- not
 rebuild, but extend the 
airport. And it was the 
Polish -- old Polish airport, but th
e -- since the Air Force is -- is
 big, that they need more s -- 
more runways and more  things like that. So they took 300 people from us , from -- from Jewish -- 
from the ghetto, which wa s not the ghetto yet, but
 [indecipherable] Jewish
 people already had to 
supply workers before the ghetto
 started. And they had 300 non-Jewish people working. So there 

was about 600 people working at this airfield to re
build -- to extend the airf
or -- rebuild the airfor 
-- the air force -- the airfield. And 
I worked a terrible job, I had a 
terrible job in the -- to re -- 
unload the ceme nt, loose cement in a barn when they 
-- they put the trai ns in 
a -- they lo -- they tr 
-- the trains went into a --  gather ed into a ba
rn, a big barn and they had loose cement on the -- on 
the platforms, and it has to be removed from th
e -- from the train because that train has to go 
again. It™s just loose, this -- 

Q: How did you do it? 

A: It was so terrible work, you know
, with this -- I -- I 
felt that I wouldn™t last long really, at this 
work, it™s so hard. 

Q: Did you do it with a shovel? 

A: With a shovel, but the -- 
the dust went -- that -- that  cement was full in the air -- 
Q: Right. 

A: We ll, we worked, we had no -- this
 was -- this is the work. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
73 
 
 
Q: And who chose you?  Was it the Judenrat 
who chose you, or the Germans who cho -- how 
[indecipherable] 
A: Actually, Judenrat wants workers. They -- and 
since we s-sort of were refugees, we the first 
ones to go because the ot hers had families and thanks
 to that we have no families, so I -- I didn™t 
mi nd. I me a n, we went to work. So what is ther
e -- we can™t be -- we can
™t avoid that, we going 
to have to -- sooner or later 
we figured we™ll have to go -- we™ll do some thing. Anyhow, we 
couldn™t say no. As we worked -- as I worked ever 
d -- at this job [indeciph
erable] time, I really 
got sick from that. So at -- one morning the forema n, you know, we had this guy, Jewi sh guy was 

the forema n from 300 pe ople. In the morning he di
vided people different -- 
different play -- jobs. 
There were electricians, there we
re carpenters, you know. So one da
y he ask for a tailor, who is a 
tailor. So I raise my hands, where are tailors, bett
er to work than that. So I said -- then I star t 
working as a tailor and as soon they open -- 
they gave me  a room and a machine, and 
[indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I co
uld work. Wa s a different cha -- a big change. I 
felt, you know, now I could rec -- could -- coul
d hold on til -- I don™t know. We  worked there 
and it was in the beginning not bad. I mean, as 
slave work, we didn™t get paid. He told us, you 
are slave workers. You can™t get 
-- you get -- don™t get paid. The 
others, Friday got -- they got 
paid. The o -- the o -- 

Q: The airfield people? 

A: What? 

Q: What -- what other people? 

A: The other -- the o -- non-Jewish people. 

Q: Ah, okay. 

A: Non-Jewish people -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
74 
 
 
Q: Got paid. 
A: -- there was 300, they got pai
d. And we, we [indecipherable] th
e workers, but not paid. So -- 
and I s-set up and it was better than ceme nt work
. I had all the guy -- all these officers came  in 
for work -- kind of work, pants, some ti me s they 
had uniforms, and sometimes civilian clothes, I 
don™t know. There were so ma ny cha nges. They wore
 in the beginning civilian clothes and then 
they had a uniform. So anyway, there was always 
work to do. And I also do so -- did some  work 
for the Air Force people itself, you know, the m
ilitary, because  when they came they saw sh -- 
they [indecipherable] a ta -- a tailor, they want
 him -- e-everybody had an -- they needed. And I 
all of a sudden [indecipherable] later, a German
 officer who -- I said, 
without his permission I 
cannot do out w-work. They got it. He gave them 
permission. They gave -- they -- I should work 
-- I worked for y -- al -all other officers in the Air 
Force. In the Air Force -- course the Air Force 
building was right near --
 nearby, and a lot of of
ficers. In the beg -- 
Q: So you™re living there? 
A: What? 
Q: You™re living there,
 near the airfield? 
A: We didn™t live ther e. 

Q: No?  Whe r e were you living? In the same  -- 

A: We  were -- we were -- before we 
start to get --  I still lived this -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- friend™s house.  

Q: You still were ther e?  

A: Yeah, we™re there, but sl
owly we moved to the ghetto. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
75 
 
 
A: What I still -- we still went to work in 
the morning and we came back, you know, with the -- 
we had the I.D. card and when they put together th
is ghetto, there was a -- a gar -- a guard in -- in 
the front of the gate, and you gotta show -- and yo
u showed him the -- to go to work and then 
they come  to work, ya -- they -- or they sear
ched you if you have a package, they searched, and 
to -- so I went on with that, I worked, and we he
lped ourselves a little bit because we have people 
comi ng in, different people, different kind of
 people, nobody checked me  what I do, or what 
[indecipherable] I do. I did some  side work. So I ma de -- you know, to go through 
[indecipherable] to -- to ma ke some t hing to 
go -- you know, people s -- usually everybody gave 
something. You know, no matter -- th
e officers, they -- to -- the guy around me  -- had one guy 
who was a ta -- a tall guy, a big 
strong guy, he was -- he was so mean, a nd when he came  in to 
have work done and he always brought some thing. 
Bread, butter, and things
 like that, and he was 
in charge [indecipherable]. So -- so rem -- he 
[indecipherable] in a way that you could -- he 
could have a -- you know, stay in [indeciphera
ble]. He didn™t bother us. I worked, nobody came  
in to check me , what I wad -- what I work, but I 
wa -- they were -- just want the acceptance if 
they came -- outside people, if they came  in, they want to have them h-have the um -- our -- pi -- 

pi -- our officers should give 
them permission. They got it. 
Q: Are they killing Jews
 at this point, do you know? 
A: At the what?  At the -- 

Q:  I n  t h e ar ea. 

A: In the area? 

Q: Yeah. Do you know anything? 

A: When you first -- you saw 
the ghetto, well, people went out to work, and this was one guy 
who -- a tailor who had his own shop, and it ha -- got
 in a -- when he -- they want him to give up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
76 
 
 
the shop. He had a tailor -- his stor
e, with the business. They wa
nt him to give up the business 
because he is a -- so he  formally gave up the bus
iness to a worker of his. I-In other words, it 
should have a -- a -- put a -- it™s und
er his name  is the facto -- wh
at is the business, but he took 
the -- he di -- he took the profit,
 the money or whatever it is they
 ma de. And that was finally wa -
- who -- whose told the -- I mean, 
the authorities, they s --  they
 says what he does, he was 
arrested and he was hanged, publicly on the pla -- 
on the -- before the ghetto was closed, he -- 
they asked everybody -- the people to go and see it.
 You know, that™s to scare the people up, you 
know, like the -- not to do anything on their own 
-- on the -- on the -- what they wanted is 
[indecipherable]. We ll, anyhow, these things occurre
d and they also here 
and there, when they 
need workers or they need people, they™ve been
 taken away, they never -- we never saw them 
back. So that was until the ghetto was in a -- a 
-- still a set up and they had a one me ter -- they 
gave us one meter per person. One meter space in 
a -- in a -- you have a room like that, and you 
can put eight, 10 people. So ei
ght every -- one meter per person. 
Q: One me ter? 
A: One me ter. So they -- they measured 
-- you know, that was, you know, it -- handled it 
perfectly, I mean, they adore us. And we set up 
the ghetto pretty good, the doctors -- the doctors 
set up a sort of hospital inside 
to handle the sick people, and 
everything was working, organized. 
So I don™t know if they liked that, probably didn™tlike that organized kind of a -- a ghetto, pretty 

sure. Anyhow, one day they came to ask for -- for 12 doctors. The SS gave always orders what 

they want. You know, one time they want gold, wanted silver, and -- an
d one day I was out of 
work and I was grabbed as a hostage -- as a ho
stage for a -- because they demand some amount 
of -- of money or something like 
that, it took a long time to get toge
ther, to get the -- collect the 
money from people. So they took a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
77 
 
 
Q: So you were a hot -- the Germans took you as a hostage? 
A: Yeah. Even though I been w -- I had the -- a -- ev
en though I had a -- a I.D. to -- I worked in a 
-- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- a German place, it -- it di -didn™t ag -- 
they didn™t care about that, who -- everybody™s on 
their own, they have a different law, the SS has di
fferent laws. So they again took us into a place 
where -- enc-enclosed place, about -- I don™t know,
 couple of hundred people, hostage s, and they 
threatened they will kill us if 
they are not delivered. And the whole day long we been with our 
hands up and the machi -- the machine guns al
l around, and watching these -- the few hu -- the 
people who were not the hostages. And towards th
e evening, ar -- they to
ok out nine people and 
they s -- and they did, they said
 they gonna shot them, execute them to show them tha t  they mean 
business, the Judenrat, they should give -- th
ey didn™t deliver enou -- 
along -- soon enough the -- 
the ransom. So they killed 10 people -- nine people. 
So -- so then the Judenrat tried to give -- de-
deliver the -- deliver the ransom
 and we were freed in -- toward
s the evening. That™s one thing. 
So every day it was some other ki
nd of -- sort of action again. 
Q: What -- what -- what was happening to you
?  Were you getting de presse d, were you getting 
angry?  

A: Depressed. 

Q: Do you -- do you -- do you reme mber what it was feeling like?   

A: I don™t reme mber, we just followed the others, and -- 

Q: So you were just going to keep going. 

A: Keep going. Keep going as long as -- as we coul
d physically. Mentally, ju
st kind of -- it was 
[indecipherable] thing, you know. So you [indeciphe
rable] of -- the ambiti -- you know, a mbition 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
78 
 
 
of doing -- of getting out or some thing like that, 
and there™s no way out. No way out. And every 
day some thing else, they took people. And I worked
 over there, I worked 
as a -- in the shop, so 
the best thing was at work, so they didn™t -- 
he couldn™t -- you know, at 
-- at work we weren™t 
bothered with the -- the SS didn™t 
bothered with SS, we, as work
ers we had a lot of people, 
everybody worked at his job was -- was a kind of relief -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- because when we got back to the city, you 
locked up in the ghetto, you just like a -- oh, a 
closed -- closed world, you know, you -- you -- th
-then it depressed when you come  home, when 
you come to the ghetto. But s -- it 
-- it -- th-the [indecipherable] 
we were thinking of escape, but 
we had no arms, we had nowhere, nothing to escape. You sort of need some  ar ms. Well -- 

Q: So who -- who are you talking with?  Or
 is -- is there a -- is there a -- 

A: The ghetto people -- people in ghetto, ma ybe 
our -- my -- my friends and myself, we were 
talking about -- about es
caping. But there was tho -- we ha -- 
we really didn™t know the area, we 
didn™t know enough. So we waited, we
 had prepared ourself to es
cape and some thing, but we did 
not move until we™ll get either  some bigger grou
p or something like that. Meanwhile, pe -- we 
heard a lot of people being killed. Besides that
, every time there™s a
nother incident, another 
reason. We  had this -- where we worked we had a 
one officer who was a supply officer, was this 
Smith and he was -- he™s lo -- a nice -- you 
know, nice guy, nice guy. He was doing -- so the 
fore ma n was from Wa rs aw and he had -- he says 
he had ma de trip to -- to Poland. So we ask 
him, just a joke, you know, can I go with you?  He
 says yes. He took him to Wa rsaw to his 
fa mily, he saw his fa mily in -- in -- in Wa rsaw
 and he™s -- when he came back he says, oh, 

Warsaw is -- is [indecipherable] there™s no thr
eat of being killed, you know, like here, we have 

every day. So he was working hard to go back to Wa rsaw. He was always dreaming -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
79 
 
 
Q: To get to Warsaw. 
A: -- to go to -- back to Warsaw because it™s 
so bad here, every day people being ki lled. And 
anyhow, he -- he didn't succeeded, you know, cause
 it was -- waited too long, this Smith wa -- 
the Smith was gone and another -- he -- he cont
acted even -- ma de a deal with another guy, a 
German cha uffeur who drove and he
 collected so me friends from 
Wa rsaw, those who want to go 
to Wa rsaw. He -- he brought such a beautiful pi
cture of Wa rsaw, the black ma rket is so busy, 
what -- he saw the good things, I don™t know. I-It 
was a bad -- but the Wa rsaw ghetto wasn™t bet 
-- much better, but he saw the good. Maybe his family was involved in business or some thing 

like that. And so when he collected the all pe opl
e, those who want to go in Wa rsaw, he collect 

too the money, and the -- the chauffeur, which 
is the guy I don™t know 
how ba -- how goo -- how 
well he knew hi m, whe n he took him in the mo rn
ing -- in the morning he picked him up, he 
picked up all the passengers and he
 drove right to the SS. So -- 
Q: They killed him.  
A: They killed him, sure, right away. So, about
 the doctors, he took it -- 
they ask for 12 doctors, 
and if a doctor which I have been seeing, he to
ld me  he was a cu -- throat and -- and ear 
specialist. And so I knew hi m because I™ve seen 
him a few times, and I met hi m some other time. 
He came home running -- he came home with a satche
l from a patient and his wife told him to -- 
th -- they were here looking for you because they
 need 12 doctors, and they need for some  camp 
which -- I don™t know, it™s just the -- you know, ex
cuse, I would ge -- to ma ke the m feel good, 
that they™re going to help sick pe
ople. And he is -- was running to 
help sick people. There™s some  
[indecipherable] sick people in the camp, which 
he -- they need 12 doctors. And he mi ssed the -- 
the -- this group, I mean, other words, they were 
looking for him and they went without. But he 
came home and his wife told him, he didn™t leave hi
s satchel, he went right away to the Judenrat 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
80 
 
 
to repe -- report that the -- they were [indeci
pherable] and there was an SS ma n or something 
who still -- he still got --  incl ude him in a group, 
and they led him away and they killed him right 
at -- right in the s -- not -- you 
know, into the SS quarter -- headqua
rters. So this was the daily -- 
daily things what happened, and 
we thought of escaping. We  -- some  people tried to escape, I 
don™t know if they ma de it. They also didn™t ha
ve any arms. The time went by, we worked all 
winter, and then -- then they were really -- they 
we re comi ng to us that sort of we heard about the 
ma ssacres in other towns. Wa s the people we wo
rked with, someti mes some par -- some people -
- some peasants came to work and they told 
us certain towns there were some  massacres 

[indecipherable] out, you know, likenext town [indecipherable] neighboring towns. So we really 

thought of escapings, you know, but we waiting for 
-- for y -- we had no organized groups to 
escape. So the -- they -- they was -- they came 
when the -- in the spring. It was the -- I don™t 
r e me mb e r  t h e  d a t e s .  Wh a t  I  re me mb e r  it  w a s  
kind of Puri m and peopl
e -- people are -- people 
were really celebrating, you know, as
 quietly, a Purim holiday [indeci
pherable]. The -- the ghetto 
was sort of the we -- the people we
nt out to work and I start to go 
to work with -- they took us to 
one like, pl ace where they collected all the peopl
e, the working people, all the columns. And a 
lot of people worked outside the ghetto, and th
ey put all these people 
[indecipherable] waiting 
for this -- for what, I don™t know. We  waited til 
the ha -- our president, 
our Judenrat president 
appeared and he says that th
e German authorities want some
 200 people for different -- for 
different work in railroad some thing. It was rea
lly lies, but to ma ke it -- it -- it™s prepa -- a 
preparation for some thing else, bu
t -- so they took 200 people, other words, let us go to work. 
We were --those who had to go to work, had to 
go to work and took some  people out of work, 
and at -- at work we found 
out that -- I don™t know, they 
took [indecipherable] I don™t know 
where to, no -- nobody knew where to, but they took 
them a way. They -- they -- yeah, they took

out the s -- they went into the ghetto the same
 time and they took some  children and elderly 
people the same  day, in the morning before they 
went out, we assembled, we got -- we  were out 
there -- out again, the SS called upon 
the -- our president, the Jewish president, the -- to his of -- 
to the office, and they dema nd three thou -- 
4,000 people. Our ghetto had 12,000. Our ghetto -- 
Q: Had 12,000 Jews. 

A: -- had 12,000 Jewish people. 

Q: And they wanted 4,000. 

A: And there -- they want f -- 4,000. 

Q: We  have to stop the tape, I™m sorry. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: You were talking about there we
re 10,000 Jews in the ghetto, or -- 
A: 12. 
Q: Or 12,000, and -- 

A: 12,000. 

Q: -- they we re looking for 4,000. So they were going to kill 4,000? 

A: When they were ready -- the SS, I™m talking -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- was dema nding, they called up 
Mr. Isikson, he was the ch -- th
e head of -- the president of 
the Judenrat, while we in the -- in th
at area together out of the ghetto. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they want the amount of people -- some
 amount of people, they called Isikson and 

dema nd he s hould deliver the kids, the elderl
y, and to ma ke up 4,000 -- they wanted 4,000 
people. They want 4,000 people. And Isikson wa s 
[indecipherable] and he -- he says, you ask me  
for gold, mo ney, I give you. But ma  -- people and th
eir kids, you have to come  and get yourself. 
Q: Because he knew what they were gonna do. 

A: Yeah. So at that time  they figured they
 have to do it, you know, and they gonna do it by 
themselves. So the ghetto was already [indeciphera
ble] the SS, and things like that. They took 
out people -- we were at the -- assemb led outside
 in the place on the 
-- outside the ghetto, the 
working people. 

Q: Right. 

A: So our -- our -- our chef -- th
e head, took out his pe -- a lot 
of people, German and officers 
who had the people working for them ca me  and 
took their people out of work. So those who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
83 
 
 
worked for the German [indecipherable] organi
zations, German [indecipherable] could go to 
work. 

Q: So they were protected in some  way. 

A: They were. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So we go to work, we didn™t know if -- wh
at is going to happen now
. They -- they were 
protected, so there™s -- they want
ed to keep the workers still working, while they take -- and they 
want to take the kids and the 
elderly, a-and to get 4,000 in the fi
rst place, for them. So is -- 
Isikson refused, s-so they let them go home , and 
we, sort of after we heard what™s going on, we 
stayed in the place, we didn't go ho -- go to
 work -- go to -- home after work -- 
Q: You stayed there. 

A: -- the same  day. We didn™t go 
home . And we did hide in our 
-- and rarely you find a place to 
hide, until we ™ll -- the thi
ngs what we heard what™s going on [ind
ecipherable] in the ghetto. So -- 
and towards the evening, we sort of were told 
to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto. 
So we were about 73 people, those who rema ined 
hiding inside, they didn™
t want -- want to go 
[indecipherable] and we didn™t go before, but now they
 want to wait, they said they --  they have 
to go to the ghetto, you had to go 
home . And here we still heard 
the news from -- and we heard 
the guns -- machine guns, that th
ey™re still killing people. So 
there was question, you know, was 
like going to a ghetto, you going righ
t into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were 
afraid to go, but they had to -- they
 had to sort of ma ke sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they 
would say if they could stay here in the -- in 
the pl ace of work another ni ght, would be good. So 
one lady came  into my t a iloring 
room with a gold watch and she 
put the watch down and said -- 
she told me , go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel 
is the head of the -- our 
offi cers, if -- to bribe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
84 
 
 
him, he should let us stay one night more. If th
ey a -- the slaughter will 
go by. So I said -- looked 
at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, beca
use I -- this man never came into me, I 
[indecipherable] he doesn™t know me , cause the othe
rs -- officers work -- came  in for work, he 
never came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you 
do it. I says, that™s the only way out -- she said, 
whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it. 
And I was sitting in [indecipherable] says, she is 
crazy. I me a n, he never -- he never came  -- he 
never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you 

know, it™s -- it™s ridi culous. We ll, waiting, waiting, 
waiting, and there™s no other solution, so the 
pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do?  What can you do?  We ll, I said, 

I™ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever
 is -- if -- if 
I wouldn™t do that, you say, oh, if 
you would have gone, you have -- do -- did some thi
ng, it -- it would have -- it would have been 
some thing. Now, we are really without any he --
 without any help. So I took this watch and I 
walked over, this is one barrack where the o
fficers lived, and I have that [indecipherable] 
everything over there in one bag. I walked over a
nd I -- I la -- never was in this office, never 
went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it
™s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and 
he says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked inand I s -- was -- had to 
stand on the rear door, I 

didn™t move. I just walked in, I didn™t move, 
because his -- this room, the decorations around 
give you a sc -- give you such a scare, all 
this Hackenkreuz is -- banners hanging and the 
[indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and ever
ything all around. Is -- is 
just like Goering or 
something, or some other officer in
 his office in -- in a -- in the b
ack of the room, and in a -- in a 
de -- on the desk. And I says -- so
 -- so he says, well, well, wa
s -- what do I want -- what do you 
want?  Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits
 in a [indecipherable] so
 come here. I walk over 
and I didn™t ask anything, I took out
 the watch and put on the table. 
He says -- I says, look, this is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
85 
 
 
what we have, what one of the ladies have and 
she doesn™t need it, because if we go home  the 
ghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you mi ght use 
it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your 
fa mily, I don™t know whether he was ma rried or not
, never knew. He says to me  in a quiet way, 
he says take it back, I don™t want
 it, I don™t need it. [indecipherable]
 and I le -- I look at him and I 
was -- I don™t see the same  person. He -- he as
ks me  to sit down, and you know wha t  -- what 
happen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forg
et it, he says, take 
it back, and nothing going 
to happen to you. It™s over. In other words, this
 load is over. And nothi
ng is going to happen to 
you, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still h
ear the guns. He says, I 
-- I have or -- I have 
information, he says. So I walk out and -- with th
is news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and 
I told them that we could go ho
me  and nothing is going to happen, it™s over. Meanwhile, we still 
heard the guns, we still heard th
e ma c hine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to 
go soon, at six o™clock we going home. So they said to me , look, we going to go a column with 

people, with 70 people. They don™t 
know who we are or what ev --
 what kind of [indecipherable] 
we have. See -- do some thing, tal-talk to him, s
ee if ma ybe he™ll send somebody to explain to the 
guards, you know. We ll, I said, ma ybe they™re right, but si
nce I saw that he is --
 didn™t -- he -- he 
not, you know, the same  guy is over there. So I we
nt over and I -- again, I 
says that the people 
are afraid to go because they don™
t know where they will -- if th
ey know what we are, who we 
are or some thing like that. And I said, if you woul
d have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as 
I thought -- if you would go with us 
to lu -- I mean, to the gate a
nd te -- explain who we are. So 
he was thinking a few mi nutes. Okay, I™ll go. So he
 got into his car and 
he drove ahead and we 
ma rched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to 
the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it 
was over. At that mo me nt, when we came to th
e gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS. 
Two guys took him and his assistant to their ca
r and put them away -- 
took him away, for good. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
86 
 
 
So that™s why, he did -- he didn™t obey the or
ders. He didn™t give them the 4,000 people. He 
ma de [indecipherable] -- so that™s what it is. I 
me an, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for 
Judenrat, for -- they appointed another guy. 

Q: You -- you said that -- 

A: I been -- we been waiting in -- in fr
ont of the ghet -- gate, to be -- to -- 
Q: To go back in. 

A: -- to go back in. 

Q: And saw -- 

A: But they weren't that fi nished, they didn™t 
clean up -- they didn™t -- til 
they put a --  bore out 
the juden -- the -- Mr. Isikson, and then they opene
d the gates and -- to ge
t -- to let in us, our 
people. My pe -- my group of people. 

Q: Right. How did you know what Isikson had 
said, that he refused?  Is that -- 
A: When I came in the ghetto -- 
Q: People told you? 
A: -- the guy who was the Judenrat ma n, told us.  

Q: That that™s why he was taken. 

A: [indecipherable] a part of the Judenrat, no
t the -- nobody was a -- but he pol -- told us -- he 
told us he wa s -- around the ghetto he was a me mber
 of the Judenrat and he was supposed to be -
- to accomp any the SS when they lo -- loaded th
e people on trucks, out to
 the -- to the shooting 
place. But before, when I left him since -- first 
time , when I went out his door, anothe r officer 
which used to come  into me  with a lot of work
 [indecipherable] well, no f -- more kind of -- he 
obviously used to talk, have a d -- you know, he
 -- he used to come  in mor e  often, and he 
[indecipherable] with me . And he says -- he to
ld me  where I work -- where I been working, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
87 
 
 
know, like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards, a
nd he start -- he™s talking to me  in working, 
that this morning, he says, they took us, all the 
officers, not only us, but officers in the whole 
town who have workers -- officer who work here
, and the -- for the germ -- German officers, 
they took him -- they took them to show the slau
ghter [indecipherable]. They -- they -- the way 
they -- what they -- what they do, they want to sh
ow off how they kill the 
people, and he says -- 
Mr. Lindow, Mr. Lindow says unthinkable, unbeli
evable, he says. What they did, it™s 
unbelievable, unthinkable. How™d th
ey do it?  He probably didn™t wa
nt to go too long with -- 
walk along outside with me , but this few steps he did it, he told me  what  happened. In other 

words they all -- and he -- and he [indecipherabl
e] was along with them. And that probably gave 

him a shock, and he changed. He changed to a degr
ee that was such the co mpletely different. He 
was really -- he was really -- he didn™t know
 what to do. He was -- you know, I couldn™t 
recognize him. You know, he walked around, he didn™
t say a word, he didn™t say to u -- to u -- to 
the others. S- So that was -- his story was -- didn™t
 end yet because soon after, we -- groups -- we 
had a resistance group in the ghetto, and we esca
ped. And with some  ar ms left, we had a nice 
bunker. I build a bunker which is we had some  arms
, the resistance had some  ar ms, and we sort 

of prepared for resistance. And 
since they took us out from t he 
ghetto [indecipherable] resistance 
wasn™t working. 

Q: Couldn't happen. 

A: It couldn™t happen. But when we came bac
k, some of my arms, my bunker wasn™t dis -- 
wasn™t discovered. I mean, they found a lot of bunke
rs and they dis -- confiscated a lot of ar ms , 
which we prepared for the resistance.  

Q: Where did you get arms?  Where did you get weapons from?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
88 
 
 
A: Well, we had y -- you know, y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian 
military. Wh en they gave up, they left in the woods 
and the fields, so they had to collect these, so 

the people from the ghetto worked this -- with this
 comp -- with this group to bring the arms, so 
they smuggled in these arms, from rifles to gr
enades, you know, as much as they could. So I had 

the -- my -- my -- my friend Tanchim was -- was th
e head from my group, we
 had five in a group 
prepared. And our -- we -- since we had a rifle 
and grenades in our -- in our bunker, and our 
bunker was not found. So, in other words, we planne
d an escape and it™s the only arms  we had, 
the others were confiscated. And we prepared
 an escape. We  didn™t know which way, whether 
through the ghetto, cut the g -- cut the barbed wires,
 or from t he place we work, from the airfield 
-- airfield. It took us time to get 
this -- smuggle the arm -- we decided to escape from the airport, 
and so our people were the electricians. Our 
people who were from our resistance group, they 

worked -- they were electricians and they worked 
out in the airfield, further out, and over there at 
the airfield we walked around free.
 We didn™t -- even though we ha
d patches and things like that, 
nobody bothered us. 

Q: But they were -- the electrician
s we re farther away than you were. 
A: What? 

Q: The -- the electricians were
 farther away than you were? 
A: No, no, they were -- 

Q: They were in the same f -- airfield? 

A: The same  airfield, but they were
 in -- into the airfield that  th
ey are almost like further out in 
the [indecipherable] they worked th -- the electrician -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
89 
 
 
A: -- [indecipherable] installations, so they work
ed out further, so we -- they explained that 
there™s some  bushes we could stay there all day lo
ng, go to work and from work, the little -- this 
-- you know, single people could go there to the po
int where we ha -- go together and in the 
evening, we™ll escape with the whole group.  
Q: Now can -- can I ask you some thing? 

A: Huh?  

Q: We re -- were there -- a number of
 resistance groups in the ghetto? 
A: There were what? 

Q: We re there a number of resistance groups in 
the ghetto, not just yours, there were other ones? 
A: There were the other two, yeah. 

Q: There were two more? 

A: Two  

Q: Two mor e? 
A: There were, in general, two resistance groups,separate, you know, but they -- different plans, 
we had different plans. But at this point th
e ghetto was already divi
ded again, smaller and 
[indecipherable] and there -- and 
there was a lot of people -- 
Q: Right. 

A: You know [indecipherable] cause the resistance 
lost a lot of people, even those -- our own 
people. So the other escape was planned for my
 group, plans with our ar
ms [indecipherable] in 
our baseme nt [indecipherable] but still it was on 
the other side, the ghetto was cut off shorter. 
You know, they -- there were less people, th
ey cut -- they cut 
the ghetto shorter. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
90 
 
 
A: So even though there were -- our arms were 
in the other side, behi
nd barbed wire, but we 
ma naged to go through [indecipherable] guys -- the 
guys went over at night [indecipherable] get 
into -- brought into the new ghetto, our arms -- 

Q: So they went over the fence? 

A: Cut the wires. 

Q: They cut the wires? 

A: Cut the wires, and we  watched the gua
rds. The guards were going back and forth. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we want to get these arm back to the pla
ce where worked at the ai
rport -- at the airfield. 
From there we planned to escape. As we -- 

Q: Can I ask you some thing?   

A: Yeah. 

Q: This sounds different from -- 
A: What? 
Q: This -- this kind of
 behavior, for you -- 
A: Yeah? 

Q: -- being in the resistance, seems 
different than what you did before. 

A: Different? 

Q: So what -- what ma de you join the resistance? 

A: What made join the resistance is simply b
ecause you cannot go to the slaughter like sheeps.  
Q: So you wanted to do some thing. 

A: Wa nted [inaudible], and of c
ourse there was no, assurance, you know. Sure, it™s a lost battle, 
but you want to have a resistan
ce, as much as we could do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
91 
 
 
Q: Right.  
A: As much as we could do. A
nd we [indecipherable] arms, thei
r arms are better, but we  knew 
it™s not the same  -- it™s not the sa
me  as -- it™s not a even strugg
le. But we got to do some thing. 

But later on, when it turned out that  we were left
 with a few arms  only, and the -- and most of the 
resist ant people were killed in -- in the ghetto, 
so [indecipherable] there 
we re left, we were 24 
people together, we made the escape.  

Q: And whe n was the escape, do you know? 

A: When the escape? 

Q: About. 

A: About, it was October, some thing like that. 

Q: Wa s it cold, snowy, or -- 

A: Oh, cold, really [indecipherable] was sep -- 
August, it is the end of September, octo -- 

some thing like that. Pr eparation, you know, it was ki
nd of -- til we moved back the arms to the -- 
you know, we got -- you have to 
esca -- the escape has to be 
-- if you™re not arme d you cannot 
escape. I me an, you can escape -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- but to ma ke sure, it™s bette
r -- it™s assurance, if you have
 some thing, it feels -- you feel 
stronger. I know it -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- I know when [indecipherable] and we had the 
hand grenades for the rest of the people, so 
we hand out just the one hand grenade, ma kes yo
u so strong that you feel
 -- you walk differently, 
you have, you know, a little more courage, you -- so
 you -- at least you have some ar -- some -- 
some  resistance. And we [indecipherable] we ma de
 it, we ma de the escape. Later on we sh -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
92 
 
 
got out the arms outside to the airfield over th
ere and we -- the arms were hidden in the bushes 
and then we ma de the escape. We  made 
the gr oup together , little by little -- 
Q: This is 24 pe -- 
A: -- single -- single people. 

Q: -- uh-huh. 

A: Single few people just [indeci
pherable] not going one group, but 
just we knew that we™re in 
the group together, little 
by little and we -- we grouped toge
ther at [indecipherable] you know, 
it™s [indecipherable] now. You know it™
s a little -- in Sept ember -- is it 
-- was it October, or that™s 
-- or something like that , something like -- it wa
s -- the summer was over. And -- and days are -- 
and people -- what the guys who worked there, 
and they came later, told us what -- when we 
were escaped and then the forema n i s  counting us, 
that -- and he reported to -- to the Rudel that  
24 people missing. He says they escaped. So -- so he
 -- s -- that™s what they
 told us, that Rudel 
said, in -- in German, yea h, when they™ll -- We nn 
sie rieten Kennen losen die Laufen. That™s the 
-- when -- when they can save themselves, let them
 -- let them run. So he was the -- he became  a 
different ma n and he chose later, if you want to 
finish his story, his stor
y didn™t end yet, cause 
when we entered -- when we came to the parti -- pa
rtisan --  we me t partisans, Russian partisans, 
they sort of were very anti-Semitic, but they 
[indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no 

arms, you know, you™re not arme d. We had our -- the 
rifles were -- he sai
d, is not -- not enough. 
You cannot fight, he says, with this, you gotta 
get arms . So you gotta send out here -- do 
some thing, you know, he was really pushing us to 
-- to some  point that you couldn't say no, was 
-- so he says, you gotta send out people to get 
arms, or to do some  sabotage work. You couldn™t 
do it if the fe  -- you™re not arme d you can™t a
nything, but anyhow, we -- 
the -- our leaders did 
send out -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
93 
 
 
Q: Can -- can you hold that thought, because we
 have to make a change of the tape. 
A: Okay. 
Q: So the arms, we™ll star t there.  
End of Tape Six 
Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Henry, let me  ask you some thing. This group th
at you are talking about, where they™re saying 
to you you have to go and get arms in order to be able to be in this group, cause you -- you didn't 

come  out wi th enough -- is that the first group you were with? 

A: That was the first group. There was another -- 

Q: Wi  -- how did you know where to
 go?  You leave the ghetto -- 
A: That™s -- that -- it™s in
teresting, you know, and it™s true, 
you know, you™re a -- good question, 
because we didn™t know, we weren't -- we never -- 
we didn™t grow up over there, we were mostly 
more from -- most of the group pr
obably people from -- from Poland -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- on the other side, but some people promise 
they know the law, they know the area, but it 
didn™t work -- it didn™t -- I don™t know if they told
 the truth. They just probably want to go to ca -
- take part in the escape and they promised 
they know. Is -- you know, 
that happened a lot of 
things which are not expected, you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: But we have insi de pe  -- we had now a group pe
ople, intelligent and people that -- we had sa -
- little ma p -- they had some  o -- little ma p, th
ey -- they could [indecipherable]. We ll, this guy 
Muszinski, he was a Polish -- from Poland, also, 
from Czestochowa, and he -- he was electrician, 
good elect -- and he was also very intelligent. He
 sort of l -- looked at the map, little map and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
94 
 
 
could -- could see how to get out, and he was y -- a 
little work here, he coul d see the -- there was 
a railroad, small rail tracks like 
they been carrying woods from 
the woods -- from the woods, all 
wood from t he woods [indecipherable] get to this 
tracks, will be on the right track, in other, will 
go through -- the track goes through the woods. He fi
gured out this here. So that was the -- that 
was the real intelligent judgment in the -- in this case. 
Q: But how do you then find a resist
ance group, the partisans outside?  
A: Well -- 

Q: Was it an accident  that you came upon it? 

A: Accidentally. 

Q: Accid -- 

A: Knew -- we knew wh ere -- we knew as we -- we 
-- we grew closer, we -- as we came  closer to 
the, you know, wooded areas, peasants gi -- you know
, the peasants yi -- more or less gave us 
directions wi  -- where the -- which 
other side -- see, the other side
 the river. See, if you go the 
other side the river, you find them. 

Q: You™ll find them. 

A: And it™s true. It was -- it was the river Sharra
, and if you go the other side the river, we found 
them. 

Q: Now wha t  are you wearing? 

A: What? 

Q: What are you wearing?  It™s cold 
by then, right?  It™s almos t  winter. 
A: [indecipherable] got -- I reme mbe r  what -- wh
at I have. We didn't have very warm clothes. 
Q: You didn™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
95 
 
 
A: I don™t reme mber sh -- well, I don™t re
member  extremely what -- if we have a 
[indecipherable] it was a problem, you know, at th
e mo ment you didn™t think about it. You know 
-- 
Q: Was it cold? 

A: What? 

Q: Was it cold? 

A: It wasn™t  cold yet, no, it wasn™t  cold yet. It was very chi-chilly sometimes at night, but it 

wasn™t cold yet. It wasn™t -- 

Q: And everybody who leaves are men, young boys -- 

A: Is what?  

Q: Men. 

A: Men and wom -- and a few wome n, too. 

Q: Men -- there are a few wome n who -- 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. [indeciphera
ble] wives from - -  from he
re and there -- and -- and -- 
Q: No children? 
A: No, no children. 

Q: But about 24 people? 

A: 24 people in this group. And we had only with
 two rifles. You know, one ri -- was in my 
bunker, and the other one was some one else™s. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: A Russian girls. And, you know, some  ha
nd grenades, because the girls brought hand 
grenades. Where they worked, they sm
uggled hand grenades easier than -- 
Q: I see, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
96 
 
 
A: -- yeah, for the girls to smuggl
e ah -- into th
e ghetto. And -- 
Q: So you find it -- 
A: -- it was some thing like we have some thing 
to do, you know, we had some  resistance with a -- 
whatever we could. It not militari
ly succeed -- a success, we cannot be stronger than they are, 
they are -- they are very -- their arms are -- th
e -- our arms are no match for their arms. But at 
least to --  to be resistant, 
to -- to fight back, no ma tter what
 -- how much you can do was not 
important, you just can fight back. 

Q: That was what was important.  

A: That was important. 

Q: So you folks, the 24 of you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- get to this first group. So who is this
 group, do you even know who they are?  These are 
Russians?  
A: People -- 
Q: These are ru -- yeah. 

A: -- oh, to the ma  -- oh that™s another thi
ng, we don™t know the ot
her -- we don™t know the 
people. 

Q: You don™t know them. 

A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- we didn™t know, you know, we had no contac
t with them. We  had no connection, we had 
no connection and we had no contact before we le
ft . We fi gured, well we™ll -- we™ll -- we™ll fi nd 
someone -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
97 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- with a -- well, that -- when we found them
, they were not good to us, they™re not friendly, 
they were anti-Semitic. 

Q: They were anti-Semitic? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And they knew you were Jewish, of course? 

A: What? 

Q: They knew you were Jewish? 

A: Oh sure, they knew we came together. There wa s one Ukraine guy who was -- he was sort of 

the head of -- not the head, but he was the s -- 
spoke to us in a ma nner like, in other words, why 
did you come here?  You gave the go
ld to -- to the Germans. I n other -- you gave the -- you gave 
th -- you gave the gold to the Germans, and you 
came here, in other words, empty handed. You 
came here --  
Q: Empty ha -- 
A: -- you came  here wha t , to save your life, he 
said. We ll -- and -- but, he says, well you have to 
show that you really want to fight the -- bac
k. Fight the [indecipherable]. You have no arms , so 
you have to go and get arms, and you get what
ever you can sabotage, whatever you can do. So 
ma  -- well, our guys went to start to do some thi
ng, to think about some thing. So we send out four 
different -- four different groups to show -- to go
, as they say -- as they have dema nded, they 
have dema nded to go out to get arms, or to do sabotage. So one guy from our group -- from -- 

who worked at the electricians, 
he said he™ll go back to the 
transforme rs, he™ll destroy the 
transforme rs in the airport. It™s a big sabotag
e [indecipherable] and a
ll the -- to -- young kids, 
they said they worked with -- for a ye -- they
 worked for police, they worked, you know, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
98 
 
 
the ghetto they went out to work to the police,
 railroad police, those who carried the prisoners 
and thing, or my people are [indeci
pherable] to the camps, or those prison -- those have a police 
force, they ha ve a police force and they worked 
for them. So they -- so 
they go and see if they 
could get some  ar ms ove r there. 
And the third one -- th
e third group is just 
to get int -- the 
information to go near the railro
ad, to see the -- bring the info
rmation, the move me nt, what kind 
of -- what kind of move me nt it is, 
what cargo, military or some  that
. So there were fo -- and then 
there™s another group which just simply -- I don™
t know whether you figure to go get some  ar ms. 
And those four -- four guys, you know, they went 
out, they didn™t have arms  with them. They 
weren't armed, but they went to l
ook for arms , which was really -- 
Q: So these are guys going alone? 
A: Huh?  

Q: These are guys going alone 
or in their small groups? 
A: In their s -- no, alone, they -- 
Q: They™re alone? 
A: -- some of them are alone, some of them with small group. 

Q: [indecipherable]. And are you going at all? 

A: No, I -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- not go -- 

Q: You™re staying. 

A: -- they we re going. I [indecipherable] I didn™
t go there. But I was 
[indecipherable] you know, 
to the other one. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
99 
 
 
A: So the others has way -- they ha ve  -- they ha
ve  some  sort of place where they could find it, 
ma ybe they had in the mi nd some wheres to go wh
ere they could find some arms . And those fo-
four guys, those four guys were ki
lled right away, out -- when th
ey stepped -- you know, the first 
-- the first -- they -- the 
German patrol right away killed them
 as soon they went out on the other 
side, the outside of the camps, you know, they 
-- you know, an hour later, some thing like that. 

These four gu -- and the other guy, th
ey went wi -- to -- went to blow up the transforme rs, they 
went -- came -- went back to the pu -- in othe
r words, the pl ace where we were and he was 
spotted -- he was mi x -- mi ggling -- 
mi xing with jig -- the guy still which working there, he was 
play like one of them, a nd then stay overn
ight and do his job. While he was hanging around 

there, a Polish guy knew his -- that he escaped in
 the partisans [indeciphera
ble] worked with the 
Jewish guys and they were talking 
about he -- that Moishe Polak is
 -- is in the partisans. And 
then he sees him here. He sur -- he infor med 
the SS. And they -- they came  and picked him up 
and brought him for interrogation an
d one SS offi cer was sitting next
 [indecipherable] his table, 
and nic -- is sort of asking 
questions. And he had a hand grenade with for -- from our group, the 
guy, he pulled out the hand grenade. So the officer
 saw the hand grenade, he went out the room. 
And he wants to blow hims elf up --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- with the hand grenade, but the hand grenad
e didn™t go off. So he opened the window, and 
just -- he jumped out and killed
 himself jumping out the window. 
Q: Mm. So right away it™s a tragedy, right? 

A: Yeah. Boys cry [indecipherable]
 cry. All the others have also 
su -- they all succeeded, but the 
four guys who were killed the first we
re people who worked in our place.  
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
100 
 
 
A: And they, when they were killed, they had th
eir documents on them, the -- the -- their I.D.™s. 
So they knew where they worked. So went back and they had this, the SS went back to the work 
-- to the place where they worked, and tried to
 find -- to find out how come they don™t know -- 
they didn™t know that they escaped. Sa id, when di
d they escape?  So the -- they -- they went to 
the far [indecipherable] it™s an office where they 
keep their registers and 
the files fr om all the 
workers. And they were looking for the files for 
these guys, and they couldn™t find them. So they 
ask these clerks, is there mi ssing files?  We ll, he 
-- he said that Rudel, 
ma n was here, he took out 
the files, say you don™t know, you know, for what 
reason they too -- took 
out. He took out and 
destroyed them, like we never existed. 

Q: Existed. 

A: So that was -- he didn™t ca
ll -- when we escaped he
 didn™t alarm the SS, that™s one thing. He 
didn™t go to chase us [indecipherabl
e] us -- he was it -- and so, in other words, and then he 
figured that he™ll take out the -- the files, 
nobody will look in -- will -- 
nobody will know that we 
escaped. So meanwhile the SS arrested Rudel and as they -- later on the guys came, they came 

after us, some  of the m ma naged to escape, the la
st --  the last  -- the la
st -- from our -- from 
[indecipherable] we were -- told us about that, ho
w he was arrested and court-ma rtialed. So I felt 
I -- I felt that he [indecipherable] was talking to
 him that he -- he went through a tremendous 
change, being that he was a devoted
 Nazi and could not -- he woul
d not expect that kind of scene 
which is -- you know, it could break down a lot of
 people, but he broke down even though he™s a 
-- he was a devoted Nazi. 

Q: Right. 

A: It broke him down. And you know
 ho ma k -- how much -- how strong they are what it is and 
you know, but you never know is a [indecipherable] a ma n is just a human being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
101 
 
 
[indecipherable] could break down anybody. So that™s 
what the ir -- we heard of these guys who 
came later, what he -- what happened to him,
 and he -- and he was court-ma rtialed and 
presumably -- I don™t know what -- which way, or 
-- it™s hard to find them. 
I then -- go to find -- 
Q: How do you spell his name , do you know? 

A: What? 

Q: How do you spell his name ?  

A: I don™t exactly know, but I l --  

Q: Is it R-u-d-e-l? Or -- 

A: R-u -- R-u-d -- R-u-d-e-l 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And the -- this -- we had still a struggle and 
-- and the others over th
e -- cause this group was 
very anti-Semitic, with -- the ones that were -- ga
ve us orders to go. We  ha d such a -- really, we 
lost so ma ny people right away, the first fr -- ri
ght in the first step, lost two -- two of the good 
people. Two of this and the three [indecipherable]
. And -- and the ma in thing is what -- is where 
they were not instructed how t-to do it, how to
 go. They were strange, you know, and they -- out 
from the woods, they know -- they didn™t know if you can go by a daytime or at night. You 

know, some  of them go dangerous places, you don
™t go in broad daylig
ht, you -- you wait until -- 
til it™s getting dark, or complete night. They were
 not giving instructions at all, they just send 
them out to be killed or some thing like that.  

Q: So what happened in th
at group?  Did you stay there,
 or did you folks leave? 
A: Fa -- we didn™t stay long with them, because 
they were really very 
-- like whole group were 
really -- like how could I say, they -- they told 
us -- they ma  -- called them ex-convicts. I mean, 
you know, like -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
102 
 
 
Q: Ex-convicts?  Did they seem like criminal -- 
A: Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian
 -- the Russians, they 
open the jails you know, 
the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys, killers
. They could kill [indecipherable] even, very 
easy, and -- 

Q: How did they treat the wo
me n who were in the group? 
A: What? 

Q: How did they treat the wome n? 

A: How they treat the wo me n? 

Q: The women -- you are -- the wome n who ca me  with your group. 

A: No, they didn™t bother our wome n, but they had their own. 

Q: They had their own wome n. 

A: Yeah, they had their own wome n. Every [indeci
pherable] is a different
 -- different way of -- 
but, they were horrible. They were horrible and 
their behavior wasn™t good, and their treatme nt. 
They really let [indecipherable] we could not stay
 there longer, but was -- they were robbing us, 
and they robbed our arms, and the shoes, some  
good shoes they took off. People came  from the 

ghetto still when the ghetto was there and they ha
d some thing, some  valuables, s-something, they 
robbed them. 

Q: They took it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Yeah, they weren™t afraid. They always 
took shoes off, they [indecipherable] watches 
[indecipherable] the handgun and som -- so they
 took away. You see, the handgun is only for 
officers. You don™t have to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
103 
 
 
Q: Handguns are only for officers? 
A: Yeah, yeah, only for officers. That™s the excuse. 

Q: I see. 

A: [indecipherable] explain, why did you -- why did 
you take -- you know. Oh th
at -- that -- this 
-- a handgun is only for officers here. 

Q: So tell me , did your group have a leader of some  kind?  

A: Yeah, the -- we have a leader  what -- he couldn™t do much. [i
ndecipherable] have a leaders, 
you have two leaders, you have a co -- a few guys 
which are sort of in the leadership sure. We ll, 
they were st ill in the --  in the ghetto, there we
re leaders, so they -- some of them were still 
leaders in the group. 

Q: So who ma de the decision to l
eave?  All of you together, or -- 

A: To leave to go out? 

Q: To go -- no, to go to another grou
p, you [indecipherable] this first -- 
A: Oh, to go another group later on? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We ll, course it was im
possible to stay there. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So you had to find a -- we found out that ther
e -- another group is comi ng to this area, and -- 
and it™s -- it is an entire different
 area. They came from -- from a Slonim are -- area that™s -- it™s 

another region where the pe -- the German had bi
g, big raids there. A division with mi  -- the 
army diverted to clean -- to -- to clean out thei
r -- their trads -- their 
groups. They were a big 
unit, you know, a big moveme nt -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
104 
 
 
A: -- of different groups, lot of groups. So they
 moved towards us, they were going to go further 
e -- further east. So some  of the groups also sp
lit up. There was a -- a Jewi sh group, what with a 
Russian com -- comma nder, so we figured well 
ma ybe it™s a good -- so we got the idea to go. We 
have to leave anyhow, this area
 is -- couldn™t stay longer. 
Q: Right. 
A: And so we -- we ma naged to me rge with them. And -- 

Q: Is this the one near Sl onim, south of -- 

A: Well -- 

Q: Or is not -- not yet? 

A: Is what?  

Q: The one near Slonim?  Is this -- 

A: Through Slonim, yeah the guys -- the guys from
 Slonim, a nd they came to our area, and of 
course they were in -- 
Q: Ah, they came to your area, uh-huh. 
A: Yeah, they came to our area, cause
 they had the big raids. And y -- 
Q: And was this Orlovsky™s group, or is that another one? 

A: What? 

Q: Is this Orlovsky, or is this another group? 

A: No, this ano -- not yet -- 

Q: Another group. 

A: -- not yet. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
105 
 
 
A: It is not Orlovsky yet. This
 is a group, a -- a group which splinte
r also, they -- they were a big 
brigades and they broke up in the smaller groups
 because they been running from -- they been 
going east, so they couldn™t go in one big brig
ade, there were a few hundred people. So they 
broke up these small groups, and in this one was 
a Jewish group and we -- we -- some  of them 
got together, and we me rged with them. 

Q: And who was the leader of that gr oup? Wa s there a leader? 

A: They had a leader, they have a -- they had a Russian leader. 

Q: A Russian leader? 

A: Yeah. They had a Russian leader, and they fi
gured that was better. And we told the Russian 
leader, you know, where we were th
ere, that the -- these guys befo
re, they -- they killing the -- 
ma ny peopl e come  from ghetto, they been killed
 there -- a lot of peopl
e have been killed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he says why don™t you meet with this 
[indecipherable] we told him that you -- you 
commanding us, why don™t you meet with these guys
, the Gorkinsens and tell them why the -- 
and ask them why did they kill people when they
 come fr om the ghetto?  So he met with this 
commander there, Tsygankov and he says, why do 
you kill th -- all Jewish people, they come 
from the ghetto. So he says, don™t worry, if I™ll 
kill a hundred -- a hundred
 Jews, and one of -- 
and one would have been a spy, I would be f -- I w
ould be justified. That™s 
a -- that™s the answer 
-- 

Q: So that™s [indeci
pherable], right, right. 
A: -- I™ll be justified, you know, that --  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
106 
 
 
A: -- that -- that is really a -- you know, a s
ituation [indecipherable] co
mplain if you have no -- 
nobody to complain. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Yeah, they give you such answers, so much 
re ason now [indecipherable] he brings you a -- a -
- a good reason, kill a spy. But it™s not a spy and not th
e -- not the spy, they just wants to kill the 
Jews -- 

Q: Jews 

A: -- the Jewish -- yeah. 

Q: And this second group was 
better, this gu -- this -- 
A: The one we me rged? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We ll, insi de was better, but y --  we stayed 
there until [i ndecipherable] almost til the end of the 
year, end of -- 
Q: ™42?  
A: ™43.  

Q: End of ™43? 

A: Yeah. We stay with them, and -- but there was 
a big raid, a raid, the ra
id was -- they attacked 
us in the winter. I don™t know which was [indeciphera
ble] the year or that was the end of the year 
-- end of the ™43. 

Q: We re you there with yo -- were 
you with them for about a year? 
A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: It was a -- we me rged with 
them for a couple months later. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
107 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Couple months later there was 
a -- a -- you see, the -- the ma rshes freeze in the winter and so 
they had the -- the lake fr oze, 
so the German gro -- the militia 
what they had -- they had also 
Belarussian militia in ther e, they teamed up w
ith the German SS, and they raided our camp, 

which it was easy to -- to come over because th
e -- the lake wa s frozen in the winter, and 
attacked us. We didn™t have any casualties, but 
we  just escaped, just -- just -- and the trouble 
started then with this -- you c
ouldn't -- and things changed, this -- this Russian commander sort 
of was good, so long, til is -- he took in some  
Rus sian escapees from ca mp , or whom -- who 

were [indecipherable] Russian guys, and they didn™t 
like the way they -- they said the Jews are 
lazy bum -- you know, the Jews are really -- so th
e [indecipherable] so he -- he sort of agitated, 
you know, to be -- you know, h-he wasn™t anti-Semitic before, but he -- what they -- what they 

gave him lessons or something, I don™t know. And 
he changed, he changed, he wasn™t the -- he 
listened to them, the -- get rid of the Jews, get rid of
 the Jews, get a -- since then he decided -- he 
sort of took a group of Jews, small group and try 
to get [indecipherable] 
he don™t want to. So 
[indecipherable] them, he took a -- went east. So he
 l -- he left  us -- he left the group from -- this 

Baranovichi group, probably [indecipherable] th-the
y separated -- they separate us again, cause, 
you know, it™s over. The raids broke the whole thing -- 

Q: Right. 

A: And the -- the -- th-the  -- he was changed, was became also anti-Semitic, yeah, beca use they -

- they told him, they te -- they gave him a lesson. 

Q: Uh-huh. And he learned it. 

A: They gave him a lesson, and again -- 

Q: We  have to stop the tape. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
108 
 
 
A: Yeah? 
Q: Yeah. 
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
109 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Okay, we left off and you said you were le
ft alone, that this -- 
this guy just left you by 
yourselves again, right?  Or you decided to leav
e?  The second group. The second -- the second 
resistance group you were in. 
A: The second, when we me rged with the other group? 

Q: Yes, but then -- then you split from them, right?  Cause this guy, th-the  guy who seemed not to 

be anti-Semitic became anti-Semitic. 

A: Oh, the -- Pugachov. That -- it was some thing th
at -- we went back -- 
we still had a Jewish 
group in existence, I me an, since they went back 
-- they went, they left people and they left the 

gr -- us, and were -- now, who does that?  They ha
ve -- the g -- the group originally, which was a 
s -- was sort of dis mantled because you had a 
raid and people were running in different  
directions, til they grouped t
ogether it took a long time, c
ouple weeks because you spread out 
who knows where, because it was a 
big raid. Took a couple days unt
il they burned the village, 
and took a few days and they were -- we were
 spreading out in the 
depths from the woods 
some wheres. We  didn™t know how fa -- long they sta
y, but they were -- trie
d to go back, but they 
were still stay -- the German forces were thi -- 
still in the vi llage for a few days, you know, that™s 
unheard of -- it was unheard of til 
then, how long they stayed, they
 want to clean up -- clean out 
this area. So -- but this comma
nder of this group Pugachov is a 
Russian guy, and he start ta -- 
taking -- getting in more people like from th
e Russian prisoners -- Russian guys, prisoners, 
escaped pr isoners. And --  and ther e were s -- they 
were anti-Semitic, and they sort  of talked them 

in.  

Q: Right, you had said that.  

A: Yeah, I said -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
110 
 
 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: So to [indecipherable] against 
--  well, it turned out they elim
inate Jewish people because they 
were the ma jority, and -- and they [indecipherabl
e] the things to be there, they had the 
commander, he gave them everything. He was 
like a big -- big comma
nder, do -- do nothing. So 
then there was a -- a call to go 
east, partisans should group east
 wa -- i-in deep -- deeper 
[indecipherable] because they c
ould group together bigger units -- 
bi gger partisan brigades, so 
they, because  the German -- four German battalions were really active in -- in raids, and they 

figure if they th -- if they were
 grouped together, they still be 
stronger resistance 
and they would 
not be able to eliminate these group. So he dela
yed that call til -- delayed until finally after the 
raid, and these two fr -- fre -- c
ouple friends, the Russian escapees 
talked them in and say, he got 
-- he gotta do some thing, in other words, so he left. Half of the group behind it -- he 

[indecipherable] from the old -- his old Jewish fr
iends, the others, and the Russians, guys, and he 
took off east, he left us alone. We  ha d eight -- four 
rifles -- four rifles, very little arms. In other 
words, we were a lot of pe -- we were 36 people,
 some thing. And we tried to stay and ma intain 
whatever we could do, try to get some  contact, 
we couldn™t -- we couldn™
t find any contact with 
any other groups. So we™re by ourselves. But the Go
rkinsens, these were after us. They want to 
get rid of us in that area. They 
don™t want us in this area because 
it™s their -- their area, they say 
it™s thei r territory. 

Q: So the -- the partisan
s want to get rid of you. 
A: Yeah, it™s the Russian -- the Gorkinsens, yeah. 

Q: Or the [indecipherable] 

A: They want to get rid of us and they don™t -- 
they no -- they don™t want us
 at all in that area. 
They says, the -- the Jew, they -- they sort of a-af
raid for their securities, 
not sec -- we are n -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
111 
 
 
are ruining their hi ding pl ace -- their places [indeciphe
rable] it™s just ma  -- excuses. They don™t 
want us in their area. 
Q: Henry, what was your role in the resistance?  
Now that you™ve been in for almost a year, I 
think, what were you doing?   

A: What we were doing? 

Q: No, you. 

A: Me?  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: We ll then, just waiting for good days. 

Q: Just waiting for good days? 

A: Yeah, waiting for the -- because we 
are really -- have nothing to do now. 
Q: No, no, no, before, when you were in these two [indecipherable] group. 

A: Before, y -- there was no -- you know, just pa 
-- come pra -- pa-patrol 
and that™s all, nothing 
much. Patrolling the area was it. Patrol -- 

Q: Uh-huh, and you™re pa trolling what?  You™re pa
trolling to make sure the Germans are not 
there, or  what? 

A: Patrolling is so s -- you know, we been -- as 
we were s -- before, a separate group, we been 
raided. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we -- we had s -- we lost stuff -- we lost
 the camp. They raided camp and we had to leave 
to the other side. So now we have to do it more
 secure they -- around the camp. So we had to 

patrol  around the areas with excess roads, watch 
the ol -- the oncoming [i ndecipherable] or raids 

or some thing. So sort of -- sort of tried to be mo
re careful now, cause we l -- we l -- almost lost 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
112 
 
 
two people, cause they were wounde
d in that raid, in the first raid. So that was my doing now 
with --  
Q: So now -- 

A: I didn™t have -- I didn™t have -- I 
didn™t have ver -- arms of my own. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Just the hand grenades, and therefore it™s --
 those who had arms were more sort of obvi -- 
really, they -- nobody wants to give up 
their -- their arms if they have.  
Q: Right. 

A: Nobody wants to give  it up cause they™re not 
sure if they will ge
t back, like -- but -- 
Q: So what happens now, you™re -- the group 
is alone again. Do you 
find a third group? 
A: So we sitting alone, yes? 

Q: Yes. 

A: And which -- one guy is in comma nd, this -- 
he must be at le -- 
there must be one in 
command otherwise -- 

Q: So who was he, what was his name ?  

A: What? 

Q: What was his name? 

A: What™s his name? 

Q: Mm. Do you reme mb er? 

A: I just remembered yesterday. O
h, it™ll come  to be, because -- 

Q: Okay, sure. 

A: And -- Minek. 

Q: What was it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
113 
 
 
A: Minek. 
Q: Blinnick? 

A: Minek -- m -- 
m- i-n-e-k, Minek. 
Q: Okay. 

A: He was -- sort of had the group. Ni ce guy, and while
 it was cold, we were 
near the -- the river 
was frozen, we were camping near the -- near the 
Sharra river, so our road were -- the appro -- 
the -- the approach to our camp was through the river.
 It was frozen, so it was like a -- was like a 
good road, like a highway. 

Q: Yes, right. 

A: A frozen river was -- it was good --  

Q: It™s a good -- 

A: -- was a good road. 

Q: Yeah, right. 
A: We  could go, we could -- even though we could 
go with -- with -- with th
e horses, with things 
like that, and it was -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- it was frozen good. So we ca mp ed there, but 
soon, in February, sort of
, the river gave -- the 
river was floating -- floating. Youknow, February it start get warm
er, so the warm weather melt 
the ice, the oncomi ng water is fl oating
 -- floating over -- is running over the -- 
Q: Ca mpground -- 

A: What? 

Q: -- where you were? 

A: Is comi ng closer to our camp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
114 
 
 
Q: I see. 
A: Comi ng closer to our camp, we had to evacuate, go some where else . In the first place, it a fo -

- before that happened, we -- there were four othe
rs, they -- they -- we got from -- left for -- for 
us, for this group, the Gorkinsens want -- came  to 
that [indecipherable] and they says lets -- you 
have to go for a certain operation. The arm -- you have
 to s -- give me  -- send all armed me n with 
us, all the -- so we send four guys, we have four
 -- four arms, four guys. And they -- when they 
came to the point where the -- they
 we re introduced [indecipherable
], this is the ma n in -- in 
command of this operation, he says he wants 
to look through the arms, everybody should check 
their arms. So he -- they let them check their arms
, but they never gave back. They rob their arms 
in a nice way, in a nice way, in a tricky way. 
In a tricky way they robbed the arms, and the -- 
when they came  home  without ar
ms , we say that -- that™s the 
end of us. We  have no choice now, 
we -- I don™t know, we have to do some thing. Well,
 it was t -- it was t
ough without arms , we 
couldn™t -- without arms you can
™t -- can™t even get food, you know. So we waited. In 
meanwhile, the -- the -- the river was flowing a
nd the camps a way -- and our camp was sort of 
getting more water and water, you see?  Soon enough, 
we™ll probably -- we™ll 
have to be stuck or 
can™t go further, or we™ll go s-sinking here, be
cause the water is comi ng in fast. So this 

commander, he send out two guys, two in different 
direction -- two in the 
one direction, and me  
and -- I went out with my friend Jonathan in on
e direction to look a wa
y out. If you don™t -- we 
always had the river for the road, but we have to
 find a way to go beside 
the river to get out of 
this area -- of this swamp -- of this swampy area 
or some thing. So I have -- I have been good at 
that, I always have -- went out scouting, and 
I went out with my friend Jonathan and well 
[indecipherable] a couple hours l
ooking around the area, how to ge
t to -- out -- to ma ke a way 
out in a dry way, not -- not into the wa ter, and to
 -- so when the two ot
her guys went a little bit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
115 
 
 
on the different direction, they should look in that 
direction. And I came  back
 to reported this, we 
have a good way out and that™s all, we could simp
 -- not difficult to get out from here. Found still 
a dry way -- dry land to go out. The other two 
guys took a little longer time to come  back. 
Couldn™t ra -- didn™t [indecipherabl
e] whether they got lost or 
some thing [indecipherable]. They 
got lost, they got a little wande
ring around a little bit. They co
uldn™t find it. They came  back -- 
they couldn™t find anything out. They couldn™t 
find a way out. [indecipherable]. As we sitting 
and goo -- discussing the reports of these ex -- 
the evacuation of ours -- camp, two Gor kinsens 
appeared. 
Q: Who?  

A: Gorkin -- the two guys from gor -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and says -- and they said, who the two 
guys who -- who -- yeah, they reported they me t 
once of the -- one guy that me t one of the Gorkin
sens. Okay, it wasn™t so clear, but anyhow they 
said they me t one guy. Okay, so these guys came a
nd they said who are they. Who are they, they 
say. So these two guys raise their 
hands. So they says come  along to
 our commander, he wants to 
co -- ke -- ask you some  questions because he 
wa -- you -- you came over and he wants to know 
why [indecipherable]. Oh, we says, you know why, 
because I -- we wanted have a wa y out and 
we™re looking a way out. Yeah, but to him -- you go
tta explain to him, he wouldn™t take -- come  
along. As they walked out, two mi nutes later, 
two shots. So we -- this [indecipherable] our 
commander said well, tomorrow morning we have to 
go. It™s no -- it™s no use to stay here, it™s no 
good. So we figure, we lost two guys again, and no
 reason. Well, we di -- we sort of made up 
that -- that was the -- towards 
the evening, in the evening. That
 next morning we don™t wait too 
long, early in the morning we get out [indecipherable]. And as we packed our stuff in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
116 
 
 
morning to get out, two guys are he
re [indecipherable] again from 
the m, two other guys and they 
ma ke sure that we -- that we are moving out. 
They watched us going, so they went back to 
[indecipherable]. Going on, we had no place where 
to go, cause everyt hing -- everywhere is 
dangerous. You know, s ort of bei
ng pushed out to the edge, to th
e -- and we could not -- we find 
a place we stayed at -- we  stayed a couple days in
 a place, we says it isn™t temporary -- it isn™ t 
steady, but temporary, wait until we fi nd the pet -- permanent place. But again they showed up, 
more than one, more than two, the whole group. And 
-- and we sort of -- so we had -- we left 
together, we had -- each one had two hand gren
ades. We  had the hand grenades, Russian hand 
grenades. So you had them in the belts here, two hand grenades. So they figured we don™t have 

arms, they finish -- they finish off us. They -- th
ey want to finish -- th
ere was -- they took arms 
and they are alone, without arms . Well, they came
 in, they looked around, see we still have hand 
grenades, I think they changed their mi nd. They
 just, oh, I wa nt to see where you -- where you 
settle -- where you settled. You know, ma de them
self in good friends. Good friends. And they 
left. They saw the -- saw the hand grenades, they
 didn™t want to start 
a war. Anyhow, we went 
further, what you say, again [indecipherable] decide 
it™s not the place to stay, because they will -- 

they™ll be comi ng in here and there. If not t
oday, they will come tomorrow again. So we moved 
further out. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: We move d out to a -- almost to the end of
 the partisan zone, you know, it™s almost -- very 
close to the German patrols, okay?  And over th
ere we stayed a few -- couple days, and it ha -- 
still -- still I saw one or tw
o of the m comi ng -- comi ng nearby. 
Q: What, of the -- 
of this -- from this other group? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
117 
 
 
A: To look a -- to look -- to se -- to find out
 where we -- where we s -- where we -- we camping. 
There was a real tra -- strange th
ing. At the same  time, two our friends, those who were -- went 
out with j -- with the Pu
gachov, they broke up with them and they came back cause had t -- they 
have girlfriends here, in us. So they had two 
rifles, each one had two guns -- they have  two guns. 
[indecipherable] we were happy to see them, cause 
with -- with two guns, at least we can defend 
ourselves, you know. It™s -- and then
 we could get some  food, also. 
Q: So why did they come  back?  Becaus
e they had girlfriends in your group? 
A: Yeah. That™s th -- it wasn™t 
very well organized where they le
ft, but -- with Pugachov, so he 
was not commander any more, and they were
 sort of dispersed 
in different groups. 
Q: I see. 

A: I think they were not -- they 
didn™t control where we is. They le
ft and they came to us -- their 
girls. So we gonna have sitting 
this [indecipherable] situation 
if we get -- we has to be -- 
some thing has to be done, you know, we cannot just keep running -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- there™s no place where to go. So these [indeci
pherabl e] bring their two guns, so they go out 
into a village, to look for some
 contact with the other partisan
 groups, and ma ybe they would get 
some  help. They came -- when they came back 
they said they me t some  two guys, which are 
from the joka -- from the -- two guys -- they me
t in the village two guys and they listened 
carefully what they told them, and the two guys sa
id, well it™s a very seri
ous ma tter that si -- but 
we didn™t [indecipherable] we don™
t believe it [indecipherable] they
 would say, right away we™ll 
solve the problem, said we™ll try, we™ll br ing th
is new me ssage to our comma nder and we™ll see 

what he could do it, cause he is -- he is this 
-- he is a powerful ma n, he could do it. And it didn™t 
take long, the next day in the morning we saw th
ese two guys, these same guys came  back to our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
118 
 
 
-- our camp, where we camped, and -- and they sai
d, we told our boss and he was very upset, he 
heard what happened with -- he -- he know the Gork
insens, he know this -- what they are, and he 
says from now on I™ll -- he™ll be 
taking care of that. He says he™ll -- he™ll protect it from now on, 
because you are under my control. Couldn™t be li
eve it what they saw. Sure enough, this was a 
powerful ma n, probably has the power to 
-- to give orders, the other -- 
Q: Right. 

A: And he says he came, explained that the -- we
™ll take care, and we™ll set up we™ll disperse -- 
he™ll take our people and put them in Russian groups, he says, according the Russian law or 

some thing -- the Soviet law, no Yiddish -- Jewi
sh groups alone, I mean for  itself is illegal 
otherwise. If you be in a -- in 
the -- in the groups [i ndecipherab
le] with Russians with protection 
-- with my protection, he says, he™
ll -- they™ll -- they can™t say a
nything. He start doing it. He was 
a ma n who could do it, he has the power -- he had the power. 

Q: And wha t  was his name ?  
A: What? 
Q: What was his -- 

A: Orlovsky. 

Q: It was Orlovsky. 

A: Orlovsky was the very 
-- Orlovsky was a fighter -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- in the [indecipherable]. It is shu

[indecipherable] where there was --
 he teamed up with a -- but Orl
ovsky was just landed, he th -- 
he came -- he -- they parachu -- he parachut
ed with a group, a small group. And he met the 
Jewish partisans from Sl onim which were [indeci
pherable] after a raid, and they also had a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
119 
 
 
couldn™t find together, they always were in --
 split up. And this guy, they would -- that the -- 
Liker, his name  was Nathan Liker, and he says 
-- he explained to him as Nathan Liker saved his 
life. This Orlovsky, when I me t -- Nathan Like
r was -- came from [indecipherable] and he met 
Orlovsky, and he found -- Nathan Liker found out from
 a -- from the other people -- the peasants, 
that the high commissioner is comi ng -- the high 
commissioner is comi ng to hunt pigs, wild pigs. 
So they -- that Nathan Liker was happy to see -- see what now Orlovsky save orlos -- so he came  

to Orlovsky for help if -- if th
ey want to attack this expediti
on, the hunting is 
-- so Orlovsky was 
very happy and Orlovsky took his 
people, he came and so together
 -- they got together 15 people 
and attacked -- and ambushed the expe dition. Of c
ourse there was success, but Orlovsky at the 
end almost -- he got -- had a -- a Russian -- 
they threw a Russian dynami  -- dynamite pieces. The 
explosive. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They had dozen explosives bi
g as a brick, a small brick, and he
 -- you know, like our bricks in 
the shape of this, but a little smaller. This br
ick has, if you put the fuse in, you can throw and 
explode it. So he been throwing these bricks up at 
them, at the -- at the hunters. And of course he 
was successful, but the -- the last one he picked
 up, a bullet hit this br
ick and it expl oded -- 
Q: Exploded. 

A: -- in hi s face. This man was compl etely -- I me an, he -- he finished th
at his own way. His arm 

was gone, the other arm was half 
off and Nathan Liker saw this 
happen, he grabbed him to carry 
out from the fire zone. And Orlovsky begged him 
and say, drop me , because go back to the fight, 
I™m not going to ma ke it anyhow, so you don™
t have to bother with me . And -- 

Q: We  have to stop the tape there, I™m 
afraid. You have to tell the end of -- 
End of Tape Eight

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: Go ahead. 
A: Okay then. 

Q: So you were talking about 
this incident in Wor l d Wa r 
11
, when Orlovsky was -- had a horrible 
accident  and this Jewish ma n, Nathan Like
r was going -- taking him to save him?  

A: He had -- yeah, he -- by throwi
ng this grenade, this fire bomb -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- he was terribly wounded. One arm was complete
ly off, the other just the hand up to here.  
Q: It was off. 

A: Off. His face burned, and we saw -- I saw 
him later, you know, when he had recovered 
already. 

Q: Right. 

A: Face was unrecognizable, he was a -- all burned
 and with kind of wou
nds, and his whole face 
was like -- and -- but the only thing is -- is -- hi
s legs are good, his feet were good, the legs were 
good. He could run -- I could not catch up with hi
m, you know, he™s so fa
st and he -- and his 
mi nd was good. And his -- and he was really a -- stil
l a fighter, still couldn
™t sit still, you know, 
to get people into action, to sh
 -- all kind of -- and he
 agreed to take some  people from us, not 
only to -- to -- to -- to dissolve the Jewish -- 
Jewish group as a whole, and to set them up in 
different [indecipherable] in non-
Jewish or [indecipherable]. And 
he did some thing and he took 

some people into his [indecipherable] becau
se [indecipherable] and I got into his 
[indecipherable] in his group and he was really 
a remarkable person, very -- so smart and -- but 
could not sit still, he wants to
 fight, even though without arms, 
he had his [indecipherable] his 
friend, his Spanish -- a Spanish guy who dressed hi
m or fed him, and whenever in pub -- never -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
121 
 
 
nobody see, he always, some where where nobody™s ar
ound, he was fed and did other things, you 
know, but away from -- from other eye -- from other people. 
Q: [indecipherable] Right. 

A: And whe n he gave orders still, he was in 
command, he di dn™t want to
 give up the job, the post 
th -- of this group. And he was sort
 of respected in the area as a pow
erful ma n, he had his hi -- he 
has [indecipherable] Liker, what he
 wrote, is then colon -- a col
onel or some thing in the army. I 
don™t know what kind of rank it is. 
It isn™t important what he was 
-- he was really so down to 
earth, sitting down with -- with the Jewish guy, si
tting [indecipherable] he took him in in the 

evening, he had a fireplace, and te
lling stories and all kind of storie
s, his -- and -- and he -- he™s 
telling also about the Liker, he says he savedhis life, he -- Nathan Liker saved my life. And you 

know, he -- he does the -- I can™t
 -- he says, I [indecipherable] 
do -- I™m doing this for Jewish 
people because see Jewish -- a Jewish guy saved my
 life, the Jewish people saved my life. And 
he was really good. He had restored order, all th
e Jewish troops who were around that area were 
never harassed or touched, cause he gave a orde
r they™ll be responsible if they do something. 
And nobody since then -- 

Q: Did anything. 

A: -- did anything to Jewish 
groups or some thing like that. 
Q: And so when -- when did you get into that group, in ™44? 

A: From beginning of ™44, yeah.

A: -- eventually I did and after when the armi es -- when the Soviet armi es came towards us, I 
went back to Baranovich. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What was that like when the Russian army came?  Did you feel liberated? 

A: We ll, I didn™t -- you know, to tell you the trut

by without the -- without the -- 
it went so fast through -- 
Q: But you knew, once they went through that you were okay. 

A: When they went through we -- we figured
 -- we  knew they™re cle -- nearby, they comi ng 
towards the -- they going into the -- but we fi gured
 we™ll be --  we™ll hear them or something. 
Q: But you didn™t. 
A: But the vehicles went by, you know, not that fa r fr
om the road, but they were so quiet, and the 
American -- American trucks, they were quiet, th
ey not ma king that noise. And -- and we didn™t 
hear them. 
Q: So how did you know that it was 
okay to go back to Baranovich? 
A: Oh, well, in a day or so when people cam
e -- people came over and some of the m are our 
people. So that was -- I 
went back to Baranovich. 
Q: It must have been difficult though, no? 

A: Yes, it was very difficult. First of all they --
 they come back to ci 
-- their ci ties were all 
bombed and you know, and also burned down to 
the ground. The demolition of -- a -- retreated

a front line, and he -- he says w
ithin three days they were all dr
essed and into the front line, the 
very front line. 

Q: Really?

eady to go back to Poland -- to Lódz when the 

armi es were -- we figured the armi es go fast, so

125 
 
 
my friend, the other one who is also from Lódz
, we tried to move out
 towards Lódz. We  got 
stuck in Bialystok because the armi es -- the Soviet armi es didn™t go furthe r because there were 
this uprising in Wa rsaw, a Polish uprising. The 
Polish uprising took place and it was a political 
ma neuver, political case, you know. The far right 
Polish -- Polish underground forces organized -
- they organized the uprising, and they have tol 
-- tell -- told all the -- 
all the people it™s a pure 
uprising. Really, they want to
 s -- they want to have -- 
get the power in Poland --  
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: -- before the Soviets -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- come . They could have a bargaining with 
them or some t hing for independent country or 
not. I mean that -- ma ybe that™s what the reason, 
they -- they start the uprising too, before the 
Soviet™s army will enter, and the Soviets did no
t enter because they figured why -- I don™t know, 
I mean, to me, it™s wi -- they figured why should th
ey give us conditions that
 th -- that the germ -
- I mean, the German will take care, let them -- 
let them -- they will fi ght the Germans all the 
way. They didn™t -- the Soviet™s army didn™t ente
r til -- til the s -- the uprising were cr ushed -- 
Q: Right [indecipherable] right. 

A: -- completely. I™m sure that that -- this 
was the lot problem whic
h everybody knew about it, 
the situation that time there when they moved 
towards -- and they went across the Vistula -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the Polish river. They stayed at the Polis
h river and they didn™t move. And we we re behi --

126 
 
 
Q: I see. 
A: We  were there -- 

Q: So you were waiting? 

A: We  waited to go back to Lódz and here it take s -- took a long time because the uprising took 

the time . 

Q: Right. 

A: And they didn™t go straight right through, beca
use there we re other fronts open. This front 

was not open. They were in the northern -- up northe

 people went on -- to the othe

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
128 
 
 
A: Innoc -- innocent name  --  
Q: -- a very difficult time, because on the one ha
nd you™re glad it™s over and glad you™re seeing 
your brother, but -- 

A: Yeah, well, it™s te
r -- it™s very dif -- 
Q: -- it™s -- it was -- it was difficult. 

A: -- yeah, difficult, difficult to go [indeciphera
bl e] searching for pe
ople, for my fa mi ly, 
survivors of the family. I found th
e -- the -- my mother™s fami ly 
-- my mother™s brother with the 
fa mily, survived in a village, not in our area, not
 in Lódz area, in the -- quite a long way in the 
kel -- Kielce area. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he survived with the family, with [indecipherable] with kids, small kids. 

Q: Really? 

A: [indecipherable] how they survived. They h
eard -- they heard -- when [indecipherable] they 
looking for the hiding place, couldn™t find a place 
where to hi de, and they were -- they were 
called to report for -- for deportation. So they be
en -- they were looking for a hidi ng pl ace, and 
peasants, nothing -- they didn't want to take them
 in, they were afraid, or
 so mething like that. So 
they went sitting in the fields, 
the rye and the wheat, along the wh
eat. And over there they been -
- they been spending summer almos t  there in th
e -- in the fields. But then, on a Sunday they 
heard the voices, the people -- the 
peasants came  to look about when 
it™s ripe to harvest. So they 
si -- they heard them say that next week they
™ll be -- that was on a Sunday, that tomo rrow they 
will come to start the -- to take up --  take off the 
harvest, so they had to run away before they -- 
so they went into a pl ace, just looking for place,
 couldn™t find it. There wa
s a little wooded area, 
they dug a hole. They dug a hole and all of them 
went into the hole and they put a hiding cover

out on top. And they [indecipherable] of my uncle 
was a ma n, he had a -- ma de the upper parts of 
the shoes to a Polish guy, and -- and before the wa r,
 so he reme mbered that he lived not far from 
the -- in that area, so he knocke
d at the door, his door at night a
nd he told them they hiding and 
he asked for food. 
Q: Mm. 

A: This guy, for about six or seven months, br
ought food every night to
 their hiding place. 
Q: Wow. Did they remain in Poland, 
that family, or did they leave? 
A: No, th-they left -- they left the [indeciphe
rable] they all came -- they all went to ger -- 
Germany was -- DP camps -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- was the only good place where to, you know, 
stay, you don™t have -- you know, because in 
Poland, when we came back to Lódz, there were
 no -- nobody take -- took care at people who 
came from camps -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- or from partisans or from war -- or ho-
homeless pe -- when we came was [indecipherable] 
cause the German -- German population lived there,
 and they left. So we had apartments, we 
came early in January, it was different. 

Q: Right. 

A: But when the people from ca mps c a me , and it 
was towards spring, towa rds the end of the war, 
there were no -- 

Q: No place to stay. 

A: -- no place where to stay, and they -- and there 
was no kitchen for them to feed them, or publ -
- you know, public pl ace where to sleep -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
130 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- or some thing. They were just like homeless people. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They had no -- so they went back to Germany 
to DP camps where they -- at least they be -- 
they™re being fed and they had help. Some  sicks 
people -- sick people get help and -- and they 
had clothes and so on. In Poland the governme nt
 didn™t give a -- a damn, you know, they didn™t 
do anything to help these people,
 which unless some one had c onn
ection, which could go to -- if 
some body has connection to go then, to have help -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- so they went some  to the ho -- the people 
in camps, some of them went to hospitals. But 
other than that, to have a place wher
e to go to sleep, 
a place to live -- 
Q: They didn™t have it. 

A: No. So ma -- 
Q: So you met your -- did you meet
 your future wife in Lódz? 
A: I me t her in -- nots in Lódz, but a s -- differe
nt town. Yes, my wife was  -- came from ca mp, or 
a different camp, to look for her fami ly and she 
me t my uncle, which they were sort of related. 
My wife™s -- ma -- my wife™s father was a cous
in to this aunt who me t -- ma rried my uncle -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- so she stayed with them for the time being 
and when I went to see them, I me t my wife over 
there. She just came from camp. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And being that she -- her name  wa s Gerszono
wicz and the other people
 were not related, but 
they also have the same  name , and -- and they talked
 her into stay, so that we stay with her -- this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512

fa mily, and my uncle came , and I came to look on 
my uncle, and I found out -- and I went to -- I 
wrote a letter to a Polish fa mily which lived ne
arby my uncle in the vill
age and sure enough I got 
an answer from my uncle, I was su
rprised that they survived, a
nd I rushed to go to see them. 
Q: Mm. 
A: It was a long t -- and ta -- 
I mean, just a long way to go. 
Q: Right. 

A: Long trip and I came with the 
train where from there had to -- 
had to go with a small train or 
with a -- whatever [indecipherable]
 place, and I got off the train a
nd I s -- met a Jewish girl. She 
looked at me  -- in this little town, and she l
ooked at me , said, I don™t know you. I™m - -  I™m from 
here, are you from this town?  I said no. I came 
to look my uncle. She says, where are you going, 
where™s your uncle? I says, he is in [i ndeciph
erable]. Oh, don™t go there. There was a pogrom 
last night and they -- all Jewish
 people -- the survivor
s, Jewish people [indecipherable] ran away 
in different places. She said, I don
™t know where they -- where they
 are. Finally, took me a -- a 
day to go -- go different parts 
and different places to fi
nd my uncle and his fa mily. 
Q: And you found hi m?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. When did you go to
 ber -- Bergen-Belsen? 
A: Bergen-Belsen?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: At the end of ™45.  

Q: And why did you go there?  You just 
not -- you couldn™t stay in Poland? 
A: In Poland -- in Poland was that time  ve
ry bad. The pogroms were all over. Even though in 
Lódz there were some victims, pogroms. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512  
132 
 
 
Q: Really? 
A: There™s no future -- he could -- it™s a 
Communist rule, you can™t 
go -- you can™t leave the 
country. If you stay there, even
 though you don™t want to wor -- li
ve in this -- in the country 
where it was chaos and you don™t know whether the 
-- they say the por -- the Soviets wouldn™t 
stay, it™s okay, you know, they pro -- a lot of pe
ople promised good things. They said the Soviets 
will leave, it™ll be back Pola
nd. I -- I didn't believe it -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and it was so, because they didn™t leave.
 So, if the Soviets st
ay -- you know, they don™t 
want to go, they want to stay there. So e-ev
erybody who ca me, even they came from lo -- they 
start comi ng from the Soviet Union, people whos
e -- who stayed there through the war, they 
didn™t want  to stay in Poland because the Soviet
s are -- the Sovi ets are over there and you cannot 
-- you don™t want to -- you know, it™s 
a -- it™s -- it™s a state which, y-
you run away from that. It™s 
ironic, they came from Siberia, 
th -- and they escaped from the 
Siberia [indecipherable] and they 
-- now they say whoever it could ma de -- took off 
and got further into Germany -- into Germany 
where they had DP ca mps, at least in a place wh
ere th -- at least lay down and have foo -- enough 
food to eat not to be hungry again, you know, whatev
er food it was, but it was food to s -- to s -- 
to survive until each one found some body else or so
mething like that, from the camps or that 
fa mily out in the different countries 
or some thing like that, and they -- 
Q: Why -- why did you choose to go to Bergen
-Belsen rather than any other DP camp? 
A: Accidentally. 

Q: Accidentally, uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, because we -- I, and -- we ma de the 
escape to the -- from Poland, and we landed and 

we came to Berlin. In Berlin that time  they we
re talking they should -- we should leave Berlin, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0512

the Jewish community, the Jewish institutions th
ere, because they gonna be -- they gonna block 
off -- they gonna be -- 
Q: Blockade? 

A: -- a blockade. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the blockade, so it™s gonna ne -- we don™t 
know it, they said the [indecipherable] had to 
be done, now how -- if you gonna be able to -- to
 fi -- the supply -- to supply the su --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- th-the help. So we went 
further -- we were across the border, ac ross -- we [indeci pherabl e] 
the border to -- and entered Brit
ish zone. The British zone, no pl
ans where to go, but we -- but 
the first town was Hanover, it™s the city of Ha
nover, we came for help because we were -- were 
wandering around for a couple days, really hungr
y and -- and -- and tired. So the guy, this 
committee said look, you got -- you™re here, we had 
-- we don™t have the f
acilities, we don™t have 
the place where to put you. Bergen
-Belsen is not fa r from here. 
Q: Right. 

A: They™ll ha ve plenty of -- they have  place where to put you, you can have  a -- you rest up and 

then you can go where you want. 

Q: Right.  

A: So well, we went to rest up, but the -- some how
 we stayed for the -- for years, because we had 

some  friends over there to begin with and we wa
ited, waited for e migration, for this and that -- 
Q: Right.

So we got stuck. So they say it™s now -- Belgiu

to come  in, no more. So we got stuck in Be
