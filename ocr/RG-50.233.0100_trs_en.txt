 
 
Interview with Miki Pear 
June 12, 1992 
Wa shington, D.C. 
 

Q: Today is June 12, 1992.  I am here with Mrs. Mi
ki Pear of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and she 
is here at the United St ates Memorial Holo
caust Museum today to tell her story of the 
Holocaust.  Good afternoon.  
 

A: I was born inWa rsaw, Poland on May 14, 1935.  My
 father was a violinist and a professor of 
music.  My mother came from a very large family -- my father was an only child as far as I 

know.  He had a tiny family.  My mother came  from an enormous and very well known fa mily 

inWarsaw, a very prominent family.  My 
grandfather had a soda, carbonated beverage 
ma nufacturing fa mily.   
 

Q: On your mother ™s side? 

 

A: My mother ™s side.  I don™t  know very much a
bout my father ™s side.  I know only that he came 
from a fa mi l y of intellectuals, professors, lingu
ists and I don™t know what
 all.  I do remember 
his parents.  I reme mber meeting them once.  
I reme mber going to their home, I reme mber the 
room that I was in.  I reme mber that there 
was a red oriental rug, 
very highly patterned, 
intricately pa tterned and the walls were line
d with books..That was very impressive because 
first of all, I had never seen a
nything quite like it and second of a
ll because my father ™s parents, 
like my father, were very short.They were even 
much shorter than my fa ther was.  I reme mber 
that --the room so clearly because I reme mb
er thinking how do they reach those books which 
went so high up. The ceilings in Europe were
 very high and I don™t reme mber and I was very 
small. 
 

Q: We re you crawling on the rug? 

 

A: No, I was walking on the rug.  I 
had to be four years at that 
point.  I reme mber thinking how 
could my grandfather who was so pale and delic
ate looking climb? There were ladders on each 
side of the room, which I guess must have been 
on wheels or however those things worked.  But 
I reme mber imagining how could my grandfat
her who looked so frail and tiny reach those 
books. That™s the impression that I have of my
 grandparents and I reme mb er absolutely nothing 
else about them nor do I know anything about them
.  Only that my father was an only child.  
However, my mother ™s side of the family, I reme
mber very clearly. And they were exactly the 
opposite in every conceivable way. They were ve
ry loud and noisy and gregarious.  My mother 
was the youngest of eight siblings. There were 
nine originally, one died at a young age, ma ybe 
in childhood, I really don™t  know.  But she was on
e of five daughters, she was the youngest, and 
three sons. The oldest child was a daughter, th
e oldest child, my mother ™s sister, ma rried a 
physician who was her childhood sweetheart and they
 moved to Russia. This would have to 
have been in the twenties. They had 
two daughters who I know became -- one became a 
me rchant ship captain, captain of a me rchant sh
ip and the other daughter, this would have been 
my cousin, became, I believe, a physician.  But that
 entire part of the family was lost to the 
other, to the rest of the family because 
they were in Russia.  So I know nothing – 
 

Q: Sovietcitizens? 

 
A: --Soviet exactly.  So I don™t know any more a
bout them but I imagine that these two cousins, 
anyway, who would probably be twenty or thirty 
years older than I am, mi ght still be living.  I 
imagine my cousin is a sea captain, provocative 
thought.  Hopefully their descendents are living 
some where in Russia and hopefully they™re enjoying 
a peaceful  life.The rest of the brothers and 
sisters -- all the sisters married 
and all of my mot her ™s  sisters, 
all four of my mother ™s sisters 
had fa milies of three or more children. And all of those fa milies peri shed.  Of the three 

brothers, the oldest was banished 
to Siberia with his wife and ch
ild.  He survived the war and it 
was he who later found me  where  I was hidden in
 the Ukraine, where I survived. The other 
two brothers -- the mi ddle brother escaped sometime during the firstWorldWar and the story 

goes that he was, what™s  th
e word?  – He punched a senior in the jaw for some  reason. 
 

Q: This is in the Russian army? 

 

A: In the Polish army.  He was in the Polish cava
lry. The Polish cavalry during the firstWorldWa r 
was kind of interesting because if you could afford 
your own boots, or at least this is what I am 
told, if you could afford a fancy uniform with
 boots and so forth, you sort of automa tically 
became an officer.  If you could afford to bring your own horse, you became  an officer in the 

cavalry.  So he was a horsema n and he had the mean
s to afford all this grand stuff.  So he was 
an officer in the Polish cavalry.  He was quite 
rebellious and kind of a 
smart ass and apparently 
he got into some , I don™t know, fracas, and punche d 
out a senior officer and they were going to 

shoot him for insubordination.  He jumped over 
the wall, I don™t know, I ma y be romanticizing 
this. These are facts that I wa
s told and eventually escaped and ma de his way toAmerica where 
there was some  distant relative who took him 
under his wing.  Morris Berliner, this middle 
uncle became in later years, the rich uncle inAm
erica.  He™s  the one that we came  to, he was 
our sponsor in the United St ates. The youngest of
 my three uncles who was just the next sibling 
to my mother, my mother was the younger and he 
was next; he was Martin Berliner.  He and his 
bride -- he was a student  in Pari
s -- he went to college there 
and became an engineer.  He and 
his new bride were fortunate enough to have come
 to the United St ates in 1939 on the last ship 
which was admitted into NewYork harbor.  So he was a surprise to us when we arrive d here 

because we had no idea of his whereabouts at all. 
 

Q: You had known hi m before you left? 

 

A: Possibly.  I don™t remember him at all. 

 

Q: Hard to keep track of all your uncles? 

 

A: We ll. yeah. Also he was in Paris.  He  was a 
student in Paris. Although he was very close with 
my mother because they were closest in age, 
I di dn™t  know him.  Or if I knew him, it would 
have been only very casually, very briefly.  
But my uncle Jacob, the oldest was closest in the 
family to my mother. The two were each other ™
s confidant, they were friends. They were 
friends, socially. They just had a very close 
friendship even though they were a number of -- 
quite a number of years apart, perhaps fifteen ye
ars apart. And he was her protector and he 
loved her a lot. 
 

Q: He had rema ined inWa rsaw? 

 

A: Ye s, he remained inWa rsaw and he rema ined in my grandfather ™s business.  He ran the finances 

of the business and apparently one 
of the reasons that he was so -- 
that he did that is because he 
was so honest and so trustworthy and so forth. 
 He was the kind of the controller and the 
business head of the business.  My grandfather 
wa s part inventor, entrep
reneur and dreame r and 
my grandfather – For example, my grandfather 
was the first to introduce fresh fruit juice or 
syrup to carbonated water. That juice was ra
spberry and he wa s at the beginning of creating 
fruit flavored soft drinks, spar
kling soft drinks. The fledglin
g company which he called Fraise, 
the French word for raspberries because that was 
the first fruit flavoring that he experime nted 
with, with his carbonated water. 
 

Q: Did you get to drink any? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber at all.  I don™t reme mber th
at at all.  But I reme
mber that life at my 
grandparent™s  kind of revolved around the siphons.
  I reme mb er their home -- I have wonderful 
me mories of my grandparents™ home and here come
s the lump in my throat.  My grandparents™ 
home  was sort of on the outskirts ofWa rsaw.  My uncle Martin, the youngest of the brothers, 

was interviewed for a book, ‚Voices of the Holocaust™ 
and I believe, in that 
interview is the -- if 
not the address, the location of, you know.  I™m 
not very good with the names and the places 
because I was so young.  But that information is
 known. And apparently my grandfather, who 
was extremely tall, unusually tall, he was the tallest me mber of the entire fa mily.  My 

grandmother was quite small and she had beautifu
l blue eyes, she was the only one with blue 
eyes.  She had a beautiful singing voice which coul
d have been operatic but she preferred just to 
share her singing talents with he
r family.  She was the family songbird.  She sang all the time as 
she cooked and so forth.  My grandfather was ex
tremely, highly respected in the community.  
He was sort of the unoffi cial 
Jewish ma yor of the area and wa
s the – He was the one who kind 
of communi cated with the official governme nt a
nd the gentile community.  He was the -- I can™t 
think of the word. We ll, anyway Œ 
 

Q: Communityleader. 

 

A: Yes, exactly. Well, more than that , he was al
so kind of the wise ma n.  People came to him for 
advice and he settles disputes.  He loaned peopl
e money.  He was very loved and respected. 
 

Q: An elder statesma n. 

 

A: He was truly that and looked 
the part too.  He was a great big tall ma n with a white beard.  Oh, 
and I have a wonderful photograph of them too, i f
 your archives mi ght be interested, of my 
grandfather and grandmother.
  Oh, G___,They™re gorgeous! 
 

Q: Wa s your family orthodox? 

 

A: I believe my  grandparents were – 

 

Q: On your mother ™s side? 

 

A: Ye s, I know really nothing about my father ™s
 side.  Everything I™ve to
ld you is everything I 
know and there is no more.  But my -- I think 
my grandparents were probably orthodox .  I 
don™t know that but I think so.  My grandmother 
also has a wonderful reputation.  She took the 
teachings of theTorah rather lite
rally in some  respects.  Every Friday and on every holiday, she 
would go and collect beggars from the street and 
she would feed them in her kitchen.  On the 

high holy days, she invited them to share our ho
liday meal in our dining room. I reme mber my 
grandmother ™s dining which because  she had eight 
children, all of whom were ma rried and had 
children of their own; the tabl
e could seat I don™t  know how ma ny peopl e, ma ybe twenty.  I 
reme mber the beautiful crystal chandelier which 
hung over it.  I reme mbe r  a little story of a  
peasant from the Ukraine who came to work as 
a sort of ma id, or I don™t know, helper, and my 
grandmother told this servant to go and turn out 
the light in the dining room. When the servant 
didn™t reappear for a long time, my grandmother 
went to search and found this peasant standing 
on top of the table trying to blow 
out the electric lights in the cha
ndelier.   So I reme mber little 
antidot al fact s like that .  St op me from telling you 
these st ories because  it will take me forever. 
 

Q: What kind of home  did you live in? 

 

A: We ll my father was a teacher.  He taught at one 
of the universities.  I really am not sure which, 
either the University ofWa rsaw -- there were tw
o universities, I believe.  I think he mi ght have 
taught in the smaller of the two because there wa
s great anti-Se mitism at that time and difficulty 
within the university system.  So he mi ght not 
have taught in theWa rsaw University but I™m not 
really sure.  In any case, he also
 gave private lessons at home.  
My father was not successful in 
the field of ma king money.  He was kind of a 
disappointme nt and disgr
ace within the fa mily 
because my mother ™s family was all very aggressive and very well to do.  Everybody did 

exceedingl y well and apparently they thought that
 that was very important and everyone was 
talented in a different way but ev
eryone was sort of well off.  My
 mother was not.  It was very 
disappointing to the family that my mother ma
rried my father because she married him on the 
rebound.  She had been in love with a local boy 
who apparently was a great Zi onist and gave 
her the choice of -- or asked her to
 go with him to build Palestine. When she refused to leave 
the family nest and go to such a faraway place, 
he  left without her.  I™ve often wondered which 
hero in the St ate of Israel mi ght have b
een my mother ™s childh
ood sweetheart and so I 
roma nticize about that. Anyway on the rebound my
 mother ma rried one f her teachers.  My 
father was quite a bit ol der than my mother and it was against my mother ™s family™s wishes that  

she rebelliously ma rried hi
m.  I was their only child. 
 

Q: How long had they been ma rried before you were born? 

 

A: We ll, I don™t know.  My mother was very young so
 I imagine they were just married a a short 
time and I was thei r fi rst child.  
In 1939 when I was four, I reme
mber with great clar ity, the 
blitzkrieg.  I me ntioned that my grandparents liv
ed on the outskirts ofWa
rsaw in a section, the 
name  of whi c h I don™t reme mber. And we lived, my
 mother and father and I, in an apartment 
that I can describe to you in 
detail, the apartment building and, 
in fact, a little bit of our 
apartment too, but I won™t.  In any case -- well, I™ll describe only this much. That it wa s a red 

brick building and was built with a courtyar d insi
de but I think a lot of buildings in Europe 
were. That there were iron gates through which 
you entered the courtyard. The gate, the handle 
of the gate was a monkey™s paw.  I don™t even 
know though if that™s  al
l that unusual.  But I 
reme mber that clearly and I reme mbe r  that 
gypsies came and entertained and there was a gypsy 
wagon. The people leaned out of the windows a
nd looked down into the courtyard and threw 
coins down.  I reme mber that very well. Th
e circus troupe came and I reme mber that.  I 
reme mber looking out of the window and I reme mb
er that a line was strung from window to 
window.  I looked out of the window one morning 
and a ballerina was walking on a rope, right 
in front of my window.   
 

Q: Across the courtyard? 

 
A: Across the courtyard.  I reme mber that she he
ld an umbrella and she smiled at me.  I looked 
down and there was a bear standing on its hind le
gs and clowns.  It™s  such a clear memory, you 
know. 
 

Q: A visiting circus?  

 

A: A visiting circus in the courtyard. And the 
people threw down coins and that™s  how they were 
paid, these itinerant entertainers. 
 

Q: Do you remember whether this was 
a Jewish neighborhood or was it mi xed? 
 

A: I don™t know, I really don™t .  I wouldn™t  know.  
In any case. I do reme mber that there was a 
trolley. We  t ook a trolley to my grandparent™s  house. The trolley, there was a kind of circle.  

The trolley was turned on a -- like a lazy susa
n. And that -- that was the end of the line. 
 

Q: Then the terminal was near you? 

 

A: That was where we lived, at th
e end of this trolley line. We we
nt all the way to the other end of 
the trolley line where there was another turn-a-ro
und. Within a walk from there was where my 
grandparents lived.  So I could probably look on an
 old ma p ofWa rsaw a nd identify where both 
dwellings we re. 
 

Q: I have one such ma p downstairs. 

 

A: Youdo? 
 
Q: We ™ll look this up after ---. 

 

A: Really? 

 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: I™d like that. 

 

Q: During the br eak. 

 

A: Thank you.  Oh dear, ----- 

 

Q: We ™re talking about your apartment – 

 

A: Well, I won™t go into detail bout the apartment.  It
™s not really all that critical. What I reme mber 
was that very hurriedly getti
ng out of it with a lot of bundles and having a –..  My father, I 
must tell you, my early me mories 
of my father are incredibly warm
.  My father never raised his 
voice.  My father would play with me  on the floo
r with toys and ma ke -- he was very artistic, 
apparently and very creative.  
We played with different colored clay which we made animals 
and whatever, you know.  My father would spend hours in play with me  whereas my mother 

was always busy.  She was always baking a
nd cooking and sewing and knitting and doing all 
sorts of -- she was always busy.  She was al
ways going in and out a
nd comi ng and shopping and 

going.  My father spent a lot of time at home, 
probably waiting for stude
nts or doing -- ma rking 
papers or whatever he did.  In any case, I reme mber that he and I spent a lot of time in my 
childhood.  I reme mber my fourth birthday.  I re
me mber about it that my father had decorated 
the entire house with streamers that he  had 
ma de into– He had cut different colored shiny 
paper, very shiny paper of different colors and 
he ma de chain by gluing loops of varied colors.  
He decorated the room, I guess it was, with these paper chains which hung from the ceiling in 

loops and around the walls and so forth. I reme mb
er that, I don™t know, 20 children or whatever 
of my age came and they all br ought presents. I 
ha d a hysterical fit beca
use I had received two 
sets of domi nos and I lay on the floor and ki
cked and had a tantrum.
  How wonderful and 
understanding my father was and how i mpatie
nt and annoyed with the whole nonsense, my 
mother was.  So my mot her was a kind of dow
n t o business personality, probably like I am.  
And my father was soft and sort of a dreamer.  It
 fits -- the memory that I have of him -- fits 
with the family version of what he was, whic
h they sort of feel was sort of a failure.  
 

Q: Anidealist? 

 

A: An idealist or whatever and an intellectua
l, he spoke ma ny languages, among them Ger man, 
with great fluency.  He was a poet, he read a
nd wrote poetry and so on and so forth.  He was an 
intellect ual.  My mother was more of an earth mo ther. 
 

Q: What languages were spoken in your home? 

 

A: We  spoke Polish, a very intellectual Polish.  
Everyone was very well educated.  My mother ™s  
brothers and sisters were all very involved in the 
arts.  Each one had a different interest .  One in 

theater, another one in opera and another one in, 
oh, I don™t know this and that, whatever.All of 
the guests and friends and so forth and their individual circles of frie
nds were all, you know, 
fa mous. They were all celebrity sort of people in
 the arts. At parties,
 they were all well known 
-- they were sort of
 the jet set of -- yo
u know, of t he time. 
 

Q: We re you old enough to get any le
ssons from your father or–? 
 

A: No, no.  I was not.  I was four years old.  I wa
s not.  I just reme mber sitting on the floor and 
drawing or ma king, playing with clay.  I re
me mber cooking with my mother, baking.  My 
mother -- I reme mber the cookies she baked.  I th
ink they™re called Linser
 tarts or tortes or 
some thing like that. They™re little round -- they
 were ma de little round c
ookies with some jelly 
and then a second cookie with a hole in it on top. That was one she ma de a lot. Then she ma de 

a cookie which a friend of my father ™s who vi
sited quite frequently, I believe he was a 
professor, Professor Zuckerma n, whi c h means su
gar ma n. These were cookies with coarse 
sugar sprinkled on top and my mother used to ca
ll them -- because this gentleman particularly 
enjoyed those cookies -- so she called those 
Zuckerma n cookies.  I reme mb er making those 
with her.  I reme mber sitting --
 preparations in my grandmothe
r ™s kitchen for the holidays.  I 
reme mber my mother and her sisters and 
my grandmother all baking and cooking and I 
reme mber the challahs that they ma de. These 
great long challahs braide
d with a little braid on 
top. They always ma de a little one for me  or they
 gave me dough to play with.  I remember that 
they sat me  in a high chair kind of across the 
-- from, you know, the opposite side of the room 
from where the ovens we re, the heat was. To 
entertain me , they would say, Mirka, open your 

mouth. They would fling a raisin across the 
room and I loved raisin
s and I would open my 
mouth and try to catch the raisi
n. There were great peals of laughter when it hit my nose or 
never reached near or whatever it was.  I just reme
mber that with such clarity, it™s  incredible and 

I was four years old. Then I recal
l that we left  our apartment in 
great haste, schlepping all sorts 
of bundles.  I reme mber a big hysterical fight with
 my mother because I insisted on br inging my 
favorite possession which was an enormous teddy b
ear, almo st my own si ze.  It was a Stief 
teddy bear and my grandmother had bought this te
ddy bear on the day I was born and gave it to 
my mother.  I grew up with this teddy bear and he was my companion and I reme mber that I 

called that teddy bear by my grandfather ™s name  
which was David. And that teddy bear had to 
go with me .We  left the apartment and I don™t reme mber by what means we got there.  I doubt 

that it was the trolley.  I don™t reme mber that 
part but we arrived in 
my grandparents™ home 
where there was enormo us exciteme nt in the co
urtyard, the factory, the house and the people 
who worked in the factory a
ll lived in surrounding
 little bungalows on their land. There was 
enormous e xciteme nt, people being loaded into tr
ucks and also into the horse drawn carts which 

had been used to deliver the soda all over 
Poland and probably all over, I don™t know, Eastern 
Europe.  Everybody was getting into trucks and 
there were sirens and the light was fading.  
Then I reme mber being pushed up into the back 
of an open truck.  I reme mber my uncle being 
told to drive and orders being ye
lled at my father -- I just re
member the entire scene and I–  
 

Q: Did you have David with you? 

 

A: I had David and I sat on my mother ™s lap.  I re
me mber my mother put he
r hands -- I sat in her 
lap with my back against her breast.  My moth
er put her hands in front of my face trying to 

shield my eyes and I tore at her fingers trying to
 get a view of this incr edible thing that  was 
going on.  Huge explosions of li
ght streaking across the sky and 
fireballs and explosions and 
noise and whistling and screaming! And th
e horses screaming and 
automobiles horns and 
people screaming and bundles flyi ng! All this ma de exciteme nt and then we moved out in a 

caravan and joined a -- did you ever see ants fo
llowing in a trail ma king a road?  We ll, that™s  
how we were -- like a river of huma nity in car
ts and horses, on foot 
and screaming and it got 
darker and darker. And then behind the skyline of
 the city, fires and explosions and that™s how 

we leftWa rsaw and life as I knew it, ended. 
 

Q: You had no idea why or who or what was going on? 

 

A: Probably not.  Could we take a 
br eak?  I need a gl ass of water. 

 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: – people who take care of the horses and there 
were people who worked in the factory. Then 
there were these cabins on the land where the work
ers lived and whole families lived there.  My 

grandfather sort of took care of 
all these people and these people 
were all peasants.  Most of 
them came from the Ukr aine. They came and they
 lived there and they worked and then they 
would go home and some relatives would be sent  
back and so forth.Whole fa milies lived fr om 
my grandfather and his– But my grandfather wa
s very involved with his horses and his big 
dream was to have a team of horses -- you know the Clydesdale horses that, you know, deliver 

the beer, I™ve forgotten. 
 

Q: Budweiser? 

 

A? Budweiser beer. We ll these were teams of hor
ses like that.  I mean they weren™t Clydesdales 
with the feathered feet but they
 were just teams of big brown– 
 

Q: Belgian type horses. 
 

A: Right and they were all dark, 
big dark horses.  But my grandfather ™s dream was to have at least 
one team of all white horses.  I reme mber that
 -- and my grandfather 
fought this new fangled 
business of using trucks.  He was enamored of
 his horses and the idea of the horses and having 
the white team of horses.  He bought -- he ke
pt buying white horses and each time he had a 
failure. The horse would get sick and die or br
eak a leg or whatever happened and he could 
never quite collect a team 
of horses.  I reme mbe r  an incident before the blitzkrieg.  He had just 
bought a new white horse, a stallion, I don™t know, 
whatever.  He was very proud of this huge 
white horse.  I reme mbe r  being shown this horse
 along with my mother and father.  My uncle 
Jacob who was the, I,  told you before, the olde
st and he was the controller, was very proud of 
this horse.  My grandfather led th
e horse out of the stable and in
to the central courtyard of his 
doma in and walked the horse around.  He said to
 Jacob, here you take th
e horse or whatever it 
was. Anyway the horse -- and I reme mber this a
nd it™s a very important story a little later in my 

life -- the horse reared up and ki
cked my uncle Jacob in the ch
est.  He bucked, you know, with 
his hind foot, he hit uncle Jacob in the ches
t and knocked uncle Jac
ob unconscious. They 
carried uncle Jacob into the house.  I reme mber
 that back room through which we would go -- it 
was in the back of the house and faced the cour tyard. The front of the house where we lived 

was a little more for mal.  But you see, the soda
 ma nufacturing plant wa
s in the back and the 
courtyard was all earth, no concrete.  So when it 
rained, it was sort of mu
ddy. Also inside the 
soda ma nufactory, it was all water.  So the pl
ant was -- had boards na
iled together, you know, 
wooden–. 
 

Q: Planks. 

 

A: Planks so that the water c
ould go through and underneath. Allthe workers wore wooden shoes, 
you know, like the Dutch shoes.  So they would leave their shoes at home and everybody had 

sort of a little mud room and they would put 
on wooden shoes and then go into the ma nufactory, 
you know, through the courtyard and into the ma
nufactory and work. Then, when they came 
home , they would leave those wooden shoes in 
the mud rooms and put on their shoes or boots 
or whatever they had. We ll, our mud room wa
s -- my grandmother ™s mud room -- was this big 
room and it had hooks on the wall on which coats hung and then sort of shelves underneath that 

where the wooden shoes sat when they weren™t 
in use or the boots, you know. There was a 
leather sort of a bed.  It wasn™t
 a sofa, it was like a flat low thing.  I guess they must have sat 
there to put on their boots.  So when my uncle 
Jacob was kicked by the horse, they carried him 
into this mu d room and they put him on th
is leather sofa bed 
or whatever it was– 
 

Q: Acot. 

 

A: A cot, yeah, I guess, cot. We ll, it was more el
egant than a cot.  It was a big upholstered thing. 
 

Q: It was leather. 

 

A: But it was leather, yeah.  It wa
s dark leather, brown leather.  I 
mean I re me mber that thing. You 
know I reme mber the squeak of th
e hinge of that back door.  I can
 hear it in my me mory. The 
room where I slept when I stayed at my gra
ndmother ™s must have been above or somewhere 
near that door.  Because I reme mber it openi ng a
nd closing in the morning when my grandfather 
went into the factory and my gr
andmother went out to get the chickens or whatever it was. 
 

Q: You spent a lot of time with your grandparents? 
 

A: Ye s, and I loved being there. And I guess because my parents worked, you know.  My mother 
must have worked and my father, I don™t know --
 I must have spent a lot of time there and I 
liked it. 
 

Q: Did you love horses? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber.  I really don™t reme mber any interaction with horses. 

 

Q: So everyone else is more 
excited about horses than you? 
 

A: We ll, I reme mber being awed, but you know–. I reme mber spending my time with the cooking 
and that sort of thing, in the kitchen sort of
 and around my aunts.  I reme mber being in the 
factory.  My grandfather must 
have taken me there.  I reme mb
er sitting behind their house on 
big barrels.  He had big barrels 
which must have contained some thi
ng to do with the soda plant.  
I don™t know, whatever fruit or, I don™t know, whatever
 it was. We  would s
it there on the barrels 
in the sun.That part of the house faced south. 
 In the afternoon, the sun was there.  My 
grandfather and I would sit there an
d he would tell me  stories.  I reme mbe r  one day, he gave me  
Hanukkah gelt.  I reme mber he was explaining to
 me  about Ha nukkah gelt and I just reme mber 
him giving me  coins and sitting in the sun 
and talking about Hanukkah gelt while inside 
wonderful things were being cooked and deliciou
s smells were comi ng out of the windows and 
across the courtyard. Anyway, ge
tting back to the story of my uncle Jacob being kicked by the 
horse, I remember -- oh now -- uncle Jacob, becaus
e he was the controller, he wasn™t  really 
involved in the factory nor the stables.  He was 
in the office so he didn™t wear wooden shoes or 
boots.  He wore shoes with laces, you know, like 
a businessman.  So when he went out into the 
courtyard, it must have been a m
uddy situation because he was wearing his shoes. Wh en they 
brought him in and laid him on the couch, I 
reme mber, while they were all running around 
excitedly calling for doctors and what should we
 do?  You undo his belt and you get cold water 
to put on his forehead and blah, blah.  My 
aunts and everybody was quite hysterical.  I 
reme mber untying his shoelaces.  I don™t know w
hy I reme mb er doing that but that™s what I did 
while they were all -- they were undoing him and 
I undid hi s shoelaces. Years later, when uncle 
Jacob found me, he -- well shall I te
ll you about it later or shall I te
ll it now?   He said to me , do 
you know me?   I said of course I know you.  He 
said but you were so little when you saw me  
last, how do you know me?   I said we
ll I reme mbe r  you perfectly and then I told him this story.  
He was amazed because he figured out that I coul
dn™t have been three.  I must have been like 
two and a half when this happened because he 
knew when it was before the blitzkrieg because 
that was probably the last time he saw me ..  So I 
had to have been less than three years old.  He 
found it so amazing that my me mory was so clear 
and that he reme mbered that and how much 
he had loved me because I was the only -- I 
was the youngest of his nieces and was the only 
child of his fa vorite baby sister.  So I was very 
special and that act of taking off his shoes was 
very special for him and the fact 
that I reme mber that with such
 clarity meant a great deal to 
him.  But I™ll get back to that 
period later. The next couple of 
years of my life are very fuzzy.  
The fa mily all stayed together for a very brief 
period of time and then my grandparents insisted 
on returning toWarsaw. 
 
Q: So you actually leftWa rsaw? 

 

A: Ye s, the entire family and all the workers a
nd everyone who lived there.  Everybody -- we went 

in the truck because we -- the family went in 
the truck.  But everyone else was given the cars 
and carts and horses. Take what --run for your 
lives -- take --save your
selves.  Everybody got n 
the road, we all got on the road and, I 
guess, dispersed on the road, I don™t know. 
 
Q: Your fa mily rema ined together? You were in two open trucks? 

 

A: Ye s, the family was together in two open truc
ks. We  stayed together.  I don™t know where we 
went.  I don™t know. We  left the city. 
 

Q: Do you have any idea whether 
it was a short distance or a..? 
 

A: I really honestly -- I don™t know.  I mean I™m su
re I went to sleep and I don™t know and hours or 
years could have elapsed– I rea
lly can™t  tell you, I™m very fuzzy
 there.  I only know -- I only 
reme mber isolated instances.  I don™t reme mber hi
story, I reme mber antidotal sort of things. 
 

Q: We re you in a city or --? 

 

A: I don™t know, I don™t know. We  were in cities.  
I know we we re in cities. I reme mber, as I said, 
antidotal incidents.  I™ll tell you ju
st a few and that mi ght help.  I 
reme mb er that -- I know that 
my mother ™s fa mily were very close, as I have
 already indicated. Appa
rently my grandparents 
decided that they wanted to die inWarsaw in
 their home  and they insisted on going back.  I 
know that some  of the sisters went back with
 them.  I don™t know where Jacob and his fa mily 
went or wound up and I learned late
r that he refused to sign the 
communist whatever -- he had 
to pledge -- and therefore he wa
s banished to Siberia. The y
oungest brother, as I told you, was 
in Paris so he™s out of the picture. Where th
e aunts all went, the four
 -- well one was in Russia 
with her family so the other thr
ee, I don™t know. They mi ght have
 all returned toWa rsaw with 
my grandparents.  I know there was another branch
 of the family in Pinsk.  I know we went to 
Pinsk, oh that helps, right?  We  went to Pinsk. 
 

Q: That™s  the Russian occupied part of Poland. 

 

A: That™s  the direction we -- oh thank you. You™re 
helping me  too.  So that is where we went -- to 
Pinsk. That™s  where we must have gone.  I don™
t know if we went ther
e immediately or what.  
Then I reme mber that my parents had furious ar
gume nts because my mother wanted to go back. 
 

Q: ToWa rsaw? 

 

A: To her parents, to her family, you know. They had horrible fi ghts and didn™t get along very 
well.  I reme mber screaming and whatever. Th
en we probably left Poland because I reme mber 
an incident where one night I 
heard my mother crying and my 
parents were arguing and I came 
out of bed. There was a fireplace, you 
know, mos t  ________ was the central heating most 
places in Europe.  My parents were burning Poli
sh money; they were burning the bills.  My 
mother was crying because she was lame nting all th
e sacrifices that she had ma de to save this 
money.  My father was telling her instead, foreve
r the romantic, look at th
e beautiful colors of 
the flames.  Don™t think about what it is.  
There is no paper in the world that burns as 
beautifully as that.  Look at it, look how it sparkl
es.  Look, come  here Mirka.  Sit by the fire and 
watch.  Isn™t that beautiful?  You™ll never see anyt
hing like this again as long as you live and of 
course I never have seen anyone burn money, pa
rticularly Polish money.  I reme mber, oh my 
G___, I remember being with my parents once in so
me  other city. We  wer e  in a community of 

people and my mother -- we were on the edge of a fo
rest.  It was a city on the edge of a forest.  
My mother knew about mushrooms. You know in
 Europe there are wild mushrooms, wild 
mushrooms are picked, there was mu ch more intere
st in mushrooms that we have in the United 
St ates and there was a great deal to know about them because some  of them are poisonous and 
whatever. We ll, my mother apparently was 
a mushroom ma ven. A group was organized to go 
to the forest  on a picnic and mushroom picki
ng expedition.  Several families went in a horse 
drawn carriage and we drove to the edge of 
the woods -- or ma ybe two carriages, I don™t  

reme mber.  But anyway, we got to the edge of
 the woods and there wa
s a little boy about my 
age and we had a picnic on bla
nkets at the edge of the woods
, a clearing in the woods, very 
sunny and pretty, clearing and grass. We  had this l
ovely picnic. Then my mother told this little 
boy, you keep an eye on her.  He was a little older.
 You take care of her and we™re going into 
the woods. Don™t worry, we™ll be back, you stay here
 and play right here. 
 Don™t go further than 
this spot or whatever she told him. And he
 and I began to play and run around. We  got to 
bushes suddenly, big bushy things an
d I said to him, look those ar
e berries, they
™re raspberries, 
I™m sorry, blueberries, you know, blueberries.  He 
said, yes. There were 
several kinds of berries 
growing and we began to pick these berries and ea
t them and stuff our mouths with them.  I had 
on a dress with a pinafore or apron or some thi
ng and I took the skirt a
nd ma de a sort of pouch 
and held it in one hand and put the berries into 
my apron.  He began to pull the berries off the 
bush and he climbed up and we had my apron filled when we heard some  noise.  Suddenly all 

the adults came  flying out of the forest and I 
was so excited to show 
my mother what I had 
found.  My mother started to scream, come  it™s ra
ining and she took the berries and put them in 
something and she just --  there wasn™t  time to 
be excited.  My mother was impatient. I already 
told you that. 
 

Q: Practicalwoma n. 

 
A: Practical, yes. She said come , it™s raining, it™s 
beginning to rain. We  started to go towa rd the --
where our carriage, cart, horse cart
 was, and we began to walk in a line. The adults held up the 
blankets over our heads -- ma de like a ceiling of
 blankets. The little boy and I and there were 
several other children who were older and who had gone into the woods with the mushroom 
pickers. We  were among their feet, you know, undern
eath the blankets. Th
e taller adults held 
the blankets aloft over us on the four corners. 
 Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to 

fall. With that, two airplanes came flying out of 
the sky and strafed us and began to shoot. We  
scattered. They made a pass and my  mother sa
id, I reme mbe r  my mother screaming something 

like the blankets wouldn™t
 protect us from bullets, scatter. 
We  began to scatter and I wound up 
in a ditch. When the exciteme nt of the planes
 and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended, 
the little boy who had been picking berries with 
me  was lying dead next to me .  So that™s an 
anecdote. 
 

Q: And you still didn™t know why or what or who? 

 

A: No, I knew.  I did understand. You know, it™s li
ke nobody ever explained the facts of life to me , 
nobody ever had a sex talk with me  but I knew. 
 Nobody ever explained the war to me, but I 
knew.  I was old before my time and understood w
ithout explanation.  I d
on™t think I ever asked 
a question.  I reme mber men disappearing.  I reme
mber the gathering of jewelry to pay some  
kind of ransom.  Somebody was imprisoned -- Zu
ckerma n! Dr., Professor Zuckerma n, we had 
to– My mo ther gave some jewelry and we colle
cted jewelry because he was detained. We  
never did get him back. I reme mber that.  Shortl
y after that, my father went foraging for food 
some where and he was in a farmer ™s field. They went to steal food from a  far m at night.  I 

reme mber my father coming back and saying that
 the soldiers were running -- were chasing 
them and that he hid in a furrow, you know–. 
 

Q: Irrigationditch? 

 

A: Or some thing, I don™t know, in a furrow on the farm between the rows of whatever was 
growing. And that a soldier stepped on the brim 
of his cap and very soon after that, my father 
disappeared and my mother said th
at he had left and th
at he would send for us.  My mother and 
I were left  alone.  I remember asking my moth
er, many, many times, when will father  co me for 
us or send for us.  She always answered in exactly
 the same  way.  It™s 
really one of the half 
dozen Polish words that I reme mber.  She always
 said, Crusscoov and that means soon.  But of 
course, he never came. Then my mother and I m
oved to another city and I wish to G___ I could 
tell you where.  But that city was in the Ukraine. 
 

Q: So you never returned toWa rsaw? 

 

A: No, no, we never returned toWa rsaw.  Oh, I 
reme mber, another incident.  My parents and I 
were on a train and the train was bombed.  Severa
l of the cars fell down into a ditch and there 
were ma ny dead and screaming and G____ knows what. 
We  were in the last
 car of the train and 
I think that was the only one that 
was left standing on the track a
nd was not hit.  So I reme mber 
that. Anyway my mother and I were alone 
and we  wound up in this city, probably in the 
Ukraine, and very near the village where I wa
s ultimately to be hidden.  My mother supported 
us, it™s a terrible word.  I mean she provided 
the little we had by knitt
ing.  I know that sounds 
ridiculous but my mother would take your old 
sweater with the holesin the elbows and she 
would rip out the yarn and out of
 that torn, holey sweater, she w
ould ma ke you a vest or a short 
sleeve sweater or whatever it was.  She knitt
ed day and night.  I reme mbe r  listening to my 
mother ™s  knitting needles, even in the night. 
 My mother smoked.  I reme mber seeing her 
cigarette in the dark.  My mother was an ex
ceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark 
without having to look.  I reme mber going into bo
mb shelters during air raids and my mother 
would say to me , I™m here, just
 listen to my needles and you k
now I™m her e . You needn™t be 
afraid as long as you hear my needles.  If 
she wasn™t  knitting, she was smoking.  She™d say, 
watch, that™s my cigarette.  I would watch her 
face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her 
cigarette.  But most of the time she was knitting. 
 She knitted all the time .  She would ask me  to 
hold out my hands. When she ripped a sweater
, she would wind the yarn around my hands. My 
two outstretched hands. Then she would wind it 
into a ball from my hands.   I reme mber 
holding out my hands and getting very tired and 
co mplaining a great deal
 but that was how she 
supported us.  I know that at night, she would sn
eak out after the curfew and she would go to 
the parts of the city where she wasn™t allowed 
to go be, to deliver her goods.  One time she took 
me  with her. That was rare, usually she left
 me  back in our room with my teddy bear, my 

David, my treasured possession.  She took me  with 
her into the city and 
she said she wa s taking 
me  to a lady who, I must be very careful and 
I must not speak only to say please and thank you 
and to be very polite, other than that to not sp
eak.  If I™m asked a question only to say yes and 

no and not to say anything.  Because where we 
were going wa s very dangerous but this was a 
very generous lady and she woul
d probably serve tea and cake or
 cookies. That was why my 
mother was going to take  a chance and take me  
because we mi ght get some thing very delicious 
to eat, or jam, jam.  So we went and we cro
ssed into a section that 
I don™t reme mber by what 
means or what but I know we were
n™t allowed o be there. We  we
nt into a house and I just seem 
to reme mber that it was a white house and it had a 
door. We  went inside and inside was a very 
cozy home, a cozy room with lovely upholstered 
furniture and a lot of pillows. There was a 

piano and it had a shawl over it and a beautif
ul vase filled with fl owers. There were 
photographs and there were a lot of pictures and 
paintings and things on the walls. We  sat on an 
upholstered, lovely carved settee with a table in 
front.  Just as my mother had predicted, this 
lady brought out a tray with a t
ea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful 
things.  I ate and oh it wa s so wonderful. 
 

Q: You hadn™t had anything like that in a while? 

 

A: I hadn™t had anything like that, 
my G___! Oh, it was so wonderful. With that the lady said to 
my mother, come  into my bedroom a nd I™ll show 
you what I ma de.  It turned out that this lady 
was a -- well she did beautiful needlework. She 
did these pictures which we re framed which 
were both embroidered and appliquéd.  For exam
ple, there was one -- well I™ll tell you about 
that one because it almost caused our death. Al
so the reason she called my mother into another 
room is because this lady also made dolls whic
h we re fully clothed adult dolls but they were 
apparently anatomically correct.  So she showed th
is lovely doll but then 
invited my mother into 
this next room so that she could undress this ma
le doll and show my mother that it had all its 

anatomical parts. Well, while my mother and 
this lady were out of the room I turned and 

looked at the wall behind me  on which hung a pict
ure that this woma n had also ma de. The 
picture was of a sort of cottage 
and a yard filled with chickens
 and there were flowers against 
the cottage and there were little 
windows with shutters and a door 
and so forth. There was a girl 
throwing feed from an apron, just like I had desc
ribed before, throwing seed out to chickens.  
There were chickens all over, feeding and 
flying around and whatever. All of this was 
appliquéd and embroidered and so on and very in
tricate.  Suddenly I realized to my horror or 
fascination that the girl feeding the chickens ha
d a yellow st ar on her chest. When my mother 
came out of the other room with 
this lady, I absolutely coul dn™t 
help but point it out.  Look she 
has a yellow star. With that this woma n flew 
into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and 
said, you did that, it wasn™t  there before, you™re 
responsible, you did that!  She screamed out of 
the door for the police.  My mother and I ran 
out. There were two police and I can™t  tell you 
what they were but I think they had brown–. 
 

Q: Brownuniforms?  

 

A: Brown uniforms. That™s -- I th
ink -- my me mory serves me  -- they were brown.  One blew a 
whistle and ran around the corner fo
r the truck or whatever it was.
 The other one had a rifle or 
a gun or some thing, I don™t reme mber, and he wa
s holding on to my moth
er.  I realized the 
import of what was happening and I began to scr
eam and I bit the hand of this policeman.  He 
began -- pulled away his hand in
 pain and screamed out.  My 
mother grabbed me  and we ran 
and hid and we got away. At that time, my moth
er and I shared a room with another lady in a 
sort of a boarding house which must have been 
all Jews.  I don™t know 
whether the woma n who 
owned this home  was Jewish or not,  I only re
member that she -- I reme mber a lot about her 

actually.  One of the things that
 I reme mber is that she kept talking about her son who was in 
the army and who was going to come  home.  She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked 

and she had it in packages under a cabinet.  She s
howed us that she had baked this and she was 
saving it for her son, it was hi
s favorite thing. As soon as sh
e knew where he was, she would 
send it to the front, send some  to the front.  But if
 that wasn™t  possible that was okay, because he 
would be home soon and then she would have this 
for him.  M y mother and the lady who shared 
the room with us gave each 
other a knowing sort of look a
nd then my mother, every night, 

proceeded to steal some  of the cookies. 
 

Q: Was this an Ukrainian wo man? 
 

A:  I don™t know.  One day, my mother went out
 and she came home  very, very excited, very 
happy. At that time  we were 
literally starving. There was noth
ing to eat.  It was summer and 
we were eating, it™s a weed that grows.  It™s  kind 
of a jagged leaf and it has a kind of gray, silky, 
shiny surface.  It grows here in
 the United St ates and every year 
is a ritual, I eat some .  It kind 
of tastes like spinach. That™s what we ate that
 summer, that and the stolen cookies.  Every now 
and then something else my mother was able to
 forage.  But my mother came home one day 
extremely excited and happy.  She had ma de a 
great coup, a conquest.  
She brought home this 
treasure.  She carefully unwrapped 
this thing.  I couldn™t wait to 
see what it could possibly be.  
She  kept on unwrapping this handkerchief. It wasin this piece of cloth.  
 Finally there was this 
two- inch square of -- or ma ybe it was one in
ch, I don™t know -- it looked like a big domi no of 
some thing white.  I™d never seen it.  I didn™t know wh
at it was.  I said to my mother, what is it?  
It was such a treasure!  She said, it™s fat, wh
ich didn™t mean anything to me  but it did finally 

mean that she was able to fry those gr eens and they
 had a little tast e rather than eating them raw 
or boiling them. 
 

Q: Earlier you me ntioned that you saw this embroi
dered picture with the star, a person wearing a 
star.  Did you see any people, re
al people wearing those stars? 
 

A: Ye s, I was one of them a nd so was my mother.  
My mother was very talented at all needle work.  
She was a wonderful seamstress.  My mother had 
made me a beautiful -- she must have made it 
-- well I guess it coul d ha ve been after the bl itzkri
eg.  Maybe it was a birthday present, in fact, 
ma ybe I think it was a birthday present. 
 

Q: A birthday after the blitzkrieg? 
 
A: Possibly or the one after that, 
I don™t really know. That period is
 very -- it™s all very fuzzy.  I 
mean my memories are more anecdotal than they
 are historic. There™s no real sequence.  I 
guess they™re in some  sort of sequence but it 
doesn™t  really tell you much, well ma ybe it does.  
S o  my  mo t h e r  ma d e  me  t h i s  c o a t  a n d I  r e me mb e r
 this lovely spring coat.  It was a very pale 
gray tweed and it had little nubs of 
color, little colors.The colors 
were all pastel, little bumps all 
over this fabric. They were beautiful, pale lave
nder and pink and light gr
een and blue and just 
sort of a capelet, a litt
le cape on top of the shoulders.  I reme
mber that I couldn™t wait for it to 
get warm enough to wear this wonderful treasure th
at my mot her had made. When I finally -- it 
was time to wear to it my mother sewed this ve
ry ugly yellow star on my left shoulder and my 
left shoulder blade. And I protested veheme ntly a
nd she simply told me  not to discuss it.  It was 

a fact and to ignore it. 
 

Q: This was your first yellow star? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Then this wa s before you had s
een that -- the embroidered picture? 
 

A: Ye s, yes. We ll, the yellow stars became co
mmon.  I also remember my mother comi ng home 
one day.  She had a navy coat a
nd it had a black fur collar, a shiny 
-- a seal.  It must have been a 
seal collar or a black Persian , or I don™t know
, some thing, a black fur collar. When she came 
home  -- and the coat had yellow 
stars on it -- when she returned home from wherever she had 

been, the fur had been removed from her coat. She explained to our roomma te that all fur had 
to be donated to the German ar my because they need
ed it.  Of course, the coat was ruined.  So I 

reme mber that.  One day my mother came home 
a nd she had this young girl with her.  She was 
a teenage girl and I was supposed to reme mber 
her, but I only vaguely remembered her.  
Apparently this girl had been 
a student of my fat her ™s in 
Wa rsaw.  My mother, by chance, 
bumped into her some where in town and brought 
this girl whose name  was  Rya. She sat me  on 
her lap and in her no nonsense sort of way, she 
said to me , you must go with Rya and when I 
can, I will come for you. When will you come for me?   Crusscoov. 
 

Q: You heard that one before? 

 

A: Of course, my mother never came for me. 

 

Q: Do you have any idea when this was?   How 
ma ny winters, for example, had passed since you 
had been wandering? 
 

A: I know that this incident wa
s at the very end of summer.  It was probably the same  summer 
which the preceding spring had brought the pr etty 
coat and the yellow star experience and all 
that sort of thing. 
 

Q: The same  ye ar that you had the incidentwith the picture, the 
embroidered picture? 
 

A: Ye s, probably although --.  I would imagine that 
that was very close, those events were very 
close to each other. The events that I told you 
before, traveling with my father, the train, the 
bombing with the blankets over th
e head and all that; I think that
 was probably a year before.  
So that mi ght have been, say 1941. 
 

Q: Prettygoodguess. 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Did you see German sol diers? 

 

A: Ye s, yes. We ll, of course, yes. 

 

Q: More so than before? 

 

A: Ye s, I didn™t really see a great deal of Germ
an soldiers when I was still with my mother, 
although yes, some . 
 

Q: Any explosions, aircraft, bombings? 

 

A: A lot, a lot.  I told you about
 listening to my mother ™s  knitti
ng needles in bomb shelters and 
cellars and that sort of thing. That was not
hing, that was daily, some ti me s twice daily.  Many 
times, that was --that was just ordinary.  In fact
, at one point, I was pushe
d down some stairs, or 
a ladder or so me thing and my nose was broken.  It wasn™t  even known until the next da y that 

my nose was broken beca use we were  in the da rk.  It wasn™t  until the light that my mother saw 

that I was completely br ui sed --
 my nose had been shattered. 
 

Q: You were some place in the western Ukraine, la
te summer, end of summer
 ™41 and your mother 
is now giving you to this young woman w
ho was also fromWa rsaw originally? 
 
A No.  Now I have to give you a little bit of b
ackground.  First of all, Rya was no more than a 
teenager at that point. 
 I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17.  I would have been say 
five and a half, six.  So Rya was, I don™t know, 
ten years older. A little background– In the 
Ukraine, what I know of the Ukra
ine, there are little 
villages.  Obviously, there are big towns 
but the countryside of the Ukrain
e wa s–This is another life, 
now I™m giving you history that I 
-- this is where I lived. There 
were little villages which were
 connected to each other by dirt 
roads.  During the summer these roads were traversed by horse drawn carriage, not carriages 

but carts. The villages -- surr
ounding these villages were the fa
r ms. The land had been divided 
after the fall of the Czars, Czar, FirstWorl
dWa r, had been divided among the peasants.  
Previous to that, it was owned by the Churc
h.  So that now although the people were very 

religious and were very loyal to 
the village priest and they we re very generous to him; he was 
no longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they ha
d been during the time  of t he Czars, during 

White Russia.  But because the peasants were reli
gious, the priests lived a far better life than did 
the peasants.  Now it™s the Greek Orthodox Churc
h, the Bible is in Greek. The priests ma rry 
and have families. The fa milies were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village. The children 

of the priests became the postmaster, the school t
eachers, the ma yor, if there was such a thing.  
They sort of ran the community. 
 

Q: They could read and write? 

 

A: They could read and write.  Some  f them were
 very highly educated. The more wealthy was the 
priest, the better educated were his children.  In or
der to be educated they
 were sent ﬁabroadﬂ.  
Abroad me a nt great cities in Europe likeWa rsaw 
where this particular  Rya, child of a priest  in 
an Ukrainian village would up studying inWa rsaw 
with my father. Appa
rently she took private 
lessons at home  or some how or other got home to
 meet my mother and be
came ena mored of my 
mother and became a frequent visitor.  I to
ld you earlier about th
e generosity of my 
grandmother and her warmth and so forth, and 
I am sure that my mo
ther befriend this young 
girl from the Ukraine in a similar sort of way,
 although this girl was not of peasant stock.  But 
my mother liked her and they had a relationship. 
Therefore, when my mother bumped into her 
in town and explained our plight, Rya must have
 asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than 
four -- and Rya must have played with me  or po
ssibly babysat or whatever. So when my mother 
explained our plight and the possibilities of our
 disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and 
religious teenager said, well I™ll 
take her home and hide her with 
me , without any thought to the 
consequences or to the reaction of her fa mily or
 the possible danger to herself, her family, the 
entire village, the future, I mean, you know, 
nothing.  She simply offered and my mother 
jumped at the opportunity.  So my mother sent me
 off with a little pack
age of clothing wrapped 
around a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now
 significantly smaller than I was.  I 
reme mber walking down the front steps.  I reme
mber my mother standi
ng on the stairs saying 
don™t turn around.  Just go, walk through the 
gate and don™t turn around, keep walking.  
Re me mber what I told you, reme mb er what I 
told you. We  walked through the -- down the 
stairs and through the garden.  I reme mber th
at the garden was overgrown and unkempt and 
wilted and a great ma ss of jungle.  It had been cu
ltivated at one time. That™s why I -- it was late 
summer.  I reme mber walking with Rya holding
 my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and 
Rya with the bundle. We  walked out and I turn
ed once to look at my mother and she was 
holding a handkerchief up to her face.  She ye
lled again don™t turn around, keep walking.  
That™s my last me mory of my mother.  I don™t ev
en reme mber getting to the village or anything 

about it.  I don™t reme mber arriving, I don™t remember any of that. 
 
Q: Had you reme mbered Rya from before?   Or were you -- as fa r as you were concerned this was a 
stranger? 
 

A: No, I mi ght have -- I don™t know, I really don™
t know.  I don™t reme mber whether I reme mbered 
then or–I wa s just an obedient child and I we
nt– If my mo ther said 
she would come for me , 
she would come  for me .  If she said that I woul
d be safe and I should go, 
that was it.  I trusted 
my mother and I knew not to argue with my mother. 
 

Q: We re you wearing your yellow star? 

 

A: I don™t know.  I don™t imagine so, I don™t know.  I™m not sure that that yellow star was on 
summer clothing.  I think it mi ght have only been on outerwear.  I real
ly don™t recall that. 
 

Q: But Rya knew you were Jewish? 

 

A: Rya. 

 

Q: Rya. 

 

A: Ye s, yes.  So now we arrive in the village of 
the Ukraine.  I™ll describe 
the village to you. There 
was a dirt road through which you 
got to the village. When you got to the village, there were 
houses, there™s one in these pictures some where. 
There™s a ma n standing in front of it -- I was 
looking at it before and now I can™t  find it.  It™s
 kind of log cabins with 
thatched roofs. Why 
don™t you turn that off for a mo me nt
 and I™ll look fo
r the pictures? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: There were houses like I pointed
 out to you with thatched roof
s, log cabin kind of houses, but 
whitewashed; whitewashed log cabins. Then the ro
ad split like a wishbone
.  In the crook of the 
wishbone sat a small, white church with steps 
going up.  It had a large 
door and two windows.  
When I looked at it, it looked like a clown face b
ecause it had a big window on each side of the 
door and the steps -- it looked like a clown with 
his tongue hanging out. It
 had a sharp point at 
the top of the cross with the sl
ash underneath. The road went 
around it.  Behind the church was 
a small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses.  
There was a legend that the cross of the priest  
whose fa mily I was about to live with, that st one cross grew every year. The people wee so 

superstitious and they had revered this particular 
priest to such a degree that these legends about 
him grew. Anyway, the houses conti
nued as the road -- the two roads– 
 

Q: Diverg ed. 

 

A: Diverged, exactly behind the church.  I would 
say that at the very most there were 30 to 50 
houses. That was the entire town.  On the le
ft side behind our house, which was the most 
elegant house, it was a clapboard
 house, very different from 
the other cabins–Further back 
behind our house was a stream and then a forest. On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I 

was facing the church wa s a road that led out to
 the fields where all of the various wheat and 
grain and hemp and barley and whatever all was 
grown was. That was the entire town. There 
was no electricity, there were no automobiles, 
there were no telephones
. The donation that I 

made to you, I wrote a little piec
e to go with it. The little dress we grew our own hemp. We  
spun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn.  It 
was loomed at home, on a loom.  I sewed it by 
hand.  Life was primitive.  I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries 
before. That was the life of the village. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: So I™ve described the village to you.  Okay, th
e household.  I mean I could describe our house.  
Ve ry briefly, I™ll tell you that 
life was centered for the most part around the kitchen, primarily 
because it was the warmest place. There was no cen
tral heating of any kind, in fact. There is 
usually a fireplace in one room and the wall agains
t which the fireplace is in one room is the 
bed wall in the adjacent room si mply because 
of the heat, you know, the warmth.There was one 
room which must have been th
e back of the kitchen, the wall behind where the oven where we 
baked our bread was. We  used to sit in that r
oom a great deal.  Or if not sit, we would stand 

with our hands behind our back leaning on that wa rm wall. We  would take turns because only 

one spot on the wall was really warm and so we 
would take turns. That was how our evenings 

were spent. We  would tell stories.  In fact, Rya devised a game .  She would start a story.  She 

would say Mirka andVa li were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic.  When they 

got out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out 
from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she 
would point to me  and I would have to pick up th
e story. Then I would take the story to some  
precipice and the next person would go on with it. 
This is how we entertained ourselves at 
night and then we would all go to sleep. 
 

Q: Just you and Rya? 

 

A: No and other me mbers of the fa mily. 
 
Q: We re there other brothers–? 

 

A Ye s, I™ll tell you about that. That™s  how our even
ings were spent. There wasn™t  muc h to the 
evening because we woke up to the roosters.  
They took off with the 
first light, they would 
crow.  Life would start at five 
in the morning or whatever it was 
and I am sure we were all in 
bed and asleep by dark. 
 

Q: Candlelight? 

 

A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps.  Okay, the me mbers of the fa mily. The priest had died some  
years before, two, three, five, I don™t know. The wi
fe of the priest was very highly revered in 
the town and she was, in fact, feared.  Sh
e was spoken of in the third person, you know.  
Enormous r e spect was accorded her.  She was 
spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a 
god or a mo narch, or whatever. Ve ry highly respect
ed and revered.  People paid court. There 
were obligatory visits that
 they had to ma ke. They brought bask
ets of fruit, or whatever, to visit 
her. They would nod in our direction whethe
r we were sitting by the window or not, nod 
toward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing.  Now she was a very 

bright woma n.  It was decided that my new iden
tity was going to be that she was -- she spoke 

fl uent Polish -- she was very well educated.  Sh
e was fl uent in Polish so my identity was going 
to be that she was Polish and had ma rried the Uk
rainian priest but she had a sister back in 
Poland and I was that sister ™s  child. That 
was -- since I came from, I don™t know where, 

wherever they had me  c o me  from in Poland, my 
Ukrainian wa s not perfect, my Russian was not 

absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse.  I wa
s brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or 
her relative, or whatever and th
at was why my na me  was diff eren
t.  I didn™t  look exactly like 
them and that was my beard. 
 
Q: You were given a new last name? 

 

A: Ye s, yes.  So I had a new last name  which wa
s a Polish last name . Theirs was a Russian name , 
obviously.  I reme mber only that my name was 
purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs 
ended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski,
 I think.  In any case, so I was --well, it™s 
irrelevant, okay, I won™t give 
you all that.  In any case, this
 woma n had five children. The 
oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really
 didn™t take too terribly well to education.  I 
don™t think he was ever sent abroa
d.  He was sort of more intere
sted in farming.  He was very 
practical, he was the farmer.  He was huge, he ha
d a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his 
own cigarettes, he spat into a 
spittoon. You know, he was more like a peasant.  He was very 
well liked and respected and he was like one 
of the boys and probably the head boy, you know. 
Then there was a mi ddle son and he was very rebellious.  He ultimately ra n off to the forest and 

was with the partisans.  In fact, I used to hi
de out by the woods when the Germans came. At 
one point, I was hidden in the hayl
oft, haystack rather.  He onc
e or twice came  and gave  me  
me ssages which I carried back.  But I hardlyreme mber hi m because he left.  I don™t even 

reme mber his name.  I reme mber that his mother
  -- I reme mb er his mother describing him to 
some one, and she said, and it™s funny because 
it™s an expression that I™ve used ma ny times 
because it de scribe d him so well, it describe d his 
nature.  She said that this mi ddle son when he 
has a cause  or feels strongly about so me thing woul
d fight until he  was up to his knees in blood.  

I don™t know whether that was a Russian saying but
 I™ve heard myself s a ying that in describing 
such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn pers
on. The youngest son was two years older than 
I was.  His name  wasVa li and I was -- he and I slept in the same  bed.  I was, I don™t know, five 
and a half, six; he was two years older.  I can de
scribe him perfectly.  He wa s very tow headed.  
He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. 
 It was just above the widow™s peak where his 
hairline began.  He had a sort of a double cowlic
k with cowlicks going in opposite directions at 
that point.  Because of that, his ha ir was almost
 shaved off.  Because had it not been, it probably 
wouldn™t have been able to sort of
 stay all in the same direction. 
 So he has this Russian version 
of a crew cut.  So those were the three sons
. The two daughters were Rya, who I™ve already 
told you about and the older one whose name  I r
eally don™t reme mber and whom I didn™t get to 
know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town.  So she had some  sort 

of office type job.  Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, 

the provider and the ma n about the house. Va li 
was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the 
mi ddle boy was the rebellious, I don™t  know, 14 year old he  was, who ran off and joined the 

partisans and became what we called a Cossack.  So that was the househol d.  Now I was not 

received with any degree of love or kindness.  I wa
sn™t  sheltered or shielded or loved at all.  I 
was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of
 taken care of but never with kindness, never 
with love.  I was never complimented.  If I 
did some thing very well, it wa s -- more than 
anything I had the feeling of rese
ntment.  Furthermore, I was from the city.  I was urbane and 
Va li was a peasant.  He had never been to the 
city.  I described the building in which I lived 
which had four floors.  He coul
dn™t understand that there was a r
oom above a room.  I explained 
to him that it was like the attic where they dried 
their apple slices on a  
-- strung from one end to 
another -- and stored things. Al
so like the cellar where the cabbage
 slaw was kept and that, in 
fact, his house had three floors.  But these were
 four floors of one above the other, bedrooms  
and, you know, apartments.  I described one apartment building.  He couldn™t conceive of such 

a thing.  He couldn™t conceive of such a thing as 
chocolate either.  So that
 when we we re finally 

invaded by the German a r my, the first time I 
was hidden in the hays
tack which I already 
me ntioned.  But then they went back and forth 
and in and out. They were, you know, driven out 
by the Russians and there was fighting back and fort
h.  So they were there several times, in and 
out. At some point, I became very brazen and I 
wound up sitting on the laps of officers. They 
would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with 
me  and so forth and give me  chocolate.  I 
would then take the chocolate and give it toVa
li.  Until the mother found out about this and put 
a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely li
fe threatening.We ll, anyway I never really 
had any love.  I was incredibly lonely.  I kept  thinking about my mother.  One day, it just 
occurred to me  that she™s not living and she™ll 
never come  back.  Meanwhile the mother,Va li™s 
mother, Rya™s mother, was teaching me  to read, to 
sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. Ta ught me  
all the things, how to spin, how
 to weave, how to sew, how 
to me nd, how to cook a little bit 
although it was very difficult because of the prim
itive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron 
pots. You know, children couldn™t physically ma
nage that but everyone had jobs and mi ne was 
peeling the potatoes.  In the time  
that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled 
ten truckloads of potatoes, that™s  
all I did.  I peeled potat
oe s.  I read with the mother and at first 
she would read to me .  She read me  Bible stories.
  She would read to me  and she would point to 
the words with her finger.  I would watch her 
mo ving finger across the page and then she would 
turn the page and there would be 
a pictur e that  related to the stor
y. She would continue the story 
and I kind of fell in love with one story.  I kept
 asking her to read it ove
r and over.  It was the 
story of the prodigal son.  I don™
t know why I liked that one es
pecially but some how– So she 
read it over and over and then one day in the mi ddl
e of the story, she sort of looked up and she 
said, you read, and I did. And not only did I read
 but -- ma ybe because I 
had heard that one so 
many ti mes -- I understood it and I read
 it and we turn the page and went on to the next story.  
At one point we turned the page and there was a 
pictur e of little gi rls cr
ossing a little bridge 
over a -- you know -- like a little
 stream. Hovering -- and 
there was a very sort of rickety little 
bridge, ma ybe a log, whatever it was, and it 
looked dangerous with the rushing water 
underneath.  Hovering in flight w
ith arms outstretched behind the 
little child was an angel with 
beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. I 
said what is that a
nd she explained to me  
about angels. I said everybody has an
 angel?   She said every child 
has an angel to protect it.  I 
said even Jewish children?   She said yes, even
 Jewish children and even you. You have a very 

special angel.  So that night I went to sleep 
and I woke up and I knew who my angel was.  I was 
absolutely certain that my own angel was the infa
nt Jesus and that I would be protected because 
I had a Jewish angel.  No harm woul d come  to me
.  I knew that I would be
 all right.  I can tell 
you a lot of stories about life in 
that village.  I was there two 
Christma ses and three Easters or 
ma ybe the other way around.  It™s  the other 
way around. One day, you™re not going to believe 
this, you™re not going to believe this– One day in
 the mi ddle of the severest winter, a horse 
drawn sled came  into town on the road, which wa
s an event.  I me an nothing came in the winter. 
Sometimes, you know, if the German army was 
t here, the trucks came but we never saw 

anything like cars or–.  In fact, 
once a car came and all the child
ren of the village gathered 
around the car and stared at it 
as if it was a flying saucer. 
 

Q: You had seen one before, hadn™t you? 

 

A: Well, I mean to me, it was cars, I mean it was 
nothing, I had been in cars
.  My grandfather had a 
yard full of big shiny black cars and I reme mber
 sitting on his lap and blowing the horn, it was 

outside the car, you know, one of those things you squeezed.  I mean cars -- was nothing to me .  

I was a city child. I reme mber being fascinated wa
tching all these children 
staring at the car like 
it was some
thing really.  But in any ca se, it wa
s a great event in the mi
ddle of winter, a sled 
came from -- into town.  Also a wagon, you know, 
a sled came from -- into town. Also a 

wagon, you know, a sled pulled by a single horse w
ith a bell and a guy huddled up and dressed 
in -- bundled with a whip.  He 
came right to our house and Rya came to me  and she said Mirka 
do you reme mber your uncle Jacob. This is a note  from your uncle Jacob.  He™s  waiting for 
you.  I was put on the sled the next morning.  
That morning,Va li, the little boy who was two 
years older than I, disappeared and hid with my 
teddy bear.  Finally the sled driver wa s anxious 
to leave and we could wait no longer a
nd I had to leave without my teddy bear. 
 

Q: For the first time in your life? 

 

A: Ye s. That teddy bear is alive and well and li
ving in the Ukraine and I know that.  Because that -
-that artifact would never be de
stroyed or discarded, never. 
 

Q: They loved ____teddy bears? 

 

A: I know that teddy bear is livi
ng and well some where in the Ukraine.  So several hours later, by 
sled, we got into town and a tall extremely ha
ndsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he 
looked kind of like Clark Gable or
 possibly–.. No, no even more distinguished than that, not as 
roma ntic a figure but the one who 
-- what was that great war movi
e, Mrs. Miniver, who was the 
husband of Mrs. Miniver?   Not Gregory Peck, 
Wa lter Pidgeon.  So my 
uncle Jacob, looking like 
Wa lter Pidgeon, in black shiny boots, very natty, very
 straight like a soldier,
 lifted me  out of the 
wagon and set me  down.  I looked up at him, 
up, up, up; he was so tall.  He  said, do you 

reme mber me?   I said, of c
ourse, you™re uncle Jacob.  How do you reme mber me ?  And he 
carried me  into the house and I told him the stor
y of when the horse kicked him in the chest. 
 

Q: Those were the days. 

 
A: We ll, uncle Jacob and I traveled around Europe. 
We  went to a number of capitols.  I reme mber 
that we went to -- I think we were
 in four or five countries. We  traveled by those same  railroad 
cars, looking for survivors. We  lived in rooms 
that were incredibly cold.  I™d like to tell you 
about one experience but first I™m sure you™d li
ke to know how it was that uncle Jacob found 
this needle in the haystack hidde
n in a village in the Ukraine when
 he had been in Siberia.  So 
now I™ll tell you a story that you wi
ll not believe. Uncle Jacob le
ft Siberia where he had been 
put in charge  because he was, I had told you be
fore he was so trustworthy and efficient and 
good at everything, so he had been put in charge of the food supply, ma inly the meat.  He was 

the head butcher in charge of -- he never touched 
the meat but he was in charge of all the food.  
With the little bit of black marketing and fi nag
ling that he di d, he was able to fill several 
suitcases or bundles with goods, ladies™ silk und
erwear– I don™t know wh
ere he got all this 
stuff.  I™ m s ure they were payoffs for favors or 
whatever but as we traveled around Europe later, 
after he found me , those suitcases 
got lighter and lighter because their contents is what kept us 
fed. 
 

Q: That was your money?  

 

A: That was our money.  He also kept a journal.
  Unfortunately, at one 
point, we had to cross a 
border where I was told that I was to play the pa
rt of a deaf mute sin
ce we were going -- I didn™t 
speak the language of wherever we were going.  
He was so fearful that he burned the journal 

and it was the history of the entire war, day 
by day, from the time  he leftWarsaw.  So 
unfortunately a great treasure was -- and I watc
hed that burn, I watched 
that burn. That was a 
daily log. Anyway Jacob left Siberia and travel
ed until he  -- traveled to ma ny places. At one 

point he wound up in this town.  
 
Q: The town that™s  near the v
illage where you had been staying? 
 

A: Ye s. The way the Jews Œ there were no tr
ain schedules, you know.  People would -- if they 
wanted to go east, they went to the platform
 where the train was heading east was going and 
they sat on the platform for a day, for an hour, fo
r a week, whatever, until the train came. When 
the train came, they boarded the train and they we
nt east. When the train stopped, they got off 
or they kept going or whatever 
and that™s  how people got around.  So there were always people 
sitting on the platform. They were going either ea
st or west or wherever
 they were going, north, 

south, waiting, sitting on platforms. We ll, appa
rently, Jacob got off the platform and I have 

already described to you that he was extremely 
handsome, ve ry nattily dressed, which was very 
unusual, highly unusual.  So this handsome  guy ge
ts off the train with 
two bulging suitcases and 
the wome n were extremely attracted to him.  He
 began to talk to a woma n who was waiting for 
a train which was going east -- in the opposite direc
tion -- into, towards Si be
ria.  Is that east? 
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: The direction from whence he had come. 

 

A: From whence he had come .  So he gets off the tr
ain, he™s on the platform, he begins to chat with 
this woman. What is your name?  That 
woma n was the only huma n being who knew my 
whereabouts. She was the woma n who had shar
ed the room with me  and my mother. 
 
Q: Before your mother gave you to Rya? 
 

A: Ye s.  Had her train come  first---.  It was abso
lute sheer chance!  He said Berliner, my mother 
had changed her name, she was no longer using her married name because she was so 

disillusioned with her husband, my father.  So 
she had gone back to her name , Berliner. This 
woma n said oh your name is Jacob Be rliner.  My
 dear friend was Berlin
er.  My uncle -- I™m 
hearing this -- apparently fainted.  Her train ca
me.  She got on the train and disappeared.  He 
wasn™t  sure what niece.  He didn™t get all the fa
cts.  He knew the village, he knew a child.  He 
thought it might be me  but it could have been an
y number of his nieces. 
 He didn™t know.  He 
fainted.  I don™t know how long he was on the platform. Anyway, he was found passed out by 

some one who I think was also a priest.  He 
was taken home to that person™s  house, maybe 
because he looked wealthy, I don™t know whatev
er.  In any case, apparently he was sick, 
delirious, ill, I don™t know, whatever for a number ofdays.  In that time, he told us later that he 

had a dream.  In the dream, he dreamed he was back inWa rsaw, it was before the war.  He was 

wearing his tails and top hat because he had come 
from a ball or gone to the opera, or  whatever 
it was.  He was walking along the street with hi
s walking stick and as he
 got near the street 
lamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety
 clop of an oncoming carriage.  It was a very 
foggy night and out of the fog approached this ho
rse drawn black carriage.
  He tried to peer 
inside but he couldn™t see because of the f
og but it stopped right under the street lamp. A 
woma n leaned forward and she was 
all dressed in white.  Here comes the lump in the throat.  It  

was my mot her, his young sister.  
She said,Yacov, take care of
 my child.  He knew who it was 
and it was the next day that he
 sent  this sled to get me. 
 

Q: She was your guardian angel? 
 

A: Perhaps, you™re right, perhaps you™re right. 

 

Q: So that it was on a hunch, limited information, and a dream? 

 

A: And a dream. An absolute meeting by chance. 
Two trains comi ng from different directions Œ 
people chatting on a platfor m.  It wouldn™t have ha
ppened if he was ragge
dy like all the rest but 
he was so natty and so attractiv
e and this woma n began to -- sh
e was attracted to him and began 
to chat with him. I just want to tell you that
 when I was born, apparently I was a very sickly 
infant. The story goes that I couldn™t be cured. 
 I apparently had all 
of the childhood diseases, 
all at the same  ti me . Anyway I was given up 
for dead.  I had everything including whooping 
cough, all at the same  time . They gave me  up, this
 child will never live.  Finally my mother in 
desperation said well, then she™ll die at home. 
 She took me out of the 
hospital away from the 
specialists and so forth and t
ook me home to a room that sh
e had painted white, everything 
including the floor. She had prepared this room 
for me .  She  took me  into this room and no one 
was allowed in the room.  She cared for me hersel
f.  No one could come into the room until her 
brother Jacob came. She said to him, Jacob, I kno
w this sounds ridiculous.  Everything has been 
done for my  child and my child is given up for 
dead. There are no more me dical cures. I know 

you™ll think it™s silly but there™s one 
last thing that we haven™t done. 
We  haven™t tried to fool the 
dybbuk, the dybbuk wants my child.  He says tell me
, I™ll do anything.  My mother said, we 
must fool the dybbuk into thinking this is a differ
ent child.  He said well what, what should we 
do?   So she said to hi m, well I will sell you th
is child and you will give  he r a new name  and 
she™ll be yours and then the dybbuk won™t want he
r anymore because it™s not the child that the 

dybbuk wants.  He said all right.  How much do 
you want for her?  She said well what is a 
child™s life worth?   Give  me  your hat.  He took 
off his hat.  She said okay take this ha t, fill it 
with pennies, bring it back and I 
will give you my  child.  So he  went and he  filled the ha t with 
pennies and he came back and he bought me .  She 
said, Jacob, what is your child™s name ?   He 
said her name is Chai Berliner.  Chai because it 
means life. And I survived and I got well.  So I 
was very precious to Jacob. All that bubba me insa
 fits, you see.  It just was meant that Jacob 
would find me . All right, so Jacob and I traveled
.We  stayed in all kinds of places. There was 
one time I reme mber, he woke me  very early in the morning. We  were in a room somewhere.  

We  had slept -- it was so cold.  I used to slee
p on top of him, huddled on top of his chest, 
snuggled up.  I was tiny, teeny.  He woke me , he
 s a id quickly get up, we must get dressed.  But 
Wujaszek I called himWujaszek, wujak in Polish 
is uncle, wujaszek is dimi nutive, a loving --.  

ButWujaszek, but it™s still dark, it™s so cold, I 
can™t get dressed.  He said here you dress inside 
the bed, under the covers. While you dress, I™ll 
get you the milk.  I have milk.  He reached for 

the milk which was sitting in a bottle on the corn
er but the bottle was fu
ll and it had -- the milk 
had frozen and the 
bottle had cracked. 
 

Q: But it was still fr ozen? 

 

A: Ye s, but it wa s still frozen. That™s  how cold 
our room was. Anyway we dressed and he said 
come we mu st go to the market. To the mark
et, why are we going to the ma rket?   It™s the 
mi ddle of the night.  He said, come , we must 
rush, we must run.  He explained nothing.  I 

dressed and we walked and walked and walked.  It 
was still da rk and we got to the market in the 

first light of morning.  Instead 
of the usual stalls, the farmers 
selling their produce, there were 
just hundreds and hundreds of people 
in this cobblestone ma rketpla
ce. As the morning dawned, 
Jacob said I™m going to put you on my shoulde
rs.  I want you to watch and no ma tter how 

horrible the sight, I want you to keep your eyes 
open and watch.  I said,Wujaszek, what am I 
going to see?  Why are we here?   He said th
ey™ve caught some  Ger man
 officers and they are 
going to hang them and I want you to watch. Wh y?
  He said because I don™t want you to have 
any hate.The ma n you™re going to see hanged is 
the ma n who murdered your mother.  He sat 
me on his shoulders and I watched three men bei
ng hung.  He just didn™t want me  to hate.  He 
wanted it all to -- he wanted me  to be healthy 
-- to let it all out in this one traumatic, ugly, 
horribl e experience. 
 
Q: How did he know that this officer killed your mother?   Did he know where your mother had 
been? 
 

A: Obviously he didn™t. 
 It was just, just Œ 
 

Q: Therapy?  

 

A: It was just therapy.  It was his way. There 
was no connection whatsoever.  He just didn™t want 
me  to hate anyone. I have to admit 50 years later that it didn™t work.  I can™t hear German 

spoken without -- it didn™t  work.  He
 used to leave me  alone in the room.  He would say, here™s 

food, here™s  my watch.   I™m going to be gone for 
eight hours.  I™ll be back
 at seven o™clock.  I 
want you to sit here and listen to 
the radio.  Here™s paper and pencil.
  Just listen.  If you hear -- 
don™t change  the st ation -- it™s on 
just the station.  Listen carefully, if anythi ng sounds familiar, 
write it down.  I would listen a
ll day to coded me ssages, me ssages likeWujaszek is searching 
for the little girl who untied his 
shoe laces -- only usually shorter.
  Or there would be lists of 
name s. The following are documented to have died inTr eblinka and then an hour of name s.  

He would come  home, what do you have?  While
 I was doing that, he was going to various 
agencies, searching and looking and authentica
ting and documenting deaths and looking for 
survivors.There were none.  Finally one day he 
said that™s it.We  got into one of those boxcars 
of which there is a photograph that I gave you.  
It™s  only ma ny years later in the United St ates 
that I realized what was written on 
the exterior of that boxcar.  It™s
 in English and in He brew.  It 
says ﬁTo Liberty.ﬂAnd ﬁFromAuschwitz to New 
York.ﬂYou know when I arrived in the United 
St ates I didn™t  speak any English whatsoever.  I 
knew two words; they we
re okay and I reasoned 
that if okay meant yes then obviously nokay me a nt no. 
 

Q: The little schooling you had would have been–? 

 

A: The little schooling I had was at 
the knee of the Ukrainian mother. 
A little bit of schooling in 
the village but only until it got t
oo cold for me  to walk barefoot
 to the school because I had no 
shoesThen in the D.P. camp to which we went 
in that boxcar and the D.P. camp was in Munich.  
We  were in the D.P. camp for, I can™t tell you 
how long, ma ybe a year or more.  In the D.P. 
camp, Jacob had the job of being in charge of the 
social hall which meant he was the electrician, 
the plumber; he set up the chairs
, he took them down, he was the stage ma nager and he was the 
emcee of all the various goings on.  Being handsome and charmi ng and witty, he was the 

perfect emcee.  I went to school in the morning 
but school wa s mostly the learning of Hebrew.  
Because mo st of the people in the D.P. camp, all 
of them, were going to Pa lestine.  It was kind 

of e mbarrassing or shameful to admit that we we re going toAmerica.  So I went to school and 

studied Hebr ew. When I came to the United St at
es, I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian.  I could 

understand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little 
bit of German and somewhat more, I was able 
to understand but not speak fluently,Yi ddish.  
If I™m not mi staken, that™s  seven languages. 
 

Q: Had you known anyYi ddish before? 
 

A: We ll, my gr andparents in their home  spokeYi
ddish and Polish so I heard it. There was no 
Yi ddish spoken between my parent
s.  Of course, I heard it after 
my experience in the Ukraine as 
we were displaced persons traveling from place to 
place.  I left out one part of the st ory and I 
will tell it to you as briefl y as I can. The one part
 of my story which I never really told and the 
reason I™m telling you now is that earlier today, I to
ld it in front of my children.  It™s the first 
time my children ever heard it.  So now I feel at li
bert y to tell it to the wo
rld.  It™s  not some thing 
of which I™m proud of but it™s  a si
gnificant part of my 
life.  My father left us. I can™t  with all 
honesty say that he deserted us.  
But it sure felt that way.  My
 father was a blue- eyed blond.  
My father was a linguist, he was fluent in German
 and he could pass. Wh ereas, he promised to 
send for us, he didn™t.  It could easily have been
 impossible.  It™s  not some thing I™ll ever know.  
But I resent ed my father and when my mother
 became Berliner again, changing her name  back 
to her maiden name, I simply went along with th
at.  I went along with my  mother ™s attitude 
about my fat her which wasn™t  generous. It wasn™t
 severe or bad either 
but their last months 
together were not affectionate.  So I felt th
at my father had betrayed and deserted me  
throughout the war and I never t
hought about him. In the D.P.
 camp, while Jacob was working 
at the duties in th
e social hall which was an all day and 
evening job, I went to school in the 
morning where I studied Hebrew. Then when sc
hool ended in the morning, I would have lunch 
with Jacob and then I was free in
 the afternoon. Now Jacob told me  that we were going to go to 
America on a ship across a big ocean. The ship
 would sway back and forth and there was a 
good possibility that I would be seasick.  I had ne ve
r been seasick but he described it. To avoid 
that, it would be a wonderful id
ea if I acclimated myself to th
e swaying motion by going to the 
playground and spending my time on the swings. 
 So I spent every af
ternoon on the swings.  
Now the swings faced a cyclone fence.  On th
e opposite side of the fence, this was Munich, 
there was a bench, a bus stop and 
in the afternoon a bus would 
come . Now I sat on the swings, 
swinging back and forth every day.
   Every day about an hour before the bus came, or half an 
hour, an old woma n would come  and she would s
it on the bench and she would take out of her 

bag, a little package of crumbs.  She would thro
w the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or 
whatever it was.  She would turn around and 
she would nod to me . This  happened afternoon 
after afternoon so finally we be
gan to chat. Then one day she said to me , why are you spending 
so much ti me on the swings?  So I explained 
I™m going on a long voyage on a ship. I™m going to 
America and I know that I™m going to get seasic
k and I explained the whole thing.  She said, 
you know, I have a brother inAmerica.  Some  
day, I™m going to go to my brother when my 

quota number come s up.  I said well if you™re going 
to go on a ship, then you will be wise to get 
acclimated to the swaying also. From then on, in
stead of feeding the bi
rds and sitting on the 
bench, she would come  inside and she would sit 
on the swings. We  would swing back and forth 
criss-crossing each other and chatting away.  One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk 

about our backgrounds.. She began to ask me  
questions. Wh at is your name , who are you, 
where are you from?   I told her about my life be
fore the blitzkrieg inWa rsaw, my father had 
been a viol inist and a violin teacher.  She said tell me  his name .  I told her his name . The next 

day she returned and we sat on the swings and sh
e said to me, tell me , do you have any ma rks 
on your body?  Anything that could identify you?  
Anything that™s  different from anyt hing that 
anybody in the world has?   I said yes.  I have 
a beauty ma rk on my right forearm, shoulder.  
When I was a little girl, my grandfather used to
 tease me  by ma king believe he took the beauty 
ma rk off my  right forearm until I began to cry. Then he™d sa y, don™t cry, don™t cry, I™ll gi ve it 

back.Then he would give it ba
ck to me  on my left forearm 
or shoulder and I would look and 
there it would be.  So she left and came  back
 the next day and she said, that was a very 

interesting story about your gr
andfather but isn™t there anythi
ng else on your body
, any scars, 

anything that™s different and unique
?   I said well, I don™t like to
 talk about it but we have a 
fa mily trait and I was born with 
it also. We  have six toes.  My
 uncle Jacob has six toes on one 
foot. When I was born, I had six toes on each foot. They were surgically removed and I have a 
scar on each foot. The next 
day the woma n ca me and brought 
my father.  I don™t know where 
he survived but I think in Germany. We ll my fat h
er insisted that I stay with him but we were 
going to sail two weeks hence.  Having waited 
for our quota number, having found the uncle in 
America.  I mean all of these -- years of waiti
ng and uncle Jacob said absolutely not. They 
argued and uncle Jacob had the same  resentme nt 
or appeared to have the same  resentme nt 
towards my father that  my mother had 
had.  I didn™t  show him great warmth. 
 

Q: Did you recognize him?  

 

A: Oh, of course, of course. So they argued a
nd finally uncle Jacob said to me , okay, it™s  her 
choice.  Of course I insisted on going toAmerica.
 We ll about a year late
r, my father followed 
me  and he knew where we were.  By the time  
he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not 

begun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in as
similating intoAmerican life, just like the 
chameleon I learned to be in the Ukraine. I di d, once again, of necessity, in the United St ates..  I 

had arrived here on June 24.  By September, I wa
s in school.  On my first day of school, I called 

the teacher outside and said to her somethi
ng like I am greenhorn, do not call on me , I will not 
answer. Wh en I am ready, I will raise my hand. Then you call me .  Shake? We  shook hands 

and she never called on m until I raised my hand onl
y a very short time later.  I reme mber the 
amaze me nt of the class and the round of appl
ause.  I even reme mber the question and the 
answer. 
 

Q: Garbotalks. 

 
A: Some thing like that. Anyway,suddenly my father shows up and he wants to take me  back -- he 
wants to ma ke an immi grant of me  a gain.  He 
doesn™t  speak a word of English, I™m going to be 
living again with displaced persons who™ve just
 arrived somewhere in Br ooklyn, where I have a 
life.  My name  is Berliner. I™m starting to ha
ve friends.  I speak E
nglish, I™ve grown, having 
gone from the smallest child in the class to the 
tallest, all in one seme ster.  I™m appearing in 
their amateur hour and wi nning a prize doing 
my krazotsky and singing Russian songs.  
Suddenly he wants to take me  -- he wants to turn the clock around, back to when I™m going to 
be da greena, look, the greena!Which was pejorati
ve.  Of course, 50 years of time have  turned 
the greena a pejorative into th
e survivor. This exalted, you 
know as if I did some thing 
phenomenal, I simply lived.  Just like that littl
e dress, that schmata that I™ve had for 50 years 
today became an artifact. 
 

Q: Just a dress. 

 

A: No, it was a schmata, trust me , a schmata.  No
w they have it hermetical
ly sealed or G__ knows 
what and it™ll be there for a thousand years 
or whatever, in a museum.  Oh my G__, it™s 
incredible what 50 years will do.  But there was 
my father and he wanted to undo the year of 
very hard adjustme nt.  So I said no.  He argued 
with my aunt and uncle.  I now was living with 
the rich uncle inAmerica and hisAmerican 
wife and going to school in Forest Hills, Long 
Island, P.S.3. My teacher was Mrs Riskin and th
e principal was Mrs. Morris.  My G__, how do 
you reme mb er all that Miki?  Anyway I didn™t wa
nt to go back with my father.  My father 
persisted and now my bi rthday came
 and my father sent me  a gift. Actually a very beautiful 
gift.A box of oil paints and brushes.  However 
he addressed it Mirka -- I still can™t  say it, his 

last na me  -- in care of Berlinrer.  I wa s mor
tified because the mail man knew and the doorman 
mi ght know.The girl who lived on the floor belo
w mi ght find out.  Everyone mi ght find out and 
oh my G___, it™s all going -- he™s 
going to turn it all around for me .  
They™ ll start to point at me  
again and I™ll be da greena again. And there 
was huge arguments between my aunt and uncle 
and my father who persisted. Then my uncle of
fered my father the -- he
 said he wanted to 
legally adopt me.  It didn™t mean that my father
 couldn™t have a relationship with me , we could 
have any relationship that we mutually wanted. 
 I could visit him, I c
ould go on a travel with 
him or whatever.  But he wanted to legally adopt
 me  to give me  the benefits of his moderate 
wealth andAmerican citizenship and so forth.  
Of course my father refused. The argume nts 
went back and forth.Then one day my father 
sent a letter which name
d a sum of mo ney for 
which he would sign the adoption papers. That caus
ed my aunt and uncle to tell him to get lost.  
Consequently, I was not adopted until I was 
21.  Now I already told you the story of the 
chocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the mont
hly packages and the family who ha d a child 
under ten received the added chocolat
e bar.  So my uncle Jacob registered me  as being a year 
younger.  Consequently, I was really, in fact, 22 
when I became  free to 
sign the papers myself 
and I became a citizen in that year.  I was 
also enga ged to my husband who gave me  an 
engageme nt ring on the very anniversary of my 
arrival in the United St ates which was June 24. 
 
Q: That was the anniversary______? 

 

A: Exactly, well yes, this is June 12.  It™s real
ly strange that so many events and things have 
happened to me  in June. Today was a wonderful
 day and a very beautiful weekend at which I 
have my family with me.  My husband, my dau
ghter Mural, my daughter-in-law,Gina and my 
sonAndy. We  are staying in a beautiful suite,in a lovely hotel inWa shington and the sun is 

shining. And I™ve survived the ordeal 
of this tape and life is wonderful. 
 
Q: Let™s hope it rema ins so. 
 

A: Thank you very much. 

 

Q: Thank you. This is still June 12, 1992 and we™re
 about to add a postscr
ipt to our interview. 
 

A: Ye s, a tiny anecdote which mi ght help to clarif
y the date.  My uncle a
nd I and his two suitcases 
were some where.  It was in the mi ddle of winter
 and we were in a tiny railroad station.  It 
wasn™t  a big city railroad station. There weren™
t platforms, you know train platforms.  It was a 
track and there was a little tiny bu
ilding and inside  the building it wa
s just one room s maller, or 
perhaps the size of this room which is 12 by 20 or 
15 or some thing like that
.  In the corner, there 
was a potbelly stove and there wa
s a desk and on the desk was one
 of those tick-tick machines, 
what is that? A telegraph, right.  Okay, thank you.There was a guy who sat huddled up next to 

the pot-bellied stove with this telegraph machine.
  In the back of the room, sitting on the fl oor, 
when we came in from a blizzard, walked into
 this building– I don™t know where we came  
from, I don™t reme mber how we got 
there.  I know it was a blizzard– 
 

Q: This was shortly afte
r you had been taken–? 
 

A: After he found me , okay, and we were going so
mewhere. We  were going to wait for a train.  
The train is going some where and we™re going to wait 
for a train.  It™s  night, it™s  a blizzard.  It™s  
night, it™s  cold, it™s  freezing. We  wal k from wh
at ever conveyance brought us to this station.  I 
reme mber seeing the little buildi
ng with the light  inside and so 
forth. Anyway we wa lk in, a 

blizzard of snow flies in with us . There™s this guy sitting at th
e desk and there are maybe half a 
dozen people who look like ruffians, me n, very
 rough looking characters
 sitting on the floor.  
Some  are smoking, and they are sort of loungi
ng on the floor on bundles, obviously waiting for 
the train. We  walk in and Jacob is very we
ll dressed and he has these two important looking 
suitcases and this little child 
all bundled up. We  walk in and 
there was one other item which I 
forgot, extremely i mportant. The guy at the desk
 has this telegraph m
achine and a small radio 
with a great deal of static and he
™s  listening to this radio. We  c o
me  in and we sit separate from 
these rough looking me n.  Jacob goes and talks to th
e ma n and explains to him that we want to 
get on the train. The ma n argues with Jacob a
nd says no, no, you can™t  get on the train. They 
argue back and forth.  Jacob offers him goods, what
ever, he™ll pay. The ma n says no, no.  Jacob 
says what about these me n?   N
o, they™re going to sit on top of th
e cars on the roof of the cars 
and you have a child and those boxes and you can
™t – Jacob pleads with him and suddenly the 
radio starts crackling and the ma n says, quiet, qu
iet, listen. They all 
listen and suddenly the 
me n jump up and run to the radio and they 
crowd around and I have no idea what is going on.  
The static and the men are all exci
ted and suddenly they all begin to
 cheer,Wa rsaw is liberated! 
 

Q: That would have been January 1945. 

 

A: G___ bless you, thank you so much.  Isn™t it wonderf
ul, it™s  so great. You see, I really belong in 
history! Anyway, Jacob opened one
 of his suitcases and he took 
out the most treasured of all 
the possessions, a bottle of vodka!We  passe
d it around, everybody drank from it, these 
ruffians– 
 

Q: Didyou? 

 

A: No.The ruff ians became  our best friends.  Sudde
nly in the mi ddle of this revelry, we heard the 
train, toot, toot. The train came and we all rush
ed outside and the ma n behind the desk said to 
Jacob, listen these me n are going on the roof.  Bu
t if you will do it, you can 
stand in front of the 
locomotive. There™s a little guardrail. You™ll st an
d, hold on to the guardrail. 
Your little girl will 
stand in front of you.  Put your coat around her. 
 Re me mber, we™ll tie the suitcases on front of 
the locomotive and reme mber you™re going to be
 heading directly into
 the storm.  I don™t 
guarantee that you won™t freeze to death but if you want
 this train, that™s it. We  got on the front 

of the locomotive.  Jacob -- I stood in front of
 him against the guardra
il.  Jacob™s coat was 
wrapped around me .  I leaned against him. The 
train took off into this blinding snowstorm and 
I don™t know where we went but we were happy. 
 

Q: You know this scene remi nds me  of you and 
your mother and David on the truck, not knowing 
where you were going. 
 

A: It™s the same , it™s the same.  But you see, I fit into
 this context of time, that™s so exciting!  I am 
so excited.   I can™t  tell you, it™s so
 important.  January 1945.  Fantastic! 
 

Q: How long had you been in this
 village?  You were liberated
 shortly before this date? 
 

A: Ye s, because  it was winter, it™s  all winter, right? 

 

Q: Ye s. You were there two and a half years? 

 

A: Yeah, 

 
Q: So that would have been, let™s see, some ti me  in ™42, summer. 

 

A: Summer of ™ 42.  My G___ it sounds like a m
ovie with Elvis Pr esley or some body, I don™t know, 
whatever. That™s it. 
 

Q: That was our anecdote and postscript. 

 

A: Thank you so much. 

 

A: Thank you so much. 

 

Q: Thank you so much again.
