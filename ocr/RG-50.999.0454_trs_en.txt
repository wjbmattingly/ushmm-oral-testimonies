W hen Nazi Germ any took over and divided Czechoslovakia in 1939, Botragy fell 
under Hungarian rule. Ireneand her siblingscouldnotattend school andherfather, along with 

thousands of other Jewish m en, were conscripted intoforced laborfor six months in 1942. In 
A p ri l

Herm an.  So thank you ver y, ver y m uch.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  I'm  glad to do it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have so much to tell us in such a short tim e, so we're just going to go 
right into the discussion that you're going tohave with us.
 
 
You describedf orm e the timefor you and yourf am ily in Czechoslovakia bef ore 
W o r ld
 
W ar II, bef orethe Holocaust,as atimeof  hard work but also a good lif e, one in which 
there was a sense of  safety, as youput it.  Before we turn to the war years, tell us about your 

fam ily and your community and you in thoseyears bef orethe war. 
 
>> I
reneW eiss:  Yes. W ell, we lived in a sm all f arm ing town, population 1,000.  Weknew our 
neighbors. W e weref riendly with everyone. My m other visited back andf orth and traded 

things with each other.
 
 
T here were six children in m y f am ily. W e were a very close fam ily.  My f ather had a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

business in anearby town.  Every day he cam ehom ef rom work it was a celebrationfor the 
children. Som etim eshe would bring us an exoticf ruit called an orange.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
It would be divided six wa ys, each child getting a piece. W e watched atthe 
ceremony of  peeling it.  No one thought they wanted more than their share. It was atreat.  

Sometimes he would bring a bar of chocolate, which was the same thing
;  
dividedsix ways.  
W e were delighted.
 
 
W eha d go o d t h i n gs  t o e
at because it was a farm ing town. W e had f resh f ruit from 
the trees.W ehad baked things that m y mother m adethat were fantastic.  But these were not 

usually thefoods thatwe got. 
 
 
My f atherdid things that in retrospect seem a little bit strange but i
t  wa s  ve r y 
normal. W hen we needed shoes
 
--
 t
hey sold them
 
--
 
there was a shoe store in thenearby 
town.  And insteadof  taking six children to the shoe store, he would take strings, m easure 
each of  our f eet, write
 
down thenam e who itwas, and he would go
 
to the shoe store and bring 
back these beautiful, shiny, patent leatherf orthe girls and lace
-
up shoesfor the boys.  I mean, 
it was just wonderful.
  
He was patient and caring and a hands
-
on f ather.  
 
 
My m other, she was busy with preparationof all the f oods that were done in the 
home.  Nothing was bought. T here were nobakeries or grocery stores.  So I, asa young girl, 
loved to watch the process of preparing food.  How is butterm ade? How is cheesem ade?  
How is the doughmadefor thebread? Things 
lik e  t h at
,  
I wouldfollow m y m other.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hings that today we wonder about.

>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. And then eat the results.  I rem em ber m y mother would give m e apiece 
of  dough,andI wouldm ake m iniature thingsof  the sam e things she m ade. T hen she would 
bake it.  And thenm y siblings and Iand som e little girlf riends wouldhave a 
te
a 
p
arty.  You 
know, bring our rag dolls out.
  
So it was a very norm al and happy life.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littlebit about your aunts, Roseand Pearl. T h
e y will f igu re  ve r y 
prom inently in what else you're going to tellus today, but tell usa little bit about them .
 
>> IreneW eiss:  My mother's two young sisters, they were in 
t h e i r mi d
-
20's.  Since I was only 
13 when this tragedy happened, up to thatpoint,
 
I calledthem AuntRose and Aunt Pearl. I 
looked up to them  as grown
-
ups, im portant young ladies.
 
 
Luckily, when m y sister and If ound ourselves in Auschwit z, alm ostthefirst week, 
thef irstfew days, we m et them there by chance. There were crowds of peopleand yet we 
som ehow recognized eachother.  So they took us into their barrack where they were.  I think 
because of their love, protection,and just the sense that we belonged to somepeople who 
loved us and we were not just sortof  the subhumansthat the Germans designated our status, 
it def initely helped me to survi ve.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And we're going to hearm uch more about that.
  
Irene,by the tim e Germany 
invaded Poland in September
 
1939, which startedW orld War II, bythattim e, however, your 
co
mm unity had already experienced profound change.  Hungary was an ally of Nazi Germ any.  
Andearlier in 1939, before Germ any invadedPoland, your com munity had beenoccupiedby 
Hungarians and that im mediately changed your lives.  Tell us about that time when the 
Hungarians began their occupationof  whereyou lived.

>> IreneW eiss: W ell, as you say, Hungary was allied with Germ any and they were im itating 
the way Germ any treated their Jewish population. T hey began tom ake laws to restrict all of 
our movem ents,ourf reedom s, all of our rights.  My f ather's business was conf iscated and 
gi ven to a non
-J
ew.  Icouldno longer go to school,to the Hungarian schools.
  
Soon after that, 
we had to wear a yellow star to identif y ourselves to all who wanted to m istreat 
u s.
  
T he laws 
were m a
de to take our f reedom s away 
and togi ve the police and the off icials in charge the 
right to dothat. So in such a circum stance the dangers are greatbecausethose who wantto 

do you harm  suff ernoconsequences.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heycoulddo it with impunity.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Andthey did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told us about a very earl y, f rightening experience you had with your 

father, Ibelieve, on a train.  
C an  y
ou tell a little bit about that? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, Jews af ter a while stoppedtaking trains and appearing in public 

because they were so vulnerable.  I was com ing home, just one stop f rom his place of where 
his business was backhome, ona train.  Hehad a small beard, which in those days identif ied 
him  as being Jewish.
  
T oday, as we know, men have beards and itdoesn'tm ean thatthey're 
Jewish or any other ethnic group. But som eyoung m en, I call them hoodlums, on the train sort 

of  recognized thathe's Jewish and they began tom akefunand tease and humiliate him . The
y 
were wondering what to do with him , should they throw him  off the train and wouldn't that be 
thefunthing to do. W ith him , I was probably 11,12,at thetim e
, a
 
terrif ying experience.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And no other passengers?

>> IreneW eiss:  Nobody lif ted af inger or said don't do that.  People justdidn'ttake the side of 
the Jewish people.
  
So luckily, what happened, it was just one stop that we had to go by the 
train and by the time they would have done that, the train stoppedand we got off . But we were 

ver y shaken.  Myf ather and m other, when he toldus back home, just ver y frightened and 
decided not to go on trains anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know how your parents, once yourfather lost his job, was forcedout of 

it, how your parentsmanaged
 
to m ake ends m eet
, h
ow they were able tof eed theirf am ily? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, his incom e stopped. They didn't know how long that would last. Six 

children. Theonly thing that really helpeduswas that it was afarm ing area and we grew our 
food and prepared thefood, so food was still ok but there weren't too many excursions to the 
shoe store 
o
r any other place. The childrenunderstood. W em adeno demands.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would continuefor several years living with circ um stances getting har
der 
andharder.  And in 1942, yourf ather
, 
alongwith thousands of other Jewish m en, weref orced 
by the Hungarians todo forced laborf or them ilitary.  T ell us what you know about yourf ather's 

conscription in the labor brigade and what that m eantfor you
r f am ily.  
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes,well, the m en were called intoforced labor. This was not being soldiers 

because Jews were not given guns or any kind of m ilitary training.  They were put in the 
f rontlines where thedanger was great.  Mostof  them never c
am e  b ac k .
 
 
It seem sthat during this early period when this started, the Hungarian governm ent 
still had some kind of  a compassionf orm enwho were older than 42 and had largefam ilies.  
Andaf tera certain length of  tim e,they released them . Som y father came back.  His beard 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

hadbeen shaved. W e children staredathim like a new stranger. W e didn't recognize him.
 
He satat home with no placeto goandno way to earn a living.  He helped aroundthef arm , 
the house.  
 
 
It was a very scar y tim e because we didn't know how long this woul d go on, hoping 
thatthe war would beover.  W eneverf elt that this strict isolation and discrim ination against us 

was going to last.  Som ehow we al ways had hope thatthis will pass, this is som e kindof a 
strange madness andthat it can't continue.  Unf ortunately things got worse. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Far worse.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Much worse.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So asdifficult as those tim eswere f or you, yourf amily, other Jews, under 
Hungarian rule, it turned suddenly dram atically and tragically worse in 1944 whenGermany 
invaded Hungary.  Tell us what happened once the Germ ans cam ein and what thatm eant for 
you and your comm unity.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. The Germ ans invadedHungary because Hungar y saw that the 

Germ ans were losing the war andthey decided to get outof  thealliance.  And becauseof that, 
Germ any invaded Hungar y.
 
 
T he way the Germansworked in the lands that they occupied is thef irst task was to 
collect the Jewish population andm ove them out into ghettos and then ship themf urther into 
cam ps of  various kinds in Polandand Germ any.
 
 
As soon asthe Germ an soldiersarrived
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem em ber them  com ing in.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

>> IreneW eiss:  Oh, Irem em ber them . T hey were welcom ed by the population. The Jewis h 
population 
f earedtheworst, but still we didn't know how bad
 
--
 
we still didn't understand their 
plan.W e hadnever heard of Auschwitz. W e had never heard of death camps.  W e still
 
--
 
f o r 
som e reason people don't want to acceptthe worst.  It's too diff icult. 
 
 
Th
ey beganfurther isolation basically to allow thepopulation to do what they 
wanted to do.  T hey gave them  perm ission to isolate, to hum iliate, to attack. W e had no 

recourse ina court of law.  You couldnotbring any kind of  law.  And if a gentile accuse
d a Jew 
of  anything, he was guilty im m ediately.  There was no way that he was ever innocent. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, itm eant thatyou were going to be,as you said, started tobe 

collected.  You weref orced into a ghetto.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e were collected.  We were made to move out of  our home with just very 

few possessions.  Bef ore we lef tourhouse, adelegation of off icials came toourhouse and 
toldm y f atherto give them money, jewelr y, any valuables that we had because they 
demanded it.  He did give them  some. And then we were m arched out of ourhom e.  Closed 
the gate. W ehad pets, anim als, closedthe gates
;  
so they won't follow us.  
 
 
W e were taken to a place, kind of a hall. T heother Jewish f am ilieswere arri ving, 
too, with their chil
dren and belongings.  Everybody had a place on the floor.  The local officials 
together with this tim e Germ an officials had them en com e in individually into theiroff icesand 

they cruelly threatened and dem anded to give  them m ore valuables
;  
that we musthave more 
and we should give them . W e were totally terrif ied. W e understoodnow that we were in the 

hands of people whohad the law ontheir side todo whatever they wanted with us.  It's aver y 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

terriblef eeling.  To have peoplebe yourenemies.  In other
 
words, other human beings totreat 
you like that.
 
>
> Bill Benson:  Notonly be your
 
enem ies, but as you say
,  
to have total control to do asthey 
want.  If  I remember correctly, your head was shaved while you were  in the ghetto.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e were taken to the ghettos in the nearest large city where people, the 
Jewish f am iliesf rom  the region, were there, som ething likem orethan 10,000 people.  Yes, at 
this point
 
--
 
again, wewere cro wded together.  Always a place on thef loorfor everyone 
whether they were sick or oldor pregnant wom en, children, everybody on thefloor
 w
it h  a ll of  
our belongings.  
 
 
Yes, so there was anannouncem ent that girls  should report to a certain place to 
have their head shaved.  It was alwa ys a threat.  Yourfather will be beatenand punished if you 
don'tdo it.  So Ididn'teven tell m y mother.  Ijust appearedat this place. I had long braidsat 
the tim e.  Cutm y hair.  I cameback
,  
andm y m other gave m e a scarfto cover m y head.
 
 
Religious Jewish wom en coveredtheir heads 
t yp ic a lly.  
 
And m y m other wore a 
scarf  on her
 
head always.  So atthis point I didn't look like a 13
-
year
-
old teenager.
 
T hings,evenf or a child, becam e less and less im portant.  You lowered your standards and 

expectations on whatwas im portant.  It didn't
 
botherm easm uch as it botheredm y m other it 
seemed. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Itm ust have brokenher heart.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, in the early spring to the early summ er of 1944 when the Germ ans 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
cam e, Hungary hadthe last largestpopulation of  Jews lef t in all of Europe. T he numbers of  
those that were deported is staggering.  Can you say a little bit about that?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Well, inthis place where they ghettoized the Jewish people, trains 

arrived.  It was a brickfactory thathad a railroad sidingf ortheir own purposes.  Oneday this 
ver y long cattle train, cattle cars, arrived andannouncements were m ade that we shouldall 
headf or thetrains, get in. T here was shouting, yellin g, pushing. W e were all pushed in,m any 
in t o
 
a car, the train car
; d e
stination unknown. Nobody said where we were going or how long 
the trip wouldbe.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had no idea?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Absolutely no idea.W etried ver y hard toevery m em ber of  thefam ily to get 

into the same ca
r, stick to ge the r, stay to ge ther.  It wa s a lre a d y d iff icult.  
 
 
Af ter the train was lockedf rom  theoutside,af ter a while it m oved. There was 
silence and terror in these cars.
  
W e hadheard rum ors that the Jews in Poland were being 
executed in thef orests; that they would just be shot in large groups.  So we assum ed that 

som ething like that is going to be happening to us.W e didn't know any other destination.
 
 
W hen the trainm ovedand m y father was able to lookup, look outof the small 
windo w, he at one
 
point said that the train reared towards Poland.
 
>> Bill Benson: T owards Poland.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  And so I rem em ber the tremendous
 
--
 
the Jewish people, wom en, children, 
ever yone, are shot down in theforest.  Nobody cared.  Nobody kept track of who was 
dead 

and who was alive.

>> Bill Benson:  And your entiref am ily was in  that boxcar with you.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes
, m
y f ather, mother, and six children. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter a periodof  tim e the train arrives at its destination.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. It arrived at a place where looking out the window or when thedoor was 
opened;
 
we saw barracks, guard towers,f ences, wired fences. W e saw prisoners in striped 
unif orm s.  Everybody calm ed down.  The grownups said thatthis looks like a labor camp of  

s o m e 
kind, a work camp, and this is not theforest in Poland. W e see other prisoners, so it 
seemed like possible to survi ve such a thing.
 
 
Again, we hadno ideawhere we were and neither did we know that the very next 
step was cruel andharsh and heartbreaking
 
because they shouted and scream ed instructions:  
w
om en to one side,men to the other. So imm ediately m y father and 16
-
year
-
old brother and 
otherm en lined up on one side.W e never saw them  again. T he wom en and children and 

elderly are in another group.
  
 
 
As the platform was f illed with people,the train,m aybe 2,000 people at a time, the 
crowd was m oving up to thef ront. W edidn'tsee thef rontuntil we were upfront inf rontof  
about 12 Nazi soldierswith dogs, beautif ully dressed inboots, very threatening with thedogs.  
Andone of them  wasm akingm otion that separated peoplef rom each other with am otion of a

on. I assume hem istook me f ora young wom an, sohetook m y sister away f romme and 
m ade her go towardswhere the younger children and women wentandm adem e go to where 
m y older sister went, which seemed to be theyoung adults. 
 
 
So, again, Inever saw them  again.  I went towards where m y sister went.  She was 
wa y up the road with a bunch of other youngadults.  I was yelling after her to waitf orm e.She 
f inally heardm e,turned around.  She says, "W hydidn't you go with m om ?" 
  
W ell,  go in g wit h  
m om  andthe children,that group that was selectedf rom  the train went straight to the gas 

chambers.W ithin a half
-
ouror so they were all dead. T he crem atorium s wouldburn their 
bodies. T he next train would com e, and thenext group of  wom en and children and elderly.  

T he chim neys were belching f ire,not just sm oke.  
 
 
And later onm y sister andI andm y two aunts, whom  we m et there, were assigned 
to work at aplace where, again,nobody ever told you what will happen but we f oundourselves 
in a place that was im m ediately next to the gas cham ber number 4.

the rest of  yourf am ily are gone.  You told me about 
this extraordinary book that was published that captures the very day you were there.  
C an  y
ou 
say a little bitabout that?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Well, there isa book that you can buy here inthemuseum  bookstore 

andelsewhere. W henthe Hungarian Jews were being deported toAuschwitz, it was done
 
in  
great haste because the war was com ing to an end. As you said, this was the largest group of  

Jews rem aining in Europe.  So the Germ ansputextra eff ortand hastened to com plete the job

on genocide.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because they're losing the war.
 
>> I
reneW eiss: T hey're losing the war.  In six weeks they deported something like400,000 
fam ilies,people, Jewish people, to Auschwit z
; s
ome elsewhere, butm ostly to Auschwitz.
 
For some reasonthey decided to photographtheir eff iciency of  handling all of  this large group.  
Ordinarily they didn't want to have a record of their deeds, but they assigned two soldiers to 
takepictures. So these peopletook picturesof  every step of the train arriving, the separation, 
theprocessing later, the people walking to the gas cham bers.  Everyt hing was photographed.  
 
 
Something like 25 years later thesephotographs surf acedand albums were made 
outof  itfor sale.  My daughter boughtm e one of those album s.  I went throughevery page with 
a magnif ying glass.  I was just
 
stunned that it was exactly the way o f  whathappened tous.  
And I thought
:  
I couldnever explain this to anyone, buthere is thepicture exactly the way it 
wa s .   
 
 
So inf lipping through pages, hoping to recognize people that I knew orf amily, I 
actuall
y foundm yself  in it as I was standing there afterm y sister wa s separated f rom m e and I 
was m otioned to go totheother side. I didn'tleave im mediately.  I stood theref oran instant 
looking to wherem y yo unger sister went.  I was devastated to see
 
--
 t
o think that in the 
m om ents thatpassedshe would no longer catchup with m y mother.  And the crowds wer e 

m oving f ast.  I justfelt that this little girl wi ll be lost in the crowd.  Ihung there to see, leaning a 
little bit towards where she went. I couldn't see where she went. T here were barriers.  Butm y 
picture was taken,and I recognized m yself  wi th the scarf .

several ghetto

enlarged. 
 
 
Further searching the book,f or days anddays, m any pages,m anycrowds, som eof

>> Bill Benson:  So, Irene, you're with your sister Serenaand you have really a chance 

encounter with your aunts.  Tell us about that.  Then you began to tell us where you were sent, 
the work you were required to do.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Well, when we met our two aunts,

and as Isay, they were to us like 
older adults althou
gh Irealize they were not thatm uch older. T hey treated us liketheir 
children. They ref erred tous "the children, the children."  Tom e, I had this moral support. I 
hadthis love of som ebody who caredf orm e. It was a very f rightening place of, you k

Hungarian Jews, theycame day and nighton thetrains

here wasa backupof  the gassing.  
So there would be people waiting their turn, sitting
 
on the road with their children, looking at us

Again, you see

I would stand by the window and I would see them .  I would see
 
all of  these little children, all agesf rom inf ants to little kids and their m others, grandm others.  I 

see them  walk into the gate, and I hear the next train com ing up, nottoofar.  I hear the train, 
thehissing of  the engines and so on. And I just have
 
to look up the roadand I see thenext 
huge crowd is com ingand yet I didn't have the kindof emotion that I should have had.  Idid 

not cry.  I did not know how to absorb it.  Idid notunderstand that that's happening. T here 
was a totaldenialeven though I saw it clearly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were 13 years old.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.  And yet there was something very wooden about the wholething. This 
can't be happening.  This isn't true. T his isnot going on.  And,of  course, I knew that m y fam il

baby carriages, eyeglasses.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatever peoplehad carriedwith them .
 
>> IreneW eiss:  From toothbrushes, whatever household things,depending onhow long they 
hadbeen outof  their hom es. T his stuff justaccum ulated.  It was f irst broughtf rom the platform  
anddum pedbetween the barracks where we worked.  It accumulated ashigh as the roof  of 
the barracks.  There were 
shoes all the way up to the roof , all sizes, all shapes, all kinds of 
household belongings.  These things the Germ ans assigned a thousand womenand about a 

thousand men in another section where the stuff  hadtobe sortedout, separated into types, 
and brou
ghtunder roof,f irst of all, and thenf urther separated, labelstaken off, and shipped 
back to Germ any f or the use of the Germ an people.

the Germ an soldiersassigned to guard us and in charge of us, they took 
thebestof everything and sent them hom eto their wi ves.  There were things likef ur coats, 

perf um es, you know, elegant pocketbooks.  Depending on whatever people had, it was all 
beautif ul things and valuable.
  
So we worked in day shif tsand night shifts to sort these things 
outand put them in categories.  It was shipped back toGermany. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the guards helped them selves to the best.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Helped them selves to the best. T hey brought in400,000 people of every 

social level.  Sothe amountof  stuff that we worked with, just thenum ber of shoes and

Auschwitz was, ok, depravations and all of that,butIworked therefor 
possibly about eightmonths and it was a world unrecognizable in the civili zed world.  The 
trains arrived. T he peopleare sorted out.They're m arched and killed. T heir bodies are 
burned. And the next train is com ing and thenext train is com ing. W here is thisplace? W hat 
kind of

this cannot be in Europe.  This cannotbeanywhere on the earth. And I as a child 
fantasized that Ihave no idea where this is, nobody cares, and this is some kind of other world 

thatthis is allowed and little children arem urdered on arrival andm others. Itm adem efeel 
thatI was in aparallel universe of  som e kind. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, as you described, youhad some protection by your two auntsfor you 
andSerena. You were at risk because you were so young. Even though you had survived the 
selection to go with the older adolescents and wom en, you were still at risk.  Didn't your aunts 
protect you in that regard, too? 
 
>> Irene W ei
ss:  Oh, yes. T heir eff iciency toget rid of  children, their determ ination, was 
com pletebecause it seem s tom e if you're talking of genocide, they don't wanta new 
generation to grow up. So theyf ocused in onchildren and child baring wom en, particularl

So there would be reselecting of those they m ight havem issed.  Ever y single day when we 

were lined uptobe counted
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just in case they m issed a child.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Andthey would pull out children. I was vulnerable daily.
 
 
So  d
uring the counting where they would lineupf ive in a row, m y two aunts would 
position me ina mostadvantageous position so when they looked down, they wouldn't see the

>> B ill B

>> IreneW eiss: T o appear taller.  Never thefirst oneand soon. Luckily it worked, but we 
were aware daily wher e

I was 13 years old.  It was def initely the youngest. T hey wouldbe 
pulledout.  And very often they were with
 
a mother.T he mother would just volunteer to go. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T o gowith her daughter.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. This was adaily

they would even com e intothebarracks and look 
into thebunks where we were, you know, sleeping andpull out young peo
ple or
 
e lde rly, to o. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, you would continue,as you said,for eightm onths,but in January
 
1945 
as the Soviets were advancing you were forced out.T hey evacuated Auschwit z
-
Birkenau and 
you were sent on what is known as a DeathMarch.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, indeed it was a deathm arch. T he Russian Arm y was approaching 
Auschwitz.  T hat was in Poland.  Instead of allowin g the rem aining survi vors there tobe 
liberated, the Germ ans decided to evacuate the cam p.  Ithinkthe purpose of that
 
was to 
reduceour num berfurther.  It was January, bitter cold, and they m arched us outof  the camp.  

T here was some discussion am ong us prisoners whether we should stay andhide, would that 
be a better way.  Andm y little group,m y aunts and others,decided, look, the gates are open; 
let's get out of here.  The Germ ans will burn this place down asevidence. We're not likely to 
survi ve here.  So we went with the crowd.
 
 
I understand that som e num berof people didstay.  It took about 10days af ter the 
ca m

at any rate, we went.  It was an incredible, cold winter. W ewalked through the snow, 
the rain, and the cold for days and nights and slept in the gutters. If you sat down, you wer e 
shot. Simpleas that. The road was thef illed with deadpeople. Even if somebody hadtolean 
on you or something, if they had an idea thatyou couldn't make iton your own, you were s hot. 
 
T hey didn'tprovide any food, any water. W eate the snow on the ground. 
 
 
Af ter a while, af terdays and nights, they putus into open cattle cars
, d
ragged us 
further into Germany, into camps. The camps along the way were f illed up by all of  these 

prisoners thatthey wer e evacuating andmovi ng away f rom  the approachingf ront.
 
>> Bill Benson: T aking them deeper into Germ any.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Deeper.  So they took us into

So m y Aunt Pearl

atonepoint, the train stopped. T hey were steam  engines.  
T hey were f illing the engines up with water. W eheard the gurgling and gushing of  the water.  

W ehadn't hadany water.  Ourm ouths were dry.  T he tongue wouldn't m ove.  
S h e h ad  a c up  
in her hand. She just kind of im pulsively got upf rom  thef loor and attem pted todangle the cup 

over the sidef or water.  And each carat thatpointhad a Nazi

designated guard with us right 
there in the car. It was a wom an.  She got up and
 
began tobeat her viciousl y.  She cut her 
head open, bleeding, because she attem ptedto get som e water. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Get adrink of  water. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  So we knew not todothat anym ore.

Glewe.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Asour tim e is getting short, Iwant you to be surethat you can tellus about 
your tim e thereand wit h your aunts.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. W ell, the system broke down here, even what system  the Germans 

had. T here was real starvation here. W e were theref orf ivem onths.  My sister and Ibecam e 
ver y em aciated. My Aunt Pearl becam e sickwith T yphus. T hey took her away to a plac
e 
where there was a gas cham berand killed her. W eknew thetruck cam e periodically to take 

the sick out of  there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So she had gone, asI rem em bertoan inf irm ary but you knew
 
--
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Shewent to an inf irmary because shehadT yphus. T he inf irm ary usually 
served for them to get the sickand take them out. T hey had the inf irm ary, but it was notfor 
curing or helping.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you knew that.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e knew that,but we couldn't help it. She had tohave a place to be because 
we were all on thef loor stepping over each other.
  
So we saw her be taken away.  T hen they 
continuedthe selection.  So one day m y sister was selected. W e knew exactly whatf or. The 

truck was going to come.  I at this pointhad lost one aunt, the otherone was also very sick.  I 
said, "I am her sister." So the guy said,"
O
k,you can go, too."  So they locked us into a room  
with people who were so em aciated
 
and run down.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou said I'm  her sister, you knew that was a

whole thing of  I had this protectionf rom m y aunts,m y sister, but it was all gone.  It was just 
incredibly f rightening to me. I just wanted tobe with her wherever she went.
 
 
So there were other wom en looking like us in this room .W e were therem ost ofthe 
day.  Atonepoint somebody tried the door and it gave, and so everybody kind of  sneakedout 
and wentbackto our barracks
.  I
t woul
d seem  that because of  the chaos of  th
e war that was 
happening nearby
 
the truck didn't arrive that day.  So we lived another day. 
 
 
Af ter that, very shortly, the Russian soldiers did arrive. W e looked out oneday and 
the guard tower was em pty.  W e waited to see if  it wasf or real.  Som ebraver wom en would go 

to the big gateand push it, and it gave.  And that's how we knew that we were f ree,that the 
Germ an guards were gone.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they were just gone.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Just gone.  Nobody m ade any announcem ent.  And we didn't rush out the 
gate.

happened when the Russians arrived? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, they ignored us.  Camps were set up inhospitals,f ood, soon, 
transportation.  But with us,nothing. T he Russian soldiers showedup andthey lef t. T he next 
tim e we saw them  is when we dared to go out of  the camp and walk up the roadandf ounda 
nearby town.  Aperf ectly norm al town, German houses. T he populationalso ran very m uch 
af raid of the Russian Arm y.  T hey had good reason to be af raid, butwe have to remember 
what the German Army did to the Russian civil ian population whenthey were over there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were literally now on your own.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e were on ourown.
 
>> Bill Benson: W as Serena still with your other aunt?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Actually, we put her, my other aunt, into this little town's hospital.T his 
was a real hospital.  Because she had raging fever
, s
he just couldn't keep up with us hanging 
around where we were  and just waiting.  So we didput her in there.
  
Now, they had nothing 
really either. T hey had a bed.T hey had abed and apparently some tea which was m ore than 
bef ore.  So we stayedaround in thetown.
 
 
T he Russian soldiersnever offered usany kind of food. They had their own place
 
where they were.  Somebody told us, well, go over there; that's where the soldiersare and 
they're beingf ed. So I rem em ber going with som e others. W esaw them  eating. T hey wer e 
being served their m eal.  At theend som ebody cam e to the gateand said there was nothing

So we really had no help.  But the worst thingwas that we had nohelp in

 b
ecause Germ any's transportation was

a f te r I 
got m y aunt out of the hospital, we 
started walking towards somewhere. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you would eventually f ind your wa y in Prague,Czechoslovakia.  How did 
you get there?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Again, there was a rumor
:  g

; t
hereare trains there.
  
Go there. There 
are buses there.  And the roads weref illed with ref ugees just walking hereand there, trying to 

get outof  there. 
 
 
So actually we went to a town
 
--
 
Czechoslovakia actually did send som e buses to 
pick uptheir citizens, a certainplace.
  
And after staying there quitea while som ebuses did 
show up, andthey wer e mobbedby people, not just Czech,anyone
, i
n and out of the windo

the roof ,everything, just hanging on.  Again,we're f ighting, all of us, getting in there.  It drove 
us to P

notbeingf ed, notbeing taken care of until wef ound ourselves in Prague.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto ask youto tell usone more thing before we formally end the program
 
today.  Youdescribed to mef inally getting back to your home. W ill you share that with us?

a young uncle, about 20 years old, cameback.  He hadbeen in

already toldus but the m any things that we haven't heard, including thefact that you stayed in 
Czechoslovakia f ortwo years before you had theopportunity to come tothe United Statesand 
begin a new lif e.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being heref or
 
First  P e rson

going to ask you to all stand because ourphotographer, Joel, is going to get aportraitof  Irene, 
if  youdon't m ind, with you all standing in thebackground.  So if  you

ask you todothat.  And then Irene will step off the stage. W e didn'thave tim e today for you to 

ask questions
, b
ut if any of  you want to just com eupand hug her orsay hi or ask her a
