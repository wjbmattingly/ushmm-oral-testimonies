HENRY PLITT 
November 16, 1992 
 
Q: Could you please tell us your name
 and where and when you were born? 
 
A: Henry G., G for George, Plitt. I was born 
in New York City in 1918 and that, of course, 
was late in the year that year, just  two 
weeks after the Armi st
ice for World War I. 
 

Q: And where were you educated? 

 

A: I started in New York Cit
y, and I went to grammar school 
there, and one year at DeWitt 
Clinton High School, after which my  fa mily sent me  to a military academy in Stanton, 

Staunton, Virginia. It's spelled St aunton. It's
 pronounced Stanton and there I began my 
military career. 
 

Q: And you stayed at the military 
academy through the end of high school? 
 

A: Well, I graduated from Staunton in 1935 at wh
ich time I went to Syracuse University and 
there I went in the ROTC, so again we've got 
another three or  four years, three years of 
military and I was eligible to become an offi
cer by then with six years of military under 
my belt, but I wasn't  old enough. In those da
ys you had to be twenty-one to be... 
 

Q: Anofficer... 

 

A: A lieutenant. So that began my relationship 
with the army. Now I was in law school in St. 
Lawrence University, Brooklyn, and at this ti
me ...it was getting clos
e to 1940...it was in 
'38 and '39, and my fa mi ly ma naged through an
 organization called HI
AS to bring into 
this country some of my relatives who were
 in the German oc cupied areas and when 
I...when I heard their story, I just ma de up 
my mi nd that all this was...one ma n was 
responsible for all this and his name was H
itler and somehow or other I wanted to ki ll 
him. Now that sounds terrible 
in the light of today's worl
d, but at that time  when you 
heard those horror stories, you couldn't  do a
nything but want to destroy this person who 
was responsible for it, so I switched my a
llegiance in the army to parachute troops 
because at that time  parachute troops were 
trained to blow up bridges, bl ow up planes, 

drop behind the lines, assassinate, execute 
and all this kind of 
thing. But during our 
period of training, it was very strange but
 ma ny, ma ny peopl e came into parachute troops 
and before the training was over, we suddenl
y had ourselves a a regime nt of me n and 
now the tactics were not going to be the sa
me. The regiment, incidentally, grew into 
divisions, and by the time we jumped in Norm
andy there were three divisions that went 
in. There was the 101st, the 82nd and the Bri
tish 36th Airborne, so you can see that the 
idea of jump ing behind the lines and killing Hi
tler was a long way fr
om potential fruition. 
It just couldn't  happen that way, so that's th
at's  an answer to your question and when did I 
get in the army or how or why.

Q: Now we won't focus on this. I know you have 
a ve ry interesting aspect of your military 
career in terms of the landing at Normandy. Co
uld you briefly tell us a little bit about 
that...what...what exactly your role wa s? 
 
A: Well, all...all I can tell y
ou is that the only reason...it was 
a quirk of fate...the only reason 
that I ended up with the fi rst group to jump in
 Normandy is the man that we had selected 

as our pathfinder, the day before during the period Eisenhower delayed for twenty-four 

hours, we had a chance to go up and see what he
 had done, and we were very dissatisfied 
with it and my colonel said to me  on the wa
y back, Plitt, I want you to go in. Take the 

pathfinder detachme nt in and I'll me et you on the ground and put a DSC on your neck. So 

I... 
 

Q: Distinguished Service Cross? 

 

A: Yes. So I didn't have any choice anyway, but
 the point is that th
at put me among...we had 
three airplane loads going in, 
the pathfinders, a total of ei
ghteen people per plane for a 
total of fifty-four people. And now the actua
l flight itself over 
England was nothing but 
when we got to the English Channel, we went down on the deck and there were some  

very exciting mo me nts when the ships at sea were fl ashing the V for victory sign to us 

right over...right over head a
nd then when we got to Cherbourg we pulled up to five 
hundred feet. Imagine...up to five hundred feet 
and we went along the line, the road that 
we had all been briefed so carefully on a
nd studied so long, running from Montberg to 
Valone...from Cherbourg to Montberg to 
Valone on down to St. Mere-Eglise and 
Carentan and so on. And when we got over our
 drop zone, boom...there
 it is. Now if you 
want to know what went through my  mi nd, I 
was just as scared as any huma n being 
01:02:  could be. Here I was jumping into Fe
stung (fortress) Europe, which was a Nazi 
domi nated Fr ance, German soldiers, and I 
had an H on my dog tag. Now the H on my 

dog tag stood for Hebrew. At that time the 
ar my  put your religion on your dog tags and 
they did it only so that if you need last ri
tes or what have you, they know what you are 
and what you aren't , and they only had three cat
egories. There was P for Protestant, C for 
Catholic and H for Hebrew or 
Jewish, and so there I was, all alone, in France, German-
occupied, so the first thing I did (coughing)...exc
use me...in an attempt to get mobile or as 

mobile as I could, was to scrap the throwawa
y things that were weighing me  down, such 
as a gas ma sk and such as binoculars a
nd such as extra rounds of a mmunit i on, and 
suddenly I got so I could move around with a 
great degree of ease, 
and during this period 
I was able to pick up a hundred and one
 me n. Strangely enough, we were the 101st 
Airborne. I picked up a hundred and one me
n and we attacked the gun position, which 
was the division mi ssion. Now the reason we did 
that is that we we
re supposed to be on 
the ground for thirty mi nutes, and after that 
hearing our own planes come  in, we would 
put the lights on. That's  what we jumped fo
r...the pathfinders...put 
the lights on and guide 
the rest of the units in. For a 
long time, it got to be very th
in and tight and for a long time 
I thought ma ybe Eisenhower has canceled again, 
in which case we got to stay here for 
twenty-four more hours and sweat 
it out, or...and before the or 
really had a chance to take 
hold, we could hear the drone of airplanes co
mi ng over. For our whole, the first part of 
the mi ssion, the pathfinder mi ssion was worthl
ess, because these were new pilots who 

had never flown in combat before and when 
the anti-aircraft started comi ng up at them, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181

they broke fr om for mation. They dropped troops in the Channel. They dropped them all 
the way north to Cherbourg and all the way s
outh to Carentan, and so that part of the 
mi ssion just wasn't . 
 

Q: But you still were one of the first ones to... 

 

A: Well, yeah. I was in the first fifty-four. 

 

Q: I want to move now to your role in a very
 important historical mo me nt that you had and 
that's in the capture of...in the apprehensi
on and the capture of two ma jor figures in 
Nazi...the Nazi rule of Germany and in the 
destruction of the Je
ws, and I understand the 
first one you captured was Robert Ley.  
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Could you tell us about that? 

 

A: Yeah, it's a very interesting story. We  had an
 arrangement with the Burgermeisters of the 
various cities, that if they had any known 
what would later become  termed as war 
criminals, in their area, they were to notif
y us. If they intended 
to hold their job as 
Burgerme ister, they better do it. And so we
 got a call one night. I don't know who was  on 
the board...got a call from a Burgerme ister tell
ing us about this ma n that was living in a 
certain building. We went to the building a
nd we entered the place that he was supposed 
to occupy and he did. He was in bed and the mi nute we came in the door, he reached for a 

pill on hi s night tabl e, and one of my boys knoc
ked it out of his hand, and then he said he 
didn't know why we were bothering him. He 
was a professor, a teacher. Hi s name was  
Disselbruger (ph) and he...what can I tell 
you...he claime d to have...he never was a Nazi, 
knew nothing about Nazism and so on. Now I ha ve to take you back for a mo ment. When 

VE Day came around, which was May the 8th, my
 particular unit of the 101st Airborne 
was in an area occupied by 13,000 SS troops. No
w there we were, two thousand, now in 
charge of.,,these people had surrendered, so
 we took blocks where they put their 
weapons, and blocks where they did this, but 
in order to control these 13,000 people, we 
had to get MP's...that's mili
tary police...from their own 
units. We...we...we just didn't 
have the ma npower to do this, so we did th
at, and in my hea dquarters was a full colonel 
Nazi. At that time I was only a cap...I was a ma jor. In our headquarters there was a full 

colonel Nazi, and when I walked in with Di
sselbruger, he clicked his heels, popped to 
attention and said Heil. Now how in the hell
 can a school teacher have a full colonel do 
this, so I called division h
eadquarters and I said I'm sending this guy up to you. And I did, 
and he turned out to be Robe
rt Ley, the Minister of Labor, 
the guy who sent people to the 
camps and what have you. That
's  the Robert Ley story. 
 

Q: That's a fascinating stor y. So
 his subordinate gave him away?  

 

A: Well, yeah, you could call a full colonel his 
01:04:  subordinate, but once you knew that 
he was senior to a full colonel, you knew you had some thing. But I didn't know who he 

was.

Q: Now you also had a very important role in
 the apprehension and 
the capture of Julius 
Streicher, who was the leading propagandist , anti-Semitic propagandist  for the Nazi  

move me nt... 
 

A: Well, that that was a more solita
ry role because I got him by myself. 
 

Q: Could you tell us about  how that came  about? 

 

A: We also got a tip that there was a a high ra
nking Nazi living in the town of Wi dering (ph) 
in Austria and his name  we didn't know. Ithought it was Heinrich Himmler from the 

description, but I didn't have a jeep of my ow
n and I didn't have an interpreter of my own 
at the time, so I borrowed another guy's jeep 
and his driver and the three of us went up 
the hill to this house, ch
alet, chateau, whatever you want 
to call it, and I entered, my 45 in 
hand, and I went upstairs. There was a ma n s
itting on a chair with an easel to his right 
painting the opposite Alp, and I asked him his na
me  and he told me  Joseph Seeler (ph), 
and I said where's your identification papers, 
and he reached right in ba ck and he pulled 

out an identification paper ma de out to the 
name  of Joseph Seeler. Now it didn't hit me  
quite that fast that this was Julius Streic
her, and I began asking him things about 
Hi mmler, because I thought I had the wr
ong guy, and he said he knew nothing about 
politics. He was a painter. He knew nothing ab
out anything that had to do with what I 
was interested in and then I don't know why I 
said, and what about Julius Streicher, and 
he said: "Ja, der bin Ich.ﬂ Now I got th
at only from the J S on his work papers. 
 

Q: JS? 

 
A: Joseph Seeler was Julius Streicher. "Ja, de
r bin Ich", which when translated into English 
reads yes, that's  who I am. Now we had no furt
her interrogation. In the car, in the jeep on 
the way, he and I were in the back. I had my
 gun riding his ribs so nothing was going to 
happen there. He wasn't  going to jump out or
 commit suicide or anyt
hing, and I said to 
him...this is the only interrogati
on he got from me ...I said to 
him:  "Sind Sie der Streicher 
der war gegendie Juden?", which when transl
ated means, are you the Streicher who was 
against the Jews. And he very calmly said: "J
a, der bin Ich", which me ant yes, that's who 
I am, but he mi ght just as well have said so 
what. I mean he was arrogant to the very end, 
so much so t hat when we got to Berc
htesgarten...oh, I'm sorry...I stopped at my 
regime ntal headquarters to notify them I wa
s bringing him in and Bertchesgarten was 
about forty miles away from us. When I got to
 Bertchesgarten, as he
 was getting out of 
the jeep, I booted him a little bit so that acc
elerate his departur e, and the pl ace was loaded 
with reporters and this, that 
and the other, and one reporter 
came  up to me and he said, 
you know, you just killed the greatest story 
of the war. I said how. He said can you 
imagine if a guy name d Kohn or Goldberg or
 Levy had captured this
 arch-anti-Semite, 
what a great story it would be. I said why. 
He said because a Jew would be doing this, 
and I told him I'm Jewish, and that's when the mi crophones came  into my  face and the  
cameras started clicking away and 
things started to happen that 
changed the rest
 of my life. 
 

Q: Did you have any chance to interr
ogate him further or after that... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181  
5 
 
 
A: No. They took him. I took him to division 
headquarters. They took him on up to Munich 
where the army interrogation team was. When
 I say army that's a division of like a 
regime nt or battalion army, and th
at's where those people we re.  
 

Q: How did you feel capturing Ley a
nd even and capturing Streicher? 
 

A: Well, with Ley I just  felt it was a part 
of my job and because there was no di rect 
relationship between Ley and 
Streicher and between Ley and and what was going on in 
Europe and Germany at the time , but with Stre
icher there was a very direct relationship. 
With Ley I didn't even go to division with hi
m. I sent him up with a couple of my men 
because I didn't...we didn't know then that it 
was Ley either, you know, but I sent  him up 
with a couple of my men and 
with Streicher there was a ve
ry personal feeling about the 
whole thing. I can tell you my
self not killing him from time to time when I had the 
opportunity, but I had two other people in the 
jeep and war or not war you just don't kill 
people who surrendered, so that's 
the story of Julius Streicher. 
 

Q: That's  an important story. You also had part
icipated I guess earlier than this in the entry 
into Dachau. 
 

A: Oh yes. That was... 

 

Q: Could you tell us about that? 

 

A: Well, that's...that's a mo ment that will will
 live forever. The most outstanding mo ment of 
this whole thing, and I'll never forget the 
word was as we got in there and it was a 
horrible sight...everything was,  huts they live
d in, the furnaces that they we re burned in, 
and which incidentally were 
01:06:  crematoriums and as 
we got there, moving up into 
this area, one of the me n I was with said l
ook at those crematoriums, and another officer 
standing next to him said no, it's crematoria. Th
at's the plural for crematoriums. I'll never 
forget that because that whole mo ment was 
just unbelieva ble. These people were sitting 

on stoops and porches and on the ground. Their b
odies were totally emaciated. Their legs 
were swollen. It was...it was an unbelievable ti
me and the very same  date that we went 
through stands there today because I've been ba
ck and it's just...it's a mo ment that is very 

di ffi c u l t  t o  de s c r i be . 
 

Q: Do you remember the exact day on which you entered? 

 

A: No, I don't. I reme mber May 8th, you know. I'
ve  got those dates, but I can't  give you the 
exact day, but I can tell you that about two w
eeks before...maybe ten days before the 8th 
of May, I saw people walking on the road 
wearing what we later found out was the 
uniform of the inmates of the 
the concentration camp, but I had never seen that before...a 
pajama  looking thing with a blue and a grey. 
And I said what the hell is this. They got 
another army here we don't know a bout. They 
were walking along the road, and this is in 
the Alps, but as you got into areas like Muni
ch and what have you, you were getting into 
the areas of these camps and how and why th
ey were out I can't  tell you, but they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181

out there and not with a guard, because the 
guard would have been a German. We  would 
have shot him. We  woul
d have had a fire fight. 
 
Q: Had you been prepared by the army or anyt
hing you had read or information for what you 
would see in the camps? 
 

A: No way. Ha d no idea. I knew of the horror 
things that had happened through the cousins 
of mi ne that came back from there in 1940 and 
'3 9, but they didn't describe concentration 
camps. They didn't know anything about that. Wh
at they could describe was how a store 
window would be broken, a person would be ta
ken off the street, if you were a doctor 
you couldn't practice, if you were a teach
er you couldn't teach, if you wrote a book it 
wouldn't be published...those things I knew,
 but I didn't know anything about these 
camps. 
 

Q: The soldiers you were with and since you 
were an officer, the American soldiers you 
were with, did did they u
nderstand? Did you have...did you f
eel that you understood in a 
different way because you were a Jew?  Wa s there some thing you could translate...? 
 

A: No. I think this thing was so horrible that
 it really didn'
t ma tter what you were, what your 
religious background was, this thing was so
 horrendous that no ma tter who you were or 
what you were, it was going to plague you. You see, one of the reasons for the Holocaust 

Museum and one of the reasons for the expressi
on that the Jews in Israel use frequently 
now is "Never Again," and I have to tell 
you that anyone of my troops that went into 
Dachau with us would not become  a parent of
 a skinhead or a neo-Nazi or any one of 
those things, because what they say could 
never be  duplicated in histor y and hopefully 
never will be, it was so horrible. 
 

Q: Turning to your return to 
the United States, were you able 
to translate, tell people when 
you came ba ck, what you had seen so that they
 could understand?  Did they believe you? 
 

A: We didn't...we didn't dwell 
on that at all. When I came back, obviously I didn't have a 
civilian job. I was still in the 
service, until January of '46, but the B'nai B'rith and the 
Anti-Defamation League had me  going out to 
lunches and dinners to talk and it was a 

very propitious subject at that time . The war 
had just ended and we focused on the Julius 
Streicher stor y and never on the other facets 
that we'r e talking about today, so...and we 
also talked about Norma ndy, but we just never got into the concentration camp, the 

Dachaus of the world or any of that. It it didn'
t come up so I didn't paint that picture as I 
have just tried to do for you. It 
was...the picture was horrible. 
 

Q: Some thing that you wi
ll always reme mber. 
 

A: And everybody else that saw it will too. 

 

Q: How did it shape or change...did it change
 your life?  Did it aff
ect your life and your 
subsequent career? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181  
7 
 
01:08:  A: Yeah, but let's don't go t hat far ah
ead yet if you don't mi nd. The reason I say that 
is when you use the word change, it changed 
my l i fe dramatically right then because I 
wanted to capture as ma ny of these bastards 
as I possibly could. Now, how to go about it. 
When May 8th came around, my commanding o
fficer, a full colonel, my commanding 
officer told me  I couldn't use any of our me
n to go out on patrol and the reason, he said, 
was the war's over now and I can't  write a le
tter to some body's  mother and father tell 
them their son was killed on the 10th, the 11t
h, the 12th of May. I just can't do it. The 
war's over for us here. If they get killed, it woul
d have to be in a tr
affic accident, so he 
said but I don't object to your continuing to 
do your scouting and patrolling if you will, 
but you're going to have to do it with the SS troops that we have under our command, so 
there I was, driving through the 
Alps, narrow little roads, in a Volkswagen instead of an 
American jeep, with...I'm in the front right 
seat and I got a German driver, SS, and in 
those days, to make it even more precarious 
and the hipe and what have you, the rumor 
among the SS was they'r e all going to be executed for being in the SS so they really had 

very little stake at just turning the wheel a 
little bit and off the Alps we went, but during 
these tours, during these trips 
with the SS, I ma na ged to ge
t the president of Vienna...his 
name  was Delbruger (ph). I got...I found Jules Ol
berg (ph), who was the butcher of Paris, 
roaming around in a 20th Ar mored stockade in an
 enlisted man's coat and suit so that he 
would never be caught up in all this. 
 

Q: How did you find him?  How did you...? 

 

A: Well, you you began to get things from Burg
ermeisters mostly and tips that you were 
getting from other Germans who were fearful 
of being...we we we went into a bogey (ph) 
wheel factory and we found people in there that
 were hiding. It wa s...you had to take a 
finiculaire to get up there. We  we just sp
ent days and days and days looking for these 
people. I didn't  leave there until after Septembe
r and this is May 8 we'r e talking about, so 
that lasted ...that lasted quite a while. 
 

Q: Did the army object at all? 

 

A: No. They didn't object, and they were delig
hted when I would bri
ng these people in, but 
he wouldn't...my own comma
nding officer wouldn't let me  us e American troops. 
 

Q: So you left...you left Europe in Septembe
r. You returned to the United States? 
 

A: No. I didn't come back until later than that. 
In September I left  the Berchtesgarten area 
where we were picking these people up a
nd then I went up to Wi esbaden where 
Eisenhower's headquarters were and I me ntione
d earlier that I went
 to law school and I 
became the law me mber of a general court which 
is like...the court itse
lf is like a jury and 
the law me mber is the one who advises them on
 the law, and then I st ayed there until the 
end of the year and then I came back to the United States. 
 

Q: When you returned to the United States, 
did you tell people about
 what you had seen?  
Did you talk at all about...I know you 
tended to emphasize Streicher and your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181  
8 
 
involveme nt with the capture of Streicher, 
but did your fa mily ask you about the camps?  
Did you talk about that at all? 
 
A: Oh, I'm sure I did but I can't r
ecall specific instances at the moment. 

 

Q: Now to go back to my earlier question. Ho
w did this whole event affect you?  How did 
you feel comi ng back to the Un
ited States after the war? 
 

A: Well, you have to...you have to realize that th
ere's a camaraderie and a fraternalism i n the 
service that doesn't  exist anywhere that I know 
of in civilian life, 
particularly troops who 
have been engaged in combat together 
and who have survived, and there was a 
resentme nt but a friendly resentme nt from a
ll of my friends because as we arrived in 

Boston, there was a headline in the paper
...17,000 troops returning. Included among t hem 
is Henry Plitt, the ma n who captured Julius 
Streicher. And so out of 17,000, they named 
one name and the guys started to get pretty ir
ked with that and when I got off the boat in 

Boston, I was interviewed by the press and they
 asked what my post-
war plans were, and 
I said I would like to take 
a contingent down to South America and find Hitler because 

I'm sure he's  alive down there, and I figured 
this was going to turn 
into another job. At 
that point I didn't know what the future he
ld for me , but of c ourse it was pooh-poohed 
and it never happened, but it was another headlin
e in Boston, so we tr
eated it very lightly. 
We treated it very lightly. It
 was kind of a fun thing excep
t I left out a whole segment 
here. I came  back to the United States on what
 was known as the hero's tour. Those were 
people who were highly decorated and what 
have you, and their mi ssion was to sell war 
bonds. Now in those days we didn't finance a wa
r from taxes or from othe r countries. We 
financed the war from our own people 1:10:  putting up the money to fight the war, and 

so I spent time  here and my assignment was 
the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the 
president of the company and the vice presid
ent and all those people. They were very 
lovely people, and one of them said to me  if you come  back in one piece, call us. Now 

my speeches for the ADL and the B'nai B'rith and what have you, had gotten kind of tired 

and I called Paramount and they said you're going 
to be the first execu
tive trainee that we 
put to work post-war, and if you read Leona
rd Goldenson...he was the former chairma n 
of the board of ABC...if you r
ead his book called "Beating the O
dds," he tells the story of 
how I came to Paramount. Now that was in 
1946. In 1973 I bought half of that theater 
chain and in 1978 I bought the rest of it. And 
that's what Streicher had to do for me .

Q: You ma de a big leap from entering worki
ng for Paramount to buying out their chain. Can 
you fill us in briefly a little on some  of the hi
ghlights of that that interim pe riod?  Here 
you were a young war hero...

A: Well, what what actually ha
ppened (cough) is that I was supposed to be a trainee and I 
was supposed to learn all there was to 
know about theater operation, construction, 
projection, sound, etc. with the 
idea in mi nd that I would go back to Europe and I would 
begin to put together deals for Paramount to b
ecome  as i mpor tant in Europe as they we re 
here in the United Stat es. What
 actually happened is during 
the period of my training, I 
ingratiated myself...not intenti
onally...I didn't suck up to this guy, but I ingratiated myself 
with a ma n by the name  of E. B. Richards 
in New Orleans who was the big bad wolf of 
our industry. He was hated. He was feare
d. He was everything. And I didn't know how 
important he was and the first night that I 
me t him, I was living in...they call it...not the 
barracks but a dormitory where he ran this 
school for ma nagers...and I was living in the 
dormitory and I got back in and I wa s 
looking around. I saw a light somewhere and I 

went toward the light and it was a kitchen a
nd in the kitchen was a refrigerator and I 
opened the door and I took a couple of pieces of
 fruit out to eat and I heard a voice inside 
saying, who is that. And he sent a ma n who was with him out and the ma n asked me  to 

come  in and I walked in and he said, oh you'
re the pencil-pusher from New York that 
they sent down here, aren't  you. And I said if
 you consider six years of active service in 
the army and parachute troops qualifying me  as
 a pencil-pusher, I'll have it your way, 
yeah. Now I never realized nobody ever crossed 
this ma n. I mean he was powerful. There 
are some  great stories about him and I'm goi ng to digress for a mi nute and give you two 

of them. Number one, when a theater ma
nager would put signs up and where...you call 
them 8 x 10 photographs...and they were too low,
 he would go into that theater and he 
would get down on his stomach in the lobby a
nd look at the sign and 
get back up and say 
to the manager, gee that's great
. I hope all the rest of your 
audience is willing to do this. 
That was one of his stories. The other one
 which is even more important is that 
Paramount at one time  wanted to put cash regi
sters into the concessi
on booths, areas, and 
E. B. Richards resented this. He wasn't  going to have any part of it. So Leonard 
Goldensen who was then heading the theater 
division, but he really wasn't  over E. B. 
because E. B. was a partner and Leonard was 
an employee but even though he was a head 
of a division, E. B. took a train and he went
 from New Orleans to New York and he got 
there and he walked into the New York Pa
ramount and he bought a Hershey bar, which 

in those days was five cents, and he gave th
e girl a $20 bill, and when she turned around 
to ring up his sale, he swooped everything off th
e counter into his hat, took his change 
and he went upstairs. Now the Paramount Th
eater was in the Pa ramount Building where 
our offices were. He went upstairs to Le
onard's office and after they exchanged 

pleasantries, he said to Leonard, say 
Lennie, you running a sale downstairs. And 
Goldensen said no, why Rich, what are you ta
lking about. He says look what I bought for 
a nickel and he threw the whole damn thing on 
his...so this is the kind of ma n 01:12:  this 
was. If you reme mber the hucksters with Clar
k Gable and the big fat guy who said straw 
in the wind, opened the window and threw his ha
t out...that was E. B. Ri chards type. Any 
way, he became  my me ntor for a while a
nd Goldensen...in 1950 the Federal Governme nt 
split the st udios and the theaters and Goldense
n at that time on behalf of Paramount was 
out all over the country buying up these chai
ns, and he bought Richar
d's chain but it was 
to take...this was in May...but 
it was to take effect the 3rd 
of January and after he got 
back home, he began scratching his head and 
saying gees, what will I have by the 3rd of 
January. He could move everyt
hing out. He'll have a circuit of his own, so he called 
Richards and he said I would like to send 
a representative down there between now and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181

the 3rd. Rich said OK. You've got one ma n in
 the company I'll take. He's a northerner but 
we don't have any disregard for him. It was He
nry Plitt. So off I go to New Orleans. I had 
a very hectic period of time
 between the time  I got there in July and the following 
January 3rd because I was walking on two si
des of a track. I had to...my responsibility 
was to Paramount but at the same  time  I 
was ostensibly an employee of Paramount 
Richards, so it was a pretty 
tough thing and when I got to 
Pensacola, Leonard came  down 
on a trip and I said you know, Leonard, I don't have
 an office. If I wore a hat, I wouldn't  
have a place to hang it. What is my future he
re. He said you're the he
ir apparent, and that 
was enough for me . Three years later I took over. 
 

Q: Now a ma jor portion of your lif
e in addition, of course, to 
your professiona
l career and 
your impact in the entertainment i
ndustry, has been charitable work.  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What got you...how did you get involved in...part
icularly in your...has 
it any relationship 
to your experiences during the war?  Does it...? 
 

A: Initially no. Subsequently yes. My my real
 initial involveme nt in
 charity work was in 
1949 I was then kind of general ma nager of 
the Richards, ex-Ric
hards circuit, now 
Paramount, and Leonard Goldensen again who 
had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that 
we in our theaters cooperate in
 fund raising and I got a traile
r to run on my screen, but I 
couldn't find anybody to ma ke the collections so...because it wa s Mother's Day that 

Sunday...so instead of continuing to seek 
people who said no, I can't  go because it's 
Mother's Day, I called a meeting with an ad
 for the cerebral palsy parents in Orleans 
Parish, and they came to the meeting and becau
se they couldn't leave their kids alone at 
home , the kids were with them, and I saw thes
e kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't  
Dachau by any ma tter or means, but it was a h
eavy sympathy factor to see these kids that 
just didn't have appropriate treatment, didn'
t have appropriate diagnostic work, if the 
diagnosis wa s right they didn't have the discip
lines to do it because it could have been 
dental, it could have been ort
hopedic, it could have been any 
number of things, and they 
just didn't have the doctors for it and not only th
at, they couldn't diagnosis it, so I kind of 
fell in love with that, and in short order I 
took over the organization and then I became  
the president of the Cerebral Palsy Associa
tion of New Orleans, subsequently Cerebral 
Palsy Association of Louisiana, then Regiona
l Vice President of the national organi zation 
covering the South, and during all this, I would tr
avel to different cities and I would meet 
with interested people and 
parents and I would get them
 going. Later on, I go to New 
York and there I really
 don't do very much of anything, but
 subsequently to that I go to 
Chicago and there I get back into cerebral 
palsy and I become the chairman of that 
organization for three years, which takes us
 now 01:14:  to 1967 at which time I go to 
Israel and the Six Day War. 
 

Q: Did you go to Israel before the Si x Day Wa r? 

 

A: No. For the last day...the last day. But th
e tanks were on the gr
ound and the shoes were 
where the Ar abs ran off and left them running so fast, and it was...it was quite a picture. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181  
11 
 
was a thoroughly, thoroughly...I don't know...I just 
fell in love with Israel, absolutely fell 
in love with it. I me t with Motte Gur? __ who wa
s the general in charge  of the air force at 
the time ...you know Motte?  I notic
ed you nodded. My wife said to
 Motte, congratulations 
on your work for the Six Day Wa r. And he said
 to her, we were home for lunch the first 
day, and, you know, they'r e, they'r e not very re
luctant to demonstrat
e their bravado but 
with it all, then the next year I went back
 to lecture to parachute troops, and I thought, 
you know, these guys are going to look up at the pl
atform and see this old goat talking to 
them and they'r e young and they'r e full of vim a nd vigor and they don't...they're not 

interested in what this g
uy...unbelievable. They had never jumped in combat. They were 
jumpers, but they had never been employed 
as parachute troops, and when I came in 
telling them stories about our combat jumps 
and the for mation of our air planes and how 
we had to do different things, they wasn't
...there wasn't  anybody in the audience that 
wasn't  electrified. Now that's another reas
on, and the next thing you know I go to Hetzoa?  

Air Force Ba se and I meet the commanding offi
cer and I ask him what he needs, and he 
needs a game  room, a play room. Well, what 
to do. I came back to the United States and 
raised the money, and that began it all. 
Then I became very involved in Bar Ilan 
University. Actually I became the president of 
the West Coast Friends of Bar Ilan and the 
next step in my Israeli occupation was Sha'ar
ei Tsedek Hospital in Jerusalem, and there 

we have the Sedge(??) and Henr
y Plitt Heart Surgery, and the 
reason for that is that  Dr. 
Matloff (ph) who did heart surgery on me  wa
s interested in moving his heart surgeon 

program to Israel. Pr ior to his doing that, 
there wa s an eighteen month wait between 

diagnosis and treatment...and and and care in
 surgery. Now you have to realize that 
before they do heart surgery, they do an a
ngiogram. There was a three month wait to get 
an angiogram done, and then af
ter the three mont h wait, you're
 on a list. Hopefully you'll 
be taken between twelve and ei
ghteen months from then. If you'
re still alive, they'll treat 
you in eighteen months. If you're not, of course, it's academi c. So we wanted to move the 
same  system that they have here at Cedar 
Sinai which does a great deal of heart work, 
over to Israel and we started it based upon 
his jumping on my bones, we started a thing 
called Heart to Heart fr om Los Angeles to Jeru
salem, and today that is functioning at the 
Sha'arei Tsedek Hospital, and we'r e all thrilled with it. 
 
Q: Before we close, I'd like to go back just fo
r a mo me nt to your capture of Streicher and are 
there any details...between the time  you identi
fied who Streicher was and you got him in 
the jeep, or even in the j
eep...did he say anything?  Did he
 put up any resistance of any 
for m?  
 

A: No. He didn't put up any resistan
ce, but ther e is a story attached 
to it. Fi rst of all, I was so 
excited at what I had that I have to tell you, 
I I didn't follow any rules. His wife gave him 
a raincoat. I didn't exami ne the raincoat. I di
dn't know that there was no weapon in it. His 
wife took his slippers off, which he had 
been using out on the porch, and substituted 
shoes for them and that's no big deal, but the f
act that I let hi m get th
at coat and not even 
feel it to see if there's an
ything in it was a real blunder,
 but after I dropped him at 
Berchtesga rten with the recognition of all 
the mi stakes I'd ma de because we  usually 
search a place where you have taken so
me body, from which you have taken some body, 
so I went back to We idring that night and his wi
fe gave me  a letter which is here 01:16:  
in the Holocaust Museum...the original is in 
the Museum...which indicates that this is the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0181  
12 
 
first night they've been separated since their marriage. They had been married about forty 
days. She was his nurse I think, 
and he had left...forgotten to 
take his glasses with him, 
and in the letter she enclosed
 his glasses which she asked me  to give to him and she 
started being extremely tearful, almo st to th
e point of wailing, and I said you just don't  
understand the American way of life. If your
 husband is the good ma n that you describe 
him as being, he'll back home  to you, but if he 
is what we think he is, you'll never see him 

again. That's all I have to say about
 that. That's  all that happened. 
 

Q: Before we close, is there some thing you'd 
like to add?  Is there some thing you'd like to 
say?  
 

A: I think there are two things 
I would like to say, one of whic
h I ma y have said earlier but I 
think it's  important to repeat it. One 
man, one woman, one person can make a big 
difference in in anything, and the words that ar
e used so frequently in Israel today that 
should be a watch word for all of us, Jew and 
gentile alike, are the words "Never Again.ﬂ  
 

Q: Thank you very much, Mr. Plitt. 

 

A: Thankyou.
