ALE XANDER ROSE NBERG  
June 13, 2000 
Tape 1, Side A 
 [Copy-checked and partially authenticated by A.D. --9/20/05] 
 
 

Q: Okay, so we™re just going to start with a test
 of your voice.  How ma ny da
ys were you in Ireland? 
 

A: 15, plus a traveling da y at each
 end.  We  were gone for 17 days. 
 

Q: And what kind of– wha t  was the most me morabl
e sights, some of the 
most me mora ble sights 
that you saw? 
 

A: Well, the Cliffs of Mohe r, a
nd believe it or not my brother. 
 

Q: Oh, your brother? 

 

A: Yeah, my brother happened to be in Irela
nd at the same  time and we ma naged to meet. 
 

Q: Was that pure coincidence? 

 

A: Pure coincidence, right.  I got 
an e-mail from hi m two days before 
we left about my cousin™s cell 
phone number.  And I said what is
 this all about?  A
nd called him to find out.  I didn™t know he 
was going to be there and he didn™t 
know I was going to be there.   
 
Q: That™ssome thing. 
 

A: And we me t .  That was fun. 

 

Q: Okay, it™s June the 13
th
 of the year 2000 and we are in the 
home  of Alexander Rosenberg for an 
oral hi stor y interview that ™s mainly going to fo
cus on his expe riences after the Holocaust because 
he has been interviewed by the Survivors of
 the Shoah Foundation once before.  And we™re 
ma inly going to be following up on that interv
iew and asking some  pre-war and wartime 
questions to clarify and expand and then moving 
on into the post-war era.  And my na me  is 
Arwen Donahue and we are in Louisville, Kentuc
ky, this is tape number one, side A.  I guess 

what I™ll do is just briefly summarize for the ta
pe some  of what was discussed in your first 
interview and then you can correct me  if I get 
anything wrong.  So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in 
1927 in Frankfurt am Ma in, Germany, and moved 
with his family in 1937 to– well, moved to 
Berlin and be tween then and 1937 and then move
d to Holland in 1937, where he lived until he 
and his fami ly were deported to
 the Westerbork camp in Hol l and.  
And were there, and that was, 
you said you weren™t certain whethe
r it was 1942 or ™43, when you were–? 
 

A: That is correct.  I keep thi
nking it was September of ‚42 and we
 were there until the beginning of 
‚43.  My brother thinks 
I™m off by a year, but I think he™s 
off by a year.  I clearly reme mber 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

Easter of ‚44 and we had to have been there ab
out a year by that time, so I think my dates are 
correct.   
 
Q: And Easter of ‚44 what you reme mb
ered was being in Bergen-Belsen. 
 

A: That is correct.  Yeah, it wa
s an air attack– well, a group of 
B-17™s was returning from a bomb 
run, possibly Hanover, and the escorting fighter 
planes came  down to have a look.  And our 
super-sma rt guards decided to let go with machin
e guns from the guard towers and they fired 
back.  And nobody got hurt, but I clea
rly reme mb er that incident.   
 

Q: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about 
Bergen-Belsen, but I guess 
first what we™ll do is– 
okay, so you were deported from We sterbork to 
Bergen-Belsen some  undetermi ned date.  And 
then were in Bergen-Belsen until 1944. 
 

A: ‚45. 

 

Q: Oh, yeah, around April 10
th
, 1945 you were away, and it was close 
to the time – of course.  And 
liberated some where outside 
of, some where in Germany. 
 

A: Yeah,east,Tribitz 
(ph)
 was the name of the little village, 
which is about ten, 15 miles east of 
Torgau.  Torgau is on the river El be, where the Ge rman and Russian troops me t on that same  

day, April the twenty-t hird, that  we were liber
ated early in the morning by the Russian army. 
 

Q: Let™s go back then, one ques
tion that I had was about your ea
rlier childhood before the war 
started.  And you had mentioned 
in your first interview some th
ing about your fa mily.  Your 
father was an investme nt banker.  You had a 
brother who was ten months– was he ten months 
older or younger? 
 
A: Younger,younger. 

 

Q: Ten months younger.  And did you, and you said th
at your family was not very religious.  You 
basically went to synagogue for high holidays. 
 Was your family really very assimilated? 
 

A: Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in partic
ular I would say so.  Yes.  My dad certainly 
considered hims elf Ger man first and never expected
 the viol ence to get to the level that it did.  
And certainly would not affect him si nce he wa
s a veteran of World Wa r One that was wounded.  
Had volunteered for the army in the first place 
and was wounded, I believe two or three time s 
and had the Iron Cross, which I™ve been trying to 
locate and can™t find.  So that I would say they 
considered themselves primarily German and ass i milated is the right word. 
 

Q: Did you speak Yiddish or Hebrew? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Were any of your friends, were most of your
 fa mi ly friends Jewish and your own personal 
friends?

A: I think so, but I wouldn™t know for sure.  In Ams t erdam I would say that 
was not necessarily the 
case.  But I really don™t reme mber, I reme mber
 only really family from Germany.  I don™t 

reme mber any children from school or acquaintances
 of my parents.  Fo
r that matter I wouldn™t 
know what their religion was. 
 So, I really can™t answer. 
 

Q: And then another question from a different time.
  When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe 
you me ntioned in the first interview that before
 your fa mily was actua
lly caught in a round-up 
and deported to We sterbork, you had been caught 
in another round-up and some how managed to 
get out.  Now that wasn™t clear to me  from th
e first interview what had happened during that 
time.   
 

A: I don™t reme mber whether I was picked up at ho
me or off the street a
nd taken to a collection 
point where we were supposed to have been depor
ted some where.  And I walked away from it, 
and wasn™t challenged in th
e process and got back home . 
 

Q: So it was just you?   It wasn™t me mbers of your family? 

 

A: I don™t know.  I think it was just me , that™s right. 

 

Q: And what happened the second time when your whole fa mily was deported? 

 

A: The second time  they, as they always did, they
 came in the mi ddle of the night and you had five 
mi nutes to get dressed and get your, your bags 
were always packed because you knew it coul d 
happen.  And you were hauled off in a truck alon
g with other people, taken to the railroad 
station.  Put on a train not knowing where to.  An
d then I went to We sterbork, which was the 
transit camp  that the Germans had established; it
™s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle.  
And we were held there for about six months.  
I don™t think there were an
y other deportations.  
There ma y have been one or two trains beforewe were hauled out.  And I think the general 

impression was that they were going to go to 
Theresienstadt.  Why I don™t know.  But– never 
heard of Belsen before.  As a ma tte
r of fact, we were one of the ea
rliest ones in there.  Belsen 
was– I™m not sure if it was on a previous tape or
 not.  When we got there, of course it was a 
very large facility.  Part of it was a Russian
 POW camp.  But obviously designed for officers, 
because they had little cabins and gravel walks be
tween them and that sort of thing.  And then 
there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners
.  One was for, called criminals and the second 
section was for the Jews.  And as they started to
 fill up the Jewish section there were a number of 
trainfuls of Jews from Holland, 
a lot of Hungarians, French wo
me n.  They were the wives of 
officers who were POW™ s from the French Army.  
And then after the, in
 ‚44, after the invasion 
of Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews th
at Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in 
camps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross s
upervision.  They all had British uniforms and 
heavy British, woolen coats and th
e like, and lots of good food.   
 

Q: Yeah, you did talk some  about that in the fi
rst interview.  When 
you were heading towards 
Westerbork, did you know anything about
 We sterbork before you arrived? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

A: No, never heard of We st erbork.  And of cour
se, you know, it™s ma ybe a two hour train ride at 
most.  No, never heard of it before, at least I ha
dn™t, I don™t know whether my parents ever had.  
No idea. 
 
Q: Did you have any idea at the time  of 
what had started to happen to Jews? 
 

A: No, no.  They always said we™d be relocating in
 a work camp or whatever.  Or vague promises of 
exchanging for money, that relatives, particular
ly in America could buy you and so forth.  But 
no, nobody had any inkling of what layahead in terms of the violence. 
 

Q: And you talked in some  detail about what you 
reme mbered of your time in We sterbork and that 
you had been, you had contracted polio.  Had you r
eally recovered from the symptoms of that by 
the time  that you were deported to Bergen-Belsen? 
 

A: I would say so.  The problem that I had were pr
imarily with the right knee and I still have some  
problems with that knee.  But I was spared th
e recurrence that apparently happened to older 
people when it was discovered in the 
last ten or 15 years or so.  It
 must have been a fairly mild 
case even though polio, of course
 back then was rampant.  
 

Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me 
if it™s correct.  I have 
the impression that your 
fa mily was fairly close-knit and that you™re we
ren™t necessarily formi
ng s t rong bonds with other 
people outside of your family.  Is that correct? 
 

A: Yeah, I think so.  I don™t think anybody for med a
ny bonds at all.  It was a ma tter of survival and 
I don™t mean to imply that you tried it at the e
xpense of some body else.  But once we realized, 
I™m not sure we really realized, but when it beca
me  a ma tter of trying to 
survive, you didn™t and 
a fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you ma y not wake up in the morning.  

Nobody really tried to get attach
ed to anybody else.  You didn™t 
form any bonds other than to, 
you didn™t try to antagonize anybody, 
but there wasn™t any real frie
ndships or relationships of 
any kind.  Well, there really wasn™t much time e ither. 
 

Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual se
nse of deepening horror 
and insecurity or was 
there a mo ment when you really, that you reme mb
er having been really, realized what was 
happening? 
 

A: No, it was, that was, in a way the tragedy was th
at it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to 
speak, in that– I reme mber the first two days in
 Belsen, there was so mu ch food we couldn™t eat 
it.  There was no nutrition, but a l
iter of soup, even if it was only
 a liter of warm water with 
nothing in it.  You™re not used to
 drinking a liter of volume, a quart
.  It took two days and you ate 
it all and were hungry.  And then th
e amount of food that you got kept
 getting less and less.  And 
initially there were, the guards 
kept changing constantly and surp
risingly they kept getting more 
and more vicious rather than less so.  The last 
group which maybe was there for a year, year and 
a half, I don™t recall fo
r sure for how long, were World Wa r 
One veterans who were too old or 
too feeble or had been wounded.  But they were 
not suitable for frontline 
service in the German 
Ar my.  And you would think that they would be not 
so hateful.  And they weren™t ma ybe the first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

5
week, but they got there very qui
ckly, got to be pretty vicious. 
 And I™m not sure whether they 
were told to or it was a natural progre
ssion as the sensitivities wore off.   
 
Q: So even as a young child you grew some how 
hardened to this e
xperience would you say? 
 

A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive.  
You couldn™t, it wa sn™t that you wouldn™t help 
some body up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful.  Yes, you probably were– 

ma ybe more encapsulated than hardened. 
 

Q: Do you remember private conversations that
 you were able to have with your fa mily? 
 

A: None, absolutely none.  I don™t really reme mber 
very much.  You reme mber
 the weird things but 
not the everyday.  And I™m sure that others woul
d have reme mbered something totally different 

that I don™t even reme mber happening.  Like that
 Easter Sunday, the fighter attack.  Well, 
because of it, one of the barracks that got s
hot up was the warehouse.  And one thing the 
Germans ha d were cans of beef in its own juice. 
 And apparently some  of those got bullet-riddled 
so they had to use them right away.  For a c
ouple of days we actually got food, but then they 
ma de up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again. 
 

Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported 
from We sterbork to Bergen-Belsen?   Anything 
about that?  
 

A: No, nothing in particular.  They, I guess in 
the afternoon the train wa
s pushed into, the empty 
train was pushed into the compound.  It was passenge
r cars.  Then they posted name s, they called 
them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later.  Got on the train, nobody knew 

where it was going to go.  Supposedly it was just
 a relocation and they always promised you 
some thing better.  Of course it never was.  
But particularly initially you didn™t know.  And I 
guess they had to, that I™m sure explains why 
there was no really ma ssive resistance.  If you 
knew you were going to go to the gas chamber you ma y 
as well try and fight it.  So you get shot 
on the spot.  I think that™s why there™s, 
the general docility of the deportees.   
 

Q: Had transports been leaving fr
om We sterbork for some  ti me  before yours left?   In other words, 
were you– 
 

A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don™t kn
ow whether we were the th
ird or fifth or tenth.  
But yes, there had been others.  And of course
 you never got any feedback in terms of where 
they went or how they were treated.   
 

Q: So, you ma y have had the sense then that at 
any point your name  could be called and you™d be 
getting on the– 
 

A: Yes, yes, I think so.  Yeah, I think it was 
generally recognized that
 Westerbork was a transit 
camp and not a permanent inst
allation.  So, I think so. 
 

Q: And about your time in Westerbork, I™m sorry, 
in Bergen-Belsen.  You were there relatively 
early as you just me ntioned.  And I wondered if in
 the long term you feel that having been there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
6
 
 
 
6
early on enabled you to, or was an advantage 
as far as– you did me ntion that it was an 
advantage as far as food.  But I wondered if 
your resistance was str
onger and if you knew the 
system better? 
 
A: Well system, there was really no system.  Bu
t yeah, I think so, because the people who came 
very late, particularly if they did not come  fr
om a nother camp  but straight from home s o to 
speak.  They were plunged from a norma l diet 
to 200, 300, whatever it wa s, calories a day.  And 
I think they died faster than those of us w
ho, even though they ma y have had physical, physically 
more reserves than we did, who our reserves were 
spent.  But we ma y have been a little bit more 
cautious.  And also we were so disease-ridde
n and I don™t know whether our immune systems 
had strengthened.  Those are me dical issues th
at I don™t know about.  People who were plunged 
into this diarrhea, flea, lice, you 
know all the vermin.  They c ould not tolerate it as mu ch as those 
of us who were exposed
 to it more slowly. 
 

Q: To what extent did you have contact with the 
other me mbers of your fa mi ly while you were in 
Belsen?  
 

A: We saw them almost every day.  My dad and my  
brother and I, we were in the same  barrack.  At 
night the me n and the wome n were separated, bu
t during the day they could mi ngle freely if you 
were there.  We all were in work details.  
My mother worked in the, what do you call it?   
Hospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary.  
So, she physically stayed inside the camp.  My 
dad worked, I think he worked the whole time  on 
the shoe disassembly detail.  I was on it for a 
little while before they shipped me outside to 
work details outside.  My brother was working 
outside the camp too, I think.  But I don™t reme mb
er where, what details
 he was assigned to. 
 

Q: And what about, you me ntioned having to steal f
ood in order to survive.  Was that some thing 
that the newe r prisoners ma ybe wouldn™t have kn
own how to do or that you kind of eventually 
l e a r ne d?  
 

A: Well (laughs)– no, I think everybody– you didn™t 
steal from each other, generally.  Even 
though it was a ma tter of survival.  I me ntioned 
the Libyans who ca me from Italy.  They came 
with humongous quantities of food.  And we had the opportunity to steal some  of it.  And we 

actually buried it between the tracks 
so we could bring it back slow
ly.  The other thing is being 
on the outside you were, not always, but some tim
es you were patted down, and so you couldn™t 
have anything on your body that didn™t belong to 
you.  They must have had a bad storm some  
years prior to establishi ng the camp.  Bergen-Bel
sen was inside a military trai ning camp, similar 
to Fort Knox.  A lot of trees had been, had fallen 
over in this storm or storms.  And they had cut 

the trees and hauled them off, but there were
 the roots, you know, standing up.  And for a 

number of months I worked in the woods diggi
ng up those tree stumps, which were then, were 
hauled into– once a week they came out with th
e horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those 
tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were
 hauled in.  There wa
s another detail inside 
the camp that was chopping them up into firewood.  
That™s the one I was assigned to the day of 
that air attack.  There were blueberries growing 
in the woods and one, of course we ate as much 
as we could, but also we all ha
d, like a bag that was tied to your
 belt inside your pants.  So you 
could pick berries and bring them in for the fami l y
 to eat.  So there was th
at and then, of course, 
if we could we stole the food from the guards. 
 [Laughing.]  Boy, they™d take a whipping.  They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
7
 
 
 
7
would get their food and most of 
the time  if they didn™t finish 
it, it just sat there.  And if 
some body, we got a chance, we would try and get t
hose cans and eat it.  But apparently one day 
we ate them before they had eaten and so we
 got a pretty good whipping for that.  It wa s 
probably worth it.  It was good f
ood.  They didn™t eat too bad.  Th
ey got pretty decent food.   
 
Q: Was there a real uniformity of
 cruelty among the  guards or we re 
any of them kind at all to you? 
 

A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it 
later on that he was a spy for the British, he 
seemed to be more of a – I wouldn™t want to ca
ll him huma ne, but had a better sense of humor.  
And some  individual guards were 
exceedingly cruel and would use 
any excuse to either kick you 
or club you with a rifle or shoot 
you, shoot at you.  There was one
 incident that I recall where 
one of the guards was giving one of the me n, this was in the woods, gave him hell.  And he 

responded in Dutch, ﬁMan, you™re crazy.ﬂ  And it 
turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a 
Dutchman, a nd boy did he beat the living daylights 
out of him, out of the prisoner.  And then 
when we came back that evening, the sergeant wa s 
there and he, we all had 
to stand at attention.  
And he de manded to know if anything had happene
d and this turkey said, ﬁYes sergeant, this 

ma n said I™m crazy.ﬂ  The sergeant said, ﬁThat ma
n was right, detail dismisse
d.ﬂ  We got sent on.  
But it varied.  Some  of 
t hem would turn their back and just 
did their job.  But they constantly 
changed.  You never knew.  You never spoke to
 any of them.  Some  of t hem would drop a 
cigarette butt and walk away.  Others would dr
op the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to 
pick it up and then step on your fingers.  You never knew. 
 

Q: What about friendships in 
Belsen?   Did you, was it still pret
ty much each one for his own? 
 

A: Yeah, you didn™t have time for 
friendships.  You tried to slee
p as long as you could in the 
mornings.  You had a few mi nutes to wash your f
ace and get dressed and stand at reve ille, that™s 
not the right word. 
 

Q: Rollcall? 

 

A: Roll call, thank you.  Until they got done, depends 
on how they felt whether they got done or not.  
And then you went to wherever your work assi
gnme nt was and then when you came back at 
night, there could have been anot
her roll call before or
 after and you ma y have
 got some thing to 
eat and you went straight to bed.  There was ne
ver any time  to talk to anybody, unless some body 
you worked with, the guard had a back turned you c
ould talk to each ot her.  But most of the time 
you couldn™t.  They wouldn™t let you.   
 

Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same ? 

 

A: Oh yes, pretty much so.  Except they got bett
er food on Sundays.  They got three cans instead of 
two. 
 

Q: Did you have any sense of time 
or way to keep track of time? 

 

A: Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week
 it was, what time of day it was, I™m not sure.  
I don™t think anybody had watches.  Because at 
noon time they would bring the food out to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

8
where you were working.  We  ma y ge
t five or ten mi nutes to eat 
and that was it.  And sunrise 
and sunset, but other than that whether it wa
s ten of eleven or te
n of twelve, nobody cared 
whether you knew it or not.   
 
Q: You me ntioned that you were tr
ansferred after you were
 chopping the stumps into the detail that 
was meeting the rail cars as they were comi ng i
n, and you said some thing about the Libyan Jews.  
I was wondering if you, were you there when th
e French wome n prisoners were comi ng in? 
 

A: No, I think they were already in the camp.  
Trains came and went all the time, not only with 
prisoners, but also soldiers.  They used the same
 railroad station.  Occasionally we would me et 
POW™ s.  The Americans always were good.  They
 would throw us packs of Ca me ls where we 
could get them.  But I don™t remember when th
e French wome n ca me .  There were only two 
hundred of them, so they ma y have come  in a gr
oup with others.  Probably since very few of 
them died, I would think they probably came 
fairly late.  But I just don™t reme mber. 
 

Q: I read some thing about it, that was partially why I asked.  It me ntioned they came  in the first half 
of ‚44 from Drancy in France.  And I just
 was curious if you reme mbered anything else. 
 

A: Oh, I would think they would ha
ve been longer than that.  I™m su
re they we re there longer than 
that, because first half of ™44–  Oh, I™m sorry, fo
rty, yeah it would have been about a year and a 
half, a little over.  Yeah, that™s
 about right, I would think.  No
, I don™t remember, other than I 
knew they were there, and–

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: Tape one, side B of an interview with Alexa
nder Rosenberg.  So you want
 to just repeat what 
you had just said? 
 

A: Yeah, later on they brought in wome n from Ausc
hwitz.  And I have to back up here a mi nute.  
There was an area where they had a huge circus 
tent, was set up.  That™s where they had the 
shoes.  Apparently, I don™t know over how long 
or what, the Germans ha d collected shoes for 
recycling or for donations or whatever the reason th
ey gave to collect them
.  And then also there 
were a lot of military boots in there si nce many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel 

holes apparently from either wounded or dead
 soldiers.  And what one of the big, quote, 
ﬁindustriesﬂ was, was separating th
e upper leather from the s oles a
nd heels and then separate the 
leather from the rubber heels and/or soles.  And 
that was done in that big tent.  And then there 
was a– the leather soles, I guess, was what they 
couldn™t reuse.  And so they were stacked up in 
a humongous pile that wa s on the ma in drag and kept
 getting higher and higher.  People, that was 
my first assignme nt was working on that.  You 
had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you 
had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn™t just
 fall over.  And they em
ptied that , emptied that 
tent of all the shoes, and they 
started to bring in wome n and they
 established a separate woma n™s 
camp.  And it turned out that one 
of the first groups in there 
included the wife, who had been 
with us, of a fellow.  She had worked in the k
itchen and she got caught taking some  food to try to 
give to her husband.  And first they shipped he
r to, I guess to Lüneburg, to jail.  And she was 
there in jail for a while and the 
police apparently were 
trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but 
couldn™t.  And ultimately she was shipped to Au
sc hwitz.  But the police 
had warned her about 
Auschwitz and so as she arrived she ma naged 
to walk from the incomi ng group to an outgoing 
group which happened to come  to Belsen.  And so she was back and she was in that group.  And 

she went to the fence and hollered at some body t o 
tell her husband that she was back by way of 
Auschwitz.  That™s how we knew 
that group had come from Auschw
itz.  You could talk to them 
usually across the fence as long as y
ou didn™t get too close to the fence. 
 

Q: Were you mostly speaking in Germa n while you lived in Belsen? 

 

A: Dutch. 

 

Q: Did you use your Germa n in speak
ing with any of the camp guards? 
 

A: No, you never spoke to the camp gua rds.  And I™
m not so sure I still could speak German back 
then.  But no.  They ma y give you an order, but 
that was it.  You never talked to them.  There 
was no conversation at all.   
 

Q: Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of Belsen  again, you 
described that time  in the first interview and 
how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of 
Germany.  And seen Berlin completely destroyed. 
 

A: Beautifulsight.

Q: I thought ma ybe we could just pick up with th
at time .  And I wondered 
if you could tell a little 
bit more about, well the time of liberation, 
encountering the Russian soldiers.  And you 
me ntioned how they were sharing bread and so forth.  We re they, the Russians have– had a 
reputation for being some ti me s vicious even with
 the people that  they liberated.  Did you 
witness any of that? 
 

A: No.  Initially we woke up because of– we were
 on the train still and th
e train was stopped.  And 
all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian
 Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you 
know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slun
g over their shoulders.  
And we had learned, like 
you said, the one word in Russian, 
chleb
 
(ph )
, which is bread.  And they let us off, and so we 
went on into town.  Then there must have been some  discussion about wh
ere to go and whoever, 
they told us just to go and if
 you need to, throw the Germans out.  And we happened to go into a 
fairly large house along with some  others, who– th
e woman claime d they were in the Nazis, but 
her husband was a mi nister.  And he sure wa
s in the SS.  And so we didn™t have any 

compunction about bullying them.  Some body, appare
ntly there must have been some people 
who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldie
rs spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian.  I 
reme mber some body said some thing about food, and 
so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun 

and shot a cow and said help yourself.  One of
 the French wome n recognized the opportunity and 

went with the fr ontline unit.  And of course, 
that morning crossed the El be River into the 
American part of Germa ny and ma na ged to get back
 to Paris, which of course had been liberated 
the year before.  And put an ad in the Paris pape
r, those who were looking for their wi ves, and I 
don™t know whether she me ntioned name s or it wa
s a specific group.  And they responded.  
Many of them were of course in the French Arm
y.  And so they got the American Army to send 
two of those two and a half ton trucks over to
 come  and get them.  And of course, everybody 
wanted to go.  And they promised they™d be
 back and they did.  I guess in the euphoria, you 
know, the war was over by that time. 
 I think we were in Tribitz 
(ph)
 for about six weeks.  All of 
the people that were still alive from that tr
ain, there were about a 
thousand of them, were 
evacuated by the Americans and take n to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp.  And the Russians 

let the trucks come in and get them.   
 

Q: What kind of condition were you in
 at the time of liberation?    
 

A: Barely alive if you can even count that.  We  ha
d to be very careful.  Many people died because 
they ate things that they couldn™
t digest.  Their digestive system
 was so severely weakened or 
disturbe d that a glass of milk would kill you.  You ju
st coul dn™t tolerate that sort of thing.  You 
had to be very careful that you ate 
only a little bit and a little bit.
  And of course a little bit was 
always more than what we had had for a long ti
me .  So that was impor
tant that you didn™t– I 
reme mber getting a hold, we heard that near by was a Army depot, f
ood depot, and we went 
there.  And sure enough there was.  And I got some– I™m not sure I got cans or an open bucket 

of condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in 
it.  And we just coul
dn™t eat it, not for a 
while.  Because we couldn™t di
gest it, it was that rich. 
 

Q: But you were able to walk? 

 

A: Oh yeah, yeah.

Q: I think you me ntioned how 
much you weighed, did you? 
 
A: Well when I got back to Amsterdam I we
ighed 78 pounds.  So I don™t know how mu ch I 
weighed then, ma ybe fifty or sixt
y, strictly skin over bones.  If 
I would have gotten a haircut, I 
would have taken a pound off. (Laughing.) 
 

Q: They didn™t shave your head
 while you were in Belsen? 
 

A: Yes, of course. 

 

Q: Were you with your entire family at th at point while you were riding the train? 

 

A: Yes.  Yes.  We were all together. 

 

Q: Was that mo me nt of enc ountering the Cossackunit, were you aware th
is is it, it™s over? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  Absolutely, absolutely. 

 

Q: Was that a pa rticular
ly emotionally charged–? 
 

A: Oh sure.  Oh absolutely, joyous.  Now you ha
d an opportunity, you mi ght live.  Might actually 
see 1946.  Definitely.  Yeah, everybody– I™m 
digressing, but I didn™t know anybody on that 
train.  I had never run into a
nybody who was, for that ma tter, never ran into anybody who was at 
Belsen.  And I guess it™s three year
s ago now.  We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we 
ever took.  It was a river cruise 
from Vienna to Amsterda m.  It was the first time that I was back 
in Germany and I wasn™t sure whether I could tolera
te it or not.  We  decided on this trip because 
I could just stay on the boat.  Di
dn™t have to go on land where I woul
d have to be in contact with 
any Germans.  But one night we™re having di
nner with two ladies.  One of whom, very 
interesting woma nŠshe was the one who introdu
ced the Lamaze me thod to the United StatesŠ

and her cousin.  And some how the other woma n wa
s telling us that her daughter was taking her 
daughter, the woma n™s grandchild, 
to Europe, Amsterda m.  They had discussed Anne Frank in 

class and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house
.  And she said, ﬁI told my daughter there™s 
always long lines at the Anne 
Frank house and if you can™t get in, go next door, that™s where 
your father was hidden during the 
war.ﬂ  And I said to her, ﬁOh, were you in Amsterdam during 
the war? ﬂ  And she said yes she was, but hertwo sisters both got found out.  They all had gone 

into hiding.  And they ended up in Belsen.  I sa
id, ﬁOh, that™s where I was.  I never me t anybody 
from Belsen.ﬂ  I said, ﬁAre they 
st ill alive?ﬂ  And she said yeah, th
e one sister was.  But the other 
sister and her husband died after th
ey were liberated.  They were hauled by train.  ﬁOh,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁto Tribitz?ﬂ  And she said ﬁY
es, how do you know? ﬂ   And I said, ﬁI was on that 
train also.ﬂ  
And so that™s as close as I ever came to
 meeting anybody or knowing anybody.  But the irony, 
irony, small world: the sister who wa
s still alive lived next door to
 my mo ther™s closest friend in 
New York.  So you never know.  But no, I didn™t 
know anybody and outside of that incident I 
have never talked to anybody who was there.  As 
a matter of fact, my brot
her is very active.  
He™s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Fra
nk house.  And I happened to be talking to him 
about a year or so ago and he told me , and I didn™t realize, I we nt to school with Anne Frank.  I 

was in the same  class, but I don™t reme mber her at 
all.  And I got to wondering if there is a class

12
 
 
 
12
picture that exists.  I™ll have to
 ask him of the grade school.  B
ecause we both should be in it.  
Just curious. 
 
Q: There is another woma n that we
 interviewed last year or so, w
ho went to school with Anne Frank 
as well.  I don™t recall her ma iden name , but
 her ma rried name  was Barbara Rodbell.   
 

A: There is somebody and my brother knows about it, 
her, that is apparen
tly active in the Anne 
Frank House Foundation and goes around speaking.  I™m 
not sure if it™s the same  woma n or not.  
But somebody that was either  a fr ie
nd of Anne Frank or knew her. 
 

Q: And actually I mi ght be mi staken, she mi ght not 
have been in school, she was a friend of hers.  
Her sister especially.  But they 
mi ght have lived nearby.  So, you
™re with your fa mily and you™re 
returning to Amsterdam,  and you described some , in
 the first interview, some  of that– you were 
housed first in the DP camp in Leipzig? 
 

A: First in Leipzig.  Essent ially what it was, was 
a military barracks that  was used.  We could come 
and go.  We  were not prisoners.  They let us come and go.  Matter of fact, very grateful about 

ma ny things.  De-lousing with DDT.  They spraye
d us from head to toe with DDT.  Think how 

environmentally unacceptable that is today.  And I™m s
till alive in spite of it.  But it got rid of the 
fleas and in particular the lic
e which was so important.  Bu
t we could come  and go as we 
pleased.  And I don™t reme mber it was with my
 brother or some  other boys, anyway, young me n, 
we would get on the trolley and the conductor tryi
ng to collect money from us and we told him 
what he could do, or what we would do.  We  were 
pretty nasty.  So they left us pretty much 
alone.  And then we weren™t ther
e all that long.  And then when 
they were told, they™re going to 
take us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross trai
n.  We wouldn™t go onto the beds because they 
were absolutely starched, bleached, pe rfectly white 
sheets.  And here we were, in spite of getting 
regular baths, pretty filthy.  We  
only had one set of clothes and shoe
s.  I™m sure we had shoes.  I 
had a woman™s blouse, because I remember it, 
Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way.  
But they weren™t even able to 
fit, not small enough.  They insist
ed we get in the beds and don™t 
worry about getting them dirty.  And then they 
brought us bread that was 
as white as the sheets 
were.  Couldn™t believe that.  Bu
t anyway they took us back to
 Holland and they put us in a 
convent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then
 sorted things out.  And you had to have a 
place to stay before they™d send you back to 
Amsterdam.  And that was taken care of.   
 

Q: While you were still in Germany di d you witn
ess anybody, any of the former prisoners taking 
revenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself? 
 

A: No.  We ll, I suppose if you would have known some body or r un into some body that you knew 
had been a, recognized a prison 
guard, I don™t think he 
would have survived.  But that would 
have been such a chance encounter.  No.  We ll, 
for one thing we were w
earing what looked like 
American Army unifor ms because that™s the only cl
othi ng, I guess, that we were given.  I™m not 
sure what else the Red Cr oss had that they gave 
us.  So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide 
berth.  Because they didn™t have anything to 
do anyway.  Things were pretty chaotic.   
 

Q: Do you recall how you felt at the tim
e?   Angry or happy or any hopes? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
13
 
 
 
13
A: Hopeful is probably the best.  N
o, I don™t think anger set in until late
r.  At that point you™re just 
trying to revive, was probably the closest word to 
describe it.  You™re still fairly weak.  You™re 
beginning to get a little better.  
You can eat a little bit more.  Be
ginning to feel a 
little better all 
the time .  And at this point you™re
 just trying to survive.  You
™re really not thinking about the 
future, what you want to do, or 
what you have to do or what y
ou™re going to do.  You™re still 
preoccupi ed with eating, primarily. 
 
Q: And getting enough to eat? 

 

A: And getting, yeah, yeah, sure.  And we did.   

 

Q: What about your, when you returned to Amster
dam and just adjusting to daily life again? 
 

A: Well, initially of course, I think we we re all 
spread out.  I stayed w
ith one fa mily who was a 
friend of my  parents.  My brot
her stayed with a friend of hi
s.  His closest friend was an 
American.  His father was the di stributor for Ho
lland and Belgium of RKO, the movi es.  And I 
think he stayed with them.  A
nd my parentsstayed w
ith, I don™t even remember who i t  was.  
Some body.  So we were in different
 locations.  We weren™t really, 
and this was like, talking the 
summer of ‚ 45.  There really wasn™t much goi
ng on.  Trying to see about getting back into 

school.  My high school class ha
d graduated.  I think we ma y have actually been back in 
Amsterdam when the graduation was, but of course
 they wouldn™t give me my diploma.  Hadn™t 
been there in four years.  Four out of six 
wasn™t good enough.  And so my  mother was ma king 
arrangements to see what the school about me  tr
ying out, well both of us, trying to get back into 

school in the Fall.  What the requirements would 
be, and trying to line up 
a tutor and a place to 
live.  And I think, some body– the Dutch did thin
gs fairly reasonably.  The person that was 
living in our house had gotten there in good faith.  
He did not know, or they did not know that 
was the property or the residenc
e of deported Jews.  And so what they did, if the person had 
some thing in good faith, so you don™t have, just transf
er the victim from on
e person to another.  
They could stay there.  So my parents f
ound a place to live.  A
nd I don™t know where the 
furniture came  from, whether that was, whethe
r those were donations or
 purchases or whether 
they had given some  of that furniture to some bod
y to hide.  But anyway we ultima tely had an 
apartment where we lived.  And then school started 
pretty soon.  We  had a tu
tor trying to get us 
up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior
 class on the condition that if I didn™t measure 
up, that the school would have the 
right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of 
the year .  Well that™s the deal they made with my
 parents, obviously.  Ap
parently I did all right 
because– and I do reme mber having to go to a c
ouple of teachers after classes for additiona l 
instruction.  It™s kind of tough 
to pick up solid geometry if 
you haven™t had trigonometry.  So, 
trying to catch up. 
 

Q: Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what
 you had been through?   Was that a challenge at 
all? 
 

A: I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppos
e so because that™s the only thing we did, was to 
go to school.  And you come  home , and you ma y ha
ve had to stay after class for additiona l 
instruction.  And depending onŠI™m not sure 
whether you™re fa miliar with the European 
systemŠit™s not ten mi nutes worth of home wo
rk.  You spent every night doing home work, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
14
 
 
 
14
we went to school on Saturdays half a day.  And 
so ma ybe we were allowed to go and play for 
ten mi nutes before dinner.  Or if we happene
d to get done by eight o™clock, the home work, we 
could play for a half hour before going to bed. But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except 
maybe for the weekends. 
 

Q: So you didn™t, you weren™t necessarily ever– wa
s there a point were you reme mber you started 
really reflecting on what had happened to you? 
 

A: No, not really.  It really would have been 
pointless anyway.  The Dutch had been exceedingly 
helpful, and trying to shield peopl
e.  And not personally, but from ot
hers that they tried to hide 
an awful lot of Jews.  The population as a whole,
 with mi nor exceptions, had always been very 
supportive.  And now you™re back
 after the war and you™re no l
onger wearing the star, you™re no 
longer distinguishable from the rest of the popul
ation.  And so there was no need for anybody to 
either bend over backwards or kick
 you in the shins.  So, no, I don™
t think, as a ma
tter of fact, I 
really haven™t dwelled on it much all my life.  
I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust 
survivor and I always detested th
at.  It was one of those things
 that happened, nothing you can do 
about it.  I™m not ashamed of it certainly.  I™
m not proud of it.  I mean, nothing you can do about 
it.  I suppose like most unpl
easant things, you try and put 
them out of your mi nd. 
 

Q: This ma ybe is kind of a digression, going out 
of the chronology, but was there a point where you 
really felt compelled personally to talk about you
r experiences to anyone?  Like that would help 
you or help other people to–? 
 

A: No, never did.  I™ve never been much for psyc
hologists.  (Laughing.)  N
o, I never, and I suppose 
a  lot of the reason I don™t remember  a lot 
of things because they™re pr obably suppressed 
me mory, and why bring it up?   What purpose does it 
serve?   I know a friend 
of mi ne keeps after 
me  to try and write a book.  And I don™t, I sa y absolutely not.  One, there™s not enough to fill a 

page, but aside from that, no, I don™t– ma tte
r of fact, there™s some body c o me  from the 
Holocaust Museum this month.  Di d you see that? 
 

Q: I heard some thing about it. 

 

A: I think it™s, Goldfa rb, is that hi s name? 

 

Q: Marvin, Martin Goldfarb. 

 

A: Yeah, whatever.  It 
is Goldfa rb, isn™t it? 
 

Q: I™m pretty sure.  I™m blanking on his name  right now, but I know hi m.  

 

A: Yeah, okay.  That™s okay.  Okay, that™s all 
right.  I got invitation, I 
don™t know where it came  
from.  It was an invitation to the Holocaust
 survivors in the second generation.  And I was 
debating whether to go or  not.  Because one thing,
 I don™t know any of them that are he re.  And 
I™m not so sure whether I care to or not.  I ha
ven™t ma de up my mi nd.  I 
may decide on the last 
mi nute whether I will or not.

Q: Okay, we have another mi nute or 
so on this tape.  Well, that™s inte
resting.  Your brother has, it 
sounds like, taken kind of an active role in so
me thing that™s related to being a Holocaust 
survivor. 
 
A: Yeah.  And that came about because he saw 
an article in a paper about the Anne Frank 
Foundation and some body™s name  who was, I guess 
the Chairman of the Board, who lived near 
where he lived in Vermont.  And he had never he
ard of the man before and he called him to me et 
him, just out of curiosity.  And apparently they
 got friendly and he got 
him involved in the Anne 
Frank Foundation and he™s on the Board of Direct
ors now, has been for a few years.  And he 
goes around the country every so often ma king speech
es and fundraising and th
at sort of thing.  
And I™m not  sure whether he knew, because l
ooking at his tape , I™m not sure whether he  
me ntioned the name  of t he school that we went to
 or not.  Anyway I don™t reme mber what it is.  
But it was obviously the same  school that Anne Fr
ank went to.  The only thing I reme mber about 

that school is we ma de honey in the Fall.  They
 had bee hives on the roof.  I was thinking about 
that earlier, I don™t know why.  
Whenever it was ready we would 
go upstairs and they would take 
the hives, the honeycombs out and put them in
 a centrifuge and we ma de honey.  And I guess 
carved up the combs and sold it 
with the wax and the honey.   
That™s about the only thing I 
reme mber.  (Laughing.)  There was some thing else
, too, animal-related ab
out that grade school.  
Can™t think of it. 
 

Q: Let™s go ahead and change the tape.

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number two, side A.  And w
ould you say a little bit more about that?   I was 
wondering about, continuing in this
 same  vein of digression, I wa
s wondering about your feeling 
as a Holocaust survivor, whether yo
u feel that there™s any benefit 
to be derived from identifying 
yourself that way?   With the work that your br
other– (Rosenberg bursts 
out laughing)  –it™s a 
strange way of putting the question, isn™t it? 
 

A: No, I tell you reason I am laughing is I suppos
e if you look for sympathy it would be.  But no, I 
don™t.  I™ve never found any benefit to either, oc
casionally if I get pushed I will me ntion it.  I 
norma lly don™t as a ma tter of conversation.  We  
were in Spain and there was a couple in that 
group that we were with, who were Germans, 
who had retired.  He had worked for General 
Motors and they lived in Wi ndsor, across in Cana
da.  And they had invited a friend of theirs 
from Ger ma ny to come  down and join us.  We
 were on the trip up to Granada to see the 
Alhambra.  And on the way back we were sittin
g at a table and this ma n came wande ring in by 
himself.  I said to him in German, ﬁ How are you 
doing? ﬂ   He complained, ﬁNot very well.ﬂ  He  
didn™t speak English, and so unle
ss his friends were around– bla
h, blah, blah.  And then on a 
stop on the way back, we were standing in line 
together and he said, 
ﬁHow come  you speak 
German so well? ﬂ   And I was debating what to say. 
 I just said, ﬁI was in a concentration camp.ﬂ  
And I totally devastated that ma n.  And that evening he sought me  out in the bar and came  to 

apologize.  I said, ﬁHey, it™s not your fault, you were
 too young.ﬂ  This ma n was in his fifties, he 
ma y have be en a child at the time .  ﬁ Oh, please 
come  to Germany,ﬂ he would host us, et cetera, 
et cetera.  So I™m always very careful because there™s no need to upset pe ople that have no, you 

know, no responsibility.  I™m not looking for an advantage.  So no, I  rarely volunteer the 

information. 
 
Q: What about, you™re doing this interview today. 
 You did one other interview.  What has ma de 
you agree to do those? 
 
A: Well, it™s the neo-Nazism that
 says it never happened.  And I 
think there needs to be as much 
evidence as possible to show that
 it really did happen.  And that those ma ny of us who survived 
are perfectly norma l people.  Or what passes for 
normal, at least I think 
so.  (Laughing.)  And 
don™t all go around looking, ﬁHey, you owe me  a favor 
because I survived.ﬂ   But it™s not a bias 
free society.  Until whatever it is, say five 
years ago– I™ve been wanting to go and visit my 
grandparent™s grave.  I just 
couldn™t bring myself the thought
 of going to Germany.  One, 
because it™s Germany; and two, that I wasn™t 
sure whether I could control my temper if 

some body were to say some thing to me  that would 
set me  off.  And so we decided on a trial and 
that was we went to Switzerland for a week with 
day trips out of Lucerne. 
 And the fi rst trip was 
to the Black Forest.  You get out of it for l
unch and you get back on the bus.  The bus was the 
safe haven.  And then another day for a couple of
 hours.  And it went all 
right.  I didn™t feel 
particularly bad or tense.  But 
on that boat trip, after Cologne it 
got to me  suddenly, and I had to 
get out of there.  And I actu
ally during dinner, got up, went 
up on top of the boat, on the top 
deck, to ma ke sure we passed that border back in
to Holland.  Because I ju
st got obsessed all of a 
sudden, panicky.  And have
n™t been back since.

ve you– people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you 
feel like it™s important to you to
 leave them some  kind of inform
ation or some  kind of knowledge 
about your life and your experiences? 
 
A: Well, they know about it, of course.  At least 
one daughter, I think has– n
o, I think they all have 
copies of the tape of the interview.  The tape th
at one of my– it™s really my father™s cousin that  

was much more informative than mi ne or, for th
at matter, my brother™ s.  This fellow got to 
Belsen the day before the liberation or two days
 before the liberation.  The Swedes took him out, 
sent him to Sweden.  He was in a Swedish hospital 
for a year.  But he decided to use that year to 
write down everything he could remember.  And th
en spend the rest of 
his life filling in the 
details that he didn™t reme mber, and try and ge
t the– and he wrote a book.  The original was 
published in German and just before he died, su
pposedly it was published, finally got published 
in English.  And I never did get a co
py of it.  I™ll have to ask my cousin for it.  But I got a copy of 
his tape.  But he reme mb ers name s and dates and–
 and he went from one  labor camp to another 

labor camp, and the name  of the commander of th
e camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no 
idea about and really, don™
t really care.  And yeah, my kids 
know, but they also really have no 
relation to it. My youngest daughter couldn™t, when
 I said some thing to her about the Vi etnam 
War, she says, ﬁBut Dad I was only six then.ﬂ  
You know, s o it™s all ancien
t history.  Just like 
World Wa r One is ancient history to me .  I know
 about it.  I™m a bit of a history buff and I 
wanted to see the Bosporus.  That™s a World Wa r 
One site.  The British took one hell of a beating 
there.  That was Churchill™s do
ing.  And went to Yalta, wanted 
to see that.  But no, they™re not 
really interested. 
 

Q: Did you intentionally at some  point
 start telling your children about–? 
 

A: No,no. 
 
Q: –your history?   It ju
st kind of gradually–? 
 

A: I™m not sure.  My wife ma y have told them 
something or my  mother may have.  It may have 
come  out, a comment here or there or some thing 
that occurred that ma de me  bring it up or a 
program that I watched.  Spielberg had a program, wa
s it last week or week before last, it was on 
HBO.  I was  going to tape it, but I don™t have 
HBO.  When there™s something on the Holocaust  I 
usually tape it.  More for my in
for ma tion than to show others. 
 

Q: And I™m cur i ous about what you mentioned a 
little earlier about some one who you know who™s a 
professional Holocaust survivor. 
 

A: That was my cousin. 

 

Q: Your cousin?    

 

A: Well, my father™s cousin.   

 

Q: And is that some thing– and you me ntioned that
 it bothers you.  Can you say more about what 
bothers you about that or what you 
think the danger
 of that is?

A: Oh, I don™t think there™s danger 
in it, it ma y bore people to deat
h, but you can do that with other 
things, too.  That was the singular
 defining incident of his life. 
 And everything is being related 
to that.  I– that ma y have been the most impor
tant event in my life, 
even though I don™t think 
so.  I think there are mu ch more i mportant things, 
I mean it™s part of my history.  I was fortunate 
that I survived it, and 
I moved on.  I don™t particularly dwell 
on it.  Or try and say, ﬁNow wait a 
mi nute, I married that woman because I didn™t 
see that woma n–ﬂ or you know, and relate it to 
the Holocaust.  It has nothing to do with it.  We
ll, in his case everything was.  It came  up in 
every conversation. 
 

Q: And have you had the experience as some body w
ho has survived the Holocaust, of people ma ybe 
assumi ng that because you are a Holocaust survivor that was the defining event of your life and 

therefore kind of ma ybe  
not seeing you clearly? 
 

A: No, because I doubt whether anybody that woul
d know me  or that I would know, would find out 
that I am a Holocaust survivor until they really
 have known me  for a long time.  Because it™s, see 
I don™t normally bring it up.  Not unless some thi
ng happens to ma ke it pop up for some reason or 
another, inadvertently, but no, I w
ouldn™t think so.  They just see 
the lack of hair.  (Laughing.) 
 

Q: Is being Jewish important to you? 

 

A: Yeah, definitely.  I am 
the only Jew in my fa mily. 
 

Q: Is that right? 

 

A: Yes.  (Laughing.)  And I am proud of it. 
 
Q: So, what does that mean to you, 
to be the only Jew in your family? 

 

A: Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously.  My 
wife is Episcopalian.  Our children were baptized 
in the Episcopalian church, but are not particul
arly religious.  My younge
st daughter was ma rried 
in the Catholic chur ch and now her children were 
just baptized in the last month, because they 
want– the older one now is going to
 first grade.  And with the pub
lic schools here in Louisville 
in such a me ss, they want to put the boy into 
parochial school.  And they belong to a parish and 
apparently they are now going to church regularl
y, which is fine.  I have no problem with it one 
way or the other.  Our oldest daughter was ma rried
 for the fi rst time in the Episcopal cathedral in 
Lexington, which as you ma y know is so or
thodox that the ma ss was in Latin.   
 

Q: They don™t even do that
 in Catholic church. 
 

A: I know.  (Laughing.)  That ma rriag
e didn™t last and her current husba
nd is a Baptist.  I™m not sure 
that they are going to church, but
 their son goes to Bible school
.  He was in, going to public 
school, not this Fall, but he was in a Baptist 
kindergarten and presc
hool.  And the other one 
doesn™t have any children and as far as I know, th
ey were ma rried by a minister who was, whom 
they knew.  So that™s why I™m saying that.

Q: So, what does it mean to you, can you say what it means to you to be Jewish? 
 

A: No, not really.  No more so than what it m
eans being a chemist or of Ger man extraction or 
ma rried or gr andfather or  anythi ng else.  You be
tter not say anything anti-Semitic or I™ll blow 
your head off.  (Laughing.)  But other than that, no.  
 

Q: It doesn™t necessarily mean keeping ce
rtain traditions or going to synagogue? 
 

A: Not really, no, no.  Keep certain traditions, but
 I– bit of a pragma tist,
 and I™m not all that 
tradition- bound.  I think the dietary laws make 
good sense from a health perspective, but I don™t 
particularly find the need
 to avoid eating shrimp. 
 

Q: What about, do you think of Judaism as a– when 
you say it™s important to you to be Jewish, is it 
as a religion? 
 

A: Well it™s really more ethnic than a religion. 
 Did you by chance see that program on trying to find 
the lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS?   Fascina
ting program.  To some  people being Jewish is a 

religion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr
. is probably the– Elizabeth Ta
ylor.  But to– I would think 
most Jews, it™s more ethnic than religious.  
You can™t help whatever 
your racial or ethnic 
background is.  I™m not hiding it and I™m not fla
unting it.  So, I don™t care.  You know, whether 
some body knows or doesn™t know.  It™s not that I 
don™t care personally, what I mean is I™m not 

concerned about it. 
 

Q: So you™re not a particul
arly religious person?   
 

A: No, I™m not. 
 
Q: Okay.  Let™s go pick up the timeline again. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: We left off i n Amsterdam just after the war. 
 You™re going back to school, you™re working hard 
at being a student.  And as far as, you were talk
ing about being hopeful at the time.  What were 
you, do you recall what you were hopeful for, what you 
really wanted for the rest of your life? 
 

A: Well, initially to graduate from high school
, you know, trying to pass 
the exams or get far 
enough along that I would be allowed to take th
e exams.  And then once they decided that I 
could, then of course sweating lik
e everybody else to pass them.  But I did.  I wanted to become  
a chemist or a chemical engineer.  And after 
I graduated from high sc
hool I went to Delft, 
Technical Institute in Delft for 
one year, ‚46, ‚47, to study chemical engineering.  Then much to 
my dis may, my parents decided to
 come  to the United States and 
I didn™t want to go.  We ll for 
one thing, you had to leave your friends, just gett
ing into the swing of things having done my 
freshman ye ar in college.  But they didn™t give 
me a choice, and so then of course the logical 
thing was– a lot of my mother™s family and some
 of my da d™s family were over here, had been 
over here for years, so we came ove
r here in ‚47, Memorial Day, ‚47.

Q: Did you consider not comi ng and stay
ing?   By then you were an adult. 
 
A: Oh yeah, yeah.  Not comi ng, I said, I wasn™t 
given that option.  I sa
id, ﬁOkay, I™ll go with you, 
but I™m going to go back.ﬂ  You get used to– 
it™s a changed situation, and I probably didn™t 

really give it much serious thought after some  
months or some  years to go back.  Go ahead. 
 

Q: Did you have any– what were your no
tions about the U.S. at that time? 
 

A: Well, you know the only notions you have are th
e cowboys, and the skyscrapers of New York.  
And since it was Memorial Day when we got he
re, the night before traveling along the South 
shore of Long Island you saw the fireworks. 
 Of c ourse, you didn™t know what was going on.  
Memorial Day didn™t me an anything to us.  Then
 it was hot.  I™m not sure if it was hot for 
Memorial Day, but like it is right now.  It was 
one of these early hot spells.  Our, my mother™s 
brothers came  and picked us up, me t us at the 
boat, and took us over to my mother™s sister™s 
apartment. 
 

Q: Where was that? 

 

A: In New York, New Yor k City.  My mother was 
one of 13 brothers and sisters.  And one, two, 
three– four sisters were in the United States
, and three of her brot
hers.  And the three, 
three
 
sister s and the three brothers lived in New York 
City.  And my dad™s sist er,  I think she may still 

have been in Rochester at the time.  I™m not 
sure.  And ma tter of fact
, they had written, my 
mother™s brothers had gotten an apartment for us
, which was across the street from one and next-
door to one of the other ones.  In Queens, in New 
York City.  And so we lived there.  I guess, but 
I™m not sure, we stayed with my aunt for a while
 until our furniture arrived, because I™m not sure 

it was on the same  boat.  It came later. 
 I don™t reme mber, it™s been a long time. 
 

Q: So, you came by ship? 

 

A: Oh Yeah, yeah.  The Veyndam 
(ph )
 was the name of the ship. 
 

Q: Dutch? 

 

A: It was a Holland-America Line freighter built 
in 1914.  I looked it up rece
ntly, that™s why I can 
spout that stuff.  (Laughing.)  It was requisi
tioned during Wor l d Wa r Two and was used as a 
troop ship.  And then this was the last trip across 
the Atlantic to the States
 to be reconverted, to 
have all of the bunks and all that
 stuff taken out and be converted back to a freighter and was 
retired in 1954.  I couldn™t reme mber  the name
 of the ship.  I looked it up in the New York 
Time s a year or two ago.  They had the comi ngsand goings of all the ship
s and they listed them 
in the New York Time s.  Listed as May 30
th
, Memorial, May 30
th
 with 112 passengers. 
 

Q: You reme mber anythi
ng about the journey? 
 

A: Oh yes.  (Laughing.)  The– I™m not sure how
 ma ny, 20 or so people could live in the cabins and 
my parents had a cabin.  Most of us were dow
n in the hold and like a
ll troop ships, you know, 
seven stacks.  And we used the bottom one or
 the second bottom one, there was nobody there.

21
And it was pretty good until the weather got roug
h.  We  really got tossed around and that day 
that we got tossed around the di
nner was bacon and beans.  I ju
st stayed in the bunk.  But one 
fellow, he was a big eater.  He never mi ssed a 
me al and he came charging down the steps, threw 
his teeth on the bunk and ran back up and fed the 
fish.  Then he came back, got his teeth, and 
went back to eat the second time.  (Laughing.)  Th
at™s about all.  It wa
s a long trip.  It was 14 
days, the ship was slow.  But th
at™s all I reme mber.  It was un
rema rkable.  Left from Antwerp, 
stopped in South Hampt on to Hoboken, which was the Holland-American Line termi nal.  Ellis 
Island had been closed about a month or two ear
lier, so we didn™t come  through Ellis Island. 
 

Q: Re me mber first impressions of New York? 

 

A: Hot, hot and dirty.  Of course the high rise, 
and the frantic activity, ca
rs going everywhere.   
 

Q: How was yo ur English? 

 

A: Non-existent or very poor.  We ll, I had high 
school English.  But didn™
t have much choice, had 
to learn in a hurry, because I got a job within a w
eek as a lab technician at
 Mount Sinai Hospital.  
Paid the glorious wage of 100 dollars a month.  
And we had to work half day Saturdays.  And 
then we took, had to take– we didn™t have to, 
we took turns taking calls 
on the weekends.  That 
paid an extra six dollars.  And the girls all were 
more interested in going to the beach, so I took 
all of their calls, because I needed the six dollars 
more than I needed a suntan.  And then I got a 
ticket.  Two weeks in this country
 and I got a ticket.  That was Saturday morning, going to work, 
I was going down the subway and a cop stopped me
.  I didn™t know what he wanted.  I didn™t 
understand enough of what he was saying.  And so
 I pulled my passport out and I opened it on 
the immi gration stamp to show him I don™t, you 
know it was two weeks.  I did understand what 
identification was.  And so he proceeded to writ
e and tore this thing out, gave me  my passport 
back and tore this thing out and 
told me it was a ticket.  Well the only meaning of the word ticket 
I knew was admi ssion to a theater.  Didn™t want
 to, don™t have time to 
go.  Tried to explain– 
finally ma de me  take it, he told me  I didn™t ha
ve to go myself, I could give it to some body else.  

When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work
 with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket.  He 
said what for?   (Laughing.)  I told him I di
dn™t know, but a cop had given it to me .  So he 

explained to me  that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the 

end of the fiscal year and he had to ma ke his 
quota, so he wa s writing tickets furiously and I 
guess I looked like a good sucker for one.  And wh
en I became  a citizen 
you have to list all non-
moving traffic violations excepted.  So I went back
 to court to find out what the heck I had done.  
Whatever it was, violation of city code some thi
ng or other, disposition, tw
o dollars.  Fine of two 
dollars, that was it.  But it™s on my records.   
 

Q: It™s not on your record
s as having, the infraction wa
s not listed on your records? 
 

A: No, I had to list it on my
 citizenship application. 
 

Q: I mean the cause of the ticket being given. 

 

A: Oh it listed whatever it was, th
e code violation, but I have no 
idea what it was that I did.  You 
know, hopscotch down the steps into the subway
, who knows what it was.  The reason you had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

22
to be so careful– in the ‚30s and ‚40s, well pr
ior to let™s say the ‚50s and ‚60s, anti-Semitism 
was an acceptable feeling in this country.  
And the State Department was so strongly anti-

Semitic, they saw it as their function to keep 
as ma ny Jews out as they could, not to try and 
rescue as ma ny and let them in. 
 And the Immi gration Service di
dn™t help matters either.  An 
uncle of mi ne when he went for his hearing wa
s asked for his convictions
.  He said he didn™t 
have any.  The judge says, ﬁThink it over and come  
back in six months.ﬂ  This went on twice.  
You know, what the hell are you talking about?  
 We ll, it turned out that there was some body 
with the same name , apparently, who had gotte
n a parking ticket in Buffalo, New Yor k.  And 
they accused him of lying because
 he didn™t list it.  And he 
said, ﬁI don™t even know where 
Buffalo is and I don™t have an auto
mobile.ﬂ  So they finally– but
 his citizenship was delayed for 
a year over so mething like that. 
 

Q: And you think it was because he was Jewish that they–? 

 

A: Oh sure.  There wasn™t any– they put a lot 
of barriers in the way.  
Of course then too, you 
know, the rules were a little diffe
rent.  You had to be a resident for five years.  You had to 
demonstrate your fluency in English, not like toda
y where they™ll give it to you in Spanish or 
French or whatever.  And lastly you had to demo
nstrate a knowledge of American history.  And 
the Daughters of the American Revolution used 
to give courses in American history for 
foreigners.  Who was the 23
rd
 president?   They asked my dad to name  the 13 original colonies.  
And he got as far as one or two, I reme mber
, and the judge said, 
ﬁGuess I asked the wrong 
person, 
you
 tell me.ﬂ  Well, I star ted 
out with Georgia going up the 
coast, because I could never 
reme mber whether it™s Maine or New Ha mpshire.
  (Laughing.)  And he stopped me  when I got 
to Vermont.  So I got off easy.  I got at least 
12 of the 13.  And he asked me, I still don™t know 
why that was the wrong answer, he asked me , ﬁ Why 
do we celebrate the Fourth of July? ﬂ  I said, 

ﬁBecause it™s Independence Day.ﬂ  That wasn™t 
the right answer.  I™m not sure what it was 
supposed to be.  But they were 
pretty strict and– depending on 
the judge, most of those were 
not all that bad.  But there was– well Dupont di
d not hire its first Je
w until World Wa r  Two.  
And when I graduated from college in ‚54, Armst r ong-Quartz 
(ph )
 still didn™t hire Jews.  It was 
that pervasive still. 
 

Q: When was your citizenship? 

 

A: ‚52.  Matter of fact, my brot
her couldn™t become  a citizen beca
use he was not in the country.  
You had to be in the country.  He was in the military.  He had been drafted.  He couldn™t become  

a citizen because he was not in the United States.   
 

Q: So you in those years, those first years that you came  to the U.S– you came in ‚47? 

 

A: ‚47. 

 

Q: Were you, you were aware of having 
to be very cautious as a Jew?

Tape 2, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape two, side B.   

 

A: Well in New York there really was very little 
that you could or couldn™t do as such.  But being 
ignorant as to the American way, I asked a girl in
 one of my classes at 
City College for a date 
and she turned me  down flat.  She was Italianand I was Jewish and it 
just didn™t go.  I didn™t 
know that.  I applied for admi ssion to Columbia 
and RPI, Rensselaer in Albany, Schenectady.  
And I was turned down.  In one instance, the 
Dutch quota was filled.  You know, all kinds of 
barriers that existed that you ran 
into either unwittingly or stupid
ly, whichever, for me  mostly 
unwittingl y.  Natives would have known bette
r and would have avoided the– either 
embarrassment or whatever 
you want to call it.   
 

Q: What were your parents 
doing once they arrived here? 
 

A: My– you were, you had to come  with a job offer and the company that my dad had worked for 
in Berlin in the thirties ha d a– what was then 
a branch in New York, which then or now was of 
course was the only office.  And they had offered 
him a job there and so he went to work there 
the second day we were here or after the first w
eek we were here.  And I had gotten the job at 
Mount Sinai Hospital.  My brot
her got a job some where, I don™
t reme mber.  And so everybody 
worked. 
 

Q: And you all shared an apartment? 

 

A: Yes, we lived with my parents and since we 
were– I™ve been thinking ab
out that, and of course, 
never asked.  But we were expected to contri
bute to the household.  And I™m not sure whether 
that was a ma tter of need or a ma
tter of discipline.  That you live 
here, you gotta pay for it.  Earn 
money, your share, which was no problem.  Onc e  in th
e Fall, I started at night
 at the City College 
of New York, went to night school and worked
 during the day.  Did that all the way through. 
 

Q: How did you end up feeling about this country
?   You hadn™t been happy to come .  Did you end 
up feeling, at some  point feel at home here? 
 

A: Oh yeah, very quickly, certainly.  And I don™t 
want you to think that I 
was paranoid about these 
barriers that you ran into.  It wa
s just ignorance, you learn from 
it.  One of my uncles took me  
aside and gave me  the fa cts of life.  That there ar
e some  things that Jews can™t do in this country.  
(Clock chimes with bird-call.) 
 

Q: Cardinal?  That means it™s three o™clock? 

 

A: That™s right.  (Laughing.)  I guess you didn™t hear
 the two o™clock bird.  It™s like the rules in, 
whether you like them or not you have to abide by
 them.  You™re not supposed to drive more 
than 65 miles an hour.  And then New York bei
ng such a big place you can avoid unpleasantries.  
There™s no need to go looking for them.

Q: Did it strike you as hypocritical?  
 Or did you think about that?   Th
is so-called Home  of the Free, 
discrimi nating against–? 
 
A: No, frankly, no, no, I really never thought about
 it.  There are some  
things that you– I guess it 
really wasn™t very impor tant.  They were mi nor in
conveniences.  It wasn™t any big deal.  I can™t 
complain about that. 
 

Q: So, what happened next?   You™re going to schoo
l at night and you™re work
ing in the day.  And–  
 

A: Trying to get better jobs.  Getti
ng paid more.  And then I, of c
ourse, the Korean War started and I 
had to go for my physical.  I was classified 1-A to
 begin with before I ever took the physical.  
And then trying to get a student deferment.  I had 
a very nasty Draft Board that ma de all kinds of 
unpleasant rema rks whe n I went for a hearing for a student defer ment, about ﬁWhat™s the ma tter, 

don™t you want to shoot some  Chinks?ﬂ  You know, that
 sort of thing.  I graduated in January of 
‚51.  And went on to Graduate school, and they 
just gave me  fits all the way through.  They 

would re-classify me  1- A, had to appeal it.  Then
 they would get it back
 to a student deferment 
for six mont hs, but retroactive to a date of– so 
half the time  I was deferred, half the time  I 
wasn™t, which was a real distracti
on while in school.  But I made 
it through all right.  Didn™t even 
think about it, I went to work for Shell Oi
l Company and that was deferrable employment 

because of the oil industry.  Of course the war 
was pretty well over by that time anyway, ‚54.   
 

Q: Would you have felt willing to go and fight in 
the Korean War if you hadn™t been involved in 
this student– or what were 
your feelings behind that? 
 

A: Not very happy about it.  I wasn™t even a citi
zen.  As a ma tter of fact
, my brother, who was 
drafted, he did not go to school, he wa s actually 
sent to Germany.  And when this citizenship 
hearing came up, he couldn™t, because he was overs
eas.  I mean, that™s the most preposterous 
thing.  He was in the U.S. Ar my therefore he 
couldn™t become  a citizen.  But not particularly 
happy about it.  Wa sted enough time in my life alr
eady without having to serve a few more years 

in the Army.  But no, I wasn™t particularly, I wasnot unwilling.  I mean, I wasn™t going to refuse.  

But I wasn™t going to volunteer either. 
 

Q: When and how did you meet your wife? 

 

A: We lived in the same  house.  We ll, I have to sa
y that I was too poor to live in the dormitory and 
three of us shared an apartment. 
 

Q: I™m sorry, what school was it? 

 

A: This was at Duke, at Duke University in Du
rham.  And this is one of these old, you know, like 
old Louisville.  Big homes and they ma de it into
 a number of apartments.  We had one apartment 

upstairs, it was a Divinity st
udent and his wife.  Another ap
artment upstairs and the landlady 
rented out one of the apartments
 downstairs to Alice and her room
mate.  That™s how we met.  I 
was at Duke, she was working.  She was a la
b technician working at the VA hospital. 
 

Q: And what was your ma jor at Duke?

A: Chemistry. 

 

Q: Aparticulart
ype of chemistry? 
 

A: Analytical chemistry.  That™s what I 
used to do for a living for a long time .   
 

Q: Had you thought– well it sounds like 
you didn™t have any feelings as
 far as dating a Jew versus 
a non-Jew or caring a lot on that?    
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Was your family equally indifferent? 

 

A: I think so.  My dad certainly was, my mother, 
I™m not so sure.  I don™t th
ink any girl would have 
been good enough for my mother.   
 

Q: Did you ever talk within your fa mily about what
 had happened during the wa
r or was this kind of 
a moot subject? 
 

A: No, oh no, no.  They uh, no, certainly not.  The
y, well as I me ntioned, my mother is one of 
thirteen children, two of them were killed in 
World Wa r One.  Of the rema ining eleven, three 

brothers were here and four si
sters.  And the one brother was 
picked up during the Kristallnacht 
thing in ‚38 and taken to Dach
au.  And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he 
wouldn™t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather 

than having him die there.  And he died at home.
  And they decided they
 better get th
eir son out 
before he™s going to get it too.  
But my mother™s sister-in-law w
ith her daughter stayed and they 
perished.  And another sister and her husband had 
moved to Belgium in the early ‚30s.  He was a 
very prosperous furniture ma nufacturer.  They 
had two daughters.  And they actually helped one 

of the other sisters™ children, th
ey ma naged to get out, I guess, as
 late as ™42, by way of Belgium 

and through Portugal.  They stayed for a while w
ith them.  But that c
ouple with their children, 
the sister, they perished. As a ma
tter of fact, I had documentation of
 them at one time, their death 
certificates.  And then on my father™s side, 
my grandmother, my dad™s mother, lived in 
Amsterdam also.  And she had cardiac problems so 
bad, she couldn™t have walked from here to 
the front door without taking ni
troglycerine, but she 
survived the cattle ca
r ride to the gas 
chambers and died at Auschwitz.  And one of, hi
s sister was he re, but hi
s brother was still in 
Germany and he perished.  And so no, we, and fo
rtunately for my mother™s, my grandmother, 
my ma ternal grandmother, she died in late ‚
44, so she never did find out
 what happened to her 
children, those that were in Europe.  But no, th
at was a common topic of conversation in the 
fa mily.  My– the son that was sent over, he we
nt back to his hometown looking for his parents 
or for his mother and sister.  He was in the Arm
y.  Some  of my other cousins that were in the 
Ar my went looking for the relatives and for us. 
 Of course once we got back to Holland, my 
parents, my mother contacted her sisters, and le
t them know t hat we had survived.  Of course, 
they also asked to see if we could find out from 
t here what happened to th
e other relatives.  And 
there™s the extended family as I me ntioned, my dad™s cousin, his parents did not survive.

Q: What was his name ?  
 

A: Robertson, he – (Laughing.) I™m laughing becau
se you ask about the name .  His name  was 
Rosenberg also and when he was in the hospital in Sweden a ma n ca me  in, a British Army 

officer and said to him, ﬁ Are you Hans Rosenberg? ﬂ   He said yes.  He said, ﬁI™m Peter 

Robertson, your brother.ﬂ  (Laughing.)  He ha
d been sent out and was drafted in the British 

Ar my and they wouldn™t allow the name  Rosenbe
rg.  Because in the event of he would be 

captured by the Germans that they wouldn™t– he
 wanted to just anglicize it and ma ke it 
Montrose, but there™s a Lord Montrose and you™re
 not allowe d to use the name  of a famous 
person, so they ma de it Robertson.  And so then when he came over here and became a citizen he 

decided so he would have the same  name  as hi
s brother he changed his name  to Rober t son. 
 

Q: What was his first name? 

 

A: Henry,Hans. 

 

Q: Okay, and this is the same  one who you 
me ntioned earlier, who had written the book? 
 

A: Yes, right.   

 

Q: So, most of your fa mily™s conversation then, 
when you were talking about wartime issues was 
concerned with what had become  of various 
family me mbers and tracking people down and 
ma king– 
 

A: Fa mily me mbers, to some  extent, property, the ca
rpet which is in our family room used to belong 
to my parents and then of course, the Germans got it.  And my  dad was, some ti me , I™ m not sure 
when, in the fifties, he was in Holland on busines
s and he saw it hanging in a carpet store in the 
window.  And he went in and said, ﬁThat™s my 
carpet.ﬂ  Fellow says, ﬁTough luck, it cost you so 
much,ﬂ whatever it was.  He took a picture of
 it, but it di dn™t do any good, because as I said 
earlier, the Dutch didn™t want to 
transfer the victim from one to
 another.  But they ended up 
buying it again.  And then 
I got it after my mother died.  Th
ere are other things that come  up 
occasiona lly or would come  up about  some thing that was mi ssing, or wondering where it was.  I 
had a fairly nice stamp c ollecti
on that I had given to a friend for safekeeping.  And all the 
valuable stamps are gone.  You know, you can be 
harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on 
the other hand, they ma y have traded it for foodand needed it.  They didn™t know whether you 

were going to come  back or not.  The only one th
at was absolutely and scrupulously honest was 
the concierge of the business where my dad worke
d.  He had everything  that my dad entrusted 
to him and gave every bit of it back.  Where ma ny
 of your so-called friends denied they ever had 
anything.  And there™s one thing that™s unfort
unate and I didn™t know about it until fairly 
recently.  Apparently my mother ha
d written a long letter to one of 
her sisters, or  ma ybe to all of 
them, sa me  letter addressed to all of them, aboutthe deprivation, et cetera, et cetera.  She said 

her ambition was to die in her own bed between cl
ean sheets.  And that letter wasn™t di scovered 
until one of my cousins, one of the sister™sdaughters, who live d on Long Island, but was moving 

to Florida and was going through th
e stuff to throw things away 
and came across that letter and 
gave it to– I think there ma y be 
one or two pages mi ssing.  But it was not until a year or so, two 
years after my mother had died.  And that explai
ned a lot of things to us.  But fortunately we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
27
 
 
 
27
were able to do that unknowingly.  
She died at home  in her own bed. 
 It was diffi cult to do it that 
way, but– 
 
Q: From where had she written the letter? 

 

A: From Holland after the war, she had wrote that 
to her sisters, describi
ng what had happened to 
some  extent during the war and the deprivations
 and how that was her ambition.  She wrote in 
there, ﬁI wasn™t going to give 
those bastards the pleasure of throwing me  into a ma ss grave.  I 
want to die in my own bed betw
een clean sheets.ﬂ  Probably one of
 the reasons for our survival 
was my mot her™s st rong will.  I think that had a lo
t to do with it.  Probably didn™t realize it at the 
time. 
 

Q: More so than your father™s?   
Or your father was more of a– 
 

A: Much more easier-going person, yeah.   

 

Q: Was your family very close after you came to the States? 

 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.  Not only– you talki
ng my parents and my brother and I, or overall 
the relatives?    
 

Q: Both. 

 

A: Oh yeah, yes definitely, and still am.  I mean ther
e aren™t that many of us le
ft .  But I talk to some 
of my cousins on a fairly regular basis.  We  don
™t see each ot her all that
 often because  we™re now 
scattered.  A few years ago in Spring we decidedto ma ke a round-trip to Fl orida and visit Alice™s 
brother and then take a few days on the beach and th
en went to visit some of my cousins.  When 
everybody lived in New York, when all they lived 
in New York I would see them whenever I got 
to New York once a year, but now they™re scatte
ring too.  Retiring and dying, too.  Not all of us 
are alive anymore in our generation.   
 

Q: When you me t your wife, did she have any idea of
 what your history had been during the war?   
Did you talk about that during 
your courtship at all?    
 

A: I don™t think so, I don™t think so.  You™d 
have to ask her, but I don™t think so.   
 

Q: And did that become  a, la
ter, as you recall, a topic–? 
 

A: That never became an issue, no, not really.  N
o, it would have to have only become  a topic of 
conversation– well it did.  I had back problems,
 it™s now, what?   30-some  years ago.  And when 
I asked the surgeon what, was th
ere any indication what the caus
e was.  And he said, without 
knowing what my background was, he says, ﬁY
eah, severe malnutriti
on during your growing 
years.ﬂ  But other than that, 
norma lly it was not a topic of– 
 

Q: Does she ask you at all about 
it now or in recent years?    
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
28
 
 
 
28
A: No,no. 
 

Q: Does she know now?    

 

A: Oh yeah, she knows.  I™m sure my mother
 told her probably a number of things, and 
occasiona lly– well, she™s seen the vi deos also.  A
ll the ki ds have seen them.  I™ m pretty sure, I 
may even have made copies for them.  They™re 
aware of it, but it™s just a piece of history, not 
ﬁtheﬂ.  A lot of difference there. 
 

Q: So, what happened after you 
got ma rried?   Did you move? 
 

A: Yeah, we– a bit hectic few days.  I had myPh.D. orals on Thursday and a final in a class on 
Monday.  We got ma rried on Tuesday and we left
 during that, after the 
we dding and went around 
the coast of Houston, where I had to report for 
work a little less than two weeks later. 
 

Q: ForShell? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: What were you doing for Shell? 

 

A: I was a research chemist.  I stayed there for five
 years.  I didn™t like wh
at I was doing and started 
looking for another job and got a 
job with GE in Cincinnati and was there for almost ten years 
and then got transferred down here.   
 

Q: Where were your parents and 
your brother during those years? 
 

A: My parents, my dad actually di
ed in ‚67 of a second heart attac
k.  And my  mother lived in New 
York, New York City.  My brother, after he got 
out of the Service in ea
rly ‚53, got a job with a 
Dutch Ore company that had holdings all over th
e world.  And ma tter of fact that™s why he 
changed his name .  His last name  is Rosley, R O 
S L E Y.  He anglicized it so he wouldn™t be 

mi staken for a German a fter the war, when there 
was still a lot of anti-Ge
rman feeling allthrough 
the world.  He was essentially ove
rseas in one place or anot he r until 1963, I believe, is when he 
came back after having been in Brazil for a number
 of years.  And he lived in New York then 
until he  retired, oh, some  ten years or so ago and 
moved to Vermont.  Wh ere he st ill officially 
lives in Vermont. 
 

Q: What was your real interest as far as your pr
ofession?   Did you have 
any kind of guiding thing 
that you really loved to do? 
 

A: Problem-solving using chemistry 
as a tool to solve a lot of 
technical problems.  That was 
probably my forte.  I was pret
ty good at it, at the time.   
 

Q: So you were seeking work that, in which you were
 really able to do more of the problem solving 
type than– what didn™t you like abou
t the job that you had in Texas? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012

29
A: Shell?   We ll, it was a particular developmen
t scheme , you took one step forward and ma ybe two 
backwards.  It just got to be 
a bore.  And I asked for a differe
nt assignment and they said, ﬁNo, 
no, you™re doing too well.  You™re getting wherewe want you to go.ﬂ  And I didn™t want to go 
there.  And so I started to look for some thing else
.  And the most interesting job that I was being 
considered for was with the Navy in San Francisc
o.  But the chief of that office was on a year™s 
sabbatical in Belgium and they 
weren™t going to ma ke a decisi
on until he came back.  And I 
wasn™t going to wait another year. 
 And the assignme nt that they ta
lked to me  about in Cincinnati 
was pretty interesting.  And I had a good time.  It 
was nerve-racking, because I didn™t realize it at 
the time, it was ACE, the Atomic
 Energy Commi ssion was the primary contractor.  And so it was 
at the whims of the governme nt.  And two years 
after I was up there we
 went overnight from 
three thousand to three hundred em
ployees.  Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they 
kept.  I finally decided this is getting too mu
ch, these ups and downs, and mostly downs.  And 

there was another one comi ng, so
 I decided to look around the 
company for other possible 
opportunities and they happened to have an openi
ng down here, so I appl
ied for it and got it. 
 

Q: This is st ill for GE? 

 

A: Yeah, in the appliance business he
re as an analytical chemist.  A
nd then a year later or two years 
later, I was made manager of 
analytical chemistry, chemistry and processe s.  But anyway, 
essentially a multitude of problems.   
 

Q: Did you have any preconceived notio
ns about living in Kentucky?    
 

A: Well– (Laughing) funny, because we talked about
 it ye sterday.  While we were still living in 
Ohio, the Riverfront Stadium was the big issue. 
 It was being built, wher e to build it.  They 
started construction.  And they said when they 
got done with that they 
were going to build the 
biggest zoo in the world.  They
 were going to put a fence arou
nd Kentucky.  So, that answers 
that question, right?  No, not re
ally, didn™t know much about it. 
 I was commuting for about six 
weeks, no, longer than that, two mo nths.  And so 
got acquainted a little b
it with the area while I 
was still living up there.  And there wasn™t that 
much difference.  People are people everywhere.  
And a pretty nice group of people he
re that I worked with and worked for.  Matter of fact, I™m 
still friends with, fairly good frie
nds with one of my for mer bosses.  And I™m particularly happy 

about that. 
 

Q: For your community of friends, you sa
id– when did you mo ve to Louisville? 
 

A: ‚68, a little over 32 years ago. 

 

Q: And your community of friends and so forth 
here are most, acquaintances here are mos tly 
through work or–? 
 

A: Work, neighbors, people I worked with or for, 
or that worked for me , neighbors, people who live 
in the area or me t at the swimming pool, or wife 
was in a bridge club.  And still have friends 
from Cincinnati days, too.  In fact, one of our
 good friends, who was a ne
ighbor in Cincinnati, 
now lives in Fort Worth.  Known him for 35 years ma ybe.

Q: And no involveme nt with a synagogue here? 
 

A: No, not particularly.  Now I™m on ev
ery Jewish or ganization™s mailing list. 
 

Q: Why is that? 

 

A: There was an article in the Courier Journal,
 ma ybe a year ago, whenever it was, about the 
Temple and how the Temple needed expansion a
nd they were going to have a quiet campaign for 
construction funds, for building funds.  So, I sent 
them a check with a note attached that ﬁSince 
you™re having a quiet campaign I™m sending you a ch
eck on the QT.ﬂ  And got a very nice letter 
back, as a ma tter of fact, a friend of mi ne w
ho is  quite involved with the Temple, the lady 
showed him the letter not 
knowing that we knew each other.  Bu
t that got me on the mailing list 
for every Jewish organization locally, of
 course mostly asking for money. 
 

Q: And you me ntioned a little bi
t earlier about how you don™t real
ly have contact with other 
Holocaust survivors in the area.  And you™re not sure you want to. 
 

A: Not on that basis.  I mean, I™m not saying that 
I say, ﬁYou™re a Holocaust survivor, move aside, I 
don™t want a part of it.ﬂ  What I™m saying is, if
 I happen to meet some body who also is, I have no 

problem with that.  That™s just–   
 
End of Tape 2, Side B

31
Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: Okay, this is tape number three, side A of 
an interview with Alexander Rosenberg.  You were 
just saying about the Holocaust survivors in Loui
sville.  Did you want to 
add anything else to 
what you had said? 
 
A: No not really, as I say, I™m deba
ting on whether to go to this meeti
ng just out of curiosity.  See, I 
don™t think I know anybody– well, I™m pretty sure I don™
t.  I™m sure they have to be all older 
folks.  (Laughing.)  So I ma y.  I haven™t decided ye
t.  But no, no special in
terest as a criterion. 
 

Q: How about other, just
 looking back over your year
s here after the war in the United States.  We re 
you really mainly just focusing on your work and 
your fa mily or did you have other interests or 
passions outside of that? 
 

A: Oh yeah, I have a numbe r of hobbies.  For one 
thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat.  
(Laughing.)  And gardening, although my garden right
 now doesn™t show that
.  And I always like 
to travel, but of course, with a family and work 
that isn™t always possible.  So we ma de up for it 
since I retired.  And I 
enjoy history, learning about it, lear
ned more about it since I retired, I 
guess. Now I have time  to watch television a
nd the History channel and A&E and of course, 
KET to some extent.  So that– a lot more exposur
e and therefore an ability to learn a lot more.  
And then too, when we travel, we
 do it with the intent, not alwa
ys the same .  I don™t go for these 
Caribbean cruises, you know, ﬁShow 
me , feed me, entertain me .ﬂ  
I like cruises because they are 
a lazy ma n™s way of travelingŠyou only pack and 
unpack onceŠbut there has to be a reason for 
it.  And sometimes they are r
eal eye-openers.  A couple of 
years we went on an Eastern 
Mediterranean and Black Sea cruise
 and we were in Constanta, Ro
mania, which is the major port 
of Roma nia on the Black Sea.  Ovid was exiled th
ere for seven years or  whatever.  Well, never 
even thought that the Roma ns as wel l  as the 
Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black 
Sea, east coast of the Balkan Peni
nsula.  And that they had gone th
at far North into what is now 
Odessa and to the Crimea.  I™m sure it™s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical 

event, just didn™t think about that 
or heard about it.  A lot of thi
ngs like that.  But as we  talked 
earlier about the fami ne, and what complicity
 the British had.  The other day there was a 
fascinating program on the Vikings. 
 They were the kings of Kiev 
in Russia.  They went east.  
Nobody– I never heard that before. 
 

Q: What about Holocaust-era histor
y?   Have you done much reading a
bout that or taken an interest 
in finding out what happened on a broader scale? 
 

A: Oh yes, yes, definitely.  As you know there ar
e a lot of programs, bits and pieces.  There is a 
lot– new things, but also things that are being, 
I think, being hidden from 
view that never show 
again.  The– well of course, in addition to Spie
lberg™s mo vie, I™m not sure what the show was 
the other day, but there are a num
ber of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with 
certain aspects of the Holocaust .  Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily 

in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and thei
r henchmen and how they got involved and what 
they did.  And the Holocaust in th
e broadest sense, in terms of th
e enslaving of particularly the 
Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, geno
cide of them, not necessarily just the Jews.  

But then one thing, and I have a video of it, 
it was on PBS ma ybe twenty-five years ago, about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
32
 
 
 
32
Fort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again. 
 I mentioned to you earli
er the anti-Semitism of 
the State Departme nt.  In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in governme nt 
circles, but was being hidden from the Americ
an population, a number of Henry Morgenthau™s 
employees went to him and said, ﬁYou go to FDR and tell him he does some
thing or else we™re 
going to go public that the U.S. governme nt knows a
bout this and isn™t doing anything.ﬂ  And as 
a consequence of that, they brought some  six, 800, 
what was then called DPs, displaced persons, 
to this country.  They had to sign a statement,
 which of course anybody in his right mind would 
have, that after the war they would go back to th
eir country of origin.  
And they put them into 
Fort Ticonderoga.  And after the war was over wi
th, they tried to ship them back.  We ll, you 
know, you signed this thing.  But a number of coupl
es had had children here.  They we re born at 
Fort Ticonderoga and therefore th
ey were native-born citizens, a
nd therefore their parents were 
entitled to stay here as the pare
nt s of mi nor Amer ican citizens.  The State Department declar ed 
Fort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens.  Can 

you imagine a place that is so hist
orically important in the Amer
ican Revolution being declared 
not being a part of America?  I mean that™s 
the kind of convoluting, con
volutions, unfortunately, 
our governme nt went through.  As 
I said, that was a PBS show, 25 
years ago, I have never seen it 
again.  I guess too ma ny toes were being step
ped on.  But– and of course, I went to the 
Holocaust museum, but I couldn™t take it, make it 
past the Saint Louis, because I reme mber that 
one vividly.  Another blac
k ma rk in our history. 
 

Q: So, it was too painful to 
be going through and remi nded?  
 

A: Yeah, I me a n the thing is, painful and the thi
ng is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred 
passengers and I don™t think two dozen
 survived.  It™s incredible that the things that the U.S. 
governme nt could have done, should have done a
nd never did do.  It™s that kind of ma lfeasance 

that really upset me, particul arly in that context. 
 

Q: Related to that, I™m interested in something you 
said in your last intervie
w, which was a piece of 
advice that you were giving to 
other Holocaust survivors.  That ma ny have me t with very good 
fortune in their post-war lives and 
that they ought to do what they can to give some thing back to 
the community.  And so on the one hand you have th
at comp ulsion or that 
desire and on the other 
hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings 
of this governme nt and the ways that they 
have, have really not served th
e– and in particular in the co
uple of instances you just brought 
up, Holocaust survivors.  How 
do you reconcile those two? 
 

A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separa
te issues.  Maybe they are related, and that is by 
giving back to the community, by helping people th
at are in need of help. Maybe because the 
governme nt should and isn™t, that you™re overcom
ing the shortcomings of our governme nt.  Even 
though I don™t take that into consideration.  There are two ways that one can give back, one is 

financially and that™s the easy way out that most of
 us take, is to ma ke contributions to a variety 
of charitable organizations, or non-
profit organizations.  But then 
the more important one is to 
give of your time and help people.  I™m sure
 the same  thing holds true for Lexington, in 
Louisville there is a shortage, an incr edible shor
tage of volunteers.  And 
all of us retirees who 
have spare time , and we should have spare time , 
should donate some  of that time  to some  of 
these organizations.  Wh ether it™s Dare to Care 
to sort out cans of food, 
or  work at the Wayside 
Christian Mission as an example, any of these she
lters, and dish out food for people in need.  Or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012
  
 
33
 
 
 
33
I work in the tax program, in f
act I have somebody come in who 
needs help with their taxes.  
One of the great organizations in general of a vari
ety of needs is Catholic 
Charities.  And they™re 
desperate for volunteers.  Obviously: they asked me
 to help.  (Laughing.)  And I have.  But the 
thing is, that is one way that you 
can give back.  And whether it™s 
in your own expertise or if it™s 
just plain labor.  Some people ar e unwilling to 
become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or 

drive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger
 or whatever.  But that™s the kind of jobs that 
need to be done.  And that™s th
e kind of things that ma kes ma
ny of these non-profit organizations 
click.  Newt Gingrich, who is so ma ligned, some  f
our or five years ago, for his reasons felt that 
the public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. governme nt.  And I completely agree 

with him.  But that doesn™t mean that today th
ey give them big hunk of mo ney and tomorrow it™s 

zilch.  Cut it back.  I work for the public radio st
ations here as a volunteer.  And they used that 
withdrawal of  government funds
 to encourage the public to c
ontribute and they did tremendous, 
the biggest drive they ever had. 
 And rightly so.  I™m a fir m be
liever in putting the public back 
into public radio and public tele
vision, but it requires a commit me nt
 on the part of the people to 
ma ke financial donations.  And that™s just one, that™s not nearly as, I suppose, important as 

helping some body who™s hungry or reading for the 
blind, but it™s one of 
the large variety of 
volunteer jobs that needs to be 
done.  It™s amazing, I don™t do that much.  I™m not trying to pat 
myself on the back.  But one of the people that us
ed to work for me  profes sionally now actually 
works for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer
 activities, got the GE
 volunteer award of the 
year, he and his wife, jointly, this
 past year.  Between the two of 
them they put in three thousand 
hours a year, that™s a hell of a lot 
of hours.  That™s almost a fulltime job.  If we could get half the 
people to do half that or for that ma tter, ten pe rcent of the people to do ten percent of that, it 

would be a lot of help.  And 
that™s what I mean by that. 
 

Q: Have you traveled much within Kentucky?    

 
A: Not that much.  I mean we™ve been all over. 
 Been both west and east, and south.  Essentially 
covered the whole state more or
 less, but not extensively. 
 
Q: Does the culture or the histor
y of the state interest
 you particularly or are you more kind of 
limited–? 
 

A: Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at leas
t that more recently that the antagonism toward 
Louisville, Louisville versus th
e rest of Kentucky, seems to be dimi nishing.  But that is, you 
know the large city versus the rest of the state.  Look at New York and New York City, Georgia 

and Atlanta and you know, you can go on.  I think it™s pr
obably true of most st
ates that the large 
cities are thought to be repres
entative and they™re not.  Even 
though they contain most of the 
population.  And I can understand that
.  And the interests of Kent
ucky in particularly are so 
diverse, from Appalachia with its problems, 
and Western Kentucky with some  of the same  
problems and some totally different problems.  
And Louisville, of course , for painfully obvious 
reasons having totally different problems that peopl
e in Appalachia couldn™t care less about.  But 

that™s true everywhere.  And it™s amazing, the th
ing that I thought that the United States was 
unique, unfortunately, in its race re
lations problems.  They™re not.  
It™s the same  everywhere.  It 
doesn™t ma tter what country you go to, it ma y not be
 like we have, black a
nd white.  But we were 
in New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or 

whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved
 in it.  Well, the mere fact that they have a

34
Royal Commission on Race Relations says there™s 
a pr oblem there.  And it™s the Maoris, which 
are no longer in existence.  The purest Maori is
 one-eighth Maori and se
ven-eighths white.  And 
in Australia it™s the indigenous people versus the 
settlers.  And then of 
course among the settlers 
you get the same ethnic divisions that you get 
everywhere else .  Look right now, Fiji, the 
Solomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in
 ethnic and race problems.
  Africa is just a 
terrible situation. 
 

Q: Were you– was that some thing that you were part
icularly aware of in your early years in the 
U.S., segregation, the Civil Ri
ghts Moveme nt, any of those? 
 

A: No, not really.  I read about 
it and I heard about it 
and was only peripherally affected by it.  But 
in the early fi fties, while I was in Durham, 
the ma yor of Durham was Jewish.  Why I don™t 
know.  There™s a fairly good sized, there was 
aŠthere ma y still beŠa
 good-sized Jewish 
community in Durham because of the tobacco in
dustry.  Appa rently they brought the Jews down 
in order to ma ke cigars, like they did in Tampa 
with the Cubans.  And th
en, I still reme mber the 
man™s na me, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bi
shop for North Carolina. 
 The little town of 
Washington, North Carolina was two parishes, a 
black and a white.  Neither one of them could 
support a priest, and he ordered them integrate
d.  Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked.  
Wasn™t– no more than two months and they essen
tially had ninety percen
t attendance of the two 
parishes in one church building.  It was unhear
d of.  Of course the press would claim race 
relations are only bad in the Sout h.  Well, they™re probably a lot 
better in the South than they 
were elsewhere.  But yeah, I certainly was keen
ly aware of it, and cautious.  Before I bought a 
house in Houston, this was in the la
te fifties, I consulted with a lo
cal friend to say ﬁHey, so that I 
don™t stub my toe, is there anyplace that I cannot
 go?   Where I would be refused because I am 

Jewish? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁYes.  Don™t go to Oak Fo
rest,ﬂ or Forest Oaks, whatever it wa s called, 
which I couldn™t anyway, that wa
s the rich neighborhood.  But you le
arned to do those things.   
 

Q: Is there something else that
 I haven™t asked you about that yo
u™d like to talk about today? 
 

A: No, I can™t really think of 
much.  I don™t know whether this 
gets perpetuated or not, but I 
certainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors,
 but all retirees to th
ink about give some thing 
back to the community. 
 

Q: This is some thing that™s very important to you, 
it seems.  I mean, you bro
ught it up last time, too. 
 

A: Yeah, I think so.  There™s such a terrible n
eed.  And what ma kes me  particularly, actually 
angry– I have two or three acquaintances who areretired, who went back to work on a part-time 

basis, because they don™t know what to do with 
themselves.  They™re bored.  This is utterly 
ridiculous.  And I keep trying to get them enrolled 
in some  activity and they just won™t do it.  But 
there™s just too ma ny people that need help, w
ho cannot help themselves.  And throwing money 
at the problem is not necessarily
 the solution.  It isn™t that it 
can™t be done without mo ney, but 
it™s the personal help that™s require
d.  And here in Louisville, we
 are blessed with a number of 
things.  We  have here three gr
oups that ma ke recordings for the blind.  The Recordings for the 
Blind, the Audio Studio, and there™s 
a third one.  There isn™t another 
city in this country that does 
that.  We  have three public radio stations.  Ther
e is not, even New York 
only has one.  There are

35
a lot of things that are good th
ings, ma tter of fac t  I don™t brag 
about Louisville, keep down the 
population influx.  (Laughing.) Selfish. 
 
Q: So, you™re pretty much of
 a Louisville patriot, huh? 
 

A: We have it very good here in Kentucky, and part
icularly in Louisville, and of course, Lexington 
in ma ny wa ys, much more dynami c than Louisville 
is, for one thing they™v
e got the city-county 
governme nt, which we won™t get.  It™s up for 
voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it 
won™t happen.  The race relations ri
ght now are just so terrible.  All you ha ve to do is look at 
other communities and other cities and that™s not
 just– take this house here as an example, 
which you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let™s say 150 

to 250.  Go to Silicon Valley you coul dn™t touch it 
for two and a half million dollars.  In other 
areas, yeah you ma y be able to get for less, bu
t most areas you can™t 
touch it for twice the 
amount of money.  Matter of fact
, mo st retirees moving out of Ca
lifornia, sell their houses and 
live happily ever after, because
 they can buy another house some where else in Arizona or in 
Florida for a fraction of what it™s worth in Calif
ornia.  Our food prices 
are reasonable, with the 
exception of gasoline in Jefferson County.  I went 
to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a 
gallon less than what it is in Loui
sville.  I mean that™s ridiculous.  Could have gone as far as 
Simpsonville, that™s only ten miles, 25 cents a gall
on.  But outside of these temporary distortions, 
Louisville has grown up a lot in 
the last 15, 20 years.  I used to
 get all my bread from Chicago, 
now there™s a grocery store over on Ta
ylorsville Road that carries it 
and I can go get it there.  We 
used to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supp
ly of cold cuts, now I can buy almos t  all of it 
here.  And so on and so forth.  We ™re blessed he
re with, within two mile
s or three, excellent 
bakeries and different bakeries
.  If you want a certain thing 
you get it here.  How ma ny 
communities can you say that?   In 20
 mi nutes I™m at the airport. 
 
Q: You feel welcome here, co
mfortable here as a Jew? 
 
A: Oh yes, absolutely.  That is not an issue at 
all in this community.  I™ m sure there™s al ways, well 
like the Ku Klux Klan exists here, but you can i
gnore that.  No, I have never had anybody ma ke 
a disparaging remark to me or denied me someth
ing because I™m Jewish.  Absolutely.   Until the 
present ma yor, the Mayor of Louisville was Je
wish, Jerry Abramson, one of the mos t  popular 
ma yors that the city of Louisville
 has had.  I think he was in ther
e for thirteen years, the longest 
that anybody ever has.  And he was quite, I me a n
 it was not anything that
 was hidden.  He was 
quite open about it.  No, I don™t thin
k there™s a problem at all here. 
 

Q: Anything else you™d like to say? 

 

A: No, nothing in particular.  Keep the good works up. 

 

Q: Thank you very much. 

 

A: Thankyou.
