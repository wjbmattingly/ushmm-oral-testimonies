On Novem ber
 
9and 10, 1938, a violentanti
-
Jewish Pogrom  known as Kristallnacht
, 
or Night of  Broken Glass
,  
instigated prim arily by Nazi Part y off icialsand Nazi Storm T roopers, 
tookplace. ThePogrom  took place throughout Germ any, parts of Czechoslovakia, and Austria. 
In thisphotograph, Germ ans pass by thebroken shop window of  a Jewish

Concerned about the saf ety of  theirf am ily, the Rosenf elds registered their children 
for a kindertransport,the informal nam e of arescue effortthat brought thousands of ref ugee 

Jewish children toGreat Britainf rom  Nazi Germ any between1938and 1940. T he arrows show 

the routeof  the kindertransport.
 
 
Esther wore this tag attached to her clothing as she traveledf rom  her hom etown of  
Adelsheim ,Germany, to Thorpe, Norwich, England, to join herf oster family, the Harrisons.

: 
Esther, thank youf or joining us today andfor your wi llingness to be our
 
F i rs t  
Person
.W elcome to all of  yourf am ily andf riends thatare gatheredhere inthef ront row. And 

to all of you, thank you for being with us.
 
 
Esther, youhave a great deal to share ina short period so we'll get started right 
away if  that'sok.
 
 
You were ver y young when your parents sent you toEngland. Although you were 
too young to be able to tell usf irsthand aboutlif e in Germ anyf or your family at that tim e, 

perhaps you can
 
give us a sense of  what you've beenabletopiecetogetherabout yo
u r f am ily 
and about
 
Adelsheim.

>> Esther Starobin:
 
I'm happy to do that. Clearl y I don't remember any of this. About our 
f a m ily,  I  le a rn
ed
 
itf rom m y sisters, as m uch as they would talk about which wasn't a lot. And 
later as we get intof urther inf orm ation,there's am an who lives in Adelsheim who researched. 
Andheand I correspond by em ail. I've learned a lotf rom him
a
nd occasionally f rom other 
sources, which when Italk about som ething,
 
I'll tell about it,at the tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usa little about Adelsheim
. I
t was andI think still is a ver y sm all town.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
It i
s a very sm all town. T here's one stop light in it. I've been back there 
three tim es because Ifelt a greatneed to goback and see where Icam ef rom. But therewas a 

sm all Jewish community, about 10f am ilies.My f atherand mother lived there. Before that,m y 

father had lived in another little placeand once their oldest daughter was born, they m ovedto 

Ad
e ls he im .  
 
 
My f ather sold grain. He had been in the FirstW orldW ar and lost a leg in the First 
W orldW ar. Originally he hadtrained to be abaker, to work in a bakery. But you can't really do 

that when you have tostand and you have awooden leg. So he was selling grain. My m other 

worked with him because som etim eshehad trouble getting upanddown the cart. 
 
 
It's hardf orm eto think of that
. W
hen they we re doing this, it wasn't in cars, wasn't in
 
trucks. It was a cart, which is a lot different to do.So
 
he did that.
 
 
T here weref ive children, as you saw in thepicture, which explainswh y I have all of  
thisf am ily here. I was the youngest. And I was born,as he said, in1937, when things had 

already started tobecom e very diff icultf orm y parents.
 
In f act
, in1937, bef oreI was born, my 
father was being sued
 
--
 
a custom er was saying thathehad solda cow that was bad.W ell, it 
turns outm aybe the cow was bad,m aybe it wasn't but it was a way
 
--
 
m y f ather lost his 
business that way. And not only he did losehis business, he had to pay all the expenses.He 

didn't gethis cow back. So it was really a hard time. Sofor them to thenhave another baby, 

which was m e.
 
 
Butm y sister tells me bef ore all of thishappened life in Adelsheim  was apretty 
happy tim e. Th
ey hadever ything they needed.T hey spentholidays with relatives, doing the 

things doontheSabbath. And they originall y went to school,to theneighborhood school.But 

then they were not allowed to go tothe school because Jewish kidswere not allowed.
 
 
T hey f irst went tof am ily. That didn't last. Then they went to live with m y two aunts in 
Aachen.W hen they were living in Aachen, they went tothe Jewish school there. My second 

sister, Edith, toldm e that som etim es there would be people in thehouse at n
ight and they 

were gone thenext morning. So they thinkm y aunts were helping peopleescape f rom  

Germ any or get out.
 
My second sister,Edith, who also liked to eat alot, said they used to 
som etimes walk across the border and would come back with food,esp
ecially chocolates, and 

som e kindsof  clothingtucked into their clothes. They were going back andf orth acrossthe 

border.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One other question.W hat was theage rangeamong your siblings?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
My oldest sister is 12 years older than me. She'stheonly onethat's still 
alive. So I'm the youngest and she's theoldest.T hree in them iddle have died.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Kristallnacht, Night of BrokenGlass, occurred in Novem ber
 
1938. T hat had a 
prof oundeffect on your fam ily in, of  course, leading them  to conclude that life under the Nazis 

was already horrible and was going to becom e worse likely. T ell us what you canaboutwhat 

the im pact of Kristallnacht was on yourf am ily andanything that youm ight know about it.
 
>> Esther Starobin
: 
W ell, m y sisters were living, as I said, in Aachen with m y aunts.T heywent 
off  to school. Because they didn't really know what was happening.T hey saw the synagogue 

 
4
 
burning.T hey were told go hom e.
 
 
My sisters reall y didn'ttalk a lot about what happened bef ore they lef t.T hey left in 
March 1938 on the kindertransport.They leftf rom  Aachen.They didn't have a chanceto say 
goodbye tom y parents.
 
 
W ell, Iheard two things. Bertle saidher ears were 
p
ierced becausethere was an old 
wi ves tale it helped your eyesight. She didn't ever wear glasses, so m aybe.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
And m y sister, Edy, talked about on the train when they crossed theborder 
into thenext country
,  
that they were gi ven oranges andfood and she remembers that. Butm y 
s
isters really never talked m uch about the actual being on thetrain and going.
 
 
Now, in Adelsheim  I know what happened and I know all of  thisf rom Reinhart who 
has told us this.People cam ef rom the neighboring villa ge. T hey destroyed thetem ple.W hen 

you 
think of atem ple,you think of abig, beautif ul building.T his was anugly s quared small 
place. They took the Torahs out, the Bibles
. T
hey took everything out and took it toa sports 
f ield and burned it.Som em en were dragged outof  their houses and taken
 
away. M y parents' 
house was sort of off the MainStreet sonothing actually happenedto them. According to 

Reinhart, you know, he's researching, andI don't know that these were all people com ingfrom  

another village and they would addone or two people in each village.W ho knows? 
 
 
T hat's basically what I know.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Onthat night, over 300 synagogues were burned throughout Germ any and 
Austria, thousands of businesses destroyed.And in your comm unity, because it was a small 

comm unity, ver y f ew J
e wis h  f am ilie s ,  I t
hinkm aybe 10,and your fam ily had been theref or 
centurie
s . 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Not in thatarea.They had been in that areafor200 years.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They were severely affected by Kristallnacht. Asa result of that, your parents
, 
thefollowing year, early 1939, m ade truly an extraordinary decisionto send their daughters 

away on a kindertransport. T ellus,f irst, what the kindertransport was and then what you know 

about, if anything, about how arrangem entswere m adetodo that.
 
>
> Esther Starobin:
 
People in England went to the governm ent, theJewish people in England 
went to the governm ent, and asked if they could bring children over. And the parliam ent 
in  

England
 
said they could bring childrenas long as they weren't going to bea ward of  the 
country. They had to have a guaranteed am ountof m oney andhomes had to befoundf or 

them . Other groups joined in helping the Jewish groups,particularly the society of f riends, the 

Quakers.And thenthey sent peopleto Germany to help organi
ze  i t .
 
 
I don't really know and there'snota real way to know whether m y aunts arranged
 
--
 
m y sist e rs lef t f rom  Aach e n
 
--
 
whetherm y aunts really arranged it,m y parents. It isn't clear to 
m ef rom  whatI know. But m y sisters lef ts inMarch 1938 and wentto England.
 
W e had an aunt 
in England, oneof m y m other's sisters, whoworked as a domestic in England because you 

couldn't do muchelsewhen you were a refugee kind of person. And shefoundplacesform y 

sisters throughthepeople she hadm et and knew. 
 

 M
y oldest sister, Bertle, went to live with some peoplef rom Scotland and actually 
went to Scotlandf ora while. And then whenshe was 16
 
--
 
because she was 14 when she 
went.W hen she was 16, she moved back to live with m y auntand go to work.
 
At some later
 
date there was a knock on thedoor and there were policementhere and said, " Do you know 

this man?"  She said, 
ﬁ
I don't know that name.
ﬂ 
It turnedoutthe people shehad been livi
n g 
with, the man was actually a Germ an spy. And while they hadbeen in Scotland, he hadbeen 

 
5
 
taking inf ormation about the planes and things that were happening there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soa brilliant cover, taking a Jewish child, ref ugeef rom  Germany, and spy for 
the Nazis.
 
 
A couple of other questions bef ore we talk about your getting to England if  we 
c a n.  
Your sisters went in March. You would go inJune, I believe.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know wh y you didn't go atthe sam e tim e asyour sisters? And youalso 
had your brother, Herm an, at home as well.
 
>> E s t h
er Starobin:
 
I don't know that. Do you want m e tof inish talking about what happened to 
m y sist e rs?  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Once they got there? No. W e'll com ebackto that.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Ok. I imagine perhaps itwas easier livin g
 
--
 
Aachen isa pretty big 
city 
com pared toAdelsheim . Maybe it was easier to getpeople.It's all speculation.I don't really 
know. I clearly wasn't there with them .
 
 
As to why they didn't send m y brother, Idon't know butaccording to m y sister, 
Bertle, he was spoiled rotten becau
se he was theboy.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
So I don't know. Did the kindertransportnottake boys as easily? I was 2, 
so he was 6. Idon't really know that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ultim ately I think about 10,000 children were saved as a result of the 
ki
ndertransport. Does that sound right to you?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So your sisters going, went f irst. You startedto tell us where they each went. 
You were not there yet.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Right. SoEdith, m y next in line sister, lived
 
with af am ily in England.And 
then when the war really started, children were sent out of the big cities so she was sentto 

anotherfam ily. She always said she was treated like a slave there. Shedidnot goto school. 

Af ter she was 14 shewasn't allowed to go to school. Eventually she joined the wom en'sArm y 

in England.
 
 
Ruth lived with a doctor in thefam ily in London. And then she lived with another 
fam ily outof  London and eventually landed up in a hostile. Never quite sure whathappened. 

Once she toldm e it was because she wouldn't doher Hebrew lessons. But Idon't think that's 

re a lly wh y
 
--
 
you know, how.
 
T here was a lotof m ovem ent in kids inEnglandduring the war. A 
lot of things happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Justas anaside, m y mother's English. She
 
was evacuated during the war to 
the countryside andmoved to several different places, in that experience.And she remembers 

a place where she went where her words are," I was essentially their scullery m aid" as a 

13
-
year
-
old in the country.
 
 
Your aunt, Aunt Hannah, tellus about her. 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
My Aunt Hannah. She was a very energetic, opinionated lady. Very good. 
W ell, we haven't talked about where I wentbut shealso kept kosher. That will com e later. But 

she really looked after us. She knew where ever ybody was. She kept track. She sent 

informationtom y parents. Idon't know why s he was sm art enough to leave early. I have no 

idea.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You don't know any of  that.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
The thing is,m y sister, Bertle, who is 12 years older thanm e, she always 

 
6
 
says that kidsat that tim e didn't know everyth ing that was happening in thefam ily.W ell,my 
sister is nota stupid wom an. How she couldn't have known som eof this stuff is beyondm ebut 

she says she didn't. So I guess shedidn't.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W henyou f inally got there inJune, your brother stayed behind thatm eant four 
sisters were there and in diff erentplaces.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know if  there was any attem pt in trying to have you stay together 
in one 
home or was that justnot possible? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
I don't think that was possible.T here was an organization in England 
called Bloom sbury House that kept track of us and sort of lookedaf ter us. Not too 

energetically. And I just got recordsf rom them .T here's extensive records about Bertle, what 

she was doing, any m oney that was given to people.T here's a little bit aboutme. And it talks 

about Ithink whenI was getting ready to leave, they hadtakenm efor a picture. A tiny bit 

about Ruth, m
y sister Ruth. Hardly anything
 
--
 
well, they didn'tf indanything about Edith.They 
didn'thave enough inform ation.I have to send inf orm ation back.
 
But it was really interesting 
because the information on Bertle was m uchm oreextensive than on us.But the
y k e p t  t r a ck  o f  

thepeople,the kids that were there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you'll tell us ina mom entwhere you went. It was with a Christianf amily.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did som eof  your siblings go to other Christianf am ilies or to J
ewish hom es or 
did itm atter, just whoever would take you in?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Ruth originally went
 
--
 
the doctor'sf am ily was Jewish. And the people that 
Edith went to were Jewish. And the one thattreated her like a slave were Jewish, too. I think 

th e
 
people that Ruth land up with in between the hostile were not Jewish. And Bertle's people 
were not Jewish.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So it was am atter of
 
--
 
it sounds like wherever a hom e couldbefound.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Right. And a lot of kids from the kindertransport landed up in group hostile 
kind of things.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwas a hostile?W ethink of  a hostile now where college students stay on 
the cheap.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Like an orphanage kind of place.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At least one of your sisters e
nded up in a hostile.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So June
 
1939 you go.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
I go . 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of  course, you're too young to know anything about your trip therethat you 
know f irsthandbut tell us what you know about your
 
leaving, arriving, and where you went.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
The one thing I don't know is who took care of m e. I was on this trainand 
then on aboat. Ihaveno idea who took careof m e.ButI landed upin London.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you're 2 years old.
 
>>
 
Esther Starobin:
 
2 years old. And som ebody f rom  the Quaker society took me by trainto 
Norwich. There's a good train service. And then Ihave a copy of a letter that the wom an in 

Norwich was also partof  thef riends,had writt en to m yf oster mother asking
 
did they want m e 
brought out to where they lived or could they com e tothe station.And I don't really know what 

they did.
 
 
So I landed with the Harrisons.T hey lived out
s id e  No rwic h
, a cathedral city. So I 

 
7
 
was taken there. The Harrisons, m y f oster father
, Uncle Harry, work edfor a shoefactory that 
was owned by a Jewis h man.And there was a sign onthe bulletin board is anybody wi lling to 
takeone of these children. And they were will ing to take me.They had one son Allen, seven 

years older than Iam . I think they basically wo uld have liked anotherboy but they got me 

instead.
 
Originall y I was supposed to go to 
W
ales. I don't know wh y that f ellthrough.So I arrived in 
Norwich. I prom ptly got pneumatic
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Scarlet 
F
ever?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Scarlet 
F
ever. I was in isolation. Allen used to play with m e through the 
wi n d o w.
 
 
I was basically af raid of loud noises. I was af raid of Uncle Harry who  was the 
kindest, m ildestm an you ever heard.ButI was af raid. Andall I could think of  was that I mus
t 
have heard a lot of men yelling and shouting in Adelsheim  because I was af raid of himf or a 

long tim e.
 
 
But I lived with this family. T hey belonged toa ver y f undam entalist Christian chapel. 
T hem an who owned it and ran it, a Mr.
 
Ram sey, helped them out 
a bit. Back then 2
-
year
-
olds 
were still bab
ie
s. Not like now. And I think they ga ve him  som eof  the things they needed. I 
think occasionally they helped him  with money.
 
 
T his chapel was a small chapel. And many of thepeople who lived there belongedto 
it .
 
It 
had 
a lot of  community activities of which I was a very happy participant.But now in 
churchesand synagogues, thebig thing is com munity. And it really was a community place 

th e n. 
 
 
So I lived with the Harrisons. I was very happy there. I went to school. I did whatever 
kids did,did naughty things, good things. I guess I basically knew I wasn't thereforever but I 

didn'task questions. Itwasn't oneof  the things I did.
 
Allen was really good to me.A lotof big 
brothersdom eanthings to their little sisters.He never did. He would take me with him and 

drag m earoundand all of that.
 
 
Bertle andEdith and Ruthused to come to visit sometimes in Norwich. It was hard 
originall y f or them  to travel because there were a lotof  regulations,especially for peo
ple f rom  

Germ any.
 
Onetim e Bertle came,and she was livin g with m y Aunt Hannah at the tim e, and my 
Aunt Hannah was kosher and it was hard toget m eat and chicken.So Idon't know how, the 

Harrisons got hera chicken. Shetook this live chickenbackon the train because it hadtobe 

killed kosher in London. But they cam e.
 
 
One tim e we all went to London to visit AuntHannah andBertle.There was a lotof  
tension betweenm y f oster Monday, Auntie Dot andm y Aunt Hannah. Idon't really know what 

that was about.
 
Maybe it was just a natural kind of thing.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Speculating. Fam ily took you in thisand were raising you as part of their 
household during the tim e. I'm sure Bertle was trying to check on you
 
--
 
or Hannah, Im ean, 
tryin g to make sure to keepthef am ily ties strong and all of that.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W ell, yes. So we went
 
--
 
I we n t to  
a Seder which I hadno idea
 
what it was. 
I had absolutely no idea. I was supposed to be learning Hebrew. Mr.
 
Ram sey, the m an f rom  
the chapel, knew Hebrew but I am
 
really badat languages. I didn't really learn it.
 
 
One tim e som ebody cam e from  Bloom sbury Housef rom the school to chec

I do remember the headm aster not leaving m e alone with him. Idon't remember what they 

askedm e or what they really checkedon
. 

 
So I was there

The Harrisons didn't try to convert you or raise youas a Christian or do you 
know? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
They belonged to something called the Hebrew Christian Society. So they 
probably would have not been unhappy if  I had converted
. B
ut I was10 years old
; 
what did I 
know? I knew nothing about Judaism .W hat Iknew
 
--
 
I m ean, I know tonsof hym ns andall of  
those things. But I don't
 
--
 
they wouldn't havedone that.They weren't that kind of people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
B ef o r e
 
we continueon with what it was likefor you living with the Harrisons 
both during the war and a little while after thewar, your parents, of course, when you lef t, were 
still in Adelsheim and your brother, Herm an,was with them.T ell uswhat you can abou
t wh a t 
happened to Herm an and then what happened to your parents asbest you know.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
InOctober of 1940, the Jews of  the state Adelsheim  was in were rounded 
up.T hey were told they could bring a small suitcase. They had to go toa central
 
place.
 
My brother apparently hadbeen at school som eplaceelse and washomefor one of the Jewish 

holidays that day. So he was in the houseand rounded up with them . Andthey were taken to 

Gurs in France.T hey were in Gurs, which was a work camp in France. Andm y brother was 

with them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And he's probably, what, 7 atthattim e? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Yeah.7 I guess.
 
 
Som y f ather's wooden leg for som e reason didn't go with him. Ihave copies of 
le tte rs tha t ca me
 
--
 
Reinhart found them
 
--
 
t hat  
show them ayor of Adelsheim sayi
n g t
his m an 
hada wooden leg
; w
here is it
. And they did f
ind his wooden leg so his leg was sent to him  in 
the camp of m y parents both worked in the kitchen in the cam p.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hichwas in France.
 
>> Esther Starobin
: 
Itwas in France. One of my aunts was in the cam palso.And thef act that 
they were in the kitchen, they could geta little extra foodf or Herman.
 
 
So in1980s, whenthere started to be a lot of inf ormation onT V about the 
Holocaust, m y sister, Bertle, said, oh, I've got lettersf rom m other when she was in the camp. 

W ell, Ididn't know that. My husband had them  translated. Basically that's the only way I k now 

anything m uch aboutm y m other. My father just wrote a couple of  lines underneath. He didn't 

reall
y wr ite on itbut m y m other 
did. 
T here aref ive letters. Bertle saidshe hadother letters but 
they got lost inthe movem ent.
 
 
So at the beginning, my mother was very hopef ul thatthey were going to be able to 
leave and get out. But you neededmoney todo thatand the right connections so that wasn't 

going to happen.
 
A coupleof  things I learned f rom them . I never realized that you needed 
m oney in the cam ps.If you had money, you couldbuy some things. Som y sister
,  
B e rt l e
,  wa s  
s
ending them  money.
 
>> B ill B
enson:
 
From  England?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
From  England. A
nd Ithink a coupleof m y uncles f rom herehad sent 
m oney. Butm y m other would wr ite
 
--
 
just likea mother
 
--
 
to Bertle, who was not living with us, 
was in her teens,m ake sure your siblings behave
, t
hey thankthe people taking care of them , 

wash behind their ears
,  
do well in school
;  
you know, all the things anybody's m other would tell 
you to do on how tobehave. Im ean, they wer e in this horrible situation with not enoughfood, 

nof reedom , and they'r e
 
still trying to m ake sure that us children were being raised properly, 
behaving in a wa y that we should. It was pretty am azing to m e. 
 
 
So in the letters
 
--
 
a lot of  the letters are asking them to contact this relative andthat 
relative, aside f rom  tellin
g them  how to behave. In one 
letter m y 
m other says " Save your 

 
9
 
clothesform e.I am  so thinnow I could get into your clothes." W ell,m y mother was nota thin 
lady. You could seethat f rom  thepictures.So Ifound thatpretty am azing that they did that.
 
 
Bu
t somewhere in oneof  the letters itm entions that Herman is in som e kind of
 
--
 
is  
not with them , is in som e kind of a school ora hom e that children in France were in.W ell,we 

didn't know m uch about that. 
 
 A
nd this is another exam ple of how we're still f inding out a lot of things. T here's so 
m any things we don't know about ourfam ily. But there's someone who workedf orthis 

m useum  that I know who ism arried to som ebody f rom  Vienna andhadm eta young wom an in 

Vienna who was doing researchonthe kindertransport. She askedm e ifLilly could interview 

m eand Lilly intervie we d me.
 
So,at the sametim e,the Holocaust Museum is having a new 
exhibit next year about the American response tothe Holocaust and they f ounda picture of m y 

brother waiting to get on a
 
boat, because he did eventually come here. And theperson that 
Lilly was doing research was also waiting to get on thatboat. Sof rom  that connection we 

found out which homem y brotherhad been in. Im ean, it's such
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This isver y recent.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Oh, in the last year. So Lilly is doing research because she's going to write 
a book. Andevery tim e shedoes research, shef inds out other things about my brother, which 

is so interesting. My brother'sbeen dead 27 years, 25 years. He
 
would never talk about what 
happened to him .Andnow we're f inding out thesethings. 
 
 
On the ship manifest when it says about him  com ing to this country, or something 
about him , it says thathe knew
 
--
 
he could read French andGerman.W ell, where didhe 
learn 
to read it?I guesshe learned in these schools. How did he know these things? He certainly
 
--
 
he absolutely wouldn't talk about it
;  
so I don'tknow.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He cam ehere in 1941, I believe. Is that right?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
He d id . T he  Un it
ed States allowed 1,000 children in, in1941, it's called 
1,000 children. Andhe was one of the children that cam e then.They landed in New York. 

T here was a picture in thenewspaper.A second cousin saw this picture and somehow or other 

got Herm an connected with m y uncle here. He was raised by anaunt andunclehere. Heknew 

he had sisters but hewas a little kid. Hethought they were in this country and we were in 

England.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'm assum ing thatonce he camehere
 
--
 
was there any com munication 
f ro m  
Bertle oranybody with Herm an here in the United States during thatperiod? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
My m other knew he was here. Oneof  the letters talked about him being 
here andhow happy he was. He had this cousin who was like a big brother. So there w
a s 
comm unication. Ihave copiesof a coupleof  letters betweenm y m other andmy fosterm other. 

Luckily m y f oster mother saved things. Otherwise I wouldn't have that information.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatdo you know about your parents? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W e ll
, I know they were in  the camp.They were i n Gurs until 1942. Andin 
August of 1942they were sent to Auschwit z andthey were m urdered as soon as they got to 

A u sch wit z.  

>> Bill Benson:
 
And you now know exactly wh at convoy train they we nt on?
 
>> Esther Star
obin:
 
I do.T here's abook that was publishedby a Frenchperson. It listedall the 
convoys, the dates, the people who were onthe convoys, when their birthdays were, wher e 

they were f rom , and what happenedto them when they got there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did  
you have
 
--
 
to your knowl edge, did Bertle have lettersf rom  yourm om up 
until alm ostthe time?
 

 
10
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
She did. Unf ortunately the letters don't really have dateson them .W eput 
them  in some kind of order but reading over them recently, I'm  not
 
sure we have them  in the 
right order. But asI said, at the beginning m y m other really expected to getout. She really kept 
her religion. She still praised God, believed inGod.And I've gone through periods when I 

couldn't understandthat at all.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:
 
W hen your parents perished and they were murdered in Auschwitz, obviously 
all comm unication stopped. Do you know if  Bertle
 
--
 
how Bertle orother sisters
 
--
 
what they 
thought thatm eant,to no longer hearf rom  your parents?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W el
l, Bertle got a letter back so she knew what it m eant. I really didn't 
know. Even when I cam e hereI kept thinking, well, m aybe they'll appear. It was a while before 

it really sunk intom y headthat, no, they arenot going to. But Bertle knew andI guess E
dith 
and Ruth knew, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The Harrisons, you described it asa pretty happy tim e. You would end up 
spending eight of  your first 10 years living wit h the Harrisons. You were, of course
 
--
 
the war 
began. You went toEngland in June
 
1939. W ar b
rokeout in September
 
1939. And thenthere 
was terrible war going on inEngland, between the bombings and all of  that.Whatdo 
you 

recall, what im pact did the war have on you? I know you're out inthe countryside, not in 

London. Do you rem em ber what it meant in term s of hardshipsfor thefam ily or anything?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W ell, it's interesting. I had som ef riends who were English and they talked 
about always being hungr y. W e weren't hungry.W ehad a garden.So they grew som e 

vegetables. For a while we
 
had chickens. And then I think the ratsappearedand the chickens 
disappeared. And we gotf oodat school.W e used to getm ilk and stuff at school. In England 

they gi ve you lunch in schoolandI think they even did then.
 
 
W ehad to carry a gas m ask.W henmy younger daughter was in nursery sch
ool, 
som ebody brought a gas mask to the dress
-
up corner. I hada fit and I was in charge of  the 
dress
-
up corner so it lef t. I don't think gas masks are to be played with.W ehad a bom b 
shelter. I don'texactly rem em ber going into itbut Al
l
en, m y foster brother, tells m e we did. 
 
 
It didn't seem to im pact me a lot. I never remem ber hearing the radio.T here must 
have been one. I don't remem ber hearing it or seeing the newspapers. There was an Am erican 

Arm y basenearby. Allen tells m e they used to go. And when theGerm anplanes cam e over, 

they would collect the scraps thatfell down.But I didn't know he was doing that. He didn't tell 

m e that. 
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
W arends in May
 
1945. 
You would continue living wit h the Harriso
n s  un t il 
1947.T ell us what you can about thedecision, on Bertle's part, I guess, to get you the United 

S ta te s.
 

>> Esther Starobin:
 
My m otherhad always tol d Bertle she had to keep thefam ily together.And 
she did a superb job of that.
 
Bloom sbury House f o
und uspassage to com e to Am erica.T he 
Harrisons didn't have a phone. Soone day Bertle and I gotpassage.My sister Ruth came 

bef ore we did. Edith was in the Arm y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The British Arm y.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
The British Arm y. So Bertle calledthepolice in a Norwich
, 
had them com e 
around to the Harrisons and tell them  they had totake me to London thenext day to leave.
 
W e ll ,  it wa s
 
--
 
I knew Ihadto leave but I didn't know I was leaving ri ght then. But just recently I 
got some recordsf rom Bloom sbury House which says that they had taken me to get a 

p a ssp
o rt
 
--
 
it wasn't apassport, a travel something.T hey had taken m e to get a picture. So 
what did I think thepicture was for? You know? I wasn't thinking.
 

 
11
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That meansthe Harrisons
 
anticipated you were leavi ng.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
So we went up toLondon thenext day. Uncle Harry couldn't com e 
because he couldn't take off work. Allen was supposedto receive som e big prize thatday 
which, of course, he didn't.They tookm e toLondon andthey handed me over tom y sister.
 
Allen tellsm ehism other's hair turned white overnight. You know, she was so upset.She had 

written tom y uncle and asked if  I could stayandm y uncleshad writ tena sortof  nice note 

saying no, I couldn't.
 
>>
 
[Laught
e r]  
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Itwas interesting. Again, it was som ething I didn't know any of  this. My 
Auntie Dot gave me all of these letters when I was an adult. I didn't know that.
 
 
So we were traveling o n the Queen Mary.W ell, it wasn't exactly a luxur y liner in 
those days. Ithad been converted toa tro
op
 
ship and it was on itswa y back. Sothere was a 
strike theday we lef t because som ebody im portant was on the shipand it was decided it was a 

good day to have a strike. Bertle hada boyf riend who was a butcher. He had given her 

sausage,thank goodness, andm y aunt hadgi ven us bread so we were ok. Then we sailed. I 

wa s t e rrib l y se a sick.
 
 
W hat Ididn't know until m uch later, Bertle didn't want to goeither. Inever knew that. 
But she always does what she's supposed to.
 
 
W ecame to this country. W ell,two unclesm et us in New York, an uncle that used to 
live with us in Adelsheim , Uncle Solly, where m y brother lived, andan Uncle Jim  who married 

to auntof m ine. I,of  course, didn't know who they were. Bertle did. And we came down here 

and lived with m y Uncle Sigm und on a big house on North Capit
o
l Street
,  
if you'ref rom around 
here.
 
 
T here's amovie about the kindertransport called "Into the 
A
rm s  o f  
Strangers."  Many 
people in that talk about how awf ul it was goi ng to live with these people in England, how 

m ean they were and what a terribleexperience.W ell, that wasn'tm y experience. Com ing to 

live with m y aunt anduncle's was thatexperiencefor me.
 
 
My uncle hada pretty badtem per. My aunt was mentally ill. And back then they 
didn'thave all of these medicationsf or that. So they argued. My uncle threw furniture. It was 

nota good time. And it was m any diff erent things for me. I was living in a big city. I was li ving 

with tons of people.I was living with people who yelled and screamed.T hey were Jewish. I 

didn't know anything about Jewish. I went toa school where the teacher, f rankly, was nasty to 

m e. I was a teacher all m y lif e. I would never have done what she did. So it was a really, really 

bad experience
. 

 
My other uncle sometim es would give m y auntf oodbut she would keep it until it was 
bad. I threw m y lunchout on the way to school every day. Plus I have a lazy eye and nothing 

hadbeen done about it in England. I was 10 years old when I cam ehere.They
 
thought I was 
going to wear a patchonm y eye? I was weir d enough already.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
So I used to take thepatch off. Little did I know the nurse at the school 
knew I was supposed to be wearing it.
 
 
So I wentto an elementary school notf arf rom here, North Capit
o
l Stre e t.I ha d  
never been to am ovie. The Harrisonsdidn'
t g o  t o
 
m ovies, didn'tdance, didn't wear makeup. 
As an adult
,  
I know som eof  that was because they didn't have them oney. ButI didn't know 
that. My uncle dragged me kicking and scream ing to am ovie eventually. Clearly m y uncles 

drank
 
--
 
Im ean they didn't drink to excess but they diddrink. Ididn'tknow that then.
 

 
12
 
 
So all inall living with m y auntand uncle was nota greatexperience.W hen my 
sister, Edy came over,andonce she had a job,m y two sisters got an apartment. My sister 
Ruth was going to college by then. She wentto the University of  Maryland. Andbelieve it or 

not,backthen you could work and earn your room and boardand tuition, which is what she 

did.
 
Not anym ore. Butm y sisters got anapartm ent. So here were these young wom en, early 
20s, trying to makea living in a new country and they tookm e.T hey didn'thave to.T hey could 

have lef tm e withm y uncle, but they did.
 
So som etimes they were dating people that were 
teachers inm y school.It was ver y strange.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
But m y sisters were really ver y good tom e. They went outof  their way. 
And,of  course, I was ahead in schoolbecause the English schoolswere ahead in those days.
 
Never occurred tom e I couldn't go to college.My sisters never said you've got to go to work, 

which was probably good because If ailed typing.
 
I went to college. I lived
 
--
 
m y sister Ruth 
was m arried by then. I lived with Ruth and David.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hilegoing to college?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W hile I was going to college. So it all worked you out.Then I came back 
here andtaught school for a long time.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hen did 
you 
connect with your brother? At what point after you arrived?W as 
it  im m
ediate?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Oh, yes. Now, Bertle, remem bered him. I guessEdithand Ruth
.  
I didn't 
know who he was.
 
I was living with m y aunt anduncle. He was in high school when I wasin 
high school.W edid som ethings together. But we weren't li ving tog
e ther.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You've gone back to Germ any and toAdelsheim.W hat was that likefor you? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
First tim e I went back it was because Ineeded to know where I cam efrom . 
I needed to know I wasn't born ina blackhole. I neededto goback.Originall y Bertle and her 

husband Morris were going to go with m e butMorris had aheart attack. So Bertle wrote a 

letter to the people there telling them  thatI was com ing. And Fredand I landedthere. It was 

around noon. Nobody was around.It was so
 
creepy. There was absolutely nobody on the 
street,nothing happening. It turns out they all go homefor lunch or whatever they do.
 
 
So when wef inally got to theT own Hall, Idon't speak any Germ an and there wasn't 
anybody there who really spoke English. Sothey arrangedf orthe next day, thedeputy m ayor's 

wif e spoke English soshe was going to go wi th usand we were goi ng to go on atourof  the 

area.Then they said,well, you don't want tostay here tonight. Youknow, you can go to the 

next place. I said, no, I do want to stay here tonight. Idon't want tobe sent away again. So we 

stayed in a guest house there.
 
I don't know if thepeople knew who I was or not but Ihad such 
nightm aresthat night.I dream t the Nazis wer e com ing upthe stairsto get me. It
 
was really 
sca ry.  

 
But thenext day we went ona tour.T here was an olderm an who had actually 
known m y parents. And this wom an who translated. So we saw thehouse where m y f am ily 

had lived.W edidn't go in but we did see it.Andm y sisters had toldm e ce
rtain places. T here 

was a brook
 
--
 
back then when you baked the breadfor Shabbats,you took itto the comm unity 
bakery. Onetime Edith dropped it in the lake.So Ihad to lookat that. And I saw where the 

synagogue was. And there's a Jewish cemetery between that little town and thenext little 

town.W e wentthere.W esaw where m any of m y relatives were buried. So we saw a lot.
 
T here was a littlem useum. And there was atiny section inthis tiny m useum  about the Jews. 

T hem useum atthat tim e was only opened
 
Sunday afternoonsbut they opened it so we could 

 
13
 
go in.
 
 
I in no way f elt like this is m y hom e.If elt likea tourist touring.T hat's how If elt.But I 
was glad that I went.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And there were a couple of  peoplef rom  the town who eventually told you,if  I 
rem em ber right, tried to providef ood.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
That was later, when I went with Bertleand Renee. Bertleand Morris did 
go at som e point. T hey
 
m et thism an, Reinhart Lochman there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ho has become sort of  a historian
 
about what happened with the Jewish 
comm unity.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Right. Sohe wrote in2000 thatthey were having a com memoration of the 
deportation of the Jews. They were having a ceremony. And BertleandI both said they need 
som e Jews there. My niece, Renee, came wi th us.W e went to this thing which was interesting.
 
 
In the m eantim e
 
--
 
I'm sorry, I'm  disjointed inhow I talk. Bertle at som epoint asked 
m eto see if  there was any
 
--
 
what was happening in Rexingen, the town m y m other cam e 
f rom .  This  ma n
 
answered thathe wasf rom  Rexingen but he was inW ashington.And Bert
le  
wanted to meethim . Isaid, ﬁYou can't gom eet a strangem an by yourself.
ﬂ 
So Morris went with 
her. And we becamef riends with thism an,T im .
 
 
So when we went in 2000, we f irst went to Rexingen and stayed withT im
 
--
 
T im  
off ered hisparents' house. So we stayed there. And we got to see som e
 
places where m y 
m other wasf rom and the Jewish cem etery there.
 
T here's am an who has written a history of  
the cemetery there with the names of all thepeople, so I can look up som eofm y fam ily and 

thenext projectthisman did, there's a cem etery of  them an
 
--
 
of the people who were on the 
crusade.W hata difference in this world.
 
 
So when we got toAdelsheim that tim e, there were two people: one person who said 
his parents had brought f ood
 
--
 
hisfather brought food over tom y m other andfather at night 
andthat hism other was ver y concerned because if  shehad been caught, something m ight 

have happened to his fam ily
; a
ndthen another wom an who said they had traded things with 
m y parentsf orfood. So there were people.So it was an interesting tim e.
 
 
W egotto go into thehouse where we had lived. Reinhartarrangedfor us to go in. It 
had been renovated in the m eantim e.W h
at was really interesting to 
m e . O
n the top f loor, they 
hada littleboy about the sam e age as m y grandson was atthetime. Hehad all the sam e toys 

buthis were neat.T hey were stacked,put away. T hey were notamess. It was just interesting 

to  see  tha t.
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
You mentioned
, of co u rse, tha t your siste r, Ed ith ,I 
think, had been in the 
British Arm y. Did she end up stationed in Germ any? She went to Adelsheim early, right?
 

>> Esther Starobin:
 
She went when she was stationedthere. Somebody was walking along the 
street and said to her [Indiscernible]. She looked just like him  actually. But she got birth 

certif icatesand things like that.
 
 
Ruth has been, Bertle.We'veall been.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Inthe rem aining tim e
 
--
 
we want
 
--
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Oh, Herm an hasn'tbeen,didn't g
o.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A nd
 
as
 
you said, Herm an never talked about it.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
No. In  fa ct, 
t h e f
irst time Iwent and sent a postcard back his wif e saidhe 
wouldn't even look atthe postcard.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e'regoing to turn to the audience and see if  youhave some questions in a 
m om ent. But you've rem ained very close to the Harrisonfam ily. Say just a little bitaboutthat.
 

 
14
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W ell, as I said,m y sisters were ver y good people.T hey made me writ e 
letters. So we had visited with our kids. Our kids have been back. In1964, Allen cam eover as 
an exchangeteacher.W ebroughthis parents over to visit with us,which was really a ver y 

specialfor them and very special for us.
 
 
I  wa s  ju s t  in
 
--
 
m y foster parents have both died by now but 
I ju s t  vis it e d  A llen .  He ' s  
getting old. I'm  getting old, too,but he's getting older.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
W e have so muchhistory together, som any things. Allen usedto visit 
regularl y. Andaf term y fosterm otherdied, Uncle Harry used to come and spend six weeks 

with us.
 
 
W hat's really interesting, he loved to go to synagogue with m y husband. And at 
som e point after he died, Allenf ound out thatUncle Harry's f ather had been Jewish when he 

never knew, Uncle Harry never kne w that.If  he did, he never told us. So it was interesting.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did any of  your sisters stay in touch with any of  thefam ilies they had lived 
wi t h ?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
I think Ruth was in touch a littlebit with the 
f
i rs t  
f
am ily she was with. And

[Laughter] 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
No. You ask itas a serious question.W henAllen used to visit
 
--
 
I taught in 
them iddle school thathada very m ixed population.And I would take Allen to schoolan
d we 
would talk aboutthat I lived with him as afosterf am ily. But Im ean,I did m entionthe Holocaust 

but not so m uch.
 
 
I was invol ved with a group,a temple,bef orethe Holocaust Museum opened, that 
we did stuff oneducating our congregation. But I started volunteering here after I retired, which 

was quite a long time ago, actually. 
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkwe can turn to our audience, see if  you have som e questions.W ehave 
m icrophones on both sides of the aisle.W eask that if  you have a question, wait
 
until you have 
a m icrophone.T ry tom ake your questionas brief  as you can.T hen I'll repeat it just tobe sure 

we hear it correctly before Esther responds.
 
 
Anybody want to startus off with a question?If not, I will continue asking a bunch of 
questions
. 
 
 
W e have a brave soul right here.

Hello. I really enjoyed your speech. Thank you ver y m uch. You mentionedthe 
comm em oration you wentback to visit in your hom etown, thehistorian studying.W hatf orm  of 

comm em orationand what year did that takeplace?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The com memoration that took place in Adelsheim , when was it and what kind 
of  comm em oration didthey do?
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
Itwas October of 2000. It was in what usedtobe a synagogue inthe 
neighboring town. It's been made into a comm unity place. And Reinharthad made exhibits of  

a ll t h e  f am ilie s ,  a ll f ive  of the m,  of  f ive  f am il
ie
s. A lot of peoplehad contactedhim  tof ind out 
information. So we're used to very f ancy exhibits. These were various copiesof  things, letters 

 
15
 
and pictures, v
ery basi c kinds of things. There was a bandthat played the Jewish
-
t yp e  m usic.  
My sister was supposed to give a speechbutshe started crying so she didn'tdo that.T hey told 
a little bit about the history of  what hadhappened. Reinhart read one ofm y m other's letters. 
 

 
I'm  trying to think what else.T here was all kinds of  inf orm ation about it and about 
what had happened to the people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And did the townspeopleturn outfor that? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
There was som e young people. I think they wer e Reinhart's school, 
actually. There were other people.T here was also a guard because they expectedneo
-
Na zis
,  
which was a little unnerving, to say the least.
 
 
It was all in Germ an. I took Germ an inhigh schooland college and Idon't 
understand Germ an
.  
There was a lot of talking about what happened topeople, how they had 
been taken, where they were sent. A lotof  history, a lot of inf orm ation about what happened to 

people afterwards. If ound it moving and Ididn't understand a wordof  it. W hen I cam e 
hom e I 
had it translated.
 
 
Oneof  the things I 
f
orgot to mention. Reinhart founda list
,  pa
ges and pages, down 
to the rags, of everything that was inm y parents' house.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
An inventory of  everything in thehouse.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
B ert le  lo o
ked at it and said there used to be af ancy doll that they weren't 
allowed to play with in the living room  but that wasn't on the inventory. Somebody had taken 

th a t.
 
 
It was a very hom emade kind of thing. It wasn't sleek like we're used to when we see 
c o mm
em orations.W ewere really glad that we had been to it.
 
W hen we f irst went, Bertle was 
talking to people she had gone to school with inf irst grade. Som ebody had died when they 

were in f irst grade. Sothey were busy talking about this kid thatdied. It was
 
like if  you go back 
to your hom etown. And to thef irst day, Bertle translatedf orm e. Af ter that she didn't
.  Bu t  lu c k ily 
R
einhartand his wif e speakEnglish, sothatworked out.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou for that question.
 
 
Do we have anotherone?W ehave
 
one right here. Yes, sir.
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I can hear you. 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question is, If  you couldwalk into a timem achine and Nazi leadership 
cam e out on stage, what would you say to them ? 
 
>> E s t h e r
 
Starobin:
 
Good grief.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
You know, I have never actually thoughtabout it. But when I think about it, 
I guess I wouldask why they f elt they needed
 
--
 
in order to get ahead, they hadtopersecute. 
W hydid they need to do th
at? 
 
 
I mean, I know I've read a lot of history, I've takenthis class.W hatm akes people
 
--
 
even today, wh y do people
 
--
 
why the need to stigm atize other people tom ake yourself  
strong?W hat isthe needfor it? 
 
 
You have me stumped. I don't know
 
--
 
oh, I
 
think it's a terrif ic question. And I'm  going 
to think about it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And your response I think isexactl y ri ght.W hy? Ithink everybody would have 
a very sim ilar response to that. 
 
 
I have another questionfor you bef ore we close. Have you bee
n to Auschwitz? 
 

 
16
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
No. I've been to the one in Munich.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkwe're going to close our program  now. One last vie w f or questions.
 
 
Ok.W e're going to close in a moment. Oh, we do have another question. I'm sorry. 
O k.  
>>
 
He
llo. T hank youfor sharing your story. I'm  curious and inspired abouthow empowered 
and independent yoursisters were throughout the story. I was wondering if  you could talk just 

brief ly about your thoughts on that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
She's im pressed with how
 
empowered your sisters were and if  you could say a 
few words about that.
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
I think it'sf ascinating. Because it was a time when wom en really were not. 
But they really were. Itjust am azes me.W e laugh in m yf am ily that we have very stron
g 

wom en inourf am ily and the men who marry in better beware.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
I think they hada very strong feeling of  self . I think particularly in my sister, 
B e rt l e
,  
who did all kinds of  things when we were growin g up, whenwe hadf am ilies to make 
sure we spent time together,that the kids
 
--
 
m y parents would have had 10 grandchildren, and 
other than one who lives in New Mexico someplace, they're pretty close. Ithinkm y sister really 

worked at it. Shefelt her m otherhad told herthat
 
shehad to keep herf am ily together. And the 
fact thatI have all of this fam ily people here,m ostof  whom  have heard what I have to say 

several tim es bef ore, is really
 
--
 
it reall y shows that why they f eel
 
--
 
we all went to college. 
None of  that would ha
ve happened. I mean,m y parents maybe had sixth grade education if  

that. My sisters, only Ruth went to college.Edy got her G.E.D.and took some college courses 

but she was really sm art. I think they just hada good sense of  self . Now, where it cam ef rom  I
 
don't know. Maybe circumstancesf orced them  into being ver y strong. They really were ver y 

strong people
, e
xceedingly strong.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou all for really som egreat questions.W e're going to have to wrap up 
n o w. I'm  so rry. I'm  g
oing to turnback to Esther in am om ent to closeour program . I want to 
thank all of youf or being here with us today.I rem ind you we wil l have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
p r o gr am s  
eachW ednesday andT hursday until them iddle of August.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs
on
 
that our First Person gets the last word. So Esther 
wi ll close our program. W hen shef inishes, Joel, ourphotographer,wi ll come up on stage.He's 

going to take a photograph of  Esther with youas the background. So we ask you to stay with 

us until we do
 
tha t.
 
 
Esther? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:
 
For m e,I don'tthinkm ost of  us are going to be in aposition to affect tons 
of  people.W hat we can do is help one person, two people. I think what we can do as 

individuals is to see peopleas individuals and to helpencourage, dowhat we can in a sm all 

wa y. And if  we all do things in a small way, it wi ll im prove the world in abig wa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
