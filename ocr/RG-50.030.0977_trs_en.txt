ewhere, somebody

. But we did not Œ when the y dis-dispersed the famil ies into 
settlements, it was 
a 
completely different situation. 
Q: Well, from what  I understand from the hist ory, it was that there was a land reform 

act.
 
A: Yeah, this is Œ oh, l ook at the Danish people, look at t he German, you see the y do 
very well, you know? 
Q: On single farm Œ single family farms. 
A: Yeah, 
yeah ,
 
that wasthe motivation.
 
Q: And what you™re describing is much more t he Russian 
mir
 system, where Œ 
where villages were collected in one place. That is, they lived in one place. 

A: The y Œ t he y were not collected. They origi nal, the y grew from there, and the one, 

and then the neighbor, ah, I like you, I wil l be here, also, I will, I will ma Œ  
Q: Yeah Œ no, no, no, not Œ not Œ 
A: It grew. 
Q: Œ yeah, I Œ I used the wrong word. It was Œ it was natural, it was Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ not a Œ not a forced thing. 
A: Yes. 

Q: But that old system had people, the people who worked the land li ved in an Œ in 
one sort of area Œ 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

17
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ but the land was somewhere el se. The land was not  Œ 

A: Land Œ t he land Œ each one had, you know, different spots there, and there, and 

there. 

Q: Tell me Œ 
A: Later they joined, they said, okay, let™s have each one of us should ha Œ have al l 
our, y
ou know, little Œ t hose places, in one place. 
Q: That™s ri ght. So that, if you had different plots of land in different areas, it™s all 

united, and you have this one larger plot Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ from the several. So, this was something significant for interwar years for 

Lithuania
, which is an agricultural  country. 
A: Economically, agriculturally, y- y-
ye
- yes it was a 

 but since man 
does not li ve by bread alone Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ it was an act. We, at least the culture, t he songs, the Œ also t hat there be together 


 many human values disappeared.  

Q: It was l ost. 

A: That one Œ we became wolves. 
Q: Really? 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
June 29, 2018 
 
 
 
18
 
A: You know, each one, you know Œ you know, I am on my own, you Œ you know, 
I™m there, you know, I have my own. Before, i t was all together, it  was a community. 

Q: How Œ how large Œ 

A: Now, we are dreami ng about getting back i nto communities. 
We™re met 
Œ w
e 
destroyed t hem. 
Q: That happens a l ot. That happens a lot. How large a farm, then Œ  
A: Twenty acres. We had the 
top with 20 acres
. 
Q: So, it would have been more in hectares, it would have been wa Œ about 30 

hectares, or somethi ng? 

A: I Œ I never understood the difference in size of Œ when we sa y in English, one 

acre, and I don™t know. All I know that our farm was about one Œ at some point, 

because I Œ t o improve m y health, which I said, that™s anot her big story, I Œ I p-
picked up running Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ one kilometer.
 
So, we measured, with my brother 
Adolfas
, from one end to t he 
other end from the farm was almost exactly a kilometer. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And we ran Œ he was Œ 
that™s what 

 run.  
Q: And how fast could you run it?
 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
June 29, 2018 
 
 
 
19
 
A: I was act ually i mproving, so that I even part icipated in competit ions. One 
kilometer. Onekilomet erwas my distance.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And I practiced i t until I was like 60 - 65.  

Q: No kidding, really? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s t he basis of m y Œ 
whenpeople like oh, you 
Œ 
you 
Œ 
you 
Œ oh, 96 

 sa ys, you have t o Œ you know, you have to take care of your Œ your 

Œ it does not come Œ 

Q: Naturally.  

A: Œ not Œ 
especially whenthere™s so many temptations.
 
Q: Well, one of the reasons I ask the size of the farm is because that also was 

significant in dividing people into classes in t he interwar years, and especially when 

there were various occupations. So five acres is a small farm. Fifty is already Œ 

A: For Œ li ke our neighbor had 40. And Œ and how that was decided was, you know, 

you 
Œ it™s t he wetlands, some marshes, or t he Œ the woods. And t hat Œ the neighbor 

who had 40 acres, some of it was very sandy, and a lot of woods, and a lot of work 
was needed to put i nto it, to make into Œ you know, usable land.

was variety, and Œ 
and earth
 
richness,and we had 
Œ we grew everyt hi ng that we 
needed to Œ for our l ife. Only we needed to buy salt. Just some i tems like that.  
Q: Did Œ was there a surplus to take to market? 
A: Yes, that™s how we farmers survived. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y grew extra rye , or potatoes, vegetables, which, you know, every Monda y 

there was a market da y in 
, and every Monda y, early, from earl y, you Œ 
if you 

read m y poetry, you wi ll find out. Every Monday there were carriages full Œ the 

roads were full of farmers on their wa y to the market. 
Q: And in your family, who woul d go?

personalities. Your father™s, your mother™s and your older siblings. So, let™s start 
with father. What kind of a personality did he have? 

A: I Œ I think that he always wanted to Œ I Œ see, I don™t know his childhood, I don™t 

know his youth, you know, growing up time. I only began knowing hi m when he 

was, you know, 55, or with the Œ you know, a Œ a grown- up, and doing work on the 

farm. He was a typical farmer. But he was also a dreamer, because I alwa ys felt that 

he really Œ there was some very good reason why he did not continue his carpentry, 
because that
™s
 what he was interested in. He was like the poet carpent er. But sil Œ 
question of survival, we could not survive from t hat, so he Œ he sort of stuck to the 
farm.

Ì 
?  
A: That™s what I™m leading to, stuck together. 
Q: Oka y, okay. 
A: And each of those areas had occasionally got together, and the y usually got 

together in our house. And m y father, our fat her was alwa ys, for as far as I

was not very invol ved in any. She was alwa ys helping, you know, my father, and on

religious hymli Œ hymns. Melodies, no Œ 
no more,
 just like melodies. And I knew, I 
recognized t hem. Just for herself, quietly, not loud, for herself. But you could hear. 
You could hear. And Œ and she was very, I would sa y mystical. Which was also a 
joke someti mes in the fami ly, because Œ and that made her very angry. Sort of, in her 

own wa y angry, because she used t o come from milking cows and tel l oh, I saw the 

rydien

cre 
Œ little peopl e on that blue stone, on

some kind? 
A: No appa Œ no appari tions.  
Q: What di d she see?

Q: And she™d get upset , because they didn™t believe her Œ  

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ her Œ her telling.

was Œ 
because of 
her mysticalsort of

there, and some of it I remember li ke un-direct l y, and un-directly, I know that I™m 

right, but I cannot feel Œ 
put my 
Œ  you know, fingers on Œ on Œ on Œ on Œ on facts, on 
specifics, that I™m no Œ I know that  I™m right un-direct, about the feelings of the 
people there.  I know Œ remember very clearly, you know, sort of, you know, what I

heard Œ some gli mpses out there, and I don™t need 
everyt
hi ng literal ly, from 
A 
to 
Z 
to make m y 
Œ 
m y 
Œ 
m y 
observations, 
yes.
 
Q: I understand that. I understand that. It i s Œ excuse us Œ  oka y. There are Œ 
I™m 
going to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be i n two parts. One, in trying 

to say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of 
interviews l ike this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When Œ when we Œ when 
we conduct them, t he strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say,  you know 

you™re right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories. 

A: The danger is alwa ys to have Œ make it too narrow, too restricted. Permit a lit  Œ 

me 
to open that™s there, and Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ which someti mes, on direct memories observations, 
are more truthfulthan 
Œ 
than factual someti mes, factual. 

Q: Well,
 that Œ people say that about art. 

A: Yes. 

Q: That Œ but in the Œ in the purpose of what we™re doing here, is we™re trying to 

establish an histori cal record, through the memories of people, decades after the 

events happened. And Œ and that™s why, in some ways, it  is a counter kind of 

purpose. And, I would say, you know Œ 
A: Why?
 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

Q: Œ f orgive me for that. Because as much as possible, I need to anchor things i n 
context, in dates, in understanding. So I think Œ a-and I think it Œ 

A: But that™s what  you are getting.  

Q: I know. But here™s t he thing. What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But 

that is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at t his 
interview, ma y not. So that™s why I want t o repeat it back, and see if I have 
understood it properly, so that someone el se can understand it properl y. 

A: Yeah, do it. 

Q: Oka y. So, here™s what I™m under Œ here™s the i mpression I™m getting, is that at  

some point  in 1936, or 1937, because that™s the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it 

is a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the Œ 

separate from the living room, and lying and hearing Œ lyi ng down i n your bed, and 
hearing others in your family, behi nd the curtains, talking about politi cs. 
A: Not o-others, only one: 
Povilas
 and hi s invi ted friends. 

Q: Ah, oka y, not your father Œ 

A: No, no, no Œ 

Q: Œ no Œ not anybody else. 

A: Œ no, no. 

Q: And so these are young men.

A: No, the y Œ t
hey had theirown 
 
 they sl ept in t he complete 
different 
area.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you Œ for example, at that ti me, you™re about 14 years old. Your brother is 
already a young man, he™s around 23 - 24 years old. And he invites hi s friends over, 
and the y™re t alking about the Spanish Ci vil War, and they™re talking about social  

democrac y of a certai n kind, and i n the end, they sing ﬁ
The Internati onale
,ﬂ in 

Lithuanian. And then you remember, but you didn™t know this at the time, but you 

remember at some point in later years, heari ng that when 
Justas
 
Paleckis
, who i s 
someone most American or English speaking people woul d not know about, but 

Justas Paleckis
 was a l eftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country, 
became the president, quote, unquote. I don™t remember hi s exact ti tle, but 

 
was the first party secretary, 
Paleckis
 was the president, and under hi s signature, a 
lot of people get sent to 

, both then, and later. And what you are sa ying is that 
you intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because 
Paleckis Œ 
A: Now I remember why. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y Œ t he name of the monthly was called 
Joniemas
(ph).

Q: 
Joniemas
(ph). 
A: 
Joniemas
(ph). A
nd the y both wrote from it  Œ for it. And ma ybe 
Paleckis
 was 

connected with the edit orial staff, or somet hing. But that ™s th Œ how they Œ 
they sort 

of Œ 

Q: What their connection was.  
A: Œ the connection was, that she wrote Œ she published some poems, a-and his 
daughter sent to me some of those poems, they were sort of po Œ okay, I mean, 
t h e y 

would call it at littl e Œ the leftist kind of Œ 
no, wa 
Œ politically Œ t he y™re obviously 
political poems. 

Q: Oka y, and about when would Œ would have this been before the war? Befor Œ 

A: Thi-This Œ this was before. 

Q: Oka y, so during independence times. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Oka y. And so, your brother is trusted enough by 
Paleckis
 wa Œ  
A: To ask for his opini on. 

Q: Œ to Œ for his opinion to be asked, should 
Paleckis 
take that post, which was quite 

Œ 

A: I don™t know what that discussion was, but I understood that I do not remember 

my
 brother™s voice. But I think was to the Œ in some wa y, he was consulting him, 
should I take it, or not, tryi ng to make up his mi nd. And I have no idea what my 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

63
 
brother told hi m. All I know that he Œ I understood from all of us Œ 
lat e 
Œ he told me 
this later, later, later. 

Q: What does later mean? 

A: Already in Œ in ™71, when I Œ 

Q: Oka y, when you went back. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Oka y. So this is 30 years Œ 33 years later, something l i Œ well, sa Œ 30 years later. 
A: My Œ 
m y brother
 
is a 
Œ fell out of that Œ went to the Œ very soon, after the Soviets 
came in, my Œ
 Povi las
 
come 
Œ went Œ 
come 
Œ abandoned that direction, completely. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. But he had it. In other words, if there was a direct ion of political thinki ng 
in your family, through po Œ and 
Povilas
 sounds like the most political Œ 
A: The other two brothers, the y were not polit ical at all.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y were totally farmers, kind of immersed in Œ in the world of their own, l ocal. 

Q: And your father as well? 

A: Yes, very much. 

Q: Oka y. But 
Povilas
 was an influence on you. 
A: Yes, yes, he was, in this Œ 
his books, hisbooks, yes.

Q: Oka y. 
A: No, I Œ I sort of looked up a lit tle bit, you know, yes. 

Q: So Œ 

A: Not in t hat Œ that Œ his political 
world was totally 
Œ li ke he subscribed Œ 
subscribed to so Œ 
Soci aldemokratas
, a weekly newspaper, which was you know, so 
Œ so Œ social 

 Lit huanian party. And I could Œ I Œ I Œ I hated it.  

Q: Did you really? 

A: It w-was so boring and so serious, and so the whole Œ I could not be Œ I just Œ 

Q: So i-it Œ it didn™t speak to you. 

A: He used to subscribe to it. No, no. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That was totally out  of m y interest. 
Q: Oka y, oka y. Thank you. That™s what ga Œ t hat™s what I wanted to get a sense of, 
of what was the Œ not onl y the facts of pre-war life, 
of youknow, the circumstances 

of your family, but also the at mosphere. You know, what did people t alk about? 

What was their worl d, what mattered to them?  And in Œ i n Œ in very specific ways Œ 

A: So, there are gli mpses that there were talks, political talks 

 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ betwe Œ in which, you know, about which I cannot tell more t han what I just  
told.

Q: Yeah. So Œ 
A: That™s one memory I think is pretty oh Œ revealing. 

Q: Yeah. So we come to 1939, and Œ 

A: And more Œ more than that, that  Œ like between 
Papilys
 and 
Semeniıkiai
, t here 

was a village of

Q: 

. 
A: And pu Œ if you have to fix sometimes some shoes, or also the Œ some sewing to 

do, some Œ there was some Œ a family, I think, of two brothers, perha Œ the-
the y were
 

very Œ 
they were
 special at crafts 

 
Q: So the y were Œ 

A: So, I used, sometimes, to stop 
if my f 
Œ mother gave to fix something there, and 
the y, whenever I was there, they were only tal king politics. 
Q: Really? 
A: An-And like all Œ li ke oh, you see, sorry for this mess. The police was here last 

night, and the y look for, you know, everything turned, you know, they look for Œ 

Q: Upside- down. 

A: Upside- down. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because they were talk Œ they were really involved, so much that the police was

Q: The y had sociali st orientations? 
A: The y were, ma ybe t here were some publications Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Or the y were maybe involved Œ oh yes, now I remember that that week, on the 

branches of the trees by the road, by the cemeteries, and t he cemeteri es were by our 
house, there were some leaflets attached again, political leaflets. I have no idea what 
they promoted. And it was next da y after that, that I had to stop at their house in 


 
Œ 

 for something, and the police was Œ and I saw that, you know, 
everything was 
Œ was in a mess. The police was there. The y probably suspected t hat 
they produced those leaflets and hung them there. 

Q: Were the y known to have a particular pol iti cal view? 

A: N-N Œ people ma ybe knew. I had no idea. 
Q: So, it could have been they were very leftist. 
A: I Œ I wil l not have any ideas that there were any other views t han those that came 

from Œ 
from 
Œ from 
Kauna s
, from the capital. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I-I was not in that age, and I was still i n my shell. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But those were gli mpses into t he real world, which I remember very well, that 
there were people who were doing something, I don™t know wh-why, and what Œ for 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

what reasons, and what  is said, what was i n those leaflets. Because police came, 
people said, oh don™t touch them. Let the police do Œ come, and took, so I had no Œ 

had no idea what was in those leaflets. 

Q: So, you don™t know if they were right wing or left wing? 

A: Ki Œ kil l Œ kill Œ kill 
Smetona
, or Œ 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: Œ or emb Œ or embrace 
Stalin
, I d
on™t know.
 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I have no idea. 

Q: When 1938 Œ well, actually, 1939 come around Œ 

A: I want t o interrupt one more. 

Q: Sure. 
A: Same as later, when the Germans, same as Soviets, they did not come blindly, 
with no preparations. They had already people watching for years, probably, and 

some of them were connected, preparing, you know, here and there and there. Like 

Germans had same. Some of them Œ some of those people ma ybe were, you know Œ I 

don™t kn-know. But none of those occupiers came with, l ike th
e y do now,sometimes 

they just go to another country, wi th Œ I think the y had planted peopl e. I™m thinking 

that now. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

Q: Yeah. Yeah. So, let™s come to 1939. Do you remember whether there was any 
reaction in 
Semeni ıkiai
, or 
, or 
Papilys
, about the German attack on 
Poland
, 
September first? 

A: There were two reactions. The dominant reaction was ah, we have 
Vilnius
 now 

back. 
Q: Because of the controversy wit h 
Poland
 on 
Vilnius
. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Vilni us
 was the center Œ 
there was produced happiness. The 
Œ the P oles 
were the most hated nation in the world, for Li thuanians. 
Q: Why?
 
A: Why? The Œ 

Q: For Œ we have five Œ 

A: The y took 
Vil nius
. The y took our capit al away. 

 
Q: So that™s a little ditty in Lithuanian, about Poles. 

A: No. Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No, no, they were Œ 
they™re more
 
Pilsudski s
, and all those Œ those guys, they Œ 
they were all  most hated people. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So th Œ there was el ation when the Œ the R ussians decided to Œ to Œ to 

 event ually put Œ attach Œ to reattach 
Vi

 to 
Lithuania
. So for

some ti me, that, al most  like sort of Œ that elation, almost to cancel  all  the bad thi ngs 
for e Œ for Œ at least for a moment, until t he y began to thi nk, you know, and see, oh, 

they™re bad, bad 

. The y are the 
[inde

 
Q: So you said there was another. There was Œ there were two react i ons. One was 

nice Œ 
A: Oh, the other reacti on that sa ys oh, now Œ now Œ 
now,we ma y haveanother war. 
We are having another war, and Œ and Œ and Œ 

Q: So people started talking a
bout that?
 
A: Yes, yes, the y did Œ I Œ I don™t remember 
 
 but I Œ I Œ I cannot  
con Œ yes, every family already knew that t his is bad. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That this is bad. 
Q: Oka y. Now, was the Œ when you menti on that Œ that 
Russia
 
attached 
Vilnius
 
back to 
Lithua nia
, why would 
Russia 
do Œ  
A: 
Idon™t knowreally, again my mem 
Œ see, I am very bad at dates Œ at which point 
that became real, because first the Œ oka y, 
Germany
, and the Œ t he
y met 
Œ 
they made 
a deal with Russians, and the y wanted, sort of, 
Poland
. 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: But at which point Œ and then Russians march into 
Lithua nia
 only in 1940.  
Q: Thirty-nine.

A: Thirty-nine? 
Q: Thirty-nine. 

A: Oh, so i mmediately, so that deci sion was Œ 

Q: What 
Œ what the Œ what the Œ 
t he factual reference 
Œ 
A: All I remember 
b oy 
Œ being in 
Papilys
 in sixth grade, i n the bench, sitting there 
in the middle of the class, and the 
teacher 
Œ somebody comes in and t ake the teacher 
out, and then the teacher returns, and asks everybody to l isten carefull y, and tell s that 

the war start ed, and that Œ and the Soviets Œ that the message was given to the 

teacher, and that was the situation. So Œ and so that Œ that™s how we found out what 

happened. 

Q: Oka y. The background to this, from what I Œ from what I have read, is that t hat 

Molotov
-
 
 was signed in August, 1939 Œ August 23
rd
, and one week 
later, September first, i s when 
Hitler 
attacks 
Poland
. And sometime in the fall, I 
believe it was October, I could be wrong, t he Soviets start marching in, and that i Œ 

then Œ start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940. 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like, yeah. 

Q: Oka y. So, duri ng that Œ those several months, did you continue going to school, 

did you 
Œ 
A: That was very intense, that was m y first, you know, no Œ 
yes

have been 17 years old in December 1939. And were you then Œ by then in 
gymnasium in 
Bir
, or still Œ 
A: No, no, no, I was in this Œ sixt h gr Œ sixth Œ fifth Œ sixth grade in 
Papilys
. I was in 

Papilys
. 
Q: Oka y, you were still  in sixth grade Œ 
A: I Œ I went Œ began going to school very late, because I was needed on the farm
. 
And then, after the fourth grade, I skip one year again, before going to the fifth 

grade. So t here were many Œ I was not Œ the family was not even sure if I will, you 

know, ever go to hi gh school or gymnasium.  

Q: Oka y, oka y, okay. That Œ that Œ 
that makes sense.
 
A: Because first I was still very Œ I was not in the best of Œ m y weakness body 
remained for a good Œ until I was fif Œ di Œ 16. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s al l. And I did not talk to anybody, I was always 
 
. I did 
not communicate with anybody. And su
d 
Œ and Œ and I Œ no, and it happen, as things 

happen, that suddenly I Œ I Œ I Œ for some reason, I wanted to tal Œ I was ready t o 

talk. So, neighbors said, he talks, oh, he tal ks. It became 
a 
Œ a joke. I was known as 

the silent Œ  you know.

time.

A: No, I was Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ I was in a shel l. 

Q: And then Œ 

A: And I remained in t he Œ in the shell, I mean, to Œ 
 today, I™m in a shell.  
Q: What are your first memories of life changing, when the Soviets appeared in 

Lithuania
? What  are your first memories of that? 

A: Fear was Œ you began to feel Œ 
I mean,
 feel fear. You could feel it floating over, 

like everybody Œ li ke how it manifested, that fear, I cannot describe now. But you 

could feel it, and see it in the Œ 
in the 
Œ almost in the physical movements, in the 
faces, and how Œ in the relationship. And silences here, and Œ creep i n, and Œ and 
then you 
Œ we i mmediatel y began hearing about neighbors being arrested there. It  wa 
Œ it started before the mass deportations, even those small deportati ons and arrests Œ 
Q: Of people you knew? 

A: Yeah Œ 
hm?
 
Q: Of people you knew? 

A: 
 
 not in our village, but in the neighboring vil lages, you cou Œ 
you know,  families, and all individuals, you immediately heard. You know, that  Œ

that became be Œ happening Œ began happening i mmediat ely after the Soviets 
marched in. 

Q: Was the Œ and so, what about Œ 

A: We talk about, you know, the big deportati ons. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But small arrest s and deportations began i mmediately.  
Q: Did your schoolteachers change? 

A: Yes, the at mosphere felt like Œ like Œ like the de Œ joyful hap Œ sort of blissful, 

careless atmosphere 

 like some cloud began descending. 
Q: Did that mean that t he teacher who might have formerly been a fri endly teacher, 

now became more closed, or did it  mean it was a new teacher? 

A: No, the y were the same, but you could al most feel, you know, a certain kind of 
seriousness, a different kind of Œ it changed da Œ through the village, it ™s Œ I mean, i-
i-it™s difficult to describe how a system, repressive system like t hat, and especially 

when you begin to see the actual, real results can begin to affect the whole Œ th-the Œ 

and like produces kind of invisible at mosphere there, that i s there. You cannot 

describe it, but 
yo u 
Œ you Œ you feel it™s there. 
Q: Let™s cut  for a second. 
 
 Oka y. 
A: And then, some of the neighbors that had a larger houses were Œ i mmediately 
there Œ some rooms were divided by the Œ by t he order from the Œ

Q: Oka y. 
A: Planted there as Œ as sort of Œ I Œ had to be, you know, you had to accept. 
Q: So, was there anybody that you knew who was locally known to have been a 

sympathizer of the Soviets, when they came?  

A: Not in t he lib Œ  not i n the villages that I Œ not in our villages. 

Q: So strangers, it was really strangers who came, or Œ who came and were planted 

in the villages, but not l ocal people who suddenl y Œ

Q: Œ unmask, and say alright, I™m a Œ  
A: No, no Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ no, we did not know, and at l east I have doubted there were, you know, ca-

cases and pl aces. But Œ where that happened, but in the few vill

Right, but I was i n the fifth, not sixth grade. Then, one year I skipped. I have notes

 Since I was t oo old Œ you had to be certain age t

 kid has to go to Œ so, because he sort of, I 
guess, believed in me. 

Q: Did the y have t o pay? Did it cost to send you to high school? 
A: No, no.  
Q: No. 

A: It was free. So, that year, I decided to learn to go to Œ to Œ to am Œ he helped m y

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yes. He was never in 
Papilys

Q: Now, the bagel shop Œ excuse me now. 
A: Ye-Ye
ah.
 

Q: The bagel shop, was that in a Jewish neighborhood? Was there a Jewish 

neighborhood? 

A: I do not Œ I Œ there must be 
clattered
 i n the different areas of 
. I Œ I only 
remember that there was Œ you know, I know there was a Œ not mok Œ what do you 
call that
, mosque 
Œ 
Q: The synagogue. 
A: Synagogue. I don™t remember any specific Jewish area, but there must have been.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because even in 

, when I moved, I was as Œ as you can see, I did not have 
time to walk around, and know the city. To skip si Œ you know, six classes, imagine 
Œ five Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And even later, I was not that Œ I was Œ  I sti ll remain
ed
 a book person. I did not Œ 
I Œ I did not famil Œ now I regret it, I did not vo Œ 
familiarize more wi ththe
 
city. But 

Œ 

Q: But you Œ in other words, you didn™t reall y know whether or not it was 

neighborhood that was predominantly Jewish, or not. It was just a neighborhood. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
June 29, 2018

A: No, you could see them there and there and there, different stores, scattered 
through the whole city. I did not Œ tell you the truth, I did not know the Œ did not Œ 

was not aware. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Even th Œ ma ybe there was, but  I was not aware. I under-ders
tood that
 the y were 
every 
Œ you know, scat tered.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Through the all, sort of Œ there was some bur Œ suburban par-parts, where there 

were no Jews, but in the center, they were ev Œ you know, there and there and there 

and there. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I did not even Œ could not even tel l how many, you know? I figure that t here 
must be, in a city of 5,000, which I was tol d by the ma yor of 
 
later, in 
Brooklyn 
Œ he had the 

 in 
Brooklyn
. 
Q: Oh, he also went Œ he Œ he was also an Œ a refugee, in 
Brooklyn
? 
A: Yes. 
 
(ph). 

Q: 

(ph), oka y.
 

A: Ye-Yeah, that Œ t here were five Œ at that point was five. He would have known 

the Œ how many Jews there may have been. I figured that there ma y be two Œ 300. 
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
June 29, 2018 
 
 
 
80
 
A: But then later Œ now I Œ I keep the information that I have seen was that there 
were 2,000 Jews still in 
? Sa ys, how could that be? Because t hat means that 

5,000 people lived in 

, and t here were 2,000 plus killed, that means almost like 

a half. So th-there is somet hing wrong, but I t hink that t hat figure comes that when 

the Jews were killed in 
, they brought them from all  other pl aces, like 
including 
Papilys
. 
Q: Oka y.  

A: Probably that™s what Œ that™s how the 2,000 come. Th Œ it does not come from t he 

city itself.
 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It comes Œ I think they collected from all other areas, and then th-thi-this Œ this is 

Œ this is the place where we™ll dump 

  
Q: We™ll come to that. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But right now, we™re Œ chronol ogically, we™re in that first Soviet year of 

occupation, where you 
Œ during this ti me is when you skip four classes, through your 

uncle™ s sort of both suggestion and Œ and strong advice Œ 

A: So my first gymnasi um class, the seventh, was already Œ was under the Soviets. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Yeah.

Q: Do you remember anything in particular from that year, in that  cla Œ in this Œ in 
this grade?  

A: Oh yes, I k Œ 
I remember.
 
Q: What 
Œ what can you tell us about it? 
A: I mean, t here Œ one Œ one thing is Œ is that we i mmedi ately in this, besides la Œ 
that Œ no, no, no, no, the first Œ first year was still Œ there were no Russians the first 
year.
 
Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: That™s why I had one year of French Œ not fr Œ that Œ actually, before that, I had 

two years of French, and Latin, because the next, in the grade, under t he Soviets, 

first then went out, Latin out.  

Q: Oka y. 
A: French out, Russian in. French no good, Latin no good, Russian good. So I had at 
least one year Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ of Œ 

Q: Russian. 

A: Œ Russian. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

Q: Well, that would make sense, because the government, in July 1940, is when 
there is that  vote to joi n the 
Soviet Union
. And that woul d have been after your 

seventh class Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ but before your eighth. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And then, one new category was introduced, the polit ical education. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The political teacher, political Œ  

Q: And who was t he political teacher?  

A: Don™t remember his name. But very boring, talking like somebody who tells t hat 
this is what happened, this is what communist party is, and what™s 
a 
Œ it™s very good 
for the people. Talking alwa ys a very monotonous voice, and very like somebody 

who did not believe in it hi mself. Somebody who was li ke assigned mat erial, he did 
not sound that he believed in what he was Œ  

Q: Sounds like a parrot, al most. 

A: Œ what he was sa ying. But you had to learn, you know, first thing you had to learn 

by heart, the history of the communist party. A-And then, there was another one. He 
was, you know, radical Œ class to t each. That was the subject we had to learn. But

then there was anot her, assigned Œ 
a ka 
Œ general political supervisor of the

 the high school. And don™t remember her name. 
She was 
a woman of some 40 
Œ 40 Œ some 40 years, and she was always there, and 
we knew who she is, and why she is there. And when she was approaching passi ng, 

everybody became silent until she passes, and Œ but I Œ to me it™s wa Œ very, very Œ 
became very, very, v
ery important, this woman. She was also hated, hated by 
everybod
y, not 
Œ not for another re
as
 Œ that Œ because she was Jewish. And 
because 
the ma yor,asSoviets marchedin, the ma yor

Q: Wow.
 

A: And put that Œ puts where it was, just 
 
 
Q: Wow. That coul d have ended a lot differentl y. Wow. 

A: And thi  Œ and t hat™s, you know, one of the moments you never forget. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Because it could have ended badly, not onl y for me, but for Œ also for m y family, 
and Œ and we don™t know how far that would have gone. But then, all these years, I

have been also thinking, why did she do that? I mean, one thing t hat, you know, was 
Œ I was still very fragil e, and very naïve, and very Œ sort of like, she ma y have really 

meant oka y, he made Œ he™s 
a 
stupid, little guy, and he made a mistake. If I tell hi m 

ma ybe 
Œ you know, she like, had a picture of me. But then I thought, ma ybe she 

played double game. Maybe she worked also for the underground. She ma y have 
worked Œ okay, here I am, I™m hated, you know Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ by everybody. I will Œ knew that, but  I wi ll Œ will be Œ I will  also help the 

underground. She ma y have been a double l ike, agent. 

Q: Was she Œ do you know if she was from 

 herself? 

A: No, no, she Œ she was not from 
. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: But when the Œ and now, now, when you ask this question, I Œ I Œ I cannot 
guarantee, really. We assume that she came from 
Moscow
 with the Œ  you know, but 
she ma y have had some relatives i n Œ so, I wil l never know. I will  never have an 

answer, because later i n that she retreated together with t he Œ when t he Soviets 

retreated, and she was shot with other Jews. But she saved m y life. 

Q: Yes, she did. Yes, she did. And it™s interest ing how they Œ I mean, did that mean 

that they look through all the caps of the students, to see if there are papers in them?

A: No, 
the y knew. They wereeducat

K GB
 
training, you 
know, where to look next, if somebody hi des something. They knew where to look 

for Œ where people usuall y Œ they had track of record where people usually hide. 

Q: Did you speak of this to anyone at the ti me? 

A: I could not. I could not. Because I coul d not let the other students Œ they were 
asking, so what di d she tell you? I made a j oke, or something, but I could not tell , 
because then other students would know t hat they are connected wi th underground. I 

could not t alk. 

Q: And the y wo Œ 

A: And later Œ I don™t know where that was already, on the Germans. 

Q: Oka y.

want you to Œ to read this now. He said, now i t™s, you know, forbidden, even to

Q: During this time, was there any violence Œ 

A: Also, t hat Œ that Œ that happened actually very close also, to the Germans

A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And that™s wa Œ maybe why I don™t remember her name, because I met her very, 

very soon after that, yeah. 

Q: Oka y. Now, during the Soviet time, was there any open Œ you t alk about this 

atmosphere of fear, that™s even hard to describe, but it ki nd of descends. Was there 

violence? Did you see people beaten up in the street?

A: I was Œ there may have been, but I™m not aware of th Œ I was not i nvolved in it, 
and Œ and t he use of any violence against Sovi ets in 
Lithuania
 would have been 
very,very, very mu
ch kept suppressed by Œ 
by 
Œ  by this Œ would be difficult for facts 
like that to come out. 

Q: I even mean violence by Soviets. Was there any Œ 
A: The violence as psychological, and Œ or Œ or Œ or direct, you know. If you are 
arrested in Œ  you Œ 
you kno
w Œ you know what  happens 

 with so Œ 
the Œ the Œ how the Soviet police handled those whom 
the y arrested, or 
Œ or 
deported. So that™s Œ if that is not violence, then what is violence, yes. 

Q: I™m talking before t he deportati ons, the act ual deportations, in that  intra-months, 

and so on, when you talk about that, was there Œ 

A: It was an Œ it was devious
ly 
Œ t he control was like a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ oka y, it began 
immediately, because the y came with a plan. And i mmediate wa Œ sl ow was the 
critique, of course, i n t he press and presentati on of the existing, previous system, 

preparation for the Œ for 
electivizati on
; it was to take place i mmediat el y. So that 

there were Œ they were restructuring every part of the society, of the Œ if the Œ under 

the Germans, who had, you know, the y came in, in action, the y were chasing 

somebody. They had no ti me to stop and Œ and control everything. Here the y came 

in, and the y settled down. In two days the y cannot began Œ the y began exerting their 
control. If under the Germans Œ you give t hem first page of the provincial paper, for

their bulletins; it had to be, or Œ or 
 
. Then you can do whatever you 
want. Under the Soviets, not a single sent ence, not a single word we passed at Œ 
you 
cou Œ you could pass without being Œ 
without approved. Becausethey werethere. 
The y were, you know, they had nothing else t o do, but to control and Œ and 

transform it  into their own system. And t heir Œ you know, the y came prepared. 
Q: So, is that sort  of total control, you™re talking. 

A: And Œ and Œ and Œ no, we are tal king about total control. Total. Absolutely total. 

And the y al ways a Œ 
a 
Œ managed t o call up if Œ I mean, many came already prepared 
from 
Moscow
, the key persons. But many satellites, local, either Œ at the beginning, 
ma ybe even had some dreams and fantasies that this ma y be good, we can, you 

know, the Œ when Œ because all the propaganda was, you know, that t his is it, t his is 

great, this is wa y Œ you know, that  was real  bad, and now we™ll be paradise. And 
some felt Œ some sort of believed that, ma ybe not hundred percent, but th-th Œ 
t h e y 
thought that the y can also have some impa Œ i mpact themselves, and the y say that, 

what I will do a lit Œ with we will shift it that way, we™ll be oka y, maybe, ma ybe. So 

what happened later, li ke a Œ ma ybe when the deportations began, is something else. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The b
e 
Œ e-even t hose who 
real b
elieved that Œ that ma ybe had fantasies about  
that this could

Q: Yeah. 

A: When he was already Œ  he was already out. 
Q: Oka y, what was Œ was he still studying? 
A: But he was struggle still, you know, leftist, and he sort of Œ he had some ideas. 

Whi
ch is nothing wrong. But Œ but he was out of the Œ of the Œ if he had even any 
dreams that ma ybe this was 
clear
 with Œ immediately, it was clear t o anybody. 
Q: At this point, 
Povilas
 would have been about, oh, 28 years old, something li ke 
that. 

A: He Œ

A: He was Œ became al so very closed just in his profession. He did not write any 

more, did not publ ish.

have had, you know. And you have this inner i mmigration, what t he East Germans 
call

, you know? 

A: Yeah, you know, that™s Œ that™s what Œ 
they saidthat. Unfor
tunatel y, the whole Œ 
this 

 communists started in their ow Œ in their own country, and 
their own time. 
Q: I want t o touch on something else that you mentioned earlier. And you said Œ and 
that™s on the Œ the anti- Semitic aspect. You say that both the 
po li truka
 Œ  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and the ma yor, were hated Œ 

A: I think t hat Œ that fact that both were Jews, to the farmi ng community, who had 

just 20 years earlier, managed to li berate from tsars, and had this very Œ like a sense 

of being independent, unfor Œ a-a-and still very, very fragile. To Œ t o Œ to see that we 
are again of controlled by somebody else, if not tsars, then Jews, somebody. I thi nk 
that these un Œ it was not Œ I could feel that. It was not talked much about, but jo Œ j-

jokes were made about 

. I don™t remember those jokes, but Œ but 
then the Russians Œ now we had again Russians, and the Jews, and t he Œ a-a-
and the 

Œ and I think that t hat aspect Œ this has not been Œ ma ybe i t has been written about, 

sort of mentioned t hat t his instituted just fresh liberation. And now again, somebody 

else is there, on the Œ on top of us. Had i mportant effect, on the why some were Œ

especial
 Œ the killing of Jews, coincided wi th t he big deportation, you know, of 
Lithuania
. But that mi ni mized, I t hink, si mp Œ sympathi es for what was happening, 
at the same time, to the Jews.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: It affect how much, you know, the Œ li k

affected

this and this, the other 
 
. But definitely, yes. 
Q: And had you heard before, like in Œ before these events, before the Soviet 
takeover, had you heard people make jokes about Jews, or say anti-Semi tic things? 

A: No, no, no, Jews were some Œ and what Œ even if I could read i n those transcripts 

from 
BBC
, and lat er in the Œ you know, was t ypi ng them, it™s still Œ i t was so 
outrageous, that many did not bel ieve that this really happened. 
Q: Oka y, what Œ 
A: Sa ying that you don™t re Œ hu-human beings are not made up t o react personally 

to Œ to abominable events. Like, oka y, I Œ I have to confess that I did not react to the 

9-11 ev
ent, untilI saw 
Œ met some, really peop Œ people who just managed to 

escape. Or the Œ or the Œ the firemen from 
SoHo
, right t here where I live, then Œ then 
it became real. When I watched the buildings collapse, and I knew that thousands of 

people are there collapsing, I-I had no emotional res Œ it™s like, it  was too big. It was 
too big.

Q: Not that you Œ does it mean that when you had no emotional response, you di dn™t 
care, or it was too big? 

A: No, no, that you Œ that you are not made physically t o Œ it™s Œ it™s like too bi g. 

Abstract. Too big. Only when Œ it  has to become more personal.  

Q: Well, you know Œ 
A: I will tell you later another story where 
the si 
Œ killing of the Jews. 
Q: Oh, you know, that reminds me of what 
Stalin
 
said, which many peoplesa y 
was 
his strategy and his tactic, that the death of six million, or Œ he di dn™t use the word 

six million, but t he death of a million is a stati stic, the death of one person is a 

tragedy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: You know, I™m paraphrasing here, but i t™s Œ 
A: Well, that™s 

 it™s too Œ it™s too big. We are not  made up 
psychologi cally 
 
 and that you need something personal, somet hing 
that you could iden Œ i dentify. So Œ 
Q: So here is m y questi on. When you Œ 

A: So when I was sta Œ people were Œ those Œ again, the nor Œ the population did not 

get that information, those newsp Œ 

 newspapers. Mostly the 

intellectual kind of community saw them. So that the rumor that oh, it™s the ge Œ you

A: Œ and the gulags, etcetera. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That was easier t o Œ to Œ to wr Œ because that was already happeni ng to 
Lithuanians. So that was at Œ easier to understand. 
Q: That was real. That was actually Œ  
A: That was real. 

Q: Œ real. Okay. 

A: What

the Lithuanians, and whoever else was not Jewish, was looking at the Jews who 
might have been put in power, and sa ying, look at, they have brought a new regi me, 
we™re not independent any more. And at the same ti me, if the y get news 
fro m some 

underground press, they don™t beli eve it too much. 

A: Yeah, but the Œ but 

 as I said before the bys Œ the population of

students in mathematics, and Œ and not far from this station. And Œ and then there, as

the Œ yesterda y th-
th
-they arrested, you know, some 

 the y are full,

train. So that™s the Œ the only thing that I Œ I could ever Œ ever under Œ you know, 

andIdon™t remember which ma 
Œ  I don™t think this was Œ because I was not in

every ti me she came back from the market, she brought us with her Œ used to make 

special, tiny sort of Œ but very tasty, bagels. And so Œ and those bagels were made by 

one Jewish family. So, of course, those who are used to buying certain things, the 

farmers that the y need, and then most of the stores, the key stores were owned by 
Jews. So t he y Œ the y went, and said, where? They could see. The y could Œ they could

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ would be summed up in a fo Œ 
paragraph there,
 no time to read, and presented 

to some loc Œ to some person the Germans had in the mayor™s office, as their 

representative. I have Œ  I don™t know the detail s, how that worked, but that was done 

already by

A: Œ yes, that, but that was normal , and nobody even read t hose Œ those Œ those cra Œ 
those pa Œ first pages. That was a Œ without it, you could not publish. And the job 

that the provincial newspapers, I t hink that the contribution of the real  work of the 

pro Œ provi ncial newspapers, during the German occupation, has t o be understood, 

and credi Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ and recognized, how despit e the sit uation and the 
politics, and the Œ t he writers managed to promote the local cultures. It was Œ dealt 
with local cultures. And that™s why I had t he series on Œ on the past, you know, ke Œ

that

A: Because the only ot h Œ possibility Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ would be oka y, now we have German occupation, so we should not write, 

should not  publish, and let Œ permi t them do everything. That will be the other

t hathascaused me many problems 

sometimes.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But I believe. If they sa y that t here was some help in Œ the Œ wh- where I doubt is 
that some of the aspects of that help are taken from the Soviets Œ Soviet sources. 
There I beco me immediately very, very skeptical. The part icipation t here, it™s clear 
there was, but when they sa y, even if it™s a mild participat ion, comparatively, so we 

will Œ we will shoot them. But you grow and protect the property t hat is left, which 

is, you know, on direct sort of difference, likely. I Œ which has been picked up from 

the Soviet sources. The Soviets were mast ers i n impli Œ in maki ng one guilty, 

inventing reason, you know, so that when 
 
 one of  friends of 
Atronas

take care, protect the properties.

like

Œ when especially, 
when I was already i n t his Œ in Œ displaced, after the war, i n

some of the young people, between 20 and 27, the y were so horri ble, the y were Œ 

the y could kill anybody an Œ I mean, the y could steal, rob, kill. And t hey came from 

the Œ some were volunt eers in the German army, some were drafted by force, but 
while in the army, the y became like that, but some volunteers. So, I have no doubt 
that they could have shot Jews, or anybody, with Œ with no blink of the e ye. The y 

were so Œ and Œ and I was living among some of them Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ in Œ i mmediately after the war, because t hey were, you know, just from the

Q: Well, you were in a literary world, not Œ that™s Œ it sounds to me that that™s what 
you are trying to tel l me, is that it was literature and Œ 
and culture 
Œ  
A: That™s al l Œ was only one part. My retreat into the shel l was caused by m y il lness.

But it was Œ I was read Œ you know Œ I Œ before I sent Œ took to t he printer, I always

discovered. I mean, it was 
Œ it was bad, but hi s reaction was Œ 
why di dn™t

th e y 
Œ somehow they had Œ

we had developed Œ we have developed a rela Œ I had developed a relation
,  my 
Œ and 
with my 
br -brother, wit h French prisoners, because the y had Œ the y could get 
packages from home. They could get books, and so the y used one Œ when one of 

them discovered that I™m Œ you know, writing poetry, I™m interested i n books, he 
used to bring me books fra Œ and I could sort of Œ well, I had two Œ like, 
one year
 
and a half of French, I could manage. And Œ and sort of a friendship developed, and 

had sort of Œ the y had certain kind of respect. Then, one da y, when we had too many 

of those worms, they decided that t he barracks should complain to the com Œ first to 

th
e ci 
Œ to t he 
Elmshorn
 Œ to the German government of Œ that is in charge of the 
camps and prisoners.

decided in our barracks, that you should be our representati ve, and go and complain

about the maggots. I said, why Œ

do it. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: S-So I go, I go to th
e 
Œ who is Œ and there sits this general, I was tau Œ told, just 
like that, and stares at me, and more or less, so Œ so what? And Œ and Œ and there I 

am, you know, I™m a nothing, in this litt le Œ  

Q: You™re a forced laborer. 

A: Œ miserable jacket, and this Œ and he looks at me, and said, oh, oh, well, we Œ we 
know Œ lately, we have these worms in the soup, and Œ and the Œ t he French 


, the y wa Œ asked me to t ell. And he listened and stil l stares. And 

then he says, oh, the soup is

. The Œ 
prima
 was one of the words used most 
during that period. 

Q: So it™s wonderful, t he soup is wonderful. 

A: Wonder 
Œ oh, you know, wa Œ and then he™s Œ begins to talk more, I don™t even 

understand. And the tone he was talking t o me, was like when one talks to a chi ld. 

He looked at me and he thought, this naï ve ki d, he does not know what he is doing, 

what Œ why he™s tel ling 

 they tell, you know, there he is, and he™s

And Œ 

Q: Were you?
 
A: No. I di d not t hink at all. I was so naïve, and so innocent. And I think that™s why 

Œ because you know, th-th-the previous two people who comp Œ complained, the y 

are not here any more. Then I Œ then, it Œ 
it
 hit  me that, you know. But when the y

the killing of the Jews, you could really try to find with the various Œ 
you need a 
strong light to find anti-Semitic article in any of those papers. 
Q: In the regional press, you™re saying? 
A: Yes. The capital, I don™t know. Regional I™m t alking only, and I™m Œ I™m quite 
familiar because I used to get in my little office in

regional papers. 

Q: But then Œ 

A: The y were all concerned for the local cultures, and the y were fed up with Œ 
they 

knew where they are, t hey knew where the Germans are, and Œ and Œ and what the 

Germans Œ Germans all about. And I Œ 
I woul dn™

where I really familiar those Œ that 

 that.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: But indirectly, in Œ i n like a kind of a rule kind of way, sent those huge articles by 

Galvanauskas
 about the future of, you know, his fantasies of Œ of the western

the Œ the Œ the person doesn™t believe what you are saying. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Be

New York Review of Books
.ﬂ We™ll tal k about that a little later. 

A: Oka y, yes. 

Q: Oka y. Let™s now then proceed to Œ is there anything el se about leaving 

Lithuania
, about working in these papers, and about any of those activities, that you 

didn™t mention before, that you™d like to talk about now, before we go on to 

Germany
?  
A: I would still Œ I would add something t  Œ about the local newspapers. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Because they felt a certain respi Œ responsi bility to their regions. And I think that 

I Œ the y have to get credit, some of the people who worked on those pe Œ 

newspapers, for helping to Œ to keep the local culture going. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And to te Œ and sometimes with even a danger, you had to out smart Œ outsmart. 

Someti mes
, I ment ion t hat some major articles had to summed up briefly, very

briefly. And there Œ 
sometimes the y 
Œ they di d not exactly translate 

 wrot e the way Œ they wrote it the wa y Germans would be Œ li ke. 
Q: Be happy with it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And the y took chances. And it™s to their credit that Œ that they managed to devote 
ma 
Œ most of their Œ the body of their newspapers to that life of not onl y what was 
happening at that period, but there is a lot of the past, alwa ys, of Œ from pieces on 

their past cultural personalities of the period, I mean going like Œ going back to 


, 
yes.
 
Q: Well, you know, two things come to mind;  is that if we™re talki ng about articles 

dealing with the past, I think East 
Europe
, if I Œ I™m going to Œ I™m going to kind of 
bring forth a stereotype, that east Europeans li ve in the past a lot, for le Œ 

A: But especially t he y Œ they Œ that Œ duri ng that ti me, there was even a need. It was 

positive, t o live in a Œ t o go back t o the past was positive. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Now is no Œ wouldn™t be positi ve, but under occupations, it was positive to be 

reminded of Œ of 
Varpas
(ph), and  of

et cetera, etcetera

Q: Oka y.

become 
Lithua nia
, an independent Œ 
Q: Country. 

A: Œ country. That was stressed, that usual ly got a lot of the Œ of space. 

Q: Here is another t hought, though, and it  also has a certain parallel i nto how people 
in the cultural sphere dealt with in Soviet ti mes, that you have Œ 
A: Here it™s very Œ t otall y different, because there you Œ you could not ri Œ choose 

your own subject, coul d not choose your s Œ your own theme, and whatever you 

wrote was the re Œ everything was read, and had to be approved. In 
Germany
, at that 
period, we don™t know what woul d have happened later, with, you know, 
a 
famili ar, 

and Œ and Œ  and know how it was during those two plus years. Because the y were in 

the war, the y were too busy. The y could Œ they did not have enough personnel, 
friends, the y were all soldiers. 

Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: To Œ 
to control every aspect.They 
con Œ what would have happened later, I don™t 
know. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Nobody knows.

Q: Yes. But when you™re talking about the Soviets, ye Œ I assume you were meaning 
the Soviet presence at that ti me, as well. That i s, that was 
 
 at that 
time. 

A: Yes, I™m talking onl y about the so Œ but th Œ we know also, that it continued. That 

the control, total control continued near Œ continued until after 
Khrushchev
, maybe, 
I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah, that™s Œ that™s what I™m saying, i s that in later decades, there was also 

wiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te Œ in t he 
Soviet 

Union 
in gener
al, and t his included 
Lithuania
, would Œ would write t heir 
perfunctory introductory paragraph,or 
Œ  
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Œ give perfunctory play Œ  
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ that was polit ical, and that was acceptable, and then t he y™d do what the y want 

to, you know. 

A: Yes, I began noticing that there, somewhere around ™75, or something Œ 

Q: And so that in some wa ys, it is sa ying oka y, we will work within the system, 

because this is all that we™ve got, and we™ll  gi ve them their

(ph), their due, 
and then we™ll Œ

when the farmers have to deliver grain, or potatoes, you know, that Œ for the arm y.

th

[indeci pher

A: Yeah, but wa Œ give them what they want, more or less, and then forget it. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: That™s how, I guess, the readers treated Œ treated those pages, al so. 

Q: But here, I Œ when you talk about that, here is another effect, and that is, perhaps, 
the price one pa ys. I m ean, there have been a l ot of artistic works, whether the y™ve

been in film, or in books, that have talked about, what does it mean to one™s sense of 
artistic integrity, and also human moral integrity, when you decide to play with t he 

bad guys, whoever they are.
 
A: Yeah, but there are Œ there were an Œ I know, during that peri od there were at 

least five poets, and five prose writ ers, who already had the Œ I thi nk they Œ 
they go
t 
involved by mistake, b
ecause
 they Œ their first interest in the 
Soviet Union
 began 
before the Soviets came. So they did not even knew Œ know what™s happening there. 
The y were sort of misl ed. But the y were caught, and they Œ they Œ they still believed.

A: The Œ

A: But the Soviet s, they had to control the culture too, and immediat el y.

I™m

 Œ 

A: Œ wrote a long
 
poem for

.  
Q: And tell us the essence of what that poem was. 

A: I don™t remember. I read it, and I forgot it. I read it because I respect her as a poet, 

but what Œ we were all, you know, could not believe that she did Œ wrote the poem. 
Q: It was about sta Œ 
Stalin 
brings the sun.  

A: How great Œ of course, it™s a poem, it™s happening, kind of 
a

confusion there.

that can appear. I mean, what your Œ what I see in your descriptions of how the 
regional press worked, how the Œ i s that it ™s an attempt to bring some non-

propaganda material into the publ ic sphere. Yet now, when I read, let™s say, or 

glance at papers from the ti me, they look particularly dangerous, because the non-

propaganda sections could legiti mize the propaganda sections. Do you see what I™m 
trying to say? 
A: No, but we did not see it that way.  

Q: No, you didn™t Œ 

A: We did not see i t, we did not accept it there, we did not treat it that  wa y. But we 

thought this 

 you know, t his i s that, that™s Œ you know. Who cares 

about that? But thi s is our Œ this i s our culture, this is our paper, and we don™t care 

about that. It can be disputed, and t here can be opinions, but in reality, when you are 
there, and when you reall y live in that sit uation, you try t o out Œ 
outsmart, you 
Œ  of 
course, you could not publish anyt hing. You close the theat ers, you cl Œ you do Œ 
you just give the milk, give the 

 whate
ver Germans 
ask. But that™s 

not how life goes under a Œ the occupation. People continue try to live, not to be 

disturbed by it, and try to continue their lives normally, and ignore, and sort of like 

to fight

So you 
Œ 
you

A: Because the bomb 
 
 other factories. The y could not get metal, 
they could not get t hi Œ so suddenly, from 16 hours a da y of work, or somewhere 
there, they began cutting. First they cut one hour, then another hour, and of course, 
the more hours they cut, as they were cutting down, our Œ our spirits got Œ went the 
same spee
d up. We knewthato
h, t he y™re running out of stuff. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But, well, that was not much better than the work, because you sti ll had to be 

there, and many hours, and Œ and since there was no more material s to really do the 

work on those pieces, t hey Œ we had like t o keep cleaning. Keep cleaning and 
cleaning, and like i-it was, we came so bor Œ to work, you will work, you do, 
automatically you begi n to forget even that  you are worki ng. You begin to dream, 
and your future fa Œ fantasies. But when you just cleaning and cleani ng, the boredom 

of it is Œ is Œ is Œ is suffering. 
Q: Oka y. And so Œ 

A: So eventually Œ and that™s when we concoct ed a Œ when it was reduced to like 

five or six hours of actual work, and the rest was cleaning, we thought, with

could Œ oriental languages and phi losophies and Œ and he spoke t hem all, and he was 

in music. We learned really a lot from hi m. So for some ti me the y put him int o our 

barracks, also. And it™s from him Œ and he was very close t o

Schleswig-Holstein

Kreg

 knew him, and the Œ a-a-and he was ver Œ

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

215
 
A: Œ 
because he was a medical 
Œ you know, he had just graduated. So he ended up 
here in Œ in 
Schleswig-Holstein
, i n Œ in Œ in that area. But before he l eft, he said, if 
one day you want t o try to Œ to Œ to Œ if you think it™s realistic to run to 
Sweden
 to 

escape, I wil l give you some leads. He Œ he knew beca Œ f
rom 
Riga
, during his 
studies, he had made contacts wit h Œ with 
Sweden
. So, but he said Œ but first if Œ 
before you go, go t o 
 
 and we Œ and Œ and s-see me, and I will give you 
then the last, latest contacts to the boats that could take you to 
Sweden
 from schwa Œ

Q:

Q: 
Kiel
?  
A: 
Denmark
. 
Q: In 
Denmark
. Oh, okay. 
A: No. So, we Œ we tal ked. Somehow when the Œ the hours became shorter, we 

thought, why don™t we tell brothers 
Neunert
 that since there is no work here, you 

know, we could Œ maybe we™re willing to go t o Œ to Œ to Œ they could send us to 

Kiel
. 
Q: Oka y.

July 1, 2018 
 
 
 
216
 
A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that 
Kiel
 was bombed almost every day, 
every night. So somehow, I Œ he did not know what to do with the workers. 

Q: Because they™re all cleaning, they have nothing else to do. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: So, I think the idea came first Œ we overheard from him, that he was with his 
brother, he had a brother who was a very, actuall y nice supervisor there. He used to 

be a teacher, and when the war started, the y put hi m in the factory. So, he never 

liked, he was o Œ and he, that helped me Œ you see, I had the machi ne, I was working 

with the machine. I all Œ alwa ys had little pieces of paper with German let Œ wit h 

German words. I was studying there, m y language. So he used to come to me li ke a 

teacher, and then exam ine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out Œ 
out what do do with the workers, and that™s when we dropped this 
Kiel
 idea. So said, 
oh, yes, I t hink we Œ we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because 

there they st ill have materials. 

Q: How did you know that 
Kiel 
was being bombed? 

A: It was not very far from us. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: All the workers knew, everybody was, don™t go there, don™t go there.

 call us in, said Œ 
and givepapers to 
us which tell Œ it™s clearly written that we are Œ that please permit to travel there, and 

that we™re going, it sa y, to 
Kiel
, to that Œ t o a factory so and so, and Œ and Œ and 

that™s it. So we sai d okay, we go. But on our way, as we Œ where we crossed the riv Œ 

river, we got rid of our documents, and we continued to 

.  
Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: Naïvely thinking that, you know, we can very easily Œ but before that, we 
continued to 

, and from there to Œ we walked t o 
Husum
.  
Q: 
Husum
, okay. 

A: Where 

 l ived. 
Q: Lived, oka y. 

A: And he gave us some informati on where we Œ whom to meet on the other side of 

the border. So we go back to 

, we board the train to cross Œ  that was going 
towards 
Denmark
. But  just before we boarded the train, and the police comes and 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

asks for our papers. So we had the basic papers fro Œ that Germans had given to all 
their workers. So t hat it Œ identification was there, but the fact that wet Œ we™re 

supposed to report to
 K iel
, that was not there. They Œ that did not know. So, is i t Œ 

no, you cannot Œ you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we Œ 
we 

walk around, and we took our ti me, we walk around, and we Œ we go into like t wo or 
three wagons, la Œ 
and we 
Œ and we Œ we walked there around, and we Œ we Œ we 
sort of jumped int o Œ on a train that was already like moving out. But it Œ like in 15 
minutes we realized that it was not going to 
Denmark
, it  was going back to Œ to 

Schleswig
, or Œ or anot her town, back to where you Œ 
we came from.
 
Q: Somepl ace in Œ in 
Schleswig

A: Yes. But then we Œ we also not iced that  this Œ every st ation, every train was full 

of German refugees, that there was Œ it was already Œ 
there wereso many Germans 
running from the eastern parts, that  already like was beginning of the chaos there. So 
we said, why don™t  we mi x up wit h them? 

Q: And di d you?  

A: And that™s what  we did. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: This is all like t aking chances, but it was easy to take t hose chances, because we 

noticed that  even the police could not cont rol any more.

Russia
 
stillis my home. SoI

don™t we go tra Œ somehow, to the south, to the American zone. So we were Œ bought 
bikes, and we again Œ because the y said, you cannot go, t here are no Œ there are no 
bridges, no Œ 
how can yo
u go, even with a bike? So we managed to reach on bikes, 

, which is like 30 miles or so, t hrough the center Œ  
Q: Not exactly the south of 
Germany
. 
A: And then Œ then we got rid wit h Œ we cannot go any further on ba Œ our bikes. So 

we sta yed in 

rg
 for ma ybe a month or so, and then Œ then we had enough of 

 all Œ because there was nothing left of the city, you know. So we just 
decided to go on the train and try t o go to Œ to Œ to the south, as far as we can. 

Q: Did you have anyt hing like mon
e y?
 
A: We had some money, and the mone y was Œ and this remained so for al most until

one more ch-
chance. We knowt hatthere is wa 
Œ somebody sai d, yeah, but

Every train was cra Œ st a Œ there was nobody sitting, there was only standing. And no 

eating, no water, no sleep. So we Œ

want to go back east. But where did you Œ 

A: Wedid not 
Œ se Œ th-the Œ the Œ the wa y they were dispersed, was that first Œ 
these came from camps, were in Œ belong Œ  controlled like this Œ the refugee Œ 
United Nati ons Refugee Organizati on. 
Q: 
UNRRA
. 
A: It™s Œ 
we were 
a part  of it. So
 UNRRA 
used to check wi th the Œ 
Cana da
,
 
Australia
, very well, what kind of Œ how many refugees can you take, and what kind 

of professions you need? So, there were Œ used to be signs in the morning on the 

board, for everybody to see, 
Ca nada
 needs for Œ 
Canada 
needs 200 woodworkers.
 
So every Œ you know, all the strong Œ might be healthy, strong people. So Œ so that 
was the procedure, how Œ how t he y Œ they Œ 
by professions. 
So everybody was 
tryi ng, or in 

 or Œ or Œ or t he y were courses given to be Œ t
each you 
in three days, how Œ the wa y become this or t hat, or that profession
al
. And I have Œ I

Interview with Jonas Mekas 
July 1, 2018 
 
 
 
233
 
A: Yeah. So, that™s how Œ where this prac Œ and then at some point, we Œ we did not 
go Œ want to go to the woods, because we were not the types. So Œ 

Q: What do you mean by you didn™t want to go to the woods? 

A: We had other dreams. For instance, we Œ we want Œ 

Q: Ah, you didn™t want  to be a woodcutter Œ 
excuse me.
 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. Al l right. 

A: We had a dream already, somewhere around, at that ti me, the first dream was to 

go to 
Israel
 and start a movie industry. 

Q: And why 
Israel
? 

A: Because we were already getting interested in film. 

 go to 
America
, and we Œ we cannot get t o 
Hollywood
. But here Œ here it j ust country, just 
coming int o existence, there™s nothing there. Says, why don™t we go to 
Israel
, and 
we didn™t, you know, we can start m
aybe do something tostartfil m

Israel 
is Œ 
A: I have to look up, it™s in m y diary. It™s in my book. 

Q: Oh. The reason why I ask is that before 1948, it would have been t he British, and 

then after 1948, 
Israel
 was already independent. 

A: Yeah Œ no, it was already independent. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s why we wanted to go. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: This was going to help the new country, see? 

Q: Oka y.

dreams. We don™tte
ll t hat we want Œ 
want to goto 
Israel
. We don™t know their 
relation. So they look up, they Œ 
they 
Œ 
the y look 
Œ they Œ they treat us already, 
seriously, says, yeah, we™ll see. And then the secretary, the person in charge comes 
back, says, oh, why didn™t you come yesterday? There were three places left, and 

they were Œ and the y were taken by your ot her friends, Lithuanians. So, back we go.

Interview with Jonas Mekas

A: And that™s when I Œ 
at
 
Chicago  
 
 
Lithuanian community began 
calling me a communist. 
Q: You never know how an Œ 
avant
-garde can become controversi al. I want to go 
back to another point, and I want you to describe for me, if you can Œ 
people, you 
know, have i
mages that  
Œ of a group, and sometimes the y get reduced to stereotypes, 
and sometimes those stereotypes happen to have truth to them, you know? 

A:Yes, yes, yes.
 

Q: And one image that stays in my mind is what a Œ what you had sai d earlier, 

during the first part  of our interview, when we talked, and I asked, di d you know of 

anybody who had parti cipated in crimes against the Jews, who ha Œ could have been 

Œ 

A: No, I can tell you ri ght now.  
Q: You didn™t. 
A: No. 

Q: You di dn™t. 

A: No. But from 
Michael Œ 
Michael
 Œ 
Michael 
Œ 
his last name always falls Œ has 
written 
to me,has said
 that some of the people that I knew had practiced 


. Like the po Œ and in which way? Not i n cri mes, in the Œ that t he 

poet 
Matuzevicius
(ph) , who had Œ was in the Œ from gymnasium 
Bir
, two or 
three years earlier 
than me
, and some of his friends Œ and so I understood from 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
July 1, 2018 
 
 
 
249
 
Michael
 that he has Œ t hat he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the 
shooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home 
Œ their home belongings 

 
Q: Oka y, t heir Œ their items, their assets, yeah. 

A: Their assets. So that  is the Œ so I Œ I kn
ew, and 
Œ and actually admired li Œ like the 
Œ like the 
younger, budding, you know,poets cal 
Œ you know, want t o be published, 
and want to be know Œ every young poet wants the Œ and has it Œ some people, close, 

that he Œ older poet s that he or she admires. At that time 
Matuzevic
ius
(ph) was the 
poet of 

. He was the young, l ike 
 
. An
d he was 
good, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to 


, etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who Œ who 
were writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was Œ when I heard this from 
Michael
, t o me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of ‚
the six.
™ He said Œ 
so, in those six Œ and he wrote a poem about six with Œ which was pub-published in 

, at Œ I don™t know what Œ what Œ what month. And ‚the six™ 
became 

like heroes. People did not know t hat such Œ that they existed, when Œ and the y 

found out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of 

them later, I Œ I Œ I don™t know, but I think they were instrumental  to Œ to star Œ help 

others to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like Œ like those 
six who worked against the Soviets. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
July 1, 2018 
 
 
 
250
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Now, I thought  it was Œ when I read it, I thought I Œ 
I als
-also like admired that 

they did it, but I al so thought, why is he publishing this? Though the y Œ he did not 

name the names. The poem does not name names. But I thought Œ I didn™t know Œ of 

course, already, you see, I was in Œ connected to the underground, m y own Œ 
Q: So Œ 
A: Œ by di stributi ng leaflets, that is why. And then, this was already under Germans. 

And then, somehow it was clear that this was like wrong ti me to Œ to publish some Œ 

something like that. 

Q: So what you Œ if I interpret what you™re saying, is that 
Matuzevi
cius
(ph) was a 
poet you admired Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ before then, wi th t he Soviets, he works underground Œ 
A: Underground, yes. 

Q: Œ against the Soviet s, he™s one of ‚the six.™ 

A: Yes. 

Q: When the Germans come, he publishes a poem ab
out this 
Œ  
A: Six. 

Q: Œ 
underground six.
 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
July 1, 2018

Q: And you were thinking, this is not the right time to publish Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ your connecti on to ‚the six.™ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Whatever that would have been. 
A: Yes, and later on I said Œ it was alwa ys what Œ 
why 
Œ why did he did that? 
Q: And the next ti me is when 
Michael Casper
, who has written the ﬁ
New York 
Review of Books
,ﬂ arti cle, mentions to you, shows you that he had confessed un Œ in 

a Soviet trial. 

A: Yeah, but you see, t hat Œ whatever is confessed to the Soviets, I never take it for 

real money.
 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Oka y. But I started this questioning for a different question. And t hat was about Œ 

A: But I ended Œ your Œ your question ended up very si mple, in three or four word, 
do I know anybody who killed, or committed criminal act s against  Œ 

Q: I didn™t finish t he question, though. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Well, and I said Œ 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas 
July 1, 2018 
 
 
 
252
 
Q: No. 
A: No, I di d not 
know, cause 
Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: But the Œ what I wanted to say with that, is that when you answered this in part 

one of our interview, you said that , but in the 
DP
 camps Œ  
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ you had met some people who very Œ you could Œ  
A: Whom I believed could have been. 

Q: Were capable of it. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Were capable of it. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And Œ and so there™s an Œ 
A: No, there i Œ was another Œ this was in 

Œ 
in 

, when I was 
still in 

. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Because that™s where the la-last resistance against, I guess the divi sions, German 

divisions t hat fought English arm y Œ the army came from 
Denmark
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: So that™s where the y ended up, and th-that™s where the y were released, including 
those Lithuanians. And Œ and there was thi s Li thuanian general, very educated, very 

 
Interview with Jonas Mekas

253
 
educated person,
 Daukantas
. 
Dauka nta s
. Whom I had never heard about, but I met 
hi m there, i n the camp, though he Œ Germans did that, put Œ if one Œ i f a Lithuanian 
was a general of that st ature, ger Œ Germans, even if that Lithuanian or any other Œ 
from any ot her country, was of that military stature, Germans respect ed Œ had so 

much admiration for the arm y, they used t o give them special, indivi dual apart ments. 
But English did the same. The y gave to 
Daukantas
 
a 
Œ 
a 
room. It™s this Œ I ra Œ and I 
met  hi m, and because some of those young arm y Lithuanians from the German 
arm y, crimi nals, I Œ reall y, the y were crimi nals, introduced me to hi m, because they 

admired, because he was a general. So Œ  

Q: Does he figure in this story? Does he Œ was he one of those that you would have 

had this Œ 

A: No, no.  
Q: No. 
A: No, no, not 
dauka n 
Œ
 no, not the general. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No, he was Œ 
again, he
 wa Œ we Œ we remained friends from us Œ during our stay 

in wen Œ in Œ in Œ in 
 
, because he was also very much in Oriental 
m ysticism, the general. And he used asked me to come and talk to hi m Œ  
Q: About i t. 
A: Œ a-about it. He sa ys, I have nobody to Œ here to talk about it. So Œ

Q: But it was these Œ you Œ 
these were 
Œ  
A: And about hi m, and some of these meetings, I am writi ng Œ you wi ll find in the 
Lithuanian version ofm y ﬁ
I Had Nowhere To Go
.ﬂ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I eli minated it from the English because it was of no interest, like in the Œ not the 
Œ 
Q: Well, that Œ I mean, we™re going on many topics, but let™s finish this one, just  for 

a second Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ because I think it™s rather short. Is it Œ  

A: But those fi Œ 
reme 
Œ those young, cri minal  types from the arm y, j ust released Œ  
Q: German army. 
A: Œ from the German army, some of them, they were drafted, and we came like t hat 
in the army, those ca Œ 
the arm y can, as 
Œ 
as 
you know from 
Vietnam
, 
can change 
one into cri
minal. S
ome ma y have even volunteered, who knows? When the y were 
all released, the y were ready to Œ to Œ to Œ to kill, to steal, to cont inue their cri minal 

activities. 

Q: And so, were the y st ill spewing a kind of anti-
Semitic hate 
Œ  
A: No, no, no, no, the y did not tal k about the Jews, or anti-Semiti c. This i Œ this is

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ that cri minals of that kind of personalities, of that kind of criminal personalities, 

are

Q: I see. 

A: I can™t sort of assume. 
Q: I see. 
A: I-If the very Œ and now we know there were some, you know Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ Lithuanians who co-op Œ who collaborated, and were killers, it™s that type Œ 

Q: Of person. 

A: Œ particularly Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ in every country. That doesn™t mean that it throws bad light  on 
Lithuania
. It™s 
just that category, that segment of populat ion, you find in every ci ty, every village, 
every 
Œ 

Q: Yeah. My quest ion was really geared to 
DPs
. So, I wanted to kind of see if 
there™s a characteristic of 
DPs
.And you have explainedt o me 
that that charact Œ t hat 
what you described about being i n

A: I did not hear abou
t it.
 

Q: Yes. I understand now. 
A: I assume it. 
Q: I assume. But i t™s al so not really about the 
DPs

about young Lithuanians who had been in the German arm y. And then Œ 

A: But 
 
 people Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ 
any coun
try, in Œ in Œ in general, that t here are Œ there i s a sick segment that  is 
cri minal. 
Q: Do you think amongst the Œ yes. Do you t hink that amongst the 
DPs
, you heard 
any such sentiments? You know, when they came from 
Lithuania
? 
A: Senti ments? 
Q: Senti ments about Œ t hat had been very popular in 
Lithuania
 for a t ime, for Œ that 

Jews are responsibl e for our misfortune, t he Jews helped the Soviets. You know, this 

sort of Œ 

A: Only Œ the only thing that I heard was agai n not in the camps, but when in

who that some of them were accusing Jews for th Œ

working with the Œ bringing Œ helping Œ bringi ng in Œ int o 
Lithuania
 
as
 
communism, the Soviets. 
Q: Oka y. Okay. 

A: No, because the Œ the farmers, they were much working with the Jews. The Œ the 

Œ the all Œ in 
Bir
, in 
Papilys
, we depended on them. And I know from our 
neighbor, from my mot her, fro Œ the y were very 
 
 you know, like 
part of the family. It was not so Œ and that kind of the communist rumor, I did not 

hear from my farmers, actually, I heard that when I went beg Œ in the fall, when I 

went to the Œ to th Œ already back to the studies, in 

.  
Q: Yeah. I t hink that Œ 

A: And farmers were very open in Œ in the Œ at least northern 
Lithuania
 to the Œ and 
there were Jews in every smaller town. And that™s why, you know, when Œ when 

 all 5,000 people in 

, and then I hear from 
Michael
 that t here 
were 2,200.  
Q: Four hundred. 

A: How could it be? Not half of the city I haven™t seen 

 hundred. 
But in the Œ 
they we
re brought from those other little town, that are smal ler, like Œ 

like 
Papilys
, and Œ and they were, you know, someti mes ma ybe i t™s three families. 

But somet i mes, in some of those small Œ smaller towns, ma ybe there were 100. 
Because how else can you make up 2,200?

there are all kinds of busi ness sharks in
