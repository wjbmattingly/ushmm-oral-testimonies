A: No, but they were -- some body told me  
in Israel that th
ere™s a Rabbi Herzog, 
comes fr om the same town that my mo
ther originally comes from, Radautz, 
Romania.  There may be something ther
e, I don™t know.  I never pursued it. 
There™s no one to ask anymore. 
 

Q: Right.  You me ntioned that 
your father had four stores? 

 

A: He had two ma nufacturings of berets 
in two prisons, one was in Seerbu and the 
other one wa s in Berzowa. 
 

Q: So prisoners actually 
produced these berets? 

 

A: Yeah.  The berets, they were -- I me an 
-- the schoolgirls used 
to -- not the Jewish 
ones because .  Before the war, I guess the beret with the number here and then 

that what he ma nufactured, just the bere
ts.  He imported linge
ri e and st uff fro m 
Germany be fore the war.  He was 18 years old. 
 

Q: How old wa s he when he started his fa mily? 

 

A: He started his fa mily -- my
 parents were ma rried in 1926. 
 

Q: Were you a religious family? 

 

A: Very traditional, yes. 
 
Q: You observed the Sabbath and --? 

 

A: Kashrut.  And my father was a big soccer fan.  They won this thing with 
Macabee.  In fact I reme mber every seas
on, all the players that came in, who were 
invited for lunch in my house.  Because he
 didn™t have a son, only two girls, he 
used to drag us every Sunday to the so
ccer game.  That would bother the hell out 
of me . 
 

Q: These were the Jewish soccer leagues that pl ayed? 

 

A: And the non-Jewish.  I think they we re
 all Jewish.  From
 Poland, the soccer 
players came, from all over.  He
 was a very avid, ardent fan. 
 

Q: He didn™t play, just as a fan? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did your mo ther work in the house? 

 

  
 
3
A: Yeah.  Legal secretary as a young girl. 
 

Q: She was?   Di d you live in a home or an apartment? 

 

A: In an apartment. 

 

Q: What do you reme mber about that 
apartment?   About the size or --? 
 

A: Being afraid.  Not very large.  Ther
e was a living room and dining room.  There 
was a large kitchen.  We  had a ma id in 
the little, olden days
, who slept in the 
kitchen on a cot.  Separated like this a
nd there was a large bedroom and the living 
room had a sleep couch, some thing like th
at.  That was in Czernowitz.  Then my 
father bought, built an apartment, boughtit.  We  never took possession of that 

because we fled.  I mean everythi ng star
ted to happen.  Nothing came  of t hat. 
 

Q: So he eventually bought the building? 

 

A: No, in a different location.  But we never 
did get to live ther e.  When we started to 
furnish and they were finishing it
, we were not allowed any more. 
 

Q: What kind of schools did you attend? 

 

A: I went to a kindergarten, there was a 
Roma nian school.  It was, you know, not a 
Jewish school.  Then I started primary grades there. 
 

Q: Also the Roma nian schools? 
 
A: Yes.  Herescu School was the 
name  of it.  H-e-r-e-s-c-u. 
 

Q: Did you also go to Cheder? 

 

A: No, we had private teacher at home. 
 It was hard because like I said, the 
Roma nians were not big fans of the Jewi
sh people and so there were no Jewish 
teachers per se.  Especially for girls, but
 we had a teacher come to the house , to 
teach us.  A Jewish teache r, name d Mr. 
Clipper.  He always had an onion and 
some  bread in his pocket and when we di
dn™t read it right, he™d
 hit us with the 
ruler. 
 

Q: Oh, really?  And the onion and br
ead was just for him to mu nch on? 
 

A: Right.  That was standard 
equipment for Hebrew teachers. 

 

Q: He taught you just Hebrew or 
also Jewish history or studies? 
 

A: Both. 

 

  
 
4
Q: How ma ny days a week w
ould he come  to your house? 
 
A: In the beginning, twice a week.  But th
en when things got bad and we couldn™t go 
out or to school for that ma tter, he ca
me  every day.  Then in the morning and 
there was a group of us, children who didn™
t have to go on the street.  You know, 
they were skipping on the fences to co
me .  He would teach us Hebrew and 
Judaism and his daughter would give us cl
asses so that we could -- we were not 

allowed to go to school. Math and geogr
aphy and Latin, oh God, I had 12 years of 

Latin. 
 

Q: What do you reme mber about any favor
ite subjects you had in public school? 
 

A: Mostly recess.  I don™t know.  Not rea
lly.  I liked history 
and I liked geography 
and I hated math. 
 

Q: Do you remember any incidents of anti-Semitism from the other children, the 
Romanian children? 
 

A: Oh, yes.  We used to come  home from
 school when we were little.  My mother 
came -- brought us and then picked us up. Afterwards we™d come  home  on our 

own.  We  were beaten up every time  
we came home .  We wer e  beaten by the 
Christian boys who came from school at th
e same  time.  Used to throw stones and 
I reme mber I had a friend who was the prie
st™s daughter that liv
ed next door.  She 
used to go with me  and sort of like try 
to protect me and chase them away.  But 
yes, there was spitting and 
stone-throwing and ﬁdirty Je
wﬂ and that kind of thing, 
that was the order of the day. 
 
Q: You lived in an integrated neighborhood? 
 

A: Yes.  We  had the Greek Orthodox Church, the prominent religion in Romania was 
Greek Orthodox.  The church was right acros
s the street from us and the priest™s 
daughter was a very good friend of mi ne.  We
 played together in her house, in my 
house.  He was very kind because when they came  to take us away, ma ny a time 

he would shield us.  I reme mber the da
ughter™s name  but I cannot reme mber his 
last name .  Irina was her name . 
 

Q: What was it? 

 

A: Irina.I-r-i-n- a. 

 

Q: That™s a very Romanian name. 

 

A: Well, it™s Ir ene actually. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

  
 
5
A: Irina.  And then we were not allowed to go to school any more, you know, the 
Germans ---  So we didn™t--we had these lessons at  home. 
 
Q: Do you remember what year that wa
s?   Or how old you were when you stopped 
going to school? 
 

A: I guess eight, I™m not sure.  I have such
 a mi xture in my head of Bucharest, 
Romania and ---Cuba. 
 

Q: Right.  I can check it. 

 

A: Czernowitz and Cuba.  Anyway, 
I must have been eight or so. 
 

Q: What do you reme mber about -- did some body give you a reason why you 
weren™t going to school 
any more, do you recall? 
 

A: Yes, because  we were Je ws.  Wa it a mi nut
e.  I di d one year of what they called 
lyceum a high school, one year. 
 

Q: Gy mnasiu m? 

 

A: Gymnasium.  One year and it was a Je
wish school.  It was Hoffman, Hoffma n 
Lyceum.  I don™t know if I finished the 
year or not.  In Czernowitz.  I don™t 

reme mber if I finished the year or not. 
 I know that because I had a number here 
and I had a beret with a number here. 
 
Q: I see.  So that wa
s a private Jewish school? 
 
A: Yeah.  Hoffman, it™s called.  I don™t know if
 I finished the year or I didn™t finish 
the year.  I don™t know that.  But that™s a
bout it.  The rest I took -- we were being 
taught.  Every neighborhood tried to have 
some body nearby that could go without 
going out on the street.  So that™s how we
 learned and we came  a fter the war in 
Bucharest.  I was, I did an exam.  I was admitted into high school.  It was really 

individual teaching and she was very 
dedicated, this woma n.  She was the 
daughter of ---. 
 

Q: This was Mr. Clipper™s daughter? 

 

A: Right.  And she was very dedicated and sh
e was determined to teach, for us not to 
be without schooling.  We did that.  I didn™
t like it but we did 
it.  But then there 
was nothing else to do.  Because we coul
dn™t go on the street anyway so we did 
that. 
 

Q: Were you a well-to-do family before the war? 

 

  
 
6
A: I would say yes, I would say yes.  So 
ma ny standards of well to do.  We  were very 
comfortable, let™s put it this way. 
 
Q: Would you take trips at all 
inthe summer months or --? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  We used to go to --. 

 

Q: Carpathians?  

 

A: Yes.  We  used to go to --.  First of all,
 as little children we went to a pl ace called 
Ki mpolung which was in the Bukovina.  Then later on we became more 

sophisticated.  That was from Bucha r es
t. Czernowitz, we went to Kimpolung 
which was in the mountains.  We  had sort of like an efficiency and my pa rents 

went for bath.  My father came on the weekends, some thing like that. 
 

Q: A spa of some  kind or --? 

 

A: I don™t know, yeah, mo re or less, yeah.  
My mot her went for this bath.  Once she 
took us to -- I was very little.  She took
 me  to Czechoslovaki a, to Prague.  What 
was the name of it?  Some resort, I hated 
it.  I cried because I couldn™t take  those -
- the smell.  She took me  with her into th
is, like a spa.  They were taking these 

mud baths and the mud things -- I hated it. 
 I only got to go once.  After that we 
went to Kimpolung, you know, a lot of people 
were there.  We had a river, in 
German it™s called the Prut River, we used
 to go every day there.  In the summer, 
whenever there were no threat of pogrom
s.  Ever y -- I reme mber distinctly, I 
don™t know with what, whether there was 
a real schedule, every two months, 
every three months, but I know
 that every once in awhile, when the rumor came  
out, we had to go in hiding.  Th
at was before anything else. 
 

Q: You™d pretty much lock yourse
lf in the apartment and ---? 
 

A: No, no, no.  We went -- this guy hid us. 

 

Q: I see.  And the pogroms were commi tted by Romanians? 

 

A: Roma nians, Ukrainians, the Cossack group.  I am ______. 

 

Q: Would they go as fa r as to kill Je ws? 

 

A: Oh, sure.  They would go so far as to ta
ke a rabbi and take hair by hair, pull his ---
.  That™s what happened to Rabbi Mark, Cherna™s rabbi, temple.  It was the 

Germans aft e rwards.  First thing they did. 
 It was a plaza like; it was a bi g temple.  
It was an orthodox; we didn™t know anything 
about conservative or reform then.  
So the women™s balcony was up there and 
the me n were down there.  It wa s a 
very beautiful plaza and they
 went in and they made all the Jews dig a grave.  

  
 
7
They took Rabbi Mark and they absolutely
 tortured him, shot him that he fell 
inside the grave, inside that pit.. 
 
Q: In the pl aza, this was? 

 

A: Yes.  The Germans did that and a fe
w other people from the synagogue.  Then 
they liked the way that this came out so they went from house  to house.  I 

reme mber on four occasions, my father
 was already standi ng, was all the me n 
together.  Some thing always happened 
and I cannot give you an explanation.  
Some how, t hat they were saved.  Either some body called them away or 

some thing, I don™t know what it was but 
it was dug.  The hole was dug in our 
garden and my father was standing around.  
My mother and my sister was sitting 
there, you know, from t he window.  Only the men.  Some thing happened, either 

with the war, I don™t remember what 
it was but some how he was saved.  His 
father died like this too.  
So error and fear is what I grew up with.  Possibly I can™t 
reme mber because of that; I thought I pushed 
it out of my life.  There were better 
times when we came to Bucharest.  As I said before, my mot her -- my father -- 

my relatives actually in Bucharest decided th
at --  little by little 
to bring us out of 
there.  Because Czernowitz was very ba
d.  My mother got some how a certificate 
that she needs an operation in the capitol, 
in Bucharest.  As two mi nors, we went 
with her. 
 

Q: She didn™t need an operation, this was __? 

 

A: No. 

 
Q: Afake? 
 

A: Right.  We got there and it was great.
  We  couldn™t go out because they we re 
looking for people from Czernowitz to re-d
eport them.  So we were hidden for a 
good three months in some body™s house until
 that thing blew away, whatever it 

was.  It took my father seven months to walk from town to town; from the 

northern Roma nia into the capitol, Bucharest.  He arrived almost before the 

Germans started to bomb.  That™s how we 
were reunited and we had four years of 
constant  bombardment in Bucharest. 
 

Q: InBucharest? 

 

A: Yeah.  So we were going constantly --.
  There was a big, big building.  One of the 
biggest, where my aunt and uncle lived 
and we were with them.  I don™t know 
which bomb was it, the British or  the Amer
ican took two stor ies off that.  We  
were under -- well they were building, the 
building was already done with, what is 
it called? not for bomb, for shelter, was an
 air raid shelter down there.  We 
practically lived ther
e because it was -- in the morni
ng, the British, then the silver, 
the Americans came; then the Russians.  So we were back and forth, back and 

forth.  At least they didn™t have time  for 
the Jews.  A lot of people were killed in 

  
 
8
shelters because the bombing it had to be. 
 It was such a mi xed feeling.  We knew 
the bombs, they comi ng to bomb; but we were happy they were comi ng.  So a lot 
of people perished in the -- 
Jews and non-Jews, I imagine. 
 

Q: So those four years, you pretty much 
stayed in your aunt and uncle™s home and 
didn™t venture out much? 
 

A: Yes, yes, uh-huh.  No, I reme mber going to, on the corner there was a movie, 
Ingrid Bergman and -- what was the movie?
  I just saw it on televi sion recently -- 
I never saw the end of that movie until we 
got to It aly.  It was -- the bombs were 

comi ng so I didn™t see that movie. 
 

Q: I see.  So you were at th
e movies and you had to leave? 
 

A: Intermezzo.  Well the alarm was sounding. 
 There was pre-alar
m that went when 
they left Italy.  The pre-alarm they had 
to evacuate the movie imme diately.  So we 
had only about a block to go.  My sister 
and I never saw the end of it until we got 
to, I think, America or Cuba, the end of the movie, Intermezzo.  Then we did our -

- after that we did our equi
valency, we went to school. 
 

Q: InBucharest? 

 

A: Bucharest. 

 

Q: In Bucharest.  What kind of school 
did you go to?  When did you start going back 
to school? 
 

A: After I -- they hold an exam for those, 
the equivalency.  I was taught at home ; so 
were ma ny others.  We  went into junior
 high school.  The junior high school and 
high school and I got my baccalaureate.  What
 is it called?   Finish of high school, 
the big exam.  There was an oral exam and a wr itten exam.  The oral exam -- they 

were communists, of course, and you coul
dn™t say anything about ---.  You had to 
say, you had to lie.  They twisted histor
y a lot and you had to go along with that, 
otherwise they failed you.  
And it was a very tough exam, a whole day exam.  I 
reme mber my mother fasting on that day 
because we knew we were tryi ng to get 
out and she wanted me  to have that docum
ent with me.  I passed it and then there 
was years until we got the visa for, the transit vi sa  for Hungary and Austria but 

the exit visa  expired.  So we went fo
r two years until fi nally it happened.  We 
took a lot of our stuff, like some  china and 
some  crystal thatwere
 in the family for 
a long, long time and we shipped it to Israel
 to my aunt.  That™s how come  I have 
these -- whatever pi ctur es I have.  Because
 when we left Bucharest, we were told 
that you™ll come  crawling b
ack and you don™t even need anything to take with 
you.  They examined my  teeth and the ha
ir for diamonds and for whatever.  My 
father buried a lot of stuff.  They now ha
ve a refrigerator  factory there so there™s 
no chance of going to get that.  We  came out
 and went to Switzerland first and my 
father got some  money out from wha t  he 
had long before the war.  If we didn™t 

  
 
9
have that money, we could never have ma
de it.  We bought some  clothes and we 
tried to go to consulates, to get a visa
.  Switzerland only gave you so mu ch stay 
and you couldn™t stay any longer and they 
would not prolong it.  So we came  to 

Italy.  In Italy we went to the American embassy and they informed us that we 

can™t get a visa.  We  lived in Italy for eight months. 
 

Q: Where in Italy?  

 

A: In Milano.  We traveled 
through a lot of this -- whenever an embassy was . There 
was a question of Costa Rica or Cuba or Venezuela or whatever.  My father, deep 

inside him, was hoping that the Russians w
ould go away and he would be able to 
go back. 
 

Q: ToCzernowitz? 

 

A: No, to Bucharest.  Czernowitz is gone. 
 Wa s given away.  He never told us when 
there was a boat.  Finally we got a visa to
 Cuba.  According to my father™s cousin 
in America; he said that™s the closest,
 forty mi nutes.  So you wait a couple of 
weeks and then you™ll come  here.  A c ouple of weeks turned out to be ---. 
 

Q: It was 40 mi nutes between Cuba and the U.S., right? 

 

A: So we chose Cuba.  We  went to the C
uban emba ssy in Italy and we got our visa.  
Then he was holding off.  Every time we 
go to check when there™s a boat to Cuba, 
he said, there™s no boat to Cuba.  He t
hought ma ybe they™ll go away, ma ybe we™ll 
be able ---.  He just ---.  We wanted to
 go to Israel  and we were advise d not to.  
We went through a lot so much already a
nd I mean, ™48; the State was born in 
™48.  This was ™47 and there was a lot of
 things going on there and so finally, he 
couldn™t hold anymore and we took a boat. 
 We  went to Cuba. We  had falsified 
papers in Italy, I want you to know, 
from the Romanian government Œin-exile 
because we only had a vi sa for 30 days a
nd it came , what, eight months we stayed 
there.  So they kept falsified on our pass
port, that we have.  
We got a Cuban visa 
and a false Roma nian visa.  Even the la
nguage was not correct because they were 
a governme nt-in-exile.  They forgot
 how to speak Roma nian from King 
Michael™s.  So we got our Cuban visa and 
we came  to Cuba.  We  stayed in Cuba 
and waited and waited. 
 
Q: The entire time, trying to leave Cuba? 

 

A: Yes.  Right.  No, we didn™t.  We  coul
dn™t get a visa.  My father was -- how can 
you sit in a hotel.  How long can you --?   My
 father went into business.  We had 
an apartment.  I was working, my sister
 was working.  I went to business school 

and learned steno and I was a 
secretary in six languages. 
 

Q: You™re living in Havana? 

 

  
 
10
A: In Havana, yes.  And so is my sister, import/export companies.  We  were very 
happy.  My parents suffered and they, I m
ean it was hot.  The hurricanes, they™re -
- besides when an American visa come s. We go. 
 
Q: What year did you go to Cuba, 
what year did you leave Europe? 
 

A: Left Europe in ™47. 

 

Q: Do you remember the exact date? 

 

A: No, I reme mber we got --Œ no, I don™t reme
mber the exact date.  We  got to Cuba 
in 1948, the hottest year, the hottest su
mmer, well, it was all year around.  The 
biggest hurricanes, that wa
s Cuba.  Then we came here to the United States and 
my father again went into a different bus
iness.  He  -- his cousin was in knitwear 
so he worked with him for a while and th
en he opened a wholesale store, down on 
Ludlow Street.  He was selling to stores
 and he was ma nufacturing himself.  In 
other words, not ma nufa c turing but cont
racting; sweaters and all kinds of 
knitwear.  Then he had a heart attack and died. 
 

Q: How old wa s he when he died? 

 

A: Fifty-eight.  My mother was 67 when she 
died five years later.
  It™s just, you know 
you go through so much and you -- she just couldn™t live without him.  Of course, 

my sister and I ---.  My sister lives in
 Florida, in Miami Beach.  She lost her 
husband. Suddenly for -- a very, very stra
nge --.  There were 14 people in cases 
like this in the world.  He was number 
15, he had cancer in his heart, can you 
imagine that?  They removed almost half 
of his heart and they replaced the wall 
with woven, imitated --.  He lived for a y
ear and a half.  I me t Charlie on a blind 

date.  Never knew what a blind date was,
 always wanted to know.  Because in 
Cuba, there were 8,000 Jews in Cuba
 and everybody knew everybody, if not 
intimately, but of everybody.  Nobody knows wh
at it means to have it like that, 
that was it.  Now are you going to behave 
Charlie or do you want me  to talk for 
you or what?   {Male voice: I™ll do my best
}.  Pull yourself together and just.  You 
ask your questions, he™ll 
answer, how™s that?
