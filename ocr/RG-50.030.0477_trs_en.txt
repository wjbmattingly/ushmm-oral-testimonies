CHARLES SIEGMAN 
 July 24, 2003 
 
Q: Welcome. 
 

A: Nice July day. 

 

Q: Indeed. Tell me  your na me .  

 

A: My for mal name  is Charles Siegma n, my 
birth name  is Charlie Sigmann, or Jechiel 
Sigmann, I was born Jechiel, the Hebrew name , 
and that itself is a in
troduction to where I 
come  from. People always ask, how does a 
good Jewish boy get the name  Charlie from 
Holland. And the story is that my father had to
 register me . In Holland, all children had to 
be registered by an official ro
ster of name s. And when my 
fat her came, he asked what™s 
child™s name, he answered Chiel, which was 
the shortened name  for Jechiel. And Chiel 
was not on the list of name s, and he had to c
hoose an official name . So the first Ch was 
Charlie. That was a Dutch name , and so my 
name became Charlie. And when I came to 
United States, they changed it to Charles, because  Charlie looked like a child name . 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But [indecipherable] re-registered or  became 
a citizen, I finally made it to Charles Jechiel 
Siegma n, so -- 
 

Q: And were you called Jechiel at home? 
 
A: Yes, Chiel, yes.  

 

Q: Chiel? 

 

A: Chiel, or Jechiel [i ndeci pherable]  

 

Q: And when were you born? 

 

A: October13
th
, 1935. 
 

Q: And you we re born where? 

 

A: In a little suburb town of The Hague cal
led Scheveningen, which was a fishing town, but 
it was a really an adjunct town of The Hague
, and eventually my 
parents moved to The 
Hague in 1940. 
 

Q: Uh-huh.

A: So -- but it was a little -- known for its fish
ing fleet, in fact, and in the wa r, the name  
Scheveningen was the shibboleth term by 
the Germans and the Dutch, because the 
Germans couldn™t pronounce the sra sound of th
e guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S-
Shravening -- Shaveningen. So when the soldie
rs who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, 
German sol diers, the early stage of the wa
r, were asked whether you™re, you know, friend 
or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, 
they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and 
they were shot. So that™s the part 
of the town, anyway, it™s a small town. 
 

Q: Sin -- since you were such a young person dur
ing this period, having been born in 1935, 
it would be good if we could try to disti
nguish between what 
you actually reme mber, 
when we talk about the experiences, and what
 you were -- what you were told, so we can 
get an idea what your memory is versus what 
you™re reme mbering from
 other people™s, if 
you think we can do that. 
 

A: Correct. Yes. Difficult to identify every -- 

 

Q: Yes, no, no, I understand, right. 

 

A: -- part of the element. This definitely is 
a blend, what I recall now, or I relate now, is a 
blend of what I recall -- 
what I think I recall -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: [indecipherable], as -- what I™ve heard, which 
I have seen confirme d, in fa ct, what I have 
-- things have re -- recors -- subsequently conf
irme d in writing, so I guess I attributed it to 
my recall as well. And what I™ve read, and h
eard, and talked with my brother and sister, 
or others. But as I™ve mentioned to you, otherw
ise, my recall is spotty, and more in the 
sense of me ntal imprints, like [indecipherable]. 
Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my 

mi nd to this day I could see certain 
pictures, and I don™
t have a running -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- [indecipherable] a comment
ary, nor the chronology thing. 
 

Q: Right.[indecipherable] 

 

A: Definitely months, or periods which I ha
ve no idea what happened when, or whether 
anything happened at all in a three month period. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But I know episodes, and episodes kind of te
ll my story in the cont
ext of the Holocaust, 
or Shoah.  
 

Q: Right. Let™s get a sense of 
your -- your fa mily before we ge
t into your particular tale. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477

A: Mm-h m.  
 

Q: Who was your dad, 
and what did he do? 
 

A: Right. My father was born in Poland, Przem
ysl, established Jewish little community, and 
he moved to western Europe, I believe firs
t to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20™s, 
before he was ma rried, in fact.[indecipherabl
e] long time settler, a
nd was another refugee 
comi ng from eastern Europe, or from Ger m
any to Holland, lived there for ma ny years. 
He was not a citizen ever, he was stateless,
 he was Polish nationality. But for Holland he 
was called stateless, but Polis
h nationality, I believe. My mother came originally from 
Zborow, which people think wer -- was Hungar
y, could be Ukraine, cause the countries 
this -- have shifted management over time, 
and was raised in Switzerland. At a very 
young age she moved to Switzerland. Her parent
s were -- grandparents, parents were one 
of the early settlers of the east European
 fa milies who moved to Zurich. Again, that  
fa mily, that group of fa milies, I was told, coul
d not move to Zurich, didn™t have the right 
to move to Zurich, they moved outside of Zuri
ch, to -- they had a lo
t of restrictions. And 
my parents were ma rried in the early 20™s -- 
in ™22, and the wedding had to be held in 
Frankfurt, because a large number of me mbers 
of the family couldn™t receive visas to go 
to Zurich, where the -- typically, the bride™
s fami ly town would be the wedding. I have 
the wedding picture of that wedding with me
, which is a nice me me nto. That also has a 
Shoah story about it in fact. But anyhow, 
my father lived in Holland, and he was a 
postage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp stor
e, had a wholesaler type of business, and 
had the store and lived origin -- he originally
 lived in Amsterdam w
ith my older brothers 
were born in Amsterdam, and then moved to 
Scheveningen, and he ha
d a store in one of 
the ma in streets. So he was a mi ddle class 
person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a 

Socialist, not a pervert, or what have you, 
and belonged to the east European community 
in Scheveningen. 
 

Q: Ca-Can you explain what it means to own a pos
tage store, that™s not  stamp collecting, or 
is it? 
 

A: Yes, stamp -- no, stamp collecting, postage stamps.  

 

Q: Ah,okay. 

 

A: Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps
 to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many 
more small stores in Europe, to this day th
ere are more than United States, who -- that 
specialized in particular items, so there -- now
, also there are fe w postage stamp stores in 
the United St ates, most probably have s -- some  Bethesda. But that was the job, to collect 

stamps from the other countri
es, and organize them by country, and know the dates, and 
the value, and they sell them to dealers, or 
to customers. So, postage stamps. He had his 

own, apparently a very personal, good postage
 stamp collection as well, which he gave 
over to some one, acquaintance or a friend, we 
don™t know exactly who, before the war. It 
never returned after the war.  
 

Q: Do you have any recollection of going into the store? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
4 
 
 
 
A: No,no. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: No, no, no, not at all, no, 
no. I -- but I do know that he dealt with postage stamps. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh 
-- but I-I see them around, I mean postage st amps 
were very popular, much more than today -- 
 

Q: So you recall in the house seeing the postage stamps? 

 

A: I saw, yes, ye s, yes. 

 

Q: And did your mother work as well? 

 

A: No, I believe she was home , as far as I reca
ll. And we -- as -- we are a family of five 
children. I wa s the youngest, born in ™35, and my
 s i ster in ™33, and my brother in ™31. 
 

Q: So ma  -- so Leah is born in ™33? 

 

A: Y-Yes, ™33 -- 

 

Q: And Leo is born -- 
 
A: -- Leo was born in ™31, and my two other br
others who were killed during the war, in 
Auschwitz, they were born in ™26, and ™24.  
 

Q: So that™s Aron -- 

 

A: Ah -- yo -- jos -- Jose f -- 

 

Q: Jos -- Josef? 

 

A: -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- 
Erik, was born in 1924. So they were 
substantially older than I 
wa-was. As a child there™s a big difference, obviously. 
 

Q: So during this period before the war, between
 --  before the war comes to the Netherlands, 
between ™35 and ™40, what is your memory of that household? 
 

A: It was a household that wa
s living, I would call mi ddle cl
ass life, going to do certain 
activities, like with fam -- family oriented ac
tivities, and Scheveninge
n wa s a resort town, 
so there were a lot of visitors, 
and to this day it™s still a reso
rt town, the beach, and -- so it 
was an active household. I don™t 
know much about the social lif
e of my fa mily, so I can™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
5 
 
 
relate to that. But so I know fr om the 
child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal 
incidents which are interesting in their own righ
t, but the fact that 
I recall them, but also 
the interesting feature 
is that both of thes
e little child events --
 childhood events where I 
was actually was saved, kind of -- 
that™s all I recall. The fi rst one was I was lost in the 
beach. So the fa mily went to the beach, that™s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity, 
it was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that
™s not unusual. And the police picked me  
up, and I do recall that I was s
itting on the policeman™s lap, 
with a policeman™s cap on my 
head, waiting [indecipherable] 
was apparently relaxed enough, 
till they found -- till I was 
found, I think my brother came to pick me  up, an
d then reunited with the fa mily, so I was 

saved. That was what -- what -- what do we 
do. Second episode which I recall, was I took 
a walk with my sister [ind
ecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a 
shortcut through a park, and was hit by a w
ooden swing, that time the swings were wood, 
and I was apparently unconscious. I had a sort of
 a scar right over here
. They tell me  that 
had it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I 
would have been brain dead, centimeter 
below, I™d ha ve been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. I had stitches. Those da ys 

you had stitches with like staples, I reme mber that. And I reme mber the gift  comi ng 

home  to soothe my return, was a wind-up 
crocodile, which I wound up and I played on 
the dining room table, back and forth. So 
these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but 
they kind of illust rate I™d led a child™s norma l, quotation ma rk, child™s life in a home 

environment.  
 

Q: Do you remember your parents 
at tha -- i-i-in that period 
when you were [indecipherable] 
 

A: Yes, again, I reme mber them as, y -- know, se -- senior adults. 

 

Q: Right. 
 
A: I was the baby of the family, and I don™t reme
mber any story or event that kind of left a 
ma rk with me, but I knew my -- my mother 
was a housewife, and reme mber cleaning the 
house, and taking care of the household even
ts. The hou -- I mean, the household, as far 
as I recall, I have heard was ki
nd of gran -- rather norma l. We
 had a lot of visitors, I do 
recall people comi ng by, and we confirme d -- s
ubsequently I me t certain people, relatives 
[indecipherable] I visited when I was a little 
child with my parents, and down the line. 
And that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to fa milies. 
 

Q: Right. Wa s it a religious household? 

 

A: Yes, was a religious household. 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: It was re -- we were raised -- ra
-raised as observant Jews. Synagogue -- 
 

Q:  Was t h at  -- 

 

A: --attending-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
6 
 
 
 
Q: Was that unusual in Holland, or -- 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: -- not so much? 

 

A: Not really, no. First of all, Holland has tw
o or three communi ties, 
the more -- can™t say 
native, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutc
h are oriented, people had a number of 
generations. They had their 
own synagogues, and own community. Then there were the 

east European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted
 and integrated. But 
in Europe in general, there was much mo
re traditional conduct by people affiliated with 
synagogues, and went. My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in 

Zionist organizations. My brot
her -- my older brothers, Jose
f and Aron belonged to what 
later became Brei Akiva, but precursor of thos
e that were active in that, and I do kind of 
have me mor i es on Shabbat afternoons, they we
re leaving to their 
groups. All I really 
reme mber of my two ol der brothers in a me nt
al, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall 

boys with berets -- common people used to w
ear berets, and weeker pants, which were 
rolled up at the bottom a little
 bit, leaving, comi ng and goi
ng. But they were kind of 
active in youth organizations. So
 it wasn™t, again, in the broa
der sense, that description 
were a norma l family, as people would have li
ked to live, and were 
not allowed to live. 
 

Q: D-Do you recall your little friends that you 
had during that period [indecipherable] family 
and your -- 
 

A: I do not recall fr
iends at all -- 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- in fact, I mean, in part because  we had 
a sizeable family and had two children -- my 
bro -- siblings were close enough in age, I 
suppose. So I do not recall from before the 
war, anyone by name , or  so. That™s a -- whether I had it, I just don™t know, I mean, never 

discussed that with my br
other or sister at all. 
 

Q: Did you go to a nur -- was there some thing 
[indecipherable] to a nursery school, or -- 
 

A: No, I do recall starting school in 1942. I wa
s only half a year in school. We went to 
what™s called then a public Jewish school, it 
could -- what™s called nowadays day schools, 
most probably. They were Jewish schools, a
nd this was bef -- my brother went before 
that -- I had to go, cause at the time alrea
dy when I was going to school, I had to be 
enrolled in a Jewish school, it wouldn
™t -- now the Nazis did not allow -- 
 

Q: So that was late already. 

 

A: Latealready. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
7 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 

A: But I do reme mber for going to school, and 
in kind of the courtyar
d, singing, playing, and 
I was supposed to be a good boy, called in Dutch, witte boontje -- bon -- boontje, that 

was a white bean, that™s description of 
being in -- a goody-goody boy, or so. But the 
school period was a very tense period. Pe
ople -- there was all ki
nds of talk going on 
already around the house and in the school, mu
r murings. Wha t  it meant, I had no idea. I 
knew that some thing was brewing. 
 

Q: This is in ™42? 

 

A: That was ™42. 

 

Q: But you didn™t know what. 

 

A: No, but there was some t hing unusual, was 
nothing -- it was like some thing was involving 
-- and I sensed, I di -- I do recall sensi
ng -- to the school year
 was both disrupted 
obviously, I was -- it couldn™t la
st very long, several months only, but it was not a norma l 
school experience, because the people in th
e classes were eventually in doubt. People 
came, and people left. And I si -- this I -- this
 I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not -- 
not that I had been in school for ma ny years, 
so as what I did go to a pre-school, I don™t 
recall. But it was not a stable envi ronment, 
and this I had sensed right away, both at 
home , where there were mur murings, and mo
st [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst 
themselves some thing, you know, some thing that
™s serious. What exactly it was, I don™t 
recall. Wa s as bes -- I -- and was probably
 children brought into discussions. And of 
course I was too young, because I was a child.  
 

Q: Do you have a recollection of
 1940, when the Nazis occupied? 
 

A: No. No, no, no. 

 

Q: So you don™t -- 

 

A: No, wa -- w -- 

 

Q: Is -- is there a tr
ansition for you at all? 

 

A: The big transition really was when I was in sc
hool and I felt that -- I mean, for it -- I think 
it was big discussion which school I should go to
, whether I should start y -- with school. 
I re -- kind of there was general discussi
on, I was on -- certainly 
going to go to school. 
Because that already in -- was -- was probabl
y the fall, I assume  school began in the fall 
like over here, was come  to the end of our freedom, because people -- there were 

deportations, and there were r
ound-ups and there were sh -- 
transports taking place, so 
there was some  discussion whether or not I shou
ld start school. In retrospect it appears 
that my fa mi ly, my parents were almo st, I think, you know, how to deal with the family 

situation of how to -- not escap
e, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive. So if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
8 
 
 
they have to -- if I hid -- if
 they would place me  in hiding, or what have you, then you 
don™t start school, necessarily. But anyway, I did go to school, and that school 
environment, I sensed there was something in 
the air, what I don™t -- couldn™t specify. 
 

Q: But the kids didn™t talk with
 each other, that you reme mber? 
 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not -- 

 

Q: Do you remember seeing troops?  Do you 
reme mber seeing any soldiers, or -- 

 

A: Noth -- I can™t -- ca-can™t -- I™m looking 
[indecipherable] at my 
me ntal photograph file 
there, no, I don™t recall 
soldiers. There were soldiers on 
the street, but wa -- I ma y have 
treated them as policeme n, or so, so -- 
 

Q: Right. So you never saw anything 
that ma de you frightened, or -- 
 

A: No, no, no, again I that -- in
 that respect my parents prot
ected me , kept me , you know, do 
things -- I wore the -- 
 

Q: Astar. 

 

A: Astar. 

 

Q: And you reme mber that? 

 

A: On the clothing, yes. But again it didn™t imp
act me as it would have
 done later. It was a, 
you know, decoration that some thing -- that th
e -- only Jews were wearing it, I ma y not 
have been sensitive enough. 
 

Q: Right,yeah. 

 

A: Okay?  But I had to wear it, yes. But th
at™s, you know, you wear your sweater, you wear 
your jacket. 
 

Q: And do you think that the same  protection a
nd feeling of being -- you™re pretty safe, was 
true for your -- for Leo, and Leah -- 
 

A: I don™t know how far hi -- how hi-high it would 
went, right, then because an -- a -- a child 
in general is left out for these sort of 
discussions, and the youngest, I was a young child, 
was not -- was not a party. I was -- I was almo
st six and a half, seven, right?  So I was 
[indecipherable] a party to these discussions. 
I don™t really know how
 mu ch my brother -- 
my brother I think even more. 
 

Q: Leo, or the older -- 

 

A: Leo, Leo, Leo. The older brothers definitely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
9 
 
 
 
Q: Yeah, I me a n -- 

 

A: But I had very little ongoing contact with
 my older brothers, except as being older 
brothers, but not on a playing se-sense, and 
I don™t even recall which grade they were -- 
they were, you know, adults, and they were 
adults already. By 1942 
my oldest brother 
was -- ™24 to ™42 -- ah -- was 18 year
s old, and [indecipherable] was 16.  
 

Q: Right. So they were muc h older. 

 

A: They were much older. So the contact betw
een a seven year old, and 
a 18 or a 16 year old 
are -- 
 

Q: Bigdifference. 

 

A: Big difference.  

 

Q: Right. Now, do you re -- do you know how ma
ny months you mi ght have been in school?  
Was it a few months, or -- 
 

A: I think we we re in school three, four months. 

 

Q: Before you went to We s t erbork? 

 

A: Before -- no, before Westerbork, I was -- we were already --  our fa mily was split up. In -- 
in Novembe r , December, I think, our fa mily started splitting up. 
 

Q: 1941. 

 

A: ™42. ™42. 1942. 

 

Q: ™42. 

 

A: We end up in We sterbork in
 ™43, and in Terezin in ™44. 
 

Q: Uh-huh.Okay. 

 

A: [indecipherable] ™42 now. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: So [indecipherable] say it was -- that™s w
hy th -- you say whether or not I would go to 
school was [indecipherable] issue, cause by ™
42, in the fall of ™42, later developments 
with Dutch Jewry oc-occurred already, depor
tations, shipme nts, round-ups. We  were not 

last, but we were not first, either. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
10 
 
 
Q: Okay, so --  
 

A: So the fami l y planned to [indecipherable]
 our situation, and what wa -- was happening -- 
what happened was that my mother and two 
older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and 
Josef, they went to one locat
ion, my  sister to another, a
nd my brother and myself to 
another. And bro -- those locati
ons were strange in retrospect
, but ma de sense at the time. 
There was a notion that certain people are le
ss likely to be rounde
d up, or perhaps even 
immune, exempt. So if you stay, even with Jewi
sh fa milies that have that character about 
them, you are protected. So the notion was that 
my mother and her brothers, who were of 
working age, they were put into a -- a me nt
al asylum, because the thought was that they 
don™t need -- they™re not going to be prom -- 
people at -- either accep
ted or believed the 
case that there were the people being shippe
d for work. So, they™re not going to take 
people who have mental problems, they™l
l leave them alone, spend your energies 
elsewhere. My sister wa s placed
 in another type of home , an
d initially with, I believe in 
her case, a pregnant woma n, who a gain they 
thought wouldn™t be take
n, or a woma n who 
had just given birth. That was sort of conven
tional wisdom at that time, and so we were 
separated from our parent, and the parent 
itself -- my father st ayed at home. 
 

Q: Your father at home, your mother in 
another pl ace, where is the [indecipherable] 
 

A: My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my tw
o older brothers in another place, and my 
sister in one place, and my brother and I in anot her place. 
 

Q: And where were you then? 

 

A: Withmybrother. 
 
Q: No, I know that, but -- 

 

A: To -- to this fa mily, I think to 
-- to a woman had ju
st given birth. 
 

Q: And what were you told about -- I mean, it™s
 very odd for a little child to be separated 
like that. 
 

A: Yes, I™ll see you later, you 
know, we™ll come  back. Now, what  is interesting is that 
people had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my fath
er stayed at home apparently, was to kind 
of settle affairs, his belongings, and who 
knows what, and come  -- and contact with 

fa mily outside of Holland, I believe, which ev
entually ma terialized some what for that, 
and to ma ke arrangements for everybody. So,not clear whether our arrangements were 

temporary or permanent. My parents were
 the ones who were ma king those decisions, 

and I was obviously not privy to 
those at all. So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure, 
things were different, but whet
her it™s permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at 
all. And my brother was there, so maybe that 
acted as a sense of stability for me . And t he 
days went. There also was a conventional 
wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on 
fact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, 
evening. So in the morning, my father, he 
went to synagogue, and we went to synagogue 
too, we me t my father every morning at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
11 
 
 
synagogue. So that respect, things we re norma l.
 So we me t, and he patted me , chatted 
me , kissed me  or s -- what, and it was a daily 
event. And my  last image of my father is 
sitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next
 day I came  he wasn™t there. So then we 
knew that he was deported.  
 
Q: And you knew that, or you knew some thing? 

 

A: We knew some thing. 

 

Q: You knew some thing. 

 

A: Right, yeah, my brother and 
I knew some thing, right. And -- 
 

Q: And this is 1942? 

 

A: ™42, December ™42. 

 

Q: December ™42. So right at the end of the year. 

 

A: That™s end of the year. 

 

Q: So you are staying with this -- 
in this fa mily [indecipherable] 
 

A: Fa mily, right, now that didn™t last -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 
 
A: -- not di -- no, not -- not two, three months, 
not -- very short period. That family sofe 
either couldn™t keep us, or what have you, 
and we were put all three of us in an 
orphanage. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: Because again, the vi ew was that the orphanage
 is a safe haven. They aren™t going to take 
little children, little orphans.
 And meanwhile my mother a
nd two brothers were rounded 
up, my father was rounded up and they move 
-- they were shipped to We s t erbork in the 
end of January. 
 

Q: Of™43. 

 

A: ™43. 

 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: And mi ddle of January they were deported to 
Auschwitz and killed there three days later. 
We were rounded up a little la
ter, in February, I guess. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477

Q: In -- in February. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Okay. I think we have to
 stop it to change the tape. 
 

A: Okay. 

 

End of Tape #1

Tape #2 
 
Q: Charles, your parents were se
nt -- th -- your parents, your two 
older brothers were sent to 
Westerbork in January of ™43. 
 

A: Three,right. 

 

Q: And in February, you think -- 

 

A: We -- yes, we arrived in February. 

 

Q: You arrived in February, 
and were they sent out -- 
 

A: They were sent out of west
 -- out of Westerbork on the 18
th
 of January.  
 

Q: Huh, and -- and when did you find that out
, that wh -- that wa s the transport? 

 

A: Well, through the red -- subsequently, in rece
nt years, I™ve tried to trace down through the 
Red Cross, that -- curiou
s to find out what -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- formally happened, any document a tion. 
Took a long time , oddly enough. It™s very 
strange that the record keeping was so 
uneven. After the war -- I mean, now moving -- 
 

Q: Yes. 
 
A: -- on to a different subject ma tter, after the 
war, people tried to find out what happened to 
their relatives. And in our case, we we re more
 or less told by relatives
 and others, that our 
parents were deported and se
nt to Auschwitz and that 
was the als -- we had no 
documentation for that. As a child I did not pursu
e it very much, but later on as an adult, I 
tried to pursue it, especially when I read a
bout that the Red Cr oss had tracing of a sort. 
And the first few answers was -- is all we know 
is that they were de
ported to Auschwitz, 
we don™t know when, where. Later on they
 gave us a date, but no formal document 
confirma tion. In year 2001
st
, I got a Red Cross notification with documentation. Now, it 
turns out that  in the Dutch regist ry, in the 
-- the governme nt has a regis -- gazettes of a 

sort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed name s of
 the fate of various people, and they send 
us a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who 
we addressed -- now, had we known that 
it was in the registry, I would have gone to th
e Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that 
it is available. So the fi rst time I actually
 had confirma tion of my parents death and 
departure dates, which initia
lly came really out, that was 
in year 2000. A long time. And 
in fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- comme m
oration, not celebration, comme moration of 
deceased, wa s an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to comme morate. So -- 

you ma y be aware that the rabbinate in Israel
 selected one date of the year for those 
people that did not know when their imme diat
e fa milies were  killed, or di ed. And they 
select ed the 10
th
 of Tevet, but -- so we observe that
 day as our Yahrzeit day. So the f -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
14 
 
 
took us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actu
al date, which turned out to be the 15
th
 of 
Shavuot, so -- 
 
Q: And did We sterbork have de
portation lists, or they didn™t? 
 

A: Did they have -- I -- yeah, I™m sure they ha
d, but -- there™s just wh
at happened after the 
war, a lot of people ma de confusion, a lot of
 people ma de efforts, di -- they hit a 
roadblock, and they kind of 
called it quits, or so, and 
nobody came  notifying us. I me a n, 
this is a problem, it™s a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn™t know us, and we 

didn™t know who knew, okay?  So you ask me  
how do I know the dates, now it™s in black 
and white and confirme d, and it™s from lists 
--  a bi g list in the Du
tch registry. I have a 
copy of the registry here with me .  
 

Q: Now, did your mother arrange for the thr
ee of you to go to an
 orphanage?  Do you kno -- 
do you know how that was arranged at all? 
 

A: I believe it was pr
obably through my father. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- 
in beginning of January, I believe, the first 
week or so, and then they were -- must have 
been a week or so in We sterbork, and so we 

were -- was probably more through my father. Th
e -- these -- there we
re a lot of ad hoc 
arrangements during that pe
riod. Some  were planned, a
nd some  were, you know, you had 
to improvise, and as -- when one option kind of
 reached it™s end of contini -- continue, 
like me  being in these private homes, where 
people thought was safe, they found a next 
tier. So we lasted another month in these di
fferent places, compared
 to my parents and 
my brothers. And then you ask me , you know, did I know what was happening to me , the 

answer is no. I was, know, placed. I was with 
people. I was most probabl y being fed, and 
taken care of, and that took care of me. I did 
know that i -- used to 
go to the synagogue in 
the morning, routine, that stopped. And my br
other knew more , he knew that -- what it 
meant. That once he didn™t see us, that he
™d been dep -- rounded up and being deported. 

So it must have -- 
 

Q: And he -- he didn™t tell you?  
Do you reme mber -- any recollection? 
 

A: Idon™treally. 

 

Q: Youdon™t. 

 

A: I don™t really know. I 
don™t know that part.  
 

Q: So not seeing your parents, I mean -- 

 

A: Yes? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
15 
 
 
Q: Being in this different place -- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- this woma n™s home -- 

 

A: Yeah,right. 

 

Q: -- and seeing your father every 
day, would give you the sense of -- 
 

A: Of some  nor ma lcy, also, right -- 

 

Q: Some  nor ma lcy, right. 

 

A: Exactlyright. 

 

Q: And then it stops. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And now you™re in an orphanage. 

 

A: Yes. With other children. 

 

Q: With other children. Do you feel -- you don™t feel insecure? 

 
A: I apparently don -- 
 

Q: You don™t reme mber? 

 

A: Idon™tremember. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: But again, you can keep in mi nd, if you r
ec -- reconstruct, if 
you™re among a lot of 
children, suddenly, you are busy, 
you play, you eat, and you™re
 taken care of, and you 
start forgetting. It™s like, you 
know, little children with babysitters, when the mother™s -- 
parents go on vacation, ma y cry beginning, and 
subsequently settle down, and -- not that 
it was so nor -- I™m -- not that it was all sh
ipped away. I don™t reca
ll being shipped away. 
But that was circumstances. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So I did not attribute it to, you know, immi ne
nt danger, or -- except my parents no longer 
were visibl e with me, I™d -- I -- my mother ha
d less contact, because
 while I was comi n g 
to the synagogue in the morning, was my father. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
16 
 
 
 
Q: Not your mo ther. 

 

A: Not my mot her. 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: And not my older brothers. So
 definitely I must have sens
ed things were different, but 
whether that is permanent, or whether that 
is dangerous, or [indeci
pherable] I don™t think 
a child could catch it immediately, because 
nothing terrible was happening to me . I 
wasn™t being beaten up, or on the street, or some thing of this sort. So I mean, I was under 

some body™s supervision and auspices, and 
that™s how I -- I to
ok it, I suppose. 
 

Q: Do you know whether this was a Jewish orphanage? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: It was a Jewi sh orphanage? 

 

A: I believe it -- 

 

Q: So all the kids were Jewi sh? 

 

A: -- I believe it -- I believe it was a Jewi sh orphanage. I believe so. 

 

Q: Yeah. 
 
A: But again, based on this assumption, that 
certain categories of 
people are going to be 
bypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups 
notion obviously came very known in the 
Jewish community. People™s friends and relativ
es were being picked up, and people swen 
-- started going into hiding, 
or escaping, or what have you. Some  tried to ma ke 
provisions. Then they tried to find wa ys whic
h regarded what are -- where could we or 
our children be safe? And the idea of splitti
ng up fa milies was not a illogica l step, that  if 
some  people can™t ma ke it, other could ma ke
 it. And very often, you can™t have a place 

for seven people, you can have a place fo
r two or three. So you had to split up on 
practical grounds. So, did it hit me  that 
some thing was affecting me , you know, lifetime 
orsat, I doubt it, it was kind of 
incremental, another step or 
so. But di -- bottom line was, 
you know, I was separated from my parents at
 that age, and that was it. And then 
separated fro m my brothers and mo ther, and that
 was it. And I was with my little --  ol der 
brother, few years older, and a little older si
ster, and that we were
 together. And then I 
followed what was -- not instructed, where I 
was told to go, where to go, and move, and I 
moved along with the -- the flow. 
 

Q: And you we re a good kid. 

 

A: Apparently. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
17 
 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Okay. But in February when we we re 
rounded up, I do recall the round-up part in 
particular. We put on the train, and it wa
s a round-up place in
 Amsterdam, the 
Schouwburg, I think it™s called. Schombu 
-- Schomb -- Schouwburg, it used to be a 
theater. That became the round-up place for all the Jews in Amsterda m.  
 

Q: But now I™m a little confused. 

 

A: Yes? 

 

Q: Were you now living in Amsterdam?  Because they [indecipherable] 

 

A: Oh, the orphanage was -- the orphanage was in Amsterda m.  

 

Q: InAmsterdam. 

 

A: Oh yes, the orpha
nage in Amsterdam. 

 

Q: But your father was not
 living in Amsterdam. 

 

A: In The Hague. 

 

Q: In The Hague. 

 
A: Hague. 
 

Q: Which is fr -- 

 

A: He was rounded up in The Hague. 

 

Q: I see, okay. 

 

A: He was rounded up in The Hague, and my -- 
I don™t recall where the me ntal institution 
was -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: It was probably as -- out -- they didn™t have
 institutions in the citi
es, it was probably in 
the outskirt, some place. And -- but the round-ups don™t -- they took the collected people 

and assembled them, and they brought them all to Amsterdam. That was the collection 

point. And then f -- 
 

Q: Right. And you re -- you reme mber 
being taken out of the orphanage? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
18 
 
 
A: I reme mber the -- being in the trai n in Am
sterdam, and people scurrying back and forth 
from the window. In fact, one of my relatives
 was one of -- see th
e -- they had a -- the 
council of Jewish -- Jewish council had to 
do a lot of the paperwork for the round-ups, 
both identify and do the works. I do recall peop
le scurrying in front of the window, and 
mut -- this relative of mi ne who I knew, waving to me . I could see it now, I me an -- and 
then we were put on the train to We sterbork. 
That was the next stop, the next move ment, 
in February, someti me. 
 

Q: February™43. 

 

A: ™43. Turns out that had we arrived unde
r norma l circumstances, we -- they had a 
procedure in We sterbork when people arrive
d, the next Tuesday, or the following one, 
people were picked -- designated to go to 
the next stop. That time , ™43, the destination 
was Auschwitz. One after the other, every 
week or two, there was a trainload -- 
 

Q: On Tuesdays, right? 

 

A: On Tuesday, right.  

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: When we arrived in We s t er
bork, we would have designated to
 go the next shipme nt, but -
- like everybody else, it wasn™t 
exceptional. It turned out 
our good fortune was there was 
a scarlet fever epidemic in Westerbork, a ce
rtain barracks, so they put the camp in 
quarantine, they wanted to protect the German
 sol diers, they don™t want to get sick. So 
this int --  this -- they halted the shipments for 
a week or so. That week
 was critical for us, 
because while we were there, during that quara
ntine, a very good friend of our fa mily™s in 
Amsterdam,  Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by 
telegram most probably, We sterbork 
authorities, the Jewish people, or the council 
people who worked there, that documents 
from our fa mily in Switzerland, with Hondur
an passports, and also, I think, Palestine 
visas were ma de available for us and our pa
rents and brothers. Unfortunately for them it 
came too late. But that week of window save
d us, because then we put in different 
category of person, because we had Central Am
erican passports, and 
they treated that a 
little separa te, and the Palestin
e visa part, they also had so
me  benefit for awhile, because 
they wanted to exchange German prisoners 
for British citizens or what have you, and it 
put us into a different classification of deta
inee, and then we were in this new category, 
and we were put into different grouping. Butwithout that week of scarlet fever, I 

wouldn™t be talking to you. 
 

Q: You would have been sent
 imme diately on the train -- 
 

A: Yes, we -- the norm -- right. The reason 
why -- we wouldn™t be 
any different than 
anybody else. That was the pattern, people came, and left. 
 

Q: Now, did you know, cause you™re now 
a little bit older, you™re eight -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
19 
 
 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: Right?  Or seven and a half?  Seven. 

 

A: Seven. 

 

Q: Seven. 

 

A: Seven. 

 

Q: Were you told -- this scarlet fever quarantine -- 

 

A: We were -- no, n-no, we were told -- 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: No, but we -- I was told about the papers, some thing. 

 

Q: You were told that? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing which I was 
told, I -- again, is our parents, from the train 
send a postcard. That was very standard to dr
op postcards, and if they were lucky, other 
citizens would pick it up and put 
it into the ma il. And was given to my brother, he -- my 
brother became  the oldest person of the fa
mily, and I was told my brother had had a 
postcard from my parents, from what -- wh
at it meant, I didn™t know, but it was now 
wishing us well, take care, and in fact gave 
us the name  of a rela
tive in Switzerland if you 
need help. And at the end of the postcard our
 br ot he r s  wr ot e  in He
brew [indecipherable] 

see you. So I -- this I recall, my brother te
lling me walking some
where in Westerbork, 
and telling pos -- not that -- I 
don™t know, he tells more late
r, but the -- that we got a 
postcard from our parents on the train, wherever
 it is. Whatever that  meant for me, I don™t 
know how to re-interpret it, but 
that little bit of infor mation 
was given to us, but then we 
put into a new category of pe
ople -- not that we knew that
 we were different there 
[indecipherable] cause we  didn™t have the se
nse of this timetable which we know now. 
People didn™t know, necessarily -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- that -- came  very rapidly. Now, movi
ng people arrived, stayed, were registered, and 
then they were shipped out to death camps. 
 

Q: How do you picture We
s t erbork in your mi nd? 
 

A: Small barracks, little wooden 
barracks, I recall, and we we
re put under the guidance of a 
s-s -- orphanage equivalent, a per -- one fa m
ily was designated to take care of children 
who were separated from their parents, or lo
st their parents, or what have you. And we 
put in that group, a ma n name d Birnbaum, 
Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
20 
 
 
apparently, and that was his task. He had 
a number of children as well, so I became 
friendly with his child, or he™d
 like me  to play with hi
s child, so I hung around his house 
more than the standard barracks most of the day. And I kind of took care of us, 
collectively. But that st atus helped us, becau
se we not put on lists. There is one episode 
my brother related to me , which I obviously 
was not aware of. They didn™t always trust 
those documents, [indecipherable] they were 
-- we re suspicious, and the fact came from 
Switzerland helped a little bit, but they calle
d my brother in, and was asking him what do 

you know about Honduras?  Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. So he 

was called in, and he was primed by some one, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should 

say. And he was told that his mother™s in 
Switzerland, to kind of confir m it, the source 
came -- that came from his moth
er, rather than relatives. 
She was Swiss born, some how. 
Was -- lived in Switzerland ma ny years, and appa
rently -- he  told me  recently again, that 
he was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how™d you get these 

things? My mother™s in Switzerland. And 
they accepted, asked what -- where™s your 
father, and he didn™t -- wa sn™t given any pr
ompting for that, so he some how answered, 
he™s dead, and they let him go. But again, Imean, those are kind of intermediate steps 

where our status was even being questioned, a
nd had they determined that it was a fake, it 
wasn™t -- we weren™t really, you know, Hondur
an citizens, or whatever, the passports 

were not -- we then would have been shippe
d, that interval. So we spent the year in 
Westerbork among children. 
 

Q: So you lived in a barrack with children? 

 

A: Lived in a barrack with children, yes.  

 

Q: Do you remember the food? 
 
A: Very little. Was a s -- I reme mber 
a little more the food about Terezin -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- than the food in We sterbork, but there wa
s food. I was, I think, not preoccupied with 
no -- being, again with -- in a group of child
ren, that -- wa -- which probably helped me  

in various stages, that eventually yeah, 
you played, and you spend your time, and wha -- 
wa-was fed, and that was it. My brother was a 
little more advanced, 
so he most probably 
had to kind of keep his ears out what™s happe
ning, and he was theref
ore more perceptive. 
But I was not drawn into that or
bit at that st age of the game. 
 

Q: Did you notice children comi ng and going -- 

 

A: Comi ng and go -- yes, yes, yes,
 yes, I noticed that there. 
 

Q: But that di dn™t necessarily affect you, because -- 

 

A: No, because I was there, you see, and as long 
as I stayed next morn
ing there -- I didn™t -- 
I mean, it™s -- again, under the circumstances
, my age, had no reason for me  to think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
21 
 
 
about the inst ability of the situation. I m
ean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know, 
look what happened, were you scared, were 
you -- there™s no -- no reason. I me an, the 
saving feature was that I hung around with chil
dren, cause I was a child, and I was placed 
with -- in a children™s home, effectively. He
 was the guardian of a number of children, 
lots of them. 
 

Q: ThisBirnbaum? 

 

A: Birnbaum. And I was even better off, I was 
put in close contact with his own children. So 
I was playing and ma ybe  eating at his table, 
who knows what?  There were fa mily units in 

these camp s ituations, so that kept a li
ttle sense of norma lcy. Not having my parents 

some how did not hit me  during that period. 
 

Q: Was there some thing like a school? 
Did you have classes at some  point? 
 

A: They have both there and in Terezin, 
they had little groups of study groups to keep 
people entertained and educated a little 
bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject 
ma tter, holidays, songs, and both -- some  songs, 
in fact I do recall the music to this day. 
And -- 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Wh- What -- what do you recall? 

 
A: There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom
, with the prayer. It was a round. [sings a 
few lines]. And we sang that, okay?  And a nother one, Shomer Yisrael. Now, they™re 
interesting in retrospect, those two songs, wh
ich also in Terezin, th
e -- exactly the same  
songs were taught, I recall, is quite rema rkable
, because both of them are the prayers of 
hope. We  didn™t know the translation as muc
h, but the teachers kind of were injecting 
hope on this place, peace on Isra
el. Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of 
Israel. So, those two songs I reme mb er to this
 day, but I didn™t have
 -- it turns out that -- 
that people used to sing them subsequen
tly too, so I don™t know what I would -- 
 

Q: I see. Sing a little bit of the second song? 

 

A: [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It 
was a choir rounding song, or so. And -- so we 
had instructions, we had learning in both 
Terezin and ams -- and We sterbork. We sterbork 
I reme mber more concreteness that I know the 
loft where we went up, the third floor of 
the caserne, third tier,
 not [indecipherable] floor, had th
ree layers. We  we nt up, and we 
did our little studying, whatever it had to
 study, you know, instru
ction, the stories, 
holidays, about Israel, Pa le
stine. And there was a watc
hman in front of the door 
watching, because we™re not allowed to have
 formal classes, and the watchman in 
[indecipherable] I reme mber the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their 

equivalent came  by to inspect the place, 
we got the warning, and we started playing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
22 
 
 
cards, or game s, or wha t  have you. Very, very
 similar to the story about Chanukah, where 
people -- one reason why people played dreidl , 
because they -- because at that time also, 
people were prohibited to study the Torah, a
nd with guards comi ng by, and then people 
improvised games.  
 
Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: And so we went through that in 1943 and 
™44. But there was instru
ction, but not formal.  
 

Q: Could you read?  Did you have so
me  instruction [indecipherable] 
 

A: I had some instruction, well I had 
very little formal education -- 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: -- with three months or so, 
at best, in Holland, I -- yes, I learned how to read, ma ybe even 
before at home , I don™t recall where. But I reme mber I read Dutch.  
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And my voc abulary obviously was limited. Wa
s -- didn™t develop, I didn™t have more -- I 
spoke Dutch among the Dutch people in We
sterbork, obviously Dutch. And in Terezin 
also. But I didn™t read books in the normal se
nse of the term. But there was instruction. 
People spent again, their time. They devot -- th
ere were forme r  teachers who were idle, 
so they had some  to do, and people took on resp
onsibility to keep the kids occupied, and 
study with them. So that was fa miliar things
, but not when it came back after the war I 
had handicap when [indecipherable] do some  
arithme tic or anything of this sort.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I didn™t have the same  
background as other children. 
 

Q: I -- I read that the weather in We sterbork 
was horrible. Do you have any recollection if 
that™s true?  
 

A: Yeah, well, the weather was raw. Dutch w
eather is not, you know, the mo st comfortable 
weather except in the spr -- summertime or s
o. It™s a vari ation of British weather, wet, 
cold. I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, 
but not as a personal suffering part, that it 
was ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, 
in retrospect I just
 don™t recall how we 
survived both the deprivation and weather 
conditions, both in West
erbork, and Terezin, 
which is even colder, because we didn™t co
me  with, you know, baggage of clothing. Must 
have had some  bags, and as we moved up in 
age, we grew. Now, I ma y have taken my 
brother™s clothing, but [indeciphe
rable] my brother get? Now, we didn™t grow that much. 
We were stunted in our growth, most probabl
y, but we still grew. So the question ma rk 
still is, where did we get our clothing?  We  ma
y have gotten it from other people who left, 
and the children™s home ma y well have supplie
d us. But we didn™t certainly have our own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
23 
 
 
wardrobe to take care of us, particularly in 
cold weather. So every so often I do reflect, 
how did we ma nage in cold weather in gene
ral, with limited clothi
ng, and not having our 
own clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provi
de. But I -- I sp -- I 
assume  that these 
people like Mr. Birnbaum, and 
subsequently in Theresienstadt the woma n who took care 
of us, kind of assembled ma terial, and that there 
-- that was part of their job, to ma ke sure 
the children under their charge
 have clothing. And where th
ey got it from was probably 
from people who had to -- we-were transporte
d and left, and then 
it redistributed. So I 
don™t know how bitter the cold was for me  
personally. But it -- I do know it was drab. 
 
Q: Were you also limited where you could walk
?  Could you just stay around where this 
barrack was? 
 

A: Well, here again see, I in some  sense wa
s a beneficiary of being a young child. I had no 
reason to parade in the large areas like mo
st norm [indecipherable] and I was in this 
Birnbaum fa mily, in their -- and was probably 
nu -- wherever  I slept in the barracks, in 

the morning go to the Birnbaum™s. So that 
was my routine, so no reason for me  to 
wonder.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So the rest rictions that existed most pr
obably di d not impair me, because there was no 
need for me  to wander around. So that
 respect, being young was a blessing. 
 

Q: And were you required to have a Jewish 
star on your clothes as
 well, do you reme mb er? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  
 
Q: Youdid? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. But that did not necessarily, you know, i mpact me  dra matically because 
that we had -- that [indeciphe
rable] was on my sweater, and 
I wa -- it was cold you wore 
a sweater, you wore that with the yode star 
on it. So again, in looki
ng back on it, being a 
sm-small child, or a very young aged little boy pr
otected me , gave me  my  own little area 
of protection, that I did not f
ace a lot of the other things which I would ha ve faced four 
years later.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: My brother had more exposure, both in We
sterbork and in Terezin, because as you move 
up the ladder of age, you get -- 
you™re drawn into these other 
restrictions. So I can™t say 
that I felt, you know, restricted or inhibite
d, like most children in
 today™s environment 
most probably wouldn™t feel re
stricted if they cannot cro
ss the street. You know, if you 
ask them 20 years later, did you feel dil --
 were you a prisoner 
of your neighborhood?  I 
don™t think they would express it in these terms. 
 

Q: That ma kes sense. We ™re going to have to change the tape right now.

Q: Okay. Is there anything el
se that you would reme mber 
from Westerbork before you get 
sent to Terezin? 
 

A: Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that
 could me ntion -- that I have me ntioned. I 
[indecipherable] come  back subsequently. 
 

Q: Right,okay. 

 

A: No, I think that™s -- the time
 passed, and then we were -- 
 

Q: Now, you™re a year -- 

 

A: A year, we -- 

 

Q: AtWe sterbork-- 

 

A: --yes. 

 

Q: -- from what , February -- 

 

A: FebruarytoFebruary. 

 

Q: -- fe -- February. 

 
A: Right. 
 

Q: So in February ™44 -- 

 

A: ‚44 

 

Q: Now, does some body come  and tell you tomorrow you™re going to go to another place?  I 
mean, how -- 
 

A: Not to me , Leo. 

 

Q: Not to you? 

 

A: Not to me , a gain. I was -- I don™t feel bad be
ing left out. No, but we were told that ending 
up in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Ther
esiens tadt -stadt, as you know, was a place where 
they -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second 
holding place, holding pattern. Pr imarily people 
who had certain privileges stay -- privilege
d status, and our stat us kind of held, and 
therefore Westerbork was a place to -- transi
ts, spot to get people out, and so we were 
there in some sense too long, we didn™t bel
ong in Westerbork because we™re not transit 
people, and we were not trans
it to get transported, so they mo ved them to a new place, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
26 
 
 
which -- Theresienstadt, which was designed 
for our kinds of people, all kinds of 
privileged people. I had no idea that I was pr
ivileged obviously, but that
 settled in later. 
But -- so I had no sense that that™s a new 
regime , you know, for me . But my brother and 
sister were there, of course, must -- that 
must have been very reassuring, to have my 
brother and sister with me  on 
an ongoing basis. That was my 
anchor of fa mily stability, 
and the rest was activities 
throughout the day, or evening. So when I was -- when we 
were going to Terezin, we  were put under 
the auspices of a social worker from 

Amsterdam,  also was being shipped ther
e with her husband, her name  wa s Malka 
Weinma nn, and her husband Paul We inma nn, who -- they placed some  children under 

their responsibility. And we ended up in 
the train, which again I do reme mber the 
physical feature of the train, it was a co
mpar -- a European compartment train, was 
probably third class, but it wa
s not the cattle trai n, whic
h people unfortunately were 
subjected to as well. Wa s a commercial type of
 trai n with compartment, and we sat there, 
my brother, my sister, myself, the two We
inma nns, two elderly pe
ople, Rosens, elderly 
people, and another girl Alicia
 Farber, who was separated from
 her parents, so she was all 
alone as well. And we had this train trip to
 another place. And in
 the trai n, I was -- was 
probably playing on the fl oor, with whatev
er we had over there, and Miss Malka 
Pollaczek had a suitcase which 
I opened up, as a curious chil
d would ordinarily do, and I 
played with whatever she had over there, I in
spected it. And it was a big t-tin can there, 
and I asked her what is this all about, what is 
this for?  And so she te
lls me, we™ll use that 
at happy occasion. Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my 

brother™s Bar Mitzvah, close to 
-- to the following year. But that -- that  scene of the train 
ride I remember like a photograph, sitting th
ere, and we mo ved onto -- fr om Westerbork 
to Theresienstadt.  
 

Q: Do you know how long it took? 
 
A: Several days, I believe. 

 

Q: And did they wein -- the We inma nns have f
ood that they brought with them, so that you 
could eat?  
 

A: They brought some  food, yes. They brought 
some food and provision
s. And I assume -- I 
assume  now that we also had our little bags
 -- people allowed to br
ing along one suitcase, 
or some  bag or so. So whatever we had -- wh
at it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor 
does my brother really reme mber. I asked 
him. But people had their belongings. And 
when we came to Theresienstadt, we  were placed with the Dutch population. They was s-

segmented, they compartmentalized the people. So metimes different groups met all 

across th-the borders, in some  sense, but
 we were among the Dutch. That again, in 
retrospect most probably help
ed because again, Dutch language was the language we sp -

- I heard, and people spoke. Not that we 
knew people -- I don™t think we knew ma ny 
people over there, but so
me  -- turned out we had some  re
latives of my mo ther as well, 
whom we de alt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our 

guardian, Malka Pollaczek. And she, in fact, wa
s put in charge of the children™s home in 
Terezin as well, which came to my advantag
e later. The Dutch compound, we were put in 
the caserne, that -- not -- not ba
rracks, barracks were flat, us
ually, and caserne was pretty 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
27 
 
 
impressive stone buildings with courtyar
ds, and surrounding were -- originally were 
ma de for quarters for soldiers. And they used it for the people who were put into 
Theresienstadt, in detention purposes, and th
ey multiplied the number of people in the -- 
those casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. Had three 

tiers, beds -- three bunk beds. And men were 
separated from the wome n. And I now went 
with my brother, and my sister was -- what 
-- was accessi ble, I went to vi sit my sister. 
 

Q: She was in a different place? 

 

A: Also in the same  Ha mborg caserne, that
™s where the Dutch were. And they were 
[indecipherable] pretty impressive stone stru
ctures. And in that 
respect you look at it 
now, it looks like, you know with
 the courtyard, with kind of
 tiered, round hallways. But 
all of that was very crowded, and not very, 
you know attractive. But people always say 
that Terezin is an attractiv
e place compared with the ot
her concentration camps, and 
they™re absolutely correct in that respect, 
but it™s not a place r
ecommend for a vacation. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Or for a pleasant journey. It was -- had 
it™s own drabness all the tim
e, of the stench and 
the physical environment. So again, I do see a vi
si -- a vision of a -- of
 the scene of brown 
wooden bunk beds, three tiers, and lots of pe
ople, and crowded, and noisy. But it was not 
a calm environment. Bedbugs, lice on the beds, 
killing at night was 
an activity, you know 
to s-swipe them, do away with
 them. And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin. 

Now, Terezin I reme mber a little bit more, b
ecause I was older, so I have more mental 
images of Terezin. In ret -- in comparison 
to everything else, it was spacious. Wa s -- 
okay?  Because you had these big courtyards, an
d then from caserne to caserne there was 
another walkway, and when you mo ved down from
 there -- there I did walk outside of 
the caserne for a reason I™ll tell you in a mi nut
e. So you had a sense of not being totally 
confined to one building, or one narrow area.
 And that kind of tri -- helped the physical 
benefit from being that -- not [indecipherabl
e] confined. But it wa -- once you™re in the 
barracks, it was very crowded. But I was basi
cally confined to that quarters for line-up, 

for soup, for the meals, and for daily activit
y. And the learning study group I me ntioned 
before, the study group was up in that loft, up to
 the left, if I recall 
correctly, where we  -- 
I went on a basis. So I di dn™t, again, wande
r around much till later in Terezin. And a lot 
of the parts of Terezin I neve
r stepped across, because I ha
d no business to be there. I 
ma y not even allowed to be there for a
ll I know. So you stuck where you belonged, and 
where I had some  reason to be. And my reasons to
 be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the 

study place, the first stag
e of my stay there. A
nd spent the time there.  
 

Q: Let me  go back for a mo me nt. Do you 
reme mber your arrival in Theresienstadt? 
 

A: Yes, yes.  

 

Q: What was that like? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
28 
 
 
A: We had to walk a long distance from the 
train. Later, I think they extended the train 
tracks, because when -- eventually right outsi
de  of Hamborg caserne , there was a fence, 
and the train tracks that was 
visible to my -- later on I saw people come  and go, those 
[indecipherable] my activities during the day. 
But I don™t think in our time we got that 
close. We  had to walk, I think a half an
 hour [indecipherable] what. But there was a 
parade of people ma rching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my le gs 

held up, and that was it. So it didn™t leave 
as an impression of a torturous rite. I don™t 
know what id -- had no idea what I was in for.
 See, adults in all 
likelihood have more 
uncertainties and more concerns for -- they
 knew who they left be
hind, what they left 
behind, rumors, all of that. So they™re walking 
with a di fferent attitude that I -- I was a 
child again, not -- be -- being protected and be
ing ignorant helped. So I walked. But I did 
not, you know, find that, you know, gruesome  or 
onerous. I ma y have been tired, as a 
child, but moved along, you know. I was prodded al
ong, and that was it. So I -- that part, 
in some sense I skipped easier than settling into the place. 
 

Q: Was there a regist
ration process at -- 
 

A: There was a registration process, which 
I don™t recall being involved, ma ybe Miss Malka 
Pollaczek took care of, ma ybe my
 brother took care of it. Vaguely I recall some thing, 
standing on lines. Lot of line standing in Te
rezin in general. Li ning for food, was a line 
always. Morning line-up some ti me s. Evening I th
ink also. So there were lines, so -- but at 
the -- the registration p -- part
, again I -- I -- being a child, 
you -- I take it for granted you 
stand in line, or you do it, what you were told 
to do, so -- so it neve
r left a big impact on 
me , or i mpr ession, as other people find that
 -- was very cold when we arrived in 
February. And again, as I me ntioned, for how we
 survived overall cold with inadequa te 
clothing, in all likelihood, pretty
 impressive. Course I went 
-- we visited in 1996, Terezin, 
was also February, by chance, and was bitter, b
itter cold with a winter jacket, and with 
gloves and a scarf. And tell my wife that 
not see how I could have done that so ma ny 
years before, but I did.  
 

Q: Right, right. Did you see a
ny brutality when you first arri
ved?  Were peopl
e screaming? 
 

A: No, no, no, no, no -- 

 

Q: Nothing. 

 

A: I don™t recall anything like that. 

 

Q: So while it was crowded, it wa
s not a hysterical scene to you. 

 

A: I don™t -- I didn™t -- I don™t 
recall any of that, 
I mean I don™t know whether there was or 
there wasn™t. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So, I mean I  can™t be a witness for th
at. I more recall was the daily routine.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
29 
 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m. 

 

A: The food line-up, I recall. All 
of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a 
little me tal bowl and a spoon. How I, as a 
young child in 1944, held
 onto that without 
losing it -- I believe I didn™t lose it, I stil
l wonder. Because nowadays a lot of school kids 
can™t keep their lunch card for one day, or ot
her tickets, or so, and 
that mu -- mean -- it 
was [indecipherable] my survival. Inorder 
to get food you need th
e bowl, you need the 
card. And I never lost the card. 
 

Q: Where -- where would you put the bowl?  Di
d you tie it on a belt or some thing, or you 
don™t know? 
 

A: Carried it with me , or put it back in
 the barrack when I wa -- was through. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: But I have again these images of wa lking 
around at the -- at the 
serving time , with a 
spoon and a bowl, and lining up. And there was 
a strategy of where to line up, and when 
to line up, because the main meal often c
ontaine d like a barley soup. And if you came 
early you got the water, if you ca me  at theend you got nothing. If you want to get water 

and barley, which had the most substance, you 
had to be positioned in the right time of 
your line-up, the people positione d themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for 

position where to go, partly because of what you get. And I was part of that jockeying. 
 

Q: And you knew that? 
 
A: I sensed it, yeah, I knew th
is, I knew that, I was [indeci
pherable] to become -- after 
awhile I become  streetwise. And I was again to
ld -- but that was part of my job, to be 
there on time, at the right time,
 the right place to get a bette
r serving. There were time s  I 
came late. There were times I came too ear
ly. But every can™t be in the mi ddle, 
obviously. But that whole -- not tension, that wh
ole -- at -- at -- at
tention, too, and focus 
on getting your food or so, became 
part of your daily routine.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: You know, have your bowl and have your food 
and have your line-up. Li ke it was a time  
consuming affair through three times --  
 

Q: And what -- what did this 
ration card look like?  Did y -- 
did some one cl -- clip off -- 
 

A: Clipped off a piece -- I think they we re -- 

 

Q: They clipped off a piece? 

 

A: Yes, piece of paper I think 
that little sections to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
30 
 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 lit
tle coupons, and took -- each day took three. 
 

Q: And did you get the soup outside, or inside? 

 

A: Outside,outside. 

 

Q: It was outside -- 

 

A: In the cour tyard. 

 

Q: -- and you ate -- and you ate outside. 

 

A: I think ate outside, and so metimes inside. 
But they out -- the courtyard was it --  a pl ace 
where again, you saw [indecipherable] one 
photograph, that was the kind of scene you 
could reme mber. All Jewish pe
ople in -- interned people who 
were there, with coats and 
the star on their jackets we
re serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who 
knew who you were, you know?  And it was a daily
 routine. The food wa sn™t very mu ch 
food to eat. With black bread, with cok -- grai
n coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got 
too. The barley soup, several times a week 
there was horsemeat, and vegetables. Now, 
one vegetable which lasted for me  afte
r the war, as well as a -- we called a 
[indecipherable] initially, is a -- some
thing which young people don™
t know, now we call 
them green beans, but they were used to cal
l string beans. Now, st
ring beans had a lot of 
strings in the one they served. You ate,
 and you had your mo uth, basically you had the 
feel of those greens, whatever you got, and 
then the mouth ful l  of these strings, which 

you couldn™t chew, you couldn™t digest, and you 
spit them out, or so [indecipherable]. 
That was my concept of eating string beans.
 So after the war, when it was served, I 
couldn™t eat them for awhile. Because they als
o, still in 40™s, they 
still had some  strings, 
not as much string or so. So that was the 
kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it 
kept me  going. 
 

Q: Were you hungry?  Do you reme mbe r  being -- feeling hungry? 

 

A: I don™t recall feeling hun
gry, but was pretty standardized me a l , no, you know, special 
features. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Pretty routine, but you went -- that 
was, again, became the norm, and you -- you took 
what you got and you went on line in order to
 get your food, that was -- you came  every 
day, you ate this, and -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
31 
 
 
A: -- your rations were adequate enough to k
eep going. I wasn™t work
ing, so I was kind of, 
you know, wandering around most of the day. 
And -- but the -- the food item was an 
important part of the day. And having pr
otect your bowl and your ration coupon was an 
occupation, apparently. 
 
Q: Did your brother work? 

 

A: My brother did -- 

 

Q: Was he old enough? 

 

A: -- he was old enough, he was put in 
some  work activity, like me ssenger. 
 

Q: Really? Uh-huh. 

 

A: He served as a me ssenger. Deliver internal 
-- they had -- see, Terezin was organized as a 
functioning concentration camp 
with certain activities, with so me semblances of 
norma lcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had 
to admi nister a law from the detail, not 
the [indecipherable] principles
, and people were assigned wo
rk, and were assigned to do 
certain activities. So my brother did work as
 a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically 
wandered around the camp. 
 

Q: Yoursister,too? 

 

A: My sister a little less, I 
think also -- she also did. My  recollection is that, you know, I 
played soccer with a tin can, that was my 
toy, kick the tin can. That was really my 
outdoor activity. This wo ma n, Malka Pollac
zek -- Malka -- ma rried [indecipherable] 
Pollaczek, Malka We inma nn was moved to admi
nister a children™s 
home in relatively 
nice quarters, in fact, was one 
very attractive building that 
they converted to a home for 
children, and she was the admi nistrator for it
. And after she moved 
to that place, she 
found the means to bring me  to that place as well
 if I wanted to, or -- or so. Of course it 
was a little better conditi
on, better food they served, lard as
 part a suppleme nt of the food. 
Where there was [indecipherable] only for child
ren, as we were, loose children at the 
children™s home . And given that we ate koshe
r, we -- I reme mber we had a discussion, 
my brother, my sister and I, whether 
I should go to that home and -- because the 
attraction was eating lard. And so first of all, 
I -- I di -- wasn™t eager to separate anyhow, 
but that [indecipherable] she approached and 
she thinks it™s good 
for me , I™ll be better 
off, nicer physical environment and better food, 
that [indecipherable] my interest,sowe 
consulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahea
d, under the circumstances. Go there and eat 
there, because you have a better chance of 
survival. So in answer to your question, 
whether the food was a mple, it 
really was a consideration fo
r me  to get better food, with 
my interest, or so. So I moved 
to the children™s home  quarters,
 and -- but I did go visit my 
brothers. That was further away from Ha mbor
g caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a 

big courtyard to get from here to there, 
and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt 
like, or  [indecipherable] it is. So I had had 
more space than before, and I did wi -- as a 

functional walk, I didn™t explore the to
wn, or so. So life move d on, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
32 
 
 
 
Q: Can I ask you some thing? 

 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: Since you were religious -- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- and as a kid you understood that -- 

 

A: Mm-h m.  

 

Q: Did it bother you to have the non-kos
her food, I mean that it star -- 
 

A: Yes, yes -- 

 

Q: -- it both -- it bothered 
you when you were -- didn™t -- 
 

A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we
 -- ma ny people who were in these camps, 
although the food was not prepared under kosher au
spices, ate what they could eat, which 
was not -- defi nitively not kosher like. Pig meat if they had given it, or  horsemeat, or this 

sort. So -- and all I could do then, eat th
e horsemeat. I mean, the soup ma y have had 
horsemeat content in there, but it™s -- now a 
lard was definitively food from -- not to be 
eaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, 
so it became  a issue. That™s why I had to -
- we had to debate it, or discuss it. And 
I reme mb er that discussion [indecipherable] no, 
of what should we do, and then we cons
ulted the local rabbi over there, and 

[indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me  a 
ruling that it™s permissible, and I should go, 
and it™s in my interest to do so. So I kne
w enough about that as well, my brothers knew 
more -- my brother knew more, my sist
er  knew more. So it became a legitimate 
discussion issue, but -- 
 

Q: Maybe I didn™t ask the question in a wa
y that was understandable. I meant when you 
actually ate there. 
 

A: Oh. 

 

Q: Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay -- 

 

A: After awhile -- no, afte
r awhile -- but no, after 
awhile it was okay, yes. 
 

Q: -- after it was okay -- it was okay. 

 

A: Yes, I don™t think I had a 
great abhorrence. And most pr
obably kids don™t really know 
what they™re eating anyhow, once it™s served. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477

Q: Right. 
 

A: No, the issue was the underlying principle. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: You know, s o no, that. I™m sorry, that wa
s your question. I did not sense it was, you 
know, just didn™t taste good, or 
th -- I didn™t put up a battle
 subsequently of saying no, I 
don™t, that™s not for me . 
 

Q: No. Did you know that people were 
being transported out of Terezin? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very 
close -- lived. We  were associated very close 
to the transport. Outside there was a big fence,
 a me tal fence, and a ma jor part of the day 
I spent around that fence watching the activity
 of the train depot. A lot of them -- the 
arriva ls I saw. And when the 
arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not 

only I, other people standing 
over there, where they from? Cause sometimes they came 
from towns close by. Or from relatives they 
had, even if they™re from a dif -- different 

country. So that people were identified, and 
the Czech group came in, so the people said, 
oh not for me, I don™t know anybody. Or the Dani
sh came, late at the end of the thing, 
same  story. So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some  you knew, so that 

this came  a discussion point, and people 
tried to see whether they knew anybody. And 
they came from Holland, it was a bi g excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults 

me t acquaintances, or even relatives, and I wa
s part of the -- the watching scenery and 
taking it in, but not -- no -- I had me t 
-- I never me t -- me t anybody who I knew, 
obviously, or anybody who was look -- looking fo
r me . Although subsequently I have to 
me ntion to you, some  dis t ant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had 

contact with them. So the [i
ndecipherable] contact with us
, obviously. Did I know people 
were leaving?  I saw transpor
ts too, but what it meant -- 
you see, two way traffic, all 
right? But the injection of new comi ng -- I di
d sense, of the people with whom I dealt 
with, that they weren™t there any more af
ter awhile. So ther e 
was a [indecipherable] 
whether people ma de friendships or so, it™s di
fferent  -- di fferent  fr
iendships with people 
are there for two months, or three mo nths, 
and fending for themselves, and then they 
disappear. You become  a c quaintance, and then you know somebody™s name , and 

suddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, 
and he is no longer there. I had that sense 
of comi ng, going, people moving 
in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no 
idea. Where they came from was the curiosity 
to be discovered. And in line-ups -- in the 
time of day we had line-ups, the different 
groups lined up near the fences, so that 
conversations started taking place, and 
you started picking up, you know, different 

languages. Danish sing-song, and as a kid st
arted ma king fun, or trying to imitate, and 
learning different phrases from people. But I™d
 never picked up the language, okay?  But 
there as a lot of interact -- not lot, ther
e was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how 
long it took to wait, and we sa
w diffe rent nationalities, and 
different languages, and kind 
of ca me  [indecipherable] curious what wa
s going on. So there was more -- I think the 
arrivals left  a bigger impact
 on me  than the departures, because I had no idea where 
people are going. I knew where they came from
. And you -- suddenly you sit next to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
34 
 
 
Danes, and you sit next to the Hungarians wh
en they came at the end. But we were not 
allowed to mi x, and we  -- there really was a fence between the nationa lities, unless they 
put them in the same caserne. So I became 
more a ware of the change of population of 
Westerbork over time, but the imme diate group 
of people whom -- who I deal with, my 
brother and my sister, Malk
a We inmann and her husband, mi dw
ay were shipped out to 
Auschwitz, cause she wa s more Dut c h, and he was more -- he was Czech originally. So 

they categorized him, he came under her 
auspices, and she had other potential 

[indecipherable] I™m not clear why she survive
d, but she did. Anyway, th
at part I -- that 
one part of the mi ddle of our stay, he was sh
ipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of 
have a image of her being sad for one period 
of there, but could ha
ve been anything, or 
so, but later on she told me  
it was -- what was happening. 
 

Q: I have to change the tape. 

 

A: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 

 

End of Tape #3 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
35 
 
 
Tape #4 
 
Q: Okay. There was some  -- some thing called 
the helping hand in Terezin, where children 
were sent around to help out with the sick, 
or with the elderly. Do you ever reme mber 
anything like -- cause some bo --  
 

A: I was not, because I was in the children™s -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh,section. 

 

A: Section, or that little, special children™s 
home. And my brother most probably was, when 
he was -- was a me ssenger, that was a helping hand. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: So he was doing -- delivering me ssages for di
fferent people, Leo Baeck for example, he 
did -- he ran me ssages for Leo Baeck, who -- he was a inma te -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- in Terezi n. 

 

Q: Did you ever hear the name  
Freddie Hirsch, who worked wi
th children there, or not? 
 

A: Nope, no, no. 

 
Q: No. So ma ybe he didn™
t work with little ones. 
 
A: No -- little ones, right. No, the -- 
when wa -- which year was he there? 
 

Q: He was -- well, he was -- I believ
e he was sent to Auschwitz in ™44.  
 

A: Okay, so -- 

 

Q: Ithink. 

 

A: That™s o -- that was before -- 

 

Q: Before you came, right, right. 

 

A: [indecipherable] came. See, there was a 
whole group of people who -- particularly the 
Czech young people who lived in some  of these 
children™s ho mes, they were arriving, I 
think, in ™43, and then they we
re sent out to Auschwitz -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
36 
 
 
A: -- elsewhere, in end of ™43, and ™44. 
 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

A: So, a lot of people ask me , do you know
 these people, or those people -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- I never was even the same time with them. 

 

Q: Time  with them, right. I™m not sure exactly when he was -- 

 

A: Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, ™44, likely. 

 

Q: Did you ever get sick? 
 
A: Good question. No. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: Re ma rkably, rema rkably, no.  

 

Q: Cause one would think as a kid, right? 

 

A: And -- exactly, as a kid, and my brother a
nd sister neither. I ma y have be en, you know, 
colds or this sort, but in terms of illne
ss, like dysentery, or typhus, which was -- 
 

Q: Typhus,right. 

 

A: -- going on, given that lice and bugs were ar
ound me , no, I was spared. Re ma rkable that I 
didn™t -- 
 

Q: Amazing. 

 

A: All three of us. I asked my brother recently 
again, any of us were serious ill. In fact, one 
question which occurred to me , whic h I don™t 
know why I started school in 1942, when I 

was seven, whether that was the norm in Ho
lland or not. So my brother didn™t know 

exactly, but he says, when you were a ch
ild, you had frequent whooping cough, so ma ybe 
our parents protected you more 
or so. I suspect that
 the schools start at the age of seven, 
and we™ve had an extended kindergarten. Th
e schools don™t always 
start that early -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

 

A: -- in -- in -- in Europe or so. But anyhow
, we talked about that, and to our pleasant 
surprises, we  were not sick of physi
cal si -- illness, you know, I mean, requiring 
infirmary, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
37 
 
 
 
Q: And did you see -- 

 

A: Did I see people sick? Again the pe -- 

 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

A: -- the wa -- the small group of people I menti
on -- mention my  circle
 of contacts became  
very small. I lived with children, and she took -- Malka We inma nn took c a re of me , a nd I 

me t my brot her and sister, that was basically my circle. 
 

Q: So really very small. 

 

A: So plus ma  - -  the -- when I went up to th
ese little study places. That
 was standard, and co 
-- and again the turnove
r of people was such. So [indeci
pherable] when a person became  
sick or -- was shipped out. You -- people di
dn™t have a tracing -- if you have an ongoing 
relationship with a know -- fellow, friend or ac-a
cquaintance, and is -- is there, for no -- 
three, four months, and disappears for two 
mont hs, and comes back after three months. 
The bulk of people who didn™t co
me back, didn™t come back. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Whether they were sick, or in -- or we ns
h -- went elsewhere, di-didn™t know, penetrated, 
and I wasn™t focusing attention on this kind 
of thing. But personall
y, rema rkably enough 
we didn™t get sick, not in We sterbork, not in -- 
 
Q: Not in Terezin. 
 

A: NotTerezin. 

 

Q: It™samazing. 

 

A: It™s amazing, absolutely amazing.  

 

Q: Really amazing.  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you get ho -- how do you be -- how were you trea
ted -- as a little child there™s a lot of 
touching that goes on with ch
ildren, being hugged, and being 
touched, and whatever. Di -
- did you get that?  Do you reme mber ? 
 

A: I received that fr om Malka Weinmann. 

 

Q: Youdid? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
38 
 
 
A: Yes. She was attentive to me
, and ma tter of fact she took me  
into the -- her orbit, direct 
orbit. I perce -- now, I was paid attention, I 
had access to her, and va
guely I recall once or 
twice, and I came to her with 
some  kind of compl a int or so, and soothed my feelings or 
so. So I had that, it was not the -- she had a lot 
of children to take ca
re of, and she was not 
-- in general she™s not a touchy -- was not 
a touchy person, was a very professional 
woma n, very capable, and very caring. But 
to go and, you know, hug every little child 
under her care, she couldn™t 
probably do her job, or -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- or so. So I, did I lack that?  Most proba
bly I -- I -- did I mi ss it
?  Again, I di -- those -- 
those were my circumsta -- I mean, I wa
s both accepting, and not knowing any better. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Okay. I just -- I appear to have adjust ed to
 the circumstances, and I moved with the tide.  
 

Q: Right. Whic h was lucky, I suppose. 

 

A: Which was lucky, yes. 

 

Q: Ho -- how would you describe your relations
hip with Leah, and with Leo?  Did you talk, 
did you play? 
 

A: We talked, no, we were in conta -- I ta -- 
I me ntioned I c-come -- gravitated back to them 
-- 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: -- or so. We  were a threesome, okay?  And related to each ot her. One illustration, which in 
fact is under, quote, dispute amongst us, and 
both stories ma y well be correct, by the way, 
because what we each reme mber is so me thing different. For -- my recollection of the 

story is that for Passover, for Pessach, fo
r the Seder time, we knew that Passover is 
comi ng around, cause we™re taught in the group, we
 -- Leo and I --that™s -- I recall, my 
brother confirms that after I recall it, 
saved our potato rations, and we ground it up 
somehow, and gave it to her to make ma
tzoh. She does not recall that. She recalls 
some thing different, that Leo and I saved our 
potato rations and ma de a birthday cake for 
her. And I say both ma y well be right. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Okay, we don™t know. 

 

Q: Or you ma y be talking about
 two different time s even. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
39 
 
 
A: Or two different times even, 
or so. But that™s the kind we 
-- and we dealt with each other 
as a li -- if you ask me  a s  a illustration, we
ll, we came -- she was -- kind of took care of 
the household things. 
 
Q: Leahdid. 

 

A: Le -- yeah, li -- 
li -- call her Lily.  
 

Q: Lily? 

 

A: Lily. That™s her other -- that™s her -- that™s
 her name  we know of her -- Leah is her formal 
name , and now in Israel she™s -- calls herself 
Leah as well to other pe
ople, but Lily is her 
-- 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: -- common name, mean, as a family, 
people know Lily. But so we had ongoing, you 
know, relationships, and contact. And most pr
obably played whatever children play. But 
she again had her tasks, and my brother had 
his tasks, and I was separated from the m.  
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: So the amount of contact was not as freque
nt and as ongoing as had we
 been all together.  
 

Q: Now I -- I know that you -- you 
didn™t feel insecure in the wa
y that an adult would there. 
 
A: No. 
 

Q: This was the place that you were at. But 
did you feel somehow more secure, more at 
home  when you™d be with your brother and si
ster, that sa -- you -- do you have this -- 
 

A: The mere fa ct that  I gr avitated to them -- 

 

Q: Towardsthem.  

 

A: -- yes, obviously is the case, that I fe
lt that was the know, -- I 
belonged with them -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and they could answer my questions, or d
eal with me , or whatever concerns I ma y have 
had, don™t recall the individual po
int, but I do recall walking regularly from the children™s 
home , which is separate building, to the 
caserne, and looking for them, and getting -- 
moving with them. So where th
at was, know, a stabilizing feature for me , or not, in the 
likely, yes. But as a child I certainly don™t 
recall that I was looking for, you know, a place 
where I had to be safe, and only with them
 or anybody else. So me how I managed to roam 
the streets, keep busy, the day passes, get my
 food, and do my things what I had to do, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
40 
 
 
and keep out of trouble, whatever that mean
t, and function. That was my -- that was my 
daily routine. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And I did that day by day, with some guida
nce, with some  s upervision. But I don™t think 
it™s as structured, as organized as peopl
e would like to see in retrospect -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- that  it was all or chestr
ated. That™s how it worked out. 
 

Q: Now, how were your clothes washed, 
if they were washed?  Do you -- do you know? 
 

A: I think my sister did some of it, 
and they washed infrequently, obviously. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Must -- things must have torn. Ag
ain, the whole clothing for all of us -- 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: -- is not clear. I say -- I may have be en th
e benefi ciary again of my brothers, but how my 
brother kept clothing, how 
I got it, he doesn™t know either. But it happened.  
 

Q: Right. 
 
A: And they -- they were wa shed, and the to
tal clothing collection, which was probably very 
meager, and I don™t recall what I 
wore, I don™t recall the 
colors or pa
tterns, or of this sort. 
Left no impr ession that I didn™t have or did 
have. I wa -- I was taken care of because I 

was dressed. I wasn™t walking around na
ked, or no -- barefoot. And again, Malka 
Weinma nn ma y well have supervised that part 
for me  too. So, in broad sense, my ne eds 
were taken care of. As know
, to survive to function.  
 

Q: Did you wash, did you take baths? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Did you sme l l? 

 

A: Showers. 

 

Q: You took showers? 

 

A: I think I took showers. I think I took show
ers, yes [indecipherable] there was no bathtubs. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
41 
 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: I think I took showers. 
Did I smell? The whole -- 
 

Q: Everybodysmelled. 

 

A: Everybody, the whole place had a aroma, odor.  

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Heavy, and so they came -- and eventu
ally people got used to that. So -- 
 

Q: And bathrooms? Were there latrines? 

 

A: There were latrines, and pub
lic long -- long line bathrooms 
or so. Again, all these things 
don™t leave any impression on me , because it beca
me  routine. Whatever facilities were 
there, I ma de use of. 
 

Q: You just [indecipherable] 

 

A: Right. Whet her they were foul comp ared to
 what could have been, obviously. But pose -- 
mean -- remember, for a little child in ™44, th
e last time I had normal bathroom facilities, 
was go back in end of ™42, begi
nning of ™43, it™s a long time .  
 

Q: Right. 

 
A: After, I know, two years of not standard sani
tary conditions, that become s, in some  sense, 
the accepted norm.  
 
Q: Now was that simila
r in Westerbork for you? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: It was?  They had latrines? 

 

A: Yes, yes, right. But it -- nothing to leave any 
kind of me ntal picture 
of it. When I visited 
Terezin, I saw in some  of the places what th
ey had, I kind of recollect on all these long 

lines. But only kind of re-eme rged some th
ing ote -- which I took f -- that was it -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- that™s -- that™s how one ha
d to go to take care of one™s needs, one took care of one™s 
needs using what was availabl e. 
 

Q: And your recollection of the way people beha
ved is people were simp
ly accepting, this is 
what was there, and this 
is what we have to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
42 
 
 
 
Q: Well, that™s -- that ™s what  I her -- saw at
 yet -- but again, doesn™t mean that was all -- 
always the case, but I was not 
involved with adult world t
oo much. And the adult world I 
was involved in dealt with me  as a child. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: So I am not a person that could kind of 
comment anything about th
at sort of thing.  
 

Q: Did you ever ask your brother, ha
ve you heard from our
 parents again? 
 

A: Not far as I recall. 

 

Q: Not as you recall. 

 

A: Recall,no 

 

Q: Or did you say wh-where are they? 

 

A: Where -- ask -- no, I don™t recal
l that I raised this issue, 
whether it was on my mi nd. And 
part again is I think eventually
 I moved fr om transition to transition to a life circumstance 

that was tolerable for a chil
d. And again, I was not being hu
rt physically, I was not being 
-- didn™t get sick or so. So I was not in pai
n, or some  of this sort. May have cold, but 
everybody else was cold most probably, so
 it™s cold. And some how was accepting, 
adapting to it, and so stopped asking questi
ons. My brother was much more alert, and 
much more troubled about all of this, but either
 protected me , or didn™t consider me  as an 
outlet. I have no idea where he [indecipherable]
 outlet for that matter. He may -- needed 
outlet more than I did, my brother.  
 

Q: So in some  way your youth protected you. 

 

A: My youth protected me  -- 

 

Q: Every[indecipherable] 

 

A: -- and this way my youth was treated with th
is -- these little -- 
being in these little 
children™s enclaves, and childre
n™s home s kind of protected me
 one layer better than my 
siblings did. I was more privileged treatme nt 
in some  sense, than they had. He had to 
work and fend for himse l f, and I was in this children™s home. And it -- physically a more 

attractive place, I reme mber that, physically wa
s with a balustrade stairway -- cour se th-
they took over a residential home, that™s how th
 -- that™s how they were built. I think -- 
 

Q: Was [indecipherable] sa -- I™m sorry, go on. 

 

A: -- no -- go ahead -- those -- no -- since it was 
an army ca mp before, and it was good as an 
army camp, the commandanters, or  the comman
ders, and all this so
rt had si -- elegant 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
43 
 
 
home s, and that™s where they eventually put
 the children. Right now the museum is in 
one of those buildings, very eleg
ant room. El -- elegant st  -- 
 
Q: And did you reme mber -- 

 

A: The physical building? 

 

Q: -- the physical building very well? 

 

A: Oh, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: In fact, when I went to the museum, I t
hought it was -- that was th
e place where I wa s, 
because very similar stairway, and spatial. 
So, I mean, I -- I was not
 in no -- in total 
squalid quarters
, fortunately. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: My brother and sister in
 the bunkbed areas were worse,
 I was there for awhile, I 
reme mber that, but you know, took it, and I move
d onto another stage. I wa s very kind of 
-- not -- not in control of things, nor was 
I asking to be in control of things.  
 

Q: Right. Did your sister also eventually work? 

 

A: I believe she did some  work, I don™t recall exactly, no. 
 
Q: You don™t know what, right. 

 

A: [inaudible] 

 

Q: Was there any delousing that you can reme mbe r , where they put powder on you, or 
something?  
 

A: I think there was delousing, we got chem
icals odors periodically, was when the bugs and 
lice became more prevalent, they had delousing, yes. Then, that ma de life uncomfortable 

on your bed as well, because had 
the odor and the 
residual -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- fu -- features, or so, the only f
eature was you saw dead bugs. I don™t like bugs. 
 

Q: Do you remember being deloused? 

 

A: Personally, I think on
ce or twice, yes I --  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
44 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh, did that hurt, I mean wa
s it -- was it burning or some -- 
 
A: I don™t think no, no -- 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: -- I don™t -- I recall as --no, I don™t recall the physical part 
of it. But I think the physical, 
the barracks themselves were deloused.  
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: Cause that™s where they -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- that™s where the lice were prevalent. 

 

Q: Were,right. 

 

A: So, sure that™s not -- not pleasant or so. 
But it can it -- it came, and it went, and it came  
again, perhaps. And that was 
part of the environment.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So not some thing to kind of leave a impact, or a imprint on me. 

 
Q: Right. 
 

A: As it would ma ybe on an adult, or a -- I wa
sn™t fighting it either
, you see, it wasn™t a 
question that I wanted some
thing better or different. 
 

Q: It -- in June of 1944, the Red Cross came, 
and they ma de this a lot -- certain portion of 
the place look much, mu ch different, and they
 call it a kind of pot
enkin viz -- village, 
because it was a -- a lie. Do you have 
any recollection of that happening? 
 

A: No. Partly I think -- you see,
 we arrived in end of February, and we were not veterans at 
the time, this -- the -- these 
were planned, you know. June they came, but they planned it 
in advance. So all the pe -- 
the kids who they put in the 
kid shows, and the other items 
were the fronts for the -- and props for these movies, must have been picked ma ybe 

March and April. I mean, you don™t -- you don™t do 
this stuff in June on June. So we kind 
of -- most probably came too late for that, so 
we were out of it. I don™t recall any of this 
thing of a sort. 
 

Q: Nothing,uh-huh. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477

A: And I think I would have, had I seen a play 
or a s -- a soccer ma tch, or some thing -- this 
was -- that™s wha -- done the movie. I -- had I been one of the props -- 
 
Q: Right, you would have reme mbered. 

 

A: -- I™d have reme mbered some thing. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And I think my brother neither. But I attrib
ut ed that fact that we arrived when the 
planning for this thing -- this must have 
been underway already, and we were out of 
eligibility -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- for that kind of thing, so nor did we  get 
the benefits, whatever be
nefits existed for the 
clean up of this sort. 
 

Q: Right, right. Di -- did you go to any cultu
ral activities during the period of time you were 
in t -- Terezin? 
 

A: No, only this little kids, you know, st
udy group, that™s the 
cultural activity.  
 

Q: That was it. 

 

A: We did have my brother™s bar-mitzvah. 
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Oh yes. That™s where the canned item -- 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- I me ntioned to you, in f -- January, 1945 was his bar-mitzvah, and he was taught by 
one of the rabbis to read the 
section of the Haftorah, and be called up to the Torah, and 
Friday night had a festive celebration wher e Malka We inma nn pulled out that can of 

cheese, Dutch cheese. 
 

Q: Oh, that™s what it was. 

 

A: That which she saved for that event. And 
she collected from other people some  goodies 
they had, chocolates and everything else. So it
 was a festive event. We  did go to services, 
to synagogue on a weekly basis. 
 

Q: Oh, you did? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
46 
 
 
A: Oh yes, was a synagogue service going on and 
so we were part of that little group of 
people who went to services. And in fact my
 brother recently showed me  that they had 
announceme nt sheets, they -- the person who wa
s organizing that service send out an 
announceme nt to some body else, be aware that next
 week or some  of this sort, is the bar-
mitzvah celebration of this young boy, Leo Sigmann, and ma ke, know, announce it to 
whoever it is, that will take 
place on Saturday morning. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And he has it? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: He has one of them?  

 

A: Well, by chance my brother, a complete 
fluke chance, he was walking home  from 
synagogue with some  of his congregants in 
New York, and a fellow invited him come  up 
have -- have guests, and he didn™t want to 
come  up, and he did come  up, a nd eventually 
the person had inherited the diary -- had the 
-- all these announcements of the Jewish 
community of Terezin, he had all of them, 
and he -- when he -- Leo me ntioned to him 
that he was in Terezin, didn™t 
register. When he went back 
to it, he went looking through 
all these little notices, 
and he says, your name  is liste
d in among those notices. I have a 
copy of it here with me . 
 
Q: Is-Isn™t that something? 
 

A: And so they have [indecipherable] the f
act that he gave him a composite sheet of 
different notices, which is just
 interesting enough that they ha
d the -- there was a sense of 
community, and belonging with different people. 
So that celebration 
I recall, and the can 
-- the can of cheese which she saved. 
 

Q: Was it good cheese? 

 

A: Yes, well, Dutch. Dutch cheese is good. A
nd other treats for -- even if you don™t have -- 
don™t have treats on a ro
utine basis, it tastes very different. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: That was the highlight of summer event. 
So it was not just the bar-mitzvah which most 
probably, wa s also being comme mo rated wa
s -- was [indecipherable] so people did 
continue doing their lifecycle ev
ents, or so, and what™s even 
more interesting in his case, 
is that bar-mitzvah boys rece
ived tefillin, but where do you get tefillin in a camp?  People 
happened to have one set, not going to give 
it away, necessa rily. Turns out that a Czech 
person had two sets. One a traveling set, was 
this regular one, which he brought along, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
47 
 
 
he gave it to my brother. Very, very small phylacteries. And typical
ly, the ins -- writings 
inside the tefillin ar e in parchment, and the very small ones had to write very small 
letters. Typically, typically they are defective.
 It turns out that he 
had them inspected by a 
scribe, after -- he has them now
, he had them inspected by a sc
ribe after the war, in New 
York, or -- or in Israel for that ma tter, and they were letter perfect. 
 

Q: Veryodd. 

 

A: And the ma n was overwhelmed. And he told
 them where he came from [indecipherable] 
some body™s been protecting it, or 
so. So he still has those. 
 

Q: Oh my. But we -- these small --  

 

A: Very tiny, very small ones. 

 

Q: Huh.Amazi ng. 

 

A: So life on -- this respect for life on re
ligious sense went on, circumscribed by the 
circumstances. 
 

Q: Did a lot of people go to synagogue? There 
must have been different synagogue groups, 
always.  
 

A: Different [indecipherable] I can -- I would not
 know -- can™t  -- the totality I can™t tell. We 
had a synagogue -- well, a synagogue, a serv
ice place, it was an ongoing place, and we  
went regularly. So all these places were 
relatively small physic
al space anyhow -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- so they couldn™t crowd ma ny people in. 

 

Q: Right. And your sist
er went as well? 
 

A: I believe so. I believe so. Yes, I can™t
 -- you know, but -- but it was ca -- it was an 
activity, you know, we know Shabbat 
came, that -- that™s what you do. 
 

Q: And that was what -- right. And you 
celebrated as ma ny holidays as you could? 
 

A: We celebrated, because again we were taugh
t of the holiday cycle, so we celebrated, 
commemorated with -- within
 what we could, whether 
-- the one -- one episode I 
reme mber was about the matzoh making, okay? 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: But whether -- I don™t recall 
a, you know, full fledged Seder, or so, myself, in detail, but 
it must have occurred. Or a -- a Seder must ha
ve occurred, right?  So again I have these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
48 
 
 
little glimpses, of course that
 one left an impression to me , that we did some thing, you 
know, special. But the -- you know, s-some  se
mblance of the calendar comme moration 
continued.  
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: Part because of the education, 
and part because of the practice. 
 

Q: Now, this visa that you had to Honduras
, but there was some t hing about going to 
Switzerland, am I co
rrect, that you -- 
 

A: Du -- the n -- no, there were they -- the 
visas were for Honduras, provided by our Swiss 
relatives. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: My s -- mother had a si st er and br others in Zuri ch, and they are the ones who mobilized -
- 
 

Q: To get the visas. 

 

A: -- to get those visas. But 
nat -- I believe at my fat her™s behest, know, been begging and -- 
but -- and it came too late for my parents 
and two older brothers. So it had a Swiss 
association with it, but it™s Honduran passports. 
 

Q: I see. Okay. 
 
A: That kept us in this categ
ory of treat them differently.  
 

Q: And that seemed to protect you throu
ghout the whole period. So
me -- or something 
protected you. 
 

A: That of -- protect us from the -- of course
, in Theresienstadt they
 had ongoing transports 
to Auschwitz as well, and Bergen-Belsen, and el
sewhere. So we were never put in any of 
the transports, because of that status, not b
ecause  we were children, because  they didn™t 
differentiate, they put the children on there as 
well, plenty of them. But, at the end of the 
war they had already in I thi
nk the fall of ™44, they had afte
r this propaganda episode, the 
Red Cross again had a deal with the Swiss 
people [indecipherable] 
Swiss authorities had 
a deal for transporting people to stu -- Switzerland in exchange for trucks and tools, who 

knows what. And money, I think. So, a number of
 people were eligible to go, and rumo rs 
spread, or evers know, spread that pi -- th
at this was happening, people ought to be 
signing up. And they had certain categories pe
ople who were eligib
le, and we cate -- 
under our categories we [indecipherable] becau
se we had Swiss relatives ma ybe they 
thought my par -- my mother lives there, w
ho knows what. Anyway, we re eligible to go, 

and we were -- kind of suggested we couldgo. So we consulted with different people, 

including these other relativ
es of my  mother, which wa
s -- and there was a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
49 
 
 
suspicion, and our name  was not
 put on that train. Must ha
ve been in the fall of ™44. 
People had arrangeme nts, see th -- whoever 
was suspicious ha d ar
rangement of giving 
back ma ilings with codes of -- if
 it is correct, they write --  so
me  words, or some  style, or 
what have you. If it™s not co
rrect, they would do some thing different. Wh en the letters 
came back, they actually came from Swit
zerland, the packages were sent from 
Switzerland, so that train of, I think 11 -- 
1200 people left, and I -- my brother and sister 
could have been on that train, but we mi ssed the bo -- train. 
 
Q: You mi ssed the boat. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: But subsequently, they had similar types of announcements, and some  the -- some  went 
actually to Auschwitz di rectly. They were to
ld they™re going some where else. We  we re 
not eld -- we -- eligible because [indecipherable]
 workers, had to be of working age, at 
least I wasn™t, and so we™re not eligible. But 
in ™45, there was anot
her opportunity if you 
were going to Swiss tr -- [i
ndecipherable] or -- or Freedom
 train, and for that one we 
were eligible, and we did sign up. Now, that 
train never left, but ne -- wer -- there -- was 
destined to go to a gas chamber. Many peopl
e don™t know that, Ther
esienstadt had a gas 
chamber, but Terezin does -- fortunately it was 
never used, cause they wa nted to save the 
travel time  and distance of the 
trains, for that time they wanted to use the trains for their 
own war purposes, or [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Did you hear about that then? 
 
A: What, about the train goi
ng to tre -- to gas chambers? 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: After the war we discovered. 

 

Q: No, I mean, that there -- that they were 
supposed to be building the gas chamber, and -- 
 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no. 

 

Q: You didn™t. This you heard after the war. 

 

A: Yes, that™s true [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: But that train never left, because the war is 
comi ng to it™s end, but that -- the plan of the 
Nazis was to have that train go to the -- ve
ry close by. And it was th
 -- but the foil was, 
let™s say, the Swiss Freedom train. So
 we were saved once mo re by -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
50 
 
 
 
Q: Right. There was a train to Switzer
land in 1945 with about 1200 people -- 
 

A: Ithink™44. 

 

Q: -- from Terezin. There ma y have been one -- 

 

A: May -- may -- maybe jan -- maybe January, Fe
bruary, could be. That
™s the one we were 
not. 
 

Q: I see, that wa s one -- 

 

A: Which means that we did not sign on. 

 

Q: I see, right. 

 

A: I don™t know the dates exactly. 

 

Q: Right. Okay. We  have to take a break. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Sorry th --

Q: Charles, do you -- you were liberated in Ma
y, and you didn™t take th
is second -- or at 
least we think it ma y be the s
econd transport to -- to Switzerland. That was going to go in 
March or April, you think? 
 

A: Around that time, yes. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. So is -- is anything ch -- 

 

A: That was an aborted trip, it 
never -- that never took off. 
 

Q: It never took off, so no one went on it. 

 

A: Exactly. 

 

Q: Did anything change radically in -- in  those few months before the liberation? 

 

A :  We l l  y e s ,  t h e r e  w a s  mu c h  mo r e  mo v e me n t
 of trains, and so much more activity. 
 

Q: You mean in and out? 

 

A: In and out, yeah, right. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 
A: And towards the end of the war -- and I lo
se -- I™d -- nobody -- I mean, 
I still didn™t know 
the calendar date, whether was mar -- Februa
ry, March, to me  it was the winter, who 
knows, but I don™t associate with particular m
onths or dates. But towards the end, since I 
hung around that fence at the -- near th -- near
 the railroad, wa tchi ng the railroad tracks 
on one side, and the movement of activity on 
the other side, there were ki -- more and 
more people were standing around, and they 
were kind of comi ng instant war reporting 
commentators, because by the sound of where cer
tain cannons went off, or airplanes were 
flying, they were able to tell, or
 the -- they thought they coul
d tell whether it™s the allied 
forces or whether they we re the Germans. And 
as a standee next to that fence, I was kind 
of comi ng -- hearing about, know, the forces ag
ainst the Nazis are comi ng closer to here. 
And that came -- gave momentum as the da
ys increased, whether -- was -- must have 
been April I assume, or so, but I can tell.
 Also we saw German
 trucks moving out 
different kind of Ger man soldiers, w-we ha
d [indecipherable] with the German soldiers, 
but there was more moveme nt of pe ople [i
ndecipherable] going and 
-- and kind of what 
you found out after that they
 were regrouping and escapi
ng. And more people were 
hanging around that fence rather than worki
ng, wherever they was doing. So there was a 

very different atmosphere towards the end of
 the war than before. That was the most 
noticeable part, and this -- listening to thes
e comme nts of -- they™re comi ng, they™re not, 

they™re further away, closer by, and judging of 
a sort, I got a sense that -- wh -- since I 
then knew right -- it was a war, everything else
, that this war is now reaching a different 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
52 
 
 
stage. So that was very much in the atmos
phere, in the air, and the conversation, and I 
was there listening -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and absorbing, and most probably even 
parroting what was ha
ppening. Different kinds 
of transports came the end, I think the Danes 
and the Hungarians came  pretty late in the 
game . And -- kind of -- so new people, you neve
r heard -- you -- heard before. The Danes 

came very late. So new languages, but the -- 
and they were different appearance, too. 
Now, turns out that Theresienstadt also 
got a whole group of people from the death 
ma rches, were -- ended up in Theresienstadt, 
but they never ended up to our place, they 
ended up in -- that™s why people ask me  about
, do you ever meet those people, no. Matter 
of fact, I know now some people who says they
 were in Theresiensta
dt at liberation. And 
their description of what they saw was very di
fferent than what I lived. But they lived in 
the small compound, away from whe r e 
we were anyhow -- not that -- not 
[indecipherable] I™ve seen everybody, but I w
ould have [indecipherable] I seen comi ng 
in, I would have seen very different type 
of person comi ng in, straggling in, decima ted 
people. We  didn™t see those people, alt
hough we were liberated the same  day -- 
 

Q: Sa me day. 

 

A: -- or so. So anyway, the momentum t hat™s
 -- the scene was cha
nging, the war scene was 
changing was evident, and was part of the 
discussion. And that I do recall being there, 
participating, absorbing. On again, on a daily, 
incremental basis. By the end of it, you 
know what was happening. And I recall the fina
l days or so where the troops of the 
German Nazis were leaving, and for good luck 
threw hand grenades over the fence for us, 
for now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on. Bu
t that™s already before
 we got it, that™s 
a good sign, because they™re good-bye, and good 
riddance. So that was the approa ch 
towards the end of the war which changed th
e mo od. I think a lot of people -- and again I 
capture that indirectly being 
-- being there. Right,
 I know exactly the details of what was 
happening.  
 

Q: I -- I just -- as you were ta
lking I realized that
 I didn™t -- I didn™t ask you when did you 
realize there was a war going on? 
 

A: In-- 

 

Q: Was it very late? 
 
A: Late, yes. In ter --  in tere -- 

 

Q: It was pretty late?  

 

A: 1944. 

 

Q: InTheresiens tadt? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
53 
 
 
 
A: In Terezin, yes, yes. 

 

Q: And-- 

 

A: But part of it see, as I grew older and stood 
in that fence, that fence was a -- a part of my 
activity. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Right?  And that™s y-you hear 
people talking. You overhear, so
 at -- at ™44, when I was 
eight plus, I was kind of understa
nding a little bit more about 
war, sides, Nazis, Germany, 
others. People in -- when they lined up, 
and they had different -- [indecipherable] I 
overheard conversations, but I was part of it, 
eventually starts some  [indecipherable] so I 
understood there was a war, and the Jews were
 targets and victims, because obviously we 
were -- most of them were Jews, okay?  
And I hung around s -- the synagogues, so -- 
 

Q: You hear a lot. 

 

A: You hear -- hear this kind
 of s-story. Whether I knew a
ll the sophisticated details -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- or not -- that™s irreleva
nt, but I knew there was a war,
 and I knew things were now 
suddenly being changed. One side was losing, 
one side is gaining. What it meant being, 
you know, who da -- who decides where -- obvious
ly I was not fully in command of that, 
whether it was allied troops, or even the name
s of it, but that -- but there was a -- the 
Nazis, or the Germans, basically, versus ot
her people, and that th
ere™s a battle going on, 
and you know, you heard these reports about th
e airplanes flying, and sounds of bangs 
and booms, and people interpreting all of that, 
I -- I started ab-absorbing that, over time. 
It wasn™t a one day event either, reme mber -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- it was several weeks of time. And I -- ag
ain, the fact there were more people at the 
fence than before, I didn™t know why, but it wa
s a changed feature a-as well. So that™s 
how I kind of participated in 
the approach of liberation. 
 

Q: When you started learning mo
re, realizing that there™s a 
war, and hearing the guns, and 
some body s a ying that the Nazis are doing things to the Jews -- wh -- however you heard 

it, did you start getting 
afraid then, or -- 
 

A: No, it came in a good time, because it was th -- 

 

Q: Because it was at the end?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
54 
 
 
A: It was the end, and people are saying 
we™re winning, or you know, we™re going to be 
freed. 
 
Q: Isee. 

 

A: So-- 

 

Q: So no -- no time  for fear. 

 

A: Well, not no time for fea r , just not -- wa
s again, was n-not the highlight of what I was 
kind of taking in. I was taking in about some  
war , and one side is going to lose, and these 
guys are going to get it, and they™re leavi
ng, walking away -- way -- when people saw 
these trucks, or whatever it was, with [i
ndecipherable] Germa n soldiers running, the 
commentary was they™re surrendering, they™re escaping, they™re doi
ng some thing. Well, 

then you sense that these people, the bad 
people are going out of your life, you know?  It 
was not that dif -- kind of fear more than ha
d it occurred in ™43, or
 ™44, when it was the 

[indecipherable]  
 

Q: Now, is there a period of time between wh
en the Germans leave, and the Russians come, 
when it™s just all of you inma tes in Te rezin? 
 

A: There was a short period, but again, only -- 

 

Q: Not in -- 

 

A: Not -- not -- again, it wasn™t
 identified to me  as a new pe
riod of, know, freedom or so. I 
only sensed it by the number 
of people at that fence. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: That was growing, growing, more peopl
e were there. Peopl
e hanging around. And you 
hear this [indecipherable] you know, we bei
ng -- going to be fr eed. You understood what 
was happening, that end was comi ng. And then, see these ma s s, you know, departures, it 

also was consistent . So now the people -- question of when will [i ndecipherable] people 

most probably listen to some  ki
nd of radio or other features, 
then they -- that™s -- word 
spread amongst each ot her. I was obviously no
t party to that. And -- but it sounded more 
real that what other people 
were talking about, and I kind of
 integrated that into my 
absorption, whatever I was thinking. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: You have to re-recollect that
 when I child hears things, it is
 not all as logical as what ™s 
being presented, or as totally comprehensible. 
But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone, 
a change of discussion topics, a
nd that™s what I was capturing. 
 

Q: Right. Did food change? Did you still ge 
-- you still ate in the 
way you had before?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
55 
 
 
 
A: Sa me . 

 

Q: Sa me . 

 

A: As far as I™m aware, the same . Not aware of any change. 

 

Q: Any change in that way. 

 

A: No, no.  

 

Q: Do you remember the Russians when they came? 

 

A: Ohyes. 

 

Q: What was it like? 

 

A: First of all, they came and obviously 
jubilant, you know. Wa s a -- and the people 
themselves were kind of very excited and th
ey handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and 
chocolates to people, I think to
 us, to kids, and in that resp
ect they were very, quote, kind, 
and a breath of fresh air. Right
? Soldiers who were fr iendly rather than soldiers who were 
guarding people who -- and people embraced them
, and touched them, it was a different -
- you saw that some  wha t ever it was, new -- liberat
ors, but that™s what 
-- that™s what they 
left the impr ession. In that re
spect they were mos t  pr --
 most probably very good. I did 
know, and I can see that image too, of ra mpag
ing through the barrack 
to the caserne of 
the -- you know, where people were crowded, 
and ripping off watches of wome n. I saw 
that scene, apparently they also pillaged a
nd raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not 
obviously, but I just didn™t see, or didn™t 
know what™s happening. Th
at™s later, but the 
grabbing off watches of people who some how 
managed to retain them during the war 
period is -- was very kind of shocking to me . 
But  they di -- transfor
med very quickly, the 
role of the being behind the fences versus 
being free, and more move me nt . I think the 
fence came down, or -- but we still had a fe
nce, I reme mber was the -- suddenly you saw 
the German soldiers, whoever 
the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in 
Theresienstadt were now being required to
 go with wheelbarrows and picking things up, 
and fixing things up, and breaking things dow
n, and they were being beaten by some  
for mer German people who ta -- trying to put 
-- change their roles in order to get mo re 
privileges, and that was going on and pe
ople were cheering on and pointing out, you 
know, hit them harder, etcetera, 
this sort, get even with them. So the -- again, that was a 
very different atmosphere what you saw before
. So that™s the Russians kind of influence, 
a very quick turnaround of the ones who were 
doing the Nazi work before, and now they 
became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little 
surprisi ng to see these other naz -- Nazis, 
or Germans, and Germa ns beating up their comp
atriots, or so, and with full vigor, I me an, 

just reversed direction. But that -- the tr
ansition from being occupied versus being 
liberated, and the change took [indecipherable]
 very, very quickly. And very noticeable, 
and to -- very quick. Now in May, the eight
h, ninth, we were lib
erated, and by June 
already we were out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
56 
 
 
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Now, a lot of people didn™t ma ke it to late
r. There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a 
quarantine, but the most typhus epidemic t
ook place in that ot her quarter where these 
other people who were in the death ma rche
s who ma de it, barely ma de it, ended up. I 
don™t know whether in our particular compound, th
ey did it by caserne to caserne, I don™t 
know what -- we were allowed to leave in
 June. Again, some  people say you couldn™t 
have left in June because there was a genera
l quarantine. We ll, I know I left in June, you 
know, I mean -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I don™t care what the historian books say 
on that. People verif -- generalize from the 
generic fact, and apply it to everybody. 
 

Q: Right. So where did you all go?  And -- a
nd who -- was it Leo who ma de the decision 
 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after 
the war, there was a very st -- quick 
effort to identify, locate people who surv
ived. And whoever did this, mi ght -- the 

Russians, or others, ma de a list of the surv
ivors in tha -- in Theresienstadt, and people 
fr om different localities contacted the author
ities some where, that was designated, ma ybe 
Red Cross [indecipherable] I don™
t recall, obviously. And we 
had relatives who survived 
the war in Holland, who were in hiding during 
the war, in the broadest [indecipherable] 
were kind of some what distant, but in the 
context of the time they very close to my 
fa mily, partly they™re -- they were raised 
in the old country, very close in the same  
courtyard, effectively, so they were like ve
ry close cousins, brother, sister type 
relationship. Anyhow, that relative knew th
at, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch 
relatives they had, and went around finding out
 in Westerbork most
 probably, with the 
Dutch author ities, where are the S-Sigmann 
fa mily, my parents, my brothers and my 
sister and myself. And eventually they f
ound out that the only one
s who are surviving 
from their records was us three. And they got
 in touch with the Theresienstadt people, 
who went and got in touch with Malka 
We inma nn, and through us, and saying, oh, yo-
you will come  back, you have a place to go -- the people who were released from the se 

camps had a -- a place to go. We  had a place to go because some body was claimi ng us. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Had we not had that we would have been
 again, rerouted some where to a displaced 
persons camp, or hang around later in Theres
ienstadt, I don™t know what would have 
happened. But since we had a relative who wa
s putting a claim us and offered t-to come  
to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, w
ho also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, 
whose parents survived. So she was reunited 
with her parents, so her parents were 
claimi ng her. So we all went back on the 
train from Terezin to th
e American section, you 
know, Czechoslovakia ki nd of was split into di
fferent regions whoever liberated them. 

One half was the Russians, one half was th
e Americans or the Fr
ench, I think. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
57 
 
 
took a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and ma ybe
 took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I 
think a French plane, was probably a army tran
sport plane. And we stayed a few days or 
so with Malka We inma nn, because we were 
close to her. And you ask what attachme nt, 
that was probably -- I -- we sensed that. 
And well, a very different life suddenly, you 
know, plates, and tables, and food that we 
never had eaten before. White bread was 
served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. I had a tin can of anchovy 

paste, I don™t know whether you know what anc
hovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little 
thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips. Spent a few 

days over there, till they discussed with -- how
 to get us to these relatives, the Berger s, 
who themselves spent the war 
years separated from their ch
ildren, daughter and son. The 
daughter, son and parents were in three 
different locations, and they were -- 
 

Q: And they all survived? 

 

A: They survived, yes, they survived. And then
 I rejoined living with them after, for one 
year or so, till other fami ly me mbers else
where in the world started looking for the 

Sigmann family, and locating us
, and discovered we were the only survivors. So we spent 
a year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- 
from June to July, or June of ni -- June to 

June, from ™ 45 to ™46, and being -- lived in Amst erdam.  
 

Q: And how wa s that for you? 

 

A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they 
themselves had to reconstruct their lives, b
ecause they had a major interruption in thei r 
life. So we took in the scene of reconstituting 
life, but was really more norma l from what 
people were used to. I mean, s-sitting at a 
table with the fa mily rather  than in a 
compound. Cooking, baking, washing. You know, th-t
his family, the Bergers, they were 
hidden by some  nurses, single wome n who had 
worked in Indonesia 
before, and I think 

they lived at Amsterdam. And they live
d behind a partition wall for several years. 
Couldn™t go out in daytime. Didn™t know wher
e their daughter and son was -- were. Their 
daughter was too old to be hidden, but too 
young to be hidden, too, so she had had a 
quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked 
for some body in the outskirts of Amsterdam 
as a open house help, au pair. It™s -- her name
 is Miriam. And she was there, and -- very 
interesting st ory is that  we -- 
we -- once we came back, and told
 us their -- their tale, and 
each one has his own tale of escape and savi
ng. But this gi rl, Miriam, mu s-must have 

been around 16 ma ybe, by the end of the war, 
was in -- publicly hidden, and the people 
were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherabl
e] most people did not 
e -- travel -- or com 
-- can™t do anything on a Sunday. That when they
 later on came  to visit us, visit us on 
Saturday in fact, apologized that we came 
on the sebbe -- Sabbath. But they were very 
devout, they were very close to the family, 
but they were very good people, too. They -- 
in order to -- they kept the f
act that she was Jewish in hi
ding, or public hiding from the i r 
own children, so they couldn™t say very much, 
but they read the scriptures, and how the 
very devout Christians, and they 
tried to read the Scriptures 
associated with the holidays, 
to keep this girl informe d about purink and 
how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh 
-- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they 
read this -- the -- the portion she told us 
about, it was kind of -- and they™re very nice 
people. We met them after they came, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
58 
 
 
were very close. But kind of seeing how pe
ople were comi ng out of the war, and what 
they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. Their son, who was a 
tall fe llow, was in hiding in a little attic,
 in a little town up in 
-- in the country, agai n 
didn™t see daylight, public daylight for severa
l years. And he was an artist and he ma de 
wooden pins for the underground, emblems. I be
lieve that™s how he spent his time. And 
so the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part  of it, but we 

[indecipherable] we were visiting. These Berger
s are interesting peopl
e because they used 
to have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in 
Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently, 
before the wa r, and they had pretty elegant 
dishes, and cutlery, but
 after the war thei r 

apartment was gone, all their belongings were 
gone. They couldn™t -- they knew who they 
gave it, they couldn™t get it back, even becau
se they survived. People denied, apparently 
that they had received anything. They had to st
art from scratch, in very small quarters, we 
lived in very, very small quarters. There was 
no shower or bathtub in the house. We  ha d a 
little metal bathtub that we -- 
I was a little boy, I was able to 
use, other people used most 
probably too, and we went to public baths. 
This was the life. But for them it was a -- 
happy to survive, but was a big setback of thei
r lifestyle to what they had to live through, 
and reme mb er that. Of course they would -- ha
d the restaurant before, they™re still -- so 

they™re getting the old customers comi ng bac
k, come  and eat. Some  widowers, or single 
people, lost their family. So they used to 
come in the evening and se -- were served 
things. Whether they paid or not, I don™t know. But they kind of resume d the sort of role 

[indecipherable] that was their past life, 
and lot of war stories were comi ng around the 
table. You know, sort of hear
ing these things, the -- we were
 kind of a special case, now 
we had one experience, people had very diffe
rent experience. The hiding, some  survived, 
but only, you know, one person. And some  peop
le were trauma tized, and completely 
troubled. And I reme mbe r  one ma n, he used to 
come  to visit [indecipherable] Berger to 

talk or his despair -- despair. And I reme mber
 he was a very sad person, and he really -- 
when that man came in in the evening, we w
ould kind of shoot out of the room, the small 
quarter s. And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. So those kind of 

things, you k -- that was the ac -- different th
ings were going on in Amsterdam, it was -- 
it was not a norma l return to life, again. These pe
ople, the Bergers, at 
this restaurant , also 
kept kosher, obviously. And basically ate dair
y, because they didn™t ha ve  any dishes and 
cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very
 scarce anyhow, because that time the only 
meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. But because of their hospitality 

reputation, and restaurant repu
tation, the soldiers in the 
Jewish brigade, who passed 
through Holland from Canada, or from Engla
nd, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, 
stayed in their house, or ate in their hous
e. But they brought thei
r rations over to the 
Bergers, so the only time  we ate meat was to
 eat those rations the first time, after many 
years eating meat. But didn™t have enough cutlery
, or -- and no plates. So the cans were 
warmed up on the stove, and we passed around th
e can and this cutlery in order to eat. 
That™s the kind of -- for them it must have b
een a terribly painful contrast  after being a 

elegant rest aurant with all the trappi ngs of a 
restaurant, having to se
rve their own in this 
way. But they ma de -- they ma de the tran
sition, we™ll open up a
nother restaurant a 
number of years. 
 

Q: Theydid? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
59 
 
 
A: Oh yes, yes, in Scheveningen, of all places. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes, and then that -- then
 they move d to Israel, right. 

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: So, you know, I™m trying to convey that -- 

 

Q: Yeah,yeah. 

 

A: -- I was absorbing a complete new s -- and I wa
s getting older, I was able to record that 
mentally. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: And that became  part of my ex -- post-war experiences.  

 

Q: Did you, within a short period of time say, wher
e are our parents, or did you have a se -- 
 

A: No, I was told -- 

 

Q: Yo-You were told. 

 

A: -- I wa -- I was -- I was told that
 we lost our parents, they died. 
 

Q: You were told that . 

 

A: Whatever that meant -- 

 

Q: Uh huh. Meant, yeah. 

 

A: -- in the long run, that was not a issue. 

 

Q: Okay. And were you told that once you had 
left Theresienstadt, or do you -- do you have 
any recollection? 
 

A: No, I think already most probably before, 
because when we got that postcard from the 
train, in discussions with my 
brother and sister, whenever 
it may have come up, I think I 
had it already a general sense -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- that I have no longer my parents.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
60 
 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: But after the war, when you hear other st
ories of -- people™s life
 stories of losing a 
husband, a wife, children, then I real
ized that -- where I fit it i
n, that I also lost parents. I 
was part of the group of people who went th
rough the war, some  
went through in hiding, 
be -- people in groups, some  we
re in hiding. Some  were in th
is camp, some were in that 
camp, some  were in convents. And I was in tw
o camps, and some  people lost -- or didn™t 
lose, and I lost. So eventually
 I fit it in to my category, a
nd -- but that was a pretty 
dynami c -- I use the word dynami c selectively, 
seeing people were re
ally -- had to re-
establish themself, that some  people could ma
ke it. And also it was very much evident 
people want get out of Europe as -- or Holla
nd as fast as possible, ma ny people, they -- 
the first opportunity to get out, and 
especially the children. They sh -- 
 

Q: Especiallychildren? 

 

A: There -- they -- once they get their [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Children. 

 

A: -- out of the country, out of Europe. Not 
a good place to be. Partly out of me mory, but 
partly out of experience. So it was a si zeable
 exodus. Felt wa -- was -- weren™t too ma ny 
people who survived, okay? But there was a 
noticeable exodus of people who left to 
England, people who left to isr -- Palestine.
 And some  people stayed. And some  elderly 
parents -- pa -- no --  reluctantly but willingl
y encouraged their children to leave. And 
some  people couldn™t stop the children that want
 to get out of there 
as fast  as possibl e. 
And that a -- again, I absorbed that pa rt of the scene. 
 

Q: Right. We  need to change the tape.

Tape #6 
 
Q: Charles, did you want to leave? 

 

A: I did leave, as you know. 

 

Q: I know. I know you did, I wanted to -- 

 

A: Right, but for different re
asons than what was occurring. 
Th -- when I say people who 
were eager to leave were the older people 
[indecipherable] not sure, take these two 
children of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam 
and M a nfred, they got out as fast, but they 
wanted to leave right away, I mean they were
 -- imagine not being w
ith their parents for 
several years, and May, June they see them, 
and they wanted to get out, on -- go to 
Palestine. The parents did not -- were not en
couraging that right away, but reluctantly 

they yielded, so right after the high holidays, 
they left  on the illegal transport, where they 
were put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long j
ourney. But -- so that age bracket and above, 
there was a much greater personal decisi on to
 leave Europe, or leave Netherlands. They 
both went to Palestine. One of them t here 
right now. The tragedy was that the brother 
ended up in Palestine. When the st ate was es
tablished, he was in the army, and he was 
killed by a convoy in the protection of Jeru
salem during the War of Independence. Was 
just -- had just become  engaged to a beautif
ul Yeme nite girl, and 
so now that™s -- the 
fa mily had to absorb that loss after being sp
ared the other hurdles 
of the war, ended up a 
victim in Palestine - Israel. Parents notfully reverc -- recovered from that wound, 

whereas the war wounds were h
ealing, that wound kind of was 
pretty difficult for them to 
deal with. But other people also were leavi
ng. And in contrast to the pre-war, which I 
don™t recall too much, We
sterbork or Terezin, there I di
d have friends. I visited homes 
like in more normal circumstances. But ag
ain, it was some what temporary, because 
people I dealt with, they moved out to othe
r countries suddenly, okay?  And myself also 

left. But it wa s a different -- but I do know th
e name s of people who were there. We  
joined the youth organization, I 
think it was the precursor of 
Bnei Akiva. My brother was 
older, he was allowed to join, I tagged along 
with him, and given that was much choice, 
not too ma ny other children around, they let 
me  come . And we went to hikes and 
activities. So we had a little more norma l t
ype of event, of youth organizations that 
obviously you didn™t have before, and some  of 
the names of the people from that period I 
still know by name . And I™ve discovered r
ecently one is in t -- ma rried, you know, with 

fa milies in Toronto, and one lives in Israel
, and one here, one no longer lives. But that 
kind of life became mor e  norma lized. I went to school in Amsterda m, Jewish school, and 

es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in e
ither synagogue, with people. So it kind of -- 
but even those teachers st arted leaving. We  
had the teacher, and the mi ddle of the year 
they went to England. Of course, it was not
 a -- people weren™t on the firm ground, or so. 
So we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural 
for me  to leave, because that™s what other 

people were doing for all kinds of reasons, whic
h I ma y not have been fully aware. But it 
was not my decision, of sorts, because my ot
her relatives, who were closer in relative 
ranking that the Bergers, my fa
ther™s brother lived the United 
States, and they were also 
related to the Bergers so they were in touc
h, wanted us to join 
him. And my mother™s 
sister  in Zurich wanted us to join them. So
 we were wanted, but we were kind of being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
62 
 
 
pulled in two different directions. And the 
decision was that the two boys would go to 
New York, and the girl would go to Zurich. Wh
e t her that™s wi -- wise decision or not is 
not for me  t o say. 
 
Q: Who -- who ma de that decision, do you think? 

 

A: Therelatives. 

 

Q: Ah, I see. 

 

A: I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerne
ss to want to absorb us, and you know, take 
care of us as children without parents. And they
 decided, not to divide the spoils, but they 
thought that boys would be better off in e
ducation, particularly 
Jewish education in 
United States, and the girl would fit in bette
r in Switzerland. My aunt had a -- uncle had a 
dress st ore, an elegant dr ess st ore, and sh
e could perhaps work her way into that. But 
anyway, we were split, which my si ster 
to this day finds horrendous. And she found it 
very surprising that it was 
proposed and imple me nted. 
 

Q: Wasn™t it di ffi cult for the three of you to split like that? 

 

A: It was difficult, yes, yes. And especially t
hose we re days where na 
-- ba -- people didn™t 
have telephone conversations, you 
know, you wrote to each other,
 kept in touch that way.  
 

Q: But she of course, rema ins even mor e  alone. 
You are split, but you™re 
still with the one -- 
 

A: I have a brother. 
 
Q: You have a brother. 

 

A: Exactly,exactly. 

 

Q: And he -- she goes into --
 did she know these folks? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Not -- no -- 

 

A: No --  

 

Q: -- these ar e st rangers. 

 

A: -- well, well, my -- my uncle 
from Switzerland, that™s the -- 
my aunt -- my si -- mother™s 
sister™s husband came to vis
it us in ™46, okay?  Very nice,
 brought clothing and candy and 
treated us, and -- very nice, and 
told us about the fa mily linkage
s, and all of that, and so it 
was either  total st ranger --  we knew th
e name  of t he fa mil
y, the -- these -- okay. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
63 
 
 
Q: [indecipherable] but this wa
s not someone close that you -- 
 
A: We hadn™t dealt with them in years, obvious
ly. And the United States family, all I knew 
was my father™s brother, my uncle. But I ha
d never seen him. I don™t think my brother 
saw him either. And they were again, far awa
y, the United States was far, far away. So 
that was a new change in our life status of
 being separated, moved away from Holland, 
and a new stage of our life had to begin. Bu
t agai n, the intentions certainly were well-

intentioned. Whether is was a
ppropriate under the circumstan
ces, but that set the course 
for our lives, and with the ca -- impl -- c
onsequence. My sister ma rried some body fr om 
Switzerland, we ended up in United States. A
nd were raised over there by my uncle and 
aunt, who were very generous to absorb tw
o mor e  children in a household of six children. 
 

Q: They had six? 

 

A: They had six. 

 

Q: Wow. 

 

A: And raised us effectively under their au
spices, so I™m certainly appreciative -- 
 

Q: And this was in New York City? 

 

A: In New York City. 

 

Q: Did he remi nd you of your 
father at all?  Wa s there any -- anything that struck you? 
 
A: Mm, I -- wa -- that  -- my me mory of my fa
ther was vague. I -- my -- the only me mory of 
my father is this --  the last scene, sitting 
on his lap with tefillin on his head. That™s not a 
association, that™s a picture, a photograph.No, I don™t -- I was too young to ma ke that 

sort of linkage.  
 

Q: Did you get along with
 the other six kids? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Yes?  

 

A: Yeah,sure. 

 

Q: They didn™t -- they didn™t mi nd two more. 

 

A: Not -- no, they were kind. I mean [indeciphe
rable] me , I was another refugee, and the 
immi grant, and -- 
 

Q: Green. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
64 
 
 
A: -- kid who went through the war. Went th
rough the war. So, of a helpful, and -- 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- no, and some  of the children were closer in 
my  age, so I could relate to them, and some  
were close to my brother. They fi  -- we fitted in after awhile, and at the time we were 

arrive already, the olde
r children kind of were started to
 move out of the house. So, the 
fa mily was not as large on a daily basis. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: It still was large, I mean, and totally a
ppreciative obviously that I had a ho me . Because 
otherwise, you know, that™s a big problem af
ter the war, people were home less. Some 
people had, you know, lost their parents, a
nd their siblings, or
 what have you, and 
nowhere to go. And their imme diate, or s -- di
stant relatives were also killed during the 
war, so I was relatively better off. 
 

Q: Right. Did y -- when did you l
earn English, when you came he re? 
 
A: Yes, yes.  

 

Q: So you -- what -- did you speak a common language in the household before you learned 
English? 
 

A: Well, they spoke Germa n, I understood Ge
rman. I don™t know where exactly I learned 
German, but  I learned Ge rman some where along 
the line. Of course, at home  we did not 
speak German, Dutch was -- probably -- the parents spoke Yiddish. But that was a 

common language, and then I start -- 
 

Q: What did you think of New York?  It™s so di
r -- I mean, Amsterdam is
 small, very quaint. 
New York is huge, ma ssive. 
 

A: Oh, it was very massive, oh yes, it was very
 ma ssive. And the whole -- well, generally, 
after the war, a lot of things were brand 
new for me . I mean, the food was brand new. I 
had eaten -- I had not eaten ora
nges till I -- I think got in the 
-- either in Amsterda m or 
got in the plane and -- 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: -- of -- or so. When I came off the boat,
 came here on the boat, people offered me  a 
banana, I didn™t know how to open it. I mean, it™s a strange food.  
 

Q: Course. 

 

A: Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland af
ter the war, there were all kinds of new ec -- 
experiences or so, about food, or otherwise.
 I reme mber with my bo -- my uncle from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
65 
 
 
Switzerland, who took us out and treated us
 to vanilla ice cream
. And the pungency of 
that vani lla taste is still in 
my mouth, I mean, I just -- it™s
 very different today, doesn™t 
have the same  intensity of taste, but it was a 
very strong taste, a flavor which I never had, 
or don™t recall, I ma y have had it when I was fi
ve or six. But from five to six to nine was 
a long time . So those things kind of, you know, 
were all sensations 
that we experienced. 
There was an ho -- another interesting thing 
was I was saying of -- people were kind of 
comi ng out of the woodwork in some sense. 
The people who were in hiding got out right 
away, from the camps. Those who had a place to
 go had right away -- some straggled in, 
depends where they were kept, in which 
camp. So it was an ongoing process of people 
comi ng, and eventually people leaving. Wa s a 
lot of young people, particularly children 
had to be taken out of convents or hi ding 
places, and was a big battle some ti me s, you 
know, older sisters f -- survived. [indecipherabl
e] little sister was in the convent in 
Belgium, we nt through the effort, identified 
everything [indecipherabl
e] and that little 
girl refused to come . Again, in this Berger 
household we had a lot of traffic, but people -- 
there was a home, people came across. So I in 
some  sense absorbed more of that than I 

would have otherwise. And I reme mb er those tw
o sisters finally succe
ssful in getting out, 
this whole discussion of getting 
thei r little sist er out, fi nally
 getting their sister out, and 
the sister rebellious, she wants to go back to th
e si ster s in Belgium, rather than the sisters 
in Holland. And I think eventually she had -- ha
d -- had to yield it, 
they got -- bring her 
back. You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Ra
bbi Herzog went through country to country, 
also through Holland, trying to save those ch
ildren, invoking his posi
tion in dealing with 
the clergy, and the church. And had very grea
t difficult time, I reme mber him there with 
his top hat, and ma king, you know, talking about 
his experiences. That was an event. So, 
it was -- th-the post-war recons
titution was very much an act
ivity of the country, of the 
Jewish community. And therefore wa s a lot of activity and moveme nt, and was not a -- 

you know, a stable community, were never 
-- never really became stable, because 
Holland as you know, lost a very highproportion of it™s Jewish population. 

Underestimated the people talk about [indeci
pherable]. The interesti
ng little side story, 
my relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he wa
s a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who 
was a -- a shoe store. And one day he sent a cr
ate of Yaffa oranges to him. And that was a 
communion celebration, they handed out thes
e oranges as prizes to people, and 
everybody took those -- an orange for their en
tire fa mily. And there was the biggest gift 
they could ever dream of after going th
rough the war, of getting some thing from 
Palestine, a Yaffa orange. So, I reme mber
 we got one too, and it was something, you 
know, unique. So a lot of feelings were going 
on in the country, which today people have 
much less -- they take a lot of things for 
granted. Every -- every -- ev -- al l these events 
became events rather than, you know, part of a 
routine life. So it was, in some sense, 
quote, exciting. Because things we
re really appearing, and I wa s -- as I was getting olde r, 
I was a -- absorbing these things much mo
re than anything before [indecipherable] 
certainly I was a little boy, 
but already approaching 10 - 11, 
to move on there. So carry 
back interesting me mories of the year in Holland. 
 

Q: W- Was there any schooli
ng during that year, or  
 

A: Yes [indecipherable]  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477

Q: Therewas?  
 

A: There was schooling, in a Jewish school, 
and I got -- there got my for mal teaching, 
arithmetic, and geography, and -- 
 

Q: So you were finally getting some  subjects that you hadn™t at all? 

 

A: Yes, absolutely, and sp -- Dutch gramma
r, and m- more formal instruction, and also 
Jewish suppleme ntary education as well. 
 

Q: Did you enjoy it? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Youdid? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. I mean had [indecipherable]
 fortunately I had no 
learning disability or 
learning problem, and most pr
obably I wasn™t the only one 
who had the shortcoming of 
lack of education, cause pe -- similar people 
that were my age  must have had some thing 
similar, didn™t go to school during the wa
r. So it ma y have be en, you know, equal peer 
class. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Like, I never thought of it in
 these terms, but my -- I -- 
I went to do what s-s-sc -- 
students ha ve  to do. And so anyway, we went 
to the United States, a long route, because 
The Joint wa s involved in transporting people 
from one country to another, and so it wa s 
a torturous trip to go from Holland to Antwer
p, to end up in Marseilles on the buses and 
trains, or so, and in fact I saved The Joint, I think, a big bundle because one of the stops, 

one of the night st -- overnight stops was a 
U.S. army ca mp, a nd we™re supposed to stay 

one night then go on to the next stop and go 
to whatever quarters we were supposed to 
go. They have a whole gr oup, not only us, I mean a bunch of children. And I became 

violently sick in that -- 
 

Q: Firsttime. 

 

A: First time. The odors of the mess hall were so 
powerful that I actua
lly couldn™t take it. I 
became sick, and vomiting, and fever and all of that. I ma y have had other problems, too. 

So the com- commander of the camp was very 
upset that some body became  sick under his 
reign. So he told people to stay till I 
become  healthy. But they
 kne -- they knew our 
travelogue, or itinerary, and he ke
pt us there till we able to 
go to the boat to Marseilles. 
So I think The Joint saved a big bundle, for again, strange reasons. And they took a -- 

took a boat to the United St
ates, a long journey. 
 

Q: A cargo boat, or an actual -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
67 
 
 
A: No, it was a boat that was used for the U.S.
 army originally, for -- so it was not a -- a 
cruise boat, but it had bert
hs for people to sleep. 
 
Q: Sleep. 

 

A: So, it was a long trip, with a stor m in the oceans -- 

 

Q: Get sea sick? 

 

A: Yes.Seriously. 

 

Q: It™sterrible. 

 

A: It was a terrible day, it was a terrible day. 
It was a Saturday in fact it was, and we™re up 
on the deck and vomiting, etcetera. And well, 
that™s what the [ind
ecipherable] kind of, 
then a new st age of life, which -- come  to 
the United States, and be absorbed in a new 
fa mily. And schooling over there, and then things became uphill. 
 

Q: You -- you adjust rather quickly, though, don™
t you, usually, to circumstances, some how -
- 
 

A: Apparently I do.  

 

Q: -- it seems. 

 

A: Apparently I do, yes. 
 
Q: E-Easier than Le
o, your older brother? 

 

A: I would say most probably. Yes, I think he 
took things more for -- he must -- may have 
been more aware than I was what™s happe
ning around him, s o he took a little more 
difficult. I do make the -- I did make the adju
stme nts reasonably well. 
In fact, I talked to 
a survivor , and really there are two stages of 
survival, one is survive the war, another one 
is survive the post-war. 
 

Q: Post-war,right. 

 

A: And I did, thank God, both. 

 

Q: And what was -- what wa s the name  of the fa mily, I know the last name  was Siegma n, 
but -- 
 

A: Siegman. 

 

Q: -- they spelled it di fferently than you. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
68 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] right, our original name
 was Sigmann, S-i-g-m- m -- m- a-n-n. That was 
the family name . When my uncle, Mendel Si
egma n came to United Stat es, they changed 
it to S-i-e-g-m- a-n, because double n is always
 -- was regarded as a European legacy, I 
don™t know how he knew that, or whoever it was -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- but that™s how it was. So when we  came 
to United States, rather than having in the 
fa mily, same household, Sigmann and si
g -- Si egma n, we took on their name , but 
eventually it had to be changed when I became a citizen, formally, because my -- my 

passport, original passport from Holland to 
United States was S-i-g-m- a-n-n. That™s how 
I was registered.  
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: But the difference in the spelling is
 not that great, so we took it on. 
 

Q: Why did they change the name  to S-i-e?
 Why not S-i-g-m- a-n, do you have any idea? 
 

A: No, I think it sounds -- zi -- see,
 in the German pronunciation was Ziegma n. 
 

Q: Ziegman, I see. 

 

A: Okay. And zieg is i -- is a -- 

 

Q: Right. 
 
A: Okay. So they only changed the double n, but
 I wasn™t -- again, I was not there when it 
happened. 
 

Q: Did you call him uncle all the time? 

 

A: Uncle, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: And his wife, aunt? 

 

A: His wife Aunt Susie, yes, 
yes, yes. We knew that we, know, 
were not part of the original 
fa mily, we were old enough that -- I mean, 
that -- had it been, you know, five years 

earlier, ma y have been different story, you know
? So we kept our fa mily identity, but we 
were certainly part of the -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Siegma n fa mily, and raised under their guidance and support, and -- 

 

Q: And -- and how ma ny ye ars before you saw Lily again? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
69 
 
 
 
A: I saw Lily again in 1960. 

 

Q: Wow.  

 

A: A long time. 

 

Q: Longtime. 

 

A: She had mo ved to Israel, 1951, I think, ma rried, had a -- 

 

Q: Oh, so she -- she left fairly soon from that family? 

 

A: She left fairly soon, yes, yes. She went down Aliyah. 

 

Q: So she must have been six -- 16 or 17 when she left. 

 

A: Around that time, 16 - 17, right, yes, yes. 

 

Q: Wow. So she must have been unhappy in some  way, no?  I mean -- 

 

A: I don™t want to speak for her. 

 

Q: You don™t know. 

 

A: I mean, I don™t want to put an [indecipherable] on her. 
 
Q: Yes,yeah. 

 

A: But she wanted to go to -- 

 

Q: ToIsrael . 

 

A: Israel . 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And then she had me t some body, but  she wasn™t
 ma rried when she left -- who was also 
going to Israel. And soon after, they ma rried
 in Israel, and settled there. But 1960 -- 
meanwhile we were in t
ouch through letter writing. 
 

Q: Yes, I understand. 

 

A: So-- 

 

Q: But he -- here you -- you all grow up -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
70 
 
 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- and you™re adults now. 

 

A: Absolutely. No, it was a big change. 

 

Q: Big change, you know. 

 

A: Big change, but interesting, ther
e was a lot of personal chemistry. 
 

Q: Yes? 

 

A: Oh yes, we retained, oh yes, because of 
our letter writing, and some how it went through 
together. When I visited her 1960, was imme diatel
y back to where we left off, whatever 
that word means. 
 

Q: Right. That™s fabulous. 

 

A: And this -- and the same  thing was true w
ith this daughter Berger
. I hadn™t seen her -- 
well, that™s [i ndecipherable] right. I hadn™t se
en her from 1946, when she left after the -- 
1945. 
 

Q: Until --  until -- 

 

A: Well, then I saw her in happene when I vi
sited Holland on 1960, then to Israel, too, I me t 
her again.  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: But we started off where  we left off.  

 

Q: The same  thing, yeah. 

 

A: Yes. And now too, when we meet or so -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- we have a much more sense of belongi
ng to the same  fa mi l y or so, than -- or -- 
although we have very different paths, different experiences since then, but we still have 

a lot in common. 
 

Q: Did you feel you divided culturally when
 you were here?  Or were you young enough so 
that you soon became a kind of Ame r ican ki d?  Do you have that -- do you have any -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
71 
 
 
A: Well, now it took getting used to, I mean, but
 people acclimate when 
they -- first of all, 
want to acclimate quickly. I came in with th
e Berger family, was -- they didn™t want to 
send us with old, ragged clothe
s so they went out -- out of the way to buy new wool suit 
for us, with the knickers, pants or so. That™s
 how I arrived United States, but it was not 
stylish here, and I disposed 
of them very quickly, okay? 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And I started wearing, you 
know, American type clothing, a
nd so I -- I -- the language 
took a little longer. I was in some  sense fo
rtunate again under the 
circumstances that I 
was raised in a neighborhood in the West Side, 
where there were a lot of immi grants, too. 
Urban fa milies who so --  survived the war, or came  pre-war, so it was not comi ng into 

mi ddle America. Was partly European, and West Side in general is very cosmopolitan.  
 

Q: Now where in the We st Side were you?  Lower West? 

 

A: No, the upper -- upper West Side. 

 

Q: A hundred -- 

 

A: 88
th
 Street. 
 

Q: Oh,88
th
, okay. 
 

A: West -- on the We st End Avenue. 

 
Q: Right. 
 

A: So -- and the synagogue we went to was again, 
familiar territory, and so it was at -- that 
cultural change was not as dr
amatic had it been otherwise, what some  people went 
through. But the language and the clothing 
you saw this, you want to be, you know, like 
everybody else. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So I had to learn quickly. And up to a poi
nt, the children in school were kind to me , 
because again, there -- that was [indecipherabl
e]. I was a refugee, went through the wa r, 
whatever that meant, no parents. That™s -- some
 were sensitive, some  we re not, but on the 

whole, they had experienced that too, because 
the school that I went 
to, they had -- I was 
the first one who was -- they had [indecipherabl
e] seen this before, so it was interesting. 

A kind of interesting story was that when -- it 
wa s I learned how to play one of the sports, 
and, you know, and be one of the boys or so, so
 in the courtyard during recess, the kids 

played punchball. You k
now what a punchball is? 
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
72 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] a pink 
Spaulding -- Spaulding -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- punching [indecipherable] baseball with 
base -- with a Spaulding. And everybody had 
to be chosen for the team, that was the rule, 
so I was chosen as well on one of the teams, 
but I was useless because I didn™t know what
 the game  was all about, didn™t understand 
the language or the instructions, what peopl
e screaming about. And my luck was that a 
guy, the other team hits the -- punches the 
ball right to me , and I mi ss it, and people 
started jeering and screaming. And then 
one young kid, young little fellow with black 

eyes, reme mber his name , got up and scolded 
the kids. This boy went through the war, 
etcetera, lost his parents, et
cetera. If you [indecipherable] w
ith him, you™ll never get it -- 
never hear it again, the end of it. And then 
suddenly I was part of the team, and people 
accepted me . So it was a good lesson, people learned I was so -- I mean, the kind of 

[indecipherable] fact I re
cite it indicat es that I reme mber it favorably. 
 

Q: Absolutely. 

 

A: But it was a need to be, you know, integrat
ed in the small and the big. But again, my 
transi tion was a little bit better than it cou -- 
it could have been much worse. Wa sn™t -- for 
me it was a gradual transition to the Ameri
can scene, because the rest  of the people 
around me were also heavily from immigrant families. 
 

Q: Right. We  have to stop 
the tape and change it.

Q: Charles, what did your uncle do? 

 

A: He was in the diamond business. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Wholesaler. But originally when he came 
to the United Stat es, he was in textiles in 
Europe, and he had to start a new business, 
of course, ca -- can™t 
do textiles over here. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A:  Wasdi ffi cul t .  

 

Q: And where did he come  from, did he -- from Poland?  Przemysl? 

 

A: He came from -- was born in Przemysl as we
ll, and lived in Frankfurt, and lived in 
Antwerp. And he ma naged to escape with his fa
mily, quite an ordeal, and quite a story, if 
you want to hear a -- what™s called a fli
ght story, I recommend 
you speak to his son. A 
rema rkable story, how they ma nage d to go 
through enemy t e rritory, 
through France, back 
to Belgium, through Casablanca, to the United 
States, with being separated, and my a unt 
being pregnant, and having a -- he had -- my unc
le had his -- my grandmother, his mother 
with him. 
 

Q: Wow.  
 
A: And down the line, I me an, quite a story how 
they ma  -- how they ma de it, how they were 
not driving cars, and [indecipherable] had to hi
re a car for at that time , for  five children 
and two adults in Europe, a truck or so, and use your wits about it. 
Is -- if you -- I don™t 
know if you have any flight docume ntary -- 
documentation, but it™s 
a rema rkable story. 
 

Q: So you -- what grade to you start when you 
start school there, si
nce you seem to --  
 

A: Well, since I had a year in Holland -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- I was not as much back, so f -- had -- tec
hnically I had -- give me  credit for one year 
for Holland, and the second year over there. So
 when I came  to the United States, they 
put me  into fourth grade. 
 

Q: Okay. So you™re actually pretty much where you should be. 

 

A: No, no, I was -- no -- no, no. I came to United States in ™46, when I was -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
74 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. 
 

A: -- okay?  I should have been 
really in the fifth grade. 
 

Q: Yeah,right. 

 

A: So I™m -- I spent, I think a few months in th
e fourth grade, and I was promoted to the fifth 
grade. Where I was mor e  sensitive, I wanted
 to be where I belonged, somehow. That -- 
and I fortunately caught up soon e
nough that I did not have to -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- you know, carry that, being behind, whatev
er that meant, for a long period. But the 
year in Holland was pretty good for me . I think it was in Holland, it was in Holland, it 

was in the third grade they put me . So, oddl
y enough, my arithme tic 
was better than peop 
-- 
 

Q: I™m not surprised. 

 

A: -- than the kids over here -- 

 

Q: The kids here, right.  

 

A: -- were, and so I was -- I -- I did all right 
in schooling, and yet ma na
ged to catch up quick 
enough.  
 
Q: Right. And you went to high school
 on the upper We st Side as well? 
 
A: No, no, no. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: No, no, no. I went after one year in upper West Side for a kind of day school, I went to 
Yeshiva in the East Side. 
 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: By the sixth grade. And went 
through high school there as well. 

 

Q: And then where did you go to s -- college? 

 

A: Then I went to City College in the evening. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. And you worked during the day? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
75 
 
 
A: Part time , and studied in the morning, a
nd the evening -- I worked in the afternoon, I 
went to evening college.  
 
Q: And what were you doing as work? 

 

A: I was -- afternoon I was teaching in Hebrew
 school, and one seme ster I worked in the 
me dical library. I went into evening school
, and got my degree, and then went for 
graduate studies, Columbia. 
 

Q: Ineconomics? 

 

A: Economics. 

 

Q: And h -- how did that interest grow? We
re you always interested in economi cs, do you 
think?  
 

A: No, I mean, no it actually was through e
xposure primarily, the c
hoices that -- some  
subject matters I was more interested in comp
ared with others, and I was challenged by th 
-- the bottom line is I had the most difficulty 
with economics, that™s why I went for it. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Right. The other courses went much e asier. I thought originally of going into 
international relations, or so and was -- ha
d easy street, I got A™s, and you know, just 
coasting through it, and economics I had to 
think, had to read
. So, I decided --  
 
Q: So you wanted the challenge -- 
 

A: I wa -- I wanted to
 understand it, so -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I went through a -- I went through economi
cs, on to graduate and -- as a ma jor in 
graduate studies as well, and -- 
 

Q: And you got a PhD? 

 

A: Co -- all but dissertation. And worked towa
rd the university for -- 
or college for nine 
years, and -- 
 

Q: AtSwarthmore? 

 

A: Swa -- first at City College for nine y
ears, and then Swarthmo re for five years. 
 

Q: Mm-hm. And when did you get ma rried? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
76 
 
 
A: 1962, in Montreal. 
 

Q: So when you went to is -- no, this is afte
r you went to Israel for the first time and saw 
your sister. 
 

A: After,right. 

 

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

 

A: Right, right. By chance, my
 wife was in Israel the same  summer when I was there. 
 

Q: Nokidding? 

 

A: And we did meet, but I didn™t know w
ho she was at that time , so two years 
[indecipherable] 
 

Q: So where did you meet her? 

 

A: On the street with a group, she was with a group of youngsters, and I knew some  people 
in that group. So I had a conversation, which she recalls, too. 
 

Q: That™s funny. And you me t in Canada? 

 

A: In New York, she was in New York . 

 

Q: In New York, I see. 
 
A: And the rest is all good history. Mu
ch, much more favorablechapter. 
 

Q: She had a good -- she had a be
tter history than you did? 
 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. She was -- 

 

Q: Cause she was here, she was here? 

 

A: She lived in Montreal. She 
was raised in Montreal -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh. I see. 

 

A: -- and her parents had been there for -- wa
y before the war, so she did not personally 
experience, nor did her parents -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- directly. Her parent s lost --  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
77 
 
 
Q: Excuse me . The plane, I™m so -- yes, oka
y. It™s the first time we™ve had a plane, okay. 
Yes, she come s from M ontreal, ye
s?  She was raised in Montreal? 
 
A: Mont -- raised Montreal, a
nd did not have direct experien
ce with the Holocaust, although 
her parents, her mother di d lose some  sisters.  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: In Poland, who left -- who rema ined th
ere. So she had a more norma l upbringing. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: And that -- also the good
 chapters in my life. 
 

Q: Yes. With four children. 

 

A: Four children, and -- 

 

Q: A boy and three girls. 

 

A: -- I have nice grandchild
ren, and a lot of, you know, happy days and times and -- and of 
rewards for surviving.  
 

Q: Yes. D-Do you, when you look back on the time s  after the war, do you see a lot of ways 
in which what happened to you affected you, or is
 that really very difficult to parse out? 
 
A: Well, it™s -- definitely the war experien
ce is engraved into me . I mean, I know, I went 
through the war, I know I lost my parents and 
two brothers. So I™m very sensitized to the 
Shoah and what happened, part because I live
d through it, in my own wa y. I was not as 
directly affected like some  other people 
went through hell. I di
d not have, you know, my 
-- any numbers carved into me . And I  was not 
beaten up physically, or
 so, but I certainly 
am a victim of not -- of having had a lost 
childhood. I me an that 
never -- right? I knew I 
was different, but [indecipherable] and the 
younger ages when I came United States, I 
knew I was not the same  everybody else. Othe
r people had parents, other people had 
norma l me mories, I had no pictures of my 
childhood, I had very few concrete episodes, 
no fa mily vacations, except for I went back, you know, to the beach story, but -- so I -- I 
know I was different, and I was at a young age is
 especially more sensitive. Once you get 
ma rried and have children, you join another ca
tegory of life. I was more with a similar 
group, but the issue where you come  from, whet he
r it was raised, or -- know, specifically, 
or underlying, people talk about experienceswhich I could never talk about. Or show 

pictures, or some thing of this 
sort, so that respect it affected
 me, or so, over time I th -- 
I™m sure that my sensitivities about the world events or so, must have some roots in my 

experience as well. I don™t want to link everyt
hing who I am, I do -- I 
don™t want to sou -- 
I never wanted to, I don™t intend to psychoana
lyze myself, of you know
, my behavior or 
good deeds, or bad deeds, or good habits or ba
d habits are attributed
 to the war, and I 
don™t feel that I have to glean 
who I am, or attribute who I am
 to the war experience. I am 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
78 
 
 
who I am with that being part 
of me , but it™s -- certainly it
™s a very central part of my 
me mory of - -  or so, though fortunately, si
nce 1945, ma ny other even
ts have happened, I 
mean good e vents have ha ppened, that they have  receded, okay, proportionately of my  
life, I have the good life. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Okay? But that doesn™t eliminate -- 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: -- what I went through, and aw
areness of it. I™m a different 
person, of course, of what I 
went through. How different, in which ways, 
very difficult to pinpoint. Obviously, I me an 
[indecipherable] I™d never come  to the Unite
d States, I mean, that™s [indecipherable] you 
know, and my wife -- if you go through -- if 
you go this sort of route, so -- 
 

Q: You wouldn™t have me t, you wouldn™t have -- 

 

A: Would -- exactly, we wouldn™t 
be sitting over here right now. 
So I -- by the nature of the 
animal, life would be different because of the war in so ma ny ways which I cannot eve -- 

trace. Nor would I know what had happened. Y
ou can™t predict -- too 
parallel life events, 
or so. So I am who I a m, with that being a ma jor part of me . 
 

Q: Did your uncle talk to you a lot about your 
father and your mother, so you could get a -- a 
-- a pictur e of them? 
 
A: No, he talked very little 
about his family in general.  
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And talked very, very little about my father
 and mother. My aunt from Switzerland talked 
more, oddly enough. 
 

Q: You mean the one that -- who took in -- 

 

A: -- the one -- the one that
™s -- my sister, Lily, right. 
 

Q: Lily, I see. 

 

A: Not oddly, I think, just different circumst
ances. And my uncle was much more tight 
lipped about fa mily in general, or -- not to [i
ndecipherable] re us. In 
part I also think that 
he -- that™s more speculation th
an fact, but I feel that ma ybe
 even fact, he I think felt 
some what guilty that he  did not do more to ge
t my parents out, whether it would be more 
encouraging or physical action. He
 himself had come  to the Unite
d States in ™41 or so, so 
there were some  years involved. I have no idea 
-- I have no clue how muc h contact they 
had. He told us [indecipherable] was very -- 
always a very -- my -- my father was the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
79 
 
 
older brother, and he always told about hi
s respect and, you know, esteem for hi m, only 
to talk to him as a younger brother. But he 
never talked about de
tails of background. But 
he never talked about his own -- to his own ch
ildren either, too much. 
So when I speak to 
my cousins, his children are so now about -- 
because they also regret they never pumped 
him for information just in the family tree.
 [indecipherable] or so, and his background or 
so. Anyways, the answer to your question is no, 
very little infor mation about my parents. 
So that™s another void. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: How they lived, how they celebrated, how th
ey did things. My br
other knows a little bit 
more, my si ster knows bits and pieces, I know
 very little. That™s certainly a blank 
compared to other children.  
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: Wa -- so again, that -- it™s understandably I 
was a very little boy, 
right, so I don™t recall 
where -- and my sister me ntions to me that for my father™s 40
th
 birthday he got a electric 
shaver. 
 

Q: And you wouldn™t know, right. 

 

A: I wouldn™t know, right?  That was a big deal 
in Holland to get an electric shaver, because 
people used to use shaving paste -- 
 

Q: Right. 
 
A: -- to do the beards, so. 

 

Q: Let me  ask you an odd -- some thing of an odd question. When you me ntioned the 
postcard, and your brother te
lling you of the postcard, some thing happened to you.  
 

A: I choked up a little more, right? 

 

Q: Yeah. What is it, i-is that symbol  of the loss for you, do you think, or s -- 

 

A: In part it™s a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content. I mean, for parents to 
write a farewell note to parent -- to the childre
n is not norma l, and for a brother to end up 
saying [i ndecipherable] which means I will s
ee you again, and never materialized, is a 
painful me ssage to receive , but never follow 
through. So more emotions may be evoked 
from that than describing th
at they went on a train, and th
ey open up a -- a suitcase in the 
camp.  
 

Q: Right, right. Okay. Is there 
anything else you™d like to me nti
on that I have not asked?  I™m 
sur e  t h er e™ s - - 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
80 
 
 
A: I™m sure there™s things that you would like me
 to ask which I haven™t answered, or I -- no, 
I wa -- my job was not to know, give you a
ll my thoughts and feelings. I me an, you a sked 
a number of intriguing questions or so, I thi
nk gives you a -- some  sense of what the war -
- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- was -- me ant for me , what I -- what little 
part I played as one i
ndividual, and -- well, in 
some sense our fa milies are like mi c-mi crocosm of one type of -- 
 

Q: Absolutely. 

 

A: -- Holocaust story, you know. And the implications of it all are se
rious, you know, let™s 
talk about millions of peopl
e. Here™s a very, you know, quote, norma l fa mily that was 
split apart. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: To the extent that I have four children a
nd a fami ly and grandchildren, my  two brothers 
would had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard, 

and my parents never saw grandchildren, I did. 
So all the huma n relationships, and all the 
huma n events, were kind of disrupted. I ha
d a disjointed childhood at best. My brother 
had consequences of it, my si ster are similar, you know, so 
this is just one fa mily to, 
quote, just one fa mily, and there™s plenty 
of damage, and I repeat again, I did not 
[indecipherable] go through the 
personal horrors of people w
ho go through Auschwitz, or 
ber -- Buchenwald, and tell horrible stories,
 you know, on a personal basis or so. But 
that™s just a kind of little composite stor
y of one family and how it spreads, what 
happened to us, and how one takes it. 
 

Q: Well, I™m very grateful that you were willi
ng to -- to come  and do the interview, and -- 
 

A: Thank you for -- 

 

Q: -- I thank you very much. 

 

A: Okay, thank you. 

 

Q: And we™re going to take a br
eak and look at the photographs. 
 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Okay Charlie, describe this picture for us. 

 

A: This is a wedding picture of my parents,
 1922, in Frankfurt, with the extended fami l y 
there, and including in the b
ack right behind them, my moth
er™s sister and her husband, 
Rosie Goodman, and M orris Goodman, where my sister went after the war. Next to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
81 
 
 
Morris Goodma n is Pepi Berger, who -- with wh
om I stayed for one year in Holland, with 
her husband Josef Berger. And next to her 
is Mendel Siegma n, who is my father™s 
brother, with whose fa mily I stayed, star
ting in 1946 till 1962, w
ith his wife Suzie 
Siegma n, who is not in the picture, he wasn™t
 ma rried yet. This picture went through the 
war itself, because my cousin carried with
 him through certain concentration camps, and 
by good circumstances it was finally brought to 
our attention, so this was salvaged, and 
this is the kind of big collective origin picture. 
 
Q: And this picture? 

 

A: This is a portrait picture of
 my mother that was taken, I 
believe, after her marriage, I 
don™t know exact dates on this one. And it was this
 plus the next one 
from my father, was 
given to us by very, very close friends of 
my mother, who had it in
 their collection, and 
when we came back after the war to United St
ates, they wanted to ma ke sure that we 

have pictures of our parents, and they enla
rged it, and framed i t , I believe, and -- and 
have been with us since. They hang on a wall in our din -- living room.  
 

Q: Andthis? 

 

A: This is the companion picture of my father
, also given by the same  friends, Hansha Label 
Velk, who were close friends of my  mother, an
d this the only full faced pictur e I have  of 
my father as an adult after his ma rriage.  
 

Q: Okay, the picture on the left? 

 

A: On the left is a picture of my mother 
as a young girl, 1913, must have been 14 years old 
or so, and the [indecipherable] where she was 
raised in Switzerland. Both this and these 
other pictures are -- giv --
 were given to me  by my A
unt Rosie from Switzerland, my 

mother™s sister, who had it in her collection. W
ithout her I would not have any pictures of 
my mother in any stage of her life. 
 

Q: And the one on the right. 

 

A: The one on the right is 1922, most probably 
either be -- just before or after she was 
ma rried. Again, for -- formal posed picture.  
 

Q: Nowwho™sthis? 

 

A: This is my picture of my  brother, must 
be a half a year old or so, 1926. And that™s the 
only picture I have of my  brot
her. My other brother -- this 
one, ar -- Aron Er ik. My other 
brother Josef Trey, I don™t have a
ny pictures at all. I am -- mo
st probably didn™t have it in 
her collection, or they never found the occasionto give it to me . But that™s the only 

reme mbrance pictur e I have 
of my p -- late brother. 
 

Q: And this shot? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
82 
 
 
A: This shot at -- is a pictur
e of my father with a friend 
on the beach in Scheveningen. My 
father is on the right, the taller ma n, 
in 1924, just after he was ma rried. And the 
background picture of that big ci
rcular building is the promin
ent hotel in Scheveningen to 
this day, called The Curacao. Until World War tw
o, that™s all existed on the beach as far 
as the vi sible building, now it is all built up around it, so it doesn™t look as identifiable 
any more. But it™s only snapshot picture I have of my father. 
 

Q: And who is that? 

 

A: This is my mo -- late mother, 1940 picture, 
the latest picture [indeci
pherable] really close 
to before she was killed in Auschwitz a few 
years later. And again, 
that was given to me  
by my relative. We  have -- we carry no pictur
es with us -- we  didn™t carry any pictures 
with us during the war, obviously, and any fa mily
 pictures we had we -- either they were 
disposed or not given to
 us after the war.  
 

Q: And these pictures? 

 

A: These pictures are from 1946, must be early
 ™46, wintertime in Amsterdam, my uncle 
Moritz from Switzerland came to visit us, 
brought us lots of clothing, which we are 
wearing, and other goodies, and parading thr
ough the center plaza of Amsterdam. To the 
left I am, next is my uncle, and my sister 
Lily, and my brother Le
o. Wa sn™t that a nice 
visit. On the right? 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Is a picture taken after my sister left, otherw
ise she would have been 
in the picture, went -
- left to Switzerland. In the background, in th
e center, are my relatives, Pepi and Josef 
Berger with whom I st -- we s -- we st ayed 
for one year in Amsterda m. To the left, the 
woma n with the beret is Malka We inma nn, who 
kept close to us, both in Amsterdam,  and 
when she came  to United States, stayed w
ith -- fr iendly with us, on good -- very good 
terms. She is, I think, holding a -- a hand of
 the little nephew. And the woma n on the 
right is a sister of Pepi Be
rger, who was a Regina Felsen, 
or Feldrin, who ma rried during 
the war, and -- to a Dutch person, and she was part
 of the family as well. So this is a kind 
of contemporary Amsterdam picture. Contempor ary 1946. 
 

Q: And who is this good looking group? 

 

A: This is the wedding pictur
e of our daughter Dafna with her husband Dani. And next to 
Dafna is my  wife Gita. And Dafna i s  holdi
ng one of her nephews, Ayal, who is the 
youngest of our oldest daughter, who is sta 
-- sitting right be -- 
standing right behind 
Dafna and Dani, that™s At ara, right, and her 
husband Joel - Jody, right
 next to her, right. 
And their other three children 
are the boy with the 
sleeve -- shirts -- sh
irtsleeve is Ilan, 
shirtsleeve right behind me , right. And on the side, 
the girl with the white skirt, this is our 
oldest granddaughter -- the 
white skirt at the end, ne
xt -- behind my wife Gita. 
 

Q: Oh,here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0477  
83 
 
 
 
A: Right. That™s Michal. And in front are our tw
o other grandchildren, one of them is Ha dar, 
the small one, and that -- that™s the four ch
ildren of Atara and Jody. And next to her is 
Shlomit, and the little boy next to me  is Yose
f, who are the two children, at that time , of 
our daughter Naomi, in back and her husband Ari. 
 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

A: Right. This is Naomi, this is Ari. And on 
back, the last two next to Atara are our son, 
right there, tall fellow is next
 to a -- next to -- that -- 
 

Q: Here. 

 

A: -- that™s right. Our son Dov, 
and his wife Tzviya, right over 
there. That™s the last fami ly 
pictur e we ha d, but there -- since then, we 
have had, thank God, a few additions in the 
fa mily. Atara -- Dafna and Dani had -- to have two children, Amihi and Tahiwa. And 

Naomi had another son, Menachim Benjamin. So 
thank God the -- is a contrast that they 
have two wedding pictures, and this is the con
tinuity which Hitler trie
d to destroy, but we 
beat him. 
 

Q: [indecipherable] 

 

A: Left is my wife Gita and myself, and on the other s -- on the right is my wife Gita and 
myself again, different poses and formality. And 
this is the best part happened to my life 
when I met Gita, and she is 
all around superb blessing for 
all of us. And those are the 
bright chapters, opened with when I me t her, and 
then the family pictures since. So this is 
the continuity with a ma jor interruption, a
nd some fa mily tragedy between, but thank 
God that the bright side is 
that the continuity exists.
