Interv iew with Emanuel Mandel 
July 7, 2003 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: Okay. This is the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum, Jeff and Toby 
Herr collection. This is an interview with
 Emanuel Mandel, cond
ucted by Nina Ellis, on 
July 7
th
, 2003, in Silver Spring, Ma
ryland. This interview is part of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up 
interview to a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum videotaped interv iew, 
conducted with Emanuel Mand
el in 1989. The United St ates Holocaust Memorial 
Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and To
by Herr for making this interview possible. 
This is tape number one, side A.
 I™d -- in order to begin, I™d lik
e to ask you if -- if you, in 
the last 14 years since the inte
rview that I saw took place, is
 there anything about your 
experience during th e war that you™ve learned 
since then, that you™d like to go back and 
talk about it? Know -- how mu
ch you remember, exactly, abou
t your interview, but I™m 
assuming that you -- it was clear to me that
 you™ve been  doing research, and finding out 
mo re and mo re about what happ
ened to you, since you were 
so young. Is there anything 
that you might want to add 
to what you already did? 

Answer: Let me get to that in 
one mo ment, but let me also make a -- not a disclaimer, but 
a commercial statemen t in a sense -- 
Q: Okay .

A: -- in that I just want to acknowledge the 
importance, and I want to say than k you to the 
mu seum for doing this, because I have believed 
for some time that th
e archiving of this 
information is extremely important. And I™ve sa
id publicly, privatel
y, that even though 
every interviewee™s informati
on, including mine, may not be
 earth-shaking, or startling, 
the fact that it™s archiv
ed, and the technology is availabl
e to do it, is terribly important. 
How interesting it would be if I go to the -- 
whatever mu seum, take out a tape of a Civil 
War soldier, talking from the Civil War, not a 
mere reenactment, and we could learn so 
much. So I just want to acknowledge, and 
ex tend my  ap preciation for whoever sponsors 
this, and for the museum for doing it. I do unde
rstand now this has been now going on for 
maybe 10 years, these second in terviews. I 
really thought it was 
a brand new idea. But 
I™m delighted to do it. Let me get to the qu
estion that you asked. 
I don™t know if I™ve 
learned anything specific. Much of what 
I know about the Holo
caust, I know from -- 
from memory, and I™ve said before now, and I™ll 
repeat -- I™ll try not to repeat myself too 

frequently , to say that I was old enough to
 remember, because my
 memory apparently 
work s well, and mu ch  too young
 to understand. Wh ich makes yo -- me a survivor whose 
emotional scars are quite different than people
 my  age, and two, three, four years older, 
who in fact understood. I thought I was bei
ng a little pint sized hero for wearing a yellow 
star. I didn™t think it was a stigma. I couldn™t
 understand the concep t of stigma. I mean, I 
too have, like an adult, that™s a good th ing. A
ll six year olds want 
to be like big people. 
So it isn™t so much that I™ve 
learned a lot, although I™m sure I™ve learned certain things 
about myself, my fathe
r, my mother, and others, what I™ve 
done the last 14 years different

than before, and it™s not because of the inte
rview, was I be -- have become very much 
mo re involved in Ho locaust ki
nds of things, in order to 
make use of the survivors, 
because we are a dying population, and I can 
identify for you -- and again, I don™t think I 
did before, that the night that
 Steven Spielberg -- that™s a 
matter of just a coincidence, 
received the Academy Award for Schindler, he said
 that there are, at that time, as I think 
he said, 350,000 survivors, I 
guess, in the United States. An
d I was flabbergasted because 
in relative terms, it™s a very
 small number. I mean, 350,000people, and that™s a dozen 
years ago, whenever that was.
 So there are less today. And I said maybe I need to, in 
some way be involv ed, because I™m one of 
the younger survivors you™ll meet -- I™m only 
67 years old, do something to ar
chive, to use, to teach, becaus
e if we don™t, this is an -- 
this is an irreplaceable commod
ity. If we don™t do what we need to do, after we™re gone, 
it can be done, but differently. A second genera
tion experience is diff
erent than the initial 
experience that those of us who were there, 
in all the places, can tell. So I™ve become 
involved in a number of things
, but I think that™s the major 
change, since that time. Not 
so much what I™ve learned, 
but what I™ve done with it. 
Q: Uh-huh. Do you want to talk ab
out some of things you™ve done? 
A: Well, I have probably spok
en in a -- in a gazillion places
. I™ve been invo lved locally 
with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council,
 which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah 
commemo ration that™s six, seven, 800 peop
le, attendance thing, and all the largest 
synagogues in the community, 
I™ve chaired it for the last fi
ve years. And I did -- I™ve 
been a member of that commi
ssion fo r 15 or 18 years, but
 I thought maybe I™d like to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072

become mo re involved. And that involves wi
th  some other elements of the Ho locaust 
thing. Serve the museum, museum visits, muse
um volunteering, some other things. I have 
some connection with the legislature, as a c
onsequence I™ve tried to help the council, and 
the mu seum be involved with legislators to co
me to the mu seum, or to meet them there, 
or to speak with them
 there. These are things I™ve do
ne, I™ve -- anecdotally, one of the 
things I™ve done is our organiza
tions that have silent auctions, I™ve been a silent auction 

mu seum tour giver in any number of organiza
tions. If you bid on my  
particular offer, and 
it™s a winning offer, whatever the 
organization decides, I will in 
fact take a half a day, and 
take you and four other people to the mu seum
, and the mo st interesting group I had once, 
was a -- a woman, I forget what her organiza
tion was, she called, 
and we arranged, and 
there were four women, and I, all veterinarians. I don™t think they 
were Jewish, but they 

were involv ed in so me organization, and th ey wanted to see the mu seum, and I was there 
with four veterinarians. I had never been w
ith that many veterinarians in my life, women 
or otherwise. Just an intere
sting comb ination of people. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I™ve done that, I have probab
ly been involved in 
the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the 
three organizations that are Holocaust orga
nizations in the community. There is the 
Washington fre -- th-the survivors and frien
ds organization, with wh ich you may be 
familiar. There is a child survivors orga
nization, which cove
rs more Baltimore/ 
Washington, and there™s a second generatio
n. And now there is a third generation 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072

organization, and I have gotten to know some 
of the people, I™ve been
 involved in some 
of the meetings, some of the pl
anning, some of the conferences. 
Q: Uh-huh. That™s quite a lot, yeah. And do 
you talk with the scho
olchildren? Have you 
done any of that? 
A: Well, for example, recently there was a 
cooperative program within the co uncil and 
Comcast, and th e [indecipherable] Olney theate
r, here in Olney. And several high school 
classes were brought -- several high sc
hools, and th ey [indecipherable] 11
th
 grade class, 
were brought together for a -- an orientation, 
a talk, a -- a video, and 
after that they even 
did projects expressing the Holo caust in art,
 mu sic and design. An
d we spoke to those 
four schools. The next year, there were four 
other schools. These have been th ings that 
I™ve done. There was a training program, for 
example, for the Jewish Social Service 
Agen cy, JESSA, and five years ago, I think 
it was, when we spent four days, one day a 
week in four weeks, in a ve
ry comp rehensive training progra
m for their staff, including a 
visit to the mu seum, which I, as a volunteer put 
together for them, with a director of the 

agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the 

assumption that if they
 deal with Holo caust survivors, 
they ou-ought to
 know something 
about the Holocaust. 

Q: Is it possible for you to summarize what 
-- how people react to 
your presentations 
when you meet with them? People who may 
not know a lot about 
the Holocaust? I™m 
talking ab out groups asid
e from survivor groups. 
A: React in what way? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
7
Q: How do they react? I mean
, what do they want to know
, what -- what do they not 
know? What does it -- 
A: Well -- there are probably at least two 
major kinds of presen
tation, and I do one 
because I™m unable, or whatev
er to do the other. The -- t
hose presentations which are 
based in the emotional experience, but as I 
said to you, my emoti
onal experience at the 
time was very limited, I didn™t understand. So
 what I do is I do a much more -- not 
objective, but I guess it™s an objective approa
ch  to describing what happened, from the 
eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year ol
d kid. The reaction to that often is amazement, 
to the point, and this is again anecdotal, bu
t I spoke to whatever, 
the fifth grade Hebrew 
school class of my  synagogue. And the fifth grade Hebrew  school class, one of them, 

included my  grandson at the time. And he aske
d a question at the end.
 And he became so 
kind of involved in the desc
ription, he said, ﬁDid you su
rvive?ﬂ I™m his grandfather, I 
mean, he was like trying to ask, how did pe
ople survive, so he said to me, ﬁDid you 
survive?ﬂ He™s forgotten, I mean
, this could have been a movi
e that I was describing. So 
the reaction tends to be less visceral in some
 sense, and mo re factual, because I tend to 
present factually, rather than emotionally, fo
r many reasons, including the kind of person 
I am, and the nature of my experience, of 
people that I know in the community who are 
one, two, three, four, five years older th
an I, whose experience was different as a 
consequence, they present differently. 
Q: Mm-hm. That™s interesting. Let™s g -- let™s 
go back to your chrono
logy, if you will. It 
was 1949 when you came 
to this country with 
your mother and father. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072

A: Mm, well, my father came in 1948. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: My father -- we were all in, at that time,
 Palestine. Israel happened a few months after 
my  father left. My father came to this c
ountry  for two reasons. On
e stated, and one kind 
of unstated. The stated reason was, of the se
ven children, six siblings and my  father, two 
had died in 1930 of cause
s other than Ho locaust, two women, one married, one 
unmarried. Two brothers were k
illed during the war. One brothe
r was in Israel, my father, 
and the seventh child, the oldest, was in Philad
elphia. My aunt had come here in 1914, in 
some ways to be with so me cousins, to
 reduce the burden, which was difficult. My 
grandparents -- my  grandfather, I 
am told -- I never met him, he died befo re I was born, 
again for non-Holo caust related reasons, he
 died 1930. He was not a successful 
busin essman, and they had some very difficu
lt times. He became a -- kind of a county 
clerk of some sort, because he could read 
and write, and he knew Hungarian well, besides 
Yiddish and Jewish things, and it was difficu
lt to make a living. So  my  aunt came out 
here. My father wanted to see his survivin
g sister, whom he had not seen since 1914 
when  he was eight -- no, he was 10, and sh
e was 14 or 15, or something like that. The 
other reason was that my father, being a pr
ofessional cantor all his life, trained as a 
cantor, not just something he 
did part time, found that it 
was very difficult to make a 
living, because that™s one of the things Israel
 did not need too many
 of at the time. And 
he chose to -- he found a way to legally stay, 
he did, and then in ™49, my  mo ther and I 
came. Now we™re in New York .

A: Yeah. What do you rememb er getting off 
-- you were at Idlewild Airport. What do 
you remember when  you came in, and wh at 
were your expectations of the U.S.? 
A: I had no idea. I honestly had no idea. Reme
mb er that being of that age, and at that 

time, the number of movies that people saw 
-- I mean, movies were a -- a treat number 
one, and they were infrequent. And wh en I lived
 in Israel, went to the movie, and I can 
tell you the names of the movie theaters. But 
they were movies from various places, and I 
didn™t -- I didn™t have an understanding of wh
at the size of this country, the dimensions 
of this country, the o
pportunities of this country were, an
d I™m not sure that™s something 
that a ni -- nine year old would -- well, by 
that time I™m 13, but ev en a 13 year old 
wouldn™t know that. My orient
ation was much more in terms 
of European  recollections of 
things, and certainly this country  did not appear
 to be the same way. I was fascinating by 
-- first I came by plane. Now, I got on the pl
ane in a -- what had been a military airport 
outside of Haifa, two engine plane, flew to 
-- for refueling in Eg
ypt, for refueling in 
Tunis, from Tunis to Nice, from N ice to Bru
ssels. Spent overnight in Brussels, and from 
Brussels took th e big bird to Shan non, to 
Gander, in Newfoundland
, and then to New 
York. That was the typical way, but it was by 
plane. My father had 
come the year before, 
it took him three weeks, I think, by boat. 
But it was just a ques
tion of how people 
traveled. So you arrive at this place, and I 
remember waking up in
 the morning after an 
overn ight flight, and my  first 
inclination was, as I looked out
 the window, was to get out 
and walk, because the clouds looked like sheep. 
They looked s -- as so
lid as rocks. Now I 
knew that that™s not a good idea, and I didn
™t do it. But it was uneventful flight of -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
10
probably  the hop from Shan non
 to Gander mu st have be
en 10 hours. And then from 
Gander down, another six. We traveled probab
ly 30 hours all togethe
r. But we arrived in 
New York. Now, you have to re
member that Idlewild, which 
we now know as JFK didn™t 
look the same. It was kind of a little airport, 
because international f
lights had not been too 
common, one because the war had 
just ended, and two, that wa
s not the kind of aircraft, 
the jets hadn™t come in, not for another 10 years.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the prop-driven four engine
 planes had to make hop, to 
hop, to hop, to hop. It was 
still quicker than ship, but -- so 
we arrived. Now, at the airport, my father and my aunt, 
his sister, were waiting for us, and in a ma
tter of minutes, it seemed, we were kind of 
hustled by taxi -- that was not un
usual, taxis I knew, to Pennsy
lvania station, in the city, 
on a train, to Philadelphia, where we spent 
some time kind of getting acquainted. And I 
reme mb er seeing a sign on the bridge between 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in Trenton, 
which I couldn™t read then, but I had taken th
at train ride subsequently many, many times, 
and it says Trenton makes, the world takes. To
ok me years to figure out what that meant. 
But it was one of the initial things. In those da
ys when you went by 
train, or you went by 
subway, you had these various 
dispensing machines, mu ch le
ss sophisticated than what 
we have now. I was absolutely
 fascinated by the 
gum ma chine, wh ere you could put in a 
nickel or wh atever, couple pennies, and get Ch ic
lets. And I wanted to kind of do it all the 
time. I was fascinated byVene
tian blinds. I was fascinated 
-- certainly by television set, 
which my  aunt had, as I reme mb er, but we 
didn™t for awhile. Now, radios were not 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
11
unusual, radios were common. Cars were
 not unusual, although th e numb er were 
common. So  that the impressions you had -- wh
at I had is twofold, what I™ll leave you 
with. On e, the impressions of a 13 year old 
in a new place. And the impressions of a 13 
year old in a new place calledthe United States. I knew very little
 about the States yet, at 
the time. I didn™t begin to know ab out until we
 moved back to New York, after about two 
weeks of staying here, and my  parents took 
a sublet apartment, and I began to go to 
school. And I s -- we spent a year and a half
 in New York , I was in
 school for about a 
year. I came here in wh at would be equivalent 
to seventh grade. So  I finished seven B in 
New Yo rk, in those days with A™s and B™s. 
Did eight A in  New York , same school. I can 
tell you about that, too, because it had impact
, a significant impact. And then  we moved 
to Philadelphia where my father 
lived the rest of his life. My 
mother died in
 Philadelphia, 
and I was in Philadelphia until 1961, till I finish
ed grad uate school, and then  my wife and 
I, and daughter at the time, left to wn. 

Q: Tell me about going to school. 

A: Well, the point of school was that -- people 
think this is just words, but schools are the 
Mixmasters of society, particularly in a pl
ace like New York. Now, my father found a 
sublet apartment in the village.  

Q: Manhattan. 

A: Yes. Remember, my father™s congregation 
was on the east side of Rivington Street, 
had to be walking distance. 
Even though he performed in that congregation only once a 
month, it™s that kind of job. Still had to be
 walking distance. Duri
ng -- on other Sabbaths, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
12
we went to some local syna
gogue, a small one, whatever, 
in the neighborhood. But we 
are on -- on the village in the west side. We 
are in the heart of the famous part of the 
village, Bleeker Street, McDougall Street, an
d we were on Barrow St
reet, 72 Barrow. An 
apartment building where people were away, 
and we sublet their apartment. School 
became an important thing, obviously, and my father made some inquiries, I suppose, he 
was not familiar, for me to 
go to one of the Jewish-type 
day schools. And there were 
many of them in the general community, subw
ay rides. And I remember going to them, 
and I remember that one of them, I forget th e name, insignificant, said, ﬁWe will be glad 
to have the young man,ﬂ -- I mean, I was fl
uent in Hebrew -- ﬁwe™ll put him in third 
grade.ﬂ ﬁWhy?ﬂ ﬁWell, he doesn ™t speak Engl
ish.ﬂ Which is true. I had some knowledge 
of English, but very spo
tty, and very unreliable. 
Q: And either of your parents speak English?  
A: Well, my father had been here for a yea
r, and he spoke some. Again, street English, 
learned. My  mo ther didn™t, she knew less th
at I did. My mo the
r, by that time, spoke 
Hungarian, Serb, passable German. Not passa
ble, but somewhat street French from 
school. But she had studied knowing th at sh 
-- English was not taught in Europe when 
they were in school. I knew very little. I mean
, Trenton makes, the world takes, I could 
not read, then. I was 13, I was not, you know,
 an infant. But ther
e was somethi ng about 
the notion of third grade that didn™t make 
any sense for many reasons, not only the fact 
that I™d lose four years, I could probably make
 them up, but a 13 year old is not going to 
have anything in  common with a nine year old,
 or a 10 year old. There™s a difference, I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
13
mean, raging puberty was probably taking place, 
and all those other things that happen in  
early teens were taking place, and that did 
not put me into any kind of a connection with  
the younger kids. So my parents, somehow
, and I don™t recall -- I don™t -- I can™t 
reme mb er how they  discovered that the pub
lic school happened to  be exactly a block 
from the apartment. P.S. numb
er three, on Hudson Street. 
The principal was a Jew. I™m 
not sure that™s terribly significant, but there 
may have been  some -- I had with me a letter 
from Haifa, saying that I had comp leted so mu
ch of seventh grade, but the cu rriculums 
are different. The principal said the following,
 he said, ﬁWe™ll put him in seventh grade. 
We™ll give him an allowance, he will not ha
ve to take classes in Spanish.ﬂ Which was 
already being taught. ﬁIf he makes it, he™ll go 
to eighth grade, and if he doesn™t, he™ll 
repeat seventh grade, it™s pretty simp le.ﬂ
 Which made an awful lot of sense. And 
obviously I was able to pick up enough to  be
gin to go on, and kids, first of all, are 
spongelike, and you pick up. 
And one of the differences be
tween me and people who are 
three or four years older, who came here maybe
 after high school, or at the end of high 

school, you have different language pattern, 
you have a different kno
wledge of English, 
and people after 50 years, still speak like they
 got off th e boat. I never did a thing in my  
life to try to deal with the way 
I spoke, but I tried to learn th
e language as well as I could, 
so I have co mmand of it. In P.S. number thre
e, I could do th at. And 
that had significant 
impact in that I continued, at least age appr
opriately, as opposed 
to continuing in a way 
that was, you know, kind of as a sore thumb 
sticking out, a kid two feet taller than 
everybody else in the class, 
cause I was 13. So  that had ve
ry significant impact. Then I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
14
continued through public school 
in Ph iladelphia, and that™s -- we™ll get to that at some 
point if you wish, but that had an  important
 element. My father
 then decided that 
although he could have stayed at that cong
regation in New York, I guess indefinitely -- 
well not indefinitely, but certainly for awhile
, cause community had begun to change in 
some ways. He thought that he would like to
 live in a community, so his wife and son 
could have a life in a community, and New Yo rk
 is not a community in that sense, not 
when  you™re there once a month, and you ha
ve nothing else to do. We moved to 
Philadelphia in 1950, and I spen t the next 11 
years in Philadelphia with my  parents, and 
well, eventually 
with my wife. 
Q:  What was it like for you to be in school 
there, not speaking English at first, and -- did 
you feel like an outsider, did they -- 
A: No, because the kid next to me was fro
m China, and the kid 
next to him was from 
Italy, and the kid next to him was from 
some Span ish speaking -- and I remember 

vaguely these two kids, the Italian and the 
-- I don™t even know if it was a Chinese 
youngster, but he™s certainly an Oriental kid,
 he could have been 
Korean, I don™t know. 
But he came -- he wasn™t in school one day.
 Next day he comes in, and I say to him, 
ﬁWhere were you yesterday?ﬂ He says, ﬁI pl
ayed hooky.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ I sa
ys, ﬁwith a stick?ﬂ I 
didn™t know the wo rd hooky, but I learned 
the wo rd hooky from my  Ch inese friend, who 
was playing hooky, okay? 
Q: Hello. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
15
A: Oh, you want a -- maybe 
mink or something, but you
™re asking about -- you asked 
about the reaction of the other kids, my  re
action to them. New Yo
rk was probably the 
best -- in one way it™s the best place to break 
in. I suppose Iowa wo uld have been  just as 
good in the differences. That would have 
been  incredib ly consistent. I would have 
learned Iowa. In New York  you had a conglo
meration of every kind of person, even in  
those days. Maybe not the propor
tions as today, but certainly in the village, and this was 
in the village. It™s -- th e village was the villa
ge, it may not have been what it has become 
since -- we™re talking for over -- over 50 year
s ago. So I learned a lot. I -- my parents 
bought me a bicycle. You recall a bicycle stor
y from a different [indecipherable] tape th at 
you had seen, and I rode ar
ound downto wn  Manhattan, all 
over God™s creation without 
any concerns,  I mean, as long as I didn™t
 run into buses. And I learned ab out the 

community. I learned about the wharf, and I lear
ned about the this and the that. And I was 
a curious George. I made friends with the 
man who ran the little hardware store across 
the street o n  -- on Hudson Street, because I wa
s in there probably fi
ve times a week for 
things having to  do with my  bicycle, which 
needed to be polished,
 oiled, lubed, plugs 
changed daily. Slight ex aggeration,
 but it was a very busy, and --  
Q: You loved that bike.  

A: I did. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: It -- it w as -- it was my some sense of fr
eedom, and I could do anything I pleased. I 
didn™t have a large number of friends at that
 point. Little later on, when we moved to the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
16
East Side, because we went into
 an apartment where we stayed
 for the rest of our time in 
New Yo rk, which was an old brownstone on 11
th
 Street. I had two or three friends that I 
had some contact with, but we went to diffe
rent schools. And life tends to be mo stly 
going to school, and coming hom
e, and having a little bit of 
time. And again, 50 years 
ago, the kind of freedom, I mean, none of th e 
kids went for vacations in Fort Lauderdale, 
at least not then, and I was 
too young to do that on my  
own anyhow. But we went -- 14
th
 
Street in New York  was sti
ll a major demarcation line between the lower East Side, and 
lower Manhattan, on -- further up. And we we nt to all the places. I remember taking -- 
taking -- I asked my  parents to go to the movi
es with me, which th ey did. And we saw 
two and a half hours of cartoons. And I s
till don™t know how they
 surviv ed that. 
Q: Can you describe how th e transition was for 
your parents? Do you 
have much sense of 
that, of -- you said your father, 
within a year wanted to  go 
to Ph iladelphia because he felt 
he would have mo re of a commu nity. Was he 
having a hard time adjusting there, or was 
it just a function of the work wasn™t
 exactly what he wanted it to be? 
A: No, it™s not the work, the 
work was very much what he
 wanted . Community  in that 
sense meant having friends that you could liv
e in a neighborhood with, shopping that you 
did in a neighborhood when  you
 knew the place, organizati
ons wh ere you got involved . 
New Yo rk is not that kind of a community. In
 a peculiar way, neither is Washington. But 
the cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, 
Boston, and so forth, have histories as -- 
Baltimore -- are communities. There are ce
rtain rules about th
em, there™s certain 
elements, and certain 
ebb and flow to them. And that
™s what I meant he wanted a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
17
community. The position in New 
York , the job in  New York , was a star position. I mean, 
this was the -- not quite, but it was the Metrop
olitan Opera version of the cantor at the -- 
the time. I mean, you appear on
ce a month, and the rest of 
the time you can do anything 
you damn  please. But he wanted to be based 
in  someplace where he has some bricks, and 
some mo rtar, and some other kinds of roots 
that he can sink -- having now started his 
career for the third time. 
Q: Do you know how he -- 

A: Once in Europe, once in 
Israel, and once here. Yes? 
Q: How did he get that job? Do  you know? 
A: Yes, he came on a -- he came not as a landed immigrant, he came with a visitor™s visa. 
How mu ch detail do you want about how he stay
ed? If you™re interested, I™ll tell it to you 
briefly. 
Q: Tell me briefly, and then we can go. 
A: For whatever it™s worth, the cantor of
 the day was not a recognized minister of 
religion, the rabbi was. Rabbis had non-quot
a entry possibilities in terms of the Walter 
Maccaren Immigration act. A rabbi could come here, non-quota, bring his family, a 
cantor could not. My father had been ordain
ed as a rabbi twice in Europe, at very 
respected ye -- Yeshivas, one of them in Bra
tislava, well known. It was never done for 
professional reasons. It was not at all unus
ual to have somebody become a ordained 
lawyer, physician, businessman, 
accountant, bookkeep er or chem
ist. In his field it wasn™t 
a bad idea to have that kind of background
. My cousin -- my aunt™s son, who was a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
18
Philadelphia lawyer, with all the 
t erms that that means, was ab
le to research the law, and 
was able to find that as a ordained rabbi, no
 matter what he does for a living, he could 
enter non-quota. The rabbi of th e congrega
tion in New York, eventually gave him a 
position of being the associate rab b i so he co
uld come. So I™m saying that that™s how he 
could stay in New York , and this happened
 before we arrived. How he got the job 
originally  was that on a recomm endation, he 
was asked to do a particular piece of -- of 
the liturgy, which happens once a 
month. It is called the Yom 
Kippur cattan. It is a -- 
every month there is a Yom Kippur that™s done
 -- not any mo re, but it used to be, and he 
performed that. He performed it as a volunte
er, he performed it because somebody said, 
ﬁHey, you ought to listen to hi
m.ﬂ And on that basis they de
cided to offer him position. I 
think he performed in other places as well, 
b u t he was able to get that without much 
difficulty, and as far as the job was concerned,
 and the income, that was fine. It was the 
community that was missing, and that was se
 -- that was given, or that was made 
available by the existence of Philadelphia -- 
remember, I had an aunt, an uncle, three 
cousins, and their families. So that came 
with an instant kind 
of a set of roots. 
Q: Mm-hm. So the transition to
 Ph iladelphia was not difficult. 
A: No. For me the tran sition to Philadelphia 
was not difficult. Certainly it was an easier 

transition than the previous several. You 
know, from Switzerland to a kibbutz, from a 
kibbutz to a city, from a city 
to New York. That was much 
more difficult. But no, I met 
sa --

End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Emanuel Mandel. This is tape number one , si
de B. You were saying wh en th e tape cut 
off that you went to junior high school -- 
A: That I met some friends in
 Philadelphia, in s -- in eighth grad e, and one of them -- a 
couple of them, but really one 
of them is still my very best
 friend. Unfortunately he lives 
on the west coast. He™s a retarded pe -- a re 
-- retarded -- he™s a retired pediatrician. And 
Bill and I keep in close contact, and we expect
 to see him later this month, we™re going to 
be in San Francisco, and th ey were here last
 month. So , that™s a friendship that™s 50 years 
old, and we maintain it as well as we possi
bly can. And there were others, the other -- 
typically in 50 years, you™re not going to maintain your whole high school class. But the 
transition to Philly, to 
the best of my recollection, fro
m that point of view, was easy. 
There were some other things that were 
difficult, probably w
ith my educational 
background, and in some ways the lack of it,
 and wh at I saw probably subconsciously as 
my -- as my targets in life. Want 
me to continue on th at direction? 
Q: Yeah, tell me about that. 
A: Came to New York -- came from New York
 to Ph iladelphia, did okay in school, 
nothing unusual, however, interestingly, th
e neighborhood in  wh ich I lived, and for 
Philadelphians, all I have to sa
y, I lived in Logan, and I ev
entually went to Central High 
School. Now, that™s a whole thing by itself, 
and that™s a keyword to anybody who knows 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072

Philadelphia. If you don™t, it doesn
™t matter, and if you do, that
™s a -- it™s the origin of the 
magnet school idea. It™s a city-wide school 
[indecipherable]. That high school was 
equidistant to my  house to the zoned high school that everybody from the neighborhood 
went to. My friends went to Central. They left
 junior high school -- 
in those days junior 
high school ended in ninth grade, I went to
 -- or eighth grade, but you could stay for 
ninth. You could start high sch
ool ninth or tenth. That™s si
gnificant, as I recall -- as I 
think back, that my friends we
nt -- the two or three friends 
that I maintain contact with, 
went from Jaku Junior High School to Central in
 ninth grade. The counselor at that junior 
high school, Mr. Cotler by name, in his attempt to
 be kind and to be nice, said to us, ﬁI 
would recommend that he go to  Central High 
School, but next year
. Ninth grade would 
be good for him in junior high school, becaus
e let™s face it, his English is not as perfect, 
his writing is not as perfect, I mean the kid ha
s been here for a year.ﬂ It was one of the 
largest mistakes I ever made. 

Q: Why? 

A: Because the whole style of the school was 
formed in ninth grade. When I arrived as 
one of maybe two or three newcom
ers to that class, to the 10
th
 grad e class, I was one of 
two, or th ree, or four kids who joined in 10
th
 grade, everybody else was in ninth grade. 
And the adjustment, and the acad
emics -- strictly academic 
high school. We had no non-
academic course, it was the original high sc
hool wi -- where the 
Ford program, which 
later became the accelerated program, was in
troduced. I had major difficulties for two 
reasons. I think it took me awhile to catch
 up, and I spent summer schools in summer 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
21
school because I had to make up one course 
or two. And secondly, 
I was very concerned 
-- not in a conscious way, of fitting in. As a 
consequence, the social
 and the -- not just 
social in terms of social with -- it™s a all boy™
s high school, none of us minded th at. Public 
school, all boys. It™s a whole 
other story. But the point is that I -- none of us missed the 
girls, so it wasn™t just a social with girls th
at we were trying to deal with at 14 and 15, 
which is the appropriate time to do that, but th
e other social things that take place among 
boys, [indecipherable] concerning sports, co
ncerning various kinds 
of things that boys 
begin to become involved with, quite appropriat
ely, was important for me to be part of. 
Well, you could only do so many th ings in 24
 hours. As a consequence, I think that I 
would have had a -- an easier 
high school career had I gone 
during ninth grade, and if I 
wasn™t so conscious, at least subconsciously
 on adjusting to beco
me one of the gang, 
where I didn™t do anything 
to become one, but it was cert
ainly a drive, because I had 
recently been elsewhere, and I™d
 recently been different, quite different. And I -- I want to 
be sure that I say that in terms of my own 
experience, I wasn™t concerned about doing this 
in any conscious way, but I™m absolutely co nvin
ced in retrospect that in some way, I had 
a certain amount of catching up to  do, wh ich 
then slowed  down  some other things.  
Q: Right. How did your difficulties manifest it
self? Just -- were yo
u unhappy, were you -- 
A: No, no. I don™t think -- no. 
Q: Did you have trouble in -- in class?  
A: I think that I did not do -- well, I know I -- I -- I think -- I didn™t do very well in high 
school, I was no scholarship student. I don™t th
ink I was the smartest kid in class, nor the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
22
dumbest kid. I was an average kid. I unders tood. But somehow, when it came time to 
spend time on th is or that, in terms of  hom
ework and other things, I spent less than I 
should have. Not at -- all th
e time, and not all -- every year. I had a marvelous high 
school experience. My three years in Centra
l High School -- and I graduated from Central 
High School, were as important to me as any 
schooling, and that™s the only school I have 
any feelings about, in terms of wanting to ha
ve any kind of connection. I mean, I would 
consider going to
 next year™s 50
th
 reunion. I certainly would 
not consider going to the 
reunion of Temp le University, 
Penn State University, or the 
Univ ersity of Pennsylvania, 
all of which I attended, and some of wh ich ev
en gave me a piece of sheepskin . I have no 
particular connection with them, or with it™s 
-- or with classmates. So Central is very 
important, it was a formative -- as it should 
be, but also a transformative time for me, 
because of where I came from, w h ere I had b
een, and what I was. I remember only one 
kid that I can recall, who had an  experience
 similar to mine, but I don™t know all the 
details of it, who also had be
en born overseas. Only one ki
d I can rememb er, in a school 
that because it was a city-wid
e school was quite eclectic in
 it™s combination of whites, 
blacks, Jews. Not -- I can™t recall any Hispanic
 kids, because there just weren™t any in  
Philly at the time, and not too 
many Oriental -- or Asian, or 
whatever you want to call, 
youngsters at the time, because there weren™
t any. There were so
me, but not enormous 
numbers. It was a white, middle class school.

Q: How -- what was your -- what was your fa
mily life like during th
ose years, and your 
parents, di -- did they  become part of the 
community, the way your 
father wanted to do, 
and was that a significant 
thing for you at that age? 
A: Yes and no. Yes, in that I think my father 
in fact, was able to ac
hieve what he wanted, 
and my  mother with him, a sense of commu n
ity involvement, and the -- all the various 
social and other kinds of orga
nizations and things that -- 
and I™m not going to  enumerate 
what it takes to be a member of a community
, but we were not housebound, and we were 
active in this, that, and the other thing. An
d they -- my  parents became involved in a 
association of survivors there, and all kinds of
 Jewish kinds of things. My father became 
very active in the cantor™s organizations, ch
airing the local group, ev entu ally becoming 
the national president of the can tor™s assembly. This is after I left home, but he was very 
active, and very involved, and if you talk to 
any cantor today who is over the age of 50 -- 
cause the younger ones don™t know him, but
 the -- would know Yehudah Mandel. He was 
very well known, and very well respected, 
and did fine. The community , the synagogue 
was a majo r synagogue. Not a ma jor synagogu
e, but a significant synagogue in town . 
Q: How so? 
A: Because it had been there for 50 years, an
d it had a tradition that people came back to 
it even after they moved away
. It was not one of the mo st prestigious, or one of the 
wealthiest synagogues, cause it 
was not in the wealthy part of
 town. Interestingly, it did 
not choose to rebuild  in the suburbs. When  
it came time for the syna
gogue to essentially 
die, it was sold, and it™s holdings were transf
erred to another synagogue, so there was no 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
24
second generation of that
 synagogue an ywhere. It was built 
in ™24, I think, 1924. And in 
1970-something, 50 years later, 
it just out -- ran out of it™s 
usefulness in that community, 
and it™s holdings were transferred to another 
synagogue in the city , not in the suburbs, 
actually. Philadelphia™s a very large, physical,geographic place. But 
it ceased to exist as 
a synagogue, but for the years my father was th
ere, 35 years, it was. So that was very 
much so -- one of my limitations was that 
being from a observant family, there were 
many things I didn™t do. I didn™t go to the rest
aurants -- as little as p eople did, but I didn™t 
go to  the hotdog stands, and I didn™t do this, 
and I didn™t do that, and I wasn™t available 
Friday night, and Saturd ay mo rn ing I didn™t go
 to the ballgame. Ther
e were things that I 
did not do, because they did, 
and I didn™t. Eventually that 
changed to some degree, but 
there was always a little bit of
 an overtone, not a stigma -- 
Q: Did you chafe against that in any way? 
A: Chafe, no, resent to some small degree, or 
found some restriction, 
yes. But then again, 
one of my  f -- good friends lived across the st
reet, was six foot three at the time. He 
chafed against being so tall, because that wa
s unusual. The center of the basketball team 
was six the -- three, and today six foot thre
e is a midget. So th
e question is how one 
chafes against things. I wouldn™t say I chafed
 against it, I think th
at I recognize it, and 
most of my buddies re
cognize it as well, and say, ﬁWe
ll, where are you going to be 
Friday? Oh, I -- I know you, Frid
ay you have to be in synago
gue, right?ﬂ ﬁThat™s right.ﬂ 
You know, you™re singing in th e choir, your fa
ther™s choir, I did that for awhile, those 
kinds of things. So  people understood. My  
circle of acquaintances, and the circle of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
25
acquaintances of my friends were in th
e Jewish community, 99 percent. I cannot 
reme mb er being in the home of a non-Je
wish kid in high school. And it was not a 
religious -- you know, it was not an observan
t th-thing, nor was there any kind of an 
injunction against. It™s just they weren™t part
 of our friendship groups. I didn™t have any 
black friends, lots of acquaintances, played 
on th e teams with them, but I had no contact 
with them, they lived ov
er there, and I didn™t. Wherever 
that was, the over there. And the 
other differences were limited. I certainly ha
d no church connection, which is where a -- 
my  non-Jewish friends gathered, and variou
s organizational things, and I didn™t go to 
Catholicism class, an d I didn™t
 go to, you kn
ow, to mass.  
Q: Did you -- how did you iden tif
y yourself at that time? Did you
 think of yourself as an 
American right away , or did you -- did it take awhile for that to happen?  
A: In some ways -- and again, I thought abou t this in terms of today™s conversation, in 
some ways I™m not sure I™ve ever consider myself labeled. Ther
e™s no question in my 
mind that everybody sees me, a
nd I am in fact, and have been
 for the last 50 some years, 
an American, more so than a
nything else. But every once in
 awhile my  good friend on the 
west coast will call me that 
crazy Hungarian kid. So ther
e are some glitches in that 
perfect -- I mean, they™ll call my
 wife something, too, but th
ey call her crazy New Jersey 
kid. At least that™s in this country. Bu
t there are some things
 that I™ve probably 
maintained -- retained, that I™m
 not even conscious of. I never -- and I repeat because it™s 
important for me to repeat to myself, I ne
ver consciously tried to acculturate, or to 
assimilate in anything that I did, by speech,
 or by dress, or by 
manner, or by behavior. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
26
That just happened. But I thi
nk underneath it there was always an element, and still is, of 
the first 10 years of my life, and the firs
t eight years in Europe, the first 13 years 
overseas, and th e subsequent years here. You want to rememb er also, that 
developmentally, a kid changes mo re in the firs
t 15 years of his life. Once he gets to be 
kind of an  adult, he tends to be the same  for 
al -- as long as he liv es. But the changes, the 
developmental tasks of infancy, childhood, a
nd later of adolescence, and there are such 
things, kind of need to  take place by th e time 
you™re 18 - 19, or 20. And from that point 
on, you either are or you 
aren™t. And I hope I am.  
Q: When  you were approach in
g the end of high school, how did you think about your 
future? 
A: Well, I was going to be an engineer. No 
question. If you look at my  high school 
yearbook, it says, career path, engine
er. Only problem was I had an -- 
Q: What did that mean to you, 
engineer, what kind of engineer? 
A: Well, he tinkers. An engineer tinkers. I 
had no idea that an engineer sits behind a 
drafting board for two, or three, or four, or
 five years, in an engineering firm, going 
absolutely bonkers. Wh
en I began to become somewhat fa
miliar with that, I said I don™t 
think I want to be an engineer. Aptitude-wis
e, apparently -- I mean, I don™t recall the 
particular scores, and cuda pref
erence tests, and strong vocatio
nal tests and things of that 
nature. Tests with which I™m familiar for ot
her reasons. I think I 
scored okay on math, 
and physics, and other kinds 
of things like that. But I r
eally -- and I am sure that 
subconsciously again, by fo rma
tive previous years, had some
thing to do with, I thi -- I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
27
thought I wanted to go onto so
me kind of human services, 
not engineering serv ices. And 
I thought I wanted to, 
in some way wo rk with people, a
nd not with things, wh ich I did. 
And I transferred into a liberal arts program. 
Q: In college? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm, you started in an engineering program? 
A: Well, the first year of any college, engineer
ing or anything else, is the same  thing, you 
take English 101, math 101, everything else 101,
 but in the first year. Now, what I did, I 
wanted to  be very mu ch  independent in a sense of paying for school. 
Q: Right. 
A: Now, one of the advantages I had, having
 come from Israel, and 
the background that I 
had, I was a Hebrew school teacher. Full tim
e, which [indecipherable] 10 hours a week. 
Four to six four days a w
eek, and 10 to  12 on Sunday. In
 that amount of 10 hours of 
work, I was able to make as mu
ch as some of my buddies w
ho worked 20 or 30 hours in 
grocery stores, and after school jobs, because 
the rate was higher. I mean, I probably have 
earned as mu ch as 900 dollars a year, but 
900 dollars a year wa
s two years worth of 
college, because my  first year at Penn Stat
e, was 410 dollars, 205 dollars a semester. So 
I™m saying I was able to do what I wanted, na
mely pay for it myself. My parents, though 
they were getting to be a little 
bit more comfortable as time 
went on -- this is 1 9 55, my 
father had been here five years, his salary
 was acceptable, he was teaching in  the school, 
he did concerts, he did this, and appearance
s, and what. And I th
ink that they were, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
28
economically, certainly 
comfortable, and remember, th ey 
didn™t spend a great deal of 
money eating out, because restaurants weren™
t kosher, and it wasn™t the tradition. I mean, 
this is before the fast food av alanch e, and ev
erybody didn™t go out to fe -- Chinese food, 
you know, three times a week. 
I™m not sure they do it today either, but still. Anyhow, I 
was able to fund a certain amount of school, a
nd I was able to then go to a school that 
was as close to being away from home as 
I could think of. Penn State University had 
campuses throughout the state, in cluding one
 in oga -- at the Ogontz campus in 
Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, commu ting distance fro
m my  house. I had one in Eerie, and in 
Dubois. Several centers were you could go for tw
o years, and then  you have to  transfer to 
the main campus at state college, or transfer
 to some other university. So for two years I 
had this idyllic life, fro m whatev
er in the morning, until three 
o™clock in the afternoon. At 
four o™clock I had to go teach. And I was out
 of school [indecipherable] that I would 

either drive up there, or my father would pi
ck me up or something. It was arranged, and 
not a problem. But I had this idyllic life on 
this tiny little campus of
 maybe 300 kids. It 
had been the Ogontz School for Girls. And miss --  
A: O -- O - g - o - n - t - z, Ogontz, Indian na
me. It™s a section of Ph iladelphia. And Mrs. 
Suth erland, or Miss Sutherland,
 who had been  the headmist
ress of the Ogontz school, 

lived on the property, 
in this little castle-like building, a
nd sh e had rights to live there for 
the rest of her life. When she died, I don™t kn
ow wh at happened to  the place. But this was 
-- and we had a gazebo, and a lake, and ducks. 
It was the most idyllic kind of life that you 
could think of, for a couple of years. Then re
ality kicked in, I was 
not going to go up to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
29
the campus, because I would have 
had to lose my teaching job. It was important to me. I 
transferred to Temple Univers
ity when I finished the underg
raduate work that I did. And 
Temple University in those days was 475 dollars
 a year. So again, I could afford that. But 
you ask about what I did in my  
first year. At Ogontz, at Penn 
State, I transferred -- I can™t 
remember now whether it was in 
the first semester, or the seco nd semester. As I made out 
programs for my second year, I moved in to
 -- more into the hu
manities, and into 
sociology, psychology and things. But even  in
 your second year, things are pretty well -- 
re-requirements, you don™t have 
-- and this is 1955, this is 
not 1995, or 2005, wh ere, you 
know, kids go to  school and take one class a 
y ear, and then go back for basket weaving 
two. I mean, there are many jo -- 
they do this the high school, 
and in el -- in -- literally in 
the mel -- elementary school, the choices of cu
rricula. Well, there w ere less choices, and 
in my  second year, I don™t recall exactly, but 
I do rememb er that I moved aw ay from the 
physical science, into 
the social science.  
Q: And living at home? 
A: Living at home. 

Q: The whole time? 
A: Living at home, the whole time. Never a 
thought of living away  from home. And I™ve 
often thought whether that was an issue of my  choice, or I just couldn™t conceive -- I can 
tell you this  mu ch, that I certainly didn™t
 think of living away from home as an 
expression of independence. I was very inde
pendent at home, and I guess I had lived in  
enough different situations, that 
I didn™t have to prove th e fact that I in fact could find my  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
30
way on my  own, by living away . And I thi
nk economica lly it was not a good idea. I 
mean, where was it going to  go? There are some people in Ph iladelphia who lived at 
Penn -- Univ ersity of Pennsylvania, who are c
ity residents, you know, who lived  a half an 
hour from the -- as people here live at college 
park. If I was in college these days, I never 
would commute. I™m sorry -- I would always
 commu te, I would never be a resident 
student at college park. My kids were reside
nt students at the universities, but they at 
least were outside of commu ting 
distance. So my wife, interestingly, I mean just as a 
contrast, although th is -- it™s no impact on 
me, I hardly knew he
r then, commuted to 
school, although she had a scholarship to a
ttend any university -- a
ny state university in 
New Jersey. She was [indecipherable] she ha
d a Regent™s scholarship. Sh e could have 
gone to New Brunswick, from the Newark area 
where she was raised, and been  a resident 
student. Because of a number of things, she c
hose to live at home. So interesting, we 
were both commu ting student
s as undergraduates. 
Q: Mm-hm. During these years -- first coupl
e years of college, and you™re still work ing 
every day, teaching? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: You™re still thinking about what it is you
™re going to  do, you haven™t completely -- 
that idea hasn™t really 
formed in your mind? 
A: I wish I could identify for you at what 
point I began to make mo re of a concerted 
direction decision. Probably when I wo -- when
 I transferred -- when I finished two years 
at Penn State, and as I said, I couldn™t stay ther
e any longer, I had to either transfer to the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
31
main camp u s at college park, or transfer to 
any place else that would accept me, and I 
was [indecipherable] acceptable things. I transf
erred to Temple University, which is the 
commu ting school in Ph iladelphia. And I™m trying
 to think of wh ether it was a particular 
teacher, or particular curriculum that got 
me involved in what was another Ford 
Foundation trial program. I am currently, 
and have for the last 45 years been a 
professional social worker. I™ve been in priv
ate practice now for 20 years. I say that 
because that™s where I got to 
because of what I decided th
en. There was some kind of a 
program in the school of education departme
nt of secondary education, wh ich comb ined  
majors in sociology, psycholo
gy, political science, history 
and economics. That attracted 
me, as a -- this kind of a [inde
cipherable] thing. No w, at the end of th at comp letion, you 
could practice teaching, become a teacher, wh
ich I did not do. Myundergraduate degree 
is as a bachelor of science in education.I was a qualified, but not certified teacher in 
Pennsylvania. Had I practiced o
tt, I would have become certifie
d, I think, in history or 
something. So that attracted me
, the choice was to do that, and the other choice was to go 
to school of social work in graduate progr
ams. And at the time th
ere was really only one 
school in Philadelphia, that was the University
 of Pennsylvania. As this is going on, and I 
think back to  a couple of people at the unive
rsity, who were instrume
ntal in talking with 
me about these things, and these are program
s that some  of the courses had practicums 
attached, in the field of social serv ice, in the field of social 
welfare, in the field of social 
work. I began to think more a
nd mo re in relation to maybe doi
ng that. I knew I™d have to 
go to  grad uate school, which didn™t bother me
 conceptually. I was 
a little worried about 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
32
the fact that the United Stat
es army might interfere. And 
I was very concerned if my  
career in school is interrupted, will I go back 
to school afterwards, and there™s no way to 
guarantee that, I took th e deferment exam, I did 
everything I could. I wouldn™t say that I 
had a daughter for that purpose, but that didn™
t hurt, because here I was 23 years old or 
something, or wh atever, and with a wife a
nd a fami ly, and I had to sign a commitment up 
to the age of 35, but I wasn™t drafted. There 
was a reaso n  why I wasn™t drafted, which is 
nothing to do with my choices. Informati
onally, as another one of the homogenizing 
elements in  my life, at Penn State, it be
ing a land grant institu
tion, it required all 
freshmen, and so phomo re men to participate in
 reserve officers training program, ROTC, 
in World War two uniforms. So Wednesdays
, I was Lieutenant Mandel of th e horse 
cadets. As a consequence, because I was 
in a military program, quote unquote, I was 
skipped when my  draft number came up -- not th
e lottery, this preced
es the lottery. This 
is right after Korea, and the calls were limit
ed. You know, two or three people per draft 
board . So  they never called me, and by the time 
I got done with this, two years later, all 
the 18 and 19 year olds were ahead of me on th
e list, so I was never called, I was never ca 
-- I w -- took an army  physical, I was a one-A , a
nd I did all the things in those days that 
all of us did. So me of my  friends signed 
up on various pr-plans
, they would postpone 
induction until they finished sc
hool and then go in. Some to
ok a six month program to get 
done with the active service,
 and then go to  reserve mee
tings for seven years. I did 
neither, and lu
cked out. 
Q: At what age did you become a citizen? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
33
A: 18. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: The rules stated that you 
could become a citizen at 18 
on your own if 
you had been  
here for five years. If y ou were here for five
 years before you were 18, you could beco me 
a citizen on your parent™s papers. But I was sw
orn in to this da -- the federal court in 
Philadelphia in December of 1954 -- ™54, yes.  

Q: Was that a significant, memorable moment for you? 

A: I gotta tell you th at I have to think abou
t it, because I haven™t thought about it daily. 
I™ll tell you two things about the day. One, I 
certainly felt more Am
erican that day, not 
because of the swearing in, 
but because who else was be
ing sworn in. I was, as I 
remember, the only recently grad
uated high school kid being 
sworn, everybody else was 
older. There were two guys who were in Ai
r Force uniforms, who had to renounce their 
titles in the Czech royalty
. They couldn™t be Count PFC, th
ey had to be Mr. PFC. There 
was a rule, you cannot hold a title 
in the States, but they were 
already in the Air Force, or 
maybe the army -- I th ink in the Air Force. I 
-- but there were other people were there, 
they were all older now, and older probably  by 
th ree, four, five years, or 30 years, but not 
anybody my age, and I was an
 American kid for whom this was a right of passage, no 
problem. I didn™t have any difficulties with 
the three questions they
 asked me, which may 
have been what™s the highest 
court in the country , and what are the highest legislative 
bodies in Washington? Remember, I was living
 in Philly, not in Washington. It was an 
easy th -- it was a non -- i -- it was a non -- 
how do -- it was not, as I reme mb er it, an 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
34
emotionally important kind of thing. I didn™t 
have my  parents with me. I didn™t go to th eir 
swearing in. It was a routine that you had to  
do, like renew your driver™s license. It was 
equally emotional, because I fe
lt so very comfortable with 
where I was, and how I went, 
and who I was, and wh at I knew in terms of 
the American life. It w asn™t a sheltered 
existence in my own self-mad
e ghetto, wh atever ghetto that is, as many people do. I™d 

been involved in the swearing 
in ceremonies here, because of a commission I served on at 
one time. And it™s interesting to see the people 
now, that™s a very different world, but still 
you see the ghettos that come. The Thai commun
ity comes to the swearing in of it™s Thai 
people, and the Cambodians 
to the Cambodians, and to 
the Salvadorians to the 
Salvadorians. I didn™t feel that I was 
a member of any of those communities. 
Q: That™s interesting, yeah. 
A: But I really -- I have to tell you I™ve no
t thought ab out -- I know it was Decemb er 
1954, and I re-remember the -- the -- the U.S. 
court, but I don™t rememb er anything about 

it that would have been  remarkable. Maybe the 
wo rd is unremarkable, 
to me. But again, I 
was the only kid that I can remember, there wa
s a high school -- just recently graduated 
high school kid, I guess I was at Penn  St
ate, I don™t reca -- call what day it was. 
Obviously to ok the day, and I took care of it.
 But I didn™t make any kind of a thing about 
it. As I said, my  parents didn™t come with me , not because they had to take me, but 

because it wasn™t that -- important yes, significant, no.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
35
Q: Right. During these years, were your pa
rents weighing in with thoughts about what 
you should do in  college, or were those deci
sions left pretty mu ch up to you? Did you 
discuss those kinds of things 
with your parents very mu ch? 
A: I™m sure I did, and I™m sure that it was 
a n on-significant discu
ssion. I know that my 
father said to me when I wa
s at graduate school, he says
, ﬁI don™t know what social 
work ers do, but I have a feeling that it may not
 be the most lucrativ
e thing for anybody to 
do. So I have a recommendation. Start on your 
second million. Takes 
all the pressure off 
making the first.ﬂ Right? I took up his advice, a
nd I™ve done ex actly what he told  me. But 
I have no -- social services, human kind of 
wo rk, that kind of stu
ff was understood. In 

those days the interest in wo
rking was for some ag
ency type occupation, not the private 
practice that I do now, or the independent 
practice, where I see independent patients on 
my  own office. And that was 
understood, because lots of fo
lks, and lo ts of community 
positions had that kind of background. And the 
difference was this job was different than 
that job, but that kind of training was simi la
r. And look, my  father
 had been in communal 
kind of involvement for a long
 time, he was very active in 
the chaplaincy. 
Bu mp ed  in to  
social workers all over the place, and all the ve
terans in all the regular hospitals. He was 

the chaplain cy™s chap lain. 
My mother was involved -- grew up in a home that was 
community based. Her father was the rabbi
 of the community. Th
e one rabbi in the 
community of 3000 Jews in Novisad. So th
is was not something that was on Mars. But I 
have no reco llection really. I think my  parent
s were very interested in my finishing 
school. I think they  were very concerned that 
would I finish on what terms, because they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
36
obviously were aware that my high school car
eer was not brilliant. It was not the kind 
that schools were chasing me with schol
arship offers. I me
an, I finished -- 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Emanuel Mandel. This is tape number two, side
 A. Your parents didn™t really pressure 
you in any specific direction 
as you were deciding wh at you 
would do, as you were in 
college. Was there ever any thought that y
ou would move in a -- in a more religious 
direction, that you wo
uld go become a rabbi, or a cantor
? Was there -- did your father -- 
A: That™s a terrific question. 
Q: -- want you to do that? 

A: They did not push me voca
tionally in any direction. They  did push me educationally, 
because they thought it was impor
tant to attain a certain stat
us of having earned a degree, 
that was important. As far as specifically, I th
ink th at they would have been -- my  father 
particularly would have been 
happy if I had been mo re invo
lved in some 
religious life 
avocationally, although I don™t think he
 would have necessarily recommended the 
rabbinate, and don™t misunderstand, and the lis
tener shouldn™t misunderstand, that he had 
some feelin g that that™s a lousy job for a nice Jewish kid, in some ways. It ha -- this -- th-

the politics of the rabbinate is not -- no, the 
rabbinate is not with
out politics, okay? The 
cantor has a different element.
 The cantor requires, at least by his judgment and mine, a 
certain talent wh ich I did not
possess. I was notblessed w
ith a voice, as he and many 
others. He could learn everything. But the 
performance piece requires the talent, and I 
didn™t score well on that. I sang in his choi
r until my voice changed 
kind of, and -- and 
I™m still, at this point, very 
interested in the cantorate, a
nd varying s -- music, and the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
38
only thing I play is the radio. So , no I -- th
-the question is good, 
and th ey would have 
been pleased, but I don™t think 
that he™d -- they  really thou
ght that if I am involved in 
some kind of commu nal service of a Jewish nature
, that™s close, th at™s close, and it was.  
Q: And that was the assumption, th at 
it would be i-in the Jewish community? 
A: I think so , I think so. And it was, in fact
. I don™t know if that was because it was so 
directed, or because I saw no cha -- no choice 
anywhere else, it was not that I didn™t see 
choices anywhere else. If I hadn™t been invo
lved in a scholarship program, in Jewish 
communal service, given by the B™nai Brith, wh ich funded my  graduate school, and then  
I owed th em some time, I would have been 
very interested in go
ing into a different 
element of human services. In 
fact, in the -- in -- as a soci
al worker, yes, but in the 
rehabilitation. In that -- and I did an internship , or an externship at
 the wa -- hospital in 
Philadelphia, and I was very interested in being involved in the 
elements of helping 
people adjust to the dite -- 
activities of daily life, now wi
thout a hand, or now with a 
major disability. Because the poi
nt is you don™t put them into -- onto -- put them on a 
shelf, and make them not partic
ipate. Now, there™s got to 
be some acknowledgement for 
the fact that they may not be
 the same. I mean, blind folks 
are not going to  be pilots, 
rights or no rights. But, that doesn™t mean 
there™s nothing else they can do. And th at 
whole element of that kind of retraining,
 and re-understanding 
of the psychological 
dynamics of being disabled, fascinated me, 
included th e physical elements of it. And I 

would have gone into th at elem
ent of things, as many others th
at I had thought about, if I 
hadn™t had a Jewish commitment.
 And in fact, a guarantee that I have to take a job fo r 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
39
two years, because I have to
 repay them for their having
 given me a scholarship to 
U n iv ersity  o f  P e nn sy lv
ania. So yes, the Jewi sh elemen
t was there, the Jewish vocation 
element sp ecifically, in terms of 
rabbinate or cantor, it was not. 
Q: You said that your parents 
joined a survivor™s group earl
y on, I -- I can™t remember if 
it was in New York , or wh
en they first got -- 
A: Philly. 
Q: In Philly. You must have known ab
out those meetings, did you take -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- take part in them? 
A: Well, not that much. What 
happened is that there is a 
World Federation of Hungarian 
Jury, I think is it™s name, in
 New York . My father knew some of the people there. My 
father knew lots of people, and lots of pla
ces, and he used those contacts for appropriate 
things. And my father tells me again I™m digr
essing on him, but it™s interesting that he 
went to call on a person as a matter of c
ourtesy, not because he was a supporter, but 
because of what he stood, 
what -- what he represented,
 who at that time lived in 
Brooklyn, and was one of the major enemies 
of Israel. This was the Sotmire rabbe from 
Sotmire, Hungary, Rabbi Oyle
 Titlebaum, who my  father kne
w in Sotmire, which is in 
the general area of Ruthinia wh
ere my father was raised. And he called on the rabbe, as 
an acknowledgement of the rabbe™s achievement 
in the ra -- in the rabbe business, as a 
scholar, not as a political entity. But he is th
e leader of the Sotmire Hassidim, and he™s 
not gone, but wh en he went to Israel, they
 changed the ne -- the 
notation on th e trains 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
40
from the state of Israel to cover it up, because 
after all, since this was not created by the 
Messiah, it did not exist. And 
Titlebaum would 
have given Israel to
 Abdullah, and wait 
for the Messiah to come to 
create the state. So, clearly there was no agreement on the 
politics, but my father call on 
-- now why did he call on him? He knew him from there, 
and Titlebaum was with us in 
Bergen-Belsen. He was one of the 1600. So there are many 
people that you tend to know, 
but to get back to -- 
to the issue that™s 
closer to home -- 
Q: Did you participate in those activities? 
A: Right. The World Federation hungar -- of 
Hungarian -- of -- Association of Hungarian 
[indecipherable] was in New Yo
rk , and knew  some people fro
m before. They, my father 
and some others, started an 
organization called the Hungar
ian Hebrew  Association of 
Philadelphia. It was not necessarily of surv
ivors, or a survivor organization, but by 
definition 98 percent of them 
were survivors. And they had 
the fundraisers, and they had 
programs, and th ey had concerts, and th ey 
sponsored Israel bonds, and th ey sponsored 
Jewish National Fund, they spon
sored the forest in Israel, a
nd other kinds of things. So  
this was an element of not a surv ivor orga
nization, but an organization of Hu ngarian 

Jews, who by definition were -- I don™t know ab
out 98 percent, but substantially either 
survivors, or people with su
rvivor families who may have 
come here before the war, so 
they were not survivors, quote unquote, bu
t they were in fact part of the same 
community. And he was very active in that, and I was involved in  -- in my  way, I mean 
the picking up and th e dropping off of pack
ages, the rummage sales. I™m not sure I 
attended too many of the meeti
ngs, I certainly went to their programs. They would get 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
41
together and they would cook potluck dinn
ers, enormous ones for the community, and 
my mother was again involv
ed in the cooki
ng for large numbers, cause she knew 
something about how do you do wh
atever Hu ngarian cooking type
 things for 200, not fo r 
three. And whatever they were, whether it wa
s sour cabbage or some other things, and 
again this was usually done at the synagogue,where my  father had certain privileges. He 
could rent easily enough, and make arrangeme
nts for ma king it available, and he would 
pay a rent, and they  would have programs,
 and that was something they did. My  
involvement in that was limited, but
 clearly I was involved in it. 
Q: Your father then -- and y 
-- both of your parents, their 
professional and social lives 
were very much bou
nd up in the comm
unity, as he -- 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: -- as he wa -- 
as he had wanted. 
A: His, my  mo ther had no professional life 
any mo re, she didn™t have any professional 

life since she -- really sinc
e the time she was married, 
although she had a little bit 
afterwards. She™d been an en
ent -- elementary school teac
her for kiddies in southern 
Hungary, and sh e taught in Temerin, which is 
a city not far from Novisad. I don™t know if 
she taught for three, or four years, maybe
 five, I don™t recall the exact numbers. They 
were married in 1930. My mo
ther was 24 year -- 22 years ol
d, so she couldn™t have 
taught -- well, she tau ght some years after 
that until left Novisad -- maybe four years. 
Q: And was there involvement more to sort of
 be part of that community, and maintain 
the ki -- the welfare of that community, 
or -- how political was it at that time?  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
42
A: In Philadelphia? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Political in the sense of the politics in term
s of American politics, in terms of wa -- the 
republicans and the democrat
s, zilch and zip, none.  
Q: Right. 

A: I would suspect they may have known. I 
certainly could not te
ll you who represented 
me in the state house in Pennsylvania. I re
call vaguely  who th e congressman may have 
been, and the senators, and the mayor, and th
e governor. But only 
vaguely, I mean, I can 
remember. Have to think abou
t the era. The involvement, 
or the household in volvement 
of the organization, and the involvement of my  
parents with these, was at best cursory. I 
don™t remember -- the only place I remember
 going to a political meeting was in New 
Jersey where wif -- my wife is from, we went  to -- he™s of the past, he™s not gone, he 
became a senator, he lost his senatorial pos
ition as part of ABSCAM, Harrison Williams, 
known as Pete Williams, who 
was a congressman from New Je
rs -- was running initially 
in 1950 something or other, and we went to
 a rally in Hillside, 
New Jersey, where my 
wife is from. I -- I™m sure th
at was the first political event I 
went to in my life of that 
kind. But I had no involvement in politics, a
nd neither did my parents, and neither did 
anybody else that I knew, in those days. As I say, I could not tell 
you who represented us 
in Harrisburg, no way. 

Q: So no, like pro-Israel
 kind of involvement? 
A: No, no, but that™s not the 
me -- you™re talking -- I™m ta
lking about American politics. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
43
Q: Right. 
A: The Israel issue is not a political one. That
™s an emotional one. It is alway -- there™s a 
familial -- I mean, we send 
packages, we had communicati
on, we had some visits. I 
mean, I went back to Israel fo
r the first time since I came in 
1957, as did my  parents. We 
went separately, but we met ther
e. I then again went in -- in ™57 -- in ™60, I went, I don™t 
know, half a dozen times, or a dozen times si
nce. But the connection is -- was very clear, 
but it was not a political one. It was not a su
pport of labor, or a 
support of hashomir 
atsyere, or a support later of Leecould. It 
was not a political involvement on their part. I 
would th ink -- since Philadelphia, Pennsylvan
ia had an  open primary system, you could 
vote for any party you wished, I would su spect th
at they registered de
mocrats. I certainly 
was, and I think that had to do with who was,
 in fact, representing. I mean, this was the 
era when Truman had been an important guy,
 and then  came Eisenhower, and then came 
Stevenson as a candidate, and then came Kenne
dy. In that milieu -- Kennedy™s the first 
president I voted for -- in that
 milieu, democratic party seem
ed like the thing I wanted to 
be involved with, because I couldn™t find an
y kind of connection with the republicans, 
though the Philadelphia, th
e -- the -- the -- the governor  of Pennsylvania was a 
republican, and Philadelphia 
had a long, long -- a republic
an mayor, until 50 something 
or other. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s go back to we™r
e about to graduate from college. 
A: Okay . 

Q: And you™ve met your w -- wife-to-be 
-- in college, is that where you met? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
44
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: Nope, nope, nope. Noth
ing to do with college. 
Q: Okay . Did  you graduate then , and -- 
A: Well, I did, but do you wa
nt to go on th e -- on the -- on co
llege, you want to tell -- me 
to tell you about how I met my  wife? 

Q: Well, wha -- how -- tell me ab out your wife. 

A: Then the-there™s no connection there. 

Q: Okay , tell me about how you met your wife. 
A: I became active with some of my buddies in the B™nai 
Brith youth organization, a 
program called AZA, Aleph Zadik Aleph. 
It was a -- you don™t even know about it? 
Q: No, I™m not Jewish. 

A: Well, but I thought you mi
ght have known from these -- 
Q: I™m thinking that -- no -- 

A: -- descriptions. 

Q: -- no, no, I don™t. 
A: You are familiar with the B™nai Brith -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- as an organization? It sponsored a youth
 organization fo r boys, and one for girls. It 
was the largest organization of it™s type in
 the country. I went to work for them, 
eventually, in terms of
 my Jewish commitme n t. She was 
a member of it -- of the girl™s

organization in New Jersey. Philadelphia,  ne
 -- Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia 
and Delaware were in the same district. We
 had conventions, we ha
d get-togethers, we 
had various things. And s -- in Decemb er of 
™53, I think, there was a program of -- a 
weekend program in Ph iladelphia during Chri
stmas break, and the presidents of the 
district honored us with their presence. 
The boy™s president was a young man by the 
name of Eliot Rothman, who was an architect 
in Boston, with whom 
we™re still in close 
contact, and guess who the girl™s presid
ent was? The woman whom you met this 
morning, my wife. And Adrienne
 and Eliot came to give out 
diplomas for this university 
weekend that we had attended. It was not 
university, it was still hi
gh school at the time, 
but there was a program called the university. 
And actually I met her. I met her and many 
others, and we communicated,
 and corresponded, and occas
ionally visited. We had no 
social contact. She went her way, I went my  
way. In 1956, after we™d known each other 
as friends for a couple of years -- as I say 
in those days you didn™t make phone calls 
every day, you -- occasionally a phone call, so
metimes a visit, and some letters -- we met 

up again at the camp in the summertime, we bot
h went there as adults, we were 20, to 
supervise a convention -- well, part of a co
nven tion. And I think 
we had some kind of 
thoughts about each other thr
oughout all this time, but we had never had a date, or a 
connection. I don™t think th at she and I were ev
er alone for an hour at
 the time. With lots 
of other kids, yes. She was involved with so
me kid from college, and I was involved  with 
some girl from someplace else, and we had ac
tive social lives. In ™56 we decided that 
maybe there™s something we ought
 to think about more seriously, and we did. In ™57, we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
46
both went to Europe, separate
ly, and the place where we 
rendezvoused by schedule, was 
in Venice, which is not a plac
e in which to rendezv ous, bot
h socially or romantically. 
And in ™58 we were married. But we met unr
elated to school, she went to Rutgers 
Univ ersity in Newark , I went 
to Temple University in Phila
delphia. Schools had nothing 
to do with our connection at 
any point. And she moved to 
Philadelphia with me while I 
was in graduate school. 
Q: She have survivors in her family? 

A: None.  

Q: No. 
A: Her parents were born here, her grandpare
nts -- her grandparents came from the other 
side, from Europe, three out of the four, but 
they came as young people, befo re the first 
World War. So surv ivors -- she had some aunt
s. But -- and sh e had a cousin, her mother™s 
cousin, Alex. But no, no real 
survivor co nnection. I may have been th e first one that she 
really met. Was a kid in school she talks 
about who arrived at 
her, maybe junior high 
school, who came from Europe, and ev erybody wa
s nice to her, and th ey gave her special 
help, and taught her English 
and things. Bu t limited. You also have to have some 
understanding of the na
ture of the community
. Hillside, New Jersey was kind of an 
enclave outside of Newark, between Newark an
d Elizabeth. Bu t no, I would say that her 
involvement with survivors, ev
en  though sh e may disagree to some degree, was at best 
limited.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
47
Q: And did that cause any diffi
culty between you? Was there 
any bridge to gap? Any gap 
to bridge? 
A: I don™t think the survivor thing has -- wa
s the gap. I think the difference in some 
upbringing, the religious difference -- she 
comes from a  essentia
lly sectarian home, 
Jewish but sectarian, and I didn
™t. I think that the differences
 in where we spent the first 
12 - 15 years of our lives -- I mean, her notion of
 the war was that they
 had air raid alerts 
in school, and th ey craw led under the desk. 
My notion of the same time was air raids. 
There™s a difference. And that difference, I th
ink, has -- had been th ere -- ha -- has been 
there, is there, and will be there. And we™ve 
been together for a very long time. I mean, 
we™re -- 1958 is now what, 47 years ago? 
Q: There™s so many stories you hear about 
people who came to this country , and me-
meeting American Jews, who have no underst
anding of what they ™v e been th ro ugh, and 
how that sometimes caused friction and difficulties. 

A: Oh. 

Q: Was that a problem for you before you me
t your wife, and -- and -- or were there any 
kind of incidents that you rememb er along th
ose lines, about, you know, American Jews 
not understanding what 
you™d been thro ugh? 
A: I don™t think so -- 

Q: Or you th inking th
at they should, or -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
48
A: I don™t think so at the time, because of
 the difference between my self and the adult 
community. I think my parents experienced th
at much more so th
an the kid co mmunity, 
who kind of went with the flow. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, my buddies knew this
, that, and the other thing, and didn™t care about the rest, 
and didn™t -- I didn™t accuse them of not ha
ving been in concentr
ation camp, and they 
didn™t hold me accountable for having been  
there. Not among kids, and I™m talking about 
kids now up to the age of, yo
u know, college age. Adults, so
mething else, their sense of 
establishment when they came,
 what they did, why they  
didn™t help, the whole issue 
about Roosevelt and various emissaries, and 
the interest that th
e national government 
had, and wh at they had to do, and [indecipher
able] the first to rec
ognize that the first 

interest had to be the protection of this count
ry . Bu t that doesn ™t me an they co uldn™t have 
had something to do with other things as we
ll. But there™s a whole 
issue involved with 
who they  were, what they were, wh at thi 
-- their upbringing was. But I™m saying -- the 
question that you ask I think relates with
 my  parent™s generation, not to me. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I can™t recall anything that will be significant
 that I can tell you, where this -- this rub, 
this -- this chafing, as you 
said earlier, was o f issue.  
Q: Mm-hm, for you. Do you know of specif
ic incidents about your parents experience 
along those lines? I 
mean, was there -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
49
A: No. No, well, specific, no. I th
ink th at there were issues havi
ng to do with the fact that 
anybody who didn™t come he
re on the Mayflower, and nobody I knew came on the 
Mayflower, was seen as -- the reference be
ing a greener, a newcomer. And that came up 
once in awhile. Certainly my  father had that be
cause the kind of life that he had to start 
all over with for the third time, was not the ki
nd of life that he had in th-the first time. 
And in some ways he resented that, and to so
me degree he expected things of people in 
terms of performance, in term
s of responsib ility, that he 
thought was appropriate to 
expect.  
Q: I don™t -- can you be mo re specific about 
what you mean? He expected wh at kinds of 
things from people? 

A: He expected -- well, you have to know 
something about him as well, which I™m not 
going to  detail for you, but the point is he ex
pected certain behavior norms, and cert -- if 
somebody said I™m going to do th
is, he should do it, not forget
 it. This has nothing to do 
with being an immigrant, but it has to do with
 the fact that when 
he was in Europe, and 
was the chief cantor of Budapest
, essentially if he barked, so
mebody said yes. And here 
he was not that, but the expectation may have
 been the same. If some of his colleagues 
said they will do this or that, or the other 
thing, and bring this piece of music to that 
rehearsal, he expected that. And if they
 didn™t, it had something to  do with him 
personally, but also with  the fact that he di
d not -- he did not suffer fools well, cause he 
never had to . I think that he had so me feeli
ngs about the fact that when  he was looking 
for a position in  Ph iladelphia, he
 had occasions to go to vari
ous places, and to essentially 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
50
go fo r tryouts. And he was resentful of the fact
, for example, that one
 rabbi said to him -- 
rabbi came from the same neigh
borhood that he did in  Europe, but came 20 years before, 
he said to him, ﬁWell, yo
u know, cantor, in th
is congregation, the cantor does the 
responsiv e readings in English.ﬂ To wh ich my
 father said, you know, I mean, ﬁIs that 
what you want me to do? I mean, you have
 now just said the weakest part of my 
arma ment is what you want me to feature.
 I mean, I can speak English, I can read 
English, but I have reasonably difficult accent,
 and this is not my -- I mean, I™ll do it in 
German, I™ll do it in Hebrew, I™ll do it in Russia
n, but I won™t do it in English, because 
again, it™ll embarrass me, and it™ll embarrass yo
u.ﬂ ﬁWell, if you can™t do that, we can™t 
give you the job.ﬂ An d he thought that there 
was an element of saying, uh-uh, I made it, 
you ain™t. And that was a resent thing agai
nst the newcomer. It may have also been a 
resentment against my father™s skills and 
abilities, which may have been threatening to 
some others. And he was an outstanding cant
or, and if that sounds like a chauvinistic 
statement, it isn™t, alright? An enormous vo
ice, was very well trained, and it scared the 
hell out of folks who weren™t. You know? 
Who were legends only 
in their own minds, 
and he was not, but [inaudible]. So there ar
e things like that. We came from central 
Europe. The majority of the Je
wish community in 
this country came from eastern Europe. 
My mo ther was not Yiddish  speaking. I don™t
 know if you know, but Yiddish was not 
spoken ev erywhere in Europe. My grandfat
her knew Yiddish  very well. My father knew 
Yiddish very  well, because when  they went to
 Yeshiva, which is th
e original schooling 
thing, you learned in Yiddish
, you learned -- you 
learned Bible, wh
ich is written in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
51
Hebrew, discussing it in Yiddish, not in He
brew, because you didn™t use the Hebrew 
language for secular conversation. It™s a 
holy language, it™s only 
fo r study. And you 
discussed it in Yiddish. So th
ey  knew Yiddish, they spoke Yiddish  at home. Much of the 
community that you see here, that came fro
m Poland and Russia had Yiddish in th eir 
homes. In New York my 
mother was told any number -- sh
e wasn™t told, it was told about 
her that she doesn™t even speak a proper language. How can the cantor™s wife not speak a 

proper language? Wh at™s the proper language? 
Yiddish . So those were things that they 

had to do with the fact that
 she didn™t speak a proper la
nguage, she didn™t come from the 
right place, and she didn™t come when we came
. These kinds of things. Are they serious? 
No. Are they significant? Somewhat. Impact? 
Some. Critical? No. That™s the valuation I 
can give you about the impact
 of t h e Jewish community. 

Q: You finished school, you had this two 
year commitment, and what -- where did you 
go, what -- what kind of work di
d you do when  you finished school? 
A: I had a choice to -- well, I had to take
 a position with the B™nai Brith  youth 
organization as a professional member of the staff. Okay? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I had a choice -- if not a choice, a 55
 - 45 choice, so it was not a total choice, but 
a choice still, of taking a position in the Ph iladelphia office, or taking a position in the 
Cleveland office. I went to Cleveland. I really 
thought that I wanted to have a career start 
not in my  hometown , for all the blessings of
 the hometown, and all the negatives of the 
hometown. I went to Cleveland for two year
s. While in Cleveland, a position opened up 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
52
in Detroit, which is no more 
attractive than Cleveland, but it was in a different district, 
with a different staff, with a different superv
isor, with a different boss than Chicago, and 
it would -- and it was the top job in  the state of
 Michigan, and I was in
terested  in that, to 
see if I could do that. And I got that job, an
d as a consequence, I stayed well beyond my 
two year commitment, and I st
ayed with them for 15 years.
 And I was with the agency 
totally for 15 years, Clevel
and and Michig an -- well, even
 before, I was even in New 
Jersey for a little time. But I 
stayed with the B™nai Brith 
organization as a professional 
social worker. They us
ed to hire group wo rkers in those days, wh ich I was, and I ran a 
program for healthy, well-adju
sted middle class Jewish kids
 in the state 
of Michigan. 
Q: What kind of program? 
A: It™s a social, educational, religious, athle
tic program after school. They  meet in groups 
called chapters, very much like 
I was involved as a kid in a 
chapter in Philadelphia, my 
wife in a chapter in New Jersey. And we w
ould have gatherings, and -- where we met, 

and others met, and I 
had not the same, but similar prog
rams, in Michigan
, and programs 
in the district, which was the larger area 
of the Midwest, and programs which were 

national, which was in the national encampmen
t, which happens to be in Pennsylvania. 
You know, it™s a home turf for me 
again, but that™s a -- it coul
d have been in -- went to 
conventions the University of Illinois, where we in f
act, took the university at 
Champagne, for a convention of several hundre
d kids from that district. That was a large 
program divided throughout the co
untry in to seven different di
stricts, and the details of 
that are not important. No longer that. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
53
Q: And you™re -- you were 
married by that time? 
A: We were married -- yeah sure, we were 
married ™58, went to -- I was married all 
through graduate school. My da
ughter was born in ™60, we 
went to Cleveland in ™61, 
went to Detroit in ™63, came here in ™73 -- 
Q: Oh, so that™s [indecipherable] 
A: -- to Washington, right. With the same orga
nization to be the third man in the national 
office, which was terrific in terms of my
 having co me to Washington, I™ve never 
regretted that. But after three years here, or 
two years, the national office, for many, many 
reasons I thought that™s not wh at I want to do.
 Continue in there sometimes needs to be a 
-- not so mu ch a vocational chan ge, but mayb
e an employment change
. And we came to a 
mu tual meeting of separation. 
Q: And you became a private -- 
A: Nots -- not quite -- 
Q: No. 

A: -- I went to work for the -- I mean, the largest employer in th
is community is the 
federal government. I went to work at a pr
ivate agency in southeast Washington fo r two 
years with a friend of mine, which was tota
lly funded by government contract, and that 
kind of petered out because of
 a number of things that happe
ned, including a change in 
administration. I went to work for the Peace Co
rps, here in town, as a trainer, particularly 
in areas of psychological kinds of issues, and 
counseling kinds of services to be given -- 
this is only to the staff of 
the Peace Corps, I never had anything with volunteers, but they  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
54
would work  with volunteers. 
I™d -- rec -recognition of cultu
ral difference, I mean you 
have a Peace Corps vol -- Peace
 Corps staff member is going 
to be the agricultural staff 
member in west Africa. He 
knows the agricultural business, but if you ask him about 
cultural differences, you have to  first define
 the word  culture, cause he never seen 
anything, besides Montana. Whatever, I™m 
not maligning Montan a.
 Culture in this 
country, I mean reme mb er, this is a country
 where you can go for 
3,000 miles with one 
language, with great success. You can not do 
that anywhere in the world. You can™t do it 
India, China, or Russia, which are the same 
size. You can do it in Australia, but for most 

of it there™s no people, so [indeciph
erable] talk with so me kangaroo. 
Q: Sheep, too. 
A: Sheep. So, it™s not a fair [indecipherable] to
 go from Perth to Kearns is probably same 
distance as it is from Boston, San Francisco, 
but there™re no people there to talk to. And 
English, obviously, will get you by. Their ve
rsion of it anyhow. So, those cultural things, 
and other kinds of co unseling things, and other -- understandi
ng of certain kind of -- 
psychological kind of issues that
 might be difficult, was what
 I did for the Peace Corps, 
and actually not just for the Peace Corps, but at the time, the ad
minist -- president™s 
administration thought that they
 ought to put the 
Peace Corps together with the domestic 
Peace Corps called Vista. 

Q: Right. 
A: In an agency called Action, which never wo
rked  that well, but it did, so I was involved 
in both. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
55
Q: Let me stop here while -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- while -- so we don™t run -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Emanuel Mandel. This is tape number two, 
side B. Did I just lose my microphone? 
A: You lost your microphone. So, all I™m sa
ying is that I was in
volved in both the 
domestic element of action, which was Vista,
 and the overseas element of action called 
Peace Corps. But I never served overseas, I 
n ever served [indecipherable] I was with 
them for eight years. After th
at I began to develop a priv
ate psychotherapy program, and 
practice, and I have done that in a couple of 
different locations for th
e last, gee, 20 years. 
Q: What kind of issues do yo
u deal with [indecipherable] 
A: Deal with adolescents and adults in i
ssues that are -- many of them are similar no 
matter what age you are in. Depression is de
pression at any ag e, almost. The separation 
issues for younger people are the same no ma
tter where you are, ma ny of them having to  
do with the need to strike so
me kind of understanding and 
insight that an outsider can 
strike, that the insider cannot.
 Example, family comes to see me  with a kid who is a high 
school senior, and th is is Ma
rch of any year. And the kid e
ssentially has, in fact, run 
away, or left, come back after three or four 
days, because he feels that he no longer can 
function with the confines and th e restrictionsof the parental home. It™s devastating for a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
56
family to have this happen. If you can help
 the parents make some  adjustment, the kid 
make some  adjustment, gain some insight, an
d postpone that runa
way for four months. 
Four months. Now, the kid is 
going to go away to school. 
That™s a legitimate ru naway. 
It™s a runaway in either case, if you nee -- 
know wh at I™m saying. But in th e one is 
legitimate andnot devastating 
to the family, and one is. An
d sometimes the outsider can 
make that happen and observe th at and under
stand it, cause I™m not emotionally involved 
with the kid nor the parents. And the parents,
 what they™ll do is they™ll do ev ery kind of 
tough love issue there is, and th
ey™ll restrict, and restrict, and 
the kid will rebel, and rebel. 
And the more you push, the more th -- you re
sist. Well, if you can
 understand that, and 
the dynamics of that, you can be very helpfu l. And once in awhile I am. 

Q: It™s been a very interesti
ng kind of gradual move for you 
in that direction, to working 
with people individually in th
eir very intimate, kind of family
 problems. It™s not -- i-it™s 
not -- i-it was an evolution for you. 

A: Sure. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t think I could have said to yo
u 35 years ago I™m gonna do that, because the 
number of folks in my  field 
who were doing that, 
you could count on one hand, and I™m 
exaggerating again. It was the province of th
e psychiatrist, who had 
limited med ication to 
prescribe, because there weren™t any. I me
an, anybody could prescribe medication, many 
psychiatrists could, and the medication of
 choice 50 years ago was various kinds of 
tranquilizers. If you tranquilize th
em enough, all mental p atient
s will be docile, and th ey 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
57
could be put in institutions, an
d even into back wa
rds, which no longer exist. The world 
h a s b eco me mu ch  mo re co mp lex  
than it was as recently as 
50 years ago. A hundred years 
ago I can™t talk about. But 
in the last 50 years compli -- complexities have evolved 
geometrically. As a consequence, the kind
 of help that™s psychotherapeutically 
appropriate had to 
evolve into more practitioners. Psycho
logists began to do some of that, 
those who became clinical psyc
hologists, not research guys. And today social workers 
provide more of that than any other professi
on by the numb er of hours provided  in this 
community. Now, I didn™t think of doing that beca
use I on -- first of all, that w as not part 
of my  thinking, secondly, I didn™t think that
 I could -- this may have some to do with 
what I did as a kid, I didn™t think that I coul
d take the risk of economically subjecting my 

family to a -- to a horserace while my kids we
re still in school. I didn™t start this until 
after they were out of school. I figured  the wo
rst can happen, we™ll skip a meal. My wife 
and I will make it. And thirdly, I really thou
ght that one cannot do this, no matter what 
training they have, until they have practiced
 in a variety of ways. I™ve always had 

individual attention to things. I mean, I re
me mb er wh en  li
censure became mandatory in 
the state of Maryland in 1970 - something or
 other. And obviously I was well off that I 
was -- I was out of school 15 years. And I had 
to put together the pieces of hours that I 
provided  an  individual psychotherapy, or in di
vidual counseling in th e previous 15 years, 
an hour here, two hours there, three hours 
there, because I wasn™t doing th is 40 hours a 
week. You had to co me up with  some 2,0
00 hours or something, and I don™t recall 
exactly how, but I think, you 
know, a percen tage of every year was spent in this, in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
58
families. I mean, I had to, in 
my  job in  Michig an, I had to get a kid out of jail once in 
awhile, and I had to have a su
icide attemp t, and I had to  have a runaway, and I had to 
have a something else. I mean, again, these th
ings add up, but I did this on a very limited 
basis, and then of course it 
became something I did full time.
 But I didn™t think I could it 
full time, u n til I had amassed the body of expe
rience. So you talked 
before about gapping 
bridges, or bridging gaps, I ha
d to have bridges to things. An
d you don™t have a bridge to 
various things until you™ve had so
me experience, not so much 
in life, but life and applied 
practice.  
Q: I™m leap ing ahead to the 
big kind of question, but -- 
A: You™re gonna bridge th
e gap, or gap the bridge? 
Q: I™m alw ays trying to do that. What is it 
about your experience, your -- a fact of your 
being a survivor? What does that -- what -- 
what -- from that expe
rience, what do you 
bring to what you do with pe
ople in -- in this setting? 
A: You™d be so -- you™d be so easy, and I -- a
nd I have to  tell you, I™ve thought about this 

a great deal, specifically because of this interv
iew. It™d be so easy to say, well obviously  I 
saw atrocities, I saw terrible things, I saw thi
ngs that shouldn™t happen
 to humans, and the 
job that I now have helps humans, therefore 
-- that™s too glib, and too easy, and it™s not 

true. Now, does that impact? Of course. But I 
think the impact is an on -- is on -- on the -- 
on th e understanding of behavior, of mo tivati
on, of choices, of why do people sometimes 
go like sheep, and sometimes don™t go like shee
p, and it™s the same people in different 
settings? I can™t tell you th e answ er to that, but
 those kinds of behaviors does in some

way have some additional armament, or some
 additional bridge to human behavior. But 
as I say, I cannot say, nor will I say to you 
that because, therefore -- it™s an obvious. I saw 
bad, I can do good, that™s a good thing. That™s glib.  
Q: But you were in a position 
as a child to perhaps focu s on cause and effect of people™s 
behaviors because there was -- you were in some danger -- 
A: Oh, absolutely. 
Q: -- and you knew that, so
 you were -- you were -- 
A: Well, I don™t know how I knew it, I don™t know -- 

Q: Well, you -- you said befo re, in the other 
interview, that maybe 
you didn™t understand 
the larger situation, but yo
u know when  there™s a man there with a gun, and th ere™s 
barbed wire -- 

A: Right, right, right. 
Q: -- and there™s a turret, th
at this is not a normal -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- that I™m under some kind of danger here. 

A: Okay, no, I was -- I was prob
ably in more danger specif
ically in Israel when the 
independence war was going on, and shots were fi
red and some hit my 
house. It didn™t hit 
me, because I wasn™t stupid enough to be standi
ng out there, but I™m sa
ying that that kind 
of danger is a little different, but you™re right.  
Q: Right. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072

A: I think th at I have a capacity to obser
ve, sharpened by 40 years of practice, by 
education, or by the eyesight that I was born 
with. I think I have an 
ability to in some way 
amalgamate various kinds of b
ackground pieces, and put it toge
ther into an approach, so 
that they become part of that. But I have 
to say again th at maybe it™s because I was not 
old enough to understand, and 
maybe I would have understood at 15, the fact that I™m 
undamaged by it, at least substantially so, I 
recall, I understand, I can re-retell, I und -- I 
know wh at went on, and of course I understo
od the meaning of it subsequently , but I was 
not damaged the same way. A siren doesn™t fri
ghten me, okay? And a siren is an example 
that™s given by many survivors, they hear 
a siren today, ambulance, and they  freeze on 
some level, to some degree. A siren does no
t frighten me. And again, a siren here is only 
a smallest of examples, because the sirens were very dangerous, because we were 

bombed in Budapest. We spent days in the bu
nker, in -- not the bunk
er, in the cellar, and 
in the -- in the -- in the she
lter. No, not days, we spent part
s of days, sometimes four and 
five times a night. My grandmother, my fath
er™s mother who was liv
ing with us at the 
time, went back to her little 
villag e, from which she was depo
rted, because the elevator -- 
and I said this on th e other tape -- the elevat
or was invariably out of commission, cause 
they couldn™t get parts to repair them, and to 
go down  five stories, three and four times a 

night, was too mu ch  for her to do. Choice two was send her back where she didn™t have 

to go to the air raid she
lter. And she was deported. Ah, 
she would have been deported 
perhaps, elsewhere as well. But I™m saying it™
s because I under -- because I recalled, and 
can now, and have fo r some ti
me been able to  assimilate 
that. But I wasn™t -- you know, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
61
if you looked at my  guts, they don™t have bl
ack and blue marks, they™re clear. Or my 
brain doesn™t have it. 
Q: Mm-hm. What about your parents? Yo
ur father lived to -- into his 90™s. 
A: He was -- he would have been  90 in  mar --
 he would have been 
90 in  March, he died  
in January  of the same  year, it™s close enough. 

Q: Oh, uh-huh, yeah . So you 
-- you knew them for quite a -- your mo ther died quite 
young, I think -- 
A: My mother died 
at the age of 59 -- 
Q: My goodness. 
A: -- for entirely different reasons, and I don
™t think th e Holo caust connected. One day 
they thought she had a stroke, cause she was dr agging a leg. Literally days after the war 
in Israel in 1967, they
 went to Israel to visit family, 
after the six day war. And they came 
back in August, I know 
I picked them up, I was in the eas
t, I was living in Michigan, and 
my mother was not well. Well, this is in 
August, by Decemb er they discovered she had a 
massive growth in her 
head, and that killed her. I mean, they radiate it, but in those days 
this was a caveman oncology. I mean, this wa
s the kind of thing that today two pills, and 
something would cure it. And I don
™t mean that literally, but -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- it™s -- we have gone thousands of m
iles beyond that. She -- this killed her. There 
was a choice of operating or radiating. And we
 were told that operating would invariably  
-- invariably produce a vegetable. My father a
nd I agreed that that™s
 of no valu e if she 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
62
lives to be a hundred , in a bed as a vegeta
ble. We radiated, it metastasized, she died, 
1967. So  the impact of my  parents was signifi
cant, and in my fathe
r™s case lengthy, but 
very different in my mother™s. 
You remember that I was with 
my mother all of my life. I 
mean, I left both of them 1958 - ™59. As a matter
 of fact, interestingly,
 we even lived with 
my  parents for a very short time. When  I 
was looking fo r graduate school, one was in 
Pennsylvania, one was in New Jersey, one was 
in New York. And I couldn™t find a rental 
for my wife and I for three months, or maybe 
four months, for a very short time, I -- in 
those days, Philadelphia did not offer very sh
ort rentals, and I guess a hotel was not an 
idea. So we moved to my  parent™s house unt
il the decision was ma de wh ere I would goi -
- go to school. And when it was made that 
I™m going to be in 
Philly, we took an 
apartment immediately , which was our first ap
artment, which was very
 nice. But we lived 
with them. But it was with my 
mo ther thro ughout. When  I was born, in Riga, two months 
after I was, my father went to Budapest to be
gin his rehearsals for th
e holidays in the fall. 
My mo ther then pack ed  up, and two uncles ca
me out and helped  her, and we trucked to 
Budapest. My father was away
 from the house for continuous times in labor camp s. We 
were at home. We went to Bergen-Belsen, 
he was not with us. He comes after us to 
Palestine -- to Israel, h e leaves before us. So
 my father™s relationshi
p with me as a child 
up to  the age of 15 or so, is very spotty , a
nd I am sure it had im
pact. I can™t tell you 
precisely, but he wasn™t there, through no 
-- and I never held him accountable for not 
being there. The fact that he was in his ow
n field, meant that he never played baseball 
with me, but you can overcome that. But he wa
s not there, through no fault of his own. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
63
His influence was there, his impact was there,
 his feelin gs were there. Excuse me. I™m 
going to  back up for a teeny story about lan
guage. You asked ab out English. My  mo ther 
and my father correspond when he is here, a
nd my mother and I are still in Haifa, and 
there were some times during the War of I
ndependence in Israel where food was scarce. 
Plentiful, but some things were scarce. We 
had all the dairy and all the veg -- butter was 
rationed, you know? You could li
ve without that. But all the br
ead, and all the vegetables, 
and some meat, and all the fish
 from Australia was available.
 But my mother says that 
things are scarce. My father ge
ts absolutely frighten
ed, and goes to the post office, and I 
reme mb er to this day, he p
acks up a package from 
the grocery store, and ship s it by air to 
Israel, 44 dollars. It w as probably a week™s sala
ry in those days, 1947.
 Ships this thing to 
Israel. And we open up, and we see these lit
tle cans, little flat cans, and it says on it, 
Chicken of the Sea. Well me, wi
th my incredible knowledge of
 English, decided this is 
chicken. It™s a very funny, oily chicken that
 these Americans put in cans. Cans were not 
unusual to us, but what kind 
of chicken is this, and how 
do you co ok it? I cannot tell you 
what my  mo ther did with this, I don™t rememb
er. But this was my  knowledge of English, 
Chicken of the Sea was chicken, right? Well, 
we both know th at™s
 not exactly what it 
means. My mother™s English 
was even less than mine. She 
didn™t even k
now the word 
chicken. Bu t we had this neat me al. As you 
know, kosher requires no mixing of the two. 
We had th is very strange American chicken. It
 didn™t taste like chicken, it was in oil. But 
it said chicken, and Mandel the English expert said --  
Q: Mom -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
64
A: Mom, it™s chicken. Cause he knows. An
d they also had corn
 flakes that were 
introduced, and we didn™t know how th e hell 
do you butter corn flakes
, like bread or that 
kind of thing. Bu t again, I -- I couldn™t read 
the English, I mean I could underst -- I didn™t 
-- I might have known the word corn. I am
 certain I didn™t know
 the word flakes. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right? 
Q: Right. 

A: And I knew the word chicken, I knew th
e word  sea, but I never could connect -- 
course I™m not sure I ever 
had tuna fish in my life. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean, why would I? And if I did, it wa
s a filet of tuna, or a stew of tuna, or 
something th at my  mo ther could recognize as a fish. 
Q: Right. 
A: The thing in the can doesn™t
 look like a fish. English. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But I was with my mother 
-- I sometimes illustrate it by 
saying that I always spoke 
with my father in the langua
ge of the land in which we 
lived. Hungarian in Hungary, 
Hebrew in Israel, English here. With my 
mother, Hungarian always. Not because she 
didn™t know any English, but with  my  mo
ther it was always Hungarian, no matter where 
we lived. There™s a different continuity with
 her than was with him. So I missed his 
involvement, which was spotty, and clearly th
rough no effort on his 
part to do that. I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
65
suppose in some ways he coul
d have been more of a dad 
only, but only in terms of 
throwing a ball right handed. That™s silline
ss. Every other way he was. And I had the 
mo st consistent part of his life with me when
 I no longer needed it. 
When  I wanted it, but 
didn™t need it. I mean, I was 
an adult, with two children, 
living in Michigan. That™s -- it 
was in those days that I had full availability of
 my father, and none of my mother. So that 
my  parent™s influence on me had these kind
s of impacts, both good and both -- I have 
both bad. They both survived , but I did not sp
end equal time and equal impact for both of 
them. 

Q: Right. Did you and your mo ther talk
 about the day -- about the war, and your 
experience together in Be
rgen-Belsen very much? 
A: Not much, because we lived it together. 

Q: You didn™t need 
to talk about it. 
A: No. In  my family, conversa
tions about this took place willy
-nilly and at the drop of a 
hat. But nobody had to be told. I mean, my fa
ther had to be told about where we were, 
and we had to be told ab out wh ere he was. 
And that we did. Bu t it wasn™t a question of 
my mother and I talking about where we were
, because we were there every day. I saw 
her every day, there was not a day I didn™t s
ee her. You recall that when  we went out of 
se -- out of Germany by German troop train, 
in Switzerland, who is the teacher that is 
accompanying this group of 20
 kids? My mother. Which wa
s good and bad, but again 
even then, I was not separated from her. I 
digress, but for historical reasons it™s 
significant. In some communication ab out 
the Custner group, I got a letter from a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
66
professor at Michigan State 
University in Lansing, Mich
ig an. I won™t mention a name 
because I™m not sure he wants to be named. 
And the name rings a bell, and I write him a 
note, and I said, ﬁAre you, by any chance, th
at kid,ﬂ -- and I send him a picture that I 
have, ﬁwith whom I was in Switzerland?ﬂ And he
 says yes. Okay ? And then  he sends me 
-- we have been in to uch -- he sends me a Xe
rox of a postcard, written to his mo ther by 
my mother, saying that the boy is having so me
 difficulties. He™s fine, but he™s not with 
his mother -- I was -- and he starts having so
me difficulties, but he™ll be alright, and she 
ask when is she going to come visit, what
ever. My mother™s handwriting, 1945. And I 
have that. And he sends it to me. So I™m sayi
ng that my mother™s in
fluence again was -- I 
had a couple of beatings really, really bea
tings, because a couple of kids walked off 

campus, and they were caught, an
d they were certain that I ra
tted, cause I™m the teacher™s 
kid. And I didn™t. I™m -- I really -- I wouldn™t
 dare. I mean, of -- I -- it™s -- it™s against the 
rules. In any case I™m saying my
 mo ther and I had this kind 
of a connection. I probably  
lo ok  lik e my  mo th er, mu ch  mo re
 than my father then, and th roughout my life, although 
now people say to me, look at 
my eyes. My father had a very different kind of a face, but 
I look like my mother, 
my mother™s family. I 
was much closer to my
 mother™s family. I 
spent time with my 
mother™s parents. My mother™s sist
ers, my mo ther™s brothers. I only 
spent time with my father™s one
 brother, who went to Israel and died since. And here, 
with my aunt in Philadelphia. But I was 
much more connected, so with her, these 
discussions were unnecessary. I h ave a frien
d of mine here who -- ag ain I won™t name, 
who talks about he doesn™t have to learn abou
t the civil rights strugg
le, of which he was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
67
both a victim and a winner, he ju st has to reme
mb er it. Cause he was a law student in the 
basement, and a dumbwaiter would bring down th
e lessons at the Univ ersity of Arkansas, 
many years ago, and I won™t give the names. Bu
t he doesn ™t have to -- to study it, he just 
has to remember it. W ell, in a same sense,
 I don™t have to study elements of the 
Holocaust that I lived through, I just have to remember it. My mother and I could 
remember. When she went
 to [indecipherable] and she bou
ght a -- there™s a watch that I 
wear that she bought in [indec
ipherable] because in those days there was some  thought 
that if you have a watch or two -- you coul
d always trade a watch for a meal, a good 
Swiss watch. And then she gave it to me late
r on, and it™s my watch for 50 years, lo -- 
more, more. But we can re
member those things.  
Q: What about when  you ha 
-- when your kids got old enough? You -- there -- so often 
you hear these difficult storie
s ab out survivors telling their children, or not telling their 
children wh at they went through. Since you
r experience was not such  a traumatic one, 
you didn™t have that inhibition,
 I would think. So many survivors say I don™t want to -- I 
don™t want to tell my kids because it was so 
horrible, and -- and they don™t need to know 
that. But wh at was your experience with yo
ur kids? How did you te
ll your kids, when did 
it come out? 
A: The difference in my trauma and others 
was the fact th at mine was a much shorter 
duration.  
Q: Right. 
A: And I did not understand it. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
68
Q: Right. 
A: I wouldn™t want to -- I wouldn™t want to
 weight levels of trauma. However, from day 
one, whatever that is, I was 
willing to, I thought that it™s important to know, you can™t 
know wh ere you™re going if
 you don™t know where you 
came from. Maybe a cliché. 
George Santayana™s comment about the fact that
 if you don™t learn history well, you learn 
to -- you have to repeat it or relive it is a
nother one, there are many 
of those. And I have 
involved my kids in 
either visiting with me, speaking w
ith me, going to the museum with 
me, co min g  to  p r og rams with  me
, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
, any wh ich way I can, and I 
think they are quite conversant. I did not belie
ve that since it™s traumatic for me , I should 
not give them the opportunity to  learn. That
™s unfair. It™s denying them experience that 
they should -- they can reject it,
 th ey can ignore it, but they ha
ve the right to possess it. It 
is exactly what I said in the beginning of th
is conversation about archiving this material. I 
think that many of the people that are record
ed -- I mean, that have
 been, thousands and 
thousands, may not be interes
ting, and may be repetitions of 
some other folks, but if it 
isn™t archived, it can never be retrieved. And 
I wanted to archive it in my  kids, and my  
grandkids. 
Q: Mm-hm, and how did they receive it? It
 -- is it -- is it 
som -- do they ask you 
questions, do th ey -- 
A: In many ways, well sure. But it™s become
 -- it is not a -- you know, a holy writ of 
some sort that needs to be ap
proached gingerly and tenderly
, like, I sh -- don™t want to 
upset you too much. It was this year or la -- 
it was last year I think, there was a book 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
69
written about the experience of Custner, not 
the Robert Saint John
 book, but by Alex 
Brand. Alex Brand was the partner or colleag
ue of Custner, who in fact was sen t under 
German supervision to go talk 
to the allies about th
e original transfer of people versus 
trucks. It™s not on th is 
tape, but it™s in the history. He wa
s arrested in Syria, in Aleppo, 
and jailed in Cairo fo r the rest of the war. He writes a book after the war called, 
ﬁDesperate Journey.ﬂ So me years -- many ye
ars ago, a friend of mine who has since 
gone, asked if I had the book. I said, ﬁNo, 
but I™d like to reread
 it.ﬂ And I borro wed it 
from him, and I gave it back to him. Later 
on I ask him for the book again, he said, ﬁI 
can™t find it.ﬂ So I did someth
ing which is illegal, but not 
immoral, and not fattening. I 
had occasion when I was with the Peace Co rps to have the book borrowed from the 
Library of Congress on interagency loan, an
d I Xeroxed it. That™s illegal, but not 
immoral, andnot fattening. 
Q: As long as you didn™t sell it. 
A: I -- well it™s -- Xero xing it is illegal, but it™
s out of print. And I gave a copy to my  -- 
each of my kids, and I have one in the house. 
Couple of years ago -- last year I remember, 
my daughter gets me a present for my birthda
y. She got it on the in
ternet, she found two 
copies of the book, bought them both, one 
for her, one for me. I now have the book on 
the shelf, right next to Robert
 Saint Johns slightly fictiona
lized version. My  point being 
that she thinks about these th
ings. She had this idea, maybe 
on the internet with whatever, 
Amazon, oh I don™t know where, she was able 
to find the book, and there were three, I 
think, that were available, she didn™t need
 three, she got two. My  son calls me  up th e 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
70
other day and talks about La 
Spaitsia, cause he saw some pictures with surfing. Now 
these are all Holocaust connect
ed, history connected to our family, that we were quite 
free to share, and to -- and to 
talk about, and to 
inform, and to update 
constantly. When i 
did the Spielberg interview, my 
kids were here. [phone ringing] 
Q: Here we go. Okay, we™re recording again. 
A: All I was saying is that these are normal activities of daily life th
at happen without any 
specific reason, it just happens, and we do it, 
and my  kids are very mu ch involved with it. 
My grandchildren, well, my  son™
s daughter is five, let™s wait.
 My daughter™s daughter is 
10, and she knows a little bit, and the son is 14
, and he knows a lot. And again, there are 
these conversations. One of the things I did for 
my  grandson, the 14 year old, as part of 
my -- interestingly for a Bar M
itzvah gift, or right of passage
, I took him to the Holo caust 
Museum. I thought at 13, or 14, he was old en ough to do that. And he -- I™m not going to 
say that he enjoyed it, but you 
know, he at least was exposed 
to it. Clearly, my  taking him 
is an indication of my willingness, and his 
willingness to have the tw o of us have that 
experience together. I was sayi
ng before on the tape that 
when the Spielberg interview 
took place in the house, 
they asked the family be there at the end and th
ey photographed 
the whole family, and my  kids all came. And 
it™s quite an open door i
ssue in this family. 
It is not in many others, for many reasons. I 
don™t happen to believe that protecting my  
kids of the reality of my past is
 a good thing to do, so I don™t. 
Q: 20 years ago or so, when  the Ho locaust 
sort of became such a public issue in the 
United States, it was in th
e 70™s, I think when -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
71
A: Early 80™s. 
Q: And after this -- 
A: The first world gathering of th e 
Holocaust survivor
s in Jerusalem.  
Q: Yeah. And there was this documentary on
 ABC about the Holocaust, a miniseries. 
A: With Meryl Streep? 

Q: Was that it? I 
can™t remember -- 
A: That™s one. 
Q: -- who was in it, but it sounds to me t
hough, like it wasn™t a time when the Holocaust 
sort of came out of the closet, in a sense, 
for you, because it -- it 
was never a -- an issue 
that wasn™t discussed. But y -- among your 
friends and colleagues, 
did people that you 
knew suddenly say oh, tell me your
 story, or how did that awak
ening, if you will, affect 
you? 
A: As I think back, it didn™t. 
Then. My awakening, if you w
ill, came a little bit later, in 
that I said to my self, wait a minute. We™re 
running out of people, 
we™re running out of 
time. I better be more active 
than I™ve been. Oh, I 
had been involved  and I was glad to 
speak here, or speak there. You know, I -- my
 background includes having been  thro ugh 
elements of the Holocaust, and 
different stories my father ha
d, and then being in Israel 
afterwards, and being there durin g the War 
of Independen ce, and having been  -- you 
know, I™ve -- I™ve a number of pieces, and that 
has been used in talk
s, in -- in -- in 
gatherings, in tell me your story, I™ve never 
been to Riga, whatever
. But nothing that was 
either concentrated, or directed. It was kind 
of ad hoc, and here, there, whatever. I think 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
72
that the focus came not out of
 the awakening of the -- bo
th the documentary or the 
miniseries Holo caust, and then  The Shoah, 
which was the Polish filmmakers movie of 
many, many, many hours. Or li -- it came a little
 bit later to me, and I don™t know exactly 
why. Not that I wasn™t -- it was n o t denial, it wa
s just that I didn™t wake up. I can honestly 
say to you that at that Spie
lberg Academy Awards thing, was 
the thing th at kind of woke 
me up mo st specifically. To say you gotta do
 mo re, you gotta do, y
ou gotta involve, you 
gotta involve yourself. Use whatever you ca
n about connecting pieces, mo re than you 
have before.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Emanuel Mandel. This is tape number three,
 side A. It was -- you were saying it was -- 
A: It was not an issue of denial, it was an 
issue of inactivity in be
ing involved, and since 
we™re here I™m going to enter another little --
 not a commercial, just
 for the -- for the -- 
for history, and fo r legacy. 
Nobody in this world ever, 
ever calls me Emanuel.  
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: Just informationally. If they do, that 
means only one thing. They never met me.  
Q: That™s okay. 
A: I don™t mean you necessarily -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but you™re on th e tape, but Emanuel is th
e way the phone book is
 li sted, so people

Q: Oh, okay.  

A: So th ey gave up. 
Q: Okay . I have a couple of other questions that are -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- aren™t directly related in
 chronology. Did -- did your e
xperience during the war, or -
- i -- in some ways I feel like I have to as
k you ab out your parents at the same  time. Was

74
your religious faith interrupted in  any wa
y by what you™d been 
thro ugh, and what you 
saw in World War Two? 
A: In one sense I can say to you that -- I™
ll give you kind of a chicken answer, chicken 
meaning that I am unable to give anything el
se. Let me come back 
through a back door. 
One of the questions that has not been an
swered by me or anybody else, Einst ein 
included, is where the world ends, and wh at
™s beyond it. Well, since that cannot be 
answered, I don™t really bother myself -- I ha ven™t got the intellectual capacity anyhow to 
understand it, but even if I 
could -- do worry about it, I do
n™t know what™s beyond the 
end of the world. I don™t mean the end of th
e world, but the end of
 the, you know, the 
universe, and what™s there. I assu me that
 that™s where God picks up, but I can™t 
understand it in my own intellect. In the same
 sense, I cannot te
ll you why God permitted 
this to happen. I cannot understand it. As  a co nsequence, I look at my religious 
background, and my  religion as a historical
 connection. As a valid contribution to 
civilization, and in that sense it™s not interr
upted by wh at happened , and I™m not one of 
those who has said, I will now 
deny and blame 
God because he permitte
d this to happen. 
I don™t know if that™s true. In the grand sc
heme of things, I don™t understand the end of 
the universe, nor why this happened. There are 
other things I don™t understand, but this is 
the one th at you asked me about, 
so I™ll stay w
ith that, okay? 
Q: Did you have conversations with your pare
nts about this, or do 
you have any way of 
knowing how th ey felt about it? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
75
A: I can™t -- I™ve not committed to memory any conversations with them. I™m sure we 
did, I mean, you know, you are in a house, you 
are -- the three of us, we talk at dinner, we 
talk here and there. I™m sure we did. And 
I can™t tell you that I have a clear statement 

from them. Interestingly, from 
my mother™s si sters, the t w
o -- two sisters who both lost 
their husbands during the war, remarried, and 
lived out their lives 
in Israel. The two 
sisters -- th e daughter of one of the sisters, 
and their parents, my  grandparents, were taken 
to Auschwitz at the same
 time, an d the same place. The sist
ers were told to
 go to the left 
at Mengele™s hut. The daughter and the gran dparen
ts were told to go to the right, or vice-
a-versa. And you know what happened, the sist
ers survived. The sist er
s, particularly the 
youngest sister, who was the most recent, wa
s the last o n e to die, had some strong 
feelings about God, an
d why did you do th is. Di
dn™t blame, didn™t held up an ything, lived 
her life, but had. Sh e was the only one in th e family, but she was always the -- the 
doubting Thomas in the family
. She was the least impacted by religious upbringing, even 
though she grew up in
 the same household as my  mo ther
 did. So  what I™m saying to  you 
is that the family yes, in my parent™s 
home, I cannot give you an ex ample of the 
discussion being had about their feelings about 
God. I think that they -- no, I™ll g -- go the 
other way. I would susp ect that some of wh
at I said to you about my own thinking is 
consistent with their thinking, because it™s co
nnected to their thinking, and grows out of 
that. 

Q: I want to -- if you don™t mind, I™m going to
 look at my  notes, because -- have you been 
back to Budapest? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
76
A: Only once. Again, I™m going to go through 
the back door just a 
little bit. As the war 
ends we™re in Switzerland, and after some st
ay at a children™s home in Hayden, which is 
in [indecipherable] province, the German pr
ovince in Sw itzerland, we begin our journey 
south through Italy, to go to  
Palestine, actually. My mother
 did not want to go back to 
Budapest. We are sitting in  Taranto, which is a port city in -- 
Q: I don™t know why it did that 
-- want to go back to Budapest. 
A: Right. We are in fact now having by -- 
gone by train and by tr
uck through Italy to 
Taranto, wh ich is in the arch of the boot, 
to board a ship, actually became a British 

military ship, to transpor
t -- to take us to Haifa. My mo
ther receives a telegram from my 
father -- not the first time, I 
mean they had had contact, that
 says essentially, you know, 
things are this and that, and come on back
. And sh e says, mm -mm, she does not go back . 
Q: Hm. Afraid to go back? 
A: No, upset to go back. Sh e sa
id after what happened in Eu
rope, she is not going to go 
back to live in Europe. And afte
r that they visited in Germany,
 they visited 
in Yugoslavia 
-- 
Q: Careful with that, you can hear it. 
A: Sorry, sorry. 
Q: Yeah, that™s okay. 

A: In Yu goslavia and other places, she never we
nt back  to Budapest. My father did after 
my mother passed away. Having
 said that, we never went back until many years later, as 
a matter of fact we went back
 in -- about 15 years ago now, I recall the partic -- 1988, I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
77
had wanted my  wife to see Budapest, and 
1988 was soon after the Russians, and the 
Soviets and all that, and Budapest was begi
nning to reawaken. It was never under the 
heel. Budapest is one of the cities that is na
 -- did not have a Russian palace of culture, 
which is that wedding cake monstrosity that™s
 in the middle of Riga, and Warsaw , and 
lots of other places. So we did, we went back . We went back to see, and the impact was 
interesting because all the streets got smalle
r. Maybe because I got
 bigger. And the other 
thing, wh ich had nothing to  
do with me, there were cars 
parked on both sides of the 
street. Well, this is again, 1
988, not 1938. There were cars 
in Budapest 1930 -- my father 
never owned a car, nobody owned 
cars. That™s what taxis are 
for. You know, that™s what 
chauffeurs are for. And we used 
public transportation. But we
nt back, saw our apartment, 
saw much of the area that I was familiar with
, which was quite small -- I was a little kid. 
Ice skating rink, and the synagogue, and the lo
cation of my  father™s synagogue, and some 
other places. I have some non-family fami ly th ere, in that my  father™s second wife, my  
stepmother, who to this day lives strong and 
healthy at 93 in Philadelphia, has a niece -- 
two nieces, who are actually rela
ted only to her first husband
. But I know them, and they 
welcomed us to wash -- to wa
shingt -- to Budapest, and sp
ent some time, and -- and I™d 
like to go back, because I™d 
like to go back to eastern Hu
ngary, where my father was 
raised, and I was never there in my life, and 
I would also like to visit the graves of my 
grandfather, and some others. I™d like to do that
, while it™s still possible to do it. It is now 
possible, there was a time when you couldn™t 
do it. My father could not get back there, 
because it was then in -- under Russian contro
l, and U.S. and Russ
ia, and you know, it 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
78
was a catastrophe, you™d have to go th rough 
Moscow, and th e [indecipherable] now, you 
don™t. My father was born in Hungary, became
 a Czech  citizen, it is now the Ukraine. It 
tells you something. Bu t I did go 
back to Budapest, thought it 
was very nice, it was very 
much like I remembered, 
much of it. Am I familiar with it?
 Yes, with 35 square blocks, 
not the city, which is first of all grown an
d changed. Bu t my  Budapest was very warm 
and fuzzy to me.  
Q: Did you by any chance feel the 
need to go to Bergen -B elsen? 
A: Need, no, desire yes. And it just had no
t been the opportunity
. I would very much 
want to go -- first I want to see -- although
 there™s nothing in  Bergen -Belsen ex cept for 
memorial, and the land. I™d like to
 have my wife see it. As a ma
tter of fact, I w ent for the 
first time in my life to Auschw
itz, in 1994 with a program ca
lled the March of the Living, 
I don™t know if you™re fam
iliar, if the -- the familiar
ity, but kids go on -- on Yom 
HaShoah, on the day of the comm emoration of the Ho locaust, 6,000 young people -- 

young, up to not so young, c
onvene and march from Auschwitz 
to Birkenau, which is ver 
-- which is Auschwitz two, which is what y
ou see where all the huts are. Have you been 
there? 
Q: Mm-mm. 
A: Alright. Auschwitz itself is
 an old prison, an army  barr
ack, and it™s brick. That™s 
where you see the sign, Arbeit mac -- macht fre
i, and two miles away, or thereabouts, 
maybe three, I don™t recall, it™s not a very 
long distance, is Birkenau, which is the 
enormous -- you see the pictures of -- firs
t of all the train  pulls in, in the Shoah 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
79
documentary, and that™s where you have all thes
e huts, and all these kind of barracks that 
became -- that™s where Mengele had his shop, 
and things like that. And that™s the first 
time in my life, and maybe the last time I was 
there, except I™d like to have my wife see 
it. But I had no other Auschwitz things. I™d 
like to go to Bergen-B
elsen because I™d like 
to visit where I was as a ch
ild. I™ve seen documentaries, 
and tapes, and movies, and 
spoken to  people who™ve gone back, which is
 perfectly okay, but I™d like to see it. All 
wants, no need to go. I don™t have to go and ne
ed to visit graves there, I have no graves 
there. 

Q: Mm-hm. Of the 1600 that were there with
 you, are you in touch with any of them? 
A: Well, I™m in touch with the professor at 
Lansing, I™m in touch with the professor in 
Brooklyn, who was in [indecipherable]. I™m
 in touch with another man who was in 
Turish. Now, the touch doesn™t me
an daily touch, but has been -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- we know each other, we know -- if I we
re to go to Turish, I 
would look him up. If I 
went to New Yo rk, I would lo ok him up, and 
I went to Michigan 
[indecipherable] and I 
would like to believe that if they came to 
town, and they  had a spare two hours, they 
would do the same thing. Be
yond that, the only other peopl
e that I knew who were with 
us was a couple and their daughter who live in 
Ph iladelphia. He is gone, the wife is aged 
and not completely here, although she™s aliv
e. And th e daughter is a little younger than  I, 
we did not grow up together, she has no reco
llection. And although we were at the same 
place at the same time for half a year, th
at™s the only thi
ng that connects us.

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, and y
ou™ve been back to Isra
el, because you still had -- 
A: Oh many times, many times. 
Q: -- cousins there. 
A: Well, I went back with groups, I went back
 by myself. I was in Israel two years ago, 
well, it™s g o nna be three years now, just da
ys before we left on a -- on a Thursday, and 
Intifada started the next day. I went to a 
cousin™s kid™s wedding. My son and I had a 
father and son tour. Just the two of us went. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And a [indecipherable] Israel in -- in ™49, I 
went back in ™57, went
 back in ™65 - ™69 - 
™73, then not until ™85 - ™88 - ™91 - ™94 -- 

Q: Oh my , you™ve been  there a lot.  

A: -- and 2000? Well, anyhow, a dozen  times or
 thereabouts. I™m quite comfortable there, 
quite familiar, always something new to see,
 we always do so mething th at we haven™t 
done befo re, although the bulk of
 the visits have been for th
e purpose of s-seeing family, 
which now is mo re difficult. The aunts are 
gone, an uncle is gone, their spouses are gone. 
But they died becau
se everybody does. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: In their 80™s. 

Q: What do you want to say that I haven™t 
asked you ab out? Anything -- I mean, it™s a big 
subject, and you™ve been interviewed a numb er of times, but -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
81
A: Well, I could also say wh at would you like 
to ask that you haven™t asked. No. Yeah. I 
made some  notes. 
Q: Good. 
A: You asked about it, but I don™t think I 
responded. Effects of the Holocaust on me. 
Clearly, although I can™t prove 
it, I would not have been  an only ch ild if not fo r the 
Holocaust. My parents -- well, 
actually I™m not an only ch
ild, my  parents had a child 
before I was born. 
Q: Right, a brother, yeah. 

A: Who was born perfectly healthy and 10 weeks 
he died  of starvation, and I think I said 
very clearly, that had nothing 
to do with the ava
ilability of food or medical h elp, he 
couldn™t absorb. I™d like to see his grave. My
 brother, as it were. But I would have had -- 
remember, in 1936 when I wa
s born, my mother was 28, my
 father was 32, clearly in 
child-bearing years. So that I think I would ha
ve had siblings, or sibling, but my  father 
wasn™t home, which made it diffic u lt, 
and the times were not conducive.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So one of the results of 
the Holocaust, I think, and ma
 -- my wife is not Holocaust 
connected, she has one sister. Why didn™t they
 have seven child -- I don™t know. But I 
would have had a sibling. The 
other thing I would say to you is that I think -- now, again 
I can™t tell you this is Holo
caust connected, or it™s because I am w h at I am an d I was 
made how I was made. But I have thought ab
out, and folks -- some
 folk -- some folks 
have said -- sorry, you can hear that, thank 
you -- some folks have said that I missed 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 
 
 
 
82
elements of childhood. I was never a kid, or ne
ver a kid fo r too long in any one place. It™s 
difficult, even with the resiliency of kids. 
First grade was in Hungary, second grade was 
in Bergen-Belsen -- if you want to call it th
at. Third grade was in s -- in Switzerland, 
fourth  grade was in kibbutz -- different language
. Fifth grade, sixth grade, part of seventh 
was in Haifa. Then English in
 New York, then Philadelphia.
 So you talk about I don™t 
know how many schools, and certainly thre
e languages. Makes it difficult to spend time 
being a kid. Now, what would I have done as
 a kid? I can™t tell you. Because I certainly 
have recollections having birt
hday parties, and not having a 
bicycle, and then  having a 
bicycle. I don™t remember missing things as a 
kid. Being with family, and some cousins. 
But I still think that there was a requirement 
of me, maybe because the way I am, to have 
been an adult much earlier th
an I would have been, had it not been  for the Ho locaust. 
And I will leave that with an obse
rvation, leave it at that. Okay? 
Q: Okay? Good. Let me -- have to state th
e ending.This conclu
