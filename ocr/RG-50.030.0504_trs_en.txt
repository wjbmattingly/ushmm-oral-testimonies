Q: Right. Let™s talk a little b
it about your home life. What wa

A: My Dad™s name  was August. He was a physic

Q: Wo w.  

A: And he ma rried later in life, he was 40 year

Q: Right, right. And your mother™s name ?  

A: My mother™s name was Betty, he
r ma iden name  was Lewy, L-e-w-y.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

A: And in German it was pronounced Levy. But it™s Lewy in -- 
Q: Over here. 

A: [indecipherable] would 
like it s -- being spelled. 
Q: Right. 

A: Most time Levy is with a -- a v, this was with a w. 

Q: So, let™s talk about what your earliest me mo
ries of home life in -- in Germany, what -- do you 
reme mber what it was like?  Do you reme mber y
our apartme nt, or your 
hou -- did you live in a 
house or apartment? 

A: No, we had a big apartment, actually it were
 two apartments that were opened up together. 

Half of the m was my fat her™s offices and practice, 
and the other half is where we lived. I can still 
see it in my eyes, it was a long, drawn out ap
artment, there wa s a big living room, and dining 
room that were connected together. Then there was a long hall that was long enough for me  to 

ride my tricycle on. At the other end were th
e bedrooms, and big bath
room, and all that. And 
then there we re about three rooms that were my 
fa ther™s offices. One thing I reme mber in that 
big hallway, we had an icebox, I mean, not a 
refrigerator, but an 
icebox. It was pink. 
Q: Pink? 

A: Pink icebox. And you know, in summer the ic
eman ca me  by in his horse and buggy and 
brought up those big pieces of
 ice to put in there. 
Q: When you say icebox, it means that there™s ic
e that™s ma ke -- ma king the area cold so you can 
have food in there, or is it just for ice? 

A: No, ice for -- like a refr
igerator, but not electric. 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
4 
 
A: It was a -- I mean, we had electricity, and 
we had running water, and 
regular toilets and all 
that, but ma ny of the mo dern electri
cal stuff we didn™t have as yet. 
Q: Right. And how often did this guy 
come  with the ice, do you reme mb er? 
A: No, I couldn™t tell you that honestl
y. My guess would be about once a week. 
Q: Uh-huh. But they were these hug
e, big pieces of ice, right? 
A: Those huge, big pieces of ice, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- the me lting of the ice truck do
wn, ran behind it as little kids to
 get some  of that cold water 
on your face -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- on a hot, sunny day. 

Q: Did you have your own bedroom? 

A: No, my - -  I shared it with 
my brother. And we got along fi ne. 
Q: You did? 

A: Most of the -- most of the time. 

Q: Five years is a big. 

A: No, it™s actually four years. 

Q: Four year -- four years, rath
er. It™s a pretty big difference. 
A: Yes, it is a big difference, 
and we did have our fights, of 
course he was bigger and stronger 
than I, some times very aggravating. He would ju
st hold out his hand and 
I couldn™t get anywhere 
near him. But we did fine. I wasn™t very aware 
of us being different from other kids in the 
neighborhood and the building. The building was ow
ned by a ma n who has the carpentry shop in 
the back. There was a little alley where we played
 in, and then there was 
this big factory, where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
5 
 
you heard the machinery going almost day and 
night. We ll, not night 
of course, but I do 
reme mber that very well. 
Q: Right. So was this a -- a mi xed neighbor
hood, or were you the only Jews in the neighborhood 
that you remember?   

A: Um. 

Q: When you said that y
ou didn™t feel different -- 
A: We  were little bit on the outskirts, not a subur
b like you see here, but in a working class area. 
Not in the downtown area of our little town. And 
most of the Jewish family lived more in the 
downtown area. So there were not too ma ny Jewi
sh people living there,
 but we -- the town 
wasn™t that big to begin with -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- so we had good contact with them. The st
reetcar ran right in front of our house, and 
streetcar was a single track. And in the front of
 our house there was a bike path. So when one 
came from one side, the ot
her one had to wait -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- for it to come  from the other side. And -- bu
t we walked most places. We  walked to school, 
and walked to the synagogue and all that. 

Q: We re you religious, was the fa
mi ly religious [indecipherable] 
A: No, not religious at all. My mother™s family wa
s religious, but we were 
not at all, my father 
was not at all. However, we did belong to th
e synagogue with -- my parents had the respective 
seats there. On high holidays that me
n sat downstairs, the wome n upstairs. 
Q: So it was -- was it Orthodox? 

A: It was Conservative -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
6 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- it wasn™t Orthodox. 

Q: It™s a very -- rather Conservative. 

A: A little. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Leaning on the Conservative -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- side, but -- 

Q: So you didn™t go on a regular basi
s every week, you went on holidays? 
A: We  did go frequently on Friday night. 

Q: You did? 

A: In fact, we also attended what we wouldcall Sunday school here, but actually Hebrew school. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And three boys and three girls always got cal
led up for Kiddush onto the beamer, and the joke 
was that my brother didn™t care for the wine but
 he had to drink it, but
 I enjoyed it every time 
that I got up there. 
Q: Enjoy -- 

A: My mother was more religious than my fath
er, but we didn™t keep kosher or anything like 
that. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: No.  

Q: Did -- did your mother li
ght candles on Friday night? 
A: Most of the time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
7 
 
Q: Most of the time, uh-huh. 
A: And quite often we had friends
 over for Friday night dinner. 
Q: I see. 

A: But, you know, candle lighting wa s about as fa r as
 we went. My mother did fast on yi -- Yom 
Kippur. 

Q: Did you? 

A: Not until I was Bar Mitzvah and then I 
fasted and most of the time  still do. 
Q: Really? That™s interesting. 

A: But that™s about the only 
thing I™m sort of keeping. 
Q: It is. Ri ght. So what was home  life like?  
Did you all eat lunch togeth
er since your father was 
working there?  Did he take off l
unchtime and have lunch with you? 
A: Not necessarily, he -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- but we had lunch --
 we had servants, we had the -- my fa
ther had a nurse for his office. We  
had a live in ma id. 
Q: Oh, you did? 

A: And she took care of the house, but she didn™t 
take care of the kids, my mother took care of 
my brother and I. 

Q: That™s interesting. 

A: We  took ma ny walks. The little town was quite
 picturesque. Had nice parks that we went 
through. And my father, having lived there for su
ch a long time, was well known in the city. Old 
type physician, he got called ou
t at night quite frequently. 
Q: So he was well known as a physician as well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
8 
 
A: As a physician as well -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- especially in the ne
ighborhood that we were in. 
Q: Uh-huh. Was he a general practitioner? 

A: Yes, he was. 

Q: So he did all sorts of things, but he didn™t do surgery, I gather? 

A: He did not do surgery. There were other 
people who were there who did surgery. 
Q: Right. 

A: And took trips to the little 
farms outside, and I often went with him. I reme mber going with 
him on a -- to a farm and get s -- got scared 
when all these big dogs and what have you came 
snooping around the car while he was in there with hi
s patient. And as I got a little older, learned 
to ride a bike, ma ny of the calls he ma de wereby bicycle, and I went with him on a bicycle. It 

was on one of those trips where I wa
s riding in front of him, a nd we
 talked back and forth, all of 
a sudden I don™t -- didn™t get an answer. I look 
around and I see him off the bike, he had had a 
heart attack. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: A very severe heart attack. It
 was a friend of ours, not living 
too far from where we were, we 
went to her house and called a taxi 
to take us home . And this was hi
s first, and very severe heart 
attack.  

Q: Huh. And do you reme mber what 
year that was?  Wa s that befo
r -- must have been before 
Kristallnacht . 

A: Yes, this was before Kristallnacht . It
 was ma ybe one or two years before that. 
Q: So you were quite young? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
9 
 
A: I was six years old or so. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And -- 

Q: So your brother was not traveling 
with your dad on bicycle, just -- 
A: No, my brother went through the elementary 
school in our town, and then when it came  for 
him to go to high school he wa
s transferred to Breslau. 
Q: Oh. 

A: Now called Wr oclaw, where my mother™s fam
ily lived. And he lived with one of my uncle 
and aunt™s and attended 
school there. So he wasn™t home at the time. 
Q: I see, I see. So did your dad go to
 the hospital, or did he stay home?  
A: He stayed home . 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He got taken care of at home. 
Q: Wa s he then able to go back to his me dical 
pr actice after the heart at
tack, or did that -- 
A: Yes, but it took quite a few months.  
Q: It did? 

A: Quite a few months, and he 
was all right then. It was prob
ably -- probably in early 1938, 
because after he got well, we decided to move to
 a smaller apartment. And it was in that smaller 
apartment where we then experienced the Kristallnacht. 

Q: I see. So Hitler and the Nazis take over in 1933, so you™re -- there -- something is going on. 

Do you notice a change -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- as you™re growing up? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
10 
 
A: I -- I didn't  notice a change, 
really, because all I knew was -- 
Q: Wa s that. 
A: -- Hitler. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, all I knew was the Nazi governme nt. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, at three years you have
 no knowledge of what is going on. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: The street we lived on, there were often pa
rades moving along the street
, and as a little child 
you love -- you love a parade -- 

Q: Sure. 

A: -- you like to be out there 
and cheering them on with the 
other kids. And some how I knew 
I™m not supposed to cheer these people on. But it was very difficult for me  to fully understand 
what there was. 
Q: Right. Did your parents ta
lk to you about this -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- at all, and say, you know, don™t 
go out there, be careful, or -- 
A: Th -- be careful, don™t go out there, and tha 
-- but they left it fair
ly open. [indecipherable] 
other words, they didn™t ma ke too much of a deal out of it. But I always knew certain things we 

can™t do. Just certain rules we as
 Jews couldn™t do. Because my  pa
rents had a live in maid, they 
celebrated Christma s in a way, in fact we had a 
Christma s tree. The ma id wanted it of course, 
and so we celebrated Christma s. And one year my
 parents called my brother and I together and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
11 
 
said, we™re not going to celebrate
 Christma s any more, we™re goi
ng to celebrate Chanukah from 
now on. And our ma in question was,
 will we still get gifts.  
Q: Right. 
A: And long as that was the case, we didn™t care. 

Q: Didn™t care, right. Now, did your ma id have to
 leave at -- I -- I™m assumi ng that she was not 

Jewish, the maid? 

A: She was not Jewish. 

Q: Did she have to leave your
 household at a certain point? 
A: Yes. A certain point, the law came about th
at she had to be, I think fo -- 35 or 45 -- 
Q: I think it™s 45 [indecipherable] 

A: 45 old, and this was a very young person, an
d she had to leave the house at mi dnight, 
December 31
st
, whatever year it was. And she stayed ti
l the very last mi nute, and then left. And 
my parents actually found some body else, 40 f -- was 
just 45, to take over. This person had been 
a cook in a sanitarium, she knew how to cook very
 well, and she taught my
 mother how to cook. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The second -- they we re both called Marthe, th
e second Marthe. And when we mo ved into the 
smaller apartment and she didn™t come wi -- come with us. 

Q: She didn™t come . So when you had the ma i
d, the ma id was  cleaning and cooking, and -- 
A: Cleaning and cooking. 

Q: -- your mother was taking care of the two of you. 

A: Right. Of course, the ma id 
was there as a babysitter -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- when my parents wanted to go out. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
12 
 
Q: So you spent a lot of time with
 both of your parents, I gather. 
A: Lot of time with my moth
er, because my father was -- 
Q: Wa s working, right. 
A: Working quite hard. But we fr
equently took vacations. In fact, 
we were fairly close to the 
Czech border. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And over a weekend we would go into Czech
oslovakia, just to get out of there. 
Q: Right. And how would you travel, by train? 

A: By car. 

Q: By car? You had a car? 

A: My father had a car. The car was not park
ed at the house because you couldn™t, you know, it 
was in a garage ma ybe a mile away. 

Q: Right. 
A: And you had to get it from there. But we trav
eled by car all over the 
place, quite often. Then 
when we we nt into Breslau to live with my
 mother™s family, we often went by train. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And my grandmother, when she came to vi
sit us, came by train. And where my brother was 
going to school in Breslau, on the weekend he came
 home and frequently I used to pick him up 
at the train station and we would 
walk home , just the two of us. 
Q: Right, right. Did you mi ss hi m when he was aw
ay?  When -- or was it actually nice for you to 

be able to be al
one in the house?   
A: I honestly can™t answer 
that. I don™t -- I don™t know. 
Q: Okay, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
13 
 
A: I don™t know. I -- I guess 
it was a little bit of both. 
Q: Right. 
A: He was always my bi g brother, he was always
 there to help me  out, 
all my life. And I don™t 
know whether I felt it™s nice to be alone. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I-I don™t think I di d. Because I we
nt to sc hool by this time  also.  
Q: You started school when, 
when you were six or five? 
A: Six. 

Q: When you were six. 

A: But when I was five years old I went 
to a nursery school, a kindergarten, I mean -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- here we -- it™s part of the school system, th
ere it was separate. The same  lady was  in charge 
of that kindergarten that was in charge when my
 brother went there. And by this time  it was 1935 
or so. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And, you know -- you know, it™s 1935, and I reme mber
 very clearly the door ringing at our 
house, and I opened the door. There is Miss Schroe
der with a big bouquet of 
flowers, and tears in 
her eyes, comi ng to see my mother. Well, it turned 
out that one of the othe
r kids, five year old 
kid, his parents objected to t-to be
ing -- to having a Jew in his kindergarten class. So this was my 
first experience of anti-Semitism. So obviously 
I had to leave, and Miss Schroeder couldn™t do 
anything, and this guy wa s also a physician, the fath
er of this other kid. So I had to leave. But 
this was shortly before I had to enter regular sc
hool. And when my mother took me  to school my 
first day of school, it turned out th
at that same  kid would be in th
e same  class as me . So she went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
14 
 
to the principal, explained the situation, and he put 
me  into a parallel class. Turned out that I was 
the only Jewish kid in the whole school, but
 at  least I wasn™t in with this one. 
Q: And no one else complaine
d, it was this -- it was this -- 
A: I-In the ki ndergarten it was this particular 
person. And I made friends in school, like  any kid. 
Got real friendly with two other boys, they were 
separate, boys and girls we
re separate in that 
school. And one kid had a birthday 
party, he invited me , the other 
one was fine, and of course 
my time to have a birthday part
y, I invited both of them, they 
both said they™d come . The next 
day one of them said, ﬁI™m sorry, but my parents won™t let me come .ﬂ  
Q: Oh. 

A: And I reme mbered his name , his name  was 
Webber, his last name  was Webber. Many years 
later, I was in the amer -- I was this G.I. in th
e American army, stationed back in Europe, and I 
tried to ma ke contact with my for mer  teach
er. And some body wrote me , my name  is Webber, 
you must reme mber, you went to school with my br
other, and basically th
ey wanted some  help. 
So I wrote him back, yes I reme mber him very well.
 You didn™t want to ha
ve any contact with a 
Jew, now you do?  But the nice thing 
at that point was that I ma de
 contact with my grade school 
teacher. He was a wonderful person. When Crystal Night came about, I went to school. The 

synagogue was far enough away from us that I didn™
t see what was going on, we were not in the 
downtown area where all this Jewish
 retail stores got ruined. And I 
found out in school what had 
occurred. And when I came home, my mother recei
ved me  at the door in tears. My father ha d 
been called out to some body who had been beaten
 by the Gestapo. And while he was in that 
person™s house, they came to our house to -- for my
 father. He was then pi
cked up at his patient™s 
home  and taken to prison. And af
ter that, every day, this teacher,
 his name  was Thiel, came and 
sat on -- next to me  on my chair, is your dad 
home yet?  Every day. After five days my da -- dad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
15 
 
did come  home . The chi e f of police in our litt
le town took it upon hims elf not to send anybody to 
the concentration camp t hat had been an offi
cer in the German army. And as a physician, my 
father was a lieut enant during World War 
1
, so after five days he cam
e home . Right after he came  
home  the word came out that Jews are not allowe d 
to go to public school any more. So they kept 
me  home, my parents kept me  ho
me . Mr. Thiel, when he saw me  
on the street afterwards, would 
stop his -- jump off his bike, he used to trav
el around bike, and see how I was doing. And when 
my birthday came around, he came to our house to br
ing all the papers, and 
all the books that I 

had. And he told my mot her he was so glad that
 I didn™t show up that day because the principal 
sent some body in, you™ve got the only Jew in th
e whole school, send him 
home. And he hadn™t -- 
didn™t have to do that in front 
of the other kids. So I got in contact with him in 1951 - ™52. We  
have corresponded for awhile, he was in a li
ttle town too far off the beaten track -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- for me to visit him. 
Q: But he must -- he was quite
 different, right, he just -- 
A: He -- he -- he wasn™t -- 
Q: -- he must have been taking a chance to do what he was doing. 

A: He took a big chance -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- with what he was doing. 

Q: How did this affect you [indecipherable] 
as a little boy?  Do you re -- do you reme mber? 
A: I don™t know how to answer th
at, how it affected me , it™s -- in
 a way I took it in stride. It 
became normal. The discrimi nation against you b
ecame a normal thing. Sounds ridiculous if I 
say it now, but that™s the feeling I have. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
16 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And -- 

Q: No, but it ma kes sense. It become
s part of the patte
rn of your life. 
A: It become s the pattern of life -- excuse me  -- 
as I said, my  brother was in Breslau, and he was 
in Breslau at Crystal Night. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He came home  some how or anot
her, just be with us. But shor
tly after that was his birthday, 
his 13
th
 birthday, his Bar Mitzvah. There was no Tora
h left in Liegnitz because the synagogue 
got burned. So he brought his Tora
h home from Breslau. Some of 
the little shuls were in areas 
that they couldn™t burn, and ther
e was a few Torahs left. He carri
ed one on the train from Breslau 
back to Liegnitz. And we had the Bar Mitzvah 
in our house. And where we lived, that smaller 
apartment, the second and third floor was a Je
wish old age home , and we shared a larger 

apartment with anot her family. And that™s wh
ere we had his Bar Mitz
vah. Many people had 
come home from concentration camp. This is 1938. 
We  have -- the family showed that they have 
intentions of leaving, they got 
out of the concentration camp. 
Q: Right. 
A: I reme mb er these people comi ng home with shaven heads. 

Q: You do? 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: We re you told where they had come  from?  

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You had.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

A: Yeah. I mean, concentration camp was an ever
yday word. An uncle of mi ne, the one that my 
brother lived with, in the fa mily, he was taken in
to concentration camp earlier than Kristallnacht. 
There was some  activity, I forgot what they
 called it, where if you 
had any -- done anything 
illegal years before, you end up -- 
you got taken into prison again. 
My uncle did some  cheating, I 
guess, on the income  tax, I don™t know, at one point it got punitive action, he paid his penalty, 
but that wasn™t enough. They used that excuse to 
take him. And he couldn™t take it, he went up 
against the electric fence, got killed right then 
and there. My mother had a picture of him in 
Shanghai, and had it on one of the tables, a ma n 
came in one time, he sa
id, I know this ma n. I 
saw him getting shot against the ca -- against the fence.  

Q: Wo w. 

A: And -- 

Q: This is your mother -- one of your mother™s brothers? 

A: My mother™s sister™s husband. 
Q: Sister™s husband, I see. 
A: And, so all these things were 
told to me , I heard about them. 
Q: Right. 

A: Wa s all part of our life. 

Q: Right. 

A: They had sent their son to England to go to 
school, Cambridge. That™s why they had the room 
free for my brother to live in. 

Q: Right. Do -- and your brother came  back afte r Kristallnacht? 

A: He came back -- I™m not even sure at this poi
nt whether he continued his schooling in Breslau 
or not. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
18 
 
Q: Or not, uh-huh. 
A: But I didn™t go back to a regular school. 

Q: Right. 

A: I had the young woman come  in to sta 
-- give me  tutoring, private lessons. 
Q: And the Bar Mitzvah, was that
 in your house, or was that in
 the -- the home for the aged? 
A: In the home for the aged. 

Q: I see. So were there 
a number of people there? 
A: There™s quite a few people there. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: Yeah, and a little anecdote, my mother had 
a big dinner for everybody 
and turned out that it 
were -- we were 13 people. She 
was superstitious, so she quickly called a good friend who was a 
bachelor to come  join us. 

Q: That™s great. We ™re going to have to change the tapes. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Okay. I think we forgot to 
get the name of
 your brother. 
A: Oh, my brother™s name  is 
o -- as he was born was Hans. 
Q: Right. 
A: H-a-n-s. But he changed it to 
Henry when we became Americanized. 

Q: American. And did he take the n off?  The double -- 

A: Yes.  

Q: So it -- he™s Culman too, with one n? 

A: With one n. The only one who 
wouldn™ttakeit off was my mo
ther. She said, ﬁI ma rried your 
father with two n™s and I™m going to keep the two n™s.ﬂ 

Q: Keep it that way. 

A: And my father had alrea
dy passed away by that time. 
Q: I see. Before we get to what happens afte
r Kristallnacht, let me  just ask you w-w -- ho-how 
you reme mb er being in the house?  Was it a -- a ve
ry cheerful kind of home  to be in, was it 
serious, or it was a comb ination -- 

A: No, it was a ch -- it wa s a cheerful home . 
We  had no, you know, I have no bad me mories of 

that at all. Played out in the backyard with 
the other kids, and played cowboys and Indians and 
we got dressed up, and these were all non-Je
wish kids that lived in that area. 
Q: Right. 

A: The river was not -- was two or
 three blocks away. And in wint
er that™s where we dragged our 
sled and sled -- sled down the side of the ri
verbank. In the spring and summer it was a beautiful 
area to walk. I reme mber walking there with my 
mother and at the end of
 the trail, bu -- ther e 
was some  fa rmyard which usually had some  pigl
ets there, and so -- it
™s all very pleasant 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
20 
 
me mories. The unpleasant parts were like I me ntione
d, the fact that I got kicked out of nursery 
school, had the problems in school, then couldn™t 
go there. But most of the unpleasant me mories 
are actually things I heard about
. You know, my parents talked about
 this person got taken to jail 
for whatever reason, that person 
disappeared. And most of it didn™
t really get bad for me until 
Kristallnacht . 
Q: Uh-huh. Did your -- did your pa
rents take you to the f -- wa
s there a theater, were there 

children™s theater, do you 
have any recollection? 
A: No, th -- 

Q: Was there movies? 

A: There was movies. 

Q: [indecipherable] movies. 

A: There were movies.  

Q: And did you like the movies? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You did? 

A: Saw Laurel and Hardy, and things like that. 

Q: You did? 

A: But there was a theater that my parents atte
nded, I mean adult theater, but I don™t reme mber 
going to the theater at all. [indeciphera
ble] And movies you 
didn™t go that often. 
Q: Right. 

A: In summer there was ice cream stands, it wasn
™t like here where you 
could eat ice cream all 
year long, you just ate it in summer. 

Q: Summertime, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
21 
 
A: And then once in a ye -- once a year a circus
 came  to town, I reme mbe r  going to that. But I 
had no unpleasant me m -- personal me mories. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Personally, they didn™t get bad. Eventually, after 
I™ve said this I realize 
that that wasn™t quite 
true. There used to be kids that used to attack 
me  and start hitting on me , called me  a Jew, and all 
kinds of name s. But didn™t happen that ofte
n. When I came home from Hebrew school, I 
reme mber once being attacked by three or four kids. It was -- 

Q: Did they hurt you? 

A: We ll, not seriously, you know. 

Q: Did you fight back? 

A: No, I ran. 

Q: You ran. Probably smarte
r with three or four 
kids against you, right? 
A: Yeah. The other thing that I reme mber is in
 school there were religious classes, and that 
religion was taught in school. My ini
tial teacher, Mr. Thiel used to 
tell me , well, just sit in class 
and don™t participate. And then one year I got an
ot her teacher and he had me leave the classroom 
for the religious class. And some  of the other 
kids had s -- said, I didn™t know you we re Jewish. 
They didn™t realize I was. And th
at was tough because I went outsi
de, I was the only one in the 
whole school, for an hour. It wasn™t long enough 
to go home, so I just wandered around the area 
and then got back into class. So the fact
 that I was set aside was hard to take. 
Q: Now your f -- your father had his 
heart attack, it was 1936, am I right? 
A: No, I-I think it was either ™37 or  ™38. 

Q: So a -- a --  

A: Just -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
22 
 
Q: -- so ma ybe a year before Kristallnacht? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did he lose his job at 
this point as a doctor?  

A: Oh he -- no, he -- 

Q: Wa s he not allowed to practice, or he was? 

A: He was still allowed to practice, and at one
 point he was not allowe
d to practice any more 
except for Jews. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: In our town -- I don™t know how ma ny Jewis h doc
tors there were, but he was the one that was 
assigned to practice for Jews. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  a significant differenc
e in -- in -- in him, once that happened? 
A: Yes. He became muc h more serious to me
, much more ver -- worried about everything. 

Seriously starting to talk about emigrating, gett
ing out of Germany. Started to check into going 
to Palestine. And this was before Crystal Night.
 Then, after Crystal Nigh
t we made contact with 
far enough relatives in the United States. Our papers
 at the office, the Palestine office got burned, 
so everything there got -- had to
 be started from s c ratch again. 
Q: This was burned during Kristallnacht? 

A: Crystal Ni ght. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: And, you know, in my mi nd as a child, I was l
ooking forward to this big trip we™re going to 
take someplace, somewhere. And some people started talking about going to Shanghai. 

Shanghai, being an international 
city, it -- you didn™t need any pape
rs, any visas, or anything like 
that. All you needed was to get on a ship and ge
t there. But it had a 
bad reputation, and people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
23 
 
didn™t want to go there, including my parents. 
So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends 
over the house for a dinner -- I 
don™t know if it was a Friday night
 dinner or not, but one person 
said, you know what?  I™m not sticking around he
r any more. I™m going to Shanghai. Second 
person said I™ll join you, my fath
er said, I™ll join 
you. If that wouldn™t have happened, we 
probably would have been stuck in Ge rmany. By th
is time  we  had an affidavit from the United 
States and in my parent™s mi
nd we™ll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets 
called up and then we go to the States. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And that™s how we eventually ended up in Shanghai. 

Q: Did they tell you anything a
bout Shanghai when they si -- ma
de this decision? Or had you 
heard that this was -- 

A: I just heard -- 

Q: -- that this was a strange place. 
A: It™s a strange place, you know, I looked it up on 
an atlas where it is. In the meantime, my -- a 
couple of my uncles her -- moo -- moved to Panama , and I followed on the atlas where they 
went, you know, we all -- all the trip
s of course were by ship, it wa
sn™t by plane. So he stopped 
at ma ny different places. And I was looking forward 
to this adventure. So we decided to go on a 
Dutch liner instead of a German or Italian like
 most people did. The advantage on a Dutch liner 
is that the so-called board money, you could take
 right out. The Germans allowed you x number 
of dollars, or ma rks, of c ourse, to take on board 
the ship, to spend on the ship, but not to take off 
the ship. So when you went on a German liner, they
 strictly adhere to that. On the Dutch liner 
that we went to, the purser said to my father
, well didn™t you lose x number of dollars gambling 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
24 
 
last night?  Di dn™t you buy a box of 
cigars?  And all that was writte
n down and two days after we 
left Europe, he had all 
his money in his pocket. 
Q: Right. 
A: Whatever amount that was.  

Q: Do you reme mber packing for Shanghai? 

A: Oh yes, very well. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: To get all your heavy stuff on, 
you got from the freight compa
ny some thing they called a lift, 
which was like a big box, size of a room, and ever
ything gets put in ther
e. And when you were 
packing that, some body from the Gestapo was th
ere watching what you were packing. We ll, 
when they came  to do this packing, my mother 
sent me outside to play. And I had some play 
money, which was back from the German inflation 
in the 20™s, had absolutely no value. And she 
was getting ready to pack that, 
and the guy from the Gestapo was 
-- put up a fuss, you can™t take 
that. And she was arguing, that™s 
my kid™s play money, it has no value. I don™t know for sure any 
more whether we left -- let him 
keep it or not, but I told my 
mother, ﬁLet him have it, I don™t 
care.ﬂ You know, it™s just play money. 

Q: So did you come  in and out when --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- when these guys were there? 

A: Yes, yes, I walked in and -- 

Q: We re they nasty?  Wh at were they like? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
25 
 
A: They were actually a little nasty at the begi
nning and then my mother gave them a drink, and 
they calmed down a bit. And some
 of the little knickknacks that we
 had, she gave one person this 
and one person that. It wa sn™t 
really bribery in any sense, 
but it softens them up in a way. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And my parentsalsohad the 
idea that ma ybe we can get off the ship some where before we 
get to Shanghai. I mean, India was still part of
 Britain, the Philippines was part of the United 
States, Singapore was partof Britain. We  thought we could ma ybe get off there. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So they decided that this 
lift with all our belongings shoul
d be kept by the freight company 
until they got the word fro m us. 

Q: Uh-huh. Instead of going on the shi -- 

A: Instead -- instead of being ship
ped at the same time as we were. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I mean, the ship we were on was a passenger 
ship, it wasn™t a freighter, and the lift would 
have to go on a freighter. The -- obviously we didn't  get off anyplace. Ende d up in Shanghai and 
then contacted the freight compa
ny, she -- send it to us, this is our
 address. But in the me antime 
it™s July of 1939. By the time this 
lift gets onto a freighter it™s Se
ptember, and the war breaks out. 

And all German ships get the signa
l, go into a neutral port. The Du
tch is -- East Indies, which are 
now Indonesia, were still neutral, 
so the ship ran into a neutral por
t in Dutch East Indies, and we 
had to pay a fair amount of money to
 get it from t here to Shanghai. 
Q: Get it to Shanghai. 

A: But eventually we got it all.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
26 
 
Q: When -- when your mother was packing the lift,
 did you have to pack a little suitcase, or did 
she pack it for you? 
A: She packed it. 

Q: She packed it. 

A: She packed it all. I mean, I 
didn™t do any packing per se.  
Q: You didn™t?  We re you able -- 
did she take any toys for you? 
A: Oh yeah, we took some toys. 

Q: Or game s ?  

A: Ga me s, yeah.  

Q: Did you -- so you had that on the ship with you? 

A: We  had some  of it on the ship, and some  of it wa
s on the fr eight -- in the 
-- in the lift. So I had 
a few toys, to [indecipherable] 

Q: This is a long trip. You go to Genoa, righ
t, so you have to take a train to Genoa. 
A: We  took a train to Genoa. 
We  took a train through Germa ny to say good-bye to relatives. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: My father™s brother was in Upper Silesia. We 
had tried to talk hi m to join us in shan -- to 
Shanghai and he refused. So we went there, we 
went to Berlin to say good-bye to some  for mer 
friends and relatives and to the western -- I m
ean, we really did a whole tour around Ge rmany by 
train and eventually came  to Genoa . 

Q: And wha t  happened to your car? 
Did your father sell the car? 
A: I guess he sold it, I mean --  

Q: Okay. 

A: I never thought about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
27 
 
Q: Right. 
A: But he must have sold it. When we came 
to the border, they ha
d everybody get off -- not 
everybody, all the Jews get off the train to be 
searched, body searched. And this was mi ddle of 
the night, I was fast asleep. So
 my mother said to the Gestap
o, SS guy, whoever he was, ﬁCan I 
leave my kid here? ﬂ  He says, ﬁYou can if you wa
nt to, but I™m not guara
nteeing that the train 
won™t take off without you.ﬂ So 
she woke me  up. I did not have 
to strip, but my parents did. And 
the amount of money that my father was allowed 
to take out, he had more on him than he was 
allowed to, he telegraphed that 
to his brother. [indecipherable] 
Q: Oh, he was able to -- 

A: Send --  

Q: -- to do that. 

A: -- to do that.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So we took out only what was legal. At this
 point my fat her didn™t want to me ss anything up 
for a few dollars. And then we went on the tr
ain to Genoa, and my mother™s sister, whose 
husband had been killed in the concentration cam
p earlier, was living in Milan. And she came  to 
say good-bye to us. And her train and our train 
came  together. I was walking through the train 
and all of a sudden there™s Tante 
Trude. I ran into her arms. And she came to Genoa with us and 
saw off -- saw us off fr om the pier. I can still 
see her waving to us as we were leaving.  
Q: And she felt okay staying in Italy? 
A: We ll, her s -- husband had been killed. 

Q: Killed, right. 

A: Her only child, her son, was in Engla
nd, so she eventually got to England. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
28 
 
Q: I see. 
A: By the time  te -- she got to England -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- he had ma naged to go to Palestine and join 
the British Brigade at Palestine. And eventually 
she joined him in Palestine. 

Q: [indecipherable] each place that she went. 

A: She was always -- she would -- 
she was telling us later on the ship was blacked out that  she 
took from England to go to Palestin
e. She went to Palestine legally. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: This was before the illegal -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- immi grations. But it was in mi ddle of th
e war. But she was there to see us off, and 
eventually we got to meet he
r -- meet up with her again. 
Q: Right, right. So how do you reme mber th
is ship trip, whic
h was really long? 
A: It was -- took about six weeks. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We ll, I have a tendency 
to get seasick very easily. 
Q: But you didn™t know that. 

A: I didn™t know that beforehand. But the Dutch 
liner was a luxury liner 
and they had special -- 
in the dining room the children were not allowed to
 eat with the parents and I hated that idea. So 
I was in a separate room w
ith the little kids, you know, th
e two and three years old -- 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
29 
 
A: -- and o -- me  at nine years old, I felt I wa
s big enough to do that, you know, to be with my 
parents. 

Q: Sure. 

A: I didn™t like that at all. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And you would still see land when I got seasic
k the first time. I don™t know whether that has 
to do with seasickness or just anxiety about be
ing left alone. But eventu
ally it got alright, had 
ping pong tables, I learned to 
count to 21 in -- in Dutch. 
Q: Did you? Had you played ping pong before? 

A: Yes, we -- 

Q: You had? 

A: We  had, so -- 

Q: So that was fun. 
A: That was a lot of fun. 
Q: We re there -- were there a lot of kids
?  We re there kids your age on this trip? 
A: Yes. 

Q: There were. 

A: Yeah, well, ma inly Dutch kids and my brot
her s -- kids, there was a big swimming pool and I 
didn™t know how to swim yet, but my brother did, 
and he enjoyed that a 
great deal. And I had a 
good time on the ship. 

Q: Now, there were two other coup
les, right? Mr. and Mrs. Ritter? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
30 
 
A: Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, and Mr
. and Mrs. Braun, Braun, and a 
Mr. Salinger. We  were nine 
people altogether. Mr. and Mrs. Braun were the pe
ople that we shared this apartment with in 
Germany -- in Liegnitz. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They had three children, theyhad left Germany before that. On
e went to Argentina, one went 
to Holland, and one went to England. 

Q: So they were older kids? 

A: They were older kids. Little
 older, not that mu ch older. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Teena -- late teenagers -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- I believe, or ma ybe early 
20™s, or -- I have no idea. And th
ey -- it was very tragic what 
happened to them, the -- we were in Shanghai for 
about a year when they got a telegram from 
Argentina that their son had committed suicide 
down there. Reason, of course I don™t know. 

Their other son who went to Ho
lland was caught up by the Nazis -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and disappeared. And their da
ughter survived in E
ngland, that™s who they
 went to after the 
war. The Ritters had two sons, the younger of wh
ich was my brother™s ag
e, the other one was a 
little bit ol der. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they had gone to Palestine before that, an
d they were in Palestine. The Ritters went -- 
went to them when the war was over. When we 
all left Shanghai they went to Palestine. Mr. 
Ritter had a heart attack on the 
ship the day it landed in Pale
stine. And whether he  got to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
31 
 
recognize his son or not, I don™t know, but his sons
 were able to see him before he died. Mr. 
Salinger is another inte
resting story. He was ma rried to 
a non-Jewish woman, they had a son. 
She would not go with him to Shanghai, so they
 divorced. The son was eventually drafted into 
the German army. When the war was over, he went back to her. 
Q: Really? 

A: And lived in what became East Germany. His  son survived also. 

Q: Right. That™s quite a story. 

A: But the f -- this group of nine people, once we
 got to Shanghai, we rented a house -- actually 
were some  more people, I mean -- it was the equiva
lent of a townhouse, and we all lived in there. 
Henry and I -- Hans became  Henry ba -- were the 
only children, so my fa mily had two rooms, all 
the others had one room. They had a 
joint kitchen, everybody cooked together. 
Q: Right. 

A: And eventually made that into
 a luncheon area for other people. But especially the Ritters saw 
their sons in my brother and I.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: As I started school in Sha
nghai they were alwa ys interested in how I did, and so on.  
Q: So they were sort of like another set of parent
s or at least some kind of
 relative in some  way? 
A: Yeah, well we were close to them -- 

Q: Close. 

A: -- I di dn™t consider them relatives, I thi
nk they considered us more their children -- 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- than we  considered them our parents. 

Q: So not so close with the Brauns? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
32 
 
A: Oh, just as close with the Brauns. 
Q: Just as close. 

A: Yes. And sal -- 

Q: And Salinger? 

A: -- sal -- al so -- 

Q: Also, so it -- 

A: -- wi -- wi -- also, was 
very cl -- very closely -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- knit group. 

Q: When you first arrived and saw Shanghai and sa
w this strange port with all these small boats, 
big boats, whatever, what -- what did you think?  Was it exciting to you? 

A: Exciting and scary both. 

Q: And scary, yeah. 
A: Everything was so strange. First of all, Shan
ghai, the waterfront is called the Bund, which 
prior to Wor l d War 
11
 had these giant, beautiful buildings, 
high rise buildings
 right around, they 
look very impressive. But then you saw these c
oolies, these are the workman. When they took 
the heavy stuff and carried it on bamboo sticks
, walking one ma n in front, one ma n behind on 
bamboo sticks, in a singsong voice so they kept th
eir tread going so they moved s moothly. This 
was weird to see. Then you saw the rickshaw
s, where a ma n actually pulling a little wagon all 
along the street. And then the poverty, the beggars 
on the street, crippled to some  degree, trying 
to beg stuff. And Mrs. Ritter had a si st er who 
was in Shanghai already, they actually we re there 
to welcome us. They said, well most of th
e refugees are movi ng into the Hongkew area. 
Hongkew was a part of Shanghai that had been de
vastated during the war between the Japanese 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
33 
 
and the Chinese. Many refugees, mo st refugeesended up there and started to rebuild the area. 
People were put into what was referred to ashomes. One room per fa mily, large rooms where 

people were living together. And everybody warned us
 against that, so this is where we didn™t 
want to go. So the first thing we
 did was go into a hotel on Bubbling We ll Road and stayed there 
for awhile, well I st ayed there while the a
dults we nt out shopping for a place to live. 
Q: Now is this where you played ﬁTroublesﬂ with the staff? 

A: This -- this is where --  

Q: And wha t  is that game? 

A: Well, it™s -- the German name for it is Mensch 
Ärgere dich Nicht. I™m not quite sure what it is 
called in England, but it™s a board game . 

Q: Right. 

A: And while they were going around, I sat down 
there in the hotel lobb
y, whoever wanted to 
play with me , played with me . I won every ga
me , I don™t know if it was purposely or not, but it 
kept me  busy, it kept me  from running around. But l
ooking at it back now, my parents left me  as 
a nine year old kid 
in a strange hotel. 
Q: Right. 

A: But nothing happened, I™ve ha -- I had fun, peopl
e enjoyed having a little
 kid there. And these 
were not necessarily Chinese, these were Ameri
cans, British, French, all kinds of people.  
Q: So is this in the in -- what th
ey call the International Settlement? 
Q: In the International Se ttleme nt, and the house 
that we -- they eventually found, belonging to 
another person, I don™t know if he was leasing it, 
or what, but we subleased the house, was in the 
French concession. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
34 
 
A: Rue Ratard. In French, everything was [ind
ecipherabl e]. And that™s where we eventually 
ended up. 
Q: Now yo -- did you stay in that hotel before they found the house, or were you able to run 

around the streets some? Did you go walk with your brother? 

A: I walked with my parents a little bit. 

Q: A little bit. Wa s -- 

A: I don™t reme mber too much of that. 

Q: You don™t? 

A: No. But it™s -- when I, 50 years later went back
 to revisit Shanghai, we stayed at a very fancy 
hotel in approxima tely the same  area. So I rec -- 

Q: As the ho -- as the house, the townhouse? 

A: As -- no, as the othe
r -- as the other hotel. 
Q: I see. 
A: It was on the same  street. That hotel wer -- I couldn™t find any more.  
Q: Right. 

A: The Burlington Hotel was the name of it, but
 I couldn™t find that. But there was this very 
fa ncy, modern hotel , which I believe was bu
ilt up in approximately the same area. 
Q: Sa me  place. Did you recognize the area wh
en you went?  Di d it look sim -- similar -- 

A: We ll, part of it, I did. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: My wife and I were -- went walking, I sai
d, ﬁYou know, down this str
eet, I believe is where 
my school used to be.ﬂ She said, ﬁWell let™s 
go.ﬂ So we walked down there, I said, ﬁIf I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
35 
 
reme mber correctly there was a big wall, a cem
ent wall around it, and behind the wall was a 
synagogue and this Jewish school.ﬂ 
Q: Really? 

A: And bingo, there it wa s. 

Q: It was.  

A: The school was now a governme nt building. We
 couldn™t go into it, but I recognized it. 
Q: My goodness. 

A: And the synagogue was there, it became sort of
 a museum, and we were able to go into it. 
And those things I recognized.  

Q: Wow. Okay, we have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Okay, just let me  go back a second, do you re
member when you got off the ship to go into 
Shanghai, did you get into trucks? 
A: Lot of people did, and they were transporte
d by trucks to the homes
 or other places in 
Hongkew. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I™m trying to reme mb er, I don™t know whethe
r we went by -- h-how we got to that hotel. I 
imagine we went by cab, but I couldn™t tell -- 

Q: Not by rickshaw? 

A: No, we used rickshaws later on, but I don™t belie
ve we took rickshaws to the hotel, however I 
-- my me mory fails me  on that one. 

Q: Do you reme mber what the mood of everybody 
was?  We re people very anxious?  Could you -
- 
A: No, I don™t think as a nine
 year old child I could -- 
Q: That you would -- yes. 
A: -- detect that. I know that we -- the ship 
docked on the other side of the river, you know, 
Shanghai is along a river, and we 
took like a little
 ferry boat -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- to the Custom House area where we cam
e in, and on that ferry boat, there was some body 
from the Jewish community, from Jewish committee 
in Shanghai who sort of clued us in a little 
bit. But what he clued us in is, he showed 
us the Garden bridge, the bridge going over the 
Suzhou creek on one side of which was the Intern
ational Settleme nt under 
British control and the 
other side was already under Japane
se control. And he told us th
at you have to walk across this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
37 
 
bridge, you can™t drive across it, 
that you have to show your pape
rs to the Japanese guard, and 
the Chinese people that are crossing there always 
had to take off their hat and bow down to the 
Japanese. And some body ma de s-some  re ma rk, well,
 what are we comi ng to here? It sounds as 
bad as what we™ve left behind. And that of cour
se, is where the homes were, that™s where the 
most refugees began to live. Bu
t we, some how or another didn™t 
go there. We ended up at this 
Burlington Hotel. 
Q: Right.  

A: And as I say, I don™t recall how we got there. 

Q: Do you reme mber being registered anywhere? 

A: No.  

Q: No, you just walked in? 

A: We just walked in. I bi -- I mean -- obvious
ly we had to register
 at the hotel, but -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- not regi ster ed as -- 
Q: But not at any formal -- 

A: Formal [i ndecipherable]. I imagine we di
d, but I don™t reme mber any [i ndecipherable] 
Q: So you don™t reme mber -- you didn™t ha
ve to carry pape
rs or anything? 
A: I didn™t. My parents had to -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- they had their German passports still, with 
the big J in it. And we as children were listed in 
that passport --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- we didn™t have our separate passport. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
38 
 
Q: You didn™t have your own. Ha -- do you reme mb
er how long you stayed in that hotel?  Wa s it 
a couple of weeks, was it -- 
A: It wasn™t too long. 

Q: A few da  -- it wasn™t too -- 

A: Be -- ma ybe a week or two. 

Q: Uh-huh. And then you moved to the French C
oncession, which was more 
south, closer to the 
harbor, I guess. Or not? 

A: No, actually not, no -- 

Q: No?  

A: -- it™s -- the French Concession stretched al
ong, you know, mi -might say it™s parallel to the 
International Settlement. The French Concession ha
d the nicer living quarter
s. Even today it st ill 
has -- 

Q: Yes. 
A: -- the nicer living quarters. And what I do reme
mber is like, the streetcars that could only go 
up to one point and then you had to take anothe
r streetcar on the other side. And there were 
trolley cars that were driven by electricity, but no
 tracks. So the electricity was different in the 
French area that it was in the in 
-- in the Internat ional Settlement. 
Q: Really? 

A: When they got there, one guy jumped off the 
car, they took a running 
start, pulled the wires 
down, ran across the street and th
en hooked the wires back up on th
e other side. And that™s how 
you got from one end to the other. It wasn™t too 
far away because from there I was able to walk 
to school. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
39 
 
A: And school was in the 
International Settleme nt. 
Q: It was in the Internat ional Settlement? 
A: It was a Jewish school. 

Q: Just called the Shanghai Jewi
sh school, is that where you went? 
A: The Shanghai Jewish school. 

Q: And did you go there fairly quickly fr
om whe n you ca -- you came in July -- 
A: No, we came in July of -- and they were overcrowded there, and I had a hard time  -- my 

parents had a hard time  getting us register
ed. Eventually we did, but by this time it wa s 
September, or October. I think 
it was after the Jewish holidays. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The principal, he was calle
d Reverend Brown. Course, was all 
British schooling, and my first 
day in school they had a dictati
on. I ac -- should go back a lit
tle bit to -- when I was being 
tutored in Liegnitz, I was also tutored in English. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So for about half the year I had some  Eng
lish lessons. And that was my whole experience in 
English. Now I come  into this class, it™s being 
taught in English, we have a dictation, where you 
write down everythi ng. The teacher knows I -- where 
I came from, so she corrected every word I 

mi sspelled, which was practically 
every word. You™ve never seen 
so muc h red ink on one piece 
of paper. But it didn™t take long. They put 
me  in a class a year younger than I was -- 
Q: They put you in second grade? 

A: I guess it was second grade, 
I had not -- I don™t even reme mber for sure what grade, they 
called it form, the British school. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
40 
 
A: Form. But I was -- I mean, the kids 
in class were a year younger than I. 
Q: I see. 
A: And after a year I cau
ght up enough to be put in
to my regular class.  
Q: And was everything 
taught in English?   
A: Everything was taught in English. But asa child, you pick this upvery quickly. The other 

children were help -- the teachers were helpful. 
Some  of the other kids were refugee kids that 
were there a little longer than I,
 they helped. I joined the Cub 
Scouts, right -- you know, about a 
year later. 

Q: And your brother was in the Boy Scouts? 

A: Boy Scouts, and -- 

Q: So your brother was in fifth 
grade, or sixth grade, some thing like -- whatever -- whatever the 
equivalent -- 

A: What -- I do -- I don™t reme mber what number -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- it was, but he was obviously
 four years ahead of me , howeve
r, he only went to school for 
about a year and a half. 

Q: And then he went to work. 

A: And then he was sent to work. 

Q: Right. So, are your parents 
learning English at all? 
A: Very little, very -- 

Q: Very little. So you™re speaking German at home? 

A: At ho -- home  we spoke German
, in school we  spoke English. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
41 
 
Q: Spoke English. And is there a common language in
 Shanghai or is just -- English just one of 
them because there™s so many languages? 
A: English was the ma in language that you we
re able to [indeciphe
rable] get along with. 
Obviously it™s Chinese, but even Chinese wasn™t 
[indecipherable] I mean, the Shanghai dialect is 

quite different from Mandarin, which is the ma in
 language of China today.
 My brother picked up 
Chinese -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- where he worked. I never did, other than 
a few words here and there, some  which you -- 

curse words you learn very easily in every language.
 But my parents lived 
within this Jewish -- 
German Jewish community. 

Q: In the French Concession. 

A: In the French Concession, we had [indecipherabl
e] contact with other pe
ople. My father tried 
to open a practice, he actually took an office fo
r about a year or so 
in the International 
Settlement. But the refugees as a rule did not 
come to hi m because they didn™t have any money, 

the Chinese didn™t come to him. He had recomm
e ndation to two -- to two physicians, and they 
were very nice to us, they helped my  father
 out, taught him somethi
ng about [indecipherable] 

diseases. But all in all my father was not able 
to ma ke a living from his practice. He tried all 
kinds of things. One time some body offered him a  j
ob in the leprosy colon
y, my mother put her 
foot down on that. She said, that we don™t need. 

Q: She thought he would catch it? 

A: Leprosy is -- you know, has a bad name  to it. 

Q: Bad reputation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
42 
 
A: Very bad reputation. And -- but one time some
body was looking for my father and I said, well 
he™s in that hospital over there. 
And I said well come  on, I™ll -- I™
ll take you there. And I took off 
with these two complete stranger
s to show them where my father
 was. My mother was horrified. 
You know, you hear about kidna
pping and all that kind 
of stuff. But I was perfectly at ease to do 
that. And we walked to school every day and 
I caught up fairly quickly with my class. 
Q: So what was your father doing? 

A: Sat around. 

Q: Sat around. 

A: Doing nothing. Became  very depressed. Eventu
ally these nine people 
decided to open up a 
little lunch room, you know?  Noon time  was the ma in
 meal that you ate in Europe. There were a 
lot of people there who didn™t know how to cook, 
pi -- single bachelors, what have you. They 
loved the lunch room, but inflati
on went -- was so rampant, that 
we didn™t ma ke any money. We  
basically paid for our own food. And my father
 acted like a maitre d™, you know, welcoming 
people, seating them, etcetera. In between he still 
practiced a little bit. My 
mother did most of the 
cooking. The other me n did the shopping, they used
 to go out and come  back on the rickshaw 
with all the food. There wasn™t muc h refrigerati
on there, so you had to buy the food the same  day 
that you were cooking it.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I don™t know for how ma ny y
ears that lasted, but it lasted 
for a little while. My mother 
also baked cakes for people. And 
what we loved is when one of 
the cakes didn™t come out right. 
Then -- 

Q: So you could have it. 

A: -- that was not good enough to sell, but -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
43 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- good enough for us to eat. 

Q: So she learned well enough 
from Marthe how to cook? 
A: She -- she learned -- she became an excellent cook. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But cooked everything in the German style. I mean -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- no Chinese food, per se. She took the Chinese vegetables, and some how or another -- 

Q: Made them into German. 

A: -- ma de it into Germa n food, which is, of course, what everybody loved. 

Q: Right. 

A: She also adj -- when -- once we got our furnitu
re, she got her sewing machine, and she started 
sewing for people. So she did -- whatev
er money we ma de, was ma de by her. 
Q: Right. So your father must have 
been really demoralized by this. 
A: Terribly demoralized. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the end result of that was that my br
other took on the job of being the head of the 
household. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He began to speak English, he began to speak some  Chinese. He was able to ma neuver 

throughout the city, and one of these doctors that
 my father was referred to knew a machinist 
from Switzerland, and he suggested the Henry might
 get a job with him, 
which he did. But this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
44 
 
place was at the other end of town. It was -- 
I don™t know how long it took him, but it took him 
about an hour by bicycle to get there. A
nd then he worked under the worst conditions. 
Q: Was thisAllensbach? 
A: Alle -- yes. 

Q: He wasn™t very nice to him either.  

A: He was not very nice to Henry -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and Henry has never forgiven my parents fo
r what they -- that they send him out like that. 
But they were desperate, my father especially 
was desperate. He didn™t see how things are going 
to go on, you know. How long is this war going to take? 

Q: Right. 

A: So at 14, he worked -- he started to work full time . 

Q: Right. Can I ask you, was this -- 
was this sort of typical of theproblems that the refugees had, 
that the male in the family, the -- the adult male 
was not able to earn a living and the kids had to 
go out, or wa -- do you -- 

A: It was not -- it was typical in some instances. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Doctors, lawyers -- lawyers had no way of -- 

Q: The professionals had nothing to do. 

A: -- pro -- professionals. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: If you were a shoema ker -- 

Q: You ha -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
45 
 
A: -- you did fine. 
Q: Right. 

A: If you did -- a watchmaker, you did fine. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Talking about watchmaker, there was a watc
hmaker who we became friendly with later on, 
Flautto, he actually ma de watches and clocks from
 scratch. And when Roosevelt got re-elected in 
1940, he send Roosevelt wa -- a little clock that he
 had ma de a s a present, and got a sec -- thank 
you note. I became friendly with his son years later. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So these are the people did very 
well, some  people opened up little shops. 
Q: Right. 

A: And also we must reme mber my father wa
s in this -- by this time 50 some  years old. 
Q: Right, right, he wasn™t a young person. 
A: He was not a young person any more. He tried to
 learn other trades, but that didn™t come  easy 
to him. He was often taken advantage of, and we
 didn™t trust the banks. So me  of the money we 
had was kept in either British pounds or American
 dollars, and then every time  you needed some , 
you changed it into China™s currency.  

Q: Right. 

A: You didn™t do that too much because the infla
tion was so tremendous. So my father one time  
went and got some  mone y in Chinese currency, on
 the Central Reserve Bank of China. He came  
home  with that and Henry said, ﬁDoctor, you go
t taken. Central Reserve Bank, that™s the bank of 
the Chinese puppet governme nt under the Japanese
 [indecipherable] govern
me nt. It™s not going 
to be worth much.ﬂ But shortly afterw
ards the Japanese took over China -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
46 
 
Q: And then it was worth more. 
A: And then it became  the currency to have. So
 where he thought he was 
taken he actually got 
ahead of everybody.  

Q: Now whe n you first came , the Japane
se controlled part 
of Hongkew, right? 
A: They controlled all of Hongkew, actually. 

Q: All of Hongkew. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And -- and the Interna
tional Settleme nt went up to a cert
ain point, but that 
was not taken over 
by the Japanese, nor was the fre -- the rest of Shanghai -- 

A: Was taken over on December eighth.  

Q: Yes, right.  

A: At that -- 

Q: In 1941. 
A: [indecipherable] in 1941. 
Q: Right. But so -- 

A: But up until that point it was st ill separate. 

Q: Right.  

A: Had this separate government, they had th
e French governme nt on one  area which was like a 
French colony and -- 

Q: And then the British. 

A: -- then the British were primarily in 
charge of the Internat ional Settlement. 

Q: Wa s there an American [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
47 
 
A: There was an amer -- American presence ther
e, too. There were American Marines at the -- 
they were actually stationed right across the stre
et from our s c hool. There were American Marine 
barracks.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then December seventh, which of cour
se, because of the International Dateline, 
December eighth in Shanghai, the Japanese took over
 the rest of the town, the -- both the French 

and the British -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- at the International Settlement. Even prior to
 that, the allies knew that
 they can™t stay there 
forever, so ma ny of the people living in Shanghai had already left back to the States, or France, 

wherever. Not France, because France was at wa
r already. And there were two British -- two 
gunboats left in the harbor, a British and an 
American. And the Japanese started bombarding 
them. And t he story goes that one surrende
red and one went down, ship and all.  
Q: Huh. Right. 

A: But these were -- these are st ories, I -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: -- I don™t know these to be facts.  

Q: Yeah, right.  

A: What I do know is that December eighth was 
a Monday and I walked to school like always. 
We had by this time mo ved out of this building 
that we were sharing 
with our friends, to 
someplace else, further away from the waterfront. 
We didn™t hear the firing, we didn™t hear the 
bombardme nt. And we rode to work, which was in
 the Japanese area. I went to school, and the 
kids, did you hear the bombardment , the Japa
nese are taking over. We
 got called into the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
48 
 
auditorium, the principal told us about Pearl Har
bor and that the Japanese at this mo ment are 
taking over the rest of the city. As he is sp
eaking, we hear troops ma rching by the school, 
Japanese troops were ma rching by, occupying the Ma
rine barracks across the street from us. And 
I still recall seeing the ja -- th
e American flag go down and the Japanese flag go up over the 
Marine barracks. And then they send us all home.
 By the time I ca -- came home, a kid a year or  
two younger than I had gotten home a few mi nutes befo
re me , he told my parents and his parents 
all kinds of stories, they couldn't ma ke heads or
 tails out of him, he was so nervous. I was the 
fi rst one to tell them about Pearl Harbor and the 
Japanese taking over. In this time  they worried 
sick about my brother. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And he pedaled all the way th
rough all this military takeover
 back home from where he was 
working. And after this my parent
s decided it™s time to move into
 Hongkew, into the area where 
all the refugees are living. 
Q: Right. But let™s go back a little bit. In the --
 when you™re living in th
e French Concession with 
these two couples and a single guy -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- then all of those people decide 
they™re going to go to Hongkew. Wa  -- 
A: They all decided to go to Hongkew and my
 mother still didn™t want to go to Hongkew. 

Q: Right. 

A: So they -- they -- 

Q: So you -- they left. 

A: -- moved to Hongkew and we moved in with 
another family into a small apartment.  
Q: Wa s that in kena -- ke -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
49 
 
A: Yes, it started with a K. 
Q: Ki -- ki -- K-i-n-e-a-r, Kin
ear. I don™t know how to pronounce it. 
A: Kinear Road. 

Q: Kinear Road. 

A: I think yes, Kinear Road. 

Q: Now, that was not in the French Concession. 

A: No, that was -- 

Q: That was -- 

A: -- in the International Settlement. 

Q: International Settleme nt. 

A: But further, I guess, to the west, away from the harbor. 

Q: Ha -- yes, and further away from H
ongkew, it wasn™t [indecipherable] Hongkew. 
A: Further away from Hongkew. 
A good ways away from Hongkew. 
Q: Now, during this period, are you 
walking around Shanghai by yourself? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You are, and it™s -- it™s -- 
it -- are your parents worried ab
out you, given there™s supposed to 
be a lot of thievery and opium 
dens and God knows what there. 

A: They mu st have been -- 

Q: But you went anyway. 

A: -- but I di -- I™m -- I™m not aware of it. I mea
n, they had no choice. I mean, I walked to school 
by myself, and some ti mes with friends. 

Q: Right. 

A: But we always -- it was always da
ytime, I didn™t walk around at night. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
50 
 
Q: At night. Did you see terrible things? 
A: Yes. The Chinese were very poor and very di
rty at that time. They 
had a child, an infant 
mi ght die, they didn™t bury it. They wrapped it in
 newspaper and put it out on the sidewalk. So I 
see this on the sidewalk, I cross over on the other si
de of the street, not to
 be close to it. I see 
that. I see someti mes dogs na 
-- around these infant corpses. 

Q: And could you see it was a corpse?  A baby 
corpse?  Because it wasn™t completely -- 

A: You could see that it was some thing covered. 

Q: Some thing, uh-huh. 

A: I hob -- I wasn™t curiou
s enough to go close to it. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: I knew what it was. 

Q: Right. 

A: You saw people who were crippled on the stre
et, begging, pushing a tin pl
ate in front of them. 
You saw kids crying while the parents were poking
 them so they cry more, trying to beg. You 
hear and heard and saw thievery going on. There wa
s the so-called hat-snatcher. You were sitting 
in the streetcar -- course, they were not air 
conditioned, was opened and the ma n had his hat on 
and just as the streetcar took o
ff, somebody snatched the hat off. 
Q: There was money in hats? 

A: There was money in everything. 

Q: I guess everything.  

A: There was a law in the Internationa l Settleme nt
, if some body steals a lo
af of bread and takes a 
bite out of it, he cannot be punishe
d, cause it shows that he wa s hungry.  
Q: Really? That™s interesting. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
51 
 
A: And we just try to be caref
ul, but the worst part was the di
seases. You couldn™t -- everything 
had to be boiled. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Wa ter had to be boiled, you could not eat a
ny raw food. Salads were basically out of the 

question. Some ti me s my  mother took some  salad 
and put -- poured boiling 
water over it, well, if 
you put boiling water over a salad, it
 doesn™t taste 
too good any more. 
Q: Right. 

A: The Chinese had little shops where they boi
led water and sold boiling water. And we would 
go there with a thermos, with tea leaves and a 
thermos, so get the boiling water, by the time we 
got home we had tea. 

Q: Tea, yeah. 

A: But they said, be sure you see the water boiling. It has to be bubbling. And that™s a -- these 

were big drums of water, so it took a long time for them to -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- really boil. 

Q: Right. 

A: The Chinese guy would like to sell it to you befo
re he -- it was really boiling. We were told to 
be careful about that. You couldn™t walk ba
refoot. When the rains came, Shanghai flooded. 
Shanghai was basically at or below sea level,
 so you had no baseme nts, no house had baseme nts 
like we™re used to over here. When it flooded, 
h-how did we get around? Took a rickshaw, and 
we talked to the rickshaw pullee what you™re goi
ng to pay him to go to wherever you want to go, 
and then in the mi ddle of the street he™d say 
no, I want more. He would 
just stop there, so you 
had to pay more to go on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

Q: But when it rained, it could be 
a foot of -- or more of water. 
A: Yes, it could -- i-it was fairly deep, 
I -- let™s say a foot or so at time s. 
Q: Did you have boots? 
A: Yes, but they were not big enough, so you ju
st had to watch what you™re doing, and -- this 
water was, of course, terribly filthy -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and you could get all kinds of diseases. 
And we went through all sorts of illnesses. 
Typhoid, cholera. We  got inoculat
ed every six months against al
l these different illnesses. 
Q: And whe r e would you get inoculated?  Woul
d the -- would the Jewish Joint have a -- 
A: We ll -- we ll, my father gave us the inoculation, I guess -- 

Q: He did? 

A: -- I don™t know where he got the stuff fr
om. But everybody got inoculated, the health 
departme nt inoculated people on th
e street, but we were told not to get that, because you don™t 
know how c l ean those needles are.  

Q: Oh boy, yeah. 

A: So you -- when you got inoculated, you got 
a certificate to show that you have been 

inoculat ed. But with all that 
going on, people 
st ill got ill. 
Q: Did you get ill durin
g this early period? 
A: Yes -- not the early period, I got ill -- 

Q: Later. 

A: -- later on. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The early period we did fairly well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

Q: Did you like being in shang -- I™m not -- talk
 -- bef -- before December eighth, se-seb -- 
before Pearl Harbor, did you like being 
there? Was it exciting, interesting? 
A: It was exciting, it was interes
ting, it was an adventure. Some ti
me s they had gangs that would 
gang up on you. Of course [indecipherable] like anyplace. 
Q: But this wasn™t because you were Jewish? 

A: No, this was because I was white. 

Q: I see. We re these Chinese or Japanese gangs? 

A: Chi -- chi -- Chinese. 

Q: Chinese gangs. 

A: Chinese. And then the Russians, the Russian ki
ds used to attack us, even in Hongkew later on. 
There was a lot of Russian people living there,
 and one time my father had a Russian person 
come  up with one of his kids to -- some thing 
was wrong with him and he took care of him. And 
he was in part -- h-he was in some  of these gangs
. So if he was in the gang they told them -- he 
told the gang to leave me al
one. I had my in with that. 

Q: I see. 

A: That™s -- that was always 
scary. You know, we didn™t have that much money on us, so if they 
want it, but -- 

Q: So they beat you up to try and get whatever money. 

A: Whatever money you had. You gave 
them some money then you ran away. 
Q: These were a lot of White Russians from Russia -- 

A: White Russians. 

Q: -- who came a fter the re
vol -- revolution, right? 
A: Yes. White Russians. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
54 
 
Q: Now, there are some  Jews in that population 
that came, but the ma jority who had came  over -- 
A: Yeah, there was a large Jewish Russian population. 
Q: Uh-huh, yeah. 

A: Very large. And some  of them we nt to schoo
l with us, in the Shanghai Jewish school. But -- 
Q: We  have -- 

A: -- we have to get -- 

Q: -- we have to change 
the tape [indecipherable] 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Hi. 
A: Hello. 

Q: Tell me  some thing. When -- when your brot
her Hans, or now Henry, was going to do work, 
was there a discussion or was he simply told 
by your father, you™re 
going to go out and -- to 

Allensbach factory and you
™re gonna -- do -- do you know? 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Basically speaking, I believe he 
was just told you have to go out
 there. I don™t think my father 
realized where he sent Henry to, and how bad it 
would be. I think my father should have checked 
it out instead of just taki
ng some body™s word for it. 
Q: Right. 

A: And sending this little kid, 14 years old, out
 to nowhere. And he di
dn™t do that, he didn™t 
check it out. You know, today if you send your
 son, or daughter, your child some place, you 
check it out, whether it™s a college, whether it™s
 a work situation. That, he didn™t do. They -- he 
was -- my fa ther was so panicked. He  didn™t know 
how he would feed his fa mily. Here he come s 
from a upper mi ddle class background as a physicia
n. He had his dreams of sending his sons to 
same  university he went to. Maybe
 they would go into his profe
ssion or some thing similar. All 
these dreams got shattered, and now 
he cannot even take care of th
em on a  day to day basis. He 
was worried how to feed us the next  day. What 
will ha ppen to us. So when this opportunity came 

around, he grabbed it and it™ll at 
least take care of us to some
 degree. Most of our quote unquote 
income  consisted of selling what we had. We  brought
 a lot of stuff along on this -- in this lift, 
and that™s what we lived on. It wasn™t until s
ubstantially later that we
 actually got charity.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
56 
 
Q: So when your brother is working, it doesn™t cont
ribute that much, because he™s not -- he™s not 
earning so much mone y? 
A: It doesn™t contribute -- i-it couldn't have co
ntributed that much. You know, I wasn™t in on how 
much he™s actually paying in. 

Q: Right. 

A: But, you know, prima r ily selling our products, my mother™s work -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- was the main income. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I still went to school. 

Q: Did Hans complain to you about the work at 
that -- at that time?  
Do you reme mber private 
conversations? 

A: Yes, I -- I think more later on than at that time
. I think I was too young to be
 privy to si -- this.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Henry -- I™ll call him Henry -- 

Q: All right, sure. 

A: -- because that™s the way I™m use d to it now
, is a very private person, doesn™t open up very 
much. And four years at 
that age is a long --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- is a big age difference. But while I ma de
 friends and had fun, in and out of school, he 
didn™t. He worked ma ny hours, he came  home dead 
tired, slept, back to wo
rk, and I wasn™t aware 
of what he was going through at the time.  

Q: And he worked six days a week? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
57 
 
A: Six days a week. 
Q: So he had -- he di
d have one day off. 
A: Yes. 

Q: But -- mm-hm. Did you -- even though he didn™
t say anything, did you realize it was hard on 
him in some  -- do you recall a 
thi -- or are you just -- 
A: No, I don™t -- 

Q: You were too young. 

A: -- I was too young. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. When di -- when did you join th
e Cub Scouts and he joined the Boy Scouts, was 
it -- 

A: Right -- almost within the fi
rst year that we were there. 
Q: Uh-huh. So did he stop when he was working?  He wasn't  part of it? 

A: He was -- he stopped. 
Q: He had to stop. 
A: He stopped. Yeah, he stopped and his education stopped, to a -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- great extent. 

Q: Right. 

A: I went to school for many more years and lot of
 things that I was learning in school he never 
was taught, obviously he™s se
lf taught since then. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I had a better education 
at that point. And -- but I wasn
™t -- to answer your question 
honestly, I wasn't  aware [inaudible] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
58 
 
Q: How was  the relationship with your parents at 
that time? You™re living 
in very close quarters, 
so you ma y not have even seen anything, cause at
 that age we often don™t see anything. But it 
must have -- 
A: You me a n the relationship between my parents? 

Q: Yes, was it diffit --  was it di ffi cult? 

A: It must have been very difficult. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But again, a nine ye
ar old doesn™t see that. 
Q: Right.  

A: I know my parents loved to pl
ay cards, especially my father, 
loved to play German card game  
called Skat, and I would set up my cot and go to 
sleep while they were playing cards. I mean, I 

could sleep thr -- I slep
t through all of that.  
Q: Right. 
A: And my parents, you know, pl
ayed with us, we played cards and car -- board game s and 
things like that. So we do -- did 
play together in that respect.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I th -- think I saw mo re of what my 
mother went through, cooking and sewing, baking. And 
again my fat her was devastated 
that his wife had to support th
e fa mily. And Henry was the ma n 
of the house, anything that came up to be discus
sed with the landlord, with this, with that. 
Q: He did it. 

A: He was involved in all these things.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That went on all the time  
that we were in Shanghai. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
59 
 
Q: We re you afraid your father would commit suicide? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You were? 

A: Yes, there was a time when we were living ou
t there on -- not Combare, what was the name  
of the street? 

Q: Kinear? 

A: Kinear Road. 

Q: Kinear. 

A: On Kinear Road, where I thought my father we
nt up on the roof to kill hims elf. M y father 
used to sit in a chair and fa
ll asleep in mi ddle of the da
y. Typical sign of depression.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that was one of the worst time for us, wh
en we were on Kinear Road, very far away from 
all our friends. And that is of
 course where we lived when the Japanese took over, and shortly 
after that we moved to Hongkew. Wh enever we 
moved, our apartment or room -- rooms, became 
smaller and smaller. My mother and I used ma ke
 a chart and figure out 
how we would set up the 
furniture in the new place, and sometimes it was within an inch -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- that we could squeeze some thing in, and what we couldn™t squeeze in, we sold. The move 

from Kinear Road into Hongkew was done on 
a push wagon, I mean it wasn™t a truck, a 
motorized truck , was hand pushed wagon a
ll through the whole ci
ty of Shanghai. 
Q: Cause it™s a big trip fr om Kinear Road into Hongkew. 

A: It™s a very large tr
ip. Th -- and then -- 
Q: We re these human be ings that are pushing the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
60 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- pulling the -- 

A: Pulling this cart. 

Q: This isn™t a rickshaw, it™s bi gger than a rickshaw. 

A: No, it™s -- it™s bigger than
 a rickshaw, it™s two guys pushing 
it. And I guess one of us must 
have walked along with them. Yeah, Henry walked along with them. Of c ourse it™s always Henry 

who had to do the dirty work. My mother and I we
nt ahead. We mi ght have
 taken the rickshaw, I 
don™t reme mber these things for f -- facts. So th
at when they came there, we were able to put 
everything -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- into the house. 

Q: And they would move -- these guys w
ould move the stuff into the apartment? 
A: Into the apartment and we put them where they
 are. What I do reme mb er is that I was also 
transferred to another school, from t he Shangha
i Jewish school, to the SJYA school, Shanghai 
Jewish Youth Association sc
hool, normally referred to 
as the Kadoorie School -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- because Sir Alec Ka doorie gave the money 
for that school. And you know, I was cutting up 
the last day in the other school. This one teacher 
didn™t believe that I would be moving, so he put 
me  on detention, and the next day when we were
 actually mo ving into the other apartment, he 
happened to walk by and said, ﬁOh, you really we
re moving.ﬂ And yeah, we were friendly after 
that. 

Q: Did you like the Kadoorie Sc
hool better than this -- the 
British system in the -- 
A: Well, they were both the British system. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
61 
 
Q: They were both the Br itish system. 
A: The Kadoorie School was on the British system as 
well. It took me  a little 
while to get used to 
the Kadoorie School, certain things were differe
nt, but not long and I was very familiar with 
everythi ng there.  

Q: We re there a lot of 
Jewish kids?  In the Kadoor
ie School is all Jewish? 
A: All Jewish. 

Q: [indecipherable] this a Jewish school? 

A: We ll, this is Jewish refugee school. 

Q: Uh-huh. As well as -- so was the other one. 

A: The other one was not just refugees, it™s a Jewish school, th-the Russian 
Jewish kids there, the 

British Jewish kids, these are the people fr om India, and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that settled sh -- in Sha
nghai initially. I mean, they were 
both Jewish schools, and in the 
Kadoorie School, the allied citizens ha d to wear ya
 -- armbands because the Japanese had already 
taken over. So you had the British or American ar
mbands and eventually these people were taken 
into POW camps, and only the refugee teachers rema ined. 

Q: And the refugee kids. 

A: And the refugee kids. 

Q: I see. 

A: There were basically none, ot
her than refugee kids in that
 school. Mrs. Hartwich was the 
principal. Mr . Gassenheimer was 
my teacher, and he wer -- these 
teachers were excellent. They 
had no textbooks to give us, so -- there were 
no textbooks so they had 
to teach out of one book, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
62 
 
we had to write everything down. But we learned so
 much. I  mean, I was not even 14 yet, this 
was 1941, I was 11 - 12. [indecipherable] 
Q: So this is before your Bar Mitzvah. 

A: Before my Bar Mitzvah. And we l
earned geometry, algebra, everything. 
Q: Mm. 

A: When ma ny years later I decided to take some
 night courses in Montgome ry College here, I 
took ma th and it was all a repeat, it was all what
 I had learned as a 12 year old kid. Gassenheimer 
was ex -- a fantastic teacher. They were trying to 
teach us so ma ny things all at one time. I me an, 
everything was taught in English, ev
en though they were refugee teac
hers, they were all taught in 
English. We  -- being a Jewish school, we had He
brew classes. Being in China, we had some  

Chinese classes. Being under Japane
se control, Japanese classes. 
Q: Japanese classes. 

A: And Mrs. Hartwich thought that
 we should also learn French. 
Now this wasn™t one year of 
this and one year of 
that, these were all -- 
Q: All together. 

A: -- taught simultaneously. The end 
result is that we didn™t lear
n anything to hold onto, a word 
here and a word there is all th
at I reme mber. English and German is what rema ined because we 
still spoke Ge rman at home. When we kids play
ed, it was a mi xture, we spoke both English and 
German interchangeably, but we had a good time as kids. There were no air raids -- 

Q: No?  

A: -- going on, none at all. We  didn™t have -- 

Q: That™s not until very late. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
63 
 
A: That™s -- that much later. That doesn™t come
 about until Okinawa fell. You hav -- year or so 
later I was Ba r Mitzvah and you had to pay tuitio
n at that school, and when my Bar Mitzvah 
came about, Mrs. Hartwich came up to my parents,
 we usually don™t give 
Bar Mitzvah presents, 
but we like Ernest -- I don™t know
 what they called me , er -- they
 didn™t call me  Ernie at that 
time. Anyhow, you don™t have to pay any more tuition. 
Q: So they had to pay before? 

A: Be -- we -- everybody had to pay, and th
is was my Bar Mitzvah present from --  
Q: That™s lovely. 

A: It was very lovely. 

Q: So you made a big impression. 

A: I obviously did very well. I -- 

Q: And you liked it. You liked it a lot. 

A: I -- I liked it. I was -- I mean, mat h was my fo
rte. I was considered th
e best ma th student in 
the school, not in the class, in the school. 

Q: In the school. 

A: We  were -- eventually kids dr
opped out as they went to work, so
 the last year there we were 
12 students in my class, six boys a
nd six girls. We  sat at a longtable, the girls on one side, the 
guys on the other, teacher at the head. And I wa
s the best ma th, it was a fellow by the name  of 

Hans Eberstark who was the best all around student. 
He -- he was -- is a genius. He eventually -- 
his hobby was to go to the library an
d learn the dictionary by heart. 
But he was also a lot of fun. 
He went along with everybody with their jokes. 
He eventually started working for the United 
Nations in Switzerland, and although 
I don™t know these for facts, as
 things I™ve heard, he helped 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
64 
 
write the Constitution for some of the new African nations, and as an interpreter for United 
Nations. We  also had theate
r that we put up in school. 

Q: We re you involved in that theater? 

A: I was involved in it. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I was in -- we did the part of Shakesp
eare, ﬁMidsummer Night™s Dream.ﬂ I was Puck -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- in ﬁMidsummer Night™s Dream.ﬂ We  also 
presented some thing in Japanese, where the 
Japanese paper came by and took a picture of us -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- sitting on the stage there. 
Course we learned it by heart, I 
have no idea what I was actually 
saying. The -- 

Q: But you were saying it in English? 
A: No, on -- 
Q: Shakespeare -- 

A: The Shakespeare in English. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, but the Japanese play was in Japanese. 

Q: Ah-ha, right. So they never 
told you what you were saying? 
A: We ll, they did, but -- 

Q: It didn™t -- 

A: -- it didn™t really ma tter that much. But we
 had -- the class had a gr
eat time , the 12 of us 
putting up these plays. We  were 13 - 14 years 
old. No, not quite 14. But we really had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
65 
 
wonderful time  there. And eventually my parent
s decided that I sh -- fi
nished that school as 
much -- far as I could go, that I should go to wo
rk. In the meantime my brother had -- was able to 
convince my parents at that pl ace where he 
was working was not right, and through some  
acquaintances he found another place, working 
for a Korean company that ma de lathe, and 
drilling machines and so on, where he was able to get a job for me . So I became an apprentice in 

this machine factory under my brother, in a wa
y. The factory had a small department where the -
- we ma de a ll the little parts, 
little screws, pins, what have you. 
And we were about half a dozen 
refugees working in there, in
cluding a Mr. Lawrence who was a 
forema n. And I worked there, 
and between my brother and I, we finally ma de 
a little bit more money than we were spending 
each day.  

Q: So how old are you then?  You -- 

A: 14. 

Q: F -- so this -- this is what, 
s-six or eight mont hs after your Ba
r Mitzvah?  No, yo -- it™s longer, 
it™s a year afterwards. 

A: A year afterwards. 

Q: This is 1943, before the announcement for the ghetto. 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: [indecipherable] the announcement of the ghetto was in 1943. 

Q: Right. 

A: The announcement of the ghetto ca
me  while I was still in school. 
Q: I see.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
66 
 
A: And I reme mber at that point, I mean we re
ad the announcement, we  read the borders that 
there were, and we thought -- I 
thought we were okay. We  were
 on the Seward Road, that™s 
where the line was. 
Q: Right. 

A: But the line went down the mi ddle of the street, and we were on the wrong side -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- of the street, and we  had to mo ve. We ll, one 
of the girl s that I was talking to about that , she 
thought they would have to move and she 
was on the correct side of the street. 

Q: On the correct side. 

A: So we had to move, and now to find a place to
 live was very difficult. See, in the ghetto, 
nobody had to move out. The Chinese people didn™t 
have to move out. You had to be in there 
within 90 days. Couldn™t -- it was very hard to
 find anything until the Jewish organization bought 
a part of a school and converted 
that school into small rooms and a few large halls. And you had 
to pay -- I forgot what they call 
it, key money or some thing like th
at, to be able to have one of 
these rooms. And my father had to
 sell his mi croscope so that he could have the money for us to 
move in there. So four of us moved i nto a room
 in the school. And it wa
s very short distance to 
the school for me  to walk there. The sc
hool was actually outside the district. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: However, the Japanese basically like 
kids and let us go to school. We  have -- 
Q: Did you have to get a pass to go? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you have to get it from t his guy, Ghoya? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
67 
 
Q: Was thatterrible? 
A: Well, it wasn™t so terrible as a kid because I-- I don™t think we ne -- actually needed it then, 

but when I went to work, where I worked was outside. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we had to get it from Ghoya, and that wa
s terrible because it had to be renewed every 
month, and some ti me s you stood in line for a mo
nth to get the renewal. So you stood outside 
there in every kind of weather, waiting for him 
to show up, then he showed up and gave a few 
renewals, gave a lot of rejections. Yeah, in su
mmer it was hot with the sun beating down on you, 
then you went inside and scare -- you were scared
, trying to get in front of this ma n who had 
such power over you. Initially some
 of the people decided not to 
follow -- not to move into the 
distri ct , so they were thrown into jail for 
a week. Didn™t think a week™s imprisonment was so 
bad, but these cells were infect
ed. They came out and died like flies once they came out. And 
that went on for the rest of the time. 
Q: Wa s Ghoya the ma in person that you had to ge
t -- wasn™t there some body else called Okura? 
A: Okura was actually
 Ghoya™s superior. 
Q: I see. 
A: But Okura wasn™t personally involved that mu ch with us. 

Q: But Ghoya was. 

A: Ghoya was, he had a refugee ma n being hi
s secretary, doing all the paperwork, but I don™t 
recall his name . But when Ghoya 
eventually got -- was out ofit, this ma n just did every 
[indecipherable] just took care of
 everyone. He was very fine pers
on. But Ghoya was terrible, it™s 
a -- Ghoya considered hims elf king of the Jews.  

Q: It -- this was his ow
n attribution for himself? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
68 
 
A: Yes. He thought he 
was doing us all a favor. 
Q: I see. 
A: Our sports activities were ma inly playing soc
cer and he used to come  out to the soccer field, 
where we had to parade past him, just like you 
parade past a king, and vi
ew hi m. And everything 
was fine and then the next morning for whatever
 reason, some thing he didn™t like, he threw the 

people in charge of the game  into jail for a few da ys. 

Q: Really? 

A: They never knew how he would a -- react on 
anything. He  used to hit people for no reason 
whatsoever. And again, the kids he ma inly 
left alone. I™m talking about the adults. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did you ever see that?  Di d you ever
 see him hitting some body [indecipherable] 
A: No, but my father got -- he said he got hit on 
the hand, just like this, and he said, ﬁI felt that 
for hours.ﬂ It was just [indecipherable]. And 
you know, the thing -- you were in such small 
quarters, everybody was on top of each other, sli
ghtest thing and people got into fights and 
arguments. The refugee communit -- 
community started their own -- wh
at did they call it?  Like a 
court system, so it didn™t have to go to the Japanese
 authorities. So you try to settle things outside 
of them. In t he meanti me, things got a little better
 for us because my fath
er got a job with the -- 
with the hi p -- not the hospital, but the 
-- well, with the hospital, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Was it the fr ee clinic? 

A: The free clinic -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- actually he got the job with the fr ee clinic. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
69 
 
A: And with him getting a job in the free clinic, my
 brother and I working, we finally were able 
to make ends meet. In the meanti me we had 
gotten onto charity. And before you could accept 
charity, they community send a committee up to 
your house, you know, places where you live, to 
ma ke sure you had nothing left to sell, which wa
s very demoralizing. But we got one hot meal a 
day, which was sort of a stew. My parents used to
 dig out the small pieces of meat there was, and 
gave it to Henry and I. My father lost over 50 pounds. 
Q: Really? 

A: Was -- basically bo
th of them were skin and b
ones, trying to keep us going. 
Q: And did you guys lose weight?  Did you 
lose a lot weight [indecipherable] 
A: No, us kids, we didn™t, but you know -- 

Q: We re you hungry? 

A: No. 

Q: You don™t reme mber being hungry? 
A: I -- I -- I was not hungry, my -- but my 
parents saw to it that I was not hungry. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Henry was not hungry. 

Q: And whe n the three of you were working, did 
your mother stop doing all this baking that she 

was doing, and sewing? 

A: Yeah, she actually stopped that
 when we mo ved into the -- 
Q: She did? 

A: -- into Hongkew, because she had 
no facilities there to do all that. 
Q: I see. 

A: So, I -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
70 
 
Q: But she still had her sewing machine?  Or not? 
A: She still had her sewing machine. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Oh -- to the very end. When we fi nally -- 
the war is over and we ma de contact with her 
brother in Ba ltimore, things happened very 
rapidly and she said, should I bring my sewing 
machine or not, and we -- it never got to [i
ndecipherable] anyhow, we 
sold it in Shanghai. 
Q: I see. 

A: And then she was sorry she didn™t bring it wi
th her. But -- was going to say some thing else. 

Q: We  were talking about [ind
ecipherable] meals and stuff. 
A: Oh, no I was going to ta -- at this 
time  is when I had my Ba r Mitzvah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Which was basically a low point 
in our life, as financial is c
oncerned. And my parents tried to 
ma ke the Ba r Mitzvah pretty nice. The cantor that we
 had used to be an opera singer in Europe. I 
can still see him, he looked like Pa
varotti standing there in front
 of me , singing to me . It was 
done very beautifully. Our nei
ghbors had a little haberdashery store and he came up to my 
mother a mo nth or so ahead of time to loan hi
m one of my shirts, he wants to ma ke one for 
some body, well he ma de a nice shirt for me . But what
 my mother had not realized, she gave him 
one that I™d -- I™d slightly outgrown. So the sl
eeves came up to here, and he had to attach 
some thing. That was my big present, was my shirt. 

Q: Your new shirt. 

A: And my Bar Mitzvah party consisted of coff
ee and cake. The rabbi came , my teacher came. 
And Gassenheimer was my teacher, the 
Hebrew teacher in our school -- 

Q: Was Gassenheimer? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
71 
 
A: No, was not Gassenheime r. 
Q: No. Right. 

A: Wa s a Mr. we -- We bber, I believe. He was 
teaching everybody but he was going into a lot of 
details. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: Gassenheimer was not so Orthodox. It was easier with him, and I took lessons from him and 

that went very well. 

Q: I think we  have to change the tapes. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
72 
 
Beginning of Tape Five 
Q: How long did it take you to
 learn your Haftorah and le
arn the ceremo ny for your Bar 
M i t z va h?  
A: Very short period of time . 

Q: Like what, a month? 

A: Two months ma ybe. 

Q: Really? 

A: Two th -- two, three mont
hs, something like that. But -- 

Q: So you were quick? 

A: Well, it wasn™t that so muc
h, my birthday isDecember second. 
Q: Right. 

A: So when I approached Mr. Gassenheimer back
 in August some ti me , he said, ﬁOh, December, 
we got plenty of time.ﬂ And first day back at sc
hool in sep -- early September, he calls me , he 
says, ﬁI just looked it up, your
 Bar Mitzvah by the Jewish ca
lendar is actually November 14
th
. 
We™re talking a lot sooner, we re
ally have to get onto it.ﬂ So we
 got onto it fairly rapidly. I don™t 
have a voice to sing, so I was just reading ever
ything, and did fine. Ever
ything went off pretty 
well, I did okay. 

Q: Ha -- you had learned Hebrew before, so -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- you knew -- 

A: I mean, I had ler -- started to
 learn Hebrew back in Germany. 
Q: Right, in Germany, right.  

A: I could read Hebrew, couldn™t speak it as a language -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
73 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- but, you know, I could read the Hebrew pr
ayer books, and knew some  of the translations, 
but basically just reading 
it was no problem for me.  
Q: Did you have to give some  sort of a speech, 
which is what they do in this country, I don™t 
know whether they do -- 

A: No, I didn't -- 

Q: No?  

A: -- I didn™t do any speech. 

Q: [indecipherable] speeches. 

A: No. 

Q: So where did it occur? 

A: In the school. 

Q: In the school. 
A: The school is where 
we also had services. 
Q: Right. 
A: In the ma in school auditorium, that™s where 
we had services, we had youth services there to, 
where the kids from school did all the part
s and I one time was the quote unquote rabbi -- 
Q: Oh yes? 

A: -- had a little talk on the subj
ect, the Torah subject of the da
y. So that™s where it wa s held. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, it was very nice, and -- 

Q: And where was the coffee and the -- 

A: At -- at our home. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
74 
 
Q: At the ho -- at the si  
-- in this little room?  
A: That™s --  in that  little apartment. 
This was before we move d into the SACRA -- 
Q: Uh-huh, I see. 
A: -- this was when we were on East Seward Road. 

Q: Right. 

A: -- so we actually had two rooms. 

Q: Uh-huh, so it was bigger. 

A: Bigger, and you know, we didn™t have that ma
ny people, ma ybe half a dozen people that 
came over.  

Q: And did you drink coffee, or wa
s there some thing else for kids? 
A: Oh it -- I did drink coffee, but it pr
obably was milk, or 
something like that. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: Don™t reme mber that much. 
Q: Besides the communal lunches you were getting for nothing. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And you were going to the -- 

A: The communal lunches really came about late
r, when we were in the SACRA building. 
Q: Right, but when you were in
 East Seward, you were not. 
A: We were not. 

Q: So what -- all of this time , what -- what 
are you eating? Are you eating three meals a day, or 
would you not even call 
it three meals a day? 
A: Yes, we were eating three meals a day -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
75 
 
A: -- and usually the noon 
meal was the main meal. 
Q: Right. 
A: I mean, we didn™t have cer
eal, per se, that  I recall. 
Q: So what was breakfast like? 

A: It was a light breakfast, some  bread a
nd butter and jelly, what
 have you. And I -- 
Q: And did your mother have to -- she had to buy food every day. 

A: She went to buy food daily -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- because of there 
wa s no refrigeration. 
Q: Right. 

A: And she ma naged ve ry well to do that. 

Q: And at night it was also very small. 

A: Very sma ll, like a little s
upper. But I can™t honestly
 tell you what we were eating. I™m -- the 
only thing I reme mber is that my mot her made -- you know -- 

Q: She baked. 

A: -- she did -- changed everything into Germ
an cooking. You know, people hear that I was 
living in Shanghai, they think of me  eating Chin
ese food. No, we didn™t do that, we ate German 
food. Many of the things we never heard of 
before. Some  of it came through the Russians, 
there™s kasha. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I reme mb er that, and I hated it. But that -- 

Q: You hated it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
76 
 
A: I hated it, I won™t touch it now. But kasha wa
s our cereal, and that was served to us. And 
other things, for example , Passover came  about, th
e rabbi announced this pa
rticular cereal type 
of food is good for Passover, for those people who were Orthodox. 
Q: Right. 

A: Made up our own rules. Kasha, there was -- we dr
ank a lot of tea, ate a 
dra -- ate a lot of rice, 
and for a long time after I came to the United States
, I hardly touched tea or
 rice. Since then I™ve 
been accustomed to it more. 

Q: Did you ever eat Chinese food in Shanghai? 

A: Yes, when -- when we had got our visa to come  to the States, we went out to a quote unquote 

Chinese restaurant. 

Q: Really? That was the fi rst time? 

A: A nice Chinese pl ace. Not the first time, it -- bu
t I rememb er that  time because we -- we ri -- 
Q: Wa s it good?  Did you like it? 
A: Yeah, we liked it. One time earlier, one of thes
e doctors that my father had been refe rred to, 
took us to a really fancy Chinese restaurant wi
th several courses came in -- comi ng in. But I was 
very little at  that time, I 
didn™t appreciate all of it, 
but it rel -- it can be nice. 
Q: Right. 

A: But most of the time it was make do with what was available. 

Q: Right. It wasn™t an easy time, was it? 

A: No, it was not. I -- I mean, again, as a child 
you don™t know these things
, but for my parents it 
must have been terrible, not knowing how 
they™re going to feed us the next day. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
77 
 
A: How are they going to pay for the food?  
And tha -- you know, once we moved into the 
SACRA, it™s there that we applied and eventu
ally got charity. And 
I reme mber the people 
comi ng in, looking over to see -- 

Q: To ma ke sure that 
you had nothing to sell. 
A: To ma ke sure there wa s nothing to sell. And 
then we got this one hot meal a day, which was 
big pot of stew. 

Q: And did they bring that to your 
apartment, or did you have to go -- 
A: We ll, they brought it in 
a cart, and then they -- 

Q: And they™d ladled it. 

A: Ladled it out. And we had 
a pot they ladled it in -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- and then my parents tried to gi
ve us as muc h meat as possible. 
Q: And the other two meals 
they had to be responsible for getting them to you? 
A: Yes. And one was some  sort of kasha or whatever that was. 

Q: So what did you drink in the course of the da
y, because it had to be extremely hot at certain 

times of the year, right?  I mean, you w
ould need to drink a lot, right? 
A: We need to drink a lo
t, we drank hot water. 
Q: You drank hot water. 

A: Because when we we nt to work, my brother 
and I went to work, and our mother took -- ma de 
some  sandwich for us, but we couldn™t take anyt
hing to drink with us, and whatever we drank 
had to be boiled. So we had to see that it is 
boiled, and then we drank hot water. Hot water and 
sort of dry bread was our lunch.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
78 
 
Q: But what happens with the communal meal, if the communal meal is the mi ddle of the day, 
and the two of you were working, what happens? 

A: My parents kept it for the 
evening, and then reheat it. 
Q: So you -- you would have it in the evening. 
And did your father wo
rk all day long once you 
got into -- 

A: No, it was a while before he -- 

Q: Awhile before -- 

A: -- got that. 

Q: So you were working with your br
other before your father got to -- 

A: Oh yes, and my father was still practice once 
in awhile, and then ever
ybody had to leave that 
one room that we lived in when he had a patient in there. 

Q: I see. 

A: Other times when it wa sn™t such a personal ex
amination, I assisted him in some  things. We  
had like a little balc -- not a 
balcony, like a walk around the roomoutside where we fired up the, 
what we called the Chinese oven, which was a hi
bach -- hibachi. Over here when we do the 
hibachi it™s a lot of fun, over th
ere, that was the way to go. Had to buy charcoal to do it, and 
when charcoal became too expensive, we bought 
powdered coal, which we mi xed with water, 
and ma de into little coal balls to 
heat up. Our hands were black as -- 
Q: Black. 

A: -- oh, it was terrible. And th
ere was one woma n in -- w-we were quite a few people in this 
building, couldn™t tell you the qua
ntity. The one woma n wor ked in a restaurant. She used to 

come home and bring the coffee grounds from 
the restaurant. Anybody has a fire going, you can 
-- they can share with me  a cup of coffee. So 
my mother had -- loved coffee, she mi ssed coffee 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
79 
 
more than anything else. So she had the fire
 going and drank the coffee when it was going 
through the grounds a second time. And it™s -- and there also were
 -- we got bombed out. In 19 -- 
Q: But that™s later -- 

A: That™s later, okay -- 

Q: -- let -- let -- let me just ask you a couple of
 things. Now, did I just forget my question. 
A: We ™re talking about food, and -- we™re talking 
about the communal kitchen stuff that came in. 
Q: Ah, this is what I wanted to know. Does 
your -- does your fa ther™s mood, as you see it now, 
get better when he starts to work and the th
ree of you are working?  Do you see a difference? 
A: When my father got the job in 
the clinic, his mood began to change. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: His mood began to change, and ma de all th
e difference in the world then. And I reme mber, 
you know, you couldn™t deal in Amer
ican currency on -- on open ma rket, but Chinese currency 
had no value. So when we finally were ableto come  to a point where we could buy some  
American dollars, it was a big point  because th
at was a turning point. This month we actually 
ma de more than we spent. 
Q: I see, because it was worth more. 

A: It was [indecipherable] we were able to buy so me  dollars on the black ma rket, and that™s what 

we put aside. 

Q: Now, before you meet -- they don™t actually 
call it a ghetto, they say 
the designated area for 
stateless refugees, right? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: So it™s actually for all of you who 
would come  after ™37, am I correct? 
A: Correct. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
80 
 
Q: So it™s ma inly Austrian and German refugee s . 
A: Correct. 

Q: Oh -- as well -- and y -- 

A: Some  Polish also.  

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t know ho -- the Polish -- 
w-we -- they were in there, but it™s primarily the German and 
Austrian refugees. 

Q: Right. Before you go in there, there™s a lot going on in Europe. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: A lot of murdering of Jews. 

A: We  didn™t know that. 

Q: Di -- you didn™t know, you hear nothing. 

A: We  know that they are being 
put into concentration camps. 
Q: Right. 

A: My grandmother, my  mother™s mother was sti
ll in Breslau. She was up in age when we were 
getting ready to leave, 
and my aunt, who was quite wealthy, ha
d paid in an old age home  for the 
rest of her life, so she didn™t ha
ve to worry about money. My moth
er asked her to come  with us 
to Shanghai, she said, ﬁLook, you guys going to have
 a hard time in Shanghai, why should I be 
along?  Who would do anything to a -- an old wo
ma n like me . I™m taken care of over here.ﬂ So 
we corresponded with my grandmother all the tim
e we were there, and one time a letter comes 
back, moved, address unknown. And we knew th
at meant concentration camp. And I recall 
seeing my mother in tears when she got that. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
81 
 
A: When we  got that notificati
on. Now, what concentration camp 
meant, that it was death camps, 
we were unaware of. As it turned out, my gra
ndmother was taken to Theresienstadt, and from 
what we understand, she died there.  
Q: Do you think that your parents 
knew more than you and Hans knew? 
A: No, I don™t. 

Q: You don™t? 

A: I don™t think. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I don™t think anybody knew this.  

Q: Right. So people didn™t have radi
os, they didn™t have a way of -- 
A: We ll we had radios. 

Q: You did. But you couldn™t get -- you -- you couldn™t go far enough to get -- 

A: But the radios didn™t announce it. 
Q: Yes. 
A: The Russian radio had a German program on 
it. See, Russia was not at war with Japan. 
Q: Right. 

A: So the Russians were free, and the Russian
s reported ve ry accurately what went on on the 
European frontier. Now, we heard, you know, about
 the landing in Norma ndy and all that, almost 
at the same  time as you would have heard over 
here. But we didn™t hear anything about the 
Japanese war. 

Q: I see. 

A: And one time we -- it came through about Okinawa and we looked on a ma p and we saw 

where Okinawa was, and we said to ourselves, G
od, that isn™t so far away from us any more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
82 
 
And then shortly after that, that bombing off Sh
a nghai began. So once a island like Okinawa, 
comparatively close to the Chinese mainland, was cap
tured, planes flew from
 there, and did their 
mi ssions from there. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But most of the bombing of Sh
anghai occurred in the outskirts. 
Q: Right. Do you think any -- do you think that the ma
jority of refugees, the 
stateless refugees in 
Hongkew knew nothing? 

A: Of the death camps?  I don™t believe they did. 

Q: Until after the war. 

A: Until after the war. 

Q: Right. W-When you s a w the notice, or all of you 
saw the notice to go into the designated area, 
which was February ™43, and you 
have to be in there by May. 
A: May. 
Q: Am I correct? 
A: February 18
th
 -- May 18
th
. 
Q: February 18 -- yes. Were you worried about ha
ving to go in there, or did you think that the 

Japanese wouldn™t do anyth -- I m
ean what -- what -- what was th
e sensation about the Japanese? 
A: We ll, we were worried. I mean, the Japanese 
were in control there, and Germans were thei r 
buddy buddies.  

Q: Right. 

A: We  had no idea what was going on in Germany, but
 we realized this is an imprisonment of 

sorts. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
83 
 
A: And only of sorts, because usually when you are a prisoner, they feed you. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Here we had to feed ourselves. 

Q: Selves, right. 

A: And, you know, primarily, the first thing 
is trying to find th
e place to live. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean, just imagine yourself at -- you decide 
to move and you have 90 days to do it. So it -- 

it™s not easy to find a place under 
the best of circumstances, and 
here, all of a sudden, all these 
people trying to move in. Many people switched 
home s with the Chinese. They took their fancy 
house, some thing like as nice as th
is one and traded
 it for a hovel. 
Q: So there were some  people who did very 
well in Shanghai, as 
far as you can tell? 
A: You me a n among the  refugees? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Very well is exaggerating it a bit. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: They did well. They ma de more money than 
they spent. That™s considered doing well. There 

were some  -- there was one fa mily from Liegnitz
, one -- a couple actually, 
they didn™t have any 
children. They came with their pare
nts. And his father was not Jewi
sh, so he didn™t have to move 
into the ghetto. The younger coupl
e got a little place in th
e ghetto, but they were all 
watchmakers. His father employed him, and he was 
able to work with his father and live outside 
the ghetto. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
84 
 
A: They did work quite well. This
 Mr. Schwartz who lived next door
 to us, he the one that ma de 
the shirt for me , he had a  store across the street
, and he seemed to do all right. And a lot of the 
people who were handyme n, plumbers, electrician
s, what have you, they did fairly we ll. 
Q: But they™r e working with the Je wish refugees
, right, who don™t seem to
 have a lot of money. 
So how are these other people, even though they 
have the skills, how were they ma king money?  
Do you understand it? 
A: Well, we all had a little bit of
 money s -- comi ng from somewhere. 
Q: Uh-huh. Some where. 

A: I mean, you had to have a plumber, you needed a plumber. 

Q: Right, right.  

A: I am not sure how these things -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- all came together again. You couldn™t see that. 
Q: And who did you rent from?  Whe n
 you rented this little room. 
A: Well the room in the SACRA was 
of course, the SACRA organization. 
Q: Right. 

A: It stood for something.  

Q: Right. 

A: Shanghai soma  -- some thing or another. Prior to that, a Chinese ow-owned the house. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the -- 

Q: In Seward, when you were in east -- 

A: On East Seward Road. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
85 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: And he had a sh-shop downstairs and rented 
out the upstairs. And once the war was over, and 
we moved back a block away on East Seward 
Road, the same  thing occurred. Some body had a s-
store downstairs and rented out the upstairs. 

Q: All right, let me  
ask you about hygiene. 
A: Yes? 

Q: You probably didn™t have a toilet inside. 

A: Yeah, we did. 

Q: You did? 

A: We  did have -- 

Q: Throughout? 

A: Throughout, that™s one thing we
 insisted on, WC in the -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- meaning water closet, yes. 
Q: So that™s unusual? 

A: We ll, it wasn™t too unusual, but
 it wasn™t unusual not to have
 it. But we  had it, we did not 
have to have an outhouse. 

Q: So you didn™t have to have one of 
these what they cal
led the honey buckets? 
A: Nope, we didn™t have 
to have a honey bucket. 
Q: I see. 

A: Thank God. 

Q: Wa - Was that the ma in given by the refugees, a honey bucket? 

A: I would imagine so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
86 
 
Q: You i magine so. Because that, I™m sure, was very uncomfortable. 
A: We ll, but, you know, when we wa lked to work, or walked to school -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- we would see these Chinese peopl
e cleaning out their honey buckets -- 
Q: Buckets. 

A: -- in the mi ddle of the street. 

Q: And there would be people who would come , and you would dump t he -- 

A: They du -- come  in one of these carts, they 
would dump it in, and then they would take it out 
in the fi el d and use it as fertilizer. 

Q: As fertilizer. 

A: That™s another reason why you had such -- 

Q: So did Shanghai stink? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Was it a lot of s -- awful smells? 
A: Awful s mells, especially -- yeah. Not in th
e Fr ench Concession, yeah, the fancy residential 
area, but in the Hongkew area, it stank. I mean lit
erally, it was terrible. And the people on the 
boats, they threw their waste into the water. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now that™s the same water th
at then came out of your faucet. 
Q: So that™s why you had to boil it. 

A: Yeah, boil it. 

Q: And even boiling, I would imag
ine, didn™t clean everything. 
A: Well, they well -- that did 
go through some  cleansing pro --

Q: I see. 
A: -- process before it got there, but the ba
cteria of course, all 
came straight through. 
Q: Right. 

A: And sometimes people thought that
 certain filters would help it or
 -- they tried it and they -- 
Q: It didn™t. 

A: It didn™t. And we got all ki
nds of illnesses. Typhoid, typhus. 
Q: Did your parents ever get sick? 

A: Oh yeah. My parents got
 sick, I got very sick.  
Q: You got very sick at the end.  

A: I had [indecipherable] 

Q: And so did your brother -- 

A: -- war was actually over. 

Q: -- right? 
A: My brother got sick -- 
Q: Some thing -- 

A: -- he had got sick -- 

Q: Bacterial dysentery or something like that? 

A: Bacterial dysentery in there at
 one point. But wa -- I -- I had e
ither typhus or typhoid, I never 
can keep it st raight, whatever come s from lice. 

Q: And your parents? 

A: My father had some  bacterial disease, my 
mo ther had some thing else. Everybody got sick all 
the time . 

Q: And so they got sick, and then they
 got over it and then they got sick. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
88 
 
A: Sick, and over it. Some  things 
were not so serious as others. 
Q: Let me  a sk you this, when you look back -- I™m su
re at this age you wouldn™t have seen it, but 
when you look back and think about when you move
 into the designated 
area, wh-where people 
are now calling the ghetto. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Maybe you ca -- did you 
call it the ghetto then? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You did. 

A: But -- yeah, I -- yeah. 

Q: So your mother stops doing cer 
-- the things that she was doing because all the boys in the 
fa mily, the me n are working, right? 

A: We ll, the -- yeah, bo -- my fa
ther didn™t start working until -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- some time after that. 
Q: But at a certai
n point he does. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And she stops. Now do you -- 

A: She di -- she did -- she continued doing -- 

Q: Oh, she did? 

A: -- something. I mean, we didn -- we 
didn™t have the lunchroom any mo re. 

Q: Right. 

A: That stopped when we moved away from rue Ra
tard. I think she still di
d some  of t he sewing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
89 
 
Q: Okay, then my question is not -- I™ll tell
 you what I was going to ask you. I thought that 
possibly she pulled back from all 
these things so that your fa th
er could feel even s -- even 
stronger, but ma ybe -- 
A: No, you know, that was not the case. 

Q: No. 

A: I™m not sure at this point how the m
oney that we needed to have came about. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: Mostly it came about from selling things. My 
fa ther™s mi croscope, my mother™s fur coat, and 

this, that, the other. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: [indecipherable] more and more. 

Q: Did you hate going to work? 

A: No. 
Q: You didn™t resent it? 
A: No. I looked forward to it, you know. 

Q: Really? 

A: You get out of school, you get to wor
k, I can do someth -- accomplish something. 
Q: But you loved school. 

A: I loved school, and I -- 

Q: And you loved the work? 

A: -- I basically loved work, but I was an apprenti
ce, I didn™t like it when they had me  cleaning 
up. 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
90 
 
A: I wanted to get onto the machin
ery, learn how to use the machinery. 
Q: Right. 
A: The Korean who owned the company, he didn™t
 want to see me  on the machinery, he wanted 

me  to clean here, clean there. 

Q: Clean -- 

A: This department where we made all the small parts was sort of a showplace for hi m.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And he often brought his customers in to see -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- what we  were doing. And I loved ma king m
oney. There -- after awhile -- I mean, first we 
got paid a salary, but then we got on piecewor
k, where for every screw you got so and so ma ny 
cents, or whatever it was. 

Q: Right. 
A: And I loved that, I loved being able 
to contribute, and ma king the mone y. An -- 
Q: W- Woul d yo -- 
A: A -- but you know, I was still 
14 - 15 years of age, of -- 
Q: Your brother by then is 19. 

A: 19 -- 18 - 19 years old -- 

Q: 19 years old. 

A: -- and trying to protect me  from everything, I 
mean, when they told 
some  stories that he 
thought I was too young to hear, I 
-- you know, go fetch a glass of 
water kind of thing, which I 
resented, I th-thought I was big enough to hear -- hear all this. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
91 
 
A: But we also had shelters, bomb shelters in th
e back of the -- of the factory. However, when 
the bombing started we went on the roof of th
is factory and watched the American bombs -- 
bombers bomb the outskirts of th
e city. I reme mber the first tim
e we saw the B29™s flying over 
our head. They were flying so high that the Japa
nese anti-aircraft couldn
™t reach them. So we 
were there just looking up at them. 

Q: Just looking up. As I understand it, the Ja pane
se had sort of munition du -- places in Hongkew 
-- 

A: Well -- 

Q: -- or around, nearby. 

A: Where they had it all, I don™t know. But the school that we -- the SACRA built into this 

building, the other half was a radio station. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A Japanese radio stat ion that gave some  ja 
-- radio signals to the militar y. And there was a -- a 
gasoline place, storage pl ace not fa
r away. And there were other things, there was an admi ral of 
some  sort not living too fa r. 

Q: Mm. 

A: So when on July 17
th
, 1945, a blanket of bombs was placed 
over that whole area. They were 
obviously not very large bombs, not like these big bo
mbs that they used to destroy a lot of things, 
but there were about three or four bombs that 
fell into our building. And quite a few people got 
killed right then and there. I was home, I didn™t go
 to work because I had a cold, flu or whatever, 
nothing serious, but I wa s in bed. As  I said befo
re, we didn™t have any baseme nt, there was no 

place to go anyhow whe n the bombs  fell and they 
were usually [indecipherable] on the outside . 
All of a sudden I heard this big noise and I 
see the ceiling falling down 
on me  like that. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
92 
 
went like this. There was a bookcase over my boo
k, and one foot fell above my head, a nd one 
below my fe et, and the whole ceiling and everything 
fell on top of that, so 
I hardly had a scratch. 
But I came very close. 
Q: Let m -- there were bookcases on it -- 

A: It was bookcase, you know, a bookshelf with two legs. 

Q: Right. 

A: Or a leg on each side. 

Q: On either side of the bed. 

A: On either side of the bookshelf, that was over the bed. 

Q: Uh-huh. Right. 

A: And one part of that shelf fell above my head -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- one below my feet. And it protected me  fr
om the ceiling and everything else that came 
down. 

Q: Right. 

A: My parents were just outside 
the door where I guess there was a 
stronger part of the building -
- 

Q: And they were okay. 

A: -- and they were not hurt, they were okay. 
But my mother was scared for me, couldn™t open 
the door because of the air pressure. And then 
when they finally opened the door and called for 
me , and they said I didn™t answer right away, be
cause all they saw was the ceiling stuff all over. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: And my brother was at work, 
and -- I guess we have to stop. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
93 
 
Q: We ™ll s -- we™ll stop and then continue the story. 
End of Tape Five

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Ernie, you were talking about
 the bombing and your parents -- 
A: My parents were outside -- 
Q: Outside. 

A: -- and the building there, it was a brick build
ing and a fairly sturdy building, so where they 
stood wer -- did not come  down, th
e ceiling did not come  down. A
nd my  mother at first thought 
that there™s some body lying in fr
ont of our door that she coul
dn™t open it, because the air 
pressure was so strong fr om the bombs falling. Bu
t finally she was able to open it, and after a 

few seconds, actually, I guess, I was able to ye
ll I™m here, and push stuff away from me and 
jumped out into their arms . No sooner was that done
 than a call came fr om my father to help here 

and help there because there were -- a lot of pe
ople were wounded, and quite few had died. But 
my brother was at work, and some body was tellin
g him at the wor -- and he decided to come  
home  when he realized where 
the bombing had occurred. So he started running home, it was a 
good 45 mi nute walk. And on the way he me t people,
 he said -- he asked, what about the 
SACRA building, and people just, oh, everybody got 
killed in the SACRA bu
ilding. It was not til 
he was about a block or two away that he me
t some body who knew us, and he said, don™t worry, 

your -- your fa mily is fine. Now, I still had a temp
erature from the flu or 
whatever I had, so I was 
lying outside on a rug, trying to stay calm. And 
my mother was with me  when he came . We 
couldn't find my father, he was being called from 
one end to the other. And then they said, well 
we all have to move into this 
school.And my mother said,I don™
t want to move into the school 
with all these people. So we cl
eaned up our room a little bit -- 

Q: And stayed there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
95 
 
A: -- and st ayed there for the first night. You could see the st ars comi ng through the ceiling. And 
during the night a fire broke up some where in th
is complex, was actually two buildings. Well, 
the next morning we all decided we better move
 into the school. So 
we grabbed -- each one 
grabbed a ma ttress and walked those three bloc
ks to the school. The classrooms were ma de 
empty, and you put one ma ttress next to the ot
her, ma n, woman, child. And that™s where we 
stayed. But neither Henry nor I decided to go ba
ck to work. We refused to go back to work. 
Q: You refused? 

A: We  were too scared. And this was July 17
th
. Shortly afterwards the wa r was over. The way we 
found out the war was over, on August 10
th
 is my mother™s birthday. We  woke up in the 
morning, we heard bombs falling. My father said
, here™s some -- they™re sa luting you to your 
birthday. And then at night, wi -- what was al
ways black out, all of a 
sudden the lights went on. 
There™s Mr s. Hartwich, the princi
pal in her nightgown. I just h
eard over the shortwave that the 
Japanese have asked for surrender. The war 
is over. And everybody got out, went into the 
auditorium, some body j u mped at the piano, and st
arted playing music. A
nd my father led the 
conga line. 

Q: Really? 

A: Dancing through there. Next mor ning people 
started tearing down th
e signs of the ghetto 
[indecipherable] district, and th
e Japanese arrested them. Oh, everybody said the whole thing 
was just a rumor, nothing true. But two or 
three days later, I think it was on the 14
th
, a plane, 
American plane fl ew real  low, dropping leaflets 
that the war is over, but the Japanese  will have 
control, police control over the 
city until the Americans can come 
in. And then the emperor held 
his speech telling Japan and the whol
e world that  the war is over.  
Q: Did you hear that on the radio? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
96 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: You did. 

A: Obviously I couldn™t understa
nd what he is saying, you know. 
Q: Yeah, I was going to say -- 

A: But we heard this, and then some body was transl
ating it. And then, just 
a few days after that, 
the first Americans came in, they 
came  into the school. It was nice to see them, and after that, all 
right, we now have to go back to work some place, so -- 

Q: Let me  a sk you some thing. Did you folks hear a
bout the -- the two atom
 bombs that had been 
dropped?  

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Did you hear about that later, or in this period? 

A: In this same  period. I mean, it came over the newspapers. 

Q: It did, and -- 
A: Not what we fully understood what an atom bomb was. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But we heard about the destruc
tion of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 
Q: Right. 

A: And na -- to begin with, we were worried 
if -- what would happen if
 they start dropping a 
bomb on Shanghai. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But this happened so rapidl
y from one day to the next. 
Q: Right. 

A: But it was nice. It was a good -- good time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
97 
 
Q: It was a good time [indecipherable] 
A: It was a good time that -- then
 I don™t know where my brother fi
rst went to work, but he -- as 
soon as the American troops came in, he got a j
ob at the airport, and I got a job at another 
machine shop, which was quite filthy. 

Q: Filthy. 

A: Filthy place. And I didn™t like working there, 
but then I got sick, and 
this is where I got -- I 
got sick and said to my mom, l
ook at my bites, I had some  bites on me , turned out to be typhoid 
or typhus. I think it™s typhoid. 

Q: And you were sent to
 the hospital, yes? 
A: And I™d -- sent to the hospital, and I wa
s in the hospital for a
bout three weeks. We -- 
Q: Now, what hospital is this? Is
 this an American run hospital? 
A: No, the refugee hospital. 

Q: Refugee hospital. Is your father 
working at this hospital, or -- 
A: No -- 

Q: -- no. 

A: -- he was working at the clinic. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But this was a hospital th
at they had going all along -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- it was in one of the home s. 

Q: Which they called Heime -- 

A: Heime -- 

Q: -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
98 
 
A: Heime. [indecipherabl e] the Heime, I think 
it was a [indecipherable] time , but then again, I 
can™t be a hundred percent sure. And you know, I 
was in the room with about a dozen other 
people. I had had my shots for typhus, typhoid, chol
era, all along, so I didn™t
 get this illness as 
bad as it could be. There was 
another kid about my age in th
e room, he didn™t have as ma ny 
shots, and he was delirious for days. He eventu
ally had recovered, and 
I eventually recovered. 
But there were people in this room who died while 
I was in there. People us
ed to say, Ernie, turn 
around. And I could hear people ac
tually passing on. In the meantim
e, Mr. Lorenz, who was my 
fore ma n in the other factory, he had a been a stud
ent at the Ze iss factory in Germany. He decided 
to open up a camera repair place. He me t my pare nts on the street, he  said, ﬁDo you think Ernie 
would like to continue hi s apprenticeship with 
me?ﬂ We ll, when I heard that -- course, he didn™t 

call me  Ernie, everybody called me  Ernst at the ti
me . When I heard that, it helped my recovery 
more than anything else. And soon as I wa
s well enough, I started 
working with him.  
Q: Did you know hi m?  
A: Yes, he was my fore ma n --  
Q: Ah, that™s right -- 

A: -- in the --   

Q: -- and you liked him.  

A: -- in the Korean factory. Oh 
yes, he was very nice person. 
Q: And were you attracted to doing work on camer
as, was there some thing attractive for you in 
that?  Or you weren™t sure? 

A: Well, cameras or not, it™s 
the small pieces, the small -- 
Q: Uh-huh. Which you [indecipherable] 

A: -- mechanical -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
99 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- which they used to call fein Mechaniker  in
 German, fine mechanic. And just recently my 
son, who is into genealogy, found a listing of th
e people comi ng over to the United States on a 
ship from Shanghai including our name , and next 
to my na me -- profession, it said mechanic. He 
said, ﬁI didn™t know you were a mechanic.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁ Well, that was fine mechanic,ﬂ -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- that it referred to. But I continued my 
apprenticeship with him by getting into came ras. 
Q: Right. 

A: And here, 60 years later -- 

Q: And here you are [indecipherable] later -- 

A: -- I™ m still at it. 

Q: Now, did your brother get sick at the 
same  time as you, or a 
little bit afterwards? 
A: No, that was before that, I believe. 
Q: Before, uh-huh. 
A: And -- some ti me  before that th
at he had this serious illness. 
Q: And you™re working now in different places? 

A: In different places. He worked for -- he wo
rked for the American military, which I also 
wanted to do because it sounded neat. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But then I got sick and started working for Mr. Lorenz. 

Q: Right. And where do you folks live now?  Wh er
e di -- where did you go
 -- oops -- where did 
you go right after the war, when theAmerican occupation [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
100 
 
A: Well, once the American occupation came in, 
of course we could go move wherever we 
wanted to.  
Q: Right. 

A: And we found an apartment on East Seward Road again -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- but a block away from where we were before
, basically the same  area. And that™s where we 

moved into, and stayed until the -- 

Q: Bigger?  Two rooms instead of one? 

A: Two rooms instead of one. 

Q: Two rooms instead of one. 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Still with a WC? 

A: Still with a WC, defi nitely a WC. 
Q: And -- and what happens to running water atthis point? Do you still have to boil everything, 
this is -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- this is just what it -- 
what it was like then for everybody. 
A: Oh yeah, everybody had to boil their water, definitely. 

Q: And do you know what the occupation was like 
for the Japanese who were there, for the 
Chinese who were ther e, was it harder for them then -- 

A: I couldn't answer that -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: -- you know, because we had no soci
al contact with them at all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
101 
 
Q: Right, right. Wa s there any suspicion 
because you were Germans and Austrians? 
A: From the  Japanese, or -- 

Q: From the  American -- no, from the Americans. 

A: Oh no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no. I mean the -- no, I mean the 
people in charge knew who we were. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, the plain G.I.s, a
nd sailors, they could care less. 
Q: [indecipherable] And is there more help comi ng in once the war is over, from Jewish 

organizations? 

A: Tremendous amount of help. First of all, pack
ages were sent to us of clothing and food, and 
some  of the food we didn™t quite know what to do with, what it is. 

Q: Like what? 
A: Farina. We didn™t -- 
Q: You didn™t [indecipherable] 

A: -- we didn™t know what Farina was,
 my mother finally figured it out. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But we loved the hard salami . 

Q: Really? 

A: You know, that was easy to
 ship, but didn™t spoil. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
102 
 
A: That was just great. We loved the canned 
fruits, you know, canned cherries and so on. The 
cherries we split evenly, one for you, one for me . C
hocolate and everythi ng else, I mean, we just 
loved everything comi ng in. My parents quick
ly began to get their weight back.  
Q: Because they could have more food now -- 
A: Then -- now they could -- 

Q: -- because there™s more. 

A: -- eat mo re [indecipherable]  

Q: Yes. 

A: And my father st ill worked for the clinic, my
 brother worked for the Americans so he made a 
halfway decent salary. 

Q: Right, you worked for -- 

A: For Lorenz and although my salary wasn™t gr
eat, it was great compared to what many other 
kids were doing. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I was ma king 20 American dollars a month, I mean, that was a lot of money. 

Q: That™s a lot of money. 

A: And -- 

Q: So the currency was Amer
ican money at this point? 
A: We ll, we got paid -- we calcula
ted everything in American money. 
Q: I see. 

A: But your everyday purchases 
still was in Chinese money. 
Q: Right. 

A: But the Chinese money changed again. And of course, the inflation was rampant. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
103 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You just couldn™t go by it. 

Q: Is the destruction in Shanghai primarily in 
-- in the Hongkew area?  Ther
e™s no destruction of -
- 

A: There was no real destruction, even in the Ho
ngkew area, other than that one point on July 
17
th
 -- 
Q: There wasn™t much. 

A: -- there wasn™t muc h. The airport got destroyed, 
the -- some  of the piers, some  got destroyed, 
but there was no rampant destruction like you see in what happened in London or in -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- Germany in World War 
11
. 

Q: Now, as time go -- you were there for about two years, until 1947, okay? 

A: Yeah, January ™47. 
Q: As time goes on, do you hear mo re about thedestruction fr om the atom bomb?  Do you -- do 
you get a sense of what that really was? 

A: Yes. The papers were fairly accura
te in what they told us about that . 
Q: Did that hor -- did that 
horrify you, or did you think -- 
A: We ll, the horror, it got overshadowed by what we heard from Ger many. 

Q: Uh-huh, right.  

A: I mean, the paper started running an article 
about Treblinka, one of 
the destructive camps. 
Then we saw newsreels and -- when we
 went to movies, of what occurred. 
Q: Uh-huh. And so you saw newsreels of the camps? 

A: Of the camps. And then the 
realization, these aren™t strang
ers, these are our relatives. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
104 
 
Q: Right. 
A: It™s my uncles, my aunts, my -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- grandmother -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- these are all in there. That real
ization was ve ry, very ha rd to accept.  
Q: So you™re living with the happiness of being -- 

A: Free, on the -- 

Q: -- free on the one hand, and not on the -- 

A: -- on the other hand, I mean, it to
ok a long time to absorb this. 
Q: Yes. 

A: I mean, to this day, none of us can fully comp rehend that. 

Q: Right, right.  
A: Some times read some  of these books of -- whic
h have a graphic description, I mean it -- can™t 
even -- you have to put it down -- 
Q: Sure. 

A: -- put it away. 

Q: Sure.  

A: And wha t  -- when we read about things 
happening in another country, it™s bad enough, but 
when you begin to realize these are 
my people, these are my relatives, that™s -- that was hard to 
accept. An -- 

Q: Did you -- did you see a change in your parents, wa
s this -- di -- did it 
take a lot -- because 
they knew them even be tter than you did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
105 
 
A: Of course.  
Q: Right?  

A: I mean, they was mu ch closer. 

Q: Right. 

A: My mother™s three siblings
 all had gotten out, only her gr
andmother had stayed behind. My 
father had four siblings 
and only one had gotten out. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the one brother that he was so close wi
th, that he was trying to talk into comi ng to 
Shanghai -- 

Q: Didn™t get out. 

A: -- didn™t get out.  

Q: Right. 

A: He had three children. One went to Engla
nd, one went to first Holland -- Denmark, then 
Sweden and eventually is -- Israel or Palestine.
 But the third one, the you
ngest one, stayed with 
them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- but the one that went to England, I f
ou -- eventually ma de contact with and we got 
together. It™s horrible to reali
ze what went through there. And 
that overshadowed a lot of the 
other things. 

Q: Right. Yes. 

A: And then the next step was to ma ke contact 
with the people that were alive. My mother™s 

sister was in Panama , he r brother was in Baltimor
e. Her othe r sister was in Haifa. My father™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504

sister was in Montreal. So we contacted all of th
em, and we decided whatever come s first, that™s 
where we go. 
Q: Where you go. 

A: We  didn™t care where. 

Q: Right. 

A: We ll, it turned out that the United Stat
es came through f-fast. And on Christma s eve, 
December 24
th
, 1946, we got our visa to come  to the 
United States. And of course once you had 
the visa, now you had to figure out how to get he
re. The Joint and other 
Jewish organizations 
took care of that. Wa s shipped -- usually tr
oop ships, which were filled. The first -- 
Q: With troops? 

A: American troops, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But the -- you know, they tried to
 arrange it so that husbands went
 to wives first, parents to 
children, children to parents. And 
we were the first group after that. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we were told we ™d have a ship leaving fi
rst week of February. I ge
t a call at work, Ernie, 
come  on home , we™re leaving in a few days. Wh at 
happened, the ship in Fe
bruary would not take 
any wome n because there were stil
l G.I.s on the boat. So they said, ﬁWell, you and your sons can 
go, but your wife would have to come  on the next 
ship.ﬂ And he -- father 
wouldn™t hear of that. 
Said, ﬁWe™ve stuck together this 
far, we™re not going to split up 
now.ﬂ Is there nothing else we 
can do?  This was on January the fifth. The guy said, 
ﬁWell, there™s a ship leaving on the ninth of 
January, there is still some  room.ﬂ
 He said, ﬁI™ll take it.ﬂ But we
 have to have your heavy stuff 
by day after tomorrow. Okay. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
107 
 
Q: You didn™t have that
 much stuff a nyway. 
A: We  didn™t have that [indeci
pherable] had stuff we had to 
get rid of, you know, like the sewing 
machine I mentioned earlier, and got
 rid of some  of the things. Bu
t we were aboard that ship on 
January ninth, and 13 days later 
we were in San Francisco. 
Q: Wa s it hard to leave Shanghai in some  ways? 
A: No. 

Q: It wasn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: You were glad to get out. 

A: We loved -- we coul
dn™t wait to get out. 
Q: Really? 

A: Our stay in Shanghai, I mean, even though it 
wasn™t that tough for me  as a child, was very 
tough for my parents, my brother, and 
of course it filtered down to me . 
Q: And even after the am
er -- a-after the American occupation, even -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- even then it was not easy. 

A: No, that -- you know, that was 
just a year, so getting out -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and starting a -- a new lif
e was all we could hope for. 
Q: So you were all very happy to get out? 

A: Very happy to get out. Very happy. 

Q: We re there any friends ther
e that you had ma de that you -- 
A: Yes, we had some  close friends. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
108 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: They mo ved different places. One went to
 Australia, and I reme mber him, di ml y. We  
corresponded for awhile. 

Q: And then stopped? 

A: And then it stopped. There was 
-- we actually had a little club that we formed after the war, 
met in the school, called Tikvah, and made some cl
ose friends with them, and one of them ca me  
to Wa shington, and I got to know her -- reunite with them -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- after we got here. I went
 to one reunion where I met -- re-met many of these people from 
the Tikvah club. But it wa sn't  hard to leave. I thin
k it -- yeah, this group fro
m Liegnitz, we all got 
together the night before -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- had dinner together. And -- 
Q: That original group? 
A: That original group. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The Brauns, the Ritters -- 

Q: The Ritters and -- 

A: Mr. Salinger. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And we said goodbye to each ot her because we 
all went  in different directions. We came to 
Baltimore, Brauns went to London, Ritters went to
 ta -- Palestine, and Salinger went ba ck to 
Germany. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
109 
 
Q: Get his wife. 
A: To his wife. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And my parentscorresponded with
 them for a fairly long time. 
Q: Mm-hm. Had you rema ined fairly close with them whi -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- the whole time  you were in Shanghai? 

A: Yes. Yeah, in fact, we alwa
ys celebrated Passover together. 
Q: Really? 

A: Mr. Braun was the onewho conducted the service. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I was alwa ys the youngest in all 
my life, to say the four questions. 
Q: Right. 
A: Manishtana. And he used to practice, and I 
had to come  over his hous
e to help -- to do my 
part, and to practice. 
Q: I see, so you would do it well. 

A: So I would do it well. 

Q: Right. 

A: But e-even in Germany, my mother™s family, wh
ere we used to have Se der together with her 
fa mily, I was always the youngest of all the cousins. 

Q: Right. 

A: Then in this group I was the you
ngest. So I was always the youngest. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
110 
 
A: But s-say that by heart in Hebrew to this day 
to a great extent. But it must have been very 
hard for my parents to say goodbye to them -- 
Q: To them.  

A: -- because we spent so much -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- time together.  

Q: And you shared a huge decisi
on to even go to Shanghai. 
A: Decision to go to Sha
nghai, to live together. 

Q: Right. 

A: To do that lunchroom together. 

Q: Right. 

A: And even afterwards we 
stayed very close. And -- 
Q: Was America what you expected? 
A: In most cases, yes. 
Q: Yes? 

A: In ma ny cases better and some  cases not so
 good. And by that, the r
acial discrimi nation. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I thought that this business w
ith the blacks being different from
 the whites went out with the 
Civil Wa r. And of course, especially in Ma
ryland and Baltimore, that wa s not the case. 
Q: Right. 

A: There was still a lot of discrimi nation in 
1947 and ™48. Wh en we came here, of course, the 
first thing, you had to find a j
ob. We  had a little bit of money 
that we had brought with us, but 
not very much. And so looking for a job was the fi
rst thing, and we had re
latives here, mother™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
111 
 
brother and his family. They f
ound out that Henry was a me chan
ic, and -- not an automobile 
mechanic, but a machinist, I should say. 
Q: Right. 

A: So they got him a job in Bethlehem Steel, whic
h was not to his liking because that was quite a 
distance from where we lived, and it remi nded 
him like being shoved off to Allensbach in 
Shanghai. When he -- my cousin heard that I 
was a camera repairman, he took me into Ritz 
camera center, and they hired me, and I was with 
Ritz for about 10 years. So I had a job a week 

after we got here, my brother had 
a job a week after we got here. 
Q: Your mother? 

A: My brother. 

Q: Your brother, right, 
at Bethlehem Steel, right. 
A: At Bethlehem Steel. And my 
fa ther went to the Jewish Co
mmunity Center and talking to 
those people he says, I™ll be 
a Fuller Brush ma n, whatever you can find me. And he was told, no, 
wa -- I™ll find you some t hing better, and a few m
onths later found him a job in a hospital. In 
Maryland you could work as a physician in a hos
pital without having to 
take all the tests. 
Q: Really? 

A: But this was a sa -- a sanitarium for colore
d people. So he was in a place called Henryton, 
working his profession, very happy li
ving there. My mother decided to
 live in Baltimore to take 
care of Henry and I. They got t
ogether on -- on weekends. And -- but 
this is some  more of this 
discrimi nation that I was talking about, these doc
tors, African-Ame rican doctors used to tell my 
father, when you go into downtown Baltimore, you can go into any rest aurant -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
112 
 
A: -- drugstore, have thi -- some thing to eat, or 
to drink, we can™t do that
. Theaters, some  you can 
go to, some you can™t. And that -- th
at surprised me , that was one of
 the things that surprised me . 
But other than that, it was just gr eat.  
Q: It was easier than being in Shanghai, I guess. 

A: Much easier -- 

Q: In a ce -- in a certain -- 

A: -- much easier. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And we became assimilated as fast as we 
coul d. We wanted to be as American as -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- and the next guy. 

Q: Now you were 17 when you came  and your brother was 21. 

A: 21. 
Q: So you™re no longer kid kids any more. 
A: No, no. You know, I -- I ma de friends very qu
ickly, and some  of the people I ma de friends 
with I™m still friends with today. 

Q: Are you? That™s great. Would [i
ndecipherable] change the tape. 
End of Tape Six

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Ernie, what did your father actually do in 
this hospital?  Was he ju
st a regular physician? 
A: Regular attending physician -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- it was a TB hospital. There were  quite 
a fe w little children ther e, and he loved little 
children, got some  pictures at hom
e, him and the little children. 
Q: And he lived there, so when 
did you and -- and Henry see him?   
A: On weekends. 

Q: So, just -- 

A: Henry -- Henry got a -- a -- the idea was, wh
en Henry was so unhappy with working in -- at 
Bethlehem Steel, my father said to him, as 
soon as I have a job, you can quit there and find 
something else.  

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And he did. He found a position as a salesm
an for a paper company selling wrappi ng paper 
and all that kind of stuff to re
tail stores, hos -- hospitals -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- hotels, etcetera. And for that, of course, he  needed a car, so we bought him a car, and with 

that car we --  

Q: You went back and forth. 

A: Back and forth. 

Q: I see. And did your father have an apartment there? 

A: Yes. 

Q: He did?  So y -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
114 
 
A: And my mother stayed there sometimes for days
, but she wanted to take care of Henry and I, 
so she stayed in Baltimore with us. 
Q: So you all four were -- were subsidizing two apartments. 

A: Well, the ap -- the apartment in
 the -- in Henryton, he didn™t ha
ve to pay for it, that was -- 
Q: I see, that was given to him, I see. 

A: -- that was given to him as part of his pay. 

Q: Right. 

A: My mother could have st
ayed there too, with him.  
Q: Right, but she preferred to stay with you guys. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Now I understand that one of the reasons you came  to Baltimore, because her brot he r was 

there. 

A: That™s correct . 
Q: And then pretty much after you came , they d
ecided they were -- or had they already decided 
they were going to California. 
A: Well -- 

Q: Which was a little odd, right? 

A: Yes. It -- my mother became very upset a
bout that, because when we came into California, 
when we landed in San Francisco, friends of my
 parents from Germany, who were living in San 
Francisco, we re there welcoming us. And the Joint 
gave us a hotel room where we could spend a 
little bit of time with them. Thes
e were two brothers, they were 
not ma rried, two brothers who, in 
Liegnitz had departme nt stores, 
some thing, but they came to San 
Francisco and lived there. And 
said, ﬁWhy do you go to Baltimore?  Everybody from th
e east is comi ng west.ﬂ My mother said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
115 
 
ﬁ Well, all these years, with all th
at we nt on, I want to get back a
nd at least be with my brother.ﬂ 
So we came  to Baltimore, we settled down a little 
bit, and they tell us that they are planning to 
move to San Francisco. My mother was furious. Y
ou could have told us that ahead of time, we 
would have stayed in San Francisc
o, the -- I forgot what their name
 was -- told us to just stay 
there. Anyhow, they decided to 
go there, first their son, and th
en they. And my uncle couldn™t 
find a job. So after awhile they came back to Ba
ltimore. In the me anti me  we had really settled 
down extremely rapidly. I had a nice job, ma yb
e it wasn™t paying a fortune, but more than 
mi ni mu m wage. Henry eventually had the job with 
this paper company, he  stayed with them for 
over 40 years until he retired. 
Q: Wo w.  

A: And we ma de friends. My pare
nts ma de friends with other ref
ugee people that lived there. I 
joined a fraternity, it ha d nothing to do with a 
college, it was like a club, and as I said, I™m still 
friends with these people today. A few 
years ago we had our 50 year reunion. 
Q: Really? 

A: Just the three couples, one young -- one ma n 
moved onto New York and is now in upstate 
New York, and we call each other on the phone ever
y once in awhile, once in awhile we see each 
other. So it was a very deep fr
iendship that developed there. My 
brother also became  friends with 
quite a few people, he ha d now a decent job, ni ne  t 
-- ni ne to five, so to speak, rather than all 
hours of the day and night that they had in Beth
lehem Steel. He had a car so he could get around. 
Began to teach me  how to drive, which was -- 

Q: That was good. 

A: -- it was good to a point. Eventually
 I went to a driving school, and -- 
Q: I see. You needed a be tter teacher. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
116 
 
A: We ll, would -- he was so nervous because 
he had no controls, you know what I -- driving 
school the guy has all 
the controls there. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And that -- so we had no intentions of
 leaving Baltimore to go to San Francisco. 
Q: Did you want to go to school? 

A: No. That™s my problem, I didn™t want to
 go to school. I liked 
-- I liked ma king money. 
Q: I see. 

A: I liked work, I liked ma king money. But people sa
id to us -- used to say to us, in America you 
don™t need schooling. They don™t care about your 
schooling, it™s what you know that counts, 
what you can do that counts. We ll, that™s not tr
ue. And eventually some body said to my father, 
look, your boys don™t even have a high school diploma.
 You need to see to 
it that they get some  
schooling. So Henry and I went to night school, 
Baltimore City College, which although it has 
the name  college in it, is really
 a high school. We  went to night 
school, and sent our report cards 
from Shanghai to a departme nt of education here
 in Wa shington. That eventually came back, and 
they just went by our age into which grade we
 should go. So in the me antime, what should we 
take, we -- English, of course, American hist
ory and some  other subjects. We took tests in 
German for both Germa n one and for German 
two, which we passed with about a 90 degree 
setting. And then we heard about the 
ga -- high school equivalent tests.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we both took that and passed that. 

Q: So you got your high school degree. 

A: So we have our high school de
gree. Recently I happened to come
 across a report card of that. 
I had 99 plus in ma the matics, so ma thematics 
was my field. But we didn™t go on to college.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
117 
 
Q: And neither one of you wanted to? 
A: Henry did go. 

Q: He did? 

A: He went to -- he went to Baltimor e City Co
llege and took a two year 
course there. I was not 
eager at the time, which --  

Q: Mm. 

A: -- and I had no encouragement from my parents.
 In the meantime, my  pa -- father had passed 
away, and my mother depended on Henry and I -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- to keep her going. 

Q: Now, your father had a -- a goiter 
when he was in Shanghai, and this -- 
A: My father had a goiter fr
om when he was a young ma n.  

Q: Uh-huh.  
A: During World Wa r 
1
 is when he fi rst noticed it. And it was in the ar my at the time, German 
army. But this is 1914 - 1918 -- 
Q: Right. 

A: He had had a friend who had a goiter remove
d and he became  a vegetable afterwards.  
Q: So your father was afraid. 

A: My father said, I don™t need that, this is just
 a beauty spot. People eith
er like me  or don™t like 
me with it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and just kept that. However,
 that put a tremendous strain on 
his heart, pos -- probably had 
some  effect on his heart attacks. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
118 
 
Q: Because it was growing? 
A: It was growi
ng internally -- 

Q: Internally. 

A: -- yeah, always. And it put a pressure on his heart. 

Q: Yes.  

A: So after we™re here for awhile, we  have to m
eet some  of t he doctors here, they said, look, why 
don™t you have it taken care of now?  We 
have Johns Hopkins Hospital here -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- one of the best hospitals in the world. He
 said, ﬁBut what about my heart?ﬂ I mean, now 
after the initial heart 
attack in Germany, he had had anot
her heart attack in Shanghai.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: Not as severe, but it was a h
eart attack. They said, well, le
t™s take you under observation and 
then see how your heart will hold up for an operation. So he di d that, went into Hopkins , and we 
went to visit him one Sunday in
 December, and while we were there the doctor come s in. We ™ve 
checked your heart, you™ve been under observation, 
your heart is fine, you™ll be able to do it. 
We™ve scheduled the operation for tomorrow, next day. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Well, he ex -- my father excused himself af
ter a few mi nutes, he had to go to the bathroom, 
didn™t come  back. All of a sudden we hear, Dr. So
 and So, Dr. So and So, calling him. My father 
had had a heart attack. They wheel
ed him back into the room, they
 chased us out, and that™s ho -- 
when he died.  

Q: Oh my. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
119 
 
A: His heart just wasn™t  able to take this, or 
whatever. Compl e tely -- I -- I for one never expected 
him to die. That really got to me . 
Q: Mm. 

A: And my mother now depended completely on 
my brother and I to take care of her. No 
encouragement to me  to go to school, so I 
didn™t. Two years later, 1951, I got drafted.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that -- after I come out of the army, instead
 of taking advantage of the G.I. bill, I went 
right back to work. My own fault, I should have
 gone to college. It would have been paid for 
under the G.I. bill. But with no encouragement, in just the other way, you know, you got to go 

back to work so you can support me , I went back to work.  

Q: And who was supporting your mo ther when you were -- when you were in the army? 

A: My brother.  

Q: Your brother. 
A: And I. 
Q: And you, because you were sending back the money. 

A: I sent back half of my  pay, I mean, I got 80 do
llars a month as a privat
e, sent 40 bo -- dollars 
back home. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: While the other guys got money from home, I  sent
 it back. And my brother was just above the 
age to be drafted, and the age was at 26, and -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- so he just escaped being drafted. 

Q: And you didn™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
120 
 
A: And I didn™t, and you know, so once I got home 
-- my brother got married while I was in the 
service, and -- 
Q: Did you know?  Wa s he dating this person before? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You did -- so you knew her? 

A: Yes. I knew her. And this -- also from 
-- she™s actually from Vienna. And they took an 

apartment just a few doors away fr
om my mother™s house, or mothe
r™s apartment, didn™t have a 
house, and my mother used to cook dinner for th
em. So they came over her house for dinner, and 
then went home . But then I came home , and I move
d in with my mother and stayed there, and 
this is still in Baltimore. In the meantime I went 
back to Ritz camera centers, and they told me -- 

Eddie Ritz, a very fine ma n, you know, they had 
to send repairs out while you were gone, so now 
how about -- we think you™d be better salesman 
than a repairma n. So I went into sales, worked 
my way up to assistant ma nager. And one day I 
got a call from Eddie Ritz out of Wa shington, we 
just bought this place called Br
enner photo, how would you like to 
be ma nager of the store here 
in Wa shington?  And that™s how I ended up in Washington. 

Q: Right. 

A: But instead of moving to Washington, my moth
er put it very bluntly, 
well, if you move to 
Washington, you™d have to pay for two apar
tments. So I commuted for about a year. 
Q: By train, by car? 

A: By train. 

Q: By train, mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
121 
 
A: And then, after awhile I left Ritz camerasand then went for another comp -- with another 
company called Industrial Photo in Silver Sp
ring, but there was no good train connection to 
Silver Spri ng -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and I commuted by car. And couldn™t wait to ge
t out of my mother™s house, so first chance 
I had, found a girlfriend, we decided to 
get married and move to Washington. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Now [indecipherable] 

Q: But you still supported your mother. 

A: I still supported my mother. 

Q: Yeah. Did you get along with your mother? 

A: Oh. To some  degree, yes. Retroactively I re
sent a lot of what happened. This business of 
ma king us support her, not letting us have a life
 of our own. I got ma rried and when this young 
lady and I talked about ma rriage, I said, ﬁBut, 
you know, you™ve got to re
alize, I™ve got to send 
some  money to my mother every mo
nth, every week.ﬂ And it was tough -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- on our weddin -- on our ma rriage. Eventually
 she got some  money out of Ger many, a small 
pension. 

Q: [indecipherable] I see, yes. 

A: And that™s when it ma de it 
a little easier on us. But I move
d to Wa shington and visited my 
mother very frequently, but even
 that was not frequently enou
gh. So there was quite a bit of 
resentme nt that built up in me . 

Q: Wa s she very isolated, do you think?
 Or did she have friends that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
122 
 
A: She had ma de lots of friends among the German Jews. 
Q: But she still wanted this association with you and Henry. 

A: We ll, you know, she wanted that, sh
e wanted our financial support.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And ma de no strong effort to learn the languageor to find a job. And it was very difficult to 

build up a family life of
 our own, with that.  
Q: And did you have children?  Th
is is your first wife, yes? 
A: My first wife, yeah. 

Q: You had -- 

A: We  had -- we had three children. 

Q: -- two -- three children.  

A: One of whom unfortunately be -- died a few years ago. 

Q: Mm. 
A: But they all got to know
 my grandmother -- my -- their grandmother, my mother. 
Q: Right, right.  
A: Although the youngest probably hardly reme mbered her. 

Q: And do they live in the ar
ea, your children? The two? 

A: The two -- one lives in Philadelphi
a, just outside of Philadelphia. 
Q: Right. 

A: One is now here in northern Virginia. 

Q: How nice. 

A: But she is married to a man in the diplomatic
 service, so every once in awhile they are -- 
Q: They™re [i ndecipherable] yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
123 
 
A: -- in other places, which is usually
 fine, we have a place to visit. 
Q: Right. 
A: They™ve been in Lisbon, I visited them in
 Lisbon, I™ve -- we visited them in Moscow. 
Q: Great. 

A: So it™s very nice, and they 
have a little boy. My son has two 
sons, one of whom is getting 
ready to go to college this fall. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my son-in-law never rema rried after my da
ughter died, but has a litt
le -- a little daughter, 
a young daughter.  

Q: Right. 

A: She is now in high school, so they™re not little any more. And -- 

Q: And I gather your daughter was ill. 

A: My daughter had an illness that
 came  about, well it was in her al
l her life. I can™t
 think of the 
name  right now, but it was a illness of the connecting tic -- tissue. Ehle
rs -- Ehlers-something 
syndrome. She one day developed a sore on her le
g which wouldn™t heal, they had to decide to 
amputate the leg. And then it a-attacked other pa
rts of her body. And it™s some thing I can™t get 
over.  

Q: It™s awful. 

A: I mean, you expect your parents to die before you. 

Q: Right. You don™t expect your children -- 

A: You sometimes expect your mate to pass 
away, but you don™t expect the children to die 
before you. It™s -- that™s the tough part.  

Q: Yeah. And you divorced in the 60™s, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
124 
 
A: No, late -- later on. When did I divorce?  
About 15 years ago -- no, 18 years ago, cause it was 
just before my oldest grandson was born. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  divorced, there were ma ny reasons for it, 
and once the children were out of the house, it 
became mor e obvious that we don™t fit together. 

Q: Right. 

A: And it was a -- about as friendl
y a divorce as you can have, I gue
ss. One day we just looked at 
each other and said, do we really want to continue
 our lives like that, and 
we decided no. So first 
I suggested she find a place to live,
 and then I would sell the house and I™d find a place to live, 
figuring it™s easier for a ma n to find an apartm
ent than a woma n. And sh
e started to look around, 
she said, ﬁWhy would you want to sell this house, 
I mean, it™s some thing valuable that we have.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁWell the house is too big for one person to
 live in.ﬂ Said, ﬁWell if you don™t want it, then 
I want it.ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, that™s fine, you know, 
I™ll find a place to live,ﬂ and I moved out. And 
you know, fi nancial arrangeme nts that we ma de betw
een us hit some  hard times, but not bad, not 
really bad.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And she eventually rema rried, and a few years later I me t some body a nd rema rried. 

Q: Right. 

A: And a good friend of mi ne asked me  [indeciphe
rable] how is ma rriage a second time  around?  
I said, ﬁWell, if it™s that much better the s
econd time  around, I can™t wa
it for the third time 
around.ﬂ 

Q: So it™s a good relationship. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
125 
 
A: It™s a very nice relationship, we do a lot of thi
ngs together, we travel a lot. We  bo -- she™s also 
divorced, so we learned from 
our mi stakes the first time. 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: And any divorce, it™s 
not one person™s fault -- 
Q: It™s not. 

A: -- it™s always two people who are not necessarily at fault, things just
 don™t work out right. 

There are many, ma ny parts that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- play a part in this. 

Q: Whe -- when you look back, it™s -- in a way 
what I™m going to say is a stupid question, but -- 
because I don™t know exactly how you take someth
ing out of your life and say if -- what would 
have happened if this didn™t happen to me . 
But I don™t know whether you experience what 
Shanghai has done to you. The move  out of Germa
ny, the effect on your fa mily and all of that.  
A: I think I am a ware of it. 

Q: You are? 

A: My life -- I mean, I look at what my life woul
d have been like if Nazi
sm wouldn™t have come  
to Germany. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I would have gone to college, I would have become  a doctor or lawyer -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- some  professional. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
126 
 
A: I would have had a great life, you know, I woul
d not have had to worry about supporting my 
parents, they would have s
upported me . Probably would have 
gone into a profession where I 
could make -- I™ve made a decent living, and -- inst
ead of what I ende d up with. I mean, I didn™t 
do bad. Considering what I went through, I did very well. 
Q: Right, right. And you enjoyed it, it seems. 

A: I -- I enjoye
d most of it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- but I find -- I -- you know
, I get together with people
 my age or even younger, and 
they talk about thei r college life, which I™d 
never experienced. I never experienced living by 
myself until I divorced. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because I went from my mo
ther™s house, got ma rried -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- into married life. The three years between 
my separation from my wife, and before I me t 
Anya, I enjoyed those, because I was on my own.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I was able to take  care 
of myself, I 
didn™t starve. 
Q: Right. 

A: Figured out how to cook, more or less, and I 
missed out on that part 
of my youth. I never had 
a teenage life, or a young 
adult life. So yes, I mi ssed that. I d
ecided a couple of times to go back 
to take college courses, but didn™t really follo
w through on it. I did all right in my profession. I 
eventually, after I left Ritz Came ra Center, 
went with a comp any called Industrial Photo, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
127 
 
became their general manager and vice president, and did fairly well for myself. But it™s not the 
same  as wha t  I could have been, or would have been. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: [inaudible] you know, I can hold 
my own wit h other people, I -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- have enough education of 
-- by reading and studying on my ow
n. But certain things I just 
mi ssed out on. You know, it -- like one time I tried to
 -- I considered open
ing up my own ca mera 
store, but then I became scared. I am not a big risk
 taker, I™d rather let ot
he r people take the risk 
and I work for them, but that doesn™t get you very far. 

Q: But you were in a very high risk situation 
as a child, it ma kes perf
ect sense, doesn™t it? 
A: Uh-huh, I guess.  

Q: It wasn™t your choi
ce, it was certainly -- 
A: It was not my choice. 
Q: No, but it certainly wa s a high risk situation. 
A: It was a very high risk situa
tion, I mean, we escaped Germany -- 
Q: Barely. 

A: -- barely escaped Germany. In Shanghai I got 
bombed out, I mean I easily could have been 
killed ther e. 

Q: Right. 

A: And to think about what would have ha
ppened if we wouldn™t have left Germany -- 
Q: You wouldn™t be sitting here. 

A: -- is really un -- I wouldn™t be sitting here. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
128 
 
A: Really be unthinkable. 
Q: Right. 

A: To realize what happened to 
my cousin, my uncles, my aunts, 
can™t -- I can™t dwell on that too 
long, it™s too horrible. You read some books a
nd you wonder how one human being could do that 
to another. 

Q: Right. 

A: And yet, it™s still ha ppening today. Not necessa
rily against the Je ws, but human beings can be 
very cruel. 

Q: Right. Are you a religious person? 

A: No, not at all. 

Q: Do you think that this set of events dest
royed the possibility of 
becomi ng religious, do you 
think, or were -- you were just 
-- weren't that way all along? 
A: No, it has -- I think the last
 straw was my daughter™s death. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I always say if -- there can™t  be a God who 
can let si x million people di e, with one million of 
children, and then I say it™s really six million and one. 

Q: And one, right. 

A: So, I™m really an atheist in 
-- as far as my belief is concerned. I™m a cultural Jew, and ethnic 
Jew, but not religious.  

Q: Not religious. We ll, I want to thank you very 
much for taking the time to speak with us today, 
and speak with me . 

A: We ll, thank you for asking me , I feel privileged. 

Q: You™re more than welcome, it™s a privilege for me . Thank you.

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: What is this shot here? 
A: This is actually a shot of the Main Street of
 Liegnitz. Legnica is called now. At one point in 
Shanghai, some body ca me  across this as a picture 
postcard and gave it to 
my mother when they 
saw that it wa s town we were born in -- I was 
born in. And you see the streetcar on its single 
track down the street, and thos
e two dome s in the back, I don™t reme mber the name  of t he 

church, but was the center part of
 Liegnitz, and it -- the main 
shopping center. This must have 
been taken some time in the early 30™s.  

Q: And who is this couple? 

A: These are my mother™s parents. Their last
 name  was Lewy, pronounced
 Levy in German. His 
name  is Isadore and her name  is Ros a . And my gr
andfather had a little go
atee, looks a little bit 
like Lenin. He -- what I reme mber about him is as 
a child he fell out of a tree, and they had to 

amputate one of his fingers. And when we went 
for walks, it always felt funny when that one 
finger was mi ssing. He passed away in 1936, of a nor
ma l death, I forgot -- I have no idea what it 
was. But my  grandmother lived on and then
 eventually ended up in Theresienstadt. 
Q: And Ernie, who are -- who is this? 

A: These are my father™s parents. I ne
ver met them. They died during Wo rld War 
1
. I am not sure 
what they died of, it mi ght have been from that
 flu epidemic that went all around the world at 
that time. But these pictures must
 have been taken before the 20
th
 century started. I have the 
originals in the frame in my bedroom. And we
ll I™m -- as I say, I don™t know too much about 
them. 

Q: And their name s?  

A: Emil is his name, and now you got me, I don™t reme mber. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
131 
 
Q: You remember [inde cipherable] 
A: I -- Hanne, I believe. I think it
™s Hanne, well don™t quote me  on this one. 
Q: And this shot? 

A: This is my father, his name was August,
 and -- on his motorcycle. He didn™t have the 
motorcycle any more by the time  I was born. He
 and my mother cruised on the motorcycle all 
through Germany, and e ventually they bought a car
. And then when I came  along, a bigger car. 
So the story goes that my  brother asked once, w
hy didn™t you buy a bus in the first place?  But he 
loved gadgets like this, and people recognized 
when the doctor was visiting some place by the 
motorcycle. 

Q: Do you have any idea 
what year that was? 

A: We ll, it is probably in the 20™s, the 
mi d- 20™s, because Henry was born in 1925. 
Q: Right. 

A: So it would have been before that. 
Q: And this picture? 
A: This is my whole fa mily, my father, obviously 
doing quite well, not on a di
et at that point. My 
mother, Betty, that™s me  on her lap, and my br
other Henry on the other side. This was taken 
when Henry and I had whooping cough, and we we
re out in the country some place, and my 

father went to town to his practice, and then
 came ho -- back in the evening, and one day he 
came back with a brand new car. 

Q: And who is this group? 

A: This is my nursery school. The lady in th
e back is Miss Sc hroeder, who was the owner 
[indecipherable] of the school, and I™m
 the little guy right in
 front of her. I have no idea of any of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
132 
 
the name s of the others, but this is Miss Schroe
der, who had to kick me  out cause one of the 
other kid™s parents didn™t lik
e a Jewish boy in there. 
Q: And Mrs. Schroeder™s the one who came with flowers for your mother. 
A: With flowers, to my mother, to tell me  about it. 

Q: And this shot?   

A: This was my first day of school. In Germa
ny it was common practice that on your first day of 
school you got a cone filled with candy. That™s my
 brother, putting his hand on my shoulder for 
support. But I obviously enjoyed the candy afterwards.  

Q: And this group? 

A: This is my first year of school, my  first gradeclass. I™m in the front in the center. They -- right 

there. And my teacher Mr. Thie
l is in the backgr ound there. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That™s him right there. Basically had a pr
etty good time in school th
ere. And I reconnected 
with Mr. Thiel when I was in the military after 
World War -- after -- no, during the Korean War. 

Q: And this one? 

A: We ll, this is me  in my liederhosen. And it™s ha
rd to tell who is more proud, my father of me , 
or me  of my  father. But I believe this was taken 
in the mountains not too far from where we used 
to live. 

Q: And how old do you think you are there? 

A: My guess is about seven. 

Q: So you think 1936? 

A: Yes, approxima tely. 

Q: No -- no, December -- no, ™36. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
133 
 
A: ™36 approximately. It™s -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know if in the album I even have the dates on there.  

Q: And this? 

A: This is probably on the second year in Shanghai. Both my brother Henry and I joined the 

British Boy Scout association. He as a scout, a
nd I as a Wolf Cub. Here we call them Cub 
Scouts. 

Q: A Wolf Cub? 

A: It was refe rred to as Wolf Cub. This was actua
lly taken across the street from where we used 
to live.  

Q: And wha t  do we see here? 

A: Here we see what is left of the 
SACRA building after the bombing on July 17
th
, 1945. You 
can see the bomb holes on top, and th
ere™s a little gate in that wall 
that we  used to enter in. The 
building has been razed, and there™s anot
her apartment building in its place now. 
Q: So was your apartme nt, once you 
got inside, you went
 [indecipherable] 
A: We ll it -- if you can imagine a school
, where you have a walkway all around -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and rooms all around, we 
were actually in the back -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- of this, but several bombs fell onto 
the building, and substa
ntial destruction.  
Q: And this shot?   

A: This was taken in the school building when we
 were living there, after the bombardme nt. And 
they came by with these big bins of food, and dol
ed out enough food for every family. We  used 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0504  
134 
 
to stand in line with our pots, waiting for them 
t o show up, but eventually we kids just let the 
pots stand there, and we played on the playgr
ound until they came by. And th -- each one got a 

little bit of food. That
 what we lived on. 
Q: This shot [indecipherable] 

A: This is back in -- being a Boy Scout. The wa r is over, and during the war we often me t, but 

didn™t dress up in uniform, always had to be ba
ck home  before 10 o™clock when curfew came 
about. And now we started to take some  trip
s around Shanghai. That™s me right there.  
Q: And this shot? 

A: This is my fa mily in our last apartment, taken by the photographer who took the passport 

pictures for the visa. And we asked him to take 
one of the whole family, 
my brother on the left, 

my father, my mother and me . 

Q: And this is in Shanghai? 

A: This is in Shanghai in our apartme nt.
