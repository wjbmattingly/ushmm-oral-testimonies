Firs t, before I invite Mic hel on to the stage, I'll s how you a brief s lide s how that we've prepared

We begin with this  por trait of Mic hel Margos is  as a young m an

year s  old
 i
n this photo?  13. 13 year s  old.
 
Mic hel's  par ents , you c an s ee her e, wer e Rus s ian
-
bor n J ews . 
His  father had been a polic em an in Rus s ia and had been depor ted to Siberia for  being an outs pok en 
Zionis t.
 
 
After esc aping, Mic hel's  father and his  wife made their way to Belgium. On this  m ap of 
Europe, the ar row points  to Belgium. And on this  m ap of Belgium, the arr ow points  to Br us s els .
 
 
Mic hel Mar gos is  was  born on Sep
tember
 
2, 1928, in Br us s els, Belgium. This  photograph 
s hows  Mic hel, his  m other , and two of his  three s iblings .

In Br us s els , Mic hel's  father  owned and edited two news paper s , one French and one Yiddis h. 
In the back ground of this s lide we s ee a c lip from  his
 
Yiddis h news paper. And the photo in fr ont is  of 
Mic hel's  father 's  pr es s  c ar d.
 
 
In 1940, when the Germans  invaded Belgium , Mic hel and his  fam ily fled to the South of 
Fr ance wher e they ended up in the s lums of Mar s eille. The arrows  s how their r oot from  Belg
ium to 
Souther n Franc e.
 
As Michel pointed out to m e earlier, this is  an over s im plific ation as we s hall hear. 
He'll tell us  m ore when we talk together.
 
 
Her e we s ee a picture of 13
-
year
-
old Mic hel, walking down a s tr eet in Mar s eille.
 
The Margos is  
family ha
d hoped to get exit vis as  and to s ail for the United States; howev er, they did not s ucc eed in 
obtaining the vis as  and they es c aped over  the Pyr enees  
M
ountains  into Spain. The yellow ar row on this 
m ap s hows  their es c ape route.
 
 
Ar r angements wer e m ade for Michel to come to the United States. This photograph is of 
Mic hel s aying goodbye to his  father in Por tugal befor e he leaves  for  the United States .
 
 
In 1943, Mic hel em igr ated with other c hildr en to the United States on the Serpa Pinto, s hown 
on the pos tc ar d on the r ight. On the left we have a news paper  artic le about their depar ture. The arr ow 
is  pointing to Mic hel in that pic ture.
 
 
So I'll invite Mic hel up to the stage in a s ec ond. But before I do, I s hould als o add that he had 
a ver y long c areer as  a res ear c h
 
c hem ist with the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis tration, did a lot of wor k 
with antibiotic s . Mic hel s erved in the U.S. Arm y. And now he is  ver y, very  ac tive in his  c ommunity and 
volunteers  in many, many plac es  among them  we ar e for tunate to c ount him am ong our
 
volunteers 
her e at the mus eum.
 
 
I think  with that, I will inv ite Mic hel to join me on the s tage. He'll be able to tell
 
us  m ore detail 
about his  s tor y and give you m or e inform ation about the r es t of his  journey.
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  It's  great to be here with you today. I've wor ked at this  mus eum for a num ber of 
year s  off and on and have had the good fortune of being fr iends with Mic hel for a good 15, 16 years . So 
it's  nic e to be up here together with you.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Thank  you.
 
>> Bets
y Anthony:  So now you have an idea, a sketc h, a very, very brief sketc h, of Mic hel's  family 
his tory.Why don't you s tar t
 
--
 
m aybe you c ould s tart by telling us m ore about your  father 's  exper ienc es , 
before Belgium.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Well, he es c aped
 
--
 
he arr anged for an es c ape fr om Siberia for a gr oup of about 
500. He was  one of the sur vivor s  of about 15 who had s urvived the es c ape. Made his  way, eventually 
by foot, to Pales tine.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Why was  he in Siberia? 
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  Firs t he went to Pers ia.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  But as  I understood, he got in
 
tr ouble in Russia for being an outs poken Zionis t?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  He had a Zionis t teac her .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I s ee.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  He learned Hebrew and Yiddis h fr om the teac her.
 
But he then bec am e a Zionis t. 
The government didn't lik e that. Sothey s hipped him  out to Siber ia, in
 
a c amp. He didn't like it.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  So he arranged for an esc ape of about 500 and he was  one of about 15
 
who 
m ade it. Eventually he made his  way to Per s ia, whic h is  now c alled Ir an. And a c olleague ther e helped 

him  to bec ome a Per s ian c itizen s o that if he wanted to tr avel, now we wer e Per s ian.
 
My sis ter  and 
br other wer e bor n there. 
 
 
Then being a Zionis t, he wanted to go to Pales tine. So he went. My s is ter  c ontr acted polio. 
They c ould not tr eat her  ther e, in Palestine, for polio, s o he took her  to Germany and then to Belgium  
wher e s he was  oper ated on. And lo and behold, he c ouldn't get back  to Pales tine.
 
> > Betsy Anthony:  When your  father was  in Persia, your  m other joined him ther e.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Yeah.

> > Betsy Anthony:  And your s iblings  were born there.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  My m other had to be ther e for the kids to be here.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I gues s  that 
m akes s ens e. Ok . Thanks for c learing that up. [Laughter]
 
Fr om ther e, he went to Pales tine.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Dad went to Pales tine.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I s ee. So ultim ately the whole family ended up in Belgium.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  In Belgium. And he didn't get back  to Palestine. And I as s um e that's  bec aus e of 
s ever al r eas ons . The Britis h m andate did not allow too many J ews  ther e. The Arabs didn't like him 
ther e. The J ewis h agency did not want intellec tuals . By that tim e m y father had becom e a 
news paperm a
n. So we were s tranded in Belgium  and I was  born.
 

> > Bets y Anthony:  They didn't want intellec tuals  bec aus e
 
--
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  They wer e looking for farmer s  to do the land. So then I was  bor n in Belgium. My 

c ulture was bas ic ally French. So Belgium back  then had two national languages, Flemis h and Fr enc h. 
And Flemis h I forgot as soon as  I left. Today they als o have German as  a national language. So 
bas ic ally I was  rais ed with that c ultur e.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Can you tell us  a little bit about life as  a 
c hild in Belgium
, 
before the Ger mans, of 
c our se?
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  Well, I went to s c hool. I learned the Fr enc h c ultur e, literature. I lear ned how to 
wr ite, how to r ead, how to c ount. I played hooky like ever ybody els e. 
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony: 
 
No doubt. Yeah.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  I was  jus t a little bum.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  But you had a good childhood there, a good life.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  My father  started a new life over ther e. We had little s hops  fir s t. Then he was  able 
to open up a pr inting plant, eventually, with the news papers . I helped him in the plant oc c as ionally. Do 
little print jobs . And then the war c ame.
 
He was  editor. He had r ead "Mein Kam pf." He had r ead about 
Germ an polic ies , and his exper ienc e with the Comm unist
 
r egim e in Rus s ia and he s ort of expec ted 
what was  c om ing with Hitler .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  He had experienc e and c ould Intuit
 
--
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Exper ienc ed dic tator s hip.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I think you had jus t turned 11 or you turned 11 the day after  the war started. Is that 

r ight?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Well, the Germ any invaded Poland September
 
1, 1939. Septem ber
 
2 was  m y 
bir thday. That was  when Fr anc e and England gave an ultim atum  to Germ any, whic h Ger many totally 
ignor ed. The following day they dec lared war  on Germ any. And that's when I was  with my m other 
s hopping.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You rec all that. Did your  life change in Belgium  at that point?  The Germans  had not 
yet invaded Belgium, of c ours e, s o.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  No. The next few m onths  they
 
were exc hanging a few s hots  over the bor der, 
between Franc e and Germ any. Until May
 
10, 1940, when Germ any invaded Belgium, Holland, and 
Luxembourg. That's  when the bombs started r aining down.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You rec all that?  That must have been very s
c ar y.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  As  an 11
-
year
-
old, it was n't too s c ar y.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  No?
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  A little bit but not muc h.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I bet your  mom and dad were.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  My father  s ort of expec ted som e of that.

Bets y Anthony:  Did you go to s om e s ort of s helter or into the bas ement or  s omething?

> > Mic hel Margos is :  No, we didn't. Not then.We arr anged as  s oon as poss ible to get out. So we 
pac ked whatever  we c ould. We walked to the r ailr oad s tation and waited f
or a train to c ome. We 
wanted to take one tr ain to the c oas t, going to England. We m is s ed the tr ain. Couldn't get on. The tr ain 

went to the s hip and the s hip we wanted to take was  s unk before we wer e able to tak e it. 
 
 
So we waited a whole night. I r em em be
r  s leeping on the suitc as e. We took  the next train. That 
was  s uppos ed to go to a c ity c alled M
ons
. We got there, the c ity was  c om pletely bom bed out. 
Ever ything was  s topped. They had arres ted two nuns .Well, they wer e dres s ed as nuns  but they were 
ac tually 
Germ an par atrooper s .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Really?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  That delayed ever ything. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony: On your  train there were paratroopers  dr es s ed as  nuns  in habits .
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  I don't know whether they were on the train or in the s tation. At any rate, we 

s tayed on the tr ain and the tr ain kept going for s even day and s even nights  until we got to Southern 
Fr anc e.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And how long would that journey take today, or even in a norm al c ondition at that 

tim e?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is:  Half a day.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  But it took  s even days .
 
>>
 
Mic hel Margos is :  Well, we wer e
 
s tr afed. The tr ain was  bom bed and strafed a c ouple of times. Many 
people don't know what s tr afing means .
 

> > Bets y Anthony:  May be you c an explain it to them .
 
>> Mi
c hel Margos is :  J ust a little air planes c om ing down with their little mac hine gun and just trying to 
c ut the people down.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Was it getting s c ar y for  you then?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  It was  s c ar y. The train s topped a c ouple of tim es . Many people got out of the 
tr ain. My father did not allow us  to get off. He pushed us  under the s eats. Some people who left the 
tr ain could not get back . So we es c aped that one.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And wer e other people on the train als o fleeing, als o refugees ?
 
>> 
Mic hel Margos is :  I ass ume they wer e all r efugees  fr om Belgium.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Bec aus e you s aid or iginally the tr ain s tation itself was  m obbed with people. So lots  
of people in your s ituation tr ying to get out.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Right.
 
> > Bets y Anth
ony:  It mus t have been a ver y tense s ituation.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Very tens e. Som etim es on the s eat, s ometimes in the upper thing, I was  s mall 
enough.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Where the luggage
 
is
?  Yeah.
 
So onc e you wer e for tunate to cr os s into Franc e, at 
th
at time?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  People fed us by thr owing
 
--
 
giving us food thr ough the window. I think  that firs t 
tim e I tasted Fr enc h bread.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Pr etty good?  Yeah.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  We finally made it to Southern Franc e. It was  a s m all town about 5,000. I assume 

the government helped us  to be ther e. Until the Frenc h
 
--
 
the c apital c ountry was  divided between 
oc c upied Fr anc e and unoc c upied Fr anc e.We were in the unocc upied. The c apital bec am e Vic hy. My 

father went ther e to s ee if he c ould
 
get paper s . He had his  own pas s por t. Of c ours e, when war was  
dec lar ed, he was  s tr anded in Switzer land for a couple of weeks before c oming back to Belgium . His  
pas s port expired. My m other's  pass port we wer e on. So he c ouldn't do anything. All the diplomats
 
had 
gone. He felt he had a pric e on his  head so he went to Portugal. He tried to work  for  us fr om Portugal. 

That was  early on
, 
1940.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  As  soon as  the Ger mans c am e into Franc e
 
--
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  J ust as they were c oming, he was  able to es c ape.
 
> > Betsy Anthony:  So you were?

> > Mic hel Margos is :  We wer e s tranded in Fr anc e without paper s, exc ept for  Pers ian pas s por ts.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So that's your m other, you, and two s iblings ?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Two s iblings . The third s ibling died in infanc y year s  ago.
 
 
Fr om ther e we went to a farm . Found friends fr om Rus s ia.We were able to s tay there for a 
while until my m other dec ided that there's  no future staying in the farm. I learned a lot of things  about 
farm ing.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You did?  How long were you there?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Sever al weeks . Took  c are of the c attle, the hors es, the c hicken. I learned how to 

dig for potatoes and c ollec t c orn and dr ive the team  of hors es.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  In just a few weeks ?  That's  great.
 
>> Mi
c hel Margos is :  Drank  milk dir ec tly fr om the c ow.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  The c ow c ould not be pasteur ized, s o.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So from  the farm , then your  m other
 
--
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  My m other dec ided that perhaps
 
--
 
ther e was  a diplomat in Mar s eille. It was  the 
bigges t c ity after Par is. So we dec ided to go there. On the way, we c hanged tr ains
. W
e s topped in 
Toulous e, a big c ity down s outh, too. Ther e was  a little c am p there for welc oming r efugees, a r ec eption 

c enter.We got ther e. They ha
d bunk s  for us . They fed us . But in the m iddle of the night my mother 

didn't feel r ight about staying ther e s o s he lifted the tar p, it was  one of those barr acks with tar ps, and 
we s neaked out.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  J ust s nuck out?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  In the middle of the night we s nuck  out. And from there we went to Mar s eille. I 
found out later thr ough the m us eum, this  mus eum, that the r ec eption c amp was  for people to tak e to 

the way to Ausc hwitz. They wer e c ollec ting thos e people that wer e welc om ed ther e.
 
>>
 
Bets y Anthony:  It was  a trans it c am p in Fr ance wher e Fr enc h J ews  and J ews  in Franc e were 
c ollec ted befor e being then deported to Aus c hwitz.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  My m other had a feeling.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  This  is  pr obably a good time for you to talk  a little bit about your mother. She had a 

lot of r eally good feelings. 
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  I'll talk about it a little later  bec aus e in Mars eille s he did even wor s e
 
--
 
I mean s he 
did even better .
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Even better. Ok . I'll let you
 
get to Mars eille but we'r e going to talk about her  
bec aus e s he's  a really inter esting wom an. 
 
 
So what you're s aying is  that you wer e in this  c amp that you now know would have led you to 
Aus c hwitz and your  mom  just had a feeling, lifted t he tar p and s nuck
 
her kids out and you ran away into 
the night.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  We went to Mar s eille.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  To Mar s eille.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  We found a little r oom just a few bloc k s  fr om  the railroad s tation
, 
whic h I c alled 
the s lums
, 
bec aus e it was  s afe. No cop was willing to go down ther e. Today we c all it ver y diver s e.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  My neighbors wer e opium
-
sm oking Chines e, Arabs, Cor s ic ans , Italians , 
ever ything.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And how wer e you r ec eived in that c ommunity?  Do you rec all?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  As  s oon as  I left
 
Belgium, I pic ked up a Fr enc h Souther n ac c ent and I c ould s peak  
like the natives .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So they thought you wer e a little Frenc h boy.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Yeah. They didn't know the 
differ ence.
 
 
So we s tayed ther e for a while. I bec am e a teenager  ther e.
 
> > Betsy Anthony:  How long wer e you in Mars eille? 
 

6 
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  About two years .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So you r eally did have a c hanc e to s pend tim e there. And your  mother was  ve
r y 
r es ourceful ther e.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Food bec am e s c arc e. Food bec ame r ations . Our doc um ents , the paper, the 

pas s port that we had had expir ed s o we bec am e undoc um ented aliens , to us e m odern term s . So to 
s ur vive m y m other had to do s om ething. She went into her little bus ines s  c alled blac k  marketing.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Right.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Whic h was  ver y r em uner ating bec aus e s he c ould buy things  at a fairly low pric e 

and r esell it at a fair ly good pr ofit.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  What kin
ds  of things did s he sell?
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Foods , eggs, bread.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Things people needed.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Luxur y item s were the m ost pr ofitable
 
--
 
tobac c o, c andies , s weets , pralines , 
anything like that.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Where did 
s he get them from ?
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  I didn't ask her .
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Pr obably wis e.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  I was  not too m uc h in the loop. I was  just a kid.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And then s he s old to other  people liv ing in your  c ommunity or  s pec ific ally to other 

r efugees ? 
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Probably mos t J ews . I know that they had fr iends there bec aus e s he played poker  
with them .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  She did? 
 

> > Mic hel Margos is :  About the only ac tivities  s he probably could affor d.
 
>> Bet
s y Anthony:  I think  you m entioned in your memoir, too, that thes e probably were the only people 
s he c ould really talk to, com munic ate with, bec aus e of the language.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  Well, s he did not speak Frenc h. I like to s ay we were about as  divers e a family as  
c ould be. Firs t
,  
m y parents  wer e born in Russ ia. My s iblings  wer e born in Pers ia. I was  bor n in Belgium. 
My par ents  s poke Yiddish to eac h other, Russ ian to their kids, and we kids s poke Frenc h. That's 

diver s ity within the fam ily . Right?
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Yeah. That's the truth.
 
> > Mic hel Margos is :  So s he c ould
 
--
 
s he never lear ned to s peak  Fr enc h
. Th
e c omm unity in Mar s eille 
was  mos tly J ewish.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So she was  able to s upport you?  Two year s  ther e.

was n't ar ound. Your s iblings wer e off doing their thing. And your father , you didn't s ee him  until three
