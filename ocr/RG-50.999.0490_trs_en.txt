George, or Gyorgy in Hungarian, Pick was born March 28,1934 inBudapest, Hungary to 
Istvan and Margit Pick.  Hungary is highli ghted on thism ap of Europe in 1933.  Istvan was an 
engineer,and Margit was a legal secretary.  Pictured here are Istvanand Margit with their newborn

Af ter Hungary Allied itself with Nazi Germ any, Istvan and Margit losttheir jobsdue to new laws

ing the participation of Jews in the econom y.  Istvan was then conscripted into the Hungarian 
labor battalions. German troopsoccupied Hungary in March 1944, and the Pickfam ily was f irst 

forced tom ove into buildings m arked with theyello w star, like that seen inthis photo. Thatfall, the 
fam ily went into hiding.  But the Pickfam ily was discovered.T he children were taken andGeorge 
was placed ina homewith 500 other children.  George and anotherboy escaped and went back to 
their hiding place, where
 
George was reunited with his parents. T wo weeks later, theentiref am ily 
was sent tothe ghetto.  They were liberatedf rom the ghetto by theSoviets in January 1945.  Inthis

>> Bill Benson:  George, thank you very m uchf or joining us andforyour willingness to beour First 
Persontoday. W e're really glad to have you. You've got so much to share with us in our short hour 
that we shouldprobably just start right away.  
 
 
You were nearly 4
 
1 /2
 
years old when Germ any invaded Poland in Septem ber 1939, when 
W orldW ar II began, and of course, thebrunt of  the war Hungary would come later.  But bef ore we 
turn to that,tell usf irst a little bit about your fam ily and your com munity in the years before the war 
andthe Holocaust.  
 
>> George Pick:  My f am ily's roots go back roughly 230 years in Hungar y.  My great grandparents, 

andeven their parents, were born and raised there. I know a great deal about them.  Just very 
summ arily, I would like to say thatm ost of m y fam ily m em bers were either businessm en orpart of the 
intelligentsia, such as doctors, lawyers, sof orth.

Ourf am ily li ved all over the country.  All of m y grandparents'fam ilies were ver y lar ge, eight, 
nine children,and they have on averagef ive children. Som y extendedfamily was roughly 250 
people at the beginning ofthe war.  
 
 
My f ather, as youm entioned, was an engineer who lost his job when theGreat Depressionhit 
Hungary.  M y grandf ather was able tof ind him  a job, which he kept
 
until January 1, 1939.  When he 
lost it because of the f irst anti
-
Jewish law.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So even bef ore the war began? 
 
>> George Pick:  Before the war began, yes. As am atter off act, Hungary is a ver y
 
--
 
Hungary has a 
ver y unique, perhaps, history in term sof anti
-
Jewish la ws.  T he very firstone was in 1920,two years 
af ter the FirstW orldWar, which was essentially dictating the number of Jewish students in 
universities, in higher education. The Jewish students were overly represented, accor
ding to the 
governm ent,and so becauseof  theethnic makeupof  Hungary, Jews  were roughly 5%.  Sothey 

m ade what they calledthe Num erus Clausus,which essentially said thatonly 5% of the students 
couldbe Jewish.  In certainf aculties, like law andm edicine, they we re over 50%.  That meant that 
90% of the students were kickedout.  Am ong them  was m y uncle, who went to a university in the 
second or third largestcity in Hungary.  He was kickedout
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Because of the laws, right.  
 

>> G e o r g
e Pick:  Because of the laws andbecausehe was Jewish.  He was forced to go abroad.  He 
went to Italy to start allover again.  He was a third
-
year student when they kickedhim out. T henhe 
started, and it tookhim eight years to com plete.

>> B ill B e n s
on:  Because he went abroad to go to school, because of that, that was relatedto your 
m other having to work ?  
 
>> George Pick: T hat's correct.  My m otherwas a couple years younger than he was, and she had to 
go to work.  Shef inished a com mercial school, andf rom  year 16 on she worked.  Mostof her salary 
went to supporther brother in Italy, who hada very hard tim ealso.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, you mentioned thatyour f am ily was ver y large, the extendedf am ily.  
 

>> Ge o rge  P ick:  Righ t.  
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  Your im mediatefam ily, you were the only child. W as there a reasonf or that?  
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. In one word, the Great Depression.  People couldn't afford to have m orethan 
one child. It is not justm y own f am ily, m y own parents,but all m y cousins. I hadf ive cousins; all of 
them  were only children.  Andthen youm entioned I was born in '34.  A few years later whe n the war 
andthe Hitler regim e cam e topower, peoplewere reluctant to have m ore children.  So these were 
the reasons why we ar e
 
a ll s in gle .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Only children, yes.  
 
>> George Pick:  Yes,only children.  Andthat happened, I think,fairly of ten in Hungary.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, again, because thefull bruntof  the war would not really hit Hungary until 
March 1944,70 yearsago, the lives of  Jews, however, in Hungary, c ertainly including Budapest, 
changed signif icantly with the startof  the war.  Tell us what happened inthose years before you were 
actually occupied.

>> George Pick:  OK. 1938 was thef irst year when the Hungarianparliam ent hadessentially voted 
for an anti
-
Jewish law, which was against thecomm ercial interestsof the Jews.  That's where m y 
father lost his job,and m any other thousandsof  Jews.  
 
 
T his law was relativel y " m ild"  because itdid not do anything other than the comm ercial 
problem s.  
 
 
T he second Jewish law, which was less than a year later, in 1939,was m uchmore severe.  
T hef irst one was
 
--
 
it reducedfurtheremploym entf orthe Jews.  Itforbade professionals to practice.  
Je wish  d
octors,for exam ple, could not have but Jewish patients. Jewish la wyers could not practice, 
etc. So italmost destroyed the econom ic resources of the Hungarian Jews.  
 

 
In the second anti
-
Jewi sh law, there was a codicil, addendum , which also said thatpe
ople 
were not trustworthy, and with that the socialDem ocrats, the illegalcommunists and the Jews could 

not serve in the Hungarian Jewish
 
--
 
I m ean, the Hungarian army, but they had special Jewish 
brigades, which were essentially labor brigades.  My f ather was among the very f irst ones to be called 

in, and this was in 1940.  Heand several thousand of them  wenttowork f or the northeastpart of 
Hungary, which was a f reshly reoccupied part of  Hungary.  It was
 
--
 
i t belonged to Rom ania originally, 
but then Hitler and Horthy 
--
  
 

>> Bill Benson:  He was the leader of  Hungary.  
 
>> George Pick: T he leader of  Hungary, agr eedthis shouldbelong to Hungary. W ith Hitler's 
backing, the Hungarians occupiedthis land.My f ather was called up there to build, which e
ssentially 
turned out to be strategic roads toward the Ukraine.  He was therefor three months.  His keepers, the 
people running this, were non
-
Jewish Christian soldiers, but they were very hum ane.  Som y f ather, 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

exceptf or thefact that he was 39 years old and outof  shape, the rest of  them  are like that, and they 
hadtodo very hard physical work.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Building roads? 
 
>> George Pick:  Building roads, yes.  Obviously, it was not within their physique to take it too well, 

butother than that, they were not deprived of food or any kind of things, which was later very 
prevalent in the war.  
 
 
Now, in 1940, I went to my f irstelementary school,as he showed inoneof  your pictures, and 
this was a Jewish school, and with Jewish people. It was an
 
orphanage school, but they had outside 
students com ing here.  I was am ong the outside students. 
 
 
T he sad story, or sad ending of that school was that in 1944, when I was in f ourth grade, 
toward theend of that year the orphans were taken tothe Danubeand were all shot.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he school you hadbeenat?  
 
>> George Pick:  From the school I was at. Along with the teachers.  Sothat was the school.  In 

1942, 1941
-
42,a number of our relatives, wh o lived in Slovakia andAustria had come back 
-- 
or had 
escaped,I should say, to Hungary underf alse papers. T he reason why is because, by 1942, most of 

the Jews in EasternEurope were ghettoized,andthey were starting to be deported to concentration 
anddeath camps. Sothese people were lucky enough to com e,about half  adozen ofm y relatives 
cam e.  One was in Dachau, and Dachau, if  you were rich enough you could sort of buy avisa.  And 
he cam e to Hungary.

Most of these peoplewere, as I mentioned, illegals.  My f am ily hadkept them. They slep
t  in  
different places every night, and we were able tohide them for twoyears, until the Germ ans 
eventually cam e to retrieve them.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Between 1942 and 1944?  
 
>> George Pick:  1944, correct.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that period, did yourf am ily, your parents try to f ind a way to get outof  

Hungary?  
 
>> George Pick: W ell, m y doctoruncle got his degree inItaly.  He cam e back.  Of course,he couldn't 
f ind any jobs.  Andhewas livin g in Budapestfor a couple of  years.T henhe wanted to c
om e to this 
country, and he was able to marry an American citizen.  So he left in 1938.  Hungary was notpart of 

thebelligerence interm s of the war until 1944. T hey were neutral. Som y uncle tried to get us 
papers to come to the United States.  However, the United States Off ice of Foreign Affairsput so 
m any bureaucratic barricades, so to speak, against those who wanted to imm igrate, that we would 
were on the list to imm igrate in 1943, which was a little bit too late, because Hungary was already by 
then
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  He was successful in getting, well, the papers needed to get you to com eto the US
 
--
 
>> Ge o rge  P ick:  Righ t.  
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
--
 
butbecause of the list, bureaucracy and quotas,you would have to wait several 
years?  
 
>> George Pick:  Exactly.  So we got stuck there.  In 1943,m y f ather was recalled again, the second 
tim e .

>> Bill Benson: T o the labor battalion?  
 
>> George Pick: T o the labor battalions, right.  I should say that Hungar y joining Nazi Germ any as an 
ally.  T he Hungarianswere rather reluctant to do any of the hard battles, and Hitler had a hard tim e 
tryin g to convince Horthy and the regionto standupanarm y.  
 
 
Finally, he did,and it was in April of  1942 when that happened,andat thatpoint Jews in labor 
b r i ga
des, between theage of  20and40, were calledup. 50,000 of them.  My father was, fortunately, 
41, so he didn't go into this, but several of m y unclesdid. 
 
 
T hesepeople were taken to the Ukraine, andthey were treated in aver y brutal m anner. They 
we
re there until January of 1943.  At thatpoint, the Russians counter attacked, and the Hungarian 
arm y was wiped out inless than a week, 150,000m en. And roughly 50,000 of  the Jewish slave 
brigade people.  Out of the 50,000, only 5,000 came back.  
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  Of the Jewish labor brigade?  
 
>> George Pick:  Of the Jewish labor.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthey were f orced to goon those laborbattalions, of course, they wer e 

unarm ed, because they were not trustworthy.  
 
>> George Pick:  Absolutely.  
 
>> B
ill Benson: T heywere m adenot only tobuild roads,as yourf ather did, but clearm inefields?  
 
>> George Pick:  Correct.  Correct. T hey clearedm inef ields. In contrast to whatm y f ather 

experienced with his non
-
Jewish arm y, people who were supervising them , they got themost sadistic 
personsto supervise these Jews, and someof  them were told thatyou could come homeas soon as 

the last Jew dies. So it gave them a lot of motivation to kill Jews, and in the mostbrutal way, like

having water sprayed ont
o them atm inus 40degrees weather in Russia, in the Russian winter. Of  
course, theyf roze todeath.  Andbeaten todeath.  As you mentioned they were f orcedto go into 
m inef ields with nothing.  So when they stepped on am ine, they blew up. And they did 
no t  ge t  
suff icientf ood. It was a terribly, terribly horrib le thing.  
 
 
In 1941, the Off ice of Foreign Aff airs also decidedthat those who were not Hungarian citizens 
are going to be deported, taken out of the country.  At thattime, allof  ushave to prove that we were 
third generation Hungarians.  So Ihave a lot of original docum ents, which at that tim epeople 
obtainedto say thattheir great grandf ather
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  You had to prove going back three generations? 
 
>> George Pick: T hree generations, correct. So I have papersof my great grandf athersand 
m others, that they wer e born there and sof orth. Butthose who could not, they were called, roughly 
43,000of  them ,and som e were Hungariansborn in Hungary and soforth,they didn't have tim e to get 
all these docum entations, and they were deported to Galatia in theUkraine andm ostly killed. The 
Hungarians were acting in killing them ,as well as the SS.  Some people came back.  I have som e 
f riends who were there and cam eback,and they were able to somehow survi ve.  But 99%of  the 
people were killed.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, you experienced your own personal real senseof  threat while on a vacation, 

I think in 1943. T ell us about that.  
 
>> George Pick:  Oddenough, mostof  the Jews of  Europe were already dead.  In Hungary, the laws, 

the anti
-
Jewish laws were still relatively tolerant. So we could take a vacation, for exam ple. W edidn't 
live in anyplace except our own apartments. Andm y father,m yself andm y mother went to a vacation

in  t h
e Hungarianm ountains.  W e went toa hotel. T here was noproblem . There were som e hotels 
where Jews were not allowed, but notm any.  And we went to walk the woods when we ran intoa 
group of  thugs who were in blackuniform ,and they were essentially Hungarian Nazis who were 
organizing, yellin g andscream ing anti
-
Sem itic and Nazi slogans.  W e were truly f rightenedby this, 
andtried to get outas soonas we could.  Iforgot thef right when I saw these wild m en, mostly, 

running around, yelling and scream ing
.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hese were m embers of what is known as theArrow C ross?  
 
>> George Pick: T hat's correct, they were m em bers of the Arrow Cross.  Atthat tim e,they were still 
half  illegal, so they wer e meeting inm ountainsides, places where itwas not very obvious.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, you live underthese circum stances, but asyou said, you described it to me 

as it was notas badas it could have been.  But March1944,everyth ing changeddramatically when 
the Germans came in.  Tell us what led up tothe Germansoccupying Hungary, since Hungary had 
been an ally of Germ any, then whatthat meantf or you.  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  Well, occupying is a ver y diff icult word to explain,becausehow doyou 

occupy anally?  T hey did.  The Hungarian governm ent, since1943,were in secret negotiations with 
the Russians andtheEnglish to getoutof  the war.  Howe ver, the Hungarian intelligentsia,which was 
ver y m uch penetratedby the Germ an Gestapo, sothey knew every m ove the Hungarian governm ent 
m ade in secret.  And by March of  1944, when theGermans were beaten already and they're com ing 
back toward the west, this was over a year af ter Stalingrad,they didnot trust the Hungarians really, 
andthey knew that Hungary was a strategic place where they woul d have to have roads to withdraw.

So they came in. Theregent was in am eeting with Hitler, and Hitler dem anded at that tim e 
that roughly 300,000 Hungarian Jews would be given as workers, and they agreed on it. But Hitler 
didn't tell Horthy that while they were in conversation the GermanW ilm ark will occupy Hungary.  T his 
occupationhappened in less than 24 hours, not oneunit,not one Hungarian unit resisted this.  
 
 
So on aSunday, we saw these Germ an tanks rolling into Budapest.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just
 
sort of  waltzed in, no opposition.  
 
>> George Pick:  Noproblem  at all, six or seven divisions cam e in. Af ew days af ter that,Eichmann, 
who was the m an whoran the Jewish affairs at the Gestapo, whohadf ive or six years under his belt 
of  how to round up theJews, and how to deport them  andhow to transport them to these industrial 
scale deathf actories, cam e in with 120 of hisstaff off icers. 120. W e had 825,000 Jews in Hungary, 
the largest
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. Explain that. Because upuntil
 
thatpoint, despite Hungary being such a 
strong ally of  theGermans andthe repressive laws against Jews, there had notbeen them ass 
deportation of Jews, up until that point. 
 
>> George Pick:  Correct. As I said, they had som edeportations, they had some 75,000people, is 

notan insignif icant num ber, of  course, but the bulkof  the Jewish com munity was still there, and that 
was the largest in Europe at thatpoint, roughly 825,000.  
 
 
Despite Hitler's earlier attem pts, the Jews stayed there. But then, wh
en the Germans 
occupied, thef irstpriority was to get these Jews deported.  Now, 125 peopleobviously could not 
deport 800,000people.  However, they had very eager helpers. One of the largest groupsof  eager 
helpers was the gendarm es. Gendarm esessentially ran the countryside.

Ever ybody hated them.  T hey hatedthe Jews worse.  
 
 
Here was this large gr oup of people, who were eager helpers in getting the Jews roundedup, 
concentrated in ghettos, and very shortly deported. Now, bef ore this happened, there were maybe 

100 laws, restricti ve laws which cam eoutalm osta dozen aday, such as you cannothave a

if  you 
are a Jew, you cannothave a bicycle, a radio, a telephone.  You cannot travel on the railroads.  All 

these restrictive things.  So we had lost contact with all our relatives who li ved in the countryside.  So 
we didn't know what was going on. 
 
 
W hat was going on was, f rom them iddleof April they were concentrated in these ghettos, 
som e of  which were brutal.  They were sm allareas,brickf actories out under the sunand them oon, 
andthey had nof ood. By the m iddleof  May, they startedtodeport people in a massive wa y, roughl y 
12,000a day.  12,000a day. T his wasf our large train loads, cattletrain loadsf ullof  people. T hey 
robbed them of everyt hing bef ore they led them  into thetrain. Children, women,m en.

Mostly in Auschwitz. W ithin two hoursof  arrival, they were 
already dead,and essentially crem ated.T here was a case where so many people were there, so 
m any people had to be crem ated, thatone of the crem atorium s blew up,because it just couldn't

W edidn't know anything about this, because the Hungariannewspapers 
didn't let us know about this.  
 
 
W elived in Budapest,andmy father, infactall m enf rom 20 to60, were again recalled to slave 
labor.  My father and his unit went to the western edgeof  Hungary, building def ensive positions.  
 
 
So only them en, the old men, womenand children were in Budapest. T hen in June, we we re 
told that we have tomove outof  our place and move into what we called a starredhouse.You saw a

and 4:00 in the af ternoon.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Between 2:00 and 4:00 wasyour only opportunity to go out andf indfood,then not 
available to you very often?

rolled around, mostof  the food was gone, becauseother people.  
 
 
W elived in a house which was essentially a lockedhouse,and 20% of  thepopulation of 
Budapest were Jews, andonly 5% of the livi ng space
 
was allocated.  Sof rom  20 to 5, they were 
really concentrating them .  
 
 
Eachbuilding was closed during the curf ew.  One Christianf am ily li ved there. Inour case, 
there was a Christianfam ily by the nam e of Varga.  He was a long

saved lives.

Day happened in June,and by theend of  June, 
beginning of  July actually, they had enough air power over Europe that they could reach Budapest.  
 
 
On the 2ndof  July there was a carpet bombing with a thousandbombers, and we were sitting 
in the bunker,and we heardthese awful explosionsall around us,for three hours. W e didn't think 
that we would survive it.  W e did.

with m e.  Eventoday I get startled when there is anunexpectednoise.  But for 35 years, I couldn't 
sleep withoutthe pillow over m y head.  And I sleepnow with earplugs, actually.  That staye
d  with  m e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because the bombing was constant therefor aperiod of tim e.  
 
>> George Pick:  For three hours,and by the tim e we got out it was30% of the city was in ruins.  So 
Horthy got them essage from  the air.  He also got the message
 
f rom cables, which cam e from the 
pope, Roosevelt and Churchill and others, that this was just thef irst tasteof  destruction, if he's not 

going to stop his wartim e activities andhis deportationof  the Jews.  
 
 
At the sam e time, theArrow Cross party wanted to have a coupagainst him, and3,000of  the 
gendarmes were in Budapest, ready to deport us. Sothef irst part was to somehow neutralize them . 

Andof  the30 Hungarian divisions, only onewas loyal to Horthy.  Thatone came to Budapeston 
Horthy's orders, and they were able to neutralize these gendarmes andmake it impossiblefor them  to 
takeover the government. In July.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In July of 1944.  
 
>> George Pick:  Later they took over the government.  But this gave us three months of essent
ia lly 
"f reedom " or window of  survi val.  
 
 
Meanwhile, m y father, in August, was brought back to Budapest, which was lucky.  He came 
home alm ost every night illegally.  Mr.
 
Varga l et him  in, which was illegal.  He spent afew hours with 
us, and then he went back to his unit. T his wentonfor afew weeks .  
 
 
T henon October 15, this was after the Rom aniansalready switched sides and they were 
f ighting againstthe Hungarians and the Germans,on theSoviet side, they were also Alliesof

G e r m an y b ef o r e.  They h a
d apowerf ularm y, and they had been able toessentially catch a half  
m illion Germ ans in that area. 
 
 
So in October, which was way too late, Horthy m adea declaration on the radio stating that 
Hungary is going to be a neutral country, we are not going to f ightfor or against anybody.  Of course, 
that was justanempty gesture, because intwo hours the HungarianNazis took over, and in four or 
f ive days Eichm ann cam e backand deportations started.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T o com plete what hadbeenstopped in July
 
af ter the bom bing?  
 
>> George Pick:  Exactly.  First thing was, the week af ter he cam e back was to roundup10,000 
young wom en. T wo of m y aunts were among them . And they were deportedand oneof my aunts 
died. Then they started the deportationsf rom  the outskirts of Budapest. T hat was thef irst thing.  
T hen they sort of cam e in closer and closer to the center.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you saidearlier, they had already completely elim inated the countryside, the rural 

areas,of  all Jews, almost ahalf m illion. Now Eichmann's game plan is to get rid of the last remaining 
numbers in Budapest.  
 
>> George Pick:  Yes.W hich were about 120, 130,000. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his is happening while Germ any is losing the war.  It's almost overf or them .  
 
>> George Pick: W ell, so much so that the Soviet forces weref ighting about 100m ilesf rom  

Budapest already.  They diverted resources to deport the Jews, and roughly 50,000 Jews were 
deportedf rom Budapest.  Am ong them  would have beenm y father. My f ather's unit commander was 
a very decent guy.  He had af iance who

>> Bill Benson:  Before they were going to beshipped out, they get 24
-
hour furlough?  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  The message was, of  course, if  you want to or try to go somewhere, don't 
com e back.  Idon't know how m any people cam e back, butm y father was not among them ,because 
m y f a t h e
r was trying to f inda place to hide.  
 
 
He went toa non
-
Jewishf riend, who was a businesspartner duringthe1930s and1940s. My 
father worked, though illegall y, but worked asa businessm an.  And so thisman told him
 
--
 
or  ga ve  
him  an address, and told himto go there, which was notfarf rom  this place.  It's in ablue
-
co lla r 
neighborhood, sortof  a neighborhood wherethey had smallf actories and so forth. 
 
 
So he sent him  to af actory, which was a textilef actory.  Allegedly, they were m aking unif orm s 
for the Hungarianarm y.  In reality, it was essentially a hiding placefor Jews.  I still have thepieceof  
paper which shows that m y f ather was a worker there, atextile work er in this factory, which had all 
sorts of  stam pson it.  
 
 
So,for all externalpurposes, this was a high
-
priority f actory. T hey had roughly 60or 70men 
who, just like m yf ather, were able to runaway and hide, who had som ebody who knew som ebody 
who sent them  there. 
 
 
T hena coupleof  weeks later, we got anotef rom m y father. W edidn't know where m y father 
was until then.  Andhis note said to imm ediately com e to this placewhere he is. This note was 
delivered by a Hungarian soldier, which turned out to be a Hungarian soldier who was already him self  
was an illegal.

My m other was ver y reluctant, because she had her mother and three aunts living in the sam e 
place. Butf inally, she decided that we have to go. T he story is longer, and we don't have the tim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantour audience to really understand that.T his is a f actory in theopenthat is 
producing unif orm sf orthearm y.  All the workers, and even the guards, are, in reality, all hidden 
people.  
 
>> George Pick:  Correct.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Posing as guards. T o the outside world it is afunctioningf actory in the comm unity.  
You're hiding in the absolute open.

went in, because in the ver y next m orning ourbuilding was raided,and were taken tothis transit 
cam p in preparationfor deportation.  
 
 
At that tim e, there were no cattle cars anym ore.  People had to walk 200 kilometers,160 miles 
roughly.  If  they couldn't do it, they were shot.  
 
 
Mr.
 
Varga,f irst of all, how did he save our lives in, m y mother's andm ine?  By the time we 
were ready to leave, it was af ter curf ew. W e took off our yellow stars , 
a nd  Mr.
 
Varga let us out.  T hat 
was thef irst thing.  
 
 
Secondly, when we f inally got to thefactory and settled down there,by then there were roughly

Varga, as I 
m entioned, who knew the fam ily, calledanuncle, m y mother's uncle, who was already in what they 
called an international ghetto. International ghetto consisted of
 
buildings which were nom inally under 
the controlof  theSwedes, the Swiss, theSpanish and Portuguese and the Vatican. These were 

houses where they we re ableto concentrateJews and nom inally ga ve them a pieceof  paper saying 
thatthey're under their con

Varga that his sisters are to be about deported. SohecalledW allenberg, who's picture 
you can see upstairs.  He was a Swedish diplom at, andhe was able to do something about 

deportees.  And hispeople went there, and pulledm y great

aunts and grandm other out and brought 
them  into this special building where they survived.  
 

 
S o  Mr.
 
Varga, o

Varga, f ive people of  m y f am ily had escaped.

m ind, if  you would tell us thef actory you wer e hidden in, of course,was eventually denou
nced, and 
tell us where you went f rom  there, including when you wentto theorphanage, then what you went 

through during the siege of Budapest.  
 
>> George Pick:  OK. W hat happened,on December2 is that our hiding place was betrayed by a 

m an who was trustedby this organization, who ran not only our hiding place butthree others.  And 
the Hungarian Gestapo cam e in. W e thought we were f inished, becausethey had submachine guns,

they separated menf rom  women,and they actedas if  we were going to be immediately massacred 
there.  
 
 
Fortunately, they were not stupid.  It's December. T he Russians are 20m iles f rom Budapest.  
So they were taking a big bribe and saying, OK, now you are OK. You are underour protection, and 

if  youhave aproblem  just call such

a nd

such number.  
 
 
A couple of days later,the leadership of thisplace where we stayeddecided that20 children 
outof  the170, 20 more childrenf rom  6m onths oldall the way to 10, I was one of the older ones, we 
would be betteroff and safer if  we went
 
toanorphanage, which was under the protection of theSwiss 
Red Cross. So the soldier, we hada little lorry there, and horse,took us to thisplace, whic h was right 

in the m iddleof  the city.  T his orphanage had500orphans,and when we got thereI had
 
a terrible 
feeling. T hesepoor little kids were starving, were dirty, were cr ying, 35 in the room .  
 
 
So af riend of m ine and I, same age,f rom the sam e group, decided we would escape.T he 
next m orning,of  course, the door was closed, and the next m orningwe stood behind the door, andas 

it opened a young wom an cam e in. W e said we have som e money, and we are very hungry, which 
was true, incidentally, and we wantedto goout to buy som efood, and would she escort us?  
 
She said she would. And she did.  But we ran away f rom her. And we ranback to where we were 

hiding.  
 
 
T wo weeks later, two policem en showed upand told us that the Nazi party is aware thatthis is 
af alse place, and that Jews are hiding, and they are readyf ora raid, where they would n
ot ask any 
questions,they would just kill everybody.  But by thena ghetto wasestablished in them iddle of

Budapest, sm all ghetto, 1/10th of a squarem ile. T hey hadalready 70,000 people there. Like 20, 30 
people per room .  
 
 
T hey told usthat inorder
 
to

they are there to essentially take us there. T hey didn't say, but 
ever ybody understoodthat whoever was another hiding place couldgo, and they're not going to do 
anything.  
 
 
So we started out 170; we ended up 65 in the ghetto. T he restof  them disappeared.  
 
 
So we got intothe ghetto.  My father was
 
--
 
he volunteeredf orthe ghettopolice, which m eant 
thathehad twice as muchfood aseverybody else did. T he ghettopolice there hada different 

m ission than all the ghettopolice in all of Europe. W herethe ghetto police essentially cooperated 
with the Germ ans, here the ghetto police's m ission was to try to save the Jews.  For that,they got a 
nightstick and aberet, against Nazis who cam e in with submachine guns.  
 
 
My f ather lost three of his partners. T hey wer e walking on the streets.  On Christm as Day 
1944, the siege,the actual siege of Budapestbegan with heavy artil l ery f ire.  Althoughthere was 
food, the deposits in the ghetto nobody volunteeredto go therebecause the snipersf rom  the va
rious 
buildings, plusthe shells, could kill people very easily.  So f rom essentially the beginning of January 
until the Soviets came, we didn't eat.  
 
 
W elived in a house where they had a lot of old Jewish people.  Most of  themdiedof  starvation

not ready to die, but expecting todie. Then, all of a

T here was a sm all window slit, and
 
we looked up, and we couldn't see thepeople there, but what we 
could see was the shoes or the boots they wore. T hey were not Nazi boots. We knew wh at the Nazi 

boots looked like.T hey were different, so we f igured probably it was theSoviets.  
 
 
Nobody
 
cam e down to the bunker.  And a few hours later, m y father decided that he should 
see what's going on. We wentout, and we decided to gohom e, back to where we were thrown out.

declared that the Jews were agents of

neither tolerated anti

Se
m itism  nor was in alliance with thefar right neo
-
Nazi party, which i s legal in 
Hungary.  Yet, rather than easing thesefears, it has turned intoamockery of the tragedy it was 
m eant to solemnly rem em ber.  
 
 
A statue was erected in the m iddleof Budapest,
 
with Hungary as the archangel Gabriel and 
Germ any as af iendish eagle swooping downand victim izing the Hungarians.  
 
 
T he activists, not just Jews, m any others, took m atters into their hands and erected a living 
m em orial to the victim s of the Holocaust. 
 
Hundreds of shoes, candles, stones,photographs of  
m urdered grandparents, letters, poem s and the presence of com m ittedprotestors were there.  And 

the terrible thing is that Hungarian anti
-
Sem itism  is very diff erent f rom  theW estern European 
anti

S em it is m
.  
 
T here is an ingrained hatred in society of  Hungar y thatfueled the Holocaustand that still 
denies that the Holocaust happened,or thatHungarians were, in any way, culpable.  Hungarian 

society is now clim axin g toward a neo
-
Nazi attitude towards thef ew Jews that still live there.  
 
 
I would like toask you som ething, Inever asked an audiencebefore.  You can Google 
Hungarian em bassy.  Please, please send aletter and tell them that this is unacceptable in the21st 
century, that a country which was activel y involved in the Holocaustnow is sliding back into the same 
kind of mentality which caused that Holocaust.
