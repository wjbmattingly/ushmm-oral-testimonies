Question: This is a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Vera Glasberg
, conducted today by 
Judy Cohen
, on January 7
th
, 2009, in the 
home of Mrs. 
Glasberg 
in
 Alexandria, Virginia.
 I thought that we could start by 
just telling us something ab out your earl
y childhood, where you were born, where 
you grew up. 
Answer: Well, I was b o rn in 
Riga
, which at the time of my
 birth, wh ich is 1912, 
was still 
R u ssia.
 It is today an in dependent co untry, 
Latv ia
. I don™t remember
 Riga
 
at all because my parents moved to
 Kiev, 
which then was also
 Russia,
 became later 
Ukraine
, when I was about one year
 old. Av  Œ we™ll th Œ 
Kiev 
I remember very 
well. We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a Œ a Œ a sizable 

apartment. When Œ in 1
917, wh en the revolution broke out, and th e Œ the 
communists were Œ how should  I say Œ assi
gning free rooms and apartments to their 
memb ers, my  parents decided to  rent thei
r apartment themselves. A nd there was an 
Italian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl Œ her 

little daughter was my playmate
. And I have very good se
ven years from that time. 
The theater gave sometimes
 operas for children, like 
Sad Sultan
, or 
The Cock 
Door, 
and 
The Golden Cockerel. 
And through this, the mother of my little friend
 
Annata
(ph), we sometimes got seats to go an
d see these operas. In addition, she 
was getting ballet dances Œ lessons, and so
 I got them myself also; my parents

thought it would be a good id
ea. It was a wonderful time 
for me as a child. For my  
parents it was mu ch more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds. My  
father was arrested once for no reason 
except that he was a capitalist. And 
fortunately he was released twice when he
 was arrested. But in
 the meantime, there 
was, for instance, no water. 
And my  mo ther had sometimes to go in the middle of 
the night when it was announc
ed that there was some wa
ter somewhere in another 
quarter. And she would carry Œ co me home carrying two pails of water for Œ for 
food and for washing. I was not aware of all these hardships. But after he Œ my 

father was released for the second time fr
om prison, he said, no mo re, I want out. I 
won™t stay. 

Q: So tell us something about the experien
ces that Œ where you left, why you left, 
how you left.  

A: Well, that™s where he got a Œ and a Œ 
kind of a Œ edificial assignment to go for a 
job which was a Œ a fake job, to  
Rig a
 fo r two years. That™s why he was Œ we were 
able to leave the country legally. He coul
d take his fami ly, and take belongings 
necessary for a two year stay. However, 
the trip was mo st unusual. We were 
traveling in a train with cattle cars. We we
re sitting on the floor. We were part of a 
group of, if I recall, three or four fam
ilies, which little Œ we all had little stoves, 
kerosene little stoves. The tr
ain would stop every once in 
awhile in the middle of 
the field that Œ that was Œ that Œ 
[break] 
Q: Okay , let™s continue. So, tell me abou
t the car, the rail car that you went to. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

A: The rail car was a cattle car, there were 
no seats. We were sitting on the floor, on 
hay, or whatever it was. And it was very 
primitive. The tri Œ the trip must have 
taken at least a week, if not more. And 
it would stop Œ the train would stop in th e 
middle of the field, and we were all Œ were
 sucha Œ su Œ you kno
w, supposed  to get 
out to refresh ourselves w
ith the snow, it was in winter, in January. We had little 
kerosene stoves. We made water out of
 the snow for tea. Everybody had, 
apparently , food with  us. I don™t have any 
reco llection of being 
Œ of famine. But it 
was extremely primitive and I thought it th
e most exciting adve
nture you can think 
of. So, all my recollections of that time, wh
ich for Œ for adults were very taxing, for 
me were great fun. In
 Riga
 we had family. My mother 
Œ my mother™s uncle was a 
psychiatrist who had a mental
 institution, which was the 
institution of the city. And 
Œ but we were not permitted Œ I mean, we Œ 
I speak of me as a child Œ to even go 
near it. The house where the family lived 
was in a big Œ how should I say it Œ estate, 
completely separated, and that was where 
the family lived. Coul
dn™t see it at th e 
institution, even thou
gh the Œ the windows. And then
 again, there was one of the 
women who was helping in  th
e household, had a daughter 
Ludiczka
(ph). And 
Ludiczka
(ph) was my  playmate, again I had one
 friend, I never missed friends. So, 
I had a wonderful time. We st
ayed there until spring, and af
ter Œ after that, my Œ my 
uncle on my father™s side, had in 
Finland
 Œ also, he was a wealthy man, had a big 
estate in
 Finland
, and the whole family of the 
Hessens
(ph), wh ich is
 my  ma id en  
name, were reunited there on the Œ on the fa
rm. There there were chickens and two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

horses. I was someti mes permitt e d  to go on 
the chariot with the 
Œ with the horseman 
to bring somebody to the train station thro
ugh the woods. It was w o nderful. There 
was a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my 
playmate, and we went fishing in th
e lake and canoeing, and so fo rth. 

Q: But, I understand you di
dn™t stay there that long? 
A: No, it Œ we were invited, we were th
e guests for the summert
ime. And then my  
father went to 
Danzig
 where the same brother had the insurance comp any of the 
fleet on the 
Volga
. You see the Œ it was the Œ well, see family and my father 
directed the office in
 Danzig
. My mother and I 
went Œ stayed in 
Berlin, 
because 
first we Œ the whole family went to 
Berlin
 and my father left. And my mother and I 
stayed. We had rented  a room
 in the apartment of a thea
ter critic. And he always Œ 
his wife was not in good health, and he used
 to always to take my mother to first 
shows in the theaters in 
Berlin
, which at the time, in the 20s
 at that time, was in full 
swing. And I was attended Œ was in Œ regist
ered for the first ti
me in my life to a 
school, because until then I wa
s home tutored, both in 
Russia
 and in Œ in
 Riga
, 
always I had home tutors. 
Q: So tell me, what was it like as a young 
girl, as a refugee? By
 then you had lived, 
actually in four different countrie
s for varyin g lengths of time.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: How did you adapt to all 
these changing circumstances? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

A: Until then it was no problem. It was 
always something exciting, new and 
wonderful. For the first decep
tion for me was when we left
 Berlin
 and joined my 
father in dan Œ in 
So pot, 
which is a little town, a sea re
sort actually, attendant to 
Danzig
. It is the distance like from 
Alexandria, Virginia
 to
 Wa shington, D.C.
 It is 
just attendant, but it is on th e 
No rth
 Sea and a Œ a sea resort by the next Œ 
Poland
, 
which is practically next door. So , dur
ing the summer season it was invaded by the 
Polish 
[indecipherable]
 community which cam
e to play in the 
cansino
(ph) and so 
forth. But I went to a German 
lycée,
 which was a good school, but I hated it, 
because after the Russian school, which wa
s on a very high level, the faculty was 
the cream cup of faculty from 
Russia
, émigrés from 
Russia
, whereas here there 
were Œ how should I define it? Only wo
men, only old spin
sters, anti-Semitic, 
unfriendly. Very resenting the Œ the Œ the 
additions that came, and made probab ly 
their job difficult, because my German wa
s practically nil. And my marks at th e 
beginning were awful. I didn™t learn German 
grammar, it was terrible. I had to write 
a composition, it was full of mistakes. It took me time. 
Q: So was there Œ was their attitude to 
you more disdainful because you were a 
immigrant who didn™t know German, or Œ 

A: Yeah, of course. 

Q: Œ or do you think it was Œ 
A: They went a Œ 
Q: Œ you mentioned the anti-Semi tism,  h-how Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
8
 
 
A: That they were to begin with. That Œbecause to there at that time already many 
refugees from 
Russia
 who got kind of squeezed in 
there. And they were Œ they 
didn™t like Œ it was a different culture. Th
ey were very narrow-
minded, they were 
very Œ you know, like 
little towns. Whereas 
Russia
, from
 Russia
 people came from 
Saint Petersburg, 
from
 Kiev
, from 
Moscow
. It was a different type of families. 
Q: And how did you respond to  that? 
A: Well, you know, at that age, you just suffer. 
Q: Right. 

A: What can you do, you don™t have to 
revolt. However, you know, there too we 
had nice times. I made friends 
with Œ with  these people from 
Russia
, of course. And 
we went in Œ for instance once, to make an
 experience, and to  write a note in several 
languages, which we got toge
ther, and put the Œ the note
, with my address because 
th Œ I had invented that, so ha-happens, in a bottle. We sealed it and we threw the 
bottle into the sea, and later compl etelyforgot about it, even though a few months 
later we got a real Œ an answer from somebo Œ students in 
Sweden
. 
Q: What language did they write back in? 
A: They wrote in Œ I Œ if I rememb er 
correctly, in German. 
Broken German. And 
they offered to correspond 
before we get together, but our parents, our commo n 
parents said to us, it™s na Œ not a good id
ea, because they were students already, 19 
years old, we were 12. So Œ so  it was not
 th e th in g  to  do. A nd  w e  ob ey ed . Th ere 
was no revolt. Parents said, that was it. Bu
t it Œ it was a nice Œ it was a nice time. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

had man Œ lifelong friends from that time. We
 had comp etitions wh
o would be the fi 
Œ the first one would 
g Œ win who will go and 
take the first cold swim in the spring, 
and without interruption until the fall. You 
see, children™s play, it was a good time. 
And yeah, I lived there for Œ yeah, I 
would say for almo st five years.  
Q: At the time you left, if someone was to
 ask how you identifie
d yourself, did you 
still think of yourself as a Russian
 émigré, or were
 you thinking Œ 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Although, at Œ by th at time Œ  by that time we were no longer 
officially Russians, because we never got 
back, as it was understood. So we loos Œ 
lost the citizenship. We were at that point
 citizens of no countr
y. We didn™t belong, 
we had no protection from any country . A
nd a me mb er of the then League of 
Nations, by the name of 
Nansen
(ph) has created for people like my  family, a 
special document which was called the 
Na nsen
(ph) passport, wh ich was not Œ 
didn™t look like a passport of a regular co
untry, wh ich was a sheet of paper with  
some name , date of birth, indication Œ all 
the information that the passport has. But 

that was our passport, and fo rever gave us 
trouble, because usually the people at the 
casa Œ the borders had never seen such documents. 
Q: Do you remember what st
age your family got these? 
When they were living in 
Sopot
 already, or Œ 
A: Yeah. When we had to leave, you kno
w, to Œ to cross a border. For instance, 
once or twice my mother and I from 
Berlin
 c ame to  th e su mme
r for to visit my 
father in da Œ in
 So po t
. T h e 
Poland
 refused to even accept this document as a d o c Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
10
 
 
official document. So the car in whic
h we were traveling was sealed, buco Œ 
because Œ in order to get from 
[dog ba rking]
 
Berlin
 to 
So po t
, we had to cross two 
borders, you know, to enter the 
Poland
, and exit to the
 Pola nd.
 God forbid we 
should get out, you 
see. Sealed car. 
Christina?
 
[indecipherable]
 my thoughts. Q: 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, I was telling you that we were Œ we had to go through
 Poland
 in sealed 
cars. And wherever later we moved from 
Sopot
 finally, the Œ the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 the 
Volga
, I don™t Œ I cannot tell you what exactly happened, 
either the office closed or my father had 
no other possibilities. He was offered a job 
in 
Brussels,
 in
 Belgium. 
A job wh ich Œ my  father had 
tw o docto rates, he was an 
engineer from 
Belgium
 and he had a docto rate of mathematics from 
Saint 
Petersburg
, with a gold medal. But he accepted the job to sell off used cars in Œ in 
Belgium
, just to show you that permutation saved their lives. They  never 
complained, never.  

Q: And how old were you wh
en  you made the move to 
Belgium
? 
A: Well, I was elated pa Œ by that 
time I was 17.And to
 Œ leaving this 
Sopot
, this 
small town and go to  
Brussels,
 the capital of 
Belgium
 in the west, it was very 
exciting. I was 17, but I still had to sw
itch school because I didn't finish the
 lycée. 
I 
had two Œ the aptitude to make 
[indecipherable]. 
I had to have the pre Œ 
untaprima
(ph) and 
dobaprima
(ph). And each time I had to change languages; 
from Russian first to German; 
from German then to French
. The French that I have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
11
 
 
learned in school was nothing. So Œ well, we arrived in 
Belgium,
 and what can I 
say? Very soon after my father arrived th
ere, maybe a year, the Œ the Œ the garage 
with the used car collapsed. Well, by that time, when I finished the 
lycée
, which 
corresponds years Œ to tw
o years of college, the 
[indecipherable]
 is 
bachot,
 Fren ch  
bachot
 you know what that means? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It is a different organiza
tion of schools. I knew that I 
had to help th
e Œ with Œ the 
family with finances. So I registered in 
a business school and I decided I™m going to 
continue my education at this first opportunity, and did it through
out my life. I went 

to business school for six months. By that
 time it was su mmer, and one luxury that 
my mother permitted herself, wa
s to once a year to go to 
Riga
 to visit her mother. 
So while she was away, it so happ
ened that the t-touring club of
 Belgium
, which is 
like the ma Œ automobile association here
, was looking fo r somebody for a memb er 
of their staff. And they usually request 
that somebo Œ to send them somebody the 
busin ess school wh ere Œ that I was attending
. And before I even had finished it, the 
director of the school picked me to ask me
 if I was interested. Was I interested? Of 
course. So I have Œ was very
 proud that I got the job be
fore my mother came home. 
So that was my le
ngthy period in 
Brussels
, until May 10
th
, 1940. 
Q: That means before then though,
 that while you were living in 
Brussels 
corresponded to the time that 
Hitler
 had come into power in 
Germ any
, and later on 
the invasion of 
Poland,
 before that the annexation of 
Czechoslovakia
. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
12
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were these events that you were follo
wing at all? Did you ever think that it 
would reach western 
Euro pe
, or was it far d istant news? 
A: Well, you Œ it Œ it was Œ it was Œ how 
sh ould I say? Nobody could imagine what 
could d Œ that something of that caliber 
could ever happen to begin with. On  the 
other hand, I must also confess, to my sh
ame, that at that tim
e I was a very Œ how 
should I say Œ carefree, cheerful, a little b
it superficial girl wh
o loved dancing, who 
loved friendships, excu
rsions. Politics were n o t my strength. My husband, if I had 
met him that Œ that area, we would have 
never seen each other again, because he 
was very much involved in
 politics. He was active in 
the labor Zionist movement, 
very active. So, it is funny, we lived in 
the same town for 10 y
ears, both of us, had 
many common friends, and never met.  

Q: So let™s then move to the day, May 10
th
, 1940. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What are your recollections of that 
day, and wh at was the response of your 

family? 
A: That day Œ that day was a sunny, be
autiful morning and we r Œ I remember 
waking up and couldn't understa
nd. I thought that it was a thunderstorm. And the Œ 
how is possible, the skis Œ sky is blue. 
And all these explosions, c-could it be a 
thunderstorm? So, it™s Œ it was very stra
nge. But then  of course, word came out 
immediately. I went to work , everybody we
nt to work , and fo r us, very soon people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
13
 
 
started Œ as soon as people understood th at it is the Germans who are invading, 
those who had cars and funds, st
arted moving, moving south. 
Q: And did your family leave 
immediately, or did they Œ 
A: No, not at all. 

Q: Œ debate at all? 

A: Not at all because we had no means Œ th
e little means that we had, it is only very 
recently before the invasion th
at we moved to our own apar
tment, we used tohave 
rented rooms before, at our house. My pare
nts lived in the attic
 and I lived in the 
little Œ small, little attendant room downst
airs, it was very Œ really, it was my 
mo ther who managed everything remarkably
 well. They shared the kitchen, we 
shared the bathroom. It was 
very, very difficult life for 
them, and again, not very 
much for me. For me it was a
ll a very easy going Œ so, wh
at I was going to say that 
the big ex pense that we have made the Œ before May 10
th
, maybe before the one 
May fifth, is to buy a Œ I cannot say a refri
gerator because it was not electric. It was 
a cold box, you know, with pi
eces of ice. And here if the war breaks out, the day 
when that ice thing was deliv
ered. So Œ but, I must say 
that the president of the 
touring club, who was an unus
ual person, told  me, because one, I was a fit Œ I think 
I was the only Jewish person in  the staff 
Œ don™t stay. Whether you have means or 
not, take wh at you can carry and leave. Ta
ke the first train and go south. Go  to
 
Paris
 and see what you can do later. And what
 he said was Œ was very meaningful 
to my  parents, too. So, after two or
 three days, that™s what we did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
14
 
 
Q: Did you have any trouble leaving 
Belgium
 at that point? 
A: Yes, because after Œ when we were 
almost at the French border, there was a 
bombard ment at night, and they  broke the ra
ils, the train couldn™t continue. It so 
happened  th e train had stopped at the sta
tion, so we left the Œ the one or two 
suitcases that we had at the station,
 and continued on foot, going south. 
Q: Were you carrying any luggag
e with you at all? Just Œ 
A: A handbag, just a handbag. 
Q: Clothes on your back? 

A: Yeah, clothes on the back and the little 
te Œ suitcase. Strange
ly enough Œ fate is 
strange Œ we met good friends of ours, and th
e wife of Œ it was actually a friend of 
my  husband, but I knew her vaguely, too. 
She had the French passport, she was of 
French origin, and there was 
a train forming, but only for 
French citizens. So here 
she was, 
Mimi
 was her name, 
Mimi
 was running to the train and waving her 
passport. Her husband and the th ree of us
, my parents and I after her, and then 
nobody checked the documents or tickets, 
nothing. In the car Œ again a cattle car. 
Again that™s everything clos
ed, totally dark. Was crazy. 
Q: And then  wh ere did the train take you? 

A: The train took us to
 Paris
, and there we were welcom
ed by the Red Cross with 
coffee, the Germans will never get here, you
™re welcome, blah, blah, blah. So there 
we separated from our friends, and we ha Œ 
we had family, my father had family in 
Paris
. So  Œ but of course, we couldn™t stay 
there, we stayed 
overn ight, but they  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
15
 
 
couldn™t put up three people. And that wa
s announced that people who can support 
themselves can take a train that will be 
forming the next day.
 One will be going to 
Toulouse,
 and the other to
 Bordeaux, 
south. By mere chance, we chose 
Toulouse
.  
Q: Tell me about 
To ulo u se
. 
A: 
Toulouse.
 It is called 
la ville de violette.
 The violet city. It is charming, but 
actually, it is an industrial city. The Œ there 
is a Œ an enormous factory for airplanes. 
This enormous new airplane, 
this monster is being built 
there, is being finished 
there. But it has a certain charm, and some
 cultural life, certain interesting things 
that we couldn™t think abou
t that very much. And we 
met so me fri e
nds from Œ from 
Brussels
. Nobody wa Œ knew where to go, no
body had means to go to a hotel. We 
bought a paper and saw that there was a house for rent, an empty house for rent, and 
we decided to Œ to get Œ to
 pull together and rent this house and live there as a 
community. 
Q: Who are these friends? 
A: These friends were tw
o Russian families. One 
[indecipherable]
 I mean, the Œ 
the adults of that family are already gone, 
but the s Œ one of the sons of our friends, 
who was 14 year olds when I got married fin a
lly, in this house, visits me here n o w. 
He is an 80 year old friend, and I have 
known him, of course, forever. And another 
family. So Œ and we Œ it was well organized
. We made a whole government there, 
there was a so-called president. My father 
was the minister of agriculture, because it 
was a little garden that we planted vegetables.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
16
 
 
Q: And what a Œ who were the other mi
nisters, what were the other jobs? 
A: There was a foreign minister, was running 
every day to all the consulates to find 
out where you can leave 
again, because at that time that part of 
France
 was not 
occupied, was free. B u t y
ou never know. And it was later. Then there was a 
minister of the interior, th
at was my mo ther, who was in charge of th e househ old. 
She int Œ the Œ the mother of this
 young man I just described and 
[indecipherable]
 
minister interior, then Œ th
en th ere was the young generation, the supplies, because 
we had to  run around and find supplies, 
as I told you. There was no butter, there 

was no milk, there was Œ as time progressed, very difficu lt. 
Q: And I understand it wasn™t just the three 
families, that other people came as well.  
A: Oh, my  goodness. Word  came around th at
 there is such a co
mmunity that exists 
and there were forever people appeari
ng at the door. Some people some people 
knew, and some people who didn™t know any
body, we just heard ab out it. And there 
were always a meal, an d there were always
 a shelter overnight. Some stayed for one 
night, some stayed for a w
eek. Some stayed wh en  they  had fu rther visas, some  
others not. It was amazing.  

Q: How did you make the rations last for so many people? 
A: Well, as I say, everybody contributed, 
energy, effort, and k
nowl Œ not everybody 
did everything. Everyb
ody had their decided needs. I-I 
had a friend, this young man 
André
 would lend me his bicycle, and we 
would go to  the country and buy some 
eggs here, and a little, I don™t know, cream th ere, or 
crème fraîche
, or something 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

like that. And the younger on
es, after dinner did the dishes. The low Œ the ladies Œ 
the mothers were cooking, and the 
younger generation did the dishes.  
Q: And did the 
Vichy
 government interfere at all, or did Œ 
A: No, there were Œ there were, as I say, 
there were Œ they didn™t mind. There was Œ 
after all, we were contributing in a way to 
the Œ to the life of the city by buying, and 
behaving, and it was paying the rent and so
 forth. So Œ and th
en people, by and by, 
began to leave. And that™s how very good
 friends of ours who came Œ who came to 
Œ to Œ to  say goodbye, brang s Œ brought some 
[indecipherable]
 just said, we™re 
going to  go to a house, there were go Œ a 
house of nice peoples, come along. But 
that particular time I di
dn™t pay mu ch attention to 
Sam,
 because the president of the 
touring club of 
Belg ium
 also arrived in the 
[indeciphera ble]
 because he was 
looking for his son who was a colonel in th
e Belgian Army . And he had learned that 
in
 Montpelier, 
which is halfway between 
Toulo u se
 and 
Marseilles, 
there were lists 
of Belgian officers. And he asked me to
 come along with him. He Œ I think my  
parents would have let 
me only with Colonel 
Mitey
(ph) to Œ to leave 
Toulouse
 by 
train, but he had the diplom
atic passport, and then my  
[indecipherable]
 passport 
picture is Œ was 
[indecipherable]
 that I was secretary of so and so. So I could 
always travel with him withou
t effort, without difficulties. 
Q: But then I understand that you met 
Sam 
again shortly afterwards? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Why don™t you talk
 Œ tell that story? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
18
 
 
A: Well, I was running somewhere and I met 
Sam 
in  the street, and we stopped and 
chatted for a minute. And he asked me if I 
happened to be free the next day, th at he 
is going to visit some frie
nds, and they™re going to  make
 mu sic to play, and he was 
going to  sing. And to  me it sounded as if he
 asked me to Œ I don™t know, to fly to 
Mars, because everybody aski
ng only in which consulate th
at you go. And so that 
was nice. And th en he told me about the pl
ans to organize this farm, this kibbutz.  
Q: Tell me about the farm. 
A: Well, the farm, he got funds from the la
bor Zionists to rent a Œ all this was his 
idea, he rented an old castle, was ratherdilapidated. But it was beautiful, it was a 
castle, really, and surrounding 
grounds with woods and plai
ns. And enough funds to 
have some cattle, goats and cows, and a hors
e, and what else? Chickens galore and 
turkey, you name it. A nd mos
tly his idea was just becaus
e the soldiers that I told 
you were gone, people who ha
d no means of support and were Œ I mean, they were 
not mishandled in any way, 
but they were not free, in
 Gurs. 
You know what 
Gurs
 
is. 
Q: Right. 
A: They came to work on the farm. 
Q: How did he get them out of 
Gu rs
 and to the farm? 
A: Because he announced in
 Gurs
 that there are Œ there are 
jobs needed on Œ on Œ in 
Gaillard.
 That there is a means Œ there is 
Œ they planted Œ I don™t Œ I don™t 
remember what they planted. I was only 
paperwork wo rker. I occasionally visited 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
19
 
 
there after that, of course, but that
 was at Œ about 20 miles from Œ from 
Toulouse, 
not far. And Œ and so it was to everybody™s satisfaction that 
Sam
 was terrific, he 
always knew how to  Œ people are tired, wo
rked very hard, ther
e was not much food. 
But still, they Œ they knew it™s a matter 
of life and death, literally, because you 
know, you never know what happens tomo rro
w. In fact, it did happen finally, they 
were occupied.  
Q: Did you keep up with the people, the 
other ones on the farm? Do you know what 
h a pp en ed ? 
A: After we left? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, they became a center of resistance
, yeah. They were Œ 
they were Œ they 
were Œ they were good people, yeah . 

Q: And I Œ do you rememb er a
nything mo re about Œ were 
they refugees, were they 
from Œ mostly German Jews, or 
[indeciphera ble]
 Jews? 
A: No, they were not Œ there were some
 German, there were some P o lish. There 
were some that were still from 
Belgium
 also. There were not so many. There would 
be Œ I would guess that there was maybe 25 - 30 people, not mo re. So me of them 

Sam 
knew personally, 
Sam, 
he was Œ he was reading th
e references and so he 
wanted Œ he wanted a homog
en ous group and not quarrels and you know Œ and it 
worked. It really did. 

Q: What type of activities did people do wh
en they weren™t busy
 planting the crops? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
20
 
 
A: What they were doing? 
Q: Yeah, for relaxation. Did they have Œ 
A: They were collapsing to sleep, I assure you. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: They didn™t know Œ ther
e was no television, and th ere was no Œ but, you see, I 
reme mb er one ev ening at Œ that sticks 
always in my memory. The winter was 
approaching and needed wo od for Œ for he
ating and fo r cooking and for ever, and it 
was low. It had to be done, there wa
s no time during the day, and after dinner 
everybody was tired. So
 Sa m
, already at the dinnertime,
 he began saying Œ hello 
Becca
. 
R: Hi Nana. 

A: This is my granddaughter 
Rebecca. 
R: Hi, nice to meet you. 
A: You don™t mind? 
Q: No. 

A: Okay . 
Q: All right. 
A: So, he said, look, it™s ni
ce evening, let™s go out, make
 a tour and sing. Take a 
long some Œ how do you call it, t h e Œ 
Q: Axes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
21
 
 
A: Axes. We went out singi
ng, and on th e way with  axes
, came b ack with tons of 
wood, and everybody was a good mood,
 ex hausted and tired, still did. 
Q: What type of paperw ork were yo
u doing? Was this accounting, or Œ 
A: Well, at the beginning we needed a lo
t of permissions forms and all that. And 
once the farm was organized, there was no n
eed for it, you see. So it was Œ it was Œ 
it was functioning very well. And if occasi
onally there was a need for a letter that 
was Œ he became friends with the mayor 
Œ who married us, by th e way Œ the mayor 
of that little village, was called 
Grenard
(ph). And he Œ at that time there was no Œ 
no gas, and nobody had a car 
except the Œ the personalities. So the mayor rent us his 

car to drive from
 Deymarie
(ph) to the 
Chateau de Gaillard.
 And my  parents and 
the witnesses followed all in a horse pulled cart Œ cattle. 
Q: So let™s step back a b
it, the wedding, when did
 Sam 
propose, how Œ and tell me 
about the wedding day. 
A: Well, I came to visit
 Sam
 in
 Gaillard
 for Œ over the new year. And that™s when 
he gave me the ring that had belonged to
 his mo ther, becaus
e nobody bought any 
gown s or rings or any th ings of that sort
. And that ring has an interesting story. 
Much, much later, when this
 young lady was getting married
, I decided to give her 
the ring of my  husband™s mo ther. And to 
my horro r, I had been away, it had been 
stolen. I had a break-in in my  house. Bu
t we worked it out anyway, there was 
another ring. So  Œ yeah. 
Q: So, was Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
22
 
 
A: I went Œ I went to 
Gaillard
 over Œ yeah , overn ight, and 
you see, later the ladies 
told me Œ the ladies of 
[indecipherable]
 told me they 
[indecipherable]
 and to the 
big fancy hall in the gi Œ in the castle, wh
ich had been the bull hall, because it had 
tapestries, they were moth-e
aten, but they were beautiful
 tapestries. He went in 
there, he said, that™s where I™m going to
 get married. I d idn™t even know it.  
Q: So, it was a time of rationing, 
of shortages, but you still had a Œ 
A: I have only good remembrance of that 
time. I really have nothing sad, where it 
was so difficult for most people, and I must say 
[music playing] 
there goes my 
phone.
 Becca
, do you Œ can you give
 it to me. Excuse Œ 
Q: We™ll cut Œ pause. 
[break] 

A: Œ occasionally, I™m sorry. 

Q: That™s okay. So you were telli
ng a little bit about the wedding day. 
A: So, th e f Œ we had two wedding days
. The first was a civil wedding in this 
village of 
Grenard
(ph). As I said, the mayor married 
us, and he Œ heh-
heh Œ that is 
very French, he said, in ou
r country, the one who married has the first kiss. So he 
embraced me. And, as I say, he lent us
 his motorcar. We were like princes of 
Œ
 
Sam
 
and I. And my  parents and my  witnesses 
followed in a horse drawn Œ how do you 
call it, the place when you put
 in hay? They were sitti
ng Œ it was not for people, 
they didn™t need 
that for people. 
Q: A wagon? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
23
 
 
A: Wagon, yeah. Anyway, we arrived in Œ 
and then there was a festive reception in
 
Gaillard
, and we had chickens and the ducks 
and the goats, little goats, all that 
mixing with  the people in the reception. It
 was most unusual. And then, the next day 
we had a re Œ a religious wedding from a rabbi who came to the house to be 

[indecipherable]
 and married us there. And I 
think in  the book th ere is a 
photograph of it, where all the pe
ople who at that time were in the 
[indecipherable]
 
many more came. And they 
made it wonderful, and for those times, that was a 
dinner, that was a feast. So Œ and yeah, 
now, the only thing was, I had no clothes. 
The wedding was in the same 
suit that I wore coming from
 Brussels
. On the road, 
in the trains, everywhere. But for the wedd
in g at home, I had to wear something a 
little more presentable, but I didn™t have 
any. So a friend of 
mine happened to pass 
by, and we had similar figur
es, she lent me a d ress. 
Q: I understand that once you got married, 
you weren't Œ you were
 still separated for 
a while. 

A: Yeah, yeah, because since we were goi
ng to leave the followi
ng Œ and Œ and very 
soon, I wanted to stay 
with my  parents. And 
Sam 
returned to the farm. So we saw 
each other for weekends here and there, but
 I didn™t want to go and live on the farm. 
Q: So tell me, you were talking about you 
were going to be l
eaving. Ho w did you 
get a visa to get out? 
A: He had a visa to get out wh en I met him, from Rabbi
 stat Œ Stephen Weiss. 
Q: Had he ever met Rabbi
 Weiss
 before? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
24
 
 
A: I don™t know, I don™t 
think so. But he knew of 
Sa m 
because he work ed very Œ 
was very active in the labor Zionist organization in 
Belgiu m.
 So
 Sam 
had this visa 
Œ he, as a matter of fact, had 
already used the entrance to 
Palestine, 
but he had 
given it to somebody else. My children 
ask me sometime s, why didn™t he go to 
Palestine
, why did he go to  the 
United Sta tes
? I cannot answer that, I don™t know. 
He probably had reasons for it. One though
 that comes t o  my mind is that his 
parents were alive. His father, rather. Hi
s mother was already 
gone. And he was Œ 
he was Œ he needed su pport, financial supp
ort, and that, of course, was not possible 
from 
Palestine
, because people went there to 
dig roads, and to build. And 
Sam 
wanted to  get a job and su-support hi
s father, and that™s what he did. 
Q: So you had the visa, was Œ 
A: So Œ 

Q: Œ there a time expiration on it, or Œ 
A: Well, that was the interes
ting thing. We both went to 
Marseille
 from the 
honeymoon, to extend th e visa for two. 
And the American cons
ul asked us, do you 
want a tourist visa or an 
immigration visa? Who cares?
 You know, is that we™ll 
come back to 
Euro pe
 anyway after the war is over 
tomorrow afternoon. Whatever 
you give us, we™ll be grateful. And this
 man did something th at I much later 
understood. He was forbidden to  give out i
mmigration visas, and he
 did, he gave us 
one.  
Q: Do you know who 
signed fo r your visa? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
25
 
 
A: I never knew, f Œ and y
ou know, I don™t remember the name. I wish that it Œ 
because I understand that some of them we
re Œ there were seve
ral consuls who were 
doing it, and they were demo ted. And somebo
dy told me even th
at one of them a 
stamp was done in his honor, because he re
ally was deported or fired altogeth er 
because he helped so  
many Jews to escape. 
Q: Can you describe what the scene wa
s like at the American consulate in 
Marseille
? I se Œ were there crowds of people 
[indecipherable]
 you just Œ 
A: No, not at all. 
Q: Œ walk ed in, no? 
A: Yeah, yeah. No crowds, no. Be right there 
[indecipherable]
 no, because people 
were dying to get a visa, but you could only
 get one if you had the permission to get 
out of 
France
, and proof that you have visas to
 get thro ugh th e countries you have 
to get Œ to get there. Whic
h on the other one Œ on the 
other hand, were difficult to 
get without the v Œ en d visa. 
Q: So how did you get 
your transit visas? 
A: Well, you see, some  Œ some people got 
stuck on the way, like for instance in 
Cuba
. We know a friend who 
s Œ well, got stuck in 
Cuba
. Couldn™t Œ had to wait Œ 
waiting for the American visa. We had no 
problem once we had to  prove that the 
emergency visa was official. 
We got Œ we went through 
Spain
 and 
Portugal
 and 
took a boat to 
Lisbon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
26
 
 
Q: So describe what the process was like leav ing
 France, 
going through 
Spa in
, any 
difficulties you encountered? 
A: We sure did, we sure did. Well, we left
 Œ we left early August, I think. It was Œ it 
was very difficult for me to leave,
 although th e arrangement was that 
Sam
 and I 
would go Œ we had no money,
 practically no money, an d 
the trip was paid by the 
HIAS
 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know, he said 
[indecipherable]
 
HIAS
 would takes 
care, but it was paid for us. And we would 
get organized and a year later my  parents 
were to join us in the 
States
. We left in ™41, in August 
™41, they were to come in 
™42. 

Q: Did your parents have visas? 
A: No. But once we were there, th
ere was, you know, we were in the
 States
, there 
should be no problem in find
ing, you know, for parents to
 join, close relatives that 
would have been no mo re. And that™s 
what happened, ev entu ally. I went to 
Washin gton
 for an affidavit, got it right away. 
Q: So describe crossing the bord er into 
Spain
 Œ 
A: Well, yeah Œ 
Q: Œ crossing th e border into 
Portugal. 
A: We left by train. There were friends
 on the way, in the mountains, near 
Po
(ph), 
which is near the Spanish border. We had 
some friends who came out to see the 
train pass and wave to us. Th
ey couldn™t see us, of course, but we saw them. On the 
train we me t a Spaniard, a charmi ng fellow. We are going to  spend a night in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
27
 
 
Madrid
. Wh en he heard that we were s-st
opping Œ he was coming back after the 
tour or army, he said, 
I™m going to show you 
Madrid
, and took us Œ 
he went home, 
took a shower and s Œ kissed his wife and came out again, met us at the hotel and 
took us around in
 Madrid
. It was really very nice, yeah . So  Œ but the Œ the Œ th e Œ 
the real event was at the border between 
Spa in
 and 
Lisbon
, because that was 
actually for the first time entering the freedom, because 
Lisbon, Portugal
 was a 
neutral country. 
Spa in
 was still fascist, it was still allied of 
Germany
, but 
Portugal
 
was free. S o , this is the last border, en
trance into freedom. Th
ey took our luggage, 
and made us open th e luggag e and took our 
passports. The train is about to leave in 
two minutes, everything is ready, we were
 going to have some
 sandwich and relax. 
Enters the official and says, lady, off the 
train. What? My  husband can contin ue, but 
I have to get off. So 
Sam 
told me it makes no sense for us both to stick here. I will 
go, and th ere™s only one train a day Œ 
Q: And when was your ship leaving? 
A: The next day. The next day. And one 
train a day. That he
 told me, call the 
[indecipherable]
 immediately, call the police, 
call whoever you can do, you will 
co me to mo rro w. 

Q: Why did they take you off the train? 

A: They took me off the train because as 
Sam™s
 wife, I was listed as a Polish 
citizen, and I had the 
Na nsen
(ph) pass that they never se
en in their life. Something 
was not right, and during wartime, you don
™t play. And there was no time to make 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
28
 
 
decisions or make calls. So here was th
e train leaving with my newly wedded 
husband, and th e ship leaving th e next day. 
I didn™t Œ I don™t remember crying, but I 
must have been because late
r I realized that my cheeks were wet. And the same 
official came and said, don™t cry. Let hi
m go. You™ll get married, you™ll stay here. 
He was actually very  nice. 
Q: So how did you st
raighten it all out? 
A: I did call the 
[indecipherable]
 and they  Œ and when
 Sa m 
arrived they 
straightened it out, the matter of Œ of 
the papers. And I took th e next train, 
Sam 
met 
me at the station. We took a taxi, which 
was a luxury, but I needed  inoculation for 
smallpox. And we literally got to the boat 
50 minutes before they
 put up Œ pulled up 
the planks, yeah. Yeah. 
Q: I understand that they 
Œ once you were on the ship 
though, you had some better 
luck. 
A: On th e ship we had better luck. I se
e you rememb er and you know. Yes, it was 
amazing. The Œ the leader of the 
[indeciphera ble]
 group to Œ wh ich had paid our 
passage, 
Sam
 introduced him to me. And he came
 back and asked me if I knew how 
to type. Well, I was deep in thoughts 
about leaving my  parents and the whole 
country and the continent of 
Europe
, and th at was very advantageo us because they 
doubled Œ that would double
 our fortune; 25 dollars in those years was like 250 
now. And Œ and we were to
 eat in first class. And 
I, without my  husband, would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
29
 
 
share the Œ a stateroom with another lady, 
and he was in the hold, where we were 
supposed to stay. 
Q: That™s not in the book. 
A: He didn™t mind. So that™s what happ
ened, tha-that was fun too, because they 
were very nice Portuguese officers, nice
, friendly, handsome. And I was work ing 
three hours a day, and people on Œ on Œ on
 the ship saw that I was member of the 
staff. So that was great 
fun. And we arrived in
 Staten  Island
 on September 2
nd
, 
1940, Labor Day. And the ship stood in  the 
Œ in the harbor, they
 didn™t take us on 
board  because it was Labor Day. And you see those lights of 
Ma nh a t ta n
, it was 
gorgeous. So  it went. 

Q: So yes Œ so, well the time you were in
 New York
 during the war, were you able 
to correspond with yo
ur parents at all? 
A: Yes, because my mother
 was working for the Swiss
 
Red Cross, we were able to 
correspond through the Red Cross 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Through the whole war, or Œ 

A: No, th e beginning. I would say maybe for Œ 
for half of the time, if at all. Maybe 
five, six months. But th ey were saying mont
hs, years, couple of years. About half of 
the time we were separated was Œ was actually fifti Œ yeah, five years. My parents 

arrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended. 
Q: How did you discover they were still alive? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
30
 
 
A: That was interestin g. My mother met 
in the street an American soldier, and 
asked him to send me a note from them by Œ 
how is it called, the American special 
way for the soldiers? Do 
you know wh at that i Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 mail? 
A: Huh? 

Q: To mail 
APO. 
A: Yeah, 
AP O 
mail. So I got one day a letter fro
m the soldier, with regards from 
my parents. Was fantastic, because th-t
he Œ the regular mail didn™t work yet. 
Q: Did your parents share mu
ch about how th
ey  su rv iv ed ? 
A: You know, it™s strange. They
 never liked to talk about 
it. All I know, that they 
went underground. All I know that they had 
false papers. All I know that they were 
at the beginning hidden by a fami ly wh ere 
I had the Œ the gall to tutor a woman in 
English, who kind of took a liking to 
me and with my imperfect knowledge, she 
said it was useful for her. So I was tuto
ring some people who were Œ wanted to  
come to the 
States
. And she help ed out. I don™t kn
ow much, but they
 survived. You 
know, there were many French 
heroes who hid Jews. Yeah. 
Q: Now, I know that you and 
Sam
, once you got the 
States 
durin g those, you know, 
four years when  
it was still war. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Both of you, in different ways, were
 working to get visas for people who were 
still over there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561 
31
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Can you talk ab
out that at all? 
A: No Œ yeah.
 Sam
 did it personally because h-he 
Œ he Œ during his work still in 
Brussel
 had many co ntacts here and th ere. And th en there were the strangest 

coincidences. One day Œ we liv
ed then at th
e corner of 
Bro adway
 and 110
th
 Street, 
he came down in to the subway  and saw a 
ma n who was visibly 
just arrived, who 
was kind of looking around 
a little bit lost. And he came
 up to him, he could see 
that he was a Jew who arrived recently. 
You know, there are certain signs you 
recognize. He came up and asked him in Yi
ddish wh ether he could help him. Oh 
yes, said, I need to go to
 Times Squa re
, I don™t know which train to take. And 
Sa m
 
said, well, I™m going in the same d irection, 
I™ll Œ I™ll help you to 
get there. So they 
take the train together, then 
Sam
 asked him, where are Œ when  did you arrive? I 
arrived yesterday. Wh ere do 
you come from?
 I come from 
Toulouse.
 Really? So, 
can I help you in  any way? He said, well, 
[indecipherable]
 There is a man I have to 
look up first. His name is
 Samuel Glasberg
. Could you believe it? In 
New York,
 in 
the subway of 
New York,
 yeah. 
Q: A fantastic story. 

A: Yeah, it is a fantastic story. 

Q: And you were also
 working though for 
[indecipherable]
 recipes? 
A: Well, I Œ yeah. You see, there Œ I men

[indecipherable]
. I never met his wife, but the very evening when we arrived in
 
New York
 and went to the family where I to
ld you the young ma
n who comes still, 
who is now 80 years old, he got stuck in 
Cuba
. His wife, I don™t know by what 
means, you know, th e information gets ar
ound fast. The very same evening, she 
called me at the house wher
e were Œ landed. And said, 
Vera, 
we never met. B u t I 
know that you arrived, and I know you. 
I™m working for a am
er Œ for a Russian 
lawyer, who heads an American affidavit 
committee for people for Russian refugees 
Œ not refugees, for Russian Œ 
how should I say it, call it? Intellectuals who are stuck, 
who have no families, a
nd need to get out of 
Euro pe.
 She didn™t ask me if I was 
interested, she told me, to
mo rrow I come to meet you, 
I™m going introduce you to 
this man, and you are taking over my
 job, because I need to go to 
Cuba
, to my  
husband. And th at™s exactly what happened
. The next day I had th e job. My  job 
consisted in visiting wealthy 
American families, rec Œ expl
aining to them that their 
responsib ility was only to sign the forms, 
that they are goi
ng to  guarantee the 
finances of the family. They
 Œ an d the promise, honest promise of the committee 
that it will never have to do
 it actually, that it is just a formality. And fill out the 
forms for them. 

Q: Do you know how many families 
they succeeded in getting out of 
Europe
 that 
way? 
A: Oh, many, many. I work ed th ere for a couple of years, many. Yes, I cannot give 
you the numb er really, but many. I would sa
y in the dozens, yeah. Yes, people were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

Œ were very Œ there were people who were 
Œ you know, th-the Œ 
maybe not now, or 
maybe some other later, didn™t work. But mo st
 people, wh en they  heard that it is a 
beautiful 
[indeciphera ble]
. It was not I who was the Œ it is my  boss, of course, who 
was the ma n of standing, whose wo rd gua
ranteed, you know, he Œ he was a Œ a Œ 
Alexis
(ph) 
Goldenweiser
(ph) was his name. He was a Russian lawyer, a man of 
very high standing. And 
it was wonderful to work  
for him, wonderful.  
Q: How long did that job last? 
A: Until my daughter was born. Yeah, and 
even after she was born, we were n Œ 

living not far from each other, I would go
 and pick up work and I had a Œ a 
typewriter at home, and continued work ing. 
Q: So they were able to get pe
ople out throughout the whole war? 
A: I Œ I would say so, yeah. 

Q: It Œ before we end Œ at what
 point, once you™re living in  the 
United States
, did 
the full horrors of what was going on in 
Europe
 become apparent? You left 
France
 
before the Germans took over at
 Vichy. 
A: Correct, correct. 
Q: So, when did the information come to
 you? Do you remember th at moment? 
A: I mu st say that the Œ the beginning of
 it, I Œ I was unable to believe it, like 
everybody else. It was so atrocious and 
so unthinkable. How can you believe these 

things? One thought it is Œ it is, you know, 
that people were 
going mad, and Œ but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0561

when , I cannot describe it. Like everybody 
else. It was horrible to Œ to Œ to  even 
think. 
Q: And
 Sam,
 was he able to correspond 
with his father at all? 
A: Unfo rtunately, very soon he Œ he wa
s not hearing from him any mo re. He didn™t 
want to leave 
Poland, 
couldn™t. His mo ther was no longer alive, and he was a very 
good son. But it became impossible to corre
spond, yeah. And there again, you see, 
it™s only then for me it became interesting 
to learn mo re about Judaism, about Œ we 
discussed many things before we got married, and it was, by the way, it was 

understood that the Jewish education was in 
Sam™s
 hands. And what can I say? It™s 
Œ it was a Œ again, a period in a different wa
y, which was so happy in my  life. My Œ 

my  husband, who was wonderful. My children 
who were my Œ my greatest wish to 
have. And the difficulties didn™t mean anythi
ng. The Œ the Œ the baby difficults. We 
didn™t even have a phone in the house. Wh
en  I needed a docto r I had to go nine 
floors down  and send call from the general ph
one, but he never could call me b ack 
if he was busy. It didn™t matter. I had to 
wash the diap ers by my  Œ by hands and dry 
them on the roof. Didn™t matter. It was 
wonderful, wonderful time. And th en they  
ad Œ ha Œ on the other hand, also I wa
s Œ there was a time when I didn™t know 
whether my  parents are dead or alive. Imag
ine the joy to know th
at they are there. 
Q: Before we conclude thi
ngs, why don™t you just desc
ribe the day your parents 
arrived in the 
United States
?

A: Oh, I must say, my mother arrived, sh
e Œ when  she arrived Œ when they arrived, 
she was 56 years old, still a young woman. 
To me she looked an elderly lady. She 
was well dressed, she had Œ yeah , I mu st
 tell you that befo
re coming to the 
United 
States
, my parents returned to
 Belgium
 to say farewell. And that was the president 
of the touring club who kept some pr
ecious pieces that th
ey brought out of 
Russia
, 
in his house, and another friend of mine. A
nd so they  wanted to
 bring it with them 
for my  household. And now I 
have given all these beautiful pieces to my  children, 
to
 Vic, 
and now my  daughter wh o was here took 
the last, that I gave her a beautiful 
silver tray. And I think that
 my mother, all this she ca
rried, although I don™t know 
how she managed to bring it out, and my  fa
ther. So, to me she seemed an elderly Œ 
my  goodness, can you imag
ine? That is the age 
[indecipherable]
 older than my  
daughter. So, I never thought that I will liv
e that long, of course. And Œ but she 
looked wonderful and we were
, of course, very moved. And, I mu st say, from one 
day to another, you know, we b
ecame a family of six. I had 
to go to Œ ba
ck to work. 
My mother took 
over the household, th
e two children. It is amazing. When I think 
back now, I don™t know how 
she did it. She handled ever
ything with again, with 
grace. Never complained, never. And neithe
r did my father. They did what they 
could, the best they could, somehow su
cceeded and never complained. That™s one 
thing I learned from th
em, not to complain. 
Q: That™s a wonderful lesson in life 
A: Yeah.

United Sta tes
