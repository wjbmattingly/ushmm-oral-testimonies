ear
ly, at the age

, obviousl y, i n a hospital, but we lived in 
, where m y father was some kind of a official for the Polish arm y, or so.

rm y?
 
A: Yes.

 or 
Kiev
, in that area. And Œ and she was a registered nurse, and of 

course, during the Œ in 
Poland 
she didn™t work, because m y father is an officer, 
made very good salary. As a matter of fact, we had a full ti me servant, and he had Œ

he Œ he had Œ and we had the part t i me servant , and he had the orderly. Later, dis-
discontinued orderly, but at one ti me, each officer had a Œ 

Q: Had an orderly. 

A: Yeah, that™s right, so Œ 

Q:Oka y. Howdo you say orderly inPoli sh?
 
A: 
Ordyna ns
. 
Q: Oka y, because anot her interview that I had this week, somebody was talking 

about an 
o rdyna ns

Ukra ine
.  
A: Yeah.

)
 or 
Kiev
. And your father as well, or Œ 
A: Yes, that™s right . 

Q: So the y all came from t he east, then. 

A: 
Vinnytsia
 or somet hing like t hat. As a mat ter of fact, his parents probably were

Stalin
, because a lot of people from that area, 
Vinnytsia
, 

)
, 
Kiev
, were deported.  
Q: You mean jer Œ before the worl d war Œ world Œ World War II?

Q: Did he have any communicati on with his family? Because you were in 
Poland
, 
and Œ 
A: Not really, not reall y
, th 
Œ the only communication, he was writing the Polish 
consulate in Œ in Œ in Œ about Œ asking about some of his papers, but I don™t Œ I 

didn™t see any post cards from Œ from his parents, so it, of course, when 
Bolsheviks 

took it over, probably i-if you are sending lett ers, they probably t hrew it in a round 

file. The circle file. 

Q: So, did he talk much about his underground activities during World War I? 
A: Well,he wasn™t the braggingtype,h
e just mention here and there, and he took 
part in a Œ i n a Œ in a f Œ a fight against the 
Bolsheviks
 i n 1920, and 
Poland 
defeated 
them, and Œ 

Q: So he was part of that battle? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
11
 
A: And he really Œ in 
Poland
, somehow government didn™t like people who got 
education i n Tsarist  
Russia
. The y rather lean t oward the people who were under 
Austria
 or 
Prussi a
. 

Q: Why?
 
A: And he was Œ he was a graduate of the Œ 
Q:Russian West Point.
 
A: Yes. Wi th the number one Œ 
Q: Certificate? 

A: Yes. So Œ well, lik
e in manypolitics
, t here™s no like to Œ those people were too 

smart. 

Q: Yeah, that™s true. Do you know the name of this milit ary academy that was in 

Russia
?  
A: Not really. Probably 
Kiev
 military academ y or somet hing. I probably could dig 
out from Œ 
from s
ome of the papers that I have here, because at one t ime I was 
thinking about getting a lawyer and trying to Œ 
because my grandparents
 had a big, 

big, big landowners 
they were
, around 
Vinnytsia
. And one of the guy from Serbi an 

society, he went to 
Ukraine
 
ab
out  five, 10 years ago, and the y paid him for his 
house which he had over there. Except he couldn™t take money fr-from 
Ukraine
, so 
he got to leave it to his aunt, or something. 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
12
 
Q: So you™re thinking about reparati ons, about 
you some 
Œ  
A: But you know, it™s getting late. I™m 85 now. Another month I™l l be 86, so Œ 
Q: Well, congratulations, happy birthda y. You Œ so your grandparents were 

landowners?  

A: Yes. 
Q: And the y had two sons, your father and his brother? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And so did bot h of them finish higher education? 

A: Oh, the one was the doctor, so evidently he Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and he had to finish it in Œ in 
Russi a
, yeah. And ri Œ  

Q: And did the y have girls? I™m sorry, I int errupted you. You Œ 
I 
Œ were they the 
only two boys, or were there more children in t hat family? 
A: That™s what I am aware of, because I haven™t discuss it with my father, but I 

know for sure that hi m and his brother, because he lived i n same t own. And when 

the Russians came, he didn™t visi t us be Œ for the obvious reasons. 

Q: Of course, of course. Tell me a l ittle bit about your mother™s famil y. Were they 

also landowners? 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
13
 
A: That Œ I don™t know too much about m y m other™s fami ly, but evidently they were 
well-to-
do, because she 
Œ she graduated as a registered nurse. At t he ti me it was like 
at the university, at that level. So evidently, you Œ the y could afford to send her, you 

know, to Œ  for her education. So evidently they were doing oka y. 

Q: And was her family also in this 
Vinnytsia
 - 
Kiev
 
area?
 
A: Evidently so, because you know, when the Œ 
my
 father and the y met, so that t he y 
had to be someplace in the area. 

Q: Which 
Œ  which 
to me suggests that 
Œ did you know any of her famil y members? 
It sounds l ike you didn Œ you wouldn™t have had the chance to do so. 
A: No, there was a elderl y woman that used to live with us. She was a part of m y 

mother™s family, but I don™t know what was her relationship to Œ 
to my grandparents 
there. But she lived wit h us, about  95 when she died. 
Q: I see. Oka y. But this is also unusual for the people that I™ve talked to, that so 
much of your parent s™ fami lies were on the other side of the border. And that that  

border was closed, you know, during the 1920s, and the 1930s. Most people had 

their families around them. The larger famili es. Did you Œ before World War II, did 

you visit with your doctor uncle much? Did you see each ot her often? 

A: Oh yes, the y used to come over to our house, we used to go to their house. And 

by the wa y, we were doing much better to hear that he™s 
a doctor.
 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
14
 
Q: Well, if your father was a high ranking officer, that would Œ that would make 
sense. 

A: Yeah, so it Œ but Œ but yeah, we were visiting quite often, I mean, at least once or 

every couple months, yeah. 

Q: Did he have chil dren? 
A: No, the y didn™t . They didn™t have. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: He was in a concent ration camp, as was 
Lil lian
, m y sister, but she came back to 
Poland
 and got a Œ tuberculosis, and she died from that. 

Q: Tell me a little bit about her story, before we go into your own st ory. 
Lillian
 
lived in 
Warsaw
?  
A: Yes. While 
she was attendingt h
e university. 
Q: Oka y, and that was when Œ that was in the late 1930s? 
A: Yes, 30 Œ ™39 Œ ™38 - 
™39, yeah.
 
Q: She would have been then, 25, 26 years old? 

A: Something like that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And what was she studying? 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
15
 
A: I thought she wanted to be a doctor. 
Q: Oka y. And what happened to her when the war started? 

A: Well, war started on the first of September. My moth Œ m y mother didn™t feel too 

good, so she came over to 
Kovel
. And she was in 
Kovel
 on the 29
th
 of August. And 
m y father was beggi ng her, sa ys, listen, st a y here. War is going to break out any 
time. She sa ys, the y need me over t here, I bel ong to many organizati ons there, 
they™re going to need me there, and she went back to 
Warsaw
. 
Q: I see. And then what happened to her? 

A: And then, sh Œ sh Œ after they destroyed 
Warsaw
, she Œ she wound up in a Œ in Œ 
in a concentration cam p. 

Q: Well, do you know what kind of activities she was involved in? 

A: All those Œ for example, Free 
Poland
, and stuff like that, see? 
Q: Was she part of 
Armia Kryova
, or you don™t know? 

A: That I don™t know. I don™t want  to give somet hing that I™m not sure of. 

Q: Oka y. Was she involved in underground activities, then? Resistance activities?  

A: Well, we didn™t have too much correspondence dur-during the war. 

Q: Of course not. 

A: No. 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
16
 
Q: I™m talking after the war, when Œ did you find out her story? Did you find out 
about her st ory? 

A: Well, we were looki ng for her through Red Cross and everythi ng, and 
Warsaw
 
was destroyed 80 percent. But finally we found her, and she lived in the same house 

what she di d before the war. 
Q: My goodness. 
A: In 
) 
. 
)
 wasn™t destroyed that much. So she lived there, and she 
was working in the bank at that time, under Œ under communist 
Poland
, she worked 
the bank. 

Q: And when you Œ okay, when you found her, what year was that? 

A: Probably it was ™47. 

Q: Oka y. Did you see her, did you visit her?  
A: No, no, oy Œ in those da ys you couldn™t  go to Œ 
Q: No, of course not. 

A: Œ to 
Pol and
. 
Q: So, did you ever meet her again?  

A: No. 

Q: After 1939, when she left 
Kovel
, and went back to 
Warsaw
, no one ever saw her 
again.

January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
17
 
A: No, no.  
Q: Did she ever have t he opportunity to write in a letter what had happened to her? 

Did you ever find out details about her story, her life? 

A: Well, she didn™t  talk much about her conc Œ life in concentration camp, but she 

said it was tough, and Œ and of course, then she was working in a bank, as a clerk, 
because being the daughter of an officer, this new ga Œ new Œ new so- called Polish 
government , did Œ didn™t look at those people Œ 

Q: Very favorably. 

A: Very favorably, right. 

Q: Which concentration camp was she in?  

A: I Œ I really don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 
A: No. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: There™s a bunch of letters of hers, ma ybe in one of them I could find out, but I 

just Œ 
aft
er she died, I didn™t want to read t hose letters. 
Q: That™s understandable. What year did she die? 

A: Fifty-two or ™53, something like that. 

Q: So, she was a young woman. 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
18
 
A: She was 38 when she died. 
Q: Very young woman, yeah. 

A: As a matter of fact, her friend send us t o 
England
 t o get penicilli n, and we sent 

something, but it was t oo late. 

Q: Oh. And your uncle, you sa y he was also in a concentrat ion camp? 
A: Yes, then he came back to 
Poland
, br Œ as a matter of fact, she was buried at 
Pouwonski
(ph). 
Q: Your sister? 

A: Yeah. And I™m sure that right now it™s probably cost 10,000 dollars, the plot over 

there. But I™m sure during that Œ i n 50s it was still Œ so he buried her t here, so Œ 

Q: Your uncle took care of that? 

A: Yeah. And he wrote me couple ti mes, and t hen asked me, why don™t you come 
back? And I wrote hi m back, I said, listen, I don™t want t o come back to a country 
which killed my father. And so then I got the reply, he sai d, those lett ers with 

English stamps do me l ot of harm. So our correspondence stopped at that. 
Q: Oh dear, oh dear. Were you able to find out  more about what his li fe had been 

under German occupation? 

A: No, not really. 

Q: And so you wouldn™t know what concentrat ion camp he was in. 

 
Interview with Eugene Chmielowski  
 
January 31, 2015 
 
 
 
19
 
A: No, I wouldn™t know. But at Œ the letters did sa y that the y were in a Œ in a cattle 
car, something like that, like we to 
Siberia
. And someti mes the y were standing i n 
the water up to their ankles, and stuff like that. So there were some horror stories 

about his l ife.  

Q: And it™s also Œ I mean, that is a tragedy, but it is also a tragedy that you could 
never meet and talk about these things. That you Œ that Œ that you were so separated, 
and you couldn™t correspond. 

A: Well, of course, back in 50 s Œ  ™53, li ke any young man, is not interested in those 

things. I mean, I was al ways patriot, stuff like that, but you know, young people, 

they have different Œ for example, even here in Œ I jo-joined the Siberi an society 

about 25 years ago. Before that it was pla yi ng cards; bridge, poker, st uff like that, so 

Œ 
Q: You were enjoyi ng your life. 
A: Yes, I don™t have any complaints, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. Oka y. 

A: I™m retired for 20 years now, and you know, I™m doing 
okay,and m y daughters 

are doing okay. My grandkids are doing okay, so Œ

immediate family, your mother, your father, yourself, pre-war
 Pol and

retiredfrom the mili tary, sothat youhad b
oth a maid, and other household help, and 

he had an orderly. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Oka y. Can you describe your home to me, i n

A: Well, we never owned the house. We always Œ  
Q: You had your own house?

Q: Rented, oka y. 

A: Yes. And, as I ment ioned, wi Œ for exampl e, when m y father was arrested, he was 

in prison i n 
Kovel Œ 

Q: Let™s not talk about the war yet. 
A: Yeah, okay. 
Q: I want t o just talk about what life was li ke beforehand. 

A: Oh, peachy, peachy. 

Q: Peachy.
 
A: Yes. As I said, we used to take walk in the park every Sunday. We used to go to 

the cemetery, visit t his aunt Œ 
m y

some 
Œ m y father had the military doctor, so Œ 
but y
ou know those military 
doctors, the y didn™t thi nk much of them. So he used to go to pri vate doctor, even

Q: Were you studyi ng any of these languages as a little boy? 

A: Well, I Œ I Œ when I went to Œ t o high school, I took English, because at that time

were in 
India
. And some people here, the y come and the y spend here 40 years, and 
the y don™t even learn English. 
Q: And she learned it t here? 

A: She had a rough time with it, I™m sure 
[indecipherabl e]

easygoing, but 
di- didn™t have much confidence  
Q: In himself? 

A: Œ even t hough Œ  even though he had, you know, good education, and so on. But 

he wasn™t pushy, let™s put it this way. And he Œ like in any Œ in any area, you have to 
be pushy, to really succeed.  

Q: And did you sense t hat from how you knew hi m, that he was more reserved Œ 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Œ he was more Œ okay.  

A: Yes.

Q: Did he treat you, for whatever wounds you Œ 
A: No, the Œ 

Q: No. 

A: It wasn™t big wound, just a scrat ch. 

Q: Just a scratch. Were your parents very religious, or not so much? 

A: Not so much. The y Œ th-the y believe in God, but my mother very seldom used to 

go to church, and Œ and m y father, right before the war, I t hink, he went to Œ to 
confession, and so on. And of course m y mother was running the orphanage, and she 
was running the home for the old people.

Q: And also an old people™s home. 

A: Yes. Of course, non-profit. 

Q: Mm-hm. But was it like a full time job?  

A: For her it was. And as a matter of fact, the president of the Œ of the 
Kovel
, she 
was involved there as well, but later the y found that she took some money, so there 
was a trial be-behind the closed door.  

Q: Really? 

A: In those da ys when somebody got the big position, the y used to get every break 

possible. Yeah, so Œ and the Œ on the other hand, m y mot her used to take some st uff 

from home, and take it to the orphanage and my father sa ys, well, what are you

Bol sheviks
, how bad they were, and so

Germany

England

course, m y father thought that after 20 years, the 
Bolsheviks
 became more human. 

As it turned out, t he y weren™t. 

Q: Yeah. So the y Œ 
beca 
Œ did the y talk about 
Bolsheviks

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did Œ did Œ did he have some sort of inside information, or was thi s something

the Œ in 
K ovel
 heard this, how Œ how were people behaving? How were the y 
reacting to t his news? 
A: Well, I t hink they took it in stride. For example, we Œ we lived Œ we lived close to 

downtown, and on one occasion we went to the Œ where there was a arm y 

headquarters, and the y have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch, 

with m y father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all  of a sudden the planes 

came over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh, 

those are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes. 
Q: Did the y really? 
A: The y di d. And as he said the y are Polish, they started shooting. So we went Œ run 

away from the buil ding, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there. 

So that was like probabl y t hird and fourth of September.  

Q: Amazing that they were so close you coul d see the faces.

with those aircraft guns, so then the y were flying very high. Evidently the y had 

some 
space on the ground. 

Q: So those first few weeks, your Œ was that as close as you got to someone from the 

German mil itary 
Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ was t his person in the plane? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Or did you see soldi ers on the ground? 

A: Not German, Russians. 

Q: Oka y. But before we come to t he Russians, those first weeks before the y Œ they 

arrive, what were peopl e doing? What was happening in 
Kovel
?  
A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because the y 

made the hospital with those schools. So Œ and I was going to go to the fourth grade, 

but never happened. And Œ 

Q: By the way, were there Jewish people in 
K ovel
? 

A: Quite a few, yeah. 

Q: And what professions did they usually have, or jobs, or trades? 

A: Running busi nesses, running businesses, what else?

she was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they Œ they were Œ 

Q: Supporting it. 

A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and Œ and I was 
talking wit h his son. Hi s son was six, seven years older, and I was tell ing hi m that 
we going to beat Germans, and thi s guy says, no wa y, the y™re too strong. Of course, 

he was 15, or something. 

Q: So, two military experts having a conversation. 

A: Exactly, yes. 

Q: So, people still cont inued going to work, even though there was no school. What 

was the talk that was going on? 
A: Well, real ly, we didn™t interact with Œ with the outside world, you know, we just 
Œ m y mother, father, and m yself, except 
forthattripthat we made to that military 

mess over t here. 
Cassi no
(ph), you could call it 
cassino
(ph), really. So, I never 

finished that lunch. 

Q: No, I guess not. So you stayed at home.

arrive at some point? 

A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at  that ti me 

everybody was
 expecting the day going t o Œ t o gas, but never happened. So we Œ we 

Œ we received the masks, those hi gh Œ hi gh tech masks that Œ because the old ones, 
you could choke in them. The new ones, t he y were really comfortabl e, but we never 
use them. And later we cut them t o pieces because the y didn™t want Russians to take 

them over. 

Q: Oka y. So how do things progress throughout September? What  happens? 

A: Well, September 17
th

Poland

were marching, this sol dier Œ I was outside Œ came by me. Says, can you g

on the 18
th
 of September.

away, if you™re going to give us some information about lot of people in this town. 

And of course m y mot her turned them down, for two reasons. She was really 
patriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn™t pick up it.

Russia
, a letter, 
in 1940, in December. She sa ys t hat she Œ she Œ she passed the parcel to Œ 
to m y 
father, and at that time, he wasn™t t here. So evi dently those Œ those pri son officials

A: Well, as I said i n Œ I, from the very begi nni ng Œ for example, after m y father was 

arrested, I used to go with this girl, you know, go play. And I didn™t think much of 
it. I mean, I was sorry they arrested him. I didn™t think, you know, he™d be killed, but 
Œ 
butall my life 
I have everything t ook in stride, because I figured well, it™s not 
going to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things 

worse. So, I was on the train, doing nothi ng, li ke most of the people. The y were 

singing, and so on.  

Q: Was it that you were trying to keep yoursel f from being sad? 

A: Oh, as I said, you know, usually I Œ I take things in stride. It™s Œ 
I lost m yfather

stories, and then there™s what really happens, you know? 

A: You know, I hate to sa y, but we had all  this stuff that we took Œ took from 

Poland
, because somet imes you couldn™t buy anyt hing with mone y, was all with

A: Yeah, most of the ti me. I think I was very hungry ma ybe two da ys out of those 
two years. But what I explained that my mother did so, so good, you know, over the 

Œ her lifetime, so maybe somebody was watching over us. 

Q: You never know, you never know. Then tel l me, what was the hardest part of 

being there?  
A: Hardest part of being there – was pretty boring. Boredom. 
Q: Was there a school? 
A: Yeah, there was a school, but my mot her di dn™t want t o send me to Russian 

school. She was afraid they may convert me, which would never happen. So she told 

them that I don™t have shoes, and the board of education sa ys the y don™t have in t he 

budget money f Œ to buy stuff for the shoes. So I wasn™t going to school, which was 

a big mistake, because I could learn s-somethi ng. Th-Th Œ they had a good level 
mat h in Russian school s, and of course I learned Russians at home, because lot of 
those Russians officers came to 
Poland
 after 
Bolshevik
 
revolution. Asa matter of 
fact, we lived block and a half for

m y parents speak Russian, so they were talking in Russian all the ti me. 
And you 
know, eight year ol d, nine year old kid, picks i t up like that. So m y parents 
realized 

that I understood everything, so if they wanted to sa y something that I don™t Œ 

wouldn™t understand, they switched to German, because Russian I understood 

everything. Even now I understand everything in Russian, m y Œ i-if I took a brush-

up course, probably that would came back to me, the Russian language. 

Q: So, did you have to work as well, or were you to Œ
