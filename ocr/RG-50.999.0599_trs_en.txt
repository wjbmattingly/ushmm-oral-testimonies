Jacqueline justhad surgery on herfoot but you wouldn't know it by the wa
y 
she bounded up the stairs. 
 

3 
 
 
T hank youfor joining us. You have so muchto share with us and we just have one 
hour to try to do asm uch as we can.W e'll start right awa y.
 
 
Let's begin today with you telling us what you canabout yourf am ily in your own e
a r l y 
years bef orethe anschluss, knowing at that tim e you were very young. You don't have 
personal memories ofm ostof that but telluswhat you have learned and what you know about 

thatperiod, about your fam ily.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
A ll I  kn o w is  
that when I was 3 years old and there was the 
anschluss, m y parents got scaredand we leftParis and we went to a little town that I really 

don't know, and then we went back toParis. Ireally don't have any m em ories of  that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell us about 
your parents'nationalities because that's had som e signif icance.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
My m other was born in Hamburg, Germ any, so she was a 
Germ an Jew and m yfather was a Dutchand born
 
--
 
f or centuries thef am ily Mendels was from  
a little town in thenortheast of  Holland. And in the cem etery there are m any tombs of Mendels 

fam ily. And when m yfatherm arriedm y m other or when m y motherm arriedm y father, she 

becam e Dutchby m arriage.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How large was your extended fam ily?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, m y mother was an only child. She had cousins who later on 
we can talk about that if  we have tim e, were on the Kindertransport,were able to goto 

England.So shehadfour cousins. But otherwise she was an only child. Her parents
 
--
 
h e r 
f
ather died.
 
 
By the way, m y nam eJacqueline is becausem y grandfather was called Jacob and m y 
parents were so hoping f or a boy.T hey hada girl, m y big sister. So I was going to bethe 

French equivalentof  Jacob, it was going to be 
J
ack.And here I come out a girl, so Jacqueline 

af ter m y grandfather.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I hadn't he
a
rd  tha tb efo re . Ok.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
My f am ily on my f ather
 
--
 
s o rry
 
--
 
on my f ather's side was quite 
extended.T hey were all m urdered,everybody.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Everyb ody in the extended fam ily. You hadm entioned to me thatduring that 
period yourf ather'sbusiness was notdoingwell. Can you say a little bit about that? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, France had adepression just like America. My f ather was a 
businessm an, im porting, exporting specialty foods.
 
 
If I can go aheadof m yself, after the Germ anconveyed Paris and there were all kinds 
of  laws against the Jews, he was not allowed to keep hisbusiness. He had to give it awa y to 

his associate whof ortunately was a goodm an.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And Ihope we'll talk a little bitabout thata littlebit later, absolutely.
 
 
As you mentioned, after the anschluss, your parents left Parisf or a little while and 
returned.T ell us what you can about thatperiodfor t
he
 
f am ily and whathappened with you 
and yourfam ily during the period right bef oreGerm any invaded Poland and war began, 

September
 
1939, so between the anschlussandthe beginning of the war.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
I was too young.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To
o young.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W hen the Germans invaded, I was 4 years old. So all I know is 
thatI was terribly af raid of the Germ ans.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yo
u had mentioned, and you I think wrote about it inyour book, that when they 
f l ed
,  
they took you
 
Fontainbleau,I think.W astherea reasonfor going there, to your 
knowledge? Have you been able to learn that?
 

4 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Probably therewas a second time that we lef t. It was before the 
Germ ans invaded Luxem bourg, Belgium, Hollandand France. So there was a period thatwas 
ver y diff icultand we went probably around Fontainbleau.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Don't know the details.
 
 
In March1939, your parentshad you and Manuela declared Frenchcitizens. T ell us 
wh y that was signif icant.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
T hat's abig story.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yeah.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W e were born in Paris
 o
f Dutch parents. My f ather went to the 
City Hall to have us declared French, which was helped. But after Petain and Hitler signed the 

cease, 
anybody likemy sister andm e who had been in a way, naturalized French, according 
to the laws and according to a law of 1927 we lost it.So we were foreign Jews. W e lost our 

French citizenshipand we became Dutch Jews, which were thef irst tobedeported
,  w
ere not 
French anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But atthatpoint in 1939, yourparents wantedtom ake sure that you 
were 
off icially and inevery wa y considered French citizens.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah, but it didn't last. And I know later on when we crossed the 
demarcation line, thatm y f athertook that piece of paper
 
--
 
which I have on the wall, and I can 
see it wasf olded inf our. Andm yf ather was hoping that the two daughters, my sister andm e, 

would be declared French and wouldn't be deported.
 
>> B
ill Benson:
 
You also shared with m e that in the year that the war began butbefore it 
began in Septem ber
 
1939, your fam ily were able to takea coupleof trips. Ithinkthey went to 
see your mother'sf am ily in Ham burg as well as took atrip to Holland durin
g that prewar 

period.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
T hat was in 1937. I have photos of that. But I don't rememberit.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Af ter war brokeout, your fam ily lef t Parisf or a second time but returned after a 
short period.In thefollowing spring, of
 
course, in May of 1940, is whenGermany attacked 
Belgium  and Hollandand then, of course, they in vaded France in June of 1940. W hen they 

invaded France, yourfam ily f led Parisfor a third tim ebut you, again, returned to Paris.Tell us 

wh y you think your parents several tim es leftParis but only returned to Paris. And in this 

particular case when they returned, now theGerm ans were there.W hat motivatedthem to 

return to Paris?W hatwas lif e likef orthem  whenthey cam ebackafter that third time? 
 
>> J a c q
ueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell,  
the third tim e was the big time. It was the exodus. My f ather 
got a little carf rom his off ice where he was still in charge. I rem em ber I had m y dollandm y 

sister had herdoll. And we traveled until I guess there was nom oregasoline in the car.W e 

stopped in a little town. My f ather knockedat the door and said could we spendthe night and 

actually we spent three weeks there. 
 
 
T hey were wonderf ul people.W e weref our girls. I have aphotoof  them . I was the 
youngest of  thefour.W espent time.They gave us a room and their dining room.T hey were 

absolutely
 
--
 
and they never accepted any money. Andf inally when France was occupied, my 
father said, well, I have to earn a living and we went back toParis.
 
A lot of the Jews never 
we
nt back to Paris at that tim ebecause theGerm ans were all over in the northern partof  
France.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Butf oryour f ather it was that's where m y business is. Becausehis business 
was there.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Righ t .
 

5 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In  th
eexodus, as you ref erred to it, there was really hundredsof  thousands if  
notm illions of Parisians fleeing.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
People cam eall the way f rom Belgium because Belgium  was 
occupied 
--
 
and people were walking. One of the survivors, Albert, that you know, told me how 
they didn'thave the use of a caror truck or van andthey were walki ng. 
His
 
m other was shot 
anddied right there while they were walkin g. W e were very luck y. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I hopewe get a chance to talk about that, too,
 
a  lit t le b it  la t e r.
 
 
At one point your parents, Ithink, considered trying to leave f ora Dutch colony but 
they didn't do that.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwas behind that?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, apparently m y f ather thought that Curacao, which was a 
Dutch colony, would take in 
J ews
. And the queenof  Holland,QueenW ilhelm ina, atthat time, 
had said that she wasgoing to helppeoplethat were in distress, Dutch people in the distress.
 
 
Actual
ly, I dida lot of  research onthat and it's nottrue, she was not. But som ething I 
justf ound now, by somebody whose f am ily survi ved in Shanghai, that there was a Chinese 

m an, a wonderf ulm an, that was m akingf akevisas f or people to go to Curacao. 
 
 
So  e
verything I'm  telling you is such a long story.
 
M y grandmother in Hamburg was 
t r yi n g
 
--
 
was thinking of  going east to Shangh
a i .  If  t
here had been Am ericafor her, she would 
have done thatand she would have ended up maybe in Curacaobut, of course, allof  
that 

never happened. It's astory.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yo u  and
 
--
 
even though you were so young, youandyour sister do have som e 
m em ories of  the German attack on Paris.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usa little bit about that.
 
>> J a c qu
eline Mendels Birn:
 
All I know is that I was so afraid of theGerm ans.T here were 
Germ ans upstairsf rom us.W e lived onf irstf loor
,  
French, which is second f loor America. They 
were upstairs taking over. They took over fam ily
 
--
 
a Jewish f am ily that hades
caped. So we 
had Germans upstairs f rom  us. 
 

 
My
 
m other was doingan errand
 
--
 
Jews were  only allowed to go shopping between 
5:00
 
and 7:00
 
p.m .and m y mother said don't open thedoor.And there was a ringing of the 
bell. And there'sm e, little curious
 
--
 
I'
m  s t ill c urio u s  t o da y
 
--
 
opened the door.And then I see 
boots. I was little.T hey were boots.And they were the Germ ans. And I don't know whether 

they were the ones that lived thereor whether they were f riends, I have no idea, but they 

closed thedoor. And at that tim e we were not wearing our Jewish star yet.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That hadn't happened.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W hich wasf ortunate.When I toldm y m other, when she came 
back, I was severely p unished, of course.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You returned to P
aris and then you continued living i n Paris until the summer 
of  1942 when your parents arrangedfor thefour of  you
 
to leave Paris for Vichy or "f
r ee "  
France.T ellus about the events that led up to your parents' decision that it was time to leave 

P a ri s  fo
r good or at least at that time andhow you found yourself ,af ter that decision, in this 
vil lage of LeGot.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
T hat's a very, very long story. M y parents'f riends where we lived, 
which was near the zoo
 
--
 
and I loved the zoo but we were notallowed to go to the zoo 
anym ore. I loved the monkeys.
 

6 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That was partof the restrictions. Jews were not
 
--
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W e were not allowed anything.W e were notallowed to gotothe 
lib ra
ry, not allowed to take booksout. My f ather lost hisbusiness. My sister was learning to 
swim . She was not allowed to go tothe swim m ing pool. Everything was f orbiddenf or the Jews. 
W e were not allowed to go to the little parks.It was forbidden
 
--
 
how does it go? It was 
forbiddenfor blacks, f or darks, andfor Jews
,  
in that order.W e were learning to ride our bikes 
and we were notallowed to go to that littlepark.
 
 
But, yeah,m y parents' f riends said you can't stay in Paris. It was toodangerous.T hey 
we
re arresting peoplestarting in 1940, 1941.T hey said you have toleave andmyf ather, 
through the Dutch club where he was am ember,f ound two, what he hoped, were reliable 

passeurs, which m eans sm ugglers, andf orafee
 
--
 
and I don't know where he got the
 
m on ey 
because he didn'thave a job anym ore
 
--
 
offered to get usually to the dem arcation line.
 
 
In them eantim e, in July
 
16 and 17, 1942, was that inf am ous [Speaking Non
-
E n glis h  
Language], what's it called? I'm m issing thatword. Anywa y when they rounded up [Speaking 

No n
-
English Language], where they roundedup 13,000 Jews, m ostly f rom anarea in Paris 
where there was a higher concentration.W edidn't live in a Jewish neighborhood.There were 

Jews, of  course, but not ahigh percentage.
 
 
W hat I should say, also, is thatm y father wanted toobey the law. And when it was 
declared that the Jews had to registerat theCity Hall, he said, well, we'll do what they wa nt 

andthey will lea ve us alone.W ell,f at chance. So we were registered.
 
 
T here were some good policem en. Becausethat was the French police that rounded 
up the Jews. T hey wer e supposed to roundup 27,000 Jews in Paris. Butf ortunately, and 

thanks to some good police, people were tolddon't sleep in your apartment tonight because 

they are com ing to round you up the next m orning at 5:00
 
a.m . So people changed or m oved 
to som e nice Catholic neighbors. 
 

 
France is a Catholic country, as you know, I'm sure. So that's why 13,000 Jews 
instead of 27,000. Butthere were 4,000 children living in terrible conditio
n s. 
There is a 
docum entary that wasm ade, the roundup about that story. 
 

 
Some people m anaged to escape. 
They wer e rounded 
up in buses. Som e people 
threw them selves outof  the window and died becausethey knew som ething horrible was 

happening. And there we
 
were, they forgot to ring our bell thatday. T hey f orgotto ring ourbell. 
T hey rang our bellone week af ter we escaped. So that was the
 
--
 
the roundup was 16,17th of 
J u ly
 
1942 which was very late in the war. T he Germans were all over.
 
 
You hearm e use theword Germ an. Form ethe word Nazi didn't exist. It was 
[Speaking Non
-
English Language]. In Frenchit's like that. And I heard it way af ter the war.
 
 
So anyway, those wonderfulfriends ofm y parents,they com eand spend the last night 
with us. T hem an of
 
the house
 
--
 
they lived near the Metro. T hey said it would be very easy f or 
you tomorrow m orning to catch thef irst Metro. Jews were allowed at6:00
 
a .m . in the  la sttrain  
of  the Metro. So we we nt. Maurice was his nam e,f ound Jewish stars and burned them .
 
B u t  m y 
parents had their I.D. cards and it said Juif s.So if  thepolice came and askedfor [Speaking 

No n
-
English Language], your papers, that would have been it.But like many, many, m any 
m iracle like I talk about and wrote about,thatm orning when we left there was nopoliceasking 

for [Speaking Non
-
English Language].
 
 
And I'm  wearing something that madam  gavem e. I took itthism orning. If  anybody's 
Catholic here, you will know Notre Dame de Lourdes, in theSouth of France.
 
 
Anybody Catholic here? No? Yes? You're Catholic. So you know aboutLourdes. 
 

7 
 
 
And there was a wom an, Iforget hernam e, but in the19th Century who had been 
saved. Somadam  gave a m edal tom y sis
te r
 
andm y m otherand tom e. Mine is quiteold
. I
t 
says Notre Dam e de Lourdes. She say that will help you. And I have it to this day.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And your sister has hers.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes. Yeah. Buthers is not asprecious as m inebecause it doesn't 
say Notre Dam e de Lourdes.Butthis is
 
--
 
as I said, it will save you.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:
 
I'm glad you were able to share that with us. I know there's so much to tell and 
we're going to not have timef oreverything. Let's go back a little bitandbrief ly tell us about the 
letter that your m other got f rom  her m other.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah. My grandm other in Hamburg, my f ather had tried to get her 
outbut shealready walked with pain.And she said" Nothing wil l happen to me." And in1941, 

Novem ber
 
1941, well, in the summ er of 1941her apartment was taken over. She was put i
n 
what's called a Jew house, if  you want. It was am iserable little place. She got a letter saying 

that shehad to report the next m orning.Shealready knew that wasgo east to Auschwitz o r 

oneof  the camps.All herfriends were disappearing one by one. She knew it was the end.So 

she tookanoverdoseof  sleeping pill and com m itted suicide.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And she wrote this to your m other.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes. She wrotea letter. She didn'tusethe word
 
--
 
I have a copy 
of  the letter inm y book. And she said farewell. I can extrapolate a little bit about that, I think. 

I'm  pretty sure that this is when m y m other got cyanidefor us because m y mother toldus,m y 

sister and me," Don't worry. If  the Germ ans com eto getus, I'll give you a little pil
l.  Yo u  will d ie  
right awa y and you will never suff er."  
 
 
No w
,  
I know if  there are som e young parentshere, they think it's im possible to do that 
butm y sister and I, we took itf or granted sowe'll die and we won't suffer.And that was the 

m o st im po rta nt th in g, no t to suffe r.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And through the duration of the war your m otherhad those.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes. Shehad those. And the whole vill age
 
--
 
later on you'll see 
where we were in hiding, the whole village, maybe the Mendelsf am il
y wi ll c o m m it  su ic id e .  
Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Through all of that youfoundyourself  getting to this little village in Le Got.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah. Notexactly r ight away. [Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Not right away. So tell us a little bit about actually getting there.Becausethat 
hadall kindsof  risks f or you. You're now in what's called theunoccupied zoneof  France.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
So
-
called unoccupied zone. Yeah. Sowe lef t that morning, after 
that wonderf ulfam ily had housed u
s tha t n ight. My little  f rie nd  
Ce c ilia ,
 
who justdied, I 
rem em ber sharing abed with her.And the two boys in thatfam ily, M ichel
,  1 5  ye
ars old, and 
hisf riend, Michel Deneaux
, to o k
 
--
 
m y parents puttheir lif e belongings in abackpack. Im agine. 
And they b
ou gh t the  ticke ts. 
 
 
Because Jews, of  course, were notallowed.You needed a visa. You needed an 
[Speaking Non
-
English Language] in Germ an, and Jews were not allowed any of  that. 
 
 
So they got all of  thatfor us.T hey m etus at the train station [Speaking 
Non
-
E n glis h  
Language], the station going south.And they gave us, m y parents, a backpack. My sister and I 

didn't have anything.
 
W egotonthe train, we had eachother.W egot on thetrain.And the train 
wouldn't leave. Andmy f ather
 
--
 
I remem ber that. Myf ather becam ef rantic. He wentto the 
head of that [Speaking Non
-
English Language] thatparticular train to see what was going on. 

8 
 
T here was a wom an who said they are rounding up Jews ontheother sides of the tracks.So 
you can imagine
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You'resitting thereon that train.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
About to leave.Andf inally, they had their quota of Jews that 
m orning,probably, and the train left, slowly, sl owl y.
 
 
T hen we had to change trains in [Speaking Non
-
English Language], another 
b ig c it y.  
And m y sister
 
--
 
to thisday m y sister said shefell. She didn't have aconcussion but she hurt 
her back. Andanotherm iracle because if  wehadto go to thehospital, they would have seen 

Juif s on m y parents' paper. That wouldhavebeen the end. But shesaid it's okand we got to 

them iddle of the train. W e were meeting supposedly those two
 
passeurs, those two 
s m u ggl e r s
, butthey cam eand said we can't take you.W hy? Idon'tknow.W ehad to check 
into a hotel, which we did.
 
 
T he next m orning
 
--
 
it
 
wa s h o t. It wa s the  31 st of
 
July. It canbe very hot in France.W e 
hadto walk 10
 
k ilom ete rs ,  s ix m ile s .  A nd f o r lit t le  le gs
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That'sa long way.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
I rem em ber resting undera tree, actually.W e were supposedto 
m
eet the sm ugglers. They showed up.T heywere not always honest but our smugglers we re 
ver y honest. At m idnight, in the cem etery behind the church, at m idnight.W e did. And they 

were there. And they cam e with two bicycles.
 
 
I wish I would be able to f ind out what happened to thosetwo young m en.T hey were 
ver y honest.I shoulddo some researchhereat them useum , actually. One was a son of a 

farm erand the other was a sonof  a baker.
 
 
W estarted walking. Yo u know, the Germ answere there and we wer e there. I 
rem em ber seeing the cigarette 
b
utts right there. And one of  them  said, go down on your knees
, 
w
hich we did. It was sum mer but it was wet in them iddle of the night. Andmy sister saidat 
thattim e " I have to go pee pee." It soundsf unny, but could have been tragic because if  they 

heardthat, that wouldhave been theend of us.
 
 
Andalso,m y parents carried a ring. My f ather was able to get som egold ring. In 
French
 
--
 
you have this in English, too,[Speaking Non
-
English Language]. It's yourm oney or 
your lif e or your goldor your life.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Money or your lif e.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
My parents were hoping that they would give their ring. I have 
that ring. I'm  not wearing it today. T hat we wouldhave our lif e.
 
 
W e managed to cross the dem arcat
io
n line.My sister and I were on one bicycle.T he 
other cyclist was ahead. He had a whistling signal with m y father saying e verything is clear. So 

we were able to cross the demarcation line
 i
n the so
-
called f ree zone.
 
 
T here was a contingent of soldiers acceptedby Vichy, by hitter andPetain. And they 
tookus through the barracks. But the next morning the commandant, or thehead, said we 

can't keep you. And they took usunder escort toa town where we were.W e checked into a 

hotel. My parents didn't know anybody.W e were very tired. A knockat the door,police.
 
M y 
parents were under arrest. 
 
 
T hey were interrogated. Ifound that all in the archives later on.T hey had to say that 
they were of the Jewish race,that they left Paris because it was too dangerous, that we are 

honest people, etc. 15 m inutesfor m yf ather and he said he had 4,000f rancsor som ething. 

And thenm y m other, 15 m inutes, the sam e thing. She said she had4,000f rancs with her and 

that she was
 
--
 
but som ething really interesting. She said she wasborn in Hamburg, Germ any. 

9 
 
And if the police
 
--
 
theFrench police hadbeen smart, they would have said, oh, Germ an Jew, 
andthey would, they could,they should have shipped her directly to a camp in the South of  
France where they putall German Jews and they didn't. They were not sm artenough, lucky f or 

us. She was naturalized Dutch by m arriage. 
 
 
So m y parents
 
--
 s
o then we were underescort tothe headquarters. And there we 
were under
 
--
 
m y parents were under arrestagain. For a whole month
 
they had to reportever y 
day.W e were in the little hotel.W e were eating
 i
n the soup kitchen. I rem em ber long table.But 
I don't rem em ber being hungry. But we hadfood, like homeless people here.
 
 
At the endof  them onth there was am an, the m an in charg
e of  that area, and som e 
otherareasthat had the right of  lif eor death.And that was oneof  the Petain laws. Sohe could 

putus ina cam p. AndFrance hada lot of  cam ps
, n
ot death cam psbut concentration camps
 o
r 
to [Indiscernible]. He was a goodm an. Ifound outhis name. He saidget lost in the country.
 
My parentsf ounda tiny, tiny vil lage called Le Got where there were30 houses.W ehadtwo 

room s upstairs
, n
o water, notoilet, no electricity, no nothing. My sister and I went to get water 
out of  the pu
m p.Oncea week we could wash in a tub
, o
ne after theother.That's where we 
spent 29 months.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I wantyou to tellus about that tim e but let's start with in August
 
1943 your 
m other gave birth to your brother Franklin.And that was, under the
 
circu m st an ce s,  clea rly a  
ver y diff icult tim e.T ell a little about hisbirth and what itm eantfor your parents andfor youin 

this little village of  LeGot.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah. My m other became pregnant.Actually two m onths af ter we 
arrived,
 
m ore or less,m y brother was born in August
 
1943.W e had arrived in October
 
1 942 .  
Andall of  France wasoccupied, by the way. Novem ber
 
11, the
 
--
 
Hitler decided because the 
Am ericans had invaded NorthAf rica, ok
,  
sowe are occupying all of France.So the 
G e rman s  
were all over.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
German soldiers were everywhere now.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
In our village, too, all over. I won'thave tim etotell but the 
Gestapo came, actually, to
 
--
 
because of theyoung m an downstairs had beendenounced.S
o 
they were
 
--
 
there wer ef ive Gestapo guards. They didn't goupstairs becausehe was good 
enough not to say don't kill m ebut goupstairs there'sa Jewishf am ily. He never
 
--
 
he was 
torturedf or three weeks. But he never saidanything.
 
 
Anyway, m y m other was pregnant.She wasver y sick. You know, we didn't have 
doctorsor anything. She spent nine months
 
--
 
I have little notes that were kept. I was telling m y 
m other Ihope you will feel better tom orrow. She hada terrible, terrible tim e. I rem ember once 

sh e  
did go to the nextvil lage where we were allowed to go. I was pushing, and my sister, we 
were pushing her up the hill. She was wearing a night gown. She didn't have pregnancy 

clothes, of  course. She was wearing a night gown.W e were pushing her. I don't k
n o w i f i t  wa s  
a doctor ordentist.
 
Anywa y, the time came when she was supposed to give birth and there 
was a wom an that was supposed to help with thebirth. [Speaking Non
-
English Language]. 
How do you say that?English?
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
Like a m idwif e? 
 
>> 
Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Am idwif e.T hebaby was in thebreech position andm y m other 
was bleeding. She had to be transported, whi ch was strictly f orbidden.The midwif e said there 

is a hospital but it's inanother department 
[Speaking 
Non English Language
]  w
here she was 
notallowed to go. It was them iddle of night. 
 

10
 
 
 
T hem an downstairs who workedf ortheGerm ans, took his car and tookm y mother, 
who was bleeding to death, and with m yf ather and they m ade it to thathospital which was  in 
the back of  a chate
auwhere there was daylight. On one side thedoctor that we saw 20 years 

ago, was treating Germ an soldiersbecausethey had som ething, too, andon theother side 

was a Jewish wom anwho was about to die.My m other hada rareblood type, which I have, 

to o , A
-
B plus. And tof ind blood
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In wartim e.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah.T hey didn't have blood banks in those days. You can 
im agine.
 
Butm y m other survi ved. My brother was born. Andm y parentsnam ed him Franklin. 
 
 
Does anybody know why
 
Franklin which in French is Franklin? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For Roosevelt?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Because the only hope of survi val f orm y parents was Roosevelt 
at that tim e.T hey didn't have news. T hey didn't have radio. But they had heard bef ore we f led
 

that Franklin Roosevelt m ight help.Actually, we know now
 
that 
Franklin Roosevelt didn't do 
m u ch
.  Bu
t if  thebaby had been a girl, they were going to call her Marianne because Marianne 
is the sym bol of  France. It was aboy so thiswas Franklin. T hey even 
ha d  h im  circum cised ,  

which was ver y dangerous because thatmeant a Jewish boy. 
 

 
My m other couldn'tbreast
-
f eed. I don't know. T here was nobody.T he m ilk didn't 
agree. He alm ost died.
 
I don't know if  you saw a photo. My brotherwas cr ying. T he nursesaid, 
O
h, what about baby?T he milk didn't agreewith him . I don't know if they knew aboutboiling 
m ilk or anything. Butback tothree weeks m y m other was ableto travel. I don't know under 

what circum stances. Cam e back.
 
 
In them eantim e,m y sister and I were taken care of by a Spanish refugeef rom  the 
Spanish CivilW ar. Many Spanish refugeeshadm oved to the South of  France. AndI 

rem em ber the boy there he learned
 
--
 
he taughtm e how to play marbles.T hat's what I 
rem em ber. [Laughter]T hat was a big deal.W e had
 
no toys.W ehad nothing. But he had 
m arbles. So he helped us to play m arbles.
 
 
Miracle of  m iracles, you know now f rom  whatI wrote, m y father discovered sweet 
concentratedm ilk, which still exists these days, the Nestle. Andm y m other was abletodilute 

t
hat. My sister and I had to go get water, of  course. And then when that tin was empty, I licked 
the bottom it tasted so good.W e didn't have m uch food.W e had chestnuts, that's what we 

survi ved on. So that little bit
 
--
 
I rem em ber tothis day how good it was. [Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You would rem ain in,as you m entionedearlier, in Le Gotf or29m onths, more 
than two years. Andduring that tim e you were notdenounced. How did your fam ily m anage to 

survi ve during that time and to not be denounced
 n
ow that
 
all of  France was occupied, Na
zi s,  
the Gestapoare everywhere?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
It was the law to denounce Jews, actually.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And there you are.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, they were wonderful people.T hey were ver y poor. The
y 
were f armers. My f ather was in hiding m ostof the tim e in an underground cellar or in the 

woods. 
 
 
And I have to say that the m ayor of Le Gotof  the village, I was able two years ago to
 
have him declared righteous am ong thenations because he savedour lives. Andthere was 

oneother Jewish fam ily that he kept. He wasaf arm er. Hehad atiny, tiny room . He helpedthe 

resistance, the underground people, as well. 
 

11
 
 
 
But whenever som ething was happening hetold usand we went into the woods, the 
whole fam ily. I remember we went into a chicken cooponce. But itm usthave been sum mer 
because I don't rem ember being cold. Buthewarned us every tim e.
 
 
One tim ethe situation was so desperate, m y parents wantedtoputm y sister and me 
in a convent. I don't think
 
--
 m
aybe it was before m y brother. I don'tknow if  it was beforeor 
af ter.It was in atown notfar away. And there was a convent.
 
My si ster and I were actually 
happy.W eprepared alittle bag with things. And then the mayor came and said you can't do 

that bec
ause the Germans are traveling through that road. And we never went. It'sa good 
thing we didn't go because then that conventwas raided and they wouldhave f oundtwo 

Jewish gi rls. And thatwould have been theend of us.
 
Sothere were som any m iracles like
 
tha t 
it's unbelievable. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the mayor, I think he provided you, thef am ily, with f alsepapers.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes. Except
 
--
 
once a week we wouldgo
 
--
 
on Saturday, only, by 
footor by bicycle, to getf oodor to get som ething, or go to goto the doctor.
 
T he whole time we 
were not sick. It'sanother m iracle.W e never neededa dentist or a doctor like children need 

usually, except m y mother's pregnancy.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:
 
That is amazing. You're young children. No sickness or anything.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah. But them ayor was absolutely wonderful. He gotthose 
papersf or us. But it said Juif s.And I rem em ber asking the archivist 20 years ago andhe 
said, 

well, you know, you we re declared [Speaking Non
-
English Language], a town, knew the 
Mendelsfam ily was there and they were a Jewish f am ily. They could comeany day to getus. 
 
 
So inorder to get tickets for buying f lour or
 
--
 
I don't think there was
 
o il
 
--
 
a f ew things, 
we needed those cards. But it said les Juif s.T hem ayor gotf alsepapers f or my parents which I 

think they never used. I remember seeing a drawer with those papers with f alse nam es. 
 
 
Also, there was a tablet of chocolatethat m ym oth
e r kep t.I rem em be r. I th in k I wro te it 
in m y book.W henm y m other f inally opened it, it was full of  worm s.Shehad to throw it away. 

[Laughter] Sof or the chocolate, we were looking f orward tohaving. W ehardly hadanyf ood. 

W e had chestnuts and walnuts.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that's what you lived onm ostly.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah.W ell, there was a baker and with our ticket we could get 
breadonce ina while. I remember when we were on our way to hiding in the forest, we stayed 

with that wonderf ul
 
fam ily. She did som ething thatm y sister forgotbut I remember.She did the 
cross, the Catholic cross. And then turned the bread over and thensliced it. I guess that was a 

custom .T here are many custom s in thatpart of  theSouth of France that som e people know. 

My French f riends probably know about that. Andthen we went into the woods.T heyf ound an 

ancient baby carriage for m y brother. All of us were there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Incredibly, you can't possibly do justice to describing it, but to think that you
 
are 
living openly but with hidden identities ina little village where it's thelaw to denounce Jews, the 

Villagers had to know you were Jewish.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
No .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You don't think they knew?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
I don't
 
think they knew what a Jew wa s. They knew we were 
refugeesf rom Paris. In Paris, m y sister andIwere well educated little girls and we did 

[Speaking Non
-
English Language].W hen we said hello toaf riendof m y parents, we bent 
down. And m y mother said
 
do n
'tdo that in this country. [Laughter] So we didn'tdo [Speaking 
No n
-
English Language]. Can you say that inEnglish?
 

12
 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I don't know. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, anyway. W hat I want to say is that thosef arm ers, they were 
a l l  f a rmers ,  t
hey struggled.T hey were what we call in French [Speaking Non
-
E n glis h  
Language].T hey were for the republic. And so many had lost somebody in the FirstW orld 
W ar.T hey hated the Germ ans. And there were som eprisonersof  war. I rem ember m y little 

f riend [Speaking Non
-
English Language], Itold him aboutthe poison and that we would die. 
His f ather was aprisoner of  war.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of  the Germ ans.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes. It was [Speaking Non
-
English Language]. Of coursef orthe 
Jews, once they said all m enhave to report andm y f ather, instead,would have been shipped 

to the gas chambers.He didn't go that night. He thanked his luckystar that he didn't. He 

disobeyed, actually.
 
 
But,no, the mayor was  m arvelous.And thef arm ers were strugglin g them selves. The 
underground people cam e to the village andraided some eggs or things because they needed 

to bef ed, too. And then the Germ ans cam eand they tookeverything. T hey took all the 

animals.T hey took everything. So it was tough for them . It was very tough. I think once in a 

while they ga ve us eggs, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
S o af ter  a l l  of  t hat  tim e,  i n  Au gu s t
 
1944, soon after the Normandy invasion, 
Paris was liberatedby theallies in August of1944.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Not right away. T he Germ ans were there in the south. And the 
Brem er company, whatever it's called, went up. And it was sodangerous. T hey went through 

all theVillages. I rem em ber. They were crossing our little street. I was curious
, a s  I 
always  am. 
Andm y m other said, Down! Because they could have shotm e right thereand then.They went 

to a village, [Speaking Non

--
 
they putall the menagainst 
the 
wa l l
. They shotthem  all. They putall thewom en and children in the church and they 
burned the church.And tothis day [Speaking Non

never been rebuilt.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
It's still th e
 
ruins that were lef t.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
E xa c t l y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soonce Paris was liberated in Augustof 1944, your father pretty quickl y m ade 
his way back to Paris and then cam eback toget thefam ily later.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
In Novem ber
 
1944.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
First, tell us about yourfather hearing about the Norm andy invasion.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
M y f a t h
er was out of his hiding place, the underground ina 
dilapidatedoldhouse from  oneof  the wonderfulf arm ers. He was out because it was June. 

Most people know June
 
1944 was the [Speaking Non

-
D a y.  
Andhe was picking cherries. That wasf ood,you know, for us.W hen he heard thenews, he 

fellf rom the tree. [Laughter] But he didn't get hurt. He cam ehom e.
 
But that was not,of  course, 
theend of the war but it was the beginning of a little bit of  joy.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat  pr o m p
tedhim at that mom ent then to headfor Paris? 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Hefelt thathewanted to know what happened to his business. 
He wanted to know what happened to our apartm ent, which hadbeen
 
--
 
he didn't know that but 
our apartment was occupied
 
by Germ an soldier or
 
--
 
the whole war.Furniture, everything h ad 
disappeared.W hen he got to Paris, the concierge told him  go to theCity Hall and see.Andm y 

fatherf oundthe bed here, athing there,andenvironm ents able to barely furnishour 

13
 
 
apartm ent.
 
My parents' bed was there.It was slit open. And they wer e looking.T hey thought 
m y parents had hidden m oney butthere was nothing except a slitmattress.
 
 
Som y f ather claim ed the apartm ent, which was very wise because the refugees that 
were com ing back,
 
f irst come,f irst serve, they would have taken ourapartm ent. I know of  
people who cam eback and their apartm enthad been takenby other ref ugees.But our 
apartm ent was there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather, by getting there so quickly, was able to reclaim  t
hat.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sohecam e back and gout and thefam ily in November. And you returned to 
Paris. Sothat's November
 
1944. You're backin Paris. You're trying to resum e lif e asbest you 
can. But, of  course, the war is still going on. Do you think your parents were worried the 

Germ ansm ight com eback, that victories m ight be reversed and that there was still threats 

because of the war wa s underway?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
You know, I can't answer that question. I don
't think you asked 
m ethat question. My parents were mostly concerned
 
--
 
m y m otherknew her m otherhad 
comm itted suicide but my f ather said we survi ved so surely m y m other
 
--
 
m y brother, m y 
sist e r 
--
 
m y f atherhada largef am ily, that they were in hiding and survi ved, too. And little by 
little, m yf ather went to the Red Crossandf oundout, actually, his mother was murdered in 

March 1943. My father had written he was sohoping to introduce his son to his m otherbutshe 

was long gone. And my father's brother, sister, cousins,everybody.
 
 
W ell, later on we found out. My niece dida lot of  research,that 200m embers of our 
extendedf am ily were m urdered,everybody was m urdered exceptm y two cousins that were in 

hiding in Holland.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Except for the two cousins.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ehave tim e to turn to our audiencef orafew questions. Bef ore we do,I want 
to ask youone more, Jacqueline. You lef t France 1957 to com e to the United Statesand marry 

Richard.W as it hard f
or your f am ily af ter all you hadbeen through?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Very hard. Very hard.W e were thef ive of us, with m y brother. 
W e we r e s o  t i gh t
-
knit.W ehad nof am ily. M y l ittlef riends went on Sunday to their grandm other, 
went on vacation.W eh
ad no one.We had us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
No aunts, no uncles, no grandparents.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
No. Nobody. My parents wanted to keep us tight, together.So 
when If ell in love with Richard and he askedm etom arry him , it was ver y hard. It was an 

ordeal for them.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And your sister alsoeventually cam e to the United States. Did your parents 
com e here?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yes.T hey came toSan Francisco.T hey spent10 years there, I 
think. Andthen they went back to France.
 
>> B
ill Benson:
 
I know there's so much m ore for us to talkaboutbut let's turn toour audience.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Let m e tell you one thing.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Absolutely.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Since allm y f am ily died, there is something called 
[Speaking

--
 
a Germ an man, very nice m an, to put

Idon't know if  
it's bronze or brick in f rontof  the last residence.T here is inT he Hague

--
 
I think we have timef or a couple of questions.W e 
have m icrophones ineach of the aisle.W e'regoing to ask that you wait until you have the 

m icrophone in your hand. Make your question, if  you can,as brief as you canand then I'l
l 
repeat it justtom ake sure that we hear it before Jacqueline responds.
 
 
I see we have one right over here.

Goodm orning. Asa tour guide,m y group was disappointed not to be able to go upstairs 
because we didn't have a reservation but I want to say to you we are so gratif ied to beable to 

com e in here,m y studentshere,and hear som eone relatetheirexperience that she had. I 

think your story, as you have related it tous,is sof ascinating. Eventhoughthey didn't go 

upstairs, they have afirsthand account of  what happened. I'm  conf ident it will stick with them  

for the restof  their lives. I
 
  
just want to thank you for being available. Idon't use the word enjoy anytim e I com e 
here. I ask them  what they learned what they are inspired by. So it will be never again.
 
 
T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Jacqueline, were you able tohear allof  that?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:

He's here with his group of students.T hey couldn'tget into thePermanent 
Exhibition today buthow wonderful it was to have theopportunity to hear yourf irsthand 

account andthat will h elp make sure thatthis never happens again.T hat's what his students 

wi ll take away with them .
 
 
T hank youfor that
. V e
ry kind rem arks. Thank you. 
 
 
T here we go. Right in the middle, I think.

He llo .  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He llo .
 
>>
 
I was wondering. Have you seena personalf riendof  yours captured and sent to the 
Holocaust? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question is if you saw som ebody personally taken away to go
 
--
 
during the 
Holocaust
. But I think this really gets to thef act that you hadnotonly so m anyf amily m embers 
that were deportedand were m urdered in death camps but also many, m any other neighbors, 

children,and many others that you lived with i n Paris,m any others lost their lives and were 

m urdered.I think that's probably what we're getting athere.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
Yeah. I don't understand. I saw
 
--
 
I we nt back to Parism any 
tim es.I saw those people thathousedus thelast night bef ore we escaped.
 
 
W hen I  ca m e  ba
ck toParis, I was 9 years old. So som eof  those people were still 
there,those neighbors. Som eof  them  were absolutely wonderf ul people.They suff ered 

because they didn't have food with the Germans occupationbut they didn't suffer like we did, 

of  c ou r s e .
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you. 
 
 
Letus go with onemore question
; t
hen it's time to close.

>>
 
You talked aboutmany different people who helped you survive this time
, p
eople who 
risked their lives to save your lives and thoseof  yourf am ily.W as there
 
a quality or 
characteristic that you felt thosepeopleall shared that wem ight learnf rom  their deeds? That 
was ver y heroic.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He's making thepoint that there were a num ber of people that youm entioned 
thathelped you,helped save you during thatwhole tim e, some risking their lives doing that. 

He's asking could yousee a characteristic orquality in them that maybe they had in common 

thatenabled them totake those risks and those goodactions. 
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:
 
It's d iff icu lt t
o answer your question.W hat I want to say is that I 
am a speakerhereat the Holocaustmuseum . I speak to a lot of people younger and older. 

Andm y f inal words are always tr y and do some good.W e see the planet thesedays,f ull of 

horrible events.And I tell people, you know, you can help a blind person cross the street. You 

don'thave to becomea doctor ora doctor without borders. Youhave young people that are 

going to choose a profession. 
 
 
T he principle thing is to try andm ake the planeta betterplace. I think it's very diff icult 
these days. Ourplanet, Im ust say, when I read thepapers som etimes, every day, actually, our 

planet is becom ing rotten. So we are going to have toeither im prove it or chooseanother 

planet. 
 
 
T hat's what I say to young pe
ople. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou for thatf ine question.
 
 
W e're going to close in just am oment. I ask you to stay with usf or just a couple of  
m om entsm ore. It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t  Pers on
 
that our First Persongets the last word. So I'm  
going to turnback to Jacqueline to close ourprogram  in just am oment.
 
W hen Jacqueline is 
done, we're going to try to get her up the stairs as quickly as we can, actually up the elevator 

outside the door,because she's going to thetopof  the stairs in thefoyer where 
s h e  will s ig n  

copiesof  her memoir. If youhave the opportunity to talk with Jacqueline then that would be 

great.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being with us. I rem ind you we have a
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program  eachW ednesday andThursday through the m iddleof  August. Perhaps you can com e 

back and join usthis year and if notmaybe in af uture year.W ehope you can com eback.
 
 
So with that, I'm  going to turn to Jacqueline to close us outf or today.
 
>> J a
cqueline Mendels Birn:
 
W ell, what I wanted to say is the situation was so desperate.In 
m y book, if you see it upstairs lateron, entitled " A dimancheprochain,"  whichm eans untilnext 

Sunday. Becausem y parents were so desperate, they say that they wished
 
to be alive one 
m ore week
, u
ntil thenext Sunday. And m y sister and Itook itf or granted. AndI just hope that it 
wi ll never happen to you in your lives whether you are young or not so young that it will happen 

that youare ina desperate situation and thatyou want to survive. 
 
 
So Ihope that you live in a better world, actually
, a
nd that there won't be these terrible 
events like in theSudan, Serbia, Syria right now. T hose things have to come toanend. And 

m aybe you can do som ething about it
 t
o im prove the planet.
 
 
T hose are m y words.
