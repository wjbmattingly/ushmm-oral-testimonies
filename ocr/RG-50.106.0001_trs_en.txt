Q: And her maiden name was?      
 
A: K-O-H-N.      
 
Q: K-O-H-N.  Okay .  And I'll ask you some mo
re questions about her as we go along.  At 
the time of your birth, did yo
u have brothers and sisters? 
 
A: No, I am an only child.  
 
Q: And did you remain an only child?
 
A: Yes, yes.
 
Q: What kind of business, or what did 
your father do; do you know?      
 
A: He was originally a banker.  At the time th
e war started, he was forced out of that and 
became a school at a school for 
boys and he taught 
mainly Hebrew Jewish religion.      
 

Q: Do you know the name of the 
school by any ch ance?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: How do you know th at that 
was what he was doing?      
 
A: My mother told me
 about that.      
 
Q: When  you say he was a bank
er, did you know wh at his position was at the bank?      
 
A: No, no idea.      
 
Q: And how about your
 mother -- was she employed?      
 
A: My mother was originally 
an actress.  When that wasn 't possible, she worked for a 
travel agency.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And after that she just was forced ou
t of wo rk. Sh e later on owned a store for 
children's clothing -- infant's and children'
s clothing -- and th at was destroyed in  
Kristallnacht.      
 
Q: And so, by 1939, was she 
still working at all, or was it basically impossible?
 
A: She was still working.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And that would have been s
till the children's clothing store?      
 
A: Right.  Right.      
 
Q: Okay .  Now, let's start with
, I guess, your father's family
 -- brothers, sisters that he 
had.      
 
A: He had a sister and one brother.      
 
Q: And his sister 's name was -- ?      
 
A: Kate.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And I don't reme mber the brother's name .      
 
Q: Was it an older or younger brother?      
 
A: It was an older brother.  
I don't remember his father's 
name.  His mother was her -- 
died wh en  he was a 
small child.      
 
Q: Okay.  Had you ever met his sister?      
 

A: No.  No.      
 
Q: Okay .  Do you know wh
ere she lived, or was she al
so in Berlin?      
 
A: She lived in small town Ge
rmany.  I don't know the name
 of it, b u t it was out in the 
country somewhere. I do know 
wh at happened to her and her brother.  We never heard 
from again.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Why don't you tell me
 what happened to your aunt, I guess.
 
A: She was married.  And on 
the night of her wedding, th
ey killed her husband and she 
committed suicide.      
 
Q: And when was that approximately?      
 
A: '40, '41 -- I'm not 
really sure.      
 
Q: And that would have been in Germany.      
 
A: Yeah, Germany.      
 
Q: And I mean, I know who you're talking a
bout wh en you say "the
y," but do you know 
specifically  it was the SS?      
 
A: SS.      
 
Q: Yeah.  And who told you that?      
 
A: My mother.  These are thi
ngs that my mother told me. 
 Unfortunately, I didn't take 
enough dates down.      
 
Q: Sure.  No, I understand.  Sure.  Now, 
was your father's family originally from 
Germany, or do you know how l
ong they were --      
 
A: They were originally from Germany.  
They were from Gelsenkirchen.      
 
Q: Can you spell that for me?      
 
A: G-E-L-S-E-N-K-I-R-C-H-E-N.      
 
Q: Okay .  And wh ere is that in rela
tion to Berlin, if you know?      
 
A: Not really -- outside.  Small town.      
 
Q: How long had they  been
 in Berlin, your parents, do you know?      
 
A: Actually, my father was living in Gelsenki
rchen and came to Berlin on a business trip 
and met my mother at that time through a friend.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 

A: Actually, my mother was dating his best fri
end. And he was supposed to deliver a note 
to the best friend. And that
's how they met.      
 
Q: It was more than a note he delivered.  
Okay. Let's then go to 
your mother's family 
now.  Did sh e have brothers and sisters?      
 
A: No, she was also an
 only child.      
 
Q: Okay .  And her background was -- was sh
e also German, or do you know where she 
was from?      
 
A: Yes, yes -- her father was from Austria, from Vienna.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And her father's name , can I ask you th at?      
 
A: Her father's name was (?Kamil?)      
 
Q: And that would have been K-O.      
 
A: K-O-H-N.      
 
Q: Okay .  Now, you're born in October of 
1939, and I guess wh at we're going to do is 
rely a little bit on maybe your 
mother's recollection of this
 early period until you had your 
own recollections as a child. 
 But do you know wh at kinds 
of circumstances y ou were 
living in  in Berlin at that 
time from your moth er?  Do you kno
w if you're still in a house, 
an apartment, or?      
 
A: Well, to go back a bit, my  grandmother'
s name was Teresa.  And she converted to 
Judaism when she married my grandfat
her who was a devout Jew.      
 
Q: Okay.  This is on your paternal or --      
 
A: This was my mother's
 mother.  So that lays the back
ground a little more of why things 
happened later on that didn't happen to her.      
 
Q: Okay.  So your maternal grandmother basi
cally converted.  And what was her religion 
before?      
 
A: Protestant.      
 
Q: Protestant.  Okay.  All right.  So the 
circumstances y ou were living in.      
 
A: My grandfather was a prominent person
 in Avatas [?] until stock market and 
everything collapsed.  And he 
lost all.  He die d  in 1935
.  Basically when he lost 
everything, he gave up.  Th
ey were wealthy people, alwa
ys had a live-in maid.  My 
mo ther grew  up in those circumstances.  Went to priv ate schools.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 

A: And, after my grandfather died, my moth
er -- from the little mo ney that he had left -- 
she opened the store to sell th
e children's clothes, started the business.      
 
Q: I see.  T ell me about a little bit -- and 
I'm sorry we're backtracking Mrs. Gelfer, but 
this is interesting.  Tell me a little bit ab
out her career as an 
actress -- what you know 
about it.      
 
A: Mainly on a stage.  In fact, she was star
tin g to make a name for herself.  Small town 
stage productions.  She always wanted to be
 an actress from way back.  She always 
mentioned she dropped out of 
school without her parents kn
owing about it and went to 
acting school.      
 
Q: And did she use her name Johanna?      
 
A: No, her stage name was Junsi.  That was 
a nickname my  grandfather had fo r her.  And 
Karnau, K-A-R-N-A-U, was her stage name.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Do you have
 any memorabilia from that time
 period or anything?      
 
A: I have pictures of her.  She was a slight person.  Very trim.  Boyish figure.  She did 
things like William Tell's son.  Cape Leer's son.
  A lot of these kind of parts.  She did.  
My great grandfather was a ba
llet master of the Vienna opera house, so maybe there was 
a little theatrical book in there 
from the beginning.      
 
Q: And that would have b
een on her side.      
 
A: That's my grandfather's fa
ther.  There are three cousin
s in Austria which are quite 
well-known writers by the name of Brau
n.  That's  B-R-A-U-N.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So she owne
d her children 's store.      
 
A: So sh e was used to the finer things in 
life, born in well-to-do 
situation.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And this was in Berlin.      
 
A: This was.      
 
Q: When was she born; do you know?      
 
A: December 30, 1904.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Back -- going back now to 
1939 time period when  y
ou were first born, 
were you living in an apartm
ent -- just the three of you 
-- or do you know?      
 
A: We were living in an ap
artment with my grandmother -- the four of us.      
 
Q: And that would have been her mo th
er -- your mo th er's mo ther.      
 
A: My moth er's 
mother.      
 

Q: Okay.      
 
A: And we lived in that apartmen
t till we left Germany.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  So, as far as you know, you
 lived in th e same place.      
 
A: All my life.      
 
Q: Okay.  From 1939 to --
 
A: -- 1949.      
 
Q: Okay .  Ten years later.  All right.  Wh at ar
e your first recollections as a child?      
 
A: First recollections, I would say, woul
d be wandering around streets with my  
grandmother not knowing the reason why really.  Da
ys and nights.  I al so had an aunt that 
was really not an aunt; it was just a very cl
ose friend of a cousin 
and later his wife who 
protected us.  And she would pi
ck me up and walk me in park
s and streets.  And I really 
had no id ea why I was doing th is.      
 
Q: Do you know now?      
 
A: Yes, of course.  That was just to hide me.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: I remember my father coming home from wo
rk  and he would put me on his shoulders 
and ride me around th e dining room and my  
mo ther would be saying,
 "You're tired. Don't 
do that."  That's -- my father 
take me to the park.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Bits and pieces there.      
 
Q: Do you know wh at kind of work  
your father was doing then?      
 
A: At that time he was teaching.  He taught
 until the very end when he was.      
 
Q: Okay .  When  was tha
t; do you know?      
 
A: December 22, 1942.  And he was taken 
right out of the classroom.      
 
Q: Do you know wh at happ
ened to him?      
 
A: No.  We just know that there was a sign 
in Berlin where they always had th e -- the 
lists of people who were gone, had died.  
And it just had his number -- 21450 -- and his 
name behind it.  Some said he was on his way 
to ___, but there was no proof of it.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  How are you so certain -- it's just
 interesting Miss Gelfer, that date.      
 

A: The date was my mother went
 to the town hall every day to 
see if his name was there.  
One day the date was there, the number was there.      
 
Q: I see.  N o w, once your father was taken aw
ay, was it just then th
e three of you in the 
house?      
 
A: Three of us, yes.      
 
Q: Now, what I think I'll do, Ms. Gelfer, 
just a little bit easier, 
I'm going to go through 
your recollections first from your childhood to
 the time you were liber
ated essentially to 
almost the present.  And 
th en what I'd like to do is go back
 and so rt of I'll put you in th e 
shoes of your mo ther in a sens
e and have you recollect what 
she has told you about that.  
I think that will be probably a easi
er way to do it as opposed to sk ipping back and forth.      
 
A: I have something that I don't know if you'
d like to use or not, but my  father wrote me a 
poem right after I was born.      
 
Q: Oh, terrific.      
 
A: And it sort of tells what th
ings were like at that time --
 his fear, his knowledge wh at 
was going to  happen.      
 
Q: Oh, th at'd  be great.  Why don't yo
u just take the time n o w.      
 
A: He wrote this to me about four months afte
r I was born.  It was called To Tana.      
 
Q: And that means?      
 
A: My name was Tana.  When I came into 
your room, you stretche
d your little hands to 
the bar of your crib. I heard a sweet quiet si
gh.  You felt free from the loneliness of your 
prison.  You are still such a stranger in this
 world.  In a sense nothing in the end is 
loneliness.  What hatred, fury passion has d
one to us. You smiled and consoled so fast 
from your small grief. Oh put
 out love tied around your co
lorful rich wo rld. Thank you 
for all you have already given us -- me mo ries
 of innocence, purity, and a life gone by.  
Life for ourselves has already vanished so long ago.      
 
Q: Beautiful.      
 
A: So he knew what 
was coming.      
 
Q: Well, if you do
n't mind, I'd like to make a copy of th is.      
 
A: Oh, sure.  I translated th
is from the German.      
 
Q: It's beautiful.  So your 
early recollections were unfor
tunately ju st of wandering 
through the streets. Some early recollections of y
our father's love for you it sounds like.      
 

A: Playing with girlfriends -- 
German girlfriends. Really not knowing that this was out of 
the ordinary  the way life was.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did your mother 
ever speak to  you about your 
father in terms of that he 
had been taken away ?      
 
A: No, not that I remember at al
l.  It was just one day he wa
sn't there.  But, at age two 
and a half, I wouldn't have kn
own the difference.      
 
Q: Sure.  Yeah.  Tell me what you recollect as 
you became an older child 
so to speak.      
 
A: You mean two, three -- and that's my recollections?      
 
Q: Four, five.  Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Well, the main ones have to do with -- 
was the day that we were picked up.  My 
mother was in forced labor, and I was playin
g, little non-Jewish girl, German girlfriend of 
mine -- in the dining room.  And my  mo ther
 came in, and she looked at my  grandmother 
and my  grandmother said, "What 
are you doing home already?  
It's early."  And then sh e 
saw the SS man behind -- standing behind my mo
ther.  And my mother
 just sai d  to my 
friend, "You have to go home now.  Tana 
can't play with you anymore."  And the little 
girl didn't  know why, but she left with this 
sort of look.  And my  mo ther and grandmother 
just looked at each other.  My
 mother told me to go get my
 coat.  I remember I grabbed 
my  teddy bear. And my  mo ther, my  grandmot
her hugged each other, and we just left and 
we were put on a truck.  But I had no id ea wh
ere we were going, what was going on at 
that time.  It was just that I was being ta
ken away from my  playmate. And next thing I 
remember was we were in a place called Aranis
he I was told afterwards.  And.      
 
Q: You just spell that to the best you could.      
 
A: A-R-A-N-I-S-H-E.  And there were a lot of
 buildings there.  A
nd I was separated.  
That was the first time I separated from my mo
ther.  There were a bunch of kids.  And 
there were bunk beds.  And I wasn't going to 
stay there.  And I ran away couple of times. 
And the last time I did find my  mother.  And th
ey allowed me to stay with her.  It was 
actually a place -- a holding place -- until we were
 put on a train.  W e were there for 
about four days or five days.  I just rememb
er being very very scared, because it was the 
first time I was really separated from my moth
er, and I was with all 
these children and I 
didn't  know anybody.  And I was determined I 
was going to find her.  And th e next thing 
I really remember is being in
 Theresienstadt.  My first re
collections were walking with 
my  mo ther and it was a park and it had ol
d swings and all of a sudden my  mother 
screamed.  It was a lad y  walking with a b
lind man pushing a baby carriage.  And my  
mo ther had met one of her earlier very best frie
nds of all places that she had really lost 
contact with.  The gentleman was a first world 
war veteran also lost his eyesight in that 
war. And so, he was sort of a national hero .  Th
at's  why he went to  Theresienstadt, not to 

Auschwitz or anywhere else.  And my moth
er was overjoyed meeting these people. The 
little boy had been born there of all places.  And 
I remember the camp -- 
the barracks.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Tell me 
about that.      
 
A: Lots and lots of people in
 dark barracks.  The lice you could just take off the walls.  
Fleas.  Smells.      
 
Q: Describe the smells.      
 
A: Waste.  Human waste.  Just foul odors.
  You tried to open the door, but not mu ch 
better outside.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I remember being fed.  We used to go 
outside. And they had these big barrels.  And it 
was filled with what they called "soup."  And,
 if you are at the beginning of the line, you 
get maybe a little meat or something.  If you we
re at the end of the line, you just get the 
water and a crust of bread would go with that. 
We used to save the crust of bread for a 
couple of days as long as we could, beca
use when it got hard, you could make it last 
longer.  So we'd  eat it after a few days. My 
mo ther and I would sit together, and we just 
eat little pieces at a time.      
 
Q: How often were you given these meals; was it just once a day?      
 
A: Once a day.      
 
Q: What -- midday, early day?      
 
A: Early day.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I spent a lot of my time in a hospital th
ere. I had every disease and every ch ildhood 
illness that -- measles and mumps.  Of course
, with all these children there, you'd  catch 
whatever so meone else had.  I had intestinal infection twice -- it almost killed me.  One 
time I remember I needed a bl
ood transfusion.  And then 
they put my mo
ther on one 
table, put me on the other table and a tube we
nt from her into me.  Saved my life anyway.  

I remember that a lot of people
, they didn't speak German, es
pecially in the hospital -- the 
kids. There were not th at many Germans there.
  And I was totally lost language-wise.  
We -- when I wasn 't sick, while my mother
 was doing various jobs there, we were 
allowed to attend a day camp, which was run by,
 you know, inmates, girls.  And there we 
were allowed to paint and draw
 pictures.  We worked with 
little tiles.  You know, a few 
little toys for us.  But even th
ere they made -- the Nazis ma
de sure that we would be 
impressed and would reme mb er our experien ces
 as small as we were.  When the people 
were brought in -- mainly the men were brou
ght in from the outside, they were half 

starved -- and th is was Czechoslovakia.  An
d this was December, th is was winter, it 
snows like Russian snows -- they
 would be taken off the cart
s.  And these were skeleton 
of people.  And they  were going by outsid
e the windows.  And 
they would open the 
drapes for us.  And we were made to watc
h them move on until they
 dropped dead.  And 
this is -- I do remember this was something 
my mother never really knew that I knew -- 
never told  us.  This was something I actua
lly do remember.  They made sure -- people 
say now, you know, "How can you rememb er th
ings wh en you were four years old?"  Bu t 
things like that you d
on't forget.      
 
Q: Now, were you in  a separate barracks from your mo ther?      
 
A: No, I was together -- I was lucky I was toge
ther with my mother 
in the same barracks 
at the time, except when I wa
s in the hospital.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And in terms of these -- when 
you say that these -- these men were taken 
off --      
 
A: They were just brought in --      
 
Q: -- from trains.      
 
A: -- from trains --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- and they were just made to stand ther
e.  And this was before they had -- were 
building the gas chambers there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So these people were sick already.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they were half-starved.  And, of co
urse, they were freezing.  And they were -- 
they were nude.      
 
Q: And they  would just leave them
 out in the elements.      
 
A: They would just leave them out there.  A
nd we just -- they opened these big drap es.  

And we just -- we turned aro
und and watched them.      
 
Q: Now, in terms of your actual living c
onditions in the barracks, were you -- did you 
share a bed your mother, or shared a bu
nk with several other people?      
 
A: We had bunks.  Bunks.  They were th
ree and three high, the bunks.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did you always have the 
same  place; do you rememb er?      
 

A: I imagine so.  I would think so, yes.  B
ecause my mother used to talk about barrack 
number.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did you have -- do you reme
mb er being able to keep any personal 
possessions there?      
 
A: My teddy bear.  I still have my teddy bear.      
 
Q: You still have it?      
 
A: My teddy bear came home with me.      
 
Q: How do you -- just out of curios
ity, how is it kept now?      
 
A: It's just on my 
bookshelf.      
 
Q: Oh, really.  Okay.      
 
A: Couple of times I'v e had him fixed a little bit.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I sent a few things to the museum.  Mone
y from Theresienstadt.  Postcards that we -- 
my mother was allowed to send
 out, which were kind of a j
oke.  And I was ready to  send 
the teddy bear, but I couldn't do it.      
 
Q: No, you don't want to do that
.  It's made it this far with
 you; it seems to me it doesn 't 
leave your house.      
 
A: Right.  Yes.  Yes.  And he still got th
e same -- my mother kn
itted me for Hanukkah 
there over in the camp; she kn
itted me a little outfit for him. 
 And he's still got that on 
him.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did you name your 
teddy bear by any chance?      
 
A: No, I did not.      
 
Q: Okay .  Can you -- besides that the couple
 vignettes that you to ld me about the camp  
life, is there anything else that
 sticks out in your mind -- 
any other people that you can 
recall, you know, distinctly or relationships 
that you might have 
had or things that 
impressed you?      
 
A: Mainly the couple that we met there, as
 I said -- he was blinded WWI and taken to 
Theresienstadt because he was sort of a wa
r hero.  And they were
 little careful about 
killing these people right out.  And his wife was a secretary to him.  He was a lawyer -- 
an attorney -- I mentio
ned that.  And sh e was a secretary. When  he came back and was 
blinded, they married.  She was 
always a sickly person.  And th
ey  tried very hard to have 
children; nothing ev er happen
ed .  After they wound up in  Theresienstadt, she became 

pregnant.  And my  mo ther says that -- told 
me that friends -- so woman friends -- helped 
her have her child in secret there; othe
rwise, the child woul
d have been killed.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they were there for over three years. 
 So they  had been  there a year -- two years 
before us already.      
 
Q: Do you know what th
eir names are?      
 
A: Yes.  Minnie and Fritz Simon.      
 
Q: S-I-M-O-N?      
 
A: Mm-hmm.  And the son's name is Michael.      
 
Q: Do you know if he
 survived?      
 
A: They all survived.  And last we heard of 
them, they were -- when we came over here -
- her brother was a friend of my  mo ther's also
 in Germany.  He remained in Germany.  
And he gave us their address.  And they 
wound up in Mt. Vernon
, New York.      
 
Q: Okay.  Hmm.      
 
A: We saw them several times ev en after I ma
rried. My husband met him.  My children.  
Michael went on to become a doctor.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Frits went -- frits w ent back to Germany 
and remained there.  And I -- we didn't hear 
that she died, but I -- she must have died.  And 
then last we heard of 
them, we went by to 
their wedding -- to Michael's  wedding.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: And then we lost track of the son.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  He would be about -- no, he
'd  be younger than you, I guess, right?  
Because he was just a baby -- thre
e or four years younger.      
 
A: He would be two years older than me.      
 
Q: No, that doesn 't quite match.      
 
A: He was younger than me, I'm sorry
, younger than me -- yes.      
 
Q: Because he was in the baby carria
ge and you were st
anding.      
 
A: Right.  Right.  Younger -- right.  
They were there two years more.      
 

Q: Right.  So two to three years.      
 
A: Two to three years younger -- right.      
 
Q: What about the -- the Nazis at the camp; do 
you recall?  Do you have any memories of 
what they were like beside
s forcing you to  see those certain things?      
 
A: No.  Really really not, because I came more  into contact with -- 
in the children's camp, 
with the inmates.  And also in 
the hospital -- the doctors and nurses
 were also inmates.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: The people in prison ____.      
 
Q: Tell me about that --      
 
A: I do have a recollection -- go back to before
 we left Germany.  A German officer -- he 
was not an SS officer, but he 
was in  th e army .  His n ame  was Z immerman . At t h at time 
my  mo ther had to take on a middle name, which was a Hebrew name -- Sarah --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- which, of course, she wasn't  used to, 
because she wasn't born with that name.  And 
when ever she had to go somewhere and sign her na
me, that name had to be included --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- otherw ise, it would mean instant death w
ith deportation.  Well, one time my mother 
had to go somewhere and she ha
d to sign some papers and she ju st forgot.  She just put 
her regular name down.  They ca
ught her.  It was an excuse 
to deport somebody.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: This Mr. Zimmerman was a friend of ours.  
He lived a couple of houses away from us 
in Berlin and had been  bringing us a little 
food and was friendly with my mother -- well, 
my  grandmother.  An d he saw the papers on th
e desk that she was su
pposed to be picked  
up.  And he took the papers, and he came  to my  house.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And he said, "Look, Katsina[?], what y
ou did -- stupid thing you 
did -- you didn't  put 
your name down , your Hebrew na
me."  And my mother says, "I 
just bluntly forgot.  I just 
wanted to  get out of there and forgot."       
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 

A: And he said, "This paper is 
out for you.  These are the papers.  They 're official."  And 
she said, "Well, that's what ha
s to be."  And he says, "I ca
n't do this." And he burned th e 
papers.      
 
Q: Hmm.      
 
A: And they went out and killed him.  A
nd I remember h im, because he was a very 
heavy-set man with a big mu stache.  I always 
cried.  He picked me up, and he loved me 
to death.  And I always screamed 
when he picked me up.      
 
Q: Did you hear from your mo
ther that he had been killed, I guess, later?      
 
A: Yes, yes.  From my  grandmother, actually
.  When we came ba
ck from the camp, she 
told us that she h
eard that he had been killed.      
 
Q: Now just digressing a little bit -- I guess your
 grandmother wasn't ta
ken because --      
 
A: My grandmother was not ta
ken, because she was born Prot
estant and converted.  She 
was 70 years old at the time.  And they hadn
't  quite made up their mind what to do with 
her.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: I think the reason that we went so late 
was that -- also becaus
e my  mo ther had been 
asked to come down to be measured.  Her he
ad was measured, her nose was measured to 
see how much of her was Jewi
sh and how much of her wasn
't.  So it took th em a little 
longer to take us, because they couldn't  
quite make up their mind where she belonged, 
because she didn't come from a 
Jewish mother --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  So technically --      
 
A: -- technically.      
 
Q: Although the -- I guess the code back th
en was like 1/64th or something.  I mean, it 
didn't  ____ .      
 
A: Right.      
 
Q: Just to finish up a little b
it with Theresienstadt.  Do yo
u remember -- in other words, 
oftentimes people tell us about 
the -- either the concerts or cu
ltural events that they had.  
Do you rememb er any of that?      
 
A: No -- only from -- not mysel
f.  Only from what 
my mother said th
at the Red Cross 
came in, an d they sp ruced 
up the camp.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: The banks were opened.  Th
e cafes were opened.      
 

Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Bakeries had food in them.  Butcher shops 
had food in them.  And, of course, it was 
just a big show.      
 
Q: Sure.      
 
A: These were things that she told me.  It 
was just for the Red Cross.  I remember also 
my  mo ther said that the Red Cross questioned 
them and said, "Well, how is life here?"  
And, of course, they couldn't say too mu ch , beca
use there was always someone listening.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So the answer they gave wa
s, "I mu st say it's not too bad.
"  And th at can be taken two 
ways.  And they hoped it would be picked 
up in the way that they said.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Back on around the second hal
f, and we have two more, so --      
 
A: Oh.      
 
Q: -- we're in pretty good sh ape.      
 
A: You had just asked if I knew wh at my  mo ther did.      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: She had several jobs.  One was 
working in the fields.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: She picked spinach.  She 
pick ed rhubarb .  She got that 
job.  They asked if anybody 
had any farming experience.  And my mother
 was always outspoken,
 brazen, and kind of 
gutsy .  If she wasn't gutsy, she wouldn't  have 
made it through all this.  She said, "Oh su re 
-- I have farming experience."      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And someone said, "Well, you came from 
Berlin; there's no farms there."  And she 
said, "Well, I grew flowers in my window at home."      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Whoever she was talking to had a sense of
 humor an d figured she was young, she was 
strong, and put her in the fields.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: They tried to steal spin
ach, put it in their underw ear. 
 And rhubarb.  She fed the 
rhubarb to  me once. She was overjoyed that
 she had some rhubarb.  Well, with the 

intestinal problems I had, it almost killed me.  
But they tried to steal
 what they could out 
of the fields.      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er eating some of 
the things from the fields?      
 
A: I remember the rhubarb, because I al
most died right af
ter that.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Another job she had was wh en the people ca
me into the camp they had showers.  And, 
as I said before, very few of 
the people spoke German.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: And that was -- she didn't  speak any othe
r language.  These were showers with water, 
but these people didn't know th at.  They  ha
d heard about the gas chambers.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they wanted to de-lic
e them, de-flea them before they
 came in.  And she was one 
of the people that had to take these women 
into the showers.  Of course, these p eople 

were screaming and yelling thinking that they
 were going to their death.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Another job she had was se
parating belo ngings of people that had died th ere.  
Assembly-line type of work .  The Nazis wanted
 any kind that was valuable -- jewelry.  
Anything at all that co uld be of use to them
. And so, they had thes
e boxes, which literally 

had the ashes -- remains of the people in th em, 
and they had to go through th em.  A lot of 
times the name on them would be somebody 
that somebody would recognize, a son or 
daughter or husband.      
 
Q: Hmm.  Just to backtrack a 
little bit, Mrs. Gelfer, I'd lik e to
 talk a little bit more about 
the hospital.  You said that it was staffed by 
inmates.  D o  you remember what, you know, 
physically looked like -- the 
physical plant so to speak.
 
A: Just barrack-type beddings. 
 Very, very simple. Everythi
ng that was used there was 
chipped -- the bowls.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Nobody asked from facilities fo r buckets.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Somewhat less cro w de
d than the barracks?      
 
A: Yes, but not -- single beds, no
t bunk-style beds --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 

A: -- that was the difference.  Ju
st children where I was.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  So you assume that th
ere's a children's section?      
 
A: A children 's section -- yes.      
 
Q: How many kids were in the --      
 
A: There were a lot I remember -- a lot.  But 
I don't remember -- maybe say 100, 75 --      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er being liber
ated from the camp?      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Can you tell me about that?      
 
A: Yes, I remember th at -- well,
 the background of it was that
 -- w h at my mother told me 
first before -- what I remember
 was that the night before th
ey had posted a sign that we 
were supposed to be gassed the next morning.
  They already had built the chambers.  Let 
me just go back one more -- that just br
ings something else to mind.      
 
Q: Sure.  Mm-hmm.      
 
A: When we first came in, "Tan
a" was a very popular name 
at that time.  The children 
that were born around 1939 -- 
'38, '39 -- the parents were not
 allowed to give them names 
of their choices.      
 
Q: Hmm.      
 
A: There was a list of names.  They were
 horrendous names a lot of them.  Abiga -- 
which is Abigail here, which isn't too bad, but 
in German, it's  the clos
est thing to a parrot, 
which is papagei.  So  these were
 not very nice names.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So Tana was about the best.  I guess ther
e were about six or seven girl's names and 
boy's name s.  And the parents had to choose from the list.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So "Tana" was a popular name of little girl
s at that time.  We 
were brought into the 
camp.  We had to line up.  And Ko hn -- my  mo
ther used -- after my 
father was picked up, 
my mother though
t she can protect us a little better by 
using her name -- maiden name of 
Kohn.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: That also, of course, was a very popular
 name. When we were brought in, we were 
told to line up.  And, if it wa
sn't a confusion, excitement, ev
erything that was going on.  

They knew that the na
mes they were calling were the na
mes that were not going to  stay 
in Theresienstadt; they were goi
ng to go to  Au schwitz or to one of the other camp s.  And 
my  mo th er ju st reme mb ers " F
rau Kohn and child Tana."  
And my  mo ther took me -- and 
I do remember she took me and pulled me 
forward.  And a woman grabbed her by the 
sleeve and pulled her back and said, "Didn't yo
u hear the first name ?  That's me and my  
daughter."      
 
Q: Hmm.  And they  ste
pped forward?      
 
A: They stepped forward.      
 
Q: Did you know at that point -- or did you 
later sense how important that was?  I guess 
you must have.      
 
A: Later on -- yeah.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Well, anyway back to liberation.  We we
re supposed to be gassed the following day, 
so.  And, from what I understood later is that 
the next morning we were liberated.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: So it was a ma tter of hours.  They kept us th
ere for two weeks mainly to treat us --      
 
Q: When  you say "they," was it the Ru ssians that --      
 
A: Russians.  Clean us up -- get the lice out of the hair.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I was so weak.  I was so weak that I had 
to be trained how to walk at that time.  I 
couldn't walk under my  own power.  And we were
 just set free.  They
 opened the gates, 
and we were set free.  And th
e only place we knew wh ere to go 
was back to Berlin.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: We walked for a while.  We hitched a 
ride on a hay wagon.  And I reme mb er we 
stopped at a farm.      
 
Q: And this is you and your mo ther.      
 
A: Me and my mother, yes. 
 My mother and I.  We walk
ed by a farm, and the farmer 
came out.  And he must have realized who 
we were, where we'r e coming from.  And he 
invited us in.  And he gave 
me so me g o at mi lk .  And  I ju st reme mb er my  mo th er was so  
upset, because I wouldn't drink it. 
 I just -- I just didn't  like 
it, and I didn't  drink it.  And 
she was so thrilled that I was going 
to get some nourishment.      
 

Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And we mainly hitched rides until we got
 back to Berlin.  
And just continuous 
process.  A lot of people did it.  A
nd a lot of people stopped to help.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And the next thing I really rememb er was 
we were in Berlin and it was a big indoor 
market -- about three, four bl
ocks away from us -- and we were running. That's the first 
thing I remember --      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: -- because we used to shop
 there before.  And I knew we 
were close to home.  And my 
grandmother had no knowledge of us 
that we were coming back.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: There was no way to get in touch with her.  
And sh e didn't  know if we were dead or if 
we were alive at that time.  And we walked
 up to the apartment 
door.  And my  mo ther 
pushed me ahead of her.  She didn't know if 
this was going to  kill my grandmother from 
shock or wh at was going to  happen.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: She was in her 70's already.  She rang th
e doorbell and stepped aside and just had me 
standing there.  My grandmother opened th e 
door, she just saw me . Well, of course she 

went hysterical from crying, but she also thou
ght that my mother didn't make it.  And 
then my mother stepped fo
rward.  And I remember that.  Crying.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And your grandmother had just 
basically lived at the same apartment and 
stayed there?
 
A: Yes, she had stayed there.  Ye
s, she had stayed there.      
 
Q: Now, wh en you moved back
 into your grandmother's ap
artment or your apartment, 
what did you -- what do you recall of those days?      
 
A: First thing my mother says, "We got to ge
t out of Germany as quick ly as possible."  
And she just -- and the people, when we came back, all of a sudden the next door 
neighbors that have turn ed us in -- or someon
e who did turn us in 
probably befo re -- were 
our dearest friends, "Oh, we'r e so glad you ma
de it.  We're so happy to see you.  And so 
glad to have you back ."  And my  mo
ther said, "That's it.  We just ha
ve to get out of here."      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 

A: So we put in for a reserve 
for displaced person to come to 
the United States.  At that 
time we had an option of goin
g either to Israel or the United States. My grandmother 
wanted to go to Israel.  She 
fought my  mo ther all the way.  And my  mo ther had a friend 
from Berlin who had gone to Israel also with his daughter Tana.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they  had surviv ed.  The family had su
rvived and went to Is
rael.  And they wrote 
my mother and said, "Don't  
come .  You're without a husband.  You're going to be 
separated from your daughter.  You're going 
to have to wo rk.  Without a man you can't 
start in a new country like this
.  Go to the United States instead."  He was a doctor, and 

she was a nurse.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And he said, "We never see our Tana.  
We never see each other.  We're working so 
hard to make a go of it.  Don't come here." 
 My  mo th er mad e th e 
decision to go to the 
United States.      
 
Q: While you were waiting for the visa --      
 
A: While I was waiting, I was sent by the Jewi sh Counsel to Switzerland for three months 
to basically get my  strength back .      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And I went there by my self.  Jewish peopl
e in Switzerland near Bern -- I really don't 
recall the name offhand of the 
town -- took me in.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And I lived with them four months 
and went to school there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: I also did my first three years of public 
school being the only Jewish child in  Berlin 
when I came back there.
 
Q: You say you were the only Je
wish child in Berlin?      
 
A: In my school in Berlin, I 
was the only one left.      
 
Q: Oh, I see.  Mm-hmm.      
 
A: There just were figures in Theresienstadt
. There were 15,000 children that entered and 
went thro ugh th at camp.  And 100 of 
us walked out of there.      
 
Q: 100.      
 

A: 100 out of 15,000.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  After coming back from Switzerland,
 do you -- did you go
 back to school?  
I guess you said --      
 
A: I went back to school.  Went to Switzerla
nd '47, 1947, for three months and just went 
to school up to third 
grade in 1949.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Do you rememb
er what school was like then?  I mean, were kids 
unfriendly, friendly; was it pleasant, unpleasant?      
 
A: No.  I was just different.  They had religio
us training.  And I went
 out in the courty ard 
and played  by my self while they had religio
us training, because I was the only Jewish 
child.  But other than -- no, not 
really. I had friends.  I had no 
problems at all.  And it was 
in November -- end of October actually.  We 
had six days to get ready to  leave Germany.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Your mother -- what kind of wo
rk , or wh at did she do when  she got back  
to Berlin?      
 
A: She work ed fo r th
e town hall, the city hall. City hall.  
Town hall.  I don 't remember.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And when you got 
the notice that you were able
 to -- your visa had been 
approved, was it for the three of you 
-- your grandma as well?      
 
A: For the three of us, yes.      
 
Q: And how did you -- did you come stra
ight to the United States?      
 
A: We came straight to the United States.  We
 were supposed to come in to the port of 
New York.  We went by ship, 
got caught in a storm, and we 
were diverted into Boston.  
We spent one night in Boston
.  Very very elemental.  ____ which we were.  And then 
they put us on a train 
to New York.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And we were met by someone from the Je
wish Council in New York , and they had a 
room waiting for us in New York.      
 
Q: When  you say "a room," 
what do you mean?      
 
A: A room in a private home.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: People rented a room to us.  And it was the three of us in one room.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Do you rememb
er much about that crossi
ng or that ship?      
 

A: A lot of people getting very
 very sick.  It was a battle
ship, not a luxury liner or 
anything.  My mo ther was deathly sick.  We 
were 350 people, and the room we were in, 
we were in hammocks.  Pers
on on top would become ill, a
nd everybody else would profit 
by it.  What you became ill with, you had to  clean
 up.  There was no crew to do that for 
you.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: The sailor's plate with oranges.  And I 
never had even seen an orange, no less eaten 
one.  But because there were walls, we didn't get a
ny of them.  It w as not a kind trip.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: First time I ate a banana, nobody to ld me 
you're supposed to peel them.  And I was 
almo st 10 years old already.  I never had a ba
nana.  So  I bit into it. My grandmother was 
in a room with four, five people, because she was over 70.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And she was the least sick. 
 But my  mo ther was deathly sick in the crossing.  They  
showed us movies of what the Un ited States
 was going to be like.  I mean, it was gold-
paved all over the streets.  And we were going to
 all be very wealthy, taken care of.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  You said it was a 
battleship.  Was it a --      
 
A: It was a navy -- navy ship.      
 
Q: U.S. navy, or do you know?      
 
A: U.S. navy.      
 
Q: Okay .  Any other people that you kne
w from Berlin that came o v er?      
 
A: No.  No one.  No one.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  So it sailed from -- I guess Ber lin is not a port, but whatever.      
 
A: Uh-huh.      
 
Q: Okay .  So you 're in Newark in
 someone's home. You say you stay
 there for some time.      
 
A: We rented a room there.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: When we got here, the Jewish Council ga
ve my  mo ther -- I think it was $30 or $33 
and a newspaper to get a job.  So sh e didn't
 know th e language, she spoke no English, and 
had no training in anything really that she c
ould do with our language,
 so she got a job as 

a seamstress in a factory.  
She was also instructed to pa
y those $33 back as soon as 
possible.      
 
Q: Hmm.      
 
A: And I don't remember -- the rent wasn't
 that high, but it was by a German-Jewish 
family that had come here before the war.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And they  rented rooms.  They had a very  
large colonial house, and th ey rented rooms.  
And we had basically one
 bedroom in their home with kitche
n privileges in the basement.  
And we lived there almost close to a year.  Th
ey  sold  the house, and we mo ved with them 
into their next house.  So
 we stayed with these peopl
e for quite a while.      
 
Q: And, if you could, Mrs. Gelfer, just give 
me sort of a sketch of
 what your life was like 
down the years after the war.      
 
A: Well, I went to -- like, when I came here, th
ey put me into fifth 
grade.  When I left 
Germany, I left in third grade not kn
owing a word  of English.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: You had to either learn th
e language quick ly, or you were going to be in th e fifth 
grade for a long time.  So I cau
ght on pretty quickly.  I was a 
little h esitant at first to open 
my mouth, because in the end I was different
 and I was afraid people were going to 
laugh.  But they weren't; they 
were very helpful.  People ev
en asked me to come  over in 
the evenin g and helped me study th e language
.  My mo ther remarri
ed in 1952.  She 
worked for a baking company, 
and she met my step
father there.  An
d things got a little 
bit easier after that. We moved 
ag ain into Irvington.  I did mo st of my  growing up in 
Irvington, New Jersey.  Went to grammar sch ool
, high school there.  My mother was able 
to buy their own house.      
 
Q: Your stepfather's name is or was?      
 
A: Archie Anklowitz.  A-
N-K-L-O-W-I-T-Z      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did he have children of his own?      
 
A: No.  No, he didn't h ave child
ren.   ____ about eight years ago.  And my  mo th er died in 
1991.      
 
Q: So, after you went throu
gh American schools, did you 
end up going to 
high school, I 
guess, in Irvington, or?      
 
A: High school in Irvington, yes. 
 Irvington High School.      
 

Q: Okay .  And then  wh
at happened?      
 
A: And worked for an insura
nce company.  And from there on to a title company.  I 
worked with atto
rneys doing closings in the title company.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And then  met my  husband, Donald.      
 
Q: When did you guys get married ?      
 
A: 1967 -- '66 -- I'm so rry.      
 
Q: And do you ha
ve any ch ildren?
 
A: Yes.  We have a daughter, 26 -- Karen.  A
nd a son, Steven, who's just about 24.      
 
Q: Good name.      
 
A: Right.      
 
Q: And do you wo rk  with your daughter now?      
 
A: No, my  daughter's in advertising.  She's on he
r own.  My son just graduated college.      
 
Q: What's  he studying?  What's h e doing?      
 
A: He's working for a company doing computer
 work. And eventually he wants to go on 
to a -- he's going back to school
 to do a bit more learning on computer science.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  I bet he could figure out how to 
work this tape recorder.  And what kind of 
work are you doing now?      
 
A: Oh, I work for Sears & Roebuck.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And Mr. Gelfer, what kind of work
 do you do?      Speaker H:  I retired 
about a year ago.  Ab out two years ago.      
 
A: From the post office.      
 
Q: All right.  Let's go back, if we could, 
to your mo ther, which is obviously important 
influence and to ld you a lot of 
things about -- and again, this
 is -- I know we'v e sort of 
gone thro ugh so me of it already, some of the 
things that she told you.  Are there any other 
kinds of -- and, I guess, if we take them 
chronologically -- sort of
 high point -- not 'h igh 
point', that's a terrible use of
 wo rds.  But, you know, anything -- kinds of experiences that 
you remember she told you about that you'd like to share?      
 

A: Basically, what I've menti
oned on here are the things that
 I remember her telling me.  
When we came back from the 
concentration camp and my 
mother was working in the 
city hall, she met a young man.  Sh e was lonely.  An
d they  started to build  a relationship.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: He was Hungarian, I believe.  And he aske
d her to marry him.  And he knew that my  
mo ther had put in a visa to come
 to the United States.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And he kept putting the marriage off a
nd said, "When you get your visa, we'l l go 
together.  We'll go together." 
 And one day she got a letter to
 come down to fill out some 
more forms -- some kind of fo
rmality.  And sh e went down -- and I can 't quite remember 
how it was, but she was in the office and 
she had to put down  how many people were 
going to come to the United States with her.  
And she put down "and 
her fiancé," and put 
down the person's name.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: And the young man work ing behind the de
sk looked  at the name and was kind of 
bewildered .  And he said, "Just a minute."  He
 went out of the room, and he came back 
again, and he said, "I have something I have
 to tell you.  I don't know how to put it.  But 
this man has been engaged several times to 
Jewish wo men who want to get out of the 
country.  We're looking fo r him.  He's one 
of the biggest Nazi war criminals.  A man 
trying to  use women to get out of the country ."      
 
Q: Did she -- was she able to give him his name?      
 
A: She did give him the name, but then she ju
st -- she didn't say anything to him.  She 
just broke it off with him.  Lu
ckily we were able to leave right -- soon after that.      
 
Q: Do you remember what 
his name was?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: That's all right.      
 
A: It's a real Hungarian name.  I wouldn't
 re memb er h is  last n a
me anyway.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  But you remember
 him -- I mean, you remember
 coming to the house, and 
--      
 
A: Oh, yes -- I remember him.  Yes.  Very charming.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  And he wasn't the only one probably.      
 

A: No.  No.  And, of course, these women we
re very lonely.  They
 were young women.  
Very vulnerable to emotions.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Did your mo ther tell you mu ch  as you got older about wh at she needed to  
do to hide her identity in Berlin
, you know, before you were take
n to Theresienstadt?      
 
A: What do you mean by "h
ide her identity?"      
 
Q: Well, not so much --      
 
A: I mean, she had to wear the star.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: She wore that -- I mean, sh
e had to wear that. She was in
 forced labor.  So, when she 
walked in , she kind of had that star on.      
 
Q: So basically she liv
ed in -- I'm sorry to 
interrupt you, Mrs. Gelfer, but she lived in 
Berlin as a Jew.  I mean, she was not.      
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Well, everyone 
knew that she was a Je
w.  H er neighbors knew 
she was a Jew.      
 
Q: I guess we're discussing now just a little abou
t your mother's ex peri
ence in Berlin, just 
in '38, '39 time period.  But as you recall, sh
e told you -- I mean, she 
had to do everything 
that was required.      
 
A: She had to do everything. 
 One time she told me that sh
e went out, and she had to go 
deliver something to her town 
hall.  And there was a Nazi o
fficer there.  And she wasn't 
wearing her star.  She was just
 -- she just sai d  she had it. 
 She wanted to use public 
transportation to  get there, and she took th e star
 off.  She didn't thi
nk she was going to get 
asked into the office.  She t
hought she would just drop this
 off and turn around. Well, 
they asked her to go in, and there was this big 
Nazi officer sitting there.  And he looked at 
her, and he said -- started to 
question her -- and she got very 
nervous.  And he said, he 
was just ready to  ask her, "Aren't you a Je
w?" wh en the phone rang.  And he got the 
message that they captured ten or 12 Jews an
d they were able to 
execute them, and he 
was just delighted with that.  
My mother just ran for the hills
 -- just took off. Ran out of 
there.  He was so distracted by that.  But othe
r than that, she had to 
wear the star at all 
times. My grandmother didn't.      
 
Q: Grandmother did not.      
 
A: No, Grandmother did not.      
 
Q: Did you get -- you were taken to Ther
esienstadt wh at -- 1942, '4 3?      
 
A: No, I'm sorry, '44 -- Septem
ber 1944, and we were releas
ed in June '45.      
 

Q: Okay .  Do you have any se
nse, Mrs. Gelfer, how many Jews there were in Berlin in 
1944?  I mean, I know you were really you
ng, but did your mo ther sort of say "There 
were a lot of us around," or?      
 
A: No.  No, not that I remembe
r.  I didn 't even know what a Je
w was at that time.      
 
Q: Yeah.  Right.  But I mean, 
from your mo th er's recollection, 
it just -- it seems --      
 
A: Only from what she told me
 that when she was younger th
e circle of friends she had, 
people that she went to school with.  She tr
aveled -- not to sound 
snobbish, but she used 
to travel in artisti
c circle.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And college professors.  And they were all litera
ry people.  Most of them were Jews.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And she lost track of all of them.  Except fo
r this one couple that I mentioned.  We did 
meet -- when we came over, one day we were
 walking in New York -- one of the main 
shopping streets going shopping, my  mo ther
 and I.  An d this woman passed her and 
stopped, and she stopped.  And they looked 
at each other and said, "You look familiar."  
And it was a next, a friend or an acquaintance 
from Berlin that she re
ally had lost total 
contact with.  And they met in the street
s of New York of all places.      
 
Q: Hmm.  Small world some
times.  It's  kind of crazy.
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: Do you know how your gr
andmother was able to surviv
e in Berlin while you guys 
were gone?      
 
A: She had food stamps.  Her 
sister's son was very helpfu
l to her.  He lived a couple 
blocks away.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And since he was Protestant, he had food
.  And there was even people in Germany at 
that time.  And he helped her ou
t and watched over her, visited her and watched over her.      
 
Q: Now, these relatives -- the German relativ es
 so to speak -- do you 
keep in touch with 
any of them?      
 
A: I call this person Un cle Julie.  He's 10 year
s older than my mother.  As I say, it was 
my  grandmother's sister's son.  Being th at mu
ch older than I, he b
ecame my Uncle Julie.  
When my mother es
tablishedherself a little bit overhere
, she got a visa for him to come 

over.  Sh e had a job waiting for him.  She did the same bakery, wh ich was a large place 
where they make pies in case it 
wasn 't a small bakery.      
 
Q: More commercial.      
 
A: Commercial type.  Baking institution.  An
d she got a visa and got him over.  And then  
his stepdaughter -- he had married this wo
man that was a bit younger who many times 
saved me by just grabbing me at night wh en  my
 mo ther would go over and say, "They're 
looking for us -- hide in one pl
ace.  But it's  Tana that they'r
e really looking for."  And she 
walked with me endlessly -- blocks, whatever
 -- kept me  in her house. And sh e had two 
children.  And until it became ve
ry uncomfortable for her.  Of course, her kids were blue-
eyed; they  were blond, German-looking.  Just 
the opposite of me.  No way could I pass as 
one of her children.  And my  
mo ther finally said to her, "Don't do this; you're going to  get 
yourself into trouble.  I won't allo w it.  
You have two small children."  And ju st Julie 
married this lady.  She had two children fro
m a previous marriage.  Her husband was 
killed in the war before that. And my 
mother brought him 
over.  And then his 
stepdaughter.  And then  later on his son and 
his stepson. So they  all came over.  My 
mo ther slowly with  visas brought them over.      
 
Q: And I assume that he's probably passed aw ay.      
 
A: Yes, he's passed away.  He's ten years ol
der than my mother.  Passed away.  And his 
wife also passed away.  I am still 
in contact with his son.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  Who lives in New Jersey.      
 
A: Actually, his stepson too.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Yes, they're all in New Jersey.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  What about you
r father's  family -- do you 
know anything?      
 
A: Nothing at all -- never heard about them.  
And my  mo ther figured if his father would 

have surv ived or his brother, they knew wh
ere we lived.  We never moved away from 
Grimmstrasse, we would have th ought they  woul
d have tried to get in touch with us.  My 
mother tried to inquire several places and tim
es and was never able to find out anything 
about them.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  She had to assume th
ey just didn't make it.      
 
A: Yes.      
 
Q: The store that she had -- your mo ther had 
in Berlin -- the childre
n's store.      
 

A: She ran it herself.  My uncle
 -- Uncle Julie -- he at that 
time was also in the business 
of making pocketbooks.  He wa
s a fashion designer initially, but with the war went down 
the drain.  But he made pocket
books and odds and ends like th
at.  So he was able to get 
her materials to make the things.  My gran
dmother made the panties and outfits in our 
home.  I rememb er sitting and snipping with 
scissors, kept me busy snipping them apart 
as she sewed them on the machine.      
 
Q: But it was owned -- I mean, it was one 
of the Jewish-owned 
businesses that was 
identified as a Jewish
- o wned business; do you
 recall?      
 
A: No, she owned the store until it was destroyed.      
 
Q: Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Your mother did.      
 
A: Yes, because my grandfather had a will a
nd the money he left in the will she used 
towards that.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: Basically, when we came back, the only pe
ople aside from the family, what there was 
-- a member that was there 
that rememb ered us and wa
ited for us was -- when I 
mentioned before this family that met us in
 Theresienstadt -- Fritz Simon.  Her brother 
survived.  He was in Germany.  He went in
to a mental institution 
and declared himself 
insane to hide.  And he spent three and a half 
years in a mental institution.  And the only 
one on to  him was his nurse -- not a Jewish  woman.  And she kept his secret.  
Unfortunately, after th ree and a half years of 
living in  a mental institution, his problems 
were just unbelievable.  He did come out.  He 
did marry her.  She stopped by him.      
 
Q: The nurse.      
 
A: The nurse.  His whole emotional being 
was -- problems after a while.  You don't live 
among in sane people fo r that long.      
 
Q: Or fake to be insane.      
 
A: And fake to be insane.
 
Q: Hmm.  It's got to take its toll.  I mean, 
it's  obviously an  act of
 desperation.  Do you 
reme mb er any actual physical abus
e at Theresienstadt?      
 
A: No.  No.      
 
Q: Okay.  Just obviously deprivation -- no food --      
 
A: Just mental.      
 

Q: -- and seeing the violence, the hardship
. Mr. Gelfer, you mention th at there was 100 
survivors from Theresienstadt.  Is that -- 
how did you know th at
?  100 su rvivors of 
children, I guess.      
 
A: It's a fig u re that's ju st been released 
into books.  I have the book, "I Never Saw 
Another Butterfly," which I bought in the 
museum here, because my husband bought it 
for me when we were here fo
r the opening. Which is a book
 of paintings and poems by 
children who didn't survive.  
An d the preface mentions also the figure.  But how accurate 
they are -- I know, but I always heard the same
 figure.  It's always been 15,000 and 100 
survived.  15,000 that went 
thro ugh th e camp at one time fro
m th e beginning to the end -- 
not that they were all there at the same time --
 that went through. And mo st of them went 
to Auschwitz.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  At some point.      
 
A: So I guess records were kept
, because it's  always been 
the same record -- the same 
figures.
 
Q: Now, you say that people knew about the 
gas chambers -- about the gassing.      
 
A: That I heard from my moth
er the night before. And it 
was -- she says it was just 
hysteria.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.      
 
A: And disbelief that they we
re there so long they weren't 
going to make it.  And, from 
what I heard is that the Ameri
can Red Cross got word  that th
is was going to  be the end of 
the camp and th ey were going to destroy th is
 whole camp with ev erybody in  it.  They  
didn't  want -- they knew, I guess,
 that it was all coming to an en
d in '45.  And they didn't  
want any visible signs of this camp.  Theres
ienstadt was a fortress at one time.  Just 
outside of Prague, a small town in the countr
yside of Prague, and was used as an army  
fortress.  A nd they were just going to get rid 
of it all totally so there was no signs of it.  
So when this war is over and whoever -- 
Americans -- whoever came over, there would 
be nothing left to say, "Yes, 
there was something there at one
 time."  And they had to do 
this kind of quickly  where it was this was going 
to  be over pretty soon.  And so, they had 
to act very quick ly.  And so mehow the Red 
Cross got wind of th
is, and the Russians 
came in.      
 
Q: Before that.  Do you have any idea of wh
y you were sent there to Theresienstadt?  
Why you and your mother were sent there?      
 
A: My mother, as I said be
fo re, was born of a -- born Prot
estant mo ther and a Jewish 
father.  My grandmother converted  wh en she 
married my grandfather.  I think they were 
treading very easy at that time. 
 They didn't  want to an tago
nize the Christians by having 

too many Christians killed.  So my grandm
other would say because of her age and she 
wasn't important as an old wo man, 70-year-old
 wo man, she wasn't going to do th at mu ch 
harm.  My mother, they weren't quite sure 
yet where she fit in.  She was not born of a 
Jewish mother, which makes a difference.  Like I said before, they
 measured her -- the 
nose, the head and neck .  And they  really -- 
it took th em a while to say, "Well, we're 
going to put you in a holding camp until we 
can figure out what we
're going to do with 
these mischling -- people who we
re of half breeds or not qu
ite totally Jewish."  There 
were a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war hero
s, like Simon, whom they didn't w ant to kill 
off either.  We don't w ant a big war hero
 from World War I, who got the congressional 
medal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- 
a lot of writers out there, musicians.      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: People that they were just
 going to hold for a while and 
then see what happens type of 
thing.  They didn't want to leave them free, but
 they didn't want to 
send them to the death 
camps right away.  And also people like my  mo
ther that they couldn't decide quite how 
Jewish she was at that time.  I was lucky, 
because I was totally Jewish because -- well, 
almost totally Jewish, because I 
have a Jewish father.      
 
Q: Mm-hmm.  But so it wasn 't because of the fa
ct that sh e was an actress, I guess.
