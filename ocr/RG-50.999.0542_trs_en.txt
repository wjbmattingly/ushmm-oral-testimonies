Here we see Susanand hermother,Bertha Strauss, together in af ield near their hom e in 
Vacha. 
 
 
In Novem ber 1938, the Nazis unleashed a wave of pogrom s throughout Germany, known as of  
Kristallnacht, or the Night of  BrokenGlass.This photograph shows Germans passing thebroken

Eventually, Susan and her mother were sent to the Kaiswerwald concentration cam p, which 
thef irstarrow points to. Therethey were forced to dof orced labor. In thef allof  1944, as the Soviet 
Arm y approached, Susan andherfam ily were  deported tothe Stutthof  concentration cam p to which

>> Susan T aube: No, 90. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  90. 
 
[Laughter]
 
Susan, thank youfor joining us, and your willi ngness to be our 
F i rst P e rs o n
. Inour short period of 
tim e, youhave som uch totell us.W e'll start.You were just 7 and living in the sm all town of Vacha in 

Germ any when Hitler cam e to power in 1933.Af ter that, your lif e and that of  yourfam ily changed 
dramatically. Let's begin f irst with you telling us a littleabout your family and what it was like in the 
years leading upto Kristallnacht
. 
 
>> SusanT aube:W ell, I was 7 years old when Hitler cam e to power. I was until this time life was 

normalf or us, very norm al.W ehad a store.My m other. I had a sister. My mother'sm other used to 
live with us. Lif e wenton very norm al, until Hitler came
 
to power. 
 
 
Right awa y, as soon as he came, there werepeople inunif orm s, standing inf ront of the store, 
wouldn't let custom ers into theplaceto buy. Comm erce com pletely died down in the store.Som y 
father took to going to the neighborhood, because it
 
was mostly f arm country around the little town. 
He was like a peddler, selling and delivering. T his wentonfor quitea while, until it came atim e that 

even this wasn't possible anym ore, becausepeople didn't want to be seen, to be known that they buy 
fr
om  Jews anym ore. 
 
 
Anyhow, the businesswas closed. My m other, in them eantim e, came Kristallnacht andm y 
father was arrested,and he was sent to a concentration cam p, Buchenwald.

>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout whathappenedaf terKristallnacht, letme ask youa couple 
of  other questions, if Ican. 
 
>> SusanT aube: About Kristallnacht? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  About events leading up to that.W hen vandalism  began happening toproperty, at 
f irst the insurance, you toldm ethe insurancewould pay f or it,
 
but after a while that stopped. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah, we had topay our own dam ages.Kristallnachthappened. In1938, suddenly 

people who were notGerm an citizens, were in Germany, cam ef rom  Poland, Romania, whatever, 
they're pickedupat night and without any wa rning, without anything, put on trainsand dumpedonthe 
border of  Poland. 
 
 
A young m an, who was among them, he was studying in Paris.W hen hef ound out what 
happened to hisparents, he got very upset about it, and wanted to bring the attentionof  what 

happened to the world. Foolishly, he tooka gun,entered theGerman Embassy in Paris and shot the 
secretary there. 
 
 
So after 24 hours, then the secretary died, and during the tim e the government organized 
Buchenwald, what was later called Kristallnacht. People at that tim e, I couldn't go to schoolin m y 
hometown anym ore. Five Jewish children, we  had to leave the school system . I was with m y sister, 
oneof  them  at that time. 
 
 
T hey cam e tothe apartm ent without ringing the doorbell or anything, just knocked down the 
door, came in, and dem olished the whole apartm ent.There wasn'ta cup lef t, aplate lef tto eat or 
drinkf rom, nothing. Most of  them enf rom age 16 to 65 were taken to concentration cam ps.Am ong 
th em  wa s m y fa the r. 
 

 
 
6
 
 
My f ather was let goafterf our weeksbecause he was a veteranof W orldW ar I, was f ighting in 
the German Arm y, so they let him go. Hehad to leave the country. They told him  he hadtoleave, 
cannot stay in the country. He hadto leave the country. Sohepacked a little suitcas
e and he went 
to
 
--
 
hepicked up what they called, what dothey call som ebody totake you over theborder? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  A sm uggler? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Over the border toBelgium . My m other was lef t inthe little town Vacha.Lif e was 

m iserable f or her, t
hatshe thought or was forced to sell the store and the house, but never received 
any m oney for it. After Kristallnacht, all of ourassets were conf iscated and whatever was available, 

for savings or whateve r, we had no control over it anym ore. 
 
 
W e  r e ce i ve
d each month a certain am ount to live f rom and pay our bills or whatever it was, 
andthat was it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, while you were going through that, yourf ather had escaped the country. 

W ere youable, was yo ur m otherabletobe in touch with him d
uring that tim e? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yes,yes. After a while we found out thathem ade it saf ely to Belgium . He had just 
what he was wearing, nothing else at all. Buthe was there. 
 
 
Going backa littlebit,we did try to im m igrate to Am ericaat that time. It
 
was very diff icult.You 
hadtohave som ebody to sponsor you, so you wouldn'tfall onthe governm ent. Evenaf teryou found 
som ebody, andthe paym ent cam e, we went to the em bassy, oncethe papers got there, you received 
a num ber, and youhad to waitf or your number to come up. 
 
 
W ehad adistant relative finally who was wil li ng to work f orm y father. You comef irst, you 
establish yourself. Once you have a jobor whatever, they will help you to bring the restof  thefam ily.

W ell,  in t h e me a nt im ewa s  K ris t a lln
acht. Hewent to Belgium. T he papers,he was called to the 
consulate inBerlin.Becausehe was in Belgium , thepapers had to be transferred to Belgium ,and 
that wholeprocesstook about six m onthsbefore he actually could leave Europe. 
 
 
He lef t Europe justbefore the Germ an Arm y went into Holland,Belgium , invaded there. So he 
just made it out. He made it out in February, they invaded in May, I think. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasstruck by oneof  thethings you shared, that whenhe was in Belgium, your 

m other would sendhim  things becausehehad nom oney. You sent him  shoes
 
--
  
>> SusanT aube: Oneat a tim e. You couldn'tsenda pair of  shoes, because they would be taken 

away f rom  you. If yousent a shirt, youhad to rem ove the sleeves. If you putthe whole shirt
,  h e 
wouldn't get it. A pair of pants, youhad to cutoff  one leg. I also had to be
 
--
 
that'show we li ved. 
 
 
T he Jewish community in Belgium took careof the ref ugees. He was not the only one who was 
in this situation.T here were quite af ew, and the Jewish com munity in Belgium took really care of  

th em . 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your father gone, it's you, your mother, sister,otherfamily m em bers.Your 

m other m oved you to Berlin. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Shewas f orced.W e were the last Jewish fam ily in that little town, and she was 
forced to selland move. W em oved to Berlin. The reason was because we thought sincewe wanted 
to imm igrate to Am erica and the sectionof Germ any that thepeople who to belong tothe
 
--
 
had to 
com e tothe consulatein Berlin. I was kicked
 
outof  school when I was 10 years old. Yeah.My 
parents sentm e to Frankfurt am  Maim ,toa Jewish school. I lived there with com plete strangers. I 

 
 
8
 
didn'thave moneyf orprivate school,food, lodging. T hey had to pay for that.Eventually m y sister 
joined m
e t he r e .  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappenedonce you were in Berlin? 
 
>> SusanT aube:W ell, we received
 
--
 
all these little towns
 
--
 
we hadto leave the little towns. Just 
couldn't stay anym ore. In Berlin, whoever had anapartm ent, Jewish people who had a bigger 

apartm ent hadto share, share their apartments with thepeoplef rom  other towns. And we were 
assigned an apartm ent. Owner of  thisapartment was am an, he was a reporter or whatever in the 
Germ an newspaper,but that also stopped. All off icial em ploym ent,post off ice,banks, anything off icial 
af ter 1938 all Jewish people were dism issedfrom  their jobs. All of them . 
 
 
So we m oved in with him . Onebedroom , comm unal living room , bathroom , kitchen. My 
grandm other, who was with us, shehad a cotin the bathroom  whereshe slept. My m other,m y sister, 
m yself , we slept inone bedroom . 
 
 
In Berlin, atthat time I was 14 years old, I was no longer in school.All the Jewish schoolswere 
closedalready. My f irst job was to take care of  children in a children's home, like dare carecenter, 
where the people, theparents dropped them off , like6:00 inthe morning, and picked them up 8:00, 
9:00 in theevening.W e had to be there 5:00in the morning toaccept the children, take care of  the 
children allday long, six days a week, 6
 
1/2 days a week, becausepeople had to work half
-
days on 
Sundays also.T hat was our job.W ithout pay. 
 

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas what I wantedto make sure you said. 
 
>> Susan T aube:W ithout pay. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Forced labor. 
 

 
 
9
 
>> SusanT aube: Yes.T he Jewish community, we had to do this. 
 
 
T hen came October, and very slo wl y
 
--
 
n o , it wa s n o t Octob e r. Ye ah, it wa s Octobe r. It wa s 
they tookm e outf rom  there,m e andm y gir lf riend, we hadto work in anold
-
age home.T he old
-
age 
home was the relatives all had to work. T he people were taken careof  in that old
-
age hom e. That 
was our
 
job there. 
 
 
Slowl y, slo wl y these people disappeared.Assoonas they got sick, they were taken outand 
they never saw them again. I think it was wor st in the old
-
age hom ethan the children's hom e, yeah. 
OK.W hat happened next? 
 
 
By the time I was 15
 
1/2,
 
I was growin g up enough, old enough,they putm e out of this kind of  
job, andI had to work for them ilitary industry.W hat did Ido?W hat was my job?W e wereassigned to 

af actory where they made receivers f or Uboats and we stayed on the assembly line. Jewi sh people 
andGermanpeople were separated inthe workplacealso.W enever sat together with anybody. 
 
 
In them eantim e, we also received the yellow star we had to wear.The German people 
received lunches andbreakf ast.W ehad topay our own. Everythin
g was rationed already, because 

the war was going on, so everything was rationed. Jewish people had to go to thepolice stationto 
pick uptheir own cards, what dothey call it? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourwork cards? 
 

>> SusanT aube: Card forf ood. Coupons. Coupons.W hen you went to the store,they knew you 
were a Jew, and you got only part of  what regular people received.W ereceived half of  what the 
Germ an population got. 
 

 
 
10
 
 
T he shop, we could only go between 4:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon. During this time there was 
hardly anything left in the stores, becausepeople shopped all day long. W hatever was lef t,we had to 
take. Youf ind som e good people andm en who owned the grocery store knew the situationwhat was 
happening,and he always kept som ethingf or m y m other when shecam e in. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, toldm e when you weref orced tom ake the submarine receivers, yo u were 

told if one didn't work that would be considered an act of sabotage. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yes,sabotage. And you would end up ina concentration camp. Yes. You couldbe 

seenas sabotaging it. I don't think so. I wouldn't, anyway. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, eventually, you would be with your f am ily, you would be deported to Riga, 

Latvia. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah.To have a job like this, I think it was in the late November.I don't rem ember 

anym ore. How did wefind out?The gentleman we lived with, he had a daughter who had just gotten 
m arried. Not a young wom an anym ore. She lived about half an hour away f romhim. He tried to call 
her, there was no
 
answer. 
 
 
He tried af ew days, he couldn't think what was happening. Eventually, he received apostcard 
f rom  Poland,f rom Lodz, Poland: Dearf ather, due to circum stancesbeyond our control, we were 
resettled here to this place. So the German citizens who li ve in Poland are being resettledto the 
Germ an side.W earehere, we aref ine. Youwi ll hearf rom usagain. That was the only postcard, 
whatever he gotf rom  her. Never heardanything again. 
 
 
Af ter this it startedto get very organi zed. People received noticesby m ail. I'm  just telling you 
aboutm y gir lf riend, m y best girlf riend.W e were actually like sisters. Oneday they received a notice, 

 
 
11
 
the postcard, Mr.
 
AndMrs., dueto the samecircum stances you have tobe ready at this and this 
date. You will be resettled to the east.W hatever you want to take, you can take what you can carry. If  
you have bigger item sto take, youdrop them off  at a certainplace wi th your nam e on it, it will be sent 
to your new destination. 
 
 
W ell, whatever they carried they had and whatever was droppedoff they never saw again. 
 
 
She left.I wantedto say goodbye to her.I said, well, when our timecom es, mail to me soI 
know where you are. Ihope to see you again. Andthat's it. I never received a card. Inever heard 

f rom  her aga
i n , n ot h i ng.  
 
 
Our time cam e in the end of Decem ber, Ithink it was, yeah, m iddleDecember. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  1942, December 1941? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah.The sam em essage, be ready at this and this tim e. You can takewith you, 
etc.,etc.That was Friday evening. T hey came, two gestapo people, and askedfor our bank books, 
jewelr y, what's still lef t. Also, jewelry was confiscatedduring Kristallnacht.W ehad to give ever ything 
up except our wedding rings. 
 
 
If you had anything left, jewelr y, whatever, bank books, cashm oney, you can take with you 
100m arks. That's all you're allowed,because your m oney will be exchangedat your new destination, 

they toldus. Everything they took away, they signed the papers thatthey received it, and they lef t. 
T hey lef t usenough money to takepublic transportationto go to the place where we assem bled. 
 
 
T he place where we assem bled was a synagogue that was not burned down during 
Kristallnachtbecause it was standing between two private houses,big houses.T his was the 

 
 
12
 
concentration pointforall thepeople.Eventually, 5,000 people were in that place.That's it.W e 
waited. 
 
 
Next, we didn't know anything where we were  going. Next m orning,Saturday morning, there 
were only benches, no beds, nothing to sleep on.Only benches.W ater was supplied, but nof ood. 
Nothing atall.T hey called us, table set up, the gestapo sitting there. They called people down and 
they said, well, you still have papers left? Doyou have any passbooks lef t? At that time we didn't 
have passports. T
hey were taken away. Ideally, we had the card with the J stamp on it.This we still 
had. You can leave ithere. You geta new ID at your new destination. 
 
 
W hat is your new destination?W efoundoutwe wil l be resettledto the city of Riga, Latvia. OK. 
Rig
a, Latvia. It cam e Sunday m orning.W e had toassem ble inf rontof  the synagogue. Early, early 
m orning,bef ore anybody woke up, there were the trucks,and they transported thepeoplewho could 
not walk, they were taken.W ehad to walk aboutf ive kilometers to the train station called 
Kaiswer wald, a suburb of  Berlin. 
 
 
W ecame to the station, lookedfor a train to take us.W hat we saw was the cattle cars,that 
you see inthe museum . The cattle cars wer e opened up and inside were benches m adeoutof  straw. 
S tr
aw on thef loor. Oneach side of the walls was a bucketf or yourphysical needs. Afew bottles of  
wa te r. T ha t wa s it. 
 
 
Once it wasf illedup, the wagons were f illedup, I don't know how m any people they pushed in 
there, we laid like sardines on thef loor,
 
no room betweenus,nothing. You couldn't move.W hich was 
good, because it was very cold. There was no heat in thereeither. 
 

 
 
13
 
 
So thosedoors were closed, and off we went to Riga, Latvia. Probably took threedays, three 
nights. Very cold.W inter. It was 1942. January 1942, very cold. As Isaid, no heat, nothing.Anyhow, 
we arri ved in Riga. T he doors were opened.T here was the SS. " Out! Out! Out!"
 
Dogs, barking. " Out! Ever ybody out!"
 
we could hardly m ove,we were all so stiff f rom  the travel. But we moved.
 
W e walked about 10 
kilom eters to your destination. You can go inthe trucksand we takeyou there. 
 
 
W ell, thepeople whowere in the trucks, mostly children, elderly people, we never saw them  
again. My m other,m y sister, evenm y grandm other, we walked.W e walked the 10 kilometers, on icy 

roads, slow, ice, cold,ver y, very cold. Holding ontoeach other, justnot to fall. Terrible. 
 
 
W ecome to the ghetto. Houses surrounded by wi re. Doublef ences.Double wire fences. Abig 
gate with sentries there on both sides with the guns.W e were pushed inthere, andpushed toa 
certain house.T hey pushed us to ahouse with no light, no heat,nothing. It was already dark by that 
tim e.W edidn't even know where we are. 
 
 
So in themorning we woke up, we looked around and there was clothes all over the place and 
food on the stove andfood onthe tables andclothesall thrown around,blood in the snow. W edidn't 
know at that tim e what happened,but soon enough we found out that that was thepopulation of the 
Jewish people of
 
Riga, Latvia, and they were all concentrated in that placebefore we came, and in 
late December they we re m ost of them murdered. 
 
 
T hey kept behind 500wom en and4,000m en for labor.T he rest were all elim inated.All in 
m ass graves in Riga, Latvia. T his wef ound out later. 
 

 
 
14
 
 
Anyhow, into the house we went. Just looking around, af ter two days they came to us. Hewas 
assignedf rom  theheadquarters of the gestapo thatthey have to provide peoplefor cleaning up the 
streetsf rom  snow andice, and they should bring the peoplef rom  the ghettotodo this kindof  work. 
 
 
So onem an was in charge to organize that.He came to eachapartm ent or room, whatever it 
was. In each apartment there were about 10people. Just like sardines.T hey said youhave to goto 

wo rk. If
 
you want to eat, you have to go to work. 
 
 
W e were assem bled in the front of the house in the morning.W e received a piece of bread, 
andthey took usall to the gate of the ghettoandthey marched usunder the gun tothe city of  Riga, to 
certain places where we received shovels and ice picks and instruments to clean up the ice. That's 
what we did. It was a very cold winter. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was to clear the ice so that theGermans could walk on the sidewalks? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yes. T he population. Not
 
only the Germans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you were not allowed towalk? 
 
>> SusanT aube:W ewere not allowed to walk on the sidewalks.W e had to walk on the streets. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you don'tm ind, when If irst m et you 16 years ago, you told meaboutthis, you 

described that scene when youenteredthe ghetto.T hat inm y m indI still can'talmost imagine it, 
where ever ything was covered in ice. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Everything. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  You were f orced into the room , thetables were coated in ice. T here was lef tover 
food.T here was clothing, all under sheetsof ice. 
 

 
 
15
 
>> SusanT aube: Sheets of ice, yeah.T his didn't changeuntil lateMarch or beginning April. It was a 
ver y, very cold winter. Really cold. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would stay in the Riga ghetto about 20 months, and were forced to dom any 
different kinds of things. 
 
>> SusanT aube:W ell, afterthis jobf inished,the ice was gone, the snow was gone, m y next job was 
workin g f or theLuf twaffe, Air Force, which wa sn't sobad actually.W e had to clean the offices where 
they're livin g. T hey confiscated the mostbeautiful houses in Riga.W e were pickedup in the morning 
by the soldier, always under the gun,m arched tothe place of work, then we hadto work all day to 
clean thehouses,do the laundry, whatever had to be done, help in the kitchen sometimes,which was 
good. At least we get som ef ood there.T hatwas good. Becausethe ghetto supplied very, ver y little 
food. Very little.W e received some bread.W e som etim es would receive a little bitof  vege
tables. And 
horsem eat. Horse meat we got. But there was noplaceto cook it, because we hadnofacilities to 
cook anything.

walking in the street, we saw a piece of  
wood, we picked it upand took it home to cook on this little stove. 
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
One of the things you shared with m e, Susan, despite all thatawf ulness, the Jews in 
the ghettotried tom ake life as norm al as you could. You evennam ed your streets in there. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah.We organized a school.T here were still children there that were saved.W e 

organized a school.W e even had councils. Yes, we had, thanksto the Latvian Jews, we had 

 
 
16
 
instruments, we had concertseven. One time even the comm andant of the ghetto,a highoff icer of 
the gestapo, cam eto listen to it. 
 
 
T his was alsothe exceptions. Exception tothe rule,believe me. Even one day what happened 
in the ghetto, well, the Latvian Jews were m ostly young people lef t behind. T hey grew up in f reedom. 
T hey didn't realize what the Nazis can do.T hey organized a resistance in the ghetto. But it was 
discovered, and whoever was participating in it was killed. They called them one day, and we have an 
organization, we have to discuss things, the comm andantf rom theorganization called them  together 
andthen the gestapo cam e in,and marched them tothe place and shot them alldown. That was it. 
So thattook careof  the resistance. 
 
 
Af ter this the ghetto was liquidatedbecause itcan happenagain andthe ghetto was liquidated. 
Also the Russians came closer.W e were selected.Selections wereall thetime.T here were old 
people, sick people, we had a hospital there,butnom edication.Whatever little medicationwas, there 
were very sick people, and after two days if  you didn't getout of thehospital you disappeared. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atone point you saidthey, to get rid of theelderly people they would say, W e're 

going to send you toaf ishf actory where you can work, where you'r e inside, it's warm er, you will have 
better f ood. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah, that was af ter we we re three months in theghetto. At that time, a lot of 
elderly people were still there,they couldn't go to work in the city. Each house had somebody what 
you called the caretaker. He knew the people who lived there.Thegestapo came to the caretaker, 
said how m any peopleyou have of a certain age? He had to tell them . Oneday they cam e, they said, 
listen, you're not useful here, we will send you to afishfactory where you can work in a fishfactory, 

 
 
17
 
you can clean thef ish and can, whatever you have todo. You will be taken care of there.People 
were happy to go,butthey never went to thefishf actory. T his he went to th
e  cem e te ry. T ha t's it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1943, when they liquidated the ghetto, you were sent to several concentration 

cam ps, Kaiswer wald, thentoa place calledMitiom .T ell us aboutMitior. 
 
>> SusanT aube: After the Russianf ront came closer, the concentration camp was liquidated. I went 
to Kaiswerwald two we eks. I was one of the luckier ones.T hey cam e, when we stood
 
--
 
e ve r y 
m orning, you got to get up5:00 in them orning, stand outside the barracks and be counted.Counted 

for 2,3 hours som etimes. You hadto stay there. Rain, sunshine, whatever it was. Oneday when I 
was am ong the lucky ones that came, they counted up 200 women and we were put on trucks.W e 
didn't know where we were going. It wasn't 200. No, not thatm any. Maybe 100. 
 
 
W e were taken to a place called Mitior, which was a Jewish old factory that they used to make 
tires for cars,boots, everything m adef rom rubber.That was thefactory. And we were taken tothat 
fa cto ry. 
 
 
T hisfactory, the Germans tookover. T hey brought in
 
--
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Pontoon boats. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Right, to get the cars ortrucks over. T hey were dam aged, shotup,theycam e tothe 

factory and we had to repair them . 
 
 
T hey cam e tothisfactory. Inside were m ostly f rogs, snakes, whatever. That was the job ofthe
 
few m en who worked there. They had to clean it out.Then we cam e into thefactory.W e had big, big 
long tables, they put them  on thetables, andwe had to glue them together. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It washorrible work, because you're dealing with toxic glues.
  

 
 
18
 
>> SusanT aube:T oxic glue. A lot of peoplestartedto cough and got sick. But we were already told 
to do this, and it was im portant work f or them  at thistim e. So they got us, they supplied us a cup of 
m ilk each day to counteract the poison in ourlungs. ButI was lucky again. After the boatswere all 
f ixed up, ready to be put in action, they hadto be painted and water proofedagain. So that was m y 
next job.W e were assigned to do that. 
 
 
T hat was in a room , nice room,back room wi th windows.W hat's good about it was that the 
off icer, theoverseer of theoperation, the off ice was in that place. Itwas closed in with glass, but the 
door was open.Therewas a radio, andtherewere newspapers, and we knew, we found out what's 
going on actually. T hisgave us
 
a little hope to go f rom day today. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You knew the Germ ans lostat Stalingrad. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Stalingrad was lost and there always was a successful retreat, always successf ul. 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Successful retreat. 
 
>> Susan T
aube: Successf ul retreat, yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T henby
 
--
  
>> SusanT aube: But the successf ul retreatdidn't gof ast enough. 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the late summ er of 1944, you were sent to yetanother concentration cam p, 

S tu tth of. 
 

 
 
19
 
>> Susan T a
ube:T hat's the last of the advance. Cam e summ er, of 1944, andthe ghetto was 
liquidated.W e were all put ona boat, about 3,000, 4,000 people on the boat. Standing room  only. No 
oneoutside on thedeck, everything underneath. Andputto sea. 
 
 
W e arrived 
at Stutthof concentration exterm ination camp. It was August 1944.W e were 
unloaded, put on the
 
--
 
there was ametal there.W e waitedon themetal.T here was a littleri ver there. 
Eventually there came barges, coalbarges, then inthese coal barges we were forcedto go sit, we 

couldn't standup.Eventually we arri ved at the concentration camp,Stutthof.W hen we disem barked, 
we were all black. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Covered in coal? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Covered with black.Because they were coal barges.T hey transferred coal in there. 
 
 
W ell, Stutthof .W e came to Stutthof. Beautif ulf lowers in the entrance. Beautif ul. Youm archin, 
about 100 yards, you see thedogs, the gravel, you seepeople walking around.W ehad already got 
thatbefore Kaiswer wal d. T he people moving
 
around and looking down, nobody lookedup. Everybody 
looked down.T hey pushedus inthe bog.T he bog hadbridges. Just bridges. On each bridge, like 

sardines,one this way, one this way, one thiswa y. No blankets, juststraw. T hat's it. 
 
 
In the m orning, 
5:00, the bell rang. You gotout of the barracks, youhadto stand and be 
counted, counted. Sick people were takenout who couldn't stand straight anymore.T hey were taken 
to the gas chamber.And the rest, we just wait aroundfor the wholeday. Cam e noonti
m e, again stand 
up andbe counted again. Again selection. Allday long. 
 

 
 
20
 
 
About 8:00atnight,f inally we could go into the barracks. That was it. Since we couldn't sleep 
in the barracksand couldn'tf inda place there, there weref ive girls,  at thattim e 
we  kin d  of  st u ck 
together, we laidoutside inthe sand.T hat was it.W edidn'teven go into the barracks. 
 
 
In them eantim e,naturally, no showers, nobaths, no change of clothes.We weref ull of lice. 
T hat wasn't a goodthing either,becausea lot of people got infections and started scratching and it 
was not good. 
 
 
T hat was ourentertainment also.W e tookoff the clothes and we tried to kill as muchas we 
could. Five girls, we were lucky. Af ter two weeks concentration camp in Stutthof , again,they cam e, 
they counted 500 women at that tim e, justm arched inf ront of the ghetto. We didn't know maybe 
going to the gas chamber, we didn't know wh ere we're going. 
 
 
Out of the ghetto.Took us to a train station. Regular train thistime. W e went in the train. About
 
two, three hours laterwe cam e to aplace called Sophia
 
--
 
I f orgot already. 
 
[Laughter]
 
Good f or you. 
 

[Laughter]
 
Sounds good. Out of the train we m archedabout two, three kilometers, not too f ar.W e arrived at a 

cam p surrounded by wire. Sentries all over. Barracks m adeout of plywood. Littlebarracksm ade out 
of  plywood. Each barrack 15 wom en. Only wo m en atthat tim e.15 wom en ineach barrack,covered 
only with straw, nothing else. One little window in the barrack. That's it. Straw. 
 
 
Andonce we were in
 
there, we had to assemble outside, the commandanttalked tous: You 
are here not to party, but to work. Your work wi ll be tobuild roads and housingf orthe m ilitary. If  you 

 
 
21
 
behave yourself ,that's what you actually said, If  you will behave yourself, will
 
you be treated all right. 
So do your job. Do thebest you can.And that's it. 
 
 
OK. So the next day we received oneblanket at thattim e.T he next day we f oundout, they 
divided us indiff erentworkplaces to go to, we were about, I don't know, about 50, 60 girls and one 
comm ander,and we wentand we had to digout roots.They were building a road and they tookdown 
the trees,and we hadto pick out the rootsf rom  the trees,putthem on the Lori, push the lorr y to a 
certain place.Then the lorry back, f ill itupagain, the roots, whatever it was. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T opick out the roots, you were digging out the roots of  trees. Extremely hard work. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah, it was, with picks and shovels. Sometimeswe used ourhands when we 
didn't have anything.
 
So that was our jobf or the whole day.W hat was the privilege we had there? 
T here was also them ilitary, them ilitary and supply for them ilitary went by us. Not toofar awa y. 
 

 
As young people, we went down to the wagons and we got som efoodf rom there. 
C a rro t s , 
potatoes, whatever it was we could eat. Thenthem ilitary didn't bother us. It was really som ething 

else. So at least we had som e supplementorfood in them orning,before we went to work, which I 
received a piece of bread, that was it, nothing else.W aterf or coff ee. And when we cam e back, a 
bowl of  soup, piece of bread, that was our nourishm ent. 
 
 
Again, a lot of people got sickf rom  starvationanddied. All right, this lasteduntil it got cold, 
then we couldn't do the jobanym orebecause it was too cold to digandtoo coldto lay bricks for the 
houses. So they tookus out f rom thesebarracks, these littletiny barracks, and they putusin the 
unf inishedbuildings.They weren't f inished yet, but the basem ents were there,and residedin these 
basem
ents. Nof loors.Just sand. Nof loors. But it was warm er. It was warm . It wasn't that cold. 
 

 
 
22
 
 
W edidn't work anym ore.W e just sataround talking. Just gota littlepiece of  bread, a littlebit of  
food, notm uchf or the day. T hat was it. 
 
 
T hen came February. T he Russian Arm y cam e closer. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  February 1945. 
 
>> SusanT aube:W edidn't know what's going on atthat time intheworld.We had no idea. Because 
them ilitary, they didn't talk tous. Butthe Russian Arm y cam e closer, and oneday they sa
id ,  W ell,  
you know, we cannot stay here.T hat's whenwe f oundout the Russians are very close.W e have to 
take youaway f rom  here.W e are going backto Stutthof . If  you canwalk, you have to walk. It will be 
about 100 kilom eters. You can walk. If  you cannot walk, stay here,som ebody will take care of  you. 
 
 
W ell, wef ive girls, we talked.People walked,butpeople were really ready to give up.T hey 
said no, we'll take our chance, we'll stay here.W hatever happens will happen.W enever saw them  
again. 
 
 
So  w
e walked. Rain, snow, cold, icy roads, we walked. Atnight, when it gotdark, they pushed 
us in thebog. If  wef ound som ething to eat, we received som ething.Otherwise, we had nothing. 
Sometimes wef oundalong the way a potato,whatever.W hatever was edibl
e , we  a te.W ea te  it.W e 
didn't know if  it was good ornot. Naturally, people got sick. 
 
 
Af ter 10 days we cam e to a cam p called Gudendorf barracks. Full of people alreadyf rom all 
theother cam ps,because the Russians were really closing in. 
 

>>
 
Bill Benson: T his we now call the death marches. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah. And that was the deathm arch. It was adeathm arch, yeah.At Gudendorf  we 

heardalready shooting in the distance. Big bom bs, cannonf ire.W edidn't know what's happening. 
 

 
 
23
 
 
T hey cam e
 
tous again, said, You cannot stay here.The Russiansare right around.W e have 
to leave.W e cannot stay here. Idon't know why they didn't elim inate us right there and then. Ihave 
no idea. Maybethey didn't have enough guns or whatever. 
 
 
But we marched
 
a whole night again.A whole night. Icy cold, cold, very cold. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthe coldest winters ever, that winter of 1944
-
45. 
 
>> SusanT aube: 45 already, ver y cold.W e marchedthe whole night. In themorning again,they 
pushed us in thebarn,
 
full of people already. Old people, whatever was there, it wasf ull.W ejust sat 
down. That's it. Idon't know what's going on. W ehad no idea whatwould happen. 
 
 
Any Howe how, m orning, big, big, big
 
--
 
anyhow, m orning, big, big, big boom s.W eheard they
 
shoot down the bomb.But it just sohappened it was the Russian Arm y that opened the doorsf or us 

andthat was theend ofour, what should I call it? Misery. Maybe. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasn't the end. 
 
>> SusanT aube: It wasn't the endof m isery. At least we were not under the gun anym ore. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Notunder the Nazis anym ore. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Right.W e went out.Therewas a Germ an town and the German population was 
ready to leave.Because of the Russian Arm y com ing in.They all had their horses,
 
whatever, wagons, 
food, clothes,everything. So that's where we got our ownf ood,f ood. Thef irstthing Iate was bacon. 

And sauerkraut. Sauerkraut.T hat's what Ifound. I didn't die thenand there, why, I don't know. I still 
like m y sauerkraut. 
 
[Laughte
r]
 
Yeah. 
 

 
 
24
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your liberation day was Marc h 10. 
 
>> SusanT aube: March 10, 1945. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just over 71 years ago, a couple weeks ago. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah, yeah.I celebratedmy second birthday. My second birthday. I will be 70. But 
reality is 90. But the war was still going on. W here do you go? Noplace to go. T he Russians were 
com ing, they said hey, you can work for the Germ ans or you can work for us. They took us in a 
wagon, ga ve us a wagon, and they took us to af arm .Big f arm  inPom erania. First, they cleaned us 
up.W e got rid of all the lice.T hey gave us a few days, then we hadto work f or them .W ecleaned up 
the f ields f rom  the debris.W e had to
 
--
 
f rom  debris. It took about 4 weeks and that was done. Then 
they tookus, the Russians, to the city of  Kaiswer wald, which was m ostly evacuatedf rom  the Germ an 

people, and we had toclean outthe houses,what wasn't naileddown on thef loor,onthewall or 
whatever. T hat was all shipped to Russia. Clothes,appliances, whatever could be 
shipped was 
shipped, taken toa warehouse and shipped to Russia. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, our tim e is growing s hort, and you know I'm going to ask you this.You have 

to tellus how you m etHerm an. 
 
>> SusanT aube:W ell, while we cleaned out the houses, the
re was also a big warehouse for 

m edication. And
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bayer Corporation. 
 
>> Susan T aube: Big warehouse for medication. We didn't cook for ourselves.W e were f ive girls, we 
hada nice apartment and everything, butdidn't get supplies to cook.W ehad a comm unal kitchen. 
W egotbreakfast, lunch and dinner. 
 

 
 
25
 
 
Oneday I walk into the kitchen, and them anager of the kitchen was a Jewish soldierf rom  
Ro m an ia .  He s a id
 
--
 
and he hada very sick girl at that tim e. My f uture husband was am edic in the 
Russian Arm y. He was a Polish Jew, but when the war broke out hewent over to Russia and joined 
the Russian Arm y. T he Polish division in theRussian Arm y. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Serving as a medic through that whole tim e? 
 
>> SusanT aube: He was am edic. He cam
e for the medication. The warehouse was right across 
f rom  the kitchen. He walked into that kitchen,andheasked them anager what's going on.He toldhim  
thatherearef ive girls, survi vors of  the concentration cam pand oneis very sick, m aybe hecould 
hav
e somem edication for her. 
 
 
He went to seeher. She had scarletf ever, actually.W hile he was there, I walked in too. I 
wanted to see how she was doing. And that'show we m et. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here's m ore tothe story. If  Irem em ber correctly, there's legitim ate concern about 

wom en being raped by the Russians, so with the sick wom an with you Herm an put up a sign saying 
" This place is quarantined becauseof  typhus."   
 
>> SusanT aube: So they didn'tbother her. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T henhe had to get youout 
of  t h e r e.  
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah.Well,f irst, it wasn't right away lo ve atf irst sight. It was kindof  whatever. 
 

[Laughter]
 
He came back againf or m edicationand we met again. Sothen we becamem ore
 
--
 
we becam e 
closer. And he said, You know, I'm  leaving this placehere.I'm  going to go to EastGermany, with m y 
unit to East Germ any. He asked if  I would like to com e with him .I said, Sure. W hynot?W hat do I 

 
 
26
 
have to lose? 
 
[Laughter]
 
B u t  he
 
--
 
that was against the law at thattim e. So whatdid he do? He put
 
me ina stretcher, covered 
m eup,took me to atank. There was a tank.T old the soldier, She'sver y, very sick. Don't you touch 
her. I have to take her to m y hospital. That's how
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  He had tobribea littlebit. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Hadto bribe with vodka. Few bottles of  vodka. Vodka paid everything. If you had it, 
yeah. That was lif euntil lif ebecame a little more normal. From  therewe went to Germany, but it was 
just shortly af terthe war.W heredo you go?My f ather was in Am erica. Ihad 
kept his address in m y 
head the whole tim e. 
 
 
I lookedfor m y m other. I couldn'tf indher. She was not here anym ore. My sister was lost. My 
m other lost. My grandm other was lost. And so we m oved, we wentback to Poland actually, because 
he hada good education. He was alm ost like a doctor,buthehad to get hisfull degreeactually. So 
he wanted to go backto the universit y. So I went with him toPoland, to theoccupied section of  
Germ any, what became Polandeventually. Pom eraniabecam e Poland.W e hada housethere. It was 
ver y nice. 
 
 
He studied andhepracticed also already, becausethere was no other doctor. He had the 
experiencef rom  the war, plenty of experience. But then cam e1946, and the Polish people didn't like 

when Jewish people cam e back.T here was a big pogrom , survivor s who cam e back occupiedone 
house and thePoles cam e in and kill them  all. 
 

 
 
27
 
 
Af ter thathappened, we saw nofuture in Poland. My husband really wanted to stay in Poland. 
T here was nofuturef or us in Poland. So at that time there was an undergroundf rom  Israel, at that 
tim ePalestine, who sm uggled survi vors to Palestine, and we were am ong them. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did you f ind yourfather? 
 

>> SusanT aube: Ifoundm y f ather. Let me think am inutenow. Yeah, we were back inGerm any
. 
Yeah,f rom  Poland I couldn't send him anything. T hen we were backin Germany, in Berlin,when we 

were sm uggled out.Iwrote a letter. Hisaddress I had in m y head. I m et a soldier, I had the letter 
prepared, andIm etasoldier on the train station. 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  A USsoldier. 
 
>> SusanT aube: Am erican soldier. I asked him  to pleasem ail that letterfor me. Heput a stamp on it 
andm ailed it. He said sure. But theaddress I had inm y head. Hedidn't live there anym ore. Sothe 
people at that tim edidn't know what was going on I guess yet, andthey didn't forward the letter to 
him . He hadm oved two blocksaway f rom them . 
 
 
So Ididn't hearf rom  him .Thenagain, it wasstill, af ter the war, things were notnormal yet, so I 
didn'tpay m uch attention to it.
 
I wrote another letter about two months later. Again, mailed it to him  
directly. T he post off ice received the letter, by that time they knew was was going on andforwarded 

the letter tom y f ather. T hat's how I foundm y father. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you reunite with him ? 
 
>> SusanT aube:W e reunited with him in 1947. My son was already born here, yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, m y last question of you, when did you learnwhat happened to your m other 

and your sister? 
 

 
 
28
 
>>
 
SusanT aube:W ewere separated in Riga. You know, you were  nota name, you werea num ber. 
W hen we stayed oneday to be assigned work, m y m otherand sisterwere sent toone place, I was 
sent to another place.That's how we were separated.ButI knew where they were, she knew where I 
was.W e knew. For awhile, we kind of  comm unicated through people. 
 
 
But then she worked what was called, it was they m ade receiverf or the Army, everything was 
Arm y oriented. T hat whole unit, the whole
 
--
 
I don't know how m any people were this thatplace, but 
they were evacuateddirectly, individually to openupafactory to start working again. 
 

 
My m other, If oundout laterf rom  somebody who survi ved, I don't know what it was, but she 
was 46 years old, so couldn't be too bad. My sister again also thesepeoplef rom  that placewere on 

thedeathm arch backto Stutthof ,and m y sister did not survi ve the death march. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  She lived all the way up tothe death march? 
 
>> SusanT aube: Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'regoing to wrap up our program  now.W edon't
 
--
