[Applaus e]
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Hello. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Good morning, J acqueline.  Thank  you s o muc h for  being
 
willing to be our  F
irst 
P

and s pend this  next hour with us .  You have s o muc h to s har e with us  s o we'll s tar t.
 
 
Let's s tart, though, with you telling us a little bit about your  fam ily and your own early year s , 
even though you wer e ver y, very young, befor e Hitler  annexed Aus tr ia and Czec hos lovakia in 1938.  

Tell us what you c an about your fam ily pr ior to that time.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  When I was  3 year s  old, that was  the las t tim e that I s aw m y two 
grandm others, one in Ham burg, Germ any, and then we went dir ec tly to the Hague to s ee my Dutch 
family.  I c an't s ay that I have any m em or y.  I know that wherever ther e was  a thr eat in Par is , that my 
par ents left with us , with m y sis ter and m e.  We went away bec aus e s he didn't know what was  going to 
happen.  That's  all
 
--
 
I r eally don't know.

> > Bill Bens on: What were your  par ents' nationalities ?  We m entioned your  m other was  born in 
Germ any.  What was  your  par ents' nationalities ?
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  My par ents were Dutc h J ews .  My father was  Dutc h
 
--
 
well, his  family  
were Dutc h
, th
e Mendels  fam ily, for gener ations  and gener ations .  If anybody knows  Holland, his  town 
is  c alled [Inaudible]
.  To
 
the end of his life, he r emained a Dutc h c itizen, never  bec am e Fr enc h.  And my 
m other  that he met in Ham burg bec aus e he was  in training, in a bank or  something
 a
ls o lived in 
Ham burg, Germ any, for generations  and generations .
  
I was  bor n in Paris .  My s is ter  and I wer e the 
fir s t ones to
 
be bor n in Paris , Franc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And later  we'll hear  about c itizens hip matter ing a little bit.  A little bit later.
 
 
You have a large extended family.  Right?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How large was it?  Give us  a s ens e
 
of that.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Well, before World War II
 
--
 
I was  too young to r eally know too m any 
people.  I k now I had two c ous ins  in Holland.  I c an't r emember , r eally.  I know fr om r es ear c h done by 

m y niec e that 200 member s  of our  extended family were m urder ed
f
r om Holland to Aus c hwitz and other 
c am ps.  I have in my book  a lis t of about 200.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  About 200 that you know of.
 
 
Your  father had a bus ines s .  What was  his  bus ines s?  And during that pre
-
war
 
tim e, ec onomic  
c irc umstanc es were diffic ult and I think you told me his bus ines s  was  having a tough tim e in thos e ear ly 

year s .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  Im por t
-
export bus ines s
, 
whic h he was  dealing in food, s pec ialty 
food, was  not good at all.  There was  a kind of depres s ion in Fr anc e like ther e was  in this c ountry als o.  
So it was  ver y diffic ult to ear n a living.  He had an as s oc iate who I will pr obably tell you later on was  

very good to him.  His  ass oc iate was  not J ewis h.  And the firm
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After Hitler annexed Aus tria and Czechos lovakia, your par ents left Par is with you and 

your  s is ter Manuela for  a s hort time.  Tell us  what you c an
 
--
 
knowing you were very little and you 
per s onally don't r em ember  that as  muc h
 
--
 
what you c an about their leaving Par is  that first time and 
then what happened to your fam ily dur ing that period befor e Germ any invaded Poland and the war  

began in Septem ber
 
1939.  Something prom pted your  par ents to leave Paris .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  My parents had no intention of leaving Paris  in thos e days . When things  

bec am e bad, and that was  r eally after  Poland was  invaded and Hitler invaded Luxembourg, Belgium 
and Holland, m y father  wrote to his  c ous in.  He had a c ous in who lived in Pales tine.  My father wr ote to 
his  c ous in that he was  going to
 
join the Dutc h forc es .  Then Fr anc e was  invaded.  No one was  allowed 
to leave.  So that was  the tim e pr obably when m y par ents  s aid
, ﬁWe
're going to live together
.  W
e'r e 
going to die together.
ﬂ  
> > Bill Bens on:  During that period, I think it was  in Mar c h 1939, the war  wouldn't begin until 
September.  In Mar c h of 1939, your parents  had you and your  s ister dec lared Fr enc h c itizens .  Tell us  
about that.  Why was  that s ignific ant? 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  That's an interes ting point bec aus e you as  Am er icans realize that in 
this  countr y if you ar e born in the c ountr y, you ar e a c itizen of the c ountr y.  In Fr anc e, no.  I was  born in 
Paris .  My s is ter was  born in Paris .  But we wer e Dutc h citizens .  My father
 
--
 
I have the dec laration 
hanging on the wall in m y plac e where I live.  My father r eques ted for  us to bec om e Fr enc h, to become 

bec aus e we were really Dutc h.
  
A few months  after, if you look on the other  s ide, it's  typewr itten in red, 
we wer e dec lared Fr ench.
  
And then m y father and parents  s aid, ok
, the gir ls ar e Frenc h.  Of c ours e we 
were J ewis h
 w
hic h was  not a plus  in thos e days .
 
 
Well, I'm going to jum p ahead, I guess .  At the time Hitler [Inaudible], turning m any agains t 
J ews .  Whoever had becom e Frenc h by natur alization los t the Frenc h c itizenship.  So, in fact, dur ing 

the whole length of the war  we wer e Dutc h J ews .  We wer e not Frenc h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had it taken away from  you, your Fr enc h citizens hip.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  I found out not s o m any year s ago that I bec ame Fren
c h again, if 

you want, in 1947.  So it was  way after Wor ldWar II.  I didn't k now all of thos e details , of c ourse.
 

4 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To this  day you'r e s till finding out new things.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Well, yes .  Yes.  I k eep on finding out either
 
fr om  the Ar c hives , fr om the 
m any books  that I r ead, fr om the his tory of Franc e andWorldWar II.  Even though m y book  was  written 
in 2013, pr etty s oon it will be two year s  ago, actually, in the sum mer , I have to put a s ec ond edition out.  
I have mor e things  that I found out at this  late date.  It's strange.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After war  broke out in Septem ber
 
1939, your fam ily left Par is  for their s ec ond time but 
r eturned a s hort while later .  And then in May
 
1940 when Germany attacked the low c ountries , inc l
uding 
Fr ance
 
--
 
well, they invaded Fr anc e in J une of 1940.  Your fam ily fled Paris  for  a third time.  But, again, 
r eturned to Paris.  Tell us  why your par ents  would flee Par is  but then they would retur n.  Tell us  what 

that was  about. 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels
 
Bir n:  Yeah.  That was  the exodus .  Millions  of people left Belgium, in the 
N
or theast, and Franc e.  Paris  had been dec lar ed open c ity.  So the Germans  wer e all over.  My father 
was  able to tak e a little van, [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language], and my s is ter and I were s itting in the 
bac k  with our doll, our bes t that we had s inc e 1940, and m y father  started dr iving.  He took  the small 

r oads  to avoid the bombardments  bec aus e the Germ ans were s ending
 
--
 
ther e is  ac tually s omebody 
that you pr obably know who was  fleeing like us, like we did.  His  aunt and unc le
 
--
 
I don't know how 
m any people
 
--
 
his  fam ily  died r ight ther e and then.  So we wer e very luc ky. We got to a plac e and m y 
father knock ed at the door and s aid
, ﬁ Could you hous e us  for the night?ﬂ
  
The fam ily
, just wonderful 
people, they kept us three weeks .  They never acc epted any m oney.  There wer e two gir ls.  I was  the 

younges t.
  
After  an am ount of time, m y father  s aid, well, I have to go back  to Paris , I have to ear n a 
living.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
>> J
acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  That was  ver y fortunate that he dec ided.  Firs t of all, he [Inaudible], but it 
was  after the dis as ter.  So the far mers
 
--
 
you don't have the m ap now.  They dec ided
 
--
 
m y father was  
ther e in a little van.  They gave us  two tanks  of gas .  So we wer e able to go back to Paris .
 
 
What I found out m any y ear s  after  is that Hitler s igned another law that we were not allowed to 
go back to Par is .  So that was  in September
 
1940.  And we got back before that.  So we were bac k  in 
P ar is .  Nothing 
happened.  My parents
 
--
 
the apartment, that's it.  But the big differ enc e
 
--
 
m y parents  
kept a journal.  It's  in the m us eum now.  My father wrote that they s aw s oldier s  and they wer e fighting.  

And the Germ ans  were ther e.  That was  the oc c upied par t of Franc e.  They wer e beaten down by the 
Germ ans.  And m y father  wr ote, "
No
w we know what is  going to happen to us ."
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you have
 
--
 
he gave that journal but you had thos e for all of thos e years .
 
 
I'm going 
to 
take you back  a little bit for a m
oment.  Prior  to the family
 -  
the invas ion, I think, of 
Fr a
nce by Germ any or shortly thereafter , at one point your  parents tr ied to leave for  a Dutc h c olony but 
they did not do.  So what happened there? 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  They tr ied
 
--
 
by that t
ime m en c ould not leave the c ountr y.  It was  after 
the dec lar ation of war .  And Franc e dec lar ed that all m en had to stay ar ound and join the Army.  Ther e 
were Frenc h s oldiers.  Women were not in the Arm y in thos e days  although they worked in infirmar ies  

in
 
other c apac ities.  So it never happened. We had plans . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Plans to leave.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  So it was  impos s ible.  Then on the 18th of June
 
1940, s aid Fr anc e did not 
los e the war, Fr anc e los t the battle.  That was  ver y optimis tic  on his  par t.
 
 
My m other wr ote to m e, but year s  later, oh, we should have followed the road but how c ould 
we?  We had hardly any m oney and two little girls.  So I think  that's  why my father s aid either we liv e 

together or  die together. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you told us about the exodus  out of Par is, that was  literally thous ands  and 
thousands  of people fleeing any way they c ould.  Your fam ily was  in a wor k  van.  Do
 
you
 
remember 
what you took  with you?
 

> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  My doll.  My bes t doll.
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  Your m other had a s ewing mac hine.  You threw a few things together and took  off with 
liter ally tens of thous ands  of people.
 

5 
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  My parents  s ay in their  jour nal, for us , for the c hildr en, s aying the 
s ewing 
m ac hine, typewr iter, we c an earn a living any wher e in the world.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you s aid a few m inutes  ago, 
you 
did c ome back to Paris  bec aus e your  father  
felt he needed work. We m entioned the oc cupied and unoc c upied portions .  Des c r ibe for us wh
at 
Vic hy, Fr anc e, was . What did that m
ean to have a 
divided Fr ance? 
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Hitler  and 
Petain
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  He was  the leader of Fr anc e at that tim e, Petain.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes , the leader  of s o
-
c alled 
f
re
e Franc e, whic h I never ac c ept f
r ee 
Fr ance.  His  headquarter was  in Vic hy.  But ac tually
 
--
 
I'm going ahead.  The Am eric ans  landed in a 
Fr ench poss es s ion.  And Hitler was  fur ious .  He said, ok, jus t going to invade all of Fr anc e, that's  it.  No 

more fr
ee Franc e or  s
o-
called 
f
r ee Franc e.  He dec ided on the date.  And that was  November
 
11, 1942
, 
r ight after  we had arr ived in our little village.  That was  the Armis tic e of the Fir s tWor ldWar.  So that's  
the date that was  c hos en.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In Septem ber
 
1940, your father returns to Paris .  You're in Paris .  You s tayed in Paris  
until the s umm er of 1942 when your  parents arr anged for  the four of you, for the family to leave Paris .  
T
ell us about the arr angements to leave Par is  and where you went fr om  there in the s ummer of 1942.
 
>>
 
J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Fir s t I s hould s ay that in 1941 there were all kinds of laws  agains t the 
J ews .  My father was  not allowed to be a bus ines s m an.  You c ould be a Jewis h doc tor, dentis t, 

gover nm ent em ployee, teac her  or anything
 
--
 
any 
pr ofes s ion.  He had to s ign
 
--
 
I have the papers  whic h 
I found after  m y father died.  He went to a notary
, a
 
lawyer  or  an attorney.  He had to s ign.  When I s ee 
his  handwr iting, I'm extr emely thank ful.
  
So he didn't have a job anym or e.  Fortunately his  as s
oc iate 
was  a very good man.  He was  not J ewis h.  My father s old his  bus ines s, shar es  of the bus ines s , for a 

pitiful am ount, you know.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Whic h he was  for c ed to do.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  So he didn't have an inc om e. 
 
> > Bill B ens on:  So finally, it's tim e to leave P ar is.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Well, not exac tly.  My par ents  still s tayed in Par is .  My father r egistered at 

the loc al City Hall when we lived in Paris  and s aid [Inaudible] and they would leave us  alone.  Wis hful 

th
inking on their  par t.  I think he went to wor k  by bic yc le.  It was ver y danger ous .
  
The polic e was  as king 
for paper s all the time.  [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language]
 I
f they had c aught my father, and J ews  were 
allowed in the las t tr ain
, 
that would have been
 
the end. 
 
So I'm not sur e.  They would s ay it was  
hor rible, it was  horrible.  I had a feeling that my father went to wor k  and hid in one of the back r ooms  in 

c as e s omebody r ang the bell.
 
 
Later on, J ews  wer e not allowed to us e a bic yc le.  My s is ter and I
 
were jus t lear ning to r ide our 
bikes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But no longer allowed to us e it.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Lived ar ound the corner fr om the zoo.  We c ouldn't go to the zoo.  We 

c ould go to s c hool.  But in 1942, we had to wear  the J ewis h s tar.  My s is ter r eminds  m e that
 
--
 
it was  on 
a Sunday, by the way, that we had to wear our J ewis h s tar, yellow, bright yellow.  I told my mother, 
" O
h, it's s o pr etty, yellow on m y gr een s weater ."  But m y 
sister
, 20 months older , was  c alled to the head 
of the c las
sr oom.  The teac her s aid to the whole c las s , "
Y
ou have to be very nic e to this  little gir l 
bec aus e s he's  living in ver y hard tim es."  And that was  ver y brave of the teac her .  Bec aus e the kids  
c ould go home and s ay, oh, there's  a J ewis h kid, and that would be the end of the teac her  and the end 
of us, too.  That went like that all the time.  That's  why I say ever y day was  a mirac le.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to go back  a little bit ear lier .  In late 1941, your mother  r ec eived es s entially a 
farewell letter  fr
om her mother, I believe. Will you s ay a little about that?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  It's a ver y s ad s tor y.  My grandmother
 
--
 
m y father had tried to get 
h
er  out of Hamburg.  She s aid, "Oh, I have m y piano.
ﬂ
  
ﬁ Nothing will happen to me
"  "
I
'll b
e s afe."  My 
father said in the jour nal that it was  full of the German s was tika
 
--
 
would never  go to Germ any again.  
He was  not able to get her  out.  So they took  away her apartment, m y grandmother .  The polic e took  

6 
 
the lis t, s he had 18 pair s of s hoes or something.  They put her in a J ew hous e.  So s he didn't have an 
apar tm ent anymore. 
 
 
She dec ided to put an end to her life bec aus e the next day s he had rec eived an or der for  
tr ans port.  And s he knew s he was  going to be s ent to a c onc entration c amp.  So s he took  an overdos e 
of s leeping pills .  She never us ed the word s uic ide in the letter but
 
m y m other 
--
 
s he s aid far ewell to the 
four of us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
As I 
recall, for your  mother , that m ay have tr iggered her idea about what s he would do 

if you were all taken at som e futur e point.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  Exac tly.  My m other
 
--
 
first of all, I was  ter ribly afraid of the 
Germ ans.  They lived one flight up from  us.  There was  a J ewis h family that had fled.  Ger man s oldier s  
m oved in.  Later on they m oved into our apar tm ent.  And s o they were ups tairs .  Once they knocked on 

the door or  r ang the bell, and I opened the door and I s ee a pair of boots
 a
s  tall as m e.  Maybe I was n't 
wear ing m y J ewis h s tar, I don't know
, b
ut they c los ed the door and they
 
went through the others. 
 
 
What was your question? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your gr andm other wrote her  letter, it br ought your m other to m ake a dec is ion. 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  My m other , at that tim e, told us , m y s ister and me and my father m us t 
hav
e been ther e, too, I gues s .  She s aid, 
ﬁD
on't worr y.
ﬂ
  
She knew I was  so afr aid of the Germans  in 
general, the soldiers .  "
I
f the Germ ans c om e to get us, I will give you a little pill.  And you will die r ight 
away.  And you will never  s uffer ."  She did tha
t. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She did that.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  I m ean s he s aid that. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In J uly
 
1942, ther e was  a mas s ive roundup of J ews  in Paris .  It was  s hortly after  that 
that your fam ily pac ked up and left.  Tell us about the departure
 
and then where you went from ther e.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Took plac e in 16 and 17 of J uly
 
1942. We were registered.  The order to 
the Fr enc h polic e was  to r ound up 27,000 J ews , m os tly in the J ewis h s ec tion of Par is .  I m ean there 
were other  J ews  but we 
lived
 
--
 
ther e was  a c hurch, a town hall, all the normal things of a Frenc h town.  
There was  a s ynagogue, ac tually, high up in the top of that s uburb, if you want.
 
After the roundup, wher e they forgot to r ing our bell
 
--
 
as I s ay in my book, they c ame one week after 
we fled.  My father got in touch
 
--
 
m y father was  Dutc h.  He r emained Dutc h.  He asked if anybody  
knew pas s eur
 
--
 
what is that?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like a sm uggler . 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  So he was  given two s m uggler s, ver y young.  He had to pay a lot of 

m oney.  I don't know wher e he got the m oney.  They pr om is ed that they wer e going to let us illegally 

c r os s the border .  In J uly and August
`
42, they s ealed the zones . We lived in Paris , in the occ upied 
zone.  So we wer e full of s oldier
s. 
> > Bill Bens on:  The plan was  to sm uggle you into the unoc c upied zone.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Right.  That was  not an eas y thing to do.  We were illegal.  You 
needed
 
--
 
in or der to travel, as  Jews , we needed a vis a and s om ething in Germ an, a perm i
t, firs t to 
follow vis a.  As  J ews , of c our s e, we c ouldn't get anything like that.  If we tr ied to go anywhere, we wer e 
ill
egal. We wer e not allowed to leave, period. 
 
 
So my parents , we had a wonder ful neighbor upstairs .  We took  s ome of our  valuables , 
we
dding pr es ents of m y par ents, my piggy bank  that c ame fr om m y grandm other , and m y mother's little 
piano that they tr ans ported that night.  I don't know how they did it.  The conc ier ge was  a very good 

per s on and never denounc ed us . 
 
The las t night we had dinner  at a ver y good friend's  that lived v er y 
c los e to the s top.  They said don't travel with any luggage.  My parents had their belongings in a 
bac kpack.  That's  all. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J us t a little backpack.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  I didn't even have
 
m y 
doll
.  I had nothing.  And m y s is ter, we wer e hand
-
in
-
hand.  We s pent the night there.  That's  when the lady of the hous e gave me my medal whic h I have 
to this  day.  It was  a wonderful Catholic  fam ily, lik e m ost Fr enc h people are, Catholic .  It's Notr e
 
Dame 

7 
 
de Lour des.  She s ay
, ﬁT
hat will pr otec t you.
ﬂ
  
My s is ter has  one alm ost s im ilar .  I have m ine that she 
gave us .  Maybe it did s ave us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your s ister s till has  hers, too, right?
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you s lipped out and you made your  way out of Paris .  You ended up in the village of 
Le Got.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Not s o quickly.
 
> > B ill Bens on:  No. 
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Unfortunately.  We s pent
 
the
 
night.  We left at 6:00
 
in the m or ning.
  
My 
par ents s till had their I.D. c ard wher e
 
--
 
they didn't have fals e paper s .  They didn't have perm its to go 
any where.  The two boys  in the fam ily, in that family, there was  Michel Par is  and a fr iend also c alled 

Mic hel from the lady ups tairs  from our apar tm ent, they had gotten tickets  for us bec aus e we wer e not 
allowed to buy tickets , of c our s e.  They als o c ar ried the backpack s .  They left that in the other s tation.  
Paris  has  s everal s tations .  So we left at 6:00
 
in the m orning.
 
 
They
 
--
 
our  fr iends took
 
our  Jewis h star s  and burned them .  They tur ned on the heating s ys tem 
jus t for  that.  Obvious ly we c ouldn't tr avel with J ewis h s tar.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So that was  a huge r isk  when you went out to the Metr o.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Abs olutely. We wer e only allowed in the last train of the Metr o.  At 

6:00
 
ther e was  no polic e.  So we got to the tr ain station.  My parents
 
--
 
I think  the two boys  m et us.  
They got the tickets for us, the train tickets
, a
nd our  backpacks , whic h they had s tor ed for us  bec aus e
, 
of c ours e, we were not allowed to c ar ry anything it would have looked like we were
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tr ying to leave.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Fleeing.  Yeah.  We got on the train.  That's s om ething I r em em ber very 

c lear ly
. T
he train wouldn't leave, wouldn't leave, wouldn't leave.  My father  bec ame fr antic .  He went to 
the head of the train and as ked what's  going on.  T he wom an that was  ther e s ays , "Oh, they'r e 

r ounding up J ews  on the other  s ides of the tracks."  That m or ning they mus t have had a num ber of 
J ews  that they needed
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like their  quota, meeting their quota.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  A number of J ewis h families  on that tr ain.  So our train was  not 

vis ited
,  
if I m ay s ay s o
,  
and the tr ains  left.
  
Then we had to c hange tr ains  in a little town in Fr anc e.  It's  
too bad we don't have the m ap.  We had to c hange tr ains.  My s is ter fell.  She fell on her head.  To this  

day, not that s he has  a pain but s he c an feel that that's  what happened.  And that was  another mirac le.  
If she had had a c onc us sion, we would have had to go to a 
hos pital
.  And at the hos pital, they would 
have s een "
J
ew" and that would have been the end.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You didn't have your s tar .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  No, but m y parents had their paper s.  And so my s is ter was  able to get 
bac k  on the little tr ain, the little c ountry train. We went to the village where we wer e s uppos ed to meet 
the sm ugglers.  But they
 
c am e to get us and they s aid, "W
e c an't take you."  I don't know if they were 
taking 
another J ewis h fam ily or  if it was  too danger ous  but we had to go to a hotel.
 
 
The next day
 
--
 
it was  hot, it was  Augus t
 
1.  I remem ber resting under  a tree.  We had to walk 
10
 
kilometers . We got to the m eeting plac e at m idnight, behind a c hur c h, in the c
emetery of that little 
town and they were there. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The smuggler s were there.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the cros s ing of the dem ar c ation line was  extrem ely 

danger ous  bec aus e we wer e ther e
 
in the fores t.  It was  s ummer 
but
 
it was  wet in the m iddle of the 
night.  And the Germ ans wer e ther e.  I r emember s eeing the s moke of their c igar ettes .  My father 
wr ote
 
--
 
he r emember ed ther e was  a motorc yc le.  But for tunately for us ther e were none of thos e 
vic ious  dogs , those Germ an She
pherds  that
 
were tr ained.  And to this  day
 
I c an't s tand German 
Shepherds .  I'm s orr y but 
--
 
I know people say their wonderful dogs but for  m e it's not.  It's not a happy 
thought. 
 
 
They had bic yc les .  One was  the s on
 
--
 
they wer e about 20 year s old.
 

8 
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on:  The smuggler s.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  They lived in that area.  And one of them  was  the s on of a bak er  
and the other one was  a farm er.  So they knew every little plac e.  One of them went ahead.  We heard 
a s m all whis tling with m y fa
ther s aying you can go or you c an c om e thr ough that pass age.  And the 
s ec ond sm uggler put my s is ter  and me on this  bicyc le.  So to go faster. 
 
Firs t we wer e on the gr ound, 
bec aus e we were s o c los e.  And at that tim e m y s is ter s aid, "I have to do pee, pee."
  
It sounds funny 
but it was  tr agic bec aus e if they had hear d
, 
that would have been the end of us.  Everything like that 
was  a m irac le.
 
 
We made it.  We k new that the pass age was  c lear bec aus e there was  a c ontingent of Frenc h 
s oldier s  that was  permitted be
tween Petain and Hitler.  So the Fr enc h s oldiers  s aid [Speaking 

Non
-
Englis h Language], 
ﬁW
ho goes  ther e?
ﬂ
  
So we knew they were good people.  They took us to their  
bar racks.  They spent the night on, I don't know, s ome kind of
 
--
 
what s oldiers  us e.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  Like a hamm ock ?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Something.  Yeah.  And the next morning they s aid, 
"W
e c an't keep you."  
They took  us and esc orted us  to a town, like a sub c apital.  Franc e is divided like here, states .  And 

eac h s tate has  a c apital. 
 
And there's a s ub c apital.  So it was  a s ub c apital.  My par ents didn't know 
anybody.  So they m oved into a hotel
, a
 
s m all hotel.  But hotel, you had to give your  paper s.  And it s aid 
"J ew
."  
 
 
So we took  a r oom .  8:00
 
p.m., knock at the door, polic e.  My
 
par ents  wer e ar rested.  My 
m other  was  interr ogated for 15 minutes.  Then m y father was  inter rogated for  15 m inutes .  They had to 

s ay that they wer e of the J ewis h rac e and that they were not c r iminal, that they wer e bor n m y father  
so-
and
-
s o, m y m other s o
-a
nd
-
s o.  That's where if they had been s mar t enough, they s hould have s aid, 
oh, s he was  born in Germ any.  They s hould have, c ould have, would hav e put her in a 
c onc entr ation 
c am p for Germ an J ews .  But they didn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  in Franc e.
 
>> Jacqu
eline Mendels  Bir n:  Oh, yeah.  And then they tr ans ported.  We were under es c or t again.  
They tr ans ported us  to the c apital.  My par ents  wer e interr ogated again at length.  It was  up to the
 
--
 
we 
were not put in pr is on or  in a c am p.  It was  up to the head of that department, like a governor her e, to 
dec ide whether to put us in a c am p or to s end us  to get lost in the c ountry
, i
n the c ountrys ide.
 
Bec aus e m y par ents declar ed they had a little money, m y father s aved 4,000
 
fr
anc s  and m y mother 
s aved 4,000 f
r anc s
.  They had to pay a fine.  That's  another s tor y.  My father  als o s aid he had a friend 
who had s om e m oney, like 25,000 Franc s .  Maybe it was  his  as s oc iate fr om Par is  who had his  s har es , 

m y father's  s har es .  To this  day I don't know.  Or was  he bluffing?  I
 
don't know.
 
 
Bec aus e of that, the man in c harge
 
--
 
I found his  nam e later on
 
--
 
who was  pr obably a good 
m an
, 
s aid, 
ﬁO
k
.  W
e are not putting them  in a c am p.
ﬂ
  
Fr ance had
 
m any, m any c amps.  They s aid "G
o 
get los t." We had to s pend one m onth in [Inaudible].
  
Move
d 
to a little hotel.  We were s leeping eating 
in thos e s oup kitc hens .  But I don't r emem ber  that it tasted too bad.  My parents had to r eport every 

day.  They wer e being watched
 b
ut they wer e not im pr is oned.
 
 
At the end of the m onth
 
--
 
ther e was  probably a notar y that was  wor king pro bono, in our 
behalf.  I have all of those paper s.  In 1997 I found them thanks to the Ar chiv is t.
  
So at the end of the 
m onth we were allowed to go not more than 100
 
k ilom eter s, in a little, little village.  Frantic ally my
 
par ents s earc hed for a plac e which was  extremely  tiny hous es .  We found two room s . We wer e 

ups tair s.  There was  no elec tric ity, no heat, no toilet, no water , no nothing.  But we had two r oom s.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  in Le Got?
 
> > J acqueline Mendel
s  Bir n:  Yes . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I want to m ake s ur e you'r e able to take s om e time to tell us  about that per iod bec aus e 
you wer e in Le Got for 29 m onths .  You lived there in this little village.  Tell us  what you c an in the little 
tim e we have what life was
 
like for you living in Le Got. 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Wel
l, ther e was  a m ayor .  His  nam e, 
Paul
 
--
 
I was  able to have him  
dec lar ed r ighteous  among the nations bec ause he literally s aved us  fr om the death c amps .  He kept on 

telling us that we c ould do that and we could do that and we couldn't do that.  He gave us  tem porary 

9 
 
per mit, where we c ould go to the next village to either  go to the doc tor or to buy som e m eat or  
s om ething.  But Satur days  only.  If you wer e s ick and had a tooth ac he in the middle 
of the week , 
tough.  Of c our s e that's als o when my mother  becam e pr egnant.  My m other  didn't dar e get out of thos e 
two room s.
 
 
My s is ter and I, thanks  to the mayor, we went
 
--
 
we only us ed our first names , Manuela and 
J ac queline. We never us ed Mendels  whic h was  a J ewis h nam e.  My s is ter remem bers our las t nam e 

was  Frederic k .  I don't r ec all.  But the m as ter  and mis tr es s , they wer e hus band and wife.  I was  with the 
little one with her and s he was  with him.  They wer e als o in the underground.  Like the m ayor
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  So the m ayor was  a member of the Frenc h underground?
 

> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  Actually lived a long time.  I never  got to meet him again whic h is  

r eally a s ham e.  I thought he had died.  But I m et their  s on who was  born one year  after.  We 
c or r es pond, Skype.  It's  wonder ful.  Bec aus e they s tayed in Franc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e in a little village.  So everybody knows  ever ybody.  Did the other  villagers 
know that you we
r e a J ewis h fam ily liv ing in their mids t?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  I think
 
s o.  
I think
 
so
.  What did they know about J ews ?  You know?  They 
were poor  farm ers, real, you know, peas ant
s
.  But they wer e very, as  we s ay in Fr enc h, [Speaking 
Non
-
Englis h Language], they wer e not loyalis ts , they wer e for the republic .  They wer e ver y 
anti
-
Germ an.  Let's not forget that Franc e had had s o many s oldiers  that died in the Fir s t Wor ld War 
and als o by gas  and
 
--
 
I m ean, ther e were m illions  of people that died in WorldWar II.  They hated the 
Germ ans.  So they knew that we had fled the Germans .
  
I don't know who knew that they found out 
that
 
--
 
that m y parents had thos e death pills.  But way after  the war, a neighbor downs tairs  said that m y 
par ents were 
c
arrying under
 
their ves ts thos e pills  at all times.
 
 
We went to s c hool.  I don't think we learned m uch but we did go for a while.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nobody denounc ed you? 
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  No.  Nobody denounc ed us .  And the m ayor protected us.  So we went in 

the woods .  My father  was  in hiding in a dilapidated plac e wher e he couldn't lie, c ouldn't stand.  I think  

the farmer's  wife br ought him s om e food.  Onc e in a while he c ame hom e.
  
At firs t he had a bic yc le but 
then the tir es wor e down s o he was  r iding on t
he m etal.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So the m ayor, if ther e was  a Germ an patr ol c oming, he would s ay they were c om
ing 
and then your father would hide?
 

> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  And we would go into the woods .  One tim e we went into a c hicken co
o
p.  
I gues s it was
 
not winter  bec aus e I don't r emember being c old.  Onc e the m ayor  s aid it's too 
danger ous
. m
y parents agreed for the gir ls  to stay.  They wanted to put us  in a c onvent
 
--
 
in a very 
famous little town. We prepared a little bag.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To have you hide in this c onvent?  That was  the idea?
 

> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  The las t day the mayor s aid don't go bec aus e there's going to be 

tanks  and it's  too dangerous  for  the two little gir ls .  So we didn't go.  It's a good thing we didn't go 
bec aus e 
ther e was  a raid later on.  The Germans cam e and asked if ther e wer e any J ewis h girls , 
J ewis h people.  And, of cour s e, that would have been the end of us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned a m oment ago your  m other  had a baby.  So in the s ummer  of 1943, 
your  mother has  a baby whic h mus t have m ade circ umstanc es a little m ore diffic ult for  everybody.  But 
before you tell us  about that, tell us about your  little brother's  name.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Befor e I get to that, I have to tell you that my parents
- - 
that's  in our  
journal.  My parents  took  m e on their knees  and m y s is ter on m y father's  knees, and they s aid, 
ﬁY
ou 
know we have no m oney and ther e will be no birthday pr es ents but ther e will be s omething that will s tay 

with us  for the r es t of our lives .
ﬂ   
And my s is ter  got exc ited it was  going to be a baby.  That was  in 
May
 `
43.  
 
 
We k new m y m other was  very s ick .  I wrote her  little notes.  We didn't have any paper . We had
 
--
 
I don't know, found a little s om ething and I wr ote to her, "I hope tomorr ow you feel better."  And on
c e 

10
 
 
s he had to go to the doctor  
dur ing the pregnanc y to that next village.  It m us t have been a Saturday.  I 
r em em ber my s ister and I were pus hing her .  She was  wearing a night gown.  She didn't have 
pr egnanc y c lothes , you k now.  Neither did we hav e any kind of c lothes.  We had wooden s hoes . We 
pus hed her bec aus e s he c ouldn't m ake it up the hill.  That's  s omething that's  in m y head always .  So 
s he went to the doctor. 
 
 
In the m eantim e, s omething I found way after is  that they wer e r oundin
g up Dutc h J ews  als o, 
not only Eas t European J ews .  So it was  another m irac le that they didn't round us  up.
 
 
My m other, as I s aid, was  ver y s ic k .  Ther e was  a woman that was
 
s upposed to c ome.  I don't 
even think  s he was  a m idwife.  She was  going to do the bir th but the future baby was  in a br eac h 

pos ition and my m other was  bleeding.  They had to tr ans por t her.  Of c ours e s he was  not allowed to 
tr avel.  She had to go to the c l
os est hospital, clinic , where they were tak ing care of German s oldiers , 

too. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In that same c linic . 
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  So there was a German on one s ide, a J ewis h woman about to give 
bir th, a guy about to die on the other  side.  And the doc tor  was  als o a wonderful man.  His wife was  the 
nur s e.  They m anaged to s ave my mother and to perm it m y brother  to be bor n, whic h was  als o a 
tr agedy bec aus e my mother  w
as  too s ick to give m ilk  and
 
c ow m ilk 
didn't agree with my br other.  So
 
the 
nur s e s aid, 
ﬁO
h, what a bad baby.
ﬂ
  
Well, the c ow's  milk  didn't agr ee with him, period.  And my mother 
s pent thr ee weeks.  She s ur vived.  She los t a lot of blood.  She had AB plus  like m e but they never  

as ked me.  I don't know where they found blood f
or  her .  My father wr ote, "not only do I have to wor ry 
about m y wife s ur viv ing and m y baby, I have to worr y about the gir ls  in that little village."  And my 

par ents, at that time, and before
 
--
 
they had no r adio, no news , no nothing.  They thought that the
y 
were going to give m y brother the nam e Franklin.  You know why?

[Inaudible]
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yup.  Bec aus e they felt that Roos evelt was  going to s ave us.  So they 

nam ed my br other Fr ank lin.  If it had been a gir l, they would have named he
r  Mar
ianne 
bec aus e that 
was  the s ym bol of Fr ance. 
 
 
Then m y par ents got back  to the village with the baby.  Another mir ac le, my father found 
Nestle
 
--
 
it still exis ts , Nes tle Condens ed Milk.  And m y mother  s om ehow found a bottle or two. We had 
to go and g
et water at the pum p, m y s is ter  and me.  She was  able.  And that agreed with him.  When 
that c an, a tin c an, was  empty, I licked the bottom. We didn't have m uc h food.  We had c hes tnuts .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did 
you 
m anage to eat dur ing that period, 29 mon
ths?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  A lot of c hestnuts.  My m other m ade puree, br ead, anything with 

c hes tnuts .  There were als o walnuts .  I r em ember s eeing m y father peeling the outs ide and then the 
ins ide bec aus e they wer e s till green.  His hands bec am e all
 
black .  And then s he c ook ed them with 
wood.  She was
 
--
 
m y father  was  in hiding.  She was  c hopping the wood.  She was  telling the neighbor, 
ﬁ
I have to be very c ar eful bec aus e I'm a pianis t and I don't want to hur t m y hand.

[Laughter ]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You c an't do justic e to that period of tim e in this  s hort tim e we have.  You lived there 
for 29 months.  Of c ourse, the allies  landed in Nor m andy in J une
 
1944.  By Augus t, Paris  was  liber ated.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Augus t
 
28. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  August
 
28.  An im por tant date.  And with that, your father m ade the dec is ion I'm  going 
bac k  to Paris.  Tell us  about that tim e.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  I don't know how he went bec aus e the tr ains , tr ack s , ever ything was  
des tr oyed.  Whether he went by bic ycle, by foot, I don't know but he dec ided.  And it was  Novem ber s o 
it was  s hortly after the liberation of Par is .  The Germ ans were s till ther e.  Ac tually, the divis ion was  

going
 
--
 
I r emem ber s eeing the tank s  and looking out the window.  My m other s aid go down on your 
feet
 
bec aus e they c ould have s hot me r ight ther e.
 
 
So my father made it to Par is .  He wanted to know if he had a bus ines s .  He wanted to k now if 
we had an apartm ent.  And if 
w
e could go back to Par is .
  
It was  a very s mart thing of him to do that 
bec aus e whoever was  a refugee was given whatever  apar tm ent.  Our apartment was  oc c upied the 

whole tim e, the 29 m onths , by Germ an soldiers .  So as  my mother wr ote, it was  in s ham bles .  But the 

11
 
 
apar tm ent was  empty.  They had fled, the Germ an s oldier s , of c ours e.  So the c onc ierge or s omebody 
s aid go to the Town Hall and s ee if ther e is  anything left that used to belong to you.  My father s aid, 
yeah, that's our dr es s er , that's  our  bed which had been s lit bec aus e the Germ ans were looking for  
m oney but they never found any.  He got the bed back.  Yeah.  So we had a few things.
 
 
In late Novem ber
 
--
 
s o he went back.  And then the Mendels  fam ily
 
--
 
it took  three days  to get 
bac k  to Paris.  Now it only takes  three hours.  We had to c hange trains.  My brother
 
--
 
that 
was  in 
Novem ber
 `
44, s o he was  a year and a few months .  He was , I guess , s tar ved.  Ther e was  no m ore 
food.  He was  s c r eaming.  My m other m ust have c ar ried s om ething.  I don't know how my par ents did 

it.  We had to c hange tr ains , of c our s e, I don't know how m any times.  And m y father  s aid we have to 
get identity c ards, ID c ards .  And now it won't say J ews  bec aus e the Germans  were fleeing. 
 
 
We got back to Par is.  We s tayed with the wonderful fr iends  who had the hous es  the las t night.  
I don't know how m any weeks we s pent th
ere.
  
My  father's busines s was  gone.  He was  s elling jam 
fr om  door

t
o try to m ake a living.  Little by little he found out that everybody in Holland was  
dead.  His  m other, his  brother, his  s is ter, all the c los es t.  Then he s aid
, ﬁ
I'm not looking an
ymore 
bec aus e they ar e all dead.
ﬂ 
> > Bill Bens on:  Over  200 mem ber s that you know about.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  And my s is ter  and I were offer ed a four
-
year  s cholar s hip in a 
wonder ful private s c hool in our  neighborhood so we c ould c atc h up becaus e we had a lot to learn
 t
hat 
we hadn't lear ned in those year s .  We did well.  And then we went to univers ity.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  By that tim e you were, what, 9 or 10?  Almos t 10 years  old
, 
9 year s  old.
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the little tim e we have left, I'm going to jump forwar d a long way, J ac queline.  J us t 
r ec ently you made s ur e that s om e of your r elatives  were mem or ialized.  Can you tell us  about it?  This  

is  pr etty r em arkable, I think.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  It i

Franc e
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Le Got was ?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  As one of the villages  of Franc e wher e they s aved fam ilies  fr om the 

death c amps.  Then, of cour s e, ther e's the mayor .
  
But
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It m eans s tum bling blocks .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  The Germ an m an who was  born after the war , 1945, who s tarted
 
--
 
I don't 
know how and why he s tar ted but he wanted to memorialize all of thos e J ews  that had been m ur dered.  
He
 
s tarted in Ber lin.  Then he went to all the oc c upied c ountries.  I found out that he was  going to the 
Hague.  I managed
 
--
 
we had to pay him.  He was  going to put a s tone with the date of birth of m y 
grandm other.  It's  about that s ize.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The stone is  about that big?  Ok .
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  Yeah.  So it has her birth date and her name and the date s he was  

r ounded up and the date s he was  m urder ed.  That's for  m y grandmother  and for  m y unc le, m y
 
--
 
my 
father's brother Bernard Mendels  and his  wife Annie Mendels .  So the thr ee of them  have a plaque in 
the ground. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You explained to me that us ually you tr y to put it at the home, the las t hom e where the 
per s on lived.
 
> > J acqueline Mendel
s  Bir n:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were not able to do it that way.
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  No.  Wher e they liv ed, their  last r es idenc e wher e they wer e rounded up, 

that was  c ompletely des tr oyed.  Holland r ec eived bom bs  all the way until J anuar y, Febr u
ar y
 `
45.  
Holland was  liberated very, ver y late.  That building was  des troyed entir ely.  But the m an that wor k ed 
for m e went to the 
A

would have been.

m or e than you wer e able to do in the per iod her e.  One las t ques tion, what has  this m eant to you t
o 
wr ite this  book
, to
 
wr ite your m em oir ?
 
> > J acqueline Mendels  Bir n:  It took m e s ix years .  I did a lot of res earc h.  It was  very painful.  I was  

working until 1:00
 
in the m or ning m any, many times .  My br other , who c omm itted s uic ide, m y br other 
Fr anklin, 
his  daughter J es s ic a was  m y editor, really, and photographer.  She worked very hard.  We 
were on the phone, on Skype, on e
-
m ail ever y night.  My daughter  helped m e trem endous ly.  She read 
the fir s t and s econd.  It was  thank s  to my s on
-
in

law, bec aus e I was
 
r ec over ing fr om a ver y bad illnes s .  
He s aid, 
ﬁW
hy don't you s tart writing at the age that you rem ember, 7 year s  old,
ﬂ 
like m y granddaughter 
was  at that tim e.  Now s he's  14.  And I s aid, 
ﬁB
ut how to s tart?ﬂ   And he s aid, "One s entenc e at a tim e."  
And I had m y little laptop and I started. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Whic h rem inds  m e, I need to ask  you one more thing if you'll bear  with us.  We didn't 
get to this . What is  the title of the book? What's  the s ignific anc e of the title of the book? 
 
> > J acqueline Mendel
s  Bir n:  Yes .  Fir st s entence is  "A dim anc he pr oc hain."  It's  a Fr enc h s aying "until 
next Sunday."  It's bec aus e every Sunday m or ning my parents
 
lifted their water and s aid, "L
et's  be alive 
one m ore week ."  Let's  hope to be alive one m or e week.  So when my
 
daughter and my niec e s aid how 
do you want to c all it, imm ediately I s aid "A dimanc he pr oc hain."
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One mor e week .
 
> > Jacqueline Mendels  Bir n:  One m ore week  of life. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's our tradition at
 
Fir s t Per s on
 
that our
 
First Person
 
gets the las t word.  So I'm going to 
tur n back to J acqueline to c los e the progr am  but firs t I want to thank  all of you for  being with us.  I 

r em ind you that we'll hav e
 
Firs t Pers on
 
pr ogr am s  each Wednes day and Thurs day through the m iddle of 
A ugust.  So I h
ope you can return another  time.  If not, maybe next year when we res um e
 
First Person
. 
 
Two things  before J acqueline c los es .  Our photographer, J oel, is  her e.  He did all of thos e 
inc r edible photos you s aw in the beginning.  He's going to c om e up on the s tage when J acqueline is  
done and take a photograph of her with you as  the back gr ound.  So I'm going to ask  you to stand at 
that point s o that we c an take that photograph.  And the s ec ond thing, when J acqueline's  done, s he's  
going to go up to the top, outs id
e s tairs, where she will s ign copies of her book  for  anybody who wants  
one.  So as soon as  s he's  done, we'r e going to try to get J acqueline off the s tage.  If you'll hang back  a 

little bit and let her get up the ais les .
 
 
On that note, J acqueline? 
 
>> Jacqu
eline Mendels  Bir n:  Yes .  You hear d a ver y s ad s tory.  Fr anc e was  not and Par is  was  not jus t 
the Eiffel Tower .  Always s ay that Franc e was  an ugly c ountr y for J ews  and many, m any of them wer e 

deported and never to c om e back .  And unfortunately there are other  genoc ides .  I s ee people of all 

ages her e but for the young people I always  s ay to them  tr y and find a pr ofes s ion
 
--
 e
ven for  older 
people.  Try and find a job
, t
r y and find s omething where you c an help people and not let, if pos s ible, 

other genoc ide 
oc c ur .  I m ean, there ar e natur al dis as ter s, I know.  And this  c ountry is  trying to help.  
And ther e was  a terrible dis as ter in China, a natural thing.  But ther e ar e so m any new Holoc aus ts , if 

you want, in Afr ic a, in the Middle Eas t, every wher e.  I always
 
s ay when I finis h s peaking, and I s peak  to 
a lot of people, don't s tand by; s tand up.  You c an s tand up in a little way, in a big way, in your  ever yday 

life but try and do s om ething to im pr ove this planet.
