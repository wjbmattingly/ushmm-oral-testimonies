EDDIE WILLNER 
May 25, 1989 
 
Q: O.K. I would like to begin by 
asking you your complete name.  
 
A: O.K. My complete name is Eddie He lmwood Willner. I was born with the name  
Helmwood Willner and the name  Eddie was give
n to me  later in Belgium as a refugee 
child.  
 

Q: When and where were you born?   

 

A: I was born on the 15th of August, 1926 in
 Munchglablak, Germany, which is We st 
Germany ne ar Cologne-Dusseldorf,
 a town of about 150,000 people.  
 

Q: Could you tell me  about how the Eddie came about?   

 

A: O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in Ge
rmany, my father decided at that time that 
his son has to get out of Germany if he cannot
 get out of Germany and my father was one 
of those Germans who believed because he se
rved the German Army in World War I, 
that they would not touch him since he was d
ecorated and in the begi
nning they did ma ke 
exceptions but later on it was all the same. When
 he decided it woul
dn't, it would be the 
same  like everybody else, he wanted to get me  out of Ger many so he sent me , they put 

me  on a train to Brussels, Belgium where I was 
picked up in Brussels by a Jewish refugee 
organization which placed me  with a Dutch fa
mily. And when I lived with this Dutch 
Jewish family, uh, I was of course sent to sc
hool and I was told that I could not have the 
name  Helmwood in Belgium it was too German
 and the Germans were still hated from 
World Wa r I so they gave me  the name  Eddi
e and I, the name  I kept since today, until 
today.  
 

Q: I am going to ask about the Dutch family, but  first I would like to ask about the taking 
leave of your parents. Do you reme mber saying goodbye to them?   
 

A: Yes, I reme mber saying goodbye to them. 
When the papers came  that I could, was 
allowed to leave Germany from the police, my
 father, uh, uh, had almost what I felt, we 
felt was a heart attack, but it wasn't  - he wa
s just over excited and uh he almost passed 
out and it was quite a thing for him a nd for my
 mother of course too to get me  out of 
Germany, to know me  on the safe uh side, and 
uh, it was, it was for me  as a boy, it wasn't  
as shocking as, because I was too young, it was a
lmost like going, being sent to an uncle 
or aunt in a faraway place, 
but uh, I, the only thing I was 
worried about was leaving my  
parents be hind. Because I knew at that time
 already what this was all about.  
 

Q: Did they give you anything to take with you ______________?   

 
A: No, I think the uh, uh, the uh, uh, laws at th
at time  were you couldn't take any shoes, 
extras, I could take my clothing along. No, I, 
I do have a kidoscop, a silver kidoscop, that 
I took along and that was about all. It
 was wrapped up in uh my clothing.

Q: Do you still have that?   

 

A: I still have that. And it wa
s saved by non-Jewish people.  
 

Q: You me ntioned your father had been
 in the German Army _____________ I understand 
________________  
 

A: Yes. Uh, which, uh, when Hitler came to 
power in 1933, uh, Germany wanted to rearm, 
of course, and, uh, the military, uh, were, uh, in vogue again and uniforms and uh me dals 

were being worn because  Hitler want ed a new 
army, a big army, and as a result, by Field 
Marshall Von Hindenberg, which was the President of Ger many, Hitler was the 

Chancellor, of course, they 
created the Iron, the Cross of 
Honor which was given, as I 
understand, to people like my, my fat her who had earned uh, the Iron Cross during Wo rld 

War I and who had served for four years on th
e front lines. In othe
r words, if he had 
served probably in the rear he probably woul
dn't get it. But it was given uh to a lot of 
people just because Hitler wanted to ma ke 
it popular again that the army is great and 
me dals are great and so on and to uh. So, my
 father was uh, was given by the authorities a 
certifi cate with a me dal which I still have 
to this day which was saved by a German 
Catholic family that he gave it to that had 
al so served with my father in World War I. 
And uh the certificate uh I, reads basically 
uh - in the name  of the Fuhrer and Reich 
Chancellor, which was Hitler, of course, give
n in my father's name , and uh, in uh, it gives 

the law that was passed to give this to pe
ople and I think it was a mi stake to give it 
probably to the Jews but some  of them 
slipped through. I don't know if everybody got it 
but I, I understand there are 
other people got it and uh, it sa
ys the Cross of Honor for  
front line combatants, and the date on it is, 
the, the name  of t he city, Muchenglabach 
(ph), is me ntioned on there, the 7t h December, 1934. And uh by order of the police 

president and uh, it is of course
 the swastika on it can be s
een and the stamp that is on 
there and the city seal and 
the certificate 1, W 1 F.  
 

Q: Do you have the me dal with you?   

 

A: Yes, I do have the me dal with me  too. This
 is the Iron Cross and this is the Cross of 
Honor which were, which was worn even on the uniform and some ti me s in a smaller, in a 

small version of it on 
civilian clothing.  
 

Q: And how we re you able to get these __________________?   

 

A: Well, my father had a, you cannot call it a 
wallet, but it is a leathe
r folder and I happened 
to know the story of this. He kept his war 
pictures in here. And, 
uh, the pictures, uh and 
some  other pictures were given, and plus these 
medals were stuck in, 
he had given to this 
fa mily and they gave it back to me . The leat
her wallet here, it is ve
ry heavy leather, and 
is, the story is that it was from a saddle, ah, ah, it was shot from underneath my father 

during the war uh, and, uh, the saddle was ri
ddled by bullets so it couldn't be used 
anymore and he got a new saddle, and so from 
the old saddle, he locally he had a little 
wallet ma de to put his wa r pictures in he
re. And, uh, uh, and it says on there Russia 1915 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252

near Smorngorn, so apparently that's where 
this happened, the incident, and that's all I 
know about that. Except that my father didn't 
get hurt at all. The horse was dead but, and 
the saddle was uh bullet ridden and uh
 but my father didn't get hurt.  
 
Q: O.K. Now you were twelve, 
thirteen years old, we nt to 
Belgium, and you lived with a 
Dutch Jewish fa mily. What 
was thei r fa mily name?  
 

A: Their name  was Leek, L - E - E - K. And the lady was name d, by name  of Wa nda Carr. 
And they were both Jewish and had two child
ren which were already uh grown-ups and I 
lived them a s their little brothe
r and until the war started in 1940.  
 

Q: Did they have to explain your being in
 the family to any of the authorities? 

 

A: No. No. The r e was no problem.  

 

Q: And between December '39 when you arrive d and May '40 when war broke out, what 
was your daily routine?   
 

A: My daily routine was only going to school to
 learn what languages and eventually I also 
had to go and see a rabbi to be bar mitzvah, which I never was, and uh because the war 

started in meantime. The fa mily was not very re
ligious but uh they di
d insist that I take 
lessons to be Bar Mitzvah. Uh, an additiona l th
ing uh which I should not forget is that my 
parents about six months later 
also arrived in Belgium but without papers. They had, they 
were able to get across the border with some guide because we were very near the border 

my father knew a lot of people and some  Chri
stian friends helped him to get across the 
border.  
 

Q: Did you meet up with you 
parents at that point?   
 

A: Yes, my parents came to Belgium in 19, 
uh 39, probably the mi ddle of '3 9, and uh, they 
did not have any money had to leave everythi
ng behind, they just had to wa lk across the 
border. And uh, they were in a refugee status
 in Be lgium and uh, they were furnished a 
little room which was not big enough for me  to
 live with them, but it was agreed by them 
that I would rema in with the Dutch family 
where I was very happy uh and it was a rather 
large family, and, but I wa s able to see my
 parents on weekends. And during the week 
too. And, uh, till of course the war 
came and that's another story.  
 

Q: Let's talk about that. Wh at do you reme mber, starting with __________?  

 

A: O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was consider
ed a political refugee from Ger ma ny. Now 
political refugees from Germany were not
 just Jews but they
 were communists, 
democrats, anybody who had fled Germany becau
se of Hitler. And when the war started, 
the Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested 
everybody that was German, men first, uh, 
mostly me n, in some  cases some  wome n, but
 my  mother and I did not get arrested 
because we were German. My father was a
rrest ed because he was a German and they 
knew that he was Jewish, but these were the 
laws and they arrest
ed everybody that was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
4 
 
German, and put them in internment camps - not concentration camps but internment 
camps in southern France - St. Cyprien, Gurs
, Rivesaltes and there were several others. 
Now at the time  my father was arrested, by th
e police of course, Belgium police, we only 
knew that all these me n were being transported to France because the German advanc e 

came very fast and they had to
 put them some where. At that
 time  we decided, my mother 
and I decided, or rather my mother decided, 
that we should go and look for my father. We  
knew southern France, we  had some  name s, but 
we weren't sure. So we tried to get across 
the border ahead of the German Army into France. At the border, Belgian, at the Belgian-

France, uh Fr ench border, uh we were arrested
 for being Germans. They looked at our ID 

cards, Belgian ID card, which were for forei
gners, and it said of course nationality 
German. We  were arrested by the police at th
e border, trying to cross, and were put in 
prison. Uh, my mother was put in the women's s
ection, and I, for the fi
rst time in my life, 
was in a prison cell, and that
 was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that 
date, of my l i fe, because I was in solitary so
 to say, I was all by my
self in a cell, for 
almost a week. And the Germans bombed the ci
ty. I can't  recall the city right now but it 
was at the border, it was a small town, Vavik 
(ph) was the name  of the city, Vavik (ph). 
And, uh, the wome n's section was served by nun
s and I got to see my mo ther only once 
when she was being walked in the courtyard. 
After a week, or about a week, we were all 
assembled in the courtyard, all, more, more, 
I would think, there were mostly Jews from 

Germany and put on a train under heavy guard 
and sent to southern France to the 
_____________________, which is rather large camp
 which later on became  more 

famous because they put uh the Jews from Bade
n (Ballon)  (ph)  in there and other people. 
It was originally a camp that was cr eated by th
e French to put the remnants of the French, 
of the uh Spanish uh army who wer e  fighting Fr
anco in there when they fled to France 
they were put in there. But most of them
 they were gone by the time we came there. 
There were a few of them left who had not
 been resettled. And we were put in the 
___________________, which in the Pyrenees, in the southern part of France. Uh, then 

the war was over pretty quick which we 
all know, and uh, where to go. There were 
releases everyday people got re
leased. If you had papers to go to some  foreign country, 
the French were glad to get rid of the 
people. The food was terrible there and people 
were, ther e were no killings, ma ss killings or  
anyt hing like that but uh people died fr om 

hunger. If you didn't have any packages comi ng in from the outside there was a good 

chance you would die from hunger there. And 
there is a very large cemetery which I 
visited after the war, and uh, I assume that 
most people are buried 
there. There were no 
crematoriums, uh crematoriums, and uh, so, uh 
the camp itself was very, very bad. It was 

muddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh 
uh and it was just a ma keshift camp. And 
uh so then the time came for some  people to 
leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know 
it was the unoccupied zone of
 France, and uh but the Germans did have some  control 
because Germans did come  there with the French, the Vichy police, or  Vichy governme nt 

officials, uh and uh, ma de sure that uh certain 
people are kept in there, but by that I mean 
probably German communists w
ho were so-called enemies of the German state. Now 
when it came to the women and children, like 
my mother and myself, uh they say can you 
go anyplace. And we decided we would look formy father and it was also at that time  

determined that my fathe r  as in the ____________________ which is on the 

Mediterranean coast. I failed to me ntion that 
the first camp is toward the Atlantic coast, 
one in the Pyrennnes _______ and one is the Bas-
Pyrennes of France, so we said we had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
5 
 
a destination finally; we said we wanted to 
join my father. We  didn't know whether or not 
he was going to be released but he wa s there.  
 
Q: What year is this?  

 

A: I am talking about 1940, late. 
Uh, we traveled to this pla
ce, we found my father, and uh, 
through again some  help of the French, but at 
the time we were all sp
eaking French pretty 
well, uh, we uh, went to a little town called Au
chtafa (ph) in the Pyrenees, near in, uh 
very close to the Spanish border, near 
Pier-pinon (ph) which is the ________ place and 
the people were very helpful, the French in this particular , very small village in the 

mountains and uh who were uh had a lot of vi
neyards and that was their business mostly 
up there. And the French priest who was in anearby parish had a house in this little place 

near the church, and he ma de his house availabl
e to some  Jewish refugees and there were 
about three families living in this house. So my mother and I got refuge there, then we 

went to visit my father and there were visiti
ng hours I think twice a 
week. We  went to see 
my father and, uh, this we nt on for a couple 
of weeks or months, and uh, during one of 
the visits, we  didn't go into the camp - there 
was sort of visiting enclosure with barbed 
wire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or
 so, and during one of the visits when the 
visit was over, and they said
 all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in 
charge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told
 me  where, that I wasn't  going to leave, 
and uh, I say well I came  in, uh, I am already resettled. All he said I am not considered a 

child anymore, I am a man. I was fourteen at 
the time, and uh, I was ke
pt in, just like that. 
They say you stay with your father here, you're
 you're not a child, you're a ma n. So a ll of 
a sudden my  status changed, I was not able to 
go back and stay with my father. Uh - I 
was, uh, among a group of me n, I wa s the youngest one among a group of mostly 

German Jews or also some , one German
 co mmu nist I reme mb
er and one German 
nobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, wa
s fleeing from the Nazis and got caught 
there. And he was later delivered, uh turn
ed over too to the Nazis when they came 
___________. We ll, anyway, he, uh I was in another camp in ______________ and then 

a year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I 
guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the 
rumor ca me  that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps, work camps in 

Germany, a nd uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed 

labor. Uh, in part some  of the people were sh
ipped to labor camps in France. This was not 
a labor camp, this, this was just
, St. Cyprien was just an in
ternment camp, there was no 
work being done there, it was uh on sand, on a sandy beach actually on the 

Mediterranean. And uh, but people,
 people were being continua
lly shipped out in groups 
and to labor camps throughout southern France
. Well, then the word came  that's  not  

completely true, some  people are also being shipped out to Germany, to concentration 

camps. At that time  we were very we ll awar
e of concentration camps and concentration 

contrary to what some  people think that so
me  people say well we didn't know there were 
such concentration camps, I already knew it as 
a child before I went to Belgium, because 
people used to ma ke jokes about Hitler and 
say we ll keep your mouth shut otherwise you 

will go to concentration camp and on the Krista
llnacht, and that is a stor y I mi ssed by the 
way, uh, when Jews were arrest
ed in Germany, uh, my father
 left our home to look after 
his father and was not arrest
ed, and it was just a coinci
dence and uh, his brother was 
arrested and his, uh my mother's brother was 
arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
6 
 
Ca mp. We ll, uh the uh place my fathe r  went to was about twenty miles from where we 
lived and his father lived in the country 
in a home all by himse l f but his younger, my 
father's  younger brother lived with him, and 
he was married to a 
non-Jew. And uh which 
is also an interesting story but I am getti
ng off the subject ther e a little bit. She was 
offered to get a divorce from hi m bec a use he
r brothers were in the Nazi party. And she 
refused. She say, she said will stay with him in
 the bad days, she will st ay with him in the 
good days. And, but he was still living there,
 but his wife had taken refuge some place 
when he was arrested and when my fa
ther came to his father's home, in 
___________________, which is near Muchenglablak (ph), excuse me , they were 

demolishing the house inside. And there were Na
zi storm troopers up there. As my fat her 
walked in and see what was going on, the 
storm troopers were from another city 
apparently, not from the  same  town, ther
e was a common thing that they brought in 

people from outside, there there were no - but
 the Chief of Pol i ce was present, a small 
police force, and it so happened that the Ch
ief of Police had been sitting in uh grammar 
school on the same  bench with my father. A
nd he recognized my father right away. He 
said, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doi
ng here?  Wa s I looking after my father. He 
said, uh, well you're not supposed to be here
. But he said nobody told me  and uh so he 
took him to the police station. He said I 
can't  do but arrest you. I have to uh, anybody 
who shows up has to be arrested, so I have 
to take you police stat
ion to your status. 
BREAK police chiefs and let him see his brothe
r in jail who was la
ter on transported to 
Dachau and uh so knowing that my father had 
the Iron Cross and he had it too, my fat her 
always wore it in mi niature uh form on his 
uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era, 
because he wanted to show that he was as
 good a citizen as anybody 
else, he did his duty 
for his country and so on and so. Uh, and he 
said, well he said we have to do some thing 
for you. I, I don't see where a front-line combat
ant should should be in jail the guy said. 
So he called the local police in Muchenglablak 
and they ordered that my father be sent 
back, but they didn't specify that he be sent 
back under escort or w
ithout escort, so this 
policeman took it on his own to send, to put 
my father on the bus and say when you get 
back to your home town, you report to the poli
ce. He didn't send another policeman with 
him. My father never did. And therefore es
caped arrest and was not arrested during 
Kristallnacht  or the day after.  
 

Q: Let's back up a little bit to talk about 
Kristallnacht. Do you reme mber seeing synagogues 
burning?   
 

A: I don't reme mber seeing synagogue burning but
 I reme mber the synagogue the day or two 
days after, after it was burned, because uh we had to uh, uh, move out of German schools 

into a Jewish school. Uh, and the last school 
I attended, the Jewish school, was right in 
the, in the same  building as the synagogue 
was. So we weren't able to go to school 
anymore. As a matter of fact I received a cer
tificate from my  teacher, uh Jewish teache r, 
only Jews were taught by Jews, and it said in 
there this letter is in
stead of certificate 
because the certificate was destroyed by fire
, which was the fire in the syna gogue, and 
uh, this ma n by the way is still living in New York, my old head teacher from the Jewish 

school and he  is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him. And he saved his life 

by being hidden by two Christian fa milies in the same  town, Muchenglablak. He survived 

the war in Much.. and came to Ne w York afte
r the war. He had no children. Extremely 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
7 
 
unusual, extremely unusual. But I uh believe, I 
am not sure, that he, the people that hid 
him were fellow teachers. And the wome n dyed 
their hair bl onde, to survive the war.  
 
Q: The synagogue was totally destroyed?   

 

A: The synagogue was totally destroyed. Uh, ther
e was an incident - th
e city, uh the Jewish 
community was apparently well liked and the anti-Semitism was not as bad as it mi ght 

have been in some other German cities. And uh the police was sort of decent and didn't , 

of course the Nazis weren't and the storm tr
oopers weren't and the SS weren't, uh, but the 
police were sort of decent because  they re
spected the community. But there were some  

bad ones too, but in general, the police saw to 
it that not too people 
were bodily harme d.  
 

Q: Do you remember other buildings 
that were destroyed as well?   
 

A: Yes, the rabbi's house was, the, the, he 
lived in an apartment house. The furniture was 
thrown out through the window and we went 
by there on the way to school. And there 
was a piano on, on the sidewalk, sma shed 
and other things, many other things. I 
reme mber that. And there were other home s which I didn't see of course where they 

threw things out into the stre
et. And the stores of course. 
Since we had one ma in street 
there where there were a lot of stores, that wa
s also street very close to our school and we 
walked through there many times and all the Je
wi sh stores had their windows s mashed.  
 

Q: What had been your father's  occupation?   

 

A: My father was uh, as a representative for a 
silk tie factory in Krayfeld (ph) and uh, which 
is another town which is a silk capital, was th
e silk capital of Germany, a nd he worked as 
a representative for, for this company. That was his occupation.  
 

Q: Did he have hi
s own business?   
 

A: Not his own business, no.  

 

Q: O.K. Now when you were at the camp, 
went with your mother. (end of Tape)  

 

A: .... no way, and uh to continue the stor
y about that partic
ular camp, _______________-, 
when these rumors I started talking about 
came that people are transported to Germany, 
or to Poland ma ybe to labor 
camps, uh, my father felt we had 
to get out and the fact that 
uh we both spoke French pretty well there we
re occasionally Fr ench gendarmes - these 
were our guards who were at the uh the 
camp wa s surrounded by barbed wire and when 
these people did guard duty, some  of them 
were sympathetic and every once in a while 
some body would throw me  a piece of bread. They  came, there was one particular French 

gendarme who uh, whenever he was on duty I, he
 had some thing for me . He threw it over 
the fence, and I asked him one day if he hear
d that people are being 
transported. He says 
yes, if you can get out, get out. When he said
 if you can get out, get 
out, I thought he is 
insinuating to me  that with him I have a ch
ance to get out through the barbed wire under 
the fence when he is on guard duty, and that 
is exactly what happened. Both my father 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
8 
 
and I escaped when this ma n was on duty - 
he turned around, he walked away like he 
didn't see it, this was at night. And we went 
to the village where my mother lived, and uh 

with the O.K. of the priest and with th
e O.K. of the ma yor, who happened to be a 

communist, of that city, the ma yor and the 
Catholic priest worked hand in hand, an 
unusual team, but at the time they thought th
ey were fighting the Germans and I don't 
know ______ but I suspect that the ma yor was a me mber of the __________. He was 

very anti-Germa n and he tried to help. And 
by helping I mean that we had shelter from 
the priest. And he issued a phoney ID card. This was a real ID card but the number of the 

ID card was not registered at City Hall, a
nd he took a big chance. Nothing happened to 

him that I know, but we were arrested late
r on based on that ID card, when Vichy police 
came under the guide of the Nazis, they raided
 places, they were looking for people, and I 
mean, also in addition they picked whoeve
r else they could, particularly Jews. And 
during one of those checks, and we, I don't know 
to this date whether we were turned in 
by some body, or the ma yor was turned in by 
some body or the priest was turned in by 
some body. Uh, they also _______________, I know that
. But some body must have told 
some thing, must have spoke some thing, ei
ther wa s unhappy about us or unhappy about 
the ma yor or whatever wa s going on there. And 
uh so one day during a raid, we were all 
arrested and then we were shipped off a
nd they compared the uh, uh IDs with what 

records were at City Hall and they found out
 they were phoney ID car
ds. And that is how 
we got caught. From there on we were sent in
 by train to Drancy, which is the big camp 
near Paris which was a collection camp for Jews  from all over France. And uh after the 

war I found out what transport number I was i
n. Of course I didn't know at that time , 
nobody was telling anything. We  stayed several 
days in Drancy, (cough) excuse me , and 
not knowing what our destination was and this
 wa s my father, mother and myself, plus 
the other Jewish fa milies who were
 arrest ed in that little to
wn in the south of France, uh, 
it was on 12th September, uh, 1942, that our 
transport was put together and these 
transport usually a thousand people, uh cattle ca
rs, going out of Drancy, 
near Paris, to the 
east. There were rumors where we were going, 
but not rumors that we were going to be 
gassed or anything rumors of labor camps a
nd so on. Uh, the transport that I me ntioned 
and the date I found that af
ter war because uh there is a book which was ma de uh, uh, 

published with the help of the French governme
nt and I think the Krazfelds (ph) had the 
hand in it and I have the book and in th
is book is my na me , my parents, name , 
nationality, date of births, and 
the people that I wa s with on ou
r transport, and from then I 
found after the war that our transport was 
transport number 31 out of Drancy, and I 
understand there total of 75,000 peopl
e involved in transports out
 of Paris, out of Drancy, 
and, like I say, we were transport number 
31 and that transport left on the 12th of 
September, 1942 for Germany.  
 

Q: Tell us a little bit about the trip.  

 

A: Excuse me . The cattle cars were packed w
ith people. There wa s very little food, what 
people had on them, and the only thing thatI can reme mber that were given during the 

trip, on the trip towards Auschwitz, which I di
dn't  know at the time but I found out later, 
uh, was water. We  were guarded by uh Germans and in some  places where we stopped-

they had to get also food, we were given so
me  water and uh, were able to empty buckets 
we used as toilets. But there was hardly space for everyone to lie down. Some  people had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
9 
 
to sit up all night, people were
 packed in like sardines, several people died, some  people 
committed suicide. In my particular car, a 
lady doctor gave bi rth to her own baby. And 
the child of course didn't survive; I don't 
know if she did. Uh. There was a most unusual 
event in my cattle car. Uh, being from Ger ma
ny, my father was able to read through the 
cracks of the wood some  of th
e station name s that we went through, so we definitely 
knew that we were going to upper Sa lezia, which is now Poland, and which is near 

Breslau, what used to be the German city of
 Breslau, and where most of the concentration 
camps that we found out after the war were lo
cated, including Auschwitz, and a lot of the 
subcamps. Uh, the cars were opened at statio
ns every once in a while and people were 
beaten up me rcilessly and outside of that, pe
ople were starving. 
Uh, people didn't have 
any food, didn't bring anything along. Some
 people stuffed their pockets full of 
some thing and they ate it, but I don't reme mb
er ever having been given any food except 
that we were given water and in some  cases pe
ople weren't even given water. So that a lot 
of people arrived dead or st
arved or whatever. Uh, on the way to Auschwitz, and again, I 
didn't know the destination at that time, at one
 station in, uh, I can't  recall the name right 
now, in upper Salezia, a small station, the door
s were opened, and they said all me n out. 
That was the order. All me n, working me n that
 were able to work, out. Uh, like I said, 
this was not arrival at Ausc
hwitz or any other camp, but it 
was just a small station, and 
uh, at that time I had to ma ke a decision. 
In the meanti me  I was going on 16, and I was 
pretty strong because I ha d worked that summ
er in the French vineyards to ma ke some 
money. And it was hard work so I had pretty 
strong muscles and uh it wa
sn't  just that but 
uh uh the decision I had to ma ke whe t her I wa
s a child staying with the wo me n or me n. I 

wanted to stay with my father. And I came 
out and we didn't know at that time what it 
meant. Wor k meant able to su
rvive. To live. And, but we didn't  know what it meant for 
my mother and from that transport number
 31, according to the,
 this book from the 
French governme nt, of, of the thousand people or
 so, I think there are six survivors. They 
determined after the war. So all the women and children went straight  into the gas 

chamber. At that point I sear
ched for my mother after th
e war, and I wound up with the 
German Red Cross, or Inte
rnational Red Cross, at _______ 
and they had a listing saying 
that all the women and children went straight  in
to the gas chamber, of 
that transport. So I 
assume  that my mother was gassed right 
away on arriva l at  Auschwitz which was 
some ti me s in September 1942. Uh, the decision I 
ma de to stay with my father was my  
lucky decision, and again, uh, ma ybe there was 
at the time a feeling if you worked, you 
can survive. And we didn't know, we  thought 
ma ybe the wome n are also going to be put 
to work in factories or whatever. But I didn'
t know the gas chamber would be at the other 
end. Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother 
until after the war, and I se arched for my 
mother in Brussels, Belgium, and in Muche
nglablak, and various other places but I didn't 
find her, until I was determined that she actually
 did perish. Uh, my fa
ther and I were sent 
from that place in trucks to a small camp
 which was a subcamp of Auschwitz and in 
those days these small subcamps we re called ______________________ 

_______________________________, which me ans forced labor camp of the Chief of 

the German Police and the Vice Furhur of 
the SS which was Hi mmler of course. They 
had large name s but they were small con
centration camps in other words, under the 
control of the SS. Not always guarded by SS but some ti me s by storm troopers, some time s 

by soldiers, or helper s fro m the east which were
 in some  case Ukrainians, or Polish guys, 

and frankly from my experience, I preferred 
the German sol diers who were guarded to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
10 
 
some  of the other people who 
tried to prove they were bett
er than the Germans and didn't 
like the Jews and were very uh sadistic some time s. I'm not saying that the Germans or  the 
Nazis were not sadistic
 but the uh first experience we ha
ve from these guards were the 
horribl e experience and uh I always felt that 
I was ma ybe mo re German than they were. 
They called, so-called people who lived in 
the territori es. They were sometimes Polish, 
some ti me s German, in upper Salezia, and at th
at time they had opted to be German a nd 
some  of the people didn't speak German that 
well. Their Polish was a lot better. And uh, 
the uh, experience we had, the 
initial experience was not very
 good. Of course, the initial 
experience was the roughest expe
rience under the circumstances.  
 

Q: Why don't  you talk about that.  

 

A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger camp, we were in two smaller camps and each camp was, I 
don't re me mber exactly the, I would say less th
an a thousand people. I 
think in one case it 
was six hundred and the other one ma y have 
been a thousand. One was the camp of Lazy 
- L - A - Z - Y, which was ma inly for the c
onstruction or reconstr
uction of bombed-out 
railways. And we went out everyday to the,
 uh, we  be ma rched under guard, to the sites 
where the railways had been bombed by theRussians I suppose. In those days I don't 

think the Americans were comi ng out that  far. And they bombed two transports, 

whatever, and also building new railways, wh
ich was the hardest work because people 
were not strong and the food was very limited 
and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death 
on the job or in the camp . And the system wa
s at that time whenever they needed more 
labor, new people were comi ng 
and being fed into the camp. Supposed they had in the 
camp of a thousand people, they had a hundred
 people who died during a week or two on 
the job. We ll, they got a hundred mo re from a 
transport or from Auschwitz or wherever 
they got them from to be sent in to fill 
up the void. And uh, so we were also digging up 
unexploded bombs which, and, and this I did tw
ice during my concentration camp career, 
uh, which was very dangerous of course and 
the German gua rd would stay pretty far 
away in case some thing exploded. And some  pe
ople did get killed that way. Uh, but, uh, 
railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people 

were not strong enough to lift up the rails, 
and uh, some  people got crushed under the 
rails, and people fell down. Our clothing 
was uh, uh, limited. In the wintertime we had 
clogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue
/white stripped uniforms. In the beginning 
we had our own with the Star of David on 
it. Later on we got the bl ue/white-striped 
uniforms. Uh, but it was very, we weren't 
properly dressed, we  didn't have the proper 
food, and people were just uh walking skeletons
 in a lot of cases. And a lot of people 

committed suicide. This was the most, the mo
st vivid recalling I can do about the camps, 
is not people being killed but people committing 
suicide. Particular ly in one camp that I 
am comi ng t o later on which was the last
 camp. Uh, but nobody thought they were going 
to survive. Uh, the first camp, 
uh, was like I said
 most railroad and then later on we were 
sent to another camp and I don't know if th
e first camp was done away with, but the 
whole camp was transferred. We  went to 
another camp and uh, when we worked on 
construction of bunkers and buildings for the 
Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume  
was producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any 

non-military projects. They were all always in 
support of the military. So we worked near 
the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory. Uh and I was lu
cky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
11 
 
that I was able to speak German. I had an
 advantage over the other Jews who were 
comi ng from Poland, who didn't speak Germ
an unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh, 
Yiddish to some  unfortunately, to some  of 
the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red, 
uh, red drape or some thing in front of because that showed he 's Jewish. And if you'r e able 

to speak German, correct German, you got some
times less beatings, or you were also able 
on the job to execute an 
order right away. You unde
rstand the order was given 
imme diately. And that was very important. Some
 people picked it up pretty fast. Some  of 
the other people, if they cam
e from France, I'm not just 
saying uh Polish Jews, but the 
Jews from other countries, a
nd in the first camps we were 
all Jews which changed later 
on through mi x. Uh, and uh, if you were able to
 speak German and follow orders you got 
less beatings, you were able to do it right aw
ay, and if you had a team, uh, some ti me s we 
had to work in teams uh loading lorries (ph) and we were two people 
or four people as a 
team and all of them spoke German. We trie
d to team up that way or working that way 
because it always worked better than shouting 
one, two, three or some thing like that in 
German. And the Germans, being very militari stic, and fr ankly there is some thing I 

forgot. I was grew up that way, 
to be almost like a, like a Pr ussian. My father was very 
great disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, 
I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped, 

and so on and so on. It wa sn't  like our kids
 are today. And, but it helped me  later on, 

being able to jump when the Nazis said
 to jump , you know, and to do things and 
understanding what they meant and doing it so
rt of a little bit of a military way. Uh, 
which I understand from uh, from other people th
at I swapped stories with after the wa r, 
it is true in ma ny cases. If, if you knew the Ge
rman language it definitely helped. And in 
some  case, uh, uh, when we were building bunkers you had to read the diagram, how t o, 

into uh concrete, solid concre
te you have to put uh wiring an
d uh wiring has to be wired 
up a certain way that the designs, if it is r
ounded and so on, and it ha
s to be tight with uh, 
with uh the wire, the smaller wi
re, and if you're able to r
ead the diagram from Ger ma n, 
your job was much easier. You didn't ma ke 
any mi stakes. And so on, so that helped. 
Anyway, the camps, the second camp I went t
o, I ma de by fi rst great friend for life, uh 
although I still di d have my father with me
, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew 
and I also forgot to me ntion since I lived 
with a Dutch Jewish fa mily in Brussels, 
Belgium, I also picked up Dutch, which was 
spoken at home, but Dutch and Flemish is 
almost the same . And so I was very fluent in
 Dutch by that time , and I picked, uh, or he 

picked me , I picked him, uh, uh, a young ma n my
 age whose father and brother-in-law 

was also in the same  camp. So we t eamed 
up. We were about the same  height, and the 

same  age, and we teame d up, became very good friends and since uh he came  with a 

group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the camp, an
d it is a sad experience to tell about the 
Dutch Jews. Because Holland was a country wh
ere people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of 
butter, all the rich th
ings, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying 
like flies. All of a sudden no 
food at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short, 

the shortest period of time , there were very 
few left. I don't, I think we did receive one 
time a group of two hundred Jews and within 
a ma tter of six weeks 
they were down to 
maybe fifty or less. I don't know exa ctl
y. Because uh, it was much harder on them, 
whereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Je
w fami ly who had always had a hard life, 
where lived in a ghetto ma ybe and who was poor
, and didn't have all the rich foods, he 
was able to resist much better 
in a concentrate, fo
r a longer period of tim
e. In the end it 
was all the same . But uh, uh, that was a big 
difference with a Jew from the We st and a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
12 
 
Jew from the East - the survival rate. 
Uh, a Jew from Poland was toughened up, or a 
Russian Jew or whoever they had from the, th
e eastern Europe. So in that respect I think, 
uh, there was greater survival 
rate among the eastern European Jews than the western 
European Jews. But the Dutch Jews were partic
ularly badly hit because of their life style 
that they had before. So I teamed up with this
 boy. At the time proba
bly more so than his 
fa mily, his father and his brothe
r-in-law were killed in the ca
mp, and I must tell this story 
because Mike  Swab (ph) was his name, my be
st fr iend, Mike , who unfortunately di ed in 
Holland two years ago of cancer, and we were 
the best of friends. As a ma tter of fac t  
we'r e like brothers. And uh, Mike Swab's fath
er and brother were 
killed by cold water 
shower. The team was, came back fr om work
 one day where there were a lot of Dutch 
Jews and they were lined up in the camp str
eet, and they had said
 that they did not 
perform their job properly. They were sabotag
ing the German war effort, the Dutch Jews. 
And they took all these Jews who were in that 
particular group that came  back from work 
and hosed them down - they call it hosing dow
n. By that they took a fire hose in the 
mi ddle of the winter, and this must have 
been 1942, to 43 the wi
nter, and uh hosed the 
people the people had to stand at 
attention and they actually fr oze to death. This is, this is 
a winter not like here but 
uh a Polish winter you are ta
lking about now. A eastern 
European winter, with snow on the ground, 
leaving people outside all night and by 
morning mo st of them were frozen to death.And that was the end of Mike Swab's father 

and brother-in-law. So from then on, we just
 became brothers and uh my father was of 
course still alive but uh, we then teamed up 
as a team and, at work, Mike knew Ger man 
quite well, because first of all Dutch and Germ
an is very close and he picked it up very 
fast; he knew some  before. Mike came  from a 
rather large family and all of his fami ly 
was wiped out. This is another story for after the war. But uh, we could not have been 

closer because in everythi ng we just ticked, 
we just, he had the same  ideas about how to 

survive and our ma in idea was to be able 
to escape. And I said here I have some body 
who's, maybe my father won't be able to ma
ke it. I knew at that time  he was getting 
weaker but he was pretty good at
 that time . So I  said if we'r e going to ma ke it, the young 
people are going to ma ke it and uh, we then 
decided, in actual words I think you could 
almost say we made a pact, that we'r e going to
 stick it out together. We  talked about it 
and then said we just have to help each 
other the best way we 
can. If you find some  food, 
you share it with me . I fi nd some  extra food, I sh
are it with you and it has to be complete 
honesty and none, none of this taking away 
from the cabin. Many tim
es it feels people 
come  like beasts some time s when they 
are hungry, and uh, become  dehuma nized. And 
we'r e not become , we'r e not going to become
 dehumanized. We 'r e going to rema in the 

way we came as much as possible and we'r e 
going to get out. Never to leave that idea 
behind that we'r e not going to ma ke it. We  
are going to ma ke it. And uh, that was the 
singlest biggest thing inmy life, I'm sure his life, that uh, 
that made me so live, plus a lot 
of luck, plus a lot of faith, pl
us a lot of other things. But I 
think that the, think the idea  
that uh, we'r e going to ma ke it by escaping or 
some  other way, uh, ma de us stay alive. 

Now, Mike Swab then uh moved for t unately 
for me  and for him I think, that when we 
move from c a mp to ca mp we always stick 
together. His number, 
uh that was tattooed on 
his arm was just a few away from me and whic
h was given to us later, not in the first 
camps but when we moved to the subcam
p of Aus c hwitz. And uh, we uh, the bond was 
even stronger because I felt also that he had lo
st
 hi s father, on my part at least, he doesn't  
have a father or brother, he is all by hims
elf, and I still have my father. Although my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
13 
 
father did work in a di fferent pl ace, but at
 ni ghttime we saw each other in the barracks. 
And we were also able to help each other ou
t by uh, for instance in this pa rticular case, I 
had to hold the measuring equipment for a 
Germa n _______ which is a, a surveyor of uh, 
uh, on a, a construction site, 
on a railroad site, you had 
what these guys they call 
mi ster______ ,or ________, which is a supervis
or and sometimes, because I spoke 
German, he left a piece of bread or some thi
ng. And then I would take
 it back and share it 
with my friend Mike and my father or some th
ing. But there wa s a little help every once in 

a while if you were lucky and if you were ma
ybe away from the big group which I was at 
times. And uh, when we were transferred to the other camp, with Mike Swab, of course, 

we teamed up, uh, filling lorries (ph) , and they have a name  for that, auch ____________, 

which I don't know if there is a name  in 
English, means in working, you fill your lorry 
and then if the others are finished, you can re
st up. In other words,you don't  have to fill 
another lorry (ph) becaus e there are two peopl
e to each lorry. You throw the dirt in, and 
then ______ some  other place, and you unload it, and you fill holes and so on. Or bunk 

craters or whatever we did there (mumbl
ed). And uh, uh Mike and I were probably 
among the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was 

ciga - one cigarette a day. These were Russi
an ma horka (ph) cigarettes which had been 
either captured or gotten from the Soviet Unio
n; they weren't real tobacco, but to the 
smoker this was better than nothing. And there 
were people in the camps who would give 
their bread away instead of ( m
umble) rather not eat than sm
oke a cigarette. And that's 
how we traded. There wa s a trade going on among the people who were smokers and 

who rather would die smoking, not from cancer
 but from not  eati
ng, and would give a 
piece of their bread away just to ha ve  a .... TA
PE ENDS ... t hat they, be cause they we re's  
always the same , whether he was a uh, uh, a bad or good, shouldn't say good guy because 

there weren't many good guys, most of them 
were bad, but occasionally there was one 
who probably had regrets having joined the 
SS or, and we had one who actually spoke 
Yiddish, who apparently had lived with Jews
. Some  people suspected him ma ybe partly 
Jewish, but we never determined that and 
he disappeared later on. Maybe he was found 
out, but uh he did speak Yiddish. And uh, uh, it 
was also question of survival who your 
guard was that particular day. So if you 
were lucky ma ybe for ma ny weeks you had the 
right guard. Some body came along he just hated 
you for being able to speak German a s  
well as he did. Or ma ybe better. If he 
was a guard who came from some territory 
________ which are the uh, uh - I can't think of 
name right now - ethnic Germans, who 
were transported back into Germany, came fr
om the Sudanan (ph) land. And some  of 
these people did not speak so well German, so here you have a guard whose German was 

not so good, but a prisoner, a Jew, spoke bett
er Ge rman than he did. And that was of 
course cause for taking it out on somebody, a
nd, and that was very frequent, very 
frequent. But it didn't have to be the la
nguage, there were ma ny other things this 
happened to. Pause. Uh, in the uh, digging up of bombs, uh, we were all so lucky. I'm 

speaking very frequently about luck because 
uh, the survival is part the luck, staying 

healthy and a, a number of other things. But the 
luck part was that in my t eam, this again 
I'm talking about teams (mumbled) in somepl
ace you were work as team, a team of five 
people there were digging up bombs. We  ha
d an _______ form (ph) engineer, a Jew who 
knew how to defuse bombs, who learned it appa
rently in there, and in ot her teams which 
just had to be some body in the team of five 
people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the 
bomb and some  of the m went off. So our cas
e in a team that dug up 
the bombs, we had an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
14 
 
engineer that knew what he was doing and 
we never had an explosion. So again, luck. 
And uh, uh, what can, else can I contribute to, 
faith. Yes, I'll speak about that now. Uh, I 
came from a Jewish fami ly which went to
 the synagogue on holidays, and on Sabbath 
evening, but not orthodox. We  had a conser
vative synagogue in our town, the only one, 
and it was a city of about 800 Jews I believe
. Middle class mo stly, and uh, uh, I'm getting 
off the subject.  
 
Q: MUMBLED -  

 

A: Thank you. Things I think of I want to sa
y, not about faith, but 
uh about how I me t my 
wife later on. Uh, I ma rried a, I ma rried 
a non-Jewish woma n, a German, but she come s 
from a nonªNazi family. I, I, ________ her unc
le was the uh, president of the German 
Jewish Friendship Society, he was a former Ge
r man professor, and he was the Senator for 
Cultural (ph) Education in We st Berlin. Uh a
nd, uh, so I, I knew this when I me t her, and 
wanted to marry some body as a friend of 
my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's  son, who 
ma rried a woma n who c o me s from a  big Nazi family, and the fa mily didn't  even want to 

have anything to do with them. But uh, uh, my wi
fe wanted to become  Jewish. I said for 
_______ you believe whatever you want to believe
. That's the way I do. I'm not sure I 
believe everything that the Jew does - I believe 
what I want - that's the way I came out of 
the camps. And, uh, but my wife 
said _____________________ but my children are 
educated as Jews, but according to the law, 
they are not Jewish and I know that because 

their mother has to be Jewish. And to me  th
is means absolutely nothing. My children feel 
as Jews, they'r e educated, they go to synagogue, 
some  of them, not all. Li ke all the other 
Jewish kids too. But uh, they 
went to Jewish Sunday School for ten years, every one of 
them. They are always the top ones in their 
class, and so I have, don't have a problem 
with it. To me , conversion means nothing. I 
have seen so ma ny people being converted 
by militant  chap__ that di dn't deserve to be conve
rted. Just  because, for the in-laws, or ...  
 

Q: You were talking before a
bout how your faith helped you.  
 

A: Right. We 'r e not on yet. We are on. Oh, I 
didn't know that, I didn't realize that. O.K. 
Anyway, I started talking about my faith. No
w, I me ntioned that I, uh, we belonged to 
conservative synagogue which was the only one 
in the town where we lived. And we had 
an outstanding rabbi there. Wa s quite impressive ma n. And so I had a good Jewish 

education. In Germany, in the, in the public 
school, you also get le
ssons of religion, and 
so the Jews are, just like here you may ha
ve to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you 
don't do it in a public school, you go outside to 
your church to get 
religious lessons. But 
in Germany, it's part of the curriculum that
 once or twice or three time s a week you have 
an hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or what
ever. And so uh, I grew up, to ma ke a long 
story short, to be with a solid Jewish 
education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not, 
neither was my father, very religious. My gr
andparents were, on one side. And uh, so, my 

faith, that I want to talk about
, I lost towards the end of th
e war, my faith in God. I say 
how can there be a God, and I was not thinking 
about myself, or this was even before my 
father was killed. Uh, I lost my faith because
 I say how can God allo
w that little children 
and wome n be killed. And uh, I kept this for ab
out a year after the war. And then I felt I 
came back not because some body tried to convince me  there is a god, all by myself I said 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
15 
 
there has to be something superior , but I will  neve r call him almi ghty again, because if he 
was almi ghty, he could have prevented that. 
So I don't believe that God is almi ghty. I do 

believe in architect of the universe, call hi
m God, call him what you 
will, I do believe in 

God. But, uh, and my c hildren believe in God. Uh, and I, these questions I have talked 

extensively, uh, to my children about and I told
 them they are free to believe whatever 

they want to. They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't  point this out 

before, why I wanted to be Jewish and that
 was a question that uh, came up with, between 
me  and my wife before we got ma rried. 
I said, look, you are pr
otestant and uh, I'm 
Jewish. Now, I am not very strong on Judaism,
 but the children, we have to decide when 
we have children, what they will be. So, I sa
id whatever you want them to be is alright 
with me, and she said, I said, I don't feel eith
er wa y. So I decided the children would be 
Jewish with the agreeme nt of my wife, for one
 reason only. In the me mor y of my parents, 
because my parents ha d to die because they were Jews, and, in their me mory, the children 

are going to be Jewish. If it ha
d to be one way or another, 
it had to be some  reason why 
they'r e one way or another. So my wife fully
 agreed. And my wife, after several years, 
wanted also to become Jewish, and I said th
is means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper. 
You'll continue living just the way we  do 
now - it means nothing. 
And as far as the 
children, they can feel, they grew up with 
ten years of Jewish education and know all 
there is to know, and they can do whatever 
they want. And, uh, I give them that freedom, 

because I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do be lieve  in God and it came 

back to me  after the war. B
ecause I really had a hard tim
e for a long time, and while I 
was in the U.S. Ar my I had a very deep uh, 
talk with a Catholic
 chaplain. And, about 
faith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he 

had experienced some  of the things, we 
had ma ny evenings together, that he had 
experienced some  of the things 
that I talked to him about, th
at he wasn't  sure he could 
still believe in God. And that come s from a Ca
tholic priest in the Army. Anyway, that's, I 
me ntioned religion. Uh, if relig
ion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion, 
one or another religion, as long as you have 
some  belief in some thing, in God, or in your 
fellow ma n. To me , I look at my parents as
 being godly. They were good people, they 
died, they had never done anything wrong, and 
to me  that, I see God in them. And I can 
see God in other people, live people. They are good people. I 
see God in nature. So I can 
consider myself as believing in God, although at
, for, for a while, for me  about two years, 
I didn't believe in God. This was one year after 
the war. Uh, the belief
 to survive I talked 
about. O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. One was luck. Health wa s of utmost  
importance. Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive. 

Because there were so ma ny diseases. There was typhus in pl aces. Diarrhe 
 

A: The worst enemy that I, that I have seen. 
Once you had it, you coul
dn't get rid of it. And, 
fortunately, in some  of t hese camps, and I 
am getting back to the story later on more 
extensively, you had ma ny Jewish doctors, w
ho weren't allowed to practice me dicine. 

There was no hospital, but who recommended cer
tain ways of keeping yourself fit, even 
without, with little food. For instance, in 
the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was 
burned and ground it up and ate th
e ashes, uh, the coal actuall
y. The coal, and that is one 
thing that will help you in preventing diarrh
ea, or if you have diarrhea ma ybe you can get 
rid of it. So fr om coal. So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even 

chewing on a piece of wood. Just to kill the 
feeling of hunger. So, and, and, and like I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
16 
 
said the doctors were very helpful in thos
e camps, even though they weren't allowed to 
practice, with that advice. And uh, so, uh, dis
ease was the big killer 
and if you were able 
to survive that you were lucky. Now uh, while 
I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped 
later on, my weight, I was uh put on the scal
e by the U.S. Ar my and was seventy-five 
pounds. I was a walking skeleton, but I was healt
hy. And that was my luck. Uh, just skin 
and bones, but walking and still fairly st
rong, and weighed seve
nty-five American 
pounds. And so was my friend Mike Schwab a
bout the same . And we picked it up, about 
fifty pounds in six months, in three months
. I'm sorry. But uh, from the smaller camps 
that I was talking about, we went to a la
rger camp which was called Blechhammer (ph) 
and this was an actual small concentration 
camp of about four thousand people. Whe n I 
say concentration camp I  must ma ke the 
difference between a camp like Auschwitz, and 
this was a subcamp of Auschwitz. Auschw
itz had some thing like I believe ma ybe a 
hundred subcamps, some smaller, some  bigger,
 and this one four thousand people. And 
these subcamps were mainly used not for the 
destruction of people but for work people to 
death. That was the point in those camps. They
 were used for the German war effort in 
most cases. In this particular case, Blechhamm
er (ph) was a camp that was about I think 
maybe a hundred kilometers from Auschwitz
, ma ybe less, I don't know e xactly. And it 
had the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and 

everyday we went to work in this factory. No
w, the, the factory, the gasoline factory wa s 
being bombed once by American long-range bomb
ers. And I must as a side-line st ate 

some thing. I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers 

about the bombing of Auschwitz, that it couldn'
t be done. It wa s too far. Well, we were 
just, I would say within fi fty miles of
 Auschwitz. And we were being bombed by 
American bombers, which was some thing 
happy event for us although some  prisoners 
got killed, and in the factory, where we di
d also mostly construction work. We  didn't  
actually participat e in the operation of th
e factory. These were Germans or other 
foreigners. And they had also British pr
isoner of war camp nearby. Uh, the uh, uh, we 

were ma inly used to clean up from the bombings. We  built and built ne w bunkers where 

the Germans could hide. Now when t he bombers came overhead, there were several 

bombing raids who dropped what they call, 
uh carpet bombings. That
 me ans releasing, a 
hundred planes releasing all the 
bombs at one time  for effe ct. And they tried to destroy 
the factory in order to prevent the Germans fr
om having gasoline to 
continue the war. Uh, 
the camp wa s, like I said, a work camp and not a camp with gas chambers. The people, 

and I didn't know this at the time , only when they came to my father which I'm going to 

talk about in a mi nute, the people were not dest royed in gas chambers there because that 

was done at Auschwitz. And we were there 
for one purpose, to work. We  worked to 
death. The food was so so but compa r ed to
 the previous camp it 
was a little better 
because they really needed us very badl
y there. But there was uh, one me al in the 

morning and one meal at night. And if you'r e 
lucky, there was some  soup a t  lunch time at 
the place of work. And working hours were us
ually, and this was true for most of the 
camps, were anywhere from ten to twelve
 hours average day. A
nd the facilities for 
hygiene were very poor. I didn't touch on that 
in the camps, and the common latrines and 

the people had diarrhea like I me ntioned be
fore and uh, and people would catch bugs one 
from one another. The wa ter was some place on, the cold water. And anyway, the 

Blechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of
 the more modern or well-kept camps 
because the camp commander and the Je
w __________ which was the uh Jewish guy in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
17 
 
charge. One of the prisoners was not a copple 
(ph) which was so bad, but he was also wa s 
a winner of a German medal during the Firs
t World Wa r and was some what respected by 
the SS. And he was a learned ma n and his name  was Klempe r, Kempor or Kemora (ph) 
was his name. And because of him I think uh, uh 
a lot of people, not 
a lot of people, but 
the, the lifestyle was some what more decen
t than in other places. Uh, we were not 
bothered too much while we were in th
e camp. We had to work. Uh, people were 
some ti me s beaten to death. It was up to the lo
cal SS who guarded us. Or even to some  of 

the German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were some ti me s pretty bad guys who knew 

that it doesn't  matter. You kill one prisoner 
they got repl aceme nt ones pretty quick. Now 
at Blechhammer, it was a replacement, uh, uh, 
the replacement worked this way. If a 
hundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hund
red prisoners had died over a period of 
time, a short period of time , two or thr
ee hundred prisoners would come  in from 

Auschwitz immediately, which wasn't very far 
away. So they could work people to death 
and then the bodies, I don't even know what th
ey did with the bodies, whether they were 
taken to a crematorium i n Auschwitz or not or
 whether they were ta
ken care of locally. I 
really don't know that. But whenever there were prisoners mi ssing, they just brought a 

couple hundred more. And this was true also 
in the last camp. Uh, exactly the same  
me thod of re plenishment. Uh, with my father
 in, this happened in about uh, I don't know 
exactly but uh, Nove mb er or so of 1944. My 
father became very weak. Uh, was also like 

a skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. He was going to have, and uh, at that 

time there was unwritten rule, and I've check
ed it out after the war, this, there was 
someplace there was something in writi
ng, and some place there was nothing, I don't 

know the ____ it was ____, but it was an accepted 
fact that any Jew or any worker, non-
Jewish, who worked in these labor camps,
 uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good 
enough for the war effort of Ger many. Therefore,
 he was disposed of. Disposal meant gas 
chamber if they have one. In our case Ausc
hwitz was nearby. So what they did ever once 
in a while, they picked up the people. Some
 people said I can't , I'm weak. Well the SS 
picked them out or they picked out older 
people. But there was always a group of people 
that was sent back from Blechhammer to 
Auschwitz by truck. But whoever reached the 
age of was automa tically put in that group, to be
 disposed of. Well, what they said just for 
fun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard. They 

needed to rest. But what it r
eally meant and we knew that not officially but the rumor s 
were they wa s being sent to Auschwitz to 
the gas chamber. And that is exactly what 
happened to my father. I came back from work 
one day. My father wasn't  there and didn't 
come  back, and I was, where is my father, tryi
ng to find out frantically. Well, he was in a 
special enclosure within the camp, a barbed wi
re enclosure with one barracks where they 
assembled those people. They referred to it as the dispensary but it 
wasn't a dispensary - 
it was just a gob of people and sent them a way
 in a couple of days or whatever. We ll, I 

saw my father one more time through the barb
ed wire and it was 
nothing I could do and 
nothing he could do. And I could only hope for th
e best, not wanting to
 be true it is the 
gas chamber at the other end, but it was. And 
so I know the exact fate of my father. Uh, 
he was taken from Blechhammer to Auschwitz
 and gassed and disposed of. And, whic h 
also happened to be the fate of my father
, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already. And uh, 
so when I was alone, I still ha d by fr iend Mike
 Swab, which was some thing great to ha ve, 
to have uh some body to lean on and he can le
an on you. And we decided from then more 
than ever that the first chance we get we'r e 
going to escape. And we wor ked together, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
18 
 
it was almost impossible. The, the concentr
ation camp had ve ry high walls. They were 
ma de from c oncrete slabs, and on top of the wa
ll of this particular camp was electrical ly 
loaded barbed wire. There was no way to get out. And it was well controlled with guard 
towers. And being ma rched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no 

way to escape either. Ther
e were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each side. The 
only place where it would have been possibl
e to escape was at the work site. If you 
worked in a separate group lik
e I did, I did sometimes. But 
when I worked in a separate 
group, Mike Swab didn't  work in a separate group
. And our plane, plan was that if we can 
escape it should be in a group. Some  of us mi ght 
be shot in the proce
ss of escaping, if it is 
found out, but some  of us mi ght get through. So it
 always better in a group, then split up 
once you're outside. O.K. Uh, we had at that
 time  planned if we get away from the 
factory, but then was, once you get, we had bl
ue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what 
do you do when you escape. You're in the mi ddle of Ger many or some  place or Polish 

border or some thing. My idea was to get to my
 German friends, this Catholic family by 
the name  of Sonnon (ph) in Muchenglablak 
(ph), whose parents were friends of my 
parents, to get to the house and then to surviv
e the war in their cellar. And I am sure they 
would have done it because they helped my
 grandparents till they were deported to 
Joasenchat (ph) in 1941. And uh, uh, so Mike
 Schwab was going to go along with me . 
Either that or we go to Holland. But he wasn
't  sure where he would go to in Holland. I 
was sure where I would go to in Germany, so
 we decided it would be Germany. But then 
the question was, once you escape, a tattooed 
number on the arm and uh hair shorn. In 
other words, you looked like a prisoner. And bl
ue/white stripped uniforms that you could 

throw away if you had other clot hes, but you 
still looked like a pris
oner with no hair and 
looking like a skeleton, you were imme diat
ely recognized, so where you going to go. So 
even if you had a chance to escape, and the 
chances were there frankly, at the pl ace of 
work, in, in the synthetic gasoline factor
y. There were ma ny c hances. And some  people 
did escape, but they were all caught. And when
 they were caught, they we re brought back 
to camp and hung whether they were dead or
 not dead. They were hung or put on the 
ground for all the prisoners to see. Here's  wh
at happened. Some  of the m were shot and 
the bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners be fore 

uh going to work in the morning so everybody coul
d see it. They were left out all day, all 
night, you know, so everybody could see what ha
ppens to one who escapes. And that was 
standard procedure - to bring them ba ck to 
the camp and let all the prisoners see what 
happens to an escapee. Well, uh, I have one ot
her incident at Bleshe
imer. Uh, I got hit by 
machine gun fire. There was when a group wa
s accused of sabotaging the German war 
effort and some  people were, in this, 
this was a common, not very common, but 
occassionally some  people were accused 
of not working hard enough, to sabotage the 
German war effort. In other cases, where th
ree people were hung at Blesheimer; they 
were accused of sabotaging the war effort by 
cutting telephone lines. But what they ha d 
done, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some  of the prisoners 

had taken some wire, some electric wire and us
ed them as belts on their pants because we 
didn't have any belts. And they were caught a
nd they were accused of having cut the wire 
and they were hanged publically in front
 of the group of, the whole camp being 
assembled. In, in my case, our group was accuse
d of not working too hard and ma de an 
example, and, and the SS started firing like 
a ma ss execution. And one of our plans that 
Mike and I had was also which we had learne
d from other people, the thing to do to get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
19 
 
out of some thing, if there is not a planned 
execution where they just ma ke sure everybody 
is dead, _________, to drop the mo ment they
 start firing, to drop down, and let a body 
fall over you. And then be covered up. And ma yb
e be left for dead. And that is exactly 
what I did. But, uh in this particular case, 
the SS came, apparently they had no intention 
of ma ybe having a ma ss execution but just fi
re into some  prisoners because some body 
got angry, or was upset about some thing, 
not perfor ming enough work that they, uh 
whatever the reason was which could be ma
ny r easons. They just started firing. The 
reason as far as I know was that we didn't pe
rfor m at work. And so I was hit. Now, my 
luck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for 

that to go into that. I got out of this al
ive by getting up later 
on, going back to the 
barracks and being treated by a prisoner doctor.
 Now there was no place that I could go to 

a hospital. I was scrapped (ph) several time s,
 three or four times on my head, and right 
here, and here, and the ha ir neve r grew b
ack and there was a pi ece of bone mi ssing, but 
luckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and 
although I did have puss in it I was healed 

by this doctor. And uh with norma l thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me  

up and, and like I said there was no hospital or 
dispensary I could go to. Well, next day I 

had to go to work. There was no place to rest
 up or after loss of 
blood and so on. Uh, and 
I was asked since I was bloody and had a ba
ndage around my head, not regular bandage 
but some  old clothing, what happened. And I sa
id I got hit during the air raid. And many 
prisoners were either killed or hurt pretty ba
dly at Blesheimer during the air raids, the 
bombings of the synthetic gasoline factory. 
And then prisoners were walked back. Some  
days they we re lucky - they got some banda
ge from the local German workers. From the 

SS we got nothing. From the local German work
ers, which were also hit some ti me s. So, 
and when you walked down in the morning pe
ople would say, hey you, you fit to work. 

You say yes, I'm fit to work. I looked very
 strong even though you had lost some  blood 
you would be really weak, but that was always 
the thing during the se
lection process that 
went through several times. So eve n if 
you were, don't come walking up there like you 
weak, almos t  falling over, which was the case 
in most cases and in my case some ti me s 
too but I never let anybody see that I was weak
 and just looked straight and strong when 
you went through selection line. We ll, when 
I walked out that morning, it wasn't  a 
selection line, it was ju
st the guys going out, the guy pointed
 me  out and I said I was hit 
during the bombardment  and he passed me . So 
that's how I was able to survive that. Uh, 
Blesheimer after my fat her, did exist and I 
don't have my exa c t dates. Till December of 
1944 when the Russians advanced. At  that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate 

the camps. We could already hear the sound 
of war by hearing guns, artillery, tanks or 
whatever, bombings. And the word we got and 
we were always a little bit in the dark 
since officially we got no word at all 
what was going in the outside world, but 
occassionally some body would get a newspape
r which was sometimes in some cases 
punishable by death, depending on how the 
SS fe lt. You know, some body could bring a 

paper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if a nyone had, but uh, we were 

able to find some  old newspapers maybe at place of work some body had thrown away 

and so we were sort of infor med. But that wa
s the German side that we were reading. Uh, 
in this particular case, I uh, we heard 
the guns and the rumor came we going to be 
evacuated. Uh, where to nobody knew. Into Germany. Away from the front. That wasn't  

to do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor 

inside Germany. And they had to get it from some where. And I think, I'm not sure, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
20 
 
Auschwitz was already captured at
 that time  or not. I have no knowledge of that. But they 
were getting close to Auschwitz too, a
nd Auschwitz I don't think ma de any death 
ma rches. People were just left 
in there or killed or  whatever . But in this pa rticular  labor 
camp that we were in, or subcamp of Auschw
itz, we were evacuated. This was the plan I 
assume , and in an orderly ma nner we were 
ma rched every day, all day and in the night 
time put in a field with lights away from 
the front towards Germany. And we finally 
arrived. Wh en somebody couldn't walk because
 the food, there was almost no food, days, 
we went for days without food. Wa ter we got 
once in a while. And I 
assume , I don't  have 
any specific figure, that we 
were about four thousand or
 some where close to four 
thousand prisoners that were ma rched out 
of the camp. Some people rema ined behind, 
and there were other people in other camps that I read up after the war, that came to the 

camp. They had to put them some where. Pe
ople who had been ma rched into this camp 
from other camps when we were out already. 
They didn't know what do to with them, the 
Russians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I 
don't have any exact figures. It was very 
confusing time s but I assume  about four 
thousand prisoners were ma rched out of 
Blesheimer. Fourteen days later, the deat
h ma rch arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen 
which was another large, larger concentra
tion camp. And in the group that I was in, we  
were standing in mud being counted, and I wa
s standing in the front row being able to 
understand German, being able to understand 
the SS was reporting to his superior. He 
was delivering 276 prisoners. Now, I can't  say to 
this day if that is what was left of four 
thousand. I don't know how many got there. I 
don't know how ma ny wer e  killed every 
day. But what one of the common things they did was put . . . . . END OF TAPE . . . . . 

barnes from far mers. Wh enever they coul
d they usually put maybe about fi ve hundred 
prisoners to a barn. They would lock them up 
in the barn. This was for proper control so 
nobody could run away during the night. If they
 had you out in the open, that me ant they 
have lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. Bu
t if they could lock you up in a barn, they 
just have to post two or three guards around a
nd the rest of them could go to sleep. And 
the prisoners were locked up. Uh, so I 
don't know how ma ny people were executed in 
barns because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning 
before me in dof (ph) they said who cannot
 ma rch any more, and people would say I can, 
I can, but they were just 
dragging themselves on the ground. They would shoot them by 
the side of the road. They would just pile 
them up and fire into the group. The regular 
ma ss executions. They ma ke sure nobody is left 
behind. They even went so far to ma ke it 
easy, I don't know what they tried to do, they pi
cked cemeteries to execute people, next to 
cemeteries. Maybe they thought they ought to
 get buried in a cem
etery. I don't know why 
but it is very odd. But in 
two cases, I've seen people be ex
ecuted near cemeteries, next to 
cemeteries. Uh, so from Gross Rosen, the 276 pr
isoners plus other pris
oners that were at 
Gross Rosen, were transported in cattle cars 
to Buchenwald. This was a few days later. 
Buchenwald was of course well inside Germ
any, was on the western front. Here we'r e 
comi ng from the eastern front to the wester
n front. And we arrived at Buchenwald, we 
didn't arrive, we arrived near 
the city of Weimar, which is 
rather large city, on the track 
leading through the city 
of We i mar to the other side of, to Buchenwald. And uh we were 

very unfortunate. The train must have been 
spotted by air, by airp
lanes, and I don't know 
whether they were British or American airplanes, uh, but the train was bombed. The train 

was stationary at that time , 
the engine was stopped. But it wa
s just outside the city of 
Wei mar before getting to Buchenwald, and 
when the city was bombed, our car was hit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
21 
 
and split open. Some  people were killed. But neit
her Michael or I were 
hit at all, probably 
covered by others, and we got out of the car
, and this was near some  German home s . 
Now, we knew we were hungry, we were st
arved because we hadn't gotten any food from 
the time  we left Gross Rosen in the cattle
 cars. Uh, we went into a house, it was the 
nearest house where the car was. It was near 
the railroad tracks and went in the kitchen 
and helped ourselves. The inhabitants of this
 house were sitting in the cellar, because the 
bombing was still going on. And the clear wa
sn't  given. The mome nt the all clear was 
given we had our parkas full of food and we 
had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing 
ourselves, or loading up with food. And ma ny pr
isoners did that. Thos
e that were caught 
were shot by the SS. We  didn't get caught 
because that was uh, taboo, of course, going 
into German home s and grabbing food. But ag
ain there was no way to escape. At that 
time it would have been very easy to escap
e during the bombing. Where to go?  Hair 
shorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white
 stripped uniforms. No place to go. No. And 
it was so easy to escape at that time . Well,
 I don't know how ma ny survived the, uh, this 
bombing but the rest of us finally arrive
d at Buchenwald. Being in Buchenwald, we 
thought this was going to be the end now. 
They'r e not going to take us anymore. 
Apparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the wes t  to 

the east. The Americans were comi ng the 
other way, so, and there were selection 

processes at Buchenwald. And I didn't me ntion 
the selection processes before, but I went 

through several selection proce
sses. Some  of them were mo
re for mal than others, and 
others were just when you went to work
 guys were picked out and you stayed behind. 
You were not strong enough anymore or you go. Bu
t this was a regular selection process, 
where to we didn't know at the time. Uh, and 
again, Mike and I went
 to the right side, 
looking strong and fit, and even asked th
e questions, are you strong and do you speak 
German?  Yes. Now, O. K. So we had no idea wh
ere we were being sh
ipped off to, but we 
were given shots at that time
. I a m comi ng back to that in a minute. What worried me 
long after the war. Uh, there wa
s apparently typhus, and we ha
d heard of sterilization. In 
ma ny ca mps  there they had experime nted with
 sterilization and in some  cases people 
were sterilized just for the sake of ster
ilization and in other 
placces it was just for 
experime ntation. And I had thought
 that at Buchenwald before
 going to the next camp of 
Leigenstein-Zwieberge (ph),that I had ma ybe been sterilized. I didn't know what 

sterilization involved. It's not 
just giving some body a shot, but 
for a long, for about a year 
after the war, I never want
ed to face the question but I thought ma ybe I had been 
sterilized. But it turned out th
at I never was sterilized because  we have six children, so I 
was safe on that point. But for a long time 
it was on my mi nd, and the only thing that I 
could find out that we were given shots agai
nst typhus and some  ot
her things, which was 
prevalent at the time and they wanted healt
hy workers, healthy as they could possibly be, 
at least not have a disease that kills everyone
 in the room. Fr om Buchenwald then we uh, 
from Buche nwald we were transported to the 
camp of Leigenstein- Zwieberge (ph) which 
was a subcamp of Buchenwald, a forced la
bor camp. And it was hidden in the Harz 
Mountains. But we didn't know at the time that
 it was a secret project of the SS where 
they were building tunnels into
 the Harz Mountains. Their wa
s Mauthausen (ph) which is 
a more fa mous camp on the other end of the 
Harz Mountains and we
 were at the lower 
end of the Harz Mountains, building tunnels to
 construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like 
we have seen in the Smithsonian Museum here. Uh, the V-2 was the secret weapon of 

Hitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
22 
 
bombing. So they had picked the Harz Mountai
ns to construct a factory underneath. Now 
at the end where we were, there was no fact
ory. The factory was ope
rating up north, but 
we were constructing the second project, and 
the job consisted of being ma rched from 
work everyday from this camp which was al
so about four thousand people, and which 
was a very mi xed ca mp . The Jews were a mi nor
ity in ther e. The camp was practically led 
by communist prisoners, German 
communists, who had been th
ere, the fi rst ones in the 
camp. Another group, there was a replenishm
ent group and they were pretty well 
organized. But the camp was a terrible
 camp, was  a temporary camp. The camp had 
existed, by the time I got there, only about four
 months or five months, s o it was a brand 
new camp s o it was only going to be there for 
the purpose of constructing these tunnels. 
Uh, the ma r c h to the tunnels was very tedi
ous every day, and almost no food. And again 
the repl enishment method was five hundred peop
le from Buchenwald. Uh, each time  five 
hundred people were dead, five hundred people,
 and they were thrown in ma ss graves. 
There was no burning of bodies and I worked on 
one of the mass graves, I was detailed to 
that for a short while and fortunately only 
doing one thing, digging the hole. And today 
there are out of seven thousand prisoners who 
were totally there, for the normal a mount 
of prisoners was four thousand, but there we
re three additional thousand that came to 
replenish. So then all of them in ma s s graves 
near the camp. There is a site - I never went 
back there although I have a standing invita
tion from the East German government to 
come  back and be their guest - 
that they know of me  as the 
only survivor who lives in the 
western world. And uh so the camp is still in
 existence, a national monument, and young 
soldiers, East German, are being sworn in at
 the camp. But it is one
 of the worst camps 
that existed. So the ma ss graves are there. They have a very nice site. They send me  

pictures every year, and the 
story exists although I do believ
e that uh, uh, that ma ybe the 
story is not complete. It is pr
obably worse than if you actually r
ead this. It is not the same  
thing if somebody tells you about it is my
 opinion. You cannot picture this. You cannot 
picture going hungry. Some times I think if you 
tell some one what hungry is like. But in 
Lichtenstein, the work was th
e killing me thod of people. By
 that I me an working in 
tunnels without the proper protection. You 
had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on 
lorries out or carry them out. And then th
e blasting. They never had the prisoners far 
enough away that some body wouldn't get killed 
by the dynamite blasting and then they 
would carry the rocks off. So the German
 guards, the SS guards always stood far enough 
away so they wouldn't get hit, but they di
dn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be 

safe from the blasting, so ma ny people were 
killed. And those people had to be carried 
back at night and put into the ma ss graves
. You know, thrown in. And I also must 

me ntion one horrible thing. At the camp at Leichenstein, they buried ma ny people who 

were alive. People who were too weak, who c
ouldn't get off their knees anymore, to get 
up, to stand up to go to work, and they were put
 in a pile with the dead people and buried. 
At one time some body r e fused to bury after th
ey were all thrown in, a few live people 
were still moving. He had recognized some body 
that he knew and refused to throw earth 

on him and the ma n was shot at the ma ss grav
e. That happened to Leichenstein. And uh, 

there are ma ny stories, too ma ny of them to 
tell because it was by far the worst camp that 
I existed in, and was the leas
t known camps because it was a secret proj ect. Now, whe n I 
me ntioned it contained a secret project, th
is I also read up afte
r the war although there 
was some thing known about it, some thing speci
al about this camp. It was like a lot of 
rumors were circul ating all the time. It was 
a common rumor which turned out to be true 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
23 
 
after I read up on it that the 
order from the SS wa s that in case of, there wouldn't be no 
evacuation of the camp i n case the Americans 
come . All prisoners have to be killed, no 
survivors. Because it was considered a secret
 proj ect which they were building a special 
factory. Now, uh, while we were working in th
e tunnels, there were German engineers in 
there. I was able to get to one and ask him 
what he would do with his torn clothing. Every 
once in a while he would take some thing off that
 was torn or bring it back and even some  
of them would give it to the 
prisoners because we were always cold. First of all, it was 
freezing in there. Uh, I'm talking about th
e beginning of 1945, the mi d-winter, when we 
started there. And I asked this German engineer
 if he has any old cl
othing he could bring 
in that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he 

would. And I said I have a friend too, and I sa
id he would bring in some  warm clothing. 

So he was one of the good guys. And we were able to pick up this clothing. He left it in a 

certain place, we picked it up. And the ma in reason for this clothing was not to be warm. 

That too, but the ma in reason was to be able 
to escape. We  figured this is one camp we 
will never ge t out of if the war last s a
ny longer and we had no idea in January or 
February how long the war was going to last. And 
we say if we did well so far, we are not 
going to do well here because no way. And ther
e was killing by working people to death. 
That was all, and beating to death.  
 

Q: I just want to ask you . . . . . .  

 

A: Yes, this was one of the camps wher e Mike
 was working in another place, but at night 
time we were together in the barr acks. Uh, the specific stor y that I can tell, there are 

really too ma ny, but is how we were put in th
e barracks, just lined 
up like sardines. There 
was not enough place to sleep, for everybody to
 stretch out. There were no double bunks. 
It was just the plain floor of the barracks I 
was in. But apparently the camp was created 
for a lot less people and then there are 
four thousand people and ma ybe the camp was 
created for a thousand people. I don't know. I 
would say so. But then the people just 
stretch out on all these barrack floors. A
nd uh, at night time  when people would come  
back from work in the dar
k, there would be no light on. People would fight and actually 
strangle each other, become  like animals, 
just to get a place to sleep. And we were 

attacked ma ny times, but Mike and I, we
 always stood together and we defended 
ourselves, just for having a place to sleep. It 
was terribl e. People were just like animals 
and there were people who went to the pile 
up place where there were bodies and thought 
they could cut out a piece of meat. And they
 were caught. And some  would be severely 
punished for doing that. These peoples were c
onsidered inhuma n, but they were crazed 
from hunger, some  of these people. And pa
rticularly when some body was left in the 
barracks of a couple of days, too weak to go 
to work, and it would be the end after a few 
days anyway and people would die. And like 
I said, they grabbed some  of these people 
and buried them alive. They didn't even p
ile them up anymore outside, just took them 

directly to the mass grave. And each mass grav
e at Leigenbe rg-Zwieberge (ph) has five  
hundred people and I believe there we re six of
 them. Uh, now, the story in the barracks, 
this is one of my most vivid me mories of a
ll the camps, is that overhead, these were just 
one floor barracks, and we 
sleep on the floor. There were
 rafters overh
ead holding the 
roof together, and every mo
rning as we got up there w
ould be people hanging. Every 
morning, in every barracks. Because people kne
w they were not going to survive and any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
24 
 
day, and mi ght as well die now instead of 
living a few more days, a few more weeks. 
Well, lucky for Mike and me , we didn't feel 
that way. We  fi gure it's  got to be the end. 
We 'r e going to survive. We have to. And, 
uh, ma ybe they'r e going to evacuate us you 
know. We  also hear that the Allies are comi ng 
closer, but we were just .. And we teamed 
with four other guys at that 
time  who also had the same  id
eas. They were all about our 
age and they were all ma king it sort of, like 
we did, being able to stand up on their own 
two legs. And we said, we shall escape togeth
er. And they also had gotten civilian clothes 
like we did fr om some  ot her place they we
re working, they were wearing underneath 
their blue/white stripped uniforms. And, uh, so
 we said, well we'll try and escape and 
then we go in different directions, ma ybe 
two one way, two another way, ma ybe one SS 
guard is firing, ma ybe he'll hit some  of us
, maybe he won't hit anybody. But some of us 
will get out. But we always noticed that if
 one person would escape they would always 
hit him, by submachine gun fire. Automa tic fire. So we had that in mi nd. We always 

stuck together. And said if it comes to an 
evacuation we won't be on a death ma rch like 

the one from the eastern front that we 
will never survive, because we know what 
happened there. And we should escape then
 from the ma rch because that would be 
towards the end anyway from _______. Uh, comi
ng back to the people that were hanging 
themselves. It was our job every morning be
fore going outside for 
report period, people 
would be counted - how ma ny are still alive,
 how many are still there - that we had to 
take those bodies down from the rafters. A
nd pile them outside the barracks, and then 
another group would come  and pick them up an
d take them to the ma
ss graves. Uh, my, if 
I, for years, and I still do occasiona lly, therewasn't  a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have 

a large fami l y so my fa mily gets my mi nd off 
the se things and I have a very norma l life. I 
have had after the war, or soon after I get 
ma rried it was more norma l than ever. Uh, for 
years, when I had dreams it was about escap
ing, escaping. Because it was always on our 
mi nds, escaping. Whene ver I had a dream, even today when I am someti mes, probably 
tonight I'll have one, I will dr eam about escaping. It was a st andard thing. And that is 
what kept me alive. That's  what kept Mi
chael Schwab (ph) alive, you know. And, but the 
other dream that is more frequent than a
ny dream about the concentration camp, is about 
the people hanging themselves. There is nothing 
more vivid in my mi nd than seeing those 
people taking their own lives. It was bad 
enough, some body e l se taking your life, or ma ss 
execution, but people just givi
ng up, just plain givi ng up. And 
I have had occasions, and I 

don't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the lawn one day 

at my home, and my pants were very wet, 
and I hung up the pants in the shower, and the 

pants were just hanging there,
 and I got up during the nigh
t and that's nothing. When I 
have a bad dream, and I walked into where th
e toilet is and I saw 
these pants hanging and 
imme diately I thought some body was hanging there.
 And, uh, like suicides
 are, is one of 
the worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide. Not just by 

rafters. We  had people, and my
 thoughts have been divided 
on that - whether it was a 
courageous act or a coward's act, I'm not 
judging people when they commi t  suicide. I 
would never do it. Uh, I would feel, I 
get through things. A
nd uh, although, given 
thought, yes, I must admit I've given it t
hought. I think everyone who has been in 
concentration camp has given thought to su
icide. But uh, I have seen a ma n commit 
suicide why I thought it was a courageous act
. When he stood in front, when we we re 
repairing a railway, and the second line (ph) 
a speed train came  by and he just went in 
front of the train and he stood there facing it
 and he got run over by the train. It killed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
25 
 
him. And I, you know, there were ma ny other wa ys
. We tried to preven
t suicides, but that 
is a shameful thing in my opinion. On my
 own part, the only thing I would help 
some body t hat wants to die, let them die if they
 want to die. That's  
an old ma n that I saw 
had cut his wrists, and I shouted because ther
e wa s blood spurting from his wrists, and we 
ma de a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he 
was taken back to camp and he was beated 
up savagely and he was killed that night for tr
ying to deprive the Ge
rman state of labor. 
And that was the sentence on this guy. Y
ou couldn't even commit suicide - that  was 
against the law to commit suicide. And that ma n would have been much better off dying 
on the ground where I found him, at work. And uh, so, from then on my i dea was about 

suicide, if some body wa nts to do it, let them 
do it. Now, if it would have been some body 
close to me  it would have been a different 
story. Like if my frie
nd Mike Schwab would 
have done it, I would have tried to talk him 
out of it. But I knew that he, that just a 
mome ntary thing, it is not some thing he believes
 in. I think a lot of 
people think about it 
for a long time  be fore they do it. Or they 
do it on short notice. They say all of a sudden, 
whatever. Well, uh, these are some  of the in
cidents, and Lagenstein was probably the 

worst camp and the worst me mories I have. 
Everything goes into the background when I 
think about Langenstein. And uh, 
we were also the first time,
 I didn't me ntion this, this 
was also common practice, when you did some thing you weren't supposed to be doing, or 

they just wanted to get to you some how, you got
 beatings. Officially, 
not just being hit, 
but being laid over what they called the bok 
(ph), which is like a special chair for 
beatings, and they would lash you. Mike and 
I both got caught one time , hiding, trying to 
get out of some  work, and we got special beat
ing. But we were strong and we were able 
to survive it, although Mike got the worst of
 it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by 
other prisoners - they had to
 do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but 
my guard left for a while because he wanted 
to get some  cigarettes. And so the prisoner 
didn't beat me  as hard as he should have, and 
he told me  to shout real loud, to scream. 
And I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. 
It wa s fifty lashes and my friend Mike got 
fifty full, and his posterior was bleeding 
and pussy for a long, long time. There was 
nothing to treat him with. So this was co
mmon place. Not only at Langenstein but in 
other pl aces too. But Lagenstein was the worst.
 So I am comi ng to the next and the last 
story I think. My escape.  
 

Q: _______ 

 

A: O. K. We 're off no w.  

 

Q: ___________ 

 

A: O.K. that gives me , that's good, that gives me
 a couple of mi nutes - 
I wanted to tell that 
from beginning to end without..  
 

Q: _____________ talk about ____________  

 

A: Well, I didn't want to tell that story. Su
cking it out, some body, the doctor sucking it out 
with the mouth and then swished his mouth in
 water, with warm water. We did have 

some  war m water.

Q: ____________ 

 

A: Yes, and I'm a good healer. I heal, I get something or I don't develop infection so fast.  

 

Q: _______________ Those are the ques
tions that I have.  
 

A: Well, my da ughter asked me  yesterday, she 
knows I'm comi ng over. We  have three boys 
and three girls. Uh, why don't you wr ite your story. After this, I divorce myself from all 

these st ories. I can't  sleep. Occassionally I did it because my children went to that high 

school, I talked at the high school. Te ll me  
when we'r e on. In Falls Church, George 
Mason High School in Fa lls C
hurch. Are we on already?  
 

Q: No. 

 

A: Uh, I have talked. We  are on?   

 

Q: I just want to come  back 
to the story of your escape. ________  

 

A: O.K. We  knew the Allies were approachi
ng. And in this case the American Ar my. That 
was more or less known. Uh, some  people 
overheard the SS - they were talking the 

Americans are comi ng. O.K. What's  the next
 thing. The order was to evacuate the 
prisoners, but noboby knew where. So Mike and I ma de up our mi nd, the other four guys, 

we'r e going to escape. The first ma rch that we 
make, the first night or
 the second or third 
or whenever we can, we're not going to last fo
r fourteen days. But, as they transported us, 
we went out in groups of five hundred people, 
and the SS did that for 
a purpose. I didn't  
know that at the time . We thought it was for be
tter control. Instead
 of having a large 
group of four thousand prisoners, or three thous
and five hundred together in one group, if 
there is a ma ss escape, they cannot kill ever
ybody. So they took groups of five hundred 
people each. And we thought that was for 
better control. Have the guards around, and 

some  of them with dogs. I think each group 
had about one or two police dogs, Germa n 
Shepherds, and they were pretty vicious. A
nd I didn't even tell any story about the dogs. 

Cough. Uh, when we we re ma rched out in gr
oups of five hundred, we thought it was for 
control purpose and the order was to ma rch pr
isoners at night so the population wouldn't  
see us, and to sleep them and rest during th
e day, because the SS had 
to rest to. But we 
walked out and we were walking towa rds the 
tunnels, and then we were redirected. Now 
this I found later. I di dn't know all this at th
e time. Because from the publication that the 
East Germans sent me , what actually happened. 
The order, and this I found out after the 
war, I didn't know this at the time , the order 
was to take the groups of prisoners, in group 
of five hundred, in different tunnels and dynam
ite the tunnels and bury the prisoners alive 
in there, so there would be no survivors. 
Because the order was no survivors from that 
particular secret project. If they shoot them
, yes, they could have done it. But easier to 
drive them to the tunnels, which was just 
a few miles away, and dynamite the tunnels 
alive. But as it turned out, they were in 
radio contact with their former obs ervers, or 
troops, or whatever. Uh, there was American tank column cited comi ng around the 

mountain. And they were looking for the tunne
ls. They knew there was some thing secret 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
27 
 
going on because they are tryi ng to fi nd the tunnels by air one time because we were 
there and there was air alarm, and a torpedo 
plane and tried to put
 a torpedo into the 
tunnel. It was not successful. It was all camouf
laged. Uh, they redirected us because they 
thought the American tank column 
was going to cut us off before they get to the tunnels. 

So we ma rched back. We ma rched ________ to camp, and then we ma rched, to ma ke a 

long story short, we ma rched three nights ti
ll we actually escaped. And what happened, 
every night, they parked us, le
t us rest in a barn, just lik
e in the fi rst march. During the 
day, they took, they requisitioned a barn from
 a far mer. Since we were only five hundred 
people and they could put five hundred people in 
almost any barns, squeeze them in if it's 
a small barn, and then, bring us out at night. 
Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had 
some  potatoes and food for the prisoners. Even for five hundred because he's feeding 

cows and other animals. So in the first and second night we got some  food from the 

far mer, it wa s the only thing, and water. In 
the night time , they put the prisoners, of 
course, into these barns and 
they posted guards outside. The next morning, ma rch again. 
Whoever couldn't ma rch was shot by the SS - 
the same  system like the other. So, again, 
we were prepared at that time - we were 
wearing our civilian cl
othes underneath and we 
said we've got to go the first chance we get.
 So on the third night, we had just, we had 
decided if we had crossed several small bridges 
or small streams or rivers, we have to get 
across the river because, we could all swim, 
we knew that. And we had decided after 
crossing a bridge would be the 
most opportune mo me nt to escape and then go towards, or 
swim across because a dog would pursue you on land. But a dog would not swim across 

the river unless he is trained to do so. Bu
t the concentration camps ' dogs I  don't think 
were trained to go into wa ter. They we re trained to pursue prisoners on land. So we 

decided that ours, and then he would not, 
he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across 
water but they can smell acro
ss land, so they can follow you. If they turn the dog loose. 
Well what happened then, on the third night we
 had just come  across a small bridge. We 
didn't know where we were. We  were getting aw
ay from the American front, that's all we 
knew. Where to nobody knew. And I don't think, th
e SS were just trying to get us away 
because they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention 

among the m whether to kill or  not to kill the pr
isoners. And I think one case I heard that a 
SS tried to ma ke contact with the prisoners
, that he was a good guy, 
that they should say 
so in case the Americans come. So maybe some
 of them were O.K. and some  of the m 
were not, and some  were just scared and 
ma ybe _____ the troop transports on the roads 

and they were particularly following roads. 
And that's where all th
e transportation. As  we 
came across a small river there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were 

walking in ranks of four, with the SS on th
e side on a small country road, a body seen 
from the air, and by that I mean at night
 time, signled airplanes who would be the 
observation plane . . . TAPE ENDS . . . and pr
isoners escaped and this happened and they 
got shot. When planes were not around, they 
put the searchlights on 
and sent the dog after 
them, or they would shoot the prisoner a
nd they couldn't run so fast, you know, and ___. 

So there were several, there were, a matter 
of fac t , quite a few escapes but everyone of 
them would get caught, so we thought that the 
time to escape was near a small river if we 
were lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhea
d, just above where we
 were going to go. So 
we were lying down and we knew that were 
going to be no searchlight on and we took 
off. All six of us said go, and we went. And 
we must have been just a couple of hundred 
yards away from the river and one dog that de
cided the last mome nt's enough for us. I got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
28 
 
bitten by the dog in my l e g, and I didn't  even feel it. I didn't even know I was bitten. I 
thought, I fell a couple of times, but the 
dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went 
after the other prisoners, and I don't know to th
is date - I never found out the story - but 
only Mike and I ma de it. The others went in 
different directions, lik
e I said. That was our 
plan, to go in different directi
ons and some  of us  
get through. Either some  of these people 
are killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody a
nd we inquired a little bit about it later 
on after our liberation, but they didn't know of
 any other prisoners that escaped. They 
knew, because we were reported by the SS to
 the local police, th
ere are two escaped 
prisoners. So I assume  that the other four were killed and they found them. But Mike and 

I got to the river, and we swa m across, and 
then we were safe from the SS, from the dog, 
and the first thing we did, we figure if we 
stay out in the open, we'r e sunk. They ma ybe 
come  with a local police dog and sniff us 
out. And we didn't smell so good and uh, we 

were full of lice and I mean, even with our ci
vilian clothes on, I ha
d a black jacket on, the 
white lice we re just running around on th
e suit. And anybody would have recognized 
some body c o mi ng from a concentration camp. But anyway, the first thing we did we 

went to some, there were some  farmhouse near
by, and like I said it
 was at night and I 
don't re me mber what time it was but it must have been past mi dnight, ma ybe two or three 

in the morning and people would be asleep. So we  decided we  have to get off the roads, 

off the land where some body could find us the next morning and hid some place where it 

is safe, but not out in the open. So we got 
to a farmhouse and we found a window next to 
the, where the stable is. Underneath the stable 
there is, this was a solid build, brick stable. 
And underneath the stable they had a cellar, a
nd this was a cellar for the foods for the 
animals, and also the potatoe
 cellar. They store hugh amount
 of potatoes in Germany, and 
we decided to get in through the cellar 
hole which was from the outside, not going 
through the front. When we lifted it up, I 
let myse lf down. We  didn't know what we 
would hit in the dark, whethe
r it would be some  water or some thing. We  were scared. 
And Michael was holding on to my a r ms, and I said there mus t  be some thing below me. 

It smells like ma ybe potatoes, I wasn't  sure you know. And I guess right, I didn't know. I 

figured it was potatoes, and then he let me
 go, and ma ybe about a couple inches below 
my feet I hit potatoes. But I was afraid that 
I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop 
or whatever in the dark, and you don't know wh
a t  is going on. So anyway, Michael came  
in and then we dug a hole in the potatoes so
 we figured in the morning some body mi ght 
open up the door to the potatoe cellar, we'd be 
sitting right on top of 
the potatoes sleeping 
or some thing. So we dug a hole into the potatoe
s, covered us up with potatoes, and there 
was enough air to get in of course, that 
was no problem, until we knew the next day 

where we were and what we could do. So we
 got out the next day when everything was 

quiet, the next evening when it started getting 
dark, and we stayed th
ere a full day, and of 
course were not found. And then we went into, 
we  got some  milk to drink. We  went into 
the stable. We found some milk. I think it was 
put there for the cats
. They had a lot of 
cats. We  drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took 

and filled out pocket up with potat oes. We at
e raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were 

worried about diarrhea, of course. Anything ra
w. But we got our first real food, and then 
we went our way. Uh, we decided that to use 
the same  routine, to sleep during the day, in 

bushes, but get away from the villages 
now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the 
artillery fire that was comi ng closer and 
closer. We didn't know
 which direction. We 
didn't know which uh way should we get awa
y. Where we would go?  Woul d be another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
29 
 
village in front of us or not. But we wanted 
to get away from vill
ages, uh, because that's 
where most people were and we would be rec
ognized possibly. Uh, what we did then is 
sleep in bushes during the day near some  fi
eld or someplace and then march at ni ght 
toward the sound of fire. And that took us seve
n days. And there is a
nother little story but 
I think it is so long, un incide
nts along the way, but anyway. We ca me  to a village . .  
 

Q: We have plenty of time.  

 

A: We have plenty of time. O.K. We  ha d the 
most fantastic thing happen. I think you have to 
have, you have to be lucky. I k
eep stressing that, not just do 
some  thinking, but also be 
lucky and healthy. On the sixth day or so, 
it was just a day or two before our actual 
liberation, we were sleeping in bushes. Actu
ally one was supposed to be wa tching, one 
was supposed to be sleeping. I was supposed to
 be sleeping, Mike was supposed to be 
watching. And, but watching would not have
 helped very mu ch except some body's 

comi ng and they couldn't run away and th
en somebody would know. But we could kill 
one person. We decided if some body is getting 
dangerous and tells us to come  along with 
them or something that we 
would strangle the person. We  knew we could do it. We  had 
absolutely ma de up our  mi nd that's what 
we would do. But we were both asleep and 

being awakened by jack boots. Now jack boot
s was what the SS wore, but he was the 
local policeman. There must have been only one
 policeman in that 
little village. And uh, 
he said, identification, 
he said in German. And we said, 
well we are foreign workers, we 
are from Holland we said. And Michael star
ted talking Dutch a li
ttle bit and I spoke 
Dutch of course too, and we started mi xing our
 German with a little Dutch. And he said I 

want to see papers. We  don't have any pape
rs. He  said where are your papers. I said 
we've been bombed out. When we came back fr
om the fields from work, we were foreign 
workers here, the place wasn't  there anymore.
 Everythi ng just what we'r e wearing to 
work - that's what we have, no more papers. 
And he started looking at
 us and he started 
going like this, He saw the lice crawling ar
ound. You know, s t ay away. Then he said, 
mitcom, come with me. I said oh my God, the 
SS, where to. Well he said, and he seemed 
to be inebriated a little bit. He had just 
had a couple of drinks
, beers probably, you know. 
And the war was comi ng to an end, and thi
ngs were pretty confusing. And we could 

smell the alcohol on him,  and figured well, th
is man is ma ybe not dangerous but we don't 
want to anywhere. What  are we doing to do?  He
 had a pistol in his 
holster, and I said we 
can grab it and kill hi m but then some body is really going to come  looking for us, and 

ma ybe we can't  get that far away. Everybody be
 alerted or some thi
ng. So we figure, we 
noticed that the ma n was  not decent, but he wa
s scared. And he said at the end, he ma de a 
comment to it, well he said I have to take
 you because there are some  escaped prisoners 

in this are 
 

A: And we figured I said are we going to get th
ere. Well, he said if you, if we can identify 
you, he said you can get some te mporary papers
 because a lot of people ha ve lost their 
papers because of bomb ings. They came  ho
me  - no more homes. Bu
t I cannot let you go. 
So I said to Michael, I looked at him and 
I said, what do we do. I said, kill hi m?  You 
know, we had a little sign. But we couldn't sa
y anything, you know. We  c ould just look at 
each other and try to understand each other 
through eye mo veme nts, and we could see 
this guy wasn't  really all there. He was, as
 a ma tter of fact, he 
was about, I was going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
30 
 
say an old ma n. He was my age or older. And, 
uh, so I said we ll, let's try it. Maybe we'r e 
lucky. And, we can't , ma ybe we'r e, some body's 
going to find out about us here in the 
open anyway. If he lets us go now ma ybe then
 send a search house party for us or let's go. 
So he took us to city hall. The city hall was 
just a part-time job for - it was a full time job 
for the policeman - part-time job for the ma yor who was a farmer, and he was burning 

papers. We  came in there and he had a stove 
burning papers. And he said in German, or 

course, we couldn't understand everything, he 
said I pick up some  Dutch workers here. 
When he said that I felt pretty secure you know
. And he said they lo
st there papers in a 
bombing raid. Uh, can we give th
em some  papers?  Ah, he said, _________________, 
what's the use, the war is finished. He said
 who cares about papers the ma yor said you 
know. And he didn't want to have anything to
 do with anybody. And he looked at us and 
he said to us, and the guy, the policeman went 
in the next room to ma ke a phone call or to 
do some thing. I didn't know what he was doing, but
 he left for a second. He said to us, 
the ma yor, we have some  concentration camp 
escapees in he re, so we are being careful 

you know. He looked at us like he knew we we
re. And we fi gured he's  not going to do 
anything. So we said, well, the policeman ca me
 back in, and he said, get rid of them. I 
don't want to have anything to do with them. 
And he said, well, I said, we have to get 
some , and then we started getting frantic (ph), 
and said give us some  pape r please. I said 
that you know we lost our papers in a bomb
ing. Well I said, I can't  give you any paper. 
There is nothing you can prove, nothing I 
can prove. So anyway, there was a big 
discussion and finally said, well, we'r e not goi
ng to insist because th
is guy mi ght change 
his mi nd. And so he, the ma yor said to the 
policeman, why don't you take them and get 
them out of this village. Well, he got us out
 of the place. By the time we got to the next 

guest house, beer house, he smelled beer ag
ain, and he said well, you go this way and 
then you go to next village. Maybe they will gi ve  you some  paper. And he went into the 

beer hall. And we were free. I said, Michael,
 I said, we got out of
 some thing that could 
have turned out bad. The only th
ing it would have ma de us is
 killers. We  trying to save 
our lives and it would have gone wrong. So 
we were lucky again. And some how it was 
always a sense that we'r e going to ma ke it. 
I mean the sense never left us, Michael and 
myself. And then, some how, through luck 
or through our own thinking, or, or doing 
things the right way and uh, mostly luck, that
 we'r e going to ma ke it. The one thing that 

never left me is the sense that if anybody's 
going to ma ke it, I'm going to ma ke it. And 
never give up hope. And Michael was th
e same  way. And O.K. Now our actual 
liberation. So we went to the next village. A
nd we noticed that this village when we got 
inside, on the outskirts of the v
illage, there were fields that 
some  people had next to their 
far ms. We  s a id we cannot be out in the open fields. There wasn't  that mu ch other 

vegetation there. Let's get close to the vill
age where there are some  bushes or some thing 
and sit down or lay down and go to sleep. The Am
ericans got to be here anytime. So, we 
laid out there, and in the night we heard ta
nks rolling. And then we heard German voi ces, 
and we didn't know this, when we got there, th
ey had placed that same  evening what they 
called faukstorma (ph), which is the German 
national guard if you call it. They are old 
guys and young fellows. Last mi nute they put them into uniform and ma ke soldiers out of 

them. And t hey had placed these guys with ponc
e so founst (ph) in little holes in the 
ground to be a defense against tanks. And ponce so
 foust (ph) is a, I'm not  sure what, we 
call it a anti-tank weapon. It's 
a shoulder held weapon that onema n can fire. It's not a gun 
and they can sit in a hole and usually one 
loads the gun and one fi
res the gun. And there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
31 
 
was one very close to us, and we wanted to, th
e first thing we wanted to do was when we 
would hear tanks comi ng across the field, go 
towards the tanks, put our arms  up. But we 
figure if we do this we ma y get shot from behi
nd or some thing for deserters in the dark or 
whatever. And we didn't want to get shot
 by the other side either you know, by the 
Americans. So as the tanks were coming acros
s in the morning, it must have been about 
five o'clock in the morning, as it started getti
ng a little light - no it wasn
't  getting light that 
time - but they started comi ng about five o'cl
ock I think - I didn't  have a watch - we 
decided we'r e going to move on the ground towards them. We ll, some body noticed 

some thing moving in that one hole, and they had in the meantime had holes on the right, 

probably on both sides of where we were ____. 
But we were far enough away not to be 
seen, ma ybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from 
each hole. I don't  know, but we must have 
been right in the mi ddle. And uh, one guy called 
over in German, what is that patrol (ph) 
- is this a patrol, because they didn't know fr
om their own people that  - they just thought 
it was a German ar my patrol. And I said to 
the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut, 
shut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know
. And he probably was 
believing that we 
were Germa n patrols since he could only see 
us crawling. And then it takes the tank, one 
company of tanks for seventeen tanks, all of
 a sudden came across the field. And as soon 
as we saw the first tank comi ng we put up our 
hands and we were just hoping that they 

wouldn't start firing, because prisoners get sh
ot some times too, even if you give up. Well, 
the lead tank, the guy jumped down, and he
 spoke German, he was a German-American 
that they used as an interpreter, and he ma de
 all the tanks stop and he brought the officers 
up, the commanding officer, and they radioed ba
ck to the battalion that they had some  
guys who were escaped prisoners, 
and to ma ke a long story shor
t, they used us. In other 
words, we knew what was in front of them. 
Whi c h was the right thing to do and we were 
glad to do it. And they said you're prisone
rs, you look like prisoners. can you prove it?  
We showed the number on the arm and apparently some  of them kne w already. They had 
crossed a concentration camp, another one 
some place. This was the Third Ar mored 
Division, D Company of the 
32nd Armored Regime nt of th
e Third Armo red Division. 
One of Patton's divisions. And uh, so we had a 
small conference there, and they if we say 
any German army units, or they were part
icularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns, 
and I said all we know the German ponce de 
foust (ph), the anti-t
ank weapon, and they 
are all old or young guys as far as we can de
termine from their voi
ces but we don't know 
for sure. We  just crawled through. So they got on the tank with the P. 
 
A: system and the guy in this German sa id there are no German army troops around, there 
are only the army helpers, the national gua
rd or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young 
guys and old people - that it would be silly to 
fire one shot because the moment the first 

shot is fired, they are going to destroy the 
village. And they hoisted white flags and they 
gave up and there was not one shot fired. And 
uh, so, then, it came  to us, and we were 
taken back to battalion headquarters where th
e battalion surgeon exam
ined us right away. 
We were then put on scales and uh, it was a 
small, like a small, not hospital, a batallion 
aid station. And they had all th
e me dical equipment to take ca
re of, and that was basically 
our liberation. And then the regime ntal comm
ander came looking at us, congratulating us 
and then the company commander said if they 
want to stay with us, the boys they can 
stay with us. Then when they went into the village, they re quisitione d a house for the two 

of us, and told the wome n to ma ke a hot bath
 for us. That we were going to be bathed by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
32 
 
medics, and cleaned up completely, because they
 have to go on, and we can't go with lice 
with them on the tanks. That we have 
to be ______, and they came with Lysol and 
whatever you have as a disinf
ectant, and we were complete
ly taken care of me dically. 
And exa mined by a me dical doctor or  military doctor and found to be healthy, not ha ve 

any communicable diseases. But it actually wa
sn't  exact the fi rst day, we went through a 
couple of days of check-ups. But in the meanti
me, we were then, the first thing to do was 
get rid of the lice. And that we did. And our 
hair shorn off again for last time. And uh, 
then, we stayed, to ma ke a long story short,
 we stayed with D Company of this tank 
battalion for six months. The war was over in another few weeks. And they were taken 

out of comb at imme diately. After that village
, that was their last 
combat session. And we 
stayed with them, and with an O.K. by the 
higher ups, that we can 
stay as long as we 
want to until we find our fa milies, ‚til we 
are certain we are finding anybody fa mily. In 
the meantime, we are changed from t hese old 
prisoner garments to GI uniforms. We were 
just like soldiers without ra
nk of course and we were trea
ted in the me ss hall like kings, 
and we had access to the me ss hall, not duri
ng dinner hours but anytime we wanted to 
walk in eat. We picked up 50 pounds in th
ree mo nths. Which was really a dangerous 
thing to do because I heard a lot of prisone
rs overate, and we did too, and killed 
themselves overeating. And that basically is th
e story. And uh, so, then to finish up, after 

our escape, my first thought wa
s to find the family, but I didn
't  know where to start. And 
first we had to get back on track, get norma
l again. So Michael and I st ayed and like I 
said for six months. And then we were taken ba
ck, they were moved bac k to the area near 
Schofenborg (ph) which is near Fr ankfurt, in
to their regular area where they were going 

to settle down. This little town, which calle
d Viny Koomstad (ph) near Frankfurt. And 
this company was then settled down and we se
ttled down with them. 
We  given a place, a 
place they requisitioned. So the fi
rst thing, we still didn't have
 any papers, the question of 
papers, what to do about papers. So they inqui
red with the police and say, they have to go 
to DP camps . When we heard camps, just 
the name camps, no way we'r e going to any 
camps. We didn't know at the time about DP 
camps. To us DP ca mps was another, a 
better concentration camp. You know, another cam
p. But it wasn't  true of course. But we 
just heard the name  ca mp and we said no. 
And uh, the batallion commander said the boys 
don't have to go to any camp if they don't want
 to. They just go to get papers. So they 
commander officer sent an officer with us to
 Frankfurt DP camp. Th
is was right in the 
city of Frankfurt where ther
e was a compound where all the Jewish refugees move d in. 
Ah, not just Jewish refugees, there we re othe
r refugees, but they we
re mostly Jews that 
had been liberated from camps or we re picked
 up in other places, forced laborers from 
other foreign countries. They were in an encl
osure and there was a guard at the gate but 
you could walk in and out once you had your 
papers. But people were taken care of 
me dically and furnished papers after they were
 identified. So he took us in there and the 
uh, official said they have to stay here, 
they can't  go back with you because they don't 
have any papers. It will take ma ybe, take 
weeks before we get any confirmation on them. 
And we have such a overload here anyway, a
nd the lieutenant looked 
at us, and he said, 
well, what you decide boys. And the thing wa
s up to us, not to this guy, official there. 
And I said we'r e not staying. Papers or no 
papers, we'r e not going to stay in another 
camp. And we stay with you. So he took us 
back and then there was an agreement 
reached that we can stay until we get papers, 
until we also, even after we get papers, we 
can stay with them while we decide where our fa milies are, go back to, Mi chael to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
33 
 
Amsterdam,  Holland, and my case go both to 
Brussels, Belgium, and Muchenglablak 
(ph), Germany. Because either place our fa mily
 could have been. But we had decided in 
the case of my i mme diate family was in Bru
ssels, Belgium. My parents that we would 
meet in Brussels, Belgium. Or meet in Much
englablak (ph)  with a Cathol ic fa mily that 
we know. So I went to both places. Didn't 
find of course anybody. And I did find some 
distant cousins and I did ma ke some  cont
act with the Joint Distribution Co mmittee, 
which was of course a Jewish organiza
tion. And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed 
in Brussels, and uh, was taken care of by the 
Jewish organization in Brussels, and then 
the thing I have to get some  education and so
 on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost 
19. No, by the time I came  back I was 19 already. 
Uh, they said that I am too old for an 
orphanage, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that
 were picked up afte
r the war. But the ma n 
that ran the Joint Dist ri bution Organization 
in Brussels was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had 
been one of my father's  friends in one of 
the camps, in the French camps of St. Cyprien, 
and he said, well, 18 is the limit for orphanage
s, but you're past limit, but we'll let you 
have a little room in here, and you fi
nd a job. We 'll put you through school. We 'll do 
something for you. So I got a little room in 
the orphanage there a
nd I went to school, 
back to school, and tried to learn a trade at
 the same  ti me . And Michael went back to 
Holland at the same  time. He wasn't  as luc
ky as I was. He didn't find, we ll I didn't find 
anybody. He didn't find anyone from his fam
ily. Everybody was killed. And uh, he didn't 
have the offer to go into an orphanage or anyt
hing up there. So he went back to the Third 
Ar mored Division. They had given him papers
, they had given me  papers too, to use 
offi cial transportation and just like military, 
like an American military guy, to get back to 
this place in Germany. We were fully covere
d. So Michael took advantage of that and uh, 
ma ke his long story afterward short, he was 
adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish 
soldier, to co me  to the United Stat es. And he 
stayed with him until he ac tually left  for the 

United Stat es. I remained in Belgium, and I al
so came to the United States, but I came  in 
a different way. I came by asking for visa to 
go to the United States, and I had to wait 
until December '47 to get to the United Stat
es. I did get to the United Stat es. And the 
draft was still going on here. I was going to
 be drafted. In Europe, if you were in 
Germany of course, but Germany di dn't have an
 army, but other countries, like France, or 
Belgium, they were still drafting too after th
e war for a while. I would have been subject 

to the draft. Well, it would have been a bad 
thing after the concentr
ation camps of course. 
You know, you want to lead a regular life. But 
here the United States had nothing to do 
with me , that my past was in a concentra
tion camp. I would have been subject to the 
draft. So what I di d inst ead, I volunteered 
for military service with the agreement they 
had at this time to get the GI Bill, or  to re
main and make the military a car eer. What I was 

after getting an education fr om
 the military. I di d exactly that
. I came in as an enlisted 
man, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able 

to go to Officer's Candidate School and becam
e an officer and ma ke the Army a career 
for twenty years. And uh, I ha
d by initial boots anyw
ay with the army after my liberation 
and I was very successful. And then I joined 
the ci vil service after my military career. 
And I was another twenty years 
in the civil service. But I probably mi ssed the stor y that  
is very close to my heart that I wanted to
 me ntion about my c hildren, about my wife. And 
I ma rried a German wo ma n who 's n ot Jewi
sh, and my children grew up Jewish in 
reme mbrance of my parents. And nothing else, 
if I don't feel that 
strong about religion, I 
wanted them to have some thing. Everybody sh
ould grow up with a religion, and have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0252  
34 
 
belief, believe in some thing. And the closest 
thing to me  was bei
ng Jewish, and closer 
than that, that my parents had to die becau
se they were Jews, the sole reason, because 
they were Jews. And uh, I'm going to bri
ng up one more thing here. Uh, about two 
months ago, I ma de a trip to Germany. And I visited my, the old folks are not alive 
anymore, the Christian people that helped my
 fa mily, that helped my grandparents who 
by the way were deported to Lasenstadt (ph), 
the ghetto and also pe
rished, including an 
80 year old grandfather. My fa
ther, before he died, sat down with me  in the camps at 
night, and tried to recall everybody that was le
ft from the Willner family in Germany. 
And that possibly also had the same  fate th
at we had went to the concentration camps. 
Uh, he had a very good me mory, and he counted out all the people, nami ng name s, a nd I 

must have known personally ma ybe two-thir
ds of the people that he me ntioned. The 
others were not known to me . But they were
 all the Willner family - it was a close, 
closel y-knit fa mily who all lived in the Rhin
eland of Ger many, near
 Cologne-Dusseldorf. 
So the distances weren't very great, they 
even weren't spread out over Germany. I think 
one lived in Berlin, but the re
st of them lived in the Rhin
eland and had been living there 
for the past four hundred years. I even have
 some documentation that I got in Germany, 
with the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors
 who fi rst had the name of Willner and he 
had a Hebrew na me  of c ourse too. And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a 

German after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the fa milies that he did hi s 

dissertation on. And so when I visited recentl
y, uh, I knew this before I went that in 
months of August and September, they inviting Je
ws back to the city as guests of the city 
of Muchenglablak, which have done some  othe
r cities in Germany. My name  wasn't  on 
the list to be there, but si
nce I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on 
to some city officials to tell me someone visi
ting early and they ma de a joke of it. They 
got their dates wrong. And, uh I didn't  get th
e dates wrong because this was a personal 
visit I was making to Germany and some othe
r country. And uh, I agre
ed that I would see 
some  city officials who wanted some adva
nce infor mation on what a person like me  who 
come s back to his former hometown would feel
 like. They had a lot 
of apprehension that 
for instance, one person in '85, an old lady, wrot
e them a letter and sa
id, what is this good 
for, why reopen old wounds. Why are you invitin
g us back here?  We ll, to ma ke a long 
story short, out of the people they invited, 
probably about 90% of the people are comi ng. 
As the guests of the city, for one week. Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really 

wanted to know, particularly from one who 
got the worst. In other words, they are 
inviting people back who escaped Ge rmany. The y
 are Holocaust survivors, but they we re 
either in United States, in Great Britain, in
 uh Australia or  so me  other place. But they 
didn't know how many had been in a con
centration camp. Since I had been in 
concentration camp and uh, also probably am
 one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I 
was told, in the group that was comi ng bac
k. They wanted to know how I would feel 
about this, how I would feel about collective 
guilt, which by the wa
y, I don't believe in 
collective guilt. There are also good Germans just
 as well as there are bad Germans, and I 
am sorry to say that I've seen people in this
 country . . . END OF TAPE but then he said 
I'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you ar
e interested in this, that you're into what 
happened to your fa mily, that you went in sear
ch of your fa mi ly after the war. I have a 
book that recently came out that the German
 government put out that has about 150,000 
name s, 125 or 150 thousand I don't reme mber ex
actly of German Jews that perished.
