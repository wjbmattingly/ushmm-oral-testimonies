SIGMUND STROCHLITZ 
February 25, 1999 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Ca n we begin with you telling us your full name? 
Answer: My name s is Sigmund Strochlitz. 

Q: And whe n and where you were born. 

A: I was born in Bendezin, on the first day of
 Hanukkah 1916. But my parents registered me  
February first, 1917 to
 ma ke me  younger.  
Q: Can you tell us the full name  of both of your parents? 

A: My father™s name  was Herman 
and my mother™s name was  Rifka. 
Q: Di -- your mother™s ma iden na me? 

A: Yes, Kermer.  

Q: Can you spell that? 
A: K-e-r-m-e-r. 
Q: And do you know the name s of your grandparents? 

A: Yes. I know -- I know the first name  of my 
grandfather, who I admi r e d. His name was -- was 
Morchai. The -- my grandmother™s name I have forgotten. 

Q: And daw -- and these are your paternal grandparents? 

A: Yes. It -- no, my ma ternal. 

Q: Your ma ternal, okay. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And on the other side, do you re --

A: No, my father grew up as a 
-- after his par -- parents -- hi s pare
nts died very, ve
ry early at his 
age. 
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the to
wn that you born in, and that you grew up in? 
A: Yes. There were 31,000 Jews living in Bendezi
n. Of course there™s not a trace of them today 
in that  town. Life  was very interesting and fa m
ilies were extremely close. My grandfather lived 
across the street from our home. Life  was not ab
undant in riche -- riches, but some how we -- we 

felt that we are destined to play
 an important role in the life 
of huma nkind, that we have given 
the world the 10 comma ndments, not in order to 
achieve power, but to set moral examples. To 
set standards of how to deal, how men should deal
 with God, how me n sh
ould deal with -- with 
man. I went, as a youngster to a re
ligious, Zionist school. I stayed there for about four years and 
then my parents transferred me  into a secula r [indecipherable] school. I reme mber Friday -- 

Fridays very well. My mother 
wil -- getting up very early, goi
ng to buy [indecipherable] chicken. 
And there was exciteme nt of a Friday. Saturday 
morning I used to go with my grandfather, and 
some ti me s with my father to pray. The town on 
Saturday was completely engulfed in silence. 
You see only Jewish people ma rching to the sy
nagogue, quietly. The prayers were -- were 
[indecipherable] and you felt some  sacredness in th
e air. I loved those Fr
idays and I loved those 
Saturdays. Furthermore, I reme mber that Jews
 from its -- Jews from surrounding towns were 
comi ng to our town in order to buy chicken, fish 
and bring them into th
e shochet, the ritual 
slaughterer. They were -- they 
were buying all -- always for th
e whole week and then came the 
next Friday again. I was extremely happy in sc
hool, learning about Zi
onism, learning about -- 
about Jewish religion, and developing an extremel
y fond love for the Jewish people. The city -- 
the cultural life in the city was on a very hi
gh leve l. There was a Jewish theater, there was a 
Jewish newspaper. There was a voluntary sym
phony orchestra. There was a -- was a big library.

And there were sports clubs, and we always were
 trying to participate in the sport events. The 
community, however, was divided. There were pe
ople who belonged to a very radical Zionist 
move me nt, the Zhabotinsky move me nt. And there 
were again [indecipherable] especially where 
some of my friends belonged to
 a socialist Zi onist move me nt. 
And in the mi ddle there was the 
mean, mean Zionist. People who did 
not try to define themselves as
 -- as right wingers or left 
wingers. The Orthodox community was also divi
ded. There were strictly Orthodox groups, and 
then there we re groups that did not only believe 
that prayer is the answ
er to our problems, but 
for ming or creating, or returning to our ancient 
homeland is extremely im
portant. My two sisters 
belonged to that general Zioni
st organization, and I, as a 
young ma n, felt that perhaps the 
Zortinsky moveme nt, the move me nt  that was teachi
ng us to go and move to it -- to Israel and 
fi ght, I felt at  that  time that this is the only solu
tion. In my town, I did not feel any anti-Semitism 
when I grew up, because there were not too ma
ny Gentiles in town, and there was no contact 
whatsoever between the Jewish community and 
the Christian community. We lived separate -- 
separate lives, not mi ngling with each other. I 
remember my teachers were -- who I liked very, 
very much, they really cared. I reme mber my un cles, me rchants and [indecipherable], aunts that -

- more pious than their husbands. School frie
nds who were bookwor ms , and others who really 
didn™t care. But the discussions 
among all those groups were very 
heated. We  really believed in 
our cause, and tried to convince th
ose others to join us. We  did 
not have any luck. They were 
also convinced in their just cause. There was a 
communist mo veme nt in town. Their aim was to 

move to Soviet Union, create a stat
e there. I reme mber the name  of 
the state that they were trying 
to -- to establish, they call it Bi
ro Bijam. Some place in Siberia. I 
did not meet any of them after 
the war, and I don™t believe that some of
 them survived in the Soviet Union.  
Q: Can you tell me  some  more about -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
4 
 
A: About what? 
Q: About the group that 
you were involved in -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- that -- can you say the name  again? 

A: It was a revisionist organization formed 
by a leader, his name  was Zeev Zhabotinsky.  
Q: And to become  a me mber of that did you have to petition in any way, I mean -- 

A: No, no, no, no. We  did not have to do anythi
ng, you have to join them. [indecipherable] 
organization, and most of the people, please 
understand, were my age. Older people did not 
belong to those organizations, to 
those radical organizations. Most
 of them were part of the 
general Zionist move me nt.  

Q: What did it mean to be a me mber
, and how -- how did you get together? 
A: We  were getting together some times in 
the evenings, but mostly
 Saturdays afternoon, 
discussing events in the Jewish wo
rld, expressing our opinion, and pa
rticipating in al l events that 
were taki ng place in our town, whenever some body 
came to our town to speak to us. Those were 
really wonderful years, really 
wonderful years. My two sisters 
did belong to the general Zi onist 
organization. And I™m not sure that I reme mb
er, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my 
organization, there were mostly
 men. I don™t remember any wome
n in my organization. But in 

the general Zionist organization, 
there were a lot of wome n.  
Q: Can you tell us the name s of your
 sisters?  I don™
t believe you -- 
A: My older sister™s name was Esther
. My younger sister™s name  was Rus hka. 
Q: And at this point when you were in this
 youth group, or this gr
oup, now how old are you? 
A: At that time  I must have been 14. Around 14.  

Q: Did your parents haveopinions about the group? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
5 
 
A: No, my parents belonged to the general Zi
onist organization. This is perhaps one of the 
reasons that my sis -- two sisters 
joined that organization. They fe
lt more comfortable. It ma y be 
also that mo st of their friends belonged to that same  organization. 
Q: Did anyone in the family have a strong reaction 
to the fact that you were in a separate group?  
What -- what, for instance, did your father or your mother say about that? 

A: My father and my mo ther were very tolerant pe
ople, and they felt that if this is what I would 
like to do, this is the organization that I would like 
to belong to, they will not interfere. They will 
not interfere, as long as it is
 a Zi onist organization. Did my un
cles, who were very pious people 
object to it?  I don™t think so. I don™
t think so. They actually also 
belong to -- to radical Zionist 
organizations. 

Q: What were the goals of th
e group that you were part of? 
A: The goal was, first of all, as long as we ca
nnot move to Israel, to 
develop a strong sense of 
Jewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we ha
d in school, reinforcing it 
in such a way that -- 
that we were more free to discuss things. A
nd I don™t [indecipherable] discussing events and 
problems that are taki ng place not only in Poland, but all over the world. We used to get 

newspapers, discuss articles, ha
ve -- have opinions. And all of
 it was very exciting. We were 
looking forward to those meetings, some ti me s in 
the evening, but most of the time on Saturdays 

afternoon. 

Q: How did -- how do you ma ke sense of a kind of 
-- th-the fact that you went your separate way 
from the family, and that you were ve
ry passionate?  How do you explain that? 

A: I was young, and I was concerned with the rest
 of -- the rest of -- with the me mb ers of 
[indecipherable] who felt that -- especially the ol
der [indecipherable] that felt that we should not 
hasten the arrival of the 
Messiah, that we have no 
right to do things like this. I was resentful of it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

And I strongly believed that only power will force 
the English people to let us come  in. Only our 
determination and our willingness to fight 
and not wait for the goodwill of the English 
governme nt, is the only solution. 

Q: Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting sm
uggled in there and becoming a -- a military -- 
A: Ye -- yes, yes. I know that some  of my frie
nds who still live in Israel came in 1936 or 1937 as 
illegal immi grants, being brought 
into Israel in a very clande
stine way. I™m asking myself why 
didn™t I go. It™s a very painful que
stion. Perhaps even though I felt th
at this is the only way, and 
to feel that way, you have to have courage. Coul
d be that I did not have
 the courage to go along 
with, being 17 or 18 years old a
nd start a life on my own. M y fa m
ily was a very close fa mily, 
and I never developed a feeling that I can be al
one. And that prevented me from ma king that 
fateful decision. In hindsight of course, I wouldhave been mu ch better off, and perhaps that 

bothers me , and perhaps convince my two sisters af
ter I will be there, that they should do the 
same  thing. It bothers me . On the other hand 
I have doubts that my sisters would leave our 
parents alone. They were not young any more, and I 
am not sure that they would have accept this 
idea of going to Israel, and abandoning -- I™m using 
that word because this is the way they felt 
probably, abandoning our parents. My two sisters, if 
we can go to a different topic, joined me  in 
Kraków when I went to the university in 
19 - nine -- 1936. In 1937 they joined me . I was 
transferring to the business academy. 
I went to the university only to be able to get into medical 
school. But the quota was very low and I didn't ma
ke it. I transferred to
 the business academy 
and my si -- two sisters came  to Kraków to study.
 But at the same  ti me , I™m not proud of myself, 
I™m proud of my youngest sister. We made a deal, a
ll three of us, that ev
ery Friday one of us 
would go and spend the -- the weekend of the Sh
abbat with our parents. My youngest sister 
never failed to go. I had some ti me s a -- an event th
at I wanted to attend in
 Kraków, sports event 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

or cultural event. On Friday morning I was turn
ing to my youngest sister
 and tell Rushka, I am 
not going. It is my turn but I am not going, you be
tter go. And she always went there. She never 
left my parents alone.  
Q: Talk a little bit about what -- ca -- what a 
regular day was like in you
r home , I guess this is 
before you went to the university, but when you 
were growing up. What your mother did during 
the day, a little bit 
about your father. 
A: My father was a me rchant. My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish fa mily 

at that time , ma ybe even every Christian famil
y. We had our store and building that my father 
built in 1929. We  lived on the first floor and ther
e were three floors above us. Wa s a very, very 
capable ma n, even though he grew up without his 
parents. He was a self
 taught individual who 
cared very much about the family. I was very close to him. My father, even though he had very 

little schooling, became in that city of 31,000 Je
ws, the vice president of [indecipherabl e] you 
can call it today the federation, or whatever youwant to. That was very unusual because every 
two years we re elections. This was not an appointed
 position, you had to win the election to -- to 
-- to be part of it. He won every election as l
ong as -- as much as I reme mb er. He had a very 
wonderful way of dealing with people, a
nd my father became the [indecipherable] a 
representative of a big, big ma
nufac turing firm i n Lódz, and if
 people that are buying anything 
that were produced by that -- that manufacturing 
outfit, they had to come  to us. And I also 
reme mber the recession. My father just finished 
building the house and al
l of a sudden it became  
very, very difficult to accept the fact that people 
are not paying their bill
s. And please understand 
that in most of the businesses, people were 
buying and mi  -- and signing a note. And my father 
[indecipherable] those notes in the bank, all of a 
sudden he confronted the 
fact that they™re not 
paying their notes, and he has to -- he has to 
redeem those notes. It was a very difficult time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
8 
 
because he locked himself in one of the rooms,
 a nd did not want to listen to anybody. But as I 
told you, my  father grew up as an orphan, and he ha
d the -- he had three br
others and two sisters. 
The older brother raised the family, and was a very
 wise ma n but lived in a different city, about 
15 or 20 kilome ters from u -- from Bendezin. And he
 came and stayed with my father for a long 
time and convince him that not everything is lost
, and you should get in t
ouch with this -- with 
that ma nufa c turer in Lódz and s
ee if they will help him. And that what happened. They came and 
they bailed out my father, w
ho later on, of course, became ag
ain a very, very successful 
businessman. And those were times that were rea
lly threatening. We  -- we felt that perhaps we 
have to -- we have to leave school, and that wa
s to me , to my sisters, unacceptable. But thank 
God for my uncle, and that -- that
 manufacturing company in -- in ro
 -- in -- in Lódz that saved 
us and our family. 
Q: Do you reme mber the -- 
End of Tape One

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Just a -- a couple details. Do you reme mb
er the name of that manufacturing company? 
A: Yes, Karl Eise
rt , E-i-s-e-r-t . 
Q: Was it a --  a Polish, or German -- 
A: No, those are Germans [indecipherable] 

Q: And the name of your uncle, the uncle 
that helped your father, the older uncle? 
A: Liam. We called him Libish. 

Q: Liam Stroch. 

A: Strochlitz. 

Q: And can you tell us a little bit about your
 mother?  H-How your mother would spend an 
ordinary day. 

A: Very good question. We had in the city two old 
age homes. The people couldn™t afford to stay 
home , they came and lived in those two age -- 
two old age home s, supported by the community. 
We had also a very beautiful home for orphans, 
there were a lot of orphans. My mother spent 
most of her time  volunteering in those old age ho
me s, and in the orphan home . And she derived a 
lot of satisfaction from that. On top of it, from ti me
 to ti me I used to see 
her in the store, helping 
my father. And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it 
is not correct because we had a ma id that was 
with us for ma ny, many years. And she -- my 
two sisters and I, when we™re youngsters, were 
more afraid of her than of my 
mother. She was a strict di scipli narian. We  were afraid but we 
liked her very much because we probably realized 
that she is trying to do 
her best to -- to ma ke 
us avoid getting in trouble. She was a Polish 
woman, and came during the 
war asking my parents 
to move. I as -- I tried many, ma ny times to re me mb
er why my parents rejected the idea. I wish 
they would have accepted the idea. But there must 
have been some  reason why they rejected the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
10 
 
idea. After the war, I met a nei
ghbor of ours who survived in hidi
ng, the age of my parents. They 
told me, they were convinced that on the same 
street, my parents are hi
ding with that  lady that  
worked for us. But it is a mystery to me  why th
ey rejected to go into hiding. And some ti me s I 
feel -- I don™t know if I™m 
justified feeling that way, that they 
did not wa nt to leave us alone, we 
were youngsters still. And some ti me s I do believe,
 especially my father, who could not -- who 
could not perceive that people are going to be 
killed. He some how looked at the German nation 
with admi ration for their accomplishments, and he
 couldn™t visualize, probably -- and I am 
guessing just -- that those people 
who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and 
Bach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, 
are capable of committing such crimes, such 
heinous crimes. And he felt the war will end an
d on the [indecipherable] but I™m guessing, just . 
But he -- if he will go into hiding and we be di
scovered, he™ll be shot. Am I sure about it? No, 

I™m not. But I was thinking ma ny times about it,
 and those thoughts cr
ossed my mi nd. I wish 
they would have listened to her. She was a w
onderful woma n, but it™s water over the dam. It 
happened, and -- 

Q: Do you reme mber her name? 

A: Yes. Antosia, A-n-t-o-s-i-a. 

Q: And she was also from Bendezin? Where was she from? 

A: From the  same  town, or a neighboring town
 [indecipherable] I™m not sure any more.  
Q: What language was spoken at home ?  

A: We -- I mean, my sisters and I were communi
cating in Polish. But my fa ther was a Yiddishist, 

and there was a newspaper in Wa rsaw by the name  
of Hient, on a very, very high level. I always 
compare it with the New York Ti mes today. And we were getting that paper every day, a 

Yiddish paper, and if during the luncheon my twosisters and I did not know what a very famous 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
11 
 
journalist was writing today in the paper -- his na
me  was Margoshis, my father used to be very, 
very upset with us. And he enjoyed having those di
scussions in that -- at the table in the Yiddish 
language. There is [indecipherable] some thing that
 I will never forget. My youngest sister, before 
going in the room for lunch wa
s telling around to me  always, 
Sigmund, di d you read Margoshis™ 
column today?  You told 
me what it was. Sorry.  
Q: When do you reme mber becomi ng aware of a cha
nge in your life, o-of being apprehensive in 
any way about the future?  That possibly some th
ing was going to change? Or would -- perhaps 
hearing about Hitler, or Nazism? 

A: Yes. We were glued to the radi os, listening 
to his speeches, and we were frightened. But at 
the same  time I do reme mber that there was a fee
ling among a lot of people that he is talking 
about it only in order to gain pow
er, and to exercise power. But pe
rhaps it™s empty talk. And still 
we were frightened. Now of course, on the first 
of September 1939, when they came  to town, we 
immediately realized that it is not
 just  talk. There were two events
 the first two days of -- after 
they came to town that I will never forget. One we
re a family by the name of Schlesinger, father 
and two sons, running to the synagogue to re
scue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning 
synagogue, the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burne
d the synagogue. They were able to run in 
and bring out two Torahs. When they emerged fr
om the burning synagogue, the Nazis shot them 
on the spot. That was one event that of course 
frightened us. The second, 
han -- in hindsight, it 
was a policy probably, to frighten
 the people. On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don™t 
reme mber any more, they came to -- to -- they 
entered homes and took out some  leaders. And I 
don™t reme mber -- remember today how ma ny, but mu
st have been at least five or six, and 
hanged them in the mi ddle of the market. For noth
ing. For the fact that they were Jewish. That 
frightened us quite a bit, quite 
a bit. The people were really naïv
e in ™39. They lived during the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
12 
 
first World War, and they felt it™s going to be a 
static war. And what my parents did is to move 
part of the business to a town 
by the name  of Jarolsitsa aroun
d 30 or 40 kilome ters from my 
town, believi ng that  the war will not -- that  the 
Germans will not come as far, and they will 
survive and return. Of course, it 
turned out to be an 
illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in 
the -- together with my parents 
in that town, that all of a s
udden you realize that the ger -- 
Germans are moving very fast. And the young peopl
e were trying to hitc
hhike and go east after 
learning that the Soviet Union have entered th
e war, and occupying east 
of Poland. We strongly 
believed that we can survive there. I was one of
 them, and my sisters did not join me . Again, I 
was thinking why, why did it happen. And then I reme
mber -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all 
those seven or eight or nine days
 that it took me  to hitchhike to
 eastern Poland to the city of 
Lvov, I don™t reme mber seeing on the roads -- th
e roads were crowded -- too ma ny young ladies, 
too ma ny young wome n walking and 
trying to hitchhike and -- to
 the eastern part of Poland. 
Why?  I don™t have really a 
good answer. I don™t know why, but
 those were the facts. 
Q: Can we just go back to the first day that
 the Germans arrive in your town. If you can 
reme mber where you were, h-how you knew they 
were there. W- What it looked like, even 
smelled like? 

A: How it looked like? 

Q: Mm-hm. When they arrived. 

A: We  were at the windows. They came in in 
tanks, just shooting around indiscrimi nately. We  
are afraid to leave the home  
-- our houses. And then, I reme mber the ger -- Germans breaking 
into stores, taking whatever they
 wanted as though it™
s -- it™s theirs. Brea
king into home s, and 
taking paintings or whatever they found, and 
cutting it away. Of course, that was really 
frightening, our age, to understa
nd that people can come  -- just co
me  in and take away some thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
13 
 
that my father worked all his life, without a
ny -- any consideration a
bout anything. Wa s perhaps 
a mo ment when we felt that life will not be th
e same any more, that life has changed. I also 
reme mber that when they ever -- when they 
saw a Jew on the streets wi
th a beard, they were 
cutting it off, and laughing, and kicking people. I 
don™t remember all those -- all the time that 
they occupied Bendezin [indecipherable]. I don™t re
me mber to confront or being confronted by a 
German who showed sympathy for us, or gave
 us a piece of bread, even though my wife 
reme mbers that there was a German in Kraków 
who helped her. But I don™t reme mber. All my 
anger at the German people blocks my -- my willingness to accept there could have been a good 
German. Of course Ichanged 
my mi nd lately. But that coul
d have been behind me  not 
reme mbering that there were at least one German 
who tried to show sympat
hy or tried to help.  
Q: What did you do in those days, did your -- did your
 father sort of give 
you orders to stay in 
the house, or were you trying to ha
ve contact with your youth group? 
A: Oh no, we did not have any comf ort of the 
youth group any more, everything was -- came to a 
standstill. In the first few days I stayed home , but 
I went with my parents to
 the city of Jarolsitsa, 
where as I told you before I was hitchhiking to 
the -- to eastern -- to 
eastern Poland. But after 
being in Lvov, and I don™t reme mber, three or four
 months, my  father sent a mi  -- a mi s  -- an 
emissary to tell me that I should return home, 
that things have calme d 
down and life is almost 
norma l. My faith in the wisdom of my father
 was absolutely boundless. I went back. I had a 
difficult trip. I was on the floor -- i-in the city 
of [indecipherable] thatwere only about 10 miles 
from my town, on the floor of the railroad sta
tion. They run -- came running in, trying to find 
Jews and drag them out. I was on -- I was some how 
lying between two or three Gentiles and they 
mi ssed me . Within the next day or two days later,
 I came to town. As I told you, my father was a 
-- was the vice-president of [indecipherable] and he
 were very close to a -- to young people that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
14 
 
were in town for m -- they for med a kibbutz that th
ey were together trying to emigrate to Israel, 
waiting for certificates to Israel . And they were -- 
they were involved in -- 
in -- in producing -- in 
-- in -- in planting, I™m s orry, not producing, pl
anting food, potatoes and toma toes. And that was 
very important and my father, on behalf of the 
Judenrat, this is the way they called that 
federation that I me ntioned before, was supervisi
ng that kibbutz. I was -- my father brought me  
in and I stayed for awhile, also helping. And 
then some thing very unusual happened. I got hold 
of a book with certain laws that 
the German obs erve, and I notice th
at there is a law saying that 
people who work in defense industries -- and we
 had three enterprises working for German 
defense industry in town, they™re entitled to ad
ditional meat. They call them sverarbeiter, people 
who work hard. I took advantage of the law. I we
nt to the authorities 
and I was successful to 
convince them that those people 
over there are entitled to more 
meat. And I used to get every 
week meat designated for them. There was a saus
age factory in town [indecipherable] in the 
nearer -- neighbor town -- neighboring town, Sos
nowiec, where we worked hard and produced 
sausages. Of course it was much easier to distri
bute sausages and to cut meat for [indecipherable] 
and this is where I worked from 1940 or ™41, unt
il deportation of the -- 
in sep -- August of 1939 -
- 1943.  

Q: I just want to go over a few details, just -- ju
st to k-kind of clarify a few things. So within a 
few days, your parents packed up a few things
 and moved to a nei
ghboring town, correct? 
A: Correct. 

Q: The name of the town? 

A: Jarolsitsa 

Q: The day after that, it was ag
reed upon that you would go to Lvov. 
A: I™m not sure it was a day afte
r or three, four days after.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
15 
 
Q: Just tell us if you can, just br
iefly, a little bit about 
what you did in Lvov. You were there for 
three or four months, what -- what was it 
like at that point? Was it a refuge center? 
A: No. 
Q: No.  

A: I was able to find a family. They were butchers,
 and they said to me , alright, we will give you 
a place to sleep. So basically what I needed is
 to earn enough money to buy food. The soldiers, 
the Russian soldiers were absolutely obsessed wi
th getting a watch, gett
ing watches. This was 
their mean -- mean d-desire, to get watches. I used
 to go out and try to find out who wants to sell 
a watch and sell it to them and buy food. This is the 
way I lived for the -- for those three or four 
months. 

Q: We re you comfortable there with the Russi
an soldiers versus the German soldiers? 
A: Yes, yes, I was much more comfortable unt
il all of a sudden the Russians were transporting 
my friends to Siberia. And -- and that bothered 
me. I thought they mi ght be able to come  and 
pick me  up, too. And as I said to you before, wh
en my father sent some body to convince me to 
go back, and I said to you that I 
had boundless faith in the wisdom of
 my father, sitting here just 
now, I also believe that I was af
raid, especially that I came fr om a family that was a wealthy 
fa mily, that I would end up in 
Siberia. It was hard to rea
lizing what to expect home.  
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: I wanted to think back, when you returned fr
om your three to four months in Lvov, what did 
your hometown look like?  Had it changed in any way? 
A: As a ma tter of fact it did not. Life all of
 a sudden became semi -normal . The Germans putting 
me n, they called them the [indecipherable] who 
was now [indecipherable] together with my 
father. Not giving anything to us, not -- being gu
ided by my father. And we -- life became  se mi -
normal. We were walking the stre
ets. I am not sure that I reme
mber if our youth group me t. I had 
doubts about -- I have doubts about it. But peop
le worked, as I told you in those defense 
factories, and the illusion that we will surv
ive the war became much stronger. That was 1940 - 
™41. And furthermore, young people were -- were 
taken away by the Germans to Germany to 
work there. And here the -- the image of the man 
who was in charge of all those communities, all 
those Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M- e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary. 

Perhaps in this -- that feeling came  to me  onl
y after the war, because during war I was very 
unhappy with the fact that he is cooperating w
ith the Germans. But he understood that people 
who work are being sent to Germany to help in
 their defense industry, ma y have a mu ch better 
chance than others. Even though I reme mber disc
ussions in our groups at that time, quoting a 
very fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo
 -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the 
enemy come s, and he is asking to hand him o -- ha
nd them over one person 
that they are going to 
kill, the community should never accept it. Yes,
 we should all -- all of us should go. But Merin 
felt -- felt differently. He felt on the contrary th
at  this cooperation with the Germans and imbu -- 
imbued young people -- not imbued them, but for c
ing young people to -- to accept the fact that 
they are going to be deported, a
nd they are going to be working 
in Germa ny, was perhaps a very 
good idea. Most of them, most of t hem surviv
ed the war. [indecipherable] the war, we young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
17 
 
people couldn™t accept his decision
s of cooperation with the enem
y. On the other hand, again in 
hindsight, they had -- if he would not have, th
e Germans would have taken over everything and 
ma ssacred us, like they did later on when they 
invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942. They 
came to towns and just took out people and kille
d them, ma s sacred. And ma ybe we avoided that 
fate. Maybe. But of course, that he will found th
at he has a good relationship with the Gestapo, 
and he can do ma ny things. But again, mi sleadin
g people. He couldn™t -- yes, he could get 
some body out of a transport to Germany, but he wa
s really fulfilling their 
wishes. If he had not 
have done it, would there be other people in 
town who would have taken over the function?  
Perhaps. I don™t condemn him any more like I us
ed to during the war, and imme diately after the 
end of the war. He fulfilled a 
certain function in the life of 
the Jewish people in Bendezin, 
Sosnowiec and [indecipherable] 

Q: You -- you™re talking about Moshe Merin? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. Wa -- was he in your town before the 
Ge rmans ca me, or -- how was he a part of your 
town before that time? 

A: He was not a very highly respected person 
before the war. I don™t reme mber anything about 
his family, but I know that he was not among the 
people who gained the respect of others. How 
he emerged as a leader in 1939 is to me  a myst
ery. Maybe there are others
 who lived closer to 
him. Maybe they know the answers. I am unable to
 reme mber and tell you why he e merged as a 
leader of the Jewish [indecipherable]. He was 
not elected, of course, 
there were no elections. 
Some thing must have happened that the Germans either agreed or appointed him to be the head 

of the Jewish [indecipherable]. Not only the Je
wish community in his town, Sosnowiec, it was 
this -- it had a -- probably the same  [indeci
pherable] we had probably between 30 or 31,000 Jews 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
18 
 
and next town [indecipherable] other small su
rrounding towns. He became  the leader. Why?  I 
have no answer. 
Q: Can you talk -- we™re talking 
a little bit about their being discussion within the community 
and some  pe ople felt that Moshe Merin was -- 
was collaborating, coope
rating with the enemy. 
What did people who disagreed with what he was doing, what did they think should be done?  

And then of course, what did you think?  You di
sapproved at that time  
of him. What did you 
think he should be doing? 

A: What he should be doing? 

Q: We ll, you spoke about disagreeing with the fact that he cooperated in some  ways. 

A: Yes. 

Q: In ma ny ways, with the Germans.  

A: Yes. 

Q: What -- what did you thi
nk he should have done instead? 
A: He couldn™t do anything instead. I suppose that
, as I said before, they would have found 
another man, another substitution to making [ind
ecipherable] and coopera
te with them. You 
know, I used an expression that I learned some pl
ace, that Moshe Merin and we are confronted 

with choiceless choices. There was no way to 
-- to change anything. We  had no choices. And 
again, I do believe that -- that his -- his cooperation saved a certain numbe r of Jewish people who 

were sent to Germany and surv
ived. There is nothing, no justif
ication for cooperating with the 
Germans, and preparing lists of people that are go
ing to be taken to Auschwitz. No. No, it is not. 
But he ma y have thought, as I said before, that 
we  are going to be exposed to ma ssacres, that 
nobody will survive. Those are feelings that I had 
after the war, not during the war. There were 
other leaders in Poland that took upon themselv
es to cooperate and save. Perhaps under the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
19 
 
illusi on that time is -- will be on our side, if we w
ill dr ag it out, the war will come  to an end. Of 
course, that was an e -- just an 
illusion. That™s illusion, and before
 the war, when we listened to 
Hitler, I thought it™s just talk. It
 was not just talk. He meant it.  
Q: Did you ever meet Moshe Merin or hear him speak? 

A: Yes. Wh en you say meet, I hope you™re not imp
lying that I was sitting down with him and 
having a discussion, no. But I me t him, perhaps se
veral times, when he came  to town and was 
speaking and again everything -- people to follow hi
m and to leave and be -- to accept the fact 
that they™re going to be shipped to Ge rmany, a
nd convincing -- trying to 
convince people that 
that is -- that they will surv
ive, they will have -- they will
 work under completely di fferent 
conditions, that they -- they will not die out of hu
nger or disease. But I wa s never involved in any 
-- in any conversations with him.  

Q: When he spoke at a public rally like that
, saying those kinds of th
ings, what were people 
saying in the crowd?  Did you 
every overhear anything? 
A: No. 

Q: What were they thinki ng? 

A: Not that I reme mber. Not -- I assume that th
ere were those who believed him, and those who 
had doubts about what he is saying. But 
this is natural, it is normal. If a ma jority believed him, or 
a mi nority believed him,  who knows ?  Who knows?  But 
again, as I said before, it turned out that 
most of them survived.  

Q: Can you describe life at this point in th
e town?  Tell us a little 
bit more about how your 
father™s shop is run. You me ntioned 
a German being there to help him. 
A: Not to help him, he -- h-he -- 
he -- he was there to help them. 
Q: Your father was ther e to help the Germans? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
20 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: What -- what was the atmosphere in the shop
 like, and again what was daily life like? Wa s 
there enough food?  [inaudible] 

A: I don™t believe that I -- I t
hought that I was ever hungry. How 
did we get food?  Yes, there 
were some  s t ores open and -- and I do reme mber that Poles, they come  to town and send food. 

When I say that my fathe r  was there to help 
them, even though -- even though he was not paid, 
but I do remember that permit -- perhaps with thei
r permission or with non
e -- no -- not -- not get 
-- getting their permission, he used to take out 
from the store certain things from the store and 
sell them. And that was a bl
essing, cause we could buy food. 

Q: And whe n the Germans came to town were ther
e any new laws they passe
d, that  insisted that  
you give them personal items? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you know if you were present for any of that? 
A: If what? 
Q: If -- if -- if you e
xperienced any of that. 
A: We ll, they came to town, and after a few w
eeks everyone had to wear that yellow band and 
the sign Juden here. Of course this was alrea
dy demeaning, and some thing [indecipherable] and 
such a state of mi nd, you are losi
ng your faith, yeah. Your world is
 sudden start to feel that you 
are some thing that is -- has to live on a much 
lower level. And, as I to
ld you, we are in school -- 
there™s a school, we -- we  were very proud of 
be-belonging to the Jewish people. Whe n they 
came, i mme diately brought us down completel
y, taking away our confidence. And perhaps 
[indecipherable] they -- they took away a -- ou
r faith and resistance, even though in my town 
there was a group of young people w
ho some how were able to secu
re a gun or two guns. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
21 
 
killed a German in the street. Of course, they la
ter, the Germans came in and of course they took 
most of the young people and killed them. I™ m not su
re most, but a certain number of people that 
they killed on the spot. That what I reme mber.  
Q: You™ve me ntioned two situations now of be
ing -- sounded like they we
re asking people to go 
to Germany, and then in this case rounding 
up people after the resist
ance attack. How did you 
escape those two situations? 

A: First of all, I hope you don™t mi nd if I will correct something in your st atement. 

Q: Not at all. 

A: Not asking people to go to Germa ny, depor
ting people to go to Germa ny. I hope you don™t 

mi nd -- 

Q: Not at all. 

A: -- but I -- I am correcting that . 

Q: We ll, let me  clarify. So at that point when 
Moshe Merin, it™s -- it™s not
 a sign up, he™s not -- 
he™s just  justifying. He™s not telling people that
 they should volunteer to go to Germany. 
A: No, no. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No, he was the per -- 

Q: He™s justifying a certain deportation. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay, okay. 

A: And preparing the lists of 
people that should be deported. 

Q: Okay. 

A: What was your question? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
22 
 
Q: I-I wanted to know in those two situations, ho
w were you able to avoid, in the first one being 
chosen, in the second being rounded up pe
rhaps if I™m -- if I™m i magining it -- 
A: Yes, yeah, I avoided it because of the influenc
e of my father, and the 
fact that I was working 
on that kibbutz and being protected that way, be
ing healed that way. Th
at was [indecipherable] 
that I was not deported. 
Q: Will you tell us a little bit about the influe
nce of your father at that point in the town? 
A: Oh, his influence was dimi nished to a great 
extent, but he knew the members, all the me mbers 
of the Judenrat, and he was kept 
in very high respect, perhaps he a
voided, or he was able to -- to 
convince them not to put me  on the list, that 
somebody else go in -- in my place. I™m sure 
some body else went and took my place. Did I think 
of it at that time ?  No. But after the war, you 
know, you are going back, you are trying to determ
ine in your own mi nd what happened. And I 
came to the conclusion that some body else was de por
ted in my place. It™s 
not a very comfortable 
feeling, but again, that expre
ssion that I used, choiceless 
choices, come s to my mi nd.  
Q: At this point -- at this poi nt, is your father -- you™re a youn
g ma n, is your father talking to you 
in any way about the future or choices that ma y 
have to be ma de?  Perhap
s even a strategy of how 
to deal with danger, I guess is
 the best word for it. At this
 point people are being deported, 
people are being rounded up, they™re 
being shot in the street. Ar
e you and your father having any 
discussions about what ma y 
come for you [indecipherable] 
A: I don™t reme mber any specific discussions, but 
a lot of people in town
 were building hiding 
places in the baseme nts that were 
really difficult to discover. A
nd by -- and my father, of course, 
built such a place in our home. N
o, he build that place of hiding 
only after they brought us into 
the ghetto. In our home he did not, but after they 
brought us into the ghetto, he build a place of 
hiding. And that was perhaps the best 
indication how bad th
e situation is.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
23 
 
Q: Can you describe where the pl
ace was, or how it was hidden? 
A: The place -- yeah, the place was in our baseme nt
, and the entrance for the -- to the -- to the 
hiding place was -- was -- was done in a way to 
disguise it, how?  By putting a -- putting a big 
credenza, or whatever you call it at that time  to
 hide the entrance. And there were no signs, if I 
reme mber correctly that there is a [indeciphera
ble] even if you moved out the -- the -- the 
furniture that  was there. At the same time, th
e Germans learned, especially in homes of more 
important people that they build hidi ng places in 
there, and they found mo st of them, or all of 
them. It was again only another illusion. But you have
 to live with illusions in times like this. 
Life become s unbearable if you don™t have any illusi
ons. We  lost faith, we lost confidence, but if 
you lose illusions too, then -- th
en you are hopelessly paralyzed.  
Q: What do you mean when you say you lost faith? 

A: We lost faith in ourselves after they put 
those yellow bands and wear
ing that sign Juden. It 
was difficult for us to understand. If you are referri
ng to faith as faith in God, I am not sure at 
that point that we lost faith in God. We lost fait
h in ma n, but I am not sure that we lost faith in 
God, but we lost faith after arriving in Auschw
itz, completely in God, seeing what is happening. 
And there™s a very interesti
ng change of mi nds among people 
who arrived in Auschwitz and 
were my friends or acquaintanc
es. Maybe after the war I understood it. Pe ople who were in my 
town who I knew were very pious people, very
 pious people. [indeci
pherable] starting to 
challenge God, mocking. Maybe mo cking is a too 
strong word. And on the contrary, my friends 
who are atheists in town, who be
longed as I told you before to 
that left wing organization and 
communists -- I™m not sure about communist, but
 who belo -- belonged to the left wing 
organizations, and were atheists, all of a sudde
n became belie -- they became believers. Why?  
And again, after analyz ing it, I ha ve one answer. He
re I have an answer. I 
think that the atheists 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
24 
 
became mor e believing, blaming themselves for cr
eating that situation and forcing the wrath of 
God. And the other group, the re
ligious group couldn™t 
understand that God is not interfering. 
They learned in Jewish history 
that God interfered in ma ny inst
ances in Egypt or -- or Persia, 
whatever. Why is He all of a sudden becomi ng invi
sible. Why is he not interfering?  Seeing small 
children that are innocent being thrown into the fi
re. If I am i nnocent -- if I am guilty, fine. But 
how can you permit smal l children being th-thrown into the fire?  But again, a change happened 
in me  too, later on. I realized that 
without faith in God, or faith in 
a huma n -- in entity that is -- 
that is ma naging the world, it™s very di
ffi cult for this, very difficult for this. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: At some  point in all of this, you -- you get ma rried. 
A: Yes.  

Q: Can you tell us about that? 

A: When I came back to town, I 
-- perhaps several months later, 
either it was the second part of 
1940, I got ma rried. I got ma rried to some body who wa
s in my class in school, and with whom I 
was very close all those years. We  were what
 you call today sweethear
ts. And even though we 
accepted that we should not bring 
-- and we should not bring people 
-- well, you should not raise 
a fa mily, that -- perhaps that was the expression, 
to have children, we wanted to get married. 

Q: Why did you -- why did you think that you should not raise a family? 

A: Because I thought at that point that perhaps ther
e™s an uncertain future, and perhaps also it -- 
it will be easier to survive w
ithout having to shield or protec
t small kids. And we were young, we 
thought the war would end, and we can have childre
n at that time . We  felt it™s irresponsible for 
people getting ma rried to ha -- to tr
y to build a family, build a fa mily into a very uncertain future 
and having to protect those childre
n, that is no way for us really to
 protect. And it is a mi stake, a 
big mi stake to raise a family.  

Q: Can you tell us your wife™s name ? 

A: Sabina, S-a-b-i-n-a. 

Q: And her ma iden na me? 

A: Koninski, K-o-n-i-n-s-k-i. 

Q: And can you describe your actual wedding, were
 you able to have a -- a -- a ceremony? 
A: The ceremony took place at her ho me , only family were invited. Wa s it a happy ceremony?  I 

don™t believe so. It was a ceremony with lack of en
thusiasm, even though we were deeply in love 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
26 
 
with each other, but how could you become  happy in to the [indecipherabl e] times when you 
knew that things are going very, very badly, th
at who knows if you will survive. So why did we 
marry?  We married -- when you are 19 or 20, you are 
-- and you went out with your future wife 
for six, seven years, a desire to get ma rried -- th
e desire to get ma rried 
is stronger than logic. 
Much stronger than logic. Her parents were 
pushing, even though my parents were reluctant. 
And we got ma rried. I don™t have an
y regrets. I was in love with my
 future wife for ma ny years. I 
do believe that I made that -- at that time, th
e right decision even though my parents were not 
very happy about it. And they participated in th
e wedding, together with 
my sisters, and never 
me ntioned anything to anybody that they are unc
om -- not that I know 
of, that they are 
uncomfortable with the ma rriage. 
I™m -- I don™t believe that I am -- 
that I know more about it, or 
I reme mber more about it. 

Q: Where did you live? 

A: We lived in the same to
wn that our parents lived. 
Q: So you had your own apartment? 

A: No. We  l i ved with an aunt
 of my wife at one point.  
Q: And can you tell us a little b
it about what work you were doing
?  You™ve me ntioned it, but if 
you can just describe it a little bit more. How 
ma ny days a week, where was it, how did you get 
there? 

A: Well -- 

Q: Where you were working at that time . 

A: Yeah, I was every da y there. I wa s ev
ery da y in that fact
ory or trying t -- 
Q: You were what? 

A: I were -- I was ev
ery day in that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
27 
 
Q: Every day, right. 
A: -- sausage factory. 

Q: Okay 

A: All trying to go to -- to
 Katowice where the headquarters 
were, of the German region. And 
trying to get again, permission to -- to ge
t some  meat. And t hat was my function. 
Q: And were you assigned to that job? 

A: No, I -- I read the law and it -- and all of 
a sudden I realized that ma ybe I can help. 
Q: So after you read the law and brought
 it up, who -- who put you in that job? 
A: My father helped me  to put into the job.  

Q: And wha t  did you actually do?  We
re you ma naging the sausage ma king? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I was ma naging and trying to be 
fair in distribution. It™s not easy 
to be fair in situations like 
this. Even though I don™t reme mber being accused of
 treating people -- one group of people more 
favorable than the othe r, I don™t remember being accused of that. Wa s I unfair?  I am sure that I 

was trying to be fair. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit 
about people in town who we
re ha -- you™ve -- you felt were 
collaborating or you had evidence that they
 were collaborating with the Ge rmans? 
A: When you are saying people in
 town collaborating with the Ge
rmans, I don™t believe that I 
used that expression before. We  wer e  talking 
about Moshe Merin colla
borating with Germans. 
Were there others?  Of course
 ther e were others. I -- 
Q: I™m talking about some one w
ho mi ght -- mi ght s -- tell a German
 that you had -- that a person 
had taken an extra sausage without 
asking, or inform, or spy on people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
28 
 
A: Yes, unfortunately that happe
ns. There were some  who were 
informing on neighbors, leading 
some  Ger mans to -- to home s where they could take
 more -- take -- take out valuable things. This 
is very -- was very regrettable. Do you have to 
be informer to survive?  I don™t believe so, but 
there were infor mers, and not only there were in
formers, the Germans ha ve insisted on having a 
police force, a Jewish police force in town. And 
those police officers, wh
enever there was a day 
that they were tryi ng to round up people and deport
 them to Auschwitz or any other place, they 
were -- that Jewish police force were working wi
th the Germans. This I wish would have never 
happened. And again, would it have led to a ma ss
acre? Could very well be, if they would not 
have -- if the Jewish police would 
not have cooperated with them, that could very well be. But -- 
but perhaps, same  thing, who a m I to judge so
me body who has -- who wants to save him and his 

fa mi l y ?  Di ffi cult , very diffi cul t .  

Q: Did you have -- can you tell us when 
you first heard of the idea of the ghetto? 
A: It must have been at the end of ™42 or th
e beginning of ™43. That™s -- again, we heard about 
the ghettos much earlier, because they have -- th
e Germans established ghettos in different towns 
before they did it in my town. Why?  Maybe b
ecause my town was incorporated into Ge rmany, 
and the others were in Poland, were the -- wher
e they could -- where there were no publicity. 
Even though there were no publicity, nobody really wa
s trying to inform the western world at 
that time what is happening. But the fact that we
 were incorporated into Germany must have 

been a factor, that we were li
ving to the ghetto only at the en
d of ™42, and perhaps even ni -- 
perhaps -- perhaps not in ™42, but in 
™43. I don™t reme mber the exact date.  
Q: So you reme mber the ghetto comi ng towards the end? 

A: ™43. Before we were deported 
to -- before the -- there was a 
complete liquidation of the ghetto 
that took place on August 1943. There was no -- there wa
s -- we knew that there are -- that there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
29 
 
are qu -- establishing ghettos in 
different towns, and perhaps th
at one day it would happened in 
our town too, and it happened. But again, I re
me mber people who were -- who were terribly 
disposed to Merin, saying that he
 is avoiding it, that 
he is trying to avoid, the he is trying to 
convince them not to -- not to deport us into 
a ghetto. Did he have so
 much power?  I doubt it 
very, very much. I doubt it very, very much. Bu
t people -- some people believed in his good 
relationship with the Gestapo and that we can 
avoid it. But the decisions were not of local 
Gestapo people or even 
district Gestapo people. 
Decisions were made in Berlin. They get -- they 
got the -- got the letter, or  whatev
er. Building has to be a ghetto by 
the first of June or whatever 
it is. And they were just  fulfilling the wishes of 
the main authorities in Berlin. So I have doubt 
that he could influence local authorities to postp
one it. They would have been probably put into 
jail or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not ob
eying. Not obeying a decision ma de in Berlin 
would have cost them their lives. So I have 
great doubts that Merin wa
s able to postpone our 
being deported into the ghettos.  
Q: Can you describe what it wa -- what actual
ly happened when you went to the ghetto?  I mean, 
how much warning were you given, did you ju
st walk out of your house and leave most 
everything there, your parents -- 
A: Of course. 

Q: -- did you try to find 
your parents that day? 
A: No, I don™t reme mber , but must have been -- 
has -- had one or two days warnings that we 
have to go into the ghettos, and again that Judenr
at assigned different apar
tments. It™s extremely 
crowded. We got, I believe, two 
rooms for the entire family. 
Q: So this -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
30 
 
A: But on the other hand, and ag
ain it™s hindsight -- not hindsi
ght, but thinking about it later on, 
we may have felt that at that time, ™42, or th
e begi nning of ™43, that this is the way we will 
survive. If they are creating or building ghettos,
 they are not going to ta
ke us to annihilation 
camps. And that was a comforting -- comfor
ting th-thought. But ag
ain, an il-illusion. 
Q: So you had heard of annihi
lation camps at -- you reme mb er 
hearing about them before you 
actually went -- went to Auschwitz? 
A: I would say that in ™43, we knew, much mo
re than in ™42. We knew fr om e missaries who 
came to us, warning us that -- that there™s an 
Auschwitz, and there™s a Birkenau, and there™s a 
Treblinka and they are sent -- shipping those 
all -- deporting those people those camps, and the 
older people, and the kids and children and 
wo me n are being immediat
ely sent to the gas 
chambers. But there was one -- one event. One of 
the people who were in the train to Auschwitz 
from my town, were able before the train stopped 
in Birkenau to jump out of the train and ma de 
it back to town. And he came back and he was 
telling everybody that -- wh
at happened, and that 
we are going to be all of us shipped to Birkenau
 and that we will not survive. That was a warning 
that came  ve ry late, must have been ™43, ma ybe 
June or July of ™43. Bu
t what could we have 
done?  We  were dealing -- or li
ving in a country with a populati
on who are very hostile to us. 
When I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don™t know, I will guess 85 - 90 

percent of the people very hostile to us. They we
re taking some  money, promising to -- to sell 
out -- bring out guns, never happened. They were 
denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they 
saw some body who looked like Jewish and was tryi
ng to -- to go to -- to 
another town without 
that yellow band. They -- they had a way of 
recognizing Jews, and denouncing them. So what 
could we have done in June, July of
 1943?  Very little Very, very little. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
31 
 
Q: You say when you went into the ghetto that 
that -- it was crowded. W
ho at that point were 
you living with? 
A: With my -- 

Q: In -- in the ghetto, when
 you went into the ghetto. 
A: Yes, I know. I was living with my wife with my parents.  

Q: So then at that point you a
nd your wife did mo ve in with y
our parents. And your two sisters 
wer e  t h er e?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Wa s your grandfather there? 

A: No, my grandfather died before the war,
 and my grandmother died before the war. 
Q: Describe the room -- the rooms that you had. 

A: They were in a part of town they call it 
kamyonka. Very poor people lived there, very poor 
people, so you can imagine the rooms. I do believe 
that we had a toilet. I 
do believe that we had 
to go outside. But as I said before, and that -- I 
am reinforcing it now in my own mi nd. It could 
very well be that we thought at th
at time  that being in the ghetto
 will shield us of being -- being 

deported to a death camp. 

Q: How wer e  the sleeping arrangeme nts?  I mean, 
were -- did your mother and father have one 
room, or we re you in -- 

A: No, I think -- I am not sure that I reme mber
, but some how we ma naged to sleep on the floor, 
whatever. We ma naged. We did not let our pare
nts sleep on the floor, but
 we were probably 
lying down on the floor, and I can™t imagine beds
 for so many people in those small rooms.  
Q: What happened to your house?  
Your house, your parent™s house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
32 
 
A: Yeah, the German took it over, it was a very
 nice house. The Germans took it over. There was 
one Polish fa mily living in that  town, he was a 
doctor, his name  was Bi
aly, B-i-a -- B-i-a-l-y, 
with whom I was close. I used to spend some  ev
e nings in the 40™s in his apartment discussing -- 
discussing events. Wa s he also remo ved from that 
-- from my  father™s -- or from our ho -- house, 
I don™t remember, I don™t reme mber. I only remember that my father gave him -- we had some 
paintings. I™m not sure how valuable those painti
ngs were, there were no -- not Picassos. But he 
gave him some paintings in order to
 -- in order to preserve them a
nd give it -- give them back to 
us after the war. 

Q: Wa s there anything else that your fa mily did ta
ke with them into the ghetto?  What else did 
your father take? 

A: Yes, I am -- yes, we took certain things -- will 
I be able today to describe them, no, absolutely 
not. Of course we took certain things with us
. Yes, I do reme mber that we  were wheeling 

some thing, and everybody was. But what can 
you take, you know?  You don™
t have anyth -- any 
buses or -- or trucks to -- to transfer. You t
ook some thing that was -- that you felt -- our parents 
felt it would be absolutely necessary to ha
ve. Pretty sure it was things like this.  
Q: Were ther e any family items or religious artifacts
 that --  that were incl
uded in the things that 
you took?  

A: I doubt that there were religious
 artifacts. The fa mily, I am not 
sure any more. I am not sure.  
Q: And also, money, what -- what
 -- was there anyplace that y
ou hid money, or hid mo ney on -- 
in your clothes, or jewelry -- 

A: M-My father hi d money in a garden. It was no
t far from our home. Yes, I am positive about it. 
But after the war, a fr iend of mi ne who I told 
exactly where the money should be, went back to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
33 
 
Poland, finally to dig -- dig the money out, didn™
t find anything. People knew probably that my 
father is trying to hi
de certain things.  
Q: I-In -- what were you -- were you able to 
cele -- you know, honor the Sabbath i-in the ghetto?  
Ho -- 

A: My father was not a religious person. 

Q: Really?  Can you tell us a litt
le bit about that, because -- 
A: Yes, I will tell you, my f -- we celebrated Friday nights with our families. They were very 

happy Friday nights. He observed mo
st of the rituals, all the holid
ays. He observed very s -- very 
strictly, with one of us. But he
 -- yes, during the holidays he was going to -- to the synagogue, 
but every Saturday morning, my mother was ta
king me  to my  grandfather, who was waiting 
already on the outside , and leading me  to his s
ynagogue. And I will ne ver forget the mome nt, I™ll 
never --  I loved my grandfather, I loved him ve
ry dearly. And I will never forget those mo ments 

sitting with him and he putting his tallit over my  
head. I was so secure, must have been six or 
seven or eight years old. I was so secure sitting 
next to him with that tallit. You know, I saw him 
in the morning, this is very -- some time s praying, 
almost by heart, and I said to myself, I™ll never 
be able to do that. But the best part was -- a
nd he was -- he was praying the grace after meals. 
There™s one sentence that stuc
k into my mi nd when he was 
pronouncing loudly, I will say it in 
Hebrew [speaks Hebrew here]. I was a young boy, 
and now I™m an old ma n, but I have never 
seen a righteous ma n begging for bread. That was 
very reassuring. I di -- always waited for that 

sentence.  

Q: So then, in the ghetto, did you 
continue to celebrate Fridays? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
34 
 
A: We  never gave that up. We  were a singing 
family. I mean singing no
t professionally, but we 
all loved to sing, and he 
loved it and we were singing Friday 
night until late into
 the night. Even 
in the ghetto.  
Q: And was it -- 

A: He was able to -- to separate his Fr iday
 nights from everything that happened during the 
week. This is again an afterthought. I 
never thought of it at that time.  
Q: We re you able to separate the Friday
 night from the events [indecipherable] 
A: You ask the very good questions, I™m not -- I don™
t -- I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not 
sure. Having said that, I have to
 tell you that I enjoyed very much
 those Friday nights. Wa s it the 
singing?  Perhaps. Wa s it the fact 
that we all are together? Perhap
s. But I have fond me mories of 
those Friday nights.  
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: I need you to think back to this time in 
the ghetto. How are people treating each other?  Are 
they acting as a communi ty and trying to support 
each other?  What were you able to observe? 
A: I think unfortunately, everybody was living for 
himself. Everybody was trying to survive in a 
situation where survival  was very 
doubtful. It was difficult in [ind
ecipherable] to create a feeling 
of -- of having a common cause. Any one of us had th
e one aim, to survive. I am sure that people 
today, if they will read all the books
 and all the di aries will really
 be -- they will be unable to 
understand what indeed took place there. There™s an
 impossibility. So, for me  to say that there 
was a sense of a community is wrong; there 
was no such thing. And you ma y ask the question 
why. I told you why. Everybody lived 
for himself. We have to unde
rstand this. You will not be 
able to really know exactly, or know what
 was life about in those dreadful times. 
Q: Who did you trust at that point? 
A: I trusted my father, and I later discovered th
at I could trust my ins
tincts. I discovered in 
Auschwitz, and for certain reasons 
I did certain things without re
alizing why I am
 doing it, but 
by doing it I survived that mo me nt. So yes,
 I -- I have trust in my instincts. 
Q: Some  of the youth moveme nts in your town 
were actively resisting. What -- what did you 
know about that, and were you ever able
 to observe any of that activity? 
A: I was not part of it, so I c
ould not observe it, but I believe I 
me ntioned it before, there was a 
grou -- small group of people who were able to s
ecure a gun or two, and killed a -- a Nazi in 
town. But that was all the exte
nt of it -- there™s -- that™s 
all we have done, nothing else. 
[indecipherable] can you visuali
ze those -- that -- that situa
tion?  You cannot. Impossible. 
[indecipherable] resistance was possible. 

Q: Did you know of any activity th
at went on on the -- the kibbutz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
36 
 
A: Yes. They were already determined to resi st, those were young people determined to resist, 
and they were able to secure a few guns, and in
 August of 1943, they were shooting out from the 
kibbutz, and if they did some  da ma ge at all, nobo
dy ever was able to discover. But they were -- 
they were defending themselves. All of them, of c
ourse, were killed on the 
spot there. But they 
were trying to follow the example of t he Wa rs
aw ghetto uprising. They had some  connections 
with those people. And one woma n 
in disguise was able to go to Wa rsaw and convince them to 
give us also a couple du -- a couple gu-guns, ev
en though they had not too much either, not too 
ma ny guns e ither. And they resisted. That
 -- that -- that I -- that I know.  
Q: Is this woma n Frumka Plotnicka? 

A: Fr-Frumka. 

Q: Frumka Plotnicka. 

A: Yes, Frumka.  

Q: Was she from your town? 
A: No, she was from eastern Poland some place. 
Q: Did you ever meet her? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What was she like? 

A: Wonderful person, very idealistic. Very idealisti
c, very devoted to the Jewish people. And I™m 
going to contradict myself here. I don™t believe fr
om talking to her that she ever lost faith. She 
still believed in the cause and she still believed 
that some how they will be able to, even during 
the war, to smuggle themselves to Israel. Another illusion. 

Q: It™s interesting, when you said that this wo
man was able to go to Warsaw and convince them 
to give us some  guns, you put yourself in 
the group of resisters, in a sense.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
37 
 
A: I shouldn™t have. 
Q: Well, I think it™s interesting because I -- I --
 and I wonder if -- if you™d want to explore it a 
little, that there was a part of you that fe
lt that -- that you were part of that. 
A: I am very little. They were hiding everything, 
not talking. Maybe when I use the word us, to 
bring guns for us, ma ybe I thought of them representi
ng us. I was raised on the belief that we are 
a very tight community. And by using the word us
, I [indecipherable] to have some  conscience, 
but at the same  ti me  I fe lt probably that they 
are defending us, or they are work -- or they are 
fighting for our dignity or some thing like this. 

Q: Did you talk to them, did you admire them, or
 were you frightened to be seen with those 
young people? 

A: Whi- Which ones? 

Q: A-At the -- the kibbutz people.  

A: No. 
Q: The young idealistic kibbutz -- 
A: No, I was not frightened, I was not fright
ened. But young people who shot the German in 
town were much younger. They were the generation 
of my youngest sister, 
very idealistic, very 
idealistic. And what did they think?  What are 
you trying to accomplish?  What did they think 
would -- they would accomplish by shooting or 
killing a German?  I don™t know. I really don™t 
know. But [i ndecipherable] those young people were 
so -- so strong that they felt that I™m going 
to give my life, but I™m going to take a Nazi life, too, with me .  

Q: We re you ever asked to join that -- 

A: No, I did not. 

Q: You were never asked to? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
38 
 
A: I was never asked to. Would I 
have joined? Perhaps. I am not 
sure. The thing is, I said to you 
before, I did not have the courage to smuggle myself 
to Israel. I am not sure that I had at the time 
the courage to do some thing like this. It required 
a lot of courage, a lot 
of determination. Those 
four or five young people had it. And they also were
 students of that gymnasium that I -- that I 
attended.  
Q: These were the four or five
 students that shot the Nazi? 
A: Yeah, yes.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But they took their example from the Warsaw 
ghetto uprising. And again, le
t™s look at that -- 
at that part of the war, or that event in Wa rsaw
. Did those young fighters real
ly believed that they 
can conquer or defeat the German army, the mos t
 -- the mi ghtiest ar -- army in Europe with 
having some  home ma de bombs?  No, they never be
lieved it. But they believed in -- in exacting a 

-- exa -- exacting a -- a -- a pri
ce. And they did. They did. It took the German army longer to 
conquer the Warsaw ghetto than to 
occupy France. They did. They pa
id with their lives, yes, but 
they felt at that point I -- they had nothing to 
lose. [indecipherable] I™m going to be taken to the 
[indecipherable] and killed anyway. 
And let™s at least die in dign
ity. I wish that the population, 
the Polish population would have been more coopera
tive and helped us. And helped us to secure 
arms and to join us --  or to join the Warsaw 
ghetto in -- in a quiet up
rising that could have 
changed history, could have, if the Polish resist
ance that had enough arms, and was well or fairly 
well organized, mostly officers of the Polish arm
y. If they would have 
joined the uprising, I 
wonder what would have happened. I wonder. W
hy didn™t they?  Maybe they thought they are 
not ready, that they aren™t goi
ng to accomplish too much, that the Russians are at that time  
already in Poland and will be in Warsaw in a mo
nth or two, and at that  point they will -- they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
39 
 
will stage an uprising and -- and join the Russian ar
my. That they have no more to lose than to 
gain. I have doubts that -- that 
this was their thinking, but ma ybe. 
But I know for sure -- not for 
sure, I know and I believe that 
if they would have joined th
e Warsaw ghetto uprising, things 
could have taken 
a di fferent  t urn. 
Q: Y-Y-You™re talking about more formal resi
stance. I wonder if you could talk a bit about 
whether or not you or your fa mily or anyone you 
knew resisted in an everyday way, living in the 
ghetto. And this could mean a lot 
of things. But were there ways
 that you fe lt you were resisting 
the situation?  

A: I know that some  of t he activities, before
 we went to the ghetto, were activities where 
some how we were saying that no
t losing faith, taking part in thos
e activities asthough nothing is 
going to be happening again -- arou
nd us. And that what was to some  ene -- some  extent, a form 
of resistance. It was -- I said I 
lost faith, and most of us lost fa
ith, but those activities for --- for a 
mome nt, restored faith that -- a
nd gave us -- gave us a reprieve
 of not thinking of the everyday 
mi series. That was, to some  extent, a for m of re
sistance, resistance to su
rvive. And that was, you 
know, writing poems or taking be -- children, or 
comi ng to me etings, if there were meetings, 
gave us a feeling that not everyt
hing is lost. That we are still on 
a higher level than our enemies. 
That part, I consider resistance. 
But we didn™t really [indecipherab
le] faith or comfort in ourself, 
I doubt it, but for the mome nt it was 
good for our soul and our well-being.  
Q: So a-at this point you™re 
living in the ghetto, you™re still 
working. Your father has a hiding 
place. Are -- tell us a bit a
bout the deportations that are continuing. How are they be ing done, 
and how -- how are they being done? 

A: Are you referring to deportation 
to Germany or  deportations to camp -- to -- to death camps?  
Q: I think now to death camps. At
 what point does that start? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
40 
 
A: Start what? 
Q: When did the deportations to the death camps 
start?  Is that after 
you went into the ghetto? 
A: Oh. 

Q: Or when do you become  a ware of them, let™s say. 

A: Of what?  Of the deportations? 

Q: The deportations to the death camps. 

A: I think in the beginning of
 1943. Most or ma ybe all of the deportations were to Birkenau 
Auschwitz. That -- there were no mo re deporta
tions to Germa ny to work in the defense 
industries. And we were aware of what has happ
ened in Auschwitz, perhaps late, even though we 
were only several kilome ters from that town -- no
t several, but perhaps 20 or 30 kilome ters from 
that town. But we were aware of it late, perhaps not before -- and I™m guessing here, not before 

April - May of 1943. Poles were informing us what
 is happening. But we were also thinking at 
that time that the world must be knowing what is
 taking place here. And aren™t they going to 
warn the Nazis that -- that afte
r the war, they will all be respons
ible for what they are doing here?  
Another illusion. 

Q: You me ntioned the emissary coming back 
who had jumpe d off the train. Did you yourself 
hear him speak? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What -- what -- what was he saying?  How did 
he describe the train ri
de, and getting there? 
A: Train -- he described the trai
n ride as a -- as a -- they were
 very crowded, they couldn™t even 
move around. And the train did not stop anyplace 
except Birkenau. He jumped out almost -- 
almost [indecipherable] the camp. He  jumped out
 ma ybe -- ma ybe a mi nute or two before the 
trai n went into the camp. And he -- and I am not positive about it any mo re -- I think that he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
41 
 
able to see the chimneys. I don™t remember any 
more, but I think that what happened, he came 
back and he saw the chimneys and he saw th
e people being driven, you know. And c onvincing 
us all that we will all be brought 
there and to expect the worst. 
Q: Do you reme mber his name ?  

A: Yes. Rosensaft, R-o -- R-o-
s-e-n-s-a-f-t. Josul Rosensaft. 
Q: What happened to him?   

A: He survived the war. He survived the war an
d did some thing that I admi re hi m for . After the 
war -- he survived the war on the same camp as
 I did, Bergen-Belsen. He immediately -- or a 
week later, formed an organization to take char
ge of the camp. That was really very reassuring 
and he develop good relationship wi th the English arm
y. He used to get as much as -- as much as 
he could from them for us, and again reviving 
our spirit. That was so important, reviving our 
spirit. He™s responsible for that, 
and I -- and we should be grateful to him. Imagine same  way as -
- that Moshe Merin was not a known entity in tow
n, he was also not a very well known entity in 
town, but he turned out to be 
a real leader, a real leader. 
Q: Can you tell us about the liquidation of the ghe
tto, or are there -- excu
se, but I don™t know all 
the details, were you deported befo
re the liquidation of the ghetto? 
A: No, I was deported -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- the first of August 1942. A day before, we 
felt that some thing unusual is going to happen. 
And there were rumors and whispering around that 
the Germans are going to liquidate the ghetto. 
My fa mily -- I saw my father on that day, very 
early in the morning, and he said to me, ﬁI™m 
going into the hiding with entire fami ly. Maybe 
you should stay outside. 
Maybe you™ll be able to 
warn us, or protect us.ﬂ And 
I stayed outside. The Germans s u
rrounded the ghetto early in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
42 
 
morning, shooting and shouting and creating in [ind
ecipherable] fear in ev
eryone. I was taken to 
the railroad station with 
the fi rst transport, the fi rst train, so 
I did not see too much in town after I 
left, must have been 10 - 11 o™clock in the morning 
when they were taki ng me to the s -- to -- to 
the train station. I arrived in Auschwitz the 
same  day. And when the train stopped, I saw an 
unusual scenes. Dogs barking and jumping, SS 
me n shouting and shooting, and one SS ma n 
standing in the mi ddle, he looked to me  like a 
very high officer. And people are being asking to 
jump out of the train. It was complete chaos.
 Mothers looking for children, and we looking for 

our fathers. It was comp lete chaos. Cha-Chaos 
designed by it -- wha -- by th -- what -- chaos -- 
designed chaos is what I wanted to say. I jumped
 out of the train too, and I was brought before 
that SS officer, like everyone. And I 
saw that he is -- he is directi
ng people to the right and to the 
left, to the right, wome n with children, older pe
ople. To the left, young people. At that point I 
realize that what is going to
 happen to those older people an
d children is immediate death. And 
I™ll never forget that . Ther e were inmates that 
were coordinating everyt
hing. A [indecipherable] 
inma te walked over to us and we said to him, 
ﬁWhere are those older pe
ople going? ﬂ  He pointed 
out to the chimney and said, ﬁYou see?  See that
 smoke comi ng out from both chimneys?  Those -
- in that smoke your parents will be  in, and the 
children and older people.ﬂ I couldn™t be lieve  it, 
even though I knew. But I couldn™t believe that this is happening in such a way, so fast. Why 

didn™t I believe it? I don™t know. 
I don™t know. Of course, two or
 three years later, when I 
realized that they did not mi slead
 us, that this is what™s happ
ened. I was [indecipherable] to a 
barrack with people from my town, but before 
comi ng to the barrack they brought us to a place 
where we were tattooed, taking away everyt
hing and giving us thos
e concentration camp 
uniforms. And ma rching us to the --

Q: Okay, you were describing the food that they 
[indecipherable] I think you were describing the 
food. 
A: Yeah, in the evening we got 
a piece of bread and a -- and a s
oup. We  were at that time already 
very, very hungry. And I stayed in that part of th
e camp either two or three weeks. Then we were 
brought into another part of the 
camp. And in the morning -- in that first camp we did not work 
at all. In the morning they were dri -- you were
 driven outside and standing there for some ti me s 
two, some times three hours before they led us in
to our units to work. I was assigned to a unit 
where we were trying to clear weed
s on the river, the Vistula River.
 It was so difficult. We  were 
standing in the water, hungry. And in the evening we returned, waiting for that pi ece of bread 

and soup. And I ma de at that point that -- a deci
sion that I™m going only to eat the soup and keep 
the piece of bread for next day. That was of he
lp. I worked, and I don™t reme mber again, several 
weeks, or maybe only two weeks. And luck starte
d to play an important role in my l i fe. The 
Germans established a group of tailors all -- es
tablished tailors who we
re -- who were me nding 
uniforms, correcting uniforms and -- I mean, fixi
ng uniforms. And sometimes bringing in certain 
items that they took away from su
rvivors, like shirts and shoes and 
if they were in good shape, or 
they needed a little me nding we did it. And truc
ks were comi ng once a week
 or twice a week and 
carted away those -- that good stu
ff. I suppose they -- I suppose or I am almost sure that they 
took it to Germany because -- because consumer 
goods were not available, not too much was 
available. People could not, during the war, go 
out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties 
replacing the worn jackets or shirts. And a cousin of mi ne was 
a tailor before the war. He was 
able to bring me  in into that group. So I was re
lieved from being on the 
outside -- ou
tdo -- being 
outdoors and being under a roofall day long. He was helping me
 in that production 60 or 70

percent because I wa -- I did not know what to 
do, but he was -- everybody had to fulfill a certain 
quota, he was doing it for me  with his brother. Bu
t I guess the -- th
e kapo, after awhile, realized 
what is happening and he was singling me  out 
ma ny days and kicking me  and hitting me . But 

interesting, he did not -- he di
d not remove me . He did not rem
ove me , I  still stayed under roof, 
and -- 

Q: I™m not sure what you mean by on the roof. 

A: Under the -- under a roof. 

Q: Under a roof, okay, mm-hm, yeah, okay, under a roof. 

A: I -- I didn™t say it correctly? 

Q: No, I -- I -- I -- 

A: Und -- under -- 

Q: Under a roof. 

A: It was under a roof. 
Q: That™s right, okay. 
A: In -- in closed surroundings
, in a building, not exposed to
 nature. That was going on for 
awhile, but then for certain reasons, they closed
 that place. And I was 
again -- that must have 
been already in ™44, either February or March 
™44. I was distressed, but 
I know that they are 
going to assign me  to another commando. Wa lking 
in Birkenau, all of a sudden, a ma n turns 
around to me  and saying to me , ﬁAre you Herma n St
rochlitz™ son?ﬂ I said ye
s. ﬁI was a friend of 
your father. What are you doing? ﬂ  I told him the 
story, that I™m going to 
be assigned to another 
commando in the morning, that don™t know where 
I mi ght go assign -- be -- where I will be 
assigned to. He said, ﬁListen to 
me  some thing. I am working in the berklidinkskomer.ﬂ That was 
an outfit that was sorting out ev
erything, and responsible for givi
ng survivors if they came  in, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
45 
 
and they really needed very badly to [indeci
pherable] we had a cruel kapo, he never gave 
anything to anybody. But again I was 
under roof, and what was more i mportant was the fact that 
I had smuggled out a pair of shoes and give it to
 the people who work in the kitchen and they, in 
turn, gave me  a piece of bread. And that was 
extremely i mportant. I was in that commando for a 
long time. But again, luck, what happened?  One 
day a Pole came  in, and -- who was bleeding, 
his feet -- didn™t have any shoes 
at all, and asked the kapo to give
 him a pair of shoes. The kapo 
threw him out. You know, it™s intere
sting that those kapos were ve
ry eager to hit or to abuse 
people who in their eyes are weak. Le t me  finish th
is guy. I wa s able to throw out a pair of shoes. 
The door was open because he threw him out, andhe was sitting not far from the door, I was able 
to throw out a pair of shoes. Those shoes we
re my salvation, and I™ll tell you what happened. 

What happened was that I was shipped or deported 
to -- first to Stutthof
, the camp in northern -- 
north -- north -- north Germany, where we stay
ed, my friend and I with whom I survived 
Auschwitz [indecipherable], and with whom I wa
s very close, stayed 
in Stutthof, and I don™t 
reme mber if a week or two weeks. It™s always  a mystery to me  why they moved us around back 

and forth. They shipped us to another camp, Hifl i
ngen. We  also stayed there for a short period of 
time, and in Hiflingen, the head of the SS walked 
on the end, we were standing still, he looked at 
me  and pulled me  out and say, ﬁYou are staying in
 the barracks, you don™t have to go to work. I 

will tell you what you are going to do. If people come
 in and say to you they are si ck, if you have 
anything to give them, give them, but if not, tell 
them we have nothing to 
give them.ﬂ He brought 
a -- a bottle of aspirins after a 
day or two. That was -- that™s the 
o-on thing -- the on
ly thing that I 
had was that one bottle of aspirins. But again, 
I was protected because I was inside. Maybe the 
work inside is better than under 
roof. After awhile we were shi
pped, my friend and I, to another 
camp [indecipherable]. We were shipped to that
 camp, and we were assigned to a commando, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
46 
 
was already probably February, or
 January or February 1945. It wa
s in s -- in the south of 
Germany. The weather was mi serable, absolutely 
mi serable. Snow and ra
in and cold. We  were 
assigned to a commando that was going on ever
y day and time  to divide rocks, you know?  Why 
they needed it, a mystery to me . We  were all da
y long standing and hitting rocks, hitting rocks. 
After one or two days, my friend was a little olde
r than I was, and very wise. He was able, in 
Auschwitz -- yes, in Birkenau to take with him a razor. We  hardly ma de it back, we couldn™t 
walk, we hardly ma de it back to camp. And he said to me , ﬁSig, there™ s no way we will survive 

one day, what is the difference? Le
t™s finish it tonight.ﬂ I walked i
n, I saw the doc -- the ma n that 
I gave the pair of shoes. 

Q: The Polish ma n you gave -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- the pair of shoes to? 

A: Yes. He winked as he recogni
zes me , but he™s -- I saw that he 
has an armband as a doctor, so I 
realize that he is a doctor in 
camp. Couldn™t help too much as 
a doctor because [indecipherable] 
me dicine. After we came to our barracks, I went to 
see him. This is exactly what he said to me , 

ﬁLook sir, I cannot help you with bread, because all of us are ge
tting one portion of bread. But 
one thing I can do for you. I can convince SS me n 
with whom I am friendly to let you stay 
inside, not to go out.ﬂ And here I said some thi
ng and I did some thing, very, very proud of. Very 
proud. And here I ha d courage. I told him, I a m ve
ry grateful to you, but I 
will not stay inside if 
you cannot -- if you cannot do the same  thing for  
my friend. He threw me out and shouting to 
me , ﬁ Here everyone has to survive. What are yo
u going to gain?  You™re 
not going to sur -- both 
of you aren™t going to dri -- I ca
nnot do more. I cannot do -- I cannot
 save your friend, too.ﬂ In 
the morning he walked in and they called
 my number, 132407 out. I 
am not moving. A second, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
47 
 
or couple seconds later, I see 
the doctor whispering some thing 
to this SS ma n, he called my 
friend™s name . And we were inside til about th
e mi ddle of March if I reme mber correctly, we 
were shipped to Bergen-Belsen. I 
have to go back a little bit. 
Q: Before you do that, if you just say the name  of your friend? 
A: Romek Vineweich. I have 
to back up a little bit. 
Q: Okay. You were go -- you were going to go back. 

A: Yes. For a short period of time, I was work
ing -- September or was it 19 -- oh, it couldn™t be 
that. No. In -- in -- no, it must have been ™
43, and I™m working in a commando of -- only for a 
short period of time, where a transport came fr
om Kraków. And I was working there with my 
friend, and a woma n ap -- we approached some  
-- some people who came  from Kraków to find 
out what they know. Then, we always ask people 
who ca me  in later what they know what is 
happening. And I said to one of them, ﬁAnd yo
u are from Kraków?  What is your name ? ﬂ  
Greenberg, she said. I said to her, ﬁWha -- did yo
u have any family in my town? ﬂ  She said, ﬁYes, 
I had an uncle by the name  of Bookwhites.ﬂ A ve
ry prominent family. I said to her, ﬁYou know, 
your cousin is working in a commando where she 
can send you some -- some clothes. I will get 
in touch with her.ﬂ So people who are working 
in that camp with that  -- where they were 
working on clothi ng. ﬁI will try to ge t you some thi
ng.ﬂ And I did, I got her some  clothes. And we 
spoke two or three time s  again probably, and I 
lost track of her. When we  came to Bergen-
Belsen, my friend Rome k Vineweich, who was standi
ng once at the -- at the -- at the wires -- at 
electric wires -- I forgot  [indeciphe
rable] and he noticed her, and 
he noticed that she is dressed 
well. He started to shout to he
r and the first question she said 
to him is, ﬁIs Sigmund he re? ﬂ  He 
said yes. She said to him, ﬁLook, I am the schreibe
rin in -- in camp. Tha t  means I have to report 
every day in the morning how ma ny people died 
during the night and how many are still alive. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
48 
 
But I have access to food because of it.ﬂ Th
is -- you know, they don™t know, the Germans if 
during the night 200 people died or 50 people die
d. They have a little [indecipherable]. ﬁI will 
arrange that he has to come  because we need 
here certain materials that only the men™s camp 
have, and he will come with some -- some -- with
 a big glass, or something like -- big -- some 
containe r.ﬂ Oh, that™s be tter. ﬁAnd I will give  
you -- give him food.ﬂ And that what happened. 
And I was going to her every two days or three 
days and she give us food. And what is even 
equally important, she became my wife. I said eq
ually important, that™s more important. Have to 
correct myself. Much more important. 
Q: What -- what is her full name? 

A: Her -- her name  is -- is Rushka. Rose we 
call her here, Rose -- Ro
se Strochlitz, but her 
ma iden na me is Greenberg. 

Q: I want to go back to fill in some  of the details of -- 

A: Yes. You know, I don™t want to forget it. I me n
tioned before that I ha 
-- I was guided, or had 
confidence in instincts. What did I mean? Th
ere were, in Auschwitz, every few weeks or a 
month or two months, selections. And even t
hough we™re young people, 
again they looked at 
their faces because they were exhausted or -- 
for the gas chambers. And we never knew, because 

it™s the same  young people, if the left is good or th
e right is good. And we we
re pushed to the left 
or to the right, I don™t reme mber. Aft e r a mi nute 
I turned around to Rome k, and I said, ﬁLet™s see 
if we can go better to the left. I some how don™t f
eel right here. I don™t know what it is, but I feel 
that this is no good here. I don™t wh
y I feel that, or I think that wa
y. Let™s move to the left, not to 
the right. Let™s try to -- to smuggle ou
rself to the left.ﬂ I was right.  
Q: I don™t completely understa
nd how Rome k was your friend, was 
he a friend from your town? 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
49 
 
Q: How did you meet him?  
A: He went to the same gymnasiu
m that I did, but he was five or 
six years older. He came , not in 
™43. He was in hiding, and they brought him 
in 1944. And they assigned him to the same  

barracks, and I got attached to him and he to
 me . Why?  Who knows?  Attached very much so. 
And who knows why?  He was protecting me  all th
e time and I was protecting him. In Hilflingin, 
on that camp, I was kept inside. I had -- I could 
get more bread. I never ate it until he came. 
Yeah, I ate my portion, I always kept the sec
ond portion -- and I was hungry -- for him. He has 
described that relationship [indeci
pherable] 1946, he described it in an
 article that he wr ote for an 
Israeli newspaper, and to my great regrets, I 
was looking for that articl
e ma ny ti me s and I cannot 
find it.  

Q: I wonder if we -- you can go back to when
 you first arrive, you described arriving. Ca n you 

tell us a little bit more about when you actua
lly are given your uniforms a nd tattooed? I mean, 
what actually happened and did you 
know that was going to happen? 
A: No. We  didn™t know it was 
going to happen. We knew only fr
om the statement ma de by one 
of the inma tes that those who were the people an
d the children are going -- th-they showed us 
these chimneys, you see that smoke comi ng out. Bu
t we did not know. But the fact that they 
tattooed us led me  to believe that it™s not our
 end, it™s not my end. W
hy would they go through 
the trouble of tattooing us?  So it was reassuri
ng. You know [i ndecipherable] they shaved us 
completely. And I walked out and I had problem
s recognizing my friends and they recognizing 
me . You look so different, you know?  You look so di
fferent not in your cl
othes and -- and your 
head shaved, you know, that it was really
 di fficult to recognize each ot her.  
Q: At this point, wh-what do you know of your family?  Di -- 

A: Of my fa mily? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
50 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: You know some thing?  I knew th
at my fa mily was brought to Bi
rkenau on the third day. Why? 
Because on that transport were also pe ople who we
re -- who were not -- w
ho were not sent to -- 
to -- to -- to -- to the gas cham
bers, but to camp, and they told 
me . No, that is not correct. No, 
that is not correct . Now I reme mber a little more
. I was trying to find out where™s my fa mily. I 
know my two young sisters should be 
in the -- in the camp 
with all the rest of the wome n. They 
were not there. I didn™t count on my parents,
 but my two sisters. 
After awhile I found out 
some thing. Found out that there was a young ma
n in the train who had a gun, and he was 
shooting out of the train and he hurt an SS ma n. 
And the people were -- who were there when the 
train arrived, you know, there were always so
me  sof -- some  -- some  inma tes, you know, 
coordinating everything, told us th
at on that day, one train came  in
 that the enti -- there were no 
selections, entire train wa s taken 
imme diately to the gas chambers.So I found out very early that 
I lost my parents. And because my wi fe was in
 the bunker with my parents, she was also taken 
immediate to -- to the gas chambers.  

Q: And your sisters. 

A: And my t wo sisters, yes. 

Q: We re -- were you able to say kaddish for them?  

A: No. No. Why?  I cannot visua
lize staying -- or saying kaddish 
in the -- no, I did not. Cannot 
visualize saying kaddish in the barracks. Why?  I really don™t know. I really don™t know. 

Q: What [indecipherable]. We
 have to change tapes. 
End of Tape Six 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
A: Sitting here I™m thinking why I did not say 
kaddish. I don™t have any 
guilt feelings about it, 
because I was taught that the pr ayer of kaddish is a 
reaffirmation of life. Could I at that point re -
- reaffirm and praise God and reaffirm that life is 
-- that  life is -- is -- is
 beautiful, or  whatever 
you want to say?  I couldn™t. Did I 
think at that time, what I™m saying just now?  No. But I have to 
analyze things later on and try to determine 
in your own mi nd what was -- what were you 
thinking unconsciously. And I coul
d have thought unconsciously that 
there™s no reason for me  to 
say kaddish. Am I sure about it? No, 
I am not. But it could have happened. 
Q: Did -- do you reme mber having any -- what we
re your thoughts at that
 point about God and 
your faith? 
A: I know for sure that at th
at point, I couldn™t believe that
 there is a God, a me rciful, 
compassionate God who let tho -- whose [indeciphe
rable] let things like
 this happen to his 
chosen people. Difficult to believe.  
Q: What were you reactions then?  Was it anger, 
or sadness? To -- to th
at thought about God? 
A: Perhaps no sadness, but anger. Anger. Even t
hough I was not a religious 
person, I still felt that 
-- that God, or any -- that God could permit those 
things to take place. So anger was the right 
reaction. And as I said before, it™s
 very difficult to live without fa
ith. Very, very difficult to live. 
Very diffi cult to justify things with
out faith. You must live with faith.  
Q: Talk about that at that point
 in your life, you -- you had talked
 about losing your confidence in 
the ghetto, you were questioning yourfaith. How -- how did you keep going? 
A: Where?In camp? 

Q: I-In -- in -- in -- yes, in
 Auschwitz, in the ca mps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
52 
 
A: Luck. Luck was my - -  my biggest friend. I desc
ribed to you four situat
ions where luck played 
a very important role in surviving. Don™t be
lieve that anybody will tell you -- any of the 
survivors will tell you that they we
re smart, that™s the reason they
 survived. Oh, that is nonsense. 
Luck, being young, or comi ng to Aus c hwitz late, at 
the end of ™43 or -- 
or ™44, end of ™44, not 
™43, where -- where the war was comi ng -- we knew 
that the war was comi ng to an end, and that 
kept you going.  
Q: You -- you were still th
ere an awfully long time. 
A: In Auschwitz? 

Q: Yes.  

A: I was from -- first of all [indecipherable] the 26
th
 of October 1944. 
Q: So more than a year. 

A: Yes. But most of the time , I was working in
side, not exposed to -- to wind, rain and snow.  
Q: Can you describe your -- your ba
rracks and the kapo in charge, 
I don™t know if you reme mber 
him in any way, the name  and how he ran your barracks. 

A: Of course I don™t reme mber the name , I 
never spoke to him because he was god, you know. 
You don™t talk to god, you know. He was god in that 
barracks, that™s a ver -- he coul d kill you or  
-- or deny you the portion of bread, whatever he 
wanted to do. I never spoke to him, I don™t 
reme mber his name. He was cold. The Germans ha
d a knack of selecting those -- those -- those 
kapos or people who they felt will fulfill that functi
on that they want them to fulfill. To make our 
life absolutely mi serable, to kill
 us and to -- to abuse us, all right?  They had a knack for choosing 
those people. It was not only in my barra
cks, in all the rest  of the barr acks. 
Q: Wa s this kapo Germa n? 

A: Hm?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
53 
 
Q: Wa s he German or Polish, or -- do you reme mber? 
A: Yes [indecipherable] he was 
German. He we re a criminal.  
Q: I want to go through some  of the details of th
e -- of the day. Can you te
ll us about roll call? 
A: Yes. I me ntioned to you before
 that that roll call was either fi
ve or six o™clock in the morning. 
We were standing outsi de  for hours, and waiting to
 go out. And was very difficult, especially in 
the wintertime. Even though I knew that I will not ha
ve to go outside, that I will be able to go 

into the -- the [indeci
pherable] and be inside, those two or 
three hours -- it™s all by -- it was all by 
design, because I reme mber people after an hour 
or two just giving in, falling down and that™s 
all. They would have died anyway, you know, cause they were already that weak, you know?  

But even to ma ke the stronge
st weaker, it was by design.  
Q: So da -- when you -- 

A: They were trying to -- the reason for that roll
 call was that they were
 trying to determine how 
ma ny peopl e are on the barrack. And that was -- 
Q: When you went to roll call, did you have
 a strategy in your mi nd for surviving?  We re you 
standing next to your friend, were -- 
were you ever holding each other up? 
A: We  were -- I was standing ne
xt to my friend, holding each 
other up, but no strategy. Don™t 
believe that some thing like this could exist 
in the camp. What kind of
 strategy can you have?  
What -- what can you do?  You are at the whim of
 people who are -- whose aim is only to kill 
you. How can you prevent it? You have nothing to
 -- to defend yourself. You cannot run out 
because you are -- you ha ve the electric wires, an
d it™s powerless, with SS me n all over, they will 
shoot you immediately. Even though, 
I have to be on record that 
one of my school friends was 
able to run away from Auschwitz
, but he™s -- I believe is not th
e only survivor among the two or 
three survivors who were able to
 run away from Birkenau Auschwitz. I can tell you that he lived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
54 
 
in Israel, and he passed away. 
We were trying -- every time I came to Israel, all my school 
friends invited me  in. We were spending an even
ing together remi niscing. We  were trying for a 
year or two to convince him to tell us how he
 survived. We  couldn™t get it. One day -- one 
evening, I turned around to him -- I was very clos
e to him before the war. I said, ﬁShume k, you 
have to tell us. Just for history™
s sake, you have to tell us.ﬂ He  was thinking for a mo me nt and he 
said okay. I can tell you he was ta
lking for a couple hours. You could cut the air, it was such a 
silence in the room. And he told
 us that he had a friend who wa
s working outside the wires, and 
who hid some  clothes for him in a hole, and he 
de scribe d him -- where the hole is. And he will -- 
he will try to get him into that commando to 
be outside, and then some how during the day, 
watching, he should disappear. And he disappeare
d. And, you know, mo st of the people that tried 
to run away were hanged the next
 day. We  didn™t -- and we were 
forced to watch the hanging, of 
course. Within a day, two or three, four, they didn
't  bring him back, I said to myself and to my 
friend, he escaped. And he told us how he escaped, 
and what he did. After two days being in that 
-- in that hole -- but he took w
ith him some  food, being two days 
and two nights in that hole, he 
realized on the third day that the search is off. 
In the mi ddle of the night he slowly crawled all 
out and went to town. And he saw a light in one
 of the home s . He entered. He entered and the 
woman became very scared. He reassured her, an
d she kept him for another two or three days. 
And then he said to her, I have some  friends -- 
again, the woma n beca me  his wife later, who are -
- who look like Aryans not Jews, who are working 
in Wa rsaw on false papers. Take me  first to 
Bendezin. We will sit together, we will look 
like a -- a son, a mother driving, you know, you 
look -- nobody will pay any attention to us. A
nd he was successful. She brought him to 
Bendezin. In Bendezin he had a friend, a Pole, with 
whom he was very close. Very unusual to be 
close, but he was close with him. You -- he came from a very fine family. As a matter of fact, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
55 
 
fa mily lived in our -- in our house on the second floor. And the son was in town, and they 
decided, you have to bring him to Wa rsaw to be
 -- to -- they will infor 
-- in Warsaw they will 

fi nd for him false papers, and he will survive, togeth
er with his sisters. With the Pole™s sister s. 
Now, we will survive together with --  with a --  
a -- a family that he knew 
very well, that -- that  
he knew -- he knew that they are in Warsaw and 
where they are in Wa rsaw. That Pole was very 
smartly shrewd. He took with him on the train, so
me  bottles of liquor. And they were sitting in 
the train and trying to pretend that they are 
dr inking. SS ma n came in and he became friend of 
them, let™s have a drink. They all became  drunk 
and they didn™t reali
ze anything, they were 
drunk, comp letely drunk. And they 
came to Warsa w with him, a
nd found the -- his friends, and 
they prepared false papers for him, andhe was working in a cinema . He didn't look 

[indecipherable], but here is again some thing that
 is unexplainable. In the Warsaw ghetto he was 
rounded up with other Poles and take n to a 
place. He wound up place on the floor. An SS ma n 

walks in, and looks around and turns round to him, ﬁYou we re the one who run away from 
Auschwitz.ﬂ He knew that this is 
the end. At that mome nt, and artill
ery shell is exploding in front 
of -- of the place, and everybody is
 running away in the [indecipherable]. Wa s he s mart?  No, was 
luck. 
Q: What was his name? 

A: Levinstein. Shumek Levinstein.  

Q: How -- how was your health after several mont
hs of working in Auschwitz?  We r -- were you 

underweight -- 

A: The mo ment I went -- 

Q: -- could you -- how -- how was your health? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
56 
 
A: Not too bad. We ll, I was sitting a
ll day long and being able to -- to 
-- to -- to -- to -- to -- to 
smuggle some thing out again here as I did in the 
berklidinkskome r, and gett
ing a little bit -- and 
getting a piece of bread. Was not too bad. I 
was young. You know, I had typhoid. And again, it 
will sound too heroic, but I™m going to tell you a
bout. Maybe I should be on record, and ma ybe 
not. As I told you, I worked several weeks in a ca
mp where I me t my fut ure wife. I worked not 
doing anything really. But we had to get our f
ood from the kitchen. That was a kitchen run by 
half wome n. The head of that kitchen wa
s a mi serable person, and if the commando wa s -- 
consists of 12 people, she gave only 10 -- 10 pieces 
of -- something like this, in order to preserve 
and give the SS me n [indecipherable]. One day I 
turned around to the kapo who was the one 
kapo that I know that was not so cruel. Said 
to him, ﬁLook, today I would like to go with my 
friend to -- to get our soup.ﬂ 
Q: Is this with Rose? 

A: No, no, no. 
Q: No, with your friend. 
A: Shumek. 

Q: Okay. 

A: With Romek. 

Q: Romek, mm-hm. 

A: We went there and she did th
e same  thing. I said, we are 12 
or 15, whatever it was. Out! I 
kicked the soup completely. And she had a cane 
in her hand with a iron. She took that cane an-
and was standing straight. It™s t
oo heroic, but I have to be on record. She took that cane and she 
lifted it, and was standing strai
ght -- all of a sudden
 she let it down, and 
she started to shout, 
clean it up, give him 15. So next day in the morni
ng we are walking again in
to that camp, she is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
57 
 
standing at the gate, and -- with SS man, and th
e SS ma n is calling my number out. I said to 
Rome k, that™s it. The SS ma n and -- together wi
th her brought me into
 the kitchen. And she 
turned around to me  and said, ﬁYou are going to work
 here with me .ﬂ I stay
ed in the kitchen with 
her. And when I got the typhoid and my friend als o, we knew that they are going to take us to 
that [indecipherable] that we were going to be one day because  after one da y there they were 

taking people to so -- after two days to the ga
s chambers. I got in touch with her some how, and I 
told her what is happening, and if she can get me
, not into the [indecipherable], but to the unit on 
sil -- on my block, and I can survive there, becaus
e -- and she did it. A day before I left -- before 
they deported us from Auschwitz she came to th
e -- to the electric wires, and she threw out a 
gold -- a piece of gold and she said to Rome k, ﬁG
ive it to Sigmund, gold -- th
is is the only way to 
survive.ﬂ If you are going to -- you are able to bu
y some thing for the gold wherever they were -- 
they™re going to ship you. And it helped. But I ha
ve to tell you, again it sounds too heroic, but I 
have to be on record. She was trying, after th
e wa r -- she was a Dutch woma n, to get in touch 
with me . She was sending people and 
letters. I never responded to a
ny letters of her. I never -- I 
said to -- to the people, I will 
never see her. The fact that  she saved me and my fr iend does not 

justify what she did by causing to have tens or
 hundreds of people to die by not giving them 
enough food. I never wanted to get in touch with
 her, and I didn™t. [indecipherable] sound too 
heroic, I was already in love with my future wife. 

Q: Per-Perhaps you™re saying sh
e mi ght have also liked you. 
A: She what?  Might what -- 

Q: Might have liked you? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Romantically? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
58 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: The -- the woma n in the kitchen. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes, yes. [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, yes, she want probably to ma rry me . 

Q: I see, yes. 

A: I don™t know, I cannot prove anything. 

Q: Right.  

A: But I never, ever responded to any letter. Neve
r wanted to see her. My friend was one day in 
Amsterdam and he saw her. She was crying bitterl
y. Why doesn™t -- at least 
let --  let him answer 
a letter? I said no, she is not entitled
 to it. Does it sound too heroic?  No? 
Q: Tell us a little bit more about 
were you ever able to steal a mome
nt here or there with -- with 
your future wife, with Rose?  How were you 
able to see her, ot
her than the time -- 
A: Yeah, because I was working on their camp. 

Q: Yeah, okay. 

A: And I could see her, and spe
nd the -- and as a ma tter of fac t , 
I have already the typhoid and 
she was able, and -- with the perm
ission of my ka po to let me  go 
into their barracks and not be 
outside to sleep all day. That was of 
help, too. Again luck played a role.  
Q: Did you know you were falling in love with her? 

A: With my wife? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Not in camp.  

Q: Not in camp.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
59 
 
A: Not in camp. But we were liberated together
 and some how the fact that she told Ro me k, is 
Sigmund he re too, indicated to me  that she cares. 
Q: I want to return to the mo me nt, the time 
when you were very discouraged, and you and your 
friend were considering suicide. Can you tell 
me a little bit more a
bout that?  Had you thought 
about killing yourself before your friend showed 
you the razor, and why at that point were you 

considering it? 

A: There was no way out. I knew that I will di e the 
next day or  two days later, that we cannot 
walk even. It was a terrible winter. And I said 
to myself, or my friend said, why, why, why still 
suffer?  There™s no way out. We  cannot walk, eve
n. We  cannot walk. We  have to all day long try 
to divide those rocks and we cannot do it, so so
me body will shoot us anyway there. If an SS ma n 
walked by and say we cannot do it, he will shoot 
us anyhow. What is the use?  I am positive that 
we would have done it. Positive, if not for the doc
tor. I have  no doubts about that, that we would 
have done it. As I said before, and I hope
 I™m not offending anybody. There is no way for 
anybody to imagine, or to try to -- to -- to unde
rstand the feeling and the mood. It™s impossible. 
It™s impossible. Only people who were there are ab
le to describe them. And you have to be in the 
same position, the same situation, to be able 
to understand what was -- what -- what is 
happening, and how our mi nd worked. 
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
A: You know, I always thought -- 
Q: Just a few more questions 
about camp. Do you have any me
mory of what it sounded like? 
A: What it sounded what? 

Q: Imagine yourself in the barracks. What were
 the sounds that you would hear in camp?  At 
Auschwitz. 

A: I™m not sure I understand the question. 

Q: What would you have been hearing? 

A: You see, when could I hear anything?  When
 you are standing at the 
appelle in the morning, 
we didn™t talk. Nobody permitted us to talk. When 
we were comi ng back in the evening, we are 
so tired. Nobody think -- we li -- nobody was thinking a
bout trying to talk or to
 -- to be nostalgic. 
No. We  wer e  waiting for the piece of bread, and 
lie down, that™s all. There was not real talk 
except when a new transport came in and we wanted
 to know what is happening in the world. At 
that time we re talk, and being encouraged, you k
now?  Believing that the war is comi ng to an 
end. I reme mber -- I reme mber when the allied
 troops landed in Norma ndy, and there was a 
transpor t, I™d forgot from where. They came a
nd told us that the Americans are in Europe 
already. And that was very, very reassuring, ve
ry. It inspired confid
ence again that maybe, 
ma ybe the tragedy is comi ng to an end. But to ha
ve just -- just empty talk, that was no such 
thing. I don™t reme mber ever having any empty talk
 during the appelle, or 
during -- or after we 
came ho -- came back fr om -- from our work assignment. I don™t remember. 

Q: Was there ever -- 

A: I-I don™t reme mber, and I understand it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
61 
 
Q: Was there ever a time, eith
er in camp or whe n you mi ght have been marching some where, 
that you were allowed to sing, for instance?  We
re -- were you ever allowed to sing when you 
were in camp?  Or did you ever sing? 
A: Could very well be, but I am not sure, but in
 one of the camps it could have been Hiflingen, 
when we were mar -- they were marching -- wo 
-- ma rching out, I™m not sure that the SS ma n 
was trying to ma ke us sing a Germa n song or so
me thing like this, but I™m not sure about it. I 
don™t remember.  

Q: You™ve talked about your faith some , and -- a
nd -- and the questioning of it, did you ever -- 
did you pray once you were in the camps? 

A: No. No. 

Q: So what ke -- what kept you going? 

A: The will to survive is a very strong will. Th
e idea that  I will survive and tell the world what 
happened always was a very, very 
important el ement in that feeli
ng of survival. And the feeling 
or the statements of those who were taken to 
the gas chambers, don™t forget us, was also very 
important. Don™t forget us. This was also very 
important to me. And that was kep -- kept me  
going. That what kept me going. You are talkin
g about singing, and I would like to share 

something that to me was to some extent unde
rstandable, and to some
 extent I couldn't  

understand it. The sonderkomma ndo came one day back
 and they told a story of an old rabbi 
who was with a group of people taken to the gas 
chambers, the rabbi started to sing, and asked 

them all to sing. We  are dying as ma rtyrs, and don™
t be afraid to die. Si
nging and dancing before 
they entered the cha -- the gas chamber. It
™s good to be on [indeci
pherable] like this.  
Q: You talk about people saying don™t forget
 us. Did anyone direc
tly say that to you? 
A: What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
62 
 
Q: You said the people that were going into the gas chamber -- 
A: Mm, no. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No, but I know that people we
re saying things like this. I d
on™t remember somebody saying it 
directly to me, but I™m sure that there are peop
le who were told by those who were taken to the 
gas chambers, don™t forget me, tell the world 
what happened. Oh, I am positive about it.  
Q: How awa r e were you of the daily functioni
ng of the gas chamber and the crematorium? 
A: We  saw the sonderkommando, they were in a speci
al block, every day. And they told us that 
the people ar e being take n to showers and telling them they have to be cl ea n, and after they will 

come  out there will be food for them, and mi sl
eading them completely. When the entered the 
showers, of course, an SS ma n was throwing in 
a -- a gas can Zyklon B, and they heard in the -- 
for a couple -- for three or four mi nutes people 
shouting and then, all of a sudden everything was 
silent , they opened the doors and everybody was d
ead, of course, holdi ng to each ot her, and the 
scene was incredible, they were -- always used
 to say. Mothers holding 
children tight to them, 
their [indecipherable]. And of course they were
 immediately -- they were
 in -- SS men  started 
always to shout at them, take th
em out and bring them to the -- 
to the -- to the -- to the chimney, 
that™s all, or whatever.  

Q: But how -- 

A: So we knew exactly what was happening. We
 knew what transports are comi ng in, from 
where.  

Q: Di -- were you ever one of the people to in
form the new transports what happened to -- 
A: No, I was not -- 

Q: -- the people that went to the [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
63 
 
A: No, I was not, because I was not in th
at commando, there was a special commando. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I believe they called it Ca
nada or some thing like this. 
Q: What about s-sanitation, when
 -- were you allowed to bathe, and when were you allowed to 
go to the bathroom?  

A: In the morning. And my friend and I were ke
eping it up, they were alwa y wa -- wa -- people 
stopped after a week or two 
weeks to wash thems e lf. 
Q: People stopped washing themselves? 

A: Yes, washing themselves. We  never stopped. 
But having said that, and I don™t reme mber why, 
in Bergen-Belsen, or even ma ybe before, we ne
ver had the place where we could wash ourself. 

And when I was liberated, they had to use a specia
l oil to clean me . The dirt was in -- in my -- 
my entire body, in -- in -- in my flesh almost
, you know?  They took a special oil to clean me .  

Q: When you and your friend, were
 you aw-aware that you were pur
posely trying to continue to 
bathe a-as a way to --  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- to -- to stay -- 

A: Yes. And that is an indication where we thou
ght we can survive. The clear indication that we 
are young we will survive, as the war is comi ng to 
an end. Would I have done the same  thing if I 
would have been taken in the beginning of ™42?
 I doubt it, because the situation was so gloomy, 
the ger -- the Germans were in Moscow almo
st, in Leningrad, all 
over the world, you know?  
There was no reason for me  to believe that the 
German ar my c a n be -- can be defeated. There 
was no reason whatsoever, they -- they occupied a
ll Europe and they are now next to Stalingrad 
and Moscow and Leningrad, and how -- and again,how do we find out? New transports come  in. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
64 
 
Q: One more question on sanitation, you said yo
u were allowed to go to
 the bathroom in the 
morning, just once a day? 
A: Of course in the evening went -- went agai
n. But during the day, I doubt it very much. I doubt 

it very much. First in Poland, in the pl ace that 
I was working, inside, there was no rest room. 
There were no such thing. No. 

Q: Can -- can you tell us -- I™d just like you to tell 
us a little bit more about your friendship with 
Rome k. Wh at did you tr -- were 
you able to be with him most
 days and how did that -- 
A: All -- every day, all day long. 

Q: How -- 

A: Every day all day long. You see, and ag
ain, probably subconsciously, when you know that 
you lost everything, that you have no fa mily, you 
are trying to forge a friendship with some body 
who™ll be with you, giving you the feeling that 
you are not alone. And that cemented that 
friendship. I can lean on him, and he on me . He
 could watch my -- my -- my -- my pi ece of 
bread, and I can watch his piece of 
bread. And you are as eager to ma
ke sure that he will survive 
as you, and he is eager to ma ke sure that you 
are s -- you are going to su
rvive. That creates a 
lifetime fr iendship. 
Q: What about the very mi nor c
ontact you™d had with Rose also, was that some thing that gave 
you a bit of hope for the future? 

A: Mm, I don™t [indecipherable] 

Q: I mean, you had lost a wife -- 

A: You had what? 

Q: You had lost your wife . 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
65 
 
Q: Was that something that at -- in 
some  part of your mi nd you hung onto also? 
A: I am not sure about it. I am not sure about th
at I was thinking at that point of a ma rriage, but 
that was unthinkable, incredib
le, you know?  It never entered 
her mi nd or my mi nd. But on the 
first day of liberation, I was out
side with Rome k and we saw 
her sister. I asked, ﬁWhe re™s 
Rushka? ﬂ  I asked. She said, ﬁWe have to take 
her from the barracks, 
she has typhoid, to the 
krankenhaus.ﬂ I said, ﬁI will go.ﬂ 
I will -- I had to crawl beforeI a -- was able to reach the 
barrack, she was already taken. I 
couldn™t walk there at that 
time too fast, you know, I had to 
crawl, you know, almost . So I didn™t see her. But 
I do believe -- I do believe 
that I saw her in the 
hospital four or five days late
r. I do believe in that, yes. 
Q: Go back just a bit in the 
-- the weeks before liberation, you
™re describing liberation that you 
have to crawl. Obviously you™ve deter 
-- your health has deteriorated, so -- 
A: Oh, of course. 
Q: -- what state of health were you in right befo
re liberation, and then sort of bring us up to 
liberation.  

A: I me ntioned to you that I had typhoid in Ausc
hwitz. There are two types of typhoids. I had the 
second type [indecipherable] had 
in Bergen-Belsen. My future wi
fe saved me . She wa s able to 
get hold of some  me dication and send it over to me . That helped me . 

Q: So in the weeks right before liberation, were
 you recovering from typhoid, or --what was your 
state of health? 

A: Before liberation? 

Q: A few weeks before. 

A: I am not sure that I reme mber wh
en I discovered that I have typhoid. 
Q: Oh, oh.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
66 
 
A: I am not sure. 
Q: Oh, it was after liberation that you had typhoid? 

A: No, before liberation. 

Q: Before, okay. 

A: Before liberation, 
but I cannot pinpoint. 
Q: We ll why -- why were you in such bad health 
that you had to crawl? Not why, but describe 
your state of health. 

A: Because -- because -- because I wa -- it wa
s ™45, I was exha usted, tired. My weight was 88 
pounds at the libera -- on the liberation, 88 pounds. 
I was weak, extremely weak from all those 
years. And of course I do believe that on liberat
ion day or two days -- a 
day later, I -- my typhoid 
disappeared. But I was extremely weak, weighing 88 pounds. 

Q: Well, what was it like to be in the camps, 
like the week before liberation, what were the 
Germans doing? 
A: It™s interesting. A day before
 liberation on April 14, one day before we were liberated, we all 
knew or felt or sensed that the war has come  to an
 end, that we are going to
 be liberated in a day 
or two. The Germans we re in a hurry. We  saw it that
 they are in a hurry, that they are trying to 
escape. And in the morning when we opened our 
eyes, we saw that the towers are empty, there 
are no SS men any more. And then we heard some  
shooting, artillery or some thing like this. In 

an hour or two -- hours later a singl
e tank rolled into the camp. And we heard -- and this was so 
reassuring, y-y-yo -- you are free. 
We  are here liberating you. I saw 
it, and I think that perhaps I 
was not sure that this is true, 
but in another tr -- ‚nother Eng
lish tank rolled in and I saw them 
distributing chocolate to people. 
That was a terrible mi stake, pe
ople were dying like flies, taking 
two pieces of chocolate, they couldn™t -- thei
r stomachs couldn™t take it, they were dying like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
67 
 
flies. Again my friend saved me . He did not let 
me take anything. And here I have to tell you a 
very interesting mo me nt at night he was afraid th
at the -- that the hunger w
ill -- will force me  to 
go out and take some  food that I 
cannot digest. He tied his feet 
with my feet all night long. I 
couldn't mo ve. He was much more experienced than I.
 We  were -- he tied with a rope my feet to 
his feet. This is what friendshi
p is all about. You care. You care
 for your friend as mu ch as you 
care for yourself, or more. 
Q: What -- what did you think and 
he think you were able to eat? 
A: Soup. 

Q: Just soup. 

A: He was constantly saying, take two soups, fi
ve soups, as ma ny as you want, but soup, a soup, 
a warm soup. And I followed his advice. 

Q: So what did you do when you realized there we
re no Germans in the tower?  There was about 
an hour before the firsttank. What did people do -- 
A: Something like this. 
Q: Okay, there was time . What did -- 

A: We  were -- we were waiting. 
We  knew that we -- we knew that
 some thing is happening. We  
were waiting. We  greeted those libe
rators as though they are angels
 from heaven. It was a lot of 
exciteme nt, euphoric. We  were all euphoric. But I 
have to me ntion here some thing. That feeling 
of happiness, after awhile, and I cannot pinpoint it
 to two weeks or four weeks or six weeks, 
completely faded away. All of a sudden, most of 
us es -- I, an-and I would say most of us felt 
that we cannot return to our homes. We have no fa
milies, but all those liberators will go back to 
United Kingdom, the United States, and -- a
nd live a norma l life, but we are alone. 
[indecipherable] we have to start from the begi
nning. What will I do? And how will I be able to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397  
68 
 
cope with that fact th
at I am alone, or only with one friend
?  That was a depressing feeling. Very 
strong, depressing feeling. And that lasted for awh
ile. But then, after that 
Rosensaft organized of 
com -- organized th-the -- all surv
ivors, we became  more active.
 That feeling was replaced by a 
belief that  we will manage. It was interesting also that most of the survivors, and of course 
including me, were trying to get 
married, to create life agai n. That was a --  a crucial point in our 
liberation, to prove to the world th
at we are going to bring life agai
n. And that we will be able to 
find a place, someplace, where we will be able to
 restor e life. And that
 what happened really. 
Those who were more courageous than I went to liv
e in Israel. The rest of
 us went to the United 
States. And having said that, I must express my fe
elings here, that people who are born here in 
the United St ates don™t appreciate at
 all what the United States is
 all about. We  do. We  do. We  -- 
I am -- I am all for the United Stat
es, it™s the greatest country that 
existed in all s 
-- all civilized 
life for the last two or 3000 years. We have to pr
eserve it. Why a m I expre
ssing it in such a -- in 
such an interview?  I guess because I need my 
children and grandchildren to know how I -- how I 
was in awe of the United States. Ma
ybe they will understand it too.  
Q: When we re you able to come  here?   
A: I came January 1951. 

Q: And in between your liberation? 

A: I don™t go to work on that. I st
ay home , I read hist -- Ame r ican
 history or the Bill of Rights, I 
don™t go to work on that day. This 
is for me  a day of celebration. 
Q: Oh, now you don™t go to work on that day? 

A: No, I don™t go to work on that day now, it™s a day of celebration and I sit home and I read 

American history or Bill of Rights, whatever -- 
whatever I can. But I never go to work on that 
day. This is not the way to wor -- 
not -- is not a day to work. This
 is a way -- a day to celebrate.

Q: And just briefly, after liber
ation, where are you relocated to
?  And I™m presuming that you™re 
able to stay with your friend and also Rose? 
A: Yeah, we were relocated -- 
the German -- the English armyburned the entire camp because it 
was infested and they had to burn all the barracks.
 And they transferred us
 -- they transferred us 
to where -- about three miles from the old ba
rracks and two German m
ilitary barracks. They 
were, of course, completely different. We  had 
the very nice room, there were restrooms around. 
And I lived, of course, with my friend in that ro
om, and Rose lived with her sister in another 

building not far from that building. I 
saw her every day, almost every day.

A: Probably at the end of 1940 -- to Rose -- or 
not to Rose, in December of 1945. Dec e mber of 
1945, I™m sorry. We  have one daughter, and we ha
ve adopted three child
ren. One child was the 
child of Rose™s sister , that she was able after th
e parents were taken to 
Auschwitz, Rose was able 
to bring her to a Polish family and she survived
 with that Polish fa mily. After the war, we 
brought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen
-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile. But 
there was a little problem. She wa
s so grateful to that Christian 
family that she was looking at us 
as people who are trying to take away her re
ligion. And it was very, very difficult. But in 1949, 
Rose and I went to Israel. I had so
me  fa mily in Israel from before
 the wa r, and Rose had a larger 
fa mily, two uncles, and she of course went with 
us. And here a dramatic change took place. All 
of a sudden she fell in love with 
the people in Israel and she didn't 
want to return. She wanted to 
live her life there. And she lives there, she™s 
ma rried, she has four children, we have how ma ny?  
Four, five [inaudible] -- 
we have nine grandchildren there. N
o, we have four grandchildren and -- 
and how ma ny did I say? 

Q: You said nine. 

A: Nine or ma ybe 10 gr eat-grandchildren, you know
. And we are very, ve ry attached to each 

other. We r -- I used to go twice a year with 
my wife to be with th
em for six, eight weeks 
some ti me s. At least six weeks. And we are, as I 
said, very close. I love
 my grandchildren, and I 
love my great-grandchildren very much. They come  
to the St ates and stay with me , a nd we have 

a ma rvelous time with them. Then, in 1966, some thing happened. Rose had a cousin in Buenos 

Aires in Argentina, and they, hus
band and wife were involved in 
a terrible automobile accident 
and got killed. A school friend of mi ne who lived 
in Buenos Aires called me  up and t old me  the 
story and he said, you have to come , because 
those are two children and nobody knows what to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0397

do with them. I will take care of. I went. I spen
t several weeks in Argentina. I had diffi culties 
communicating with them, but I was able to get so me visas for them to come to the United 
States. They were tourist visas. They came to 
the United Stat es and they stayed with me for 
awhile, and even though when I came to Buenos Ai
res their fr iends were trying to tell them -- 
their school friends that I came ma ybe to take ad
vantage of them. After they came to the States 
and lived with me  for a few weeks, I reme mber ta
king them to the airport because they had to go 
back to Argentina for me to get permanent visas. They were so afraid that maybe I will not get 

those permanent visas, they were holding my ha
nd in the airport and I re
assured them. And after 
-- and I don™t reme mber any more, maybe two or 
three months later, I got the visas and they 
came to live with us. I love them very dearly.I don™t ma ke any distinct
ion between my daughter 
and the rest of them. And they ma de me  proud of
 them. One is a professo
r -- assistant professor 
in Boston. He was first at BU, and now he™s in a 
different college. And one is a physician in -- in 
New Britain, who became the chief of neurology 
in the hospi tal. And the o -- his br other, 
extremely capable young ma n, who is
 -- wrote his story in a very moving way, and who gave us 
three grandchildren and the -- the younger son gave 
us also three grandchi
ldren, they come  very 
often, but really not often enough and we spend time  t
ogether. I try to -- to -- 
to direct them, or to 
show them t he right way of life a
nd I perhaps am successful, perhaps. 
Q: You speak about your grandchildren -- 

Q2: Give me one second. 

Q: You speak about your grandchild
ren and great-grandchildren -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- children, and you™re doing 
this interview today. What do 
you want them to know about 
Auschwitz, your experience?

A: I imagine in the begi nning that  I was reluctant,
 very much s o, for the last 45 or 50 years, to 
tell my story. But I am doing it today for them
. They should know the story. They should watch 
it and reme mber. I did not speak to
 them enough, or perhaps at all 
about my life in camps. Now, 
they will have a record, and to 
me  that is extreme l y important. 
Q: What was the relux -- reluctance? 

A: To talk to them?  I was reluctant to talk to
 anybody about it in the beginning. The ma in -- the 
feeling why not was based on a certain, if not arro
gance, but a certain feeling, what am I going to 
tell them, they don™t understand me  -- they
 don™t understand it anyhow
. On that feeling 
disappeared. And as you probably know, I was 
the national chairman of the Days of 
Re me mbrance, appointed by President Carter, an
d then the -- reappointed by President Reagan 
and Bush. I was the chairman of the -- of the --  forgot the name of that committee. Yes, dealing 

with the [indecipherable] of the future muse
um. I  was a me mber of the executive board, we 
worked very hard to ma ke sure that the world 
cannot forget, and I became
 the national chairman 
of Days of Re me mbrance. That first year I re
ported to the council that 
I was able to convince 
three governors, the governor of Connecticut, Ne
w York and New Jersey to have Days of 
Reme mbrance in their capitals and invite -- and i
nvite all the [indecipherable] and people to -- to 
be present and to reme mber the 
Holocaust, lighting candles. When 
I reported it, I got a standi ng 
ovation. The next year, and I don™t reme mber the 
numbers any more, I probably reported 10 or 
12. After four or five years I reported, I have ev
ery state having Days of Re me mbrance in their 
capitals. I have mai -- ma in cities. I don™t 
remember -- don™t reme mber how many cities doing 
exactly the same  thing. I was very, very proud -- I am very, very proud of -- of accompl i shing 

what I have accomplished. If I spent too much tim
e, for me  I did not. But I -- perhaps for my 
fa mily I was too -- too many days away. I was in
 Washington very, very 
often, ma ybe five, six

days a month in Wa shington, and traveling to -- to
 o -- other states and ma king sure that there 
[indecipherable] done properly. But this is a lega
cy that I am leaving, leaving for my c hildren 
and grandchildren, never to forget, to 
get involved in the cause of me mory. 
Q: Thank you very much. 

A: Thank you very much for listening to me . Th
ank you all. When I came to the United States, 
my aunt, the sister of my  mother™s
, had that picture. It was sent to
 her before the war. My parents 
are here, young, and to me  they l
ook beautiful. I keep that pictur
e in my room, to look at it 
whenever I am there, and I revive memories looki
ng at that picture. It™s
 very helpful. That 
pictur e I rece ived in Israel from my sister™s fr
iends. She had a -- she had quite a few friends, and 
I am not sure why my sister se
nt the pictur e to Israel. I was 
thinking many times that maybe she 
was thinking of going there, and she sent the pict
ure to get her some papers or something like 
this, but I am not positi
ve, I really don™t know. 
Q: Are those the only two photogr
aphs you have of your fa mi ly? 
A: Yes.
