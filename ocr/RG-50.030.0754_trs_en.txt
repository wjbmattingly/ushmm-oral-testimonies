A: I would say middle class, they were not
 very well-to-do, but they  were not Œ I 
mean, they had a little house, you know, sort
 of a Œ very closely in almost like row 
houses in that little Œ little Œ very ancient 
town. And they were Œ they were fine, but 
they were not Œ I would not say 
they Œ they were well-to-do. 
Q: What about your Œ 
A: My grandparents on my mother™s side 
I think were a little 
bit better off. My 
grandfather on that side
 had a Œ and a Œ and a 
[indecipherable]
 he made brandy. 
Q: Wow. 

A: And I enjoyed visiting them
, and th ey Œ they Œ they  di
d, I think, pretty well. 
They  had Œ they had the 
[indecipherable]
 where they lived, and it was a really 
fascinating place. I was very disappointed
 after the war to find that had been 
bombed, and it co Œ there was nothing left of
 their house or their factory, wh atever 
you™d want to call it, and ev er
ything had co mp letely changed. 
Q: Tell me, where Œ where were they
? Were they in 
the same villag e? 
A: They went 
Bingen am Rhein
, not far.

Q: The one you were named after? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay , okay. 
A: And strangely  enough, I was bo
rn ex actly on his 
birthday, so Œ 
Q: That™s quite a coincidence. 
A: So, when my Œ I don™t kn
ow exactly how my dad and mo
ther met, but they were 
very much in love, and th
ey married in 1923, I be
lieve, and honeymooned in 
Heligoland
, and I think I was conceived there, 
because I Œ they were married in 
August, and I was born the next June second. 

Q: Yeah. So 
Heligoland
, where is that? Tell me 
[indecipherable]
 
A: It™s an island, I 
think in the Œ in the 
North Sea
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I™m not a hundred percent sure of that. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Never been there, but I heard a lot 
about it, it was a v ery favorite place for 
honeymoons at that time. 
Q: Oh, th e 
Niagara Falls
 of 
Germany
, then. 
A: Exactly. 

Q: So, do you have an
y earliest memories Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ as a small child? 

A: I Œ I think so, because I Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ it™s hard sometimes to tell w h at Œ wh
at Œ what do you remember, what were 
you told . 

Q: Yes. 
A: But I remember vaguely my
 mo  Œ wh en Œ that my  brother came home, and very  
short Œ wh-w hen he was very small baby, he
 had some kind of infection on his face, 
which became a sept Œ septicemia, a bl
ood poisoning. And he
 had to have an 
operation. I don™t know exactly
 what they  did, I guess just maybe drained th e Œ the 
Œ the sore that he had that was infected. 
And lu-luckily  he survived , because that 
was almo st always fatal. Had a big scar on 
Œ that never totally disappeared. It was Œ 
Q: Oh really? 
A: And he still has a little bit of 
that. But the Œ he was fine, and Œ 
Q: Why does that stick in your memo ry? 
A: Œ I remember that Œ pardon? 
Q: Why do you think th at 
sticks in your memory?

A: Well, again, I Œ I don™t Œ I think it Œ 
it was dra-dramatic, and Œ and it may have 
been Œ it maybe have been really mo re b
een told to me than
 Œ than I really 
remember. But I think 
I remember Œ think that I Œ when
 I was three Œ se Œ three or 
four years old. We had, I th
ink Œ this, don™t forget was 
Œ I was born in ™24, so we 
had a Œ our Œ our childhood were really qu
ite happy. My parents were well off. We 
had Œ we lived in a beautiful
, huge apartment in this Œ 
Q: Oh, describe it to me. 
A: It had two or three bedrooms, it had at
 least one bathroom, I Œ may have been  
two, I don™t reme mb er. And I Œ or at
 least a separate toilet. A Œ and 
hamzimmer
(ph), a Œ a what would call it? 
Q: 
Hanzimmer
(ph)? 
A: 
Hanzimmer
(ph), a salon, a Œ 
Q: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sort
 of a living room or a Œ 
A: Living room. 
Q: Œ meeting room. 
A: Œ wh ich was very large, and a dining room. Something called a 

[indecipherable]
, which was really a place where my parents got dressed in their Œ 
off their bedroom. And master bedroom, 
and I think two Œ two other bedrooms, and 

 
Interv iew with Eric Simo n 
 
 
June 21, 2014 
 

 
 
11
my  brother and I usually shared a bedr
oom. I think the other bedroom was made 
into a study or something. 
Q: And wha Œ 
A: But it was very large and it was very b
eautiful and we had a balcony, and was a 
quiet street. 
Q: It sounds like a 19
th
 century kind of building. 
A: Yes, it Œ it Œ I mean Œ and Œ and my  gr
an dfather owned that apartment building, 
so my  dad and my  uncle ow
ned Œ owned th e whole thing even tually. And it was qui 

Œ a nice place for the children to play, ri
de their tricycles and bicycles and Œ 

Q: Where would you do th at? In the 
courtyard? Was there a courtyard? 
A: Or even on the street, becau
se there wasn™t a whole lot of
 traffic. So this was my 
early childhood and the next major thi
ng I remember, an d we can go back if 
something comes up from a question, was when
 I was about six, seven years old, I 
developed on my  left eye, I believe it wa
s, a Œ what looked like a Œ a serious 
infection or some inflammation, where I 
had a drooping li-lid, and it looked very 
angry. An d my  parents took me to an eye doctor in 
Wiesbaden
, of all Œ of all 
names, Dr. 
Goering
. 
Q: Oh, good God. 

A: He was a cousin or some
thing of the field marshal.

Q: Really? 
A: And he came out with a cockamamie diagnosis of 
TB 
of the eye. 
Q: Tuberculosis of the eye. 
A: And my parents got Œ yeah, I don™t even  know if that exists. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But my  parents got scared
 enough so they sent me 
fo r the entire Œ when I was 
about seven years old, fo
r the entire winter to a 
kinderheim
, which I guess 
translates b est to a 
chi-children™s camp Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ in 
Samaden
(ph), 
Switzerla n d
, a village right outside of 
Saint Moritz
. 
Q: Well, that™s not bad. 

A: No, it isn™t bad except I was so homesick I couldn™t enjoy it. 

Q: Of course, of course. 

A: That time I think I was 
even without my brother, an
d I was there from before 
Christmas til after Easter, and I just cried 
my self to sleep many nights. Didn™t really 
appreciate, as I did la-later on, as I will tell you in a minute. So I was there for a 

very long time, the idea was th
at the mountain air is good for 
TB
. And th e 
following year they send me back again, I 
think also for most of the winter, to 
another Œ but this one Œ this Œ this one
 time was a much more pleasant, Jewish

kinderheim
 in 
Celerina
, which is the town between 
Samadan
(ph), or 
Samadan
(ph), and 
Saint Moritz
. And that time I had my brother with me, an-and I 
was a little older and I had a very good tim
e, and I learned how to ski. I mean, I 
learned the rudimentary Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ aspects of it, snowplows and Œ and m-
my  dad came to visit, and show you how 
brothers can differ, I said Œ I ju Œ I was st
arting to  run into his arms because I was 
so happy to see him, and my  brother said, 
no, first we™re gonna finish the sled ride 
down the mountain 
[indecipherable]
. But we had a wonderful time Œ 
Q: Kids are like that. 
A: Œ seeing him, we still enjoyed seeing him. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And Œ and th at was actu
ally a very interesting Œ 
Q: So th is was Œ 
A: Œ experience. 
Q: Were you very  close to your 
brother from the very beginning?  
A: Oh yes, we Œ you know, we had our fi
ghts, as most childre
n, especially that 
close, two boys do. Bu t we were always ve
ry  close, we Œ we ch Œ shared a bedroom 
and we Œ we couldn™t go to  sleep without saying

Q: Oh, that™s sweet, th at really is. 
A: Right. So, and then I really became very
 interested in winter sports, and I Œ my  
dad, and then following when Œ as I be
came a little older, like 10 - 11, my dad to-
took me with him. My par Œ my parents 
took separate vacations
. I haven™t told you 
much about the business Œ 
Q: No. 

A: Œ but Œ 
Q: I™d like to know about ma Œ 
A: Œ  my  mo th er en jo yed  wo
rking in the business. So 
she was basic ally office 
manager, bookkeeper, accountant, whatever, 
and in-in the Œ in the Œ in Œ in the 
[indecipherable]
 which was in our building, so 
she didn™t have to go an ywhere. 
But they  didn™t take vacation together, so
mebody had to be there for the business, 
so  th ey  Œ  my  mo th er wen t  w
ith his sister, my  dad went 
pretty mu ch by himself, but 
met some  people he knew 
that came every year in 
Saint Moritz
. 
Q: Oh, so is that Œ was that Œ 

A: So at that time it w asn™t quite as Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ as fa Œ posh as it is now, but it was s
till a beautiful resort, and he took me with 
him for Œ from Œ I guess from the time Œ from 
what, 11 to 13. Thir
teen was in 1937, 

 
Interv iew with Eric Simo n

and it was the last time we were able to go to 
Switzerland
. No w, my  dad waited a 
long time, and I™ll explain that, to
 emigrate, and I™ll explain that Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ very carefully. But he clearly knew 
it was coming, because one of the reasons 
for going on all these vacations wa
s that Œ to smuggle money out of 
Germany
. 
Q: Oh really? 
A: Abso lutely, he started that 
very early. He would go to 
Switzerland
 Œ first of all, 
you had Œ the Germans gave 
you a certain amount of fore
ign money, they allowed 
you a certain amount of money to change 
to Œ so let™s say in the case of Swiss 
francs, or Dutch guilder, you had a couple 
of thousand dollars, whatever it was, he 
would live in a little cheaper hotel, sa
ve some money, put it in a bank in 
Switzerland 
or 
Holland
, 
Belgium
, wherever we went. He also took along a 
[indecipherable]
 or contacts, and sold it there. In
 addition, I found out later they 
bought a row house in 
Philadelphia
. So Œ 
Q: Did th ey? Even  befo re coming here? 

A: They really in Œ in
 the fi Œ the idea that we may go there, and we Œ or go to th e 
United States
. And so they Œ they were really 
quite foresighted in that sense. 
Q: Yeah, it™s true, it™s true, because many people Œ 

A: Right.

Q: Œ didn™t know wh ere to go, or how. 
A: Yeah, but he didn™t even apply for a Œ fo
r a visa, but I™ll explain that in a mi nute. 
S o  my  mo th er was ma d e  Œ  main ly in  th e bu
siness, so she hired a both some Œ some 
help in th e kitchen, and you 
know, like a Œ a maid Œ a maid. 
Q: You anticipated one of my  questions, yes. 

A: But she also, from time 
to time hired a nursemai
d for Œ for the two boys. 
Q: Okay. That™s one thing I wanted to ask, 
is whether she had any help in the house. 
A: Oh, absolutely Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ since she ur Œ work ed qu
ite a bit. She almost always had a maid, as long as we 
were allowed to have them. And from time 
to time quite often ha
d also, at least on 
weekends, a nursemaid for us. 

Q: So were these people Œ we
re they Œ did they  change a 
lot, or did you have people 
come help her and Œ and th -that became pa
rt of the family? Wh at kind of relation 
did you have with this Œ 

A: I-In the beginning, yeah. Ea
rly on, as they were ther
e quite a long time and Œ and 
became sort of a part of the family , I mean
, really Œ even had Ch
ristmas trees for the 
maids, which we enjoyed too, at Christma
stime. Later o n , of course, these things 
changed a lot. When the 
Nuremberg
 laws came out, we had to have a maid over 

 
Interv iew with Eric Simo n 
 
 
June 21, 2014 
 

 
 
17
say 55 years old, and wa Œ wh ile the lady 
was very nice, we never became that 
close. But I had, I-I remember, at least 
one young woman that took care of us on 
weekends when we were already a little ol
der, when I was maybe 10 or 11, and my 
brother was a year and a half younger, 
whom I had a terrible crush on. Sh e was 
very, very  pretty. An d so the reason my  par 
Œ well, first of all, let me say something 
about the times. 
Q: Yes. 
A: We Œ it was Œ as soon as the Nazis ca
me to power, things did change pretty 
quick ly. 
Q: How? Ho w did Œ did it Œ 
how did it affect your life? 
I mean, the Œ your family™s 
life, not just yours. 

A: Actually, you know, clearly not as much
 as it did later on, but very quickly we 
couldn™t go to our swimming pool, our favo
rite swimmi ng pool. We couldn™t go Œ 
my  Œ my  dad belonged  to a 
luft bad Œ 
Q: So, a 
luft bad
. 
A: Œ wh ich was basically the German equiva
lent of an all male nudist colony. They  
went there to walk around in the n
ude and take sun bath s in the nude. 

Q: Right. 
A: And they  couldn™t over Œ over
 there. There were Œ were signs

Q: Jews are not allowed, y
eah, not allowed in Œ not Œ 
A: All over, yeah, also some of th
e mu Œ movie theaters and theaters. 
Q: And that was pretty soon after the Œ 
A: Even some park benches, I don™t reme
mb er for sure whether Œ if that was the 
case in 
Wiesbaden
. But, I mean, those things became evident.  

Q: So, that soon afte
r ™33? I mean, soon Œ 
A: Very soon, I would say Œ 
Q: So you were nine years old Œ 
A: Œ ™34 - ™35. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And they made it more and more difficult for my  dad to operate his business. He 
had a l Œ a Œ an 
[indecipherable]
 and wholesale grain busine
ss. He Œ he bought and 
sold, and he he had a Œ a 
Œ wh at do you call it, a Œ 

Q: A tire, a towel, a si Œ excuse me, a silo? 
A: Not exact silo, a Œ a warehouse with 
a thing where you Œ 
wh ere you can put Œ 
put Œ put the grain through into  sacks and a
ll Œ and all sorts of Œ even, I think, some 
milling. And this warehouse was taken away
 from him, and what 
we found out later 
is, it became a Œ an arms depot Œ 
Q: Really? 

 
Interv iew with Eric Simo n 
 
 
June 21, 2014 
 

 
 
19
A: Œ for the Nazis. And my  dad went and 
to ok a picture of that warehouse, not 
knowing it was an arms depot, I don™t thi
nk he knew, and was immediately hauled 
in by the Gestapo, and questioned and told  
he was not allowed to take pictures at 
this. But they let him go that time. 

Q: So this is after it™
s taken away  from him?  

A: Yes, that was probably about ™36 - ™3
7. Between ™36 - ™37, I don™t remember 
exactly what year. And then, of course, 
it became more and mo
re difficult for him 
to do any business. Luckily, he had savings, 
so he was able to live from about ™36 to 
Œ until the end of ™38, when we emigrated to 
United States
 Œ 
Q: That™s actually Œ yeah. 
A: Œ and had enough left over for us to liv
e a few months before he started to work 
there. But things got more and more difficu
lt. If Œ if a Jewish ha
d wanted to go to a 
gymnasium, there was a quota. And my  
parents wanted to send me to the 
orangienstrasse
(ph) gymnasium, I forg
et, they had a form 
real
 gymnasium, 
something like that, and they co
uldn™t get in. But I got into the 
Gutenberg
 
gymnasium, which was a 
humanistisch
 gymnasium and a 
real
 gymnasium. About 
the only difference between the huma
nistic part and the Œ and the 
rea l
 part was that 
in humanistic part you took Greek as a se
cond, after Latin Œ after Latin and French , 
then Greek, and the other one you took La
tin, French and then English. And I went

to the 
real 
part of it, and well, only about, I wo
uld say six Jewish boys Œ this was an 
all boys™ school, and I believe there may have
 been a girl Œ separate girl gymnasium 
as well, six or seven Jewish

about my being in  a Œ in a school with so 
few Jewish children. And of course, I 
noticed the discrimination not from the 

children, but from the higher 
ups, immediate Œ very , very
 Œ very quickly. I was a 
pretty good soccer player, and was what y
ou would call now a striker. And together 
with the center, whose name was 
Krempel

scored a lot of goals. And one day my  Œ th

in the goal, because 
you™re not going to 
be playing in  the interschool game, becaus
e you™re Jewish. And 
then I played goal 
for a while, and then I was out altoge
th er. And the other time I was very 
uncomfortable is, they taught religion in 
school. So couple times I w ent along with

I™d Œ I was embarrassed to drop out. And 
then th-the Œ our synagogue, the

back and ask so mething 
I didn™t before. And 
that is, I™d like you to tell me a little bit about your parents™ personalities. Your 
father™s personality, his Œ whether he wa
s open or gregarious, or more reti Œ 
reticent, or whatever. 

A: Okay, my Œ my father was extr
emely gre-gregarious and outgoing.

A: He had a wonderful personality, and that
™s why he was a very good salesman,

and was able to start a totally different bus
in ess in this country  and do well. He was 
in the lighting business when  he came ove
r here, which he knew nothing about. But 
he had such a great personality that ever
ybody liked him and b
ought from him. And 
he Œ he was very outg oing an
d very Œ loved people. My  mo
ther was mo re Œ also had 
a very nice personality, but she was much 
more reserved Œ while he was around 
especially, she kind 
of took the background, as was 
customary in German society. 
And once he passed away, she just kind of 
came out of her shell and became mu ch 
mo re outgoing and more enterprising, and Œ 
Q: That™s already here, in the 
United States
? 
A: That was already here in the 
United States

Q: Okay . Who was the Œ 
A: But they Œ they ha 
Œ they were very lovely people, and I think 
Irene

that.  

Q: Yeah. 
Irene
 is your wife. 
A: My wife. 

Q: Yes. What were their Œ what were the 
things that were important to them? In 
other wo rds, what kind of values did th
ey  hold that Œ that you could observe and 
then also choose to either
 make your own, or not?

A: It™s Œ it™s a hard question to answer. 
I think they had very
 good values, as I 
mentioned before, they  don™t Œ didn™t have a 
lot of formal educatio
n, but they really 
acted as though they  were highly educated 
people. They read a lot, th Œ education 
was a number one issue. And especially for 
my  dad, vacations were very important. 
He felt that was a very important part of
 life, and also he had so-some health 
problems. Lot of lower back pain , high bl
ood pressure and so  he felt he needed a 
vacation also for health reasons, but he 
loved vacations; whether it was skiing or 
whether it was in the summer, hiking, he 
loved go Œ an -and I kind of inhe Œ 
inherited that. 
Q: Well, that™s a good thing, 
because you know, here in our
 society, people say we 
don™t have enough balance in our lives. 

A: Abso lutely, absolutely. 
We™ve always, my family, 
Irene
 and I and our kids have 
always had wonderful vacations togeth er. 
Of course now it™s Œ becomes mu ch mo re 
difficult to go as a family, but we still 
try to Œ to travel when we can. 
Q: Were they Œ you mentioned that they we
re worried when all of
 these things were 
happening, when  
Hitler
 came to power, when his business were Œ was affected. 
And you mentioned also that other people 
fell into a depression, and some others 
would commit suicide because of

e types of stresses in their  pers Œ were 
they basically optimistic people? 

A: Yes, I would Œ I would say that. They  
were Œ they were optimistic people and 
that™s why I wanted to come back 
to it, why did we leave so late? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: My parents were very, very attached to
 their parents and very family oriented. 
That™s another ver Œ very important value. 
And my  grandfather sa
id point blank, we 
were born here, we™re gonna die 
here, we™re not going anywhere. 
Q: This is your mo th er™s father, or your father™s father? 
A: Both of them. 

Q: Both of them. 

A: Both  of them. And they 
were not gonna leave them. 
Now, as I mentioned, my  
dad was fa-farsighted enough to  
[indeciphera ble]
 money, to Œ I™m sorry, to Œ to 

move out money to  other countries to have 
something when he left. But he also, in 
1936, made a 
orientierungsreise
, an orientation trip to the 
United States
. 
Q: Oh, did he?

around, an d wanted to  see what could 
do in  Œ in a new country , with a new 
language, with a new culture. 
Q: Where did she live? 

A: She lived in 
Clev eland
,
 Ohio
, where we ended up. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And a lovely lady Œ we 
were Œ our lives were really
 saved by th e fact that my 
grandmother™s brother had enough sense to leave 
Germany
 in the late 19 hund Œ 
1800s, move to the 
United States
, and this was his daughter, who Œ a very 
generous, lovely  lady who ga
ve affidavits to somethi
ng like 15 relatives. And you 
know, if any of them had been bad apples, 
she could have been in serious trouble. 
She was well-off, she had no children and 
[indecipherable]
 husband, and she had 
good Œ good positions. And sh
e was well-off, but she was not really wealthy, and so 
this is an hero Œ courageous thing to do.
 But my  dad came over here and then  came 
back and we still didn™t leave. That was lik
e two years before we actually left. And

Th-They had a real attack on her house. 
And Œ so we didn™t have that, but the

mother said, come

Q: Yeah.

A: Œ and so I went to the car. And it tu

because he had heard of friends being 
picked up by the Gestapo and put in 
concen tration camps that day. They picked
 up many, many ab le-bodied Jewish men. 
They did Œ they left the women a

ow of people disappearing befo re 
Kristallnacht

of somebody being arrested Œ 

A: Oh yes, absolutely
. I mean, people were arrested fo
r all kinds of th ings. We had, 
for instance, a friend who Œ who was arrest
ed and put in concen tration camp  for 

rassenschande
, wh ich is, he was dating Œ he was 
supposed to be dating a Ch ristian 
woman, or maybe he was married to a Ch
ristian woman, I don™t recall. You know, 
this was a Œ a doctor friend, if I remember  co rrectly, who was put in a concentration 
camp because he was seen with a Christia
n woman. Now, they finally let him go, 
but he was pretty emaciated, and ill when 
he got out. Now abso
lutely, there were 
people arrested for all kinds of reasons
, or Œ or drummed up reasons. And some 
were let go, and some were not so fortuna
te. So the question of ca Œ disappearing to  
c Œ to concentration camps, that was already going around fo r quite a while.

A: And I really don™t recall. I don™t have 
a really good sense of the years. But my 
parents, as I said, got some restitu tion for 
the apartment house th
ey shared with my 
aunt and uncle. And I think 
for some other things. I want
ed to get Œ get restitution 
for interruption of education. Now, I didn™t 
have a lot of interruption, but I did have 

interruption. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And most of my friends, including my 
brother, got the restitution. It was like a 
thousand marks or 2,000 ma
rks. And I got a letter from 
Wiesbaden
 saying I should 
be grateful that I was Jewish, otherwise 
I would end up in the German army, and 
who knows where I would be. And besides, I have a 
PhD
 degree. What am I 
complaining about? 

Q: Oh my God. 

A: So I went to court, and lost. And once 
you lose in the local court, you have to go 
to a court of appeals, where you have to 
pay a percentage, or a Œ actually have to 
pay a Œ not a percentage, you have to pay 
a fee to the lawyer, and even the lawyer 
said, don™t gamb le 20 percent of what you mi
ght get, for the fact that you might get, 
because you might not get it. And so we ga
ve it up. And then wh
en Œ when Œ when 
the people who got the restitution for th
e interruption of education got a second 

round Œ of course, I didn™t get the second ro
und, because I didn™t 
get the first round.

whole premise that I should be Œ 
Q: Grateful. 
A: Œ write a thank you note to

 somebody would have had the audacity  in the postwar

di Œ in general it was a very good

I Œ it didn™t bother me too mu

even though I had

We were invited back to germ Œ to

 be able to do. And the

believe that was before Œ or after, I™m not 
sure. But anyway, th e Œ he mentioned to me 
that he had a so Œ given them a list of 
books to read. And the kids

called 
[speaks German]
. It was by a German boy, non-Jewish boy called 
Friedisch
(ph) Œ I believe it was 
Friedisch
(ph). I think he was th
e Œ the Gentile boy, 
who lived in the same apartm
ent build ing with a family that had a Jewish boy his 
age, and they became very, very close frie
nds. I read that book in one night, it was 
an incredible book. And it gave the Œ the Jewish situation in 
Germany
 from the 
point of view  of this Ch ristian boy with 
Œ who had th is close Jewish friend. And th e 
one scene I reme mb er so vividly, is the 
Christian dad talking with the Jewish dad 
and saying, why don™t you get 
out of here? Y-You see that they™re not very nice to 
you and that it could get worse Œ 
Q: Worse. 
A: Œ and mo re dangerous, and leave. Take
 your family with you. And the Jewish 
dad said look, if this were the Middle Ages
, and I would have to fear for my life, I 
would leave tomorrow. But this is 
Germany
 in the 20
th
 century, a civ ilized country. 
I don™t have to fear for 
my life, an d eventually 
Hitler
 will be gone and things will 
be normal again. This was such a common Œ 
Q: Refrain. 

A: Œ frame of mind for Œ for Jewish peopl
e. Whether they believed it or not, they 
certainly rationalized that Œ 
that they would Œ nobody w
ould harm them physically, 
because it was a civilized coun try. And to some extent my parents, I™m sure u sed

that argument as well. But it was really stri
ke Œ and we discussed that book wh en I 
spoke to the class, and of course they 
asked me questions about my  experiences. 
Q: Was there anything that they said in 
those discussions that 
also stay with you? 
A: One thing stayed with me is that I real
ly couldn™t answer very well, and when a Œ 
a boy said, we™re paying restitution to our fo
rmer Jewish citizens, who were clearly 
badly hurt. But why should we, the third ge
neration, wh o had nothing to do with 
this, why should we 
Œ should we pay this? And I didn
™t have a good answer. I don™t 
remember what I said. You can argue this 
both  ways, you could say look, your gra Œ 
your gran dparents did this, 
and so our Œ some of your 
grandparents, and so you™re 
still paying for what they did, ju st as 
Œ as in this country  some people are 
advocating restitution for the slaves. A
nd we™re certainly not responsible for 
slavery. And some argue that they™re rea
lly not guilty. They Œ 
they weren™t born. 
Something that™s very difficult to Œ 
Q: For you to come down 
on one side or the other? 
A: Right. Exactly, exactly. 

Q: Well, tell me a little bit about Œ I m

certain topics, but this sounds like an appr

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I understand perfectly. And especially when if you were in a concentration 
camp, or you were close to 
being gassed, or you have re

I could to tally understand. 
But having not had these horri
ble experien ces, I would Œ 
didn™t feel quite that strong
ly, but it took me a very long
 time to want to go back . 
Q: Did it really? 

A: It did. When we finally were invited b
ack, I think that was th
e first time we went 
to 
Germany
. No, we were there once befo
re. I was on a sabbatical in 
Paris
, and I 
took my family to 
Wiesbaden
 to see where I grew up. 
Q: But that would have been 
[indecipherable]
 
A: We were very uncomfortable, because 
we didn™t know anybody, and the kids 
even were uncomfortable, and 
so we stayed about a day 
or two days and drove to 
Basel
 and went to 
Switzerland
. Well, when I was invited back, it was already the 
third generation. The second generation wa
s terrible. In other words, the people 
who were the children of the 
people who did some of th
ese things, were t Œ didn™t 
want to talk about it. They were emba
rrassed , they were ashamed, and they 
wouldn™t bring it up in school. The Holo cau
st simply wasn™t discussed. And we, of 
course, resented that.

Q: Yeah. 
A: But the third generation was totally diffe
rent. They  wanted to know th e answers, 
they wanted  to ask questions, they want
ed to know what happened . How Œ how 
were their families involved and not involv ed
. So that was something that made me 
feel that it™s time to forg
ive these chil Œ these child

basically nothing to  do with it. They migh
t be in Œ I might have parents who anti-
Semitic Œ who brainwashed th
em, that I can™t Œ but I can™t exclude that in any 
country. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I felt that this generation deserved
 at least a little bit 
more of an Œ of a 
rapprochement than the previous genera
tions. And that™s why I was willing to go 
there, and went back  for scientific pur
poses. In other words, for visiting fellow 
scientists in 
Germany
, for going to ger Œ meetings in 
Germany
. In fact, my first 
visit to 
Berlin
 was for a scientific meeting, maybe
 10 years ago or something, first 
time

A: I™m quite sure. So it was

A: Fifty or 60 years after I left. Yes, 
because by th at time the people who Œ who 
purp Œ perpetrated all this were ei
-either dead or extremely old. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The second generation was also getting 
older and the third ge
neration really was 
making an attempt to know and to
 make up for what happened. 
Q: When  you talk ab out the second generati
on, is that what you experienced when  
you went back to 
Germ any
? That first time was a family visit. 
A: Actually, not directly, too much.  
Q: Okay .

courses, but I audited biochemistry. And I

enjoy reading the literature. I mean, I woul

 that got flabby muscles by not eating 

enough vitamin 
E

E 
deficiency. And we made some interesting 
discoveries in that area. But I didn™t stay

how does the brain react to opiate, what do 
Œ what do they do wh
en they get there. 
And the major be Œ discovery  we made wa
s discover the so-called opiate rezept Œ 
receptors in the brain. 
Q: Tell me a little bit about that. 
A: These are protein molecules Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ to which these drugs mu st bind in  or
der to perform what 
they perform, namely 
Œ 

Q: The high? 

A: The highs, the lows an-and you know, 
the dysphoria in some cases. The pain  
relief. All the things they 
do, they do many things. Th
e respiratory depression, 
which kills you within Œ when
 you get Œ when you have 
an overdose. All these can 
only be done Œ can only  happen if the drug 
binds to the opiate receptors, to these 
protein mo lecules. 
Q: And is it ams Œ in my very layman™s terms, because as I Œ 
A: Sure. 

Q: Œ said before our intervie

A: Right, may Œ you™re not a scientist.

Q: Does this mean that the discovery was 
how the drugs actually affect the brain in 
its Œ in Œ in its most Œ 
A: Yes. Yes, and how it affects,
 on a basic biochemical level. 
Q: Right, okay. 

A: It binds to this molecule called the receptor. 

Q: Right. 

A: As we call it, the receptor Œ and by th
e way, just to be fair, there was three 
laboratories that made the discovery si-simultaneously. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. One was 
Pert 
and 
Snyder
 at 
Hopkins
, 
Johns Hopkins
. One was a very 
nice gentleman at 
U-Uppsala
, 
Sweden
, called 
Lars Terenius
, and my  lab. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And a little bit better than a year later,
 maybe two years later Œ yeah, that was in 
™73, a group in 
Scotland
, but also a German Jewish refugee, 
Hans Kosterlitz 
and 
his 
[indecipherable]
 
John Hughes
 discovered the endorphins, the substance in the 
brain for wh ich th-the receptors were ther
e. They were not th
ere for people who 
shoot up heroin, or take morphine for pa
in; they were there 
for the su-substance 
which we call er Œ endorphins. 
Q: Right.

discover the substances, but I named them

Q: I™m impressed. 
A: Œ a dollar for every time it™s used. 
Q: That would be not bad. 

A: No, it wouldn™t, no. 

Q: That would be not bad at all. 
A: At any rate, and that Œ well we Œ we di
d a great deal of work on what™s called 
signal transduction, which means what happ
ens between the time these drugs, or the 
endorphins, bind to the recepto
rs in the time the drug is abused  or euphoria happens, 
a high happens, or pain is relieved.  
Q: Okay . 

A: And while we still don™t know th e whole 
story, we know a great deal of what 
some of the biochemical steps are between
 the binding of these drugs, or the 
endorphins and subsequent even ts. 

Q: You mentioned earlier that 
your Œ you would have wanted
 to  be a doctor. Is that 
something th at you knew th

them I never took. I never took a course 
in histology. I never to ok a course in anatomy. I had to  learn it Œ all my

would have been good to have

A: Do you ha

Q: Questions that I wanted 
to fo llow up on and so rt of 
like to tie up loose ends from 
the beginning. You™ve menti
oned that when  you were a 
young boy, and during one 
of the trips to 
Switzerland
 with your father, you stay
ed at a kosher hotel because 
you wanted to be a rabbi. And tell me, what
 was it about being a rabbi that attracted 

you? That Œ that Œ what appealed? 
Q: That™s a difficult question to answer,except I Œ I was impressed with our rabbi, 
Rabbi 
Paul La-La-Lazarus
(ph) in 
Wiesbaden
 who Œ who sp oke at my  Œ who Œ 
who Bar Mitzvahed me essentially, taught
 me my lessons Œ some of my Bar 
Mitzvah lessons and gave the Œ the sermon,
 and he was a very good speaker, and I 
admired him a great d eal. That may have 
had a lot to Œ and I went through a Œ a 

religious period in my life, which for better 
or for worse, disappeared  pretty quickly 
after I found out about the Holocaust. 
Q: Well, here was a question, yes, do y
ou co nsider yourself religious today?

 positive, cultural Jew, a-and ethnic Jew. 
I™m very proud of anything that the Jewish
 community does that
 I like, whether it™s 
sports or science or me dicine or anything.
 And I Œ I Œ I like to belong to a Jewish 
congregation because it gives me a feeling of
 belonging. As for a 
belief in God, I™m 
afraid that™s gone. I wish I did. It woul
d make life mu ch easier, would make dying 
much easier. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But I can™t believe in it personally. I me
an, I Œ I can believe in a Œ in a Œ some 
kind of super power. I cannot believe in a personal God th at would answer que Œ 
prayers or punish you or re
ward you. Simply, the evid
ence is not there. So Œ 
Q: Thank you. 

A: Œ maybe I shouldn™t have said this, but Œ 

Q: No, no, I asked, I asked. 

A: Œ this is how I feel. So then that Œ th
at idea. And then of course, I got excited 
about science, so that kind
 of went by the wayside.

So i-it™s Œ it™s been a very, very, very 
gratifying to ha Œ be recogn

been very generous. In 2005
 they  did an all-day symposium in my  honor. Oh , by the 
way, in 1997, I believe, a journal called 
Neurochemica l
 
Research
 did a Œ a whole 
volume in my  honor, with my  picture 
with an article by a colleague, Dr. 
Huda
(ph) 
Akeel
(ph), a Syrian born, lovely 
lady with the University of 
Mich igan
, who wrote 
an article about why I deserved the hono
r. And in  the Œ the s-symposium at my 
university was Œ all day symposium with 
very outstanding pe
ople lecturing and 
saying nice things about me. And then about 
two or thr Œ three or four years ago, 
the medical school set up a annual lecture, called the 
Eric Simon

far, thank goodness, it™s not in memorial, 
it™s in my honor. Bu
