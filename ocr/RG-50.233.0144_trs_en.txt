Interview with Frances Za tz 
April 9, 1992 
North Wood me re, New York 
 
     

Q: Today is April 9, 1992, I am Anthony Di 
Iorio and I am at the home of Mrs. 
Frances Zatz of North Woodme re, New Yor
k.  I am here on behalf of the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum to in
terview Mrs. Zatz about her experiences 
during the Holocaust.  Good morning.   
 

A:Goodmorning.   

 

Q: Where were you born? 

 

A: I was born in Wa rsaw. 

 

Q: InWa rsaw,Poland? 

 

A: Warsaw, Poland, right. 

 

Q: In what year? 

 

A: In 1932, May 4
th
. 
 

Q: Were you an only child? 

 

A: I was not, I had a younger sister, four y
ears younger than myself.  Her name  is 
Eileen.  She lives not too far from me  here and we see each other very frequently. 
 

Q: What was your name  when you were a Polish girl in Poland? 

 

A: Frania.  Everybody called me  Frania a
nd I™m being called by my friends that 
know me  from Europe still Frania. 
 

Q: And your family na me ?  

 

A: Prawer.  That was pronounced
 Praver. Praver in Polish. 
 

Q: What kind of home  did you live in Warsaw? 

 

A: Well, our first home that I recollect, wh
ich was a very tiny apartment, on Nilefke 
(? ).  We lived over ther e for awhile until my mother gave bi rth to my sister and I 

guess the apartment became  too s ma ll and we moved to Moronovska 2 (?), and 

  
 
2
we lived ther e even while the ghetto started to be built.  The Wa ll, which 
happened to have been on the corner. 
 

Q: What kind of apartment was it? 

 

A: Very small rooms, but they were like two small bedrooms, a living room and 
anotherlittle room where my parentsworke
d.  They used to do ladies lingerie, 
like pi ecewor k.  They used to bring it hom
e every morning and work until late at 
night, and if they finished ma king the li
ngerie they would fold it up, put it in 
boxes and de liver them to a certain pl ace where I suppose they paid them rather 

well.  Because from what I can recall now
, that couldn™t ha ve been a very cheap 
apartment.  It was a brand new buildi
ng when we moved in, it was a corner 
building, we were on the fourth floor and everyone had a window, so I reme mber 

it being a lovely apar tment. 
 

Q: Was your father in business for hims el
f or was he producing for retail outlets? 
 

A: It was together with my mother.  They
 worked together in the house.  They had 
machines and I reme mbe r  them working until late hours at night.  You know 

putting out their certain quotas th
at they used to bring in. 
 

Q: So they would ma ke lingerie which woul
d then be brought to 
stores, which would 
then be sold. 
 

A: I don™t think that they brought it to the st
ores themselves, they brought it back to 
the people who gave them the pre-cut pieces
.  They just put them together, folded 
them up and put them in the boxes and de
livered them back to the places.  I 
suppose a factory or a warehouse and they, 
on the other hand, w
ould sell it to the 
stores who sold it to clients. 
 

Q: How would you describe the 
religious life of your fa mily? 
 

A: We were not religious.  I reme mber Po
lish and Yiddish being spoken in the house.  
I don™t even reme mber, too well, observing 
any of the holidays too well.  I do not 
recollect any specifi cs except for some mi nute little things, I guess it must have 

been ma ybe like Chanukah I would receive
 some  gifts and I was told it was a 
Jewish holiday, and I was told also therewas a holiday, of course now I realize it 

was Passover, where we couldn™t eat bread. 
 But, I didn™t remember it too well.  I 
reme mber eating some thing else beside brea
d.  So this is all I have a recollection 
of actual holidays. 
 

Q: Both of your parents were Jewish? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So you would describe them as secular? 

  
 
3
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Jewish but secular. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Were both of your parents born in Wa rsaw? 

 

A: No.  My father was born in Wa rsaw, my 
mother was born in Kovrin (? ), in a small 
town. 
 

Q: What were their name s, your parents™ name s? 

 

A: My mother was always called Toby.  I gue
ss in every language it™s still Toby.  My 
father was called, my mother had a name  for 
him Srulik (?), she used to call him.  
His Jewish name  was Israel.  I reme mber this mostly as Sr ulik   I reme mber my 

mother calling his name s.  That™s why this name  was more outstanding than 

whatever else other people called him.  A
nd his sisters in Israel also when they 
talked about him it™s alwa ys Srulik.  
That™s how he was known.  I guess it™s an 
abbreviation of Israel. 
 

Q: What kinds of schools did you attend in Wa rsaw? 

 

A: I did not go to any school.  I never ha
d a chance to go to school because  the war 
broke out, but my father gave me  some  education.  We  used to sit, he used to 
teach me  how to read and write and I used
 to have  to spend a certain amount of 
time everyday looking, if it was an old 
book, or if it was just a page from 
some thing, whatever was readable material 
he made sure that I know how to read 
and write. 
 
Q: InPolish?  

 

A: In Polish only.  Yes. 

 

Q: So you could read and write Poli
sh and you could understand Yiddish? 
 

A: Well, Yiddish I lear ned actually in the United Stat es. 

 

Q: You didn™t understand Yi ddish. 

 

A: I did not know a word of Yiddish un
til I came to this country and my mother 
made me lea r n Yiddish because it was th
e only wa y she could correspond with me  
here.  She did not allow me  to speak Polish in this country.  She did not know too 

well English, which I caught on within one
 year.  I spoke English when I came 
here, and for her it was more difficult and 
she used to speak Yiddish mos t  of the 

  
 
4
time to all her fr iends and I guess in no tim
e I learned the language and she would 
talk to me in Yiddish and I would answer 
back in English or half Polish until after 
awhile I learned the language well. 
 

Q: Did you know your grandparents? 

 

A: My mother™s father, he came  once, I reme mber seeing him once.  He was a tall 
ma n with a beard.  It mu st have been a 
special occasion and I 
think I wasn™t more 
ma ybe than three or four years old.  It 
must have been my mother™s sister™s 
wedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw hi m.  My grandmother died 

after she gave birth to my mother™s youngest brother, and my father™s side, I don™t 

reme mber a grandfather at all, but I do
 reme mber a grandmother, my father™s 
mother living around the corner from us when we lived on Moronovska (?).  It 

was walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed.  She lived there with my 

father™s oldest brother.  His name  wa
s Shlami k (?), and she was in the last 
bedroom and I reme mbe r  my father said
 every week we have to go and see 
grandma.  So that™s , I reme mber just 
seeing her being ill in bed.  She probably 
must have had polio, I imagine. 
 

Q: Did you have any hobbies or pe
ts when you were growing up? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: What did you want to be when you grew up? 

 

A: Alive. 
 
Q: You wanted to be alive? 

 

A: Just to be alive.  I was grateful.  Nothi
ng else and just to ma ke sure there™s always 
enough food.  Never to go hungry again. 
 

Q: Before the war was up, did you have any ---? 

 

A: I don™t remember too mu ch from before th
e war.  I was just 
a child playing. I had 
some toys.  Since one of my mother™s 
sisters had a booth in a market, I guess it 
was like a flea market at that time.  Like an indoor flea market and she had a 

booth.  She would sell toys so she used to
 bring me  certain things I would play 
with and she told me  not to break them because they would be resold tomorrow.  

Naturally I could never keep anything, but 
I played with a lot 
of things and then 
she would carefully put them back in boxes and sold them. 
 

Q: Did you have any non-Jewish
 friends before the war? 

 

A: No.  I reme mber also as I™m talking 
to you, my biggest love, I reme mber, I was 
five or ma ybe six or even younger, my fa
ther taking me  to the movies to see 

  
 
5
Shirley Temple.  I fell in love with her 
and at that time I used to go to see every 
Shirley Temple movie. 
 
Q: So you liked to see movies? 

 

A: I loved to see movies, especially with
 Shirley Temple.  They were the only 
movies I ever saw was only when Shirley 
Templ e  appeared.  Which, I guess, must 
have been once a year or  whenever 
 

Q: Werethesedubbed? 

 

A: Yes, they were dubbed. 

 

Q: Were there any other films that you liked? 

 

A: I never saw any other films.  Those were
 the only ones.  I must have seen ma ybe 
two or three Shirley Temple movies a
nd they used to sell outside, when you 

walked out of the movie  theater, they used 
to sell little ri ngs
 with her photograph 
that used sort of flash lik
e she would smile on those li
ttle pictures on the ring.  
That was my biggest treasure. 
 

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the thirties when you were growing up? 

 

A: No.  No, ,none whatsoever.  I 
didn™t know the m
eaning of it even. 
 

Q: Would you say you had a rather prot
ected or rather sheltered life? 
 

A: Yes.  Very sheltered.  I was very se
cure.  I was a very happy child and having a 
little sister, you know, ma de my life comp
lete, I guess.  Some body to play with. 
 

Q: You didn™t particularly dream of havi ng a baby brother? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Would you say your parents 
were easy going or strict? 
 

A: Very easy going. 

 

Q: If it had been possible, you wouldhave loved growing up in your house in 
War s aw?  
 

A: Yes, oh yes.  It was very comfortable. 
 I reme mbe r  my relatives living very close 
by and we used to gather rather freque n
tly.  Visit each other.
  I don™t remember 
what days or what evenings, but we were
 always not so much with friends; I don™t 
r e me mb e r  my  mo t h e r ™ s  fr i e n d s  or  my  
father™s friends, but I reme mber the 
relatives alwa ys.  Cous
ins, aunts, uncles.

Q: Do you remember any grownups talki
ng about politics during those years? 

 

A: No.  I reme mber that in 1939, they were
 talking about a war that looks like it was 
going to be a war.  I reme mber everybody 
being worried.  I reme mber the look on 
their faces, they were very worried that 
there was going to be  a war.  Then of 
course all of a sudden we were covered with bombs.  They started bombing 

War s aw. 
 

Q: So you reme mber the outbreak of the war? 

 

A: I reme mber the outbreak of the war. 
 I reme mber us running downstairs in a 
shelter in the basement of the building a
nd hiding until the sirens blew and then 
you could go upstairs again.  And this
 happened quite a few time s a day 
some ti me s.  It was very bad and we had 
very few close calls, but our building was 
never hit.  Not in 1939. 
 

Q: Do you remember the battle for Wa r saw in September 1939? 

 

A: When you say a battle --- 

 

Q: A battle, the bombardment and the siege of Warsaw? 

 

A: I reme mber the wall being built and I reme mber people being squished into 
quarters.  There were so ma ny peopl e in the 
streets at that time,
 they had to move 
from other areas to move to another area 
where we  were all like closed in.  It™s 
like if you have people scat
tered all over they took a 
certain section and they 
ma de you move there.  You had to find 
a room where to stay.  People usually 
stayed with relatives.  This did not last
 very long because the starvation came in 
very soon after the water, gas and electricit
y was shut off, food was shut off.  No 
newspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast.  I reme mber every 

morning I looked out my  window I saw dead people downstairs.  They used to 

come  around with wagons and pick them up. 
 

Q: Can we back track just a little bit. 
 Do you remember when the Germans first 
ma rched into the city of Warsaw?   When you fi rst saw Germans in the streets? 

 
A: I saw them, it seems like, after the bo
mbing.  They were like animals running on 
the motorcycles.  I would see trucks.  They
 ma de  such noises that it frightened me  
tremendously.  And everybody used to hide and run away, escape.  They would 

hit people as would drive by or run over
 people.  And I reme mber them a s  my 
instinct told me this very cruel people, 
they are.  And it™s best to hide and not 

show your face.  I understood that immediat
ely.  Even though I saw my parents 
talking quietly to each othe
r, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to 

get the next bite of food, but I saw them
 worried and I realized what it was.

Q: This was the year you were supposed to start school? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: You probably had ma de plans? 

 

A: I ma de plans.  I reme mbe r  my mother buying me  a beautiful outfit.  I think the 
sailor suit I was wearing in the pi cture.  
This mus t  have been the picture.  The 
outfit I was going to wear. 
 

Q: What school would you have gone to? 

 

A: There was a public school I would say about
 ten blocks away from us.  We used 
to walk there.  There was a park not too 
far from us.  I reme mber my father used 
to take me  for walks.  We went to th
e movies, we used to go for ice cream, go 
walking in the park and play and he 
passed by once pointing out to a building 
saying, see, some day you™ll go to this school
 right over here.  So I reme mber it 
was not far because we walked there. 
 

Q: So your father liked to take you for walks? 

 

A: Yes, my fat her would be 
the one to take me for walks 
and explain to me , and tell 
me  stories and things, sort of educating me . 
 

Q: Would you know what kind of schooling your fa ther had? 

 
A: Yes. My father finished 
Gymnasia and I reme mb er all 
the children of his fa mily, 
brothers and sisters were all educated. 
 
Q: How ma ny l a nguages could he speak? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber, but I did not understand 
certain languages that he spoke, but as 
you can see he wrote German on the photographs.  I suppose he must have known 

more than two or three languages that I 
probably did not under
stand. I only spoke 
Polish.  That was the only language I 
knew and everything else sounded like 
clatter to me. 
 

Q: Which it was.  Do you recall any othe r changes that occur after the Germans take 
over Wa rsaw?   You couldn™t go to school? 
 

A: Everything was cut off. 

 

Q: Whataboutyour 
father™s business? 
 

A: The business had ceased.  Stopped right 
away.  There was no need for it.  It 
seemed like there was no money.  There was nothing. 

  
 
8
 
Q: So what did your mother and father do during these months? 

 

A: Trying to survive.  We  were very 
busy hiding in the shelters, getting food 
together, trying to sell off things and 
to buy ma ybe flour, ma ybe an apple.  
Whatever was available.  Of course a lot 
of Poles were comi ng in to work in the 
ghetto.  There were factories, there we
re businesses and they would still be 
comi ng in.  They would smuggle in things, a lot of Jews would buy things off 

them and give away a lot of precious thi
ngs.  They would give away art, they 
would give away jewelry.  They would gi
ve away whatever was precious for the 
slightest piece of food. 
 

Q: Do you remember when th
e ghetto was first set up? 
 

A: Yes.  I lived in the building and on the 
corner  of that particul ar  building the wall 
had started, so I was watching the bricks 
going up.  Men were working over there, 
which I didn™t understand at first why th
ey™re closing off. In other words our 
building was on the inside of the ghetto wh
ich was the last  building by the wall.  I 
reme mber that and I remember the m pu
tting, the wall was so high, it seemed so 
high to me , they were putting broken gla
ss, I reme mber the smashing of bottles 
and glass putting on th
e top of the wall. 
 

Q: Do you remember how l ong it took for them to build the wall? 

 

A: It did not take long at 
all.  It seemed it grew by a foot or two or whatever. 
 
Q: Do you remember who was doing the construction work? 
 

A: I didn™t know who.  I saw me n working.  I 
don™t know if they were Poles or Jews.  
I don™t know, but I saw me n working and the Germans watching. 
 

Q: Notsoldiers? 

 

A: They were German sol diers watching, 
standing with guns and civilians were 
working, and I don™t know who they were. 
 

Q: Do you remember when this wall was built? 

 

A: The date?   I ca
nnot give you a date. 

 

Q: The time of the year? 

 

A: I guess it was all the same time, th
e very beginning, during the bombing and 
that™s when the wall started.  They must 
have decided right then and there.  The 
bombs will st op, you know, start building the wall. 
 

  
 
9
Q: So you continued to live
 in your old apartment? 
 

A: Yes, we stayed in our apartment. 

 

Q: Did anyone move into your apartme nt? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Do you remember any other changes fo
llowing the building of this wall?  For 
example, when you went out in public 
were there any changes in the way you 

went out?  
 

A: Well, you did not go out in public.  You 
were afraid to go out.  You never knew 
when the Germans woul d come  through the gate and attack and capture people.  

And a lot of people were captured.  
I reme mber seeing children dying and 

begging for food.  I also reme mber my fa
ther taking me  to a woma n who myself 

and four other little girls we used to be 
taught how to read and write.  So he used 
to take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take 

another little girl, I don™t 
know who s he was, ma ybe she was a neighbor, and take 
us to this woma n who us ed to teach us how to read and write for about, this went 

on for six months. I would say I was being ta
ught to read and write for the first six 
months ma ybe.  And even that stopped becau
se I was beaten up once in the street.  
I was wearing a little jacket and some body wa
nted my jacket so they ripped my 
jacket off and they hit me and I came ho
me  bleeding and this 
was the end of my 
education, I guess. 
 
Q: Or the beginning of a new education? 
 

 

A: Yes.  You don™t go out anymore.  Because at that time even there were hours, 
there were times you kne w when you were sa fe to go out in the street.  And she 

was only like ma ybe about a block away, 
I reme mber it was only about a five 
mi nute walk.  So that™s the reason why my 
father would take me  or pick me  up or 
I would walk back.  And that was the end of that. 
 

Q: This was insi de the ghetto after the wall had been built? 

 

A: Yes, inside the ghetto. 

 

Q: Do you know who attacked you? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber the face.  I know I 
reme mber somebody hitting me and ripping 
off my jacket and I had some thing in my
 hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or 
some thing was grabbed.  Maybe some
body who was starving, 
ma ybe he thought I 
had food.  Maybe his child was cold and he
 needed a jacket or some thing so he 
took it off me.  

  
 
10
 
Q: So he got it? 

 

A: So he got it, yes. 

 

Q: He was Jewish? 

 

A: Yes, it was in the ghetto.  You saw a 
lot of these things happening.  You were 
afraid to carry some thing.  If you had so
me thing to carry, you usually carried it 

inside your coat so nobody would detect 
it, or else you were attacked by other 
people if they suspect you have food 
on you, they™d do anything.  I guess when 
your stomach is growling and you™re
 starving you know no honor, you know no 
shame, you know nothing, you just know
 one thing, you have to eat. 
 

Q: The few times that you did go out with your
 father, for that ma tter, did you wear 
any kind of armband or star or anything? 
 

A: No.  I did not have to wear anything. 
 After that incident
 I was never allowed 
anymore to go outside anymore. 
 

Q: Do you remember whether your parents wore Jewish armba nds? 

 

A: Yes, when my father went out he put on the armband and the mi nute he entered 
the building, he would take it off.  Just
 in case some body spots him, he had to 
wear it. 
 
Q: How about your mother? 
 

A: I don™t remember my mother.  I gues
s she must have worn it also.  I don™t 
reme mber her putting it on or taking it off. 
 Maybe she did it outside when she left 
the apartment.  It was some thing you did 
not wear with pride, so like you didn™t 
want even your own children to see this
 so no questions would be asked.  But I 
saw people wearing them.  I didn™t ask b
ecause  I think I knew what the answer 
was going to be so I didn™t ask too 
many questions.  I was very silent. 
 

Q: I saw a photograph of your mother duri
ng these years.  She looked like a very 
glamorous as well as a very lovely woma n. 
 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Did she go out a lot in the ghetto? 

 

A: Well the only time it was when they closed
 the ghetto and as I said the factory 
still continued and she got a job there. A very prestigious job.  But this took a 

while until she went out on the Polish side
 and she was in contact with the other 
Poles about papers.  She got alien pape
rs that she was not Polish, she was 

  
 
11
Ukrainian.  Those were the papers 
she was given and her name  was Ana  
Gregorief (?).  I will neve r forget that
 because she spoke Russian.  She did not 
come from Warsaw so her Polish had a ve
ry bad accent.  And, therefore, to ma ke 
sure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian.  Then it™s 
OK to have an accent.  So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these 

papers and as Ana Gregorief she got the 
job in the ghetto so she could go in and 
go out and she would bring in food. 
 

Q: So she worked in the ghetto, but she was living outside of the ghetto. 

 

A: She had to go in and she had to go out.  She could go in and go out, she had a 
special passport.  The factory was like 
going around the clock.  This was not a 
nine to five job.  They were in a rush 
to ma ke these uniforms or whatever they 
were doing over there. 
 

Q: So she was ma king uniforms?  

 

A: Yes, the factory where they were ma king uniforms, ma ybe they were ma king 
other things.  She never discusse
d what they were doing there. 
 

Q: You don™t reme mber the name  of the factory? 

 

A: No, but I reme mber her once, she came  i
n, but this was a long time, much later, 
1943 already when she brought 
in a suitcase into
 the apartment and there were 
uniforms on the top and when she picked up the uniforms I reme mber seeing 

guns.  Long shotguns and boxes I guess must have been bullets.  She was bringing 
it into the ghetto from the Polish side becau
se they were talking about an uprising. 
 
Q: So your mot her smuggled guns into the ghetto? 

 

A: Yes, she smuggled in several times, and of
 course she carried 
the suitcase as if it 
weighed only twenty pounds and it coul
d have weighed over a hundred pounds.  
That™s how she got all dressed up so pe
ople would never dare, or the Germans 
never dared to question her.  She w
ould just show them the flashed Ana 
Gregorian, her name , her special pass that
 she could go in and go out and that™s 
how she got away. 
 

Q: Does the name  Tobins mean anything to you? 

 

A: I don™t remember any names. 

 

Q: I know there was a factory ma king unifo
rms it was known as the Tobins Factory. 
 

A: I never saw the factory.  The only time  
I ever saw was the time she brought the 
suitcase when she brought once.  I said what are these uniforms and she said these 

belong to the factory.  That™s
 all I reme mber her saying. 
 I don™t know if this was 

  
 
12
the factory or another factory.  I don™t 
even know where she worked.  There was 
no conversation, there was nothing wa s talked 
about so my sister and I could hear.  
My father and mother when they talked
 nobody else could hear a word they were 
saying.  She didn™t want 
us to know anything. 
 
Q: She slept though in the apartment? 

 

A: Yes.  She would go in, she would go out 
she would like to go back and forth.  She 
had the permission to go back and forth. 
 

Q: She would also bring food? 

 

A: She also brought food.  So we had food and nobody bothered her.  Because 
nobody after awhile knew who she was.  As 
people were dying out and, of course 
the crowds in the very beginning were al
l gone already and there were very few 
people now in the streets and those that su
rvived already at th
at point were hidden 
in their apartments or in baseme nts trying to scrounge food, together ma inly.  The 

ghetto was getting smaller at that poin
t, we had moved several time s already. 
 

Q: So you were forced to move out of the apartment? 

 

A: Oh, yes, we were forced out of the apar
tment and they said we have to mo ve.  My 
mother at that time  woul d say, we™re goi
ng to mo ve to a much nicer place.  She 
still tried to protect us th
at we should not know what™s 
going on.  We  were like in 
the blind in a way because she never wanted
 to reveal to us what was going on at 
that time.  But I rememb er moving and th
en again moving and then again moving.  
We were constantly on the go. 
 
Q: Were these nicer pl aces?  

 

A: No, they were not.  They were just te
mporary quarters.  We  would walk into a 
building and we would be the only ones in 
an entire building. 
 We  could take any 
apartment, so we would run to a buil
ding that was not bombe d and there were 
empty apartments.  Every floor we looked in
 all over, we looked for food.  There 
was nothing there and we 
just slept anywhere. 
 

Q: What kind of food woul
d your mother bring you? 
 

A: She would bring ma ybe a potato, she woul
d bring flour, some  kind of a vegetable, 
a lot of fruit, a piece of br ead, a pi ece 
of salami  once she brought in.  It was 
scrounged together, I guess, 
like leftovers they looked lik
e more.  It was not like 
you went to a store and you bought it.  Sh
e would ask the workers ma ybe they had 
leftovers from lunch, whatever it was, 
those were the leftovers she would buy it 
from the m. 
 

Q: Before the time  of the ghetto, were you considered a picky eater? 

  
 
13
 
A: I was a picky eater, yes 
I was a very picky eater. 
 

Q: These are not the things she 
would have ordinarily given you? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: How about your father, did 
he get any jobs during this period?   Wa s he working at 
any factories? 
 

A: No.  He was  watching my sister and 
me while my mother was the one looking 
very Polish.  Because as you can see on 
the photograph she did not resemble a 
Jew.  That™s the reason why she got away.  So she would get dressed up, she 

bought herself a coat, a hat to ma ke sure
 she looked as elegant as possible. 
Because if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away.  

Like this if you walked with your he
ad up high and very positive nobody bothered 
you.  I guess your attitude  was very important.  That™s why she survived. 
 

Q: Your father stayed home and watched the kids? 

 

A: Well, he was watching us and he also ke
pt an eye on his mother, his relatives, we 
were still in contact in
 the beginning, we™re stil
l in contact with them. 
 

Q: They also lived in the ghetto? 

 

A: In the original ghetto.  When the ghetto
 got sma ller, my grandmother must have 
died because I never heard about her again or  maybe she was shot, I don™t know, 

and neither were her uncles.  Like nobody 
had rema ined.  It was just my father, 
my mother and the two of us.  We  we re 
kept on the move.  An
d then after awhile 
we found out that one of hi
s brothers was nearby when 
my mother said would try 
to find her.  She™ll go into the building a
nd would try to find her.  We  found her, 
we found only my father™s sister-in-law, 
my aunt.  She had given birth to a baby 
at that  time .  She was ther e with an in
fant.  The infant was crying and we heard 
like an echo, the ghetto was so empt y.  
We  heard the echo and we heard German 
voices.  We  heard shotguns and we saw my
 aunt was thrown out of the window.  
She was on the sidewalk and the baby 
was ripped in half was also on the 
sidewalk. 
 

Q: So you saw your aunt? 

 

A: I did not see, my father 
saw and my mother saw.  We  
were hidden, at that time we 
were hidden in a baseme nt so I did not see anything what was going on the 

outside. 
 

Q: So your aunt was thrown out of the window? 

 

  
 
14
A: Yes.  This I reme mber my father a
nd my mother, my father crying terribly. 
 
Q: Your cousin was torn? 

 

A; Yes, torn, it wa
s a newborn infant. 
 

Q: So all you heard was the echo and the crying? 

 

A: Crying and then a silence.  And if 
some body marched blocks away you could hear 
the footsteps.  Especially German footstep
s.  You could hear German cars, trucks 
or motorcycles.  It was a dead silenc
e.  Nobody even breathed so you are not 
discovered.  At that time you 
are already hidden in ghetto and the building that we 
were there were quite a few people with
 us.  I would say about twenty people 
were together and this is when the co
nversation started with
 the uprising.  And 
then other people came and we were all lik
e together in this 
one particular area 
and they started talking.  You know, there we
re very few of us left, that some thing 
should be done and this is where my mother started bringing in the guns.  

Whatever should be done and this is when
 my mother began bringing in the guns.  
Whatever we need to do, she said, 
first we need to shoot our way out. 
 

Q: Were you afraid? 

 

A: Yes.  I was very afraid.  I didn™t know 
what the next hour wa s going to bring.  If 
we will be di scovered.  My biggest fear was if  so me one will put a gun against my 

head and shoot, because I™ve seen so ma y to
 others and it looks so terrifying, this 
was my biggest fear.  It wa
s bigger than starvation even. 
 

Q: So you saw people who were shot. 

 

A: Oh yes. I saw people shot, oh yes. 

 

Q: Peopleyouknew? 

 

A: People I knew?   Even if people I knew
 I probably would not have recognized 
them.  People looked very different during the war.  They became  extremely 

skinny, they ages, they were very ragged l
ooking, very dirty.  There was no water.  
If there would be no rain, we would never have nothing to drink.  So even if 

some body was shot, I did not know who they were.  I didn™t know anybody. I 

didn™t recognize anyone.  I just sa
w their brains being shot out. 
 

Q: Right on the street? 

 

A: On the street.  Running.  If you we
re running they would grab some body a nd 
shoot them right in the head.  If it was 
a child, or a woman, it made no difference, 

and leave them.  And then 
there would be some body to come with a little wagon 
picking up bodies.  The bodies piling up and taking them some place. 

  
 
15
 
Q: How long did this go on? 

 

A: This went on until the plans were made for the Jewish uprising. Which was, I 
would say, 1943.  Since 1939.  At that poi
nt when my mother knew there was 
going to be an uprising, she ma de arrangeme
nts for my sister and myself t o be 
taken out of the ghetto and taken by the 
Poles, one fa mily was called Doblinkov 
(? ) and whom I was held in their home .  I was taken out, smuggled out of there. 
 

Q: Byyourmother? 

 

A: No, not by my mother, the Poles with a 
truckload of me rchandise went out and we 
were hidden on the truck and then we were
 supposed to be dropped off at a certain 
point, we jumped off the truck and they 
were waiting for us.  Two people were 
waiting for us, one took my sister, one t
ook me .  I didn™t know the whereabouts of 
my sister and this was the last  time I sa
w my parents.  And we stayed with the 
Doblinkov (?) family which was about, quite 
a ride with the trolley.  At that time , 
on the Polish side, the trolleys were goi
ng.  So we were changing trolleys and 
going like to the outskir
ts of Wa rsaw and I saw a very 
little, pr ivat e little cottage, 
a little house.  This is where I was brought in by this ma n.  He  had a daughter 

about a year or two older than myself 
and a son about a year or two younger than 
me .  And he  introduced me  to the fa mily 
that I am going to live with them and I 
and their mo ther™s sister™s daughter who died
 so they are to take care of me and I 
come from a nother town.  I don™t rememb
er.  Lodz or Krakow, or whatever.  
They picked a city and said this is wher
e I come from and this is going to be my 
name  and this is where I™m going to stay.  My name  was Yasha. 
 

Q: Yasha? 

 

A: Yes, I became  Yasha Doblinkov.  And they said this is where I am to stay and this 
is going to be my fa mily.  And I had to adju
st to that instantly.  The first thing, I 
was very happy, they gave me  food.  They
 gave me , I re me mber, a giant bowl of 
potatoes, ma shed potatoes and I think I fi
nished it.  It was I think ma ybe five 
pounds and I finished it all.  And they 
gave me  a glass of milk, which is 
some thing I had not seen in years, sin
ce before the war.  That was good.  So I 
think they got through to 
me  through my stomac h. 
 

Q: You had never seen these people? 

 

A: I have never seen them, I have never known them. 

 

Q: Would you say you were quite skinny when you arrived there? 

 

A: Yes.  I was very skinny and she said to me , I a m going to fatten you up.  Don™t 
worry you™re going to look very nice. 
 

  
 
16
Q: Did she say anything else to you? 
 

A: Yes.  Of course when the uprising starte
d, which did not last ve
ry long.  After that 
all of ghetto was burning.  It was afla
me.  One giant flame and she took me 
outdoors and she said to me , you know, this 
is where you come from and this is 

where your parents are.  And I reme mb
er rema rking the sky was so red, like 
blood, it looked like and it was towards ev
ening.  And she said to me , you will 
never see your parents again.  They perished
 in the fire.  So you are going to stay 

with us.  I am going to take you to church.  You™re going to go through a 

Communion.  You™ll become  a Christian and 
you™ll become  part of my fa mily and 
we will treat you equally with my children.  
I started to cry.  I wanted to see my 
mommy and I wanted to see my daddy and 
I didn™t want to live with them.  I 
didn™t want  to go to a church.  But she 
said, if you are not going to obey we will 
have to take you back where you came from. 
So I just closed my mouth.  I shut up 
and I didn™t say another word.  I just 
did whatever they told me  to do. 
 

Q: And you ate the food? 

 

A: And I ate the food, yes, and they gave
 me a little bed in th
e corner to sleep. 
 

Q: Is this around the time  you started to wear the cross? 

 

A: They put a cross on me , yes.  They put
 the cross on me  a very short time  after 
that.  They said to me  you are going to c
hurch so you must wear a cross and I did 

not take that cross off until si x months after the war.  This was I felt like my, in a 

way I wasn™t hungry anymore since I wore th
e cross.  So I felt that this maybe 
protected me from starvation.  And they 
said if you wear th
e cross you will never 
be hungry and you will always have a roof 
over your head and we are going to be 
your fa mily because you have nobody else 
 

Q: How long did you live with them?  

 

A: Oh, for a fe w months, I would say, quite 
a few months.  At that point already, I 
realizedthat my mother and my father ar
e gone.  I didn™t realize, of course, that 
my father was captured.  Right during 
the uprising he was captured taking 
_____________,  my mo ther, of course, head out
.  She was still in the ghetto for 
quite some time and the way she got out is
 a whole story by itself.  It was very 
mi raculous.  At that time she did not 
look so elegant, she did not look so 
glamorous as she did just a couple of 
months before that.  She was hungry, she 
was tired, she lost a husband in that tim
e and she changed tremendously and the 
few people that did survive were in the se
wers for quite some  time and then when 
they got on the other si de, that™s the 
reason why it took such a time, until she 
finally one evening just knocked on the door and came to the Doblinkov family 

and when I saw her, to me it was lik
e a new world had opened up.  I never 
believed I™d ever see her again. 
 

  
 
17
Q: You never believed the Doblinkov™s _______. 
 

A: They were going to be my parents, I had to
 mentally adjust myself that this is it.  I 
am most probably stay with 
them.  I never thought that
 my mother was going to 
ma rch in through the door. 
 

Q: Shedid? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you recognize her? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  Imme diately I ran to her arms
 and I wouldn™t let go
.  I held onto her 
dress.  She took me  by the hand, she took a few things and said that some  of the 

people gave them some t hing when we walk
ed out.  We  had a car waiting outside.  

I don™t know if it was some  kind of taxi, 
or somebody doing my mother a favor or 
whatever.  Whoever it was, I don™t know. 
 All I know I was so happy looking and 
staring at my mother™s face, I coul dn™t 
believe that she was there and then we 
drove for about fifteen mi nutes to anothe
r building where I had to sit in the car 
and she brought my sister down all wr a
pped up in a blanket and it seemed like 
they were starving my sister because sh
e looked terrible.  She was all swollen 
with no clothes on, frozen and it was very 
cold and my mother wrapped her up in 
the blanket and came running down angrily what they had done to her child in 

those few months only. 
 

Q: So you had not seen your sister since March of ™43? 
 
A: I saw her only one time  when that family has written a letter to the Doblinkov 
fa mily that they have the other sister a
nd they probably want to know, ma ybe they 
can get rid of her and send her to me .  So
 there wa s an address and I said to my 
_____,  I used to call her my aunt, I said
 to my Aunt Doblinkov, I said can I 
please see my sister?   I had five mi nute
s.  So, I reme mber going on a trolley and 
her daughter went with me  and we went 
upstairs and I only had five mi nutes and I 
reme mber my sister laying over there in
 bed and Mrs. Doblinkov gave a piece of 
salami  and a piece of bread to give it to my sister.  So when I came in I gave this 

to her and she was very cold and the 
woma n was  standing there and watching.  I 
gave her the food and she hid it under th
e blanket and I stood there helpless not 
knowing what to do.  I saw that she wa
s dying, that she was starving and there 
was nothing I could do about it.  And th
e woma n said, OK., your time is up you 
got to leave.  I said I just 
want to sit with my sister a 
little more.  No, she said, you 
have to go.  Lady, I said, I want to be w
ith her.  She said no, leave and I had to 
leave.  I left her the food and when 
I came back to Mrs. Doblinkov she asked 
about my sister.  I said she is ver
y, very hungry.  I™ve known children that look 
like her they usually die right
 after that.  She said ther
e™s nothing I can do about it, 
I cannot help her. 
 

  
 
18
Q: So your mot her snatched her? 
 

A: Snatched her out in the nick of time, 
and she was dying.  As a ma tter of fac t , she 
did not grow for five years, not one inc
h, after that incident.  After those few 
months of the starvation I guess this is 
what happens to children.  The lack of 
everything.  My mother was very frightened
 that she™ll be a mi dget, she was so 
tiny.  Not until we came  to the United States she started growing. 
 

Q: Where did your mother take you? 

 

SIDE 2. 
 

A: A very nice apartment. 

 

Q: In Warsaw?  

 

A: In Wa rsaw on the Dobra Street, which wa
s right across from the Vislag (?) River. 

 

Q: This was outside of the __________. 

 

A: As Poles, yes.  We  lived as Poles.
  We all had our papers.  I had my ______. 

 

Q: My mother found an apartment on the D
obra Street, this is where we lived and 
she got a job.  She was working in a fact
ory again.  I guess run by the Germans ,  
so she had enough mone y to pay for the re
nt and it was also food was scarce in 
Poland, but you were not starving and we ca me
 t o ourselves after awhile.  In the 
meanti me  my mother did a lot of heroic 
things while she worked in the factories 
and ma nufa c tured the uniforms, she  decide
d to custom make some uniforms for  
some  big generals, big ﬁmachers,ﬂ they called them in Jewish.  And they sent her 

to several different concentration camps.  She wound up going. 
 

Q: Not as a prisoner? 

 

A: Not as a prisoner, but asking them what 
sizes they are, what kind of uniforms they 
want.  So s he could make them up custom made for the upper echelon type of 

generals.  This was one time when she saw my father very briefly, from a  

distance. 
 

Q: She saw your father? 

 

A: She saw my  father from a distance, and she whispered to him, of course nobody 
could see, you got a chance, you can put
 on one of those uniforms and you can 
escape.  He says I cannot run even, how can I escape?   You go, save yourself and 

save the children, forget about me .  And th
is was the last she saw him.  But there 
was another ma n that did run away with he
r.  Went along with her on the truck. 
This is the man that has written a book 
and he has written about this whole 

  
 
19
episode in the book.  His name  is Cheslov (?).  I don™t know if this ma n is alive or 
not, and I have the book that he has writte
n.  There is a whol
e chapter about my  

mother.  And after she took him out sh
e brought him on Dobra Street.  She 
brought him into the apartment and we held him there for awhile.  Then the 

following week, she went to another camp 
and she brought in two sisters she took 

out, two women that she said she needed th
em as assist ants.  They let them out, 
she brought them and she brought them to 
the apartment also.  And one night the 
Germans were knocking at the door.  The 
two sisters were caught and they were  
taken out.  This ma n went out the window and he was not captured. 
 

Q: The man tha t  she smuggled from the camp?  

 

A: Yes, he was not captured.  And they 
left  with the two sisters, they left . 
 

Q: They didn™t punish your mother for this? 

 

A: No. They, I don™t reme mber what was the st
ory, she just must ha
ve told them that 
ma ybe they knocked on the door and she let them
 in.  They just came  in, they just 
walked in, or some thing, some  kind of an excus e .  She ma de believe she doesn™t 

know them.  It™s not like this
 was an old friendship or 
some thing.  That she did it 
intentionally.  Seems like these two women ju
st walked in and they asked to sleep 
over ma ybe, or they asked for so
me thing, so they let us alone. 
 

Q: Do you know when your mother saw your father for the last time? 

 

A: The last time I would say a year before
 the war ended, ma ybe less.  Maybe it was 
less than when the war ended.  She said he looked terrible. 
 

Q: You had been living in the Po
lish part of Wa rsaw for a year? 
 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: Which camp was this? 

 

A: My father?  In Miedni ewice. 

 

Q: Would you know which other camps  your mo
ther visited as a custom seamstress? 
 

A: I don™t know.  I know she went to seve
ral camps.  She never discussed anything 
with me  or my sister.  She never told us  very much.  She would say I have to go 

away and I™ll be back in a few days.  Th
at™s all we knew.  We  never questioned 
her.  She would say you are not to leave the house and you are not to leave the 

apartment.  Keep it locked at all times, and that ™s how it was. 
 

Q: Nobody was there to take care of you? 

 

  
 
20
A: No, no.  We  were there ourselves. 
 

Q: Did she tell you that
 she saw your father? 
 

A: She told us that a long time  a fterwards. 

 

Q: Until that time you did not know? 

 

A: No.  We knew, I sensed that some th
ing was wrong when she came back.  She did 
not sleep, she talked to herself, sh
e was shouting, she was crying and I knew 
some thing was wrong, but she didn™t want to
 tell us what it was.  It was onl y 
years after when she told us.  I saw hi
m from a distance, I would have never 
recognized him in a million 
years if he stood a foot 
in front of me, but he 
recognized me .  So he called out my  name  and I saw him.  
 

Q: So he recognized her first? 

 

A: He recognized my mother 
first.  She did not know 
where the voice was comi ng 
from.  She would not have known it was him.
  All she told him 
I can save you.  If 
I™ll throw you the uniform, put it on and wa
lk out, ma rch out like a German.  And 
he was like behind a fence and she was on this
 side of the fence.  There were a lot 
of fences.  There were me n standing th
ere with those striped uniforms and she 
tried to save him, which I think would 
have been hopeless anyway, so he was 
afraid that he™s goi
ng to jeopardize her life, so he sa
ys no, no.  He did not want to 
go.  In a way she could not forgive hers
elf seeing him and yet maybe she could 
have helped him as a Ukrainian but he 
didn™t want to jeopardize her life.  He 
didn™t want to go. 
 

Q: Was he a slave laborer? 

 

Q: I don™t know he was just standing therewith other me n.  She doesn™t know, he  
must have been working, they must have 
been feeding him a little bit, because he 
survived.  He did survive sometime there.
  I would say ma ybe like seven or eight 
months later when she saw him.  This  wa
s the last person on ea
rth she expected to 
see.  She knew that he was taken to th
is concentration camp.  This she knew. 
Because she realized that this particular
 truck they captured people, that™s where 
they were going. 
 

Q: So she knows when he was ta
ken away during the uprising? 
 

A: Yes.  It was just th
e beginning of the uprising. 
 

Q: The very beginning? 

 

A: The very beginning of the uprising. 

 

  
 
21
Q: Did you ever find out later what your
 mother was doing during the uprising? 
 
A: What she did during the uprising?   I 
guess she was fighting like the handful of 
people that were there.  They were figh
ting until there were very few people left. 
She said it was a glorious fight.  It was gl
orious.  So they gave her a reason to live 
again.  There was a thread of hope , of 
course. They knew they cannot do very 
much but just to gi ve the Germans someth
ing back.  A little revenge for all the 
aches and pains they caused everybody. 
 

Q: Did she ever describe how she got out
?  how this Ukrainian factory woma n who 
became a Jewish fighter how then she survived and got out of the ghetto and then 

found you? 
 

A: Oh, this was through the sewers, this took time , this took time, until she finally 
got out of there.  Th
ey could not escape, th
ey put the gas in the sewers, they ma de  
sure that nobody can escape, there were dogs all over.  They had to be at a hideout 

for quite some  time until they could get out fr om wherever they were hiding until 

it became clearer that she could get out of
 there.  But this took awhile, because 
they were on the lookout.  They knew that whoever survived 
this uprising would 
want to escape because there was nothing el
se left there.  It was a handful of 
heroic people and they™re not ready to 
give up.  So even the sewers you couldn™t 
go, it was all gas there. They would have
 gotten poisoned.  So they had to wait 
probably until it was o.k.to find a way to leave. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther survive and escape 
by herself or was she with others? 

 
A: No, I think they could not go in gro
ups.  Everybody went their own way, because 
in a group it is more dangerous.  Singular
ly it always easier to escape when a 
single person runs.  I don™t know, maybe 
they started as a group and they wound 
up individually, I don™t
 know.  She never talked about th
at particular incident.  It 
was a very painful incident in her life.  
Very painful. And eve n though she used to 
talk about a lot of things, 
she used to remi nd us when we were in the small ghetto, 
at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sis t er and I 
were gone and my father was gone.  It seems like the Germa ns came, they were 

comi ng and they said we™re going to put
 the building on fi re whoever™s ther e 

doesn™t run away or doesn™t give themselv
es up they™re going to get burned alive. 

So I don™t know how it happened, how my 
si ster and I somehow or other my 
father, where was my fa ther, I™m trying to 
think, he was also gone in the morning. 
He did not go to work, but my mother we
nt to work and he went some place and 
my sister and I were left 
alone.  And when the Ge rman
s came, we looked at each 
other, what are we going to do, we  got 
to run away some place.  So, we went  
downstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall 

there to go to the next building and th
e next building, so we escaped through a 
few other buildings.  They were also
 empty, so we didn™t know what had 
happened to the building we were originall
y.  I don™t know if they put it on fire or  

they didn™t put it.  But the two of us
 crawled through and we wound up another 

  
 
22
building and the first thing we started 
doing is running from apartment to 
apartment which was all abandoned and th
ere wa s no food nowhere.  We turned 
quietly every drawer and every closet,we looked all over and then we hear 
Germans marching downstairs and they™r
e entering the building and here™s my 
sister and I alone in this apartment and it™s all empty.  I remember I took her and I 

put her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet.  I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet 

and I put a blanket on top of her and I cl
osed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest 
that stood like on a corner, it was some kind 
of corner chest.  I squished in the 
back of that chest and covered myself also
 with a blanket so if they even look in 
they™ll think there are rags there.  A
nd I took a blanket and covered my self and 
the two of us stayed there.  We  hea r d 
the German footsteps and we heard them 
getting closer and closer and then they 
kicked open the door and they ma rched in 
this apartment.  They must have been
 looking for Jews from apa r tment to 
apartment.  This was their preoccupati
on and that™s how I 
know this, and they 
walked in and they machine gunned with 
the ma chine guns.  They were shooting 
in every apartment.  All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting.  I 

guess in a way they were afraid also 
maybe somebody was  going to attack them 
or something.  So they would come in 
with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I  

heard them talking loud and clear I didn™
t understand what they were saying. 
Then I heard them walk out.  And when 
they walked out and they left the door, 
my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister™s name , are you alive?  She says Yes, 

are you alive?   I said yes.  So we gottogether again, she came out of the cabinet  

and we decided we™re going to hide in 
the attic.  From now on it was no good in 
the apartment because they are shooting a
nd they ma y shoot us
.  So we™ll go in 
the attic.  We go all the way up in the attic and there™ s a lot of furniture and we 

hear voices.  So we realize, because 
we were very quiet, we knew there were 
people hidden in the attic.  We starte
d moving the furniture away and the people 
outside didn™t know what™s  going on.  And 
I s a id, we were yelling in Polish, let 
us in, let us in, we got to hide with you. 
 So my s i ster said, well, I™m going to cry 

so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I™m going to tell them tha t  

you™re hi ding there, so let us in there.  We came  in over there, we sat with them, 

they had water, so we drank a little water with them. 
 

Q: Did you know who these people were? 

 

A: I had no idea.  We  just walked in.  There 
were about three or f
our people there.  It 
looked like older people, maybe at that time,
 ma ybe they were in their 40™s, 50™s, 
60™s.  I don™t know I couldn™t even judge the 
age.  We  stayed w
ith them for a few 
days and then we left them, and we we
re going from building to building, we got 

to find our parents, where are our parents,
 we had no idea.  And from one of the 
buildings we saw there were schlep carts
 and we saw people gathering and the  
two of us would look out the window, 
you know hidden behind the curtain, to 
make sure we don™t see our mother or our 
father.  I didn™t know what to look for. 
I didn™t see them.  So, I said, you see 
they did not get caught, they didn™t get 
caught they must be someplace.  Don™
t you think my mother came around.  She 

  
 
23
walked also fr om building to building yelling quietly, Frania, Chaja, just  like an 
echo from the distance it sounded like. So she found us. 
 

Q: She found you? 

 

A: And my father must have gone to work 
also that day. My mother went to work, 
my father went also to do some thing.  Maybe to look for food. 
 

Q: So your father worked some times? 

 

A: Like some time s, depending.  They were
 always very busy, they were always 
doing some thing. 
 

Q: What would your father do 
whenever he found some  work? 
 

A: I guess whatever labor they gave you.  They didn™t ask you what your talents 
were.  They needed some body.  I guess 
like today, you know, pe
ople want a job, 
whatever they™ll tell them to do they™ll do, so th
ere was no question of asking 
what your talents are or what 
you specialize, I™ll do anything. 
 

Q: This episode that you just described, th
is flashback, this wa s before the ghetto 
uprising, long before? 
 

A: Oh, yes.  Not long before.  This was in a small ghetto.  This was when we had an 
apartment ________, when we were staying there for awhile. 
 
Q: This wasn™t the Morenovska (? ) 
 

A: No, the Morenovska, we were gone already. 
 This was like the third or the fourth 
apartment already, that we were on the 
go.  So we were like constantly like 
gypsies on the go running.  The mi nute we were afraid ma ybe they heard 

footsteps, we  would leave the building alr
eady.  We were afraid to st ay in the 
same  place three or four nights that™s it and you ha d to be on the move. 
 

Q: And that™s the way it was until 
they took you to the Doblenkov house? 
 

A: Yes.  This was up until, I would say, th
e last  few weeks be fo
re we went to the 
Doblenkov™s.  Then we were like more settl
ed with other people.  All of a sudden 
I saw a lot of other people.  I don™t reme mber their faces, but I reme mb er there 

were quite a few people there and they we
re talking constantly and ma king plans 
and they would tell us, there were a few 
children, go sit on the side, go away, not  
to bother anybody, and they we
re ma king their plans.  
So we were there for a 
while.  Once they ma de  up, I guess, a date when they™re going to start this.  This 

is when my  mother ma de up her mind to 
get me and my sister, to get us on the  
Polish side so we™re 
not going to get caught. 
 

  
 
24
Q: Now, back to Warsaw after the upr
ising, when you were 
living in 
the ----- 
 
A: On Dobra Street? 

 

Q: Yes.  We re you living in Wa rsaw 
when the Polish uprising occurred? 
 

A: Yes.  It did not take very long, I heard 
shooting in the streets and my mot her came  
running in like she was being chased 
for G-d knows how ma ny blocks or miles 
and when she came in she says would you believe that the Russians were 

supposed to come and they™re not comi ng, 
they™re on the other side, on the Prague 
side, and they™re not crossing 
the river and they told the Poles to st art.  This was 
the first time she talked to me, and she says and the Poles are starting an uprising 

now.  So we ™re going to get caught no
w in the mi ddle of their uprising. 
 

Q: How long had you been ther
e when the uprising begins? 
 

A: Immediately.  We had to leave ri
ght away.  They made announcements. 
Everybody to leave the buildings.  Everybody 
to go.  They™re going to shoot every 
Pole that™s going to stay here 
and help the Russians to cross. 
 

Q: So how long had it been since you left 
the Doblenkov™s and then lived in Warsaw 
before the uprising? 
 

A: On the Dobro Street?   A few months. 

 

Q; Just a few months? 
 
A: Just ac few months, yes.  Then we ha
d the uprising again and we were on the go 
again.  And I reme mber my mother burying 
a suitcase.  She sa
ys one thing I don™t 
want to carry with me  is luggage.  Le t™s 
bury it in the baseme nt, we™ll come  ba c k  
if we ever survive the war we™re going to
 take out my little treasures, pictur es, 
letters, addresses of relatives in Israel , relatives in the United States. 
 

Q: She was not involved in 
this particular uprising? 

 

A: No, no.  She couldn™t care less about it. 
 It was a nuisance.  It was a tremendous  
nuisance.  They started burning build
ings and chasing the Poles and running 
through the streets and the bu
ildings were all burning an
d they were chasing. 
Also I reme mber running for about twenty
 blocks and the la
st few blocks the 
buildings were ablaze 
and we couldn™t crossing. 
 We  couldn™t go through 
anymore.  There was a church and they 
ma de us all, quite a fe w hundred, pushed 
into this chur ch. 
 

Q: The Germans pushed? 

 

A: Yes, all the Poles pushed into this
 church.  My mother ma de sure ---- 

  
 
25
 
Q: And you we re still passing as a Pole? 

 

A: Oh yes.  We  had Polish papers and n
obody knew otherwise.  We were right at the 
door.  At the door or there was a window, 
some  kind of exit even if we were  
locked in we would be able to get out, 
because my mother said I have a feeling 
they™re going to do something to us.  Th
ey™re going to, she 
thought they™re going 
to put the poison gas and they™re going to poison everybody there.  We didn™t 

know they were going to put it on fire.  
So we just broke through the glass and 
people started panicking.  They were breakin
g all the like st ained glass, whatever 
there was there.  People started clim
bing from the windows and running and 
jumping into the fl ames and we ran.  At that point we ran with the fi re on both 

sides.  My mother grabbed me  and my 
sister.  I don™t remember how far, I was 
like in a daze, we just ran until fi nally it was a cl earance and all the people that  

came out into a clearance, the Germans we
re there and there was a train and we 
all were pointed to get on 
the train and my mot her saw a train and she was like 
petrified.  She says oh, my G-d, we™re 
going to a concentration camp.  She  
already knew at that  point that al l trains
 were going only in 
one direction.  But it 
did not go to a concentration camp, it went
 to another camp, some kind of camp, a  
detention camp where as Poles we were he
ld over ther e, but ther e were  not like 
guards, they gave us to eat, 
they gave us cots to sleep
 on and we had like a army  
blanket even to cover ourselves and I reme mber  that my mother said, this is no 

good, I don™t like this business 
here, you know, with the Poles they™re going to do 
something with them also.  It™s mostly
 wome n and children here.  The me n, the y  
were shooting them like dogs.  And we escap
ed.  We were not there very long, we 
escaped. 
 

Q: Do you know the name  of this camp? 

 

A: No.  I have no idea. 

 

Q: So where did you go? 

 

A: We started running.  Most of the time 
we were hiding out during the day and we 
were on foot at night.  And we went th
rough towns and villages 
all on foot and we 
stopped at different, and I re
me mber  my mother saying, if
 we™re going to walk in 
this direction anothe
r twenty kilome ters there™s a 
small town I know some people 
there.  We™ll go there and when we made
 it over there, we stayed with them, I 

think for about two nights, and we heard th
e Germans outside so we ran out to the 
back, the three of us es caped.  And we were on the run continuously on the run 

until I don™t know for how long on foot until
 we came to this primitive little 
village where only farms, lik
e small little straw roof t
ype of little huts.  People 
lived like that and we were all very ra
gged, and my mother ma rched into these 
houses, claimi ng some  kind of accident, 
something happened and we  needed 
refuge for just a few days.  And when th
ey asked us where we come  fr om.  We  
said we come from Wa rs aw.  She said, oh, she heard about Warsaw, can you tell 

  
 
26
us stories about it.  She says if you let 
me  sleep here, I™ll tell you all the stories 
you want to know.  They heard about wa
gons going on electric.  This was all 
primitive, and when I think back, my  G-d like a fe w hundred years behi nd times.  
 
Q: Thesewerepeasants? 

 

A: Real peasants.  Good natured, nice people, 
that were afraid of 
their own shadows. 
They knew there was a war, because the Germans came and took away most of 

their cattle, and took away whatever they 
had.  They were constantly comi ng and 
took away their wheat and their co
rn, whatever they were growing. 
 

Q: Do you remember the time  of the y
ear that you were with these people? 
 

A: We were there in the wi nter .  We we
re there until the Russians came into this 
village.  That™s how long we were there. 
 

Q: Do you remember the day the Russians came to the village? 

 

A: No, I don™t.  I reme mb er
 the day they ma rched in I don™t reme mber the date, 
because I think we were 
all in a state of shock. 
 

Q: Was it the mi ddle of winter though?  

 

A: I reme mber it being cold.  I don™t know
 if it was the beginning, the end or the 
mi ddle of winter, but I reme mber it being 
very cold.  When the Russians came  in 
my mother started talking Russian to them.  She could not get over that  they came  
in, and the first question she had for them, did you hear of a Bernard Friedman, 
my brother is in Russia, ma ybe he is in
 the army?  Well afte
r awhile we found a  
Jewish Russian soldier who was a Jew.  He
 was very nice.  As the Russians came 
in and the war is over, and they said they are chasing the Germans are just in front 

of the m and they were passing with tanks which were so loud and we pa cked up 

our few little belongings and they did not
 mi nd taking us, jumping in the truck 
and taking us along, a part of a truck and part
 we sat on a tank.  Just to get out of 
this village, and we wanted to go to a
ny town and as we wer e  going through on 
these ve hicles we saw the Germans hanging 
from trees.  Which was some  sight to 
see. 
 

Q: How were they hanging? 

 

A: They were hanging some  by the legs, some  by the neck, some  by the hands. 
Some  by one foot.  They just hung them live.
  They were hanging live there.  As 
they turned around, they were practice shooting with them
.  They took guns, they 
were shooting at them and they were 
jumping on their ropes, and they were 

yelling in Russian, this is for my mo ther a
nd this is for my fa th
er, what you did to 
my country to my Mother Russia.  Fo
r the millions you™ve killed.  You know. 
And this is what they we
re yelling at.  Even I 
understood the few words in 

  
 
27
Russian.  I didn™t know Russian, but I unde
rstood those few words, it was very 
similar to Polish. 
 

Q: What was your reaction to this scene? 

 

A: I was glad.  I was very glad.  I hated th
e Germans so much with such passion that 
I think if they cut them alive, it would not
 have bothered me .   On the contrary, I 
think I would have found some  kind of satisfaction. 
 

Q: How about your mother, how was she? 

 

A: My mother went into a shock.  She actually went into a shock because after a 
short while after she got very
 sick.  And they told her 
that she was in a shock.  I 
don™t think it was a stroke, it was some  ki
nd of a shock she went into.  When we  
came into one of the cities, we passed 
by a city, I don™t even know what big city 
we passed by, she went to a hospital.  I was there sitting and they told her they 

have to treat her for a few days.  And 
I didn™t know what was wrong with her. 
But I reme mber my sister  and I si tting and waiting for her to get well, because we 

couldn™t go anyplace without her.  This
 was it, you know.  Sh
e got well after a 
few days and I reme mb er she became  very calm.  She was not as wild as she was 

during the war.  She would do crazy thi
ngs.  She would jump, and run, and lift 
and pick.  But here after she got sick, we
 were released, I guess from the German 

agony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come .  Every day was a  

year, you™re talking about 
five long mi serable years, mi serable years.  
 

Q: The period you were on the run, fr
om whe n you escaped from t he Polish 
detention camp until the time the Russians caught you. 
 

A: That took also quite a few months. 

 

Q: When you fi rst escaped, what time of
 the year was it?   Wa s it summer? 

 

A: It was warm.  I know it was warm because
 from the fire it was hot, or something, 
or the people in trains.  But I was warm. 
 

Q: How did you ma nage to survive the ch
ange in seasons?  You probably were 
dressed lightly in the summer and then months later it was winter? 
 

A: We were shivering.  If we could steal 
some thing to wear or if we saw a body we 
would rip off some thing to
 wear.  I wore ma ybe a hundred different kinds of 
shoes.  Wha t ever I could find, I had no shoe
s at all.  Most of the time my mother 
wanted me to be very quiet when I walked so she made me walk without shoes. 

And I shouldn™t knock.  But we used to 
always find some thing on ways.  We  
found rags.  Once we passed a sma ll river,
 so my mother washed my face, she 
said my G- d, I forgot what you looked 
like.  I was black from mud, from 
crawling, from hiding, 

  
 
28
 
Q: You were still at Doblinkov until th
e Russians came?   Were you still called 
Doblinkov? 
 

A: No.  Once my mother took me  out from the Doblinkov family.  I was not a 
Doblinkov anymore.  I had those papers like this.  The only thing was she claimed 

that she adopted a daughter, I was a rela
tive™s daughter and she adopted me .  So 
that™s the reason why she and 
I had two different name s. 
 

Q: So officially you were still Doblinkov. 
 And this went on until the Russians came  
in. 
 

A: No, once in the primitive village, we di
dn™t need any papers or  anythi ng.  Nobody 
questioned us, nobody knew from anything an
ymore.  It was like I said, they 
didn™t even know anything exists.  You 
know, fr om a clock, they knew nothing. 
 

Q: Did they know Jews? 

 

A: They heard about people that were Jews
 and they heard, they™re supposed to look 
out for them because they are very cruel and very mean and you can usua lly tell 

just by looking at them.  That was a pr
opaganda, of course.  Oh, if you s ee a Jew 
you™ll know right away, he™ll l
ook subhuma n, first of all. 
 

Q: Are they worse than Nazis, these Jews  supposedly? 

 

A: Not in that way, no.  They were just vi
cious and they were ugl
y and they tried to 
steal from you whatever you had.  They 
tried to connive you whatever you had. 
 

Q: More than the Germans did?  

 

A: Yes.  It shows you this was in the school
s. The children were taught like that.  The 
children were taught, the Polish children we
re taught, they would ma ke a  picture 
of this, I don™t know, a witch I guess they would pick, and they would say this is 

what a Jew looks like.  And it is the biggest
 honor to find one,and if you want to 
kill them yourself, it™s o.k., and if you want to give him to us, we™ll kill hi m.  
 

Q: But they wouldn™t know one even if
 they were under their own roof? 
 

A: No.  They never saw one.  They only know from what they heard.  Don™t forget, 
the war was on for quite a few years alrea
dy at that point and they knew nothing 
of what was going on in th
e outside their village. 
 

Q: So they had three of th
em right in th
eir own house? 
 

  
 
29
A: And they thought that we  were very fa
ncy people from Warsaw after we washed 
up.  They realized that they
 called my mother.  In Po
lish there™s an expression, 
ﬁPania (?) Intelligenciaﬂ that mean
s you are a lady pf intelligence. 
 
Q: Of  intellect . 

 

A: Of intellect and, therefore, if we ha
ve any questions they would ask her when 
Christma s come s out, when the holidays. 
 Of course, they have no calendar, no 
clock, nothing, no radio.  Didn™t know 
anything.  If I thought ________, and they 
gave us this tiny lit
tle room that was supposed to ha
ve been an attached bathroom 

originally, just some boards
.  This is where we slept.  So they knew nothing about 

Jews if they hit them over the head, probably.  Luckily, they were very nice to us, 

They gave us food, we ate with them and 
my mo ther helped them with the farm, 
with the work and I did some work.  I would s weep and clean and grow things. 

Whatever she told me  to do, we would do it. 
 

Q: When did you become  Frania Prawer again? 

 

A: Again? 

 

Q: I mean openly. 

 

Q: Openly?   In Ger many.  Because after th
e war, after we left Wa rsaw and we saw 
we had nothing there, we registered. 
 

Q: You returned to Warsaw eventually? 
 
A: Right after the war we returned to Warsaw, my mother wanted to get that  
briefcase. 
 

Q: And what did she find? 

 

A: Nothing.  Rubbles.  All rubbles you c
ouldn™t even tell if a building was once 
standing.  It was all burned 
down and we went to Berlin. 
 We stayed in Berlin for 
about six months and we were
 in Berlin we tried to 
get to the Amer ican side 
because we were told it was best from
 the Russian side with the Russians, 
eventually, like with cars, trucks, trai ns until we got fr om Poland to Berlin we did 

a lot of traveling.  So 
we wound up on the Russian side
 of Berlin and then we  
escaped to the French side and then fina
lly got to the American si de.  Once we 
were on the American side, we re-registe
red and we found a lot of other Jews 

there and they told us that there are 
some  ca mps in Germa ny, they™re called DP 
camps where all the Jews after the war s
hould gather, and from there we will see  
what to do further, where to go further.
  So this is where we wound up from 
Berlin we went to Eschfe gan (? ), Germ
any, a DP camp where we lived for almost 
four years. 
 

  
 
30
Q: From when to when were you in this camp?  
 

A: In that  camp  we got there in the beginni
ng of ™46, I would say, until ™49, when we  
came to the United States. 
 

Q: So you came to the U.S.in ™49, the three of you? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And lived happily ever after. 

 

A: Well,muchhappier 
than during the war. 
 

Q: And your sister finally grew up? 

 

A: Yes, she did grow up.  My mother took 
her to several doctors.  She used to get 
some  vita mi ns and very special things but she did grow up. 
 

Q: Looking back, what was the worst part of this experience for you, t he worst 
mome nt?   Was it the time  when yo
u and your sister were hiding? 
 

A: That was one of the mo me nts.  It felt lik
e it was the end.  We 
had no place to go. 
This was the fi nality because we didn™t think we were going to see our parent s 

again.  Also, when I was separated from my
 sister with the Doblenkov family, this 
was petrifying thought for me  that I would 
be a Pole the rest of my life with a  
fa mily I don™t even know.  I have to live wi
th them and I had to live their style. 
Whatever I reme mber fr om before the war or even during the war the love, the 

affection I got from my pare
nts, it™s all gone.  I don™
t know this was one of the 
mome nts.  There were so ma ny mo ments. 
 

Q: When did you remove the cross that you wore? 

 

A: This was after the war when we were in
 Poland, when we were in Wa rsaw, just 
before we went to Berlin. 
 

 The first thing she found out that Jewish
 children, they wa
nt all the Jewish 
children in this summer  camp, and it wa
s a ma gnificent place.  It seemed like 
there was a palace over th
ere and everybody lived over there.  It was like they 
took over some thing and we lived there. 
 There were like a hundred children for a 

very short time, and we were supposed to
 be, I suppose they must have advised 
my mother to bring us there for a few m
onths to retrain our thoughts to make us  
aware that the war was over, which I refu
sed to believe.  Although I saw signs of 
the war being over, but I st
ill did not believe, I thought
 that the Germans would 
spring out from somepl ace, make a surpri
se.  I didn™t trust anybody anymore.  I 
did not believe anybody anymore.  I didn™t want to get close to anybody.  They 

tried, they worked on me  very, very hard, 
until I took the cross off, it took awhile 

  
 
31
and I think what influenced me  the most 
was when I met fr om Israel in the camp, 
there were some  young Israeli, all though th
ere was no Israel at that time, it was 
Palestine, but they came in some kind 
of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or  
whatever.  They were dressed with the 
be rets and I was so impressed when I 
looked at them and they said, you see they 
are just like you, they are also Jews. 

And these are young soldiers and this, I thi
nk, I fell in love with them the mi nute I  
saw them.  It was almo st like all of 
a sudden I discovered some thing, a goal, 
some thing different to leave my past and this
 is the future to go to Israel and to be 
just like them.  And I wanted very much to
 be just like them and this is where I 
realized I™m not Polish I™m going to go 
to Israel and I™m going to find a new 
enemy called Arabs. 
 

Q: If you had been old enough you probabl
y would have ma rried one of them. 
 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: You were still a little gi
rl.  Never went to school. 
 

A: No.  In those few months they prepared us
 that we™ll have to start going to school. 
When I was in Germany _______ we went 
to school six days a week and ma ny 
hours a day.  From morning until evening 
we were going to school, and they tried 
to put in those few years all the mi ssing years of schooling that the majority of 

kids were.  Everybody was mi ssing five y
ears of school, so you had children from 
all ages.  There were also children that 
were born in concentration camps, there 
were children that were orphaned, they 
were taken away from Polish people.  I 
met a lot of people in _____, al
so in that camp where we 
stayed right after the war 
when we came  to Wa rsaw after the war wh
en we stayed in this camp.  I also me t 
some people fr om all over and the majority
 were staying with ot her families. 
That™s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some  

of them were older already.  Some  of th
em at that time were
 like 17 or 18 years 
old.  They must have run away when th
e war was over and they came  voluntarily 
to this pl ace to fi nd themselves to know who they are. Some, maybe the families, 

the Polish families, brought them, I don™t know.  But they were like dumped. 

Before you know it within a few weeks more
 than a hundred children there.  So 
they brought all these psychologists, people 
talking to us and retraining us, trying 
to ma ke us forget the war in a way and to
 think that ther e is another life  now is 
going to start.  There™s a future. 
 

Q: So when was it you realized the war 
was over and that a new life was about to 
begin? 
 

A: When I was in that camp, that summer ca
mp.  I found it to be
 beautiful.  Because 
I found people like myself.  At first 
I thought I was the onl
y survivor on this 
planet.  This is a horribl
e thought that you think you are 
the only Jews that have 
rema ined alive and I bet there™s nobody else
, so let™s keep it
 a secret nobody has 
to know what we are.  I reme mber te
lling this to my mother, don™t tell nobody.

Q: Yet you left the camp.  Y
ou went another direction? 
 

A: Yes.  After that camp we  went to Berlin. 

 

Q: Your mother was the leader of the pact. 

 

A: Oh, yes.  She always was, she alwa
ys thought with a clear head and she knew 
exactly and was an extremely brave woma
n.  Such a br ave woma n that when I 
think back at things that 
she did I don™t know where she 
got authority.  I™ve never 
come  across anybody else like that.  With su
ch impact, with such go in her, like 
nothing could stop her.  Yes, in time s 
of desperation you pick up strength you 
never knew you had and courage or you die fr
om fear or else you turn the other 
way around and you become  extremely courage
ous.  Life is so important that you 

will do anything to survive. 
 

Q: I would have loved to have me t her. 

 

A: She was some thing.  She was very, ve
ry loved, she had so ma ny friends here. 
 

Q: And those who came to Am
erica and the three of you? 
 

A: Well the originally I did not want to come to America.  My goal was to go to 
Israel . 
 

Q: With the other kids? 
 
A: Well that wasn™t with the other ki ds.  
I was in Germany at that time.  This was 
already almost four years later and I re
me mber they were always coming from 
Israel.  They were comi ng to train us.  
To train us to become  young soldiers.  How 
to protect yourself, and I was going thr
ough all this training and I was ready to 
become a soldier. 
 

Q: You were seventeen years old. 

 

A: Didn™t ma ke no difference, I was ready to
 run away from my mother and to go 
there, and she said ﬁyou™re not going now
hereﬂ.  And I reme mber a few of my  
friends went on the ship Exodus and I wa
s supposed to be on it and my mother  
caught me  the last mi nute.  She said 
you are not going.  Afte
r going through a war 
like this you™re not going to get shot by an
 Arab.  We  are going to America.  At 
that time , of course, I was trained Hebr
ew, I was taught Hebrew in Germany, it 

was a language  It was supposed 
to unite us all.  I said, 
but I don™t speak a word of 
English but I do speak Hebrew, so I™ll be at
 home in Israel and all my friends here 
from the camp are going and I want to 
go there too.  My mother forbid me , you 
are not to go by yourself, we 
are all going together.  We  
have relatives in America 
and this is where we are going. 
 And sure enough we came here.

Q: Anyregrets? 

 

A: No.  I go to Israel every opportunity I ha
ve.  I™ve been there many times, at least a 
thousand. 
 

Q: Well, on behalf of the United States 
Holocaust Museum, I thank you for your time 
and for your story. 
 

A: You™reverywelcome.
