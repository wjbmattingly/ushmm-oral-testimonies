W ebegin with this portrait of  SusanT aubeborn Susan Strauss. Susan grew up in a

hand side with the storefront.
 
 
Here we see Susanand her m other,Bertha Strauss, together in af ield near their

In Novem ber, 1938, the Nazis unleasheda wave of  Pogrom s throughout Germ any 
known as Kristallnachtor the Nightof  BrokenGlass. T his shows Germ anspassing the broken

>> S
usanT aube:  Need sunglasses.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you so muchfor being wil ling to be our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on

to have to avoid looking at the heavensf ora little bithere.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Good morning.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Last year you were unable to join usbecause your timeto be with us was right 

af ter thedeathof  Herm an. W e're so glad to have you here this year. T hank youfor doing this.
 
You have som uch to tell us. W e're going tostart right away.  
 

 
You were just 7, living in your hom etown of  Vacha in Germ any when Hitler cam e to 
power in 1933. Af terthat,of  course, your lif e and your fam ily's lif e changed.  Start by telling us 

a little bit about your fam ily's lif e in the years that led up to Kristallnacht in November
 
19 38 , 
th o
se years before that.  By thetim e Kristallnacht happened in1938you were already 12 
years old. 
 
>> SusanT aube:  I was 12 years old. W ell, Iwas born in a sm all town, 5,000 people. W ehad 

a general store whereyou could buy everythi ng to s
e
wing m achine,baby carriage, whatever 
was necessary.  Because the surrounding area was m ostly agricult ur
al
. T his was the business 
endof  the little town.
 
 
T hings were norm al. W ehad anormal life with ourneighbors. As children, we were 
invited for Christmas, birthday parties, whatever was celebrated. W e were alwa ys in vited.  

And the sam ehappened theother way.  For our holidays we in vited our neighbors.
  
Everyt hing 
was just f ine until 1933 when Hitler came to power.  
 

 
T hings just changed rapidly.
  
H
e had speeches against the Jewish people, Jews are 
our downf all. Everythi ng was blam ed on theJews
 
what went wrong in Germ any.  After all,it 
was af ter W orl
dW arI. The econom y wasn't a very good one. People didn't have work.  It was 
a tough life at that tim e.  But Hitler blam ed everything on the Jews.  So naturally people started 

to believe it
.  S
tarted to bediscrim inated against andboycotted. T he store
 
was boycotted.  
T hey put people inuniform . As soonas he was elected, people in uniformed stayed inf ront 
of  

the stores with a big sign " D
on't buy f rom Jews,"  
ﬁ
Jews are our downf all.
ﬂ
  
T hat's how itwent

on and on and on f orever. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henIf irst met you,alm ost 16 years ago, you toldm eabout theSchoen 
fam ily andthey had gone to vote. W ould
 
yo u
 
tell m e about that?
 
>> SusanT aube: T here were elections.W hen Hitler cam etopower, he was elected legally.  

But whenhe went to the places afterwards, you received a littlepin. You voted yes or no.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  F o r Hit le r.
 
>> SusanT aube:  ForHitler or against Hitler. Yes or no
.
  
So everybody voted yes because 
--
 
even the Jewish people because we didn't know what was in storefor us, t
he future.
 
 
So lif e wentonfor a while.  It wasn't too much change but soonenough people in 
thebrown shirts and their unif orm s stayed infront of the stores with big signs to boycott the 

store. And people weren't allowed to com e into the store. So to m ake a living m y f ather
 
--
 
a t 
onetim e he had a car. He had to give it up. He went ona bicycle in the neighborhood, 

religious, the sym bols of m erchandise, triedto do business this way, took orders.  And then he 

delivered. 
 
It was a very tough life atthat time.  Nota very happy lif e, really.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint you and yoursister were sent to go to school in another town.
 
>> SusanT aube:  I went to school in that townf orfour years, whatwas elem entary school.  

Af terfour years I graduated
 
f rom  there and went to what was a gym nasium . Theeducational 
system  in Germ any is different thanhere.  Itwas like a m iddle school. We learned languages.  

It was a niceeducation but I was completely ignored, com pletely separated f rom all the other 

st u
dents. I wasn't allowed to participate in any activities whatsoever.  I was in that schoolfor 
about two years.  I don't know if m y parents, if m y m ental situation or whatever
;  
told Ihad to 
leave the school.  
 
 
Anyhow, I was sent away from  m y hometown to
 
Frankfurt
 
a m  M a im
,to a Jewish day 
school. I lived there wi th strangers. My parents had to pay.  It was a private school. T hey had 

to pay f orm y food and lodging andfor the school.
 
 
I lived with these people.  Actually it was nice until 1938 when the 
Kristallnacht 
cam e.  It was organize d by the government. T he reasonfor it was
 
--
 
about afew m onths 
bef ore, we had the Jewish citi zens who were notGerman citizens yet but lived in Germ any f or 

qu i t e
 
a long tim ealready.  Their children were born in Germ any butthey came and just picked 
them  up, deportedthem  to the border of Poland and just left them there.  Andamong these 

people, a couple whose son was studying in Paris. W hen hef oundout what happenedtohis 

parents, I guess he wanted tobring theattention of the world to what's happening.  Foolishly 

he went to the Germ an Embassy in Paris with a gun,tried to kill theGerm an Am bassadoror 

threatened him  or whatever.  But they wouldn't let him  in.  So the secretary was inf rontof his 

off iceand he took out a gun and shotthatm an. 
 
He lingered onf orabout three days bef ore he 
died.  
 

 
During that date they organized which was later calledKristallnacht. I was in 
Frankf urt, lived with a fam ily in anapartm ent. Novem ber
 
9,  10 ,  
ho r de s
 
of people in civi
lia n  
clothes came to the apartm ent just knocking down thedoor, not ringing the bell or anything.  

Co m in g in  
with sledgehammers, sticks and whatever. T hey demolishedthe whole apartment.
 
 
Af ter they lef t, we didn't have a cuptodrink coff eef rom ,a plate
 
to eat f rom , nothing.  
Nothing.  It was wintertim e already. W e hadfeatherbeds that were sliced open,thrown outof  

windo ws.  Plants werethrown outof  windows.  The wholeapartm entwas damaged.  And they 

went f rom one apartment to theother. T here were
 
quite af ew Jewi shf am ilies living in the 
building.
 
 
And then they left. W e were just stunned, couldn'tbelieve what happened here. It 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

was cleanedup.W e cleaned it up. And we went out tof ind new dishes, I guess. That'show it 
wa s .
 
 
In the evening the Gestapo cam eand arrested all malepeople,m ale personsf rom  
theage of 15to65. They were all deported to concentration camps in Germany.
  
A t tha t tim e  
we had three cam ps, Stutthof ,Buchenwald, and
 
Riga.  You were deported tothese 
concentration cam p
s . 
 
 
T he schools were closed.  The school was also dem olished. T he schools were 
closedbecause themale teachers were arrested.T hef em ale teachers, I guess they didn'tf eel 

like teaching either.  It was just an upheaval. You couldn't concentrate on any
thing.
 
 
So I wentback tom y hom etown which was Vacha.  I came home. My f ather was 
gone. W hat happened there? T he police cam etom y house andmy m otheranswered the 

door.  The police sa
id," I have to bring ina body.
  
If your husband doesn't give him sel
f  u p , I 
have to take you in.  I have tobring in a body.
ﬂ
  
Som y father gave him self  up.  He was 
escorted by him self wit h the policeman to theBuchenwald concentration camp.  He was there 

forf our weeks. He was let go because he was aW orldW ar I veteran,
 
f ighting in the German 
Arm y inW orldW ar I. T hey let him go af terf our weeks.  My m otherhadto send moneyf or 

planef areand he came hom e.
 
 
He came home;
 
he was a brokenm an.  He just said
,  
ﬁW
ehave to get out of here.
ﬂ
  
It's unbelievable what people can do to people. W e cannot
 
--
 
we hope
d  
to go to Am erica.  
T hat's another story.  And we cannot wait for America to send usthe papers.  W ehave toget 

out of  here. 
 

 
W ell, that wasn't that easy.  As I said, we tried toem igratef rom  the time of  1936 but 
we
 
didn't have any closefam ily in Am erica. You had tohave som ebody in Am erica to vouch 
for you.  You couldn'tfall on the government. People hadtohave money in the bank tom ake 

sure that they can support you.
 
 
S o  f am ily
 
--
 
f inally we found a relative o
f  a re la t ive .  He
 
saidhe would vouchfor m y 
father, let him  come f irst
; o
nce he's established andf inds a job, afacility to li ve, we wil l help 
you, wil l f indhelpf or thef am ily to com eover.
 
 
W ell, that was in1936.  So whenthe papers cam e, he called the embassy in Berlin, 
the American Em bassy and asked how long it could takef orhim .  Because they received a 

number. Once the papers came to the Off iceof  the em bassy, you received a number. Sohe 

called up andfoundout how long it would take. T hey said it can take two to three years. W hy 

two to three years?  You have to wait and do thebest you can. 
 
 
W ell ,  i n  t h e me a nt i m e,  c a m e t o  S t ut t hof
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told us yourf ather,of  course, had given him self upand then came out of  

the concentration camp.  He wouldm ake hiswa y to Belgium .
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah.  Hehad to leave Germ any.  He couldn't stay in Germany.  T hat was 

oneof  the conditions that he was dism issedalso.  So he
 
--
 
he had to pay som ebody to take 
him  over the border.  He wound up inBelgium.  A lot of peoplehad the sam e problem. T he 

Jewish com munity in Belgium helped the people. T hey couldn't work but would give them  

food, lodging, etc. 
 
 
He was in Belgium forabout six m onths when thenotice cam ef romBerlin
,  
f rom  the 
em bassy in Berlin
,  
that he should com eand get hispapers sohe could em igrate to Am erica.
 
W ell, since he was in Belgium ,he couldn't com e back toGermany.  Sothe papers went over to 

Belgium  and that prolonged the whole process for alm osta whole year.
  
During the year then 
the war brokeoutbut he made it outf rom Belgium  before Germ any invaded the lowlands in

1940, inthe spring of  1940.  He left in February of  1940f orAmerica.
 
 
As soon ashe came to America, he preparedthepapersf orus.  And again the 
sam e process.  Back to the em bassy in Berlin. T he number again. And waiting again. And in 
them eantim ethe warbroke out.W ell, the war was there. America was not in the war yet.
 
 
So we m oved
 
--
 
inthem eantim e, we were the last Jewish f
am ily t o  live  in  t h e  lit t le  
town.  They m ade lif ever y m iserablefor m y m other. I was in Frankfurt in the school withm y 

sister at thattime. They m ade lif e very m iser able. She had to sell the house.
 
 
Also, after Kristallnacht, everything was conf iscatedf rom  the Jewish people. All of  
our bankbooks,everyt hing that we had, what we owned, was conf iscated.  W e received only 

enough money to liveon, actually. 
 
She soldthehouse andnever received the money 
because them oney went in the sam ebank. W emoved to Berlin. Hoping, hoping toem igrate 

to Am erica.T o theembassy in Berlin to move toAmerica. 
 
 
W ell,  Be rlin
 
--
 
again, alot of the small towns the Jewish people justcouldn't live 
anym ore. They were discrim inated against. T hey weren't safe with their lives anym ore. Alot 

of  people moved to bigger cities andm y m other decided Berlin.
 
 
So we came to Berlin.W e received a Jewish apartm ent which belonged to a 
gentleman. His job was correspond
en t
 
for aGerm an newspaper. But he lost his job in1935 
wh
en all other Jewish people losttheir jobs who workedf orthe governm ent orhad any 
positions of  im portance
 
like  mu sicia n s, t ea che rs,  in
 
regular schools.  They all lost their jobs at 
th a t tim e. 
 

 
So he hadanapartm ent.  And in thisapartmenthe lived he had one room . Another 
lady li ved there. T hey had a room . W e were four people. W ehad one bedroom, a comm unal 

living room , bathroom,and kitchen. T hat's where we lived.
 
 
Schoolat that time, I really don't rem em ber if I went back.  If I went back to sch
ool, 
by that tim e I was 14, I can't really rem ember.  If  I went back, it was a very short tim e.
 
 B
y the way, I'm  14 years old.  I had to go to work. W hat was the work? W e had to 
work in an oldage hom e, myself , with elderpeople. They had nom orefam ilies or whatever.  

W ehad totake careof the oldpeople because the younger people, the regular people who 

worked there, who were supposed to work there, they hadto work in thef actory f orthe war 

eff o rt.
 
 
My girlf riend was with m e at thetim e. W e worked with old people. W etook care of 
them . W ecooked.W e cleaned. W e washed. W hatever we had to do.  Once these people 

got sick and were taken out f rom  thehom e,they never cam e back.W enever saw them  again.
 
 
So eventually thathome was closed. My next
 
job was in adaycare center where, 
again, the parents of  children hadto go work in thef actoriesf orthewar eff ort. T he children 

were dropped off 6:00
 
in the morning. W ehad to bethere 6:00
 
in the morning until8:00
 
a t 
night
 
an
d the last childwas picked up. 
 
So we took care of the children.  It was sad, very sad 
actually.  But it was seven days a week we had to work. 
 

 
All right.  So that was our job.  For a while.  And then by thetim e I was closeto15, 
15
 
1/2,I was pulledoutf rom there also and Ihadto go to work for the war effort also.  I was 
placed with m y m other.  I hadto work in afactory where they madeparts f or U
-B
oats.  W e 
were in assembly lines.  The Jewish people were separatef rom  theGerm an people. The 

Germ an people received their
 
lunches there,food, andeverything.  T he Jewish people 
received nothing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Iwant theaudiencetounderstandthat you were not at all paidf orany of  

that. T his is allforced labor.

>> SusanT aube: T hat was f orced labor.  Butthey pa
id
 
--
 
they hadto pay the government.  
T he governm ent took them oney away. 
 
 
Also, when the war started, everything became rationedfor everybody.  But Jewish 
people received special cards with a J on it,ever y couponhad a J on it.  This reduced calories.
  
And we could only doour shopping between4:00
 
and 6:00
 
in the afternoon. W e were not 
allowed in any storeother than those two hours. 
 
 
Not all Germ an people were, how should I say, f ollowing the rulesexactl y. W ehad, 
thank God, a nice grocery across
 
the streetf rom us.  He knew of  what was going on.  And 
sin ce  w
e hadto work,he always kept som ething in reserve f orm y mother when we came 
home f rom  work. 
 

 
So we worked in thef actory, took public transportation. By thattim e we had already 
our Jewish
 
star on ourclothes.  It wasn'ta pleasant way to go to wor k in the morning, to be 
branded with the Jewish star. You don't know who you're sitting next to or standing next to. 

You never know what a person can do to you. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Af ter spending tim e in Berlin,bef ore long, though, you would bedeported to 

Riga.  T ell us what happened inthe process of deporting you.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Deportation started. I think it was September, October of 1941. T hem an 

we li ved with had adaughter who had just
 
gottenm arried.  Not a young wom ananym orebut 
she gotm arried. T hey m oved to about a halfan hour transportationaway.  He tried to callher 

oneday and there was no answer.  Called, called, called, called, noanswer.  Af teraf ew days 

he receiveda cardf rom  Poland, "Dear Father, dueto circum stances we had no control over, 

we were resettledto this placehere. Don't worry. W e aref ine. You will hear f rom us again."   

T hat was the only card he received.  Henever heardf rom them again. 
 
 
T he next came
 
m y girlf riend who had a beautiful apartment notf arf rom us either.  
T hey received an official postcard
, 
dear so
-
a nd
-
so, due to our diff icult situations right now, we 
have tobring our Germ an citizensf rom theeast into the
 
--
 
you will be settled.  You can take 
with you whatever you can carry.  If  you have any bigger item s you would like to take, you 

have todrop them  offat a certainplace and it will be shipped to your new destination. You 

have to reportat this and this time to thisand this place. Th
is  is  it .
  
S o  s he  l ef t.   
 
 
I went to say goodbye to her.  I gave hera note, I said, wherever you com e,put it in 
thef irstm ailbox you see.  Maybe whenour tim e comes we can seeeachother again.
 
So they left and I never heardf rom her. 
 
 
Our time cam e in
 
January, beginning of  January.  It was the sam em essage.  You 
can take what you want, what you can carry, etc.,etc. And you be ready January
 
25.  You wil l 
assembleat this and this place.  You will be resettled. 
 
 
Ok. T he time cam e. My m other packed
 -- 
she liked to sew, so she had anice 
sewing m achine. Shef igured if I get to a new place, maybe I can do something with it, take 

the sewing m achine
, 
pots andpans, blankets, pillows, pots andpans, and we shle
p
pe d
 
i t  o ve r  
in the wagon to the place which was designated to drop it off whichwas a Jewish day school at 

onetim e.  In the courtyard of that school we dropped everything off. Just put your nam e onit.  

W e de live r it .

apartm entfor the settlem ent. You know
:  I
t costs money. W eneedyour bankbooksand 
whatever yo

her ownf ree will she'sgiving it f or the cost tothe resettlem ent to wherever we were supposed 
to go. Butthat time we didn't know where we were going.  So she signed the p
apers.  T hey 
tookall the bankbooks, wedding rings, watches
;  
whatever we still had they took away.  T hat's 
it.  Allf or the costof  the resettlement. 
 
 
So we went to theplace.  W e tookpublic transportation. It stood between two 
houses that couldn't be burneddown whenm ostof the synagogues were burnt down.  

Because it was between two houses, it was dem olished insidebutthere were benches there.  

So we went in there.
 
 
Slowl y, slo wl y, the place filledup. A lot of people cam e in. Saturday m orning there 
was the Gestapo again.  There were big tables. T hey calledbenchby bench, calleddownand 

gi ve our nam e.  Do you have any ID cards? Do you have any money lef t?  Do yo
u have 

anything left? You have to leave it here. 
 
Soby that tim e we
 
relinquished our only
 
--
 
what we 
still had that's who we are.  
 
 
Af ter Kristallnacht, everybody had to give up their passports.W e couldn't keep any 
p a sspo rt s.
  
If you were lucky to em igrate, you had to pay 10,000 marks just to get out of the 
country
, t
o get yourpassport back.
 
 
So they took the last ID away f rom  us. T hen we f ound out that wewould be 
resettled to Riga,Latvia.  At least we knew where we were going. 
 

 
So cam e Sunday morning, ver y, very earl y.  Weallhad to assem ble on the street.  
T here were trucksfor people who couldn't walk. W e hadto walk to the railroad station which 

was the suburb of Berlin.  And we arrived there. W e lookedf or thetrain to take us. W hat we 

sa w 
was the cattle cars.  Like you see in theMuseum  here.
  
They opened thedoors.  Inside 
the cattle cars were benchesm adeout of  straw.  On thef loor was straw.  On each side of the 

walls were a bucketf or your physical needs. No water, nofood, nothing. 
 

 
W hen the wagons were filled,about1,000people,off  we went. 1942 was a very, 
ver y cold winter.  T here was no heat in this wagon, nothing. So wesat close together, 

actually.  Somany people in there.
  
Anyhow, we arri ved in Riga after about threedays
.   T he  
doors were opened.  
ﬁ
Out,out, out.  Out,everybody out.
ﬂ
  
There were trucks,m ilitary with guns 
and dogs. 
 
"O
u t,  
E
verybody out."  Everybody assembled.  
ﬁ
If  you can walk, you have to walk 
aboutf ive kilometers to your new destination.  If  you cannot
 
walk, you can use the
ﬂ 
transportation
 Œ  ﬁ
the trucks here and we take you there.
ﬂ 
W ell, theelderly people who got out, 
m others with children,they used thef acility of thetrucks. W eneversaw them again. 
 
 
W e walked
.  M
y grandm other, m other, m y sister 
andm yself , we walked.  There was 
ice.  Everything was ice, very, ver y diff icult towalk, holding on to each other not tof all.
 
 
Finally we arri ved in the place, houses surrounded by chicken wire,doublef ences of  
chicken wires, m ilitary guns every f ew steps. W ecame into the gate and showed us where to 

go.  Into thishouse they pushed quite afew people.  By that tim e itwas already dark. W e 

couldn't see very m uch.  We just sat there.  No heatagain, no water, nothing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto com ebackto youmentionedthe ice.  W hen you went into the little 

place they put you, even thereeverything wa s coated in ice.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Everything.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he tables, everything was c oated in ice.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Everything.  Ever ything.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  A solid wall of  ice.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Everything was ice. W ehad no water, nothing,no toilets, nothing.
 
 
So anyhow, we waited until light. W e woke up. W e wentoutside tolook around a

little bit. W esee clothes all over the place,f rozenf ood on the tables, f rozen everything was 
f rozen.W e didn't know what was happening.
 
 
So anyhow, this was the Riga ghetto.  Into this ghetto wentthe populationf rom  
Riga
, 
the Jewish population of Riga. T hey were concentrated there. Af ter Germany invaded 
Ru ss ia ,  

they invaded Latvia, too. T he Jews were righ t away also takentothis place, leaving their 

apartm ents and concentrate in the thatplace.
  
There were two big
 
--
 
what was lef tof all of  
these people was 400m en and 100 women.T hat's all. 
 
 
W e came 
in this placeandm y feet were f rozen.  I couldn't even walk.  I couldn't 
stand up.  It was terrible.  Buteventually a man was in charge of thebuilding and he cam eto 

our apartment, up to our room, and toldus you have to go to work.  If  you don't go to work, you 

don't get anything to eat.  You have to get apieceof  bread, you have to work. 
 

 
So Iput onm y shoes that I could hardly get intobecausem y feet were really bad. 
W ecame out of the house. W ehad to assemble ina certain place. From  there we
 
received a 
slice of  bread.  And we were picked up by soldiers and takento thecity of  Riga where we had 

to clean up the sidewalk f rom  ice and snow so thepopulation could walk onthe sidewalks. W e 

were not allowed to do that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your job was literally to chip the ice off the sidewalks.
 
>> SusanT aube:  And clear them.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were not allowed to walk on the sidewalks.
 
>> SusanT aube:  No.W e had to walk in thestreets.
 
 
So they tookus back to the ghetto but therewas hardly a
nything
 
--
 
I don't even 
rem em ber how we li ved, how we survi ved the few weeks.  I cannot rem ember it.  But this went 

onfor quite a while until it got warm er. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Susan, I know we won't have tim etoday for you totell us a lot about your tim e 

in the Riga ghetto butyou were theref oralmost 20 months.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think f rom  February
 
1942 toAugust or Septemberof 1943.  Andduring that 
tim e you were made to doa lotof very diff icult jobs. Before you tell us about
 
leaving the 
ghetto,tell usabouta couple of the other jobs besides picking the ice that you were m ade to 

do. One of them  I remem ber is you had to go dig peat out.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Peat moss.  It was the summ er of 1943.  Ihad a job actually at thattim
e a t  
the German Air Forcewhich was not toobad, I have to say so. BecauseI had somef ood 

there. So the rations m y m other could usef rom the ghetto and Iate there.
 
 
T here cam e a tim e when they took young people to dig peatm oss in Latvia.  Peat 
m oss was usedfor burning.  It was material they burned in theovens, usedf or cooking, etc., 

e tc. 
 
The job was to dig it out. There was awhole m achinery there that it went through the 
m achine
, t
he conveyor belts.  The stuff was put on planks, then on the belt.  From  thebeltwe 

hadto carry it into them eadows and turn it over f rom time to time so it dries off  so it couldbe 

burned. 
 
 
T his was a job wherewe were outside the ghetto. W e were young people.W e had 
an area where we could go swim m ing. W e didn't have a bathing suit but we weren't asham ed 

to go swim m ing anywa y.  T hat lastedfor about six, seven weeks.  And we went back to the 

ghetto.
 
 
At that tim e in 1943, there was theuprising in the ghetto, uprising already.  I guess 
the Germans were af raid it could happenalsoin other places, whichactually at onetim e there 

was a resistance in our ghettobut they were c aught. They killed them  all
.

>> Bill Benson:  You were f orced to watch peoplebe hanged.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Oh,yeah.  If  you were lucky, you worked outside the ghetto.  There were 
com passionate people sometimes that gaveyou som ething to eat. But it was very dangerous 

to bring it back into ghettobecause you were searched lots of tim es. T hey took you off onthe 

street, stopped you and searched you.  Before you entered the ghetto you were searched. 

And if theyf ound anything on you that you weren't supposed to have, they took you r
ight to the 
cem etery and you were shot. So that happened quite often. 
 
 
At one tim ethere was working in theharborunloading boats,f oodfor themilitary, 
which was stationed there.  Andthere were som e young m en. There one time came lem ons.  

T he y f i gu r
ed, oh, that's a good thing to sell inthe ghettofor bread, changefor bread or 
whatever.  Put them  in their pockets.T hey were caught.  And six of the guys, they hung them .  

W eallhad to march by theretoteach usa lesson not to bring homeanything to
 
the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkin late summ er1943 you were broughtback into the ghetto.  You told 

m ethat you sortof  knew
 
--
 
I think your words were " I sort of knew what theball game was by 
thattim e" andf rom  there you were sent thento a concentration camp.
 
>> SusanT aube: T heghetto was slowl y, slowl y l iquidated. Therewas al ways aktion going 

on. W ehad two hospitals.  People got sick.  If
 
--
 
there was som em edication available but still 
thedoctors, we haddoctors, they did the best they c
ould. 
 
 
From  the hospitals, if  you were there more than af ew days and you couldn't go back 
to work, you just were elim inated. T hat was it. T hey were alwa ys go ing on
 
--
 
what's that thing 
M
a rc h
 
--
 
March 14I think. T hey cam e
 
--
 
we had a lotof  older peop
l e s t i l l  i n  t h e gh e t to .  T hey 
cam e totheirapartm ents where the elderly people were.  They said, you know, we f ound a 

new placef or you where you canbe working in good conditions and you wil l bef ed there;wh y 

don't you register to go there.  So people were happy to leave the ghetto. They said
: W
hat  c a n  
be worse than that
?
  
W hen they lef t, we never saw them again. Itwas just the camouf lage.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Andf rom  there you would end up being sent to Kaiswer wald and end up,I 

think,at a subcamp. Tell us about going there.
 
>> SusanT aube: T heghetto was liquidated. W eall were sent, thepeople still ableto work, 

were sent toKaiswerwald.  It was already a concentration cam p. T hey were barracks, three 

high, three people toeach plank, very little food.  Concentration cam p lif e.  Up in them orning, 

5:00, to be counted, tobe counted, and stay out there inthe rain, sunshine, whatever it was.  
 

 
And some people were lucky they still could go to work.  Some people could not.
 
I have to say I was lucky.
  
I was picked out to go to a place called Meteor where
 
--
 
we had 
housing there. Af ter work we did not go back to Kaiswer wald. W ehad a place to sleep there.  

T hey arranged
 
--
 
we were 100 wom en. Andour job was in that place
 
--
 
it was af actory where 
th
ey used toproduce tires, rubber boots,etc. Thefacility was outside Riga.  One of the 
warehouses was m ade into living quarters f orthehundred women.W ehad bunk beds there.  

Actually ever ybody had their own bunkbed,which was ver y nice.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  Yourm other and sister?
 
>> SusanT aube:  No. My m other and sisterwent to different places and I never saw them  

again.  I knew where they were but I never saw them again. 
 
 
Our job was to repair platoon boats where they cross ri vers, the m ilitary.  And when 
they were shot up, they cam e to thisplace. W efixed them  up. 
 
The job was adirty job 
because inside there were snakes and whatever went inside theboatsf rom the rivers. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  And you were dealing with very toxic glues.  It was a horr
ib le  job .
 
>> SusanT aube: T heglue was ver y to xic.  I don't know what it was.
  
So they ga ve us m ilk to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
stop the coughing, nauseated andall of  that;
 
so they provided a little m ilk.
 
 
T he place was not toobad.  W e were not som uch under the gun there becau
se  i t  
was under civilian control.  Actually m ilitary al so but the overseer was a m ilitary m anf rom  
Germ any.
  
Food, we hadfood enough to live, let
™s
 
put it this way.  N ot too m uch.  No 
delicacies,nothing.  Soup, soup, soup, potato soup,potato, that's it.
  
And bread. 
 
 
In thisplace we were for quite a while. T hen
 
--
 
what was good in this place
 
--
 
I  wa s  
lucky, actually.  From  f ixing these boats they hadtobepainted. Sothree girls were chosen to 

paintthese boats. T hat was in a big room , with big windows.  So we hadf resh air. W e could 

open the windows. W e painted the boats. 
 
 
T he other thing was, there was the 
o
f f i c e  of
 
--
 
who was it? W ho responsiblefor this 
place. There was a radio.  T here was newspapers. Andf or some reason they left the radio
 
o n 
all thetim e and we heard news that things aren't going so goodfor the German Arm y.  The 

Arm y was al ways on a successf ul retreat. T hat was m usic to our ears.  The successful retreat 

didn't comefast enough.  It cam e June
 
--
 
June?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Summer 1944 you were evacuated. 
 
>>
 
SusanT aube: T heSS cam efrom concentration Kaiswer wald, picked us up.  In the 
m eantim e,also, we received our striped clothing.  They preparedus for evacuation,I guess, 

for going back to Kaiswer wald.  Until then we had our own clothes, actually. 
 

 
T hey cam e and picked us up, back to Kaiswer wald.  Back toKaiswer wald
.  F
ro m 
Kaiswer wald about two weeks, we were transported tothe harbor inRiga, put on the boat and 

shipped off to concentration
 
--
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  You were jam med, 
you told m e
, 
lik e  s a r
dines
 i
nto the barges.
 
>> SusanT aube: Like sardines.  At that tim enotonly the concentration camp but all the work 

cam ps were located around the place came to thisboat. T hey were  all evacuated at the sam e 

tim e on one boat. W e were just like sardines 
on thatboat. W ecouldn't sitdown.  Just 

standing up. No toiletfacilities, nothing.  I just can'tpictureanym ore how we sur vi ved really.
 
 
T his journey, the boat lef t.  I don't know because we didn't know if it was day or 
night, whatever it was. W earrived in a place. They unloaded us. T here was a big m eadow.  

T hey said
,  ﬁG
e t o ut, out, o ut, ou t.
ﬂ
  
So we gotoutf rom the boat andwe were sitting there on a 
m eadow.  Nothing aroundus. Absolutely nothing buta littlehill going through.
 
 
So eventually when there appeared
 
--
 
what do
 
yo u
 
call thesethings? W here you 
transport coal in, barges, barges.  Into the barges they pushedus. They couldn't standup. 

W ehad to crouchbecausethere was no standing room . And when we get out, we came to 

S tu tth of.  
W e looked at each other, we were all black.  Because inthese barges they 
transported coal andother things, too. W e couldn'teven recognize each other anym ore. 
 
 
From  there they m arched us tothe concentration cam p, exterm ination camp called 
S tu tth of.  B
ig sign, live f lowers, beautiful landscaping. W ell, you walked infor about 100, 
200
 
yards, you saw barracks, fence, stones,nothing.  People walking around, walking, 
huddling.  A terrible sight. 
A
nd, again we wer e pushed in thebarrack. T he barracksha
d t hr e e  
layers, up, justplanks.W e lived on theseplanks.
 
 
In them orning was out
 
--
 
outf rom  thebarracks.  There was a trum pet to wake us 
up. If  we were sleeping.  W ehad to get up. W eassem bled outside of  thebarracks. W e were 

f ive in a row deep,f ive deep, long ro
ws
. W ewere counted.  Counted and countedand 
countedfor about two hours becauseat thattim e there was the SSandthere were SS ladies 

there.T hey were wors e than them en. Very inhum an beings, horrible. W e stayed there until 

they dism issed us. W e received a slice of breadand som eblack coff ee if  you had a contain

to  
put it in.  If you didn't, you were outof  luck. 
 
 
W ejust went on.  I was therefor two weeks. I must say I was lucky to get outof  
there. One day they countedout 500 wom en and walked us outof  the cam p and to atrain, a 
regular train actually
, a
nd transportedus by train to aplace what welaterf ound out the nam e.  
So we arrived there. We got out of the trainandthey marched us to a camp. The campwas 

again surrounded by chicken wire, little hutsm ade outof  plywood. Intothese huts15 people 

hadto go.W e each received two little blankets. T hat was itf or thefirst day I rem ember. 
 
 
So we were f ive girls.  We kind of kept together all the time. In them orning we had 
to go to work.  T he work was
 
--
 
f irst we received a piece of bread before we went to work.  T he 
work was they took down the trees.  It was a rural sectionof the country.  T hey took down the 

trees. Our job was todig out the rootf rom  the trees,
 
p ut  t hem
 
--
 
push them toa certain place.  
I don't know how thatworked anym ore exactly.  And em ptied them out.T hen they were 

pushed back up thehill again andf illed up again. T hat was our job. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Diggin g out the roots of the trees.
 
>> 
SusanT aube:  Yes.  In the meantim e, we were f ull of li
c
e. W ehad nofacilities to wash 
ourselves. W e had no showers, 
nothing anym ore. W herever we went,there was just lice. 
 
 
One thing what happened there, there was supposedtobe training groundf ort
h e 
Germ an Arm y, what they were building there.  Had to build boatsand houses. 
 
I becam e a 
brick layer af ter a
 
while. T hey needed people for this job. So the younger people they took for 
brick laying and olderpeople out to the woods. T hat lastedfor qu
it e a  wh ile  u n t il it  go t  co ld 

and we couldn'tdig anym ore, couldn'tdoanything anym ore. W e had no heat in this littlehut.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, these were plywood huts, no heating.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Noheating.  No water either.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this was in the winter of 1944 and 1945 which was a particularly brutal 

winter.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Before nightf all, yeah.  Eastern Germ any it was c old.  No heat,no water.  

T here was only one water, a big pum p where we could get water.  Again, if you had a 

container, you had water.  If not, you had nowater.  T oothbrush, we had a little
 
--
 
somehow we 
saved a littlepieceof  soap. W e brushed our teeth with soap.  No toothbrush, nothing. 
 
 
Anyhow, the wintertime we couldn't do anything, couldn't work anym ore. T hey didn't 
know what to do with us.  We stayedthere. They tookus thentoone of the unf inished houses 

andput us in the basem ent. There was no heateitherbut it was wa rm er than thehuts. 
 
Oneday they came tous and said
: W
ell, we cannot stay here, the Russian Arm y is com ing 
closer. W e have to goback to Stutthof .
 
 
So they assem bled usand toldus if  you canwalk, it's about120
 
k i l o m et e r s  from  
here, you can walk.  Ifyou cannot walk, you stay here and somebody wil l take careof  you. 
 
W e ll ,  t h e
 
one
s 
who stayed behind, we never saw again. W e walked.  
 
 
Ever y day we walked so many kilom eters.  Atnight they pushed us in 
a barn.  If  we 
found som ef oodalong the way, we were lucky.  Som etim es peopleprovided potatoesor 

som ething f or us while we wa
lked. W ater, we had snow along the way.  Eat the snow for 

water.  And if youf ell behind, you were shot. You couldn'tfall behind.
 
 
And that march lastedabout 10 days. W ecam eto a place, Buchenwald, the cam p 
with barracks.  Before we cam e, there were English POW shousedthere. I don't know wh ere 

they tookthem .T hiswas our pointof  restf or a while.  So we stayed thereforabout two, three 

weeks.  Very little food.  Iftheyf ounda deadhorse, they cooked it. Very, ver y little f ood. A 

pieceof  breadand that was all.

Cam e March 9. W e heard big, big boom s. Gunf ire.W e have to leave; we cannot 
stay here. Let's go. They didn'teven askusif  we wantedto go ornot just let's go. It was a 
rainy night. W emarched allnight. W em arched. And in them orning we came toa
 

place
 
--
 
later on we f ound out. W e cam e to a barn full of  people, dead people, sick people, 
horses, chickens. T hey pushedus inthere and they closedthedoor.  And that was it. 
 
 
Ca m e  m id
-
m orning we heard big, big boom s.W ethought they were  shooting into 
thebarnand eventually they would kill us.  But it wasn't to be.  It was mid
-
morning. T he doors 
were opened.  Russian soldiers were facing us.  So that was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  March 1945.
 
>> SusanT aube:  March 10, 1945.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now you're liberated by theRussians. W hatdid thatm ean?
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, liberated by the Russians. W hatdo youdo?  First you lookforf ood.  

T here was a village where the Germ an people were ready
 
--
 
running awa y f rom the Russians.  
So we went and lookedfor food.  It was such anupheaval. T hef irst food I found was 

sauerkraut. T hat wasver y good.  If  I didn't die thenand there, Idon't know.  I still like it. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Susan T aube:  Sauerkraut.  But eventually the Russians took us out f rom  there.  T hey took 

us toafarm ,a Germ anf arm  where the owners
 
--
 
I don't know if they killed them or whatever, I
 
don't know. T hey cleaned us up. Gave usf resh clothes, new clothing. W ehad to work in the 

f ields to clean thef ields f rom debris and planted potatoes, etc., what has to be planted inthe 

spring.
 
 
T hat lasted about four weeks.  Af ter the four weeks
 
--
 
the war was still going on. W e 
couldn't go anyplace else, really.  They took us
 
to
 
a place, a larger city in Germ any.  Again, 
m ost of  the population had lef t. W anted to get an apartment there.  Most of  the population left.  

W ehad to clean out the houses, what was on the walls we had to cleanout. T hat was all 

taken toa big warehouse and shipped off toRussia. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the Russians were takingever ything.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Everything out.  Yes.  Don'tf orget
;  
when Germany in vaded Russia, they
 
tookeverything the Russians had also.
 
 
T hat lastedfor a while.  W edidn't cookf orourselves. W e had like a communal 
kitchen. W hat would you call it?  Anyhow, people
 
--
 
stray dogs likeus cam e in toeat. T here 
was a Jewish m an who was in charge, a Jewish soldierf rom  Rom ania who was in chargeof  it.  

At that tim e we were six or eight survi vors. W e lived in two differentapartments. W eate 

there.W e got ourf ood there.
 
 
Oneday a young doctor came in, am edicf rom  the Russian Arm y cam e in into this 
place. He said that we are survivors and would like tom eetus. W esaid, sure, why not.  And 

oneof our girlf riends was really sick, actually. W e were happy tohave am edic with som e 

m edication to lookat them. 
 
So we m et. That was m y f uturehusband. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Herm an's story, of  course, of what he had done was an extraordinary 

story.  But hef inds you.  But to get you out ofthere, if I rem em ber right
 
--
 
>> Susan T aube:  T he Russians
 
--
 
every night  while we were under the Russians we had to 
go  
for political
 
--

hewasn't m y husbandat the tim e. He organized thehospit

about 40
 
kilom etersf rom  this place.  He came where there was abig warehouseof  
m edications and he cam e to getm edicationsfor his hospitalthere. 
  
He  wa s  s t ill in  t h e m ilit a ry.   
So we got to know each other a littlem ore. One day he said, "W

lik e  t o c om e  wit h

S
u re

It wasn't that easy to get out of there. You had tobribe some people to get outof  
there. One day he cam e.  He brought a lotof  vodka.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  And kielbas
a if  I  r em em be r  r i ght . 
 
>> SusanT aube:  And gave it to som eof  theRussian soldiers there.  He coveredm e up.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likeastretcheror som ething?
 
>> SusanT aube:  A stretcher, covered me up.  Hetoldthem  that I'm  very sick and he has to 

take 
m e to the hospital.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> SusanT aube:  He took m e away to the hospital. 40
 
k i l om e te r s  awa y.  
 
 
Sof rom  therehe wasstill in theArm y buteventually the Russian Arm y evacuated 
f rom  there. T he place was gi ven to Poland,thatpart of Germ any was
 
given to Poland. W e 
evacuated to Berlin.
 
 
In Berlinhe was dism issed f rom  theArm y f rom  Berlin
.  W
e went toW estGermany to 
a  DP  c am p in  Be rlin
. A
t that tim e a lotof  survivors cam e to Berlinat that tim e. T here was the 
airlif t going on. W e couldn't stay in Berlin. So the American Arm y took us outf rom  there to a 

place S
ugenheim  in W
est Germ any.  T his place was a DP cam p.  Itwas barracks.  Lived like 
the concentration camp but at least we were f ree and we were clean. 
 
 
Since I was aGermanJewish citizen going back 400 years with m y ancestors I 
received anapartm entnotfarf rom  where m yfather was born. And this was a house thatused 

to belong at one tim e to Jewish people alsowho were luck y enough toem igrate toAmerica.  A 

wom an was livin g there.  A wom an with a young m an who alsof rom  Czechoslovakia.  She had 

to relinquish two rooms, give us kitchen privilege and abathroom . T hat's where we lived. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  In justthefew m om ents thatwe have lef t, yourf ather, of  course, had leftm uch 

ea
rlier to the UnitedStates.T ell ushow you connected with your f ather and came to the 

United States. 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ith m y father
 
--
 
until Am erica got into the war, we  were in touch with m y 
father.  I knew where he was living.  I kepthis address in m y head all the tim e. W e had 

nothing
 
--
 
af ew tim esalong the way there were always
 
--
 
take ever ything awa y from us. W e 
couldn't even have a piece of paper left with us.  But I kepthis address in my head.
 
 
Af ter liberationI prepared a letter that I'm  here that I'm  alive.  Idon't know what 
happened tom y m other at the tim e. I didn't know yet. 
  
If igured when Ihave an opportunity, I'll 

m ail it tom y f ather.W e were going back and forth.  It was diff icult but eventually I found an 

Am erican soldier onthe stationone time.  I gave him  this letter tomail to Am erica.
 
 
T he letter cam e
 
--
 
what If ound out later it cam eto Am erica tothe address but in the 
m eantim em y father left that place.  He wasn't thereanym ore.  For som e reason they didn't 

forward it or what happened Idon't know.
 
 
So once we settled
,  
af ter I metm y husband and we got married andsettled in a 
place in Poland, I sent another letter. By thattim e I guess thepeople knew what was

happening inEuropeand they foundm y father andforwarded
 
the letter tohim . T hat's how I 
found m y f ather.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And as a resultof  that, youwere eventually able to come to the United States. 
 
 
Susan, one last question bef ore we endtoday's program . W hendid you learn what 
happened to your mother and your sister? 
 
>> SusanT aube: W hat happened, likeI said, in Riga we were separated.  I was sent to one 
place. My sister andm other were sent toanotherplace. T hey were evacuated. T he 

whole
 
--
 
they also wer e working f or the war effort. The wholefactory was evacuated with the 
Jewish people.  But,again, the Russians cam e closer there
. T
hey were going back to Stutthof.  
I understandm y m other and my sister passed away there. 
 

 
How I f ound out, because going backtoBerlin there was a Jewish hospital
 
that was 
s
till actually workin g for som e reason. W henthepeople came backto Berlin, they went to this 

placeand registered there. W ell, it was a year later that I came back to Berlin.  Ididn'tf ind 

their names.  So later I received a letterf rom a wom an who was
 
atthe sam e place with m y 
m other. She told me that m y m other passedactually of  natural causes.  She's buried.  Yeah.  

Butm y sister, she went backtoStutthof.  She said if  you went back to Stutthof ,there was very 

badT yphus and nobody sur vived there really.  Nobody f rom  that place survi ved there.
