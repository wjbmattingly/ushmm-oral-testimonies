Question:  This is the United States Holocaust Memorial  Museum interview wit h 

Agnieszka Holland on January 18th, 2012.  Welcome to t he museum.  Thank you for 

being here.  Thank you for agreeing to speak with us toda y.  

Answer:  Thank you. 

Q:  When we do int erviews with survivors, we try to capture a life story of the person, not 
only what happened to them at the  during the Holocaust, but also to provide a context of 
what was t heir worl d li ke before all of this took place, and what happened after Holocaust 

to them.  Here we are going to do it a little bit differentl y, but follow a similar pattern 

because we would reall y like to know a lit tle bit about your family, your life, what your 

roots are, what were the forces and the factors that molded you.  So I'll start with those 

questions.  Can you tell me where you were born, when you were born and who your 

parents were, and we'll take it from there.  
A:  I was born in Warsaw, Poland on November 28th, 1948.  My mot her's name is __+.  
She married my father whose name was __+ and who was a Jew from Warsaw.  Probably 

a year or so I was born.  And the y have been  m y father spent the war in the Soviet 

Union.  He escaped Pol and when t he war started went towards the east.  He been 

involved when the Soviet forces came there.  And after he enrolled to the Soviet Army 

and from the Soviet Arm y he moved to the Polish Army in Soviet Union, which was run 

mostly by the communists, communist military.  And my father before the war for one  

Interview with Agnieszka Holland

year was a student of t he medicine in Warsaw.  I think he was pretty intelligent and 
talented man because was admitted to the medical academ y and when __+ for the Jewish 

students.  He was also in several communi st youth organi zations.  And he was very __+ 

how to tell   over spoken.  He was very __+ he was very present in the discussions in t he 
intellectual life of this Jewish yout h in Warsaw.  He was collaborat ing as a child even 
__+ when he was ei ght years old with the Jewish newspapers for the children and run by 

the children who was created by __+ with  cal led __+.  And so he participated as a young 

journalist i n the production of this newspaper.  When the war started he tried to convince 

his family to also to move to __+. I think he felt that Poland can fall in the hands of the 

Nazis and it  was dangerous.  But the y didn't feel in the same way.  

Q:  Was hi s family also  were they a well to do family?  Were they a working class 
family?  Who were your grandparents?  
A:  The y been like l ower middle class family.  My grandparent was a tailor.  They had 

enough money to educate the children, the boy.  The boy was m y fat her.  But al so m y 

aunt finished the gymnasium, the kind of  the high school.  And m y other aunt, I don't 

know exactly, but she was also  anywa y they been school ing the chil dren with education, 

was very important  for them.  But the y were not wealthy.  My grand grandmother was 

paralyzed, and she was living with them.  And it was also one of the reasons why they 
could not i magine t o move from Warsaw.   
Q:  So he had two sibli ngs?  

A:  Yes, he had two sisters. He was the only boy.  

Q:  And was he the onl y one who moved east?  

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
5 
A:  Yes, and other ones sta yed behi nd and __+ died in the war __+  except the one sister 
who survived and she escaped the ghetto in peculiar wa y.  She was transported out of the 

ghetto in t he coffin of her sister who died of pneumonia or tuberculosis so something like 

that.  
Q:  How did you hear t he story.  Did he tell you?  
A:  My aunt told me the story.  My father never spoke about it.  He died when I was 13.  

And when he was alive, he never told me about the war, nothing.  And never mentioned 

__+ family didn't know  I didn't know what name  what was the first name of m y 

grandparent s.  And after  only after his death, my aunt started to tell me those stories, but 

I think they have been in some wa y traumatized.  The y di dn't want to talk about i t.  The y 

talked among them.  My aunt  m y aunt escaped ghetto, and then she contacted one family 
friend, Polish guy was the engineer.  And he was helping not only her, but also another 
cousin, two cousins, young girls who escaped from Vangloff (ph) which was some kind 

of a famil y town cl ose to us.  In Vangloff, m y grandfather had four brothers and t wo 

sisters.  No, three brothers, four boys and two sisters.  One of the brothers immi grated to 

Argentina before the war, and three other brot hers stayed, and then t wo sisters sta yed in 

Poland.  And the y all died in the Holocaust.  The most educated was Mendel who was, I 

think, the l awyer.  He stayed in Vangloff and was actually quite respectful citizen of the 
city.  He was in the cit y council and his daughter who survived and was in Argentina now 
told me that he was as respected __+  birthda y, the ma yor of the city came to have the 

dinner with hi m.  And they all have been hiding in the  in their house, which was on the 

mai n square in the attic.  It was  I don't  know how many people exactl y, probably 12 or 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
6 
15 or 16 people hi ding there.  After  when t he liquidation of the lock out Jewish 
community.  And they've been shot on the main square mainly.  And he decided t hat he 

doesn't want to hide anymore and he  he went down and he like, you know, in som
e way 
faced the squads and was talking apparently.  The legend said was tal king to the people, 
to the Jewi sh people that we have to do something.  We have to try it , to die with dignity, 
this kind of thing.  The rest of the family remai ned for a few days more in the attic.  And 

then the younger boys, the younger decided that they have to try to save two girls, the 

youngest girls, the daughter of Mendel and another cousin.  And the y've been blond and 

blue e yed so the y decide the y have the chance probably to survive.  And they gave them 

the address of this engi neer, and then told t hem t o  go to a train station and try to go 

to Warsaw.  The girls didn't want to leave the fami ly.  The y've been crying and the y've 
been  they didn't want i t.  And so one of the brother of little Curst is(ph), this woman who 
is now in Argentina kicked them out, kicked them out from the stairs.  And when little 

__+ many years later told me the story, she was still angry with her brother that he did it.  

So the y've been walking through Vangloof.  And I think everybody knew them i n the 

city.  And they've been cryi ng.  And no one saw them, so it was some kind of, you know, 

miracle.  They came to the station.  They took the train.  The y found t he engineer.  And 

the engineer  and my aunt from Warsaw ghett o probably she was already there.  And she 
provided the fake papers for my aunt and for older of those two girls, and the younger 

girls been adopted by his fiancee.  

Q:  The engineer's fianc√©?   

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
7 
A:  Yes.  Risha (ph) was her name.  It means fiance's name.  My aunt who looked quite 
Jewish, she was wearing some kind of you know    

Q:  Your father's sister?  

A:  Yes, m y father's sister, Marilka (ph).   
Q:  Marilka.  She decided and under the advice of this engineer al so, another cousin 
decided also to enroll as a volunteer to German, to the first labor.  And I think it  was 

choice of several Jewish people there because they knew t hat the German don't recognize 

the Jews and __+ claim the Jews, so the y felt much safer in Germany than Poland.   

Q:  Can I ask?  Can I interrupt on t his? You heard this story only after your father's 

death?  

A:  Yes.  
Q:  So unt il that t i me, all of this was incognito.  It was completely unknown?  
A:  Yes, I didn't know t hose stories before.  

Q:  Were you   

A:  I knew that m y grandparents died, and I knew that m y father had another sister who 

died in the ghetto, but I didn't know t he details.  And I di dn't know t he names.  

Q:  When did your interest become  when did your interest become pi qued?  Were you 

alwa ys interested or was it you only became interested later?  
A:  Well, I don't remember how it was.  I remember perfectly well the moment when I 
learned about the ori gin of my father and his __+ as well.  And I was six.  I was pla ying 

with the children in the courtyard and some child was like screami ng at me that I'm a 

Jew.  I didn't know exactl y what t he Jew is.  So I came back to the apart ment.  And I 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland

asked my mother what did that mean?  And she said that yeah, that 's t rue.  My father is 
Jew.  And my grandfather died in the Warsaw ghetto, that I don't have to be ashamed of 

being Jewi sh, that it's a part of the great history, the great nation, and that I never have to 

hide.  It means she gave me some kind of, you know, courage to face it, which was 
actually qui te rare because most of m y parents' friends, Jewish friends, they didn't talk 
about it wi th the children, and mostly have been hiding, you know, this reality from the 

children.  They've been mostly involved i n some kind of the activities with the  connected 

with the regime.  And they wanted probably  t hey didn't want  to put t he burden on the 

children.  Also the y didn't  the y didn't consider probably themselves as Jews anymore.  It 

was very complex and complicated situation, and many of them had their names changed.  

Q:  But your father didn't?  
A:  No, m y father didn't.  So I didn't  I didn't feel that he's hiding som ething.  I just  he 
probably di dn't feel like to talk about it.  And the y didn't ask him.  I had quite 

complicated relationshi p with my father.  He didn't talk to other children too much.  He 

started only when my parents divorced.  After, he started t o be very active father, before 

he was pretty much absent father.  

Q:  That was one of my questions is what  was your father like and what kind of 

relationship yo
u had wi th him?  
A:  He was very  you know he was very intelligent, very  very extrovert in some wa y, 
man partying a lot, telli ng a lot of stories.  Having a lot of friends and  but in the same 

time it was something, I think, fragile human, you know. He was intellectual, very bright.  

And on the beginning he was very much invol ved in the Marxist ideology, and slowly but 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
9 
surely he became quiet, you know, disillusioned by the regi me and by the wa y it's goi ng 
on.  Not in Soviet  Union, although it's interest i ng.  In Soviet Union, I think he had such a 

goodness among t he ordinary people that he's a member of the Soviet Union, have been 

quite posit ive, but after when he became better connected and better educated.

Beginning File Two 
Q:  When we talk about these films, when we talk about t he stories that you are tryi ng to 

tell, that there are com plexities.  There are many la yers to them.  How do you think 

people in the east  I'm being very stereotypical here, how do you think people in the east 

look at the world, the t erm of complexities and deal with that, your audiences in the east 

or your public, and how do the y do in the west, and do you think that there's something 
there?  So that's one.  The other is we have our character from In Darkness who i s  
who is 
an anti hero as we've been talking as __ sa ys.  And at some point he becomes a rescuer, 

and what compels him to do that?  What do you think compels hi m to do that, and I'll  

stop with those t wo, and we'll see what happens in ten minutes.  Okay?  

A:  You know when    we can talk, yeah?  

Q:  Yes.  

A:  When somebody asks me what  is the most important i n m y movies or what I want to 
tell in this movie, I mostly answer that I want to tell the life is compli cated.  And the 
complexities for me like, you know, the only t ool I have, you know, t o face the subject of 

the work.  And in the same time, yes, you are asking  you have been asking me how the 

audience reacts.  It 's changing.  I t hink that, you know, for example, Polish audience in 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
10 
the ti mes of the communists, the y have been accepting complexity very easily, and not 
only accepting the reali ties as presented as complex, but  also the language is complex, 

that the styl e is complex, that they are using metaphors and symbols and so on.  So it was 

very you know __ and very curious audience, and the y wanted to understand something 
about themselves.  Now, it's a little different, you know, actually after the communists 
fell apart, it became m uch more consumer kind of a society.  A li ttle same situation 

happened in  the west.  What I remember comi ng first with my movies to France or to the 

United States, I thought that the audience, whi ch is interested in t his kind of a story much 

wider.  Now you really have the last Mohicans in some ways, the distributors who have 

been doing it.  But it can change again, you know, I think it can change with the state of 

the society, you know?  And you know you have the moments when t he people want to 
be cradled, t he y want t o be, you know, put to sleep in some wa y.  They want to be 
en
tertained.  
Q:  That 's right.  

A:  Like chi ldren that are little, tell me another, tell me another.  I'm bored.  I'm bored, 

I'm bored. And actually, you know, the situation changes because t he world suddenly 

becomes very dangerous place.  And you have to deal with that.  And you are looking for 

some kind of the __+ fears and to your, you know, frustrations.  So I don't think that  it 
will be now forever.  It  will be alwa ys more stupid, I think, will be actually at some point 
ma ybe wiser than now.  And so it was for me fascinating hero. And not only because he's 

going through the change because, you know, change in some wa ys it 's stereotyping, you 

know, the hero is mostl y going through the change.  

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
11 
Q:  Yes.  
A:  Especially in America storytell ing, right.   

Q:  Has to change, has to change.   

A:  And what I wil l like that you cannot really sa y why and in which point this change 
appears.  It 's __+ change.  He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's 
not intellectual, he doesn't have  he's very si mple man.  And, you know, a lot of reason 

why he deci des in t his very moment to do what he's doing.  But it can change the minute 

later, so he's like somebody who is  who is walking on the rope, t he wire, and he can sli p 

in any moment of the side of the good or bad.  And in some point, in some point  I think 

he feels  and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be 

successful, he does something well.  So he feels sometimes the weight of the 
responsibility.  And I think that responsibility has left.  That in some way the moment 
when you are responsi ble for somebody, it's something which is  which created this 

strong attachment.  And for him i t becomes a kind of obsession.  In some wa ys he is 

obsessed by that, l ike t he gambler, you know, at some poi nt he's acting in irrational wa y.  

It doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his int erest.  It's against the 

safet y of hi mself and hi s family, and also it's against his world of values because no 

mat ter for hi m the Jews, no matter __+ and not  __* paid for it, what the __* you know, it 
means it's interesting t o watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know?  
And I think that it makes this character in some wa y very real and very symbolic in the 

same
 ti me l ike, you know, like this kind of the confusion.  I think most of the people are 
going  not only during the wartime, but especiall y in those dangerous circumstances 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
12 
through the process of the confusion.  And at sometimes who deci de t o do something just 
by chance, something good, the m ystery of the good, you know, how the people are 

doing acting altruistic.  It's quite easy t o understand why the y're acting in a terrible wa y, 

why the y are cruel, why they are murderers, but why the y are good, you know, I don't 
know.  It is a m ystery so, you know, expl ore t his mystery with a character, which is not 
angelic at all.  It's interesting.  And also the ___+ the people are all st ereotypes.  He's 

watching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through hi s 

language, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know?  They don't watch him as 

a human being, you know, so they are bot h in some wa y mirroring thi s kind of the judges.  

And it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks.  And when it 

breaks down, suddenly the y are naked, you know, the y are standi ng naked Jews standing 
like, you know, next to the naked __ and they are like looking int o the mirror, you know, 
I thought t hat, you know that it 's actually very touching without being, you know, 

emotionally judgmental or something.  

Q:  Wow.  Another word pops into my head and that's victi m and how do you define a 

victi m?  How do you  how do victims define themselves?  And when t hey have 

competitions as to who is the greater victi m, and who owes whom?  And the y are often 

tied in wit h stereotypes.  It also get s expressed in times of extreme  what's the word I'm 
searching for?  When life is so extreme, where you ma y l ose life, when you really are a 
victi m, you know, the associate, the one who says I'm not going to take part in thi s 

anymore is  ends up being an innocent vict i m.  

A:  Right.  

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
13 
Q:  You know I don't know what question I wanted to ask with that.  But then it  comes up 
from what you were saying.  Is there anyt hing that you would li ke our audience, our 

researchers t o know and to understand about what moti vates your work?  What motivates 

you to look at these particular stories for this kernel, that you sa y this I can talk about, 
and this is a story I can tell?  
A:  I don't want  to be __+ like patterns and I don't want to be pretenti ous, and I don't  want 

to speak about building bridges or something like that because then I don't believe real ly 

that the cinema or any movie can change the world, but I really believe that even if it 

opens e yes to some, I don't know, to some real it y that is not obvi ous i t's already good.  

And I try t o make my movie as communi cati ve as possi ble and as complex as possible.  

Telling complex st ories in a simpl e wa y in some way.  And probably I have this  I have 
this  I have this urge to do it this wa y because I have some kind of pat hological  
pathological, you know, ambitions without bei ng preachy.  Because I receive some, you 

know, things like that from the movies, from t he books, from the  you know from the art  

and from the storyt elling.  And I felt like it  changed me, shaped me, you know?   

Q:  It also sounds like from your nanny and from your parents is that the y weren't 

preachy.  

A:  Right.  
Q:  The y shared what was real for them.  
A:  Right.  So, for example, in Darkness, premiered ten da ys ago in Poland.  And it was 

first country, I didn't have the high hopes.  I thought that if we succeed to create some 

kind of you know, excitement, Polish stars and then, you know, it would have good 

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
14 
critics in American press already, i t will have ma ybe 100,000 of the viewers, which is 
oka y, you know, but suddenly it became huge success, and no one could understand wa y.  

Suddenly i t's the top box office movie for the second week.  And with the young 

audience, you know, the multiplex audience. And it's better t han Sherlock Hol mes.  It 's 
better than Spielberg's movie.  And it's better even than the Cat and Boots, and not only 
the theaters are fooled, but the people are extremely like receptive, you know, several 

people wrote to me and the people I don't know, and told the story about the y tri ed three 

times to go through the theater and found out when they went, and that the y seen the 

viewers who have bee buying, you know, popcorn at the beginning  before the show and 

who have been coming out from t he theater wi th a cup full of popcorn.  They didn't t ouch 

it even.  So, you know, I told myself, what it is, you know, it is myst erious, you know, 
when you can really touch the people, as I sa y touch some kind of audience  __ 
very 
young audience and not only Jewi sh audi ence but German Jewish audience as well.  I 

didn't expect it, but here it's even much more of a m ystery because __+ had a lot  of 

entertainment.  It was l ight in some wa y, you know, very heavy subj ect and it was k
ind of 

light story like __ tale.  And this one is really, you know, it's really harsh, it means it's 

really  it is real experience of going through the very, you know, very difficult thing.  

And still like people are open to it  and in Poland, you know.   
Q:  Well, congratulations, it's wonderful news. 
A:  Yeah, it  makes me very happy and a lit tle shocked.  I still don't know what t o do wi th 

that.   

Interview with Agnieszka Holland  
15 
Q:  Well, I have on  that was going to be my last question, but I have sort of another last 
question, but it sounds to me that one has t o be not afraid to be lonely, t o have a double 

identity, to look for these controversies.  And I wondered whether or not you've 

experienced that and, yeah, when you have, yeah. 
A:  I think I like the situation.  I accept the sit uation.  And I try to make m y best, you 
know, out of the situation.  Tired of being lonel y.  I'm never exactly thinking the same 

thing, you know, as the mainstream of this or t his, you know, si de.  It 's interesting, you 

know, because on the occasion of this last movie in Poland I did a lot of promoti on.  And 

I was in a lot of TV shows and a l ot, mostly t alking about this, you know, complex and 

complicated issue of Polish Jewi sh relati onshi p and the Polish guilt and the facts which 

appeared not so long ti me ago like ten years ago about like partici pat ion in    
Q:  __+   
WOMAN:   __+ for example and, you know, I can talk about it to any Polish person, you 

know, and without , of course, someti mes when you have the real fascists in front of you, 

you are losi ng the kind of cold blood, but I try to come to this extreme.  I try to be as 

open and as receptive of his, you know, fears and his, you know, prejudice and his 

frustration as possible.  And in some wa y it works, you know, at least it works for the 

other people who are watching it.  And, you know, it's  I don't know.  I never  I never  I 
never hide it, you know, m y Jewish side, which makes m y enemi es a little speechless 
because the y've been writing terrible things about me in t hose Internets, you know, 

Internet sites, in Poland I mean.  But at the same time what can the y tell?  You know, I'm 

just--
