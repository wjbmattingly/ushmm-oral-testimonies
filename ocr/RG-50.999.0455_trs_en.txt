W hen you were born
 
in Poland, yourf am ily m oved to Brussels.

Because ofm y age

ecause of m y age.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e, Fanny, that youhada wonderful childhood.
 
>> F a
nny Aizenberg:  Extrem ely.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Belgium is a small country.  It's just the size of  New Jersey.  But one 
wonderful thing inBelgium  which hadn'thappened in any country inEurope is that the convent, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

the 
nuns, ha
d 
helped Jewish people.  And don'tf orget,food was rationed.  And in Belgiumthey 
hadbig signs on different countries.  If we f ind a Jewish person that you're helping and you're 
hiding, we would kill you and thepeople whohave been hiding.
 
 
B u t 
just to give you anidea, becauseof  theirdedicationand their caring, if  you ever 
go here to the 
5t h
 
f loor, there's adocum entation of thosepeople who cam ehereand they 
have been askedto tell what m ade them  to do such a wonderful thing.  And don'tfor
ge t, 
because of their caring, because of their dedication, Belgium  istheonly country where they 
saved 4,000 Jewish children includingm y own child
 h
ere today.  Sojust to give you an idea 
that it doesn'tmatter what youare.  If you care tohelp
 
--
 
and the docum entationthey have 
here, those people have been interviewed. W hatm ade youdo that? And you know
, t
h e 
sim plestthing they said, "
I
sn't that the norm al thing todo?"  W hich is just unbelievable.
 
 
I want you todo, sinceyou're here vis
it in g 
--
 
I' m
 
volunteering here.  I'm  injured and 
I 
live in a wheel
 
chair. W hat Ihave learned here and I volunteerevery Fr iday is becauseof the 
audience. People come to seethe Museum . It's justamazing that those people
 
--
 
the only 
reason what m ade us do that, b
ecause that's thenorm al thing.
 
 
I appreciate all of you com ing because there's so muchto learn. And the purpose of  
survi vors to com e andspeakto you guys, to your people, because there's som uch that we 

ought to do to help another humanbeing. 
 
A nd  d on
'tforget becauseof  such small convents 
andnuns and otherhelpf ul people, 4,000 Jewish people, Jewish children,are alive today.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And, Fanny
,  
in a little while we're going to talk moreabout that.  Beforethe 
wa r
 
--
 
let's talk about your life a little bit before the war.  Before war broke out in Europe in

September
 
1939, by that time you had finished college, you had gone to work, you got 
m arried,and you had your daughter
,  
Josiane. During that tim e, though, while that was 
happening for y
ou, Hitler came to power, Kristallnacht happened. Tell us in those early adult 
years, bef ore the war actually began, what effect
 
did what was happening have on your life?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  A tremendous effectbecause Belgium and Hollandare very sm all 
countries.  Belgium  and Holland, they were prom ised they would rem aina
 
f ree country like 
Swit zerland or Spain.  But,of  course,as youknow by today, that has not happened that way.
 
T he Nazis who hadbeen sabotaging, the Nazis were in Belgium  in1939, which we didn'tknow 
that.  And,of  course, at the museum , shows how it has been done.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell me a little bitabout yourhusband, Jacques. T ell us abouthim .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell,m y late husband, he was a 
vio lin  
player.  He andf ive other people 
were m aking a living playing in m ovie housesuntil 1938.  It'shard f or you people to imagine 

how the changes have beenm ade inBelgium.  But thenagain, not too long ago they had a 
m ovie called"T he Artist" and
 
in them ovies had the sam eproblem becauseonce they cam e in, 
theartists in theperform ance lost their job like many others. T henhe went to night school and 

becam e a 
ta i
l o r.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  So he becam ea
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  He becam e a 
tai
lor after he couldno longer become am usic
ia n
. 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou first gotm arried, you were working, too. You had a prom inent job 
in the Royal House
.

>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Another thing, Belgium hasf ree education.  Ifyou go thef irst six grades 
and you're ok,
 
you could continue
a
f ter university.  T his is what happened in Belgium . AndI 
don'tthinkI would have beenableto getthehigher education I got. I graduatedBA in 
A
rt and 
D
esign.  And becauseof  that,afew of the other people who graduate atthat ti
me
 
--
 
a nd  don ' t  
forget, education isf ree of charge. As long as you m ake thef irst grades. T hen you can 

continue.
  
And afew of us who graduated, touniversity, we got the job working f or the 
Royal 
House
. You see, Belgium  still has royalty and power in 
B e lgiu m
a
lthough it's a Catholic 
country.  But they still havef reeeducation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  March 21, 1939,75 years ago
, 
if  you don'tm indm e saying, you had your 
daughter
, 
Josiane.  At that tim e, knowing that
 
--
 
what was goin g on in Germ any, although
 
the 
war hadn't officially begun, Hitler was clearly
 
--
 
had clearly established hispower long before 
that. W hen you had Josiane, were you andJacquesf earf ul about thefutureat that time?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Not atall. W e were not.  And this has been
 
our problem because we did 
believe the government when they say Belgiu m  and Holland would rem ainf ree.  Webelieved 
thatthis is going tobe true, but, of  course, itwasn't.  And we were i nnocent becauseaf ter 
Kristallnacht
 
--
 
I don't know if  you heardabout it.  You'll learna lot about Kristallnacht.  
Kristallnachthappened in 1938 in Germ any and inAustria. T hrough Hitler's orders, people 

were killin g Jews, arresting Jews.  T hat's why it's called Kristallnacht
 b
ecause they were 
breaking windows, harassing Jews, just because of being Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Night of  BrokenGlass.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.  And because of that,a Jewish organization in Germ any and in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Austria were saving 2,000 Jewish children, cam e toBelgium and every f amily, Jews or 
n
on
-
Jews, were hiding all of those Jewish children.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had one in your hom e.  Right?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Ever ybody
, e
ven Jewis h, non
-
Jewish people
f
elt the sym pathy because 
Belgium , thoughBelgium  isa Catholic country, we hadnotbeen raised of hate like has 

happened in many other countries.  AndI guess this is why the churches and thepriests and 
thenuns had been willi ngly opening their churches. And I repeat m yself. T hanks to their 
wi llingness and their courage
 
--
 
don't f orget, 
food was rationed.  It was quite an 
accomplishment
, 4
,000 Jewish children alive today including m y own child. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fanny, Germany invadedPolandto startW orldW ar II and then Germ any 
invaded Belgium  in May
 
1940. Tell us what happened to you and yourf am ily once the 
G e r m an s  c am e i n t o B elgi u m .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell,f irst of all,as soon as Poland was invaded by the Germ ans the 
governm ent inBelgium had asked young men to sign if  they would be will ing to help Belgium .  
On thatparticular tim e, although we were ver y young, we all had doubts what's going to 
happen in Belgium  although Belgium was notoccupied at that tim e yet. Butthe Jewish 
organization in Germ any and inAustria,theyhadorganized the Kindertransport.  Youngsters 
to the ageof 10,theywere saved, and theyall arrived in Englandand they survi ved today.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of England, onceGerm any invaded Poland
 
--
 
excuse me, Belgium , 
there was a call to join the Royal Air Forcef rom  England.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell, people had joined England's Arm y.  Anybody.  T hey had been 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
askedto sign up. In case there wouldbedanger, they would needtheir help.  Thousandsof  
people had signed up.
 
 
Also, Belgium  was anopen country until theGerm ans invaded it. And everybody 
wa s
 
allo wed to come because many peoplethoughtthey had been lucky to behidden in 
Belgium  and survi ve
.  S
o because of thatm any, m any peoplehad signed up. T hey didn't 
know f or what.T hey didn't know what was going to be done.  Andthis is why in England 
they 
hadthe vision f rom all different countries who had beenabletoescape to England.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your husband Jacques, he answered the call.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Oh, yeah
, a
nd m any, m any, m any other people.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what happened.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  In Dunkirk
 
--
 
I  do
n't know if  you're fam iliar;
 
the border of  going to 
England. All of thosepeople who signedup, when the Germ ansoccupied, they had to sign up 

andthey met in Dunkirk, which is just the border.  In Dunkirk therewere
 
ships waiting f or the 
people to be evacuated, arranged by British. Butthe sadthing is that the undergroundf rom  

Germ any, or the Nazis
 
--
 
all the Nazis had bom bed those ships.  Only one shiparrived in 
England including m yhusband. 
 
 
But you see, we didn'tknow anything what goes on in the world.  Becauseas soon 
as the Germ ans occupied Belgium,f irst thing they did, they had talks in the neighborhood 

announcing that we have to f ollow orders otherwise we're going to be punished.
 
Because of that,they had
 
conf iscatedour radio.  It's sodiff icultfor young people today to 
understand how im portanta radio was in our lives becausethat was theonly wa y we couldget 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
thenews f rom  the world.  I say for young people today, diff icultbecause there's so much 
t e ch
nology that we don't need a radio. Butthat's how.
  
 
 
And that was thef irst thing, thef irst punishment we had. Becauseof  that,they were 
able to arrest people wherever they were. W e were supposed tobe told that we're going to 
work in Germ any, butwe
 
never knew if  we were going to work or what thepurpose was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now you're alone with Josianebecause youdon't know if your husband is 

alive or dead.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Nobody knew because we were notallowed to buy anewspaperand not
 
having thef acility of  the radio which was ouronly wa y of  getting thenews on the restof  the 
world. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So, Fanny, once Jacques was gone, whatdid you do to support Josiane and 

to  try 
to avoid m ore problem s f or yourself
? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell,m ost young people, m y age at that tim e, we all had the 

underground.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You joined theunderground.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T he underground. And Belgium, so interesting, thepeople to realize it is 
theonly country that people
 
--
 
we have to sign ournam eand ouraddress. T his way it wou ld 
be easy to know where we are and to get that.  And that's how the word underground solidarity 

started.  People had been in Belgiumf rom  Germ any andf rom Austria, and that'show us young 
people we were
 
at that tim e. W ehave got toknow thosepeople,too. 
 
 
And we had an attic atthat tim e.  Andthat's wherem any people wer e hiding.

>> Bill Benson:  In your attic?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.  They were hidden in theattic. W edidn't even know the
i r n ame .
  
And we shouldn't know becausethe mainfear was if  we would be arrested and beaten,that 
we would gi ve out thenames of all of thosepeople
, w
hich we didn't.
  
 
 
And this is why when the war ended in Belgium  in1944
,  
m y daughter andanother 
youngster got a decoration because what we haddone during the war.  And the reasonf orthe 
decoration isbecause I was helping.
  
You see, in Belgium ,also, is the only country where 
Jews and non
-
Jews were together inthe sam eunderground.  People were diff erent and 
hel
ping other people. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And while you were workin g i n the underground and the resistance, the 

deportations of Jews by the Nazis began in Belgium  in 1942.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  And very strongl y.  Very strongl y in their homes andmany other plac
e s. 
>> Bill Benson:  And that led you in 1942 when Josiane was 3 yearsold, to make
 
--
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  She was 3.
 
>> Bill Benson: T om ake that extraordinary decision.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  I tell you,f orm any days and many nights I could not decide w
hat to do 
or what nottodo. I think this was the biggest decision I have m ade in m y young age, which I 
don't know how this was possible. I really didn't have a choice
 b
ecause it was either hiding m y 
c h ild
 
--
 
becauseas a young person I was sure we were going to bearrestedand sent to work.  
W estill didn't know wh at work m eans to theGerm ans and what work m eans to the restof the 
population.

>> Bill Benson: W henyou were able toput Josiane in hiding
 
--
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell, also, through thepeople we knew f rom  the underground, two 
ladies cam e totake m y child into hiding. I don't have totell you. Anybody who has a child 
couldunderstand the irony how you separatewith your child and that's all I had.  How you 
m ake that decision. 
 
 
And another
 
thing. W e were not allowed to know where they were going to be 
hidden. Thepeople were smart enoughto know if  we're going to be arrested, we're going to 
be beatenand tell them  where it was so we were not allowed to know
 w
here m y blessedchild 
would be
 
hidden.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And once Josiane went intohid
in g
 
and you didn't know where she was, by 
thattim e yourf ather had been taken.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.  You see, in Belgium , Jews were not allowed to be buried
 l
e ga lly.   
So they hada groupof people including the rabbi. And that's whatnighttime they made 

arrangem ent. And inhiding and in secret those Jewish people whodied that period of time 
hadbeen helping andburying legall y, norm ally, how our people should be taken care and 
buried at that p
articular tim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now it's you and yourm other.  Youhave to go into hiding.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  My m other was in hiding in a place called an old age home. Butat that 
tim e in Belgium they only had oldage homes for non
-
Jewish people. 
 
T hat's where m y m other 
was hiding f orm any ye ars.  But thenonce m y latem otherand I got together,and we hadbeen 

arrested, and we were taken toa place calledMalines, which was a cam p.  Once they had a

certain numberof  people, though we had towork there we were deported.
 
 
W e were takenaf ter10 days, taken intoa cattle train which you're going to see once 
you go on the tour. In that particular cattletrain, they had111people.  After two day
s 
and 
threenights when people were open
 
--
 
the  cattle  tr
ain was open, 40people cam e out alive.  
Just to give you an idea of the conditionsonthe cattle train.
 
 
Andonce you see the train, it gives you an idea how bad and how im possible or 
d if f icu lt  it  wa s
 b
ecause people couldn't evenbreathe.  Can you im agine?  111 people in one 
ca ttle  tra in . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, you didn't know you were going to this place called Auschwitz, but 
now you f ound yourselfthere.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W edidn'teven know thatnam e.W e never learned that nameuntilwe

ere.  Because Ialso know that the majority of  young people who were in the undergr ound 
would have killed themselves if they would have known what ourdestination would be. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So once you were there,tellus what happened when you got to Aus
ch witz. 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell, Auschwitz was a place that there's no words todescribe.  Although 

it hasbeen so many years, such ahorrible thing has been com m itted to Jewish people. And 
now I have learned when I volunteerhereonFriday that all the witnesses deportedand 
arrested.
 
 
As am atter off act, ina couple of weeks, they're goin g to have a whole group of  
Jehovah'sW itnesses,and they want to speak upand let the worldknow what has been 
happening.

>> Bill Benson: W henyou got to Auschwitz, you were sparedf rom  dying.  You were selected 
to do slave labor.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W hich, of  course, we didn't know. W e were put in line
:  o
ne line for 
wom en
, o
ne linefor men.  My m other went in another line, andI went into another line.  So 
when
 
the off icer
 
--
 
another thing Ididn't tell you. W hen thedoorf rom thetrain opened, we 
were greeted by Nazi s oldiers with barking dogs.  Just to give you an ideahow that welcome 
has been.  And we were told that we have to leave everything on the train.
 
T here's no words 
yet invented
 t
he horrors which have been com m itted on people. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwere youf orced todowhen you were there?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell, once we got to Auschwitz and off  the cattle trainand we would line 

up,one side women,one side men.  Andm y m other went to another line
 a
nd  t
henI was hit 
over the head. " If  I tell you to stay here, youdon't gothere."  Ifelt to be with m y m other, we 

both could survive because we didn't know that this could be a surviving place. 
 
 A  
group of ushad been taken to a prisondoor. W ehad to undresscom pletely.  
Don't f orget
, w
e were young wom en and come f rom decent homes. W ehad never undressed 
inf rontof  strangers.  But we were so overcom e withf ear that we still did not believe that
 
we  
were in such ahell.
  
 
 
In that room once we were undressed, our head was shavedand we were gi ven a 
unif orm , a striped uniform , and wooden shoes and ourhair was shaved. And alsof rom there 

we were takento the shower, andf rom therewe were takento
 
the barracks.  A barrack 
consisted of shelves.  Andon the shelves there was room for six people. And there weresix 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

shelves on each side. And the shelves were covered with straw.  I cannot express any wor ds 
how scared. W edidn't know what's the next
 -- 
is co m in g of  u s.
 
 
So after the shower we  went to our barracks. You see, we becam e likef am ily with 
thef ive other people in hope by just supporting one anotherm aybe the lif e wouldnotbeas 
devastating. 
  
 
 
So the next m orning we were again put in line. W e were put in lineaf ew times 
during theday.  And that was for selections.W edidn't know what the selectionmeans.  A 
selection meant that the crematorium  were there. T hey hadbeen so organized with thehelp of 
so many other countries that they hada crematorium . T hey were putting a hundred peoplein.  
And inf our m inutes af ter, thef our people were
 
--
 
the100 were dead.  T here was another line, 
another 100. T hat was going onf or24hoursa day.
 
 
Our group was chosen to work at the amm unitionfactory.  And thefum es were ver y 
badbecauseof  the chem icalsused to clean those little bombs.  And we were told thatthose 

little bom bsare being cleaned. Another group, they was putting powder which was the 
explosive to kill people.  But we didn't know that.W e all got sickf rom  that.  
 
 
Andonce you got sickin Auschwitz, we were told afterwards
 
--
 
another thing they 
did, we were not people anym ore. W ehad anumber tattooed on our arm . That was like cattle 
today in farm s.  Cattle have num bers.  T hat's
 
what we had. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you don'tm indm easking you this.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Not atall.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were tattooed, as you just said. You were tattooedtwice.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
17
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T he reasonI was tattooedtwice, because three days later they realized 
thattwo people had the sam enum ber.  So 
t he f ou r  of  
us who had the sam enum ber wentback 
and we aretattooed twice.  And that's why I have two num bers.  You'll see me afterwards.
 
 
So we went to work in the amm unitionfactory.  And that's where Eichm ann came to 
visit us because they felt we didn'tm ake enough of our quota, although we were working 

above the human capacity if that's possible.
  
T henagain, it wasf ive m ilesf rom  thebarracks to 
the work andf rom  thework to the barracks back.  And com ing back we were supposed toget 

tea, which was thetaste of plain water. And in the morning to startwork, we were workin g 20 
hours a day, and theyfelt it's not the capacity of  ahum an being.  Many, many people just died 
bending over and cleaning with the chem icals.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile you were there atAuschwit z, I believe one of the crematorium s was 

blown up.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Right.  One crematorium  was blown up. It was on television not too long 

ago.  Five wom en were able to steal the littlebombs with the powder.  They hid itunder. They 
were able toblow up one crematorium .  Oneperson, one wom an, was able to escapebecause 
theothers were caught and they were hanged inf ront of everybody i n cam p.  Notonly 
because they were hanged in f rontof  everybody because we all have to stay in line until they 
all died. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fanny, I know this is just sohard to talkabout just in general,but you wer e 

also, on topof  everything you described, youwere selectedfor medical exper
im entation.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T hat's thehardest thing to beable totalk. W e stayed in linefor any

reason, no matter how cold or how f reezing the weather was.  And in Poland at that tim e the 
weather was ver y, ver y cold at the tim e we were there.
  
W e 
were in line. W e were checkedif  
we have lice.  Many tim eson that time of standing in line, which happened very often, aoff ice

by the name

isn 't th at 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  [Inaudible]
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T here was one off icer. His name wasf am ous.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Mang
e le
? 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  I'm  sorry.  They never found him  alive.  His biggest dedicationf or Hitler 
was to takepeopleout of  line regardless they pick wom en, young wom en,also pickbabies, 
andalso picked twins to makediff erent kindsof  experim entation.  And Ialso was taken once, 
like m any other youngwom en, andm ainly babies.  
 
 
It's unbelievable what educated professors with their own hands were ableto kill 
babies.  Althoughthey were educatedprof essors and church goers, they di
d  tha t. A nd  I,too , 
went through theexperim entation. Becauseof that, with m any years of  having medical care, I 

have never beenable to havem ore children. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You wouldendure Auschwitz, and som ehow you we re ableto survi ve until 

January
 
1945
, a
s theSoviets, as the Russians got close.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T hat's because Auschwit z was evacuated becausethe Russians was 

com ing, very, ver y close.
 
 
I d on 't k
now if  you ever heard the word DeathMarch. T he reason why it was called 
a Death March isbecause it wasf reezing snow and we were m arching to different cam ps for 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

about threem onths.  
 
 
I have af riend who works here who has studied them aps andm ade m aps.  Next 
tim e if I ever com eback
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You'll com e back.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  I don't know if I'm going tom ake it. Butanywa y, thank you. 
 
So he hasm ade themaps.  
 
 
W ehad beenm arching f or threem onths withoutfood and withoutanything.
  
T he  
reason why it was call ed a Death March,because it was ver y heavy winter, 17thof
 
January.  
T hat's why they have a specialprogram  herefor that particular date. So the whole world could 
celebrate orm em orize all of  those people wedon'thave here today.W e're never going tofind 
out how m any.
  
Andthe reasonfor that, thatm any peop
le
 
--
 
whenever you saw on the snow, 
drops of blood, you knew that there was a hum an being underneath. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  You were taken to a place called Ravensbruck.W hat kind of place was that?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  It was a camp. Again,for wom en only. 
 
And, again, we have learned 
thatthey, too, went through them edical experim entations. T hey had lived through the Death 
March, through the end of the war.  Andthey had suedf ive German physicians and two were 
arrested, believe it or not.
 
 
W hen yo u  go  he
re
 
--
 
is n ' t  it  on
 
--
 
where you see the Nurem berg T
r i al .   A n d t he  s ad  
thing is, of all of those famous,educated professors, were able to com mit such unhum an 
experim entation on hum an beings.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som ehow you were able to survi ve.

20
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yeah.  It's abig question because none of us have beenabletof ind an 
answer wh y one survi ved andone didnot.  But we came at the endof  the war, and we wer e at 
the border
 
--
 
Idon't know if  you ever see them ap of Germany.  It was the lastbattle
 
between 
the Germans and the Russians.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's when you were liberated? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W e were not liberated. W e just gave up. T he six of us were barely 

a live .
 
>> Bill Benson: T hese were the six that youhadbeen with sinceAuschw
itz.  Ri gh t?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T hat's right.  You know, we becam e likefam ily
 i
n order to just support 
m orally, whatever you call it.  But we were barely ali ve. W e couldn't even move anym ore.  
 
 
Because Idon't want to describe you what has beendone to all the people who 
survi ved Auschwitz.  T here's no words.  A wonderf ulbook called "T he Night."  Again, there's 

so many words.  T here's no words that you could describe such a pain and such an injustice 
comm itted to people. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthe Russiansfound you, how did they treat you? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T he Russiansf ound us ver y, ver y accidentally because we looked like
 
--
 
you know thoseblackbags you put your garbage in? That'show we  had beenfoundout.  

T hey were looking f orRussians. That was the lastbattle.  And, of  course, the Russiansatthat 
tim e won. And they were looking at the Russians hiding inthe woods.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Looking to
 
see if Germ ans were hiding inthe
 
woods.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T hat's correct. T hey were lookingfor Germans who were hiding.  And 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
21
 
m any were.
 
 
Andby the way, if  any Germ an hadbeenfound, there was no trial. T hey were shot 
on the spot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  But in this case they f ound you.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  In this case the six of us were ver y, very lucky that they have found us.  
T hey took us in andthey cleanedus.
  
Don'tforget, we all had Typhus which was very 
contagiousand very dangerousat thatparticular time.
 
 
Andanotherthing I want to tell you,our group
 
--
 
the Russians, thef irst people
 
who 
hadpenicillin. W e were lucky to be thef irst ones to get injectionof penicillin.  Idon't thinkI 

would be sitting here today.  And then the penicillin was di vided.  
 
 
Also, because of the Russians,the Russianswere thef irst people
 
--
 
if  you see 
the 
m aps, you're going to see the way to m archfrom  theend of the battle to Berlin. T he Russians 
were thef irst ones to arrive in Berlin.  Andthe Russians were thef irst nationality or the only 
people who were thef irst onesto sign thepeace treatm ent.
  
Andalso because they had lost 
so many of  their people.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he war
 
--
 
when the war was  over, you would eventually f ind Josiane
, w
ould 
reunite with Josiane.  And you would reunitewith Jacques, your husband.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson: T ell us how that all happened.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ell, Ihad a sister who was also working f ortheunderground. Sheand 
her husband were wor king in thebasementof a church. That was a place where the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

22
 
underground
 
--
 
f or the underground.  And
 
everything was in hiding.  You didn't know, maybe 
just the next person you were workin g with or you were with.
  
So when I
 
--
 
af t e r  ab ou t  af ew 
weeks we cam e back. They tookus backf rom  where we are.  I cam eback to Belgium  with 
another of the six people
 
only because shehad no other place to go. She wasf rom  
Czechoslovakia and there was no survivors.  So she cam e with m e. Thefour others werefrom  

France. And they wen t backto France. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you made it back to Belgium .
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Once I cam eback to Belgium , the Red Crosstookus back to where we 
were.  But Ididn't have that place where we were.  Som y sister hadher apartment, and she 
hasfoundm y child.  Can you imagine? It was like heaven if that word ever exists.  And If
ound 
m y precious child. 
 
 
By the way, and then m y husband was with another group in England. And his 
division was bom bed. He was for two years in the hospital. T hat'swh y he came back in1946 

when we were reunited.
 
 
Another thing, m y child was 5 years old.  Youhave seen apicturehere when she 
was 5. W eall stayedatm y sister's place. At night she used to sneak in and come to m ybed.  
And she tiedher night gown to m inetom akesure I wouldn't runaway anym ore. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereyou able tof ind
 
out the circum stances of where Josiane hadbeen 
hidden?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Oh, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were able to learnabout them .

>> Fanny Aizenberg:  At that tim ethe convent.  Idon't know if  any of you people have gone.  It 
still e xists.  It's 
calleda Carm elite.  It was only a convent during thewar. W hat they have now 
is delinquent people who need ahom e, who need shelter. That shows you the kind of people 
who hope to help no matter what. 
 
 
And it's so surprising the power we all have, even with little things to help another 
human being.  It m akes you feel better. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Your older sister was theone who found Josiane.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How about your other sister,Rose?
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  She was anun during the war.  She was wear ing the habit. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's how she was ableto survi ve.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes.  That's where theunderground
 
--
 
they made inf orm ation. Because 
the information were only given to ver y f ew people, like to the placewhere they hada key to 
theplace where they were hiding. And m y place is only becauseone knew thenam efor the 
otherone.  Andthey only had the keyf or theperson who was supposed to be there. That's 
how the undergroundwas able to comm unicateand work together. Andthat's why Belgiu m  
being sucha sm all country the largest number of  people had been saved throughthef our 
years of the war. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You and Jacques and Josiane would make itto theUnited States, butnotuntil 
1949.  So for f o
ur years
 
--
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  W ehad
 
--
 
num berone, we didn't have relatives in Belgium .  My husband 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

hada brother in Am erica.  That's whatm adeus com e.W e hada hard time evenhere 
because it'sa different wa y of  life.
 
 
Anddon'tf orget, we didn't kn
ow
 
E n glis h
 
at that time. But it was funand interesting. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you came to the United States, af ter the war forfour years you 
rem ained in Belgium
 t
rying to rebuild your lif e and your fam ily. W hat was lif e likefor you after 
the war? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Af ter the war,f orm e, it was ver y, ver y diff icult.  Believe it ornot, it took 
m e50 years to be able to tell what I have gone through.  AndI thinkthis has happened to 
m any people who have survi ved.  Because,m yself  included, we alwa ys f eel it was our fault 
thatall of those horrors had been comm itted to hum an beings.  Im ean, those 
experim entations is not even describable.  And the sam ething what those educatedpeople 
have been able to do to babies.
 
 
And I tell you,m y eyes have witnessed things which I would never see andnever 
wi ll go out of m y brain all my lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fanny, you mentioned that when you came to the UnitedStates, it wasn't 

easy.  You didn't know
 
En
glish, of  course.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Not only it wasn't easy, there was very, ver y few people who wanted m e 

to tell anything
, a
 
young wom an with ababy, how you survi ved.  But nobody wanted to know 
thatparticular story.  That's why I didn't speak. T hat's why it took me 50 years to just 

recognize that this was notm yf aultor to many of  them illions of people, which you're going to 
learn.

I have pamphlets here.  I hope you're going to collect it. It's them apf romevery 
country in Europe which was occupied. Andon thatm ap it tells you thenames of  thed
iff erent 
countries.  Italso tells you how m any peoplehadbeen deported of each country.  Because I 
found out very accidentally
 
--
 
and I have m ade copies.  W henever I'm  here Itry to pass itout.  
W hen you see som ething in black and white, it makes iteasier to understand how m any 

people.  
 
 
Because notm any people who have survived want to adm itthat they have been in 
Auschwitz.  Not too long ago we had a visitor here who had survi ved Vietnam.  None of them  
had legs or arm sanymore.  They cam e tothe Museum . They comef rom a very, very poor 
background. T hey wa nted to know how m any people hadbeendeported. And this we have 
never found out. A small town in Poland, 7,000 people hadbeen killed.  And 16 survi ved. All 
of  those 16 people have changed their
 
names, and they all m oved to Australia. T hey just tried 
to get outof  what they saw, what they had witnessed or what was done to them.  So that'swh y 

there'snopossibility to ever f ind out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to ask you just onem ore questionand then maybe we have tim e f
o r 
a couple of questionsfrom  our audience. W hat happened to your sisters af ter the war? 
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  T his is so am azing.  My oldest sister was in hiding during the war.  And 
m y youngest sister was in hiding through the
 
war.  And they both died of  cancer.  AndhereI 
was in Auschwitz, and all theother pain situations I went through. And I know now thatI'm  

damagedfor life.  Nothing is going to change in m y hurt, inm y pain. T hat doesn't go on. They 
both died of cancer.  And here Iam  after all of that, andnot only thefood we had gotten in

cam p, but they put som epowder, either the tea or the soup which was more water than soup, 
they putpowder.  Andnone of the wom en had their periodsanym ore.  Andthis is another 
reason why we couldn't have children after the war. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm eone time when wef irstm etthat you and Jacques had 
intended to have f ive children.
 
>> Fanny Aizenberg:  Yes, we were hoping.
