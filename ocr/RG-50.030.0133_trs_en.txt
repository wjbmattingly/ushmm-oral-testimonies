[Technical conversation] 
 
Q: Okay, we™re on camera. Would you tell me  your full name  please?  
 
A: Okay. My full name  is Johanne Eva Liebma nn. My ma iden name  was Hirsch. 
 
Q: How were you called?  
 
A: Hanne. 
 
Q: And where and when were you born?  
 
A: I was born on November 28, 1924, in Karlsruhe, We st Germany. 
 
Q: What did your parents do?  What was your father's occupation?  
 
A: My father was a photographer. He had his own 
studio. My father died in February of 1925; I 
was obviously just a few months old. And 
my mother continued the business until 1938, 
December of 1938, when all Jewish businesses had to be closed. 
 
Q: Okay. What was it like for you, until 1938, growing up in Germany?  
 
A: We ll, I would say that we ha
d a very nice family life, in spite of not having a father. My 
mother had three sisters. They were in busin
ess. They were in haute couture. And, it was 
really a very loving family. I had also my fath
er's mother, my grandmother, who was a very 
elderly lady and our family life really was a very nice one. 
 
Q: What kind of school did you go to?  
 
A: Well, I entered public school like all children 
at age six, and I think 
I hated school from the 
first day I went there. It was made ever more
 difficult, because the teacher we had was even 
then a Nazi. And I was a child that couldn't s
it still, and had my mouth open probably all the 
time. And was punished for it a great deal. Okay. It did not improve my love for school. 
 
Q: Did you have friends in school?  We re 
they Jewish friends?  Christian friends?  
 
A: I had a lot of friends in school. I think we were
 the only class, first grade class, at the time we 
were 24 children. Out of the 24, 12 were Jewis
h. Fifty percent! It was an extremely high 
percentage. I think that was the only class ever
 that had such a high percentage of Jewish

students. I went to public school until 1936 when
 Jewish children were no longer allowed to 
go to public school unless their parent or their 
fathers were in the First World War and were 
in the front lines. These were the exceptions. 
So I had to go to Jewish school in 1936, and I 
went to this school until Easter of 1940.
1
 So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of school. 
And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnacht
2
, due to the fact that we had so ma ny Jewish 
-- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the concentration camp for many weeks and 
months, school was every other day two hour
s for ma ny months until everybody had come 
back and there was a semblance of a normal school day. 
 
01:03:30 
 
Q: Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, 
‚34. How, besides school, how did life change 
for you?  
 
A: Well, I would first like to go back before 1933. We lived and had our business next to a 
newspaper. This newspaper was a left-wing news
paper. And we had daily street fights, mob 
scenes, shooting, flag burning. These are the firs
t of my memories as a child outside the 
home. It was a very violent street we lived 
on. These are really my first memories and my 
mother or some one from the household pulling 
me  back from the balcony and as soon as 
they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the balcony watching what was 
going on. These are really my first memories. On
e of my other memories is the boycott of 
April 1933 where our show windows were plaste
red with "Jew!" "Don™t go to the Jew!" 
And so on and so forth. These are really so
me  of my childhood me mories. Family life was 

great. Outside the family, it was not so good. Y
ou were insulted in the street many times. 
You were called ﬁdirty Jew,ﬂ things like that. Fo
r several years, I did have Gentile girlfr iends 
and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi
 time they could no longer associate with me, 
and I would not dare associate with them. 
 
Q: We re you taunted by your school ma tes?  
 
A: By some  of them. And like my husband, I beat 
up one. And not only did I beat her, I actually 
tore her sweater to pieces. I was not standi
ng, you know, not letting it happen to me all the 
time. 
 
Q: As the Nazi regime  went on, what else happened to you and your family?  
 
A: Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht. 
 
[01:06:00] 
 
Q: Tell me about that.

A: Kristallnacht, I went to school in the 
morning, Jewish school obviously, and some thing 
seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what. And when
 I came to school and I mentioned that I 
saw the fire engines standing in 
front of a building and in the back of this building was the 
Orthodox synagogue, I was told, "Don't you know 
what's going on? "  And I said, "No, I 
don't."  She said -- this one told me, "My father
 was arrested. His father was arrested, and it 
was just a terrible situation."  The teachers, ot
her than the female teachers, did not come in. 
They were arrested. And they sent us home, I think, after about two hours. And when I came 

home all our show windows had been smashe
d. My mother was sweeping up the street. 
Okay. To the taunts and harassment of the popul
ation or the people who were made to look 
like the population. Next to us was a store that 
dealt in oriental carpets. The show window is 
gone. Ink thrown over the carpets. It was, it was impossible. The only reason our apartment 
and business was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to 
be arrested, so our apartment and our business upstairs remained in tact. 
 
Q: What did your family do after Kristallnacht?  How did you mother ma nage?  
 
A: Well, we managed fi rst of all to take care of
 a lot of customers at the time because every Jew 
needed an identification paper. To these purpos
e, you had to have a picture. The picture had 
to show your left ear. Okay. So that every pe
rson had to be taken -- the picture had to be 
taken from this side. Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark. Another 

harassment. And so we were really very bus
y in the business until the very end, until we 
absolutely closed on the 31st of December. A
nd, since I did not go to school because there 
was no school, I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from 

concentration camps, many times their first stop was really with us because they were so 
afraid they had to get the id
entification paper, the photos and everything else. I saw many 
men with their ears frozen, their hands froze
n. My mother would run pots of soup to feed 
these people first before they would go wherev
er they needed, you know, went. It was a very 
hard, very busy time. 
 
01:08:09 
 
Q: What happened after that time?  
 
A: Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of 
my mother who also had to close their business 
moved in with us because we had a very large apartment. Obviously, we shared the 
apartment. Half was an apartment, half was bus
iness. So there were all these empty rooms, 
so my aunts moved in with us because ther
e was no more income  so you had to reduce your 
living expenses. My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because 

she was very old. She could no longer keep a 
household of her own. And so here were six 
wome n in one household. Not necessarily an 
ideal situation, but it functioned somehow. 
When the war broke out Karlsruhe was on the list 
of evacuation. In other words, most of the 
population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated. And 
so we evacuated my grandmother, of all 
places, to Mannheim. And ma ny people went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
4 
 
                        
Stuttgart, other places where they could go; my
 mother decided she was not going to leave. 
And my mother's three sisters decided they 
were not going to go anywhere. We  were going -
- just going to stay where we were. My gra
ndmother we sent to Mannheim because it was 
very hard to move her in any emergency. She 
was 90 years old, and so she was away from us 
for maybe four or five months, and then we 
took her back because there was actually no war. 
There was war, but there was no shooting. Th
ere was nothing going on. So what then was 
called "Drôle de Guerre,"
3
 and, and so we took her back hom
e. This went, of course, until 
the day we were deported on the 22nd of Octobe
r 1940. I would like to interject that in the 
spring of 1940 I was for four months in the ar
ea of Hannover, where my mother had sent me, 
there was a school -- boarding school if you wis
h. It taught agriculture and horticulture and 
all sorts of things and my mother sent me 
up there because she didn't know what to do with 
me . I was hanging around the house. There 
was nothing to do. I could not do any 
apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up ther
e for four months and, I think it was four 
months, ma ybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not 

feeling well. And so I came back. And then we, of course, were deported in October. 
 
Q: Would you describe the process of that de
portation?  How were you notified and what did 
you do?  
 
01:12:00 
 
A: My mother went out shopping early in the mo
rning, as a matter of fact, and she came home 
in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the st
reet who told me  that we would be deported. 
Said everybody would be arrested and deported." 
 She did not believe it and she went to the 
Jewish community, which was only two blocks 
away from us. And sure enough the offices 
were closed, and then it dawned on her that th
ere was something to this story. And she came 
home and she told me, "Well, I guess we better st
art packing."  And before she had finished 
the sentence, the police was there and told us th
at we are arrested. No, the first thing she did 
was, "If we really have to go I have very 
good friends and I promised them certain items 
from our household. Take them over there. Go ove
r there. Take it, take it over there. Give it 
to them."  And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really German 
underground. He was a lawyer, but he must 
have been busy in the German underground 
because he knew exactly where we were going 
to be taken. Okay. The ma n was later on the 
ma yor of Karlsruhe right after the war. 
 
Q: What's his name?  
 
A: So he was, he was very clean. Wa s Mr. 
Veit. His name  was Veit. They were very good 
friends of my mother. And so I took the items, 
and by the time I came back the police was in 
the apartment telling us to pack and, and so 
my mother started. And the policeman knew my 
mother very well. He was fr om the precinct. And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can 

get your mother-in-law to stay in a hospital 
and you cannot be moved out of your apartment

until I come  back."  Now he knew very well th
at no Jewish people were accepted at this 
particular day in the hospital. So he gave us
 two hours to pack. So I packed everything for 
my grandmother. My mother packed for me  and 
for herself and my aunts, of course, packed 
for themselves. And so six wome n were even
tually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen. 
Six helpless wome n. Right! I was 16 and my gr
andmother was 91 and a half. Totally not 
comprehending what was happening. Not that 
she was senile. It was simply, it was 
some thing that was incomprehensible. And so 
we had to sign papers stating how much the 
apartment was worth. My aunt first refused and sh
e was threatened that she would be sent to 
Dachau, and so she signed. And we had to leave 
and we were loaded on a truck and taken to 
the railroad station where everybody slowly wa
s assembled. And I believe Karlsruhe had 
some  930 or 950 Jews that were deported t
ogether. All together from Baden and the 

Palatinate and the Saar. There were some Jews 
from the Saar that were also deported with 
us, only a few. It was 6,500 people, I believe, that
 were deported to Gurs at the same time. 
The ride to Gurs was horror. It was absolute
 horror. My husband has explained to you, each 
car had a person in charge for each car and th
en some one was put in charge of the train. 
They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French.  
 
Q: Why was the train ride a horror?  
 
01:16:00 
 
A: It was a horror insofar as we had no food or ba
rely any food was given to us. I think the train 
stopped in Mulhouse. For the first time we were
 given some  sort of soup and ma ybe some  
bread. Two of the old people, my grandmother 
being one of them, lost their mi nds. Most 
probably due to hunger and the strain and stre
ss and eventually, there was a doctor on the 
train, the last doctor that I knew in Karlsruhe a
nd he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to 
give to my grandmother and I did. And it really
 meant, ﬁPut her to sleep, let her go.ﬂ She 
didn't. And at the end of the ride, when we
 came to Oloron-Sainte-Marie; because she was 
totally confused. So was the other ma n, a Mr. We il. She was taken out of the train and 

disappeared for at least a week. We did not 
know where she was. My mother offered to go, 
asked if she could go with this old woma n and 
was refused. And for at least a week or two 
we did not know where she was. We  never kne
w where she was. All of a sudden we were 
told that she was in the next block in th
e camp. She must have been in a hospital or 
some place because when she came back, she was okay. She knew us. She could not 
understand her surroundings. Obviously, who c
ould?  But she was okay. She was no longer 
confused. So you can understand that the train ri
de, aside from everything else, was horror. 
My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the 
ages were great and having two people in the same car, not in the same train, but in the same 
car going -- losing their mi nds the same way 
was a little tough. When we arrived in Oloron-
Sainte-Marie, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets. It rained. It was 
incredible. We were loaded mostly on open tr
ucks and taken to the camp. And in the camp 
when we arrived, it was evening and, of course
, total bedlam and confusion. And the adults, 
and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned 

barely.

01:19:23 
 
 And so it was on us, the young, to get some  se
mblance of -- you can't  say order -- but there 
was a barracks where they were giving out straw.
 So we ran to get straw so the people at 
least could sleep on straw. My husband was luc
ky. He had even a straw mattress or whatever 
he called it. Later on, we were given stuff to put 
the straw in to make a mattress. But the first 
few nights we had straw and not
 even enough of that because some people really did sleep 
on the bare floor. And for the very old peopl
e it was just awful. A young person can always 
shift, but very old people, it is very har
d. So it was the young people who had to function 
first and did function first. A
nd slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern. Gurs 
was a camp full of mud. It was clay. When it ra
ined, you sank into the clay up to your knees. 
The first persons we lost, or one woma n we lost
 really choked to death in the mud. She went 
at night to the latrine. She fell. She coul
d not extricate herself and she died. So our 
experiences were horrendous. It is not -- I w
ould not say Gurs was Auschwitz, but it was 
what they called ﬁthe Little Hell before th
e Big One,ﬂ me aning Auschwitz. Our food was 
mi nimal. France was short on food, it is true. 
The French felt called upon to steal much of 
the money that was allocated to feed us so instead of the little, there was even less. There 
were people in the camp who stole -- were in a 
position to steal and did of this little food. So 
it was really a very diffi cult, diffi cult survival. 
 
Q: How long were you there?  
 
A: I was in Gurs from, as I me ntioned, Oc
tober 25th, 1940 until the beginning of September 
1941. 
 
Q: Whathappened--?  
 
A: My grandmother -- excuse me -- died in Janua
ry of 1941. My mother's oldest sister died in 
February of 1941. These are the two people that are buried in Gurs. 
 
Q: You answered my question. 
 
A: Huh?  
 
Q: You answered my question. 
 
A: I answered your question. 
 
Q: What about your mother?  
 
01:22:40 
 
A: My mother remained in Gurs. Her two sist
ers were able to leave Gurs and were lucky 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
7 
 
                        
enough to make their way via Marseille, North Africa to Cuba, and later on to the United 
States in 1948. My mother was not this luc
ky. And she was deported in August of 1942 to -- 
I suppose, first Drancy, and then Auschwitz. She wa
s the very first transport, or with the first 

transport, to leave Gurs. End of July, I went
 down to Gurs from Le Chambon see my mother 
who had been very ill and the camp had given me  
permission that I could enter for a week to 
visit my sick mother and they would let me
 out again. And when I came to the camp, the 
camp was closed to all visitors. I saw my mo
ther twice across the barbed wire, an empty 
field and then, of course, wire again so it 
was a good distance of ma ybe 150 feet. I saw my 
mother twice like that. And then 
I was told that the deportations are starting. I was told this 
by the Red Cross, the Red Cross that was active there, and by the Quakers. And that  they 

made arrangements for me to be able to see my mother on the railroad station, the freight 
station at Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the train. A
nd so I went down there from Gurs. It's about 
12 kilometers, I think, 15 kilometers.  I went 
down there. I spent the night in the street 
between two houses on a little -- 
on a low wall until very early, maybe five o'clock in the 
morning at which time I was allowed to enter th
e railroad station or the freight yards really, 
and I did see my mother and that's the last time I 
saw her. And this transport, I think, left, if I 
remember it right, on August 6, 1942. I went back
 from there to Le Chambon, first seeing 
my then boyfriend, now husband at Talluyers, a
nd he told you that we discussed then if 
there's any danger -- because there was talk about roundups and arrests and deportations 
even of the people who were living outside 
the camps -- that he should come up to Le 
Chambon. I me t my husband in Gurs. 
 
Q: Let us back up indeed and let us go back into Gurs. Would you describe -- you are now still 
in Gurs, how did you meet your husband?  
 
01:26:00 
 
A: I met my husband -- Well, let's put it this way. 
I worked in the so-called office. Each block 
had, as it was called, îlot
4
, its own barrack for admi nistration purposes. And his mother was 
working in this offi ce and I worked in the offi
ce, worked in the office, I ran the errands. I 
was the messenger. I distributed mail. I did messenger service. They needed young people to 

walk through the mud. Okay. And I did that and 
this is where I got to know his mother, and 
when he came to visit his mother, I came to know my husband.  
 
Q: Did you did you get a chance -- were there any 
kinds of activities, anything going on in Gurs 
where you and he had a chance to go out and just be together?  
 
A: Go off and be together?  We ll, he could co
me pretty often because he was involved in 
making music. There was a cultural life in Gurs, 
believe it or not. In fact, a very excellent 
one. We had a lot of artists, a lot of performers in Gurs. We had some very outstanding 

people with us and since he always made musi
c and was involved in a quartet, he had a pass 
that let him -- and he worked in the offi ce in 
his block -- he had a pass which allowed him to

circulate more than other people. And so he could come to see his mother more often than 
other people would have been able to. And, ye
s, we would go in the mornings, the Swiss 
Red Cross fed us breakfast or supplementa
ry food and he would come  up the camp and 
would wait for me until I would come out of 
the block and then we would walk up there 
together and have breakfast together and walk
 back together. That was that was the dating 
camp style. 
 
Q: What were the circumstances under which you left Gurs?  
 
A: The circumstances under which I left, I left Gurs was that a social worker from the OSE
5
 
came to see my mother and explained that there was a village Le Chambon, who was 

looking to help young people to take them out of
 the camp and would she agree to let me go. 
And my mother asked me  whether I would want
 to go, and I said, "Of course."  And she 
never said, "But I will mi ss you. I don't want you 
to go," or anything like that. She let me go. 
She loved me  enough to let me  go. Because ther
e were parents who did not. You're looking 
at me. Yes. There were parents who did not let their children go. As incredible as it sounds, 
they held on. My mother let me go and togeth
er with six other young people, teenagers, we 
set off beginning of September 1941 to go to Le Chambon.  
 
01:29:30 
 
 And Le Chambon was, of course, heaven. We  we
re free. We lived in a home, primitive as it 
was, it still was a house. The food, of course, wa
s much better. In fact, in the beginning we 
couldn't eat all the bread that we got. Not that
 it was such tremendous amount of bread, but it 
was more than we could eat. And so we w
ould toast it very, very hard and make little 
packages and sent it back to camp because 
our constant worry was what was going on in 
camp. So we would make, all of us, little pack
ages and sent them. We  would also go and 
steal maybe a couple of potatoes from the farmer
s in the field and sent them because they 
had no potatoes in the camp. It was an unknown 
luxury. So, we would do that. Right. And I 
would say we were content to be where we were
, but the constant worry about the family left 
behind was always there. You saw the docum
entary by Pierre Sauvage. You saw some  
pictures of very happy looking youngsters. Ye
s, we were happy ma ybe and joking and 
fooling around at times, yes, but always underl
ying this was the situation we are in. The 
situation of the parent or the other relativ
es. It was never hurray, hurray. Nothing bothered 
us. Now we come  to 1942. 
 
Q: Excuse me  my dear before we get to 1942, would you tell about the family with whom you 
stayed?  You said you stayed in a house. 
 
A: Oh, this was a home which was under the hospi
ces of Swiss Red Cross, to be precise, 
Secours Suisse
6
. Okay. We were there  not just the 
seven of us who came out of the camp, 
but ma ny French children. There was with us
 also Elizabeth, Elizabeth Koenig, née

Kaufma nn. She was with us for some  time, before she was lucky enough to leave for 
America. I think it was February or March 
of 1942. And we were a nice group of youngsters. 
 
Q: What was your role in the house?  
 
01:32:40 
 
A: We ll, I was one of those who 
didn't go to school. Madame Trocmé
7
, to this day, cannot 
understand how it happened that I did not go to 
school. How her husband let this pass. So I 
didn't. I felt -- I did not speak French at the 
time, and I felt well, here I am, 17 years old -- 
almost 17, and they'r e going to put me in the 
second graders in order to learn the language. 
This was my concept of the time, at the time, 
and so I did not go. I had some French lessons 
by a Mademoiselle Hoefert
8
, who was a refugee herself and taught at the Collège Cévenol. I 
believe she taught Latin, if I am not mi staken. 
And I had some  French lessons from her, and 
eventually I did pick up the language. Mostly 
so because in spring of 42, I was hell-bent on 

ma king some  money. And first Pastor Trocmé
9
 talked me in -- or whoever was in charge of 
that, thought I mi ght be able to work in a photo 
store, being that I came out of this line of 
business. And then this was rejected. Maybe 
they felt I would be too exposed in an open 
store. And I took a job as a maid in a prevento
rium that was just outside of Le Chambon. We 
had there children with TB
10
 and children who were in dange
r of getting TB and I worked 
there for several months until, in fact, I went 
down to Gurs to see my mother. The object was 
to make a little money. In the bargain, I learned French.  
 
Q: While you were still back in the, in the, in the children's home . 
 
A: Yeah, with my friends. Yes. 
 
Q: With your friends. You helped the other ch
ildren. Did you help take care of them?  You had 
another special role, I understand. 
 
A: Well, I sort of helped taking care of them, 
yes. In La Guespy, yes. I did help with the 
cooking. I did errands. I felt maybe being the oldest one, I felt a little bit responsible for them 
sometimes being the spokesman for them.  
 
Q: What did that mean? 
 
A: And being the one who would say no. Okay?  
 
Q: Did you were you an intermediary with the Trocmé s?

A: No. Not at all. Not at all. Rather many tim
es with the woma n who was in charge of the 
home, who was herself a Spanish refugee. It's r
eally hard to define, especially so many years 
later what you did at that time. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me about the Trocmés. What were they like?  
 
01:35:50 
 
A: We had very little contact with the Trocmés.
 We had some contact with Madame Trocmé, 
because in the beginning she would take us on pi
cnics, to get to know us . We  did not have 
daily contact with them. Not at all. They had their hands full with other things. We were 
taken care of in the home; there was no need for 
them to be in daily contact with us. They 
mi ght have been in contact, I am sure they were, with the people who ran the homes because 
there was more than one eventually. But not with us, individually. 
 
Q: Can you describe the daily life in the home?  What did you all do?  
 
A: The daily life is that most of the youngsters 
went to school, obviously. It was a very routine 
life in a children's home if you wish. It was a ve
ry primitive set up. In winter, we had barely 
any heat because there was nothing. Food was mo
re plentiful than it was somewhere else 
maybe, but it's still not -- was not very much
 for teenagers who can eat all day long, 
incessantly. And we somehow fell into a routin
e. The winter was very hard. Again, because 
we had no heat. Wa ter had to be pumped by 
hand. The pump froze in. It meant we had no 
toilet. We  had to go out into the woods, which 
was not very pleasant, especially at night. 
Right. The boys had it easier. They opened the window. Not so lucky for the girls. But we all 
survived it. We all made the best of it. 
We were a nice group of
 youngsters who got along. 
Whether it was the French children or it was us, it didn't matter. We got along. 
 
Q: Talk a little more about that. How did you feel received by Les Chambonnais? 
 
01:38:00 
 
A: Les Chambonnais. Very We ll. Extremely well. We
 felt very much at ease or at least I did, 
feel very much at ease in the village. I eventu
ally met some other people, French people, and 
there was never a problem. I met once a farmer w
ho said to me , "Even if we had less to eat, 
we would want more of you peopl
e."  Now this was an absolute reversal of what we had 
experienced all our lives from the outside worl
d that some one would say even if we have 
less we want more of you. So does this explai
n to you the attitude of the village?  Okay? In 

1942 when the roundup started of the people outsi
de the camps when I came back we were 
hidden by the farmers. We  first had a confronta
tion with the Germans at which the Director 
of the homes, Mr. Bohny
11
 was extremely clever and dipl
omatic because we were caught, 
not in the house where we lived, but in anothe
r house where we went dur
ing the night in the 
 
11
 Auguste Bohny-Reiter
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
11 
 
hope of not being caught at the place where we 
stayed, but we were. And, of course, they 
were ready to take us along and Mr. Bohny explained to them that we were under the 
protection of the Swiss Red Cross, that he was responsible for us. And he talked to this man 
and talked and talked and talked until he fina
lly said, "Okay. You're responsible for them. 
We will clear that with our authorities whether th
is is correct and you make sure that they are 
not going anywhere."  After they had cleared out
 and daybreak came, we left in a hurry and 
went into the woods and were all day long in
 the woods and were picked up in the early 

evening and were dispersed to various homes. 
And I stayed actually on two different farms 
for a total of about four weeks. The farms 
-- each one had an encounter with the French 
police in one farm, we were hidden behind a w
ood pile which was very cleverly put up in 
that it shaped was U-shaped up against th
e wall and you could pull out one bundle of wood 
and we would crawl in there and sit in there. There was just enough room for the other girl 

and myself to sit in there. It was totally c
overed up top. You could not
 look in from the top. 
And we were sitting in this wood pile and then you, of course, put this one bundle of wood 
back in so there was no opening. We  were s
itting in there until they left. And your heart 
beats very fast and very hard and you're scar
ed until they leave. In the second farm, again 
there was the police comi ng around and there we 
were hidden in a closet behind old clothes 
with a row of shoes in front of us and we were standing in there totally quiet.  
 
01:41:28 
 
 
                        
Now, we were on the upper floor of this farm
. The police was downstairs in the kitchen. And 
we could hear them ask the farmers, "Do 
you have any Jews here? "   And the farmer 
answering, "What are Jews?  We don't know what that is, but would you rather have a glass 

of wine."  And we in the cl
oset hoped they would say no, because it was a little bit tight in 
this armoire and so eventually they left and we
 could come  out. So we were very, very lucky. 
And four weeks later, we came back to the 
village. The razzias had stopped for the moment 
and it also helped me  to ma ke up my mi nd. Ev
en before that actually, when I came back 
from Gurs after I saw my mother that as safe 
as Le Chambon is, we need to get out. We need 
to get out of the country. And I told my fr
iends and I told the young people in the student 
home Les Roches
12
. There were some  friends of my 
husband there; there was a map on the 
wall and I said, "You see where we are here and this is where we have to go," pointing to 
Switzerland, and they looked at me like I ha
d lost my mi nd. And I said, "No. We  cannot 
stay. No ma tter what, we cannot stay."  And so eventually, I did. 
 
Q: Okay. Before we go on that trip with you-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would you tell us please. You had a visit, 
I believe, in Le Chambon by the head of the 
Protestant Church in France.

A: You refer to Pastor Boegner
13
? 
 
Q: Yes. Please, would you tell me about that visit and your part in it. 
 
A: Yes. Okay. When I came back from Gurs and 
the short stop I made to see my then boyfriend 
obviously having seen my mother deported and 
the last thing I saw of her was a white 
handkerchief fluttering out of the cattle ca
r. I don't know whether you can.– No, you cannot 
understand what emotions you are going through, 
and I came back to Le Chambon and I had 
to bring a horrible message to my friends becaus
e most of their parents had been deported at 
the same time. And within -- I don't know whether it -- I do not remember whether it was the 
same day or several days later but it doesn't  
really matter. There was a get together and I 
believe -- I cannot be sure anymore -- it mi ght ha
ve been in the Côteau Fleuri where Pastor 
Boegner addressed the people who were there a
nd I went there. I don't remember who went 
with me. It is sort of a blank. He was telli
ng us we should be calm and confident and nothing 
is going to happen and so on and so forth and af
ter having had the experience that I just had, 
I just became very angry and I confronted th
e man and said, "Instead of telling us these 
things, why don't you do some thing?  Rather than
 talking, do something."  I did not know at 
the time who Pastor Boegner was. He was just
 another ma n. A ma n who was giving a speech 
that to me was totally ridiculous. And so I c
onfronted him with that. And I don't think if I 
had known who Pastor Boegner was, I think I would still have done the same  thing. 
 
01:45:08 
 
Q: What did he say?  
 
A: There was no answer as far as I remember. Wh
at's there to answer. There was no answer to, 
to, you know, be calm. Rema in confident. How can you rema in calm in the face of what was 
going on?  Or what I had just experienced?  So that
 was my confrontation 
with the head of the 
Protestant Church. 
 
Q: What did you do next?  
 
A: Next?  We ll, then we went into hiding. That 
was after my confrontation. Pastor Trocmé  was 
very upset that day with me when I came back
 that I did not first report to him what had 
happened and it was really not on my mi nd to go to
 him and to tell him. I did not realize they 
had really worried if I ever even would 
come  back and not get caught on the way. The 
thought never entered my mi nd. And I didn't go th
ere. I just didn't see any reason actually. 
Now I know what he wanted to know from me . But 
at that time all I knew is that I had to tell 
my friends what happened. That was the overw
helming feeling and terrible duty I had to do. 
And everything else was wiped off the slate. 
So, he was angry with me . I learned that 
afterwards. And it really didn't matter.

Q: You have come  back and told your friends?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you'd pointed to them happened and said, this is what we have to do? " 
 
A: Well, this was a couple of days later when I told them this is what we will have to do. 
 
Q: Pick up with that story, please. What did 
you do next?  What did you do about that or did it 
take awhile? 
 
A: We ll on my way back, as I me ntioned, I saw 
my boyfriend. I told him to come  up to Le 
Chambon if things become  difficult where he is 
because I was sure that there would be help, 
that he would be safe. And he did come . 
And he told you how he found me  on the way 
walking from one house to the other. And wait 
a mi nute. Now I have to think a moment. I 
lost my thought. Excuse me . What did we do?  
Oh. Yeah. When I came back out of hiding, I 
was moved to another home, also of the Swiss Red Cross where there were smaller children. 

And I helped for several months to take care 
of these children. We had an outbreak in this 
house of lice, head lice. Nothing unusual! My 
wonderful job was to clean them up in the 
evening. Have them all nice and clean. Send th
em off to school the next morning, only for 
them to come  back with a new batch, which th
ey picked up in school. So, it was an evening 
exercise to clean the children up. And I did that
 for several months helped with the children, 
helped with whatever had to be done in the hom
e. In the meantime, I was in touch with my 
family in Switzerland.  
 
01:49:00 
 
 My mother's sister was married in Switzerland since the beginning of the century. I made it 
clear to them in letters; I said I wanted to le
ave and said I wanted to come and stay with 
them. And they, in turn, found a woma n who a
rranged for crossings into Switzerland. What 
they first did, however, was to apply for a vi
sa for me to enter Switzerland legally. Now I 

could never use this visa to enter Switzerland 
legally as a immi grant because I could not get 
an exit visa out of France. Mr. Bohny had at the 
time tried to get an exit visa for me. I made 
the application which, of course, was turned down. And so I could never physically take 

possession of this precious visa to go to Swit
zerland. And so in February of 43, through this 
woma n my family had found, a ma n was found ve
ry close to the Swiss border who would 
literally take me across the border. I made my
 way alone from Le Chambon to Annema sse. I 
met this guide in Annemasse. There were three or
 four, five other peopl
e which he crossed at 
the same time, so we were a group of six that 
he crossed over into Switzerland that night. His 
crossing over consisted of carrying us across th
e little stream physically so we would not be 
wet, depositing us on the other side and saying, 
"Now you have to walk in such and such a 
direction and you will then meet the street car 
that will take you into Geneva, and you get off 
at a certain station in Geneva and there will 
be a contact person who will take you to a small 
hotel for the night."  And this is how I en
tered Switzerland. Once I was on Swiss soil, I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
14 
 
perfectly legal, not like my husband who entere
d as a refugee. So it was a long while my 
husband had a guide all the way with his frie
nds. I had no one. Mr. Bohny happened to be on 
the train when I left the next village. I did not board the train in Le Chambon. I  boarded the 
train in Tence which is the little town below. A
nd he was on the train; and he went with me 
as far as, I believe, Saint-Étienne. And then of course from Saint-Étienne to Lyon. From 
there on, I was on my own. And the railroad sta
tion in Lyon was full of German soldiers 
because all of France was already occupied at this time. This was February of 1943. 
 
01:52:21 
 
Q: We re you accosted in any way on the course of this journey?  
 
A: I was accosted? No. Not really. Once when I got
 out of the train, I believe, in Annecy I had 
to show my false identification papers. I mean 
to them -- to me I knew they were false. To 
them, they were supposed to be real. There was a guard there, asked everybody for his 

identification papers, and I showed him and 
I walked on. And then when I walked to 
Annemasse on the road, there was a little custom
s building and I fi gured well, it's war time. 
This is ridiculous. What customs?  What tra
ffic can there be between France and Switzerland 
and I walked on. And he called me  back. And I 
had to show him my papers. And I did. And 
then he said, "Are you Jewish? "   And I don't 
know where the answer came  from, but it came 
as, "I have nothing to do with 
that dirty race."  And I really don't know where this answer 
came from, but it came. And he sort of smiled and let me  go. 
 
Q: Okay. What happened now once you have gotten into Geneva?  
 
A: In Geneva I was this one night in this little hot
el and I told this contact person to immediately 
call my family. It was around 11:30 at night. Sh
e said, "But it's 11:30 at night."  I said, 
"Never mi nd the time. Please call."  And she 
did. And my aunt came the next morning to 
pick me  up. And I lived with my family for a year and a half. 
 
Q: Would you describe the conditions in Switzerland at that time, living in that house?  
 
A: Living in this house with my aunt and uncle 
was extremely difficult. They had absolutely no 
understanding of what I had lived through, what 
I had experienced. They were very nice, 
solid, extremely well-to-do Swiss citizens. Pe
ople cannot understand really and truly what 
you went through, and my history is easy co
mpared to what people went through in 
Auschwitz or Dachau or Majdanek or any of 
the other camps. So yet, here I was, 18 years 

old, or a little older, with all of these expe
riences: having experienced death many times over 
to some of my -- the people around me, and their life has always been 
a very bourgeois life. 
So how can they understand?  I was 18, and my unc
le was in his 70s so -- and very Victorian. 
So right here was a tremendous clash. And now 
I was supposed to live the life of the very 
nice bourgeois girl. Impossible! And so ther
e were many clashes and whenever I did 
something that was not quite the way it was 
supposed to be my aunt would say, "What 

would your mother say? "  Well, one day I ha
d enough of what would my mother say and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
15 
 
said, "Why don't you leave her alone. She's dead."  
And this was the one thing really that my 
aunt could not admit and confront because rightfully she had to feel gu
ilty for the loss of my 
mother. Simply because they had not done e
nough to get her out of the camp. The problem 
always was money. Okay. So even my life would 
not have been saved if not my cousin, her 
daughter-in-law, would not have put them 
to shame by saying, "How long will you wait or 
do you wait before you do some thing and will she ha
ve to be lost also before you move?" 
But I didn't know that when I was in France that
 my cousin at the same time was working on 
the family. But my life with my relatives was 
very difficult. It was extremely difficult, and 
eventually I left without permission to leave the 
city of Bern and took a job as a ma id with a 
Bulgarian family, also refugees, in Geneva. And at the same time I was in Geneva and I got 
the job through the offices Mademoiselle de Montmollin, who was running the social -- the 
course where my husband took social services 
-- that social services course my husband 
took. So here we were in Geneva. 
 
Q: Let's hold it a mi nute. Let us change tapes. 
 
A: Yeah,okay.

Q: Guilt in your mother's death. Could you describe that a little more?  
 
A: I don't know that my uncle felt guilt. I do th
ink my aunt did. I really do. Why he did not 
really help more than the little amounts of m
oney that he would send us into the camp, I 
cannot understand. 
 
Q: Who else was lost?  
 
A: Other than my mother?  My mother's brother 
and his wife, his daughter
 and son-in-law. That 
was the immediate family. 
 
Q: And your uncle had enough money that he could help?  
 
A: He could have helped. He could have done a lot more. A lot more. 
 
Q: You told me  when the camera was off what your uncle would say. Could you repeat that?  
 
A: We ll, my uncle, having a number of houses, tw
o for his private use, one his business house, 
which he shared with his brother. Whenever the question of money came  around and 
financial help he would say, "Well, I can't  eat th
e bricks of my houses."  Okay. So this ended 
any argument. I mean what can you say to that. How can you argue with some one like that. 
You weren't supposed to argue with some one
 that age when you were young. Right. In any 
case, I took a job finally as a maid with Bulgar
ian people in Geneva. This situation with my 
family really drove me to the brink of a ne
rvous breakdown. It really did. In Geneva, I was 
quite happy with these people. They were very
 nice people. The man had been formally a 
diplomat, quit his position because he was anti-
Nazi. He was very much involved in the 
Bulgarian underground; they were really very
 nice people. They lived on a shoe string, 
mostly selling jewelry fr om his mother to make
 ends meet. They were very nice, and they 
were very nice to me. My husband and I got marri
ed in Geneva in April of 1945, and at this 
time we asked permission that I could join him 
in the internment home, and this request was 
granted. And in 1946, our daughter was born in
 March -- 4th of March, 1946, our daughter 
was born in Vevey. She was one good point. Look, we me t a lot of very nice Swiss people.  
 
02:03:55 
 
 
Very helpful people. Lovely people we are still fr iends with. And while the Swiss did take us 
in, reluctantly, our life in Switzerland was extr
emely difficult. We were always considered 
the dirty refugees. Okay. My husband was once ha
nded in Geneva a whole list of restaurants 
where he was not allowed to go because ther
e was dancing in these restaurants, and you 
were not allowed to fraternize with the Swi
ss, quote, unquote. There was a whole -- a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
17 
 
harassment, if you wish. The Swiss governme nt
 knew very well that there was no place for 
us to go until the end of the war, yet I, as an i
mmigrant, had to have my visa or permit to stay 
in Switzerland renewed every six months and 
every six months, "Why aren't  you leaving?  
Can't you go any other place? "  The governme nt
 knew we could not go any other place. 
There was always this under current of resentment. Always! And it was a very difficult time. 
 
Q: At the war's end?  
 
02:05:28 
 
A: At the war's end! Yes. 
 
Q: And by 1946, what did you do and where did you go?  
 
A: Well, in -- well, I had my daughter in 1946. We were in the home in Montreux, to be precise, 
in Territet. I was busy with the baby and again, 
I came down with a case of pleurisy and I did 
not do very much. My husband was in the offi ce of
 the home. I did a little bit of offi ce work, 
but nothing to talk about. Everybody had to do so
mething. Then came the moment where the 
Swiss government decided that any immi grant liv
ing in the home has to leave. Now this, of 
course, applied to me . Now what do you do?  You ha
ve an infant that can stay in the home. 
My husband is in the home, but I have to leav
e. So we rented a room in Montreux. It's -- 
Okay?  I had to take my meals outside. Okay. After some length of time, the government 
decided that I could come back into the home b
ecause after all the child was there, and I had 
to take care of the little one but I would have 
to pay room and board. I had to pay room and 
board at the same rate as the Swiss empl
oyees who were running the home -- the Swiss 

admi nistration. So, it wasn't  much, but it was 
a lot for us. At the same time, the Swiss 
government had a very great dilemma. Namely th
at our daughter had a refugee father and an 
immi grant mother. What should the child be?  
Refugee or immi grant?  Now children born in 
Switzerland are not automatically citizens like th
ey are in the United States. That does not 
happen. So after lengthy discussion, the Swiss d
ecided she should be a refugee. Otherwise, 
we would have had to pay for her as well. Okay. So they ma de her a refugee. Does that tell 

you how people were harassed?  Okay. Little things. Unimportant things. 
 
Q: How long did you stay there?  
 
02:08:30 
 
A: We could not immi grate before February of
 1948. It was a ma tter of 
not having an affidavit 
and my relatives here had to find them. They themselves did not have enough funds to give 

an affidavit, so they had to find some one to give
 us an affidavit. And eventually they did; the 
ma n gave us an affidavit with the understandi
ng that we would never become a charge to 
him because you guarantees it if something happe
ns, they take care of you, that the family 
would. And under these -- with this agreement, he gave the affidavit and eventually we came 

here on the 3rd of March 1948. So we were eight years on the road so to speak. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0133 
18 
 
                        
 
Q: Will you tell me a little about settling here, the first years in the United States?  
 
A: The first years were extremely difficult. First 
of all, our total assets when we came were 
exactly $90 for the three of us. The first week 
we were in New York relatives of ours paid 
for our room and board at the Stephen Wi se 
home, on the West Side 70s in Manhattan, but 
after that it was be on your own. And luck
ily enough, my husband found a job within ten 
days after comi ng here, so we had a little bit of money. My husband told you that he went to 
the HIAS
14
 to get some help the first few days -- which, of course, was no help. And, but one 
of the things they first said before they w
ould help, you have to m
ove out of the Stephen 
Wi se home and you have to move into one of
 our hotels which was the Hotel Marseille on 
Broadway and, I think, on 100th Str
eet, I believe it was. It was a terrible place to be. So as 
soon as we could and my husband was ma king a 
few dollars, we moved out of there into 
another one-room hotel situation. And during th
at summer, my husband got sick and I was 
sick. And our daughter was first with my rela
tives upstate for about six weeks. And when 
this episode was over, he found another job a
nd eventually things started to move along a 
little bit. In September of -- no, not in Sept
ember. In November of 1950, I started to 
hemorrhage during the night. I coughed and I started to hemorrhage and went to the hospital 

the next morning. They took an X-ray and here 
I had a wonderful case of TB,  The next step 
in this situation is, of course, that the family has to be X-rayed, and look here, who also had 

TB was my husband. So now we are both sick. And here's the little child. So the hospital 

social services was very good to us. They referred us to the Jewish Child Care
15
, who placed 
our daughter into a foster home, and at our request
 she did not stay in the City of New York.  
 
02:12:09 
 
 I was scared to death to leav
e her in the City of New York. I was afraid that she would be 
playing in the street and no one would properl
y supervise her and she would get hurt. So I 
requested that she be placed outside of the c
ity. And so she was placed out on the island with 
a very, very lovely woma n who had taken in 
foster children for many years, and she just 
knew how to handle these children and she did a te
rrific job. So that was, so that was really 
two years. We  were almost away for two year
s in the sanatorium. The child was away two 

and a half years, and when we came  back from the sanatorium, my husband was enrolled in 

a school, which came under the rehabilitation progr
am of the State of New York, and he 
became an accountant and he completed a program
 in nine months which really takes two 
years. So he worked very hard and studied very
 hard to do it so quickly so that he could go 
back to work and earn a living. Well, that was our beginning this country.  
 
Q: Quite a beginning! Is there anything you would like to add?  
 
A: No. I don't think so unless you have some  question to ask me .

Q: I want to thank you very much for comi ng. It's quite a story. Thank you. 
 
Q: Ah, yes. Now we shall show some  passports and papers and things like that. 
 
A: I want you to know that my brother got his vi
sa to come to this country in 1937 by the same 
Mr. Teller that gave us the visa in 1948 in Sw
itzerland. Is this wild?  And I have his passport 
still. And I met Mr. Teller once before, because my brother was killed in action in 1945 in 
Luxembourg in the Battle of the Bulge. 
 
Q: That's good. I wanted to me ntion that on tape. 
 
A: And, well, he joined the Army here. 
 
Q: Would you go back a little and tell me about your brother please? 
 
A: My brother, like my husband, ma de public school. He then went to gymnasium. 
 
Q: Not the whole thing. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: But I would like to know what happened to your brother. How did he get to this country?  
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: But I would like to know what happened to your brother. How did he get to this country?  
 
02:15:10 
 
A: To this country?  Okay. My brother came here in 1937. My father had a half-brother here in 
the United States who was willing to help hi
m to get out of Germany and gave him an 
affidavit to come  here. So he was 16 years old 
when he came to this country. He first stayed 
with his uncle and his aunt and that was not 
a good experience either. And then was more or 
less on his own. He was lucky to get a  scholarsh
ip to a university down in Atlanta and later 
on came back to New York and worked for Pilot
16
, the radio -- they made radios and stuff 
like that. He had taken this up down at the unive
rsity and eventually, of course, when the war 
broke out, he volunteered. The first two times they
 did not take him. And the third time, my 
uncle, who had come  in 1939 from Germany, sa
id he was his guardian, which he was not, 
and signed the papers that it would be alright for 
him to join the army. So he joined the army, 
and eventually was shipped over to Europe, wa
s with Patton's Third Army, and was in the 
Battle of the Bulge, and was killed on a mi ssi
on for which he volunteered. Just never came 
back. His buddy, who was also his friend from 
Germany. They were buddies in the army.

They were buddies in Germany. We nt on one
 mi ssion. My brother went on the other 
mi ssion. My brother didn't come back. The other one
 did. That's fate. So my brother left me 
his GI insurance, life insurance, and this is what pulled us through. It sounds horrible in 
many ways, but when this first came through we were still in Switzerland and so I had to go 

to the consulate in Zurich to get the papers straightened out and at that time I met Mr. Teller, 
the consul in Zurich, formerly in Stuttgart,
 and he signed the papers and made the snide 
remark, "What are you going to do with all of 
that money? "  All of this money was $10,000, 
which was paid, as you know, in monthly installments of $50. 
 
Q: You encountered Mr. Teller again, I believe. 
 
A: I encountered Mr. Teller again when he gave us
 the visa to come to this country. He's the 
same  ma n who signed the visa for my husband -- excuse me , for my brother, in 1937 in 

Stuttgart.
