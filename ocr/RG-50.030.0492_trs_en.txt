PAUL PEETERS 
 December 22, 2004 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memo
rial Museum interview with Mr. Paul Peeters, 
conducted by Ina Navazelskis, on We dnesday, December 22
nd
, 2004, in Washington, D.C.. This 
is tape number one, side A. Mr. Peeters, could yo
u tell us where you were born, what -- the date 
of your birth, town, circumstances, a
nd a little bit about
 your early life. 
Answer: Oh, very good, yes. I was born in a -- first 
of all in a fairly large, I me an a locally very 
well known fa mily, very big family and you know, m-
my fa mily has been in the sugar industry 
and so on, and -- and with connections in the Be
lgium industry and so on, but at the time I was 
totally imma ture and -- no I -- well, I -- I went 
through the -- the experience you are interested in, 
it was about 1920, and -- but very 
me ntally imma ture. And for instance, we knew absolutely 
nothing about the suffering the Jewish people were 
-- underwe nt, but the war broke out in my n -
- country, actually 
in May -- on May 10
th
, 1940. 
Q: And at that point, can you tell 
it -- back up a little bit, can we 
back up a little bit and -- and fill 
in the cont ext somewhat. 
A: The -- th-th --  

Q: The town was what name , what was the name  of the town? 

A: The name -- the town, it™s one of the oldest to
wn in that part of the world, that was Torgny. 
Q: Torgny, and -- mm-hm?  

A: In Belgium, in Belgium, on the French border. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes.

Q: And -- 
A: And I studied, you know, I had a norma l Catholic
 education, high school and so on, and then -
- I studied then my --  

Q: What does --  

A: -- university. 

Q: Excuse me . What does norma l Catholic edu
cation for a place like Torgny at that time mean? 
A: Well at first I was in the so
-called bourgeois, 
you know, level. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And at that time , you know, the classes and so
 on were still quite, not segregated, but there 
was a -- a fact -- a separation -- f
actual separation, so I 
lived very much in that kind of a -- not 
privileged, but I would say self-contained world,
 me ntally, values and so on. I don™t want to be 
critical, but you have 
to realize how -- 
Q: Was it an upper mi ddle class fam
ily?  Is that how you would say it? 
A: No -- yeah, upper mi ddle class, yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you said you had ma ny children in your 
family. How ma ny brot
hers and sisters? 
A: No, not me , but m- my mother, my parents. 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: Yes, about 12. 

Q: 12? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oh my. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
3 
 
 
A: Yes, unusual, not [indecipherable] 
Q: That™s quite a lot. And where were you? 

A: We  always had servants and so on, and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: No, it™s a kind of life, you know, you -- nobody 
has the experience [indecipherable] in the 
country and so on, and gardeners, and 
we had that kind of [indecipherable] 
Q: Can you tell me  how much -- how ma ny brothe
rs an-and where you were in the -- in the 
brothers and sisters hierarchy? 

A: Sure. I -- I don™t know, I must have been seventh or some thing. So -- 

Q: And you were born in what year? 

A: I -- born, well that™s a very
 discreet question. I™m 20 -- 1921, at the end of 1921, so I™ll be 83, 

in other words, very shortly. 

Q: Okay, here in to -- in the year 2004. 
A: I [indecipherable] show 
respect to my age, mm? 
Q: Of course, of course, of course. So you say you 
were sort of in the mi ddle of all of the large 
fa mily of siblings, you we re number seven, or -- or -- 

A: [indecipherable] yes, yes. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And wa -- did you -- were most of the child
ren boys, or girls, or a mi x, or -- did everybody go 
to school? 

A: No, but -- I suppose there were more girls than
 -- I -- I™ve never asked 
myself that question. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
4 
 
 
A: No, we were about six -- six boys. 
Q: Six boys? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And were they mostly older than you or younger than you? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. I don™t know, really. No, I was 
in the mi ddle as far as the boys were concerned, 
exactly in the mi ddle. 

Q: Mm-hm. And you studied 
at a Catholic school?   
A: Yes, yes 

Q: You went to Catholic high school? 

A: Yes, when I -- when the -- the story, which I 
was involved in, I was stud
ying at the -- a Jesuit 
I don™t whether you understand what it means, a school in Namur, N -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- N-a-m- u-r. And that™s where I met 
that -- that priest, you know, and those -- 
Q: Wa s this after high school al
ready, at university level? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: At university but on -- at the 
lower level, just  the college, or  even lower college , I would call 
it, yeah. 

Q: And wha t  were 
your studies there? 
A: I™m sorry? 

Q: What were your studies there, in Na mur? 

A: Oh, nondescript program [indeci
pherable] it could -- it -- it wa
s called philosophy and letters. 
You have nothing like this up [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
5 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So i-it™s some thing which could have le
d, you know, to ma ny differe
nt choices, and so on. 
Q: We re you alone from your fa mily?  Is Namur far from the town that you grew up in? 

A: No, no.  

Q: No, it was close? 

A: They all -- they studied there. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you were not alone from your fa m
ily when you were studying there, you -- 
A: I was alone in -- in that place, at the -- that co
llege, but I™m not the first 
in the family to go to -
- to college if that is -- is
 the meaning of your question. 
Q: No, no, no. My question is, when the war brokes
 out -- broke out, were you alone, away from 
your fa mily, studying -- 

A: I was alone -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- when I was there, and so on, but of course
, d-during the war conditi
on we had, the traveling 
was not restr -- I mean, it was restricted, and not
 taken for granted, the normal ti me s, so -- 
Q: Mm-hm. Can you tell us a little bit more 
about your childhood, about the town that you grew 
up in?  You me ntioned some thing about the su
gar industry. In what way was your family 
involved?  What we™re tryi
ng to do is get a sense of the comm
unity and the values and the world 
that you grew up in, so whatever you could te
ll us about that child 
-- those childhood years -- 
A: We ll, that childhood was extremely happy, you 
see, I -- I never went to gramma r school 
because I was too good to be sent  to, you know, 
that country school. We were living in the 
country, and -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
6 
 
 
A: -- well, I enjoyed -- I was very happy at the 
time , and just no -- we had no worries, and then 
came -- you see, the Great Depression, beca -- at th
at time, because a -- the fa mily business was a 
sugar producing and also [indecipherable] owning lo
ts of farms and so on and so we were very 
involved in the agricultural way. And then my 
grandfather was a very capable and creative 
businessman, but he did not train, you see, his 
children and so on and so they were a background 
also [indecipherable] and that sort of thing, becau
se the economic situation in western Europe at 
that time wa s difficult, particularly in th
e area of agricultural 
production and so on.  
Q: Mm-hm. And in the sugar business, is -- th
at was some thing your fath
er himself was involved 
in? 
A: No, no, that™s the family business -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- so he was the owner of one part, part 
general stockholder and so on, and -- and also 
ma nager, yes, yes, and -- 
Q: I see. 
A: -- so that was entirely private thing, and just 
a -- but the times were th -- because the prices 
were going up and down and then the harvests
, you know, were long and difficult and so on. 
Q: You -- 

A: I think there was a catastrophic year
, I forgot when it was, 1935 or so. 
Q: And you me ntioned before that when the war occurred -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you were -- you see yourself as so
me body who was totally unprepared -- 
A: Unprepared. 

Q: -- fo-for what had happened fo -- afterwards. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
7 
 
 
A: And it happened very suddenly because, you 
know, the war was declared by France and 
England. I think it was on September -- on Septembe
r first, Germany invaded Poland, right? And 
then there wa s a, I don™t know, an ultima tum or
 some thing, and the war between Germany and 
England and France started on -- I think on September third, and then there was a period, you 
know, a long period of neutrality and 
suspense and so on, and then on -- 
Q: In Belgium?  

A: -- May the 10
th
 -- 
Q: In Belgium, you s -- 

A: -- [indecipherable] in Belgium, ye ah. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And on May the 10
th
, the German invaded Be lgium and Holland if I am correct, and so on. 
Then th-tha t -- 

Q: Do you reme mber that? 
A: -- for me  who was still a -- a teenager, was 
a child, it came very suddenl y, because all -- in 
our y-younger years, you know, we
 heard stories about the atro
cities and suffering during the 
first World War, which was still reasonably close at
 the time, so -- so we were frightened, but we 
didn™t know what we feared. 
Q: Do you have a me mo ry of when the invasi
on occurred?  Do you reme mber where you were at 
the time? 

A: Sure, sure, sure. 

Q: Can you tell us about that? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
8 
 
 
A: Well, the -- I was al ready in Namur at the ti
me, and then I think there was some  bombing and 
so on, and then -- then we left for France and so on, 
so -- so there is a -- was a retreat -- I me an, a 
-- we left the house, and so on the -- and then the 
-- there were battle and so on, just -- but well, 
that™s -- that is not so clear in my me mo
ry, just that -- I just reme mber vaguely. 
Q: How -- did you return to Namur at any time? 
A: Yes, yes, of course -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- we return, and then -- and then the -- 
I don™t know, I -- I -- I th
ink the studies were 
interrupted, but it was -- no, I -- a
nd I -- and wa -- 1941 I was back -- back to Namur, a nd so on. 
And then I -- I me t that -- that priest, you 
know, who took care of those Jewish boys and so on. 
Q: Can you tell me  a little bit about how 
you me t this priest , what his name  was? 
A: I-I have  no recollection of how 
I met the m, but i -- it™s an en
tirely extraordinary story. If you 
want -- did you want me to go 
into what I know of his -- 
Q: What was his name? What were the circumstances -- 

A: His name  was Jose-Joseph -- you see, now I have a -- excuse me . 

Q: It™s okay. 

A: I™m getting old. I never thought I would forg
et his name . [indecipherable]. Oh, that™s 
ridiculous. It will come  back. 

Q: That™s okay. It happens some ti me s. 

A: Yes, it -- no, i-it was an extraord
 -- a very se nsitive, young priest  -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- a parish priest, and then he was transf
erred some place, semi nary where he was teaching, 
and it was a very extraordinary, heroic kind of ma n, 
very sensitive, and at the same  time he could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
9 
 
 
be -- violently could get fits of anger and so on, but not at all,  you know, resentme nts, so on, just 
because at times he was -- I mean, he was oversensitive. And then he was -- you are -- now are 

going to the substance of my -- 

Q: Yeah, I™d like to find out more how -- how 
it is that you got involved in this activity. 

A: That -- I have no me mory of it. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Why, I just got involved. I suppose I me
t him, or somebody told me about it. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But the story is that there 
was a parish house in -- on a sort 
of [indecipherable] and so on, but 
that is very local, it™s not to be comp ared to
 the setting of Wa shingt
on, it was very simple. And 
there was a parish house here, and th
en next to it, exactly next to
 it, the same  wall, there was a 
big hotel before the war, which was occupied
 by the German Gestapo and various German 
services in that town. So we had a wall, and wh
en I was sitting with the wall, I coul d hear the 
German offi cers on the outside. And then that 
priest, you know, slowly 
-- I -- I -- I suppose he 
was in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with 
the various Jewish idi 
-- organization. But we 
had as ma ny as 20 boys in that house, you see, an
d on the first floor was a sort of a big room 
with a theater and so on, where the boys could at
 least take some  exerci
se. And then, on the top 
there were his office and so on. And the boys actu
ally lived in that house, you see, for -- they 

could not go out, right?  And -- a
nd that™s the reason why he got in touch with me , be cause we 
wanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I 

suppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys
 and so on, right, and then the Jewish 
children joined them and so -- so they 
could get some exerci
se and fresh air. 

Q: So, if I can understand this correctly, ther
e was a house that belong
ed to the college -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
10 
 
 
A: To the parish, or to the -- 
Q: Uh-huh, to the parish in Namur. 

A: I shou -- in Namur, yes. 

Q: Yeah. And the priest who lived in the house -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- it was -- it was -- 

A: It was a parish house for certain fu
nctions, I suppose the 
parish functions. 
Q: And he was the one who 
started saving the children. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And were these -- how old was the range, 
the age range of the children who were  
A: Oh, the children, I could not say, I would say about
 seven -- the -- we -- as far as I recall, we 
have no sma ll children and so on, they were 
all, you know, beginning 
teenagers and so on.  
Q: So they were -- uh-huh. 
A: And no more than 12, I would say. 
Q: And wha t  was -- 

A: But then of course, they 
change. You see, there was -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- a rotation. I -- I 
don™t know, I -- yeah. 
Q: How was  -- what was your involveme nt in it?  
Was it that you were a group of other boys -- 
A: My involveme nt was pure, not charity. I was 
-- as I told you, I wa
s imma ture, I didn™t know 
what I was doing. I was very happy to do it. I had 
a great, not love, but I mean I liked the boys, I 
seem to remember some of them. So -- and -- but
 my function, what I actu
ally did was simply to 
take them out with other friends.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
11 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. And so you would take them out -- 
A: So I -- 

Q: -- for playing and for exercise? 

A: -- to -- yeah, yeah, and exercise
 and play ball, and that sort of
 thing and so on. But -- and then, 
you see that -- so, we had 
the Gestapo next door -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- right?  And then, on the first floor, and then there was a roof, you see, on -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- on the top of the house, w
ithout any heating, with ma ttre
sses on the fl oor. And at times I 
saw with my  own eyes there™s some thing -- some
time  15 children and so on. A-And mo stly -- 

most of them, if I a m correct, I don™t -- came from Poland and Vienna. 

Q: Did you get -- did you have 
a common language that you -- 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. 

Q: I see, so you never -- 

A: We ll, of course the -- they knew su -- 
I don™t know -- know, r
eally. Communication was 
rather poor in the sense -- because most of th
em had language problems, right, and actually the 
priest, after the -- after 
the -- I mean the liberation of the c
ountry, created si -- courses in -- in 
Hebrew for -- for the boys. And the most important
 part of my testimony as far as I™m concerned, 
that I believe, I don™t know th
at, but -- I don™t know
 how ma ny, but certainly perhaps a thousand 
boys, over the years, you know, we nt through that system. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
12 
 
 
Q: So there -- about -- over a thousand boys were
 -- went through the school, through this house 
--  

A: No, no, no, no -- 

Q: -- excuse me , this house 
that they were saving -- 
A: -- they we re -- they just were -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- they we re sheltered there, they found a sh
elter. But you have to realize th-th-the that e-
extraordinary, absolutely extraordinar y to keep boys -- 

Q: Next to the -- 

A: -- and I never witness any -- you know, any la
ck of discipline or anything there. The boys, 
most of them were so conscious of their situa
tion and -- and so disciplin
ed and so on. But I want 
-- I wanted to say two things. The first thing is
 that as far as I know, only one boy who I changed 
his fate, you know, so [indecipherable] it was part of
 the system to protect the Jewish -- and also 
perhaps even more than the Jewish aspect, the -- 
the authority of the parents. And that was very 
beautiful, I never forgot that. We ll, that™s one 
thing, and the second thing again, as far as I know, 
not one boy was caught and so he
 saved them, really save -- 
Q: That was one of my questions, is the fate of 
these children, as far as you knew it, that these 

children did not fall into th
e hands of the Gestapo, who were right next -- 
A: They did not. 

Q: They did not. 

A: No. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Th-Then one day, a father of 
one of our boys was shot to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
13 
 
 
Q: Excuse me  for a second -- [tape break] -- uh-huh? 
A: For a day and night. Cause that™s what I said
, the Germans also heard, you see, voices, and I-I 
-- I -- I never understood
 how he could ma intain, you know, 
that th -- type of discipline 
necessary for thei r safety, for their protection. 

Q: Did -- 

A: And in addition -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- there was, of course, an enormous problem 
of feeding them. You see,
 every citizen received 
coupons or stamps and so on, and so we had to find food and nourishment for those boys. And -- 

and we ha -- had not only to prepare the meal, a nd then but al-also to feed them, and to avoid 

noises and so on. And quite frankly, I never 
understood how it was achieved, and sin -- and so 
on, because it -- 

Q: We re any of your friends 
involved in this as well? 
A: No, no, yeah, I-I mys e lf only came, only on S
undays and Saturdays, so I -- I was not an 
outsider, but I was not involved in
 the actually daily routine of the -- of the shelter. And so i -- 
you have to -- also to understand that there wa
s a network around that 
place, you see, providing 
food, nourishment and so on. There was an er -- a tr
uly heroic nurse who was heading sort of an 
office -- sort of Red Cros s offices, where the boys 
were treated and so on. Bu -- and all that was 
in -- achieving sec -- complete secrecy and so on
. And that person, after having given herself to 
that work for three year -- three 
years, on the very last day, a fe
w days before the liberation, she 
got -- she was killed in a bombing, and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the 

wall [indecipherable]. And it was a truly -- I 
mean, extraordinary pe
rson, extra -- a nurse 
[indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
14 
 
 
Q: Do you reme mber her name? 
A: No, her name  I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know?   

A: I forgot, because you know I -- all these sad 
experiences has been extremely deep, I mean 
[indecipherable] really attached, but I did not 
follow it through. For -- 
for instance, if you had 
informed me that -- this intervie
w, I would have gone to talk to 
people [indecipherable] but th -- 
Q: It™s okay. 

A: -- no, it -- it™s not important, no. 

Q: No, it -- it™s simply -- it™s n 
-- it™s helpful to have the name
 of the person you are talking 
about, if you reme mber it. 

A: Yes, yes, yes, mm-hm. 

Q: And if not it™s -- it™s --  

A: No, no, no. 
Q: -- we can leave it by the side. We re there any 
of -- any other of your friends that you knew of, 
even if not directly, who in some  
way were involved in the sheltering? 
A: Yes, of course, of course, 
there were a -- a number of -- w
hy, as a matter of fact, I -- very 
recently I got in touch with a -- who is now al -- 
a priest also, but he wa
s a boy at the time  of 
those events, and he had known that Jo
seph Andre -- now the name  come s - -  
Q: See?  Mr. Joseph Andre was the priest. 
A: The priest, the name -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- of the priest. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
15 
 
 
A: So I -- I was saying yes, I -- I know that yeah
, tha -- h-he was a boy at the time  and that priest 
came to his fath -- his parents had 
a little farm or some thing -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- and so they got supply, I mean the -- th
e shelter got supplies from them, and so -- 
Q: Excuse me , can you repeat 
that?  I didn™t fu
lly understand. 
A: You didn™t understand, no?  No, I just me t recently -- 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: -- the priest, who was younger than me , and 
when he was a child, his parents supplied 
potatoes and eggs and so on and so -- 

Q: To the school -- to the boys, mm- h m.  

A: Bu-But the ma in -- th-the one who workedmost with the -- the priest and myself, died 

recently. So should I continue?   

Q: Oh yes, please. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Yes, yes, please. 

A: So, if you want, I-I could tell 
you how this extraordinary experience ended, so -- becau -- ah 
yes, I was telling you that the father of one of 
our boys was shot by the Gestapo on the street, and 
then, that mome nt I was called by phone, and I rea
lly risked my existence on that date, because 
of course the shelter, it was at
 the back of the house in --  in the cellar, down cellar -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- they had a door hidden by a piece of furniture
 and so on, and there -- so there was an escape 
on -- on another street. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
16 
 
 
A: You see, on the other side. A
nd so all the boys escaped, and I 
took charge of a group of five 
or six, with the Gestapo [indeciph
erable] but I-I was not aware that
 -- I -- I was -- it wa s not an 
heroic action, it was just a purel
y huma n, but in fact, it was. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Because -- and then the priest  fled, disa
ppeared. Hi-His br other was arrest ed, he was 
[indecipherable] and so on, and other people we
re -- are arrested, but none of the boys was 
captured. 

Q: Did the Gestapo know that they were in
 the house, and they came looking for them?  
A: Ah yes, I -- at that time , yes.  

Q: I see. 

A: At that time , yes. 

Q: And was that close to
 the end, or was th -- 
A: It was close to the end of the war, yes,
 of course, and -- and then the boys were 
[indecipherable] and I went to a ma rvelous -- 
well, she was a nun with a very strong character 
and so on and she was in charge of an orphanage
 and so on. And so I took my boys to her and 
that was the end as far as I was concerned, just to
 -- but then after that 
-- if -- should I continue? 
Q: Yes, please, mm-hm. 

A: Yes, yes. So the priest fled, the boys were
 -- disappeared, none of 
them was captured, well -- 
and in September, I think, the -- the place, or  th
e town was liberated by the U.S. first army. And 
then that was a beautiful me mory I have becau
se the Jewish chaplain of the American unit 
invited me  a nd the priest for the celebration of th
e Jewish New Year. I forgot the exact date, but I 
don™t know -- 

Q: In September. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
17 
 
 
A: It was in September, but I don™t r
ecall whether it was the first and so on. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And after that I -- I joined the American 
first army as a volunteer. I-I didn™t accomp lish 
anything. But then we crossed the Rhine, I thi
nk April first at Re ma gen, and then we raced 

through Germany -- not me , but the -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- Patton, and so on, and -- and so finally we
 -- we arrived in the vicinity of We i mar . 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Right?  And then I wa -- I visited, must have
 been I don™t know how 
many days, let™s say 10, 
after the liber ation of the 
camp, of the -- Buchenwald. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And there -- if you want I could talk
 to you about that 
experience, and -- 
Q: Yes, of course. 
A: What? 
Q: Yes, please.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: I™ll have more questions about the ci -- 

A: Why don™t you ask them now?  

Q: Okay?  

A: No?  Would you now? 

Q: Okay, then we can back up a little bit. 

A: Yes? 

Q: When you were talking about when the 
Gestapo started to hunt for these boys -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
18 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- that were in the house, you me ntioned th
at one boy had his -- had his father shot -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- close by. Can you tell us a li
ttle bit about those circumstan
ces, and how is it the connection 
was established? How is it that 
the Gestapo knew that the father 
had a son there, or did they? 
A: No, because then we -- first of all, we knew,
 since the boy were -- a-as far as I recall, you say 
the fa -- the father of that boy was shot a fe
w steps from the house, and so on. But you -- we 
knew that we were in danger, but how the alert wa
s given, that I-I have no recollection of that. I 
just know that at a certain hour 
in the morning, I was called by a 
friend working with that priest 
and so on, that I had to come  at once, and 
then I was put in charge of a group of boys. 

Q: Even mo re to step back, what were the circum
stances of this man™s -- 
how is it that he came  
to be there, that he was -- 

A: Who -- 
Q: -- the -- the father who was shot. 
A: I -- I don™t know, I don™t -- 

Q: Oh, you don™t know. You just kn -- 

A: No, I don™t know. 

Q: Oh, you don™t know that. Okay, so -- 

A: I just know that this happened, and from that mo
me nt of c ourse we were all in mortal danger 
because -- 

Q: Because they could see the -- they could go and look for the boys. 

A: -- a-and the house mu st have been watch and so on, and -- 

Q: Mm-hm. When -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
19 
 
 
A: But it ended in a very sudden way, that all th
e boys fled through the -- that escape door on the 
other si -- on another street, you see, on 
the other side of 
the building, and -- 
Q: Mm-hm. Now, when you would go out and pl
ay with them on Saturdays and Sundays -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- what kind of activitie
s did you undertake with them?  
A: Nor mal, you know, boyish activities and so one, the -- 

Q: What™s that? 

A: Wa lking, first of all. They were happy to
 be out, which was not given, you know, very 
frequently. You must imagine wha t  it is for a b
oy to be shut in a house and so on and then I 
suppose we played ball and that so
rt of thing. It lasted a -- the 
outing lasted about four hours or 
some thing of that sort.  

Q: Would it use -- 

A: In the afternoon. 
Q: Uh-huh. Would it use -- was it in the town, wa
s it in, let™s say outside the town where -- did 
other people see you as you -- 
A: Of course, sure, sure.  

Q: Okay. 

A: But they thought it was a church, nor
ma l church activity, you see, just -- 
Q: I see, so did anybody ever look 
at these children and say they -- 

A: Of course. 

Q: -- they don™t look like our children? 

A: No, no, as far as I know, no. 

Q: Okay, so there was never any -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
20 
 
 
A: A-A-Anyway, I have no i-idea. 
Q: I see, I see. So your outings were not like 
in the woods where no one
 would see them, they 
were within the usual -- 

A: No, no, no, no, I me a n, it was totally open and so on. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was a normal parish activit
y, and -- but I -- as I sa
y, tha-that pr iest  was extremely sensitive 
to any proselyting and so on, and as far as I recal
l, those who -- the boys w
ho had placed in that 
orphanage and so on, actually on Sundays [indeciphera
ble] they went to church, but they were 
given instructions, you see to respect their own 
Jewish practices and liturgies. Although they 
physically participated, they were warned by th
at nun, or by the priests 
themselves, not to do 
anything. And that, I think is a very
 beautiful part of the story.  
Q: Mm-hm. I would a -- how -- can you tell 
me  in total how long, how ma ny years were you 
involved with -- with -- with taking 
care of these boys in that house? 
A: [indecipherable] that was very, 
very short, because he actually
 went into that house, you see, 
in ™41. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then I-I -- I™m not clear, I do not know th
e -- the actually links 
he had with Jewish 
organizations. I don™t even know their name , but th
-they were very active, for instance, they 
supplied food stamps, you see. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And so I suppose that the boys came  to that Jewish --

Q: -- interview with Paul Peeters, conducte
d by Ina Navazelskis on We dnesday, December 22
nd
, 
2004, in Wa shington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side B. So, Mr. Peeters, we were talking 
about the length of time  that the 
boys were in the -- in the hous
e, say -- you know, sheltered by 
the priest -- his name  wa s Joseph Andre, was th
at the n -- his name , yes?  And you we re saying it 
began in 1941, and last ed until almo st theend of German occ upation in Belgium -- 

A: Sure. 

Q: -- in 1944, is that correct? 

A: A-Actually, it was February 1944. That
™s when the incident we recall -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- took place. 

Q: With the fa -- with the ma n being shot? 

A: That™s it. 

Q: I see. So the -- 
A: We ll, that™s my recollection, of course. 
Q: I see. And so then, it was soon afte
r that that -- that the liberation came? 
A: In September. 

Q: In September, yes. Well [indecipherable] yes? 

A: [indecipherable] the war lasted until Ma y 8, 1945. 

Q: And you were with the you -- th
e army, the United States Ar my? 
A: Yes, I was, in We i ma r . 

Q: Okay. So tell me  a little bit more about when you went to Buchenwald. 

A: And then, I don™t know how, I don -- I forgot how
 it took place, why it -- but it was a very 
short period I told you, aba -- af-a
fter the liberation of the cam
p. What I would like to supply, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
22 
 
 
because you know the -- the good Germans were aske
d to surrender their cameras and so on to 
the -- and so I got hold, I don™t know 
how, of a -- a very small photo ca -- 
Q: Of a -- of a photo came ra? 
A: Yeah. And so I took pictures, a
nd those pictures I will -- I have
 to look for them, but I would 
like to supply to you, because as far as I know, I™
m the only one who took the picture bec -- well, 
t hat™s a -- I -- I -- 

Q: Tell us, tell us, mm-hm. 

A: No, I have to tell you the story, because -- 

Q: Sure. 

A: -- the first thing I -- we were greeted, 
the camp of Buchenwald was governed by Yugoslav 
communists. And so those communists were totall
y in control of the camp when we -- we came . 
And so when, I don™t know how, I 
-- I won™t call it a privilege, but
 yet it is some thing important 
for me . I was taken by a team of thos e 
com -- so it™s a first experience --  
Q: The for -- the communist -- forme r  communist prisoners in the camp? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That was first experience of communism, becau
se th-there was such a contrast , you see, 
between those starving inma tes and those, you 
know, powerful and -- Yugoslav communists. So 

anyway, I don™t know -- I don™t know how I ma na
ged, perhaps because I could still already 
speak some English, I don™t know. But I got an ex
traordinary experience, because there -- the 
ma n who guided me  [indecipherable]
 took me really at the -- at th
e center where they -- they 
were exterminated. It was a barrac
k, right, and there was a little yard
 with a gallows, is that what 
you call it, right?  Where they could hang about 15 pe
ople at a time, that -- so the barrack -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
23 
 
 
barrack was here and then there was a doctor™
s office where the shot, you know, were given to 
the inma tes, and then there was a -- it™s horribl
e -- a place where the bodies were just piled, and 
so on, and then the crema tion oven wa s nearby. So th
at ma n took me  there, and of course that™s 
some thing [indecipherable] terrible, I mean 
not -- although, I mean I™ m more impressed by it 
now than I was when I [indecipherable] Jewswith that, you know, i mma ture me ntality I had. 
Q: Why do you say that, why do you 
think it?  Why was it imma ture? 
A: Because I said -- I proved it, 
I said, that I am more moved now by what I experienced then, 
than I was at the time . But I -- and -- and you have
 to -- i-it was an extrao
rdinary experience, this 
-- as far as I recall, that the 
oven were still used in the -- 
Q: Even -- even then? After -- 

A: E -- e -- a -- a -- th-that™s if -- that the 
-- the me mory I have, but I admit it mi ght be wrong. 
Q: Did you still see -- we re there still bodies when you went to see it? 

A: I™m not sure about what my me mory is. My feeling is that they were still used. 
Q: I see. 
A: Perhaps to dispose of -- because the peopl
e were still dying, 
you know, and -- and the good 
American soldiers gave them chocolate and so on,
 which was --  it was tota
lly uncontrolled at that 
time. When I-I -- when I visited the ca
mp where the [indecipherable] was --  
Q: Was this in -- 

A: Because the American ri -- you know, rush -- you have no idea how fast it went . Pa tton, you 

know, ma de  a -- a breakthrough at Re ma gen, and so on, and in a ma tter of days we traveled 

hundreds of miles, and so on. And so there was no, as far as I™m -- as I can say, no effective, 

probably, me dical -- Americans are very, very ni
ce, very kind and so on, but it was some thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
24 
 
 
totally uncontrolled. And so the --  the in -- 
the prisoners died, scores of them died 
[indecipherable] 
Q: How long were you there in
 that area?  How long were you in this We imer area? 
A: I don™t know [indecipherable] it was si -- oh 
yeah, and then I come  to the point which I 
wanted to make. Wa  -- I took a picture -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- which I still have, of that gallows. 
And I™m not sure you ha
ve it, and so on -- 
Q: We ™d very much be honored. 
We ™d be very honored, yes. 
A: No, I tried -- I tried to -- it™s a very poor
 first shot, you know what I™m saying, but yet, I 
would be very happy to -- to send it here -- 

Q: I thi -- the museum 
would be very honored. 
A: -- so it would not be lost, and so on. 

Q: Yes. We  will follow up with this. We  can talk about it later, of
 how to -- how to help acquire 
the picture, what is the pr oper procedure fo
r sending. We will -- we will help with that. 
A: [indecipherable] I 
would be glad -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because my children are simply
 -- know nothing about those things. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you say you were in -- in Buchen
wald for a very, very short time , only -- 
A: No, I -- in the camp itself. 

Q: In the camp itself.  

A: Especially in that area. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Which I -- I-I don™t think that it re
ma ined open for a long time after my -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
25 
 
 
Q: The camera that you found, that you said you ha -- do you 
still have that came ra? 
A: No, of course not. 
Q: No, no. That™s long gone. 

A: One of the box cameras, you know, very -- the ch
eapest of the cheap. But yet, that picture 
came out, and as far as I know, I hope I™ll find it
, but if I do find it, 
I -- I™ll send it to you. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I™ll be very happy to do that -- to do so.  

Q: Wa s it that you were numb?  Whe n you saw this
 -- you say you appreciate it more now than 
then. 

A: Of course. 

Q: Many people were numb when they saw such things, they couldn™t imagine -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- such horror. 
A: No. 
Q: They were -- they were completely shocked.  

A: Yeah.  

Q: So, was that some thing that -- 
also that -- that you could s -- 
A: No, I don™t think I was shocked. Fi rst of all, 
because I could not -- you s
ee, it took me  years, 
so to speak, to realize 
the -- the vastness of this
 operation and so on. It™s 
not that I was not moved 
and so on, I was very sensitive, but -- but I was a r
eal -- that I could testif
y, a real attachme nt to 
the-- to the boys and admi ration to the way, you know
, they acted and so on. I reme mber a little 
Polish boy, I don™t know how he did it, but he wa s reading phil-philos
ophical books, you know. 
He was reading Rousseau and th
at sort of thing and yes -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
26 
 
 
Q: Do you -- 
A: And then -- 

Q: Mm-hm?  Please? 

A: But you have to know that that priest, Joseph 
Andre, after the war was asked to testify and so 
on and to go to Israel, the -- 
the state of Israel was estab
lished if I am correct, in ™48 
[indecipherable] is that what it 
is?  So actually he went to -- to
 Israel, to Yad Vashem, you know, 
only in September 1967. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that™s whe-when he received that t
itle, and planted a tree, and so on, and -- 
Q: The Righteous. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The -- yeah, mm-hm. 

A: And actually Yad Vashem send me  a couple of
 interviews and so on which I could send you -
- to you. In French, unfortunately.  

Q: Mm-hm. That will be fi ne. 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: So y -- a-and you said Yad Vashem sent you interviews -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- done with him, or -- 

A: I don™t know, I -- that I coul d not te
ll, but the document will s -- will tell you. 
Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
27 
 
 
A: Will answer your question, but I too -- Yad Vash
em send me  two or three articles on Joseph 
Andre, after he received that t
itle and so on, then he was received a -- you kn -- in Jerusalem, I 
think. 
Q: Did you ever meet any of the boys again? 

A: No, I -- that™s another story which is very sad. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because after that, in ™68, was the United 
Jewish Appeal ha d him come in America -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and then there was a re
union of -- of the boys, it™s f
unny, I don™t know how they learned 
about the reunion and that I mi ssed, and 
I -- and that I don™t forgive myself.  
Q: Uh-huh. And did -- but did you -- 

A: But perhaps you -- you ma y have a few na me s [indecipherable] 

Q: It™s possible, it™s possible. We  can look in --
 in our archives to see in Namur what kind of 
activities were going on. 

A: Oh, oh yes 

Q: So it™s -- I -- I would -- 

A: So you would have name s, yes?  

Q: Yeah, it™s possible, it™s possible. But you kept
 in touch with the priest after the war? 
A: No, tha-that™s another mi stake I ma de, why --and actually it™s only ve
ry recently, it™s a few 

weeks ago, but I me t that other priest who knew him.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And if you had told me  that you wa nted to ma ke
 that -- this interview, I would have been able 
-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
28 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- to get more material, 
but -- but ac -- I-I -- what I neve
r understood is that, you know, I -- 
how little Europeans, and the Belgians in partic ul ar di d. Because, you know that priest? There™s 

not even one article of biography on him, nothi
ng, although he is known i-in America, and in 
Israel, of course. 

Q: What do you ho -- 

A: There was no -- no official -- no -- no responsib
le ska -- wr itten -- carefully written biography 
of hi m.  

Q: What do you put that down to?  Why? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Why is that? 

A: I don™t know, I don™t know. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: You know, it™s a European. Old Europe, I suppos
e. And that™s why I -- I mean, I always 
dreamt of a -- you know, of Holocaust, you know, 
becomi ng a sort of light. But there is 
some thing mi ssing, there is a mi ssing link and so 
on, and -- of course you -- you gather ma terial 
and so on, but it never became the light you see, a
nd -- and there there is an enormous amount of 
work that should be done. 

Q: In Belgium?  

A: No, in here -- 

Q: Here?  

A: -- in everything, in th
e world in general.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
29 
 
 
Q: Could you explain a little bit more, because
 ma ny peopl e would say that that has happened 
already, that the Holocaust is being used as a -- as
 a -- as an example to teach others not to have 
it happen again. 
A: There I di sagree with you because that™s not
 enough. Because that sacrifice, you see, that 
should not -- no longer, no -- I mean to -- to ma ke the aura, you know. Knowing is some thing 

very important. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Why that -- to transfor m that sacrifice of 
a whole nation into a -- a hope, a light . You will 
agree? 

Q: Oh, of -- of course I agree. I agree. 

A: Especially for the Jewish youth, and so on. And 
-- and there I see that there is work to do, but 
I™m too old to -- for doing.  

Q: What do you think would be ne -- 
what do you think is still needed? 
A: Three things. First of all, you 
have to connect right -- no, because 
for me, for me  is -- is not at 
all -- is no longer -- is not someth
ing -- I™m not centering on the horror of the thing. I see that as a 
-- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and 
recently I got to understand much 
better the universality of the 
Jewish faith, if I ma y use  that word. I don™t whethe r I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because 

the thing is that the root of we
stern culture, although it™s called Jude
o-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the 
first root is the -- the col -- the 
vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me  it™s 
an -- wi -- although I™m a -- a ca -- believer Catho
lic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me  
it™s absolutely fundamental. And 
I see it -- I would not say that in a Je wish way, but for me  I-I 

see the origin of my own Catholic faith here, righ
t in that extraordinar y hi
story of Israel and so 
on. No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of 
all there™s still a tremendous amount of i gnorance. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
30 
 
 
Why -- I don™t see why, in every Catholic school, or
 in every public school there should not be a 
-- some -- a booklet or something, a 
very short, well written, edu
cative infor mation on the Jewish 
customs and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs 
and so on. It could be done at a very little 
expense. Why -- di -- that™s 
one thing, and the second thing 
is that you know the west? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi 
-- and now the values, the traditiona l va lues, 
which we call Judean-Christian values are now 
deconstructed and so on. 
And there there is a 
tremendous work to do. I™m not negative, and I th
ink that in that -- wh
at I call that cultural 
revolution, wi -- there is something which could 
be transforme d into a positive [indecipherable] 
the values of the western cultu
re a-are changed. The change ha s been very negative and so on, 
but it -- it™s also, you see, very -- 
i-it could be transfor me d into a 
positive -- and ther
e I see if the 
Jewish -- if there could be a co
mmon for mulation. Not that the 
Jews really should -- to express 
that basic fundame ntal reality, the universality 
of the Jewish me ssage and so on. But that should 
not be done, you know, by grade, or I don™t know, 
or books and so on. It should be done -- it 
should come  bottom up, you see?  And that could 
be done. That -- that -- that could be done, 
because I™m sure that, first of a
ll that there would be a communi
on of -- of the jewi -- because I 
am -- been a teacher all my life, you see and 
I™m orient ed towards the -- the younger generation, 
I feel more at ease with -- but if that effo
rt could come  bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you 
know, networking. Of course, there is
 an intellectual work which has to be done. And that me ans 
educational work. But the reality should be frie
ndship, should be personal counters, and start, 
you know, very low profile, not, you know, those bi
g reunions. For instance, my daughter me t 
David Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him?  

Q: Mm- mm, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
31 
 
 
A: No, but anyway, he™s a very outstanding pe
rson, but you know, now he
™s totally identified 
with those groups in [indecipherable] and go to Rome  and so on, and you know they captured 
him and so on, and that aspect of personal 
encounter, friendship, mutual understanding, 
cooperation where cooperation is possible, that
 is what is lacki
ng, in my judgment. 
Q: That™s number two. 

A: Number two?  [indecipherable] 

Q: That™s number two, you said there were three things? 

A: No, number one is to for mul
ate, if possible -- first of a
ll to understand why 
the structural 
fra mework of that deconstruction, wh
ich has now been established -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and which threatens the basic Jewish faith 
and tradition and questions
 and so on, as they do 
for the Christian and so on. And 
so there is a commonality, because 
the origin of Christianity are 
Jewish, right? 
Q: That™s right, mm-hm. 
A: Yes. And the basic -- my fait
h, the Catholic faith is based on 
the Bible, and -- which is Jewish 
experience. So, in other word, numb er one is
 understanding of the 
-- of the struct ure -- 
intellectual structure of a decons
truction wh-which si -- is contra
ry to the fundame ntal Jewish 
tradition which, insofa r is it is common to the 
Christian origin. Right?  Number two i-is, if 
possible, try to be more interactive, or more 
intelligent in spreading 
basic knowledge, even for 
kids and so on. 

Q: I see, mm-hm.  

A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upp
er level even more, of 
Judaism, right?  And third 
is that fred -- friendship business.

Q: The context. 
A: You know, [indecipherable] 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: By internetworking, by -- 

Q: Did you -- here is an irony. Sin
ce we didn™t speak much be fore th
e interview, I ha
d very little 
information. But of the little that I had, our -- ou
r, you know, contact who told
 us of you said that 
you hadn™t spoken much about your expe
rience during the war, that -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- okay. Did you tell your own children? 

A: I™m sorry? 

Q: Did you te -- did you tell your own children -- 

A: No -- 

Q: -- did you tell your own fa mily? 
A: [i ndecipherable] little, very little.  
Q: And is there a reason for that?  Wa s 
that a conscious decision on your part? 
A: No, no, there was no reason, I was just -- 

Q: Did they know -- 

A: -- too bashful to push myself forward, that™s
 about it, though. You know
, they know about it, 
and -- 

Q: Then -- 

A: Because in addition to that expe rience with
 the priest, you know, I al
ways thought about -- 
Q: Mm-h m.

A: -- I was connected with a -- though that was a 
very deep friendship and so on, and also with 
my wife, of a French politician name d Mi
chelait I don™t know whether you know his name . 
Q: No, his name  is not known to me . 
A: Anyway, he saved many, ma ny J e ws and so on, a
nd he was a gr -- a great friend of mi ne, and 
he became mi nister, he was a friend of de Gaulle
. He went to Dachau and se -- and so on, but in 
Dachau he -- he worked -- I mean, he did not
 work, but his association was more with the 
communists inmates than with the -- the Jewish 
people. But he saved, for instance, ma ny Jewish 
friends I -- I have who I met here in America, just
 -- so that experience is 
a little bit divided, but I 
was a -- I wa -- never reluctant to speak about it and 
so on, it™s because my role, first of all, what 
I could do, except in that exceptiona
l situation where I re
ally risked my life for them, but I never 
thought I was doing muc h and so on. It™s only afte
r the war, after the business Buchenwald that 
I-I realized the magnitude of the -- of the Holocaust. 

Q: I read a little bit about 
the Holocaust in Belgium. 
A: Yes? 

Q: And comparatively to, let™s say the Netherlands, th
ere were in -- in the articles that I read, it 
was stated that more people were
 involved in hiding and saving Jews
, that f-fewer Jews died. St-
still many, many --  

A: Mm. Yes. 

Q: -- over half were killed, but the per
centages were lower in -- in Belgium -- 
A: Really? 

Q: -- than in the Nether lands. 

A: Mm-h m.

Q: And in some  of the other su
rrounding countries and that there 
were a number of factors that 
contributed to that. Is that some th
ing that you found also to be -- 
A: No, I am not aware of that at all, just -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- no. But I am aware of the number of 
people who performe d, you know, heroic action 
around that -- that system, that little system
 we -- I was a-associ
ated with. I mean -- 
Q: Wa s your fa mily -- did your fa mily know wha t  you were doing? 

A: No, no, no, not the family, not the -- none of the fa mily. The people around , for instance, 

there -- you know, there was a -- a bakery and --
 a bakery that supplied bread, you know, as a 
[indecipherable] and so on, and -- and that woma
n really was heroic, heroic. She was leaving 
[indecipherable] not very far from the center. A
nd that sort of thing, a p-place to a-avoid the 
fa mily, and so on. 

Q: Your fa mily -- 
A: And go through the -- 
Q: -- your -- 

A: -- not my fa mily. 

Q: -- no, but -- 

A: Yeah, [indecipherable]  

Q: -- did they know wha t  you were doing? 

A: They -- no, of course not. 

Q: Okay, so neither your parents, no
r your brothers or
 your sisters -- 
A: No, no, of course not. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0492  
35 
 
 
A: And that was entirely an un 
-- individual decision and so on. 
Q: Did you speak of -- 
A: But I do not mean to say that -- no, I -- I was 
[indecipherable] or that 
sort of thing. I ju-just 
accepted -- I did not even consciously accepted the 
risk. I did it as a service for the -- the 
children, the boys we had, and -- 

Q: Do you reme mber their name s, any of the name s of the boys? 

A: No, no, no.  

Q: No?  

A: We  actually never 
knew them, and -- 
Q: Bless you. Did yo -- did they stay for just a cer
tain period of this time in this house and then 

move on?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: We re there always differe
nt boys that were comi ng?  
A: No -- oh yes. Yes, yes, but that was, I think 
-- I believed at the time that [indecipherable] it 
was some  Je wish organization taking care of 
that circulation and moving the boys and so on. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they were very effective, as proved, as
 I said, by the coupon -- or
 they probably printed 
them, or I don™t know, stole them, or -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But we received whol e sheets, you know, of - -  of -- 

Q: Of those ration tickets? 

A: Yeah, the ration tickets.

Q: Can you tell me  a little bit more, I wasn™t ve
ry clear about the French connection, this ma n 
who you said was a mi nister under de Gaulle an
d had spent time  in Dacha u. Wa s your contact 
with him aft e r the war, or during the war? 

A: No, it was mostly after the war, because during the war he actually was the mayor of this 

town in southern France, the mi ddle of France,
 and he printed, you know, identification paper -- 

i-identity papers and so on, and 
-- and saved, actually saved them. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But he was captured fe -- I forgot  what
 it was, but I think it was fairly early. 
Q: I see, I see. Is there anything else 
from your notes that you would like to -- 
A: No, as far as I know, let me  see. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: To -- a -- a -- I reme mber -- I-I recall 
that it -- the priest  came  in ™68 -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Invited by the Jewish
 appeal in New York. 
Q: What was his last name
?  Wa s -- you said that -- 
A: Andre, Andre. 
Q: Andre?  I thought that
 was like a mi ddle name . 
A: No, no, no -- 

Q: No, no, that was his last name? 

A: Andre [indecipherable] 

Q: Okay. 

A: Actually I think I would like 
to show you, because for -- for 50 
years I cut out from a letter, 
his signature.

Q: Oh my. Oh my, that™s th
e signatur e of the priest. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Wo w.  

A: And that also I could -- 

Q: Donate. 

A: -- but I don™t know, it will be lost, I don™t know if -- 

Q: We  have -- I would talk to -- be
fore you do that, we mi ght ma ke a photocopy. 
A: Yes? 

Q: And I will just talk about the photocopy with 
-- with our archivists, of how this coul d be 
preserve d, how this could come  in 
as a donation. I will 
-- we will see -- 
A: But in the lectures I -- 
when I speak about this -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- you see, and the surface is very small. H-
He was a man living in extreme -- under extreme 
condition, and therefore positive words, [indeciph
erable] gratitude, I don™t know, peace and so 
on. So you would like to ma ke a photocopy of it?   

Q: Yes, at the end of our interview we™ll do that
. Was this letter -- was 
this written to you after 
the war, where you have this signature, the -- 

A: No, no, that was -- he wrote me  during the war,
 but I cut it out and I ha
ve carried it in my 
wallet for more than 50 years. Impressive, no? 

Q: Yes, very impressive, very impressive
. What ever happened to him, aft e r ™66? 

A: No, the last thing I would like to me ntion -- 

Q: Mm-h m?  

A: -- is that when he was buried --

Q: Mm-h m.

the Kaddish or whatever it is, the -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Which is, I think, very touching. 

Q: And he was buried in Na mur? 

A: I suppose so, yes. 

Q: I see. I see. Is there an
ything else you™d like to add to
 what we have spoken about? 
A: I don™t know, I™m at -- entirely at your servic
e. I-I -- I don™t see, no. I think we are about at 
the end of what I have to say.
