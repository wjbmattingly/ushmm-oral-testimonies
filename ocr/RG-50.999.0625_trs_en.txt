W ebegin with this portrait of  Josianne Aizenberg walking on a street in Brussels.
 
Josie was born March21,1939, in Brussels,Belgium , to Jacques and Fanny Aizenberg. The 

arrow on this mapof  Belgium points to Brussels.
 
 
T he Germ an Arm y conquered andoccupiedBelgium  in May
 
1940. Shortly bef ore 
theoccupation, Josie's father lef t Belgium to join the BritishArm y. In this photo we see Josie 

with her pare
n t s in  B russe ls.
 
 
In 1942, Josie'sm other, Fanny, was able to secure a hiding placefor Josie in a 
convent inBrugges, Belgium. Here we see Josie and Fanny, shortly before Josie went into 

hiding. Soon thereaf ter, Fanny, who worked with the Belgian Underground, the resistance, was 

denouncedand she was deported to Auschwitz.

Af ter six m onthsof  hiding in the conventandgro wing Na zi suspicion, the Belgian 
Underground relocated Josie to hide with theDebrackalaers, a Christianfamily in Brussels. 
Here we see
 
Josie wit h the Debrackalaers Mr. and Mrs. Debrackalaer are on the right. T o their 
left areneighbors of  Josie's grandparents.Their grandson is in thef ront in the m iddle with 

Josie to the right.T heDebrackalaer's daughter is on the lef t.
 
 
Allied Forces liberatedBelgium  inSeptem ber, 1944. Soon after, Josie was found by 
oneof her aunts, who was one of Fanny's sis ters. Here we see Josie, Jacques, and Fanny 

af ter they were reunited in Belgium .
 
 
Josie would eventually m arry FreddieT raum ,also a Holocaust 
survivor. W e close 
with this wedding portrait of  Josieand Freddie.

m  and she m oved to 
Israel where they lived forf ive years.W hile inIsrael, theT raum 's son, Michael,and daughter, 

Yael, were born.
 
     
 
Upon theadvice of m edical experts in Israel, theT raum s re
-
located to the United 
States in 1963 to obtain medical caref ortheir disabled son, Michael.
 
Their third child, 
Jonathan, who also isdisabled, was born in the U.S. Eventually, Fr eddie's work brought them 

to Vienna, Virginia.

W ith that, I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our 
F i rs t  Pers o n
, Josie T raum . 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Hi.  I m a de  it .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Josie,thank you som uch for joining us today and being willin g to beour 
F i rs t  
Person
. And in two weeks we'll have Freddieas our 
Firs t  Pe rs o n
 
aswe close outour program.
 
 
W ehave, as you know, a short tim e, so we'll start right away. Your parents, Fanny 
and Jacques Aizenberg, were m arried in early 1938 and you were born in March1939, just 

m onths before Germ an
y and Russia invaded Poland to startW orldW ar II. Before we turnto 

the war and the Holocaust, tell usabout your parents, yourf am ily, what their life was like 

bef ore the war began.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell, m y parents
 
--
 
please excuse m y throat. My parents were really 
newl yweds. They bothhad prof essions they, I think,enteredm arriage and wanted tohavea 

good lif e. 
 
 
In Belgium , the Jews assim ilated quite well. Their relationship with their neighbors 
and with everyone, and with theirf am ilies, seem ed to be
 
very, ver y good. And,of  course, they 

 
3
 
really didn't know of  the impending doom that would happen very, very soon.
 
 
My m other was a dressm aker. She had gone to a special textile vocational school. 
Andapparently when they graduated, the royalf am ily in Bel
gium  would com e and pick out a 
few students to work at the Royal Household.Som y m other was actually working f or the r
o ya l  
household.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hichwas a huge honor.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
It was a big deal. My m om was thrilled.She really was. I m ean, s
he was a 
young personand justworking f or the royalf am ily was really som ething very special.
 
 
My dad was a tailor.W e had a shop.W e lived in afour
-
story apartment building. W e 
lived on the bottom f loor. And part of the bottom f loor there was a store, a
 
tailoring store which 
m y dad ran. And in those days you couldn't just go and buy a suit ready
-
m ade. My f ather had 
lots of boltsof m aterial. Soa person would com e in, choose the material they wantedfor asuit, 
andthenm y dad would makea pattern andm easurehim andf it him . You know, making a suit 

for som eone wasn't just a 
s hor t
 
deal.
 
It took weeks and weeks. The custom er would keep 
com ing back being m easuredandf itted.Som y dad was a tailor and m y mom  was in the 

dressmaking business.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beinga tailor, though, was not yourf ather'sf irst occupation. You know I'm 
going to ask you to tellus that.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yes. My dad
 
--
 
believe it ornot, in the 
`
20s and 
`
30s, the m ovies
 
--
 
they had 
silent movies. There were not talkies sobecause of that, in Europe,or in Belgium, anyhow,  

differentm ovie houses hired quartets, violin,cello
, 
viola,f or people to play while thef ilm was 
showing. So m y dad was a violin player. Andwhen thetalkies camein the late 
`
30s, m y dad 
lo s t  h is  job .
 
So  
--
 
in  f
act, all them usicians lost their jobs. So m y dadwent to tailoring school, 
becam ea tailor. So that was really his second profession.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I just love having you tell us that.
 
 
Your parents were m arried in 1938. Nazi power in Germ any and Austri
a took an 
even m ore om inous turn, also in 1938, with Kristallnacht or Night of BrokenGlass in late 

Novem ber. You were born March 1939, just months before Germany and Russia invaded 

Poland to begin the war. Given thepolitical circum stances and the rise of
 
Nazism , did 
you 
learn later, did you know if for your parents
 
--
 
how do you in them idst of  that environment
 
--
 
was that som ething that was ver y worrisom e to them? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
You know, I im agine it was. Of course I don't recall them  talking about it
 
because I was so young. But Ithinkthey were ver y concerned.T hey were very wor ried. They 

would listen tothe radio continuously, m ainly to the BBC
, t
o hear what was going on in the 
world. It was scary. I think they were worr ied how f ar Germans would com e in Europe, how far 

to the west. So I think it was ver y worr isom e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In lateNovem ber, Kristallnacht, Night of Broken Glass, when all over Germany 
andAustria, partsof  Czechoslovakia, I believe, there was a horrif icfight of  violence and 

va
ndalism  against Jews and against 
t
heir businesses. Your parents,soonaf ter that, I think 
they took in a childf ora period of time.T ellus what you know about that.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Asfar as I know, m y m om
 
--
 
m y parents
 
--
 
actually, m y dadhad already le
ft. 
My m om  took ina Jewish child that had beencaught where Kristallnacht, where theGermans 

were. So m y grandparents,actually, andm y m other took in this little girl to stay with us until 

shefound a saf erplace with som ef am ily.
 
It was ver y worrisom e f
or Jews. Jews were tr yi ng to 
get away f rom  where the Germ ans hadalready invaded. So it was very, very worrisom e and 

ve r y s c a r y.

>> Bill Benson:
 
And, of course,a year or so later in May
 
1940, eight m onths af ter Germany 
attacked 
Poland, they invaded what we call the low countries, Belgium , the Netherlandsand 
France. Yourfather lef t to join the British Army just bef orethe Germans launched their 
invasion. Tell us whatyour f atherdid and then what thatm eantfor your mother andfor you.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Su r
e.As Im entioned,m y parents would listen tothe radioall the time.They 
heard callsf rom  Britain asking people to volunteer to join theBritish Army. My dad, actually 

andhis brother,both decided that they would volunteer and try and get to Britainto 
j o i n t he 

B rit is h  
Arm y. Both of them  were tailors. My uncle, m y dad's brother, was also a tailor.And they 
both decidedtoactually go to England.They lef t Belgium . My dad left when I was 13m onths 

old. And they got toEngland, which was ver y,  ver y dangero
us at the tim e because the
 
G
erm ans 
w
ere actually torpedoing boats crossing the channel. 
 
 
Som y daddid get to England. Andthe British governm entor Arm y decided, 
W
h a t 
could they do with these two guys? T hey wer e both tailors. And what they did isthey pu
t the m  
in afactory m aking British uniform sfor the Arm y
, w
hich was thebest place m y dad could be. 
S
o but he did leave. And m y m om  and I andm y m aternal grandparents,m y m om 's parents, we 
all stayed together.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A nd  in  li
ght of a currentf ilm
,  "Du n k irk
" 
--
 
I was thinking about you asthisf ilm  
cam e out because your father lef tf rom  Dunkirk and I think he left ononeof  the last ships that 

got outbefore the Germ ans arrived.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yes.He did.Actually, he got toEnglandand m y mom never knew whether he 
actually got there or not. Because there was no com municationat all.W ar hadalready started.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soonce he lef t
 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T hatwas it. Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So what
 
--
 
to your knowledge, what did yourm otherdo now? You're 13m onths 
old, it's just the two of you plus your grandparents.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,things were ver y lim ited asfar asfood was concerned, care. My m other 
alwa ys used to tellm e that in Belgium andm any other countries in Europe they have spec
ia l  
places where you takenewborns and you getcare, imm unizations and all kinds of caref rom  

thedoctors. And oncethe war started, that really stopped. So m y mom  in a way
 
--
 
it's not that 
she was stuck with me but shedidn't really have any outside service that she could use. And 

she was with her parents, who were livin g wit h us.And we were pretty m uch to ourselves.
 
 
At that tim e, also, the Germ ans, whenthey invaded,everybody had to carry an 
identity card.And in itactually stated if  you were Jewish or not. Andyou hadto carry that card 

wherever you went, on the streets
. A
nd,of  course, you could be stopped at any time by a 
Germ an.T hey would say
 
gi ve m e your identity card
 a
nd youhad togi ve it
 a
nd they decided 
what they would do.
 
So I thinkm y m om  and I, and m y grandparents, were in a very precari ous 
position.T hings were very lim ited. And we kind of  relied on ourselves.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you would remain inthose circum stances, under Nazi occupation, until 
1942, which is when your mother made the really profound decision to place you into hiding. 

T ell us about the events that ledupto yourmother'sdecisiontohave you hiddenbut also 

during that period of tim e, two years, really, that you were existing in the circum stances you 

described
. W
hat was
 
your life like?W hat was lif e likef or yourm om during that time? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,m y m om , actually, she was part of  theunderground.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Part of  the resistance?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Part of  the resistance. She would deliver leaflets for m eet
ings that the 
underground
 
--
 
where they were m eeting. She would also take in Jews who would f leef rom  

 
5
 
countries where theGerm ans had already invaded. So we ver y of ten had people sleepingat 
our houseuntil they would go to another safe place.
 
 
Because m y
 
m other was partof the underground, she kindof  had
 
--
 
there was a 
whole network. And she was able to get someone to pickm eup,two wom entopick me up 

andput me into hiding.
 
 
Now, to m e, that's probably oneof thehardest decisions I think that she cou
ld have 
m ade.W hen they puta child in hiding, they weren't able to tell theparents where they were 

being placed becausethey knew when the Germ ans would com eto your apartm ent to see 

who was there or totry to arrest you, they wo uld say where's rest of your f am ily, where are 

your children, where's your husband,and they would torture youuntil they got it out of  you. So 

they decided,theunderground, when they wo uld take children andput them in hiding, they 

would not tell the parents where they were being placed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So your m other doesn't know anything about her husband.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
No .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather. Now you're gone. She knows nothing about you.
 
 
Bef ore we com e back to your tim e in hiding, a couple of other things I want to
 a sk 
you about. Youm entionedhaving to carry I.D. cards that said Jew on it. Although you were 

ver y young, you shared with m eaf leeting mem ory you have aboutbeing ona bus with your 

m other bef ore you went into hiding.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yeah.W e kept very m uch to ourselves butonce ina while I did have an 
outing wit
h my mom. On 
one such day, we took abus ride to go
 
--
 
Ican't rem em ber even 
where we went. Butmy m om  and I goton the bus.W edidn't have buses inBelgium.W eused 

tram s, which were electrical
ly
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
E le c t ric a l t ro lle ys .
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T rolleys. So m y m om and I got on the bus.W e saton the last row on thebus, 
all the way at the end. W hile we were riding on this tram , a Germanoff icer came on the tram  

andasked everybody for their I.D. cards.And he went row by row b y row. My mother was 

shaking. Ididn'tunderstand why but this Germ an off icer wentf rom row to row. And he got to 

the last row andhe turnedaroundand he never asked usfor ourI.D., which som ebody was 

looking over on us because it was a pretty close call. My m other stopped shaking. And, of 

course, I never connected it. I didn't realize that she was so af raid of what m ight happen. But I 

was saved then.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And one of the things thatm ight have happened, certainly beginning in 1942, 
were deportations to Auschwitz.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Exactly. T hat's when Belgium  Jews were actually startedtobedeported, in 
1942.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your grandparentsand your great grandparents,tell us what happened to 
t h em  du r i n g 
that time.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,actually,f irst Im ust say I was placed
 
--
 
I was put in hiding.T wo ladies 
cam e to pick m e up
, t
wo strange ladies who Ididn't know. Andas Im entionedbefore
,  
m y 
m other was not allowed to know where I was going. T hey cam e to pick m eup.T hey took me 

to abeautiful little city in Belgium calledBrugges. It was full of  convents.They tookme to this 

convent. My m other,of course,as Imentioned, didn't know where I was going. And they took 

m eto this convent,f ullof nuns. Nunsnotas you see today, dressedin m odern clothing but 

v
er y m uch like thenuns in "T he Sound of Music" , very stif f gear, very stiff .T he nuns werealso 
ver y strict. But they placedm e in hiding, which was wonderful. It was a convent but it was 

 
6
 
m o re  lik e a
n orphanage. People
 
--
 
becausethere was nofood, very littlef ood,and it was 
during war, so peoplewould put their kids ina convent, like an orphanage,and hopethey 
would pick them up when things got easierfor them .So that's 
w
here I actually was.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:
 
That'swhere you were.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
However, in them eantim e,I think I was placed really just in tim ebecause 
soonaf ter thatm y m om  andher parents wer e deported.They were  actually arrested, 

deported, and taken to Auschwitz.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:
 
And inyour m other's case, she was denouncedby som ebody. Somebody told 
on her, inform ed.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
One of  her neighbors. There were m any wonderful people in Belgium . I mean, 
people helped me.I'm here today because ofthem . But there were also many people who got 

m oney f rom  theGermans if  they would tell them  where the Jews were. Soactually our 

neighbor is theone who denouncedm y m om andher parents. Because they were taken to 

A u sch wit z.  

>> Bill Benson:
 
And, of course, we're going to talk moreabout yourm other later. Your 
grandparents perished at Auschwitz.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yes, they did. My grandfather died on oneof  thetrains, getting toAuschwitz. 
Andm y grandm otherand m other were separated as soon as they got to Auschwit z.
 
 
You know, there
 
were selections. Most concentration cam ps, whenyou got there, 
they were killing centers, you got there and they killed you. Auschwitz had a subcam p, a labor 

cam p, where they m ade am munition. AndGerm any was ver y interested in gearing up their 

amm unition 
production for the war. So inAuschwit z they had afactory, Birkenau, which was 
actually a labor cam p.And as soonas you got off the train, there was what they calleda 

selection.T he olderf olks, handicapped, or children would be put inone line and the 
stronger 

people, the younger people likem y m om  whowas in her early 20s, wouldbe putonanother 

lin e .
 
 
So there was a selection, and imm ediately my m om and herm other were separated. 
My m other wanted tobe with her mother, so she went into the line where
 
her mother was and 
the Germanactually hit her andtoldher thatyou go where you're told to go.She actually never 

saw her m other again.Som y grandparents perished very, ver y soon.W ell, my grandfather 

died right on the train and m y grandm other as soon as she gotthere.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So with your m otherat Auschwit z, you're in this convent. And you wouldbe in 
the conventfor about a year. T ellus about what you can about your tim e inthat convent and 

then what ledto thedecision tothenm ove you live
 
with a Christianfam ily. In the comm ent, as 
you said, thenuns looked like"The S
ou n d of  
M
usic"  but they were very, very str ict.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
And they didn't sing.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But they were ver y strict. T o the extent you know, what was your lif e like in that 
convent? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I can't comparetoother convents.I don'tthink I've been in another one. But
 
this a very large courtyard, kind of  insidetheconvent. It was out in the open. And the children 

would really
 
--
 
we woul d all play together.W ewould say our 
R
osaries, m any tim esa day. I 
would say m ine in French. I didn't know what I was saying but I would say my rose Rosaries. 

And we would play.
 
 
Andby the way, I was i n the conventf or,I believe, a littlebit more than six 
m o nth s. 
Andunbeknownst tome, there were three other Jewish children there being hidden.The 

 
7
 
convent wasf ull of  kids butthere were four Jewish kids therebeinghidden.
 
 
You know, in Belgium,probably m ost countries in Europe, if  you were hiding a Jew, 
y
ou were reall y risking your lif e because if the Germansfound you,they would just shoot you 
on the street,no questions asked. They would just shoot you. Sothese nuns,however strict  
they were with m e, they saved m y lif e.
 
 
T he reasonI was m oved out
 
--
 
>
> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou tell us that, while you were in the convent, I think, your name was 
changed.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell uswhat name you were given. And there's some signif icance about that 
name. Right? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell, the n
am e
 
--
 
m y f irst nam e rem ained the sam e because it was a French 
name butm y last name which was I guess aJewish nam e, they changed m y last nam eonm y 

docum ents tom oreof a Flem ish/Dutch name, which was Von Berg.And I had that nam e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A n d  yo
u were in anareathatwas m ore Flem ish?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yeah. Near the Dutch border.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you couldhideeasier, is the notionbehind that.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soasyou said, you were moved to the Debrackalaers
. Y
ou were ab
ou t  to t e l l  
us that.W hat led to the decision to move you to their home?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Apparently thenunsf ound out that theGermans were going to com e, the 
Nazis were going to com e, and pickup thefour Jewish children.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So, again, som ebody probably inf ormedthem .
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yes.And I heard this happened quite afew tim es in Belgium.T he nuns would 
f ind out that the Germ ans were going to come and pick up Jewish children and they would 

alwa ys tell the Germ ans
 
the kids aren't ready ye
t
; l
et us gettheir clothes ready and come back 
tomorrow m orning. And that's what they did.T hey would com eback. But in themeantim e,the 

nunsactually sm uggle d thef our of us outof  the convent andbrought us all to Brussels, which 

is where I was originall y from . And they placed me with a Catholicf am ily, a mother,father,and 

a little girl. AndI stayed with them  really for the duration of the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Until Septem ber
 
1944.
   
****
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W hen Belgium  was liberated. Them an,by the way,  was part of  the 
underground also.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Mr.
 
Debrackalaer.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T heywould ver y of ten t
ake him  out and 
interrogate him atnight, the Nazis. 
He would come back black and blue. Hedidall kinds of things in theunderground, I guess to 

upset whatever the Germ ans were doing. But henever toldonm e. Istayed with them
,  
a s I  
s a id
,  
really for the restof  the duration of the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know how they explained your presence in their hom e? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I hardly went out so
 
there was really no
 
--
 
I don't think there was m uch 
explaining. I didn't go out very m uch. Ididn't see people.
 
 
You know, in Belgium,food was rationed. 
Yo u  w
ould pick up your ration oncea 
week at a special center to however m any people were registered.
 
And they were register ed 
for three people, themother,father,and littlegirl. I was there illegally so they would pick up the 

food once a week butshare it with me. So ina way, they reall y did risk their lives in every wa y. 

W e very m uch kepttoourselves and I really didn't see very m any other people.

>> Bill Benson:
 
Prettym uch stayed indoors during that whole tim e.T ell us, asbest you know, 
what that was likef or you to be not only in their household with their fam ily but really restrict ed 
in term s of not being able to go out. So you're there all the tim e.W hatdo
 
yo u
 
recall of  what 
that was likefor you? A little girl, Josianne, what was that likefor you? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,what I remember, I used toplay with the littlegirl all the tim e.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:
 
Their daughter?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ith their daughter. But I dorem em ber they were very close unit.They we re 
af am ily and however wonderful they were wi thm e,I wasn't partof the unit. AndI guess Ifelt 

th a ta s a little  girl. I d on 't th in k the y
 
m eant tom ake mefeel that way butI didn'tfeel part ofthat 
f a m ily u n it .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Josie,oneof  thethings that you shared with me was they obviously risked 
their lives to protect you. T hey took care of  you.T heyf ed you. Butas you said, they di
dn't hug 
you. T hey didn't kiss you to sleep. Andas a little girl, you f elt that.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I did.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you've been very eloquent
 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
And Ifeel very f ortunate, you know, feel very strongl y, psychologicall y, that 
the f ir
stthree years of  lif e if you bond with som eone, a caregiver that is im portant to you, it 
really establishes a certain well
-
being that carries you throughout lif e. And Ifelt Ihad thatfor 
thef irstthree years of my lif e with m y grandma andm y m other. So
 
al t h o u gh  I m i s s ed i t  l ater  
on, I think I still had the m em oriesof how thatwas.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothat solid grounding in f amily. 
 
 
Belgium  was liberated in 1944, in thef allof  1944.W hen the war endedfor 
B e lgiu m
 
--
 
the war was  still going on elsewhere in Europe
 
--
 
your AuntT heresa was abl
e t o 
f ind you and shebrought
 
you 
t o 
herhom e. How did that happen? For exam ple, no one knew 
where you were because of what youexplained. So how did your auntf ind you and what was it 

like for them totake youf rom  the Debrackalaers to their home? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
My m om had to sisters. My two aunts. Andthey were also hidden throughthe 
underground in churches. So really Belgium  did a lot asfar as saving m any of their Jews 

because m y aunt
 
--
 
the older aunt had three sons,m y three cousins. Andthey were all hidden 
in a church.Butbecause they were part of  the underground, therewas a network andthey 

foundm e.Theyf oundm e at the Debrackalaers and they cam e to pick m eup, which was 

absolutely wonderf ul.They tookm eto their hom e. And I was with them .
 
A nd  m y t h r ee  c ous in s, 
who were just af ew ye ars older than me, they were three brothers.They spoiledm e rotten.It 

was great.T hey treated me like their mascot. It was just wonderf ulbeing with f am ily again. It 

reall
y was. I felt a difference.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You had been in a Catholic convent, an orphanage.You were with a Christian 
fam ily. Now you're back with the Jewishf am ily.W as there any change for you in term s of 

awareness of being Jewish that you hadn'thad up until that point? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W e ll, I ' m
 
--
 
there was. My aunt would light candlesFriday night.W ehad,you 
know, Sabbath dinners. They had many of  the traditions. Although I don't remem ber them  very 

m uch athom e because I left so young. But we didhave som eof  that with m y aunt.It was just 

wonderful being with f am ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Getting that love and affection that you hadm issed.
 
 
You toldm e a story about your uncle who after the war was recognized. T ellus.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yes.My aunt's husband, my uncle, he was a very shy, m eek, man. Af terthe 
war he was actually decorated and honoredfor having been brave and killedmany Nazi 

 
9
 
soldiers. It was unbelievable because this was sucha quiet, shy, m eek man. I think no onein 
the fam ily could bel
ieve it. Buthe was awarded anddecorated, which is really som ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And, of course,during the imm ediateaf term athof  the war in Belgium
 
--
 
and, 
again, this is late summ er/fall of 1944, theBattleof  the Bulge would happen.
 
>> Josie T raum
: 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Belgium  is pretty m uch shattered.W hat was it likefor your aunts tobegin to 
rebuild their lives and you're part of that?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,I think it was ver y hard. In Belgium  they
 
--
 
part of  their apartment, also 
on the ground
 
f loor, they had a store, a leatherwoods store.Soof  course as soon as thewar 
ended,they moved back to their place, opened the store,and life really changedf or them .I 

can't say it was back to norm albut somehow things regained muchm orenormalcy. So 
I thin k 

it was hardf or them .They worked hard, butat leastthey were all together.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Right. In what must have seem ed toeverybody, your m other's sisters, to 
ever ybody it m ust have seem ed likean incrediblem iracle, your mother, Fanny, survi
ved 
Auschwitz. She returned to Brussels af ter her liberation in April of 1945. And then she was 

reunited with her sisters. You were 6.W hat do you recall of your m other sortof  just 

reappearing when probably people thought she was dead? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ye
s. I think we all thought she was dead.W henm y m om  was liberated, she 
was a pretty sick wom an. ShehadT yphus andm eningitis. Sheeventually made her way 

down, with the Red Cross actually, brought her backdown to Belgium . You know, m y m om, 

f irst place she went was her sister's apartm ent. She knocked on thedoor andthere I was.So 

we were reunited. Andm any of the things that I recallf rom  that, I think are things that m y mom  

toldm ebecausem any things I don't remember. Im ean, I was 6 years old. And I really don't 

rem em ber many of  the things. But it was wonderf ul seeing heragain.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soonaf ter she cam ebackand you were reunited she would take you and 
m ove back into what had been her hom e in Juneof 1945. Knowing
 
--
 
I know a lot about your 
m other's
 
--
 
what happenedto yourm other. As you said, shehadbeen not only incredibly si ck 
anddisabled but shehad been through ahorrif ic ordeal. Do you know what it was like f orher 

to  so rt of
 
--
 
and,of  course, she still hasno idea about your father
 
--
 
how she m anaged to both 
take care of you and try to rebuild her life at thatpoint? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Itm ust have been so diff icult. I think she relieda loton her two sisters. And I 
think thefam ily became very, ver y close. And m y m om  kind of relied on whatever services she 

could get. It wasn't until a year later in1947 thatm y dad actually returnedf rom Englandto 

Belgium . But it was hard form y m om  to manage.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And when yourfather cam eback, I think it was 1946, I think,a year af ter
 
the 
wa r .
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout that. Because you remember that.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I do rem ember that. My dad couldn't com e back right after the war because 
theapartm enthe was livin g in, in London
 
--
 
you know, there was so m uch
 
bom bing in London 
during theblitz andeverything else. Thehouse he was li ving in was bom bed.And he spent 

two years in the hospital. Sohe was injured pretty badly.
 
 
So when he did com eback, wheneventually m y m om  andhe would connectand 
write and we knew that he was com ing back, I rem em ber going to the port city of Belgium , 

where the ships com e in,m y m om and I waiting thereand m y dad com ing down the stairs. I, of 

course,didn't know wh o he was butm y m om actually pointed to him and said,"T here'
s  yo
u r 

 
10
 
father."  And I
 
hadno idea who thism an was.You know, it was hardbecause thethree of us 
went through such very different experiences. My m om  went through hell. My dad had a pretty 
hard tim e. And I was just, you know, a child in them iddle.So it was 
hard.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
It washard.W ere they both able to resum etheir work lives at that time? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T heywere. M y dad eventually worked again in hisshop. And we lived in the 
sam e apartment, because it was m y parents'apartm ent building. So we
 
tried to resume lif e as 
m uch as we could. Howe ver, my parentsdecided they really needed to leave Europeandso 

they decided to apply for visas and papers tocom e tothe United States. And we eventually did 

in 1949.W ehad to wait for a num ber of  years fo
r  t he
 
quotas,for ournames to com e up.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothat was it. You had to simply just wait until thenum bers cam eup.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So it would takefour years after the war, three years af ter yourfather came 
b a ck.  

>> J o s i e
 
T r au m :
 
Andm y dadand m y mom and I came to the United Statesalong with his 
brotherand his wif eand two girls. So thetwo fam ilies really cam e tothe UnitedStates 

together.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sohere they com eto the United States. You're10 years old. And
 
no w it's to  
begin a whole new lif e, for each of you.W hatdo you rem em ber about thatfor yourself ?W hat 

was it like at 10 years old to arrive here andbecom eanAmerican? 
 

>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,f irst of all,I spoke no English. T hey 
put m e in
 
f i r s t  gr a d e.
 
I was never 
told to begin with. So,you know, when you measurethe kids
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell uswh y you were put in f irst grade.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Because I knew no English. First grade, you know no English, you don't 
understand
, f
irst grade. The reason I was saying I was never really t all,f irst grade I didn't stand 
out that much. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Th e  d esks.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Right. It tookm e a few days,  af ew weeks to learn a few words of  English. 
And then they putm e in second grade. And so on it wentforaf ew weeks until If inally lef t 

elementary school with m y grade.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soforaf ew weeks you're put intoa new grade.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Exactly. T hething is, now I can't rem em ber not speaking English. Because 
it's becom e sonaturally. But atthe beginningit was ver y
 
--
 
it  wa s  re ally d if f icu lt .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And yourf ather spoke English becausehehad beenin England.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
He did but his English was not that great.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatabout your m other's adjustment?
 
>> J o s i e  T r a
um :
 
My m om  spoke no English and it's interesting because when I cam eback 
home, we spoke French or m y parents spokeYiddish to eachother.And they learned
 
--
 
went 
to night schoolas soon as they cam e tothe UnitedStates.They wanted so much tobecome 

Am e
ricans. So they attended night school.T hey learned English.T hey learnedall the 
c
apitals, 
states, presidents. And when I would com ehom e, they wouldn't speak French tom e.They 

would only speak English because they wanted som uch to learnEnglish.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:
 
You described it at one tim eas they were passionate aggressi ve about 
becom ing Am ericans.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T heywere. Absolutely. They tookthe test. You know
 
--
 
I don't thinkthey have 
thattoday where you r eally have to pass a test.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:
 
They still dof or citizenship. Yup. I don't know if  it's the sam e test but.
 

 
11
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So soon af ter you arrived, though, you had abad incident. You were in New 
Jersey. You were beaten up by
 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Abunch of  kid
s .  A  b un c h  of  gi r l s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A bunch of  girls beat you up.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ill you say a littleabout that?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Actually, I think it was first week I was in school.W henI cam eout of  school, 
at the endof day, when it was f inished, therewas a group of  girls wa iting form e. And they 
actually beat me up. And I had no idea why. My m other went to school the next day, which I 

thought was pretty brave ofher,not speaking ver y m uch English, and she wantedto know 

what 
hadhappened.W hydid they beat meup?And the principal said to her, well, the children 
thought that your daughter was German.I don't know what baring that has to do with it. I don't 

think kidsat that time really differentiated or knew what a German was. But, I wasn't beaten up 

again. So that's good.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That was good, yes. That was good. Josie,did your aunts rem ain
 
--
 
do  t hey 
rem ain in Belgium ?
 

>> Josie T raum :
 
T heydo not. My aunt with her three boys went toIsrael and settledthere
 
wi
th  
he
r three sons. Andmy younger aunt cam e to the United States and lived in New York.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Aboutthe sam e time?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
A little bit later. She waited afew years and got a job, was working.W e were 
pretty close.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know
 
how m any of  your extendedfam ily perishedthroughthe 
Holocaust? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,I would say m y grandparents,they had brothers and sisters. My father, 
oneof his brother's perished, children. Sothere were quite afew people. I'm lucky I'm here.
 
>
> Bill Benson:
 
Absolutely. And later you would m eetanother Holocaust survi vor. T ell usabout 
m eeting Freddie.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Ok. Iwent to Israelfor a year to study. In the 
` 50 s  
--
 
it wasn't that long ago
 
--
 
but in thosedays you didn't travel by plane.
 
Planes were very expe nsive. So
 
you went by ship. 
I  wa s  i n
 
Israelf ora year. I went with a groupof  students. It was really a wonderf ul experience. 
And com ing on the way hom e on the ship,Im et this officer.
 
He was a c
h i ef  
radio off icer on the 
Israeli passenger liner. Andhe was obviously socializing with thepassengers.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Me being oneof them .And we were m arried a year later.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
On the ship.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Onthe ship. The ship was in port. You know, we had the 
band, the food, 
ever ything was there, like a very special place.W ehad our guests.It was just wonderful. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Josie,your m other, Fanny, your husband, Freddie,and youare each 
Holocaust survi vors and arepartof  our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program . Yourm other, Fanny, was wi th 
us to start this 2017 year of
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
in March atage 100.W e lookf orward toher return in 
March 2018 when she's 101. I thinkour audience should know that,and just how extraordinary 

it is that each of you, each of you, continue to speak publicly aboutwhat you experienced. 

W hat is this likef or you to dothis?W hat's it likef or you andfor your fam ily to do this? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Forme, personally, I 
can say that it m akes me f eel good that people are 
interested and wanttoknow what happened.The only way you canreally avoid som e of these 

 
12
 
things happening again is by knowing the history and what did happen. If eel very good, 
especially going to schools I go tom iddle schools, Catholic schools,high schools.It really 

does
 
m akem efeel very good to hear thatpeopleare interested.T hey want to know. They 
really do.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You spoke at m y son's m iddle school. For those kids, it was a profound 
experience.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T hey were lovel y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Josie, we ha
ve tim e to turn to our audiencefor afew questions. Shall we do 
that?
 

>> Josie T raum :
 
S u r e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok.W e have a hand going up already.W e're going to have two m ics, one 
down eachaisle.W e're going to ask you to wait until you have them ic in your hand so that we 

can allhear it.
 
T ry to make your question
 
--
 
we have two I think right upf ront. T ry tom akeyour 
question as brief as you can. I'll do m y best to repeat it just tomakesure we hear it correctly, 

andthen Josie will respond to it.
 
 
I k
now two hands shotup down here. Righthere in the third row, I believe. There we 
go .
 
>>
 
Did you ever reunite with either thenunsor thefam ily that tookcare of you? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question i
s , D
id you ever reunite with either thenunsor thef am il
y th a t 
took care of you? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
Yeah. Thefam ily, the Debrackalaers
 
--
 
m y husband and I were inBelgium  in 
1989, and we triedtofind them , thefam ily. T hey had all died, including the little girl who wa s 

m y age.
 
 
T he nuns,I wrote to the Belgian
 
governm entbecause I really f eel it's im portant to 
get them  recognized, to acknowledge what they did. Theorder isnolonger in existence. And 

f rom  what I understand
,  
what I've been told by other churches, organizations, that when an 
order dim inishes
 
o r p
eopledie, they ver y of ten joinanotherorder. So I have not beenableto 
f ind thenuns.T hat particular order isno longer in existence.
 
>>
 
And do you think thatm aybe a reason they didn't get em otionally attached to you was for 
protection for you and for
 
t h em ? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The follow
-
up question is, Doyou think the reason that they did not get 
attached to youemotionally was a protective thing? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I don't know. T hat I really don't know. You know, it wasn't just with m e.Itwas 
wit h  a ll 
the kids.They were rather strict. Idon't know if that's adem eanor in general of nuns. 

I'm  not really sure.
 
>>
 
[Inaudible] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the Debrackalaers, too.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
T he Debrackalaers, yeah,also.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok. Did we have a questionhere? Maybe not. Ok.
 
 
Do we have another question?W ehave ahand up behind you, Jocelyn. I'm  sorry. 
T hen there'sone behind you as well.
 
>>
 
Do you still speak French or Yiddish? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you still speak Frenchor Yiddish?
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
No
t Yiddish.I never spoke Yiddish.ButI speak French and Hebrew.
 
>>
 
And you and Freddie
,  
what do you speakwith each other? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
E n glis h .  
 

 
13
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, I m ightm ention that Freddie was rescued through what's known as a 
Kindertranspo
rtand ended up in England, sospent many years in England bef ore going on to 
Israel.
 
 
W ehad ahand back there.
 
>>
 
I was just wondering if  there was repercussionsf or thenuns when they cameto getthe 
Jewish children and they weren't there.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:
 
The question is, 
W
hen the nuns would, you know, delay to be able tohidethe 
children, were there repercussionsf or them ? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
You know, thatI never f ound out. But I know thereare many stories and 
essays thatI read inbooks of nunsdoing that. Im ean that'sthe ultim ate risk, you know, telling 

the Germans come back tomorrow, we're not ready with the kids yet. I don't know if the 

Germ ans ever cam eback and didn't see thekids and whether thenuns were punished. I really 

don't know that.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:
 
W hileanybody's thinking about another question
 
--
 
there we go.
 
>>
 
So your m om  was told on by your neighbor. Did your m om  have trust issuesafterthat? 
How did she deal with that? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question is since your mother and your grandparents were denouncedby 
a neighbor, after, later, did your mother have trust issuesaround other peoplebecauseof  

having had thathappen to her? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
W ell,you know, I really don't know thatbecause we did leave Belgium .W e 
le ft E u ro p e. I 
think that in itself  tolda lotbecausem y parents didnot want to remain there,and 

probably because there were trust issues. You know, what if  it happened again?W hat if 

neighbors did som ething again? So I've never spoken about that tom y m om but it'sprobably a 

ver y interesting issue.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I suppose you have no ideawhatever happened tothatneighboreither.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
No. No, I really do not.
 
 
By the way, you know, m y m om , as Bill mentioned, is 100and she volunteers here 
ever y Sunday. She sits at the survi vor desk and talks to whoever wants to listentoher. 
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And it is well worth spendingsom e time, I can tell you that.
 
 
Do we have another question? One right here.T hank you.
 
>>
 
T hat was part of m y question.
 
I was like, oh,m an, 100. I want tom eet her. I can't wait until 
next year.
 
 
W e'rea Catholic youth group here. I was justwondering
 
--
 
we're actually going to 
help some nunsnext week. Have you ever been invited by any other nuns
 
--
 
you said you had 
neve
r been to anothera convent
 
to comparewhat othernuns are like, I guess. I was just like, 
huh. I'm interested also
 
in, like, have you prayed the Rosary since thenor did youever learn 
anything about Catholics versus Jewish? And also do you speak to youth
 
groups other than 
ju st  sch oo ls?  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question is, Do you speak to youth groups? Have you been invitedtogo to 
another convent and speakata convent to see a difference
 
--
 
arrangem ent? 
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I haven't beentoa convent but Ihave beento quiteaf ew Catholic schools. 
I've been in Maryland, in Virginia, tom any of them.T hey're ver y, ver y interested in the history. 

And I'm always surprised how m uchthey doknow, ver y im pressive. They read really a lotof  

books on the subject.
 
B ef
o re
 
--
 
when I talkto kids in a school, Iusually ask them what have 
you read what do youknow so that I know f rom  what angle tobegin. AndI'm always surpri sed 

 
14
 
thatthey've read so much of the literature which is written for children about the Holocaust. 
Very im pressive what the teachers do with them . Really.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ehave tim ef orone more question and then we're going to wrap up with 
Jo sie  con clu d
in g
 
ou r  pr o gr a m
. S
o stay with us for a couple of m inutes.W e have one more 
here.
 
 
For those of you who just raised your hands,Josie will rem ain on the stageafter she 
f inishes so we invite you to come up here and ask her your question. She'll stay as long asyou 

have a question to ask her. So please do com euphereand do that.
 
 
One question here.
 
>>
 H
im . I wonder if
 
--
 
how your m om  handledthe situation after the concentration cam p.W as 
she angry? Did shef orgive?W hen did shef eel peace? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question, if  I'm  hearing correctly, is how your mother,af ter going through 
what she went through, how did she handle itaf terwards
.  
Did shef ind peaceat some point 
with what she went through? I think that's the question. Or a senseof f orgiveness.W hat was 

your m other's response over the years?
 
 
Andbefore you answer, you shared with m e thatas a
 
child, you remem ber her 
having horrible nightmares.
 
>> Josie T raum :
 
I think it's been extremely difficultf orm y m om . Idon't think she'sever really 
been able to totally understand andforgive whathashappened.
 
W hile she was in Auschwitz, 
they 
did m edic
al experim ents on her. So this is something also that she lived through. I think 
it's haunted her, really, her whole lif e.It's been very, ver y difficult for her. It really has.

>> Josie T raum :
 
As Bill m entioned,at the end of  theprogram  the survi vor or the person who is 
the 
F
i rs t
 P
ersonalways has the last word. I alwa ys read the sam e quote because tome it's 
oneof  them ost important things in this museum .
 
I don't know if any of  you have gone through 
them useum  yet but if you haven't, when youget to the secondf loor, at theend,
 
as you leave 
the secondf loor exhibit, there's a saying on the wall and it's writtenby a Lutheran m inister, 

Martin Niem oller.And to me it is so signif icant that I always read it at theend because it's so 

m eaningf ul.Letm e read it you.
 
 
By the way, Martin Niem oller was ver y, ver y p ro Hitler at thebeginning of  the war. 
You know, Hitler prom ised so many wonderful things. And then when he did see what Hitler 

 
15
 
was doing, he was very m uch against him and he actually was im prisoned. Martin Niem oller 
did not die in prison. He died in the19
80
's. But this is whathe wrote.
 
 
" First they cam efor the socialists,and I did not speakoutbecauseI was not a 
s o c ia lis t .
 
 
T hen they cam efor the trade unionists, and I did not speak out becauseI was nota 
trade unionist
.  
 
T hen they cam efor the Jews, and I did not speakout because I was nota Jew.
 
 
T hen they cam efor me, and there was no one lef tto speakf orm e." 
 
 
T o me, this is what
,  
in a way
,  
this m useum is about.W hen you see injustice, you see 
p e op le  inf lic t in g pa
in on other people, you've got to say som ething.You can really, one person, 
canm ake abig difference. T hat's why I'm  here. People took a chance and they spokeout and 

they helped. 
 
 
T hank you.
