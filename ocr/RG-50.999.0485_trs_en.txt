thank you.
 
 
T his is Manny as a young boy.  He was born to a religious Jewishf am ily on May
 
8 , 
1936.  Manny was just 3 whenW orldW ar II started. Although he was born in Riga, Latvia,

1940, Hungary joinedthe Axis Alliance with Germ any.  T he war and increasing restrictions

Manny's f ather was conscripted to work periodically in 
Hungarian labor battalions.

Germ anforces occupied Hungary in March
 
1944.  Manny andhis mo

by the Nazis to the Bergen

preparation for their eventual departure f rom  Europe. 
 
 
Negotiationsfor their transport toPalestinebroke down and in Decem ber
 
1944
.  A b

six m onthsbefore theend of  the war, Mannyandhis mother were released f rom 

Bergen

children's home where Ella worked as a teacher.  Manny is at thebottom  left of the image.
 
 
Manny, can you join me?  
 
 
Please welcome him  to the stage. T hank you.

he actually do his cantor

studies? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  If you re
call the m aps, m y father is f rom  
e
asternHungary that you know 
better as the hom e of  Dracula, T
ransylvania.  My m other is f rom  southern Hungary which you 
know betteras Y

It was bef ore the First WorldW ar ended. My f irst started in a small community which 
today is called

it ' s
 
inUk ra in e .   He
 
wentto school there.  Eventually 
he
 
got to school in 
Vienna. Vienna hadam ajor internationally known cantor institute. T hat's where he got his

training.  And hisf irst job was in Yugoslavia, where he 
me t  
my
 
m other.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hatwas my next question. He met your mother in Yugoslavia.  T hey 
m arried there?
 
>> Manny Mandel:  In1930.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Did they return to Budapest? W hat was the chronology?
 
>> Manny Mandel: T he chronology has todo
 
with a bit of history.  Part of the issuehad todo 
with thef act thatm y father being born wherehe was was thena citizen of a country that was 

created in 1918, Czechoslovakia.  As a Czech nationaland asa Jew, he had somediff iculties 
ge t t i n g wo r k i n g 
papers in Hungary.  He couldnot geta job in Budapest
 
--
 
could not get working 
papers.  A jobhe could get. T hrough a various series of  whatthey call auditions he tooka 

we l l
-
known job in Riga.
  
In1936 he was ableto get the papersdone in Hungary.  An
d t h at ' s  
when we m oved there. W efoughtf orthe rest of  our lives.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You were born in Riga?
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Yup.  I was just weeksold when they left.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  If ound it interesting. I read through yourfather'soral testim ony. 
 
Maybe you 
have insight into som eof this.  But Inoticed that in1937 or1938 your fatheractually was 

invited to London.  He interviewed f or a jobthere.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Actually, the tim ing is abit off . T hishappenedbef ore he gotthe job in 

Budapes
t.  He interviewed a num ber of places
:  
Holland, London.  He was off ered positions
, 
b
uthe was holding out for aposition in Budapest.  He was still in Riga atthe time. So it was a 
bit earlier. W henhe got the Budapest job, he says
: T h a t's it;
 
I ' ve  a r r

>> Suzy Snyder:  Do you know wh y? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  He was a native Hungarian, spoke Hungarian.  He was part of that whole 
culture. To him  this was the peakof  all establishm ents. If  you want to bea quarterback in the 
city, you better playf or the Redskin

. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Ok. So he returned and took the job in Budapest.You were born in 
‚ 36  i n 
Riga .   Yo u
 
m oved to Budapest.  You rem em ber going to school in Budapest.  Yes? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Sure.  I rem em ber som ething bef ore

[ Fe

You'll recallf rom  the 
notes, m yf irst experience of the Holocaust was not Budapest.  It was no Novi Sad.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Yes, I remember this.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Novi Sad is a city in Yugoslavia, down the Danube River.  It's m y mother's 
hometown.
  
She was not born there but grew up there.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  I want to back upf or a secondthough.  Is this yourf irst memory, period?
 

>> Manny Mandel:  I would think so.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Ok. So yourf irst memory actually is
 
in Novi Sad. You can go ahea
d and 
explain.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Mem ories, you know, we took vacations on the Adriatic coast.  Imay 

rem em ber som ethingfrom  that.  Butf irstm em ory thathasany signif icancebesides playing in 
the sand was this experience.  It was thef irstexperience of the Holocaust. W e went to Novi 
Sad to visit m y grandparents,m y m other'shom etown.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  In 1941.  Right?

>> Manny Mandel: W inter 
‚
41.  Stayed with m y aunt.  My m other
 
had two sisters in Novi Sad. 
S
tayed in the hom e of  one of  them .  And one m
orning som ebody com es up and says 
som ething's going onon the street
; d
on't know what it is. Two m inutes later two policemen 
com e upstairs, say tous
,  ﬁP
lease dress war m ly.  You need to be outside. T here will be a 
census taken."  
 
 
Now, the Germ ans, 
H un g
arians
, all of the Nazis took censuses every 15m inutes 
because they thought if  they could know where you are,they could control your whereabouts. 
 

 
W e were told to gooutside
, 
which we did. W e kindof went in, turned lef t, and began 
to walk for som e tim e. My f ather carriedm e.  My m other carried me. W e were comfortable.  

W e were cold, but it was winter. W ehad warm  coats on
, s
ome kind of  big bootsand things.
 
W emarchedfor a while.  T hism ust have been until close tom aybem id
-
day. T hen we wound 
up 
ina place which I recognized actually.
  
There was on our left a stockadefence. W e were 
am bling along thisfence.  Nothing dangerouswas happening.  Nobody knew why. 
 

 
T hef ence was thefence that separatedthe street area, 
c it y
, f rom  the ri ve r.
 
  
In
 
Eu r
opean cities it is not unusual in the summer tim e if  you have nooceans or lakes, the rivers 
becom e the beaches
 o
f the com munity.  And this place had aam usem ent park, restaurants, 
wake pools, cold pools, therm alpools. T hiswas a ver y nice place. I reme
mber having been 

there like six m onths before. My parents lived in the city.
 
 
W e were marching along, kind of slowl y. W esee thatthe big gates to thisplaceare 
open.  Folksmadea left turn into the gates.As we approached these gates
 
--
 
I ca n 't te ll 
you if  
it's 100
 
yards, 50
 
yards.  Apolicem an standing on the corner says to m yf ather,"

are you doing here?"  My father says, " Visiting m y in
-
l a ws . "   " T
he issue is you are not part of  
this com munity.  If  youand your group is
 
in som e way part
 
of t h e c e ns u s  of t his  c om m un i t y,  i t  
wi ll m ess up the census.  W e cannot mess up.  Stand aside."  Standaside saved our lives.
 
 
By coincidence, I'm  sure, within m inutes of this particular event the staff guard cam e 
down the road. T heseguys had a pow
-
wo w.
  
T h e y 
got on thebullhorn and said, "Ladies and 
G
entlem en, the requirem ents of the censushave been met.T here's a school over there.  
Please goover there.  There's coffee and hotchocolate available.  Have some if  you wish and 
go home."  
 
 
If you're bew
ildered
,  
so were we. 
 
W hat we didn't know until some
tim e  late r
 
--
 
I didn't 
know until a bunch later.  I didn't understand even m uch laterthan that
.  E
verybody who went 
andturned left was m arched to the Danube which had been blastedopenf rom the ice. T h
e 
people there were shot into the river.  They weref ound the next spring if at all.
 
 
Ladies and gentlem en, I describe to you something which you m ight know as the term  
of  Pogrom , a senseless, purposeless, useless, and meaning
le s s
 
exercise in saying I have
 
power and youdon't. T hat's exactly what they did.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So this gendarm eor thisperson who pulled youand yourfam ily out was 
knowingl y sa ving your lives?
 
>> Manny Mandel:  I don't know if  it was knowin gl y.  He just said itwould mess uphis
 
assignm ent. They brought in som e street policem enf rom  Budapest.  He was a street 
policeman in our neighborhood. Recognizedm y f atherf rom the street.  My father lived there.  
W ent to work, off ice, whatever.  He saw.  He recognized.  He says you don't belong here.

>> Suzy Snyder:  But your mother'sf am ily did not suffer during thisPogrom. They were not 
killed during this Pogrom .  Right?
 
>> Manny Mandel: T he aunt with whom  we stayed, her in
-
laws wer e killed inher home.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So som e of your
 
fam ily was  aff ected.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Not the imm ediatef am ily.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  You returned to Budapest.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Imm ediately.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat was it like in Budapest?
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Life was m uch more threatened in thosedays by the war than by the 

Holocaust.  As youheard of  whatSuzy said in the beginning, Hungary was an ally of Germ any 
as a consequence was occupied
.  T
he Hungarian Nazi Party ruled the day.  And I'm not 
suggesting benevolent, but we did not see SS, didn't see black uniforms.  W edidn't see all of  

that which you see in them ovies and documentaries.  Life was in many wa ys acceptable
.  I
t 
becam e restrictive.  You couldn'tdo this, couldn't do that.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  For the Jews.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  For the Jews, of  course. Sorry if  I didn'tm ake that point.
 
 
My uncle was in the universit y.  He was in the last universit y class where Jews were 
adm itted.  But I'm  saying the restrictions happen. T hey didnot affect me.  As a child of 8,I 
was protected in thebubble that was
 
created by m y m other and father.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Once you returned, what happened to yourf ather? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  From  that time,even a little bitbefore then, what happened is that the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
Hungarian malepopulation was conscripted to the Arm y. T hey fought on the Russianf ront at 
onepoint.  So the work that had to be donethat could notbe done by the Russianm ale 
population was done by a force that was organized by the Hungarians, laborf orce of  Jews .  
T hey organized in battalions and regimens.My f ather would getaphone call, visit or note that 
says on Tuesday, beat this train station. You wil l be gonefor aday or two or a month oran 
indeterm inate
 
periodof tim e.  Did this repeatedly f rom before 
‚
41  un t il  
‚
44 when we lef t.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Andhe
 
was still able to practice asa cantor.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  He had lotsof  latitude in that they let him  be away f rom work. W hat else 
could they do?  His job was m aintained, salary gro wing
;  
ye s .
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Slowly, though, there's still these restrictions on the Jewish population. Your 

father, have you heard
 
--
 
did 
he ever s
a y 
to  
you if  God wantstopunish som ebody, thenhis 
capacity to see is taken away?  Have you ever heard him  say that? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  I must have, but
 
--
 
would nothave said it in Yiddish.  Yiddish was never 
the language of ourhom e.  I don't rememberthat.  But I'm  sure he said it.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hereason I bring that up is becausehe said inhis oral testim ony thathe 
felt that there was this
 
--
 
that thepeople didn't really want tobelieve their restrictions couldbe 
turned eventually into murder.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Absolutely so.  No question. They didn't believe it as they were leaving by 
train. T he problem  
wa s
 
--
 
I'll gi ve you anexam ple
 
which is not specif ically m ine, 
b ut.  My 
m other's f am ily n
ame in Yugoslavia was Klein, aG
ermanic nam e.  Her cousins, her generation 
cousins, changed their nam es to rip
-
roaring Hungarian names.  Notbecause they wanted to in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

11
 
som e way a void their Jewish aff iliation. They m aintained that.
  
But they felt so Hungarian that 
they felt they had tohave Hungarian nam es.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T hey were assim ilated into the comm unity.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Not to the loss of the Jewishness.  Yeah, they all had jobsand what not 
and prof essions.  They wante
d to have Hungarian names. They did this. This was something 
that was peculiar perhaps to Hungary, to Germ any. T he populationdid not accept what was 
happening. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  So yourf ather is com ing and going between1941, 1944,around 1944.  

Meanw
hile, you're athom e with your m other
.  W
hat are you doing? Are you going to school?
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Going to school.  I went to a localparochial school, Jewish school. First 

grade and apiece of  second grade. I'm 7 in 
‚

‚

chool begins. 
 
School was much of  my

of  this. W hen you went to the shelters once, twice a night,f ive f loors down and stayed there

 yo u

>> Manny Mandel:  No question.  I would never questionthat.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:
  
Shewas reall y successful in maintaining your childhood.
 
>> Manny Mandel:  As I said 
to  
you,I was ina bubble createdby m y m otherandf ather.  
Mostly m y m other who was therem ore than he was.  As a consequence
, 
what touched me 
was f iltered.  And I could lead the life that I thought was as norm al as it could be.  My 
comm unity was ver y s m all.  I don't know if  itwould have been bigger if no war took place.  
Somebody walked m etom y f riend's houseunless it was in the same building. But I had 
f riends
, h

theseextr acurricular things.  I took piano lessons. Lif ewas good as I knew it.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Righ t.  Life continued. 
 
 
T he Nazis com e in March

we had am aid. W henthem aid was told shehadto leave becauseJews could no longer have 
m aids, that im pactedm e very clearly.  She was a young wom an, 18, 19.  I was about 7. She 
was the closest tom e in age. She was f rom  thefarm . She was notthem ost sophisticated 
thing in the whole world, and she was kindof like m y buddy of sorts. During the day, m orning, 
whatever.  T hen she had to leave. All of a sudden, Margit was gone.  She was gone. 
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  How did it impact your m other?  At thispoint your m other clearly needs to do 

s
om ething.
 
>> Manny Mandel: T he im pactonher lif e,her em otions, what?
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  Her life, trying to save thetwo of  you.
 
>> Manny Mandel: Well, I don't think shehad any optionsto do anything of her own.  She's 

thereessentially in wh at we now call a single m other. My f ather was 
galli vanting
 
wherever  he 
is, notby choice. She has all of  the work to do by herself . And I'm  talking about physical work.
 
>> Suzy Snyder: W hat happened with your apartment?
 
>> Manny Mandel: W e remained. W e lef tf rom that apartment when we leftf or thetrain in 

1944. T he apartm entwas there af ter the war.  My f ather cam e back and saw theapartm ent.  
Andm y granddaughter, who was in Europe ayear ago, even less, visited theapartm ent. It's 
there.T hat did not change. W ehad a very lovely apartm ent.

ou need to 
understand that Eichmann comes to town as the Caesar of the comm unity.  He isthe biggest 
dog in town.  Anything he wants,he can do.Anybody he wants to kill he can by him
s e lf
 
o r 
anybody else. These two guys have the guts, the gall, to demand an audience with him .  

D e m an
d . 
 
 
As it happened, 
Kastner
 
was a lawyer who spoke German.  Br
a nd
 
was an engineer 
who li ved in Germ any. They talked in Germ an. T hat was not unusual. 
 
T hey began to discuss 
som e questions abouthow could therebe som e kind of arrangem ents to save somem e
mb e rs  
of  the comm unity.  Because whenEichm annarrives, within hours literally 12,000 peopleare 
deporteddaily.  That'swhen thedeportation begins.
 
>> Suzy Snyder:  T o Auschwitz?
 
>> Manny Mandel: T o places, Auschwit z, other places.  Eventually Auschwitz, but som etim es 
not directly.
 
 
T he discussionsbegin with thef ollowing proposition. If  Eichmann wi ll release a m illion 
Jews f rom the variouscam ps, he will recei ve for that 10,000 trucks loaded with materiel tobe 
used against the Eastern f ront.
 
>> S u z y 
Snyder:  T hewar eff ort.  Because at this point Germany is starting to sufferduring the 

war eff ort.
 
>> Manny Mandel: T hey know that they are lost. Everybody there knew they were lost exc ept

for Hitler him self  who wouldn't believe it. But theproblem  is
 
Eichmann doesnot have a m illion 
people underhis control anym ore.  And secondly, these guys couldn't come up with the spare 
tire let alone10,000 trucks.  One of the two is sent to Egypt totalk tothe British, the British 
allies tonegotiate trucks. T he chancesof  that happening are what we usually call a snowball 
in hell inthat there were no trucks available. T he British wouldn't give it to them .  If I was the 
British, I wouldn't give trucks to the Germans. 
 
 
And as you rem em ber, the opportunities f
or Jewish populations to be saved inEurope 
were very lo w on the whole totem pole in every country.
  
Having said  that, thesediscussions 
continuedand continued and continuedf rom March until May.  And then in June 
there was a 
decision m ade where
by there would be a test group takenof  1

dollars or pound, sterling, British money.  Nobody did. But diam onds, jewelr y, sm all pieces of  
go l d

As you remember,Eichm ann istaken by theIsraeli secret service in Argentina.  He 
funded
 
his life. Sodidm any of the others through these kinds of

not to say ourm oney but 
through these moneys.
  
By this time the issue goes to

save them selvesf rombeing war crim e eligible and other things. T he 1

600 people, 1

I thinkthat m y uncle was more involved in that thanm y m other. But m y uncle who 
was active in certain comm unities in Hungary and m yf ather who was a known humanbeing in 

the city, they were able to secure these spaces.

So the stench of the ovens at least could notbe claim ed ashaving not been noticedby the 
local population as in Auschwitz.

Belsen very well.  I was sick.  I did
 
that very well.  And I 
was bored.  I didthat very well as well. 
 
 
T he problem  with the sickness was, as youmay know and probably do know, thatas 
today antibiotics take care of pneum onia. Penicillin had just been invented. I assure you the 

f irst  p la ce

Belsen.  So all they could

we had physicians with

Swit zerland by the city, up in the mountains, and converted into a kind of a shelterfor 
displaced persons.W e were therefor several weeks. W e
 
were fed a greatdeal of potatoes.  
Noneof  us were starvi ng to the pointof  counting

though all of us lost weight.  They wanted 
to f atten us up a little bit, potatoes and butter and 
things like that
.   Th
ey had to disperse the

people because were com ing inf rom  various placesasfast as they 
could.  The people made 
arrangem ents in Zurich, whatever theorganization was, was able to take 20 children, all 
Hungarian

speaking kids, and takethem  to achildren's boarding scho
ol in the German part of  
S wit ze rla
nd
, a place called Heiden.  And I went there
 w

By peculiar coincidence, again, guess who was the caretaker,teacher, and everything 
else?  My m other.W hy?  M y m other had been a teacher when shewas a young woman.  

T hey decided they needed somebody to go with these kids who spoke Hungarianonly.  My 
m other obviously spoke Hungarian, but she also spoke very good Germ an
, h
ad a good 
knowledge of  French. 
 
 
T he  
kids there were Germ an and Belgian
 
kids. T h e staff we re  Ge rm a n, Be lgi

to in some way be the interlocutor needed.
  
A ls o ,  
she ran the school.  The kids weref rom age 6 to 14. She ranthe schoolfor each two kids I 
think. But that was there.  So there asthe teacher's kid, it'seitherthe best of your possible lif e

T he synagogue was not reconstructed after the war.  Theone that you saw was reconstructed 
andm ost recently was refurbished as well becauseof  some construction things they had todo

You have tounderstand, please, that the issues of the Holocaust, issues of the war,

Belsen got a uniform unless 
they went outto work, and we didn't.  Nobody was tattooedexcept at Auschwitz and only if  

they went to work.  A num ber acrossthe chest. T hey had a numberon thearm.  Sono 
s u r vi vo r
s who were in Auschwitz who have tattoos.  So there were various kinds of  diff erences.  
 
 
In our situation I tried to make thepoint that to ourfortune
 
we had a situation whereby 
we were a special group because we were the barter. W e were thevaluables t
hat could not 
be destroyed becausethen the valuables could no longer be m ilkedfor themoney to generate

an you talka littlebit more about the bartering, theidea 
of  bartering people

T his was am anner in which the Jewish comm unity

notice f rom Jews
 
who had escaped f rom Auschwit z
 
that Jews were being killed in Auschwitz.  
And the Slovakian

Jewish community was informed of this. Eichm ann and 
Kastner
 
sat down 
af ter thefact, af ter this, becam e known.  Andthis was part of the thing.  
Kastner
's goal was 
strictly to use bartering to save lives.

Manny Mandel: T he original concept in the language they usedwas [Speaking language

enough peopleor they count enough sections of  the city that produced the people to know how 
m any men, wom en, children, whatever therewere. W hatever they were looking for. 
 
 
Rem em ber, there was no census involved in this. T his was a Pogrom  collectin

people. The ruse was we have to have a census so come outside. But thefact is what 
happened ism arch usto death except we didn't quite get there.  Ok?
