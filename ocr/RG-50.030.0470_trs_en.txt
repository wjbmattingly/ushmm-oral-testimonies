THEODORA BASCH KLAYMAN 
 September 24, 2002 
 
Q: Good afternoon, Dora. 
  

A: Goodafternoon. 

  

Q: It™s nice to see you. 

  

A: It™s nice to see you, too. 

  

Q: Dora, what was your name  at birth? 

  

A: Teodora Basch. Teodora Rachela Basch. 

  

Q: Teodora Œ T- e-o or T- h? 

  

A: T-e-o. It got changed mu ch later on when I 
got American citizenship. Once I came to the 
States, I got tired of telling 
everybody that my name  was ju
st like Theodora, but without 
the ﬁhﬂ. So, when I got my c
itizenship, and was asked if I 
would like to change anything 
in my na me , I said, ﬁYes, please give me  an 
‚h™.ﬂ [Laughs.] So, that
™s how, but I did not 
change- 
  

Q: So, that™s how the ﬁhﬂ came . 

  
A: That™s how the ﬁhﬂ came. The Rachela part
 I kept as is, even 
though, of course, it™s 
Rachel, but it wasn™t importan
t to change, and since I mostly
 just use my initials, so I 
didn™t change that. 
  
Q: And your name  now is? 

  

A: My name  now is Theodora Rachela Klayma n. 

  

Q: But you use Dora. 

  

A: I have had a variety of nickname s. I use Do
ra. I noticed that in 
the pictures during my 
childhood, that some times there is a photograph wh
en I was like six months old that was 
sent by my mother to my grandparents, and 
it says, ﬁTeaﬂ. So, at one point, I had the 
nickname Tea from The a, but I don™t reme mber
 being called that. Then, in Croatia, Dora 

is a rather sort of, a name , a very folksy name use d usually sort of used for old ladies, and 

that™s not what I was ever called. I was calle
d ﬁDoricaﬂ as a child. So, if we go back now, 

I™m still called Dorica, and at home, I ofte
n was also called ﬁDorekﬂ, and when I came 
here, I became  ﬁ Doraﬂ, and that™s how 
it™s Œ it™s sticking to that one now. 
  

Q: So, no one here calls you Dorica?

A: No, no, just my Œ my Cr oatian Œ well, Lucie some times does. 

  

Q: Do you like that? 

  

A: It™s very Œ it™s sort of very Œ it™s Œ its,
 dimi nutive names are used a lot in all Slavic 
countries. So, it™s very normal for some one fr
om a Slavic country to use that, but it™s 
really not Œ it sounds very strange, I th
ink, in English. I know a young woma n who lives 
here who™s from Belgrade, and she™s called 
Bekica, and it™s Becky, and to me  it™s like 
sounds very strange. It™s sort of like, you 
know, Dolly or some thing like that, and you 
don™t use those names very much. 
  

Q: When were you born? 

  

A: January31,1938. 

  

Q: And, you were born- 

  

A: InZagreb. 

  

Q: InZagreb? 

  

A: I was born in Zagreb. I was 
born in Zagreb, apparently. I 
checked that about two years 
after my parents were married, and I lived ther
e only the fi rst two and a half, three years 
of my life. My mother was not 
originally Zagreb. My father™s
 family lived in Zagreb, and 
that not for a very long time  in history. I mean, they came, I think, when my father was 
already in his early teens or so. They came 
mostly from Bosni a . They were not however 
Sefardi. They had come  there from, I think, 
elsewhere in Europe. And then came to live 
in Zagreb, and my father™s family tended to 
be cantors. They were
 very Œ it was a very 
religious family, and they studied cantorial 
music and one of them, one of my uncles, 
Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied 
very seriously. Another uncle, Joseph, also 
studied seriously. My father, I th
ink, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to Œ also to 
be a cantor at times, and me t my mot her. So, 
my mother™s family was from a different 
town. They were from t he town, a very sma
ll town called Ludbreg; it™
s further north from 
Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very cl
ose to Hungary, but that town, in contrast 
to others, did not have a Hungarian populat
ion. I never learned H
ungarian. My mother 
apparently did. My grandfather on my mother™s
 side was the rabbi of
 that town, Ludbreg. 
There were some 30 plus Jewish families. 
I think about, according to some books that 
I™ve seen, about 37 Jewish fa milies. And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come 
and be a rabbi there, and they came from 
Czechoslovakia, and he Œ he came  from 
Bratislava already with his Œ with the fa m
ily, and so I don™t know exactly how old he 
was, but from what I gather, most of his wr
iting, he did quite a b
it of writing, published, 
was in German, though he did learn Croatian, sp
oke in Croatian, but I think all of his 
writing is in German. I have papers wher
e he wrote by hand and you can see that. Though 
his publications are in Cr oatian Œ I have so
me  of the stuff that he published mostly 
treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don™t know
 exactly. I™ve only been told all these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
3 
 
things, and I don™t know really if he wrote in
 German and some one translated, or whether 
he wrote directly in Croatian. 
  
Q: What was your father™s name ?  

  

A: My father™s name  is Salamon Œ Shlomo, Salamo n, and my mother™s name was Silva, 
which is Silvia, of course. 
  

Q: And her ma i den name  was Deutsch? 

  

A: Deutsch. So, my grandfather, my ma t e
rnal grandfather was Leopold Deutsch. My 
grandmother was Katarina, and they had three children. I™m sorry, they had three 

daughters and a son, four children. The oldest  Œ the oldest daughter was Giza, then 

Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Erne. 
  

Q: And Giza plays an important role in your life? 

  

A: Giza plays an important role in my life. 
Well, Blanka does too in some sense because 
basically they lived sort of t
ogether. The fa mily lived togeth
er. It was a small town. Giza 
was ten years, I™m sorry, fifteen years older 
than my mother. So, she often was sort of 
active as my  mother™s mother in they Œ I see pictur es that they had traveled together, for 

example, all three sisters to the seashore. 
The mi ddle sister got ma rried fairly young and 
had two children, two daughters Œ Zdenka a
nd Vera. Their name  was Appler, and the 
youngest Œ the youngest daughter, my mother, was 
eventually sent to a school in Cakovec 
which is another small town, much larger to
wn actually than Ludbreg, muc h closer even 
to the Hungarian border, and she went ther
e to a teacher™s Œ a 
teacher™s school, became 
an elementary school teacher. The mi ddle si
ster who was ma rried, was ma rried to Rudi 
Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, a
nd that™s Œ and that™s where they had two 
children. The oldest of the three, Giza, wo
rked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and 
there she me t a person who was to play a la
rge part in my life and that was Ludva 
Vrancic. Ljudevit is actually hi s real name. I™
ll get back to him. The brother Erne worked 

in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I™m not
 exactly sure what he did there. I think 

clerical work of some  sort. I™ m not sure of what he did. A
nd the Œ my mo ther eventually 
finished the teacher™s school and worked as a 
teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for 
a short period of time. Then my father and sh
e me t and ma rried and left to live in Zagreb, 
and that™s how I happened to have been born in Zagreb. 
  

Q: So, let me  ask you some t hing, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 
1941. 
  

A: Right. 

  

Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to dis
tinguish what you™ve lear
ned from other people 
and what you actually reme mber, because you we
re so little. So, if you can, as you speak, 
make that distinction, it mi ght be very helpful.
 So, this is what my first question is for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
4 
 
you. What is your Œ do you have any me mories
 before 1941, before you leave Zagreb to 
go to Ludbreg? 
  
A: Images. 

  

Q: Images? 

  

A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my moth
er, but it™s very hard to really tell because  I 
was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my
 parents, which I think 
a lot of children that 
lived through the Holocaust never got to have
. And so it™s very difficult because I™ve seen 
those pictures all my life. It™s very difficu
lt to really di stinguish what™s memory and 
what™s a photograph that you have
 in your head. So, I think I have an image in my head, 
but I can™t really tell you whet
her I do or don™t. I think I have
 an image of myself leaving 
on a train, because I left apparently when I wa
s three years old. I left Zagreb with friends 
of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, a
nd that happened before, just before, the war 
started, from what I understand. And, again, 
I don™t have any idea whether Œ because 
people often ask me  whe t her I reme mber whet
her I was sent away because my parents 
were afraid of what™s going to happen, or whet
her I was just going to visit my fa mily just 
to visit my family or whether my mo ther, 
who already Œ my brother had already been 
born, he was three years younger than I Œ 
whether, you know, she said, you know, why 
not have this kid go away while she has 
a baby?  I have no Œ no idea why I was sent 
except there was an opportunity. These neighbor
s came and I went with them, and I don™t 
reme mber being tearful or I don™t reme mber th
e farewell. I don™t reme mber any of that, 
but that was the last time  I saw my pa rents.
 I don™t reme mber any farewells. I reme mb er 

sort of being on the train and there being fun. 
  
Q: It was fun? 
  

A: Mm-h mm. 

  

Q: Was that the first time  you were on a train? 

  

A: Oh, I think so, probably. Well, I 
don™t know. It™s very hard to tell. 
  

Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: You don™t reme mber him as
 this tiny little baby? 
  

A: No. No. I mean, I reme mber him, however, when I do reme mber him ve ry well is when 
he was brought to Ludbreg. That I reme
mber. That I really do reme mber.  
  

Q: So, were you told about your mother goi
ng to school, because clearly you were too 
young. Your mother wouldn™t ha ve explai
ned to you that she was a teacher. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
5 
 
A: No, none of that. I™m just sa
ying the background of what really
 Œ of what this family was 
all about, who was who. I have not the foggies
t. No, of course not, 
because all of that 
happened before I was born. 
  
Q: What did your father do? 

  

A: My father had apparently learned the tr
ade of brushmaking, a
nd had opened a workshop 
to make brushes. From what I am told by hi
s surviving brother, he
 was very good at it, 

and by the time that I was born, I can tell from
, a gain, from t he pictures of hi m, what 
people told me , there was a small workshop 
with, I don™t know, ten or so workme n, and 

there was machinery and they ma de brushes an
d was very successful at it. But, I, again, 
don™t have any me mory of it. I 
only know pictures and stories. 
  

Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult pers
on thinking about who were these parents and 
what you have are paper pictures? 
  

A: It™s not actually that di ff icult. The reason 
for it is that it was not a new discovery that I 
ma de as an adult. If I had known nothing of th
at, and all of a sudden 
as an adult it came 
upon me , yes, of course, it would have been difficult. But I grew up with all of that. It™s Œ 

it™s just part and parcel of 
my growing up. I always heard stories and always knew who I 
was and I always had these pictures so th
at, you know, it™s, you know, you just to grow 
up with stories. That™s all. 
  

Q: So, you go to Ludberg- 

  

A: Ludbreg, which actually has a meaning. The 
word ﬁludﬂ in Cr oatian means crazy or ma d. 
This is kind of crazy. And ﬁbregﬂ, I think, 
means a mountain, but it also could be the 
words got transposed and it was ﬁbergﬂ 
which me ans town. So, I don™t know. Nobody 
ever expl ained why this is 
called that, but it™s Ludbreg. 
  

Q: Do you have a first me mory of Ludbreg
?  Reme mber arriving?  You don™t reme mber - 
  

A: No, I don™t reme mber arriving. 

  

Q: With your grandparents? 

  

A: I reme mber very well being with my grandpa
rents. That I do reme mber, and again, I have 
certain images like I remember sitting with my
 grandfather in a room and playing at  his 
feet, and he was paralyzed already on one 
side because he had a stroke. And he was 
trying to pick up the toys that 
I was playing with, some thing lik
e that, and he fell. It was a 
trauma tic experience for me . So, I reme
mber that, and I reme mber Hanukkah. I 

r e me mb e r  t h e -  
  

Q: What happened after he fell? 

  

A: Oh, someone came Œ he 
couldn™t pick himself up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
6 
 
  
Q: Youjust-- 

  

A: I just reme mber that I was guilty of 
throwing the toys around or some thing. So, I 
reme mber being upset and crying. So, that™s 
why I reme mbe r  that. I remember Hanukkah 

for example, but not the whol
e thing. I reme mber candles and I reme mber getting an 
orange, which was very exciti
ng. Oranges were not to be ha
d. I reme mb er at Pesach, or 
before Pesach. I reme mb er that they were 
burying silverware, and I thought that was a 
very strange thing to do, but that
™s apparently what can be done. I found that much later. I 
had no idea of that. I reme mber my
 grandfather sitting in the ga
rden with all of us playing 
around and he used to Œ he used to have his 
little table in front. This was, mi nd you, we 
were living in the house that was attached
 to the synagogue, and it was also Œ and 
everythi ng Œ all the Jewish community ma tters 
played themselves out there. So, there was 
also the school and there were some  kind of 
classrooms, and, of course, that was there 
much later. It™s been destroyed now, but Œ s
o, he would sit in the 
garden with the little 
table and he had little piles of
 money in front of him and there were beggars that were 
sort of like professional beggars in that 
town, and they would come  Wednesdays and 
Saturdays because those were ma rket days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he 

wouldn™t do that, but Œ that™s 
Shabbat, but on We dnesdays they would sit and they would 
come and take their little piles. 
  

Q: They, as far as you knew, they were 
specifically for these particular people? 
  

A: Yes, yes, there was specific people. There wa
s a specific beggar that used to come  to our 
Œ to the house where I lived much, much later and he would come  every We dnesday and 

would always get alms, and I reme mber seeing 
him later on on the train and being like a 
norma l person, you know?  It was very strange, 
but they were characters. Ludbreg™s a 
very small town, and especially was, a
nd everybody sort of knew everybody and there 
were all these sort of different
 routines that were going on. 
  
Q: Since you said there were about 30 familie
s who lived here, how much larger was the 
town?  A couple of hundred fa milies?  
  

A: Yes, and all of these famili
es did not live in Ludbreg proper,
 either. Some  of them were 
in surrounding villages. Ludbreg is sort of
 like the county seat, and there were ma ny 
surrounding villages, and those villages did not
 have either their own Jewish anything, 
nor did they have even middle schools. For 
example, later on when I went to mi ddle 
school, people, kids from those villages would come  to school, and that was also the 

place where ma rket that was happening, and any ki
nd of offic i al pape rs we re held and so 
on and so forth. So, it wa s sort of a Œ basically
 like a county seat. So, 
anyway, back to the 
images of my grandfather. T
hose are the images that I have my grandparents, but of 
course- 
  

Q: Youonlymentioned- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
7 
 
A: My grandfather Œ yes, I know. I remember 
my gr andmother less. I think I reme mber her 
more from pictures than I reme mber anyt
hing that went on in the house, strangely 
enough. No meals, no nothing.  
  
Q: Noplaying? 

  

A: I don™t reme mber that, no. 

  

Q: Peeling potatoes or something? 

  

A: No, I don™t reme mber any of that. 

  

Q: It™sinteresting. 

  

A: It™sinteresting,right. 

  

Q: Maybe you actually spent more
 time  with your grandfather. 
  

A: It™s possibl e. It™s possibl e. 

  

Q: Do you have any recollection of wonde
ring who you parents 
are after a while? 
  

A: No. I know- 

  

Q: You™re there probably the end of March- 

  
A: I™m there visiting. The next me mory I  have in my grandparents™ house, I reme mber one 
evening, being lots of commotion, lots of 
unhappiness, and then, lo and behold, there 
arrives a baby, and that Œ a child, a young ch
ild. That was my brot
her. I reme mber his 
arriva l because he looked very strange. He 
had lines, like brown lines on his face, and I 
thought, ﬁWhat™s with the brown lines?ﬂ I know
 now that basically he was crying and 
there was dirt on the road until they washed him up and so on. I know now what had 
happened, but I don™t have a me mor y of that. I only know what happened. 
  

Q: So, what did happen? 

  

A: Whathappened- 

  

Q: What were you told?  Your grandpa
rents told you or do you reme mber? 
  

A: I was constantly surrounded by this exte
nded family. So, there was my grand Œ there 
were my grandparents and then only about tw
o blocks away lived the mi ddle sister, my 
mother™s mi ddle sist er of the three sisters,
 Blanka with her husband and two of my 
cousins Vera and Zdenka, and then there 
was also Giza, who by that time was also 
ma rried, and her husband Ludva, the Vrancic fa
mily. So, there was constant comi ngs and 
goings, so that I don™t know who said what, 
and in fact, I reme mber that evening in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
8 
 
particular when my brother arrived, and then 
I reme mber also being 
sort of distracted 
later on the next day by my two cousins who to
ok me away. I spent much time with them. 
So, I was just  sort of floating between these 
families. I don™t reme mber being particularly 
rooted in one place or  another. But, a
nyway, the reason Œ what happened with my 
brother. That must have after the fall of
 Yugoslavia, April ™41. My parents were 
apparently almost i mme diately taken into ja
il, led and my mother had my brother with 

me . We had Œ I don™t know if it was a 
housekeeper or some body who lived nearby, a 
non-Jewish woma n, and she went and was able to
 get my brother out. So, he was in jail 
with my parents for a very short period of tim
e. Then she got him out, and she must have 
phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and 

they imme diately Œ the olde
st sister, Giza and her husba
nd who was not Jewish, Ludva 
Vrancic, they went immediately to Za greb a
nd they got my brother,
 and they brought him 
back to Ludbreg. And that™s Œ that™s what ha
ppened that night, and that™s Œ they brought 
him and he was there. He  was nine months old at that time , and 
so he was crying and 
carrying on, and that™s about 
what I reme mber of that. And I reme mber everybody being 
nervous and upset and- 
  

Q: Youdo? 

  

A: Ido. 

  

Q: But, nobody sits down and tries to
 explain to this little girl? 
  

A: No, if they did, I don™t reme mber it. Th
ey may have, but I don™t remembe r  it. I 
reme mber, you know, lots of conversations 
and things and commotions and then just 
going off wi th my cousins to play. I reme mber
 being, at one point, th
at they were pulling 
me  on a sled. So, it must have been wi nter time by then, and so it must have been later. I 

don™t know when. But, I reme mber being on a sl
ed and their telling me  some thing about a 
war. 
  

Q: So, if your brother was nine months old? 

  

A: So, that must have been later than that. 
Yeah, that image of be i
ng on a sled must have 
been later. 
  

Q: But if your brother was born in January of ™45. 

  

A: Hewas. 

  

Q: War came in April ™
45. So, it™s in the fall. 
  

A: It™s in the fall. It  must have been in the fall. 

  

Q: November or December. 

  

A: Mm-hmm, which is very likely that in
 Ludbreg there mi ght be snow already. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
9 
 
  
Q: September,October? 

  

A: Not September, October, but by November
 there mi ght be snow. Some  s now Œ so, it 
mi ght not have been all at the same  time, that
 I have that image from. It™s just like the 
images are often not connected. They kind of 
live in my head, but th
ey™re not necessarily 
Œ the chronological order is off. 
  

Q: Of course, I understand, but is that your
 first recollection of
 seeing your brother? 
  

A: Yes, yes, it is, and then we were together
 from then on. We  were 
always together from 
then on until his death. 
  

Q: Were you glad he was there?  Or did it 
take some thing away from you whe n he came ? 

  

A: When he came, I don™t know whether I paid 
that much attention. Eventually, it was kind 
of nice having him around some ti mes, but some tim
es I was Œ with time, as he got to be 
bigger, he played a large role
 in everybody™s life. He was ve
ry cute and very smart and I 
was often very jealous, especially later on, he
 got to be Œ he was very personable and 
both of us were very redhead. This is very muted now. I mean, I was flami ng red and so 

was he, and he was very cute and he had 
a very good me mory. He™d me morize very long 
poems , and he would stand up and recite 
them, and I was like, ﬁUgh, there he goes 
again.ﬂ But, the whole town was very fond 
of hi m, and he Œ he some how acquired a 
nickname  ﬁLovrekﬂ which wasn™t his name
, and everybody thought it was his name , but 
it wasn™t .  
  
Q: What does Lovrek mean? 
  

A: Nothing, I don™t know how that came about
, actually. I have no idea how that came  
about.  
  

Q: FromZdrav? 

  

A: His name  was Zdravko, which is very hard for you I™m sure to pronounce, but it™s 
actually means hime (ph), because 
zdravlje
 is health. Apparently, my Œ from what I was 
told, agai n, I was told that  my mother want
ed us to have very Croatian name s. People 
were very, very much into being Croat, a
nd Nationalists, and so on. So, those two name s 

were supposed to be, you know, real Croatian 
name s. We we ren™t going to have such 
name s as who knows what. 
  

Q: So, Teodora is very Croat? 

  

A: Doricais. 

  

Q: Dorica? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
10 
 
A: Yes. There is a thing ﬁ
Dorica pjeva, zemlja se treseﬂ
, which means ﬁDorica sings and the 
earth is shakingﬂ, and I™ve been told a zil
lion time s, every time some one hears my na me. 
  
Q: We™re going to stop now and change the tape.

Tape #2
 
  
Q: Dora, do you have your first recollection of 
the effect of a wa r or some thing, anything 
that has to do with this chaos 
that obviously encumbering Croatia? 
  

A: Well, I Œ I have me mori es that have todo with what must have then been become  a 
persecution, with the issu
ing of lists, et cetera, et ceter
a, and you know, historically we 
know what happened. There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came  to Ludbreg 

and, they Œ people were being rounded up. I 
was not aware of that as such, but I do 
reme mber people leaving and I remember be
ing left behind, and I didn™t know exactly 
what was happening. Perhaps, again, they toldme , but I didn™t understand what they were 

telling me . But, as I me ntioned, my Aunt Bla
nka and her family lived next door to Aunt 
Giza and Ludjevit, and ba sically I reme mber at
 one point people comi ng and we were all 
in one room and they came with satchels or
 small suitcases in their hands and pillows 

under their arms and saying goodbye and leavi
ng. And I didn™t know exactly what was 
going on and why were they leaving and w
ho was crying, and I was sad because these 

were my cousins, but that™s the image that I 
have in my head of their leaving. And I had 
the sense that  it was, there was something th
at was dangerous and 
bad and that people 
were being taken away. I don™t have the im
age of my grandparents leaving. I don™t 
reme mber that. I reme mb er my cousins. I know
 that my grandparents were taken at the 

s a me  t i me .  
  

Q: At the same time? 

  

A: Mm-hmm. Fairly early, they all left. I also
 know that my cousins, I know that now, that 
my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite
 a bit of time and the mi ddle aunt, Blanka, 
the mi ddle aunt and her husband, that they had le
ft for awhile and went to the Italian part 
of the country, that they were some place in 
Dalmatia. And then there was a proclama tion 
by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who 
had left, should return, and if they return 
they will be spared, nothi ng will happen to them, and they st upidly returned. I have a 

very good friend of mi ne  who still lives in Zagreb now. Her fa mily, which was another 

fa mily in Ludbreg left also, and had left be
fore this proclama tion and they cleverly did 
not return. They were the only Jewish fa mily, 
in fact, that returned after the war intact 
because they were smart enough not to return, 
actually because the mother in the fami ly 
said she was absolutely not returning, and so 
they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan-
held territory in Kordun. But, people who 
returned believing that this was going, you 
know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone. 
  

Q: Is it possibl e that it was Œ there was a list, 
and people knew they were supposed to go so 
they didn™t have to be 
rounded up, they went, yes? 
  

A: I think some body must have come  and gotten them and had the list, and I Œ I tried to 
reconstruct why I wasn™t taken, and I hadn™t th
ought about it before even to ask my ___ 
with whom I eventually grew up, ﬁWhy wasn
™t I taken ever? ﬂ  Besides having been 
hidden here and there, which I know I was, 
because people would warn us that there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
12 
 
would be a raid. I have a feeling that I was not
 on the list. I had s
een one of those lists. 
One of the m is published in a book on Ludbre
g, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, 
and my aunt s are there, and 
everybody™s listed, and I™m not 
on the list, neither is my 
brother. I have a feeling that the mus t  ha
ve gotten the list ma ybe from the synagogue, 
from the community center, and of course, I 
was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and 

I was not considered a, you know, a me mber 
of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I 
was not on that list. That™s a possibility. Bu
t the other thing is that I know that ma ny 
times we we re warned that there would be 
a raid, and perhaps I Œ if they had been 
warned, they would have hidden some place, but I always wondered why in the world 

were they sitting there?  Li ke sitting ducks.
 Even I Œ I mean I didn™t have a choice, of 

course, I was a child Œ but I™m thinking, ﬁ Why 
in the world we re we there? ﬂ I recently, 
my aunt ma de a tape of her experiences- 
  

Q: This is Magda? 

  

A: Magda, and she was in Za greb this whole ti
me. They stayed until the bitter  end and they 
could barely escape at that point. I wa s lik
e, ﬁWhy were you there? ﬂ You know, it™s very 
hard for me  to understand. It
™s not hard to understand why they didn™t Œ why in some  
places there was no place to go, but I think in
 Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, 
it was a town that was ve ry close to the Œ to wh
ere the Partisans where. It™s at  the foot  of 
the mountains, and of course, it was very diffi
cult and Partisans had a very difficult life, 
but for those of us who were so vulne rable, why we didn™t you go some pl ace into a small 

village or smaller village. I mean, this wa
s small, but it wasn™t really sma ll, not by 
Croatian standards. Why we stayed there, 
I don™t know. Faith that we would not be 
wanted?  Or some thing?  I don™t 
really know. But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, 
we would Œ we would go places. I reme mber
 one time going to Varazdin, which is a 
larger town nearby, and staying with a relativ
e, and I think this 
was the time that I 
understood that it was dangerous to stay and th
at we had to hide for a few days. The other 
Œ all the other hiding that I did was sort of 
nearby with Œ mo stly with friends, and there 
were a number of fa milies. There was the Zi
za, the Runjak family, my brother and I 
would spend some  ti me  with, especially Ludbr
eg Œ Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. 
We were really not so much in a concentra
tion camp kind of situation. We were in a war 
Œ we were in a war zone. So, when it was Œ wh
en it was time  to hide because the Ustashe 
took town, then I spent, for example, time with
 this Runjak family, and they had rented 
from this other house which was now e mpty. They had rented that apartment, and we 

stayed with them. And I called Mrs. Runjak 
ﬁMotherﬂ when I knew 
that it was dangerous, 
and I understood at that point 
what was dangerous, and my 
brother called her ﬁMotherﬂ 
all the time because he wouldn™t know how 
to distinguish from when it was dangerous 
and when it wasn™t. So, I lived with them, a
nd they had three teenage children, and it™s 
thoroughly amazing because I reme mber Ustash
e ma king ca mp in our backyard, and we 

were there, and just pretendi
ng that we were part of this
 other fa mily. And it™s amazing 
some ti me s because the whole town essentially knew who we were. That™s the most 

amazing part of all. In a small town like 
that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi™s 
grandchildren, and at no point did an
ybody say, ﬁWhat about these kids? ﬂ   
  

Q: So, is there some  way in which the town is protecting you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
13 
 
  
A: It wasn™t organized. Yeah, de
finitely. It wasn™t an organize
d kind of thing, but a lot of 
people in that town were really Partisan 
sympathizers, and I know a number of people 
who lost, who perished, who lost
 their lives as Partisans duri
ng the war. People across the 
street lost their one and only son. So, I thi
nk -- unwittingl y, I mean, not in an organized 
ma nner, but it just was not a kind of town that would Œ that would say, ﬁOh, well, go 

some  place else.ﬂ Or, ﬁYou™re endangering us.ﬂ
 I was endangering some  of these people, 
and Œ but, they took us in anyway. So, but, 
anyway, our bad experiences during the war 
really had to do with the fighting, which ev
erybody experienced, not 
just the Jews. Just 
there was only brother and I and my a unt that
 were left at the end. Because there were 
fights especially at night. Ther
e would be terrible fights.  
  

Q: In the st reets? 

  

A: In the streets, yes. 

  

Q: Really? 

  

A: Yeah, oh yeah. There we re Œ the street th
at I lived on was afte
r the war called, ﬁThe 
Street of the 17
th
 
Udarna Brigada
ﬂ. I don™t know how to transl
ate Œ Brigade is Brigada, 
of course. Udarna means Œ it™s striking, one 
who can strike well, particularly well. And 

the reason it™s called that is because  the me mb
ers of that brigade, the remn ant of that 
brigade lost their lives. They ki
lled themselves at the end of 
the battle in a house that was 
down my street because they were totally su
rrounded. They had fought all night, and they 
were totally surrounded, and in the end, th
ey just threw a bomb a mong themselves 
because they didn™t want  to be captur ed. Bu
t there were fights and we would spend Œ we 
spent a lot of time in the basement. We had 
a cellar, not a basement in an American 
sense. It was a cellar. We  had a vineyard, 
and we had wine, and there were big barrels 
down there, and shelves and shelves full of appl
es that were there for the winter. And at 
one point, we  had beds down there, rolla
way beds. And we spent every night there 
because we knew that there would be  bad 
fighting. Sometimes, but sometimes, we would 
forget to go down there on time, and Œ not fo
rget Œ I™m sorry, we didn™t know that we 
should go down there on time. So, then if a fi
ght Œ if a battle star
ted, there was no way to 
get there because you had to get out of the house 
to get Œ to go into 
the cellar, and so it 
was too dangerous already to do that. So, we stayed in the house. 
  

Q: Where would you stay? 

  

A: We Œ yeah, I reme mber. That I reme mber ve
ry well. Some times the bullets were fl ying 
like crazy through the house. There was one ni
ght, I won™t forget, where the house across 
the street was a two-story house and ours was 
a one-story house, and they were shooting 
from our backyard into that house across th
e street back and forth. The bullets were 
flying through our windows, and I was sleepi
ng on the sofa in a corner. So, if you can 
imagine a corner and then window-window. S
o, I was fairly well protected, but I was 
scared to death and I don™t ha
ve any recollection of where my
 brother, but my aunt and 
uncle were sleeping in the room next to my
 room, and for some strange reason, I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
14 
 
everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left
 there, but there was a window that was 
Œ that was right facing out from this be
droom, and I reme mbe r  crying and asking for 
some body t o come , and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come  to 
comfort me  than a bullet landed on the pillow of
 his bed. He would™ve been killed if not 
for the fact that I had been crying. But in the mo rning some time s, you looked out the 

window Œ I reme mber one time it was a horribl
e battle, and we looked Œ in Croatia you 
have these Œ they™re not 
shades in our sense. 
  

Q: Shutters? 

  

A: No, not even shutters. They™re more like ou
r Venetian blinds, but they are on the outside 
and they are wooden, and you pull them up like 
that, but so, you can also turn them s o 
that you can kind of peer out. I reme mber 
peering out, and that 
is a recollection I 
definitely have of carriag
es going by our windows full of dead Œ nude, dead bodies 
because they had collected them and then just
 stripped them of clothes and were taki ng 
them someplace. 
  

Q: Were these horse drawn? 

  

A: Horse-drawn. 

  

Q: Like a cart? 

  

A: Horse-drawn carts, yes. 

  

Q: Did you see that often? 
  
A: No, not often. I reme mb er that one very we
ll. We lived on a main Œ pretty much main 
street on the corner of two very important ma
in streets so that when things went by, we 
saw them. And, also, often Œ well, as these 
bullets would come th
rough, I mean, after the 
war, our living room and one of the bedrooms 
we re riddled with bullets, and the Œ we had 
these armoires and cabinets of books and th
ey had bullet holes through them, and if you 
opened the tablecloths, it looked like a doil
y, you know, all full of b
eautifully separated. 
  

Q: If you couldn™t get into the cellar, would 
you lie on the floor so th
at you wouldn™t be by a 
window?  
  

A: Sometimes, yes, and we would some times also
 go into the side of the house that didn™t 
have windows to the street. There was one side
 of the house into th
e hallway, except that 
one night that I reme mb er so well, when we
 stupidly stayed where we shouldn™t have 
stayed. I think some ti mes it was so bad that
 nobody wanted to move. But most of the 

time, -- mos t  of the Œ it™s very Œ it™s horribl
e, I hate to say that, but I reme mber being 
quite exhilarated by it all at time s. I should ha
ve been Œ instead of being afraid, I used to 

think it was sort of very ex
citing to have these battles goi
ng on, and thinking it was quite 
great fun to sleep down in 
the cellar where there were always some  frogs jumping 
around.

Q: Maybe as a child - 

  

A: As a child, it is so much better. I mea
n, I™m sure the adults were totally, totally 
trauma tized, but as a child, it™s very intere
sting looking back, and 
I™m looking now at my 
granddaughter who is now about the age that
 I wa s at the end of the war, and I™m 
thinking, ﬁCan you imagine what some thing like 
that would do to her?ﬂ And, yet, when I 
think of mys elf at the time, 
I don™t think I was so horribly sc
ared at ma ny of the points. I 
was more Œ I think there were some  things that
 were just very scary, like seeing all these 
bodies going by. And there was a time  that Œ an 
image that I have very much in my head 
again, that was another thing 
that happened in Ludbreg. There were Œ the Ustashe would 
take people who were thought to be sympat
hizers of the Partisans, which they were, 
ma ny of them, and if they Œ some ti mes they would catch them, some  of them were sent to 

concentration camp and that in
cludes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually ma rried my 
aunt and he wasn™t Jewish. I didn™t explain 
that part, but at any rate, he ended up in 
concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, 
and they would take 
them either  to camp 
and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just  in town, and I 

do have a very vivid ima ge of going with one of
 our cleaning ladies to the ma in square 
and I wasn™t supposed to see it. She was hol
ding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it. There 
was a body hanging on every one of the trees 
around the square, and I reme mber people 
saying Œ they were Œ because they we re Partisans, that™s why. 
  

Q: Now, when you saw some thing like that, a
nd you saw the dead body, was that different 
for you then when you were in the mi dst of this fighting? 
  

A: Well, yeah, that Œ because  the fighting was sort of like a ﬁStar Wa rﬂ kind of thing like a 
game , and I didn™t really Œ I 
don™t think I understood too well
 at the time what is the 
result of all this shooting, but I was sc
ared to death when nobody was with me , and I 
cried a lot. So, there were times when I was 
very scared. But, we played war so much, 
you know, when I was a child, that™s the game  
we played. You played Œ you played with, 
like I reme mber playing with dried corn st
alks. You would Œ you know when they were 
cut off?  And they were supposed to be  fed to
 the cows, and we use those to battle each 
other in play war. 
  

Q: And what kind of war was it? Middle age war or contemporary war? 

  

A: No, no, it was contemporary war. 

  

Q: So, you used guns? 

  

A: These were guns, yes. 

  

Q: And were you Germans and Croatians or what? 

  

A: No, we were not Germans and Croatia
ns. We  were Ustashe and Partisans. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
16 
 
Q: Ah-ha! 
  

A: No, we didn™t have anything to do with Ge
rmans. The Germans Œ I never saw a German. 
All during the war, I never saw a German. 
We  had our own Germans, our own Nazis. 
  

Q: What side did you play on? 

  

A: Oh, well, you always wanted to be the 
Partisans. Some body had to lose, and some body 
had to win. 
  

Q: And did the Partisans win all the time? 

  

A: In our game s, yes, in our game s, yes.  

  

Q: And how did the game s work? 

  

A: Well– 

  

Q: Did you go ﬁbang-bang, you™re deadﬂ or what? 

  

A: Yeah, and the boys would usually take
 the upper hand and the girls would lose. 
  

Q: Was it girls against boys? 

  

A: Sometimes. 

  
Q: Really? 
  

A: Some times, some ti me s. There was an empt
y space across the street which belonged to 
the church, and it was Œ they ju
st started building it, but they
 never finished building it. 
So, it was sort of empty, and you could hide 
inside there, and that™s where we often 
played our games, and also in our backyard we had sort of a shed. It was built rather than 

a shed. It was sort of attached to the st ruct
ure, and in that structure we had a press for 

pressing grapes to get wine, and that was ot
herwise pretty empty. That was also a good 
place to play. 
  

Q: Now, this is not your grandfather™s place. 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: This is the neighbor™s. 

  

A: No, no, that belonged to th
e Vrancic fa mily. The Vrancic family had a house that was 
built by my uncle™s father, and they came to Ludbreg when he was Œ when that father  was 

very young. So, it was in the mi d-1800s. They we
re well educated and very old Croatian 

fa mily. They count their ancestors to some thing like the 12
th
 century where there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
17 
 
two famous Vrancic people. There was the Ca
rdinal, and then there was an inventor, a 
fairly famous inventor by that name , and then the mother™s family was called Svagel, and 
they were nobility, mi nor nobil
ity, nevertheless, they had the 
PL, which is the approval of 
a _______ in their name , and the silver has 
that and so on. And they established 
themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who 

rema rried. They all died fairly young, not the ch
ildren necessarily, some  yes, but fairly Œ 
sort of as teenagers or young people, and 
as my memory goes, there were only two 
survivors and they were alrea
dy in their fairly old age. One of them was Vika and the 
other was Ludva, and Vika rema ined single a
nd died in the mi ddle of the war, and I 
reme mber her quite well. Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that 

town. He was Œ he had been a ma yor. He was 
a organizer of the sports club. He was the 
organizer of Œ he was the head of the soccer 
club even though he never played soccer. He 
organized everything in that to
wn. He was especially having to do with music. He loved 
music. He played the violin. He organized tw
o different kinds of orchestras. He was the 
heart of that  town in terms of
 any kind of cultural life. When he fell in love with my a unt, 
and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catho
lic fa mily, and my aunt was the daughter of 
the rabbi, not exactly the right combination 
for the times, forever, but certainly not for 
that time. And he was ten years older than sh
e, and they knew each other especially fr om 
the bank because he was a director of a part
 of another bank, and she worked there. And, 
again, I know that only fr om stories. I aske
d him ma ny ti me s afterwards, ﬁSo, why didn™t 
you get ma rried for such a long time ? ﬂ  Because they got ma rried in 1937, I think, or 

1939, I™m not too sure. I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me , ﬁ Wel l, 

she was very happy living with her fa mily, with
 her parents, and I was fine living with 
my sister and my mother. There was no need 
to get ma rried.ﬂ Well, I rather doubted that 

was how it was, but that™s how he always said
 it. But I™m sure that my grandparents did 
not Œ were not thrilled their daughter going w
ith a Catholic person. However, in all the 
pictures of the fa mily for a very long time, 
he™s always present. So, it wasn™t like he 
wasn™t accepted totally, and I 
think by the time the war was 
imminent in Europe, and they 
knew what was happening, they decided to 
get ma rried. So, they got ma rried. They 

actually had to go to Hungary to get ma rried because you coul
dn™t get married in a civil 
ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is
, and neither of them was converting to 
anything. So, they got ma rried in a civil ce
remony. So, the house that we basically had 
lived was the Vrancic house, and then they a
nd my other aunt, the Appler family, decided 
to build a house of their ow
n, but it was within the same  compound, the same  land base. 
So, that™s how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and 

the other one was supposed to be a big two-
story house with a store on the bottom for my 
uncle, a small apar tment in the back, which 
is we ended up living and these people who 
often hid me  lived there, and then there was 
supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and 
that never got finished, of course, before the war. 
  

Q: Is this why there™s a kind of 
confusion in you about where you were? 
  

A: Exactly. 

  

Q: Because everything was so 
close that you can™t reme mber. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
18 
 
A: Exactly, exactly. So, I sort of have memories
 of Vika living by hers
elf in that big house, 
in that one house. We  were living in an 
apartment, and I don™t know
 at one point that 
was. 
  
Q: So, it™s confusing? 

  

A: It™s very confusing as to where I was liv
ing at what time  beca
use we did move around, 
but only within those three houses sort of, a
nd my grandfather, I th
ink, I spent the least 
time there, and of course, I was the youngest 
so that I reme mber that the least, and I 
reme mber the Vrancic house the best , because Vika eventually died during the war, and 

she died I think while my uncle was in c
oncentration camp, and I reme mb er seeing her 
dead, that was more scary than some  of th
e battles because I ran into the house and 
nobody told me  she was dead and there she wa
s. But then once she died and was buried 
and we were always in that house from then
 on, and that™s, you know, I reme mber, that™s 
Œ we were set then in that house from then on. 
  

Q: We have to change the tape.

Tape #3 
  
Q: Do you have any recollection of your Uncle 
Ludva being taken or goi
ng or leaving or not 
being there? 
  

A: Not being there, very mu ch. Being taken aw
ay, no. I must not have been present. But not 
being there, yes. I reme mber that Giza was ve ry sad and very upset much of the time. I 

reme mber that we were allowed to ma ke packages and send them, and I reme mber very 

well that she was ma king packages. I reme mber 
her ma king sort of vats of this roux. This 
was what was being sent, roux. And so you 
Œ you ma de this brown ma ss which would 

then congeal and solidify, and then he would put
 Œ he would use that to put in the water 

to ma ke sort of a soup. 
  

Q: He was where? 

  

A: He was in Jasenovac. He was Jasenovac, and 
eventually when he would return Œ luckily I 
found out, I mean, he wa s lucky that he return
ed, but he saw my father there. So, my 
father was there for also for quite awhile. 
He was taken with a number of other non-Jews 
from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can™t 
reme mber for how long, but at least a year, I 
think, and I don™t know why, I™ve forgotten, but cer
tainly I talked to 
him afterwards,but I 
don™t have a good me mo ry of how long he was ther
e. But I do know all 
the stories he told 
me  when he returned of how and why he su
rvived, and basically they found out that Œ 
well, they knew Œ that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in 

Jasenovac to balance their books, 
to work on the books, and so th
at he didn™t have to be 
out in the rain and snow and people, ther
e was one person in the office who was an 
Ustashe but not one of those Œ not one of
 those that went around killing people 
necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him.
 In fact, after the war, I have definite 
me mories of Stricek sending packages to hi
m because later on, he was in jail, I mean, 
yeah, in jail for many years after the war. But 
this is so Œ the one thing that saved him 
was that. The other thing that saved him wa
s that he was always, as I told you, an 
organizer of things cultural,
 and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have 
entertainment. So, he organized a chorus, 
and he collected anybody that he knew. So, 
there were so me  nieces of his Œ second niece beca
use he didn™t have br othe rs and si sters, 
cousins, two cousins™ daughters were there 
Œ he collected all th
ese people and they 
created a chorus. So, of course, 
he claime d to have to practice
 if they wanted to have a 
good performa nce. So, t hat saved them also 
from having to work so hard, and they™d 
someti mes allow them access to some more food. He said my father, on the other hand, 

worked very hard. Nevertheless, my fa
ther survived until
 the very end. 
  

Q: Hedid? 

  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: But didn™t your father sing?  So, how
 come  he didn™t get into the chorus? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
20 
 
A: Well, he, yeah, he ma y have, but that™s Œ 
I think, in fact, he di
d, but there were people 
that they didn™t want to Œ that di dn™t allow 
them to be collected because people who were 
young and strong, they ma de them work. I think 
that my Œ Stricek reme mb ers my father 
working with bricks, and carrying stones and 
bricks and things, but he was much, mu ch 
younger. Stricek at that point, he
 was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of 
people who were dying with weak lungs at a 
mome nt™s notice, and he was Œ he would 
have never ma de it. So, anyway, at one point, 
they released that group and they all came  
back to Ludbreg. 
  

Q: Now, was that surprising? 

  

A: Yes and no. I was very surprise d at that fo
r much of my life until ve ry recently when I 
was working on the Jasenovac files. 
  

Q: At the Holocaust Museum?  

  

A: Yes, at the Holocaust Museum, and I found 
out that that was Œ that was very much a 
norm, that a lot of people especially those w
ho were not Jews or Serbs, but were Croats 
who were just thought to be Partisan sympat
hizers and so on, that they were comi ng and 
going. There are ma ny testimonies that I have li
stened to now, and mu
ch material that I 
had seen, that people would sa
y that they were release
d, and even Magda, we were 
talking to Magda. She was saying how people 
were collected to a camp in Zagreb and 
they were released to go home  and get their 
clothes or some thing, and it seems that while 
they were extremely cruel, within Ja se novac, 
that  they were also 
very disorganized, and 
some ti me s people would come  and go and they
 were constantly sending people from one 

place to another. I believe that was the most
 a maz ing thing that I found in reading the 
Jasenovac ma terial, to what extent people were
 constantly being moved fr om Radiska to 
Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trai
ns going back and forth, some times being 
released. It™s amazing, and we haven™t quite
 figured out. Lucie and I are both very 
surprised, and we haven™t quite figured out what 
is the ba sis of that except that we feel 
that there wa s not a total organization. 
  

Q: Now, did your uncle come  b
ack before Giza was deported? 
  

A: Yes,yes. 

  

Q: They were able to spend some  ti me  together. 

  

A: Spend some  time together, but then I don™
t know why he wasn™t Œ I don™t know where 
exactly he was physically when somebody Œ when some body came to get her. She was 

apparently denounced. As I told you, that
 whole town was very good about not 
denouncing anybody, but there was one person, a
nd Stricek knew who that was, and I 
wish for history™s sake that I could reme mb
er his name  now, but I can™t, who denounced 
her, and they came and got her. Some body did warn
 her. I think she hid in the attic of that 
unfinished house, but they found her. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
21 
 
Q: She was denounced as what?  As a sympathizer? 
  

A: As a Jew. 

  

Q: As a Jew?  But wouldn™t she 
have been listed as a Jew? 
  

A: She was, but people weren™t paying that much
 attention to that. She™s on the list because 
the picture I have of 
the list, she™s on it. 
  

Q: They weren™t doing very much with it? 

  

A: No, they weren™t doing anything, but at 
that mo ment, I don™t know whether it was a 
particular person, a particular person who wa
s in charge, even Œ it 
was towa rds the end, 
they were already losing the war. 
  

Q: This was late, this was 1944? 

  

A: It was very late, 1944, right. It
 was very, very late, and then 
Stricek tried to go after her. 
He did go after her. He followed her and 
went all the way to the border and tried 
desperately to get her out, and was unable to
 get her out. We  think that she was shipped 
to Auschwitz, but we don™t know exactly. We  
never found any records, and that was the 
end of her, unfortunately. 
  

Q: When he came back, did you stay with him?  

  

A: Yeah, I stayed with him. I stayed with him.
 That was pretty much already almost the end 
of the war. And– 
  

Q: But your brother™s with you the whole time? 

  

A: Yes, my brother™s with me  all 
the time . And, then came liberation. 
  

Q: Let me  ask you some thing. You™re now a little bit older. You™re like five. 

  

A: Right. 

  

Q: In 1944. So, as people are leaving and Gi
za is clearly an important person to you, you 
have some  s e nse of who she is, her disappearance, does that–? 
  

A: That was very upsetting. 

  

Q: Does that bother you in a way that the 
others would not becaus
e you were so little? 
  

A: Yeah, they all bothered me  that they woul
d be going away. I just didn™t know how going 
away, you know, what Œ you know, you go away, 
you come  back. I think with her, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
22 
 
already had a sense that perhap
s she won™t come  back, that bad things were going on, that 
people die. I think at that point, I- 
  
Q: Do you think you understood what death was? 

  

A: I think, well, yeah, I™ve seen 
Œ I saw a lot of death since then
, all the battles, all the dead 
people. You know, living nights Œ oh, I didn™t 
tell you about one night when there was a 
big battle and the big mill which was just a littl
e bit more than a block fr om us was set on 
fire by the Pa rtisans. That was awful. Pe
ople cryi ng because Œ all over the street  Œ 

because everything, all the wheat 
or corn, whatever they ha d th
at was to sustain them for 
the year  was in the mill ready to be milled and it all burned down. The smell in the town 

for a long time , the s mell hung around of this burnt stuff, and people who were, you 

know, I, at the point, I underst
ood Œ I understood what it means to
 die, or to be dead. So, I 
reme mber being upset, and I reme mb er St
ricek being very upset for a long time 

afterwards. 
  

Q: Did he say anything to you?  Does he 
tell you that he has tried to find her? 
  

A: Yes,yes. 

  

Q: He did. At that time ?  

  

A: I think so, Again, you know, do I remember it th
en, or do I reme mber it 
a year later or in 
1956?  It is very hard to tell, but I th
ink I had the sense of what was going on. 
  

Q: Was he a loving person to you? 
  
A: Very, very, he was one of the sweetest peop
le that you could imagine. Not only to me , he 
was Stricek, which is dimunitive [sic] for uncle
, to the entire town, and because I called 
him that, everybody called him that. He is re
ferred to as Stricek Ludva by everybody, and 
there is Œ there is a monograph, well, there 
is a history of Ludbreg published by a Mrs. 
Wi nter, and it came out about two years ago, and 
there are sections on 
a variety of topics 
including Jews of Croatia, oh, Jews of Ludbre
g, but there is a few people have their own 
chapter, and there is a chapter on hi m with pictures, and it™s 
Nas Stricek Ludva
, which 
means ﬁOur Uncle Ludvaﬂ, that™s what he 
was. Our house was always open and full of 
people and company and he was Œ he was Œhe was the most loving person you could 

imagine. I was extremely lucky, extremely lucky. 
  

Q: Wa s Giza like that, too?  

  

A: She was mu ch quieter. He was, you know- 

  

Q: He was the social one. 

  

A: He was the social one, yeah. She was much
 quieter, and, of course
, she Œ I only knew her 
in really bad times, where I knew him afterwards
, after the war, when 
his true self came  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
23 
 
forth, you know?  So, it™s interesti
ng because one of the things th
at this Mrs. Wi nters says, 
she says, ﬁAll the good things–ﬂ, she was, by 
the way, very fa mous, a very well-known 
person in the Partisans during the war, and sh
e considered he rself a hist orian, and I am 
sorry, very sorry that she died before I coul
d talk to her because  she writes very nice 
things including about him, including the fact 
that he adopted me  a
nd my brother after the 
war, and then she says things like, in one sent
ence she says that even
 that was not, that he 
lost so much during the war, and then in the e
nd he even lost  me because I married this in 

quotes: ﬁrich Jewﬂ, which ma de me  just wr
inkl e because my husband was anything but 
rich, and that I left and left him there, whic
h of course wasn™t the case. Yes, I left, but 
very much with his Œ with his approval, a
nd he knew he was quite elderly and he knew 
that he wanted me  to have as good a life as 
I possibly could. And he 
did everything in his 
life to ma ke my life as good as possible. 
  

Q: So, do you reme mber lib
eration as liberation? 
  

A: Yes, yes, I do. 

  

Q: What was it like? 

  

A: What I reme mber most is columns and columns of Ustashe being ma rched through the 
town and being taken who knows where, and 
all of us standing out
side and looking at 
these people and these forced ma rches that 
they we re on. I don™t know where they were 
going and to where they were going, and ther
e wasn™t anybody that knew, but everybody 
sort of standing around and these people were 
hungry and they were thirsty and here and 

there people gave them a little water, but other 
than that, people just stared as they were 
walking by, and so all of a sudden the tables
 were reversed and everybody was saying, 
ﬁThey deserve it.ﬂ And that is what I re
me mber most is this, you know, the conquered 
people walking by. 
  

Q: Were they yelling at them? 

  

A: I don™t remember yelling. I thi
nk, in fact, there was qu
ite a lot of silence, sort of, we were 
just staring at them. There were huge numb
er, there were thousands of people being 
ma rched by, what looked to me  like thousands. 
  

Q: Were they going north? Do you have any recollection? 

  

A: They were going Œ I reme mber which way they were going in Ludbreg, and they were 
going east. 
  

Q: East? 

  

A: East. So, because I mean, we were between
 Œ Ludbreg is between two larger towns, 
Koprivnica and Varazdin, and Varazdin™s to 
the west, and Koprivnica to the east, and 
they were going across the bridge, across th
e river toward Koprivnica. What happened 
after that, I don™t know, but you know, that was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
24 
 
  
Q: But, you knew from your war game s at the very least- 

  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: Who was the enemy and who wasn™t. 

  

A: Oh, boy did we know who was the enemy all of the time, yes. We knew who the enemy 
was. We  we re free when the Partisans were 
there. You know, I didn™t 
have to pretend. At 
anytime that the Ustashe were in char ge of th
e town, I had to Œ well, I had this red hair, 
flaming red hair. I was extremely noticeable be
cause there isn™ t a Croat almost anywhere 
with red hair. 
  

Q: Only Jewish Croats? 

  

A: Yes, I did not know any red heads, and so 
there was a time that Pavelic came to town. I 
think it was towards the end some time, I don™
t know exactly why he was invited Œ he was 

a speaker. Well, all my friends were going. I 
wa nted to go too, to see, and I was told 
absolutely not, and I remember that I was to
ld I could look Œ we had a stone fence, and I 
could look across the stone fence, peer out. It
 was in the summe rti me I think, but I had to 
wear a hat on my head because you don™t want
 any strangers not noticing you with this 
red hair, and my brothe
r also had red hair.  
  

Q: I was going to ask you if he had red hair. 

  

A: Yes, the two of us had red hair, and we ke
pt waiting for some one in the family to have 
red hair, but my grandson has s
light ly reddish, but it™s my Œ the males in my fa mily seem 
to have red beards, but I™m th
e only redhead female so far. 
  

Q: It was really flaming red? 

  

A: Yeah, very red hair yeah. So, that was a 
real liability, and peasant wome n would come  
into town and tell me  horrible stories. I 
reme mber one telling me, one ti me Œ I don™t 
know if it was during the war or not, but I 
reme mber she told me , ﬁIf you ever go to 
Varazdinﬂ, the bigger town, ﬁbe veryﬂ, or Za
greb, my goodness, ﬁbe very careful not to 
go near any kind of a place where there is
 a pharmacy because, you know, they mi ght 
catch you and press you and ma ke medicine out
 of you.ﬂ You know, there were Œ in the 
small towns, these kind of prejudices and mi
sinforma tion are rampant. So, I knew that 
my red hair was some  ki nd of a liability and I 
was to hide it all time
s, and I hated it, too. 
  

Q: You didn™t like it? 

  

A: I did not like it at all. I just hated it. I 
felt like, ﬁOkay, so ma ybe I™m redhead because  I™m 
Jewish, I™m different.ﬂ And, I didn™t like be
ing Jewish. I me a n, it was a liability, and 
anyway, at that point, I really di
dn™t know that Jewish was anyway. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
25 
 
Q: But, you knew Jewish was bad in terms of the 
Us tashe, not in terms of being Croatian, or 
could you not ma ke that distinction? 
  
A: I don™t think I could ma ke that distin
ction. Again, you know, I knew that this was 
some thing that they could catch me  for and I 
would be in trouble, but no one told me , you 
know, no one told me  why it was bad being Jewish, or why it was Œ or ma ybe if they told 

me  I did not understand or I didn™t understa
nd, but I just knew that nobody ever said bad 
things to me  about it. No one said, ﬁOh, you™re
 a Jew, thereforeﬂ or ﬁit™s bad.ﬂ I me an I 

knew from being in school, we had to go to c
hurches in school. I just started school. I 
was, really, in first grade before the wa r, 
and we had to go to church on Sunday and we 
would line up and go to church, and I knew th
at I didn™t know some  of their songs. I was 
inventing. I reme mber inventing songs. They
 would be singing some thing like, and I 
knew the me lodies but I someti mes didn™t know
 the words, and I would be inventing 
some thing about birds singing or some thi
ng. But, you know, I lived across from the 
church, and I™d go there with my friends. And 
I knew very Œ I knew very early that Jews 
Œ that there were Jews who killed Jesus, and 
that that was bad, and I didn™t want to be 
part of that. But that™s what I knew, and I di
dn™t have any idea afte
r the war what Jewish 
was, but of course, after the war, it didn™t ma tter because nobody followed any religion 

after the war. 
  

Q: Were you asked or trained in some  way to 
be a little Catholic gi
rl so that in case- 
  

A: Mm-h mm.  

  

Q: So, did you go to catechism?  

  
A: Oh,yes. 
  

Q: Youdid? 

  

A: Mm-hmm, but we had it in school. We had it in
 school the first year that I was in school, 
we had catechism in school, which is intere
sting because before the war, there was Œ 
there was Œ religion was taught apparently in 
schools, and I have this picture of my 
grandfather teaching Jewish children, and then
 there was Œ there was a Russian Œ there 
was an Orthodox priest teaching whatever. 
There were Orthodox children, there were 
Serbian children, and then there was the Cat
holic priest, but of course, during the war 
there was only Catholic, but I don™t reme mber
 so much any priests. Some how I™ve don™t 
Œ but, I Œ I do reme mber the book of catech
ism in school. I don™t reme mbe r  who was 
teaching it. 
  

Q: Was this after Giza was taken? 

  

A: That I can™t tell. That I can™t reme mb er. 

  

Q: Do you think it was when you we
re five years old or six? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
26 
 
A: It must have been at the same ti me. I 
did not go to school at five. In Croatia, in 
Yugoslavia, you didn™t go to school until you we
re seven, and they smuggled me into 
school early. I don™t know why. 
I think my uncle felt like,
 ﬁWhat are you doing here?  
She™s already starting to read, 
let her to go to school.ﬂ A
nd because of his position in 
town, or their position in town, and we were fr
iends with all the teacher
s, they just  let me 
go. I was the youngest as it is even when I finished school later on. I was the youngest, 
yeah. 
  

Q: Did you like church? 

  

A: I liked church because it was sort of like
, there wa s music and pomp and circumstance, 
you know, there, you know, you got dressed up a nd there were holidays, but I don™t know 

so much, I mean, you know, because I reme mber girls havi ng to get dr essed up and you 

would go in a procession and throwing rose petals around. 
  

Q: Now, did you go to synagogue when you
™re at grandfather™s? Do you remember? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Nosynagogue. 

  

A: Idon™tremember. 

  

Q: Right, so, your physical experien
ce with religion is Catholicism.  
  

A: Yes, as a child, yes. 
  
Q: You know that you™re Jewis
h, but it™s not your experience. 
  

A: Right. That was not my experience until I 
was 16 years old, but, of course, I had no 
experience with any, you know, and I knew w
ho Œ I mean, I knew who I was because I 
had my own Œ my grandfather™s books we
re saved. Again, I don™t know exactly who 
must have been Ludva Vrancic™s teacher 
who some how fac ilitated for the books, the 
main books, to be taken out of the synagogue 
that my grandfa t her built, lived, and being 
brought to the Vrancic household and being put
 in the attic. So, that is how I end up 
having a lot of my grandfathe
r™s books, not my grandfather™
s, but the synagogue™s books, 
some  of my grandfather™s books. So, they we
re all stored there. So, I knew, you know, 
what Hebrew looked like, and that, but that
 was the language that was used. I have 
pictures of my grandfather, you know, weari
ng different kind of clothes. I reme mber 
things like my Aunt Gi za when one time wh
en we escaped together, be cause there wa s 
going to be a raid and we went
 to another town to the town of Varazdin, and I reme mber 
that she wasn™t going to eat in 
that house. I used to eat, but 
she opened a can of sardines. I 
reme mber that so well. I don™t know why. I re
me mber her can of sardines. So, she was 
obviously keeping kosher. 
  

Q: Kosher. In some  way. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
27 
 
  
A: Yeah. But, you know, I was, you know, I was eating everything everywhere. When I 
think about eating, the thing that I reme mber 
the best is when I was staying with the 
Runjak family, some times when the Ustashe we
re there, and we stayed Œ Mr. Runjak was 
a painter. I don™t mean art. I mean walls. A
nd she was a nurse. She took care of cataracts. 
Everybody seemed to have cataracts, not catar
acts, I™m sorry, trachoma. There was a lot 
of trachoma, and she was- 
  

Q:  What ™ s t h at? 

  

A: It™s Œ trachoma  is a, I th
ink it™s also the word in Englis
h, but it™s a disease of the eye. 
  

Q: Glucoma?  

  

A: No, no, not glaucoma . We have to look that 
up, but I think it™s trachoma, and I think it™s Œ 
it™s a transmittable di sease and 
a lot of peasants had it, a
nd she was Œ she had a little 
clinic of sorts that she ran and they all came 
to her for her to take 
care of the eyes, but 
there was very little money in that family. I mean, there were three, you know, three 

teenage kids. I think one, or ma ybe two of 
them still surviveand 
I see them when I go 
back, and so, food was precious, right?  Though 
I was never hungry, re
ally hungry at all. 
That come s from living in the village wher
e everybody had land and chickens and things, 
but I reme mber that Mr. Runjak because he 
was going to work, he could have scrambled 
eggs for breakfast, and we all had to take 
turns, who was going to 
get the empty pan and 
a piece of bread to eat Œ to rub the bread in 
the fat and eat it, or maybe have a crumb or 
two of the egg left. I reme mber that very well. 
  
Q: Okay why don™t we stop the tape?

Q: When there was liberation, were
 you expecting Giza to come  back? 
  

A: People were Œ I don™t know what I expect
ed, but everybody kept asking me  this question. 
Like, you would be on the street, and some
 stranger would come  and say, ﬁAre you 
expecting your mother and father to come  
back?ﬂ Lots of people asked me  that question, 
and not only at the time of liberation, but
 much later on, and people would concoct 
stories, you know, and say, well, they heard so
-and-so was in Russia for such-and-such a 
time, and they returned, and am I expected some body to come back?  And I ma y have 

expected some body to c o me  back, but not terrib
ly actively. So me  people, of course, came  
back. Two of my uncles returned, but 
of all the family, that™s all.  
  

Q: And did they want to adopt you? 

  

A: Yes, they came  to Ludbr eg looking for me , looking to Œ not just for me ; looking to see 
who was there, who survived of my mothe
r™s family. One of them was my mother™s 
brother. He™s the only one actually of the en
tire Deutsch family who survived. On my  
father™s side of the fa mily, a few siblings 
survived, half of them. And this uncle, my 
Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives 
in Israel, he survived because he was 
prisoner of war. He remained Œ he wa s in
 the Yugoslav Army, and became  prisoner Œ 
actually, Erne  was also pr isoner of war. They both were in the army. They became 

prisoners of war, and so survived. It was a mu
ch easier survival from what Œ I just spoke 
to Bernard very recently and he was telling me
 stories, how they basically lived the same  
way like the rest of the prisoners of war, a
nd they were able to get packages and they 
were fed reasonably decently, et
 cetera, et cetera. So, the tw
o of them returned. Both of 
them asked me to go with them, and I absolu
tely refused. Wh en I think about, at the age 
of seven, I was totally aghast
 that I would go with these 
people whom I didn™t know. And 
my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got ma rried to anothe
r survivor, this survivor of the camps, to 
Estie (ph), she survived Auschwitz. They left
 Yugoslavia, and went to France, to the 
south of France, and then eventually to Israel
 where they still live. My other uncle, Erne, 

got rema rried. His wife, Irma (ph), and daught
er, Edita (ph), were 
killed. By the way, 
that™s one of my really vivid me mories Œ hi
s daughter was at one 
point released from a 
concentration camp, and I reme mber her comi ng to my grandfather™s house and being 

totally skin and bones, full of 
lice, and I reme mb er that she 
looked weird, and they put tar 
on her head, and she just looked so crazy to 
me . And I was, obviousl
y, a little girl, and 
again, she then continued to 
live in Ludbreg and not in to
tal and absolute Anne Frank-
style hiding, and then she was taken away ag
ain. But, anyway, she then wa s taken away 
and was killed. But he rema rried, Erne re
married, and married a woman who became a 

widow and had two children, and they eventual
ly left for Israel, and I rema ined behind. I 
think that from the date of the adoption Œ I was adopted by my uncle, and my brother 

also, almost imme diately after the war in ™46. 
  

Q: This is before the came Œ before the brother- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
29 
 
A: I have a feeling that it wa s before they 
came, and so, you know, there was a great tug of 
war, and I never heard from either for a very 
long time. I think they
 were very angry and 
upset. 
  
Q: Now, were they angry at
 you?  They were angry at-? 
  

A: Well, they were angry at my uncle, but it Œ 
it manifested itself with the fact that I never 
heard from them again. However, the person th
at I did hear from eventually, but I don™t 
reme mber how soon after the war, I heard fr
om a nother uncle who 
survived, another of 
my father™s brothers. So, in my father™s fam
ily, there were six children, and one sister and 
two brothers survived, and this one brother 
was in Bergen-Belsen and then was rescued 
out of Bergen-Belsen and went to Switzerla
nd, and he ma rried Magda, and they had one 
child a seven-year-old child or so when I he
ard from the m. So, ma ybe he was Œ ma ybe he 

was about five, six at the time. So, it must ha
ve been, I think that child was born sort of 

™45, ™46. So, I heard sort of into the ‚50s
 more or less continually from them, and 
reme mber very vividly getting a package fr
om the m, a ball point pen where you could see 
through the plastic. That was so exciting, and 
a red plastic little purs
e like that, and a box 
of Frigor chocolates, my  box of 
Frigor chocolates, very exciting. 
  

Q: Frigor? 

  

A: Frigor, the Swiss brand. They were living 
in Switzerland. Of course, we had no Œ after 
the war we had so little, and we, as a fa mily, had more. I me an Stricek and I and my 

brother, ha d more than many fa milies. But, anyway, this whole chocolat es and stuff came  

much later. It came after my br
other was no longer in the house. 
  
Q: Let™s talk a little bit ju
st about this tragedy with- 
  
A: Withmybrother? 

  

Q: With your brother. 

  

A: Now, there we were having survived the 
war, and it was September and everything was 
going fine, and it was time to go and have Œ and 
collect grapes, have a grape harvest, and 
we were at the grape harvest, and the day afte
r my brother was sick, and it just seemed to 
be sick like children get sic
k. And then his tempe r ature went up and up and up, and then 
it turned out that two other children in town 
apparently had scarlet fe
ver, and it turned out 
it was scarlet fever, but it rea
lly wasn™t diagnosed in time, 
and Œ in time for the doctor to 
say, ﬁGo to the nearest town,ﬂ which was 
25 kilome ters from us, or ﬁLet™s go get 
penicillin some place,ﬂ and apparent ly he had a weak heart, and he was sick for three da ys 

and he died. It was quite a 
tragedy. It was a tragedy for 
me , even then, and I was old 
enough to realize it, I don™t think I wa s nearly as affected
 as Stricek was. I don™t think he 
ever got over his death. He just
 adored that child. He adored 
me , too, but I think he really 
adored my brother. And I was Œ the w
hole town mourned. It was really sad. 
  

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
30 
 
  
A: Yeah. It was very sad. It was just, you know
, I think scarlet fever 
is a bad disease even 
now, and at that time I think there was just 
no Œ we had no antibiotics.
 It was right after 
the war, and nobody was alert enough to realize that you could die that fast from 

some thing like that, you know?  You just go, ﬁOh,
 the kid is sick. He has a high fever.ﬂ 
So, it was bad. It was tragic. So, after that,I was an only child, and with not a single 

blood relative rema ining within Yugoslavia. So- 
  

Q: Did you feel almost like Ludva
 was as good as a blood relative? 
  

A: Oh, yeah. I never Œ no, I™m only ma king a stat
ement, a general statement, but it wasn™t 
that I felt that he was any different then a 
blood relative. I really 
felt like he was my 
father. And the only time  that I used to 
think how sad it was that I didn™t have my 

parents, and I know that sounds terrible 
because people often ask me  that, you know, 
ﬁHow did you feel about your parents?ﬂ but, 
because I didn™t know them, and I didn™t 
have that experience, it was only theoretically
 that I mi ssed my parents. Aunt Magda gets 
very upset when I say that. 
  

Q: It ma kes perfect sense. 

  

A: It ma kes sense. The only time that I would, you know, feel sorry for mys e lf, was when 
some thing would happen that I would get pun
ished for some thing, and then I would say, 
ﬁIf my mother were alive she wouldn™t 
do XYZ,ﬂ you know, like I don™t know. If we had 

succession of cleaning ladies and housekeeper
s. We had some very nice housekeepers, 
some  people who were very nice to me . But if
 I would get punished or had to clean my 
room or wha t ever I had to do, I would say, ﬁI
f my mother was alive, I wouldn™t have to 
be doing this.ﬂ Of course, I would have. 
  

Q: Yes, would you say that out loud? 

  

A: No, but I would think that to 
myself, feeling sorry for myself. 
  

Q: Now, you said at some  point this afternoon, th
at your father actually 
survived the war. Is 
that the case? Or up to
 the end of the war? 
  

A: From what I was told by people Œ a person 
who apparently witnessed my father™s death, 
is that at the end Œ at the end of Jase
novac, there were ma ny outbreaks. There was a 
major one at one point. I keep r
eading about that in 
all the records. But, apparently, there 
was confusion and they were killing peopl
e en ma sse and so, people were trying to 
escape and there was Œ it seems that my father
 and a few other people 
escaped at the very 
end, and that they went some place into the w
oods, and then came  down Œ came close to a 
village looking for the food, a
nd that they were surprised 
by a German, I think, German 
patrol, or Ustashe patrol, I™m not sure. A
nd, then he was shot. So, that™s the most 
unfortunate, that he was able to survive 
until the very end, and then not ma ke it. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470

Q: This is going to sound like an odd questi
on, but do you think that if your parents had 
come  back, you would have felt about them th
e way that you did about the two brothers 
who ca me ?  Just like, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ 
  
A: Possibly, but I think I unde
rstood parents. I understood - 
  

Q: Youunderstood? 

  

A: Yeah, I understood the concept. I unders
tood that, and I think 
Stricek would have 
understood and would have Œ would have give
n me  a way. Yeah, given me  a way, I me an, 
he could have kept me . You know, I was, to hi
m,  basically a grandchild because my aunt 

Œ my aunt, who was his wife, as I said, was 
15 years older, then he was 10 years older 
than my aunt. So, there was a 25 year gap. 
  

Q: Between your parents and him?  

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So, how old do you think he was at the end of the war? 

  

A: So, he was born in 1885. I™m very bad at ma th.  

  

Q: So, he™s 45 or 50? 

  

A: In his 50s, right, and so Œ oh, when did I 
feel sorry for myself for not have had my 
parents? For example, he was fairly strict
. When I was a very little child, I could do 
anything. I could climb walls if I 
wanted to, but as I got older 
and older, then restrictions 
rema ined, you know. I had to be careful about 
this and that, and boys and so on, and then 
I was always Œ I would always say, ﬁ Well, 
you see, he™s so old, he doesn™t understand 

anything. If I had younger pare
nts, they would have unders
tood.ﬂ Nonsense, of course, 
but, you know, that™s Œ it™s a good way of looking 
at it. So, I always used to say, ﬁI™m 
going to have my children very young so that
 I™ll understand them better.ﬂ We ™d have to 
ask my children how I did. I did have my ch
ildren very young, but I don™t think that that 
was necessarily what happened, but I alwa
ys worried about hi m getting married, for 

example. 
  

Q: And what would happen? 

  

A: And what would happen, and there was some  
possibilities. We had so
me very appropriate 
housekeepers at time s. 
  

Q: What did you think would happen?  Th
at they would not want you there? 
  

A: No, no, no, I didn™t think 
that. I was just jealous. 
  

Q: You liked having him to yourself? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
32 
 
  
A: Oh, yes, you know, I was in charge.  

  

Q: When you think back now, does it surprise you that some one who is 55 years old would 
want to adopt a little gi rl? 
  

A: Well, I don™t - 

  

Q: Or, was he just very special? 

  

A: He was just very special. I Œ I don™t thi
nk, I™ve never thought about 
it in that way. Of 
course, if I think now, I find a 55 Œ I mean, I 
remained a widow at the age of 54. That™s 
about the same  age, and I certa
inly wouldn™t think about starti
ng at this point to adopt a 
child. So, I can imagine that age very much, but
 I think I was there a
ll along. It was just, 
you know, it was just a paper thing. It wasn™t 
a Œ it was just continuing status quo rather 
than creating some thing new. 
  

Q: Clearly, he loved Giza so much and the fa
mily, that there was no way that he was going 
to abandon you. 
  

A: No. 

  

Q: Or your brother. 

  

A: No, no, no, I was just part of them. 

  
Q: And, he Œ from your descripti
on, he was such a social person - 
  
A: Right,right. 

  

Q: That privacy was not the big issue for him.  

  

A: Oh, it wasn™t an issue at all. There was 
no privacy in that house. No, there was some body 
there from morning, noon ‚til night, there were
 always people in th
e house, and there was 
always something being served. And people we
re always visiting. So, that wasn™t an 
issue. 
  

Q: Did he tell you about your parent
s, what he reme mbered about them? 
  

A: He told me , but he didn™t 
know my parents all that well. 
  

Q: Hedidn™t? 

  

A: No, I mean, he knew Œ he knew my mother, 
but he barely knew my father, because  my 
parents were ma rried about two years or so wh
en I was born, and my father never lived in 
Ludbreg, and Stricek never lived in Zagre
b. So, I mean, you know it was Œ he knew my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
33 
 
mother as a young woman growing up, and she 
was away at school, of course, because 
there was, you know, in Ludbreg, there were 
only eight grades of school, and so, my 
mother already was sent to Cakovec to go to 
school at the age of 13 or 14, whenever it 
was. So, I™m sure he didn™t know her all that 
well to be able to tell me  very much about 
her. I mean, there were always things he to
ld me . I me an, mus i c was extremely i mportant 
to him. I was always told I needed to study music, and my mother sang very well 
apparently. So, that was always
 told me . I was always told that she was very good with 

languages, which I inherited some how and also 
I could sing, so that was always, ﬁThat™s 
what you have from your mother.ﬂ Well, both 
my parents. My mother lived in Cakovec 
for a bit of time , and apparently learned Hunga
rian while she was there, just as a side 
thing. So, it was a big thing, you know. To 
study languages was very important, and I 

was always given all the opportunities, but
, you know, I was given a lot of opportunities 
and I was aware of that because we lived 
surrounded by in this world of farms and 
farming fa milies, and ther e were very few so-called ﬁintellectualsﬂ families in town, and 

you know, I was one of those, and I had more 
than most people, and I was ma de aware, 
you know, of, you know, 
noblesse oblige
, and I had to behave well, and I was told I had 
to learn how to do things in the house, so that
 I can tell ma ids what to do, those kinds of 
things. So, I knew I sort of lived in sort of 
semi -privileged world, and I enjoyed it all. I 
liked to learn, and I, you know, there were 
books everywhere, and for fun I was reading 
Dante™s Trilogy. I love to look at 
the pictures of the Inferno. 
  

Q: It must have remi nded you of the war? 

  

A: Yeah.[Laughs.] 

  

Q: How does he earn a living? 
  
A: He was back to being a bank director. 

  

Q: Oh, he was. So, he was doing very we ll? 

  

A: Yeah. We ll, you know, in that world, compar
atively. Yes, we Œ we still had, of course, 
our house, and then we were Œ there were Œ 
he was constantly working on getting some  
of the other things back, like th
e vineyard was left  to us, but,
 of course, that was always 
an outlay of money, because we had to pa
y some body to work it and then nobody ever 

sold anything practically. We  only sold wood 
Œ there was a little fore
st and we could sell 
wood and gravel, and then there was stuff in th
e house that we were able to sell. There 
was jewelry left from be fore the war, and slowly
 we sold quite a bit of that. I have a very 
vivid me mo ry of taking some  chains which I 
liked very much, gold chains, and having to 
Œ somebody came and put them on the scale, and 
that was the money. But, that is how Œ 
oh, and there were clothes from his s i sters 
and so on that we slowly sold, and extra 
furniture, and we traded for things like pot
atoes and whatever, you know, else we needed 
to live. 
  

Q: What happened in terms  of religio
n? Wa s he an observant Ca tholic? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
34 
 
A: No. 
  

Q: Nothing. 

  

A: No. He was not an observant Catholic, but
 I don™t reme mber him ever going to church. 
There was some times things that we did do in
 the house. I reme mber that we did have a 

Christmas tree, mainly because the maids or
 the housekeepers or whoeve r they were put 
one up, and I would, of course, couldn™t help 
but love it, and I™d get presents. And, the 
only other thing that I have a me mor y of be
sides that holiday, was that the day Œ Three 
Kings Day, whatever it™s called now. You know, 
it™s the last day of Christmas, after 
Christma s. The custom in Ludbreg was for th
e priest to come  through the houses and do - 
  

Q: Bless? 

  

A: Yeah, bless the house and put some  chalk 
ma rks, I think, I think, of the saints or 
some thing like that on the Œ and, of cour
se, Stricek, who was very welcoming of 
everybody, allowed the priest to come , too. S
o, the priestcame . We
 sat down. We had a 
good talk, and religion at that time was so
 frowned upon. No one went to church 
anymore, and that priest was sort of, you know
, he didn™t push it. Th
at was the only thing 
that happened. 
  

Q: And, what happened to you knowing that you we re at least born Jewish?  There are very 
few Jews left in Yugoslavia. 
  

A: There was this one fami ly that returned, the We inrebe family, whom I adored and they 
were Stricek™s best friends. But they didn™t 
do anything either, and 
so, I just knew that 
they were Jewish and what had happened duri
ng the war, and eventu
ally, their daughter, 
the younger daughter, is five year
s older than I am. So, when 
Œ and, she wasn™t living in 
that town. They sent her to Zagr
eb to go to school. So, I saw ve
ry little of her. But as we 
got older, we got closer and 
closer, and still now we™re very
 good friends. I talked to her 
on the phone yesterday. But, I was Œ I was hoping to meet some body bec a use I was 

becomi ng a little curious about th
e whole thing. But, at the age 
of 13, I finished school in 
Ludbreg and I went off to Varazdin to go 
to high school. And there wasn™t a Jew left 
there either that I knew, nobody, nobody in my 
hi gh school. By the time  I got to the 
university, there ma y have been some, but I 
was not aware of it. I reme mber hearing a 
name  that I thought, ﬁWe ll, she mi ght be Jewish,ﬂ but by that time , I had been to 

Switzerland, and that was a whol
e Œ and then all of a sudden, 
I started to understand what 
Jewish me a nt.  
  

Q: Because you went to see the -? 

  

A: Tomyuncle. 

  

Q: To your uncle, and they were Orthodox? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
35 
 
A: They were Orthodox. They were Orthodox. 
I went from like nothing to a totally 
Orthodox household. 
  
Q: Was that comfortable? 

  

A: I was fine with that. I seem to be fine with - 

  

Q: You™reveryflexible. 

  

A: I think I™m a bit. I think that™s
 probably what the war did to me . 
  

Q: Yeah, because you keep changing. 

  

A: Yeah, it™s okay. So, this is the thing now. 

  

Q: So, let me  ask you some t hing about the 
politics. What happens Œ now, there™s a 
Communist regime . 
  

A: There. 

  

Q: There? 

  

A: Yeah,right. 

  

Q: So, you™re living there, right? 

  
A: Yeah. 
  

Q: So, 

  

A: At that time, I mean. 

  

Q: What™s____? 

  

A: So, I™m thinking now, no, not now. 

  

Q: No, but then. 

  

A: Yes, historical present, right. 

  

Q: Historical present. So, are you feeling very ideologi
cally sympathetic? 
  

A: Boy, a m I, yes because this is the pe
ople that won the war. I mean, we are gung-ho 
Partisan. My uncles wearing the, you know, he™s 
a Œ I™m a victim of fascism and so is he. 
  

Q: That was your privilege? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
36 
 
  
A: That gives me some Œ well, 
eventually it gives me Œ it give
s me  the privilege of going to 
Switzerland. I would not have been able to 
go otherwise. No, absolutely not. I mean, 
absolutely not. There are pictures of my 
uncle, you know, wearing a 
red star. I mean, we 
were really very much and that™s how he was 
able to go back to being in a position Œ to 
being in a position of power because he had suffered during the war. So, even though 

they were very strange people that had co
me  to power. I mean, people from outside 
whom we di dn™t know, who weren™t quite as well-educated as we would have liked them 

to have been, but happen to have been in th
e Partisans, and therefore they were assumi ng 
positions of the Chief of Police, et cetera, et
 cetera, but we were very good friends of 

theirs. And, ideologically, we were to that 
side. I mean, I especia
lly, as a young person, I 
think my uncle eventually understood that 
some  of this was not good as time went on 
and, you know, we were under repressed and the 
Russian rule, and so on and so forth. I 
reme mber having fights with him about the Su
ez Canal, which I thought was a wonderful 
thing that it was being taken over by the 
Egyptians, and I reme mber having fights over 
the fact that, you know, I certa
inly thought I would go and build a road between Zagreb 
and Belgrade with the rest of the student body, 
which, of course, he thought that I wa s out 
of my mi nd, and I™m not going anywhere. T
hose kinds of things, but he was, you know, 
he was obviously in favor of the new regime , 
but then the regime  turned out not to be 
exactly what we hoped it™d be. 
  

Q: Now, what did it mean to be a victim - 

  

A: Offascism.  

  

Q: Yeah. 
  
A: It meant that you had been on the, basical
ly, on the side on which you were deprived of 
liber ty or limb or whatever, just  exac tly what
 happened to me. I was a victim of fascism, 
so was he, because he wa s in a concentration camp, and when I wanted to go to 

Switzerland to visit my relati
ves and I applied for the visa
, I was given the visa as a 
victim of fascism because I had suffered, th
erefore I could be  trusted. I was not on the 
wrong side, and therefore could be
 trusted to be given this vi
sa, which was, at that time, 
no one went. When I came back from Switzer
land, I went through every class in my high 

school telling people what it was like. I didn™t know Œ nobody knew anybody who had 

been abroad. Of course, I didn™t tell them a
bout the Jewish parts of it. That was for me . 
  

Q: We have to change the tape. 
 
End of Tape #4 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
37 
 
 
Tape #5 
  
Q: When you came back, after visiting Swit
zerland, and you™re talking to everybody about 
what it was like, but you don™t talk about bei
ng Jewish. Do you then talk to your uncle 
and say, ﬁI want to pursue thisﬂ? 
  

A: No. 

  

Q: You talk to nobody? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: So, this is all in your head? 

  

A: It™s all in my head. I don™t know Œ I don™t know
 what I™m going to do with that. It doesn™t 
really have that much meaning. I mean, it
™s some thing I learned. I learned some thing 
what that was like, being Jewish, but I don™t feel
 like I want to do one 
thing or another. It 
took, you know, I don™t think that at that point
 I wa s considering religion one way or 
another. It wa s just sort of
 a new knowledge, but I didn™t 
think anybody was interested in 
that part. I mean, no one was 
interested in any religion an
yway. I don™t think my uncle 
asked me , I mean, he asked me  anything about that. I mean, he knew. 
  

Q: He knew they were Orthodox? 

  

A: Oh, he knew they were Jewish. I don™t th
ink he knew what it meant to be Orthodox. I 
don™t think Œ I mean, he knew my grand Œ 
obviously he knew my 
grandparents, and you 
know, they were sort of like my grandparent
s. They weren™t Œ anyway, there aren™t 
Orthodox. Well, there was Orthodox by American Œ 
in an American sense. They are not 
orthodox in when you think now of like the Here
di in Israel or some thing like that. I 
mean, they, at that time , mother™s now weari
ng some thing on her head, but at that time, 
she wasn™t. But, they really were observan
t. The me n always wore some t hing on their 
head. They followed all the laws of Kashrut.
 The Shabbat, you didn™t do anything except 
go to the synagogue. And, they lived in a small Orthodox community in Montreux, and 

basically there were no other kinds of Jews. I,
 at that time , I didn™t even know of the 
possibility of other kinds of Jews. It was 
all so sudden, and so out of nowhere with no 
background to speak of. And I was there a month. So, it™s Œ it was sort of - 
  

Q: Now, did he talk a
bout his brother to you? 

  

A: Yeah, they talked a lot about Œ they were Œ 
to this day, they were very much imbued with 
everything that happened during th
e war before the war, talk 
about the family, talk about 
what happened to them during the war, after 
the war. They were still recovering from Œ 
even though to me , it looked like they were 
living in this fairy 
land, their life really 
wasn™t easy at all. But, I only Œ at the ag
e of 16, it™s just so mu ch, you know. I mean, I 
was more impressed with things like, you 
know, you go to a supermarket and the doors 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
38 
 
open by themselves. I mean, you know, that was very important. And all the food, I 
mean, in the supermarkets. And so this was 
still ™54 in Yugoslavia. I me an, you know, we 

had still very little. We  had just eme r ged, sort
 of, from really, not having anything in the 
stores, and you know, we had emerged from
 the time that we were getting UNRRA 
packages, you know, and with crazy foods from 
America, and my me mo
r y of that is all 
of the foods that we couldn™t eat like Œ that 
we didn™t like, like canned orange juice, and 
there were some clothes that
 we got, and I got a sweater 
from school, because there was 

piles of things, and I brought home this sw
eater, and my uncl e  ma de me  t a ke it back, 
because we weren™t as poor as other peopl
e who could have this sweater. And I™m to 
consider other people. I was taught well to 
be compassionate and 
to understand who we 
were, and who I was. So, you know, all of th
at and then all of a sudden comi ng to 
Switzerland and seeing a lot of 
things in the stores, and beautifully arranged shops with 
jewelry and people well-dressed 
walking by Lake Geneva. All of that mi xed in with this 
little thing of Jewishness, it was just too much. 
  

Q: It™s interesting, of course, 
that they were in Switzerland. If
 you™d been in other European 
countries, you™d have seen
 much more devastation. 
  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: So, you saw nothing. 

  

A: I saw nothing. It was all 
perfect, you know, perfect land. Of 
course, there were extremely 
nice to me  and, you know, took me  and my aunt  
tells the story, I think she told it on tape, 
that she reme mbers very well that I Œ she reme mb
ers it better than I do, that at one point, 
we were doing some thing and there was a little 
discussion in the family about what to do, 
and I put my two cents in and I said some th
ing. I said, ﬁOh, I don™t wa
nt to get into it, 
after all I™m not family.ﬂ And they said, ﬁYes
, you are. You™re a me mber of the family.ﬂ 
And I cried. So, there were so ma ny different 
emotions, and so much new to see and learn 
and do. It, you know, and I knew that they were
 concerned about Œ th
ey were concerned 
about my not knowing any other Jews and not
 knowing what Jewish me a nt, and being 
happy that I™m with someone who really cared 
about me . The y understood that, but at the 
same  ti me , they were, you know, I was 16, and 
I think they were mostly worrying about 
who a m I going to ma rry, you know, and how is
 this going to go on, and I™m going to be 
lost to the family forever, and that kind of thing. 
  

Q: Dora, did you some how feel 
closer to them, I don™t know, closer to them than to your 
uncle, but the fact that they
 were blood, did this ma ke 
an i mpression on you that was 
surprising? 
  

A: Yeah, in a way, in a way. I understand what 
you™re saying. It™s not th
at I feel closer to 
them than to my uncle, but the fact that I felt
 close to them was inte
resting to me . It™s not 
that that™s a comparison, but almost total stra
ngers, and I reme mber that my uncle came  
to get me, Uncle Jozi, came to get me at th
e border. I was on the Or
ient Express and just 
comi ng through Simplon, and I was obviously ne
rvous all by myself traveling, and he 
said he would come  and meet me  at the bor
der in Brigg, and I™m 
looking out the window, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470

and I™m thinking, ﬁHow am I going to recognize 
him? ﬂ I had a picture; they sent me  one. 
I had a picture, but how am I going to rec
ognize him, and it was such a feeling when I 
saw him. I knew it Œ first of all, I knew that 
that was him, and I that was a really, very 
special feeling of some overwhelming emoti
onal connection. And, of
 course, after, you 
know, later on when I went to live with them
 for a year, and studied in Switzerland, I 
realized they were really very
 good people, and they did Œ they
 did a lot to enable me  to 
be there. And, of course, Stricek did, t
oo, because it costs money for me  to go. My 
relatives in Switzerland didn™t have any, and 
I didn™t even realize 
that. We all thought, 
you know, just like people who would think mo
ney grows on trees in America, well, you 
know, we all thought, ﬁThere™s lo
ts of money in Switzerland.ﬂ 
We ll, of course, they had 
very little. They had come from a concentr
ation camp and they had nothing, and I lived 
better in ma ny ways where I was. I was able
 to bring my aunt, as a present, a gold 
bracelet.  
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: Yes, because  Stricek felt that we had to 
pay for whatever what I got. So, I got a ticket 
bought and I had the bracelet to give her, and 
had some  toys for the kids. Toys were hard 
to get. I had some  kind of a rubber toy that
 I had bought, because that you couldn™t get in 
Yugoslavia. I had one of the gold br acelets,
 she still ha s it, that I brought her. And, you 
know, so, it was Œ it was a very kind of a stra
nge experience in so ma ny ways. I lost my 
thread. Where was I? 
  

Q: Let me  ask you, was your uncle jealous? 

  

A: My uncle in Croatia? 
  
Q: Yeah. 

  

A: It™s interesting. He was Œ he
 was, I mean, he wa s really a saint in so ma ny ways, but you 
know, he had Œ he had Œ he could not have se
nt me . He could™ve squashed that whole 

relationship. On the contrary, he did send me
, plus he sent me  another time, you know, to 
go and study there for a year. And, then I 
happened to meet my husband on the way, at 
that. 
  

Q: That was the second trip? 

  

A: The second trip, right, and then I wasn™t comi ng back. I was getting ma rried and going to 
America, and through all that, I mean, I have a 
letter which he wrote in which I wrote to 
him that I met my husband, this person that I wa
nt to ma rry, and he, in his letter, said, ﬁIf 
Jozi and Magda think that that
™s okay, then it™s okay with me .ﬂ And that was very 
generous on his part. 
  

Q: Was this your first boyfriend? 

  

A: No, I had other boyfriends. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
40 
 
  
Q: You had other boyfriends. 

  

A: But, they aren™t important. 

  

Q: None of them ma ttered to you in the same  way. 

  

A: No. I mean, yeah, they we re boyfriends
, you know, they were boyfriends, but, you know, 
I was young. I was 19 when I me t my husband. 
  

Q: Yeah, I understand that. So, when did you st
art having boyfriends?  As
 an early teenager? 
  

A: Yeah, as an early teenager, all forbidde
n, all forbidden, constantly fighting with my 
uncle. That™s what I mean when I said, you know, when he was strict, that™s because he™s 

so old, and he doesn™t understand. 
  

Q: It™sinterestinggiven 
his relationshi p with Giza, 
which was also forbidden. 
  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: In a certain way. 

  

A: Yes, well this was sort of has to do with morays of the place. 

  

Q: I see, and you™re a girl. 

  
A: And I™m a girl. I have to be protecte
d, you know, what™s going to happen to me . You 
don™t want to ma rry Œ and the 
business that I was going to 
ma rry this person, and it wa s 
extremely important, and he said it in the lette
r, and I just recently read another letter 
where he me ntions it after the 
children were born, th
at I had promised that I would finish 
school, because here I was fini
shing my sophomore year in 
college and getting ma rried, 
you know. That was not good. I was to finish unive
rsity. I was to be Œ have a profession. 
  
Q: So you could take care of yourself? 

  

A: Yes, so that was the only issue Œ that was
 the
 issue, but I promised, I promised solemnly 
that I would finish school, th
at I would go back to school, and when I came  to the States, 

I thought, oh, God, starting all over again. I starte
d university in Zagreb, first I had a year. 
Then, I started in Switzerland, and I had a ha
rd time  because I was having to study in 
French and I had studied English and German 
before and Russian but very little Fr ench. I 
learned French, and I came  here, and I 
thought, ﬁGoodness, now what? ﬂ  And, so I got 
pregnant inst ead. So, I had my daughter, 
and that was nice because I was someti mes 
feeling lonely. I mean, then, my husband wa
s a super-wonderful person, the very best, 

but I went from one wonderful person who t
ook care of me , to my aunt and uncle in 

Switzerland, to Dan, who could™ve been Œ w
ho was everything that my uncle had been, 
just really nurturing and he was nine years 
older than I and had had his PhD and he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
41 
 
ma rrying this sophomore  who doesn™t know from
 beans and comi ng to this new country. 
So, it was quite an experience to me . And so, some ti me s Œ and there was nobody else 
here Œ so someti mes I was lonely. It was good 
to have my daughter. Then, when, Elliott, 
my son, was born a year and a half later, when
 he started going to school, I did go back to 

school. 
  

Q: Youdid? 

  

A: Yes, I did go back to school, and I di d fini
sh, and I had a long teaching career. So, I did 
accomplish that. 
  

Q: And, when you left Switzerland to come  to
 the United States, how long was it before you 
saw Uncle Ludva again? 
  

A: It was, let me think when I was born in Œ 
I think it was something like six years. I coul d 
not go back earlier because, even if I had ha
d money, because I didn™t Œ did not want to 
return without the American citizenship, ma ybe
 it was less than that, and I applied for it 
as soon as I could, which I was three year
s after I was here. So, I had a year in 
Switzerland, and then I had three years here 
before I could apply, and then it took them a 
year to gi ve it to me because I came from 
a Communist country and we were in the post-
McCarthy era and they investigated me  to
 no end, dema nding why I hadn™t protested 
when I had to join the Communist Youth 
of Yugoslavia. Can you imagine?  If I™d 

protested, I™d be in jail. So - 
  

Q: You were also a kid. 

  
A: I was also a kid, right. So, it took them a y
ear, and as soon as I got it, then I asked for a 
release from the Yugoslav citizenship, which 
I got. Then, I went back because it was still 
very, very difficult to leave the country, and th
en I went to back a
nd went already with 
the two kids and my hus band and it was wonderful. 
  
Q: And is this the first time they™ve me t your husband? 

  

A: He me t my husband, yes. He couldn™t come
 to the wedding. I mean, he could have Œ he 
could have possibly come . He could™ve gotten 
a visa, et cetera, et 
cetera. It would™ve 
taken time . It took me  six months every time  to
 get a visa, but he was really, at that time, 
feeling his age. He was not ever strong part
icularly, and at that point he was barely 
leaving the house anymore, and he really felt
 like he could not leave the house, I mean, 
go on such a trip. And so, he wasn™t at my 
wedding, which of course, was a pity, but it™s 
sad. 
  

Q: It must have been wonderful 
for him to see th
e grandchildren. 
  

A: Yes, yes, yes, that was wonderful. We had a super time . 

  

Q: Didyou? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470  
42 
 
  
A: Yeah, really a good time, and we stay
ed a few months. It
 was really nice. 
  

Q: Really?Fabulous! 

  

A: Yes. Not Dan, but the kids and I did. 

  

Q: So, the kids got a sense. 

  

A: The kids, yes, and Wa nda still has a good 
sense of it. Elliott wa
s a little too young to 
reme mber a lot, but Wa nda, I think, does reme mb er. She was then in kindergarten. 
  

Q: Now, a lot of people think the Holocaus
t changed them. In a way, I suppose you think 
you didn™t go through the Holocaust. 
  

A: Sometimes, yes. It took me a long time to
 understand that I™m a Holocaust survivor. I 
never classified myself as such until very
 recently, when people told me , ﬁOf course you 

are a Holocaust survivor.ﬂ   
  

Q: And, what does that Œ does it mean some thing? 

  

A: Right now, it does. It me ans Œ it mean mo
re and more. I understand Œ I™ve me t now other 
people who didn™t go to camp, and, you know, 
we think of them now as Holocaust 
survivors. I used to think that a Holo
caust survivor me ans some one who has gone 

through a concentration camp, which I was extr
emely lucky not to have gone through. On 
the other hand, how do you define Holocaust?  
There was Holocaust all around me . I just 
have happened to have been at the right pl
ace at the right time, or all the wrong time I 
was in the right place not to 
be swept Œ swept up with the re
st. So, I was just super-lucky 
in every way. 
  

Q: Except for the losses. 

  

A: Except for the losses, people losses. The losses, the losses, yeah. 

  

Q: Even though you were little it was - 

  

A: There™s a sense of loss, and you realize it 
more after I had children, I became  much more 
aware of the losses. And I thi
nk at that point, you can put yourse
lf in the other shoes Œ not 
what it did to me , but what must it have done 
to my mother and my father to have your 
child taken away, to not know what™s going to
 happen to that child, to be stuck some  
place and you don™t know where your children are, whether they™re de ad
 or alive, all of 
that Œ you become  aware of that and internali
ze it, and think of it in a different way. So, 
that™s, you know, that™s Œ you can understand what
 it means to lose a child, and now I can 
understand what it means to lose a spouse, wh
ich is the saddest th
ing for me  right now, 
still. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0470

Q: Dan died in ™54? 
  

A: No, Dan died in ™92. 

  

Q: Oh, I™m sorry in ™92. 

  

A: In ™92, right, and that was a hard loss. 

  

Q: It still is. 

  

A: Yeah, yeah, and that™s a 
kind of loss that I think I can
 understand some times people who 
Œ I was a child, so, I can see the child-paren
t relationship and what it would be like for 
my parents, but then, you know, Stricek 
mourned Giza forever and ever, and I can 
understand that very well. 
  

Q: Now?  

  

A: Yeah, and he mourned my br
other terribly forever. So, late
r on, you realize it, and yeah, I 
suppose, I now understand it what it means to be
 a survivor, and it™s not the easiest place 
either. I think I cope well, but that™s it. 
  

Q: You also seem to have 
enjoyed life in ma ny ways. 
  

A: Yes. I had a very good life in ma ny ways, have good colleagues, good work Œ I love my 
work, I still do. I think Œ I think I™ve had a sort of
 joie de vivre built in
 that is not Œ it™s 
not easily extinguishable. 
  

Q: Well, thank you so much. 

  

A: Thank you very much. It™s been
 very pleasant 
talking to you. 
  

Q: Oh, you, too. What we™re going to do is 
top the tape, and we™ll do the photographs. 
  

A: Okay, thank you.

sche, and the interes
ting thing about this 
picture, it™s taken in Zagre
b, that it™s picture is in bl

has seemed to taken it upon himself to hand co
lor the signs that they had to wear that  
said, ﬁJewﬂ, and this is what th

Q: [new photo shown] This? 

  

A: Both of those pictures Œ 
this picture was taken in 1943, I 
think, at the time when Stricek 
Ludva was in Jasenovac. This is Giza, his wi

erly Deutsche, and I 
and my brother, and the picture 
was taken at the photographers

 in Œ on the steps of his house, which was 
built by hi s parents, and this is more or less 
where I saw him when I saw him for the last 
time, and that™s how I think of 
him much of the time. It was 
taken probably in the 1970s.  
  

Q: [new photo shown] Oka y. 

  

A: This is in our house in Ludbreg, and Stri
cek and I often played the piano and violin 
together. There were people in the hous
e. I think you see from the left, some body™s 
elbow, and so we were entert
aining, playing some thing togeth
er, almost always classical 
music, and that™s the old pi
ano that belonged to his family on which I learned how to 
play.

Q: What kind of piano was it?  Do you reme mber? 
  

A: I don™t reme mber the brand. It was Austria
n, though, and Stricek had a violin which he 
thought was Galliano. He was very fond of it, but
 I do Œ I did have it looked at it, and it 
was a fake, but it was a reasonably good violi
n. He used to go and take lessons in 
Hungary and of course, in Varazdin, and I had my first lessons from one of our 

housekeepers who was actually a very well-versed
 lady but lost everything after the wa r, 
came to be our housekeeper, Marija Velovir,
 and she taught me  Ger man and piano, but 
later on I went to music school in Varazdin.
