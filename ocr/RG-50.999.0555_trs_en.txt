With that I would like you to join m e in welc om ing our Fir s t Per s on, Bob Behr .
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bob, thank  you s o muc h for joining us  today. I know c oming on the heels of a work ou
t 

at 8:00
 
in the m orning, you'r e raring to go.
 
 
Bob has  s o m uc h to s hare with us  in s uc h a s hort per iod of time that we will just jump right in. 
Does  that s ound good?
 
 
You s pent your c hildhood, Bob
, 
in Berlin befor e the war  began. Let's  start first with you telling 
us  about your  life in the year s  before Kr is tallnac ht, or Night of Br ok en Glass . Tell us about your early 
life.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, the ear ly life was  a mixture. I don't know how m uc h you know about history, 

European his tor y. We're not going to go into a long dis c us s ion aboutWor ld War I and that s or t of thing. 
But it does  play a part. You c an't get away fr om his tor y bec aus e if you do, you're m is s ing s omething 
els e.
 
 
Berlin was  a very ravis hing, m oder n city after the war. It 
had 
a lot of problems . The pr oblem s 
were often ec onom ic or politic al nature, which you're pr obably m or e interes ted instead of a les s on of 

his tory
. 
 
 
I'm going to tell you how I exper ienc ed the 1920s.
 
The 1920s was a tough
 
tim e for Germ any. 
They had lostWor ldWar I.
 
A little bit about m y own fam ily. My father was  a doc tor. My mother was  a 
hous ewife. And you know what?  I never  had any br others and s isters. I unders tand, s omebody told 
m e, that when I was  born m y m other  took
 
one look  at me and s aid, "Oh, boy. Enough is  enough."
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bob Behr:  So I r em ained an only c hild.
 
 
Did the Holoc aus t affect m e in thos e year s ?  The 1920s  were a very dynam ic  year s . One of 
the c ommunic ations , whic h many of you pr obably know in
 
a different way, was  the radio. The r adio was  
what TV is today. There were two mas s  c omm unic ations . One was  news paper s  and the other one was  
the r adio.
 
 
My father, a ver y dedicated s oc ial democ r at in thos e year s  who had volunteer ed for Wor ld 
War I
 
--
 
whi
c h I want you to r em em ber  bec aus e later on it s aved m y life. So he volunteer ed for the 
em peror . And other than that, life was  c ompletely norm al for a m iddle c las s fam ily. Nothing s pec ial 

about it, exc ept one thing whic h I want to s har e with you and that is
 
what I just m entioned, the radio.
 
 
Now, my father  was  a ver y politic ally minded per son. I want to injec t here, if I m ay, the fac t 
that being J ewis h
 
--
 b
eing J ewis h in my fam ily was  not the m os t impor tant thing in our life. It was  
s om ething we were born with. My fam ily was , firs t of all, German. And s econdly they were Ger m an. 
And thirdly, they wer e Ger m an. And only then did the J ewis h religion play a part. So I know I was  
J ewis h but it was  no big deal.
 
Pr etty s oon I c hanged my mind. Let me s hare with you ho
w my fir st 
greetings  with the Holocaus t, in the 1920s, when I was  7, 8 years old, c ame into being.
 

3 
 
 
My father, the dedic ated German, lis tened to the radio prac tic ally r ound
-
the
-
c lock. I was  muc h 
too young to unders tand what the mic r ophone s pouted out, exc ept one thing. There was a s peak er who 
kept s aying anti
-
J ewis h things
: t
he J ews  had lost WorldWar I, the J ews  had the black m arket, the 
J ews
; 
and he k ept going on. 90% of what c am e out of the louds peaker I didn't even understand. I heard 
the words . I know he was  talking about J ewis h people but the inner meaning didn't really s ink in. I was  
too young.
 
 
So what do you do when you're c urious , when you want to lear n s omething?  I went to my 
m other . I s ays : Mom  what is  this  bus
ines s I
 
heard on the radio about a c atas tr ophe, J ewis h people 
des tr oying Ger many, J ews  mus t be eradic ated? 
 
Of c ours e, I had no idea what eradic ated means. But 
s o I went to m y m other and s he, in her own kind way
 
tr ied to c alm me down and s aid
 d
on't you worr y 
about anything. And here, the next I'm s aying now is  a quote, "If your father  is  dumb enough and wants  

to lis ten to the politic ians , don't let it affect you." So what do you do when you hear that?  Exac tly that. It 
was  not s uppos ed to affec t. Exc ept the anti
-
J ewis h whic h c ame out of the louds peaker, the s peaker 
being in Munic h, and he kept at it.
 
 
Now, as  the politic al and ec onom ic  s ituation deteriorated in Germ any
 
--
 
and we don't have 
tim e to go into this
; j
us t trus t m e it's gotten bad
 
--
a
nd the anti
-
Jewis h pr opaganda increas ed
, t
he wor
s t 
Germ any was  affected in 1926,
 
'28, year s, the mor e anti
-
J ewis h they had bec ome. J ews  owned all the 
banks, owned all the m ovie hous es  a
nd
 
s o forth. But did it pers onally affec t me, deep down?  It 
annoyed m e. And as a kid I was  annoyed that my religion was  m aligned. But phys ic ally it didn't. I liv ed 

a norm al life as a kid. I went to s chool, played with my fr iends . We lived in the wes ter n part of Ber lin.
 
 
How many people have been to Berlin?  Not too many. But ther e was  a very dynam ic  c ity. 
And politic ally,
 
ec onomically, c ulturally and s o for th.
 
 
So I lived a norm al life as  a kid.We played.We went out. My m other  was  ver y c ultur ally 
interes ted. I s aw my first oper a when I was  about 9 year s  old and prom ptly fell as leep during the 

perfor manc e, but we don't want to hold that agains t her . But she thought culture m ust be ins tilled in 
you. So I was  c ultur ally educ ated.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If you don't mind m e mentioning this , Bob, your  par ents divor c ed and that would 

bec om e s ignific ant a little bit later.
 
> > Bob Behr
:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Hitler c am e to power, of c ours e, in 1933. In 1936, you went
 
--
 
you wer e s ent to s chool 
in Sweden. Tell us  why. Why was that s ignific ant? 
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, my mother
 
--
 
well, I'm going to jum p now from  the 1920s  to the 1936. In b
etween 
that tim e s pan, fr om  the 1920s  to 1933, a dynam ic  c hange oc c urr ed in Ger m any. The guy I'm talking 

about is  Adolph Hitler, bor n in Austria. He was n't even a Germ an. And he took over . Ther e was  no 
r evolution. I don't want you to think  there was  a big r evolution and Hitler c ame to power . Ther e was  one 
in Rus s ia. That was  the revolution. Ours was  a form ally appointed pr es ident
 
--
 
appointed Hitler 
J anuary
 
1933 and things im mediately began to c hange. They c hanged s o dr as tic ally, s o badly, that I 
would need
 
about four hours  to desc ribe. Now, you're not going to s it here for four hours and lis ten to 
m e, s o take my wor d for  it. It was bad. Suc h a r adic al c hange fr om a dem oc r atic s oc iety, whic h 
Germ any was  in the 1920s , to a dic tator s hip for a m an who had spoke
n on the r adio. The guy I 
m entioned in the beginning, who my father kept listening to and I hear d all of thes e anti
-
J ewis h s logans. 
That took over. That became the m ost impor tant things  for German life.
 
So life was  s o bad. If you guys  
would give m e two hours, I c ould tell you m ore about it. J us t right now, tr ust me, it was  bad. Anything 
that was  nic e, pleas ant and agr eeable was  forbidden for J ews .
 
 
My m other was  really worr ied, to have her c hild r ais ed in a c ountr y whic h hated you. Nothing 
you c ould do about it. It hated you. She was  looking ar ound and we were c om ing back  and ther e was  a 

gentleman in Sweden, whic h, of c ours e, is  a neutral c om pany, like Switzerland, and opened up a 
s c hool. And the s chool was  for  German Jewis h kids . And I was  fortunate enough 
to get enrolled ther e. I 
was  out of Germany. I was  out of anti
-
S em itism
; w
as  in a friendly, neutr al c ountr y. That's  what 
happened.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And tell us  why you c am e back .
 

4 
 
> > Bob Behr:  So I was out of Germ any. I was  free. I was  happy. And then all of a s udden about s ix 
m onths later we were c alled together in the
 
auditor ium  and the dir ector of the s c hool announc ed that 
the s c hool would c los e. Well, everybody had a long fac e. Nobody unders tood why it was  c los ed when 

ther e was  s uc h a wonder ful thing to
 
have, a free sc hool.
 
 
Well, when my m other went to the bank  in Germ any, in Berlin, to pick  up m oney to pay the 
tuition, the c lerk s aid, "Mrs .
 
Behr, we no longer c hange m oney into Swedish money.We need that 
m oney for differ ent things ." And what happened? 
 
No tuition. So the s c hool c los ed.
 
 
So s ix m onths after the happy freedom we wer e bac k  out on the s treet, s o to speak , literally. 
Some Swedis h families  wer e willing to tak e us in and keep us in Sweden but my mother
 
--
 
r em ember , 
we ar e Ger mans, Germ ans , Ger
m ans
 
--
 
s ays , "You c om e home." And I went back  home. After a 
s ix
-
m onth per iod I was  bac k  in Ber lin wher e things  had gotten fr om bad to wor s e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, Bob, becaus e our  tim e is s hort, we'r e going to m is s por tions . So I'm  going to now 
take you t
o November
 9 
--
 
9 and 10, 1938, Kris tallnac ht, Night of Brok en Glas s . Tell us  about that. You 
were 16 years  of age in Berlin. What do you r emember about Kris tallnac ht?  And what was  its  direc t 

impac t on you and your fam ily?
  
 
> > Bob Behr:  Fir st of all, I don't know how many of you know. Let me give it to you very quickly. 
Kr is tallnac ht, the Germ ans  went wild
 
--
 b
y Ger mans  I mean the Germ an population
 
--
 
went wild. It was  
a night when they burned s ynagogues, a night when they sm as hed the windows  of J ewis h
-
owned 
s tores. It was  a night where in addition to what I jus t s aid, arr ested 30,000 J ews , 
eeny, meeny, m iny
, 
mo
e,
 
and noe
 
was  my father. My biologic al father was  ar rested that night. I never s aw him again.
 
The 
J ews  who wer e arr ested were put into a c onc entration c am p, only bec aus e they wer e J ews
, o
ut of 
whic h was  only one way out, fr om the c oncentration c am p, on a s hip, and to another c ountry. My father 
was
 
--
 
m y biologic al father was  one of thos e.
 
 
So per s onally I did not suffer  on that evening. My  m other rec eived a phone c all fr om whom  I 
have no idea but that pers on told
 
her , d
on't let your  s on out of the hous e
; t
hey are arres ting people, 
they are beating them up and you don't want your s on to be moles ted. So I never  got out. I never got 
hur t.
 
 
But the atm
os pher e, I don't know
 
--
 
think about wher e you ar e from. When s uddenly all the 
c hur ches, all the r eligious  ins titutions  for wherever  you live get burned
, n
ot one c hurch
, n
ot one 
r eligious  ins titution
, a
ll of them . And why?  Bec aus e you wer e a J ew. No other
 
r eas on. And J ews  had to 
be elim inated fr om  Ger man life.
 
 
So I per s onally did not suffer  phys ic ally but s ur e did I s uffer m entally. All the J ews  wer e afr aid. 
I was  afraid. You c ould be arres ted at any tim e for no other r eas on bec ause Hitler didn't like you
r 
r eligion. That's  the beginning. So you have an idea it was  s om ething whic h a nation whic h c alls  its elf a 
very c ultured nation
 
--
 
thos e of you who know, that's pr obably ever ybody, Germ ans made beautiful 
m us ic , beautiful poetry, beautiful s c ienc e. Ever ything was  gr eat exc ept it was  all des tr oyed, m os t of it, 

at leas t, on that one night. 
 
 
You know where the wor d Kr is tallnac ht c om es  from ?  When they sm as hed the glas s  in the 
J ewis h s tores
, a
ll of that glas s fell on the floor and that's wher e the wor d Kris tall
nac ht c om es  from.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You c ontinued living with your  mother in Berlin until 1942, s o for another four years  
alm os t. Tell us a little bit about that time for you between Kr is tallnac ht and 1942 when you were 
ar r ested, inc luding I k now early you 
were for c ed into for ced labor in 1939, I believe. 
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, you alr eady get the idea that things had gotten wors e. Now let m e tell you how they 

got wors e.
 
Rem ember, I was in Sweden. I had to c ome hom e. And by that time the Nazis  ins tituted 
thing
s. They ins tituted for  J ews  s omething called forc ed labor.
 
 
Now, I don't want you to think  that for c ed labor is  the s am e as  labor, s lave labor . It's  not.With 
forc ed labor
 
--
 
s lave labor
, 
you wer e inc arc erated in a c onc entration c amp. Under  forc ed labor, y
ou had 
to go ever y mor ning to an offic e to get as s igned som e work whic h the gover nm ent believed is  

important, whether  you liked that work, whether you c ould phys ic ally do it, no. It was  only in the 
interes ts  of the gover nment that the J ews  do phys ic al labo
r. 
 

5 
 
 
And I'll give you s ome exam ples . I was  as s igned to c arry big bags  of c oal into buildings whic h 
had central heating and needed c oal to heat the fireplac es  and the centr al heating. I had to c arr y bric ks 
into c onstr uction s ites. Today you look around and
 
you s ee nothing but c ranes , ever ything automatic . 
Not 
in thos e days . Not in 1937, ' 38. They us ed Jews  to c arr y s upplies
 w
hic h c onstruction workers 
needed. You c arr ied it by hand
, c
limbed ladders  with bricks whic h Mas ons  needed. So that's one 
indic ation.
 
 
In addition, the s oc ial life, the little bit of s oc ial life which J ews  had, was  c urtailed. Let m e give 
you a c ouple of examples . Have you been upstairs  yet?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Probably not.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Ok. When you go upstairs  to the fourth floor to s ee the exhibit about the Holoc aus t, when 

you get off the elevator
 
--
 
that's m y c ommerc ial
 
--
 
ther e is  a sm all s c r een on the r ight
-
hand s ide agains t 
the wall. That is, in my opinion, one of the m os t devas tating exhibits  in that whole mus eum . It's not very 
dr ama
tic . It's a little televis ion s c reen and it was  a r olling band of information.
 
Do me a favor . Spend 
thr ee, four minutes  in front of that exhibit bec aus e what it will s how you ar e all the m eas ur es  that the 

Nazis  ins tituted agains t the J ews .
 
 
I c an give you a c ouple of exam ples  bec aus e he won't let m e talk muc h longer . For example, 
J ews  wer e not allowed to have a c ar. J ews  wer e not allowed to have a telephone. Jews  wer e not 
allowed 
entertainm ent. I c ouldn't go to the m ovies . The things you enjoy, spor ts. I do
n't have the 
opportunity to be c los er to you other wis e s ome audienc e ask what's your favorite s port. Let m e c ut 
ac r oss and tell you what m ine was . I loved to swim . So with a shortage of water ?  No. Plenty of water . 
But the water had to be someplac e. It had
 
to be in a pool, whether pr ivately  owned or c ity owned or  
s tate owned, you needed a pool with water to s wim . And that goddamn pool
 
--
 
exc us e my language.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Bob Behr:  It a
 
big s ign, J ews  not allowed to swim in this pool.
 
So, bingo, that was  gone.
 
We wer e 
not allowed to have animals , hous e pets. I had to get rid of my little dog.
 
 
And what is  most im portant
 
--
 
let me take you bac k  to 1934. In 1934
 
--
 
it's a long story. You 
don't have tim e. In 1934 the Nazis
 
--
 
ever y year  from  1934
 
--
 
actuall
y 1933, in the m onth of September, 
until the end of the war in 1944 the Nazis  had a big r ally. 100,000 Germ ans  together in uniform, without 

unifor m, s inging, m ar c hing, having a great big tim e. Hitler c am e to s peak  ever y year .
 
Now, why I do 
m ention that in 
1934?  I think in the beginning I mentioned that m y father volunteered for the Arm y and 
fought in World War I. So in 1934 the Nazis  it dec r eed in that s am e rally in that s am e as s embly, that the 
J ews , effective imm ediately, are no longer Germ an c itizens .
 
 
Now, jus t think back from  where you ar e fr om and s om ebody c omes
 
to
 
you and s aying you 
were born in Americ a, you had an Americ an pas sport if you needed one, and it's no longer  valid
; y
ou 
ar e no longer a c itizen. You ar e s imply a r es ident whom we allow to s tay in the c ountr y but your c ivil 
r ights  like voting, like ever ything, was  gone from  Jews . J ews  were depr ived of this . Ok? So it was  
getting s lowly but s ur ely wor s e and wor s e and wors e. And there was  no way out.Why was  ther e no 
way out?  Let me just m entio
n it br iefly.
 
 
You c ould think
:  
I'm J ewis h. I'll c hange m y r eligion. Can I do this ?  Sure you c an. You c an go 
to a pries t and s ay father, I want to bec ome a Catholic . And after c ertain rituals , the pr iest perfor ms  the 

r ights  and yo
u are now a Catholic . But
 
why 
do 
I 
mention this ?  Bec aus e the Nazis  had a different 
philos ophy. Sur e you c an c hange your r eligion. You c an c hange it three times  if you want to and if you 

c an but the Nazi hatr ed of the J ews
 
--
 
and that you've got to get into your head, the Nazi hatr ed of the 
J ews  was  about the blood. J ews  had bad blood, were born with bad blood. J ews  had blood 
--

undes er ving to be a Germ an.
 
Now, c hange your  r eligion?  Sure. Can you c hange your  blood?  No. 
You're s tuck  with it. 
 
 
When I talk  to 8th gr aders , I us ually do a little tes t. I s aid I want all the people in the audienc e 
who have br own eyes  to s tand up. They look at me. They don't s ay anything. 
 
 
No, you don't have to do that.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

6 
 
> > Bob Behr:  If you want to, go
 
ahead. Stand up and I will give you the example. If you have br own 
eyes , s tand up. Don't s it down.
 
And now I'm c oming and telling you that all people with brown eyes  ar e 
bad people. So you look  at eac h other and s ay
: W
hat in the wor ld is  he talk ing about?
  
I was  bor n with 
br own eyes . Sure you wer e. I was  born J ewis h. Sam e thing. Som ebody c om es to J ews  ar e bad
 
--
 
thank 
you ver y m uc h. J ews  are bad. You're stuck  with it bec aus e you have bad blood.
 
 
So I'm tr ying to give you an idea what life was  like after Kr
is tallnac ht. It 
had 
gotten s o bad. The 
one ques tion in your mind: If it was  s o bad, why in the world didn't you leave?  My God, there was  no 
war yet, there was  nothing, why c ouldn't you?  Did the Ger mans  stop you from leaving?  Heck no. You 
want to go, go.
 
It's  getting into a c ountr y whic h was  the diffic ulty. It was  ver y diffic ult. 
 
 
Am eric a did not play a ver y good r ole in this . Amer ic a ins tituted meas ur em ents whic h 
pr evented me and other German J ews  to c ome to Am eric a. And the key wor d I would love for you to 

r em em ber is the word affidav it. Now
,  
what in the wor ld is  an affidavit?  An affidavit is  nothing but a 
s pons or. Subs titute the word affidavit for the wor d s pons or and you got the Am eric an law whic h 

P
r es ident Roos evelt ins tituted in s aying you m us t have an Amer ic an fam ily  to s pons or you to c om e to 
Am er ic a.
 
 
You know, I went down to the Am eric an Embas s y, the old one whic h was  des troyed during 
the war. I s aid, we got to get out of here. Ther e is  no living her e anymor e. There is  no exis tenc e 

anym or e. I wen
t to the em bas s y. I stood ar ound. Finally got in
. 
I was  m et by a young lady who s poke 
fluent Germ an
 
--
 
bec ause I c ertainly didn't s peak  any Englis h. Can we help you?  I told her my mother  
and I would love t
o 
go to Americ a
; 
we want to get out of this  c ountry. And prom ptly she s ays
, "Do you 
have an affidavit?ﬂ Do you have a s pons or ?  The ans wer was  no. We didn't get out. It was  that s im ple.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bob, bec aus e there's  s o muc h more you c ould tell us , at this  point I'm  going to m ove 

us  for ward.
 
>> Bob
 
Behr:  Sure.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to move us for ward to J uly
 
1942. I will, if you don't m ind
 
--
 
your  m other  got 
m arried. She r em arr ied dur ing that tim e. So in J uly
 
1942, you and your mother and your stepfather 
were all arr es ted. Tell us about thos e 
events .
 
> > Bob Behr:  Do we have another  two hour s ? 
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Bob Behr:  We wer e not arr ested bec aus e we were J ews . By 1942, the Germ ans  began to over
-
oper ate the gas  c hambers
;  
Aus c hwitz, gas  c ham ber  was  going full blas t. You know that s ix m illion
 
people were killed.
 
So we wer e ver y worr ied. And to m ake it wors e, m y m other
 
--
 
I'm still upset when I 
think  about it. The s tory of our ar rest had nothing to do with J ewis h or anything els e. Plain s tupidity. Let 
m e tell you very br iefly. 
 
 
My m other had a
 
lady fr iend. I don't know whether they m et in s c hool or they me
t 
in boar ding 
s c hool. I don't r eally r emember that. But that lady c am e to m y mother in 1942 and s aid
:  
Lilly
 
--
 
m y 
m other 's fir st nam e, 
Lilly, I need to get out of Germ any. I don't have no fami
ly
. 
I'm all alone in this  world. 
Can you think  of any way that we c an get out of this  mes s whic h is  now k nown as  Germany?  And my 

m other , by c hance, knew a pries t, a very wonderful man who taught in
 
Kons tanz
. 
 
 
Now that does n't mean anything. You go back hom e and you have 
nothing
 
better to do, tak e a 
Germ an m ap and look  wher e 
Konstanz
 
is . I'll give it to you. 
Kons tanz is  s o c los e to Switzer land that you 
take a rock  and throw it, that r ock  will land in Switzerland whic h, of c our s e, you know, was  a neutr al, 

f
r iendly c ountr y.
 
 
To m ake a long s tor y s hor t, everything happened like c lockwor k . She gave the wom an the 
addr es s  of the pries t. She went, m et the pr iest, som ehow per s uaded him to take her by night ac r os s  the 

bor der into Switzerland. And that's what happene
d.
 
 
So my mother was  free. We didn't know anything about this . It's c oming bac k  later. So the 
woman was  fr ee. And now what did s he do?  She wr ites  a postc ard in Switzerland thanking my m other  
for the help s he has  pr ovided to get her  out into Switzerland. So obvious ly s he per s uaded the pries t to 
help her  and he did and she was  fr ee. 
 

7 
 
 
And now here com es  the c lue. She wants  to s how her appr ec iation for the help that my 
m other  was  g
iving
 
her by pr oviding the pries t's  addres s . And s he wr ites  the pos tc ard, whic h
 
is the first 
m is take. You don't wr ite pos tc ar ds  to c ountries lik e Ger many. So s he writes  a postc ar d with a picture of 
the c apital and wr ites  down that s he arr ived and that s he is  happy. And then s he writes  a P.S., "If it 
hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be
 
her e." 
 
So if you ar e a Nazi c ens or, you read this , you look at the 
s tamp, it's a Swis s  s tamp. You k now that wom an was  out. She got out
 a
nd that m y mother was  the one 
to help her . And the Gestapo c am e and arr es ted all of us bec aus e helping s om ebody es c ape
 
from 
Germ any was  punis hable by very s evere things.
 
 
Nor mally I wouldn't be s itting her e. After  this  postcard deal I would have been s ent
 
--
 
m y 
family would have been s ent to Ausc hwitz, any one of thos e killing c am ps, and killed.
 
So why didn't 
we?  Why were we s aved? We were s aved bec aus e m y father  was  a veteran ofWor ldWar I. I c an 
give you a long explanation. That is a televis ion pr ogram you s hould look at. Very good. If you later  on 
want to know about it I'll be m ore than happy to tell you.
 
We wer e ar
r ested but not killed bec aus e in the 
c onfer enc e they dec ided what to do with the J ews . Num ber one, kill them. And they did. Number two, 

r em ove them fr om s oc iety, ar r est them , is olate them. So we fell under the s ec ond c ategor y bec ause the 
Nazis  decided that
 
veterans  of Wor ld War I would not be dead. They would be arr es ted, restr ic ted, 
r em oved from  s oc iety but they would not be killed. That is  wher e we c ame in. That's  how we wound up 

in the c onc entr ation c amp.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther es iens tadt.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Th
er es ienstadt.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about going to Ther es ienstadt and what that was  like for you.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, first of all, you got to know what is  Ther es iens tadt. Theres iens tadt had two names . 

It had a Germ an nam e while it was  oc c upied by the Germ ans . I know, in Mar c h 1939, the Nazis  

oc c upied Czec hos lovakia and the c ountry ceas ed to exis t. It bec ame a Germ an c olony. And among the 
facilities  they inher ited the gold Garr is on town whic h the Aus trians  had built and us ed whic h was  c alled 
under the Ge
rm ans Theres iens tadt and under  the Czec h whic h owned the land, owned the c ountr y, it 
was  c alled Ter ezin. Same differ enc e.
 
 
So we wer e s ent up there. And that was  a little town whic h had appr oximately [Indis c ernible], 
s oldier s . Ther e was  no m or e Czec hos lovakia s o ther e was  no m or e soldiers . But the fam ilies  wer e s till 

ther e. There wer e 4,000 c ivilian fam ilies  of the s oldier s , r elatives , s om ehow related to the s oldier who 
lived there. They had little hous es  and s o forth.
 
 
The Germ ans  s aid, boy, this  is  exac tly what we need to put s om e of the Jews we ar e not 
going to kill.We'r e going to put them in Theres iens tadt. And a big im migration into this. They built a wall 

ar ound it. You were a prisoner , a pr is oner who would never  get out. That was  the rest of your lif
e.
 
Now, 
it was  not a pr is on. I want to be s ur e you understand that. It was  a little town with a wall ar ound it. And 

the only thing whic h was  pretty was  the sky above. Ever ything els e was  c ut off.
 
 
When we ar rived, we wer e in a building whic h had abs olutely
 
nothing in it. You've never s een 
s uc h an empty building in your life. Ther e wer e four walls  outs ide, divide us  ins ide. Not a s titc h of 

furnitur e, nothing. No s traw on the floor , nothing. You had to s leep on the floor. Ther e was  no s anitar y 
facility, no to
ilet.We had no water . You had to go outs ide and ac tually pump the water.
 
 
The wors t par t about all of this , bes ides  the hunger and the illnes s es  and the des pair
 
--
 
people 
ar e despair ed when you take s omebody out of his norm al envir onment and s hove them into a thing like 
Theres iens tadt. It is a major differenc e, a major differ enc e.
 
So we went there. Now, life in the c amp was  
terr ible. First of all, you were c onstantly hungr y. You were constantly s ad bec aus e ther e was  no
 
--
 
the 
one thing you need to under s tand is  this . When people live under  thos e conditions , they ar e not very 

nic e. Thos e people who were for c ed into this  m ess , ar e not pleas ant. It's  not that the beatin
gs
 
--
no. But 
they wer e unfr iendly, a chip on their s houlders.
 

 
You ever been to New York?  Mos t New Yor ker s  have a c hip on their  s houlders . Yeah, yeah. 
They ar e really nic e people but under  the c onditions  they live in, the c onstant pr es s ur e, makes them  not
 
very likeable.
 
I'm jus t kidding
, t
o any New Yorker who may be in the audienc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How many people were c rowded into the room ? 
 

8 
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, if you take where we ar e s itting and m ake one room out of this
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where we ar
e s itting.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Yeah. Where we are s itting. How m any people would you norm ally
 
--
 
remember, there 
were no beds . Ther e wer e no c ots. There was  no s tr aw. There was  nothing. They would have put about 
35, 38 people in her e. J us t picture that. No toilet fac ility, no water . It was  July. It was  ver y hot. You were 
als o c ons tantly hungr y.
 
 
But the thing you los t, at leas t I los t, the thing whic h is  s o diffic ult to describe and what kept us 
going all of thes e years
 
--
 
r em ember, I had the pleas ure in 1933, talking about 12 years  ago now
 
--
 
the 
thing that k ept us  going. I'll give you one word. Can anybody think about it?  
 
 
Hope. H
- o- p-
e. Hope kept us going. If it hadn't been for hope m ore people would have 
c om m itted s uic ide. Hope kept us  going. And the longer we lived in this  c amp, under the c ir c umstanc es  

that I just desc r ibed, the further away went the wor d hope. Ever ything was  in favor  of the Germans. 
Nothing was left for us to enjoy. Love is n't what kept us going. Hope is  the one that kept us  going. Hope 
c on
nec ted with the knowledge that this c annot last forever. Something has got to c hange.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bob, ther e ar e s o m any things you c ould tell us more about Theres iens tadt but tell us  

about the work that you wer e for c ed to do, the job that you were gi
ven.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Well, the fir s t job
 
--
 
I had a whole bunc h of jobs . The fir st one was  to build a r ailr oad. The 
r ailroad tr acks wer e not c onnec ted to Theres ienstadt s o the people had to walk s ix kilometers fr om the 

near es t railroad s tation to the c amp, whic h was  hot, mis er able. People died on thos e s ix kil
om eter s. 
That was  first job.
 
 
The next job I was  ac tually very luc ky. I got to wor k  in a kitc hen. Now, when I s ay this  and you 
think  about kitchen and cleaning, kitc hen work was  a bles s ing. Why?  Becaus e
 
you had s om ething to 
eat. Ther e was  always  s omething left over.
 
 
And then, of c our s e, that didn't las t ver y long. Now I'm going to tak e you bac k  for  a little bit of 
his tory. In the m eantime, we'r e talking 1942, 
‚
43, the Allies , partic ularly the Am eric ans  
and the Br itis h, 
began to bom b Germ any.
 
 
If you ever  see old news reels  of videos  of Berlin right after the war, you will s ee the c ity was  
c om pletely destroyed. Why I'm mentioning this  is  one of the buildings  they des tr oyed was  the 

headquar ters  of the SS headed by Heinric h H
i
m m ler, a four
-
star building, whos e building, number  8 in 
Berlin, was destr oyed. So he los t his  headquar ters . He went to the Germ an author ities  and s aid
: 
 
I got 
to have a new headquarters
. 
I am in c harge of all of the SS of all the c onc entration c am ps , got to have 
an office. And the Germ ans  ac c om modated him, gave him a piec e of land and s aid, ok , here is  your  

land; you c an build your self a new headquarters.
 
 
"Build your s elf," he c ouldn't. Didn't. They went to Ther es iens tadt wher e we were pr is oner s and 
s aid we need people to go to the fields  to build that guy a new headquarters . And then they added a 

s entenc e. And that's the s entenc e whic h is  in m y life mos t im portant. They s aid, "If you volunteer  to go 
ther e, we will not evac uate your folks ," meaning my mother and my s tepfather. "We will not evac uate."
 
 
Now, everybody in that cam p knew that ther e were two wor ds  whic h you never want to hear 
again. One is  evac uate and the other  one is  res ettle. What the Nazis  did with everybody in the 

c am p
 
--
 
and this  is a long s tory and I don't have time. But everybody in the c am p knew when a Nazi 
s ays  we'r e going to res ettle or evac uate your folks, that m eans  we want to kill them . That was  a c ode 

for killing. Everybody knew. How we knew is  another  long stor y
 b
ut we knew.
 
 
And when they promis ed that they would not evac uate or res ettle our  folk s , my mother and my 
s tepfather, I volunteer ed to go. Now, this m ay have been a m istake but it saved the life of m y m other 
and him bec aus e for once the Nazis  kept their wor d. When we retur ned in J anuar y of 
`
45
 
--
 
and I'll tell 
you 
about it in a m inute
 
--
 
m y folks  wer e still alive. They wer e ac tually, thanks to my volunteer ing, still 
alive.
 
 
So I volunteered to go ther e. It was a piec e of land with nothing on it. If you ha
d to go and 
m ake pee
-
pee, you had to go against the tree. If you wer e luc ky to find one.
 
To give you a tas te of the 
plac e where we worked
 
--
 
ladies  and gentlemen, what I'm  s aying now I'm not very proud of. But it was  
the fir s t time s inc e 1933 that I wanted
 
to die. I had always  told m ys elf I will not give the Ger mans  the 

9 
 
s atisfaction to die, s uic ide or otherwis e, r unning agains t an electr ic fenc e and getting elec tr oc uted, I will 
not do this; I will s ur vive this  mes s s o that I c an talk  to people like you and tell them how it was . But 
now, for the fir st tim e, I had enough. 
 
 
There's a long s tory, again, which I won't bor e you with, just to s ay that I got very s ick. I had a 
vitamin defic ienc y, whic h is  ver y ugly. You get big blotc hes all over your body. You get a ver y high 

temper atur e. And you feel just lous y. And I had enough. I said I don't want it anym ore, I don't want to 

live anymore. I was  m illing ar ound, whic h is  the bes t way to do away with mys elf.
 
And on November  or 
ear ly Dec ember
 
1944
 
--
 
forgive m e, I don't know exac tly. I was  s tanding at the fenc e, at the barbed wire 
fenc e of the c onc entr ation c am p, on the ins ide. There was  another  guy with m e. It was  a Sunday. 
Bec aus e on Sunday we didn't have to work . So he and I were looking out. It was  Novem ber, c old,
 
m is erable, not ver y pleas ant. I was  feeling ac c ordingly. We looked out. And what we s aw was  amazing. 
We s aw on the highway jus t outs ide the bar bed wir e a truck of people walking with all kinds  of 
m oveable objec ts, c ar, baby c arr iage, anything you c ould, bic yc le. Ther e was  a c ons tant stream  of 
people m oving. 
 
 
Now, the important thing is : Wher e wer e they moving?  This  is  s omething I need to explain to 
you. Thes e Germ ans out ther e were m oving fr om eas t to wes t. Now, give m e two minutes and I will 
explain.
 
In
 
1941, the Germ ans  attacked the Soviet Union. And from  then on until 1943 all the movem ent 
by the Germ ans  were fr om  wes t to east, towar ds  Mos c ow, to oc c upy Mos c ow and win the war, all the 
tim e. The Ger m ans kept winning.
 
If you look  at a m ap of 1939, 1940, of Eur ope, you will s ee that 90% 
of Eur ope was  Ger man. The Germ ans  oc c upied it.
 
 
So now for the first tim e we s aw s om ething which I didn't even under stand
. I
t was the guy wh
o 
was  with m e. I s aid, "Who are thes e people?"  He s aid, "They ar e Germ an." I s aid,
 
"Well, wher e ar e 
they going?"  He s aid, "Well, don't you s ee?  They ar e going fr om east to wes t. They ar e fleeing from  

the Rus s ians." So the Rus s ians  had tur ned the war  around. After the Battle of Stalingr ad, the Rus s ians  
kept winning and winning and pus hing the Ger mans  back . And what we s aw ther e was  the Rus s ians  
had c ome s o c los e that the m ost eas tern Pr ovinc e of Ger many, Eas t Pruss ia, was  now threatened by 
the Rus s ian Ar my who had ever y r eas on to be bitter about the Germ ans .
 
 
So he explained to me that Germ ans were fleeing fr om the Rus s ians . And I thought by mys elf, 
you know, if the Rus s ians  ar e that c los e that they ar e almost in fr ont of our c onc entr ation c amp, whic h 

they m ay liber ate
, m
aybe I s houldn't die
; m
aybe I s hould try to live.
 
 
And t
o m ake a lo
ng s tor y s hort, with the help of my higher  power
, 
I was  able to s urvive this . 
Returned to the m ain c onc entr ation c am p in J anuar y of 1945. I found m y m other and s tepfather weak , 
unhappy, but alive. I was back with them. I was  bac k  in the main c onc entration c am p. And on the 5th of 

May, 1944, or 
`
45, exc us e m e, we wer e liber ated by the Rus s ians . The war  was  over.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bob, as you s aid, the war  was  ov er  for you. I know we don't have tim e to talk  about all 

of the events that occ urred then but if you wouldn't mind, you told us earlier that your  biologic al father, 
after  he was  ar r ested at Kr is tallnac ht, had left Ger many.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You s et out to s ee if you c ould c onnec t with him. Tell us what happened.
 

> > Bob Behr:  Well, I had
 
no idea what happened to m y biologic al father  but I was  able
 
--
 
the Amer ic an 
gover nm ent had opened the c ons ulate in Pr ague, in Czechos lovakia, and with the help of the Red 

Cros s  I found out that my father was able to get out of the c onc entr ation c am p in 
`
38 and into Cuba fir st 
and then from Cuba to the United States. So he was  ther e. He was  alive.
 
 
When I finally m anaged to get out of Germ any, c las s ifies  in 1947, I expec ted m y father to 
s tand at the pier  and s ay hello to his son.Well, ins tead was  a lady who s aid, "You don't know m e. I am  
a friend of your  father's. Your father died two day s  ago." So I never s een him again s inc e befor e he was  
ar r ested. I was  without anybody. I was  all alone in Am eric a, whic h c an be pr etty tough.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e going to c los e our pr ogr am s oon in jus t a few m inutes. It's  our tr adition at
 
Fir s t 
Person
 
that our Fir st Pers on gets the las t word s o I'm going to tur n back to Bob for his  las t word.
 
When he finis hes , he's  going to remain on the stage bec aus e we didn't have tim e for ques tions and 
ans wers . So if you have a question or  just want to s ay hi to Bob, s hake his  hand, abs olutely, please feel 

10
 
 
fr ee to c om e up on the stage and do that. And obvious ly there's s o m uc h that we did not c over, 
inc luding the fact that Bob retur ned ver y quickly to Germ any as an intelligenc e offic er, was  able to 
s pend s ome m or e time with his  mother  before she pas s ed away. So I hope that you c an do that.
 
 
I'm just

we'r e all s o grateful for Bob. Anytim e you talk about what you went through but 
par tic ular ly r ight now. This  is  the Days  of Remembr anc e of the Holoc aust, s o very s ignific ant. 71 years  
s inc e your  liberation on this  date in 1945.
 

 
On that note, I will tur n bac k  to Bob for his  last wor ds  to c los e our program.
 
> > Bob Behr:  Thank  you.
 
 
Well, you alr eady know my age. I am 94 years old. Why in the world am  I s itting her e talking to 
people I have never met? What's  the big deal?  Do I get paid?  No. Did I get s ome s pec ial privileges ?  

No. I'm s itting here for only one reas on and that r eas on is  very dear  to my hear t. It's  to give you, my 

audienc e, the oppor tunity to under stand what c an happen if you don't watc h out. I mean, the ability to 
c om m unic ate s uffer ing, undeserved s uffer ing, is  the motivation for  m e to pr event you from falling into 
the s ame tr ap as the Germ an people did, believing Hitler . I am m otivated to be here hoping that when 
you leave here, this museum , m y s peec h, that you take s om ething with you whic h
 
in es s enc e is : I shall 
not stand by and see what is  wrong. If you s ee s omething wrong, whatever  it m ay be, whether it's a 

little thing or it's a big thing, and you feel str ong enough, do s omething.
 
 
That's what happened to the Ger mans. They took  this  lying down in 
`
33 and never, ever 
thought about doing s omething. Bec aus e they didn't
 t
her e was  no r evolution. There was  no 
Hitler
 
--
 
Hitler was n't killed. He killed him self finally in 1945.
 
 
Your  m is s ion in life
 
--
 
now I'm talking like a televis ion progr am. Your m is s ion in life is  to be 
alert, to watc h out. And if you c an, help people prevent things  from  happening and do s omething where 
you go hom e, look in the mirr or and say I've done a good deal; I have helped s om ebody
; 
I have 
advis ed s omebody
;  
I have done s om ething whic h is  important. 
 
 
Bec aus e, ladies  and gentlem en, I won't be s itting her e muc h longer . Life has  granted m e the 
pr ivilege to live 94 year s . I am not going to be here muc h longer. And the burden of helping, the burden 
of pr oof, will r es t on you. You have to c ar ry the wor d. We won't be here. Survivor s  will die out. That's 
jus t the way things  are organized. There won't be any s ur vivor  to tell you life s tories . But you c an say I 

hear d one. I learned a les s on. I c an't just stand by ther e and s ee s omething which I know is  wr ong. 
Whatever is in m y power , m aybe s om ething big, m aybe s om ething little, maybe just an enc our aging 
word, you c an do s omething.
 
And if you c an, if in your  heart you feel you s hould, then do it. 
 
 
That's m y par ting
. T
h
ank  you for c oming here tonight and lis tening to m e.
