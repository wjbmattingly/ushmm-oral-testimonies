Q: Œ you know, just Œ yeah, just st ick it out, wait and see. 
A: And I remember many, many argument s. And then, in 1937, Jewish children

And he smoked his pipe. And he was just 16, you know, so he was reall y Œ  

Q: Yeah.  

A: Yeah.  

Q: So it was Œ it was surprising to see hi m like that?  

A: Yeah, well, it was embarrassing, because, you know, he was my brother and I di-

didn™t want  the other kids to know that he was my brother. 
Q: And I don™t Œ I don™t remember if I asked you this, but your younger brother is in 
Belgium

A: You know. 

Q: Yeah. Were you ever, you know, as the war starts getti ng closer, were you ever

say? I was Œ you know, I went to school with t he children in 
London
, and then the 
only difference was when we were evacuated, I was evacuated with a girl who lat er 

went to

them, and when they found out that they were Jews who were only there to Œ for a 

certain period of time, they were very, very upset, the people that they worked for.

And m yhusband said, wewent 
Œ we Œ we Œ t he street wasn™t there, and the house 
wasn™t there, when we went to look for it. And he sort of rubbed his hands and said, 

this is what the English did to us by night, and the Americans by da y. And it was 
Cologne
 
flattened, and 
Œ and I remember m y husband handing back t he photograph 
and sa ying, fantastic, precision bombing. And we left, right after that. So, that was 

our experience in 
Germany
.

A: Was standing. No bombs had hit it. That was really fantastic, precision bombing.

A: Oh well , yeah. Not really, 
Lisa
.  
A2: But you listen to the radio. 

A: Yeah, I do. I mean, I™m interested in politics, so that™s Œ I think what part of it is,

politics. So I still am. And get mad.

A: Yeah, but that™s it. I mean, that™s Œ no. I don™t even remember, I don™t have 
friends who Œ you™re the only one who pursued it a little bit. You know, I just Œ I 

think part of it is because I was an adolescent, and I Œ 
itwas more i mportant for me 

to, you know, disappear into the community. So Œ  

Q: To integrate, and Œ 
A: Right, exactly. 
Q: Yeah. Is there anything you wish people knew, about living in 
Germany
, or in 
England
, during the ti mes that you did? 
A: Yeah. It™s very forei gn to most people. The
y don™t 
Œ you know, my age, do not 
remember any of that. So it™s like, you know, that new experience, to tell them about 

it, but I da Œ hardly ever do, you know, tal k about it. 
Q: And why is that? 
A: I don™t know. Because it is Œ it ™s not somet hing people have experienced, and it™s 
hard to, you know, tell them about  that ti me. 

Q: Yeah. Is there anything we haven™t talked about, that you would li ke to add? Any 

Œ anything we didn™t cover, in the rest of the i nterview?  

A: No, I don™t think so. I™m sure I will remember the minute you wal k out, but no, 

not really. Not really.

we™re done with the interview, and you know, you can tell us what™s going on i n 

each one. But if Œ if there™s nothing you want t o add, we can Œ 

A: Yeah, I Œ yeah, I™m interested in what you are interviewing for. What Œ 
what you 
Œ are you interviewi ng a lot of people who Œ I don™t know what Œ  
Q: Me specificall y, or t he Œ 
the museum?

possible, so that we can learn more about Œ

A: I™m tryi ng to think of what I could – no, I think Œ 
Ithi nk my experiencesare m y 
age, if there are people that you interview, will  have had the same experiences. It 

was very important  for me as an adolescent, to be integrated into t he Œ and not t o 

feel like a refugee, wit h that Œ 
you k
now, I™m quoting that. It™s a special kind of 
feeling. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: And I haven™t had that for a long ti me. So Œ anything you can add, I would 

answer.  

Q: I think we Œ 
we got m y questions.
 
A: Oka y. 

Q: So, yeah. 

A: I™m not a font of experiences. I got married very young, and Œ trying to think 
what I can add. I really can™t.  
Q: And if you thi nk of other things, we can al ways record over the phone, in 

addition to the interview. 

A: Oh yeah, it Œ I probably Œ as I said, as soon as you walk out, I™ll remember a l ot 

more.
 
Q: Yeah. So we can Œ we can alwa ys do that. 

A: Yeah, we can.
