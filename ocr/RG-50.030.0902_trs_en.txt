A: So it was a very fraught time, and a Œ actually living through a remarkable 
period in world history.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Not one  I woul d want to repeat, but Œ  

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ it™s there. 
Q: So, tell me, do you have any earl iest mem ories that are Œ even if they™re 

episodic, or, you know, a little vague. But do you have some about your first years? 

A: Well, I Œ I have Œ yes, I do have some memories. The y™re very Œ 
because I was 

so young during t he war years, some of them are vague, some of them ma y be 

mixed in with things that I was tol d later, or once I came here, things that I had read 

Œ read about , or heard about. But some of m y earliest memories are sl eeping in a Œ 
in a Œ in a crib, and seeing a picture over m y bed. Sleeping on a diagonal wall, and 
there was eit her a picture, or a cross hanging over m y bed. And wondering, why 

would that image be there? Now Œ 

Q: And would the picture have been of anybody you knew? 

A: It Œ it ma y have been of my parents. I don™t really know. 

Q: Oka y.

Q: Oka
y.
 
A: Œ over t he crib. Now what I learned was t hat I was in the bedroom where m y Œ 
where m y parents sl ept, becau Œ and m y si sters and brother Œ I had five sisters and 

one brother Œ were in t he other room, but I was so small that I was in a crib in their 

bedroom. 
Q: Were you the youngest of the family? 
A: Yes. I™m the youngest of seven. 

Q: So, I™d like now to talk a little bit about your family. Tell me, who were your 

brothers and sisters, and could you name t hem for me? 

A: Sure. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Well, starting from t he eldest, m y brother 
Alpho nse
(ph) is 12 years older than I. 
Q: And he™s the only boy? 

A: He™s the only boy in Œ in the family, yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Actually, I think Œ I think I was supposed to be a boy, beca Œ wel l, because the 

n ame 
Bela 
isreally a man
™s name. But I guess, you know, the y got what the y got. 
Then my sister, 
Zenta
(ph). 
Q: Oka y.

Germany

Alphonse

Zenta

A: Her name was a Œ 
Ba nda
(ph). So le Œ len Œ  on Œ 
ontheir marri age certifica
te, I 
think it sa ys, 
Lena
(ph) 
Ba nda
(ph). 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And she was from 
Hungary
. 
Q: Do you know what part? 
A: 
Rokopolishta
(ph). I don™t know wh Œ I think it™s probably the west ern side of 
Hungary
. My father, who was born in Œ came from 
Po wderbo urne
 in
 Westphalia
, 
had gone Œ his family, I think, were umbrella makers, and he had traveled to Œ t o 

Hungary
 to sell umbrellas, and he met Œ was a little bit l ike meet ing 
Rachel
 at t he 
well. I think he si mply saw her, and struck up a friendship, and Œ and the y got Œ he 

then Œ he was born a C atholic, converted to Judaism, because my mot her was the 

daughter of a r Œ of a cantor. 
Q: Wow.
 
A: So the y were Orthodox Jews. He converted to Judaism in order to be able to 

marry her. 

Q: And do you know anyt hing about her side of th
e family?
 
A: Her side of the famil y? 

Q: Mm-
hm, yeah.
 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

A: Other than the fact that she was the daught er of a ra Œ of a cantor, I don™t think I 
do. 

Q: Do you know if she had brothers and si sters? 

A: I Œ I don™t recall. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: There ma y Œ 
there ma y haveb
een. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But I certainly never met them. 

Q: And do your Œ on your father™s side of the family, do you know if he had 

brothers and sisters? 

A: Yes. I Œ  I Œ I don™t recall now how many, but I know t hat he was t he oldest Œ the 
eldest of at least one, maybe two or three brothers and sist ers. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And when he and my mother traveled back to 
Germany
, they went to his 
family, and at which point the family sort  of disowned hi m, because he had married 

outside of Catholicism. And so there was a total break in t he family. 

Q: Was the same true on your mot her™s side? 

A: I™m sorry? 

Q: Wasthe samething truefor your mother™s side?
 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016

A: I don™t believe so. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Because he had converted to Judaism. 

Q: I see. I see. 

A: And s Œ and Œ 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ and h- he practiced Judaism up un Œ really up until t he time t hat we left 

Germany
, after the war. 
Q: In those Œ 

A: Ev Œ 
excuse me.
 
Q: Yeah, sure. 

A: Even though Œ even though in 1940, he was sort of forced to renounce his 
conversion, and once again become Catholic. But I don™t think Œ from things t hat 
I™ve read, that my brot her has written Œ because I would have no personal 

knowledge Œ I Œ I t hink he continued to, if not outwardly practice Judaism, still 

believe in t he Jewish faith. 

Q:Oka y. Do you have memoriesof 
your mother and father, as a little girl? Personal 
memories?  

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
10
 
A: The Œ there s Œ t he y™re so Œ I have several images that come to mind. One 
actually is an image of when m y mother was t aken. And, you know, how perfectly 

accurat
e this is, I don™t know, but Œ and I™ve written about this. I was Œ this would 
be 1943. So I was three years old. And the image that I have is my mother and I 

were home, by ourselves, and there was a knock at the door, and i t was two men, 
dressed in black, who came to the door and began to question her. And I was sort of 
hiding behind anot her door. And then they m ade her go with them. And so I ran up 

and sat on t he windowsill and looked down, and I saw her being put into a Œ a black 

car. It was a very fright ening image and experi ence, because it was the Gestapo 

coming to take her away. 

Q: Were you alone i n the house with her? 

A: I Œ I thought I was, I think I was. Whether I truly was or not, I don™t know. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But, I mean, whether I Œ whether that™s fact ual, I don™t know. But that™
s m y 

memory. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The Œ the other i mage that I have, in our apart ment, i s alwa ys not understanding 

why I would see peopl e coming i nto our building and out of our buil ding, going into 

a room, or an apart ment next door to our apart ment, and t hen never seeing them

again. Or, they would l eave, and then another man, woman, child, family, woul d 
come the next day. And in trying to understand why, as a three year old, I would 

constantly see strangers coming and going, well, it was because she was helping 

people get out of 
Berli n
. So she was part  of the underground. 

Q: Ah. 
A: In getting peopl e Œ probably both Roma and Jewish people, helping them escape. 
The i mage t hat I have of m y father was that he was red Œ red hair, or red and Œ with 

a red beard, possibly, or maybe just red hai r. And having a radio playing, and he 

would be tinkering wit h electrical t hings, with the radio, ma ybe building, taking it 

apart. And I later learned that he was an electrician. So pla ying with radios and 

things, and that there would be music pla yi ng on the radio. So, i n m y very earliest 

memories, those were kind of the memori es t hat I have. After a couple of years, 
after m y mother was taken Œ 
Q: Wa 
Œ di d she come back? 
A: Pardon me? 

Q: Did she come back? 

A: No. 

Q: Ever?  

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
12
 
A: Ne Œ well, what I know was that we were al l arrested, and we were incarcerated 
in the Œ the Jewish hospital. 

Q: And Œ 

A: But it was for about a month. We were al l t aken in March or April  of 1943. 

Q: And you woul d have been three and a half. 
A: Right. And I think we lived there for a couple of weeks, or a month. 
Q: Do you have any m emories of this? 

A: I don™t have memori es of that, no. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: This is what I™ve learned, but I don™t have memories of that. The memories t hat I 

have is that from 
Berlin
, at some point, we moved to a farm, or a fruit orchard, 
about 60 kilometers east of 
Berlin
.  
Q: East of 
Berlin
. 
A: East of 
Berlin
, so toward Œ towards the Russian zone. And alwa ys sort of 

playing by myself in a field, digging up potatoes. Why Œ why potatoes? Maybe 

that™s all there was in t he field. But being by myself. 

Q: Nobody around you. No brothers or si sters? 

A: The y were there, but I™m Œ I™m just tryi ng t o recall memories. And digging up 

potatoes because I was alwa ys hungry. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
13
 
Q: So you remember being hungry? 
A: Yeah. Cold and hungry, and al ways being alone. And Œ and then asking Œ alwa ys 

sayi ngto my sister, 
Gertrude
, I™m so alone. Or, why am I alwa ys al one? So, I 
know that there was another family living in hiding with us, or at least on the same 

property, and maybe there were chil dren, but  I have no recollection of being with 
other children. And maybe we did pla y together. I mean, here I was three or four 
years old, or four Œ four to five years old, and only thinking of m yself as being 

alone. 

Q: So, I want to st ep back a little bi t. The conclusion we can come to is that you had 

a mother for three and a half years, ma ybe, of your life. And then she disappears. 

A: Gone. Just out Œ out  Œ out of my life. But Œ but I still had all m y sisters and my 

brother. And my sister 
Gert
rude
, I think sort of filled the place of my mother. So I 
felt very close to her. And Œ and to this da y, I mean, she i s a very motherly, 

nurturing kind of person. And so, m y bond wit h m y siblings is primaril y to her, and 

to my brot her 
Alphonse
(ph). 

Q: I see. The two. The two of them. 

A: The Œ the two of them. The oth Œ the others are a little more peri pheral Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
14
 
A: Œ in Œ i n how they affected me. Because t hey Œ they were ta Œ you know, m y Œ 
m y brother was sort of the stand-in for m y father, perhaps. Older, and in charge, and 
I would look up t o him. My sister was Œ 
m y sister 
Gertrude
 was more of that Œ 
Q: Maternal person. 

A: Œ supportive Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ mothering rol e. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Another image t hat I have from that ti me was, we lived on thi s food orchard, or 

Œ or farm, for about a year and a half. That would be 1944, coming back to 
Berlin 
Œ 

coming back to 
Berlin
 at the Œ perhaps the beginning or ma ybe t he end of ninet Œ 

1945. 
Q: Beginni ng of 40 Œ 
A: The begi  Œ no, no, t he beginning of 1945, ahead of the Russians arm y, who were 

coming Œ marching into 
Berlin
. So we had to leave where we were, to get awa y 
from them coming back into 
Berlin
. And then I have very strong recollections of 

being on the street with m y father, watching soldiers coming down the street, and 

being very frightened. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
15
 
A: Because they were menacing l ooking. Dressed in black, just sort of like the two 
men that I had seen when m y mot her was taken. And wearing boots, and being, you 

know, loud and aggressive. And so there was a lot of  
fear.
 
Q: And it was winterti me. If you went back Œ it was winterti me Œ  

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in the beginni ng of ™45. Did you go back to the same apart ment t hat you had 
left from, or a different one? 

A: We went  back to the same building. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I don™t Œ I don™t  know if we went back t o the same apartment, because I think, at 

some point , our apartment was Œ the building was bombed out, so we may have 

moved int o the bui lding Œ into an apart ment next door. But, there were a lot of air 
raids. So either we would go to the bunker at the 
Alexanderplatz
, the un-
underground train stati on, which was probabl y only a Œ a block or t wo from our 
apartment. Or, we would go down into the bunker in the basement of our building, 

the shelter, and wait out the air raids. So the Œ the sounds of bombs falling, and 

noises, and planes overhead, again were, for a young Œ for me, sounds were very 

confusing and dist urbing. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
16
 
A: And ma ybe one of the reasons t hat I would ask m y si ster, why am I so alone, or 
I™m alwa ys alone, was because my mother was no longer there. My father was still 

in our life, but not my mother. 

Q: That was a question of mine. When you went to orchard Œ 

A: When we what? 
Q: When you went to the orchard, did you see your father? Was he around, in the 
same place?
 
A: He Œ 
he and m y brot herstayedin 
Berlin
 during the week, and t he y would come 
out on the weekends. 

Q: Ah, I see. 

A: Because he™d have found work, and so the y were able to Œ to work. He was an 

electrician. My brot her, I think, hel ped him wit h electrical work in t he city, but t hen 
the y would drive out with the man who owned the food orchard, on the weekends. 
So we did have time together. But I don™t Œ th -those kind of memories are too vague 

for me Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ to really be abl e to recollect. 

Q: Oka y. And do you know why you ended up in that food orchard, why you were 

there?  

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
17
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Why?
 
A: We™re in hiding, because we were Jews, and we knew Œ I-I knew. I felt that Œ 

that the world was against us, that there were people that didn™t want  us around. 

And in order to be safe, we had to go Œ you know, get out of 
Berlin
, and we had t o 
live in hidi ng, to not Œ to try not to be Jewish, not to be i dentified as Jews. 
Otherwise, we would not have survived. So the Œ the i mpression left on me was, at 

a very young age, to be deceptive. To not admit what I was and who I was. That 

extended from that ti me, until we had to declare ourselves as orphans, to be able to 

get from 
Germany
 to 
America
. Because had we a Œ had we said t hat  we had a 
father living at Œ we would not have been abl e to get on the first ship out, to come to 

the 
United States
. So having to l ie, so the I Œ and then once I was here, not want ing 
to admit at Œ or what Œ 
wantingto assi mil ate, because 
now the wa Œ t hen the war 
was over, and every Œ all the c Œ all  my classmates, and people that  I knew here, 
would make fun of m y German accent, the fact that I couldn™t speak English. The 

fact that I was German, and everybody in t he 
United States
 was agai nst 
Germany
, 
because of what 
Germany
 had done in t he war. So, denying what m y actual 
heritage was. 

Q: So in one sense Œ 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
18
 
A: So the i dea of deception and lyi ng was al most Œ al most second nature. 
Q: It was also reinforced, over and over. 

A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: It was reinforced over and over. First, because you™re Je
wish, and second 

because you™re German. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you have as Œ 

A: And to be a German Jew was t he worst, because you™re ji Œ yeah, number one, 

you™re German, so Œ and Œ and part of the German culture is to be very proud that 

you™re German. But  to be J
ewish, youknow, you™re 
Œ no Œ 
no matter what 
Œ what I 
was, we were Œ 

Q: You were wrong. 
A: Œ not accepted. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Do you have any sense of your mother™s i nfluence in your life, 

before she disappeared? Should I sa y that  louder? 

A: I Œ I don™t think so. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Well, I shouldn™t Œ t he Œ the influence that I recall Œ I mean, she was a Œ a kind 

person, but  I think I was probably more influenced by 
Gertrude
,  an d ma ybe by my 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
19
 
sister 
Ruth
, who woul d take me on excursions with her. So Œ and they were closer 
to my age, so I don™t know that I felt influenced by m y mother. 
Q: Well, it™s int Œ you know, it™s interesti ng and it™s also very heartbreaking, 

because bot h of your older sisters were chil dren themselves, you know. 

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Even 
Ruth
, the oldest Œ 
A: She was Œ 

Q: Œ was no more t han Œ 

A: She was 15 or 16. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. I mean it™s Œ at the end of the war, but in the begi nni ng, she™s a Œ in 

her early teens. She™s li ke 12, 13, or something like that. 

A: Right. 
Q: What about your father? Did you feel his presence? Did he have an influence on 
your life? Early life. 

A: An influence in the sense that yes, as a Œ I mentioned earlier, being on the street 

with hi m, and I have this image of standing sort of between his legs, with my arms 

wrapped around his legs, and Œ and looki ng kind of furtivel y down the street, 

watching these people. And whether there were trucks and tanks, or j ust soldiers

marching, I don™t know. But being in his embrace, so being protect ed by him, very 
much so. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But at t hat point, you know, m y mother was gone for a year and a half, so Œ 

Q: Yeah, this is the end of the war, when 
Germany
 capitulates.  
A: Yeah. I mean, it was very Œ 
it was 
very fri ghtening to see them, but then to at 
least know that m y father would protect me. 
Q: Do you remember l eaving 
Berl in
?  
A: I rem Œ 
I rem
ember being very confused, sort of like we were al ways going 
somewhere. We were going from 
Berlin
 out to the food orchard. We were going 
from our apart ment to t he bunker in the 
Al exanderplatz
. We were from our 

apartment, down below, into the shelter 
in our building, whereIthink weactually 
lived for a few days, or a week or so, because we had no apart ment to go back to. 
And then, going from 
Berlin
, on the train, from one place to anot her. And when I 
say fr
om one place t o another, we were going from 
DP
 camp to 
DP
 camp. So this Œ 
this sense of not belonging, of not s Œ sort  of being homel ess, because we were 

constantly in flux, and traveling, was both very, very confusing, and yet, I was still 

with my sisters and brother. So that was reassuring. But sort of not understanding 

why. If things were explained to me, I don™t remember the Œ any explanations. But I 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
21
 
think I alwa ys had the sense of why, or what™s going on. Not knowing, and being 
confused. And some of those feeling of insec Œ and the y were feelings of insecurity, 

ma y have played into Œ into why when I came to the 
States
, and came to the Jewish 

Children™s Bureau in 
Chicago
, who was our s-sponsor, and then having to go from 
one foster home to anot her foster home, and then finally, eventually,  l anding wit h a 
family who were a stable family, who wanted to adopt me. I embraced that. 

Q: You needed the stability. 

A: I needed the stabilit y and I Œ I needed to know that there were people who were 

going to take care of me from then on. And Œ and you know, provide warmth and 

love, and di scipline, which I didn™t want. 

Q: Who does? 

A: Yeah. Who does?  
Q: Yeah. 

A: And food. 

Q: Yeah.

Q: Oka y. 

A: So, all t he good things that chil Œ you know, and toys. And a Œ  and a yar Œ 
and a

Q: Do you remember anything of your tri p over from 
Germany
 to the 
United 
States
?  
A: I Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a few thi ngs. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But before talki ng about that, there™s another i mage that comes to mind, in 
Berlin
. And that i s Œ I was too young to go to school, although I may have been in 
nursery school for a short ti me. But this i mage of being on the st reet, standing i n 

line, and eit her getti ng a cup, or Œ either tin cups, or tin ladles of soup. And maybe it 

wasn™t really outsi de, ma ybe we were in Œ in the school building, and that™s how we 

got some l unch, or something. I Œ 
I 
don™t remember exactly. But t hat™s just that one 

sort of  one fleeting i mage. 

Q: Of having some food. 
A: Mm-hm, of Œ again, of food, which of course, is another way of being nurtured.  
Q: And sa yi ng that you must have been hungry, t o remember that i mage. 

A: Yeah. And Œ and you asked about being on the ship. I Œ I do Œ  I have memories, 

actually of Œ of going t o the galle y, to the kitchen. And I mean, I was Œ I was young, 

I was relat Œ  I was t he youngest, so probably t he Œ the crew were Œ 
wer
-were nice, 
and so aski ng or being given oranges, and fruit, or drinks, and then rushing back to 

our cabin, a nd handing them over.

Q: Tell me, how old were you? How old were you when you left 
Germany
? 
A: It would have been six. 
Q: You were six. You were six. 

A: And I t hink I was probably the type of child who would ingratiate herself. I 

knew how Œ I knew how to get people to like me, or give me things, like food. 
Q: Well, you know, how Œ the doctors sa y, or psychologi sts say that babies have a 
way of charming their parents, you know. Just  absolute Œ they need t o, for survival. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Absolutely need to, you know. And it™s not  conscious, it™s just there. 

A: It™s just  there. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And Œ 
A: And of course it  continued, once I got with m y adopti ve parent s. I really knew 

how to charm my dad. 

Q: Did you? 

A: And m y mom turned out to be the disciplinarian.  

Q: Well, tel l me about Œ well, when you came to the 
Uni ted States
, what happened 

then, before you get  to your adopti ve parents.

A: Well, the f Œ the first thing I Œ I remember i s being wakened very earl y in the 
morning, and saying, get dressed, we have t o go up on deck. And not  knowing why, 

but when we went up t here, the first thing that  we saw Œ that I saw, was the Statue 

of Libert y, which was Œ 

Q: Did you know Œ 
A: Œ 
pretty o 
Œ  
Q: Yeah. 
A: I™m not sure what I knew, except there was this very tall lady standing in the 

middle of the water. But the Œ but that it was wonderful, and everyone was cheering 

and applauding and screaming. And I thought the whole ship was going to capsize, 

because we were all on one side of the ship. So it began to list. So Œ but it Œ that was 

a very happy ti me. And then, getti ng off the ship, into this enormous warehouse, or 
holding area, on the Œ on the dock, and sort of being sectioned off into al most Œ I Œ I 
would almost describe it as a cattle pen, where you have fences separating groups. 

But it was Œ but it  was people. I mean, we weren™t treated as cattle, we were treated 

nicely. And having pictures taken. And I just m Œ sort of recoiled, I didn™t want Œ 

people were constantly taking pictures of us, of the seven of us. And t hen, moving 

from there at  some poi nt, to a building in the 
Bronx
, in 
New York
, and living there 
for Œ for a month, and going out one da y Œ I don™t know Œ I think we lived there for 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

a month in quarantine. And going out one da y, sort of Œ all of us lining up and going 
to a shoe store to get Œ to be given shoes. Who was in charge of us? I do Œ certainly 

Œ you know, adults that  were with t he 
HIAS
, or the Jewish Federation. 
Q: And why was your father not with you? Why was your father not with you? 

A: I Œ I didn™t Œ I didn™t know why. I™ve learned, of course, that Œ oh, I know why. 
Because the only way we could get here, as I had mentioned earlier, was to declare 
ourselves as orphaned Œ orphans.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: That both parent s had died, and this was the wa y we were going to be able to get 

out of 
Germany
. Because in 
Germany
, you know, there were shortages of 
everything. Buildi ngs were bombed out, there was rubble all over, there was no 

food available. So getting to 
America
 was going to be the thing you strived for, and 
we would not have been able to get out, if we had waited for our father to join us. 

Q: Had you Œ had anyone given you an explanation as to why your father wasn™t 

there, because that™s cl early an adul t explanation. What would you tel l a child as to 

why 
Papi
(ph) isn™t there? 

A: He™ll be coming. He™ll follow. We™re just going ahead now, he™ll come in a week 

or 10 da ys. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

A: Another image comes to mind, before Œ even before leaving 
Berli n
. And that is 
going with m y si ster 
Ruth
 to some building. Now, we were in the Russian sect or, 

going into a buildi ng and unbeknownst to me, she was meeting Œ we were there to 

meet with, I guess, representatives of the arm y, the 
U
.
S
. Arm y to see if we could get 
papers, so t hat we could begin the process of becoming 
DPs
, refugees, and 
eventually emigrati ng t-to the 
U
.
S
.  
Q: So she went from one zone to t he other?  

A: Pardon me? 

Q: She went from one zone to the other Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ she went from the Russian zone to the American. 

A: So we went from the Russian zone, int o the American or the Briti sh zone. But I 
believe we met with American personnel, and it was the first ti me that I saw a very 
tall man,whowasn™t my color
, and being afraid. But then as Œ going up to hi m, 

licking my finger, and running my finger down his cheek, thinki ng it was chocolate. 

Andhe picked me up, and 
Œ and he laughed, and then we became friendly, and I 
wasn™t afraid of him any more. So that was the Œ m y first recollection of seeing a 

black person, and that he was friendly. It was not someone to be afraid of. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

Q: Yeah. And so, we™re back in the 
Bronx
, and you™re with your sibli ngs, and you 
get some shoes. What happened after that? 
A: At some point, we got on a train Œ oh, on the ship, I was alwa ys throwing up. 

Even with these wonderful oranges that the crew were giving me, al ways seasick. 

Oh, to this da y, I get seasick. Anywa y, after getting the shoes, at some point we 
were put on a train, and we wound up in 
Chicago
. And getting off the train, and 
going to a building downtown, which was the Jewish Children™s Bureau, of the 
Jewish Federation. I was plopped up on a tabl e, or a desk, or somethi ng. And again, 

we were lined up, gi ven ice cream, and a doll. So Œ and posing for more pictures. 

And then, getting i nto a taxicab, and one by one, we were each dropped off at a 

foster home. 

Q: A different foster home. 
A: Different foster home, and it was the first time, after all these years of being 
together Œ m y brot her would wal k each of us up to a foster home, I think either Œ 

either my brother, or my brother and the social  worker who was with us. And I Œ 

again, I didn™t understand why, but told t hat we were going to be with these peopl e, 

who would take care of you. Well, the first foster home I was in, I liked the man, 

but I didn™t like the woman. And my sist er 
Ruth
 came to see me, and I told her t hat 

she beat me, that the woman took away m y doll, and what ever toys there were, and 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

shewould beat me inthebathtub. Andso m y sisteri mmediately cont actedthe 
ca
seworker, got me out  of there. At which point I went to li
vewi th my sister 
René
, 
who was i n a foster home wi Œ and her foster parents were 
Ruth
 and
 
Ben 
Carleton
(ph). And they were very nice people. And then, at some Œ I don™t think I 

lived with her that l ong, but we di d go to the same school. We went to 
Sha kespe
are
 
Elementary School for a very short  ti me, ma ybe just a couple of weeks that I was 

there. And then there were two people Œ some Œ somehow, and this gets confusing, I 

was back at the Jewi sh Children™s Bureau, or somewhere, where these two people 

came and 
talked to me. And I was in Œ perhaps the caseworker asked if I would like 

to go and be with t hem, and spend the night, or see how things worked out. And I 

liked those people, and they became m y adoptive parents. 

Q: What were their names? 
A: 
Rosali nd
 and 
Joshua Spiegel
. They were not interested in being foster parents. 
The y wanted to be adoptive parent s. My father, 
Joshua Spiegel
, was a 
neurosurgeon. He had operated on 
Mary Lawrence
, who was t he director of the 
Jewish Children™s Bureau. And at some point he had said to her, we are interested 

in adopting a child. And so, when we came through the 
JCB
, she thought perhaps I 

would be a good candi date. I was still young. I was only, you know, six and a half 

at the time. I™d Œ so I li ved with them for a while, and when the y asked me if I 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

29
 
wanted to be adopted, I didn™t know Œ I di dn™t know any better, I said, oh yeah, 
these are nice people, okay. I woul d like that. 

Q: Did they know that you ha Œ you had a living father? 

A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: Did they know you had a living father? 
A: I told them no, but of course the y knew. Every Œ all of this Œ I mean, I Œ for a 
long ti me, I lived thinking that nobody knew t hat our father was li ving. But the 
JCB
 
knew, everybody knew. 

Q: How do you know t hey knew? 

A: In papers that I™ve seen since then. So t he y were compli cit in a good wa y. They 

Œ they want ed us t o have good lives. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But Œ and at that time Œ this was, you know, 1946, the rules for adoption, and the 
best thinki ng of social workers and psychologists, was that no contact was to be 

mai ntained with famili es of origin, because it would be t oo difficult Œ 

Q: Can we cut? 
[break]
 So you were talking about the ki nd of thinking that was 

going on at the ti me. Tha Œ about Œ  

A: Thinking about  adoption and foster care, and the thinking at t hat t ime was, 

number one, document s were not public. Everyt hing that  was done was hidden

away. So, i t Œ which ki nd of played into m y earlier menti oning of deception, and 
sort of Œ and rather t han overt deception, it ™s hiding, keeping thi n
gs private.
 
Q: Yes. 

A: Not talking about things, and sort of keeping things hi dden awa y from view. So 

once I moved in wi th the 
Spieg els
, I actually saw my sisters and brother Œ probably 
more my sisters, several of them, quite a bi t. But m y mot her, of cours
e 
Œ not of 
course, m y mother, 
Rosalind Spiegel
 was in consultation both with t he social 
workers at the Jewi sh Children™s Bureau, and with a psychiatrist who recommended 

that contact with m y si blings be discontinued, because I was too confused. When 

m y sist
er would come over, there was always talk about don™t forget Mama, don™t 

forget Papa. We™re all t ogether, don™t forget them. So, of course, I would want to be 

with them. Then, when I was with these foster people, soon to become m y adopt ive 
parents, it was difficult to relate to them. And I think I would lash out at them, or 
act out, especially towards my mother, m y fost er mother 
Rosalind
. And she was 

then advised to stop contact. Now, when I sa y contact, ma ybe the y came what, two 

or three ti mes, and t hen it was decided that Œ I mean, I was too young to really make 

a choice, but  it was decided that it would be in m y best interest to identify with this 

new family, so that they could become m y family, so that I would be given the 

opportunity, you know, to have a st able home life, and not be torn bet ween m y

loyalty to m y German siblings, and my loyalty to m y new American fami ly. I did 
not have access to my papers, my German papers until I was an adul t. So this would 

be 1958, 1960. And even then, when I called t he Jewish Children™s Bureau to sa y,  I 

want to see m y case file, the y gave me a very hard ti me. This is not public. I said, 

I™m not public, thi s is my case file. And I had to sort of argue wit h them, before 
they finall y released the files. 
Q: And what did you learn in those files? 

A: What di d I learn? I l earned that my father had remarried, my Germ an father had 

remarried. I learned that the Jewish Children™s Bureau knew that m y father was 

living. I Œ I don™t t hink I learned too much more than that, but I knew Œ I learned 

that the 
JCB
 knew that I didn™t have to be hidi ng the fact that I had a father living 

in 
Germany
 all these years. I didn™t have t o continue the deception. 
Q: Oh, that must have been a burden. 

A: It was a Œ 

Q: That must have burden Œ  

A: It was Œ  it was a terrible burden. It was a burden because Œ and Œ and the burden 

continued for many ye ars, because I felt this t remendous loyalty towards my 

American parents. But I also had this desi re to know about m y German family. I 

knew that t he y all lived in 
Chicago
. What  I di dn™t know, was not onl y did they 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

know where I lived, they knew what I was doing, where I went to school. They 
would some Œ they would sort of keep tabs on me. They Œ i-i-in a Œ i n a good way, 

they wanted to make sure everything was oka y. I remember I went to the University 

of 
Chicago
 Laboratory Schools. I remember Œ and tha Œ I was now in high school. I 

remember going down the street with my classmat es, we were going from one 
building a couple of bl ocks awa y, to another building, t urning around and seeing 
some young women ki nd of following Œ following us. And I had no i dea why. Well, 

it was two of m y sisters. We all li ved on the south side of 
Chicago
, not too far away 

from each ot her. The y were Œ the y saw me on the street, and were foll owi
ng me. I 

mean, there was not hing bad about that Œ 

Q: No. 

A: Œ except that I was with this new fami ly. I hadn™t seen them now i n seven or 
eight years, and I di dn™t Œ and I wasn™t sure, I wasn™t positive of who the y were.  
Q: Were you ever told by your adoptive parents that you could not have contact 

with your siblings?
 
A: It was Œ  it was i mpli ed. You have a new family. You have Œ you have to learn a 

Œ you have to learn a new language. You are now an American, you™re not a Œ 

you™re not German. You know, it was very exciting ti me for me to be Œ to get Œ 
I 

was a naturalized citi zen. In 1951, 
I became a 
U
.
S
. citizen, that™s a big time. But the 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

33
 
implication was pretty clear. Oh, at Œ that it  would be bet ter for me to make m y Œ to 
sort of make my all egiance to this f
amily.
 
Q: So in other words, t hey Œ they put it gi Œ you know, and the way you are 
explaining it is, with the best of intentions, but the wa y the y put it, it™s either us or 
them, and it shoul d be us. 
A: It Œ yes. Now, it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t Œ I wasn™t given the option, you can go back 
to them, and then it  won™t be us. It  wasn™t that . It was, you™re here, you™re our 

daughter, we love you, we™ll take care of you. This is the wa y it shoul d be. And, 

because of the acting out that I had been doing Œ I™m not  exactly sure what acting 

out I was doing, except  I was probably Œ 

Q: You were Œ you were being a kid. 
A: Œ disobe ying, or disrespectful, particularly to my mother. I adored my father. I 
adored him, because he, of course, was a pushover. Gave me everyt hi ng. Would 
take me to t he park, we™d go kite flying. He would take me to 
Michael Weiss
 

Hospital on Sunday mornings, where he made rounds of his patients, while I was in 

the telephone operat ors™ room wit h all the operators, and so you know, I was like 

this little da
rling. And 
Œ and the y would Œ they would pl a y with me at Œ 
etcetera. 

But because of all this confusion, my mother took me to a psychi atrist. So I was in 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

therapy, and I hated that therapy. And the psychiatrist, her name was 
Emmy 
Sylvester
(ph), who I believe had emigrated from 
Germany
 as well.  
Q: She mi ght have had a few issues, you know? 
A: What?
 
Q: She mi ght have had a few issues. 
A: She mi ght have had a few issues. She would, of course, try to get me to talk 
about m y feelings, etcetera, etcetera, and I just wanted to play with whatever it was 

I was Œ either Œ I wasn™t much of Œ into pl a ying with doll s, but buildi ng things and 

other Œ other kinds of toys. And so I really never wanted t o talk t o her, but was 

forced to do so. The ot her thing that m y adopt ive parents gave me, that was sort of a 

lifesaver with me, was dance lessons. And Œ which I woul d never have had the 

opportunity to do. I came from a very poor family, into now a very well-to-do 
family. And I was given every advantage. I went to Œ I st arted out at a public 
grammar school, but then, after a few years, went to a private high school. And one 

of the very best uni versities, not only in this Œ in Œ in the country. Recognized 

around the Œ around the world. There was never a question of whether there would 

be enough food. I was, however, very malnourished. I think we al l were, with rott en 

teeth, and you know, no Œ no healt hcare to speak of. And m y parents, the 
Spiegels
, 
would ply me wit h food. Well, I would si t at the table, and I was a tiny little girl. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
35
 
Not so tiny any more, but then I was tiny. Filled my mouth with food, and excused 
m yself to go to the bat hroom. And finally Œ and then I™d come back and I™d eat 

more food, excuse myself again. I was flushing it down t he toilet . 

Q: Oh m y. 

A: Cu Œ and they Œ it was discovered because either m y mother or father went int o 
the bathroom after I came back at Œ at some point, and saw that I was flushing food 
down the toilet. A natural question would be, why didn™t you just stop eating? Well, 

it was pretty early i ngrained upon me that I should be grateful for whatever I was 

given. I think I learned that in the first foster home, that I was Œ t hat I was in. Be 

thankful and be grat eful. Be quiet, and don™t cause trouble. So I was sort of this 

little

, who acted out secretl y, and in a secretive way. I never 
remember once Œ when a child is angry, what does a child do?  
Q: You Œ 
you 
Œ 
A: Œ to her or his parents? 
Q: You yel l at them. 

A: You what? You™re mad at them. 

Q: You™re mad at them. 

A: Not I. I could ne
ver be madat m y parent s.
 So I did it in a Œ i n an underhanded 
way, more subterfuge. Because I couldn™t sa y, I don™t like what you™re doing, or 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

36
 
I™m angry at  you. I could never be that open, because I had to be grateful, because 
they took me in, and they adopted me, and they gave me t his wonderful life. So 

there was al ways thi s confusion of, can I be who I am? Can I be m yself? 

Q: Did you come to an answer? 

A: Because I have to be grateful. 
Q: Did you ever come to an answer as to whether you could be? 
A: I di
dn™t hear you.
 

Q: Did you ever come to an answer as to whether you were allowed t o be yourself? 

A: Not for many years. Not for many years. It was Œ it was very hard. So Œ and a Œ 

and when I sa y many years, I mean after I had children of m y own. After I was 

married and had chil dren. I remember in my new family, we adopted Œ m y parents 

adopted two more chil dren. So I had a brother, 
Jonathan
, who was nine and a half 
years younger than I. And then Œ and he was from the 
U
.
S
., but he had been 
abandoned. And then 
m y sister 
Petra
, who was 12 years younger than I, who had 
been Œ she was Italian, and lived i n an Italian orphanage, because her parents could 
not take care of her. And I™ve lost my train of thought.  

Q: You had Œ you were sa ying that  Œ 
A: Oh, I Œ I just re membered. My brother 
Jonathan
 once said Œ he was probably 
five or six, or ma ybe a little bit ol der. I wa Œ I was in the room, and Œ and he said to 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
37
 
m y mother, I hate you. Now, at that Œ if he was five or six, I was about 15. And I 
said to my mother, how could you let hi m say that? How could you possibly let hi m 

say that 
to you? And she looked at me, and she said, he™s angry. Of course he hates 
me at the moment, because I didn™t give him candy, or whatever i t was. It™s Œ it™s 

perfectly nat ural. And I didn™t think that was right. He was adopted, he should be 
grateful. Because that™s what I had been tol d. 
Q: What a burden. What a burden, you know? 

A: It was. It is what Œ and it is what kept me, because of these dual loyalt ies, it i s 

what kept me from reconnectin
g with m y s
-si sters and brother. There was one time, 

when I was still in high school, probably a juni or or a seni or. My parents Œ we, as a 

family went  out for dinners, usually on Thursday night or something. I went to this 

favorite Chinese restaurant. And we left the restaurant to walk home, and I saw four 
people, you know, just walking down the street. And I remember l ooking at this 
man, just staring at  him as we walked past each other, and he was staring at me. It 

was my father from 
Germany
, and his new family. I didn™t know it, quite, at the 
time, except  that I kept staring at him, wondering who he was, and why I felt this 

connection to him. But he had given up hi s rights to me, that in order for me to be 

adopted, the Jewish Children™s Bureau, I t hink it 
wasthe bureau, had placed 
Œ 
placed an ad in the paper at the time, in 1946 or ™47, sa yi ng that unless you clai m

rights to this child, she will be placed for adoption. So he gave up his rights to me, 
which meant no contact. You cannot have contact with her. That was the law in 

1946. You know, that was just the Œ 

Q: Did you ever see him again? 

A: I never saw hi m again, no. In Œ in 19 Œ he came here in 1956 Œ 1956. So about 
that ti me Œ about that ti me, and I di d not know that he was here, but about that time, 
I was studyi ng dance downtown, and after class I came downstairs. This was 

downtown, came downstairs to go and take the train to go home, and there was this 

young woman on t he st reet who came up to me, and I sort of looked at her, and I 

said, I™m not allowed to talk to you. It was my sister 
Ruth
. I couldn™t remember her 

n ame.
 
Q: Oh. 
A: She had gone up to my dance st udio, talked with the dance direct or, told her who 
she was. The dance director i mmediately, you know, had her go into another room, 

called my father and said, there™s a young woman here who says she™s 
Ginger
™
s
 
sister. Who is she? My parents had never told t he dance director my background. 

He then apparently contacted the Jewish Children™s Bureau, who contacted my 

sister and said, if you ever go n
ear 
Ginger Œ Bela
 again, you™ll be sent back. There

was this fear, sort of hanging over all of us, that if you don™t behave, you™re going 
to be sent back. 

Q: Oh, how sad. 

A: So there were these conflicting feelings. I believe when I was about 18 or 19, m y 

mother said to me, if you ever want to know about your family, j ust ask me, or let 
me know, or if you want to contact them, I will arrange it. And at that ti me I sai d, I 
have my new family. It ™s okay. I can™t have loyalties to both. When I was engaged 

to be married, I was 20, I was contacted Œ I got a letter, I Œ I guess, about German 

reparations. And so I met with someone and signed the papers, and turned over 

what mone y I got. And this was for the death of m y mot her. So the German 

government  made reparations. I got a check for 39 dollars. And I i mmediately 

signed it over to the Jewish Chil dren™s B ureau. You know, I Œ 
I 
Œ 
I wantedno part 
of it. But basically, that was the only contact that I had wi th m y 
family, my 
Œ 
m y 
German family. A month or two before I got married Œ 
at that time, 1960, you had 
to get 
[indecipherable]
 health certificate. So I went to m y pediatrician, to si Œ e-

everyone di d. Before you could get a marri age license, you had to be Œ make sure 

that you were Œ did not have venereal disease, or other heal th issues. And so I went 

to my pedi atrician, got whateverdocument I 
Œ I needed, and two women came up to 
me and said, are you 
Ginger
? I said yes. Well, can we talk to you for a minute? We

went into Œ  
down thehall,andit was my sister 
René
, 
and m y sist 
Œ I Œ I think Œ and 
I don™t know why, but I™m saying 
Gertrude
, but it might not have been. Anywa y, 
we went down the hall, and they said, we saw in the newspaper that you™re getting 
married, and we just wanted to wish you all the best. 

Q: Oh. 
A: And I i mmediat e recognized 
René
, because she had red hair. And I said Œ but, I 
was kind of embarrassed, because I had not contacted them, or made any effort to 
contact them, to tell them I was get ting married. And you know, I was 19 or 20 

years old at the ti me. I was not a child any longer. But the y did sa y, we just wanted 

Œ we Œ 
we hope 
Œ we hope you™re oka y, and t hat you™re happy, et cetera, etcetera. 
And the y were married, they had children of their own. And a few years later, I got 

a phone call from one of m y sisters, 
J udy
, who said, I™m moving to 
Lawrence
, 
Kansas
, and I™d Œ before Œ and I don™t know that I™ll ever be back. I™d like to see 

you. So I said, sure. So she came. I, at this poi nt, had a chi ld. She came to m y 

apartment, and I opened Œ I never forget this, I opened the door, and for the first 

time in my memory, I looked at someone who looked just  like me. Which was very 

interesting, in that Œ you know, I l ooked at my child, or m y children, t hey didn™t 
look like me. I didn™t look like my adoptive mother. I di dn™t look like m y sister or 

brother. So here was somebody from m y past, who looked like me. So Œ

Q: What a price. 
A: Œ and Œ and Œ and still Œ and still I mai ntained Œ and I Œ I Œ I remember talking 

with my husband, should I reconnect with my family? And he advised against it . He 

said, you™re gonna sort of open up a can of worms. You™ve got this family. And I 

have relatives in 
Canada
, I mean, the f Œ 
you know, 
and new cousins here. So it 
was Œ it was hard. I didn™t realize how difficult it was on m y sisters, and brother.  

Q: The y were kind of hovering, like Œ 
the y werehovering like 
Œ 
li ke guardian 
angels. 

A: The y were Œ 
the y were 
hovering angels, and yet the y couldn™t acknowledge 
themselves. Two of them once came into the a-apart ment building where I lived 

with my parents, and they almost rang the doorbell, and then they ran away instead. 

So it was Œ yeah, t he y Œ they sort of kept Œ kept an e ye on me, in Œ in Œ 
Q: Which i s a lovely, wonderful thing. 

A: Fabulous. Fabulous. Many years later Œ oh, oh, and every once i n 

[indecipherable]
 about every five years, once I was an adult, I had contact with 

them, through the Œ I-I™d get a letter, or a card, or something. It t urns out that m y 

sister 
René
 went to the same high school that m y husband went to. They both went 
to 
Hyde Park
, on the south side. I don™t know that the y knew Œ I don™t think the y 

knew each other, but they Œ you know, there was always somethi ng. I received

some letters, some were nice, some were not so nice. But I Œ because I did questi on, 
should I contact them, what shoul d I Œ and Œ and it was sort of, you™ve just got t oo 

much going on in your life. You™ve got your own family, you™ve got your children, 

you™ve got your adopted brother and sister, you™ve got your parents. How many 

things, yo
u know, can you handle? I became disabled in 1984, and shortly 
thereafter, I don™t know what possessed me, but shortly thereafter, I called and 

made a lunch date with 
Mary Lawrence
, the director of the Jewish Children™s 

Bureau. We hadlunch downtown
. And s he too had sort of kept tabs on me, because 
she orchestrated the adoptions of m y brother and sister, as well as me. And she said, 

well, tell me what™s going on in your life, and how™s your German family? And I 

said, well, I don™t have contact with them. Well, why not? Or, when are you going 

to call them? And I sai d, well Œ 
anywa y, a
- and so I Œ we got on to ot her subjects. 
So, after thinking about  that for maybe six months, I picked up t he phone. I™ve had 

Œ I™d had a New Year™s card from my sister 
G ertrude
, that I™d had for 10 years or 
so. I saw a phone number on the back of the envelope, and I said, okay, and I made 

a phone call. I had Œ so I had a phone number, which meant that I had made a phone 

call 10 years before, probably, and there was no answer. So this time would be 

about a year or two after m y accident. I saw that card, picked up t he phone and 

made a phone call. And it Œ at about lunchti me Œ I remember this very clearly, and 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

somebody answered the phone and said hello, and I said, 
Ma nya
? And she said Œ 
she just 
[sha rp inha le]
 and the first words out of her mouth were, why now? And I 
said Œ 
this is my sister 
Gertrude
 Œ  and I said to her, well, I tried to call you 10 years 
ago, but there was no answer. And she said, do you mean if I hadn™t picked up t he 

phone now, it would be another 10 years? And I said, yeah. So, I Œ I mean, she Œ 
you know, sh-she was i n such shock. Immediately called my brother, who called 
me, and he drove to 
Chicago
 I think two da ys later. I had not seen hi m now, si nce 

1946. 

Q: So this is like 40 years. 

A: Forty years. 

Q:Oh m y gosh.
 

A: He and I created a bond that was really quit e deep, and Œ and profound. And 
unfortunately, he just passed awa y, two weeks ago. So, sort of what t he whole 
family saga turns into was that, the y would say t hat after wandering in the desert for 

40 years, I came back. And I Œ we had a famil y reunion, after Œ 
a 40
th
 reunion, and 
then 10 years later at my home, we had a 50
th
 anniversary party of comi ng to 
America
, so that woul d be 1996. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: And so, you 
know, we™ve maintained a

A: Yes. 

Q: Are they part of your life now? 

A: Yes. Again, the two most i mportant people, 
Gertrude 
and 
Al phonse
(ph), have 
been more a part of m y life than the Œ than the others. Just because it Œ there™s just a 
closer bond. You know, you Œ you™re not going to be equal with every Œ  
every 
member of your family. But al Œ al Œ I would t ravel to 
D
.
C
. to see him, he would 
come here. He would have meetings, and Œ 

Q: Did you ev Œ were your adoptive parents still alive when you reconnected? 

A: Yes, yes, the y were. And one ti me, he was in town, and there was a party at m y 

aunt and uncle™s house Œ m y American aunt and uncle™s. And we Œ and I-I-I said, 

can I Œ 
can 
Alphonse
(ph) come wit h me? Of co
urse.So he met m y parents,andhe 
asked my father, 
Joshua Spiegel
 if he could talk with hi m privately. They went 

down to the basement and afterwards, I asked my father, I said, what did 

Alphonse
(ph) say to you? And he said, he thanked me – he thanked Œ he thanked 
me for givi ng you a life, for providing you wi th a home and opportunities, and 

establishing a family. And, I mean, here was m y brother, who had his own family, 

who was such a 
mens ch 
as to go up to my fat her and thank him for being my father. 
Q: Wo
w. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
45
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Wow.
 

A: That perhaps gi ve you a tiny i nsight into the kind of man that m y brother was. A 

man who was a fisit Œ brilliant physicist, had a deep sense of history, who was very 

German, had a Œ loved music and literature. Had al most gone to t he 
University of 
Chicago
, because he was offered a scholarshi p, but because of his interest in 

science and math, deci ded to go t o the 
Ill inois 
Institute of Technology, and become 

a physicist. He and I would have long talks, and he was so sorry in his later years 

that he didn™t take up the offer of going to University of 
Chicago
, you know, and 

learning many 
Œ much more of the humani ties. But he is a man who married out side 
his Jewish faith, fell in love, raised a family, di d not really practice his Judaism for 

many years. The chi ldren were raised Catholic. But I believe he felt a disconnect 
with his wife and chi Œ and children because of Œ not only the reli gious differences, 
but the cult ural differences of all of us. I mean, I™m very Americanized. 
Gertrude
 
is pretty much Americanized. 
Alphonse
(ph) never was. He was 18 when he came 

here, so rema Œ remained very German. 

Q: European. Very mu Œ very European. 

A: Very European. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
46
 
A: Very European. And Œ and yet, you know, tremendous loyalty and love for his Œ 
his family. He lived in 
Gaithersburg
, 
Maryland
. He got his, you know, degree 
here in 
Chi cago
, moved to 
Toronto
 for his post-doctoral work, then his fam Œ 

moved with his family to 
New York
 for a number of years, and then to 
D
.
C
. to 

work for the government. The Nati onal Institute of Œ of Œ National Bureau of 
Standards, now call ed 
NIST
. For many years did a lot of research int o physics and 
Raman
 spectroscopy in particular. But, in a different way, had many of the same 
conflicts that I had. 

Q: Really? Really?  

A: If I™m thinking about it now, m y conflicts were not over religion, but over two 

different worlds; a German world, and an American world; German family, and an 

American family. His conflicts were more over a German heritage. 
Q: Jewish German heri tage, or German heritage? 
A: You know, there is Œ I mean, German Jews considered themsel ves German. So i-

it™s not Œ t here Œ there™s a combination of a German heritage, and a German Jewish 

heritage. It™s a little hard to explain, unless you™re there. So, I mean, he Œ you know, 

his eldest son, he named 
Karl
, 
k- a-r-l
, who, i n his adult hood became, and is, a 

Lutheran minister. The family ma 
Œ moved away from Catholicism, and became 

Episcopalian, but t hen 
Karl
 became a Lutheran minister. So the Œ there Œ these Œ

these conflicts of Œ of dual loyalty Œ 
I mean, 
Alpho nse
(ph)
 
was fluent  in German, 
knew a lot of German songs. Steeped hi mself in the Œ the Œ the poetry of Œ of 
Goethe
 and 
Rilke 
and Œ and Œ and 
Schubert
, and you know, just Œ and Œ and felt 
that there was nothi ng better than a German education, because it was the Germans 

who really i mplemented higher education. Very proud of that. And yet Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ was denied a good part of his own education because he was Jewish. So these 

Œ these conflict Œ and t he conflict in his own marriage, and sadly, we would talk Œ I 

mean, he did not practi ce any religi on of any kind for many years. And about 10 

years ago Œ and I woul d talk to hi m about that . I mean, I Œ I don™t consider myself a 

religious Jew, but more of a cultural Jew, but I would Œ I Œ certainly I went to Œ t o Œ 

to religious school , and became confirmed, and Œ cause girls were not Bat Mitzvah 
when I was growing up. My children have been raised in a Œ in a Jewi sh home. But 
it wasn™t until 10 years ago that 
Al pho nse
(ph) r
eturned to his Jewish roots and 
began to go to synagogue. And not only began to go to synagogue, but really

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ did you ever feel anger at your adoptive parents, for the fact that the y cut them 

off?  

A: You know, that™s a Œ that™s an i nteresti ng question. I Œ actually, there was a ti me 

when I felt anger towards m y birt h father, because he gave up his rights to me. And 
I said to m yself, how could he do this? He disowned me. And then I would have to 
talk to myself, and say, he did this for m y benefit. Number one, he di d not think he 

was ever going to get t o the 
United States
. 

Q: Is that the case? 

A: That is the case. I Œ I Œ I believe that is t he case. Now, he signed t hose rights 

away in 1946, so that I could be adopted, or maybe it was ™47. At which point, I™m 

not sure exactly when, but he remarried. He had a stepdaughter, and together he and 
his wife had a son. That™s my half-brother 
Harry
. 
Q: Have you met him? 
A: Oh yes.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yes. 
H arry
. And my stepsister is 
Gitta

Brigitta

Gitta

she and I are about six months apart in age, yes. And Œ and the y™re Œ you know, 

they™re lovely people. So I have met them a Œ a number of ti mes. When I had, at my

home, the 50
th

Harry

and 
Gitta
(ph)andher husband. AndI™ve met th 
Œ 
Gitta
(ph)
 
and Œ and her 
husband™s children.
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: So I Œ 
I 
Œ initially I felt anger towards m y father, 
Alexander
, but then I would 
say, I know he did this because he wanted you to ha Œ you, 
Ginger
, t o have a life. 
Q: Now, do you Œ did your siblings Œ did you ever talk about this with your 

siblings, and did t he y ever fill in any informati on? 

A: The y had a lot of anger towards my adopti ve parents, absolutely. I will try t o 

explain Œ in fact, I s Œ I think I still have letters that we exchanged, where I was 

explaining to them why m y parent s did what t hey did. The y didn™t do it because ab 

Œ out of dislike of them, they did i t because they felt this would be in m y best 
interests, and the y were advised to do it by professionals. So they thought that t his 
would be in my best interests. But there was a lot of anger, yes, and Œ and perhaps 

some resentment. It  Œ but I Œ I think we™re be yond that. 

Q: Yeah, that was going to be m y next question. 

A: And past that. 

Q: Has it been put to rest? 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane

50
 
A: Yes, oh yes, definitely been put to rest, and Œ and when Œ you know, so e-
everything i s fine. I Œ I think maybe someti mes I felt some ambivalence toward m y 

adoptive parents. Not anger. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But I Œ I™m not a person who f Œ at Œ who feels a lot of anger, or admits to a lot 
of anger. It™s a little Œ i t Œ it goes a little more underground with me. But Œ and I 
never Œ I never felt unhappy or Œ or questi oned why the y did what  they did, as I Œ I 

didn™t think that there were ulterior motives. I knew that what the y did was out of 

concern for me. I did di scuss, after m y sist er 
Judy
 had come to see me, before she 
moved to 
Lawrence
, and told me the stories of sitting around the tabl e with the 
family, that, number one, my father and his new family had come to t he 
States
, 

which I had not known, and that t he y Œ when t hey would occasionally get together, 
the y would say how ni ce it was, how wonderful it was that all the family were 
together, except for Mama and 
Bela
. Well, thatdid 
a guilt trip on me that was pretty 
profound. I do remember talking t o m y father, and kind of feeling him out, and 

asking hi m if he thought I should contact m y German father. And he said Œ because 

I wanted to find Œ I Œ when I say I was feeling him out, I wanted to know, or get a 

feeling of whether he would feel that I didn™t  care for him, or if it would hurt hi m if 

I contacted my German father. And he said to me Œ he™s a very wi se man Œ he said, 

 
Interview with Ginger Lane  
 
September 28, 2016 
 
 
 
51
 
probably Œ no, he said, if you contact him, you should do it with the knowledge t hat 
you will continue a relationship with hi m. Don™t do it out of curiosity and then 

never see hi m again. That would be cruel. 

Q: That™s very kind. 

A: It would not be right Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ 
for youtodo that. If you makea 
Œ a connection with hi m, you need to follow 
through on that connection with your father, and with your sibli ngs, he said, My 

advice to you woul d be to not do i t, because you™ll be opening up a can of worms. 

You have your own family, you have your husband, you have one or two chi Œ 
I 

don™t remember how many children I had at  that point. You know, you have this 

whole west ern, Americanized family. It™s a lot for you to take on. I read into that , 
that he would be hurt, so I never did, until after I became disabled and decided I 
needed to look at my li fe. 

Q: And

aven™t you

Q: Yeah. 
A: And yes, an-and that made me examine myself a little bit more and sa y, stand up 
and do what™s right . 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You need to connect with them. But i n terms of m y American father, the Œ 
m y 
mother had already given me permi ssion, but I needed Œ I needed to hear from them 

Œ from m y father Œ 
cause my moth 
Œ m y German mother was gone. 
Q: That™s ri ght. 
A: So she would not be threatened. I was concerned that m y father would be 
threatened. 
So ,
 you know, we each bring so much to any conversati on. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: A lot of internal feelings that Œ 
thataren™texpressed. Once he met m y bro

generosity, and by their connec
ting witheach other.Now, m y

died in 1970 Œ 1969 or 1970. I did have a l ot of guilt feelings about n-never seeing 
hi m again. I -I-I thou Œ I mean, I didn™t know at the ti me that he had di ed, but later Œ  

Q: Yeah.  

A: Œ I Œ I had some guilt feelings. But I think I dealt with them, or overcame some 

of them by reconnecting, in particular with 
Al pho nse
(ph), and having, you know, 
the Œ this warm, loving relationship with hi m in Œ highly intelligent, highly sensi tive 

man who Œ who had a l ot of warmt h and a lot of love to share.  

Q: Clear Œ clearly Œ clearl y that he would have still felt the Œ the sort of almost l ike 

primal responsibili ty for his youngest sister, even when he hadn™t ha Œ when he had 

been torn awa y from her, you know. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: To still have that feeling, and t o Œ 
A: Oh Œ 
Q: Œ be thankful for what other people did for you.  

A: Yes. And I mean, he Œ he never chided me for why haven™t you kept contact 

with us. He embraced me wholeheartedly, and sort of Œ as though I was, you know,

very nicely. 

Q: As a side note, none of your ot her siblings had this kind of situation? In all of the 

other places the y were fostered or adopted, they Œ  their contact to one another was 
not Œ 
A: The y never lost cont act with each other, no.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: It was Œ  because they weren™t adopted. It was only the process of adoption, I 

think, that kept us Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ from each other. And you know, a Œ and a lot of that might have been m y 
doing as well, because I wanted thi s new famil y, which turned out to get bigger and 
bigger, and cousins here and cou Œ you know, cousins in 
Cleveland
 and cousins in 
Canada
 and m y fa Œ 
my American

A:Now, m y sister

 was offered adoption, and she sai d no. So, maybe her ties 
were st Œ she was older than I, but ma ybe her ties were stronger than mine. Ma ybe I 
was a little more selfish, or a little more thinking of what™s going to work Œ what™s 

going to work for me.

Q: Yeah. 
A: And so I was a little bit afraid of him. And yet, I menti oned that he Œ 

Q: Protected. 

A: Œ protect ed me. I was never afraid of 
Alphonse
(ph). He was not Œ t o me, he was 
never an intimidating figure. I think, to some of m y other siblings, he was a little 
bit. Very bright, very Œ in some ways, he could be authori tarian. And Œ so when I 
came back i
nto the picture, it was sort of this big lovefest, rather than ma ybe seeing 
all of the realities that are out there. But Œ 
but we 
Œ I mean, we all had strong 
feelings for him. 

Q: Yeah, but you ne Œ 

A: The y were different. 

Q: Œ the siblings never held it ag
ai nst you that you 
Œ your other siblings never held 
it against you, or did they Œ was there any resent ment why you had not gotten in 

contact?  

A: You Œ 
ye 
Œ your Œ t hey never held it against me, well, I think there was some 
resent ment. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I was gi ven opportunities the y were not  given. I stepped awa y from t he family, 

whether by choice or not, the resul t was, I did step awa y, I Œ I mean, I was awa y

from the family. Certai nl y once I was an adult, once I was 20 or 25, I could have 
reconnected with them,  and I didn™t. I did not reconnect with them unt il I was in my 

40s. Why not? So yes, I think there have been some Œ some feelings of why didn™t 

you. But again, at t his point, that™s in the past. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: We™ve dealt with it. I™ve explained my posi tions, they™ve explained their 
positions, and you know, we don™t Œ 

Q: How do your children look at this? 

A: Well, the first thing the y said when I told them that I had reconnect ed, and I told 

Œ and the y Œ they sort of said, well ho-
how many 
Œ I mean, I Œ over the years, the y 

kn Œ they knew something. But my youngest daughter, who is herself now, I think 

45 or so. So when this happened, 30 some odd years ago, and I tol d Œ and she said, 
well, how many are there? And I Œ I Œ I tol d her how many cousins there were, and 
she said, you mean, I have 23 instant first cousins? And I said, yeah, 23. 

Q: Wow. Wow.
 

A: Right. So that was Œ it was Œ 
it yi  
Œ 
they each 
Œ they each handl ed it, or Œ i-in Œ 
in their own wa y. 

Q: And tell me Œ I think we™re coming close to the end Œ  

A: 
Mm
-hm.

Q: Œ of our interview. What would you sa y to others? What woul d you sa y to others 
aboutthis destiny that yourfamily hashad? 
I Œ I™ll speak Œ  
A: What would I say? 

Q: To other people. To people like me, who are strangers. To Œ you know, you Œ 
your 
destiny clearly is born from t he circumst ances of World War II. This i mpartial, 
horrible thing, and in particular, the Holocaust . What would you sa y to people about 
this destiny? What would you want them to understand? 

A: I think I would want Œ I can speak both from a specific, and a more global 

perspective. In the larger sense, I would want people to Œ to know, and to 

understand that we™re all a common humanity. That unfortunately, there is some 

evil that exists in the world, but that most  people want what™s best, not only for 

themselves, but for others. I woul d want peopl e to offer, to Œ to Œ to bel Œ to feel and 
to offer compassion for those that are not like them. I have never been able to 
understand why the Holocaust had to happen, but I woul d never blame the next 

generations, that came after the perpetrators of that unspeakable evil and horror, t o 

Œ I Œ I do not blame them. I think the experiences that we all go through in our own 

way, while the Hol ocaust is a very unique story, there are other genocides that 

happen in t his world, and there are millions of other survi vors of those genocides. 

And we try our best to get through life, and that™s all Œ it™s really all we can do,

though be Œ you know, besides tryi ng to get through life and offer compassion to 
others. Offer not only compassion, but acceptance and love and understanding, and 

to not turn awa y from others. I Œ 
I 
Œ I am sorry that I did not find m y German 

family sooner than I di d, but I am thankful and grateful that not only did I find 

them, or reach out to them Œ I always knew where the y were, and t hey al ways knew 
where I was, but that they embraced me, a-and accepted me. And you know, in 
general, I Œ besides that horrible, horrible t i me, that yes, I experienced directly, but I 

was so young that it didn™t affect me the way it affected my older siblings. That  I Œ I 

Œ I™ve had Œ  I™ve been given opportunities and have had a l ife that™s t o be envied. It 

Œ it Œ it has been and continues to be a Œ a wonderful life. I don™t thi nk I can really 

say more than that. 

Q: I think t hat™s a wonderful note, a wonderful note for us to come to Œ to the Œ 
A: But I Œ 
Q: Œ end of our interview. 

A: Yeah. I also think it ™s i mportant that we keep the memories alive. That we never 

forget. And I am profoundly grateful to 
E lie Wiesel
, as being an instrumental figure 

in establishing the Holocaust Museum. Because there are still Holocaust deniers out 

there, throughout t he world. And the Œ one of the problems with denyi ng the 

Holocaust, is that t hat will also mean denying other atroci ties that occur. And we

can™t let that happen. So for the museum t o be a repository of artifacts and 
documents, and bei ng a place where we can learn about hi story, and about the 

unspeakable horrors, and the unbelievable kindnesses of not only those who Œ 
you 
know, the people t hat adopted me, but the people in 
Germany
, who, knowing t hat 
we were Germans tryi ng to hide, did not t urn us in. The y protected us. They found 
food for us, they gave us a place to hide. So Œ so there are good people in the world, 
no matter t heir culture, no matter their teaching, no matter their upbri nging.  

Q: Thank you. Thank you,
