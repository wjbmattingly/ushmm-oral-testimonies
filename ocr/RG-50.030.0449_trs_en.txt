where were you r aise d a nd perha ps a  little bit a b
out your famil y and 
educati on be fore yo u 
we nt t o colle ge. 
A: We ll, I  wa s born i n Chi cago, Illi no
is , in 1914, April 6t h,
 1914, t hat ma ke s me 
82 years of age, as  
the ne ws pa pers have i ndi cated the other day, mu
c h t o my wi fe 's annoya
nce. I was raised in 
Chi cago, more or le ss, a nd I we

high sc hool and high sc hool  
there. 
Q: Tele phone . 

A: Where ar e we now? 

Q: Your  wi fe  was  annoye d t hat t h

A: We ll, you wa nt to start 
off again about Ch icago? 
Q: Sur e .  S ure . 

A:I was born in Chicago in
 1914. My parents both ca
me here fr om Latvia a
nd Russia at the age of 
two a nd t hre e many, ma ny year s a g
o. An d I went to school in 
Chic ago i n publi c s chools:  
gra m mar  sc hool , j uni or 
hi gh sc hool, hi gh sc hool. 
Q: Wh ich part of Chicago? 

A:I wa s bor n on t he We st side of 
Chicago and my fa mily 
gra duall y move d to the Nort h side so t ha t  
by the time I went to college, 
we were living in Wilmette, just
 Nort h o f t he c
ity of Chicago. 
I went to the University of Mi
chi gan, whi ch is a ni ce state school, it had a r egul ar reputation

and wa s  just  a suffi cient dist
ance away from Chicago so I coul d get a way fro
m the fa mi ly a 
little bit, but I coul
d also get back -- by h
itchhiking -- back, 
and get a meal when I neede d  
one . And t h en I we nt on from Unive r sity of 
Mi chigan to the Har var d Law School where I 
got my r egul ar degree , M agna Cum Laude, a nd t h
en I sta yed on for a n addi tional year a nd 
got an L.L.M. at the 
s uggesti on of Felix Frankfurter( ph) . 
I thereafter went down to the 
Circuit Court of Appeals in New 
Yor k City a nd c l erke d for t h e 
pe rson I  c onsi der  to be  on e  
of the better judges, one 
of the best  j udges , re a
lly, in the Unit
ed State s, Augustus N. Ha nd, 
not Lear ne d Ha nd who was hi s co
usi n  who wa s on the s a me c o ur
t, but Gus Ha nd. I st ayed 
wit h hi m for  a ye ar a nd t hen 
ca me  down to Was hi ngt on. In 
Washi ngt on, the the sis wa s  -- 
my thesis was -- that I was going to get a 
job, which I did get with the Securities and  
Exc ha nge  Commissi on i n t he Re or ganizati on 
Di vision. The  reason for  the Reor ga niz ation 
Division being that it was th
e factor in the SE
C which handled litiga
ted cases, corporate 
reorgani zation cas es, and I wa nted t o  go back
 t o Chi cago and prac
tice law with my two 
older  br othe rs in the fiel d of c orpora te re
orga niz ation, whic h ha d bee n occupyi ng a great  
deal of t heir ti me . I ne ver  got ba ck t o Chi cago 
because I left the SEC [p
hone rings] should I 
stop?  
Q: Bac k  t o  C h
icago . . . 

A: Well, I never got back to Chic
ago because I moved fr om
 the SEC t o one of the war ti me agencies, 
the office of Price Administratio
n here which seemed 
a little more exciting at
 the time as we  
were just beginning to get into
 the war. And then fr om the of
fic e of Price  Admini strat i on, 
mo re by  chance than a
nything el se , I  move d over to t he St
a t e De part me nt  i n M arch of 1943.  
Q: Be fore  we  go  t o t he Sta t e De
partme nt, could I ask you about 
your, is your  fa mil y J e wi sh?  
A:M y fa mil y is Je wish. I was rais ed in the Re fo
r m as pect of  the Jewish religi on. I took Hebr e w  
lessons whic h, unfortuna tely, I '
ve completely forgotten abou
t , and, I ' m a reasona bly non-
confor mi ng Je w.

Q: And during the earl y days of Nati onal Sociali s
m, you were in college 
a nd la w sc hool. Wer e  you 
activel y aware of what  was happening, and was 
it something th
at was a major part  of your 
view of the world at that time? 
A: We ll, I wasn™t tremendou sly awar
e of what  was goi ng on. I was ... 
I  re ad t he ne ws papers all t h e  
time  and so I knew approxi mately what wa s goi
ng on, as mu ch as on
e can gain from the 
newspapers. I still rememb
er being in college wh
en Mr. Hitler came to
 power in Germany,  
and I remember talking about that with a hi
stor y profes sor who c urious l y, whose na me I  
curiously enough still re
member, Mr. Slo
ssun(ph), his name was. 
A very distinguished 
professor, a very interesting pr
ofessor. He said, "Hitler will la
st a fe w months, that™s all." 
That was in 1933, when I was 
still in college, and I was awar
e of what was going on quite 
clearl y. When I went t o t he Ha
rvard La w School whi c h wa s i n
 1935, I sa w a l ot of pe ople  
there and, as a matter of 
fact, I 've, a gr oup of ot her people 
and I got t ogethe r  and or gani ze d -
- wit h a fell ow na me d Nat ha n 
Isaa cs(ph), who is a pr ofes sor 
at the busi ness school --  he  
came over to my little ap
artment that I was shar
ing with a couple of 
other characters, and 
sort of gave  us less ons in 
the Tal m ud, suppose dly e very Satu
rday. It lasted a bout three  
Sat urda ys a nd tha t  wa s  about it . But, s o far a s what was  going on i n Ger many wa s  
concerned, yes I was aware of it 
but  I wa sn™t de eply i nvolve d in a nyt hing parti cul ar. I do  
remember being at a Harvar d 
La w Re view dinner one time  a
nd talking with
 one of the 
professors who was resentful ab
out the fact t hat l o ngshor emen 
in Ne w Yor k  had bee n tr ying 
to pre vent the unloadi ng of goods fr om Ger ma n
y, and he thought thi s wa s an unwarrante d  

inter fer ence by a privat e organizati o n in the a
ffairs of t he Uni t ed Stat e s Gover n me nt. I 
disa gree d ra t her strongl y wit h hi
m at the time but didn't take a 
tre mendous a mount of a ct, I  
did not take an active role, real
ly, in anything going on. I ha
d a little bit to do, not very 
much, with r efugee matte rs. Partiall y beca use one
 of the peopl e who event ually beca me my 
partner, and who wa s a y
ear or  t wo a f ter me i n la w school
, was very muc h invol ve d i n that.  
And I probably contributed a little bit to some 
organizations but I didn™t do very much more  
than that.

Q: You ment ione d that it  was sort of by cha nce t h
at you went to the Stat e De part me nt. Can you  
descr i be  a  lit tle bi t mo
re about t hat  chance?  
A: Ye s, I ca n. As I  sai d,  I 've  sp ent a  large a mo u nt 
of time in the Reorgani
zation Division of the 
Securities and Exchange Commi
ssion when I first ca
me down here to
 Wa shington. And 
eventually in 1943, in early '4
3, a friend of mine, Bernard Me
lser(ph), who's still a Professor  
of Law, Emeritus, at the Uni ver
sity of Chicago, called me. He
 was temporarily in the State  
De part me nt . He was a  ve r y bri ght  young ma n an
d he wa s a bout  to go ov
er t o Europe , I t hink 
he was i n o n  the Nure mb erg T r ia
ls, but he was in the State De
part me nt at t he ti me . And he  
called me , a nd he sa id t here was a very intere
st ing thi ng going on there ,  and why di dn't I 
come over to the Stat e  De part me nt and 
organize or work on s o met h ing c alled t he  
Re organiz ati on Progra m in the Forei g n Funds Co
ntrol Division of the De
partme nt of State. 
And I sai d, "Ber nie , that  has absol ut ely noth
i ng t o do wit h corpora t e reor gani zation under  
Ch apter 10 of the Bank," -- we
ll , Chapte r 10 didn't e xist, but 77B di d -- "under  the  
Ba nkr upt cy Act at all . It 's a bs olut ely di ffer
ent ." And he s aid, " We
ll, you know that  a nd I  
know that, but nobody else knows that and 
you're the only pers
on around who knows  
somet hing a bout quot e, 
'r eorganization.'  Reor
ga ni zation is r eor gani zation i s  reor gani zati on."  
So,  I thought it was a very inte
re sting kind of thi ng, and we nt
 over to the St ate Depart ment,  
and ba sicall y I was  the  fello w wh
o was in charge  of the pr ogr
am, which t h ere was one, and 
trying to run the Germans out of
 enterprises, primarily in La
tin America. Th
e re organi z ation 
progra m the r e wa s one whi ch to
ok into account  the fact that
 a large number of business  
enterprises in Latin America, in particular
, had bee n founded by Ger ma n e nter pr i ses ,  
Far ben

 and a variet y of other s. And the worr y was that the se  enterpri ses would c ontr i bute  
to the Nazi war effort in at 
least two wa ys . One wa s by contr i but
i ng of funds to a vari ety of 
very e vil ca uses; a nd the other wa s by contri but
i ng and financ i ng es piona g e, or sa botage, or

worse . And the i dea wa s , you ha
d to allow t he Latin Ameri c ans t o c onti nue t o have  the  
bene fits of these or ganizati ons, ma ny of
 whi ch were  in the medical a nd drug , 
phar maceuti cal field. You couldn™t
 just clos e down the orga niz ations, s o you ha d to c ont inue  
to ha ve the organi zati ons do wha t  the y  had be
en doing: produci ng dr
ugs. But you wa nte d  to 
get the German influen
ce out of those, and th
a t  was the  re orga niza tion as pect:  tryi ng t o  
introduce, primarily at that 
ti me, Ameri can ent erprise to 
come in and take over these  
enter prise s. Cert ainl y during t he peri od of th
e war, a nd probably t her ea ft er, beca use we  
always had the the or y that we di dn™t wa nt
 the Ger mans t o  come back again i n Lat i n  

Ameri ca, par ticularl y i n view 
of the fa ct that the National So
cialist philosop
hy wa s one t ha t  
wa s a nat he ma to most of us here .  
Q: Wa s t hat  r e organiz a tion s e par a te  fr om t he Sa
fe Ha ven Program?  Or  
was  that part  of it ? 
A: The  Sa fe Ha ven Progr a m de vel ope d 
out of t he Re organiz ati on t hing, 
that's right. I was one of the 
origi nat ors of t his , s o call ed, Sa fe Haven Progra
m. But  that ha d the sa me ki nd of obj ective at  
it that t he Re orga niza tion Progra m di d. Re organi
z ation was suppose d to:  
a)  take care of the 
present threat Œ try to get the German control 
away from these enterpri
ses in Lati n Amer i can 
so they c oul dn™t c ont ribute money; a n d sec ondly
, t he idea was to preven
t any recurrence o f 
the German influence in Lati
n America. That, basic ally, wa
s the Sa fe Ha ven Pr ogra m, 
preventi on of rec urre nce  of Na zi
s m, a nd fasc is m, a nd so forth. 
Q:But Safe Haven was an internatio
nal e f fort , not  just a n Ame r ican e ffort , is that , ca n you descr i be  
more about  Sa fe  Ha ven and its  be gi nnings?  
A: We ll, Sa fe  Hav e n wa s basic a lly , 
my recollection is, it was basicall
y an Ameri can in
itiative but we 
certainly had the British involved in it fr om
 the very beginning. 
And it ma y have been 
international in the broader sens
e of t he word, bec ause  I™ m sur e, 
as what  resulted, as a f act  
of the later days, the French 
got involved very h
eavil y. But basic ally, at the begi nni ng, t he 
British and the A mericans were the only ones
 who we re abl e  to do a nyt hi ng a nd it wa s a 
Briti sh-American effort , basically
 ai med at tr ying to
 identi fy Ger man i n fluence whi c h one 
coul d equate  with Nazi i n flue n
ce at t he ti me, a nd to try to ge t rid of that, not onl y at the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
6 
 
prese nt ti me , but for, t o prevent a ny recurr en
c e of it . That was ba sicall y the Sa fe Ha ven 
Program. What we were trying
 to do is locate areas where 
t he Ger mans had located mo ney, 
where  Ger m ans  were  cloaking or ha vi ng some bo
dy else cloak for them
 etcetera, etcetera. 
Q: An d,   sp ec ifi ca
lly, what  di d you, 
what was  your  r ole i n t hat  e ffort?  
A: We ll, I was tryi ng to devi se po
licies with respect, particularly 
in the beginning, with the Latin  
Americans to try to persuade the Latin A mer
icans, for example, t o control the Ger ma n  
enter prise s, Ger ma n owned ent erpri ses i n thei
r territory. But, my fi
rst trip was down to  

Columb ia and my effort do wn  there wa s to tr
y t o pe rsuade  t he Col u
mbia n gove rnme nt to 
either supervise or actually ve
st t he asset s bel onging to Ger ma n controll ed ent erpri se s and 
then to have those administer
ed in accordance with this re
organization progr
a m by Allies, 
by A mericans, pr obabl y , because t h e Ameri cans 
were the only ones really able to do this 
kind of thing but we would have said the Britis
h or the Dutch or anybod
y else, if there were 
people like that around 
a s well . But t here  were n™t very ma ny a round. 
Q:So it was actually an effort to 
tr y and move Ameri c a n ma nage ment
 in to take control of  the 
corporation, is that...  
A: Ye s.  

Q:...what you were doing? 

A: Yes. Exactly. Because th
e i dea was, you were, as I say, ha
d two obje cti ves . One wa s a war t i me  
obje ctive , t o prevent es pi ona ge 
and sa bota ge and fi nancing of t h
e Ger ma n war  e
ffort and the 
second was a post- war e ffort which was akin with the idea
, part of the idea that you didn't  
want t he Ger man, Ger mans as they
 wer e t hen certainl y, to co
me  back in to any kind of 
political power in other areas of
 the world. We had some probl
ems here in the United States, 
as you probably know, with... we
 also had a lot of problems 
with the possibility of Germans 
infiltrating into the enterprise
s, particularly into
 the enterprises wh
ere they had been 
prominent in countries like Boli
via , Col u mbia, Argenti na , etc etera, in Lati n Americ a. Tha t  
wa s t he part  o f  the  worl d t hat I  was  ver y mu
ch involved with. The 
entir e enterprise had  
some people fr om, for 
example, one of my good friends
, Kovi(ph) Oliver
, who is still

around, a ve ry disti nguis hed, 
now for me r, a mbas sador of th
e United States to Colo mbia 
ma ny year s aft er thi s, was stati one d in Madr
id. A good many of th
e people who were  
involved in this when
 I got into it, were 
Ame r ica n s who spoke  good 
Spani s h because Latin 
Ameri ca was one of t he areas of
 our concentration. We woul
d find a lot of the people 
involve d i n t his we re pe ople who ha d bee n bor
n i n El Pas o, a s Kovi(p
h) wa s, or i n s o me  
place i n Texas who spoke 
Spanish as well as they did Eng
lish, or nearly 
as well. Kovi  
probably spoke it better. 
Q: And t hat  wa s 1943 
when you went to th
e  State  De part me nt ... 
A:1 94 3 wa s wh en  I ca me int o it . 
The e ffort had bee n going on for a w
hil e be fore  tha t . I c a me i nt o 
this Di visi on of Forei gn Funds 
Control, which was basically tryi
ng to look at  the fi nancial 
trans actions of pe opl e who might be  supporti
ng the Axis , a n d what we wer e tryi ng to do 
was to prevent any financial tr
a nsac t i ons whic h woul d ha ve be
en of be ne fit  to the m. There  
wer e a variet y of aspects of that . One was to bl
ac klist compani es, eit her
 in the United States 
or elsewher e, pri marily el sewher e, because we
 ha d direct control ove
r the United States. But 
we wer e tryi ng to blac kli st co
mpanies, mainly fr om the neut
ral countries who were doing 
business with the Germans. 
Q: Ca n you me ntion wha t  some  of
 t hose compani e s are, were? 

A: The y wer e , we we re, we had a bl acklis t whic h 
wa s maint aine d in Swi t zerla nd, Swede n, Spai n,  
Port ugal, Ar genti na , Col u mbia , Turkey, a variet
y of other countries. Basically, wherever we  
thought, what we c oul d do woul
d be  to prevent a fi nancial tr ansa ction which woul d have  
bee n be ne fic i al to the ... t o the Ger ma ns. We  we
re active in trying to sa
y-- to the enterprises,  
mai nly, or t o indi vidual s, but mainl y thes e would be ent er prise s, indi vidual s acti ng as  

enter prise s, a s wel l -- we wer e tryi ng t o say t o 
the m, "I f you do this , you're  not going to have  

any access, whatsoever, to an
y A merican facilities. And we 
will not only prevent you now 
fr om dealing with 
the United States, selling to
 the United States or 
getting exports from the  
Uni t ed  S t ate s, but  we wi ll co n
tinue this effort after the wa
r  i n order  to preve nt you fro m 
rebuilding the thing."

Q: Could you menti on s o me
 of t he enterprises that we™re d
eali ng wit h, s o me of the Ger ma n  
enter prise s?  
A: We ll, t he ,  Sterli ng  Dr ug wa s o n
e of the enter prises; I G Farben
2
, of c o urse , is t he l arges t one. 
There were a whole slew of 
cor por ations in Swede n whic h had bee n manufacturing ball 
beari ngs for  other ma chine parts a n d thi ngs li
ke  that, who wer e all on the bl ackl ist. M y  
recoll ection doe s not go t o the indivi dual na me
s ve ry muc h. We  had a fe w Ameri c a ns on the  
blacklist, some American na
tionals living in Vichy France
... France were suspect ed of  
dealing with the Germans, and 
we blacklisted American nationa
l s. That r aised some i ssues 
here but we  did it nonet heles s. But , one of t h
e real reasons for the negot iations wit h the 
Swiss in 1946 was the 
fact that t he bl acklist 
still existed and there 
were a number of Swiss 
corporations which were still on 
the blacklist and they were o
bviously desirous of getting 
the m off the blac klist . We were desir ous of r e
stor ing nor ma l r elations , 
too. But the principal 
motive for the negotiations on the Swiss side , was to eliminat e the blac klist. 
Q:I want  to l ay a s much 
groundwork f or t he Swiss  negotiati ons as 
possible. So we'r e 
now at '43, '44. 
You ha ve come to t he St ate De part ment and y
ou're sort of gr adually be comi ng pa rt of the  
Sa fe  Ha ven Program,
 is this right? 
A: Ye s, exce pt not  gra dua lly. 
Q: Not  gradually. It  di dn™t  ha ppen gra d ually. 

A: No, it di dn™t ha ppe n gradually. I wa s there i n  th
e be ginni ng and was very a ctive in it. Largel y 
beca use I ca me t o the St ate De part ment in 1943 as a ver y he althy young ma n with ve ry,  

very ba d eye s. And t hough I tri ed to get int o 
t he Navy, t hey thr e w me
 out , l aughing al l t h e  
time . And then the Army  called me down for the draft 
twice and they examined me fr om 
stem to stern and fo und I was 
a very, very healthy 
specimen until they got 
to my eyes. Then  
they coul dn™ t beli eve  how ba d t hey wer e a nd I

d anti- Se miti s m bac klas h, beca use  of s enior 
State Department positions ear
lier. Can you sort of explai
n what that sc
ene was like? 
A:I speculated with Mr. 
Bower(ph) a little bit about this, I™ve ne
ver been quite sure about it, but I 
did move  up. I f you take a lo
ok at my recor d in the Stat
e De pa rt me nt , I moved up from the  
entry level to high in 
t he Civil Ser vice s, I  could go very, 
ver y quickl y. And t here al wa ys wa s  
a rumor around t hat t he  State De
par t me nt was r ather a nti- Se miti c. I al ways t hought tha t  
there were some people in th
e ol d Foreign Ser vi ce who were
, alt hough I had ma ny, ma ny  
friends in the Foreign Se rvice who ha d no an
ti- Se miti s m what soe ver, a nd I  de vel ope d t hese  
fri endshi ps a s ti me we nt along. 
But it seemed to me, at the ve
ry beginning, that perhaps one 
reason t hat I  was pr omot ed as quickl y as I 
was, wa s be cause  I was 
what you might call a 
respe cta ble J ew. I 'd bee n to the Har va r d La
w Sc hool, I ™ d bee n on t he Harva r d La w Re vi ew, 
I 'd been a cl erk for a ver y disti nguished WA SP

, a judge up in Ne w York Cit y, etc eter a, 
etceter a. I knew which fork t o
 pic k up at t he di nner  ta ble, 
etcetera. And I was reasonabl y  
respectable. And it seemed to me that there wa
s some possi bil ity that
 when people looked 
around the y said, well , here™s a fell ow, we r
eally wa nt t o do somet hin

progra m, her e™s a guy who happens t o know 
a lot about it and who is very competent and

who is res pe ctable a nd, you know, he 's the ki
nd of pers on we woul d like to pus h for wa r d. So 
I did get to be the Chi e f of t he 
Divi sion in a very, very s hort 
per i od of t i me a nd, a fter t hat  the  
De put y Dire ctor of the offi ce, 
and after that the fi rst Assist
ant Legal Advisor for Economic  
Affai r s, etcet era, et ceter a. Whet her t hi s had much
 t o do with my bei ng Je wi sh or not Je wis h,  
I really don't know exce
pt that I had a... I al
ways had a sort of a little
 bit of a feeling that 
well , ma ybe, everybody t hought well , this
 is a, quote, go
od Je w, unquote .  
Q:But the anti-Semiti
sm, as you said, wa s not an
 issue fo r you. You didn™t 
experience i t  directly in 
the Stat e Depart ment. 
A: No, I ne ver experie nc ed it direct
ly in the State Depart
me nt. Th e only experi
ence I  ever had with  
really di sc us sing it in a ny, eve n re mot e wa y, was i n connect ion with Mr . Bower™ s book, The  
Papercli p Cons pira cy, indicate d 
that I was one of th
e pe ople i n the St
at e De part me nt who 
wa s most in fa vor  of purs uing
 wha t  ha d be en Mr. Roose velt '
s polic y of kee ping well- known, 
very a ctive Naz i s out of the Unite d States, bot h 
then and proba bly for ever . And ther e was a  
progra m whi c h was near and dear
 t o t he hearts of t he Unit ed
 St ates Ar my peopl e which was 
to bring German scientists, partic
ularly rocket scientists, to th
e United States to help us in 
our r ocket pr ogra m. The Ger ma ns obviously ha d 
been well-advanced i n the rocket program,  
way ahead of al most an
ybody els e. And it was n
™t Wa rner Von Brown(ph) and people l i ke  
that, but t he y wante d t o bring a 
lot more people in. That raised
 the question as
 to how many  
of these people you s
hould bring into the Un
it ed St ates, contrar y 
to what had been the 
publicly st at ed poli cy, as I recall, of Presi d
ent Roos evelt , tha t , well , no Naz i s, or a c tive  
Naz i s, we re not goi ng to get int o the Uni t ed 
States. I was a little more
, a l ot more per h aps ,  
aggressive in the sayin
g, we ought to have very, very stri
ct standards of necessity and utility,  
bringing thes e people int o  the United State s tha n
 the Ar my rea lly wa nte d to adopt . As fa r as  
I coul d tell, bac k in thos e days, the Ar my of
fic e r s, in Ger ma ny pa rticular ly, would go out  

and they wo uld find some body who'd swept th
e floor  in the rocket  
establishment. They 
wa nte d to br ing hi m t o t he Unit ed St ates on t h
e grounds t hat  he woul d c ontri but e to the...  

our own effort to deve
lop rocket techno
logy. I had a little
 discussion about that, I wrote a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449

me mora ndum about it , as a matter 
of fact , one time , and I got in
to a dispute, whi ch is  in... 
account ed i n  Mr. Bower 's book, 
with a ver y good fri end of 
mi ne named Cl are Wilcox( ph) , 
for whom I work
ed, as a matter of fa ct, 
a little bit later, in trad
e matters. He was a very 
disti nguishe d economi st fr om Sw
arthmore a nd I ' m s ure he had 
not the slightest bit of anti-
Semitism in him, not th
e slightest. But he thought that 
I was being a little 
too sensitive about 
the possibility that if you brou
ght some of these Nazis into 
the United States they would 
contri bute t o  what  was  
then, to a certain extent, the latent 
anti-Semitism of ce
rtain people in 
the Unite d States. I 'd li ve d in Ne w York when 
I was clerk for 
Gus Ha nd, and bac k in t hos e 
days, t her e wa s a guy na me d Fritz  Coon(p
h) who wa s ar ound, 
who wa s a well- know n  
Ameri can Nazi. I n any c ase, Wilcox and I got i n
t o a dispute whi ch was 
r efl ected in a couple 
of me mos ba ck and fort h in whic
h Cl a r e(ph) bas i ca lly sai d he was just a s ant i -Na zi as I was  
but  he  di dn™t  thi nk that  this wa
s the... it was appropriate, we 
were tr ying t o  kee p t oo many  
people out of the United Stat
es who would be usef
ul, etcetera. And I ha
d a little discussion 
by me mo randum with him. Th e f
act t hat it never r eally beca
me pers onal was evi denced by 
the fact that sometime a little 
bit later, Clare Wilcox(ph) was 
the Deputy Chairman of our 
dele gation t o  the I nter nati onal Tr ade Or gani zati on
 in 1947-48, and I was t h e legal a dvis or to  
that dele gati on. I wa s one of Cl
are's( ph) pri ncipal  assi stants i f you can cal l it that, at t hat  
ti me . And he a nd I be ca me ver y, very good 
friends. So I don't th
ink that, well, that 
disc ussi on t o ok pla ce lar gely, I think, because 
I had sai d that t here were too ma ny of these  
Naz i s, or  pe ople  who we re likely 
to be Nazis, who we
re getti ng int o t he Uni t ed Stat es unde r  
color of necessity and I 
really wanted to have a very strict
 standard applied.

e m, and you could get 
ever ythi ng you nee de d out of th
e m i n a peri od of about  six mo

bee n ver y good at one point , you ca n proba bly 
e xpe ct to get more thi ngs out of hi m a s he  
went along, in the future. But,
 my recollection is 
that that was the re
ason for Mr. Bower's 
book, The  Papercl ip Conspira cy, basi cally. 
Q: Right . The Unit ed Stat es took what 's, I underst a
nd, has been descr i be d as 
a very tough roll agai nst  
the neutral countries. Can you 
describe the attitude,
 maybe even the posi
tion, of the State 
De part me nt goi ng int o the Swiss negotiati ons i n 
1946. And I guess I nee d you t o sor t  of la y 
the groundwork with the Paris 
Ag reements the ye ar before. 
A: We ll, I 'll  go ba ck e ven be
fore the Pari s Agreement . The 
Pott sda m (ph)  Agre e me nt, si gne d, 
basically, the assets in the neut
ral countries of German nationa
ls, to the Western Allies with 
respe ct to re parati on pur pos es. So t h at the theo
r y  was t hat we woul d take, the ... we 'd get  
reparations from the Germans, 
and not only from Ge rmany it
sel f, the  oc c upie d ar eas , but  
also from t h e areas where Ger m
ans had interests in the neut
ral countries. And the Paris 
Agree me nt deci ded on how those asset s, how 
all of the reparations to be taken fr om 
Ger ma n y, woul d be di vi ded up a mong all of 
the  West ern Al lies. Beca us e the onl y peopl e 
prese nt , the  onl y countri es pr ese nt at the Pott sd
a m  Agreement , wer e the Uni t ed State s, Great  
Britain, and the Soviet Union. 
So, Par i s ha d t o do somet hing 
a bout all ocati ng t he proce eds , 

allocating the amounts that w
ould be given to the various 
Allied countries, whether they  
happe ned t o be Belgium,  Hol l
and, or the Unit ed States, and 
so forth. The Paris Agreement 
also wor ked out a for mul a -- b
ecause even then we were conc
erned about refugees and the 
people who were le
ft  homel ess, t he persecut
ee s a nd so fort h --  ha d 
wor ked out an agr eement  
that a portion of wh at wa
s re covered woul d be a lloc at ed t o wha t  wa s t hen the 

Intergovernmental Committee fo
r Refugees, and through t he 
Intergovernmen
tal Committee 
for Refugees primarily it 
was decided -- I'm not sure if this 
was in Paris or a little bit later --

 [phone ringing]  The machine 
will pick that up, I hope. In any case, the 
Paris Agreement was one
 in which we were 
allocat ing the pr oceeds of t h
e r eparat i ons  whic h wer e sc he duled t o c o me  fr om Ger m any. 
Now, par t  of those proce eds , obvious l y, were t h
e assets of German, of
 the German entities, 
and Ger ma n  indi vidual s locate d i n the ne utral 
countrie s. And that l aid t he  bac kgr ound for  
the negotiations with th
e Swiss and then late
r  with t he Swedes an
d t he Spa nis h a nd the  
Port uguese and, even t o  a certai n li mited ex
tent , wit h the Turks. Because we knew t here 
were a lot of German assets located in Swit
zerl and; Switzer la nd ha d bee n right  there at  the  
center of Europe , it wa s a financ ial c enter and 
so forth. And t here was no que stion but  that  
there were a lot of Ge
rman assets in Switzerland. So we
 be gan the se ne gotiat i ons on the 
thesi s that what we were aft er, i n accor d
ance with the Paris Repa
ration Agreements, the 
United States, Great Britain and 
France, as agents of all the 
other Allies, were to secure  
these assets whi ch were located
 i n the ne utral c o untrie s a nd put t he m i nt o the reparat i ons  
pot , whic h would be admi nister ed e vent uall y 
by the Interallied Repa
rati o ns Ag enc y, whi c h  
had be en est ablis hed a nd whic h wa s functi oni ng
 in Brussels. So, we 
bega n t he negotia tions  
with the Swiss, basically, on that thesis: Th
at what we we re doi ng wa s to look for the  
German assets in Switzerland an
d put  the m i n the  repar ations pot . On t he Swiss side, t h e  
negotiati ons, as I sa id a mo ment  ago, were us
e ful, i f you wa nt to 
put it t hat wa y, bec a use  
what they were ai ming for was to get rid 
of t he freezing a nd the bl oc king whi ch wa s the  
result of t he procl ai me d l i st of c ertai n bloc ke
d na t i onal s, t he for mal na
me for the blacklist. 
So that we had so me incentive on both sides 
to go ahead and negotia
te. On the Allied side, 
wh en we sta r ted th e ne
gotiations, before we ac
tually got into the ne
gotiations, we be ga n to

think about  this, and i f we were  thinki ng 
a bout taki ng over the Ger ma n as s ets in 
Switzerland, we began to worry 
about what are, quote, the "G
er man a sset s  in
 Switzerland." 
And at t hat  poi nt, maybe be fore , it wa s c ertai nl y 
on all of our mi nds, 
but articulating it, we 
began t o say the  for mula , " The  e ne mies...or 
our  e ne mies ... are  our  frie nds." And we wer e  
not goi ng t o take over  the  asset s, e ve n though 
the y had originat e d from some body i n Berl in, 
if they belonged to a 
per secut ee. That is, t he assets of 
Mr. Ha ns Sc hmidt , a good Ger ma n 
Nazi, which were located in 
Switzerland, were different fro
m the assets of Mr. Chai m 
Cohe n, who had di ed in Ber ge n- B
els en or i n Aus chwitz  or  in 
someplace li ke t hat . Equally a 
citizen, for m erly a citiz e n of Berlin who ha d 
de posite d ass ets  in Switzerl a nd. So, whe n we  
began t he ne gotiat i ons, we ha d ba sical ly the se,
 the overall objective of
 sec uri ng t he Ger m a n  
assets in Switzerland, and the subsidiary, bu
t not ve ry subsidi ary, 
de viation from that  
obje ctive , of exe mpti ng and ma king sure that 
the persecutees got whatever they possibly 
coul d get  out  of that . 
Q: How di d you go a bout deter mi n
ing what t hose fi gure s wer e?  
A:We ll, in the fi rst place, we didn't determine wh
at the fi gure s were . The fir st thing we did, was t o  
say i n effect , "I f there's a Ge
r man asset, so-called Ger man 
a ssets i n Swit zerland, and you 
identi fy it , a nd M r . Cohe n who us ed t o be livi
ng i n Berlin, c o me s over t he r e and sa ys , 'He y ,  
I was a persecutee, I sur v
ived Bergen-Belse n,  he re
 I am, I want my prop
erty back,' you, the  
Swiss, nobody else, takes that asset and puts it 
into the reparation pot." -- Just as we, in the 
Uni t ed States, were retur ning the assets of pe
r sec utees who c oul d turn up here and i d enti fy 
the a sset s. Even though t hey we
re , quote, in quote s, " Ge r man a
ssets." We  demanded that the  
Swiss do exactly the sa
me. And as far  as I k
now, there was never any 
objection to that on 
the part of the Swiss. 
And as far as I know, 
every German Je w who tu
rned up in Switzerland 
and c oul d i d enti fy his ass e
ts, got those assets back. 
Q: Wa s t hat  a  signi fic ant  number , do you ha ve  
any idea how significan
t t hat  number was? 
A:I have no idea how ma ny a sset s  there were , but
 I assume t here were a numb er of people, 
partic ularl y perhaps , mo re from Ger ma ny t ha n
 from the  ot he r occ upie d a r eas. Beca us e the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
15 
 
Ger mans, i n effect , had more noti ce. I mean, H
itler was there in 1932
, '33, and it wa s a long 
time before the controls really
 fell into place, be
fore the Fi na l Sol ution was be gun to be  
worke d on a nd so fort h.
 And the German Je ws were likely 
to be more pr osper ous than the  
Hungarian or the Ru manian Jews
,  although there were a lot 
of prosperous 
Ru ma nia n  and  
Hungaria n J ews, maybe  eve n Bul gari ans , a nd Po
li sh. So, t he Ger man Je ws had s o me notic e  
and, despite the fact that ther
e were c ontr ols whic h wer e  ena c t e d by t he Ger mans, I 'm sur e  
there was a considerabl e  peri od 
of time when those controls 
coul d be successfully evaded. 
So, I suspect, a large number of Ger man 
Je ws a ctuall y  did get t h eir mone y out of  

Switzerl and [si c ]. One way or a not he r. Ma
ybe be fore the war  actuall y br oke out , ma ybe  
eve n dur ing the war. The  a mounts , I have not th
e slightest idea. Reall y. 
I don't think we ever  
tried to make any evaluation of
 how many German Jewish assets there were in Switzerland, 
say, in 1932, at the begi nningof t he war before t hings really
 began t o get  terrible . And so, 
we  ha d no wa y of knowing ho
w much would have bee n r ec
over ed by Ger man Je ws  who 
ca me out. Whether the Swis s woul d have fi gur
es  on some body who tur ne d up at the bank, 
and was able to identify
 the bank number, and wa
s  able t o sa y, "I a m the sur vivor," or, "I  a m 
actuall y the guy who put  the mo ne
y there and I want to get it 
bac k now." An
d how ma ny of  
thos e pe opl e  actuall y tur ned up a nd got t heir mo
ney out , tha t  I just 
do not know. I don't 
know whet her anybody knows it. 
M aybe some peopl e do, ma ybe 
i f you went ba ck a nd di d 
this kind of s t udy t hat Mr . Vol cke r is  doi ng
, ma ybe you could go bac k
 t hr o ugh all  those  old 
recor ds  and you c oul d fi nd that  
people did actually turn up and 
did recover thei r asset s . I'm 
sure that a large number 
of the m di d. That i s not t o say th
at a large number  of the m di d not . 
But  a  lar ge number  of t he m di d. 
As I  say, I suspect in t he cas
e of the Germa n Jews, it would 

have bee n more like l y that they got t he money 
out than the case of the Hungarians and the 
other s who t hought that , " Well, it 's not goi ng to c o me her e," t he Czec hs or what eve r , who 

thought, " We are going t o be prot ect ed."  I  know
 there was a l ot of peop
le in, say, Austria, 
who had mo ney i n Swit z erland, a
nd who ca me  out and the n we nt 
back i n to Austri a, because 
they thought  that  nothi ng was goi ng t o happen to
 them. But, in most of those cases, they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
16 
 
their fa mili e s out be fore t hey we nt ba ck. We
 know a number of peopl
e would ba ck a nd then,  
of c our se , t h ey got  ca ught. 
Q: We 're  tal k ing about i n divi dual s 
now. We 're goi ng i nto the  negoti ations
, wh at about ot
her assets in 
Swiss banks, especially 
the question of gold. 
A: We ll, t he que stion of gol d, there 
a r e two di ffe r ent questi ons there . I f I can go ba ck, the ot her  
asset s you wante d to tal k about,
 let me talk about th
e ot her as se ts. There we
re a lot of assets 
deposite d in Switzerl and by Ger ma n, Hungaria n,
 etcetera, Jews, ever yb
ody wa s putti ng t heir  
mone y in, whether it wa s Je wish or not . But the 
Je ws ha d a partic ular re ason and a lot of 
thos e as sets wer e  ne ver c l ai me
d. Bec ause the pe ople di ed i n c onc entra tion ca mps, not onl y 
they died, but all of their heirs and so forth 
died. Now, on those as sets , t hos e I take i t  are  
what we are talking about here
, s o far as these negoti ations 
are concer ned. There probably 
are still a substantial number of those around
. Because the Swiss never did what I and a 
variet y of ot her pe opl e urged t he m to do at the en
d of the war, do the kind
 of census
 that Mr. 
Vol cker and his group a r e doi ng at t he pre sent ti
me . It 's very diffi cult , I think, to get any  

clear fi gur es  down to t he  last penny or Swi
ss fr anc or  what ever, as
 to how ma ny of these 
asset s ther e wer e, a nd maybe you could never r e
ally identify all of 
them. But , because we 
disc ove red here in the Un
ited States when we tried to do 
a similar thing, 
it was ver y, very  
difficult to identify heirless as
s ets. J ust by na me s and t hi ngs
 like that. But,
 to a cert ai n 
extent, a lot of those assets di
d e xist i n Ger many, and t hey co
uld ha ve had a cens us . Per haps  
not as elaborate as the one whi ch i s bein
g conduct ed now because it would have  been 
time lier then. Now, 
Mr. Volcker has to go ba
ck over all  these years 
and c h eck bac k re c ords .  
And banks have disa ppe a r ed, and ac c ounts have
 been tr ansferr ed, etcet era, etceter a. Then, 
that was not the case; they c
oul d ha ve done a c ens us a nd, 
while I don't think they would 
have been able to identify ev
er y heirl ess asset, particularl y si nce names ar e ambiguous, as 
we discover ed here i n the Un
ite d St a t es. The na me Burger mi
ght be Warren Burger (ph) of 
the Supre me  Court , it mi ght be 
my fri end, Ra ul(ph) Burger, wh
o is Je wis h. And t his Wa rre n 
Burger is not Jewish. Burger is
 a good Ger ma n na me , 
it just means an inha
bitant of the city.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449

But , i n a ny c ase, we woul d no
t have gotten down to the last 
pe nny, but t he y  could have done  
something at that time . Now, I think that they
 are goi ng ba ck, and to a cert ain exte nt , I thin k 
Mr. Volc ker  and hi s gr oup, and 
maybe even the Swiss group wh
i c h is doi ng s o me di ff erent  
kind of survey, will be able to
 locate some of these, the a
ssets. So, what we were talking 
about in the negotiations, also we
re these heirless assets and we 
were trying to 
insist , we di d 
insist , t hat t he heirless asse
ts be put in the hands of so
me body. Questi on: Who is  that  
some body?  We ll, i f a Ge r ma n Je w 
ca me out a nd he identi fie d th
e as set as being his own, he  
got it back. That we settled from
 t he  very begi nning. I f he were not alive  and neithe r  wa s  
anybody els e who sur vi ved hi
m, the questi on i s: What ha pp
ens to t hose Ger man Jewi sh 
asset s whi ch are, in a 
true sense, heirless? A
nd t her e, all we c ould ge
t out of the Swiss was a 
statement of sympathet ic cons
i dera tion. The y would gi ve  
considerati on, sympat hetic  
consideration, to the desirabilit
y of identifying those assets 
and making them 
available to 
one of the re lie f organi za tions . The re lie f orga
ni za tion we had in mi nd at the mome nt , wa s  
the Intergovernmental 
Committee for Refugees
, whi ch wa s succ eeded by the I R O, the  
Inter national  Re fuge e Or gani zatio
n. And both of thos e us ed, a s 
a operati ng agency, the Joint  
Distribution Committee and the Je
wish Agency fo r Palestine, 
I guess it was at the ti me. So, 
that was the situati on wit h respec
t to heirless assets an
d t he ne gotiat i ons, a s I sa y, ca me  to a  
conclusi on, not a ver y s atis fact or y concl usi on 
on that basis, with 
the Swiss saying they 
would give sympathe tic consid

commit me nt  on their si de. I thi nk t he y regr et
 now not havi ng give n us a fi r m c o mmit me nt, 
and I regret it very muc h, an
d pe opl e who might  have be ne fi

regret it , I s u ppose , most of all. So tha t  was t h
e situation with respect 
to the heirless assets. 
And we 've been ne goti ati ng, fi ghti n

al most ever si nce . In my

 and I worke d on t heir be hal f a  
very, ver y... a lot of hours, 
anywa y. And did a lot of thi ngs in c onnecti on 
wi th Jewish cl ai ms. And one of the t hi ngs I 
did was to conti nue to purs ue thi s busi nes s of
 the heirl ess asset s in
 Switzerland, so that 
someti me , I think, i n 1951, I 
wa s in, actuall y we nt
 to Swit zerl and a nd ha d a meeting wit h 
the American Legation as it s
till was then, the Emba
ssy, and we went over to the Swiss  
For eign Offi ce or t he Mi nistr y of 
Justice, I've forgotten which, 
to talk about th
is issue. And 
had a rather fr ustrating meeting 
over  t hen, ove r i n that offic e. 
I think that was 1951. I would 
have t o ta ke  a look at  the  reco
r d t o ma ke sure . So much for 
hei rless assets 
at that time. 
Q: At the end of those negotiatio

how you felt about the 
conclusion that you 
had rea che d?  Wa s it , di d you fe el a t  the  ti me  th
at it was... given the s

satis fa ctor y, that you'd done wh
at you coul d do?  I mea n, I know 
this is 20/20, we all have 
20/ 20 hi nds i ght . 
A: Fort y yea r s late r. 
Q: No, I me a n, 20/20 hindsight. 

A: Oh, 20/ 20 hindsight , oh. 

Q: Yea h, it 's  40 years la ter, but 
c an you recal l what you were thi

negotiati ons fi nis hed?  
A: Sur e . I re me mber ver y, ve ry well
. I was not very happy with the 
conclusion of the negotiations,  
partic ularl y on thi s ques tion of heirl ess as sets
. We t hought we had a chi eve d prett y much 
wh at we we re able t o
 achieve and what we 
c oul d achi eve i n  connecti on wit h the general  
reclai mi ng of Ger man assets 
for the  reparati ons  pot. Eve n there , there wer e proble ms , 
beca use , bas i cally what  we  di d,
 in the end, was to say to th
e Swiss, "Okay, you're, you will  
identify all the German
 a ssets . Now, I ' m tal king a b out Ge

ones, but, you will identify a
ll the German assets
 in Switzerland an
d you will liquidate, 
under the s uper visi on of s o met hing called t h
e Swiss Compensati on Off i ce, all of t hose 
assets. And then, what you will 
do with the proceeds, 
you will turn 50 pe
rcent of those over 
to the Allies to put into th
e pot of the Interallied Repara
tion Agency, and the other 50 
percent you will retain for yo
ur own claims against German
y." -- Because the Swiss were 
argui ng t hat they had a l ot of clai ms agai nst 
Ger ma ny t he ms elves a nd s o  fort h. And all of 
these Ger man assets i n Switzer
la nd s hould not go to some body
 else, they should go to the 
Swiss clai mants who ha d per f ectl y l egiti mat e 
cl ai ms against  Switzer land [sic]. Now, the 
question of whether it was a 50/5
0 split, whether that was fair 
or not, I never thought that  
that shoul d have be en qui t e that way. I alwa ys 
thought we shoul d have ha
d 60 perce nt , or  70 
perce nt, or ... i f not  100 percent ,
 but that was not rea
lly satisfactory, but 
it seemed to me, and 
I think it se e med to e ve r ybody 
else there, the best we coul
d do with the Swiss . The onl y 
wea pon we  had at t he ti me  was t he c onti nue d e x
i stenc e of the  blac klist . And t hat was a ver y 

fragile weapon at the time. Pe
ople don't reme mber that, but
 nobody re ally want ed to 
conti nue the  blac klist i n the period 1946, '47 
o n, we wer e  n or mali z in
g all of our relations. 
And, in point of fa ct, even in Germany, the 
at titude -- for Germany, I should say -- the 
attitude was changing a great d
eal. You had, at one
 point in '4 3, '44, 
'45, the Morgenthau
7
 
Pla n on t he one si de , which would sa y, well , let '
s reduce Ger many t o an agrarian st ate. And 
then you ha d, after we came in and we  were 
oc c upying Ger ma ny, t he vi ews of peopl e like  
Ge neral Clay and others, wh o 
said, well, the only 
wa y in wh ich this 
economy can survive  
and which c an pre ve nt st arvati on, 
is i f they go bac k to bei ng an
 industrial na tion, whic h t hey 
wer e be fore . And, i n the  end, 
of course, t he Unit ed St ates 
put a tre mendous a mount of 
money into Germany instead of 
taking it out. So, there was a 
certain attitude on their part, 
that we couldn't keep the proclaimed list 
in existence very much
 longer. And I still

 I can't reme mber exactly wh

re worki ng on at the 
ti me , and he  sai d, well, t hat 's proba bl y t he 
best  you can do, why d
on't  you accept  the deal,  
and let it go at that . So, on that si de , we wer e 
rea sonabl y sati s fie d, but not entirel y sati s fie d. 
On t he side of the heirl e ss asset s, I never was ve
ry satisfi ed with it. Bu
t, I coul dn't see what  
else we  were  goi ng to be able t o do be caus e th
e pre ssur e on us t o bri ng these  ne gotiat ions  t o  
an end was very st
rong. The United States, 
I t hink, was stronger on 
this t han anybody else, 
including the British. Th
e British were on our side, but th
ey always had problems about re-
establishing their relations 
wit h Switz erla nd, wit h the Swis s ba nki ng syst e m, a nd th e  
French... 
Q:They were afraid of alienati
ng t he  Swi ss?  What wa s, ca n you..
. I know you were  very much  
involved in discussi
ons with the British. Ca
n you go into more 
detail about that? 
A:The British wanted to re-estab
lish normal relations with
 the Swiss. The Swi
ss had been a neutr al 
country. The British lawyers 
had, perhaps, the same attit
ude that a lot of American 
international lawyers had, except that that see m
ed to me to be a little 
stronger in the Foreign  
Office there than i t  was i n the St ate Depart me
nt he re, ma ybe be caus e I a nd a  couple of ot her  
people like myself were in th
e St ate  De part me nt , but, basi ca
lly, the attitude was that the 
neutr als had a per fec tly good ri ght t o deal with whoever the y were goi ng t o deal with. That ,  

basic ally, is  t he e sse nce of ne utralit y. And t o a 
certain extent, that is 
a policy which had been 
established by the United States
 wa y back i n t he 1800
's when we enacted t he Neutral ity Act .  
We  were able to deal with the French when the Br
itish thought we shouldn 't be dealing with 
the French in the French
-Briti sh wars. But , i n any case, we 
were very strong 
on this subject 
of not dealing with the Germans 
and, basic ally, we  ha
d no par t i cular stre ngt h in r etai ning the  
proclaimed list. So we ca me to 
the conclusion that we might as
 well , the be st thing we c oul d 
do would be  to concl ude  the agree me nts on th
e ba sis we di d, whi c h ga

Whic h ga ve  us a sta t e m ent that the y  would l o
ok sympathet ic ally at t he whole busine s s of 
heirle ss as se ts. And we thought we coul d pr
obably work out some
thing on that and we 
would be able to get them to 
do a c ens us so t ha t  we would 
be a ble  to fi nd out  what  the  
heirle ss a sse ts were , a nd so t hat we  coul d ta
ke those assets and tu
rn them over to the 
Intergovernmental Committ
ee for Refugees. And that 's  wher e 
we were when we ca me to a 
conclusi on. Satis fact ory?  No, t his
 interview which was 
done wi th me
 in the Post, I thought it 
wa s a pr etty good a nd fair stor y, 
a l ot of my fri ends ha ve t o ld
 me th at I  sh
ouldn't be too 
unhappy bec ause I expre s sed a vie w t hat maybe 
we coul d ha ve  done better . We ll, I 've ne ver 
bee n in a ne gotiat i on, a l most never bee n in 
a negotiat ion, where I  th
ought I had done the 
abs olute best  that I pos si bly c oul d at the be
ginning of ne goti at i on. And I a m not now, and  
wa s not t he n, unha ppy wit h what  we ca me  
out with. I thought it
 was a reasonabl y 
satis fa ctor y conclusi on. But , 
not completely satisfactory. 
Q: Let's talk also about  the issu
e  of gold which we  skippe d ove r . 
A:Okay, looted gold, I'll ge
t ba ck to t hat. There, you have t o ma
ke a di sti nction w
ith respect to the 
que stion of l oote d gol d. The  ma
in body of loote d  gol d that we
 were talking about back in 
thos e days when we st a r ted negotiat i ng wit h 
the Swiss and with the 
other s, t he Portuguese  
as wel l , was the go ld whi c h wa
s stol e n by the Ger ma ns out of t he Centra l Bank deposit o ries. 
You have t o know t hat t h e large 
amount of gold that wa s on de
posit in Belgium, in Brussels,  
wa s move d t o Switze r land, and 
maybe down t o Dakar( ph) a nd re-s melte d a nd so forth. But  
that was Bel gian governme nt 
Cent ra l Ba nk gold. And what we wer e the n maki ng s u re of,  
trying to make sure of basically, was that th
e gol d which was  stolen by the Ger ma ns out o f  
ever y Cent ra l Ba nk de positor y, whic h was basi ca
lly wher e gold was kept, wa s restit ute d at  
the end and t hat 's the gol d whic h we have, basi ca l l y, gotte n ba ck. To t he e xtent of about 60 

or 70 or maybe even 80 percent 
of it. That is the go
ld whi ch, basicall y, has bee n distri bute d 
by the Inte r national Gol d Commis si on, a tripa rti
te commis si on on gold, whi ch i s more or 
less affiliated with the in
stitutions in Brussels, 
and which as been rest
ored, a part of which  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
22 
 
has been r es t ored eve n fairly rec entl y, to 
t he Al bani ans , who lost gol d from their ce ntral  
deposit ories and so fort
h. That is one aspect. Th
at 's the major  part of 
the , quote , 
the "looted 
gol d" that went to Ger m any and whi ch was 
use d  by t he Ger ma ns for the i r own pur poses . 
The s ec ond part of t he l oote d gold, wa s the 
gol d which wa s take n out of the tee t h of  
concentr ation camp victi ms, t he 
gol d bracelets that came off t h
e wrists of wo me n, etcetera, 
etceter a. And in that particular categor y of
 quote, "looted gol d," unquote, we ge nerally 
included looted gold and other assets because, in 
that same general cat
egor y, we're talking  
about paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera,
 etcetera. All the valu
ables, the personal 
valuable s that people would have
. Now, a certai n amount of t h at
, going ba c k strictl y to t he 
gol d, wa s looted by the  
gol d... l oot e d by the Ger ma ns , a
nd melted down by the m, a nd use d  
by t he m for  their own warti me  pur pos es. I he
sitate a little bit wh
en I  say "warti me  
pur poses," because I a m reasonably
 convinced wit hout ha
ving any parti cular 
proof of it, that  
a subst antia l a mount of t h at we
nt  int o t he poc ket s of t he  indivi duals , t he i ndi vidual Ge r m ans  
who were t h ere i n t he concentrati on camps, 
the guards, etcetera, et
cete r a, the pe ople  who 
had c ont rol of it, a nd s o forth.
 The Ger mans were  pretty good at
 keeping track of things like 
this because they didn't
 want the guards to be profiting in
stead of the authorities back in  
Berli n, but I ' m sur e that , since i n al most ev
ery other c ase t here 's 
been some indi vi dual  
looti ng, ther e probabl y would have bee n a cons
i dera ble a mo unt of i ndi vi dual l ooti ng in this  
partic ular c a se. So, s o me of 
that, t h ough, may have dis appear
ed into the pockets of the 
guar ds, etcet era. But a large amo
unt of that gold we nt bac k t o s melti ng e stabli shme nt s in 
Ger ma n y a n d was  s me l ted down. And t he n, pr
obabl y, having bee n s melte d, ha d t he  
Reichsbank stamps put on
 it. And, all in all, 
probability, the Reichsba
nk stamps dated back 
fi ve or te n years or s o me thing lik
e that so that it look
ed j ust  li ke gold tha t  had bee n i n the  
Reic hs ba nk Ce ntral Ba nk de pos itori e s for years .
 Now, the Swis s kne w a t  the be gi nni ng of 
the war, approximately how mu
ch gold reserves t he German
 centra l ba nk did ha ve. An d 
they know t hat duri ng t h e cour
se of t he war , mor e  gol d we nt
 through Swi t zerland t han was 
in those depositories at the be
gi nni ng. So, e ver ybody 
there, I think, has 
been consci ous of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
23 
 
the fact t hat a large part of th
at gol d had t o be l o oted i n one 
s ense or the other. I n the s ense  
of havi ng c o me fr om t he  central ba nk deposit o
ri es of the , what shoul d have be en Be lgian 
gol d, or Albania n gold, or Fre nc h
 gol d or some thi ng li ke t hat , 
Ce ntral Ba nk gold, a nd on the  
other side , gold t hat ca me out of the concentr
ation ca mps or out of 
just stealing the stuff 
fr om t he Je ws  who had not  be
en put into a concentration 
ca mp, but whos e home s wer e  
loote d. So, t hat gold has  been a s ubstanti al 
part of the di scussio
n. The questi on of what  
actuall y happened wit h r espe ct to the  gol d th
at passed through Switzer
la nd, or ca me  i nto  
Switzerl and, is, I think, one that ma ybe Mr . Vol cker
9
 and others will be able to find out 
more cl earl y  about . A lar ge part of t h at gold, 
I t hi nk, was just  trans ferre d back, tra ns fer red 
by the Germans, converted into Swiss francs
, and the Swiss francs
 wer e used by t h e  
Ger mans t o purchase whatever it 
wa s they wa nt ed to p urc ha se
, war mat erials in t he first  
place , or s o met hing else . Some  
of that gold probably remain
ed in Switzerland. How much  
remained in Switzerland, I do not
 know. I don't, I doubt that ve
ry much of it 
di d r e mai n in 
Switzerl and, bec aus e I t h ink it  ha d a l l  bee n use d, t o the e xtent t hat it possi bl y c oul d be used. 

We did wor k out an agr eemen
t with the Swiss in which th
ey wo uld ma ke a payme nt on 
account  of looted gold to the I nter nati onal , 
t he Tri partite Gol d Comm
i ssi on. And a payment  
of that sort wa s ma de . Beyond that, I don't know
. How much of thi s gol d ca n be ide nti fie d a s  
havi ng come fr om t he people who wer e in 
t he concentr ation camp
s a n d how muc h  their  
clai ms , t here fore, s hould be , I  do not know
. I notice in the newspa
pers, there wa s some 
complaint about the fact
 that the amount 
of money that's still in th
e Federal Reserve in New  
York, under the control of th
e Tripartite Gold Co
mmission, some paym
ents were being 
ma de t o governme nts , li ke the 
Alba nian gover n me nt, rather  th
an to i ndi viduals . Sinc e the  
governme nt s  got bac k le s s than
, a lot less than 100% of what
 was l oote d from the m, I 'm not 
sure that that's a legitimate 
complaint. I think the governments
 are entitled to get their gold 
bac k. How much of the  
gol d t hat came out of t eeth, etcete

A: Cloaki ng in the s ens e of Swis s usi ng their na mes to
 di sguis e the fact t h at a partic ul ar asset wa s  
really a Ger man asset. For exam
ple , the bigges t ca se, whic h wa s one , one t h at caus es a lot of 
di ffic ulty and whic h you fi nd a 
lot about in the records of th
e Justice De part me nt her e and 
so forth, was the IG Chemie case. IG Ch emie 
was  a Swiss cor porati on. It wa s acc use d by us  
and by other s of being a cloa k fo
r I.G. Farbe n. And the holdi n gs
 in the United States of IG 
Che mie i ncl ude d Ge ner al Dye stuff( ph) Corpora

closel y connected wit h Genera
l Aniline and Film, 
which again, was a very large company 
whi c h ri vale d Koda k at one ti me . But Ge ner a
l Aniline Film and Ge
neral Dyest u ff were 
Ameri can corporations, presumab
l y owned by I G Che mie . Our , 
our, our ar gume nt was tha t  
IG Chemie was reall y a cloak 
for IG Farben. And that 's what
 I me an by cloa ki ng. The r e  
wer e many cases, much less dram
atic than that, much smaller 
than that, in which an asset  
owne d by M r ., we™l l sa y, Mr. Ha ns Schmidt , us
e t hat n a me I a l wa ys use , in  Ne w Yo rk wa s  
held in the name of Mr. John 
Jones ,  or whate ver  his  na me  
c oul d have  been, well , it  wa s  
cloaking. And t hat was the case,
 of course  als o, i n, in a nu
mber of situations in Lati n 
Ameri ca, where compani es were
...per fe ctly non- Ger man c o mpanies were a ccus ed of be ing  
cloaks for  the Ger man, real
 owners , of the  pr operty. 
Q:And Durham had writt
en, you said, written ex
tensively about this? 
A:No, Durham, Durham had never 
written, as far as I know, anythi
ng about it. He was a junior 
member of the, William Rapp
ard(ph), I'm not sure how mu
ch he had written about the 
subj ect, I wr ote a lot mo re than
 he  di d on t her e...and a fello
w na me d Bor char d(ph) he re in  
the United States, who was a pr
ofessor of law at Yale, had 
written quite a bit about the 
subj ect, the general subj ect of 
whether it was possible to take
 enemy pr ivate 
assets and use 
the m for re parati ons purpos es , basi cally, that
 was the issue. But 
Rappard was the, the  
eminent international lawy
er on t he, on t he Swis s del egati o
n, so that when 
we were talking 
about heirless assets and the 
utilization of German assets in
 Switzerland, private Germa n  
asset s in Switzerla nd, for , for repa rati ons purpos es , for pa yment of the repa ration cl ai ms  of  
the All i es , it would be Rappard 
who would tal k a bout the ge nera
l rules of international law 
whi ch prot e cted t he e ne my pri vate asset s, a nd 
I keep emphasizing priv
ate, i n the neutral  
countries, or indeed, in
 hostile countries. Becau
se Borchard here and 
Paul, I think his first 
na me wa s Paul, maybe not, but Pr ofe ssor Borc har d
 at Yal e wr ote arti cles whi ch are on file 
now which said t hat , under  the 
rules of international law, 
the assets of enemy private 
indi viduals wer e, in e ffe ct, sacr os anc t  and co
ul d not be confi scate d, e ven by their ene mie s.  
That i s, the Uni t ed States would 
be a llowed, unde r his the ory, to
 take over the assets in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
27 
 
Uni t ed Stat es bel onging to the Ger man go
ve rnment or ma ybe to s e mi - gover nme ntal  
corporati ons, if t here wer e such. But i f t here 
wa s a  privat e indi vidual in Ge r ma ny, who had a  
bank a ccount in Ne w York, t h
at ba nk acc ount coul d not  be ta ken by t he Unite d State s  
governme nt and use d for  reparati on payme nts or
 war claim payments 
in the United States.  
Because under international law, 
it was a pri vate asset of an ene my nati onal. That is one of  
the big ar gument s whi ch you can find...my 
articles on that subject  and Pr ofessor  
Bor chard's( p h) arti cle on the subject and t he 
article...sort of takes 
a position closer to 
Borchard(ph), but somewhat
 intermediate, written by 
a fellow named Otto(ph) 
Summerick(ph)...Otto Su
mmerick was a lawyer 
in Ne w Yor k Cit y of Ger ma n ba ckground , 
but those three articles are in a publication 
put out by the Duke Uni ve r sity Law School  
entitled, "Law and Contempo
rary Problems," and I 
think it's the issue,
 maybe the summer of 
1952, s o met hing li ke that . 
Q: What a bout the Amer ican delegati on, aside fr om
 yours el f. Can you ta lk
 about who else was  
there? 
A: We ll, t he Ameri can de legati on for the ne got ia
ti on of t he Swis s was he ade d by Ra ndol ph Paul . 
Ra ndolph Pa ul was  a ver y, ver y disti nguished, 
ha d been a ver y di stingui shed ta x l a wye r , h e  
had bee n the general c o uns el of the  Treas ury 
Departme nt during a good part of the war 

years . And he was one of the pe
ople who participated in the 
formulation of the negotiations 
wit h the Swi ss and s o for t h. He hea de d the Un
ite d State s de lega tion. I was hi s de put y. I was 
in the State Depart ment, and...I'm not sure 
whether it was then still 
called the Foreign Funds  
Contr ol Di vi sion or whet her it wa s ca lled the , le
t 's see, one moment wh
ile I think about that.  
I think it was the Divi

But, there was a transition in
 the State Department fro m 
For eign Funds Contr ol t o Ene my Pr opert y Contr o

Austria . I be ca me the De put y Dir ector of t he 
Divi sion...of t he Offic e
 of Enemy Ec onomic  
Wa r fare , Ec ono mic Cont rols. In 
any case , I was  on the  del egat i on a s Mr . Paul 's deputy. On 
the delegation was a fellow na med Orvis Schmidt who was, you 
would have to get his title 
fr om some body else , but  he was in t h e, ba sical
l y, t he Office of For eig
n Funds Control of the 
Trea sur y De part me nt. And I ™ m not s ure whether 
he wa s a ctually on the  delegati on or  not , 
but t her e was a fellow who t ook
 an active part of it na med 
John Pail ey( ph), who wa s M r . 
Sch midt 's boss in the Tre asur y Depart me nt. Th
e r e wer e a coupl e of othe r pe ople who we re  
very actively enga ge d in i t . And I r eall y can't
 re me mber how many people wer e act uall y on  
the, on the delegation. I thin
k my de puty, Walt er Surr ey( ph) , wa s act uall y on t he dele gation. 
And i n the Trea sur y De part me nt, pr oba bly, 
a  fel low na med J oe Duboy( ph), Doobwa h(ph), 
Do ob ois e (p h ) , D- U- B- O- I-S, wa s, wa s on it. An d 
a...very actively on
 the delegation was a 
fel l ow na me d J a mes  Ma nn( ph) , who was  later  
in the American legation in Berne as a 
Treasur y Depart ment representative in Ber ne, Switzerland, and he was very active in all this.  

He a nd Or vi s Sc hmidt were pr oba bly the ones wh
o deal t the most with t h e issues of l oote d  
gol d beca use  that  was an issue  whi ch see me d pe
culiarly to fall in the 
hands of the Treasury 
De part me nt rather  than
 t he Stat e Depart ment . And t hat pr
ett y much made up the Amer ican, 
Ameri can de legati on. Ra ndolph 
Pa ul wa s t he hea d  of the  
delegation and very active. 
Q:Is  it  true , a s far  as  you know, t hat  you're t h
e  onl y pers on of t hat dele gati on t hat sur vives?  

A:I  was  the  onl y pers on what?  

Q: You're t he  only per son survi vi ng?  

A:I am the, I am th
e only one of the negotiators in these ne
gotiations who is su
rviving in the sense 
that I was the head of the negotia
tion in all, all fo ur of thes
e negoti ations  a nd so far  as  the  
Swiss, so far as
 the Swiss, French, British 
and so forth, I'm the only
 one. Randol
ph Paul is 
dea d, so I ' m the...t he othe r pe ople  on t he Amer
i can dele gati on a nd t he 
Swiss thing, well, Jim 
Mann is dea d, Ra ndolph, well Ra ndolph is dea d
, Walt er Sur r ey is de
ad. I can't think of 
anybody else on the delegation 
who has  survi ve d. There i s one
 ot her pe rson who is  alive  
who knows a good de al, deal ab
out t his and that is Mort on 
Bock( ph) , whose na me I ma y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0449  
29 
 
have menti o ned be fore, who's livi ng up here in
 Wa shi ngt on, not far a w a y from wher e I a m  
now, who's still a good friend of 
mine. He's ten 
years older than I am, 
so, it gives me hop e  
that I'll be able to go on for 
a little while longer anyway. And he was around
 in, probably in  
the Treasury Depart ment , at the 
time of these negotiations. I ha
ve a difficulty
 re me mb e r ing  
whether Mort was act ually in 
t he Tr easur y De pa rt me nt . I guess he was in the Trea s ury  
De part me nt , ma ybe dur i ng the ne gotiati ons . He ma y ha ve  actuall y gone over t o  the 

Ameri can Legati on i n Berne at 
the time, but he pr
obabl y would have come bac k for  the  
negotiati ons if he  ha d be en over  
there. Bu t I, I, I know abou
t  Mort  ver y well , but I c an't  
remember really whet he
r  he sat i n on t hese  negotiat ions  or  not .  
Q:And some thing about the tone of
 the negotiati ons. You me nti one d 
that Mr . Stucki was very st ern 
and s o me what di sta nt per son, but  di d t h
at set the tone fo
r the negotiations? 
A: Ye s, it di d. The ne got iations were  not ver y, not ver y fri endly except for the fact t hat I beca m e  
very friendly with a fe w of th
e people aft er war d, li ke Shta yb
ur ger(ph) , who wa s a wonderful  
guy a nd who was  not as  ster n a s t hat . But  Stuc
ki was a rather sti ff,
 you might call middle 
European bureaucrat, diplomat. An d 
he t ook very strongl y t he , th
e, the Swiss line that there 
was no entitlement on the part of 
the Allies to any of these Germ
an assets in Switzerland, let  
alone the hei rless assets. And, t h
at was the line which he took very, ver y s trongly. I mi ght 

deviate a little bit here to say 
that, that same line,
 basically, was 
taken by a very different  
pers on whose na me was E mil Sa ndstr öm, who 
was head of the Swedish delegation.  
Sandstr ö m had bee n a j ustice of the  Supr e me 
Court of Swe den, he was  the hea d of the  
Lea gue  of Red Cr oss  Societies ,
11
 he was a wonderful, wonderfu
l, ma n. And he, as a la wyer 
and as a Swede, took the same line, that th
e Allies were not entitled 
to the German private  
assets in, in, in Swed
en. But the Swedish attitude was, ok
ay, fellas, we do
n't think you're  
entitled to these things, 
but we think we should
 be making some kind
 of contribution, not 
                     
   1 1
 Perhaps M r . Rubi n is  re

only to, to the A
llied reparations fi nances, bu
t also to the refu gees. Th
ey had taken in a lot of 
refugees , of cour se, duri ng the war a nd, basic a
lly, what we 'll do, a ca
l cul a tion. How much 
you think you'll be entitled to a
nd we'l l make that available as 
a pro bono gift. 
So we give it 
to you as a gift , you take it as
 your due, whatever t h
e theor y, the money get s over t here. And 
then we don't have to 
argue about the law of t he, t he int e
rnational law with 
respect to enemy 
privat e pr operty, e ne my privat e pr operty. So t hat
, that, that the negotiations with the Swedes  
we nt s wi m mi ngl y a nd very
...on a  very fri endly basis . With
 the Swiss, they were stiff an d 
Stucki, having said you're not entitled to anything, fo r qu
ite awhile, went back to 
Switzerl and for further consultati
on, t hen he  ca me  bac k here  
a nd prett y mu ch r eiterat ed the  
sa me poi nt. And t he n I s uppos e I ma de, well, some body™ s de sc
ribed me  a s ha ving ma de a  
moral ar gument, which ma y or ma
y not have had some ki nd of e f
fect , tha t  not only ar e we  
entitled to this legally, but th
ere™s a moral obligation on the 
part of Switzerland because  
Switzerland, well, they allegedl
y ar me d t he ms e lves to r esis t  any a ggr es sion i f it  shoul d 

come and di d not bear  a ny of t h
e real costs of the war and al
l  sorts  of ot he r pe opl e did. And 
we  arri ved at  the  c oncl usi on. 
Q: Do  you reme mb er delive
ring that opinion in... 
A: Oh , I  re me mber sa yi
ng it in one of the meetin
gs, yes. Yes. I don't reme
mber whether I put it in  
writi ng or  not. 
Q: Do  y ou  re me mb er  th e resp
onse, do you reme mb er... 
A: Oh , th e re spo nse wa s one o f well,
 ma ybe, or somet hing. 
It wa s not a ve ry...it 
wa s not yes, you've  
convinced us and her e y
ou are wi th t he money. But i n t he en
d, they went b
ack and t hey di d  
come ba ck wit h a proposal, as I sa y, whi ch was 
not as satisfactory as I would have liked it to 

be, but it was better than
 sayi ng get  out of our  hair , we™r
e not  going t o give  you a  ni ckel . 
Q: How important do you th
ink wa s your ar gu me nt i n t urni ng the m around? 
A:M y mo ral  argu me nt?   

Q: Ho ne stly , I mea n. ..

A:Honestly, I thin
k it ha d some e ffect . I think it ha d some  e f fe c t . I thi nk t hat  it ma y have  had s o me  
effect, more because th
ey began to think a little bit about 
the public relations aspect than , 
than a ny other aspe ct of it. It may be , and 
I do not conde mn Mr. St uc
ki a s being a Na zi, I 
don™t t hink he wa s, he wa s a ve
r y s tern, sti ff Swis s dipl omat. 
But I have sort of a feeling,  
and he was you know, sympathetic 
in the sense of what
 ha d be en going on, but I s us pect  that  
basically, what he began to 
think about was the 
possibility that there not only was a 
plausibl e legal argume nt whi ch t he y c onti nue d to
 deny, but I a m c onvinced that my rhet ori c  
wa s sufficiently good, my logic 
s u ffic iently good a nd my de mo ns
tration sufficie
ntly good so 
that maybe I  incul cated a few 
doubts even in
 the  mi nd of pe ople  like Pr ofes sor Borc har d(ph) 
up at Yale . And I think 
ma ybe I did the sa me th
ing with Mr . Stuc ki 
and ma ybe wit h...a nd  
certainly with Mr. Rappard(ph). 
But t hen I thi nk a l so, t he mora l argume nt a ppe aled t o the m 
in a sense because maybe ther
e was... it had some effect 
as a moral ar gument and more 
because it had an effe ct as 
an argument they thought ab
out as a possibility of public 
relations. What's going 
to happen if the Allies 
really come fo rward w
ith this and they say 
that on, on a moral basi
s , the  Swi ss have be en bastar ds. 
That, I think, pr
obably had some  
effect . How much effect, I do not
 know. I ain™t no psychologist. 
Q: Yeah, but they also had a tremendou s interest  in
 furthering their posit ion as an i n ternati onal 
center of fi nance in the future
, so the y...t hat 's wha t you... 
A: Oh yes, I 'm sure, I ' m sure that the fact that 
these argument s were bei
ng made on a mo ral basis, 
etceter a, had a, had a considerable effect. They
're  thinki ng a b out their fut ure relati ons. The  
British, on their side, were th
inking about being a little more
 lenient, I think, than the 
Ameri cans wer e, parti al l y becaus
e t hey want ed to re- establish 
financial relations with the 
Swiss , and I have no doubt tha t  the Swiss wa
nted to re-establish fi
nancial relations with 
ever ybody. That , of course, wa s 
one  of t he re asons why the y  we
re so i nsi stent a nd so they 
were so anxious about getting 
rid of the proclaimed list, 
getting rid of 
the blacklist.

Q: An d wa s  the,  the  eli mi nati on o f
 the blac kli st a di rect poi nt of ne gotiat i on?  Wa s, was t hat  
something that you all as
 me mber s of that dele gati on ha d contr ol over?  
A: Oh, yes, yes. That was central to t h e negotiati on
s, of c ourse. The Swiss 
wer e sayi ng, one of the  
things we ha ve to ha ve is  the eli mi nati on of 
the bla cklist . And we we
re sa yi ng, you don™ t get 
that until we get this 
agreement. And then we
 s aid, as  soon as you get the a gre e me nt...I  
think, I ' m trying t o thi nk whether 
we said a s soon as you get the 
agree ment or as soon as the 
agreement is impl emented, you get rid of the blacklist. To my shame, I really can™t 
reme mb er which one we said. 
I think probably we
 said so methi ng about  i m ple me ntati on. 
Q: Because they had to go back an
d have, this...agreement
 had to be r ati fie d  by t heir parl ia ment . 
A:It  ha d t o be rati fi ed by their Pa

that 's right. And I remember , and this is in the 
comme nts which I ma de ...t he a r

further on. They had a ve ry c o
mp etent ambassador here in

recollection is that we talked
 wit h hi m and he wa s very an
xious to have this agreement 
concluded. I ' m, I ' m not ...I don't re ca ll ver y mu
c h tha t , t hat , that he

that he was anxious to

Q: Do you, do you recal l Presi den
t Tr uman ever expre

A:I do not recall t hat we

, that  I...I  don't recall  
any parti cular  expression 
from hi m. I was re asona bly sur e t hat  we had hi s suppor

 through back 
channel s as  
much as t hey do at  the presen

any back channels
 at the Wh ite  
Hous e anyway. Even Ra ndo

that he eve r  sa w Mr. Truma n  
about this. But, you kn
ow, the thesis wa s, wh

we  want ed a nd we never  ha d a ny lac k of s uppor

White Hous e, why don't  you 
go to s ee the , why don't 
you cal l  in the a mbassa dor
13
 and tell 
the ambassador in, here sitting in
 the Oval Office, that if th
ey don't do something, we'r e  
goi ng to be i n, they're going t o be i n very ba d

 have done that, we 
never thought about doi ng it , as far as I know. 
And I don't think tha t Randolph Paul ever

A:We ll, I might talk a lit
tle bit about the Swedish 
negotiations just because 
it, it does fo rm a very  
big contrast  t o the Swiss . And 
t here's an arti cle i n, i n one of
 t he Swiss  ne wspapers , t he Swis s  
interviewed me a 
little while ago and ther

A:I f  you l i ke , I don™t know whet her 
this is releva nt to this oral hi
st ory or  not, you know, I wa s ver y  
much invol ved i n t he ne gotiat ion
s with t he Hague and,
 and that sort of thing. I think to a 
certain extent, but let me talk 
a little bit about the, 
the, the restitution pr
ocess, the Jewish 
Restitution Succes

 because t hat  is very much involved here and pe ople 
are s ayi ng that the J e ws  didn™

Q: Ok ay . Her e  we are  ba c k, ok ay .  

A:I t hink what I woul d li ke to me nti o n, brie fl y, I™ ve 
only r ead two t hi ngs , r e a
lly. One is the question 
of the cont r ast bet w een the Swi ss and the 
Swe dish negotia tions . In bot h case s, we wer e  

looking for pretty muc h the sa
me  thi ng. We were  looking for 
the Ger ma n asset s in t he two  
countries, to take for reparatio
n purposes. We were 
looking for restitution 
of looted gold, if 
there were any looted gold there, and we were 
looking for some kind of

to the pe rse cutee s. In neither ca se , did we 
ha ve  any pr oble m with re spect to indivi dual  
clai ms of pe ople who ha d come 
i n a nd identi fi ed their proper ty. Ther e ne ver was a ny, any 
issue about t hat. So far as the 
Swedes wer e concer ned, they al
so made a contribution so far  
as the I nter government a
l Committee for Refu gees
15
 wa s c onc erne d. But so for the 
di ffere nce  between the  t wo ne got iati ons , wa s that  
the Swiss were very, ve
ry sticky so far as 
the legal aspects were 
concerned. Maybe legiti mately, I 
don™t know. There 
still are people 
who ar gue t hat e ne my private proper ty is, i s sa
c r osa nct a nd ma ybe not.
 And they al so were 
very difficult with resp
ect to the one aspect, that I think 
is very important, the question of 
identi ficati o n of, of hei r l ess as se
ts i n, in Switz erla nd. I n that particul ar cas e, it see ms  t o me, 

they could very well at t hat partic ula r  poi nt, ha
ve  done basica l l y what 
Paul Volcker is doing 
at the pres e nt ti me, wit h much le ss  troubl e tha n Mr. Volc ker is ha ving to go thr ough:  

identi fy, i f not 100 per cent of t he heirle ss 
as se ts, at lea st 95 perce nt or 85 perc e nt or 
something like that, and res
tituted those to an, a successo
r organization like the Jewish 
Restitution Successor 
Organization which was operating very
 successfully back in those 
days, and r i ght acr oss the bor der in Ger ma
n y .  On t h e J e wi sh Re
stitution Successor 
Or gani zation, I think it's important to note, in
 c onnecti on with t he,
 the pos sibl e, the i r  
pos sibl e rol e in, in Switz erla nd, their possi
ble role as a successful  organizati o n in 
Switzerl and, that they did exac
tly t hat in t he Ameri can Z
one of Germany, very, very 
successfull y. The JRSO did obtai n a tremendous
 a mount of, of pr operty i n  Ger ma ny which 
had bee n looted from J e ws and s o fort h, and th
at was, was properly resti t ute d, etc etera . They  
also were able to participate 
in the negotiations with the Ge

issue  of t he, of restit uti o n of j obs , of taki ng
 car e of people  who ha d bee n  in conce ntr ation 
ca mps a nd givi ng the m  some ki

the JRSO could ha ve bee n a  ver y, ver y e ffecti v

difficulty of identification of 
heirless assets, even in Switzer
la nd. We had t he sa me  pr oble m 
here i n t he Uni t ed St ate s. We  had proper t y i n
 t h e Unite d Sta t es whi ch was veste d by the  
Alie n Pr ope r t y Custodia n, on the grounds that 
it ha d come from Ger ma ny. And ther e was  no

who di ed i n Ber ge n- Bels en or where ver, or

 exc ept  
by t aki ng a l ook at  the  na me s. 
I f you didn't  ha ve  t he na me s, ba

the ac count had bee n e st ablis hed by some body 
i n  Ger ma n y a n d i f the na me was a mbiguous 
and so forth, you didn't really 
know. We  claim,  we
, the JSRO in the United Stat es , clai m 
that there should be about three million dolla

te, and that was an  
esti mate ma de on the ver y, ver y crude  business of
 taking a look at name

like that, i n the as sets which ha d bee n ve st

wer e bei ng t urned over t o the War Clai ms Co

Uni t ed States war  clai ms. Nego

down to a fi gure of three m

amount of money whic
h we thought would  
be ade quate for this parti cular veste d, veste d 
ass et , a mount of heirle ss as se ts. The n that  had 
to be r educed, because t h e War 
Claims Commission an
d ot hers would re fuse
 to accept it, to 
one million, and in 
the end, we ha
d the Congress pass legislati
on which gave to the JRSO, 
only half a million dollars. Which 
indicates the difficulty of ha
ving, of identifying heirless 
asset s even i n a sit uati on wher

A:...people who ar

I can not really be
lieve that these

to t his , this kind of a ccount , ve
ry, very signific
ant in terms of 
the tot al a m ounts that ha ve be en ma de avail abl
e t o the persecutees. 
The t o tal a mounts ma de  
availa ble t o perse cut ees come , bas i ca lly, out of 
all  sorts of sources, but I , I think, pr i mar ily,  
out of the s ourc es that ca me from Ger ma n
y in connecti on wit h the Ha gue negotiat i ons , 

whi ch, at Vassa nar( ph) in wh
ich I participated in 1952 an
d '53, where we negotiat e d on  
behalf of both the government of Israel on 
t he one si de a n d the Confe r ence on Je wis h 
Material  Cl ai ms Agains t Ger ma ny on t he  ot her  side, as t h e t wo Je wis h or ga nizati ons ,

 there, and there have been negotiations  
whi ch have bee n going on e ver 
si nc e, and there has bee n a 
l ot of mone y whi ch has bee n  

paid int o va rious  ac counts wh
i ch, I t hink, has  gone t o re co
mpense persecutees and t h eir  
survi vors, et cetera. I 'm not sayi ng, as I say, 
that t he pe ople who survi ved and the heir s  and 
so forth, are not entitled
. They're very much en
titled to everything th
at they, they could  
possibly get. Certainly, they'r
e entitled, if they can establish 
claims, to the property which 
wa s le ft by one of their  own ancest ors. And 
certainl y, al so, they're enti tled to what ever

a mount that 's goi ng t o go into the heir less as se
t pot  is goi ng to be mi nu
scul e compared t o the 
a mounts  whi ch have alr e ady gone
 in and so forth. And that, I 
think, is probably true even 
wit h re spe ct  to l oot ed gold. Ther e ma y be so
me looted gold which 
should be recovered, 
whi ch has c o me out of t he conce ntra tion c a mps
, but you ha ve  to re
me mbe r , a lar ge a m ount  
of that l oote d gol d was r ecovere d in Ger ma n y its
elf. It was r ecovered at the, at t he death  
camps. I know that one of the offici al s 
of the International 
Re fuge e Or gani zation
17
 came to 
Switzerland with a couple of je
rry cans filled with br
acelets and gold teet
h and so forth, and 
brought them into the Ameri
can legation in Switz
erla nd, and by a rra nge me nt  wit h t he m,  
they were taken over t o a, 
a  cooperat ing Swis s ba
nk and they wer e...t hos
e things were all 
s melte d down and t he pr ocee ds were paid t o 
the International Refug

account of t he, of t he survi vor s and so, pai d in
t o the, i nto t he inter est of the...probably  
through t he Je wish Age n cy a nd 
the JDC, but they went for th
e  pur poses  a b out ...but mos t  of  
that stuff was probabl y recove
re d i n , in Ger ma n y its el f. A l a
rge a mount  of it  must have 
disa ppe are d, as I say, a large pa rt of it was conf
iscated, a large part probably confiscat ed by  
guar ds at the camps, and a certai n amount of it,
 certainly, went into 
the smelting pot s and 
wa s eve ntua lly sta mped and c a me out agai n as t he, wit h the  Reic hs bank sta mp on it . So 
there ma y be some  addit i onal a m
ount avail able t here. How much
 is a, is a matter which I 

think will be  very di ffi cult to tell. One othe
r thing about t he Swiss, and the clai m agai nst

much of the German go

.Jew..some 
property still there, either gold

of t he Swis s  pri vate  ba nks, or  in the  ha nds of

difficult to, to tell about that. I, I think the am

talke d about  recentl y, ar e, are s ubst a ntiall y ex
a ggerated. And, about t he only thi ng I would  
like to add at the present time
, is that I think the Swiss ar

reluct antl y and maybe under compul si on, ma king a n
 effort to do somet hing about it, de s pite  
the charges whi c h wer e  ma

And be yond that , so far as t h

 that I was, as I said, a memb
