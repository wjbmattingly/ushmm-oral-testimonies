Questi on: I 'd like you t o begi n by 
telli ng me your na me a
nd your na me  at t h e ti
me o f t h e  war ,  wh er e  
you wer e born, and whe n  you were  born, ple ase .   

An s wer: Sur e .  I wa s b or n o n Octo
ber  26t h, '37 in a city calle d De br
ec en i n Hungary, a n d my give n 
na me was Ver oni ca Suzannah.  Or  Hungaria n, 
actually, it 's Veroni k Suza nna h ( ph).  And my  
He bre w na me was Wi s colar ( ph).  My pare nts ca
me -- bot h of t he m fr om
 religious home s, and 
while they were not Ort
hodox, they still kept very
 much the traditi
on, what you wo
uld call strong 
conservatives nowadays.  
And shortl y or a  coupl e of ye ars  a f
ter my birt h, I a
ssu me  my  p a re nts  
move d t o a c ity t hat  today is 
Roma nia called Kol oz svár  or  Cluj . 

Q: Actually, you didn't -- I don'
t you s aid your l ast  na me . 
A: Oh, I'm so sorry.  My fa mi ly 
name  was Moskovitz (ph) by birth. 
Q: Do you have  any me mories  of 
De brece n or you wer e t oo young?  

A: My onl y me morie s of Debr ece n is  really my 
gr andpare nts ' house , whic h I a m as sumi ng I visit e d 
as a young c hild of t hre e or four.  Ca me t o vi
s it Gra ndma and Gr andpa , a
nd I had unc l es and aunt s  
there a nd s p ent wonder f ul ti mes wit h the m.  Ver y 
pa mpere d, very love d.  It was very, very war m  

house.  I remember
 my grandfather picking me 
up.  They had this
 chandelier that hanging with little  
beads at the end, almost like a little 
skirt.  And he used to pick me 
up so I can touch it and play with 
it.  And I had really a lot of 
fon d me mo ries just  r e me mbe r in g  the furnit ur e an d re me mb erin g t he  
smells of the kitchen an
d sitting around th
e table and eating and roamin
g around in th
e courtyard 
and pl ayi ng outsi de.  All of thos e  me mories ar
e reall y ki nd of in my mi nd, ver y wonder ful 

me mo rie s  o f  visi tin
g my grandparents . 
Q: Di d you have  br othe rs or si ster s?

A: I have an older brother , who i s
 se ve n and a hal f years older t han
 I a m.  And, of c our se , my ol der  
brot her played a bi g role  in my li fe , espe ciall y in
 thos e da ys .  Ther e were  just the t wo of us , and 
beca use he wa s seve n a nd a hal f ye ars older, he  had di ffe r e nt intere sts .  And aside from tr ying t o 
pester me because he enjoyed seei ng me scream
i ng or laughi ng or whatev
er  it was, really our  
relations hip wa s like a younger si bl
i ng looki ng up to al most an adu
lt.  He was -- I al most al ways  
admired him, and I was in awe of 
him.  He was -- the ag
e differences were so 
great until we grew u p  
to be adults.  In adulthood, now
 tha t we are  both a dult s, I  cons
ide r  hi m my younger brot her . 
Because it turned out that I think 
I ' m t he mor e  mat ure o ne a nd he 's 
the softe r  one .  So it 's a mazi ng  
how the roles switch la
ter  on i n li fe.   
 

01: 04: 44 

 

Q: What kind of busi ne ss  was  your
 fa mily in?  Di d your
 pare nts wor k, wha t  ki nd of li fe style?  
A: Well, my father
 came  fro m a little village 
near Debrecen.  He was on
e of 13 children.  There 
wer e -- act ually, t her e were 15 chil dr en born t o t hat
 fa mil y, a nd 13 of t he m 
gre w up t o adulthood. 

And the y we re of ver y mode st m
eans.  My mot her came
 from a much more pr
osperous background, 
but at t he ti me of their mar riage alr eady ti mes ch
ange d for t he wor se.  And my gra ndpare nts didn't  
have what they had before
, and so they had very li
ttle.  My parents got marrie
d and for a while, they  
had a bake r y.  And t hen that fi zzle d awa y, a nd t h
at 's whe n they move d ba
ck to my grandparents' 
town,  to  De brece n,  whe r e I wa s b o
r n.  And fr om t her e, t he y pi ck
e d up, and they went t o Cluj  

because t her e was work in Cl uj.  
And it turns out that my father in
 Cluj wa s just a la borer .  The y  
really lived in a very mo
dest, modest life.  They didn't have 
much, and my 
mother knitted a lot. 
And I don't know i f s he sold s o me of her knitt ings or
 not, but really at that
 time financially they 
wer e c onside red poor. 

Q: I wa nt t o, I gue ss , a sk you 
more about  Cluj , bec ause  you 
we re s o young i n De brec en. 
A: Ri gh t.

Q: Di d you have a sense of wh ethe
r  or not  the r e was a strong Jewi sh
 communit y, i f your  fa mily was  
fri endly wit h  nei ghbors  who we re 
not Jewish?  I know th
at your family was re
ligious, but I'm trying 
to get a sense of how 
they were integrated 
with commun
ity was. 
A: In t he c o urtya r d wher e we li ve d, it  was kind of 
an apart ment buil ding that 
the fr ont to the street, 
wa s a fe w st ories high.  But in t h
e courtyard itself ther
e wa s li ke wha t  you would call a townhouse ,  
one-l eve l townhous es today, the a
ttached homes.  An d it kind of surro
unded, we nt li ke  an L-shape .  
And we li ve d in one of t hos e hous es
.  Now, we had ne ighbors , most of
 them were Jewi sh neighbors.  
But we also had the ma nager of 
this courtyard, the ma
na ger of that a part m
e nt buil ding who took  
care of the grounds a nd t ook c are of t he propert y, a
nd he wa s not Je wis h.  We wer e ver y fri endly.  I 
re me mb er p l ayin g wit h the c hildr e n .   I re me mb er
 the m putt ing up t he Chr i st ma s tr ee and me  
helpi ng hang up the wal nuts on the branche s of th
e tree.  So the parents 
wer e  very fr iendl y.  We  
lived in a community wher
e , of c ours e , there wer e quit e  a  fe
w Je wi sh  fa mili es.  Not Ort ho do x 
Jewish fa milies, but mode
rn Jewish famili es.  
 
 

 

 

01: 08: 02 

And yet , my parents wer e always ve
r y Zi onis tic, a nd they de finitely sa w 
to it that in sp
ite of the fact 
that the y didn't ha ve a lot  of mone y, s o to spe ak, th
ey rai sed us in a Jewish
 school.  Wh
at would b e  
like a J ewi s h day sc hool  today.  My brot her went
 to t he Hebr ew Gymnasi u m in Kol ozsvár , and I  
was in the kinder gart en t hat bel ong
ed to t hat  sc hool.  
And so he wa s al rea dy i n t he  upper gra des , 
and I was -- just before we were 
ta ken a way, I wa s  about  to st ar t firs
t  gr ade .  In the  ki nde rgarte n, of 
cour se, we  l earne d about  all t he  holidays  and lit tle
 Hebr ew s ongs and Hung
arian songs and da nc e s  
and they read us stori es. 
 And everything that  at  that ti me they
 taught i n a kinder gart en.  And I went  
to t hat kinde rgarte n --  i n  the  sc hool, the chil dre n
 have to wear unifor ms.  So the unifor ms were 
always  na vy and a  white  shirt . 
 A na vy uni for m and a white shirt .
  That was the uni form for t h e

He bre w Gymnasi u m.  The boys have
 to wear hat s.  And I thi nk ther
e was  Star of Da vi d on t he hat ,  
if I ' m not  wr ong.  But e v en i f it  was n 't, by t he 
ti me it a ppr oac h ed 1943, eve rybody had t o wear the  
Je wish star , no matt er what, on t he 
st reet.  You c oul d not wal k out 
to t he street wit hout havi ng t he  
Je wish st ar s ewn on your  coat or se wn on your ja
cket or on your dr ess , de pending on t he sea son o f  
the year .  You really had t o wear
 it  like  a ba dge  on your c hes t. 
Q: We re you aware of any attack
s, verbal or physi
cal, on your fa mil y  or 
on your  brot her or  
yoursel f?  
A: Onl y on my brot her .  I was not much a war e of
 a nyt hing that wa s goi ng
 on out side.  I only was  
aware of t he fact that  I was tota
lly forbi dde n t o leave  
the c o urtya r d wher e we li ve d.  And I wa s  
always war n ed i f I ever y set foot 
out of the courtya rd, to ma ke s ure 
tha t I ha ve on me somet hing that 
has t he J e wi sh st ar on it .  Of c ourse , being so yo
ung, my mot he r  did not  look
 for wa r d t o  me  setti ng 
out my foot  outsi de t he  court yar
d, no matt er what.  And t h at 's un
derst a nda ble , but that was so 
i mpres sed on me as a young c hild 
that I was really sc ared to step outside.  And I liked to step 
outsi de , bec ause whe n I  steppe d out side t he c ourty
ar d in t he  base ment of t he buil ding ne xt door  

there was a candle fact or y. 
 And I remember l o
oking down t here , I was fa
scinate d how 
they made 
the candles.  How t hey dipped 
it in wa x with the wicks, you k
now, up a nd down goi ng i nto the  
melt ed wa x.  And I was j ust fas cin
ate d by t he whole pr oce ss.  So I 
looked to sit ou
tside, you know, 
kind of stoop down and watch ho
w the y were doi ng t hose  things , but  I was r eall y car e full y  
mo nit ore d.   I re me mb er  my  brot
her c o ming home  from sc hool , a n
d there was al ways an upheaval  
because he was chastised goi ng to 
school, chastised comi
ng back from s chool; 
he wa s taunt ed.  An d  
I must say, I had a very handsome
 brother that was not even -- in
itially was very ha
ndsome and the  
uni for m l ooked gr eat .  But t here were always -- 
hara ngued going to school and c o mi ng ba ck fro m  
school and fist fights would ensu
e coming home. 
 And also then in those 
days, people still rode in  
buggie s and carriage s a nd some bu
ses and vari ous tra ns por tation.  So t he kids reall y wal ke d t o  
school a nd c a me bac k fr om school
.  Nobody had cars, so
 nobody pic ked t he chil dre n up.  So it wa s  
a natura l thi ng for hi m t o wal k to sc hool and c o me
 back.  And my fat he r  
was a ver y  ethical and 
moral man, but  to so me exte nt
 I  thi n k wa s very naive .

And he fe lt t hat it 's unbec o ming a Je
wish young man t o fist  fight.  Th
at this is not something that --  
he di dn't teac h us that, a n d this a gainst  anyt hing th
at we stand for.  An d that either you reason or you 
talk, but you don't fi st fight.  Y
ou ar e not a hooligan.  I f
 y ou fi st  fi g h t ,  t h en  
you reduce yoursel f t o  
the gutter level.  And my
 brot her c a me home one day, and he 
had s o me body's foot pri nt on his na vy 
uni for m.  Obvi ousl y, some body kic k
ed hi m i n his behi nd.  And my
 fa ther got so angr y at  my  
brot her , and my brot her wa s a ver y mil d- ma nner e d 
young ma n.  But I gue ss ther e was just so muc h  
taunti ng t hat  he coul d ta ke and t here  on the way,
 and s o mebody physi cal ly
 attac ke d hi m.  An d 
some body ki cke d hi m i n hi
s be hind.  And I think my
 father a d ded hi s own hand to teac h hi m not t o  
get into brawls on the street, unfortunately.  S
o, But I re me mber my br ot
her who was very good at  
woodwork; he was very artistic young ma n.  He pain
ts a nd he scul pts and he does woodwork.  He 's  
an e xtre me l y tal ente d young - -  
he wa s an extremely talent ed yo
ung --  now, he 's a n e xtre mel y 
talente d young a dul t, older adult. 
 I c all hi m young adult , I s hould r
eally cal l hi m older  a dult .  And I  
remember him fash
ioning with -- fr om little wood, you know, 
handle and attaching a whip to it that 
wa s rolle d in his hand.  That was 
his protecti on goi ng t o sc hool, so 
i f s o me body attac ks hi m, he ca n 
whip this out.  And that 
kind of left a very strong 
impression on me 
as a chi ld.  That and the fact that  
my fat her  hit  hi m.  

Q: So you di d bec o me a war e at th
i s poi nt that t h ere were proble ms
?  I mean, it was different t o be  
Je wish?  

A: De finit el y.   

Q: Ca n you re me mber ot he
r le ssons you le arned fr om
 your par ents?   You we
re talking about not to 
fi ght  or  . . . 

A: Not reall y, wit h the - -  I shoul dn't  say not re al
ly, you know.  I t hi nk t he les sons --  I think the  
lessons were in spite of 
all difficulties and in sp
ite the horrendous times, th
e y di d not  hi de who they 
wer e.  The y kept  very str ong
ly the Jewish holidays.

They ma de  sure that my  brother became bar mitzva
hed at su ch a di fficult time.  I reme mb er  my  
brot her 's ba r  mitz vah i n the bi g te mple; it was a l
most e mpty.  And I re me mber st a ndi ng in t he 
Ort hodox synagogues i n thos e da ys , the wome n 
s at on t op on the sec ond level a nd l o oke d down. 
And the men were downstair
s.  I remember 
standing between the railing 
and watching my brother 
cha nting from his Ha ft or ah.  And 
no matt er what, Passover was Pass
over;  Rosh Ha sha nah was Rosh 
Ha sha na h; the Sabbat h was the Sabba t h.  All of those 
tra ditions wer e kept to the bitt er e nd.  Not hing 
wa s re ally hi dde n a w ay, and I t hink 
i t  ga ve me  a  sens e of understa
ndi ng a nd a s ense of als o s o me  
pride .  I was  not hidde n wa y, all of t hos e things we
r e not hi dden a wa y fr om us .  If anythi ng els e, i t  
just ma de  me stronger pr oba bly an
d more belie vi ng.  That  you just 
ca nnot  allow anybody t o tra mpl e 
over you. 

Q: How much was your
 regular li fe, as you kne w it, di srupt ed at that point in Hunga r y?   It wasn't  
physical ly occupied by t he 
Ge r man s.   Ho w mu ch  did  
li fe change?  Were t h er
e a lot of restrictions? 
A: There were restricti ons on what
 -- bet wee n what hour and what ho
ur you were all o we d to go ou t  
on t he stre et.  Je ws were  not allowe d on t he stre et  
at e ver y hour, eve ry da y of the -- e very hour  of 
the day.  There were rest rictions 
in te r ms of how often you were 
allowe d -- bet wee n what hour a nd 
what hour you ar e all o wed out on 
the street.  I'm sure it was very 
disr upt i ve to my par ents , to my 
mother.  My fa ther, 
who was still working at the ti
me, and then later on in 
'43 was taken to a forced 
labor ca mp.  My mot her being al one
 wit h t wo young chil dre n .  Sc hool
s ce ased t o e xist .  We wer e  
not all o wed to go t o school .  The 
Je wis h sc hool close d, a nd so we
 were pri maril y at home .  My  
brot her was very busy.  
Hi m a nd nei ghbors , they 
dug up a bunker in t he  fr ont , in t h e courtyar d,  
because ther e were a lot  of
 sirens and a lot of runn
ing to the shelter.   
 

01: 18: 07

And the shel ter was reall y not bel o
w ground level.  It wa s like a la
undr y room type of a  thing, where  
people washed.  And th
at  was t he shel ter.  And I  
re me mb er  th at  that  a ffecte d  me so met hi ng fierc e a s 
a child.  I was hysterical  every ti
me the sire n sounded.  I used to 
cry a n d screa m.  I  was just so 
utterl y sha ke n and a fr aid as
 a child fr om all these soun
ds .  And that a f fec t ed me lat er on i n life, too. 
Because for a long ti me when at t h
at poi nt was sil ent and not s crea mi n
g, but wh en we came to Israel 
and t he sire ns were  goi ng on b
ecause of t he War of I ndependenc
e, and there was never really 
compl ete peace.  There wasal ways t hat panic of will 
I make i t to t he shelt er 
or  won't  I make it to the 
shelter?  That always ensued, and at t i mes it woul
d just be a si ren over a n a mbul anc e t hat sounde d 
like a siren.  But once
 you hear it, it's like it shakes
 you up c o mpletel y.  So . . . 
Q: Di d you mai ntai n a  re lationshi p 
wi th this fa mily, this
 Christian fa mily that
 the  ma n, I  guess , was  
the l andlor d or t he superi ntende nt of 
your  buildi ng, once  thi ngs  got  wors e?  
A: I thi nk we had a r e lationshi p, 
a  cordi al rela tions hi p in t he cour
t yard.  We were never -- the  
relations hip wa s ne ver s uch t hat we -- the y ca me  
and vis ited and us , a nd at
e in our hous e, or we  
visited them and ate in their hous
e.  Those kind of thin
gs did not exist.  Bu
t until we were taken  
away, t hey li ved there and we 
lived there.  And until we 
were t a ken a wa y, de fi nitel y. 
Q: Do you r e me mbe r  your par e nt s 
talking about wh
at was going on or how 
they tried to comfort 
you, or  di d t hey e xplai n anyt hing?  
A: I don't r e me mber t hat  any of t his wa s dis cu
sse d with me .  I think my parent s pr oba bly s poke  
bet wee n the ms elve s, or t hey spoke  
to my br other, but none of this
 wa s s h ared wit h me.  I wa s --  
they fel t  probabl y that I wa s 
too young.  And I 'm s ure thos e di
sc ussi ons took plac e  between m y  
brot her and my mothe r , espe ciall y 
after my fat her  was taken away 
to labor camp.  He was the man  
in the house ,  and my mot her ki nd of
 gave him instructions in case 
-- the fear was already ther e that  
we will be taken away.  We  will forc
ed out of our house.  Th
at we will be forced 
to leave.  Wh ere?  
Nobody kne w.

But  my mot her felt  at the 
ti me that she needs to prep
are my brot her , be ca use i f
 she 's out in t he stre et  
and s o met hi ng happens, then s he gave hi m i ns t
ructi ons how to dres s me , how many la yer s of  
clothi ng to put on me .  
I kno w that there was knapsack for each 
one  of us  pre pare d on the side t o  
take wit h us, the necessit ies, chan
ges of a fe w pie ces of cl othi ng, 
and ea ti ng utensils ma de out o f  
somet hing unbre aka ble .  You know
, one of thos e ena me l  di shes , a nd t h e eating ut e nsils t hat we  
have to eat with and things like 
that were in the knaps
ack.  And my mother 
put in -- I had a littl e 
baby umbrella.  It wa s just like
 a lit tle umbrella  wit h pi nk r oses on it, a nd s he put t hat in t h e  
kna psa ck, too.  It was my fa vorite lit tle toy or wh
atever, and she put that  in.  And as she feared, 
that 's exactl y  what happened.  Be
cause she was out in the street wh
en t hey started r ounding up all  
the Je ws, a n d she ha d to beg for t he m  to allow fo
r  her to come  home bec a
use she ha d t wo chil dre n  
at ho me.  She came back and all 
we did i s pi ck up the  knapsa ck
s, and she took down t he Mezuzah  
fr om the door.  Sh e threw 
away the casing;  she j ust  kept the co
ntent, whic h wa s a l eat her  parc hme nt  
about this size.  Very long
.  This is all.  She took
 it wit h her .  Al ready pri o
r t o that , s he fl ushed down  
her diamond in the toilet,
 beca use s he  felt she 's not givi ng it t o  
anyone but she didn't want it to be  
take n a w ay from her .  And on a nice
 Ap ril day, they came  for us.   

Q: And  th is wa s wh at ye ar?  

A: 1944.   

Q: Well , be fore we move  furt her on, you sai d that
 your father had bee n take n to a labor ca mp.  How 
did that come about? 

A: They j ust  si mp ly announced it 's
 almost like it was conscription to 
the army, that you have to go.  

The r e was no if, buts , a nd in bet we en about it .  
The y just r ounde d up a ll the men, and t his was  
forced l abor camp.  They were not
 compensated for it .  
The y wer e not  pai d.  The y ma de t he m wor k, 
and t hey gave the m mini mu m food a nd s helter .  
And my fat h er wa s take n awa y in '43, and durin g  

that ti me he ca me ho me t wic e for 
a couple of hours, a couple of days
.  I don't recall .  And that wa s  
it.

I remember him on
e Passover sitting around the table in th
e kitchen and doing 
the traditional Seder 
and with the big, white pillow, a
nd my father had some white coat 
on that was the tradition that the 
fat her  of the  house hol d wore a ll whit e  duri ng Pass
over .  And t hen rea ding 
the Ha ggada h a nd doi ng  
this modest Seder, and the sirens
 started wailing.  And at that time
, already the bunker was dug up in  
the fr ont yar d in t he c our tyard, a nd al l the neig
hbors a nd us were runni ng
, we we re running down 
there for shelter.  That ki nd of 
sta nd s  up i n my me mo ry .  I re me mb
er my  fa ther c o min g ho me on e  
day, and I think that was 
wh en he ca me ho me fro m 
the one va cation that he had fr om a  labor c a mp . 
And I re me mber hi m ki nd of

Q: When you ment ion th
e men bei ng rounded up and you and 
your mother a nd brot her wer e 
rounde d up, wa s t his by t he Hungaria
n Poli ce or Ar my or do you know?  
A: It was the equi vale nt  in Hung
ary, there was a n equival ent  hooli ga n
 tr oops, j ust li ke the Na zis .  
They were called Arrocross (ph) . 
 And t hey were just a s bad, an
d j ust  as dasta r dl y, bast ardl y, 
wh atever you want to call 
them.  And they were just
 all too happy t o hel p.  The r e was no bi g qual ms  
about it.  They came, they rounde
d us up, the y put us on catt l e vans.  You know, li ke  a big va n,  
movi ng va n like you would 
s ee nowadays .  Wome n, chil dre n, olde
r people, they we
re put up on the  
van.  And I remember wa
lking out of the little apartment -- a
ll the apartment co
nsisted of was a 
kitchen and a bedroom.
  That's it.  And a little 
pantry.  And 
I remember the door cl
osing in and them 
boar ding it up.  Abs olut el y boardi ng it  up so no one 
can e nter .  And we wer e take n a wa y to a bri ck 
fa ctory in Kolozsvár.  The courty
ard of a brick factory, they put 
up little huts.  Four sticks of wood 
with a little fabric and so
me -- I don't even know
 what was on top.   
 

01: 27: 00 

 

And those were the li ving conditi on
s for the ne xt mont h for all  of 
t hes e pe ople, who for generati ons  
grew up i n Hungary.  Were born and raise d and worke d, and, of c
ours e, we live d in those hut s for a  
whole mont h.  Mini ma l  food was  brought
 i n.  I f it  rained, it  raine d.  I f i t  wa s dr y, it  wa s dr y.  I

remember my mother 
opening the little umbrella that she stuc
k in my backpack, 
and that was what 
was kept over my head when it ra
ined.  It was just horrendous conditions.  Horrendou
s conditions to 
see people who -- I was in my
 little eyes, in my lit
tle girl's eyes, just to see 
the doubts in most of the 
wome n a nd childr en bec ause most of
 the me n were gone .  Take n to
 the brickyar d factory.  We 
stayed t her e for a mont h, and fro m 
t he r e we  were  t ake n t o Budapest . 
Q: Let  me  just as k you . . . 
A: Yes .  

Q: . . . some  que stions  ab
out  thi s brickyard.  Wer e t here  any sani tation?  
A: Pro ba bly wh at was  th ere for  sa
nit ation was for those who worked 
at t h e bric kyard.  And I don't  
recall whether the y br ought a ny ot
her sanitati on in or how, and 
what happe ned, I  don't re call  
anymore. 

Q: Do you re me mber  wha t  you di d e ve r y 
day?   Did you play wit h other  ki ds?  
A: Pr obabl y played with other  ki ds
 in the courtyard, 
in the brickyard. 
Q: Was ther e any communica
tion with your fa ther? 
A: No.  At that point, my father
 was  in labor c a m p.  We  were take n 
a wa y.  I don't know i f t he ne ws  
arrive d that we were for ced a wa y. 
 I don't know what my fat her kn
ew.  I just know that when we 
wer e in Budapest , and we staye d 
in Buda pest for  two wee ks i n a la
rge school , we came away from 
Cluj, about  300 people , 300 J e wish
 people .  Tha t 's chil dre n, wome
n and some  men.  An d we were 
take n away t o Buda pest , and in Bu
da pest we wer e joine d wit h ab
out 1,500 other Hungaria n Je wis h  
fa milies.  I had an aunt in Buda
pest who disguised hers
elf as a Gentile.  She 
was blonde, blue-eyed, 
and s he was in one  of Ra oul  
Wallenberg's safe  houses.   
 

01: 30: 16 

 

She knew where my fat her was in l abor camp.  
She s muggl e d some bre a d to hi m, a nd the n we  
arrive d at  Budapest.  And those ar rive d, I  guess , my 
fat her l ear ned that  we ar
e there .  And he c a me , 
he was allowed a few hours to visit ,
 so he left and he came to vis
it us .  And I re me mb
er my mot her -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352

- and I ha d a n uncle wit h  us, his olde st br other , be
ggi ng hi m not t o ret urn, to 
sta y with us.  And he  
said he ca nnot do it , he has to go ba c k bec aus e i f 
he 's not goi ng to go bac k
, somebody else is going 
to get killed because he has not co
me back.  And that he
 cannot have on his co
nscience.  So they 
didn't ha ve t o worry muc h when 
they allowed somebody 
to leave for a few hours, because there was 
a threat provided with it, so that he
 knew that he has to come back.  
And if that was the last -- I don't 
even remember that episode so mu
ch.  I don't  re me mber se eing hi m, but I know he wa s there .  And  

that was t he  last --  i f I  ha ve see n
 hi m then, and I ' m sur e I  ha ve  -- tha t
 was the last that  I saw of him. 
And at t hat  ti me , I  was  cl ose  to bei ng -- 
cl ose  to si x.  Al most
 six years old.   
Q: And you were stayin
g in a school  . . . 
A: Yes .  

Q: . . . in Budapest?  

A: Eit her i n a school or t he main te mple, I ' m not
 positive now.  But it was a large, either a large  
synagogue or a large school.   

Q: You s aid you wer e t he re for . . . 

A: T w o we e ks.  

Q: Do you have any re me
mbrances of what this place was lik
e or what you we
re thinking or  
fe eling?   Do you have fo
od?  Who else was there? 
A: We were take n away from Ko lozs
vár together with my father 's ol
dest  br other , his  wi fe , his  son,  
and his  da ughter.  And a n other  sist er
 wh o wa s si n gle at  th
e time.  And we were 
all together, more or  
less.  So the onl y childre n that were familiar to me 
at  that  ti me were my cous
ins --  my c ousi n.  Now, 
she was t w o years older than me , a n d her brot he r wa
s t w o years ol der t h an my brot her.  So they 

wer e s equent i ally ol der t h an us  by t w o ye ars.   

 

01: 33: 01 

 

An d they're the only ones, I know 
that ther e are l ots of ot her ch
ildren, because th
er e was like 500  
orphan c hildren i n t his  group t hat wa s deported 
out of Bu dapest.  Bu t I 
don't reme mber, I think I  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352

clung ver y c l osel y to my mot her
.  There was too much 
chaos, too much fear
, and my mother wa s  
the barometer.  Li ke for 
all children, I think mother
s are the barometer .  You 
look at your mother 's  
fa ce, and i f s he 's s mili ng, th
en you'r e s mili ng.  And if s he 's a fr ai
d, then you'r e a fraid.  And I a m sure  
that a lot of things I have
 seen thr ough my mother 's 
eye s, or j ust  by l ooki ng at her  face .  A l ot of my  
fe elings were conn
ected to this.   
Q: Do you reme mb er what you sa
w or  what you we re fe eling?  
A: Probably just a lot of turmoil,
 a lot of unknown, a lot of fear 
of getting lost.  A lot of that  
instability, that lack of 
confidence of what will 
happen.  Where are we goi
ng?  Wh at's
 going to  
happe n t o us ?   That 
kind of a fe ar.   
Q: Ma ybe  what you l e ft behi nd?  
A: I don't even know if that
 en tere d my mi n d w h at we 
l e ft be hind.  It 's jus t , I 
think it's the fear of the 
unknown.  It 's the worry a
bout what wi ll ha ppen.   
Q: Was there any communicatio
n with your grandparents? 
A: No. 

Q: You just lost touch? 

A: Completely.  We didn'
t know what happened to 
our grandparents 
until after the war.  Wh en the  
war e nde d a nd pe opl e st arted looki ng for eac h ot her, 
t hat 's when we found out
 who is alive and who 
is dead, and who we
nt  ba ck t o Hungar y a nd who di d not .  
Q: Were you -- maybe not -- I don't 
know -- at the time, were you aw
are that this tr
ansport from the 
brickyar d t o Buda pest  wa s rea lly 
a specially arranged  transport? 
A: I  di d not  know.  That  is s o met h
ing that I lear ned about  
it later.  I just late
r on l ear ned that  thi s  
was a speci al group, so to sp
eak.  A pri vile ged gr oup, t hat wa
s gat here d together, a nd t hey  
supposedly -- this is some
thing t hat I  learne d l ater on.  Tha t  I ha
d no knowl edge of at 
all.  That this 
group was gathere d toget her, a nd t he y  collect ed 
e v erybody's be longings a nd mo ne y and j ewe lry a nd 

whatever everybody coul
d offer , beca use  the  Ger ma ns  ne ede d  truc ks .

And Ka stne r, who wa s a lawyer
, a Hungaria n J ewi sh la wye r , de
a lt wi th Eichma nn and plea ded 
wit h hi m t o  sa ve t his  group of J e ws to s how t o
 t he world that  what t hey are doi ng is not  --  
supposedl y not ha ppe ni ng.  And be
cause it was towards the end of 
the war, they 
were in such 
terrible need of money t hat they
 had accept ed it .  And this group 
supposedly was 
supposed to be 
transported to Turkey
.  But instead fr
om Budapest in cattle 
cars, they took us to
 Bergen-Belsen.   
Q: Do you know how you beca
me  a  part of t his gr oup?  

A: Pr obabl y beca use t w ofold.  First , my pare nts 
wer e always  Zioni sts , and they wer e always a ctive  
in the Zionist movement. 
 Second, my uncle who wa s with us, 
he was a very important banker in 
Kol oz s vár .  He  was  weal thy , a nd  he  wa s well-t o-
do.  And he  had mor e c o nne ctions, a nd he  put us  
on the li st, together wit h his fa mi ly.  And I thi nk th
at wa s probably one of th
e mo st importa
nt things.  
But in this group, as I said before, not everyone
 ha d a  connecti on, a nd not 
everyone wa s wealthy, it 
ma y see m.  The r e was a  good perc e ntage of the m 
who had the money, but 
the y br ought toge the r  
wit h the m 500 orpha n c hildre n w
ho did not  ha ve  anybody
 to speak for t h em. 
 And so there  were  
ma ny other people i n the  group, not j ust t hos e who we re privi l ege d to be i n  the group.  And i n those 

days also, there were ma ny moveme
nts.  There were many organizat
ions, Jewi sh orga
nizations, that 
tried to save Jews in ev
e r y whi ch wa y they could.  And li ke 
bet ween all  people, there are always 
di ffere nce s of opi nion.  The r e were thos e who fe
lt you s hould not de al wit h Na zis.  There wer e  
thos e who fe lt you s hould do whate ver  you ca n to s ave 
the J e ws .  There wer e  those who felt that just  
something bad will come  
out of it.  There were thos
e who felt that this is not
 the way to go.  So even 
if they kne w and the y coul d go on with the gr oup, 
the y di d not want t o.  It was a  life that wa s 
unknown.  J ust like Kas t ne
r thought  that we wil l  all wi nd up
 in Tur key, and we wound up in 
concentr ation camps inst ead
.  And he hi msel f, I think, put hi
s life on t he line every minute of the  
day when he  entere d this  negoti ations  and travele d
 as a Jew all over the c
ountry for meetings an d 
di ffere nt thi ngs .  Hi s li fe wa s on 
the line constantly.  His fa mily wa
s just in as much jeopardy as 
anybody else.

And, you know, people c l ai m he s hould ha ve t old ev
er ybody what 's going on.  He s houl d ha ve let  
the Hungarian Jewry know what's
 goi ng on.  The  doc ume ntati on s
hows  that there  are  s o me pe ople  
that esc ape d conce ntrati on ca mps who ca me ba
ck, a nd who reporte d what 's goi ng on, who tol d  
the m what 's goi ng on.  And nobody 
woul d bel i e ve the m.  Nobody wo
ul d liste n.  It 's  easy to be a 
good judge , you know, 
after the fact.   
Q: Now, you starte d to t alk abou
t how you we nt as a gr
oup in cattle car s, you we
re se nt to Ber gen-
Belsen. 

A: Ri gh t.  

Q: A c ouple  que stions:   Did e ver ybo
dy from this school or te mple in 
Buda pe st go on this trans port?  
A: Yes , yes .  Ever ybody t hat was ga
t h ered there went on the tr ansport. 
Q: When was thi s, appr oxi matel y? 

A: I tell  you, about  June .  The be
ginni ng of June a nd of Ma y, begi nni
ng of June , I would t hink, of  
1944. 

Q: Tell me a little bit 
about the journey.  Your
 fa mily all went togeth
er except  for . . . 
A: I don't re me mber a nybody but my
 mother and brot her wit h me .  I '
m sur e  that my 
uncle and aunt 
wer e there , but I was a war e onl y of the m.  It was terribl y cr owde d.  The r e wer e no s eats.  People  

wer e sta ndi ng, hoar de d i n.  The on
ly thing you could do i s
 st oop down.  There 
wa s no room in the 
train.  And t hey had a pa il, li ke  
what  you wa sh th
e floor with.   
 

01: 41: 04 

 

That was the sanitati
on, that was t he  bat hroom.  And i t  wa s 
t erribl y st i fli ng hot.  Catt le car s ha ve  
small windows.  It was just ho
rrendous, and I don't reme mb er ho
w long it t ook, how ma ny hour s we 
rode  in that.

Q: Do you have any re me
mbrance of what the m
ood wa s?   People thought the y were goi ng t o  
Tur key?  Di d t hey have expectati ons 
what t hings  wer e goi ng t o be . . . 
A: I  ha ve  the  feeli ng by t he ti me  th
ey wer e hoar ded int o t he cat tle car s,
 that  they fear ed t he worst.  I  
don't know wha t  the y  thought r e ally, beca us e 
I was so young at t he ti me tha t  even i f t h e 
conversation was going on around me
, I think my mi nd was worki ng in 
a different direction.  Either  
in denial of wh at wa s going on
, or  my mi nd went t hrough i ma gin
ation, you know, what a  c hild 
i magines or plays in t heir  head.  It 's very har d to t e
ll; I don't recall back that fa
r as to what  I had.  O n  
top of it, dur i ng thi s jour ney I ca me down wit h Ge
r ma n measl e s, so I wa s one sick c hild by the ti me  
I arrived to Bergen-Belsen.  And my
 mother wrapped me up
 in a blanket that 
she had fo r me , a littl e 
pink and white bla nket.  And s he c a
rr ied me wit h that bl anket;  I wa
s very small, lu
ckily.  Not that  
my  mot her  wa s tall , 
beli eve me.  But I was a small chi ld, an
d she picked me up i n her ar ms and 
covered me totally with a blanket.
  And by the  ti me  we got  to t h
e gate and there was a walking, 
mar chi ng fr om the train t o the ga
tes of hell of Bergen-Belsen, and 
I reme mber -- I don't  reme mber. 
This is just stories that I remember
 t ha t  my  mot her  wa s te
lling me.  That 
they asked her 
if I am sick, 
and she sai d , " No, the child is onl y sl eepi ng."  Th
ey c oul dn't gauge how ol d I was , be c ause I was  
small.  Being totally covered, they couldn't gauge my
 a ge .  And at that poi nt as soon as  we arrive d  
to Bergen- B elsen, t hey s eparat ed t he  boys a nd 
the me n fr om the women a
nd t he girls .  So my 
brot her was separ a te d fr om us at t h
at poi nt, and he  was ta ken --  he wa
s 14 years ol d at that ti me .  He  
wa s sepa rate d, he was wi th my unc le and hi s cous i
n.  And I was wit h my mo
ther a nd my a unt a nd  
my c ousin, t wo a unt s a n d a  c ousi n.  We  wer e i n
 these huge barracks with
 t he wooden beds .

Eve r ybody s l eepi ng ne xt  to e ver yb

wir es all over the place.  No 
sooner  di d we  arri ve, I  thi nk we
 neede d t o ma rch out  of t he ba
rracks to be coun

counting we nt on day, noon and ni ght
.  They were very metic ul ous , t hey
 constantly coun

know why i t  wa s so i m porta nt for 
t he m, but I gue ss they wa nte d to
 make sure that no one is 
mis sing.  And t he war we nt on. 
Q: Were  you abl e t o s ee  your  br other a nd your  uncl e . . . 

A: No, no.  Not ev
e n t hr ough the  bar bed wires .   
Q: Wer e you mi xed wit h prisoner s who ha d -- who were
 al rea d y there , or were you ke pt toget her a s  
a gr oup from your  tra nsport? 

A: I don't know.  Ho nestly, I do
 not know.  Maybe we
 wer e t ogether  as  a  gr oup, I 'm not sure . 
Q: Di d the y give  you we ar uni f or
ms  or you wore your own cl othe s?  
A: No.  Everybody wore 
what ever  was on hi m.  I don't  re
me mb er -- I don't remember given 
uni for ms .  

Q: Do you rememb
er what the conditions of
 life were like there?  
A: The conditions of life were ho
rrendous.  I reme
mber as a child they ha
d what you s
ee today, an 
out house .  You know, how you have 
an outhouse and t here i s l i ke a hole a n d ever yt hing goes i n the 
hole?  I r e member like 
a semicir cle, and these holes were 
ther e i n the ground wit hout any 
separ ation.  Wit hout any doors , wit h out any privacy. 
 Just like ani mal s.  And for some rea son, I  

recall being there.  It is so horrendous.  I was br
ought up i n s uch a mode s t
 wa y.  My pare nts were  
such modest people, and I had ne
ver seen adults sitting on a toile
t or doing their thing.  And I 
reme mb er somebody either bending down  and his 
glasses fell off t heir eyes.  I re member t hose 

glass es falli ng into t he hole.  An
d, you know, that wa s the e nd of 
it.  Now, you know, i n any per son 
wh o -- this kind of stuck in my
 mind.  And just
 underst anding of what 
it means for someone who 
does not see to wear glasses and to
 lose them.  And my 
mother glasses since 
she was a little child , 
so I know that this -- I know 
t hat she cannot -- she cannot exi st wi
t hout he r glas ses ,
 you know.  So 
that t hought left such an i mpres
sion on me .  And t he other  bi g i m
pression wa s whe n we were t ake n 
to the showers.  We were taken to
 the  showe r s, and i f you ca n i ma g
ine a fe nce that is made out of 
wooden slat s that are very ti ghtl y
 attached t o each ot
her.  We  were walkin
g by this fence, and 
people were  screa ming.  And I re me mber as king
 my mothe r , " Why are  they scre a mi ng? "  My 
mother said to me, "Because they recognize names that were writte
n on the fe nce."  Now, nobody 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
17 
 
had pens or  penc ils wit h the m, but  people bent  
down and picked up a  piec
e of rock or chal k y  
substance that wa s on the ground. 
 And they smeared their names in 
t he fe n ce.  Or wrot e  do wn date s 
when they were there, 
in case somebody else w
ill come and recognize them. 
 It's that feeling or  
maybe that faith that knowing that
 you ma y be going to your death,
 that ma ybe s o mebody else will  
come a nd re cognize your na me .  
Because the entire fence was scri
bbl ed wit h na me s, and peopl e  
obviously re cognize d s o me  na me s 
on those fences.  Or they didn'
t recognize, maybe
 they thought  
they did.  You never know what we
nt on in pe ople 's minds , but t h
e fe ar wa s tre me ndous .  And we 
wer e take n into the showers where e v erybody ha d to get undre ssed.  And I re me mber the horr or for  
the fi rst ti me in my life
, that  I ha ve seen a dult s naked.  I  
di dn't e ve n s e e childre n nake d.  I don't 
remember if I saw 
myself naked.  
I was just a little gi
rl, and now I see child
ren and mothers and  
grandmot her s ma rchi ng around naked into t hese show
ers.  And people were 
screami ng because they 
obviously di d not t hink t hat
 those we re showere d.  Obviousl y felt th
at this i s the e nd of t he m, but we  
wer e shower ed.  And we  ca me out of it, which i s so
 unbelievable that -- that
 that i mpr e ssion, t hat 
horre ndous t hing, it  sta ys  like a  pic t
ur e in your mi nd fore ve
r.   An d t h en  we  we
r e ta ken bac k.  And 
the other , of course, the counting 
that I already told you about, th
at t he y mar c he d us out fr om t he 
barra cks  c onstantl y t o sta nd in line s
 a nd count  us, stand i n r o ws.   
 

01: 50: 01 

 

And the ot he r horre ndous  i mpr essi
on wa s when they ca me wit h th
eir leat her boot s and the Ger man  
She pherds wit h the m.  And bri ngi
ng the food, whi ch al ways looked
 to me like some kind of a 
dishwater with something fl oating 
in it that looked like some bu
rgundy sausage or some thing. 
Some thing disgusting looking in it.
  That was the fo od
, and a little bit of br
ead.  I don't know, I 
really honest ly I don't know how we survi ve d. 
 I really do n ot  kno w ho w we s urv ive d.   Ho w we  
survived the hunger, 
how we s urvived t he  condi tions .  It 's li ke
 it 's  ha rd, it 's a m
azi ng.  I remember 
also bei ng marche d out  of  Bergen- Bel s en 
about  eight mont hs  a ft er being t her e.

even know.   
Q: Do you know if there wa s an
y awareness of the Sa bbath or of
 any holidays dur

A: I don't believe so.  I don't be
lieve so.  Maybe quietl y my mother
 sang some thing to
 me .  I don't  
eve n know what da y wa s 
following wh at day.   
01: 53: 12 

 

There was such a loss 
of time .  I don't know whet
her they knew reall y what

Q: Anythi ng else you ca

Are there i mpressions,

healt hy wei ght .  Eve ryone waiting around to die,
 ba sicall y.  I don't t hink at t hat  poi nt a nyone  
thought that we'll surv
ive or that we will co
me out of it alive. 
Q: That was the feeli ng? 
A: I am sure.  I 
am sure that no one 
believed that we will 
ever come out of Berg
en-Belsen alive.   
Q: Oka y.  So you were  st arting t o 
s ay that about  ei ght  months l ater. 
A: Ei ght months la ter, we wer e ma
rched out of the camp all of a su
dden.  I gue ss the de al wa s made .  
And the pa yme nt, t he fi nal pa yme n
t to the Germans was 
paid, I t hink, as we
 entered the Swiss 
bor ders in Switz erla nd.  And we wer e marc he d out 
of ca mp, and I re me mber 
that we wer e ma rch e d 
out by fours ,  whi c h me ans they 
were mar chi ng i n groups of four
s.  And s o me body i n fr ont , maybe  
there was a row that t her e were li
ke  t hree pe ople .   So t his Na zi 
ba star d wi th hi s dog was st anding 
there , and pulled s o me body for war
d.  And from ever y line , he 
pulle d some body for war d.  So you 
wer e feeli ng that missi ng per son.  That ha ppe
ned in t he fr ont .  And I  was on t he  edge , a nd I  
remember pulling my 
arm fr om my mother's ar
m and pushing me forward, 
one line forward.  I was 
horrifi ed; I was a little girl
.  I was not next to my mother.  An
d with the force th
at he flung me 
forward, I started crying. 
 And it took a while fo r 
us to walk away a littl
e bit before my mother  
asked the person next t o her t o swi t ch pl aces wit h
 me so that she can have
 me next to her .  I  
remember that horrifi
ed mo ment.  You know, you 
lose all the confidence --
 the little confidence that 
you still have wit hin you, you lose 
it beca use you are just t hr o wn i n
 fr ont of your mot her.  But it 
wa s done i n suc h a  br utal  way that 
it totally shook me
 up as a child. 
Q: Did t hey tell you why you wer e be ing marc he d 
out of the c a mp or wher
e you we re going to, do 
you . . . 

A: Not me .  I don 't k no w  wh at the y
 t old my mother or wher e t hey 
ar e taki ng us .  I don't  know t hat  
she knew.  I don't know t hat they tal k ed about .  We 
were just all marched out 
of the camp.  We wer e  
take n out . 

Q: Di d the  boys  joi n you?  
 Di d you se e your  br ot her?  
A: Yes,  y e s.   T he me n , th e b oys  wh o wer e  t here , 
they joined us.  I didn't 
se e my  -- I  d on 't re me mbe r  
seeing my br other  until
 we got to Switzerla

Q: And some of them you hadn't

A: We were in different  barracks. 
 Some of us were in the same

Q: Let 's pic k  up.  You were mar che d out  of the  
c a mp.  You wer e te mpor ar
ily separated fr om your 
mother , and then I guess she joi ned
 you in line .  Then wha t do you
 reme mb er happening after that? 
A: I re me mber bei ng put on trai ns
, a nor mal t r ain.  And ridi ng and 
ar rivi ng in Switz erla nd.  And I  
remember -- really, th
e fact that we crossed the border , that di
dn't not affect -- I 
don't recall that at 
all. 
Q: You can't  recal l t he r ide? 

A: I  don't r ecall the ri de.  What I do
 r e member  is ar riving t o a pl ace t h
at looked li ke a pal ace.  I n my  
child's eye, I th
ought  that we had a
rrived to the biggest pal ace, al
most like i n a 
dream.  And I  
remember coming t here, and the ch
il dren were  gi ven toys by t he 
Re d Cr os s and bei ng f e d a nd be ing 
take n car e of.  And the na me of 
the place was called Hotel Esplan
ade .  And very s hortl y a ft er  
arrivi ng and probabl y bei ng checked
 physical ly a nd medi call y  and che c
ki ng for lice and checking to 

see i f everybody who needs 
me dica l a ttenti on and so forth, ver y 
s hortl y a ft erwards , t he y took all t he  
childr en a wa y.  And we wer e brought to a -- up in 
the Al ps, you know, like  in
to like a far m ar ea for  

recuperation.  And just to get us a little bit health
ier after all the ordeal of being in concentration 
ca mp for so long.  At this point the Re d Cross wa
s there to help.  The Schlakim (ph) , which are 
me sse ngers from Isr ael, 
from Palestine at the 
time came to our aid.  They were working very hard 
on recei ving the pr oper certifi cates
 to enter Palestine, 
beca use we could not e n
ter freely.  And some 
semblance of normal life wa
nted t o r eturn.  Now, that 's what t h
ey wa nte d t o achi eve .  So the y took 
us int o a -- as I said, it was proba bly l i ke a far m. 
 Al most like a kibbutz ki nd
 of a thing on the Al ps. 
And they st a r ted pr oce ss ,  they s t ar
te d to try t o teac h us a ccordi ng to
 the level that we were at, what 
we  were  suppose d t o st art.  An
d I  don't  even r e me mbe r  --  pr oba
bly they tried to teach us in 
Hungaria n, i f I '

Now, in Switzerland we a
ll learned a little bit of Ge
rman because that was th
e spoken language in 
that ar ea of the country. 
 And eac h and one of us 
kind of picked up some
 Ger ma n langua ge.  I 
remember sitting in th
e classr oom, it wa s very fri ghte ning to 
me to s o me exte nt 
because here I was 
awa y fr o m my  mot her .  My mo th er wa s le ft i n t h
is big hot el  wit h a l ot 
of other women who wer e 
widowed, and all the children in a
ll ages were gathered together.  
And tea c hers were br ought from 
all over to try to teach us, and they tried to cond
uc t classe s.  And I just 
remember me sitting in the 
classr oom a nd t otall y ga zing and no
t  comprehending a nyt hi ng.  It wa
s  like  in a drea m,  I re me mb er  
sitting there saying to myself that
 "This is school
," but my mind wa
s totally on other 
things.  I could 
not concentr ate.  I don't r e member
 that -- I can't recall if I learne
d anythi ng.  I pr
o bab ly  re me mb e r  
just learning just a little 
bit of the ABCs, the letteri
ng, the beginning of learni
ng how to read.  But to  
tell you that this was a for mal sc
hooli ng t hat I could recal l or I  can
 ret ain anyt hing, probabl y very  
little because of the emo tional upheav
al that probably I fe
lt as a child.  The on
e thing for sure that 
none of us got wa s psychological c
ounseli ng.  That was  not i n  anybo
dy's agenda or even in their - - 
in anybody's thought that 
that was needed at the time.  I reme
mber the older children putting up a 
play of Da vi d a nd Golia t h.  I re me
mber my brot her pla ying t he r ole  
of Goliath if I'm -- of David. 
And - -  but  I  don't re me mber
 anythi ng else fr om area
, j ust  the fact  that t h
ere was a l ot of cheese,  
whi c h I hate d.  The r e wa s a lot of 
mil k, which I di dn't like to drink.
  M ost peopl e were s o ha ppy s o  
see cheese.  As a child, t hese wer e things t hat I di
d not li ke to eat.  I did not like che ese , and I didn't 
like har d-boi led eggs, you know.  I 
used to chok e on  them.  There 
are memories of t hings t hat  I  
really c oul d not  -- I  gues s  I c oul d not  t olerat e t he m.   
 

 

02: 07: 02 

 

And ot her t han t hat , rea lly the ti me  in Switz er
l and pas sed by, and be fore we kne w it -- I al s o  

re me mb er s o met hin g t hat  really  st
ayed with me , is the fact that 
the Swiss people did not look upon 
us kindly.  They were  not  friendl y. 
 They reall y di d not l i ke  for eigne
rs, and they -- I'm sure t hat  thi s

wa s very har d for  the m t o ge t thi s many re fugee s  
in one of their hotels.  
An d fr o m t h ere we we re  
take n away.  I don't  know what mode of tra ns por ta
tion, in all honest y.  Pr oba bly by tr ain aga i n to  
Bari , It aly, and from Bari , Ital y we 
we re ta ken by a  boat t o I srae l. 
Q: Oka y.  I  wa nt t o j ust
 stop you fo r a minute. 
A: Yes .  
Q: To see i f you ca n reca ll anyt hi
ng e l se about  Switzerla nd.  I appr eci
at e that your mi
nd wa s not o n  
your cl ass es . . . 

A: Um-hum. 

Q: . . . at thi s far m s chool or what eve r , but do 
you have any re me mbra nce of what kind of cla sse s? 
Did t he y give you a ny r el i gious cla sse s, any ki nd of
 cla sse s that  mi ght hel p you pre pare for livi ng in  
Palestine? 

A: Probably.  I don't r eall y recal l.  I r e call ot her t h
i ngs t hat wer e ver y i mpo
r t ant. You know, in every 
classr oom, t here are chil dren who 
ar e the bulli es?  In ever y classr oo
m that there is the girl who is 
the queen and it 's amazing.  I re
me mber bei ng afr a id of s o me of 
t he ki ds bec aus e they were s o  
de ma ndi ng and being a fraid e motionally from t h e m. 
 I was a very sensi tiv
e child.  Interestingly 
enough, I gr ew in to be quite a str ong adult , and 
even as a youngster li fe 
kind of prepared me to 
bec o me qui t e a strong indivi dual .  But I re me mber  the sensi tivi t y of bei ng e asily hurt.  I had a lot of  

worries for a six-year-ol d  child.  
I had to worry that I'm al one.  
I had to worry that some body will  
de ma nd thi n gs of me  t hat  I 
won't be able 
to give.   
 

02: 10: 02 

 

I had to wor r y about my safety.  I had to worry a
bout my exi stenc e.  I ha
d to worry where are we 
going?  Wh ere is going 
to be home?  I had to wo
rry if my father will come
 back.  A lot of tho s e 
things ar e c onst antl y on my mind, 
a nd s chool was the farthe st thin
g fr om my  mind.  I was really 
mo re concerned of how to 
survive in this kind of 
a jungle.  I'm sure they 
prepared us.  As  I said, 
they had put up a play of
 David and Goliath, so obv
iously the themes of tr
adition and the themes of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
24 
 
Israel a nd t h e the me s of the Bible wer e br ought 
back t oget her.  And don'
t forget a lot of these  
childr en have studied alr eady in 
Hungary, and a lot of them we nt
 to t he He bre w Gy mn asi u ms or  
we nt t o othe r Hebr e w s c hools.  
They ha d bac kgr ounds . 
 M y brot her kne w ho
w to speak Hebrew 
already.  Not fluentl y, but he stud
ied He bre w.  So he kne w how to rea d and he kne w how t o writ e  
and he kne w how t o spea k.  I didn't know one wor d at
 that poi nt.  I was too young.  I didn't ha ve that  
in my bac kground yet .   
Q: Wh en you say that you had so
 much on your mi nd as a small ch
ild, were there things that you 
re me mber doing t o prot e ct y
our sel f or to just get by?  
A: I reme mber havi
ng to worry about 
what will I give to th
is girl that I will liv
e in peace?  I don't 
even reme mber who she was.
  But , you know, that 
conce r n, what c oul d I  gi
ve her or what c oul d I  
make for her or whatever 
from the little that I knew 
how to make or give or
 whatever -- 
what did I  
have?  But I had a lot 
of worries like t hat for my 
little survival.  And I was ve
ry little physically, too .   
Not just age-wise, I wasvery little physically. 

Q: But you had other stre ngt hs?  

A: Obvi ousl y.  That 's  ver y
 -- that 's  for sure.   
 

02: 13: 03 

 

Q: It must  ha ve bee n quit e 
ni ce t o see  your brot her  agai n?  
A: Ye s.  But  you ha ve t o  unders
tand that the relationship between
 me  and my br ot
her wa s not the 
sa me a s si bli ngs .  I  woul d ne ver  go
 t o my br othe r  if I had a pr oble m. 
 Or  i f  I ha d a  fear , I could not 
talk to my brother at that age. 
 For me , he l oomed la rg
er than life .  He wa
s a symb ol, unti l  I got  
married.  It's not just as a little 
child, a six-year-old chil
d, there was this age di
fference between us. 
We  lived together for a ve
ry short per iod in our li
ves, and t he n we  ne ver  liv
ed together again.   
Q: Just maybe because he 
was al so at  this far m, y
ou felt a little bit 
more pr otecte d si nc e  your mother  
wasn't t here?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
25 
 
A: I don't thi nk s o.  Bec a use he wa
s busy with his age group.  He 
wa s busy with his own sur vival. 
He had his friends from school .  
It was di fferent , and I don't know
, he l oved me very much, but I  
don't  thi nk that he underst ood 
or t hat I underst ood what I  n
eede d or what he  nee ded.   
Q: No w . . .  
A: We we re never taught  as chil
dren to communi c ate ver ball y and 
t o expre ss our e moti ons a nd our  
fe elings or t o speak up a bout the m
.  Thi s is all many, ma ny, ma ny 
year s l ater, you know, that one  
learns t hrough li fe  t o s pea k up. 

Q: Whil e you wer e at  thi s fa
rm, did you mother come and 
s ee you fr om ti me  to ti me?  
A: I don't re me mber that .  No, we as  kids I gue ss
 we we re ta ken back to the hot el eve r y onc e in a  
while.  I don't reme
mber my mother vis
iting.  That I don't 
remember at all. 
Q: But you did go to the  hotel?  

A: I think we went to th
e hotel and we saw them.  
It  was n 't  suc h a big dista nce , but  it 's  a ver y bi g 
distance if you don't have 
with what to go.  But I th
ink e ver y once i n a whil e,
 we  were  t a ke n b a ck  to  
visit .  

Q: Di d you ma ke  frie nds  ther e?  

A: I don't reme mb er. 

Q: No w,  wer e  y ou  a war e th
at ultimate plan here wa
s to get to Palestine? 
 

02: 15: 51 

 

A: My mot h er -- you know
, honest ly, my mother  wa
nte d t o go bac k t o Hu
ngary to look for the 
fami ly, to l o ok for her fat her
 -- for my  father.  
To see i f he is ali ve, and 
my uncle said no.  My uncle 
wa s the ol de st aut hority, and he sai d, "There i s not hin
g to go back for.
  Hungary's finish
ed.  It's done  
wit h.  We  ar e goi ng t o Palesti ne, a
n d  wh en we ge t there , we 'll  loo k 
for them.  And if they're alive, 
they'll come out .  And i f they ar e not
, we are not going back there.  That 's it .  Ther e is nothi ng to g o  
back for."  Luckil y, my 
mother listened, and so 
we went to Palestine. 
Q: How long do you think 
you were in 
Switzerl and? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
26 
 
A: Eight mo nths.  It took a long 
time for them to be 
a ble t o obtai n t he pr oper  certi fic ates t o e nter  
Israel .   
Q: Was ther e any consci ousness 
of t h e war  ending in Europe  wh
ile you were in Switzerland?  
A: I am sure.   

Q: But not for you?  

A: Not for me.  I j ust  re
member  one t h ing in Swit zerland t hat 
was amazing.  You 
know, wh en I said 
to you that a chil d al ways gauges
 their mo od according to her mo th
er?   A n d I r e me mb e r  in a cr o wd  
standing outside, it wa s like on the top of the st
air s.  My mother was sta
nding, and I was sta ndi ng  
next  to her .  The y we re li steni ng to ne ws  on t h
e r a dio out  loud, and e ver y
body starte d cr ying.  And 
my  mo ther wa s crying, and, of co
ur se, I i mmedi ately start ed crying 
bec ause a s s oon a s s he crie d, I 
cried.  What happened?  Wh at 
happened?  What happened?  A
nd my mot her te
lling me that 
Presi de nt Roose velt died.  I di dn't
 know wh o Pr esident Ro os
evelt was.  But the 
ne ws that he died  
created such a sorrow in everyb
ody, if they would have only 
known how little he has done, i f  
anyt hing at a ll, t o save t h e m.  But  e ve r ybody 
wa s so sur e t hen that he  was doing his ut most. 
Q: I s t here  a nyt hing el se that yo
u c an recall about  t hos e ei ght  mont hs
 i n Swi t zerla nd?   Or  who took 
care of you? 

A: No.  I don't e ven re me mber wh
o took of us .  I 'm s ure ther e wa s 
some ol der indivi duals who took  
care of us.  I  don't  even 
r e me mbe r  s o mu ch  the  ro o m or  the  b e
d whe r e we  wer e .  It wa s de finitel y  
1,000 perce nt i mprove ment over Be
r gen- B elsen, and it t o
ok me  ma ny, many ye
ars to go back t o  
Switzerland.   

 

02: 19: 04 

 

And I  visite d wit h my husb
and Switzerland, and we we
re in Montreuil, I said
 to him, "I think the 
hotel is supposed to be in th
is area."  And I sai
d, "I wonder if this hotel still
 exists, and if it exists, is  
it big or is it small?"  Because
, you know, whe n you l ook a s a 
child, some thing 
looks humongous 
and you don't reme mber.  Well, I cal
l ed my brot her in Isra el a nd as
ked hi m, a nd he  sa id, " Yes , i n  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
27 
 
Köln (ph) above Montreuil is Hotel 
Esplanade.  It still exists.  You 
go out there."  Well, we took t h e 
train, which is like 
a Ve nicula ( ph), it 's al most li ke  a mount
ain- cli mbi ng tr ai n.  And I ca nnot t ell you  
-- I just sat t here a nd cri ed.  I ca n't e xplai n the e motions .  I didn't wa y one wor d, but  as the trai n 
cli mbe d hi gher a nd hi gher, t he te ars just r olle d down
 my e ye s.  And whe n I 
got to the hotel, whe n  
we finally got t here, i ndeed, t he 
hot e l  was a huge  hot el.  A ve ry el
aborate  hotel , it 's  not a wonder  
that in my eyes it looked like a pa
lace.  Because, as it tu
rns out, t he la dy who greete d us at  the pl ace , 
she sai d, " T his hot el was once upon a time the winter
 pla yground for all  the royalti e s of Eur ope . 
They used to come here for i
ce skating and for skiing 
and for all sports ac
tivities, winter sport 
activities."  And this was really 
li ke a palac e.  And she showed us
 a movi e about the history of t h e 
hotel .  She s ays , " You ar e not t he onl y re fuge es.  
There are many of them wh
o have  come bac k to  
visit t hrough the years."  It ceased t o exist as a ho

ri ng t he war t hey wanted t o tear  
it down bec a use nobody ca me
 t o t he hotel .  And t hen the y ke pt 
it as a refugee cent e
r.  The refugees 
that were br ought out of  the  war 
passed through this hot
el.  Now, they showed us this movie, and 
they showed also movi es about a
ll these royalties used 
to come and ice skate 
a nd ski  over i n this  
area.  And after the 
war ,  a fter t he r e fuge es have l e ft , a gai n 
t h ey wa nte d to tear down t he hotel  and 
they deci de d to ke ep it .  And now the y us e it fo

large, large hotel.  So it wasn't ju

 interesting to 
see.

Q: Now,  you were so
me how ta ke n t o Bari?  
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: Do you know how l
ong you were there befo
re  you got on a s hip?  
A: No. 

Q: Do you --  was  ther e 
a  l arge  gr oup wit h you?  
A: The  enti r e group, t he origi nal group, wer e all 
t ake n Bari.  Put on t his Via dol e (ph) , I thi nk was  
the name of the boat .  Vi ador an 
(ph), if i™m not mistak
en wa s the na me  of t hat boa t, a nd we wer e  
take n wit h this boat t o Pal estine .  It wa s not a luxur y boa t.  I don't e ven re me mber how ma ny days i t  

took us to sail fr om Bari to Is
rael, to Pal esti ne at the ti me.  
But when arrived to Palestine, I 
remember getting off the boat, and 
we were given some 
nuts and I think an or
ange.  My two hands 
fill ed up - -  one or ange fil l ed up 
t w o hands.  And I  re me mb
er t hat my br other, 
my  father's youngest  
brot her , he wa s only li ving rel ative who li ved i n Is
rael.  He left to Pale
stine whe n  he was ver y  
young, and he wa s t here  from
 the age of 19.  So  he 
had we nt in t he '30s  to 
Palestine wi th his wi fe. 
And he was like the welcomin
g committee.  But we were
 taken from there to Ac
lite (ph) , which is a 
Briti sh c onc entrati on c a mp kind of t hing, in Pal e stin
e it sel f.  I n Aclite (ph)  you wer e di sinfected a nd 
chec ke d for healt h, for t h is, for ot her r easons .  And we
 were the first ali a (ph) after the war to arrive  
to Palestine that had pe
rmits to enter.  I th
ink every boat after us 
were taken to Cyprus. 
Q: Wh at mo nth is this?  

A: This was in Se ptember. 
 So we we re --  Septe m ber 
3rd, 1945, to Israel.   
Q: The mood on th
e boat must have 
been pret ty good. 
 

02: 25: 00 

 

A: I am sure the m
ood was good.  The conditions
 on the boat were not go
od.  And I don't know how 
good t he  mood could ha ve be
en on t h e boat , because they wer e 
going t o a  place  that was unknown. 
They were going to a pla
ce that was not free.  Th
ey were going to a plac
e where it was under British 
mandate.  They knew darn well 
that the relationship 
bet wee n the Ara bs and J e ws was not good.

The y were hopi ng.  And don't for get  there were 
a lot of wome n wi thout  their husba nds wit h two 
children, three children.  Generally two or one, wh
o ca me  t oget her  with nothi ng.  The clot hes  o n  
their ba ck, no mone y, no hus ba nd, no
 prospects, no jobs, no profession. 
Q: Do you re me mber  your i mpr e
ssi ons when you got
 off the boat? 
A: My only i mpression wa s it  wa
s s unny.  I t  wa s a co
untr y full of li ght , you 
know.  And seei ng an 
orange made  a very bi g i mpres sion on me .  And i n 
a very short time after we
 were in Ac
lit e ( ph)  , 
we wer e dis perse d.  I wa s sent wit h three ot her c h ildre
n, gi ve or take one girl, a br othe r and a si ster . 
She's a year younger t han me; he
 is t wo ye ars ol der t han me .  
And a nother young 
boy.  We  were  
sent  to one kibbutz.  M y 
brot her was sent  to another ki bbutz .  My
 c ousin was s ent to a t hird ki bbutz.  
And her  br ot her was sent to t he fourth 
kibbutz .  So we  were  not toget her . 
Q: And your mother? 
A: A nd  my  mo ther  st aye d in  Hai f
a i n  a hotel  for women.  So this
 t i me we  wer e s epar at ed for good 
for a long ti me .  I was ta ken t o Halba , whic h is cl ose 
t o Jer usa le m.  My mo ther sta ye d i n Hai fa.  My 
brot her was take n to Ne va-Ta n (ph)
, and my t wo other cousi n s to th
e Fr ench ki bbutzi m.  And t hat  
was --  that was t he end of
 that .  And at  this  ti me  I  found my
s el f in a  ki bbutz , all by mys el f. 
Q: Were you scar ed?  

A: I ' m sure .  Ho w co mfor ta
ble could I have been?  At
 t his  point I was a l rea d y se ve n a nd a hal f years  
old.  Think of it, I wa s s eve n and 
a hal f years ol d, s o I mis se d firs
t grade;  I mi ssed 
second grade. 
And I just started first grad
e.  That was the first time
 tha t  I r e me mb er  g oi ng t o
 school  and starti ng t o 
learn how to read and wr
ite.  On top of it I arri
ve d to a kibbutz that no
body spoke  Hungari an.  I  
spoke very little German, and I de
fi nitely did not speak Hebrew.  
So the communi
cation was very 
di ffic ult, but  like all chil dren, you quickly le arn 
--  you quic kly learn a ne w language when you a r e  

forced to l e arn it .  But agai n, t he communicati on 
wit h my mo ther  an d fat h
er was very di fficult,  
beca use I di dn't know how t o rea d and writ e.  I 
just started to learn ho
w t o rea d and writ e in 
Hebrew.  My language skills
 could not have been
 great at that ti
me.  And like all first graders, yo u 
can i magine how well I wr ote and 
how ma ny s p elling mist akes.  My 
mother did not know how to 
read Hebrew, and I didn't -- I couldn't r
ead her  Hungarian l e
tters to me.

02: 29: 06 

 

And nobody coul d rea d the m to me either .  So it  
was ver y di ffi cult .  My brot her wrot e to me in 
He bre w, whi ch I c oul dn't  read eith
er.  But that could -- 
at le as t some body coul d re ad it .  So it 's a  
little bit comical, but it was a quite 
difficult communication. 
 And I didn't see my
 mother very often  
because t he circumstances in Israel
 were so difficult at
 that time .  These were the times of the 
upris ing, t his  was pre- Wa r of Inde
pendence.  Traveling was not easy.
  People traveled with ar mored 
vehi cles, and they traveled onl y in car avans.  You 
didn't se e a car riding free l y on the roa d, you were  
onl y safe i f you traveled in car avans and i n ar more
d ve hicle s.  So r eall y  
I think I saw my mother 

twice a year during this 
while peri od, a nd I wa s t h
er e for  t hree years.   
Q: Wh at wa s yo ur
 life  like then? 
A: The kibbutz li fe wa s oka y.  I  me
an I'm sure it wasn't 
e asy for me  e moti onall y, but it  was okay. 
There wa s a lot of -- I think I ca
n attribut e there was a lot of caring.  I think we  got some thing, 
some body c ared about  us.  I 
think we  got  that s ens e 
-- t hat sense di d come t h
rough.  I t hi nk goi ng to  
school e very day, a nd fr om ver y 
ear ly young age they tea ch you to
 wor k a little bit to keep you 
bus y, a nd t o kee p you a productive indivi dual .  It ke
pt us ver y bus y and ver y
 active and not all o win g  
too much, you know, for  day dre a mi ng.  And every chil d wa s assigne d
 to a fa mil y.  Unfort unately 

for me, I wa s assi gne d to the shoe ma ker in t he 
ki bbutz, who c a me from Pola
nd who wa s a wi dower ,  
and who had a daught er a  year ol der t han me .  So
 I was not ass i gne d to a fa mil y wher e t here wa s a 
mother  a nd a fat her .  I wa s a ssi gne d t o a  fa mil y 
t hat t her e wa s onl y a  father , a nd si nce  he  had a  
daught er who wa s a  year  ol der t ha n 
me , he just didn't know how to be
 a parent for bo
th of us.  He 
wa s a good ma n, but , you know, i f 
you ha ve a c h oice bet wee n your
 own daughter and somebody's 
else 's daught er, it 's a big di ffere nc e.  So, but t h
at  wa s th e wa y it was .  B u
t, generall y spea ki ng, I  
think there was lot of positive thin
gs in the kibbutz.  A lot of, you 
know, a lot of things that we re 
taught that were ver y pos i tive and ver y  nice, a nd 
the holidays were always cel
ebra ted in a very ni ce  
ma nner.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352

02: 32: 01 

 

This wa s not a re ligious kibbutz at  
all, but all the Bibli
cal holidays were cele
brated on -- i n a freer 
wa y.  That you felt -- 
I felt very much that I bel o
nged, so there was a l ot of
 caring.  I know I missed 
my  mo ther, I know I fa ntasiz
ed a l ot.  I fant asized a 
l ot about  my brot her , and 
that is strange, that's  
eve n more .  Bec a use her e  he wa s alre ady he we nt 
into the Na vy, and I alwa ys worrie d whether he is  
going to get killed or is he going to 
be alive.  And so my 
brother, again, loomed 
larger than life in 
my e yes  in t hos e days.  And I  se l
dom saw him,  very seldom.  So re
ally with the ex
ception of living 
toget her  in Hungary, we never  agai
n li ved toget her  in t he sa me  house . 
Q: We re there a lot of other children on this kib
butz who were ess enti al l y in your predica ment?  

Who had come  here, wh o had been 
separated from th
eir    . . . 
A: Yea h.  Yes.  In fa ct, t hat 's 
what I said to people, you know, at
 ti me s when the y as ke d me.  I was 
one of the fortunate one s, I ha d a 
br other; I ha d a mother.  My frie
nds, the t wo brot her a nd si ste r , 
they had a mother a nd they had eac h other .  Then
 the chi l dr en fr om Tehran came.  These were  
childr en fr om Russia and from Pol a nd, pri ma r il y Po
lis h chil dren, who c a me 
without  a soul.  The y  
lost t heir par ents .  The y l ost t heir si bl ings .  The y
 l ost t heir unc les, t heir gra ndpare nts , e veryt hing i n  

the war.  They were sole 
survivors.  So at th
at  ti me, as much as
 one want ed t o feel sor r y for onesel f ,  
I thi nk t her e wa s al wa ys  some body 
who was i n a  worse positi on t ha n
 we wer e .  An d t hese  ch ildre n  
came with no one, and the kibbut
z absorbed them
 into fa milies.  They
 became their families ,  
literally. 

Q: Were you consci ous of that  at  the 
time?  Wh at were 
you t hi nki ng about?  
A: I was ver y consci ous of it at the ti me .  I wa s al wa ys ve ry --   very, very s ensiti ve to ot her pe opl e 's 

fe elings  and other  c hildr e n's  feel in
gs as much as I  was sensiti ve to
 my  own.  I was very sensitive, 
very c aring, and I thi n k I also r ati onali zed it 
wa s a ver y  good way of 
pr otecti n g myse l f.  I 
rationalized, so -- there are peopl e t hat have l ess th
a n you, so it 's okay.  It was n 't the end of t h e  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352

world.  I think that 's what kept 
my sanity, that I was 
able al ways to see ma
ybe the better side o f 
things instead of 
the worst side.  
 
02: 35: 08 

 

I just feel I wa s ver y for t unat e 
as a c hild, be cause , in all hones t y, wh
en I think back t hat  none of u s  
ever , e ver  got a ny ps yc hol ogic al c o uns eling or help
 or  gr oup se ssi on or  -- it was n 't  eve n t alke d  

about.  Everybody just went about 
their lives going on, it really didn'
t come back to haunt me until I 
had children of my  own.  I 
didn't real ize the feeli ngs that  I st ored
 inside until I had my  own children.  
Because, you see, as I sa w them gr
owing up and I realized the ages, 
the cir cumstances, that 's when I  
had a difficult time to 
r econcile wit h what I we nt through. 
 Because you see your children, how 
vul nerable t h ey are at such a young 
age and how needy they ar e, it 's ve
ry ha rd.  On the other hand, it  
ma de me very strong.  It 
ma de  me abl e to sl ough 
off a lot  of thi ngs  a nd be  a ble t o face  li fe.   
Q: Di d you devel op close  rela
tionships in that kibbutz? 
A: I 'm s ure I  had friends .   How clos e relations hi
ps , not hing tha t  was over whel mingl y comfort able ,  
you know, i n  hi ndsi ght.   

Q: Di d you have  fun?  

A: I ha d a good ti me .  I had a pr etty good ti me .  I 
had a good ti me , but I think I ha d -- I was al so a  
very serious child.  I probably carri
ed a lot of worry on my little sh
oulders, I'm sure of that.  I 
remember I  al ways had a recurri ng
 night mar e.  It t urned out 
t hat  a s i ren wa s going on an d 
ever ybody was rushi ng for t he shel
t ers, and I couldn't run a n d I c oul
dn't wal k.  M y l egs woul dn't  
carry me .  And I wa s cra wli ng on all four in fr ont
 of the dini ng room, a nd ever ybody wa s pass ing 
me  by.   

 

02: 38: 04

And I jus t  --  my le gs we re paral yze d, I could 
not wal k.  So I know wher
e it comes fr om.  But for 
ma ny years  I  ha d t his  rec urring nigh
t mar e, same t hing all  over  again. 
Q: What do you t h
ink you wer e . . . 
A: It wa s my  fears of survival. 
Q: Do you think that yo
u generall y fel t  sa fe fi nall y in t his  ki bbut z?  
A: I felt sa fe , but I know that I also proba bly put
 up a good facade.  I re
me mber wh en  Israel w a s  
declar ed a fr ee state, we wer e slee
ping.  I must ha ve be
en -- 1948, I was 11 ye
a r s ol d.  And we wer e  
awakened, we were sleeping, we 
were awakened all to come ou
t and da nce , an
d e ve r ybody was  
very happy.  An d they announce
d at the sa me ti me that Hai f a was c onquer ed, a nd I be ca me 
hyst erical .  Bec ause I di d not unders tand that  it wa
s c onquer ed by t he I sr aelis.  I was posit ive  tha t  

my mother is fi nished with, b
ecause that's where sh
e lived.  I was positive that if Haifa was 
conquered, my mo ther mu st be dead.  So that 
happy occ asion where eve r
ybody ca me  out and t he y  
were dancing, and they brought out 
fr om the freezers the little appl
es that they were saving for a 
speci al occ a sion, I don't know.  And ever ybody was r
eally in s uch a joyous  
mo od.  It took me ti me  
fr om being awakened in the mi
ddle of the night 
t o underst and the co
nse que nces and the  
ra mi ficati ons  of thi s ne ws .  
So t hat  wasn't  easy eit h er. 
Q: Why don't you just ki nd of te
ll me briefly what happ
ened aft e r?  You we
r e on the kibbutz for 
three and a half years.  
Palestine became Isr ael. 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: And you were at that poi
nt re joi ne d wit h your fa mil y or  wit h your mother?  
A: My mother remarried.  I never 
met the man t h at she re
ma r r ied at  that poi nt
.  My mother just 
announced t o me in a lett er that
 she has re mar r ied, she has gott en re ma rrie d  and t hat t he y would li ke  
me  to  c o me ho me .

And it was  good ne ws a nd bad ne ws  for me .  It  was 
good news because fi nally
 I ' m goi n g to be wit h 
her.  It was bad news to
 me because in my little 
mind I probably conj
ured up this ima ge that if my  
mother is going to remarr
y, I have de cide d i n a dvance  that I ' m 
going t o hat e thi s i ndi vi dual , and I  
will not -- he cannot re
place my fa ther.  At that 
point my mother knew very we
ll that my father is n o  
longer alive. And she consult ed w
ith my br other, who wa s in the 
Na vy, who was als o close r .  Th e  
Na vy wa s in  Hai f a, s o th ey sa w 
e a c h  other quit e  fre quentl y.  An
d s he intr oduce d the ma n that she  
wa s goi ng t o ma r r y to my brot her , and my br ot he
r was all for it.  But nobody consulted me, and 
nobody introduc ed me . 
 I  was far a wa y, I was not near Hai f a. 
 An d s o I wa s bro u
ght back to Haifa 
fr om t he kibbutz , a nd I l eft  the  ki
bbutz.  And I ca me ba
ck to Haifa, swearing
 to myself that I'm 
goi ng to r eal ly hat e this ma n and I ' m not going to obe
y him.  This was what went on in mind at that 
time , but really in no ti
me at all  I realized what a nice in
di vidual s he mar r ied.  And he wa s a  
survi vor also, who lost hi s wi fe 
a nd t wo c hildr en in the war.  And 
his ol de st daught er wa s my age ,  
and she ha d my middle na me, Suzanna
h (ph) .  And so he 
wa s quite a nic e fat her t o me;  I think he  
love d me  de arly.  And that ha d a 
ver y  good e f fect  on my li fe .  He
 was a good fa mily man.  He wa s  
extremely, extremely 
sensitive.  But at the time 
that I came back to Haifa,
 I felt estranged fr om my  
mother .  I mean she was i mport ant to me , but I no long
er felt that need t o be th
at close.  Or I think I  
had als o a l ot of anger i n me pr
obably that was never verbal ized. But by the time
 I  got bac k t o  
Hai f a, start e d s chool , a n d t hen thi ngs  
were  done  i n very 
haphazard way.   
 

02: 44: 10 

 

I arri ved to Hai fa, I was at
 that time in the fourth
 grade.  And t hey de cide
d since I was older -- and I 
was probabl y a fairly decent st udent .   I wasn't 
a super stude n t, but I wa s good, aver a ge stude nt. 

The y deci de d that oh, it 's  ti me to 
ma ke up a gra de .   So I we nt for hal f
 a year in the fourth grade, and 
in the mi ddl e of t he year , I tr ansfe
rre d to the  fi ft h gra de.  I t hi nk 
they would have 
done  muc h better  
if t he y woul d s kipped fourth gra de 
a l toget her and put me  in
 t h e fi ft h  gra de ri ght  i n fr o m  t he st art , s o  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
35 
 
I will have an equal opportunity to st art at the same
 level.  But by the time I 
starte d fi fth grade in the 
mi ddle of the year , I was tota
lly lost again.  And this time they 
lost me from mat h for e ver , I wa s not  
a big ma the mati cia n.  And I t hink fr om multi plyi ng 
a nd divi ding, I got int o 
fracti ons.  And I neve r  
learne d t he basic s of how to de
al with fractions in the beginni
ng of the  year , and I  think it wa s  
extre me l y di ffi cult .  Extr e mely di ff
icult.  I got into a ve
r y good gra de .  I  got 
int o a  good gr ade in  
terms socially, it was very compatib
l e  and terri fi c.  But academically
, especi ally in mat h, I had a lot  
of di fficult y that dragge d on a nd o
n.  I  always needed a private t uto
r .  Some how I c oul d never catc h 
up to what  I lost.   
Q: So you fi nished school. 
 You grew up in Ha
ifa with your newl
y constituted family?  
A: Right.  I grew up in Haifa.  In the years th
at I was growing up, elementary school was through 

eight h gra de .   There was onl y ele ment ary school a
nd hi gh sc hool.  There was 
no middle  school.  So  
you went  for eight year s to elem
entary and fo ur years of high 
sc hool.  And whe n I fi nis he d  
ele ment a ry s c hool, t he ei ght h gra de , it was by my
 mot her 's re comme ndat i on that I shoul d maybe  
look into a t echnical hi gh school , where I coul d l
earn a pr ofes sion a nd I ca n fi nis h my high school  

dipl oma.  At  fir st I didn't wa nt t o 
hear about it, but then 
I decided that that 's a 
ver y good i dea .  And I  
we nt a nd I l ooked at a s chool, a nd I  like d it  ver y
 mu ch .  It wa s 
very cr eative, and I  was a very  
creati ve chil d.  I guess I had a lot of creativit y in 
me that I di dn't eve n know t hat exi s ted.  And I  
we nt to the s chool, a nd that 's wher
e I really bl os some d, beca us e we lear ne d a lot of t hings that wer e  
of interest.  Yo u know, we  l
ear ne d how to s e w a n d how t o e m
broi der  and how 
to knit.   
 

02: 47: 02 

 

And a l ot of the cre ative  handwor k a nd cr a fts -- exc u
se me - - and I succeeded
 quite nicely in the 
school , and that hel pe d me a lot .  By the ti me 
I  fini she d my high sc hool  diploma t he r e, I had a  
profe ssi on al so.  And I  went bac k 
for an extra year  for a teacher 's se
mi nary, so that  I bec a me a n ar ts  
and craft s teacher .  And soon t her
eafter, I got married.

Q: Well, I don't know if this ques
tion is a little bi
t off the point. 
A: It 's oka y. 
Q: But how long did it ta ke you to fe el like ki nd 
of on s olid ground a gain af
t er all the upr ooti ng of  
your li fe i n Eur ope, and then
 even your fir st few years 
in Isra el  or  Palesti ne ? 
A: In Israel i tsel f? 

Q: You know, I'm su
re t here was a poin
t at which . . . 
A: I t hink t hr ough high sc hool, I felt 
fa irly c onfi de n t.  Soli d gr ound, ne
ver .  I don't t hink --  I 'm on a s  
solid ground as anybody could ever 
hope for now in my li
fe .  But I will never 
feel on solid ground  
in this lifetime.  I fe el -- I don't dwell on it.  I 
really don't dwell on it, beca
use I like to dwell on the 
posit ive  ve rs us t he  ne gati ve.  Even as  a c hil d, Pa s s
over ti me, t hey used to 
all bri ng up ever ythi ng 
that happened in the Hol ocaust. 
 You know, they talkabout the exit fro m Egypt
 and, you know, our 
forefathers coming out of Egypt. 
 And they start e d in 
a bout what happe ne d, how they rounde d us  
up, how thi s  one walke d  through Ital y.  The othe
r one went t o concent r at ion ca mp.  You know,  
ever ybody brought up their stor y, a nd 
it used t o dr ive me cr azy as a chil d.  At that point , I sai d, " We  

are alr eady i n Isr ael .  We are already i n freedom.  
Why do we  have to talk 
about it?"  I realized why 

we had to ta l k about i t , of cour se.  And many ti me
s I bla me d mysel f bec aus e of that, t hat  I didn't ask  

all the questions while my parents -- 
while they were alive.  I didn't wa
nt t o deal wit h i t , so I di d not 
ask all the questions.   

 

02: 50: 03 

 

And reall y I wa s in Israel  the other da y, and I sat wi
t h my brot her and my c ousi n who was wit h us in  
concentr ation camp, we we
r e dis cus s i ng it .  And ever ybody has 
just al most awakened to ask t he  
que stions , a nd nobody has pare nts a nymore to a sk th
em fr om.  Wh ile they we
re ali v e, none of us 
wa nte d to  d eal wit h it .  Ok ay?  
 So , yes, you say you'
re confident, and mayb
e you pretend to be 
confi dent, I don't know.  But I -- 
as I said, I dwell on the positi ve, 
a nd I thi nk about, you know, in a  
posit ive  way.  But t o sa y I 'm on soli d ground, I 'm 
not afrai d t h at tomorrow 
some body's goi ng t o t el l

me  to pa ck up and move. 
 But I will never say th
at it c annot  happe n a gai n.  Ther e ar e  ti mes  whe n 
we j oke or we s it around and tal k, a nd, sa y, i n c ase
 of e mer genc y -- I use  it, 
in c ase of e me r genc y, 
somet hing di sastr ous would ha ve ha ppene d to us.  Let 's se e, what 
can we do?   What ar e the skill s  
that we have?  What is it
 that we  ca n do t o sur vive ?   It 's al wa ys
 in t he  ba ck o f my  mi nd so me w here .  
God for bid t hat I  s hould have t o. 
 I ' m not  looki ng for ward to t hi s. 
Q: I 'm wondering whet her the lack
 of absolute confi dence or s
ecurity is part of the hu man  
condition. 

A: Very possible. 

Q: Certai nly temper ed by
 you r experiences and wh
at you we nt t hrough. 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: And the n  also, ma ny years i n Isra el, whic h 
is -- you know, which has bee n a vola t ile place t o  
live. 

A: It has been a volatile place to li ve, but on the ot
her hand, I have t o tell you
 I thi nk i f 
I would have 
grown up i n  any ot her c ountry but Is rael, I would ha
ve bee n e motionall y a  mu ch si cker  person.  I  
think there was someth
i ng in Isr ael that I have to give a 
lot of credit to.  There was something 
per meated i n  the air , in t h e at mospher e, in t he surr
oundi ng.  I a l wa ys fe lt sa fe
 i n Israel when I was 
growi ng up, in spi t e of al l the 
goings on.  And I t hink what - -  th
ere wa s s o methi ng pe r me ating the 
air, and I  thi nk the message t hat  I hear d was 
we  love the c hildre n.  The y are  our  fut ure . 

 

02: 53: 05 

 

 You ar e i m porta nt.  And I 'm not t a
l king me, physicall y, a s an indi vidu
al, but rather all the children. 
The chil dren wer e cherished, not 
just  by t heir par ents , but by the 
neighbor s.  By t he pe ople on t he  
street .  Ther e  wa s s o met hi ng healt hy 
in the ai r.  There was somet hing 
health going on, in spite of the 
pain, in spite  of eve r yt hing else
.  In spite of the fact that th
ere wa s no ps yc hol ogi
cal counseling and  
no group therapy and no this andno that.  Maybe the group therap
y was that they 
allowed us to  
grow up, to be c hil dren as much
 as  pos sibl e.  That you we r e in
 the youth move me nt.  You were  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
38 
 
encouraged to participate.  We we re encouraged to
 danc e.  We wer e enc our age d to e njoy our sel ves . 
The r e was s o methi ng ve ry he althy going on in t he at
mos phe re t hat ga ve us s o me confi de nce , eve n i f  
it was a false se nse of confid
ence by s o me, I don't know. 
Q: But felt s o me of t hose ...?  
A: Yeah.  I  felt sa
fe.  I fel t safe. 
Q: You talked a little bit about wh
en you made th
e transition from the kibbu
tz to Haifa, how you 
fel t  dista nce d fr om your  mot her and you felt a n
gry.  Had you a fe w qu
esti ons.  Had you by 
nece ssit y de velope d your own kind 
of strength and independence, an
d al most in sel f- de fe nse , wer e  
you a ngr y at your mothe r ? 

A: Ma ybe my mother
 wa sn't -- you know, it t
ook me a long ti me to grow
 up, t o realiz e, to  
underst and t he cir cumstances of 
her  life were not easy.  She wa
s not the most communicative 
pers on.  And there  were i nsta nce s, 
I  think, especi all y one t hat I  r ecall t hat I  was gr eatl y di sappoi nted  
by her.  She wa s suppos e d 
to come  and vi sit me on
 a ki bbutz, a nd t here wa
s  onl y one bus a day t hat  
came with the caravans.  And 
I was waiting and waiting 
for her, and she neve
r showed up.  And  
don't for get , there was no place to 
call .  I mean there no telephones. 
 Ther e wer e no -- the grocer an d 
some  ot her - -  the  phar ma cy had a  
tele phone .  Nobody had phones  at 
home .  So you c
ouldn't pick up 
the phone a n d s ay, " De ar, I 
a m s orry I  coul dn't come.  
This  a nd t his ha ppe ne d."   
 

 

 

 

02: 56: 03 

 

So I had to wait for the 
mail to arrive as to why she didn't 
s how up.  Well, s he  di dn't s how up  
because she traveled fr om Haifa 
to Tel Aviv, and she ha
d a fe w hours to kill.
  And she visited a 
fri end, and s he mi sse d the bus
.  And I couldn't get over it .  I couldn't ge t over it.  I'm not  sure that I  
have gotten over it, 
because obviously I 
still mention it.  An
d my mother, ma y sh
e rest in peace, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
39 
 
she 's de ad si nce '79.  That kind of a thing, it re
mained with me.  That 
maybe I felt it was more 
i mport ant for her to visi t her frie
nd.  I know it was not , and I ' m sure 
that she wa s sorel y di sappoi nted  
that mi ssed t he bus.  I  can i magin
e  her feeli ngs.  But  in those  da
ys, you j ust did not  c o mmunicat e  
and say, " Y ou ha ve no i d ea how sorry
 I a m or how ups et I wa s, that
 I didn't -- and I 'll ma ke it up t o  
you."  What ever .  The facts were sta t ed, a nd tha t
 was it.  My mot her di dn't -- she wa s a sensiti ve  
pers on, but s he di dn't know how to
 communicate in a sens
iti ve wa y.  And so thi ngs l i ke t hat a nd 
some other little episodes that ca
used, we had a goo
d relationship with each
 other, but it wasn't a 
close , cl ose war m r elati onshi p.  I hea r  someti me s 
people talk about their 
mothers, how much they 
mis s t he m a nd how muc h -- how cl
ose they were.  How devastated
 they wer e.  Ever ythi ng, you  
know, because their mot her passed
 a wa y.  I wa s  ver y hurt when
 she pa ssed a wa y.  I loved he r 
dearl y.  I wa sn't  devastat ed, I hurt for  her.  I hur t fo
r the li fe t h at she had.  
I unde rsta nd her.  And in a  
way, I have forgiven fo r 
this or that little thing, you know. 
 Our lives, the circumstances were 
horre ndous.  I woul d not  have want e d
 to be the mother in t h ose year s.
  It was much easier to be a 
child.  M uch, 
much easier.

Q: You know, I thi nk it  see ms t hat
 when your mo ther didn't show up
 on your ki bbutz , it  must have 
bee n ve ry, very fri ght eni ng beca us e you had alre a
dy l ost one parent .  You had bee n separated fr o m  
your mothe r  fr om 
time to time . 
A: What tha t  mea nt in t hos e da ys
, it's not the same thing.  It's 
not somet hing that you can even 
compr ehe nd in ter ms of your  dail
y l i fe  today, bec a use  it 
wasn't the missing of 
t he bus or  the  -- t he 
pain that we nt wit h it wa s so over whel mi ng.  Th
e  disappoi nt ment was so great, beca use  you were a  
child alone i n the kibbut z, and I pr
oba bly have not seen my mot her 
for six mont hs.  And she j ust did 
not show up.  And it wasn't thatshe could come b
ack with the next bus th
at will come 
the fo llowing 
day.  Beca use s he  ha d on
ly that  weekend, she ha
d to go bac k  to Hai fa be caus e s he  was worki ng. 
She was al one, she needed t o ma
ke a living.  So the comprehens
ion of nowa days whe re you could 
pick up a phone and you can c all, 
and so what i f she mi sse d not c o
mi ng?   So she  will  come next  
week.  That was not ther
e.  When she missed that bus, there 
was this child that was still standing 
there wait ing for her a n d conjuri
ng up t he i ma gi nation of bei ng hugg
e d a nd kisse d a n d loved.  She 
just didn't show up.  And 
in t he end, it took a not her  six mont hs, it 
wasn't  so simple for me  as a child.   
I didn't have somebody to tuck
 me in and hug me  
every day.  So t he 
disa ppoi nt ment  was  
horrendous, and it o
bviously had to be horrendous 
if I still speak about it at 
58 years old.  I should 
have gotten over it long ago, but this
 explains a little bit that I'm 
trying to think why was that little 
bit of e stra nge ment  bet w e en us .  It wa s n 't  an 
es trange ment , we  were fri ends in some  wa ys .   
 

03: 04: 06 

 

But in so me wa ys, that warmth th
at  we ha d for e ac h ot her  on my 
part changed.  
Some thi ng cha nged  
in for mul a.  I  guess  s he  was nee d
y in one wa y; I wa s n
eedy i n another  wa y.  
I t 's har d t o explain.

Q: Ma ybe  you could s u mmar ize  fo
r  me what happened after  high
 sc hool.  You  got ma rried?  
A: I got  mar ried i n 1957.  August 
'57.  To a young Isra
eli-born indi vidual  whos e pare nts  als o c a me  
fr om Hungary, but they were in Isra
el before the war, in the '30s.  
And so there was 
a sa bra, a nd my  
hus ba nd ri ght from t he begi nni ng spoke a bout t h e fact 
that he is -- he wants 
to come to A merica. 
Bec ause he felt that there  was a futur e , there i s some
t hing that  he -- he felt  
the nee d to go.  That he  
nee ds t o go, he  ne eds  to explor e.
  He ne eds to find hi
ms el f.  And, of c our
s e, I never took hi m 
seriousl y, because neither one of us came from 
homes t h at could afford
 t his l uxury of goi ng 
anywhere.  And I rea
lly didn't think we'll 
ever come to Ameri
ca, but so I let him 
talk.  But little did I 
know t hat at  that ti me , I didn't 
know my  husband well enough.  No w,
 I would beli eve hi m, but i n  
thos e da ys , I did not.  And he reall y ma de arr ange me
nts .  He had a n uncle  in
 the United States in 
Ne w Yor k, and he made  arrange me n
ts through a fri end who wa s in
 Ne w Yor k to arr ang e for th e 
papers and for his uncle to loan 
hi m the money t o come to t h e Un
it ed States.  And once we'll get  
here , we 'll work and we 'll  give hi m ba ck t he mone y. 
 An d with in si x mo nt h s , we  were i n th e Unit ed 
States.  So little did I kn
ow what I hit me.  We  
arrived in New Yo
rk, and we worked
 in New York,  
the t wo of us.  I worked in a 
sweat shop se wi ng doll cl othe s , 
and my husba nd who finished t he 
technical hi gh sc hool j ust  like me
, we nt to wor k a s a t ool and di
e ma ker i n  Br ooklyn, Ne w York. 
An d we wer e  loo kin g for  a way o f 
solving the situation.  Our fr iend
s talked us into teaching Hebrew 
school .   
 

 

 

03: 07: 00 

 

I had a teacher 's certi fi cat e anyway 
as a teacher , and my 
husband decided t o try 
it .  And we got a j ob  
as Hebrew school teachers in Sc
he ne ctady, Ne w York.  
During the summertime, not to re ma in in 
New York for such a 
long ti me , we went t o --  we  got a j ob 
in a camp.  It's ca
lled Ca mp Ra ma h (ph), 
whi ch is a  Hebre w-s pe aking ca mp.  
And really that was wo
nderful.  We spent 
the summer there, w e  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
42 
 
learne d a l ot.  And duri ng the wint
er, we t aught Hebre w s chool.  A
nd at tha t  poi nt, we have deci ded  
that t here ha s to be a pur pos e why 
we ca me .  We  coul d not j us t  leav
e Isra el , lea ve our fr iends, l eave  
our parent s, l eave t he home, and sp
end some ti me teachi ng 
Hebrew school.  That wasn't  enough.  So  
Si mon s t arte d se riously s t udying for his SATs, a nd 
tr yi ng t o learn by hi msel f how t o do - -  how t o  
take the tests and how to score.  An
d a ye ar l ater , we  felt
 that Schenectady, Ne w 
York is too isolated  
a place for us.  Thi s is just not 
-- wasn't the right place 
for two young people.  
We wer e  very, ver y  
lonel y and alone there .  And a fter s p endi ng a not
her summer in the summer 
ca mp, we  got a job in  
Qui nc y, Mas sachuse tts, whi ch i s s outh of Bost on, 15 
mil es south of Boston.  
And we we nt to teac h 
there i n a very lovely congregat
i on, and Si mon applied 
to BU and was accept e
d as an engineering 
student .  And s o our li fe wa s se
t.  We  both worked fu ll-time as 
Hebr e w s c hool te acher s, a nd Si mon 
we nt to school.  And he graduate
d wi thin four yea r s, ae ronauti cal
 engineeri ng.  Then once that wa s  
done, we move d to Ne w Yo
rk.  At  this st age  of our li ve s i n
 1964, we wer e marrie d about se ve n 
years or so, and we reall y --  alre
ady be for e ha nd we  reall y
 wanted to have childre
n, start a family.  I 
coul dn't have any c hildr en.  And s o as a res ul t
, we st arte d to l ook i n
to adoption which was  
i mpos sibl e.  In Boston t h ey had the  bl ue la ws.  
On ly Je wi sh  chi l
dren ca n a  J ewi sh couple  adopt , a nd  
you could not adopt a chil d 
out of your faith.  We 
went to New York, we app
lied aga i n for adopt ion.  
The situation was very si
milar  in thos e days and ve ry, very 
di ffic ult .   So Si mon worked for  
Grumman Aircraft for t wo years, an
d I went  back -- I l e ft
 t he  He bre w sc hool  teac hing, whic h wa s a 
good job a nd wonder ful.   
 

03: 10: 04 

 

But I really desir ed a more creati ve 
job, and I wanted to desi gn dress es.  J us t  really wha t .  I learned ,  
and I was a dress designer for  a chil dren's manufactur
er in New York.  Wh en 
we r e alized that we 
will never be able to adopt a 
child in New Yo
rk, two years la
ter Simo n looked for a job in 
California, Los Angeles.  
Everybody told us that it
's much easi er to adopt 
children in Los Angeles, 
and t hat 's t he place for us to go. 
 And so we took off, literally t o ok 
off.  Si mon got 
a j ob through the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
43 
 
Wa ll Street Journal with L
itten Industries, and 
we arrived in Los 
Angeles, total stra
ngers again.  The 
wa nde ring J ews.  We ar rived in Los  Angel es , we 
did not know a soul.  I th
in k we wer e  in mo t e l  
when we applied for adopti on 
thr ough the Los Angel es Count y 
of Adoption Agenc y.  And we  
started working:  Simon at
 Litten; me as a dress de
signer.  Wo rked very har
d, the two of us, to make  
end me et.  And ni ne mont hs late
r we got our s on, our fir st child. 
 And we na med hi m Terre nce , a 
nice Iri sh na me .  And we ga ve hi m 
a  He bre w na me , Aloni m (ph) , wh
ic h is an oak tre e.  Nice and 
strong.  And actuall y we call hi m 
Terr y or Aloni m, depe ndi ng on what
 the mood i s.  
And toda y he 's  
28 ye ars ol d, he 's marrie d.  He lives up in Ver mo n
t wit h his wi fe .  An d h e
 has no c hi l dren, and I 
don't think he desires to have 
any.  Later on, we 
adopted a little girl, an
d we named her Core y 
Tamar, but actually she's called Ta
mmy.  So she ' s not usi ng a ny of 
for ma l  na mes .  Eve r ybody call s  
her Ta mmy, and she 's 24 years old.  And she 's  e
nga ged to be marri ed, and she 's fi nishi ng he r  
Master 's Degree in social work at
 Boston Uni vers ity.  And a  year
 from now in October, she'll get 
mar r ied t o a wonder ful y
oung ma n who is at Yale  
La w School .  And t he t wo chil dre n really -- t he  
two children with us form
ed our little fa mily.  And we
 raised them in Califo
rnia partially, and then 
Si mon got  a  very good j o b over  here
 in Wa shington an
d we mo ved.   
03: 13: 00 
 

Terr y wa s four a nd a half year s ol d, and Ta mm
y wa s seven months old.
  And we move d to 
Wa shington.  So I arrived with 
two little kids in a brand new ar
ea.  Again, not knowing almost  
anyone.  But  before l ong, you know, we ma de fri ends,
 and we realize d re ally that it does n't matt er  

where you l i ve.  It 's the  fri ends 
t hat  you make i n the place that 
c ounts .  Every strange pl ace i s  
strange at fi rst until you make so me
 friends.  And now we have so ma
ny friends, we don't have time  
for e ver ybody.  And we 
li ve out  in Pot o mac .  
Q: I gue ss  you lear ned t o

A: Yes.  Absolutely. 

Q: Beca use  you had bee n upr oote d . . .

A: So ma ny ti me s.  I have move d s o ma ny ti me s t hat 
it's really hard to coun

the ci ty, you know, you l ive i n one  dwelli ng;  the n 
you move to a not her a nd you move to another.  
And you go t o s u mmer  a n d 
you come  back and forth.  
Q: What wer e your  bi gge st s urp
rises wh en you arrived in Ne w Yo

A: No.   No .   Ne w Yo rk  ov er whel med a nd  sca r e d 
me .  Number one , we  a

and t he dar k brick buildi n gs whi ch I  
was not -- my eyes were not used 
to.  All the build

are pai nted whi t e or off- whi t e or , you know, the y  ar

ed to this tremendous 
sunshi ne s hi ning on top of t hese  br ight buil dings. 
 I felt  c l ose d in, it fri ght ene d me .  It  reall y  
fri ght ene d me.  It t ook ti me .  
Not  a l ong ti me  bec a use  we ha d to
 bounc e on our fe et

start going.  And we didn't have t w

go t o wor k, I  had ten ce nt s to go on 
the subway one way.  In those da

 It di dn't stop --  the  train didn't

I wasn't sure where I was, and I -- 
in my little broken En

the police officer.  And I said, "Are
 you sure that it's here?  Because 
i f it 's not here and I cannot get  
to work, I  ha ve onl y t en c ent

Q: Wa s a Ne w Yor k or t h e United St
at es cult urall y shocki ng t o you?   Just the wa y pe opl e live d -- or  
treate d you?  

A: I didn't go too much into the 
culture.  I just was over whel med, 
for instance, surpri sed.  We  
arrive d to Si mon's uncle ,  who was 
from Hungary, and his wi
fe was also from Hungary.  We arrived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
45 
 
and they we re eati ng a n d watc hi ng televi sion.  I 
found it  te rribly rude .  You know, I c oul dn't  
underst and t his.  I c oul d not c o mpre
hend t his .  Be caus e , fi rst of a ll, 
when we l e ft Isr ael, they didn't  
have tele visi on so t hat 's one det ail.  But  se cond, 
when guests  or s o me body 
-- st ranger came t o t he 
house , then you sat  a
nd you tal ked t o the m ar ound 
t he tabl e.  You di dn't look
 at televisi
on.  I me a n  
the cars a nd ever ythi ng, ever ythi ng 
wa s a bit overwhel mi ng at fir st.  But  in our own mode st way,  
you know, we scale d thi n gs
 down.  We kne w how to lo
ok inwa rd and to know 
what we coul d a fford 
and what  we cannot a
fford.  I mean i t wasn't  that  di ffi cult  
for me to say -- we were not needy as  
much.  You know, we 
c o uld ea sily sa y, " We ll, we 're not going to buy anot her s kirt or a not her pair  
of pa nts or a not her s hirt, beca use we just ca n't a f ford
 it thi s yea r.  It 's okay, 
we 'll do it next year." 
And it ne xt  year ca me and we co
ul dn't a f for d it, we 'll sa y, " Well , that 's oka y, we 'l l do it the  
following year."  But both of us 
were very grounded, a
nd we had very strong 
priorities.  We knew  
where it 's at , we knew we 
had a goal .  Once we decide
d that we have a goal a nd Si mon has t o go to 
school a nd we ar e going to ma ke it,
 not matt er what, we 
al ways looked at the 
right things.  And to 
be ver y hone st with you, we  ha ve  ma ny friends  w
ho came from Isra
el, and mo st of them got some  
help fr om home.  We real
ly di d it on our own.  Our  pare nts c oul
d not a f for d to hel p us.  We hel pe d  
our par e nts , we  us ed to s e nd mo
ney home, too.  Especially Si mon'
s pare nt s, beca us e hi s fat her wa s  
ill, and he could no 
longer work.  Looki
ng back then, we didn't think 
it was not fair.  We  did n o t 
think that it i s over w hel ming -- we di
dn't think we were th
at unusual.  We really 
took it that this is 
fi ne, and everything that we
 did we felt, well, this is a step --  just a little step better than what we 
had before.   

 

03: 19: 05 

 

Every little success or every little achi
evement that we achieved, it was 
great.  Both of us are very 
opti mi stic pe ople , and we  reall y al ways felt  
that our  cup i s more  
than half full.   
Q: After fleeing Europe for 
I srael , did you ever fe e l  c
onflicted about leaving Israel? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
46 
 
A: Very much so.  I felt so c
onflict e d a bout le aving Isra el, I neve
r li ked, for i nstance, my Hebrew  
na me , Ri fka, that I  go 
by.  I felt so conflicted
 that I purpos el y di d not us e my Hunga r ian na me , 
which I happen to like, Vera. 
 It 's a much easi er name
 to go by in the United 
States.  My fa mily calls 
me by t hat na me.  But I wa s so proud that I c a m e 
fr om Isr ae l  that I sai d no, I ' m goi n g to use my 
Hebrew name; I'm not going to use 
-- I totally eliminated 
my fir s t na me e ve n as a mid dl e  na me .  I 
felt very, very bad that we le
ft  Isr ael at that  ti me.   
Q: What -- i s ther e anythi
ng t hat you can t hink of that re ally go
t you t hrough all  the se early di ffic ul t 
experiences?   Any sort  of  sur vival skil
ls?  Any special stre
ngths or  c our age ? 
A: I think primarily it was the courag
e to bear, to try, to ask.  To -- 
not to be afraid.  To -- the worst 
could happen so 
somebody will say no to 
you.  I wasn't that afraid of re
jection, or at least I thought 
that I may not take it t ha t  pers onall y.  Espe ciall y 
on thi ngs tha t  were not e motional .  You know, t o  
dare a little bit.  That's not to say 
that I was that courageo
us or that -- I'm sure 
that I had my fears, 
and I had my uncertainti es 
and my  fe eling of not belo
ngi ng in certai n pla c es.  
It really takes time to  
belong to an area or to belong to
 a community, or to be
long anywhere .  A l ot of people, a lot of 
Israeli s are here for many
, ma ny year s , a nd t he y love li ving her e
 and so fort h, but  they feel a certai n  
sense of not belongi ng.  I  
no longer  have t hat .  I  know t hat I  ha
ve an accent.  I k
now t h at everybody  
can i m media t ely dete ct t h at I was not bor n here
, but I ' m not  a fr aid t o spe ak my mi nd.   
 
03: 22: 02 

 

And I feel totally comfo rtable in th
e Uni t ed States.  I feel ver y mu
ch at home.  I don't have those 
conflicts anymore.  Because you ha
ve to ma ke up your 
mind, it 's eit her you 
bel ong or you don't  
belong.  I f you don't bel
ong, at  lea st we ha ve a fr
ee count ry.  Nobody
's holding a gun t o my hea d. 
One can pick up and go back, a
nd over t here I speak wit hout an
 accent.  But I fe el totally 
comfortabl e here , and I must sa y th
a t  maybe wit h one or two exce pti
ons  that I don't eve n wa nt t o  
recall or I don't even reme
mber , I feel that I have 
al ways been tr eated fairly
 i n America.  I reall y  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
47 
 
don't ever feel uncomfo rtable 
or not  belongi ng or that s o mebo
dy ma de  me  feel -- or wa s anti-
Semitic to me.  I know
 it exists.  I mean
 nobody is blind to
 the facts of life . 
Q: Do you t h ink that  your  strong 
groundi ng in reli gion wa s i m porta nt
 to you t hroughout  all of this?  
A: Ab sol utel y.  Ab sol ute ly.  I ' m 
not a religi ous person, but I sent 
my da ughter t o the Je wish da y 
school , because I  felt t hat  she need
s t h at gr oundi ng, too.  
She needs to know.  I 
st arte d wit h my son, 
we t ook hi m out , whic h I later on, I regrett ed.  
But that was beca use t he y  did not have a sc hool  
establ ished yet, and I di dn't see in my  blurre d vi si
on, I didn't see that t hat w
ill come .  And it was j ust 
really too difficult physically, the 
dri ving bac k and forth, bac k  and fo
rt h to school.  So he went to 
public school, but she went to the Je
wish day school.  But I 
tried to instill in th
em all the values of 
Judais m, bec ause  Judai s m t o me , it 's  not  how reli giou
s you ar e; it 's a way of 
li fe .  It 's  how you live  
your li fe .  What kind of a pers on
 you are.  How 
you tre at other  people .  How you behave  towa rds  
anot her pers on.  What ki nd of e xa mples you set for yo
ur chil dren.  That 's  what J udais m is for me . 
It's not just a religion, it's rea
lly a wa y of li fe .  And I could no
t be a nyt hi ng but Je wis h, no matter  
wh at.  I'm very proud of 
being wh o I am.  I have 
no pr oble ms  wi th mysel f . 
 
03: 25: 00 

 

Q: Are ther e certai n i mages t hat
 you haven't mentioned that -- th
at you have mentioned, that 50 
years later still haunt you fr
om the years of the war? 
A: No, not anymore.  Not anymor
e.  As I sai d, now t hat the 
c hildren are grown up a nd they're 
wonder ful , a nd I have a fa mi l y whic
h I adore, not a nymore.  I think wh
en I raised them as they gr ew 
up, a lot of the things th
at I did not deal wit h as
 a child came back to ha
unt me .  Ca me  ba ck to  
bot her me, c a me bac k to -- that I nee d ed to talk a b out
.  And for a while I went for hel p for that .  All 
the things that happened, all the things that I 
wa s telling you about , bei n g i n a  ki bbutz a nd bei ng 
wit h -- and t he earl y chil dhood, and t he fear s of 
c hildhood of being in ca mp, and bei ng taken a wa y  
fr om home  l i ke t his , a nd bei ng upr
ooted in such a rude 
wa y.  Another t hing th
at I  ha ve  to t ell yo u 
which I forgot completely and that 's  something th
at you ought to 
know, you reme mber wh en I told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352

you when we left Hunga r y, my moth
er took out t he par chme n t from t he M ezuz ah?   She  carried it to 
our c onc entr ation c a mps wit h her , and she had it i n 
Israel .  She neve r put i t  in a case a nd she ne ver  
hung it on t h e door.  And while s he 
was ali ve one summer and I visite
d, she gave it to
 me.  And s he 
said, " One day whe n you have a ho
me of your own, you s houl d put 
it on your door ." 
 Wh ile I had a 
home in California, I never put it 
up.  I ha d a home , t wo homes , here
 in Potomac, a 
townhouse and a  
house .  I never put it up.  And we fi
nal l y move d to this pres ent house , an
d I said, "This is it.  This is  
the time to put it up."  I don't kn
ow why all thes e years , I di d not .  
I said, "This is the time that we 
are goi ng to dedi cate thi s  Mezuz ah and we ar e goi ng to
 put it up."  And act ually, I have a very goo d  
fri end who i s Ra bbi Wall berg fr om Aziz, Isra el.  
And when I told him the story about the Mezuzah,  
they surpri sed me an
d they brought me  a very --  I sai d, "I
'm looking for a Mezu
zah that is large  
enough for t his parchment.
  It 's  so long."  And 
he  brought me  a bea uti ful mar ble Mez uza h, a nd we 
dedi cated t h e Mezuzah i nside, 
indoor s, not  outdoors.   
 

03: 28: 06 

 

Bec ause it was too pr ecious for me to hang it out doors .  I have  a s maller one out side .  And so we  

hung that Mezuzah, and I'
m sure that one day I w
ill give it to my daughter
.  This is the fa mily 
inheri tance.  That 's 
it.  No more , no le s s.  But  it 's
 an important in
herita nce .   
Q: Let me  ask you sort 
of a stra nge  question. 

A: It 's oka y. 

Q: The fact  t hat you were  part  of re all y a  ve
ry pri v ilege d group to ge
t out of Hu ngary . . . 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: . . . even t hou
gh you had to ma ke
 an ugly detour. 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: You got to Switzer
land and you got to
 Palesti ne  sa fe ly. 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: Di d you e ver feel  a li tt
le bit  guilt y a bout t hat?    

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
49 
 
A: Not the least bit.  Why should
 I fe el guilty?  Because I survived
?  Thank God that
 some of us 
survived to tell the story.
  We c oul d have all di ed j ust the s a
me.  And you woul d have ne ver ha d me  
sitting here telling this to 
you.  I'm not ap
ologetic.  I think that he de
serves all the 
kudos in world. 
Q: Kast ner?  
A: Yes .  

He got a raw deal .  And now they 
are commemorating a forest  in hi s 
na me .  He got a  ver y ra w dea l . 
His daught er  got a terri bl e deal .  And, you know, 
it says , " He who sa ves one 
soul is a s  though he  
save d the world."  He sa ved 1,700 s o uls.  What do
es he deser ve?   He put his li fe on t h e line ever y 
day duri ng t hat war , and he put in j e opar dy ever ybody
's li fe.  He tri ed hi s best .  I cr y for al l the  
people who did not sur vi ve.  My fa ther did not 
survive .  I have aunt s and uncl es and c ousi ns wh o 
never c a me bac k.  Peopl e with br oke n lives .  I f  
he would ha ve die d, woul d it ha ve sa ved the m?  

Thank God that some of us
 survived.  Whether 
it's me  or so
mebody else.  I 
should feel guilty?  I fe el 
sad t hat t her e are such human bein
gs in this world that are this
 inhu mane, that are capable of 
murdering without reason, 
killing without reason, a
nd hating so much.   
 

 

03: 31: 04 

 

You know, i t 's a ma zing 
t o me t hat we  who r eally have gone  th
rough so mu ch with 
capacity to love. 
I don't ha ve the ca pac ity in me t o ha t e.  I onl y 
have the capacity to be 
comp assionate for somebody 
else, whether it's a person
 like me or  somebody else, a di ffer ent
 col or, a di fferent race, di ffer ent  
religi on -- I  don't c are .  And I ' m no
t alone, I know t hat most people
 a r e good.  We  br ought it upon 
ours elves?   I don't want  to hear t hi s.  There 
ar e too ma ny dece nt huma
n live s l ost, t oo ma ny 
bea uti ful  pe ople.  No
t just them who 
died, but the potential 
of what t hey coul d 
have  be come  and t he  
fa milies that they c
oul d have  br ought  up to thi s 
world.  Not t he least bit .  
Q: This is your only question. 
 Duri ng chil dhood whi ch wa s really di srupt ed, do you now, ha vin g  
thought about this for a  long ti me , see that it took 
a toll on you?   Or that it maybe ,  the rever se ,  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
50 
 
strengthene d  you, but tha t you s
ee sor t  of a  long-t e r m i mpa ct on 
you and how it  a f fe cts t he wa y you  
live today? 
A: You know, when I raised
 my children, I -- maybe 
I was a little more
 overprotective 
of them than  
someti me s ma ybe woul d have be en healt hy, I don't 
know.  I live very well. 
 We did very well for  
ours elves.  Si mon went into hi s own busi nes s and he
 did very well.  We li ve a ver y char med li fe  
now.  I don't  have fi nanci al worries .  I don't ha ve
 t o worry about worki ng or
 not wor king anymore .  
In fact , it wa s very funny, I stoppe d a t  Bridges 
of Ge orgetown toda y, a nd 
a young girl , ma ybe 18, 
she co mes over.  She sa ys, "My, you l ook nice today. 
 We ski p ped wor k today, didn't we? " she said 
to me.  And I thought to my sel f 
-- I didn't a ns we r, but I thought t o 
myself it really takes a certain 
audacity, first of all, to turn to 
a cust omer  to assume.  And I  r eally
 wante d  to s ay, " Act ually, I ' m not 
wo rking.  I don't 
have t o i f I don't  want to."   

 

03: 34: 05 

 

I worked ple nty t hroughout
 my life , but I was 
thinking it to myself.  On 
t he other  ha nd, I  don't  ev e r  
take a nyt hing for grant e d, a nd I never forget where I came from.  
An d I always think that I know 

where I ' m going, but I ne ver 
pr etend t hat I was bor n into t his or  
this was just someth
ing that came to 
me rightfully so.  I really appr
eci ate ever y da y, a nd I t hank e very da
y for  what I have  and t hat I ' m  
able  to gi ve i nstea d of rec eiv
ing.  I t 's  a  gre at feeling. 
Q: Anyt hi ng else  you would like  t o a d d?  

A: Well , the onl y thing that one ca n 
add is that I hope throughout this
 experi ence, I 'm just afrai d that  
it 's onl y those who ar e alrea dy human bei ngs
 and who already ar e kind and already ar e 
underst anding ar e t he ones t hat will
 l ook at  these  tapes or
 that will take the ti
me  t o st udy it or to  
learn or to go into the museum.  
But if it ca n cha n ge one har d heart 
to be c o mpa ssi ona
te to a fellow 
human being, it was all worth it.  To put it on tape, not
 to live it -- not to have lived it.  To put it on 
tape .  It 's rea lly one j ust can hope tha t  we - -  al
wa ys I hope we  learn some
thing from it, but I'm not 
sure.  It al ways worries me when 
t h e state me nt of hatr ed c o me out . 
 Wh ether it's fr om this end or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352  
51 
 
that end, it frightens me.  All the 
extremes who have no toleran
ce fo r somebody el
se who's a little 
bit di ffer ent than you are,
 it really frightens me.  So one c an j u
st hope for t he be st, a nd I think a l o t  
of e ducati on nee ds t o be  done . 
 A lot, a lot of education. 
 That 's a ll tha t  I  ca n a dd. 
Q: Thank you. 
A: You're very welcome.
