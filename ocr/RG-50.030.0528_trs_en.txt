HENRY GALLANT 
May 11, 2009 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, He
nry. It™s nice to see you. 
Answer: Good morning. 
Q: What -- what was your name  at birth? 

A: Well, actually my name at birth was -- my 
fi rst name  was Heinz and my last name was 
Goldstein or Goldstein -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- depending on where you are 
or where you want to be.  
Q: And you s -- 

A: Heinz Goldstein. 

Q: Heinz -- Heinz Goldstein. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Did you have a mi ddle name? 

A: No. 

Q: No. And you changed your name
 much later, to Henry? 
A: That™s a long story. That -- that
™ll take us from one point to a
nother point. I changed my na me  
-- at first I used the name  of Henry Gallant, I did 
not change the name  officially until past certain 
events in the U.S., and -- 

Q: So we can come to that later. 

A: -- we™ll co me to that --  we can
 come  to that later, right, yes. 
Q: So I™m going to call you Henry now, 
is that okay, instead of Heinz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

A: That™s perfectly all right, yeah. 
Q: Is that okay? 

A: Perfectly all right. 

Q: Tell me  about your mother and father. Tell me
 about your father. What -- what did he -- what 
was his profession? 

A: My father -- my father™s family was a typi
cal German Jewish family, with the emphasis on 
German. They were a very good fa mily, very loving family, but they -- as was the case in 

Germany with the -- with Jewry, the -- they were
 German first, Jewish second, perhaps. As 
opposed to Jew first and -- and German second. They 
were very patriotic. My father was in the 
military at -- during World War I, and his pict ur
e tells a whole story. I me an, his composure, the 
way he sits. That picture is in th
e -- in the Jewish heritage and 
Holocaust museum in Atlanta. He 
sits on a -- on a horse in a -- in a very Prussian
 way, very erect. And he was very proud of his 
origin, in that sense. 
Q: And he™s wearing a uniform in that picture? 
A: Correct. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. And -- 

Q: You know, Henry, I forgot to ask you, when were you born? 

A: 1928.  

Q: What was the -- the month and the day? 

A: October 30
th
, 1928. 
Q: And you were born where? 

A: In Berlin. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
3 
 
Q: In Berlin. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did your father come from Berlin? 

A: No, my father™s family came fr om Westfalia
 and they lived in a small town in -- called 
Iserlohn and my grandfat
her was a veterinarian. 
Q: Oh. 

A: And not in the sense that he was treati
ng cats and poodles, but ma inly he served the 
community. They were farmers, so he was more
 into treating horses and cows and so fa -- 
Q: So he did the big animals. 

A: Yeah, he -- they were integr ated into -- 
into a small town community in Westfalia.  
Q: And that was your father™s father? 

A: That was my father™s fa mily. 

Q: Right. 
A: And he had four brothers, one of whom died 
in World War I, for his 
then country and he had 
another br other who saw things comi ng in 1933, befo -- when Hitler came to power and he 
emigrated to Palestine. And another brother w
ho lived in Dortmund. So anyway, he had four -- 
four brothers. 

Q: Wa s he close with them?  

A: It was a -- yeah, yeah, it was a close-knit family. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Although my -- my gr andfather marri
ed twice, really. His first wife 
died and as is -- it™s really 
a Jewish custom, you ma rry a sister of -- of your
 -- of your wife. I don™t know if that was the 
reason, because on the one hand they were not that
 -- they were not really Orthodox, so it mi ght 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

just be a coincidence, I don™t know
. But he did have two wives, and my father and his -- and two 
brothers came  from one  wife, 
and the other from second wife. 
Q: And your father came from which wife, the first or the second? 
A: From his -- from the first wife. 

Q: From the  first wife. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: So he was one of the -- the older ones. 

Q: Right. And -- 

A: And he worked for a bank, initially, as a --
 I don™t know really in
 what capacity, but he 
worked for a bank. Later on he -- later on he worked
 for my mother™s brother, who come s from a 
well-to-do family and they -- th-they were more -- 
they were more Jewish oriented. They -- they 
were -- in fact, my grandfather on my  mother™s 
side was Orthodox and they orig -- originally 
came from the east, meaning Poland. And -- and so
 my grandfather wasn™t born in Germany. My 
mother already was born in Germany, but that wa
s the other branch of the fa mily, and he had a 
couple of factories and my father worked for my
 mother™s brother and he introduced my mother 
to -- to my father. And that™s how it all came  ab
out, that ™s -- so there 
are two branches to the 
fa mily. 

Q: Really. And what was your fa
ther doing in that business? 
A: And my fatherthen later 
on became a che mis t. He manufactured perfume -- perfume. 
Q: Wa s he trained to do that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
5 
 
A: Yes, he was. He -- he studied chemistry and 
he tied up with a professor who -- and they be -- 
they ma de their own perfume , which was quite su
ccessful, really. And my mother was also very 
enterprising, she had -- sh
e dealt in -- in silver, on a wholesale basis -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- silverware. 

Q: Was that unusual for women to
 be doing that at that time? 
A: I wouldn™t really know, because I was -- 

Q: Because you were a kid. 

A: -- I was rather young then, so I g -- I don™t 
know the background of it a
ll. But that was life 
until -- until I was born, and you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: And by the time wer --  

Q: And your father™s name ?  
A: Wa s Herman.  
Q: And your mother? 

A: First name. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my mother™s name  wa
s Recha, R-e-c-h-a, Recha. 
Q: Right. 

A: Rachel, per se. And -- and -- but she called hers
elf, or they called her Rita, she was known as 

Rita, Rita Goldstei n. 

Q: Right. So when -- when -- 

A: And his name was Herman. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

Q: Right. Do you reme mber wi -- in your childhood, wa
s it a very religious fa
mily, in spite of the 
fact that your father wasn™t raised th
at way, but because of [indecipherabl e] 
A: My father adjusted to -- I would -- I would 
have to put it that way, 
my  father did a good job 
adjusting to -- to my mother™s orientation, re
ligious orientation. And 
she did keep a kosher 
household. And that would take me  to -- to the 
comment that kosher, I 
-- later in my career I 
became very much -- I became very knowledgeable 
along that line and th -- kosher can be -- can 
be ma ny things. Some  people keep kosher insi de their home, while not paying very much 
attention to the law of kashrut, if you will, on the -- on the outside. 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- and -- and -- and that™s where I would 
-- that™s how I would characterize my mother™s 
orientation. My father -- 

Q: Didn™t care. 

A: -- didn™t care, no. He really --
 he really didn™t. That whole pa
rt of the family really did not 
care about the dietary laws.  

Q: So w-would you say that your mo ther™s -- your mo
ther wasn™t really that
 religious, she kept a 
kosher home but she was -- 

A: We ll, she considered herself quite religious
 because she came from a r-rather  -- rather 
religious home , and -- but i-i-if for example she 
were to take a cruise, she would not mi ss out on 
-- on taki ng part in the buffet, and so she could 
-- she had the capability to bend the rules of -- on 
occasion.  

Q: Right. 

A: And the reason I emphasize that is because I --
 la-later on in my career I became a cater er and 
I took over a catering business, which had been 
known as a kosher cate
rer. I changed that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
7 
 
some what in branching out to a more secular 
orientation, I did -- but when doing something in 
the -- in the -- in the synagogue wher
e lifestyle or lifetime events t
ook place, I had to work with a 
ma shgiach under -- under religi
ous supervision, per se.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So I know all about -- about
 that -- I know a lot about that
 -- that particular aspect.  
Q: So, when you were born and growing up, do 
y -- do you reme mber your very early years?  

Was it -- how far -- 

A: Yes, I do -- 

Q: -- how far -- yeah? 

A: I do -- I do have a pretty good recollection of
 a very good home  life and a very norma l life, up 
to the time that -- that  Hitler came to -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- take over the government. 
Q: So, did  
A: That™s when things changed -- 

Q: Changed. 

A: -- drastically -- 

Q: And they [indecipherable] 

A: -- and they changed very rapidly. 

Q: So you do reme mber your years before five 
-- cause you were five years old when he took 
over. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
8 
 
A: Yes. Ye -- when he took over, yes, but things --
 i-in my life, things th -- were fairly normal 
until -- until the -- until past the Ol
ympics, which were in the -- which took place in Berlin in 
1936. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that is where you began to see the signs 
of -- in front of restau
rants, Jews and dogs not 
permitted. And Juden [indecipherable] per se. And 
-- and that became quite obvious to me. Also 
the place where -- parks where I was accustomed 
to playing ha d yellow and green benches, park 
benches, the -- the ones who were -- where Jews 
were permitted to sit were  painted in yellow, 
and they were also inscribed with the sentence 
of Nur für Juden, only for Jews. And the Gentiles 
had green benches. So these -- th
ese little things that started 
around that time  were very obvious. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit beforehand, w-were you 
-- were you close with your mother and your 
father, do you think? 

A: Y-Yes -- 
Q: Do you -- or did you feel closer
 to one more than the other? 
A: We ll, due to circumstances I became  very clos
e to my mother as -- as history ma rched on and 
as things developed in Germany, as we will find 
out a little later in th
is conversation, I -- I 
became much closer to my mother b
ecause I was separated from my father. 
Q: Yeah. But in -- when you were a kid 
and you were together at home until ™39 -- 
A: I made no -- I -- th
ere was no distinction -- 
Q: There™s no distinct -- 

A: -- between my mother and my father, no. 

Q: Did you have -- 

A: I was close to my fat her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

Q: You were? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you have brothers or sist
ers, you were a ch -- only child? 
A: No, the only child. 

Q: The only child. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So did you eat lunches and dinner with your 
par -- I mean, how -- how did meals go with your 
parents? 

A: It was a very -- it was a very normal home life. 
We  did -- we -- yes, we did eat meals together. 

Lunch during the week, from Monday to 
-- to Friday, lunch was at school. 
Q: Oh. 

A: You would take your lunch to 
school in a -- there was the German custom, in a little leather 

pouch, you had your sandwich or what -- or what
ever. And w-with beverages dispensed by the 
school. But lunch was at school. 

Q: And so you ate dinner at home -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- with your parents. 

A: Yes, correct. 

Q: Did your mother cook? 

A: Yes, she did. 

Q: She did? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Was she a good cook? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
10 
 
A: Excellent. 
Q: Yeah? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did you like school? 

A: Yes, I liked -- 

Q: When did you start go -- when -- how
 old were you when you started going? 
A: Probably I would sa
y six or seven.  
Q: Really? 

A: That was first grade, right. 
I in fact reme mber my first da
y in school, and I don™t know if I 
have it here or not, but they just 
did a project in -- in Berlin of 
the fate of -- under the heading -- 
it-it was re -- you would call it a ma
gazine or you could call it a pam
phlet, or a little booklet that 
they put out, that the Berlin 
senate really put out, with th
e caption, the fate of Jewish 
schoolchildren in Berlin. And there™s a picture 
of me  on the -- on the title page. And it was a 
German custom on your first day of school to get a 
cone b -- about three f
eet bi -- long, a cone 
filled with sweets.  

Q: Right. 

A: That was a German cus-custom. We -- 

Q: Right, and you bring th
at to school, right? 
A: And you brought that to school
 and you were photographed with 
that, every -- every child. 
And the first picture on page one -- first of 
all I am on the cover w
ith an unidentified young 
fellow, but the second page had a picture of thesister of Ann Frank. And her name  was Margaret 

Frank, and she held onto one of those -- they -- 
th-they were called -- they were called su -- 
zuckertuete sugar -- sugar cone, 
in translation. And next to her stood a boy -- mi nd you that that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
11 
 
was already past 1933, so Hitler had 
already been in -- firmly entren
ched in -- in the leadership 
of the governme nt. And that boy that stood next 
to her had that sugar cone also, and it 
distinguished that -- it distingui
shed itself by the fact that 
it had the swastika on the cone. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: So it™s a quite interesting pi
cture. The one was like with flow
ers, flowers and gold painted and 
the other cone was a plain white cone  with a black swastika. 

Q: Intere sting. 

A: So -- and that was about the time the Jewish 
teachers were kicked out of the schools and one 
law followed another. The Nurembe r g laws came a
bout and a-all professiona
ls were -- were not 
allowed to practice. Jewish lawyers were disbar
red, judges we re kicked out of the court system 
and dentists and doctors were 
only allowed to treat Jews.  
Q: Henry, what do you rem -- what do you yourself re
me mbe r  as a kid during that time?  Do -- do 
you reme mb er the first time you realized 
that these Nazis were [indecipherable] 
A: Yes. It --  it all --  events we
re developed very, very rapidly in 
the -- in the -- the segr egation of 
the Jewish community, not only in Be rlin, but
 all over Germany. But Berlin -- I emphasize 
Berlin first of all because I lived there. I was born there and I lived there, so I was closest to my 
home town. But the events of discrimination happened
 so fast that a gr eat 
ma ny tried to escape, to 
get away, to get out of Germany. Some  couldn™t, 
and then there were those who were optimists 
by -- by their very nature in -- a
nd hoped that things would even
tually change for the better, 
which of course, it didn™t. And there, at 
that very time, you had -- first of all you had 

Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, which I re
me mber at that time I was ig -- in a -- in a 
Landschuleheim which means a country school, outsi
de of Berlin. And we were a bunch of kids 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
12 
 
playing soccer then the Hitle
r youth came in on that fateful day and besides screaming the 
terrible ep-epitat, or -- or wa -- 
Q: Epithets?  

A: Yeah, yes -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- that -- cursing us Jews a
nd wi-with such things as did you 
-- I don™t want to use any four 
letter words, but did you -- did you not think we 
would come  to you and they chased the kids 
away, walked into the dormitories, threw the fu
rniture out of the window, and created ma ssive 

disruption, which resulted in those 
kids running away, and so did I. Wha t  struck -- what -- what I 

recall vividly, when -- struck me  as
 noteworthy is the fact
 that I -- when I ma de my wa y back to 
my home , my parents™ apartment, but I would be
 unable to tell you how I 
did it. I-I do not recall 
it -- having taken a public means of t r ansportatio
n, I could not tell you in which way I actually -- 
the -- the -- that country place, 
that country home that si -- vry -- that was in Potsdam -- 
Q: Yeah, that™s [indecipherable] 

A: -- which is 20 miles fr om Berlin. 

Q: Right. 

A: And how I ma de it back -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: -- I don™t know. And I can only sa
y that today I have an idea that
 it must have been trauma tic 
event, a -- a very serious disrupti
on in -- in -- in my -- in my way of life, or in my li-lifestyle. 
And it -- it must have touched me  in a way that 
I forgot everyth -- it just
 didn™t da -- the -- the 
details did not exist.  

Q: So you were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
13 
 
A: And my father spent that night on the subway 
because that very same day they had painted all 
the stor es with a huge J, meaning Jew. 
And it also became apparent that along the 
Kurfurstendamm, the main boulevard running through 
Berlin, that every s
econd store really was 
Jewish owned. Every second retail store was Jewi
sh owned, which in -- which again -- I mean, 

which points to the fact that there must ha
ve been among the  population, a fertile ground for 
hatred, jealousy, or whatever you 
want to call it. And the ma s sive 
amount of glass on the streets, 
as evidenced by the name  for that
 particular night, called Kristalln
acht, the night of broken glass, 
if there hadn™t been so ma ny stores that were
 affected, the departme nt stores, you -- you could 
surmise that yes, they were the Jews, German 
Jews were in Berlin were among the mi ddle class 
or upper mi ddle class. They were -- they were
 doing well. They were thriving. And following 
that event of the attack on the Jewish communit
y, that particular which 
fol -- which is known as 
Kristallnacht, the -- they a
rrested 20,000 me n, deported them to Buchenwald, Dachau, 
Sachsenhausen, the surrounding cam
ps. And my father, to avoid arrest, spent the night on the 
subway, the entire night. And 
the Gestapo came to every home and they had -- they knew where 
the Jews lived and arrested ma ny. And we were 
among those who desperatel
y tried to get out of 
Germany, a nd realizing that -- that it was a ma tter 
of life and death, that 
you -- that what would 

follow would be just terribly unbelievable. And 
so we ma naged to get a landing permit, they 
were sold by -- by the Cuban governme nt at the 
time  and we -- our destination had -- had been 
projected to be Cuba -- Havana, to be precise. 
And that occurred, and that
 -- that began the well-
known, documented voyage of the damned.  

Q: Right. 

A: Damned because we were not allowed to
 disembark, we were turned back. And -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
14 
 
A: And from that point -- 
Q: Right, you -- your lif
e changes, clearly. 
A: Clearly. 

Q: Let -- let -- let™s go back a li
ttle bit. When -- when you left
 that school, however you got home 
-- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- I-I understand, you not -- did you knock at 
the door, did you have a key to get in, was your 
mother home, do you reme mber that? 

A: I reme mb er absolutely -- I rea
lly could not tell you any other de
tails. All I know is that I was 
reunited with my -- 

Q: With your fa mily. 

A: -- parents, yes. 

Q: With your parents 
A: With my mother and father. 
Q: Right. Now that -- that was th
e turning point for your fami ly. 
A: Oh absolutely. 

Q: It wasn™t ni -- it wa
sn™t 1933, it wasn™t 1935 -- 
A: No, it was ni -- 

Q: -- it was 1938. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Right. 

A: Exactly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
15 
 
Q: Is there -- I-I -- I™ve been to
ld that there was an incident 
with an SS who painted a J on your 
forehead, is that true? 
A: It was not an SS, it w -- it -- I had had my 
birthday around that time , in -- in 1938, and prior to 
-- to that date, on or around that date, I -- my
 playmates were -- were Gentile vo -- largely 
Gentile boys in my neighborhood, which was a str
eet running off the Kurfurstendamm, it was a 
good mi ddle class neighborhood and we were a group of
 kids who played. And one of the kids -- 
I -- I had gotten a ball point pen, which I™m not sure
 if it was a Montblanc, or what type of pen, 
but it was a ball point pen, which at the time had 
the -- and was called in Germany an Tintenkuli. 
And that™s the wa -- the name  they had for this
 new innovation, a b -- a ball point pen. Prior to 

that time ball point pens were re
latively unknown. It was some thing th
at just oc -- developed at -- 
at -- around -- on or around that tim
e. And he took -- one of the boys
 took that pen and wrote on 
my forehead not only a J, but the entire word, Jude, J-u-d-e. So -- 

Q: And this was one of your friends? 
A: One of my playma tes. 
Q: One of your playma tes. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Wa s this shocking to you? 

A: I -- my sentiment or my precise emotions 
or my feelings, if you 
will, I -- I -- I do not 
recollect. I -- I have no r
ecollection. But I could assume  
that it was very shocking.  
Q: I would imagine. 

A: I mean my -- my guess would be that 
-- that it was extremely shocking, yes. 
Q: Did the -- did the Gentile fr
iends that -- you had ma inly Gent
ile friends, wa -- playma tes -- 
A: I had ca -- I had Jewish fr
iend and I had Gentile friends. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
16 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: In my i mme diate neighborhood I also had -- we
 were quite -- th-the -- there was no great 
separation between the racial bac
kground of the -- the kids. It -- it 
wa -- wasn™t very obvious. As 
a ma tter of fact there was a 
-- there was a fine rapport betw
een Gentile and Jew up to the 
propaganda that was ril -- that 
poisoned the mi nds of the people. 
Q: And whe n -- 

A: And there was a propaganda th
at was directed by the governme nt. 
Q: Right. 

A: In a -- in a way that the yout
h in particular, that the school 
system used propaganda to poison 
the mi nds of the people in the [indecipherable]  

Q: Do you reme mber when it seeme d to change, when the kids seemed -- when the Gentile kids 

seemed to not want to play with you?  Wa s 
that very late?  Wa s that 1938, or do you think it 
happened earlier? 
A: That was rather -- I would 
say it was around that time , 1938. 
Q: It was around that time . 
A: But shortly thereafter we were -- it wasn™t ve
ry long before we actually embarked on the SS 
Saint Louis, the -- th
e well known ship -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- that carried 937 German Jews 
to the intended 
destination -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- which was Cuba and -- and resulted in a --
 in a dramatic voyage, really [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
17 
 
Q: Do -- do you reme mb er it -- wi
 -- did your parents talk to you 
about they were getting these 
landing visas, the visas for Cuba or did they just
 say pack your little bag and we™re going?  Wa s it 
-- do you reme mber? 
A: Well, I think that it was a -- a policy by most 
parents to avoid involving
 children in -- in the 
pressure or in the tension that -- that existed at the time. And so the detail
s of the -- of what went 
on is -- is not foremost in my me mory. 

Q: Okay. We™re going to change the tape.

Q: Tell me  about your schooling. 
A: We ll, as I was saying, upon returning from th
a t  country school where -- where I had been 
while my pa rents were -- went through the very
 serious emotion of liquidating our household -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to the point where -- to th
e point they were permitted to -- to take some things along with 
them -- and the businesses were confiscated an
yway before that, they were -- your personal 
wealth already by that time  had been confis
cated by the -- by the Nazi government. And the 
school I went to was also in the same  neighbor
hood, so to speak. It was a Jewish public school 
adjacent to a synagogue. And -- so you could say 
that the school and the synagogue were one 
and the same . It was a pa rochial school, if you will. And on that very sa me day of Kristallnacht 

that -- they burned that synagogue
 to the ground. And so was the 
school. So we actually were 
without a synagogue, we were without a school, a
nd the -- the holy -- like 
the Torahs were piled 
up on -- and the prayer books were 
piled up on the street and set on fire, burned. And -- and that 
happened all over Germany. On that particul
ar day 600 synagogues were burned to the ground. 
And I mi ght add for accuracy and historical deta
il that it was in response -- it was a fake 
response, a fa bricated response, because they pr
obably would have done it anyway, that -- that 
those terrible, anti-Semitic acts were governme nt 
orient  -- were instigate
d, but it ha ppened that a 
young Jewish ma n assassinated a German councilo
r official. And by the end -- by the end -- his 
name  was bi -- his name  was Greenspan. And 
-- and so the German government to -- in 
retaliation, quote unquote, in retaliat
ion set these events in mo tion. 
And -- and that™s so much for 
that. 

Q: Did you hear about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
19 
 
A: Did I hear about that? 
Q: Then, then. Or did you only 
hear about that later on? 
A: I -- it is hard to di fferentiate between what I h
eard and what I read. That™s
 an evid -- that ™s self 
evident. 

Q: Right. 

A: It is an inevitable truth that some  details we
re perhaps too heavy and too -- too farfetched for 
a 10 year old to fully comprehend. So my 
guess would be that 
-- that I read it. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It™s a historical fact.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: But the infor mation, per se came  to me  through the me dia.  

Q: So your parents did not say to you you were 
going to Cuba, as far as you reme mb er, in terms 
of the preparations. 
A: Don™t reme mber. 
Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: No, I -- I don™t -- 

Q: Do you reme mber anxiety in the house?  Do
 you reme mbe r  people do
ing all sorts of -- 
A: Oh yes, absolutely. Oh yeah, absolutely. Ever
ything was being packed, the overseas, the cert -
- certain thing we were allowed to take some  thi
ngs with us and -- and th
-that we were about to 
leave became apparent . And -- 

Q: We re you able to pack a little bag for yourself? 

A: Yes, of course. 

Q: Do you reme mber what you packed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
20 
 
A: No, I don™t exactly reme mber, 
but I probably -- I could only 
guess that I packed the things 
that were, at that time, at that
 point in time, important to me. 
Q: But you don™t reme mber what they were? 

A: No. 

Q: No. So did you have a little bag, a satchel, what did you have?  Do you reme mber?  It was a 

little -- 

A: Could have been a rucksack -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- a backpack -- 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: -- most likely. 

Q: We re your parents fairly wealthy at 
this time , so they could afford this? 
A: I would not characterize them as wealthy, but 
compared to the genera
l population, they were 
certainly mi ddle class, or upper mi ddle class. In t
hose days everything was a little bit -- I would -
- I wouldn™t hesitate to say low key. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And in no way comp arable to -- to what 
is commonplace today. And that pertains to -- to 

sports, to just about everything, I mean -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- we have the means of communi cation, it -- 
i -- those were two, not only -- we™re not only 

talking about 50 or 60 years, we™re 
talking about two different worlds. 
Q: Mm. Did you take a taxi to
 the boats?  Do you -- do you re
me mber how you got there?   
A: I reme mb er that we went to the station 
by train and traveled to Hambur g on a train. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
21 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And so all this stuff that was being 
taken was -- was shipped separately -- 
A: Exactly --  

Q: -- so you just [indecipherable] 

A: -- it was taken -- it was ta
ken -- it was moved by -- tran
spor ted to -- to the ship. 
Q: Right. 

A: How -- how exactly the -- the details of how ther
e were suitcases -- it wasn™t really a whole 
lot -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- that you were permitted to -- to take along. 

Q: Did you have to say goodbye to anybody, 
or did -- was this
 all in secret? 
A: No, no, you could say -- you could say goodbye to just whomever you -- you pleased, you 
know. 
Q: And did you?  Do you reme mber ? 

A: No, no, no specific recollection, r
eally. The -- the only thing that
 I, from that period that 
stands out is the fact that we arrived in Ha m
burg and -- and we nt into a big hall where tables 
were set up with custom officers who would 
stamp your passport as -- as surrendering your 
citizenship and so forth and so on, and boarding th
e ship, which was a former cruise -- cruise 
liner . 

Q: Cruise liner. Your -- did you liv
e in an apartment or a house? 
A: In an apartment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
22 
 
Q: Wa s that rented, or you just -- your fa mily 
just left it? Did they own it?  Do you -- do you have 
any recollection? 
A: No, I do not know if they owned it, but 
most apartments I believe were rented.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think. 

Q: So you think they just left and then whoever 
was the landlord just took over again. You didn -
- but you™re not sure. 

A: Yeah -- no. I went back there some -- many, many years later. I wa
s invited by the city 

governme nt as a guest. I was invited in Berlin an
d -- and of course I took 
a stroll to -- it was 
within walking distance. We stayed in the -- th
ey put us up in the Hotel Kempinski, which was 
one of the better hotels, to say th
e very least, and gave us the r
oyal treatme nt. They kicked us out 
in 1939 and invited us with -- with every kind of 
amenity to visit and showed us the city and the 

approach to Judaism, which had sa --
 changed 360 degrees, so to speak.  
Q: So you went -- you we nt b
ack to your old neighborhood -- 
A: And I went back to my old neighborhood and --
 and I went to the old apartment, which had a 
balcony and -- and I knocked on the door, rang the hous
e bell. And of course the response of the 
owners was quite -- was quite inte
resting, they demonstr
ated a kind of -- I would a -- I would say 
a kind of fear -- unfounded, totally 
unfounded fe ar that I came back
 toreclaim my former home. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because all of the home s that were -- that were
 vacated by Jews who either left Germany in -- 

in the ni ck of time -- war broke out and after that  there was n -- emigration was totally 

impossible. Anybody who was still caught
 in the trap was ultimately de
ported to -- to the a -- to 
the east. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
23 
 
Q: Right. 
A: To -- to Theresienstadt, which was in Czechos
lovakia, a camp where a lot of German Jews 
were housed, and -- or -- or sent 
to Poland to -- to -- to the deat
h camps. And so these hi -- these 
apartments and all of the property that Jews on
ce owned was stolen, if you will. And so were the 
what -- who -- who -- and the apartments were 
-- and the houses and th
e villas and the homes 
were auctioned off to anyone who was permitted to 
take part in the auction. Books were written 
on the subject. 

Q: So these people, when you went to vi
sit, were afraid. Did they let you in? 
A: Exactly, they were afraid. Yeah, they let me  
into the foyer and -- and 
I pointed out that they 
had this -- through this hallway you come  to the 
kitchen, and off the hallw
ay is the living room, 
to your left. And they were quite stunned by my
 me mory as to their 
own home , the layout of 
their own home. 

Q: Right. 
A: And it was -- to me it was a slightly -- it wa
sn™t so very dramatic, it was more a -- more 
amusing in -- in a -- in a -- in a certain sense.
 Although I was touched emotionally la -- in seeing 
my old home. 
Q: Yes, I can imagine. 

A: Naturally, but -- 

Q: Did they let you get beyond the foyer, or
 did they -- did they not want you -- 

A: I ma de no effort and they 
did really not invite me  to -- 

Q: Okay. I see. 

A: -- on the -- on the grand tour because their hous
e or their apartment, their residence was not 
on the market for -- for -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
24 
 
Q: Right. 
A: They had no intention of selling it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and I had no intention of buying it. 

Q: Henry, what was your first impression when
 you saw the luxury liner, the Saint Louis? 
A: Oh, that was amazing. I was 10 and a half year
s old and I™d never seen a huge ship like that, 
and it was a very big ship. And, in fact it wa
s owned by the Ha mburg-Am
erica line and it -- it -- 
it had been used for pleasure cruises up to that
 time . And the captain, Gustav Schroeder was his 
name , turned out to be a very civil and -- and ya
 -- a wonderful human be ing, to say the least. He 
demonstrated a -- a feeling of huma ne -- he did 
not return a -- a -- upon ou
r -- our attempt to find 
a place to -- to -- where we coul
d la -- where -- di sembark, and when
 that didn™t come to be, he 
delayed the departur e for Europe as long as he co
uld. And finally, ultimately, at the end of it all, 
he -- he -- they pronounced him as 
one of the Righteous Gentiles a
nd that™s history, and planted a 
tree for him in -- in Israel. So he was quite a ma n. 

Q: What was your room like?
 You -- did you st -- you st
ayed with your parents? 
A: Yeah, in a cabin. In a very, very -- 

Q: Was it nice -- it was 
nice? You reme mber? 
A: Yes, it -- it -- it was as ni
ce as tourist class was, economy cl
ass was during that period. We  did 
not -- 

Q: Did you have a good time on the ship, or was the sh -- 

A: Excellent. No, I -- w-we played. We played game s. 

Q: A lot of kids. 

A: Yeah. Th-There were qu
ite a few children on board.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
25 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And we played game s. It was a -- it was a -- 
a joyful occasion. For the 
adults I would say it w 
-- they -- they tried to make the adults as comfortabl
e as the -- as the -- th 
-- as -- as they could. 
The-There were movies on board and there were -- 
there was a gala dinner, festivities of ca -- 
some  kind. Th-That was on the way over, on the way 
back it was traumatic. Bu
t the first half of 

the voyage was one of pleasant anticipation. Alth
ough I must say the adults were -- had mi xed 
feelings. The -- as an adult,
 to leave your home behind, your 
culture and all that you were 
accustomed to beside  your possessions, it was a --
 th-they -- they were touched in a totally 
different way than the children. 

Q: This affected you, I gather. You could feel it. 

A: You could feel the tension that -- 

Q: Among t he adults. 

A: -- that prevailed, yes. Those we
re not norma l times, by any means. 
Q: Did you a -- you as a child, with the other kids 
that you we re playing with, did you ever talk 
about it, or -- or this was not part of the discussion?  Do you reme mber ha -- 
A: Among us children? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No, but from what I -- I was told that there 
wa -- there were game s whi c h related to the time s 
that we were living in. One part
icular game  was one where they 
separated th-the kids into two 
groups. One was a Gentile group, the other one wa -- all the -- all of them were Jewish. They 

separated them and they created a scenario by wa
y of which they -- they 
-- the -- they reflected 
what was going on in -- in -- in Germany.  

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
26 
 
A: In the -- in the way of drastic separation of the -- of the races. 
Q: So that must have been difficult. I mean, even the game  wa sn™t funny.  

A: No, it was not really -- it wa
s not really funny. There were -- 
Q: Which -- which -- 

A: -- I didn™t [indecipherable] 

Q: -- do you reme mber which side you were at? 

A: No. 

Q: You know -- you know -- you -- 

A: No, no, I -- well, not really. And we -- we di
d other things. There wa
s a swimmi ng pool, we -- 
we swa m it. There were lots of game s  for kids an
d the -- the -- the first ha
lf of the voyage went -- 
until we ar rived in Havana, it was quite interesting.  

Q: And whe r e did you eat?  Did you eat with kids
, or did you eat with 
the adults? Did you eat 
with your parents?  Do you reme mber ? 
A: I sat at a table with my parents -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and we ate in gr oups of fa milies, just as a 
-- just as a cruise ship would be operated, yeah.  
Q: There was no school -- there was 
schooling for kids on the ship -- 
A: No, absolutely not. 

Q: -- that was just fun. 

A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And the trip
 over lasted, I believe, 10 days -- 
Q: And whe n you -- and did you -- 

A: -- from Hamburg to Atlanta. 

Q: -- did you understand that you we re supposed to get off at Havana? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
27 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: You did understand that? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Cause you were old enough by then, you were 10 and a half, so you had some thing -- 

A: Yeah, well, it wasn™t so much the age as -- 
as the fact that suitcases were being packed and 
they were put out in front of the cabins for 
remo val. There wa s no doubt in anyone™s mi nd that 
this was a point of debarkation and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and the entire events that took pl ace supported 
that idea that we were at
 our dest -- point of 
destination. 

Q: Right. 

A: The people stood on the deck, on top deck, look
ed down at the -- at the ocean, at the water 
and from the shore of -- of Havana, little boats 
with family members who had preceded the Saint 
Louis, they came to greet their relatives on -- on 
board. And ma  -- I had an uncle and an aunt and 
my cousin, who left Germany two 
weeks prior to the Saint Louis 
on a ship called the Iberia. And 
that ship carried 250 passengers. 
And their life and their future 
turned out to be completely 
different than -- than ours, which was name d the voyage of the damned. They were far from 

damned bec a use they -- 

Q: They disembarked? 

A: -- lived -- they lived -- they disembarked, they
 lived a year in Havana and waited for their -- 
their quota. America had a quota system for ne
w i mmi grants and when their numbe r came up, 
they immi grated to the United Stat es in a perfectly
 legal ma nner. And so they stayed just shortly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
28 
 
here in Havana, and then -- then moved the -- th
e 90 miles to the shores of the United States. 
And their life then turned -- my cousin joined 
the army, and he became an American soldier. 
Q: Right. 

A: And my uncle, who had been in the jewelry 
business in Germany, he became a representative 
for a watch company. They lived in a small town 
in Beaumont, Texas -- Beaumont, Te xas, and -- 
and later on they moved to New York. And my 
cousin, who had been under the G.I. Bill of 
Rights became  a watchmaker. And so they had a 
very norma l -- normal future ahead of them, 
until we ourselves were reunited with th
em in 1947, at the end of World War II. 
Q: So what was that like, that sort of 
suspension in Havana on the Saint Louis -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- where -- where you couldn™t get off, alt
hough there™s -- there™s one suicide, right? 
A: Well, that  was -- that was a dramatic turni
ng point. To begin with there was the hope, the 
persistent hope that if we don™
t get off the ship today, due to 
some admi nistrative technicality, 
we would be -- we would be allowed to get off to
morrow. It -- it should be -- I should not fail to 
mention that the Hapag-America line, the Ha
mb urg-America line, the shipping comp any did 
compel the passengers to pay for a return ticket, b
ecause we did not have authentic visas, as the -
- the entry permit is known --is -- is known today. 
We did not have a -- a re
sident visa, we had a 
landing permit. And -- which was sold by a Minister
 of Immi gration. And th
at, in the political 
arena, resulted in a jealous confrontation betw
een various segments in the Cuban governme nt, 
and the ultima te rejection of -- 
of the -- of the passengers to di
sembark. And so when then went 
past another day, and the American Jewish organiza
tions used their -- tried to use their infl uence 
to some how have Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 
F.D.R. as he was known, to -- to admit the 
passengers, which he failed to do, had he known th
at two-thirds of the passengers would end up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
29 
 
in gas an-and g -- be gassed in -- in the death camps of Pola nd and Auschwitz and Majdanek and 
Treblinka and so on, he ma y have -- in my view, 
he ma y have  had -- taken a different sort of 
action. As it was, he -- he refused. In fact he
 ma rked a note with the comment, no action. He 
turned back every effort to allow these people 
to disembark. He and his 
admi nistration sent the 
937 victims to -- for most of
 them, to their death. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And the ship ultima tely appealed to Canada, 
to -- to every country in
 the world for asylum 
and the response throughout the world was the same
, in th -- terms of 
not allowing these people 
into their respective countries. And this is pr ec
isely the reason that the Saint Louis became a -- a 
world event. Not in the same  way as the Titani
c, because the Titanic wa
s sunk by an iceberg and 
the Saint Louis was sent back to Europe for an 
uncertain fate of their passengers by reason of 
politics and racial -- racial c
onfrontation and discrimi nation.  
Q: There™s a -- a report that the 
children wrote a letter to
 Eleanor Roosevelt from the ship. We re -
- were you part of that, or you didn™t know -- 

A: Not that at -- not that I, in 
all honesty, not that I reme mbe r  -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- but it was quite possible,
 but I do not reme mber that. 
Q: You don™t reme mber. And she also didn™t answer, as far as -- 

A: I me t Mrs. Roosevelt [indecipherable] 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes, I me t her personally, which was -- si
nce you me ntioned that, and had you interviewed 
me  at that time , or had you pushed the cloc
k -- we re we able to push the clock back -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
30 
 
A: -- a number of years, I probably -- I ma y have 
just asked her that question. But I did not speak 
to her about the Saint Louis, but
 I met her. And I met her and she had an apartment in the Park 
Sheraton Hotel in New York City. 
Q: Right. 

A: And she stayed in the towers, and during my 
stay in -- which is probably going to come  here 
and we™re going to probably going to touch on 
that, in switzer -- we ended up in Switzerland 
ultimately. Not being able to do -- to disembark 
in Cuba, the ship going back to Europe, we 

ended up ultima tely by -- by way off other even
ts, we ended up in Switzerland and I attended -- 
some where in time I attended hotel school. And havi
ng had this hotel experience, I we nt to the 
Park Sheraton Hotel in search of a position. And th
e general manager told me that it is the policy 
of the hotel to promote people from within the ho
tel, from within ranks of the hotel, and then -- 
then he asked his assistant, the assistant ma nager, he asked him, he says, how did you start here, 

to refresh his me mory. So he said well, I started as
 an elevator operator. And this resulted in my 
working at the Park Sheraton Hotel as an elevator
 operator, and my passenge
r in that -- in -- in 
my -- 

Q: Was Eleanor -- 

A: -- was Eleanor Roosevelt, because she lived on top of the 25
th
 floor and I had a job to take the 
elevator from the 25
th
 to the 30
th
 floor, consequently I saw her every day. 
Q: So did -- you never told her you had been on the Saint Louis? 

A: No. 

Q: Interesting.  

A: No, I did not -- 

Q: So she never knew your history? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
31 
 
A: No, I did not do that because I felt that as an
 employee of the hotel, you just did not -- you di d 
not create a personal relationshi
p of that kind with your -- with
 your passengers. I -- I met many 
fa mous people and -- throughout my career, and 
-- and I me t the Duke and Duchess of Wi ndsor 
at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Soda Springs, wher
e I ha d worked as a -- as a sous chef, as a 
cook, if you will, and I did not ask the Duke of Wi nds
or if he really was a friend of Adolf Hitler, 
which later on reading books it became  --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- apparent that he was a great sympathizer of
 the Nazi regime , prior 
to Britain entering the 
war, of course. But he was, and the House of 
Wi ndsor, the -- and -- and 
-- and the -- and the 
[indecipherable] that was a relatio
nshi p between the German aristo
cracy of the -- of the time and 
so on. But I did not discuss any of that. 

Q: Right. What was it like on the trip back? 

A: We ll, in Havana one
 ma n jumped overboard. 
Q: Right. 

A: He lost his head, he lo -- he
 despaired, and in desp
eration he jumped overboard, cut his wrists. 
So you can imagine that panic ensued. When -- 
when it became  apparent that we could not 
disembark, that the ship may ha -- may have to
 go back to Europe, back to Germany. Some  
people already had been in concentration camps a
nd the feeling was one of
 utter panic. And the 
return voyage was very -- even -- even I as a 
young child realized the te
nsion that existed. They 
wanted to capture the bridge -- and when I say 
bridge, I™m not talking about a card game , I™ m 
talking about th-the -- the place where th-the co
mmand of the ship took place, where the captain 
and -- and his first and second officers and the inst
rume nts were located, that guided the ship to 
its destination. And the ship wa
s a -- was on course for Europe. 
And organizations were still -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
32 
 
on a daily basis there we re announcements that 
came over the ship radio that this and this 
occurred, this and this happened, and hope was give
n to -- to the passengers that they would find 
a country that would ultima tely 
admit them. And so it was that ju
st shortly be -- they had even 
planned to scuttle, if that™s th
e right word, to run the ship ag
round in the English channel, and 
thus set the ship on fire to -- to save -- to pr
event people from having to return to Germany, and 
perhaps find -- find England receptive to -- to take  
these pe ople in. And it wasn™t necessary to do 
that because shortly before entering the North Se
a, German territorial wa
ters, four countries -- 
four countries accepted the -- gave  asylum to 200 
and some  of the passengers. And those four 
countries were, Belgium, Holland, France and England. 
Q: We  -- I™m afraid we have to st
op, and we™ll conti
nue it fro m there. 
A: Good. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Do you know who -- who negotiated with
 these four countri
es to allow -- 
A: Yes, there was one fellow, as a ma tter of fact
 the Holocaust Museum has a picture of it, his 
name  was Troper, T-r-o-p-e-r. He was one of the 
negotiators. And then th
e various organizations 
like the Joint, J-o-i-n- t, Joint. Th-The -- we
™ve got HIAS, ORT and [indecipherable] ORT, O-R-
T. 
Q: Right. 

A: Various Jewish organizations
 that operated in New York a
nd -- and so on. They -- they all 
tried to motivate countries and governments to -- 
to accept. And then we were given asylum and 
-- and then of course the times, everything turn
ed into a di saster, into a pathetic set of 
circumstances that resulted in the gassing of tw
o-thirds of the passengers
 and a total disruption 
for the rema ining people. It -- it was just simply
 too -- too much to even
 reflect upon. It -- we -- 
the French history throughout World Wa r II was a so
rry state of affairs. 
France was partitioned 
in the va -- France granted asylum, and the -- th
e French governme nt quick
ly changed with the -- 
war started shortly after 
our de-debarkation. And -- 
Q: What -- let me ask you something, i-if I can 
interrupt. Why did you decide -- did you decide 
to go to France, or were -- was that a decision made for you? 

A: You could -- you could give a preference. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Which in some  cases was adhered to, or was me t,
 and in other cases they just -- you were just 
assigned to a country. If I™m not 
mi staken, my mother spoke some
 Frenc h, and my fa ther, having 
been a chemist and created a perfume, and France
 being a le -- a -- a l
eader in the world of 
perfume, in -- in that particular [indecipherable]
 of -- that it could be 
possible that -- I do not

know for sure whether we  requested, or whether 
we got there by chance. All I know is that we 
finally th -- that people -- the boat went to --
 to -- to Holland, Belgium, and we debarked in 
Bologne, which was Bologne, well, which was -- 
which was France. And my father never saw 
freedom again, he was interned as an -- as an al
ien, and he was interned 
in one or two different 
camps. 
Q: You me a n he was interned by the French? 

A: By the French. France was split into two part
s, into -- one pa rt was under German occupation 
and conseque ntly a ve ry early and fast policy of
 seclusion, der -- of anti-Semitic decrees, one 
after the other [indecipherable] th-the telephonebooth is -- you were not
 allowed to ma ke long 
distance telephone calls, a
nd you had to wear the jew -- by that
 time you had to wear the Jewish 
star and so forth and so on. And -- and the ot
her half was the non-occ
upied zone, run by the 
Vichy governme nt, under the leadership of Marshal 
Pétain, who was a hero in World Wa r I. He -
- he distinguished hims elf at the Battle of Ver
dun. He -- in -- in world -- ™14 - ™18, the world -- 
first World War. He wa s a hero during that period. 

Q: You me a n 19 -- 1918. 

A: We ll, I mean, a -- 

Q: You said 1418. 

A: Yeah, 14 -- 

Q: 19 -- 

A: -- to 19. 1914 to 1918. 

Q: Ah, really, okay. 

A: And -- and he -- he was anti-Semitic, that -- th
at regi me, with Laval, L-a-v-a- l Laval, they 
were fascist. They were without
 any question of a doubt of the sa
me  sentiment as Mussolini, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
35 
 
were definitely allied -- allied with the axis 
with -- with Germany, and e nforced decrees that 
completely isolated and separated Jew -- the Je
ws . And -- and what followed was just a total 
disaster. They arrested the Jews in 1942 in c
onjunction with the s -- 
with the solving, quote 
unquote of the Jewish question, the -- the -- the big 
problem as to what to
 do with the Jews, the 
Final Solution. And anyone who ever has the opport
unity to -- to hear th
at phrase, the Final 
Solution, need only put it into the internet 
browser and th -- you get 20 pages detailing the 
conference on Wa nnsee, which is outside of Berlin, a villa where the SS big shots, Eichma nn, 
Hi mmler, Heydrich and Rosenberg and all these peopl
e, 15 in total, me t, who were in charge of 
ultimately transporting and killing those Jews who we
re still alive, and eliminating Jews fr om the 
face of Europe, which -- which -- which indeed happened.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And -- and my father was sent to Gurs, a hell
hole. If there ever was a hellhole, that was one, 
on the -- 
Q: Now he™s in southern France, southern -- 
A: In si -- in -- near the Spanish border. 

Q: Right. And you and your mother go -- 

A: And we and my mother were free. My mother
 was completely free by Fr ench or by fren -- by 
the -- by the French rules of the time, she was free
. And I was sent, with al
l of the kids from the 
Saint Louis to a children home  run by the ORT 
and [indecipherable]. And 
that children home  
was outside of Paris, about 25 kilome ters from Pa
ris, and they had a big banner, welcome to the 
children of the Saint Loui s. And to me, it was one of the worst times in my  life, because  -- 

Q: Why now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
36 
 
A: -- I had never been separated from my parents,not even during the worst time s in -- in Berlin 
prior to immigrating, and I was se
parated from my parents, which to me  was very painful. And I 
stayed a few months in that home, along with 
the other children. And th
en my mother managed 
to get me to join her. My mother and I lived in
 a very, very small hotel. I had the occasion as a 
tourist to see that pl ace a number 
of years later, and I was appalle
d because it had not been in my 
me mory, what -- what  I -- what I saw. It was li
ke a -- a little dump. A ve
ry, very small hotel in 
the -- not far fr om the Follies Bergèr e, in 
the -- in Bon Nuvella, th
at™s a si -si -- a -- a 
[indecipherable] in the -- in the 
opera in -- in -- in Pa
ris. And we lived in Paris for a few months, 
and my mother ma naged. I wished I had the opport
unity -- well, I lost her, she passed away and 
why -- I would -- would have loved to ask how she ma
naged to get us the papers to -- to go to the 

non-occupied zone, which we were 
able to leave Paris for Nice.  
Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. 

A: So we have done the French Riviera. 
Q: Right. Was sh -- was she in 
Le Man, or was she actually -- 
A: In Le Man. 
Q: Now, that™s fairly far from Paris, though. 

A: 200 kilome ters. 

Q: Right. 

A: From Paris. 

Q: So -- 

A: We stayed there, in a small house. 

Q: You stayed there -- that™s where you were staying. 

A: That™s where we were 
staying until we -- we -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
37 
 
Q:  Left  for Ni ce. 
A: And still that™s now --
 war had already started. 
Q: Right. 

A: The Germans has already occupied half of France. 

Q: Right [indecipherable] 1940. 

A: And that happened right around the time -- ov
ernight you had Dunkirk and the English who 
had been in Le Man disappeared in the mi ddle of
 the night, abandoned th
eir barracks and headed 
for Dunkirk, part of Wor l d Wa r II and -- and went
 to -- and then escaped. Hitler was slow in 
ma king up his mi nd, he mi ssed the boat, so to speak, and -- in more ways than one. He mi ssed 

many boats because the troops, the English troops, 
by any me ans, went from Dunkirk back to -- 
into the ma inland, to England, and thus escap
ed. And there were more than 250,000 of them. 
And that turned the war into th
e battle -- and that turned the 
war into the battle for England. 
Ultimately what followed was Pearl Harbor and the 
entry of America into the war. We  went to 
Nice, to the French Riviera and lived there 
for a little more than
 a year and a half. 
Q: Let me  go back. Now wi -- did -- you -- you were
 only at this school, 
the Ozay sker -- school 
for a few months -- 

A: A few months. 

Q: -- before your mother got you. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Di-Did you have classes there, or 
you didn™t have classes?  Do you remember? 
A: As I recall, we had classes, yes. We had classes and -- and we lived a fairly -- fairly norma l 

life except it was war and we carried gas ma sks. 

Q: Oh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
38 
 
A: And there were air raids. The German bomb
ers -- the -- the -- there was a war on and Paris 
was declared an open city and consequently
 it wa s occupied. France surrendered. Belgium, 
Holland and -- Belgium, Holla
nd capitulated in 24 hours. 
Q: Right. 
A: And the passengers who had been assigned to 
those two countries fell
 into the Nazi hands, 
which -- which ma rked them -- which guaranteed -- 
sealed their -- their fate, marked them for 
extermination. That was as good as -- 

Q: But that didn™t happen with you and your mot her. 

A: No, that didn™t ha ppen, because 
we went to the non-occupied zone, and in the aftermath of the 
so-called Wannsee Conference, the 
solution of the final question, of the Jewish question, they -- 
from that point on, the speed with which Europe
an Jewry was arrested and sent to the camps, 
that went so fast, a-as -- as to
 reflect the -- the industrial talent
 and the great capacity of Ger many 
to -- to manufacture the best of the best in term
s of cars, that™s how they ma naged to deport the -- 
and with the cooperation of the French. The -- 
the French co-op -- would -- not only cooperated, 
but they were instrume ntal in -- in the shi
pping of their own native -- 70,000 native Jews were 
arrested and shipped to Auschwitz, along with al
l of the ma ny immi grants who had found refuge 
and so-called asylum. They were all sent to -- and 
this fellow, just as we -- most of us know of 
Simon Wiesenthal, there was a counterpart in Fr
ance, Serge Klarsfeld who documented the fate 
of -- of the French -- of the Jewish immigrants a
nd the French and so forth. My father would di -- 
would -- became  a -- I have a letter he
re that st ates in detail that my father was last -- he™d seen -- 
deported from Gurs, they liquidated that camp as  
-- that  I had described as
 a hellhole because it -
- you walked in mud. You -- the food was insuffic
ient. If there was any food, it was insufficient. 
And you slept on straw, th-the hygiene, the circum
stances were awful. And the transport -- my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
39 
 
father was deported on the 10
th
 of August 1942, to Auschwitz, a
nd on French trains. And it was 
later established thatthe SS paid a certain amount of mone
y for each passenger on those trains, 
on the French cattle wagons that took 
their -- their passengers to Auschwitz. 
Q: So this -- 

A: And there was all ste -- a 
hundred people to one car, without
 seats, standing room only, 
resulting in the death of a -- 
of quite a few people before th
ey even arrived. You know -- 
Q: Did you ever see your father again -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- after you left  the Saint Louis? 

A: No. 

Q: You never did. Did your mother ever see him?  

A: Ah, no. No, we never saw him a gain. 

Q: And do you have any idea why your mother c
hose Nice?  Why go to Ni
ce?  There was a large 
Jewish community there, I gather, but -- 

A: There was a large Jewish community there. 

Q: Do you think that™s why? 

A: And was that -- there was a larg
e Jewish community there and -- 
Q: And was it under the Italians at 
that point, when your mother came? 
A: No, it -- it was not. It was under -- under 
French domi n -- domi nion. And -- it was under 
French dominion and Nice was a destination and -- 
and some  of her friends from -- originally 
from Berlin also were in Nice. And I had a --  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- I celebrated my Bar Mitzvah in Nice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
40 
 
Q: Yeah, I understand that. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Let me go back just  a little bit. 

A: Please. 

Q: D -- how did you get to Nice, by train? 

A: Yes. 

Q: That you reme mber? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mber the train 
trip?  It was a long trip. 
A: Yes. 

Q: From Paris, yes? 

A: Yes. But what I reme mber even more was the f
act that we went into hi
ding as -- as the -- the 
great arrests took place in Paris a
nd all over France, in -- in respons
e to the decision taken at -- in 
Wannsee a-as part of the conference -- 

Q: So you were in hiding in Paris -- 

A: -- the Fi nal Solution --   

Q: We re you in -- 

A: -- we were hiding with a Gentile family in an attic. 

Q: In Paris? 

A: In -- in Nice. 

Q: In Nice. But let™s go back 
to the beginning when you were in Nice, cause you were in Nice 
for a -- two years, do you think? 

A: About -- a little more 
than a year and a half. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
41 
 
Q: Little mo re than a year, I see. So -- 
A: Of which part of the time  I was in hiding at -- 

Q: Right, now -- 

A: -- from t hat point on. 

Q: -- but in the beginning, where -- did you live in
 an apartment with you
r mother?  I mean, how 
did you -- how did you get along? Did you go to work? 

A: We  lived in a very, very small hotel. 

Q: Mm. 

A: Which you could call a rooming house. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And you would tell they catered mainly to pe
rmanent residents. And we had one room. I sh -- 
I would characterize it as 
a large closet. It had a bed, it had a 
small round table, the size of this 
table here. It had a small closet, 
it had two chairs, and that was it. 
Q: That was it. 

A: And that™s where we stayed until we we
re right -- until we went into hiding. 
Q: Did your mother work? 

A: No. 

Q: So how did she have money to pay for the hotel, do you reme mber? 

A: Y-Yes. We had friends in Switzerland who 
were associated during peace time  wi th my 
uncle™s factories. They had -- and these friends 
had two departme nt stores. They were -- they 
were of means, they were well-to-do. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
42 
 
A: And they sort of supported us, with limited 
pocket money or funds. And it -- it was by way of 
charity that we existed for -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- a little more than a year, for a year and a half. 

Q: Before you went into hiding, was it fairly comf
ortable in Nice?  I mea
n, did you feel safe in 
some  way, or not? 

A: For a period of time, I -- ec -- except for mi
ssing my father and living a -- an -- a life of -- 
getting used to another lifestyle, 
I would say that -- that it -- it
 was -- until the -- the big raffles, 
the big arrests, it was quite comfortable. 

Q: And you -- you went to school? 

A: Yes. I went to elementary school, yes. 

Q: So you -- 

A: And I went to school not -- at 
that time knowing very l
ittle French, but for a -- an 11 year old 
boy, it was astonishing how rapidly -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I acquired the -- to the point  wher
e I speak French fluently today -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- to this day. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. I speak French as good as English.  

Q: Intere sting. 

A: And I™ve never forgotten my Ger man, so 
if a nything good happened during that period, I 
became mul tilingual. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
43 
 
Q: Yes. And how did your Bar 
Mitzvah happen [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, my  Bar Mitzvah, as I told
 you later on in -- much later, I -- I became a caterer, and I can 
tell you one thing, my Bar Mitzvah, from the Bar 
Mitzvahs taking place in the year 2000, or in 
the late 19 -- oh, a -- 19 whatever, th
-that -- it was not 
a theme party. 
Q: No, huh? 

A: No, it was a -- but, the -- the 
-- with emphasis on -- on shall we say, the law, Halacha, th-the 
law, religious law, I -- I did -- 
I did -- I took lessons and I did -- 
did -- did quite well in doing my 
Haftorah, the portion on the Torah. 

Q: And was this -- was this at the school? 

A: In a s -- very short, very, very small synagogue in Nice. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A very small congregation, I th
ink there were about 20 people. 
Q: And why did you decide to -- did you decide
 to do that, or your mother wanted you -- 
A: My mother was very, very -- 
oh, my mother was very -- she was determined to have me  Bar 
Mitzvahed at the age of 13. And right
 here I got letters th
at she wrote to the camp in Gurs to ask 
that my father be given -- ma ybe call it naïv
e or call it whatever, I 
don™t know what you would 
call it, but she wrote a letter to the camp comma
nder begging him to allow hi m to attend what 

she called the Holy Communion, as it is known in 
Christianity. And -- and 
she has these letters 
right here. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And -- and of course they turned it down. So 
-- and she wrot e these letter s up to she still --  
and then she wrote a letter -- I have that corres
pondence, part of which I gave to the Holocaust 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
44 
 
Museum, where she wrot e she will ne ver forgive France for not allowing my father to -- to at tend 
that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- most important of events in the 
life -- in the life cycle of a Jewish boy. 
Q: Was there a -- 
a little party? 
A: Yes.  

Q: For those 20 [indecipherable] 

A: In that  little hotel, in that little dump. In 
that little hotel, in that 
little room, there was some 
herring, and I could recite th
e me nu, it was very basic. 
Q: Right. 

A: But there was a kiddush, the re
-reception. And not to be compar
ed with what you have today. 
Q: Yes, I understand. 

A: But it was a kiddush and my mother did 
her very best to ma ke it me morable. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so it was. And -- 

Q: Did you have friends who ca me ?  Kids? 

A: Yes, yes. A couple of boys and their parents and so forth. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you have good me mo ries of that. 

A: Yes. Wh at I reme mb er most of all however, wa
s the fact that it had been my fervent wish to 
get a bicycle and my father wrote from Gurs to 
my mother that she should get that bicycle, and 
he wrote a letter to me  that -- that I -- now my wi
sh is fulfilled and I could take those trips, and 
indeed I did. I took trips fr
om Canne s to Monte Carlo -- 

Q: On your bicycle? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
45 
 
A: -- on bicycle, yes, yes -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- yes, long trips on my bicycl e. That was -- I lived for that, 
it™s beautiful, wonderful. And -- 
Q: So your father was allowed to write to you some ?  

A: My father was allowed to write until hi s de
portation. The correspondence, it was censored -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- by the French, Vichy government.  

Q: Right. 

A: Tho -- ther -- those le
tters were -- the-they had these thr
ee lines across in yellow, green and 
blue, and th-they were cen-censored letters. But 
they were allowed, and my mother was allowed 
to send packages, food packages. 

Q: To him?  

A: Yes. And she did send packages and some  of hi
s letters indicated th-the 
wonderful bliss, the -- 
the pleasure he had for -- to eat a challah, afte
r not having had a slice of
 bread in a year and a 
half.  

Q: Wo w. 

A: So -- so -- and he shared this
 with his fellow inma tes, and -- 
Q: So she never saw him either? 

A: No. 

Q: But she was able to --  

A: And one day a parcel came back, letters came b
ack, [speaks French here] left without leaving 
a forward address. And that was when he was 
sent to Drancy, a -- a -- another hellhole. An 
unfinished building de -- de -- designed to b
ecome  a camp. It had no facilities, no hygiene, no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
46 
 
toilets, nothing. And no electricity. It was comp
le tely unfinished. And people stayed there two 
and three days and then were shipped in those 
famous cattle wagons to Auschwitz. And the story 
has it that a hundred wome n who we re separated 
from their children jumped out of the windows 
and killed themselves. It™s all part of the legacy. 
Q: Did you -- did you understand, did your mother unde
rstand what mi ght happen, or that was -- 

that came  much later?  To your father. 

A: We  understood the separation, we understood 
the deportation, and the hope, however, never 
left us until much, much later, that awful thi
ngs were going on, but the details of the ma ssive -- 
ma ssive killings, leaked through muc h, much la
ter, through some sources. The Germans were 
very, very good in keeping their activiti
es, their murderous activities a secret. 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- but however, even A-American emba ssy 
officials and -- and -- 
with -- in conjunction 
with Raoul Wallenberg and other people of that
 kind, ga -- became knowledgeable that horrible 
things were occurring. And whereas American plan
es bombe d the rail lines to I.G. Farben, which 
had slave labor, they used the camp inma tes to operate
 thei r factories, it -- it --  it is said and it is 
reme mbered and it is a part of history that they
 did not bomb the rail lines
 leading to Auschwitz, 
because it would delay the war effort. Ca
n I use a handkerchi ef [indecipherable] 
Q: Yes, absolutely use a handkerchief. 

A: Thanks.  

Q: Course. 

A: It --  it -- followed that -- that  --  that  th
e -- the death machine roared day and night, and the 
crematoriums that -- 

Q: But that™s not some thing that you knew at the time -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
47 
 
A: No. 
Q: -- so that you -- you hope
d that he would be okay 
A: No, we did not know it. There was hope that he 
would be seen again or returned, almost up to 
the end of the war. 

Q: Right. 

A: It only became known at the very
 end that he did not survive, 
that he was the victim of the 
persecution. And that is why I ma ke
 it a point, the words to me  ha
ve always had and always will 
have a significant meaning. Words stand for some
thing, they stand for events. They describe 
events and words are very pertin
ent to -- to -- they go far beyond ju
st the spelling of a word. The 
work Holocaust apparently did -- did -- did not co
me to be un-until the -- the -- the mi d -- mi d-
70™s, because this letter that I have from the 
Red Cross ends with, it must be assumed that your 
father was a -- became a victim of the pers
ecution. The word holocaust did not -- was not 
me ntioned in that letter. They 
called it the pers
ecution. So -- 
Q: So a-after your father is sent -- oh, I gue
ss ma ybe we should stop, since we don™t have too 

much time. So I won™t ask another questi
on, we™ll stop the tape
 at this point. 
A: Okay. 

Q: And go to the next tape. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Henry, what -- when did you have to go 
into hiding in Nice
?  This is wa -- 
A: As they -- as they were picking up -- arre
sting the people on the board
walk and searching for 
us, and [indecipherable] 
Q: This is aft -- after the Bar Mitzvah? 

A: Yes.  

Q: So does your mother find a place, is that what happened? 

A: Evidently these were Gentile acquaintance --  acquaintances who -- yes.  

Q: And wha t  was that like for you?  The two 
of you went into hiding, you didn™t have -- y-you 
didn™t have much stuff a nyway. 

A: Oh, it™s a little primitive, but they we
re very -- they were good people, you know. 
Q: And whe r e did you hide, in their attic? 

A: In the attic. 
Q: And were you able to come  down at a
ny point, did you just have to stay there? 
A: Stayed mostly in there. I -- I once ventured
 outside by myself, and in -- in an attempt to 
retrieve some of our more valu
able possessions in that hotel 
where we stayed, but I was only 
partially successful. And we got then a -- we ma na
ged to get a guide who drove us to the foot of 
a mountain, from whenc e  we were ultimately able to walk over farmland in the mi ddle of the 
night, into Switzerland. 

Q: So how long did you stay in hiding in -- in Nice, you think? 

A: It seemed like -- it seemed like a very l
ong time, but I don™t know ex
actly how long it was. 
Q: Were you alone or were there ot her families there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
49 
 
A: There was one more family which then left, 
came and left. It was like a -- a hidi ng pl ace that 
was organized by some  knowledgeable people.  
Q: We re there children there as well -- 

A: In the -- knowledgeable in the resi
stance mo veme nt or some thing like that. 
Q: We re there other children in
 the attic with
 you, or not? 
A: Much older than I. Children, I 
wouldn™t call -- call them children. 
Q: Children. And you were 13 at this point, or over 13? 

A: Yeah, I was over 13. 

Q: So you understand -- 

A: I was 14 when I came  into Switzerland -- 

Q: Into Switzerland. 

A: -- so now I must have been there for several months. 

Q: So you understand much more of what™s going on by this time? 
A: Yes, yes, I came to understand what was going on. 
Q: Does your mother talk to you mo re about it, or if
 -- or is -- are you still sort of left in the dark? 
A: Well, my  mother pa
ssed away in 1970 -- 
Q: No, no, I mean then, in Nice. 

A: We  were preoccupied with how to ma ke our
 way into Switzerland, how to save ourselves. 
And we crossed the border on a rainy night, the --
 as expected the border guards had retreated 
into their huts. 

Q: Because it was raining? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
50 
 
A: That was a bad night. And we ma naged 
to get literally to walk into Ge neva. 
Q: Withoutbeing stopped? 
A: We ll, where we were stopped, taken to a socce
r field, to a dugout, that™s
 where, and me t other 
refugees ther e. And a couple of days later we were taken to a -- a refugee camp. A very primitive 

camp that was our first point of -- of sanctuar
y in -- in Switzerland. What followed was a period 
of time that I spent with the vari ous families. 

Q: So you separated from your mother again? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Cause she stays in the refugee camp? 

A: She was sent to a mo re permanent camp, and that
 camp consisted of a -- a resort hotel, which 
was transforme d into a refug
ee camp because there was no tour
ism in Switzerland during that 
period. 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: So what the Swiss governme nt did, they requ
isitione d all of those resort hotels and turned 
them into reception camps for their 
ma ny refuge es, of varied background. 
Q: Was there a problem with your 
getting in, or not?  They didn™t
 have -- they didn™t ha ve any 
issue with the fact that you were Jewish? 
A: No. 

Q: None. 

A: I did not encounter any anti-Semitism -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in -- 

Q: In Switzerland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

A: -- in Switzerland. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Here is a -- an item in this book. 

Q: And that book is? 

A: Yeah, this -- it -- it has here, it -- page -- 

Q: What™s the name  of t he book? 

A: ﬁSwiss Wartime Work Camps.ﬂ  And here is 
has Henry Gallant, Atlant
a, Georgia, U.S.A.. 
And it gives you a short synopsis of my relations
hip with Switzerland. It said, ﬁMy mother and 
father and I left Germany May 13, 1939, bound for Ha
vana, Cuba on the S.S. Saint Louis. That 
episode became  known as the voyage of the damn
ed. My family and I disembarked in France, 
the other passengers were admitted in Belgium, Holland and England. My father was interned in 

Gurs and in late ™42 transporte
d from Drancy to Auschwitz. He 
was never heard from again. My 
mother and I lived in Nice until
 September of 1942. French collabo
rators arrested thousands of 
Jews and we found a hiding place in an attic a
nd stayed there a few months until my mo ther 
arranged for false identification 
papers and a guide to take us to the Swiss border. We  walked 
over pastures at night and ente
red at Switzerland illegally. We 
were not sent back. We were 
taken to a football field near 
Geneva, having crossed the border 
at Annema sse. And after several 
days were sent to a Aufangslager reception camp
 at Ayresfield, Berner Oberland. The camp was 
primitive, or rustic, as you would expect in 
ba sic traini ng. The food ad
equate and the Swiss 
soldiers friendly and sympathetic with our plight
.ﬂ And then it goes on to 
tell the rest  of the 
story. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So you tell me 
the story, instead 
of reading it. 
A: Oh.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
52 
 
Q: So -- whoops. I thought I threw out some thing -- 
A: Well, I lived in several families. I lived fi rst -- 

Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. 

A: Hm?  

Q: Why did your mother dec-decide that she 
was going to go to Switzerland?  Had she been 
talking to people in the resist
ance?  Do you have any idea why? 
A: Why -- 

Q: Because o-obviously a lot of people didn™t -- 

A: -- well when you -- when you see 
people disappear overnight -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And whe n you see the French gendarmes ar
resting people, then 
you know you better get -- 
Q: You better get out of there. 

A: -- do something. And Switzerla
nd borders -- borders France. A
nd the only other place would 
have been Spain, and that would have been a very long -- 

Q: That would have been a much longer journey. 

A: And mor e  difficult to cross the Pyrenees
, the mountains. The Alps. Switzerland was the 
logical place and besides, we had that 
fa mily that had supported us partially. 

Q: They lived in Switzerland.  

A: The -- the -- these friends by th
e name of Benedict, the f-family
 that I mentioned supported us 
-- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- throughout our stay ther
e for, you know, several mont hs. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
53 
 
Q: Wa s the guide some body who wa s from the resist
ance?  Is that what -- do you reme mber who 
this person -- 
A: No, had no contact with him.
 He didn™t speak, kept quiet. 
Q: And he just took you to the pl ace. 

A: He just went through his -- his job 
in a very myth -- mechanical way. 
Q: And you were in a -- in a car, up to a certain point? 

A: Up to the -- where we got out. And he just 
sa id, walk over this field and you will come  -- go 
straight and you will see ahead of
 you a mountain. Try to ma ke yourself -- try to ma ke it possi ble 
to cross that -- that mountain. And -- 

Q: That mus t  have been very nerve-wracking. 

A: Yeah, to say the least. 

Q: So what was the ca -- 

A: And very dangerous. 
Q: Cause you could have been caught at
 any time  or shot or whatever. 
A: Correct. And you would not 
know what would happen to you if you were caught. You would 
not know the response. It wa
s an act of desperation. 
Q: And you felt it and your mother felt it. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you were alone when you walked across
 there, you weren't with anybody else. So you 
didn™t -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- you -- so that all of this
 was unfamiliar territory to you. 
A: Yeah, totally unfamiliar, exactly, totally unfamiliar. I had no idea what  the out -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
54 
 
Q: So you just followed his finger? 
A: Yes. 

Q: He said go in that directi
on and that™s where you went to. 
A: Pretty much. I couldn™t --
 I wouldn™t put it any other way. 
Q: But Geneva™s pretty fa r. You walked to Geneva? 

A: No, Geneva from Annemasse is
 not all that  terribly far. 
Q: No?  Uh-huh. 

A: It -- it -- it™s maybe -- I -- 
I would say probably a two hour walk 
into the outskirts of Geneva.  
Q: And wha t  -- what was the -- the weather 
at  this time? It was raining that ni ght. 
A: When we  first began that -- that long, long 
excursion, if you will ca
ll it that, it was raining 
cats and dogs. It was raining severely. How the 
weather turned later on is not in my me mory. 
Q: We re you wet?  You must have been 
-- you must have been soaking wet.  
A: I would assume  -- I was assume  -- I would assume  that I was wet.  
Q: And do you reme mbe r  the kind of shoes you were wearing? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: Did you have a rucksack 
with you?  Did you have -- 
A: Yes, I had a backpack. 

Q: You had a backpack. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And your mother the same , do 
you think?  Or do you think -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
55 
 
A: Don™t really reme mbe r  what she had, I thi
nk she had some  kind of a bag that she held, you 
know. 
Q: But you couldn™t have carried very much -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- because you knew you had to go -- 

A: Practically nothing. 

Q: Right. 

A: Practically absolutely, I would say less than no
thing but the very bare essentials, ma ybe some  
toilet ar ticles like -- 

Q: So did you lead your mother, 
did your mother lead you?  Do you 
have any recollection, or did 
you just hold onto each other -- did you hold hands? 

A: No, just -- just walk. 

Q: Just walked. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just walked.  
Q: And whe n the Swiss police got you in Geneva and took you some place, were you f -- was that 

a frightening situation, or th
ey were not mean to you? 
A: No, because there were other peop
le there in that dugout at the -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- that soccer field. And it was a relief, actually,to be what we -- it became  apparent that we 

were on -- on solid ground and we were safe, 
and we were not threatened by what we had 
witnessed in the south of France. 

Q: But you had false papers, is that correct? 

A: For -- yeah, yeah, identif -- identification papers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
56 
 
Q: And is that when you became He nry Gallant? 
A: Oh no. No, no, no, no. 

Q: No?  No, that beca -- 

A: No, that is a totally different -- 

Q: So who were you?  So who were you then? 

A: -- they -- you have to -- you had -- fo
r that you have to buy my second book. 
Q: I see. But you haven™t finished 
the first one yet, Henry, so -- 
A: That -- no, that™s correct, that™s correct. 

Q: So, who -- 

A: You™ve got a good memory. 

Q: So who -- yeah right -- so who was -- who was 
on your passport, if it was a fake paper?  What 
was the name?  It was st
ill Heinz Goldstein? 
A: I would imagine. Or it was a totally different name . 
Q: It would have to be
 a different name  --  
A: I -- I had -- 
Q: -- you couldn™t be Jewish. 

A: -- no, I have -- I have -- no, no, absolutely not. I 
have that in me mory that it was a totally 
different name. I don™t reme mber the name. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But it -- it was definitely in -- in no way rela
ted to my real name or my -- my future adopted 
name , no, no.  

Q: Right. 

A: No, no, no, these were papers
 that were suggesting a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
57 
 
Q: A different identity. 
A: As a ma tter of fact, we were stopped by a gend
arme, that™s just a si de 
incident. We  were, the -
- the car was stopped by a gendarme who looked at 
those papers. My mother spoke some  French, 
in fact, she spoke good French. And -- and the 
gendarme, this I reme mber distinctly, the 
gendarme saying in a certain voice, Sa  sont vous
 papier? These are your 
papers, and my mother 
said, oh, oui, bien sur. And o -- and -- and he -- 
and he said, [speaks French here] he said -- and 
he ma de no -- he -- he -- in my view, in my reco
llection, he left no doubt at all that -- that he was 

aware these papers were -- were faked. And -- but 
he also seemed to indicate that he knew the 
times we we re living in, and he -- we were just
 fortunate in running in 
-- ther -- ther e were 
people like that throughout the histor
y of World War II. People who -- 
Q: Who just turned and looked away. 

A: -- yes, there were people like
 that. There were people like that
 in Germany as well, who to -- 
who risked their lives. And there were people like 
that in Poland, who risked
 their lives for the -- 
to -- who hid children and did all so
rts of things that could have 
cost them dearly had -- had -- 
you know, had it become  known. 

Q: So what does this -- what does this genda
rme say to your mother?  This -- these are your 
papers? 

A: [speaks French] -- if you believe  these to be your papers -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- then you ma y proceed. 

Q: I see, so it was clear 
that he was [indecipherable] 
A: Clear, absolutely. Left no 
doubt in my mi nd whatsoever. 
Q: Right, right. And that happened before you came  --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
58 
 
A: And I hear that as if it -- as
 if you were talking to me  now. 
Q: Mm. And that was before Geneva? 
A: Yes, of course. 

Q: This is wa y before. 

A: Absolutely.  

Q: Yes. 

A: That was mi dway. We
 were just stopped. 
Q: Right. 

A: There were roadbl ocks at th -- that was one of those roadblocks. As it was leading to the 

border. 

Q: The border of Switzerland? 

A: Correct. 

Q: I see. So this is a French gendarme --  
A: An -- absolutely, and -- 
Q: -- or border --  

A: -- certainl y a French gendarme. 

Q: Right. 

A: La gaul si ville -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who was known to be -- th-they were known to
 be like the SS, they were horrible people, 
by and large. 

Q: So that must have been awful as you -- as
 you start to go because you have no idea what™s 
going to happen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
59 
 
A: I wa -- yes, I -- that is what
 I would -- would -- would call it.  
Q: So when you were -- when you were -- 

A: That was one of those mo ments, one of those 
terrible mo me nts of -- of stress and anxiety and 
so forth. 

Q: Right. And then you got over it,
 and then you just kept going. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mber that the weather changed? Th
at the -- that it didn™
t stay [indecipherable] 
A: The last thing on -- on my mi nd during that 
period was the weather. I ma  -- I don™t know what 
transpired exactly in my  thoughts, bu
t the weather was not part of it.  
Q: Did you hate this? 

A: Did I hate? 

Q: We re you angry that you had to go through this
, or was this just a normal ti me  some how?  

A: I think my entire life I ju
st take things as they come . 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: There are always mo me nts that you -- that one 
dislikes and that one does not find terribly 
amusing or exciting or enjoyable. 

Q: Mm. 

A: But I guess that™s part of being here. 

Q: Right.  

A: Better being here 
than not being here. 
Q: Than not being here. Did you complain to yo
ur mother as your -- as this -- because your 
change starts when you™re seven, eight years ol
d. I mean, your -- you™re not a grown person. So 
do you complain to your mother, or do you fee -- do you feel as a kid that things are so bad, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
60 
 
they™re happening for everybody, they™re so bad 
that I shouldn™t complain?  Do you have any 
recollection of what that 
was like for you as a kid? 
Q: That™s a very good question. I -- I don™t think th
at -- that -- complain
ing really was not par-
part of my -- my psychological ma ke-up. I -- I do not complain. 
Q: Did you ever cry, when you were alone? 

A: I cried -- I cried terribly when I was separa
tedfrom my motherin 
-- upon disembarking in -- 
in France -- 

Q: In France, when you went to the [i ndecipherable] 

A: Yeah, that  was -- that was a horribl e -- that  
was one of the most horrible time, cause I had 

never been previously separated, so -- 

Q: Right, right, so that™s when you cried. 

A: That separation was, you know, in the -- no
t knowing which and what was going to happen 
and so forth. That went on -- 
Q: Did anyone talk to you? 
A: N-No, because I di d my crying in
 the solitude of
 my own person. 
Q: Right. 

A: I -- to be -- to be precise, I 
would not -- it -- it wasn™t in my na
ture to cry in public. I did not -- 
I had enough sense of awareness 
that I went to the bathroom and cried. But I was very unhappy. 
Q: Yeah, I imagine. 

A: Yeah, I was very unhappy. I was very unhappy, it 
was the epitome  of loneliness at that very 
mome nt in time  and place. 

Q: And do you think your pare
nts knew that about you? 
A: Well, my  father wasn
™t -- was not bothered.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
61 
 
Q: He™s not there, ri
ght, but your mo ther -- 
A: He was already -- 
Q: -- he had been arrested. 

A: Yeah, yeah. No, I don™
t think so. I don™t -- 

Q: Except she very quickly tried 
to get you out of that school. 
A: Yeah, a few -- it -- I think -- no
t a -- weeks, or a couple of mont
hs transpired, more than that. 
Q: Oh, so maybe she knew, but
 you didn™t know that she knew. 
A: I think the French, if I™m not 
mi staken, if I reme mber correctly, 
the Fr ench inst it --  set into 
motion a law that women with children could-- could have their children with them. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: And I think it was in context with that ordinan
ce, or with that new la
w that -- that we were 
reunited. That™s -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- pretty much as I reme mber it. 
Q: Okay, right. So how long were you in th
e soccer field in Sw
itzerland, do you reme mber?  
Days, weeks, hours? 

A: Three, four days.  

Q: And they gave you sufficient food? 

A: Yes. Th -- it was like camp style -- 

Q: So you were okay. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: It wasn™t na -- it wasn™t -- 

A: No, no, no, do not reme mber having been hungry 
or anything like that, 
no, they took care -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
62 
 
Q: You never reme mber being hungry? 
A: N-No, no, they took care of us. And -- 

Q: And that was -- that™s been true throughout
 this whole circumstan
ce, that you were not 
hungry. 

A: And I was not very dema nding either, you kn
ow -- you know, I think c
ontinental breakfast 
was invented in Europe, you know. That consists 
of a slice of bread, mar malade and a piece of 
margarine or butter and a glass of
 milk. This is breakfast, you know? 
Q: And that was enough. 

A: Or in -- in Switzerland it was also comm
onplace, I spent a -- a certain amount of time on a 
far m because the Swiss me n were -- they had to se
rve in the army, so they took -- by that time I 
was already -- I was no more a child in that 
sense and I worked on a farm. And breakfast 
consisted of the typical Swiss Rösti, you know, lik
e potatoes that -- not po
tato pancakes, but like 
hash brown potatoes. They would grind them and 
then fry them and this -- this, and bread -- 
Q: We re they good? 

A: Oh yeah, excellent. This and bread and milk 
and so forth, o -- coffee au lait, you know, touch 

of coffee with a lot of mi lk was breakfast. 

Q: So, you -- are you -- you™re very adaptable 
as a kid. You -- you keep [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, I was -- I found myself to be adaptable to
 a -- to a lot of different circumstances. And 
my -- the time I spent in Switzerland, these fam
ilies, I think I mentione
d it, they were of a 
different background. I spent a year with a secula
r Jewish family, one that was not religious. I 
mean, it was nothing extraordinary to have a pork ro
ast for dinner. And -- and then I spent a little 

over a year with a secondary Gentile fa mily, se
condary teacher. And lo
 and behold, I ended up 
with an Orthodox fa mily, a very religious Jewish family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
63 
 
Q: That was the last one. 
A: That was the last family, right
, that™s when I attended the -- 

Q: So what are the circumstances of your staying 
with a family?  Are you sort of like a foster kid, 

they get money from someplace? 

A: Exactly, exactly, exactly. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We -- the Swiss -- the Swiss organi za --  they 
we re organized and -- and th-they -- they had a -
- a branch of c-call it th
e Red Cross or some thing, admi nister the 
-- th-the -- the --
 the -- the -- the 
so-called youngsters, teenagers and so forth, they were kind of separated fr om the adults.  

Q: Were ther e other children in the family, I mean, in these families? 

A: In one family there were two boys wi -- they 
we re a little older than 
I, and in the Gentile 
fa mily there were two -- two girls.
 One is -- I think is 20 or 21. 
Q: Sounds nice. 
A: Very interesting, yes.  
Q: Why was  it interestin
g?  Why do you say that? 
A: Well, it was -- it was interesting that we -- di
ffi cult to go into -- in -- 
into details, but it -- it 
was a novelty of sorts.  

Q: For you to be around girls? 

A: The environment for me, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: Mm-hm. I mean, I was in, call it puberty, or
 whatever, you know. And they were also very 
curious, these -- th-th -- that family wa
s very curi -- there were questions. 
Q: So they wanted to know about your experiences? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
64 
 
A: They knew about the Jewish lifestyle. Probabl
y their knowledge -- their Biblical orientation. 
And whatever it follows the -- the 
-- the varied traditions of -- I™m 
trying to be as diplomatic as I 
possibly can. But they were -- 

Q: Do you want to be less diplomatic? 

A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: I said, do you want to be less diplomatic? 

A: I-If your curiosity comp
els you to -- to do -- do -- 
Q: I™ll ask, yes, what was it like? 

A: Yeah, well, they had never seen a circumcised boy. 

Q: Right. 

A: And it was quite a new experime nt, you 
know, a new experience, rather, you know. 
Q: Right. 

A: And th-they -- they -- they 
wanted to -- to see what this 
thing looks like you know? And of 
course I wasn™t -- I wasn™t about to di srobe, if you will -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- under these -- in -- in this 
particular circumstance. But, I 
said, if you accidentally -- I said, 
I™m going to take a bath or a shower and if you ha
ppen to walk in, that won™t bother me one bit. 
Some thing along that line. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- 

Q: Wa s that uncomf -- 

A: -- a -- but there was nothing new, really, they
 -- t hey -- t hat was 
nothing -- nothing new. I 
reme mber seeing a -- a film where -- with -- where Jews were in jeopardy and the only way that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
65 
 
these guards could ascertain the -- the religious, 
you know, that they had caught up the Jews or 
not would be exactly through this ritual which -- 
which by the -- in -- in -- in -- among Jews is 
commonplace. 
Q: Right.  

A: So. 

Q: We re you seeing your mother at this -- 

A: Yes, they had a -- they had a rule that th
e Swiss government -- I call 
it the governme nt but it 
was a branch of the governme nt in charge of imi -- affairs of immi gration. And they had a rule 

that children, or teenagers or whatever, family
 me mbers ma y be reunited for a period of three 
days every six weeks. So while I was with this 
family, I actually saw my mother every six weeks 
for three days. 

Q: And that -- that was true for each of th
e three fa milies that you were with, you said? 
A: Correct. And they even paid 
the expense of the guesthouse wher
e you were staying and the -- 
and the meals and so forth. Th
at -- that they did, and -- 
Q: Wa s this difficult for you to see your moth
er and then have to go away for awhile? 
A: We ll, it wasn™t exactly easy, but you know, th 
-- I can reme mber it. It was wonderful. We  
were close. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, and due to the conditions that existed 
at that time . And -- and 
then la -- three days 
go by, and you know -- 

Q: And then she™s gone. 

A: Yeah, but you look forward to the next six weeks, I mean -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
66 
 
A: I mean to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: She -- 

Q: And she was in a refugee camp. And what did that mean? 

A: Well, they called it a camp. Th
ey can™t call it a resort hotel, you know?  So a camp can me an -
- can mean two things. A ca mp need not 
be -- need not be a concentration camp. 

Q: Right. 

A: After all. But a camp is not a home either, you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: So the word camp could -- could imply anything, you know?  Children in the summe r go to 

camp. 

Q: Right.  

A: And -- 
Q: Was she living in 
bad conditions, or not? 
A: No. 
Q: No, she wasn™t. 

A: No, no, not at all. Not at all. 

Q: So do you correspond with her? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So in between the visits -- 

A: Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. 

Q: So it mus t  have been important. 

A: Quite frequently as a ma tter of fac t , yeah. Both ways. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
67 
 
Q: Did you end up saving those letters? 
A: There are some  of those letters, a couple of
 letters are floating around among ma  -- among hi -
- literally hundreds of pictures, which I have ne
ver bothered, throughout the y
ears to -- to catalog 
in a picture album. 

Q: Right. 

A: They are in boxes [indecipherable] and they re
ally come from every -- from every stage, I 
always -- I would say every era. I 
have pictures from our life in 
Berlin before the war. I have 
pictur es of our time spent in Nice, on the French
 Riviera. I have pictur
es that were take n in 
Switzerland. And beside having stay
ed with these fa milies, I spent 
the little -- a little more than 
one year in a boarding school, which was known by 
the name  of Ecole d™Huma nité. Ecole means 
school and Huma nité means humanity. 

Q: Right. 

A: The school of huma nity. And the professor 
and his wife, who ran that school were two 
German Gentiles who left Ger many at 
the onset of Hitler taki ng the governme nt. 
Q: I think we  have to stop there. So why don™
t we start there, when
 you talk about the -- 
A: That™s a good point. 

Q: -- boarding school. 

A: Excellent point to start.

Q: Okay. We ended and you started talking 
about the boarding school, Ecole d-Huma nité. 
A: Yeah, Ecole d™Huma nité. 
Q: Tell me  about that. This was in Switzerland, right? 

A: Yeah, yeah. In Switzerland, not far from Zu
rich. And it was operated by a fellow whose name  
was Paul -- Paolos -- Paolo -- Pa
ul Geheeb. He had a very fa m
ous school in -- in Germany, 
which was, I would say, 50 years ahead of its time
. He -- it was very classic. He -- he was a 
friend of Mahatma Gandhi. He knew intimately Ra
bbi Don Attagori, the fa
mous author. And if 
you went up to the dormitories along the stair wh
at -- what do you call it, the stairs, you had 
pictures from Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Maxim Go
rky. And it was all about the classics. And on 
Saturday they -- they would have what they 
called andoch, a certain ev
ening of spiritual -- 
spiritual -- spirituality or some thing. And they
 would play Beethoven™s 
Fifth, or Eine kleine 
Nachtmusik, Mozart, Beethoven, Hayden, Bach, Brah
ms  and Handel and so forth and so on. And 
my entire th -- wa -- culture was wr
itten with a capital C.
 And I went to this school along with a 
lot of other children who were re
fugees in Switzerland during that time, and among t he student 
body were two brothers and that™s 
a very interesting it
em. There were two brothers, the nephews 
of the chief of staff of the German -- Germ
an ar my, whose name  wa
s Wa lter von Brauchitsch. 
And their name  was Hans and Matteas von Brauch
itsch. And we were very close, we were 
friends. And in the issue of 
ﬁLifeﬂ ma gazine of May 1946 there™s a caption where German 
general™s nephews went to school with Jewish --
 the Jewish immigrants. 
And there™s one picture 
of me  and -- and the Brauchitsch brothers. And 
we have kept in touc
h all throughout my stay 
here in the United States. And I we
nt to that school for about a little more than a year. And in 
1947 I came to America. Immi grated legally. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
69 
 
Q: So was that school -- was it -- 
it good for you to be in that school? 
A: Well, I think it was very good, it -- in retrospect it was very good because the emphasis on 
culture is basically where even t
oday I -- I developed the -- the tast
e or a liking for classic music, 
for example. And had I not gone to that school, we
ll I™m not saying that -- that the Stones or the 
Beatles or whatever are not wonderful
 to listen to, or that it™s not 
part of -- e-each age has its sed 
-- has its own music, so to speak, but classic musi
c is forever and I came to
 appreciate it and then 
even today have an appreciation for classic music. 

Q: Did you -- 

A: And it was developed in that -- 

Q: In that school. 

A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: Did you work at that school also? 

A: Well, I -- my skill that  I acqui red in hotel school
, I did pr etty much run the kitchen there, yes. 
Q: When did you go to hotel school?  
I don™t think we spoke about that. 
A: To hotel school, when I stayed with my last
 family, that Orthodox -- 
I think I me ntioned the 
Orthodox Jewish fa mily. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Well, I spent the -- I went to 
school in the daytime, to hotel 
school and in the evening I would 
come  home , to what was then home, a foster home,
 if you will, to -- to th
ose people that I stayed 
with. But that was the period 
that I went to hotel school. 
Q: And is -- 

A: And that was in Lucerne. 

Q: And is that before the end of the war? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
70 
 
A: That was before the end of the war. 
Q: So what was it like to have the wa r end? 

A: Excuse me , I have to change that. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was at the end of the war, because the 
school occupied one half of the building and the 
other half was a hotel. And our guests at the time -- it
 was just at the end of the war, our guests at 
the time  wer e  G.I.s who were on a seven day rest
 trip to Switzerland, what
 they called, R and R, 
rest and relaxation. They came th
ere to spend seven days in Lucerne and that was my first 
experience with real Americans and th-their lifes
tyle. And when I say lifestyle I™m referring to 
the meals that they ate. And they at
e the apple pie and left the crust. 

Q: They left the crust? 

A: For the most part, yeah. At the end of the me
al there were -- you could see -- that was, to us 
was completely strange because it is a European 
custom to finish what you have on your plate, 
unlike the way we live. If we™re not crazy about 
so mething we certainly don™t eat it, we just 
leave it.  

Q: So what did you think of these guys leaving the crust? 

A: Oh, they were terrific -- oh, the gu -- they were 
terrific. The -- in -- in 
those days, I -- they will 
never come  again, 1945, everything that was American was -- 

Q: Wa s good. 

A: -- was great. From a Parker 51, which were the f
ountain pens, to -- to Chesterfield or Came l -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- cigarettes. The -- the very plain, G.I. i
ssued raincoats -- anything that was American was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
71 
 
fabulous. And the guys, the soldiers 
were -- really, they were kids. 
They were in their -- 20 - 21 - 
22. And -- 
Q: But your se -- you™re about 17 when the war ends, right? 

A: Right. And they were about 21. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- and they were -- I me t them in night 
clubs, they -- doing the ji
tterbug and all that was 
American, you know. It was very exciting. 

Q: And is it because you me t them that you wanted
 to come  to the United States, or  did you want 
to come  anyway? 

A: Oh no, no, no, no. We had -- we had wanted to come
 to America in the -- in the late 30™s. Our 
trip to -- that -- the voyage, 
the so-called voyage of the damne d was a prelude to entering the 
United States. Our trip to Cuba was -- was part
 of waiting out the -- the quota number to come  

up. So that was -- we had intended to go to Ameri
ca all along. Cuba was not 
our -- was not to be 
our final destination. Our quest was to en
ter the United States, come to America. 
Q: So what was the end of the war like in Switz
erland?  Wa s it very happy, or -- I me an it -- was 
it -- did you mark it, or did 
it just sort of pass you by? 
A: No, it was a transition, it was 
a transition. It wa s also the time 
that we were to find out that 
our father would never return, you know?  And it 
was the beginning of -- of a new -- of kind of a 
new life. You -- 

Q: How did you find out about your
 father?  Do you reme mbe r? 
A: I got that -- that letter from
 the Red Cross, that who -- they 
researched this and their findings 
indicated that he was deported to Auschwitz. 

Q: And did you and your mother ask for that information?  Was that how -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
72 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: You did. 

A: Yes, yes. Mm-hm. And that was the response. 

Q: So, there™s a great sadness at the same  ti me
 that you™re happy the war is over, it™s -- 
A: Yeah, the -- absolutely. Surprisingly, the wa
y I s -- reme mber it today, tha -- when you have a 
loved one whom you haven™t seen for six or so y
ears, the -- the shock is some what dimi nished. 
As they say, the time  he als all wounds. 

Q: The what? The -- 

A: Time  hea l s -- 

Q: Heals all wounds? 

A: -- all wounds. 

Q: Did it? 

A: That™s what they say. 
Q: I know, but I™m asking you whether -- 
A: You -- it -- I -- I™d -- I would a -- I would sa
y that that is ma  -- very mu ch so, yes.  

Q: Okay. 

A: I would [indecipherable] to 
that. Maybe not all wounds, you ne
ver forget. But of course you 
don™t forget. But the intensity of losing a loved one 
is stronger in th
e early stage of absence than 
after a number of years. 

Q: And you think that wa s true for your mother, or you think it was different? 

A: It™s hard to say. I don™t know how my mo
ther felt. I wouldn™t know how, but you don™t know 
what -- in -- in -- intima tely you don™t know 
what another person is really feeling. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
73 
 
A: So I can™t say. 
Q: Right. 

A: You mi ss a person that is clos
e to you, perhaps forever. I™m me re
ly referring to the intensity. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The shock, the drama. 

Q: Right, right, it™s different. 

A: You know?  You know. 

Q: So, when the -- the wa r is over, do yougo -- you -- you leave the foster home and you go to 

your mother? 

A: When the war was over I had -- I lived with my mother for a period of time until we actually 

came over on the S.S. America, one of the ships. 

Q: Was it diffi cult to get -- to get a vi sa to come to the United States or  not? 

A: We ll, it took a number of years. As you know, 
we were refused admission in 1939, and at the 
end of the war it was very easy, the sympathy for -- for the victims of the -- now known as 

Holocaust wa s -- was very much -- was very acute. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So it was not diffi cult to enter the United Stat es
 at the end of the war 
for victims of the -- of 
the period.  

Q: But you then had to ma ke another change. Did you know English? 

A: Yes, I had learned English a
nd I was rather good at it, too. 
Q: Oh, you were? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: You -- and your mother spoke English fluently? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
74 
 
A: She did also, mm-hm -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- mm-hm. 

Q: But -- all right, so the-ther
e™s not a linguist
ics problem -- 
A: So I came to America, and -- 

Q: And wha t  happened? 

A: -- and I had relatives who had preceded -- I 
had more than one relative who had preceded us 
in -- in thei r quest to live in America. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they -- I -- we spent a coup
le of days in New York, then 
I went to Philadelphia, where I 
had an uncle, an aunt and two cousins. And 
I worked in a Swiss pastry shop as a -- 
Q: In Philadelphia? 

A: -- in Philadelphia for a few days and then they 
also had a pastry shop in Atlantic City, so they 
transferred me to Atlantic City, and that was my
 first experience, so to speak, after arriving in 
New York and in New York I spent a few days. My aunt took me  to see a musical, my first 

musical, which I still reme mber distinctly wa
s Oklahoma with Gordon MacRae. And -- and then 
I went to Atlantic City, and Atlant
ic City wasn™t a very exciting pla
ce in -- at that time. It went 
through several transitions. At the time I got to
 Atlantic City was in 1940 -- in 1947, and you had 
the boardwalk -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- and the old part of the -- of
 Atlantic City. It was a highli
ght, it was the time when Saratoga, 
the horses, they -- the Greenbr
ier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs. I mean, America was 
some thing different, totally different and much 
di fferent than it is today. Atlantic City in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
75 
 
particular went through different
 stages. You know, from that er
a -- from that time it -- it got 
completely run down until gambling came to Atlantic City. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And then you had a different -- you had a different pl ace again, you know, the old pe ople got 

chased out of their homes and they built fabulous hot
els like in Las Vegas. So after Atlantic City 
I visited my cousin in Beaumont, Texas and I 
stayed there for a coupl
e of months. And then 
returned to New York and worked in 
-- as a cook in a couple of hotels. 
Q: And did you come  ba ck to New York because you 
didn™t wa nt to stay in these ot her places? I 
mean, why did you do that? 

A: We ll, Beaumont, Texas was not really my -- my
 first choice. It was 
a wonderful place, it has 
m -- great -- at that time a grea
t little town, today it™s a great 
big town. But it wasn™t where I 
wanted to be and also in my -- 
in -- in my -- in the pursuit of 
my career, I -- I was a chef at the 
time and worked at the ol d Astor Hotel, which 
meanwhile has been torn down. I worked in the 
Hotel New Yorker and at a later stage I worked
 at the Wa ldorf Astoria for about 10 years. 
Q: Mm. As a chef? 

A: No. I didn™t know wa -- there™s a chef. I worked 
in the -- in the nightcl
ub, in the Empire room. 
Q: Hm. What did you do? 

A: And that was the -- it was th
e showroom -- I beg your pardon? 
Q: What did you do? 

A: I was a captain. That is the cl
osest to the ma itre™d. I had a sect
ion of the -- of 
the room that 
was under my direction, the service, per se. And 
I enjoyed that very much. The showroom -- we 
had one act following another. We  had Tony Be
nnett, Peggy Lee, Dinah Shore, the Pointer 
Sisters, Diana Ross and the Supreme s . MauriceChevalier and Gilbert B
écaud, a French singer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
76 
 
And Charles Aznavour, another French singer. And 
we had -- and the guests that attended these 
performa nces, we had Liza Minelli and so fort
h. And I enjoyed that very much, it was very 
entertaini ng. 

Q: Did you mi nd not being a chef, or you were [indecipherable] 

A: No, whe n I went to hotel school I took two cour
ses, actually. I became  
a -- a -- I -- I took a -- 
in -- in -- I took a course in the 
culinary art, but I also
 took a course in a 
-- a service course. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And in -- in my career, I -- I was a maitre™d 
for a number of years and not just in the Empire 
room, but I also worked -- the Empire room clos
ed -- actually the Empire room was a seasonal 
affair. It closed in July and reopened in late Se
ptember, which to me  was -- was very beneficial. 
It was not only benef -- it was very convenient,
 because I used those two or three summer 
months to -- to work in the Catskill mountains
. And I got a great deal
 of experience in the 
Catskill mo untains. I worked in some  of the great 
hotels, of which mos t  of them are closed. It™s 
all part of an era that is hist
ory long forgotten, but at that time
 the epitome of elegant living. A -- 
I would say a culture that just 
simply, like so many other things, 
a culture that disappeared. Of 
the approximate two mi llion Jews living in New 
York, you could safely say that 99 percent of 
them spent their summers in -- in the Catskill mo
untains, if not for the whole summe r , then for a 
weekend, or -- or for a week or two.  

Q: So what hotel did you work at? 

A: I worked at Grossingers. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Which is an -- an icon. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
77 
 
A: I worked at The 
Concord, another icon. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I was the maitre™d in The Pines in Sout
h Fallsburg. I was the maitre™d in a place called 
Gibbers, and The Evans in Loch Sheldrake. And I also was the ma itre™d for two seasons -- you 

must reme mber that this was seasonal, so when you say, well, you™ve worked in so ma ny 

different places, the answer to that is simple, 
it -- these were seasonal hotels that opened up for 
Passover in -- generally in April,
 around April, closed again afte
r Passover and reopened in June, 
around Memorial day and stayed open until the hi
gh holidays, the Jewish 
holidays, like Sukkahs 
and Simc has Torah and so forth and so on. And I 
worked there on th -- for the entire summer, 
until the Empire room opened up in late Sept ember 
and that™s when I went back to the Empire 
room. So I s pent 10 years in the Empire room, 
with the exception of the summers, which I spent 
in the Catskills. And these hotels in the Catskills
 had -- each had their 
own -- its own identity. 
The Grossinger and the Concords were family hot
els. A place I worked at was called Shavunge 
Lodge. That was a place for singles. The Wa ldameer
 was a place for singles, but ol der singles. 
So each of these hotels had their own client ele. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And it was a pleasant -- pleasant time . And -- 
but all in the past, because 90 percent of all 
these hotels do no longer exist.  

Q: So how long were you in this business? 

A: In this business I was until the major change
 occurred in 1975 when we moved to Atlanta, 
Georgia. And th -- what happened 
is that the acts that I had me
ntioned in the Empire room, Tony 
Bennett, Johnny Mathis, Dinah Shore and the Pointe
r Sist ers, they all -- and Liza Minelli and all 

of these people had a salary of approximatel
y six to 7,000 dollars. Steve La wrence and Eydie 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
78 
 
Gor mé was another, and Ed Sullivan. These were
 the days th-that -- Jack Benny and George 
Burns -- not only is that time  gone, like -- like gone with the wind, but it has disappeared and so -
- and -- an-and it ex -- it precisely
 happened at a time  when the sa
laries of these e- entertainers 
went sky high. And the Empire -- and then it b
ecame  a ma tter of -- stri
ctly of economi cs. The 
Empire room had 500 seats and the cover charge
, meaning the -- meaning the cost of simply 
getting a table to sit down, it did 
not even cover a drink or anyt
hing to eat, that way the cover 
charge was a so-called entry ticket, if you will. A
nd the cover charge went from five dollars to 15 
dollars per person. And then it went to 25 dollars. At the same  time the salaries from 7,000 

dollars went to 35,000 dollars. So high that at one poi
nt it got to -- it became  
a reality that Barbra 
Streisand got one million dollars to appear in th
e room for one week. And it was logi cal that  the 
hotel could not sustain, even t
hough the -- the nightclub was not de
signed to ma ke mo ney, it was 
mainly designed to attract conventions and people to
 fill the rooms. That wa
s the idea, to fill the 
rooms. But those salaries were unsupportable, so
 the only place that you c
ould have that kind of 
entertainment would end up to be La s Vegas, 
where the profit and the money came  from the 
gambling tables. And in 1975, the Empire room cl
osed. It -- it -- and it became just a banquet 
facility, and the nightc
lub as such, as it was known, no longer 
existed. And -- and the only place 
that you could have the kind of entertainment would 
be in a facility where three or four thousand 
people would cor -- would congregate, would sit.
 And that was Las Vegas and a place in New 
Jersey and vary -- some  venues. 

Q: So what -- what did you do in Atlanta? 

A: In Atlanta I worked through my c onnections at 
that time in the hotel in
dustry. I came close to 
the management of the Fairmont Hotel company, 
which was based at the time in San Francisco, 
in Denver and in New Orleans. And they had a t-- a hotel in -- in Atlanta. But that was in 1975, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
79 
 
and Atlanta had not as yet become  what you would 
like to call an intern
ational city. And they 
were not used to -- and the -- they were not used to
 those prices. And so when I said that I -- first 
hand experience, I -- I came  to ma na ge the Ve
netian Room, which was the nightclub in the 
Fairmont Hotel. And Tony Bennett appeared th
ere and -- and well, and a number of other 
entertainers. And when the phone rang for some one to ma ke reservations, they would say, well 
how much does it cost to get 
in?  So I would say, well the cove
r charge is 15 dollars. And the 
response on the other end would be, and what 
do you get for that?  And without trying to -- 
without -- trying to avoid to sound sarcastic, I w
ould say well, you get a table, and you get to sit 
down. But how else -- what else would you sa
y?  Th-That was the logical answer. And 
consequently the entertainment of that -- that ca
liber of entertainment again went the way they 
did it in New York. And so Richar
d Swig, who was owner of the hot
el decided that Atlanta -- the 
only thing that would work in At
lanta would be western entertai
nment. And so they brought in 
Loretta Lynn and a couple of ot
her -- and Alison Krauss, some 
people with a [indecipherable] 
with a reputation in the area of 
western music. And so you had a lot of -- I don™t want to use the 
term -- I -- I think that to sa
y rednecks, you know, would probably 
not take -- take too well, so 
let™s say country folk, or whatever you will. But th
ey -- the western music in -- in that  -- that  kind 

of caliber of western mu sic didn™t do it eith
er. And del -- later on, a number of years later, 
Atlanta got very fine restaura
nts and it built tremendous hotels a
nd what was expensive at tha -- 
at that time  turned out to be cheap because pr
ices went up and -- and Atlanta grew to be an 
international city, and they built
 a new airport and it is what it
 is today, you know, a big city.  
Q: When -- when did you get married? 

A: In 1961. 

Q: And how did you me et Ilsa? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
80 
 
A: We ll, I had worked in -- in upstate New York, in
 a place -- in a -- I 
was still in the Empire 
room and I connected with the owners of the 
Marc ie Hotel which was locat ed in Lake Placid, 
which is close to Canada. And at the end of 
the season -- it was a seas
onal operation al-also, the 
Marcie Hotel. It closed around 
September when the Empire room opened. But I had a few days 
off and I went to Mont real because ha ving live d in France and speaking Fr ench, Montreal was 
the ideal place to spend a couple 
of days, and I went to Montreal
 for a three day weekend and I 
met Ilsa, my  wife for -- who would become ultimatel
y my wife, met her in --  in Montreal . And --  
and the rest is more or less history, we -- she cam
e to visit me  in New York and we became very 

good friends and ultima tely -- 

Q: But how long did it take you to get ma rried? 

A: We ll, I -- that™s a very fine question -- 
that™s a very good question. I must have un -- 
unconscio -- unconsciously had -- I ha -- I had wi
thout knowing it, I -- by that time I was in my 
very, very early 30™s and I had become  accustom
ed to -- to -- I was -- probably I -- I was a 
bachelor  of sort, and I used to spend the summer
 in Europe and the -- the wer -- and th -- on one 
of those -- and in -- Ilsa and I, 
we were -- she was in Miami, a nd I was in Miami, but we were 
not ma rried at the time. And then one nice summe
r, she went to Las Vegas and returning from 
Europe, I called her up. But I noticed that her vo
ice was slightly distan
t, there was a kind of 
change of sorts had taken place. 
And naturally after we had been
 -- we were friends for four 
years, you know. So she must have said to he
rself, enough is enough, this guy™s got to ma ke up 
his mi nd. And she had met other friends. And I deci
ded right then and ther
e on the spur of the 
moment that this is it, my time has come, I™m 
ge tting ma rried. And we spent a few days in San 
Francisco and returned to Las Ve
gas. So we got married in Vega
s. In Vegas. Wa s a gamble, but 
it turned out -- turned out to be a winner. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
81 
 
Q: It [indecipherable] a gamble. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: We ™re going to have to change the tapes. 

A: Yeah. 
End of Tape Five

Beginning Ta pe Six  
Q: What did you do in Atlanta after 1975? 
A: Yeah, I had connections in the Wa ldorf, in the 
-- in the Empire room and at -- wh -- in which I 
had been a assistant ma itre™d. I had connections
 of people who -- who were connected to the 
Fairmont Hotel chain. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And wa -- one became food and begeda -- food 
and beverage director at the San Francisco 
Fairmont and from there moved to -- to Denver,
 to the -- and opened up the Denver Fairmont and 

ultimately ended up in Atlanta in -- and entertai
ned the position of resident ma nager. And he 
called me  in New York a-at which time  the Empi
re room was  on very thin ice because of the 
rising -- the ra -- the s
cale of the entertainment compensati
on, which the room could not sustain, 
with its limited amount of seating. And so we di
 -- he asked me  if I work -- if I would be 
considering taking over the Venetian room as a mana
ger. And I went to -- to Atlanta and stayed 
in the hotel for about two weeks and looked the si
tuation over. It appealed
 to me  and I kind of 
took the bait and not shortly afte
r that -- that period, we -- my  wife and our son -- meanwhile, we 

had Mark, our son, and we moved to Atlanta. Got 
a wonderful apartment at a significantly lower 
expense than the prevailing rent in Ne w York. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: And so much for that. I retained that job for,
 I think, some thing like four years. No, excuse 
me, two yea r s, at which time the Venetian room cl
osed, just simply closed from one day to the 
next because  of m -- mo re or less the same  pr
oblem that had pr eceded in New York, the high 
cost of entertainment. The -- we had a real kind of setback in the economy and the room was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

not -- was not profitable. The hotel -- the occupanc
y in the hotel was less than -- than 50 percent 
and that™s very, very bad for a hotel. Less 
than 96 percent is scr -- is going down. 
Q: Right. 

A: So the hotel -- the -- th
e -- the entire hotel left Atlanta. And 
I got -- my  next job, I got a job at 
the Atlanta Hilton in the banquet departme nt and I 
worked there for four years. Four years, until 
1975 -- until 19 -- excuse  me , until 1980. From ™ 75 to
 ™80 I worked in the -- in the Hilton. And 
then I followed -- I -- I me t a -- someone who had 
a catering business. And he
 wanted to join hi s 
two daughters in Baltimore and he was ready to 
sell the business for a ve
ry s-small amount of 
money. He just wanted some body qualified to car
ry on and so I took over his employees and 

bought into a established business that wasn™t doi
ng a great volume, but it was established in the 
sense that it was incorpor ated, 
and the name was Prestige Caterers
. And it turned out to be the 
golden goose. It -- it was a very successful operati
on. I -- and I fit right in, due to my e xperience 
in the kitchen and my connections in the dining 
room. I branched out what
 had been a strictly 
kosher catering business, I branched out and a
dvertised in the yellow 
pages and -- and became 
known in Atlanta as a -- I ma de a name  for myse lf
 there and it wa -- it was very, very good for a 
number of years. For a good number of years. In f
act, it -- it lasted until -- 
it lasted unti
l I retired. 
Q: And whe n did you retire?   

A: I retired in -- I think it wa
s ™86, at which time Ilsa, my wife , ran the place for another two 
years, but -- and then we closed it for good. 

Q: When did you -- 

A: We  closed it for good, actually, I™m wrong on my da
tes. We closed it, we
 -- we still were in 
business during the Olympics, which was a ma j or boost.
 The Olympics are, for us in our catering 
establishment, was a -- was a kind of revival of --
 of the nor -- of numbers. We  did -- we did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
84 
 
quite well for the Olympics. I had a customer wh
o took over the -- whatever we had to offer that 
is wa -- in terms of volume, we did quite well. Bu
t it wasn™t very long ther
e after that 
we closed 
up. 
Q: When did you become  Henry Gallant? 

A: When did I become  Henry Gallant?  I -- my 
time in the -- in the ho
tel school in Switzerland 
was a -- whe-when you speak of cooking, when 
you speak of food, it -- it has ma ny different 
outlet. Just as you have Italian and Chinese and 
German cuisine, Austrian, Swiss and so forth 

and so on, ea-each type of -- of cuisine, each type
 of food ha s its own -- its own quality and its 
own reputation and so forth, and -- and the chef
s -- that entire industry 
was -- was led by chefs 
from Switzerland, from Germany, from France and 
from Aus t ria. You mi ght safely say that 
those four countries, th -- Wol fgang Puck, w
ho™s very well known, his name  is a household 
word, not only in advertising for 
food, but also in advertising for 
the food equipment. You go to -
- to a depa rtme nt store and all of a sudden up pops
 his face. The Georgia A
quarium, he runs the -
- the catering departme nt and food departme nt 
of Georgia Aquarium. So his -- there are few 
people who don™t know Wolfgang Puck. He™s Austri
an, just like another fellow from Austria, 
very successful, Arnold Schwarzenegger, he™s Aust
rian. And he wasn™t always a movi e star, or 

he wasn™t always a governor. He was at one tim
e, a weightlifter and ma de his name  as Mr. 
Universe, if I™m not mi staken. So anyway, I, with
 a name like Goldstei n, it --  it identifi ed with 
professions that you would like to, or would not like to associate with, perhaps with law, with -- 

with furriers, with tailors, with 
textiles, with me dicine, with den
tistry and so forth and so on. In 
the kitchen, Americans in the 19 -- 
in the late 40™s and early 50™
s, you would have traveled the 
entire country from one ne -- from Buffalo to
 -- to San Francisco and you would not find an 
American -- an American chef. It just  simply
 was not an occupation that Americans, native 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
85 
 
Americans would -- would embrace. They just w
ouldn't. Unlike today, where the si tuation has 
turned 180 degrees, where you have this -- the Calif
ornia cuisine and -- and 
from the -- the TV 
shows featuring Julia Child and -- an-and Em
eril -- E-E-Emile -- what is his name?   
Q: E meril?  
A: Emeril, right, correct. They -- 
they -- they -- you see them ev
erywhere. And tha-that happened 
probably in that -- began to happen after Worl
d War II or something. There was a field that 
Americans became -- came to like and enjoy and -- and thrive in. But the name Goldstein was a 

li --  a st rong liability and also there was a great 
deal of anti-Semitism here in America. The -- the 

-- I worked -- for example, I -- the s -- New Yo
rk Culinary Federation sent me  to the Greenbrier 
at White Sulphur Springs. And th
e Greenbrier is a -- an instituti
on. It is a hotel that, like the 
Home stead in Virginia, it is a hotel that was th
e home  to senators and presidents and -- and the 
Duke and Duchess of Windsor and what have you.It was the elite, the so-called 500 and chief 

executive officers of the major Amer ican corpor
ations, they all spent thei r summers in the 
Greenbrier with Ben Hogan and -- and the top go
lfers, the golf tournaments. Anybody who was 
anybody went to the Greenbrier. But the Green
brier was owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio 
Railway company, by a fellow whose name  was  Young. His last name  was Young, the first name  

I do not recall, and the hotel was notably restrict
ed. It did not have Jewish employees and it did 
not have Jewish clientele, simple as that. Clea
r and simple. And I alread
y had been there and in 
the office they categor ically told me  that -- an offi
ce girl, a very nice gi rl told me that the -- if I 
were smart I would change my na me  because w
ith a name  like Goldstein you wouldn™t last in 

this hotel. And I took her advice and I changed my 
na me  at that time. I did not change my na me  
legally until a number of years later. I had replied 
to an ad in the New York Time s whi c h read -- 
I had always had the desire to travel. Traveli
ng was an -- a -- I would 
say it was a passion. It -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
86 
 
ma ybe because I traveled in the early stage of my life, I don™t know, but I enjoyed traveling and 
so when I saw that ad by Pan American Airlin
es, which meanwhile has --
 doesn™t fly any more, 
but -- they joined Eastern Airlines
, it doesn™t fly either. But Pa n American had an ad in the paper, 
wanted, young ma n between 31 and 35 as flight atte
ndant, capable of ta
lking two languages. 
Well, I said to myself, I speak French, I speak Ge
rman. I™m i deal -- a -- an ideal candidate as 

flight attendant. I submitted my resumé  and at 
-- was called to a meeting in -- with the executive 
flight board. And 10 days later I 
got a letter, dear Mr. Goldstein 
-- I was so shocked that I still 
reme mber the wording of the letter, dear Mr. 
Goldstein. As we  told you upon your interview, 
your qualifications are not best suited for our spec
ialized requirements and this however is in no 
way to indicate your scope of ability and wishing you every success for the future, we rema in 

cordially yours, W.J. Pa rrot, superintendent of 
flight service. Now, it happened that in nine -- 

that was in 1956, and it happened that wa -- Israel
 was at war with the -- with the Arabs, and 
Lebanon -- and I was supposed to fly Beirut, Rome
, Paris, London, Beirut. I was supposed to be 
stationed -- they -- they asked me , are you ready 
to stay one year overs
eas and -- and live in 
Beirut?  I said, that™s no problem. Bu
t I didn™t know that 
the -- this -- I -- I -- 
in ot her words, I was 
a victim of t he political situation 
at the time. And I was not a candida
te to live in Beirut. And so I 
got this letter, which did no dimi nish my desire 
to travel and I worked -- began working on resort 
-- on crui se ships.  

Q: Mm. 

A: I worked initially on cr uise ships. But that 
was not the easiest thing to accomplish, because in 
order to work on cruise ships you had to have a certificate of ma rine -- you had to have a Coast 

Guard document. And you could only get a Co
ast Guard document if
 you had a job. And you 
could only get a job if you had a Coast Guard 
document. And the only way to come  to a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
87 
 
document like that was to accept a job for the milita
ry sea transport service, which I did and I 
traveled between New York and Bremerhaven fo
r a few mo nths, and then joined the National 
Maritime Union and worked for Grace Line. And 
that took me  to -- to New York, Cristóbal, 
through the Panama  Canal, to Guayaquil, Ecuado
r. From there to Buena Ventura, Columbia, 
with the destination of Kayahu, Lima , Peru. And I 
did this until I went to the Empire room, the 
rest was history.  
Q: How do you think the Holocaust affected you?
 We ll, your experiences
, I shouldn™t say the 
Holocaust as a whole, cause it™s not -- 

A: Well, the Holocaust --  the Holocaust affected 
me , the Hol ocaust wasn™t a -- I can only answer 
that it was a disaster for the Jewish people, and 
whatever affects the Jewish people affects me . I 

mean, we lost six million -- fi ve million of our brothe
rs and sisters and so it a
ffected me a lot. It -
- it made me  think, it ma de me -- it had a lot of 
consequences. I speak on ma
tters of the -- of the 
Holocaust at the Bremen Museum of Jewish Her
itage and Holocaust Histor
y. I speak to students. 
I am a speaker at -- under the jo -- jor -- Georgi
a Commission of the Holo
caust. I™m a speaker to 
educate young people that divi sion and -- and rejec
ting di versity and for mi norities is -- is a very 
bad thing, and to be a bystander is equally bad, and that we all have an obligation to -- to be 

active in preventing the onset
 of the result of discri
mi nation. Pure and simple. 
Q: So you fe el you have an obligation. 

A: I -- absolutely. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Absolutely. I think I have an 
obligation, I -- it™s a kind of mi racl
e that I™m alive, I -- that I 
ma naged to be five mi nutes ahead of the Nazis. 
And if not for that good fortune or that luck, or 
call it whatever you will, if not for that I would ha
ve ended up in the crem
atorium of Auschwitz.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
88 
 
Q: How doe s that ma ke you feel? 
A: Well, itmakes me fe el --it 
makes me feel as -- as a luck
y guy, chosen for some thing, I don™t 
know what. Maybe to speak
 to these young people. 
Q: Do you like speaking to these kids? 

A: I do it out of the sense of respons
ibility, to what extent I am -- I™m 
not sure that -- that -- I like 
to do my -- the things that I have 
to do, that I feel
 I have to do. 
Q: So not necessarily like it.  

A: No, not necessarily, it™s not my
 vocation, I -- to be a public sp
eaker. I don™t like to see myself 
necessarily standing on the stag
e and -- although some ti me s it™s e
nviable, depends on -- on what 
you speak about, to whom you speak, who your audience 
is, I mean, in some  aspect I think it™s -- 
it could be a lot of fun. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The subject ma tter is not
 so very entertaining. 
Q: Right. 

A: As it is a responsibility and a 
necessity, but not so ve
ry enjoyable. But if the subject changes 
from evening to evening, as it does for Bill O™Re
illy, if you will, it could 
be fun to -- it coul d be 
fun to talk to different people, interv
iew them, speak to them, exchange ideas. 
Q: Is there anything you want to
 say that we haven™t been 
able to talk about today? 
A: Not really. I thank you for the 
opportunity. I enjoyed speaking to you. 
Q: We ll, I enjoyed speaking with you, too. 

A: And I was keenly attentive 
to your questions and I did my 
best trying to answer them. 
Q: We ll, I think you did very well. I th
ank you very much for talking with me . 
A: A pleasure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528

Q: Thank you. 
A: Thank you. [tape break] -- the resu
lt is going to be less than -- 
[tape break] 

Q2: Can you tell us about this picture? 

A: Yes. On the extreme right there is a pictur e of
 my mother and sitting next to her with the -- 
smoking a pipe, is my fa ther.  

Q: And whe r e was this? 

A: On the S.S. Saint Louis, on the way to Havana, Cuba, as evidenced by the fact that this is a 

happy occasion. I see ba lloons and decorations, so itwas a -- a joyful occasion. We  didn™t have 

that kind of thing on the way back. 

Q2: And this picture? 

A: That evidently is the same occasion, just a 
di fferent location in that hall and the second young 
fellow from the right, that™s me . Yours truly. 
Q: When you were Heinz. 
A: When I was Heinz. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

Q2: And this picture? 

A: This is -- the man that you™re pointing at  
is Morris Tr oper, T-r-o-p-e-r  Troper, who is 

working for an American Jewish organization an
d he has accomplished finding an asylum for us, 
because everybody looks so happy. I™m the fellow in the fore -- yes, exactly, that™s me . And the 

woma n next to him is his wife, on the -- 

Q: Here?  

A: No, th-the lady next to Troper. No, on the other end.

Q2: In the ha t 
A: In the -- the hat -- one more. 

Q: Here?  

A: Yes.  

Q: Okay. 

A: That™s his wife. 

Q: Sorry. 

Q2: And who is this? 

A: This is a -- a German educator who had a 
very large school, a boarding school in Germany 
and who fled from the Nazis because as Goebbe ls
 put it, no longer a country of poets and of -- 
some thing like that. In other words, he was an
 educator and he then moved to Switzerland and 
began a school where he -- where a lot of Jewi
sh refugees would find asylum or whatever you 
want to call it. His name  was Paul Geheeb a
nd he was a friend of Mahatma  Gandhi. We ll, his 
whole looks, you know, he looked as he -- you just 
see, he looks like he just came back from 
Woodstock. He was 50 years ahead of his time. 

Q2: And where did this pictur e appear? 

A: In li -- this is ﬁLifeﬂ ma gazine of May -- May 6
th
, 1946, or May 13, 1946.  
Q2: And what™s this? 

A: Yeah, well that™s also 
ﬁLifeﬂ ma gazine of May 6
th
, 1946 and in this pictur
e, still under the -- 
the -- the school that Paul Geheeb, the German e du
cator left, escaping from 
the Nazis, he -- I am 
in -- in the dining room, running th
e kitchen and passing food to the ki
ds who are th -- in -- who 
are sitting there. And the picture below that is
 -- on the right is -- on the left  -- n-no, where you 
going to be? Oh -- oh, there?  Oh, no 
that™s -- that is the nephew of 
the German chief of staff of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0528  
91 
 
the entire German military. In other words, 
his na me  is Hans von Brauchitsch and the von 
Brauchitsch name  is a -- von Brauchitsch was the ch
ief of staff of the German ar my. And next to 
him is -- is me , we were buddies, we were friend
s. And he was in this school as a student in 
Switzerland because hi s -- his father, who is th
e br other of the German chief of staff, 
[indecipherable] Nazi, was ma rried to a Jewish
 woma n. And under the Ge
rman Nuremberg laws, 
racial intermarriage was forbidden, but the Na
zis did not want the embarrassment of ha ving a 
high up German general in this kind of a relati
onship, so they allowed the two nephews to 
emigrate to Switzerland. Which by the way, Swit
zerland was neutral duri
ng World Wa r II. [tape
