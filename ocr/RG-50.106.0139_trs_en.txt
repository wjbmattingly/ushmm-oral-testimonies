A: I was born in 1928, July the ninth. 
Q: You™ve already gone in detail in your pr
evious interview, so before we begin, I 
will summarize some o -of your experiences.
 You came from a large, religiously 
observant family, of which you were the 
sixth of seven children, and you had many 
extended relatives. When the Germans occu
pied the town in  1944, you and your 
family were forced into a 
ghetto and th en after one or two months transported by 
cattle car to 
Auschwitz
. You and your sister 
Sylvia
, who was three and a half years 
older than  you were in 
Auschwitz
 for five weeks. And the other members there of 

your family did not surv ive. Then w
ith a group of 1,0
00 girls, you and 
Sylv ia
 were 
taken to 
Germany
 to  work  in an ammunition factor
y, being exposed to the burning 
gun powder. You were 
then transported to 
Bergen-Belsen
 where you were 
liberated by the British on April 15
th
, 1945. Before we contin
ue, I™d like to clarify 
some things. How would you 
describe yourself as a ch
ild? This is, of course, 
before the war. Were you 
very independent, were yo
u physically strong? Ho w 
would you -- what woul
d you say you were? 
A: Well, I think I was very strong and th
at probably saved my  life when  I got to 
Auschwitz
.  
Q: Were you very  independent? 

A: Well, when you™re in a family of
 seven, you got to be independent. 
Q: Did you have a close rela
tionship with your sister 
Sylvia
 before the war?

A: Yes. We were a close-knit family. I 
was very close to my whole family.  
Q: Mm-hm. And with your 
parents, before conditions got worse, were they the 
kind of people that you c
ould talk things over with? 
A: Abso lutely. Now looking back on it, I 
think my  parents were trying to  hide 
many things from me, that th
ings will get better. I mean
, I remember when they 
were saying, honey, don™t wo rry. Things will get better.  
Q: When
 Hitler
 came into power in 1933 and 
until the Germans occupied your -- 
your country, did your lif
e change in any way? Pr
eceding the time th at the 
Germans occupi
ed your town. 
A: Well, 
Czechoslovakia
 became
 Hungaria
 in 1939. It had ch anged somewhat, 
but not to th e extent wh at has happen
ed in 19 f -- when
 the Germans came. 
Q: So life went on for you, relatively the same? 

A: Not the same at all. Was not -- 

Q: What -- what were some of the changes? 
A: Well, I think the Jewish kids did not 
have the same opportunity going to  school 
as the non-Jewish kids, where -- and I 
lived  under the Czechs, my  uncle was a 
Czech officer, and after we™ll be finished
 with this interview, I™ll show you a 
picture of him. So th-that -- that we lost. 
And we started sort of
 educating ourselves 
on our own. What happened was we were 
allowed to go to school, but we wal -- 
we had to  sit in the back and we were neve
r called on. So  wh at my  father did is he 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

got a -- a teacher and we -- we s -- he -- 
he -- he was teaching us. And after awhile, 
the whole communities, you know, the Jewish
 kids came to our house. So when a -
- I think back, I feel like our 
house became the school, actually. 
Q: What was it like for you as a young pe
rson to experience anti-Semitism? W h at 
did it mean to you as a young ch ild?  

A: Well, when you™re you
ng you don™t understand a lot 
of things. Here you had 
friends today and tomo rrow you lo st them
, and you wondered why. And that was 
very painful for me. 

Q: And did you talk this 
over with your -- your sib
lings or your parents?  
A: We did. We constantly talked about it 
because we worried about it. But we were 
always living in hope that things will get 
better, but they didn't get better, they got 
worse. 

Q: Did you know earlier that -- what was ha
ppening to the Jews in other countries, 
before the germ -- like all of this is be
fore the German occupation of your town. 
Did you know what was happening?  
A: Well, you know, we had a radio and th
at was taken away from us. So people, 
some people took a chance in keep ing th
eir radios, but you could have been 
punished  for it. So we gave our radio aw
ay. But there was some
 people took the -- 
a chance on keeping it, so duri
ng the night they  would be
 listening to the news. So 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

the news would come through, but we -- 
we -- we couldn™t understand, we didn™t 
understand how severe the tragedy was.  
Q: Did you have any other interests? You 
were still young, but 
besides school, did 
you -- mu sic or reading, anything th-tha
t you did to occupy your time besides 
schoolwo rk? 

A: Constantly reading. Matter of fact, 
I loved books and well, actually our house 
al-always was full of books. And I had a littl
e brother, he was six years old, and he 
had a little book, they called it ﬁ
A ll of Base,ﬂ
 it™s a 
ABC
 book and poor kid, he 
was carrying this book w
ith him until he came to 
Auschwitz
 and they told him to 
throw this little book into a -- the -- the pit 
there. It was very difficult for him, he 
cried a lot about it, but --  
Q: And when it was time for you to have 
to  wear a yellow star, what were your 
feelings about that? 

A: My feelings were awful. I feared fo
r every minute. At that time, no matter how 
my parents wanted to protect me, it just 
was right there in front of me. I could no 

longer -- I™ll -- I™ll never forg
et that. I -- my uncle gave 
me a quarter to go and get 
myself ice cream, to a place wh
ere I used to go and get th
is ice cream, it was a big 
treat for a child. And I got there -- at a certain time, we co uldn™t walk out of the 

house, I believe it was between five and si
x. And I got there, 
they told me they

cannot sell me the ice cream 
because I was a Jewish child. Came home crying and 
I didn™t understand it. So the pain was there. 
Q: So what do older relatives say to
 children your age to comfort them? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: You -- wha-what did your relatives 
say to comfort you wh en th ese things 
h a pp en ed ? 

A: There was very little to comfort me beca
use everything was staring in my face. 
How -- what could they say to me when 
a little kid comes home crying they didn't 
get a ice cream, even though I had 
my quarter. It was -- it was sad. 
Q: Yeah. Was the yellow star se
wn on your coat, or pinned? 
A: Yes. No, on my arm. 

Q: It -- it w as an armband? 

A: An armband, yes.  

Q: While you were in the ca
mp s, you had said that y
our sister kept you going. 
Where do you th ink she got her strength 
from? What do you attribute that to? 
A: Well, when we parted in 
Auschwitz
, I don™t know if I should mention 
Auschwitz
, how we parted. Can I an -- 
Q: Abso lutely. 

A: Well, when we got to 
Auschwitz
, we came with the whole family and my -- 
you know, my  parents -- but 
the two older brothers were
 taken away  already fo r

work, to s-s -- t -- t-to the 
Ru ssian front wh ere they were picking mines. And my  
father, and I had an older 
sister, and sh e took care of my  grandmother, and my  
grandfather came and my little brother and my
 mother and my sist
er that survived. 
In 
Auschwitz
 they pushed my  mother with my  sister because she looked fairly 
young, but they pulled my 
little brother out of her hand
. So my mother heard him 
cry, so she ran back to  him and pleaded 
with the Germans to -- to let her go with 
my little brother and they beat her up, and 
after she was bleeding,
 and they kicked 
her into the left lane. A nd sh e was scre
aming, please tell the world what is 
happening to us, if you survive. Try to su
rvive. Actually her 
words were like that, 
try to surviv e, and if you 
do, tell the wo rld wh at happened here. And of course, you 
know, my  grandfather also had a terrible e
xperience there. I don™t know if I can go 
on talking about it. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Can I talk about it? 
Q: Whatever you wish. 
A: Okay. Well, my grandfather came -- 
well, they took him from home. He -- he 
had the Torah scroll with him, because 
when  they closed  our synagogues, he 
managed to take out a Torah scroll. So 
our house became a school and I think his 
house became a house of worship. And wh en
 they told  us we have to leave the 
house, he took the Torah scroll 
with him. And wh en we got to 
Auschwitz
, he came

down from the train with this  Torah scroll and they made 
-- they -- they 
told him to 
-- to throw the Torah scroll in
to the ditch and he wouldn™
t do that, so you know, he 
-- they were beating on him and we ran ov
er to him and pleaded with him, please, 
please throw the Torah scroll down and he just wouldn™t do it and they kept on 
beating on him and then  th -- 
they really -- you know, they  beat him to death and 
right in front of us he fell with the Torah scrolls, and -- so we saw this tragedy right 

in front of us, and I think in -- that™s wh
at f -- then they took my grandfather and 
they threw him in a truck. And I think she 
kept that in mind all the time, that she 
needs -- she has a need to te
ll this to someone. And that -- I think that -- that made 
her stronger, to say I have 
to survive to tell 
it to someone what happened, because I 
don™t think they™ll believe it. 

Q: Were there any other examples of 
women helping other women in the camp 
while you were there? Can you -- do you know
 of any other situa
tions? Your sister, 
of course, helped you. Did you see that 
relationship between any other women, or 
other wo men to you? 
A: Well, you mu st understand, when people 
are put in a situation where survival is 

the only thing, so it was very difficult to he
lp each other because 
we were all in the 
same boat, with the same thing. But we
 -- we did try. You know, if we saw 
somebody fainted we were there for them
, of course. But there was nothing we 
really can do to help  them, they probabl
y, you know, th ey were fainting out of

hunger or -- or weakness. And it was -- it wa s very, very difficult. It wasn™t that 
one had more than the other to
 be able to help each othe
r, it wasn™t like that. When 
my sister tried keepin g me alive when I was giving up
, she just gave away her little 
piece of bread. You know, she like bribed me, 
sort of, to -- to want to -- to want to 
surv -- you know, that I should surv ive. Bu
t I -- I -- I think wh at happened  to me, I 
emotionally did not want to do it any mo re
. And a -- and a -- of course, I was very 

weak because I had to work so 
hard  in the munition factory. 
Q: Mm-hm. When you were 
in -- in the camp s, did you talk about wh at was going 
on with the other wo men, outside of your sister? 

A: We saw it. We were right there 
with them, we were in one barrack. 
Q: But I meant, did you exchange feeli
ngs with each other, the other women? 
A: I think everybody was 
just numb , and everybody -- everybody just didn™t 
understand what is happeni
ng because we -- we weren™t 
treated as human beings 
any more. So -- 
Q: Were you with women from your to wn
, or were you with wo men from other 
town -- towns and village
s when you were in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: When I was in 
Auschwitz
, the time when I was in 
Auschwitz
, I was there with 
a lady and my  next door neighbor and 
her daughter. And I don™t rememb er, 
somebody else there. But th
en when they took us to
 work they took them 
someplace else and they took me and my sister someplace else.

Q: What -- what was the -- or -- the name 
of the munitions fact
ory? Do you know 
where -- where in 
Germany
 it was, or what the name was? 
A: I really don™t. I should really find out 
because it™ll -- probably I have to -- I -- I -
- I -- I™ve -- I™m going to try 
to find out where it was, but I don™t think it was far 
from 
Bergen-Belsen. 
It wasn™t far from 
Bergen-Belsen
, but I don™t reme -- I-I just 
don™t know, you know. I don™t know.  
Q: Now, you were almost 17 years old when you were liberated by the British. Did 
you know what those tanks 
meant when you saw them at
 the time o f -- the British 
tanks? What -- what did it mean to you to see them? 
A: Well -- well let me tell you first what pos
ition we were in. We -- we were full of 
life, we were thrown in with
 other people that were ha
lf dead, and i -- I was burned 
up from the m -- from -- from the 
spring
 stuff. From the gunpo wder, or whatever, I 
-- I remember it was yellow and very hot 
and while I was filling these bombs, you 

know, of course some of it went on top of
 me. So we were really like half dead. 
But my  sister, you know, she 
noticed them first. And I 
sa -- you know, so she tells 
me, you know, there are some tanks out th
ere and they  don™t look like they™re 
German tanks. So I said to her, you know, 
maybe this is the end and things will be 
better. So she says, it™ll be probably be be
tter for the world, but for us it™s too late. 
So when the Germans came, we
 really didn™t have the strength to be happy and -- 
Q: When the British came, yeah. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
11
A: When the British came, that my -- yeah
. They came a little bit too late for m -- 
actually for a lot of people. My -- when th
ey came my si ster was al r eady sick in 
that room, I remember she was deliri
ous. And then the British opened up the 
barracks, and when  they lo
oked into the ba
rracks, it was terrible because they 
wouldn™t let us out to th e bathrooms. 
Everybody was doing everything they  needed 
at -- in the barracks and a l -- a lot of them 
were very sick. It ju
st -- they opened -- 
they probably though
t it was worse -- it was -- really 
was worse than a crazy house. 
So they  were asking us what they can do fo r 
us, and th ey tried very hard to help us, 
but as I said, it was a little too late. They to
ok my sister and I di
dn™t know where sh 
-- they took her. So she didn
™t return a few days, I went
 out to look fo r her because 
at that ti -- after the English came
 in they posted names who died in 
Bergen-
Belsen
 and I couldn™t find her. Bu
t the sight I™ve seen in 
Bergen-Belsen
 I still have 
nightmares about it.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: These big mountains of -- of corpse a
nd everything. An yway, I couldn™t find my  
sister™s name, but in the meantime I fell 
somewheres there on the street. I -- I don™t 
reme mb er how they  picked me up and how 
I got to the hospital. They took me to 

the hospital but I don™t reme mb er nothing of th at. 
[phone ringing] 
Q: What languages did you speak then? Wh
at -- what did you 
understand? Did you 
understand German at th
at point, or English? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
12
A: No, we spoke -- we spok
e j -- Yiddish and Czech. 
Q: So when the British came,
 you did not understand them. 
A: No, I -- we didn't. No, I didn™t. But 
-- but you know, you co
uld see that they 
wanted to help us. 

Q: How could you tell? 

A: Oh, because they acted di
fferent than the Nazis did. 
Q: In what way? 
A: They acted like human beings, where th
e Nazis acted like they were monsters, 
in every which way. In every wh ich way. 
Q: Did you, at the -- at that point th
ink about going back to your hometown? 
A: Not when  I got sick
, when -- I-I was in 
Bergen-Belsen
 for a few weeks in the 
hospital because I got typhoid, it™s a high fever, and -- 

Q: What was your physical cond
ition at the time of liberation? 
A: Horrible. It wa -- you know, I -- best to describe me as I looked like a skeleton 
with a heartbeat. I mean, in a short -- 
it was awful the way I looked like. You 
know, I weighed -- I don™t even  know 
how mu ch I weig h -- I -- I was like a 
skeleton taken out of the earth. 

Q: Di-Did you know what
 you looked like? Could -- did you ever see yourself? 
A: Of course, I-I was so weak
, I couldn™t -- I coul
dn™t breathe, I couldn™t eat, I mi -
- I mean I couldn™t eat, and I was sick, youknow, I got sick. Got sick. I don™t even 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

remember how I got to the ho spital, I just fell there fro -- on the street and what 
happened was the ambul
ances were going around the s 
-- these s -- the street -- on 
the streets and whoever, yet whoever™s hear
t w as beating, even 
though they looked 
like they are dead, they were
 picking them up and trying to save them. And so I 
wound up in the hospital and I-I just -- 
after many, many weeks -- I remember 
asking for my sister, not for my family, be
cause I -- I w as just 
heartbroken that she 
was tr -- you know, she didn™t want to s -- sh
e would tell me that I have to surviv e 
because she doesn™t want to stay -- be 
alone. And after all that, I found myself 
alone. So  I was crying all the time and they
 asked me why -- you know, I™m crying. 

I says, I had a sister and sh e died here and I wa -- in 
Bergen-Belsen
. So they really 
put an effort in to look 
whether she™s dead or she™
s some place. And you know, 
they found her in another hospital. They  
had these makeshift hospitals and she was 
very weak and I was very weak a
nd sick, but they put us together. 
Q: What was that like to -- to 
get togeth er with her again? 
A: It was like giving someone life, because I again didn™t think 
[indecipherable]
 
surviving. You know, even 
though I was liberated, I st
ill -- because I knew what 
happened . I -- I didn't want to believe 
it too much, but we knew already what 
happened, so -- 

Q: You were saying that your sister 
Sylvia
 had said that you,
 Helen
, had to  stay 
alive because she didn™t want to be al
one. Can you talk a little
 more about that?

A: Well, one day I just didn't  want to go out to the
 c™est l™appel 
because I just 
didn™t have the strength and it was cold. So I was laying there and she saw not 
getting up, she lifted me up an
d she start ed shaking me. So
 I thought that she went 
crazy or something. And sh e says, you kno
w, you™re not going to  leave me alone. 
And because she knew by th e time she would 
come back, I -- they
 would do away 
with me. And I got up and I went to the 
c™est l™appel
 and she was trying to hold 
onto me so I shouldn™t collapse out there 
and dragged me to work  and then sh e 
came to help me out. Sh e was running ba
ck  and fo rth and I didn't think she™ll 
survive, you know, to
 help me a little bit, hard 
job. And that™s how it went. 
Q: Before the war, did you -- di-did she ex
hibit these -- this strength that she had 
during th e war, in any way? Were there a
ny situations pre-war that she showed 
how strong she was? 

A: Ye -- I think she -- she -- she did show 
some strength, but I really don™t think 
that that would have kept 
her alive. I think it™s the idea of what she saw and the 
message from my mother, I th
ink that kept her alive. I 
-- I really think so, cause I 
saw stronger people and ju st not the su -- not survive. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So when
 you and she were together
, did you talk about going 
back home? 

A: In the hospital? 

Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

A: We didn™t know what we want to do
. But what happened 
was the Swedish Red 
Cross agreed on taking in
 the very sick ones to 
Sweden
 and we were lucky and we 
were picked because we were very
 sick. And thenwhen we got to 
Sweden
, I -- 
there was another shocker, fo
r me anyway, because I thi
nk I almost lost my o -- 
belief in humanity. And when 
they took over, I -- again, I 
hate to repeat myself, I 
looked like -- I still looked lik
e a skeleton because I was so
 sick, and they nurtured 
me, they bathed me, they fed me, I had no
 strength to eat. And I was looking at 
them that maybe they™re not on this earth, th
ey -- they -- that th
ey -- they just came 
from heaven or something. It™s hard to de
scribe. It is very hard to describe my 
feeling when I got to 
Sweden
. I -- every time, every day I get up, I bless them, 
cause you know, I -- I think that if I would 
have to take care of my self and I would 
have a normal life, I wouldn™t want to
 take of me, because the way I looked. 
Q: When -- before you left for
 Sweden,
 had you and your sister ever talked about 
going to 
Palestine
? Did -- was that something impor
tant to you or your family? 
A: Well, the f -- the thi ngs that I remember in 
Europe
, they had th e
 chalutzim, 
they called these kids 
chalutzim
, but don™t forget, we were -- I-I was next to the 
youngest, which was six years old and then  
she was, so my father was trying to get 
the older ones to i -- to 
Israel, 
but i-i-i -- you know, it wa
s closed. Y-You had to 
wait for a quota, you know. Ou -Ou-Ou r -- ou
r life was like, you know, they -- how 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

shall I say? There was no pl
ace to go. Even we knew the 
horrible things, but there 
was nothing to do 
and no place to go. 
Q: Had your parents, pre-war, been strong Zionists? 
A: Yes, they have. Even though they we
re religious, but they
 have, yeah, yeah. 
Yeah. 
Q: So, let™s talk 
a little bit about 
Sweden
 now. So there you are with your sister. 
Are you with anybody else that you 
knew, pre-war or during the war? 
A: Yeah, it was so funny. I was in 
Sweden
 -- wi -- the 
[indecipherable]
 I-I -- 
when I was in be -- I have to 
backtrack a little. When I was in 
Bergen-Belsen
 
looking for my -- for my si
ster, I saw a man that was pulled by th e ankles, because 
they thought he was dead. And I took 
a look at him and I -- it looked like my  
cousin, an d I was yelling to  him
, Freddie, Freddie
 and he opened  up his eyes. But 
of course then I collapsed, I don™t rememb
er anything. So when I saw my sister, I 
says, you know, I -- 
Freddie
 is alive and he -- he -- I saw him 
Bergen-Belsen
, they 
were pulling him on that mountain with th
e dead. She says, oh, you were sick, you 
don™t know what you™re talking about. So  at 
this point I really don™t know wh ether 
it was 
Freddie
 or it wasn™t 
Freddie
. He was the one that was very sick and they 
took him to 
Sweden 
too, and we met him th ere in 
Sweden
. 
Q: What -- what was it like to see 
another me mb er of your family?

A: Oh, you -- you wouldn™t be
lieve that. His name was 
Milbauer
 and our name 
was 
Lebowitz.
 So when we met him, we were so
 scared that we™re going to be 
separated again that he says, I™m going to become 
Lebowitz
 and they™re not going 
to separate me. So what happened was he became 
Lebowitz, 
he says he is 
Lebowitz
 and we were there together as 
Lebowitz™s. 
But then my  sister found me 
in the papers in -- in 
Brooklyn
. They took our names and they asked us whether 
we have anybody out of 
Euro pe 
and I knew I had a sister. 
So, she found us in the 
papers, but --  
Q: When had this -- what was your sister™s name in 
Brooklyn? 
A: My sister™s name in  
Brooklyn
, 
Arler. 
But wi -- she was mar -- 
Q: Her first -- her first name? 

A: First name was
 Frances. 

Q: And -- and when  did 
Frances 
leave to go to the 
United Sta tes
? 
A: Just before the war in 1938. I had an
 uncle there and we were begging to  be, 
you know, taken out, but he 
didn™t want to -- you know, he
 couldn™t take out nine 
people, because it was -- you know, it was very
 difficult. So he took my sister out.

B.
 And you were talking about
 how your sister was in 
Brooklyn
, and you and your 
-- and you and your sister
 Sylvia
 was in -- were in 
Sweden. 
A: Right. So then sh e sent us affidavits
. Now here is the prob
lem with my cousin, 
bec -- he -- he was 
Lebowitz
 and he had a -- a -- a aunt in -- i -- also in
 Brooklyn. 
So her name was 
Milbauer
. So  there was a big problem because he had to ch ange 
his name in
 Sweden
 to
 Milbauer
 in order for them to se
nd an affidavit. So he 
remained in
 Sweden 
fo r awhile, and th en that aunt of his sent him an affidavit and 
he came out to the 
United States
. 
Q: When you were in 
Sweden
, and you were with other survivors who were being 
taken care of the way you were being take
n care of, did you and they talk about 
what your wartime ex periences were? Did 
you share with others what you and 
your family had gone th
rough while you -- during the 
war, while you were in 
Sweden
? 
A: Actually no, because -- I didn™t talk 
about it for a long time. It was very 
difficult. It was very, very, very di
fficult. And then wh
en we were in 
Sweden
 a-
after we were in that sanitarium, I -- we 
felt better, of course. They  fed us and they 
made u -- you know, they gave us dark be
er, I reme mb er. A -- you know, just to 
gain some weight. And then we got s -- I 
got separated from my sister and I wasn™t 
so happy about it, but they were explaining
 me and reassuring me that I was -- they 
says I was under-aged and I have to go to 
a school, and my sister went to work. But 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

they treated her very nice. 
I mean, they paid her for 
her work, and -- and life was 
very good in is -- in 
Sweden. 
Q: So di -- di -- you did not live with 
her once you got out of the hospital? 
A: No. I was in 
Fielgarden
 and she was in 
Göteborg. 
Q: And how did you stay 
in contact with her? 
A: Oh, we -- we could -- you know, we co
uld write to each other. We had our i -- 
we lived normal, you know, it was a normal 
life, you know, to ea
ch other. And she 
knew wh ere I was and I knew where she was and -- 

Q: Was it hard to be away from he
r after all youhadbeen through? 
A: Very. Very. But you know what happened 
to us, all the girls? I mean, all th ese 
girls that I was with in school, I don™
t remember how many we were there -- 
Q: This is school in 
Sweden
? 
A: Right. In
 Fielgarden
. And we became lik e sister
s, an d we -- you know, 
everybody lost everything, so we would 
say to  each other, you know, we™re going 
to be sisters now. And we di
d th ings togeth er and we we
re -- I think we were ev -- 
trying to  be even closer than sister
s, you know. So it was wonderful, it was 
wonderful. Our teachers were great. They 
-- they tried being lik
e our parents, more 
or less, too. 
Q: Did you live in a dormitory or in people™s homes? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
20
A: No, I lived in a dormito
ry, yeah. Bu t we were maybe seven, eight kids in a 
dormitory, but -- but there were -- you know,
 there -- more -- there were a lot -- a 
lot of kids. It was like a house and it had 
these different rooms, yeah. It was -- 
Q: And -- and what did you 
-- did you study Sw edish, or
 English? Wh at did you 
study? 
A: I studied English and Hebrew, and ev
erything else, math and all these other 
things that ne -- you know, that I missed. 
Q: Who were the teachers? 
A: The teachers were also survivors a
nd they were teachers before, and they 
volunteered to do th at. Of course they were
 taken care of, they g -- you know, they 
had shelter and fo od. They ga
ve us -- you know, they fed 
us very nicely and it was 
a beautiful place.  

Q: Did they teach you Swedish at all? 

A: Not really. We tried talking Swedish so
rt of, but i-i-it -- it -- it w asn™t -- I th ink 
they had other plans for us. I don™t know if th
e Swedish at that time took us in to  be 
their citizens. I think they took us in th
ere to take care of us, but I don™t even 
reme mb er or I don™t even know what 
the deal was with 
them. I don™t know. 
Q: Now, at that time, did you and your sist
er talk about going ba
ck to your town at 
all? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
21
A: Sa -- some people did try to  tell us that
 it would be nice if we would come back. 
But we -- we really felt in our hearts that 
we have no place ther
e. We hadno place 
there. 
Q: And what made you think that? 
A: Well, all that that we had to go th
rough from 1939 til -- to -- until the Germans 
came. I mean, it wasn 't just the Germans, 
it was how our life ch
anged ev en before 
the Germans. See, 
Cze choslovakia
 was sort of a -- tried to be a democracy in 
Euro pe
. But the rest of the countries were 
-- you know, everybody made their own 
rules and their own laws, especially in 
the war. It wa -- y ou know, we knew we -- 

we -- we were pointed out as Jews, that 
we are not wanted there, but we had no 
place to go. The world was closed for us. 

Q: Did you feel Czech at that time, or
 Jewish? How would you have described 

yourself?  

A: Well, I was very small in
 30 -- how old was I in ™39? 
Q: 11. 

A: 11. Well, I knew that I™m Jewish because
 I -- I -- I -- y ou know, as I said, that 

we had -- we -- we -- we were religious. 
But I loved being where I was, in the 
position I was in, because I had a big family
, I had my own support system, and I -- 
I -- I -- we didn™t experience the anti-Se
mitism that much, beca
use a Jewish child

could, if -- if he was really
 smart, he could reach to be educated. Bu t later on it was 
closed completely. 
Q: Oh. So you -- you felt Czech
 also, besides being Jewish? 
A: Oh, definitely. If anything I -- I wanted 
to  be Czech and nobo
dy else -- I mean, I 
-- I was Jewish and I always feel like I wa
nt to be Jewish. Bu t the Czech, yes, but 

not the rest of them.  

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And then wh
en I -- it became a part of 
Hungary, 
did you feel 
any Hungarian connection? 

A: We -- not -- it™s hard for me to expl
ain because I was a child and I was trying 
not to be -- I mean, y-y-you know, in a child 
you so rt of try to see the bright side of 
it, see? But you know, I couldn™t help f
eeling that I was not accepted. The only 
thing I think that really saved me is becau
se, you know, my large family, as a child. 
I didn™t feel -- I didn™t need the outside to
 accept me and love me because my  own 
family did that for me. 
Q: How long were you in 
Sweden
, you and your sister? 
A: I was there over a year, yeah. 
Q: And then you said your -- your aunt 
tried to arrange for you to come to the 
United States
? 

A: My s -- my sister. 

Q: I™m sorry, your sister. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
23
A: My sister. And th en it took no time, 
I think we were the first ones from the 
survivors to come 
out here to the 
United States
. I think it took her maybe four or 
five, a half a year maybe, and we were he
re after she contacted the Red Cross in -- 
in 
Sweden. 
Q: Did you want to come to the 
United States
? 
A: Well, I had a big problem again, you k
now, I didn™t want to leave my sisters 
there, you know, because I already connect
ed with them. And 
I thought I™m going 
to spend my life with them, th
ey™re gir -- my family. So -- 
Q: Oh, these are the other su
rviv e -- when you say sister
s you mean there this -- 
A: The other survivors -- children. 
Q: -- the other survivors.  
A: Although I knew -- I reme mb ered her, th
at she™s my  real sister, you know, here 
in the 
United States
, 
Frances
 was my real sister.  But 
believe me, if I would be 
given a choice, I think at that time I would ha
ve rather just stay with my family, the 
m -- with my friends. Because, I says, wh
atever will happen to them, it™ll happen to 
me, because I no longer had a home and 
I didn't know what -- where I am, where 
I™m going to be. And it felt comfortable to 
be with these girls. But of course, you 
know, my  sister says, look, she is our sister and sh e wants us out there, and we 

have to go, and we went. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
24
Q: So how di -- what was 
it like to say goodbye to th
ese friends, these sister 
friends? 
A: It wasn™t easy. I tell you, it wasn™t 
easy. I tell you it wasn™t easy. We kept on 
promising each other we™ll -- let™s be in t
ouch, we want to kn
ow about each other. 
And I was in touch with many of them, a
nd then, you know, after years go by, you 
lose touch, and you see a di
fferent world. You see that th ey were your friends, and 
-- you know? And we came va -- when I cam
e out here I-I had a terrible -- both of 
us, I think we had little breakdowns. Becau
se you know, when I saw a man with a 
beard, I would say, is he -- you know, 
I s -- how come he wasn™t destro -- you 
know, it was -- e -- if I her -- if I heard a 
kid cry, I thought he™s being destroyed, 
not that he™s unhappy. I 
had a difficult time. I had su
ch a difficult time when I 
came out here, you can -- you can™t imagine. 
The -- what can I tell you? Wh at can I 
tell you? It was very difficult for both of us
, even though, you kno
w, to be with my 
sister, but was difficult. Then reality se
t in, you see? While you™re on the road , you 
sort of survive every day. Bu
t when you knew this was yo
ur last place that you™re 
going to, it™s -- reality set in and we realiz
ed we lost everybody and everything, I 
think this is when we s -- really started m
ourning, to tell you th e truth, when we got 
here. Yeah. 

Q: When  you were -- so you ca -- how did you co me to the 
United States
?  
A: We -- well, as I said, my si
ster sent us the papers, and -- 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
25
Q: Yeah -- no, did you come by boat? 
A: Yes. With th -- I think it was the 
United States
. I forgot the name of the boat -- 
with a boat. 
Q: And -- and when  -- when  was that? 
A: When was that?  

Q: Was it 1946? 

A: I don™t even remember, I co -- have to
 look it up. I don™t rememb er whether it 
was ™46 or not 
[indecipherable]
 in between. Do you want me to -- 
Q: No, that™s okay. And so you -- yo
u c-came by boat and you landed wh ere? 
A: In
 Brooklyn
. Na -- na -- in broo -- you know, I di -- we saw the Statue of 
Liberty. It wasn™t 
Brooklyn
, it™s -- it™s -- 
Q: 
Ellis Island
? 
A: 
Ellis Island. Ellis Island
, you know. 
Q: Had you seen pictures of 
the Statue of Liberty before? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: Did you know what it represented? 

A: Well, I was told on the boat, I 
was told. I was told on the boat. 
Q: Was the boat filled with survivors? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
26
A: I don™t know. I do -- I don™t think so . Because we came from 
Sweden
 and there 
weren™t that many survivors in 
Sweden. 
I don™t think so. No
, they weren 't all 
survivors. 
Q: And so th en you -- you got
 to -- you landed. What wa
s like to -- to put your foot 
down on American soil? 
A: A miracle, to ex -- describe it, really
. A miracle, because i-it took me, at that 
time -- when I got to the 
United States
 it looked like it™s th
e world. And when I 
was in
 Euro pe
, I -- I thought I™m in hell. That™s
 how I compared it. I don™t know 
how else to describe it. I don™t know. Bu
t I was just thinking, I don™t think hell 
could be that bad. 
Q: Oh. Hm. Who -- and your sister met you at the boat? 
A: Yes, she met us at the boat. She had 
two kids, beautiful, beautiful, two boys and 
-- but you know, she wasn™t a wealthy woman,
 so she took us in 
to her apartment, 
she had a one bedroom apartment, walking 
up three flights. Bu t she was so happy 
to have us there and we were
 so happy to be there togeth
er. I remember we slept in 
the living room on a bed that closed up
, you know, because she couldn™t keep  it 
open, then  the kids wouldn™t have where 
to play. But it was very nice. I mean, you 
know, she was just wonderful, she was just 
wonderful. And, you know, I wanted to 
go to  school but I saw that I had to 
go and provide for myself. You know, you 
couldn™t help seeing it. So, I went to school
 at night and I went to look -- actually, I 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
27
think wh at really saved me from not mo
urning th ere forever is because I knew I 
have to get out and get a j
ob. And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn™t 
trained for anything, and I -- I -- althou
gh I-I-I was learning ho
w to sp eak English 
for n -- for close to a year, but still -- I unde
rstood mo st of it but I couldn™t speak it 
too well. So there are so many drawbacks 
for me to get a job. Well, it took me 
about two, three weeks going every day. My
 brother-in-law, he 
wo uld take me and 
paid for my carfare, for my token because 
I had no money. And I was going around 
and he helped me, he came with me at time
s, and they  were telling me they would 
love to hire me, but I™m not trained for 
anything. And of course, you know, wh en I 
came from 
Sweden
 I didn™t have money to  buy clothes, so I was walking around 
with this big -- these big sw
eaters and these heavy pants.
 You know, I didn™t really 
look that presentable, either. So one day 
I -- there was a big place, a fur place, and 
my  brother-in-law took me up there to ask 
for a job and I went over to the boss and 
I asked for a job and he looked at me, and 
I told him my  problem and he was very 
sympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I 
would, but I don™t know where to put you 
because you do -- y-you don™
t know what to do. I mean 
you -- where -- wa -- how -
- I says, I™m going to do anything you want 
me to do, just -- just please give me a 
job. He lo oked around and sadly said, I™m
 sorry. So, I wanted to see how this 
factory looks like because I heard so much
 about it and how it works and all that. 
So from the office I sneaked in
to  the factory. I opened the 
door and I see that™s the 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
28
factory. So I walk in there just to see 
the factory and wh ile I was passing, I saw 
there an old man standing and he had a bear
d and he wasn™t work ing, he was just 
standing, looking around. And I said to my
s -- you know, in my -- my grandfather 
came in front of me, he had a black hat 
like my  grandfather ha-had, but he was a 
little shorter than my grandfather, my grandf
ather was very tall. So I walked over 
to him and I -- I felt that I 
can speak Yiddish to him and 
I did. And I told him my  
story. I-I says, you know, y -- I don™t know
 if you know the tragedy on what has 
happened to the Jews in 
Europe, 
but I survived with my sister and I came out here, 
and I have a sister, but I -- I can see she ca
nnot feed me or take care of me, I™m 
forced to get a job and I do
n™t know wh at to do. And th e man listened and listened 
and listened. And th en he says to me, wa
it a minute. So I said to myself, why not? 
I™ll wait. I have no place to go and no -- noth
ing to do. I™ll wait at -- and a -- I -- I -- 
I was watching wh ere he was going and I saw 
him go to the same 
man that just told 
me that he doesn ™t have a job for me and 
I thought I was going to  faint. And he was 
standing there and standing th ere with this
 man, and standing th ere and talking to 
him. And then he finally comes back and 
he says to me, come
 back tomorrow. I 
says, tomorrow? What time? He
 said nine o™clock. Wh en  I came back, I stayed 
near the door, eight o™clock I was alreadythere waiting the door -- for the door to 
be opened. And finally I went in there, 
into the office. Shall I continue? A -- so 
anyway, I went to the 
office, they took on
e look at me and as I said, I didn™t look 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
29
so presentable. It was a problem. And he 
must have promised his father, that was 
the son of this old man, he was the boss and 
I didn™t know at that time. So this man 
wouldn™t leave the son until he would prom
ise him he™ll give me some kind of a 
job. So  they  looked at me and they had -- 
it was a very big place and th ey had their 
own designers and were so many secretarie
s in this office. So the de -- I don™t 
know, I think sh e was one of the designers, 
or wh atever. She takes one look at me 
and she says to me, you never go shopping
. I s -- wi -- I said to her, you know, 
there is a problem, I don™t have no money.
 She takes another look at me, she says, 
well don™t worry about it, we™ll -- we™ll bill 
it to the -- to the 
company. So I had no 
choice, I go with her and th is lady, I te
ll you, she knew exactly wh at to do. She 
knew exactly what to do with
 me. She -- she took me in . I remember they were 
smaller stores. Now that I know there™s -- was 
Macy™s
 and ev erything, but she 
didn™t want to waste time. 
So she took me into these 
smaller stores and to ok out 
different dresses. And every time she brought 
a dress for me to put on -- first of all, 
I -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn™t 
have anything. Sh -- so she got me a 
little bra an d stockings, she put
 stockings on me, I never ha
d stockings in my life. 
And she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes 
with a little heel, I think it was an inch 
and a half, or -- and she tells me I should
 get dressed and then she brings these 
dresses. I says, you know, they ™re so e
xpensive, I -- you know, and I don™t have 
any money. She says, don™t wo rry about it, 
just put it on. So I put it on and I tell 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
30
you, I looked like a different person. Yo
u know, I just looked like a different 
person. Then  she went and took my  -- my
 hair was raw, you know. She took my  
hair and put it in a bun, and then she pu
t a little lipstick on me. And she bought a 
lot of clothes that I wasn™t paying mu ch
 attention because it was scaring me. And 
we went back and we got into  the office a
nd -- and I tell you, I 
did look different, I 
mu st say. And so the boss came in and he 
took a look in the office because he was 
in the main place, you know, watching th
e workers. And I saw him looked at -- 
looking at me twice, like to
 say well, is that the same 
girl? So, anyway, then they  
gave me a job. They  had a v -- like a 
[indecipherable]
 house, where very rich 
ladies came in to pick out 
skins for their coats. I didn™t realize how rich these 
women were at that time. And they were tr
aining me on what to say to them and 
how to deal with them and in
 no time I was so anxious to
 hold this job that -- and 
then I-I didn™t mind staying after the time, 
or I never went down for lunch. I would 
-- my  sister would give me a 
Jell-o 
sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and 
I was trying my  best they should keep me
 there. And after awhile -- after awhile 

they saw how -- I became a good thing fo
r them, too. You know, they paid me, 
they paid me well and I became a good thing for them t
oo, because whatever they 
needed, or -- they could do
 with  me. And then had mo
dels when -- whenever a 
buyer would come from a different city, 
they would call a -- a model, or a few 
models, matter of fact, and they came in
, it was a very big place. So one time I 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
31
became lucky and a model didn™t show up, 
and you know, that la
dy, she says, well, 
why don™t we call in 
Helen?
 So they called
 Helen
 in and I came th ere and they 
said to me, listen, put on this coat and 
take a walk. You know
, on a walk. I put on 
the coat and I took a walk, and you kn
ow, I was younger, taller, I tell you. A-
Anyway, I took a walk and this buyer said
 to me, take an other walk. I smiled at 
him and I took another walk. And it went 
well, you know, it went well. So finally 
that lady said to the boss, let™s send her to
 modeling school. So 
-- so they send me 
to modeling school for a few hours, but I s till had to come into work to get my 

paycheck. After a few weeks, what happened 
was they told me th
e same thing, yen 
-- you know, put your chest out, you know
, lift your head, walk graciously. You 
know, how many times do you need
 to be told what to do? 
So I walked over to her, 
I says, listen, I don™t mind going th ere, 
but it seems to me like I know everything 

already what to do. And I did it, you know, 
I sort of did it -- evidently a good job 

because then, when a buyer woul
d come in, they would ask, is
 Helen
 going to be 
there? Somebody tipped me off that a -- 
a buyer was asking about me, then I felt 
already secure with the job. Then I felt so
 happy. I was so ha
ppy, you have no idea. 
Anyway , I wound up with a beau
tiful job and people were very nice to me and they 
paid me a lot, I thought at that time, th
ey paid me a lot. I think I was getting 75 
dollar a -- a week. You see, and what happen
ed was, they paid th ese models by the 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
32
hour. And here I™m willing to anything they
 want me to do fo r 
75 dollars a week. 
But they paid me overtime if would 
come in on Satu

 I paid for my room

A: When I first came o v er, of course I fe
lt different. Of course I felt different, 
much different. When I started working and 
I saw how the people were really nice 
to me, I think it™s because th
ey realized where I came fr
om, what I went through. 
And I don™t know if I should tell that. 
I felt th  -- maybe because, you know, where 
I came from that rejection was difficult 
for me. There were two nephews, you 
know, young boys that worked in that place, the bo
sses, and they felt like they 
were big shots. And even though I had a 
beautiful job, you know, one was pretty 
nice to me, and the other one, for a reason 
or another, he was constantly bugging 
me. And I thought this is my  problem, but
 then I -- I -- you know
, my  sister says, 
what do you even  bother looking at him? 
I -- I says, well he™s the bosses nephew 
and he keep s on coming in  to the showro
om and constantly bugging me, you know, 
telling -- you know, he was -- he wasn™t a ni
ce person, I think. So  that was about 
that I felt at work. You kn ow, ev erybody else was nice, somehow, everybody else 

was very, very, very nice. 
Q: And how about yo
ur English, was that improving? 
A: It™s much better, because I was going to
 night school, and I started speaking. I 
had the background of 
English, but I didn™t ta -- speak 
it. So -- matter of fact, I still 
have the English dictionary brought from 
Sweden
. And -- so I got along well. I -- I 
-- I picked it up quickly. I -- I did better than
 my sister, because 
she didn™t have the

basic, you know, eng -- you know, she -- sh
e was never taught English in a school. 
In -- 
Q: Are you talking about 
Frances? 
A: No, no, no -- 

Q: 
Sylv ia
? 
A: My sister
, Sylvia
, yeah. 
Q: Oh right, because she was working in 
Sweden
 -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- whereas you were going to school, yeah. 

A: Right. 
Q: Then how long did you 
work at this furrier? 
A: Oh, I wo rked  there for over a year a
nd I don™t know if you want me to go into 
that story. I met -- shall I tell you what 
happened with me privately? I -- my  -- my  
th -- a-after a few month, after I got the jo
b -- after I got the job, you know, as -- so 
I -- I had pretty clothes because th-the -- th
e company gave me this clothes and I di 
-- matter of fact, they even gave me a fu
r coat. So -- so I -- my sister says, you 
know, why don™t you just go 
out of the house on a Satu rday night? You know, you 
sit in here and crying all 
the time, and just get out. So
 we -- my sister came with  
four friends and I was the fifth one. Nob
ody came from the scho
ol at the time I -- 
when I came. So we were like together fi
ve, and we kept together again because

we had th is background. So  finally on 
Satu rday night, we decided we™ll go to

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Helen Goldkind
. This is tape number two, side
 
A. 
And you had begun your st
ory about your life outside the furrier busin ess and -- 
and your friends. 
A: So anyway, one Satu
rday we did go to 
New York
 and we heard this mu sic there 
and we peek ed in to  see people were ha
ving a wonderful time, with dancing and all 
that, and we felt, let™s ju
st watch and see how people are living, you know? That 
was the first time we went out into th
is world where we saw people living 
normally, sort of. The youngs
ters, anyway. So we stood 
there for awhile. In the 
meanti -- but you had to take your coats 
off in order -- you know, and ch eck it in. 
So we took our coats off a
nd we checked in the coats 
and i -- you know, we were 
standing there and a few guys came and 
asked these other girls to dance. Bu t 
somehow nobody asked me to dance. So 
anyway, I stayed there and two young 
man walked over and they ta
lked to me and they saw I 
have an accent and th ey -- 
their par -- ha -- their parents were 
Hungarians, and they knew a few word s 
Hungarian, so they were -- 
sure enough they were ha
ving a good time. And me 
being so depressed, I was looking at them
, I says, why are they so happy? What is 
to -- so funny? You know, 
saying a word in  Hungarian,
 I looked at them like 
they™re a -- you know, I didn™t understa
nd them. I didn™t understand that they™re 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

37
just normal, happy young man. So they st
ood with me for awh
ile, but then they 
walked away again. And I was waiting ther
e for awhile, waiting 
for these girls to 
come back, so a man with a girl comes ove
r to me and he says, would you like to 
dance? I says to him, no, I don™t dance. So 
he detected a -- an accent and he looked 
at me again and he wondered wh y I been st
anding there alone and I™m not dancing, 
what are you doing here? So he says, look
, would you like to have a drink? I says, 
no, I don™t drink. I was -- I was thinking,
 you know, I™m waiting for the girls. I 
don™t want to -- you know, start in with anyt
hing. So th is girl that he came with had 
to say goodbye because she ha
d to go home. In the mean
time, this -- this young 
man is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to 
me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would 
you like to -- would you like a 
Coke
? I says n -- well, I do
n™t know if I can go and 
have a 
Co ke
 because I™m waiting for my friends
 and they™re supposed to come 
soon and we™re gonna go home. So I says -- 
so he says, well come, we™ll just get a 
Coke
 and we™ll come right back. So that™s 
what happened. In 
the meantime, I had 
to tell him who I was, that 
I™m a survivor and I just ca
me from where -- well, th en I 
became an object to him, that he wanted
 to know what happened because he -- I 
was the first survivor that he came -- he 
came in contact with. Well, I want to tell 
you something, he started asking me que
stions and ev ery question he gave me, it 
just -- I wanted to really hit him, beca
use -- and he didn™t realize what he was 
questioning. And then he -- he -- so I told 
him, you know, you™re talking to me like 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
38
it™s -- like you™re cross examining me. He sa
y s, I™m sorry, I™m sorry
. I just want to 
know wh at happened  th ere, do you underst
and? And I wasn™t ready to talk. And 
the more I resisted not talking, the more 
he wanted to know. So
 our meet -- first 
meeting didn™t go too well. He
 -- he -- and like, you know
, he -- he would ask me -
- he -- he really didn™t mean to hurt me or
 anything, but he didn
™t know how to deal 
with me. So he says to me, you know, I read
 in the papers that they were taking 
young women for the Germans. I says, y-yo
u heard right, but they were taking -- 
what happened was wh
enever they -- they took the Czech girls,  they picked them 
up from the street if th ey saw a Czech girl
, a Polish girl, they did use them for the -
- for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews 
were picked to be killed, not you know, 
taking them there. At -- so I 
-- I said to myself, a lot of
 Jewish girls probably would 
feel lucky if they -- you know, just to surv
ive -- to -- to -- to 
be able to do that. 
Anyway  -- but it was very, you know, it wasn™t
 -- it wasn™t good. 
So then he finally 
says to me, listen, I want to take youhome. I says no, you™re not taking me home, 
cause I™m going to go home with
 the five of these girls. 
So the girls finally came. I 
-- I think hey kept on staying there beca
use he wanted to pull out words from me, 
you see, because I wasn™t ready to talk. 
I couldn™t talk. And finally the girls came 

and you know, we are finish
ed having a good time and we
 says, let™s go home. So 
he says to the girls, listen, I want to take
 you all home. So the girls says yeah, take 
me home. We were five of them. So I wa
s between them, so -- he had a car. He had 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
39
a car. Matter of fact, he had a new car, a -- a 
Buick
. So he sa -- we -- he took us 
home and finally he dropped them all off a
nd my  sister and I were th e last one and 
he still wanted to talk and the guy says no,
 no, I have to go, you know, we™re late, 
my sister is going to worry, 
we™re supposed to be home. So I -- I -- he says to me, 
I™ll come and see you tomorrow. I says 
-- I heard him say it, but I didn™t even  
answer him, I just wanted to go in, b
ecause I was annoyed with him, the way he 
talked. So finally we went in and my si
ster says, you know, 
I worried -- and then 
my sister told us not 
to go into a car and we came in 
a car and we didn™t want to lie 
to her. So we -- we told her what happen
ed  and nec -- next da
y I was washing the 
kitchen floor and I forgot about him, beca
use I wasn™t too nice to him. A-And th e 
bell rings, and -- see, we didn™t have a tele
phone in the apartment, a telephone was 
downstairs and if there was a telep h on
e for us, you know, somebody picked it up 
and rang our bell. And my  sister was bus
y with  the kids and I was washing th e 
floors. But -- so my sister says,
 Helen, 
run down  and see who™s on the telephone. 
So I run down th ere barefooted, you know
, because I was washing th e kitchen on 
my  hands and knees. And I see this man st
anding th ere, I said to my self, what 

happened  here? Well, I did -- he did tell -- sa
y  that he™s gonna come back, but I just 
wasn™t paying any attention, my  mind was so
 preo ccupied with other things. So  he 
came back and he wants to go upstairs. I 
says look, I™m in the middle of washing 
the kitchen floor. I-It™s verybusy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don™t 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
40
think you can come upstairs. So he says, 
I™ll tell you what, I™ll wait in the hallway 
until you finish washing the floor. So he comes up and he stays in the hallway and 
my sister says, who is he? So I sa
ys, you know, this is the guy that 
[indecipherable]
 yesterday. I told  him that he can™t come because we™re busy here, 
but he said -- he chose to stay in the hallw
ay, so he™s in the ha
llway. So my sister 
was very nice, you know, she was norma
l, you know, she wasn™t like me, you 
know. So sh e walked  out and she says, w
ho are you, what are you?
 So he was very 
good friends with 
the family of the 
Bestform
. The -- their name was 
Benenfeld. 
You see, he la -- he 
lan
 to the yeshiva with the 
Benenfeld™s 
son-in-law. They had 
one daughter and that son-in
-law was a nephew of the 
geera rabba.
 So today 
geera rabba 
don™t me an anything, but in 
Euro pe
 it was a big situation. And my  
sister knew the 
Benenfelds, 
so she says -- so she felt a 
little embarrassed, she says, 
well as soon as she finishes washing th e k
itchen, come on in. Because the kitchen 
wasn™t that big, the apartment wasn™t that 
big. So he came in 
and he talked, and my  
sister talke d  to him, you know, my sister  ta
lked to him. At that 
time -- at that point 
he wasn™t no longer a stranger, but he -- sh
 -- he made connections with my sister, 
actually. And he stood there, he says he™s got to go to
 Richmond
, he was from 
Richmond.
 He told me the truth, he had a place in 
Richmond
, but then he -- he -- 
e-everything he said he told the truth, bu
t it didn't connect with me. So that night he 
left for
 Richmond
 and he said that he wants to come back, and -- 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
41
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Abe Goldkind
. And so wh en he went to  
Richmond,
 he telephoned me a few 
times and then he says he 
is sorry that he cannot see 
me this week because -- but 
did I get the flowers? I says yes, I got 
the flowers, but you know wh at? I don™t 
want you to send me any flowers. Becaus
e they were roses and you know, after 
three days in this apartment,
 the roses started dying. And 
don™t ask, I couldn™t deal 
with that. To me those roses represented 
life and all of a sudden I™m faced with 
death again. So anyway , he -- he just didn
™t understand what I was talking about, 
nobody did. And then he -- he
 did come to see me and -- but my sister wouldn™t let 
me go with him because, you know, I was 
so young and you see, even though I 
was 17 - 18 years old at that time, right, 
I was still like a child of 12. I had no 
experience with -- you know, interacting w
ith what -- so I didn
™t go out with him 
becau -- you know, he was just
 come to visit me in my
 sister™s house. And after 
awhile he got tired of it, he says, I want to take her to the 
Benenfelds. 
So my sister 
says, well, you™re telling 
me you™re going to the 
Benenfelds?
 So she says yes, so 
he got a cab and we went to the
 Benenfelds 
and I saw that, you know, he knows 
these 
Benenfelds
 and they were four brothers a
nd they  were, you know, very  close 
friends, from home yet. So yeah, came 
back, I says, here I was in the 
Benenfeld™s
 
house and -- and after awhile he wants to
 take me to the movies, you know, a few 
weeks later when he came from 
Richmond. 
So now my sister sa id no, sh -- you 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
42
can™t take her to the movies. So she says
, okay. So he says, fil -- y ou know me 
already, you know, you -- you must understand, I have a background. And I 
wouldn™t hurt her, she was hurt enough. At
 that point he alre
ady understood who I 
am, where I come from. So my  sister says, all right, well if you take her with a cab, 

I™ll let you go. And he 
had to park the car downstairs 
and take a cab, and we went 
to see 
Al Jolson
. And that™s how it started, you 
know. So actually, I think what the 
beginning was he -- he really wanted to k
now what happened th
ere. He was a very 
curious person, and -- 

Q: Was he your age? 

A: No, he was a little older. He was a little older. 
Q: And was he born in the 
United States
? 
A: No, he came from 
P o land, 
from 
Lódz, 
just before the war. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So had he lost relatives in the war? 
A: Yeah, he -- but he was lucky, he came 
here with his family, with his parents and 
sisters and brothers, yes. 
Q: But he lost extended family? 
A: All of them. All of them. All of them, yeah. 

Q: Do you think that
™s why he kept as
king you what -- 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
43
A: Yes -- 
Q: -- what happened , because he 
was thinking of his own family? 

A: -- yes, yes, yes, he really wanted to
 know. He really wa
nted to know what 
happened  th ere. I -- you know, there were lo
ts of articles, but they  were in the -- 
they were on the -- on the 
back pages. Nobody made a 
headline out of it. So -- you 
know, and people were skeptical. If so
mebody would come and tell you they™re 
taking hi -- little kids to the gas chambe
r, would you believe 
that? It has never 
happened before, so people,
 even  though th ey heard it, but they says, oh it™s 
something, you know, that
 doesn™t make sense. 

Q: When  you and 
Frances
 and 
Sy lv ia
 would be together in the apartment, would 
you talk about your parent
s and life before the war? 
A: Oh yeah, a lot, a lot. 
She wanted to know what happ
ened and we had to tell her 
what happened, we had to tell her the truth 
and -- and yeah, they were sad stories, it 
was a very sad time, y ou know. It was lik
e a mixed situation. It was -- it was a 
mixed situation, it was -- I felt lime -- lik
e again betwe -- I fe
lt like I™m again with 
people that 
Hitler
 didn™t destroy. I thought 
Hitler
 destroyed the wo rld, to tell you 
the truth. I really thought
 Hitler
 destroyed the wo rld. And wh en I came here, I 
found the world. And you know,
 I was -- but still, it™s very
 hard to explain, when 
you lose one person, yo-you know, like 
you lose your mo ther, you -- you -- you 
mo u r n  an d  my  mo th er, my  mo th er. Bu t wh en
 you lose 89 people at one time, it™s 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
44
just -- there is no 
comp acity 
in  you to  bear it. I want to tell you that. And but you -
- I think if w -- when I -- a-and of course
, I got married. I -- you know, of course, 
after awhile, after he wa
s co min g  to  see me  fro m 
Richmond
 and he already felt 
like he wo uld want -- you know, he got in
terested in me, actually, after he was 
finished with the stories of World War II, 
he moved his pla -- he had a -- a navy op 
-- army-navy store in 
Richmond
 and he said that I probab
ly wouldn™t want to live 
there, so he moved it to 
Baltimore, 
just to show me that he will do anything I want 
to, because I told him I™m not leaving my job, that he™s got to get a job in -- in -- in 
New York. 
And he says, you know, I-I-I™m not a ty
pe of person to work for other 
people, I need to work
 for myself. And back and forth.
 I didn™t want to give up my  
jo b ,  my  job mean t so  mu ch  
to me because I was so happy th ere. I was so happy 
there. But anyway, after awhile we came 
to an understanding, we will ga -- he 
wanted to  get married. Now, I -- you see, 
I -- I don™t think I was ready to  do that, 
you know. I -- I wanted to -- I don™t know
 what I wanted to 
do, I don™t know, I 
don™t know, I just wanted my  job and I wanted to work  and I wanted  to go to 

school, and -- but anyway, I agreed that 
-- you know, we all agreed because he™s 
really -- he really was a person with depth.
 He -- I just lo st him two years ago, in 
May. 

Q: When  did you get married? 

A: We got married Novemb er the ninth. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
45
Q: What year? 
A: Yeah, I -- I™m ashame of it, but I can 
look it up. It -- it doesn™t matter, does it? 

Q: So -- and wh at was your wedding like? 
A: Oh, you know, I -- even 
though I made up -- some money, but he wasn™t a rich 
man either. He came here in ™39, right be
fore the war. But he was very educated. 
So we had a small wedding th at we paid fo
r because there was nobody else to pay 
for. And then I moved to 
Baltimore. 
But -- 
Q: Was it hard to leave your two sisters? 
A: Very. Very hard. Th -- actu
ally then I -- you know, after 
I -- I realized I have to 
live in 
Baltimore, 
I -- I asked him that my sister please syl -- well, it™s another 
long story. My si -- I lost my sister
 Frances,
 yes. 
Q: Whe-When was that? 
A: When was that? Maybe -- mayb e three years after we came. 

Q: Oh. 
A: So th ere was another shock in  my  life th
at  one sister should
 have lived, my s -- 
yeah. Anyway, but after she died I says, le 
-- you know what, I can™t deal with this 
world any more. I need my sist
er near me. So he opened up a store for my  sister in 
Baltimore 
and she came to 
Baltimore. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
46
Q: What -- what did 
Frances
 die of? 
A: Kidney disease. Today sh
e probably  could have lived, 
they have dialysis and all 
this, so yeah. So then sh
e left these two little kids, 
so we took care of the -- 
Q: So you moved to
 Baltimore
 and your sister came  to 
Baltimore
 also -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- and then you -- 
and you had children? 

A: Yes, then I had three children. But I r
eally feel when my fi
rst child was born -- 
matter of fact it™s sort of -- to me this ki
d represented not only life, but sort of like 
my -- that -- that I -- I™m alive again. 
You know, I ti -- I don™t know how to explain 
it. So anyway -- and I looked at this kid 
and I said to her, I need to protect you 
from my past, because I was afra
id  that if I™ll be talking to
 her what I went through, 
it™s -- it™s g o ing to be a punishment to this
 kid. So I -- I promised myself I-I -- I no 
longer have the luxury on being preoccupi
ed with it. I need
 to put it away.  
Q: Ha-Had you been preoccupied 
with your past up to that point? 
A: Yes, I -- 
Q: And how -- how did th
at manifest itself? 

A: All the time sad. You know, my  husband
 really went throu
gh a tough time with 
me too, but he sort of understood it. I 
had nightmares. He was very understanding. 
I was married to a very good guy. And so 
I said to myself, I™m going to put all this 
in an iron box and I™m not going to  open 
it up. And I was raising her and I kept on 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
47
-- you know, she -- I gave her all my love, 
for the people that I no longer had. You 
know, there is a little bit t
oo much is no good either. Yo
u know what they say? I 
would never put her down. I 
carried her around constan
tly. I mean, I carried her 
around co nstantly, so what happened, being 
I didn™t put her -- I was afraid the floor 
is dirty, I was -- I was so afraid I™ll lose 
her. So -- and then she 
was born with big -- 
we had a problem, she was bor
n with big adenoids and sh
e couldn't take her bottle. 
So I ha -- we had a doctor come in ever
y day to the f -- when we fed her, they 
couldn™t -- like this she was healthy, but 
-- but she had this problem, she couldn™t 
take the bottle. So we had a docto r come in 
every day to  look at her and finally the 
doctor saw the kid can™t breathe when she cl
oses her mo uth. He 
took a look
 in the 
nose and her nose was clutter -- she ma
de history. They  took her to 
John Hopkins
 
and they  opened up her nose 
and that™s -- she could have died if this docto r 
wouldn™t of -- I would have lost her. And 
th e docto rs kept on saying that I was the 
crazy mother. But then they 
found that I wa -- you know,
 I had a reason, because I 
saw the kid is losing weight and can™t eat. So that was that, and -- 
Q: And her name? 

A: Is 
Rose. 
Right now her na -- her name is 
R o se Sha i nus
. And so I -- I raised this 
child and by ne -- never putting her on the 
floor she didn™t know
 how to crawl or 
she didn't  know how to walk. So  again with
 the doctors I keep 
on saying -- she was 
already -- she was already 20 months and this
 kid wouldn™t walk. So I take her to

the doctors and the doctors see a h ealthy 
child. They  didn™t know
 what to do with 
her. And -- so one day a doctor says to me, 
tell me, so how do you deal with her? 
So accidentally I said to him, you know, I 
-- I -- I love to hold her so much that I 
never -- I always hold her, I said to him, 
I always hold her. So he says, well, fa -- 
try putting her down  the floo
r. Ee -- I -- e -- I says, but she™s going to cry. So he 
says, well let her cry a little bit, and move
 away from her. So I did that. You know, 
she started crawling. Then she was looking,
 how can sh e get to me. So at 20 she 
started cra w ling. And then, you know, ev
en tually, wh en I knew what the problem 
was, I already, you know put her in a little
 w agon, and anyway, we dealt with the 
problem. It was my problem, that I created,
 but this is the kind of mother I was. I 
just never put her down . Even I -- I was,
 you know, cooking, or I was giving my 
husband to eat, she was always in my  ha
nds, she was like my  hand. I could never 
put her down. It sounds crazy today. I ne
ver put her down. Anyway , but she grew 
older and she™s -- she™ s fine, she - - 
Q: And then your other children? 
A: Then I had another daughter, her name was 
Michelle
 and I knew already mo re 
what to do. And then, four year
s later, we had a lit -- a so n, 
Larry.
 So that was a 
happy time of my  life and I had my  children,
 and of course I was forced to get rid 

of my  past that I -- I didn™t have that lu
xury to deal with it 
any more. Do you see 
what I™m saying? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

Q: What do you mean by th at? 
A: What I mean by that is 
that I wallowed in my  past and it made me a very hap -- 

unhappy person. And I felt I need to raise these kids 
[pho ne ring ing ]
 
[tape break]
 
Well anyway, I try very hard to live for th
e future and not for the past, and I was -- 
because of my kids. I wanted
 them to have a better lif
e than I had 
and I wanted 
them to grow up to be better people than
 I encountered in my 
young life. So this 
was my decision and this is wa -- what I 
was out to do. I felt that -- that that was 
my  job now and I raised them and I was 
very, very happy with
 them. They were 
wonderful kids. They tried so
 hard. I never talked about my past, but I think that 
they knew that it -- so mething 
in my life wasn™t ta
lked about. So -- 
so they really -- 
my  husband and my  children made my  life.
 And I went on raising them. My oldest 
daughter -- shall I tell you wh
ere they went to school or 
whatever? I should tell you 
-- okay. My  oldest daughter, she went to 
Brandeis
 
University,
 and my younger 
daughter went to ithic -- no, sh -- she went to -- not 
Ithaca, 
there was another 
college, I™m sorry. 

Q: In 
Ithaca? Corn ell? 
A: No. Anyway -- 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: Huh? 

Q: That™s okay.

A: A-And my  son went to 
University of Pennsylvania
. And my older daughter 
bec -- got a 
PhD
 in psychology and my  yo
unger daughter has got a 
PhD
 -- no, my 
older daughter has a 
PhD
 in microbiology and my  younger daughter has a 
PhD 
in 
psychology and my  son is a gastroenterologist. And they  have fami lies and I™m 
blessed with 10 grandchildren th at
 I l -- that I love them all.  
Q: When  you say when  you 
raised them you didn™t 
talk about their -- your 
background, did they ever ask you, 
and if so, how did you answer them? 
A: They started asking me after they went 
to college, wi -- believe it or not. They 

started reading books. As -- 

Q: They didn™t say anything 
during high school years? 
A: They va -- they would throw out, but 
I did not volunteer my  past with them. I 
didn't  
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So what did you say about their -- th
eir grandparents, or their aunt? How did 
you answ er them? 
A: That™s a good question. Well, I told thi 
-- told them that I lost them, but I did not 
go in to details on how -- what had happened
. But wh en  they started reading books, 
you know, I had to be honest
 with them, and I felt at 
that time that they were 
capable of dealing with this 
tragedy, where before I was a
fraid if I™ll tell them what 
has happened, they™ll be very an gry, a
nd -- angry people, I™ll bring up angry people 
because -- so -- and this is not what I want ed to do. So when 
they came to ar -- 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
51
when they read the books -- actually, what -- what
 -- what happened was, when  
books came out that this tragedy never ha
ppened, then  they started questioning. 
You know, they read the books -- I don™
t know the name of the professor from 
Princeton
, he was trying to  -- he was trying to  convince the world that that 
couldn't have happened. So  they came
 questioning me, how could it have 
happened , and actually that™s how I star
ted with -- you know, telling them how it 
happened  and how it -- you 
know, what happened.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Helen Goldkind
. This is tape number two, side
 
B
. You were talking about yo
ur relationship with your children and it was only 
when  they  were older that you started to
 tell them about what
 happened to their 
family and your family.  

A: Well, just to give you a example, 
when the mu seum opened, th e Holo caust 
Museum opened , I was a volunteer and sh
e says, Mommy, I want to go with you 
and I™ll visit the museum. So I went to my
 job and she went upstairs to, you know, 
look around. If -- at th at tim
e she already had three kids of her own, imagine. She 
went upstairs and about 15 - 20 minutes la
ter she came downstairs, pale. And so I 
said to her, what happened honey? Wha 
-- you know, you look so pale. She says, 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
52
Mommy , I think I saw you in th ese pictures
. And it wa -- she didn 't -- I -- I™m n o t 
in these pictures, but I said to myself, my
 God, if I would have fed her with al -- 
with this tragedy when sh
e was young, I know the ki
d probably would have not 
survived, if she couldn™t deal
 with it at that p o int.  
Q: What about with your grandchildren? 
A: Well, we didn™t talk -- we didn™t talk 
about it to my grandch
ildren either. That -- 
w-we made these decisions actually, becaus
e we did not want 
to bring up angry 
kids, or -- you know. Matter of fact, my
 daughter would say to me, Mommy , when  
I™ll grow up, I™m going to do something so  
I can help people. I says -- oh, you™ll be 
proud of me, I™ll ca -- I-I™ll help people. I 
says, sweetheart, I™m already proud of 
you, you™re wonderful. Anyway -- so 
anyway, she is the one who became a 
microbiologist so that she can help  people. 
So I™m just -- I -- I-I™m delighted that 
they grew up that they 
would rather help and not 
hurt. Because once you start 
hurting one group, you wind up
 hurting th e whole wo rld. 
Q: Do th ey know your whole story? 

A: Oh yes, now -- now they all know my  st
ory. I would ju st -- can I talk about my  
grandchildren a little b it, too? Because it means so much to me in my life, may b e 
more than anything else that I -- me -- as a survivor could raise three kids that -- I 
don™t know how to say it -- that are real 
human beings. I would 
be heartbroken if 
my  kids would have wo und up hating, b
ecause I saw what hate does. And -- and

they sort of go around with
 their normal life. I am 
forever thankful that the 
United 
States
 gave me this ch ance to -- for a new 
life, but my reward to them are my 
children and my  gran dchildren. You know
, I™m so glad I brought them to the 
United States
 and they are good citizens and th
at makes me very happy. And now 
you want to know ab out my  grandchild
ren. I have two grandchildren that 
graduated from 
Princeton
 and three grandchildren that graduated from 
Colu mbia 
University,
 and four little grandchildren that go 
to the Jewish Day School. So I™m 
very happy about it. 
Q: Do your child
ren live nearby? 
A: I have my  daughter and son -- one 
my  daughters and son living here in 
Washin gton
 and one of my daughters live in 
Tampa.
 
Q: When -- wh -- when your 
children were growing up a
nd they  -- let™s say your 
daughter
 Rose
 reached the age that you did when
 things got very difficult for you 
as a child, was that a more difficult time 
for you? Did it bring back memo ries of 
what you had gone through, when she wa
s, let™s say 12 - 13 - 14 - 15? When -- 
when life was so hard for 
you during th e war, and when  
she reached that age, did 
that trigger anything for you, wh en you 
would look at her and 
think what were you 
doing wh en you were her age? 
A: Mm, mm-hm, I understand wh at you™re saying, but my  answer on th at would be 

this, I was so afraid being that I wasn™t
 born here, and I have an accent that 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

54
somehow another my children m-might suffe
r from it, that I will not be able to 
guide them, you know, to the right pl
aces and do th e right things. So  I was 
concen trating mo re or less on 
what™s happening in  their life. I was always on top of 
it. I always wanted to know how they™re
 doing in school, and I always wanted 
them to -- to go to Girl 
Scouts. And I always wanted th em to do everything that 
other kids in the 
United States
 did. So this is where my energy went in, not saying 
-- well, I™m delighted  that my  daughter 
has it better. I mean, I was delighted that 
my  daughter has it better, but I felt that I -- I -- I shouldn™t touch th at part. That was 

a no-no fo r me to think back and say, wh
at did I do wh en I was 12, because it 
wouldn™t be good. I used to get these cryi
ng spells and I would ju st, for no reason, 
nobody would say much to me, I would cr
y and I couldn™t stop for nothing. And 
that bothers me even today. I would cr y and cry and I couldn™t explain it and I 

couldn™t stop. So th e ki -- poor kids, they
 were such good kids, they  would say did 
-- did we do something, Mommy, you™re 
crying, did we -- I said, no, you™re 
wonderful. I was trying to reassure them
 it™s -- has nothing to  do with them. But 
they were ju st sad to see me cry. And he
re if I would start talking, it would be a 
bigger problem. I could have contr -- you se
e, what happened was, I could control 
my  mouth, the talking, but you can™t 
contro l emotion, you can™t control the 
nightmares. You can™t control the -- I c
ouldn™t control the crying. I don™t know 
how to explain it, because yo
u know, I wanted to stop 
because I didn™t want my 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
55
kids to see me that way. I couldn™t cont rol it until I cried myself out, for days, you 
know, and th en all of a sudd
en it like, stopped. It reli
eved me. I think maybe cause 
I couldn™t talk, so this was my outburst. 
Q: You had said something befo re
 about your sister and you -- 
Sylvia
 and you 
didn't  -- co uldn™t really start mourning un
 -- for your family, your lo st family until 
you came to the 
United States
. 
A: That™s right. That™s right, because you see,  we were in so mu ch trouble that we 

didn™t think we™ll survive e
ither, til the last minute. My
 sister got typhus and you 
know how many people died in -- in
 Bergen-Belsen
 and -- and we didn't even 
think -- one of us wanted to surv ive to 
tell the world, but it wasn™t in our power 
really, completely to control it. 
Q: But even in 
Sweden
, you -- did you feel you 
could mourn your family? 
A: Not really. First of all, we were sepa
rated and then I had 
the resp onsibility of 
studying. And we were isolo -- we -- 
not isolated, you know, isolated -- 
Q: Separated? 

A: Separated, yeah. We were separated 
from society there. It
 was a little town, 
Fielgarden, 
I don™t know if it™s on the map, even. 
So  my  -- I think my  energy went 
in to bond with these girls, you know. A
nd of course we studied. We studied. No, it 

was no time to mourn. It was no time -- 

Q: Do you still get these nightmares? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
56
A: Occasionally, of course. Of course. If I 
see a document, or a 
-- it comes all back, 
yeah. It comes all back. 
Q: Are there any other sights or sounds or sm
ells that -- that trigger your memories, 
besides a documentary? Anythi
ng, any sounds, or s -- 
A: You know, you -- I don™t know how to sa
y this either, in or
der for people to 
understand it. When we got to 
Auschwitz
, there was such a smell of burning 
people that there was a smell. It w as a s 
-- definite smell. So
metimes when I walk 
into something, you kno w, like the light goes on, it™s the smell of 
Auschwitz
. It™s 
hard to ex plain what happens inside of 
me. You know, there is -- th ere are certain 
things that are in there -- in -- in -- i-
in -- you know, things trigger it off, for 
different reasons, for different -- if I see 
a chimney today, I have a reaction. A tall 
chimney. 
[phone ringing][tape break] 

Q: You were talking about wh
at sights or sounds or sm
ells trigger your memo ries 
of the war and when  you see a chimney that
 brings back  memo ries. Anything else? 
A: You know, it just depends, it just depe
nds. A swastika. You know, when  I see a 
swastika I feel I™m in danger. It s -- it s
ounds crazy to other people, because other 
people are not affected at all by a swastik
a. That swastika cannot hurt you. But 
what represents to me is something else
. Well, you know, a lot -- a lot of things, a 
lot of things. To say that I comp letely have
 a pain free life, I don™t. It feels that -- 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
57
you know, I have -- I have s-
so many nice things in my lif
e right now that I try to 
focus in on that.  
Q: If you have -- if you had had a different
 life, a different ch
ildhood, do you feel 
you™d be a different person today? 

A: Abso lutely. First of all I think I would be
 more of an educated person. I -- I hate 
to say it about my self, but 
Hitler
 took my  years of education away  from me and I 

miss that. I remember
 when I -- I used to
 feed my daughter with a bottle, I would 
tell her stories. Some mothers tell their 
children, you know, all kinds of wo nderful 
things and I would tell her sweetheart, wh
en you™ll get -- grow
 older, you™ll go to 
college. And looking back, sh
e didn™t know. She -- she would lo ok at -- I think I 
was telling myself that -- I was trying to  
comfort myself because that was robbed 
from me. A nd the simple reason that my 
children and my grandchildren are such 
overachievers, it might have something to  do
 with it, but I™m not sure, I™m not sure, 
I™m not sure.  
Q: You had said that you were a strong
 child before the 
war. Did that -- 
A: I think my  sister was stronger than I wa
s. My sister was mu ch stronger than  I 
was.  

Q: I™m talking physically and emotionally. 
A: I-I -- I think -- I think emotion -- I thi
nk physically I was strong. Emotionally, 

because -- emotionally I don™t think I was 
strong as my sister becau se I cracked 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
58
faster, I gave in faster. And a lot of people
 when they did that, 
they just took their 
lives. I remember in -- th
e first night in -- in 
Auschwitz
, when  I saw a lot of people 
hanging from these -- on these electric wire
s. I believe today that™s what, they  
cracked and they fel -- they 
-- they knew that 
the -- there™s no way they can escape. 
They just did away 
with themselves the best way th
ey knew how. And if not for 
my sister I ba -- wonder if I wouldn™t ha
ve been hanging on these wires, believe 
me. There are many time
s I think about it. 
Q: Where is your sister today? 
A: Yeah, I just spok e to her. She™s in 
Florida
 and she™s not well. Sh e™s not a well 
person and -- 
Q: D-D-Do you -- do you and 
sh e talk still ab out the war? 
A: She can deal with it less 
than I can, would you belie
ve it or not? We were in 
Yad Vashem  
and sh -- together, she couldn™t walk 
in there. I walked in there, and 
she couldn™t. I don™t know why.  

Q: Does she have children? 
A: Yes, she™s got two children and they™re 
both married and all have a nice family. 
Q: What are ye -- let™s talk a little bit ab
out your religious outlook, because of what 
you went through, had to -- did it make yo
u more religious, less religious? Your 
feelings about being Jewish, because 
you suffered because you were a Jew? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
59
A: Okay. I™m trying to figure 
out how to  explain it best. I would say th at I take my  
Judaism very serious because I paid a big 
price. And a sad thing happened  that I 
cannot be as religious as my  grandfather and my  father was. But wh at I did is put 
my  hope in 
Israel
, because I feel if we will not have 
Israel
, we Jews are not safe. 
So therefore, when something goes on in 
Israel
, it puts me though a lot of pain, the 
fear of losing 
Israel.
 I think I made my  peace with God. I have a lot of questions 
for him and maybe one day he™s going to 
be able to explain, or something -- 

somebody will be able to expl
ain fu -- why. The reason 
why the children come to 
my mind is because when I 
look at my little grandch
ildren and I say to myself, 
these -- kids like them went to the gas ch
amber and they  never had a chance. So I 
want to know why. I would very  mu ch 
like to know why. If there is a reason, I 
would like to know. I don™t know, I don™t kn
ow. This is how I live today. I don™t 
think it made me more religious, it didn™t.
 But I -- I respect everybody, whatever 
they believe in and whatever, because th
e truth is we really don -- you know, 
unless somebody™s a real believer, can he
 feel, you know, what you really read? 
But you know, in th e other hand, y-y-you 
know, God gave us a brain that™s -- y-
you know, you -- you also 
think and ex amine things. E-Everything we read, 
actually, you know, wa-wa-was -- it was written by humans and so  many years 
ago. So  I sometimes think, you know, I -- 
I -- I™m very happy th
at we have this 
things in -- in orbit. Maybe through that
 we will find out really, maybe something 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
60
more than w-we know now on earth. I™m 
hoping anyway, I™m really hoping fo r it, 
but it™s probably my great-g
randchildren will know a little 
bit more than I know of, 
as far as the religions are going.  
Q: Do you -- do you still practi
ce in any way, religiously? 
A: Yes, I belong to a synagogue. And 
I don™t know whether it is a habit, or 
whatever, I light candles on Friday s and wh
en ever I can I go to synagogue. And of 
course the holid ays, wh ich 
are the toughest for me because I remember what 
happened  at home. It was such a happy tim
e with my family. And -- and I™m afraid 
to complain, I™ll tell y ou the 
truth, because I feel like God gave me a lot back, and 
I™m always scared something sh ouldn™t ha
ppen to my  family, cause I don™t think 
that I could survive any mo re, you know? 
So -- so I don™t -- so mo st of the time I 
just say thank you God for wh
at you gave me and I hope they stay well and go on 
with their lives. 

Q: Are you angry that you had to go th r
ough what you did, wh ereas other people, 
let™s say in the 
United States
, didn™t have to? 
A: Well, I don™t think I™m angry because they didn™t have to. Matter of fact, I feel 

happy that they didn™t 
have to, because m -- why 
so much suffering? And 
unnecessary suffering. What we
 went thro ugh is not because I was a bad person. It 
isn™t because I committed a crime. So it do
esn™t make sen se for me to be angry. 
Matter of fact, I™m the other way. I™m happ
y that there were some people that did 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
61
not have to go th rough this. 
But I™ll tell you the truth, I live in fear. I™m hoping th at 
my  grandchildren, great-grandchildren shoul
dn™t have to go thro ugh wh at I have 
gone thro ugh. And therefore, when  I go 
to the museum, I want to teach society, 
please don™t hate. Please don™t hate. The ou
tcome of it is no good, no good. I think 
this is the message I 
would want to give th
e world. Don™t hate. 
Q: Would your ch ildren today be differe
nt if you had not 
gone thro ugh your 
wartime ex periences? 
A: I really can™t tell. I really can™t tell,
 to be very honest. I can™t tell. I think 
perhaps I -- I-I -- I don™t know. I think perh
aps -- you see, everything too much is 
no good. I think I was s -- too protective of 
them. I lived in fear
 they shouldn™t get 

sick. I didn™t have a normal day because I 
feared what will happe
n to them. But, in 
the end -- 
Q: Th-This is all three child
ren? In  other word s, it did 
not lessen as you had th -- 
more children? 
A: No, no, it didn™t. Each and ev ery one wa
s different and just to tell you I was so 
on top of my children, I remember my y
ounger daughter, I was watching over her 
and she fell and she hit her lip. And so I 
rushed her to the doc
tor and I kept on 
crying because it™s my  fault, I didn™t 
watching -- you know, another mo ther would 
say, well it happens. And th is was my  big 
fault, because my child fell and hit her 
lip and cr -- and -- and I couldn™t forgiv
e myself. So imagine 
my children what 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
62
they had to go th rough having me on top of
 them all the time. I think, you know, 
that was a -- not the best thing for them. 
You know, I -- I should
 have l -- I should 
have given them maybe mo re elbow space.
 See what I™m saying? I should have 
given them a little bit more elbow space. 
Q: Do you feel like you™re two different 
people? Someone on the inside -- the true 
person on the inside and so meone 
on the outside, facing the world? 
A: Yes. Yes. Because there is no way -- th
ere is no way -- I woul
d constantly want 
to live my inside. So what I do is try to 
focus in on what™s around me. And that™s 
how I™m surviving. Don™t forget, I have so
me responsibilities to my children, too. 
It™s not just me any more. So I think I am
. There™s a lot of sa
dness in me, although 
there is so much for me to
 be happy. I don™t have to -- I already mentioned that. 
But there™s a lot of sadness in me. And I re
ally think even the 
happy things, even  
the happy things are – the hap -- I think I 
get -- I get it from both sides, like, you 
know? There is this sa
dness in me and -- and there is -- 
there is the good things that 
I -- I -- I enjoy. That™s why my kids keep
s on saying, Ma, why you so  sad? Look at 
the beautiful things you have. I says, you
™re right, you™re right, I shouldn™t be sad. 
But you can™t say this to your soul, you kn
ow? You can say this -- I can say this to 
you, but I can™t say this to my soul. Yes, 
my  sou -- I would say my
 soul is sad. Sad. 
Q: Have you ever gotten couns
eling, or di -- have you ju st handled  this yourself?

A: When we were in 
New York,
 maybe just came over, my
 sister cou -- didn™t 
understand how to deal with 
us, so we had a little counseli
ng, yes, in the beginning. 
But then  we also didn™t have the money to  
pay for it. And at that time there wasn™t 
such th -- I mean, just -- we didn™t expe
ct any help or an ything. So there was no 
money and we just had to pull ourselves out
 and go on with our lives. And I really 
began feel that s -- right away, after 
a -- a few months, so many nice things 
happened to me. That -- that 
helped me. That helped me. 
Q: What are your thoughts about 
Germany
 today? 
Germ any
, and 
Germany
 
today.  

A: Okay , now let me tell you something, 
how I feel. You know, I always say, 
please God, don™t punish my  kids for my  si
ns. So I have to give them the same -- 
the same feeling. When I see a young Germ
an today, I™m willing to deal with him 
one on one, it depends what kind of person 
he is. But let me tell you something, 
when I see a person in my ag
e, I -- I doubt. I say, I 
wonder what you did. And I 
can™t help it. It™s not that I would want to
 do anything to him, but crosses my  mind, 
how could you have been su
ch a monster? Well, I don™t
 know how to call it. I 
don™t know. That™s what comes to -- cro
sses my  mind. And then , I™ll tell you th e 
truth, I am hoping ev en 
for the -- even for the Germ
an™s sake -- I mean, the 

Germans were destroyed too, 
Hitler
 took th em down the road also. So I™m hoping 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

they learned a lesson. I hope they learned a 
lesson, that we need a different society. 
That™s wh at I™m hoping for the Germans.  
Q: What about political situations here, 
for instance, the Civil Rights movement. 
Was that something you paid particular
 attention to, because in mentioning 
Hitler
, 
who took away other™s civil rights,
 were you mo re attuned to this? 
A: You know, you brought up 
such a good point, but ther
e wasn™t enough of us, I 
think, as survivors. We -- we felt the dept
h of this wrong thi
ng. We felt it. But I 
think a lot of people couldn™t 
feel it like we did, because they never experienced it. 
So all I remember, the riots and I remember
 all these things and I kept on saying, 
I™m -- I raised my children w
ith the idea this is wrong and, this is wrong. My 
children were brought up that this was -- 
this was a terrib le thing in our life.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Helen Go odkind
. This is tape number three, 
side
 A
, and we were talking about the Civil Rights movement. 
A: Me as a survivor, I wasn™t happy ab out 
it at all. I thought it was wrong, an d you 
know, I -- I raised my kids not to be bigo
ted and to understand th
at we are all made 
in the image of God. So i-it was a thing th
at bothered us in th
e family, a lot. And 
I™m happy to say that my  kids are -- are pe
ople that always, always stayed on the 
side of the oppre-oppressed people. I don™t know ho -- I -- I don™t know if I want to 
-- whate -- you know, whoever was oppre
ssed, they were there for them. 
Q: Can you give an example? 

A: Pardon me? 

Q: Can you give an example? 

A: Well, if there -- if there was a -- you 
know, a march or something, they  would 
go. I would beg them, please don™t get -- 
don -- don™t go as far as
 being lock ed up, 
but they  would, you know -- they  would al
ways talk about it in the schools and 
they -- they -- how shall I sa
y it? They -- they 
right away knew, 
even when they 
were little that this is -- this is so methi
ng that we shouldn™t -- we have to pri -- we 
have to right this wrong. And I told them
 if you™re not going to  right this wrong, 
it™s going to be awful. The wo
rld will come to an end. I 
saw it this way, because I 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
66
saw already the end in 
Europe
 and I was afraid there™s goi
ng to come an end here 
in the 
United States
. 
Q: Do -- do you think th ere could be so
mething like that in
 this country?  
A: Well, you know, you can™t have -- 
you can™t have people 
and oppress them. 
You™ve got to give them the freedom of, 
you know, what they are. If not there are 
revolutions and killing each 
other and one will figure 
out how to make a gas 
chamber, to gas the other. I-I-Is -- just doe
sn™t work like that . Or will become a 
jungle, the stronger animal 
will eat up the -- th-the weak
er one or whatever. I -- I 
just didn™t see it.  
Q: Do you think that
 could happen in this country still? 
A: Well, I have more hope now. I have mo
re hope because I think that people do 
have a chance. I -- I -- I™m not saying 
th at, you know, everybody should get a 
palace, but I think everybody sh ould have 
the opportunity to 
do with themselves 
what they  possibly can, and not
 being denied  of it. This 
is exactly -- I am the -- th e 
-- the pr -- I am the person that was denied
 of an education. 
Can you imagine how I 
feel when I see another child wo uld be deni
ed of an ed ucation? It would be awfu l, 
it™s awful.  
Q: What were your thoughts during th e 
Eichmann
 trial in
 Israel? 
A: Mm. 
Q: Did you follow it? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
67
A: Matter of fact, I was in 
Israel
 at that time and I went 
to one sessi on. You know, 
all these witnesses that were there, I-I 
-- I felt like I™m a p art of this witness 
anyway, I knew everything. It
™s just that I was trying to lo ok at him and trying to  
figure him out, how he was created. Was he really created by God, or were there 
mon -- are there monsters in heaven? B
ec-bec-because -- how -- how can anybody 
take again, kids, put them in wagons 
to a gas chamber? How could any human 
being do that? You know, be 
-- I always want to talk to
o, about the kids. You feel 
adults, you know, had maybe a chance to
 life, but kids never did. How -- how 
could this man -- I was looking at him 
and my  mind was just going a mile a 

minute, where he comes from, w hy is -- was 
he the way he was? Of course, I never 
figured it out, I don™t know. Have no an sw
er. But to my  mind he didn™t look -- you 
know, when I looked at him, 
in my heart, I said, it™s ma
ybe in my  eyes he looked 
like a human being, but to my  soul and my
 heart, I saw -- I saw a mo nster, a scary 
monster. It™s hard to explain because other people wouldn™t understand it, unless 
you go th rough this. I don™t 
know. I don™t know. So  that™s the way it is. You know, 
the few years that I™ve have left -- the fe
w years that I have left to live, I -- you 
know, I go and work  in the mu seum and I talk 
to children. I really think that if -- if 
-- if I could just help a little b
it, that much t -- 
help society to be a better society, I 
would like to do that, very mu
ch so. If not -- if a -- if I leave this earth and I didn't 
change anything in my small way, I thi
nk I™m going to die with a fear what will 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

happen to  my  great-grandchildren, because
 I already know wh at human beings are 
capable of. And if you let it go, it does no 
good. That™s really -- that™s how I live 
today. You know, I don™t kn
ow if I too -- I was talking to little kids and I was 
telling them about my little brother and I 
really, you know, I was making it mild. I 
just told them how we got separated and ho
w, you know, he brou -- he -- he -- he l 
-- you know, he had to give up his book, 
and how sad he was. And there was a lady 
and -- with two children a-and I really di
dn™t know who she was, because people 
were coming and going and then  after I had 
my say to the kids, this lady came up 
and she said to me, you know, I™m an 
SS
 man™s daughter, and well, he didn™t tell 

me that it was so bad. And imagine, I di
dn™t even scratch th
e surface when I was 
talking to these little k ids. She had two b
eautiful little girls with her and -- and she 
said that to me and it™s like she would h
it me over the head. And I said to her -- I 

didn™t have time to debate it with her how 
good or bad it was, 
so I pulled her aside 
and I say to her, listen, I™m so glad that
 you came in here, because I need to ask 
you some questions. Tell me , did your fa
ther tell you what his job was as an 
SS
 
man? We didn™t talk about 
it. So I says, you know, in 
Auschwit z
, w h ere I was, 
there came a million and a half children to 
Auschwitz
. And you know what the -- 
the 
SS 
people, they had their families there 
w ith their children,
 you know what 
their job was? Did you ever wo nder what
 their job was? She says no. Watching 
over the people she says to me. I says, not 
really. Their job was to take little kids 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

like yours -- I pointed  my  finger to her ch
ildren -- to the gas chamber. These kids 
had no -- nobody had any merc
y over them and th ey kne
w where these kids are 
going. And they were living there very happ
ily with their own fa
milies. So I -- I -- 
I don™t know how more to explain it to 
you, how good and bad it was. You know, 
she started crying. I think I scared her alittle bit because I showed my f -- pointed 
my fingers to her children. So I 
said to myself, you know, I -- I 
[in d ecipherable]
 
to -- as angry I was in the beginning fo r her 
to saying this to me, I -- I -- you know, 
I was really  upset. Well, I said, if she™s startin g to cry, maybe I touched a nerve in 

her. So I was going to hug her, and she st
epped back. She says to me, you know, I 
will never forget you. And I said to her, you
 know what? As long as you will never 
forget me, please rememb er what I want 
to tell you. If you see any children wh en 
their lives will be threatened
, speak up. Because your father didn™t. And that™s how 
she walked out. Now, re -- now I feel that
 I touched her, I touched one person. And 
that makes me feel good, that maybe if
 she™s going to  see 
a child in danger, 
whether it™s a Jew, or a non-Jew, or gr
een or yellow or purple, maybe she™ll be 
there and say wait a second, we cannot affo
rd  of doing th at, we shouldn™t do that. 
And you know, it makes me feel like maybe I touched someone. I would like to 
touch the whole wo rld and tell them don™t hate.  
Q: Let™s talk a little bit more about yo
ur experiences as a volunteer at the 
Holo caust Museum. When  did you begin wo rking th ere? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
70
A: All right, I beca -- I became -- I became 
a volunteer there right away, as soon as 
the mu seum has opened. And then  my
 husband retired and we mo ved to 
Florida
. 
And so I -- w-we moved and as I said befo
re, my  husband died -- it™ll be two years 
in May, and -- 
Q: So you started wo
rking in 1993, or -- 
A: Yeah, as soon a -- as soon as it opened. 

Q: -- th-the building -- 
A: Yeah, when it was -- 
Q: -- wa -- wa -- you did not work 
with them preceding the building? 

A: -- when it was finished 
I worked in there. And -- 
Q: Wha-Wh at ins -- why did 
you go to work for them? 
A: Why I went to work for them? Becaus
e I think th rough th is mu seum, hopefully 

people will get the message what not to do
 to each other. And it™s very important to 
me. You see, I cannot bring back  my  parent
s, my  family. There™s nothing I can do. 
But wh at I -- there is left for me to do
 is perhaps it shouldn™t happen  to other 
people and other children. And if I can 
do th at, I would -- you know, this is my  

main priority at this po
int in my life, anyway. 
Q: What kind of wo rk 
do you do at the mu seum? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
71
A: Now? I am at the donor desk , the memb
ership desk , I work. 
And then I also -- 
I™m on the speaking bureau. A
nd when ever th ey ne
ed me, if they call me, I make it 
a priority to go there. 
Q: An-A nd where have you given talks? 
A: Well, in high schools. And sometimes I 
talk to kids when 
they come in, they 
surround the desk there, and I 
will talk to them 
when they come in
, if the teachers 
request it. 
Q: And -- and you tell them your story? 
A: Not the complete story, 
because it™s impossible to tell 
the complete story. I just 
focus in perhaps on -- I give
 them a -- I -- I give them  a responsibility. I tell them 
that it™s in their hands to make a better so
ciety and what they saw there is reality. 
It™s not a motion picture, it was rea -- 
reality. And to go out
 and make a better 
world. That™s what 
I™m hoping they do. 
Q: Do you think wo rking at the 
mu seum has affected your life? 
A: I -- 
Q: Or -- or your memories of the Holo
caust? Has it affected those memories?  
A: I think working in the Ho
lo caust is giving me a chan ce to take my mother™s 
message to people, and so th
at makes me feel good. An
d I don™t know, I just -- I 
think I -- I enjoy wo rking there, don™t ask 
me why, but I -- I enjoy working there. I 
talk to people, different people, and I lik
e it. Some people have questions and I 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
72
don™t blame them. If I probably  wouldn™t liv
e through wh at I did, I probably  would 
have lots of questions. So I try to expl
ain it the best way I know how that makes 
sense. And as you know, the Germans were 
very, very  suf -- e-efficient, by keeping 
-- by keep ing track on where the Jews were
 going and what happened and all that. 
So if they doubting my wo
rds, they can always go
 and pick up with some 
documents that were -- that we have toda
y. We don™t have it all because it wasn™t 
just 
Auschwitz
 that th ey were killing people in the 
Einsatzg ruppen. 
And -- 
Q: Are there any other special insights th
at you bring to th e mu seum because you 
are a survivor? 
A: Special insights. Gee, I didn™t think abou
t it. The only th -- 
the -- well, the only 
thing that I feel I can explain th is horro
r mo re than anybody else, because we all 
read about it and we all heard about it and 
we all saw -- see the 
documentaries that 
they have today of it, but I lived it. And 
I think th e person th at
 lived it can really, 
really get it across somewhat a little better 
maybe than the educated and the teacher 
can. And I tell them my purpose on earth t
oday, and I hope they take me serious. 
You know, as I said before, I 
would just like to see a better society, and if I can do 
something about it I would like to
, the best way I know how. 
Q: So you feel society 
could be made better? 
A: I think so . I™ll tell y ou the truth, being 
that I was lucky enou
gh to bring in thr-
three kids i-into this wo rld and given the 
ch an ce to mo ld them, I think we can have 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
73
a better society, because I know exactly ho
w my kids feel. I rememb er going to 
work  in 
Germany
 an d kids would be -- you know, near their picket fences in the 
house. You know, kids 10 - 11
 years old, something like that, playing. And when  
they saw us pass by, they 
started spitting and screaming 
[speaks German here]
. 
You see now, when  kids are being brought 
up with this hate, I don™t really think 
they™re capable of loving other people, ev
en though at that time they were hating 
the Jews. But I think when yo
u bring up kids hating, th
ey eventually hate. Their 
life will be a hate. It™s very destructive, ve
ry destructive. Very 
destructive. So now 
I -- I really feel if my  kids would be di
fferent people, I -- I -- I would say well, you 
know, there™s nothing we can do. I unde
rstand -- I understand, being that my  
daughter is -- you know, she™s got a degree 
in microbiology that she -- she tells me 
a lot of people are, you know, born with
 certain genes, and I understand that. I 
understand that, but you still have to nurt
ure that gene. And he -- he might -- he 

might have the gene of havi
ng red hair or black hair or wh atever. But the nurturing 
to make a person, I think it -- it -- it™s a bi
g job. To tell you th e truth, I think if I 
would have known all that, maybe I would be
 afraid that I™m not capable of doing 
it, at that time, anyway. But -- so I -- I defi
nitely feel that if we can just somehow 
erase this h ate, we will definitely have a 
better society, I do believe in that. I do 
believe in that.  

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind

74
Q: When you meet other survivors, or fri
ends of yours who ar
e survivors, do you 
encourage them to work at 
the museum as a v o lunteer? 
A: I do. But it is hard to explain. As much 
as I talk about it, I still have difficulties. 
And a lot of survivors grew older and weak
er and they  just cannot deal with their 
past, it™s too painful. It™s very painful. 
So ev erybody does the 
best they know how, 
but I can also understand it. 
It™s a painful situation. 
Q: Do you belong to  -- outsi
de the mu seum, do you belong to any surv ivor groups? 
A: Yes, I do. I do, and we get together 
and we try to support each other. Don™t 
forget, we survivors -- I mean, thank Go
d that I -- you know, I have children and 
they made -- they made their own little fami
lies, one or two child
ren, but we have 
nobody else on the outside. So, believe it 
or not there™s some survivors that are 
dying, and if they -- you know, and if by
 some reason they could never have a 
child, or they had a child and unfortunately
 it™s not here, they really don™t have 
anybody. So we -- we become their family. 
Q: Wh-W hat is your relationship with the 
other volunteers at the museum who are 
survivors or witnesses to th
e Holocaust? Do you -- you -- 
A: Yes. How shall I say it? I have such 
strong, good feelings towards all the people 
that work in the Holo
caust, whether they get paid or 
not, because I feel n-not only 
are they do -- especially 
the volunteers, they are tr
ying to right the wrong by 
coming there and working there. I once 
asked a gentleman, why -- why are you 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
75
working here in this museum? I call it a 
cemetery. You could go out and get a job 
anyplace, at a happy place and have a happ
y day. But I have to understand that 
other people that didn™t go thro ugh wh at I di
d, they have a different feeling. But he 
-- he told me a story about his life. He 
says, you know, I have a child -- I have a 
child that I love dearly a
nd she is not as focused as 
another child is. And when  I 
think, would I have had this child in 
Germany
? I would have lost her. And she 
makes my  life. She me ans so mu ch in my
 life. Because, as you know, the Germans 
were gassing their own children first, the 
sick ones. Well, I don™t know wh ether 
this motivates him to be there, but I said to
 myself, if he told me this story, there 
mu st be a spark undern eath there. So ev
erybody that works in this museum is 
trying to  right the wrong, I think. That™s
 the way I look at them, an d I -- I love 
them all. I feel very comfortable with them
. I almost feel like they™re my relatives. 
I -- okay, no big deal. I™ll just tak e
 a towel and wipe it off, no big deal. 
[tape 
break] 
Q: We were talking about the -- your rela
tionship, and even with the non-Jewish 
volunteers and staff at the mu seum. 

A: Abso lutely. Abso lutely. Matter of fact
 -- I don™t know if I should say it, the 
Jews, I expect them to be there, y-
you know, but when  
I see a non-Jew as a 
volunteer, I really -- I really feel very good
 about it, very good about it. Yes, I do, 
and I feel close to them, yeah. 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
76
Q: Have you exch anged your 
story with other volunteers that -- survivor volunteers 
at the museum? 
A: Well, we all had different experience
s, I want you to know. We come from 
different places. The truth is that we™re -- 
[phone ringing][tape break]
 -- yeah -- 
yeah, I -- I -- I like them 
all. I like them all.  
Q: And then I said something about -- ta
lking about your experiences with the 
other surv ivors, but -- do you ex change your stories? 
A: S-Somewhat, but we really do not. What 
we do is talk about
 our grandchildren. 
Can -- I just feel bad that I forgot my 
daughter™s college. Can I just mention it -- 
Q: Course. 

A: -- it was -- she went to 
Syra cuse
. And 
Mishy
, please forgive me, but sometimes 
my  mind goes blank. And -- and I have
 another grandson that went to 
Ithaca. 
So 
Brian
, again, please forgive me, but I always think about you anyway . My mind 
sometimes goes blank. 

Q: You -- you did talk about some very
 memorable experiences you had in th e 
museum, such as talking to th
at woman whose father was an
 SS
 officer. You -- you 
had told us about this sp
ecial experience you had with
 this woman whose father 
had been an  
SS
 officer. Are there any other me
mo rable experiences that you™ve 
had at the mu seum when you 
were down there volunteering? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
77
A: Oh, I have a lot. You know, it will take fo
rever for me to talk about it. Well, th -
- that experience with this lady, it wasn™t
 in the Holocaust Museum, it was in the 
Children™s Museum on 
-- on -- you know, on 
Third Street
, I spoke there, too. In 
the Holocaust Museum, I -- 
at one time -- h e was from 
Germany
, you know, and 
he was very  upset, and he s -- comes over 
to me and he says to me, you have a 
nerve to -- to -- to have this Holocaust Museum here in the 
United States
. Why 
don™t you have a mu seum what you did to 
the Indians? I s -- and I saw he was very 
upset and I knew I can™t make a lot of no
ises there, because people will come over 
and will make a scene. I be
gged him to sit down. Actu
ally, you know, I was trying 
to be very  nice to him to calm him down. 
And he did -- he did sit, he sat down and 
he was shooting off at the nu -- 
United Sta tes
, I™ll tell y ou, it™s not enough that I 
was hurting from the Holocaust, bu
t then he started about the 
United States
, I™ll 
tell you -- I -- I mean -- but I knew  that I have
 to be patient with him, that I am in 
the mu seum and I cannot afford  on having 
a -- a scene there. So after he stopped 
talking, I said to him, you know, I le
t you talk now for about five, six minutes, 
right? And now, allow me to 
say something, and I™m not going to  talk for five, six 
minutes. I just want you to know that the 
United States
 talks about what happened 
to the Indians. In the 
United Sta tes
 we teach our ch ildren wh at happened  to the uni 
-- to the Indians. Tell me, do you teach 
your children what 
happened in the 
Holocaust, what your an
cestors did? So  don™t tell me 
-- and co me telling me what

the 
United States
 has the right to do and not the right
 to do. And as you see, we in 
the 
United States
 constantly are trying to right the wrong. Are you doing the same 
thing? Even today, you know, there is
 a lot of Arab -- you know, different 
countries people, there are -- still discri
minated. They still cannot tolerate them. 
We have a melting pot here. People from al
l over the world, they come here and 
they find a -- a secure place.
 At least their life are -- ar
en™t threatened. Does your 
country do the same thing? 
Well, then he left. Well,
 I -- you know, you get in 
different characters. I-I™m not blaming a
ll German society about it, but you get 
these people in. Some of them are very 
happy, some of them
 -- some of them -- 
well, I get so many, you know, I could 
talk for a di -- shall I tell you what 
happened once? That was in
 the museum. You know, we
 work right there as 
people come down from the mu seum, and 
she was a -- she was a mature lady and 
she came down and I see her cry, so I thought
 maybe she got sick, so I took a chair 
and gave it to her to sit do
wn and sh-she just you kn
ow, goes back  and fo rth. I 
says, lady, you know, 
I would very mu ch like to help 
you. And she looks at me  and 
she still wouldn™t talk to me
. And then she stays there an
d cries. I says, you know, I 
wish I could help you. So I 
pulled her over to the desk 
and I says, please sit down. 
Then, after awhile sort of, 
she loosened up and she says to me, she™s so upset. I 
says, tell me, why are you so upset? She 
says, well you know -- she mu st have 
been a religious lady. Sh e says, you know, 
Jesus
 was a Jew, and when he™ll find

out what happened to the Jews
, how will I explain it? I says -- at first I didn™t catch 
on, but then  I says to her, 
what do you mean? She says, 
well you know, wh en  I die, 
I™ll meet 
Jesus
 and he might ask me and I will not
 know how to explain. I says, 
look, lady --

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Helen Go ldkind,
 and this is tape number three, 
side 
B
, and you were talking about the woma
n who was so upset about after she 
died and she would have to tell 
Jesus
 what happened to  the Jews. 
A: So I said to her, you know, I-I™m Jewi
sh, I said to her. 
But in our religion 
everybody is responsible of their own actio
ns. So please, did you kill any of these 
Jews? She says no, I wouldn™t do that. I 
says, believe me, I know you wouldn™t do 
that. And -- so don™t just -- maybe you™
ll tell him you didn™t 
do that. And she still 
couldn™t swallow it, sh-she c
ouldn™t swallow it. But she was sitting there for awhile 

and we were exchanging what
 she believes in and wh at I believe in and somehow I 
made her feel that, you know wh at? There 
are some very -- you know, there are a 
lot of guilty people. I mean, I don™t want 
to say -- you know, I have to say first 
there™s a lot of guilty people, but also yo
u know, we™re all responsible. And I think 
that™s the way she felt. That™s
 exactly the way she felt, that we are all responsib le. I 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
80
think her religion made her feel like that
. And I thought that was a nice lady, and I 
don™t think I™ll ever forget her either. 
Q: You mean that we™re all responsible for 
each other? Ri -- is 
that what you mean, 
or responsible for the guilt? 

A: In a way we all responsib le because yo
u see, if there woul
d be enough people to 
say, we cannot gas a million and a half child
ren, then the world would hear it, but 
there was a silence. So they didn™t take th
e responsibility of -- of saying it. That sh 
-- he or she carries the responsib ility, she is saying, wait a minute, I don™t like that. 

If there would be mo re people crying an
d saying that, i-i -- you know, a tragedy 
like this wouldn™t have happened . So she 
sticks out in my  mind. I hugged  her and 
we parted as friends, sort of, and I was glad  that I got an opport
unity to talk to her, 
and it was a good ex perience for me too, yeah. 

Q: When you come into th
e mu seum, when  you walk in
to the building every time, 
do you have a special feeli
ng? Wh en you cross the thre
shold, wh en you walk  in? 
A: Your -- your -- you™re not going to belie
ve this. Wi -- you kn
ow, I walk in here, 
I walk in there and if I see people coming,
 it makes me  very happy. And if I see 
that people stop coming, I s-say to myse
lf, oh my  God, I hope these doors never 
close, because we need to learn, this pl
ace is so important. Yo
u know what, I think 
perhaps it™s even more important than I 
-- you know -- even 
though, you know, I -- 
I think universities are very  important, especially to
 me, because I™m not an 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
81
educated person, a-and -- but I think this 
museum is even mo re important because 
maybe we can educate people to be bette
r. And you know, there are -- the reason 
why I say this is this, because at this 
point today we know that the uneducated 
people were trying to save the Je
w, and th e educated people, like
 Mengele
 and 
thousands of others could commit this 
at-atrocity. You se 
-- you understand wh at 
I™m trying to say? So , you know, I think if
 a person isn™t educat
ed, but if h-he is 
brought up with the idea that
 we should be different a
nd we can be different, it™s 
very important. We think we™re very 
sophisticated and you know, as human 
beings, but we™re capable of doing a lot of
 unthinkable things, and that needs to 
change.  

Q: Are there any particular parts of the mu
seum and their exhibits that you id entify 
with? 
A: All of it, what shall I tell you? All of it.
 I went thro ugh all this, believe it or not. 
All this, it™s hard to believe. 
It™s h ard to believe, all this, wherever I go. I look at 
the little windows and I remember I -- you 
know, every little thing has got a story 
for me there. You know, 
as we were going to 
Auschwitz
 we didn™t know where we 
were going. So I was li -- you know, y -- a 
-- next to my  brother, I was, you know, 
the yo -- the younger. And they  pulled me up
 to look outside,
 I wanted to see 
what™s going on outside, and we were
 passing farms where people were work ing 
on th e farms. And th ey™re mo tioning with th
eir hands across their throat that we™re 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
82
going to  be, you know -- and wh en  I said it,
 I didn™t even think about it twice, 
because who would think, I™m a healthy person, that so
mebody is going to want to 
kill me. I just didn™t think abou
t it. To tell you the truth, I wasn™t affected by it. So, 
the window -- then I see these 
farmers, they™re motioning 
this to me -- everything, 
everything, everything. I take a look around
 and I see my  life. Everything, yes.  
Q: So you in tend to keep wo rkin g 
at the mu seum as long as you can? 
A: Definitely. Abso lutely. I think I want 
this to be, how shall I say it? My last 
breath. Maybe I™m too strong ab out it, but as long as I can do it, 
I™ll -- this is where 
I want to -- I think that™s where I belo ng. Sometimes I go with the subway and I 
say to -- you know, there™s a funny feeling 
[indeciphera ble]
 says, you know, I 
think I™m gonna -- I™m gonna visit my 
family, you know? I get such crazy 

thoughts. I don™t know why, but it™s silly. 

Q: You mean you -- you feel when you go 
in there you™re visiting your family, is 

that what you mean? 
A: S o metimes, so met imes,  so
metimes. I reach out to th
em, in my head, in my 
heart, I don™t know, it™s -- you know, I ha
te to say it because it doesn™t sound 
normal, but sometimes yes.  

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: Mm-hm, yeah.  

Q: Have you been  back  to 
Europe
 at all? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
83
A: My husband wanted to go to see 
Auschwitz
 and I really didn™t. I really didn™t, I 
was fighting it off and finally
 he says, you know, ra -- 
Helen
, I understand it™s 
difficult for you, but I have to go. 
[coughs]
 Excuse me. And so what -- he decided 
that he has to go, I says, well, I have 
to go with him. So we went once to 
Auschwitz
 with a group. And he -- he made a pr
ayer there, for all 
of them actually, 
for all of them. Anyway -- 
Q: Did -- did you go -- you went inside the camp ? You were able to do th at? 
A: Can you cut it, or not? 
Q: Yeah. 
[tape break] 
A: The most important thing in my life 
I already lost, so wh
atever, you know, I 
don™t take it to -- you know? So me people
 get upset, sometimes I look at them -- 
over really things they
 shouldn™t. So I -- 
Q: We were talking about that you 
went back  with your husband to 
Auschwitz
 and 
I asked if you went inside the cam
p wh en you went on your visit. 
A: You see, people that go to see this cam
p, really, they took 
apart the camp. They 
left there a few barracks. The gas cham
ber was there. For me, I saw the whole 
thing the way it was, but my  husband didn
™t really see it the way it was. So -- 
course everybody was sad and crying ther
e because we knew, we all knew the loss 
and what went on th ere. But it™s different. It
™s different than when
 I was there. It™s 
different. And I was so upset, let me tell 
you that. They have a -- like a mu seum, at 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
84
least when I was there, I do n™t know what™s going on 
there today. They have a 
museum there with pictures, and names. A
nd we had a guide, and I looked at these 
pictures, because you know, it doesn™t matte
r whether you™re Jewish or not Jewish, 
you look the same to me. People look the 
same. But then I noticed there was a lot -
- that there wasn™t any Jewish names th
at you would call. An
d I look around and I 
spend some time there, I couldn™t believe th
is. So I said to myse
lf, it™s -- maybe it™s 
me, because you know, it™s maybe -- but there weren™t any Jewish names under 
these pictures. So I go over to th e guide
, I says, listen, can you explain me 
something, because I don™t understand it. 
You know, I™m the one who was here in 
Auschwitz
 and I brought here my  whole fami ly
, 89 people, tell me h o w come that 
there isn™t a name that has a -- sort of
 a Jewish name. She says to me, well you 
know -- you know, you reme
mber when you came to 
Auschwitz
 you had to  take 
your valise and throw it in the ditch? I 
says yes, I remember, I -- I do remember. 

And so we don™t have
 any documents who came here as
 a Jew, but we do have the 
documents who came here that weren™t Je
ws. So I said to 
her, you know what? 
You told  me something new that I didn™t realize. I didn™t know th at there were 

some s -- b ecause this is a destruction ca
mp, and I didn 't  know that there were 
some non-Jews came here to be destroyed.
 I knew there were in different camps, 
some people that resi st ed 
Hitler
, but I didn™t think th ey came all the way to 
Auschwitz
. So you just told me somethi
ng new. So it™s okay, now I will 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
85
understand it. But 
[indecipherable]
. So she told me there are no Jewish names 
because there is no record of 
it, that Jews were sent to 
Auschwitz
. I says, you 
mean to say a million and a half children 
that you know went to the gas chamber 
here and there wasn™t one name of a child? 
I was so upset there, you have no idea. I 
was very, very upset. I don™
t know what they did with th
e rest of it there now. I 
don™t know what™s going on, but I better don™
t go there because today I can™t take 
the pain any more. I-I™m too 
old. So when you 
talk about this Holocaust Museum, 
we scraped here a few documents, there 
a few documents. I mean, th ey can say a 
hundred years from today it 
doesn™t even happen because we don™t have no 
documents of any kind. So I th
ink that™s important there.  
Q: Well, the -- 

A: That™s my experience with 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Did you go back to where 
you lived? Did you go back? 
A: No, they didn™t le-let us go th
ere because the Russians were there. 
Q: Oh. 

A: So we -- I couldn™t go there and I really
 didn™t want to go there to face these 
people, I don™t think I could. 
Q: Why not? 
A: Because it would be very difficult for me
. It would be very difficult for me. Not 
that it wasn™t difficult to go to 
Auschwitz
, but it would be mo re -- it would be just 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
86
as difficult over there. Don™t forget, thes
e people lived there for generations and 
generations and generations an
d generations. In the wit -- with -- way they made us 
-- way they made us look, like we were le
ss than rats to thes
e people. So how can 
they look at me and have any respect 
for me? And why sh ould I go th ere? The 
world is plenty big and it will take ge
nerations and generations to come for 
Europe
 
to recuperate to see a Jew as any other 
normal person, I want to tell you th at. The 
damage that was done there, that™s the way I feel. 
Q: Do you get reparations? 
A: Yes, I do. 

Q: What is your feeling about that? 
A: Oh well, I™ll have to tell you the story ab
out it. In the beginning I didn™t want to 
hear about it. Oh, when I heard it, I -- I c --
 I cried, I carried on, and I says, there is 
no money to pay me what they took away
 from me, it™s ridiculous, I says, I -- I 
don™t want it and I was fighting it. It t
ook me maybe two years with my  husband 

back and forth. You see, he -- I was emoti
onal about it and he was realistic about it. 
He couldn™t reach me and I couldn™t reac
h him. So finally, what did the sale from 
him, where he, you know, sort of hit th
e nail o-o-on th e head, is telling me, you 
know, 
Helen
, I know you don™t want this mone
y, but what you sh ould do is take 
this money and help other 
people that are suffering. 
And I said to myself, now 
maybe -- maybe I™m just -- maybe reality, that
™s what the -- realis
tically that™s what 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
87
I should do. But for a long time I was very 
emotional about it, that I couldn™t even 
think realistically. So -- but that™s what I di
d, that™s exactly what I do. I never use a 
penny of it, never, because I would feel like I want to, you know. So then I says, 
you know, I did send this check there 
and there and I™m hoping that m- made 
somebody feel better. I do that. I do that.  
Q: What was it like for you to 
become an American citizen? 
A: Well -- 
Q: And what does it mean to you today? 
A: I need to get on my va -- vocabulary is
n™t too big, and I need -- sometimes when  

I™m looking for a certain word  I have to th
ink about it, and I still don™t get it. I was 
delighted  to beco me an Amer
ican citizen. I -- I -- I bless 
America
 as much as -- 
you know, to me, being a -- I™m not saying
 it™s perfect, but for a person like me, I 
see the 
United States
 a little bit different than othe
r people do, different. Because 
the other people feel that this is the way 
life is, and that™s the way, you know -- I 
love the 
United States
 and I am delighted th at I, you know, i-if I want to make 
myself feel good, as I said 
before, I -- I says, I gave the 
United Sta tes 
three kids 
that are the best of citizens a
nd a -- I -- I-I really love the 
United States.
 And you 
know what? If I hear someb ody complaining, which there™s plenty complaints, I 

very patiently listen, you know, I listen, a
nd -- but I always want to debate it. I 

don™t let it just go. I feel th -- I showed 
the other side of the coin an d I have so 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
88
mu ch material to show on the other side of 
the coin, but I never let it go. Just like I 
would sp eak up for this child that is 
in danger, that™s how I feel about the 
United 
States
. I need to speak up, and I do. I do.  
Q: Well, speaking of these three wond
erful citizens that you gave to the 
United 
States, 
is there any message that you wanted
 to leave for your children or your 
grandchildren? 
A: I wish I could find so me word s of wisdom. I used to tell my  husband to  do that. 
Well first, I™m just lucky to  have -- to ha
 -- you know, I know life comes to an end, 
I™m just lucky th at I had the opportunity of
 experiencing even to
 have my children. 
And not only are -- are they wonderful children to me, but they™re just -- they™re 

just very good citizens. I feel if my  ch
ildren are around someplace or somewheres 
where somebody will be 
[indecipherable]
 I have a feeling that they will want to be 
there the first ones. My grandchildren are 
like I can™t believe it. They™re such a big 
part of my good feeling in. 
They™re such nice kids, all of them, all of them, all of 
them. And well, in the end, I -- you know, 
I just want to say that God took aw ay a 
lot from me, but he also gave me back a 
lot. And my hope and pray is that they 
take good care of themselves and they c
ontinue in this world, being a model for 
society. 

A: Are your children named af
ter anybody inparticular? 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
89
Q: My daughter, when she was born ther
e were so many names. In the meantime I 
didn™t have a mo ther and 
Abe 
didn™t have a mother. So, 
how do -- what do we do 
with all these names? I wanted to name he
r a dozen names. So I se -- I said to 
Abe
, 
well, you know wh at? Today we™ll ma --
 you know, Monday we™ll call her this, 
Tuesday we™ll call her that. It was such
 a crazy thought to me, honestly, I 
reme mb er. So he was laughing, he says, 
you know you™re not being realistic. We 
need a name. So finally he said we™ll -- half
 of my  mo ther™s name and a half of my  
husband™s name. So that was the compro
mise. My second daughter came  and 
Abe
 
had his father. So here I -- I wanted to na
me her after my father, because I didn 't 
think I™m gonna have mo re children. We 
just thought of having tw o children. So  
that was big problem. Here this beautiful 
little kid is born and we want to name her 
after my father. And so my husband went a
ll over the city to lo
ok for a name that 
you can translate from a man™s name to a Je
wish name. He went to the synagogues, 
to the library, he brought me
 all kinds of books to the hospital. And finally we 
found the name, and so she is named 
after my father, and we named her 
Michelle
. 
This is my  second. But I™ll tell you, it wa
s such an anxiety every time we would 
have to pick a name, because we needed  
to give these kid -- kids 16 names, like 
never befo re, you know? So it was a big th
ing to us, my  husband spent a few days 
on figuring out how should we 
name this beautiful child. 
So it -- and then my son. 
So then  my son came and, you know, so 
already my  father had a name and of 

 
Interview with Helen Goldkind  
 
February 21, 2001 
 

 
 
90
course my oldest brother also got killed by
 picking mines. So I wanted that name 
badly and my  husband was trying to acc
ommodate me because e-even though he 
had a big loss, too, you know, all of his relatives were in 
Euro pe.
 But he knew that 
meant a lot to me, so he says okay, we goi
ng to name this child after your family, 
he ga -- so he says -- so I says, you kno
w, I want to name him after my  oldest 
brother, something. He says
, but you know, in the Jewi
sh faith, you cannot name a 
child after a young person. So  he says, I™ll 
tell you wh at, let™s name  him after your 
brother and after my  grandfather, so 
[indecipherable]
 his name is 
L a rry
. So -- but 
it was a bi -- you know, you brought up a 
very  good point, that was a big thing in 
our lives, how we planne
d on th ese kids, so -- 
Q: And what are your grandchildren™s na
mes? You can just go down  the line. 
A: Okay, now -- who their name 
is -- who their name aft -- 
Q: Well, if you 
[indecipherable]
 fine. 
A: Okay, the first grandchildren that we
re born, they were all named after my 
husband™s father, because that -- you know, he
 died. So this is her -- was his wish. 
And of co urse, as good as these kids were, 
they wanted  to please him, and that™s 
what it was. And with 
Evan, 
my  son-in -law™s grandma died when  he was born, so 
Michelle
 said that would be nice to do, becaus
e -- but of course, he was a boy, they 
called him 
Evan. 
And then 
Bria n, Brian 
my -- 
Q: Numb er two grandchild?

A: -- number thr -- num 
[phone ringing][tape break] 
Q: We were talking about the names of yo
ur grandchildren, so can you go down 
the line and name them? 
A: Okay . My oldest 
daughter™s children are 
Jason, Ed ina
 and  
Fefy.
 My younger 
daughter™s children™sname are 
Darren, Evan
 and 
Brian.
 My son™s children are 
Josh, Clifford, Jessica
 and 
Matthew.
 And they are the greatest, all of them. All -- 
all are the greatest kids. I™m 
just lucky having them, the tr
uth, that™s the truth.  
Q: Is there anything that you would liketo say that we haven™t covered today? 
A: I-I™m glad that I had an 
opportunity to be recorded
 and heard. And I -- I hope 
whoever™s gonna listen to my tape that
 will learn something. And again, I 
mentioned it so many times that
 I wil -- that they -- they
™ll try and make the wo rld 
a little better, and I don™t know, that 
-- that™s what I 
would like to do. 
Q: Well, that™s a wonderful note to end 
on. Thank you very 
much for doing the 
interview. This concludes the
