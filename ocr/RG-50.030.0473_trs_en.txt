Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Julian. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: Nice to have you in Washington. 

A: Nice to be here. 

Q: Tell me  when you were born.  

A: I was born on March 26, 1925. 

Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: I was born in Lwów, Poland, now it™s called Lviv, U-Ukraine. 

Q: And wha t  was your name  at birth? 

A: My name  at birth was Julian and actually my
 mi ddle na me Jacob, and my father and mother 
decided to call me  Julian because they wanted an
 international name  and 
they thought Julian, if I 
ever went -- were to tr
avel, would work well. 
Q: And your last name  was Bussgang? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And the same spelling. It™s re
ally important to get a sense of
 what your family was like, so 
let™s talk about your mo ther and father and sister
, and your memories of that early time in Lwów. 
A: My father was a very serious ma n. He was 
born in Rohatyn, which is town south of Lwów, 
and he started his schooling in [indecipherable] but
 decided to leave it and 
went to regular public

school. And then he went to an educational semi nary to become  a teacher and then he became  
inspector of schools, and then he went into 
business and move d to Lw
ów. And my mother™s-- 
her ma iden name  w-was Philip, and she was from Lwów, and her mother was from Kraków. And 

my parents ma rried, my  father was 
already a little older, I think, 
and he was like nine years older 
than my mot her, and -- and they had two children,
 my sister Janina, or 
Janine as you would say 
in English, and myself. My sister wa s born in
 1923, I was born in 1925. There was only like a 

year and a half difference between us, so we were
 very close. And we we re a very close fa mily. 
My father worked in an office downstairs in 
the same  house where we lived, and actually my 
mother worked with him, and we had help, dome stic help in the apartment. And we were a close 

fa mily mostly, with my mother™s si st ers, my a
unts and uncles. And I had a very warm and nice 
childhood. I grew up very secure. 

Q: Tell me  what did your father 
do? What sort of business was it? 
A: He was representing a number of large compa nie
s in the region like Le ver Brothers and some  
companies from Holland. And it was mostly products
 that didn™t require 
refr igeration, was like 
starch and -- and soap powders, things like this. 
And so a -- and he was in business of selling to 
retailers, so that actually he was quite -- we we
ren™t overly rich, but we 
were very well-to- so. 
Q: So when -- when you were born, he was already fairly successful? 

A: He was fairly successful, yes. 

Q: Right. So you -- you grew up in a fair
ly privileged environment, I guess. 
A: Right, right, and my mother™s family, one of
 my uncles was a very prominent physician and 
another uncle was a banker and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473

A: -- and had his own bank. And he was the one 
who arranged the ma rriage betwe -- my father 
had been his client -- betw
een my mother my father. 
Q: I see. 
A: He got them acquainted.  

Q: Tell me  about the per -- your relationship to yo
ur father and your relationship to your mother. 
Were you closer to one than to the other? 

A: I ma y ha ve been a little bit closer to my moth
er, and my father ma y have
 been a little closer to 
my sister. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But actually we were all pr etty closebecause we were all in the same  house. 

Q: House, right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you ever work with your father?  Did you ever -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- go into the [indecipherable]?  No, you didn™t. 

A: Never. I was a very good student
 as a child, and -- and because my
 sister was a year and a half 
older than myself, I f-followed her very clos
ely and I went to school early, because once she 
went to school, I wanted to go to school. 

Q: Right. 

A: So I was always the youngest in my class. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I also had private tutoring in German and private tutoring in mathematics because I was 

particular ly interested in mathematics. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
4 
 
Q: Mathematics. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: We re you also close with your sister? 

A: I was very close with my sister. We
 actually shared a r
oom for a long time. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And was she good to you as an older sister? 

A: Ah, sh -- well, we were a little jealous of 
each other some time s, but she was good to me , yes. 
Q: And wha t  were you jealous about? 

A: Because she was a year older, so she was doing
 things a little bit ahead of me , but -- but we 
became even closer when we became refugees. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because then the fami ly got really close.  
Q: Did you ever do things alone with your father 
or alone with your mother, going for walks, or 
going to -- I don™t know if there were cultura
l things in the city, or to a museum?   
A: Mostly I was doing things with
 my sister with the people who 
were taking care of us. But we 
s -- seldom -- my father was very seri
ous, he was seldom playful with us. 
Q: He was seldom playful? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. And your mother was more so? 

A: My mother a little more so, but she also wa
s very busy working and looking after things in the 
house, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. So did you -- did you have a lot 
of help in the house?  Did you ha -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
5 
 
A: We had somebody who cooke
d, and some body who cleaned. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then as babies we  had -- once we had a fräulein, a Ge rman lady, and once we had a 

ma de moiselle, a French ma de moiselle, 
so -- who took us for walks, yeah. 
Q: So did you learn both la
nguages? How ma ny l a nguages? 
A: I -- I learned Fr-French and German. Of cour
se, we spoke Polish at home , and -- and then 
during the war I learned a 
little Hebrew and Italian because I was in Italy. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: So when I me t my wi fe I told her I knew five languages, and she was impressed. 

Q: And did she test you on that?  No.  

A: Tested my French and she™s pretty good at French herself. 

Q: Were you in an environment where Polish Je
ws and Polish Christians were mi xing, that you 
yourself were within a very inte
grated kind of setting, or not? 
A: Yes. Socially, a- and family-wise, the family 
was Jewish and most of 
our close friends were 
Jewish, but -- but we were an assimi lated familyand we were in quite an integrated environment 

and I went to a school where ma jority of the kids
 were not Jewish and -- both in the elementary 
school and in the high school. I 
went to public high school. 
Q: Okay. 

A: I went to a private elementary school becau
se I was too young to go to the public high school, 
and the private sc
hool took me  in. 
Q: And was this a comfortable 
environment?  When you say that 
you were assimilated as Jews, 
did this also mean that you celebrated Jewish 
holidays and we nt to the synagogue, or you didn™t? 
A: Oh yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
6 
 
Q: You did? 
A: We defi nitely -- my parents belonged to what was called the temple, which is the -- was the 

largest synagogue in the city, and it was called 
Progressive Judaism, whi c h is similar to 
American Conservative Judaism. And -- and my 
father had a seat, you had to buy seats and my 
father had a seat downstairs and my moth
er had a seat on the balcony, in the -- 
Q: Where the women sat. 

A: Yeah. And I sat with my dad, yeah. 

Q: And your sister sat upstairs, or with you? 

A: Yes, upstairs, yes, yes. 

Q: Upstairs. So did you go during the holid
ays, or did you go every Shabbat, or -- 

A: No, no, we went just during holidays. 

Q: Holidays. 

A: Yeah, right. My parent
s were not very religious. 
Q: Right. 

A: But they defi nitely were Je
wish, but not extremely religious. 
Q: Not -- right. So I could -- should I assu
me  that you were not kosher in the house? 
A: We  were not kosher. 

Q: Yes. Or anywhere, actually. 

A: No. 

Q: Yes. 

A: No.  

Q: And how was it for you to be in a -- 

A: We  ate matzoh on Passover -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
7 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- but some ti me s I had ham on t he ma tzoh. 

Q: On the -- [laughs]. Did you experien
ce anti-Semitism as you were growing up? 
A: As I was growing up there was anti-Semitism growing in Poland, beginning around 1934, and 

it was particularly evident at universities, and -- 
because Je wish student s were not -- were told to 
sit in back benches and were not allowed 
sometimes to -- to even attemp t classes 
[indecipherable]. And -- and some  of the -- inte
restingly enough, the unive
rsity students were 
what was called open index. N -- N.D. stands for 
National Democracy which is -- was the sort  of 
right wing pa rty, which was very anti-Semitic, 
and they sometimes would make -- not pogroms 
in the sense that some body was completely bludge
oned to death, but they 
would beat up J-Jews 
in the st reet occasionally. And I learned to a
void big gangs of students, and -- and sometimes 
there were just stupid people who were anti-Semitic
, but most of the people in the city were very 
well integrated because the -- the city itself had 
been under Austrian occupation and ha d a lot of 
Jew -- 30 percent of the residents were Jews, and 
-- and in addition Polish Catholics, there were 
Greek Orthodox, and there were Ukrainians a
nd there were Ar me nians, so it was kind of 
cosmopolitan [i ndecipherable] 

Q: Right. And your close friends?  You ha
d Jewish friends, and Polish friends? 
A: I had Jewi sh friends and Polish friends, but in
 terms of going to homes  of kids, I was closest 
to the Jewish boys. 

Q: And did you notice that that wa
s because there was a kind of 
division, or you think it was just 
happenstance? 

A: Mostly because sometimes -- it was partly beca
use there wa s a little division, yeah. But I was 
very friendly with ma ny of non-Jewish -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
8 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- people. 

Q: Let -- let me go back a little bi
t. Were you interested in ma the m
atics as a very tiny kid?  And -
- 

A: I was very interested in mathematics, yes. 

Q: Wa  -- were -- was this comi ng from your parents,
 I mean is there some  way to trace it, or it 
just -- do you know? 

A: No, it™s just a natural interest. So
me kids are interested in music. 
Q: Right. 

A: I was never very musical. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I liked just playing ch
ess and doing mathematics. 
Q: I see. We re there any other subject ma tters that
 were of interest to you,
 or was this your real 
passion [indecipherable] 

A: This -- 

Q: Mm?  

A: -- this was the real passion. I was 
some what interested in history. 
Q: Did you go to the movies as a kid?  This 
is before the war, I mean [inde cipherable]

I went to perfor mances, both opera and theater.

A: The opera house in Lwów is beautiful. 
Q: And do you [indecipherable] 

A: It has survived, and is -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- and it™s been re-remodeled an
d is just like it used to be. 
Q: A-And do you reme mber any particular opera? 

A: Not really. 

Q: No. 

A: Got more interested in opera in that way then. 

Q: Uh-huh. And theater?  Do you reme mb
er any theater that you went to? 

A: I reme mb er going to theater, 
but -- but I don™t reme mber -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- s-specific performa nces. 
Q: And whe n you went to the movies, did you go 
with your sister, or you went with a bunch of 
kids?  Do you have any recollection, or you don™t -- 
A: I don™t recollect. 

Q: Did you have a favorite food when you were a kid? 

A: Not really. I -- I never pa
id much attention to food. 
Q: And whe n you ate dinner at
 the house, or ate -- 
A: I -- I liked -- my mot her made carp Jewish style, sometimes. 

Q: Yeah?

A: Gefilte fish, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. And she cooked that? 

A: She cooked that, yes. 

Q: Huh. And when -- when you all were home 
a nd eating lunch and dinner, did you all eat 
together?  Your father came in, and you ate together? 

A: Yes. We  ate together
 in the dining room -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and we were served. 

Q: You were served dinner, uh-huh. 

A: Yes. [indecipherable] 

Q: Now, wa s this a very quiet meal, or was th
ere discussion about what was going on? It was a 
very serious kind of occasion? 

A: Mostly wa s serious, ye s.  
Q: It was serious. Wa s there discussion 
-- once Hitler took power in Germany -- 
A: Yi -- 
Q: -- was there discussion around the table about what was going on in Germany? 

A: Ah. 

Q: Do you reme mber? 

A: We did discuss it,
 yes, a little bit. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Not terribly much -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but a little bit, yes. I was 14 
years old when the war broke out -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
11 
 
Q: Yes, yes -- so you were -- 
A: -- so I was still a young fellow. 

Q: -- yeah, right. Now you were barmit -- Bar Mitzvahed in -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- 1938, am I correct? 

A: Right, correct.  

Q: And how long did you study for that? 

A: Oh, I had lessons for a -- 

Q: For the Bar Mitzvah. 

A: For the Bar Mitzvah at home. In school ra 
-- we had religion as a ma ndatory subject, and 
Jewish children would step out and go to a separate classroom -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- where we had a teacher, but we were usua
lly taught Jewish history more than religion. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- and at home I was taking pr
eparations for the Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: And did you like doing that?  You di
dn™t -- is this some thing you did? 
A: I did it, yes, yeah. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  that day?  Do you remember -- 

A: Yes, I reme mber beca -- I -- 

Q: Was there a lot of family there fr om both sides? 

A: All the family -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- came, and -- and also
 I gave a little speech. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
12 
 
Q: And wha t  did you talk about? 
A: That I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t reme mber.  

A: It had to do with a 
section of the Torah -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- I had read, yeah, but I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. Was there a 
party afterwards, at the house? 
A: There was a party at our house, yes, a big party, yes. 

Q: And did you feel proud?  Do you reme mber that -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- as a re -- a really
 important day for you? 

A: It was an important day. 

Q: And did you feel some thing changed once -- 
once you got to be Bar Mitzvahed and they 
claime d that you were a ma n now?  

A: We ll, I -- yeah, I was also interested because 
I discovered in the process my father was very 
proud that his fa mily was Levites, and that 
is sort of not common, but you know, the three 
categor ies, the [indecipherable], the priest s, 
the Levites and [indeciphe
rable] people and I was 
impressed that I was -- 

Q: A Levi. 

A:  - -  a  Le vi .  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
13 
 
A: And I mu st tell you when I was a child, I so
metimes had impressions that I will become  a 
prophet. I wa s very -- I sort of thought always
 that I was chosen -- 
a chosen child to do 
some thing, so -- 
Q: And was that connected to being a 
Levi, or did this happen before?   

A: No, this was before. 

Q: That was before. 

A: Right. 

Q: And did you have a particular kind of
 idea of what you were chosen to do? 
A: No. 

Q: No.  

A: No. 

Q: But you felt chosen? 

A: I felt chosen. I felt I was some
how inspired and privileged.  
Q: Did you ever tell anybody about this when you were a kid? 

A: I told my parents, yes. 

Q: Yes?  And -- and did they res
pond in a way that was okay?   

A: Yes. 

Q: Did they encourage you? 

A: No, they -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- they were a little surprised. 

Q: They were surprised. Do you think that -- in 1939 you were 14? 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
14 
 
Q: Right, when the war come s. Is there any ex
pectation that there™s going to be a war? 
A: Yes, there was expectation -- 
Q: So you expected -- 

A: -- ther e was tension in the ai r because Ge
rmany had post ultimatums dema nding that Poland 

give up the corridor between East
 Prussia and Germany, and -- and 
they were threatening, and -- 
and of course, before that was the invasion of 
Austria by the Ge rmans, so there was a lot of 
tension. People expected war.  

Q: And how did that affect you and the household?
 Wa s there talk of what you would do if there 
was a war, or was that not yet -- 

A: It was not yet -- there was talk before the war --  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- that I mi ght have to go to study at a fo
reign university because Polish universities were 
becomi ng dangerous. 
Q: Right. 
A: But we had not talked about leav
ing Poland before the war broke out. 
Q: And were you -- you ma y not know what your pare
nts were aware of, but were you in some  

sense by this time aware of wh
at was going on in Germany?  
A: Oh, absolutely. 

Q: And in Austria -- 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: -- with respect to Jews? 

A: Yes, absolutely. 

Q: You were. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
15 
 
A: We  were -- definitely were, yes. 
Q: So did this ma ke war that 
much more frightening to you? 
A: Yes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- it definitely ma de war more frightening. 

Q: Right. 

A: We  knew Germans ha d bad intentions towards Jews. 

Q: Towards Jews. 

A: Yes. And a lot of Germans were -- a lot of
 Jews were either deported by the Germans into 
Poland, or were escaping Germany to come  to 
Poland, so that it was common knowledge that 
things in Germany were just terrible. 

Q: And were people comi ng to your house? 

A: Not anybody. 
Q: Not anybody. 
A: That we knew. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So, on September first, 1939, when the war broke
 out and bombs start fa
lling, this must have 
been, even though you expected it, still a 
shock because the experience was -- 

A: It was still a shoc k, ye s. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was just before the school 
year started and we we
re still at home expecting to start school, 
and suddenly the bombs started falling, and -- an
d there was -- radi os were very primitive in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
16 
 
those days, they had crystal radi
os and you had to sort of tune 
them up with whiskers. And we 
listened. I used to take a ra
dio to -- to bed to listen. 
Q: And do you reme mbe r  the first time you heard a bomb?  
A: Sure I do, yes. 

Q: Can you explain what that was like? 

A: Well, the -- the bombs number -- they -- they e
xplode and they ma ke a lot of noise, and they, 
you know -- 

Q: We re you sleeping, or was this
 during the day?  Do you re -- 
A: Well, we had si -- to
 -- w-we had blackouts. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We  had to cover the windows, and we taped 
windows with s-stripes, sort of criss-cross -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- so that the glass wouldn™t fa
ll and hurt people, so -- and we
 knew -- it was both at night and 
in the daytime, yes. And actually, people st
ood watch in the neighborhood, on the streets, you 
know, there were sort of like citizen 
patrols and it was clearly war time. 
Q: Yeah. And was there an expect
ation that the Polish army c oul
d actually fight well against the 
Germans, or  wasn™t that sure? 

A: We ll, at -- at first there was, but it soonbecame clear that the army was  losing ground, and -- 

and my father reme mbered from the first World Wa
r that when a si -- [indecipherable] that sort 
of advance into central Poland was crossed, th
at that would mean that the Germans could 
advance without stopping, and -- and that™s when th
ey started talking about leaving. And first we 
talked about just my father and I leaving because
 me n were supposed to be in more danger than 
wome n, but then they -- my parents conferred an
d decided that we all should go. And there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
17 
 
discussion whether we should go 
east or south, and my parent
s weren™t that keen on going 
towards Russia, so we decided to go sout
h. And we had a car and -- but our car was 
requisi tioned, because the military were requisiti
oning all the cars. And my uncle had a car, and 
his car was sort of requisitioned, but he was fr ie
ndly with the provincial governor in Lwów, and 
he got the pass to keep the car to take the trip sout
h, but to return it later.
So my mother, my aunt 
conferred and they decided we could go with them. 
So my aunt and uncle left some  suitcases and 
took us instead. 

Q: Le-Let me ask you a little bit before. Doyou reme mber the discussions about whether to 

leave? 

A: Yes, I d -- reme mber. 

Q: You do?  You were
 sitting there. 
A: I was sitting there because there was the big 
question whether we were
 all going, or whether -
- 
Q: Or just the two of you? 
A: -- just the two of us. 

Q: And if it was the two of you, 
was there talk of your going on
 a bicycle?  Is that right? 
A: That was definitely a talk of going on a bicy
cle because we didn™t ha ve
 a car, and my father 
wasn™t so good on the bicycle and 
I wasn™t so good either, so -- 
Q: Uh-huh. Now, it seems to me  unusual that peopl
e would decide so quickl
y to leave. A lot of 
people didn™t. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
18 
 
A: During first of all the war, my -- independentl
y, my father and my mother™s family went to 
Vienna to leave the city because 
it was dangerous to stay in the c
ity, and Vienna was in Austria, 
so -- so they were used
 to the notion that -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- if war came, it™s sometimes important  to le
ave [indecipherable]. It was very dramatic to 
leave, yes.  

Q: We ™re going to have 
to stop for a mome nt -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to change the tape. 
End of Tape One 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Julian, you -- you ended by saying
 that it™s very dramatic -- it
 was a very dramatic time. 
Would -- could you describe what you -- what
 happened, and how you packed?  If you packed 
very much, and what you packed? 

A: We ll, it was very dramatic thinking about leav
ing, and we had numbe r of conferences, and we 
were ask by my aunt and uncle, since there was very
 little room in the car for -- ther e were four 

of us and my aunt and uncle, that™s si x people, 
and we had a driver because neither my father nor 
my uncle could drive. And so it™s seven people,
 and so we were aske
d to take, basically 
knapsacks, and -- back then, it was,
 and my mother packedasmall 
suitcase and my father packed 
a small suitcase. And my  sister, very fortunately
 took pictures, album of 
pi ctures, so that was 
very lucky, and we enjoyed that 
afterwards. Years later, it wa s 
nice to look back and have the 
photos. But we were -- it wasn™t yet full wi
nter, so it was just September, so -- 
Q: Right.

A: -- we didn™t have to p
ack very heavy clothes up. 
Q: You also had a dog, didn™t you? 
A: We  had a little dog, and it was very
 tough for us to leave the dog, yes. 
Q: What was the dog™s name ?  

A: It was Gigi. 

Q: Gigi?  

A: Which is like a bell ringing in Polish. 

Q: And wha t  sort of a -- 
what sort of a dog was this? 
A: It was a -- don™t -- don™t know the English word for it. 

Q: What was the Polish? 

A: In Polish it™s called yarmnic. 

Q: Wa s it a big dog, little dog? 

A: No, it™s a little dog, and it was ve
ry brown and I™m -- I ju -- the 
name  just -- English word -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- slipped out from my mi nd. 

Q: And who -- did you give the dog to some body? 

A: We ll, we left some body in the house. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: To take care of the dog. 

A: To -- well, no, the -- the lady who lived in with us -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- was taking care of the dog. And then we 
had janitor downstairs
, which -- I™m sorry. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
20 
 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What -- what was the hard
est part of leaving for you? 
A: Not knowing what will become  of us and where we were going. That was the hardest. 

Q: We re you frightened? 

A: We ll, we were frightened, partly that we mi
ght get into German hands and partly what will 
become  of us when we are away from home .  

Q: Right. Well, let me  ask you, it™s going to soun
d like a bit of a strange question. Your uncle 
has a car, you have a ca -- your fa
ther has a car, but neither of 
them drove. Wa s this typical of 
people who had a bit of money? 

A: Yes, it wa -- 

Q: That they have a car with
 -- without knowing how to drive? 
A: Right, it was typical if you had a car
, you could afford the driver, yes.  
Q: Did your father want to learn 
how to drive or he didn't care? 
A: He wasn™t -- 

Q: He wasn™t interested. 

A: -- interested, no.  

Q: Huh. It™s so odd given how in 
America we™re so car conscious 
that the notion of having a car 
without being able to drive is odd, isn™t it. 

A: Not [indecipherable] 

Q: So this must have been a pretty 
big car if you had seven people sitting. 
A: Right, it was a Buick -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
21 
 
A: -- with folding seats, so the two ki ds sit then
 --  sat in the folding se
ats, and my aunt -- my 
mother and my father sat in the back, and my uncle sat in fr ont with the dr iver. 
Q: So these were two -- like two 
little folding seat s in the back? 
A: Yes. 

Q: I see. Facing -- 

A: Facing the adults who 
were in the rear, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: No, they weren't facing the adults. 

Q: They weren™t? 

A: I think they -- they folded -- 

Q: Frontwise? 

A: Frontwise, yes.  

Q: Huh. So, you leave your house. Did your -- did 
-- your father must have taken money with 
him, or something that
 he could use as -- 
A: Right, my father took with him all the cash 
he could get his hands on, 
and he also had four 
bars of gold, and he was -- and he put them in
 a little suitcase and carri ed them with him. 
Q: Uh-huh. So he took Polish zlotys? 

A: Yes. But most of the money was Polish z-zlot
ys, I think. He may have
 had a little bit of 
dollars, or some thing -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- but not very much. 

Q: So how long a trip was this? Y
ou™re heading south to Roma nia. 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
22 
 
Q: Yes? 
A: We ll, we didn™t know yet we were going to Roma nia. We  partly 
were leaving to get out of the 
city because it was being bombed. 

Q: Right. 

A: But on the roads we saw a lot of people who 
were displaced and movi
ng and going different 
places, and occasionally there were German 
so called stuka bo mbers who -- which were 

dropping -- strafing people on the ro
ads. And we would get out and 
get in the ditch and then get 
up. And some ti me s along the road Polish soldiers 
would stop us and want the car. And my f -- 
uncle would flash the papers he ha
d, that he was allowed to have th
e car. So we finally ma de our 
way to a little town which was south, close to 
the Romanian border, and my parents must have 
thought already about going to Ro
mania, but I wasn™t quite -- 
Q: You weren™t quite aware of that. 

A: -- quite aware of that. 
Q: Right. So you were actually leaving 
and the Germans have yet to occupy. 
A: Right. 
Q: So you were really ahead of ever -- most people were not doing this. 

A: Right. And we stopped along the way in my fa
ther™s hometown, Rohatyn to say good-bye, so 
to speak, to his relatives, yeah. 

Q: Do you think he tried to
 convince his relatives -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- they should leave too? 

A: I don™t think so. 

Q: You don™t think so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
23 
 
A: No, because we had no way to help them with transpor tation and they -- I don™t think they 
discussed leaving. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  people saying to you, why 
are you leaving?  I mean, this is -- the 
people thought this would be -- 

A: Well -- 

Q: -- a kind of ma dness on your part. 

A: -- at that time, there were
 a lot of people who already ha
d left western Poland, and for 
example, in our city, in Lwów, my mother™s fa
mily had escaped from Kraków, which is more 
south central Poland, so people were all used to  the notion that some  
people are leaving and 
going, and roads were full of people. And people were moving all over the place. And it was 

clear that the Germans were going to occupy a
ll of Poland, yes. But in the end they didn™t 
because they had the agreement with the Russians, which was at first a secret agreement, it was 

not known. So, when we got to [indecipherable] whic
h is a town close to 
the border, we suddenly 
realized that the Polish 
governme nt was evacuating. 
Q: And you saw them evacuating. 

A: We  saw them.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Absolutely. And actually, we saw -- they we
re like buses which were
 -- had Polish gold on 
them, and the bank of Poland was evacuati
ng the gold. And we saw foreign embassies 
evacuating, and -- and we  saw the provincial gov
ernor with a horn, givi
ng the orders or 
directions regulating the traffi
c and -- and saying now mi nistryof foreign affairs, and there 
would be a bunch of limousines going and there 
was a bridge and they would go across that 
bridge to Roma nia. So we saw th
e whole Polish governme nt evacuating. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
24 
 
Q: And you had to wait, of course, 
until the whole Polish government -- 
A: Right. And we weren™t sure we would be al
lowed to cross, because there were st ill both 
Polish border guards and Roma nian border guards.  And we didn™t have 
a Romanian passport. 
But on the 17
th
 of September, the news came on the radi
o that the Russians had ma rched in, and 
ma ny peopl e thought that they were comi ng to 
help Poland, and -- atta
ck Hitler, because nobody 
knew that Stalin and Hitler had a pact. And -- 
and there was a lot of 
discussion whether we 
should go back. 
Q: Right. 

A: And my father thought that we 
should not go back and come back
 after we see the situation is 
quiet, peaceful and friendly. So we -- we decided to
 cross and -- and we basi cally -- my father 
had to bribe a Romanian guard
 to let us cross, yeah. 
Q: Did you agree with that?  Did you reme mb
er thinkingabout it? 
Did you agree with 
[indecipherable] 
A: Well, I -- 
Q: -- or you know? 

A: -- I want to go home. 

Q: You want to go home. 

A: Go home , yeah. I was not that smart, and my
 -- I -- I think it was a wonderful decision my 
parents ma de, yes. 

Q: Clearly saved your
 life, probably. 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No question about it, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
25 
 
Q: Mm -- 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: So you do cross into Roma ni
a, but your -- the car, the pe
rson who was driving your car -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- left you a bit earlier 
than you expected, I gather. 
A: Right. No, he left because he want to go back
 to his family and that was the deal with him 
before he drove us, that he would be able to go 
back and he was supposed to
 take the car back to 
the provincial governor, who wanted it, and so my uncle and aunt had passports, and had visas, 

so they were able to cross earlier, and we cro
ssed later. And I had also
 a cousin, their son, who 
had his own car, and he drove his car with his gi
rlfriend, and he had a passport and a visa, so he 
was able to cross earlier one.  

Q: So they had a visa 
to go -- get into Romania? 

A: Right. 
Q: So clearly, all the while, they knew th
at this was going to 
be where they --  
A: They mu st have -- 
Q: They mu st have known, right. 

A: -- been better prepared, yeah. 

Q: So, did your parents -- 

A: But we didn't have a visa. 

Q: Right. But you got into Roma nia, then did you 
have to get yourself a visa in order to -- 
A: Then we had to register ourse
lves to stay in Roma nia, but th
ere were a lot of Polish refugees, 
and some of them were being put in camps. But n-
not all. Mostly the military that  -- that crossed, 
were put in camps, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
26 
 
Q: Put in the camps. 
A: But we first went to what™s
 in Polish called [indecipherable]
 and [indecipherable] I think, in 
Roma nia, and we stayed there for a couple ni
ghts, and then we we
nt to Bucharest.  
Q: And by then you had a -- I mean, you registered, so you were oka -- you were see --  

A: I think we  regist ered really in Bucharest.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because we were afraid on the train th
at we mi ght get stopped, but we weren™t. 
Q: Were you welcomed in some way in Romania,
 that it was -- was it difficult when you came?  
A: Well, it was very diffi cult -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- because we didn't have that muc h money a
nd -- and at first we weren™t official, and -- but 
then in Bucharest somehow, they were regi ster
ing Polish refugees and -- and of course Polish 
governme nt had brought the gold with them, so they
 must have paid some thing to the Roma nians 
to allow the Poles who escaped to st ay there. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. And where did you stay in Bucharest? 

A: We ll, at first we stayed in a hotel. It was calle
d Hotel Victor ia then it was too expensive. Then 
we moved to another hotel, called well, I don™t 
reme mber the name  exactly, but we lived in one 
room in the hotel, and we had a hot pl ate and 
cooked our meals secretly because you were not 
supposed to use the hot plate in the hotel room. 

Q: So this is an extremely different situ
ation than what your whole life had been. 
A: Definitely. 

Q: Right?  

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
27 
 
Q: So were there problems  between all of you, or 
were -- were -- did you all rema in very calm 
and -- cause here you are all in one room now. 
A: Yeah. Well, ah -- there were 
no problems between us, my  mother, 
my father, my sister and I, 
but my mother my aunt had a problem, so -- 

Q: And wha t  was that about? 

A: I™m not sure, but some how they -- 

Q: Now that they were in the same  room with you? 

A: No, they were in a different -- 

Q: They were in another --  

A: -- hotel. 

Q: I see. 

A: They stayed in the first hotel. 

Q: Uh-huh. So -- but you don™t know what the pr
oblem wa s between your mother and her? 
A: No, no. 

Q: Yeah. And whose side -- whose -- whose side 
of the fa mily was the uncle and aunt on, your 
mother™s side, or your father -- 

A: My mother and the 
aunt were sisters. 
Q: Ah. 

A: My aunt ma  -- was my mothe
r™s oldest sister, and she -- 
Q: I see, I see. 

A: -- she was kind of a little bossy 
and -- to my moth
er, because -- 
Q: Uh-huh, because she was an older sister. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
28 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: She was quite a bit older, yeah. There were 
four sisters, and she 
was the oldest, and my 
mother was the youngest. 

Q: Uh-huh. Well, one can imagine the difficulties. 
Now, did you expect to stay in Romania, or 
was there always -- 

A: No, no, we started immediately -- my parents st
arted going, and my fath
er in particular, to 
different consulates, looking for avisa to go either to 
France or to the United States or -- and -- 
and of course you had to take 
a train through Italy to get to 
France, if you didn™t want to go 
through Germany.  

Q: Yes. 

A: So it -- and Italy was already 
allied with Germany, so it was 
quite complicated. And I started 
attending school in Bucharest, first French sc
hool, because I didn™t know Roma nian, of course. 
And in the French school I traded mathematic
s for French, so -- with other kids, so -- 
Q: So that [indecipherable] 

A: -- I was managing. 

Q: I see. 

A: No, in doing homework. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But then -- but then a Polish school was fo
rme d in Roma nia, and actually the Polish 
governme nt registered all the refugees, and ma y ha
ve paid even a small stipend to the refugees 
so that -- and also the Romanians who were w
illing to exchange Polish zlotys for Roma nian 
currency at the -- at the beginning, so -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
29 
 
A: So I started going to Polish school, and all the 
kids in the school, most of them were children 
of Polish governme nt officials. And they -- 
they were the ones who escaped, evacuated.  
Q: Right. And the person who was principal of th
e school wa s the wife of the head of the Polish 
bank, I gather, huh? 
A: We ll, one of the Polish banks. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Not the ma in Polish bank, yeah. 

Q: I see. And what was her name? 

A: Her name was Barrish -- bani -- Mrs. Barrish 
bani -- Barishowa in Polish, Helena Barishowa. 
And -- and she was a very wonderful lady, and made 
children all feel good. 
So I t -- I transferred 
from the French school to -- 

Q: French school to the Polish -- 

A: -- the Polish school, yes, Polish high school.  
Q: Now did that ma ke you feel a bit more comf
ortabl e, because you were with people who ca me 
from Poland? 
A: Right, and people who were in 
the same  situation, pretty much. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- and -- 

Q: Now, are you still one of 
the few Jews in this group? 
A: I was one of the few J e ws in that school, 
yes. There were a few,
 I wasn™t the only one. 
Q: There were a few, right. And did this 
ma ke any difference?  I mean, did -- did -- 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
30 
 
A: Not at all. 
Q: No. 

A: We  were all very good friends. 

Q: Uh-huh. And was everybody interest
ed in getting out of Roma ni
a, as far as you could tell? 
A: Everybody was interest in getting out of Roma
nia, particularly because Roma nia was itself 
about to be taken over by the Germans and th
e king of Roma nia was basically deposed by the 
Germans, eventually. So -- and the Roma nians 
said some thing was [speaks foreign language 

here] which is -- was kind of like an 
Iron Guard, I think, in English, that -- 
Q: You me a n the Iron Cr oss? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: The Iron Cross was it?  Or th
e Iron Guard [indecipherable] 
A: Iron Guar d, and they were very anti-Semitic, so 
that was a bit of a problem, but it wasn™t very 
-- it didn™t affect my lif
e too much, e xcept we knew we had to 
get out of Roma nia. So my parents 
succeeded in getting a vi sa to Palest ine. 

Q: They couldn™t get a visa -- 

A: Which was very difficult. 

Q: It was difficult. They couldn™t 
get one to the United States, right? 
A: No. My uncle and aunt left for the United Stat
es, they got a visa beca
use their son had a visa 
to the United States. He was supposed to go to
 the world -- world exhibition, oh what do you call 

it? World -- 

Q: Now I™ m forgetting what the name  
[indecipherable] too. The World Fair. 
A: World Fair. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
31 
 
A: Yeah. To the World Fair in New York. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Which was in 1939.  

Q: Right. 

A: And he -- and they an-and their son went and 
then the son helped them. They didn™t come  to 
the United St ates right away, they went to Fran
ce, and then fr om France to Portugal, and from 
Portugal to Cuba. And then from Cu
ba they came to the United States. 
Q: Huh. 

A: So -- but they left for Fran
ce, and we left  for Palestine. 
Q: For Palestine. 

A: Right. And my father -- we were lucky because  
that gold that my father had qualified us for 
what was called a capitalist visa. In ot her wo
rds, we had enough capital to enter, because 

Palestine immi gration was very limited, and you c
ouldn™t really enter Pale
stine as an ordinary 
refugee.  

Q: But you could qualify if you had enough money. 

A: If you had a certain amount of
 money, it™s the same  nowadays 
in Canada, if you have enough 
money you can become  a resident of Canada
, so a lot of people from Hong Kong -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- establish bank accounts and then return to 
Hong Kong. Well, this was a similar situation 
and we were lucky we got -- 

Q: Do you have any idea how much money 
it was that your father could afford? 
A: No, I don™t. 

Q: You don™t have any idea? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
32 
 
A: No. 
Q: And it was only the money that he ha
d with him, and especially the gold. 
A: Yeah, it was the gold. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was all he had, yeah. 

Q: Hm. So you have -- we ll, tell me  s o me thing, 
was it difficult to leave Roma nia because you™ve 
now been there from March until September, yes? [indecipherable] 

A: Right. It was -- it was 
difficult, we didn™t know what to expect at else -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- elsewhere. But we went by boat from Constan
za, which is a -- a harb
or in Romania, t -- and 
actually it was kind of a dream trip because we stopped in Istanbul and in Athens, and I got to 

see sort of beautiful sights of the 
world, and then we arrived in Haifa. 
Q: Well tell me a little bit about the trip. Who™s 
-- who is on the boat? A bunch of refugees like 
you, or not? 

A: Some  refugees, and so
me  people we didn™t know. 
Q: Right. Is this a -- a r -- a regular -- 

A: It was a -- 

Q: A cruise -- not
 a cruise boat. 
A: Not a -- 

Q: But a regular boat, was a -- 

A: A regular boat. 

Q: -- passenger boat. 

A: Yes, a passenger boat.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
33 
 
Q: And wha t  class did you -- 
A: Oh, the lowest class. 

Q: The lowest class, yes.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, ha d you -- had you bought clothes in Ro ma ni
a, because you came  with so little, so did 
you now have more? 

A: Yes, we -- we had a little bit more clothes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- yes, we  have a few more suitcases, yeah. 

Q: Than you had before? 

A: Yes. 

Q: When you stopped in Is
tanbul and Athens, was it for a few days, did you -- 
A: No, just for the day. 
Q: Just for the day? 
A: Yeah, but it was very meaningful and some thing -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- I reme mber s -- d-doing sightseeing, yeah. 

Q: And wha t  did you see in Istanbul, do you reme mber? 

A: I saw the big mosque, and -- and I saw 
the -- you know, the -- we saw the waters 
[indecipherable] you know, the cityis very beautiful city, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. And the same  with
 Athens, you walked around and you -- 
A: In Athens I saw Acropolis, and -- and I 
just was impressed to see Athens, you know. 
Q: Yes. So you arrived in March 
of 1940 to Palestine in Haifa. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
34 
 
A: In Haifa, yes.  
Q: Do you reme mber what that was lik
e?  Do you reme mber that arrival? 
A: We ll, I reme mber, and we were -- we stayed 
in the place that was on the hill, so we had a 
beautiful view of the harbor and Haifa is a rath
er attractive city, and -- and it was a good climate, 
it was warm, and we felt safe and comfortable w
ith the British controlled territory. The British 
were allies of -- of -- I mean, they were fighting 
the Germans, so that was a different world for 
us. 

Q: Right. Did you happen to have family in Palestine or not? 

A: Yes, my father™s cousin -- brother -- br
other, and his two da
ughters -- actually, three 
daughters had emigrated to Pa
lestine before the wa r. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So that two of the m lived on a kibbutz, and one of them lived in Tel Aviv, so we saw them, 

they were not very affluent, and they were some
 distance from Haifa, but we saw them and we 
enjoyed having the family there. 

Q: So had you intended to go to Tel Aviv?  Did you 
stay in Ha ifa for very long, or was that just 

fi rst  few days? 

A: For -- ma ybe for a couple of mont hs, some thing. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then we moved to Tel Aviv. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And were you taught some  Hebr
ew in -- during these couple of
 months ?  Was there a kind of 
school or anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
35 
 
A: No, not -- not -- no, no special education in Hebrew and no school til we got to Tel Aviv. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And whe n we got to Tel Aviv, I fi
rst started taking courses in English. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because we thought of going either 
to United States or  to England. 

Q: To England. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: I see. 

A: And -- yeah. 

Q: We ™re going to have to 
stop the tape [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, I -- that™s what I was wondering, yeah. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Julian, you s -- you went to a Polish high 
school again when you got to Tel Aviv. 
A: Right. I didn™t go to a Polish 
high school right away, first I t
ook a course in English. Polish 
high school -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- didn™t get established til later, because Po
lish refugees in Roma nia were evacuated from 
Romania to Palestine by the Britis
h, but we left, of course, on a vi
sa being Jewish, we left on the 
visa to Palestine. And -- and wh
en I first arrived there was no sc
hool, so I start taking course for 
what was called English ma tric
ulation. It was University of
 London ma triculation. And you can 
ma triculate when you are 16 years old, and -- an
d I was then ma  -- 1940 I was 15. So I started 
preparing for the ma triculation. And I was taking 
these courses and then we learned about the 
Polish high school being for med, because the ref
ugees arrived, and some  of them were our 
friends from Bucharest. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So I went to the Polish school, but I was stil
l studying English to finish the ma triculation. So, 
when I was 16, I ma triculated, which was also e
quivalent to admi ssion to University of London. 
In other words, I could later, when the war ende
d, become  qualified to go
 -- go to University of 
London because I had ma triculated. 

Q: So were you fluent in English by then?   

A: I was -- my mother actually knew a little En
glish and she bought a book and started teaching 
me  English and I wasn™t -- I knew no English when we arrived in Roma nia,
 but I started learning 

a little English fr om my mother. 
And then when I came to Palestine I took the courses and I also

37 
 
went -- there was some thing called Br itish council 
and -- and they were giving lessons in English 
in Jaffa. I used to go to Jaffa, take lessons. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. 

A: And I became not so fluent, but pr etty good, you know, good enough to take the exams.  

Q: Right. Now, where were you living in Tel Aviv? 

A: In Tel Aviv we lived at 40 Dizingof Street. 

Q: Really? 

A: At first we lived another place, and then we
 moved, and actually we moved ourselves with -- 
my father rented a little cart a
nd we loaded the cart and I pulled 
it along with my father and we 
moved to Dizingof Street, yeah. 

Q: And did you -- 

A: And we had the little apartment there.  

Q: And how ma ny rooms, do you reme mber? 
A: Two room -- two rooms. 
Q: Two rooms?  

A: Yeah. Two -- three rooms ma ybe, yeah.  

Q: And wha t  was -- did your father
 start working at this point? 
A: He was trying to do some  business, but mo
stly my mother started sewing, and she -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- wa -- became a seamstress, basically. 

Q: Really? 

A: [indecipherable] try a
nd ma ke mo ney this way. 
Q: So your life -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
38 
 
A: And then later she started giving sewing lessons. 
Q: Huh. So your life transfor ms , not only are yo
u going from country to country, from place to 
place, but everythi ng about your life turns upside down in a way. 

A: Right.  

Q: So does this teach you some thing?  Does 
this change your char
acter in some  way? 
A: It made me be very adjustable, and not really pay much attention to amenities and -- and --  

and -- and sort of made me view peop
le all equally, not be very concerned. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I always felt that I will get educated, 
I -- I sort of felt the i
nner drive to get a good 
education. 

Q: Did you lose your idea that 
you we re going to be a prophet? 
A: Yes, oh yeah, by then I did.  

Q: And does your sister go to the Po
lish high school as well as you? 
A: Yes, definitely, my sister we
nt to Polish high school, but she di
d not take the English courses. 
Q: She didn™t. 

A: She was more interested in French, and shewent to Polish high school. She was a year ahead 

of me , yeah. 

Q: So did you now see your future in what was then Palestine? 

A: No, I always thought that
 I would go to America. 
Q: You did. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did your parents think that, too? 

A: I think they did. They di
dn™t feel completely comforta
ble. They didn™t know Hebrew. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
39 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And my father grew up sp
eaking Yiddish actually, and he 
knew Yiddish. He always laughed 
that my mot her didn™t speak very
 good Yiddish. I mean, we a ll unders
tood a little bit of Yiddish -
- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but my father knew it well. 

Q: Right. 

A: But -- but Hebrew was a little different and -- 
and my father was at that time thinking more of 
the future for the children than 
for hims elf, and he thought the 
kids would be better off in 
America, yes.  

Q: Do you -- can you give me  some  idea of how 
old your parents were at
 this time ?  Is your 
father in his 50™s ma ybe? 

A: My father. I -- I™m not very good at ages. 
Q: Right. 
A: My father was 40 or so when I was born, ma ybe 40 -- 

Q: Okay, so he™s -- 

A: -- 42 ma ybe. 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- 

Q: So he™s in his mi d to late 50™s. 

A:  Lat e  fi ft ies -- 

Q: Right. And your mot her is nine years younger. 

A: Yeah, or so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
40 
 
Q: Okay. Now, are you learning Hebrew, 
is your sister lear
ning Hebrew?  Is -- 
A: Well, my  sister  was not particul arly interest ed in Hebrew. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I am -- learned 
a little bit, but I had no formal le
ssons, so I learned just by myself. 
Q: Right. So what was it like liv
ing there in Tel Aviv then? 
A: Ah, well -- 

Q: What do you reme mb er? 

A: Tel Aviv was, of course, ne xt to Haifa. Haifa was Arab, a
nd Tel Aviv was Jewish, and there 
were a lot of people from different parts 
of the world speaking 
different languages. 
Q: In Tel Aviv, yeah. 

A: In Tel Aviv. And Hebrew was not yet such
 an official language, you know, so the younger 
people all spoke it, but 
the older people spoke usually the 
European languages they had come  
with. So -- and it was very hot in the summer, 
that™s one problem with
 living in Tel Aviv. 
Q: Right. It™s very humid, isn™t it? 

A: And -- and -- and the climate -- 
I mean, it doesn™t get so cold, but
 it -- but it gets very hot, 
yeah. And I never really liked the sun so 
much, so that was one of the problems.  
Q: Did you go swimmi ng in the sea? 

A: Yes, I did, yes. We nt  swimming in the sea -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- went swi mmi ng in pools. And we -- in the 
Polish high school we some times went in groups 
as friends to the beach. And we 
-- but you know, the war was going on -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- and we were getting terrible ne
ws from Pol a nd already by then, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
41 
 
Q: And are you getting news of the kill
ings, or are you get
ting news of both? 
A: We  were getting news
 of the killings, also. 
Q: Uh-huh, you were. 
A: Yes, yes. Because some people were escaping from Roma nia, sometimes letters were comi ng, 

and we were beginning to get bad news. And -- a
nd in the Polish high school, m- ma ny of the 
colleagues in my class ha d already -- were alr
eady soldiers in uniform
 who were on leave to 
fi nish school. So we were all thinki ng of goi
ng back to war to fi ght Hitler at that point. 
Q: Right. And what was it like poli
tically in -- in Palestine at 
this time ?  Were you aware of the 
kinds of -- 

A: We ll, politically I was very awar
e of Jewish effort to ma ke Pale
stine into a Jewish st ate, and 
actually I had some  more distant 
relatives, and one of them was 
in Haganah, which is -- was the 
Jewish underground [indecipherable] organization, a
nd he tried to recruit me , and I went to a 
secret meeting, and -- but I decided 
I really didn™t want 
to fight the British, I wanted to fight the 
Germans. 

Q: And did you have a sense that there ought to be
 a Jewish state, or th
is was [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yes, I definitely -- 

Q: You did. 

A: -- had a sense that there ought 
to be a Jewish state, yes.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think all Jews had that.  

Q: But at -- at this very young ag
e, you did not want to stay there 
and fight the British in order to 
get a Jewish state. 

A: Right. [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
42 
 
Q: Yeah. So what -- 
A: Well my -- my priority was to fight the German
s. I was -- I was more interested in ending the 
war in Europe, yeah.  

Q: You™re studying at -- in the 
high school, but you™ve already 
attended some  high school, so 
what class do you start in when you™re in Tel Aviv? 

A: I -- 

Q: And is high school four year
s the way it is here?  It™s not. 

A: Well, in Polish --  in the Polish system just 
before the war and even now, it is six years of 

elementary school, and then four years of high 
school, and two years of something called lycee -- 
Lyceum or Lyceum in Polish, and -- but
 the -- th-the six years altogeth
er were sort of called high 
school because it was one unit. 

Q: Right.  

A: And in Poland they were separate, but here th
ey were one. Some  in Poland were together, but 
some  were separate. But I basically wa
s in the last two years of high school. 
Q: Right.  

A: [indecipherable] Palestine, yeah. 

Q: So did you start in 1940 or 1941? 

A: And mi nd you, I didn't  lose a si
ngle year of education, of school. 

Q: Really? 

A: Re -- during the war, because my parents 
were sending me  to school, and in Roma nia -- 
Q: In Roma nia. 

A: -- and in Tel Aviv, so that when I was 16 I 
got the British matriculat
ion, when I was 17, I got 
the Polish m-ma triculation. So I had sort of two high schools. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
43 
 
Q: Huh. So you graduated from this 
high school, when is that, in ™43? 
A: In ™42, actually, yes. 
Q: Two, uh-huh. 

A: And -- and I didn -- had the choice of either going to a university in Palestine, and 

Polytechni c at Haifa, or -- or 
--  or --  or  joining the Palestinian brigade, or  joining the Polish 

army. Now the military -- there was no conscripti
on because the Poles had no right to conscript 
anybody in Palestine, and -- and th
e British were not constrict -- co
nscripting Jews to go into the 
brigade, that was all voluntary, a
nd I decided to go along with all 
my friends to the Polish army, 
and my parents weren™t completely happy but respect
ed my choice, but they asked me to wait til 

I was 18, so I waited a few months 
and I joined the army in ™43. 
Q: Did they try to dissuade you from doing this? 

A: Not completely, they just wanted me  to
 wait a few months til I was a little older. 
Q: Now, from what I understand from the histor
y, it™s very unusual at that time for Jews who 
were living in Palestine to join Anders army rath
er than the Jewish brigade or the British, or to 
leave altogether and join Haganah [ind
ecipherable] one of the other groups -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- fighting the British. So you are an unusual 
Jewish person, doing this at this time , no? 
A: We ll, actually, all my Jewish colleagues in th
e Polish high school, we had ma ybe one-third of 
the students were Jewish. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: All of -- just about all of them joi ned the Polish army. 

Q: They did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
44 
 
A: Yeah. And -- and some  of the Jews who came 
with General Anders from the Soviet Union, 
stayed in Palestine -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- partly because they had had enough and they
 wanted to settle after being deported to 
Russia. But some  of us thought it was important 
for Jews to -- to fight, you know, and -- and to 
compensate for those who stayed behind, so -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- most -- most of my Jewish colleague
s went to the arm -- to the Polish army. 
Q: But did you consider going into
 the Jewish brigade that th-the
 rit -- British governme nt was 
for ming with -- 

A: I considered it, yes, because I had a Polish friend --  

Q: Who did. 

A: -- who was the son of my mother™s close 
friend, who did, but I decided against it.  
Q: And wha t  -- do you reme mber the reasoning th
at you used to decide one way rather than 
another?  

A: I sort of didn™t identify at 
that time, completely my future
 with Palestine, completely. 
Q: And with the Jew -- with whatever the Jewi
sh interest was particularly. So you felt both 
Jewish and Polish? 

A: Right. 

Q: And so you wanted to 
be able to express -- 

A: And I was interested in -- in 
s -- we  thought that we mi ght still 
return to Poland at that point, 
you know, who -- who -- who knows? 

Q: Right. So you actually 
thought it was possible? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
45 
 
A: We  thought it mi ght be possible. 
Q: To return to Poland with the army? 

A: No, no, n --  

Q: Or as a -- as a civi lian? 

A: -- no, possibly to live there, a
lthough United States was mo re li
kely. But my father still had 
the key from the house, that he -- 

Q: He did. 

A: -- treasured, and he thought some day he was going back. 

Q: That™s interesting. Now, we
re your parents also okay with 
your going into Anders army as 
opposed to with the Jewish brigade, or we
re they also not qu
ite so identified? 
A: They were okay with my -- 

Q: With that. Yes. 

A: -- with that, yes they --  they
 -- mo st of their friends werePolish Jewish refugees, or Polish 
refugees living in Palestine. There wa s a larg
e group of Polish refugees in Palestine. Many 
people don™t know it -- 

Q: Yeah.  

A: -- but the British evacuate
d the Poles fr om Romania. 
Q: Right. 

A: Through Cyprus to Palestine. 

Q: You™re a young person at this time, who wa
nts to go to school, who may have given up your 
dreams about being a prophet, but you clearly 
had ideas about a real future, but now you™re 
going to go into an army where you could very we ll get killed. 

A: Right, but I never tho
ught of getting killed.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
46 
 
Q: You didn™t? 
A: No. 

Q: You thought you would be protected, some how. 

A: Right, yes.  

Q: So, how do you go into this army?  Do you go to an office and you sign up?  What do you do? 

A: We ll, you go to the Polish consulate and you sa
y you want to volunteer for the army, and -- 
and they say well, thank you, and we will call 
upon you and you will have a me dical examination 
-- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and we™ll enlist you
. And then a few months  later, they did that. 
Q: And was -- was there an issue because you were Jewish, or they -- 

A: No, no, not at all. 

Q: No issue. 
A: No issue.  
Q: So did you wait a few months? 

A: Well, I waited til they called me. 

Q: Til they called you. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then you got called, a
nd then you [indecipherable] 
A: And then ™43, I wa -- 
early in ™43 I think -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- in February or so, I was 
called, and I first received the trai
ning as a recruit and that was -- 
my training was in Egypt on the northern 
side of Suez Canal on the -- in Kasasim.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
47 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Which is close to the Suez 
Canal, but on -- not on the Egyptia
n side, but on the Palestinian 
side. And I trained in tanks and it was quite di
fficult because when an offi cer moved his hand, 
you had to climb into the tank and he moved hi
s hand again you had to climb out and I was 
bruised all over from the me tal, climbing in a
nd out. But -- and you know, he
 closed the flap over 
your head, and you™re in a pretty closed envi
ronment and -- and I learned to drive a tank, I 
always say, before I learned to drive a car. 
And tank you drive by pulling with your hands. If you 
want turn left, you br-brake on the 
left and the tank rotates left. 
Q: Really? 

A: And [indecipherable] you want to turn to 
the right, you brake with your right hand and tank 

moves the other way, so -- and -- and we also 
had gun, and when the gun was firing it ma de a lot 
of noise over -- we were right ther
e. So I then had an opportunity 
to go to officer™s school, and I 
was very happy to leave the tanks, and go to the 
artillery officer™s school. And I became  what™s 
known in Polish as officer cadet, or [speaks Po
lish] in Polish. When you graduate you -- you get 
qualified to become  an officer, but
 you have to get promoted th
rough different ranks, and -- and I 
was assigned to light  anti-aircr aft artillery, which 
was fifth regime nt, or -- which was part of the 
Fifth Infantry division. And I wa
s assigned to go to Italy, because Polish army right then had 

participated -- was entering the Italian campaign. 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: And I was -- after I had, by the way, toured Cairo and seen the Sphinx and the pyramids, I 

ended up going to Port Said and -- 
and we took a boat to go to Italy. 
Q: Wait, let me stop you for a mo me nt. You said 
a while back that you were not very athletic. 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
48 
 
Q: So I™m wondering how all of th
is training was, that you we re 
training in the tank, not only did 
you get black and blue, but how 
difficult was this for you? 
A: We ll, I wasn™t very athletic w
ith bicycles or with running, but I 
was -- I did play
 soccer a little 
bit -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and I wasn™t that bad. [indecipherable] 

Q: Oh, okay. 

A: No. 

Q: But nevertheless, it wa s very diffe
rent from what you were used to. 
A: Right. 

Q: That kind of training, yes? 

A: Right, right, it was.  

Q: And it wasn™t intellectual, it was -- it was -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- very physical, and -- 

A: Very physical in the -- and -- 
and -- but there was -- it wasn™t 
-- it wasn™t a problem really. 
Q: It wasn™t. 

A: No. 

Q: And whe n you went to officer™s school, what
 does that me an, office
r™s training?  Cause you 
were a kid, right? 

A: Right. Well, I was -- but at same  time 
I was a good student, so I wasn™t so bad. 
Q: Right. Actually you™re not 
a kid, you were 18 years old. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
49 
 
A: Eight -- 18, yeah. And some  of the others ha
d more experience. I was 
one of the youngest that 
--  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- that in -- one of the youngest in the arm
y, and one of the youngest in the officer™s school. 
Q: And mos t  of the boys that you -- 

A: But I was used to that. 

Q: You -- you were used to that [indecipherable] 

A: To being young, yes.  

Q: Yes. But now, were ma ny of the boys in your un
it, if there was a partic
ular unit that you were 
with, had they had experience fighting?  Or had 
some  training before and you were unusual in 
that as well? 

A: Well, mo st of the other soldiers
 and officers had been in Russia. 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: All they had experience was being in Russian forced labor camps -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- in Siberia. 

Q: I see. 

A: So they were actually also very sort of used
 to not -- not being at 
home  for several years. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- and I w -- I was -- I was one of the fe
w -- I mean, in Palestine not that  many Poles 

joined the army in Palestine. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know?  Never mi nd Jews even, Poles, there were very few. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
50 
 
Q: Yes, Poles, right. 
A: So that most of them were vete
rans and most of 
them were older. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Most of the Polish soldiers at
 that point were older than we
 who c-came fr om the Palestinian 
detachment. 

Q: And how did -- uh-huh -- and how did they 
treat you?  We re they nice?  Were they okay? 
A: They were nice. I-I was treated like everybody else. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- and we then took the ship to go 
from Port Said to taran -- Taranto -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- which is at the foot of It
aly. And being light anti-aircraft ar
tillery, I was assigned to be in 
the anti-aircraft artillery
 or the [indecipherabl e] so, because 
the Germans were strafing allied 
ships that were going through 
the Mediterranean, so -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- so was four hours on and four hours off, wa s 
our routine on the ship -- aboard ship. So -- 
Q: Did you shoot down any planes? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: Not at that point. 

Q: No?  

A: Later, yes. 

Q: Yes? 

A: But not at that point, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
51 
 
Q: And how ma ny of you would be 
ma nning a -- the guns [indecipherable] 
A: It typically would be th
ree or four of us, yeah. 
Q: Uh-uh. 
A: Because the guns had one person cranking 
up ve rtically, one person cranking up the gun 
horizontally, so that™s two people -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in the seats, and one pe
rson loading the gun, and one person passing the ammuni tions, there 
was at least four. 

Q: And wha t  was your job usually? 

A: We ll, I usually was cranking and -- 

Q: Yeah? 

A: -- aimi ng, yes. 

Q: So you would aim?  That™s how you would do it, I see. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So the people who were cr
anking were actually aimi ng? 
A: Ai mi ng, yes. 

Q: Huh. Wa s that tough, on the boat? 

A: It was tough, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But -- but we didn't want the airplanes to shoot us. 

Q: To shoot you, right. Were you ab
le to -- to communicate with your
 parents, were you able to 
write home? 

A: Yes, I was able to write letters to my parents. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
52 
 
Q: Uh-huh. And were you -- 
A: But I -- we were asked -- one reason I later didn™t 
keep a diary in Italy is
 we were asked not to 
describe  where we are and what we we
re doing, so -- because of military -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- sort of secrecy, so -- which I regr
et to a certain exte
nt [indecipherable] 
Q: Did you keep a diary when you were training? 

A: No. 

Q: No, you didn™t do that either. 

A: No. I did write notes after we left Poland a
nd some  of my me mories were refreshed by these 
notes very much, yeah, how we left Lwów 
and how we got to -- yeah, to Roma nia. 
Q: Romania. 

A: -- yes -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- yes, I di d write that up very early on, 
but the military service I wasn™t writing. 
Q: All right, I think we™ll have to stop the tape.  
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
53 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Julian, I wanted -- before we go 
-- we get really into Italy and 
what happened there, I want to 
ask you a couple of questions abou
t Palestine. One is, you were in
 the boy scouts, am I right?  
Your sister was in the girl sc
outs, or some  kind of scouting? 
A: Right, she -- 
Q: Can you explain what that was? 

A: Also in -- in Poland, too, a little bit. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We ll, we had -- we had excursions with our
 friends and we would 
dress in khaki little 
uniforms, and go out and -- and stay in tents a
nd -- and practice shoo
ting and practice I don™t 
know, running and doing things together. 

Q: Shooting?  Now, isn™t that unusual for scouts to 
be doing, or is this some thing in Europe that 
happens as well as -- or was this unusual in
 Israel? I mean in Pa
lestine, I™m sorry.  
A: Mm, it was, I think in Poland too, there was 
-- people liked ma rkma nships, and I got to enjoy 
-- 

Q: You liked that? 

A: -- sh -- trying to hit the bulls-eye, yeah. 

Q: Did your sister do that as well
?  Did the girls do that as well? 
A: Girls also had auxiliary girl™s trai
ning, but I don™t think they were shooting. 
Q: Now, was there a relationship between the sc
outing groups and becomi ng part of the military? 
Was there a relationship in any way? 

A: N-No. 

Q: There wasn™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
54 
 
A: There was not. I mean, it just was natural 
that one mi ght prepare one for the other. 
Q: Right. 
A: But separate organizations. 

Q: Right. And how often would you meet? 

A: You know, I don™t reme mber, but -- 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: -- no, but mostly I reme mber the trips we took as kids. 

Q: And would they -- these trips woul
d be for a few days at a time -- 
A: Yes, exactly. 

Q: -- I gather, right? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: Overnight, yeah. 
Q: Now, tell me  about your relationships with 
the other students. I gather you were all quite 
close with each other, am I right? 
A: Yes. We  were -- we -- some  of us  have b
een together in Bucharest already and we were 
pleased to rediscover each other in Tel Aviv. 

Q: Right. 

A: And some of us just me t in Tel Aviv, but 
we were all very good friends. We  had the s-sense 
that we were all very lucky to 
be -- it was like a -- an oasis of
 peaceful living while our relatives 
were in Europe, or in the mi ddle of the war. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
55 
 
A: And we used to go swi mmi ng together, and 
we -- we all became very good friends, whether 
we were Jewish or Catholic or whatever. 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- and some  of our mothers and fathers 
would almost adopt the kids who didn™t have 
mothers or fathers, or who particularly didn™t have
 fathers, because the father mi ght have already 
been in the army or mi ght have been in England. 

Q: Right. 

A: So it was -- it was like an extended fa
mily, and we were all away from our norma l 
surroundings, so we -- 

Q: Right, right. Wa s this true of ot
her national groups, 
that -- that -- 
A: I don™t know of any other national groups. Th
ere was -- I don™t know that there we re other 
large national groups. 

Q: Uh-huh. As much as Polish. 
A: This Polish group was quite unique. 
Q: But now Palestine was not altogether 
peaceful either, at that time , right? 
A: It was reasonably peaceful. There were, 
you know, there were bombi ngs in a hotel -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- I reme mber, but in general, 
it was fairly or derly. It  was --  
Q: We re you ever -- 

A: -- good police organization. 

Q: Uh-huh. I know you were approached by 
-- with your cousin in the Haganah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did anybody for the -- from the Irgun try 
to enlist you in what
 they were doing? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
56 
 
A: No, no. 
Q: No. 

A: And Irgun started quite a bit 
later. There were rumors that
 Irgun was being helped with 
weapons from the Polish army because a lot of th
e -- a lot of the leaders of Irgun had come  with 
Anders -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you know, like Menachem Begin, and -- an
d there™s actually -- some body wrote a play 
called Begin and Anders.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Or Anders and Begin, which -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- which discusses the relationship. Begin said 
always that he left on a leave of absence and 
the Polish army never pursued to get him back, so 
he w -- as opposed to being a straight deserter, 
he was actually -- just  left  on a extended leave of absence. 

Q: Right. Did you ever meet any of the boys
 who had left the army?  The Jewish boys? 

A: No, no. 

Q: You never met them?  

A: No. 

Q: So you never got an opportunity
 to talk to them as to w
hy they ma de that decision. 
A: No, but I knew some  people who ma de this deci
sion, and it was mostly because they had been 

through so much turmoil that when 
they got to Palestine they just
 thought it was time  to end all 
this wandering around. 

Q: Right. So let™s go to Italy. You land in Italy. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
57 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: In Taranto, right?  

A: Right. 

Q: In February of 1944, I gather. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right?  And you™re in a light anti-aircr
aft artillery unit, 
is that correct? 
A: Right. 

Q: And you™re heading north? 

A: Right. And light anti-aircraft 
unit, although it wa
s a division -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- different batteries were assi
gned to different infantry units, 
so we were basically in support 
of infantry. 

Q: I see. 
A: W -- we were not like h
eavy artillery which sits back
 and shoots, we were -- 
Q: So you™re ma rching along with infantry? 
A: -- with infantry, right, and each -- each battery 
sort of separately, so we
 were seldom together 
as a whole regime nt.  

Q: I see. 

A: And we -- and the guns were attached to a 
small truck, and were being pulled by truck, so my 
next skill was I learned to drive a truck. 

Q: So you -- so you went from the tank to the truck. 

A: I went from the tank to the truck. 

Q: And wha t  was the regime nt that this unit was fr om?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
58 
 
A: This was Fifth Division. Ha
d symbol which was a bison. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And it was called Fift h Krisova divisi -- Kr
isova meaning the edge of Poland, and it™s the 
eastern edge of Poland, it™s called
 Kresse, and the division was in
 honor of the eastern edge of 
Poland. 

Q: So this is part of the sec ond Polish army, the [indecipherable] 

A: Oh, the second Polish division. 

Q: Division. 

A: Yes. We ll, there were actually -- I™m sorry, second Polish army. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes. And the second Polish army had the Fi
fth division and Third di
vision -- Third division 
and Fifth division. There were not too ma ny divisions. 

Q: There weren™t? 
A: There were two or three divisions. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And we had British uniforms, but Polish insi
gnia. On our -- our arms  here it said Poland. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we had a bison for the division and we 
had a symbol of the British Eighth Army, which 
happened to be a cross. And -- 

Q: And you wore a beret as well? 

A: And we wore beret, and -- a
nd it was a regular khaki beret, not
 a black beret like I had in the 
tanks. And on the beret it was a Polish eagle. 

Q: With no British sign. Was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
59 
 
A: No, no, no. 
Q: I see. So you™re traveling nor
th and you™re going to come  into 
one of the biggest battles over 

there. [indecipherable] 

A: Right, we first fought along the Ad
riatic on the east coast of Italy. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then, when we got some  way, half way -- 

Q: To Italy. 

A: -- Italy, we were asked to go 
west and to cross over to the we
stern side. And I think it started 
some where at Forli is the name of the tow
n. And I reme mber going through a town called 
Predappio where Mussolini was born and I was 
very impressed. And actually, before I left 
Palestine, I went to a lecture once by a for mer 
high commissi oner of Pales
tine and he was talking 
about his military experience in World War I and 
he was saying one thing he did was because in 
the army you have a lot of time, he s a id, I read
 books, you know, and I was so inspired. He said 
he picked three most important books and he r
ead them, so I picked the same  three books, I 
think, which was -- one was the Bible, the other 
one was Macaulay™s ﬁHistory of Englandﬂ, and 
the third one was the history of the Roma n e mpi
re. And I kept reading them, and also learning 
Italian as we traveled through It
aly. So that then we crossed we
st, and we went to the area -- 
Montecassino area and mon -- 

Q: Tell me  some thing, y -- y -- go back for 
a mo me nt. You have a lot of time to read? 
A: Well, in the army you have lot of time, yes. 

Q: Yeah?  Ca use you™re waiting a lot? 

A: You™re waiting a lot, yes. 

Q: Did other boys read as much as you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
60 
 
A: Not as much. 
Q: -- you were very unusual, yes? 

A: I was ma ybe more unusual in that respect. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the other boys learned a li
ttle bit of Italian, sort of 
conver -- conversational Italian. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But I was more really doing systematic self study. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So then we got to Montecassi no, and the s
ituation was that -- and Montecassino is located 
between Naples and Rome , and this was about th
e time when the British -- the United States 
army, U.S. army had landed in Anzio. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the bri -- American troops we re surr
ounded and stopped there and couldn™t break out. 
And the critical position was 
the -- the mountain with the 
monastery on top, Montecassino 
mountain. And there were three or 
four assaults by the British a
nd the French and the Australians 
and none of them succeeded, and then the Polish tr
oops were called to -- to take their turn at 
taking the mountain. And our commander, General A
nders issued an order of the day in which 
he said to -- the battle for Montecassino is the ba
ttle for freedom of Poland. And Polish soldiers 

took it to heart and fought very
 hard, and after a fe w -- and by the way, at Montecassino, we 
were -- my unit was ma de into infantry beca
use the guns couldn™t be pulled up the mo untain. 
And we were all crawling, rock
 by rock up the mountain and the 
-- it was -- there was also a lot 
of bombardment because the British were 
-- and Americans were dropping bombs on the 
monastery, which was considered 
an observation point for Germ
an artillery. And the Germans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
61 
 
were in bunkers all along the mountains, so i-itwas a very difficult situation. It was in May of 
1944, and then in the end, Polish 
troops took the monastery at 
the top of the mountain and 
mounted the flag, Polish flag and the Br
itish flag at the top of the monastery. 
Q: And -- and what was your 
-- your role?  You were holding 
what ?  What kind of -- 
A: I was actually doing some  mortar shooting.The mortar we could carry up the mo untain, but 

also with my rifle climbing and 
ma king my way up the hill. And -- 

Q: This was not your first battle, or was this a -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- [indecipherable] battle 
that was this rough for you? 
A: This was the roughest battle, because -- in
 part because I was not at my gun, but -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- on my own. 

Q: On your own. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Then who -- 

A: And we had to carry the ammunition up the 
mountain, up the slopes, because cars couldn™t 
get up there.  

Q: Right. 

A: No trucks, no cars. 

Q: Now I -- as I understand it, there was a first pu
sh and it didn™t work, and -- and Anders had to 
re -- decide what to do now, what sort of a st
rategy to use to go up the 
mountain [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, well I was not pa
rt of the strategy, but -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
62 
 
A: -- there were several assaults, but -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in the end the tr
oops went around, and -- 
Q: Did you get to the top? 

A: I got to the top, yeah. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did ma ny of your buddies get kill
ed, or get hurt in this -- 
A: Several of my friends got killed, 
yes. The casualties were very heavy. 
Q: We re very high. 

A: And to this date there is a Polish ceme tery 
at the foot of Montecassi no that has ma ny graves. 
And some of them were wounded. I 
was very lucky to come  through. 
Q: You were -- you weren™t even wounded? 
A: No, I was -- 
Q: That™s very lucky. 

A: -- very lucky, yes. 

Q: How did it affect you to be in a battle with
 so many casualties? Was this extremely difficult 
for you e motionally afterwards? 

A: Well, it was very difficult emotionally while it 
was going on, but afterwards I felt very lucky 
to have -- have come  through unscathed, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I was very proud also, of having particip
ated in what was a pr
etty critical  battle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
63 
 
Q: Right. And when you think about Anders saying we™re fighting for the freedom of Poland, 
was that what you were fi
ghting for, or were you fi
ghting for [indecipherable] 
A: Well, I was mostly fi ghting for the fr eedom
 of my relatives and fellow Jews, but -- 
Q: Mm-hm, yes. 

A: -- but they were in Poland, so -- 

Q: Right. 

A: And at that time  we didn™t know yet that 
eastern Poland had been basically given away by 
Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was -- 

Q: But by this -- by this time  it™s clear to you -- 

A: By the -- 

Q: -- that  millions of Jews have been killed? 
A: Right. 
Q: Right, and -- 

A: Right, we -- we knew that already, and -- an
d I reme mbe r  at the same time comi ng across a 
body of a German and reading a letter he had written 
to his relatives, or hi
s relatives had written 
to him, and I could see that they had huma
n problems too, you know, being away from their 

fa milies, but -- but -- but we knew Je
ws were being killed in a -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- brutal way in gas chambers and so on. And 
we -- when we finished the battle, we  were 
given a break, a little rest. 

Q: And whe r e did you go?  Or did you just stay where you were? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
64 
 
A: We ll, we stayed in the area. I reme mb
er once on the mountain, comi ng across some  
Moroccan troops which were fren -- part of the 
Fr ench army, and we couldn™t communicate with 
them too we ll, so we were just as -- we  were 
scared of them [i ndecipherable]. The worst thing 
was walking at night, and you know, in differe
nt forests or empty areas and when you stood 

guard that was pretty difficult situation becau
se some ti me s you could be -- Germans could be 
attacking, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: But that wasn™t at Montecassi no, that was el se
where. We were -- we were also getting leaflets 

from the Germans. They were dropping leaflets
 telling us, why are you fighting us, you should -- 
the Russians are killing Poles in -- in Russia. And 
my friends had all been in Russia, so they all 
were very aware that the Russians were very ba
d people. So -- that had 
-- had them deported, and 
had them in forced labor, but they wanted to fight the Germans, too. 

Q: Right. 
A: I don™t know of anybody who deserted. 
Q: Uh-huh. So how long was this
 break after 
this battle? 
A: It was a short break and we were then sent to
 the east coast of Italy 
back again and we fought 
at -- I fought at -- and the Polish army at Ancona
, Bologna, at Loreto, a
nd then at Bologna. And 
there is a Polish cemetery in Loreto, and ther
e are Jewish graves there, as there are at  

Montecassino. 

Q: Who -- who dug graves at Mo
ntecassino?  Did you boys do it? 
A: I didn™t do it. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
65 
 
Q: Did the army do it [indecipherable] 
A: I think the army must  have done it, yes. Must
 have been the army, but they were probably not 
the front line troops, but the sort of service units.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: Sort of divisi
onal support units.  
Q: So you™re in a number of other battles along the way? 

A: Right. And -- 

Q: Does it ever -- does it ever 
get easier before
 each battle? 
A: No, it wasn™t as difficult as at casino, but it wa
s difficult, for example at one point, we had to 
retreat and that was very unpl
easant. But -- but we  -- the British and the Americans were 
interested in keeping th
e Italian front active to distract the 
German troops and extend their supply 
lines so as to make the landing in France easier, a
nd to ma ke the invasion of France easier. So we 
weren™t pushed to advance very rapi
dly, we were going rather slowly. 
Q: Did you ever come  across camps th
at the Italians had set up, or not? 

A: Not camps -- with Jews?  Or camps -- 

Q: Th-They had all sort
s of people in the -- 
A: Yeah. No, no. We  saw some  Italians who were
 si -- fighting on our side. There we re some  
Italians fighting on our side, but I 
didn't  come  across Italian camps. 
Q: And were the Italians that you me t happy about your being there? 

A: It was mi xed. Most people were afraid of so
ldiers and soldiers do some times take food and 
wine away from where they -- in the country
side, wherever people tr
ied to -- supplies are 
difficult during the wars, so some ti me s the farmers kept storing things for themselves -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
66 
 
A: -- and sometimes soldiers would take it, 
and so metimes soldiers would kill chickens. 
Q: So people were nervous [indecipherable] 
A: So that the Italian -- but the Italians in general were fr iendly. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They were not -- there -- ther
e -- it was not hostile 
territory. And they -- most of them didn™t 
like the Germans. 

Q: Right.  

A: Even though some  of them were Fascist, you know. 

Q: But it was a different kind, I guess. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I reme mber in Ancona going 
to the synagogue for high holidays. 
Q: Really? 
A: And the army had a rabbi, a
nd occasionally we  had services. 
Q: Hm. Interesting. So in May of 1945, the war is over. 
A: The war was over ra -- around th
at time. We were approximatel
y at the level Bologna and the 
war ended and we were very happy. It ended, but 
there was a question what
 will become  of us, 
because most of my colleagues like myself were
 from the eastern part of Poland, which by now 
we knew wa s going to become  part of Soviet Un
ion. And I -- all the soldiers were given a 
declar ation fr om England that -- fr om Britain 
--  fr om the British which said that  we ar e 

encouraged to return to Poland and that they 
had the commitment that we would be safe when 
we came ba ck to Poland, or since we had foughton the British side, if 
we didn™t choose to go 
back to Poland, we could go to Great Britain. An
d -- and most of the soldiers went to Great 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
67 
 
Britain, and -- but some  who had fa milies return
ed to Poland. You know, some  had left their 
children and wives at home . And I knew I wasn™t
 going back to Poland, so -- which wa s now in 
Soviet Union, so I had no problem decide 
-- to become  repatriated back to Poland. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And I was hoping to come  to America, and -- but what was very nice is that when the war 

ended, you know, Ande rs said, since Poland has lo
st so ma ny me mbers of its intellectuals, 
professionals, that he  wanted the young military to be educated, and we were offe red an 

opportunity to attend Italian universities. And -- a
nd I opted to go to the Polytechnic in Turin, 
Italy. A-And some  others who want to study me di
cine went to Bologna, 
some  others went to 
Rome , some  went to Milan. So there were 
all these Polish young o
fficer cadets, and young 
officers, who had ma triculation and were r
eady to study and suddenl
y going to Italian 
universities and -- and in 
the -- in Turin there was a sort of dor
mitory for the Polish soldiers and -
- who were studying, and I was in that dormitory.  
Q: And you were still in uniform?  
A: I was in uniform some of the time. I didn™t have
 so ma ny civilian clothes, but we  could be in 
civilian clothes at that
 point. And then -- 
Q: Let me -- let me stop you for a moment if I 
may. When the war is over, are you folks guarding 
Germans?  [indecipherable] prisoners of war? 

A: Oh -- ah -- oh, what happened was, since I knew
 -- yes, we  saw German prisoners of war, and 
-- and si  -- w-we were either  guarding them or seeing them being guarded by the British. But I 

am also la -- was assigned to a camp where 
the Br itish were sorting out people they had 
liberated. Since I spoke English, I wa s used as 
a Polish translator for those who were from 
Poland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
68 
 
Q: Right. Let™s continue that
 on the next tape, we™re going 
to have to stop this tape. 
A: Yeah. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Julian, explain what you were doing in
 this transit camp, for the British. 
A: Yes, I was assigned as an interpreter to a cam
p where there were a lot of people who had been 
liberated and were from all diffe
rent countries. Europe was -- Germans ha d taken people from 
different countries for forced 
labor. From France, from Turkey, from Poland, and from Holland. 
And when the war ended, some how we were -- this
 camp was close to the Austrian border, and a 
lot of people were brought in, in
cluding some  who had been in Maut
hausen as prisoners of -- as 
prisoners in the German camp. And some  had not b
een in camps, but had been in forced labor in 
different factories or doing diffe
rent jobs. And it was a sea of hu
ma nity, and -- and they were out 
in open areas, so some  of them just warming 
themselves up by fire. And -- and w -- and some  of 
them were fr om Russia and from Ukr aine. And th
e British wanted to send all these people home. 
And there were trains and the job in the camp 
wa s sorting people, finding out who they -- where 
they were from. And some  of th
e m didn™t want to go back, in pa
rticular the Russians. Some  of 
them were White Russians, who had collaborated w
ith Germans, or who were afraid that they 
would be accused of having collaborated with 
German. So it was quite a me ssy scene and some  
of them were basically forced onto the trains an
d -- and al so I saw Serbs be ing take  -- Serbs were 
taken prisoners because they had fought together 
with the Germans, and they were being shipped 
back to Serbia. And -- some  Serb
s, anyway. And -- and -- and ther
e were Polish people, which is 
why they needed Polish interpreter. And they 
were trying to fi gure out who was who and where 
they should go and where they belonged. And so
me  desperately wanted to go home , and some  
were afraid to go home . So -- 

Q: And your job was what?  To -- 

A: To -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
70 
 
Q: -- question them [inde cipherable] 
A: -- to question them and get in
formation where they were from, and -- and how they got there. 
And -- 

Q: What was the -- 

A: -- to verify their stor ies. 

Q: Right. Were some  people more difficult -- 

A: It was a British operation. 

Q: Right. 

A: I was just assigned as an interpreter. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was not a Polish army operation. 

Q: Now, I -- as I understand it, you me t some  
pe ople who came from Ma uthausen, the men. 
A: Right, I met -- 
Q: Was -- that must have been 
a very difficult story to hear. 
A: It was a very difficult situation to see these pe
ople because they were like skeletons and they 
were basically supporting each other, and barely 
able to move and walk, and -- and -- and they 
were still in the stri
ped prisoner gear, yeah. 
Q: Now is this the first time  that you had me
t -- me t anyone, as opposed to just hearing the 
stories -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- who had been through so
me  of the most diffi cult -- 
A: First time, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
71 
 
A: It was the fi rst time. 
Q: And wha t  did that
 do to you?  Anything? 

A: Well, it moved me very much, and it certainl
y ma de me  realize what people had been going 
through during the war. 

Q: Right. And were you in favor of what the Bri
tish were trying to do, or did you think this was 
wrong? 

A: We ll, I was in favor of people being sent home,
 but I think there could have been a little more 
humanity to it. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they didn™t have the amenities. Some of them -- some  of them were -- they were being 

packed -- someti mes when I see the movie lik
e ﬁShoahﬂ, and I see how the Germans packed 
people, it wasn™t that bad, but it was -- some  of
 i t  was forced packi
ng of people onto trains. 
Q: Uh-huh. And how long were you 
doing this?  A month, two months? 
A: Probably like a coupl
e of months, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And was it after that that you were give
n the opportunity to go to Turin and go to the 
university? 
A: Yes, it was after that, yes. 

Q: Did you happen to know that Primo Levi
, was he anybody that was known, wh-who came 
back to Turin, who lived ther
e for the rest of his life? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, I didn™t. 

Q: Not at the time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
72 
 
A: No. 
Q: Did you like going to the university there? 

A: We ll, I liked very mu ch, yes. 

Q: Yes.  

A: It was a relief and a reprieve  after service in
 the military and then we again all got along very 
well, and -- and we were 
like a close group together. 
Q: Right. 

A: Eventually I moved out of the dormitory to a 
private apartment with another Polish colleague.  
Q: Right.  

A: With whom I™m still in touch, you know, lives in
 Florida, he™s a Catholic, but he calls me  up 
very often.  

Q: Now tell me  some thi ng, because people ma y not 
know, was there a lot of destruction in Italy, 
because it seems -- it coul d seem surprisi
ng that a university would be open -- 
A: Well, in Turin ther e wa
s very little dest ruction. 

Q: Very little. 

A: Al most no destruction. 

Q: I see. 

A: Turin, Genoa, Milan, were not really destructed too much.  

Q: Yeah. And your Italian was goodenough to go to the university? 

A: Yes, my Italian-- 

Q: By then, yes? 

A: -- was quite good, yes. And I took a sort of engi
neering course, yeah. First year of engineering 
it was called. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
73 
 
Q: So, are you, throughout this period, are you 
able in some  way to communicate with your 
parents? Are you a -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and your sister, 
you™re able to write? 
A: I was able to write and send letters, and once 
I was even given a leave of absence during the 
war to go back to Palestin
e and visit my parents. 

Q: Really? 

A: By boat, of course. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. And with a few other Polish friends -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who had relatives in Tel Aviv, or some  -- 

Q: So that must have been a very nice thing for you to [indecipherable] to do. 
A: It was a nice interlude, yeah. 
Q: And did you then, when you me t  your parents 
and your sister, discuss what you would do?  
Cause it was clear that the allies were going to win by this time. 

A: Right. 

Q: I mean, it probably wa s clear even before. 

A: Right. And we at that time started correspon
ding with my aunt who was then in New York, 
and -- 

Q: Now this is the same aunt, this is the sister -- 

A: The same  aunt, yes. 

Q: The [indecipherable] right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
74 
 
A: Yes. And we were trying to ge
t a visa to come  to the United 
States, and -- and actually, at one 
point I -- my aunt [indecipherable] was in her se
cond ma rriage. In her firs
t marriage, her married 
name  was Ulam, and her nephew, son of her 
husband™s dead -- the husband died, she was a 
widow before she rema rried. And he was in the 
United States, his name  was Stan Ulam. He was 
-- later became  known for inve
nting the hydrogen bomb. But he 
was at University Southern 
California and he was a ma the matician, an out
standing, world fa mous ma t hematician. And he 
also then went to New Mexico, or to -- to Los 
Alamos to participate in the development of the 
bomb. And he was well connected, 
and he got me an admi ssion to the University of Southern 
California. So I went to the cons
ulate in Genoa to see the American consul to pick up the visa, 
and the consul asked me , do you want to stay in 
the United States?  And I 
said, of course. And it 
was absolutely the wrong answer, because the mome nt
 I said that, I couldn™t get the student visa, 
because st udent visa is only for temp orary st ay as a student . 

Q: Right, right.  
A: So the consul said, you have to apply for 
regular immi gration visa. And Polish quota was very 
tight because at those ti -- in those days, each co
untry had a quota, and since a lot of people from 
Poland were displaced, the Polish quota was very di
fficult to -- to get th
e immigration visa, and it 
was like a three year wait. So I didn™t get the i
mmigration visa til after 
I got to London. So my 
trip to Genoa was wasted, but my
 aunt finally send me the -- the 
papers to -- affidavit to -- to 
apply for the visa. 
Q: Now, are your -- your parents a
nd sister trying to get to the Un
ited States at the same time? 
A: My parent s and sister -- well, my sister we
nt to study in Beirut, Lebanon, because she didn™t 
want to study in English or in Hebrew. S -- and 
she was interested in French, and in Beirut she 
first went to the English univers
ity, but transferred then to the French university, she studied 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
75 
 
me dicine. And so my sis t er was already in Beirut
, not with my  parents, and I was in the army. 
And the British then offered to evacuate Poles from
 Palestine. Just before they were going to 
leave Palestine, they evacuated Poles who wanted
 to leave, to Great Britain. And my parents 
communicate with my sister and she came and togeth
er they left  fr om Palestine to --  to go to 
England, yeah. And I was alrea
dy in England at that time . 
Q: Oh, so you got there before. 
A: I got there before. 

Q: And so you were -- 

A: The British didn™t want to keep
 Polish soldiers in Italy too long. 
Q: Right. 

A: And actually, the better student
 you were, the longer you could st
ay. So I stayed quite long in 
Italy to complete my first year of 
engineering, and then
 I had to leave. 
Q: Right. Now, was there any thought on your 
parent™s part to stay in Palestine? 
A: Not really, no. 

Q: No, uh-huh. And you had no interest to go -- 

A: To return back, no. I was in
terest to start a new life. 
Q: Right. 

A: And whe n I got to England, the Br itish wanted
 to have better control 
over Polish soldiers in 
England so they put -- so they in
corporated us into some thing cal led Polish resettleme nt corps.  
Q: Right. 

A: Polish resettlement corps was a British unit for 
Polish soldiers. It was not to fi ght, it was just  
to control them. And then, people who were in Po
lish resettlement corps could either get leave of 
absence to go to study, or they had to go to wor
k. In Britain at that time there was comp ulsory 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
76 
 
labor actually, yo-you had to work, so you had to
 report to the employme nt office, and they 
would assign you a job if you couldn™t find one. 
Q: Right. 

A: And a lot of Poles ended up in coal mi nes, 
and -- because [indecipherabl
e] Britain, so -- but I 
was one of those lucky ones who were given a 
-- an -- an -- an opportunity to go to London and 
study, and I started in some thing called Polish Univ
ersity College, which doesn™t exist any more, 
but was preparing Polish for mer so
ldiers to take degr -- amer -- 
British degrees. And at that time 
University of London ha d a program which was ca
lled external program, so
 that you didn™t have 
to attend the university, you could just
 take exams as an external st
udent. And I couldn™t get into 
any British university, they were
 all fully booked, so I went to 
this Polish University College, 
and I start preparing for what™s called part one 
of the Bachelor™s degr ee for the University of 
London external examination. And 
then -- and I took that examination and when I passed I 
transferred to Worcester Polytechni c, which wa
s sort of a college, but again the exams were 
external University of London exams, and I wa
s preparing for part tw
o, and I was going through 
it pretty quickly so that by 1949, when I was 24, I 
was ready to take the Bachelor™s degree exam, 
but then my visa arrived from the United States
, and the Amer ican consul would not renew it. I 
wanted to wait til June, it was March, and he said
 he couldn™t renew the visa, I would have to go 
to back of the line. So I went
 to the university office, and I 
asked them whether I could go and 
take the external examination in Canada, whic
h was at that  time a British -- part  of British 
empire. And the -- well, I said 
even ma ybe should come  back 
to London because be it™d be 
cheaper than taking a whole year of study. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
77 
 
A: And they said, well what we will do, we w
ill se nd you the examination papers to Ne w York. 
So I did my Bachelor™s degree -- 
Q: In New York? 

A: -- in New York. I was at Columbia Universi
ty under the supervision 
of some body the British 
designated to supervise I was not cheating.  

Q: Did your parent and 
sister go before you? 
A: My parent s, sister left for 
United States before me , yes.  
Q: And they -- and -- 

A: Because they had no reason to st ay -- 

Q: To stay. 

A: -- behind, yeah. 

Q: But when your parents were in [indecipherable] 

A: Actually my sister went from Engl and back to
 Beirut to pass her fina
l examination to become  
a physician, and then she came back. 

Q: And then she came to the United States. The peri
od of time  that your parents were in England, 
were you living together? 

A: When we  were living in England we were 
not living together, no. I 
lived in Kent, near 
Worcester Polytechni c. 

Q: I see. And was your father working [indeci
pherable] and your moth
er?  What was going on? 
A: My father was doing some  kind of me nial 
work and my mother was sewing and earning 
money by sewing, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. So the period of time when you were
 in Palestine, while you were in the army, 
fighting, was she ma inly supporting the fa mily by her sewing? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
78 
 
A: She was supporting and I think they were 
getting a stipend from the Polish governme nt. 
Q: I see. 
A: Like all the refugees. 

Q: Right. So -- 

A: That™s most likely.  

Q: Uh-huh. So did everybody land in New Yo
rk? Is that where you [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, my  parents landed in New York and my
 sister, and they moved into an apartment and 
my father got different jobs selling newspapers
 in a kiosk and making deliveries and my mother 
kept sewing. 

Q: Sewing. 

A: She ended up becomi ng an expert at sewing ti
es and it was piecework, so she worked very 
hard. And I arrived in Ne w York, and the firs
t few months I prepared for my final exam. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And then I looked for a job and I couldn™t 
find any because when -- for good -- there was a 
shortage of good jobs. I didn™t know
 whether I had yet received my
 Bachelor™s degree, because 
the papers went through Britain by 
boat and the results were not i
n. And -- and my sister worked 
as an intern in a hospital, but she wasn™t ma
king much mone y either, and -- and when I -- it was 
a me nial job they thought I was too well educated, 
they didn't want to give me  a me ni al job. So 
in the meanwhile, when I was in London I had app
lied for college in Amer
ica, not knowing I was 
going to get the degree from London, 
and a fre -- friend suggested that I apply to MIT and I got 
admitted, but I didn™t have money to go and some kind person in New York -- the Jewish fa mily 
service send me  to some body and he lend me  some
 money and I went then to MIT. And when I 
arrived at MI T, I was told that si nce I didn™
t have yet my Bachelor™s degree, because  in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
79 
 
September it wasn™t yet known whether I had passe
d in June or not, believe it or not and they 
said it depended how well I passed before they co
uld admit me to graduate school. A -- th -- and 
I didn™t want to become  an undergraduate beca
use I thought I™d passed, so they ma de me  a 
special student. And there was a bit of a di
saster because special student  can™t get the 
scholarship. 
Q: Oh.  

A: So -- and there is an or gani
zation in Boston called -- at that 
time there was an organization in 
Boston on Mount Auburn Street where they were he
lping Jewish immi gr ants and they gave me  a 
loan and I also got a job at -- pa
rt-time job at MIT, so I finish
ed for a few months as special 
student, then my matriculation results -- my Bach
elor™s degree results arrived and they admitted 
me  to graduate school, so -- 

Q: Uh-huh. And then you got your -- 

A: And then I became an assist ant [indecipherable] the scholarship, yeah. 
Q: And wha t  degree did you get from MIT? 
A: I got a Master™s degree in
 electrical engineering, yeah. 
Q: [indecipherable]. And then you went to Harvard for Ph.D.? 

A: Then I went to work for Li
ncoln Laboratory, which was located 
in those days at MIT. And I 
got admitted at Harvar d for a Ph.D., and I wa
s commuting -- working -- I was both working at  

Lincoln Laboratory, going to Harvard, it was sligh
tly illega l because you™re not supposed to be a 
full-time  e mployee when you are -- 

Q: A student. 

A: -- when you™re a full-time student. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
80 
 
A: So I used to pick my classes early in the 
morning or on Saturdays, 
or -- or at lunch hour. 
Q: I see. 
A: But -- and then I got the scholarship from Harvard, and I transf
erred there --  went full-time. 
Q: And wha t  happened to your sister?  She got a 
degree in medicine, but 
certainly she couldn™t 
just use it in the United St ates, she w
ould have to take another exam, yes? 
A: Ah, right, she, I believe, did take another exam
. But my sister then -- my sister had been in 
love with some body in Beirut who was her instruct
or, actually, he was prof
essor of medicine and 
he came to New York, and they got ma
rried, and she went back to Beirut. 
Q: She went back to Beirut? 

A: Right. 

Q: Oh my. And she remained there? 

A: And she remained there, and was -- I -- when 
we got ma rried we went to visit her and then 
when the fighting broke out in Lebanon she came 
for a short time  to New York and then she 
went back, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Is she still alive? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No.  

Q: I was thinking about your parents and in a 
way, while your life chan
ged drastically, or you 
have to go through a number of changes, all of 
this happened when you were very young and in a 
for mative state, whereas your parents lost everything -- 

A: Exactly. 

Q: -- that they had. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
81 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: And they were never able to recoup that. 

A: Right. 

Q: Is that right? 

A: That™s right, yes. It was very difficult for them. 

Q: For them. 

A: Yes. Particularly for my father, yeah. 

Q: Because he never acquired the st
atus that he ha d [indecipherable] 
A: Right, mm-hm. But they never complained. 

Q: They didn™t? 

A: No. They felt very lucky th
at their lives were saved -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and their children went 
to school and were alive. 
Q: Right. Do you think of yourself as a survivor? 

A: I th-think of myself more as
 a refugee than as a survivor . 
I can™t compare myself to people 
who were in camps.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I was very lucky, yes, being able to reconstruct my life and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- to come unscathed from the war. 

Q: Is there anything that you™d lik
e to talk about that we have
n™t spoken about at this point? 
A: I -- I think -- 

Q: You think it™s [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
82 
 
A: Yeah, pretty good stor
y of my life, yes. 
Q: We ll, I want to thank you very mu ch 
for your agreeing to tell us your story. 
A: We ll, thank you. 

Q: It™s been really qui
te fascinating, thank you. 
A: Thank you.  

Q: And we™ll shut the came raoff and then do your photographs. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
83 
 
Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Julian, tell -- tell me a littl
e bit about what you did once y
ou got your degrees from Harvard 
and MIT. What work did you do all these years? 
A: I was mo stly in -- I became a specialist in 
communication theory and signal pr ocessing and I 
first worked on development of rada r and then 
on development of visual communications or 
radio communications in particular
. And I first worked at Lincol
n Laboratory, and then I worked 
at RCA and then I started my own c o mpany.  

Q: How -- how did you happen to narrow the field?  I 
-- I™m assumi ng this is -- 
is part of the field 
of electrical engine
ering, am I right? 
A: Correct, yes. 

Q: And if that™s the case, how
 do you -- how did you narrow it down to these particular aspects? 

A: I looked for the most mathe matical
 part of electrical engineering. 
Q: Really? 
A: And that turned out to be
 signal processing and what™s ca
lled statistical communication 
theory. 
Q: Uh-huh. But this led you also to work 
a great deal with the military, I gather? 
A: Right, I worked quite a bit military resear
ch and development and wi th NASA. And very 
proud I contributed to the first landing on the mo on 
because I assisted in the selection of radars 
for them, and testing them for -- for the landing on the moon. 

Q: Really?  So were -- were you there 
when -- when the lift-off happened? 
A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: No, I was not there, I wa
tched it on televisions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
84 
 
Q: On television like the rest of us. 
A: And I was very excited. 

Q: I bet you were. And you worked for how
 long?  When did you retire?  Just -- 
A: I retired formerly in 1987. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But I continue still consulting. 

Q: You do? 

A: Yes. And I occasionally write something and I 
just recently wrote a chapter for encyclopedial 
telecommunications. 

Q: I see. Wh en -- when you look back on yourlife, do you see that your experiences had an 

important influence on how you lived your life after the war? 

A: Definitely, yes. 

Q: An-And how would 
you characterize that? 
A: Well, fi rst of all, having served in the milita
ry and having had ups and downs in my own life, 
I learned that money is very valuable, but that yo
u really -- well, it™s more important that you feel 
good and do the right thing. And -- and I learned to 
respect people in every 
walk of life. And -- 
and some times I found different people helped me  in different situations a
nd some of them were 
not my buddies, and -- and also I 
learned to not give up easily and to
 have faith that I can get out 
of a situation, and if it wa s difficult for example, in
 business, I learned to pe
rsist and -- and try to 
find a way to solve problems. And I kind of got 
-- I get very challenged to -- when I™m in 
adversity, to deal with it. And I 
think I™ve taught my children that. 
Q: And how do you relate that to the -- do 
you think -- well, I don™t 
know how -- whether you 
can even answer this question. Had you not escaped, had your not -- not 
-- your parents shown 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
85 
 
you that there are other ways to 
handle things, it mi ght have been
 easier to become  de pressed, or 
-- or not have such a hopeful outlook. 
A: Well, I actually am determined not to become depressed. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my mother at one point 
became  depressed and I felt s-so mi serable about it, and saw her 
so mi serable that I decided -- 

Q: That you wouldn™t. [indecipherable] 

A: I will not let myself become  depressed, unde
r any circumstances. A
nd I -- I -- I kind of 
someti mes welcomed the challenge. I -- I don™t regard
 it as adversity, I regard
 it as some thing to 
overcome, when there is a problem. 

Q: And I understand that you are 
very involved in Polish Jewi sh
 relations and involved with 
those Poles with -- who were not Jewish neces
sarily, who went though similar experiences to 
you. [indecipherable] 
A: That™s right. I -- I -- I feel
 that the people who went throug
h it, we really had all very good 
relations. Now, this was not true of survivors, 
some  of whom are very bitter that some  their 
friends denounced them. And on the other hand th
ere are people who survived who were saved 
by Poles. It was almost impossible to survive 
without some  assistance from some body. But I™m 
interested in seeing Polish Jewish relations b
ecome nor mal, and -- and th
is is impossible unless 
you participate and try to do it, 
y-you can™t just say I won™t ha
ve anything to do with these 
people and hope that relations can become  nor ma
lized. And I believe it™s important that people 
get along no matter what nationali
ty they are, and what ethnic 
group they are and what religion 
they are.  

Q: And do you see improveme nts in the relati
onship of Polish Jews and Polish Gentiles? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
86 
 
A: I see improveme nts particularly among e
ducated people and we are amazed when we 
some ti me s go to Poland, in recent years we have g
one to Poland almost ev
ery year, that there are 
some  people who become very inte
rested in -- in Jewish histor y 
and contribution of Jews. Jews 
who are 10 percent of Poland. And I think some  of
 it has been the German propaganda that sort 
of separated Jews into umensch, whi c h means, not a ma n, inhuma ns basically. 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- and also Soviet propaganda which was 
against Palestine, and 
against Zi onism, and -- 
and some  of this is the Soviet and German inf -- a-and, you know, the Germans have become  

democratic country now, and -- 
and Communism is dead and so
me  of it is disappearing in 
Poland, but there is still, particularly among peop
le who are de prived, who look to be either 
better than some body, or to be mean to some
body and compe nsate for their depravation, no 
ma tter whether the person is guilty of their deprava
tion or not. And some of these people are still 
sort of anti-Semitic -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- but the more intelligent pe
ople are not, I don™
t think. And so I am a c tiv
e in -- in -- both in 
trying to document Polish Jewish hist
ory and in Polish Jewish relations. 
Q: Relations. And tell me  when you me t your wife. 

A: I met my wife around -- I™m not very 
good at dates, but I think it was around 1958. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And -- and I was already working and my wife  
was still a student and she -- and I met her at a 
party, and at first she wasn™t inte
rested in me , but then one day I 
arranged to meet her finally, and 
she asked me some  questions about my past and she became interested and -- and then our 

roma nce wa s partly my telling he
r the story of my life 
and then it turn out her father had been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
87 
 
from Poland himself, and he came here just be
fore the World War I, 
and she was listening to 
what I had to say and gradually our friendship grew. 
Q: And whe n did you get ma rried? 

A: We  got ma rried in 1960. 

Q: Oh good, you reme mbered that. 

A: It™s a -- that™s one easy -- beca
use it ends in zero, that™s an -- 
Q: That™s an -- it™s an 
easy date [indecipherable] 
A: -- easy date, yes. And it was really, I think 
a very fortunate experience for me , and -- 
Q: And you have three children? 

A: We  had three children, two girls and one s
on and our daughters are 38 and 35 now and our 
son is 33. And we have done a lot of fa mily trav
eling, yeah. We went to Poland and actually to 

Ukraine with the children, so -- in 1989, when 
the Iron Curtain dropped. I had been afraid to go 
to Poland before I retired because I was working 
in defense industry, but then after I retired and 
Gorbachev came  to powe r  or some thing, we decided to go and visit Lwów. 
Q: And you went as a family? 

A: And we went as a family to show them. Actu
ally, my -- I didn™t want to go at first, but my 
wife insisted, so we -- 

Q: Right. And you have eight grandchildren? 

A: We  have eight gran-grandchildren, yes.  

Q: Well, I think what I™d like us to do, we™ll st op the camera. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: And I thank you, and we™re going to look at some  photographs -- 

A: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
88 
 
Q: -- so that people can 
see part of your life -- 
A: Okay. 
Q: -- in photographs. 

A: So we going to change seats? 

Q: Yes.  

Q: And who is this gentlema n here? 

A: This is my grandfather, his name  was Joach
im Philip. And actually in the birth certificate he 
is listed as Chaim Car me n Philip. And he is a 
very dapper gentlema n in
 a bowler hat and with 
nice gold chain and a cane in his 
hand and stiff, white collar. 
Q: And this is your mother™s father? 

A: My mother™s father. 

Q: Okay. 

A: He was in real estate business. 
Q: And who  is this? 
A: This is a fa mily photo of Joseph Bussgang, and 
Stefania Bussgang, my father and mother with 
myself, Julian and with my mother
 and my sister Janina, or Ja
nine. And my father was very 
proud because he had gone on a trip to Amst
erdam and bought those ma tching outfits for my 

sister and myself.  

Q: And who is this good looking lad? 

A: This is myself, Julian Bussgang as a young boy, 
and I am with a -- in 
a sailor kind of unifor m, 
which was a school uniform in the school 
I attended during my element a ry school. 
Q: And about how old do you think you are? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
89 
 
A: I think -- I wrote it in the b
ack. I think I tried to reconstruct 
it. I-I-It™s on the back of the 
picture. I think I am -- 
Q: Eight. That™s what it says. 

A: -- I think I™m eight, 
yeah. Eight or nine.  
Q: Okay. 

A: This is a photograph of my mother who is in 
mourning, that™s why she™s 
dressed in black with 
a veil. And her mother had passed away. And it™s my
self, Jul i an and my sister Janine in Krynice, 
which is a Polish sort of resort spa where ther
e is -- famous for its good mi neral water, and we 
are holding glasses with 
glass straws to drink 
this special  water.  
Q: And this one?   

A: This is my father, Joseph Bussgang, also in 
Krynice, walking al -- alon
g the street, which is 
kind of like a park and he carries an umbrella 
and has a rain cap on and 
he has got breeches on. 
This is his infor mal sports outfit. And he came to
 visit us because my mother and we  used to go 
on vacation and my father would come  and visit us for a few days and go back to work. 

Q: And this? 

A: This is my mother, Stefania Bussgang, and 
it™s a photograph that sh
e took for a passport, I 
think, and it ma y have be en taken just be
fore we went to Palestine, I think. 

Q: And whe n was this taken, do you think? 

A: I think this was taken 1938, just before 
the war, when I was a high school student. 
Q: You™re very serious. 

A: I look very serious, yes.  

Q: And this one? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0473  
90
