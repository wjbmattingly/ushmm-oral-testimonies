The Germ ans  invaded Poland on Septem ber
 
1, 1939. By 1942, at the age of 13, Henr y was  
s ent with his  fam ily to do for c ed labor in a m unitions  factor y. He was  deported to Buna

Monowitz and the s ec ond to Flos s enburg.
 
 
At age 17, Henry was  liberated and one year  later  he em igr ated to the United
 
States.
 
         
  
Henry, who lives in the Washington, D.C. ar ea, los t his wife, Shirley, in 2011, after  nearly 64 
years of marriage
. 
Henr y and Shir ley had four c hildren, thr ee s ons  and one daughter, who have

pr ovided 12 grandc hildr en. And now ther e are s
ix great gr andc hildren, r anging fr om 2 ½ to 6 years  old, 
with a s eventh due in J anuary. Henr y notes that all but one are gir ls
. 
                                       
 
 
Henry retired from his  dry c leaning bus ines s  19 year s  ago and has  been as s oc iated with

In August 2014, Henr y took  his  three s ons to Germ any and Poland, at the inv itation of the C

When we first began Fir st Pers on in Marc h 2000, our  very first Firs t Pers on was  Henry
. 
With 
that, I would like you to join me in welc oming our Firs t Per s on, Henr y Gr eenbaum .

[Cheer s and Applaus e]
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Good.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us and for  your willingnes s to be our
 
Firs t Per s on
 
today.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  You'r e welc o
m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  17 years you've been with us .
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  That's r ight.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All right, Henr y. You have s o m uc h to s har e with us  in a shor t hour s o we will s tart r ight 

away. You wer e 11 years  old when Germ any invaded Poland. Before we tur n to the war  and the 
Holoc aus t, tell us  a little bit about your fam ily, your  c omm unity, and you in the year s  before the war 

began.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Like you s aid, we had a lar ge fam ily, nine c hildr en. We had s ix gir ls and thr ee 

boys . And we r an
 
a tailor s hop, a s m all bus ines s. We made a living. We wer e not r ic h.We made an 
hones t living.We got along with our  neighbors. Mos t of our  c us tomers  wer e non
-
J ewis h. We s er ved 
tailoring, either  new garments or repair ing, mostly.
 
 
Me, as  a youngster
 
--
 
ev
er ybody had a c hor e in the hous e. If I didn't go to s c hool
 
--
 
after 
s c hool I had to keep the ir on hot s o they c ould iron the s tuff that they fixed. In thos e days  we didn't 

have any elec tric  ir ons . They had an ir on that had a hollow ins ide. You had either  coal or s omething 
was  in ther e and I had to get it started s o it will keep going
. l
ike a gr ill
, so
 
they c ould us e the ir on.
 
Mos t of the time I played s oc c er with m y neighbors , with no
n-
J ewis h, J ewis h kids with non
-J
ewis h k ids. 
We'd have skirm is hes lik e every where els e you a game; everybody wants  to win. Some los e. Some 

days  you win.
 
But nevertheles s , we got along pr etty good. 
 
 
We wer e very r eligious  at hom e. We lived near the s ynagogue
, f
ive doors  away. My father  
was  the c ar etaker of the s ynagogue. He c los ed and opened the s ynagogue ever y day. And then, of 
c our se, he ran the s hop that we had.
 
 
One brother , Zachery, he was  in the Polis h Army. And then David, he was  s till with us , hom e. 
Him and m y father both ran the s hop. The gir ls , they wer e m es s ing around with ladies ' c lothes. 
Sometimes they would come in, ladies ' clothes , and they would do that, too.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bes ides your brother  who was  in the Arm y, one of your  s ister s had left home as  well, 

had gone to the United States ?
 
>>
 
Henr y Greenbaum:  She c am e here in 1937. She c ame her e. My father had two br others and a 
s is ter who c am e her e in 1905, s omething ar ound that time. They settled in New Yor k . But the 

imm igr ation laws  wer e s o tough here they wouldn't just let you in. Nowadays  people jus t cr os s  the 

3 
 
bor der, they'r e here whether  you like it or  not like it. In thos e days  you had to go through years, 
s om etimes  a whole year , till you pas s ed. You're luc ky if you c am e through the c ounc il, well, next year , 
next year.
 
 
My oldes t br other  tried for  year s . I don't know why  they didn't let him in. He was a m aster 
tailor. He wouldn't be on the gover nm ent's  payr oll. He would c ontr ibute. He would be paying taxes , 
m aking m oney and paying his  taxes . But they s omehow didn't let him in but my s is t
er had no tr ouble. 
She c am e as  a young lady. I don't rem em ber how old s he was  when she c ame, s ingle. She c am e to 
one of the unc les . The uncle had c hildr en of their own. One of them  m oved fr om New York , c ame to 
Washington. And he s ettled in Was hington. And that's the one that br ought my s is ter down her e in 
1937.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, your  father  died before the war  began, right befor e the war began, a c ouple of 
m onths, I think. How did the family m ake ends  m eet dur ing that tim e s inc e he had the tailoring 
b
us ines s ?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Well, it was n't that eas y. It was  tough. But my mother  was  wor rying her s elf to 

death how you m ake a living. You know
,  
the m oms  ar e always  worr ied about how are we going to 
m ake a living, how are we going to eat.We were never s hor t on food.We always  had food.
 
 
My oldes t br other , he ran away later  on.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll c om e back  to that.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Oh, ok.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  September
 
1, 1939, Germany invades  Poland. You wer e quickly oc c upied. Tell us 
what it was  like in thos e firs t days  when the Germans  c ame in and what life was  like befor e you wer e 

for c ed into a ghetto.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  I was  jus t a youngster. I cared les s about the war . I was  m or e interested in
 
--
 
I 
was  more inter ested in playing s oc c er with other people, with other boys, or  other games. Cared less  

about the war . The par ents  were ther e with their  s m all radio, like 10
-
by
-
10 r adio lis tening to the war .
 
My father, before he pass ed away, he got us  jobs in the ammunition factory. There were rumor s  
c oming 
ar ound what did the Nazis  like and dis like when they take over a c ity. They liked when you wor ked in a 
fac tor y. They c ould c are les s  about tailoring. But later on they needed tailor ing. So we wer e s till in 

bus ines s .
 
 
Luc kily one of our c lients, one of our c ustomer s , happened to be a manager  in a m unition 
fac tor y. So my father hear d all of thes e r um ors  on the r adio and he s aid, 
W
hy don't I approac h that guy 
who c ame in
? 
He knew he was wor king in the fac tory but he didn't know what c apac ity. Was he a 
m
anager, an owner , whatever ?
 
 
So he ap
pr oac hed him . He s aid, ﬁ C
an you give m y k ids a job in the fac tor y
?ﬂ  
No hes itation. He 
says, 
ﬁH
ow many do you have
?ﬂ  
He s ays , 
ﬁT
he thr ee gir ls  and this  young boy.
ﬂ  
And one of the girls was  
alr eady
 
--
 
the one we showed on
 
the s cr een with the little gir l, Faige. Her hus band was  alr eady in 
Am eric a. She didn't live with us  when s he was  marr ied but as s oon as  he left for Am er ic a, s he m oved in 

with us . So grandm a took  over with the little gir l so she c ould go to the factory and
 
work. And we had 
I.D.s . So all four  of us  wer e s afe, s o to s peak. We had I.D.s that we wor ked in factory
 b
efor e they c ame 
in the Germ ans, oc c upied our c ity. Then two weeks later  m y father  pas s ed away. And then all of a 

s udden the war  was  alr eady c oming c los er to our city. Eventually it was  taken over  to our city.
 
 
My m om  was  ver y protective after m y father  pas sed away, es pec ially with the gir ls. You c an't 
go nowher e. You have to s tay r ight her e with m e. You c an't get in tr ouble no plac e.
 
So what happened
? 
The next door neighbor had a hors e and buggy. That's the only trans por tation we had, no c ars  in the 

c ity, I don't think, except a bus  taking you out of town and br inging you bac k  to town. Bic yc les , 

m otorc yc les , and hors e and buggies .
 
 
Any way
, s he asked hi
m to take us to 
a farm er that we knew. How s he
 
--
 
ther e wer e no 
telephones . How did they ar range
d 
that, I don't rem em ber . But all I know is  the hor s e and buggy took  
m e, m y mom, m y oldes t of the brothers , bec aus e the other brother, Zac hery, was  in the Army, in the 

Polis h Arm y. And they took us  to the far m 10
 
m iles  away s o nobody would get hurt when the
y tak e over 
the c ity. They us ually throw bombs and s he didn't want anybody to get hurt.
 

4 
 
 
So we went to that farm. We stayed in that farm  for  three days . We heard all the 
bom bar dment
s  c oming in bec aus e 10
 
m iles  away was  not that far  away. On the sec ond day m y br other 
and I, David, he was  out there with me eating break fas t outside. The farmer, the owner of the far m, 
gave us  a s lic e of bread, butter  on it, and s ays , go out and take a tom ato off the vine. It was late 
Septem ber, ther e were still tom atoes  on the vine. And we ate tom atoes  and bread.We wer e s uppos ed 
to go in and get a glas s of m ilk  after that.
 
 
While we wer e eating, we s aw fr om  a dis tanc e, a gray uniform  approac hing us . We c ould not 
figure out who this was  at all. As we got c los er together, it was  a Polis h s oldier , not Jewis h. He had a lot 

of medals  on him . He was not a pr ivate. It s o happened that m y brother David knew him  by first name. 
They kept talking to eac h other  like friends. They either went to s chool together or he was  just a 
c us tom er in our plac e. I don't r em ember . But all I know is  that he asked the s oldier , 
ﬁW
her e ar e you 
r unning away fr om
?ﬂ 
He s ays, 
ﬁ
I'm running fr om  the Ger m an Arm y. They're her e thr ee kilom eter s and 
they're c oming this  way.
ﬂ  
 
The Polis h s oldier  was  running in the opposite dir ec tion away. My br other had an idea, whic h I 
c ould not believe m ys elf what I heard. He s ays , 
ﬁI
s  it ok  if I run away with y ou
?ﬂ  
I s aid, 
ﬁN
o
!ﬂ  H
ow do 
you do that
? 
You'r e my oldes t brother. You'r e s uppos ed to be my pr otec tor. My father pas s ed away 
al
r eady. He's  suppos ed to be the protector. This  is  my br other. 
 
 
He t
ook  off with the s oldier but I didn't let him get away too far. I followed him
,  
hiding behind 
bus hes . I thought maybe he'll change his  mind. I didn't want to go back  in ther e with the gir ls and then 
am  I going to be their pr otec tor?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At 11 year s  old.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Yeah. I was  too young. Any way, ever y tim e he s aw me, lifting my head over  the 
fenc e, over  the bus hes, "Go back  to your mother," "Go back  to your  m other." Of
 
c our s e I didn't lis ten to 
him . I was  angr y at him, why he's  going to leave me her e. I thought m aybe m y older brother, s uppos ed 
to pr otect your little brother. But he didn't do that. Till the Polis h s oldier turned ar ound and yelled, 
"You're too young" in Polis h, "You'r e too young. You go back  to your  m other ." I s aid ok . They didn't 
want m e. 
 
 
So I went back to my mom  and told her the bad news . Of c ours e she was  ver y ups et, crying. 
How ar e we going to m ake a living
? 
That's what she was  worr ying about.
 
The gi
r ls  c alm ed her down, 
oh, we'll help
; d
on't wor ry about it. You'll be ok. And the thir d day we all pac ked up and went back  to 
our  town. 
 
 
I never s aw a Germ an soldier yet, until I c am e to my town. In my town, when we pas s ed the 
m arketplac e on the way to m y hous e, I s aw there was  nine or  10 people hung fr om the town. They 
hung them , whoever  oc c upied, the Nazis  oc c upied the town. They took  all the doctor s, the lawyer s , 
what we in thos e days  called intelligents ia. They wer e getting the lawyers , the doc tors, and
 
they hung 
them. Maybe s om e Communis ts, too. I don't know that but all I know is  at that age, I had to witnes s  10 

people, nine or 10 people hanging. Next to m y father, that's the fir s t time I ever  s aw a dead but hanging 
I never s aw that. It was  on m y mind c onstantly why they would do s om ething like that.
 
Mom explained 
that's  what happened. They took  the smart people. They didn't want them to interfere with the 
oc c upanc y, I gues s.
 
 
And we went to bus ines s.We opened the door, c leaned up. Ever y tim e I would h
ear the boots 
c lic king on the s idewalk, I would r un towar d the door , thr ough a c r ack, just to lis ten, to obs er ve the 
s oldier . What does  the soldier look  like
? 
Why am I s o s c ar ed of them
? 
They didn't do anything to me 
yet.
 
 
I looked. He was  s c ar y looking. Always  wearing a helm et bec aus e they just oc c upied the c ity 
three days  ago. So they all wore helmets , boots, and their r ifles. They all walked ar ound with that 
c ons tantly.
 
Then I went bac k  after I obs erved them. Like I s aid, he didn't do anything to me. 
 
 B
ut later on, a c ouple of weeks , the order c ame out. All the J ews  in that town had to wear  the 
yellow Star of David. So from  a c hild on to no matter how old you wer e, you had to wear  a yellow s tar 
on the front and in the bac k . That m eans if you walked on the sidewalk, anytime you met with a s oldier, 

any r ank  of s oldier , German s oldier, you had to s tep off.We were never bareheaded, bec ause we wer e 

5 
 
r eligious . Always  had the hat on, the tas s els  sticking out. And then we walked on the s idewalk. And 
ever y tim e you s ee the soldier, tak e your  hat off, jump off the s idewalk, and let the master, s o to s peak , 
walk thr ough. You have to give them attention to that. If you didn't obey, he would kick you off, knock  
you down with the r ifle butt on the s idewalk and thr eaten
 
kick you off the sidewalk, on the r oad. It was  
not dangerous , the r oad, didn't have any c ar s to wor ry about.
 

 
But anyway, that was  
the 
first thing they intr oduced us  to. And then the second thing, later, 
they left us  in the s tr eet bec aus e we wer e already identified with the Star  of David. The truck would pull 
up on the s idewalk. If they s aw you with a star, they grabbed you on the truc k .
 
 
What did we 
do
 
on the truc k
? 
The tr uck was  full. They went to the c ountr ys ide, to the 
farm lands , and we had to dig trenc hes for  them. They s aid for m ilitary tanks to fall in. It turned out to be 
graves  later. They told us  it was  trenc hes for  tank s  to fall in.
 
Whatever  work  they had to do, they 
grabbed us in the str eet. Clean the vehic les . Clean the plac e where they lived. Where they took over  
plac es .
 
 
It so happened when they grabbed me one time and I s aid, "I work  in the fac tories. Her e's m y 
I.D." never be without the I.D. It's like a pass port. You had to wear  the I.D. You had to hide it in the 
poc ket. "Well, you're not due until 3:00
 
in the afternoon. This is 10:00. You c an work  for  us and later we 
will dr op you off in the factory" and they did that. That day I did double s hift.What type of people did the 

s am e thing
? 
They gr abbed them  even tho
ugh they had I.D.s . They took
 
them  to dig the trenc hes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, it wouldn't be very long before you and your  family and the other J ews  in your 
c om m unity were for c ed into a ghetto. Tell us  about the ghetto and what conditions  were like for you 
ther e.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:
  
Well, we didn't have to move. That's one thing about the ghetto.We s tayed in 
our  little hous e. They took  over  the neighborhood.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where your  hous e already was .
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Yes . They took  over  our  neighborhood, thr ee
-
block  per imet
er, s m all little block . 
Mos t of them was  near the ar ea wher e the s ynagogue was , m ost of the r eligious  J ews  were there. They 
didn't m ake a fenc e. They jus t barbed wir e us  ar ound, three
-
block c irc le around. They put two guards , a 
Ukrainian who joined the Nazi r egim e, and als o a SS guy. And they were the guards. You c ould not 
walk out of this  area at all unles s  you wer e on the way to the factory. You showed them the I.D., they let 
you go to work. Ther e was  nowher e to s top, anyway. The s tores  were looted. The k os her s tor es  wer e 
looted. Ever ything was  tur ned ups ide down. It was  a mes s on the outs ide. So ther e was  nowher e to go 
any way.
 
The only way y ou c ould c ome out, like I s aid, you had an I.D. We s tayed in that ghetto. The 
only thing is  the family was intact, together. Everybody was  in one plac e. No one was  hur t. Nobody got 
hur t.We all lived in ther e.
 
 
Then they found out that the more J ews  lived in the area but they wer e not aware. So they got 
the c ity polic e to s how them  where the other J ewis h fam ilies  lived.
 
They drove up with the tr uck . That's 
for m y s is ter  telling us . They did not knock  lightly, exc us e m e, you have to c ome out. They alm ost 

bus ted the door  down with the r ifle butt, just c haos. A lot of sc r eam ing,

Faige's little gir l, she was  taken care 
of. She gr abbed her . No, one of the other s is ter s grabbed

Rozia. So s he grabbed them  and br ought 
them over  to us. We had to put them  up in a small hous e. No m atter wher e they wer e sleeping, on 
bunks, on c hairs, on floor . But we put up. There we s tayed until all the J ews  wer e in one area, 
three

block per imeter .
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  the food c onditions lik e for you?
 

> > Henr y Greenbaum:  The food c onditions , we had leftovers what we had lived off for a while. That 

depleted its elf. Then we had to depend on the Ger man Army to bring our food in. So they would br ing in 
r ations . All of a s udden they s topped giving us s oap to keep c lean. That's  the fir st thing they took  away, 
the s oap. Th
er e was  no hair c uts given to us nor to the wom en. Everybody  had long hair while we were 
ther e.
 
 
We stayed together fr om October to

we s tayed from 1940 to Oc tober
 
1942.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Almos t thr ee years .
 

6 
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Two year s  I think .We stayed in that ghetto. The only thing is, the fam ily was  
intac t, together . Dir ty as  we wer e, hungr y as we wer e, but nevertheles s  the family was  intac t, together. 
So that was  a helping.
 
 
All of a s udden that day Oc tober
 
1942 they wouldn't let us go to work  for  24 hours 
--
 
bec aus e 
we had differ ent s hifts, 7:00
 
to 3:00, 3:00
 
to 11:00, 11:00
 
to 7:00
 
in the m orning. So they wouldn't let us  
go to work . They brought in the extra s oldier s , extr a dogs. They c has ed us out of the ghetto area. They 
m ade s ure nobody was  left
 
in there. They c hecked everything. Ever y hous e was  c hecked. Ever ybody 
was  at the marketplac e, went over ther e. 
 
 
And r ight there the s elections  s tar ted.
T
he s elec tions  s tar ted. Uniform ed guys  were s itting and 
dir ec ting traffic . You walk ed up as a family. My fam ily, m y m om , m ys elf with the three s isters. The older 

br other es c aped alr eady. So we s howed him  the I.D. All of us went over  to one s ide, to the good s ide.
 
Then the other s , my mom and their m arr ied s is ter s  went over. They s ent them  over  to the oppos i
te 
dir ec tion bec aus e of their  c hildr en. My mom was  only 54, c ons ider ed too old, I gues s, to work.
 
 
So we wer e s eparated at the end of the day. The worker s
 
--
 
and als o they s aved able
-
bodied 
people. If you didn't have the I.D., you s till wer e saved if you wer e not attac hed with any c hildren, 

pr egnant. They took  away all the pregnant women, wom en with childr en who jus t gave c hildbir th, 
handic apped people, older  people. They separated us .
 
 
They took  thos e people away. We didn't know wher e they took them until 
after the war. 
Bec aus e we were luc ky through the r es t of the war . They s aid they were taken to a plac e c alled 

Treblinka, nothing but a killing c enter. They s aid they pr obably wer e killed two days  later  after  they wer e 
pic ked up. It was  nothing but a killin
g c enter
. T
hat's  wher e m y m om went, m y m arried s ister s, three little 
niec es  and two nephews. I never  saw them again.We were looking for  them . Would travel in differ ent 

c am ps. I remem ber going to a p
lac e called 
B er gen
-
Bels en. It was  of c our se
 
by the Br itis
h. The Britis h 
s oldier s  told us  we c ould only s tay thr ee days  then we had to go back  to wher e we lived. Go back  to our 
c ity.
 
 
So then I s aid only need one day. While I was  looking around in ther e, I r an into a firs t c ous in, 
Ita
. She helped m e a great deal. I'm jumping ahead.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  ok . I'll bring you back.
 
 
In Oc tober
 
1942 you lost your  mother and your marr ied s isters and niec e and nephews .
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were left then with a c ouple of your  s isters, three, I believe. What happened?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  We wer e c has ed. After  they s epar ated us , they took  them away from  us. I'll 
never forget. My mom wanted to c om e and give m e a little hug. I was  a little baby. I was  the younges t 

of the family. They would not 
let her. They kept pus hing her back with the rifle butt. And I didn't like 
what I s aw. But what c ould I do
? 
I don't have a gun. Find a Goliath s o big and tall with the r ifles  and 
their helmets, boots. So I c ould not help it. She yelled over to m y s is ters , 
"Take c are of your  little 
br other." That was  the las t time I s aw her .
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did they do with you then?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  They tur ned ar ound to us , c has ed us for  s ix kilometer s  uphill
; l
iter ally c hasing 
us  with the dogs  and whips .
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  You wer e r unning with your sis ters  while they're c has ing you? 
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  With my s is ters , yes , three.We wer e all we had. Running with them. And then 
we thought we were going to go back  into the ghetto. They c has ed us  pas sed the ghetto
, uphill s ix 
kilometers. Ther e was  a big s ur pris e. A big s lave labor  c amp with s ix
-
foot fences , towers , dogs , s earc h 
lights. They were r ight ther e. A s lave labor  c amp built for us. We no longer c ould go back to the ghetto. 
Whatever you left in the ghetto stayed in the ghetto. You c ould not retr ieve anything. So if you left 
s om ething valuable, s omebody els e got it I gues s.
 
 
Then they put us in. A little blanket r olled up. One guy was  at the
 
--
 
I c an't rem ember
 
--
 
the 
bar racks. I c ouldn't think  of the bar rack
s . The first time I s aw a barr ack, on s tilts . A lot of barracks were 
built for us. The one s oldier  was  at the barr ack , one s oldier  was  at the gate. They gave eac h other 

7 
 
s ignals . If c apac ity was  full, they give a s ignal and went to another  barr ack . Separ ate
 
the m en from the 
women.
 
 
We walked into the bar rac k . Believe m e, we looked at three s helves , bunk s.Where's  the 
m attress? 
Where's  str aw
? 
Nothing. J us t a plain wooden s helf. They put 75
-
inc hes  wide, thr ee guys  had 
to s leep together, wide. The little blanket they gave us , we us ed it as  a pillow so our head c ould res t at 
leas t.
 
And then at nighttim e, unr estful. You never  c ould s leep on your back . J ust on the s ide. We stayed 
ther e for  another year.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  the wor k  that you were made to do?
 
>
>  Henry Gr eenbaum:  Munitions  fac tor y. Then one of m y s is ter s volunteered to bec ome a tailor, Faige. 
She was  with the tailors. 100 tailor s, m en and wom en, wor king on the Germ an uniforms  for the 

high
-
r anking offic ers .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And it was  in this c amp where you los t your s is ter s . Right?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Well, from the day that we c arried over the dirt, filth, from the ghetto to the s lave 
labor  c amp bec aus e they took  away the s oap. They didn't give us  any s oap in the slave labor  c am p 
either . They h
ad a pump with water  outs ide. So in the s umm er tim e, we would undres s. A man could 
undr es s  from the wais t on up. You
 
didn't have s oap. You took  the dirt from  the ground, put it all over  
your s elf like a m ud bath. The next pum ped the water.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Us ing the dirt and mud.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Yes . But that did not kill the lic e.We wer e lic e
-
infes ted from the dirt and filth. 
The c lothes we were wearing was  alr eady thr ee years  old.When did you c hange
? 
We did not c hange. 
So we becom e m or e lic e infes te
d. 
 
 
And then the Typhoid epidem ic  br ok e out. Very c ontagious  s icknes s.When you s leep in suc h 
c los e quarters, if one c atc hes  it, the next is guar anteed.
 
And then they did not want to wai
t 10 days  until 
you get over it.
 
So what they did is  if you didn't
 
--
 
ever y m or ning we had a lineup in the front of the 
bar rack . They knew the barr ack  held m aybe 100 people. People were miss ing. Well, the firs t thing, they 

let the dogs go underneath the ba
rrack, 
under the s tilts, under the barr ack. If they didn't pull anybo
dy 
out, nobody hiding. But they went ins ide the barrac k  and s ome people c ouldn't get off the bunk  

bec aus e they had high fever with the Typhoid. It was  impos s ible for you to s tand on your feet. No way 

you c ould s tand on your feet.
 
 
So what they
 
--
 
I think  i
t was  the gr oup, Eins tazgruppen. The tr uck  was  full with the s ick  
people. We thought they'r e going to give them  s om e help, tak e them to a doc tor or get them s om e 
m edic ine or at leas t take them away from us . But they took  them over  to the plac e where we dug
 
thos e 
tr enc hes that they s uppos edly told us  wer e for  the militar y tank s  to be falling in. But all of thos e people 
that would c om e down with the Typhoid, had to com e in fr ont of the ditc h, undres s , naked, and they 
were s hot in the back of the head and ins ide they went. The ditc h was  full. They went to the next one. 
We dug three m onths  of thos e. I don't r em em ber  how m any, the gr aves , how m any we dug but quite a 
few people.
 
 
One m or ning I c am e back  fr om the night s hift. I always  would c ome in to see 
Ita
. I wo
uld 
always  c hec k on her.We wer e two year s  apart. Are you ok
? 
She s aid, 
ﬁY
eah. Can you bring me s om e 
c lothing s o I c an put on m y bunk
?ﬂ 
She had bed s or es  from laying there. She had a low fever. She was  
able to get ar ound but s till got c ontagious  s ickness .I didn't was h mys elf. I didn't c are. It's  your s is ter , 

what do you c are. So if you don't c atc h it fr om her, I c atc h it from  s omebody els e. Does n't m ake any 
differ ence. But anyway, it took three days . I br ought s ome c lothing, the c loth that we c lean the 
equ
ipm ent off in the factor y. I took  s ome c lean cloths . I br ought it in and I s pread it on her bunk. 
 
 
And one day I walked in, s he thanked me for it. She was  a little better  and it felt a little s ofter. 
And then s he was  not ther e. So I appr oac hed a Jewis h policem an, happened would be outs ide
 
walking 
ar ound. We had J ewis h polic emen in the c amp. And I asked him  what happened to m y s ister. She
 
was  
ther e yes terday morning. He said s he died of typhoid, of the s icknes s, and they buried her in the bottom 

of the 
stone quarr y. So it's  s till m ind boggling to today, why did they bury her  in the bottom of the s tone 
quarry
? 
Why they didn't take her where they took  all the other  s ick people
? 
Then s he was  alr eady 
dead, thr ow her in with the other s . But her they buried in
 
the bottom of the s tone quarry.
 

8 
 
 
And then als o night s hift, the following week, after I was  als o night s hift, I cam e back . There I 
s aw my other  s is ter Hia. On the pickup truck . And I yelled r eal loud and c lear  to s ay hello to her, where 
ar e you going. I don't know what s he ans wered me. I c an't rem ember. But all of thos e people on the 
tr uck  wer e s ick people. They took  them away. In other wor ds , high fever , low fever. If you had low 
fever , you c ould fake it, you c ould go to wor k . You would be a little dizz y,
 
might not be 100% but you 
c ould
 
--
 
you don't m is s  the r oll
 
c all. That's the fir st thing.
 
So they took  her . I never  s aw her again. So the 
only one I had left was  Faige.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J us t Faige and you left in the c amp.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  That's r ight
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, you wer e involved in an esc ape attem pt. Tell us about that, Henr y.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Well, m y s ister was  wor k ing
 
--
 
ther e wer e 100 tailors , wom en and men in a 
tailor s hop. One day the high
-
r anking Germ an offic er  walked
 
in to the tailor s hop and he told the tailor 
s he m us t hurr y up with all of thes e uniform s. They have to be ready by s uch and s uc h date bec ause all 

of you ar e going to be deported out of here. And the tailor s didn't like what they heard. They c am e bac k  
and
 
they organized an es c ape amongs t them s elves . They wouldn't tell anybody. 
 
 
Then finally my s is ter told m e the day before the es c ape. My s hift was  from 3:00
 
in the 
after noon to 11:00
 
at night. 
ﬁ
When you c om e back  at 11:00, do not go into the barr ack at all
. Wait for 
m e and we ar e going to es c ape.
ﬂ 
I was  alr eady 15 year s  old. I was  looking for ward to get out of this  hell 
plac e at 15 year s  old. I said
 
--
 
they didn't tr eat m e that well, hungry, dirty, filthy. And beatings all the 
tim e.
 
 
So my s is ter wouldn't tell m e anything about it until the night before. The night befor e, m y s hift 
was  from 3:00
 
to 11:00. 
ﬁ
Do not go ins ide the barrack . Wait for  m e outs ide.
ﬂ  
I was  waiting, pitc h dark. 
She c ame along with that s ame J ewis h polic em an who I asked about the other s is ter. I didn't know she 
knew him . That I don't know. All I know is  s he was  holding his hand. She grabbed my hand.We had to 
r un like to the end of the r oom here, the theater  to run out ther e. And we wer e 10 in a gr oup. 10 lined 
up. So tailor s  wer e 100, 10
 
tim es  10. So we wer e all lined up.Waiting for es c ape. 
 
 
Three r ows  got out very quietly. The third group thought of br inging s om ething fr om the 
fac tor y, c lippers to c ut the wire fenc e. It was  not an elec tr ic fenc e, just plain bar bed wire. Opened up a 

big
ger plac e. So m or e than one per s on
 
--
 
10 r an to the plac e but only one at a tim e c ould squeeze 
through. So it took for ever . A long tim e. And then they wanted to do it r eal fast s o m or e people will 

es c ape. 
 
 
We wer e waiting in line. Well, the s ame group that were destined to leave the plac e started 
m es s ing around with the wooden fenc e. And the wooden fenc e m ade noise. The bar bed wire didn't 

m ake any nois e at all. They s tarted br eaking boards. That attr acted the Ger man Shepher d dogs . They 
kept barking and s c r
eaming and barking mostly. So the two guar ds on the tower  knew ther e was  
s om ething wr ong. So they flipped the lights on. They flipped the lights on
 a
nd then running ar ound with 
the lights trying to find wher e does it c ome from, the nois e. They found the s p
ot
 w
her e the people wer e 
r unning out. So both of them  start s hooting. Ever ybody that was  at the hole, kept shooting ther e. Then 
the next. 
 
 
Then with us, we were waiting in line. After quiet, nobody was  r unning out anymore, things  
quieted. Put the s ear c h lights  on us. Ther e wer e 10 at the time, we were waiting in line. They only had 
two guns. So the polic em en
 
--
 
first they put the headlights on us. So it was  jus t like a deer  on the 
highway. The deer  fr eezes , does n't know whic h way to go. The polic em en told us run, dis per s e, run 

bac k  to the bar r ack  where you belong.We started running back . 
 
 
Somehow I got separ ated fr om m y s ister but they kept s hooting at us and the bullet s truck the 
b
ack might of  my h
ead. A bullet gr azed m e. It didn't go ins ide. But never theles s , it s till knock s  you out 
fr om  the impac t. It knock s  me out.When I woke up a few s ec onds  later , the blood was  r unning all over 
m e in the back, all the way down in the s hirt, all the way thr ough the pants , all the way outs ide. They 
opened up a two
-
in
c h gas h in the back  m ight have head. 
 
 
So I woke up and I s aid, Faige, why would you leave m e alone her e
? 
I'm only 15 year s  old. 
You prom is ed my mother  you were going to tak e c are of me. Wher e are you
? 
Why would you es c ape
? 

9 
 
Leave m e all by m ys elf. Then I t
hought I better s tar t 
thinking about m ys elf. I s aid, Dear God, you have 
to watc h over  me s o I don't get s hot again, s o I c an get to Am er ic a s om eday to vis it m y s is ter in 
Am eric a. I know s he was  s afe. I k new s he was  protec ted. 
 
 
I was  tr ying to get back . I did not find her on the way. Ins tead of going to my plac e, where I 
belonged, I went to the wom en's barr ack .When I went into the women's  barr ack , the woman opens  the 
door , ﬁWhat ar e you doing
?ﬂ  
She s hut the door. She didn't let m e in. "You're going to get 
us all killed." 
ﬁY
ou'r e full of blood.
ﬂ 
I s aid I alm os t got killed mys elf. The wom an knew my name. I k new her name. 
She was  jus t in c harge of the gir ls in the barracks "I'm  looking for m y s ister Faige." "She's  not her e." I 

s aid, 
ﬁH
ow c an you ans wer  that fa
st s he's not
 
here, you wer en't even looking?ﬂ
 
 
By that tim e, they s topped s hooting. And then the two guards  were angr y that we wer e tr ying 
to es c ape s o they started r andomly s hooting at the barr acks. The one that was  picked was  the 

women's  barr ack , s hooting into that. All the women jumped off the bunks, on the ground. I was  s itting 
on the ground. So I s till looked for my sis ter  Faige but I c ould not s ee her. Who do I run acr os s
? 
It was  
Ita
. She's  the one that helped me with the bleeding when I got hit. I c ame into the bar r ack . She s aid, 
ﬁW
hat are you doing here
?ﬂ  
I s aid, 
ﬁL
ooking for  Faige.
ﬂ  
She s ays, 
ﬁT
r ust me, s he's  not her e. I know 
what bunk  s he is and I k now s he's  not here.What happened to you
?ﬂ  
I explained what happened. She 
s tarted c leaning. She c am e over  with a bucket of water, r ag, c leaned me up a little bit. She took  a dry 
r ag, put it in m y wound. She took  off the beret that s he was  wearing and put it on m y head. She says , 

ﬁL
et that rag be ti
ght agains t your wound s o you won't bleed anym or e.
ﬂ 
 
I tried to get out ther e have bec aus e if they would catc h m e in the women's  barrack , I wouldn't 
be here, es c aping with a wound on top of my head. So I tried to get back  to m y barr ack . I do r emember 
c ount
ing up from one to 15.Why I was  c ounting, I don't r emember . But I was  c ounting to s ee
 
--
 
I think  
the s ear c h lights wer e going. C
an 
I 
beat the s ear ch light back  to my barr ack?
 
So I lower ed m y head. I
t 
was  the oppos ite direc tion. The s ear c h light
 
--
 
I made 
it to m y barrack  back  befor e the lights c ame over  
towar ds  m e. I was  alr eady ins ide m y barr ack . And I s aid, thank  God I'm s afe now. I want peac e.
 
 
In the m or ning, louds peaker,
 A
ttention, attention
; 
ever ybody out. Another roll c all. They 
wanted this  tim e like we line up for  work every day. We had to line up in the fr ont of the barrack . This  
tim e they wanted to s ee how m any es caped. So they wer e c ounting us .
 
Let's s ay ther e was  100 in the 
bar rack , ther e was  only 75. Well, 25 people unacc ounted for. They either  wounded at the hole, 
es c aped, or  they killed som e of them. 
 
 
They didn't do that exac tly. 
The f
irs t thing 
they
 
did is  c heck  the barr ack  if anybody els e is  s till 
in ther e. No one was  in ther e. The stilts , they let dogs under. Nobody was  there. So all the 
m is s ing 
people, they either  got out or they wer e wounded or killed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  s is ter was  one of thos e killed. Right?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  I did not know wher e m y sis ter s till was . Right in the front of our fac es , he told 

us to tur n in the o
pposite direc tion.We tur ned towards  the hole. Ther e I looked. The polic em an was  s till 
alive. He was  s itting on the gr ound, upr ight pos ition, with the arm  band, s till s itting, moaning and 

groaning, other people moaning and groaning. Ther e were wounded people ther e. And right in front of 

our  fac es  the two guards killed all the wounded ones . So as  s oon as the polic eman tilted over and 
dr opped to the floor , I s aw m y s is ter  Faige. She was  alr eady dead. She didn't move. She was  all 
s tr etc hed out. She either got 
hit the night befor e when I got hit or  m aybe s he made it to the hole and 
then fell and died that way. I don't know the ans wer . All I know is  s he was  dead. All I know, I was  15 

year s  old and I was  by mys elf.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, yes , you're all alone now. You've los t ever ybody. We'r e getting c los e to the end 

of the progr am and you have a gr eat deal still to tell us. Tell us now about going to Auschwitz, of 

c our se, and what happened to you at Ausc hwitz.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  That day, that magic  day cam e
 
when the high
-
r anking offic er told the tailor s  
they m ust have everything r eady. That day c ame. They got extra s oldier s , always  extra s oldier s. They 
c has ed us down for s ix k ilom eters toward the railroad s tation. They packed us  in like s ar dines  into the 
c ar
, the fr eight c ars. No water , no bathroom. It was  very hot, Septem ber
 
--
 
I don't rem em ber what 
m onth it was . I don't really r em em ber . But all I know it was  s till hot. They stuc k  us in and locked the 

10
 
 
door s  fr om the outs ide. Then we wer e tr aveling for thr ee 
days . Every wher e we s topped we were not 
pr ior ity tr ans port. Civilian c ar s c ame through.We had to s top. It took forever, for thr ee days , to travel. 
Ever y s top we s topped, in unis on, we wer e s c r eam ing
, 
"Water
!
" in different languages . We didn't as k  
for food
, just water . They wouldn't give us  anything.
 
 
We tr aveled. We finally reac hed our destination and it was  Aus c hwitz
-
Bir k enau. 
Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau, on the platfor m they stopped. The s oldiers  opened our doors  up. They were 
s c r eam ing out. One or thr ee or one or two, I don't remem ber, dead people on our c ar. The stenc h was  

to high heaven in ther e. I don't know how long they were dead. But ever ybody ran over  to that little 
window that the wagon has , about 15
-
inc hes , m aybe 10
-
inc hes , with the barbed wire on it, to
 
get a 
br eath of fr es h air . Som e people wer e ver y s elfis h. They wouldn't move away fr om ther e. We had our  

little skirm is hes in ther e. And then we ar r ived.
 
 
The first thing they did when you got off the train is  gave us  a hair c ut. That's  the firs t thing. 
Th
e s ec ond thing was  a number on the ar m. Ever ybody that c ame through Aus c hwitz, c ame with 
num ber s on the c lothes. But they gave us a regular  tattoo num ber. My num ber was  18991. That was  
m y number. And the third s top, shower. After three years  of not s hower ing, we finally got into the 
s hower. They gave us a piec e of s oap. We wer e s o thirs ty, we kept drinking the water . We finally got 
through with the water drinking. Then we c leaned our s elves  up. They took away our  c lothes full of lice. 
And they gave us  our  str iped outfits with the c ap, the jacket, pants , wooden bottom s hoes
. No 
underwear or s ocks. They s till gave us  a little blanket. Every wher e you go, they gave us that three
-
foot 
little blanket rolled up
, la
ter when we wer e us ing it on the m ar c h.

on:  You were s elec ted for s lave labor again.

-
Bir kenau. The people that were ther e befor e us told us  
how luc ky we were bec aus e s ometimes  they c oax you into the s hower  r oom and it's  r eally not a shower  

r oom. Ins te
ad of water , you wind up with gas  and they gas you to death. So we wer e pretty lucky.
 
 
But as we c ame off, we had another s election, as  we c am e off the tr ain. Left, r ight, left, r ight. 
There was  the I.D. c ar ds did not help you in Aus chwitz at all. They loo
ked at your fac es, left, r ight. They 
took half of our  tr ans por t. We k new the next two days  later that they took them  to the gas  c hamber. 
They had an or der how many they need to dis pos e of or they didn't have any r oom. I think  they had an 

or der how m any they needed to kill. Half of our trans por t was  taken c ar e of, were killed.
 
 
We stayed
 
--
 
I was  s till luc ky. We s tayed ther e for  s ix m onths . A c ivilian Germ an c ame in to 
Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau with two guar ds , c am e in
, t
he barr ack outs ide. We were s till in pr etty 
good 
c ondition. And that c ivilian Germ an got 50 of us  out of there, out of the 100 that was  in the barrack . 50. 

You c ould not ask  any questions . What ar e you pic king m e for
? 
Ar e you going to give m e a job
? 
A re 
you going to kill m e
? 
We c ould not ask  anything. The guards were s tanding there with the rifles and the 
dogs. He was  dr es s ed ver y nic ely
, t
he man
, an
d took 50 of us out. 
 
 
We mar c hed for  thr ee kilom eter s . We c am e to a plac e c alled Buna
-
Monowitz, a s ubc amp of 
Aus c hwitz. And that man was  either a m anager or owner  or  part owner. He was  not a private per s on to 

c om e into a cam p and get 50 people to work  for  him . He took  us to a place c alled IG Far ben. They 

pr oduc e gas, bug s prays , autom obile tir es , bullets, s ynthetic fuel. But the 50 that that c ivilian took
, for 
one r eas on only. He wanted us to build a road in the c om pound of the fac tor y with the c obbles tone r oad 

and the s idewalk. 
 
 
And thr ee m onths we were doing that. And the winter was  no pleas ur e, no gloves . We had to 
take c are of that stone. We had to unload the m is demeanor to build the road. They wer e on fr eight 
c ar s . They gave you a shovel. In the beginning you wor k  your s elf in. Once you wer e on to the car, you 
have to tak e s hovel by s hovel. You get blis ter s all over your hand from not wear ing gloves  from the 

s hovel. And they only gave you a c ertain tim e to unload. They didn't give you all day long to unload. 
You didn't want to get whipped with the whip s o you had to work pretty hard. Thr ee m onths. 
 
 
And then s oon enough the Am eric an Air For c e finally c am e a
nd bom bed the IG Farben 
factor
y. They didn't go ins ide. They 
on
ly 
bom bed the outs ide
, t
he r ailway leading into it. That's why  they 
wanted to have a c obbles tone r oad, for  the trucks to be able to pull in, in cas e the rail c an't make it.
 

11
 
 
The Air  For c e c am e back  more aggres s ive. They knocked out the whole fac tor y. They had a bunk er in 
ther e. It was  not for us. We had to wor k  right through the bombing as  they wer e bombing bec aus e our 
guy was  a kapo watc hing us . He was  hiding s o he wouldn't get hit by the s hrapnel but he didn't give a 
dar n about us.We had to wor k  right thr ough.
 
 
One day we were working when the Air Forc e c am e back , the Am eric an Air Forc e c am e back . 
They were bombing the ar ea. And s ur e enough we s ee s ome uniform ed guys . Ther e wer e Britis h 

s ol
diers , 10 of them, with pickup wagons. They wer e just picking up the tras h fr om the fac tor y. That's all 
they did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They wer e pris oners of war ?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Yes . They wer e caught by the Germans , war  pr isoner s . But they tr eated them 
w
ell. They looked very nic ely dr es s ed, c lean and they were not hungry. They told us , 
ﬁD
don't give up, 
don't give up
. T
his  is Amer ic an Air  For c e bombing you. Don't give up.
ﬂ 
And then they left. We never  
s aw them again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, you would get s ent yet to another c am p, Flos s enburg, and then on a Death 
Marc h. Tell us in our  r emaining time about the Death Marc h and then your liber ation.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Well, the Death Mar c h, we were marc hing bec aus e of the
 
--
 
we wer e r iding fir st 
in tr ains. T
hen the good old Americ an Air Forc e took  c ar e of that in the beginning. They would knoc k  
out the loc omotive. They wouldn't bother  with the c ars  bec aus e they knew we were in thos e c ars. So 
they didn't bother us. But they kept s hooting. They put it out of c o
mm is s ion
, t
he railroad and als o the 
loc omotive. But then later  on they got s o aggres s ive that somehow we were r iding on tr ains, tr ying to 

m ake it to Flos s enburg. 
 
 
We finally m ade it to Flos s enburg. We stayed in Flos s enburg only a few m onths. No wor k  for  
u
s  over  ther e other  than bundling up c lothing. It was  a stor y high of c lothes, c lothing fr om m ur dered 
people, c hildr en's c lothes , m en's  c lothes , wom en's  c lothes.We had to bundle them up in bundles . They 
were s ent to Germ any for  rec yc ling.
 
Then we had to abandon Flos s enburg bec aus e the Am er ic an Ar m y 
was  c om ing to liber ate Flos s enburg. Rum or s.We were told the Rus s ians  would do that. At the Czec h 

or  Slovakian bor der, how would the Am er ic ans
 
get ther e.
 
 
But nevertheles s
 
they got ther e. But the Germ ans wer e not
 
that stupid. Three days  before 
they load
ed
 
us  up on tr ains  and they took  us in deeper  into Germany
, o
nly left a c r ew of 10, cleanup 
c r ew. So the Amer ic an Ar m y, when they liberated Flos s enburg, all they found is  the c leanup c rew. We 
were alr eady deeper into Germ any. We wer e trying to m ake a plac e c alled Dac hau.We were at that 
tim e alr eady on foot.
 
 
So we c am e 
on 
tr ains , and then one day we were tr aveling thr ough c ountrys ide ver y quietly. 
All you c ould hear  was the loc omotive c hoic e, c hoo, 
c hoo, c hoo, with 
the sm oke r unning out, the s team  
out of the loc om otive. And we wer e on that plac e called the black  field. And that tr ain had a c arload full 
of SS guys . And the Americ an Air Forc e
s 
m us t have known that bec aus e that day they didn't bom b just 
the loc om otive or  the rail. They waited, c irc led around over us  a little while firs t until the uniformed guys  

jum ped out of their c ar s and opened our car s. That's the only way we c ould c ome out if they opened it. 

They told us  to run into the woods . The woods , running 10
f
eet, you had to dr op. The dogs  wer e ther e, 
s oldier s  pointing the rifles , the guns  at you. So you had to drop.
 
 
That tr ain was dem olis hed fr om loc om otive to the las t c ar and the r ail. Everything was  ups ide 
down. From then on we had to mar c h. And it was  alr eady the 24th of April, 1945. We wer e already 

s tarting to get skeletal
-
lik e. Under tr aveling we didn't get any food, not m uch food in the c amp. The 
m enu was  a s lic e of br ead, a little black  imitation coffee, and als o in the evening after working 10 hours , 

t
hey gave c abbage water s oup. You c ould not find a leaf of c abbage in there. They gave us a s poon. I 
don't know why they gave us  a s poon. The s poon was
 
--
 
I never  took  it off. They never gave m e any 
s olid food to us e
 
a s poon, j
ust watery stuff.
 
 
On the 24th
 
of A pr il
 
1945, the two guar ds  got hungry, too. They ran out of s upplies. So they 
loc ated a farm. They located farm s  before but they didn't stay too long. This  one, on the 24th of April, 

1945, they knew that they wer e los ing the war. The militar y people hear d the news , I'm s ur e. We were 

not awar e of it.We heard planes  flying all over .
 

12
 
 
 
This  tim e they order ed us  into a s ilo to keep the hay and als o the goats and s heep in there. 
They didn't let us  like dogs and anim als  get s helter , s leep in the woods
. If it 
was  raining or s nowing, you 
wr apped your s elf up with a blanket and tried to be bones  with bones, laying, tr ying to keep war m.
 
And then on the 24th, they s omehow order ed us  into the s ilo.We wer e s oaking wet fr om the April 
s howers , the s triped uniform s s oggy.We cam e in, took  our clothes  off, laid them down on the hay to 
dr y. Then we saw goats  and s heep. It was  kind of warm  in there which was  nic e.
 
While they were 
feas ting on a big meal, they gave us one r aw potato. That's  all. And s om e water to dr ink . You wer e s o 
hungry you c ould eat 10. Only one potato. That's  all they gave you.
 
 
And then that mor ning they woke us  up ear ly. We had to put the partially wet c lothes  on. They 
didn't dry out. Again, we put it on the bes t we c ould. Roll up the little blank et. It was  a beautiful morning 
a beautiful day. A breeze was  c om ing. And then all of a s udden they woke us  up ear ly. They m arc hed 

us  for  a c ouple of hour s . They put us near a wooded ar ea. And that's wher e you s it.
 
 
They gave us  another walk in the m or ning. So that was  a no
-
no. We k new s omething was  
happening. What we didn't know. But when they put us near the wooded area and then all of a s udden 
we s aw on the highway maybe half a block away
 
--
 
well, we didn't know the markings  on the 
equipment. What kind of Ar m y w
as it
? 
It was  the Am er ic an Ar m y was  there. They knew it was  the 
Am eric an Arm y. We didn't know. All of a s udden they r an away fr om  us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The guar ds  r an away?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  The two guards r an away fr om  us and let us s it by ours elves . We
 
were angr y 
why they left us her e. Anybody now c an kill us . But they were the ones that actually got the c hance of 
doing it but they were afraid to kill us bec aus e the gun makes too muc h nois e and they would have 
been c aptured by the Am er ic an Ar my, half a bloc k  away they c ould hear the nois e. With binoc ulars  they 
pr obably would s end a jeep or whatever after them  and they would have been c harged with war  c r imes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They took  off and ther e you are.
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  By our s elves , 50 of us 
left f
r om 100.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And when did the Am er ic ans  get to you?
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Then all of a s udden we wer e about three hours, maybe two hours  later, an 
Am er ic an tank
 
--
 
we didn't know it was  Am er ic an. It took  off on the m ain highway towar ds  u
s . Five feet 
away the tank  stops . The s oldier squeezes  hims elf out of the hatc h. It was  kind of tight in there. Blond 
c r ew c ut hair. I wis h I knew his  name. I don't know his  name. Then all of a s udden he got out of the 
tank, he s tood up in the hedge, put his hands  on his  m outh. He s ays  "We are Americ ans and all of you 
ar e free." Until I hear the wor d free
 
--
 
still r uns  through m y body now. But I was  17 year s  old already. 
That was  the bes t time of m y life. I s aid, Lor d, thanks for  s aving our life but why did
 
it take s o you long
? 
We k ept s aying that to ours elves .
 
 
All of a s udden he yelled
 
--
 
ther e was  another s oldier on the tank. Squeezed him s elf out of the 
tank. He yelled at him to throw out all the r ations that you have.We wer e clim bing like c ats  and dogs  

tr ying to gr ab a ration. I don't think I got to one.
 
He s aw we were going to hur t our s elves . 
 
 
Somebody had to s peak  Englis h in our  gr oup. I under s tood a little bit but I didn't know what 
they wer e talking about.
 
All of a s udden he told us  to s top with the
 
r ation. The two got back on the tank. 
They told us  to follow them. They took  us  out of the field and the woods , a
cr os s  the road, into a farm
, 
i
nto the far m where both s oldier s  jum ped off the tank . One s oldier  r an for the door
, th
e other one for us 
to go i
n.
 
We wer e five year s
™ 
hungry. We didn't think  they were going to have food ins ide for  us . So 
outs ide the farmer's  hous e, thr ee big dis hes of or pales , whatever you c all it, potato peeling
s
. I didn't 
need my s poon. Potato peelings  wer e there with white flour on it.We never  looked at the two angels  

that gave us  back  our fr eedom. We were on our  hands  and knees , s hoved as  m any potato peelings you 

c ould s tuff yourself. How we didn't c hoke is  beyond me bec aus e you c ould hardly c hew them . You 
wanted to get as m uc h as  you c an. We ate up all of thes e
 
--
 
c leaned off the three trays . Then we went 
ins ide. We looked at each other like. They had a pr epar ed table for us with regular food.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Greenbaum:  Food I wouldn't s ee at hom e even!  Ver y good
-
lo
oking. But we wer e not hungr y 
anym or e. And the two angels  that gave us  our  fr eedom  didn't let us eat. Drink lots  of water. So we wer e 

13
 
 
dr inking lots  of water.We heard c r ies.We were in there, two rooms  away  in the farm hous e they had 
s om e people that wer e liberated the night before and they had all of this  good food. And they wer e 
s c r eam ing "Doctor, doctor , help. Doctor, doc tor ." They heard us  making nois e. We hear d them. The two 
angels  had to c all for r einfor c ements
, t
he two Americ an s oldier s . They had to c
all for  the m edic s  to 
c om e in. The m edic s c am e in. They gave ever ybody m edic ation for  the people who wer e c omplaining 

with the s tomac h pr oblem . Either their stomac h couldn't abs or b norm al food or they over ate. I think  they 

over ate. I think they overate.

>  Bill Bens on: We were at the end of our tim e. Obvious ly we c ould have had Henry and you her e for 
the r es t of the afternoon. We c learly had to skip over m any things  and we're not hearing about what

Bergen

Bels enen and I ran into m y c ous in that s aved me with the blood, she was  going to Poland. 
ﬁ
Do 
you want to go to Poland with m e
?ﬂ ﬁ
I'm looking for my brother,
ﬂ  
s he s aid. Well, I s aid m y br other 
Zac her y was  in the Army, m aybe look  for them , too, but I'm  too s c ared to go
 
to Poland. But if you go 
and you find your  br other, your first c ous in, tell him  that I'm alive. I was  in a dis plac ed pers ons  c amp 
or
 
--
 
three good meals a day. But anyway, m ake it fast. 
 
 
So s he went to Poland, loc ated her br other in a Dis plac ed Per s ons  C
amp. Her brother knew 
wher e m y brother Zac her y. He was  c aught by the Ger mans . He was  fighting the war they didn't put him 
in with the m ilitar y bec aus e he was  J ewis h. They put him into a ghetto in Lithuania, ghetto. He m ade his  
way bac k in after the Rus s ians  left Poland. Then he m ade it back into Poland.
 
And then s he told him  I 
was  alive. Thr ee weeks later he c am e. 
 
 
To make a long s tory s hort, he c

In 
theWas hington ar ea. All I knew, in New Yor k . I didn't know wher e s he lives . It s o happened I was  glad 
s he m et the fir st c ous in and m aintained the s am e nam e but s pelled a little different. It was  between a Y

they let us in
