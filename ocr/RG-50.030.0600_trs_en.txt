Octo ber 17, 2010
 
                     
Question:  This is the United States Holoca
ust Memorial Museum interview with Eleanor 
Rolfe conducted by Agnisha (ph) McClure on
 October 17th, 2010 at the Kindertransport 
Association conference in Arlington, Virgin ia. 
 Hello.  It's  very nice to meet you, and to 
have you here with us.  Th
ank you.  Could you please
 say your name yourself?  
Answer:  Eleanor Rolfe.  
Q:  Could you please tell us wh
en were you born and where? 
A:  January 31st, 1930 in Hamburg, Germany.  
Q:  Can you tell me w h at are your first reco
llections of your family life in Hamburg, 
Germany?  

A:  Surprisingly, I can reme
mber back to when I was th
ree years old, wh ich always 
amazes my brother.  I remember 
that in my bedroom, they pu
t a rug with flowers in the 
middle and a design around the edge.  And I wo
uldn't let  anybody wa
lk on th e flowers.  
And I would go around the corn er to my  bed. 
 And that's my first 
memory of my room.  
But I  then I did rememb er my  daughter went to
 Germany with me in '
74, I think.  And I  
we went to where I lived, my 
house and  but it wasn 't until  
was that when 
we went into 
the house?  I don 't remember.  We went back 
in 2001, the spring befo
re 9/11.  And I was 
invited by th e City of Hamburg.
  And my husband said for my
 daughter to come with me

because she would remember this and pass it 
onto her children.  So it was a w o nderful 
trip.  And I had explained how my  house,
 my apartment was laid out. And I   
had a veranda in front of my  room.  And we 
went and knocked on th
e door or we were 
standing in front of th e place and people sa
id can we help  you?  And it was an American 
married to a German.  And I to
ld him that this was the house wh ere I was born.  And so 
they invited us in.  And it was really intere
sting because she said 
to me, Mom, this is 
exactly the way you described it. 
 So I  could we jump ahead?  
Q:  I would like to ma ybe ask you also about 
your family.  You said you had a brother.  
Was it an older brother or younger brother?   
A:  Yes, my brother is three years older. 
 And we were completely assimilated  in 
Germany.  My father had been in the German
 army , and had all sorts of medals.  He was 
injured in the first World War.  And we had a 
Christmas tree.  I didn'
t really know I was 
Jewish.  I went to public school until quite
 late, then I had to change schools.  
Q:  What language did you sp
eak at home, was this German? 
A:  German, yes. 
Q:  Did you have any Jewish frie
nds or just German friends?   
A:  Of course I had my  grandmother a
nd grandfather and my  uncle who had  was 
somewhat disabled.  He had th e flu in 1918
 and stopped his mental development so he 
was  though he was an adult, he was approx
imately the age of twelve or thirteen.  We 
played a lot of games  he taught me games 
and things.  My grandparents lived quite a

walking distance.  And there was another Germ
an family living near us and, yes, I was 
friends with them.  I can 't really recollect a 
lot of friends, I guess they
 didn't stay in my 
memo ry .  
Q:  Would you say that your fa
mily was a religious family?   
A:  No, my mother came from an  orthodox
, very orthodox home
.  And she rebelled 
against it because she said that
 they were not allowed to do 
anything on the Sabbath, and 
her father would walk outside 
and get around the corn er and light a cigar.  So although 
they had a maid, I guess, who was allowed to tu
rn  the light on but she 
 so she married my  
dad.  My  dad came  there was a lot of money 
in the family, but my father was not raised 
Jewish, although both his parents were.  His fa
ther died when  he wa
s three.  And he was 
a playboy.    

Q:  I see. 
A:  And he was  he went to 
law school and was an attorney. 
 And as I remember what my 
mother said, her father who wa
s orthodox really stepped in  between that and didn't want 
to marry  her to marry my dad.
  And so  she was sent to England fo r a year and to ld if you 
still want to marry him when you 
come back after a year, it's 
okay.  So she did that.  And 
my  parents kept everything.  I have papers 
and papers and papers. 
 I have all of their 
letters. 

Q:  Really.  That's very valuable.  We are I'
m sure going to  talk about
 that in a little bit 
too. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
6 
A:  Yeah.  
Q:  You mentioned that your brother was th
ree years older than you were.  What's his 
name? 

A:  His name was Osfeld Eric Stark (ph).  My mother specifically, she was always 
worried about the situation. 
 But probably because of he
r background because she was 
orthodox.  My father felt it wa
s a German.  And my
 mo th er gave us each international 
names.  Eleanor is good in any language and 
Eric also.  So  but 
in Germany my  brother 
was called Osfeld (ph).  And so  he ch anged it, of course, to Eric Osfeld. 
Q:  Were you very close with your brother? 
A:  Quite.   

Q:  Did you play a lot together, 
did you go to the same school? 
A:  I'm not sure.  I was eight when I went on
 the Kindertransport, but I was about five, I 
think, five or six wh en my  brother was sent
 to board ing school in England.  And my  
brother was very precocious an
d very intelligent, and he was 
constantly listening to what 
we then called the wireless, and so it was  coul
d you go up and get that postcard?  So they  
sent him to board ing school in England by
 a German teacher at Bunscord (ph) you 

probably heard that before. 
Q:  I have to say that I'm hearing that for 
the first time right now.  Could you explain 
what it is? 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
7 
A:  It was a boarding school for German Je
wish children.  And it was headed up by a 
woman and something  I don 't 
remember the name, but I th
ink I have it written.  We 
called her Tatta Ana (ph).  And by the time 
 well, a lot of the children from wealthy 
families were sent ther e, especially the boys. 
Q:  So you mentioned th
at your family was quite affluent, right?   
A:  Yes. 
Q:  Was it also the case with your parents? 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  What was  your father, I belie
ve you mentioned, was a lawyer? 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  And your mother, did she also work?   
A:  No, she was a housewife although we had lo
ts of maids.  So she didn't  really do 
anything.  And rememb er that in 1937, my 
father bought a car, Mercedes Benz.  And I 
was told later by one of my cousins that Da
d was the only one  our family was the only 
one who owned a car in the '30s.  I reme mb er 
that when my father 
bought this car, it was 
green.  I have a picture of it at home.  My 
mother imme diately had 
to have a driving suit 
made to match the car.  
Things I remember.

I lived a very typical European
 life that was certainly totally
 opposite of what my life 
with my children was, but it was  my pare
nts would send me to kindaponceons (ph) on 
holid ays. 
Q:  What are those? 
A:  Those were  ponceon (ph) is like a camp . 
Q:  Uh huh. 
A:  Children's camp and it was  I remember I 
was in Switzerland over the new year.  My 
parents entertained a lot.  And I was in Be
lgium in the summers.  A nd I was pretty little, 
but it was organized, you know. 
 And I don't ever remember 
even sitting on my father's 
lap.  It was very distant relationship. 

Q:  Were you also distant with your 
mother or just with your father? 
A:  Mostly with my 
father, yeah.  But I don
't  reme mb er l o ng  c
onversations with my 
mo ther.  It just wasn't the thing to do in  those days. 

Q:  I can assume that.  Did 
you play  with her at all? 
A:  I don't rememb er playing with her, no.  
I played with my  uncle
 who lived with my 
grandparents and he taught me games and domi
noes and stuff like that. 
 I remember that.  
He was the only grown up that ever paid attention to me. 

Q:  Was that the uncle you menti
oned that was sick with the flu? 
A:  What? 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe

Q:  Was that the uncle you mentioned befo re 
that was sick with th
e flu as a young boy?  
A:  Yes, he had the flu in 1918.  And he wa
s fine, but he was disabled.  I mean, he had a 
little bit of a lame arm and 
his mind stopped developing, 
but he was lovely, lovely 
person, very lovable.  And I 
think he enjoyed being with me.  I rememb er on Ch ristmas  
we even had a Christmas tree 
fire once because in those 
days, there were candles on 
them.  I don't know how they managed that. 
Q:  They were real, right? 
A:  They were real candles, and they hung 
those little rin g s on the tree, that chocolate 
candy with the little w h ite 
dots, nonpareils.  Yes. 
Q:  I'm trying to imagine how it looks.  C
hocolate candy with th
e little white dots, like 
sugar?   

A:  Yeah.    
Q:  Confectionary  sugar on top of them.  
A:  In this country they are nonpareils and 
they're dark chocolate with sugary white little 
things.  And they were rings
, and th ey were hung on th e 
tree along with other things.  
And I remember putting our shoes at Chri
stmastime or before Christmas.   
We also had a Menorah, I think, that was 
passed down .  And I don't reme mb er it in my  
home in Germany, but we had a big, beautif
ul, silver Menorah that I first really 
experienced when we came to 
the United States.  And I know
 that what  I got back

together with my  parents.  Yo
u wanted to know  wh at else
 did you want to know about 
Germany? 
Q:  I wanted to also ask  you're obviou
sly saying that you were living in  the multi 
religious environment, right, both th e Ch ristmas tree and a menorah? 

A:  I don't remember the Me
norah in my German house. 
Q:  Not in the German house, but that was here in the states, right? 

A:  Yeah.  And I think the Meno
rah was with my grandparents. 
Q:  I see. 
A:  It was handed down  
fro m my  mo th er 's f a mily . 
Q:  I see.  Did you ever  do you recall goi
ng to the synagogue or performing any    
A:  No. 

Q:  Did you know any Jewish prayers?   
A:  No. 
Q:  How about the atmosphere in the City
 of Hamburg, do you rememb er what it was 
before the outbreak of the war? 

A:  It was before  although my mother was 
very aware, she told me
 later, she was very 
frightened, but in 19  I believe
 '36 or '37 is when they se
nt my brother away, but I was 
still there.  And I had a pretty
 normal life.  I remember ma
y mother taking me to some 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
11 
tailor to have my  clothes made.  And I kn
ow th at what you looked like was terribly 
important. 
Q:  Certainly.   

A:  Very German.  I do remember having very
 close to the end when I was sent away, I 
had to ch ange schools.  I believe that because
  my father was an attorney and some kind 
of a municipal judge, a
nd I do believe that   

Q:  There is a little gnat here. 
A:  God, I can 't get rid  of it.  Okay.  That's w
hy he  he always said this is happening to all 
of those Jews, not us. 

Q:  I see, so he didn't belie
ve that the growing tension was 
going to have any effect   
A:  On him. 
Q:    on your family? 
A:  No.  No.  I  possibly deep in his heart,
 he was  might have been th inking  fooling 
himself, but he was so mu ch a German and ne
ver really considered himself Jewish.  And 
I believe his parents were also assimilated. 
 He came from a very 
wealthy family.  I know 
very little about his family.  
I believe that originally 
the family came from Holland 
because the name Stork is quite Dutch.  But 
I remember visiting his 
mother very rarely.  
She was very stiff, pompous woman.  I never  
my mother's parents were very loving, but 
I don't really know much about his parents. 
 He was  my  my  Grandfather Stork died 
when  Dad was three years old right around the tu
rn of the century.  My father was born in 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
12 
1897.  And I had  many, many years it never da
wned on me that  I th
ought he had a heart 
attack and died. 
Q:  What happened? 

A:  Not until many, many years later, my  aunt 
that I visited in Boston to ld me oh, no, 
your grandfather committed 
suicide.  He had some financial set backs. 
Q:  I see. 

A:  And I was so relieved because one of my  
sons very much looks 
like my family.  My 
other son is very mu ch like his dad's family. 
 And Brian always said
 I'm fine.  I don't 
need the checkups and st
uff.  And I said you have to get a checkup. 
Q:  Because of the heart issue, rig h t? 

A:  Because I thought my grandfather died of 
a heart attack.  And my father had his first 
heart attack when  he was in his 50s.  And so
 I was  and Brian finally had  his wife made 
him have a checkup.  And he wrote to me  he liv
ed in different places.  He's been part of 
corporate America.  And he wrote to me an d sa
id  or he called me  and he said mo m, my  
heart's perfect.  So  and then of course 
my  aunt told  me, oh, no, your grandfather 
committed suicide.  Best
 news I ever had. 
Q:  That's  unusual. 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  But I guess I can s
ee your point personally. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
13 
A:  Well, yeah, when my
 father was three years old, he wa
s a child late in life.  He was 
pretty mu ch raised by an older br
other who was already 20 wh en   
Q:  I see. 
A:    when Dad was a little boy. 
Q:  I see.  You mentioned th
at you were going to  school al
ready in Germany.  You said 
that you left at the age of 8, right, 
so you mu st have started really early. 
A:  Well, yes, I was in school in Germany, a
nd it was certainly not a Jewish school.  Very  
not long before I was sent away.  I had to 
ch ange schools.  And I believe  it was very 
scary in those times.  But until 
then it didn't  really affect me
.  My mother, of course, but 
she never would have told me. 
Q:  She __+ already afraid 
of what you are saying, right? 
A:  Yes, about the precarious situation we 
were in Germany.  And as I have studied 
history and learned, I was appalle
d at how my  father could have kept us there.  He could 
have left.   
My mother had a huge family a
nd they all left in early '30s
, up to '37 and they settled in 
Amsterdam.  They were in
 the tobacco business, and 
continued their business in 
Amsterdam.  And my  mo ther want
ed to leave, but my father   in retrospect, I understand, 
that my father knew that he would have to
 start life all over again if he left Germany 
because he was an atto
rney and a judge in Germany, an
d German law is based on Roman 
law.  And    

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
14 
Q:  Right. 
A:    if he went to England or the 
United States, he could not practice law. 
Q:  That's  right.  He would have to 
start pretty mu ch from the beginning. 
A:  And he was a very arrogant man.  Like 
I said, this is happenin
g to all of the other 
Jews, not me.  So I  I don't remember doing 
much with my parents 
except for  when my 
father bought a car, we used to  on Sundays
, go out into the su
burb s, I guess, and I 
reme mb er buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new.   
Q:  Popsicles.  
A:  In the late '30s. 

Q:  I see. 
A:  And, yeah.  But I, now look
ing back, my father 
lived such an affluent life.  But most 
people in Germany didn't have cars in the '30s. 

Q:  Certainly not that was a very poor time, the recession, right? 
A:  Yeah.  Well, it was inflation.  And my 
father did tell me that during  he went to 
Heidelberg  to college and he to
ld  he told of times
 when they had to  take boxes of money 
to the store, you know, b
ecause of the inflation. 
Q:  Right.  I see because you ha
d to have so  much money   
A:  Yes. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
15 
Q:    to have a certain amount to pay.  I see.  Right. 
A:  I don't believe he ever really suffe
red from it because he had lo ts of money. 
Q:  So your father never really thought th
at the situation was goi
ng to  be dangerous   
A:  Yes. 
Q:    for him or his family?  
A:  He would not believe it.  My parents   
 I have at home albums, many of them of my  
parents' trip s.  They went mountain clim
bing and they  went to Po mp eii for a wedding 
trip.  And my father was an amateur ph
otographer.  And he 
had photographs of 
everything.  They  went on many, 
many trips; never with children. 
Q:  I see.  Could you pleas
e tell me who made the decisi
on, and how did it happen that 
you actually were a part of the Kindertransport? 
A:  Yes, my father was in court on the mo
rning of the Kristanoff. 
 And he was arrested 
right in court.  I mean, he was taken.  Hi
s original law partner who was also a good friend 
was a man by th e name of Dr. Sieveking who, of
 course, that's the fi
rst thing my mother 
called when  she found out Dad was gone.  And 
he went  there's a concentration camp  
right near Hamburgh which is called Neuenga
mme, an d I understand that my  that Dr. 
Sieveking traced back to
 where my father was, went to
 Neuengamme, and told him you 
can't have this man.  Brought him home.  
I remember my father coming home and who 
was  he was always this beautifully dresse
d, clean cut gorgeous man and he came back 
home.  His head was shaved  and he was ghas
t  looked horrible.  He was only in a camp  

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
16 
for a short while.  And Dr. Sieveking came over 
 the Nazis, the same time my father was 
arrested and taken, my mo ther, of course, di
dn't know for quite a wh ile what happened to  
him, but the SS troops came into our home 
and searched  everything and pushed us 
around.  It was just me and my mother by th
at time.  I rememb er  I think it was probably 
quite early that we could no longe
r have maids or nannies so   
Q:  __+   
A:  I remember how my mother cried when Ka
ta (ph) was this nanny, I guess, who was 
always with us.  And th en we had a cook an d th
ey all had to leave.  And my  mo ther didn't 
learn how to cook until she came over to the Un
ited States.  But  so we were alone, my 
mother and I were alone.  My brother had alr
eady been sent to England.  And then Dr. 
Sieveking came back.  It was very fright
ening when  the Nazis went through our 
apartment, and messed around, you know, pus
hed us around.  But then Dr. Sieveking 
brought my dad back and oh, my , he looked  terri
ble.  And he took over, Dr. Sieveking, he 
said Eleanor is going on the Kindertransport.  
He took care of the whole thing.  And he  
after I was gone, I  he arranged for my parent
s to go to Amsterdam.  He even had the car 
transported to Amsterdam because he knew my
 father could sell it for money.  By the 
way, he was not Jewish.  Dr. Sieveking, w
ho  he was the son of a former mayor of 
Hamburgh and apparently my  father and 
 he was very close, law partners. 
Q:  Would you spell hi
s name with an "S"  
A:  Sieveking is a "Z"  

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
17 
Q:  "Z."   
A:  I think.  Sieveking.  I 
have papers at home, yeah.  An
d there's a Sieveking Platz in 
Hamburg, very famo us people.  And so anyw ay he got me on the Kindertransport.  He 
told my mother exactly wh
at to put in the suitcas
e and a little one.  And   
Q:  What was in your suitcase, do you remember that? 
A:  Would you believe a muff. 
I remember  my parents  my mother always had little 
coats and hats made with a matching mu
ff.  Why they sent a muff I don't know. 
Q:  Was it in winter? 
A:  Yes, it was.  And it was Novemb er, you know
.  I think I left  I was told that I left on 
the first Kindertransport from Hamburgh. 

Q:  So it probably was   

A:  Very early December. 
Q:  Right.  Early December.  In '3 8, right? 
A:  Yeah.  And I  as I remember, there were
 warm clothes and  but I don't rememb er a 
whole lot.  I think th ere was a doll, but I could 
have just been imagining that.  It was  the 
whole trip was kind of vague.  I know  I 
remember  it w asn 't so horrendous for me 
because I was used to being sent places.  Fo
r holidays, they would put me on a train or 
something like that with a nanny.  And I went 
places so   horrible 
life, really when you 
think back on it.  But so  it was  I remember
 b eing with all of these children, and I 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
18 
reme mb er when  we went  it could have be
en through Holland, be
fore we crossed the 
channel and the train, all of a sudden, ope
ned the windows and people reached in and 
gave us oranges and things. 
Q:  In Ho lland, right, after you crossed the border? 
A:  Yeah.  And I remember that very
 clearly, and everybody was joyous. 
Q:  Were you, too? 

A:  Yeah.  Like I say, I was used to being sent away fo r holiday s and th ings.  I, at one 
time, it came back to me
 in memory.  My pare nts lived a very adult life.  And at one time 
I was sent to a summer camp where we were a
bused and I had to s
it on a potty until I had 

a BM no matter what and oh, it was horrible.  
And I apparently would talk to my mother 
on th e phone or I  I mu st have been  five years old or so mething.  Bu t anyway somehow  
and they  didn't believe me.  They didn't , you 
know, they never really believed me until all 
of a sudden   all the parents ca
me, and the camp was closed.   
Q:  Because of the abuse, right? 
A:  Yes, because I was not the only one appare
ntly, you know.  And fi
nally they got, oh, I 
remember that was so horrible.  But never re
ally having holid ays with your parents.  I 
remember going to  Belgium on a beach wh
ere they had the little houses, you know, 
canvass little things, and I was always there with nannies. 

Q:  With nannies.  And who walked  you to the train station? 
A:  I don't know how I got there; 
probably  with the car, I don't know. 

Interv iew with El

19 
Q:  Was  were your pare
nts there or your uncle? 
A:  I think Dr. Sieveking was there.  I 
don't rememb er my  dad, but my  mo ther, my  
mother. 
Q:  What about the uncle th at you were so close with? 
A:  No, he was sent to Ho
lland.  My mother and her si
blings had promised to my  
grandparents that they will always take care of
 Walter.  And my grandm
other died in '37, 
my  mo ther's mo ther.  And my  grandfather died
 about six months later of a broken heart 
kind of.  He just couldn't make it alone.  
And so which was very 
good because he died 
before that but  so it was wh
en my grandparents were so 
sick and passed on that my  
Uncle Walter was sent to Holland. 

Q:  So Uncle Walter, that was your 
brother  your mo ther 's brother? 
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  Uh huh. 
A:  And very interesting stor
y, but I won't even go into it.
  There's a book written about 
him because he was murdered by
 a famous Dutch playwright. 
Q:  During the war or after the war? 

A:  During the war. 
Q:  What was the name  of the playwright?

A:  A very famous man.  Many
 lawsuits and I've been in 
Holland, though th
ey found me.  
Oh, Von  Von  it will come to me. 
Q:  Okay.  We can come b
ack to that later.  I can 
ask you that question later. 
A:  But anyway I rememb er only th e oranges th
at were given to us 
through the windows. 
Q:  Do you reme mb er crossing the border at
 all?  Do you remember Germans, the 
German border patrol? 

A:  No, personally not.  I could 
say that I do, but I have seen 
movies and things of it, but I 
don't remember.  Maybe I fell asleep.  I don'
t know.  I don't reme mber being frightened  
until we got to  I believe it was London.  An
d I rememb er standing in the railway station 
there where the train was going and on the 
deck, I guess they call it.  And people were 
standing there and just takingkids, you know.  And an elderly couple  I was very small 
for my  age.  I was eight years old.  And an
 elderly couple took me, took me home with 
them.  And I came from great affluence and th
ese were people that were very nice and 
loving, but they didn't have th
e central heating, and they lived
 a very simple life.  And I 
reme mb er being very  tired, and they had a bed 
for me and th ey heated the bed  oh, God, it 
was cold.  They heated the be
d with an old First World War 
canteen, metal one filled   
Q:  No, I need to __+   
A:  So, anyway that's  why  oh, by the way, 
when we moved to Sea
ttle, and we moved to 
the house, my  father said okay, now th at you'
re Jewish, youbetter go 
to  religious school.  
So he  he made me go to temp le __ Sunda
y school.  Well, now you don't have a very 

Interv iew with El

21 
good time in Su nday  school if your parents d
on't belong to the temp le.  So  and I didn't 
have the right clothes and I started going to  Su
nday  school at the age of probably 11 or 
12, I don't know, 11, maybe.  And I didn't 
k n ow any Hebrew.  And by that time those 
kids had all learned stuff.  And teachers c
ouldn't understand why I was so stupid.  And it 
wasn't a very good experience.  So I rememb
er after awhile, I had to take the bus to 
Sunday school and I would take the bus, and 
I would not get off at Sunday  school.  I 
would go on downtown Seattle
 and walk around a
nd watch my time and then come back 
home at the right time.  So th
at I didn't even go.  So in  high school I have not terribly 
good memories of all of that.  I was  geograp
hy, I have never been terribly good at math, 
but geography and hist
ory is what I loved.  Let's see   
Q:  Do you think that has some
thing to do with the fact th
at you traveled so much?   
A:  Probably .  I don't know but, you know, my
 brother was, like I sa
id, this incredibly 
intelligent kid and he  when my
 father did buy a car in Sea
ttle, andEric taught himself 
how to fix cars.  And long befo
re he was able to drive, old enough to drive, he was a 
night manager  then it was a McKale's gas sta
tion.  McKale's doesn't exist anymore, but it 
was a chain.  Here was this kid who  no
t old en ough to  drive but he was the night 
manager of a gas station.  The house that we
 bought was built at th
e turn of the century, 
and still had gas lamps up in the attics.  And my
 brother rewired things
 so that we have 
lights and stuff.  And so my mother  I would  
my father used  it was awful.  My father 
used the phone fo r business.  And if I had a 
date  boys could call, 
and he'd  say I'm busy, 
boom.  And I rememb er threatening my father 
once.  I said if you don't let me  use the 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
22 
phone, I will call the phone company and tell 
them you're using it for business instead of, 
you know, a home phone.  He 
looked at me like who th e hell are you, you know? That's 
why I left.  I was never home.  And when Ar
t moved into the houseboat, I was there most 
of the time.  But my mother  
I remember when I  of course 
my brother was in the service 
for a short time, and then he started college, too.  Bu t my mo m taught  was going to  teach 
me how to drive. 
Q:  Your mother, right? 

A:  Yeah, I never was close to my dad, my mo
ther, yeah .  And one day Eric's friend, Ted, 
who used  to wo rk on cars with him who lived  
on the street, saw us.  And when Eric came 
home, he said I saw your sister.  Your mo m is 
teaching her to driv e.  Oh, he blew up.  He 
told my mom in no uncertain terms that if you 
continue to teach Eleanor how to driv e, I 
won't fix the cars anymore. 
Q:  I'm sorry.  I missed it.  Was 
it your brother who said this?   
A:  My brother because he was th
e one who kept everything going. 
Q:  And he just wanted to be the 
one who is only allowed to drive? 
A:  Yeah, he didn't want me to screw things up or whatever. 
Q:  I see.  I thought that 
you guys were really close. 
A:  Well, we did    
Q:  You and your brother. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
23 
A:    just for a while, when we were alone in
 England, but, no, Eric
 could do everything 
better than I could.  And he was  so anyw
ay, I didn't learn how to drive until I had two 
children but, yeah, I have never forgiven  him fo
r that, to tell you th e truth.  I told his kids 
that.  They couldn't believe it.  But he was ki
nd of a difficult father
 when he raised his 
own kids, my  brother was. 
Q:  Your brother. 
A:  He has really mellowed no
w.  But, yeah, very
 much like our father, the apple doesn't 
fall far from the tree. 

Q:  Well, it's either like that or comp
letely opposite, just like you are, right?  
A:  Umhum. 
Q:  You said that you raisedyour children completely opposite. 
A:  Oh, yeah.  One of his 
daughters, he threw out of th e house, my  brother did. 
Q:  Umhum.   

A:  She came back.  But she wa
s into drugs and this stuff and had an abortion.  No, I was 
a super mom, I was th e girl scout leader, a
nd the boy scout volunteer.  And I volunteered 
for the  all of the sports team
s.  And I went to every base
ball game.  And I was the room 
mother in school. 
Q:  In school, umhum. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
24 
A:  The PTA president.  And 
I volunteered in the health clin
ic and all of that.  But I 
thought my kids were the 
absolute most fantastic thing in the world.   
Q:  That's  good.  
A:  And see, you know, and my  husband said 
he always resented the fact that the kids 
came first.  And so I probably wasn't the greates
t wife, but I said, yeah, I said, they didn't 
ask to be born, and my  kids always came first. 

Q:  Did you ever co
nfront your mo ther? 
A:  Yes, she denied everything.  I tried, but 
it was hopeless.  And since my  father died so 
early, I would only make her unhappy.  And 
she depended on me.  And she adored my  
children, and she adored my husba
nd after she learned to know him. 

Q:  That he could play
 bridge really well. 
A:  Oh, yeah.  And so by nine
  we got marrie d  in 1950, and those early years we lived 
way out.  Oh , I  we were both going to  colle
ge when we were engaged, and I found a 
place  he was busy.  He was going to school
, Art was, and he was 
working at Boeing on 
the fields.  So he never had any time to look 
for an apartment or anything.  I found an 
apartment.  It was $55 a month.  It was on 
the top floor of an old wooden building in  
Seattle.  And I paid the rent for the first period.
  And I think we were 
pretty happy.  What 
happened was  I remember   
well, the Korean war broke out
 very shortly after we got 
married.  A nd Art was in the Navy reserve.  H e
's a Pearl Harbor survivor.  I don't know if 
I mentioned that. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
25 
Q:  No, you haven't. 
A:  Yeah, Pearl Harbor survivor.  Married a 
Holo caust survivor an d 
Art  I told him, I 
said, I don't want to be alone.  I me an, here I 
was starting this new family in my  new life, 
you know.  And I was never happy as a child. 
 And so  we were pretty happy together.  
And I said I don't want to be alone.  I want
 to get preg nant.  And he said you're too 
young, and I said yeah, but you'r e not.  He was 
29.  And so I did.  I got pregnant on __. 
And so by th at time, he graduated.  And he
 transferred from being 
an inspecto
r on the 
field to being engineer.  He took a big wage cut. 

Q:  Cut? 

A:  Cut in those days.  Yeah.  Qu ickly wo rk ed
 out but  so I got pregnant.  And I was still 
working at the hospital at that time b
ecause I could walk back and forth.   

And then Boeing  his papers came.  We knew 
being chief radarman in the navy, that he 
would be called back.  And Bo eing said we 
need him more than th
e Navy.  So Art  I 
reme mb er s ay i ng  well, I 'm g o i ng  
to lose my reserve statu s and 
any benefits that I'll have.  
And I said I don't care.  I'm not going to be 
alone here.  You're not going in  the service.  
And he didn't want to go an yway.  So he left
 the reserves and worked as an engineer for 
Boeing fo r 38 years.  And we liv
ed in the third floor in that
 apartment.  And I remember 
coming home on a very hot day in Ap ril.  A
nd I was huffing and puffing, trying to  get up 
those stairs and I was exhauste
d.  And Art was always working.  And by that time Boeing 
was gearing up for the war.  He was always 
work ing late.  And I layed down  on the bed 
exhausted, and my  water broke
.  And I called my  mo m and sh
e took me to the hospital 

Interv iew with El

and then  finally Art came.  And so Steve was bor
n.  And then I was  
I said I have worked 
all of my  life and gone to school, one baby is
 not enough to keep me busy.  I was bored.  
So I said I wanted an other baby.  And of co ur
se I said you're nuts, 
but okay.  So we had 
another one, 22 months apart and just before 
 while I was pregnant with the second one, 
some friend of ours found an ap artment for us, 
which was a lower duplex in an area that 
was already pretty much going black, but 
not comp letely.  And it was very reasonably 
priced.  The lady just wanted some nice 
people on the lower floor.  It was a big 
apartment.  And we moved there and I didn't  
have to go three flight
s anymore.  And we 
lived there very happily, and we had friends.  
And I remember that there was a really old 
lady who lived upstairs, and she was very nice. 
 We didn't see her often.  And while I was 
in the hospital having Brian, she died. 
Q:  Was this your second ch ild, right, Brian?  
A:  Yes.  She died, and Art cam
e to the hospital.  In those da
ys, you stayed 
in the hospital 
for several days, you know. 
Q:  Right. 

A:  And so she wanted whitey 
 oh, no, no, no, she sold it to
 black people, and she wanted 
whitey out right now.  No, the bl
ack people wanted it.  They  di
dn't give us any time.  And 
so my father  I  of course I couldn't driv
e with a brand new baby, but my  oldest child 
would stay with my  mo ther.  I had the baby. 
 And my  father said we'l l have to go house 
hunting.  And by that time, we had been  
saving so me money, and for a down  payment 
you could get houses on the GI bill, and we
 drove way out, whic
h was considered in 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
27 
those days really way out.  And we found 
a house that I liked.  And I came home and I 
told Art, and the next day he 
had off.  We went out there.  And there were houses that 
were upstairs and down stairs and all on one 
floor.  Well, we didn't  have enough money 
for the down payment fo
r the one  what do you call it, 
all on one floor.  But we bought 
the one with an upstairs.  It wa
s fairly steep.  And my  father
 had a fit.  By that time, you 
know, he says I had two little boys, and he sa
id you can't have the upstairs, it will be 
hotter  terribly hot in th e summe
r, and the boys will fall down
 the stairs, you just can 't do 
that.  How  why did you buy that?  And so 
Art says well, we didn't have enough money 
for the all on one floor.  Ho
w mu ch  do you need?  And he gave us some money 
immediately.  Go out and ch ange it. 
Q:  Really? 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  Well, that was nice of him. 
A:  Yes, go out and changed it.  He adored
 my  boys and he kind of mellowed over the 
years and so we went out an
d bought the one all on one fl
oor.  And my  parents, they 
would like  as my boys got older, they took th
em each at one  one at a time on little trips 
to Mount Rinear or some lake 
or something for a little h ike.   

And by that time  Steve told me
 this recently, my father wa
s already quite weak with his 
heart problem.  And he said, he would s
it on the bench somewhere while mo m and my  
son would go hiking around.  So
 he has those good memo ries, 
and so does Brian, but my

28 
daughter was younger, Audrey, and so Dad died 
in 1958.  And the strange thing is that I 
had three ch ildren.  And right after Dad died, 
I found out I was pregnant, and I was pretty 
upset.  I didn't want to have anymore kids.  
But then all of a sudd en I thought oh, maybe, 
you know, you get this 
crazy idea, maybe God meant for th
is child to make up for your 
dad dying.   
Q:  Right.  
A:  So  because by that time 
we had moved to a bi
gger house and we had a dishwasher.  
And I had three children in school, and I got pr
egnant again, but I just  I talked about 
abortion, but my  mo ther  my  husband said ab
solutely no.  So anyway  I had Jo Dean, and 
she turned out to be 
the most wonderful little 
girl in the world. 
Q:  Is this the daughter that wasn 't  here?  
A:  No, she's the older daughter. 
Q:  She's the older daughter. 
A:  JoDean is the one with 
all of the long hair there. 
Q:  She's the blond hair one, right? 

A:  Well, she lightens it, yes. 

Q:  So you have right now    
A:  Two boys and tw o girls. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
29 
Q:  I have a photograph here, two boys and tw
o girls, right, very  good looking children.  
So it seems that your mother and father were 
actually better grandparents to your children 
than they were parents. 
A:  Very mu ch so.  And I th
ought about that, and I actually
 kind of resented that, you 
know.  And I thought  th
ey never were that close to me, 
you know.  But I got over it.  I 
didn't  let it bother me too mu ch  because I was 
too busy  having all of those kids, and after 
the war, you know, you had cooperative  play 
groups, and I was alwa
ys involved with the 
kids and baseball teams.  And I went to all of the games.  Four kids 
kept me plenty busy, 
yeah.   
Q:  I'm sure they did. 
 I'm sure they did.  
A:  Yeah.  So actually my father  I felt he wa
s pretty pathetic as he
 got older because he 
was a broken man.  He lost his profession.  He 
lost his station, his status in the world.   
Q:  Right.  

A:  And it was hard.  I understand that now, 
but a young person th inks
 only of himself.  
So life just progressed and I  oh, when I was 
in the hospital having Au
drey, that 's the one 
that was here, Art  I remember th ere was a 
congregation, a reform congregation that was 
just starting up, and a lot of young couples w
ith children.  And Ar
t came to the hospital 
and said now you're going 
 we had talked about it.  You're
 going to have to make up your 
mind.  I was very ambivalent about Judaism, 
et cetera.  And we had our Christmas tree 
still.  And Art told me, he said 
if we're going to join this te
mple, I want to be one of the 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
30 
original memb ers.  And we have to do it 
right now because they're signing th e charter.  
And I was  I had just had Audrey .  And I said 
okay, do wh at you want.  And so we joined  
the temple and we were very active.  It wa
s a lovely time.  Art taught Sunday school.  
And he didn't know a whole lo
t, but he learned fast.   
Q:  So he also didn't come from 
a religious family, 
you would say.   
A:  Well, Art's father was  he
 knew a lot, but he was one step ahead of the czar.  And he 
came to the United States at the 
turn of the century.  And ther
e were five brothers.  They 
had a stolen passport, and the story I got 
was the first one would come and send the 
passport back.  And I found out many, many 
years after I married him that his family 
name was actually Polits (ph).  And it came
 f r o m so mewh ere in  Po la
nd originally, but he 
was in Russia, and he was a communist, very 
mu ch so.  But also they had programs and 
he was Jewish, and so they wo
uld send the passport 
back and forth.  And the name on the 
passport was Rabalovitch (ph) wh
ich turned  out to be Rafalov
itch (ph) so when   and they 
all stayed in the east whereas Art's father 
got on the railroad and wo rked  his way west 
and settled into Tacoma, Washington, which is
 30 miles from Seattle, and that's where 
Art grew up.  And when I was not married yet, 
I was still engaged.  At one time I went to 
see  to Tacoma and Art's sister had done 
very well or husband was in the jewelry 
busin ess, and th ey had quite a bit of money. 
 And so Julia Rolfe from New York  came to 
visit my sister in law.  And she called me a
nd you have to come and 
meet her.  And I said 
Rolfe?  And she said oh, yes, 
the New York part of the fam
ily all ch anged their name to 
Rolfe.  And I said well, I don't want to be 
Rafalovitch (ph) I told Art.  I said get your

eanor Rolfe 
 
31 
name changed.  I want to  
you know, on your degree, he wa
s still in school.  And on our 
marriage license, we'r e going to
 be Ro lfe.  Art had never 
known there was a New Yo rk 
family. 
Q:  Really? 
A:  Yes.  There were quite a few.  And it's
 really interesting.  
Bu t anyway , we changed 
our name to Ro lfe.  And my  ch ildren are very
 happy.  They  would never have liked that 
name.  Anyway it wasn't a family  name. 

Q:  It's hard to spell, yeah. 

A:  Rolfe is a nice name.  But that's how we 
got that name, and it's an English name and 
people always ask are you relate
d to so and so Rolfe? No.  
So that was done before we 
got married.  And I was thinking of some
thing, but the thought just left me. 
Q:  Oh, we were talking about y
ou becoming more religious, right?  
A:  Oh, yeah.  We joined the 
temple and Steve went to Sunday
 school and he came home.  
We joined the temple in May a
nd that  that December, Steve 
 my son is very adamant.  
He gets that from his dad, I guess.  He said
 we can 't have a Christmas tree.  That is 
making fun of Christian symbols.  And Brian 
was really angry.  He liked the Christmas 
tree.  From that day on we di
dn't h ave a Christmas tree. 
Q:  Making fun of Christian symbols? 

A:  Yes. 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
32 
Q:  The Christmas tree? 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  You mean that this is a 
Pagan symbol after all, right?  
A:  Yeah.  Well, how old was Steve?  Was 19 
the winter of 1956.  He had ju st started 
religious school.  And the teacher said, yo
u know, we don't have Christmas tr ee s so 
naturally  I know that Brian resented that.  
And I know th at when  Brian got married they 
always had Christmas trees.  But he didn't ma
rry a Jewish person anyway.  Steve  what 
Steve said kind of was the law.  So we 
were really Jewish.  But I didn't have a 
background.  So I didn't know all of the prayers and everything. 
Q:  Did you think that your parents also b
ecame more religious after they came to the 
states?  I understand you said that you were
 helped a little bit in
 Seattle by a Jewish 
community. 
A:  Yes.  Well, the Jewish  there were 
quite a few refugees coming ev erywhere, every 
city.  All of the Jewish communities were help
ing.  No, my father had no  no use for 
religion at all.  And, no, they never atte
nded the temp le, but they
 thought it was proper 
for me to go to Sunday school.  But my  brot
her about that time was  was beyond th e bar 
mitzvah age or just about that.  And he wasn't
 about to  get involved with that.  So he was 
never made to go to  Sunday school, only I was.  

Q:  Okay . 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
33 
A:  And oh, my goodness, I think as I rememb
er, we did have a Christmas tree in  Seattle.  
And I think we used the Menorah  also because 
we had this big  we had both.  Bu t I don't 
remember very joyous Christmases.  My 
mo ther was befriended by a lot of Quakers 
when we first came to the Un
ited States in Seattle.  And 
there was one wonderful thing 
that I remembered to this 
day, the Quak ers had on New 
Year's, they had New Year's 
callers. 
Q:  New Year's callers, what's that? 

A:  New Year's callers.  And ev ery New Year
's a different family would host, and they 
usually had about five or six homes that were
 hosts.  And the New Ye
ar's callers  it was a 
fairly large group would go to
 all of them, one after another and talk and enjoy the new 
year and then go to the next New Year's calle
rs.  And I understand they do th at in Canada 
today. 
Q:  I see. I never heard of that. 
A:  It was very lovely.  And my mother ha
d these Quaker friends. 
 She belonged to the 
"Jewish club of Wash ington," 
a bunch of German Jews.  
And every once in a while I 
would meet some of these people or I woul
d go with her, and I vowed that I was never 
going to marry a German Jew  
Q:  Why is that? 
A:  I didn 't like them.  I don'
t know.  It was very typical, children should be seen and not 
heard.  Very arrogant.  I mean
, totally opposite of the way I 
looked at having children.  I

mean, they were the greatest thin
gs ever that I ever created.
  I thought they were just 
absolutely wonderful.
  And maybe it 's because nobody 
ever thought I was wonderful.   
And so it's a really strange th
ing that Steve, when  he got 
married  he would  didn't get 
married    
Q:  Your older son, right?   
A:  My oldest son, and he didn't marry a Je
wish girl.  But Gail wa
nted to go to Nova 
Scotia for a honeymoon.  Don'
t ask me why.  She just want
ed to see Nova Scotia.  So 
Gail came from Boston and so fo r their honeymoon 
trip, th ey visited her folks, of course, 
and they  had a big wedding an
d her folks came and  but anyway  th ey went to Nova 
Scotia.  And I don't know how  I thin
k I just lost my  train of thought.

Q:  Well, you were saying that you 
didn't like the German Jews.   
A:  No, I didn't.  I didn't.  My brother had 
no religious background to speak of.  And so 
eventually  he went to Reed 
Co llege and then he got  he went to Reed Co llege, and then  
he had a scholarship to a program for gove

industry, that he represented the govern me
nt, you know, for two 
years, a noncompetition 
clause because he was the one who put all th
e emission controls on our
 vehicles.  And so 
he went to teach at Purdue Un
iversity for two years and then 
he went to work for  as a 
consultant for Mazda and Ford  
in th eir emission contro l.  And, of course, my  mother 
adored  him.  Somebody at the door? 
Q:  Yes.  There we go.   
A:  Are you on? 
Q:  Yeah, we are on.   

A:  You asked me if I became a practicing Jew.  
Q:  Right.   
A:  Well, you know, although I had no backgr
ound in Judaism,  I would do anything fo r 
my children and, yes, we joined
 the temp le.  She had just been born.  And th e boys went 
to religious school.  And it was a great group. 
 We were all young parents.  And we had a 
lot of friends there.  And we had parties, a
nd it was good.  And I learned to be Jewish.   
Q:  Did your mo ther ever go too?  
A:  No, I don't think she ever went with us to
 temple.  My father wa
s still alive.  I have 
got  that was 1956.  And then Dad died in 
'58.  And oh, about that time, we needed  a 
bigger house again.  And I remember being 
at a party and somebody said well, Ellie's 
moving and is she going to  have a dishwasher
?  And I said would she be moving without 
a dishwasher?  Because I didn't have one in 
my first home.  And it was nice.  Everybody 

Interv iew with El

36 
had their own room.  And it was a nice house. 
 And then my mother, 
of course, she was a 
widow by th en, and she took up sk
iing.  And she went to  she didn't ski very well, but she 
and her friends, they  went to Sun Valley, and 
she fell in the pool.  She told everybody it 
was on the hill, but she fell in the pool and sh
e tore all of her  I think she tore her ACL 
ligaments.  And so she was in a 
cast, and so naturally she had to
 move in with us for quite 
a while until she was healed.  
And then we had to get her 
 by that time, the house, the 
family house that I grew up in was complete
l y  surrounded by black folks.  And it was a 
different time than now, you know.  And it was 
difficult, so we insist
ed that Mom move.  
And we found her an ap artment 
in the suburbs.  And then  as the years passed by, we had 
a nice time in the house we lived in.  Lots of
 neighborhood parties. 
 We hadprogressive 
dinners and I was very happy there.  And we 
belonged to the temple
.  We belonged to a 
swim club.  We had a good life. 
Q:  So you had a very  good
 sense of community then.  
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  Really.   

A:  Very good. And all of a sudden  well, all 
of a sudden  well, we  oh, God, Art was  
started to travel, but Boeing  in Seattle
, we h ad a recession lik
e now.  And Boeing 
insisted that Art had to move to Alabama a
nd because there were no
 jobs in Seattle.  I 
remember there was a poster some
body put up, the last person 
that leaves Seattle, turn 
out the lights, yeah.  So anyway  I resisted, but I didn't have a choice.  I me an I couldn't 

support four children.  So we went to  by th
at time I was very, very 
close to my mother.  

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
37 
We all were.  And so we move
d to Alabama.  And I remember
 Art had to go in January .  
He took one car, and he flew back.  And we we
nt in June after school was out.  By that 
time we were all skiing a lot.  
And even JoDean who was really
 little, she turned
 out to be  
even today  keeps up her accred
itation as an instructor.  I re
member we drove  I drove the 
kids to ski resorts while Art was in Alabam
a.  And I had a white station wagon with 
bright red license plates
, Alabama license plates. 
Q:  Are they bright red still?  
A:  I don't know if they're bright red still, 
but they were at that 
time.  And 
people would 
look at that in the parking lot and say Alab
ama?  I said when  you live in Alab ama, you 
got to go a long way to ski. 

Q:  Certainly.    

A:  Well, you know, he could license the car a
nd then  we didn't have to buy two licenses.  
So instead of Washin gton, we 
bought Alabama.  So then 
we went to Alabama.  We 
drove, and we went by way of
 Disneyland and it was a pretty good trip.  And along the 
way, we became more affluent.  Th
e kids  the school were terrible. 
Q:  In Alabama?   
A:  Yes.  So I insisted on th e kids going to  
priv ate school.  And I had  I had  argued with  
my husband about that, but you
 see my husband is  was very
, very intelligent and he did 
very well.  He learned very well in public sc
hool because he just read all of the books 
they had, but anyway  I won and unfortuna
tely I would have had to  send Stev e to 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
38 
Birmingham because there was no priv ate high 
school and I couldn't do that yet. There 
was no way I was going to send my son to a 
different city .  And so  the three younger 
ones went to this very, very g
ood private school and it made a terrific difference.  Even  
today my  son, Brian, says that ma de me real
ize that I had some brains.  And JoDean was 
born in Novemb er.  And sh e used to say Phoe
be gets to go to  school.  She called him 
Barney  gets to go to school, Onnie (ph) gets to
 go to school.  I never get to go to  school.  
So there was no public kindergarten .  And so at
 first I put her in a basket on my  bike, and 
we went to all sorts of places
, and we had a good time.  I was alone mo st of the time in 
Alabama so  because Art was wo
rking, in New Jersey.  Boei
ng had a habit of doing that, 
but  so I decided I started her in 
private kindergarten a year earlier. 
Q:  Oh, you did start one, right, your
self?  You started one yourself?   
A:  No.  It was  there was no public kindergar
ten in Alabama.  It w as all private.  So it 
was in a church and people said aren't you asha
med of lying in church, that she's actually 
five when  she wasn't?  And I said it doesn't matter to me wh
ether I lied in church or 
anyplace else.  So she  oh, th
at was kind of interesting.  
The  by the time we w ere in 
Huntsville, Alabama, all of the German scient
ists had come there.
  Wernher von Braun 
was living in  Alabama and all of his cohorts.  I found th at very difficu lt.  They  were 
obnoxious.  I reme mb er going to th e supermarke
t, and they talked ve
ry loud in German, 
and obviously that bothered 
me, but Wernher von Braun'
s daughter was at Randolph 
School, which I said it was a very, very good pr
ivate school, and dated 
my  son, I believe.  
They went to parties together 
once, yeah, just once.  And, of course, he  Brian didn't drive 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
39 
yet in those days.  Brian has always been a 
social person.  I rememb er I would drive him 
on dates and take him places and 
pick him up.  But they were
 a lot of Germans in that 
school, weren 't there?  Umm?   
Q:  __+dating? 
A:  Oh, I had a fit probably, yeah.  Can 
you imagine?  But y
ou know the American 
government brought all of those people to our 
country, yeah.  And that's where Redstone 
Arsenal is.  I always felt that they brought us 
 they could have done 
this in other parts of 
the country, but they brought us
 northerners to the south to in
tegrate the south.  I always 
felt that.  We were being used to integrate the 
south.  It was a diffic
ult time.  I remember 
that Brian  no, Steve had to go
 to public high school.  He wa
s in the band.  And the band 
was invited to go to  play for 
Lurleen Wallace's inauguration at
  what's the name of the 
city, Audrey? 
Audrey:  __  
A:  No, no, in the coast.   

Audrey:  Mobile.   
A:  Huh huh.  
Audrey:  Mobile.  

A:  No.  I'll think of it, but 
anyway wherever they were   
Audrey:  Montgomery.   

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
40 
A:  Montgomery.  They were going to Mont
gomery and the Huntsville High School band 
was going to  play at Lurleen Wallace's inauguration.  No w, this woman was running fo r 
governor because her previous  the previo
us governor was her 
husband and he
 couldn't 
run anymore, you know, only so many terms. 
 Well, they get on a bus and Steve comes 
from the west.  He really  we never found 
any anti Semitism in the west.  I was the one 
who came from that background, but not my  
children.  They star
ted out and nobody 
would let them go to the bath
room.  I mean, the Huntsville 
High School band was mostly 
black.  It was integrated.  And that was integr
ated and that was our schools  that was the 
government, city, you know?  So
 Steve said that he learned a lot about discrimi nation. 
Q:  Really.   
A:  Interesting.  And so he never really
 felt any discrimi nation as a Jew growing up 
because we lived in the west.  
And I'm sure that the people  
you see my father refused to 
stay in New York becau se he wanted to  he
 was going be an immigrant, he wasn 't going 
to be in New York with all of
 those other Jews.  So we were assimilated and he  it was 
difficult.  When  they  got to Montgomery, they
 wouldn't even seat them.  And so the bus 
turned around and came back to Huntsv ille. 
 That was a good lesson for Steve.  
Unbelievable, though difficult times. 

Q:  Yeah, I can  difficult times.   

A:  Yeah, I mean    
Audrey:  1966.   

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
41 
A:  Yeah, that was  it's really interesting. 
 I just recently saw f
ilms about that, you know, 
they turned the hose on 
black kids that tried to go to 
school.  It was awful.  I hated 
Huntsville.  My mother came all th
e time.  We were close to my  mother in those  I mean  
she  the most important thing in
 my mother's life was her child
ren, her grandchild ren so    
Q:  People change.   
A:  Yeah.  I kind of resented that, but that's
 the way it was.  So when we lived  when  we 
first came to Huntsv ille, We liv
ed in an apartment.  We ha
d to build a house.  There 
wasn't anything there and th ere were three bedrooms, a bedroom for Art and me, 
bedroom for the boys, and a bedroom for the gi
rls, and Paula came home.  And so we had 
to walk over beds, yeah . 
Q:  __.   

A:  Yeah.  She adored 
my children, you know.  
Interesting, isn't it? 
Q:  It is interesting,
 but people do change.   
A:  People change, yes.  So I have always ki
nd of felt like I was in 
the outside looking in 
when I was supposed to be Jewish, I wasn 't
 Jewish enough.  I di
dn't have the right 
clothes.  When we came to Seattle, the coun
cil of Jewish wo men, there were a number  
you know  immigrants came west.  And th
ey had a big dinner for us, for the new 
immigrants.  And I remember lo ng tables at this
 temple.  And we went
 there and they  the 
table decorations were little figures
 like from Fiddle
r On The Roof. 
Q:  Umhum.   

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
42 
A:  In those kind of clothes.  My brother 
who was typically arrogant, like his father, took 
one look at those and, you kn
ow, depicting immigrants and th
inking oh, he says we're not 
staying.  He was just so angry.  I remember 
that.  And my father lo
oked at that, and then 
he realized that Eric said, no, I can't look at those figures, and we left.  But in those days, 
there was  people always discriminated against each other.  And there was a large 

population of Jews fro
m the Isle of Rose. 
Q:  I'm not sure where that is. 
A:  Spanish Jews, Sephardic Jews, very large 
Sephardic Jews that came in the early part 
of the 1900s and it was large.  And in 
those days if the Ashkenazic Jews, they 
discriminated against the Sephardic Jews.  I 
remember the very first  I heard a family 
actually would sit shiva if their daught
er or son married a Sepharic Jew.  
Q:  I see. 

A:  And the concept of discrimi
nation, this was just unbelievab
le in my  mind.  So at one 
time  the first year my brothe
r was at the University of Washington  he transferred the 
second year to Reed Co llege.  He was, of co
urse, on the newspaper staff.  And he wrote 
an article.  Race relations were terrible in the 
'60s.  He wrote an article in the University 
of Washington Daily.  And he wrot
e that  I think I still have the article in a file that the 
only hope for peace and happiness wa
s between the races and to get rid of this animosity 
for complete mingling of the races,
 intermarriage.  Oh, my God. 
Q:  I'm sure that   

Interv iew with El

43 
A:  Signed by Eric Stark (p
h). Our phone never stopped ringi
ng.  My parents said how 
can you write that?  Oh, my  gosh. 
Q:  I'm sure that wa
s a bit controversial. 
A:  Very controversial.  Yes.  And then
 after my  parents got used to my  marrying 
something of Ru ssian background, and they  
loved Art because he's a wonderful man. 
Q:  Is that his full name, Art? 

A:  Arthur.   

Q:  Arthur.   
A:  Arthur.  And he doesn't 
have a middle name.  They didn't  bother with middle names 
in those days.  Yeah, Arthur.  An
d  wh at was I going to say?  
Q:  You were saying that they got 
used to him being a Russian Jew.  
A:  Oh, yes.  In 1952  I got married in '50.
  In 1952, Art met Dorothy, and we heard about 
his girlfriend, that turned out to be a finace
é.  He lived here in 
Washington D.C. He was 
work ing for the govern ment.  And 
he would  he told my mo ther  none of us went to the 
wedding.  Dorothy is part American Indian.  
Q:  Umhum. 
A:  She's a wonderful woman.  And my  mo th
er told me don't you ev er, ever tell anybody 
that Doro thy has American Indian heritage. 
 I think her father wa
s white.  The mother

was, you know  she came from a family of 13 
children.  And my  brother was  at that time 
he had mo ved to the Department of Indian
 affairs.  She was a secretary there. 
Q:  So  I'm sorry becau
se I think I missed it.  So this is
 your brother who met her, right?   
A:  Yes.  And, you know, I 
told  you th at my  parents disc
riminated against my  husband 
because he had a Russian back
ground, and then the idea th
at my brother would marry 
somebody American Indian . 
Q:  Right.   
A:  Of course everybody l
oved each other in the end. 
Q:  Right.  It's just an initial obstacle. 
A:  Sure. 
Q:  Different upbringing I'm sure, too. 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  Do you think that the fa
ct that you were the Kindertra
nsport child, did th is  do you 
think that had any influence on your life? 

A:  What is that noise? 
Q:  I am afraid that apparently  somebody is having a speech. 

A:  Oh, oh.  They 're applauding
.  I think so .  I was alone.  I was alone at the age of 8.  
And I went to a foreign country  where I didn
't know the language.  And then when  I got 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
45 
to the school, I was kind of discriminated ag
ainst because they found out I had parents 
that were alive. 
Q:  And who also could 
send you the packages?  
A:  Yeah.  And I think from  that I was always
 alone and being, yeah, I was used to being 
alone and little.  I was always small.  And so
me people made lifelo ng friends when they 
were in England.  I did not.  No.  I think a
bout it.  And when at fi
rst, they talked about 
survivors.  I never thought of myself as a su
rvivor, you know, becaus
e I wasn 't  in a camp, 
but then  they  said, you know, we
 are.  Like I said, I talked to the lady who made the film, 
my knees were jumping.  That 
film was shown in the Seattle 
Jewish film festival 12 years 
ago.  I told Melissa that.  A
nd she remembered that.  It was 
shown in a large auditorium.  
And I had read in the newspaper it was going to be
 shown.  And I told Art, we got to go.  
And we went.  Have you ev er seen that film?  
Q:  No, I haven't seen that one. 
A:  In one of the pictures, it was a string of
 girls dancing and I said
, Art, there's __. He 
says, yeah, because my father had taken 
so many pictures.  He
 was, you know, a 
photographer.  I mean, he took pictures of ever
ything.  And so  we had a lot of pictures of 
me as a little girl.  So Millis Hacker (ph) as
ked if there was anybo
dy in the audience who 
came on the Kindertransport.  And I raised 
my  hand.  And I was the only one.  And 
afterwards I ran down because we were quite 
a ways up.  And I talked to her.  And she 
told me about KT A.  I had no id ea.  Living
 in the west I had 
no idea there was an 
organization  I didn't  have any Jewish conne
ctions except the temple.  And so Melissa 

Interv iew with El
eanor Rolfe 
 
46 
told me about the internationa
l KT A Association.  And she to
ok my  name.  And within a 
week or so, I got stuff in the mail fr
om Kindertransport.  Now there was no 
Kindertransport group in  Seattle, but there was 
 it's  a group of child 
survivors, you know.  
I got to go to  the bath room. 
Q:  Oh, let's pause. 
A:  Are you done?  {Recess} Yeah, my father, 
when I moved  when my  mo ther died, we 
moved boxes and boxes of pape
rs to our house.  And when
 we down sized two years ago 
to a retirement community, I started going thro
ugh all of our papers 
and one  my  son in 
law, Audrey's husband, is very interested
 in that.  And he 
so meti me s co mes fro m 
Colorado and he goes through stuff.  He 
finds it amazin g.  And my grandson  one 
grandson is living in   Freiburg, Germany 
and he graduated with three degrees from  
my  family has done very well in
 the United States, very well.  My brother was high up in 
the American government, and his daught
er  one daughter was in charge of 
communications for the Library of Congress.  Sh
e was head of that.  And the other one is 
involved with  her husband in
 co ntracting and has done very
 well.  And so my  oldest 
grandson is a geophysicist, and an amazing pe
rson.  And they'r e lovely children.  I was 
with my  daughter every time she had a baby
, and so I'm close to her boys.  And the 
middle one graduated with a degree in Germ
an and applied physics and in math from 
Trinity University where he ha
d a full scholarship.  And now 
he is in Freiburg working 
on his master's.  And the young
er one, like I said, is at A merican University, and my 
daughter just went to pick him up at the metro st
ation.  They 'l l be here shortly.  So  but

anyway, my  son in law and Mark have been
 going through my father's papers.  He 
work ed trying to  get other people who were st
randed in different countries to get them in 
the United States.  They were in Bo rneo .  
I don't know wh ere all, you know.  And I have 
all of those letters.  He actually contacted 
somebody from Sear's Ro
ebuck who apparently 
had some connection somewher
e because I found letters fro
m them where he asked for 
money, an d they always gave it to him to send
 to these people to ge
t them into the United 
States. 
Q:  Our museum might be interested in such
 papers if you would 
be willing to sh are. 
A:  Yeah.  I have to check.  Now, Mark just 
made copies.  I have a  what do you call it?  
It's actually  a book written on __+ typed, and very 
close together.  And it's  my cousin 
living underground with her hu
sband in Belgium.  And it's 
written in German, so I  my 
German isn't good en ough for th at. 

Q:  Uh huh. 
A:  And I have that and unfo
rtunately I didn't check to find 
out if she was alive until after 
she died.  And they even
tually came to the United States, 
settled in Florid a, and were in 
the antique busin ess and died in  the very la
te '80s.  And at that time I was too busy 
raising kids, and I never really thought of l
ooking into  it, but I have her book that she 
wrote.  And I have in teresting stuff.  I don't k n
ow if anybody would be interested in photo 
albums. 
Q:  I'm sure they will.

A:  My parents did a lot of 
mountain childing.  And Mom to
ld me about wh
en they went 
to Pomp eii for a trip, the guid
e said  the woman cab looked down there but, yeah.  I have 
since traveled some.  And it happened that  
you asked me about my  Uncle Walter, he was 
sent then to Amsterdam to be with all of 
the other Itingers (ph) that had moved to 
Amsterdam, and wh en the news came that 
they would all be deported  and sent to 
Westerbork, one of th e uncles or something 
sent  realized that Walter would never 
survive if they were sent
 to a concentration camp. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  And so he had some money, and he lo
oked for someone who would take him in and 
shield him.  And so there was an actress  unf
ortunately, I don't have these names anymore 
in my  mind, but anyway  in the last many years I spent a lot of time going back  and fo rth 
to Holland because what happene
d was the money was given to 
 Audrey may be able to 
get the name.  I can 't seem to get the name in
to my mind.  It will co me back.  And he was 
at that time a very young man.  He becam
e a famous movie producer in Holland.  And 
what he did was he took the 
money and killed my uncle and th
rew him in the canal in a  
in a suitcase.  And th ey found him and the  it
's an interesting story.
  The first policeman 
on the case, on the scene, was a  part of th
e resistance movement, and he would go out in 
the fields.  And I met all of these people in
 Ho lland because they're not Jews.  And befo re 
this grandfather died, I did meet him.  And 
he would pick up the 
weapons that the British 
dropped out in the fields.  An
d he would pick them up and pu
t them underneath the baby 
carriage with the baby on top and bring them to
 the priest who was collecting weapons.   

Interv iew with El

Q:  I see.  
A:  Really trying to get a 
resistance going, but it didn't work
, of course, but  so he was 
aware of  he was a first  he was a policeman 
in Amsterdam.  And he was the first one on 
the scene.  And he always knew that Walter 
was mu rdered.  And anyway , he tried very 
hard to get this man convicted, and he just sp
ent maybe a few months of jail, and th at was 
it.   
Q:  That was it.   
A:  Well, the baby in the baby carriage was 
told that, you know, y
ou have to fo llow up on 
this case.  And I have a book ab out it.  It's 
all in Dutch th ough.  And you have to bring 
him to justice.  And so she ev
entually died of cancer.  And 
as she was dying in the last 
days, she told her son, Peter, th
at you have to follow this up fo
r me and work on it.  And I 
guess it was something the whole family always knew.   
Well, Peter Crowson th en started his search and 
he  he's  an archivist in Amsterdam.  He 
has now been promoted.  He is now the head  
archivist in Amsterdam.  But at that time, 
there were some writers who were looking into 
this murder also.  It made a hell of a good 
story.  And so this author apparently came to
 the archives and talked
 to Peter and wanted 
some information.  And eventu
ally they got together and he
 convinced Peter, although it 
was difficult for him because it would have been
  he could have gotten fired, but anyway 
to join him in th
is search and

A:  Peter was just the son of this
 lady who was in the baby carriage.

And it was something that they wanted to

take care of your property and 
your money.  And wh en you co

Those that came back, never heard of you.   
Q:  Right.  
A:  He was a crook.  Bu t anyway , he even trie
d to get a pension as a resistance person.  
And, of course, he was never  he was turned 
down , and he sued people.  And Peter is the 
man who  finally he couldn't  get anymore in
formation about Walter and his family.  So 
he searched the Internet.  A
nd he searched the name Itinge
r (ph) which is my mother's 
maiden name.  And there were lots of Itingers 
(ph) because it's a Catholic name.  So a lot 
of people said, never heard of it.   

One person, and it was my  cousin's daughter
 who was wo rking as a journalist in the 
Colo rado mountains for a local newspaper, re
sponded to him and sa
id I think I know 
what you'r e talking about.  She called her 
dad.  And her dad called me .  And it was

coincidental that was in January  of 1901.  
And I had made  I was invited to go back to 
Hamburg, you know, in 
the visitation program. 
Q:  1901? 
A:  Excuse me. 
Q:  2001, right? 
A:  2001.  And then I went 
to Hamburgh, and I had to ld 
Audrey  they let me b ring 
somebody and I wanted you to come because Ar
t said that he  what was the purpose of 
him learning all of this?  Audrey  will share 
it with the family, 
you know.  Pass it down, 
besides Audrey and I have always been close.
  And I didn't have the greatest marriage. 
Q:  Can you excu se me for a second?  I just 
rememb ered that I need 
to __+ yes.  { Recess 
} Let's record.  There we go. 

A:  I'd like to share this w
ith someone from the Holocaust ce
nter eventually because it's 
an interesting story.  They traced us, and my
 cousin, Peter, actually
 forbade me to go see 
these people.  He said what do
 they want from us?  Do they 
want money?  He was always 
suspicious.  Well, Peter Crowson is a man who 
I had a gut feeling that he was honest.  He 
wrote to me many, ma ny e mail letters.  And so
 we were in Hamburgh.  And I agreed for 
him to come and meet us.  And he was goi
ng to drive to Hamburgh with his Arthur 
friend, and they were going to 
drive us back to  Amsterdam a
nd actually he invited us to 
stay with him.  My cousin, 
Peter, was livid and he said yo
u can't d o  this.  And I'm like 
don't tell me what to do, but 
anyway this was amazing.  So
 since 2001 over the years

we'v e gotten to know th e person.  And I've done many trips back to  Amsterdam.  And 
Audrey has come with me on a couple.  My  on e grandson was studying in Delft, which is 
right next to Amsterdam.  And it's  become 
a home away from home.  It's just amazing.  
And we actually got this man convicted. 
Q:  Oh, very good. 
A:  Yeah.  Actually  well, he's very old now,
 but what we tried to do was clear the record 
so that people would know wh
at an awful person he was.  
He said he was a resi stance 
helper.  He never was.  He took money from Je
ws before they were sent to the camps and 
said he would save it for them and, of course , he never got it back.  Artwork  he actually 
to this day is living in a home that came
 from a wealthy Jew  And my daughter will 
probably remember.  F o r some reason I have 
a total block now.  But I have talked to 

authors and journalists in Amsterdam.  A
nd we 'v e comm unicated and it took us a long 
time.  Peter, who is  when we write to Pete
r and his wife  now, like I said, they 'r e like 
family because they  I 
told him my   Aaron is coming to  
Delft, and you're going to love 
him, and like Peter didn't tell me at the time. 
 He said what does she think, I'm going to  
love this American kid?  And then  afte
rwards, you know, Ellie, you're right, I love 

Aaron.  They 're so clo se.  So Peter, they 
had a baby.  I met them
 longbefore she was 
even pregnant.  And Aurora is six now 
and  their little girl is called Aurora. 
Q:  Whose child is that?  
A:  Peter's.  And I had invited 
th em because I've stayed with them so often in  Amsterdam.  
And I said you got to come to America.  And 
so they came in July
.  And th ey came and

they spent a week with 
Audrey  in Co lorado.  And they ca
me and spent a week with me in 
Seattle in Bellevue.  Then they went down to
 Huntington Beach which is very close to 
Disneyland.  And th ey 
spent a week with my son, Brian.
  And he drove them back and 
forth.  And they wanted to st
ay in Disneyland Hotel one ni
ght.  And they
 came back to 
Brian.  And then they flew b
ack to Audrey's h ouse in Colora
do.  They just had the most 
wonderful time in the Un
ited States.  And like I said, we 
have a family in Amsterdam.  
They are, of course, not Jewish, but we love
 each other dearly.  An
d we met through this 
case.  And it's  this man is 
 of course, he's a liar, and he 
was very famous.  And the thing 
that he was trying to  fight was that his name
, you know, we wanted  him to be known for 
what he was.   
Q:  I could certainly understand that, a
nd when you rememb er the name, you can just 
simply e mail it because we ar
e going to record it.   

A:  I thought Audrey was coming back.  I 
just can 't remember. 
 I noticed about six 
months ago that I was having trouble with reme
mb ering especially names.  And so I think 
this is part of the aging process. 

Q:  Don't worry about that.  We can definitely include it.   
A:  Yeah.  

Q:  Once you su pply that name in
 the record that you mentioned. 
A:  And the  I have the book.  It's in Du
tch.  And I'm sure somebody at the Holocaust 
Center can read it.  And 
I could send you th e book.
