DR. JACQUES GODEL 
August 28, 1995 
QUESTION:  Wh ere you were bo
rn.  Date of birth.    
ANSWER:   My na me  is  Jaques  Gode l.  I wa s bor n 
October  the  9th, 1924, i n
 Pa ris,  Fra nc e .    
Q:  Tell me a little bit about yo
ur family -- your 
fa mily and your life 
befo re the war.  
A:  My father was born in Roma
nia  in 1894 a n d he l e ft Roma ni
a i n 1910.  An d on his wa y to 
Ameri ca he stopped in Paris and stayed t here. 
 And after Wo rld Wa r I -- 
he was in the Frenc h  
For eign Le gion during World War  
I -- he went  bac k t o Roma nia , 
ma rri ed my  mo th er, t oo k her  to 
Paris.  And so I was born in Pari s,
 my  sister was born i n Par i s.  
And before the war,
 li fe was -- the 
life of Jewish immigrants
 in France -- tolerated.  I wouldn't sa
y affluent, but well-to-do.  Until the  
recession.  And we di dn't 
have maj or pr ob
lems in ter ms of intol eran
ce and suspi cion of bei ng a 
forei gner unt il really the mi d -- lat e
 30's .  Ver y, very s hortl y before 
t he wa r.  Very  sh
or tly.  And t ha t  
came about, of course, with               in
 Ger ma ny.  And a --  the  begi nni ng of, or ma ybe t he re ne wal  
of French Nationalism,  which was very strong during
 the Dr eyfus (ph.) busine
ss .  Of cour se, I wa s  
not ther e.  My father was not there either , but
 we kne w a lot  of pe opl e 
who lived through those  
time s, and I believe th
at was the seed of wh
at we felt after that.  That 
Dreyfus business was -- is still  
very i mportant in France, but in 
the 30's, Dreyfu s was still alive, of
 course.  The controversy around 
his na me  wa s rea lly 
the trigger for the Fr
ench Nationalism.  
Q:  Did you live in a 
J e wi sh communit y, or  were
 you nece ssaril y  inte grat ed into t he ge nera l --  
A:  No, we never -- we never li
ved i n a - -  well , t he J e wish c o
mmunity in Paris was 
essentially the    
          
, that's -- that is on the ri
ght bank of Paris near the Hotel         
      there, that's
 where you fi nd a ll the  
kosher butchers, and where you bu
y your matzo fo r Pesa
ch and where they 
have the traditional  
synagogues and 
so forth.   
But other than that area, the Jews 
were kind of scattered 
until the 30's or so, when
 they started to get 
together in           
    and the Follies Be
rgere, yes.  But, no
, we were scattered.  
We  were scattered.  
Q:  Wa s your fa mily religious?

A:  No.  No.  No. 
 Just like so ma ny Je wi sh fa mili es be
fore the war, religio
n wa s not -- all our  
fri ends -- rel i gion wa s not an i mport a nt -- well , we -- young peopl e woul d be -- yes -- r espe ct it, but  
we woul d get gi fts a t  Christ ma s.  And we had br
ead for Pesach.  We had 
matzo and bread at the 
sa me t i me on t he t able .  We  at e por k.   

So we were very             .  And all our fr
iends were the same.  But we -- culturally, we were very , 
very Jewish.  Very Jewish.  
There were still many Jewish activ
ities going on in 
Paris and very  
strong Yi ddish theater.  An d 
we gre w up with t h at.   

The r e wer e five or si x sta ges wh
ere  you could go and ha
ve a nice afternoon or 
evening with Yiddish 
theater.  There wer e friends of mine who were 
Sc outs a nd t he Scout move me nt -- the J ewi sh Scout  
move me nt .  The r e wer e Zionist gr oups.  Ther e were 
Soci alist groups , part of 
more or less the Bund . 
And so r eligi on wa s not very i mport
ant and that al ways wa
s a  poi nt of frict i on whe n my gra ndfathe r  
visite d fr om Roma ni a.  He wa s ve
ry religi ous .  I t  wa s al wa ys a po
int of friction with my fa mily, 
beca use  he wa nte d a  ko
sher plat e and couldn't  
fi nd it, you know.  
Q:  Did you go to school with the Fren
ch Catholics?  Did 
you mi x socially?  
A:  Oh, I -- I went t o 
school -- my fi rst sc
hool -- my -- my -- 
wa s ki nde rgarten.  That wa s with t he  
nuns.  And what, about th
ree, t hree and a hal f, or
 fo ur.  And my sister 
was bor n a nd wa s re ally a 
nuis anc e s o I  we nt t o s chool .  And wa s ve
r y good beca use  I ne ede d 
the             
 .  And then after that 
I we nt to public sc hool.  We ha d no discri mination-- was not beaten by the other kids be caus e I wa s  

Jewish.  They never -- ne
ver sai d a nyt hing.  No, we were  nor m al ki ds .  
Q:  Did you play with them?   

A:  Oh , yes.  Oh, yes. 
 Ye s.  And t he y played 
with me and -- sure.   
Q:  Wh at wa s -- um -- what 
was your father's  business?  
A:  He ha d a busi nes s of int erior dec oration.  Pa
inting, wallpaper and -- but on a large scale in the 
30's.  He would r e-do mo vi
e t heat ers, and small  factor
ie s a nd s t uff li ke t hat wi
th deadlines 
so he had 
to wor k at ni ght wit h a l a rge gr
oup of people.  And they were Ru
ssia n --  Rus sian i m mi gr ants , those

people, who were all first cousin
 of the Czar , of c our se , you k
now.  So it was c ol or ful , it wa s  
color ful .  That was , you know
, until -- until the   
            
of '35- '3 6.  That wa s the turning point.  
Q:  Can we just 
ask you another ques
tion?  You ha
d mentioned Jewish 
cultural and political  
activities.  Wh ere you or y
our  fa mil y  invol ved in the m
?   We re  you Zi oni sts ?   
A:  No.  No.  No.  No. 
 We -- we -- just like all the Jewish 
fa mi l y we had the  blue piggy bank of the  
where we woul d put money in it a nd so
mebody from the               would come once a month and 
collect t hat and t hat would suppor
t -- that woul d support 
Israel -- Palest ine at
 the time.  And we 
were getting a Jewish paper,              .  But that -- that was the extent of it -- was the extent.  Just -- 
just having fa mily me mbers and 
fri ends with the sa me  ba ckground
 that was our --
 that was the 
exte nt of our  Je wis hness .    
 

Q:  You ha d me ntione d, a l
so, Russia n i mmi gra nts.   
Was ther e a difference i n the way French -- traditi
ona lly Fr e nch Je ws -- vers us i m mi grant s fr om 
other  --  from Ea ster n Eur ope
 were treated in France?  
A:  Oh, t hos e Rus sia ns i m mi gra nts were 
--  were  --  none  of
 the m are  Je wi sh.  
Q:  Oh.  Oka y.  I  mis unde rstood.  

A:  Oh, t he y  were not  --  oh, no, 
no.  I  beli eve  ma ybe one  was  J ewi sh. 
 I'm not sure.  
But all the rest 
of them were -- were -- I don't k
now if they were -- they were -- the White Russians.  Yes.  They 
wer e counts, and were r e ally a fu
nny bunch of pe ople .  
But they were good wo
r kers so my fat her  
hired them.    

Q:  So in the 30
's when Hitler 
came to power, how awar
e were you of what
 was going on in 
Ger ma n y?   We re t her e r e fu
gees co ming int o Pari s?  
A:  The refugees started t o come 
in '38.  Most of the refugees that
 we sa w wer e  fro m Austria .  And I 
reme mb er one of them -- wh ose na
me  was Godel a l so -- a nd he ca me 
to see us and my father helped 
hi m.  And we got i n t ouc h with hi
m after the war.  He wa
s able to come here to
 the Uni t ed Stat es.

An d we lo st  track o f hi m 
-- but -- a nd s o the y t old us what wa s goi ng on.  They t ol d us .  I don't 
re me mb er be ing  in  co
ntac t with Ger m an Je ws , but  Austria n Je ws, yes .  Yes .  
Q:  Wh at was -- what
 was your reacti
on to this?  This inform
ation you were getting?  
A:  Uh, wel l , we -- I know
 my pare nts wer e ver y, very upse t. 
 Very, ver y upset .  And we wer e  
looking at Hitler as -- as 
a danger.  But at the same
 time, being in France, 
you know, the traditional 
enemy of Ge rmany, th
e strong French Ar my.  We
 felt very secure.  Wel l, 
if they move, we're going 
to leave them and H
itler is going to go back to 
Bohemia, or wherever he 
came fr om.  That was the  
fe eling i n Fr ance .  Ver y few pe ople were 
aware of wh at happened.  Ve ry fe w.     
Q:  So  you weren't part
icularly threatened?  
A:  We  --  we  -- we  were
 not -- no -- not by th
e French, no.  No.  No .  
Q:  But by the Germans?  
A:  Ger ma n y was -- was  a dan ger 
for -- for the world.  People we
re talking about re-armament of 
Ger many and so forth, but at the sa
me ti me , we -- we -- as I say, y
ou know, we were fe e ling that we 
had t he M a ginot line pr otecti ng us , that the Fr e n
ch Ar my wa s so strong, 
that we had t he best  
weapons, and so fo rth.  And all th
at propaganda of the French gove
r n me nt, tr ying to -- not trying -- 
but -- I beli e ve the y beli e ved that, t he ms elve s, you know.  The y belie ve d that, ye s, the Magi not li ne  

wa s very st r ong, that t h e French e n gine ers wer e
 building the best tanks,
 and buil d ing the best  
airplane, and the French 
Ar my wa s i n vinci ble .   
The navy wa s the second in
 t he world, and so fort h.
  So -- and --  ye s.  
Q:  Wh en did you 
learn different ly?  
A:  At the defe at of France, 1940.  

Q:  What  ha ppe ne d?   

A:  Well, when the French Ar my
 collapsed and all of a sudden 
German soldiers were invadin g  
France, that 's -- that 's when we fe
lt the i mpact of defeat . 
 An d the danger of an
 enemy of France and 
the Jews at  t he same ti me.  So -- 
so we were t hreatened on t w o aspect
s.  So it wa s rea l
l y a feeling of  
total de spair  and fea r all  of a sudde n.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349

All of a sudden.  A different r
eality.  And we had to adjust
 to that different reality.  
Q:  Do  you reme mber wh en th
e  Ger m ans  oc cupied Pa ris?   
A:  We ll, we left Paris th
e 10t h of J une in 1940.  
We  were among the last to
 lea ve Pari s .  Ever ybody 
wa s leavi ng .   And -- wel l , we wer e  just o utsid e o f 
Paris in t h at place where we spent the first t wo 
years of t he war .  And t h e --  
Q:  Can you describe to
 me the Ger man occupation of Pari
s?  The initial -- 
the fi rst days.  
A:  I  was  n ot  ther e.   

Q:  Oh .  

A:  I was not there.  No, I can 
describe the German oc
cupation of Brittany -- th
e first days.  Wher e 
-- it was about the 15th or 16th of 
June and we had reached that sm
all place in Britta
ny.  Peaceful,  
beautiful medieval town with old,
 walled medieval town 
and it was beautiful,
 beautiful summer -- 
oh, spring.  And it 
was the first time that
 we reall y were out so -- that
 far f r om Paris i n  a coupl e of 
years or so.  An d it
 wa s very nice.   
Ver y, ver y nice .  Bea ut i ful la nds cape and the s mell 
of country.  An d so we
 used to walk in the 
eve ning ar ound that  --  tha t  s mall  cit y.  

Q:  Wh at's the name of the city?  

A:               .  And in the distance we coul
d see -- on the road i n the dist
a nc e -- movi ng side c ars --  
motorc ycl es.  We coul d s ee that in the dista nce .  
And we had seen very few French soldiers in the 
prece ding da ys.  There were ve ry fe w Fre nch sol di ers
 in t hat ar ea, practi call y
 none .  We r e  just a fe w 
straggler s who wer e tryi ng t o go whereve r  the y 
coul d.  And so we sa w -- 
late at night -- it was 
al most dusk -- and t he color of th
ei r uni form was strange.
  It was very strange.  So at first we 

thought they were British 
soldiers who were trying to -- to go ba
ck to Brest to -- we were told that  
the Briti sh were re-e
mbarking that area.  No, they were Germans, and it was absolutely fright ening, 
because t hey wer e -- I 'm sure t hey
 we re exhauste d.  And t he y wer e
 t wo t o a motor c yc le .  One wa s 

drivi ng a nd t he other one  was in the s i decar wit h 
a mac hi ne gun.  And the i r fac e wa s -- they were  

blonde a nd - - they wer e -- they had t h e typic al Ger m
ans.  And their face cove
red with t he  dust of t he

road -- they were looking absolute
ly -- they were awful.  They we
re raw, military power.  And o f 
cour se, I underst ood t hat  year s la
t e r,  wh en  I was  my sel f  in  th e Ar
my, t he people who are s ent l i ke  
that are the best .  The y a r e the pe opl e  who can a n alyze a sit ua tion a nd ta ke  action a nd s o forth.  So 
they pass ed by us, a nd I r e me mbe r  we  were wal kin
g by the barr acks of the Fr
ench Gendarme s and it 
wa s a hot e v ening and they ha d like a  balcony at t he barr ack
s there with the sign               and the 
fla g.  And t he wi fe of one of t he Ge ndar me s t he r
e al most collapse d.  She  
had a -- she  had a cry .  
And t he y re move d t he Frenc h fla g i m me diat ely.  
The y kne w what -- s o -- and t he y di sa ppe are d. 
And then the  next morni n
g, the ot her c a me, a nd t he y were the 
Her man Goerr ing (ph.) divi sion.  And 
they came  with big guns and we
apons and so forth.  And they st
opped to engage in conversation 
wit h u s .   An d -- I ' m sur e  they  were
 under orders t o  be ver y fri e ndl y 
-- and t hey were fri endl y.  They 
wer e frie ndl y.  One of t h e m as ked me why I wa s  not  
in t he  ar my.  And I t old 
hi m, " Well, I ' m 15."  
He said, "Well, in Germany, 15,             .  And they were very proud to be member of the Herman 
Goerring di vision.  And t hey were  tell ing 
us , Well , a we ek we 'll  
be  in Engla nd.   
And after that they left .  I don't know where th
e y we nt.  And they wer e  replace d by the regul a r  
Ger man Ar my.  That pl ace was l i ke
 an admini st rative city, so th
ey establ ished a commandant ure  
there.  But that was essentiall
y for them -- y
ou know, they -- they or
dered a curfew for the 
populati on a nd st uff like that
.  But at the same time 
they were trying to show
 to the French people 
that, Well, we are not that bad.  
And I re me mber, we st ay
ed there one mont h befo
re we wer e abl e to  
go bac k home .  And one of the  s on 
of that city wa s a Navy officer 
wh o died at Dunkirk.  And his 
body was re covered a nd wa s sent t o th
at place to be buried i n the fa
mily vault.  And the whole cit y  
came to t he funer al in t h e church
.  And t he Ger m ans s ent a n honor 
guar d  there .  Yes .   And they 
allowed his coffin to be 
draped in the Fr ench fla
g.  So -- and when -- when -- so they had a Mass 
inside the c hurc h and when t hey c a me out , you 
know, pe ople wer e carr ying the c o ffi n on t heir  
shoulders , a n d t he Ger ma ns ha d t he sa
lute with their 
rifles.  Ye s.  
Q:  Now, I ma y have  interrupted
 you earli er.  Whe n y
ou wer e -- whe n you le
ft Paris to go t o  
Brittany --

A:  Ye s.   
Q:  --  was  that beca use  you a
ll felt it was safer because the 
Ge r ma ns  had al ready a rrive d?   
A:  Well, it was -- was -- was al so
 because the battlefront 
was getting close to us
.  And the day tha t  
we left -- we were living
 outside Paris and it was like a devel
opment, we -- I me
an, little cottages ,  
and a garden.  It was our 
second home , actually
.  And we could hear the gu
n all night long -- guns --  
big guns.  Big guns , artil lery.  Whic h were c l os e 
t o us .  And Ger ma n plan
es flyi ng all over a nd so 
forth.  And t hen in t he morni ng wh
en we got  up, at the end of t he 
str eet s -- of the st reet there, a  
company, or  a pla t oon 
of Fre nc h infa ntry.  And t hey were c ol
onial troops.  They 
were Senegalese. 
The y were i n foxholes wit h
 -- looked like a battle was going to ta
ke place right ther e.  So we fl ed. 
We  fle d.  And our  neighbor -- ne
xt- d oor nei ghbor  -- was  fro m  that
 pla ce a nd she  sa
y, Okay, we 'll 
take  -- her  son wa s   

 

fi ghti ng -- a nd she 's sa yi ng, Okay, le t 's go to my si
ster 's in Brittany.  So 
we t ook the train.  The 
trains were still working.  You k
now, it's crazy -- stuff is absolute
ly crazy.  So the trains were  
worki ng, we  got to Pari s.  We had t o cha nge railr oad stati on -- we 
went from              
 to              . 
An d there, of course, it was confus
ion.  The y di dn't know whic h tr
ai n woul d lea ve at when, but t hey  
were trying to get the train.  
And fi nally we got the 
train which was going th
e direction that we 
wa nte d to go.  It took us l i ke -- quit e -- al most a 
da y.  The train was pa cke d but we got t here .  An d 

when we got  out of the r a
ilroa d sta tion, t he ta xis wer e
 there.  I -- li fe was nor
mal  ther e.  The taxis, 
people were in the si
dewalk cafe and - - th
e y didn't know.    
Q:  Yo u went up there, yo
u s aid, i n e ar l y J une?     

 

A:  We  le ft Paris June t he  10t h.   

Q:  Ha dn't -- hadn't the Germans al
r ea dy come  i nto Fr anc e i n M ay?   
A:  Oh, ye s.  Oh, 
yes.  Yes.    
Q:  But just not  into Pari s yet?

A:  Not -- no, no.  The y e ntere d Paris ,  I belie ve , Ju
ne the 15th.  We were -- 
actuall y, we didn't have  
to leave that area but we didn't k
now that at t he ti me, see.  Thos
e soldi ers who -- Paris was an ope n 
city.  Was declared an open city
.  So the de fense around Pari s  wa
s canceled by t he French mili tary 
people or -- I don't know, 
maybe they just fl ed, you know.  But one
 of the last major battles of Pa ris 
took pl ace maybe ten k
ilometer s fr om where we were
.  In the forest --  it 's 
a dense --  at the ti me, i t  
wa s a de nse  forest .  Pa rt of that big f orest  go
ing from __________  all t h
e  way t o  _________ and 
so fort h.  And the Fre nc h fought ver y, ver y ha
r d  in _________, which is  
25, 26 kilomet ers fro m  
Paris .  An d we  went  th er e whe n we  c a me b a c k in  
July a nd not hing had cha
nge d fr om t h e bat tle fiel d 
exce pt t hat t he dea d wer e burie d.  But it was pr
ovisional  gra v es, wit h wo
oden crosses and hel mets  
which were on the ground, 
and weapons and -- it wa
s the re mnants of a ba
ttle.  And yo
u could see 
that t he battl e was fier ce.     
Q:  Whe n you wer e  li ving that mont h up in 
Britta ny a nd the Ge r ma ns were there, di d they 
disti nguish between Je ws  and non-Je ws?   

A:  Oh, no.  No.  
The Ger mans coul dn't car e less.  At the ti
me -- they were in 
t h e Ger ma n  Ar my . 
And they -- they interf
ered very little with th
e French administ
ration.  The armi
stice had bee n  
signed.  The Vic hy gove
rnme nt was in c har ge .  The Ger ma n
s wer e contr olli ng, esse ntiall y - - 
railroa d s yst e m wa s cont rolled by t he m, ma ybe the pos
t office, in terms of s
upervision.  But they  
had a bs olute ly no i nter fe r ence wit h the Fr enc h, a bsol utel y none what soe v er.  Ac tuall y , the y we r e  

trying t o be  friendl y.  The y didn'
t  as k a nybody " Are  you Je wis h or 
not? "  No.  Absol utel y not .    
Q:  So  you decided to
 ret urn to Paris?  
A:  We ll, we  ha d t o.  We  ha d t o.  We  ha d t o.  We
 couldn't st ay there.  The -- that village wa s very, 
very -- t hat city was ver
y, very small.  We had no
 place  to sta y .  We  -- ou
r mone y wa s r unning out. 
My fat her couldn't wor k t here.  
So since we were i n the occupi ed
 zone a nywa y, we had to go back  
home .  So --  and t he Ge r ma n al so wa nted t he pe op
le wh o wer e  re fu gee s  to
 go back to where t hey

for m t o get  on the  trai n.  And t h

don't r ecall e xactl y, but  they mi ght ha
ve a box on that form
, or one wa y to ask if
 you wer e  Je wis h or  
not .  But I 'm not quit e sure.  But a nywa y, to get on
 that train, you nee ded a pass fro m t he Ge r mans.  
And we got there, we 
got into Paris.  And that's
 when t he i mpact  also -- we
 left Paris an
d a nd Pa ris a  
mont h earlie r was Pari s -- you know, the buse s, a n d 
the car s, a nd the taxi s 
and no Ger ma n.  And al l  
of a sudde n, there wer e very fe w bu
se s, no taxi s -- now ta xis were ju
st for t he Ger mans.  There wer e  
very fe w t a xis which wer e  reser ved
 simply fo r the Germans.  And 
Ger ma ns ever ywher e, in all ki nds  
of uni for ms.  All kinds .  And t hey
 had taken the               cafe and that was a --               and this and 
that, and restaurant          
   .  And t hey ha d pos t e
rs wit h pr opaganda a nd warni ngs .  I t was a  sa d 
picture.  A very sa
d picture.  And so many -- 
so many business 
were -- were s
till closed down. 
People  ha d not ret urned.  So we 
arrived there and t he Me
tro was working -- Metr
o was workin
g.  So 
we took the Metro.  Went to th
e ot her  station, took the trai n a nd 
we nt bac k home .  That wa s Jul y ,  
1940.  And l i fe  was -- li fe
 was as usual, at least 
temporarily.  Unt
il -- I'm trying to remember if it 
was September of that year that 
-- that was t he Ger man who asked 
-- the census of the Jews.  But  
the census wa s done by the 
Fr ench.  And my father ha
d to go to              
.                was the 
admini strati ve center  -- i t  wa
s the              
 of that  depart me nt  where  we we r e , whic h wa s  at t he  ti me 
called               and now 
it 's -- I don't know what.  It was change
d sinc e the n .  So he went there and 
he ha d to r e gister .  And he re gist
er ed the whole fami l y. 
 And that was t he begi nni ng of that of t hat  
spiral of discrimination and persecut
ion and so forth.  So -- so shor
tly after that, he had to fill out  
for ms about our bel ongings, our furn
i ture, our je welry, our books  of 
art, et  ceter a, et cetera.  An d 
then we c oul dn't ha ve a t elephone, we coul dn't ha ve
 a radi o se t.  And so t h at wa s in 1940.  And the n  
he had re stri ctions a bout  what he could do, in t e r m
s  of work.  He c oul dn't do thi s, he  coul dn't do 
that.  But  he  wa s sti ll worki ng.  He  coul dn't c are
 less .  And I  wa s goi ng t o
 sc hool, my sis t er wa s  
goi ng t o sc hool .  And for  ordi nar y 
life -- life was absolu
te ly nor mal for us.  We ha d -- we had ver y 
-- exc ept for  those re stric tions .  And we couldn't  t ravel t oo far .   But -- but  ot
her  tha n t h at, we could 
go to t he movies , we coul d go t o 
-- our food -- you know, 
the c oupons for food we
re the  sa me as the

general population.  We  had absol ut ely no discr i mi
nati on at t hat ti me, e i t her from t he  Ger ma ns or  
the Fre nc h.  Absol utel y none .  None
.  Then in 1942, that's
 whe n t hings start ed t o cha nge  dra sticall y.  
Q:  All  of thi s ti me  bet we en fall of 1940 
and '42, your  
life  was relatively normal?  
A:  Ab sol ute ly.   
Q:  I n Pari s?   

A:  Outside of Paris.  Th e 
             .  
Q:  Okay.  You --  okay, I 'm sorr
y, because I didn't under - - I  don't  
thi nk you tol d me that you had 
gone t o       
       .  
A:  Oh, that wa s at the be ginning 
of the war, in 1939.  We were af
r aid of Par i s being bombarded, so  
-- and t he  Fr enc h governme nt aske
d people  who had fa mil y i n t h
e provinces or a sec ondary home  
outside of Paris to leave -- mo st of
 the big cities.  They 
asked most of the big 
cities, but essentially  
Paris .  They did the sa me in England, by the wa y,
 at the be gi nni ng of the  war.  And t hey se nt the  
children all over the place 
a nd some  of t he m we re se nt t o Engl
and also -- to t he Uni ted Stat es -- 
Englis h c hil dren -- and Ca nada.  
So  -- so we  had that second hom
e , a nd we move d there .  We  
moved there.  At fi
rst my father was still keep
ing his business in 
Paris.  And the 
business was not  
good anymore.  So  -- and he was 
known locally, so he fo
und a -- he found enou
gh t o do locall y.  
Q:  Did you have to id
ent i fy yoursel ve s as  J e
ws?  Did you have to w
ear a star?  Did you --  
A:  No.  Not fr om 1940, until 1942.    

Q:  And you still had good rela
tions with your neighbors or 
Christian friends at school?  
A:  Oh, ye s.  Oh, yes .  Oh, ye s.  Abs o lutely.  Ab
solutely.  Absolutely.  It
 was -- life was -- was very 
nor mal .  Ver y nor mal .  Yes.    

Q:  Okay.  So you were 
saying that this went on
 until sometime
 in 1942?  
A:  I'm tryi ng to reme mber i f -- I be
li eve i n 1941 t hey arrest ed -- they 
start e d to arr est Jews i n Paris. 
I beli eve t hat  was  whe n t h ey put  the m 
i n t he               t her
e.  I bel ieve that
 wa s July, '41.  
Q:  I think it was '42.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349

A.   '42?   Okay.  Oka y. 
 So that was the turning point.  When
 -- when -- July, '42, 
when -- ye s, yes ,  
that 's July, '4 2.  Beca us e my sist
e r  wa s spe ndi ng t he ni ght i n Paris 
with some friend
s of ours during 
that night when they came 
to arrest people.  And they
 --  the friends wer e l iving al most  at t he t op o f  
the bui ldi ng and they could hear the police in the 
mi ddle of the night , cli m bing the stai rs, knoc king 
on t he door s, a nd so fort
h.  So t hei r ne xt-door  ne
ighbor, who wa s Chri stia
n, got them
 in their 
apartment.  And that 's why --  that's how my sister
 was able t o escape that 
night.  So -- so shortl y 
aft er t hat  -- no, befo
re that -- shortly be
fore that --   
Q:  Let  me i nterr upt you.
  Because I t hink for the 
r ecor d, whe n you sa y t he Vel odr ome , I don't  thi nk  
that s o me body wat c hi ng this t a pe
 might know what you're talkin
g a bout.  I me an, I  know what  
you're talking about --  
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  --  but some body
 else may not.  
A:  Okay.            
    was a indoor stadium in Paris, built ar
ound the turn of the 
century, essentially for 
bicycle r aces.  That 's  where 
they have the six days of
 Paris.  Li ke the si x da
ys of -- I don't  remember  
where, but it  was very popular  at 
the turn of the century.  And it we
nt on for  ma ybe 50 or 60 yea r s. 

And people would go t he r e for si x 
da ys.  The y would bring food an
d so fort h and the y woul d watch 
thos e -- thos e people would ra ce ar ound l i ke squirre
ls for six days.  And so
 that sta di u m was bi g 
enough to accommodat e -- not accommodat e -- not 
accommodat e -- but to sit ma ybe two, three 
thousa nd pe ople .  And when t he Fre n
ch police arr ested t he Jews i n Pa
ris for the first ti me on a large 
scale after the agreements between the French 
gover n me nt  and t he  Vi chy governme nt and t h e 
Ger ma ns , they ha d not ma de pr ovisi ons t o hous e  su
ch a l arge  populati on.  So they dec i ded t o par k  
them in that stadium, which was called             .   And -- because it was the winter one -- it was 
covered.  So the conditions ther
e were absolutely appalling.  
And t he Frenc h peopl e who wer e  
allowed to -- the French 
Re d Cross , a nd so fort h - -  were all o we
d t o go t her e and tr y to give  some  
mil k for young c hildr en or  medi cati on for  el derl y pe
ople were so appalled 
by what  they sa w, I

believe it helped later on, to a certa
i n extent, t o open the eyes of 
Fr enc h pe ople a nd tr y to hel p the  
Je ws    
in the fut ure .  Or at lea s t to avoi d being i nvolve d.  And t he y really s a w that, a nd the Cat holi c  

chariti es al so were i nvol ved.  
And s o  it bec a me a  big c ontrove rsy 
among t he French peopl e.  They 
didn't real ize  that discri mination coul d be that ba d.  And s o me wer e ple ased, of course.  Sa ying 

" Well, t he J ews des erve d that ."  But  I don't beli e v
e they were a majority.  
I don't beli e ve that .  So 
that 's t he           
    .  Whic h mea ns t he  winter -- how do 
you sa y --  vel odr ome  - -  bic ycl e tra c k.  
Q:  Ye s.   

A:  As  opposed to summe r.  

Q:  And onc e pe ople wer e take n 
t here -- once the Jews 
were  r ounde d -- of Pari s were r ounde d up 

and taken there --   

A:  So -- so t hen the 
Fre n ch gover n me nt deci ded that
 they woul d use  a plac e  calle d 
             .   
And               was a huge publi c housing 
pr oje c t  whi c h wa s not c o mpl e te
 in 1941 or '42.  So the y  
transferred the Jewish population from               to       
       .  And               became, really, the first -- 
the first stop to Auschwitz
 in the history of the pe
r secuti on of t he Jews i n 
occupied Fran
ce.  And we  
kne w pe opl e  who were  t here .  Some  -- s o me  pe ople  were  
released from       
       .  But the 
agreement s bet ween -- from what I underst and -- th
e agree ments between th
e Ger man and French 
was that the French 
ha d t o arre st s o many pe opl e, l i ke a quot
a  of Je ws .  And the y would be arr este d  
until they had enough cars 
and railroad cars and so fo
rth to take them wherev
er they had to go in 
Ger ma n y or Pol and.  But  afte r that t h ey opened other ca mps i n occ upi
ed France.               near 
wa s one .  And -- I 'm tryi ng to re me mber the ot her  one -- but t hos e wer e 
the two places,           
   --               
I don't believe was only 
for Jews.        
        wa s e ss e
ntially for Jews.    
Q:  We re t he  Je ws  wh o were s e nt
 there initially 
Fr ench Jews?  
A:  No .  No.   No .  No.  The y we
re essentially Jews wi
t h -- the first one were
 Ger ma n Je ws -- well ,  
essentially, Polish Jews or 
Jews who had no nationality. 
              
 or whatever.  Yes.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349

Q:  You s a i d that t his wa s a rea l  t urni ng poi nt  
in pe opl e 's perce pti on - -  in non- Je wis h people 's 
perce pti on.  Up until  t hen, wer e
 they fairly respectful  of 
the occupation and of the Vich y 
governme nt?   

A:  No.  No.  Not -- not i n the occ upi ed zone.  In
 the occ upi ed zone , the fe
elings were either, well, 
we are de fea t ed, we ha ve  to survi ve, we have to 
- -  we ha ve to just, you know, go wit h the crowd.  
Or the r e wer e other s who were sa ying, well , we ar
e going to build a new Eu
rope , a ne w world.  And 
we have t o -- we ha ve to get rid of the Jews
 and the Fre e Mas on and 
Communis m -- Communism,  
that was the Bolsheviks.  And th
en there were t he people who 
wer e eit her ope nly agai nst t he  
Ger mans and Vi chy or secretl y ag
ai nst the Ge r ma ns a nd Vichy.  And t he Fr enc h --  the Fre nc h, 
basically, are -- they 
hate the Germans   
just as much as the Ger m ans hate 
the French.  It 's a tragedy of hist
ory tha t  two nations whi ch are s o 
di fferent have a -- are neighbors.  And even to 
t h is day, France and Ger many, yes, t hey ar e bi g 
fri ends, but , no.  No.  They are very
, very di ffer ent.  And t he feelin
gs -- the fe elings of  the Fr enc h 
are still anti-German.  

Q:  So you bega n t o s ay i n '42 w
ith this massive r
ound- up in Paris, thi ngs s t
arted changi ng for  you .  
You were living in    
           .  
A:  Ye s.  Ye s.  So -- so we kne
w t ha t  -- and pe ople were t ell ing 
my fat he r  also, you know, you're  
crazy t o stay -- to stay --  to stay here.  You have
 to leave.  You're going t o be arr este d .They -- s o 
what the y were doi ng, they were -- 
they started with Pari
s, and they were -- th
ey were us ing -- it wa s 
like -- like --  you know, l i ke whe n you drop a stone in water , you have those wa ves .  And -- and so 

they were arresting very syste matic
ally by zone, so such da te wa s th
e arr e st in that  area.  And that  
wa s all planned with the French po
lice, the number of room available 
t her e and t here, and so fort h,  
and the over -ti me for the poli ce.  It  
was -- was -- j ust -- I found out af
ter it  was very -- 
it was --  life  
wa s nor ma l for those c o ps.  Yes .  Okay, so what  
are we doing today?   Oh, arre st those pe ople --  
that 's -- so we knew that i t  was co
mi ng in our area .  Our neighbor t o
ld my father they arrested Je ws 
in              .    
           was about six mi
l es fr om us.  And so -- but we --
 we --  we  di dn't know e xactl y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349  
14 
 
 
 
 
what was going on.  
I -- I -- I had t he feeling -- and I knew 
--  I didn't know e xactl y, but the Royal  
Air Force would drop
 leaflets over France, which 
was called the          
    .  And 
it was like a little 
newsletter, printed on very, very 
thin paper, but strong paper. 
 And t he y would dr op that by t he  
thousa nds .  And the y ha d that warni ng for t he Je ws , talki
ng a bout the          
      group, and the Je ws  
who were ga ssed i n trucks.  And t hat wa s, I believe th
at was in early April of th
at year t hat I got that  
-- one ni ght we hear d the  planes 
a bove our hea d, and t he next  morni ng we  had t hose fl yers i n our  
garden.  And we were not
 suppose d to pi ck the m
 up.  We  were supposed to call t he Ger man 
i mmediat ely.  But - - so we read 
t hat, a nd I  be ca me  very, ver y, very
 tense.  But th
e propaganda from 
Je wish pe opl e was t hat , don't list en.
  That 's not tr ue .  How ca n t he 
Ger ma ns ,  suc h a  ci vili zed nati on, 
do t hi ngs  like that?   No.  
They just want t o send t he Je ws in
 c a mps  to wor k.  Why elderly pe opl e  
and c hil dren wor k in c a mp, though.  So -- s o -- s o 
-- my -- my parents were tr
ying to -- to believe  
that, see , be caus e, it wa s -- where c oul d we go?  
 We had no plac e -- we
 didn't know.  So the 
pressure on my fat her wa
s such -- and on fri ends also was suc h 
-- that he got in touch with people 
who were worki ng in t he  dia mond busines s.  And 
the dia mond busine ss , they wer e ve ry chummy 
wit h the Ger mans.  The Ger mans 
we re deal ing in dia monds, a nd gol
d, a nd so forth.  And t he only 
people the y coul d deal  wit h were  the Je wi sh pe opl
e wh o were in that busine
ss .  And s o --  I don't  
know all  the  det ails  be ca use  I wa s not c urious  at  th
e time  -- but  my father got in touch with an 

orga niza tion through t ha t -- one 
of t he diamond dealer  -- where 
we woul d cr oss from occ upi ed 
Fra nce into non-oc cupie d Fra nce on 
a regul ar trai n.  And one pers on, I bel i eve he was Ger ma n , ha d 
thos e pas s, t hos e --  those         
        made in our name.  An
d s o t he  da y that  
we left, which was 
Nove mber  the 7t h, 
on a Friday --   
Q:  1942?  

A:  1942.  That sa me  da y -- we 
were not sleeping in our home for 
a fe w da ys, we were sleepi ng at  
neighbors  -- and -- what 's  that?   

Q:  Do  you hear th
e noise outside?  
A:  Ye s.  Ok ay.    

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349  
15 
 
 
 
 
Q:  You sai d  you were  st ayin
g at a neighbor's  house.  
A:  Yes , we  were  sta yin g at  n e
ighbor house .  The  s a me neighbor
 who took us  to her siste r i n 
Brittany.  And -- and I was goi
ng to school in Paris at
 the time.  I d
ecided that Paris 
was the safe st. 
Bec ause nobody kne w me in Pa ris. 
 I would t ake t he trai n earl y in 
the mor ning, it was 
dark, and tha t  
wa s like a --  not e xactl y boar ding 
sc hool , but I took one me al  there 
a nd I would come  at night and 
when I was i n that sc hool  I wa s sa fe.  
It was called              .  It was a very old college which Loyola 
attended in the 1500's.  It wa s a 
pri vat e sc hool, t he y di dn't c are, th
e y di dn't ask an
y ques tions  and I  
wa s not we a r ing my -- t h e star.  An
d I neve r wa nt ed to wear t he star , I took a cha nce , but I ne ver - - 
didn't  wear  i t .  So I  was  goi ng to th
at  sc hool a nd wa s tr ying t o bl en
d wit h  the  rest  of t he people . 
And no que s tion as ked, a bsol utel y not hing.  It was 
-- the other peopl e and, you know.  And so -- but  
when I  was goi ng bac k home , t he pr e
ssu re was there.  So anyway, my
 fa ther got t hat
 -- into that 
orga niza tion and t he day t hat we were leavi ng, that 's
 the day t hey came t o ar
rest us .  But they didn't  
have e nough pe ople  to ar rest us, so what t hey wer e 
doing, t he y  sent  a cop a nd 
aski ng us  to go t o t he 
preci nct with all our pa pe rs and s o fort h for busi
ness -- for personal busi
n e ss -- and we k n e w wh at it 
wa s.  And s o  -- and so t he  railroa
d station was about a mile fr om 
our place and we 
were -- we knew 
the tr ain was  taki ng us t o Toulouse .  
Our neighbor  next  door  ha d a  ni ece    
who was living very close 
to the Spanish border in that sm
all village and that was a villag
e called               
.  Okay.   

Q:  Well , I wa s asking you, be for e you fl

 TAPE NUMBER 2 
 
A:  Oh, oka y.  So the  fi rst --  the  
first year of t he Occupati on, at fi
r st,  we wer e --  we did n 't  k no w  
what was going on. 
 So we didn't wa nt to ma ke a ny move s, we
 just didn't know.  So I -- I attended a  
local  sc hool in       
        t h ere.   
And the s ec ond year -- t hat was 1941, '42 -- sinc e 
life was --  was mor e  nor mal, I we nt bac k to a 
school -- not in Paris, but in              , 
whic h is  a bout 32, 35 kilome ters
 outside of Paris, where I 
we nt duri ng the fir st ye ar of the wa r -- from 1939. 
 1939-1940.  And i n that sc hool, things wer e 
absolutely normal. 
 I would leave in the morning,
 take the train to -- or if
 the weat her  was nice, ri de  
my bi ke -- was no more t han -- I 
don't  know -- ma ybe 12 miles  or le ss 
than that.  And 
go to school . 
At lunch ti me , we coul dn't eat in
 s chool be cause of the s h ortage
 of food, s o the s chool ha d a n  
agreement with a rest aur a nt
 in town where t he Ger mans al so had 
an a gree m ent.  So we would go t o  
that r esta ura nt a nd eat li ke re gul ar c ustome r s t he r
e.  And we had a s peci a l disc ount be caus e it wa s  
the school, and the fo
od was good.  Because
 we were in a rur al  area, so 
we had plent y of food.  And  
the Ger ma ns  wer e  ne xt t o us an
d the y would gre et us .  And I  re
me mb er one of them one day wa s 
like, crying, and we didn't know
 what  ha ppe ne d, a nd t he waitr ess 
say " Oh, poor guy.  He got hi s 
order s to go on the Rus sian Front.
"  An d saying "Good."  So -- so 
li fe - -  and we ha d sports i n  
school , and we woul d tr avel 
t o pla y wit h di ffe r ent schools , s o we
 woul d tr avel i n a radius of 60, 65 
mile s of Pari s.  And most  of the 
time  we had one of ou
r teachers, but I rememb
er one --  one  da y we  
didn't ha ve our t eac her, so we r eall y  -- reall y 
had -- you know, like teen-a
ge boys who are le ft on 
their own and -- and we ha
d a l ot of fun.  And --  
Q:        
         
A:  Ye s.   Ye s.  Yes .  Yes .   Ye s.    
Q:  Wa s there any sense of wh
at else  wa s goi ng on?   Of 
dete nt ion?   Of round- up?   
A:  Well , we  -- we -- we wer e livi
ng with that constant threat of th
e r ound-up.  The consta nt thre at 
of what is going to be t he ne xt ste p, what a r
e they going to do to us?   And -- and -- and nobod y 
wanted, r eall y, t o face 
that.  There were very 
few people who wanted t o 
face t hat .  We were livi n g

just t he day t o da y, and okay, tomo
rrow -- and tomorro
w -- we'll see t o morrow. 
 But then  when --  
when the  r o und-up st art ed r eally to
 affect  us , when frie nds or me
mb er s o f fa mi lies  wer e  arr e ste d,  
wh en the  res t rictio ns on  wh at we  c
ould do started really to
 show that it's 
not that benign
.  Things are 
goi ng to be very drasti c.  That 's whe n -- that 's 
when we -- we deci ded to take acti on.  So some  
people we nt  into t he Re sista nce , some pe ople t r ie
d to go i n to hi ding, s o me
 pe ople we nt to t hei r  
nation of ori gin, tryi ng t o like -- li ke  some of 
the Roma nian we nt to th
e Roma ni an e mbassy and  
were trying to go back to Romania because -- we 
- -  we were  re ceivi ng letter s
 from Romania.  They 
were censored, but still they were 
-- they were normal letters.  An
d they were -- we could guess  
fr om what t hey were t el ling us that life was 
ver y nor ma l, a nd the y wer e sayi ng " Why don't you 
come here?   Why do you st
a y there, you know, fa
r away from us?"  So 
-- but t he Romani an a nd  
other nation didn't want the Je ws ther e, see .  So y
ou could fe el  that the trap
 was -- was really -- was 
really cl osi n g down on you a nd t he  ga me was t o 
fi nd a hol e in that tra p.  And e ve r ybody ha d a  
di ffere nt st or y or a di ffer ent pe opl e tr ying to hel p.  And s o the  goal was t o go int o Vichy Fra nce --  
unocc upie d Fra nce .  But at 
least we are not wit h t he Ger mans.  
So -- so there were all kind of ways 
to get there -- illegally, I mean.  A
nd -- but they were dangerous.  A
ll of them were 
dangerous.  And 
-- and some unscrupul
ous people were ma king good mo ney by
 -- by telling peopl
e "I will take you 
over the border," and robbing them 
or selling them to the Germans an
d so forth.  So
 -- or killing 
them.  

Q:  You kne w t his  at  the ti me?   

A:  Yes.  Oh, ye s.  Oh, yes . 
 Yes.  We knew that
 because we hear d of 
fami lies who were -- who 
tried to ge t over and we never he ard of the m a gai
n or -- or -- we kne w the y had been arr ested.  And 
so -- s o you wer e suppos ed to go 
t o t hat far m, and at the end of 
the field i t  was Vichy France and  
they had a                waiting for you with a bi
cycle or stuff li ke t hat.  So
me --  so me were l e giti mat e ,  
I know people who cr oss ed li ke t hat .  But --  and 
i t  was a bi g - -  a l ong bor der bet wee n -- bet w ee n  

Occupied and not -Occupied France. 
 But my fat h er found t ha t  wa y 
where it was really -- at least 
from the -- from what we were tol d 
- -  was strictl y  sa fe.  We t o ok the 
train.  We -- before we got t o

that checkpoint, wh
oe ver  was t he gui de woul d gi ve us our 
pa ss, the Ger m an woul d come , and the y  
were legitimate pass in our name , and they coul dn't see that t hey 
were -- they were forged.  And 
they woul d sta mp t he m and t he n t w o hours  late r 
we woul d be out of Occu
pied Fr ance.  It was 
costly.    
Q:  Did -- were ther
e other people who were
 travelling with you?  
A:  It wa s a  large  gr oup.  And I 
was  never c urious about  that, but my
 Mother told me that after the 
war , s he hea r d on t he ra dio a --  Fr enc h ra dio --  
a progra m about that group.
  And esse nti ally, why i t  
wa s so costl y, it 's beca
use what t hey wer e doing, they were
 a Je wish or ga nizati on who wa s taking 
the c hildr en of pe opl e who had be en rounde d up a
nd t heir  childr en ha d bee n -- not arre sted - -  
hidden.  And the y we re taking the m to far ms a n
d so forth i n unocc upie d Fra nce .  And the y we r e  
always  with adult s a nd th
ey -- the adults were lik
e  their  pa rent s, a nd s o fo
r t h.  And t he y would do 
that, I belie ve, once a we ek, or on
ce ever y two weeks, I don't  reme
mb er e xactl y.  B ut my mo th er  
told me -- but I never had the curiosity to go to the              and find out.  No.  After -- after that -- 
aft er t he war, I just -- I j ust sayi
ng well, we esc a ped, a nd t he  past is
 t he past .  It 's only now that  
sayi ng well , I don't ha ve that many more yea r s,
 a n d ma ybe some body s hould know what ha ppe ne d. 
But at the ti me , everybody had the sa me s t or y.  Ev
erybody who sur vived the 
war , Je ws or non-J e ws ,  
survived the war.  And we all 
ha d t his  stor y.  Al l of us .  
Q:  So  you were on 
a tr a i n goi ng sout h?   
A:  Ye s.  The regul ar trai n to from Pa ris to Toul ou
se.  And when -- we le ft wit h another  fa mil y who  
wer e cl ose  fr iends of the fa mi l y fo
r -- forever.  And we
 had for g ed papers .  
And e ver ybody knew us 
in that -- in that community.  So -- so we went 
to the railroad station, take
 the train a nd we ha d -- 
like we go on a vacati on.  You know, we had suit case
s, bicycl es.  And we put that on the train t o  
Toulouse .  And -- and t he man at the railroa d st a
tion, he ha d bee n there  for ye ars a nd ye ars and 
years , a nd he kne w us , e speci ally t he  other  co
upl e -- everybody kne w t he y 
were J e wi sh.  And he  
looked at us  and he  sa y "Toulous
e?   You have a ticket for Toulouse
?"  Yes.  Okay.  So we went,  
you know, a nd we  ha d j u st s mall  sui t c ases t hat we 
kept  with us , incl udi ng one 
with the food that my

mother save d.  And so we had -- s h
e had s ugar, a nd s he ha d oil, an
d she had coffee , and she had all  
kind of stuff like t hat.  And we ca
rried that on the train.  And we 
spent -- we went t o dinner -- t o  
friends of ours.  The wi fe  of a 
frie nd of our s who wa s a pri soner 
of war , so she -- she was sa fe  
because of that.  And then we went to           
    a n d took the  tr ain for To
ul ous e.  And we were --  we 
-- we -- t he compart ments were book
ed i n a dva nce , not by us, but by
 that or gani zati on, so we --  
when we got there we got our seat
 assignment in the train.  And 
-- no, we got i n t h e stati on --  
railroa d stati on -- there ar e Ger ma n s a t  patrol , they 
had Fre nch polic e patr ol lin
g.  But they were not  
chec king a n ybody.  Abs olutel y not.  Dur i ng -- a t
 least that time.  Mayb
e some other ti me t hey 
would round up pe ople  or what but 
nobody as ke d us a nyt hi ng.  We 
we nt on the  trai n, nobody sai d 
"Do you have a pas s? " or  what.  
Absolutely not .  The trai n -- okay. 
 What they wanted is "Did you 
pay your  far e to go t o Toulouse? "
  That 's  what  t he y wa nte d t o 
know.  So  we went there.    
Q:  Did your card identify
 you a s bei ng Je wis h?   
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  Forged card?  

A:  Yes .  Ye s.  No , n ot th e forg
ed one .  My pare nt s ha d the for ged
 one .  I had my r egula r one .  And 
a ye ar e arlier  it was  sta m ped "Je w"  with a bi g re d sta mp.   
             .  A
nd a  fr iend of mi ne t old me  
that i f you dip a woode n  matc h w
ith a cotton tip -- like a Q-tip -- if
 you dip that in bleac h and yo u 
go ver y car e f ully over t h e red, it disa ppe ar.  So I t
ook a c ha nce  and I we nt very care full y over --  di d 
that -- took one of those long, wo
oden matches that we still had in
 France at the time, with the 
cotton, bl eac h, and it  dis appeare d. 
 So the onl y --  the  on
ly wa y they could ha ve found that  I wa s  
Je wish was i f I woul d be  arreste d in circumstan
ces where they would check on my identify .  But 
mine was a legitimate on
e.  You could see t hat 
it was not forged.  And 
I was taking a chance 
beca use ha d they c hec ke d on me , a sked tha t  pre ci nct there 
in              "What about him?" and they 
would have looked in their               and said "Oh,
               .  But I took a chance.  I wanted to 
survive at the time .  And so --  so
 we -- we  cr os sed that  
-- that line of demar
cation.  It was very 
i mpressive.  Ver y, very i mpressi
ve.  It was -- was very scary, because the train woul d stop in the

mi ddle of the night and you had t o 
have the curt ains down a nd sit in
 your seat and you were not  
allowe d to look outs i de .  And we
 c o uld he ar, you know, the Ge
r ma ns wa lking up a nd down like a  
wooden               with their heavy boots in the mi
ddle of the night there.               .  And from both 
ends of the train they had Ge
r ma n  soldier s wi th -- officer  and so for t h -- chec ki ng those  
there.  And they were talking lo
udl y a mong t he m selve s.  And wa s ve
ry organize d.  And the Ger man 
Army is very militaristic
 and traditional.  And I 
found out that in their 
rules and regu
lation when 
you ha ve a chec k-point, you have 
to ask, I belie ve, a ma jor and a
not her officer a nd a n NCO a nd 
then you ha ve t o have  a  private 
hol ding a -- one of thos e la mps --  oi
l lamp.  So they were -- I can 
see -- sti ll see that t all Ger man 
offi cer who was, I beli eve, a ma
j or or somet hing, who must ha ve  
been a he ro of Wo rld War 
I.  He mu st have been in his 50's 
and tal king t o t he other one , a nd the  
NCO and they were looking at the             
  and they were looking at
 the identity card, and they  
wa nte d to find out what was in my
 mot her 's sui t case.  So she opene
d t hat a nd the oil wa s a ll over t he  
sugar and everything, so th
ey laughed and they said "Well."  And 
then they have th
at little guy wit h  
the la nter n followi ng and he  was jus t  
as fri ght ened a s we we re.  And 
so j ust be fore t h e train le ft , I  
wa s too c uri ous .  I ha d t o pe ep out
.  And I sa w t hat a nd it  was real
ly frightening.  We were -- we 
wer e on a -- like a -- a pl atfor m 
wit h barbed wire , big fl oodlight
s and those Ge rmans going up and 
down wit h t heir ri fl e on their shou
lde r .  Oh, it was  -- so t h
e trai n left, and by th
e n we -- we wer e  o n  
the other si de, a nd the man who was wit h 
us c a m e ba ck to col l ect t hos e --  our  
            .  And he told 
my --  he  told us  Oka y, be  ver y 
care f ul  whe n you get int o Toul ouse
 because there are ver y i mport ant 
eve nts whic h are  ta king plac e i n the worl d.  And 
the sa me  night that we  
got there, Eisenhower 
landed i n - -  i n Cas abla nc a.  Was  duri ng t he ni ght
 Sat urda y t o Sunda y.  
And the Ger ma ns occ upi ed 
France the 11th of Novemb
er, a nd they were pla nni ng to do that
,  from what I un
der stand, a long  
time  before they did, but three da
ys  la ter the Ger m ans were bac k.  
We  sa w  t he Ger man
 back.  So --  
but at least this time, 
nobody knew where we were
, nobody kne w who we were
.  So we go
t to that 
niece  of our  neighbor who 
didn't know wh
o we  were.  
Q:  Thi s is  i n  Toul ouse?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349  
21 
 
 
 
 
A:  No, no.  Thi s is  --  thi s is
 -- no.  So we 
l e ft Toul ous e.  
Q:  Ho w long were 
you i n Toulouse?   
A:  The time to change trains, to get to         
     .  And we - -  we -- we had abs ol utel y no idea of 
where it was.  So we had to colle
ct our luggage a n d ever ythi ng ca me
 t hrough, inc l uding my bic ycle .  
And e verything, you know, was there .  
So -- so we ask "How do we go to              ," and the guy 
said " Okay, you have to take that trai n and c hange train at that" -- we ha d to take t w o trains , so  
oka y.  So we we nt to buy the tic ke
t s , get all our luggage aga i n to go
 to t h at plac e.  And we had 
ma ybe -- and our frie nds  left .  
Left, and they were very scared.  They had one              in Toulouse, 
so we di dn't  see them 'ti l  aft e
r the war.  And so we t ook that
 train.  And the train was working 
maybe t wice a week. 
 And that was a Sat urda y.  And t he tr
ai n wa s wor king on the Satur day, s o by 
the time -- and it was ve
ry early in t he morni ng.  We got  th
er e like 5: 30, 6 in 
Toulouse.  And my  
mother was very pleased 
because she saw a French sol dier on 
the pl at for m there in Toul ouse.  A  
French soldier of the Vichy Frenc
h.  But still, it was -- yo
u know, French flag and -- it was French. 
Not  Ger ma n .  So  -- s o we get  
-- we get in               by ab
out 1 p.m.   And by th
en my parent s were 
abs olute ly e xha uste d.  They were --  coul dn't ta ke  
it anymore.  So  they say "O
kay.  You have a bi ke. 
We don't know where that village is
.  We don't know anythi
ng.   You go and you 
find out."  So I got 
on my bike and I asked my direct
ion and I got into that
 village.  And I aske
d about that lady an d 
they told me where it wa
s.  And I knocked on the ir door a nd I  
say " Well , we are 
the neighbors of 
your a unt ."  And " A h.  Ok
ay."  And t hey sa y " We ll, we ha ve 
a  proble m."  She  was  livi ng i n a  bi g 
home with a  young son a nd 
she wa s -- she ha d be en wi dowe d ma yb
e less t han a month before that. 
Her husba nd wa s muc h older t han she  wa s, a nd he
 wa s a di sa bl ed vetera n of Worl d War  I who ha d  
bee n gass ed and he  di ed.  He was  
fairly young when he 
di ed, he  was --  he  wa
s not 60.  But s he wa s  
-- she was -- at the ti me she was like 31, 32.  Sh
e was a young widow, a ve
ry young widow.  And s o  
-- so I told her, you know, we are Je wis h pe ople a
nd s he -- she didn't know what Je wi sh meant.  It  
was a s mall village.  She came fr
om Brittany.  She just didn't know
 anything.  She say "Oh, you ca n 
stay here .  Sure, I have r oom."  But I have my 
fat her, my mot her and my
 sister .  "Oh, where are

they? "  I say, you know, t he railr oad s t ation.  She s a
y " Oka y, I 'l l  go with you."
  And she told her son 
"Okay, fi nis h your l unc h" -- it  was  lunchti me  --  " and
 go bac k to s chool ."  
An d so  we we nt t o pic k  
up my pare nts a nd we t o ok t he  lugga
ge and she said " Let  me prepar
e lunch fo r you." 
 An d t he n s h e 
say " Wel l, we have t o have a scena r io bec aus e th
ere is a lot of fa mily, so you are goi ng to be the  
cousin fr om Brittany."  So we 
became the cousin fr om Brittany.  
And we knew the fa
mily so well 
and -- but they sa y -- "But how c o
me we didn't see you at t he wedd
ing? " and t his a nd that or --  
" Well,  we wer e  not  th ere."   Or
, you know, things  duri ng the fa m
ily.  So -- so then when the 
Germans came , a fe w days later, 
my parents had to be i n hi di
ng because she 
felt that it wa s 
sus pici ous t o ha ve the whole fa mil y.  So we st aye d
 -- my sister and I were 
suppose d to sta y wit h  
her.  And my sister wa s still an 
a ge t o go to school.  But nobody 
wa s sa yi ng anyt hing about she has 
to go to school.  So we -- we we
r e ther e and my par ents wer e hi di
ng and wh en people were comi ng 
in the house, they were movi
ng the house and you co
uld hear that.  And 
fi nally, little by little , 
people started to find out, beca
us e we  told the m a nd my pare nts 
were telling them.  So we told a 
close frie nd of hers -- he r husband was the guid
e who took us  over the mo
untai n and wa s also th e  
gui de for Ar nol d, I found out .  And th
en a not her  fr iend of he r wa s th
e mayor of a small  city and he 
was getting memos from the police a
bout the different operat
ion.  And he would 
tell us "Oh, the y  
are pr eparing an operati on agai nst 
the Jews in Toulouse," and this 
and tha t .  And -- 
and finally she  
we nt to Pa ri s, a nd she ha d a si st
er whose hus ba nd wa s a prisoner of wa
r .  Her siste r was absolut ely 
beautiful.  She wa s one of the 
mo st beautiful wo me n that you ca
n see.  An d she had a young boy. 
And she was the mi stress of a Ge
r m an officer who was in Paris th
ere.  And so 
the l a dy who wa s  
taking care of us -- they went there t o see her an
d we as ke d her to see s o me people t hat we kne w 
also               so she we
nt there.  She stay abou
t a week.  And when she ca
me bac k, s he s ay - -  tha t  
wa s Apr il, '4 3 -- sh e 
t old us  " Well , I  cannot ke ep you a nymor
e."  An d she say "No.
  I talk to my  
sister and I t alk to Will y (ph.)" -- Wi l l y was th
e Ger man officer and frie
nd -- "and Will y say 'You  
are crazy.  You ar e hi ding Jews i n
 your home.  And you ha ve  -- just 
a cros s the st reet you have t he

thos e pe ople  are going t o be se nt to the ca mps ,  
and you going to be shot.'  So she ca me ba ck 
abs olute ly fr ighte ne d.  She say " Y ou cannot st a y
 anymore."  So my moth
er was absol utel y --  
absolutely -- totally -- 
tot ally depre sse d.  And so we had li ke 
a big fa mi ly re uni on. 
 And we wer e  s o  
close  to Spa i n t hat we s ay 
" Well , l et 's go to Spai n."   
Q:  Be fore  you made t his  de ci
sion, you were in th
is town four or fi
ve  mont hs, right?   
A:  From Novemb er the 7 or 
8t h.  And that  was  April -- t h
e first week of Ap ril.    
Q:  So  what wa s the daily life lik
e?   How threate ne d wer e you?   
Were  you just li ving nor mall y?   
A:  Wel l -- okay -- so t he German
s came and they were not in the 
area.  But  then 
around January or 
Februar y -- I  don't re me mber e xactl y  -- they had 
l i ke a re d zone goi ng all al ong t he Fre n ch- Spa nis h 
bor der - -  all  along.  And 
that wa s extremely, extrem
el y r einfor ced i n t er ms  of patr ol, a nd so fort h.  
And that -- that small pl
ace where we were was a 
village with maybe two or
 three hundred people, 
that 's all , see.  So -- so
 it had t wo or t hree street s a t  the most .  
So one st reet  was t h
e mai n road, so t o  
speak.  No.  It 's  a narr
ow roa d goi ng fr om one s m all vi llage t o
 the  ot her .  I t  was  the  wa y t o Spain 
anywa y.  And the other one was li ke
 a very narrow street -- I don't 
e ve n know i f it wa s pave d or not  
-- leadi ng to -- not eve n - -  the y di dn't eve n ha ve an
y shops ther e.  Just far m
s and s o fort h.  And t he y  
had li ke a general stor e whi ch wa s j ust acr os s the 
ho use wh e r e we we re i n 
hidi ng.  And the hous e 
wa s clos e by the road.  I should ha ve t ake n a pictur
e of that with me , but it 
doesn't matter.  So -- and 
right a cross the str eet, t h ey had t hat general st or
e .  And t he y wer e selli ng, you know, t he tobac co, 

and it was li ke a -- the baker would c o me and lea ve 
bre ad the r e and s o for t h.  And t he y woul d sell  
liquor, a nd wine, a nd it wa s like a bi g plac e, s o - -
 when t he Ger mans draw 
that line and they had  
patrol post e very mil e or  so, t hat
 was the headquarter th
er e.  Right across t he 
street from us.  And 
the pe opl e who were the owner of t hat -- of that  
gener a l stor e, their s on wa s in the Wa ffen SS - -  
French.  And they were suspicio
us that s o met hi ng was not right
 with us.  But they kne w the 
hus ba nd of t hat la dy extr e mely wel l .  He wa s a r e sp
ect ed Wor l d War I vet eran, he was  the c hie f of 
the vet eran organi zati on, and s o fort h.  And -- so - -  
so they didn't want to -- 
to really -- at the time, 
annoy t hat l ady, but I 'm 
sure with ti me t hey would have -- ha
d we st ayed ther e,
 s o met hing would

t oo da ngerous.  So one of -- one of her fri end's  
hus ba nd -- t he husba nd of one  of
 her friends -- was t hat  guid
e  a nd he  was a me mber of t h e  
Communist Res i sta nce .  And he a
nd his ne phews  and ot her peopl e -- they were all loc al people -- 
they were smugglers, so 
they knew the moun

he was  invol ved in pas si ng

Gypsi es als o  were star ting to be rounded up -- 
who were -- they were c o mi ng -- goi ng fr om one

 And t hey woul d st op in a far m  
or t hey woul d st op in a c hurc h.  
A l ot  of l ocal  pr ie sts, count ry prie

matter if they were -- if
 pe opl e  were J e ws or -- a lot of als o were

 down.  An d so they 
had --  the y ha d li ke a c hai n, you se e.  And  
thos e or gani zations wer e  very strong.  Ver y, very st

say t hat -- t h ey had t o choos e who 
they were pas sing bec ause  they 
could be betrayed very easil y ,  
and ma ny of them were betrayed.    
Q:  We re t he r e ot her  re fugees  living i n

"Oh, t here i s  anot her Je wish fa mi ly i n  hidi ng" - -  I

Q:  But you were pret

A:  We were pretty free t o move 
until the -- that zone 
bec a me the re d zone .  
An d th en y
ou needed a 
speci al pass .  And only t he l ocal pe ople c oul d get  th

all in hiding.  We couldn
't mo ve.  From January or
 February of '43 until the 
day we left  in April the  
9th of '43, we didn't move.  We st

But  my pare nts didn't.  M y pare

A:  Not very mu ch.  Be c ause we

id well, I'm taking you,  
and the n he t old us exa ctl y what  
he  was doing.  And t he whole  chai n 
of pe ople who wer e doing that.   
So we had to -- to get through th
at -- those checkpoint. 
 So the secretary of
 the mayor of a little 
village made those passes
 for us.  And we were 
-- so we walked -- befo
re we walked in the 
mountains and that was the 
l ast  road before -- befo
re getting in the mounta
in.  And that road was 
patrolled heavily by the Ge
rmans, so we -- he was in the wine business, so we were hiding in the 
cellar the r e a nd his young boy was pl a ying in the st reet
 and he wa s wat chi ng for the patr ols.  So we 

hear d the pat r ol wal king and the  ki d wa s pl ayi ng and 
the n he say "Oka y."   So we all cr oss the  roa d  
one by one.  And then we walked -- we started to
 walk up tha t  mo unt ain.  And we wa lked for 24  
hours.  

Q:  Ho w mu ch preparation did 
you ha ve for this  journe y?   
A:  None.  None .  None .  None .  And i n retrospe ct
, it was absolutely crazy.  
Ho w we ma de it, I do n 't  
know.  Well , I know, be caus e thos

 wer e very, ver y  strong.  And 
they were able to carr y my mot her  on their back fo

nd my fa ther  
al most di ed 
there in t he mountain, of exha usti on.  Beca us e we  
walked 12 hours in the sn

saved us because the Germ
ans had a -- had a -- like
 a small -- not chalet, bu
t kind of portable, little 
-- little hut in the mountain.  And 
the weather wa s so bad that -- 
before that -- that they had  
aba ndone d it .  So we  had to walk
 there in fr ont of th
at hut  a nd nobody was  there , but  the Ger ma ns  
coul d see us  from the va lley be cause  we sa w, be
fore we le ft, we sa w pe ople wal king that sa me  

mountain and -- and was covered w

c oul d s e e, you know, the pe opl e 
walking up there.  And the Germans were          
     ever ywhe re, e ver ywhe

             day to cross into 
Spa nis h t erri tory to arre st  pe opl e whe n t here  were

Q:  What  wa s your  pl an

A:  We ha d no pla ns.  The plan 
was to go t o Spa i n a nd t he n be 
ther e.  And -- and -- a nd get a way, 
agai n, t o be one ste p a he ad of the Ge r ma ns .   We 
just didn't know.  We had 
absolutely no idea.  All 
we  want ed t o do was  be  i n
 Spain.  Be away from the 
Ger mans.  That 's all .  
Q:  So  you were arrested 
by the Spanish 
guar ds  - -  
A:  Ye s.   Ye s.  
Q.    --  what  
happe ned ne xt?   
A:  Well, they took us to

Wa y up.  It was a tin

even in uniform. 
No, t hey ha d -- the y ha d l i ke -- well  --  well , t hey ha
d ki nd of --  of -- of mili ta

Spa i n at t he ti me  was  s o poor, so
 they had no uniform and their sh

were better dressed then th

Mayor gre e t e d us a nd si nce my mot he r  and my si st er
 wer e ther e they were al lowed t o go sleep wit h 
people a nd he knocked on doors a
nd he as ked some la die s or  some

mo ther an d my  
sister spent the night in a 
bed and then all the 
men, we were -- we were sent
 to a barn.  
And they still 
had a l oca l pub ope n, a bi stro.  So

Those fo ur French guys

Les s (ph.) .  And fr om Less we t ook

 , and he wa s showi ng the  
prisoners, they -- they were dres

he was a profe ss or of phil osophy 
and that one wa s an economist,
" and stuff like that, "but 
they are bad people."    
Q:  What 's the name
 of thi s pl ace?  
A:  That place was              .  Yes.  And that's the 
tunnel              .  It finally took them I don't know 
how ma ny years to comp
lete that.  That was the 
only wa y that  they c oul d get in bet we en France --  
of in between               and Sp
ain.                is -- is -- is
 Spanish.  And it's -- it's separated form the  
rest of Spain, so during mo st of the winter it's
 so high in t he mountains t he pat h is c over ed with 
snow.  So the only way th

om France and t hat  same 
road which was  during -- 
in France -- passing in front of that 
hous e wher e we wer e in hiding would

 why we have suc h a

 That was  the only roa d goi ng t o

 That wa s the

 And I we nt ba ck t h ere and the - -  and t he -- t he Spa niar ds  devel oped

A:  That -- t hat -- that Fr ench Ar my, that 's a di ffer e

very -- how can I say that  
-- we were a very large number of Je wish boys there.
  Very large.   And th
at 's wher e we found raw, 
virulent anti-Semitism. 
 All the way fr om the top down -- 
from the t op down.  Fr om the ver y

Q:  Did that surprise you?  

A:  Yes.  Yes.  I was not prepared
 for that, at first.  But after th
at, okay, I took it for gr a nted.  And 
we were e nough J e wish boys to sti ck t oget her .  But  
it was not fun, it wa s not fun.
  We felt  very, very 
di fferent.  Very di ff

Q:  It would seem that after all 
your travails to fi nally

A:  Ye s.   Ye s.  Yes .    

Q:  Wh at wa s the general 
spir it of t he  Ar me d Forc es goi ng ba c k 
into Europe to he
lp end the war?  
A:  Well, ba sicall y, for mo
st of the people it was 
the feeli ng that t hey were
 doing what t hey wer e 
me ant t o do.  But not everybody 
was  like that, because ma ny of 
t he s ol diers of the 2nd Fr enc h 
Ar mo red  Di visio n we re dra fte d i n 
North Africa .  We  had a la r ge c ont
ingent of Ar abs fr om Algeria. 
Many of t he m c oul dn't s pea k a wor d
 of Fr ench.  An d didn't feel that 
the y had t o fi ght t he Ger ma ns .  
I don't bl a m e the m, you know.  An
d after a while, wh en so me  of 
t he  young me n who wer e dra fte d 
in Nort h Afr i ca so that t h e young 
French men wh o were liberated didn'
t try to join th
e Army or they 
had done  not hing t o li ber ate t he mse lves, the y say 
" Why are  we  dyi ng for t h e m
?"  We were perfectly 
happy in our cities of Algeria and 
fo r what, you know.  So
, I reme mber one of 
my fr iends.  He's  
dea d now, t he poor guy.  But a ft er Paris, a fter th
e liberati on of Pa ris, we  were on t he  road goi ng  

east, and it wa s the  be gi nni ng of fa
ll , and t he li beration of Pa ris ha
d bee n  -- how ca n I say that -- 
you know, t he first t w o days were great.  The n 
aft er that we  dealt with
 a popula tion whi ch had

survi ve d four yea r s of oc cupation. 
 And most  of t hos e people who ha
d s ur vive d t hose four yea r s of 
occupation had survived by 
surviving.  Which mean
s -- I wouldn't say illega
l me ans but the French, 
they have  a  word for  th
at .  They call t hat   
________ or ________.  You surv
ive.  So they had a 
mentality that 
was very, very difficult to  
accept.  So on that road he told 
me " Well, we are not volunteers 
anymor e."  And t h
at 's the way we 
fel t .  At lea st , that 's the way I felt .  I was not a 
volunteer anymo re.  And th
e enthusiasm, the sense of 
victor y t hat we felt in Nor mandy 
and getti ng int o Paris had vani she d
 tot ally.  Two weeks i n Paris ,  
that was the end of it. 
 That was  the e n d of it .  J ust 
being i n cont act wit h t hos e    
people in Paris --  
Q:  So at  that  point  what  wer e yo
u goi ng to do?   What did you t hink?   
A:  Oh, well,  I ke pt goi ng on.  
I was enlist ed --  I vol unte e
red for the durati on.  So
 -- and we still had 
a job t o do.  But we di dn't fe el like t he s uper her o, 
or Super ma n or what.  So
 j ust , oka y, let 's fi nis h  
that and go back home.  That was 
the feeling.  Then after, when it 
was all ove r, you know, first thi n g  
first, I got among th
e fir st to be disc harged when it was over .
  And I want my un
iform in a closet 
never mor e.  

Q:          
          
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  Wh ere else did you fi ght?  

A:  That 's all .  

Q:  After Paris --  

A:  Ye s.   

Q:  -- you we re just i n t h
e Ar my  but not fighting it?  
A:  Oh, ye s.  We  went  -- we  went  
all  t he wa y to Al sace .  Oh, ye s.  
Q:  An d then after France was liberated, 
the n you decide d t o sta y i n Fra nce?   
A:  Whe n I  wa s disc har g ed?   

Q:  Whe n were you disc harged?

A:  August t he 13t h, 
1945.  That's  50 year
s ago, two days ago.  
Q:  So  from liberation of Fran
ce , whic h wa s i n 1944 t hrough 1945,
 were you fighting elsewh ere?  
A:  Aft e r the  end of the c a mpai gn in Als ace , we we nt
 back into France -- into
 the cent er of France. 
That was in March of '45. 
 March, '45.  And I got a -- my fi rst -- my parent s were ba
ck in Fr ance by 
then.  They came back
 i n Fe bruary.  And so I got  a leave to 
s e e the m.  And I went bac k to Engla nd. 
They had some out fit t here taki ng car e of t he li quid
ation of what had be en the Fre e Fr enc h to get  
back into the regular Army.  And 
what e sse ntial l y was loa fi ng.  
But  ga ve me t he opport unit y t o 
come back by plan
e, which wa s fun.  Not too 
many people were flying.  
Q:  So  when did you resume  your li
fe  after all of this interruption?  
A:  Three days a fte r I got disc har ge d, went bac k to
 sc hool to fi nis h my b
accalaureat e.  And after  
that, I went  t o me dical  s c hool.  

Q:  And all t his was i n Fr ance?  

A:  All  that  wa s,  ye s.   Th e P a ris  are a .  
 But medi cal  sc hool wa
s i n Paris, ye s.  
Q:  You ha d basic ally dec i
ded to st ay i n Paris?   
A:  Yes, oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  
The onl y thing was that we we re i nvo
lved wit h Israel at the ti me, you 
see.  And they -- what wa
s it called -- I forgot what it was calle
d.  But they were 
looki ng for Je wis h  
war veterans to help the Hagana 
(ph.).  So we were like -- li ke --s
o me o f  my  frie nd s wer e  wor kin g 
with the Exodus.  Mostly those 
who ha d bee n in those  ma cqui s, 
Je wish mac qui s.  Some  were  
forgi ng pape rs and st uff like that .  And other s we r e
 carryi ng weapons .  So we
 were all more or less 
involved like that.  Arno
ld went  back to Isr ael 
be cause he wa s in the Jewi sh brigade, so he  -- and 
they di dn't wa nt hi m, t h ey s ent
 hi m bac k.  They had too ma ny pe
ople.  They ha d t oo ma ny pe opl e  
coming from all over
 the wo rld.    
Q:  Wh at we re you doi
ng to make a stand?  
A:  I was -- for a few mont hs I 
was wo rking with a group which 
was cal led _____
______.  Whic h 
was, essentially,  workin
g for aviation.  And the -- they were 
heavily recruiting pi
lots fr om Wo rld  
Wa r II.  British, Americans -- fr om
 all over.  People that had be
en in the Air Force of their

countrie s.  And the Fre nc h ha d a
llo we d the Je wi sh  Age nc y
 -- that's the name of
 it -- to use several  
airports ther e, so that 's what we were doi ng.  Hel p
i ng with that.  Taking fl yi ng les sons, a l so.  I met a  
lot of characters there.  That 's wh
en I met  my fi rst -- the first Indian
 Je w fr om I ndi a. 
 I didn't know 
that they had Jews in India at 
the time -- and was a p
ilot and I met also a pilot of the Royal Air 
For ce and a Ger man crew who came -- they wanted
 t o erase  what Ger m any had done duri ng the  

war.  They came and they had 
t heir  l og book from Worl d War 
II showing their 
mi ssi ons  and how  
good the y were.  And of course  th
ey were tur ned down.  They wer e
 cr us hed.  " B ut we  ha ve done  
not hing a gai nst t he  Je ws, and we  wa nt to he
lp.  And we  are good
 pilot s."   Yes.  
Q:  What  di d you dis cov
er about  the French at titudes after t he war?  
A:  Oh , well , e very bo dy  wa s tr yin g
 to get -- well, France had been
 heavi ly des troye
d during Wo rld 
Wa r II.  Ma ny, many cit i es ha d b
een really dest r oye d.  A l ot of Fr
enc h pe ople ha d be e n mai me d or  
killed.  More than a 
million prisoners of war ca me 
back and had to re-adjust to
 life .  So we were all 
in the s a me  boat , re-a dj usting to li fe.  And I had be en -- I  wouldn't s a y i mmunize d, but bei ng  

expose d to a  di ffere nt ki nd of anti -Se miti s m tha t  I  had e xperie nce d be fore as a tee na ger , this t i me I  

was -- my skin was thicker.  So 
going to medical school 
I found the same
 attitude.  Same
 attitude.  
At t hat  -- " T oo ma ny J e ws  are  in medical  sc hool. 
 Too many Jews are doct
or s" and et cet era, et  
cetera .  So I  we nt t hr ough me dical  sc hool a nd di
dn't ha ve t oo ma ny pr obl e ms .  And I s tarted my 
practice.  I had my  own 
practice fo r ten years.  
Q:  Wh at kind of practice?  

A:  Oh, general prac
titioner.  I was a general pr
actitioner.  And in the '60s
, anti-Semitism
 started to 
be more ta rgeted.  It was  not ju
st a general une as iness .  Pe opl e wer e bei ng targete d as Je ws.  And 
not ____________________.  The y
 were -- how can I say that?  
You we re shown that you wer e  
di fferent.  Fr ench societ y was star
ting to really become nationalistic
.  An d my understanding of that  
situation was that the most viru
l ent  colla bor ator s  and trait ors  
of Worl d Wa r II , who had bee n  
sente nce d t o  deat h or l ong jail  pe riod or eve n li
fe sentence, through amnest
y a nd so for t h, all of a  
sudden were back in t he streets. 
 And I recogni zed a few of t hem i n 
Paris, because Paris is a vill age

and you know e ver ybody.  And wit h
 t hem coming out in t he st reets 
--  ba ck -- and havi ng as muc h 
power  as be fore.  Some body li ke
 Bous cea u (ph.), who 
si gn ed the agreements
 which allowed the  
French police to be after us an
d wit hout those agr e e ments t he Ger ma ns would ha ve bee n una ble to 
arrest five Je ws in Fra nce .  Bousce au had a brill
iant career , and he was a 
friend of _________.  He  
was a friend of ___________.  And 
many of them,  many 
of them who -- so th
eir attitude about the 
Jews -- they didn't want
 to kill the Jews, no.  
No.  But their attitude 
about the Jews was the 
traditi onal at titude of Fra nce , which me ans t hat t he 
Je w -- whatever you do -- 
you c annot be Fre nc h. 
You ca nnot be Fre nc h.  To be Fre nc h your anc es t ry has t o be  -- you ha ve  to have a Frenc h na me . 

You have t o be a ______, you ha ve 
to be a _______, you ha ve t o be 
-- no, i f your na me is  Bloom or  
Bloch or Le vy, it does n't  matter i f you have live d
 in Fra nce as long as    
            and   
           it doesn't  
matt er, you are not French.  You a r e  
not Fre nch.  It doe sn't matt er i f
 you lost a le g, if your fat he r  
died in Ver d un, it doesn't  matter . 
 How ca n you be French?   You ca
n be Fre nch a littl e bit if you  
convert t o Cat holi cis m.   The n oka y, you are - -  th
ings are better.  But if
 your fat her or your 
grandfat her  wa s a  Rus sia n J ew or  a  Polish Je w, even 
i f  you cha nge  your  na me , 
eve n i f  you get  to be  
a priest, you are still a 
Jew.  Like -- what's 
his name -- the bishop 
of Paris.  He's still
 Jewish.  So --  
Q:  Did you sense that th
e French wer e angr y at  
t h e Jews for t h e war?  
A:  No.  No.  No.  No
t the people  who t hink clearl y.  No.  
The French anti -Sem
itism is really 
looking at t h e Jew as a foreign el
ement.  And when you l ook at Fr
e nch history for a  peri od of --  
going back to the 1300's un
til the 1800's -- for more 
than five hundred years 
the Jews had absolutely 
no i mpa ct in Frenc h hist ory.  The y didn't exist p
hysi call y in Fra nce .  And they had a bsol utel y no  

i mpact .  And when t he y starte d to ha ve an i mpact  on Fr enc h histor y, it was  essentiall y in the re al m 

of banking a nd big mone y.  And t hat
's why the Jews are as
s oc i ated wit h mone y, bec aus e that 's whe n 
they beca me  pr omine nt .  And i t '
s now that they are in science 
a nd medi cine  and s o forth.  
  

 -- --  

Q:        
       .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349  
38 
 
 
 
 
A:  --               and medicine and so forth.  So -- so -- so -- and the Catholic religion had always that 
teachi ng of the Jew kill ed quit e. 
 The Jew is -- and t he Jewi sh 
religi on which is
 inferi or to 
Christianity and it's -- it's -- an
d all t he symbols of the cathedral 
a nd -- a nd in Fr anc e .  All of the  
cathe dral s ha ve one  -- one of t hose    
           with culture depict
ing t he Jews as evil 
or -- or puni shed 
fr om their si ns, so it's re ally ingr ained and it doe sn't  seem that ne cessary that they --  that they will 
condom the king of 
the Jews.  Not at all.  Bu
t J e w has t o know whic h is  
his plac e or  her plac e in  
French society.  

Q:  Do you fe el di ffere
ntly about bei ng a Fre nc h
 Jew after the war than 
you had be fore?   Did it  
cha nge  your  perce pti on?   

A:  Oh, yes , of c our se .  
Oh, ye s.  Oh, yes .  Oh, ye
s.  Yes, because si nce --  
since the end of
 t he war --  
see the French popul ation befor e the war was about 
300,000 Je ws.   Mos t  of those J e ws were of  
fal ling origi n  and fi rst ge nera
tion.  And, s o t he y wer e es
sentially -- they
 were  not  --  
not merchants.  All -- all  -- if 
they were merchants they were  peopl e who were pe opl e who were  
worki ng in t he market pl ace.
  You know, they -- they -- they wer e 
-- they wer e really - -  their -- thei r  
social  -- the -- the -- economicall y 
and -- and -- and soci ally t he Jews
 t hat we  kne w were, I woul dn't  
say " poor ," but t he y wer e reall y at
 the bottom.  They we
re at t he bott om.  And a f ter t h e war we ha d 
a big infl ux of Jews fr om -- 
fr o m  east e r n Eu rope  fro m No rt
h Afri c a and -- a n d the  se con d  
generation or third generation of 
-- of the Jews born to
 Russ i a n i m mi gra n ts or  Polis h i mmi gra nts  
beca use t he  school s yst e m i s so open went t o 
higher e duc ation and al l of a sudden the y are  
engineers or              .  They are high
er r a n kin g me mb e r s o f t hat
 c o rpora tion, of the ot her  
corporati on and it creates a l o
t of resentment.  A lot of 
resentme nt.  A lot.  A lo
t.  It  cr eates a l ot of 
resent ment also i n the  Jewi sh c o mmunit y be cau
se of the inter-marria
ges , beca use of the  
convers i ons.   It -- it -- it see med
 --  see, it 's a very, very di ffic ult sit uati on.  Very, very di ffi cul t  
situation.    

Q:  So is this
 what  moti va ted you t o l e ave?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349  
39 
 
 
 
 
A:  Well , what -- what motivated 
me to leave was the feeling that 
I didn't wa nt to be on -- on the 
conti nent where that conti nent i s 
essentially a enor
mous burde n  place  for --  
for -- for -- for the Jews 
and t he Jewish cultur e.  Over -- over the centurie
s the y ha ve tot ally de stroyed our -- our -- our  
culture.  And I -- I felt that
 comi ng t o  the United State 
it's totally different b
ecause t he Uni t ed Stat es 
-- all the cult ure excepted all the cu
lt ures, ble nd.  I t 's t h
e only place in the wo
rld t hat I know where 
you go to a chur ch whic h on -- on
 -- on -- on -- on Saturday it 's a 
synagogue  a nd you have se veral  
around here .  It's the only place 
in the world wher e  you go t o a buff
e t  for a Sunda y br unch and they 
serve  bagel s and Mat zo.  I sa w t hat  in Pitt sburgh
.  On  Sunday I went down
, Sunday brunch, bagels  
and l ox and so forth and Matzo.  
And ever ybody knows what Matzo is
.  In Fra nce or Engla nd or a  
place -- any place li ke t hat it  
was  unhe ard and hear d.  it 's t h
e onl y place that I  know where on 
Chr i st ma s the Je ws are worki ng for 
the Christians, so they can stay 
home and celebrate.  It 's -- it 's - -  
and it's the only place that I 
know where anti-Semitism wa
s maybe of fervent as
 in France 50 years 
ago.  And I remember World War II and I remember talking 
t o Je wi sh --  Jewi sh GI s a nd what t he y  
were -- what  -- what they were pu
tting up with was abso
lutely similar to what
 we  were  putt i n g u p  
wit h.  I sa w t he m whe n I wa s in Engl a nd be for e  th
e end of the war t he Jewi
sh -- Jewish -- they had, 
you know, J ewi sh -- li ke  a re staurant  an
d so forth.  Jewish          
     and we we
re comp aring notes 
and -- but now it 's t otall y di ffer ent .  Totall y di ff er
ent .  I 'm not s ayi ng t hat it 's a pe rfe c t worl d. 

There's no perfect worl d, but at least t here is an effo
rt made here to -- anti-Se
mitism is consider ed as 
an ill ne ss.  I t 's not part  of societ y.    

Q:  What  ye ar di d yo
u come  over  he re ?   

A.    '64.  

Q:  Was the adjust ment difficult at
 all when you came over  here?  
A:  No .  No.   No .  No.   The  -- 
t he only t hi ng wa s the la ngua ge, bu
t I ha d the  del usi on that  I s poke  
Englis h a nd -- and I ra pidly underst ood t hat
 I had to ma ke majo
r efforts to --  
Q:  Did all of this
 st rengt hen your  se
nse of religion?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349

A:  Well, if -- if -- if you -- if
 you me a n the r eligi o n by
 goi ng t o s ynago
gue, the ritually
 and so forth, 
no.  No.  No.  No, 
but  --  but  the se ns e of Judais m I al wa ys
 ha d a nd - -  a nd -- a nd - -  a n d I ma ke  a  
separ ation, i n my mi nd at least , be c ause I was r a
ised i n a nontra diti onal  
-- I woul dn't sa y "not  
religi ous ," no.  M y pare nts were reli gious, but t h ey di dn't fol l ow the ri tual
.  They -- they -- they 
didn't e at kosher .  They didn't do 
this.  They didn't do that.  But 
-- but t h e sense that -- that -- th e 
dee p se nse  of - -  of Judai s m, we ha
ve.  I feel that 's - -  that 's much 
more important than -- than -- than, 
you know, re peati ng a pra yer just bec a use it 's a pra yer. 
 So that 's -- that 's what I 'm tryi ng to -- to -- to  
-- to follow everyday.  
Q:  What sort of long te
rm impact do you th
ink that all of these experien
ces during the war still have 
on you today?   

A:  That  -- t here is such thing as 
fate.  That things don't 
happen just like coinci
dence.  That t here is 
fat e.  Ther e is -- there is - - like gears  worki ng toge
ther and I know if -- if that di dn't -- that was not 
the case for us I don't kno
w how we  wo uld have been 
able to survive.  It 's 
a ver y strange feeli ng and 
that, i n spit e  of fa te, fat e  is not bli nd.  You have 
to hel p yours elf a l so.  That 's t he most  i mporta n t  
step.  That -- that -- you are resp
onsible for wh at happened to you 
if you don't know how to read the  
signs a round you and t ha t you ha ve  
to do.  You cannot ex
pect some body else 
t o do for  you and I  
belie ve t hat 's  ver y Je wis h.  

Q:  Do  you believe
