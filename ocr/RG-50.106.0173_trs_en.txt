. 
Q: Now let™s talk a little bit about your 
family, your parents, your grandparents. 
A: Okay , in order to unders
tand my  history, I have to
 begin with my  paternal 
grandfather. He was the first, on 
my paternal side immigrant from 
Galicia
 to the city 
of 
Kiel.
 He then helped to bring the rest 
of his family. He and my  grandmother 
Mirel, M-i-r-e-l
 had seven children. My father was the sixth child of that family. 
And my father™s name is 
Simche
, 
S-i-m-c-h-e Weber
. They ch anged his name also 
to
 Lakritz
. He was also known as 
Simon Weber, 
or
 Simon Lakritz

name is 
M a rjem, M-a-r-j-e-m
, also known as

United States
. She was

born 
Fass, F-a-s-s. 
She a-and my father were both born in 
Galicia
. They both 
immigrated  to 
Germany
 and a-arrived and lived in di
fferent city, my father in 
Kiel,
 
my  mo th er in  
Co log n e
. I was the first of three childre
n born of my parents. I was 
born, as I said, on Ju ne 1, 1934 in
 Kiel.
 After th -- me w as my sister
 Rosa, R-o-s-a 
Weber, 
and her name also was s
ubsequently changed to  
Lakritz.
 S h e was born on 
July 28, 1935 in 
Kiel
, and she died I think the first or
 second day of her -- her first 
day of her life. She is the only memb
er of the family who is buried in 
Kiel
, who has 
in fact a burial place, o the
r than my mother in the 
United States
. My brother then 
followed and he was born on September the 
second 1936 and he wa
s born also in the 
city of 
Kiel.
 That is the extent of my immediat
e family. I will go in
to the extended 
family when I™m asked. 
Q: Okay . Tell me  a little bit about your parents. What did your father do, wh at kind 

of wo rk did he do? 

A: My father worked for his father. My grandfather, 
Artur, 
otherwise known as 
Arthur Weber
, had established a business in the city of 
Kiel.
 From what I 
understand -- I don™t really know the whole natu
re of it but at -- at -- after the f -- 
end of the first World War, when he arri
ved -- whenev er he arrived in  -- in 
Kiel
, I™m 
not sure when, he established a -- a wholes
ale business, and I be
lieve initially it was 
of material after the war. In any event, he
 then changed that business to basically a

busin ess of collecting during the -- th-the 
beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting 
items that the German economy
 needed; raw material, reus
able material. And so he 
became a wholesaler of 
schmatter
 and of all types of metal 
and all kinds o-of things 
that they could recycle. And he, dur
ing the time when Jews couldn™t find 
employment, he employed many, many Jews of 
Kiel
 in this business, and they 
would go through th e streets of 
Kiel
 with a handcart and call out something. And 
I™m -- I™m relating basically what I -- wh
at I understand. And these people wo uld 
buy the used material th
at was recyclable, that 
Germany
 needed and then they 
would sell it to my  grandfather, my gra
ndfather was their employer and I guess he 
was the contributor to the livelihood of
 many, many Jews who also came from 
Galicia
 and -- like he had. And th
ey formed a 
community in 
Kiel
, which is 
important to understand, I mean the histor
y of my family, which is recorded in 
Kiel 
and in books and in theses. 
His relationship to the other 
Jews, and to his own kind of 
Jews who immigrated to 
Germany
 is important. He was a very devout Jew. A 
Hassidic Jew, and -- as I think most 
of them were when
 they moved to 
Galicia
, from 
Galicia
 to 
Germany
. And he was a me mb er of the on
e synagogue in -- in -- in -- in 
Kiel.
 And as a devoted and daily religious 
man such as my father was also, he 
belonged to that synagogue. Bu t the Jews of 
Germany
 who were integrated Jews, 
and my gr-grandfather kind
 of Jews, clashed. And th
ey clashed culturally, they 

 
Interv iew with Al

clashed religiously in th eir dress, in th
eir manner, in their form of employment, 
economically, in -- in -- in
 all the other way. So those two groups in 
Kiel
, separated. 
And my  grandfather, having a compound
 property an-and -- and a -- and a big 
warehouse, and it was a big business, anyw
ay, he created his own synagogue, and I 
take pride in the father -- in
 the fact that my grandfathe
r, whenever I™ve told that 
story, is the only person that I know
 who had his own sy
nagogue and his own 
congregation. And th at synagogue, and 
the photograph of his synagogue is 
reproduced in the books -- in the history 
books, published by the state where I was 
born and by the city of 
Kiel
, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the 
photograph of that particular synagogue 
is repeated over a
nd over, even in th e 
mu seum of -- of 
Kiel
 and -- wh ich is outside the --
 Kiel
. And it is a example, I 
suppose of that there were Jews, and that
 there was an existence. Anyway, tha -- I 
want to lead up to why this is significa
nt in my family, beca
use I come from these 
people. They  are ordinary peop
le, they are very religious 
people, they ar
e very good 
people. They  are very honest people, ha
rdworking people, family people, loving 
people. And all of these people were 
killed during the Holocaust. Thirty-one 
memb ers o f  my  fath er immed i ate  -- im
-immediate I™m -- 
I™m speaking now, 
members o f my father™s family were kille
d in the co -- various concentration camps 
of the Nazis. All of that is verified  
by documents that I have collected. And I™m

talking now of my  paternal grandfather, my
 paternal grandmother, all seven of their 
children, all seven, if any ha -- were marrie
d, and all of them but one were married -- 

all of them had ch ildren and of all of thos
e children in the -- in 
this compilation that 
I made of the records of my family, I have 
the whole family tree. I have all of their 
names and birthdates and places of where they
 were killed, and all those children but 
-- seven of those children, surviv ed. Seven ch
ildren of this large 
family surv
iv ed  th e 
war. And one of the survivor had been interned in 
Auschwitz
. He -- he is the only 
one who survived  the concen tration camp  of
 -- of all of my  immediate cousins. All 
of my  cousins otherw ise, but the other -- my
 brother and I and I think four, surviv ed. 
And the surv ival of these other cousins is 
interesting. Two or three of them went 
from 
Kiel
 o-or 
Cologne
, or wherever they were living,
 right now I don™t recall, and 
they went on the 
Kindertransport
 to 
England
, okay? Of those, one, 
Max 
Wiedman
, who is my -- also my first cousin, se
rved in the British 
army and then in 
the Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of 
Germany
. 
He served in 
Germany
 an -- as a -- an Intelligence o
fficer after the war an-and after 
-- before the 
[indecipherable]
. Two of them were in 
England
, one then emigrated 
to the 
United States
 and that™s where we stayed wh
en we first ca
me. Anyway , the 
one who survived  
Auschwitz
 then married another surv
ivor of the concen tration 
camp and they were sh
ipped out to then 
Palestine, 
and he established a sausage

store or whatever in -- in -- in -- probably in 
Haifa
 if I remember correctly. And he 
died, and one of -- and one of his child -- 
his son is the -- a -- a vice president or 
some position like that in the 
Weizmann 
Institute in 
Belgium. 
And -- 
Q: 
Weizmann
 Institute in 
Israel
? 
A: Yeah, that institute, but 
they have offices in -- in 
Belgium
 -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and 
Europe
 and he is the vice president of 
one of them. I think it™s the vice 
president of that, in 
Belgium
. Now, one of my  cousins grew up in 
Colo gne
, and sh e 
was sent by her parents to 
Palestine 
in 1937. She -- I think her name is
 Ruth
, right 
now. She became one of the early 
kibbutzim 
in then 
Palestine
. She became a labor 
leader. She was extremely active in -- in
 politics in -- in -- in -- and in the 
kibbutz
 
movement in -- in 
Palestine
. And she, like the son of the 
Auschwitz
 survivor, and 
Max Weidman
 who was in 
England
, us four were the surv
iving children of this 
family, other than my  brother. But those four reunited in 
Kiel
 when we invited by 
the city of 
Kiel
 and by the state of where -- which we
 were born, to return. So those 
four, okay . The only one of the surv
iving children who were born in  
Kiel 
who were 
not killed, was my brother
 Herbert
 and he chose not to acce
pt the invitation and not 
to go to 
Germany,
 to our birthplace.

Q: Tell me why -- let™s get back to your
 imme diate family. Why did your family 
choose to come to 
Kiel
? Was there something about th
at city particularly that 
attracted them? 
A: Okay, well, my grandfather, as I said, 
had his wife and -- and -- and six ch ildren, 
seven children at the -- you know, okay, in 
Galicia
 in this little town on the 
[indecipherable]
 I -- I can™t pronounce it. Anyway
, I have the record, however it™s 
spelled. And for some reason his family se
nt him in advance to
 go to -- away from 
Galicia
. Apparently the lines of the Jews in 
Galicia
 at that time was becoming too 
overw helming, too threatening, too wh atever
 it is and he, because he was the most 
intelligent or the best, or what -- I don™t 
know, whatever skills they gave him -- and 
he was, obviously, a great man -- he was sent to 
Germany
 -- I mean, not to 
Germany
, he was going to  
Denmark
. So, on his way to 
Denmark
 he stopped in the 
city of 
Kiel
. And 
Kiel
, he fell in love with that city. 
It™s a beautiful city, a university 
city on th e -- on the 
Atlantic
, on I think it was on the 
Baltic
 Sea -- 
Q: 
Baltic -- 
A: -- 
[indecipherable]
 
Baltic
 Sea, okay. He just fell in 
love with the city. And so 
rather than going to  
Denmark, 
which was a little bit further up, he stopped in 
Kiel -- 
Q: 
Kiel.

A: -- and he establish in 
Kiel 
and he did -- I mean, he di
d fairly well, you know, for 
an immigrant, you know, particularly on
e with the long beard, the real Jewish 
tradition, a very Jewish looking man. Inci
dentally, his photo and that of th-the 
seventh ch ild, my  uncle, is also reproduced in  the books of
 Kiel
, over and over in th 
-- in the history books and it™s the only pict
ure I have of him with his long beard. I 
have the picture of my  other grandpa
rents, my maternal grandfather and 
grandmother and they  also were of the 
same breed. Very religious. In fact, my 
maternal grandmother -- I mean the fathe r, was a -- a man  who studied the -- the -- 
the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- 
the books, I™m not sure wh
ich one right now th at he 
studied, but anyway, he studied them on a daily basis, was v -- extremely religious. 
And my mother lived
 in -- in -- in -- 
in -- in -- in 
Kiel --
 I mean, in 
Colo gne
. Now 
there™s a time when my moth
er and her family lived in 
Holland
, in -- I™ve forgotten 
now where. Now, when  that happened, I do
n™t know, but I assume  it was during the 
first World War. And why 
they then moved to 
Co log n e, 
I don™t know, I didn™t ask, 
I™m afraid, and -- but she lived in 
Holland
, then she moved as a child to 
Co lo gne
. 
She remained there until she 
met my father and they we
re engaged and they were 
married there. And th en she moved, of course, with her husband to  
Kiel. 
Q: All right. We™re -- so then they got 
married and you were their first child? 
A: I™m the oldest one, yes, I™m th e first one.

 introduced. And I believe that the -- of 
the s -- a few surviving pictures that I have
 of my family, immediate family and of 
my father and mother, I believe I have two 
things. I have their pictures that maybe 
were exchanged, possibly. Maybe that™s -- 
would explain those pi

Q: What -- what year did they get married? 
A: They got married in 1933
, in April. In their announ
cement -- I ev en have their 
little teeny announcement of their engagement, 
and the name that sh e has in the in -- 
is 
Marjem Willener, W-i-l-l-e-n -e-r
 , and that is her father™s real name, 
Willener
. 
And I have a copy of his business -- I -- 
I don™t know, since I don™t read German, 
but I have their wedding picture, I have their 
ketubah
, and I had it translated. I have 
their wedding picture and I have thei
r announcement. And the announcement of 
their -- their engagement was in January
 1933 and they  were married on the 11
th
 day 
of August 1933
, and in th -- 
Colo gne
. And it -- it says that he is the son of 
Artur -- 
Artur Weber
 and she is the son of -- I mean, she is the daughter 
Miriam, 
right, an-
and 
Marjem
 is 
Miriam

Israel
 and accord ing to  the law of 
Mo ses
 and 
so forth, and that™s wh
en they were married. 
Q: Yes, okay. 
A: Now, I don™t know what you asked me
 any mo re, but what -- you asked me -- 
Q: Well, let™s -- so now you are bo

Q: What is your very first memory? 
A: All right. Now, you were 
asking me about my -- the t
ype of people that they 
were, okay. They  were engaged, I believe in
 that fashion, they got married. I believe

absolutely completely
 that my parents were totally, 
completely in love with one 
another. Tough part is
 coming. One of the things that hurts I think the mo st about 
what happened to my family
, and I™m sure many families, 
is that they were totally, 
completely innocent, 
because they were totally good 
people. And the injustice of 
what happens to my family, 
as it is to thousands and 
maybe millions of others, who 
were just as innocent, just 
as good, just as nice, is wh
at makes, in my view, the 
Holocaust such a monstrous crime. Now, 
my parents as I said, right, my father 
worked directly for his fa
ther. A good son, a loving son. His parents, my  
grandparents were wonderful, loving, religio
us, good people. My  father and mo ther 
were tremendously good people. And they  
didn™t do an ything -- and I have to say 
this at the beginning -- anything to deserv
e anything of wh at happened to them. And 
so in this context let me tell you what 
I remember. I remember pushing my brother™s 
baby carriage and walking with 
my mother in the streets of 
Kiel
, I remember that. 
Q: What language did you speak? 
A: German. And -- both of us did. And I re
member getting lost with a girl in the 
streets of 
Kiel
, and some good people -- and we went towards the harbor, cause 
where I live was only three or four blocks
 from the -- fro m the harbor. And we got 
lost and -- and with the neighbor girl, 
and she was about my  age, I suppose -- 
anyway, and then we -- they  were -- some kind people 
found us and -- and -- and

brought us back or restored 
us to our parents. Then my
 memory in-involves a time 
when  my parents went out on an  evening a
nd -- and they  left us without a babysitter 
and I remember that I -- I to
tally obviouslypanicked, and 
I turned on all the lights. 
And maybe that was the time also that my
 brother and I were playing and I was 
jump ing on the bed and I fell and hit my  head
 against an end table in their bedroom 
and I have a little mark on my
 forehead because of that
. Now, I also remember a 
living room. In a -- in the living room we ha
d a tapestry in the wall and there was a -
- a deer and the main -- th
at was the main attribute of this tapestry, and I was 
fascinated that he kept looking at me. Wher
ever I moved, back an d forth, this guy, 
this deer, he kept looking at me. That 
was fascinating. The next thing that I 
reme mb er i s h a v i ng  
Pesach
 on the floor of our living room. 
Q: Were you in an ap artment or a house? 

A: Well, i -- i -- i -- okay, my grandfat
her™s property, a-as I recall involved, I 

believe, three buildin gs or four buildings
. But anyway, from my
 me mo ry , th ere is 
the front building, you 
know the address of 25
 Cuba -- kooba -- koober
, forgot 
anyway, its name, little someth
ing. Anyway, so we lived 
in the front building on the 
second floor. Undern eath that was the family of my  cousins, uncle and aunt, they ™re 
called 
Weidman
, right, they had several children. Th
ey lived there, 
we lived above. 
Okay . My grandfather lived over here, right
, the entrance to th
e -- to the compound

was over here, and in the back was this wa
rehouse, his big build
ing. All right. Now, 
I remember being in that apartmen t, right? 
And it was, it was an upstairs apartment. 
And in th e living room an -- we had one of the nights of 
Seder
. And my father was 
all dressed in white and we were on the fl
oor, we had pillows, and we had -- okay, I 
remember that. Now, the next thing I reme
mb er is an event that was very, very 

traumatic to me. My mo ther was hanging up new drap es that she had made for our 

apartment and sh e fell. And I rememb -- 
I remember the ambulance to take her 
away. And of course, I was three or f-four 
years old at the mo st. And I thought for 
sure they would take
 my mother away. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And it™s interesting how children pe

obviously a limited amount, and that

A: Right. The Nazis came to destroy as much
 as they could of the synagogue of my  
grandfather. And I rememb er
 looking out the window wi
th my father, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 down  and they  were burning th ings in front of the entrance to this 
compound, and I remember that. 
And I am sure that that was 
Kristallnacht
. Then I 
reme mb er, and there may have been  a separa
te day or was the same day, again my  
father and I were crouched down  the windo
w so we wouldn™t been seen, you know, 

and there were all kinds of soldiers lined up 
in front of our street there. Now, that 
may have been a different time and there 
may have been  parades that they were 
doing, but in any even t, I rememb er that. 
Q: Was that a frightening experience for you? 
A: Yes, both experiences. 
Q: Well, the burning yes, but the -- ju
st th -- seeing the soldiers marching? 
A: Yes, that was frightening. 

Q: And then  the next memo ry that I have 
is us being arrested to be shipped to 
Poland
. And this followed, I understand from history, the 
Kristallnacht 
deportation 
where the Nazis tried to sh
ip the refugee Jews in 
Germ any
 to  
Poland
. And so i -- I 
reme mb er the soldiers coming to our house 
with their gun, orde
ring my mother to 
pack, and she went an -and packed her wet 
clothes that were on th -- hanging on the 
roof, and she put them in a big bag or -- 
a duffle bag, I remember that. I remember

the soldier with his gun, y
ou know, standing there and I

soldier and the gun and th -- 
tha -- and I remember that. 
And then I remember in -- 
in this state of arrest by the German, wh
ether they were soldier, Gestapo, I don™t 
know. Then we were transported -- were arre
st -- I -- I b elieve that we spent maybe a 
night in prison, I™m not sure, but I know 
what I remember. I re
memb er being on the 
train, right, with these German Jews
 that they were shipping out of 
Germany
, and I 
remember the men -- I was with the men wh
at -- I remember. They were praying, 
they had their 
tallis,
 they were crying and we were shipped to 
Poland
 and then 
Poland
 closed its border that day.

me, of seeing men praying -- which of course
 I had seen, you know, I saw my father 
pray every day, I went to the synagogu

times, but I went there. I™m sure 
[indeciphera ble]
 in  th e co mp any  of my  mo th er. 
But here was something th at 
really struck me as a four year old child, here were 
these men standing with their tallis and th
eir hats and their yarmulkes praying and 
crying. They all understood that the Ge
rman govern ment, the German rulers had 
decided to -- because they came and arrested
 all these people, right, and said all you 

can do is take whatever, 
yo-you know, you can carry it 
in hand. You™re leaving 
everything behind, right? You™re abando
ning everything, we™re transporting you, 
we™re shipping you back 
to wh ere you belong in 
Poland
. And they  were crying. And 
to a four year old child, right, the sight of
 men, right, that obviously a child only 

understands, you know, the st
rength and the absolute of 
parents, here were these 
men crying. And I™m sure maybe my father
 was crying. And I -- this was a real 
shock to me, yes. And later I-I was told -- of
 course I didn™t understand anything that 
was going on -- later on I was told by my  mo th
er -- not then, of course, years later, 
that that day 
Poland
 had had it. It did not want to
 accept any mo re Jews being 
transported or expelled, you know, from 
Germany
 in to  th eir co un
try for whatever 
reasons they decided to do th
at. And our train, as far as 
my  mo ther is concerned, our 
train was the train that was not allowed into 
Germany
 and it was sent back. So  we 
were sent back to 
Kiel.
 Now, the second phase, right, of -- of my story has to do 
with how long, right, and this
 -- the legal system, both in 
Germany
, then in

Belgium
, then in 
France, 
came and played a part on how 
Jews were treated. And so 
I understand, right. When I was born the Ar yan laws were establish ed, right, okay, 
with all its limitation and so  forth. But I al
so wi -- and I believe, I™m informed that 
after 
Kristallnacht 
further laws were imposed and 
restrictions on Jews, you know, 
which limited their employment, their 
op-opportunity to su
rvive, you know, 
everything was done obviously
, to make it as difficult, you know, for them in 
hardship. Okay, so in
 my family, what ha
ppened is, I believe that early in this 
ballgame, the persecution of Jews was direct
ed against my family as it was ag ainst 
others, and I will tell y ou why. For some
 reason my mother became very concern 

about their -- the future. For herself and fo
r her children and fo r her husband. So  she 
wrote -- I had a great 
heeha -- 
a great-uncle, her uncle, Un cle
 Max Fass
, who lived 
in 
Oa kland, Ca lifo rnia
. And he had become a very 
successful businessman. And 
she wrote to him, and I have one of her le
tters that she wrote to him, asking him to 
sponsor us to i
mmigrate to the 
United States. 
His application was approved, visas 
and -- and our permission to en ter the 
United States
 was approved in 1935. He had 
paid for the transportation with the 
Hamburg America 
line. We had everything. 
The only thing we didn™t have is 
the final stamp of the exit from 
Germany
. 
Q: This is for the three of you, 
your mo ther, your father and you? 
A: Yes, in 1935.

Q: Yeah. 
A: That™s before my brother was born. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And the little bit that I™m to
ld over the years, the stor
y is something like this. My 
parents, of course, lived in 
Kiel
. They had to  go to  
Ha mburg
 to get these exit visas 
stamped and approved. I believe that the st
ory is this, is that my father, being a 
religious Jew did not on the 
Shabba s
 or on th is 
[indecipherable]
 holiday, carry any 
money. And so he didn™t know, as smart as
 he was he did not know that they would 
require some payment for the exit permit. T h at™s what I understa
nd. He did not have 
it. So he asked them wh en he found out,
 I™ll come back tomo
rrow when I can bring 
money. I have money. They  had everything, okay, including the 
Ha mb urg
 line, you 
know, confirmation, you know, wh -which I ha
ve a copy of. Okay . 
The Nazi said no. 
Okay , now you have to unders
tand, I was born in the city that I believe was one of 
the ultra-nationalistic Nazi cities, that™s wh
at I believe. That was where all the you -- 
the German si -- 
U-boats
, submarines were located. Th
at™s where German armament 
ships an-an-and submarines were manufactur
ed, I believe that by slave labor, right, 
who were gathered from whereve
r. I believe that was owned by 
Kru p
, okay, I am 
not certain, but I am. Okay . In -- if I spoke
 and read German I could tell you better, 
you know, than wh at I believe. But among th
e books that were given to me by the

city of
 Kiel
 -- you know, they proudly displayed,
 you know, their pre-World War II 
history, their World War II history and the 
post-World War history. And my  family 
is there in the pre-war, my 
-- my  cousin s, you know, in  the -- in the Hebrew schools 
are all over, you know, in their book. Thei
r pictures are all over, hanging in the 
mu seum of 
Kiel
, which is outside the city, you 
know, gigantic photographs of 
members o f my family. In fact, 
Max Weidma n
, when we were going touring that -- 
that -- that museum, he said 
to me, see, that™s my picture, that™s me. He says, how 
could it be that I™m in a 
museum? We™re looking at my face on the wall? That is 
abnormal. Anyway , but seven of my  cousins 
are in these photographs in th e Jewish 
schools of 
Kiel. 
Okay, that™s -- all right, now le
t™s see, w h ere was I? Oh -- 
Q: Can you -- can we just -- can you ju st 
take a diversion now and tell me why the 
names are different? 

A: Yeah, my name -- 

Q: Your name. 
A: -- okay, yeah, okay. I was telling 
you what I believe, right, was a -- a 
concentrated effort by the Nazis, you know
, to intimidate, to hum
iliate, to debase, to 
deprive Jews in the city of 
Kiel
, you know, of -- of a normal
 living and so forth. And 
that had started, and that™s where it was at
. It started early in the ballgame, because 
our denial of exiting 
Germany
 in 1935, when we had everything approved by the

 an-and e-e-everything, right, was de
nied because he was in the -- an 
observant Jew and he 
did not carry money. And th ey di
dn™t give him the opportunity 
even to come back the next day when  he 
would bring it, okay. 
I don™t know of any 
indecency, you know, that™s 
greater than to deny somebo
dy even their right to 
religious observance. And that™s
 what that is. Okay, now the next story is a story th at 
is also very personal to me, and it is part 
of this pattern. I believe that it became part 
of the -- our request to immigrate in -- in
 1935 in -- I believe. I am n o t a hundred 
percent certain, but I am 95 minimu m certain 
that the Germans demanded, as part of 
the exit permits and identi -- 
they demanded a copy of th e birth certificate of my  
father a-and since he was born in 
Galicia
, a -- what I understand is that these people 
who -- who -- these Jews who lived in 
Galicia
 in these small little hamlets or 
villages or whatever it is, that the -- 

Q: 
Shetls? 
A: -- y-yeah, that the only 
marriage that they had was 
a religious marriage. They 
were all religious, okay, and the record of 
their marriages and birth were recorded in 
the synagogues, but not -- they didn™t ma
rry civilly in that area. Now, in 
Germ any
 
the requirement is that you marry civilly 
and religiously, but that the only marriage 
which is valid and recorded and recognized
 is the civil marriage. Well, I™m giving 
credit to the bastards, okay? No , no, I ha
ve better words for them, but I am giving

22
this much as a lawyer, right? A little bit of 
credit that -- th-that th
ey used the law to 
then follow up and do th e following monstr
osity. They  demanded, I believe, this 
evidence, th e eviden ce that 
my  -- my  father™s birth certificate. Now, I don™t know 
that he had any kind of evid
ence, so they -- he didn™t 
have it, let™s assume, okay, 
because obviously he wasn™t ci
villy registered at his birt
h. So then th
ey demanded 
proof that his parents were civilly married
 and they had not been, apparently. So 
what they did is this: they demanded of my 
grandfather th at he sign an affidavit, and 
I have a copy of it. I have the original an
 -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it. 
And in th at affidavit, okay I cannot de
scribe totally every word, but what I 
understand from this affidavit that he was fo
rced to sign, he was forced to say that 
my father was his bastard child. Remember, 
this was the sixth child of his wife and 
himself, right? This is a devout, you know
, couple. My -- my grandmother didn™t 
even have her -- you know, she followed 
the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of 
wearing, you know, a wig. I mean, this is
 about as gross a monstrosity, you know, 
other than  -- to debase human being, right. 
And this affidavit that I have a copy of, 
right, attests to the fact that his son 
Simche
, right, is his bastard child. So now, what 
they did is they for
ced a -- a -- a family
 name change of my
 father, my mother, 
my self and my  brother. No, not my  brother. 
No, he wasn™t born 
then. This was in 
1935. So my pursuit and obse
ssion is, to some degree it 
is to know who we were, 

 
Interv iew with Al

23
what we were, where we come from, you 
know, wh-why -- who were we. Who were 
these people who were killed in this unjus
tified manner? So I, in
 1988 went to the 
consulate of 
Germany
 in 
Los Angeles
 and I was received by -- and I explained to 
them on the telephone -- and I explained 
to whoever I-I spoke 
to, and I suppose it 
was the legal officer on the -- of the consulate, what I was after. And what I was 
after in 19 dia -- ™88 is the beginning of my  
pursuit to try to prov
e what happened to 
my family, so that I could understand, so th
at I could know, but also so that I could 
tell my wife, my children and my grandchild
ren and so  on, whatever future we have 
in this earth, of what happened to  their 
fore-parents and how wrong this was and 
how this should never happen ag ain, to anyb
ody. So  I went to the consulate, I was 
received with extreme courtesy, both by th
e legal officer and the vice-consul. Both 
were extremely nice to me, I -- and I explai
ned to th em who -- of course, who I was, 
an-and wh at my  interest was, you know, 
and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in 
Los Angeles, 
they were extremely professionally
 connected to me. They were 
connected also intelle
ctually, I mean, they -- you kno
w, and they  were young, you 
know, people, as I  was.  And so our discu
ssions were very frank. And so they asked 
me a little bit of my history and I told 
them, you know, where I come from, w h ere 
my  family comes from, you know, and what
 happened. And so they  se -- I told

them, what I want to do is to
 establi -- I want a copy of my  original birth certificate. 
I want to know why my  name was changed. 
Q: From -- 
A: From 
Weber,
 which was the name of my fa
ther, right. His father, right, 
originally  was born by the name of 
Weizner
. He, when he went to  
Germany
 
changed it to 
Weber
. Now, I-I will tell you how horribl
e this is. In the documents 
that I later obtained 
from the city of 
Kiel, 
the records of the city of 
Kiel
, when he 
bought his different parcels, different l-
land ac-acquisition to build this compound, 
the record -- the record, you know, is th
ere, you know, of his name, of his changed 
name and so forth. 

Q: From 
Web e r
 to 
Lakritz
? 
A: From -- no, from my grandfather, from 
Weizner 
to
 Weber. 
Q: Oh, 
Weizner
 to 
Weber
, right. 
A: Right, okay, but from th
en on he is referred alwa
ys, you know, from 1914, 19 
whatever it is, you know, in 
those records thro ughout, he™s always referred to as 
Artur Weber. 
Q: 
Weber. 
A: Always, always. Never was his name chan
ged, never. So when  
I ask that my -- I 
wanted a inquiry  and obtain the -- the -- my  birth certificate, and wh y was my  name

changed? So the German consulate, what 
they  did -- and I coul
dn™t speak German, I 
couldn™t write German and I didn't  know wh
at to write. So they
 were absolutely 
wonderful to me. They handwrote the lette
rs, and they, you know, o-of -- of who I 
should write to. So 
then  I brought it to my  secretary and she didn™t speak German 
any more than me. Anyway, 
we pounded away, you know
, the letter and we mailed 
it to 
Kiel
 with the proper money that they told  me I should send, and I did send it. 
Then -- and they -- th
ey said to me, those two guy
s, they said, you know, the 
German nation, the German people did many 
horrible things to th e Jews, but that it 

didn™t do. And I said, okay, I want to find ou
t if they did or didn™t do. So I sent for 
the information and I received informati
on back. And the information I received 
back from 
Kiel
 is my  new birth certificate and 
tw o ju dgments of two courts in 
Kiel, 
Germany.
 One of them is a police court, and one 
is a -- another kind of court, a civil 
court, and both of them are 
judgments ordering the name 
change of my  parents and 
myself from the last name of 
Weber, 
which was our name, to 
Lakritz.  
Q: So you were -- o-on your or
iginal birth certificate it said 
Weber
? 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And then they changed it to 
Lakritz -- 
Q: To 
La krit z.

A: -- okay. And I will tell you in  a second 
why, but anyway, these two ju dgments 
not only ordered the name change, but they 
also named the judgments in order that 
my  parents were forbidden to use the name of 
Weber
 under penalty of 
imprisonment and imprison -- and -- and fines,
 something li -- to that effect, okay, 
and ag ain I have limited -- 
I have no understanding or 
knowledge of the German 
language, so I -- but I have the documents. 
So once I had the judgments, I called the 
legal officer and I had a second meeting w
ith them and I showed them. And they  
couldn™t believe it, that now I had the ju
dgments of the two German courts, right, 
where I was born, right? My father was raised in 
Kiel
, educated in 
Kiel
. They were 
living th ere and my  grandfathe
r had property there and my  
God, they were about as 
honest a people as they obvio
usly could be, comp ared to their comp arative and their 
contemporaries. And they said they couldn™t believe it, that this had officially been 
done. And th ey said well, you know, I mean
, there™s nothing to it, you know, just 
change your name back. And so I said, I don™t know if I can do it, and I don™t know 
that I™m allowed to do it. I don™t know that
 my brother will agree to do it. I don™t 
know what I can do.  

Q: Where did the name
 Lakritz

grandmother™s name.

the marriag e between my grandfather and 
my  grandmother and th ey  said, okay,

Artur Weber --

Q: Is your mother --

. O k ay, 
La kritz
, incidentally, in German 
means licorice, you know, wh ich is a favorite candy in 
Germa ny
, particularly in the 
north ern part and also in 
Denma r k 
and
 Sweden. 
And I had a story to tell about that, 
but anyway -- but 
La krit z
 is the family name , okay. And my  brother, when I had the 
evidence and I asked him in front of his ch
ildren and my  children, come on, we can 
change our name. And he says, it™s too late
. By then, of course, we were grown men 
with our own ch ildren and -- and -- and he 
says, you know, our name and our history 
is fixed, you know. So we didn™t, and I ha
ven™t. But this is something I carry with 
tremendous resentment. I have resented th
at they ch anged my  name. I resent it 
today, I si -- resent it every day. This is 
one of the burning things that burns to me. 
So th-the fact that they denied employment,
 that they denied ex
it, that they denied 
my  name, that they imprison us and want
ed  to deport us with anything and th at 

ultimately the only thing left was for us to
 escape, which they 
did -- we did, of

course i-illegally from 
Germany
 into 
Belg ium
. These were the beginning of part of 
the picture, I believe, that affected 
of course, many, many Jews, right, many 
ordinary Jews. We were ordinary  people, ri
ght. And this is the beginning of my  life. 
And it is something that I have to say, th
at I am sure has marked my personality and 
my attitudes and maybe my choice of prof
ession and my relati
onship to wife and 
children and others, because I believe that a 
child who is treated in this way, and in 
what follows, including th e two 
years of being hidden  in 
France
 and th inking we 
had been -- we had no longer 
had any parents, I believe that
 this is one of the most 
monstrous of crimes that™s committed. The 
rapes and the killing that is done and was 
done, and is done today, right, against i-
innocent people, you know, in different 
parts of the world I won™t name now, but 
-- but we™ve had several genocides and one 
or two are going on right now.
 The aftereffect of what this has to those people who 
are the victim is something that unfortunate
ly is not understood, maybe rightfully so, 
and is not, I think, shared. And I don™t thi
nk it™s gi -- ging -- giving credit to these 
poor people. So it™s not just because it 
happened to me, but I am speaking, you 
understand that, for them, you know. It was re
al for me, it is real for me now and it 
will be real for them, you know, 
whether they are over there in 
Africa
, you know, or 
in 
Asia
 where it happened, or in other places. 
So we should not and cannot think of

 have occurred simp ly  in the numbers,

 This is tape number two, side
 
A.
 You are now back  in your house again, in 
Kiel. 
A: Okay . Incidentally, I did not spell my  
bother -- my -- my father™s birthplace. If 
you want I can spell that, if it™s important. Anyway -- oh, we™re back -- 
Q: You -- yeah -- 
A: -- in my -- 
Q: -- you were supposed to be going to  
Poland
, but then you -- you did not, you 
came back to 
Kiel. 
A: Well, they -- they -- they -- 
wen -- they -- we weren™t going to 
Poland -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- we were forcibly arrested -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- forcibly attempte

Q: -- ported. 
A: -- and were not deported --

Q: Right. 
A: -- closed their border that day to our 
train. So, a miracle happened, as several 
others happened to th ose who surv ived . 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Right. But then you 
said your mo ther knew th
at it was time to leave. 
A: Time to leave, yes. And so she, I™m 
sure, was very instrume
ntal to convince my 
father, you know, look, a-as difficult as it is
 to leave our family and -- and our -- and 
y-y-you know, our place in 
Kiel
, you know, with family
, we have to  protect 
ourselves, we have to  protect our children, 
we have to leave this hellhole. Because 
life obviously, in 
Germany
 had become a hell for thes
e remaining Jews. And th e 
future, you know, offered to 
my  parents obviously, nothing but bad and despair. So 
my father, who obviously was a very loving 
father -- I mean son to his father, you 

know, I™m sure with great pa
in, you know, this time, left. 
And th is time without the -
- the dream to go to  the -- to the dreamland of 
California
 and its golden paved 
streets. I™m not saying he believed that, but
 I™m just saying that that was the -- the 
rosy image I™m sure, th at must have 
prevailed at the time. Anyway, I mean, 
something convinced 
my mother to a-ask my -- he
r uncle for the visa to exit 
Germany
 and obviously my  father consented.
 And so i -- i -- you know, obviously 
in 1935, life and its future for a young coup
le was such that they had decided th at 
they had to uproot.

Q: But now we™re at 1938. 
A: I understand. 

Q: Okay . 
A: So now there is a to tally
 different set mind or -- or -- or mindset, forgive me, of 
my parents. Now it™s si mply, 
purely not a matter of choice or -- between degrees, 
right. No w it™s a matter of life and death, 
and they understood that. So , to protect 
their children, right, they smuggled -- 
they paid for bein g smuggled out of 
Germany
. They  left property behind, their pare
nts, his parents, family, everybody 
behind to  do that. No w, this is important to
 demonstrate the character of my parents. 
At that time they did everything they coul
d to save their children and they left to 
protect and to save their children, not to
 save themselves.  An
d again we see the 
same repetition of their actions in August
 of 1942, and the title of th e movie, one 
movie was, ﬁ
Into the Arms of Strangersﬂ,
 they are the abso
lute example of 
sending their children into the 
arms of stranger, of an unknown, to save them. And if 

they had not done that we 
would all have perished in 
August 1942 when  they  were 
arrested and put in concentration camp in 
France. 
Q: Okay, we-we™ll get to that, let™s 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Now, I unde-understand, but the things ha
ve to tie if they do tie. And the type of 
people that my parents were, as other peop
le™s parents were, who attemp ted to save

their children, even at the pe
ril of their own lives is one 
of the recorded evidence of 
what happened to people. At some  point 
some people actually had a choice, and the 
choice was made to save the children. And I 
am one of those. I am an -- a survivor 
solely because of that, only because of th
at. Only because my parents, right, knew 
they were helpless, I -- w
ithout means to have any other choice. They knew that 
others had mo re choice than they. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And so here are two connect, right, 
between the events of us smuggle -- 
smuggling into 
Belg ium
 to the one that will 
follow when we™re in 
France
. 
Q: Okay , so you left your house in 
Kiel
? 
A: Right, and we were -- 
Q: And do you remember -- 

A: -- smuggled -- 

Q: -- do you rememb er then? 
A: No.

A: No, no, no.

A: We were in the city of
 Antwerp
. We lived in the city of 
Antwerp,
 again in an 
apartment. I have vivid mem -- very vivid memo ry of 
Antwerp
. I have a memory of 
my  father lecturing me on how I was 
not learning Hebrew well enough in 
kindergarten. I remember 
that. I remember h e -- 
Q: And this was Septembe
r 1939 that you went to 
Belgiu m
? 
A: I -- I™m not -- 
Q: Okay . Approximately. 
A: I can™t -- I can™t say that it was September. I know that we live in 
Antwerp 
for at 
least six months, I know th at. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I know that we were forcibly -- had to
 leave, along with thousands and th ousands 
of other 
Belg
 to flee the German bombing. That was at th e beginning of May -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- 1940. So the only esti
mation that I -- I -- I -- I have is that I know th at my  
mother said to me, you know, we were in 
Antwerp 
about six months. That™s what I 
recall, and I could be 
very wrong. It -- 
Q: Did you go to school there?

well enough. Oh y
eah, yeah, I -- I -- 
Q: Do you remember that
, him telling you, or not? 
A: I -- yeah, oh, I remember him telling me, oh, for sure. I remember him telling me, 
scolding me, you know, in wh atever way he
 did it. I remember more than that, of 
course. I rememb er the songs. We were l
earning Jewish songs and I don™t know, 
whatever it is, I wasn™t learning the al
phabet well enough, I wasn™t learning the 
songs well enough, I -- there 
was something I didn™t -- 
Q: Can you sing one or two lines of a song? 

A: No, I -- right now -- it™s somet h ing abou

the fire. It was something around the fire -- 

Q: Right.  

A: -- or fireplace. I don™t remember it now 
[indecipherable]
. But anyway that was 
one 
[indecipherable]
 I mean, God, th-there were 
many others, I™m sure. In any 
event, if you want to know my  recollection that I have of 
Antwerp,
 the -- they™re 
interesting too. I rememb er going to a synagogue with  my  mo ther, upstairs right, we 

were there, I remember that. I re
memb er one time seeing a funeral in 
Antwerp
 and I 
had never seen such a thing.
 And here was this horse dr

this hearse in bl

reason, was walking on the street b y  myself
 and I saw this, I was fascinated and I 
remember watching it. I reme
mber that. I also remember 
that we lived upstairs in 
this apartment in 
Antwerp
 and there was one time I was with my  father and going 
down stairs and he didn™t rea
lly want me to look at wh at was there. There was blood 
on the walls, and I was curious, I say what di -- what di -- what -- you know, why is 
there blood in the hall? And my father, 
he -- he -- he was fumbling, I think to 
explain to  me that a man living in the bui
ld ing had an accident and he fell down the 
stairs and you know, obviously  he had a bad scene. 

Q: Right. 

A: But anyway, so the struggle of my  fath
er trying to protect his son, you know, 
from a horrible scene, you 
know, again it underscores,
 you know, the tremendous 
humanity, you know, of people ev en in 
the worst of circumstances. Anyway, I 
reme mb er my  mo th er™s sist

Cologne
, she -- they had fled 
in 
Mathus
 and 
Anver. 
Q: Did your -- did your mo ther ever tell you later why they went to  
Antwerp
? 
A: No. 

Q: You -- so you don™t know -- was it 
the resistance that 
got them out to 
Antwerp

A: -- no, no, no, no. My father had become
 nervous and easy for him to get upset 
and I rememb er him scolding me about th
e way that I was making too mu ch noise 
eating. So I -- th-there™s no question that my
 father was a changed person, in  that the 
events wh ich follow, you know
, created mo re of a change in him, but not towards 
my mother, not towards his children, but 
the way he behaved an
d -- and he would 
get angry easily, something that -- that was to tally strange to me, an d so this is part 
of th-th-the whole episode.  
Q: When  you were in school in 
Antwerp 
with the other little Jewish children -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- they were just -- you were
 just playing like little children. 
A: Yeah, there was nothing. 

Q: Yeah, nothing to  indi

A: Nothing, no, nothing. 

Q: Okay , now it™s May 1940. 
A: Okay, now, before it -- y
eah, it™s May 1940, okay -- 
Q: What happened? 
A: -- and I remember the following. I reme
mber my aunt and uncle coming to say 
goodbye to us, okay, and I-I 
don™t remember if they ca

probably  did, but I -- you know, I assume
 that. But anyway, I reme mb er them

specifically looking down, yo
u know, from the second story, third story of this 
build ing that we lived in and lo oking at th
em and saying goodbye. Of course -- I 
shouldn™t say of course, but that the last th
at we ever saw of them, the four of them. 
And they  were leaving and we
 shortly were also leaving 
Antwerp
, so were others. 
And I assume, but I™m not certain that the 
city had already been bomb ed, that the 
bombing had started by the German Air Fo r
ce. But in any event I know from later, 
these people, my  aunt and uncle had a you
ng daughter, n -- and not to depart, but at 
least to -- and th at daughter 
was left with a couple in 
Holland
. Why -- I don™t know 
all the circu mstances. My cousin, her name is 
Adele Mendelssohn
, and she is alive, 
and she is in -- she™s older than me but no t by that much. And she was hidden by this 

family in 
Holland
, a Christian family in -- who ha
d another girl, right, a daughter, 
you know. And they , throughou
t the war saved my  cousin 
Adele
, s-saying publicly 
that this was th-their second
 child, you understand, and th
ey raised er -- er -- you 
know, both children. Sh e survived the war. After the war my uncle, 
Michael Fass,
 

who went in our place when 
we couldn™t go in 1935 to 
Oakland
 to emigrate, then 
my great-uncle sponsored my -- her br
other, my mother™s brother, my Uncle 
Fass
, 
and they, the whole family emigrated, went to 
Oa kla nd
 in our place. And -- so after 
the war, when 
Adele
 was left er -- as total -- as 
an orph -- orphan, they -- Uncle 
Mike
 sponsored her and th ey got her to emigrate to 
Oakland
 and she lived with

them until she married, and -- which I 
witnessed, and she still lives in 
Oakland
. 
Anyway, so she survive in
 that manner. And how and 
why she was separated from 
her family, I don™t know, I-I 
only know that she was. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And I know that she was raised 
and saved by this Ch ristian couple in 
Holland
, 
whom she has honored in many, many wa
ys, including designating them as the 
righteous -- as Righteous Jews. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Which they deserve. 
Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, we™re leaving.  
Q: Where -- you™re leaving. 
A: Okay, we™re leaving 
Antwerp
, okay. What I remember is being on the train and I 
reme mb er hearing bombing, all right, that I 
didn™t understand, right, but I rememb er 
distinctly, you know, as a child. I am now five and three quarters -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- years of age, right, and I remember 
hearing the bomb ing. Then  the next thing 
that I know is we land in the city called 
Marm ande, M-a-r-m-a-n-d-e

. It™s in the department of 
Lot-et-Garonne. 
It is very close to the 
Dordogne
, to 
Bergerac.
 It is very close to 
Bordea ux
 and the wine country, and 
there™s a very agricultural, beautiful part of 
France
 and that I love greatly. And we 
end up in  a big warehouse, 
that™s what I remember. 
And I remember we were 
sleeping on straw, and hundreds -- 
Q: This is the four of you? 

A: Yeah, the four of us. The four of us
 lan -- and we, among ot
her other other -- 
maybe a few hundred people
 who fled with us from 
Belgium
 were housed in this 
warehouse, and sleep there 
and provided so me food, you know, I™m sure. And by 
God™s choice, later on, after the war, my mother
 is able to rent an apartment which is 
right across the street from this wareho
use. And th ere™s another coincidence of 
significance in my  history th at also happens -- 

Q: Did you know what was ha
ppening as this almo st six year old ch ild, what -- what 
was

A: Well, you know -- 

Q: Again that sense of 
danger, that sense -- 

A: A-And th at -- let me tell you, the only 
thing I can rememb er, all right, and what 
follows has significant emotional feelings. 
I knew things were wrong. I knew things 
were not right. I knew things that whatever
 stability was born into this world, and I

was, I was in a very stable family and 
environment, and I th
ank God -- this was no 
longer stable. Of course I didn™
t understand the circumstance -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- I didn™t understand th e enormity of
 what was happening to us. But in the 
botto m line of what was happening to us
, must be recorded. We, along with 
thousands and thousands of 
Belg
, fled 
Belgium 
because of the invasion of the 
German armies into 
Holland
, into
 Belgium
, and 
Luxembourg. 
They ultimately 
went back  home to their homes and to thei
r businesses and th eir jobs and so forth 
and families. We remained. We were tota
l and absolute refugees. We were total 
stateless people. We had tota
lly no rights. We had no 
property, we had no money, 
we had nothing. We had no rights. 
And we were able to remain in 
France
 only by 
police authority and permits, which had to
 be renewed every 30 days. We were 
living th e life of people who have no rights
 to be, to live, to aspire, to hope, 
anything. We were returned to a state 
where you are now totally dependent on the 
whim, the laws, the rudity, the -- the -- 
the anti whatever is, you know, whether -- 
that existed at 
France
 at that time. Obviously I di
dn™t understand all of that.  
Q: Right. 

A: Obviously I didn™t know the history of 
France
, I had no knowledge of why we 
were even there. I didn™t understand a
nything. Bu t what follows is I began to

understand that we were not very  stable, th
at we were not -- and yet, I was stable. I 
had a mo ther and father who were the marv
el -- marvel o f the world. And I had a 
brother, and of course we were the boys 
and we lived in -- as boys do. I have two 
beautiful, magnificent grandsons and I see 
them growing up and I was no different, 
you know, in terms of figh
ting and playing with each other, you know -- you know. 
And my brother and I were magnificent as -- 
as brothers. So the fact that we had 
each other and I wasn™t an only child was ve
ry important. The fact that we had such 
loving, caring and responsib le and protective parents was 
[indecipherable]
. But the 
truth of our lives were really terrib le. A
nd so from this wareho
use, living on straws, 
the others left, and I experienced this ab
andonment again and ag
ain in my life. We 
remained. And I don™t know how, but anyway
, they allowed us to
 have an apartment 
and my  father went as a labor
er to work for the city of 
Marm ande.
 And he was a 
healthy guy and he was strong 
and he was able, and -- not that he was very big, he -- 
I™m sure he was a little bit shorter than
 me, but about th e same height. And I 
remember one of the things that he wo
rked  on. And he work ed on setting up th e -- 
the -- in the -- in the plaza, a big plaza in -- in  
Oakland
, called the 
Plaza de Marie
, 
where we later on lived -- 
Q: In
 Oa kla nd

Oakland

Marmande -- 
ma -- no, no, this is 
Marmande,
 okay. And he helped to erect, you 
know, the -- the -- the -- the wa
lls that was -- that were to
 surround this celebration. 
And this celebration was one of th
e games of the German and the 
Vichy
 
government. In this little city of 15,000
 people, thereabouts, there was to be a 
nationalistic event to celebrate how 
France
, right, had a future and 
France
 survived 
and 
France
 was in honor in f -- in spite
 of its defeat, in f -- in 
spite of its -- that they 
had cu t th-the country  in God knows what, the portion. The 
Vichy
 govern ment was, 
of course, the southern parts of -- of 
France
. I was then in the 
Vichy
 government 
section of
 France
 and 
Germany
 had taken say two-th irds a-
as far as their dependent 
state. And that 
Vichy
 govern ment supposed ly was an independent part of 
France
, 
okay. Under the 
Vichy
 government, 
Vichy
 is simply because th
at™s where the -- the 
government of 
Marshal Petain
 was allowed to -- to be. There™s two parts to this 
story, neither one of them good, about 
France
. This prefect, or this government 
employee came to this city fo
r this national celebration, 
and what was the purpose of 
it? The purpose was to invigorate the people , that their lot, being a defeated people, 
conquered people now, under the boot of
 the Germans, whom 
they hated, right, 
whom they had fo ught in 
two wars, in the 1870 wa
rs and the 1914-18 wars. 
France
 
-- French people did not like the Germans, the 
bo che
 they called them, that™s the

hated term, right, equal to the pigs. Now, th e pigs, the 
boche 
now were in charge of
 
France
, and they had taken two-th irds of 
France
. They had taken, you know, the 
big city, 
Paris
 in the north and then all the industrial wealth and the coal, and all of 
the -- the -- in the east, 
Normandy
 and -- and -- and -- and th -the glory. And they 
left a little southern part, which was ag
ricultural, you know, an
d wine country  and 
then the 
Côte d™Azur
 and then the access to 
Spain
. Basically a region without 
power, without economy , other 
than agricultural, and you 
know, where th-there was 
not th-th-the great population, 
you know, that you have in 
Paris
, and with 
Lyon
 and 
so forth, so forth. Okay, now, this guy 
came for one purpose and that purpose was to 
reinvigorate these people out of the sense of
 defeat and so forth,
 and they had this 
big celebration. So  my  father was one of 
those employed to set this party up, okay. 
What followed either preceded 
this or followed this is 
the imposition now of French 
laws, which equaled and in some ca -- exceeded the anti-Semitis
m of the German 
laws. Now, as a lawyer, you know, throug
hout my  history, and the purpose of my  
giving th is testimony is not merely to rela
te, you know, pain an
d suffering and death 
and numbers. It is to relate the context. 
The context, what happened, right, to th e 
Jews of -- of my family, is the persecuti on, the anti-Semitism, the hate, right, the 
monstrosity, right, that they created. Th
e Germans created, right -- these guys 
fantasized and invented a system of s

you don™t want me to talk, but it is important
 in my part of the story that now French 
laws follows and equates, right, in its 
anti-Semitism and a -- and its limitation on -- 
on -- on the rights of Jews, and certainly ab
solutely on the rights of immigrant Jews. 
And in 
France
, with a history of anti-Semitism, of
 Catholicism, of teaching of the 
hatred of the Jewish people, right. We were the damn ed people, the condemned 
people, even though we were
 the -- the creators of thei
r religion and supposed ly, you 
know, ours was the-the-their chosen God,
 you know. Anyway, th
e French, not just 
in the 
Dreyfus 
Affair, but had a history of anti-sem -- Semitism and that history, 
even though it was not, you know, on the su
rface, it existed in 
reality. And I became 
now a part of that history. And my  history 
is how these people dealt with all of these 
formulas, all of these factors 
that were facing them, the 
Christian, right, French. And 
I now am in this milieu, in this -- and ho
w these people deal with the world as it™s 
evolving out of their contro l, and the mini
ma l amount of their choice, or the choices 
that they make either actively or passively, 
with regard to people like me, is part of 
the reflection of their religious education, 
their family education, right, and their 
laws. And th e laws of 
France
, to the shame of 
France
, right, went to adopt German 
anti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to 
the Germans the right 
to dictate to the 
Vichy
 
government what the French 
police, the French states 
and the Fren ch functionary 
would do to the Jews, particular
ly the refugee -- refugee Jews.

Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Alfred Lakritz
. This is tape two, side 
B, 
and 
you were telling about
 after May 1940 -- 
A: Right -- 
Q: -- in
 Marmande -- 
A: -- okay, now -- 

Q: --
 France. 

A: -- what I remember is I said
 is my father working to se
t up this fête, they call it -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- in
 France
. And I also remember a little th
ing like I remember walking and 
smelling the roses. I rememb er being fasc
inated by snails af
ter the rain. And I 

remember one lady telling me to go collect sn
ails for her and I did, and so sh e gave 
me some money. And again, an act of ki
ndness that again I wa -- re-repeated later. 

Anyway, that™s what I 
reme mb er b asically  o f  
Marmande
 and I remember where 
that apartment was. Again it was an upstairs
 apartment. I know 
that it was close to 
the tomato -- toma
to factory.  
Q: Mm-hm.

A: 
Marmande
 is a city that is fam
ous for its tomato, and the 
Ma rmande
 tomato 
was very, very famous in 
France. 
Q: Hm. 
A: In fact, on the -- on the streets of 
Paris
 where they sell the produce, my brother 
said that he found, you 
know, stands that said 
Marmande
 tomato, and later on I 
found out that in th
e recent years they change the 
tomato, an -- an d anyway -- to 
accommodate machinery. But in
 any event -- yeah -- bu
t anyway, that™s what I 
reme mb er ab ou t 
Ma rmande
. But then comes a change. We
 are no lo nger allowed to 
live in 
Marm ande. 
We are now forced to take up 
residence in the little hamlet 
outside of 
Marm ande
, seven or eight kilo meters from 
Marm ande
. And this little 
hamlet is called 
Saint-Pard oux-du-Breuil. 
Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil 
now is of 
important development in my 
memory because then I really
 understand. My eyes are 
open, I really rememb er, I really see. 

Q: How old are you now? This
 is when ? This is -- 
A: This is sometime in  the 1940, I mean, or ™41. 

Q: Okay .  

A: I believe it™s in the 40™s. I 
-- I don™t think that we live in 
Marmande
 very  long, 
because the city, the police, would not allo
w us to stay there longer. I don™t know, 

but I suspect that because -- a
nd I suspect this because of th
e fact th at I learned when

I visited 
Saint-Pardoux 
again -- and I™ve done that several times after the war, I 
learned then that there were several Jewish 
families in -- th
at lived around
 or in the 
hamlet, aro u nd the hamlet. And I suspect 
that there was probab
ly a good French 
choice in that. I believe that
 they kicked us out of 
Marmande
 to put us in an area 
where collectively we were separated, but 
we were separated from the city, but we 
were easy picking fo r wh
en they wanted to -- 
Q: So it was the French that 
determined wh ere you mo ved? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: The French. The French
 police, the French city
 hall. A -- they made -- 
Q: Ordered you to go to  this next -- 

A: -- y -- oh yeah, yeah, and they -- and -- 
okay. Now, I forgot one incident in 
Marm ande 
which is very important in my  life, and 
I have to go back to just this one 
point. I remember my father conduc
ting the high holiday
 services in 
Marm ande
. 
Q: So th is is fall of 1940? 

A: Yes. And I rememb er my father also blowing the 
Shofar 
during the service, and I 
remember the room, th-the -- the -- the -- 
some parts of the ceremony, you know, 
that I remember. He, of course, was a very 
religious Jew, and a very intelligent man. 
Anyway, so he conducted the service. Well,
 as God would have 
it, when we were

reunited with my mother in 
Novemb er 1944, the city of
 Marm ande
 allocated to her 
that apartment, and we lived 
in that apartmen t in -- it was 
i-i-in -- that building was a 
historic building, it is a historic buildi
ng and street. It is a magnificent building, 
which comes from the Middle Ages, right, and it stands t-today, and it -- it™s 
beautiful, it™s -- 

Q: What is the address? 

A: The address is on a little street that I ca
nnot remember the name of, but it is -- I 
mean, it™s probably, I think probably 
the only really historical street of
 Marmande
, 
right, and I™m sure those buildings were 
available because they were historical 
document to the city -- I mean, buildings 
to the city. And we lived again on the 
second story, seemed to live in second stor
y. And we were give
n that building. And 
that build ing, I don™t know that it had elec
tricity, and it had dark 
staircases andentry 
hall. The building was made up of mud an
d wood, you know, an-and -- and wheat -- 
I mean, and -- and a -- you know, the remains 
of -- of -- of wheat. I-In other words, 
this was the construction. But it™s beau
tiful, you know, it™s very authentic, you 
know, and -- and there are other buildings lik
e that down this little narrow street of 
Oakland
, which they preser
ved, you know --

, I am not talking about
 
Oakland

member we living in 
that apartment after. B u t anyw
ay -- so, before we go to 
Sa int-Pa rdoux -du-Breuil
, 
this is what I remember, my
 father conducting the religi
ous services, and I probably 
-- it would be a guess, but I would bet you th
at everybody there is
 dead, that died, 
arrested by the French police,turned over to the Nazis all 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich  
raises the other question, the questi
on which is, you know, how can God have 
abandoned all his people? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: If we were in fact the chosen people, this
 is what we were chosen for? So there is 
legitimate religious dialog 
which is another of the 
[indecipherable]
 in my  history. 
My -- law is on one s -- hand, family and 
love and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and 

the sense of obligation and co mmi tment a
nd protection to the children, of your 

children, to preserve them. And now come
s this other question of, you know, where 
is God in all of this? Where is God we™re 
in the trenches, right? Wh ere is God, you 
know? What have we done, God, to de
serve this ultimate punishment? We are 
damn ed, condemn ed , hated, despised, youknow, abandoned in every sense of the 

word . We have no rights, we have no prop
erty, everything is taken from us. God, 
why? You chose us acco
rding to our religion to be th
e chosen people. Did you also 

 
Interv iew with Al

55
choose us to be this ultima
te suffer -- and if we have 
been chosen, right, for that, 
then my story is the testamen
t that I want to leave to my
 children, grandchildren an-
and generations forever, because if there is 
a truth here, then there is an equal truth 
here. But if there is a lie he
re, then there is another one,
 right? In other words, if 
there is no God, if there is no religion, 
obviously then there™
s no commitment, there 
is no covenant, there is no oblig ation, right,
 and religion is a farc
e. But if there is, 
why did this happen to us, you know? An
d so this is a dialog, a philosophical 
question wh ich has to be pose
d, right, and maybe it has no answer, and th at™s okay. 
Nor is there proof that there 
is a God. But the point is, a
ll of these things intersect, 
intellectually, morally, relig
iously, philoso phically, in 
my life. And then what 
happens? Okay, anyway, we en
d up in this village of 
Sa int-Pa r do ux
. It™s not a 
village, it™s a hamlet. The people there 
are magnificent people. We are given a 
habitat and that habitat, and I will call it th
at, is a mud floor, it is
 a chicken coop and 
on th e other side there™s the -- the cows, a
nd -- and that™s there whatever it is, I™ve 
forgotten now. Okay, and we
 live in this chicken co
op, two rooms, mud, no 
electricity, of course. And it had the little 
well and the little area for a garden that 
later my father creates. And th
is was given to us by the 
Marshal Feron
. The 
Marshal Feron
 lived across the street, 
this is his property, th
e -- the property is of 
his mother across the street, but the cows are hers, right. And this

very religious Catholics. They give us th

 was the same  plac e 
they gave to people who escaped 
Spain
 in the Spanish war. And people -- those 
people fled from there to 
Saint-Pardoux-d u-Breuil
. Why, I don™t know. They 
occupied the same place and 
they left later on back to 
Spain.
 Well now comes, right, 
this part of history, right, which is connecte

right, to the -- this, 
and now they™re refugees again. And so th
ese people again, with their good hearts 
and their good attitude and their good intent

 and they help. N -- 
this is part of the 
Berny, B-e-r-n-y
 family, and these people, the little street up to -- 
little bit of a hill from where 
we lived to where 
they -- their homes and his -- his -- 
his shop where he makes the met al horses a

the -- the shoe for

this wonderful guy. And up the street is 
the school. And in  -- the two room school, 
and I go to school. And I -- my first el

Marm ande
 for a short time. I started school in

but anyway -- but I™m in the school. And I 
rememb er raising my  hand in  the class to 
go to  the bathroom. I needed to go to the 
bathroom and the teacher didn™t see me, so 
I pissed in my pants, okay. I ri -- and ma
ybe she didn™t understand because I didn™t 
understand, but I rememb er raising my  hand,
 and I remember that. I also remember 
that we were learning a French poem,
 with -- a very famous poem from 
La 
Fountain,
 I think or -- about the hare and the 
rabbit, and I rememb
er that in that 
class. That™s all I remember in that class.
 But anyway, then we go back to my story 
in the hamlet, in -- in that par -- 
Saint-Pardoux-du-Breu il
. Okay, now, this is a 
very, very, very interesting and tr
aumatic episode in my life. The 
Berny
 family 
owned a lot, an empty lot across from the 
schoolhouse. And they  gave my  father the 

task, the job to raise a garden
 for them in this lot. And 
I remember g o ing up to him 
and bringing him lunch, and I rememb er 
him kissing me. He was all sweaty and had 
beard and all of that. Oh, that re -- that 
reminds me. I remember
 also the city of 
Marm ande
 had given us a garden . A place wher
e we co -- where each family  could 
have its own little garden and cultivate thei
r own vegetable. I remember that now. 
So maybe we were in 
Marm ande
 maybe a little bit longer, you know. But anyway , 
I remember that and there is a connect to 
that one. Gee, I didn™t remember that in 
awhile. Okay, anyway, he was there. Ok
ay, now I went to that school, and I 
reme mb er learning to  count with sticks, and 
so we had sticks, packs of 10, right, and 

 
Interv iew with Al

59
we had a rubber band around them an-and th
at -- we learned to count there. Okay, I 
remember that, but I also re
memb er so meth in g  else th at 
was not so nice. I rememb er 
the other boys -- other boys, 
they grabbed me and they  tie
d me or something to the 
fence and they said that I was the Christ k
iller and that they want
ed to punish me or 
whatever it is, and -- I told this story also 
to this French historian and she reported it 
in her book, and I am sure this happened
. That™s why she reported it in her book. 
That in th is environment of 
Sa int-P a rdoux -du-Breuil
, you have th is play of 
attitudes of people. Here is this family 
being helped and sheltered, allowed to 
survive, when nobody was allowed to give 
work to the refugee Jews, and yet they 
did. And at the same time, the children of ot
hers of the age of six and seven, equal to 
me, target me as a Christ k
iller. And obviously they didn™
t come up on this on their 
own. Obviously this was taught to them
. Obviously th is underlines what was 
happening and the crimes of the Catholic
 church are now descended on me. And 
they descend on my father,because what follows, right, 
is a choice made by French 
police, and French government and French  
-- and I have that whole testimony laying 
around that I will tell, about 
one of the men who had the 
power and didn™t exercise it 
to save my  father™s life, but who confessed 
to me that if he ha
d known that the chief 
of police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend 
Guyaux
, right? 
Gera rd 
Guyaux
, a man of extremely great kindness and 
character. This man, at -- one of the

times I went back to 
France
, and this time to reward hi
m for what he did for my 
mother, my father™s memory and for us. I ga
ve him a plaque as I gave to others. And 
this man said to me -- adm
itted something to me, and he
 says, there™s nothing they 
can do to me any more, I™m too old, but I co
uld have saved your fa
ther™s life. And if 
you blew a bomb right there in front of
 me, I -- I don™t think -- among the many, 
many shocks that I™ve had in life, this wa
s one. And he -- and he explained to me 
why. He said to me, when they  ordered the 
arrest of your father, and I participated in 
the arrest -- cause he was the 
chief officer of the city of 
Marm ande
, and 
Sa int-
Pard oux
 is within the -- th
e -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the
 
sphere -- the 
space -- the jurisdictional surrounding of 
Marmande
, under its jurisdiction. He said, 
I could have saved him, but I didn™t know th
at the police, the chief of police, was of 
the same mind as I, that we didn™t want this
 killing of innocent Jews. We didn™t want 
to make the choice betw een refugee Jews and French -born Jews. Bu t I didn™t know 

that, and he didn™t know I could trust him,
 and I didn™t know I could trust him. And 
so when your father was ordered to be a
rrested in March 1942
, he was arrested, 
obviously, with the consent and 
the cooperation of the city of 
Kiel,
 and the police of 
Kiel
 and of him.

A: I mean of -- of -- of 
Marmande
. I am su re that the things that he did for my 
mother after the war and for my brother and 
I was to repent and to atone for what he 
had done. I™m telling you, my
 father™s name stands on the war memorial of -- of 
Marm ande
. My father™s name also is in
 another memorial farther in 
France
, I don™t 
know where 
[indecipherable]
, course he is in there an
d the memorial to the Jews 
that were deported from 
France,
 which is in 
Paris, 
that they have built in recent 
years. But the one in 
Marm ande
 is the one that means something. He became the 
major of the city of 
Marmande. 
He became the representative from that region to 
the assem -- French assembly. He was 
a -- a man of tremendous personality and 
character, and again, a very religious man,
 a very French man. And again, they -- 
this interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what
 they feel, what they
 do, and what they -- 
and who they are, all right? It -- it play
s into th is whole -- you know? And wh at 
follows again is this conflict, between othe
rs who are obeying or
ders, others who are 
willingly passive, others w
ho are willingly complicit and 
others who are morally -- 
a-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel
 impotent to do anything. And so all of 
these people, I me et all of them. So, wh en I™m in school I™m treated well by the 
teacher and a -- you know, I™m allowed in sc
hool, and I™m just a normal kid. But the 
kids in the playground, I™m not the norma
l kid, I™m a Jew, dirty Jew, right? The 
Berny 
family, one of their son is the guy who 
is the vicar to the church. The church

is -- in this hamlet there is a very pr
ominen t church , a very beautiful church  
[indecipherable]
 in the 
Marshal Feron
, right, and the rest of
 it are farms, and this 
is a very, you know, beautiful, other th
an the school. Anyway , I rememb er many 
things. And one time I went back  and the so n of 
Berny
, right, who had quit the 
monastery, you know, when  I met him, I 
did -- you know, when  the -- you know. So  
he didn™t become a full fledged priest or
 monk, or you know. He chose not to. So 
when  we revisited one time, my  wife and 
I, the first time we went there, I took my  
children, and I couldn™t enter the building, 
that chicken coop, it 
was locked and there 
was nobody around, y
ou know. Bu t another time we came
 back and they were there, 
the 
Bernys.
 And so they  -- he took me around
. And he said to me, you were an 
extraordin ary child. He says, you learned the 
pato is
, which is the local French. You 
learned it in no time at all, you could spea
k it as well as anybody. And he says, you 
used to sit on my  lap and I would read yo
u stories, you know. He says, I was amazed 
that you could speak French, 
you know, you could speak the 
pa to is
, and obviously  I 
understood my  parents who 
spoke German. And th ey we
re learning, you know, 
French too. And so, I guess 
he really liked me, and well,
 a lot of people, you know, 
a-as a child that I was liked. But above 
all, my brother was liked mo re. You know, 
he was a very loving and th e second ch ild in
 family, or the second boy in  the family, 
they™re always innocent, they
™re always sweet, right? And so  he was. Now, for some

reason my mother, to help us
 in our survival, got a se
wing machine and she started 
to sew. And because of the 
hard work of my father, you
 know, toiling in -- in other 
people™s 
jardin -- 
gardens, my mother started to 
do seamstre ss work. And because 
of that she was able to su
rvive, through that skill. Now, the life for us in -- in 
Saint-
Pardoux-du-Breuil
 is a very interesting -- it™s very  pastoral, it™s very country , it™s a 
little hamlet. Everything -- you walk. If ther
e is any transportation it is by either 
camp -- two cows pulling a wagon, or on
e horse pulling a wagon. I remember many 
men  man y  times -- my  mo th er wou l d  send  me 
to this farm to buy some milk or to 
send me someplace to get brea
d and you had to go there,
 walk there. And once in 
awhile, you know, people would give me
 rides, you know, on these wagon. I 
remember everybody was so 
nice, they would give y
ou a ride, you know. And I 
remember walking on this little
 street and they grew 
watercress, and that was 
wonderful. I remember. But an
yway -- and my father cul
tivated a garden and -- in 
our -- in our -- in the side 
yard. And I rememb er that he used human excrement as 
part of the fertilizer, and we were togethe

-- I remember my father getting mad at 
me  and yelling at me

protecting me and I was runni

 Marm ande, 
Saint-Pardoux-du -Breuil

But that™s the last

I believe we went to a summer camp in the

The

A,
 and you were talking

A: Right. Now, we™re in this camp with 
Jewish children, run by Jewish adult leaders 
and -- and everything is wonde

concerned. It™s play, it™s hiking, it™s -- it™s

 us to stay with them. A

absolute connect. This is the fi
rst time I™d ever left my pa
rents, ever, and they -- they 
send me on the summe r camp with other child
ren, to play and ha
ve fun. That™s -- 
okay? Other children were there to play an
d to f -- have fun, too. Bu t that they 
should go home to their parent
, and I -- they want us to 
stay? That is a moment of 
absolute terror. Total incomp
rehension. Th-There is nothing that can describe it, 
nothing that can describe my  feeling at th
at moment. I am paralyzed, I am horrified, 
I am scared, I cannot co mp rehend. This is one mo ment in my  life where nothing 
makes any sense. And believe me, that ha
s impacted my life forever. That moment. 
That revelation. And of course I had no understanding wh at, why, but the total 
incomp rehension. I me an how co uld my  
parents, you understand, make this 
judgment? They  -- it™s impossible. Anyway , I reme mb er being there, and from that 

mo ment, for the next two and a half year
s, I became the guard ian of my  brother. 

And I became obsessed that he should ne
ver be separated from me for a moment, 
because I was afraid of what was going to 
happen. If he was sepa
rated they may take 
him away from me, an -and no way. So, I succ
eeded in mo st terms, but there was a 
period of time when he was housed somepl
ace and I was housed 
in another one, but 
that became an obsession with me, that 
I would go into frea
ky periods if they 
suggested anything that I should be separated from my  brother, or my  brother should 

be separated from me. So these other child
ren went home, and a 
few children stayed.

And we stayed with these, 
some o f the Jewish -- for l
ack of another term, I mean 
they were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this camp. 
Now, they th en proceeded on a plan, and th e 
plan I can only describe is a plan of 
survival of our people. They
 put us through the ritual 
of every holiday, we had to 
observe th em absolutely. We had to
 put handkerchiefs on our wrist on 
Shabba s, 
we 
had to observe every 
holiday religiously. I rememberth e last one we observed was
 
Sukko th
. I -- i-i-in that place in -- in -- in 
-- one of them had drawn a map of -- of 
Israel -- Palestine
 on -- on a -- a thing with a light bulb behind it, and th is was in 

blue, th-the -- the whole region. I remember
 that very well. I remember games being 
played, you know, th en they 
would toss us in -- in blankets, you understand, I mean, 
we were little kids. 

Q: How many ch ildren were with you? 

A: I don™t remember, b u t there were very few. 

Q: Very few? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And you™re still in the camp -- 

A: It™s not a camp in the sense -- I -- it™
s fenced. It™s on a little, you know, a little 
country house -- 

Q: Really?

A: -- you know, it™s a country house. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Okay, and I have pictures after the fact, a few.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But in this camp I have 
the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of 

impending doom. That they were teaching 
us only about Judaism, only about our 
religion, only about the Promised Land, on
ly about the -- I re
member that. And I 
have the absolute conviction that these peop
le were trying to preserve our religion 
and our people in th -- whatev
er means they had, and that 
-- in the hope that some of 
us would surviv e. Now, I reme mber severa
l incidents, but let me tell you one. And 
this incident is recalled  by another child, 
not necessarily in th
e same place, but the 
same event happened  to  him. And of cour
se I don™t know him, and I didn't know, 
but in the French book that was written by th
is French historian of the Jews, what 

happened, the Jews in the 
Lot-et-Garonne
 of 
France
 that she researched, among 
the many people she interviewed, she interv
iewed another survivor who told  her the 
very same story. And I don™t know him, he
 doesn™t know me. But the story basically 
is this. I remember th at those people ch
ange our names. And so my  name was 
changed from 
Lakritz
 to 
LaCroix.
 
LaCroix
 means the cross. It
™s a very French 
name. And one day th ey told me, and th e 
other children too, we™re going to have

these people visiting and th ey™re going to  
ask you some questions, and when  they 
do, when  they ask for your name, make su
re, don™t forg et, give them your new name 
of 
La Cro i x
. So now I am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are 
people coming to in terrogate us. And so  
sure enough these people came. I remember 
a woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I rememb er the wo man, she 
talked to me. And I told  this story to th
e French historian, among many stories that I 
told her -- not many, but anyway -- and sh
e reported that story in her book, right. 
And she gives credit to someone else telli
ng her the same story, some guy who now 

lives in -- in 
Sa n Diego
, and who also had the same  
kind of -- the same people. 
Well, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Qu aker, wh ere 
they tried to save so
me of the children from 
France
 and to ship them to
 England 
or
 
America
, and I remember that afterwards, you 
understand, we understood that these 
people were there to try to save us an-and 
sh ip us by -- by ship
, but th at became too 
dangerous and we could not leave. But I al
so remember that by that time I was a bed 
wetter and boys, other boys we
re making fun of me and they were trying to get me 
to stop and -- and the way they
 hope was they wouldn™t allow me to change my  bed, 
and so ev ery night I had to sleep in a bed th at was full of, to put it in plain

 I didn™t know, is that I was so 
traumatized , I was so terrorized, I was in su
ch pain, right, that that™s how it is. And 
obviously no child should be
 treated this way. But of course it was n o t their doing, 
obviously th ey were saving 
us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive an d -- 
and continue our people. To that extent, 
they succeeded. These 
were heroes. I owe 
them everything. Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me 
also, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my  lif

been if it wasn™t for my parents, and if
 it wasn™t for them and if it wasn™t for 
Christians that

behaved at the risk of their lives and th eir

no speech, this is a

saw a few years ago a movie called, ﬁ
The Ch ildren of Chabanne

 Chabanne

 and then later were in the

to smuggle us into 
Switze rland

and that™s located near the border with

ildren that we would be saved in th at

Q: Now how of -- y-you o

all -- to all these places?

 okay, it™s a

written to the director of the camp, and on

written in German.

many of them, will have to be translated. I have not had them 
translated, but they basically de
scribe, in this letter to Mr. 
Kohn
 about us, my  
brother and I, about my  uncle in 
Oakland
. My father sends this camp director 50 
francs for our care. Obviously he asks them to
 save us. I don™t know if he says why, 
I don™t know wh at he says, cause I don™t 
know, it™s all German. But I know what I 
didn™t know, and I know now what I didn™t 
know 10 years ago. 
And what I know is 
the following; that the French
 government on orders of 
Vichy
 had established under 
French law, certain conditi
ons for arrest of Jews. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: With a preference of arrest of refugee Jews. And th ey made various choices, 

some totally idiotic, you know
, doesn™t make any sense, but -- so some people were 
allowed to keep children, a
nd others were -- the children 
were to be arrested with 
their parents and sent to this camp in 
Ca sa nuri.
 
Ca sa nuri
 was in the department of 
Lot-et-Garonne
. And shortly after my father and 
mother sent these letters to the 
camp director and to my uncle, great-uncle in 
Oakland
, they were arrested by the 
French police, the both of them
 were put in this camp at 
Casanuri
. And among the 
idiosyncrasies of the French
, one of the exceptions th
at they made for th-the

incarcerated Jews was that if a w o man was 
pregnant, they would release the couple. 
So my  mo th er, in her usual good sense and 
courag e, told them she was pregnant. So 
she was examined by the doct
or and th e nurses and the docto r and nurses said she 
was pregnant. The book resear
ched by this wond
erful Christian writer of the history 
of the Jews -- and I came at the tail end 
of her research. I cam
e just before the 
publication. So obviously sh e didn't record this from my
 say-so. Sh e had recorded 
all of this. Her name is 
Marie-Juliette Vielcazat Petitcol. 
Her book is, 
Terre de -- 
d™Exile, Terre d™Asile.
 It was pe -- published in 20
06 and she -- she was telling me 
she was finishing and th e books was going 
to get printed. Among the many things 
that she had discovered, well before me, wa
s where my parents were incarcerated in 
a ca -- I didn™t know wh ere they were. And 
wh en I told  her I don™t know wh ere they 
were, she said, but I know. And I said, this
 is what I know happened in the camp , 
cause my mother told me. Y
ou know, she feigned to be 
pregnant and that th-the 
doctor of the camp and the nurse said the 
-- they confirmed that
, even though she 
wasn™t. And as a result, my parents were 
allo wed out of the camp. I™m going to tell 
you a historical fact, that if we had been with  my  parents in 
Ca sa nuri
 at the time 
they were arrested, we would all be dead
, because the French categorization of who 
is going to be shipped in to 
Drancy
 and then to -- to 
Auschwitz

1942, and then th-the enormous amount of
 Jews who were, and were shipped, th-

they were all wiped out. They were all 
killed in the concentration camp. The only 
thing that saved us was these two events. 
The fact that my parents, right, decided 
that we should not come home, and th at st
rangers had a better chance to save us than 
they did, cause they were helpless. And then comes this ot
her story, that my mother, 
you know, tells this story to
 the doctor, and the doctor says, yes, you are pregnant, 
confirmed that. And this fine human being 
with these fine nurses -- they are named 
in here, in this book. And you 
know, if I said it privately to
 you before the start, or I 
said it otherwise, I think I have come to 
a time where almost every important event 
in the history of the persecution of my  fa
mily, and I™m talking 
about my immediate 
family, that I have gotten the evidence. An
d you will hear, as we
 go along that that 
history goes to today. That 
there is a memorial now in 
Kiel,
 
Germany
, where there 
was no memo rial, only because of me. Because when  I visited 
Germany
, I asked 
them, you know, I -- the only memo rial that 
you have that remain
s, of the presence, 
and the persecution of Jews in 
Kiel
 is a little marker on the si
de of the curb of the 
street where the synagogue was 
burned, the main
 synagogue of 
Kiel
. Other than that 
they had no memo rial to the 
Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the -- 
the whole Holocaust, nothing. So
 when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it. I 
will pay, you know, if you make a memorial
. And what that memorial should consist 
of -- I understood th e environment -- I sa
id, it is a plaque like you did for the

want you to know that the 
governor of the state wrote to me in 20

such a memorial and a living tree. And two 
of my cousins were invited to come to 
the inauguration, and the one who 
is the vice president of the 
Weizmann
 Institute, 
the son of the

surv ivor, is the one who spoke

in the -- in the stories that were published,
 again it™s of my family, right, and all of it

 -- the photos of the ceremony, of the 
monument on th e back of -- of the -- one

reasons we were invited to

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Alfred Lakritz
. This is tape number three, side 
B. 
When  you were ch -- those two and a ha
 -- two years, two and a half years you 
were with your brother, alone
 with him, did you talk about your parents a lot? You 
said you had no communication in the 
beginning even , from your parents. 
A: Okay, there are many things I remember ab
out that period. It™s difficult for me to 
recall any particular conversation I had with  
my  brother. It is not difficult for me to 
recall a number of events that I rememb
er v ery specifically. The one thing I 
expressed earlier, and I say it again because 
it helps to explain; I had an obsession 
and fear, absolute fear, that I would be 
separated from my brot
her and he from me. I 
mean, this was an ab
solute fear. And obviously thatfear is clearly  tempered and 
explained by the fact that we were s
uddenly separated from 
our parents, right, 
without any comp rehension or explanation 
by anybody. So no
w what happens in 
this episode to my  brother and I fo r two 
and a half years is that we are in the 
comp any of other Jewish children, so they
 are contemporaries. Some  are older, right, 
many years older, cause we™re very little, and 
some of them are 
about our age, and 
we play and -- and -- and do things like littl
e children. One of th
e frightful memories 
that I remember is my wife and I went for 
two weeks to a place in
 -- in the south -- I 
mean in the west -- I m
ean the east part of 
France
 call -- a city called 
Anisy .
 We

went there to attend a French school provi
ded to foreigners and we thought that 
would be really fun for her and I to go to
 French school, and she would learn a little 
French. In the meantime we 
have tw o weeks of vacation. And during that two week 
period, one day -- I mean, every weekend I 
would take her and we
 would go around. 
And one of the points that I tried to find, I 
tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in 
the upper plateau of a big city called 
Ev ia n
, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake

 went to her place, and she showed  us

didn™t want to stay there. But as we 
walked out, there was a queue -- a line of 
little children going to

I guess they were going to bed. I guess that

those mo ments where you™re taken back  to this me mo ry. Anyway , these were times 
where we had the company of other childre

boat as we were, and we knew we were in
 danger. We knew that 
we weren™t allowed 
to go out and play, we were not allowed 
to do anything in the exterior, everything 
was done in the interior. In the 
Ault Sevoir 
we did so mething on the exterior, there

 okay, I cry, I scream, I -- God kno
ws what I did. Anyway, but they 
assure me that I will see him and I will be 
with him and that I shouldn™t worry, that 
he is going to be fine and I™m going to be
 fine, but they have to separate us. And I 

am certain that they separated us becau
se there was a danger, because our French 
maybe wasn™t perfect, and he was younger, 
and he was innocen t and he could speak 
up and give his real
 name and identity and then be disc
overed, then we 
both die. So I 
think they separated us there. In other pl
ace before that we were all with Jewish 
children, so it didn™t matter. But there it ma
tter, because we were hidden with  all of 
these orphan Christian children, by the thousands, you understand. And I™m sure that 
it was an act of preservation, to protect us. 
So they put him in th
is place and they put 
me in the convent, an d I was in the convent on the grounds of the 
Basilica

 invalid visitors to the city of

 and 
they come there and these nuns are nurses 
and they nurse these people during th eir

travel, right, nobody can move, and now th ey
 have nothing to do and these children 
are being brought in, you know, by
 the government. Rounded up from 
France
 and -- 
and brought into the city 
cause it™s -- they™ve got the 
road, they go
t the hotels 
unoccupied. The state takes over all of those 
hotels, and they offered, obviously, to 
shelter some children. Incidentally , I want
 to go back to tell you one part of the 
story. Among -- and I haven™t -- I haven™t co

happened to my mother and fa

 said, is that my parents 
were totally, completely trapped. They ha
d no means, no right, no power to move. 
They  had no papers, and police, French
 police would stop people, you know, for 
identification and you know, 
identity card, you know, with photograph. I mean, 
there™s no way you could move. So my  mo th er
 one time told me ab

to go somewhere, all right, ev

What it was, I don™t know. And so  she descri

A: -- the ditch next to the road to  hide. An
d that™s how they travel, right, to wherever 
they were going, I don™t know where, but 
anyway, the point that
 I™m making is that 
when they were shipped from
 Ma rma nd e
, they were not allo
wed to live there any 
more, and we were in this little hamlet. I sa
id earlier that in my 
understanding of it, 
they were put there for easy picking, all 
right, by th e French police. And the whole 
system was geared around k
eeping them there, locked in
, with no escape and no 
means of escape. So now you can understa
nd this couple, right. 
No w th ey  say ,  oh  
my  God, we have sent our ch ildren away an
d they™re going to come arrest us. N o w, 
okay, then  comes the second judgment, well 
better they stay there in the protection 
of this organization then , cause we are tra
pped. We cannot escape, right. So they are 
like animals in the cage and the French are inhospitable.
 The police is absolutely 
their enemy, right, and hunt -- their hunter, ri
ght, and they know it. They ™re going to  
be arrested at the whim of -- of the poli
ce. They have no powe
r whatsoever. So the 
total abandonment, you know, of
 these people, the total fact
 that they™re totally left 
with no escape -- 

Q: Mm-hm.

to them. Okay, now ba

that are very life long. I remember on the 
ground of the basilica by myself, I w ould 
go and visit the grotto. I was alone and I re
member praying there.
 What I prayed for 
was for my parents. So the question you as
ked me about my  parents, there I know. I 
know what I prayed for. That™s what I pray
ed for. And so I never lost hope. I never 
give up, no. There I went to pray , and 
not once, but quite a few times. And today 
when I revisited 
Lourdes
 in the year 2000, of course there are hundreds, thousands 
of people with candles an-and the whole pa
raphernalia. But here™s a grotto, I was the 
only occu pant. It was just me. 
Q: So you were there -- 
you said you were the onl

A: Ye -- I was -- I was -- no. There were -- 
there were other children sheltered in the

A: But I don™t rememb er. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Okay. Okay, I don™t
 remember that. I do remember th
at this convent had a priest 
and he was a young priest. 
And I rememb er one day walk ing with him, the grounds 
of this long basilica, this long walkway, and 
I told him that I resented that I had to 
go to  -- to church  every Su nday  mo rning and that I was not allowed to kneel. 
Q: Did he know you were Jewish?  

A: Oh yeah, oh. No  question. And he said 
to me in retort, and I remember it, n ever, 
never, never will forget. He was the nicest
 guy, he really love

well at least I don™t make you go to catechis

time, singing songs, you know, I remember that.  
Q: What was the contact with your brother?

with him from time to
 time. And one day 
the liberation, and I was -- before the 
liberation came, and so me woman -- the 
French had organized some kind of 
system to ask local habitants of 
Lo urdes

provide a home for these orphan children, you know, to give them a little bit of a 
family, a little bit of that type of expe
rience. So a wo man volunteered to have me,

of the Almighty, maybe, it turned out she 
was a Jewish French  woman, and I was to be her little boy. So she treated me, 
obviously with tremendous love. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Okay. And I said that -- that I would 
not continue to co me unless my  brother 
came. 

Q: Oh. 
A: And she didn™t want to, but she agreed

I remember when I was leaving her, and sh

this child, a child, and that child had ne

the same. Oh no, no, no, I promise, I 
promise, I won™t forget you. I will write to

one of my  many regrets, you know. This
 was a wonderful, wonderful wo man. 

Q: What was her name? 
A: Ah, God knows, I don™t, you know. 
But again, you know, maybe children are 
more blessed and maybe they are protecte

-- and newspaper men 
and they considered that to be what I c
onsider it, th -- not fully appreciating the 
content. Anyway , so shortly after that, by 
th is Jewish organization we were taken 
and reunited with my mother. And I re

the same spot that I 
last saw her, say two and a half years 
before, with her close friend that she 
developed, this Madame
 Rozinsky
, and her son, who became
 my  close friend. And 
they were Jews of -- from
 Alsace-Lorraine
 and they were spared
. They were spared 
in the town of ma --
 Marmande
, and two doors down  was another Jewish family by 
the name of 
Alco
, all of these were our friends af
ter the war, and they were spared 
because they were 
French born. So in
 France
 that™s another thing that happened.

There was a very, very, very
, you know, factual differenc

was not allowed to survive. An
d we, the refugees Jews in 
France 
were the ones that 
were handed for slaughter. Knowingly, ob
ligingly by the French. And th e other one, 
they spared.  
Q: Tell me what it was like

A: Well, it was a shock, beca
use she had gained weight a

but it was my mother, and that I recogn

A: Well, she had gotten this apartment. Sh

the 
Secretaire Generale

administered that apartm
ent that I referred to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- where my father had pe

there. And I remember being in that
 apartmen t when the liberation of 
Paris
 came, 
and I remember making little flags of 
America
 and so  for -- and 
Brita in

France, 
you know, and I hung them on the window, and I rememb er that. You

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And so was I. And so after we stayed
 there a -- you know a short time, you know, 
in that apartment, then we were 
given the apartment I said on the 
Boulevard de 
Marie
, opposite the warehouse and th ere we 
lived. And my  brother and I went to 
school, and he became a closest friend to a boy named 
Saresh Guyaux, 
who se 
father was 
Gerard Guyaux
, that man -- they lived just
 down the street, the sid e 
street. And he helped  us 
to survive, you know. And 
my mother™s story is an 
important story. She was left with my father and they struggled, right, until -- 

together after they were 
released from the camp at 
Casanuri
. Then they liv
ed in that 
same mud chicken coop, as my  wife ca
lls it. And one day the police came, as 
expected, and they arrested my
 father. And his arrest is 
also recorded in the books 
that I have. I mean, I have every evidence 
of why he was arrest
ed on the orders of 
Eichmann
, for the -- as a r -- act of ret -- 
retribution against the killing of two 
German officer in 
Paris
. And 
Eichmann
 declared that there should be a punishment 
for this, 2000 Jews were to  be arrested throughout 
France
 and turned over to them 
at 
Drancy
, and the French complied. My father
 was one of those who was arrested 
and he was put in th e camp  of 
Gurs, G-u-r-s

Drancy

Auschwitz
 to

he was allowed one goodbye,
 farewell postcard, that he mailed to my mother. And 
this I have, and it™s dated March th e third,
 1943, and in stead -- instead of saying 
au

, or instead of saying something el

adieu
 
with an exclamation mark, underscored twic

for death. And he said 
that we should have 
bon courage, 
you know, strength to deal 
with it, and he sent us his love.

just what she endured, but how I look at 
how she endured. I c
onsider her about as 
great a woman, a mother as there can be, 
in fact, I call her an angel. After my 
father™s arrest in February, at the end of 
February, 1943, she is left alone. She has no 
idea if her children are alive or dead, except
 th-there are a few photographs that are 
given to her. And sh e, of course, knows no
thing of wh at happened  to  her husband. 
And so she is left there alone, right. And 
sh e speaks the language cause she picks up

the language fast. She™s a seamstress, sh
e is known by the farming families, you 
know, who use her. And one day she is aske
d by this Italian farmer™s family, the 
Ros 
family, 
R-o-s
 to make a wedding dress for th
eir one -- their second oldest 
daughter. So my mother makes th is weddi
ng dress for her, and she did, I guess, a 
reasonably good job. Then they  ask her 
to make the suit for 
the groom. So she 
makes that. And from then on they are to
tally connected,a
nd they  become her 
protectors. So, they  take her away , she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in 
tremendous pain and they give her a fami ly 
and a home and a place. So this is two 
people wh o had immigrated from
 Italy
 when things were
 bad in northern 
Italy
 in 
the early 30™s. And they  became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of 
France
 at a 
chateau called
 LeCook
, and -- by a woman who was
 
Mad a me
 deFerrier
, a noble 
lady of -- not noble in act, of course she 
was noble in act, but her name was of the 
nobility. And the tenant farmers th
at they have is this family, 
Ros.
 And this couple, 
the 
Ros™
 are two magnificent -- magnificent hum
an beings. They are farmers w ith a 
little education. They have six or seven 
children, right now I™m not counting them, 
and they  have this farm. And so th ey ta
ke her in and from time to time, you know, 
one of their son, you know transports my  
mother by bicycle to their farm, which is 
up on this hill, at the 
mas dejeuner
. And sh e is all alone so 
they adopt her and they 
hide her. Their oldest 
son is ordered into 
Germany
 as part of the -- the -- the -- the

German orders, it takes one child from certa
in families, you know
, to -- as laborers 
in 
Germany
, and he is one of them, and he™s not 
there. So I guess 
in the sense they 
consoled themselves b ecause they have so
me connect in that 
sense. Anyway, she 
spends a lot of time there, and they even
 hide her. One time I was taken through 
when I returned. When I was 
a child growing up th ere I wasn™t interested in any of 
this, but when I returned with 
my wife and -- and children to 
LeCook, LeCook 
had 
been sold to a German
 couple, but they we
re -- they allowed us
 to come and visit 
that site. A nd I was then taken through the ch
ateau, as I had been as a child, we used 
to play there all the time after the war. Bu t I was shown a room in this chateau that 
had a secret wall, and my mother was hidd
en in that wall. So
 when police came to 
LeCook
 to check what™s what, and 
so forth, so forth, they
 would hide her in this 
wall, you know, which was a fake wall. So, 
in my  family so many things happened 

that happened to other Jews in other plac
es and so on, even th
at happened. Anyway, 
these wonderful people kept her, nouris
hed her, gave her support, mo ral and 
physical in that sense and helped  her over 
this period. A photogra

my mother shows her extreme 
pain. And she is in one picture shown, that™s all I 
have, wh en she is with her sewing machine 
[indeciphera ble]
. Then the next picture 
I have of her is two and a half years la

pain in her eyes is so clear and her prid

 event, where she even made
 the clothes that we wear. 
And she is bringing her boys. And this fami

that is, when a person, right, is part of an

Gedanta
 volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of 
West Germany
 killed 
by th e Nazis as reported and record ed by 
the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in

don™t think I would have been 
more shocked, more surprised,
 more in a state of total 
emotional disconnect and co nnect, ya -- total. I opened the book, I go to

the first thing I read is the name of 
Mirel
 
Weber, geb Lakritz
, from 
Kiel
. That™s 
my  grandmother. So  I run down , the next name I find is
 Simon,
 initial 
S, Lakritz 
Weber. 
And they put his place of re
sidence and where he died, 
Majdanek, Lublin
, 
sometime in ™43. How in the world th
ey restored to him his name of 
Weber
 as a 
memorial to him is -- I -- 
I totally without any compre
hension. How they went 
through the records and restored to him hi
s name, is unbelievable. So the connection 
to my pursuit of my name
, my identity, my roots, he
re it is confirmed in the 
Gedanta 
book, handed to
 me in the 
Ya d Vashem
. And so I said -- and I looked then 
for the other relatives, the 
Weizm a nns, 
and they™re all record
ed, anyway , everybody 
in the 
Weizner
 is in, they are recorded. Aunts 
and uncles and cous

are recorded. Anyway, so now let 
me co me to  wh at h ap pen s in  
United States of 
America. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: We come to 
Oakland
, right, and we stay

M-Mike
 and my  
Aunt 
Eda

my  cousins, these are my  uncle and 
aunt. We are welcomed in 
New Yo rk
 by an  -- a niece, a cousin of mine, 
Friedel

Q: What was it like to st

America
 is the dream. I remember docking -- 
well, no, first I remember coming -- 
entering into the port of
 New York
. 
Q: What boat were you on? 
A: I don™t know. It was a port that left 
-- m-my mother arrange
d for us, before we 
left 
Europe
 that she wanted to see
 Paris
. She hadn™t seen -- we hadn™t been  there, 
and she wanted to go to  
Ro me. 
And so  she arranged to -- from a -- through a Jewish 
agency , right, that we could have these pe
riods. Remember, we didn™t have much of 
anything, everything was taken from us
. And we were not
 poor people in 
Germany
, 
but we didn™t own the -- th-the -- the -- the 
-- the retail store, you know. We owned a 
wholesale 
schmutter,
 okay. Well, we were good anyway, not rich. And here we are 

and so sh e™s getting help, you k
now, for us to immigrate to 
United States
. So we 
leave from 
Naples.
 What was it you asked me? 
Q: The name of the boat. That™s okay. 
A: Yeah, I -- I knew the name of the boat. 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: Anyway, it was an ordinary commercial b o at. 

Q: Yeah, I get it  
A: Okay .

 put your foot down on American soil.

A: Right. So I rememb er docking, but befo
re docking, we passed by the Statue of 
Liberty. And wh en we were in 
Paris, 
before we left, and we were sightseeing and so  
forth, we found the replica of the Statue
 of Liberty, you know, by the guy who -- 
who made th-the thing. So I saw it, and mm,
 look at that thing, huh? Yeah, it™s not 
so big. Anyway, but it was 
nice, an-and you know, and 
gave you that umph, you 
know, hope, you know. Next time I see you, I™
ll see your big sister. And there I was, 
I saw the big sister. You know, here was th
e promised land, you know. Here was my  
life, all right. A boy who had very little given to him by 
France
, right, and 
everything hoped for in the 
United States
. So  the Statue of Liberty was a mo ment I 
cried. When we docked, th
en we disemb arked and th
ere were people crowded 
around and whate -- and behind the fence,
 you know, and my  mo ther found her 
brother and her sister-in-law, wh o were ther
e. And of course I didn™t know th em, but 
of course I found out right 
away  who th ey were
. Anyway, so after we -- we cleared 
the -- everything else, I think I had to 
go to  the bathroom. And so somebody, you 
understand, it was 
Friedel™s
 husband, who was -- the husband is a -- was a taxi 
driver, I remember in -- in 
Brooklyn
. They lived in 
Brooklyn
. My  aunt and uncle 
had co me from 
Oakland
 across the 
United States
. I know those four people were 
there. And it mu st have been him, he took 
me to a bar to go to the toilet. And I saw a 
jukebox in this -- I had never seen a juke
box. I was amazed. This

I was totally amazed. The only thing I knew
 about music was th

know, so forth, you -- okay, so that 
was one thing. Then I saw them selling 
Frosties
, 
you know, that ice cream. 
So, he bought me one. I ta
sted it; it was so rich, so 
wonderful, so magnificent. In 
France
 the ice cream is so rt 
of watery and -- an-and 
icy, but here was -- it™s so rich. So they ha
d a boy, wha -- we stayed with them for a 
week, and this boy was a little fat, and we
 were thin. And I sa
w the amount of food 
that they had, of milk and butter and ch eese and -- and a 
[indecipherable]
 I said, no 
wonder he™s fat. 
Q: Did you speak English at that point? 

A: Not a wo rd. And I had done somethin
g in prep aration of coming here. I had 
written to the embassy in 
Paris,
 right, the French embassy
 -- I mean the American 
embassy and I™d say we™re going to immigrate, you know, an-and I wanted 

something cause in -- in
 Ma rma nd e
 there was nothing ab out learning English. 
There was no book in 
the library, there was nothing. I 
had French books, you know, 
yeah. And so they sent me a book, right, ni
ce they were, to learn about English. So 
on my own, you know, I learned a few word
s in the little thing, but on my own I 
couldn™t do anything, I couldn™t learn a
nything, I ma -- it was -- so that™s the 
beginning, right, so, wh ere -- with -- with

 me and fo und me, you know, cause 
he -- they knew I was a lawyer, and he™s a 
lawyer, so he said, I -- I can find him. He 
did that. Anyway -- 

Q: So how long 
did you stay in 
New Yo rk
? 
A: I think we stayed just a week. 

Q: Oh, then you went out -- 
A: And then  -- then my  mo ther wanted to
 cross the country, you know, and see the 
country, you know, and so for fi

Q: Train. 

A: On this train, again, 
you know, we meet all these 
wonderful people. And so we 
met this guy and he be
friended, you know, 
Herb

they bring us a menu and we™re looking

would send us a food parcel, you know, during the time that we were in

 after 
the -- you know, the war ended, they w
ould send us these wo
nderful packages, you 
know? 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And one of the things they had -- they
 shipped us, was corned beef. You know 
[indecipherable]
. So I saw the word co

the waiter, black guy, I

atever. And I pointed
 this word corn, 
okay? So I figure we™re -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- ordering corned beef.  
Q: Right. 
A: And that we knew we liked. So here 
comes the waiter with two plates and on 
each plate is an ear of corn. We look at this, what is this? This is a joke. In
 France
 
the only people who ate corn were pigs. 
Q: Oh.

Oakland
 he was visiting his family, it was acro

there, but my  mo ther wouldn™t allow our

Oakland.

worked there until she retir

worked there loved her, cause
 she was a -- a ma -- I mean, really, everybody loved

 you know. She didn™t
 parade her pain 
or her suffering, you know. She was just, I 
me -- I mean, a hundred
 percent good, in 
every sense. 
Q: So you went to hi

A: So we were in 
Oakland
, okay. So now my cousins,
 you know, who are very 
active and graduated,
 you know, from the 
Oakland
 schools, you know, th-they tried 
to enroll us, okay. And so 
they got us enrolled in 
Oakland
 Technical High School. 
And the high school is trying 
to  figure out wh at to do with us, cause we don™t speak 
English and there™s nobody there, no tu
to rs, nothing. The onl
y person who speaks 
French in the whole school is the French
 teacher. Obviously she wasn™t about to, 
you know, be our full time teach

Q: Mm. 
A: And that is for sure. 
Q: Mm. 

A: Within that time period I 
got a job working in the mark

grocery store, taking out groceries. We gra

my  high school. I was on th e board, of cour

I was on the swimming team. We we
re both admitted to University
 
of
 Ca lifornia 
at
 
Berkeley. 
We both graduated and then I went
 to law school at the University
 
of
 
California Berkeley, Bolt Hall
, which is about as -- as 
premier a law school as 
Harvard
, right. At the time they were 
the premier law schools in the 
United States
. 
My brother became a 
CPA
, he went to work for the 
IRS, 
then he got tired of that 
and he open ed his prac

Toyota
 agency that he bought from 
one of his clients many, many years ago. He 
has got three sons, one is a par -- pair of

 which is in

just a little w ays between

A: I -- I understand, I understand. Re

synagogue.  
Q: Right. 
A: My father was a very observant Jew. 
I mean he -- he -- he put on the Tefillin

France
 during the occupation 
when  we had nothing to eat. When th
ere was no meat, you understand and th e only 
available meat was pork, they gave it to 
my  brother and I, but not -- they wouldn™t 
eat it, okay. To the ex tent that she could -- my  mo ther could keep  kosher, you 

understand, in -- in this kind of horri

shame or resentment about being a Jew, right
. And th-that speaks to the -- to the -- to 
the attitude and feelings that you have. Now, 
was I glad to be a target and a -- and a -
- and a victim? No. I mean, obviously  that 
made me very angry. And wh en I came to 
understand how the proce

forth, no, I became very angry. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But -- and then I learned more and 
more, even about th
e complicity of the 
United 
States
 and I call it what it is because it is 
a complixa -- complicity 
in the murder of 
six million Jews, and I say it now, forever it 
should be remembered
 that they -- the 
Germans were complicit, the Fr
ench were complicit, so was 
America
. 
FDR
 was 
complicit. The State Department was comp
licit. And not -- they didn™t stop their 
complicity with this monstrou
s period of crime. They didn™t even  redeem it by honor 
us, you understand, to -- to allow us to immi grate the 
United Sta tes
 before the worst 
quota imposed. I can™t forgive 
that. I can™t forget that. This can never be forgotten,

know, oh -- and -- and the dysfunctional treatment of -- of millions of Mexicans and 

Latin Americans, of the Cubans and --

the country. We were allowed to go ther

 graduate. And he 
would have, if he wanted to, 
he would have gone the di 
-- post-graduate school, as I 
did. I went to 
Berkeley
, to 
Bolt Hall.
 We were treated totally
 equally, fairly, justly. 
So in every sense the 
United States
 gave to -- every opportunity  to us. We owe 
every bit of gratitude, you 
know, and thanks to the 
United States
. I mean, look, we 
came here with nothing, with
 hope. And th is beautiful land, this beau tiful country, 
right, gave us every opportuni
ty. But we had to earn it. 
And we lived through three 
years of high school without 
tutors, without aid, without 
assistance. We had to earn 
it. We earned it. And you know wh at, the re
st of the way also we earned, with out 
assistance, without help, right
. This is a sink or swim so
ciety. Well, we survived. 
Thank God. But it is only in this beautiful 
land, right, that gives opportunity  to so 
many people, and has, and does,
 you know. So I make a judg
ment on this country. I 
condemn fo r wh at happened  during th e war and the immediate post-war period, and 
I praise this country fo
r the period since then.

Beginn ing Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Alfred Lakritz
. This is tape number five, side
 
A.
 How did your experience of your childh
ood and your life affect the raising or 
your children? Or did it? 
A: It a -- and I would tell you in  truth two things. I was a very caring and -- and 

loving father. I am still, but 
I had my  faults. And part of 
my fault was that I grew up 
with a certain amount of insecurity and 
that insecurity stri
ved for security to 
counterbalance. And as I evolve there was a 
mixture as a person, both of striving fo r 
certain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with 

anger. Throughout my  life I think that the 
experience of my ch
ildhood has affected 
my personality in the sense that I am much
 more explosive or ex -- more explosive 
than I would have been  otherwise. I™m ea
sy to get upset and I am -- once I explode, 
which is -- doesn ™t happen often, cause I -- I 
contro l it, or it doesn™t give me rise to 
anger. Bu t when  I do explode, I explode. An
d so I was a father who was loving and 
caring an-and -- and -- and they  could depend
 on. Bu t if something went wrong or 
something was not right, they would hear 
about it plenty . And so in  that sense my  
children have a certain amount of resentme
nt to wh en I wasn™t as kind or as 
considerate or as sensitive or
 as -- you know, I -- as I s
hould have been. On th e other

hand, my children see -- at
 least my  daughter does, because her two sons, our 
grandsons live close to us and we see them 
often, once a week at least, and we take 
them on vacation and so forth, so on. 
Then  I™m probably one of their best 
grandfathers that there is. So as much as 
I, in my pursu it of s -- trying to strive for 
security for them, once I achie
ved that, I also was the grea
test -- oh -- th -- I -- what 
am I talking about with my  
[tape break]
. Hold on, let™s start over, cause I -- 
Q: No, you can keep
 talking. Oh -- 
A: All right. In any event, so the question 
you ask is did it affect me as I grew up 
and matured, and it definitely does. As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I 
can easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by 
somebody™s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am
 attacked in that way, I become very 
foraci -- ferocious, I beco
me like the bulldog who -- at 
your ankle. And I will have 
the last word. So, yes, in one sense, you und
erstand, I have this anger. One thing that 
has helped  me, truly, is many years ago I st
arted to write some of my history, some 
of my memories, and that became a -- lik
e a psychological ther
apy for me, in many 
ways. To recount for myself -- this is stri
ctly, you know, me, so
me of these events, 
some of these experiences, some o f those 
feelings, you know, that I have. And part 
of retelling and reminding my self and crying
 along the story, I think has helped  me 
to -- to reconcile myself w
ith the injustices that happe
ned to my family. And I will

say that I believe the reason I became a lawy
er was to spend my life, to ensure to 
whatever degree I had, in cap
ability of opportunity, to make
 sure that other people 
are treated fairly, according to deeds, not
 according to religion 
or not according to 
fate or chance. And after 47 years of -- as 
a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the 
state of 
California
, I think I have done that with 
honor and -- so the aftereffect of 
the experien ce of the war is I haven™t gone
 out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot 
the Nazis or the Germans. I have not taken 
retaliation against them
 or others. I have 
accepted the fate that we had, never to fo
rgive, never to forget. And that™s an 
absolute. And I remember having lunch with
 this nun who was the as -- who was the 
assistant of the Cardinal 
Mahoney
, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern 
California
, one of the preeminent Ca
rdinals in this country, and th ey  had selected 
me for their -- I was th e poster child 
for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the 
reunification, or the year redemp tion betw
een the Catholics and the Jews. And they 
had one ed ition that was devoted , and I was th
e centerfold story, in
 full color, in full 
everything. And a -- after it was done, she ca
me and visited me in my  office and we 

went to lunch togeth er, and I expressed some
 of this feeling of my  anger. My  anger 
at what Pope
 Pius 12
th
 
didn™t do. What the Catholic 
archdi -- hierarchy did not do. 
The choices they made, and other Ca
tholics eminence and nuns and -- and 
[indecipherable]
 you know. Sheltered and hid, sa
ved Jews and th e others did the

opposite. And I told  her about these, you 
know, these mi xed feelings. And she says -
- and I said never to forgive, never to fo
rget. Sh e said, of course you should never 
forget. Bu t she says, for your own soul, fo
r yourself, you should fo rgive. So I have 
to say that between my  own therapy in
 writing about it and talking about it and 
my self and -- and so forth, and the messag
e that she gave to me, somehow I matured 
and so I could bring my self to go back an
d accept the invitation of the state I was 
born, the city wh ere I was born, to visit. A
nd I did it. I was very curious to see where 
I was born, where I come from,
 y ou know, this part of my  trip, you know, to get my 
roots. And I got it and I was very happy. 
I had no resentment, on the contrary. The 
mayor was a perfect English sp eaking pers
on, who had married an English girl. All 
the people there spoke English perfectly. 

Q: Did you feel very Germ
an when you were there? 
A: No, not at all. No, no, no, 
no, I didn't  feel German at all. This was my birthplace, 
I am honored that I was born th ere, in a university town th at my  grandfather 
selected. It™s a beautiful town, I 
just went to my granddaughter™s 
Bat Mitzvah
, and 
among th e guests there is her -- h-her -- one
 of her uncles, and he work s for the 
Pentagon, you know, in a secret, secret job.
 And he s-said he didn't know wh ere I 
was born, and I told  him, you know, cause I 
showed him this book, th ey all wanted 
to see it. So he said, 
Kiel
, I was in 
Kiel
. You know, as part of the Pentagon, the -- he

visited, and he was th -- you know, 
toured ev erywhere and he was taken 
everywhere. He says -- he said to me, that
™s a beautiful city. I said yeah. And it™s a 
university city. I said yeah. You know, 
anyway, I am amazed that many other 
survivors of the Holocaust th
at I have met over this peri
od of my  life survive what 
happened to them, and 
instead of quitting, instead of cr
ying, instead of feeling sorry 
for themselves, they 
picked up, right, and said I™m 
going forward, I™m gonna live, I 
have to live. Right. They, you know, peri
shed, you know, not by ch oice but by the 
hands of criminals and monsters. You know,
 whether they were 
the complicit one or 
the active one, but I™m going to  live. And so
 I met a number of them, including one 
who surv ived 
Auschwitz
 in the -- in a -- th
at Nazi symbol that
 was carved on his 
forehead, and he became one 
of the early establisher in 
Australia
 of the -- the mini-
shopping malls. A very rich guy. And ma
ny others. They surv
iv ed . T h ey
 -- they 
somehow adjusted, you know, 
and they became husbands a
nd fathers and uncles and 

-- and grandfathers. I think I have the best 
of all relationship with my  grandsons. My 
children love me and so forth, but they re
me mb er times when  I was not too kind to 
them, right, when  I got angry.

want that, don™t marry me. Okay, cause she

but not observant Jews. So she comp lie

went through; for example, the fact that
 I w as not educated for many years, right? 
For some reason, whatever ha

necessary to be able to get grades to get into
 Berkeley.
 Okay, it came. And in 
Berkeley

discovery of real education, and I 
became in love with learning

experience, and yet I am. So 
I am in this balance, you

or I allow myself to, that I 
lose that equilibrium. But even
 if I do, once I express it, 
it™s out of me, right, that™s one of the thin gs, the attributes of my personality. That 
once I let out -- I have to let things out. I™m 
not an introvert, I™m an extrovert, and so 
once I let it out, it™s gone. I™m past whateve
r, you know, the mo ment is. So yes, I am 
susceptible to get att
acked or angry, and to become 
defensive, I think faster than 
mo st people. I react trigger-like, you unders
tand, to certain attack
s. More ferociously 
than most people, and most trial lawyers. I 
am not an easy adversary. If you attack --

fairness and justice that was handed to th

abuse of the law, right, who had ordered the arrest, the incarceration, the liquidation 
of six million Jews. He, right, 
who did all that, was accorded just the opposite. Every 
courtesy, ev ery legal rights, every right to
 defense, everything. So I am, on that 
sense, I felt justice was done. Just as much 
he denied justice to my father. But to him 
justice was done. So  I -- you know, I don™t

found him, they caught him, 
they tried him, they -- they

is part of the aftermath of the war to the city of 
Kiel
, and it shows, you know, a very 
-- I have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during th e winter in a very 
heavy snow, and you™ve got a bunch of pe
ople who are walking on foot in this 
desolate, terrible, abysmal area of the remain s of the city of 
Kiel
. Well, of course, 
the whole city was not destroyed by th
e British and the American bombers. The 
access to the port were -- the property of my 
grandfather it was. But he gave me that 
so that I would get the other side of the 
coin, to which I™m very
 sensitive. Well, we 
had dinner one night, he 
and I an-and my  cousin. I asked him, wh-w hy did you 
people invite us? And he says, because 
when we have done it in the past, the 
goodwill that happened paid 
for whatever happened on 
both sides. But when we 
went, the newspaper reported our visit and I 
-- again, I did not read the whole thing, 
but the Christian couple who 
were responsible for brin
ging attention to us and 
getting the city and the state to invite us a

could say is a hundred

 you know, anything that y

 are all part of -- of -- you know, thesis

Christian couple, right, begrudge the expenditu
re by th e city and th
e state for such a 
lavish state for us. So, you 
know, the Jewish people are 
very honored in the sense 
that we have survived by 
our own means and our own ab
ility to survive. Mentally, 
emotionally, economically, my fam
ily did not ask for money -- 
Q: Reparations? 
A: Reparation. 
France
 paid her some money. We received my inheritance of my 
grandparents, you know, I mean the property 
was evaluated 1950 or ™51. The seven 
of us all received the then appraised value 
of the land. That land is one of the mo st 
expensive, income producing land in the city of 
Kiel
. Today the stadium was being 
rebuilt, you know, on that land. Of course, 
other land too, because it™s very big and 
our property wasn™t that 
big. And it is a place in 
Kiel
, which is in the northern part 
of 
Germany
, it™s very cold. And all of the sports activity, conventions, or -- 
everything of income producing 
to the city occurs in that
 -- in that plaza. So we 
received an appraised value of
 1950, of raw land. Thirty
 years later, 40 years later, 
as a lawyer I wanted to know. I wasn™t inte rested then of the mo
ney, in fact, I hated 
them. I don™t hate them mo re, you know, those who live in 
Germany
 today. I hate 
those who -- who sit back, committed all 
these crimes, yeah, I hated them. But not 
these that are here. And I ask because my cousins wanted to kno
w, aren™t we entitled 
to a proper inheritance, given th e value of
 our property that was taken from us? And

then she wrote another -- 
Q: What -- what year did you go back to 
Kiel
? 
A: 
Kiel
 we went -- was it 2001? 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: I went back to 
France
, I mean, on the thank you trip
 to the nuns and to th e 
Ros
 
family and to the 
Guyaux
 family and the 
Rozinsky
 family. I went to thank them. I 
made a -- a decision to do it. The 
Catholic archdiocese of southern
 California
 
helped me to locate this -- these -- these nu
ns, this order of -- turned out to be the 
order wh ere 
Bernadette 
was a member, and they utilized
 the Catholic archives in 
France
 and elsewhere. Incidentally, that co
ngregation was th-the congregation of 
nuns in 
La Soeu r de la Charité [speaks French]
. Well, I™m sure n o body will 
translate that properly. Anyway , they ha
ve acknowledged my
 -- my -- my being 
hidden by them. Th
ey have included me in their -- in
 their archive. Now, everything 
I have said, all right, the arrest and -- a
nd detention and death of my  father is 
recorded by the Fren ch
 government. It is recorded  by the German govern ment. It is 
attested to by 
[indecipherable]
 in his research, including the very shipment that he 
was in, and his death, 
ultimate death in -- in 
Majd anek
, by 
Lublin
. The fact that I 
recited, that I was honored by
 the Catholic archdiocese to 
be their poster child, right,

is a recorded event. It wa
s published in th eir distributed publication called, ﬁ
The 
Tidingsﬂ,
 and th is was published in  January  2001, because of the second Vatican  
and because of Pope pi -- Pope
 Pius -- John Paul 
th-the -- the -- the second. I have 
included m-many of the pages of the -- the 
i -- the historical research done by the 
French historian that I referred to
 in -- of the Jews of ther -- 
Lot-et-Garonne
, which 
confirms that what happened  to my  parent
s an-and to me. The 
German state where I 
was born, not only did acknowledge wh
at happened to  us, but they also 
acknowledge the -- the death of my  grandf
ather, my paternal grandfather and the -- 
the -- the last of my uncles, where they
 were sent and they were killed, at 
Riga. 
And 
the memorial is there,
 they are listed i-in the deaths
 of that camp, right, and I was 
sent all that documentation and th-the -- the e
fforts that they -- they
 are -- the city of 
Kiel
 is one of the sponsor of that par
ticular monument and maintenance, in 
perpetuity they told me. 
As I said, the city of 
Kiel,
 at my  request created finally, a 
memorial to the Jews which basically I ha
ve to say that all of these efforts, 
throughout, that wh
at™s happened in 
Kiel
 has centered basically on my  family, 
because the museum in 
Kiel
 is cen ter -- as I said, of 
-- of memo rial and photos and 
so forth, which ha-has my -- 
my cousins, my family in it.
 So, I have to say that my 
family is h o nored. It™s sad to have that as
 an inheritance, but we
 don™t feel sorry for 
ourselves. We move fo rward, we prevail, 
all right. We -- we meet the challenges,

and I -- I say that not as a s -- matter of sp
eech, but this is a ma
tter o f absolute fact. 
So in wh at you ask, you know, the que
stion of how did you emotionally, as I 
understand, I mean, cope with different th
ing? Well, I™ll give you the proof. The 
proof of the pudding is what is the botto m of
 the balance sheet, right. What is it that 
you did with  your life? What is it that your brother did? What is it your mo th er did? 

Well, I™ll tell you wh at my  mo ther did. Sh e 
sacrificed everything fo r her two sons. 
She wo rk ed like hell. Every day she would 
travel, you understand, by th e bus, you 
know, from
 Oakland
 to  
Sa n F rancisco
. Every day of her 
life, right, until she 
retired. Every day she worked
 to  earn enough money, right, so we could go to 
school, you know? Not depend 
on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know. 
We -- she did it. Now su re, we had a little bit 
of help from my inheritance, we had a 
little help that was given to her in-in 
-- in some reparati
on, you know, by the 
German government. Some by a pension of 
France
, right, cause they were ab-
absolutely guilty of 
complicity, you know, to 
the murder of my father. I mean, that™s 
absolute. I condemn them as 
total accomplices, okay. The fa
ct that my father™s name 
is on the memo rial of the de
ad in  my  town , right, the only Jew that is so honored , 

you know, i-is -- is a -- is
 -- is a proof of the fact 
that some French people 
recognized the enormity of
 their complicity. But to so
me degree, we have to 
understand, you know, they ha
d limited choices. They coul
d only act at the peril of

153
their own life, and they ha
d to depend on ev erybody else
. So, you know, in this 
whole ballgame, right, who are the only r
eal, real monster? Of course, it™s the 
German. This educated, right, most advanc
ed culture of all became induced and 
seduced by these -- these -- th
ese monsters. So they™re al
l accomplices, they™re all 
murderers. Under the laws 
the way we have it in the 
United States
, if you are an 
accomplice before the fact or after the fa
ct to a murder, you are guilty of murd er. 
They are guilty of murder, period. All of th
em. That™s it. Now, ag
ain, the -- the -- the 
importance of my  statement here is that 
there is balance. An
d those who surv ived, 
some of them have survived 
that they can see, still see 
the evil and the dark of what 
happened , and yet live a beautif
ul life, without forgiv ing, without forgetting. I will 
never forget the murderers of
 my father. Never forget the pain and suffering they 
inflicted on my mother. And it would be 
a dishonor to me or anybody who lived 
through what I lived through, 
not to honor their mother a
nd father, or their relatives, 
right, for their horrible, horrible death, yo
u know. And that is the legacy. And I ask 
myself, why was I allowed to live? You 
know, why was I spar
ed? Well, I believe 
this is one of the reasons. This collection 
of work , my  testimony here, right. I didn™t 
give it earlier because I didn™t have all 
the documents that I wanted, right. Now I 
have it. Now I give it, and I give my  judgme
nts, too. I answer your inquiry, but I™m 
willing to give it to you in a sense of sa
ying I condemn what 
should be condemned.

Okay , there is one other point that I need to make. The 
United Sta tes
 
of America
, 
to its credit, has learned from the serious, hor
rible injustices that were done to the 
Jews of 
Europe
. And in  its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the 
past but not to the Jew, they
 became very generous to others. And that is a credit, 
because in the 
United States
, after they recognized what
 they had done wrong or 
been comp licit with, they were 
among the first, if not the first to reco gnize the state 
of
 Israel
. They are, and stood, often alone be
tween 1945 and -- and now -- or ™48, to 
be mo re correct, and now, to stand and protect 
Israel
, provide them arms and money 
and -- and support, politi -- many, many, many 
time the lone country, the lone voice. 
Many, many time 
France
 and 
England
, right, who sh ould have su pported, right, 
Israel
, they voted th e other way or
 they remained silent. The 
United States
 
of 
America
, to  its great credit, also grew up and 
learned. And the fact that we today 
even consider that a black could be president of the 
United States
, or a woman 
become president of the 
United States
 finally, I think in great part is the lessons that 
were learned by the 
United Sta tes
 to the wrongs that they
 committed to the Jews. So 
the generosity of this country,
 and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a d ebt 
of repaymen t to wh at they didn™t do to  th
e Jews. But that doesn™t diminish my  love 
for this country. 
Q: In closing, is there any short message yo
u wanted to  give to 
your grandchildren?
