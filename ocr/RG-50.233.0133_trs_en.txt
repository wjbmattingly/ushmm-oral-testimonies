My name is Flore nce Tabrys now, by my marriage  a nd I was bo rn in

with mein grandp arents in this o ne house and I w ent to school in  

the day and mein brothers went to school and we had a nice life  

before the w ar br oke out.  It was very nice, w e wasn't rich, we  was  

poor people.  My father was a shoe maker and my  brot hers helped out  

and I was the  o ldest from the girls and I hel ped also i n the  

household with my  mother and we w as very happy.  W e went to Hebrew 

school, we went to school and I had a lot of friends and we was  

surrounded with family, we went to each others h ouse.  We didn't 

have to call nob ody.  We just walked in and  my p arents was ver y,  

very religious,  m y grandparents... we had to  go  to te mple on sa turday  

and on the h olida ys.  And my broth ers had to g o to temple on these  

occasions and then until the Germans came in, in 1939 and stopped 

everything.
 
 

Did you speak Yid dish at home?
 
 

Yes, Yiddish.
 
 

Can you tell me what you wer e ca lled in Euro pe?  What was  your 

name?

Schwarzfink. My maiden name was S chwarzfink.
 
 

Is there anyway t hat you can desc r ibe to me what  it  looked like in 

Szydlowiec, Polan d (side A)?
 
 

 
 
 
It was a small t own but it was v ery nice and it was a nice, good  
relationship with  friends, we u sed  to sing and  laug h and always be 

happy with our fa milies and um..I used to belong to  an organization 

called the Bund.
 
 

Oh, your....?
 
 

Yeah.
 

 

Were there all di fferent organizat ions?
 

 

 

Yes.  There was like  Hashomer Hatzair, there we re all different  

kinds. So I belonged to the Bund.That was right before the war 

broke out. I t di dn't last too lon g.
 

 

Now the Bund was not Zionist, was it?
 

 

No.
 

 

Did your family h ave any...
 
 

They didn't know about it.
 
 

Oh, they didn't k now that you were  involved in it?
 
 

No, but you know, as we got older, we wanted tobreak out and do 

different things  and belong to s omething and hav e fun and enjoy 

ourselves and get  together there a nd that is what w e did.
 

I 
don't remember  if my parents k new, I think the y knew about my 
brothers belongin g, I don't know whether they knew about me.So, 

my brothers took me in also, so Ishould enjoy myself a little bit.  

Like at home, Sat urdays, we was  ve ry religious and  you couldn't do 

anything.  Ov er t here, you was lik e free, you could  do whatever yo u  

pleased.  So that  didn't last too long.Then, the war broke out.
 
 

But you had finis hed school then?
 
 

No. Not completel y.
 

 

You hadn't?

No.I didn't  hav e a chance.
 
 
So, you were
 
stil l in public schoo l.
 
 

Yes.
 

 

What about other schools?
 

 

 

I went to He brew school.  To Chede r, and then I had  a tutor coming 

into the house  to  teach me Polish and Yiddish too,  yeah.  And then 

for  a while I wa s doing this.  My  sister was doing  the same  
thing  

and my brothers  h ad finished schoo l and then it  st opped.  As soon 

as the Germans ca me in 
- 
it  s topped.  Everythi ng.
 
 

Before we get to  that point in 19 3 9, what I am sort  of looking for 

and asking what i t looked like

No. No water, no toilet in the house and we was seven kids.  How we  

did it, I don't know.  I still don't know to thi s day, I keep on  

explaining this  t o my children  tod ay.  Because if t hey complain, I 

tell them that th ey have three bed rooms and they so metimes say that 

it is not enough so I explain this to them all the time.  We didn't  

have that.  Frida y, every friday,  we

because we had li ce 
- 
even  before the war 
- 
we  had  lice.  Because  
we lived so together.You know,  two kids in one bed. It wasn't  

like here 
- 
ever y child

brothers and families, you went with this friend, you went to the 

other grandparent s and uncles and  cousins

the two of them was born the same 
night and a midwife

a midwife

grandfather, but  the midwife said ,  you going  to be like a pair,  you 

going to be marri ed and that is ho w it happened.

She laid down in  bed, and she  alwa ys used to  pray  I  don't want to 

be sick, I would  like to l ay down  and die.  She  lay  down, st opped

mother was cleaning and cooking and baking and doing things, 

everything for th e family.

every two years she had an other child, my 
mother.I am  192 5, she had him ri ght after she got  married. 
 

 

So he was born in  like 1921?
 
 

Something like th at.
 

 

And he had the sa me schooling sit u ation as you?  He  had the c heder 

and than...
 
 

Yeah, yeah sure.
 
 

O.k.  Then he wou ld have been  fini shed with school  by the time  the 

war started.
 
 

He was finished a nd he was working  with my 
father.
 
 

So he was trained  as a shoe maker?
 
 

 

Yeah.  That  is ho w it went in Euro pe.  What t he fat her did, the son  

did.
 

 

Do you want to th en discuss what h appened then?
 
 

And then it star t the war in 1939.  I remember like it would be 

now.  We hear d ta lking about the w ar, but we didn't want to believe 

it.  And then in 1939, the German s  came in a nd then  was completely  

different.  We di dn't have real ly a ghetto, it  was certain streets  

- 
we wasn't allowed to go there 
- 
to walk. And at night, we couldn't 

 
 
 
 
8
 
walk.  How did they call t his?  I don't remember  how they  said  
this.We cou ldn' t go outside at n ight.
 

 

A curfew?
 
 

Curfew, yes.  We couldn't walk a t night but we was still in ou
r 

house, it was di fficult, we didn 't have everythi ng like before. 

Before, my father  and my brother s worked and we h ad  pretty good to  

eat and everyth in g 
- 
we ha d everyt hing.  But after that, when they 
came in 
- 
it was completely differ ent,  My father u sed to make  his  

own shoes and sen t them to  market  to sell.  And th en he couldn' t do 

that.So, it  was  a little differe nt.
 

 

Were these leathe r shoes?
 

 

Leather shoes. G ood homemade sho es.  Good shoes.   I wish I would  

have now a pair o f shoes like  this .  So,  it was  dif ferent then when 

the Germans came in and they used to grab to work.They took my 

father, he was a w ay like for six  w eeks 
- 
it was  very bad when they 
took him away.W e thought we never gone see him and then finally  

they send him ba ck home and then  they used to, l ike every night,  

they said 
- 
we heard rumors 
- 
like, "tonight they are going to grab 
boys."  So everybody was hiding,  so they took girls.  So it was 

pretty bad.  And then finally, one  day, they chased  us all out from 

the house. That w as already in 194 2.
 

 

How did you get f ood during this t hree year period?
 
 

Haah, it wasn't easy.  It was ve ry hard but somehow we ate.  I  

can't remember ev erything, you kno w, my father used  to work for the 

Polish people and  they used to  com e in and bring  po tatoes and some  

different things  and somehow we ate.  And he wor ked but not like  

before 
- 
I  said  b efore that h e use d to work  and g o  to markets  and 
sell in differen t towns.  And when the Germans c ame in was very  

difficult.  And t hen one day, they  came and they ch ased us all  out 

from the house. We left everythin g and we went to this one place 

and they start p icking and they picked me and my  younger sister, 

which the two of  us survived and  my two older br others they took.  

And they separate d the boys sep ara te and the gir ls separate and my  

parents they s end  back somehow  and  my younger  siste rs and brother s.  

The very younges t stayed with my  grandfather at home, because my  

grandfather was  still alive.  A n d I never, never  saw them since 

that day.  We wer e separated, I  
- 
we
 
went to  a diff erent camp.  We  

 
 
 
 
9
 
went to Skarszisk o, they cal led i t, in Polan d.  W e walked, a s  a 
matter of fact t o this place.  W e worked ammunit ion there.  They  

called it 
vitforn ya
 
ph 210.
 
 

You made ammuniti on?
 

 

We made ammuni tio n.  I stayed by two big machin es  and I made the 

ammunition and y ou had to work t welve day shifts  for the shells, 

you poured in the  shells like smal l, and they came  out this long.  

You had 
--
 
that was very, very h ard. These machi nes went on soap  
water.  You had t o pour in the  wat er 
- 
the soap  wat er 
- 
you had  to 
pour in the mate r ial and you had  t o check them for  sabotage and if 

you made sabotage  they could  kill  you on the  spot.  You had  to have 

always material i n the machine and  I had two  machin es working like  

this.  Two machines, twelve hours by day and the  other week was  

twelve hours by  n ight 
- 
shifts  
- 
w ork shifts.  So y ou slept during  
the day and you worked at night.   And then, every few days, was 

like selections.  You didn't know the next day what  is going to be.  

And we had nothin g
 
to eat.  We had a slice of brea d with a little  
soup and you h ave to survive.   I was...I was like ninety 

pounds...'til the  liberation  we ha d nothing to eat,  nothing to  wear,  

one thing foreve r  we had on  and I  was sleeping  on  _____? ph232  
-
  
bunks, like nothi ng to cover yours elf, a little hay  
- 
nothing.
 
 

You said you were  with your sister  this whole time?
 
 

I was with my 
- 
t hat was the only good thing.  I was with my sister  
all over.The y u sed to pick my s ister somehow. T hey always used 

to pick her, but we didn't know which way 
- 
if they pick her for 
the good or for t he bad.And I al ways used to say that I want to 

go with my sister  so they let me.
 
 

She was two years  younger than you ?
 

 

She was two year s younger th an I  am, shorter  tha n I am.  She's  

small.  But
 
w e wa s always together .Somehow.
 
 

So you managed to  stay with her.
 
 

Yeah.That w as a  miracle.Ye ah. We stayed togethe r.
 

 

So you slept in t hese barracks....
 
 

 
 
 
 
10
 
Big barracks.  A nd we used  to come home from  the  night shift  and  
the barrack was closed and they used to pick out  people from the  

barrack and we s aw them and they  were shooting t hem in the woods  

for no reason at all.And it was terrible, what can I tell y
ou?  

I was 
- 
we was two years in ph249 Scargin in dis Hossock
?????   
working like thi s , than they  sent us to Czenstachow  ph 250 an d from 

Czenstachow, they  sent 
- 
I was in Bergen Belsen. 
 
 

What year did you  arrive in Bergen  Belsen?
 

 

I think in Berg en  Belsen was lik e `44 because then  they shipped us 

every few weeks i n a different pla ce and in Bergen  Belsen I don' t  

remember how lo ng  I was th ere, was  also terrible.  Over there they  

was burning people.There was th e ovens there especially the men 

was unbelievable .  Thin and sick and was select ions there too. 

Every single d ay  was a selection  and you didn't know where the y 

were going to tak e you.
 

 

When you were in  Skarszisko, did  you know about the other camps, 

about the extermi nation camps?
 
 

Yes. Because the  Polish people use d to come to  work  and go home so 

that's how we kne w things.
 
 

So they would tel l you?So th ey k new?
 

 

They knew.  They  knew more  but we heard rumors , we heard more  or  

less what happene d to our parents  and to the rest  
- 
we heard about  
Auschwitz 
and all these things. Yeah, we knew about it.We 
- I 
was crying for  tw o years, I cou ldn 't believe what  h appened and you 

know, such a big  family 
- 
w ith c ousins and uncle s  and you know 
- 
your own parents  and everything.  So 
- 
then I was i n Bergen Belsen  
- 
I don't remembe r 
- 
not too long. Couple of m onth s maybe.
 
 

Did you work ther e?
 

 

No 
- 
nothing.  F rom Czenstachow ph276 on, we did n't work 'til we  
was liberated.  T hey had nothing t o give us to work . Nothing.  T hey 

told us to sit do wn tight and pick  the lice
. 

 

You didn't have a ny food.
 

 

No, one piece  of bread, a little  s oup and black  cof fee.  And, as a 

 
 
 
 
11
 
matter of fact, t hey used to cut  t he girls' hair o f f and me and my 
sister, we used to share the coffee that we didn't drink 
- 
and we 
used to watch  our  hair.  We was ne ver cut the hair off.  We always  

had the hair.  And we tried our best and another  thing was very 

good 
- 
be cause we was sick .  Befor e we went  to  the  camps, a t home  
still, we had the typhus. The who le family had the typhus and we  

was somehow not sick during the camps, not me an d not my sister.  

And that's how 
- 
I don't  know how we survived  
- 
so from Bergen  
Belsen we went to 
Burgau
 
ph290, they send us.Also we were there  
like six weeks  do ing nothing, just  sitting there  an d talking about  

your family, abou t your home, remi nding yourself wh at you did when  

it came a holid ay and things l ike that, doing  nothing.  Abou t 

food...what we us ed to cook, wha t your mother used  to give to you.  

That's all that w as on your mind  . .. and praying t o  God you should 

survi
ve and have a piece of bread to eat. 
 
 

 

Did you encounter  people from othe r countries?
 
 

Oh yeah, yes, fro m all other.
 
 

You did?  Not  in Skarszisko ph 303 ?
 

 

In Skarszisko?
 
 

There were people  from other...
 
 

Sure 
- 
from other towns.
 
 

Were there people  from other count ries?
 

 
No. Not from othe r countries.  From around Poland . From other town s.  

And you met people from Romania 
- 
from all over people came.An d  
then we went to a nother little tow n 
- 
wasTurkine
 
p h 309, over there  
was really, re all y so bad,  we used  to live  in 
       
 
ph 310 from 
potatoes, how do you call that?  L ittle like...when  you go camping  

and you have  a li ttle...you make  y ourself a litt le. .to sleep.  How 

you call that? T hat's how we used  to sleep.
 
(Survivor's husb and interjects 
- 
Dugouts.  Where you keep 
potatoes.)  Yeah, that's how we u s ed to live.  Layi ng on 
preach
 
ph  
315 like that, ev erybody next  to e ach other.  It  wa s really diverse  

there and we wasn't there too long and then they took us from there 

- 
we walked 
- 
as a matter of fact  to Dauchau  (?) ph 322 and I  was in  

 
 
 
 
1
2
 
Dachau and from D achau I was liber ated.Yeah.
 
 
And in al l this  t ime you d idn't wo rk in any  of  thes e places?  You  

were taken and ta ken and taken?
 
 

Taken from one p lace to the othe r and doing noth ing.  Nobody did  

anything.  Ye ah
. People was dying  every minute of the day. 
 

 

Were there doctor s?
 

 

No doctors.  The  people were layi ng right in front  of the barracks  

where they used t o live.
 

 

When were you lib erated?
 

 
I was liberated  a ctually the same  time as my husb an d, in April 30, 

1945 by the American army.  They came and we was laughing and  

crying, we thought we saw our parents 
- 
we didn't know what to do 
with ourselves.  We were h appy 
- 
a nd like I  said,  w e had nob o
dy 
- 
we had no family. But we felt like first we wasafraid 
- 
we were 
hidden out 
- 
we  w ere afraid t o com e out 
- 
and fin al ly we came  out 
and the American s was there and they were so good to us.  As a  

matter of fact,  t hey was too  good,  they start  cooking and
 
giving  us 
so good food 
- 
like too fat things.  And the people  who ate it, (it 
was a good thing me and my sister didn't touch that) the people who 

ate that 
- 
they died.It was to o much because we was so skinny.  
Me and my sister c ouldn't recognize  ourselves.  That's how we looked  

like 
- 
so skinny and unbelievable.So then the Americans started  
to give us injections and give us the food and we stayed in these 

barracks where t h e Hitler Jungen
 
p h used to stay an d then they  took 
us to 
Felderfinj
 
ph358, and that 's when I met my  husband.  Yeah,
