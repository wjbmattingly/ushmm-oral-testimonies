prisoners, as sport.

A: She Œ she was a very humorous, can you say it? Very funny person. 

Q: Mm-hm. She had a sense of humor. 

A: She Œ yeah, a lot. And we had a lot of Œ we laughed all  the da y. She was really 
with us, and she was not pretending to learn us anything, and she never dealt with 
us like we are princes of the governor general, or something like t his. We were 

really typically chil dren in her e yes, and she go Œ went swimmi ng wit h us, and 

doing everyt hing. She was really Œ she Œ she loved us, I would sa y.

Q: Yeah. Did she hav

Œ 
this sounds so
 Œ I mean, even as I sa y it, to me it 
sounds so silly, but did she have any political l eanings? Did she have any Œ  

A: 
Hilde

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t think so. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: I never heard anyt hing like Œ I also have to admit, I never hea

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Ma ybe t he y have talked about it, but I don™t  remember.

A: Yes. 

Q: It was him and you?

Q: What about your older siblings? Your two sisters and your brother, where were 
they, in your first years, during these war years? 

A: The y both were at 
Kraków
 and 
Kressendorf
 and Lake

a 
very poor girl. She committed suicide when Œ 
she never wanted to become older than our father, and she committed suicide when 
sh
ebecame 46 years ol d.
 

Q: Which was his age. 

A: Was his age when he was hanged. 

Q: We™ll come to that, but I™d like to get a sense of the personaliti es. When she was 

young, you sa y she was talented, and she used to draw, yes? And she was quiet. 

Why did you
 think she was stupid, as a lit tle boy? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

A: Oh, it i s just Œ  I never thought t hat she was hi Œ we couldn™t deal with her. She 
was out of our range, or something. It was by t he wa y she was a girl. 

Q: Well, I know that. 

A: What could you do with girls when you are five, six, seven years old? 

Q: Oh, the y™re useless. They™re usel ess, you know. But what about the Œ

A: 
Norman

A: Yes, she pla yed wit h us. She made a l ot of bloody things wit h us. 

Q: Such as?  

A: I will never forget. I got a big chocolate, yes? And he Œ this guy, wanted to get  Œ 
have this chocolate, instead of me. So she Œ he put the Œ 
a blanket aroundhis 
shoulders. I was si tting with my chocolate. 

Q: Defending it. 

A: And he was kneeling before, pretending to be a beggar, sa ying to me, 
Niki

ets Œ I am called

A: But on the other end, he made Œ he filled with our Œ a lot of snow then, in upper 
Bavaria
 during winter, he built big castles, and attacking us. We were sitting inside 

the ice and snow castle, and he attacking us wi th big mines, he cal led them, and 

boom, and it was really funny. Was really a very funny guy. 

Q: That™s a lot of fun, yeah. So he was somebody who was engaged with the 
younger ones. He was somebody he di Œ it wasn™t like you were young and Œ 
A: I w Œ 
I won™tsay it™sengagement. Wh
en he had ti me, and we were around hi m, 

we Œ ma ybe we have begged him that he should pla y wit h us, and he did it. And it 

was very funny. 

Q: And what about  
Sigrid
? 

A: 
Sigrid
 wasn™t so funny. 
Q: She wasn™t? 
A: And she was also, she was a girl. 
Q: Yeah. Enough said. Enough sai d. 

A: So 
she was
 
far off,
 she was far away from us, also from age, and she had quite 
other interests. 

Q: Well, she was 12 years older than you were. 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
27
 
Q: And so she Œ I guess what I™m trying t o do is get a sense of how your Œ the 
siblings in your early years interacted with each other. How invol ved were you Œ 

A: I th Œ I Œ I woul d say, we were a happy family. We didn™t know how bad the 

marriage was between our parents, first. It started in ™42, when the marriage broke Œ 

nearly broke. But before, and also where the children were together, it was alwa ys a 
big laughter. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Alwa ys. We were fond of each other. 

Q: That is what I wanted to get a sense of. 

A: That™s for sure. And we also played wit h 
Gitty
(ph), with our next older girl, but 
it wasn™t the same Œ 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ as 
Mi ke
 and me. And we had a lot of adventures, and Œ 
everywhere.
 
Q: Such as? What kind of adventures would li ttle Œ  
A: Stealing, lying, fishing, which was not allowed, and hurting other people, and 

when the grand Œ our grandmother, the mother of m y father was li ving with us i n 

Poland
, i n the castle of 
Kressendorf
, 
Sigrid 
told that Œ t old us she is a witch. So 

we Œ we did a lot of awful things like putt ing dirt in front of her door, where her 

apartment was 
[indeci p
herable]
 we had a reall y adventurous life. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016

Q: When you sa y t hese things, though, stealing and lying can be seri ous, or the y can 
be the sorts of things al l children do, that i s candies, or Œ 

A: I Œ I Œ I won™t sa y that other children are doing this. 

Q: Oka y, so these Œ 

A: I think I have Œ I have thought about m yself a lot of it. For instance, we got a lot 
of toys. Every visitor t o m y father, brought a lot of toys for the children, especially 
for 
Mikey
 and me. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And we got Œ we got the toys, and we went  to our rooms, and we immediately 

destroyed t he toys. We also, for instance with our trains, and we had l orries, which 

we™re driving, some sort. We alwa ys were bui lding accidents. We were never 

interested i n the normal pla ying t hat the train i s rolling through a room. Was boring. 
But if you build up accidents, where you demolish all these Œ these new toys, we 
were happy. And I would sa y one of the reasons is that our parents, and all the other 

grownups, knew exactly that they don™t have t o do nothing in 
Poland
, and the y saw 
all the hanged people, Polish ones, the y saw t he Jews with the st ars, the y saw the 

hungry faces, the y knew exactly what Œ that t hey commi tted every day the most  

horrible crimes, and they all were involved, and this bad consci ous 
t h ey 
had Œ it™s 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

m y interpretation 
Œ went down in a certain way, t o the children. And therefore, we 
are destroyi ng everythi ng which we got as gift. My interpretation. 
Q: Oka y. But it would have been a silent ki nd of transmittal. That is, nobody tol d 

you, of the grownups. 

A: No, no, never. 
Q: Of course not. 
A: No, never. 

Q: Were you, in the German word, 
v erwö hnt
? Spoiled?  
A: Yes. My Œ m y father and m y mother wasn™t 
interested to 
Œ to educated us, and to 
Œ something like 
typical
 German people. It was all 
Hilde
(ph). She decided what we 
have to eat, and where. It was not special, and we Œ nobody told us that we are 

princes of the governor general, something like this. So we were Œ 
in thiswa y, we 
were quite normal, but we knew, as I told you with m y li ttle car, we knew that we 
have some i mportant guy in the background. 

Q: Yes, but did 
H ilde
(ph) ever discipline you? That is, if you Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ did something wrong Œ 

A: No, I Œ I don™t remember that she ever Œ she never clapped me, or Œ 

Q: Or talked to you and sa y, this is not something that you should be doing? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

A: I don™t remember. She must have, for sure. She must have. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But in a good wa y. 

Q: Yeah. Because in every child™s l ife, the sense of what is right, and what is 

wrong, has to be introduced by somebody. 
A: That was 
Hilde
(ph). That was 
Hilde
(ph). 
Q: Oka y. Okay.  
A: But in a informal way. She never gave us l essons. Toda y we speak about not 

stealing. 

Q: Of course, of course. But it™s Œ you know, i f your parents weren™t involved, if 

they were, you know, distracted, or doing other things, somebody had to. 

A: Yeah, that was 
Hilde
(ph).  
Q: That was her. Tell me a little bit about your mother. And what do you remember 

of her during those years. Like I said with your father. 

A: Just Œ I really Œ it was after the war that I really started to get some knowledge of 

who m y motherwas.
 

Q: Oka y, are there episodes? Like we ask Œ you know, you remember your father 

with the shaving cream, and in the 
Bellevue
 and Œ

A: Oh yeah, that™s Œ that™s one scene, the castl e of 
Kresse
ndo rf 
was a little bit l ike 
Versailles
, but very smaller. But from one room t o the Œ on the other side, you have 
to go about a hundred met ers. So, our chi ldren rooms were on this si de, and the 

apartment of my mother was right on the other side. And 
Mikey
 told me, now let ™s 
be funny. You run to our mother, t elling her t hat 
Mikey
 is dead. And he la y down. I 
was, oh, that™s a very good idea. And run along this Œ in the first floor, this long 

corridor.And m y mothe

[indecipherable]
. And I said 

to her, 
Mutte

Mutte
(ph),

Michael 
is dead. 
Q: 
Michael
 is dead. 
A: And she jumped, naked as she was, jumped out, took a towel, and run behind me 

to the room where Œ 

Q: Through this l ong corridor.  
A: Œ this long corridor, wet, every Œ and entered really, and mi Œ 
Mikey
 was lying 
dead. And she knelt down, and then 
Mikey
 st arted to laugh. And I got the clap into 
m y face of m y mot her, she was so horrified. But this also is a scene which shows to 
me, children knew there™s somethi ng wrong. Where we are living, what we are 

doing, and so, I think it . 

Q: What ki nd of a person was 
Michael
? I asked about all the others, but about him, 

what kind of a Œ

Q: Mm-hm, curly hair. 
A: Curly hairs. Very funny, full of wit. And he was so 
sportiv

with stones. I admired hi m a lot. 

Q: Well, he™s your older brother. 

A: Yes, but he was real ly, really great guy. And he loved especially, his father. 

Q: He loved your father. 

A: Oh, very much. 

Q: How did this show i tself? 
A: Ah, he always was looking for hi m, I would say. It™s m y remembrance. I Œ I 
could put i t on Œ on really on scenes, but you Œ you know what your brother is like, 

that he loved your father more than me. 

Q: Even when you were a little boy? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: When you compare it that wa y? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
33
 
A: Yeah, you have t o remember the scene, when I was very young, and from this 
point when I was runni ng around t he round table, there was a really, healthy 

distance between my father and me.  

Q: When he called you a stranger.  

A: Yeah. And don™t let me get into his arms. And this was Œ it was my s Œ it saved 
me. It saved me, because later 
Mikey
 defended, like three others, our father, the 
innocent victi m. I never did. So I had an Œ I had an advance. But he loved Œ back to 
Mikey
, he loved hi m very much, and he was very sad when he was hanged. And Œ 
Q: What di d Œ what Œ what did he do when Œ when he learned of that? When you 

say sad.
 

A: He started to cry. He cried a lot, and ah, he was really Œ we had to comfort him. 

Q: Oh. He was distraught. 
A: Yes, he was distraught.

sportiv

started suddenly to drink milk, til Œ til 13 liters a day. 

Q: Thirteen liters a da y? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

A: And he married, and his wife didn™t know where to hi de the milk for the babies, 
because 
Mi key
 was searching all t he house, to find all the last milk for the babies, 
and drank it . 

Q:Oh m y goodness.
 

A: And became, as you can i magine, fatter and fatter and fatter. And I think it was 
because he couldn™t get around with his father.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: It was Œ  the oldest brother, 
Norman
, became an alcoholic. The second Œ the 

eldest daughter, 
Si grid

dying.

father. And who is still alive, and very happy? 
Niklas
.  
Q: And you put it down to the favor, from the very beginning, that your father did 

you when he woul dn™t take you in his arms. 

A: I Œ I would sa y so. I would sa y so. I ma y Œ 
ma ybe at 
Œ and I™m very, very happy 
that he was hanged. I am completely against death penalty, but in this case, he had 

earned it. And i magine he would have survived? He would have poisoned my brain, 

when you are young. That™s not easy, to li ve with a guy who was so well educated 

as m y father was.

very good, very detailed. Very, very good Œ  
A: Oh yeah. I had to rewrite them. 

Q: You sai d when you were little, and he di dn™t take you i n his arms and Œ in this 

Schloss Bellevue
, were Œ you were stunned. Is that right? How come he doesn™t do 
it, I™m being rejected? And that™s the feeling you had of distance? Is t his what I™m 
tryi ng to understand? 
A: I Œ I would sa y I don™t have the same sentence had Œ in my brain. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You Œ you notice it. 

Q: You feel it, yeah. 

A: You feel it, and you Œ you have only t wo possibilities. You endure it, 
or you are 

broken. And with me I was happy that I could endure it. Maybe because of 
Mikey
, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

because I was very happy with 
Mi key
. Ma ybe because of

experienced, because of m y little car, because of all what I experienced. Becaut of Œ 

because of killing fishes, and killi ng birds around the lake of

heaven. And for me it was just informati on, I was Œ I knew it already, because we Œ 

when we visited him last ti me, I knew that  he will be hanged. So for me it was quite 

a confirmation.

A: No, no. And so Œ and

was starting to cry. And m y mother said t o them, why do you cry? Your father is 

happy in heaven now, and look at

pragmatic i n m y life. Now I knew the next time we will see our mother, she will tell 

us that our father is dead. 

Q: You knew it, but no adult had told you that this woul d be. 

A: Well, in the summer of ™46, his lawyer, Dr.
 
Zeidel

Q: You were Œ you were in earshot of this?

it was 
Œ I knew it then. I know it was connecting wi th the visit of 

Mr. 
Zeidel
(ph). And everybody el se, also my brother 
Norman

talked to each other about it. I don™t know exactly the conversations any more. But I

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ for you, and it  was you and all of his chil dren, and your mot her.

talked to him a lot during our life, that it was 
Zei del™s

hopes Œ 
or theirhopes, not my hope 
Œ that he will survive. And by the wa y, 
whenever I was already in school, and I came to school i n the autumn of ™45. And

the 
Nuremberg 
trial was broadcast ed. Every evening there was one hour the y

the family of the other children, the parents of them, the y™re talking about it. Also
 

Hans Frank
 was in the prison in 
Nuremberg
, and that™s this big trial . And the 
children in m y school sometimes said to me, one of them, that, hi 
Niki

know now your father will be hanged. And I said yes. So, it was some Œ it wasn™t 

cruel. The y knew it. 

Q: It was common knowledge. 

A: It was common knowledge, yes.  

Q: Oka y. I want to Œ I™l l jump ahead, and t hen I™ll move back.

write, that when the communicati ons wit h your father ceased Œ 
that is, youkept 
Œ 

you know, in the séance, the y kept wanting to bring his spirit up, you yourself tried 

to do so. I think it  was, you know, if Uncle 
J ul ius
 was a butterfl y, then you were 
seeing, was your father here, was your father there. And it  ended up with a little 
dog, that you thought maybe his spirit had rested in the little dog? 
A: Yes, but was Œ was more on the funny side, in the Œ in this book. This, with the Œ 

with the butterfl y i s correct. It wasn™t me, but i t was 
Tante Marta
(ph) Œ 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Œ she was sitti ng in t he English garden, and sudd
enly Uncle 
Julius
 came along 
as a butterfly. 

Q: The butterfly. 
A: And the dog also as well, yes. 
Q: The reason why I bring it up i s that when I read that passage, yes, I know it was 

supposed to be humorous, but it also gave me a sense of a child who i s mis
sing his 

father, who wonders whether his father is here, his father is there, his father is 

someplace el se.
 
A: Ma ybe. 

Q:Did you miss him?

A: I didn™t know hi m. Hm. I™m not sure. I Œ I would sa y, more I would sa y because 
asanormal child, you are missing 
your father, it could be, for sure. But it™s not 
something which haunt s me.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Or has haunted me. Could be. The good thi ng was in t his ti me, that a lot of 
families, they lost t heir father due to the war. They all were killed in the 
W ehrma cht
. So, i t was comparable to other fami lies who Œ where the children al so 
grew up without a father. The special thing on the 
Frank 
family and this, it was like 

an honor. You were special because your father got a year long tri al, and 

afterwards, he wasn™t shot by a Russian in the war, or by a French, or an English, 

but he was hanged, so t hat was special. 
So  
Œ  
Q: Prestigi ous, in a way? 
A: In a wa y, prestigious. We were somethi ng special. And, don™t forget, my father 
was sitting in the first row of the defendants, 
no
t in the second one.  
Q: Even more special. 

A: My mother liked it, my mother, it™s even more special.

all this kind of stuff was always there. 

Q: So it was like a Œ a government building? It was a castle, but it  was a 
government  buildi ng? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, well, a lot of government in it, and that was our weekend castle. 

We enjoyed itvery much.
 

Q: The 
Wawel

A: So you Œ most ly was there. Then he Œ his official castle was the 
Wawel
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Where he did all his work during the day. But on weekends, and also during the 

weekend, he could decide when he was Œ want s to work or not. So he was very

Q: So describe to me both places. What di d they look like, and what were the y? 

A:

y memo ry.
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: More memories, I exactly knew Œ to know this, 
Kressendorf

Wawel

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ to the German big shots. 

Q: So what kind of festivities were these? 

A: The y were really with big candelabras, and really everybody in wonderful 

clothes, and we had to give everybody our hand, and hand kisses to t he women.

and we mixed it up, we then kissed the hands of the guys, and then made our 
[bows]
 to the ladies, and so on. Was funny. 

Q: So tell us, so t hat now is not from the e yes of a child, but so t hat people will 

know, these are not just any old places in buil dings, in Polish history. Can you tell 

us what was the 
Wa wel
, what was 
Kressendorf
, what was 
Bellevue
? 
A: 
Wawel 
was 
Œ Wawel
 was the old capital of the Polish empire, let™s sa y it this 

way, and a l ot of Polish kings are buried inside the cathedral on the 
Wawel
. And the 
special thing is, unbelievable me til  nowadays, 
Mikey
 and I, we played seek-hide? 
Q: Hide and seek. 

A: Hide and seek, inside this cathedral. So we Œ we hided behind wonderful graves, 

and holy people, and Œ and lying Œ not down i n the catacomb where the Œ where all 

the 
Pilsudski
 is Œ 
had hisgrave. Butsomebody was
, that the y all owed us to pla y 
there, hide and seek. 
Q: So this is sort of like the central place of Polish kings? 

A: It was t he central  place for the Polish people. And i mmediately, my father 

forbade, when he took over 
[indecipherable]
 immediately shut it down, no Polish 
person coul d enter the cathedral, which was one of the most holy ones in Œ in 

Poland
, besides 

.

Kressendorf
 was really funny, because it was lot of Œ of small lake, and a lot  of 
very funny 
SS
 guys who pla yed with us, and we Œ mostly we were keen to eat with 
them, and not upst airs with the ki tchen of ours, so we liked the soldiers, as all the 

children. And the y were very nice t o us. 

Q: Were the y? And they we Œ these were 
SS
, rather than another branch, or not Œ 
not the pol ice, or 
Wehrmacht
, or anything li ke that? 
A: No, it was the 
SS
 who was guarding it. 
Q: So you had Œ you had these guards at your fami ly place, so you would be safe, in 

other words. 

A: Yes. Al so around the 
Wawel
. 

Q: Oka y.

Norman
, visiting t he German 
school in 
Kraków
, left with a cycle every morning, rode through a park, along 
streets, and nobody ever hunted him down or killed hi m. And that was really 

strange. 

Q: Toda y no one would do that. 

A: No. 

Q: No. What about 
Sigrid
? Was she going to school there too?  

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

elder, the one class ahead, one year ahead of him. And both were very happy there. 

Q: And 
Bellevue

Bellevue
? 

A: That Œ there must be Œ this must have happened when we visited 
Warsaw
.

as a 
Œ 
as a place?

journalist, I made an interview wit h

Lech Walesa

A: No, no, I would Œ never would have done t his.

 that 
I am telling hi m this. 
I alwa 
Œ 
Frank
 is a normal name, like 
Mill er
, or 
Becker
, or 
something. So I was al ways protected by m y name? He was a funny guy. 

Q: 
Walesa
?  

A: Mm-hm. I interviewed him first in 
Danzig

Q: Did you? 

A: He was very slim, and then he was the president, he was fat, and m y first

said, what can I do? Al l these gala dinners I have to attend, so I have to eat. Oh,

Q: My goodness, my goodness. But it does ill ustrate for us the Œ the rooms, the 

place, the structures of your childhood, were not Œ I™m talking physical structures,

I know, by chance, because the driver said, thi s is a 
Tiger
, was Œ was the biggest 
German tank, and one of the last inventions in Œ in the war, it was bui lt up. So i t 
must have been very late. This was Œ til nowadays, this burning tank on the side of a

Hitler
 took the time within the war, st opped all the 

slaughter and discussed this and forbade m y father to divorce til the end of the war.

of

a cell, and I saw a young lady sitti ng there, not  looking at us, but  she was really sad, 

sitting 
[indecipherable]
. And I started to cry
. And
 he comforted me, the guy, and 
that Œ that™s a very, very Œ  she is a witch, but you don™t have to cry, because she i s 
dead very soon.

 I 
asked only Mother, what are the y doing there? Those sad looking guys around here, 

and also I saw children of m y age l ooking very sad, because we al ways were 

looking very happy. And my mother refused to answer. And I wouldn™t have 

understood it, I have to say, those are Jews, and we don™t like the Jews, and the 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

Jews are no human bei ngs, and so Œ so we have to round them up in small parts of 
the city and the y Œ she would never have said this to me. 
Q: You Œ 
yeah, you 
Œ 
A: And I was not any more interested because as a child, the next  sensation is 

coming around the corner. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So that also sort of answers m y question of was there any 
mention of people like the Poles, or the Jews, i n conversation. 

A: No. As- As far Œ

m y mother became more silent, comforted me, and let it go. He wasn™t put into a 

concentration camp. I saved hi m. 

Q: Well, he thought so, and that™s t he i mportant part, you know. And it™s also Œ so, 

oka y, so now I get it Œ a picture. The Œ 
Kressendorf
 was heated by coal ovens.

I think most ofthem
 have survi ved. Because then, 
this one gentleman, he said he would have loved that also 
Niklas
 been sitting in this 
train, and the explosion would have been successful. So, both m y father and me. I 
think he meant wit h 
Ni klas
, all the family. And some Polish people were upset 

about it, and I said i mmediately, t hat™s oka y. That™s oka y. He is Œ man was right. 
We have kil led so many i nnocent children. Why should he be on the other wa y, 
because only that I am young, that  he don™t want to have killed me. I was on hi s 

side, and we shaked hands and I embraced hi m and it was very good. And shortly 

afterwards, he was dead. I met him nearly 15 years later, after he has told this 

sentence to a newspaper, as 
Niklas
. 

Q: So, you know, one of m y questions, which I had anticipated would be later on, 

but because we™re on 
Poland
, I wanted t o find out what kind of reacti on your book 
had had in 
Poland
 when you came out with it, and you wrote it. How did Œ how Œ it 
was still before solidari t y had happened, but it still was not yet an independent 
Poland
, and Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ that might have had some influence. 

A: If Œ I was a journali st with Œ with ﬁ

of very good books. 

Q: Ok
a y.
 
A: So, we printed ﬁ
Schlindler™s List
,ﬂ in 
Germany
 first, before it came out as a 
book. 
Q: Oh. 
A: And I was responsible, and everybody was responsible for reprinting this book, 

only parts of it, for sure, has to wri te big article. So it was my first visi t in 
Poland
 

again then
. And my int erpreterwas a mancal led 
Jarzyc

And 
Jarzyc

the Polish student s German 
with my book,ﬁ
Mój Ojciec
.ﬂ In ja Œ in Œ in Polish, 
ﬁ
The Father
,ﬂ or The Father. And the Polish students, of whom I™m sure, in every 
family m y father has ki lled some members, yes, they refused to learn German with 

such an ugly book.  

Q: Oh. 

A: Because of this foul language against the father. You can™t, as I have said to 

Jarzyc
(ph), we don™t want to learn German t hrough a guy who hates his father, and 

who is accusing hi s father in such a wa y. Isn™t  it wonderful?

A: And the second thing Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ 
when came 
Œ t he book came out in Polish then, and it was immediately bought, 
the whole circulation, from the Catholic church. The y also didn™t  want that their

Q: Really? 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And what year did i t come out, ™88 then, ™89? After the ™87

A: I think Polish was earlier. 
Q: Yeah. S o the Cathol ic church bought up all  the copies. 

A: I know, by chance, a German Polish journalist, which was a friend of mine, and 

he saw it on the 
Wa wel

Mój

the priests of the church. The y took it awa y from the market.  

Q: So did it ever hit the market? Did the book ever hit Œ 

A: Parts of it. Part s of it. I would sa y about 1,000 or 2,000 copies, or something l ike 

this. They didn™t know it from the beginni ng. Then the y found out some priest must 

have read it, and is also strong agai nst it, and were some parts against the Catholic 

church, so they said we can™t do thi s. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: We have to protect t he Polish people against this 
Niklas Frank
. 

Q: And tha t™s so ironic. It-It™s just so ironic, because you write in the book of the 

German priest who complains about the Polish clergy.

childhood, your early years, which coincided with the war years, when you were 
having your very first i mpressions, your very first memories, and your father was 

the director Œ the governor general of 
Poland
. I™d like to bri Œ you know, take that 
up now, with the end of the war. You say that one of your most stark memories i s 

when he™s back at your home, near 
Schliersee
, and you break his glasses. Do you 
have any memories of the war endi ng? Do you have ever any memori es of your life 

changing, before the actual end of the war?  
A: We saw all those American and British bombers starti ng from 
Italy
, fl ying over 
the light Œ lake of 
Schli ersee
, to 
Munich
, to have another bombardment of the city, 
and also to 
Nuremberg
, and so, those bi g cities. And then we are looking forward 
that the Americans came. 
Q: You were looki ng forward to this? 

A: Yes. Al so, m y mother, and also my father, the stupid guy, was looking forward 

that the American cam e. There was a Œ

standing there listening to the radio, and s

ing
 that™s it, that™s what I alwa ys 
wanted to have. That now is comi ng. And he thought that this will be a new Œ 

ma ybe
 as Œ thought maybe it™s a new career for me. And Œ 
an

A: Barricades. These bi g trees. But  the Americans sent in front a Caterpillar and he 

threw awa y very easi ly. And we could see it through Œ from the

Scho

Poland
,

as a sign of capitulation, and no fighting.

A: Yes, 1939. 
Hitl er

Poland
. 
Q: And she took i t seri ously? 

A: She took it seri ously, yes, yes.

or something like t his. And because he was absolutely fluent in German, he was in 
the Special Branch for arresting all the 
top guy
s. And he came from the 
[indecipherable]

Tegernsee
. And then he 
arrested 
Hans Frank

It was a Œ 
A: No, no. No, no. 

Q: It was i mmediate. 

A: It was completely different. He was arrest ed on the fourth of Ma y, 1945, in his 

office. And Lieutenant

Lieutenant

entered the room and said, who of you i s 
Hans Frank
? That was Œ 
m y father really have disappointed. 
Q: Insulting 
h im.
 
A: Because he insulted, because he was very proud. The ﬁ
New York Ti mes
ﬂ 
published a list of the most wanted war cri mi nals, and number one was 
Hans 
Frank
. He was very proud about t his. And so he had Œ 
Q: You knew about it i n 
Schliersee
? 

A: You Œ you don™t have Œ it was earlier, when he was st ill in the government 

general, as t he governor general. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And then the ﬁ
New York Ti mes
ﬂ published it. But the thing is that one mont h 

ago, I got an email from a lady from 
America
. 
Monica
 was the first  name. 
Q: This is this year, 2016? 

A: This year. And she wrote me that her father arrested my father. And I wrote back 

to her that t hat™s strange, because I knew exactl y it was Lieutenant 
Stein
, but there 
was another soldier, and a driver, in this open 
Jeep
. And she said, maybe it was the 
other guy was my father. He™s already dead. And then I urged her, please tell me, 

what Œ wha t was happening, what was the remembrance of your Œ t he memory of 

your father? And he said that when they entered this room in this Œ this office room, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

m y father was standing with a pistol at hi s head, pretending that he™s now killing 
hi mself. And 
Monica™s
 father went to this guy, to 
Hans Frank
, said, no, no. We 
will take care of it. Took awa y the pistol, and arrested him. So I don™t know, I don™t 

have another proof, but  Œ but that™s brand new for me, and I told it  the other family 

of mine, and two of them, two nephews, sons of my brot her 
Mikey
, they thought as 
far as they know, it could be possi ble. Because m y father had a golden pistol, which 

was made from the Jews in 
Kraków
, by force. And Œ but  I interviewed for m y 
book, this 
Helena
(ph), the last love of m y father. 
Q: The secretary. 

A: The secretary. And she told me about t his golden pistol. And I asked her, Mrs. 

Winter 
Œ she was married then 
[indecipherable]
 
n ame,
 family name 
Winter
. Mrs. 
Winter
, why didn™t he commit suicide? And she smiled at me and sai d, 
Niklas
, 
therefore he was too much of a coward. And so I think that the new st ory of 
Monica™s 
father mi ght not fit in, in that wa Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because I think 
Hel ena
 would have told me. 
Q: Now where was 
Lilly
? Was she out of the picture?  
A: No, she was still there. She was living in 
Pateiving

kilometers away, and my father very often was with her.

he was expecting someone. 
Q: Ah.

general.

uld acknowledge hi s fight, and 
[indec

Hi mmler
 had a Œ a representative in the government general, a kru Œ

Q: Mr. 
Kruger
(ph). Tell me a little bit about how your father™s duties were 

delineated, and how the 
SS
 under 
Himmler 
was delineated, and what were the y 

supposed to be doi ng, and what act ually the y were doing. 

A: As a Œ 

Q: As their duties. 
A: Original ly, my father was the chief of the civil admini stration. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But the civil admini stration also was everyt hing, was also the police. But on t he 

other hand, as every di ctator does it, 
impera

partint

e 
divided the responsibilities, and he gave the responsibility for the poli ce, and for the 

SS
 camps and for the extermination camps to 
Hi mmler

H itler 
divided, yes.

A: 
Hitler 
divide. He was a dictator. And m y father wanted always that 
Hi mmler
 Œ 
that he was in state as a first position, as a deput y of 
Hitler
. And also Mr. 
Kruger
(ph) should be his servant. And he was alwa ys keen to prove that he is i n 

power of everything, al so of the 
SS
, which was Œ thinking in his brain was a big 

mistake, you know. Later on, during the trial, he alwa ys said it was 
Hi mmler
, i t 
was only 
Hi mmler
. But was rubbi sh. Because without the civil administration, 
hipler 
Œ 
h
im
 Œ Hi mml er 
couldn™t have run the exterminat ion camps. It was always 
with the help of the civil administ ration. To get the Jews all toget her i n th Œ in the 

ghettos, and all thi s kind of stuff, it was always 
together withthe civil  

administration. 

Q: Oka y, okay. So your father kept this diary, what Œ is it 
diensbuch
(ph), which is 
sort of like Œ 
A: 
Dienstag buch
. 
Q: 
Dienstag buch
. Was this something t hat he would have submitted to hi Œ to 

Hitler
, or t o 
Berlin
 for them to see, or was thi s just his notes to himself? 
A: It wasn™t his notes, he had two stenographers, who always had to write down all 

his speeches, every session of his government, everything. Where he i s, what he i s 

delivering on speeches. The y were alwa ys around him.

A: No, no, it™s Œ 

Q: It™s printed. 

A: Alwa ys was Œ no, he never had any handwriting in this.  
Q: Now in your book you mention that the Œ 
in
 the last da ys, he was doing some 
falsification. 

A: He tried, together with 
Helena
(ph) 
Wi nter
, because the last one wasn™t printed, 
so they could change some pages. 

Q: So it wasn™t much that he was able to change. 

A: No. The other were really printed volumes. 
Q: So in other words, t his is Œ thi s is proof of what he did during the time he Œ 
A: Exactly. 
Q: And he hands this over when he™s arrested. 

A: Yes, voluntarily. And he told one of the psychiatrists who had access to the 

prisoners i n 
Nuremberg
, and Œ 
al
l my relat ives,everybody urged me todestroythis

Hans Frank
, who 
handed over all the proofs against him. And he really was right. 
Q: Did you ever read any part of those diaries? 

A: Oh, yes. Some parts I can know by heart . For instance, when he was traveling, 

after we invaded 
Soviet Union
 Œ 
Galici a
 was the capital of 
Lemberg
, or 
Lviv
, or 
Lwow
, was ki Œ came to the governor general, and one year after this invasion he 
came to the city of 
Lemberg
, addressing about 300 German administration people, 

and the y had Œ I just came through this ol d Jewish nest, by the wa y. I didn™t see 

anybody of those flat footed Indians. What have you done with them? Had you ever 

Œ had you ever done something evil to them? And the protocol i s wri ting great 

hilarity. That was Œ 

Q: Can you say this to German to Œ in German to me? How he said i t in German, if 
you remember it?  

A: He said in German: 
[speaks German] 
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So everybody knew what was going on wit h the Jews. 

Q: Oka y. So he was bei ng funny. Are there other parts of these diaries that remain 

in your memory?
 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
75
 
A: Yes. Whatever happens after the war, ma ybe you can make mincemeat out of the 
Polish or Ukrainians, or whatever i s running around here. Well-
educated man my 

father was, pla ying wonderfully pi ano, knowing 
Sha kespea re
 by heart, and our 
German most important poet, 
Goethe
. And he was sa ying sentences l ike this. 

Q: Is it through these pages that you got to know hi m? 
A: No, I knew hi m before, through all the documents I had. But the diary always 
was with me. 

Q: And what other kinds of documents did you have, in order to Œ  

A: A lot of letters he wrote. Because my mother alwa ys kept them. Also, very nice 

letters in early ti mes of their marriage, and t hen very ugly ones. And t he most ugly 
ones is that he wanted Œ he really terribly wanted the divorce. And knowing what 

was going on in his country, the mass murdering of Jews, he wrote t o m y mother, I 
will go into the dark. I see mountai ns of corpses. Don™t follow me. Please give me 
free, and sta y out of it, and give me the divorce, and 
[indecipherable]
 not written 

down, said I can marry 
Lilly
. So he took the Holocaust as a trick to get the divorce. 
Nice guy. He gave a shit about the Jews and al l the others. Like my m other. My 

mother has a lot of f-friends in the Œ with the Jewish agent s, it™s called 
J üd

Agenten
, who had all these dealings with furs, and Œ 

Q: You™re talking before the war.

A: Yes, but yeah, but she met them again, and when she was entering the Œ the 
ghetto, the 
Kraków  
ghetto, and the 
Warsaw
ghetto, and looking for furs and other 
precious thi ngs, she must have seen some of them again. And there™s a scene which 

I wrote in m y other book against m y mother. There was a Œ a Jewi sh agent of hers, 

which Œ whom she had really very good business. 
Q: So this is a prewar rel-relationship. It started in prewar? 
A: Yes, yes. And Œ but then it was before 
America
 entered the war, al l the German 

Jews tried t o get the visa out for the 
United States
, and other countries. And he was 

standing in this row, and suddenly he saw my mother wal king by with two 

girlfriends of her, and he went to her and sa ying, I am your old agent, Mrs. 

Reichsmi nister
. I am 
Flombom
(ph). I terribl y need a visa, could you please help 
me? And my mother answered to hi m, that ™s strange. My husband tol d me there are 
no difficulties. You wil l get your visa, I am sure of. I also got my passport for 
diplomats. So I would say, 70 to 30, you 
will get you
r vi sa. 
See,
 I know of one of 
the girlfriends who accompanied her. He didn™t show up after the war, though
. They 

must have killed hi m, t he Germans, m y father. But after the war, the 
Scho berho f
 
was plundered. 

Q: Tell us about that. How did that happen? 

A: It was as a Œ in

from

Q: Mm-hm, in the attic. 

A: And then, three weeks later, m y mother ordered Mrs.

from her visits in t he 
K raków 
ghetto. And how™s the Jewish humor? They 
addressed her still Frau Minister. And m y mother said to them, I have this, you can 

get it. But I need flour, butter, meat , to nourish m y children. And during the night 

there come an old car with all thi s stuff. And the y made a fortune, and we don™t 

have to starve any more. That was m y mother. 
Q:Oh m y goodness.
 
A: My mother, on the other hand, was, I thi nk the only person I met i n m y la Œ life, 

who was li ving strictly to reality. When the Third Reich and her luxury was over
, 

she acknowledged i t i mmediately. It™s over now. It™s over. She never glorified in 

front of me, the Thi rd Reich, the powerful living she had. All these servants, all this 

kind of stuff. She never glorified it. Now, she was poor again, like in the beginni ng 

of her life, and now she had to nourish five stupid children. And she did it. She did 
it. So she died worn out in the age of 62.  
Q: What year?
 
A: Fifty-nine, on m y birthda y. We had anot her interview and Œ thi s morning, where 

I answered t his question for 
yo u
.  
Q: That™s ri ght, you di d. 

A: 
It must n™thave been you.
  

Q: That was the one before, rather than Œ we™l l talk about that later.

A: Oka y. 
Q: But I want to go back to things that you just  mentioned right now, about her 

being in the ghettos and doing dealings. I don™t think we talked about that in the 

morning.  

A: I don™t know much more about it. I know my Œ 
my own
 
[indecipherable]
 and I 
knew by the friends, for instance by
 Tante Margot
(ph), and all the other, said that 
very often was in the ghettos. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Alwa ys on Œ and you have to i magine, the Jewish people were the last 

[indecipherable]
 and t he last precious things. And if the wife of the governor 

general shows up, t he y had the desperate hope that if they sell her, for a cheap price, 

ma ybe she will do something that the y can survive. My mother didn™t  do nothing 
about it. 
Q: So she just took advantage of her ability to Œ 

A:Yes, yes, yes.
 

Q: Now, was the 
Schoberho f
 filled with all of these types of items, of paintings, of 
goods Œ 

A: No, that was Œ the painting which my father stole when he left 
Kraków
, for 
instance 
Leonardo da Vinci
, and two 
Rembrandts
, and one 
Ra phael
, and a lot  of

tapestry and jewelry from the Polish kings, and other paintings, a lot of paintings, 
and that was in his littl e house where also his office was. 

Q: So all of that was there? 

A: Yes. It was one of the most precious museums at that ti me, if you look around 

Euro pe
. And 
Œ but this where all the wa Œ 
always 
Œ all of this was handed over t o 
the Americans. And onl y t he 
Raphael
 is missing still nowada ys. I assume that this 

Raphael
 i s hanging in a farmer™s kitchen. 

Q: In 
Germany
?  
A: Yes, in 
Bavari a
.Because m y mother 
Œ I think m y mother stole it. Because it 
was not big, this size. And got some bread and butter and somet hing, some 

chickens. 

Q: So when the Œ when the 
Schoberho f 
was pl undered, it was Œ 
and, by theforced 
laborers, it wasn™t stuff like this t hat the y were finding. 

A: No. 

Q: What were the y actually taking, when the y were doing their pl undering? 

A: There were other precious things, truly also for my mother, and t his kind of stuff. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It was a Œ they found a lot of Œ

Q: Oka y. Okay. So your father is arrested on Ma y 4
th
, ™45, and do you remember the 
end of the war, actually Œ 
A: Well, first, as every G
erman can tel
l you, youngster, t
hen we saw the first 
Negroes. Now it™s a black African American. 

Q: Americans. 
A: But Œ and I thought all the Americans are mil lionaires, and the y t hrow down to 
us children a lot of chocolate, you know. Very nice guys, really ni ce guys. 
Very 

friendly, very friendly. And after the plundering of the 
Scho berho f
, t he Americans 
also put some guards around the 
Scho berho f
.  
Q: Oh, did the y? 

A: But the y also drank all the wine my father has in the cellar. 

Q: Now, at  that point, your sister, your oldest sister is 18 years ol d, 
Norman
 
is 17 
years old, t he y™re already in their upper teens. What were t he y doi ng? Were the y 

still at home, were they off somepl ace else? Were you all together? 

A: 
Sigrid
 was working in a Red C ross hospital in 
Silesi a
 at the t i me, but then she 
was back home. But before, she wrote a very i nteresting l etter to my mother, in a 

very normal tone. That ™s correct?  

Q: Oka y. Yeah. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
82
 
A: Telling her, I am treating here all the wounded German soldiers, and they are all 
very much afraid if 
Germany
 is losing the war. That was in the spring of 1945. 
Q: Oh m y. 

A: Because, they sa y to my sister 
Sigrid
, what we have done to the Jews, they will 
never forgive us. So far that the Germans are telling you, nobody knew anything. 
When it was Œ 
Sigrid
 wrote it in a kind of, we know this. So it  was l ike Œ and 
imagine, dear Mother, I couldn™t have believed it. the y sa y this. No. Quite normal. 

Wha
t we have done to the Jews, so the y will kill us now. 
Q: When we talked before, about your father being arrested, 
about him being 

brought to trial, that he™s in the first row, why is it that you visited him only once, in 

September of ™46?  

A: It was prohibited that Œ you ti Œ can™t visit the defendants. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And it was a ti me when the trial  was finished, before they handed out the 

verdicts, there was suddenly the permissi on, that the fami ly of the defendants, not 

knowing what the resul t of the trial will be for them, the y could vi sit for once, thei r 

fathers. 

Q: Oka y. What can you tell me about that  visi t? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
83
 
A: That visit was t he last disappoint ment concerning m y father. I was sitting on the 
lap of my mother. He was sitting behind the window, with a small 
gitter
, that we 

could understand each other. And I was sitting there, and m y father laughed Œ 

Q: Screen, mm-hm. 

A: Œ and said to me, hi 
Niki
(ph), nice to see you. Soon we will celebrate a happy 
Christ mas in 
Schoberhof
. And I said to m ysel f, why is he lying? Why is he lying? 
He knows that he i s going to be hanged. Because I knew t hat. 

Q: Yeah, you told us earlier that there was di Œ it was, by then, comm on knowledge. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you™re seven years old, and you re Œ and you thi nk this to yourself. 

A: Yeah, it was really disappoint ing. 

Q: Did he have any other words to any of the other children? 
A: The strange thing 
is that m ybrother 
Michael
 never told anybody what our father 
told him. Also, not to his children. That™s really strange. Now he™s dead, a long t ime 
ago. And t o 
Norman
, he was alone, without our mother, because he was grownup, 
nearly. And to 
Norman 
he said
, I™m 
Œ 
Ican™t leave youanyt hing but the manuscript 

which I wrote in the pri son. And remember al ways, I am a man of law, I™m not a 

poet, so maybe it™s not all Œ and then I will give you one advice. Please build up 

here something.

Interview with Niklas Frank

Q: Bil Œ build up a defense. 
A: A defense here. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And made this 
[hand across throat motion]
. And this Œ wel l, I st ruggled wit h 

m y 
brother about t his command, i s that wise for a life? 
Q: What does it mean? 

A: Don™t talk too much. Don™t talk too much. Because he was sent enced to death 

because of what he was talking in the first-hand. And I al wa ys say, that was an 

advice of m y father to be a coward. A
nd m y brother 
Norman
 said no, it was just to 
be silent. And I was silent, and I said, so 
you was
 a coward, huh? As your father 
said to you you should be. 

Q: So that was Œ t hat was a point of contention between you and bra Œ 
and your 
brother 
Norman
. 
A: Yeah. And then he wrote in his last let ter t o m y brother 
Norman
, this is 
[indecipherable]
 we have to die, in this war. We will follow millions of our 
soldiers, of our brave soldiers, who were Œ already has been killed in this war. And 
what true ar Œ shoul d I do with the rest of m y l ife, for instance? Should I be dealt i n 

revenge from i mmi grants, traitors? So I prefer to be dead. So the i mmi grants were Œ 

were these really, those guys like 
Willy
 
Brandt
, our chancellor then, who said, we

can™t fight this dictatorship, but we don™t want  to do anything wi th it, and so the y 
emi grate. So the y wa Œ they were the brave ones, and the Œ the really good ones. So 

he Œ he hadn't got any i dea, and he never acknowledged, after a year of trial, where 

the Americans, the English and the French, and the Russian have shown them a l ot 

of documents, even a movie about 
Auschwitz
. What kind of horrible cri mes thi s 
bunch of cri minals has committed? And then he is writing something like this. And 
he wrote to his lawyer, Mr. 
Zeidel
(ph), and also to our mother, please make sure 
that the future will see the true 
Frank
. I was never a cri minal. And my mother la Œ 
something is like Œ 
he neveracknowledged anyt hing.
 
Q: And do you remember how your mother reacted to it? 

A: No. 
[indecipherabl e]
 But there was this 18
th
 of April in 1946, he was on the 
stand, trial. And he was asked by Mr. 
Zeidel
(ph), his defendant Œ his l awyer Œ 
Q: Lawyer. 

A: Œ and asked hi m, have you ever had something to do with the exti nguishing of 

Jews Œ exterminati on of Jews? And my father, after a short silence, he said yes. I 

never ordered to build up a concent ration cam p, but if I now look back what we 

have done, and m y own diary is a witness against me. What we have said, what we 

have done, I only have to acknowledge thi s guilt. A thousand years will pass 

without taking away this guilt from the German people. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
86
 
Q: Your father said this? 
A: Yes. Now I ask you, when I am asked from m y lawyer, have you personally 

something to do with the extermination camps, why I suddenly distri bute m y guilt 

on 80 million other German shoulders? And I j ust have finished a book from a 

German defense lawye r, and all the defense lawyers were sitting t here, as he 
remembered, and sa ying, what is t his 
Frank
 doing? At first he admitted his 
personal guilt, and suddenly it™s vanished about 80 milli on shoulders. So this was 

also, the lead for the German people, how to react. We never acknowledged our 

guilt. We have built a lot of monuments, and we are a beautiful example for the 

other world, what we have done with our past, and how Œ how great we were in 

acknowledge Œ 
it™s just 
the surface. The Germ an people, still I am very much afraid 
of. 
Q: Why?
 
A: The y never acknowl edged our cri mes, never. It was just a Œ we have to do this 
because the world is looking for that the Germans have to do somethi ng. So we 

built some monuments, and the German histori ans did a very good job. There is no 

German cri me which was not thoroughly researched and written down. Everybody 

can read it, but also, if you read it as a normal German, you will never acknowledge 

this, really. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
87
 
Q: Why?
 
A: Because the Germans have a lock Œ a lack Œ 
a lack 
of empathy. The Germans 
can™t put themselves in the soul, or in the situation, let™s sa y, of a Jewish mother 

who has t wo children, who is forced by German soldiers or German 

[indecipherable]
 police, into a catt le car, is driven through days and nights wit hout 
any food or water, embracing the little chil drens, and then thrown out of the cattle 
car, to the ramp of 
Auschwitz
, for instance, and then the y took awa y the two 

children. They can™t do this. And I am reading in schools or somewhere, I alwa ys 

said, have you ever tried to do thi s? Every German knows what really had 

happened, what we have done. Have you ever put yourself in the situation like this? 

And the y al l went no. They don™t do that, they can™t do it. That™s the special thi ng 

about the Germans. 
Q: But in this, I Œ this takes our st ory awa y from your life, and the postwar 
development of it, but we™re talking now about German society. And this is a very 

di m view of Germans, as a people. And it doesn™t sound Œ how shall I say it? I™d 

need Œ I need Œ 

A: Honestly. 

Q: Œ to have more proof. I need to have more sense of how do you Œ how can you 

make such an overall, arching statement that Germans have no empat hy? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
88
 
A: No, I Œ I live in Œ within m y German peopl e, I know them. Also, for instance, 
was our chancellor, Mrs. 
Merkel
 did this open up for the refugees 
[indecipherable]
  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Around the world they applauded her. So that, that™s a great thing. And I also 

was suddenly proud. B ut now, we do have about 600 Œ was last year about 600 
different burning downs of homes for refugees. We have beaten up people, we have 
even killings. So, you have to see the German people like a dark, a dark ball. And 

on this bal l, let™s say we are 80 millions are this ball. Out of this 80 millions, and I 

make it very positi vely, let™s sa y are 10 million Germans who are on this dark bal l. 

The y are running around. They are really, true democrats. The y are reall y looking 

that we sta y a democracy. But this ball is still very, very i gnorant, and very, very 

against everyt hing was Œ what is hurting t hem in their Œ yeah, in t heir bad 
conscious, I would say.  

Q: Do you feel this insi de yourself? 

A: No, I am one Œ I am one of the 10 millions who are Œ around. 

Q: Let™s turn back. When your father said t hese different things to your siblings, 

and said to 
Norman
 that all I leave is ma ybe t his manuscript, and his piece of 
advice. Was there anything else that he sai d to any of the girls? 

A: No, I don™t know. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
89
 
Q: You don™t know. 
A: The y di dn™t talk about it. 

Q: All right. After you visited him, was t here any discussion at home, about the 

visit?  

A: I don™t remember, but there must have been. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: I asked m y brot her 
Norman
, but 
Œ decades later, and he said, we still had hope. 
Because the visit was before the verdict came out. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Which
 I found out very late, because in m y first book I write t hat it  was after the 

verdict came out. So you can sa y it™s Œ it™s Œ i t™s a mistake, which makes the trut h 

even stronger. I was so sure that he will be hanged, I didn™t need t he verdict, yes? It 
was before the Œ the judge handed out the verdict. I always thought i t was 
afterwards, and then I found out no. 

Q: It was before. 

A: Now I know exactly the date it wa Œ we were on the 17
th
 of September where we 
visited hi m. And t he verdicts came out on t he first of October. The guilt y and non-

guilty was set on t he 30
th
 of September. 
Q: So was Œ it was after your visit. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
90
 
A: But then was a deat h penalty, or 20 years, or life imprisonment, came on the first 
of October. 

Q: Did you ever shed any tears about your father? 

A: No. 

Q: Did you ever shed any tears Œ 
A: But the strange thing was when I was sitting together with 
Philip
pe Sa nds
, 
international lawyer who made a fil m also about me. I was sitti ng in a cell, like the 
same in which 
Hans Frank
 was Œ was sitting during the trial in 
Nuremberg
. Not 
exactly the same measurement. But when m y Œ when Colonel 
Andrews 
come 
Œ 

came with t he Œ wit h the guards, to get him to the gallows. And t he ni ght was the 

16
th
 of October, 1946, t hey opened the door and m y father was kneeli ng. And the y 
had to Œ Father 
O™Connor
 
accompanied 
Andrews
 and the guards. Said to him, 
Father, my mother used to give me the cross on m y forehead before I went to school 

every morning. Please do this, as well. And when I was telling this 
Philip
pe
 i nside 
the cell, I suddenly was very near to my father, and the first time I think I really had 

some pity for hi m. Suddenly I understand that ™s the action of a ham actor. And 
suddenly, in this cell, I got the idea ma ybe i t wasn™t an ham actors ar Œ kind of 

thing. But he has this terrible, terrible urging wish to be young again, t o have not 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

co
mmitted any cri mes, and to be a i nnocent  human being again. And at this 
moment, I felt somethi ng of emotion for hi m, I would sa y. 
Q: And that™s so many decades later. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: That™s j ust very recently. 
A: Yeah, because you have alwa ys pictured 
of
 his victi ms, in the brain. 
Q: Tell me how life progressed for your family after that. What happened with your 
mother, how did she Œ 

A: My mother published the book of m y father, it was at first published by a 

publishing company, but it was a t otal flop. And then she took over, founded her 

own publi shing company, 
Eine Falak
(ph), 
Brigitte Frank
. And at first she 
addressed every Cathol ic priest. She printed the book Œ I will never forget it, for 4 
mark, 50 
fennig
, and sold it for about 19 marks, 50 
fennig
, and she never paid a 
penny of taxes. So, she made quite a fortune, I would sa y. About 200 Œ 250,000 
deutschmark, or German marks. 

Q: That™s a lot of money then. 

A: So she la Œ she Œ she suddenly had agai n, a fur, and was sitting in her beloved 

Hotel
 Carlton
 in 
Muni ch
, having tea in the afternoon. After the Catholic priests, 
there came the Protestant pastors. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
92
 
Q: Why 
Œ 
A: Then there come the industries. She al ways addressed them personall y, and 
always was telling them we were Œ in the meanti me we were grownups, but in the Œ 

she wa Œ or nearly grownups, 
Mi key
 
and me wereabout 15 
- 16 years old. And she 
wrote, my l ittle chi ldren, the y are starving and so on. Please 
buy this copy,and you 
will prolong our life. And so she did it, and the director of 
[indeci pherable] 
for 
instance, he i mmedi ately sent, as a gift, one car to us. So m y mother i mmediately 

made up a company for renting a car. 

Q: No, really? 

A: Yes. She was really brilliant. And I Œ I really, as you can see, how I tell you t his, 

I have a different approach to m y mother, and I found out, which I™ve never written, 

because my books were finished, I found a letter which I didn™t reall y see before. In 
this letter t o a friend, she wrote, when I remember the times gone by, we really were 
merciless. And that  is, at least, a very honest acknowledgment also, what she has 

done.  

Q: It sounds like you were looking, throughout  your whol e life, for some kind of 

self -reflection of that kind. 
A: Yes, because they knew everything, but you have to i magine t hat this 
Wawel
, 

this government general, and especially the 
Wawel
, was like a ki ng™s yacht. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016

Everybody knows each other. The 
SS
 was completely integrated. Al so this Mr. 
Kruger
 was also si tting on the 
Wawel
. So there were a lot of friendships in 
between, and sexual relationship with all t he secretaries and so on. So everybody 

knows everything about the extermination of the Jews, how it works i n the 
Kraków 

ghetto, how it works then, in the concentrati on camp of 
Plaszów Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, 
Plaszów
. 
A: Œ and all  this ki nd was quite Œ also, my mot her knew everything exactly.  

Q: And thi s letter, which you found after you published your book, which was in 

2005, is the first ti me you see any kind of acknowledgement, reflection from her. 

A: Yes, written down, written down. 

Q: Written down.
 

A: Ma ybe, I don™t know to whom, ma ybe she has told it to some Œ 
T ante 
Margot
(ph), 
Tante Marta
(ph), or her other friends. Really, she had a lot of Œ of 
good girlfriends. 

Q: You do mention that she herself was arrested. Why was that? 

A: It was Minister 
Lauretz
(ph) of 
Bavaria
 government in 1947. He was an ardent 
fighter against Nati onal  
[indecipherable]
. And so he thought al so the wives are 
responsible . So, everybody who was living on Œ in the 
Bavaria
 
state, was

imprisoned , in 
Aug sburg
. Also my mother, al so Mrs. 
G oering
, and Mrs. 
Fink
(ph), 
and Mrs. 
Foch
(ph), I think. 
Q: And did she tal k about what her situati on was like that? 
A: She was great. I visi ted her. She was laughi ng, she was smoking, she was brown 

by sun, brown faced. And when she came back she said it was t he most wonderful 
holiday I had. She was very pragmatic. And she loved it t here, wit hout the stupid 
children. But there was no 
Hilde
(ph) around any more. She had t o deal with us after 

the war.  

Q: So, what happened t o 
Hilde
(ph)? She couldn™t Œ 

A: She was Œ she Œ she married and had one son. Her husband comm itted suicide, 
and after Œ and when Œ but then also, she has died, also, her son committed suicide. 

All that had nothing to do with the Nazi ti me. 
Q: No, no. When did you start really investigating, and reading? 
A: It was al ways, by the way, when I was 22 Œ when I met my wife first, I was 22 

years old, and at first, i f you, after the first kisses, you are telling your biography. 

So I was telling her th Œ mine, and telling her, once upon a ti me, I wi ll write about 
m y father. I forgot about it, that I have sai d this. And I was nearly 50, when I di d it, 

really. I wanted, first subconscious and then full Œ in full consci ous, I said, I don™t 

want that m y parent s ruin m y life. That™s m y life, by God™s plan, or by coincidence,

I was born into thi s family, so I will have m y own life as 
Niklas Frank
, and not as 
the son of Œ of those two. 

Q: Your di scussions wi th your siblings, did they take place over a course of many 

years?
 

A: Yes. Well, alwa ys we were together. Imm ediately we were in discussion about 
our parents. It was always the same. 
Q: And can you tel l us about what was discussed? 

A: It was always di scussed, the mai n topic was, was he innocent, or was he guilty? I 

had the documents, they had nothing. They had just her l ove Œ their l ove. I had no 

love, but I had the documents.  

Q: And the y didn™t have any desire to read 
any ofthose documents?
 
A: The y have read it. I know from the chil dren of 
Michael
, for instance, who was 
an ardent defender of t he innocence of our father, he read t his Œ 
t wo German 

scientists gave out the shortcut of the ™42 volumes of this 
Dienstag buch
. It was 

that size. And he read i t and Œ duri ng the holiday. And hi s sons have seen him 

sitting all days long, very, very sad, at the beach, reading this. B ut he never opened 

up to say what I have j ust said. It™s so unbelievable. He must have read the s
ame 

thing that I quoted before. The y are in there. But he was alwa ys defending hi m. 

Q: So Œ

The y were telling them, laughing about it, and I was very interested i n Œ to hear all 

this, what I don™t know because I was the youngest one. It was al ways very funny 

when we were toget her. Always Œ also when we are struggling against each other, 

we never lost our Œ all right, we™ll sa y we never lost our l ove. 
Q: Well, that was my question, is what ki nd of relations you had with each other 
afterwards? 

A: Great. Very good, very good. And when my book came out, my brother 
Michael
 
attacked me in publi c, heavily, that I am a liar and nothing is true what I have 

written, and all this kind of stuff. But we decided, you can do this, I™ll do Œ 
go my 

way, and we have nice children, so we don™t let destroy our personal relationship. 

And that was a good idea. 
Q: And what about  Œ 
A: And it worked. 

Q: And what about  Œ you said 
Bri gitte
, your sister, 
Gitty

A: 
Gitty

A: But then she Œ you don™t have t o forget, we all had a profession, so we were not 
every weekend toget her. It was two or three times in a year. 

Q: But she took her own lif
e.
 
A: She took her own life, yes. 

Q: And why? 
A: She had cancer, but as the doctors told me i s she could have survived about five, 
six, seven years. But she has written in her diary when she was 16 years old, I don™t 

want to became older t han 
Fatti
(ph) Œ our fat her. And this was a self-fulfilling 

promise. 

Q: Prophec y. 

A: Which she did. 

Q: Did she have children? 
A: And she did it in an awful, very awful manner. She had from different Œ two 
different husbands, two sons. And with Œ from the second husband, her son, he was 

eight years old when she committed suicide, and she did it the following way. She 

took this eight year old boy into her bed in the evening. Told hi m, now it™s nice day, 

let™s sleep t ogether. So he slept during the night, and when he woke up, h
is mother 

was lying beside hi m, dead. Because she com mitted wit h lot of tablets and alcohol,

and what Œ what a gruesome, what  Œ unbelievable for this poor child. I don™t 
understand.  

Q: Did Œ did this burden, was it vi sited on your children, the other generation, the 

children of your siblings? 

A: I don™t know the word burden. 
Q: All right. 
A: If you acknowledge something, you Œ 
you 
Œ mostly you are like me. When I 
think of my father, when I think of the vict i ms, and when I think of what he could 

have done to Œ to leave his job Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and to go int o the inner immi gration, that™s for Œ I™m alwa ys furi ous about hi m. 

Still furious. Why has he done it? But it™s not a burden. 
Q: Then ma ybe I™m choosing the wrong word, but nevert heless, i t™s an influence. 
A: For sure it™s an influence.  

Q: It™s Œ it was an influence, and it was somet hing that became part of your life. 

A: I never Œ  I never had a father who was a carpenter, or the engineer, or a teacher. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was al ways this bl oody 
Hans Frank
.  
Q: And so my question still sta ys. Was the third generation affected by who he was?

A: For sure. The best way I did for m y daughter, which she told i n an i nterview Œ 
I 
was really surprised Œ she said that m y father build around me, a wall, because of 

what he has written, and what he has done. But he doesn™t  mean it  the wa y he bui ld 

up a wall that I don™t know anything. On the other hand, that I can live secured. I 

know everything, what my father found out about m y grandfather, so I Œ 
I can lead 
m y own life, my happy life. 
Q: That™s a huge thing. 

A: I was very satisfied when I heard this. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She never said i t to me. 

Q: Yeah. But it™s a huge thing for a child to feel that. 

A: Well, she said it when she was grown up. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Not as a child. 

Q: Can we cut just for a second 
[break] 

A: Action! 

Q: Action. So, wi th your other Œ with your ot her siblings, did you have any Œ 
once 

your ol Œ eldest si ster l eft for
 South Africa
, did you have contact wit h her?

A: I visit her once when I worked in 
South Africa
. She was living in 
J o ha nnesburg
, and she knew m y book, i t was published in the meantime. She al Œ 
also had read it, but  she said only somethi ng li ke, so you have something written, 

haven™t you? Not more. 

Q: So she didn™t comment on it. 
A: But Œ but I Œ I know that she was very furious about it, like m y brother 
Norman
, 
by the wa y, he also was very furious about the book. 
Q: Why?
 
A: Because of this advi ce of our father Œ 

Q: To stay silent. 

A: Œ he never wanted t o be a Œ 
a 
Œ in publ ic. And so he also wanted never to be i n 

public, a discussion about what hi s father has done. That was the mai n reason. 
Q: And thi s was quite public. This was quite public. 
A: It was, yes. 

Q: And di Œ 

A: And it was the first book in 
Germany
, and like, was al so Œ it Œ it sounds a lit tle 
bit vain, but it was the only book in German literature of Œ no, not literature, in 

Germany
 from an heir of some top Nazi, who attacked his father. And with very 
foul language. That was a significant thing.

[indecipherable]
 that i s, did 
yo
u think about i t consciously 
when you were writ ing it, that I want this style, or was thi s Œ 
A: It was about 12 weeks for m y Œ so, as holidays. So Œ and I wrote it  down wit hin 

12 weeks. 

Q: And Œ and this had been after you had been looking at the documents, and 
reading about this Œ 
A: I had nearly everyt hing together, but it never will end, I Œ in t he meanti me, I 

have a lot of  more documents. 
Q: Around the same time, 
Peter 
Si chro v sky
 
wrote a book, called ﬁ
Schuldig

.ﬂ Do you know any of the children who he 
interviewed for that book? 

A: 
Peter Sichrovsky
 was a friend of mine, and I asked him, and it™s all invented. 
Q: Really? 

A: It™s all invented. I would say so. It™s all invented. It™s t oo Œ too perfect, and never 

anybody of those peopl e showed up, never. And there™s also another proof that 

everything was invented. I know hi m. Lat er on he wa Œ

true. 

A: Everythi ng was invented. I Œ I t old hi m personally, I was like, 
Peter

will never publish it. 
[indeciphera ble]
 i nvent ed it. But Œ but he didn™t sa y no, I 
remember, he didn™t  say no. Just laughed it away. 
Q: Mm-hm. So this is Œ so, in other words, this is your suppositi on, rat her than 
having actual proof, that he did Œ 
A: Yes, yes, no, no, you would never admit Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was a bestsell er, and it also was transcript into a Œ for theater, and so, but I am 

right, I know this. 

Q: Did other children of other Nazis get in touch with you after your book was 
published?  
A: Yes. In a negative way. The son of 
Hess
, for instance, we were invited to a tal k 

session for the Bavarian Broadcast ing System, and when he Œ and Œ and he said, 

oka y, I will  come. And then he heard that I Œ also I will show up, and he 

immediately canceled his appearance. And there was American author, 
G

Posner
, who also, by t he wa y, files closed about the kill ing of 
Kennedy

wrote a book also, about the descendants of the bigshot Nazis, and he was standi ng

better if you call her first. I terribly need an int erview with her for m y book, it 

would be great, you know. And I said okay, gi ve me the number, and I dialed, and 

said Œ somebody got to the phone saying 
Göring
. And I said hell o, Mrs. 
Göring
. 
My name i s 
Niklas Frank

G

 Œ and then she interrupted 
me, said, one moment, one moment. Are you t he one who was Œ has written thi s 

unbelievabl e ugly book about his father? And I said yes, and bang. 

Q: There went the telephone. 

A: Was a Œ was 
[indeci pherable]
 that. And the son of 
Bormann
, who was a priest, 
but later he wrote all  the book about his father, is not a pri est any more. And ye Œ 

wo Œ has al so written a book, and another journalist, Mr. 
Liebe

hi m, and i n this intervi ew for his book, he sai d he would like to Œ to Œ to get 

together Œ t o come t ogether with 
Niklas Frank

Stern
ﬂ magazine, the chief 
editor told me 
[indecipherable]
 that™s a good story, let™s do it, and you talk to each 

other, and s o Œ and then they arranged it. But in the meanti me, Mr. 
Bormann
 

junior, whose first name also is 
Martin
, Mr. 
Bormann
 has read ﬁ
The Father
,ﬂ and 
didn™t want  to have to do anything with me. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
104
 
Q: Was there Œ why do you think that™s t he case? Because you were so vociferous, 
so unrelenti ng about your father? Were there Œ  and what Œ  were there reasons that  

were ever gi ven to you? 

A: 
Marty Bormann
, for instance, yes, he Œ had a lot of lessons in schools, yes? 

And he always used to have a picture with him, of his father. And he said to the 
auditorium, I know my father was a cri minal, but I also know that he was a most  
wonderful father. And i f you say t his in 
Germany
, immediately, the site of the 
cri mes which your father has committed, is gone, and in t he German brains, is still 

alive, a wonderful father. What about those bloody cri mes, they are gone. But the 

wonderful father. This 
Peter Sichrovsky
 you mentioned before, he is Jewish. He 
was personally saved by an 
SS
 officer, out of a cattle car, as far as I know, yes. He 
was blue e yed and blonde hair, yes? And I t old it, in a big auditori um, only once, 
that there also was an 
SS
 man who, for instance, saved a Jewish boy, was looking 
like an Aryan boy, blue eyes, blonde hair. And you can see it, as well, about 300 
people in this, the y all leaned back, very happy suddenly. We haven™t done anything 

bad, we have saved the little boy. So the complete cri mes, were gone. So I will Œ 

I™ve never done this again. 

Q: But this is what 
Norman
 also says. I mean, in the book that you write about your 
brother, on the title of it is that I know he™s a criminal, I™m Œ 
I™m paraphrasing 
Œ  

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

105
 
A: I™m stil l love him. 
Q: Œ but I loved hi m. That sounds to me like a very genuine perspecti ve. 

A: Yeah, but it™s Œ it™s the same logic, like I just told you about t his Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ 
Peter Sichrovsky
, and
 
about the 
Œ  
Q: 
Bormann
. 
A: Pardon?  

Q: About 
Martin Bormann
, explaining this i n Œ in classrooms. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But also 
Peter Sichrovsky 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that I™m telling about his being saved by an 
SS
 
man.
 This l ove is , i mmediately, 
whatever my father has said or done, it™s gone. It™s still t he love. Therefore, he 
becameanalcoholic, and my brot herwas drinking milk.If you don™t acknowledge 

the truth Œ I tell you how m y mot her was. When the death Œ when the sentences 

were delivered from the judges, it was broadcasted lively, yes? My mother has 

written down with her pencil, all the names, 
Göring
, 
Ribbentro p
, 
Funk
, 
Keitel
, 
Seyss
-
Inqua rt
, 
Howe
, all the names. We™re si tting in front of the radio with a

pencil, and who was sentenced to death, she made a cross. By 20 years, 20 years;  
life, 
L
, and so on. And when it came to her husband, 
Hans Frank
, getting the death 
penalty, she made, i n al l coolness, a cross. Great. That™s acknowledged. That™s 

acknowledgement of what is reality. Therefore, I love m y mother. She was not 

pretending t hat, oh, thi s innocent guy. She knew exactly t hat he has deserved it. 
Q: So, how come her children didn™t? I mean, a mother can influence a Œ 
A: It™s a Œ i t™s a bi g taboo around t he worl d. You should honor your parents, and 

love them, whatever they have done.  

Q: So, you mean, the 10 commandments. 

A: I acknowledge this t aboo. Yes, somethi ng l ike this. But I can™t  do it. It™s for sure 

and Œ the y Œ they didn™t Œ they di dn™t run around the table, and Œ and bury it there. 

So it was my advantage, and the y had the advantage that the y have very lovely 
memories of our father. So you have Œ the y have the bigger Œ the bigger struggle, if 
they would have succeeded. Their struggli ng would have been much stronger than 

mine. I coul dn™t stand t his guy, but the y really have loved him. He was very funny, 

m y father, he was very funny. He was very Bavarian style, and if he was at home, 

and he was in good mood. So the y had a heavy task
,and m y brother 
Norman
, he 
Œ 
he tried it lifelong. But he was open, at least, t o m y documents. And we were sitt ing 

together, there was a lot of speeches of m y fat her still recorded. You can hear him, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
107
 
yes? And we were sitti ng and heari ng them, my brother was so furi ous like I was. 
H-H
e 
Œ he couldn™t stand this crap what m y father was speaking. 

Q: So all Œ  of all of the children, he was wi th you on that. He was somebody who 

could sa y yes, this isn™t  Œ 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Œ this is no good, this is Œ but you™ve done something else, is t hat you™ve made it 
all public. That is, your relationshi p to hi m, your relationship to your mother, you 

relation Œ 

A: No, it was so Œ I don™t know. I didn™t ment ion m y first book because bi Œ 

Gitty
(ph) was dead already. All the other were still alive.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: I never mentioned a sibling of mine. Never. Because they are not t he address. So 
as ever Œ I never mention it. I wrote it as if I was only child of them. That™s Œ it™s an 
etiquette thi ng. You can™t do this without permi ssion of this guy. So, when I wrote 

m y mother, only 
Norman
 was still alive. And I Œ when I wrote 
Norman
, 
Norman 
was already dead. Before, I would never have done it. 

Q: Oka y. Let me rephrase it then.  

A: In the good English. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
108
 
Q: I™ll try. Nevertheless, you explore, you put to the public, your Œ in German it™s 
[speaks German] 
but your thoughts, your questions, your accusations, your 
critique, your 
Œ 
A: No, that was Œ 

Q: Œ whatever it is, you put that through t he, you know, i n your relati onship wit h 
your father first, then with your mother, and t hen with 
Norman
. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And one Œ in one of the reviews it™s sort of like you Œ you sa y that, oka y, I™ve 

undressed us for the world to see. Somet h Œ that™s a paraphrase, but that™s 

something of what it™s like. 

A: Yes, because what alwa ys dist urbed me very much, that is the silence in 

Germany
. This not acknowledgi ng what we have done. We shouldn™t go around 
with a doggish eyes, always feeling ashamed. Life is much too st rong, live your life. 

But acknowledge it like 
[indec
ipherable]
 football. Acknowledge what we have 
done. We are not personally responsible, but by chance, we are Germ ans. So you 

have to Œ and if you acknowledge this, then will happen t he second t hing. You 

become very, very infuriated whenever you hear again something about the cri mes 

we have committed, yes? Like I told you before, looking at children Œ 
faces of 

Jewish children who were forced to go to sta y, th-there™s a Œ every German, because 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
109
 
of our sc-school system, they learn a lot about the Holocaust, so 
every German has 
pictures in his mind. So that™s the second thing, you don™t Œ will be ashamed, but Œ 

and that would be also, wrong way, but bef Œ become furious, and get a little bit 

more civil courage. The more you know about  the cowardi ce of your parents and 

grandparent s, the more you will find out what I found out, a thousand times with 
m yself. Ah, 
Niki
(ph), now you are becoming a coward. Don™t do t his like your 
father. Be strong. And i t™s not committing a cri me, it™s just a da y i n the ﬁ
Stern
ﬂ 
magazine, and all this kind of stuff. You can get yourself more Œ  yeah, more civi l 

courage, and sta ying as a Œ as a democrat. 

Q: What do you Œ what  do you hope, or what do you thi nk the contri bution of 

making your life and your relation to mot her, to father, to Œ to 
Norman
, public in 

the books, what do you hope that i t gives t o the audiences, to the publ ic? 
A: To do it  themselves, in their own family. That™s Œ that™s the only reason why I 
did it. We have to talk about it. We have to talk inside the families. I always 

recommend it
 when I am finished with m y Œ I alwa ys read out of the books, and 

then we have always a very lively discussion. And then I am always t elling them, 

look at your home, look at Œ ask your grandparents, and Œ if they are still alive, ask 

them, what™s really Œ what have you experienced, what were you Œ and Œ and if the y 

are strong, they wil l say t o you, my dear grandchild, I was such a coward. I knew 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

exactly that mine Jewish neighbors were thrown away, and I have to confess, I took 
a big, big wonderful painting out of this Jewish family. If this is, that would be 

great. And I have to acknowledge, I have a lot of letters, mails, personal calls, 

which sa y, the first time I started to look i n the history of my family. 

Q: That was my next question, yeah. 
A: And I found out is t hat Œ is for me, really satisfying. Last ti me was Œ m y wife, 
she is not very keen to have telephone calls. And there was a man who was 65 years 

old. And I Œ 
he asked me three monthsbefore,gave mea call.
 Ni kl as Frank
 is a 
very rare name, he-he found me in the telephone book, and told me, I am so 

desperate. I know my father was this and that, but I can™t find anyt hing. He was re Œ 

really a si mple man, I have to admit. And I told hi m what  he has to do, writing t o 

this archive, and thi s archive, alwa ys giving the exact dates of his father, and so on. 
And then he did it, and unfortunately m y wife was on the phone, I was abroad, and 
he was so crazy to t hank me, and t hat it was so wonderful. It™s the first ti me I found 

out what this guy had done. It wasn™t so Œ so really famous. But, he was so happy. 
That was a Œ if I get thi s, it™s really good. 
Q: So to me it sounds li ke that™s Œ you have gotten support. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You have gotten people who have said, thank you for doing i t.

A: But never forget thi s ball, that™s alwa ys there Œ up there Œ 
the y are 
Œ there™s one 
who™s aski ng, oh 
Niklas 
is not bad, that™s all. 
Q: But one could sa y t hat about al most any people. One could sa y that about al most 
any 
Œ 
A: Now, I think I will finish this interview, because you can win everyt hing, if you 
compare it with the world. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: No, be serious. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: If you compare i t with the worl d, you have nothing in the end. You can just sa y, 

every human being has an ugly face in it. It  is saying not hing. If you are talking 

about m y l ife Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ and about the jailed Germans, then I am t he biggest chauvini st you can 

imagine. It™s only t he German crimes, because we have done the worst thing in the 

world, and we should know better. If you don™t have civil courage, we will do it  

again. And if you l ook now to 
Germany
, with the refugee problems, we are only a 
good 
[indecipherable]
 democrac y. We have never proved since ™45, after we lost 
the war, that we are reall y a democrac y, that  we have really a civil courage. That is 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

Œ I don™t want to hear nothing, not even about 
Austria
, or 
France
, or 
Greece
, or 
Poland
, or Œ or here, the republicans and the democrats, or the thousand mer Œ 
thousand American dictatorships. It doesn™t interest me. I am a Germ an, and I want 

to make sure that the Germans, we are like t he Jews, we are a chosen people. Not 

through God, through our crimes. And we should know exactly how Œ how far it 
can lead if you don™t have civil courage. It l eads m y father to the gall ows, and it  
leads a mill ion of innocent people i nto the death. So never mention this again, that 

other people also have done this. Bad. 

Q: I think you™re ri ght. I think this Œ I thi nk thi s is the conclusion of our interview. 

A: Thank you. See ya. 

Q: And I Œ  wait, no, no, please. We still have to do it officially. But thank you very 

much for that. And thank you very much for t he rest of the intervi ew, and sharing 
your thoughts with us, and sharing much more. 
A: Thank you. 

Q: Do you have any ot her things you would like to say? 

A: Oh, I Œ a lot of questions which weren™t asked. 

Q: Oh boy.  

A: No, no, 
[indeciphera ble]
 
you werereally great.
 
Q: But truly, is there any fi nal word?

A: That was a final word. It makes me alwa ys crazy. Sorry for my Œ  
Q: That™s oka y. 

A: Œ attacki ng you, but Œ but this I Œ 
Q: That™s oka y. 
A: Œ alwa y Œ it™s always Œ it™s Œ it™s two questi ons, I s Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ if I have a public discussion. 

Q: Presentation, yeah, mm-
hm.
 
A: Presentation, di scussion. The first is alwa ys, they are asking me, now you have 

written three books about your family, do you feel free now? All this stupid thi ng, 
and I alwa ys sa y, are you a German? You are a German. How did you deal with 
your parent s, your grandparents? There ma y be love, big 
[indeciphera ble]
. But 
what have they done? Have you ever looked at it? How do you feel? You have t he 

pictures and Œ in your brain with Œ with t he ki lled people. How do you react? Why I 

am example for you? Everybody has to do this. That woul d be good. 

Q: And the second is is this sort of evening out, by sa ying everybody, yeah. 

A: Yeah, yeah.

Interview with Niklas Frank

Beginning Part Two 
 
Q: This is 
Leslie Swift
, recording a segment of an interview with 
Niklas Frank
, on 
June 6
th
, 2016, and we will be focusing right now on Œ mostly on 
Niklas™s 
book, 
and what he talks about , his father and his fami ly, in the book. So 
Niklas
, wa Œ 
we 
spend a lot of time studyi ng here at the museum, what leads people t o other-ise 
Jews and Œ  and other Œ other people, and Œ to t he point where the y are no longer 

human, and thus disposable. Can you trace for us, to the best of your understanding, 

this person Œ the personal journe y that led your father from being someone who was 

trained in t he law, and presumably respected i t, to the acceptance, and even 

enthusiasti c participation in mass murder? 

A: I think Œ I know m y father wasn™t an ant i-Semitic. And he wanted to have a 
career. And if 
Hitler
 would have chosen not the Jews, but let™s say t he Italians, or 
the Gypsies, or Œ Gypsi es had had already chosen Œ or let™s say the Swedish people, 

he would have said the same sentences agai nst  them. It was just t hat he wanted to 

be near to 
Hitler
, and he wanted to have a good career. 

Q: So he didn™t have this underlyi ng anti-Jewi sh feeling that some of the other true 

believers did. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
117
 
A: No. I have his youth diary. He wrote it Œ it™s not very t hick Œ he wrote it in the 
time when he was 17 til the 20
th
 year of his life. And there was not a single remark 
against the Jews. And it was already after the first World War. So when 
Germany
 
really was on the button, and big inflation and took away some parts of 
Germany
, 
and all this kind of stuff, he only complained about the French, and not about the 
Jews. 
Q: About t he occupation of the 
[indecipherable]
 

A: Yes, not Œ not only t he occupation, I think something l ike the y took away our 

girls, the French. 

Q: And, at several points in the book, you insert brackets that serve as pleas to your 

father to choose another course, one that woul d have hi m stand up to 
Hitler
, and 
prevent hi m from becomi ng the man that he eventually became. Do you think t hat 
he Œ why do you think he didn™t take this path? Was it coward
ice, or acombinati on 
of things? What Œ what  about 
Hitler
 was so at tractive to hi m?  

Q: You have to remember the situation in 
Germany
. Before the first World War, 
Germ
a ny
 was really a leading nati on, in i ndustrialization. We got the most 
Nobel
 
prizes. The American students, for instance, came, studying medicine, to 
Germany
. 
We really was a brilliant country. And suddenl y, everythi ng was gone, everything 

was gone. And it was, for sure, the Treaty of 
Versailles
 after the war, which made 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016

Hitler
 possible. My father wrote in his youngster™s diary, 
Germany
 needs his 
honor back. We need a strong person, who can fulfill this task. Ma ybe it™s me. But 
then it was 
Hitler
. So, the m
iddle class in 
Germany
, and I woul d sa y most of the 
people, were really l ooking for becoming a nation again, full of honor. This was the 

one side. And the other side was really the economical sit uation, which was very 
bad. And t here was about 10 million unemployed people, growing, and we had the 
inflation. And then suddenly there were the people in the brown dress, marching i n 

good rows  
[indeci phera ble]
 in German, the word, yes. And the y had the special 
program, not looki ng to the right, and to t he left, just we have our program, and 

hitting everybody who was against  it. For inst ance, the communists, yes. So this 

was it Œ something which a lot of people att racted, in 
Germany
. And 
Hitler 
was a 
brilliant speaker. He was really very good. He wouldn™t have succeeded if at this 
time was already 
TV
, for instance. It was his personal appearance, and this very, 
very strong speeches he delivered everywhere. And when he came to power, he 
really managed that the unemployment was nearly gone. And there was a big, big 

improvement in 
Germany
. There™s a very famous German-Jewish historian, 
Sebastian Haffner
, he is dead since many years. He wrot e a book about 
Hitler
, and 

he wrote in it, if 
Hitler
 would have died t hrough a traffic accident in 1938, he 
would be remembered as a great, great statesman, because he brought back 
Austria
, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
119
 
and it was a Œ 
a 
Œ now really in a good employment sitting. People, German people, 
were satisfied. And on the other hand was this really, I would sa y tilt to 

homosexuality, this relation from m y father to 
Hitler
. It was really, really, really 

personal. 

Q: And so, you mentioned before that y Œ you don™t think your father was a true 
anti-Semite, the wa y that many of the Œ the original Nazis were, and it was more a 
case of expedienc y t han anything else. And Œ and I just wondered, does that Œ does 

that make him better, or worse, in your eyes? That Œ that he didn™t have a belief, but 

just sort of went along with the ti de? 

A: It didn™t change anything. If you are an ardent believer, an ardent anti-Semite, 

yo
u also have your 10 commandments in your head. You don™t have to kill innocent 
people. And if you are Œ if you are only somebody who wants to make a career, it™s 
the same. For Œ for me it wouldn™t have changed anything. 
Q: Oka y. And in the book I noticed that God comes up a lot. And what Œ what 

usefulness do you believe God served for your father? Do you thi nk he was a true 

believer in any sense, even at the end? And do you have any personal  memories of 

hi m speaking about God, before 1945? 

A: No, I don™t have personal memories, but if you count how often al l the speeches 

of top Nazis, starti ng with 
Hitler
, goingdown til 
Œ 
til m yfather, how oftthem 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
120
 
mention God. You would sa y that was the most religious part you ever worked in 
Germany
. It™s always t he same old trick. What you are doing, you have to Œ alwa ys 
have to go out in your sentences. No. 

Q: Yeah. And Œ and so, from what I™ve read on the subject, God and Nazism, the 

concept of God and Nazism was really c ynical  and prac Œ and sort of a cynical in a 
practical purpose. But God was not allowed t o really supersede 
Hitl er
. And I™m just 
wondering what are Œ what are your own conceptions of God, if you feel okay 
talking about that. I mean, do you Œ 
are youa believer?Do youhave any notion of 

that, or Œ you know, it Œ unless that™s too personal. 

A: Starting with m y father, when m y father was in prison, he used to write a lot of 

letters back home. They al wa ys were read aloud from my mother, and I really was 

full of contempt for those letters, because there was s
o much 
Œ so often mentioned 
God. And as a child especially, you i mmediatel y feel that™s all a li e, t hat™s not really 

true.And my brother 
Norman
 said, when 
Hitl er
 was dead, he was looking for 
another gui de, and he found it in God. And myself, I was brought 
up very 
Œ in a 
very Cathol ic wa y, because 
Schliersee
, especi ally upper 
Bavaria
 was, at this ti me, 
very Cathol ic. And I had m y big struggle with God, because as a Catholic, you 

alwa ys have those confessions, and when it came to the sixth commandment, it was 

really horrible for everybody, I would sa y. Especially for boys. And I loved Œ I 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
121
 
never really believed in God. I never really. And in the meanti me, it™s Œ it™s Œ t here 
is a Œ a very offending word in German. It™s 
K asperldiada
(ph), I don™t know the 

American version. Yeah 
Kasperle
(ph) is Œ is funny figure in Œ on the strings, 
puppet on the strings, for children. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Yeah. And 
Kasperl e
(ph) was a name of a l ittle, with a big nose, who was always 
very funny. And this 
K asperlediada
(ph) is something like 
a 
[indecipherable]
 for 

this kind of stuff. I don™t believe in Œ in Œ in any religions. For me it™s an Œ it™s 

inventions. Ma ybe human beings have al wa ys this Œ the y wanted to have a 

connection to the other world. I don™t believe i n another world. Ti l Œ t o the 

[indecipherable]
 of my soul. 

Q: Well, I™m right there with you, so Œ j ust a little editorializing. So, when your 
book came out, 
Ina
 got  into a little bit about th-th Œ the reception of it, and the Œ 
what people Œ some people were shocked, and Œ and that kind of thing. Were you 

surprised by the Œ by the reaction, and did you lose any friends, or did Œ did Œ did 

your relations with Œ with other people that  you knew change when the book came 

out?  

A: I was very much surprised. I was especially surprised about m y fel low 

journalists, because I thought everybody of the journalist know exactl y why I have 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
122
 
written thi s book, because it was against 
[indeciphera ble]
 in 
Germany
. But, the y 
also only part of the German people, so the y accused me the same. The friendships 
didn™t change. No, the y didn™t change. But , what never came out up til now, there™s 

nobody is really in private, asking me questions about thi s. Never. Til nowada ys. 

The y know it™s something like Œ t here is something ugly with 
Niklas
. Don™t touch 
it. It™s more this wa y. 
Q: You mean, aski ng you questions about th-t he details, or Œ 

A: The book, about the book, about the details about comparing t hemselves and 

their parents, and so it never came out 
also wi th
 m y friends.  

Q: And was that an ex Œ 
so you 
Œ  that was an explicit motivation for you to writ e 
the book, was it because Œ 

A: No, not against my friends, and so. It was t he silence. 
Q: No, but to Œ the silence in 
Germany
, that Œ that Œ that Œ 
A: It was t he only reason. 
Q: Œ you Œ you wanted to Œ you wanted to break that, and break it in very shocking 
way, in a very Œ 

A: Not shocking. I didn™t know that™s really shocking. I was very honest when I 

wrote this. So, if you are furious, your language isn™t the best one. So I kept it. The 

publishing company tried to change it. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
123
 
Q: Did they? Mm-
hm.
 
A: And I said, no, not a word. If you don™t  want to print it, maybe I find another 
publisher, but I wi ll change nothing. And they Œ they didn™t change it, in the end. 

Q: Oka y. And was it a bestseller? 

A: In the whole, I woul d sa y there™s two pocket editions, and about 55,000. 
Q: Did you Œ did you receive any correspondence or fan mail that was Œ was real ly 
thankful, for you t o have done thi s? 

A: Yes. There was Œ but was only rare in comparison to the accusat ion I got from 

the people. 

Q: So, one of the things I really liked about the book was your use of black humor. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: I Œ I Œ 
I really 
Œ 
I 
Œ 
I 
Œ I Œ I myself have a very difficult relationshi p with my 
family, and that™s one way I get through i t is t o Œ to be funny about it , you know. 

But one of my favorite things that  you said was that you referred to ha Œ
 Hans 

Frank
 as 
Rosemary™s 
baby, which I thought was Œ was great. But, can you just 
speak a little bit about t hat, about how that hel ps you cope, how being able to be 

funny, whi le at the same ti me talki ng about thi s really horrible subject matter. 

What™s Œ what™s your t hinking behind that? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
124
 
A: I-I only can repeat , I wanted to be really honest, and I don™t Œ didn™t want to 
mak e
 any how 
[indecipherable]
 compromise. I didn™t want to make any 
compromise. But Œ but if you look at our history, you can™t come up with any 

compromise. So, t his I wanted to write, that we have to acknowledge what our 

people have done. 
Q: And I ha Œ I have to say that on Œ one t hing that struck me also, about that use of 
black humor was it  Œ that because we work at t he Holocaust Museum, and we deal 

with this material every da y, this horrible mat erial, we also use that as a coping 

mechanism, so I sort of recognize that in the book as well. But i
t 
Œ here comes a non 

sequitur Œ so I was reading, and Œ and your father at one point early on, worked for 

the film workers™ union? 

A: Yes. 
Q: And what Œ what Œ what exactly was that? 
A: There was a union, it was very short. I found it in one of the document. I 

couldn™t find any more about this profession. 

Q: But Œ but, like Œ 

A: I think i t was j ust to Œ to get mo Œ 
mo re mon ey.
 
Q: Working
 for Œ for people who work for 
ufa
(ph) or something. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
125
 
A: Yes, everybody wor Œhe was based in 
Munich
, we had  
[indeciphera ble
]
 it was 
all the big movie ci ty, besides 
Berlin
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And ma ybe Œ but it was very short ti me. 

Q: And then Œ and while you were talking t o 
Ina
, you 
Œ you mentioned that your Œ 
your father™s mother lived in 
Poland
 some of the ti me, is that right? She 
lived with 
you?
 
A: Yes. He wasn™t quit e a happy guy, m y father, when he was young. His mother 

left him, went with his little sister, to a new lover, to 
Prague
. So he li ved with his 

father alone. And when m y father became famous and rich, his mother suddenl
y 
showed up again. 

Q: And did she, that you recall, have any opini ons, feelings about  th-t he situation in 
Poland
, either ger Œ you know, sort of writ large 
Germany™s
 
acti ons in 
Poland
, or 
specifics of what was happening to the Polish people, and Œ and t o the Jew? Was Œ 
was there any kind of sense of that? 

A: No. I don™t know anyt hing special, but I know that she Œ a lot of letters I have of 

hers to his son in Œ in prison, and he alw Œ she alwa ys defended hi m, as innocent. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And he Œ by the way, he hated m y mother, and he was full on the side of 
Lilly
. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
126
 
Q: Oh, oka y. Okay. And then at one point you said you Œ when you were talking to 
Ina
, you said that  your mother was very practi cal and pragmatic. She sort of really 
saw things the wa y they were. But  then, i n the book, you sa y Œ i t™s just sort of one 

line where you sa y, your mother thought that unconditional surrender was wrong, 

when it came right down to it, she Œ I guess sh Œ did she think that there was some 
way of preserving 
Germany
 in Œ in some way
, or 
Œ  
A: Not in a political way. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: My mother never was a member of the party, and when the power of the 
Frank
 

family was at the hi ghest point, she said to my father, and the other si blings were 

around, and she said, I know exactly. I wil l Œ i t will come the ti me where I will 

nourish m y children wi th m y typewriter machi ne again. So she Œ and on the other 
hand it™s clear, if you were Œ had a luxury life, and suddenly you would like t o have 
to go it Œ let it go on now. So she tried, but was never Œ she was politi cally not 

interested. She hated the screaming speeches of m y father, and she didn™t like 

soldiers, all this ki nd of uniforms, no, she didn™t like. 

Q: Mm. Oka y. And Œ so tha Œ at one point you also write you mother has a 

handwriting analysis done for your father? 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
127
 
Q: And Œ and do you know why she did t hat? 
A: The family of 
Franks
, and Œ no, not 
Franks
, it was more 
Herbst
, as she born 
into the family of 
Herbst
. And the y were al ways having t his kind of séances, and 

with the cards. 

Q: Oka y, so it was kind of a m ystical Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: We grew up wit h it. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I loved i t very much, was very good. 

Q: Oka y. And so now, to get to the film t hat you™re donati ng. You™ve probably seen 

it many ti mes by now. 
A: No. I refused 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 always 
Q: You refuse Œ 
A: But I™ve Œ twice I must have seen it. 

Q: You Œ t wice you™ve seen it, okay. 

A: I can™t stand m yself. 

Q: Oka y, yeah. And so Œ so 
Erika
(ph) 
Noble
(ph) sent Œ sent thi s footage to you Œ  
A: Ah, thi s film. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
128
 
Q: That fil m, that 
film.
 
A: I thought you Œ 
you were 
Œ oh, sorry, no. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: 
Erika
(ph) alwa ys answers to me, yes. Sorry. 

Q: Yeah, so Œ so I™ll just go over quickly, the Œ the history of that, so that we have 
that on the record. We found out about this from 
Erika
(ph)
 Noble
(ph), whose uncle 
was friendly with your father at 
Nuremberg
, right? Was he an interpreter, or Œ  
A: No. 
Q: What 
Œ what was the story on that? 
A: It was Lieutenant 
Stein
. He was a Œ who arrested Œ  

Q: It Œ oka y, th-the gu Œ the man you were talking about, right? So s Œ so, do you 

know how Œ how it ended up with him? Did he take it from Œ from your father? 
A: My mother was very clever. She immediat el y became friends wit h Lieutenant 
Stein
(ph). So m y mother gave hi m the diary, t he used diary of my fat her. The 

original has vanished, and on every page of the reprint is printed, copyright 

Lieutenant 
Stein
, 
Walter Stein
, which not is so really honest, I would sa y. He al so 
took awa y t he leather coat of m y father, which I bought back from an aunt of 

Erika
(ph)
 Noble
(p
h) for 500 dollars. 
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
129
 
A: And it™s now 
[indeciphera ble]
 at the lake, which we have at our house. 
Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: And I am enjoyi ng i t every da y when I look at the coat  of m y father hanging as a 

[indecipherable]
 
Five hundr
ed dollars, the most expensi ve 
[indecipherable]
 
you 
can i magine. 
Q: Yes. 
A: And so they met, Li eutenant
 Stein
, he arrested him and sent Œ 
he musthave been 
veryoftentogether with my mother.
 
Q: Oka y. So he got it from your mother. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And he wasn™t t he i nterpreter. 
Q: Oka y. Was there any suggesti on of any romantic Œ 
A: No, no, no, he was Œ no, no, no. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: No, no.  

Q: And so Œ so the way we found out about it was we got an emai l Œ I got an email 

out of the blue, from 
Erika
(ph) sayi ng I have this footage, ma ybe you™re interested, 
and we jumped all over it, because i t was j ust amazing. And then, by the time we 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
130
 
sort of were trying to make arrangements for her to send it to us, she had sent it to 
you, because she felt Œ and that Œ this makes sense Œ 

A: Correct. 

Q: Œ that it  belonged to you, because you were the Œ the heir, you know. And then 

we were so upset, because we wanted it, and Œ but understood, you know, where 
she was coming from. And then, you know, many years later now, we™re Œ we™re 
making thi s happen. B ut Œ but I st Œ I d Œ I hadn't quite gotten the st ory of Œ of how 

it got from here to there to here, you know, so Œ so it™s good to have i t on record, I 

think. And then, t o continue though, to talk about the fil m, which we™ll watch 

tomorrow, so we can talk about it together, but the d Œ do you th Œ ha Œ did the fil m 

Œ has the film when you™ve seen it, has it awakened any sympathy, or Œ 
or more 

anger, or any other kinds of emotions, or in any way changed your vi ewpoint on 
your 
Œ about your fami l y, seeing them in t hese inti mate si tuations? 
A: No, it hasn™t changed anything. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I was very glad to see m y brother 
Norman
 with his carriage with the horses, 
that™s nice. And the other pictures when the y™re sitting in front of 
Kressendorf
, and 

so they are alwa ys t hinking the y Œ 
Norman
 
di dn™tknow exactly, but thegrownups, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
131
 
they Œ everybody knew what™s Œ really what™s going on, and the y are sitting there in 
the sun. That always gave me Œ wel l, it infuriat es me. 

Q: Infuri Œ so it act ually made Œ made it worse, in a way, to see this. 

A: As in Œ  in the beginning of this film, there is this Œ m y father is sit ting in the 

Wawel
, and the adjutant is kem Œ coming to him, he™s Œ he™s ah, he™s pretending to 
be a rocking Œ hard looking and si gning somet hing. Ooh, terrible. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. And do you think that the book would have been any different, if 

you had had the film to refer to? Do you thi nk you would have added details from 

the Œ from t he film, or anyt hing li ke that? No. Let™s see. So I Œ I find t he film 

personally, especially i nteresting for a lot of reasons, not least because I™ve now 

spent a lot of time studying the concept of amateur film, home movies, and things 

like that, and what i t can tell us, especially how it can contradict, and complement 
the official records, such as, you know, newsreels, propaganda pieces, 
Nuremberg  
footage; all of these places where your father appears in official capacities. A
nd yet 

here he is in this amateur film Œ not that he™s more authentic there, but that it™s a 

different view. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And so you can put those two pieces together, and get a bigger picture. And, di-

di Œ I already asked you this question, an-and the answer i s no, but Œ but to see these 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
132
 
two pieces t ogether, does that complicate your Œ your view of your family life at 
all?  

A: No. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No. I found it really interesting, this materi al, that I have the Œ especially the 
scenes with the Jews. 
Q: Mm-hm, that i s Œ that™s incredible. 

A: And there is one scene where Œ 

Q: We have nothing like that. Do you remember 
any 
Œ were you on that trip, do you 

remember that at all? No, no. So, let™s see – I think some of these questions have 

alreadybeen asked. So I 
Œ o-oka y, so were there specific turning points for you, that 
you can remember, as your opini on of your father developed over ti me, or Œ and 
was the process, in comi ng to terms wit h your mother and your brot her and your 
other sibli ngs, a Œ a different process, bec Œ per-perhaps because they were still 
alive, and he was dead? 

A: Well, we start becoming older, we star ted to talk about it a lot. Whenever we 

met , we tal ked about our father, and all the Œ more about our father, and also about 

our mother
. It Œ 
it was a 
Œ what it meant, which I would sa y it led to Œ to nothing. 
We repeated each other. I have more and more new documents, but Œ but we were

still friendly, and we were really in a good mood. And I never accused them, saying 
you have to change if you Œ and come on, and Œ 

Q: You weren™t tryi ng t o convince them. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. It seems that Œ 
A: And for me it™s not t hey have to Œ m y siblings I have to compare with the normal 
surroundings I had with other people. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Nobody is really Œ really talking about it, and really saying something, the same 

as m y sibli ngs. 

Q: Right, right. And so some of the scenes in t he book could be consi dered Œ I 

mean, obscene is a word that™s Œ t hat has j udgment attached to it, whi ch I d Œ I don™t 
mean to imply, but there are scenes t hat are Œ t hat could be called obscene, and I™m 
just wondering what are Œ what are you tryi ng to say to your father with that, with Œ 

with those scenes? Are Œ are you trying to vent  anger at him, are you trying to sa y Œ  
A: Not tryi ng, I really was angry. 

Q: Right. 

A: And if you are angry about one, you are losing your Œ your educat ion. 

Q: Right, right.

A: And I was Œ I will never forget it, when I wrote this, I was really happy that I 
really can fight hi m, that I really can excuse Œ accuse hi m, and that I really can 

counter hi m with very bad words. 

Q: And in terms of the Œ and I hope you don™t mind me asking this, but in terms of 

the se Œ scene of the masturbation, in the Œ  
A: It™s cut out in t he American edit ion. 
Q: I don™t think so. 

A: Oh, for sure. 

Q: Really? 

A: Oh! 

Q: How do I know about it then? Do I read Œ I didn™t read about it  in t he German 

version. 
A: In the American version is Œ everything cut  out is famous, notorious 
masturbation scene. It™s Œ 

Q: Really? 

A: The only sentence is, I even got physical pl easure. That™s the only thing which 

was left. 

Q: Oh, oka y, well I mean, ma ybe I read that  as masturbat ion. B ut Œ 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

A: That™s a big scene with Œ a big scene, because it™s Œ t he y had to cut out about 
four mentions of this. 

Q: That™s i nteresting. But anyway, m y point was Œ 

A: The Œ the guy in the Œ 
Jonathan

American
 
yo u 
Œ he was Œ 
Q: Who?
 
A: Œ the publishing Œ 
Kno pf

New York
. 
Q: Oh oka y Œ oka y. 

A: And he was so rat faced when I told him, I want to have it. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And he said, well 
Niklas
, I know the American markets, the y won™t buy it, I 

don™t have t o print it. 

Q: Oh m y God, we™re such prudes, aren™t we? But Œ 
but li 
Œ can I just tell you my 
reading of that scene, and you wil l tell me how wrong I am, or if I™m Œ you know, 

tell me a different story. My reading of that scene is that you are doing that, because 

you™re Œ you™re Œ you™re Œ you™re trying to reach the ulti mate poi nt of joy and 
pleasure at your fa Œ that your father is dead. 

A: No. 

Q: No. Oka y, tell me. 

A: Exactly the other way around. 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
136
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: You have to i magine that the nearer the 16
th
 of October came, yes, when I 
was a 
child, the more Œ not of m y mother, but of m y siblings, and the relatives, was the 

urge to celebrate. To celebrate a man and the 
inno centess
 of a man which I, even 
then, despi sed, yes, without really knowing what he has done, when I was young. 
Nine, eight, 10, 11 years old. And this is a big pleasure on a little soul  like mine, 
when you are young. And it was j ust a reli ef, it was just a relief. 

Q: A relief, oka y, oka y, oka y, interesting. So, it seems that it™s clear that your father 

constantly craved 
Hitler™s 
approval , and was always disappointed because 
Hitler
 

didn™t really have much respect for him, if any at all. And Œ 
and that readsto me,at 

least, as a father-son relationship, the Œ the f Œ the father constantly di sappointing 

the son. And I Œ I wonder if that is Œ is a theme in the book in the sense that, you 
know, this relationships between fathers and sons, is there a parall el there? Because 
you 
Œ 
you rid 
Œ you were rejected by your father, and then you rejected your father. 
But, your f Œ your Œ your father never rejected 
Hitler
 til t he Œ til t he end. And I-I™m 
just wondering if you see any parallel there, if you see any cause Œ cause the whole 

book seems to be about fathers and sons. Most ly about your relationship with your 

Œ with your father, but there™s also Œ I kept thi nking, there™s this Œ there™s some kind 
of filial relation bet ween 
Hitler 
and Œ and 
Hans Frank
 that™s not bei ng fulfilled, 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
137
 
the wa y 
Hans Frank
 wants it to be fulfilled. So that™s not really a question, it™s just 
sort of an observation, and a Œ 
and a 
Œ and Œ and a Œ I Œ I™m just wondering what  
you think about that Œ t hat theory. You can tell me it™s bullshit, if you want. 

Q: Can be Œ 
can 
Œ no, no, no, can be. Alwa ys t he reader finds out something which 

the writer didn™t know of, that you can read it in it. I remember writing those 12 
weeks, where for me, as if my father was Œ would have 
sitten
 
on the oppositeside, 
like you now, and I could tell hi m everythi ng, what made me furious. This was t he 
situation. Andwhether it™s 
in a transitional  kind of art, that something is reflecting 
Hitler
 and m y father, and me and m y father, I really don™t know. I Œ I hesitant Œ 
I 

had nothing in mind. When I was sitting down the first da y, in the morning, I had 10 

or 12 weeks holiday, so I could write it, from ﬁ
Stern
ﬂ magazine, and I didn™t know 
exactly
 how to writ e it. I had a lot of files. And then it st arted with the first 
sentence, and then Œ then I knew I had to address him personally. To you. And t hat 

was it. 

Q: That™s Œ  I think that ™s a very important poi nt, because I think t hat Œ that really 
strengthens the book and Œ 
and makes it so much morepersonal, that  you™re 
Œ that 
you™re actually addressing him. That was Œ that was m y feeling when I was reading 

it. Let™s see. Oh, one ot her Œ another thing that ™s sort of related, is Œ is it seems to 

me that you 
Œ 
you s 
Œ you take several opportunities to inflict posthumous pain on 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
138
 
your father by Œ by sort  of constantly pointing out how lit tle he meant  to 
Hitler
. 
You know, he Œ he Œ I Œ I mean, you do t hat in general, but Œ but there are several 

points where you™re sayi ng, 
you know,
 you didn™t Œ 
you didn™t 
mean anyt hing t o 
Hitler
.
 Hitl er 
didn™t Œ rejected you in the foll owing wa y. So I Œ I thought that was 

sort of an interesting device to Œ to Œ to use. Now I™m just sort of givi ng m y own 
opinion, so I™m going t o try and st op that. 
A: I™m thankful that you™re giving this opinion. 

Q: Let™s see. Oh, so okay, this is Œ this is interesting. What Œ what di d or do you 

think about the sort of minor cri minals who s Œ who escaped with their lives, and 

even went back to normal  life? Did you ever pursue any kind of Œ legally, or as a Œ 

to cover them journalistically, or try to expose them?  
A: No. I tri ed in all  my articles to defend democrac y, but I started as a cultural 
editor, so I wa Œ mostly together wi th the German writers, and actors, and so. And 
later on, when I was a war correspondent for ﬁ
Stern
ﬂ magazine, it  was also quit e 
another thing to deal with. And no, it Œ it ™s now Œ now I am doing it, with my last 

book on this earth, about denazification. I went into the Œ into the archives in 

Germany
, too, and tell ing them, I don™t give you names, but you hand me over files 
from 
A
 to Zed, just to get a clue what™s a middle class, lower Nazi s, th-the Œ the 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

139
 
Fürher of villages and of some areas, what they have done, and how do the y defend 
themselves? And it  was really great . 

Q: Great. 

A: It™s really great what you find out. You find really out that this is very strict wa y 

from there, to Œ 
to nowada y 
Germany
. Because personal
ly you can  say,  ev eryb ody 
who is accused can defend himself, yeah? That™s for sure, that™s Œ that™s a human 

right, inside the democracy, for instance. But how the y did it, it™s so full of 

cowardice, again. It™s so unbelievable. So I always said, before we had this cro Œ 

big problem now with refugees, I used to say t o the people, when they asked me, do 

you th
ink t hat this will happen again? And I al ways used to say yes. We only Œ if 
we have about five to six years really heavy economical problems, for instan
ce, we 

will have another 
H itler
, and we will buil d up, not the gas chambers, because they 
are known Œ too well known, but we will get other things to invent, to make the 
guilty new ones dead. 

Q: I-In 
Germany
, or el sewhere?  
A: In 
Germany
. No, I don™t think 
[indeciphera ble]
 elsewhere, just i n 
Germany
.  
Q: Just in 
Germany
. 
A: Because now you can see, that I never thought about refugees, because it was a 

brand new problem, and you see it exactly how the silent  majority of the Germans 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank 
June 6, 2016 
 
 
 
140
 
really think, how t he y really behave, what Œ and that Œ wow, 
that I™m very much 
afraid of. 

Q: And Œ and what  Œ have you followed at all the Œ the more current war crimes 

trials against the, very old at this point, Nazis Œ 

A: Yes, I followed it in the newspapers. 
Q: And do you thi nk it™s worthwhile to st ill be prosecuting these peopl e? 
A: For sure, for sure. 

Q: Yeah. And why? What do you think i s Œ is the benefit? 

A: The benefit is that ma ybe a little bit more people who are readi ng the newspaper, 

or who are attending the trial, find out what we have really done, and ma ybe they™ll 

think it over again, and acknowledge what we have done. But most of them are ve
ry 

old now, about 95 years old, and the Œ 
it™s most 
Œ most of them are gone. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. And so, turning back to your book, there™s Œ I think this is a really Œ 

and this is the Œ the English transl ation, but I i magine it™s si milar in Œ in German. 

You sa y you already had a full tank of that poisonous bile, which for me, in m y 

days of the Third Reich, was turned into chocolate and loll ipops. Can you tell us 

what you meant by that? Does this Œ 
does this 
hint that you felt any guilt from 

benefitting from these spoils? 

A: No. As a child Œ today I™m always

Ina
?

Q2: I shake my head. 
A: I shake m y head, wondering what that I was living t here, swi mming on a lake of 

blood, the same like my parents di d. It™s j ust 
[indeciphera ble].
 I enj oyed it very 
much to have a good chocolate, to have all the toys, to Œ to drive 
in big 
Mercedes
, 
to Œ everybody was friendly to me, it was a very good life. 
Q: And do you remember when you re Œ realized, or started to real ize what the 
trade-off was there, that Œ 

A: It was after the war Œ 

Q: After the war. 

A: Œ when the first now 
democraticpapers came out
, newspapers, in 
Germany
 
called Œ the first one were from the American mil itary 
[i ndecipherable]
 new 
newspaper. And there were pictures of killed Jews, also children of my age then, six 
to eight to 10 years old. And alwa ys was underlined 
Poland
. And I thought the y 
were Œ that 
Poland
 was ours. And suddenly m y father, and the whole family was 
connected to these corpses. That was the first shock. The same, by the wa y, as 

Norman 
t old me.
 
When 
Norman 
saw these pictures, he said to my m other, there i s 
no chance for Father Œ for our father. I think we know Œ now go i nto t he dark. He 

was very pessi mistic when he saw the pictures.  

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

142
 
Q: And do you thi nk that that Œ that the experience that he had growing up, do you 
think that contribut ed to hi m becoming an alcoholic? 

A: For sure. For sure. 

Q: Because he was t he oldest, and Œ  

A: Not because he was the oldest son, but  he never found out a wa y out of this trap, 
to love his father, and on the other hand acknowledging that he was a criminal. But 
he was the wittiest alcoholic I ever, ever came across. 

Q: So, you also write in the book that, paraphrasing, that your father stated, or made 

some decree or something, that Jews were vectors of deceit, disease, and they were 

subhuman. Do you think he really 
believed
 that? 
A: No. 

Q: And Œ and it was more of a Œ a sort of an expedient polic y Œ 
A: No, it was Œ  
Q: A directi ve?  

A: Œ I hope that 
Hi tler 
reads it.  
Q: Oh. 

A: I hope t hat somebody i s telling 
Hitler
 what  Œ that I have this 
strong
en
 

sentences. He was an educated man, he doesn™t only sa y, we have to kill the Jews 

wherever we find them. He also has said t his. But he tried to be, also, an educated 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

man in these kind of sentences. He Œ he didn™t  sa y this one famous sentence also. 
Somebody has tol d hi m that in Œ in 
Czechoslovakia
 
they make aplacard 
Œ placard. 
Q: Mm-hm, placard, 
yeah .
 
Q2: A poster. 

A: A poster telling about eight persons who has been killed as hostages, yes? And 
m y father said, if I would print posters for every 50 Polish people I let  shoot, the 
woods of 
Poland
 wouldn™t be enough to get t he paper. Now that i s a well-educated 
sentence. It™s not, I kill  much more Polish people than you kill over t here, 

Czechoslovakish 
people. 

Q: Right. 

A: Well that is his kind of thing, or the ot her example was the flat footed Indian. 

Q: Right. 
A: He wouldn™t have done something ugl
y 
wit h them. That™s great, that™s 
[indecipherable]
  
Q: And so he Œ 
he was alsoin 
Œ he was educated in a lot of ways. He was a piano 
player, you said. And t here was something in the book, I believe, about him 
composing a song about Œ he Œ he composed a song Œ something to do with 

composing a song of Œ of occupying territory, or something like that? Does that Œ 

A: Yes.

Q: Am I misrememberi ng this? 
A: No, no, it™s a poem of him. 

Q: Oh, oka y. Okay. And was it Œ was it set to music, or it was a poem? 
A: No, no,  it was not set in music. 
Q: It was a poem, oka y. 
A: We got

Q: Oka y, oka y. And so, I Œ 
I™m 
Œ I™m really fascinated by your mother™s fascination 
with furs, and I have to, full disclosure say that part of it is because I™m a 

vegetarian, and I find it  very interesting that someone would be so Œ j ust 
meatful
 Œ 
I mean, an addiction to furs, almost, it seemed like. And I Œ I Œ I j ust Œ  I guess the 
connection that I™m makingin my mindi s 
Œ is that he Œ here™s the fact that she™s 
literally stealing the ski n of an ani mal from another ani mal, that ani mal being a 
human, and it seems to have a very Œ a v Œ 
a very deep metaphorical  meaning, 
somehow, to me.
 

A: For vegetarians. 

Q: Well, for anybody, but yeah, especially for me, being a vegetarian. And Œ and 

again here, I™m just stat ing m y Œ m y sort of reading of it, but I just Œ I just wanted to 

say that, because I t hought it was so interesting that she Œ I Œ 
an

worked in t he fur trade before, so she was Œ

A: No, no.  
Q: Before the war? 

A: No. 

Q: Right? No? 

A: She was a secretary, she was alwa ys Œ 
Q: Oh, so what was the Œ 
A: Œ since her yout h time, she was interested in furs Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ and so she made business with Jewi sh agents Œ 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Œ who gave her furs, and she took them in commission, sold it with much mone y 

and got the difference. 
Q: So, do you have any sense of why she was so into furs? 
A: It™s a good profession. 

Q: No, but I mean, for herself, you know. 

A: Furs were something that were t he Œ 

Q: Because it was a luxury item, or  Œ  
A: Œ in thi s Œ in t hose ti mes Œ in those ti me it were furs were the most precious 

thing for Œ for women t o wear.

Q: Right, right. 
A: But, by the way, when it came to the divorce, m y mot her and m y father had a 

different lawyer for the divorce. Then the lawyer of m y mother came to m y father 

that he wanted to Œ to get a fee. And m y father said, I won™t pay you. My wife can 

sell some of her 100 furs. 
Q: Did she have a favorite type of fur? 
A: No.

wrote about it. 

A: In Œ in

 they are also nowada ys, are really protected. 
Q: Well, they should be. Okay, so Œ 
I™m 
Œ I™m almost done. So Œ so Œ  

A: I™m not in a hurry. 

Q: I Œ 
ok ay. By 
Œ up to page 154, there is no, t hat I noticed, there™s no talk of filial 

love, or worship. The normal feelings of a young boy for his father, from the very Œ 

from the young age, before you realize, before any Œ 
any 
child real izes that his 

parents are not perfect, and that they™re flawed, and etcetera. And do you rem Œ do 

you remember havi ng any of those feelings for your father, before you started 
realizing what was real l y going on? 
A: No, just th Œ around the table Œ  

Q: Just the chasing around th
e table.
 
A: Œ and Œ and the foam on m y nose. That™s Œ 

Q: Mm-hm. That™s it. 

A: Why do I have this still in my head? So it™s Œ I was l onging for hi s love. 

Q: Right, right, ri ght. Let™s see. Oh, what does mi nister without portfolio mean? 

 
Interview with Niklas Frank

A: Yeah, you have Œ f or instance, you have the foreign mi nister, the defense 
minister, t he econom y mi nister and if you don™t have something l ike this, we have 
no portfolio, you are just a 
Reichsminister
. 

Q: Oka y. So that™s before h
e became 
Œ 

A: Governor general
,  yes
. 
Q: Oka y. And is it  a Œ it Œ so it™s a lesser title, because you don™t have a portfolio. 

A: It™s a Œ what is good mone y accompany wit h it, and when Œ ™33, 
Hitler
 took 

over power. My father became the Bavarian m inister for justice in 
Bavaria
. He 

opened up, or didn™t Œ did not forbid it, t he concentration camp of 
Dachau
, yes? 

And he was responsibl e for the unification of all the country laws int o the 
Reichs 

law. And t his was finished in November, December, 1934, one year later. And then, 

he was Œ he had Œ he had no work to do any more. So 
Hitler 
had hi m Œ let hi m be 
Reichsmi nister
. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. And, let™s see. So Œ and at one point in the book, you say that your 

mother was disturbed by 
K ristall nacht
, and you don™t gi ve much more informati on 
about that. Do you know why she would have been disturbed? 

A: No, the Œ because of her Jews. 

Q: Oh, her fur Jews.

Norman
. 
Norman 
was Œ 
Q: Oka y. Oh, cause he was old enough to Œ  
A: Œ m y father came back from 
Berlin
 Œ  
Q: Œ 
yeah, oka y.
 
A: Œ in the salon car. My Œ m y mother took i t as 
Norman
 picked him up in 
Munich
, and he Œ and she asked hi m, have you anything to do with this 
Reichs 
program Œ pogrom. Pogrom. 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: And he said, no 
Brigitte
, no. Well, this was just a lie, because he prepared it 

with all hi s speeches. 

Q: Sure. 
A: That something like this happened. 
Q: Sure, sure. Okay, okay. And then Œ so Œ and Œ and then you al so mention at one 

point that 
Frank
, obviously before the general government, wo
rked with 
Roland 
Freisler
, and if there™s any Œ any legal person that Americans know about during 

this period, and that™s not much, that™s for sure, it™s 
Freisler
, because of what 

happened 20
th
 of July, and all that. So, in what capacity did he Œ did he work with

Freisler
, and did he ha Œ do you remember hi m having a personal opinion about 
hi m, or Œ 

A: 
My 
Œ 
m y 
father founded the Academy for German Ri ght. It was also 
acknowledged by 
Hitler
, and it was public Œ something like university. Not 
univers
ity 
[indec iphera ble]
. So, therefore, he worked together with t he most 
important l awyers and judges. Al so, around the world, he alwa ys had some 

tagungen
.
