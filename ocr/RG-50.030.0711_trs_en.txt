Then, er, I mean, nothi ng , er, no th ing much happened th en , I can ™trememb er  

actually, we  actua lly moved u p  into  Belgiu m and e r , we  we ren ™t up  there  long , we  
came ba ck, and  we  spend mo st of our ti me in bl oom ing  Gr eece .An d the n , er, th ey

th
 I thin k it was in  1940 , the, e rm, the  order

tha t™s what th ey did, all the  electrician s and th in g slike  that, b u t er an ywa y... I stayed

da ys, and then they said , erm, a bo u t six days I suppose it wa s, an de r , th ey to ld me  
erm I could go ho me as well . 

So  weh ad to  wa lkd own  to the  er , the bea ch , ander  there  wa sn™t a  soul  an ywhere, 
then, and  all we got when we go t th e wa s 
some  blokes living in the, in  the sand 

du ne s waiting  fo r a boat to come  in, and the y erm, and after tha t a ll we go t was

trundling afte r himand  er, [M UMBL ES]
 
I ne ve r noticed an yone go tinjured  or

twiceas it vib rated so to  spea kan d er wh en I came  ou t couldn™t fi nd any bo mbing , 
the y had bombed  all the  factory, a ll th e woods and  had mi ssed  the factory

we  used to  snea k in aswell bu t we got tu rne d  ba ck on ce  or tw ice  by th e Germans

[DL ] Obviou sly you™re saying  therewasa differen cebetween the camp  youwere  in  
an d the other ca mp  in te rms of the  actual name . The naming of the  camp s. So, one 
be ing E715 and the other wh ich–
 
[BB] We ll,th eyboth had the sa mena me be cause whe n  I was in  the oth er camp it 
wa s E715  because I™ve  still got letters which I™ve  go t at home. We ll, which I™ ve  got

[DL ] We™ve a lready tou ched on  the soupwhich the Nazis supplied . Did the Na zis

rememb er what his na me isn ow. But he was in the South African a rmy but he was 

an  Englishman .  
 
[DL ] You say cond ition s were  ﬁveryg ood,ﬂ the do cuments show th at there  we re  
issues surrounding conditions within  the  hosp ital itself an d certainl y in  ter ms o f the  

Na zis coming  round  to en sure  that th ose  who they de emed fit to  work would the n  go 
to the factoryto work. Did  you find that in your experience?  
 
[BB] Well, wha t, we had a  sick list eve ry morning with h ow many he was allo wed to 
ha ve  o n  his sick list. But if his sick list didn™t me et the quantity he was allowed then 
on e or two bloke s who we ren™t sick used to join the list to make th e number up. But,

[DL ] Bu t was it a  con tinuous co lu mn  o f p eop le  th at we re  walking  past yo u for hours 
or days?
 
[BB] Oh, no, I think the y were smaller group s than that. The y went pa st us for 15 to 
20  minutes I suppose and that™ll be it a nd  th
en  la te r anothe r load wouldg o past and 
the y might b e b igger or smaller. We  ne ve r to ok mu ch  no tice o ther than to wond er

[DL ] And  what was th e feeling among you r fellow  POWs from E71 5  Auschwitz when 

you were  sen t on  th ismarch,wha t was theco lle ctive fee ling at that point?

be cau se we heard rumou rs th at Russian s had ,so me POWs  had go t do wn  th ere to  
the  Russian s and a ll the  Russians h ad  done is sho t them. Now whe ther tha t wa s true

likelywas bu t Ime tso me Ru ssians once inside the ca mp and I don™t kn ow what th ey 

were doing the re and the y obviously were (cou gh s) p risoners bu t they see med  to be 
ab le  to  wonder aro und  where th ey like d , the  same  as a  lot of the women Russian s. 
The y we re ab le  to  wonder around  wherever the y like . In fa ct, I didn™t g e t to kno w to
