Question:  This is the United States Holoca
ust Memorial Museum interview with Roberta 
Jones conducted by Margaret Garrett on May 
31st, 1997, in Silver
 Spring, Maryland. 
Tape 1, Side 1. Mrs. Jones, what wa
s your name at birth and your name now?
 
Answer:  Roberta Arlene Stubblefield (ph).
 
Q: And--
 
A: Oh, my name now?
 
Q: Your name now.
 
A: Roberta Stubblefield (ph) Jones.
 
Q: And what is your date of birth?
 
A: October 15, 1921.
 
Q: And where were you born?
 
A: St. Louis, Missouri.
 
Q: And you lived in St
. Louis for how long?
 
A: I --just a few months.  About six, I thin
k, then we moved to Po cahontas, Arkansas.
 
Q: And did you live in Pocahontas for awhile?
 
A: Yes.  For awhile.  Then we moved to 
Oklahoma for awhile, then
 we came back to 
Pocahontas until I gradua
ted from high school.
 
Q: And could you talk about you
r growing up and your family? 
 
A: Oh, yes.  I grew up in 
a--probably a lower-- incomewise, lower middle class, and 
during the Depression, then we were quite 
poor because of--because of the Depression, 
and--
 
Q: What did your father do?
 
A: My father did a little farming.  He had a 
grocery store, and that--I'll have to think 
about this just a minute here.  He had a little
 grocery store a time or two, did some 

farming, and then for awhile he
 worked for the WPA, if you 
know what that was.  Works 
Progress Administrati on.
 
Q: It was a government agency?
 

A: Yes.  One that Franklin Roosevelt establ
ished, which I think a lot of people in the 
North thought it was a very bad th ing to ha
ve, but the southern people thought it was a 
lifesaver.
 
Q: So that help
ed your family--
 
A: Oh, yes.
 
Q: --and he was able 
to work for them?
 
A: Yes, yes.  It was--saved their pride.  Th
at meant that they could get the jobs and work  
for the money and--
 
Q: Did you understand as a child what was 
happening, that Roosevelt had set this up and 
that enabled your father to have a job?
 
A: Oh, absolutely.  Abso
lutely.  And --because my father lo
st just about ev
erything in the 
--in the Depression.  Prior to that things 
were--were good, good e
nough.  And th en--when 
we moved back from Oklahoma to Arkansas, 
we were there about--there a few months, 
and someone set fire to our 
house, and they put it out afte
r--we weren 't there, we were 
visiting my grandmother, so they--and they  ex
tinguished--extinguished the fire after it 
had gutted one room, 
so then my father had that rebuilt.
 
Q: How old were you?
 
A: At--at this point I was nine or ten.
 
Q: And--
 
A: Probably  nine.
 
Q: And do you remember how 
you reacted to the fire?
 
A: To that one, not --not really, but just a 
few months later we were back visiting my  
grandmother again, and someone set it on fire 
again, and it burned to
 the ground, and we 
had nothing except wh at we had worn  to my
 grandmother's for the weekend.  That I 
remember 'cause I remember coming back
 and looking down  into  the base--in the 
basement --down into the 
ground which had been the 
basement and seeing my little 
wagon and--and it just hurt 'c ause all the toys 
were des--destroyed.  
Everything. Clothing, 
the whole bit.  And we never found out who 
did it or why but felt th
at the people who had 
lived in our house when  we 
were in Ok lahoma had made an enemy somewhere because 
we hadn't b een back bu
t just a probably by that time, maybe six months.
 
Q: So you th ink the people set it on fire 
thinking th ey were setting someone else's--
 
A: Thinking--
 

Q: --house--
 
A: --the house belonged to th
e people who had rented it from my dad.  So in addition to 
losing his job, he wo rk--he was a deputy sh
eriff in the --or so
mething like that in 
Oklahoma.  In addition to losing th at job, ha
ving to co me back to Arkansas without work , 
someone burned his house down, and he hadŠ
he did have a little fa
rm of 40 acres that 
we could move out to, but 
all together it was just blow after blow after blow.
 
Q: So as a child you had some tragedy--
 
A: We did.
 
Q: --in life?
 
A: But we had the most loving parents, a
nd two of the mo st l
oving sisters you could 
imagine, and we didn't know we were
 all that poor.  It was just a--
 
Q: What was your mo th er like?
 
A: A saint.  Not only  would I say that and 
my  sisters say that, but all of our friends 
thought she was wonderful.  Would love to 
come to our house because she was just 
wonderful.
 
Q: And your father?
 
A: He was wonderful too, but he was wonderful 
to our family, to us girls.  You know, we 
were just everything to him as we were 
to our mother, and he was --I could say as a 
father, he was perfect.  He didn 't reach out 
to the community the way my mother did, and 
my mother reached out 
to anyone who needed anything.  
As poor as we were, she was 
always giving of her time and whatever she ha
d to ev erybody else.  My father didn't  do 
that.  His was taking care of his family, and I could understand that 
 
'cause he had to take care of his family 
so in that respect, it was a great childhood.
 
Q: And you had two sisters?
 
A: Um-hum.
 
Q: And where were you in the birth order?
 
A: I was the youngest.
 
Q: So you were the baby?
 
A: Yes, um-hum.
 
Q: And what were your sisters like with you?
 
A: Wonderful.  Just wonderful.
 

Q: How much older were they?
 
A: The oldest one was five years ol
der, and the middle, two years older.
 
Q: So you were fairly close in age?
 
A: Fairly close and very close.  Still are. 
 Still very close.  Couldn't  do without them.
 
Q: And when did you star
t nursing school?  Was that right after high school?
 
A: Right after high school.  Probably a matte
r of six --six months after high school.  
Because --oh, that's w h en there was an openi ng in --went to Baptist 
Memorial Hosp ital in 
Memphis.  That's  when they had their ope
nings for students was six months after I 
graduated.
 
Q: And how did you happen
 to  decide you would 
go to nursing school?
 
A: Because my mother wanted me to.
 
Q: And why did she want you to?
 
A: Her father was a doctor.  My grandfathe
r's a doctor.  She had a brother who was a 
doctor and a nephew who was a doctor, and to he
r that was just the ultimate profession.  
We didn't have money for any of us to 
become doctors or--couldn't possibly even  
consider that, but for a nursing school, yes. 
 And at that time you had to even  buy your --
we had to  buy our books but, of course, they
 provided  the Œactually you wo rk ed your way 
through because you --your ro
om and board was provided, 
but you had to buy your 
books.  Noth ing was actually given to you and wo rked --
 
Q: It was hard?
 
A: Very hard.
 
Q: Did--did--you said that yo
ur mother wanted you to do it?
 
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: Did you feel strongly 
that you wanted to , or 
did you kind of go along?
 
A: I didn't, no, I wanted to--I would have lo
ved something in journalism.  I would have 
loved journalism, but you ju st didn't have a 
lot of choices during th e Depression.  You 

took wh at you could get and --and I didn't mind.
  It wasn 't  --she didn't force or anything, 
she just said that would be great.  She 
loved that so I thought well, might as well.
 
Q: And then  after you got into  nurse'
s training, did you like it or think--
 
A: It was all right.
 
Q: So it was okay?
 

A: Okay .  I'd rather have been in  journalism, but it was okay.
 
Q: And you knew y
ou could get a job.
 
A: Always.  Yes.  That was --oh, that was a tr
emendous factor at that
 time 'cause this was 
1940.  1940-1944 so still j
obs were hard to come by.
 
Q: So you finished training in what year?
 
A: 1944, I think.  Yes.
 
Q: So th at was during the war.
 
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: And then  what happened ?
 
A: At the begin --in January 1944.  Then I --ac
tually I applied to --I wanted to be a flight 
attendant. That's  not what we called them then
.  What'd we call them.  Stewardess.  And 
stewardesses at that time had to be nurses, so I remember I had a --had an interview set 

up at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, and it wa
s a --really looking forw
ard to it, and then 
people from my  hospital started going into  
the Services, mostly Army, and got very 
exciting about that time, and I decided that's  wh
at I wanted to do, so that's  what I did.  
Right from nursing school.  No experience.
 
Q: And--
 
A: I think I was 23.
 
Q: --did you have any ideas about wher
e you would be sent as a nurse or...?
 
A: I didn't have any idea, 
no, but I knew what I wanted.
 
Q: What did you want?
 
A: I wanted to go to Europe. 
 Wanted to go to Germany.
 
Q: And why did you wa
nt to go to Germany?
 
A: I--I'm not certain, but I imagine there wa
s a lot of probably excitement and glamor 
attached to that adventure b
ecause remember at that time, 
I'd just gotten out of nursing 
school.  Had no idea of what it was all a
bout.  22--or probably 23.  I had no idea.
 
Q: What--
 
A: Never regretted a minute of it, but I had no idea.
 
Q: You knew there was some danger.
 
A: Oh, yes, but at that age, it
's not --I'm not going to get hurt.
 

Q: Noth ing would happen to you.
 
A: Oh, no, huh-uh.
 
Q: So you signed up.
 
A: Um-hum.
 
Q: And then  what happened ?
 
A: Went to San An tonio, Te
xas.  And--oh, so--what did I do.  Signed up--this was all 
done by mail because then in 
Arkansas, now, it's all going 
through--I really don't know 
where. So I--I did sign up and received a co
mmission thro ugh the mail.  The funniest 
thing was I didn't  know I had a commi ssion.  Th
is is all just very strange to me, and I 
thought I'd got it when I--I thought I would ge
t it when I reached San Antonio for basic 
training, but actually I had it the minute that 
I received the assignment, and it was stran g e 
'cause I was on the train --we all had to sta
nd up on a train. There were no seats.  The 
trains were so full and there 
was a chaplain and a--and an  enlisted man and I sharing one 
seat.  The chaplain got 
it when he got on.  He was very ki
nd.  And he said we'll all--it was 
about eight hours from my  home to San An tonio. 
 He said, "We'll share this seat" so we --
we actually Œhave to stand until it
's our turn to sit in that one seat and --so as we were 
talking, they told me --this 
chaplain and this enlisted man 
had been in for awhile said, 
"You're already a second lieuten ant."  I thought
 that was very interesting. Anyhow --and 
they thought I was pretty naive so went on
 down to  San Antonio 
and took basic training 
there, and I can 't remember how much later but
 not long after that 
had orders for Camp  
Swift, Texas, with the 121st Semi-Mobile
 Evacuation Hospital was --I can 't remember 
the word for thatŠ activating. 
 Was activatin g.  So the do
ctors and nurses and corpsmen 
from --and administrative people from arou
nd the nation and--I think it's probably 
primarily up here in the --in the East were ga
thering at San Antonio to activate this tent 
hospital, and from there we went to New York . 
 After we were activated as a hospital, all 
of us were there, we went to New York by 
train. Everything's by train in those days, and 
stayed there a few days, and then at night --we
ll, no, there had to be as mu ch secrecy as 
possible then because we were going by sh ip 
to England, and they 
still had the U-boats, 
the Germans had U-boats in the 
Atlantic, so went by ship to
 England, and we had no idea 
where we were going, but I rememb er going 
onto the ship and th e blackout, comp lete 
blackout, and you --sudde
nly you were on th e ship.  It's al
mo st as if youdidn't really 
know you were boarding the ship; but there 
we were, and I think 
we left, maybe sailed 
the next morning and took us fi
ve days to get to England, 
and we were in England and --
and that --I believe we were waiting for the 
--when was D-Day? Do you remember what 
day that was?  I think we were waiting for --
no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or 

something.  We were waiting for some real h e
avy activity to loosen up a little so that we 
could cross the Channel and go to France. Stay
ed there a few days and then we started --

and then  we went to Luxembourg, and fro m Luxembourg I know one time another nurse 
and I and a docto r and a couple of corpsmen 
were sent to somewhere in Germany.  At 
that time ev erything was "somewhere."  No to
wn s could be listed or anything so this was 
somewhere in Germany wh ich from --and that from Luxembourg is a very, very  short 
distance, and we went in on
e little old --one little Army ambul
ance at night.  Of course it 
had been a blackout, and that 
was quite a trip because the --in a comp lete blackout, and 
they had --I guess--I don't know 
how they ran that ambulance 
but must have been very 
dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not
 much 'cau se anyway 
they came to a --a 
huge crater, bomb crater in the road, and the dr
iver had to stop just short of that because 
he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but 
he knew there was someth
ing there, and he got 
out--and he flashed --you had to  
flash your flashlights down to  the ground.  Never up or 
out but down to  the ground, and I reme mb er 
him flashing th at around to see how big the 
crater was so he could go ar
ound it; and down in a ravine by the road we heard these 
flashes of lights and heard some
 kind of firing, some kind of
 skirmishing down there, and 
we finally reached our destina
tion.  Then the next morning 
we were really balled out for 
having co me because it was so dangerou
s, but our co mmanding officer hadn't known 
that.  Somehow the communicati
ons hadn't been so good so  
we got to this --where we 
were detached to this very small outfit, and th
ey needed --they just needed  help  so badly.  
That's  why we were detach
ed there, and they  had a lot of German wounded too.
 
Q: Now, was this your first nursing activity?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: No, no, no, no.  No , we help
ed  in England, I'm 
sorry.  Should back 
up to England, but 
yes, in England we --we work
ed in a hospital there for a little
 while, and I can't remember 
how long, and those-those we
re --we had American casualtie
s from a big, big battle.  
That may have been --I can 't remember.  An
yhow it was very heavy fighting, big battle, 
very important fighting at that time, and we
 had many American casualties.  T h at's why 
we had to  stay in England awhile to take ca
re of them and wait for things to calm down a 
little bit in Germany and France
, so that--that was it until we
 rejoined our own hospital 
from this little--whatever that was.  It was 
not an evac hospital, smaller than that. 
 
Q: So in this littl
e, little hospital--
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: --there were a lot of German wounded?
 
A: And a lot of American wounded.
 
Q: A lot of American.
 

A: Uh-huh.  And--
 
Q: How was this for you as a very  young, 
inexperienced nurse to see all these war 
casualties?
 
A: I think we lived from day-
to-day.  I -- I -- I know at th
at time I had no th ought of the 
war ever ending.  Perhaps some people did, I 
don't know, but I think for the mo st part all 
of us were living just by the day because we 
didn't  know if we'd  be moving out the next 
day or what would happen because we di
dn't --we kept our patients --we were not 
supposed  to keep  them over 24 hours and then 
they were sent back to  the rear, so I think 
we lived essentially --everyt
hing was so fast, and perhaps 
we were moving so fast, 
everything happened  so fast that we didn't 
really think about tomo
rrow. Now, I'm sure 
that people who were moving our little hospital 
for us had to plan all of that.  You know, 
the logistics had to be tremendous, but the rest
 --the nurses and doctors and co rpsmen just 
lived for that time.
 
Q: Okay.  So then 
you were moved to--
 
A: We would follow where the fighting was,
 and that would be --well, we were 
advancing.  There was no retreating.  This wa
s toward the end of the war.  19--early part 
of 1944 so you see it was --no.  The end of 
1944.  So it was --the
 war was winding down-
-it was still very heavy fighting, but we were
 advancing constantly, 
and we were --so we 
had to move frequently , very frequently, a
nd it was --I d on't know how many times we 
moved, but it was --we'd always set up our 
tents in a field unless there might be a 
build ing handy that --that we co
uld set up in which would be a --a real help for a hospital 
because I remember, y ou know, a dog could 
wander through the ope
rating room in the 
tents, and that's just the way it was.  Set up 
in muddy ground.  No  fl
ooring, of course, for 
the tents.  Just mud or dry --just dirt
, whatever it happened to be at the time.
 
Q: And were you an op
erating room nurse or--
 
A: No, no, I was just --no, I ha
d just gotten out of --out of 
nursing school.  No, I was a--
general duty they called it.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Just --and as that you're put anywhere 
where you're needed.  
No specialty. So from 
there--at some point we were near--there --we
ll, we were attached--by this time we were 
attached to the Third Army, 
to Patton's Third Army, and we were somewhere near where 
Patton was, and I don't  really know wh ere that
 was, and it couldn't  
have been very far 
from the--Buchenwald, the concentration camp Buch enwald.
 
Q: Now, you were attached to --
 
A: Patton's Third Army .
 

Q: --Patton's Third Army
.  And your unit was?
 
A: The 121st Evacuation Hosp ital.
  A very small tent hospital.
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: So we were in --in --near
 Buchenwald, and Patton had be
en  there.  And Patton was a 
very tough old sold ier, and he wa
nted everyone to visit in that
 area, within that area to 
visit Buchenwald to see what 
was there so they'd  be --it wo
uld--become so furious.  The 
war's still going on.  Become 
so furious that--that it would make certainly better fighting 
men, determined, and I know our commanding 
officer thought it would not be the place 
for the women to --I think there were 30 or 33 of
 us women, very few of us.  He did not 
want us to go th ere, but Patton said everyon
e would go, no ex ceptions
, and so all of us 
had to go.
 
Q: So th at meant you didn't  do your nursing 
medical care during the time that you were 
going to --
 
A: It was just one day.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: No, we didn't  but that wo
uld have meant that other --we
 --I don't remember all that-- 
we would have had to  
have gone in shifts.
 
Q: Right, okay.
 
A: And I think I must have been on the first 
shift because I know we were told that--that 
the --the camp had been liberated
 three days before we got th
ere, so not very much --all 
they had --had been ab le to do was hand 
out food to --to the 
--to those who were 
surviving, and there were quite a few who were surviving, and they
 handed ou
t food.  
Noth ing had been  done as far as I can th
ink because the bodies were there.  The 
crematory was still there.  Gas ch amber, ev
erything was as it had 
been and Œand I'm 
having flashback s so --we went there on one --kindof a dismal day.  Had to have been in  
the spring.  Had no idea really 
--I mean you --you know, you've
 heard that this is going 
on, but --but you haven't known 
anyone who's seen it.  You 
haven't seen the pictures 
because it's just been
 liberated, just now getting people 
in and getting the pictures, and so 
when we arrived there, I can 't  remember that
 we even spoke to each other.  There were 
very few of us, so we had to 
have gone in shifts.  Very fe
w of us, and I can't rememb er 
even speaking to  anybody because it was such 
a shock; but nobody 
broke down  and wept 
or had hysterics, and I don't know
 if part of that was the tr
aining you've had as a medical 
group or not, but I just remember silence, a
nd the shock is incredib
le and you --perhaps 
walk through in a bit of a da
ze because who can --who can assi
milate to all of this.  You 
can't. And we were shown thro ugh the camp .  I don't rememb er by whom.  Probably --

probably some of the soldiers
 who had liberated them, I'm not sure, but we were shown 
through the camp around the gr
ounds, and the inmates who we
re there were still dressed 
in their striped uniforms and 
so happy, so filled with joy and trying so hard to do 
anything they could for us, and I think --I 
could be wrong herebut I think it was both 
American and British who liberated Buchenwald
, but I'm not certain, but all I saw were 
American soldiers there.  And we went 
thro ugh th e barracks, and you want me to 
describe the barracks?
 
Q: Um-hum.
 
A: They were wooden buildings, 
not very large at all, and they had --these were just for 
sleeping, and th ey had bunk beds, as I reme mb
er it, four high with just a few inches 
between each two bunks 
so that you --you just knew --the
re was just no way a --a person 
could turn over in th e bunk.  Fo
r them to change their positi
on to tu rn over, 
I'm sure they 
had to slide out and start again.  Just a --jus
t probably the head cleared.  I think that was 
about all to get four bunks hi
gh.  And that just seemed te
rrible to us, you know, with no 
mattresses or things like that, 
none of the comforts. And there was one --we went thro ugh 
one of the barracks, and there were two men th
ere still in their striped uniforms, and they 
were --you'v e heard the expression "skin and bone
s."  Well, in this ca
se for these inmates, 
that was literal.  Absolutely literal.  And 
they had been given so
me black bread by the 
 
Americans I'm sure, an d they wa
nted to share it with us. Now, had we been older, mo re 
mature, we would have 
accepted as their guests because wh
o had they been able to share 
with or had anything to share 
with?  Or even talked with 
freely, but we thought how can 
we take their bread?  That's a ll they had.  And we refused.  Later I th ought had I been 
older, mo re mature, I would have handled it di
fferently, but we did re
fuse that. Then we 
were shown the --at some point the cremator
ia --crematoria --I guess--is it crematory or 
crematorium?
 
Q: Either one.
 
A: With the bodies and, you know, ready 
to be cremated.  We were shown the gas 
chambers and th e stacks of bod
ies, naked bodies so high 
and the carts or wagons filled 
with them in addition to the 
stacks on the ground all around. 
Then we were taken to one 
of the Nazi administrator's offices, probably
 a commanding office, I'm not sure, and they  
pointed out this lamp  shade made out of hu
man skin, and it was a terrible thing.  I'm 
about to cry.
 
Q: Do you want to stop for a minute?

Beginning of File Two
 
Q: Tape 1, Side 2. 
So you said that you 
saw other camps also?
 
A: Yes.  We --the war was over in the --ma
ybe May 8th, I think, something like but we 
didn't  come home right then, and we --we we
nt --but our --we had no mo re American 
soldiers.  Of course the fighting was over so be
ing the kind of hospital we were, we didn't 
keep patients, therefore, we were just waiting 
until we got orders.  In
 fact, we had orders 
to go to China.  We never went because 
the war was over there too, was winding down, 
was over there shortly after that. S o  we went
 to --can't remember. 
 I think somewhere --
we were the first hospital across the Danube,
 so I think--o r somewhere along the Danube, 
and we one day went to another concen trati
on camp , a smaller one, and I don't  know th e 
name of this one or where it was, but I do re
memb er it was a cold and rainy day, and we 
went to the --for some reason 
we went to the administrati
on building.  At the time we 
went there, I believe there were three of us 
nurses and the chief nurse, she went there for 
some reaso n , we went along with
 her, and we happened  to be 
at the time that they were --
that the Americans had this cam
p, they were issuing clothing
 to the inmates. There again 
they had their striped unifo rms.  I suppose be
cause they were issui
ng--we were issuing --
the Americans were issuing clothing, there ca
me th e men  so rt o f in  a co lu mn  comin g  in  
to get their clothing, and they were stark na
ked, not a stitch on them.  They came in 
where we --three or four women were, and they
 smiled, and they acted as if th ey were 
clothed, _____+ clothes.
 And we had to lo ok at them as 
if they were clothed, smile at 
them and, of course, we didn't speak German
, they didn't speak English but, you know, 
the --probably some handling wh
ich--you know, all that -- 
as if nothing had happened , 
and we were told that these were political 
prisoners; that some of the best minds in 
Germany were probably th
ere, but they were not politically
 correct, and ye
t what grabbed 
my  attention was that these men didn't seem to
 be aware --of course 
they were aware they 
didn't  have clothes on, but they  didn't seem 
somehow to acknowledge that.  Some of the 
big brains in Europe.  We only spent a shor
t time there, but that never left me, that 
impression.
 
Q: Were you there to do nursing or--
 
A: No.
 
Q: --somebody thought that you should see it or...?
 
A: No.  Yes, I really can 't remember that but a 
lot of this thing-- this kind of thing, I think 
you probably try to forget.  I 
know we were --there were about three of us nurses there 
with --probably all lieutenants 
or something, younger nurses
 there with our chief nurse, 
and she was just a captain 'cause we had su
ch a small o u tfit, and she was probably on 
some admi nistrative mission, I don't know, but
 we didn't --we didn't do anything.  We 

were just there with her, and --but that's what
 impressed me to thin
k that these minds had 
regressed to that point.
 
Q: So so mething had really been done 
to them to almost
 dehumanize them.
 
A: Abso lutely.  And there again 
skin and bones was the literal 
thing.  I mean they were --
the --the skin was just absolu
tely against their bones, a
nd their eyes were--I would say 
expressionless, and yet they --they --they were 
glad to be alive beca
use they were free.  
That probab ly doesn 't make a lot of sense, but
 you --you knew th ey were glad to be alive 
and they were free and that--tha
t they'd  been through horrors 
that--that they couldn't  even 
describe I'm sure.  That was the second cam
p. And th e third one was probably th e wo rst, 
and that was somewhere near --
it was in Austria near  --oh, gosh.  I could look it up, but 
it's probably not important.
 
Q: Well, I can stop the tape
 if you want to look it up.
 
A: Well, it's probably-- 
 
Q: I'll just stop the tape and you can look it up.
 
A: All right.
 
[Tape recorder
 turned off]
 
Q: You were looking up --you were looking up
 the name of the third camp, or where the 
third camp was.
 
A: Yes.  And I don't know the 
name of it.  It was a --it w as in an old German Luftwaffe 
camp.  In fact, some o f their 
planes were still on the ground.
 
Q: You said it was near Linz, Austria?
 
A: Yeah, near Linz, Austria.  And that-- in
 that one, the women 
did not--did not do any 
work, didn't  --because they were
 afraid the women would be 
attacked by the inmates, but 
our men --the men from our hospital went in a
nd cleaned up this place because it had just 
been liberated too, so  we were stationed th
ere for some time while 
--while the men in our 
unit cleaned it up, took care of --set up the ho
spital, took care of the sick, and the women 
were--we were separated, I think, just by a fenc
e, just by a fence, 'c
au se I  re memb er a t all 
fence.  Of course the fence had been built by 
the Germans to keep th
e inmates in but also 
kept us separated from them, and we were th
ere a few weeks probably, and there were so 
many children and so  many of these were French
.  Probably most of them were French, 
but there were children of all ages there, a
nd I reme mb er we would--maybe a couple of 
us nurses would go for a little walk around 
the compound and, of course, we couldn't go 

far but just go around the compound, and th es
e children would line up around the fence.  
They  weren't allowed out, and they  too were ab
solutely skin and bones
.  No --no flesh, no 

mu scle that you could see, just
 --just skin and bones. They'd
 line up at the fence looking 
at us, and we might have a bit of chocolate or
 something with us, a
nd you'd want to give 
it to them, or fruit, whatever, so badly.  Anyt
hing you had.  But we were told --we were 
threatened, I suppose, can 't give them anyt
hing because it w
ould have killed them.  They 
were just on liquids for several days, then they
 would graduate to a soft diet, then regular 
food. And one night wh en we we
re there, it w as very --very 
striking, very impressive.  
Some of our big cargo planes, American cargo planes came--now the war is over -- came 
in to take these --the French 
people back to Paris, and they
 were so thrilled, so excited 
about going home that they 
took ev erything that was ma de of wood from the barracks, 

put it in a huge, huge pile.  I don't know how ma
ny feet high.  Just as high as they could 
stack it.  Set it afire after dark and sang "The
 Marseille."  That was impressive.  Very, 
very wonderful time fo r them.  And after that
 there --there was --we just waited to get 
orders to come back home.  There were no mo
re camps, b u t we stayed in that one camp 
until we left to come home.
 
Q: And now wh at was your assignment in the camp?
 
A: We had no assignment because 
we weren't allowed in the camp.
 
Q: Oh.  So you weren't--
 
A: The women.
 
Q: --doing any nursing or a
ny work.  That was just--
 
A: Not th e women.
 
Q: --a holding --
 
A: Hold ing.  Yet--
 
Q: --for the women while the men --the men were inside-- 
 
A: That's right.
 
Q: --working and 
you were just waiting until--
 
A: Until--
 
Q: Until they finished?
 
A: Until they finished and got 
the camp cleaned up and got the 
patients into some sort of 
shape that they could leave th em.  The patients I say, the in mates, and then we came back 
home.
 
Q: How was it for you to come back from that to home?
 

A: You know, then at that time you weren't e
xpected to  have any emotions.  The hospital 
--the people --the hospital personnel was not expected to have an
y emotion because you 
had to do all you could to help those w
ho --who had --who were tr
aumatized, and I don't 
think any of us were ever considered to be
 traumatized.  I guess you weren't allowed to 
be, and there was --and I can 't  even remember
 discussing this with
 any of--any of the 
other nurses or docto rs or corpsmen who were
 there. It was just --you saw it and that was 
it.
 
Q: And after you came back home, 
you didn 't talk about it either?
 
A: Hum-um.  No.  Nobody ta
lked about it.  You might --y
ou might say a little bit now 
and then.  I know to my --y
ou know, after I had my childre
n, they got older, I did tell 
them, and once in awhile now I'll tell some
body a little bit about it, but it was something 
that wasn't discussed, and no
w I think it's entirely differe
nt.  They  encourage discussion 
and --and it is therapeutic, but then no.
 
Q: So you told your children a 
little bit about it, but you never--
 
A: I probably told them a lot.  I proba
bly told  them a lot when th ey got older.
 
Q: Because you thought it was impor
tant for them to know that--
 
A: Abso lutely.
 
Q: --you--
 
A: Abso lutely.  I wanted
 them to know that.
 
Q: Why did you want them to know?
 
A: Because my generation is the last gene
ration that had the --the firsthand contact, 
firsthand knowledge, and I know that there 
are people who believe it never happened , and 
I think there will be more who will refuse to
 believe it ever happened, and I think it's 
wonderful what the Ho
locaust Museum--the re
cords they are keepi
ng of this because I 
think it mu st be, mu st be kept for history, fo
r the future generations, and I think it's great 
you're getting th e interviews now because it--m
y --well, I say my  generation is the last.  
Of course the children of the inmates in
 the concentration camp will have some 
memo ries.  That's  the next generation, but 
probably  there are not too many of them and 
so I think it's very important.
 
Q: So what was it like for you after you came 
back to the States?  
Did you stay in the 
Army  for awhile, or were you discharged?
 
A: I stayed in the Army for 
awhile.  Not very long.  Well,
 maybe a couple of years, 
something like that.  And th
en I got married and got out.
 

Q: So you got out b
ecause you got married?
 
A: Um-hum.  Yes.
 
Q: How was it being in the Army those 
two years when you came back home?
 
A: It was --well, I was --actually we had mo
stly men from--not men and wo men, but men 
from the--  from the--E
urope, from the war --well, from th
e --from the Pacific too.  These 
were the patients we had so it's
 still family and--because you 
were sort of family with the 
patients of those who had been th ro ugh the 
same thing that you ha
d and had seen wh at 
you had seen, so it wasn't --I don't know
, it was just a continuation somehow.
 
Q: And in th at circumstance, people didn't ta
lk much about what 
they'd  been through?
 
A: No.  No .  The men who had been --thos
e who may have been --may have been 
through Africa, Italy, and Germany,
 terribly wounded, severely ____+
 
Q: Do you reme mb er whether you thought ab out --about it, what you had been  thro ugh 
and the condition that some of them were in?
 
A: Oh, yes.  We thought about 
it.  We just didn't talk about 
it.  And I don't know why, but 
the --the men --saw a lot of those patients, sa
w a lot of them, and no
w they're --now we'r e 
in a stationary general hosp
ital where you keep  your patients 
so you get to know these 
patients and you're with them for weeks.
 
Q: And you go throu
gh a lot with them.
 
A: Go through a lot with them
 'cause they were terribly 
wounded. The hospital where I 
was, one of them was in California.  It was 
plastic surgery, and these were mo stly burned 
patients.  Terribly burned with
 much rehabilitation. In fact, we were in --we were in 
Pasadena, in the McCornack General Hospital 
in Pasadena, California, which --and at 
that time Pasadena was populated by mo stly 
retired, very wealthy people, and they did 
not want our patients in their restaurants, on 
their streets.  Anywhe
re.  They  didn't want 
them out of the hospital because they were --t
hey didn't  want to see them because they 
were too --too badly wo unded.  
Too disfigured, terribly disf
igured.  So much --so many 
had burned faces, and --a
nd they were re-making their f
aces, reconstructing, and they 
didn't  want them in their restaurants. Now,
 on one hand, it would be
 hard to go into a 
restaurant and sit --sit next to th ese patie
nts. On th e other hand, these people had 
defended them, and we were ve
ry angry.  The nurses and doctors were very angry about 
it, and we'd  go out with them because the --t
he men were too embarrassed to go out with 
anyone but hospital personnel, so the nurses 
would go out with them and --and maybe to 
--to a restaurant wh ere they had dancing after 
and that sort of thing. And at that time I 
could not understand how anybody could treat 
them so cruelly but no
w I see, maybe they 

did have a little bit of a point 
because it would be very hard
 for them to face, for the 
civilians to face if they 
hadn't been exposed to it.
 
Q: But it was tough for you at 
the time to see that happening.
 
A: Hurt very, very much 'cause th ese --the
se men were our --our 
--in addition to  being 
our patients, they were good friends
.  Very good friends, and yes, it hurt.
 
Q: So you were at the Army hospital in
 Pasadena, and where else did you serve?
 
A: Texas.  Louisiana.
 
Q: What --what was the hospital in Texas?
 
A: Oh.  Camp Swift.  The hos
pital.  Hospitals all have na
mes.  I ca n 't re memb er th at 
name.  And Camp Polk in Louisiana.
 
Q: Did you meet your husband in the military ?
 
A: Uh-huh.  I met him in California.  I met 
him at --in Pasadena.  He was in the Army .
 
Q: Was he--
 
A: In x-ray.
 
Q: Oh, so he was assi
g n ed to the hospital?
 
A: He was in x-ray.  Then got out of the Ar
my , and I didn't --didn't do any mo re nursing.  
I guess I just did another year when  the Ko r
ean War broke out in 19
50, and we were in 
Michigan.  I was in a hospital for 
a year treating Korean War casualties.
 
Q: Now, you were in th e Army or--
 
A: No.
 
Q: As a civilian?
 
A: I was a civilian then.
 
Q: So you were a civilian 
working in an Army hospital.
 
A: In an Army hospital for a year, and 
that was the end of my  nursing career.
 
Q: And you previously had stopped
 nursing wh en you got married?
 
A: Uh-huh.  For about two years I guess.  Yes,
 I think that was two years it was, and the 
Korean War broke out, and we 
went to Percy Jones  Hosp ital 
in Michigan, and they were 
desperate for civilian nurses, any kind of
 --you know, Army nurses, civilian nurses, 
whatever they could get, and th
ey got all the civilian nurses 
they could get in addition to 
the Army nurses.
 

Q: So did your husband also 
work in the Army hospital--
 
A: Um-hum.
 
Q: --when you were there?
 
A: Um-hum.  He was a master sergeant in --
maybe not at that time.  He was a master 
sergeant in  x-ray, and he was in charge 
of the --I guess the master serge --the enlisted 
men in charge of x-radiology.  I'm missi
ng that somehow, but anyhow he was --he was 
always in radiology.
 
Q: Did he stay in the Army?
 
A: He retired.
 
Q: After you got married?
 
A: Uh-huh.  He retired and--
 
Q: He retired when from the Army?
 
A: Goodness me .  After 24 years and that was-- 
 
Q: Oh, I see.  So after you were 
married, he continued in the Army ?
 
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Then--he retired here from Walter Reed.
 
Q: So th at's  how you got to the Washington area?
 
A: That's h o w we came to the Washingt
on areA:  Been here for many years.
 
Q: Was he overseas at all?
 
A: No.  He didn't  go overseas.
 
Q: So he didn't have the 
war experience that you had.
 
A: No, he didn't.
 
Q: Did you ever talk
 with him about it?
 
A: Very --no, I didn't  really.  I guess maybe not at all perhaps.
 
Q: Do you keep in to uch with an y of 
the people that you were overseas with?
 

A: Yes, I did --not now.  I did, oh, for ye
ars, I did with two.  Two special people.  
Actually three.  Three.  An
d then, you know, our --our path
s have diverged an d, oh, one 
of them is dead, and I did keep 
in contact with her until she died.
 
Q: So ev en thou
gh you didn't talk ab
out it, you were in contact with people--
 
A: Um-hum.
 
Q: --who had been through 
wh at you had been through?
 
A: Yes.  We never mentioned it.  And--and 
I --now I find that strange.  I never felt it 
strange, but now I do find th at really strange
.  We never mentioned it.  So I don't know 
where any of them are now, and --and I'm su re
 some --I know this 
one is dead, perhaps 
some others.  Because I was actually next 
to the youngest in th
e group of nurses.  
Therefore, if I'm 75, they would be older.
 
Q: So do you th ink mu ch or some or at
 all about those experiences overseas now?
 
A: Quite a bit.  I suppose everyone does quite
 a bit.  You know, you don 't rea l ly get hung 
up on it, but you'll have these flashbacks 
and --or something will 
remind you of what 
happened then and --yeah
.  So I guess I do think about it quite a bit.
 
Q: Do you think that it ch
anged you in  any way to ha
ve gone thro ugh all that?
 
A: You know, I never thought so.  I never thou
ght so, and yet my  son one day said to me, 
he said, "You know, Mom" --he knew someone at
 work, some woman, and she said her 
mo ther had simi lar experiences, and she thought 
"I think it 's affected my  mo ther.  I don't 
know how, and he said, "And 
I said to her, you know, it probably  did my  mo ther too."  I 
didn't  ask him how.  Just --I stay off that s
ubject.  So I don't think it --I never thought it 
did.  Maybe it did.
 
Q: Well, it's hard to know what it would ha
ve been like if you hadn't have done that 
'cause--
 
A: Yes.  May have been  the very  same.  
Who knows but it was an experience that you 
could well do without. I had a woman one time 
tell me that she di
dn't think it ever 
happened , and I don't know why 
she said that.  We weren't ta
lking about it, but she said 
that she didn't believe that there were ever
 any concentration camps.  She thought that 
was a lot of propaganda, and I--I
'm thinking you're talking 
to the wrong person, and she 
talked quite a bit about it until 
I finally just stopped her and told her whatever --I don't 
remember what I told he
r, but anyhow I told her the truth.  I was shocked.  That shocked 
me as mu ch as anything probab ly to think 
that somebody --she was older than I, so she 
had been through --in the Stat
es.  She had known wh at wa
s going on.  I mean she had 
heard --she had to have heard.
  No way she could have avoi
ded newspapers, radios, what 
was going on, and yet she thought
 that was all propaganda.
 

Q: How did she take 
it when you told her?
 
A: Well, I felt that she didn't  
believe a word of it.  Then no t long ago, I met a woman and 
she was Œ and I don't --I don't know why th e s
ubject came up, but she was telling me that 
her father-in-law --I don't know, someone, someone
 in her family did 
not believe it ever 
happened .  Was propag anda.  So again someone
 else didn't believe it, and then I --that 
makes me  believe there might be a lot of 
people that believe this never happened, 
therefore, the story has to be told, has to 
be kept because I can't  imagine there'd be 
anyone who would think it hadn't happened .  I 
know th ey're teaching it in the schools 
today, and there --they --I think they 're teachi
ng it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are 

those who don't believe, and I can
't --apparently they don't want
 to believe it.  Why don't 
they want to believe?
 
Q: Hard to understand.
 
A: Um-hum.  Have you heard that th
ere are people wh o don't believe it?
 
Q: Oh, yes.
 
A: And why do they  not believe it, do you know?
 
Q: I don't know.  Hard to
 --it's hard to understand.
 
A: So do you th ink if these people--those 
people who do not belie
ve would go through 
the museum, the Holo caust museum, they'd  still not believe?
 
Q: I don't know wh ether they wo uld or not,but I think your testimony's a very important 
piece of documenting 
that it did happen.
 
A: Thank you.  There are lots of us out he
re I'm sure.  L o ts of books are being written 
now too.
 
Q: Yes, there are.  Is there anyt
hing else that you would like to say?
 
A: I don't think so.
 
Q: Anything that I've
 forgotten to ask you?
 
A: I --I don't think so.  No, I don't belie
ve that--would have 
nothing do with the 
concen tration camps so I don'
t think th ere is anything.
 
Q: Well, that's all right.  If there's something 
else that you want to say.  Doesn't have to 
be directly connected.
 
A: It would just be experiences that--that wo
uld have no bearing on
 it so I think it's 
probably  unimportant as far as this goes.
 
Q: Experiences in the war?
 

A: Um-hum.  Would have no bearing on --o
n --on the --well, it would have had some 
bearing on the Nazis.  
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: Do you want something-- 
 
Q: If you want to.
 
A: --or just want to hang arou
nd?  Oh, I found it very intere
sting that we--oh, I shouldn't 
say interesting.  That's not--not a good descri
ption.  Exciting.  And something I was glad 
to do that we didn't --we --o
f course you heard about Du nkirk.
 
Q: Um-hum.
 
A: We were set up in Germany when some of
 the men who were captured at Dunkirk, 
this is five years later, had 
been prisoners of the German
s all this time.  Not in a 
concen tration camp but a prison camp.  Were 
liberated.  Came back through our hospital 
for just a few hours 'cause we were still this li
ttle tent in the field, and all very --had been 
wounded seriously and ha
d --had very little care given.  
Desperately needed care.  But 
they weren't interested 
in that so much as we
 were the first Englis
h-sp eaking women they 
had seen in five years, and they  wanted to 
know what was going on in England, and --and 
we were so happy and --oh, they
 were probably ther
e a couple of hours befo re they went 
back to the --to the rear, and it was 
just exciting to talk with them.
 
Q: And to see how ex cited they were.
 
A: Oh, yes.  Yes.  Uh-huh. 
 And th ey had heard that the 
--they had just heard--because 
they got no news in the prison camps, no lette
rs from home.  Nothing.
  They had no idea 
what was going on in England,
 but they had just heard that
 the American soldiers were 
marrying all of the English women and that was 
a terrible thing for them to have to hear, 
and we were happy to  tell them not so.  So 
then  they went on back
 to England I'm sure 
very quick ly.
 
Q: Well, you mu st have had days
 and days of very dreary  times
 so to have something like 
that happen would certainly--
 
A: Be --
 
Q: --give you a different mood.
 
A: Yes, yes.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: Yes, it was.  And I think th at's
 probably  all that I have to say.
 

Q: Okay .  Well, I want to thank you very 
much for giving your testimony.  It's very 
important for the museum to have this.
 
A: Thank you.  You're very welcome.
