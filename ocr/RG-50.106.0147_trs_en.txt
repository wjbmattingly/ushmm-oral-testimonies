Margitta Cooper
 conducted by 
Gail Schwartz
 on

th
, 2002 at the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape 
number one, side
 A. 
What is your full name? 
Answer: Including mai den a -- 
Margitta Granberg Gru
nberg Cooper.
 
Q: And where were you born and when were you born?  

A: I was born June the 10
th
, 1929 i n 
Speyer
, Germany
. 
Q: Let™s tal k a little bit about your family. Tell  me about your parents and their 

background, how l ong they had been there. 

A: My father was one of the religious leaders in the town, he was also the cantor 

cum rabbi. He was born in 
Poland
. My mother was 
a 
-- a young woman who 
married -- in her da y, who could -- never had a career, of course, she married from 
her mother™shouse, m
arried m y father. He had been married before, he was a young 
widower, as a matter of fact, when she marri ed him. She 
--
 how they met  I never 
knew because there was some romantic st ory that she had gone to visi t a friend and 

he met her and he fell i n love with her. I don™t  know, I™m sure that™s about it. 

Probably a blind date. Anywa y, they marri ed, the y had one child, who died. My 

sister died when she was 10 years old, which was a devastating event for m y

parents. And, as a matt er of fact, if it had not been for the death of my sister, I 
probably -- m y brot her and I woul d not have been born -- we were t wins. So in 

considering m y father and his phi losophy, he -- it had to be somewhat ironic for hi m 

to have lost a child and then have t wins born. At any rate, that™s how we arrived, and 

I think we had a n -- very nice life, a very nice home. Stable. I mean, I felt no 
anxiety or fear, at least not until I was about five years old, when it became more 
difficult to be a Jew in 
Germany
 and I thi nk t hat™s an old story. And the children, I 
think, more than the adults, began to react t o m y brother and I as Jews, even though 

there were still children who were not Jewish, Christian children who would pla y 

with us, because there was a park i n front of our home. I had Jewi sh friends. I was a 

child that had -- m y brother and I 
--
 
more m
-me, because m y brother was very well 
behaved. I always had the feeling that I had to be very well  behaved. I was a speci al 
child because of my fat her and certai n conduct  was expected of me, so that was 
difficult. It was a very religious home. My father was a reli g -- i-i-in -- in the sense 

that it was strictly Orthodox. 
My mother was, Ithink 
-- 
I don™tknow how
 sh -- 
exactly what her beli efs were, but certainly she -- she upheld whatever m y father 

wanted to do in a -- in 
--
 in the marriage. She was a very nervous woman because of 
m y sister™s death. I think that was a terrible trauma for her. So when I think of what 

ultimately happened to my mother, it™s unbearable to think that t his woman who had 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

-- ended up her life the way it event ually di d. And that I find probabl y the most 
unforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in 
Germany
. And let 
me sa y now, at the outset, that what happened in 
Germany
, whil e it was unique in 
the history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great  battles and great 

suffering among ot her peoples of the worl d, I have come t o the concl usions after 
many, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in 
Germany
 could 
happen anyplace, gi ven certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly 
inappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, thi s is -- these are 

the people t hat were able to do it. I think all peoples are capable of doing it. 

Q: What were your parents™ names? 

A: My mother™s name was 
Anna Rosenthal Greenberg. 
She was born 
Irena 

Bayata, 
but the y called her 
Anna
. My father was 
Benjamin Greenberg 
and the y 
called hi m 
Benno Greenberg
.  
Q: And -- and your brother™s name? 

A: My -- 
m y brother™s namewas 
Heinz
 and he was m y twin and he now lives in 
Florida
 and he™s a grandfather. So I mean, you know, it™s wonderful, when you 

think about that.  

Q: And tell me a lit tle bit about your late sister. What was her name and what did 

she die of? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

A: My -- 
m y sister™sname was 
Margot 
and she was absol utely exqui site, I have a 
picture of her. She was angelic. Not only because she died, because people become 
angelic after they™re dead, but from -- everybody said that  she was just a sweet and 

gentle child. And her death not only devastated m y parent s, but I think m y mother™s 

brothers, her uncles and m y -- m y grandmother, and I thi nk that 
--
 she was really 
beautiful. I mean, she looked like the 
Rosenthals. 

Q: 
Wh a
- What did she die of? 
A: 
Diphtheria. 
She was fine. They had sent her to 
Switzerland 
to reco -- 

recuperate, and I think from what now that  -- I was in the medical fiel d a little bit  for 

-- for a long ti me, she 
--
 I think they must have given her 
digitalis
 to strengthen t he 
heart, and I t hink the y o -- overdosed and I thi nk it killed her. She was only 10 years 

old. So I t hink that™s precisely what  happened, although, you know, it  was so long 
ago, I mean, was 1928, so it™s difficult to -- but the y did bring back the body from 
Switzerland --
 it had t o be a -- a frightful event for my parents. And -- but as I said, 

you know, my chi ldhood was pret ty normal. I was -- 
af
ter the -- do you want to hear 
this?  

Q: W
ell, let me ask you a little bit  more before we get to the --  
A: Yeah.  

Q: -- the -- t o the -- the 30™s --  

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

A: Yes.  
Q: -- or the mid-30™s. What kind of neighborhood did you live in, was it a Jewi sh 

neighborhood, or a mixed neighborhood? 

A: Mm-hm. It was a Jewish neighborhood. It was a very nice neighborhood, you 

know, each house was individual, had land around it.  
Q: You were right i n the center of the city? 
A: Not really. I would have thought it was more -- it was not a big -- I mean 
Speyer
 
is -- is -- 
it w
as a fairly well known city, it  had a very famous cathedral and it had 

the 
Speyer
 
Diet
..there was somet hing wi th 
Luther
 that was there, too. I think i t was 
more toward the outskirts. It was a very residential area and there were lots of Jews 

living in t hat area. There were some Christ ians too, but they would have been across 

the park. And there was a beautiful church not  too far from us and then there were a 
cluster of homes there, too, that I t hink bel onged to Christian families. But where I 
lived, our neighbors were Jewish. The interesting thing was that maybe 20 yards 

from us, around the corner, was what is known as a -- it was like, not barracks for 

soldiers, but like a building that housed soldiers. You know, arm y sol diers, not 
SS
 or 
Nazi. And t hat was 
v ery 
-- that was strange, because i-it -- right in -- in this area the y 
had what is called a -- 
a 
-- I don™t remember what it was called i n 
Germany
 -- in 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

German, but the y had soldiers living there, trai ning, being trained there. So I used to 
watch them when I was little, and we -- they were very friendly then. 

Q: You had mentioned extended family. Di d you have qui te a bit of relatives, 

cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents? 

A: I had a grandmother who lived in 
Gimbsheim
, where my mot her was 
-- where 
m y mother
 was born. My mother had two brothers. One was a bachelor all his life 

and came to the 
United States
 in t he late 30™s, 1939. And she also had a younger 

brother who was marri ed and I had one cousi n. And then there were various assorted 

second cousins. My mother -- m y grandmother was widowed when she was like, i n 
her late 20™s, from -- you know. And -- but she had a brot her who came to this 

country as a young man. Now, I have family that live in
 Wichita, Kansas
, too. So, I 

mean, you know, i t™s the old story about emigration and -- and -- and families and 
intermarriages and -- and -- but we -- we -- it was nice. I 
--
 I -- it was a nice -- 
it was 
-- it was a nice -- it was a nice life for a child and certainly it had t o be for my 
parents, you know, because the y had a position in the community and -- and that  wa 

-- that was 
--
 

Q: You said your father was a cant or, was t hat  his full ti me work? 

A: Work, yeah, plus he was educating all t he young -- youngsters. He also educ -- 

you know, he also had classes. He also trai ned all the boys for their 
B ar Mitzvahs
, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

plus he had Sunday School, that he ran. So that™s why I™m sa -- once -- th-t
hat™s why 
I said initially, m y problem was that I alwa ys had to be on such good behavior, 

because of hi m. 

Q: How would you describe yourself? Were you an independent chil d? 

A: I think t he word brat would probably come to mind. Independent. Wel l, I -- I 
think the one thing I -- that I learned and that I love, and I think that made it much 
easier to cope with me is I loved t o read. And once I discovered books, I think I was 

easier to cope with. Before that, I -- I didn™t  understand what I di d that made it -- 

made me alwa ys get  int o trouble, but I did, you know. And m y mother would sa y, 

Margit, 
please stand up, 
Margit
, please sit still. You know, the usual things, you 

know, that children do. 

Q: Were yourparent s Zionists? 
 
A: My father I am su -- I didn™t understand what Zionism was, but certainly he 

believed in the state of i -- of i -- not -- 
at
-
at  
-- 
Palestine
, absolutely, because I heard 
hi m talk about that . They were firm believers that Jews had to have a place to go. 

And he was very, very much aware of what was happening in 
Germany
, because he 
told my 
-- m y mot her™s brothers both to get out, and they listened to him. He coul d 
not leave, t he y would not let hi m. 
Q: We™ll tal k about that also in a little while -- 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

A: Yes, sure. 
Q: I just wanted to go more into your own personal life. 

A: Mm-
hm, yes.
 
Q: You sai d you l iked t o read, any other hobbies that you had? 

A: Now?  
Q: N-No, when you were a child. 
A: Oh. I read, I played. But I would think that reading was my great passion, alwa ys 

and still is. 

Q: What about sports? 

A: I wasn™t very good. I mean, let me put it to you this wa y, when they would 

choose people to pl a y, after everybody else was chosen t he y™d say, well, we™ll t ake 

her, you know? That was the final choice, nobody really wanted me. But I -- it 
didn™t bother me because I-I loved it, even though I was so bad at  it. I mean, I 
played badly, but I loved doing it  and I was always thrilled wh
en they evenwould 

include me. So that  was -- sports was not my forte, no.  

Q: Did you have a special relationship wit h your twin brother?  

A: Y-Y -- no. Yes and no, we fought a lot . Oh, I did te -- take viol in and all that 

stuff. You know that my father was very musi cal and had a wonderful voice and he 

played like umpteen instruments, well. So I learned how to pla y t he violin badly, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

because I really want ed to pla y the piano, but my brother got the piano, per usual, he 
got everythi ng, you know -- know the ol
d 
ch 
--
 m y brother was a 
--
 is and was a very 
gentle, sweet boy. I was really the monster. I mean, h-he 
--
 it wa --  it  -- definitel y 
role reversal there somewhere, you know. But  yeah, we got along fairly well. 

Q: What ki nd of school did you go to? 
A: Well,
 in the beginni ng we went  to a public school -- I mean, publi c -- sort of 
private publ ic school, li ke they have in 
Europe
. It wasn't a school like the y have 

here, it was a small school. But t hen event uall y, when thi ngs were very bad, we had 

a tutor that came from another town and taught all the Jewish chil dren in -- in -- in -- 

in -- in 
Speyer. 
He came every 
-- 
ev ery d a y.
 
Q: When youwere very young 
--  
A: Yeah?  
Q: -- did you feel very German? 
A: I never t hought about it, I was German, that was it. I was a German and a Jew 

and the two were not mutually excl usive, you know, there was one or the o -- I wou 

-- if you™re sa ying did I feel a great sense of patriotism about 
Germany
? I don™t 

know. I don™t think any child really thinks of it, unless -- I mean, t oday, after 

September t he 11
th
, I™m sure there are children who will  sa y, I™m an American and -- 
and be very conscious, who were unconsci ous before. I think it takes a catastrophi c 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

event to make a child realize it. I became very conscious of being a Jew, and no
t 
being accepted as a German, after awhile. 

Q: 
Yeah, yeah. 
Did you have any non-
Jewish friends 
-- 
A: Yes.  

Q: -- er -- early on? 
A: Oh y
es
, I had al wa ys Christian friends. As a matter of fact, I got a letter not too 
long ago from one of them, and I should - - I se -- I™ll send you -- and she goes to my 
sister™s grave and she makes sure that it™s stil l taken care of. So I mean, she -- yeah, 
I did, and I loved t hem. And the y still played with me. I mean, some of -- some 
--
 I 
mean, my mother, for example, sent me to a convent to learn how to knit and 

embroider because she and her -- m y grandmother threw up their hands, the y 

couldn™t do it. And they sent me to the nuns, and I learned how to kni t and I learned 
how to embroider. I had a nun there who woul d sit there 
andtell me wonderful 
stories. And it was fine. I was a Jewish child. I was the chi ld of a -- 
a 
-- Dr. 
Greenberg
 and nobody ever thought about it. I also had a laundress who came -- we 
had a laundress who brought laundry back -- back and forth every week. I went to 

her house, I had ham sandwiches, and I -- m y father found out, he was a little 

excited, but  I was never very good. So, I mean I -- those are the kind of things you 

said how I got in t roubl e. I knew I shouldn™t during Passover eat bread, let alon
e 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

cold cuts. So I mean, that™s the kind of troubles I was alwa ys in. But it was, as I said, 
fine. I mean, I loved it. I would go with m y -- I would go to the nuns and the y would 

teach me. So there was a lot of interaction bet ween a non-Jewish community and our 

family.
 
Q: And favorite hol idays that you remember? Anything t hat stays out in your mi nd?  
A: Yes, yes, I remembered -- I alwa ys liked the holida ys, I did not like Passover
, 
ever. I hated the 
Seder
, I thought i t was endless. I wanted to eat. But I liked Rosh 
Hashanah, I loved Yom Kippur, because I was allowed to eat lunch, and then I l oved 

breaking fast, because they used to make something called  
Pergelfleisch.
 I don™t 

know if you know what that is. It™s -- it sounds horrific, it™s called pickled beef, but 

it is the most wonderful thing in the worl d, nobody™s ever makes i t, nobody knows 

how to make it in t his country. And I look
ed
 forward to t hat and having bread and I 
like the -- I like Sat urday night dinners, except Swiss cheese. My father once sai d to 

me why 
-- why do you -- 
Marg
it
, why do you hate Swiss? He s --  I said, I only l ike 
the holes. Now those are the kind of things that did not endear me to m y mother. 
Q: What language did you speak at home? 

A: German. A little French, but mostly German. 

Q: And why French? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
12
 
A: Because m y mother liked it. But I mean, we™re talking about phrases like 
n™est
-
ce 
pas, 
or yo
u know, 
comme il faut,
 or something like that. We™re not speaking -- 
I me 
-- I mean, I™m not talking about real, real conversational French. 
Q: We
ll now let™s begi n -- when did you first hear of a man named 
H itler
? I mean, 

you were born in 1929, so when did you first hear -- 
A: I think when I was five -- five, six years ol d. It™s when -- when I first saw the 
uniforms and I saw marching through the streets, and then -- 

Q: What 
-- what do these uniforms mean t o a five year old?  
A: Th-The reaction of the adults to them. I -- I think I became more nervous about 

them because of the reaction of the adults. The fact that suddenly t here was a 

difference, there was more tension. 

Q: Did your parents explain what this meant? Earl -- we™re talking about early on. 
Did your parents say anything? 
A: No, no the y didn™t. All I know is that, for an example I was wal king down t he 

street one da y when I was about ma ybe s
even
. I think i t was -- began really when I 
was seven, and the y were throwing stones at my brother and I, and they were yelli ng 

dirty Jew and -- and he -- he was hurt, I mean, the y hit him. And when he -- we 

camehome, that™s when myfather and m y mothers
aid we couldn™t play any more 

and we coul dn™t go to the school any more. So I was about seven or eight when it 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
13
 
really, really, really began. And the German soldiers themselves began to change. 
Their attitude became 
--
 there was so much hostility now. There was a different, 
there was a 
--
 a break, and there was fear. 
Kri stallnacht
 was when I was nine years 
old already. It had begun wa y before then. Not as terrible as it was after 

Kristallnacht
, but there was a change. There was no longer the comfort level. 
Q: What happened i n school? Was this -- was your school a Jewish school, or both 
Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?  

A: The y were -- it was a non-Jewi sh school, and they were non-Jewi sh teachers, and 

they did begin to express a difference. I-I think there was begin -- the beginning wa -

- who -- whichever one of them was a -- 
an anti
-
Semit
ism, now felt free to express 
it, whereas before they might not have. 

Q: This is preceding 
Kristallnacht
, we™re talking about? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, I -- i t was, but again, it was much worse after
 Kristallnacht. 
After
 Kristallnacht
 it became flagrant. And t hen -- let me sa y that at  the time, you a 

-- also -- after -- 
even after
 Kristallnacht
, there were still people who did not, in any 

way, react to us in a negative wa y, who became overtly ant i-Semit ic. The people 

who were really anti-Semi tic were always ant i-Semitic. Now the children were the 

surprise. The children who became so -- 
who became, youknow, really taunted us 

and began --  made life so difficult for us. Those are the ones -- 
the mu 
-- most of the 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
14
 
u -- most of the Christi ans ignored it, ignored us. The y might not have been friendly, 
but they were not overtl y 
--
 they were not overtl y cruel or anything. It was the 
children more than anything else, and some of the t
eachers.
 
Q: When you and your brother were walking down the street, you said in some 

[indecipherable]
 can you describe that in more detail what your -- what thoughts 
were going through your head as a young child, when that was happening?  

A: When I was wal king -- I walked with m y brother and they began t aunting us 

both.  

Q: What ki nd of things were said, do you remember? 

A: You dirty Jew, 
Christ
 killer. That was a big one. All -- get out ,we don™t want 
you, you don™t belong here, all the usual. And then they picked up st ones and it 

became physical. The y hit me, and I ran. I t hink the y ma y -- I may have fallen and 
scraped my knee. They hit m y brother and of course, you know, he bled. And after 
that we were not all owed to go to school any more, my mother said no, we were not 

going to go. And we never went anywhere -- anywhere wi thout having somebody 

along, or traveling i n -- more than t wo. It was a terrible thing. I thi nk it traumatized 

m y brother to the point  that even t oda y he doesn™t even tal k about  it, l et alone 

remember it. It was a terrible -- 

Q: When 
-- when di d t his happen? Was it before 
Kristall nacht
? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
15
 
A: Yeah, it happened before 
Kristallnacht.
 
Maybe 
-- I™m t rying t o think, was it 
before? No, I think it happened after. There were things that were happening before, 

but after
 Kristallnacht 
it all came together. It became a -- it became now a 

government  directed persecution and I think it became -- and -- and 
--
 and now the 
rhetoric was geared up so high. I mean, you know, we -- 
we 
-- the -- t he -- the -- the 
-- the vendet ta against Jew -- Jews, and the fine -- resolution became now a par -- 
a 
-
- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- an ai m, a political aim. And it became -- and I think -- you give people 

enough propaganda and you tell them and you repeat something enough, even t he y 

wa -- the y want to believe it. If the y have any dis -- I mean, today in t his country, if 

you have a minority that somebody disli kes, if you give them enough power and 

justification to react  to that minority, the y will  do it. And
 Hitler
 gave people the 
right to do it. He gave t hose children the ri ght to hurt us. And he gave those people 
the right to burn down the synagogues and to arrest people and to murder them, and 
let the oth 
--
 and let -- and let them -- and let t he -- the people stand by passively and 
allow it to happen, because he made them feel that this was oka y, that  they -- 
he was 

absolutely getting rid of an -- of a world evil. That he was destroying a hydra-headed 

monster cal led a Jew. So it -- that was permissible. 

Q: What does a flag with a swastika or a German in a uniform mean to a seven year 

old little gi rl?  

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
16
 
A: Oh, a -- it frightened me. I remember I used to walk very quickly with m y head 
down if I saw them. They would stand, you know, at kiosks and if I saw one of 

them, and the sad t hing, the sad thi ng that I di d not forgive myself for for a long, 

long ti me was that I was so intimidated by them and wanted so much to belong and 

be part of that -- this -- this -- this life, these children that had -- 
were sorejecting to 
me 
-- you know, were rejecting me. And I saw them with their lit tle uniforms and I 
wanted so much that I actually one da y wal ked by a German soldier and the chil d 
ahead of me had given the 
heil Hi tler
 sign, and I raised m y hand and said 
heil 

Hitler
. Even though I know this m -- I knew by then that this man was our sworn 

enemy. I mean, the y had arrested my father already, and -- by then. And I knew. 

And I remember he turned around and he said to me, you™re a Jew, which humiliated 

me even more. Now, it took me years, I couldn™t think about it. When I would think 
about it I would li ke break out in sweat, I was so humiliated and embarrassed and 
angry that I -- but I was -- I forgave myself after awhile. I realized I was a child, I 

wanted to belong, I wanted to be part, and I wasn™t any more. I was now ostracized. 

All -- we all were. All our friends were. We were now 
persona non grata
. 

Q: And again, did you t alk this over with your parents? 

A: Oh yes, we talked -- 

Q: And how did t he y handle it?  

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
17
 
A: The y themselves didn™t know how -- what to do. My father only knew one thing, 
that we had to leave, that it was done, that we had to go. That -- but he couldn™t, he 

could not get out. The y -- he was refused the visas, he was considered a political 

prisoner and he coul dn -- but he knew. I mean, he ur
ged my cousi ns, heurged m y 

uncles, he urged everybody to go, the y al l left. The y all went. They went. He knew 
that there was no survi val. 
Q: Whe
-When did he try t o start leaving? 
A: He left -- immediatel y after he came back from 
Dachau
, when they had arrested 

hi m aft -- at 
Kristal lnacht 
the y arrested hi m. He came back six weeks later, he di d 

everything i n his power -- I think he had done it before, but not with the kind of 

urgency that he felt then. 

Q: 
Prec
-
Preceding November™38, washis work 
at the nu 
--
 at the synagogue 
affected at all? 

A: No, that continued. And I™ll tel l you somet hing else that was i nteresting. One of 

the priests tried to 
--
 
wa 
-- on -- during 
Kri stallnacht 
woke him up to tell hi m the 
synagogue was burning, the y ran down and saved the Torah. I mean, you know ya -- 

I mean, the 
--
 i-in all  -- in the midst of absolute evil -- and I use that word in its true 
sense, there are peopl e who took an interest. I remember walking with my mother 

while m y father was in the -- in 
Dachau
 and I met  one of my nuns. I had -- 
was no

longer going there, you know, because I thi nk it was difficult for them, the y couldn™t 
-- I mean, anybody who had anything to do with a Jew was at risk. So I remember 

she bent down, she kissed me, and I had thi s overwhel ming feeling of sadness, 

because sh- she ha -- the tear rolled down her cheek. So I mean she -- they all -- we 

all knew, I mean everybody knew that we were condemned. Nobody knew about  the 
concentration camps yet. My father knew 
Dachau
 existed and 
Buchenwald
 existed, 
but nobody understood what the ul ti mate plan was. I mean, nobody could -- would 
have believed it, except  that m y father knew that the ulti mate plan was to kill 

everybody, and he wanted his family out. Now, I think m y mot her -- and this is 

something I™m 
not  sure about, but I do bel ieve from what I remember as a child, t hat 
m y mother could have left, and she refused. She sta yed with m y father. So I -- 
you 
know, I think she could have gone with her brothers, because the y were leaving, and 
m y grandmother could have gone too, and they chose not to go, they chose to sta y. 
Q: Could she have tak
en  you
 too, the two of you? 
A: Probably. But for some reason she wanted 
--
 she didn™t do it. She didn™t. She 
condemned herself, effectively, to death, and probably us too, al though I don™t t hink 

she really believed t hey would ki ll us. I don™t think any mother believes that her 

children are going to be killed. But I think she could have gone. And that -- for 

knowing m y mot her as I know her, it -- as I remember her, it -- it 
--
 she was such a

delicate, as I said, nervous woman, for her to have made that decision had to take 
enormous courage. I mean, for her to know that she was going to stay i n this horrible 

place where, you know, when everybody el se was starting to go, you know, I think it 

had to take enormous strength. I don™t know if I could have done it. I don™t know if I 

wouldn™t have said, I -- I™m sorry, I -- I™m t aki ng m y children, I™m running. I think it 
takes a very strange love, belief, confidence in your mate, or not being willing to 
leave hi m, you know, to -- to face it by hi mself. I -- I -- he -- she di d that. I think that 

-- that -- that ™s one of the remarkable things about her.

interview with 
Margitta Cooper
. This is tape number one, side
 B.
 Let™s now talk 
about 
Kristallnacht. 
What are your memori es of that specific ti me? 
A: I think i t was probabl y one of the major traumas in my life. First of all there was 
the burning of the synagogue, whi ch while I -- I must say, being a little brat, as I 

said, or a child, for one glorious moment I sai d, oh thank God, I don™t have to go. 

But then I 
--
 then even -- e-even I understood that this was not a good thing. But 
then the y came to arrest my father.

Q: Wer
-
Were you
 
awake at 
night? Whe
- When did you first become aware what was 
happening?  
A: I heard t he bangi ng on the doors, and I heard them -- m y father goi ng downstairs 

and we -- 
the maidand my mother an
d I heard -- I knew it was the pri est. And m y 

father ran out of the house. 
Q: This is in the middle of the night? 
A: Yes. And then when he came back at five o™clock that morning, I heard again, a 

lot of noise, and I ran downstairs and I -- I mean, I don™t think the y had gone to 

sleep, I mean, nobody did. I mean, my father was still dressed, and he had burned 

his hand, and I think he had -- was wearing like a bandage on it. And the 
SS
 had 

come in and the y were arresting him. And m y mother -- this is -- 
and m y mother was 
hysterical, everybody was hysteri cal and I started to become hyst erical because I 
didn™t understand. I must sa y the 
SS 
again, this is the contradiction in human beings, 
when the y saw me and m y brother, the y tried to reassure me. The y sai d, it™ll be all 
right, your father will be all right. And of course the y were very polit e. I mean, there 

was nothing of the 
sturm 
and 
drung
 kind of thing that you see in the movies. The y 
were very cal m, very icy, very -- you know, waited for hi m to 
get hi
 
--
 
you
 know, 
put his coat on and everyt hing, 
and he was ar
rested. Now, once that happened 
m y 
mother did everythi ng t o get hi m out, once we found out where he was, how -- t he 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

police kind of told her where he was, or somebody told her. My grandmother and 
m y uncle 
all tried everyt hing. And I™ll tell you a story that sounds li ke somethi ng out 
of a movie. My mother took -- tol d me to get dressed one afternoon, and I -- were t -

- I-I was dressed, and she took me by the hand, and she had her pocketbook, and in 

her -- 
an
d er -- and she was holding a little chamois bag. And I™ll never forget the -- 
and I remembered what she wore. She wore a -- she had a magnificent blue coat 
with a blue fox coll ar and she wore that coat with a matching bl ue dress. And we 

went to the police, and we sat outside and wait ed, and I had no idea and for once I 

was very quiet. And then she -- the y told her to come in and we sat in front of this 

man
 and he wore a black uniform with the 
SS
 -- I mean, t he swast ika on his arm. 
And m y mother said to -- they were talking and then she opened this little bag and 

she too -- put all her jewelry on the desk and she said, you may have i t all. She said, 
I would like you t o have it, she says, if you can get me -- if m y husband come home. 
And I™ll never forget what this man said, he looked at -- m y mother was a very 

pretty woman, and he t oo-took her -- the jewel ry and he put it back in the bag and he 

handed it to her -- of course it was all gone eventually anywa y. And he sa ys, I 

cannot take it, he says, but I will -- and I ca -- he sa ys, I will try to do what I can. So 

we went home, and about three days later I heard footsteps comi ng down the street 

toward our house, I knew it was m y father. I knew it. I woke up the whole

household. I start screaming, I said, Papa™s 
h ome,
 
Papi™s home. And everybody sa ys 
no, no, no. My mother says, what? I said, he™s coming. And sure enough, the door 
rang -- there was a knock on the door, we all flew, and there was m y father. He had 

taken -- he --  as he left the camp, he had gi ven his jacket, his overcoat , everything he 

had to the prisoners that were left, that would never come home. And he had a white 
-- he wore his white shirt, he was very thin. My -- 
m y 
-- m y mot her, of course, wept. 
We put hi m into -- he went to bed and I remember during the morning -- 
this was 
very early in the morning, was maybe 5:30 - six o™clock in the morning -- everyt hing 

in 
Germany
 happens either in the middle of the night or early in the morning. That 
seemed to be their best time, you know, li ke the vampires, you know, do well at 

night. Anyway, I remember tiptoeing into his room to make sure that he was there, 

you kn
ow? And I remember he looked at me, he says, 
Margit
? And I said yes. I 
said, are you all right? He sa ys yes. Of course he wasn™t, because he knew. You see, 

m y father then knew that ultimately it was all downhill from then. I mean, you 

know, the school, everything had stopped, the tutors came. The y were -- the families 

were trying to get out. Of course, the famil ies that ended up going to
 Gerthe 
wit h 

us, stayed. The y di d not get out. And I sti ll -- of course, and there were still a lot of 

people who really believed that thi s was some kind of night mare, that something 

was going to happen. But then the united -- 
I mean, 
England
 went to war.

Q: How lo -- how long was your father in 
Dachau
?  
A: Six weeks. The y kept hi m from 
Kristallnacht 
out and he came home in the 
beginning of January. 

Q: Did he tell you anyt hing about what happened while he was there? 

A: He said it was very bad. He says there were a lot of people there. He said there 
were a lot of young men there. And he also sai d that that ti me that  they were not 
getting out , that these were people that -- I don™t think the y had gas chambers then, 

but these were really prisoners -- not all Jews. I don™t think the y were all Jews. But 

he said the conditions were horrific. There was hunger. Of course he was so thin 

when he came home. There was already hunger, there was already a l ack of food, 

there was lack of warmth, it was very, very cold. That™s why he left al l his clothi ng, 

as much as he could. The conditions were very bad and obviously he knew, he 
sensed that the y were gearing up for somet hing very big. And he also found out that 
Dachau
 was just one camp. There was also
 
Buchenwa ld 
then. And he was -- 
Belsen-Bel sen
 wasn™t there yet. But he was -- he knew. He had heard from what 
--
 
he -- he told my uncle, who had come to visit him right before he left -- he left for -- 

for -- for the 
United States
. That™s why I know that m y mother could have probably 

gone b
ecause m y uncle came from 
Berlin
 t o see his sister. And

Q: But what did you do when your father was away? What activity, did -- 
were you 
still in school or had -- had you been expell ed from school? 

A: My mother slept with us that ni ght. I didn™t -- oh, I forgot to tel l you that. The 

night that m y father was arrested, t hat da y my mother was so pani cked that she 

packed us up and took us to cousins in 
Ma nnhei m.
 She thought that -- she -- she -- 
she just was so frightened and probably went t here to figure out what they could do 

for -- for my father. We stayed there, I™d say almost a week. And I remember I cried 

that night, I got like hysterical, I don™t know why. I don™t know if it was a 

performance, that I was being 
Sa ra h Bernha rdt,
 or what , but I --  I -- I -- you know, 
and we stayed for a week and then came home and I think that™s when she -- dis -- di 

-- I think that™s when already they had begun t o try to get to release him. The tut or 

came, I still  played with my friends, my l ittle Jewish friends. I di dn™t -- I don™t t hink 
any Christi an child was allowed to pla y wi th a Jew any more at all. 
Q: When had you start ed with a tutor? 

A: As soon as we had t o leave school, all t he children, all the Jewish children got  

tutors to co -- got one t utor and we were taught in a little room someplace. 

Q: When 
-- when di d you have to leave school , do you remember? 
A: Yes, after 
Kristallnacht.
 
Oh, ma ybe 
-- I think after
 Kristallnacht
, yeah, yeah, 
yeah. I think it was then, and I think it was very uncomfortable before then, too. You 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

know, there was a l ot of anti-Semi tism. And as I said, the teachers who really di dn™t 
like Jews were free to begin to react to it. 

Q: W
- Were you physically hurt in school at al l? 
A: No. No, no. No, no. 

Q: What 
-- what kind of things did the teachers say to you? 
A: Well, she woul d -- you know, she -- it 
--
 it wasn™t anything overt. It was, your 
people, or --  you know, th-the -- the usual things, you know. Y-You know, you all 

think you know everything, or something, you know, there -- wa -- t here were litt le 

slurs, which they could get awa y with. I think after 
Kristallnacht
 they could have 
probably been much more overt. But by t hen aw -- there was no child that was 

going. I mean, we couldn't walk the st reets, we were afraid. Our parents were afraid. 

So  i
t had become an absolutely i mpossibility for a child to continue i n public school. 
And it -- it -- it was dangerous. So m y brother and I and m y friend 
Truda  Alcon,
 
who now lives in 
New York 
and 
Gunter Katzen
, all of us had this crazy man who 
came, poor soul, he came from 
Ludwigshaven 
every morning and went back. He 
was a bad teacher, too, very boring.  

Q: Wa
-Was there secul ar subjects and religious, or just -- 

A: Secular. My father taught religion, you know, whatever religion I have -- 
had. I 

wa -- I became, of course, an agnostic by t he time I could think st raight.

Q: Do you remember names having to be added on, 
Sa rah
 and 
Israel
 to the par -- 
adult names? Does that  -- 
A: No, no, I don™t remember that at all, no. No, the y -- you mean i  -- i -- to identify 
us? 

Q: Yeah.  
A: No, I don™t remember that. I don™t think so, no. The only thing was that -- things 
settled actually into a routine. That is why the arrest in 1940, to go to 
Gurs
 
was such 
a profound shock, because life had become a routine, like everythi ng else. I didn't 

think -- nobody thought about being re-arrested again. I mean, my fat her, I think 

suspected and maybe m y mother, but I as a child thought everyt hing was over. So 

when the y came that  night, I had no idea. 

Q: Preceding 
Kristallnacht, Hitler
 had marched into
 Austria
 -- 
A: Mm-hm. Yeah 
--
 oh, w
e 
-- 
Q: -- did you, as a chil d, know about that? 

A: Oh, we all knew. My fa -- there was a -- m y parents were very pol itical and their 

friends were political, so I knew about the 
a nschluss
 and I knew about --  
Q: And again, what  does that mean to you as a child, a ni ne year old? 

A: I wanted 
Hitler
 to die. I wanted 
Hitler
 --  
I wantedthe Jews 
-- I had these 
fantasies about these great Jewish generals riding, in their great armies, to defeat

Hitler
. I had visions o
f 
-- of God coming 
--
 and I believed in God, of course -- I bel 
-- I thought  that God would reach down hi s hand, the way he did it in the Bible and -
- and -- and smite t hem, all the Germans, al l the Nazis. That was my fantasy, and 

that™s what I -- well, I was alwa ys a dreamer and I visualized thi s, you know, these -- 

this great host suddenl y coming and -- 
and
 -- and destroyi ng the Germans. And that 
was wonderful and that ™s why I knew that there was war. And when 
England
 would 
send her planes over at night, and m y father and I would be outsi de watching the 
planes comi ng, while m y par -- m y mother and my brot her and m y grandmother 

were downstairs, m y broth 
-- m y father and I would go up to see. And the planes 
were coming, they were bombing 
Germany
 
as early as 
1939, most people don™t 
realize it, 1939 and ™40. I was thril led. I loved it, I was excited that  the Englanders 

were coming. The English were coming. Yes, I wanted 
Germany
 to be defeated. I 
knew that, you know, that I -- 
the Russians 
had -- I mean, I was horri fied when I 
heard that the Russians were friends with the Germans because of the pact that 

Stalin
 had made. I mean, those were things that stunned me. 

Q: Had you -- what  did you know about the 
United States
 by that ti me, by ™38 - ™39 

- ™40?  What did th
e 
United States
 mean to you? What di 
--
 what was the 
concept of 
the 
United States 
to a child? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

A: The 
United States
 of course was not called the 
United States
, it was called 
America
. 
America
 was the land, l iterally, of mil k and hone y. 
America
 was the 
Promised Land. 
Ameri ca
 was the l and that  God chose for us to go to, if we were 

lucky. It was the pl ace of miracles. It was utopia. It was everything that human 

beings coul d possibly visualize. The great hope was 
America
, and that I underst ood. 
What it was, I didn™t know. I knew it was a country, but  I had no idea -- it was 

something myth 
--  almost m ystic. It -- I didn™t know, I just knew that I had to get to 
America
, that in order to live, for us to be safe, we had to go to 
America
. And that™s 

all I knew and that™s -- I heard that, of course, from adults.  

Q: Did you ever listen to speeches of 
Hitler
 on the radio? 

A: No, wel l yeah, t he raving and the ranting, but I didn™t  full y understand, you 

know. But  when you talk about 
America
, I had read 
Lord Fauntleroy, 
who was 
born in
 Brooklyn
, you see, so I had an idea of how wonderful 
Ameri ca
 was, and I 
had read some books that -- that you know, I -- I had read a translation of some -- 

some books that had Americans in them. So I knew that 
t hiswas the place, 

absolutely.  

Q: So life continu -- your father came back from 
Dachau
, you had private tutoring, 
and life -- 

A: Mm-hm, he conduct ed services. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

Q: Yes.  
A: He conti nued conducting services. Everyt hing was going all ri ght. 

Q: What 
-- what happened to the rabbi of the synagogu
e? 
 
A: Well, he was not there that much. My father usually conducted th-the -- the 

services there. He a -- 
Q: What was the rabbi™s name? 
A: I don™t even remem ber. I don™t remember, isn™t that sad? 

Q: How much -- 

A: 
Lehrer
 
--
 
was it
 
Lehrer
? 
Yeah.  
Q: Ho-Ho w much destruction was there of your synagogue? 

A: Not that -- not t hat much, we -- it was able to be used. The only thing that was 

damaged, I t hink, was t he -- in -- in the -- t he sanctuary and I think that was 
repaired. I -- as I said, the life, oddly enough, continued after 
Kristall nacht
, in a -- 
in a bizarre sort of a way. There was -- I -- I 
--
 there was -- there was none of the -- I 
mean, we didn™t live in fear and trembling, at l east I didn™t. What m y parents or my 

father felt, I don™t know. I™m sure t
h ey 
-- t he y were much -- but I didn™t, I -- 
yo u 
know, children are very resilient. I accepted things had changed. I™m not going to 

public school, I have a tutor. I don™t go outside to pla y that much, that™s fine. I mean, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

I adapted and it becam e normal. What was -- what was abnormal now became 
normal. 

Q: Did you confide in your brother at all? 

A: No. Mm-mm, we were -- very rarely talked about this. And t hen, you know, 

eventually i t wasn™t  normal any more. 1940 arrived and the Nazis arri ved and they 
arrested us again in the middle of the night, the Germans are night people. And t he y 
came and sai d pack up, and that was it, I mean, that was the end. And we left our 

house for good. 

Q: Ta-Talk a little bit about that experience, when you -- were -- 
you were
 fast 
asleep?  

A: I was fast asleep, again there was a banging on the door and the sol diers came i n. 

Not Nazis, soldiers. They t old us we had two and a half hours to pack everything we 
need
. My mother forgot my clothes, most  of them, so that was very tough for me in 
Gurs
. I mean, you know, kind of had to wear a very few things. She na -- she was 
very upset t hat she forgot. But anywa y -- but I would have outgrown t hem anywa y. 
Anywa y, she -- we had two and a half hours. My father wept. That™s the only ti me I 

can ever
 remember m y father, because my father knew that  this was it . Of course, 
his horror was that we were going to go to 
Buchen 
-- 
he did not know about
 
G urs 
in 

France
. He thought we were going either to 
Dachau
 or 
Buchenwa ld. 
So we packed

that night, the y came in trucks and took us. There were lots of people on the trucks. 
And --  

Q: Wa
-
Was thisthefourof you, or more of yourextendedfamily?
 
A: It was my -- the four of us and my grandmother, who died in
 Gurs.
 
My mot her™s 

mother. The five of us went into t he trucks where there were already other people 
and the y took us t o a train station and then to 
Frankfurt.  
Q: How old were your parents? Were the y i n t heir what, late 30™s, earl y 40™s?  
A: 40™s, in their 40™s, cause my sister had been 10, so m y mother was in her early 

30™s, she must have been then in her very earl y 40™s, yeah. And so was m y father, 

though my father must have been ol der, in his -- 
ma ybein his mi ddle 40™s.Anywa y, 
we went to 
Fra nkfurt.
 
Q: Tell me about getting on the truck. What were people sa yi ng? 
A: Silent. There was dead silence. It  was very quiet. I mean, we just sat there and I 
think some people wanted to know where we were going, and what was happening. 

And the thi ng that my mother was very upset about, cause there was laundry in t he 

laundry, in the -- in the washing machine. I mean, those are the litt le things that  are 

absolutely heartb
reaking when you think that a woman was riding to eventual death. 

And what was she worried about? That somebody would find out she had laundry 

left in the washing machine. That™s what enrages me so. That™s when I feel total 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

rage, at that 
--
 
those litt le minutia
e, you know, those little -- little t hings. Anywa y, it 
was quiet.  
Q: Did you take anyt hing special as a child? A toy or a book or anyt hing that meant 

som
ething to you?
 
A: I took m y books. That™s unfortunate because I didn™t have any clot hes, but I t ook 
books. I took 
Tarzan
, I took the 
kinderha 
-- hagen
, th-the -- that -- that -- that the -
- that™s a special seri es of little books 
that will 
-- for a -- she -- it was called 
kinderhag en.  
And that means the l ittle nestling, you know, the little bird? That™s 

what it is, like a child, you know. And I took some books. 
We 
-- it was chilly. We 
got to 
Frankfurt
, the y gave us wonderful sandwiches, and which were -- which 
were not kosher but  my father said I could eat t hem. I thought the y were great. I sai d 

oh, this is going t o be wonderful. Then we got on the trai n. Huge trai n that stretched 
for as far as you could see. And we all got on there, everybody that was -- had been 
unloaded from the t rucks got on this trai n. 

Q: So the t ruck went di rectly to the train station. 

A: Right, station, right. The train curved around the entire track, that™s how long it 

was, and we all got on there, and that m -- at that moment, m y grandmother, I think 

had what is known to 
--
 would have been call ed a 
TIA, 
a 
transient i schemic 
attack
.
 
She did not know where she was and she was disoriented and confused and of 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

course terrified. And -- but she was oka y after that. We got on the trai n and the train 
began -- and -- and t hey were slamming t he doors shut and -- 

Q: This is a passenger t rain, with seats? 

A: This was not a cattle train. And the y were slamming, and the train began to move 

and then it stopped, about an hour later and said, anyone who has jewelry, give it  up 
now, a -- or you wi ll be severely punished. Now, there are people who -- 
m y mother 
didn™t have any, and if sh -- I mean, she had gi ven her -- ma -- jewel ry that belonged 
to her to m y uncle to take to the 
United States
 and I got t hat event ual ly, but just a 
few pieces. Most of it she had already sold. I t hink probably to bribe -- bribe -- for 

bribery to get my father out, which was fine. Whatever mone y the y 
--
 she had. And 
there were people who did hand it over and there are other pe-people I don™t think 

ever did, and I hope they didn™t. It didn™t matter, the y were going t o di e anywa y. So 
anyway, the train then went, continued and continued and -- for hours. I mean, don™t 
forget, we were leaving 
Fra nkfurt
 and going t o the 
Pyrenees, 
whi
ch is 
-- 
and you 
know, so i t was overnight. And then we got to this place, and there were more 

trucks. And the y unloaded the train, this enormous train of people -- 

Q: Were there many childrenwith you?
 
A: Oh yes. Well, t he famil ies, yeah, the y had a lot of children, which is an 

interesting story. When we got to 
Gurs, 
I am not -- I™m very vague how we got

there. I think it was also by bus, but we got to this place which was a sea of mud 
with barracks. The y separated the men and the women. The women had the chil dren. 

Q: O-On t he -- on the trip to 
Gurs -- 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- you said there were many chil dren. Were the children cal m? What did -- did 
the parents say to t hem? What did your parent s say to you o-on t he journey to 
G urs
?  
A: My -- I -- I asked wh
er
-where we were goi ng, and I go -- I have to tell you, m y 
parents were very -- always very truthful. My father said he did not know and so did 

m y mother. But m y father also sai d we are t ogether. And 
--
 and that was -- I thi nk 
reassuring. I was not afraid. Now, I t
hink ma ybe 
-- I™m not sure, i n retrospect, 
whether the reason I wasn™t afraid is because even though I alwa ys t hought through 

these last four -- three or four years that it had no affect, it did affect me and that  I 
had become very 
-- not stoic, ma ybe but dis -- disaffected, or disas -- you know, and 
no longer associati ve with a -- you know, a -- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- lacking affect, in other words. 

That ma ybe in some way I had detached m yself, so that I was really looking at i t 

now from 
--
 from -- from a perspect ive that had nothing t o do with me. I was there. 
So ma ybe that™s really more the truth than anything else. At any rate, I was not 

afraid. I didn™t know, and I wasn™t afraid of death, and I certainly never thought of 

anybody harming me. When we got to 
Gurs
 and I saw the sea of mud, I knew. The

women, once they were separated from thei r men, fell apart. And thi s little dictator, 
meaning me, and all  the other children -- oh, the German soldiers then said, get t he 

women organized. To us. To us children. So that we were marching up and down 

these long barracks where these women were huddled, di dn™t know what -- I sai d, 

get yoursel ves organized. I said to m y mother, sit there wi th 
Omar
.And my mother, 
who would have probabl y had a shrieking fit having been told by her 10 year old 

daughter how to behave, right, did exactly what we told -- and we were so drunk 

with power, these kids, we were like, you know ﬁ
Lord of the Fli es
ﬂ?
 I mean, we 
were telling everybody what to do. There was no place to lie down, there was no 

place to do anything, I mean, it was barracks. Long barracks with nothing. 

Eventually they gave us these pallets, you know, to lie -- sit on, to lie on, but there 

was nothing then. And then the y did come with the pallet s and the y handed them 
out. And every family, every mother and her child had li ke a little -- 
ha
-
have you 
been to -- in barracks? You know, you can put  stuff under the little eaves, you 
know? Well, that™s where the y put their possessions and that™s where we were, it 

was very cold, damp, and very m
ud dy.
 
Q: You™re talking Apri l 1940. 

A: Yeah, yeah. And a sea of mud. I mean, t hat ™s the one t hing I remember about -- 

no, this was in Oct ober of 19 -- was it -- 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

36
 
Q: Oh, I™m sorry, October 1940.  
A: Yeah. This was a sea of mud. I mean, you could not step anywhere. And the 
--
 
and the -- and of course the mu -- 
t h e m 
-- wives were terrified, the mothers were 
terrified because the y no longer were with thei r husbands. And t he y went out on 

their own wi -- among these strangers with these soldiers. And -- 
Q: Did yo u sa y goodbye to your father when you were separated? 
A: Yeah, we said goodbye, and I knew he was going to be down the road from us. 
The y did tell us that they, you know, the men were going to be in one section and 

the women were goi ng to be in another sect ion. But it -- but can you imagine leaving 

your home and suddenl y being transported for 24 hours or whatever ti me it took, 

and i -- and then put into a strange place in a barracks? I mean, and having 

absolutely nobody to tell you anyt hing, nobody t o explai n to you what was 
happening t o you? I mean, 
f 
-- Americans -- I mean, I -- 
I sometimes thinkto 
m yself, what would happen if tomorrow morning this happened i n thi s country, 

people suddenly vanished? I mean, you no longer saw anybody that had lived in that 

house for umpteen years and was suddenly gone. So I mean, th -- it was a terrifyi ng 

time for -- for -- for -- for these -- for these poor women and for the 
--
 and the 
children were crying, a lot of the children were crying, the y were afraid. Again, I 

wasn™t afraid. I -- I j ust 
a 
-- I -- you know, I just gave orders. And it worked. I -- in a 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

strange wa y I guess the -- the -- the three or four of us who were running around 
being, you know, t he administrat ors probably did a lot of good because it made 

some of the mother™s angry enough to say, who are you to tell us anyt hing, and it 

probably established a sense of normalc y, you know? And that was the beginning of 
Gurs. 
Q: And then what did you -- what 
--
 what --  di d the y give you any food? Can you 
describe the living conditions there? 
A: The food was horrific. The y had a stove that really didn™t throw much heat. The 

food was really like very -- like thi n gruel soups. The y had a place t hat the y had 

built o -- on -- 
like on 
--
 on -- that you wal ked up, it was l ike on stilts, where the y 
had running water and stuff and a toilet, and toilets. And where you could wash. The 

camp had originally been established for Spanish prisoners and had been emptied 
after the Spanish Civil War. So act ually we were using that, those facilities and of 
course they were not great facilities. It was a -- I think there was a lot of ent -- 

diarrhea, I mean, all the unpleasant  side effects of not having a -- a decent food and 

decent water and decent conditions and certainl y very -- 
no medical
 care, very little 

medical care. There were deaths. A little child died while out there. My father was 

allowed to sort of wander around and sort of, you know, help, because he was, 
you 
know, a-
as a 
-- sort of a religious leader, the y allowed hi m certain pri vileges.

Q: Could he come over to your section? 
A: He came to visit , oh yeah. And I went -- was able to see hi m. I wasn™t allowed to, 

but I™d sneak over t here anywa y. Yeah, he 
--
 t he men were allowed to visit. I mean, 
not conjugal visits, just to see their families. Yeah, I think maybe once a week or so, 

they came. My father came more frequently. He also was able to get me -- he was 
able to get my mot her galoshes. The thing that was alwa ys -- you know, like lit tle 
boots, because of -- and me, too. The thing I did learn, and I™ve never forgotten is if 

you need to flee anywhere, you bett er damn sight have mone y. You can™t stop at the 

ATM
 machine. You have to have cash on you, your life is always saved by money. 

Mone y is a most valuable commodity you can have, if you are stuck anywhere 

where -- you can alwa ys buy your wa y out. It™s sad to sa y, but t hat™s t rue. My father 
had some mone y with him, and it was a -- he was able to make things a little easier, 
than ma ybe families who fled and didn™t have any cash on them at all. That was t he 
important t hing.  

Q: And that™s how he got you your galoshes. 

A:Got me m y gal oshesand ma ybe got m y motherablanket 
-- m y grandmother and 
m y mother a blanket. I mean, that™s -- that 
--
 t hat -- that™s true. It 
--
 it ™s sad that you 
can™t -- that everything is available if you have the money. 

Q: So the weather got worse, Oct ober, November, December.

A: Mm. 
Q: What di d you do to keep warm, and what did you do during t he day? 

A: Well, in -- we -- we dressed as warm as we could, and I read. Thank God people 

always are wonderful, they bring books. And I -- we sort of circulated all the books 

and I reread t hem again. I mean, you know, there™s alwa ys people -- there are alwa ys 
people who have a sense of knowing that books are i mport ant.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memori al Museum ca -- 
volunteer collection interview with 
Margitta Cooper
. This is tape number two, side
 
A
 and you were talking about your life in 
Gurs
. 
A: The thing about 
Gurs 
was that -- the di scomfort of -- for the -- more for the -- I 
think, for -- for -- for th -- for the women than for the children. Now, t here™s certain 
things that  I -- I found 
--
 I -- I wasn™t bored. I just didn™t 
--
 I -- I just -- 
my 
-- I had 
m y girlfriend al --
 
Truda
 with me and we still  played together and we pla y -- we 
were together. The thing that bothered me i s for example, there was a young wo-

wo
man
 
in our 
-- in our barracks who was handicapped. She had a very severe defor -
- severely deformed hand. And I™m not sure if -- if it -- if -- if -- what happened, but 

one d -- you know, she -- she was gone. I wo 
--
 I came back one da y and I -- 
yo u 
know, when you live in a place, even a child as insensiti ve as I ma y have been, you 

know -- you can sense atmospheres. I mean, there was -- even the 
im 
-- the -- even 

the abnormal at mosphere of being in these barracks became a normality after 

awhile, so when you walk in and you sense another change, you know something 

has happened, and I kn ew somethi ng had happened because I saw -- I did not see 

Becky
. 
Q: And how old was she? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
41
 
A: She may have been 14. She was older t han I was, 14 or 15, pretty child, pretty 
young girl, but she had a very badly deformed hand, like a thalidomide hand. And 

somet
hing was 
-- and I think -- and there was something wrong with t he second 
hand too, but one was really -- and I remember I walked in and I sat down and I 

turned around and I sai d -- I looked around and I saw her mother was sitting like 
with her head bent down and not doing anyt hi ng, and I said, where™s 
Becky
? And 
m y mother saidshh
h. And I said -- well, t hat was not the thing t o say to me, so -- 
unfortunately, so I said, where is
 
Becky
? And she says, 
Margit
, I™m going to hit 
you. Be sti ll. Now that -- when that happened, I said, did she go awa y, and I said 
--
 
m y mother said yes, she went awa y. And I was glad, I was happy, I thought she had 

gotten away. It took me -- yet, I knew. I wanted to believe she had gotten awa y, but I 

m 
--
 sensed there was something wrong. And t hen there was the little girl, beautiful 
little girl who became ill, she was about ma ybe three years old, and she died. And I 

remember th -- the mother screaming in thi s makeshift hospital the y had there, they 

had like a makeshift infirmary, that her body was still warm. She was screaming at 

m y father, saying, she™s still warm. And I remember m y mother was dissolved in 

sobs, I mean, she was hyst er -- well , first of all, to see this mother lose her child, 

well it had to bring back that same trauma for her, plus the fact that there was 

nothing to be done. And I™m sure, under -- given circumstances, she would have

survived. The thing was, eventually my fat her found out, or somehow discovered 
that he coul d get m y brother and I out of 
Gurs.
 And I think that i n every energy he 
had became bend toward that. And then of course the y told hi m that he could -- his 

son could go. My brother, but not me. So my father told them -- and he told me t his -

- that he had two children, they were both going to leave, or neither will leave. He 
said, I™m not letting m y son go and m y daughter is to sta y here. In other words he -- 
what he said to them in effect was, you™re not sending m y child, one child to death 

and not the other. The y bo -- he sa ys, the y™re twins. They belong together, the y 

should go together. And the y let us. So it  was me and my brother. It was my friend 

Truda
 and m y friend
 Gunter K atz
, who were among the four children who left 
Gurs. 
Q: Let™s tal k a little  bit about again y- your life at 
Gurs
 before we get onto the next 
stage.  
A: 
Mm. Mm
-
hm, y
eah.
 
Q: What di d you do during the day, and -- from October to April? 

A: 
Truda
 and I would play cards, somebody had a deck of cards. We would read
. 
We would t alk. We would be outside in the mud, pla ying. I don™t remember what we 

played. We pla yed games that chil dren played. There were no -- I think somebody 

had a ball, we would pl ay with a ball. We tried to pla y things that  were normal. I 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
43
 
would go visit my father as much as I could, my brother and I would. But 
Truda
 
and I spent a lot of time together and we woul d be playing games. I remember we 
would sit on this bench the y had, she and I and pla y cards together for hours on end. 

But of course, any book. Most of the ti me, I would read. Now the chil dren -- it was -

- for the children it had to be -- there was no education. I mean, nobody -- 
there were 
no classes, there was not -- no school, except you know
, my fa 
-- m y mother would 
try, but di 
--
 we di dn™t go to school. We j ust --  it was just  drifting every da y. Get up 
in the morning, get  washed, spend a little time with m y mother. Find 
Truda
, who le 
-- who was in the barracks, in the same barracks, but down, and -- and pla y together 

and then go outside if it was at all permissible, you know, and then go visit the -- 
m y 
father 
an
d then come and stay wit h my parents. It was -- it was a non-existence. The 

only thing that really, really saved me wer -- were the books, was reading. The other 
children -- and when I talked to 
Truda
 about it  she sa ys, what did we do? I said, I 
don™t remember. She says, I know we played some cards. They were -- we™re all i n 
the same boat. It was a non-existence.  

Q: Did your mother or father make any distinction about Friday night? Friday night 

Sha bba t
?  
A: No. You mean 
--
 
you mean 
-- 
oh, ma 
-- m y father did come to conduct a little 
services on Friday night, yeah, for the women, yes he did, yes, yes. On Frida y ni ght 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

he came. And -- and -- I mean, there were -- 
t heholidays, I mean, therewas 
-- oh, 
and I will tell you something else. I was t here for Passover. If a -- if you live to be a 
thousand years old you™re never going to guess who sent the Jews matzo in -- in 

Gurs.
 The Japanese sent boxes of matzos. I swear, it said in the back, 
Nippon.
 Can 
you believe it? It was so amazing, I mean, and we did have matzo for Passover, and 
that™s how I knew i t was Passover, my father told us. And right after t hat I left. But -
- of course, Hanukah came there was nothi ng, you know. 

Q: Who were the guards? Were they French guards and did you understand any 

French?  

A: No, the y were all  Germans and they had their groupies with t hem, they had these 

women who I guess were -- must have been prostitutes, but the y were very 

glamorous. You know, to me the y were very glamorous, t he y were clean, the y had 
polished nails, I mean, you know, and they had them living there. And they were 
German sol diers, the y were all German. They were German soldiers, not 
SS.
 
I think 
the 
SS 
were sort of -- t he commandant ma y have been 
SS,  
but t he people guardi ng -- 

well, the y had a -- t he y had no problems, they had a -- the y had a -- 
a completely 
compliant group of prisoners. I mean, nobody did anythi ng. I mean, t hey -- 
the y had 

nothing to do. The y would sta y in those kiosks, you know, along the highwa y. Th-

There was a highwa y t hat ran down and on each side were -- were the barracks. And 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
45
 
there was really not hing for them to do, and we would be walking on -- on -- on the 
highwa ys once in awhi le, but most of the time we did nothing. It  was -- 
you 
-- 
it was 
impossible to be outside for any length of ti me because of the mud. 

Q: Did any of the women bring Sabbath candl esticks with them?  

A: I don™t remember seeing anythi ng like t hat. I don™t remember seei ng any -- 
anyt hing t hat woul d have reminded them -- remi nded us of 
Sha bba s
 or of the 
holidays, except, as I said, we did get matzo. We knew, and I don™t remember t -- th-
the 
menorah
 or anyt hing being lit. I think by then, whatever there was, the women 
themselves had lost hope, or had -- were beginning to give up.  
Q: Did you and your mother and your brot her sleep together on a pall et? 

A: Yes, and so did my grandmother. Yeah, they -- we had them together. And the y 

were sort of lined up, you know, we had -- 
Q: Did you have enough room, or were you crowded in on the pallet? 
A: I think i t was kind of crowded, but there was a more -- oh, actually, th -- 
oh, m y 

brother was not wit h us, m y brother was with my father. The girls -- 

Q: Oh, so when they separated the children 
--
 

A: -- children 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: -- the y separated the girl children -- 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
46
 
A: Yes, the girls were with -- I mean, the girls were with their mothers and the boys 
were with their fathers
, yeah. But he 
-- m y brother eventually -- I t hink there was a 
problem and m y brother did come t o us, but not in the beginning. And I think one of 

the reasons that happened was because he -- m y brother became ill and m y father 

said he should be with his mother. And, you know -- yet, 
he missed my mother.So 
-
- I mean, he was a little boy, and -- and 
he s 
-- 
came 
-- came with us, and he stayed 
with us and it was fine, you know. He -- t he thing was that -- that m y brother had -- 

had become very quiet. He had completely become -- completely -- he was afraid. 

When we were at 
Gurs,
 I think my brother began to change. I thi nk it -- it -- it -- I 
think the final -- the final straw was 
when we 
--
 when he knew that  we were going to 
be leaving by ourselves, without our parents, that we were going t o be going alone. 

And I think for the chil dren to know that they were leaving without their parents was 
very frightening to them. Because I didn't know. I mean, t he bus 
--
 the truck pulled 
up and there we were. 
Q: How did your father present this to you initially, that you were going to be 

leaving? What -- how did -- do you remember what he said to you? 

A: He said very si mply, you™re goi ng to 
Amer ica
. And here it was, that wonderful 

place I was going to go and my brother was going to go, too. He sa ys, you™re goi ng 

to go to 
America
. What I didn™t know was that if I was going to go to
 
America
, it ™s 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
47
 
because the y were going to be dead. And t hat was the only premi se under which I 
was going to be going to -- I didn™t  underst and that. All I knew, I was going to 

America
 and I really didn™t give a damn what  happened, you know, as long as I was 

going. And I just naturally assumed that as soon as I got to 
Amer
ica
, m y parents 
would be ri ght there -- were coming, you know. And that™s how he presented it to 
me and I was -- I said, fine. I said, I™m going t o 
America
. AndIt old m y brother 
we™re going to 
America
. And the y came. Whatever little cl othing I had which I -- 
you know, was no good any more, packed it up, looked at  all this mud, which was 
now a sea of mud agai n because all  -- everyt hing had thawed out  and it was, you 

know, no longer frozen, it was -- had been col d there. And we got  on this truck, all 

the children.  

Q: Ho-Ho w many children got with you? 
A: I think ma ybe 20. And we drove and drove and drove again. 
Q: What di d you sa y to your parent s when you were leaving? 

A: I said goodbye to them, and you know, the Germans allowed them to sa y 

goodbye to us when we left for the 
United States
, before they took them to 

Auschwitz
. Did you know that? Did you ever hear that? After -- I just -- after I went 

to 
Marjelier
 there, when we finally were allowed to go to the 
United States
, t he y 
took us past m y parents conce -- the concentration camp, near -- 
near 
Po. 
We went 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
48
 
to 
Po
 on the wa y to 
Spain. 
And t he y stopped the train and allowed the parents to see 
us one more time. My parents saw me one more ti me. M 
--
 I didn't even recognize 
m y mother, she was so thin, and my father. And my father gave me a l etter which he 

asked me to destroy, which I should have never destroyed. It was a wonderful letter 

to me sa ying whatever happens, life is for the living, remember we loved you, 
remember us. And I -- I -- I destroyed the letter cause he asked to d -- he was afraid 
that it would be found on me. And he said, you came from a good family. You have 
-- 
you 
-- 
you  
-- 
yo u 
-- 
he 
-- he said, you came from a good family, a 
family who 
loved you. You 
-- we wanted a -- you were -- you should ha -- you™re very bright, 
you deserve a wonderful education. We loved you, both your mother and I. That t his 

has happened was not meant to be, but I want you to have a life and I don™t want you 

grieve. And he sa ys, I don™t want you to hate, because he knew that I would hate, 
and I did. I hated with a passion for years. I mean, I™ve -- I could not forgive it. It 
took me long ti me. I mean, I woul d sa y it took me the bett er portion of m y life to 

look at anything that was German and not wish it the most horri ble things to happen. 

When thali domide happened, to my shame, and I heard there were German babies, I 

felt not a shred of regret. When -- when 
Germany
 was being rebuilt, I felt nothing 
but anger and grief that  this country should -- but then I began to understand what I 

said in the outset of this interview, that human beings are capable, all of them, of the 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
49
 
most horrific things. That we have an innat e sense of cruelty. That  we have what -- 
what -- what -- what is referred to as our rept il ian system that has nev
er matured, 
that has never devel oped, that has never -- that  evolution has never taken care of, 

that re-regresses to this atavistic st ate of absolute enormous cruelty and rage agai nst 

another person. And that™s when I began to forgive the Germans, when I r
ealized 
that there are people in this country who are perfectl y willi ng and able to destroy 
others the same wa y the Germans destroyed us. So when I left 
Gurs
 -- to go back to 
the original  thing --  when I left 
Gurs 
and went  
-- went to 
Marjelier
, t here was thi s 
enormous castle. 

Q: Did you know where you were going? You get on the truck wi th t hese 20 other 

children, who were t he adults with you?  

A: The y had two adults with us who had 
--
 somehow, I think -- t he y were people 
who came to the concentration camp I should say, to 
Gurs, 
who were Jews, who 

were extremely well dressed. One of them was our former teacher, not -- not -- not -- 

it was a former teacher who had taught us at Hebrew school -- I mean, at -- at 

school, who had been a Jew. He was a -- 

Q: Ins -- i
n 
Speyer?
 
A: He was extremely well dressed, so was his wife. I couldn™t understand it, the y 

came to see my mot her. And I afterwards said -- oh, I afterwards said to my mother, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

oh, they look wonderful. I mean, the y were dressed to the nines. So m y fath -- m
y 
mother said somet hing under her breath and I looked at m y 
fa 
-- gr -- 
my
 
grandmother, I said, 
Omar,
 they look so wonderful. He said, the y sold out to t he 
enemy. In other words that they betra yed their own people. The y were one of the 
ones who obviously were able to deal with t he Germans in some wa y, I don™t know 
how. I really don™t know. I™ve never been able to find out or understand how these 
people looked the way the y did. The y were not the only ones. There were others 

who came who were al so German, who were well dressed, who were obviously on 

the side of the Germans, or in some kind of collaboration with them, I do not know. 

I swear to you 
Gai l
, I have never been able to find out. I tried very hard to find out. I 

talked to 
Gunter
 about  it. I -- 
there wa
s -- 
Q: These are German Jews, or German non-Jews? 
A: German Jews. Oh no, the non- Jews I could have understood. But I™ve o -- 
I™m 
-- 
I™m definitely going to find out about it because it -- I hadn™t thought about it for 
years. The y were elegant. I mean, t he
y w
- wore fashionable clothes and the y were 
very patronizing toward my mother. They came to see her really out  of respect fo-

for my father, but t he y were patroni zing. And the y were German. I m ean, the y 

belonged to our synagogue. So could it be -- 

Q: So thes
e are Jews?
 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
51
 
A: Mm. So in some way t he y 
coll abord
 
wa y 
--
 collaborated with t he Germans. Now 
m y question has al ways been, in what way? I mean, what did the y get, how did the y 
escape being interned? How did they escape going to 
Auschwitz
? How did the y 

survive? I mean, it was like the French coll aborators, you know, who -- who -- who 

-- 
like, you know, who sold the 
-- t hemsel ves to the Germans. And this is what t hese 
people had to have 
--
 have done, because the y were Jews. The Christi ans is another 
story, you k
now, but these were Jews. 

Q: But the y were comi ng to save you. 

A: No, the y --  

Q: To save the chil dren? 

A: No, the y -- no, no, no, no, no. The y came to visit us and see sort of -- like the y 

represented the Red Cross kind of thing, but t hey did -- 
nothing ha
ppened, the y j ust 
came. The y came to pay their respects and to see what was going on and how could 
they help, and there was nothing, but ma -- I remember m y mother saying, what do 

you mean, how can you help? You know, she was angry. But the y left again. I mean, 

they were free to come and go as they pleased. The y had come to visit. From where? 

I mean, how do you get  to 
Gurs
 
from 
Speyer
? And why were they not arrested? 
That is -- I have to find -- I mean, I -- I really 
--
 it alwa ys bothered me all these years 
how this could have happened. But you know, it does happen, so either the y

betrayed thei r own people for mone y, or somehow the Germans were using them in 
-- 

Q: Do you remember t heir names? 

A: Yeah, that™s -- no, but 
Gunter 
Katz --
 one of them was called -- was 
Lehrer, 
like te -- like teacher, and his name was 
Lehrer
, but I don™t remember his wife™s 
name, but 
Gunter 
would remember. He absolutely woul d remember. And -- 
Q: So these people had nothing to do wit h your being chosen to leave? 

A: I don™t think so. I think that came from t he -- I think that came from a much -- 
from an international kind of decision by the 
United States
 and other countries. No, 
the people t hat took us to 
Gurs
 were probably -- I -- I mean, took us t o 
Marjelier 
were probably peopl e who were sort of a liaison with all these different programs 

that had -- they were trying to get  some of the children saved, and that we got to 
Marjelier
 and I was very bewildered. And I -- 
you
 know, when the y said it was a 
castle, of course, after I -- I read all t hese books, I expected 
Cinderella
, you know, 
with a -- well, this was not the place. I mean, t his was a big, big place with a huge 

entrance. And very barren, very cold. Not 
--
 you know, i t was set up to take care of 
children. I mean, it was not set up to be a salon or anything like that. And there were 

lots of children there already. We were just m ore. The y had teachers. They had -- 

they had ver -- they were very good to us, I mean, the y were very nice to us. The y 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

spoke French mostly, and that™s how I learned to s -- 
really speak French
 much 
better. And the y tried 
--
 they tried to be real ly -- the y really tried to educate us. I 
think that was one of the big things, the y wanted to conti nue our education and we 

did go to school. Now, they gave me a little plot of ground outside for me to plant 

m y own vegetables. Well, that is the s -- I mean, I can not even grow a weed. So I 
was the only one t hat nothing ever grew for. They were -- 
t h e y 
-- they were -- they 
were nice to us. I mean, there was not -- 
I mea
n they were not gushing and the y were 
not affectionate at all. I think they were doing a job, and I think they were also 

aware of the fact that most of these children were going to be leaving, hopefully, and 

that new ones woul d be coming in. When t he y fina
ll y 
-- now, there were children 

who were grieving t erribl y. There was a chi ld t hat came whose mother died in the 

camp
. She was an only child. She 
--
 
her mother 
-- 
shewas in my 
--
 she was in -- i n -
- in 
Gurs 
with us. 
Q: And the mother died in 
Gurs
?  

A: No, 
the mother diedin 
Auschwitz
, but she was the only child of this mother who 
was either divorced or widowed. It was the most wrenchi ng thing for that child to 

leave her mother and for that mot her to let  her child go. I -- I mean, I -- I have 

children and I™m sure you do too. I keep t hinki ng of handing m y child up on a truck, 

10 years ol d, or 11 years old, and in this l ittle c-
ca 
-- girl™s case, six ye ars old, and 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

sayi ng goodbye and letting them go down a road where you don™t know where 
they™re going. I mean, m y father said 
America
. I don™t think he knew hi mself. The 
courage it had to take, and not to weep, and not to -- and to control yourself and not 

let the child see how s 
--
 how anguished you are. This mother did that. This child 
looked like frozen, like a piece of glass when she sat down. She was beautiful. Black 
curls all over her head and she wore this l ittle clean dress t hat her mother had saved 
for the occasion and she was sitting there and weeping, I me -- 
I me 
--
 like a piece of 
stone with the tears just  falling down her cheek. And terrified, I mean terrified out of 

her mi
-mind. She™d never been alone, she had never left her mother. And she -- she 

was so quiet, you know, she -- her mother had -- must have impressed on her -- she 

was not in our barracks, that she had to do this, she had to go. And she had accepted 

it, but she didn't want t o, you know, she kept saying -- and then that night she kept 
calling for her mother. I mean, she was a li ttle child. And th-the teachers would 
come out and the y would talk to her. As I said, the y were not overly affectionate, not 

doting. They couldn™t be. I mean, there were so many children. And 
--
 
Q: Who were the teachers? 

A: The y were French. I don™t -- I t hink the y were Jewish. You saw -- saw some of 

this. You showed me some of that stu -- they were Jewish. One was a married 

couple for sure because the y shared the room right where we all slept. And you

know something how 
--
 you know, I keep think -- I-I -- you know, for years I -- I 
was very smugly sa ying that these -- that I had absolutely no feelings about this at 
all, that I was absol utely objective, but when 
--
 when the children were starting t o go 
to 
America
 and I wasn™t one of them, there were children that were beginning t o 
leave and the y were going to, quote, 
A
merica
. So one day I™m lyi ng in bed and a 
spider is walking alongside the bed -- 
ara 
-- al ong m y pil low. And I said to m yself, if 

the spider cli mbs on my hand and cli mbs up my arm, I™m going to go to 
America
. 
So the spi der cli mbed on m y hand and cli mbed up -- by now I™d probabl y faint, and 

climbed up my arm and then stopped and then turned around and cli mbed down 

again. And I swear to you
 Gail
, t he next da y they came and said, you and your 

brother are going to 
America
. Of course, what it meant t hat I had si
gned m y 
parents™ death sentence. I mean, not me, but they had -- were going to 
Auschwitz
. 
That was the whole poi nt. These were the families -- the children t hat left 
Gurs
 for 
America
 were -- were the children of parents that had been d-desi gnated for 
Auschwitz
. They had already been named t hat  they would be shi pped to 
Auschwitz
, 

and m y parents -- m y mother was shipped in the transport of 1942, and this was 

1941. So t he y were already designated for that. My grandmother had already died, 

and I didn™t  know that. My grandmother died i n -- in ™42 
--
 I mean, no, she hadn™t 
died yet. She died in February of 1942 and my father -- now this is the thing that I™m 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
56
 
not sure about, m y father I think died in 
G urs.
 I don™t think he di ed in 
Auschwitz
. 
The y have never been able to determine it. On the list it  gives his name too, but -- 
but there are other things that indicate that he died in 
Gurs
, of a massive heart 

attack, probably. 

Q: O-On what list? 
A: On the list of transports from
 
Gurs
, and I have that here, and -- but I™m going to 
have to send you copies of all that. Which means -- which is a horror to me, when I 
think that if m y grandmother -- I have the death certificate for m y grandmother from 

Germany
 -- from 
France
, and if m y father di d die before my mother left for 
Auschwitz
, that meant that my mother went to 
Auschwitz
 alone. And that I find 

unendurable. I™m hoping that if the y went, they went together. But i 
--
 I don™t thi nk 
so, I think my father did go to -- did die there and never got to go -- 
Auschwitz
 -- 
and for him it™s a blessing and for m y grandmother certainly it™s a blessing, she was 

a woman in her 70™s, so -- but for m y mother I find it -- and I™m hopi ng that if -- you 

know, she did go, that t here was somebody wit h her, that ma ybe the 
Alcons
 were 

still there
, because 
Truda 
said her -- of course her parents died in 
Auschwitz
. So 
ma ybe all t he people from 
Speyer
 were sti ll together then, you know. 
Q: 
Marjelier  
was a chateau 
-- 

A: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
57
 
Q: -- and it was southeast of 
Tur.
 
A: Yes, yes, and it was a big place t hat had become a center for -- 
that somehow had 
been given over by 
--
 by t he French, I assume, to take care of these children until 
they could be dispersed into different -- to different places. Now, t his was not 

occupied 
France
 at t he time. S -- what happened was, as --  as -- I was there only a 
few months and what happened wa -- is that  as we left, other children would come. 
Now, were these children -- how many of these children were from 
Gurs
? I think 
most of them came from 
Gurs.
 I don™t t hink t hey came from ger -- 
I think 
-- I -- 
I™m 
not sure what other places the y could have been coming from. I mean, the y were not 

coming from the German concentrat ion camps. I don™t know where else they coul d 

have been coming fr -- to -- to 
Marjelier 
from, because 
Gurs
 was r
eall y 
-- there 
was only 
Gurs. 
Q: Wasthis mar 
-- 
Marjelier
 sponsored by the 
OSA, 
the 
O-S-
A 
-- O-S-E
?  
A: I think so. I think that™s who di d it, yes. And I think they -- they were some -- the 

United States
 I think did offer to take 
X
 number of children. I think t hat™s how t he y 
-- you know, I think they 
--
 it was sort of sponsored, an international kind of thing. 
How it came to be, I don™t know. Certainly when I got there it was already 

established. I mean, we were not the first arrivals, there were children there. 
Q: Did you have any contact with your parents when -- 
once you got to 
Marjelier
?  

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
58
 
A: No --  
Q: Between the ti me you l -- you got there and the ti me you left? 

A: No, there was no contact at all. As I sai d, the only ti me I saw them again was at 

the end, when we left t he country.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memori al Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Margitta Cooper
. This is tape t wo, side
 B
 and I 
had asked you if you had had any communication with your parents bef -- until the 

time that you left, and you said no. So how was that for you and your brother not to 

have this communi cati on with your parents? You were very young. What was t hat 

like?  
A: The thing -- you know, as I s --  the thi ng that was so strange i s that I really felt all 
right about it. I -- I -- I think ma ybe I thought t his was just like a temporary thing. 
And the other thing was that I had become -- 
I 
-- I think I -- 
what ha
d happened is 
that I had become reall y disaffected. I did not realize it, but I think I kind of had 

become like numb. I didn™t think about m y parents except in the expectation that I 

would see t hem, that this was a temporary situation and t hat the y would eventually 

be coming. I didn't thi nk beyond t hat. I would hear little conversations between t he 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

teachersthat would make me 
-- that  would frighten me. For an example, the y were 
talking about what was happening to some of the children, children that had physical 
handicaps. And 
-- and t hat™s, of course, what happened with 
Becky 
-- 
that they were 
doing things. The y were very frightened and very uneasy, even about being in 

Marjelier
. They were afraid of the Germans coming. The Germans had occupied, of 
course, a part of 
France
, 
Vichy, France
 
an
d I would hear little things, that the y 
were always very conscious of being at ri sk or in danger in some way. And that  
made me nervous. And yet I thought, well , I™m 
--
 we here. So if I™m here, and 
Henry
 and 
Heinz 
are here, then m y parents can™t be that far behind. So it didn™t 
frighten me. I didn't begin to understand that t hey were not coming until I saw t hem 

in
 Po.
 And then I knew that the y were not goi ng to be coming with us to 
America
, 

that we were going by ourselves. But until then, when the train st opped and I saw 
the parents, I thought well, this i s it, you know, we™re -- they™re -- they™re coming 
back. We™re going now. We™re going to 
America. 

Q: Did you go to school in
 
Marjelier
? Did they have classes? 
A: Yes.  

Q: What di d you learn? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
60
 
A: The y had classes in history, we took some mat h, we -- but it was all in French, so 
I mean, you know, I -- 
an
-
an
d they taught us how to speak French, of course, and 
children learn fast. And of course there were books, which was wonderful. 

Q: Did they give you clothes? 

A: The y gave us clothi ng, absolut ely, we had no clothing. The y gave us clothing, as 
I said, the y asked us to do -- we did work i n the ki -- we kept our own rooms up, I 
mean the beds -- I mean, there was like a dorm. We made our own beds, we -- 
we 

cleaned. I, li ke an idi ot one da y thought it™d be fun to help scrub t he floors. That 

taught me never to volunteer again. And -- and we worked outsi de and then la -- on 

the -- on the -- in the gardens and grew our own vegetabl es, and it was -- it was -- it 

was an absolutely work place. I mean, you know, the children were not pampered. 

But it -- 
the y 
-- it saved their lives. 
Q: And you had enough food? 
A: Yeah, there was enough food, it was not good. Lots and lots of lentils. I 

remember we were loaded with lentils, lots of legumes, n -- very little meat. Some 

mil k, some bread. Not -- not what you call  haute cuisine. I mean, it was an -- 

sufficient for us to survive on. There was very little fresh food, I mean, no oranges 

and things like that . Somet imes -- I have al ways wondered what t he neighborhood 

thought, you know, what the neighbors must have thought of this place and all these 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
61
 
children, though I™l l -- although it  was pretty i solated, I mean, there were not too 
many neighboring houses there. 

Q: Di-Did you go into t he nearby towns at all? 

A: I don™t think we ever did. I don™t think we ever really left. There were places for 

us to roam around and to play in, but we never made visit s into a-
any neighboring 
towns, unt il we left. Until finally we had to go and we headed for
 Marseilles. 
But -- 

and -- you know, on the train. But  it was 
--
 it 
--
 it -- it -- the children, again, were 
very well behaved. I think all the children knew there was -- 
this was notnormal. 

You know, that we were going through am -- I mean, when you think of children, 

ranging from the age, let™s sa y, of six, seven, to maybe 12 - 13, al l strangers to each 

other, suddenly bei ng thrust into a situati on where the y never saw t heir parents, 

never heard from their parents, having to exist in this wa y and having 
absolutely no 
-
- no knowl edge of what was to become of them. Except for me, I was positive I was 

going to 
America
. My father had said so and I was going. But t he rest of them 
didn™t know. Everybody wanted to go. That was, you know, one of the most 

triumphant  things was was one of the chil dren came to me and said, I™m going to
 

America
. And that™s when the -- ri ght after that m y little spider arrived. So, I mean, 

that was -- it was li ke getting -- you know, it was like going to look at the bulletin 

board in col lege and knowing that you been -- you know, that you™ve gotten the 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

school of your choi ce. This was t he dream of every child there, it was to come t o the 
United States
. 

Q: How many chil dren were there when you were there? 

A: About 80, yeah.  

Q: And you mixed with the other children, besides your friend 
from 
Speyer?
 
A: Oh, yeah. 
We 
-- wel l, my friend from 
Speyer
 didn™t come. She went later.  
Q: Oh.  

A: Yeah, they didn™t come with me. 
Truda
 
an
-and 
Gunter 
came l ater, and 
Truda 
stayed in 
France
 for seven years after that. But she never l eft. The thi ng -- 
I came 

with my brother by m yself, with other chil dren from gu 
--
 from
 
Gurs
, but not 
Truda
. No, she said she -- the y were very upset when I left because t hey thought 
the y would never be able to get out, but the y did eventually. No, these were children 
from everywhere.  
Q: Did you sta y with -- did your brother sl eep near you? 
A:Yeah, m y br 
-- no, m y brother slept with the boys and I slept wit h the girls. And 
there was like huge dormit ories and he was -- you know, and the y would come up at 

night and we were allowed -- the y would t urn lights out and that was it. It was -- it 

was like -- it was li ke 
--
 a little bit like being i n a camp for the poor. 
Q: How was your physical condition, were you a strong child, physical
l y?
 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
63
 
A: Ye -- yeah, well I became ill on the boat. I got rheumatic fever. But I was fine 
then, you know, when I came -- when I -- when I left 
Marjelier
 and I was on the 

transport to 
Marsei lles, 
they took two chi ldren off the train. They were friends of 

ours from 
Marjelier
. And it was a sister -- 
a broth 
-- a brother and a sister and they 
had very bad e yesight, the y wore very thick gl asses. And the train stopped, the 
Germans came and took them off. Now, again, I don™t understand that. I mean, I™ve 
never been able to understand why the ger -- t he Germans allowed these children to 

go to the 
United States
, obviously, or the fren -- no, the fr -- no, the French took 
them off, not the Germans, because we were t raveling through unoccupied 
France
 

at that ti me, til we got t o 
Marseilles. 
It must have been the French that did that, 

because the 
United States
 would not have allowed them i nto the country, because 
the y could not see well . So when I became very il l, on -- on the train, I had the first 
attack, I didn™t tell an ybody anything cause I knew that t he y would t ake me off the 
train. And I was fine when I got to 
Marsei lles. 
And I asked my pediatrician who 

took care of me here, Dr. 
Liebolis 
in -- in 
Maryland
 why it would come like this, 

that I woul d get thi s tremendous p ain. He sa ys -- she sa ys, because that™s what 

happened. She says, it would come, the rum -- rheumatic fever is exactly like that, 

you have these terri ble pains. It affects the heart. And I was fine when I got to 

Marseilles. 
When I got  on the boat  it happened again, and this time was very severe. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
64
 
And again I was afraid to say anything. But when I got to this country, m y brot her 
had a fever, and the y don™t allow you in. 

Q: 
Oka y, well 
--  
A: We™ll go -- 

Q: -- we™ll get to that.  
A: -- 
yeah.
 
Q: So, how did you know you were be le -- you would be leaving 
Marjelier?  
A: The y told -- 
the y came andtol d 
-- the y call ed m y brot her and I into the office of 
the headmistress and they said we™re going -- you™re going to be leaving next week, 
you™re going -- and I said, we™re going to 
America
. And she sa ys, we are going to 
America
. I said, good. And I -- I was going to say to them, well when i
s my mother 
and father coming, but I somehow didn™t. I didn™t. So she said to me, you know, we 
-- gather all your things together, and I did. I i mmediately was ready. I mean, I was 
ready at that moment. And the y came and they were who -- 
they werewhoever we 
-- 
it was a number of chil dren. We all lined up. They had 
an 
-- this car. The y had cars, 

not -- not trucks.  

Q: It wasn™t everybody in 
Marjelier
 at that ti me? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, just a few. There were maybe -- 
how many were 
-- of us came 
on the boat? I woul d say ma ybe 20, that™s about all, came -- 
again, only thepar 
--

children of those parents that had already been designated. And t he y came -- we -- 
they took us in cars. Now, when we got t o -- we went by train to marjel -- to 

Marseilles.
 What happened that was very interesting is that our leaders, there were 

two adults that went wi th us -- and on the train to 
Marseil les
 is when 
Be
rnard
 and 
his sister were taken off, and we never saw --  
Q: The leaders are Jewi sh leaders? 
A: Yes, I t hink they were Jewish. But when -- when we got to 
Marseilles, 

something happened and the y told us to go very quickly down the steps 
because 

there were Germans comi ng in. And whether t hey thought the Germans would stop 

us, I don™t know, but I remember absolute panicking. I di d panic t hen because she 

said, go quickly, quietly, down the steps t o the trains -- to, you know, wherever we 

were going, and we -- we all ran very quickly. And as I was running, I looked up 
and I saw the Germans coming and walking up the stairs. You know, we were goi ng 
down one flight, t he y were coming up another flight and I remember thinking, oh 

God, ub -- because I saw their uniforms, t he yellow uniforms with the swastika and 

the black pants. And that -- I got very frightened cause I thought I would be going to 

America
, and -- you know, and we got --

 Marjelier
 
from April to October?
 
A: -- ‚tober, yes. So then we get on the trai n and -- 
Q: And you were 12 years old? 

A: Yes. I was not 12 yet. I was -- yeah, I was 12, I had turned 12. So anyway, we 

were on the train, and oh -- 
Q: Had you physically matured yet? 
A: Yes, I was just thinking, they had given me a bra to wear, cause I was starting to 

show a litt le bit and I didn™t like t hat. But  anyway, I wore the bra and I was getti ng 

to be -- well, I was not chubby, but -- I wasn™t chubby, but I was always a little 

short. So anyway, one of the teachers had ti lted m y head up like this, one of the 

woman teachers, very nice, I liked her very m uch, and said, you™re going to be a 

very pretty woman. And I never thought that at all, so I said -- I remember thinking 
she was 
cr
 --  oh, she was right, by the wa y, I did turn out to be a very pretty woman 
as I grew up. Anywa y, not -- 
Q: Had you star -- how did you -- had you started to menstruate yet? 

A: No, no, no, no, not 
--
 I didn™t do that until I went to the Cathol ic 
co
-convalescent 
h ome i
n the

 after I had rheumatic fever. Catholics and I have a thing, 
I™m telling you. So anyway, I -- 
we goton the trainto

in -- in 
Marseilles
 and we headed toward the Spanish border, and that™s -- was t he 
incident with 
Po
 
and my parents, youknow. Wi 
-- 

Q: T-Ta-Tal k a little more about that.  

A: Oka y. 

Q: You did a little bit. 
A: Oka y, t h-the trai n stopped and t he y sai d to us, the y sai d that the parents woul d be 
allowed to see their children for five minutes. So all -- 
from 
Gurs
. These were all 
the children from 
G urs
 that were on the trai n. And I looked outsi de and there was 
m y mother and father and the y came on for a minute. My mother hu -- m y other was 

almost silent. 

Q: The y came onto the car of the train? 

A: Yeah, they came int o the -- yeah, we were allowed to go -- the y were allowed t o 
step into t he train, t o the compart ment. And my mother was very quiet. I think -- I 
think she knew. I think she knew. And she hugged me and she kissed m y brother 

and I and she cried a lit tle. And she said, be good. She sa ys, be a good girl. And I 

think the y must have been shocked by how much I™d grown in those few months. 

And then m y father, as I said, gave me the l ett er, he hugged and ki ssed me, and I 

remember -- the thing I remember i s when the train was pulling awa y and I saw 

them standing there, together, how totally forl orn the y were. Even as young as I was, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

I knew that ineffable sadness that every chi ld on the train felt when they l ooked at 
their parents. Not j ust me, we all felt it. We were absolutely saddened. Now 
a c 
-- 
I™m wrong, not all the children™s parents were at 
Gurs
, there were others who came 
to us afterwards and sai d, were these your parents? So they -- not  all t he children 

were from 
Gurs
, some of them were. I think most of them, because I remember 
come 
-- some one of the girls coming in and say, was that  your mother and father 

and I said yes. So it wasn™t her p --  her parents weren™t there. But we all knew that 

pain, you know, that a child feels when they s -- when the y suddenly feel that sense 

of insecurity of not having a parent, a -- 
any 
-- it was very frightening to me, and to -
- I think to m y brother, and the finality of it. And when the letter -- when I read the 

letterto m y brother 
-- m y father was sa ying goodbye, you know, an-
an
-and I knew 
that was it. I™m so sorry I ever tore it up, but it™s gone. Anywa y, we l eft
 Marseilles
, 
now we head toward wonderful 
Spa in
. We pull into ma 
--
 this is -- 
Q: Wh
at was your brot her™s reaction in seei ng your parents, on sa yi ng goodbye? 
A: Devastating, he -- devastating. He was 
--
 I -- 
I™mtelling you,for m y brother the 
-
- these little bits and pieces of life being torn away from hi m devastat ed hi m. I think 

he -- 
he became ap 
-- 
he 
-- h-he -- he looked at this as something that he was total ly 
removed from. He went through al l the motions, but he had absolutely no feeling 

with it. He behaved normal ly, but I think m y brother was very badly hurt by all t his, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

all his life. So then we got t -- we got on the train and it™s traveling, traveling, we 
pull into 
Ma drid.
 Now, we had been given 
Gruyere 
c
heese 
-- cheese, grapes and 
bread by s 
--
 the people in -- in 
Marjelier
. I have never eaten a piece of 
Gruyere
 
cheese in over 60 years. The y were starving in 
Spa in
. 
This was after the civil war
. 
Mother were nursing their children at the depot. Soldiers in rags were walking up 
and down, there was nothing, we gave them all our food. All the chil dren did, we 
handed it through t he windows, never real izing that we were going t o 
Lisbon
 and 
we would have to have nothing to -- well, we did, we all gave our food awa y. I t hink 

partly because we reall y were sick of the 
Gruyere
, too. And the train continued to 
Lisbon
, and we arrived in 
Lisbon
 in thi s beaut iful cit y, have you ever been there? 
You -- 
it™s stil
l there, I s -- have a friend who went. You have thi s vista of the sea, 

the medit 
--  it™s just magnificent, and this beautiful hotel, where the y 
--
 these 
raggedy children arri ved. I™m sure that hot el concierge probably passed out when he 

saw us, all these raggedl y -- bunch of kids who hadn™t been bathed in days, you 

know, arriving. They gave us bread and butter, the best bread and but ter I™ve ever 

eaten, and I™m telling you, the y would bring out tra ys of it, it would be gone in two 

seconds. The y kept bri nging out more and more tra ys of bread and fruit and 

everything and the minute it was -- we just ate like wolves, I mean -- oh, the other 

thing was
, we 
-- we did sta y in 
Marseille
 for about three days and they brought us 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
70
 
food there, too. That™s where we got the 
Gruyere
 cheese and stuff. They brought in 
this wonderful food, I don™t know if it was kosher or not. But -- I mean, that was the 
first time we had really eaten really food -- food since we left 
Germany
. I mean, we 
didn™t -- you know, that we had meat and we had potatoes and we had vegetables, 

and you know, s -- things. And the same t hing in 
Lisbon
. The y brought us all this 
bread an-and cheeses and fruit and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and meals that we 

could actually eat. That night the y showed movies. I had never seen t hese movies. 

American movies. They were in English, I couldn™t understand, but I said, this is 

America
. Well, of course, you know, 
Shirley Temple
, I mean, need I sa y anything 

else? So that was wonderful, those were a wonderful three days because we were 

washed, our hair was washed, we had clean cl othes to put on. But, when I got on the 

boat, I had nothing. I had no underwear, nothing. So I wore -- I used to wash out m y 
underwear at  night and -- and -- and wear it t he next da y and it was very cold. And 
of course, I was already sick, whi ch didn™t hel p, you know? But on the boat -- we 

were supposed to sail on this boat and the boat , we missed it in 
Marseille.
 There 
was a dela y and when we got to 
Lisbon
, this boat had sailed. That boat was sunk by 
a German sub, and we t  -- I would have never made it here. You woul d not be 

listening to this absolut el y scintillating story. I -- 
m y 
-- we took the 
Safir Pinto
 
instead. And we left and I was very, very seasi ck until we got to 
Casablanca.
 And 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
71
 
once we got  to 
Casabl anca --
 oh, and when I was standi ng there, you know, I was 
after -- and you know, being a reader and being very melodramatic, I watched the -- 

the -- the shores of
 
Europe
 recede, and I™m t hi nking to myself, you must remember 
this moment all your life, that you are now leaving. You have to remember this, this 

is an i mportant moment. It™s just like when I saw my parents, I sai d t o m yself, you 
have to remember this, you have to remember them just as they l ooked. You know, I 
wanted to do that, and I did. I™ve never forgott en it. Anywa y, we got t o -- we get t o 

Casablanca
 and we stayed there for -- oh, I di d not see 
Ingrid
 or 
Bogey
, I just saw 
a very dirty island, or dirty city. And then we sailed. It took us 10 da ys to come t o 

the 
United States
. More than 10 days, like 13 days, with one pair of underpants. 

Very strange food, very el egant first class. They had women -- they had a lot of 

emi grants on that boat, ver -- 
again, a very mot ley crew
 of people in first class. 
Women who were very heavily made up and wore very el egant cl othes, and men. 
The y pretty much tried to ex -- ignore us because we™re this ragtag bunch of kids, 

you know, we -- I think we were sort of an object of pit y and -- and also 

embarrassment and guilt, you know? That they were havi ng this wonderful time 

with music pla ying and dancing and everyt hing and here we were with these big 

eyes reminding them what was really going on in 
Europe
, and they didn™t want to 

be reminded. I don™t think -- I don™t know how many were Jews or not Jews, but 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
72
 
nobody wants -- wanted to be reminded. And the y were sort of nice. But I had m y 
first love affair on the boat because the son of the captain was on the boat, and he 

liked me. And he™d sneak little thi ngs for me. That™s when I first began to 

understand th
e i mportance of being a female, and what it -- it -- you can derive out 

of that. I got great oranges, all peeled and beautiful. I got wonderful sweets and ice 
cream. I mean, he got me lots of goodies. And I -- 
Q: H-How old was he?  

A: About 13. I was 12. An
dhereally liked me.Hewould talkto me. We didn™t 

understand one word, I mean he spoke Portuguese and I spoke whatever. But we 

understood each other. And I would be sitting there and he™d come up and the 

steward would be traili ng behind hi m and he™d open up t his thing and there would 

be wonderful goodies, and I was -- became very powerful then. Then we got to the 
United States
 -- oh, they posed us -- oh, go ahead. 
Q: How many children were on the boat wi th you in your group? 

A: I™d say about 40. About 40, I think, yeah, not that many. Yeah, about 40 because 

we -- when we landed you know, they posed me -- the newspaper, American 

newspapers posed me. It must be still there in -- it™s in the archives of the
 New York 

Ti mes 
for that da y. They posed my brother and I on the rail of the ship behind the 

Statue of Liberty. The American reporters came to interview us because the y heard 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
73
 
that the children had come from 
E uro pe
. And that™show my Uncle
 
H einz
 found 
out, he opened up t he 
New York Times 
and t here on the front page was his niece. 
Q: Now what day, this is October? 
A: October -- it was October the seventh, I think. Anywa y, there was his niece 

sitting there with her -- m y brother. He -- he cried. My uncle, again, also cried. 
Anywa y, t he y took -- 
Q: O-On t he ship, did you have any classes, or it was just free ti me? 

A: Oh no, nothing like that. No -- 

Q: No English classes?  

A: -- no, no, no, but when the -- when the e 
--
 nothing. We did nothing but roam the 
ship, pla y and do whatever and sit and read. Course again, I found books, which was 

wonderful. 
Q: Did you have your cha -- your ho -- your own books with you? Had you been 
able to take them? 

A: No, no, no, I brought nothing with me. As 
--
 I got on t hat ship without anything. 
We had little satchel maybe of something, but when I left 
Lisbon,
 I really had 

nothing. I mean, I think I had one change of cl othing and I really didn™t have any 

under things at all. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
74
 
Q: When di d you have to give up your personal books that you had brought with you 
from -- 

A: I left them in 
G urs
 for the children, for everybody else that was left. I never took 
them with me. No, I would never have done t hat. That™s one thing we learned to do 

is that we had to -- whatever we could leave for somebody else to use, it became 
instinctive and we all did that. It™s like when we gave all t he food to the -- to the 
Spaniards, I mean, it was just instinctive t o do that, we had learned to do that. 

Anywa y, when we got on the 
Uni ted States
, when the immigration people came on 

board and the doctors, they took my brother™s t emperature and ma -- he had a li-little 

temperature, so we had to go to this place in -- in -- in 
Queens
 or
 Brooklyn
 that was 
like a rehabi litation 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Wa 
-- wa -- tell me, before that, what was it like for you to see the Statue o
f 
Liberty? 

A: I hadn™t -- didn™t  have a clue. I just thou -- looked at this big thing. I mean, I 

didn't know what it was supposed to be. Everybody -- I mean, I heard them sa yi ng 

Statue of Liberty, Statue of Liberty
 
and I knew 
liberté 
means liberty. And I didn™t 
know what  these report ers were all doing around us and t hen he -- one of them 

hoisted me up on t he rail and he hoisted up m y brother and the y all  yelling and they 

all talking, and this -- t he interpreter is trying t o sa y things and t he y were taking 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

these pictures. He sa ys -- and I do remember this, I understood, how do you like 
America
? Are you an 
--
 
an
-and I di dn™t understand and I kept sa yi ng yes, yes, you 
know, 
oui , oui
. I didn™t  have a clue. And -- 

Q: What was it like when you first got off the -- 

A: It was 
[i ndecipherable]
 that boat -- huh? 
Q: Oh -- oh -- oh -- and then when you got off the boat and got onto t he land?  

A: When I got off the boat and on the land, the thing that absolutely -- absolutely 

stunned me is as we walked -- drivi ng through the streets i s the outside of the food 

stores. The fruit pil ed up. I could not i magine t hat human beings had that much t o 

eat. I mean, t he -- the abundance of everything, and the wa y peopl e were walking 

around and the yelling and the screaming and the waving and -- and you know, we 

were driving through a Jewish sect ion, you know, it was probably like the East Side. 
I mean, the exuberance of this country, after al l the quiet and -- and -- and -- and t he 
desolation and the grieving and the mourning that I™ve been subjected to for the last 

four or five years, you know, that unconsciousl y I had absorbed. And now suddenly 

seeing all t his life and t his -- the -- the abundance is what -- what did it for me. I 

mean, I -- I saw oranges this big and people di dn™t pa y -- I saw a woman eating an 

ice cream cone. I hadn™t seen an ice cream, I didn™t even know what i t looked li ke 

any more. And the thing I fell in love with was chewing gum. The driver of the car 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
76
 
says, would you li ke chewing gum? I couldn™t understand what chewing gum was, 
but he handed me t his t hing and he showed me and I chewed it and I loved it. And I 

-- it -- I -- and it was just wonder 
--
 I mean, everyt hing was exhilarati ng to me. I 
didn™t -- again, I di dn™t realize, you know, t hat this was the prologue t o m y life here.  

Q: So it was you and your brother in the car, and who else? 
A: Oh, and all the other children. It was like a van, like a station wagon, you know. 
We were like in a big bus kind of thing, and they were taki ng us t o this 
place where 
-

- where there was like a little hospital, and it was really an orphanage, but a very 

high class orph -- very nice. And t he y kept  us there until we could go with foster 

parents, til m y fost er parents could take me in 
Balti more. 
You know, I came -- went 

to foster parents, m y brother and I. You didn™t know that? Yeah. So anywa y, I -- th-

that™s --  
Q: So you stayed in thi s -- this orphanage for how long?  
A: Oh, about two or three days. And then t he m 
--
 the -- t he -- Mrs. 
--
  
Q: What was the name of the orphanage, do you know?  

A: Mrs. 
Beser 
came from 
Baltimore
, who came with the associated Jewish 

charities. She was t heir liaison wi th all this and she came and 
got m y brotherand I. 

Her son was the nav -- navigator who dropped the atomic bomb on 
H iroshi ma, 

Jacob Bes
er
. Yeah,  and he never recovered from that, which I can well understand. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

Anywa y, she came and she got us and on the trip to 
Balti more --
 I had no idea -- oh, 
inthe meanti me, my Uncle
 Heinz
 
cameand m y Uncle 
Adolf,
 t he y couldn™t take us 
for some reason or other what had to do cause the y weren™t citizens themselves. And 
m y father™s family came and wanted us and I decided not t o, which was the biggest 

mistake I ever made in m y life. I did not want to go with these people, I didn™t know 
who the y were, I -- 
I 
-- 
Q: The y ga -- the y all came to the orphanage? 
A: Yes, and -- which was sad because I should have gone with them. The y were m y 

father™s -- but my uncles didn™t want me to go with them because they didn™t think 

they were hi gh class enough. The y were real  German snobs and my poor father was 

Polish, so the y never re -- the y forgave hi m because he was so smart, but they could 

not forgive these peopl e. Anywa y, it was a big mi stake. Anywa y, went to 
Balti more,
 got another attack of m y little rheumatic fever, which I didn't 
understand, and thi s ti me it -- it got better but  it didn™t sta y better. I ended up going 

to
 
Sina i
 Hospital  in 
Balti more
. And I met my foster parents. The y were probably 
good people, but I think were doing it for the wrong reasons, the y were doing it for 

financial reasons, with some compassion.

sid
e 
A.
 You have arrived in the 
United States
 and Mrs. 
Beser
 came and took y -- 
and then you were t old you were going to 
Baltimore
? 
A: Mm-hm. And 
--
 and I -- well, I became il l on the train again, you know, that -- 
that last -- I think it  was like the last attack, that was like t he third one. And again I 

kind of tried not to give into it because I was still very frightened, but it really kind 

of overwhelmed me and eventually I ended up going to 
Sina i
 Hospital. I s -- 
Q: Thi-Thi- This is the train from 
New York
 to 
Balti more
? 

A: And then I -- I-
I wentto meet 
--
 
Q: In -- 
in October 1941. 
 
A: Right.  

Q: So you are 12 years old? 

A: Yeah. And what  happened was I was il l. I met my -- 
I did 
-- I met  my new foster 
parents that night, and as I said, part -- the y had various reasons for doing it. I don™t 

think the y were the right reasons and I don™t think the y were the right people for us. 

My brother eventually went to another foster home, and so did I. But  they were not, 

in any wa y, abusive. My foster father, unfortunately devel oped an affection for me 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
79
 
which wasn™t quite what it shoul d have been. It wasn™t paternal, let™s put it that wa y. 
So it was 
--
 it was not a great experience for me, but it wasn™t horrible either, I 
mean, nothing terri ble happened to me, except  that I did go to the hospital, I coul dn™t 

speak Engli sh, I -- t he y were very concerned t hat the y di dn™t -- couldn™t -- didn™t 

know exactly what was happening to me. I had a wonderful pediatrici an who was 
taking care of me. Her name was 
Luc
ille Liebolis
, and she™s 
very wellknown. And 
-- and I was at 
Sinai 
Hospital in 
Balti more
 and a lot of young doctors came in and 
tried to speak to me and I couldn™t  really understand them. And finall y a -- a rabbi  
came in from 
Oha
v Shalom
 and he was doctor -- oh God, he was a rabbi before, 
Rabbi
 Shaw, 
I can™t even remember his name, but he had come in and said he had 

met  m y father in -- in 
--
 in 
Germany, 
and he spoke to me in what was passable 
German, and so he finally explained to me what was happening t o me and why I was 
there, and what the y were trying to do to me, because I wasn™t sure what -- what 
they were doing. Anyway, I sta yed there for si x weeks. After I came out of there -- 

Q: Did your foster parents continually visit you? 

A: Once in awhile t he y did come, yes. Absolutely they came. 

Q: What about your brother? 

A: My brother did too. But -- but what happened in between is that the 
United 

States
 went to war. And I remember all the brouhaha that was going around. I had 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

become friendly with t he little girl  next -- in t he cubicle next to me who had had 
polio. And that was really horrible what the y were doing to her because the y were 

using the kes -- Si ster 
Kenny™s
 system with t he hot towels. Anywa y, she and I 
became friends and m y favorite occupation wi th her was singing, ﬁYou A
re My 

Sunshine.ﬂ We sang it day and night, we drove everybody insane. But I heard all this 
going on and somebody explained to me and I was speaki ng a litt le English, that the 
United States
 was at war. And somebody came in and sai d to me in Yiddish, t he 

Uni
ted States, 
it i s 
krei
g,
 is at war, and he said -- I mean, I said, e -- yes? He sai d, 
we are at war with 
Japan
 and 
Germany
. And I couldn™t understand t hat, I thought 
everybody was at war. I didn™t reali ze the 
Uni ted States
 were not  at war, I thought 

the whole world was at -- that wasn™t -- that was no big deal. Anywa y, that™s what 

happened when I was in the hospi tal. I came out, I went to a convalescent center, 
Saint something i n 
Catonsville 
i n maryl 
--
 in 
Balti more
, and 
--  
Q: Did you know Yiddish? 
A: No, but  the words, t he many words that are similar in a di -- you know, the y are 
close. I couldn™t speak -- I only sp -- 
only sp
oke German, but there are people who 

speak Yiddish who can make themselves understood very easily. Anyway, I went to 

this Catholic convalescent home and I sta yed t here for another six weeks, altoget her. 

Then the y t old me at that time, Dr. 
Liebolis
 told me I would never have children, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
81
 
that I had a very bad heart. I went t o the 
William S. Baer 
School for crippled 
children wit h horrificall y handicapped chil dren, but very nice. I -- it was a very nice 
experience for me. They were very nice to me. And I -- then after that I went to 
Western 
High School. I sat for a scholarshi p t o 
Barnard
,butI met m y husband 
--  
Q: Well,nowwait a minute, yo
u --  you -- so you went to live with your foster 
parents after you got out of this -- 
A: Yes.  

Q: -- special  school?  

A: Yeah, yes -- oh yeah, I went back to them, but th -- 

Q: What were the nam es of your foster parents? 

A:

Ceil Snow hite
. I know. Yeah, I 
couldn™t bel ieve it either once I understood what the word meant. Anywa y, I did go 
back to them and then I was transferred out from t here to another fost er family 
called 
Maniken
, where I met my husband, because he had been their foster child, 

too. My husband 
--
 

Q: Wa 
-- wa -- 
why 
-- why did you leave snow -- the 
Snowhites? 
A: Because Mrs. 
Beser, 
I think they all decided that it was not a good situation. She 

had another child. They were a very young couple, and they had anot her baby and 

they really had no room for me. I mean, once the baby came the y needed the rooms.

My brother had already gone by then to another foster family, the 
Kol ectors,
 and I 
went to the 
Ma nikens, 
and -- 
and m y husband hadcomefrom 
Germany
 in 1938. 
There were t wo brot hers, 
Walter Grunberg
 -- 
m y maidennameand m y married 
name became the same. And I know, it™s a -- 
yo
- you™ve got the weirdest interview 
here e 
-- in history. And his brother 
Manfred 
had come. His brot her
 
Manfred 
had 
enlisted in the American army and was kil led as a navigator, he was shot down over 

Germany
. If that is not  irony I cannot tell you what else would be. Anywa y, 
Wal ter 
was there. She had t aken the boys in -- she took five German boys, German 

refugees, Jewish children, in. 
My 
-- the two 
Grunberg  
brothers plus thethree 
Mann 
brothers. There were three brothers there. So t here were five altoget her. Well, the y 

were all gone by the time I got there, the y were all either i n the servi ce -- the only 

one that was left was
 Walter
 and I hated hi m and he hated me and we never got 
along, unti l one day when I was about 17, he says, you doing anything? I said no. He 
sa ys, I™ll take you t o the movies, I said oka y. So he went  -- 
hetook me toa movie 

with his friend 
Frank
. 
My date consisted of me trailing behind -- behi nd them, 
while the y were talking to each other. They never looked at me, never talked to me. 

I remember t he movie, was called ﬁ
The Jolson Storyﬂ
 with 
Al -- 
and I came 
-- then 
when -- what ha -- I don™t know what happened -- oh, I know, we -- he sa ys, you 

want something to eat? I said yes. So we went to 
Nate™s 
[indecipherable]
, which

was a very famous deli  in
 Balti more
, and
 
Frank
 sa ys, I™ve got t o go. So, he left and 
Walter 
and I s -- began to speak t o each other for the first time li ke human beings, 
instead of snarling at each other all the time. And I really liked hi m. And he really 

liked me. He had been engaged before, didn™t work out, and he was very handsome. 

He is m y children™s father. And we started goi ng out. Mrs. 
Manik
en
 was outraged. 
Not for any sexual reasons. Not because she thought I was not going to be a -- 
you 
know, that there was going to be anything pornographic going on under her roof, or 

anyt hing obscene or that I was doing anyt hing bad, no. 
Walter
 was very generous 
financiall y. He bought her lots of gifts, he had no obligat ions, he was working. So 

she wasn™t too happy about that. But he asked me to marry him, and I said yes, for 

all the wrong reasons.  

Q: How old were you t hen? 
A: I was going to be 18. I didn™t deci -- I was not the -- which meant I was not going 
to go to college, I was going to be married. So -- 

Q: And he was how ol d? 

A: 
Walter
 was 24. He was born in 1925, so he -- he was four years older than I was, 

so he was --  no, if I was -- he was about -- he was born i n 1923, I™m sorry, ™23, I was 
born in ™29, he was six years older t han I was, so he was about 24 then, al most 24. I 

wanted to be my own person. I wanted to be free. I didn™t 
--
 I didn™t want to live

under anybody™s roof any more. I wanted t o -- I -- you know. So I married
 Walter
. I 
cared about hi m, he was a very nice -- he was a very decent man, and he alwa ys 
loved me til the day he died. I had my son about two years later, which was 

wonderful. Then I had my daughter four years after that, and then I wanted a 

divorce, for no imaginable reason under the sun except I wa -- had met a 
psychiatrist. He promised me the earth and the moon and I thought, I don™t want to 
struggle any more, I want everythi ng easy. I was very i mmature. That™s where 

children who are -- have to grow up so quickly, in one aspect of their l ives and have 

no chance 
to mature in thenormal things 
--
 I did not have the chance to be a chil d, 
ha -- be a teenager. I never had the t ime to do any of those things. I was catapulted 

from one event to another. And adjusting to new people, adjusting to more new 

people, adjusting t o a school, learning a language. There is no excuse. I™m not 
making any excuses for m yself because that™s not the reason I™m sayi ng it. I™m 
si mply sa yi ng that  behavior that i s aberrant among people -- from people that have 

gone through a lot of trauma has -- there are explanations. You don™t have to forgive 

it and you don™t even have to put up with it, but you have to know that it™s going to 

happen. And it did happen with me. I was si mply not prepared to be a mother. I was 

-- I love m y children, I adore them. And my children, for some reason, think that I 

walk on water. And I al ways tell them I don™t understand that because I was really

temptedto drown both of youa
t bi rth, you know? But the thing i s that  I have done 
that with my children simply because I love them and respect them. B ut I was not a 

great mother, I was not a doting mother. I was totally self-absorbed, alwa ys. It took 

me years to understand that there was a world outside of me, my feelings, m y anger, 

m y rage, what had happened to me. Not poor me kind of thing, I never felt that. I 
never felt, oh, poor me. I always realized how lucky I was. But -- but the self-
absorption was unconscious. I didn™t realize it . And so m y marriage failed because 

of that. I then -- 

Q: Ca-Can we back up a little bit? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: When the war was over in 1945, you were 16 about -- 

A: Yes.  
Q: -- 
Iguess. What was 
-- what did that mean t o you?  
A: I wanted to find m y parents and that™s t he first thing I did, I went t o the Red 
Cross. And the y came back and sai d m y parents had died, both. They gave me the 

news that m y parents were both dead, but they gave me the wrong dates. The y told 

me my parents 
-- and for years I carried that burden -- 
the y told met hat m yparents 
had died in Ma y of 1945, maybe 20 da ys before the war was over, which I fi -- 

again, found intolerabl e. If I had known the y had died in the begi nning of 19 -- in th 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

-- in 1942, when there was no end to the war i n sight, it wouldn™t have been so 
horrific, but for me to realize that, you know, they could have lived another 20 -- 

well, i -- that was a mistake, the y had made the mistake. It was one of those things 

that happened. But they told me t hat both my parents were dead. And -- 

Q: What -- be-besides t he ti ming of it, what were your reactions? 
A: Well, m y reactionwas 
-- it only fed int o my rage and anger. I mean, it only fed 
by what was now, by now a full grown hate for -- for what happened to m y parents, 

the fact that -- that this was done to them, and a -- 
a 
-- 
that people 
-- I mean, I was 
angry at the 
United States
. I found Jews in the 
United States
 are forg -- unforgiving 
-- I -- I wa -- I was unforgiving toward them. I felt that the y were t he smuggest, most 

complacen
t 
--
 I attacked them vici ously, I mean, with venom. I™d sa y, don™t you ever 
talk to me about your friend Mr. 
Roosevel t.
 I said, don™t you ever talk to me and 
commiserat e to me about what happened in 
Euro pe
 
while you were allsitting here 
doing absolutely n othing while your peopl e were dying in concentrati on -- where 

were your marches t o 
Washington?
 I mean, I railed and ranted for years. And I 
really made 
--
 I mean, I have a lot of friends, and that the y took this crap from me -- 
I mean, I™m talking about people li ke
 Elai ne.
 I mean, they™ve been m y friends for 

over 50 years. They took it, and t he y absorbed m -- m y anger and their guilt. 

Because the y didn™t have anything -- it was their parents, t he y were young

themselves, but I -- you know, I used to go on and on on m y littl e soap box. Now I 
realize, it™s going on he -- I™m sitti ng here, what am I doing for 
Israel
? I™m sending 
them a few checks? Am I raving and ranting and railing and running to 
Washington 
sayi ng do somethi ng? No. For m y people? No, I™m just as complacent as these 

people were. The wheel is round. My husband always sai d that and he is right. I 
personally would like t o see Mr. 
Arafat
 writhe in agony, but it ai n™t gonna happen. 
So, I mean, it -- it 
--
 life goes on. Anywa y, I got married, I had my children, left m y 
husband, remarried again, disaster. Met my thi rd husband who was the gem. He was 
wonderful, as 
Walter
 had been. And then I went to wor -- when I was married, after 

m y relationship wi th my psychiatri st broke up and oh -- and I realized it wasn™t 

going to work, I went to work for the school of medicine, 
Johns Hopkins
, which 
was one of the highlights of my life. I went to work for 
A. McGee H arvey, 
who was 
-- who was chairman of the depart ment of medicine, physician and chief of 
Johns 
Ho pkins 
Hospital and the editor of the Journal Medicine. And the 
McGee 
-- A. 

McGee Harvey 
building is named after him at 
Johns Hopkins 
Hospital. And I went 
for an interview, and I walk into this room, and this little man is sitting there behi nd 

this absolutely cluttered desk in this rather -- rather uni mpressive office. And I 

shook hands with him, I had wore kid gloves. I shook hands wit h him and sat down. 

I had failed the test that  the employment agency had given me. There was a big red

X
 right across th-
the exam 
that she had sent out. And I saw it lying there and I figure 
why is he seeing me? So he -- we were chatti ng and he asked me about everything 
and I said --  to everyt hing he asked me I said no, cause I di dn™t know. So then I went 

home. I get this call  from this man, this personnel director of the 
Hopkins
 
and he 

says, Mrs. 
Grunberg
? I said yes. He sa ys, wel come to 
Johns H opkins. 
I said, you 
mean  
he -- t he y hired me? He said yes. I said, who is that little man? I said, who is 

this Dr. 
H arvey? 
Well, there was dead silence like m y asking do you know who 
president -- who the president is. He sa ys, that is Dr. 
A. McGee Harvey, 
v ery,  very 

coldly. He sa ys, he is physician and chief of this hospital and chai rman of the 

department of medicine, and professor of medicine. He is the -- the professor or 
medicine. I said oh. I said, I™m so glad you di dn™t tell me that beforehand because I 

would have fainted right there on the spot . Years later -- oh, when I walked in there 
was another man sitting in a corner, his name was 
Ken
neth Zei ler. Ken Zeiler 
is 
one of the geniuses of all time, he was chief of endocrinology. Years later I said to 
Ken, 
why did ha -- 
Mark 
hire me? He sa ys, you walked i n, you shook hands, you 

sat down, you looked li ke a lady and you spoke English. I said, not well. He said but 

you 
-- he sa ys, believe me, you did. It was -- you know, and then the other thing that 

was funny about
 
K en,  
I saw hi m maybe 10 years ago, I said, 
Ken
, I said, you know 
you were al ways one of my most favorite people. He was also a full professor. He

says, did you know I was in love with you? I said, what? He sa ys, I loved you for 
years. I said, 
Ken
, you are married. He says, I know. I sa ys, there was never -- he 

says, you never knew, he sa ys, you never reali zed, he says, but I al ways loved you. I 

said, you are joining that long list . Anywa y, that was wonderful, he trained me to be 

a redactor, you know, and -- and -- 
with manus 
-- for 
manuscripts. He put meon the 
internship committee, on the residency comm ittee, I was in charge of the 
Lilienthal 

library. I mean, he really trained me and gave me wonderful, wonderful ti me. And 

then m y husband said t o me, it™s t ime for you not -- I™d like you t o stop working. He 

said, you don™t need to financially -- but the mean -- 
inthe meanti me m y mother™
s 
brother died, my Uncle
 Heinz
, and left me money, which was very ni ce of him. And 
he left it to my brot her and m y cousin and I, and he was very well-to- do, he was rich 

man. And he -- we split  it three wa ys. And -- and my husband was comfortable, so I 
didn™t -- but I -- I said, okay. We joined the cumtr -- country club. I became like an 
adult camp 
--
 you know, we™re going shopping toda y, we™re playi ng bridge toda y, 
we™re doing mahjong t oda y. The skirts are too long, the skirts are too short, they™re 

wearing boots, the y™re not wearing boots. Finall y got to the point I was going to lose 

m y mind. I said to my husband, I have to go do something. So I called 
Ira Morri s
, a 

friend of mine, a doctor at 
Ho pkin
 -- 
from 
Hopkins
, who had formed a medical 
group down in east
 Bal timore
, whi ch is a very poor area. And he was doing the 
--

not an 
HMO
, but si milar to that, but poor, for the poor. And that™s where I met
 
Ellen.
 Wonderful da y, 1976. She was the -- there was 
A-
Annabel
le Scher, Richard 
Scher 
--
 do you know 
Annabell e
 and 
Ri chard
 
Scher
? He does news, he was t he 
anchor and 
Annabelle 
was there, 
Ellen
 was there, and I went to work for 
Ira. Ira 
is 
her dear friend and my dear friend and he™s t he one she talks to now all the ti me 
about this. I called up 
Ira,
 I said, 
Ira
, I need t o do something. He says, what do you 
want to do, darling? He called me t he countess. He says, Countess, what do you 
want to do? I said, I want to work a couple da ys a week. So he sai d okay. So we 

went -- I went to work in east 
Balti more, 
which was run by the state and fu -- really 
funded by t he state, for really the -- the -- the 
--
 you know, really people who on 
Medicaid, you know. And 
Ellen
 was sort of there the psychologi st cum whatever. 
And -- and that™s how I met her and sh -- it  was wonderful. I mean, it was a 
wonderful job, I loved it. I worked there for li ke two, three da ys a week. And of 
course I kind of became the -- like, you know, I became the administrator, I became 

the hot honcho. And that fell apart. 
Ira
 and the state and Senator
 Douglas
 from the 

state of 
Maryland
 parted company. Not -- not  -- not the --  not -- the state senator. 

And he f ormed the east  -- the central  
[indecipherable]
 medical group and I went 

with hi m, uh-huh, and stayed there for about another 10 - 
12 years. 
El len 
did not  
come with that, 
Ell en
 t hen, when the whole thing fell apart, it was a very ugly scene, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

with a lot of newspapers and I was interviewed again, do -- you know, the whole 
thing. Anyway, I went to work for hi m and then m y husband died. That was tr-

tremendous trauma for me. He died in 1980, and that was very hard. I f -- think that 

when you l ose a mate, and I™m not pontificati ng, I don™t think anybody whose never 

-- whose -- until you™ve been there, it is probabl y the singlest greatest  loss that you 
can experienc e. Even --  I think even in sit uations where the marriage hasn™t been 
that steadfast. And people, you know, alwa ys say that, but the y don™t understand 

why a person who™s lived with somebody for 30 years and has never had a nice 

word to sa y about him all of a sudden is wailing and -- and weepi ng all over place. 

Well, I™ll tel l you why t hey do. I understand. It™s because t hat person is no longer 

there, it has become an attachment. It™s like somebody severing a part  of you. And 

that is why suddenly this person 
becomes saint 
-- saintly. Well, I happen to have 
liked m y husband, so it  was really, really hard. And --  

Q: Do you think it was harder because you had lost your parents? 

A: Oh, I think so, I think it™s -- a loss for me has always been difficult. And it -- 
I™m 
basically -- the thing I discovered about m ysel f, which is the final result of all that 

has happened to me, is that underneath all t he bravado, and underneat h all this -- this 

-- this -- that m y friends and my children t o this da y believe that I am the strongest 

person the y know. I mean, the y admire that -- t hat underneath all that I am the most

fearful, insecure, qui vering mass of jell y you have ever seen. And they don™t 
understand that. I am terrified of everything. And that came much l ater. That did not 

come when I was young. When I was young I had that audacity. I decided to leave a 

husband with two children. I had the guts t o do all that. The -- th-t he -- the -- the 

thing came as I began to understand and as I began to take m y life apart and look 
at
 
it. If I had kept it set in concrete the wa y it was, without ever chiseling away at that -

- that -- that -- that --  that thing that I encased everything i nto. If I hadn™t broken that 

thing apart to look at it, what was i n there, if I kept it encapsulated, I wouldn™t be so 

fearful. But I think in doing that I unleashed, li terally, the fear that --  and -- and -- 

and -- and --  and the terror that I experienced as a child, that I was -- t hat I just 

buried, and -- and cl osed up and -- and -- and 
--
 until it became hardened. And that™s 
what -- that™s what I did. I don™t -- I™m not  sorry I did it because i n a way it set me 
free in other areas. I don™t -- I™m not so consumed by anger any more and I don™t  
tend to be as judgment al as I used to be. You know, I -- 
I us
ed to be very critical of 

people. When the y talked about the war I looked at them with the ut most superiority 

and sa y, well you don™t  even know what it is, you know? But now I don™t -- 
but now 

I do know. I think the y -- I do know what that i s that the y felt duri ng t he war. It ma y 

not have been of the -- the -- the -- t he epic proportions t hat we did, who were there,

over there, but certai nl y t he y suffered, too. Children whose fathers went overseas, 
and you know, who were left here, alone. 

Q: When your chil dren were young, and the age that you were then things started to 

get difficult and your father was taken awa y and then you were -- did this bring -- 

did thi -- 
di
-did thi s trigger memories for you when your children were the age you 
were in 
Gurs, 
or -- 
you
 know?  
A: Oh yeah, I think so. I think there were times when I would watch my children, 

and I woul d think about it. I would -- I remember when -- when -- when 
Bonnie, 
I 

think was like -- when I took 
Bonnie
 to school the first ti me, more so than 
Mark
, 
becau
se 
Ma rk 
went to school happily. I mean, he would 
--
 he -- he ran awa y from 
me to get into class. But
 Bonnie
 
--
 when 
Bonnie
 -- I took 
Bo nnie 
to school and I 
saw her wal k awa y 
for the 
-- for one moment I felt the anguish that my mother must 
have felt, that I thought  about it, I said, my God, she™s only going away for four 

hours. I feel this pain of separation. How coul d my mother have done it? And then 

when I thought about my -- th-then wh-when they did t hings, li ke when -- I 

remember
 Mark
 when he was littl e, ran awa y once. He wandered off with a chil d. 

In those da ys we were not afraid of the kind of things that we™re afrai d of now, I just 

was nervous and I was pregnant with
 
Bonnie
 and when he came home, the first 
thing that came out of his mouth was, di d I miss the Good Humor man, Momm y? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

But again I felt that anguish, that fear, you know, that something had happened to 
the -- that -- wa -- are my children safe? Every -- I remember the scare with -- with 

Kennedy
 and the -- and the 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: The Cuban -- the Cuban Missile Crisis? 

A: -- Missile Crisis. I was at 
Hopkins
. My children were in school. I remember 
thinking i -- what are -- 
howamI gonnafind m y children? Where arem y children 

going to be? If there™s a -- an attack, how will  I ever get home. And I tr -- I was 

trying to give instructions to m y children what they shoul d do. Don™t leave. I will 

get to you. Daddy and I will find you. But the t hing was again, I thought all the ti me, 

m y chil 
-- I can tell m y children I™ll try to get t o them, because I have the ability. My 
mother coul d not leave that camp t o come and get me, no matter what happened to 

me. If they told her your child is very sick in 
Marjelier
, m y mother couldnot walk 
out the door and sa y, well, I™m goi ng to my daughter, she needs me. I  cou -- had t he 

freedom to go to m y children, and I alwa ys tol d m y kids that. I al wa ys told them that 

y 
-- what -- when you see anything done by state -- 
by 
a state, if you see a lynching, 
or if you hear a cross being burned on a lawn, that™s one t hing. That™s a terrible and 

ugly thing, but if you ever hear -- if you ever see this government pass a law, by 

state, by state, that affects you, you get out. You do not wait, you run to the nearest 

exit. And they said -- 
they didn™t understand. Isaid,itis when
 
a government 
-- when

a head of state makes a statement against a group of people, it gives all the rest 
permission to act against that group. So if you ever hear a st ate -- head of state make 

a statement, or if y 
--
 Congress ever passes a law that™s ini mical t o a group, you 
leave. You go wherever the y will take you. You get out. Yeah, as my children grew 

up, I was very conscious of that. I always told them how grateful they should be, and 
how much this country, good or bad has gi ven them, and t hat it saved 
m y life
. 
Q: What are your thoughts about ger -- 
G ermany
 today, do you feel very German? 
Do you sti ll feel German? 
A: Not at al l. I feel absolutely American. My l oyalties are totally t o this country. I 

never think about myself as a German, ever, ever. It™s interesting -- not because I 

deliberately did this, it was just a gradual progress. It was -- I never t hought of 

m yself any more as German, I alwa ys thought  of m yself as Jewish. And by Jewi sh I 
have tried to explain to m y children, who are not religious, but are a -- very Jewi sh, I 
alwa ys tell them that Jew -- being a Jew is not a religion. It is only partly that. Being 

Jewish is 
--
 is a state of mi nd. It is an -- 
a 
--
 
a 
--
 
a very 
-- it is a part  of you, it™s an 
attachment of you.It™s something youcannot
 erase, it is j ust a fact. I said, you are a 

Jew. It is genetic. It ™s almost like a genetic code, it is there. It is t he 5,000 years of 

history. And -- and I think myself as a -- an American and as a Jew. Probably first as 

a Jew, and then as an American.

 B, 
and 
you were tal king about your feelings of being a Jew.  
A: I think t hat™s one thi ng the Germans did for me is that they made me very 
conscious of Judaism and being a Jew. I think the fact that the y hated -- hated Jews 

so much, and were 
--
 I mean, the whole idea t hat the y were -- 
that they wantedonly 
one thing, which was to kill all of us, to eradicate us completely, I think reinforced, 

in me at least, and I think in most Holocaust survivors, especially those who really 

survived the Holocaust  in these -- i n the camps, that the y -- that --  that part of them 
re -- th -- I think the -- 
th
-the -- the main thrust  now is that the y are Jewish. That 
doesn™t mean that t he y necessarily practice it , but their awareness of it, o-of being a 

Jew. You s -- you asked me how I felt about 
Germany
 now, retrospectively? I 
feel 
that 
Germany
, tomorrow morning under 
Hitl er
, another 
Hitler
 coul d do the same 
thing. That has never changed in m y -- m y opi nion has never changed that. The -- as 

I said before, I don™t think they™re unique i n that. I think t he y have a 
parclivity
 -- 
proclivity t o do that, maybe a little faster, because once you™ve com mitted murder, 

the second t ime it makes it easier. I think t heir denials don™t in any way i mpress me.

I think they™re fully capable of relighting the ovens and doing it  all over again. I™m 
not being bitter, I™m si mply sa ying what I beli eve. Hopefully their governments will 

never permit  that, because I think ulti mately it is not the people who direct those 

activities, it  is the government that does it. And people, a 
--
 the people respond t o 
that, to the government™s edicts. 
G erma ny
 had behaved in an exemplary fashion in 
the last 20 years. Their government  has been democratic. The fr -- much more so 

than the French do -- as far as I™m concerned, the French were as rotten, in their own 

way, as the Germans were. I think ger -- 
France™s
 conduct  toward Jews during the 
second war is atroci ous. The fact that the y had a camp like -- 
camp like 
Gurs 
ri ght 
in the middle of their country wit hout protest, is outrageous. The fact that the y 

transported people
 by t he hundreds of thousands across t heir country to these horror 

is -- is -- is an indict ment against t hem. The y™ve never accepted their guilt. O
n ly 
lately I think I™m supposed to be getting 25,000 
francs
 from them for transporting 
m y parents to 
Auschwit
z
. So I mean, the whol e European 
--
 the -- 
all of 
Euro pe 
-- 
the ur -- Austrians, for example, w
e 
-- you know, we talk about t he Austrians and 

the 
anschl uss. 
The Austrians were no better than the Germans. I mean, all of 

Euro pe
 was corrupted 
by 
Hitler
, but basically underneath it all, it  could never have 
happened, 
Hitler
 could have never achieved what he did if underneat h it all wasn™t 
this enormous wave of anti-Semiti sm that  was allowed to spread and t o be acted on. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

That is the calamity of the -- of -- of the second World War and the Jews; it is the 
fact that the Austrians, the Germans, the French, all the rest were al lowed -- 
not only 

allowed but  encouraged, to act on festering anti-Semitism that had been there for a 

very, very l ong ti me. It  didn™t happen in 1933, it was there. It was simply allowed to 

come to the surface full force and to be acted on in any way anybody saw fit. 
There™s a lot  of anti-Semit ism in this country. It is suppressed, it is never allowed to 
be acted on. If it was suddenly all owed to be fr -- to -- to free flow, without any reins 

or checks, I don™t know what would happen here.  
Q: What do you think are the roots of that anti-Semitism? 

A: Well, C hristiani ty, of course. I think when you have -- 
when you ha 
-- are the 
child of a father, and I™m talking about now Judaism versus Chri stiani ty, and the 

father does not accept the child, in this case meaning Chri st, that is an enormous slap 
in the face. Christians simply cannot understand why Jews do not accept Christ as a 
godhead. That™s the number one cause. And for hundreds of years there was this 

m ythpromulgated that they 
-- that we killed, we the Jews killed this child, that™s 
number one, this chi -- this godhead. Number two, the Jews have always been in 

professions that have been 
very much 
-- not  necessarily in the professions, the y have 
beentheshopkeepers, where mone y hasal ways beenexchanged. They have been 
-- 
they were the ones who were sent out by the Poles and the Russi ans t o collect taxes. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002

The y became the hated people who collected t axes. The y had to collect them 
because their Christian bosses told them t o go out. I think they -- and the fact that 

Jews have had one philosophy, that is to educate, to educate and to educate. And 

they have al so done somet hing el se that we do, most societies don™t do and we don™t 

do any more either, which is sad, i s that they t ook the best and the bri ghtest and t he y 
married their best and their brightest off to their best and brightest girls, and the y 
gave them t he educat ion and those who were a little slower and not quite as bright 

were put in the corner and sa y oka y, be a good boy because your brother is the smart 

one, he™s got to learn. We did that, so we had -- we had genetically, probably, 

through hundreds of years had developed a group of people who were very bright, 

aggressive, and because of our -- because of our -- the nat ure of our 
--
 of our status 
in other countries, we™ve become aggressive. We have -- we -- we 
--
 we -- 
we feel 
that we have to act i n order to achieve. We have to push and shove in order to get 

anywhere, even when we don™t have to. And I think there is a lot  of resentment 

about that. It™s the same resentment that Americans begin to feel about Asians, 

because the y™re thrusti ng themsel ves into the forefront of education, of everything, 

and it™s beg -- 
an
-and it™s -- and now the rest of Americans are begi nning to resent 

them. You alwa ys resent that. Anti-Semit ism i s a very, very old and sad story. 

Q: Have -- have you been back to 
Germany
 at  all? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

A: No, I don™t want to go. Ai -- well, that™s not true, I™m starting t o think. 
Ellen
 
went to 
Speyer
 and she -- she went  to see for me, and she sent me back lots of 
things that  look familiar. So I™m t hinking ma ybe this year -- m- ma ybe not this year, 
but certainly by -- maybe by the end of the year, I™d like to go wi th m y son, he said 
he would go. Just to see where I lived, the house is still intact, everyt hing is intact, 
the synagogue is intact. 
Q: How many synagogues were there in 
Speyer
, just the one? 
A: One, yeah. Well, there may have been lit tle ones, but that was the big one, that 

was the mai n one. And would I go back? I think yes. My friend
 
Lenore
 went back 
to 
Berlin,
 they actually paid for her to come, and -- she sa ys otherwise she woul dn™t 

have gone. She says, I would have gone someplace else, but not t here. But look, life 

is -- life is -- is -- is -- i s a survival . When I live -- when I t alk to people -- when I™ve 
the -- the people that  I™ve met that have survived the Holocaust are di fferent from 
the ones who are -- who had -- who didn™t  have to deal wi th it. We are different. 

There are distinct differences. I don™t think -- I mean, I don™t think my friends or 

even my chi ldren know. The y think I™m just like everybody else. But underneath i t 

all, I think when you st art scratching the surface there are this -- there are this -- 

there are things that make us, that set us apart. I never want  that, you know, I thi nk 

I™ve s -- I think I strove very hard not to be a different -- I wanted to be a normal

teenager. I wanted to be a normal wife and mother. I made very sure I dressed t he 
same, I acted the same, I -- I was very much the young American wife, you know. I 

think it™s obvi -- very, very import ant to me that I should not be any different. I 

didn™t want  my chi ldren to feel that they had a mother who was, you know, a 

survivor. I mean the -- I-I never talked about it. I think -- and I alwa ys felt 
uncomfortable with the wa y people look at survivors. I mean, even I l ook at them -- 
I mean, it™s like I™m not one of them. Oh, I™m so sorry to hear that, where were you? 

Oh, in 
Gurs?
 Must have been terribl e, tell me all about it, you know? I mean, that™s 

what I™m saying, I never wanted to be like them. I neve
r wanted 
-- I mean, I couldn™t 
-- I -- if I™d had the number, I would have never shown anybody the number. It took 

me years to understand that it wasn™t my fault, I was not t o blame for this. I didn't 

have to assume the guilt for this. I felt guilty, so I didn™t want anybody t o know, or 
to remind me. I -- i n some wa y being different may -- I felt guilty because I was 
different. I felt guilty because it had happened to me and that -- I don™t know how to 

explain. It™s like a chil d that gets beaten by a parent and t he y assume the guilt for the 

parent like t he y had done somethi ng wro 
--
 well, I felt that ma ybe somet hing had -- 
we had done something. This is what I said about anti-Semitism. What did we do 

that we deserved thi s? We didn™t do anything. My parent s did nothing. 
Gunter™s
 
parents did nothing. I mean, m y friends -- they -- we -- there was not hing that a

Jew did that deserved t hem to end up as bones in a gas chamber. Not hing that t he y 
could have done deserved this. And I think that the smugness of even so
me 
American Jews when t hey say, well, you should have fought, you know, f-fight, 

fight what? It came l ike a bolt out  of the blue. These were people l ivi ng normal 

lives. My father di d not keep an 
Uzi
 under his bed. And he was a non-
violent man 
and he could never 
have de 
-- done anything. Yes, now, 50 years after the fact, you 

have an Israeli army, and you 
do have menlivin 
-- men and women i n this country 
who would not tolerate that being done to them. But that even -- 
but in m y 
community, where I live now, the y wouldn™t be prepared to fight an a -- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- 

a 
-- the onslaught of a Nazi™s raid. So, I mean, you know, it -- it™s -- but I always felt 
that I didn't want to be -- I alwa ys -- when I meet somebody who™s gone through the 

-- through t he whol e scenario, which I did not, went to 
Ausch
i-
schwitz
, survived 
Auschwitz, 
the fact that the y used to be able t o talk about it so willingly 

embarrassed me. 
That was m y own s -- reluct ance to deal with it, to be different. 
And I don™t know if any of the people that you interviewed have ever told you t hat 

they did not -- they didn™t want to be -- the y wanted to be like everybody else. The y 

wanted to be normal. Especially with their very young. A child doesn™t want to be -- 

I mean, m y friend 
Phyllis Coen
, who I™m been friends with for over sixt -- for 60 

years because I met her when I was 12, 
in elem
entary school, sh-sh 
--
 she said she 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
103
 
remembers me very well. I don™t. I don™t remember her because I think I blocked out 
that thing. I didn™t want to be the little girl  who sat in class, that everybody was 

talking about, who was -- had come over from 
Germany
, and her parents didn™t 
come with her and I thi nk her parents are in a concentration camp, and I think she 

was in a concentrati on camp. I didn't want that . I wanted to be like them. I envied 
them. I envi ed them being -- going -- I remember I used t o -- I alwa ys had friends. I 
remember being envious of going to m y girlfriend™s house after school and havi ng -- 

we used to have cookies or milk, or I had a friend who loved tomato soup. She 

would open up cans of tomato soup for me, surely, and I would sit there and have 

tomato soup. And her mother would come in and she™d bend down, she™d kiss her. 

And she al ways patted me on the head, she al ways liked me. And say, girls, what 

else do you want? But I envied her the normalcy. I never had that and I wanted my 
children to have that. You know, I want -- I used to play hopscotch with m y children 
when I -- because I want -- didn™t -- I want ed them to not feel that ali enation, and I 

alwa ys wanted to be the same, like a -- of course, I couldn™t be. I didn™t have the 

parents, you know, to make hi -- tomato soup. But -- and -- and agai n, it took me 

years to understand, that as sad as that was -- and it was sad, it was sad for a little 

girl not to have a mother and father. It was sad for me to have m y first period and 

not know what it was, t o see the -- you know, to see it and not underst and what was 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
104
 
happening t o me. I thought -- I was ashamed t hat I had done somethi ng wrong, 
because 
-- you know. Finally somebody explained it. But , on the other hand, years 

later when I used to list en to the stories of what went on in their li ves, that looked so 

glorious to me from the outside, al l the neuroti c parents and the thi ngs that were 

going on behind cl osed doors whi ch weren™t so wonderful, I didn™t know that at the 
time. I might not have been so longing for it if I had known that with that -- with 
everything t here comes a price. And you know, that being a -- a chi ld, you know, 

that m y 
-- some of m y friends had very tough lives of their own, with their parents. 
Q: Di-Did you come to any of these newer i nsights through counseling, or just on 

your own?  

A: No, on m y own. I -- it -- you know, th-through examine -- I guess examining 

m yself a little more and being a little more honest, I think we lied to ourselves so 
much, unconsciously. I mean, I -- I -- I -- you know, when people used to sa y to me 
-- I used to sa y to t hem, when people woul d push me a little bit and say to me, 

Margitta
, n -- 
a 
-- you know, you just have a trace of an accent, that™s the only way 

anybody would every know you weren't born i n this country, I was so proud of 

m yself, because I had achieved that look, you know, that American look that, you 

know, that -- that t ogether, put together look and that nobody ever suspected 

anyt hing. And that ™s one of the reasons I never wanted to talk about it, because once 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
105
 
I did talk about it, or mention anything like that, then I became different, and I di dn't 
want to be different. You know, I wanted to spring full grown from a nervous head, 

you know, as -- as this American young adult. Then, as ti me went on, when I began 

to realize m y anxiety about my children, when I began to underst  -- when -- as I 

said, when I start hacking awa y that piece of steel inside of me that I had closed in 
and started to -- opening up and beginning to realize what I had done, I had taken 15 
years of m y li -- whol 
--
 m y first 15 years of life and just shoved it in a corner and 
pretended it didn™t exist. Well, dammit, it did exist, and i t was hava 
--
 re -- in some 
ways going to wreak havoc on me somewhere down the road. We p 
--
 I mean, the -- 
the survivors who won™t deal with it ha -- I-I 
--
 I™m sure -- I-I mean, we™re old now, 
but through the years I™m sure a lot of them paid a very heavy price, because you 

cannot ignore what has happened to you. I cannot ignore m y terror when t
hose men 
came at that -- to m y door at five o™clock in the morning and told m y parents to pack 
up my clot hes. I cannot -- I can™t alter that, the terror, and the -- what I felt when I 

saw my father weeping. Weeping, sitting t here with a shoe in his hand, trying to put 

his shoe on and weeping because he knew at  that moment that his life and m y 

mother™s life and probabl y m y grandmother™s and his chil dren™s lives were over, 

done with, they were going to die. He knew it, because he had fought so hard to get 

us out and he wouldn™t have done t hat if he had thought we woul d live. I can never 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

forget my grandmother™s face. She had these magnificent big blue eyes, she was a 
beautiful woman. Like, she looked -- she didn't look like m y mother, but they were 

both beautif ul, really beautiful. Unusually prett y women. The wa y she looked when 

shelooked around, she said, 
wh-where™s the bed? And m y mother™s t ears when she 
realizedthat her mot her 
-- she thought her mother had had a stroke. 
I mean, 
-- and 
on this horrible train. A nd the men banging, the soldiers banging on t he window , 
sayi ng give us your jewelry or you™re going t o die. I mean, those things were real, 

and m y sticking them somewhere there wasn™t going to -- wasn™t going to help me 

or m y children. I finall y sat m y children down and said these are t he facts of life, 

this is what you need t o know, this is what reall y happened. I want you to 

understand it. I™m not saying -- telling you this cause I want -- expect you to feel 

sorryfor your mot her, because your motheri
s one of the lucky ones and I™ve had a 
good life. But I want you to understand what happened to your grandparents. And I 
did, I told them everything. And then when I got all this crap toget her for -- for the -- 

France, 
I -- I did, I got  hysterical. I was at 
Bonnie™s 
house in 
Florida
 and she was 
Xeroxing
 and she was looking at somethi ng and I looked at it and it was a transport 

list. And I did, I just lost it. I lost it at 
Vad Yashe -- Yad Vashem -- 

Q: 
Yad Vashem. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
107
 
A: Yeah, in -- in 
Israel
. But, for the most part it™s oka y. I™m fine with it now. But I 
had to deal with it and I think that  the Hol ocaust -- I -- I admire those people who 
survived. I admired what they achieved. I look at a man -- ooh -- I l ook at a man l ike
 

Wiesel
, who is, I t hink the classic exponent of what human beings can survive and 

make of themselves. And I listened to some of the -- and I™ve listened to others, and 
I think to myself, they™re so much braver than I was, because they faced it, and t he y 
dealt with it. I didn™t. I just pretended it never happened. I made up a fantasy about 

the whole t hing. You know, oka y I went to 
G urs
, it wasn™t really bad. I had to l eave 
m y parents, but it was all right. You know, I went si -- t o 
Marjelier
, that was okay, 
too. We were in 
Marseilles, 
we were afraid of being arrested. I had rheumatic fever, 

fine. I™ll survive that, too. I mean, those are things -- I went to a hospital, couldn't 

speak a word of English, the y were doing things to me I didn™t understand. I mean, 
those things are things you need to deal with. You can™t just blit hely say them and 
think the y™re going to go awa y, the y™re not. They have -- they affect you. And I 

think that™s what happened to me, I finall y through the years learned to deal wit h it. 

Pretty well. 

Q: Are there any sights toda y, or sounds, or smells that trigger memories? You -- 

you 
-- you gave one of when you t ook your child to nurser -- to kindergarten and 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
108
 
you had to say goodbye and you thought of your mother. Are there any other things 
that you see in the worl d around you, or hear, t hat also 
triggers memories?
 
A: Lots of things. Well, as I said, when I smell  
Gruyere
 cheese, it always reminds 

me of that trip. Dishwater. Dirty di shwater remi nds me of 
Gurs
 because the soup 
smelled strange, and I™d smelled a little bit like th -- like cabbage-
y.
 I think when I 
see pictures of -- of -- there was a fil m wit h -- which I never an -- I never watch 

anyt hing t hat has t o do with the concentrati on camps ever
, and
 I have not seen 

ﬁSchindler™s Li st,ﬂ 
I do not -- I have not been to the Hol ocaust Museum, I haven™t -

- the only place I ever went to was 
Yad Vashem
 and that was very hard for me. But 
I think it™s ti me for me to get over t hat a lit tle bit. There™s certain thin g, it -- like, I 

saw a movi e with 
Vanessa Redgrave
 where she was playi ng the viol in. Well, we 
had -- we had a young woman who had li ke a flute with her in 
G urs, 
and she would 
pla y occasionally. So when I hear those plaintive sounds, it reminds me. You n -- 

you never forget. Whenever I see pictures of 
France
, you know -- I don™t know 
where it was, I think couple years ago they were talking about the 
Pyrenees, 
and I 
-- 
I was right there. I mean, I saw it all ag -- all over again. 

Q: Have you been back to that part of
 France
? 
A: I™ve never been back to 
France. 
But I mean, those are thi
ngs that 
-- that remind 

me. When I see pict ures 
um 
-- 
the second Worldwar, 
when I see, for example, some

old movies that 
are mi 
-- that reminds me when I came over here and -- and gila --  
ﬁCasablancaﬂ
 for example, I st -- you know -- 
I mean
 there are a lo
t 
-- 
Lisbon
, 
when somebody talks about 
Lisbon, 
I™m back, you know, when 
--
 wit h the bread 
and baskets. Yes, I think there are al wa ys memories. There are always certain smells 

that suddenly you are transported back. I cannot look at a 
Bing
 cherry, t hat -- 
without thinking of when 
Hilda
, who was -- used to take care of us, my brother and 
I, during the summer, and she used to get the 
Bing 
cherri es with the -- the thing and 
make earrings for me. And I-I remember that all the time. I -- when I see old movies 

that have th -- 
I mean, 
ﬁTarzan
,ﬂ I loved that book, I read that in concentration 
camp. ﬁ
An Old Fashioned Girlﬂ
 
by 
Louisa May Alcott,
 I read t hat . Those are 
things I™ll always remember, you know, t hat I don™t know, it -- it  -- it -- it™s -- it™s 

unexpected, I
 mean, you don™t look for it, it™s -- just happens and -- and it™s there. I 
mean, you d
on™t look for those memories, they j ust happened. And I think scent is a 
very pow --  provocative kind of memory. The thing I -- 
m y mother™s birthda yand 
m y father™s, I always, you know, think about them. I someti mes can™t believe -- I 

still can™t believe that 
--
 that -- one of the -- I™m sure that you™ve heard this so many 
times, that I ha -- one of the things that I have never been able to grasp -- I 

understand it intellectuall y, but emotional ly, how an -- bo -- how c-could I ever be 

that angry, or that full of hate that I could t ake women and put t hem on a cattle car 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

and let those people walk into an oven to die? Into a chamber to di e? Could -- how 
could that have happened? I mean, t hat™s -- those are moot questions, they™ve been 

asked a mil lion ti mes. How did it  happen and why™d it happen. But I someti mes 

think to m yself, I was t here, I saw these people. I understand that after awhile t
h e y 

lose their humanity. You do -- no l onger look at them as human beings. They™ve lost 
it. I mean, t he y™ve become gray and dirty and with matter hair and they are no 
longer these attractive people that ma ybe you saw the first ti me. After awhile the y 

bec 
-- the y shuffle, they don™t walk any more, the y have become vacant looking, 

they have no expression in their eyes. But  even so, can you do that? Can you tel l 

somebody -- send somebody to their death? Those are the questions I™ve had about 

all this applica -- for th-these last 50 years. How can we -- how could that have 

happened? How could it have happened to somebody like m y mother, who was such 
an i mmacul ate woman, to end her life that way? You know? Who was brought up 
carefully by her own mother, and cherished? And yet, ended -- and had to die in that 

way, for what reason? An-And I -- I -- as I sai d, I became an agnostic when I was 

14, but not  because of that. I must tell you, I never decided there was no God 

because 
-- and I still have not decided that because nobody can prove one way or th
e 

other. The only reason -- it™s not because of my own rage, that had nothing to do 

with it. It just seemed scientifically and logicall y i mpossi ble to me. I mean, it™s like, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

what did I hear, y- yesterda y, somebody sa ying I can™t really believe that people 
around there flapping with their win -- wings, there are just too many of them. But, I 

mean, I became agnosti c because I -- I c -- I couldn™t accept the reali t y of a -- 
a 
-- an 
organized religion t hat, you know, of a God. I mean, I just -- not because how could 

he have done -- had that happen. That is the -- that is the cry of -- of -- of grief and 
mourning, how could you let that happen t o us, we are your chosen people. I always 
felt that we would have been a lot better off if He™d chosen the Chinese, but you 

know, but the thing is, that isn™t why I decided. And of course, underneath it all I™m 

just as much of a coward as anybody else and I™m hoping I™m wrong. 

Q: What about raisi ng your children religi ously? Did they have any religious 

education?  

A: Yes, my children are th -- bar -- bat -- 
mar 
-- bon
 -- 
the y were 
Bas Mitzvahed 
and 
Bar Mi tzvahed. 
And -- 

Q: Di-Di- Did your brother have a 
Bar Mitzvah
 when he was 13? 
A: Yes, he had a 
B ar Mitzvah
, a very nice one. And m y nieces, his two daught ers 
were raised and was -- both were 
Bar Mitzvah
 and m y nieces children were 
Bar 
Mitzvah 
and 
Bas Mitzvah
, yeah, I 
-- th-the tradition has continued. Not in the sense 
that m y father woul d have. 

Q: But -- but your chil dren had --

A: Oh --  
Q: -- Hebrew school training? 

A: Oh, absolutely, and again, the y chose -- if they ch -- they choose not to be 

religious, but the y™re very, very conscious, as I said earlier, of being Jewish and t he 

obligation that bei ng a Jew means. I mean, I t old them, I said, it is not the religion. I 
said, I don™t care if you do not go to shul , or to Temple, I said, but  I care very, very 
much if you ever lose your identity as a Jew. That is your first identity, a second 

identity is that you are an American Jew. And I think that ™s a big difference. You 

know, I a m a Jew. I may not be religious, but I am a Jew all the wa y, and nobody -- I 

mean, that would be the first thing I woul d ever tell anybody, I am a Jew, and I™m an 

American. So I thi nk there is, as I said, I think being Jewi sh is being li ke a 

statehood, you
 know, it ™s -- it™s -- it™s -- it™s a very special thing to me. And I thi nk 
that I got from m y father, because m y father was a very bright man and also a 
philosopher. I mean, he had a philosophy. He believed that -- he believed that -- that 

religion brings wit h it other things. Pride i n who you are, in your tradit ions, in the -- 

in your 
-- i n the knowl edge, in what the -- the contributi ons that your -- your people 
have made. I mean, if you really think about it, the Jews have contributed one-third 

of all th
e 
Nobel 
prizes winners in the worl d.

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memori al Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Margitta Cooper.
 This is tape number four, side
 
A, 
and you were talking about your father, and -- 

A: Well, m y father was an avid -- m y father was an avid reader, like I am. That™s 
one thing he and I shared. And the thing was t hat he also had enormous interest in 
people, and he was very well liked. There was a -- there was a man, I don™t know y -

- are you interested i n classical music? Okay, t here was a man that used to be on 

every Saturda y night, cannot think of his name, I have his letter home, who used to c 

-- do a program on classical music, what was his nam
e? 
Cliff
? Anyway, he was 
from 
Speyer
 and he was on 
PBS
 every Saturday for an hour or two hours and I 
wrote hi m a letter once and he wrote me a l etter back and he sa ys, your father 
trained mefor m y 
Bar Mitzvah
. I mean, this is a very famous man, he came fr
o m 
New York
, I think he™s dead now. Anywa y, he sa ys, your father was very nice, he 
said
,but your mot her was 
a lot prettier and I had a crush on her. But  m y father -- the 
only thing he -- m y fat her ever did for me -- t o me that I didn™t like i s he made me 

play the violin inst ead of the piano. But he always used to say t o me, what you have 

in your mi nd is gold, because nobody can take it from you. He said, and for every 

word you l earn, he sa ys, you will  get smarter, more intelli gent. And I said, what do 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

you 
mean? He said wel l, he says, if you learn a new word toda y, he said, that means 
you know that word and you will become more intelligent . He says, it™ll help you. 
And it took me years to understand that. Then of course, then I read 
John Milton
, 
and 
John Mil
ton
 had said the same thing, vocabulary is a 
power. So I 
-- I -- that 
--
 
you know, he was just -- I miss not have known -- I miss not having known him as 
an adult, because as a child you hold -- tal k to your parent in a different way than I 
would have, let™s say if he had -- if I had gotten to know hi m as an adult and he and I 

could have shared adul t thoughts. And that I never had the chance t o do. 

Q: Whatwas your brot her™s 
Bar Mitzvah
 like in 1942? 
A: Well, m y unclecame 
-- m y uncl es -- m y whole family -- I mean, the family came 
from 
Germany
 -- I mean, from 
New York, 
God. And hi s foster parents gave it to 
h im 
-- well, at that ti me we were sti ll with 
Snowhites, 
so sh -- the y gave it. And of 
course, it was really nice. We -- 
he was 
-- 
a 
Bar Mitzvah
 at an -- 
an Orthodox 
synagogue. There was a party for hi m. He was shorter than I was at that time, then 

he grew to be six feet t all. And he was very excited, he di d very well. And the thi ng 

I remember, he wore this navy blue suit, you know, how little boys dress for -- and 

he was reading the 
Haftorah 
and he really did very well, and I think 
--
 and I 
remember m y f -- 
m y 
--
 m- m y uncle looked at  me -- and I™m sure he wa -- 
I mean, 
we were all thinking about m y father, I mean, t hat he™s -- could not be there, 
I mean, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
115
 
he would have trained his own son, you know, for the 
Bar Mitzvah
 hi mself -- that 
he couldn™t be there. B ut I have to tell you, my Uncle
 
Hei nz
 came to m y son™s 
Bar 
Mitzvah
, t oo. And when m y son stood up to go -- you know, to -- to -- and I -- 
th ey 
called
 his father and I up to the 
Bima.
 And I remember, of course, I remember what 
I wore. I wore a suit about the color of
 Jacqueline Kennedy™s, 
which she wore to 
Texas,
 that color pink, and I wore a big hat. I really looked great that day. And I 

looked very young. I mean, you know, everybody thought I looked li ke I was 20. 

And we -- I stood up there with him, and when I looked down the tears were rolli ng 

down m y uncle™s face. And I said to him afterwards, I sai d
, 
Uncle
 Heinz
, I said, 
why were you crying? He sa ys, I t hought of how you -- your father would have 

loved the wa y your son looked, you have a beautiful son, and how you looked. I 

said, I know. Well, I remember my 
Tante Betty
, she was a cousi n of m y mother™s, 
we were wal king down the aisle when I was getting marri ed to -- to 
Walter. 
I wore 
pale blue sl ipper sat in, it was a beautiful gown, and m y Uncle
 
Hei nz
 paid for all that 
too. He was, as I said, rich. Anywa y, I didn™t know how rich he was t hen. I wish I 

had. Anywa y -- anyway, I™m walking down the aisle and of 
course everybody 
-- 
I 
don™t have t o tell you, I™m walking down the aisle with m y uncle, and of course 

everybody in -- it was down at the 
Luxemburger 
Temple in -- in 
New York, 
and 
everybody kne
w, oh poor 
Margaret, 
poor li ttl e orphan, poor little thi ng, you know, 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
116
 
and I knew it and I held my head up very high. And m y Aunt
 
Margaret
 had given 
everybody orders to control themselves, you know. Except my 
Tante Betty
. As I am 
walking down the aisle I hear this shriek. 
[indecipherabl e]
 
Ithought to myself, 
stupid wo man. And -- you know, she was always very melodramatic. I lost two 
crowns and I feel very self-conscious -- at 
--
 and I didn™t lose them, t hank God, I 
mean the two -- four crowns, actually, the whole thing came out yest erda y. Four 

thousand dollars if I™d lost them. Anyway, yeah, she as shrieking at the wedding, 

and m y 
--
 Walter 
t urned around to me afterwards -- and I remember t hinking my 
knees were shaking so much, I was so nervous, you know, and I remember 
Walter
 

didn™t want  to laugh, because he heard it, this 
Margitt. 
Anywa y, so I -- aft -- so I -- 
that part, you know, I™m 
--
 it™s sad that my fat her never had a chance to see his 
grandchildren or even his son, or m y mother. Now, when I was l ittle, I went upstairs 
once to the attic. We had a huge house, it was t hree stories. There, 
Gail, 
believe it  or 
not, was a chest, a hope chest that was yay hi gh, ma ybe t wo and a half feet high and 
ma ybe 70 i nches across. In that hope chest were sheets, beautiful, lace embroidered 

sheets with my initial on it and a space for where m y husband™s woul d go. Towels. 

Everything ever was so gorgeous I couldn™t wait to get married. I never wanted to be 

married, but I thought t his it beautif -- and now I -- you know, I used to think -- that 

was another thing t hat used to piss me, excuse me. Who got my sheet s? Who was 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

using 
M.G.
 with a little space for the husband? All these things. My mother™s 
sterling sil ver. All her bu -- beautiful things gone. You know, these were material  

things, I mean, they don™t make up for a life. But when you -- but it 
--
 she had to 
think about that. I mean, I -- I would be thinki ng -- h-how -- what  did she think 

about in the concentration camp? What did she think when she went -- got to 
Auschwitz? 
What were i -- ow -- I mean, if there is an afterlife. Those are the 
questions I have. What did the y feel like? What did the y think once my brother and I 

were gone? What did t hey think when the y saw us on that train going to -- you 

know, these little children, all these little children hanging out of the train, you 

know, and looking bewildered. And so many of them were -- you know. How di d 

that mother feel who let her little seven year ol d go -- six or seven year old child go, 

you know, and she was alone. She was alone, she had no husband. B ut I would -- I -- 
I thought about that. I t hink about it, what  if my father™s -- if he was dying -- if he 
had died of a heart attack and didn™t know, that™s one thi ng. But  suppose he wa -- 

had been dying -- suppose he died -- suppose these people died, the y knew the y 

were dying, the men, or the women, and they were leaving their mate behind to face 

something dreadful alone. At least if they had each other, there was some support. 

You were not alone in your fear, but if you had -- if you were a husband and you 

were dying and you were leaving your wife al one to face whatever there was coming 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
118
 
-- and I think by now they knew about 
Auschwitz
. They had to know, the y had to 
know that the camp was being emptied out. Where were all these people going? 

The y were not going home. So the y knew they were going someplace terrible. 

Q: Do you and your brother talk about what you went through now? Or did you as 

you were young adults and more mature adults? Did you t alk about it and do you 
still talk about it? 
A: My brother -- I approached my brother several ti mes and my brother™s word to 

me always was, I don™t remember. There are a few things that he remembers. He 

remembers
 Marseill es. 
I think he does not remember
 
Marjelier
. He remembers 
very little of 
Gurs
, but he remembers. But he remembers very little -- if I remem -- 

mention people to him,  he doesn™t remember t hem. I knew he did not  remember 
Gunter Katz
 at all. He didn™t remember 
Truda
. He --  
Q: Do-Does he talk about your parents?  

A: Very little. He remembers very little. He said my mother -- he -- the thing he said 

to my sister-in-
lawabout m y mot her
 is that he sa ys she was bossy. Which was true. 

My mother was firm. I mean, she had -- it was her wa y or no way. But he was a very 

fragile child. I mean, even before that, I thi nk he was a very sensit ive little boy, and 

I think he probably suffered in -- more than I did. Certainly he had more -- it had 

more of -- of -- 
a 
-- 
me 
-- well, he™s not int ro -- inpu -- he 
--
 it would not be -- he™s 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
119
 
not introspective. He does not look into t hings. I think he -- he keeps them covered 
up. I think he -- 
it was 
--
 it had -- the whole thing was very painful for hi m and I 
think he does not want to talk about it at al l.  

Q: When you talk t o hi m, do you talk in German, or in English?  

A: Only English. He doesn™t remember one word of German. Not  a word. Nothing. 
That™s what I meant  when I said he just wiped the slate clean, but  I mean clean. He -
- I said to hi m something once about
 
Gurs
 and he sa ys, I don™t remember. And I 
said something about coming over here in the 
Safir
 
Pi
nto
, he sa ys, I remember 
being really seasick. I said, you were terribly sea -- he was very seasi ck. But that™s 

it. He remembers being with his foster parents very well. From that moment on, he 

remembers everything. I mean, he 
remembers everything whenhe 
came to this 

country. Once he was here, his memory is perfect. It was j ust those ti me before that, 
he just doesn™t remember. 
Q: Did you fee -- keep up any connection with your first foster parent s? 

A: The y™re all dead, long -- 
oh, you mean 
-- 

Q: Well,I me
ant before the y died. 

A: No. No, no, no, I thi nk the y went back to 
Philadelphia
, which is where I think 

they wanted to be. Oh 
--
 oh -- oh no, the y got divorced. The 
Snowhites? 
Q: No, the first -- t he first po -- 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper

120
 
A: The
 Snowhites. 
Q: Those were your first po -- 

A: Those --  the 
Manikens
 
were m y second.The 
Snowhites 
got divorced, which 
--
 
and she remarried. She was really a nice -- she would have been a much nicer lady if 

she hadn™t been so harassed with t wo little -- I mean, with one four year old, then 
two more children coming in what  is really now -- was not that bi g a house. And the 
respon -- and frankly, I wasn't very -- I™m sure I wasn™t very cooperative either, 

because I wasn™t feel -- and I didn™t like her. And I was very puzzled by the whole 

thing. It was not what I expected, you know. I think I had -- I™d seen 
Shirley 
Temple
 
in ﬁ
Poor Little Rich Girl.
ﬂ I expected to move into thi s little mansion, you 

know, and have a ni ce l ittle butler named
 
Arthur Treacher
 taking care of me. I 
never expected to, you know. So -- oh, I had il lusions of grandeur too, and I was 
very i mmat ure in that sense, too. I mean, I wasn't -- I was 12, but I don™t think t hat I 
was really a true 12. I 
--
 like a -- I was still  young, like a child 
in many 
wa ys.  
Q: But you se -- you had alluded t o the first -- your first foster father, but there was 
no physical abuse or anything. Or was there? 

A: No, sexual abuse. 

Q: Sexual abuse. 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
121
 
A: Yeah, there was. There really was, and that ™s something my children did not 
know. I think I tol d 
Bonnie
 once a long, l ong time ago that somet i mes things hap -- 
but I mean, it was l i mited, let™s put it that wa y. I mean, you know, but he certainly 

tried. And except I was so frightened, I didn™t know, you know? And when I told 

Walter
 when we were married, he was going t o go find hi m and kill him. And you 
know, I sai d, that™s not an answer. He sa ys, how could he, you were 12 years old. I 
was, I was 12 years old, but I was, you know, starting to develop and -- and it wa -- 

it -- it happened when I came back from the convalescent home, so I was already 

almost 13. Because I went to the convalescent home in 1942, and si -- and I was 

going to be 13 in June. So, it happened around that ti me, and it didn™t happen, you 

know, very often. But I just knew he fondled me and I di dn™t underst and that. 

Q: Did -- did you report it to anybody? 
A: No.  
Q: Did you sa y anything? 

A: I never t old Mrs. 
Beser
, whom I saw once a month. I never told a soul. And I did 

not tell a soul for years and I™m telling you for the first ti me, except  may
be my 
daughter. I just never talked about it. It -- now, you know, now of course it™s 

wonderful cause girl s can talk, but  in those days, who would have believed me? This 

was a very respectable man. The y would have thought I was making i t up. Nobody 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
122
 
would have believed me and for years I wouldn™t sa y anyt hing, I wouldn™t have said 
anyt hing. Because of 
-- the chances are that somebody would have thought it was -- 
I was lying and I was -- I was afraid. And as I said, he never really harmed me. L -- 

it -- when 
I told 
Walter,
 he believed me. I mean,
 Walter 
knew that I would never, 
never lie about somethi ng and I -- just there was no reason for me to. Look, I had a t 
-- I had a doctor once, and -- who became very famous, his name was 
Edgar 
Berman. 
He wa -- 
became 
a famous surgeon, he took m y tonsil s out when I was 16 
years old, and he was doing somet hing with my -- 
on m y boob,I thoughtitwas part 
of the exam. It wasn™t until I was married that  I understood that this is not part of an 

exam. But he was doing it, ta
lkingto me the wholetime,neverpaid any attention, 

you know? And so I mean, wi -- girls, you know, I -- 
we don™t 
-- that -- that didn™t 
upset me at all because I thought i t was -- I had been examined so much in my life 
and I had so much blood taken and 
so many 
EKGs
 taken and so much stuff, that I 
just thought it was something new for the t onsillectom y, that it was part of that. And 
it took me, when I was married, about three fo -- I never tol d
 Walter
 about that one. 

I told hi m enough abou -- but I, you know, I think most young women have an 

unfortunate experience somewhere along in their lives before the y are married, that 

somebody tries something. So it is nothi ng unusual, nothing exceptional happened to 

me. It was not a rape, it was nothi ng brutal like that. It was just a guy who was, I 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
123
 
think ma ybe not -- I wouldn™t call  -- certainly would not  have cal led him a 
pedophile. I just think he was -- I was a young woman growing into mat urity and 

that wa -- and I was in his house, probably, you know, running around in -- in a slip 

without thinking. I don™t know. Again, we tend to blame ourselves, t here™s no 

excuse for his behavior. But that™s what happened. 
Q: Do you get reparations?  
A: No. I never knew I could. No, because first of all, I didn™t have loss of -- I didn™t 

have loss of work. The Germans -- the French are now payi ng for the loss of m y par 

-- mother going to 
Auschwitz
, they™re will ing to do that. As I sai d, they™re giving 
80,000
 
francs
, which I haven™t gott en yet. My brother did, but I haven™t yet. 
Q
: What 
-- what about your father, the loss of your father, the y don™t -- 
A: No. No, no, no, no, why woul d the y do that ? They pa y for nothing. There are no 
reparations from 
Germany
. 
Germany
 only di d it for property, and I got something 
for my house years an
d yearsago. Probably I mi shandled that 
-- m y brother and I 
did. But, you know, the thing is, t he y -- the y di d pa y reparat ions, are you ready for 
this, to 
Israel
 -- to these -- to 
Israel, 
is the y sent 
Mercedes
-
Benz
, mer 
-- that -- I 
could never understand that, why did the y do that? As -- as an atonement for what 

they did? 

Q: Do you feel totally assi milated now? 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
124
 
A: In this country?  Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I have absolutel y nothing l eft 
that -- of -- to -- of 
Euro pe
 at all. I mean, as I said before, I™ve all -- I™ve -- I™ve 
considered m yself an American from the get-go. The thing I feel bad about are the 

fact that m y children have never had a family, that the y™ve never had grandparent s, 

you know.  
Q: Wh
-When they were younger and you hadn™t told them the whole story, what did 
you sa y to them when 
--
 about not having grandparents? How did you present it t o 
them, before you told them? 

A: I told them that their grandparents were dead on Daddy™s and Momm y™s side. 

Both of them died in ur -- both died in 
Europe
. And then as the y got older I told 
them that both their p 
--
 all four of their grandparents died in concentration camps -- 
Walter™s
 did, too. So, I said, this i s what happened, and then the y began to 
understand. I mean, you know, the y un -- 
m y children 
are unusual  in the sense the y 
had four grandparent s die in a concentration camp. 
Walter™s 
parents died too, and 
so did mine.  

Q: Have you been back to 
Europe 
at all? 

A: I™ve never gone back to 
Europe
. When I st ood dramati cally wi th arms stretched 
out like 
Rose
 in the 
Titanic
 saying, I™m leaving, remember this moment, 
I meant it. 

I was not going to come back. But I™m ready now. Again, you know, it ta -- it took 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
125
 
me 
-- I™m a l ittle slow. But I told the children t hat I™d be willing t o go back to 
Germany
 and see, and go back to 
France
, you know, and see somet hing. And I™d 
like them t o see th 
--
 first of all, from a 
thetic
 point of view, it™s the 
--
 it™s a beaut iful 
country and there™s no reason for them not to see it, you know. And t hank God they 
don™t have t hose memories. The y™re gonna l ook at it -- the y may look at it with 
some sorrow for me, but certainly from their point of view, it -- it -- wa -- wa -- 
there™s no --  
there™s not h 
-- no anguish there for them, you know? I mean, the y don™t 
know th -- they never knew their grandparents, so it™s fine. I want them t o see it. It™s 

-- yeah, go ahead. 

Q: What 
-- t his is some time ago, but what  were your thoughts during the 
Eichmann
 
trial?  

A: That the y couldn™t hang him hi gh enough. I mean, my feelings for mi st -- well , 
the thing t hat impressed me about
 Eichmann
 is number one, the wa y the y got hi m. 
And m y fervent regret t hat the y never got 
Mengele
. But I also felt that  he represents 
to me what I said again earlier, that 
Germany
, under the right kind of 
Fü
hrer
 could 
absolutely revert right back to 1932 without any question, because 
Eichmann
 was 

totally, totally unremorseful. He was -- did not  regret one thing that he did. The only 

thing he regretted is that he was caught. He had -- he -- he felt absolutely justified in 

what he did, which is t he -- the horror of the whole thing, is -- i s what I s -- wa -- 

 
Interview with Margitta Cooper  
 
January 4, 2002 
 
 
 
126
 
you know, how can you do this t o another human being, I asked? Well, 
Eichmann
 
thought that was absol utely justified. That  is what™s so terrifying. Not that these 

people did things that were aga -- went agai nst the grain. These people did thi ngs 

that they felt were for t he greater good of -- for all. This was for the greater good of 

Germany
. The y were doing by t he -- the -- the -- the -- the ends justified the means 
-- or the means justified the ends, whatever. The point was that t he y felt what they 

had done was the thing to do. And that™s what ™s frightening. When people do things 

that go agai nst them, somewhere t he y begi n to break down. Somewhere their 

conscience begins t o catch up with them, but not if you really believe you™re doing 

the right thing. Then you just go on. And 
Eichmann 
sat in that chair in frozen, like 

glacial cal m, because he was right and the y -- his -- th-the people, his accusers, were 

wrong. He was convinced of that. And he went  to his death believi ng it. So I am 
convinced that if tomorrow morni ng a new regime -- I mean, look what the Germans 
have continued doi ng to the Turks. I mean, whatever their doing to t heir -- to 

foreigners, it is there. That absolute belief that somewhere along t he way, the y have 

achieved some kind of superiority. And t hat everybody el se is really just a notch 

beneath them. 

Q: Will you 
-- 
do youbuy German products?

A: No. No, and m y daughter bought a 
Porsche
. It was a very dramatic day. She said, 
I saw this little car. And I said oh, is that darli ng, is that adorable. It was in 
Massachusetts.
 She™s a very successful woman. So she says hop in, I™ll give you a 

ride. So we drive gi la 
--
 
Gloucester
, which is a lovely fishing town in mas -- loved 
it. And it was a very teemi ng, raining da y and I™m -- I -- 
I mean,every timewe went 
by this, water woul d wash over the whole car, it was -- and I jump out and she says, 
you like it, Mother? I said, it -- I™m telling you 
Bonnie
, i t™s adorable. I said, what  

kind is it? She said, oh, she says, i t™s like a little sports coupe. And of course, you 

know your child, ri ght? I said, 
Bonnie
, what li ttle sports coupe? She said, Mother, 
she said, now don™t get excited. I said, I™m not  excited. She s
ays, you™re 
gonna be.  I 
said no I™m not, I said, tell me. She sa ys, it™s a 
Porsche
. I said, a 
Porsche? 
You 
bought a -- I said, I guess next you™ll be buying 
Braun
. She sa ys, 
Braun
, a 
coffeemaker? I said, oh, you already got one. It was a nice car. She sold it. No, I 

won™t buy it. I -- y- you know, which is really st -- you know, i-it -- 
a 
-- i-it -- o-
outside of -- inside of me goes this const ant battle. Am I being really rationable, and 

-- and -- and normal, and -- not -- or stupi d? I mean, what am I -- what -- what am I 

achiev
ing? 
Braun
 does not miss me. The 
Porsche 
company will producecars, 
BMW
 is booming and the
 Volkswagen
 is back in full swing. So what -- what does 

m y boycotting have to do with anything? Is it just a matter of principl e, or is it just --

am I being absolutely wrong in doing this? Those are the questions. I know people 
that -- that did not survive anything, who are American born, who will not buy a 

German product, because -- out of respect for those who went before. And the y 

won™t do it. And yet, I know that t here are 
s 
--  Holocaust survivors, who are wearing 

the German watches, buyi ng the German cameras, driving the German cars. They 
don™t think it™s anyt hing wro -- so, it™s fine, whatever you want to do, you know. I 
have never bou -- I™ve never had the need t o buy it, but I am goi ng to buy the 
Bra un 

toothpa -- brush, because you know, being what is known as common sense wise, 

it™s a very good toothbrush. 

Q: On that note, is there anything else you wa -- 

A: No, I think 
[inaudible]
 
Q: -- you want to add t o what you said today, any other thoughts?  
A: Well, the only other -- I don™t have anot her thought besides 
Braun
. The thing I 
think that I would like -- if anyone ever list ens to this ramble, the onl y thing I would 
like them t o n -- remember is that vig
ilance 
--
 and I™m sure the y™re going to hear this 
on every tape that is in -- in this museum, that vigilance is something that Jews and 

all people need. That  human beings need to take care of each other, respect each 

other. I™m not aski ng them to love each other, because that™s really hard to do, but at 

least have respect and trust. If we have a sense of trust of each other, even if -- when

there™s betrayal, and there is bound to be betrayal between peoples, but if there is 
sufficient trust left, we can survive. We can™t survive without it. And I think this is 

the most difficult lessons for man to learn and he hasn™t learned it yet , we haven™t 

learned it. We have not  learned it in this year of 2002, we are -- you know, the -- let 
me end up on a not e ma -- of a man much wiser than I will ever be. 
Thucydides 
wrote a book called ﬁ
The Pelo ponnesian 
Wars.ﬂ
 And the book was written, I 

would sa y, 1500 t o 2000
 B.C.
. And he opens t he book -- and I™m paraphrasing 

because I™m not as clever as 
Thucydides
. He said, we are once agai n engaged in a 
great war, because we have not learned from t he past. Thi s man wrot e this 4,000 

years ago. And we begin the year 2002, once again engaged in great wars all over 

this globe. We haven™t learned anything. And I think if m y experience and those 

who came before me and those who will  come after me, will teach anyone, it™s that 
we need to learn to t rust each other and to know somethi ng about just ice and 
decenc y toward each ot her. That™s all I can sa y. 

Q: Well that™s a lovely note to end on. Thank you very much for doing the 

interview.  

A: Thank you. Now, I™d like a --  

Q: This is a -- this concludes the

Holocaust Memorial Museum
