Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
David Weiss Halivni
, which is taped on Ju ne 13
th
, 2014. The interviewer is 
Michael Abramowitz
, and we are at the mu seum in 
Washington
, 
D
.
C
. So, 
professor, I would like to start with some 
basic questions: where were you born, and 
Œ and where were you raised? 
Answer: Well, I was b o rn in a little v
illage, which changed 
hands a number of 
times. It was called 
P o lia na  Ko by letska
. 
Poliana
, 
p-o-l-y-n
, 
ko ba
, 
k-o-b Œ koba
, 
b-e-l-e-c-k-y
, that™s how I spell it. At that
 time, when I was born, it was 
Czechoslovakia
. Then for a while 
after the war, it was 
Russia
. Now it™s 
Ukraine
. 
But my father got there becau se Œ which is interesting 
Œ all of a sudden Œ that™s 
what people told me, a wonder rabbi appeared. 
Q: A wonder rabbi? 
A: Yes. Supposedly he performed miracles
. He knew a person, th e ba Œ sickness, 
which is always the platform
 for wonder people, you know
, to heal, to Œ and my f Œ 
and he need ed somebody to set up his 
Œ his sel Œ activities, and my father was 
chosen, and therefore he move
d to Œ he Œ he settled in 
Poliana
, in 
Ponya
(ph), and 
he moved there. And of course, I was there,
 I was born there. I tell it because all of 
a sudden, two or three years later, he 
ceased performing miracles, and th e whole

thing evaporated, and there was no Œ ther
e was no reason for my  grandfather Œ for 
my father any more to stay there, and 
we moved away  from there, we moved to a 
bigger city called 
Houst
(ph) or 
Hist
(ph), 
Houst
(ph). May I also tell you, I think it™s 
interesting, you Œ you™ll de
cide what you want do with th
is story. After this he 
became paralyzed, and nobody 
even know where Œ what 
happened then. The whole 
thing, the whole Œ there were only 50 famili
es, Jewish families in Œ in that village, 
and if he left, th Œ 
Q: Was his whole body paralyzed? 
A: Whole bo-body, th Œ we
 need  Œ and people didn™t Œ 
didn™t hear from him, I 
didn™t know what happened. 
And then, a few month before 
deportation, in ™44, I got 
a message he appeared, reappeared. Must ha
ve been in an ins
titution the meantime, 
I don™t know. He reappeared, and asked to be
 Œ he wants to see me. I was come pa Œ 
I was 
[indecipherable]
 outside my  narrow Œ he mu st ha
ve heard, he wants to come. 
Q: So you were about 15 or 16. 
A: Fifteen or 16. 
Q: And you had not seen y
our father for many years. 

A: No, I Œ my father, we Œ 
we do Œ I™ll come to it. 
Q: Okay .

A: I Œ I just want that Œ you don™t have to
 mention, but it™s interesting. I Œ he came 
to see me, he want to  come and see me, in
 a wheelchair, of course. As soon as he 
opened th e door, he burst out into tears l
oudly, and he couldn™t speak. Tried to 
break into  Œ hold a conversation, to engage
 in something, and didn™t come out. So 
much so that said goodbye, and we left. 
Few month later, there were Œ we were Œ 
the deportation to 
Auschwitz
. I™m always asking my self, what was the Œ the Œ the 
cause for that Œ what shall I say? Thunde
r, kind of flood of tears that came out? 
Could it be that I reminded him of the ye
ars when he had powe
r, and that caused 
that? Or, he still had some power, and he 
knew about the deportation. He knew I 
had 
[indecipherable]
 time. In any case, a few month 
later Œ later, of course he was 
deported, and he was Œ so, let me  go b
ack. My father left, went back to 
Ho ust
(ph), 
and we lived in 
Ho u s t
(ph) two or three years, and th
en  my  mo ther and father broke 
up, and th e age four or five Œ I was born 
in ™27 Œ the age of four or five, we Œ 
Mother left Father, and we went to 
Sighet
, where my grandfather lived. It was in 
Sighet
 that I was brought up, an
d I lived there with grandf
ather. Finally they were 
divorced. Til 
Mengele 
separated grandfather from me, you know, the Œ 

Q: Tell me a little bit about your grandfather, 
because he really became the fath er in 
your life.

A: Right, he is the Œ the Œ I do say, I 
say it in the book. There are two people who 
had the in fluence. On e was the grandfat
her, who was a gr Œ great Talmud scholar, 
but old-fashioned, if I may use the word 
[indeciphera b le]
 the old-fashioned, but the 
Œ who Œ who Œ who 
taught themself 
[indecipherable]
 at night, he used to give a Œ a 

lesson 
[indecipherable]
 Talmud. And Œ and he brought me up, that™s the male 
figure that I know. He was very poor, he 
could hardly  support me and my  mom, my  
mo ther and another sister. But he was then 
a great influence, that he taught me how 
to learn on a simple, elem
entary level. And he was a shochet, he was a 
Belzer 
shochet, with uniform, with a 
ka po to
(ph), you know what™s a 
ka poto
(ph) and 
[indecipherable]
 so from secular know
ledge, or secular activity, he had no id ea, 
there was no Œ it™s no Œ he didn™t Œ you can™
t even see he rejected it because he had 
no dealings, or that. So I wa
s brought up, and of course, 
along these lines. And then 
people asked Œ ev en today asked me how 
Œ where it comes from. I can™t answer the 
question. Since I remember, ev
en when  I was five or six years, and lived under the 
influence of grandfather, I wanted to stu
dy secular knowledge. I wanted to have 
secular knowledge.  

Q: Did you go to Œ did you go to
 a secular sch ool at all?  
A: Not at all. 

Q: Not at all.

A: That™s what they Œ people asking me, 
where did that come. Maybe you will see 
what you could do with  that
. When I was a chi Œ five, si
x years even , and I used to 
pray, daven, and I said the prayer 
[indecipherable]
 God give us in our heart, 
understanding, to understand 
you and so on. I reme mb er I used to look at the 
window, signify ing outside knowledge as
 well, not only religious knowledge. 
Where I got that Œ that urge, I don™t kn
ow. That really, after the war, after the 
liberation, that was the reason I didn™t go to 
Isr a e l
. I wanted Œ was afraid I wouldn™t 
be able to study there, I didn™t know
, secular knowledge, so I went to the 
United 
States
 where the Œ so Œ so I had the Œ but 
then  I was Œ so grandfather had the 
enormous influence, other than some ideas.
 I was never a shochet, never believed in 
the 
[indecipherable]
, even though grandfather us
ed to tell miracles, and the 
[indecipherable]
. And then, of course, that lasted
 til Œ til ™44, and then ™44, the 
other person that had the influence on me, was Professor 
Saul Lieberman
, who 
was the great Œ the great Talmud scholars. 
And then eventually 
I adopted the more 
scientific, o r the more critic
al approach Œ co uld tell you I 
Œ to the study of Talmud, 
which I now write, teach, preach. 

Q: So you mentioned that yo
u were considered a child prodigy in  the Œ in the town 
where you grew up. Can you remember at a
ll how you Œ when you first realized  that 
might have a calling in this area?

A: Yes, I remember ex actly. 
When I felt that the first ti
me Œ when others felt that, 
how old was I? Was I seven? Around th ere, 
give or take. I used to go every Friday 
with grandfather to take a bath. We had 
no pi Œ we didn™t had hot water in the 
house, we had to warm it up 
[indecipherable]
. So once a week, Friday, as you 
could imagine, we went, and th ere was 
amba tya
(ph), a bath. We had to pay for it, 
and grand Œ but the Œ I was allowed for the 
two of us, he and me to use the same Œ 
the same bath. One day Œ one 
week  Œ one Friday Œ be th-t
here was a seat there, I 
remember, and there were two Œwhat™s the Eng
lish word for 
ambatya
(ph)? Wh at is 
it called, th e one that Œ it escapes me. The one that you have inside. 
Q: A bath . 
A: A bath, but what is it called,
 skatabietel
(ph) in Yiddish. 
Q: Not a sauna, or a steambath? 
A: No, no, no, no, th e container. 

Q: Oh, oh, a Œ a tub? 
A: A tu Œ that™s a tub, there™s a name, the tub, the ba-bathtub. 
Q: Bathtub, okay. 

A: Yeah, the bathtub is good enough. I reme
mber the bathtub in there was two, kind 
of place to sit, and I Œ we got up on the ba
thtub, and I tell grandfather, I rememb er, I 
could tell you th e name of all generation, 
the name of the generations, since the

time of 
Adam
, the first person, til King
 David
. 
[indecipherable] 
And I gave him 
the list, I still remember it. And that Œ 
Q: T-Tell me Œ right, that™s it. 
A: And so much so that afte
rwards, people in the street 
used to tell the story, and 
they used  to ask me, and 
[indecipherable]
 which is the Œ 
Q: So th ey would co me 
up to you and ask you ques
tions, try to test you. 
A: Yeah 
[indeciphera ble]
 wha-what Œ what™s th
e te Œ what™s the 21
st
 
[indecipherable]
. I have an interesting story I will tell though. I was Œ later on I 
learned Talmud, at the age of nine, 10, I knew 200 pages 
[indecipherable]
 by heart. 
And I came to a city, it™s called 
Vishiva
, my late wife came from th ere. And a man 
by th e name of 
Lefkowich
(ph), 
Bartka
(ph) 
Lefkowich
(ph) I think it was. 
Ya kabo wich
(ph). 
Yakabowich
(ph) to ld me, I™ll give you Œ tell me the 25
th 
rovo
(ph), the name of the sage who™s mentioned 
[indecipherable]
, and I™ll give 
you 25 
lei
. For a poor Œ for me, that was consider
able money. So  I told him. And I 
was stretching out my  hand to  get money. He turns to 
me, he says, how do I know 
that you are right? I remember it to this 
day, over here, I Œ I ha
ve Œ that was taken 
back, that he Œ he has such a 
[indecipherable]
 question. He Œ I Œ but I wanted the 
money, an d he was willing to give, so I to
ld him, if I™ll tell 
you th e 10, the 15, the 
20
th
 and the 25
th
, would you give me the money? No, don™t want.

Q: Can you Œ I don™t want to forg et your
 mother. Can you tell me a little bit about 
your mo ther, and Œ cause she alsoraised you, obvi
ously, and you Œ 
A: Lately Œ lately, I was thinking abou t that. Interesting. She was bitter. 
Q: Bitter. 
A: Bitter, yeah, because of the divorce, 
and sh e was an elegant woman, and Œ but 
life wasn™t elegant, life di
dn™t treat her too well. 
Q: And what was her name? 
A: 
Fayga
(ph). 
Q: 
Fayga
(ph). 
A: Our ten Œ two weeks ago, less than 
two weeks, it was 70 years that she and 
grandfather and my  sister and Au nt 
Ani
(ph) arrived at 
Auschwitz
. And really I was 
thinking, trying even to 
remember, I rememb ered th
at she would kiss me and 
passionately Œ I don™t remember. She was 
suffering. She had the daughter wh o was 
paralyzed. 

Q: Your sister? 
A: Pardon? 

Q: Your sister? 
A: My sister. 
Q: Yes.

A: 
Laysha
(ph) was her name. She died afterwar
ds a natural death, but that, of 
course, made life much more miserable. 
She was relatively intelligent, she had a 
Hungarian 
[indecipherable]
. She had ambition, she was a Œ which were never 
realized. So, she was religious
. So finally she was claime
d by the crematoria, w h en 
she came. That was 
[indecipherable]
. And then I was togeth
er with the aunt, she 
had a sister. The problem was that when 
we came to grandfather, we were four 
people; grandfather and the three children.
 I had a sister, and I™m one Œ the sick 
sister, and myself, and she and the mother, 
we were four people. Grandfather, with 
difficulty, could support us, which made Œ 
cal Œ created tension.
 We had really no 
full job. So  we ca Œ we Œ we Œ we 
came to gr-gr-grand-mother, she had to 
[indecipherable]
 in the Œ the Œ the kitchen, they
 have, of course, and the Œ th e 
household, and so on. But sh
e was always Œ always a sense of bitterness. But the 
problem was when we came the grandfather, 
in addition to the poverty, he had two 
still unmarried daughters. And in those tim
e, marriageable Œ to marriage, to get 
dowry, was not an easy Œ one
 easy thing. And the Œ and that, of course, added 

tension to th e house, which I 
[indecipherable]
 occasionally used to shout at me, 
then the other Œ I was convin
ced that they were against me. And th en finally one got 
married, and faced a tragedy; husband died 
within two or three years. But the other 
daughter came with me , though shu Œ she must have been  about in th e late 20s, you 

 
Interview with David Halivni  
 
June 13, 2014

could imagine those days, probably 
[indecipherable]
 to explain, you™ll understand. 
I thought she™s against me, and there is not
hing I could do. But I knew that if you 
mak e a 
Mi Shebeirach
, you know wh at a 
Mi Shebeirach
 is? When you read the 
Torah, if you want ask for 
health, or for anything, you 
read Œ you make Œ ask for a 
special blessing while the Torah,
 the scroll is on the table, 
that has special Œ so as a 
child, eight or nine, I thought that will 
work negatively too. If I™ll make a anti 
Mi 
Shebeirach
 against it, she will Œ something. 
Q: It™s like a curse or something. 
A: Something left. I didn™t rea
lize that when we arrived at 
Auschwitz
 70 years ago, 
and they  opened up th e cars, and they shouted 
[speaks German]
 I apparently  was 
near the door, and I jump ed out from am
ong the first one on the Œ I heard the 
shouting after me in Yiddish 
[speaks Yiddish]
. The Torah that you so mu ch 
work ed on Œ wo rked  on it Œ on there, 
should offend you Œ 
protect you. And I 
contribute Œ and it did protect. 
Q: That™s wonderful. So she Œ she Œ you 
Œ you realized that she Œ she loved you. 
A: She realized that time that she loved me
. In the Torah that 
you so  mu ch worked 
on Œ n-not so that I™d work
ed, that Œ that there™s Œ 
there™s so much willing to 
renounce, co nven iences 
[indecipherable]
 convenience in order to achieve it,

protect. She was Œ she didn™t go to  the crematoria, she went to a labor camp , and 
she died there. 

Q: Can you Œ I Œ I wonder if it™s possible if
 you could just take a Œ a couple minutes 
to tell us a little bit about what life was lik
e in the town where 
you grew up. Just Œ 
it™s a very Œ it™s interesting, because you™re
 a connection to a Œ to a Œ hundreds of 
years of history that have been lo st to 
many of us. But Œ and it was Œ and that was 
destroyed, you know, 
in the Holocaust. 
A: The Œ the city? The city Œ 
Q: What was life like ther
e, when  you grew up? 
A: The city was almo st 10,000 Jews, main
ly Hassidim. There were non-religious 
Jews too, but I didn™t know them, I found 
out after the war. Some of the youth were 
communists, like in other places. Religio
us. But I wa Œ I think I™m making a Œ a 
truthful statement; when I came to 
Sighet
 when  I was 40 years old, so that could be 
™31 Œ ™32. There may have 
been seven Œ several hundred
 young people with payos. 
When I left 
Sighet
 in ™44, there were less th
an 50. So this secularization 
[indecipherable]
 or the communization had enormous impact. The Jews were 
generally poor, all Hassidim of certai
n Rebbes, engaged in quarrel, in 
[indecipherable]
 as there is always between 
the Rebbes. And little Œ none Œ no 
connection with the non-Jews. I Œ we Œ th
e language we spoke, and didn™t even

know it, was Yiddish. I mean, I know Yiddis
h, how to go buy Œ buy in the Œ in th e 
shop. But I didn™t know 
[indecipherable]
 the Yiddish , I didn™t even know that there 
is some Germans in Yiddish , 
I eventually found 
out that the German™s in Yiddish . 
After the war I felt a kind of 
[indecipherable]
 a kind of poetic urge to write down, 
jot down , but I know no language, only Yiddi
sh. So I jotted down
 in Yiddish, and I 
was embarrassed to show. Bu t not long ago,
 I took it out, and they™re translatin g it 
to French. So I don™t know 
Yiddish, but not literally, I g u
ess. And although in my 
time there was already compuls Œ educatio
n was compulsory. But since I was born 
in the 
Czechoslovakian
 side, and I lived in 
Sighet
, 
Ro ma nia
, Mother denied me. 
Every year before scrips Œ school, the Œ 
an official came and asked, well is Œ are 
there children of school age, Mother could deny. 
Q: I see. This is a Romanian 
official, or Hungarian official? 
A: A Romanian official. 

Q: Romanian official, okay. 
A: But after the da Œ ma Œ the Hungarian 
came in, she couldn™t deny. She was afraid 
to deny me because that would be 
[indecipherable]
. So she burst out, she 
acknowledged, she confessed th
at she have. And then became 
[indecipherable]
 I 
was already almost 
[indecipherable]
. So with 
[indecipherable]
 with connections,

they let me do private Œ there were the four
 question Œ the four classes. So I think I 
did officially made the four classes. 
Q: How did Œ how did the Jews
 largely support themselves
 ak Œ you know, in Œ in 
Sighet
? 

A: Likely  to? 

Q: How did Œ how did Œ how did th e 
family, the Jewish families support 
themselves? 
A: Depend. There were a few stor Œ a few 
rich Jews. I don™t know, one of them was 
the richest, name was 
Mandolovich
(ph), he had a textile store. Not educated, but 
rich. But most of them were poor. Par 
Œ really poverty where e Œ bread was a 
looked after item, seek  Œ seek after item. 
Q: What did you typically ha
ve for dinner, for instance? 
A: Well, when things work ed, we did have
 ch icken Œ we did ha
ve meat, no, chicken 
was a Œ we used to buy Œ go to the Œ to
 the place where butc
her, where they sold 
meat, and buy a cheap meat, 
and we used to eat soup. 
That was the Œ practically 
every day. Shabbas, we needed mo re
, because they had a tradition Shabbas 
ma -
mahali
(ph), Shabbas foods, Sh abbas Œ and it was a problem that we had to 
[indecipherable]
 it up. But we ate enough, I nevertheless was not hungry , didn™t go 
around to wn . Bu t I couldn™t afford eat the kind of food I wanted.

Q: I wanted to ask you what Œ ab out one ot
her resident of the town. I think it™s fair 
to say you were probab ly the second
 most famous person to come from 
Sighet
, but 
I understand you were also friends with 
Elie Wiesel
. 
A: Yeah, we went to chayder together, ve
ry clo Œ he himself wrote somewhere that 
the closest people have is his wife and 
Halivni
. 
Q: Can you tell a Œ can you rememb er a little bit about what he was like when he 
was a boy? 
A: Sure, I could tell you about it. He was 
a kind of sickly child, didn™t always come 
to chayder. And he lo ok Œ sit near the window and looked up at the window 

[indecipherable]
. But he was bright, you could se
e he was bright. I sat near the 
Rebbe. He was a kind of 
[indecipherable]
 he sat a t the window. He did go to 
school, so he knew Ro manian. And from th
e Romanian, so close 
to French, that™s 
why after the war, he picked 
up French as his language. 
Q: We Œ he was not on the sa
me transport with you to 
Auschwitz
, was he? 
A: Th Œ not the sa Œ but the same  time. 

Q: S ame ti me.  

A: He Œ he Œ I wa Œ his father was a poli
ceman, he was no Œ in the ghetto, wasn™t 
always negative. And that™s why he was left
 to the last transport. I had nobody, I

was the first 
[indecipherable]
. We Œ I went Monday and he
 went thurs Œ Thursday, 
I think, or next Sunday. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let me ask you, in the town 
where you were raised, was their much 
knowledge of the events 
in the outside world? What was happening in Œ 
A: Very Œ very little. 

Q: Œ wh at was happening in 
Germany 
with the Nazis Œ 
A: Very Œ very little. We did know there 
were a few pe Œ one or two person who 
came back 
Brest-Litovsk
. The Hungarians, in ™43, or ™44, before the general 
deportation, deported some people who 
were Œ were not citizens of Œ and they 
brought them on the Po lish side, 
Brest-Litovsk
, where the Germans shot them and 
that. One ot Œ including my father, cameback. I don™t know, he smuggled th e way 

back. And they told of
 this. But that only Œ they wasn
™t supposed to speak about it, 
so only a few days ago la Œ only single ou
t individual, you know, and th at. But the 
idea was, I still remember it, tha-th
at that wouldn™t happen in Œ in 
Hungary

A: Obviously there were some clever pe

A: We Œ yes, we all do Œ in the mo rning,
 we had no radio, bu
t the neighbor had a 
radio, and came in

 and told us that the Ge

inconvenient. 
Q: Was it the German 
SS
, or was it the Hungarian police that Œ 
A: The Hungarian police. 
Q: So the Germans were not Œ 

A: You did hardly see a soul. 
Q: Hardly see them, mm. 
A: Yeah. And I was like Œ people thought 
the ghetto Œ we were only af Œ two or 
three weeks in the ghetto, four weeks. Four 
weeks. So I was not so Œ I didn™t have 
such a luxurious life, wasn™t 
so inconvenient. And as long as they let me do wa Œ do 
what I did before, I Œ it was only when  the 
Œ they took us away, led Œ took a Œ an-
and turn ed  us in the synagogue, 
Mozeikatorah

Again, the Hungarians took, 
and they put out to the tr

Auschwitz

Q: Sure. Did Œ let me ask you a couple 
other questions about the ghetto. Wa Œ it 
sounds as if it was Œ it was not like in 
Warsaw
, say, where they set up a Œ a fence, 
or anything, it was just Œ 
A: No, not in 
Warsaw
. At least my Œ I don™t know
 what people, even include 
maybe 
[indecipherable]
 father, who was an ins Œ who™
s an insider to the admin Œ 
leading, I will tell you. I had no connection. 
I was Œ I had two ro oms, then I had one 
room, I mean, and Œ 

Q: Did you live with another fami ly? 
A: Yes, I live with a Œ with a 
relative, another family. So I Œ 
Q: And you could co me and go, it sounds like.  
A: As long. Not well. I couldn™t come a
nd go, I couldn™t go leave the ghetto. Bu t I 
could go out to the street. 
Q: Ah, I see. 

A: But it was so crowded. We live Œ I™d shar
ed th-the same room, with the Œ I don™t 
remember now Œ no, I don™t th

Q: I see. 

A: Couldn™t move from there, and shouting. 

Q: Did th ey give you any fo od 
to eat, or water to drink? 
A: I don™t remember. There was something 
th ere, or we brought from we had Œ no, 
we didn™t need it. We had 
en ough food even  on th e train, the people. What did th ey 
do with the food th
ey left behind? I remember Œ what 
I think is that when we Œ told 
us to leave the ghetto, and we were Œ we 
were ord Œ form in a line, in Œ in the 
outside, befo re they took out to the shul
. And that time, then
 I remembered Œ I 
realized that this 
is seriousbusiness. 
Q: Did th ey tell you wh at they 
were going to do with you? 
A: No, no. 

Q: They didn™t Œ 

A: They didn™t tell them. We didn™t know
 even on the train where we are going. 
The only time we got Œ we knew we wer Œ 
we heard the story about work ing, we 
thought maybe the Germans will 
take us for work, and grandf
ather used to say to us

that, you will Œ I will help Œ you will work
 for me. I mean , I Œ the only time we Œ 
we Œ we got suspicious was on 
Kash u
(ph). There™s this big city 
Kash u
. And I 
didn™t know, but the people Œ 
when we moved in our direc
tion, with the train, the 
Kashu
 people 
[indecipherable]
 moving towards 
Poland
, not towards 
Germany
, 
and then we became scared.  
Q: All right, but at that time, do you have any sense of a Œ 

A: My father went to work
, but Œ but Œ but the Œ the tr
ains were horrible. I mean, 
you could imagine, was Œ th
ey were crowded, there we
re no facilities for the doing 
Œ and Œ and there was some kind of discip lines. But this Œ we had thought this until 

we go to work. Once you wo
r-wor Œ go to work, it diffi
cult. Every Œ every work 
what Œ but when  we moved to 
Poland
, to that direction, people were Œ who knew, 
realized that they take to 
Poland
, then became panic. 
Q: So there were people on the trai
n that knew about the gas chambers? 

A: No, no gas chambers, th
ey knew they lead to 
Poland
 and that Œ they Œ they  Œ 
they thought that we would have gone to 
Germany
, we probably  wo
uld work. If we 
went to

Q: They thought they

too much involved with
 these predictions.  
Q: Were you on the same Œ in the same ca
r with your family, with your grandfather 
and mother? 
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: So you Œ you were
 there with them? 
A: I™m telling you, til Œ til I jumped off th

Œ I mentioned that on 
the book, that I jumped
 off the car, and we 
[indecipherable]
 we were the ramp. 
You don™t know what 
[indecipherable]
. And passed by Mother, Mother reached 
me then, and she saw grandfather from a distance. So Mother says, don™t leave the 
maltan

. So I ran towards Œ I went 
towards him and I held onto his hand, and 
I was almost Œ soon after, I was stan ding

Q: How did you Œ how di
d you know th at it was

A: I didn™t know 
Mengele
, but it was an 
SS
, the discipline you couldn™t miss. And 
he had Œ he grabbed gr
andfather by the collar. 
And then there was the

[indeciphera ble]
 was a young man in the 30s, he probably would have 
send him on this side. But he to ld him some
thing, I couldn™t hear. I assume he may 
have seen all his important 
[indecipherable]
, including the president going in that 
side all together. So he pushed him in that 
side, and th at™s the Œ and then he turn s to 
me and says,

made out of wood, a kind 
of Œ he hit me with that. You know, what™s Œ 
Q: A stick? 
A: Well, let™s say Œ not a regular stick. 
Q: A whip? 

A: A whip Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ let™s say, a whip  out of wo od. And 
he hit me, and Œ and I went to the other 

side, and that Œ that was the end. 

Q: Did you see pictures of

 after the war and you realized that was the

d Œ in there. 
A: Ah, I was too Œ too Œ too Œ

 only a few days. I

was told afterwards, I had Œ couldn™t even 
verify that, that when a transport came Œ 
and we™re talking primarily 
Hungarian trans Œ wh en a transport came, the tho Œ to 
Auschwitz
 I™m talking, the author
ities contact places in 
Germany
, asking th em 
whether they need  Œ wh et
her they need wo rk ers. 
Q: I see. 
A: That I understood. But I didn™t know Œ 
I don™t know whether it™s true, I heard it 
afterwards, that if Œ it happe
ned a few times. No Œ there 
na Œ there was no place that 
were looking for workers. And since transp
orts with Hungarian Jews came one after 

another, they killed those transport. They  
don™t know what to do with them. I don™t 

whether that is true. So, not 
all transports went before 
Mengele
. 
Q: Did you have a si Œ did you have a 
chance before you left, you know, befo re 
your grandfather went to the 
right, and you to the left, di
d you have a chance on the

A: No, no, I couldn™t te Œ the only thing,
 he thought, as I told
 you, that we™d be

Otherwise we were s

 stench wh en people had no 
place where to go. There™s Œ 
Q: I know you were only in 
Auschwitz
 for a few days, but do you remember 
anything about the camp? 
A: Not much. I wasn™t Œ I wasn™t spr
ead out. Certainly I didn™t know the 
surroundings. I do know that we
 went out, there were some Œ we were discussing, 
wondering, pondering whether Œ whether we
 could eat treyf as Œ as if there is 
something to eat. 

Q: What did you decide, it was okay? 
A: I decided it™s okay, although there was 
one person who did said
 he will not eat, 
but didn™t surviv e, I don™t know wh at Œ that™s any co nnection.

before I Œ th e few years, not the two or th

A: Œ and a half. 
[indecipherable]
 Then, at the very end, 
when things became so 
bad, we decided that we ar
e going to learn the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 chapter 25, 
that deals with wo men who husbands were 
lost. They  idea was, you probably heard 
the Germans, and then so on
, we should know 
after that, wha-what to find out in 
case women will have problems, we shou
ld know the laws, and shall know Œ 
Q: So he wa Œ he had a foreboding
 of Œ of bad things to come Œ 
A: What? 
Q: He was Œ that was an omen in
 his mind of bad things to come. 
A: Yeah, was a forebo Œ no, but he did not

Q: Okay  
[break] 
the tape again. Ju st take a mo ment. 
A: Good juice. 

Q: So where were w
e? Can you Œ can you Œ 
A: So Œ s-so we were Œ he told 
us to prepare to Œ wh en  I was in 
Wolfsberg
 and ca Œ 
I saw Œ took upon my self, on mo stly two transports from 
Sighet
, to keep a Œ also a 
memo ry to who Œ who died, 
so that I could afterwards be a witness for the 
[indecipherable]
. But after the war it turned out 
that women fared worse, because 
with children, 
Mengele
 send them straight, he did not check wh ether they™re Œ 
whether they™re th-the Œ able 
to work or not. So I st Œ 
to this day know who was the 
first victim, but he never Œ a
nd he didn™t Œ he didn™t, of 
course, surviv e, and neither 
did his wife, survive. 

Q: What did you Œ what did you do in  the camp? 
A: Well, depends. That I Œ I think that th
ere was very, very crucial and lam Œ to the 
survival, how do you tell. I 
was interested purely in Œ in
 su rvival. So
 much so, I 
think I mentioned in  the book, in  the memo irs, but that™s worth me mentioning 

again. There was, in
 my neighborhood in 
Sighet
, there was another family, by the 
name of 
Dupe

when I Œ we came to
 Wolfsberg

and said, what will happen? 
Q: You said what will happen? 
A: No, he ask me, he was robust Œ  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and he was able to wo rk. And he some
times even got in some extra piece, for 
the extra Œ or bread, for the

Q: You do the minima l, to make sure you surv ive.

 looked, I looked Œ I Œ this Œ my shovel moved. He

we were already neighbors 
there, which is the other

was with him. Can never forget that. One da

Then the father told me Œ he was our

[indeciphera ble]
 those were his words. Youwill survive. Was the second

Ossie

 named him Œ what happene

mo rn ing ,  
Ossie

Q: Cause he had exerted himself so mu ch, that he was so weak? 
A: I think the exertion, without the nu Œ 
without comp ensa Œ without nu-nutrition, 
and other things, health th
ings. He didn™t make it. 
Q: What was the nature of the work, what
 was going on in  the camp? What was the 
Œ 

A: Oh, th e different camps had different 
the work, more different. I was working 
with the shovel. We dug. The

A: Œ it™s simple

. We went in then, the particular place and made a

Œ and took out th-the Œ the debris, whatever
 it is, so there was room. And Œ and th en 
we went further, and so. We weren™t a

when  we were sitting that do Œ that Sunday
, or that Œ we sort of Œ supposedly free 
Sunday, he was 
[indecipherable]
 and we talked, I remember
ed what we learned in 
si Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 of sha Œ Sh -Shabbat, because the people knew it from the 

book, from the prayer 
book and so on. And I was sort 
of a leader. He saw that, and 
sort of decided that he™ll ta
ke me in in his comp any. 
Ackerman
(ph), who was doing 
the Œ it was a very difficult comp any, and 
th erefore, while the others work ed 12 
hours and na Œ they worked only 10. And 
th e occasion, sometim
es they even got 
cigarettes from the comp any, from Œ so when
 I got cigarettes, I 
sold it for bread. So, 
the idea was why Œ why would they  take me
 to a company whic
h worked so ha Œ 
was more difficult than the others? Because
 those drillers, you know, that made the 
hole, had to be sharpened. And they  didn™t 
want that to be bring to a fire, to a 
schmidder
(ph) Œ to a smith. They wa Œ th ey didn
™t want to do it in the ca Œ in the Œ 
in the Œ in the tunnel itself, fire, so  it was outside. So somebody had to bring those 

dri-driller to the schmi Œ where they shar
pened, and bring it 
back, two or three

times, or more times d u ring a Œ a night, le
t™s say. So, if I Œ and usually chose the 
youngest Œ I was the youngest 
Œ to do that work. That me
an that was much easier, 
and I also Œ the person also got the bene
fits, because the company did not notice. 
So, he took me in Œ into that
 Œ in his comp any, and I had those privilege. So, during 
my Œ at night, when we work
ed at night, I used to do four or five times, going 
through from a Œ from the Œ the place of wo
rk, inside the hotel, pending Œ every day 
it got larger and larger, to the outside where they were 
sharpened, and bring it back, 
and so on. That™s why I sa
id before, I walked with 
[indeciphera b le]
. I had to be 
very careful, because when th
e other people took out the 
Œ the stones, the Œ the Œ the 
pla Œ the Œ where the dynamite explod
ed, they had then a ca Œ a little 
cheela
(ph) 
they called, a ca Œ a little 
[indecipherable]
 car Œ cars, so Œ and there was hardly any 
room for a car or for a human being, ha
d to Œ there were cases where people 
[indecipherable]
. So, on the way, there was, in 
a crossroad, there was a German, 
who was not a German, was a toad. 
That me ans Œ toad  mean one of 
Volksdeutsche
, 
with that Œ 
deutsche 
was really his mo ther tongue, you could s Œ you could 
recognize. If he was a 
Volksdeutsche 
from 
Poland
, he spo Œ if he spoke German, it 
was on the Polish accent.
 So we knew Œ 
Q: He was a Pole. 
A: What?

Q: He was Polish.

A: But was born in 
Poland
. 
Q: I see, okay. 
A: What? 
Volksdeutsche
 Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ it™s called. And I used to Œ because 
some night, I met him a few times. I had to 
lift up my 
mütze
, my  hat at that procedure. One 
night I walked, and that time I™m 
beginning to  Œ I even  discuss Œ I rememb er
 what I was thinking ab out. I described 
that too, some 
[indecipherable]
 interesting 
[indecipherable]
 Talmudic question. 
[indecipherable]
. And I saw them, they used to eat 
the in Œ in between, and in the 
night too, but I saw he had his Œ his 
food is on a ripped and a sh Œ page of 
Shulch an 
Aruch
,
 
I remember 
[in d ecipherable]
 Pesach 
[indecipherable]
 and the Œ the laws 
of Pesach, and I remembered even the Œ th
e particular law, whether you could do it 
through an agency, an
 agent and I Œ I Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 and I fell to his feet, and 
I asked him to give me the 
bletl
. It was Œ it was saturated 
from fat, but he took out 
the Œ the 
[indeciphera ble]
 whatever. 
[indecipherable]
 and then  he gave it to me, 
and I brought it to camp. But then, as I sa id, there was a danger that the Germans

were Œ you couldn™t carry a
nything, contraband. So a Jew by the name of fines Œ 
Finkelstein
, I think he was from 
Martasalka
(ph), that™s a particular community, he 
carried it on his Œ on his body. 
When we came back to camp 
first, we used to Œ if 
there™s a free Sunday, we could il Œ use 
it. But month later when we went to 
Eb-
Ebensee
, you know the eb Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And there it was a total different. There was a 
vernichtungslager
, extermin ation 
camp. And I saw him from a distance, a
nd I asked them, mo tioned them what™s 

happened , and they  knocked on the 
[indecipherable]
. And then I was told two or 
three hours later he collapsed, and 
he was taken to the camp Œ to the 
mislaifa
(ph), 
and he was burned to gether with the 
bletl
. 
Q: He was Œ he was in the crematorium? 

A: What? 

Q: I™m sorry, he was Œ I Œ I didn™t hear what you said, he Œ 
A: He was Œ I was told Œ  
Q: Yes? 

A: Œ he co llapsed, and then they  tooked him to the crema-crematorium.  
Q: To the crematorium. 
A: And they burned them.

A: With the

[indecipherable]
 tells you 
[indecipherable]
. That 
bletl
, 
the Torah, has value on
ly if there is a Mr. 
Finkelstein
. No Mr. 
Finkelstein
, no 
bletl
. 
Q: You know, one thing that was interesti
ng was that Œ that I Œ that I was curious 
about from your memo ir, is that a number of
 the Œ of the Œ of the kapos seemed to 
be interested in you, and Œ 
A: A member?  
Q: The Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the kapos. The Œ 

A: Kapos, yes. 
Q: Œ yes. The-They were Œ they 
seemed interested in you, and Œ 
A: That™s Œ I Œ I can™t explain that. And 
there is Œ just a minute Œ and there is a 
story, wh ich I don™t Œ I don™t mention it, 
I didn™t know, and I think I™m use this 
opportunity to mention. I Œ one 
day already in bo Œ in Œ still in 
Wolfsberg
, one day 
a rumo r had it tha-that they taking kid Œ ch ildren Œ kids my  age to peel potatoes. 

You don™t know what that meant. Firs
t it meant warm. Usually you™re in the 
kitchen, you peel potatoes
. Secondly you have what
 Œ you have food. It™s 
[indecipherable]
. You could throw it in the 
yidda
(ph), you could throw it in the 
ovens. So, it was one of the mo st desired 
jobs. So I smuggled  my  Œ not smuggled, I

joined them. I went and sat 
down where they were suppos
ed to meet. The assistant, 
the vice-director, a short fellow, he had 
[indecipherable]
. You could imagine, if he 
had Œ had that position in camp, he was not a Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 he was not Œ he 
was known a certain 
ruth Œ ruthle Œ 
Q: Ruthlessness. 
A: Œ ruth lessness. He took me out. I Œ 
the second time I went, I smuggled  them 
again. Because I ne Œ I d Œ I don™t Œ I didn™t
 think yi Œ I ever met him, I ever knew Œ 
I met him, of course, I saw 
him every day, but not the ki
nd Œ face to face kind of 
meeting. And he took me out a second time. 
So I saw it™s useless.
 Then it turned out 
that they were Œ they weren™t taken to peel
 potatoes, they were to be killed. Now, I 
didn™t write in the memo ir because I didn™t Œ and I don™t know today either, what Œ 

why. Why would th is man, who was basical
ly cruel and inconsid erate, why would 
he take out? Why did he even know me? Th
e only explanation I have is that the one 
who Œ th ey only took so mebody take care 
of their needs, household needs, other 
need, took care of his house, 
and cooked, and 
so on, was from 
Sighet
. And he thi Œ 
even I think even told
 me that, that he once pointed ou
t, pointed me out to him, told 
him I was 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: I™m sorry, this was a person who help
ed Œ who worked for 
him, and was also 
from 
Sighet
?

A: Who Œ who too Œ 
who th Œ this kapo had the 
hou Œ had the room, a house. 
Q: I see. 

A: So this fellow from 
Sighet 
took care of his needs. 
Q: I see. 

A: He told me, I think, I think, that he onc
e pointed out Œ told hi
m, point at me , that 
I™m

Q: I see. 

A: I know Œ probably, you know, that. 
Q: So, he saved you. 
A: He may have Œ could it be? I can™t believe
 it to this Œ could it be that this man, 
despite his 
[indecipherable]
 that the learning of Ta

staggering. 
Q: Did he tell you why 
he was taking you out? 
A: No. 
Q: He just said go. 
A: No, he doesn™t talk to me. He never said 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: He just said go away .

A: That Œ there was another one that I mentioned, by the name of 
Lefkovich
(ph), 
who told  me he was a Œ a kapo, was once a ghetto 
shochet
, they said, that used to 
ask me to quote him erotic sections from the Talmud. 
Q: Erotic? 
A: Erotic, I said erotic. 

Q: Yes, uh-huh. 

A: Erotic, yeah. And he gave a piece of 
bread, or something. That, I understand. 
Q: You were transferred to 
Ebensee
. 
A: 
Eben see
, yeah. 
Q: February 1945, and you s Œ and you write
 in the book, but y
ou don™t really talk 
mu ch about it, that it was a long trip. It took maybe Œ 

A: Yeah, a month. 

Q: Œ a mo nth or so. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you Œ did you walk? 
A: Oh no, no, no, we couldn™
t walk, it™s a different coun
 Œ we rode on a train. 
Q: On a train. But the train went slow? 
A: The train went slow, st
opped place, and one place 
[indecipherable]
 that we have 
to eat.  

 
Interview with David Halivni

Q: Did th ey give you food? 
A: Very little. You could see people before
 and after, you could notice that their 
body Œ 
Q: So you didn™t lose any Œ you di
dn™t Œ you didn™t eat on that train. 
A: Very little. Something we must have been 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t remem Œ 
four weeks. Cause we came from sla Œ to 
Silesia
 but just in a Œ in a freight car. And 
whenever there was a need
, we were sidetracked. 
Q: I see. 
A: But that was a extermination camp. 

Q: Yes. 
A: You could imagine I was in block 24, 
and people, he contin
ued coming, but the 
number of people were the same . That™s wh ere it happens 
[indecipherable]
 I 
imagine. 

Q: Did you Œ was there a selection that
 you were involved in at all at 
Ebensee
? 
A: They did not a selection, people died 
natural. A lot of that, you saw it on the 
people. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did you have 
to do any work there? 
A: On th e train? 

Q: No, no, no, when  
you got to the camp.

A: Oh, oh, very Œ oh-oh, oh
-oh. The Œ the work was mo
re difficult, other than Œ 
than there, other than in 
Wo lfsb erg
. And th en I had the problem Œ I think I say that 
the Œ I said Œ 
Hitler
 committed suicide May sixth Œ is it Œ am I right? 
Q: I think Œ I think that™s right. 
A: I think it™s around there. I Œ and 
May four, I was so desperate, I was 
[indecipherable]
 there, in 
Ebensee
, I had to work, I couldn™t play games, watching 
when he looks. There was a small compan
y, they were Œ on th e whole ca Œ the 
colony had only 20 or twe Œ or
 fo ur Œ or 25 people, so the kapo could see exactly 
what™s happening. And we had to work
, and dig things a
nd Œ and I think I 
mentioned, I was working at the cemen
t Œ mixing cement, which meant that I 
couldn™t stop for a minute, cause if I stop the whole work, there will be no cement 

[indecipherable]
. Besides, I mean, it™s a Œ it™s Œ the Œ this kapo was an Œ an an ti-
Semite of the highest order and ed ition. I don™t know wh at Œ was he an German? He 

may have been a German, because we usually carried something on the 
[indecipherable]
 line, the first letter of nationality. I carried a 
J
, 
Jude
. He claimed 
afterwards that he thought it™s 
Yugoslavia
. And he Œ an d he find out that I™m a Jew, 
he want to kill me. And he ha
nded over to a Œ to a kapo, the day after Œ the day, or 
maybe even  a day after, who are Œ I think 
was also a Y u goslav, who already know 
that 
Hitler
 committed suicide.

A: So he te Œ he Œ he turned

 give me 25 l-lashes. Which would 
have been Œ wh ich would 
Œ that would have been 
fatal. Thekapo says 
[indecipherable]
 
Hitler™s Œ 
says shout. We™re not doing Œ he didn™t do it. And I 
shout, and th at™s
 how I survived. 
Q: I see, so you prou Œ 
you pre Œ you

A: Œ lashes.

A: And that™s how I survived.

 explicitness. 
Q: Did th e Œ did you and th e other workers in the camp  have any sense that the war 
was coming to an end? What was 
going on outside? You had no idea. 
A: We just hoped that everything was come to an end, but Œ

A: Well, let me before tell you something fo
r I want to tell you, then  we conclude. 
The fact Œ I go back to Mr. 
Dob
, 
d-o - b
, that I™ll survive, that
 happened second time. 
The hundred Œ the first time happened in 
Ungvár
.
 Ungvár
 is a city Œ you ever 
heard of 
Ungvár
? 
Q: Mm-mm. 
A: Uza Œ 
Uzhhorod [indecipherable]
 big Jewish Œ at that time was a big Jewish 
city. That™s a good way of ending that. Th
e Œ I came there in ™42 Œ ™42? Forty-two, 
™42 Œ ™43 Œ ™42. Came 
there, and there was a Œ a Jew, whose name I 
[indecipherable]
 
Hershel
(ph) 
Friedman
(ph), tells me ya Œ he tested me, asked me 
questions, you know. Says, y
ou will survive the war, I quot
e. I wouldn™t. Here is a 
d™var
 Torah, which I want you to 
reme mb er. And he gave me the 
d™var
 Torah, 
which I still remember. And that™s
 the way Œ he didn™t survive. 
Q: What was the 
d™var
 Torah about, that he Œ that he gave you? 
A: Oh, I could tell Œ I Œ I describe it in the memoirs Œ
 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ in great detail. I mention it, but then 
I don™t mention that maybe this part. I felt 
oblig ated Œ I met his ga Œ his son 
in  camp , and I want to give the

the son didn™t survive. Afte

responsib ility to remember. If you want I could tell you the 
d™var
 Torah, but it™s in 
there. 
Q: Okay . Well, t-tell me about the Œ the lib
eration of Œ of wh at
 Œ what Œ what you 
remember. Was it Œ was it the British that Œ 
A: Well, I Œ let m Œ le-let me tell you 
that everybody asked, who liberated you? 
Q: Yes. 
A: They don™t ask the other cl Œ mo re cr-c
rucial Œ crucial questi
on, what did you do 
after that? The Americans were 
there, they gave us chocolate, they left next day. 
Q: And the guard s ran away? 

A: The guards had to go away, or someone
 would kill them, of course. The guards 
left even before the Americans came. They
 knew the Americans ar
e in the vicinity. 
So, we stayed there, and we had diarrhea, 
I had diarrhea very, very  severely. And Œ 
and there 
[indeciphera ble]
 we had Œ but we were on 
our own. We had no money, 
we had no documents. I have now, I just 
put that Œ framed it, the document from the 
UNRRA
, asking govern ments to let us across, 
to let u Œ let us through. And then I 
went home, the few da
ys, nobody there. 
Q: Tell me, did an Œ the na Œ no one came to

food or take care 
of anyone, they just Œ yo

A: Less than five. 
Q: Less than five. 
A: From 62 Œ four survived. Two are interma
rry, that is, are not his natural children.

A: I have no connection with th em, I don™

A: The same school as the Œ 
Q: No, no, no, no, she goes now Œ 
[break] 
Ready? All right. So  a-actually, I did 
want to ask you about what happened afte
r the Œ you left the camps. And, first of 
all, I Œ I know you talk about this a little b
it, but I would like to put it on the table. 
Why do you take the name 
Halivni
? 
A: Well, to Œ two reasons. One, I Œ I™m Œ th
e semi-objective reason, if you want to 
call that objective, and 
Weiss
 being Œ there was an 
SS
 commander of 
Treblinka
, by 
the name of 
Weiss
. And then I en countered a person Œ 
SS
 by the name of 
Weiss
. So 
I decided that™s a good reason fo
r Œ for dropping that name 
Weiss
. But Œ but I 
couldn™t do that because grandfather was 
very close to me. On the other hand, 
Weiss [indecipherable]
 father™s name was 
Weiderman
(ph). So 
We-Weiss
, I make 
him forget 
[indecipherable]
. So by using a biblical wo
rd, it™s not a name in the 
Bible. Yes, it is a name, sorry, it is a name. B u t 
Halivni [indecipherable]
 
Halivni
. 
So I used  to use it both names, in the book says both name. But now that I went to 
Israel
, in 
Israel
 I don™t use both names, only 
Halivni
. 
Q: You know, you™re reminding me some
thing I wanted to ask you about your 
father, because we talked about him at th
e beginning of the interview. I wa Œ I 
reme mb ered a story that I wonder if you ha
ve mo re details about, because I found it

so interesting, that when 
he was being transported to 
Auschwitz
, he managed to 
send you a letter.  
A: Yeah, he send out the second time. Fi
rst he was imported as a known citizen, and 
he came back the part. And then he was 
sending a letter. He™d apparently dropped 
the letter in  the train, I don™t Œ 

Q: This is on the second time 
he was going Œ on his way to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Yeah, on to 
Auschwit z
, yes, y es, he arrived in 
Auschwitz Œ  
Q: Yes 

A: Œ must have. And Œ and Œ 
and I still received a letter 
in  the ghetto, even before 
me. The story is that he died on the way, was in 
Wa rsa w
 ghetto, th ey were brought

Q: Why did you make the decision to come to 
America
? 
A: Because that™s what I said before, 
I wanted so much to study, circular 
knowledge, circular 
[indecipherable]
 and I was afraid not
 having any relative, 
anybody, that I wouldn™t 
be able to do it in 
Israel
. I didn™t know about the war, but 
I probably  would have gone out to be a soldier. In 
America
, the American Jews 
will be, I know from iga Œ I got money. I was

u this story. I Œ 
when  I was nine, 10 Œ nine, 
I knew  200 pages of Talmud

reme mb er a good part of it, that time

lei
. You 
know what the 
lei
 is th e Œ th-the wa Œ is th
e Œ is the currency of Œ of 
Ro ma nia
. 
Q: Ah. Okay . 

A: The money came from a fellow, 
Forrenstein
(ph) in 
Boston
, who was 
philanthropic. 
Q: 
Forrenstein
(ph).  
A: Ye-Yeah, 
Forrenstein
(ph). He gave the money, and I was delighted. I met a few 
Œ a few month ago 
[indecipherable]
. Somebody Œ a young man who came over to 
do Œ introduced himself Œ 

Q: In 
Israel
. To you. 
A: In 
Israel
. Introduced himself as 
Forrenstein
(ph) from 
Boston
. So I ask him, 
what 
Forrenstein
(ph)? He says, the one who gave 
you money. So  it Œ I thi Œ was

delighted that the family rememb ers Œ or

that he Œ that he gave me the money. 
Q: Was your Œ was your trip Œ was your passage to 
America

Jewish social service agency? 

A: I don™t know exactly what ha Œ what
 happened was, I went back  to the 
DP
 camp, 
and from there Œ 

Q: Where was the 
DP
 camp, in Œ 
A: In Œ the last 
DP
 camp was 
Prien

Prienzay

what city is it called? Come back 
to me. A German city. Hanno Œ not 
Hanover
, 
Bremerhaven

Bremerhaven
. There they se Œ they colle
cted the Œ the children that 
[indecipherable]
 the story. They collected the 
chi Œ the children that came to 
America
, that were coming to 
America
. The Œ that big advantage was that these 
children still needed a quota as far as I know
, but they  had prio rity. So Œ so went 

back. I went back to that Œ be
fore to that camp. I was in 
Windsheim
 in a camp, and 
then I went to Œ to the 
[indecipherable]
 and from there I went to 
America

paid for it? I don™t know
. I Œ not long ago, in 
Israel
, I tried to go to
 the Joint and fi 
Œ I assume was with the Joint. And Œ a

America

and na Œ na Œ I know you talk
 about it your book in great 
detail, we don™t need to go

A: I was in the yeshiva. 
Q: You were in the yeshiva. 

A: That is now the yeshiva,
 and going still, at the age of

A: Yes. It™s interesting, I must tell you. 
I don™t know whether y

I Œ when I lived in the dormito

I got some records. One of th

Two years ago, three years ago Œ it was three years ago, in

Q: Where did you meet your wife? 
A: Oh, th ought I mentioned that. She was the granddaughter of th e 
Vishivavov

who was well-known  Œ there™s a two vol
ume, three volume book now, about his

Œ 

Q: In 1938? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 
A: And then  he passed

A: And then I went further. 
Q: Over the years, were you able to lear
n the fate of other family members? Were 
you Œ were you able to learn the fa
te of your other family memb ers? 
A: I Œ to this day I don™t know. I don™t kn
ow my sister  Œ my si
ster. I heard from fro 
Œ from a chaplain who in 
America
 told me, and I assume Œ I have some documents 
with the li Œ camps they were
. They send me in with the Œ but my sister Œ the 
chaplain told me 
that he was in 
Bergen-Belsen
 after the war, and then there was a 
hospital with people there, and he met a 
woman who was alrea
dy dilu Œ diluted Œ 
not diluted. 

Q: Delusional? 

A: What? Not delusional
, but she was not well. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: And she told him that she had a brother who was a 
[indecipherable]
 and so on. 
And he thinks that fits me. If that is th
e case, then she died 
after the war, though. 
Mother died in

A: Gra Œ with grandfather. And Father di
ed, as I mentioned before, on the way to

. That™s what I heard from people. An
d the aunt, I have her Œ her name 
appears on a list of camp s, but it doesn ™t sa
y when  she died. Or does it? I have at 
home. 
Q: I have a couple more, sort of larger
 questions, which I ju
st will acknowledge. 
We™re going to only be able 
to skirt the surface, but I wo
uld like to Œ I™d like you to  
consider them. First of all, I™m wonderi
ng just about you be
ing very open today 
about your experiences during 
the Holo caust, but did you 
have trouble talking about 
that after th e war? 

A: I didn™t talk. I didn™t talk after the wa
r. I didn™t talk after the war. But neither Œ 
neither did I have people ask, I mean, I Œ I didn™t Œ it was no Œ ta
lking or not talking 
would not playing a role in my life. 
I didn™t talk cause I was busy with Œ 
Q: With Talmud. 

A: Œ other things. 
Q: Yes. 
A: But I do Œ people claim that my scholarsh
ip is that Œ somebody wrote an article Œ 
my scholarship is influenced by 
[indecipherable]
. That this Œ that I™m critical of Œ 
in learning, which means you cri Œ critical
 in learning means that you interpret 
differently than Œ 

 
Interview with David Halivni  
 
June 13, 2014 
 

 
 
57
Q: Yes. 
A: It comes from the connection that you 
have no trust in human beings, that you 
basically think human beings are corrupt. 
Q: Do you think that™s
 an accurate analysis? 
A: What could I know? In other words, yo
u Œ a person who™s more trustworthy, will 
not look for new interpretation. That™s Œ that™s that Œ 

Q: Yeah, that™s 
the theory. Yeah. 
A: I assume that the 
theory goes Œ a man who 
[indecipherable]
 new interpretation, 
who has 10 volumes almo st now, with diffe
rent interpretations. One who was not 
only is not the 
[indecipherable]
 only, but the particular case 
[indecipherable]
 that 
consideration ab out. So  Œ though Œ so that 
maybe I™m Œ if that is th e case, then it Œ 
then that should be more investigated, mo
re study with  the inner connection. Of 

course, whenever somebody 
comes up with a new idea, not that Œ th at something 
new happen ed, but a n Œ a new idea of
 the things that already happen ed. 
Q: Yes. 

A: There should be a reason why he™s dissati
sfied with the old. And therefore that 
may Œ that may fit. 
Q: When  did you change your Œ when  did 
you start talking, and why did you start 
talking about the Holocaust again? 

 
Interview with David Halivni  
 
June 13, 2014 
 

 
 
58
A: I don™t Œ I don™t think it is Œ it was a sort
 of a break. More that in the beginning I 
just Œ there was no ca Œ I was too busy with something else. 
[indecipherable] 
going 
to school, living alone, and so on. 
Q: Did your children have a lot of questio
ns for you when they
 were growing up? 
A: No, no, they were Œ si
nce my wife was al so Œ sh
e was a Holocaust scholar. 
Q: Right. 
A: She wrote Œ so it was a Œ in the house Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ so to sp eak all that time, was nothing
 that Œ not what happened to some people 
that they™re all of a sudden Œ practically a
ll of a sudden begin to talk, and then  talk 
aba Œ and th en some of them couldn™t stop talking. 

Q: Yes. 

A: No, there wasn™t this here, there was Œ 
gradually I had mo re 
an opportunity. So I 
didn™t Œ didn™t Œ the Œ the Œ I think, I™m not correct on a 
-- Fortunoff
(ph), you 
know, the Œ the Œ had Œ gave money for the co
llege people to talk, 
as that Œ they had 
then 
[indecipherable]
 and they  had the Œ made someth
ing, a party, or a Œ and they 
asked me to talk, so I ta Œ they didn™t ask me
 talk about my talki
ng, but to talk about 
th Œ the 
[indecipherable]
. So I realized that that time,
 more than be
fore, how much

that is a problem, that it needs to be 
encouraged. The Œ but personally, I always 
read, and I still avidly, 
wherever I could, read
 about the Holocaust. 
Q: I™m wondering if you could ex plain Œ 
this is something you™ve written about, I 
know, in great detail, b u t I™m wondering 
if you could ex plain for a more general 
audience, th at is going to be watching this
, answer this question. Ho w did th e Œ how 
did the Holo caust affect your Œ your faith 
in God, and your ow
n religious beliefs? 
A: Oh, well that Œ you 
assume it did affect. 
Q: If it didn™t, then that™s a Œ that™s an answer too. 
A: The Œ then Œ then that is 
[indecipherable]
 answer. I think I to
ld  yo u  th at w h en  I 
Œ I mentioned the book, 
when I came to the 
States
, I met the late 
Moshe 
Myzels
(ph). You remember that?  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: He was the Œ he was the editor of 
[indecipherable]
 Hebrew magazine. He asked 
me, are you religious now, you know? I will 
still repeat. I said yes, religious. Were 
you religious before the war? 
[indecipherable]
. Said yes. He says, I understand that 
people religious before, are religious afte
r. They™re religious before, religious aft Œ 
the people that don™t Œ that rema
in  the same way, they either no 
[indecipherable]
 
nothing happened? 
[indecipherable]
. No, of course it™s modified, but I never broke 
with the religion. Although 
my  religion is proba Œ I mean, it™s not the same way, I

would say, as
 Sighet
, I mean, even as grandfather. The learning is certainly not, and 
that™s so Œ but that could have a na Œ 
could have happened anyhow, even with out 
the Holocaust, just going to college, l
earning secular the boo Œ reading secular 
books and so  on. So  it™s not to Œ to the 
Holo caust particularly. The Œ I don™t ever, 
ever kind of angry Œ I not remember bein
g angry at somebody, at something for the 
Holocaust, even t
hough my Œ now I 
have this book on 
[indecipherable]
 Holocaust, 
and I mi Œ if I only finish. I may write more 
o n  that topic, I haven™t finished that. I 
was probably influenced a great deal, but
 that may even be subconscious, you 
know, the whole Œ  
Q: You know, I was really inte
rested in something that y
ou wrote in your book, that 
I wil Œ that I wanted to just ask you 
about, cause you wrote the book maybe 20 
years ago, and you wrote ab
out Œ you made a statement 
that the Holocaust should 
be treated as an event withou
t explanation. That Œ that 
you increase the suffering of 
the victims, and the su
rvivors by asking Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ how or why this event 
could have happen ed. And I™m 
wondering if Œ if that is 
a statement you still believe? 
A: Well, yes and no, as everything is a yes an d no answer. That was a Œ that™s in the 
memoirs. That was a sort of a protest agains
t those Œ and I am still
 firmly against it, 

 
Interview with David Halivni

61
who considered the Holocaust the result of si
n. That, I think is unforgiveable for the 
Œ the survivors, for the sufferer, and u Œ 
and unforg iveable for the truth, objective 
truth. If you say that it is sin, that mean
s it was coming to them. I often quote, and I 
th Œ the Œ the Œ the 
mishna
(ph), and 
[indecipherable]
 says that, if the court 
executed somebody, the family of the convic
t, family of the Œ should come to the 
court, to the judges, and say 
[speaks foreign lang uage]
. We have nothing against 
our hearts on you. In other word s, justice, 
it was coming. We almo st have to g-go Œ 
come 
Hitler 
and say we have nothing 
[indecipherable]
 it™s because of sin. So th at I 
reject, full-hearted. So although not as 
successful for a substitute, we don™t have 
something that I could substitute. So, the id
ea is, leave it. Leave it as it is. That™s 
why 
[indecipherable]
 without a reason. Because 
any reason will 
ultimately Œ 
whether, you know, the Rabbi of 
[indeciphera ble]
, who se Œ by th e way, I was 
close to him, I was close to him. The Rabbi 
[indecipherable]
 thought the Zionist is 
the sin. And some people are bor Œ rabbis in 
Israel 
thought the Œ the anti-Zionists. 
We mu st say, I do in sist that the Holo
caust is a metaphysical. Certainly it™s not 
because they were Œ some Jews w ere commu
nists, or some Jews w ere capitalists. 
Or the way they say Œ said that 
in the New Testament, th at when 
Jesus
 was 
crucified, the Œ th-the Jewish leaders had made that blood

 on

them and on their children, 2,000 years a
g o .  Bu t my  p rob lem at th e mo men t is t o  
make it metaphysical, in a way th at human beings are not the cause. 
Q: Yes. 
A: That I am working on. 
Q: Well, let Œ let me fo llow up in this way, you know, 
Elie Wiesel [b reak] 
Œ they 
just have a technical problem. 

A: Oh. 
Q: And they™re just Œ and they™re just fi
xing Œ they™re just fi
xing that, and then 
they™ll keep  going. We™re just about five
 minutes away. Are you ready? Oh , okay, 
I™m sorry. So, what I wanted 
to ask you is, do you think there™s anything Œ cause 
Wiesel
 has talked about Œ you know, one of th e reasons he wanted  this mu seum to 

be formed, was he wanted to, obviously ha
ve a permanent memorial to the victims, 
but also to remind people ab
out what can happen
 in the future. A
nd so my  question 
to you is, the Holocaust was a unique event 
in human history, bu
t do you think there 
is something to learn from that episode that
 might help  us prevent this kind of thing 
from happening in th
e future? Maybe not on the same
 level, but the same kind Œ 
genocides have existed Œ 
A: That was the topic that 
Yad Vashem
 asked me to talk about here a year ago, or 
two years ago. What™s the mo
st effective way of preserving th e Œ the Œ Ho locaust? 

 
Interview with David Halivni  
 
June 13, 2014 
 

 
 
63
I™m not Œ and I™m saying th is with great ca
ution sh ould be misunderstood, then. I™m 
not sure that Œ that we could be sure that 
there will be no other Holocaust, since, as I 
said before, I think it™s a metaphysical. Ha
s so mething to do with free will. Man is 
created in a manner at least that Œ that he
 could do Œ God woul
d not interfere Œ will 
punish him, but He will not interfere with 
this evildoing. So, to
 ask, which is the 
basic question fo r a religious person, why 
God did not intervene 
in our time, when 
intervened in Œ interv
ened in the time of 
Haman
. The idea that something moved in 
the cosmological sphere, that caw Œ that G
od did not intervene. He in tervened  at 
that time, did not intervene. So , we
 cannot be Œ I think sometimes even 
Netanyahu
 
or the others, it was naïve to
 think that an Israeli, th
e Israeli power, military, could 
preven t 
Hitler
. Whoever remens Œ  remembers th
e power of the German army Œ 
now we have this 
Norm andy
, just what is it, 70 years? 
Q: Yes. 

A: You Œ you really thinks that 
Israel
 could have preven ted the German army ? So 
we are Œ I don™t know, I am still w o rking fi
nd out what is sort of Œ but it is our 
relationship to God, Jews, as I still belie
ve was the chosen people, but they  are 
chosen because God gave the 
Torah. And giving the Torah 
is a sort of intervene Œ 
intervention in a u Œ in a pe
rson™s life. God intervened 
Œ asked Œ intervenes in our 
life by telling us what to do, 
wh at not to do. And therefor
e, He may intervene in our

favor. When we are not following
 this part, sort of the barg
ain, the other part is not 
Œ it™s quite complicated. It™s not that simple. 
Q: What role do you think the Holocaus
t should play in 
Jewish collective 
conscience? 

A: In the Jewish collective Œ 

Q: In the Jewish collective consciousness. 

A: Well, that we are a unique people. I know 
Rwanda
, I know th e other thing, but 
not at that size, and that 
[indecipherable]
. Our relationship to God, and th erefore 
our relationship to the world is o Œ the wa
y religion claimed all alo ng, although not 
Œ religion may claim your details 
[indecipherable]
 that we have a particular 
relationship, and we should find out, pa
rticularly what Œ the channel by which it 
moves. And that may be the only way we™
ll prevent. Look I am Œ I™m troubled and 
Œ and Œ an d Œ and puzzled. During the war, 
I™m tal Œ when I say war, I mean the 
second World War Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ of co urse. 
Sweden
, 
Denmark
 was good for the Jews. I give you no examples, 
you know, save Jews, and 
[indecipherable]
. Today, they not so good to  
Israel
, 
which is a 
[indeciphera ble]
. Wh at happened in those 70 y
ears, sort of, 60 sort of? 
Did they Œ if th Œ there is some basic bu
ilt-in relationship that we have, with the 

 
Interview with David Halivni  
 
June 13, 2014 
 

 
 
65
worl Œ with God, and with the world, a
nd so on. And that so
rt of moves around. 
And therefore I Œ I me ntioned that in the Œ 
in the article on the prayer in the camp, 
you know, that Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: The Jews prayer, the ba Œ God has the Œ 
intervene Œ intervened
 on behalf of th e 
Jews is almost done th Œ b
ecause of He™s giving th e Torah 
[speaks foreign 
la ng ua g e ]
 the two are connected. 
[indecipherable]
 the Œ involves responsibility as 
well as Œ as co Œ as singling out, and so
 on. No w, God will intervene on our behalf, 
apparently  if we have Œ we
 Œ we are in debt, a certai
n Œ and maintaining a certain 
[indecipherable]
 for certain relationship. That is 
a very delicate bala
nce. When that 
relationship is disturbed, God may not in
terven e. I don™t know, I don™t have the 
picture, I mean 
[indecipherable]
 clearly, but that™s the direction I™m thinking. I 
cannot accept sin as the cause. 

Q: Let me ask you one finalquestion if I ma y, wh ich is
; do you have any personal 
way  o f  co mmemo ratin g  th e Ho lo cau st, o r  o f  rememb erin g  you r fami ly  memb ers  

who died ? 

A: That™s an interesting question. It™s 
a difficult question. What do Œ you can ask 
me what do you do during th
e Holo caust day. Almo st feel Œ I mean thank Œ I mean 
obviously, thank for the survival. There is no Œ I mean, there must be a reason, there

66
is 
[indecipherable]
 a reason, but not a known  reason at all why I survived  and Œ 
and 
Dupe
(ph), who was stronger and fatter, the Œ Mo ther used to come home from 
Œ from their home, visiting them, always th
at argument, why are you so Œ why are 
you so pale? Why, why pale? I was sitting 
[indecipherable]
 in the closed doors, 
and he was doing sports, and why I surv
ived? So, does that entail a special 
oblig ation, a special tha Œ usua
lly that Œ that leads, or s
hould lead to mo re learning, 
but that™s individual, a
nd Œ and that™s usu Œ the 
[indecipherable] 
having 
accomplished something. To leave for poster
ity something in learning, that™s what, 
that others did not sa
y it, did not have it. 
Q: Do you have anything else you 
want to say, that I™ve missed? 
A: Well, I Œ I thought about
