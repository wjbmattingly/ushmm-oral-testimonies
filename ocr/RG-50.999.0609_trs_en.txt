W e have prepared a brief slide presenta

W ebegin with this portrait of  Michel Margosis. Michel's parents were Russian
-
born 
Jews. His f ather had been a policeman in Russia who was deported to Siberiafor being an 

outspoken Zionist. Af ter escaping
,  
Michel's par

T hisphotograph, taken in 1938, shows Michel's brother, hism other,his sister, and 
Michel to thefar right.
 
 
In Brussels, Michel's f ather ownedand editedtwo newspapers, one in French and 
one in Yiddish. In this background photo we see the Yiddishnewspaper andthef ront photo is 
Michel's father's press card.
 
 
In 1940, when the Germ ans invaded Belgium, Michel and hisfam ily f led to the South 
of  France where they ended up in Marseille.The arrow shows their routefrom Belgium to 

Southern Fr
ance.
 
 
Here we see 14
-
year
-
old Michel walking down  the street in Marseille.
 
 
T he Margosisf am ily hoped to get exit visas to sailf or the United States but no visas 
were granted. So, instead, they escaped over the Pyreneesm ountains intoSpain.T he yellow 

a
rrow on this map shows their escape route.
 
 
Arrangem ents were madefor Michel to com e to the UnitedStates eventually. This 
photographof  Michel shows him  saying goodbye to hisfather in Portugal before he leaves for 

the United States. 
 

 
And in 1943 he em i
grated with other childrento the U.S. on the Serpa Pinto, which 
is on thepostcard on the right. On the lef t we have anewspaperarticle showing children 

preparingf or their departure,and Michel is shown with the arrow.
 
 
Bef ore I invite Michel to the stage, letm etellyou a bitm ore abouthim . He served in 
the U.S. Arm y during the KoreanW ar. For 26 years he worked asaresearch scientist with the 

U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistrationand was an expert in the analysis of  antibiotics. For 25 

years he served as a Hum an Rights Comm issioner in Fairfax County, Virginia, andhis
 
congressm an declared Michel a C
hampion of  
Hum an Rights on theCongressional Record. He 
rem ains very acti ve and volunteers in anum ber of  places, including,of course, at them useum .
 
 
I ' d  li
ke to welcom e Michel to the stage.
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So, Michel, you were 11 when the Nazis overran Poland, whenEngland and 
France declared war on Germ any. Can you tell us a little bitabout your life inBrussels just 

bef ore then? I'm struck by how ordinary an experience you had inm
an
y wa ys .
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, I grew up like any other kids.I went to school, trying to get away 
with things once ina while, learning, which was not particularly grea t. I mean,I was nota great 

student. But
 
I enjoyed livin g there.
 
 
My parents didn't have m uch tim efor usbecausem y parents were learning anew 
language in a new country, making anew li vi ng when m y father managed to be able to get the 

newspaper. So we didn't havem uch parenting, so I was f ree to roam .
 
I hardly ever saw m y 
brother, hardly ever saw m y sister. M y brother was three years older. My sister was four years 

older. Sof reedom of  the streets.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Freedom of  the streets.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W e didn't have thePT A back then. Idon't remem berm y parents ever 
m eeting any of m y teachers. But school was all right.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So,during those years when the Nazis cam e topower and they began 
enacting their plansfor the Jews, your f atherbegan notic
i n g s om e  
signs andnot only not
i c in g  
them  but writing about them  inpartbecauseof  whathehad experienced himself. Can youtell 

us a little bitabout how he was connecting som edotsthatm aybe other people weren't seeing?
 

>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, hehad lived through the Russian revolution, interned in Siberia. So 
knew what that kind of life wouldbe. Hem anaged toescape andm ake his way.When Hitler 

 
3
 
cam e topower, hetook note of it andalertedhis colleaguesthrough his writing. Said Hitler 
was com ing to power. He readthe accounts
 
and knew what theprogram  was going to be.
 
 
So when Poland was invaded, he was stranded covering the convention. It took him  
af ew m onthsto getback. But then whenBelgium
 
--
 
when Brussels was bom bed and the war 
started there, we im mediately m ade plans t
o leave.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And you described tom e seeing some changes inyour parents, in sortof  
their behavior, that was apparent to you. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W e ll,  t h
ey were quite anxious. Because he
 
had lived through the Russian 
dictatorship. My father sort of expected what was com ing. So we imm ediately left as soon as 

we could.W e packedwhatever we could take with us, lef t everything behind.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And tell us about your experienceescapingf rom Brussels.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, we packedeverythi ng we could.W e walked tothe railroad station. It 
tookus afew hours toget into itbecause it was so crowded.W e wanted totake the next train, 

which we m issedbecause it was too crowded.W e wantedto go to the coast to takea ship to 

England. Tha
t ship was sunk. I'm  glad we m issed it.I wouldn'tbehere. And thenext trainwent 

north,a city half
-
hour awa y. And that city hadbeen bombed com pletely out of existence, 
practically.W e were delayed there because two nuns were arrested and thosenunsha
ppened 
to be Germ an parachuters.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Disguised as nuns?
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Di sguised as nuns.T he train kept going for thenext seven days and 
seven nights through Southern France.W e were bombedafew tim es.W e weremachine 

gunned a few tim es
.The train stopped a couple of times. Some people got off. Som epeople 
did notm ake it back. But we got backand m y father pushed usunder the seats for better 

protection.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And Michel described f or me
 
--
 
were you 11 or 12at thispoint
 
--
 s
eeing 
people who had gotten off  thetrain, lying in thef ieldsbecausethey had been hitby 

m achine
-
gun f ire.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Ri ght.W efinally m ade itto Southern France.W e were fed through the 
windo ws of the railroad cars.T he French people gave usf ood.Andback then a French 

baguette
 
was still good. InSouthern France we were helped throughthe local com munity.
 
Aboutf ive weeks later France gave up. The capitalm ovesf rom  Paris to Vichy, m ore central 

France. My father's papers allowed him  to travel
 
still. M y m other's Persian passport got 
expired. He triedto go to Vichy to renew thepapers.All the diplom ats were gone and lef t 

France and went to Portugal m ainly. My f ather tried to get the papers. Sohe followed them to 

Portugal to see if  he could continue getting the papers.And that was the last tim e we saw him  

for a long tim e.W e were stranded in France.
 
 
From  the sm all town we went toafarm ,f riends of m y parentsf rom  the Ukraine.W e 
stayed there f or a few m onths. I learned farming. Nothing like 
taking care of  cattle, cows, lovel y 
cows, riding horses, chopping wood, whatever we could dothere. Itwas a learning experience 

which I enjoyed.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And thenat some point your fam ily decides that it's bestfor you to move to 
Ma rs e ille .
  
>> M i
chel Margosis:
 
W ell, m y m other thought to have some diplomats that maybe in Marseille. 
So we went to Marseille. And I thinkthat's when we
 
--
 
a cam pfor refugees, welcom ed us, 
provided us with bunks. But in them iddle of the nightm y m other decided shedid
n't f eel right 

about itand shedecided to get out.So it was a hugef ence,one of thoseArm y typef ence.In 

 
4
 
them iddle of the night we lif tedthe tarpand sneaked out.
 
 
Lateron,through thism useum , Ifoundout that these refugees were arrested and 
shipp
ed to Auschwitz.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So this was at leastthe second tim e that Michel'sf am ily avoided a horrible 
fa te .
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T hird time.T hef irst tim e was the bombing in Brussels.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Bom bing in Brussels, sinking of  a ship, and then
 
the reception center.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Ri ght.W e got to Marseille, and wef ounda very nice accomm odation in 
the slum s, rightnext to the railroad.Those slum s were not welcom ing.W e hardly ever saw any 
cops down therebecause they were too scared to get down there. It was a nice spacefor us. 

W ehad niceneighbors. It was aboutas diverse a group as we couldget.W ehad Italians, 

Corsicans, Arabs, lotsof Arabs, Chineseacross the squaref rom  us.W e were allf riendly. It 

was a nice place to hide.
 
>> L a
ura Green:
 
And you m a
k
e a greatf riendship and get in a lot oftrouble? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, I used to be able 
to
 
--
 
Marseille being
 
--
 
it was beautif ul weather. I 
m anaged to go to thebeach practically ever y day in the summ er. Im ade goodfriends, 

p
articularly one. His nam e was Raf ael who called him self  Cafe au lait.
 
 
Anybody know what that m eans? 
 
 
Cafe au laitm eans coffee with m ilk. Hisf ather was f rom  the Cam eroon, which had 
been aGerman colony until W orldW ar I, andhis m other wasf rom  Denmark.
 
So he called 
him self  Caf eau lait.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
And we became very clo sef riends. Used to goto hishouse practically 
ever y day. He never knew anything aboutme. Henever came to our house. And I certainly 

would not invite him  tothe
 
place we lived in.He lived right by the port. He taughtm ehow to 
swim , how to skate, how to steal, how to whatever.W ell, stealing becam e a necessity because 

food was getting scarce.
 
 
I remember som etim es I would be able to getundressedand jump right 
into the port, 
into the water.W edid a lot of  things together. Oneof  thethings I rem em bered well is spear 

f ishing. That wasf un. In a little kayak.T hat became a very im portant partof our activities, 

which I don'ttalk about.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
I believe you also told me that youdon't think Cafe au lait hadany inkling that 
you were Jewish.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W e never talked about it.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And tell everyone about who you think hisfather workedfor.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, because Cameroon had been a Germancolony, we suspected that 
he was working with the Germ ans. And being black was not necessarily a good thing in France 

at that tim e. Any m inority could not be great.But becausehe was black, he was able to do 

well. It was a nice place, nice housethat he had.
 
 
I remember they usedto play records. That'show I got acquaintedm ainly with opera 
because there was one recordI particularly li ked thatm adem e appreciate that kindof m usic. 

Andalso they were m ore intellectual.T hey spoke English
 
at home.W ell, he was French,of  
course.And he had two sisters. One was in a wheelchair. Theotherone was running around 

andnever saidhello.But they were teenagers.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Youm entioned the scarcity of food which led your m om  to a lineof  wo
rk .
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell,f ood becam e scarce and rationed. Because ourdocum entshad 

 
5
 
expired we could not get these rations som y m other went to business.W ecall it theblack 
m arket. She was able to buy things and sell itat a goodprice, particularly
 
things like cigarett es 
and chocolates, sweets. It was in good dem and andprof it was very good.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Andwhat was the penalty had she been caught selling 
on the black m arket? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, I have a picture ofher. It says blackm arket penalty is hanging. But 
it 's t h e  risk.  
 
>> Laura Green:
 
There's a soundthat you describe hearing in Marseille that signaleda really 
im portantarrival, the sound on the streets. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, that was when the allied invaded NorthAfrica, 
Novem ber
 
1942. T he 
Germ an troops just cam e down enm asse. Francehad beendivided originally into an occupied 

zone and the unoccupied zone. And the unoccupied didn't have any Germ an troops though it 

did have a lotof  Germans thatIf ound out about.W henthe allied invaded NorthAf rica,all the 

Germ an troops came down, stomping down the main drag
,  
where m y picture was taken
, 
with a 
horrif ic sound of the boots. It still resounds inm y ears, very f rightening. T hat's when we 

decided
 
--
 
m y m other said let's get out of here. She knew the Jewish comm unity there. Many 
of  them were doing black m arketing, too.
 
 
T here was afamous rabbi who alsohad escapedthere, advised m y m other about 
what to do. And we decided to escape toSpain.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And shortly af ter you lef t, you talkabout what happened to that 
neighborhood.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
I found out through thism useum  again.W henwe lef t
 
--
 
on  m y b i r t h day,  
f irst year the war started, all the Jews in Brussels were being picked up and shipped to 

Auschwitz. About
 
twom onthsor soaf ter we lef t Marseille,that neighborhood where m yfriend 
was was also ethnically cleaned andthe whole neighborhood was blown up because the 

Germ ans didn't want to be able to cope with thatneighborhood, had too many things going on.
 
I 
remember oncebeing caught in a net. 
 
 
Oneof  the things theGerm ans def enseactually did
 
--
 
and the French actually did, 
worked with theGermans, would seal the streets,pick up everybody in there, and if you didn't 

have papers, good luck. And I rem em ber escapingf rom  one of those by sneakingf rom 

house
-
to
-
house.I was able to do that with m y f riends.
 
I never foundoutf rom  my brother how 
hem anagedbecause I hardly ever saw him .
 
>> Laura Green:
 
On your way to Spain, you have I think a signif icant experience on the train.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W e took the trainf rom  Marseille backtoT oulouse tobeable totransfer to 
them ountains.Loandbehold, on the train we had Germ an troops, rif les and everything. My 

m other could not speak French.She spoke Yiddish and
 
Russian.And in order to be able to 
avoid suspicion she startedm aking signs as if  she were deaf .W e kids, of course, spoke 

French like thenatives but we caught on andwe responded in kind.And we never had any 

problem s.W e got tothe border without any problem s. But that was a pretty scary m oment.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Can you tell us a little bit about how your m other'swork enabled youto 
escape at that point? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, with them oney that she was able to earn
 
--
 
is thatthe right word? 
She 
was able to buyf orged papers tobeable to travel and to be able to get tothe border, 
saf ely because anyplace back then to travelhad inspectors, police,checking trainand 

t ra
velers.W e were able to go to
 
them ountains to an inn to relax becausem y sist
er, as an 
infant, she had the quiet polio. And thedoctors said she neededf resh air to beable todo 

better.T hat's how we were able to justif y going to them ountains. So we got that.
 

 
6
 
 
Once we were in the inn at the border we wer e approached by two cops, 
French 
policemen, national policem en. They off ered to take us across.W e resisted at f irst but then we 
didn'thave any choiceand we accepted.They were willin g to take us into Spainf ora small 

price of
 
$10,000 each. So
 
$40,000 later that took us over.
 
 A
nd,again, through this m useum  Ifoundout thatm any of those guides, passeurs, 
were will ing to accept money andthen turn over their clients to the local police.T hat 

happened,I understand, quitea bit.W e didn't know about it.I don't know what we would
 
have 
done otherwise but we had no choice.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And you also told me, I believe, thatat
 
$40,000 would have been equivalent 
to about
 
$500,000 today. Is that right?
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Cl oser toam illion. It's only m oney.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
B u t I t
hink it's stunning that your mother had theforethought to save all ofthat 
m oney because your living existence was pretty diff icult while she was saving it all.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
M y m other is theone who saved us
, th
e decisions, going to the farm, 
going
 
to Marseille. My father was in Portugal trying to get papers.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Thism ight be a goodm om ent to talkabout some letters that your fam ily
 
--
 
that you recently discovered.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T hat was much later, yes. 
 
>> Laura Green:
 
W e ca n  go
 
back to it at theappropriate tim e then.Yeah, absolutely.
 
 
So this is in Decem ber, 1942, when your fam ily is escaping through the mountains. 
Can you tell us what that experience was like? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, packed af ew things particularly because it was winter. And the 
Pyrenees mountains rise up toabout7,000
 
feet.W edidn't clim bup.W e went through it.W e 
found iteasier.W ell, the copsf ound it.W e were ableto getthrough.Weheard dogs but we 

never encountered any guards.T hose cops did a good job. So whatever they earned, I'm not 

going to quibble. I'm here.
 
 
W e got into Spain. T he cops disappeared.W e took a nap for several hours in the 
inn. And then we were advised totake Spanish guides to take us into the Spanish city. But 

instead of going through the woods,followed the railroad tracks.They said it's easier to get 

into town if  youfollow the road.
 
W ithin a couple of hours we were spotted by the Spanish 
police,arrested, and everybody was sent to jail except me becauseI was too young. I
 
wa s  
sent to an orphanage. 
 
 
Sof rom  jailm y brother was shippedtoa concentration cam p in Spain, where they 
had their own
 
--
 
just got over CivilW ar in Spain, CivilW arf rom 1936to 1939. And Franco was 
helped with his CivilWar by the Germ ans and theItalians.T he Germans provided the 

weapons. Hitler was
 
--
 
they were f riends. Franco was thinking of even joining Hitler in his war. 
But I think because the allies were getting tooclose, especially when they invaded North 

Af rica, that Franco changed hism ind
 
and decided to work with them .
 
 
W her e wa s  I ?
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Yourbrother is sent to this concentration cam p.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
H e was sent to that concentration cam p where they hadm ostly ref ugees. 
And we were sent to asm all town where they had several hotels reserved justf or refugees. 

W e were taken care of there. It was adecentplace.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
A n d an  
Am ericanagency steps in
 
next? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
It was an Americanagency, distribution comm ittee, which I think was 
founded in 1911,W orld W arI. And they subsidized us, helped us. From  the hotel we were sent 

 
7
 
to live in town with a fam ily in Barcelona, which is the largest city in Spain. Province of 
Catalonia which hasbeen called the reluctant prideof  Spain because they resisted Franco 

m o re
 
than anybody else.
 
 
W e were therefor a while. I lived therefor about six m onths. Af ter six m onthsI was 
able to learn enoughSpanish tobeableto read " Don Quixote"  which I still enjoy occasionally. I 

read it in French originally, then Spanish, and then cam ehere and read it in English. Seems 

like threediff erent stories in a way. It's like reading " Les Miserables" in French, which I just 

loved andthen I read it in English. But I dida lot of reading while I wa s in Marseille. I was able 

to get to abookstoreand do a lotof  reading.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So whatdecisiondoes your m otherm ake withoutconsulting you? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T he Am erican organization offered to help children under 16 to save them 
out of  Europe. And m y m other signed me up. She didn
't askm e. She just signed me up. And in 

Ma y
 
1943, she said goodbye. I said goodbyeto thefam ily
, s
ister, brother,mother. I took the 
train to Madrid
, p
ickedup another loadof kids, about20or so kids.W e went to Lisbonfor the 
ship where I saw m y father after three years.He greetedm e.W e had been corr
esponding. He 
greetedm e, he said" You now are am an." So heoff eredm ea cigarette. I didn'ttell him  I 

started smoking before, but atany rate.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
And we said goodbye. I stayed with him  for afew days. T hen I tookthe 
s h ip
, l
eaving thef am ily behind.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
W eshould also tell everyone that the American agency helped get your 
brotherout. So he was safe.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Mm
-
h mm .
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Right? Your brother was nolonger in the concentration cam p.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Ever ybody who were living
 
--
 
they were in Barcelona together, living with 
a Spanish fam ily.
 
 
Soon af ter that,m y sister signed up to go toPalestine because in Marseille she had 
f a lle n  in lo v
e with a Palestinian who was studying in France. He was abletoescape to Spain 
also. And whenhe wanted to gobackhom e,she said she would go, too. But by that time she 

also was a scientist. My brother was advised to go with her asa chaperon. I'm glad I
 
wasn't 
there.They went to Palestine. My m otherhired another guy to take her to Portugal. And she 

rejoined m y father.
 
 
And I cam ehere. I landed
 
--
 
well, we stopped topick up a loadof  cork and wine and 
P o rt o
 
in Portugal. Then we went to
 
--
 
m ade a stop 
in  t h e
 
Azores, Portuguese island inthe 
Atlantic.I rem em ber that stop because I remem berthe little boatsaround the ship with people 

selling their wares or whatever. I was able tobuy two pineapples. Iwas so hungry those days 

to som eextent.I was very thin then, too.I had lost
 
--
 
well, that's another story. ButI bought 
two pineapples whichseveral days later I truly enjoyed because they had f ermented to som e 

e xte n t. 
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T henI also remembered in thefarm , drinkingm ilk directly f rom  the cow 
which was ver
y 
enjoya ble. Didn't have to heat it. Justdrink it. 
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So your ship com es into Philadelphia. Is that right?
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Ship com es intoPhiladelphia. Saw the netting in the skies.I thoughtthey 
were 
greeting ref ugees. These were just airplanesor whatever because the war was on 
already, 1943.W e were imm ediately putona train to New York to aplace called theBronx. 

 
8
 
Never heard of it bef ore. W e stayed theref oraf ew days. I hada cousin
 
--
 
m y fa the r
 
had an 
uncle in Brooklyn. Andthedaughter cam e to visit m e in the Bronx, showed me America by 
taking m e toa place called Radio City Music Hall. T hat was all right.
 
 
Af ew days later she took me to live with them in Brooklyn. So I wentto Brooklyn. I 
liv
ed with them  f or a f ew m onths. About Septem ber
 
--
 
I didn't know a word of English except 
what I saw in them ovies. You know, them ovies in Europeareusually dubbedbut occasionally 

we get new ones. AndI remember things like " I love you." " All right," " Ok." T hat's about the 

extent. But I cam e to Brooklyn anddidn't know anything.
  
 
T hat September,that tookm e to school.I had a vacationfor three years. So I 
startedhigh school.The advisor who tookm e in was a French teacher so I was able to be 

helped with them .Andhe was soon drafted after that. So Itook English and civics and m ath. I 

think I f lunked everythi ng.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Butby the second year?
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Second year I was reading Shakespeare," Midsumm er Night's Dream" . 
My junior year I
 
took physics. I didn't like it abit. My senior year I took chem istry andI just 
loved it. Theteacher was justfabulous. Really m ade itfascinating. Idecided to gof rom  

journalism  to chem istry.
 
 
My parents cam e in May
 
1946, and I graduated just afew m onths later. Idecided to 
go to college andmajor in chem istry. I m adehigh school in three and ahalf  years with honors. 

I joined clubs. Ihadafriend inSpain who we m ade a chess setandI became pretty good at 

chess, competing inthe clubthere, and the
 
French club inhigh school, math club,and 
chem istry club.I was living it up.
 
 
T hen I appliedto college. I was accepted in ever y school I 
had applied, Brooklyn 
Co lle ge ,  Cit y C
ollege, Miam i University of Ohio, afew m ore.Butthen because m y parents 

newl
y arri ved, I decided I didn't want to leave so I stayed in New Yor k. I went to Brooklyn 
College. If ound that test tobe very hard, theentrance test.Butactually I found that getting out 

of  it evenharder but I m ade it. Im ajored in chem istry. I was active there,founded the
 

Chem istry Society News, the French group. It was good learning. I'm  good at school.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
And there's a period of time when you were draf ted. Is that right? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
As soon as I was
 
--
 
as Igraduated, I received
 
a draf tnotice that said this 
is the KoreanW ar, Uncle Sam wants you. I thoughthealready hadm e.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Because Ifound out later on thatI was a ward of  the stateand Ididn't 
even know that. Atone tim e I was also
 
--
 
o h ,  I 
didn'tmention that. Af ter staying with af am ily for 
af ew m onths, that couldn't affordm e because they had lost everything during the 
D
epression, 
I became afoster child and I went to afoster home.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Thiswas when he was in high school earning honors and is in af oster hom e.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T hen whenm y parentscam e here.
 
I lef ta nice comfortable home in 
Brooklyn to go to the slum sof  east New York. Anybody heard of  D
elancy 
S
treet? Not far f rom  
there.W ell, we improved over the years. 
 
 
Oneevening af ter graduation we were having af arewell party for m y going into the 
A rm y
 w
hen I receiveda phone call that same evening. If  I can get ajob asa chemist, I canbe 
def erredf rom  the Army. I thought it was a joke. So thef ollowing day I calle
d t he  d r af t  bo a r d 

and verif ied, indeed, if  I could get a job,I would be deferred. SoI did. My f irst prof essional job 

as a chem ist,
 
$40a week in Newark, New Jersey. It took me over half m y salary to get there 
f rom  Brooklyn but I worked asa chem ist, m yf
irs t  job .  
 

 
9
 
 
I had a lot of different jobs until then like selling hotdogs and otherthings, delivery 
boy. I didn't like som e of the things that was going on in that chem ical
 
--
 
pharm aceutical 
com pany. I gotanother job som ewhereelse in theBronx.
 
 
T hen I
 
decided that becauseI didn't caref orwhat I was doing, checking on products, 
on thepharm aceutical products, but becauseI could speak Russian, even though I couldnot 
read nor write, I would be a better help to thegovernm ent during the ColdWar. So I decided to 

enlist into the Arm y.
 
 
Again I said goodbye to thef am ily. Part of thef am ily was here already. I reportedto 
Fo
rt Dix, s wore in, and 16 weeks of basic training, learning every weapon there was to learn in 
the infantry. I becam ean infantrym an
. 
I
n 16weeks I becam e a killer. 
 
 
But I applied to the language schoolbecause I wantedtohelp with the Russian. So I 
waited for m y orders.Ever ybody got their orders. Everybody went to Korea except me. I still 

waited for m y orders. 
I f inally got them. T hey said, ﬁW
e can't send you to language schoolto 
learn Russian. You're a chem ist. You're alsoalready classif ied as aFrench andSpanish 

interpreter. Forget it.
ﬂ 
 
First shif t I went out I went to Europe. So that's where I went. I ended up in 
Ge rm an y. I go  to m y C.O. an d  sa id , 
ﬁG
etm e the hell out of Germany. I'm not going to stay 
because I justescaped f rom  here, som ething's going to happen.
ﬂ 
So they sent me to France 
across the border. 
 
 
W ell, I was home.T hat was m y language. I became a chem ical supply sp
e c ia lis t .  
W hat does that do?W ell, we have gas m asks over there. You justm ove them over there. 

Move grenadesf rom  there to there. Finished. Reverse theprocess. S
o I did that f or a while 
until I getemergency leave. My f ather hadtaken ill. 
 
 
I came hom efor 30 days. By the tim eI got here hehad died. So after 30 days 
helping m y mother set up, I went back to France. I came back asa chemical supply specialist 

until they neededam edic just af ew m iles away, about 40
 
m iles away, they needed a medic in 
the 
hospital and Iappliedfor the job. Af ter all, chem istry is basically pharm acy which is 
basically hospital if  you can relate.SoI becam eam edic. Learningon
-
th e
-
job training how to 
gi ve shots. Andthe shots were great, used big, thick needles with penicillin. You could cure the 

whole world. 
 
 
And that's what happened.
 
Af ter two years I decided to becom ea civi lian again in 
spite of their offer to makem eanoff icer.I didn't want tobeanoff icer. I just wanted to get out. I 

served m y tim e.I didm y duty.
 
The KoreanW ar was practically over. I gotm y outpay and 
eventually went to New York f or two monthsdeciding what I wanted
 
to do. I appliedfor a job at 
Brookhaven 
Na t io na l L
aboratory and started workin g as a chem ist,atom ic energy.W ork
ed  
there 
fo r a  fe
w m onthsuntil Idecided I wanted to go on learning, so Iwent to go back to 
school.I went back to New York, went to live with m y m other,and gotm y Masters.
 
 
I had af riendof m inewho was teaching m ath whom  Ihad known f rom the school 
bef ore. W e used to
 
play chess together. And he was am athm ajor.He just gothis Ph.D. and 
he was teaching in Brooklyn. He offered to introduceme to anice young lady. Because I 

off ered to take him  hom e. I was studying at night. Andhe was teaching at night. I was work ing 

during theday. And Ihad my car and hedidn't have his.So I offered to takehim hom e. And he 

off ered to stop at the young lady's to introduce me. So we stopped there about 10:00
 
in the 
evening.W em et. Shehad coffee that she had made in them orning because she was also 

going to school. I called the next day, m adea date. And six weeks later we were m arried.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 

 
10
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T hree dates, six weeks.
 
An d
 
we had to wait forher brother to com ef rom  
theW est Coast to come to the wedding. That's wh y we waited so long.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
So today I can say I had a wife, we had two kids and three grandchildren 
andfour grand dogs. 
 
 
Brookhaven
 
--
 
I was offeredaf ellowship in Florida State University. I went out to 
T allahassee, was ableto withstand it fora year, and then cam e back northand got a job in 
Delaware f oraboutf ive years. I was doing som e researchbut because I couldnotpublish 

because the industry does not liketopublish
 
--
 
they're af raid youm ay reveal toom uch. 
S o  I 
applied f or governm ent. 
 
 
I  s t ill re m em be r t he f irst  jo b  
where Ithought the boss was unethicalwith certain 
things and I said if  I ever get to work with thegovernm ent,I'm  goingto stop these people. So I 

f inally got a job with the Food and Drug Administration. I was involved with approving of new 

antibiotics. Ibecam e an expert in theanalysis , in the chem ical analysis, of  antibiotics.T hat 

was a challenge because before that I usedto bebiological. And I converted thatf rom  

biological to chem ical.
 
 
So what else? I was elected by the 
B
o a r d of  
S
upervisors of  Fairf ax Countyf or the 
Hum an R
i gh t s  
C
omm issionf rom  which I just recently retired because as we started tom ention 
bef ore, whenm y f ather
 
--
 
well, I should say my parents cam e tothiscountry in
 
Ma y
 
1946. To 
theday, six years af ter the war started inBelgium ,m y sister marrieda Frenchm an,nottheguy 

that shefollowed toPalestinebutthe guy she m et on the train in Spain that went to the ship. 

He escaped. He served in the Frenchunderground. He went to Spain, went to Palestine, 

enlisted in the Jewish brigade tof ight with the British Arm y. Andhewent back tof ight in 

Holland andItaly. She hadanArm y wedding in Israel.Af ter returning to Israel he joined the 

Haganah. But, again 
because of the
 
f ood shortage in Israel, cam ehere.W e convinced him to 
com e toAmerica. My brother was in the Kibbutz.
 
He cam e. It took us13 years to get back 
together but we all m ade it back.
 
 
W hen m y f at h er  d i e d
 
--
 
we
ll, while we were all  separated m y father was in P
ortugal, 
m y m other inSpain,my siblings in Israel, and I was here,m y fathersaved all the mail thatwe 

wrote tohim. And when he died,m y m other inherited that.W hen she died,my sister inherited 

that. And then when my sister died, her son got it.And I f inally f ound outabout it when he 

cam e tom y grandson's bar m itzvah last year. And now I'm  readingover 400 letters in French 

about whatm y sister and brother were thinking and writing about. Mostly the com plaints were 

about lackof food, lack of m oney, lack of facilities, lack of  everything. I'm  still reading it but that 

was the main reasonIgave up the Human Rights Comm ission.I'mstill reading it.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Oneof  the interesting things that Michel talked tom eabout ishe can tell f rom  
th e  lette
rs thathisf ather would be writing, asking sort of  like what'sthedelay, are you trying to 
com e, are you trying to get papers andhis brother and sister would be writing to his father and 

saying can you 
talk toour uncle in America
, c
an you talk tothe British consulate
.  
Everyone is 
writing back andf orth trying to f igureout why can they notm akem ore progress to get out. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, becauseof m y father's training
 
--
 
he hadthis teacher back in 
Russian, a f am ous poet. T here's a m useum  in 
Tel Aviv. As a result, he could speak seven 
different languages. By thetim e he cam ehere I was able to speaktohim  in Frenchand in 

English. I didn't know any Portuguese.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
I think we m ight have a few minutesfor questions if this is a good
 
t i m e  f o r 
you.
 

 
11
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Sure.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Great. Sopeople will be coming through the audience with m icrophones.If 
you can just wait until you have am icrophone toask your question, that would be great.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
A hand over ther
e.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Som eone's com ing here.
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Laura Green:
 
She's asking if letters were the only wa y that you were able to com municate.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
Oh, no.W e wrote to each other all the tim e. But we never expressed
 
--
 
we never talked aboutour experience. My f ather used to write
 
--
 
especially when he wrote to 
thefosterhom e, he was telling them  how wonderful I was
 
doing in school.I was a marvelous 
student.I didn't tell him that.W e comm unicated.W e were always in c ommunication. Even 
thougha lot of  scribblings were blacked outbecause of the censors.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Another question? 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
I took the tim etoEurope onour 15thanniversary.W e stopped in 
Marseille. I tookm y wife to Marseille, trying to show her the slum s that she didn't want to see 

because she thought she saw somebody with  a knife inhis mouth, like apirateor whatever. 

But I went tothe authorities trying to f ind out.I couldn'tf ind outanything about him . 
 
 
I also got in touch withthe German archives that we all work with, the greatest 
archives thatexisted in Germany, trying to f ind out about afarmer who tookus inandm y 

f riend Rafael.And their names were not in there which m eans to methatthey were saf e. Had 

t
hey been picked up, they would have been listed there. So Ifeel comfortable that they wer e all 
righ t. 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
I d id n 't qu ite ge t tha t. 
 
>> Laura Green:
 
She's m entioning the international quality of  yourf am ily but the 
m icrophone 
seem s to be doing som ething. 
 

>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W henm y father escaped f rom  Siberia, hef ound ref uge inPersia. He had 
a colleague over therewho helped him  to becom e aPersian citizen.So we were all Persians 

a t the  ti
m e.So when Ibecam ea citizen m yself ,I had to relinquish that citizenship, which I 
didn'tm ind at all because I never knew anything about it.If ound outthrough thehistory books 

thatthere was such an empire that was greatback then.T oday it's called 
Iran. We're not too 

f riendly with them . That's the history of the world.W e make f riends. W e lose f riends.W e make 

enem ies, lots of them.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Is there another question? 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Could you repeat the question agai
n? 
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Laura Green:
 
She's asking aboutthe concentration cam p, whereyour brother was held, 
and whether the experience was at all sim ilarto what we know of Germ an camps.
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, the Germ an cam ps
 
--
 
I thinkevery e
xterm ination cam p Germany 
had was in Poland. Most of these other camps were not exterm ination cam ps as such.The 

cam p in Spain wasm ainly as a result of the Civi lW arthat they had in Spain.And originally 

they were f or theSpanish prisoners.
 
 
Is th at ad e q
uate? 
 

 
12
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Do we have any m ore questions? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
T hatm eans you know ever ything? 
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Ok. If th e fo lks at the m ic
 
--
 
oh, ok.

[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ell, I like to claim that Ihadtwo techniquestokeep m e well. One is 
m usic, which I learned
 
--
 
the opera that I learned at m yf riend's house, and them usic. And 
humor.W hen I was running the Parkinson'ssupport group here, whenm y wif e had 
Parkinson's, I was appointed the Hum or Editor of  the bulletin.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W ithout hum or, it's difficult to live, especially in this world.W e need it.So I 
have a list in Frenchand Spanish. Ialsohave an adult onebutI don't talkabout it. And I still 

keep it up.
 
>> Laura Gr
een:
 
Yo u em a il t h is  lis t , righ t ?
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
I em ail jokes every day to a list that I have. 
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>>
 
Can we get on thatlist?
 
>> Laura Green:
 
She'd like to geton your list. 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
I sent Irish jokes tom y congressm an. 
M y c o
ngressm an is a great guy, 
Gerry Connolly, in Virginia, and we became goodf riends. So I don'tsendtohis off ice. I send to 

his hom etohis wif e. But he reads them  all. And he keeps insisting, please sendm e Irish 

jokes. Andhe's willing to use thosethat 
are acceptable.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Laura Green:
 
Michel, I've asked you anum berof  tim esaboutexperiences that you had that 
sound incredibly f rightening tom e, likem achine gunning thetrain that you were in, and 

actually seeing people injured anddie.I have askedabout your responseto that and I'm  

alwa ys surprised by the way you answer about whether you were scared inthese m oments. 
 

>> Michel Margosis:
 
I guess I was scared.I rem ember inbasic training som ething called 
inf iltration course where we were supposed to crawl around with machine guns f iring. One of  

the kids got up and got shot.T hat was notfarf rom m e. So experience
 
--
 
you learn to live wi th 
it, keep on going. 
 

 
My wif ehad Parkinsons. I took care of herfor 12 years, cooked, took care of her
. S o  
we do what we can wit h what we have.W ehave to makethe best of  it
, e
specially today.
 
>> Laura Green:
 
So our tradition at
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
is to have our FirstPerson close theprogram . 
I'd like to thank youall ver y m uchfor being here.W ehopethat you
 
wi ll com e back.W ehave 
our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program everyW ednesday andThursday until them iddle of August. Michel 
here will have the last word.
 
 
B ef o r e I  
turn back to him , I'd like to let you know that at the endof  our program  we 
like to ask ourphotographer, Joel, will com e to the stageand take aportrait. So if  you canall 

rem ain in your seats,Michel wil l be up hereand Joel will shoot itf rom this direction. 
 
 
So with that, Michel,do you m ind giving us your closing remarks? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 J u st  
afew words that Ihave written. BecauseI cannot rely onm y m em ory 
anym ore.I'm approaching 100 years of age.Slowl y.

[Laughter] 
 
>> Michel Margosis:
 
W e know the Holocaustas a tim e when the spark of  evil f lared
 
into a 
r a gi n g f i r e  t h at  en
gulfed much of
 
Europe. I was alone when I cam eto Am erica in June
 
19 43 ,  

 
13
 
just a couple of weeks before the invasionof Sicily. It was also around the tim ethat a raceriot 
blazed in Holland andJews and otherm inorities were not acceptedever ywhere in this country. 

Ye s ,  
Am erica has grown a bit but the consum ing em bersof  discrim ination,bigotry and 
intolerance have never been extinguished. Voices of  ignorance,econom icdegrees,political 

and religious zealots have resurged and arespreading those oldfears that are splitt
i n g t he  
world asunder andperpetuating genocidal, racial, and ethnic conf lict. Progress means we m ust 

em braceour expanding diversit y and support education morefully at all levels and get to know 

our neighbors betterfor Am ericaand the world tobecome a 
better and m ore secure place for 
our children and grandchildren to live happily, gro w and prosper. 
 
 
Oncem ore, I'm  reaff irm ing m y own legacy with memoriesf rom  those dreadf ul days 
as well as those happily deri ved af terwards. As I am  bearing witness to the
 
Holocaust, I leave 
it to this greatm useum and to you, all of you,to ensure that it will be remembered.
 
 
Hate and genocide must be banishedf rom  this earthto survi ve. T his nation becam e 
a world leader prim arily becauseof  itsm oralvalues and innovative
 
science and technology 
that you canembracewithoutf ear.Learn about your country and the issues troubling it.
 
If you want dem ocracy to thrive, know your ri ghts and use them
 
judiciously
