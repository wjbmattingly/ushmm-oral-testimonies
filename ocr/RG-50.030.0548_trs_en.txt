Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
José Co ltof
, conducted by 
Ina Navazelskis
 onNovember 9
th
, 2008 in
 Alexandria, 
Virginia . 
Thank you very much
 for agreeing to talk to us today, 
José.
 We really Œ 
Answer: 
José.  
Q: Œ appreciate it. 
José, 
sorry. Let™s start  like we always
 do in these interviews, at 
the beginning. Tell me  about your Œ your
 family, tell me about where you were 
born, the circumstances, your mo th er, father, brother, sisters. 
A: Okay. I come from a typical Dutch Jewi
sh mid d le cla ss fa mily . My  mo th er came 
from a family of five, she had two brothers
, two sisters and parents, and ev erybody 
was married. My father came 
from a family of three, he
 had two sisters. One was 
married and had six kids, and th e other one 
never married. My father™s sister with 
the six kids had only one surviv ing child, 
my cousin, who was my  only surv ivor 
other than my mother, th
at survived the war. 
Q: What were their names 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Their names were Œ  my mother™s name 
Œ my mother™s maid Œ my mother™s name 

was
 Hannah Feldman
(ph), her maiden name was 
Feldman
(ph), and my father™s 
name was 
Marwitz
(ph)
 Farp
(p h). And my  father dealt in animal hides, and my  
mo ther Œ my  grandfather del Œ was a butch
er, a ko Œ kosher butcher. And everybody 
lived in
 Amsterdam
 at the time, except my grandpare
nts on my  mo ther™s side, they

moved ab out 10 years before, to 
The Hague, 
for health reasons. My grandfather 
had some respiratory problems and th e doct
or suggested that he should be near the 
salt sea air, so th
ey moved to th e Œ
 The Hague
. And th e life was, you know, very 
typical, like in the Dutch way. We were
 a religious family and life was good, 
everybody Œ 

Q: Did you have a Œ br
others and sisters? 

A: My mo th er had Œ my  parents married 
in 1929, and two year
s later my mother 
had a child, a Œ a daughter, called
 Judith
, who had some sort of a disease that they 
couldn™t treat at the time, at the Œ when sh
e ate, sh-she vomited or she had diarrhea, 
and they  couldn™t stop it, and eventually, 
at age two, she died. So  I never knew Œ 
[coughing]
 Œ sorry. 
Q: That™s all right, mm-hm. 

A: Œ another sibling. Bu t sh Œ they did 
have another child. And th en, I™m the only 

child. 
Q: Well, tell me a little bit Œ I mean, if yo
u were born in 1942, as it says here on our 
Œ our questionnaire, tell me 
a little bit about the circum
stances you heard of when 
the war erupted. What happ
ened with your parents? 
A: Okay , okay. 
Q: What happened be
fo re your birth?

A: Okay, okay. My mother, 
it™s very ironic that she and I are the only ones that 
survived. When
 ﬁMein Kampfﬂ
 was written, my mother was very smart, and she 
says, this guy is not fooling around. He™s r
eally gonna kill us all. We better get the 
hell out of here. And a lot of Du
tch Jews had the misconception th at
 Holland
 would 
stay neutral. And why was th
at? Because during World War I, 
Holland
 stayed 
neutral. And they figured Œ so th ey said
, well, even if, you know, the war breaks 
out, we™ll just stay neutral in 
Holland
 and we have noth ing to  wo rry about. And my  
mo ther was very smart and she says, we may want to stay neutral, but 
Hitler
 won™t 
let us. And she made everybody crazy, said, 
let™s get out, we have to get out of here. 
If we Œ th Œ it™s not good, we mu st leave 
Europe.
 She was obsessed with leaving 
Euro pe
 and going to 
America
. And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in
 
Holland, 
like I said, they Œ they
 all thought nothing was 
gonna happen there. And 
there were other people like my mother. 
My Œ as a matter of fact, after I got 
married, my father-in-law Œ my Œ my husband
™s grandfather was the same  thing, he 
also saw it come. And it got to the point 
that people didn™t invite him any mo re, 
because they didn™t want to hear this doom
saying, and i Œ this Œ they didn™t want to 
get depressed, and th ey  said he™s crazy. 
And that™s how a lot of people felt. My 
whole fami ly could have been saved, becau
se my  mo ther had a brother whose wife

had a sister in 
England
, in
 Lo ndo n
, married to a famous 
hazan
 there, and she 
would have Œ 
Q: Can you tell me what that is, 
hazan
? 
A: A cantor. 

Q: A cousin? A cantor. 

A: A cantor, a cantor. 

Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm. 
A: And she would have happ
ily you Œ you know, let ever
ybody come. But they just 
didn™t see it, they just thou
ght that everybody that said
, let™s get out, let™s get out, 
let™s go crazy. So finally my mother said, 
okay, if nobody will 
listen to me, I™ll try 
to get papers on my  own, and I™ll leave on 
my own. And she went, as she told me, 
she went already to the American consul
ate and started to get things going a little 
bit. But of course, then the war broke 
out and she got stuck like everybody else. 
Q: And the war broke out when ? 

A: The war broke out May Œ I believe 
it was May 10 Œ in May, was May 10
th
 or 
May 15
th
. Broke out in 
May 1940, in 
Holland.
 
Q: Okay .

A: And she got stuck. So then  I was born,
 and even  already be
fore I was born, in 
beginning of 1942, things started to get Œ the 
very first year or so, things weren™t so 
bad yet. 
Q: Can I ask a few questions about that? 
A: Yeah, sure. Of course. 

Q: Were you born in your family™s home? 

A: No, I was born in  the
 CI Z
, it w as called. Th-The Central Israeli 
Ziekenhuis.
 It 
was th-the Jewish hospital in 
Amsterdam
. 
Q: Okay. But your parents s
till lived in their own home? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did they still have Œ 
A: They had an apartment, 
and they lived in their apar
tment, yes. And th en what 
they did is, the men were called up to so-c
alled wo rk camp , and the Dutch are very 
gullible, and they said, well maybe if we do 
as we™re told, it won™t so bad if we Œ 
you know, don™t try to get aw
ay with something. And my
 mother again was smart, 
and she says Œ my  father was Œ I was born in
 March 4, 1942, and they started to call 
up th e men, and my  father™s call-up came an
d my mother said, le
t™s go in tohiding. 
Being that my father was dealing in animal
 hides, he knew every farmer in town, 

 
Interview with José Coltof

and he was apparently  a very nice man. 
And somebody would have gladly put him 
up. No, no, no, I™ll go, I™ll go. And Œ 
Q: This was in 
Amsterdam
? 
A: This was in 
Amsterdam
. And he never went into hiding. Then , when  I was four 
months old, my  father left. They Œ people ha
d to go to the train statio n and at s Œ at 
the platform of the train station, my moth
er said, I beg of you, don™t go. Co me Œ 
come with me, come, let™s go into hiding. 
He went. That was th
e last time she ever 
saw him. 

Q: And you never knew  him? 

A: Of course not, of course Œ I was four 
months old. So th en
 what happened, she 
went home to the apartment. And one nigh
t, not long after my father had left, 
maybe a couple of days later, whatever, 
the Nazis came, you 
know, they came and 
did house searches to take 
people out. And she went upstairs to the bedroom and 
she put the covers under her head. 
[tape break] 
Q: All right. Okay, sh Œ co
vers were over her head. 
A: So, the covers were over 
her head, and it™s like a miracle, I was a four month old 
baby, mo st of the time babies cry, right? I 
don™t know, instincts, I didn't cry. And it 
was dark, and my mother describes they Œ 
they had flashlights and they went over 
the Œ with the flashlight and 
said Œ and then one said to 
his partner, said, ah, there™s

nothing here, let™s get out. At 
that point my mother said, th
is is getting a little bit too 
hot, we better go into  hiding. So my  mo ther 
had an address. Her 
si st er worked in a 
bakery . 
Q: Did your mo ther, by the way, was she a 
homemaker, or wi Œ did she also have a 
job someplace? 
A: No. No, no, she was a typical Œ 

Q: Homemaker. 
A: Œ 
[indecipherable]
 homemaker, yeah. And her sister
 work ed in  this bakery . And 
one of her customers said to her once, if 
you ever need a place to hide, or any of 
your family, this is our addr
ess. And sh-she gave her the 
[indeciphera ble] 
to my 
mo ther, so my  mo ther had that address. And 
after this little incident, she went over 
there. 
Q: Can I st Œ interrupt again for a second? 

A: Of course. 
Q: By this point, was the rest of the fa
mily still not believing the danger that was 
going on? I mean, I Œ I take it that what you
 are telling me  now is a retelling as your 
mo ther explained it to you, wh at happened. 

A: Right. Of course, of course.

Q: And Œ and while one 
could be incredulous a
nd not believe it when 
ﬁMein 
Kampfﬂ
 comes out in 1920 Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ in the 1920s, by th e time you™re ro
lling around and it™s 1940 and people are 
being taken away and there™s searches, th
en that could change a few minds. What 
was that like? I me an, did she ev er talk about that? 

Q: By Œ by then you
 couldn™t get out, unless you 
had li Œ you had a lot of money 
and a lot of connections. By the time pe
ople realized, yeah, that maybe she was 
right, you tried to get out, it was almo st im
possible. You had to, as I said, lots of 
money and lots of connec
tions, and lots of luck. 
Q: I see. 

A: My in -laws got out, I can tell you ab out that
 later, that™s nothi
ng to do with me 

particularly, but they  did get out in 1940, 
four months after the invasion. Bu t by the 
time the people realized, it was too la
te, it real Œ really was too late. 
Q: I see. 

A: There was nothing you could do. 

Q: Okay , okay. So  let™s go back , she has this address Œ 
A: So, she has this address, and she goes 
to this family, and they let her in, and 
Amsterdam
 was the mo re Protestant family. The sou-southern part of 
Holland
 was 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
11
more Catholic, bordering
 Belgium
. The northern part in 
Amsterda m 
was more 
Protestant, but there were also Catholic fa
milies, they just te
nded to have bigger 
families, I guess they didn™t believe in birth 
contro l or whatever, th
ey just tended to 
have bigger families. And th at particular fa
mily also they had a bunch  of daughters. 
There was about six kid Œ five, six kids in
 the family, seven, whatever, I don™t know 
exactly. And so my mother was 35 at that
 point, and th ey had a bunch of daughters 
all in their 30s, so my  mo ther could blend 
in. My mo ther also did not look Jewish at 
all. My mo ther could easily have blende
d in. Some of the Ca
tholics looked more 
Jewish than she did, so Œ she was a little
 woman, she was sli
ght, and sh e did no Œ 
my  friend here to see Œ no, Mama, no, didn™t
 look Jewish at all.
 So, she blended in. 
So they let her in, and wh
ile she was there, not very
 long, they said look, 
Annie
, 
they™re Œ she went by the name
 Annie
 Œ they said
 Annie
, you know, we Œ we want 
you to stay and you™re welcom
e to stay with us, but you 
have to find a place for the 
child, because our neighbors 
know that none of my  daughters were pregnant, and 
when  all of a sudden a baby cries, and a ba
by appeared, th ey know
 that something is 
up, and the baby will give us all away. An
d my mother realized, of course, they 
were right, and she certainly didn™t want to
 jeopardize their life and her life and my 
life, so she set about finding a place for me. And she really didn™t have a place. But 

apparently, from what she to
ld me, there was an org Œ 
an underground organization 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
12
consisting of doctors, nurses 
and medical students. And if
 you needed a place for a 
child, you could go there, a
nd they would place the child. 
Q: But she didn't  know them pe
rsonally? She didn™t know the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, no, she ju st went to that or
gani Œ it was an undergro und organization, 
like, you know, like anything. So, my  mo ther
 went there and she said, I have a four 
months old that needs to be 
placed, do you have a spot fo
r her? And they said, okay, 
on su ch and such a day, a couple will a
ppear, and they will take your child away; 
they will take your child in
to hiding. And they tried to
 match up the couples with 
the ages. Like, if there was a teenager, th
ey wouldn™t give it a couple in their early 
20s, that would look out of pl
ace, you didn™t want to 
walk Œ so, like I was four 
months old, so they gave me to a couple
 in their 20s. And my  mo ther did, and Œ 
Q: Must have been a to ugh day for her. 

A: And, as she describes, she packed my 
things, and she put a few special things in 
there, like a Œ what do you call that thing? 
Q: A rattle? 
A: A rattle. A special rattle and some othe
r things. And I had 
a little birthmark on 
my thigh, I think, but I don™t have it a
ny mo re, but I had that. And she figured if 
when  the war is over, and sh e didn™t Œ n
obody knew wh en it would be over, and a 
four months old, after a year you don™t 
recognize your own ch ild, she would ask for 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
13
the things, at least she would 
be able to identify her ow
n child. Which, by the way, 
is exactly what happened. And Œ 
Q: Smart lady. 
A: Œ I can just imagine my poor mothe
r, two strangers come to the door, and she 
handed me to two strangers, not knowing if
 she would ever see me again. In the 
beginning of the war from ol Œ this is a
ll what she told me, 
they would tell the 
parents where they took the 
children. The Nazis soon foun
d out about that, and they 
would get the parents and torture them 
long en ough th at it would give away the 
address of the children. By the time I was 
hidden, my  mo ther wasn™t told anything. 
They wouldn™t tell me wha Œ wh
at ci-ci Œ what city I went to, who I went to, where, 
she knew nothing, just handed me, and that
 was it. I was extrao
rdinarily fortunate. 
Why? Because I came to a childless couple 
who were absolutely fantastic to me , 
who loved me dearly, who did everything and anything 
in their power to make 
things bearable– 
Q: We were talking about
 your foster parents. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And Œ and your luck . 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
14
A: As I said, they were very Œ th ey were
 a childless couple, ex
traord inarily nice to 
me, and what was my luck? Number one that
 they were childless.
 In a way that was 
very lucky because they 
put all their love and Œ 
you know, devotion to me. 
Q: Yes?  
A: And for some reaso n , I stayed with
 them the whole war. They Œ I guess we 
clicked. 

Q: So your earliest real me
mo ries would be of them. 
A: Of course. So, but Œ well, why I say 
I was lucky, because I have many friends 
that were in hiding, and th
ey were bounced from place to
 place to place. And that 
was a terrible th-thing. Every time you were 
attached to somethin
g, you know, they 
Œ they had to leave again, for a variety 
of reasons. That™s why I consider myself 
lucky that they were
 good people. They 
treated me like their own. Their extended 
family were very good. My 
foster mo ther had a brother, a-and a s Œ a sister and 
mother-in-law that lived in 
town, and their children, th
ey were good to me. Her 
parents lived in town. They 
were all very good to me. A
nd ber Œ being a very  good 
[indecipherable]
 I mean, the neighborhood Œ I wa s wa Œ hidden in a town called
 
Utrecht
. 
Q: Oh yeah. 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
15
A: And I was hidden in an area called 
rivier er buurt
, which means the river Œ the 
river neighborhood. Why? Because a lot of 
the streets were named after rivers. And 
apparently there were a lot of Jewish ch ildren hidden in that
 neighborhood. So Œ 
and the underground knew abou
t that. So, when they stag ed a raids, most of the 
time, the underg round had enough time to 
ring th e doorbell and said, get the kids 
out of here, a raid is coming. And guess wh
ere they took me? To her parents, to her 
sister and brother-in-law and their 
children. So not 
only did they  Œ 
Q: Also in 
Utrecht
? 
A: All na Œ all in 
Utrecht,
 yes. So, not only  did they th
emselves risk their life, her 
parents, her sister and brother-in-law, th
eir children. I me an, it™s unbelievable, and 
they were all good to me, I have the fonde
st of memories. I was playing with their 
children Œ 

Q: I™d like to ask you abou
t your earliest memories, then. Now we™re at a point of 
your story where it™s no longer as it was told to you Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ but wh ere you start Œ 

A: I re Œ 
Q: Œ rememb ering things. Can you tell me
, what are those things you remember? 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
16
A: Probably I rememb er being with them, be
ing with my foster parents. I remember 
them Œ 
Q: Did you call them
 Mo mmy  and  Po ppy ? 
A: Of course, of course. 

Q: So they were yo
ur Mommy  and Po ppy. 
A: Oh, th ere™s no question. And her parents were 
Oma 
and 
Opa
 and Œ and her 
sister and brother-in-law were, you know, 
Ome
 and 
Tante
, aunt and uncle, of 
course, of course. And they 
were my  cousins, no questio
n. Of course, it was lucky 
for their part also that I wa
s a baby when I came there. A  
child that comes at a y ear 
or two had a recollection of 
their parents, can give it all away by saying something 
wrong. I didn™t know anything but them, so
 I could never speak out of tur-turn, I 
could never say anyt
hing wrong, because all I knew wa
s them. I remember going to 
look for food. They  would go out of town  
to the farms, I think Œ and buy some f Œ 
get some food. And I rememb er they went
 on like a Œ a car, a flat car with big 
wheels, and somebody would pull it. And it 
was like Œ like a hay Œ like today kids 
would go on a hayrid e, and it was kind of
 Œ of an adventure for a child. And th ey 

told me we™re gonna look fo
r food. I remember those things very clearly. We went, 
you know, as often as
 we could, whatever they coul
d get. I rememb er whenever I 
went outside, if you look at me, brown eyes
 and brown hair Œ br
own hair, and as a 

 
Interview with José Coltof

child too, I was, for 
Holland
, a very Jewish looking chil
d. And whenever we went 
outside, I was told to look down
 so that my eyes couldn™t be seen, and I always got 
a kerchief or a hat on my  head so my  br
own hair wouldn™t show. And I remember 
that. 
Yoka
(ph), I was called
 Yoka
(ph), we all had a name, they gave us a name . 
Q: And what was your name? 
A: My name was Œ th-they called me
 Yoka
(ph). 
Q: 
Yoka
(ph). 
A: 
Yoka
(ph), yeah. 
Q: Is that a nickname or a full, normal name? 

A: No, they gave me that name, I mean Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ every child got an Œ got a ha Œ a hiding name.  

Q: Okay . 

A: Especially if they have Jewish sounding Œ 
José 
is not particularly Jewish 
sounding name, but every Œ they  Œ they id
entifal Œ you know, they  Œ they give the 
name. 

Q: Yes. 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
18
A: I remember them very fondly. (Oh, so
rry.) I remember very
 fondly them sitting 
in 
Holland
 Œ you know, you had no central hea
ting, you had like a Œ a st Œ what do 
you c Œ pot belly stove Œ 
Q: A little stove, yeah. 
A: Œ you know. And we would sit around 
it and they  would sing so ngs to me at 
night. And, now you shouldn™t think th erewas anything in  that potbelly stove, they 

had nothing to heat it with, 
but just the illusion, you thi
nk you sit in front of the 
stove, you feel warm. 

Q: It™s warm, yeah. 

A: It™s warm. And I rememb er the singing their songs to me. 
Q: What were their names? 
A: 
Turner Hefferness
(ph). And the beauty  of this, w
hy I tell you this in particular, 
after I moved to 
America
 and I got married, I had 
them come. And when my 
daughter was si Œ what Œ how old was 
she? She was four, my son was six, 
something like that, was the la
st time they were here t
ogether, they would sit with 
my  daughter on their lap and sing th e same 
so ngs they sang to me. So life really  
came full cycle. I remember that, I remember 
being taken to her parents, to my  f Œ f 
Œ I don™t know, to my foster mother™s pa
rents, playing with the children. I have 
pictures of my  playing in the yard with 
them, I remember the 
Œ the Œ the house. All 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
19
those things I do remember. I guess when you
 live Œ and it was very clear that we 
were living under very bad circumstances.
 I mean, the na Œ the word Nazis was Œ 
was used, and Œ 
Q: It was something you reme
mb er being Œ hearing, like Œ 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: Œ like the Nazi is a boogeyman
.  
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You remember it very well, that out
side the house there was danger. And of 
course, there were also a number of close ca
lls. Like I told you before, then the na Œ 
th-the underground would come wh en they
 knew they were staging a raid. A few 
times Œ this is all they told me, this I 
don™t rememb er, of course. One time they had 
no time to get me out, so they had to do a 
little quick thinking and my foster father 
decided he was going to  lay 
in bed and say he was sick
, and th ey would put me on 
the foot end of the bed, and he made believe he was laying with his feet up on the 

pillow, and I was put in the foot end. And 
they  really came in looking at the house, 
and they  didn™t see a child
, and they left again. 
Q: That was a very close call.

A: 
[indecipherable]
 a close call, I could have coughed, cried. I wa
s, you know, by 
that time where I could have been  a year 
old, I don™t know how old I was, I didn™t 
ask him how old I was at that point. But it™
s like a child senses fear, and those went 
to, you know, do wh at™s right, I don™t kn
ow. Another close call was my  foster 
mother™s mother 
[indecipherable]
 that they took me to 
her too so metime. Came for 
a visit one day, and she Œ the undergro
und came and told them, you have 10 

minutes to get out, they ™re very close, get th
e children out. So sh e 
said to my foster 
mother, I™ll take her home, just Œ and sh e sa
ys, and give me her 
dirty laundry, go to  
the laundry. And my foster mother says, wh
y? She says, just Œ I just have a hunch, 
do me a favor, you never know where they
™re looking. Because babies clothes 
meant evidence. So, to satisfy
 her mother, okay, here™s 
the dirty laundry. And off 
we went. They came, is a child here? No, 
no child, they went 
looking th rough the 
house, no child. Can I see your dirty laundr
y, please? If it wasn™t for her instinct I 
probably wouldn™t be sitting 
here talking to you. Th
ose are the things that 
happened . You always have
 to go by your guts.  
Q: Yeah, it™s amazing what th
at instinct can tell people. 
A: Always go by your guts. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Always.

Q: So, aside from Œ aside from 
that memory of going out to
 the fields in the Œ you 
know, in that hay, in th Œ in that sort of
 like cart that someone 
is pushing, what are 
some of the other memories that you have of 
them, of the larger family, of your first 
years. 
A: Getting together. I remember g o ing to 
church, my first religious experience was 
not in a synagogue, was in church.  

Q: Was it a Catholic church , did 
you Œ or was it a Protestant Œ 
A: No, they were Protestant. 

Q: They were Protestant. 

A: They were Protestant, they were Protes
tant. It was very important to know that 
not only were they Protestant, they were 
very devout Protestant, they were very 
religious. And th e reason th ey took me wa
s their Christian duty. They felt it w as 
their Christian duty. So mewher
e in the back  of their minds
, they also figured, well, 
if they don™t come back, they™ll have anot
her Christian child. Th
at was in the back 
of all their mind. Do esn™t bal Œ bother me
, because you know, wh at they did was 

good, the rest doesn™t really 
matter. But it was definitely Œ 
I don™t know if they were 
not such  devout Ch ristians that they would have done it. They  felt it was their 
Christian duty to save a Œ to save a 
Jewish child. It was that motivation.

Q: Do you reme mb er anything about the 
ch urch they would take you to? Any kind 
of thoughts, or Œ 
A: No, no, I just remember wa
lking in  Œ in a building, it was a church and of course 
when you™re a young child ev
erything seems very big. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And there was a children™s choir and 
towards the end of the war I remember 
singing in it. They Œ the little
 Œ there were little kids singing a song. That was my 
first, you know, recollection. 

Q: Mm-hm. Let™s go forward th en . I mean, 
if those are the memo ries that you have, 
you™re sitting around a potbelly
 stove, or you™re Œ or you
™re in the choir, or you™re 
going out to the Œ to  the fields Œ 

A: And walk ing around after dinner, we w
ould take a Œ take a walk, usually, if the 
weather permitted.
 Holland
 doesn™t have such  great weather always, but Œ 
Q: Yeah. So , wh en did Œ wh en di
d things change? 
Wh at h a pp en ed ? 
A: Interesting you should as
k that. For us hidden ch ildren, the wo rst was not during 
the war. Believe it or not, the worst was 
after the war was over. Because specially 
those of us that were born during th e war 
were so young and we
re given as babies, 
we didn™t know our families.
 All we knew is what we 
knew. These are our parents, 
this is our family. And one day, I came hom
e Œ like I said, we Œ I would take a walk

after dinner with my father, the war wa
s over, and something amazing happened. 
The war was over and my mother, of course, 
went to look for survivors, first lo oked 
for her child. And th at same organization 
where she went to place me, she went to 
to find me. And she stated her name and th
e name of her child. 
And they produced a 
neat, nice, little list, an d they
 said, oh your child is there, and there in that address 
[indecipherable]
 
Utrecht
. And I often think to mysel
f, if the Nazis would have 
found those lists, again I wouldn™t be s
itting talking to you. 
But they were so 
organized, they could tell her immediately 
where I was. So, she couldn™t get to me 
right away, because there was no transporta
tion of any kind in Œ 
you had to have, I 
guess, some money, I don™t know what. Bu t, 
after about a couple of month, the next 
month or so, or two months, she came fo
r a visit, she came to see me. And I 
remember going for my evenin
g constitutional with my foster father, and we come 
home, and in the kitchen on a four prong st
ool Œ I™ll Œ never in my  life do I look at a 
four prong stool and not asso
ciate that Œ there™s a lady sitting. And I was raised to 
be a polite little girl, an d I s-stretch ed my 
hand out, and I want to shake her hand. 
And I said, good even ing lady. And just 
like I™m sitting here talking to you, she 
says, you don™t have to call me lady. 
You can call me Mommy . I am your mo ther, 
these are not your parents. When you™re a th
ree year old, your life as you know it at 
that point falls apart. S o , like I said, I ha
d kind of a secure 
little world with people

that I loved and loved me, and there come
s this strange lady, and telling me she™s 
not my  mo th er. What is a three year old supposed to think about that? 
Q: It™s terrifying. 
A: They weren™t psychologically very astute
 in those days. This is not the way you 
tell a child, you know, her whereabouts. An
d life after that was, for us children, 
very traumatic. 
Q: Well, tell me how it was for you. Wh at happened to  you? 
A: M-My mother came for th
e visit, she stayed a little 
bit and she went home. And 
then she would come to visit. And after 
she got away from her foster family and 
established herself in the apartment, wh
ich was Œ the Jews in those days didn™t 
invest their money in  stocks and bonds 
and mu tual funds, there was no th ing in 
those days. And the stock market they didn
™t trust, so if you 
had a little money, you 
bought a house, you bought real estate. 
And those typical European houses, you 
know, were three, four story homes. So 
everybody had real esta te. S o  one house, 
two house, 10 house,
 whatever it was. 
Q: Smart. 

A: And my grandfather had a home in am
ster Œ you know, several houses in 
Amsterdam
, and what my mother did is first 
after she lo oked to establish herself, 
she went into one of her house of her fath
er and took an apartm
ent and went to live

there. So after she came to visit a few tim
es here and there, she took me for a few 
days to stay with her. Now,  also, you have to unders
tand something else. They 
didn't  give me up willingly. My fa Œ foster father and mother made a pact that if the 
war is over and one of my  pa
rents would su rvive or both, they would give me back 
to parents, but to nobody else. So if, 
for instance, my  mo ther would not have 
survived, and my father did 
not survive, and an
 aunt or an uncle or a grandparen t 
would co me back, they  weren™t going to 
return me. And they had the law of the 

land with them, because the Dutch decided th
at it was in the best interest of the 
children not to be uprooted. 
S Œ and a lot of parents ha
d big problems getting their 
children back. And they didn™t 
give me willin gly. They tr
ied to convince my mother 
that maybe it was better I should stay with them. Now, I can Œ 
Q: Do you remember Œ I Œ I™m
 sorry to interrupt here, bu
t do you remember a ny of 
your response after that fi
rst time when she came and 
she said, they™re not your 
parents, I am your mo th er? Did you cry, di
d you ask ab out it when sh e left, did you 
Œ do you rememb er anything of Œ 

A: I was so dumbfounded, I don™t think I cried. I Œ I mu st have just stood there, not 

knowing what to think. What
 do you th ink? What do you mean this is not my  
mother? A child doesn™t understand Œ 
Q: Of course not.

A: Œ the reproductive system. 
A: Of course not. 

A: Wh en  so meb ody  say s call me  mo mmy
, you™re mommy. And they were good to 
me, I had no reason to doubt that
 they were my parents.  
Q: Of course. 

A: They couldn™t be better if they tried, 
they were wonderful people. It™s Œ all of a 
sudden the Œ I mean, I was 
just so stunned and dumb fo unded, but you su re don™t 
know what to think any more. 

Q: Did you think you Œ do 
you think you changed in 
who you were and how you 
acted? Do you think Œ did they  ever tell you,
 your foster parents, that they saw a 
change in you? 

A: No, no, because I think th
ey were all trying to pull th
eir own weight. My mother, 
yes she had lost her whole family, which by
 the way, she didn't  know yet at that 
point, because people didn™t know until a fe
w years after if people had survived the 
war. It wasn™t the computer age, and the 
Red Cross gave you th
e info rmation. And 
people went for years after to look at lists
 at the Red Cross to
 see if anybody had 
survived. So my 
mother was not aware that everyb
ody had been killed. She didn™t 
know yet. But I can imagine, after he
r own source, and he
r own Œ you know, it 
wasn™t easy for her to be in hiding eithe
r, and then you find your child and your

child is a stranger to you a
nd th e child doesn™t want you, and my  mo ther didn't even 
know right away that it was right, and sh
e asked to see that rattle, and if you 
reme mb er in the beginning I told you she 
packed some things. She asked to see if 
they had the suitcase that sh
e pack ed fo r me. And sure enough th ey produced it, and 
she looked to see if I had the birthmark 
on my  thigh and there it was. I don™t have it 
any mo re, but it was, I guess, a sign from 
God to show me who I was. And I can 
imagine how terrible for my mother. I me
an, she would Œ the children that were 
older, that were reunited with their pa
rent, they run to their parent, Mommy, 
Mommy. I didn™t run to my mother, I didn™
t want to go to her. On  the other hand I 
also understand my  foster 
parents, who knew when  th
ey took me, it wasn™t an 
adoption. It was Œ I was given there for sa fekeeping. They knew
 that they weren™t 
supposed to keep me. But I 
can also understand, I have children an d a grandchild 
myself, you get attached to a child, especia
lly when you shelter 
a child against such 
horro r. You don™t want to give the Œ I unders
tand th eir point too, as an adult. As a 
child, I didn™t, of course. So I remember
 it was very tense between my  foster 
parents, especially my foster father and my
 mother. It wasn™t an easy relationship. 

And my  mo ther would have liked nothing be
tter than I would have said to her, oh, I 
don™t want nothing to do with these people, 
I only want to be with you. And I didn™t 
do that. I loved these people dearly, and I™v
e loved them til the end of their days,

and I had th em come here to

 and th ey met my  husband and my  ch ildren. 
And, you know, I did what
ever I could to them. 
Q: It is Œ 
A: It is just such a sad Œ I mean Œ 
Q: It is tragic, and it Œ and requires such 
a sacrifice. You know, as I hear you speak 
and Œ and Œ and point out, you know, th
e heartbreak on a
ll of the sides Œ 
A: All of the sides Œ 
Q: All of the sides. 
A: Œ I mean, it is so unfair, I mean, I can un
derstand it was terrible. It wouldn™t have 
been as bad for my foster pa
rents, even though 
they were very a
ttached to me, of 
course, to give me up, had they  had their 
own children. I guess that made also a bit 
of a difference. But they didn™t. And ma
ny years after the war they told me, no 
matter how bad the war was, having me 
were the best years of their life. 
Q: Oh, how wonderful. 
A: Yeah, imagine that. 
Q: How wonderful.  

A: And I was an adult, I was living in

 already. I have a Œ that™s what they

Q: But you know, there™s also
 something else that Œ in wh at you say that in ma ny 
ways it™s Œ there™s a great deal of joy in  
this. We™re talking this weekend with a lot 
of people who are child survivors, who we
re hidden, and one of the themes that 
comes through in many stories, and a sadn
ess that just doesn™t go away, is the 
abandonment. Children were 
abandoned because they had 
to be, because the parents 
wanted th em to find some way of surviv
ing. And then , afte
r the war, sometimes 
there were relatives who were never inte
rested in pick ing up those abandoned 
children. And in  your case, what you have is
 the opposite of that
, is that everybody 
wanted you. 
A: That, yes. 
Q: And then  Œ and when you th ink deve
lopmentally, what a child needs, every 
single one, a chi Œ 
A: Is to be wanted. 

Q: Is to be wanted. 
A: That, yes. 
Q: And the foundation that that gives Œ 

A: That yes, that yes, that yes. 
Q: Œ for a future life. 

 
Interview with José Coltof

A: But it was very hard fo
r me. I mean, I couldn™t understand why Œ my  mo ther was 
very grateful to them, but you wouldn™t kn
ow it in the way she expressed it. Like Œ 
like I said, there was a jealousy. And I belo
ng to a child survivor group and when  
we sat around and talking ab out it, mo st of us
 that were babies that were born, you 
know, during the war, they all have the sa
me  experience. The Œ the parents really 
would have liked the children to  be estra
nged from the foster parents. But we kids, 
we wouldn™t let. We really Œ I Œ it™s pr
obably a sign of strengt
h on our part, as little 
as we were, I wouldn™t let my mother no
t have contact with them. She would have 
loved it if I would have said, you know wh
at? You™re my mother now, I don™t need 
them any mo re. Oh no, I woul
dn™t let them do that. I wouldn™t let them do that at 
all. 
Q: So, do you rememb er the Œ do you reme
mber the day that you no longer lived 
with them? 

A: No. No, I Œ I Œ I think I probably blocke
d it out, it mu st have been  so traumatic 
for me to leave them, that I 
probably totally blocked it. 
Like there™s certain things 
you block out, and I mu st 
have blocked that out. I don™t reme mb er the day.  
Q: So, do you rememb er Œ do you reme mb er 
how you felt to your mother, your real 
mo ther in the beginning, and how that grew and ch a Œ 
A: I resented her. 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
31
Q: Okay . 
A: I resented her for taking me away from 
them, and it was very difficult to be with 
my  mo ther. She loved me, but she didn™t expr
ess it in a way that I express my  love 
for my  children. Sh e didn't pick me up and hug me a lot, she wasn™t very 

demonstrative. And she loved me cond
itionally, not unconditio
nally. And it went 
something like this, you know, I can take a
ll this love Œ loss of all my family, and 
she really never lost her whole family, if 
you™re only a good girl, if you™re only Œ it 
was very conditional. And I remember, I was married Œ 

Q: It™s a huge burden  on a child. 

A: It™s ridiculous. And I remember Œ I think I was married already and I said to my 
mo ther, you know, what you expect of me 
is ridiculous. You ha
d Œ lo st her whole 
family, as I said. I said , I only know how 
to  be your daughter. I don™t how to be 
your husband, I don™t know how to  be 
your brother, your sister, your brother-in-
law, your sister-in-law, your nieces, your
 nephews. I don™t know Œ I can™t make up 
for all these people. I only know how to be
 your child, that™s it
. And, you know, it™s 
Œ she expects it Œ something 
[indecipherable]
 and wasn™t possible to give to her. 
But never Œ she was Œ she felt all alone, an
d she was all alone. But, I think if she 
would Œ she never gave me a compliment 
for anything, never, never. And it was 

 
Interview with José Coltof

32
very stupid. If she would have
 done that, I would have 
maybe done mo re of what 
she wanted. 
Q: How sad. 
A: Like, she never told me she loved me til she was almo st dying, but she would tell 
other people, oh she™s so wonderful, I love 
her so much. That™s not the way to raise 
a child. So Œ and the insecur
ity by living alone was terrib l
e, as some Œ every child 
worries about what happens if their parent
s die. You know, children are not stupid, 
they hear the plane crashes, cat Œ car crashe
s. What happens if Œ if my  parents die? 
So I didn™t have parents, I had my  mo ther
 alone. And I had, as I said  before, I had 
one surv iving cousin , who moved to 
Los Angeles
, at my mother™s 
assistant
. As a 
matter of fact, after the war, when my  c
ousin came back, my  mo ther stood th ere, 
and I remember her waving her finger at him. 
[tape break] 
Q: Yes, waving her finger. 

A: 
Marg rits
(ph), get out of 
Europe, 
get out of
 Holland
. If you th ink this was a bad 
experience, this was
 kinderspiel 
comp ared to what™s going to  come. Get out. And 
she literally  forced him out of
 Holland.
 And th is lady that you just saw, her parents 
left in 1949, and they also went
, so he had a pla Œ he went to 
Los Angeles.
 When 
my cousin left, I was 1 0  years old. As 
long as he was around, I felt I had a little 

 
Interview with José Coltof

33
moral support, a little something. So, after 
he left, I really felt all alone. Now, my 
mother had remarried after the war. 
Q: Excuse me, let me
 back up ju st a little bit. How 
old were you when you switched 
your families? When you went
 Œ left your first Œ first Œ 
A: Oh, about three and a half. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Yeah, yeah
, yeah, yeah. 
Q: So it was very soo Œ actually 
very soon after the war ended. 
A: Yeah, probably it was about five, six months after that my  mo ther took me full 

time. Before she took me Œ you know, you
 Œ she was smart enough to realize you 
can™t just take me away full 
time. But Œ but it™s a Œ a pr Œ 
yeah, probably about four  
Q: Was that through Œ 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: So Œ so Œ so nevertheless,
 you knew Œ at four or five 
and six, you started having 
other memories, of not living with  the family Œ 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure. 

Q: Œ but living with your mother? 
A: Sure, sure, sure. Sure, sure.

Q: And can you tell me a little bit about t
hose, some of those early memories that 
come like episodes 
in a child™s mind? 
A: We lived, as I said befo
re, in th e house that my  grandfather had owned. And my  
mo ther found so mebody sh e knew from the pa
st, it was a third cousin or something, 
in 
The Hague
, an elderly lady, she would co me to
 visit. I admire
 my  mo th er, sh e 
did try to establish a life for herself. I re
me mber going with her, being in th e house, 

going out with her. My  Œ then  in ™46, my  co
usin came back, he came to visit. They  
tried to live things normal. She tried to 
get some of her Œ the houses back, it was 
very comp licate Œ 

Q: Did she get them? 
A: Some of them, but that™s a whole different
 story. Things were 
kind of Œ I Œ there 
was no nursery school, my  first school expe
rience was five years old. My mo ther 
was smart enough Œ there was 
one Jewish school only in 
Holland
, an d  my  mo th er, 
thank God, was smart enough to  send me to
 that, and I say smart enough, because 

all of us children had gone through the wa
r, be it in concentration camp , hiding, so 
we became like a family. I 
had very close friends 
[indecipherable]
. I remember my 
fort Œ first 
Simkhes Torah 
in Œ when sh
e took me Œ 
Q: You must tell me w h at these are. 
A: Oh, 
Simkhes Torah
 is Œ is Œ is a holiday.

35
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And after 
Rosh Hashanah, 
the last holiday, we have 
a month long of holiday s, 
and the last holiday is 
Simkhes Torah
, and there was Œ one of the ceremonies at
 
Simkhes Torah
 in the synagogue is that you 
take all the children on the 
retalli
(ph) 
and you bless the children. And one of my  fi
rst memories as I went to shul with my 

mother, to the synagogue and they called up 
the children to bless 
the children, and I 
remember all the adults around, everybody
 was crying, the tear Œ crying, and I 
couldn™t figure out what they™re crying. Of
 course, now I know why. This was the 
remnant, these were the children that ha
d su rvived the war, here they were. And 
every time I see them do 
that in synagogue on 
Simkhes
 
Torah
, I think back of that 
first time. You ne Œ 
you Œ certain things just stay 
with you. You never forget.  
Q: This ma y sou Œ sound like a strange ques
tion, but it™s born out of that experience 
that you described. You were with thesefoster parents, whom you loved, with  

whom you felt secure, who we
re Christian, who took y
ou to  church. Wh en did you 
start fe eling Jewish? 

A: Wh en  my  mo th er too k  me 
in, she took me to synago
gue. I don™t know if the 
word  Jewish meant something, or Protestant, but it was different. 
Q: Did you feel at home 
there in  that synagogue? 

 
Interview with José Coltof

A: Yeah, it was my mother. It didn™t bother me. As a matter of fact, I often think 
about if my mother wouldn™t
 have come back, and I wo uld have stayed with them, 

if they wo uldn™t have told me I would have
 been a Jewish child, whatever, figured it 
out. I think I would have. 

Q: Why? 

A: I guess I looked different
 than them. I-I look Œ I have
 very Semitic looks, and I 
think I would have figured it out. I think th
ere™s a certain Œ I think there™s a certain 
warmth to synagogue, and a certain coldne
ss to church. I think I would have figured 
it out. But I wonder. 

Q: I was Œ I was after something like that
, because at some point a person starts 
identifying themselv
es. They find Œ 

A: I was Œ I was very comfortable in synago
gue, I was very comfortable in a Jewish 
Œ not knowing the difference between Ch ris
tian and Jewish. You don™t know, when 
you™re that young a child. 
Q: No, no, no. 
A: I was very comfortable with it, and 
we went to school, our first school 

experience was when we were five years ol
d, kindergarten, and it was very Jewish 
and I was very comfortable in it. That I ne
ver wanted to  go back
 for, I never said I

want to go to church. It™s 
interesting th at you bring th
at up, because I never, ever 
said I would like to go to church.  
Q: Well, see, what I™m trying to do Œ 
A: I would love Œ I always loved seeing my  
foster parents, that I always was happy 
to go, but I never oncein my life uttered the phrase, I™d 
like to go to church  again. 
Isn™t that interesting? 

Q: Well, one of the reasons where it become
s a question to  me is
 because you Œ you 
drew a picture of Œ of warm foster pa
rents and a Œ and a relationship with your 
mother that was fraught with cer
tain tensions and anxieties Œ 
A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Œ that wasn™t easy. 
A: Very difficult. 

Q: So Œ so th at, if you go from a place that
 was warm, to a place that has problems, 
and yet today you are someone
 who is very  Jewish Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and you Œ okay, something else mu st 
have brought you there. That™s wh at I™m 
trying to  Œ 
A: Well, first of all, my mother ca
me from a very relig
ious background. 
Q: Okay .

A: And she continued th at, contrary  to so
me other people that came through the war 
and threw everything away. No
w, again, my mother was 
hidden, she was spared the 
tragedy of the camps. People Œ although th
ings weren™t easy, but people were civil 
to her and decent to her. And 
people that went through the camps saw, of course, 
such cruelty that thank God,
 my mother was spared from.
 And, like my  cousin, who 
believes in nothing any mo re, says, where 
was God when  we need ed  him? And I la 
Œ and my  cousin  questioned my  mo ther, 
Tante
, why are you still religious? And my 
mother answered him, so if I™m n o t, wo
uld life be better? At least she felt it w as 
something to hold on
to, because she was brought up in  that home. And it gave her a 
s Œ it gave her life and it did me the same. 
I went, as I said, to
 the only Jewish 
school in 
Amsterdam
, there™s only one Jewish elementa
ry school to this day, it™s 
called 
Rosh  Pina
, and the high school is now called 
Maimonides
, I went there. 
And I™m very grateful my  mo ther didn™t
 send me to public school because I hear 

when  I sit in our groups, kids that went Œ 
were sent to public 
school, they stood out, 
they were different. Even though th-the Œ 
the Christian children had als Œ you know, 
also had gone through a war, 
but a totally different experience. They were with their 

parents, they weren™t separated from th
eir families. It w as a whole different 
experience. And they  felt strange, and they  
felt out of place, where even though we 

didn't  talk about our experience, but we 
all went through the same. And on vacation

time, when people said, what are you doin
g on vaca Œ oh, I™m going to my  foster 
parents, I™m going to my foster parents. 
And we had very close bonds, and I™m very 
grateful for that, that was one of the best  things my mother 
ever did, because I 
didn™t have a family. So Œ 
Q: It became something like that. 

A: It became Œ absolutely. 

Q: Another question. You know 
your story before you are conscious of it, that is 
you know of her story,
 you know of sh Œ so at some 
point she started talking to  you, 
she started telling you. 

A: She did. She fa Œ she talks Œ very in
teresting, she talked a lot about her own 
family, very little about my father. And no
t too lo ng, not too many years before she 
died, I said to her once, I 
said, you know, I™d like to kno
w a little about my father™s 
family. You never talk about him, tell me 
so mething about my father. She said, he 
was a very good man, he wo
rked  very hard, at night he
 was tired and he went to 
sleep after he ate. But she was very instru
mental in giving me a very vivid picture 
of her life with her parents, with her two 
brothers and sisters, what that was like. 

That she Œ she talked 
about a lot. That was important to her.  
Q: It Œ it™s also, in a totally different c
ontex t, but I rememb er as a journalist I once 

interviewed someone who was a victim of torture in 
South America
 and had ended

up in 
Denmark
 in a rehabilitation center. And he
 didn't want to tell his children 
about what he had gone th
rough. And through his work 
in this rehabilitation center, 
he found out that that was a mistake. That
 wh en he kept that from him Œ from them, 
they could not get as close to
 him as they wanted to be. 
And when  he started talking 
to them about his life, his Œ 
you know, the difficult parts, 
but wh en he started really 
saying, this is what my life was made up
 of, it changed the dynamics. And Œ and so, 
it sounds that Œ that it was a cau Œ she 
Œ she was a complicated, amazing woman, 
your mo ther. 
A: But ag Œ but again, she 
was hidden, and I find that th
e people that were hidden, 
talked about their experience much easier th
an the ones in the concentra Œ I Œ that Œ 
that hell was much hard
er to talk about. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: And I think that™s Œ 

Q: For understandable reasons. 
A: Of course. My only cousin, wh
o I saw a couple of years ago in 
Los Angeles
, and 
I said to him, I said, you know, I 
know you don™t want to do the 
Spielberg
 thing, 
but I begged him to do the 
Spielberg
 thing, or what you ar
e doing, and he wouldn™t 
do it. I said, for my own personal collecti
on, would you Œ and fo
r the tape recorder, 
would talk with him a little b
it? O k ay, so he sat down, he
 talked some basic fact. 

 
Interview with José Coltof

But wh en  it came to anything real, he just got
 tears in eyes, he said, I don™t want to 
talk about it. After all these years. You 
mention th e name of his siblings and he 
starts to cry. After 
all these years. SoŒ 
Q: Oh, it™s horrible. Because it™s Œ it™
s Œ it™s ir Œ an irrevocable loss. 
A: It™s an irrevocable, but again I Œ I cred it my foster parents with making the Œ I 

have a lot of friends that are in therapy, 
and this and that, and I think the love that 
they were able to give me, 
in these very early month and 
years of my life, they very, 
very important foundation. I™m not in th
erapy. My kids wo
uld probably say you 
beli-long in therapy, but that™s another story. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: But Œ Ma, you crazy, but that™s a differe
nt story. But I function better, I think, 
than a Œ than a lot of othe
r, beca Œ because it™s different
 where you p-pa Œ when you 
schlep from home to home, as many of my  
friends have. They went from place to 
place, and so in the end wound up even 
in the camps, after being in hiding. 
Q: Oh, my. 

A: Oh yeah, a lot of the kids went in a hiding place Œ 

Q: So they were caught? 
A: Yeah, of course. Of course. So, with ev
erything, I consider my self pretty lucky. 
Q: Tell me a little bit more
 about your life after th
e school, and when  you Œ 

 
Interview with José Coltof 
 
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
42
A: Oh, okay, okay. 
Q: Œ married, came to the 
United States
 and so on. 
A: Okay. As I told you 
before, my mother was obsessed with getting out of 
Euro pe. 
The obsession never stopped. Sh
e told my cousin 
to go, and he liste
ned, and as soon 
as the war was over and things started to 
normalize a little, my mother still wanted 
to get out of what Œ of 
Euro pe
. What happened, she met a 
man in the late 40s, pr-
probably  ™48 - ™49, an d they
 wanted to get married. They  couldn™t get married right 
away because I™m sure you
™re familiar with the fact
 that you needed  death 
certificates, and the only ones to provide th
em were the Red Cross. So she needed a 
death certificate that her husba
nd had died, and he needed 
the death certif Œ he was 
a man, a German Jew, he n
eeded the death certificate th
at his wife had died. And it 
took a couple of years, so
 they finally got married in  1951. And so he was in 
Bergen-Belsen
 in the camps, and it didn™t do any good to his health. And 
eventually, he had a heart condition, after th
ree years he died. So
 in 1954 he died. 
S o  my  mo th er was Œ 

Q: Do you have me
mories of him? 

A: Very unpleasant memories. H e was very
 resentful of me, because he had an 18 
year old daughter that died, and my  mo the
r™s daughter lived. So he tolerated me. He 
wasn™t bad to me, but he wasn™t any go
od, and I was a little child when they 

 
Interview with José Coltof

married. So, you know, it would have been ni
ce to have somebody that is nice to 
you Œ 
Q: Is warm. 
A: Œ and warm and kind. He tolerated me
. H e wanted my moth
er, I was the child, 
he couldn™t very well say to my mother, ge
t rid of the child. That she wouldn™t have 
done. So  I was tolerated, and I Œ I knew it.
 And it got to the po
int that I felt so 
unwanted  that I was trying to think to my se
lf, I want to get out of here. I don™t Œ if 
my mother wants to be with 
this man, that™s her story, 
but I want to get out. And I 
actually hatched a plot how to 
get out. I had heard about youth 
aliyah
 and kids 
going to 
Israel 
at that point, and I said, you know
 what? Maybe I can
 go to youth 
aliyah
, and I heard about kibbutzim. I said, 
you know, my  Œ let me see, maybe I 
could go on my  own to a kibbutz and live th ere. I don™t want to be with this man 
any more. But that™s up to my
 mother what she want. And I hate to say it, but when  
he died, I wasn™t very unhappy. And, so 
then, after he died, my mother went again 
for her papers, and 
HIAS
 helped people with papers, 
and we went to Œ 1955 to 
America
 fo r three months. 
Q: 
HIAS
 being the Hebrew Œ 
A: Yeah, aid society, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Okay .

A: And we came, we got an affidavit thro
ugh our friends. This 
lady th at you just 
saw, her parents gave us the affidav
it, and we went for three months to 
America
. 
And in those days you had 
to go every two years to
 America
, otherw ise you lost 
your a Œ your Œ your papers
. So, we traveled back and 
forth, my mother had still 
things to do in 
Holland
. And wh en Œ and we lived fo r one year in 
Los Angeles,
 we 
went for one year to
 L.A.
 And then we went back, I fi
nished my  school. My  mo ther 
wanted me to finish high school, so fine, 
I did. And then in ™62 I came perman ently. 
And I met my  husband, let™s see, in 19 Œ ye
ah, December ™65, an
d in February ™65 Œ 
™66 we got married. And I have a daughter a
nd a son, and they were born in ™71 and 
™74. 
Q: And your husband was an American, or Œ 
A: Very interesting. I met my husband th
rough mutual Dutch friends. As I said to 
you wh en  you were talking befo re Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ how come you stayed in, people didn
™t get out, as I said, only people with 
money and connections got ou
t. My in-laws lived in 
Rotterdam.
 Both my families, 
my  Œ my  family on my side know th
at they go back hundreds of years in
 Holland
, 
and my  husband™s side also. We™re not Du
tch, you know, for one generation that 
came from 
Poland
, or what. We™re as Dutch, re
al Dutch Jews. My husband™s

family, as I said, lived in
 Rotterdam
. My father-in-law was a physician, my 
mother-in-law for her day wa
s extraordinary well educat
ed. She Œ wo men in those 
days were educated when th
ey finished elementary scho
ol, very well educated if 
they finished  high school, and ex ceptional 
to go to the univers
ity. My mother-in-law 
went to the University of 
Leiden, 
my Œ to study law. My father-in-law went to 
study medicine, they met at the university
, they got married. My
 f Œ mother-in-law 
actually practiced law in those days, in th
e 30s and all that. And my  father-in-law 
had a practice in 
Rotterdam.
 And they had connections. My f Œ mother-in-law™s 
family was in the scrap metal business, a
nd there was somebody that they knew that 
got a group together. And they
 said, if you can get 50,0 00 
guilders
, which is like a 
half a million today, or mo re, you can get out. And he had a group and all Œ every 
couple have to pay 50,000 
guilders
 to get out. And my  father and mo ther-in-law 
described a scene where they went to this
 Nazi™s place, and th e mo ney was piled up 
on tables to the ceiling, practically. And th
ey  did manage to escape. Their flights Œ 
Steven Spielberg
 could make a movie of th e 
story how th ey got out, via
 Holland, 
Belgium, France
, finally
 Spain.
 When they were in 
Spain,
 I think for a cou-couple 
of months, and then  th
ey finally wound up in
 Cuba
 and then to 
Holland. 
Q: To the 
United States. 

 
Interview with José Coltof

A: To the 
United States,
 I™m sorry. My father-in-law had to get again his license to 
study medi Œ to practice medicine in 
America
. After he had got that and then they 
moved to  
Queens. 
And th ere was a Dutch family a
nd they heard, oh, there is a 
Dutch doctor in town, let™s go to him. An
d from being doctor patient relationship, 
developed a very wo nderful friendship. I 
knew that family, th
ey know me, they 
know my husband and 
they put us together. So  even  though we Œ my husband was 
raising his second Œ that ship 
that they went to, went to  
Havana
, and th en they  
came to 
America
, so his second birthday was in
 Havana.
 And I married a 
Dutchman here in 
America. 
Q: Wow, wow. 
A: Yeah, as he is fond of saying, she is from 
Amsterdam
, I am fro m 
Rotterdam
, 
and together we have a damn  good time. 
[laughter]. 
That™s Œ that™s his quote. Bu t 
yes, I did marry a Dutchman, and we do
 speak Du tch at home and my  children 
understand Dutch and speak it also. 

Q: How interesting, how inte
resting. And you now live in
 Los Angeles

Los Angeles,

A: Because my friend is from th

Los Angeles, 
yes. 
Q: That™s right, that™s right, that™s right. 
A: And my first, when we went to 
America
 the first time, we stayed in 
Lo s 
Angeles
 for Œ for three months, and we lived in
 Los Angeles 
for a year. 
Q: And tell me a little bit ab
out how you maintained co
ntact with your foster 
family. You know, how you forced y
our mother to do so, and how Œ 
A: Oh Œ 
Q: Œ and how you maintained that contact then? 
A: Well, in those days, you 
know, there was no email, it was snail mail, so we wrote 
letters to each other. Later on Œ 
the telephone was a luxury in 
Holland
, you know, 
in the early years, so they 
Œ they got the tele Œ yeah, te
lephone, we would have, you 
know, phone calls back and fo
rth, but mostly letters. I 
mean, people were big in 
writing letters.

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, my  mo ther would Œ so metimes she wo
uld let me stay with
 them a little bit, 
an overnight or somethin
g. No t mu ch, we usually would go for the day. 

Q: I see. 

A: I-I don™t know if she was fearful of Œ th
at they wouldn™t give me back again, I 
don™t know what was it a ma Œ mostly we we
nt, spent the day. And they came to me 
to spend the day, they came for 
a visit. It was mostly visits. 
Q: I see. A nd then when you became an 
adult, did your ties 
in somehow or other 
change? 
A: Well, I was in 
America
, so that was oh Œ you know, 
I came to here when I was 
20 years old. And I always co
rresponded. When I came to 
Holland
 for a visit, of 
course, I went to see them. But I had them come to
 America
. They came together 
twice as a couple, and then
 my  Œ so, they had the pl
easure of seeing my  children 
and my  husband. And of course
 it™s nice that my  husband
™s also Dutch, so they 
could communicate, because they didn™t sp
eak a word  of English. And after my  
foster pa Œ father died, she came o n ce 
alone. And so my  neig
hbors, my  friends 
around where I live now, actually met my fost
er parents, which was very interesting 
for them. And my daughter

remember them, but my daughter remember
s them, and like I said, it was really 
something for me to hear 
them sing. They  brought du
 Œ books with
 Dutch songs, 
and they  were sitting now singing to my  ch
ildren the songs they s
ung to me. I really 
came full cir Œ full circle. 
Q: Very warm Œ a very warm thou

A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, 
yeah, yeah , yeah.  
Q: Is there anything else you™d like to a
dd to what you™ve told, that you think is 
important for people to know? 

A: Ah, yes, I think it™s very important to 
know that as mu ch as I have a good life, 
and I™m very grateful fo r the life I have, 
it never leaves you. Like I said, I don™t 
know if I said it to you, when I go to we
ddings, or Bar Mitzvahs or places, and I see 
the people go in to a family picture. And th
e picture, the le Œ wide angle lens isn™t 
wide enough, they fi Œ ho-how to fit ev
erybody in. And, you 
don™t need a wide

pt for my  husband, my  children and my one 
cousin, an d he is ac Œ older already, he wa
s born in 1924, there 
is no family. And no

Q: How long was your mother with you? 
A: A long time, thank God, she lived
 a long life. She died in 1998. 

Q: Oh. 
A: She was almo st 92 years old. So  she 
saw my children into 
adulthood. I™m sorry 
she didn™t see my  daughter get ma rried, but
 she did have that Œ and she was Œ like 
it™s funny, like you say what else can you ad
d? As I told you, I Œ her love for me 
was very conditional, but my Œ her love fo
r my Œ my children wa
s totally unc Œ she 
adored  them. And I often say, you know, 
kids, you couldn™t do 
any wrong, and Œ I 
couldn™t do any good, but you couldn™t do 
anything wrong. And 
it was really, you 
know, I™m glad she lived to 
see my children, because sh
e really, she adored them, 
and they  Œ they knew it. 

Q: And it also is in a way trying to give 
you back wh at she couldn™t have given you 
directly, by loving your
 children, whom you Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ love, you know, it Œ 
A: Also something funny, and I wonder if 
other people feel that way. When I was 
raising my  own children, you ju st do what
 you do. You™re bus
y, yo-you Œ yo-you Œ 
you Œ you go, you cha
nge diapers, you make food, you shop, you dress, you bring 
them to school, wh atever it is you do. And 
I did that. I never stopped to think of

anything else. Now that I have a grandc
hild, it hits home even
 mo re in  a way ,  
because she comes and she goes
. I look at this little child and I say, how could these 
bastards have hurt a little child like that
? I look at this little girl, sh e™s now three 
years old. Some of these little 
children were left all alone
 in the world, looking for 
somebody to hold their hand, to take care
 of them. How could these bastards, and 
how can we ever ask to forgive this? Neve
r. When my granddaugh
ter turned four Œ 
my  daughter knows my whole story, I Œ you
 know, I™ve never be
en not op
en about 
it. And when  she turn ed four months
 old, I said to Œ her name is 
Yerwousha
(ph), I 
said, 
Yerwousha
(ph), would you imagin
e your having to give this little girl, 
somebody coming to your door and so mebo
dy taking this child from you? You 
never know if you will ever see her again. Th
en she broke out in tears. As much as 
she knows my  story and m-my  foster parent
s, now that she™s a mother herself, sh e 
understands really how it hits home. 

Q: And what price was paid. 
A: And what price was paid. And like I said
, it hit. And now I see this child, I say, 
how could th ey hurt a ch
ild? Ho w can you do it? Ho
w can any human being do 
this? It Œ it hits me in a wa
y even  mo re now, because I ta
ke distance. It never leaves 
you. It never leaves you. As mu ch as I 
function and I, you know, do everything I™m 
supposed to do, I-I think, it never leaves 
you. It will go with you to your grave.
