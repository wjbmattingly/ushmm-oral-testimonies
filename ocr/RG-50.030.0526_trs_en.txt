ZYGMUND SHIPPER 
 May 27, 2008 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Mr. Shipper. 
Answer: Good morning to you. 

Q: Thank you very much for agreeing 
to be interviewed with us today. 
A: Now, it™s a -- it™s my pleasure and it™s an hono
r to come  to the United St ates, you know, to be 
interviewed. So, I™m onl y too pleased to be here. 

Q: We ll, we™re glad to have you. Tell me  if 
you would your -- the name  you were born with and 
what town you were born in. 

A: I -- my name is -- originally was Zygm
und Shipper. Now it is Zi ggy Shipper, you know, 
because in England Zygmund would have been
 a problem, you know, with pronunciation and -- 
but it was -- it™s Shipper now and 
it was Shipper originally, excep
t the spelling was different, it 
was S-zed-y-p-e-r and now it™s S-h-i- double p -e-r.
 The reason, my wife 
decided when we got 
ma rried, because when we had children they ha
d problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, is it 
Zipper?  So we thought the best th
ing is that we change the spel
ling, and we did. Now, I was born 
in a city, second biggest city in Poland, called 
Lódz, L-o-d-zed, and that™s
 where I lived til I was 
deported from Lódz. 

Q: And you were born in 1930, is that correct? 

A: I was born, yes, 18
th
 of January, 1930. 
Q: And tell me a little about your parents. 

A: Well, unfortunately my pare
nts, you know -- I come  from a 
very Orthodox fa mily, Jewish 
Orthodox family and my  parents we
re divorced and my mother left
 me  with my father and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
2 
 
grandparents. And with a Jewish family in th
e 1930™s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or 
even worse, you know. It was such a terrible thin
g for a Jewish fa mily, you know. So as far as I 
knew, you know, after awhile, you k
now, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn™t see my 
mother and that was it. So I was just left with 
my grandparents, of course, and my father, which 
my father worked, so I didn™t see that much of 
hi m either. But my grandmother, as far as I can 
reme mber, she was a wonderful woma n and I owe her 
so much that I wish I could have told her 
that when I grew up, but unfortuna
tely there was no chance of that. 
Q: Yeah. Would you like to tell 
me  your grandparents™ name s and where they were from?  
A: My grandfather was Itzhak Szypers, he wa
s from Lódz. My grandmother came  from a place 

called Zdu

ska Wola, and her name  was Esther Berger, 
before she has a ma  -- her maiden name , 
before she got ma rried. I had -- she had six children. Unfortunately, two of my aunts died well 

before the wa r. One aunt was left and I also -- my  father had two brothers, which were in the -- 

with me all the -- well, not with me, but th
ey were -- they were
 in the -- in Lódz. 
Q: Mm-hm, so you had an extended fa mily -- 

A: I had an extended family, yes, and my fath
er and one of my uncles and my grandfather 
worked in the same  business, they had their 
own business in -- import business of chemical 

ma terials. And the other uncle was an engineer
, he had his own business, you know, he worked. 
So in a way, I think, from what I know now that
 we had a -- a reasonab
le comfortable life, you 
know, I -- I reme mber having enou -- my own be
droom, which is almost unheard. But I suppose 
because we lived in a bi g city, it was a second -- 
as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you 
know, there was a million inhabitants before th
e war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish 
people. I went to a Jewish school, you know, I -- 
it wasn™t a cheder or a Orthodox school, it was 
a Jewish school, but we learned He
brew much more so than -- we 
didn't learn the Bible or things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
3 
 
like that. Hebrew we learned and -- and all the 
other things that childr
en of six, seven, eight 
learn, you know, it was -- it was almost a normal lif
e I had. I don™t -- after 
awhile I don™t think I 
mi ssed that I haven™t got my mother, you know
, really. I was -- maybe I was too young too, 
because my grandmother was -- was a -- certainly a very good substitute for a mother, you know. 
Q: Wa s your grandfather working when you were small, too? 

A: Yes. He was in the business with my -- where 
my father was there, a
nd my uncle, the three of 
them worke d in the business, you know. 

Q: What was the name  of the business, do you know?   

A: Szyper and sin, you know. Father and son, the na
me  of the father and 
just son, it™s like it 
would be here Berger and sons, limited, that company. 

Q: Mm-hm. They were importing ch
emicals for -- do you know what -- 
A: Yes, soda and those big bottles of -- of di
ffer e nt acids and things
 like that, you know?   
Q: Hm. 
A: All I remember, my father had to wear 
goggles and gloves, you know, to protect, because it 
was comi ng on trains, you know, the -- their pl
ace was on a railway sidings. So they -- 
Q: They had a warehouse? 
A: Oh yes, a very big warehouse, you 
know, and that™s what I can reme mb er.  

Q: Right. And your school was all Jewish children? 

A: All Jewish children, the school I went to. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: And did you like school, were you happy in school?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
4 
 
A: As far as I reme mber, yes, you know, I -- I -- 
I wa -- there was no choice anyway and at -- I 
think so. I -- you know, it™s going back 70 year
s. I should imagine that I did like school. 
Q: And -- and you were born in 1930, so yougrew up throughout the 1930™s in Poland. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Any -- anything rema rkable that you reme mb
e r  in those early years before 1939 about your 
life, or was it just -- 

A: N-No, I mean -- I didn™t come  across -- you see, 
that™s -- the thing was that the school was in 
the same  building at -- where we lived, you see?
 It was a small school 
and so I didn™t come  
across anti-Se mitism as much as othe r children that
 had to go in the st reet in sc hool and non-Jew, 
you know, Polish kids, so -- and they used to throw stones at them, and so on and call them 

name s and there were always fights. I guess I wasn™t
 out that much, only play
ed in the yard with 
other children, even with
 Poles. Course, lots of times, you know, there were anti-Semitic 
remarks, but there -- it didn™t mean that much to
 me , I didn™t quite understand what it me ant, you 
know, why are they calling me  dirty Jew, or so
mething like that. You see, which they did, you 
know, in Polish. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But it -- it -- I had no problems about, 
you know, possibly, you know, when you™re six, seven, 
eight years old, I don™t think any child has problems,
 they just fight. If it wouldn™t be with them, 
most probabl y they would have fought amongst each
 other, you know, whether were they Jewish 
kids or non-Jewish kids. 

Q: Yeah. Did you ever travel anywhere? 

A: Ah, no. I have -- the only place we went, we
 -- we traveled to a place called Columnow, 
which was sort of a s -- not a seaside because we
 weren™t on the sea. You know, there wa -- there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
5 
 
was a lake and you know, and I remember going 
swimming, you know, we went away, sort of. I 
don™t know what month it was, whether it was July 
or August, because Poland gets very cold in 
the winter, but very hot in the summe r , you know
, and I reme mber going there as a child and 
having a good time, you know?  I -- on the whole,
 I think I had a good life, you know, til 19 -- til 
September 1939, you know. 
Q: Did you live in a part of town whe r e there were mostly Jews then? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: No, I lived in a -- in one of the ma in st
 -- roads in -- in Lódz, you know, it™s funny enough, I 
went to visit it first time  I went back to Pola
nd. And even -- it was a nice apartment and i -- ik -- 
we even had a -- we lived on a second floor, we
 -- as I said, we  -- I had my own bedroom, you 
know, and we had a balcony, you know, and -- you 
know, even when I showed it to my 
daughters when I went back to Poland, I couldn't believe  it, you know, I mean, because, you 
know, everybody -- well, not everybody, most people 
I s -- in England, a
nd I don™t know how it 
is in the U.S. think that ever
ybody lived like ﬁFiddler on the Roofﬂ 
in a little shtetl. It wasn't , you 
know. Wa rsaw, Kraków, Lódz, you know, they were 
big cities, and you know 
there were -- there 
were poor areas, naturally, and there 
were sort of not so much affl
uent areas. But there were the 
areas, you know, which all apartments. There was 
no small houses or some thing like that, that 
was all apartments. But I mean, you know, it -- it 
is just unbelievable. Wh en I tell my friends, 
they don™t even want to belie
ve that we had a telephone. 
Q: Really? 
A: You see, I-I™m -- not that I spoke on the te
lephone, I™m sure I wouldn™t know how to dial it 
even, you know, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
6 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So it was -- it -- it -- as I sa
id, I think it -- we had a good life,
 as I had a good life as a child. 
Q: Right. 

A: Had wonderful gr -- well, pa
rents almost, they weren™t parent
s, but grandparents. As I said, 
my father I didn™t see that much, you know, becau
se he worked all da y and I suppose he had his 
own life to lead. But he knew that he left me  
with good -- and so I s-suppose my mother must 

have known that she is le
aving me  wi th -- you know. 
Q: Did your mother ever come  back to visit? 

A: My mother came back once, and I still reme
mber that. I don™t know whether I was six years 
old, five years old, you know, don™t know exac
tly. And I c -- I wouldn™t go to her and I 
screamed. I even hit her or scratched her or so
me thing like that. I -- I 
just -- I don™t know why. 
You know, today I think bac
k, why did I do it, I -- 
Q: Did you know who s he was, or did -- 
A: No. 
Q: You didn™t know. 

A: I didn™t know who she was, but she says I™
m your mother and ma ybe that™s what -- you know, 
ma ybe I thought how could you be my mother if 
my mother is dead, you know, and so on. I -- 
you know, I tried to analyze it -- I did years ago 
to analyze it, which you can™t, you know, but no, 
I wasn't  happy to see her and when she left I di
dn™t -- didn™t mean anything to me , I me an, she 
left and I think that™s it, I™ll never see her again, and -- 

Q: Did you know -- was there -- do you know 
why she left?  Did you ever hear -- 
A: No. It™s -- it™s one of my regrets, you know
, that I never knew why she left, you know?  I -- 
look, when you sort of -- especially when 
you grow up and you™re 13 - 14 and you see other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
7 
 
people with mothers and fathers, you know, a
nd -- and you think to yourself, how could she 
leave me ?  But of course you get older and you rea
lize things are not that
 simple, you know, that 
there must have been a good reason why she left.  
Q: We ll tell me  now about the late 30™s and --
 and how did you notice thi
ngs starting to change 
in your life? 

A: We ll, in -- in about 19 -- I would say 1938 th
ere was a lot of talk about war. You know, eight 
year old boy, I mean, what did 
I know about war?  I didn™t even 
mean -- didn™t realize what it 
means there™s a war. And they said, you know, Ge
rmany and the Germans will come in and they 
-- I [indecipherable] and this was carry on lik
e that til 1939, you know, 
and then 1939, you know, 
in September ™39, one morning I was in bed, you know, 
my father came to me and he said he has 
to go away. And I said, why are you going away, 
you know? So I says -- I thought to myself, 
now here a mother I haven™t got,
 now I won™t even have a father. Oh no, he says, don™t worry at 
all, I™ll be back within six m
onths because there™s going to be a war and the German armi es are 
going to invade Poland and the first thing they
 will do is take all th
e young me n away, you know, 
but you and your grandmother and gr
andfather and the children a -- they will -- won™t touc h 
them, it™s only the young people. Of course, hecouldn™t have been more wrong, but nevertheless 

he left and I never saw my father again. He 
run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in 
Russia were not that good either b
ecause at that time the Russians 
already were together with the 
Germans, they split up Poland in half, you know, so
me  part went to Russia and so on. So he 
decided to come back, and he managed to getto Warsaw, because Wa rsaw was by then -- the 

whole of Poland was already occupied by the Ge
rmans or by the Russians. But Wa rsaw was a 
occupied part of Poland by the Germans. Lódz wa
s part of Germany, they annexed it. That™s the 
Third Reich. So he couldn™t get back to us, you 
see?  But that™s what I had found out, later. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
8 
 
™39 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German ar mi es came in and 
things completely changed straight away. 

Q: Do you reme mber that, when -- 

A: Oh yes. I reme mber certain things, not ev
erything. I-I -- I hadn™t seen it, but everybody was 
talking about it, first of 
all, as soon as they came in they de
stroyed most of the synagogues in -- 
in -- in Poland, in Lódz especia
lly, you know. And -- and you know, to
 -- to a -- to a child, even 
nine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox fa mily, you know, to destroy 

a synagogue is -- is the most terr
ible thing that could happen. Bu
t of course everything changed, 
you know. We -- we weren™t allowed to travel on 
normal transport like on trams. We had trams 
in Lódz, we couldn™t travel on trams . I found 
out because I ne ver traveled on trains, you know, 
but you couldn™t travel on a train. Jewish doctors
 couldn™t practice me dicine, Jewish teachers 
couldn™t go to school. And of course, there was 
no school, you know. I left school when I was -- 
in June. That™s where they had 
stopped it in -- in Po
land at the time and I was about nine and a 
half years old, and I never went back to school. 
That was my education in life. And every day 
different things happened. I mean, ya -- you know, 
we couldn™t -- we weren™t allowed to walk -- 
not that people came out of [indecipherable] they
 were too frightened 
to come  out, but you know 
you™ve got to eat, you™ve got to
 buy food. And food was scarce be
cause Jewish shops weren™t 
opened, they closed them up. We  weren™t even a
llowed to walk on paveme nts, you know. But of 
course children like my age, you know, we got aw
ay with it, we walked. But the thing was, you 
know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish ma n, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he 

was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people 
that were Orthodox, especi
ally in -- in Lódz. 
They used to -- first thing they
 did, you know, took out the beard 
off and I -- and I asked why are 
they doing, you know, I didn™t ask the Germans, I 
asked my grandmother, why do they do that?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
9 
 
They said, purely to humiliate hi m, you know, because they know it™s the most terrible thing to 
have that beard cut off. And then they ma de him 
wash the paveme nt, for no reason at all, just to 
degrade hi m, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you™re not even 10 years old, you cannot 

understand why and you keep asking question and 
there is like always, there™s -- there™s no 
answers why. 

Q: Did anything like that happen specifically to your grandfather? 

A: No. My grandfather didn™t go out, you see, 
and he was at home  a
nd food was very, very 
scarce and he  was getting weaker and weaker and 
-- and -- because he wouldn™t eat that food that 
wasn™t kosher and kosher food was almost i mpo
ssible to get. So he lived on bread an-and 
potatoes and things like that, you 
could still get some . But it was 
getting more and more difficult 
and then they decided, you know, 
to recognize every Jew that is 
not recognizable, we have to 
wear a Star of David and in -- in some  places, like
 in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in 

the front. We had to wear one in 
the front and the back so that 
the mi nute th-they saw you they -- 
they knew who you were, so you get beaten up, esp
ecially the older peop
le, not -- you know, and 
the children started stealing food whe r ev
er they could, you know, to bring home . 

Q: Did you do that? 

A: Oh yes.  

Q: Wa s your grandmother then going out
 to get food or try to find food -- 
A: Yes, when she -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- had to, I -- there was no choice. 

Q: And would you with her when you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
10 
 
A: I don™t reme mber me ever 
going with her, you know, but we were out, you know. When I say 
stealing food, there was a lot of tr
ees with apples and pears and 
plums and things like that, you 
know, whatever there was at that time of the year. You know, we used to 
go and st-steal and we 
used to get beaten up, but you know, but when you s 
-- nine, 10 years old, it™
s -- it™s a game more 
than anything else, so we didn't mi nd, you know, we
 got beaten up, so we went next day again 
an-and bring home  some thing, you know, and -- 
Q: So she didn™t try to keep you in the house? 

A: Not that I can tell. I™m sure she tried, but
 you know -- you know what that 10 year old child 
is, it™s -- you know, he goes anyway, you know. 
She turns around and he™s out, you know, it™s -- 
and that™s what I did, you know. A-And then it
™s by Nove mber of 1939 we were told, you know, 
I -- I was told by my grandmother, you know, we™v
e got to leave our apartment. We ™ve got to 
move to a certain area of Lódz, which was th
e poorest area of Lódz, 
which was called Baluty, 
you know, it™s funny enough, a lot of Jewish people li
ved there before the war, you see. And of 
course, a lot of Polish people lived -- now the Pole
s had to move out of their apartments and we 
had to move  into theirs. Now, the Poles were ve ry happy about it, because they moved into a 

good area, a nice apartment, nice furniture, beca
use we couldn™t take mu ch with us, you know, 
and out of the three bedroom ap
artment we had with a bathroom
, you know, a -- we ma naged my 
-- and I had an aunt also living with us, and th
e four of us moved into one single room on a 
second floor in a -- in a teneme nt building with 
stone steps. And it was already November, it was 
getting very cold. In November it™s full blown wint er in Poland and no running water, no toilet 

or everything. And the four of us had one 
single room, no kitchen, no nothing, you know, and -- 
Q: Do you reme mber going there? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
11 
 
Q: Do you reme mber how -- how was your grandmot
her and grandfather, how were they notified 
and -- and do you reme mber that mo me nt when they were notified?   

A: No, no. All I reme mber is going on a horse and 
cart, you know, with a bit 
of things we had to 
take with us, you know, we™ve -- I don™t -- I don
™t even know how we found it, that -- that 
apartment, but all I reme mber is living there.  

Q: And did you go -- was it far from where you lived? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: And you had to go across town? 

A: The other side of town, right across town. 

Q: Did you go with other people, or do you 
reme mber seeing people on the streets? 
A: Oh yes, there was a whole lo
t of people going all the time, 
from mor ning til night, moving 
there. I don™t even know how we found, whether 
we were offered that place, or we were 
allocated that place. I don™t 
know, that I cannot reme mber. Maybe I was too young to -- to know. 
But I know where it was, I reme mbe r  the name, th
e street, the number, th
e second floor, and -- 
Q: What was the street? 

A: Lima nowskiego 26. And it was, the thing was,
 you see, by April the 
whole -- everybody in 
Lódz had to be -- if he wa s caught outside th
e ghetto, he was shot. So
 by that they surrounded 
with barbed wire. They had -- we had our own 
Jewish police and a Jewish sort of committee, 
governme nt thing with a -- with 
a leader of that. His name , I™m
 sure you know, was Rumkowski. 
And -- but the street where I lived they had a 
problem because how would they go from -- the 
Germans or the Poles go from one side of town to
 the other?  So two streets were blocked -- were 
-- the actual road was outside the 
ghetto with barbed wires. And 
for us to cross -- we had the 
bridge, or two bridges to cross 
from one side -- because I work
ed on the other si de, we had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
12 
 
cross on a bridge. So they -- which wa s, in a way for -- for us it was lucky, because what was 
happening, when lorries with food 
and potatoes or carrots or some thing, they weren™t in sacks, 

they were loose -- or they [indecipherable], 
so, you know, you soon find ways, so we had long 
wires and we  used to try to hook them onto the 
lorries when they were passing, or a horse and 
cart, and mo ve that thing and they fell down 
and eventually we could get some  potatoes or 
whatever was on the [indecipherable] we had -- we 
had to try to steal things. But the worst thing 
was, winter came and you know, we had to go do
wnstairs to fetch wa
ter, you know, to pump 
actually water and to carry up [i ndecipherable] 
and that I still reme mber. I reme mber falling 
down because it was all frozen, you know, and it wa
s slippery from the water, you know, and -- 
Q: And that was your job, to go get the water? 

A: We ll, it wasn™t my job, but somebody had to do 
it. My grandfather coul
d -- certainly couldn™t 
do it because he was already too ill and, you know
, within a very short time he died, in 1940. 
And purely from -- from -- I think he had a broken 
heart because he was so religious and he so 
had -- even -- even the rabbis came and they
 said, you know, you can eat anything, because you 
know, life is more impor tant than
 anything else. But he wouldn™
t and he -- he died from 
malnutrition and -- and everythi ng else. So it was just left  my aunt still ther e an-and she died 

soon afterwards as well, and it was just my gran
dmother and I, and then they said, you know, we 
each could ge t the ration card, but you had to wo
rk. If you didn™t work, you didn™t ge t the ration 
card. I was about 10 and a half when I 
started working in a me tal factory. 
Q: Before we get to the me tal factory, tell me  
some thing about when your grandfather died. Did -

- did you take him -- there was a cemetery? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
13 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: And -- 

A: There was a cemetery in -- which is even th
ere today. You know, there was a cemetery just a -
- just outside but it was still in the ghetto. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Right at the end of town, there was a Jewish cemetery there. Because as I said too, you know, 

before the wa r there was a lot of Jewish people 
living in that area, in
 the poor area, you know, 
and of course so they had a cemetery. 

Q: And did some one come  and get his body and take him there -- 

A: Oh yes -- 

Q: -- or did you have to do that? 

A: -- yeah, it was a proper, it was a proper 
-- at that time still, in 1940, yes, proper -- 
Q: So that -- 
A: -- everybody that died in the ghetto was buried there. 
Q: And then there was 
a service of any kind? 
A: That I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I honestly don™t reme mber a servi -- I™m sure th
ere must have been something, and as I said, I 
-- one of my  uncles was in the ghetto. You see, my
 father wasn™t, but one of my uncles was in 
the ghetto, so I™m sure he was there that coul
d say kaddishim, you know, but I don™t reme mber it. 
I -- I certainly wasn™t at the fune
ral. Why?  Because I would say th
e first time I went to a funeral 
was in -- in London, in England. So I am sure I wasn™t. 

Q: You weren™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526

A: I would have reme mb ered. 
Q: Yeah. But -- so it would have been
 your grandmother and your aunt, ma ybe. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Would you tell me your 
aunt™s name  so we - -  
A: Genya Szyper. 

Q: Genya. And how was she re
lated to your grandparents? 
A: She -- she was a daughter. 

Q: Oh, your father™s sister? 

A: Sim -- a sister, yes, as I said to you in the 
beginning, there were three si
sters, two died before 
the war, and one rema ined, and th
at  was the one that remained. 
Q: And she was single? 

A: Single, yes. 

Q: Yeah. Younger than your father? 
A: Yes. She was the youngest in the fa mily. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you know how old sh
e would have been, ro-roughly? 
A: I honestly don™t know, but she must have been
 pretty young, be -- I k
now my father was born 
in 1900, and that means he would have been 40 in -- when I was in the ghetto with my aunt and 

my grandparents at the time . So she could have be
en -- she must have died when she was about, I 
don™t know, 38 or some thing like, I do -- 35, you know -- 

Q: And -- and you think it was also 
ma lnutrition like your grandfather? 

A: Malnutrition also, and I reme mber she had a 
boyfriend. I reme mber then, as a young kid like 

that, I reme mber she had a boyfriend and then th
ey split up, some thing, and she was also -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
15 
 
don™t think she wanted to live, you know. The ci
rcumstances we lived in, you know, and she had 
nothing to live for, you know, and -- and -- and 
unfortunately she also died, and -- and -- 
Q: That winter? 
A: Wi nter, oh yes. 

Q: The first winter? 

A: Oh yes, the first winter, yes. 

Q: Your grandmother must have been a strong person. 

A: She was, you know, I mean you™ve got to re
member women in -- in Poland and Russia and 
eastern Europe, you know, before the war, they
 were hard working. Whe n I think back, you 
know, to bring up six children, you know, without 
-- without help. We  ha d no ma ids or help. 
You know, to bring up six children, to -- to c
ook and wash and as you, I™m sure you know, in 

Poland, you know, a lot of food, you know, you ma de
 yourself. You didn™t go to shop to buy you 
know, you know. Like vermicelli, you know, 
[indecipherable] you know, you -- you ma de 
yourself. I reme mber that. And -- and even 
the challahs, you know, you baked yourself, and you 
know, I just -- and I -- all I know is I think my 
-- my grandmother already had the first child 

when she was 16 years old because in them da
ys in Poland, when you were 20 and you weren™t 

ma rried, you were already on the shelf, you know
, it was a stigma . How come  you don™ t just -- 
not ma rried, or some thing like that. So no, she -- 
she must have be -- you wouldn™t, if you looked 

at her, and I look at her pictur
e now and I think she couldn™t have
 been that strong, but she was. 
Q: We need to take a lit
tle break and change tapes. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And we™ll come  back in a mi nute. 

A: That™s quite all right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526

Q: Okay. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
17 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: W- We  were talking about your grandmother before
 we took a break and I -- I just want to ask 
you one other question about her. W- Was she -- did she -- was she optimistic in any way?  Wa s 
she giving you hope throughout this period, 
and was she the strong one in the -- 
A: It was -- absolutely, she was -- she -- she 
ne ver thought oh, we™ll get killed, or  we will not 
survive. It wa s always, I don™t know, I™m sure she 
didn™t believe what she was telling me , but she 
always, oh, it won™t last long, it™ll get better, and so
 on. And I think this is also a Jewish trait, you 
know, of it™ll get better, don™t worry, you know, an
-and the usual thing you know, with Jewish 

people, you know, next week, next -- you know, and 
-- and God will see to it and so on and so 
on. No, she was -- she wa  -- I don™t know, like I said, whether she was optimistic or she was just 

talking to me as a child, you know. 

Q: Right. When you were in the ghetto, you got a job in a me tal factory. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah, tell me  about that job.  
A: It was -- we were produci
ng all different things for the German war effort, you know, an-and 
there were different groups. I was assigned to a 
group that we were produci
ng little me tal things 
that were going onto shoes, you know, so that th
e soles, and you know, and -- and the heels, to 
last, there were some  little s -- round things to put
 on the soles so that they should last , the shoes 
should last longer, you shouldn™t wear them out as
 quick as that. So it was two of us, one was 
putting things into a wooden things, six of them
, and the other one was making holes into them, 
you know what -- 

Q: With a -- with a press? 

A: With a press, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
18 
 
Q: Yeah. You were 10 years old. 
A: I was 10 and a half, you know. 

Q: Mm-hm. Is that  -- 

A: You know ac -- you know, ya -- this you get sa -- 
no, it wasn™t a question that I a -- I had to 
work because if I didn™t work then there was 
no ration card, there was no food. Whatever little 
food we had, I had to obtain on my ration card. At
 work we worked like six days a week from 
what, I don™t know, seven to seven or some thing, 
and there was nightshifts as well, which I 
didn™t work and lunch time we used to get a soup
 and -- to keep us going and so on, and I had a 
very good man that I worked for, that he was 
the boss of the group of about, I don™t know, 20 or 
so. And he was very good, he tried to look after 
me  for a certain -- to a certain extent, you know. 
When he thought that I -- I can™t do it, you know, 
because I™m so tired, he says go underneath the 
bench and sleep for an hour and so on. Because there was no -- we weren™t surrounded by 

Germans, you know, it was all done by Jews. 
Everything was Jewish, you know, whether it was 
doctors or hospital, or whatever, you know. But 
unfortunately, the food that we were -- were 
getting, even with the rations, 
every month, you know, it got worse 
and worse, or less and less, 
and people ar e dying of malnutrition and -- and of 
course, fr ost and --  it was that  cold. You 
know, when the summer  came, of course it was a bit better. But every morning we used to go to 

work, and -- you know and we were -- had to step
 over dead bodies, cause they didn™t have a 
chance yet -- they had a special 
group of people that were taking 
the bodies away and then taki ng 
it to the -- I suppose there were ma ss graves, you know. 

Q: You me a n -- are bodi
es in the street? 
A: In the street, yes, we had to just go wa
lk over them al most, to go to work, and you know, you 
get so immu ne, you know, that you just don™t care any more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
19 
 
Q: And whe r e -- where was the factory?  Where did you go to work? 
A: The factory was about on the other side, as I sa
id to you we ha -- I had to cross the bridge and 
it wasn™t that far, it was about 20 mi nutes, half an
 hour to walk to the factory. It was a very big 
factory. 

Q: Did your mother go, or I mean, your grandmother go as well? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. She -- 

Q: Did you go by yourself?  You walked -- 

A: -- I -- yes, oh yes. I -- you were quite safe
, you know, as far as walking in the ghetto, you 
know, you had no problems there, you know. But unfor
tunately, you know, it™s -- it™s the -- the 
ma in thing there was the food and -- and the conditions we lived in. And, you know, by the time  

we -- we went into the ghetto we were 
about 150,000, eventually finished with 70,000. But 
people were dying. Also people th
at were comi ng in and sendi
ng -- they said we need 5,000 
people to go out to work, you know, in -- in labor
 camps. Which wasn™t true, we found out later 
because the people that were taken, you know, they
 were like  -- but the pr oblem was they took 
people out so that you thought ther
e was more room. But then what
 the Germans di d, the S -- the 
Nazis, the SS or whoever they were, they were 
liquidating all the small ghettos because they said 

it™s useless having more guards to guarding small 
ghettos, we™ll take those people and send them 

to the bi gger camp -- ghettoes like Lódz or Wa rsaw or whatever there was. So every time they 

sent people in, you know, from other ghettoes, so 
it was -- it was never enough room for people 
to -- to -- to exist, to live, to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
20 
 
Q: Did you n -- did you know that at the time , di
d you know that people were comi ng from other 
ghettos? We re you talking to people, or -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You know, they sat and you know, they told us 
how bad it is there. Th
ey didn™t realize how 
much worse it is in our ghetto, because Lódz 
was -- Lódz and Wa rsaw was one of the worst 
ghettos in Poland you know, because [indecipherable]
 was -- a small ghetto was not, but we were 
so overcrowded, you know, and -- and like I said, ove
rcrowded. In the winter it was cold, in the 
summer -- I don™t know what was worse, because 
disease in the summer was worse, you know. 
Luckily that -- that at least we had enough water to wash. 

Q: And how was your hea
lth?  Did you get sick? 

A: Well, as far as I know, all the years I was in
 the ghetto, I wasn™t ill.
 I had no problem with 
illness. I was problem with lack of food. I 
was -- you know, i -- hunger is a funny thing. It 
doesn™t ma tter how muc h you eat, you™re still hungr
y, because it™s all in your mi nd most of the 
time. You know, even when I had -- when we used
 to go out sort of near
 the outskirts of the 
ghetto, you know, and there was some  stuff we c
ould steal, you know, and -- so we used to go, a 
few of the kids used to go out and you know, then
 we were either at the borders, you know, of it 
-- of -- where the barbed wire, 
you were hit by the Germans, or 
the Jewish police culture, you 
know, we were sort of -- have the 
-- our jackets or shirts inside th
e trousers, so that we could put 
the food away there and they caught us, they ju
st opened it up and the food came out. We  got a 

good hiding and we run back home a nd that was it. 
But then -- but they didn™t stop us going 
again, you know. But if -- there we
re times, of course, that we ma naged to get home with some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
21 
 
food and we  had so muc h food, and -- but we were
 still -- it doesn™t matter how much we had, 
we were hungry. 
Q: Yeah. In the Lódz ghetto they we
re rounding up children too, weren't they? 
A: We ll yeah, of course. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes, but the worst thing was -- you see, 
was in -- I think it was 1942, the Germans decided 
they need 10,000 people, you know, a day or some
thing like that, some thing -- an enormous 
amount of people -- 

Q: Right, yeah. 

A: -- and they™ll do it in a week 
and they™ll take them a way, so most of the people they would 
have taken away. But I asked the -- which I don™
t think it could have been 10,000, but they said -
- the Jewish police have to go and give them 
every day so ma ny people to bring out. But of 
course they came to the -- to the Jewi sh homes
 and they got beaten up by the people. Nobody 
would have given away people, you know, nobody 
would go. And then the Jews -- so the 
Germans said there is no way they can do it, so 
they said they are going 
to do it themselves, and -
- 

Q: Did they ever come  to your place? 

A: Oh yes. Not the Jewish police, I don™t reme mber them c o mi ng, but the Germans said right, 

we™re going to do it systematically, nobody™s 
going to work for a whole week. And from 
Monday onwards, you know, they went from street
 to street, house to house and everybody had 
to come  down and they took people away and th
ey said they™re taking them to work. But you 
know, as young as I was, you know, I -- I realize
d, you know, you don™t take people to work that 
are disabled people, old people, wome n a
nd children. And my grandmother was hidden 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
22 
 
some where and I went down and they took me , they slung me on the lorry and it was a similar 
scene, funny enough, like in ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ 
And I -- I don™t know why it was so bad and I 
was alone, I s -- I would have thought why did I 
want to escape?  Maybe because I thought to 
myself I™ll be alone and I wanted to be back 
with my grandmother and I jumped off the lorry. 
And the Germans were inside the yard, you know, 
had they stepped out they would have seen 
me , they would have shot . I™m sure they would ha
ve hit me  because I wouldn't have been that far 

away. Anyway, I -- I was lucky once again and I r
un and I hid myself in the house and I stayed 
there for hours. And I reme mber a distant cuz --
 well, it -- a distant c
ousin came and he also 
escaped, also jumped off the lorry and he escape 
and I reme mber -- I reme mber like today and he 
says, come  on, let™s go home , cause we lived in the 
same  sort of block or yard or some thing. And 

I started screaming at him, I was in such a st
ate, you know. Eventually, of course, I did. But the 
funny thing was, it -- 

Q: What did you scream? 
A: I just screamed at him that why he said to
 me we should go back home, I was -- I don™t know, 
I was -- my mi nd was completely -- I was co
mple tely confused, you know, and -- but a funny 
thing happened that that boy, that 
cousin of mi ne was the only one of his fa mily that survived, 
and not so ma  -- and he was very religious. 
And -- and he became the chief rabbi of Poland. 
About 10 years ago he wa s a -- or 15 years ago, a 
chief rabbi of Poland. He lived in Jerusalem, 
but -- 
Q: What was his name? 

A: Joskovich. And anyway, I went back and afte
r awhile things went back to as it wa s, you 

know, my gr andmother came back and -- 

Q: Where had she gone? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
23 
 
A: She went to hiding some
where, I don™t know where. 
Q: You don™t know where?  Not in a building? 
A: No, it mu st have been from my uncle, you 
know, I don™t honestly know. May -- could have 
been in a baseme nt somewhere.  

Q: But when you -- when they took -- came to
 take people away, she was -- she was gone? 
A: She wasn™t there, shewas gone, you know, she sha -- 

Q: And you had come  home  a
nd found that she was gone? 

A: And -- no, she wasn™t there, 
but I knew she was in hiding. 
Q: And why didn™t you go to hiding? 

A: I -- there was no way I could go, for some  -- I 
don™t know what the reason it was, but I wasn™t 
-- I didn™t go into hiding and -- 

Q: And the Germans came and phys ically dragged you out? 

A: Oh yeah -- no, we had to go downstairs, th
ey didn™t come . Everybody had to leave and they 
searched the rooms, you know, and dow
nstairs they said they just 
picked up people and -- and -- 
and I saw wome n, children, disabled
 people, it™s not -- some thing 
is not right, and this was the 
reason it made me jump -- jumped off the lo
rry, and you know, and -- an
d we found out later, 
you know, we never had all those people again, so 
we knew that they were -- where they were 
taken I don™t know, but they were
 certainly -- at that time  th
ere was no Auschwitz yet -- you 
know, I mean there was Auschwitz because Auschw
itz was built much earlier, but it wasn™t built 
for Jews, it was built for Polish prisoners of wa
r, you know, and certainly Birkenau wasn™t in 

existence. And you know, in -- within two days we
 went back to work and we carried on and -- 
and things got worse and worse and wors
e, til it carried on like that til 1944. 
Q: Two -- three years. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
24 
 
A: Mm -- well, I was -- from 1940 til 1944, you know, was -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- April 1940 the ghetto was shut, you know
, and it™s liquidated in autumn of 1944.  
Q: We re there other deportati
ons that you escaped?  I mean -- 
A: Not from Lódz, no. I never escaped another 
deportation, Lódz or ot
herwise, you know, it -- 
but when they liquidated the ghetto it was automa
tically -- but where I wa
s -- you see, I -- I don™t 
know, in my  life I always seem to have been luck
y. And were -- the factory that I worked for, the 
me tal factory, when we -- the Lódz ghetto was 
liquidated because they said the Russians are 
getting nearer, and we™ve got to
 -- they™re going to send us to
 working camps inside Germany, 
and so street by street, day by day, they were 
taking away peop -- people had to report to the 
railway station and they were allowed to take on
e suitcase. They said when we get there we get 
more clothes and all the rest of it. But me , they di
dn™t take -- they didn™t tell us to come from the 
house where I lived then, but from the factory, becau
se I said they were going to take us to 
Germany and we™re going to work in a me tal fa
ctory there. Which the funny thing was that it 
was true. We didn™t reach Germany t o work 
in a factory, but that
 was the intention. 
Q: This factory -- the fellow you me ntioned who 
ran the factory, say his name , because he was 
very important to you. 
A: Well, th-the man that -- that  saved my life -- 

Q: Yes -- 

A: -- twice --  

Q: Yes. 

A: -- you know, he saved my life, his name  wa
s Zilbershatz. And also a funny thing that a 
nephew of his is a friend of mi ne today, 
he lives in London, you know. And the ma n also 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
25 
 
survived the war, the one, Willie Zi lbershatz, he
 lived in Israel. Unfortunately I never managed 
to see hi m because by the time I went the first time to Israel, he was -- he died. But I am very 
much in touch with his nephew and -- you know, and -- 

Q: Did you know very much about him before he
 had this factory in 
the ghetto?  Did he -- 
A: We ll, he didn™t have a factory, 
he was just in charge of that 
group. It was a very big factory. It 
was -- some body else wa s in charge of th
e whole factory, his name was Hemovich. 

Q: I see, it wasn
™t his factory.  
A: No, no, no, it wasn't  his factory, it was -- it
 was nobody™s factory, it be
longed to the ghetto, 
you know, it belonged to the Germans really. I don™t 
know what it was before the war, whether it 
was a factory before th
e war and who owned it. 
Q: So he was the ma nager. 

A: He was the ma nager and you know, they had groups, ma nagers of each, you know, like 20 

people worked in one group and -- and that ma n Zilb
ershatz was in charge 
of that group that I 
worked for. 

Q: Wa s he a young ma n?  He -- 

A: Yes, oh yes, he must have been about 30 at
 the most, you know. You know
, to me he wasn™t a 
young ma n, you know, and I -- I was 10 years old, 11 
years old, 12 years old, a -- he wasn™t a 

young ma n, you know, but he was a very young ma n. 

Q: And there were time s  when he saw that
 you were tired and he
 let you rest -- 
A: Rest, oh yes. 

Q: -- were there other children?  We re 
there other children working there? 

A: There were a few other children. I d -- I 
don™t reme mber whether the others, you know, I -- I 
ha -- I don™t know what it is, but I -- I think I™
ve always had a -- in Yiddish they would say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
26 
 
chutzpah, you know. And I still have. I™m 78 year
s old and I still have a chutzpah today, you 
know. And I think I get away with many things whic
h others mi ght not have got away with them. 
So he was very good to me  as that was, you 
know, and there were some  good people there. Not 
ma ny, but there were some . It™s -- it wasn™t a question that a -- I mean, people become  very 
selfish, you know, everybody wants to live, so why, 
if he™s got some thing more than you, why 

should he share with you, you know? You gotta be 
a real great person to do that, and you know, 
not many pe ople are around like that, to share th
eir last pi ece of bread or some thing, you know. 
But there were some, and I came across them. 

Q: So tell about when the n -- when 
in ™44 they liquidated the ghetto.  
A: Yes, they told us that we™re going to Germa
ny, and that we™re going to
 build the factory. And 
again we had to get just one su
itcase, and I went with my gran
dmother to the station. She also 
came -- as I was in the metal factory, she came w
ith my group, as a group. And we went to the 
station, reported 
to the station. 
Q: She didn™t work in the factory. 

A: No, she didn™t work. 

Q: So that you -- 

A: But nevertheless, she came with us, you know. 

Q: They allowed -- so this was the manager -- 

A: Yes, well, they allowed -- 

Q: -- her to do that. 

A: -- yes -- well, yes. And as we arrived, you know
, th-there were cattle 
trucks waiting for us, 
you know, which I couldn™t understand, you know, and they just said, take a suitcase, get onto 

the cattle trucks. We  were helped by the Jewish 
police. And this is when it started. We  thought, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
27 
 
you know, that things are bad in -- in -- in 
the ghetto, but that™s when our trouble started, 
between 1944 and 1945, those were the worst -- the 
worst year, well it was le
ss than a year that 
happened to me that stand out in my -- mostly in
 my -- first of all I was already older. I was 
already, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half
. I was already -- to 
my way of t hinking, I 
was already a grown up person al
ready. And when they put us 
in the -- those trucks, do you 
know, it was just impossible to survive. It 
was so packed, you couldn™t breathe. And do you 
know, today, I said that ma ny ti me s, you know, I 
feel ashame d, not only for other people, for 
myself, wha t  can happen to a person, that when 
we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped some where 
after a day or so, and -- and there were a few 
people were dead, you know. First of all there -- 
there was no water to drink. You remember like I sa
id to you, we™re -- it was July, August, in the 
summer in Poland, the heat. You know, you talk about
 your sort of 90 degrees or something like 
that, packed like sardines. A
nd people, you know, elderly people, people that ha-had problems 
were dying and -- and I™m so as
hamed today, you know, when I th
ink of it, how could I have 
ever done that, say thank God they
 died, there™ll be more room for us, you know?  And of course 
at that time  it -- that™s how I felt, but -- and mo
st people, and -- but toda
y when I think back, like 
I wasn™t huma n any more, you know?  How can a human
 be ing think like that? 
To be that selfish, 
you know?  But unfortunately that™s
 how it is, you know. I -- I saw children stealing a piece of 
bread from their father. I saw a father s-stea
ling a piece of bread from -- from a child. And do 
you know I™m a father today and a gr
andfather and I think 
I would rather die th
an do that. But if I 
would have a father then, would he steal from
 me, or would I steal from him?  Maybe. I don™t 
know, you know. You™ve got to be in that position to 
realize. It™s easy to say how could he do it, 
but today, you know what, I™ve got a fa mily and 
I™ve got -- I™m not shor
t of -- of anything, you 
know. When I say anything, food, or 
drink, or -- I can say that. Would -- how would it have been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
28 
 
in those circumstances, you know, if I was starving 
and knowing that my child has got a piece of 
bread, could I have stolen it?  Ma
y -- I definitely say today no, 
but I don™t know. You have to be 
in those circumstances to reali
ze whether you can do it or not. A
nd we traveled for a few days 
and it was less and less people in -- in -- in 
-- in the coaches, you know. And eventually one 
morning at about, must have been five, six 
o™clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you 
know, we could see through the slats, you know, of
 the truck, some thing written up, Oswiecim, 
and then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn™t mean
 anything to me , an-and the grown up people say 
oh, it™s a concentration camp, a
nd I didn™t know what a concen
tration camp was. And they 
opened it, the gates and straight
 away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus. And 
there were people sort of wearing striped things
 and striped caps and 
we did -- still didn™t 
understand that. And it was -- like I 
said, it was in the summe r  and it was hazy, the sun was hazy 
because it wa s very early in the morning. And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we 

saw chimne ys and we saw that™s bakeries, or [i
ndecipherable] whatever 
it is there, and -- and 
then, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, 
and it was pretty high, and some  of those people 
that were there, they were Jewish inmates of 
Auschwitz that helped people to jump down. We  

weren't allowed to take our suitcase, they sa
id, you leave everything 
behind. When you get to 
where we going, we get our luggage
 back, you know, and of course, we didn™t. And then we had 
to go through a selection committee. And here 
we go again, I was lucky again. Being in the 
factory, we were a main transpor t that went 
through the selection committee. Wo men, children, 

disabled people, everybody went through. We  we
re 500 and odd people. But the train had ma ny 
more people on it, and all the others had to go -- 
the selection, there were German offi cers with 
dogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and 
they were rushing them, and you know it was 
right and left , right and left. And then we real
ized what was happening, that the people going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
29 
 
the right were disabled people, wome n with babies
, with children. And some  of the m -- and there 
were screams, you know, because th
ey -- they -- they took the child away and the woma n they 
said to go to the left. And of course, can you im
agine a mother giving up a child. So the mother 
run towards it, she was beaten, but she was left 
with the child. And they
 said they™re going to 
take them to showers, but we found out soon afterwards, you know, beca -- from the guards, 
from the Jewish people that were [indecipherable]
 that an hour after a -- 
that train arrived in 
Auschwitz, in Birkenau, you know, those people were
 dead. They were gassed and put in -- and 
how can a huma n being do that?  Taking a chil
d, a p -- a person, a woma n, a disabled person, 

whoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned? It
 just -- but unfortuna
tely I learned. I™m now 
an old man so I™ve learned that it™s -- appear 
it™s happening today. I mean, ma ybe not to the -- 
that extent and ma ybe not to th
e Jewi sh people, but it™s happening. And us they took to -- the 
people that went to the left, we 
all we nt to showers. They were 
actually showers, they were not 
gas -- they were not gas cha -- crematoriums, ga s 
chambers. And we had to take all our clothes 
off and we never saw it again. They shaved everybody, whoever had hair, wherever you had hair 

had to be shaved, wome n and me n. And we ca me 
out and they gave us striped clothing. And of 
course the wome n went separate 
to a different one, we went se
parate. And had a -- one of those 
caps. They didn™t tattoo us at the time, it was -- I don™t know whether that
 was because we were 
with a group, or whether they didn™t tattoo any mo
re people, but they -- bu
t we had a number, so 
at that time  that was -- I wasn™t Ziggy Shi
pper, I was 83303. Not that anybody called me  by the 
number or so, but that™s what I 
had writ -- a stripe, think here. 
Q: On your jacket? 

A: On my jacket, yes, an-and trousers. A
nd I remember like today, and I don™t know why, you 
know, they just gave me  a uniform, one of those 
striped thing. I mean, they didn™t say oh, you are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
30 
 
small, we give you a small one, big one, and I go
t a very big one, and I don™t -- and you know 
that my trousers went almost to -- under myar ms. And some body came, oh I got the smaller one, 
can you give me  the bigger one
?  I don™t know why, you know, I re
me mbe r  like today I said no. 
Maybe I thought because it™s bigger it™ll be warm
er in the winter or some thing. I didn't  know 
how long I™m going to wear those. Anyway, aft e
r the showers, disinfection, haircut, you know, 
shaving, we -- they went into barracks. Now th
at I -- we expected ma ny things, but we didn™t 
expect that. I don™t know whether 
you know what it looked like. I we
nt back after the war to see 
that and you know, it was bunks, three bunks, oneout -- above the other. You know, three bunks, 

I don™t remember if I was in 
the bottom or mi ddl
e. I think I was in the mi ddle bunk. Three 
persons to a bunk, you know. Two one way, one that. 
And straw and every morning we used to 
get the -- it was hot, you were -- could suffocate. 
Every morning we had black coffee and a piece 
of bread. Every evening we had -- we didn™t wor
k. We  just had to stand outside all day long, you 
know, and then go back. 
Q: Let™s take  a little brea
k and I™ll change the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: You were talking about 
your arrival at Auschwitz. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: The summer of 1944? 

A: Yes. 

Q: I™d like to know if we coul
d back up just 
a little bit. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you have any sense of from the tim
e those doors opened on 
the cattle car -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to the time  you wer e  in your barracks, 
how much time passed by?  
Was it a matter of -- 
A: Matter of hours. 

Q: Hours. 

A: It wasn™t a ma tter of 
days or anything like that. 
Q: Right. 

A: It was very, very qui -- one
 thing what they did was ev
erything was quick. Quick, quick, 
quick. From the mi nute the ghetto [indeciphera
ble] opened, you know, all you heard was raus, 
raus, raus, quick, quick, quick. And even the se
lection, when you wentthrough selection, if you 
weren™t fast they were beati
ng you, you see?  That™s why they 
had those batons, you know, those 
big things and they were knocking you, you know. 

Q: Right. 

A: Hitting you, and you know, and -- 

Q: It must have been so 
frightening, so chaotic and so
 like a nightma re when you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
32 
 
A: We ll, it™s -- it was a ni ghtma re because you 
-- you just di dn™t -- you couldn™t understand what 
was happening to you and to the people. What™s 
going on, you know?  It wasn™t like -- it wasn™t 
like being in the ghetto, you know, that every week
 it got a bit worse and more people are dying 
and -- and pe ople are dying of starvation and what
ever else , of illness, and you know. But here it 

was some thing happened so fast, you know, an-a
nd -- and the people kept asking, where are 
they?  Where™s my wi fe, where™s my mother, 
where™s my child, where™s -- you know, the ma  -- 

me n would be saying, you know, and then -- and 
there was no answer, because there wasn™t 
other camps that you could see them. You know, 
where have they gone?  But they soon found 
out, you see, because the -- the inma tes, you know, 
th-the ones that were doing all the cleaning 
up and the disposing of the bodies, you know, and so on after they were gassed they had to put 

them in the ovens, you know, and -- to cremate th
em in. They asked them, and they were soon 
told, you know, what it is. But you know, even th
en, as a 14 year old boy, you doi -- i-it didn™t 
sort of -- possibly, personally, I was lucky. 
I came with my grandmother and I knew my 
grandmother is still there. I had no siblings, 
you know, so I didn't have to worry about where -- 
where™s my little sister, or my brothe
r, or -- or -- nothing 
s -- sort of happened to me  that I should 
feel in a terrible state, you know?  And at14 and a half, do you care what happens to other 

people, you know?  And especially in
 the position where we are all 
in, like I said to you before, 
you become  so selfish and so ha
rd, that all you care is abou
t yourself, don™t care about anybody 
else. Because you are not human any more. They dis-humanized you. You know, yo-you -- you 

become  a terrible person. I found th
at out years later [indecipherab
le]. But you see it today even, 
you know, in -- you know, people in 
-- in -- in the Afri
can nations or in 
the Middle East, you 
know, you know, people starving, you know and -- a
nd you become  -- you steal. You steal from 
each other, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
33 
 
Q: So you were in the barracks with [indecipherable] 
A: I was in barracks with -- th-there were -- 

Q: -- a men™s barracks, in a -- 

A: Yes, a men™s barrack, there must have been 
at least eight - 900 people 
in the barracks. There 
certainly -- there was room for the m because 
we -- everybody s -- had where to sleep. The only 
thing the stench, the smell, th
-the -- the heat, you know, i -- and 
people were dying there, they 
didn™t have to kill them, they didn™t have to take them to g -- the gas chambers to ki ll them, they 

were dying there. Wa t -- anybody that was there wa
s finished, you know. Either he -- first of all 
he couldn™t survive and secondly they took him aw
ay and took him to -- straight away to a gas 
chamber. 

Q: You would sleep three to a bunk? 

A: Three to a bunk, and there were three bunks right
, and there was another one next to it again, 

so it was like 18 people in a square sort of thing. 
Q: Could you sleep? 
A: I would imagine so, you know, as a child, ye
s, you know, and a -- the problem was always, 
you know, if you gi -- when you got your piece of
 bread and you thought you™
ll put it under the -
- inside you -- in your jacket because you slept 
in your clothes, there 
was no undressing. And you 
couldn™t sleep. That™s the only time  I couldn™
t sleep, personally, you know, it -- when I knew I 
had a piece of bread there. I had to eat it up, you know and then I ma naged I™m sure after, to 

sleep. You know, and we got up very early to 
c™est l™appel, which wa
s the counting of the 
people. Why they had to count people, what were
 they worried, they were going to kill them 
anyway, why were they worried whether wa
s one mi ssing or not, you know?  But that™s the 
Germans. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
34 
 
Q: During those times when you were in the barr
acks, did people -- what did people talk about? 
What did they --  
A: I di -- di -- 

Q: -- what wa s it like? Do you reme mber that? 

A: No. No. Well, the only thing we were talking 
about, when will it finish. When will we get out 
of here, will we survive, will th
ey take  -- because we already knew about the gas chambers then. 
Will they take us away to the gas chambers? Bu
t -- ami -- but me  as a child of 14 or 14 and a 
half, it never entered my mi nd that I™ll be ki
lled. I could never understa
nd -- you know, I saw my 
friends dying, I saw other people 
dying. But I could neve
r -- I couldn™t accept it, that I™ll die. 
That eventually it will be the end, you know
?  And you know, there were always rumors, you 
know, the Russians are near, the British are near
, the Americans are comi ng in. Eventually we 
will be rescue d. You know what, ma ybe that he lped
 me  to survive, I don™t know. But I survived 
that and after a few weeks, not very long, we 
weren't a long time  in Auschwitz, they found us. 
The Germans actually found us and they took us 
-- they said, right, now
 we™re going towards 
Germany, which we didn™t, we went -- well, it -- 
in a way we did, I suppose, because they took 
us to a concentration camp. 

Q: Oh s -- is this group of people -- 

A: The group of 500, yes. 

Q: -- that worked in the factory?  

A: Yes, they to -- 

Q: And including your mother? 

A: My grandmother. 

Q: I™m sorry, your grandmother. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
35 
 
A: Yes, my grandmother. And we we nt to
 a concentration camp called -- it wasn™t a 
extermination camp, it was a concentration camp cal
led Stutthof, which was very near Danzig. 
Now there was a bigger problem because as hot as
 it was in Auschwitz, we were going on to the 
Baltic. And after a few weeks in that  camp -- 
the camp was west, the living accommodation -- 
and the food was even worse than Auschwitz. We  
again didn™t work, but it was getting late, you 
know, after a few weeks, you know, it was getting Se
ptember, October, November, most people 
that were with us, even from that group, we re dying. You know, the elderly people were dying, 

you know, from sp -- pure starvation and disease. 
And what we were saying when I -- I was 

asked, was I small, or was I tall, or was I,
 for a child of 14 and a half or so, I was 

[indecipherable] at 15. No, I was sma ll. And what we did, when it was cold in the camp  they 

ma de huma n ovens. Wh at it meant to people was 
sort of getting together and ma ke group and get 
bigger, bigger, bigger, sort of a round thing. A
nd what we were supposed to do, the people from 
inside were comi ng out and going outside. And so
 me , I ca me out, but I soon ma naged, as being 
very little, I managed to get 
in -- back inside t-to -- 
Q: Back inside. So just th
e [indecipherable] bodies -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: They were huddled in a circle -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- and people were s -- 

A: That™s right, a huma n oven. 

Q: How long would they do this for? 

A: Oh, we could stand for hours like that, you 
know. You know, we couldn™t fall because we 
were all s-squashed together. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
36 
 
Q: And si -- and you weren™t working, so -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- this would go on -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- outside? 

A: The only work that we ™re do -- the only work 
we had to do was carrying big stones from one 
of the camp to the other side. When it was there 
we -- they had to carry it back to the other. 
There was no work there. There was just -- they
 wanted to kill you, but there was no such a thing 
as -- as they took you to the -- only if you were il
l. Of course there, th
ere was no hospitals or 
anything. They straight away took you to the gas 
chamber. They only had one gas chamber, one 
crematorium. And that -- the only problem was 
in the winter, if some body did escape and there 
was w -- a person mi ssing, we had to stand there 
all day long in the cold, in below freezing 
temperatures to stand there, you know. And th
en what happened -- of course, food was even 
scarcer than it was in Auschwitz. 
Then they said they wanted 20 young people to go to work in a 
cat -- in a working camp. And I said -- they sa
id, who is 17, and I couldn™t volunteer 17, I was 14 
and a half and my size was about 12 years old. A
nd they said there wasn™t enough, so they said, 
who is 16?  And I stood on my toes
 and I lifted my hand. And everybody said, all the others were 
saying don™t volunteer, don™t 
volunteer, they™re going to
 kill you. I said, listen, 
if I stay here I™ll 
be dead within a very short 
time . No food and cold and frost. I™m going. And so they took 20 
boys, all Polish boys, Jewish boys, you know, and th
ey took, by passenger train -- oh, they gave 
us -- by the way, they gave us ne
w winter clothes, which was the 
same  stripes, but warmer. So I 
said, well it™s getting better 
already. A -- and they -- you know, lis
ten, everything is -- is a ma tter 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
37 
 
of -- it™s relativ
e to it, you know, it -- a
nd they took us on passenger trains, oddly enough, to a 
place called Stolp in Pome rania. 
Q: Before you tell me  a bout that, did you have
 a conversation with your grandmother about 
leaving? 

A: Ah y-y -- only through the wires I could shout
, because I could see her. You know, and I said, 
I™m going away and I™ll see you after the war. 
You know, everything was 
I™ll see you after the 
war, you know. 

Q: What did she say? 

A: Nothing, she -- I don™t reme mber exactly the 
words she said. I suppose she must have said 
some thing in Yiddish to bless me , or some thi
ng. And ma ybe that helpe
d, you know, and I -- they 
took us, like I said, on those passe
nger trains. We  arrived at that
 Stolp. And the only thing that 
was better, it was in the winter, 
still Pome rania, which is very 
cold. But it was warme r  for us 
because we worked on a railway yard, you see, 
to do with the trains and so on, I don™t know 
what. And the food was even slightly better. We  -- 
at least we  got some thing, a piece of bread in 
the morning and in the evening and lunchtime 
we had the soup. And we had -- we worked for 
German people, and not the army, just German people. 

Q: Really? 

A: We  were guarded by the -- but we worked for 
-- it was a factory there, that we worked at. 
Q: I™m sorry, tell me  where Pome rania is, my geography is not that good. 

A: It is that -- today 
it™s Poland, at that time  
it was Germany, it was east. 
Q: So it™s eastern -- 

A: East, yes. 

Q: -- western Poland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
38 
 
A: Yes. It was -- it™s about -- I would say about
 50 kilome ters from Danzig, you know, so it was 
also near  the Baltic, but it wasn™t on the Baltic. And also the advantage was, there were only 
Jewish people in that camp. This was a labor 
camp, there was no exterm
ination, like I said. And 
working on the railways, there™s al
ways a chance to steal some  food. 
Q: Cause these were passenger trains? 

A: There were passenger trains, there were goods
 trains. Thank God ther
e were goods trains so 
we could [indecipherable] goods tr
ain, we ma naged to eat whatever their goods they were 
carrying, we ma naged to get them, 
we ma naged to steal some  carrots or potatoes or beets. The 
only thing wa s, whatever we stole we had to 
eat raw there. We coul
dn™t cook it, there was 
nowhere to cook. But it didn™t 
-- it tasted very good, you know. Doesn™t ma tter, when you™re 
hungry everything tastes good. You know, the unfortunate
 part was there, that one day five boys, 
older than I was, they stole some cigarettes or  
tobacco that was going to the German army, to the 

front, where they were fighting. And they were caught. So they put them -- there was a little 
room like a disinfection room, with no windows, 
nothing. They put them there and they kept 
them there for a week, then they said -- thenthey announced they™re going to let them out. But 
the problem was they -- we had to come  
and see those boys. I don™t know how those boys 
survived without water, without food, without a
nything in that thing. But when we came to the 
square where they were going to let out, we sa
w gallows, five gallows and little stools standing 
there. And they took those boys out, they put th
ose ropes round their neck -- five boys, and I 
mean, I™ve seen people die next to me, you 
know, and -- but I™ve never seen some body young, 
you know, putting a rope around their necks and going 
to hang. And they were start to read out 

why they™re being, you know, Ger ma
n, another thing, they had to -- why did they have to say 
why?  They were going to hang them. But those five
 boys didn™t give them a chance, even. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
39 
 
jumped off the stools and they killed themselves, th-they didn™t wait for the Germans to kill 
them. 

Q: Oh. 

A: All five of them. And that 
was, like I said, the fi rst time 
I saw people being hanged, actually, 
you know, people not dying, but bein
g people killed. I mean, when they took away the people to 
the gas chambers, we didn™t see it, we only saw the 
people taking away. But here
 I -- it™s -- it™s -- 
it -- do you know, I can see it today 
like it™s happening now, in front
 of me, of -- of -- of course, 
what happened then. Then we started working ag
ain and going back to 
the factory and work 
again. 

Q: Before we go on, I want to as
k you another question about that. 
A: Hm?  

Q: These five boys who were hange
d were not much older than you? 

A: We ll, no, I -- today that certainly wa
sn™t, but they were like 18 or 19 -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- which were much ol
der at the time , you know. 
Q: But did it -- at that point, when you saw th
at happen, did you think then that you could die as 
well?  

A: No. 

Q: It never -- it still -- 

A: It never -- right through the five years, it never occurred
 to me. I don™t know
 why, it just -- 
ma ybe that™s how I am, you know, and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I never thought -- never thought -- 
I thought, one day I™ll be free, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
40 
 
Q: Did you feel fear? 
A: Oh yes. Oh yes, every time, you know, you saw -- even in that camp that we were in, which 

we -- we -- it was considerable better than it
 was in Auschwitz or Stutthof, when we saw a 
German offi cer come  in now, is he going to
 take us away, you know
?  Fear yes, but -- 
Q: Fear -- and what was your wo
rst fear?  If you weren't afraid 
of dying, if that wasn™t -- 
A: I don™t know, I don™t know, just seeing that 
Ge rman was fear enough, you see. But no, and -- 
and then of course, what was happening that the 
Russians are getting nearer again, so they took 
us to another camp. Don™t ask me  where it was,
 but it wasn™t very far from where I was in 
Pome rania. A place called Buschgraben, which 
was a German name , most probabl y it wa -- it 
was still in Poland, so it was -- I don™t know what 
it was called in -- in -- 
in Polish. And there we 
stayed, there we did nothing. We
 had no food, no drink. And the Russians were so near us, the 
Russian soldiers, that at night we
 could hear the music. During th
e day we saw the planes flying 
over, you know, very low and the Russian would sa
y we could -- you could s
ee the pilots in the 
plane. And one sort of afternoon we looked arou
nd and we couldn™t find any Germans. We were 
free. And so we said th-the -- the boys sort of 
my age, you know, said right, let™s go over to the 
Russians, you know. At least we get some  f
ood and drink. But the grownups said you can™t do 
that because they mi ght -- they won™t know who youare, they mi ght kill you, they mi ght shoot at 

you. So we said all right, we went to s -- we we
nt to sleep that night, you know, woke up in the 
morning we were surrounded by the SS troops, by
 the Nazis again. And they were coaches 
waiting for us. 

Q: Coaches? 

A: Yes, ordinary car -- vehicles, you know? 

Q: Cars. [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
41 
 
A: Car -- well, you know, big. Like buses, 
you know?  Luxury buses. And today I cannot 
understand it. They didn™t have e
nough petrol for their soldiers, but
 they had petrol to transport 
Jews. And they said now they™re going to st -- 
again, every time  they™re going to send us to 
Germany. And they said we go back to Danzig. And 
we went back to Stutthof to wait, which was 
even -- there was no gas, there wa -- and there 
was no electricity, there was no water, people are 
dying. But we stayed there only a few days and then
 they said now they™re going to take us to a 
boat and they™re going to put us on 
boats and we ™re going to Denmark. 
Q: So the Germans were going to send you to Denmark? 
A: To den -- yes, well, De nmark was occupied by the -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Germans. 

Q: But what happened -- do you know what happene
d to the Russians?  You thought the Russians 

were so close. 
A: Yes, but they took us away, you know, so mos t
 probably next day the Russians were there, 
they -- they occupied that plac
e. But us they took away. The 
whole camp that was there in 
Buschgraben, and they say -- as I said, they we
re going to take us to Denmark. There wi -- 
everythi ng will be better. And it was already getti
ng late, it was already March, April or so in -- 
in -- so we went to that port a
nd they put us on -- into barges
, like you carry coal, or wheat or 
corn. 

Q: Open on the top? 

A: Open, and there was no watcher [i ndecipherab
le] you know, there was -- I mean, it could be 
closed, they could close the 
hatches, you know, but there was 
nothing on top. There was, well, 
just for you -- just for transporting goods. It wasn
™t a ship, you know, it was -- and they put us in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
42 
 
those barges. And they said we arrive in 
Denmark, everything [indecipherable] I™m s ure 
Denmark was already liberated by then. We  di
dn™t know that. And we were only for about 10 
days, eight to 10 days. 
Q: Did they feed you? 

A: There was no f -- no food, no drink, nothing. It wa
sn™t a question like when we left the ghetto, 
we could take a little bit of f
ood with us. Here we had nothing.  
Q: And you were how many people? 

A: I don™t know exactly, but it was 
more than just one camp, you know. 
Q: It was more than just
 that 20 that were -- 
A: It must have been ab
out a thousand people there. 
Q: Wo w. 

A: You know what -- you know -- but there wasn
™t one barge, there was ma ny barges. You 

know, we also had luck [indecipherable] we had 
some  Norwegian and Danish prisoners of war 
on those barges and they were treated much better
 than us, because they were prisoners of war, 
so they used to get better food. 
They were much more able-bodi
ed people. And that was very 
lucky for us, but anyway, at that time  I already had typhus. I didn™t know then I had typhus, but I 

found out later. Now, you can imagine having an 
illness like typhus, never mi nd me dication, that 
was, of course, out. There was no me dication. Butthere was no water. And I think what saved 

me  again -- it™s funny -- that I was 
so ill that I didn™t drink the sa
lt water, cause I didn™t have a 
chance to get it. A lot of people drank the salt wa
ter, within one day they were dead, because 
they swelled up and they just died. Cause you -- you 
can imagine how much salt there is in that 
water. Now -- 

Q: With typhus do you have a high fever? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
43 
 
A: I should imagine so. 
Q: Right. 

A: A-As far as I know, yes. 

Q: Did you -- were you conscious during this --  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- boat trip. You were awake? 

A: I was almost conscious, semi -conscious, I suppose.
 And after -- I said we were traveling for 
about 10 days and one -- one evening we were very near land and the German -- the troops, the 

SS, the whoever was guarding us got off those barg
es, then we were just alone. But we couldn™t 
have -- we weren™t on land, they we
nt across on little boat
s. So the Norwegians, when I said why 
we were lucky that they [indecipherable] the 
Danish, they said, you know what, if you want to, 
whoever wants to, we will take over onto dry land. 
Because there were st ill little boats left. So 
slowly, right through the night, 
they took every person off, onto land. Some people escaped. 
Well, I wasn™t in a state to escape, I do -- 
I couldn™t walk, never mi nd run. The Germa ns came 
back in the morning and they saw what happened, 
they didn™t put us back
 on the boat. We  are 15 
kilome ters away from a town, which is a naval 
town called Ne ustadt. We  go there, our boat that 
we are -- got to go on it will be waiting for us to go -- 

Q: The German [indecipherable] 

A: -- yeah, to go. So we had to go on a ma rch. And ev -- 

Q: We -- how many people -- 
the Norwegians brought peopl
e over during the night -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and some  of the m just ran and escaped? 

A: Some  of them ran away, I don™
t know how many ran aw
ay. Not that it was important to us -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
44 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know. 

Q: But then the Germans came back to get you -- 

A: Yeah, well they didn™t count us -- 

Q: -- and you were already on land. 

A: -- you know. Whoeve r was there they took away. 
And that was one thing. You had to walk. If 
you fell you were shot on the spot. There was no 
transport and they weren't going to leave you 
there. And they were not going to carry you. So lu
ckily I ha -- I was with friends that I was 
together during all the time s even fr om Poland, 
from the ghetto, through the camps together and 
two of them ma naged to carry me  -- sort of 
half carry, half walk and some how, don™t ask me  
how, I don™t know, once again I survived and we a
rrived eventually. If we started a thousand 
people, we mi ght have finished up about 
three, 400, the rest fell and were shot. 
Q: How long did this take?   
A: I don™t know exactly, but it took hours and ho
urs. And it was only anot
her 50 kilome ters, like 
10 miles. Shouldn™t have take -- well, to a able
 bodied person it wouldn™
t have taken that long. 
Anyway they -- we arrived at the place and it 
was a port and it was a boat waiting for us. That™s 
th -- the only time they told us
 the truth. It was a proper ship
, a liner, you know?  Atlantic ocean 
liner, it wasn™t some  little ship. And there was al
ready a transport of people from other camps on 
that ship. We didn™t know then, but the re --
 we found out, because th
ere were planes going 
around and we knew it couldn™t be German planes. 
We  didn™t know whether they were Russians, 
Americans or British. It turned out they were 
British planes, and all of a sudden they started 
bombing. And they hit that boat, but they didn™t
 hit it that it was completely dama ged, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
45 
 
and they started -- people started shouting, scr
eaming that we™re on the boat. That™s how we 
found out that there were other people on the -- 

Q: So you saw the boat you were on? 

A: Oh yes, we were just in front, like in front
 waiting to go on it. But they couldn™t do it because 
of the -- the bombing. And the 
people started screaming and ju
mping into the water and of 
course some  of them drowned, you know. And we
 were waiting and waiting, waiting and it took 
-- must have been at least a half an hour and 
then it stopped, so we di
dn™t know whether they -- 
everybody was already jumped off or they were d
ead, whatever it was. And then about av -- 10 
mi nutes, 20 mi nutes later, we heard people s
houting again, but it was different. They were 
waving things. We  couldn™t understand what was ha
ppening. And then all of a sudden we looked 
around and we didn™t see any Germa ns. We  were 
surrounded by the British army tanks. That was 
the third of May, 1945. And I went over to the -- to
 the tank and the first th
ing -- he was talking 
to me  in English and I didn™t know what he 
was saying, you know. And the only thing I kept on 
saying is in -- in German, wasser, wasser. You 
know, wasser, he must have understood wasser, 
water, you know and he gave me  some  water. Th
is is the first water 
I drunk after 10 days. And 
not only that I drunk after 10 days, as a free ma
n, you know. I don™t think I appreciated the free, 
you know, because I didn't  know, and of course then 
they threw me  a little parcel as well, and I 
ma naged to hide it. A usual thing, I thought 
no, everybody™ll want it, 
and it was true, everybody 
wanted [indecipherable] they didn™t
 realize that we are free, that 
we can get food as much as we 
want. And they -- straight away some others
 came and some  people could speak German, you 
know, some  people -- British 
soldiers. And you know, they said you are free now, you can do 
whatever you want, you can go around. You can r
ope, you can steal, you can kill, do whatever 
you want. Well, of course, being 
Jewish and being a child, all we
 were interested was to get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
46 
 
food. And this, to a certain extent, I wish they wo
uldn™t have done that, I wish they would have 
kept us and put us in -- some where in a camp an
d give us food. Not tell us that we can go and 
take whatever we want, because I would imagine 
that the first month of t he liberation, more 
people died than in previous months purely from overeating. You 
couldn™t -- our stomachs 
couldn™t take it. And here we were just eati
ng for the sake of it, you know, we couldn't -- we 
were right up to our necks in food, you know. 
We were eating meat and jam and cheese, 
everything together. And the British were so goo
d to us, you know. Every time they -- they used 
to come  in, they -- first of all they said to 
us, go and live wherever you want. We , a fe w of us 
found a prison. So we thought we™l
l stay there. But not where 
the prisoners -- there was no 
prisoners, but where the guards must have slept, 
you know, and that was first time  in years of so 
white sheets, you know, and -- and of cour --  
Q: Let™s take a little break -- 

A: Sorry. 
Q: -- I™m sorry, we have to change tapes. 
We™ll come back to th
e -- to the prison, okay. 
A: Do you un -- 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: So it™s m -- it™s May of 1945, and you™re in -- 
A: Yes, third of May, 1945, and I™m -- 

Q: -- Neustadt. 

A: In Neustadt which is [i ndecipherable] 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Which is not far from Lübeck on one side a
nd Oldenburg on the other side, and even not that 
far, it™s about a hundred kilome te
rs from -- roughly from Ha mburg. 
Q: And the British ha ve said to you that you can go and -- 

A: And do whatever I want, yes. 

Q: -- do whatever you wa nt to do. 

A: We  were free. We  could do -- and unfortu -- 
well, not -- I suppose unfor
tunately, there were 
also some  Russians from the -- not prisoner of 
war, also inma tes like us, on the boats, you know, 
and they did commit a lot of crimes, unfortunately.  

Q: What kind of crimes?  

A: We ll, the natural thing wa
s rape, you know, rape and murder and stealing and -- we  were 
stealing, well, in a way we di
dn™t think we were stealing, th
e food was there in the open. 
Q: And the people were there who ow
ned the stor es or the market -- 
A: No, no, no, it wasn™t -- 

Q: -- or they were bombed? 

A: -- it was -- it was a naval port. 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
48 
 
A: And -- and the -- the -- th
e marines, the German Marine
s weren™t there, you know, the 
German Navy wasn™t there. It was open, it 
was -- nobody was there, you know, you could take 
whatever you wanted, you know, and like I said, you 
know and I slept in that prison with white 
sheets for the first time in my life, you know. Bu
t the funny thing was I woke up in the morning, 
I -- I didn™t have a bath or a s
hower even then, I mean, this wa
s the least of my problems, you 
know. Food was the only problem. And got up -- but 
when I got up in the morning I looked at 
my sheet and it looked so dirty, and I said, we
ll, it must be from my body, you know, I -- I -- I 
haven™t washed for -- for -- for days and days, 
for weeks. And the same  clothes, there was no 
other clothes. Only one shirt, one pair of
 boots, you know, which were wooden clogs. And I 
looked at it and then -- then I sa
w things were moving and then I re
alized that it was lice. And of 
course, I was covered completely with lice. Y
ou know, but this didn™t ma tter, you know, as long 
as I had food. And every morning, you know, they 
-- the British troops, soldiers were comi ng 
and with the Red Cross vans and they said a
nybody that wants to go hospital, and you know, and 
I ne -- I -- some how my t yphus didn™t sort of 
exist any more, you know. And -- but I™m sure I 
was still very, very ill, and -- but
 I laughed. I said, why do they want
 to take us to the hospital?  
Now we™ve got everything. Everything in life was f
ood. That™s the only thing we are orientated. 
Three days later when they came I said I woul
d like to go to hospital, but I won™t ma na ge 
because whatever I had came  down, came out of me
. And they took me  to a hospital in Neustadt. 
I was -- they took away my clothes, I was -- had 
nothing and -- and then th -- they put me  to bed. 
And I, even now I was -- I was very, very ill.
 I was -- I don™t know wh
at was wrong with me, I 
wa -- but I was semi conscious. And do you know 
-- and they asked me , do you want anything? 

And don™t ask me  why, the only thin
g I wanted is salami . It™s ju
st one of those stupid things 
when I think of it today. Well, of course I didn™t 
get that [indecipherable] they put me  to bed and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
49 
 
for three months I was in the hospital you know, 
when -- when I was already okay, I couldn™t get 
out of bed, I couldn™t walk. 
Q: You were so weak. 

A: I was t -- yeah, I couldn't -- they had to
 teach me  to walk, you know. And you know tha -- I 
said, what is wrong with me , they said not
hing. What was wrong with me?  Also nothing, you 
had typhus when you came in but otherwise th
ere™s absolutely nothing wrong, but you know -- 
and I reme mber such stupid thing, I couldn™t 
walk. But when I was in bed, you know, and the -- 
the -- the -- there was the American people were co
mi ng in fr om Joint, the American jo -- Joint -- 
Q: Joint Distribution Committee, mm-hm. 

A: Yeah, and they were bringi
ng us chocolates and cigarettes
 you know, so -- and you know that 
-- that mi nd that work, that -- th
at -- to steal, you know. So of c
ourse you didn™t steal, you didn™t 
have to steal, but wo -- we were doing, you know, 
the -- I mean, I was only -- I didn't need it, 
you know, I had enough food in the hospital. But when 
they came , to -- to the children they gave 
chocolates. To the grownup that were there they ga
ve cigarettes. So of course when they -- the 
people that -- with the chocolat
es ha -- came, so I was there, sitting up in bed and I took the 
chocolate. When I knew the people with the ci
garettes are comi ng, I covered myself over the 
head. And they asked, who is there, I says, oh, ther
e™s a man there, so they left me cigarettes, you 
know, that -- that mi nd that wo
rks, you know, it™s -- it™s -- 
Q: You just needed to keep th
ings, you just couldn™t give up. 
A: Oh, keep thing is not, it didn™t ma tter, I ha
d to put -- have things, you know. We ll eventually 
they said yes, you™ll be able to go out. I said
 yes, that™s all very good. I™ve got no clothes. 
Q: How did you communicate with the British at that time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
50 
 
A: Oh, there were -- there were already -- first of
 all, after a few months
, the German nurses were 
doing everything and I spoke Germa n t -- you know
, I spoke Yiddish and a bit of German, you 
know, mi xed it up. They understood. 
And some  of the soldiers ev
en, you see, the ones that 
liberite -- that liberated us went
 -- carried on fighting, you know. So the -- the ones that came in 
were different already and there were some  soldie
rs that  could speak Polish, there were soldiers 
that coul d speak Yiddish, there were Je wish so
ldiers, so there was no problem. So -- and the 
thing was that it was already thre
e months after the liberation, so the -- the -- the German nurses 
already were girlfriends of British soldiers, you 
se e?  So she sa id to me , I try to get you 
some thing to wear, one of the nurses and she 
brought me  a British uniform, you know. I said, 
that™s very ni ce, but I me an, I™m a little boy, I 
mean, it™ll be  too big. Anyway, don™t worry and 
they shortened it for me . And I came  out of hospital 
and some  friends of mi ne that I was with in 
the camps said oh, we going to a di splaced person camp. Which was a camp where we had where 

to live, where we used to get 
enough food. They they said, you know
, there is -- I think now the 
British governme nt is allowing a thousand children to come  to England. The Swedish 

governme nt is allowing a thousand children to go 
to Sweden. And we can also go to Pa lestine 
because Palestine -- we can™t go as such, just 
say right, we going, because there is a quota, 

because they said, according to the British 
governme nt, because it was under the British 

protection, British mandate, that it 
wouldn™t be fair to the other population to send all the people 
that want to go to Israel in one
 go. So every month groups will go. I said okay. But I definitely -- 
so, we sat down, we thought Sweden, England, it
 must be about 50,000 miles away. I said, what 

will we go to England, we know nobody. No, let™s st
ay and go to Palest ine. I said, I™ve got 

nobody in England, I™ve got nobody anywhere else as 
far as I know. And I sa
id right, we™ll do 
that. So we stayed in the displaced person camp, th en we went to a -- ab -- about 10 miles away 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
51 
 
to a children™s home, and there were a few grow
n up people there, Jewish people and they kept 
on teaching us a little bit, you know. And --  
Q: Teaching, you mean English?  

A: Eng -- no, no. English was unimportant, we 
didn™t need to know English. You know, we 
weren™t going to England, it wa
s in ger -- I was in Germany so
 we learnedHebrew mainly, you 
know, because going to Palestine and then they said
 all the kids that go to Palestine will go to 
Ha mburg. And in Hamb urg we were at -- they sent
 us there, so I said, let™s go to Hamburg. It 
was a beautiful place. It was donated by the Varber
ek family, which was a Jewish fami ly, Jewish 
bankers that when the war broke out in Germany 
they went to live in Sw
itzerland and some  went 
to live in England, you know. So we
 stayedthere, then 
I got ill, I needed an operation. So again 
they sent me  to the hospital, I had the operation. 
Of course there was no anesthetic at the time, 
but -- 

Q: What was it -- what was it for? 
A: I ruptur ed myself -- 
Q: Oh. 

A: -- you know. It la -- it was -- I can™t tell you how it happened, you know, cause I™m too 

embarrassed. 

Q: Okay.  

A: Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to look some wher
e where I shouldn™t have done, you know, being 
15 years old, you™re very inquisitive. And I -- bu
t anyway, so I went to
 hospital and had the 
operation. Then two friends came to me  and --with a letter. And th
e letter was from London, 
England. And I s -- who would write to me  fr
om England?  I don™t 
know anybody in England. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
52 
 
look, and you know, the usual thing, I look at the 
back, there was a retu
rn address, London. And 
it give a name , it means absolutely nothing to me , and -- 
Q: Do you reme mber what the name  was? 

A: Oh yes, I reme mber it very well. I™ ll come to it in a mi nute. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And -- so my friend went up to [indeciphera
ble] and says, why the hell don™t you open the 
letter and you™ll know who it™s from and who is 
writing to you. And I open the letter and it sa ys, 
written in Polish, you know, my na me  is so and so 
and I left Poland in the 30™s -- it™s a woma n -- 

and I had a son in Poland, same  age as you and 
I -- I found that name  on the British Red Cross 
list in London. She even says where, in Woburn H
ouse. The only thing, the y
ear of the -- of the -
- the birth is different. It sa
ys that Zygmund Shipper, born 18
th
 of January, 1931, and I know that 
my son was born in 1930. And she says, but if you ha
ve a look at your left 
wrist, as a child of 
about three or four you burnt your
self and there should still be
 a ma rk there. And you know, I 
didn™t even think of the ma rk. I knew I had a mark
 because it was very -- you could see it very 
easily. But of course, today you can just about see it.  

Q: Right there, yeah. 

A: And you know, and I looked at th
at and I found my mother, that
 I knew that she was dead for 
over 10 years. As a child of five
 I knew my mother was dead. At 
least that™s what I thought. And 
here a woma n found me  and she says she is my 
mother. The funny thing is I -- I -- tears come  
down now. When I actually knew about it, it didn™t m
ean that much to me. And of course, in the 
letter she says, if I™m your mother I -- I want
 you to come  to England to be with me , you know, 
and -- and I said to -- I turned 
around to my friends and -- you 
know, and I said, I don™t know the 
woma n. She  doesn™t mean anything to me . I me
a n, you are my fa mily. You are -- you two are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
53 
 
my brothers. She is a stranger to me . And of course, you know, they said, how can you say that, 
you know. And when I came out of hospital an-and 
went back and the teacher there, we had 
teachers from the Jewish brigade, that were teac
hing us Hebrew and we had lessons in -- in -- in 
ma th and whatever else, German, I™m not 
sure, history or so on. And everybody said -- 
everybody was talking about the in
cident and they said you found your mother, how can you not 
-- you™re one of the luckiest 
people alive that you™ve got so
me body, a mo ther, and we™ve got 
nothing. You must go to your mother. Anyway, they
 persuaded me  and it t
ook about -- at that 
time I couldn™t go, just go, she had to get a visa for me , and it took 10 months to get a visa, you 

know. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: Oh yes, it -- or even longer. Than happened 
in January and I think -- 
and I came to England in 
December -- 22
nd
 or 23
rd
 of Dece mbe r  1946. And I arrived -- I 
came on a boat, I arrived in Hull. 
A ma n me t me , and he s a id to me  in Yiddish, beca
use I couldn™t speak English, he says -- when I 
came off the boat he says, if you™ve got your things, get your luggage and we will go on the 

train, we™ll go to London. I looked at him and 
I be -- start laughing. He says, why are you 
laughing?  I said, what luggage?  Y
ou see what I™ve got. I was -- I 
was -- when I was in Ha mburg 
I was very friendly with a girl and the only reason
 -- reason I was so friend
ly with her is because  
I had one shirt and I had -- needed
 some body to wash my shirt. Wh
en she washed my shirt I had 
to stay inside because I had no other shirt to 
wear. And he talks to me  about luggage. Anyway, 
he turned out to be my stepfather, my  mother 
rema rried. And that™s what
 I said to you I™ll tell 
you the name, it was Killberg. And eventually we came home and you know, we -- I arrived and 

my mother cried, and ma de me  cry as well, but I s
till didn™t feel anything towards her at the time, 

you know?  And the first six months I didn™t go to 
work, I did nothing, but it was the worst -- one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
54 
 
of the worst times in my life. I 
thought my wer -- bad times have finished but they were bad, I 
had nobody. My fa mily was in Germany, waiting to go to Palestine. 
Q: Let me  a sk you a question about the time, that 
year that you spent waiting to go to England. 
What did you do, and what did you think about?  
I mean, did you -- and did you write to your 
mother, did you -- 

A: Oh, yes. 

Q: -- get caught up and so -- 

A: I wrote. Yeah, not as often 
ma ybe as I should have done, but 
I did write, and what did I do?  
We had school. And you know, we were outside Ha
mburg and we -- we had a time of our lives, 
you know. We had money to burn. We -- we -- we used
 to get Red Cross parc
els that were sent 
during the war for the American prisoners of wa
r. And there were mount ains of those. And -- 
and you know, we used to -- and in the parcel ther e was two pa -- a parcel for two people, so we 

used to share it. There was Nescafe, I™ll never see Nescafe. There was -- there was prunes, there 
was sugar, there was chocolate. And of course 
the most i mportant thing was the Nescafe and a 
pack of 200 cigarettes. Not that we smoked, but we
 could buy things with them. If we wanted to 
go to a theater, you know, to see an opera -- 
I mean, I never knew what an opera was -- we -- 
there was no tickets, you couldn™t ge
t. But when you put a packet of
 cigarettes at the desk where 
they were selling -- where the -- 
the ticket thing was, then you st
raight away got tickets, and 
coffee as well. We  used to go to the fa rms, you know, Ger ma n far ms, and you know, exchange a 

tin of Nescafe, those small tins at  the time, whic
h cames in the parcel, for some  eggs or some  
ham, or wha t ever we wanted, I mean -- 

Q: Wa s Nescafe ground coffee? 

A: You know -- yes, you know, the tin
s. You™ve got it here, you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526

Q: Yeah, I just didn™t know -- 
A: -- the -- the --  

Q: -- if it was the same  thing, the -- 

A: -- the ready ma de, you know, spoon cof -- 

Q: -- inst ant coffee. 

A: -- coffee -- inst ant coffee, that™s right.  

Q: Yes. 

A: But it was Nescafe, it™s the same  as today in
 England. I™m sure you™ve got it here. Anyway, so 
we were -- excuse me  [ta pe break] Yes, and it 
was carrying on like that. I was with them. They 
didn™t say you™ve got to leave becau
se you™re not going to Palestine, 
so I stayed with them and --  
Q: [indecipherable] you stay, yeah. 

A: -- til -- til we went, you know. 
I didn™t want to go, right up til th
e last mi nute I didn™t want to 
go. But anyway I came, like I said, and for the firs
t six months I didn™t do any work, all I did was 
go to cinema s. I™ve never seen a film before in
 my life. Now I certainly ma de up in those six 
months. And then one day they -- some body ca me  
to me  and said, you know, there is a club that 
young Holocaust survivors, boys and 
girls meet in a certain area in
 London in Belsize Park, as it 
happens, and why don™t you go there one day?  On a 
Saturday night they™vegot a dance, so why 
don™t you go?  I said all right, so
 I decided I™ll go, you know, so I 
arrived at the door, you know, 
it -- they had a dance in a church hall. I knoc
ked on the door and they opened. And I said some  
words then that I -- in the book what -- what Si
r Martin Gilbert wrote ab
out us, the boys that 
came here -- that came  to England,. and I said 
-- the first thing I said 
when th -- I opened the 
door, I found my fa mily again. That™s what they 
meant to me , more than my mother. And from 

then on, my life completely changed, you know. I jo
ined the club straight away and I spent more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
56 
 
time in the club than anywhere else. I got a job, 
my mother said and my stepfather said every 
person should have a trade. What would you like to do
?  I said, I haven™t got a clue what I want to 
do. My mot her said, would you like to go to sch
ool and [indecipherable]. I say, I™m t oo old for 
school. At 17 I was -- I can™t go back to school, you know, I sort of -- so they said, what about 
tailoring? I said okay. So I went to t-tailoring. I 
worked in tailoring for about six or seven years 
and I must tell you I hated every mi nute of it. By 
then I already found th -- 
in that club, a refugee 
girl as well, but they came in 1939, she came with
 her parents to England. We  started dating, you 
know, and I said to he r, do you know what?  The day 
the man will say that I™m a qualified tailor, 
this will be the day I give up tailoring and I™ll 
never hold a needle in my
 hand. And I kept to it. 
He said, now you can -- he says, you™ll have mo
re money. I said, thank you very muc h, but now 
I™m leaving the job. And going back 
to that girl, we started going 
out together. Eventually we got 
ma rried. And I opened a delicatessen business, that
 didn™t go very well ev
entually. So she said, 
you know, my father is in business, but if you go 
in, you can go much bigger in the business, we 
-- why don™t you go in?  And the fath
er said, why don™t you come  in with me , and I did. It was a 
stationery and printing business. An
d eventually, after a few years, 
I left him and he retired and I 
got bigger and I did wholesale, I had my own 
print place. I had reta
il shops in London. But you 
know my mother -- going back to my mother
, you know, I realized th
en, you know, when I got 
ma rried I realized, you know, ther
e must -- she must have had a good reason why she left. You 
know, things are not so ha -- black and white. 
I realize people do get divorced, you know. But I 
regret -- I™ve got a regret, that 
-- I™ve got very few regrets, but 
one regret is -- which you did ask 
me, and I never asked my mother til she die
d, and she died, unfortunately, very young, why?  
What was the reason? And up to today I don™
t know the reason, you know, why she left, for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
57 
 
what, whether there was another 
person involved, or whether she 
just couldn™t live with my 
father, or vice versa. I don™t know. 
Q: [coughs] Excuse me . I want to a -- I™m glad
 you brought up your father because during this 
time, while you were in the -- in
 the ghetto, in the camps, you di
dn't know what had happened to 
your father. You never heard from your father? 

A: No. 

Q: Did you -- w-w-when you were finally liberat
ed, was it on your mi nd to try and go to Poland 
or find out about anybody in Pola
nd, or was that a possibility? 
A: Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very, 
very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young -- 
youngsters wanted to go back to Poland. Don™t as
k me  why. I -- when I think back today I don™t 
know why. But unfortunately some  of
 them went back and we re killed by the Poles. You see, the 
Poles were very scared of the Jewish people co
mi ng back and trying to claim their properties. I 
mean, those people lived in those pr operties for five years, and all of a sudden a Jew will come 
and take their properties away. They were beat
en, they were killed in ma ny, ma ny places. There 
was a pogrom in Kielce, you know, in Poland, wher
e they killed a lot of Jewish people, you 
know, because they were terrified that they™re go
ing to take away their home s. I can understand 
that, you know. Why they should kill, I don™t know
. They didn™t have to kill them not to give 
them back their homes, but they did. I -- I aske
d questions, you know, but 
I didn™t look properly 
til years later, you know, but like I said, you know, 
I was in business and I got ma rried in 1954. 
In 1956 my wife became  pregnant. Oc tober -- the ei
ghth of October I went  to the hospital, she 
was in labor. And I will never forget that mo me
nt, it was the happiest mo ment in my l i fe, you 
know. And you know, when I walked in -- because at 
that time  there wasn™t such a thing as a 
husband watching the birth of a child, you know, and 
that woma n presented me  with that bundle, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
58 
 
and I looked at it and I couldn™t 
stop crying. And I said, at last, 
I know I™ve got a family of my 
own, you know. When I look at that 
child, it was the greatest thing, 
that whenever I say that and 
my younger daughter is there -- because a few y
ears later I had another 
daughter, she says, Dad, 
what about me , you know. And she knows how much 
I love both of them, there is absolutely no 
different. But you know, it did some thing to me
, you know, that I cannot explain, you know. I 
know that every parents is -- it™s 
the most happiest day of their li
fe when their child is born. But 
the Holocaust survivor, when he™s
 lost almost everythi ng -- I mean
 some of my friends, they™ve 
got -- they had fa milies, they had si blings a
nd they™ve got not one me mber of the fa mily 
survived, you know. You know, and I was lucky e
nough that my mother survived. Unfortunately 
-- I mean, she was lucky enough to see grandchild
ren, you know, which was 
a great thing for me  
and for her. And unfortunately I 
think she died thinking 
that I™ve never forgiven her for leaving 
me . And when we discussed it, a
nd I used to -- about leaving me
, she never said why and I never 
asked, but I said, if you would have stayed, most
 probably both of us would have been dead 
today. So, at least both of us survived. And I 
certainly did -- did not hold it against her. You 
know, I did, most probably as a child, but in late
r years, you know, when I came  to England, you 
know, it never crossed my mi nd that she™s guilty 
of some thing. And she got on better with my 
wife than she got on with me  because  she had it in 
the back of her mi nd that I must hate her, or -- 
and I know, I -- I -- I loved her as much as I co
uld, you know. I™m sure I didn™t love her as a 
normal child will love a mother, you know. But I didlove her, I respected her, you see? But then, 

as I said, I had children, and eventually they 
grew up. Good kids. They produced three children 
each. You know, I™ve got six grandchildren and 
I think how lucky I am, you know. In 1981, I -- 
unfortunately I did work very hard, you know?  I 
also played very hard, you know. I -- I smoke 
and I drunk and I goed -- went to ca
sinos and I -- I -- I went to foot
ball, I did everything. I wasn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
59 
 
a father like I -- I even apologi
zed to my two daughters for not being a father like I should have 
been. They don™t think so, but you know. But today 
they think I™m the gr
eatest thing alive. I 
don™t know why, you know. They are wonderful, wonde
rful kids. And when I think I came  to 
England, without education I coul
dn™t read and write. Never mi nd 
English, I couldn™t hardly read 
and write in Polish. And the -- my oldest grands
on has a master™s degr ee in mathematics and 
statistics. From a poor little boy to come  to th
is country, to meet he
r Majesty the Queen and 
shake hands with her. To meet 
the prime mi nister of this count
ry and go to his place where he 
lives and where he works, why me ?  In 1981, as I sa
id, I worked very hard. 
I had to go to hospital 
and they sent me  home , t hey said there™s not
hing wrong. Four hours later 
I was in hospital again 
with a hear t attack and they
 -- I think it™s cutting out. 
Q: Okay, we™ll take 
a break, all right? 
A: I™m nearly finished anyway. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
60 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: I™d like to go back and ask you about this gr
oup of survivors that you me t six months after 
you came to London, and -- and I™d like to just t-talk
 a little bit more about who they were and 
what kinds of things you did together, and you -- di
d -- just -- just give me
 a little bit of better 
sense of what that gr
oup of people was like. 
A: You see, they™re a group of re
tired soldiers, they were the ones that  came here in -- between 
August 1945, and sort of end of 1947. But tha -- on the 14
th
 of August 1945 was the first lot that 
came here from Theresienstadt concentration cam
p. They were there -- they were liberated in 
Theresienstadt, then they went to Prague and fr
om Prague they came to 
England. Originally they 
came to the north of England to a beautiful
 place called Wi nderme re. And I don™t know the 
reason why they brought them there,
 but people think it™s because th
ey we re scared to bring them 
into a capital like London or Manc
hester, because they didn™t know
 who they were bringing in 
here. They are bringing young people that were five
 years interned. Now, how are they going to 
behave?  Now, within a few months they di
spersed them, they sent them t o London and 
Manchester, Liverpool and so on. Now, the peopl
e that I me t, of course, they were the 
Londoners. 
Q: Now, who is they? Who brought them?  

A: They Central British Fund, which Leonard Mont
efiore was the head of Central British Fund, 
it was a charity, and they brought them to 
England, they supplied teachers and doctors. 
Everything was supplied by Central British Fund. They 
even paid for the transpor t, they paid for 

everything. The governme nt allowed a thousand ch
ildren, but the governme nt
 didn™t pay for it, 
the Central British Fund paid.  

Q: And it was a non-governmental organization? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
61 
 
A: Yes, completely charity. Wa s a complete charity organization, they™re 
still in existence now, 
but they -- they amalgamated with the big char it
ies, they are not any more the Central British 
Fund, the Jewish [indecipherable] this -- this-- the whole thing i
nvolved, you know. And they 
had homes, you know, for the survivors and for ref
ugees that came before  the war to Britain, you 
see?  And that group that I was with is the group 
that came. They were -- they were survivors 
originally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. 
Very, very few from Germany, but they were 
all a mi xture of [indecipherable]. And we -- we 
came  -- and when they came  to London they 
lived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF
 decided that they should for m a club to keep 
the youngsters together. And they formed a club a
nd it was like any other club. We  did a lot of 
sport. One of our me mbe r s, which today is th
e chairman of our society, which after the club 
finished we for med a society, became British 
lightweight champion in weightlifting. Now hi m 
they ma de British very quickly because he 
was very good. He represented England in the 
Olympic games, in the commonwealth games and 
of course in the Maccabee in Israel. And we 
had -- and so me went to college, some went to university. So me became doctors, lawyers. You 
know, we had one who was working in -- in unive
rsity as a lecturer, you know, and so -- well, 
actually two. One was a ma the matician, you know, a
nd we did -- they did quite well. And most 
of them went to trades or business, and -- and --
 but the most important thing was that because of 
the club, we kept together. Now, eventuall
y, you know, we got ma rried and had children, we 
couldn™t have  a club, because it wouldn™t work, because we wouldn™t ha ve time to go to a club. 

And we -- you couldn™t carry on playing football, 
basketball, cricket and 
so on. We had other -- 
we had to work and we had to look after families.
 So they decided to form a society, which we 
still got up til today, which is called the 45 Aid 
Society, I think I toldyou that. We  raise money 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
62 
 
for charity, for eng -- in England and in Israel, 
ma inly for children. Because we feel we were 
children when it happened to us
, we want to help children. 
Q: Is it just  for Jewish children? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, in England it™s -- whoeve
r approaches us, we try to give. 
But of course, in
 -- in Israel 
it is for children. We  -- we have been giving 
to a home  for deaf children, you know, for -- for oh, 
for about 30 years now, if not longer. And we 
fee l  we should, you know, and -- and also, I think, 
because of that, having had a club and then having 
this society, which we look after also our own 
me mbers, if they need help, we are there. They
™ve got some body to turn 
to, because they™ve got 
no other families. Of course, they got ma rried an
d have got their childre
n and grandchildren. But 
otherwise they™ve got nobody. They got no brothers
 or sisters, so -- or very few have.  
Q: When you -- when you found this group, six m
onths after you arrived, how ma ny pe ople were 
there wi -- more or less? 

A: Oh, I wouldn™t like to say, but there must have
 been at least about oh -- me mbers, about 400. 
Q: Oh really, that ma ny? 

A: Yeah, but, you see, a lot of them went to
 the United States, Canada, Australia, a few 
Switzerland. And of course, you s
ee we are scattered all over Brita
in. Like, in Manchester we™ve 
got some  me mbers and of -- we™ve 
got a lot of members that were then in Israel  ar e now -- that 
wer -- are now in Israel were originally in En
gland, and some of them -- in 1948, or ™47 and ™48, 
they decided to go and fight in the War of Inde
pendence when the state of Israel was born. Some  

came back. Those that w -- came back, had to come
 back within a year, 
otherwise they wouldn™t 
have been let into Britain. And some
 of them didn™t want to come  
back, and they stayed in Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
63 
 
And we™ve got quite a big grou -- well, not a bi
g group, but a biggish gro
up in Israel of those 
people. So much so that this year we had 
our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every 
Sunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, b
ecause most of the people are liberated in that 
time. So, we  have a fa -- a reunion of ever
ybody. People come from the States, people come  
from Israel. This year nobody came from Israel, 
the reason being that a lot of the people in 
England went to Israel on the sixth and seventh 
of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in 
Israel, the Israeli people put
 on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60
th
 anniversary of 
the birth of the state of Israel, so
 they went. So we™re a very close 
fa mily and I think this helped a 
lot, because when you think that very few of us 
of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or 
being counseled -- I don™t know anybody who was 
counseled through the y
ears, because we had 
such a family, we had. And a lot of survivors that
 were in England or in Britain, I should say, 
needed help because they were on their own. 
And you know, they didn™t have anybody. Like my 
children -- I mean, I never had a brother, never 
had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles 
and aunts. And up til toda y, they call my friends
, ma ny of them, I me an it™s, it™s not everybody, 
uncle or aunt . You see, because this -- 
I think this helped us a hell of a lot. 
Q: Of course. 

A: You see -- 

Q: Let me  a s k you also about your grandmothe
r. You said goodbye to her as you were being 
taken away -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- to go and work in this railro
ad yard, with thos
e other young me n.  
A: Well, this was the last  time, of course, I sa
w my grandmother, and -- and this is one of my 
ma in regrets, you know, that I didn™t have a chan
ce, you know, to thank her for what she did for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
64 
 
me, to bringing me up. I™m sure it wasn™t eas
y, you know, but there was nobody else that could 
help me at the time, only her. And she was like a 
mother to me. And what I am today, I owe it to 
her. And unfortunately, a few years ago -- well, 
quite a while ago now, I found out that she died 
in Theresienstadt, but she died
 on the day of the liberation. 
Q: She got moved to Theresienstadt? 

A: Yes, all of them finished up in Theresiens
tadt  from Stutthof, because Stutthof was overrun 
very quickly by the Russians. And 
she finished up in Theresiens
tadt and she died out -- on the 
day of the liberation. That means she didn™t even 
have one day to say, well I survived the war 
and ma ybe my grandson survived the war, ma ybe my
 son s urvived the war, or sons, I should say. 
Which one did. You see, my father -- the other 
regret is, I don™t know when, I don™t know where 

my father died. And I would have liked to have
 gone -- I™m not religious
, but I would like to go 
and stand in front of his gr
ave and say Kaddish for him, and you know, to say a prayer, you 
know, and -- and that™s
 about all, but -- 
Q: You don™t know anything about where he died? 

A: Nothing.  

Q: Nothing. 

A: I™ve been to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem ye
ars ago and I tried to find out, I couldn™t find 
anything out. I -- I tried ever
ything you know, and those are th
e only regrets. Otherwise, I 
consider myself one of the luckiest people aliv
e. Listen, I survived all that. I -- in 1981, 

unfortunately I had to go to hospital because th
ought I was -- I -- I thought I was a heart attack, 
but they finished up saying me , I had -- it™s no
thing. Four hours later I was back in hospital 
having had a heart attack. And but they said, well, 
it™s -- it™s a mild one, we
™ll keep you here for 
three, four days and then you can go home . I sa id, thank you very much. They took me up to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
65 
 
coronary care unit. I was there, my wife came in
 and for some reason when she walked in, must 
have been two hours after they brought me  in, I 
started speaking in Yiddish, not in English. And 
I said to her in Yiddish, you know
, I -- I don™t think this is a 
good business being here. And the 
next thing I know I had six doctors around me
. And one of them said, do you know what 
happened to you?  I said, I was talk
ing to my wife and I must have fallen asleep. When I said the 
word sleep, I realized -- I was c
onscious enough then to realize that
 I didn™t fall 
asleep, that I 
must have gone, you know, and they resuscitate
d me . And then later I found out, you know, they 
told my wife  and my two daughters, who were th
ere already, that my chances of surviving were 
nil, you know. That the -- the next 24 hours and 
they said go home  and pr
ay. And my wife said, 
you know the Germans tried five years to kill him 
and they didn™t succeed. So -- and all I can tell 
you, three weeks later I walked out without me
dication. And that was 27 years ago. I don™t know 
how I™m goi ng -- how long I™m going to live, but I 
certainly survived 24 h
ours. And I ask again, 
why?  Why did I escape such a lot of incidents,
 such a lot of -- the gas chambers, a ma ssive 
coronary? I don™t know, I can™t, 
you know, there™s no answer to 
that. But I cannot thank enough 
the British people what they did for me, fi rst of all they liberat ed me. They let me come into their 
country and I could do whatever I wanted, I had no
 restriction of move ment, I had no restriction 
of business, I could open any business I wante
d, you know?  So I am thankful to them. I™m 
thankful -- if there is a God, I 
thank God for wha t  happened to me
 and I had a very good life.  
Q: Are you a religious person?  
Do you attend synagogue?  Do -- 
A: I am not a religious person. I go to synagogue 
twice a year on new year, Rosh Hashanah and 
Yom Kippur . This is what I go, it™s nothing to 
do -- as far as I™m con
cerned it™s nothing to do 
with religion, because I sit down 
and I think of my family and what happened to them, and of 
course my grandparents were very religious, so 
I owe them that, you know. 
And I -- as I st -- as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
66 
 
you reme mb er, I said that I was brought up in a ve
ry religious home , but 
unfortunately after the 
war, you know, when I asked questions, I couldn™t
 accept the answ
ers that were given to me  
when I asked like a foolish 15 year old, I asked qu
estions that there were no answers to that. But 
the question the rabbis gave 
me, I wouldn™t accept. And I -- 
Q: What was the question and 
what was the [indecipherable] 
A: Well, I ask why. The thing I™m ask that 
everybody ask. Wh y. I said okay, grown-up people I 
can understand. I mean, people committed so many things against pe ople, against God, they were 

punished for it. But a six month old baby being vi
olated, put in a gas chamber?  No, I couldn™t 
accept the answer and I was very, very much agains
t religion, so much so when it came  to Yom 
Kippur, which is, you know, we got to fast 25 hours, we
 mu - -  all we are allowed to do is to pray, 
I used to eat twice as much as normal that day. I 
used to go to football, I used to go to dog racing, 
I used to do everything, I -- I hated the reli
gion so much. But you know -- because, you know, 

like everybody else wif -- you always blame 
God for good or bad, you know?  And then I thought 
-- you know, you get older, you™ve got a family 
and you start thinking. We ll, I cannot tell 
anybody that there is a God and nobody can te
ll me  there is no God. I don™t know, and nobody 
else knows. We -- we think we know. But what 
I cannot understand, why, if
 there is a God, why 
do we blame  God for everything? We  are the people
 that doing all those th
ings. God doesn™t tell 
us. It doesn™t say anywhere God tell us to kill people, to let people starve. You see, I -- I mean, 

six million Je ws alone were killed, for no reason. 
One and a half million children were killed. 
And not only Jews were killed. The Gypsy populat
ion of -- of Europe was almost wiped out. 
Homosexuals were killed. Disabl
ed people were killed, including 
German disabled people. And 
it™s only us that doing it, it™
s not God. When I look today, you
 know, that I looked -- I watch 
television, when I speak to students and I ask th
em what they ask me , that old question, can it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
67 
 
happen again, I say, don™t you ever watch televi
sion or read the newspapers and you what™s 
happening in Rwanda, Darfur and other pl aces like
 that? And I think to myself, when I look at 
children starving, I -- I™m in such
 a state. And I don™t see a black
 child, I don™t see a white child, 
I see a child. And I think -- like I said to the 
Prime  Minister of Engl
and, I said, when I was 
invited to his place, I said why can
™t we do something about it, to 
give a -- to give them each at 
least in -- a day a -- a bo
wl of rice, that would keep them alive?  I mean, we ™ve got so much and 
we give nothing.  
Q: I want to ask you about when you me
t your wife, you were -- I don™t know -- 
A: 18. 

Q: -- 18 years old, and you 
mi ssed your teenage years. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You were -- well, you were a dra -- you know -- 

A: We ll, I was very much grown up. I certainly wa
sn™t an 18 year old normal boy, I wa -- I must 
have been a 30 year old ma n, you know, 
and -- but it was no problem, you know, it -- 
Q: Yeah, we -- tell me about -- tell me her name and where she was from. 

A: Her name is Jeanette Shipper -- now she™s Shipper, she was Gorge, G-o-r-g-e. She was born 

in France, in [indecipherable] 
Alsace Lorraine. Father was born in Germany, her mother was 
born in Paris. In 1939 they came to England. Luck
ily they both ma naged to come  to England. 
Q: They Jewish? 

A: Yes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- very much so. They came to England, you 
know, I think on a visa or wha -- whatever. She 
didn™t come  on Kindertransport, she 
came as a -- with her family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
68 
 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: And she lived here, ma -- and as I told you, 
I me t her in the club, and you know, and I me t her 
once before, funny enough and I -- she didn™t rea
lize and then one day I said, you know, I know 
you from some where. I said, oh yes, yes, they 
all tell the same stor
y, you know, and -- and we 

started eventually, you know, not straightaway, ev
entually we started so
rt of dating and the 
reason was because she lived near a football club, 
so I thought if I go in the afternoon to -- to the 
football match, after the 
football ma tch I™ll be able to pick her up and we can go out, and -- and 
that™s what happened. And we™ve been ma rried for 
52 years. Like I said, I™ve got six -- I™ve got 
two daughters, six grandchildren. Four
 grandsons, two granddaughters. 
Q: Was it ever hard for her, you think, because
 I mean, even though she was Jewish she didn™t 
see the same  kinds of things that you saw as a young person -- 

A: Mm, no. 

Q: -- you know, she left w
ith her family and -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- she wasn™t in a camp or a ghetto or -- 

A: No, no, no, no -- 

Q: -- anything. 

A: -- nowhere. 

Q: So she had a different ki 
-- quite different experience. 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: And was it hard for you to explain some  of th
e things that you™d been through?  Was that ever 
a problem for you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
69 
 
A: We ll, we have -- we never -- she knew a
bout it, you know, what she had me  speak to other 
people and so on, and she didn™t ask too ma ny 
questions. But you know, be
longing to that club 
that she belonged, that every boy there was a 
Holocaust survivor, not a refugee, not a 
Kindertransport, he was a Holocau
st survivor. So she knew quite 
a lot about it without me telling 
her, you see?  Then my children -- and even today my children ask more than she does because 

she knows most of it, you know, and -- 

Q: Did you ever have -- did you ev
er hesitate telling your child
ren, or do you think that your 
children ever hes -- hesitated asking you? 

A: Well, I think it was both. I --  for the fi rst, 
I would say 25 years, very few of us Hol ocaust 
survivors spoke about it, whet
her it was [indecipherable] I 
think there™s ma ny reasons, you 
know. When we first survived and came  to this
 country, we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know, 

would people believe us if we
 told them, you know?  They would say well, you know, kids 
exaggerate, children, oh it™s a 
lot of nonsense, you know. And 
then, you know, we were so 
wrapped up in -- in work and in ma rriage and in
 bringing up a fa mily, now
 are we going to tell 
the children?  Is it fair to te
ll the children what you went 
through?  But the children started 
reading. My two daughters at le
ast, you know, that™s t -- watchi
ng films and -- and then asking 
questions, you know, and they realized what 
it wa s. And then, you know, the time  came that 

some  of us decided we™ve got to do is talk 
about it, you know. And my 
two daughters insisted on 
going to Auschwitz, and going to Lódz where I™m -- was born. They wanted to see we -- I™m 

very close to my daughters and I -- 
they are very close to me  and 
they wanted -- I said -- I said, 
why do you want to go?  You -- you know
 all about it, you™ve seen it, 
you™ve read about it. They 
said no. We  want to feel what 
you went through. I said, 
that™s not a -- what for?  Anyway, they -- 
they said if I don™t go, after time and again refu
sing, you know, they said right, we go alone. So I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
70 
 
said I ca n™t allow that , so we all went . And it wa
s one of the better things I did in life, by doing 
it, because I felt then that I owe 
it to people --  I owe it to the pe
ople that did not survive when I 
speak to young students, I say -- when they ask 
me , why do you come  and give talks?  Surely it 
hurts you, you -- brings back me mor i es. I said, do
esn™t ma tter what it does, I said, there are -- 
there were families, you know, that not one me mber
 of them survived. Now who is going to tell 

their stor y?  Because all the storie
s are very simi lar, you know?  So I decided then that I want to 
do a lot before it™s too late. I don™
t know how long I™ve still got. So for the last sort of 15 years, 
20 years, I™ve been going more and more to 
speak to students ma inly, you know, to tell them 
what happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Se
mitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing 
I tell them is hate. And I insist  -- my last two 
words to the students is, do not hate. And never 
give in, never give up. I don™t ha
te and I certainly didn™t give 
up. I™m not saying that™s why I 
survived, but I feel it -- it™s 
a little bit of a reason why, ma ybe . 
The rest -- 99 percent is -- was 
luck. It wasn™t that I was clever, it wasn™t su
ch a -- that I was such a good person or some thing. 
No, it was luck and never have the 
-- the willpower, ma ybe, to live.  
Q: You me ntioned that when 
you went to -- back to Poland, that you went to Auschwitz. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And that your grandson was with you and that he was the same  age -- 

A: Yes, he was 16, you know, he was the youngest of
 my grandsons. He was 16, of course, I was 
14 and a half, was there. I went, was for the 60
th
 anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz. 
Q: What was that like, how did he react? 

A: He -- he wrote about it and he
 really -- I -- I wa s very 
happy that I took him, you know, 
because where we were st anding on the last  day 
in Auschwitz, with the snow falling, 18 below 
zero an-and he wrote an article, I™v
e got it here and I certainly will gi
ve  it to you. It™s a very short 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
71 
 
article, and he says how he fe
lt standing there, and he wanted to come  over to me  and say, 
Grandpa, can we go now, you know, in the coach to go back to Kraków because I™m so cold. 
And then I thought, I™ve got two pair of trousers, th
ree pair of socks, two coats -- a pullover, a 
coat and a hat, boots. And he said -- and in it 
he says, and then, I thought
, there were people like 
my grandfather here wearing l
it -- like pajamas, standing in 
that cold. How can I go to my 
grandfather and tell him that I am cold?  And he 
didn™t, and I didn't know a
bout it til I came back 
to England and I found the article, my daughter ga
ve me  the article wrote, and it was published 
in a ma gazine as well afterwards, you know, and I fe
lt -- I felt very proud of hi m. Like I do about 
all my grandchildren, you know, and -- 

Q: What™s his name? 

A: Elliot Ster n. Yes, he™s -- he™s very, very much. He™s one of them -- they™re all interested in it. 

I think he™s -- mi ght be more. He come s, trie
s to listen to those things, you know, and asks 
questions, you know. A-Another one
 of my grandson wrote an ar
ticle -- wrote a play on the 
Holocaust. He is now finishing 
university, but he was taking 
the A levels -- I™m sure you know 
what the A level is, that™s the last exams the la
st two years before you go to university. And for 
that -- so he wrote an article that -- for his 
-- on the Holocaust and he performe d. There were 
seven boys performi ng [indecipherable] and it wa s very good. And he asked me  very little about 

it, so he must have gone on the internet or books 
or -- he knew a lot from me without me telling 
him. And he did well on it. So yes, he™s good. 
But I was gl -- you asked me before about me  
going back to Auschwitz. He was very good because, you know, I saw things that I™ve never saw 

when I was in Auschwitz. There was no way I c
ould see those things, 
you know, you didn™t walk 
around. And first of all, I was in biren -- Birkenau
 and Auschwitz is just the -- the -- today the 
exhibition place, you know, where you see everythi
ng and we all cried, especially when I saw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
72 
 
that room under glass with th -- with the babies
, with the children™s toys and toothbrushes and 
little spectacles, little shoes. And we hugged 
and we all cried. Said listen, under different 
circumstances that could have been my child
ren™s things, you know, and -- and they were 
some body™s children™s things and it
™s -- it™s tragic, you 
know, it™s -- it -- it was one of the worst 
things. But when I stood in the tower of Ausc
hwitz [indecipherable] you know, where the things 
are, and I said to my kids, you see, whatever H
itler wanted to do, he di
d not achieve the end. We  
won, he lost. Unfortunately, six million people die
d, but -- Jews, I mean, I -- like I said before, 
other people died.  
Q: Let™s take a break.

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: -- question about your stepfather. You ca me  in
to this family, he didn™t know you, he™d never 
me t you, he™d probably heard stor ies about you before. What was it like -- when you me ntioned 
that it was, you know, a little -- you ha d trouble 
feeling like your mother was your mother, but 

how was it for your stepfather? 

A: It was ver -- he was -- he was a very good ma
n, he was a very nice man. He certainly treated 

me  like his own son. Whether he knew much about
 me, I don™t think so, for a simple reason; my 
mother didn™t know muc h about me . She didn™t k
now what I was, what person I was. Listen, I 
certainly, at 16 or almost 17 wasn™t
 the same  person that she left in Poland when she left us. So I 
don™t know what he knew about me , you know. My mother certainly didn™t know what she™s 

getting herself into when I came to England. What
 is he going to be like, you know, as a person. 
Q: They didn™t have children of their own? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. 

Q: So you were it. 

A: I was it -- no, well the funny thing is he was 
married before and he had children and one of 

the boys lived with my mother during the war, you 
know. But then he left, I think he went to live 
with his brother and his mother somewhere in S
outh America, Argentina, I think, or Brazil, I™m 
not quite sure, but -- 

Q: And wha t  was your stepfather™s name ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
74 
 
A: Joseph Kilberg. Joe Kilberg. And he was very 
good, he was a -- he treated my gr andchil -- my 
chil-children, his grandchildre
n, like his own grandc
hildren, you know. He loved them to bits 
and -- unfortunate -- 
Q: Was he Jewish? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Was he Jewish? 

A: Yes, very much so, Polish Jew, very much
 so. But he left Poland, you know, well before the 
war, you know, he must have left Poland in the 20
™s, or some thing like it. But I don™t know much 

about the background, you know. I know he didn™t co
me  from Lódz whe r e I come  from. I know 
very little about his sons and his ex -- first wi
fe I also know -- he never discussed it, I never 
asked the question, but I knew th
ere were two boys, you know. And -- 
Q: Okay, couple more questions. You me ntioned 
that you had the opportunity to meet the queen. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And was that in your capacity with -- 
A: No. We ll, it was -- you see, it was funny, becau
se it™s a very, very simi lar thing that you got 
here. We  -- in -- a few years ago the -- the museum, the Holocaust Museum was opened in the 

Imperial Wa r Museum in London and the quee -- 
queen was invited to open the museum and 
when it was finished she was leaving, she was co
mi ng across to me et peopl
e and the president of 
the museum, or -- Englishman, that is the -- wa
s involved in the Holocaust Museum, must have 
said some thing to her, whispered some thing, th
at there are some  survivors here, and she came 

over and she shook hands with us, you know, with a 
few of us, and I was one of them that she 
shook hands with me  and through my work for th
e Holocaust Education Trust I was invited to 
her garden party, that was the s
econd time. But years and years ago, quite a long time  ago, I was, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
75 
 
through the work I was doing for Save the Children 
Fund, my wife and I were also invited to the 
garden party. But that was a long time ago. So -- so -- 
Q: Sa me  queen -- same  queen. 

A: Sa me  queen, much younger, you know, but same
 queen. No, I -- I -- I felt -- I was honored. 
You know, to meet the head of 
state, you know, i -- I wouldn™t lik
e to meet Mugabi of -- or 
people like that, but to meet -- I should call 
her by the right name , Her Majesty, the Queen, you 
know, it was a big honor. It was a big honor for me 
to meet Gordon Brown, whatever I think of 
him or don™t think of him, you know. I didn™t te
ll him whet her I™m going to vote for him or not, 
you know. But no, I felt, as a Holocaust survivor
, you know, I felt it™s not only I was invited, 
most -- I was representing the Holocaust survi
vors, not only me , and I can tell you one thing, I 
think my two daughters are more proud of th
e thing. Everybody I -- people ring me  up and you 
know and it™s friends of my daughters™. O
h, you me t the queen, oh, you met -- oh, you™re going 

to Wa shington, oh, that™s -- 
Q: We ll tell me  more about your work 
with the Holocaust Education Trust. 
A: We ll, the Holocaust Education Tr ust is -- 
was for med, oh about 10 years ago by -- it started 
by a rabbi, not Holocaust Education Trust, but 
he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in 
London, and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then some how they got 

together with a group of other people and they 
decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust, 
which is a working people, it™s not a -- they wo rk there full time , and what they do, they also 

teach teachers about the Holocaust. Teachers that ha
ve retired, or they wa nt to be in teaching 
profession any more, and they devote their time  
for that. They do it --  they get paid for it, 

naturally, otherwise they c
ouldn™t do it. And they do semi
nars for young people. But the 
Holocaust Education Trust is ma inly interest
 in taking young people to Auschwitz. Now that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
76 
 
after that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they
 decided they would be able -- they can afford 
to take two groups of children, around 200 people 
-- there would be like
 160 children. There™ll 
be teachers fr om each school. Because it™s not as
 a school, it™s about 80 schools. They take two 
students from a school, you see, local, in London, pl
us teachers, plus journa
lists. And they take 
them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come  back late. And they go to 
Auschwitz, they go to birk -- to Kraków, Auschw
itz and Birkenau. The ma
in thing is Auschwitz 

and Birkenau. And they come  back and they™ve go
t the bef -- but, so what
 I do, or people like 
me , we come and talk to them, because they 
know very little about the Holocaust. They know 
very little about the s
econd World War. But now it™
s a thing that they™vegot to learn in school, 
it™s -- it™s a must, it™s not whether 
they want or not. But how much
 is not -- doesn™t come  into it 
because how much they can just learn one hour in three mo nths about the Holocaust. So they go 

-- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Tr
ust does is they bring them -- they get them 
together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. 
Then they get another semi nar, then they go to 
Auschwitz and when they come  back they go to wr
ite about it, what they thought of it, what they 
-- the whole thing and they™ve got 
to send it in to the Holocaust E
ducation Trust, and a panel sits 
then pick four schools of two children each and 
they got to come  back to the Houses of 
Parliame nt or to the House of Lords, here in -- 
and start presenti
ng their stories, what they think, 
they™re int -- they™r
e interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some  of the 
survivors are also there, a few of
 us. And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year. 
So what they have to do, they™ve got to go to ot
her local schools and tell them all what they saw, 
what they heard. And being young people I am very
 much involved in it because I lungya -- I 
like young people, and I think it™s very, very
 imporstant they should know what happened, 
because -- and they are lovely students, most
 of them. I™ve never had any problems, you know?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
77 
 
It™s as quiet as anyt
hing, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask 
questions and -- you know, and -- 
Q: What kind of questions do they ask? 

A: Well, all different. Some are a bit silly 
ones, you know, like naturally young people, they 
want to know whether I me t Hitler, you know. I ha
ven™t been invited to 
tea by Hitler, but -- but 
that th -- one of the ma i n question, it™s always 
asked is, do I hate the German people. And they 
cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not 
hate the German people. Why should I hate 
people for -- most probably the people that they
 think I should hate are not alive today. You 
know, they™re grandparents. And mo st German pe
ople are the same  as any other people. Why 
should I blame some thi ng -- body for what their 
grandfather did, you know?  Do I ask me  -- do I 

forgive them?  Now the  people that did it, I haven™t 
got the right to forgive.
 If there is a God, God 
can forgive them. The ot hers are the people that di
ed can forgive. I certai
nly haven™t got the right 
to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg 
of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. Because 
this is not an answer, to ha te. You are the one 
that will suffer if you hate. So no, I -- I love the 
questions. So me , like I said, are silly, but some  
are very [indecipherable]
 how they -- the usual 
thing, how did you survive?  I wish I could tell 
them. I don™t know. It™s one of those things. 

People that are -- there are some
 students that are religio -- re
ligious and they, do you think God 
wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so
 that you can tell the stor
y?  I said ma ybe, I don™t 
know. But I feel it™s very important it should be
 told. We ™ve got to have awareness of what 
happened.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Because you know, in another few years there won™
t be -- the only thing you™ll be able to do 
is to read about us, what happened to the 
people in Europe between 1933 and 1945. There won™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0526  
78 
 
be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. So 
people say well, is it tr
ue, is it not, and you 
can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust su
rvivor. I have been to Auschwitz, I have seen 
with my own eyes. And I feel that™s important. 
Q: Thank you very much for sharing your
 story with the Holocaust Museum. 
A: We ll, it was -- it was really -- I don™t know
 whether pleasure™s the 
right word, but it was 
certainly my duty. The more people I tell it to, th
e more I am s a tisfied 
and I am happy about it 
with -- especially with the fee
dback I get, which makes me ve
ry happy that people do listen. 
Q: Mm. Well, thank you for telli
ng your story to us today. 
A: It has been a pleasure. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: Thank you.
