A: Let™s say this way, my father was a be
liever in religious sense. They were not 
like are here, you know, Reform, Conservative,

prayers, he took off the hat and that™s 
what it was.

A: From time to time remarks. I was very 
good in sport, so I was getting much less 
that probably did get, all boys w
ho were going to Jewish schools.

profession.

Q: All right. And living in 
Wa rsaw 
from 1932, before the war, what was that like? 
Can you describe Œ 
A: I was a student and I already distan Œ 
decided not to take any more money from 
my father, so I was working already in 
th e lawyer™s office and making money 
helping the lawyer, being already Œ you kn
ow, you didn™t have to go every day to  
the law school, you needed to take only ex
ams on the end of the year, school year. 
So I had enough time to go and to do th is
, and I was doing Œ being honest, I wa Œ 
didn™t like too much the law, I Œ I preferred 
to be probably just 
an engineer, but this 
was not the profession wh
ich you could do in 
Poland,
 especially for a Jewish 
fellow. And in family of four we were fi
ve lawyers. My brother-in-law, the oldest 
one was a l awyer. My oldest siste r was a law y er, my youngest siste r was a law y er. 
Q: And so you Œ wh
en you went to 
Wa rsa w
, were you living by yourself?

Q: And do you Œ 
A: Œ but as I said before, we did not go every day. 

Q: Right. 
A: So Œ 
Q: Which university were you a student at? 

A: 
Warsaw
 was the university, which had name later
 Pilsudski,
 but in my time was 
Warsaw
 University, and Œ 
Q: Can you describe one of 
the incidents early on in 
Warsa w
? 
A: Yes, yes, I do, because one of my  friends from 
Kielce
, which we were in school 
together, was also studying law. We went
 one day, was purpose, because you know, 
they told to sit on the left si
de, and he did sit down  also. 
Q: They told who to sit on the left side? 

A: The professor said t h e Jewish people st
ood and should sit on the left side. And 
when  we™re going out, they
 were waiting for us, you 
know, and was purpose, to 
show that we are not afraid, I showed him 
to go out first, and he knew what™s going 
on, so he showed  me, and I 
went, so he got beaten up. 
Q: By other students? 
A: That™s right. And I knew about others
, I didn™t experience too mu ch my self, 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

because as I said, I was going there only fo
r on the end of the year to take the 
exams, and that™s all w h at was. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. All right. And 
then the years Œ it was 1935 - ™36? 
A: Th-Th Œ ™36. 

Q: And you finished law s Œ 

A: School in 1936. 

Q: And then  wh at did you do? 
A: That™s a Œ what I said I pul Œ went to
 the lawyer for a Œ usually you could go to 
that court for three years and then to have tw o years with the lawyer or you could 
go for five years with the lawy
er. And so I decided to take this five years and after 
three years was already everything over, 
so I didn™t graduate, you know, I didn™t 
pass the bar exams because I wasn™t 
Œ didn™t have the five years.  
Q: Right, right. And then Œ 

A: And the rest is history. 
Q: And the rest is history. Lo Œ okay, 
let™s talk about now with th e war breaking 
out, because up to th at point you were doi
ng your re Œ wo rking with the court. 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay . And th en when your
 Œ your first memories of when the war started, can 
you describe Œ 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
10
A: That first memory? 
Q: Yeah, of when  the war started. 

A: In 1939, as a matter of fact we were 
on vacation. When I sa
y we were Œ because 
it happens that my  wife was th
ere on vacation too, togeth er. 
Q: Were you married at that time? 

A: No. 

Q: Oh, okay. 
A: We met only in 1935, this was the ye ar my wife graduate from high school in 
Warsaw
. But in 1939 we found ou
rselves in the same h o
tel in the country on 
vacation. And as a matter of fact Œ 
Q: Where was this? 
A: This was the 
Arensha
(ph) in the mountains of 
Poland
, and because I was going 
very often there the summertime, every su
mmer, almost, so I had su Œ few friends. 

One of them was a teacher there, and just 
before September first, w h ich war started 
over there, he told me, he said he read
 already mobilization paper, wh ich was not 
outside, and I told this tha Œ my  wife now 
said, I saw this and it would be smarter to 
go now back to
 Wa rsaw
. And we took together the tr
ain and we found ourself if I 
am not wrong, a day before September first,
 so Œ and the next 
day war started. And 
Œ 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
11
Q: What do you rememb er of th
at day, of September first? 
A: I found myself in my sist
er and my  brothers-in-law ap
artment. They were in the 
country this time with the bot
h children, girls. And a maid was there already. On 
September second, if I am not wrong to  the 
dates, about I can be day or two off, the 
bomb hit the back of the building and destr
oyed everything wh at was in the back. If 
I say back, in
 Poland
 usually the apartments had th
e front entrance and the back 
entrance, you know, for deliveries and ma
ids was from the back and from the front. 
So ev erything from back, no mo re entrance
 through the maid. This Œ she was there, 
I think Œ the maid was, a day or tw o mo re
 after this bombing and she decided to go 
back to neighborhood of 
Kielce
, which usually my mother
 was sending the maids 
being sure that they are the right ones, sh
e went back an d I found myself in this 
apartment, waiting until they would come. In
 meantime I found out that my  brother-
in-law was already in the service, and my 
sister came few days 
later with the both 
girls, and Œ yeah. Then  a few days later again 
SS
 came, high officers of 
SS
, and Œ 
Q: Came to the apartment? 

A: To the apartment 
because they had Œ 

Q: Were you home? 
A: Œ they  had the names of the lawyers, 
and because he was a lawyer too like my  
sister, so they came because Œ and what 
he found, the his Œ my brothers-in-law
 
coat, 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
12
which was full of blood inside, somebody br
ought to us the co
at and we thought 
that he is dead. So she kept 
this coat, my sist ers kept the 
coat in the closet and when 
he looked, saw the officer™s
 coat, she told him that 
that™s what she got from 
somebody who brought this. And then he cha
nged for a mo ment and he said that he 
will be Œ in few days the people will co
me and will confiscate everything. He 
doesn ™t want to write anything, whatever 
they will find, they 
will confiscate. And 
they left, and my sister sold everything 
almo st, in the next two days, or was giving 
away, but to get rid. And rea
lly when they came
, they didn™t have too mu ch  to take 
it out. 
Q: Were you there when the 
SS
 officers came? 
A: When the officers came? 

Q: The first time. 

A: Yes, I was there. 

Q: Did th ey say anything to  you? 
A: Nope. No, they were interested  in c
onfiscation of fu rniture and wh atever. They 
asked to open the Œ 
how you call it, the Œ 
Q: Closet? 

A: The safe. 
Q: Safe. 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
13
A: And in th e safe he took out only a on
e pin, diamond pin, 
put on his uniform and 
said looks nice, and of course then  put back
. But I think that this
 officer coat saved 
this time my sister. And later, I wasn™t th
ere when they came to confiscate, but I 
found out that they
 didn™t because 
wasn™t any more. 
Q: Then wh ere did you go? 
A: Then I decided that I will go and find ou
t if my father Œ if my brother-in-law is 

dead and my sister is alone, or I will fi
nd him and I will bring back. And I decided 
to go to the Russian side. 
Poland
 was divided this time. An
d because he was, before 
he became a lawyer, he was a judge in the town of
 Bialystok
, which probably you 
heard about, so Œ 
Q: What was your brother-in-law™s name? 
A: 
Nath an
(ph) 
Erlich
(ph). And so I decided to go th
ere and to find out if anybody 
heard, and I found him there.
 He had just came from hospital. The coat was brought 
by a friend, also an officer, who was almost sure that he is dead and couldn™t face 
my sister, so he left the co
at there and he took off the 
bandages. We went to make a 
picture and with this picture I came back 
to my sister and we were there for quite 
awhile until my brother came from 
Kielce
. Left the parents and came there because 
parents sent some money for my sister 
and for my brother-in-law who was still in 
Bialysto k
. So we decided that we™ll go there a
nd deliver this money. It wasn™t so 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
14
simple crossing the border, neither with
 Germans or Russians, so we split the 
money between, but we delivered  money together. 
Q: We? 
A: We, my  brother and my self and we we
re separated for a moment, but we found 
ourself. My brother Œ I left my  brother ther
e, togeth er with my  brother-in-law and I 
went back  to 
Wa rsa w 
because I didn't want my  sister 
to be alone. Even that two of 
the sisters who were just then together. 
And because they  had 
only two daughters, 
so they were only girls, so 
I decided that I will go becaus
e this side Œ my brother-in-
law was not in condition to come. Just 
before war started  between Russians and 
Germans, they came, they left Russi
an side and th ey came back to 
Warsaw
 and my  
brother left right away for my parents to 
Kielce
 and were there. And later was 
changing, we needed 
to give up the apartm
ents because they we
re moving people to 
ghetto, which was Œ 

Q: This is in
 Kielce
 now? 
A: This is
 Warsaw
. 
Q: Oh, now you™re talking about 
Warsaw
, right. 
A: As a matter of fact, I™m talking more 
now here about my self
 than I am talking 
about the Œ the reason I am here
, to talk about th
e Germans. And I hate to talk about 
my self, this reminds me always, you know, 
wh en you™re going to  the bank and you

want the loan, you need to 
show off how ri-rich you are,
 and believe me I wasn™t a 
hero durin g the war. I was mo re a coward th an
 Œ than  a hero, so I hate to talk about, 
but I know that the Œ I went to 
Kielce
 to visit my  parents Œ 
this is, I™m backing up 
now a little bit and this needed
 to be in 1940 and I was th
ere for a few days only Œ I 
decided to  be only fo r a few days, but in 
th is few days I went to visit my  friends 
from school, and of course when  I visited th
em, they hated to see that I am wearing 
the Jewish Œ because th
ey were not Jews, so 
they told me to take
 off, and with them, 
they don™t see the difference. And Œ and I spent out Œ 
Q: Jewish star you™re talking about? 

A: The Jewish star which we were wearing.
 And I took off and I Œ I was with them 
and when I left them, I forg
ot that I had the star in my  pocket and two regular 
German soldiers, not 
SS, 
stopped me and I don™t know 
how Œ oh no, no, I know Œ 
now I didn™t know how, but now I know. 
Two soldiers, German, were walking and 
I remind myself this time that I didn™t put, 
so I put my  hand in th e pocket and I put 
on. They  saw this and th ey stopped me a
nd they pushed me in
 their hallway and 
they asked for money. But I didn™t have to
o much and I offered them also a watch, 
and this was not enough. So I 
told them that if
 they will walk with me home, I will 
give from my parents, I will get money a
nd I will give. And that™s what it was, I 
was going in  front, they were walk ing behind. An
 SS
 stopped three of us, there™s 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

16
two sold iers and them, asking why they are 
walking behind this 
Jew. So they told 
him that, so they were arrested by
 SS
 for mixing in, and I was arrested for not 
wearing th e Œ the s Œ this was, by law, ev
en that you could be sentenced for death. 
But my  parents used the intervention of 
my ex-German teacher, who was married to 
a Italian foreign diplomat, and they went 
to  her, and she was able to pull me out 
from the jail. I was only two days in jail. And I left, of course
, Kielce
 the day after, 
it was my  accident Œ experience was Œ 
Q: Le-Let™s go back a little bit, you Œ you were
 Œ came back to be with your sister. 
We jumped ahead a little bit, 
and you had seen
 your brother 
[indecipherable]
 came 
back. 

A: Yeah, they had the 
beautiful apartment in 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Okay , and th en Œ and 
th en what happened to Œ 
A: Everybody needed to star
t to move, to give up this 
apartment, but it was time 
that they permitted you to
 exchange, so that Œ 
Q: Is this still 1939? 

A: No, 1941. ™40 - ™41. 

Q: Oh, okay, but you had vis
ited your Œ your brother-in-
law and then came back to 
be with your sister. I™m moving
 behi Œ back  Œ back again. 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

17
A: No, no, no, when  Œ we talking about 
wh en the brother-in-law came back, they 
were together and I wa
s together with them. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So he came back 
to his apartment. 
Q: He did come back, okay. 
A: Oh yes, and my  brother only we
nt to bi Œ to  the parents, to 
Kielce
. He was Œ 
Q: Okay , and th en did you stay livin
g with your brot
her-in-law, and Œ 
A: And my sister and my  two nieces.  

Q: And what did you do? 

A: As a matter of f
act, who Œ we™re funny 
[indecipherable]
. Many Jewish people 
wanted to  sell their properties. Of course
, not to Jewish people who were buying. 
Now, if this deal would be made after 
the Germans came, wouldn™t be legal. So 

what was done, that was predated that it 
started before the war, it started some time 
in 1939, and then didn™t fini
sh, and in the beginning of th
e 1939, when war started, 
it means on end of ni Œ ™39, by picking up
 mutual guy was sign as an agreement to 
fill. I was the guy whose supposed to be 
the guy who signed his 
own papers. So of 
course this way they  were getting quite 
cheap the properties. Our friends were 
getting th e money and we™re 
getting our pay for it. And 
that™s what was a living 
continuously scared. From time to time th
ey were catching us, the Germans were

18
catching on the street and taking to la
bor. Sometimes one day only  and sometimes 
was a few days and a few nights.  
Q: Did anything happen 
to you in 
1940 in Œ 
A: Yes, I was caught a few times to Œ to wo rk. 

Q: What kind of wo rk? 

A: The physical work, digging and moving 
fu rniture and wh atever they had to do. 
Q: This is in Œ in 
Warsaw
. 
A: But Œ 
Wa rsa w,
 everything 
Warsa w
, or in Œ or around 
Warsaw
. They Œ this 
time they were taking us by truc
ks and bringing back  the Œ 
Q: Where were you living? Were yo
u still living with your sister? 
A: Always Œ always Œ this 
time I was living with my sist
er and my  brother-in-law, it 

was in their apartment. La
ter the apartment was change
d for apartment Œ different 
apartment and also is a big as this, but 
they  had other friends wh ich are leaving. 
And this was going on until they started just
 to close. This time my father got a 
problem with the prostate in
 Kielce
, and needed to be operated. And I think that I 
am coming now close to 1942, this was Œ 
Q: Well, we™re still Œ 
A: Œ yes, I Œ in this time Œ 
Q: Œ we™re still 1940, were Œ anything else in 19 Œ

A: You know, this is Œ this Œ everything is Œ 
Q: The same. 

A: War was the same. 
Q: In 1941 Œ 
A: ™41, I don™t rememb er ™41 or someth
ing like this, because wait a second, wait a 
second, wait a second, wait Œ yeah, the Œ 

Q: The ghettos Œ 
A: Ghetto  started in 1940. 
Q: October 19 Œ 

A: And this was this, what I was just sayi
ng before was everything about already in 
the ghetto, what we™re doing togeth er w
ith my  brother-in-law and my  sister, you 
know, sending this Œ th is was already in
 the ghetto. This time was v ery simple, 
because the courts, which were on the bor
der between the ghetto, one entrance was 
from the ghetto side, the other entrance wa
s Œ from the other side was very simp le 
to get in. So that™s 
what was this Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 were possible to do it, 
because you could go to the co
urt and to Œ put in everything le Œ to make it leg al, 
this everything. Now, in 19 Œ so rry, in 
1942, my  father had already this problem 
with prostate and was not permitted
 by Germans to be operated in 
Kielce
. Was my 
mo ther who had so-called good looks, Ar
yan looks, decided to cover mo st of the

face of my father, he was very sick this
 time, took him by th e train and she brought 
to 
Warsaw
. He looked this way, that if wou 
Œ my mother wouldn™t be there, I 
wouldn™t recognize my own father. He had 
already infection, urine in the blood. 
And they  tried, you know, to 
help him before operation, but
 in Œ he died soon after. 
So this was only one member 
of the family that because 
of Germans, but was buried 
Œ 
Q: Wa Œ so what Œ 
when did he die? 
A: 1942, and I would say this was January
 18. I will tell you wh
y. Because January 
19 - 18, in 1943 was th Œ by Jewish, 
after 11 months you stopped talk Œ saying 
Kaddish, and th en a month later you saying 
the Kaddish, so I said this Kaddish and 
the next day I lost my  mo ther an
d my sister. So 
almost exactly. 
Q: What were the conditions
 in 1941 in the 
ghetto? Did you have enough fo od? Do 
you Œ 

A: As I said before, we were lucky b
ecause we were ha-h
aving help from our 
parents financially and we were making m
oney, like I told you before. Yes, I am 
maybe right now ashamed to say, to comp are what was in 
Wa rsa w
, yes we did 
have Œ we didn™t have 
Œ we didn™t suffer hunger.  
Q: What were your living arrangements
 that you Œ it was just your family?

A: As I said before, this was, on the 
beginning was a big apartment change for 
bigger, but some of the rooms were gi
ving to the friends
, mostly lawyers. 
Q: So you sh ared? 
A: From other si Œ from not necessary 
Warsaw
. Mostly not from
 Warsaw
, from 
different cities, but by profession lawyers 
and they had so Œ wa
s crowded but still, 
there were still two rooms for Œ for us. And they Œ 
Q: Well now it™s 1942, and you say your fath
er died in the early part of the year. 
A: Oh, this was terrible Œ 

Q: Then what happened? 

A: Œ because example Œ example, I decide
d once to take a bicycle and to  take a 
chance and to go to cemetery. And believe or
 not, I gr Œ I didn™t make it. This was 
once that I couldn™t make it to cemetery 
because of Germans. Second time, when 
war was over and I came back to 
Warsaw 
and I found my  wife
, I decided to  go Œ 
first I went to 
Kielce
 back Œ no, no, to 
Wa rsa w. 
Mixing up. And I decided to  go to  
see the grave of my  father. I couldn™t get 
in because this time Russians had the fa Œ 
the exercises Œ 

Q: Did your father Œ was your fa
ther able to have a funeral? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: He was. Okay , now we™re Œ

22
A: If you call it Œ this funeral. But anyway, 
not at least like others said, you know, 
together 20 - 30 bodies. 
Q: Right. 
A: He had this Œ 
Q: Now it™s Œ we™re in 1942, anything in
 the spring of ™42 that you recall? 
A: ™42, a very important thing was that A
ugust 12, this date sticking in our memory, 
in group of our friends we decided that 
we™re married, and also decided that we™ll 
not stay together because it™s not too safe,and especially that 
it™s war, so you know, 
you never know what will happen. So we™re
 not together, but so-called, the whole 
time when I was in all the concentration ca
mp s, I was wa Œ tho Œ thinking ab out my  
sisters, about Œ I knew that my  moth
er and the younger sister are out. In 
concen tration camp I found out from my  brot
her-in-law that my sister was arrested, 
the older one. So I also wasn™t too sure. Hi
m, I didn™t give a chance, her I Œ my  wife 

I didn™t give a chance to Œ she was too 
fragile, in my  opinion. Sh e was too mu ch 
under the cover of her older sister. 

Q: So you say you got in 
Œ you Œ this is August Œ 
A: I thought that my two nieces would su rvive. 
Q: So that Œ so in August of 
™42, you decided to get married. 
A: Mm-hm.

A: Almo st Œ almo st two Œ three yearslater Œ no, two years later, actu ally 
[indecipherable]
 almost two years later, Septem
ber of 1945, I found my wife. 
Q: Okay. We™ll get to that. 
A: I found my  brother-in-law, the name 
only, and I found the name of two my  
nieces, they made it. 
Q: Okay , it™s August of 40 Œ of 
™42, and then 
what happened? 
A: This is still going on til 1943. In 1943, I went to Œ 

A2: Up rising. 
A: Œ 
Lublin
. Upri Œ oh, this is uprising, I for
got it completely about the uprising, 
which I had preferred not to remember 
again, because its organization which I 
supposed to represent, represent to be a 
member of it, which I found out was giving 
the position where to be and a gun, only no
t bullets in it. And I was put together 
with the other fellow. 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

Q: When was this? 
A: This was on the fight of Œ get Œ ghetto
 fight. And the Œ the German machine, 
automatic machines shoo Œ 
was shooting and one of the bullets hit the guy which 
was next window to  me, hit in the face a
nd took off the Œ half of the head, and he 
was dead at this spot, and I thought that I 
got also a bullet, but not the face, only that 
the head and seeing him, I thought that myhead is off. So scary, which I told you I 

never was a hero. I looked my hand and 
I saw blood, and I passed out. So the 
Germans woke me up and 
[indecipherable]
 and going and th ey pulled us to a 
place, to a spot where was a big hole, b
ecause the other group of the fighters, 
different groups, did mar Œ put the mine 
and Germans were killed when they came 
to this spot. So they were putting guys
 around and shooting th
em. And pr
obably if 
they would have enough, they
 would put somebody else, 
but I don™t know. As long 
as we are w aiting for 
[indeciphera ble]
 they pull my watch a
nd th ey pulled my  ring. 
They  didn™t put us, they  took us, and th is
 was where I was taken to concen tration 
camp on the train and I was sick, because 
I had open only wo und right here, and 
continuously  bleeding, but what wo rse wa
s, when stop bleeding, was closing my 

eye. And this time I found my self on th e train with my  dear friend who just passed 
away, 
Henry Fenigstein
 from 
Toronto.

Q: Let™s talk a little before, and we™ll talk 
about your train ride
. Were you active in 
the resistan ce at all? 
A: No, no. 
Q: You were not. 
A: In the last moment Œ 

Q: The last Œ 

A: Œ they Œ they put this 
in, the saying about hero, becau
se after the war I met some 
of the guys who did belo ng to it and Œ and th ey wrote it on 
[indecipherable]
 paper 
that I was, and didn™t touch it because I wa
sn™t a hero, I wasn™t fighter, I was o n ly 
fooled  by my self and I was hit by a bulle
t, which I shouldn™t stay there, at the 
window. But Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ you know, when you™re ta
lking about that, I hate to  
talk about myself, is that 
fro m all my  memb ers o f  fami ly , 
I was definitely the worst.  
Q: All right. We are Œ okay, now you are 
Œ y-you were talking ab out the April of 
1943 uprising in 
Wa rsa w. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And now you™re on the train. 
A: Yeah. The train went to 
Lublin
, which was 
Majdanek.

26
Q: What kind and what was 
the con Œ what were the 
conditions on the train? 
A: Terrible. As I started to say, this 
was not regular train only, you know, for 
animals and we were Œ crowded is not 
the wo rd. We Œ you Œ you couldn™t fall 
down . Wherever you could sit down, you 
were sitting, if 
somebody was laying on 
top of you, conditions were 
awful. And as I said, my friend is Œ this physician, 
Henry
 
Fenigstein
, who was with me as a matter of f
act, if I am aliv e now, partially 
because of him, because with a pocket kn
ife, from time to time before coming, you 
know, for inspection of Germans, you kn
ow, how we looked, he was cutting in, 
opening the wound, so was opening my  wo und, my  
[indecipherable]
. And we were 
in 
Majdanek
 for a few days Œ  
Q: And how long is it Œ 
A: Œ as a matter of fact, I need
 to look up this
, this is the 
Lublin
, it™s the first, o n e 
stop Œ 

Q: No, no, how Œ how long 
did the train ride take? 
A: I don™t remember Œ  

Q: Was it only men in the train? 

A: Pardon me? 
Q: Only  men? 
A: Only  men.

Q: Only men in the train. 
A: On this train were only me Œ I don™t remember 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And so you got Œ 
A: I don™t recall, could be that the women 
were there too. I don™t know, because I Œ 
as I said, I wasn™t feeling well, I was sick
 this time, because as a matter of fact, I 
don™t rememb er too well about the staying in 
Lublin, 
in the camp, and as a matter 
of fact, whatever I remembered, was funny story, 
Henry
 re-remembered differently. 
And we were sitting and talk
ing about and he didn™t reme
mber some of the things 
which I said, I didn™t remember 
some things which he said.  
Q: What were Œ what were some of th
e things you remembered about being in 
Lublin
? 
A: Example, I remembered that 
there was a woman this time in 
Lublin
 and she was 
a wife of a lawyer, young lawyer, 
whom I knew f Œ whom I met in 
Warsaw
. And 
when she came and she saw me Œ she was 
working there Œ wh en she saw me and 
ask me what Œ why I am, you know, ti Œ my
 suit was full of holes because, you 
know, ghetto was burning and 
on the top Œ on the attics w e
re most of the feathers, 
so there was Œ 
Q: Flying down ? 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
28
A: Flying down  and was making holes in ev
erything. So  she went and she brought a 
new Œ not a new, but a good 
one, jacket for me and Dr. 
Fenigstein
. And I remember 
this exactly, I cannot recall her name. He 
doesn™t remember Œ he didn™t remember 
this. Now, I don™t think that I mad e up th
is story, because I rememb er even who 
was it, I cannot remember the name
. I see her, I see him, even. And Œ 
Q: Did you work  in 
Lublin
? What did you Œ 
A: No, no, this Œ we were Œ only this wa
s a all transition to send into different 
camps. And I rememb er only th at we had th e inspection. Again th e Germans came 
and picked  up 600 guys. A
nd with the help of Dr.
 Fenigstein
 I passed because he 
opened, and m-my  eyes were open, the le
ft eye was open too, and I was among the 
600 together with him, and Œ and again is
 a story which I remember, he rememb ers 
only partially, that when the 600 of us we
re there, the guys who were work ing, and 
there were Jews who used to be in the Polis
h army, they told us 
if we leave the gate 
and we™ll go straight, then we™re going for 
Œ they will finish us. If they will Œ will Œ 
will pass the gate and will tu
rn to the right, it means we
 are shipped to the other 
camp. So this time I thought that this frie
nd, this doctor told me, let™s stay on the 
outside, so in case they taking us straight, 
we™ll go up there Œ b
ecause they told us, 
do whatev er you™re doing when  you go insi
de, because you™re going for finish. And 

he doesn™t Œ didn™t rememb er, I don™t re
member exactly, but anyway it was not 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
29
important because we came out and we tu
rned around. I am sitting here, so we 
didn™t go straight and we didn™t do anything. Came a guy
 
by the name of 
Flaggs
(ph), whom I wouldn™t reco gnize except that I rememb er very w-well the 
name, and took us to the first camp , labor camp, which was 
Budzyn. 
And if you 
want, because I have right here this box,
 which my  friend was engraving wh en we 
were there, and this was 
Budzyn
, if we can read here, was on April 30
th
, 1943, and 
we were there til February 14, 1944.  
Q: What kind of wo rk
 did you do there? 
A: Now, when we came there, this is funny 
story, when we came there, I didn™t do 
anything because I went right away to hosp
ital. And Œ and they decided that I have 
Œ surprisingly, that I have a malaria,
 this German Œ Au-Austrian doctor, Dr. 
Firsten
(ph). I remember him because after the 
war, again, he became the Red Cross 
docto r in
 Vienna.
 He told me when  I came out fro
m hospital, after few days, I don™t 
remember, or a week, he told
 me not to get scared when
 I will feel bad, because I 
am coming back because usually
 repeats, and that™s what it was. But I know that 
when ever Œ how long I was in the camp , when  I woke up, I asked the male nurse 
who was there, who Œ with whom I became 
later friendly, I ask him, where is the 
men™s room? And he said to me, you are 
going ev ery day, so why are you asking 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
30
me? I didn™t know. He told me all my life™
s storybecause suppos
edly I was talking. 
Really, I went, after a few days, working 
again, this time working, going to. 
Q: What kind of Œ 
A: And what we were doing? Now,
 when we came to this camp, 
Budzyn
, they told 
us not to admit that you have a free professi
on, except dentists and docto rs. I wasn't 
a dentist, I wasn™t a docto
r, so everybody else should 
say that he is a locksmith. 
Now, I never saw, in my te Œ I never held in my hand 
[indecipherable]
 but 
locksmith. So there were few 
hundred lock smiths. And the ne
xt day they to ld us to 
clean the roof. That™s was th
e locksmiths. Anyway
, th ey didn™t believe it that being 
a Polish locksmith, we know what 
means locksmith, so they get us 
umscha la g
(ph). 
It means a school again, and I this time, 
first time in my life I knew what means 
[indecipherable]
, I knew what is a 
[indecipherable]
 and I knew how to make it. 
This was made there. And Œ 

Q: What were your living conditions
 like? Where were you living? 
A: Were living in barracks, sleeping on the 
[indecipherable]
. I think we had 
[indecipherable]
 one next to th e other. Wh at 
I remember from this time, I 
reme mb er o n ly  mo st of it. I r e me mb er th
at the whole night I was running only to 
urinate, you know, that™s what it was, be
cause I decided one thing, food was not 
enough. Again, I™m talking on
ly about myself. But I woul
dn™t sell my bread. I was a 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
31
smoker, and I wouldn™t sm
oke. I wouldn™t buy bread becau
se I didn™t have money. I 
wouldn™t sell my  bread either. So I stoppe
d smoking and I was drinking plenty , like 
everybody was doing. Guys w
ho were selling the bread for 
cigarettes were falling, 
you know, swelling and dying.
 And Œ and I surviv ed. Was one slice of bread for a 
day, and not a big slice, a
nd bread was awful. But I shouldn™t say this because I met 
in this camp a client of mine from before
 the war, who always, I remember him as a 
sick man, he had the ulcers, and rich fe
llow, but suffering terrible, all kinds of 
medication. And I am talking ab out before 1939, ev en 
America
 didn™t have too 
mu ch medication of ulcers li Œ today we have miracles 
[indecipherable]
. And in 
the camp he suddenly didn™t ha
ve any ulcers. This bread, 
he would eat as mu ch as 
possible, and he didn
™t have any ulcers. 
Q: What was the Œ what was a typical day like? 
A: Getting up very early in the mo rning, ge
t together for counting outside. Getting a 
cup of the cold coffee, dirty water and th
is time you got the slice of bread, which I, 
on the beginning I was br
eaking to eat half on the beginn
ing and half later until they 
stole this other half, so I was eating, fi
nishing completely. And this was not a bad 
camp to compare with the other camps. And 
then, together we were marching to the 
factory, which was not far away, by the name of 
Heinkel
(ph). They were preparing 
the people for making planes later, which 
in  other camps I was working on planes, 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
32
which Œ we didn™t suffer, but Germans su
ffered because no one 
plane took off. And 
we, in my  opinion, we didn™t do this w
ith purpose, we just di
dn't know how to do it. 
And if anybo Œ 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: Œ talking about your staying in
 Budzyn
 and wo rking in  the factory. 
A: Yes, after Œ this is an Œ every day th
e same story repeating, and wh en it comes, 
you know, to conditions, as 
I said before, were awful,
 people were 
dying because 
this was one of the camps, this was so-c
alled labor camp, not concen tration camp  
yet, and I am talking no
w because Œ about this 
Budzyn
 because from experience of 
the other camps which I had later, they were
 not used Œ we were not used to these 
conditions. Example, I was dreaming always
 about a pair of underwear. Socks. I 
was dreaming all the time in all th e con
centration camp s, I was dreaming about 
potatoes, I don™t know why not bread, but pot
atoes. Now, we can Œ we came to one 
day, they  picked up in  Œ in 
Budzyn
 Œ let me only recall what was the reason. Oh, 
they call Œ pick up a group of people to 
send to different camp. And we didn™t know 
Œ anyway, I didn't know this time that they
 are Œ they decided already to  chan ge 
Budzyn
 for concentration camp. I wasn™t there 
when th ey  changed. I was sent with 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
33
the group to 
Mielitz
(ph). And this was, looking in 
on my box here Œ excuse me. 
Mielitz
(ph) was February 16 to 
Œ ™44 to  July 24, 1944. 
Q: How did you get from one place to the other? 
A: Oh, th e ba Œ definitely by trains again,
 the same ones, but not as bad as was from 
Warsaw
 to
 Lublin
 or from 
Lublin
 to 
Budzyn
 was a little bit bette
r then. This was 
not as bad, but the same crowd and the sa
me kind of trains. And we arrived in 
Mieletz
(ph) and we got a lousy welcome. A 
good welcome from the guy in charge 
of the camp, the Jewish fellow, but a lousy from other people, because I don™t know 
why, because not every
body was the fighter on 
Warsaw
 ghetto and they called 
fighters 
[indecipherable]
 heroes, and they  didn™t like us. 
Q: What was your health like at that point? 

A: I probably was in excellent condition be
fore I went, because when I Œ when war 
was over I was very light, but the 
UGA
(ph) when  checked, they  fo und out 
everything okay, was exceptional. One left 
eye Œ and I thought that this Œ and this 
was not, because if this, then the ri
ght eye would be wr
ong, but that™s 
[indecipherable]
. No, this Œ this was not on my mi
nd never, and as a matter o f fact, 
answering this question, all my  years in
 the camp , I don™t comp are to the way my  
wife went through not bein
g in concentration camp . Because I had my  number, I 
had my  yellow and blue Jewish star on then
, this was showing that I am a Jewish 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
34
communist, because all Jews had this, a
nd the number. And I kne
w that not today, 
so would be tonight, or tomorrow, this is
 the end, but I am Œ I was myself, I w as 
always myself. She never was herself. 
Q: Did you always wear your Œ your star? 
A: Yes, yeah, because I Œ the sign we we
re wearing only when was concentration 
camp.
 Mielitz
(ph) was changed to concentration 
camp. That™s what we got, those 
two letters, which means 
concentrations lager
. And we found out later that this 
was under the 
Da cha u
. Everything from then, from 
Mielitz
(ph) we™re going, 
including that we went to 
Dach au
 itself, too. 
Q: So you got to 
Mielitz
(ph) and Œ 
A: To 
Mielitz
(ph). 
Q: Œ in February. 

A: In 
Mielitz
(ph) Œ in
 Mielitz
(ph) we were working ag ain in a factory. 
Q: What kind of factory? 
A: Th Œ everything was prepared for war. As
 a matter o f fact, again I need to go to 
ex Œ my experience. I supposed to drill on 
an electric drill press, to drill one of the 
pieces on an angle. And being later here in 
United Sta tes
 in the metal business, 
which I was, and I will come back later to 
you, how th e life is playing tricks on us, I 
was Œ I broke one of th e bits. Now wh en yo
u usually were getting five bits and one 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
35
broke, you were going to Œ for more, whic
h ag ain, one of us was there and was 
giving you not markings, so 
this way they  didn™t find out how many were broke. 
But when I broke this piece, the piece was 
spoiled, because you couldn™t get this 
half of the bits back. So I 
took out and I didn™t know th at the Germans were staying 
behind me. When  I took out this he says, 
you spoiled the piece. 
So I needed  to pull 
my  hands, and he was giving me five whip
 on the right and wi Œ five of left. And 
this cracked. And you would sa
y bad, right? No, this was not bad, this was good 
because I was sent to the camp and in th
e camp the doctor put the stitches; 12, I 
think, stitches he put, and the Œ I was sent ba
ck to the camp Œ to 
the factory. When I 
came there, there were Germ
ans, they knew everything. 
One hand, two hands, three 
hands, one leg. They  send me to machine 
which is working only
 with one hand. But 
then they came and they said, who kno
ws how to write and read? And again 
everybody is afraid, but I had only one ha
nd, so I picked up, I know how to read 
and write. To hell with it, what wa Œ wi
-will be, will be. And they send me into a 
room which was sitting a German at the de
sk and he was a Œ a draftsman. And he 
told me that Œ and bu Œ I 
forgot to say only that in 
school my  foreign language was 
German, so I could talk, and he told me 
that he will show me how to make Œ to 
become a draftsman, and will be his helpe
r. Now, I don™t know if he was provoking 
me or not, but every mo rning wh en I was coming th ere, there was a sandwich, I 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
36
think a sandwich in the paper, and he never 
said that I should take it, but I never 
took it. So this Œ that my 
hand was hit and I got the stitche
s, was only help me that I 
was in a clean place. He permitted  me even 
to wash my shirt, and to dry there and 
then to put again on, and he 
ti Œ taught me how to be a dr
aftsman. Not only to be a 
draftsman, but German draftsmen need ed to
 make on the machines the first piece, 
so he taught me even how to work on the machine. From
 there this Œ this camp was 
changed to  concen tration camp, as I said 
before, and we got th
e letters and we got 
the concen tration camp uniforms, in 
Mielitz

.
 And  Œ 
Q: What Œ what month 
was that, do you know? 
A: Now what month was this? I w ill not be
 able to tell you becau
se I told you how 
long we were in 
Mielitz
(ph)
 Œ 
Q: Right, okay. 

A: Œ and then we were Œ this
 was not long before leaving 
Mielitz
(p h)
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And this time we are alre
ady in concentration camp, 
Mielitz
(ph)
 
changed to 
concen tration camp, and of course Œ 
Q: And how did the conditions
 change when it became Œ 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
37
A: How we felt the condition ch
anged? I think Œ be
cause again, is something, what 
happened, which I told
 you on the beginning, never was a hero, was a coward, I 
couldn™t Œ th is is only one army , the Germ
an army that I canno
t recognize what Œ 
A2: Rank. 
A: Œ they are officers, or Œ  

Q: Rank, the rank. 

A: Œ rank, never, never could. I know ev
erythi Œ everybody™s else™s, I couldn™t 
recognize. Russian is very ha
rd, but I got it. But here Œ or
 my  head doesn™t want to 
remember, or I couldn™t reme
mber this way, no faces. 
Now, I think that the Œ 
number one, that we got electric wires 
around the camp. I think this time we got, 
which was not too good for us, not only 
because nobody was ru
nning away, but the 
guy in ch arge, this
 SS
 man had the horse there, outside the camp , and th e horse 
once, fly or something bother, and he star
ted to kick, and kicked th e fence, and 
dropped dead. So we 
were suffering because we killed 
the horse, so 
when you want 
to know about the co nditions Œ 
I think the change was also 
that instead of Œ of guys, 
special army, 
SS 
came in and th ey were in charge of the camp . But other ways the 
conditions were similar ones. 
Q: Still the one piece of bread a day? 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
38
A: Yes, the same, that™s almost the sa
me, didn™t change. Not that I recall. From
 
Mielitz
(ph), as already, we went to 
Wieliczka.
 I remember now, I think that 
Wieliczka,
 which were not too long th
ere. We were from July 25
th
, to August first, 
so what was this, a week? 
Q: A week. 

A: Something like this. We were ther
e and from there we were sent to
 Flossenbürg
, 
I don™t remember if 
Flossenbürg 
was 
Germany
 or 
Austria
, but anyway  we went to 
F-Flossenbürg, 
and we were there Œ the trip wa
s quite long. No w Œ now Œ now I 
don™t recall here Œ you see, he mad e a mist
ake here and he crosse
d out this, and here 
is li Œ written that on September four, we came to
 Flossenbürg. 
Q: Do you remember Œ 

A: And I don™t remember if we left 
Flossenbürg
, because he has only one date, 
September 4
th
, 1944 li Œ 
Flossenbürg. Flossenbürg
 was a very different camp. No 
other camp that I ever was, was the same . The Œ first, was in the mountains, and 
was in a different levels of the Œ of the 
mountains. On the very top were Americans 
prisoners of war, on the very top. Now, we
 were, when we came 
there, they first, 
they undressed us and th ey ch anged the Œ 
th e places, so if you had something you 
hide Œ was hiding, you lost, 
because they took you naked 
to the other place. We got 
the shower and then they ga
ve you a potato sack. And ev erybo-body need ed to go to 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
39
sleep in this potato Œ I was sure that this
 is the end probably, 
he will Œ we™ll go to 
the potato sack and this will be the end, bu
t no. And the next day 
they gave us clean 
uniforms and we were there, we
 were not doing anything in 
Flossenbürg.
 Every 
day was only to get up, to counted that Œ th
at we were Œ that™s what Œ probably what 
he wrote to 
Flossenbürg, 
that we were very short time, and probab ly days only. 
And floss Œ 
Flossenbürg
 we were sent to 
Leitmeritz
. And I am almost positive that 
Leitmeritz
 was in aus Œ 
Austria , 
not Œ not in 
Germany
. And there we were from 
July 10 Œ no, no, no
, wait a second, June Œ that™s 
right, no, August 10 Œ how can be 
September there and Au gust 10 to October 1944 in  
Leitmeritz. Leitmeritz, 
Leitmeritz, Leitmeritz 
is not far away from, because
 we heard about, was from 
this show camp  Œ 

A2: 
Theresienstadt
. 
A: 
Theresienstadt
. And I think 
Theresienstadt
 was not in 
Germany
, right, this 
was 
Austria
? 
Q: 
Austria. 
A: So th is was 
Austria
 too. And in 
Leitmeritz
 I have a very funny experience, that 
I was sent once by th e guy in ch arge of ou
r group to pick up 
the bread, you know, 
for Œ for everybody. S-So many guys were
 sent, and I came there and the guys who 
were giving out the bread was talking Polish.
 And so I turned to them and I started 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
40
to talk to them. And one of them walk 
away , comes to me and he says, where are 
you from? And I was used this time, being so many years in
 Warsaw 
to say from 
Warsaw.
 And he says oh, so not you, because you remind me somebody. I said, not 
from 
Kielce
? He says yes. And he not only ge
t me the bread, for 
everybody, but he 
also put the package of salami, which not 
only I ate, everybody, and everybody got 
sick. Okay, so this where my 
[indecipherable]
 
Flossenbürg Œ Leitmeritz
, excuse 
me. In
 Leitmeritz
 Œ what would bring 
Leitmeritz
? 
Q: Were you wo rking th ere? 
A: I always wor-worki
ng. Experience was Œ  
A2: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ I seen a Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 were almost that 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: There were so many of them. 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: I don™t Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 Do you ever Œ do you remember
 ev er being terribly, terribly 
frightened  up to  the Œ 

A: I was always frightened. 

Q: What were your thoughts? 
A2: About suicide 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
41
A: Because you see, as I told you before, I knew it. Said any day will come the end. 
I didn™t know only how. And 
if I am not wrong, this was
 Leitmeritz
 even. In 
Leitmeritz
, in our barracks specially, were qu
ite few Yugoslavs. And very  often, 
when you got up in 
the morning, one of 
the Yu goslav was hangi
ng, suicide. From 
my experience, the nicest people with
 whom I was in the camp, were the 
Yugoslavs. Maybe because of language wa
s similar and maybe of their behavior 

and maybe because of this experience, th
at I didn™t come across in concentration 
camp, of suicides committed by anybody else
 but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself, 
this time I thought so, said 
when Œ I will not fall asleep. 
Only I will be waiting, and 
if I will see that somebody™s doing, I 
will follow and I will do the same. A fu nny 
story, when I didn™t fall asleep, I was 
tired the next day and nobody did commit 
suicide. But when I did fall asleep, someb
ody did. So  wh at I figure out, probably 
when  I heard the noises that somebody™s tr
ying to commit, being a coward , I fall 
asleep. I-I™m not joking, but pr
obably that™s how it was. 
Q: When you were in these different camps
, how aware were you of what else was 
happening in the rest? 

A: On th e beginning I knew,
 when I was in the Œ in 
Budzyn
, even 
Mielitz
(ph)
, 
Wieliczka, 
sometimes we got some news. 
As a matter of fact in 
Budzyn
 I got the 
news from my  brother-in-law that
 my siste r was arreste d .  

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
42
A2: Now this was
 Poland. 
A: Because these are all Polish Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: As a matter of fact, I got to the sister of this Dr. 
Fenigstein
, who was playing a 
Aryan, brought money from my  brother-in-la
w. So we had Œ later we didn™t. We 
were getting some news. How they were comi
ng, I don™t know. I think that the first 
real news what was going out, we got in 
Dachau
. Then later, after the war I found 
out that they  had the underg round. Bu
t then we got what is going on, and 
Da chau
 
was already Œ 
Q: But we™re still in
 Leitmeritz
, so Œ 
A: Yes, 
Leitmeritz
. No,
 Leitmeritz
 we didn't know. We knew only Œ 
Leitmeritz 
we got only news that 
Theresienstadt
 is not far away. That there is better, but 
nobody was sent there . An
d as a matter of fact, in
 Leitmeritz
, and I read here what 
he wrote there, that friends were so
meplace when Œ and I 
thought that in 
Leitmeritz
 
this was, but it™s not Œ he Œ he wrote in 
some place that our friends Œ because there 
were two camp s, and you see, very often 
when the groups were sent to different 
camps, there were at least to two different
 camp s. And you coul
d switch, you could 
go from one to the other because I don™t 
think that they did care really, if 
x,y,z 
went 
to one camp, even that
 they were release, because the 
Œ most of the release were not 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
43
completed because people were dead alread
y by this time, or that they did care 
which ones are going. So if you moved 
from one group to the other group, they 
didn™t make a issue of it. And I™m saying 
th is because I am holding in  my  hand this 
box wh ich th is 
Greenstein
(ph) made, and he was ther
e, young fellow, he was 
probably  four or five years younger than
 I was, and had even younger brother and 
wherever I went he was saying 
he wants to go to and I Œ in 
Leitmeritz
 especially, I 
remember that we™re choosing and I said
 boy like that™s enough it™s enough. Maybe 
I am picking up the wor Œ the bad camp 
and you will suffer beca
use you follow me. 
Don™t. But he did. 
Q: All right. 
A: And so, from 
Flossenbürg, 
we went Œ 
Q: 
Leitmer Œ 
A
: Œ 
to
 Leitmeritz. 
Q: And then from Œ 

A: And
 Leitmeritz 
we went to 
Grakow
(ph). Now, I don™t remember 
[indecipherable]
 Œ to 
Dach au
, first to 
Dachau
. And in 
Dach au
 we were from 23 
to 29 of October ™44. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And from there Œ 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
44
Q: What Œ do you rememb er that week? 
A: 
Dach au
 yes, I remember. I remember the first,
 I will never forget in my life, on 
the gate was written
 Arbeit macht frei. 
And the Œ 
Ho rth y
(ph) 
was on th e Œ on the 
gate, the gardener there. He was one in 
the uniform. I don™t know even who showed  
us that this is 
Horthy
(ph), but when we came here Œ and the other experience was 
that they were keeping us outside on th e Œ you know, not going to th e barracks. 

Before we enter even
, they kept us for 12 hours w
ith the toilets, you know, on the 
field, because they though
t that maybe people will Œ 
could hide something, you 
know, that Œ that Œ so th ey had all work ed
 out scientific Œ  scie
ntifically. And then 
we were sent and I Œ if you saying about 
Da chau
 these few days, I remember o n ly 
that that guy in charge of this barrack
, which welcome us, was number red triangle, 
which means he was a communist and 
had numb er 999. He was in the 
Da cha u
 
since 1933. German, older guy, beautiful sp
oken, welcome us and told us that every 
guy, we get two covers. And please, when 
you will be leaving, I beg you, leave this 
too. 

Q: The blankets. 

A: The blankets 
[indecipherable]
 ghetto. But Œ 
Q: Were you still Œ you were still weari
ng your Jewish star all this ti Œ  

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
45
A: Di Œ di Œ always
 you had th is triangle and the 
number, which was changing from 
camp to camp. As a matter of fact, I neve
r rememb er my  nu mb e
r. I remember what 
I was wearing, and I had to remember, because from quite long time, and I think I 
met h i m in  
Mielitz
(ph) but I got very close with him in 
Augsburg, 
or someplace 
there, was a deaf mute fello
w, an excellent tailor, excelle
nt. As a matter of fact, in 
the camps he was getting extra bread fro
m Germans because he was fixing their 
unifo rms. He Œ he was a arti
st. A nd whenever they were 
Œ we™re called, he couldn™t 
hear his name, his number, so what I was, and I could talk with him by hands. I 

don™t know language, but my  hand
s, I could talk to him. 
So I pushed him when his 
number was called. And he was just deciding, 
if they said right and he wanted to go 
left, he played dumb and he 
went left. So he was choosi
ng, and he survived  the war, 
too. Now Œ 

Q: What Œ what Œ what
 else did you do in 
Da cha u
? Did you do any work in that 
week, or Œ 
A: No, 
Dach au
 was only, we were in this barra
ck, only few si-sis Œ you know, few 
days and from 
Dach au
 we™re sent for work to Œ first
 
was 
Augsburg
. In the 
Augsburg
, believe or not, we were staying outs
ide, out of the city
, in suburbs, and 
every morning we were walk
ing through the city of 
Augsburg
 to  the other side of 
[indecipherable]
 preparing for a airport, for future 
airport. And I don™t know if this 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
46
was really for the airport, that™s w h at 
they were calling. We were doing stupid 
things, digging and closing an
d filling and Œ and 
Œ and Œ and Œ and 
nothing, nothing 
productive, but that™s what it was.  
Q: How long were you in 
Aug sburg
? 
A: In Œ in Œ in 
Dach au
? 
Q: No, in
 Aug sburg
? 
A: In 
Augsburg
 we were from October 29 to Decemb er first of 1944.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then from 
Augsburg
 we were sent to 
Leonberg
.
 Leonberg . 
Do  you th ink 
that I remember now 
Leonberg
? I don™t rememb er 
Leonberg
 too good because I 
know Œ I remember th at fro
m Œ how long we were in 
Leonberg
? We were in from 
December Œ December first, the same day. So you see, 
Augsburg
 and 
Leonberg
 
are very close to each other because the 
same day we were there. Til ™44 Œ til 
February of ™45, only  two months. So ag
ain probably Œ again doing nothing Œ not Œ 
nothing important, nothing productive, no mo re was building the planes or 

something, that™s what I recall.
 Then we were sent again to 
Kaufering,
 wh ich  
everyth Œ ev ery single one, 
Aug sburg
, 
Nuremberg, Kaufering, 
lager one, lager 
two and 
Landa u
 and 
Ganacker,
 these are all camps of 
Dach au, 
wh ich  was 
[indecipherable]
. And I don™t recall doing anything except few Œ few experien ces 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
47
again wh ich you had the example, in one of this 
Kaufering
 lagers, a guy wanted to 
Œ was walking too close to the fence, wire
 fence, electric wire fence, probably 
because somebody was throwing 
something. I was not a hero
 like I told you before, 
I wouldn™t bother cross, and the gar Œ guy on the 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Tower? 

A: Tower, sh Œ did the shoot in his direc
tion and hit his testic
les. And he grabbed 
the testicles and run to this male n u rse and 
he never knew what to do with that, and 
he put plenty  of bandages 
around, and few hours later we
 deci Œ they decided that 
we changing the camp and going. And that 
guy was suffering, but this was shortly 
before the end of it. Americans came and 
they operated him. And as a matter o f 
fact, we met him after the war, he was not
 only married, but he had children too. 
What else? Other camp, one vo Œ one of the 
lager, two, during the night, we were in 
the barracks which different Œ you know, 
digged out from in the ground and on th e 

roof above, and not too ma
ny guys, maybe 12 guys in on
e of this. And during the 
night this Œ that mute guy w Œ was shak
ing me, I woke up in  dark . I was asking 
what is it, and he showed me that we™ll 
be going. Now, nobody heard this. He was 
right, and we were going to 
other camp . This was one of the very end. We went to 
Kaufering
. The name was Œ this was April fourth
. And this is already 1945, so this 
is just Œ just before the end of the war, a
nd we were in lager Œ lager one, lager two. 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
48
If you want to hear Œ this not about me, 
but about the guys who were in the camp 
with me. You know, in one 
of the camps, A mericans ca
me down and were shooting 
around the camp because around the camp th
e Germans put the small planes, and 
the Americans found out ab
out this, so they came down and they  were shooting 
from inside the camp, not to 
hit us, to the planes, and the planes went on fire. And 
the guys from the camp used this to co ok something on the 
belly the planes.  
Q: So was this where y
ou were liberated from? 
A: Yeah, this is the experience of Œ the last one was 
Ganacker,
 and in 
Ga na cker 
one day Œ it was 
La nda u 
or 
Ga nacker
, was one day and they decided the whole 
camp, wh-w hich  if I am not wrong were clos
e to a thousand of guys, oh, to take us, 
and the Germans said that we™re going to
 Landshut
. You probably heard about, this 
was quite the camp too, and the speci
fic camp, because when I was in 
Dach au
 the 
chimneys were not wo rking, it means 
they were not burn ing anybody. But
 
Landshut
 was still w o rking. W-We knew that is
 activ e. And they were supposed to 
transport us walking there. On the way, on 
a big one field, they 
told us to sit down 
on th e ground. And few minutes later, they 
disappeared, their whole group of s-m Œ 
SS
 mans disappeared. We found ourselves 
without a guard. And as I said, thousand 
people. And a German fellow, who had that
 green triangle, green triangle it me ans 
he was a killer who was sent from a jail to 
the concentration camp, that™s what he 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
49
had, the green one. Tall one fellow, he told
 us why he was in jail. H e killed a owner 
of a villa which he thought that is empty,
 and he went there and he found him, so 
was one solu tion, him or her, or the owne
r. So they found him and th ey sent him 
back there to concentration camp. 
This guy, when he saw that the 
SS
 men  
disappeared , went on a big Œ 
A2: Podium? 

A: Not podium, though it was a podium 
[indecipherable]
 only pieces of wood and 
he said to us, look fellows, we are in southern  part of 
Germany
, which is called 
Niederbayern
. This is Catholic part of 
Germany
. These people hate 
Hitler
 and 
Jews. That™s what he said. So from now on, 
no one is a Jew. We are Catholics, even 
when you are Protestants. Then you will 
get help from these people. And now we 
cannot go thousands, so let™s make sma
ll groups and go. So we made small groups 
and we decided to go all di
fferent ways. Thousand people
 and only  one fellow, who 
acted very nicely in all the camps, by the name of 
Markowski
(ph), which was a 
secretary in few camps, it means he was k
eeping books and ev erything, and he was 
very nice. He told me that he
 is a lawyer from the part of 
Lv ov
, 
Poland
. And I 
remember that in the camp, where we were 
this time, I needed 
to say Kaddish after 
my father. And I went to him and I said to
 him Œ I was very friendly with him, and I 
said to him that I have a problem. I need 
to have 10 Jews to say the Kaddish. And 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
50
he looked  at me and he says, look, I do
n™t know Jewish relig
ion, but Œ you know, 
I™m not a Jew, but I think that your relig
ion is saying 10 men, not 10 Jews. Now if 
you will not ask if somebody is Jew or 
not, I will call the people and I will say
 
Joseph
, it means we are 10 here. And you go to
 the window and you do whatever 
you want. And so it was. He 
decided to take a group of 
Pola cks. Polacks 
it means 
not like us 
Pola cks
, only 
Pola cks Œ
 Catholics, and I should take a group of 10 
Jewish with us, and we will go together. We
 went together only for two days. After 
two days we had bloody noses. It 
started the calling names, and fights. 
Q: Between the Jews? 

A: That™s right. And we needed to split. He
 went with his group, we went with our 
group. Now, in this time, we™re ru
nning away, not knowing we are in 
Germany
, 
not knowing where we™re running. We were
 afraid Œ we still didn™t know what™s 
going on, if we will not come against Œ against 
SS 
or whomever. 
A2: And everybody thought 
[indecipherable]
 
A: So we Œ we decided Œ we decided to 
hide during the day and mo ve only in  the 
evenings. And so we™re doing. On e wo man 
Œ we came to a place, and we thought 
that we are safe, then two
 SS
 men showed  up and they  grabbed us and th ey brought 
us to a Œ a farm where they had already 
few other people, I don™t know if from our 
ex-camp or different camps. And in this 
we were watching and were two entrances. 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz  
 
October 7, 1993 
 

 
 
51
One was from the left and one 
was from the right. And the two 
SS
 men  were 
walking around this building,
 so we could see them wher e they are on one side, and 
when they coming on other. A
nd being next to one guy, I 
told him, when they will 
come on this side and they will pass, I am
 going out this way. 
I don™t want to be 
here any mo re. We made a mistak e, I want 
to Œ and he says, I am going, too. Befo re 
knowing, six of us Œ ye Œ one knew  about 
the other, when they 
came here, we took 
off, and we run. I-If you ever saw coward 
running, we were Œ we could break all 
records, until we came to the woods. After 
the woods there was a wall, brick wall, 
we jump ed over and we didn™
t hear anything any mo re, a
nd walking. I told this 
story because I want to tell you, after th
e war, when  we found ourself again Œ we, 
my wife and myself, in this part, in 
Germany
, I took my wife 
to show her, and I 
went to the same place, I showed her wh
ere are the two doors, and I said on the 
right door when they were on the left, we 
run, let™s walk. And we walk and there 
was a forest. And we went through the fore
st, we came on th e end of the forest and 
there was a brick wall seven feet tall. And Ilooked on it and I said no, this was not 
this. Probably I made the mistake. This is 
the other side, it™s the other door. I mi ght 

Œ no, there was no the other door. I took all 
the guys who jump ed this wall and they 
didn™t want, even one wanted 
to believe that we made this seven foot wall. She saw 
it. It was impossible. What you could do 
when you are scared. And that™s what we

run, we were s Œ hiding me and the other 
guy, because we split 
that more andmore 
for safety. And with the other fellow wh
o didn™t Œ who survived  the war, but we 
split it after the war because he married a 
German young girl. She was younger than 
the youngest daughter of here would be. A
nd because of it Œ so we split it. We were 
during th e day in th e woods and during th e 
night were sleeping at the farmer, who 
knew that we are hidi
ng because we were 
[indecipherable]
 of course. And one 
afternoon we were already tired to sit in th
e woods, we decided it™s not dark  yet, but 

let™s go, cause no movement. And as we™re
 w alking out from the forest, we see a 
Jeep
 on the Œ on the highway and we st
op and the machine gun went to our 
direction and th e soldiers shouting to run. 
So we started to run not moving, only run 
up and down , and I say I am running back 
to  the wo ods. And the fellow says, I 
don™t think that we have a chance. And we
 came Œ we were so scared, that we 
didn™t see the American star. 
Q: And then you Œ and 
then what happened? 
A: Then Œ this was called freedom. Few days
 later, when we got together, a few of 
our fellows from different hi
ding places there, from diff
erent farmers, we thought 
that that™s all what is le
ftover, you know, survivors. Ev
erybody else died, probably. 
So we wanted to know if any Jews are 
in American army. So we™re waiting and 
we™re talking Polish and one 
of the Polish fellow American
, when we ask in Polish

if there are any Jews in the American army
, he said to me, Jews? Jew s are in Œ in 
America
 making money. No w, he didn™t know
 who is his major because the next 
day was a big sign that they major by th is
 Œ this name I d on™t remember now, 
American name, wants to see a
ll Jews. And we said this is
 the end, we™re not going. 
So we had one fellow who kn
ew a little bit English, and 
we said, he will not grab 
this one when he knows that there are othe
r ones. So when he 
will not come back, it 
means that to me he wants the Jews. If he
 will come back we will know what is 
about. No , he came back to tell us that he is a Jew, and he won™t beat you.  
Q: Then you met with the 
Œ the Œ the Jewish officer, American Jewish officer Œ 
A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact Œ 
Q: And what happened then? 
A: Œ as a matter of fact, he was a major of
 the army , he was quite touched when he 
saw quite a group, because I Œ he was the 
one who told us that we are not the only 
one who survived , that there are other gu
ys too. We were in terrible physical 
condition. Terrible I am saying this way, that some of the 
[indecipherable]
 were 
not more in the war, we were free. When we
 looked, I could see the Œ exactly all the 
bones on the face and of the 
[indecipherable]
 especially guy by the name of 
Ackerman
(ph) who few months later Œ and I am exactly a few months later

because we talking we
 were freed on May 1
st
, 1945, and on th e beginning of 1946, I 
was back in the same p art with my
 wife already. And we met this 
Ackerman
(ph).  
Q: So what Œ what happen
ed right after, after you we
re free? Where did you go? 
A: We were Œ right after we were free, 
the first reaction was from the farmer, that 
we didn™t admit that we are Jews because 
we thought that this 
will be not nice to 
him that we are playing Catholics to save us, 
that to Œ now to Œ to tease, so we were 
staying there. I remember only that he wanted
 to give us to eat anything he has there 
and he mo ved us to his be
droom and he moved out from the bedroom. Two of us, 
he put. And I didn™t want to drink milk. I 
was afraid. I was skin
ny and I was afraid 
of fat. I loved milk, but I was adding water to
 it, and meat altogether I couldn™t look 
on it. So he killed a pigeon 
and Œ and Œ and prepared. Bu
t my friend who didn™t care 
about and was eating the meat, 
he survived  too, and he 
Œ and he was okay. I was a 
coward, I was afraid of everything. And as
 a matter of fact, I don™t think Œ I don™t 
think that I ever admitted to
 this farmer, small farmer, 
I never admitted that I am 
Jewish, even when I came late
r with my wife to visit hi
m, because I thought he was 
a nice fellow. Remember his name even, 
Markmel
(ph). And Œ 
Peter 
Markmel
(ph). And as a matter of fact, he 
lik ed this fellow from concentration 
camp, this was a green triangle, said 
that they are Œ they hate Jews and 
Hitler
. He

hated
 Hitler
, really he hated 
Hitler. 
Ha Œ about Jews, I never spoke to him about, 
so I don™t know.  
Q: Where did you go after you saw the major? 
A: After Œ after I felt a little bit strong
er, I found out that not far away from 
[indecipherable]
 where I was staying, this
 time I was freed there in 
Langerfelden
(ph)
,
 I decided to go to next to wn , wh ich was 
[indecipherable]
 
because I heard that there this 
Markowski
(ph), which I told you  before, this fellow 
who was splitted, was preparing the Po
lish pe-people for repatriatio n to 
Poland
. So 
I wanted to see him. In  funny way I felt that
 I mu st go to him and to say that in my  
opinion, he is a Jew. And I came there, a
nd I told him. And he
 said to me, thank 
you, but I will to disappoint 
you, I am not a Jew. And Œ but
 it™s nice of you, because 
I understand wh at you mean. 
And this was everything wh
at I heard about him. He 
ask me also  if I™m going to
 Poland
, and I said yes I am going because I need to find 
out what happened to  my  family. And you kno
w, in the beginning 
I told you that I 
found my wife, my tw
o nieces and my  Œ 
Q: So you went 
Œ you got back Œ 
A: After I got back to 
Poland. 
Q: How did you get b
ack from where you were?

A: By that same train, whic
h was taking th e official repa
triates, I went with the Œ 
the Polack Œ I went there and I just walked
 togeth er with them and Œ but I wasn™t 
officially coming, but I found myself in 
Poland
. As I said, I found my wife, I found 
my two nieces, I fen Œ found
 my ex-brother-in-law. 
Q: Was this in
 Warsaw
? Where was this? 
A: The Œ my  Œ the Œ the story was this wa
y. My wife, as I mentioned before, she 
was false p apers. She survived
. She wasn™t as Œ as Œ as
 delicate as I thought she 
was. She needed to be str
ong and she showed that she is a strong woman. My two 
nieces were placed with Catholic families.
 M y  brother-in-law 
found himself in a 
concen tration camp for a short time on the very end. My  sister 
[in d ecipherable]
 he 
noti Œ notified me in camp that was arrest
ed Œ was arrested because she helped  him 
to survive and sh e was arrested a
nd she was killed also by Germans.  
A2: Your other sister, too? 

A: My other sister was kille
d together with my mother, 
but this was in ghetto. My 
brother-in-law was shot. They
 were taken to probably 
Treblinka
, which later I 
figure out.  

Q: How long did you stay then in  
Poland
? 
A: Very short. I was Œ was one month alre Œ

Q: Can you tell us somethi
ng ab out what happened in 
Poland
 after the war was 
over, betw een September Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ after September 1945? 

A: Numb er one, when I came to 
Warsaw
 I went to the Jewish Committee, like I 
said, to find out if anybody 
survived and I found
 out there that my  two nieces and 
my  brother-in-law were registered. And Œ 
and my wife, which my friend said not Œ 
you will not find her in 
Warsaw
, you will find her in 
Lódz.
 And I didn™t look fo r ne 
Œ neither one of the nieces or my br
other-in-law, I decided to go to 
Lódz
. A one 
hour or two hours trip usually was taki
ng th e whole night, or the whole day, 
whichever you preferred. I came to 
Ló dz
 and I lost myself beca
use I didn™t ask this 
friend of ours what is address of 
my wife. So he 
said to go to 
Ló dz 
to the Jewish 
committee. I just took th e train and went back  to 
Warsaw
 to get the address, and 
the next night I deci
ded to go back to 
Lódz. 
Now, when I came Œ  
A2: But I was under my false name. 

A: When I came there, knowing the address 
what I supposed to go,
 so I came. This 
was a second or third floor walk up, of
 course. And I saw iron door, because 

someone had s Œ before the war even too, 
safety doors. Saw two cards on th e door.

One was the false one name of my wife and the other was written
 
ell Œ 
I. 
Wokaszevicz
(ph), major Œ 
M.D.
, major of Polish mil Œ military. 
A2: Army 
A: I looked on it, door was closed, nobody
 home, I looked on it and I said I came 
too late. Because I don™t know, probably from the stories you heard from other 
people, that the husband were coming to th
e weddings of Œ of their wives. Here 
wouldn™t be because we™re le Œ really not 
Œ we™re not legally married. So Œ and she 
couldn™t believe that I surviv
ed, and sh e couldn™t Œ I didn™t
 believe it that she will. 
So I thought better let her think that I am 
dead, and I turned back
 and went to these 
people where I was staying, 
only Œ family of my  brothe
r-in-law. And I came back 
and I told them that I saw this, and was 
a nice fellow. So sitting at the Œ in the 
evening and having the supper Œ because
 you know, we think differently in 
Europe
, 
the big meal you see in the lunchtime. So
 the small meal Œ he says to me, don™t do 
it. You understand and you are honest. Go, 
tell her and just say that, bless her and 
that™s all. B u t at least let her know. I said, 
this is teasing, and Œ but I decided to  go, 
later Œ few hours later I went and the door
 was open, th is Œ this iron door. So  I 
knocked at the door. Sh e came and back ed 
up. So I said, hey, you made a mistake. 
So I thought, turn around and 
go. But she says, what you 
staying, wh at you waiting? 
And I 
[indecipherable]
 and I said, who is the Major Doctor? She says this is 
Ire n e

[indecipherable]
. She wasn™t a doctor, she wasn™t 
a major. But she had guts enough 
that the war Œ she became later a d o ctor, 
M.D.
 
A2: And she married a Christian a
nd sh e didn™t tell him anything.  
A: But she Œ this time she already was. A
nd this time I told my wife, sitting there 
and telling about how I went and how she 
went, and I told her, what I went is 
nothing to compare what yo
u went. And we decided th at
 Poland
 is no mo re place 
for us. 
Warsaw
 was a cemetery. Like I told
 you before when I went to
 Warsaw
 
because I wanted to see the 
grave of my father, I couldn
™t get in. So, was only one 
thing to go. And to go 
[indecipherable]
 officially from
 Poland
, I got to Œ one, I 
was nominated as a ju dge for 
Breslau Wrocla w
. Second, to get the paper to go to 
West Germany
, when  I got nomination and they 
ask me when I was born, I said 
this time, 
Eggenfelden niederbayer.
 And th e secretary looked  at me, I said, don™t 

look so at me, because I am
 Polish citizen, onl
y my mother was pregnant when they 
were in 
Germany
, and I was born there, but my  home is really 
Kielce
 and I got 
everything in 
Kielce.
 But wh en  you asking me I need to tell you where was this? 
This was, you know, 
southern part of 
Germany
,
 
that™s where I was born. I figure 
myself, I am from Œ born, and really the 
birth means so important. I am going back 
because my parents,
 when were in 
Germany
, and they never were, and I was born 
there, they decided to stay
 there for awhile and they buy Œ bought some of real

estate. Now, war is over, I want to sell the 
real estate, so I wa
nt to go there. So 
together we left, you know, 
Wa rsa w
 and we were going to 
Ry chbak
(ph),
 
this was 
Rych bak
(ph) but through
 Wroclaw.
 And when we came there, we met a fellow 
who was with me in the concentration ca
mp , but he was work ing already for the 
political Œ 
A2: Secret service 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ ta Œ eff Œ 
F.B.I. 
Q: Intelligence Œ 

A: That™s right. 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: That™s right, Intelligence, Polish Inte
lligence. And we were sittin g and after 
awhile talking, talking, he said to me
, you know what? You™re
 not staying here. 

You will not be a judge here. You want to leave
 Poland. 
I say, I will tell you 
something, if I cannot tell you th e truth, then
 I will not be able to tell anybody truth, 
yes I am. H e says, with my blessing. I w
ill do the same so on. And I said Œ and my 
wife told him experience which we had in 
Lódz.
 Right after I came, and I was very 
dis Œ weak this time. I was 
in good condition still to co
mpare to everybody, but I 
was skinny and weak. We we
re going and we decided to  go to bakery to buy 

something, cake or bread, I don™t rememb
er and were few steps, as we were 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

reaching this bakery, a Polish drunk, abou
t completely drunk, he couldn™t stay on 
his feet, was walking down  and he recognize 
right away  that I am a Jew and he said 
oh my  God Œ in Po lish, of cour
se, oh my God, I thought that
 Hitler
 finish all the 
Jews, but there are more. And as weak as 
I was I grabbed him by th e should ers, and 
to the wall and my wife behind me, leave 
him alone, leave him alone. And I left him 
alone and she told th is guy, and I said 
I still didn™t forg ive her because I should kill 

him. And he says wait, hold a second
. You wouldn™t be able to kill him 
[indecipherable]
. Now it depends who would come there. If I would come I would 
finish this guy with a gun and not tell you 
to go, but if this 
would be a different 
group and this would not be a Jew, you wo
uld be the dead  one. So  you didn™t do 
those stupid things, but that™s what was my  welcome. So 
Warsaw
 was a cemetery, 
Poland
 was no more for me. We passed the border 
and of course I went to this part 
of 
Germany
 which I was free. B efore we
 stop in  the Œ on th e way in 
Berlin
, she got 
the typhus from the German 
soldiers who were runnin
g away. I probably went 
through this in concentration camp, not kn
owing even  about. And Œ and we were Œ 

we got to spend, because she we
nt to hospital, excuse me, in 
Berlin
. And then after, 
in 1946, we got the Œ because the New 
Year™s Eve of 1945 
we spent still in 
Berlin
. 
And a few days later, officially the Americans took us Œ 

A2: It was American Œ

A: Œ from Œ because I was born in 
Germany
, so they took us back to 
Germany
 and 
since then we were there, waiting always 
that we™ll go someplace, and this waiting, 
waiting was til 1949. And what 
Œ our biggest mistake, es
pecially my, because at 
least my wife made it up, I didn™t, was th
at through this five years of being in  
Germany
 Œ 
A2: Three and a half. 

A: Œ we could start Œ 
we Œ four and a half. 
A2: Three and a half. 

A: Oh, th ree and a half. We could start 
anything we wanted, really, to educate 

ourself again, and I didn™t.  
Q: Where did you stay

You want only one nice thing Œ 
Q: You stayed there until Œ 
you stayed there until 19 Œ 
A: Œ one thing what happened in  
Eggenfelden
 where we were, was only that we 
will live to hear that
 Israel
 became independent country.

r the war? Did you 
become more religious because of
 your experiences in the war? 
A: No, as a matter of fact, as 
a matter of fact, to be honest Œ 
A2: Less. 
A: Œ I became less. I still don™t understand wh
at I saw, that I could not believe it,

little children, whose head were broken 
on the wall by Germans, and Œ and you 
could be religious after? No, I couldn™t. Wh
en I came  Œ I was always a Jew, but not 
religious, until when our son was born and st
arted to grow, I knew that I need to 
give him religion and the way I feel, I will 
not help him. So we
 decided to join a 
temple, and we joined a Reform one. My
 son always was comp laining th at my  
house is not religious enough, his will be 
more religious. Now, I don™t know, maybe 
yes, maybe not. 
A2: No, it™s not. 
A: I don™t think so. But he is re Œ a Jew. 

A2: A believer. 
A: Very active even here 
in second generation Ho locaust survivors. So are his 
children, who are here too,

A: Who was born Fe
bruary 16, 1959. 
Q: Have you talked to your ch
ildren about your experiences? 
A: Yes, but a little bit different maybe, th
at I was talking today. No, maybe not, 
maybe the same. I wasn™t scaring them. 
I was just telling them, and when they 
wanted more, I was telling more. My son 
wanted to hear mo re. My daughter didn™t 
want to hear at all. 
A2: Less. 
A: S Œ my son picked up ev
en Polish. We didn™t teach him. I dream still in Polish. 
I™m not ashamed because this was my languag e. Some people are thinking that this 
is awful. I don™t have anything against la
nguage, not even German language. I have 
against German people, not language. 
Q: What did you speak 
at home, did you sp Œ 
A: Polish. 
Q: Did you speak any Œ 
A: I understood Yiddish , but I didn™t sp
eak Yiddish, I don™t know how to speak 
today Yiddish, but I understand. I™m going
 to Jewish theater, and I understand. I 
don™t know only how to talk. If I talk, I talk
 German, which is very similar, but it™s 
not Yiddish. But my  son picked  
up Polish, and he Œ you couldn™t

My daughter hated every Polis
h word. But still, few months
 ago she proved Œ at the 
table I didn™t want the people to understand
 what I want, so I tu
rned to my son and I 
said in Polish that I want 
him to do. And she put the ha
nd, my  s Œ daughter put the 
hand on him, she got up and sh e did. Wh en  she came back I said, 
Edie
, you™re not 
supposed  to understand. Sh e says, I unders
tood. So it probably is. I know definitely 
that she is also Jewish, because Œ 
A2: She is from Jewi
sh mother, but Œ 
A: But anyway, anyway, my  son is probably 
Œ no, tradition I Œ I think I am as much 
as him, maybe even a little b
it more, even that we don™t 
light the candles on Friday 
and they  do. 
Q: Does the war still affect you?
 Your experi Œ you ex perience. 
A: Yes, I would say yes. I will say yes. 

Q: How? 

A: The best way to say that yes, our
 son wanted to come with us here. 
A2: Oh, he was 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Because he was feeling that is 
[indecipherable]
 especially we didn™t see the 
mu seum and he told  us not to see before. 
Yes. You know, I always had the insight. 
Me. Didn™t come out until I didn™t fight fo
r a bread in this country . When  I had 
already bread and butter, it came back. An
d I went for help. I went to Œ to a 

 
Interview with Joseph Koplewicz

psychiatrist. I was on Œ had how many mont
hs I don™t rememb er, sessions. And one 
day he told me that he can
not help me any mo re, and any time I want to come back, 
I can come. My son, who started as a pe
diatrician change and he became child 
psychiatrist, and he™s well know
n psychiatrist, not only in  
New York
, but also 
Washin gton. 
And so he understood that this will 
be hard, but we decided that we™ll 
do it. And like I said on the beginning, 
I am doing th is not 
only for them, but 
specially that are still p eople today wh
o are saying this didn™t exist.  
Q: Is there anything else 
that you would like to add? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Anything you want to share. 
A: That many, many times I was thinking
 about people who are saying that we 
should forget and forgive. 
Now, when it comes to forgiv
e, maybe if they would act 
differently. If they would come 
[indecipherable]
 and specially that
 the young ones 
who were not active and say our fathers, 
our grandfathers, brothers, uncles, did 
shame Œ we are not responsible for it, but 
it shouldn™t repeat, maybe this time I will 
say we should forgive them. Bu
t forget? Even that my wife
 in 1948 said that maybe
