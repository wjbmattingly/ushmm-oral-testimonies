er of Miami, Florida about her recollections of life 
in Austria before the war and about the story  ofher 
sister, Helene Lebel. Okay , Emmi, could you begin by  
telling us something abouty ourself and where y ou grew up and--. 
Emmi Lehner: 
I grew up in Vienna. In th e third district. 
Interview er: 
Third district. 
Emmi Lehner: 
In the Vorderezolla mt st rasse. This is 
a very nice se ction there because the 
Kriegsministeriu m is there and one arm of the Danube,
 a canal which is very pretty, very nice. I got 
married when  I was very young to theowner of the Imp erial Hotel, the son ofthe owner of the Imperial 
Hotel and lived there for three and a half y ears until 
'38 when Hitler mar ched in. I was at the hotel and 
Hitler was alr eady  in  the Furstner Apartment, we ca
lled that on th e second floorwhere alway s the roy alty  
would stay . It is a--wa s a r oy alty  hotel.They  asked 
us to leave, you know. When I was standing outside, 
they asked me to--Mr. Hitler would come on the ba
lcony  and we should sing theHorst Wessel song 
which I didn't know. Ididn't know any thing about Hitler too mu ch because in Vienna, we didn't know so 
mu ch about it. Then they didn't let us gothere. 
There was an SS man next to each person who stood in 
front of th e Imp erial Hotel. It took  approximately  an
hour and a half and then we left. I couldnot get in  
because they took th e whole hotel over. 
Interview er: 
This was in March, 1938? 
Emmi Lehner: 
1938,y es.On the 13th of March, 1938. No, I think it was the 11th, correct. The 11thof 
March. When I was marrie d , my  sister was out of th
e hospital. She was six mo nths in th e Allgemeinen 
Krankenhaus at the Potzel Clinic. 

Interview er: 
Six months, she was in which --? 
Emmi Lehner: 
In the Allgemeinen. It is the biggest--. 
Interview er: 
General Hosp ital. 
Emmi Lehner: 
General Hospital,y es. Sh e was there six months, first under Wagner Jauregg, then 
Wagner died, during the time Helli was in the hospita
l. Wagner Jauregg is one--was one of the biggest 
psy chiatrists in the world.Then Professor Potzel 
took over and Helene wa s there may b e three mo re 
months and then she was r eleas ed. 

Interview er: 
This was in 1934? 
Emmi Lehner: 
In 1934. 

Interview er: 
1934. Was that the first time she was in the hospital? 
Emmi Lehner: 
That was t h e first time s h e was in the hospital. As a matter of fac t , it was actua lly before 
that because Helli and I, we went every Sunday  to  th
e old Danube to  swi m. That particular Sunday , Helli 
acted very  strange. She said,y ou know,I hear consta
ntly  voices. She say s, I'm goinghome. I said, I just 
came here. I don't want togo ho me If y ou want togo home, go alone home. Wh en I came ho me, that 
night,there was a letter on the dining room table a
nd it was addressed to my  mo ther. I couldn't open it; I 
waited untilmy  mo ther came ho me. That letter she was 
not home. In that letter she said, I'm v ery  mu ch 
afraid y ou will be killed and I'm going to  take a train. But she didn't say  exactly where she's g o ing. But 
around 12 o'clock at night,she came back. She was ve
ry  restless and very  strange. My  mo ther called her 
sister and her sister w as ver y  friendly  with a doc
tor who worked at th e Allgemein en Krankenhaus. She 
called and said what should I do? She said bringher in
 immediately. That was like a crisis center here. 
Where y ou take people---like a--where y
ou take people when they  are, you know. 
Interview er: 
Do youknow when this was, this first time? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Helene was19. 
Interview er: 
Nineteen.  
Emmi Lehner: 
Born in '11. 
Interview er: 
1930. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, that 's what it was. I  was alre ady  
with my  husband, I wasn't married y et. 
Interview er: 
You had a fiancee. Then? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Helli went in and was six months in the hosp
ital. After the six months, she came out and 
we decided to get married and Helli was at the wedding. 
Interview er: 
So there was a four-y ear period from this first --? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, she w ent to Graz to my  grandmo ther and 
went to the university . In Vienna, she went 
to the university and then she got a job during the 
time she went to the university she got a jobin a 
lawy er's office. 

Interview er: 
This is in Vienna? 
Emmi Lehner: 
In Vienna. 
Interview er: 
So she went to Graz with your grandmother? 
Emmi Lehner: 
With grandmother and st ay ed there. I wasalr eady married. She was at the w e dding. We 
had a very , very  large wedding,400 guests. 

Interview er: 
She was there  for a long time, in Graz?  
Emmi Lehner: 
In Graz, w ell she was th ere, I would say  seven or eight months. She ca me back and ca me 
to my  house and smoked a lot. At that time, I didn't know any thing about smoking. Helli smo k ed and 
Helli said to me, I'm going home now and bringyoua
ll your books, the schoolb
ooks. I said,no; don't 
bring me that because I don't want them here at the hotel. I lived at th e hotel, the Imp erial Hotel . I said no, 

no, don't bring it. She left.Then in the ev ening, 
my  mo ther called and said Helli was taken to Steinhof. 
There she was may b e--. In1938, we decided to leave. 
We decided actually  already in January  to  leave but 

we didn't leav e and didn't leave, and then Hitler marchedin. We left at that night when he marched in. We 
wanted to goto Hungary  wh ere we had very  goodfriends but th ey did no t let usgo in th ere. The 
Hungarians made it plain; we can 't go back to Vie
nna. It was very exciting because there was the SS and 
the SA. We were very  lucky .  One of the men, w
ho belonged to the SS, my  husband didn't know, was an 
employ ee of th e hotel. He recognized my  husband andhe made a cordon and said:It's Mr. Walter Lehner, 
its okay , let hi m go out. He didn't ask us where we want
ed to go, we wanted to--. My mo ther was with us 
and we said we are going on vacation to  Hungary , to 
Budapest. That man didn't think anything , was one 
of ourdetectives fro m the hotel, that hewas alr
eady  a Nazi. So we went back and my  husband 
i mmediat ely  tried to get out because my  husband was of
 the militar y  age. Twenty -six or some thing like 
that. We heard already  that the Ger mans would start 
a war and he wouldbe called up. They  wanted to 
take the Austrians first so he tried andwent before
 I left. A month or so beforeI left, he went to 
Switzerland. We had--the daughter of th e hotel was owne
d by  a friend of his fath er He went, left; and I, 
on the 14thor 15thof July ,I went to see Helli, my  sister
 for the last time. I went t o  the Steinhof and didn't 
say  goodby e to  her because I didn't want her to knowth at I'm l eaving for good. But she had some kind of 
premonition.She was not bad; she was very good-be
haved, very well and looked very good. I said 
goodby e andshe said, well , when doyou think I see you 
again? Ididn't answer that very  mu ch; I said 
very  soon and left. It was the last ti me I saw her. It w as in '38. 
Interview er: 
July of 1938? 
Emmi Lehner: 
July  of 1938 . 
Interview er: 
How long had she been inSteinhof? 
Emmi Lehner: 
She was th ere for about--she came out in Ch
ristma s when I was already  married. Just a 
second, can you ho ld that--- (interruption) 

Interview er: 
Yes, I will. We were talking abouty ou 
leaving in July, 1938 andyouvisited--. 
Emmi Lehner: 
On the 15th, on the 11th, 13th or so. I went to see her, to see Hell i to say goodby e--in my  
own mind, but not to  her. 

Interview er: 
Right, righ t.Andy o u said she lookedgood and she was well-behaved. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, she was very  well-behaved. I don't know 
ify ou are familiar- all mental hospitals 
have pavilions. In this pavilion, 
th e people move around. For instance,
 if y ou are very bad,you go to 
another pavilion. Whenyou are very good,you can go  
in a pavilion  where they have ty pewriters, sewing 
machines, wh atever y o u want to do,y ou can do there. 
They have their occupy the patients quite a bit,y o u 
know. Only if they 're good. So Helen was at that
 time --number one is very bad and numb er--u p to 
numbers--she was in numb er nine which is a very goo
d one. Butthere wer e many time s when I was there 
when she was not, when she was in number two. But th is time she was in nine and I felt very good, that 

she looked good, her hair is nicely done and she look ed good. Then I--. 
Interview er: 
How long--the question I had asked when the doorbell rang, was how long had sh e been at 
Steinhof? 

Emmi Lehner: 
Well, fro m--when she w as nineteen, it started. She went first to the Allge mein en 
Krankenhaus for six months. Then she came out and 
the next time she did not goto the Allgemeinen 
Krankenhausi she went directly  to  Steinhof. My  mo ther
 tookher but I was with her. We had the hotel car 
and we tookher. She was very disturbed. She was very difficult. 

Interview er: 
When wouldthat have been? 

Emmi Lehner: 
That was i n , I would say, '34. I was married alr ea dy  ay ear. In,'35. 
Interview er: 
'35. so that's the first time she went to Steinhof? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes.  
Interview er: 
Before that, it was the Allgemeine?  
Emmi Lehner: 
Allgemeinen Krankenhaus,y es. Potzel Clinic.It's called the Potzel Clinic which is the 
psy chiatric depart ment. Then Helli came out the same 
y ear for Christ mas but she couldn't stay .She said 
take me back.  I can™ t standthe noise andI can™ t sta
nd the lights, I can't stand the furniture. Shedid not 
want to stay  and that was the last time she was out
. We had to takeher back to Steinhof and then we 
visited her.We had to restrict our visiting times. I 
w ent three time s; my  mo ther went three times, to see 
her so metimes four times. Then' 38 came along. That 
was a very  tragic thing andI didn't thinkthat 
any thing would happen toHelli because she was in th e hospital. When--the mo ment the war broke out, I 
had no mo re opportunity .As long as there was no war, I was in England fo r twoy ears, youknow, we 
could not immigrate to the United States right away .We
 were waiting for a quota number. We stay ed in 
England with friends. I had alway s letter from Mother and Helli putalway s little notes in say ing, hello 

Emmi, how is it? Like it in England?  And I'm fine. 
Things like--. Very  short notes. Then when the war 
broke out, there was no communication until I went to  
the Red Cross. They  were only very  short note and 
all of a sudden I didn 't hear anything  from my  parents, or from my sister, or any thing. Th at went 
apparently into  ' 40 when th ey  started to empty  out the Steinhof, took all mental patients out and killed 
them. But I didn't--my  mo ther never wrote me that. 
Interview er: 
She was in--. 
Emmi Lehner: 
The letter which I gave you. I found in  my  mo ther's desk, after my  mo ther's death. She 
had never sent me that letter, nor did shetell me any t
hing. She said I cannot visitHelli, it is so far away . 
My  mo ther was at that ti me  in Poznan. 

Interview er: 
Poznan, I know. 
Emmi Lehner: 
She had no opportunity to go and visit Helli.
 But ithappened very fast because in '40 
when the war  broke out, they  took th em all away  
because they needed the A
llgemeine, the Steinhof for 
the soldiers. That's what my  mo ther told me when 
she ca me to visit me the firs t time in A me rica. She 
never elaborated on Helli's death. You know, I w
as very  mu ch anti-Ger man, alway s. Because I knew 
what Ger man y wanted from us. My  mo ther knew that
 and she didn™ t' want to elaborate what these 
Germans all did. My  father had a position in a German
 hospital in Poznan. Shenever elaborated on that. 
She never said, I guess that Helli is still alive, didyou
 hear from Helli? Until that
letter came, t h at letter 
she never me ntioned to  me . I found it in her d
esk when I ca me the f irst ti me to V ienna. 
Interview er: 
So Helli was in Steinhof from early  1936 until
 she was transferred to Germany ? She was 
never releas e d  again? 

Emmi Lehner: 
Never rel e ased again. Apparently  she had gotten worse. I really don't know.My  mo ther 
never talked about itverymu ch but sheknew how much
 1--. Helene and I were very, very  close. We 
were just like  twins. She knew every thing she would 
tell me which is negative,she would know that it 
would hurt me very  mu ch. So I didn't hear it until 
when  I went in 1971, I went toVienna becau se my  
mo ther w as v ery  sick. Four weeks later s h e died. Then
 I cleared out the apart ment  and I found the letter. 
The particulars what she had from H elli , her birth certificate and things like that. 

Interview er: 
Now, I've seen one photograph of Helli and she's holding--? 

Emmi Lehner: 
Ly di, ou r do g . 
Interview er: 
Liddy? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Ly di was our dog. L-y -d-i. 
Interview er: 
L-y -d-i. Andit looks like a terrier. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, she 's a fox terrier. My  fatherhad a kennel.
 We had quite abit of them and my  father 
sold them. She was our dog. Helli's and my  dog. Sh e came fro m England, a 
female. She came from 
England, from one of my  cousins andwe loved her to death. Tillshe died. 
Interview er: 
Yeah, so that was--?  
Emmi Lehner: 
Helli and I, we were every summer in Gri
mmenstei n . This is a very  famous lung 
sanatoriu m.  My  father was a business with the pol--, like a director. He had, himself, lung trouble and was 
not supposedto be invienna. So we wen t every  su
mmer for two mo nths there. All the time we were off 
school. Helli and I we had a wonderful ti me there. Ther
e was no sign that she wouldbe mentally  ill. That 
was when w e  were may b e, I ten, and Helene, eleven. 
We were sixteen months apart. From that time on 
until I married, I was alway s in  Grimmenstein with he
r. Then when she was nineteen, she got sick. That 
was the first t i me she got sick. 
Interview er: 
Didy ou justspend the summers there or--? 
Emmi Lehner: 
We spent the whole summer there. W e could not
 stay  in the lung sanatorium.  We had to 
be in a separate house witha Fraulein,y ou know. We had wonderful times; there was no sign th at she 
could ever be sick. 
Interview er: 
The first signwas that --?  
Her birthday 's in Septemb er. They  saidsu mmer we we
re on the old Danube. Before we were supposed to 
go to Grimmenstein. But it started when she was 19 y ears old, September 15, she was 19. 

Interview er: 
So Ly di wasyour dog and--? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Was our dog, Helli andmy  dog. I lo ved--we love
d--Helli too, loved the dog so  mu ch. She 
was in Gri mmenstein many times becau se, excuse me sir,
 leave me that form ther e please. I cannot sign it 
right now. Just a mo ment. 

Interview er: 
And we were talking abou tLydi was your dog and I was going to asky ou, ho w long did 
youhave--when didyou first get Lydi 
and how longdidy ou have her? 
Emmi Lehner: 
When I was marri ed oney ear, I marri ed in '34. In '35 I told  Helli when I visited her that 
Lydi is now in Grimmenst ein because s h e had an eczema which went all over her body .  Shewas ten y ears  
old at that time. I was marri ed already  ayear and I 
said to my  husband, I'd like togo to Grimmenstein one 
mo r e ti me and say goodbye to Ly dibecause we hear
d about all the things which were happening th at 
may b e Ger many  willget in to Austria,you know. I went up; I wanted to see her one mo re ti me. She was 
very  sick at that time and, I think, a few months later she died. 
Interview er: 
Lydi died? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Not in ourhouse, not inmy  mo ther's house, 
but inGrimmenstein. My  fatherhad a kennel 
there which had a man and wo man tookcare of her. 

Interview er: 
The reason why  I was asking that, was Helli especial ly attached to Ly di? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yeah. Hell i alway s walked her. One day ,  th
is were the signs which come to my mind 
now, that when Helli start ed--. You see, this ty peof
sickness Helli had starts usually inpuberty from girl-
-. 
Interview er: 
Thirteen y ears old? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, no, it didn't start that way .  It starte
d, I think, around when Iwas sixteen and Helli 
was seventeen and a half.There were signs. Signs like she took Lydi for a walkto the inner city of 
Vienna which is very  crowded alwa
y s. Lydi had to wear a mu zzl e because in Aus t ria it was the  rule; all 
dogs had to wear mu zzles. She took  him and then sh
e went into a department store and left the dog 
outside. Shewas very  well-trained.
 Youdidn't have to ha
ve her ona leash, y o u know. She was alway s 
walking nexttoy ou. My  father knew dogs very 
well and she was very  well-trained. Helli went out 
another side and forgot thedog. We were besides our
selves. I was already  married at that time. But the 
dog came home and y ou know this is may b e half anhour walk from the inner ci ty to th e address wher e 

we lived. She ca me by herself and the muzzle wa s on the side. Was  not on her. 
Interview er: 
She hadn't been arrested?  
Emmi Lehner: 
No, she was not arrested. She walked by  he
rself home. Helli was na
turally  very  happy 
that she came. But Helli was alway s with the dog. I 
got married and I had my  own dog. I bought my  own 
dog, anotherwire-haired fox terrier. 
Interview er: 
Yes. I wa s going to ask ifthere was any conn
ection between Helli 's worsening situation in 
'35 and the death of the do g? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Well, it wa s not really connected because she 
had the ecze ma, sh e had this very bad skin 
rash because she was plucked all the time. We tri mme
d her all the ti me, what she should lo ok like. She 
was a very  beautiful dog. Idon't think ithad any  co
nnection with Helene, no. Helene started with like 
forgetting th e dog. This is -you can do this but as a 
rule, you don't.Very  little signs which started. When 
she was at this lawy er's, w h en she took this job at 
thelawy er's offic e as part se cr etary  and went to the 
university ,  we had a--each of us 
had a ring from our father, a black p
earl ring. Helli came home and called  
me. I was at the hotel and sh e called me for a mo ment
 and said,y ou know, I was so sad today , there was a 
lady washingthe floor in the university . She's ther e,
 I gave her my  ring. Inearly droppeddead because 
this ring was the only thing we had from our father, our 
real father. I  went to call my  mo ther right away  
and said~ what happened?She said Helli is so stra
nge. She goes out in the middle of the nigh t, around 
one 0' clock, two 0' clock, all of a sudden I h
ear the door go and Helli's gone. My mo ther was v ery  
concerned. Young girls don't go out at night,youknow. She tookher clothes; she looked around; she 
couldn't findher. Around two o'clock, she would come 
back. Then she walked at night. Sh ewent out--we 
had a very  large hallway  from the entran ce to th
e living room. Helli would walkup anddown, up and 
down. That's when my  mo ther called her sister 
who had a friend in th e Allgemein en Krankenhaus, a 
doctor. And sh e said youhave to bring her in, we woul
d like to testher and see her. From that time on, 
she got worse and worse,. Then came th at Sunday , wh
en we were at the Danube and she disappeared and 
she said I hear such voices. What are these voices aro
und me? It was the beginning ofher sickness. When 
we talked to all the doctors, they  thoughtit was schizo phrenia. 
Interview er: 
From that ti me on, schizophrenia? 
Emmi Lehner: 
At that ti me, let me tell you,knowing so mu ch
 about mental hospitals because Peter had--
that really  had no connections with Peter.Peter had a brain-damage when he was born. 

Interview er: 
You're talking aboutyourPeter? 
Emmi Lehner: 
My  son,y es. Because many people think because 
Helli had that, that this is inherited; it is 
not. Ithas nothing to  do with Peter. We found out, my mo ther found out that when  she was a y ear and a 
half old, shehad a very --we went on a Danube trip 
on a Sunday . You know witha ship on th e Danube. 
Helli got a high fever, a very high fever and was very , 
very sick. The doctors at that time knew very  little 
about mental illness. They know Freud and they know Wagner Jaurich study ing th e sicknesses in the 

mental patien ts. But they  know not really as mu ch 
as they donow,that there is some balance i n  the 
situation in the brain,y o u know. They  know so mu
ch mo re now than they  did when Helli was sick. I 
really  don't know. They  treated them ver y  nice in th
ehospital, I have to say that. Because Hell i was 
alway s very clean, very neat. You couldnot go  in th eroom where they  slept. They  had many  people, 

there. There were no single rooms or two-bed rooms 
likey ouhave here. It was mo re like 10or 12people 
in a hall, they  call it a hall, youknow. Wh en we went
 there, Helli would come out. You'd never go to the 
bedroom; y ou never saw her bed or any thing like th at
.She came out and then th ere were little rooms 
where people were allowed to go with th e patients, the patients who are behaving  well. You know, there 

were patients there who attacked their mothers and fa
thers and visitors. I was atta cked once by a patient 
who was just let out from the sleeping area. I wore a hat 
and she tore my  hat off.I was s cared t o  death but 
then Helli came and Helli was al way s 
very  good. She behaved very well. 
Interview er: 
She would only be with female patients? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, y es. There were onl y --male and fe mal e wer e s eparated- sep arate pavilions. 
Interview er: 
I thought we'd goback a little bit to th e beginning. Mention that Helli was born in 
September, 1911 andy ouwere sixteen months y o ung er? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Thirteen, 7th of March 1913. 
Interview er: 
March 7, 1913 andyou were the only  two children? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Only  two ch ildren,y es. 
Interview er: 
Were y o u at that time, living in the th irddistrict or --? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, no. We lived at ourgrandmother.  My mo ther beca me a wido w when she was 21, 
when my  father went to wa r and was shot in Russia. We lost our father. 

Interview er: 
That was in 1914? 
Emmi Lehner: 
No, my  father was--didn't go to war. My  mo th
er hided him. He didn't want to go to war. 
He never wan ted to shoot or do any thinglike this. He 
had no training in it. His father was a--ha d  a mo st 
beautiful store in Vienna of antique pictures like Va
n Gogh's and very ,very  fam
ous painters.My  father 
was supposed to go to America to deliver a Van Gogh, 
I think it was, to the Vanderbilt™s in  America. He 
was a gamb l e r. My  fatherwas, unfortunately , not on
good terms with his father
because he was a gamb ler 
quite a bit, roulette, youknow, casinos in France He l o
st that picture and came b ack. The war broke out 
and my  mo ther did hidehim for two y ears. In '14 the war broke out, in '16, they got him--they sent him on 
the Russian front; andonemonth later h e died, he was killed. 
Interview er: 
So he was killed in 1916? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes. We were very y oung and my  mo ther became a Red Cross nurse. During the war, 
every body had to do somet h ing. She beca me a Red 
Cr oss nurse and met my  stepfather as a pati ent. He 

was shot in the shoulder and lost a lotofblood. My  mo ther was one of his nurses there. They  fell in love 
and ma rried when they were very young because my
 mo ther was around21.She was 16 when she got my  
sister.  
Interview er: 
Your stepfather was a patie nt in herhospital?  He was a soldier?  
Emmi Lehner: 
He w as a s o ldier, a regular soldier. Even so
 he hadMatura, had very  good schooling and 
shouldhave been an officer . But because he didn't an
swer the call o f his duty right away , th ey made hi m 
as a regular s o ldier. One month later hewas dead. So th
at was the beginning of avery hard time for us but 
we wer e very lucky  because my  stepfather was wonderfu
l. He was a very ,very --he loved us;he was very  
good to us. Iwould say hepreferre
d me mo re than Helli. Helli alway s criticized him, y ouknow, you're 
not my  father, don't tell me  this. You're not my  real 
father, things like that Helli would say. Bu t he was 
very good tous, all his life untilhe died.

Emmi Lehner: 
He married  my  mo ther in 1926. 
Interview er: 
His na me wa s--?  
Emmi Lehner: 
Artur Celebrini. Like A-B, C-e-l-e-b-r-i-n-i. 
Interview er: 
That's an Italian name.  
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes. Hi s fa ther was fro m Fiume I think, and his mo ther was fro m Austria. 
Interview er: 
Your mo ther,  her name wa s also E mma.  
Soy ou were named after y our mo ther? 
Emmi Lehner: 
E mma? Helli and I, we had one godmother a
nd hername was Melani. We have bothour 
middle names are Melani. Helli was M e lani Lebel, L-e-b-e-l and Emma-- 

Interview er: 
Melani, can you spell thatplease? 
Emmi Lehner: 
M-e-l-a-n-i .  Melani. The girl like in Gone With theWind. 
Interview er: 
So Helene Melani Lebel. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Helli, that's H-e-l-e-n-e. She was probably  in
 when  she was in the hospital under Lebel. 
You know there's an accen t sign on the last "e".
 That's why we say Lebel, and not Lebel. 
Interview er: 
Yes, so there 's an acc ent on the last ‚e™ ? 
Emmi Lehner: 
The last e, an accent sig n  on there. 
Interview er: 
French sty l e? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yeah, well  he ca me fro m Fr ench des cent. 
Interview er: 
Now what rel igion were--? 
Emmi Lehner: 
We were alway s Catholic. 
Interview er: 
Catholic. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Alway s. When I marri ed, I married-in the, what
y o u call it, not inthe Church because my  
husband's fat h er was J ewis h , his mo ther was a Christi an.
 I didnotwant to become Jewish or any thing like 

that. I was seveny ears in a convent andthey were--in 
Vienna. I just didn't want to change my  religion. I 
wasn 't a religious person but I didn't want to change it. 
Interview er: 
You were baptized in theCatholic religion? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, I w as baptized. 
Interview er: 
Bothy ou and Helli were 
raised as Catho lics? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, a s Cat holics, we we re in the convent together. 
Interview er: 
Your mo ther was al so Catholic? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, C atholic, my  stepfa ther was Cath olic too. 
Interview er: 
Your stepfather was C atholic. What abouty our father? 
Emmi Lehner: 
My  fatherwas consider ed--in his birth certifi
cate which I found in my  mo ther's desk. He 
was ﬁconfessi onslosﬂ (without religion)since he 
was sixteen. He was fro m Jewish parents but 
confessionslos. 
Interview er: 
So he was of Jewish anc est ry? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, absol u tely. 
Interview er: 
This is Alfred now. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, Alfr e d . I never met  his mo ther. My grandmother I never met because th ey  were 
divorced, my grandfather and my  grandmother. 
She went to Germany  and I never met her. 
Interview er: 
Would Lebelhave been considered a Jewish name?  
Emmi Lehner: 
I think it wouldbe,y es. 
Interview er: 
So the people at the hospital would haveknown? 
Emmi Lehner: 
They  would have known but I telly ou frankly . 
I have a friend who was half-Jewish, half-
Gentile and nothing happened to them in Austria. I 
don't think they did anythi
ng to Helli because she was 
Jewish, I really don't know. 

Interview er: 
Even after the Nazi s ca me in? 
Emmi Lehner: 
The Nazis decided all mental patients should 
be killed. They  hadnot enough food, no t 
enough shelter for them. Di dn't want to use the hospita
ls for mentall y  sick people. You see that the bad 
part was that she was a lengthy  there. There was no in
terruptions,that she was better, she could come out 
or things likethat,y o u know. She was constantly  ther
e and decided probably that she was really mentally  
ill. 
Interview er: 
I reme mber although I don't know if it was fro m y ouor from Trudy , that she was supposed 
to be released ? 
Emmi Lehner: 
That I don't know. Trudy  knows mo re--. I'll te
ll y ou what happened. Trudy knows mo re 
about my  parents during the war because she was in Italy  
and my  father, when he finally gotou t of jail,he 
was arr ested by  the Russians and was a y ear in jail 
wh en my  mo ther got him out. He went to Italy --he 
spoke fluent Italian and hewent to Trudy, stay ed w
ith Trudy .Thenmy  mo ther came fro m Austria to him. 

This period is very dark with  me because ther
e was a war ony ouknow and we had--there was no 
possibility  totalk lengthywith 
them, or  see them or any thing. 
Interview er: 
Yes. The new s that I heard was that they were 
told that she was bette r and that she would be 
released soon. Instead of being released,  she was--the notice was that she was tr ansferred to another 
hospital in Germany . 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes and my mo ther really thought itwas a hospital. 
Interview er: 
In fact the name of the hospital was Niedernhart, which I think is in  Bavaria. 
Emmi Lehner: 
My  mo ther said it was very  far from where she w a s when they were in Poznan. She said 
there is no chance for me t o  travel there. 

Interview er: 
Although they  really  senther to 
Brandenburg which is near Berlin. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, that is what I heard. In one of my  letters fro m t h e Red Cross that Helli is in 
Brandenburg. That's what my  mo ther wrote. But 
I thought it was a hospital. I didn't know Germany . 
Interview er: 
The reason I was asking, those questions abouty o
ur father was that in July ,1940,  the Nazis 
ordered that all Jewish patients in me
ntal hospitals, and in wards and in clinics and so forth, beremoved 
and sent to be killed. That in cluded Mischlinge. 

Emmi Lehner: 
I guess that's probably  so. 
Interview er: 
Yeah and I would th ink that they  wouldhave known-- 
Emmi Lehner: 
I tell you frankly  whenmy  husbanddecided rightaway  to leave because he had a Jewish 
father and he was broughtup in th e Jewish religion. In 
the end when we left, we were remarried in a very  
little church in  Grinzing somewhere. I 
really  can't rememb er 
where that was because 
when he decided, he 
does not kn ow y et, hegoes to Englandor he goes to 
Australia. His  sister went to Australia, my husband's 
sister. To Australia, y o u couldnot come in as a Jew
; youhad tobe a Catholic. -- Lily , who was Jewish 
too and married- had a Jewish husband;th ey decide
d to  become Catholics. My  husband became a 
Catholic toobut the reason before, hewas a devout Jew
 actually ,but the reason he became Catholic was 
only  for getting into some place. Then we decided to 
go to England. We had frie
nds in England which we 
had no money so we had to  dependon 
our friends. But it is possible that what they  saidbefore and what 
they do afterwards is entirely different, youknow, an
d they  probably didknow th at Helene was Jewish. 
Interview er: 
The name, y eah. They  didn't pay  attention to re
ligion. They  looked at
 it as heredity, race--. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Probably  and if I wouldhave stay ed,because in
 the beginningwe wanted W alter to go by 
himself, and then I come w h en he sees w h at he is goingto do, ifhe is goingto stay  in England, or if he 
can go to America or things like that. We didn't know
 that. We were very  lu cky , we had a very good 
friend here in Ameri ca wh o gave us theaffidavit 
butyou couldn't.You see the difference now here and 
now everybody  can come to America. I don't understand 
it. We had to wait twoand a halfy ears before 
our quota came through. In  these two and a halfy ears,
 we had nomoney ; we we
re solely  supported by 
friends. Selling whatever jewelry  I had to  wait for th
e affidavit to co me to America. Actually ,youknow, 
in Americ a, my  husband really  got a job may b e after  si
x weeks be ing inthe United States. He  got a job in 
New Jersey  but we wanted to go to  Florid a because my husband isa hotel man, youknow, was a hotel 
man. 
Interview er: 
When didyou come to America? 

Emmi Lehner: 
In 1940, April, 1940. 
Interview er: 
So rightin the middle of the war? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, w e w ere es corted by U-boats and plan
es on top and secret s ervice which we didn't 
know the name of the boat or any thing. We were
 sent to Manchester. We went from London to  
Manchester a nd from Manchester w e w ere with sec re t po
lice to the boat. It was very  exciting, we were 14 
day s on  the--we went fro m there to zigzag to Green
land. In Greenland we went back, it was a long, long  
trip. The reason for that was becau
se the English sentall their pictures fro m the galleries and the gold in 
that particular boat. We were not escorted becau
se we were J ewish i mmigrants. We were esc orted 
because of the jewel s and the gold and the pictures whic
h were in the sa me boat where we we re. Very  bad 
trip, we had to have gas masks, the whole thing all 
the ti me bec aus e we w ere ch ased by  German U-boats. 
Interview er: 
What couldyou say aboutgrowing up?Little girls? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Growing up in Austria--you see, I'm h ere now 51years in the United States. I came in 
April '40. 
Interview er: 
Fifty - two. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Practic ally 52y ears,y es. I can tell you I have
 been never so happy as being here in the 
United States. I love this country , I think Austria is a great and beautiful coun try to travel throughbut I 
couldn™ t --. When I was back, I was back every  secondy ear to see my mo ther, y ou know, after th e war, 
when my  mo ther ca me bac k , when Peter was born. But for some r ea son, I felt alway s as a stranger there. I 
can't understand Trudy. I cannot understand it--that she 
would prefer to stay there. I think Trudy would 
prefer to stay there because  I can't i m
agine going twice a y ear to Austria. 
Interview er: 
Well the latest word is thatshe's lonely
 and home sick. And wants to come back.  
Emmi Lehner: 
I can 't  believe this. Well,y o u know what sh
e's homesick for?  Trudy  loves New York and 
she loves the opera. Really this is her bigg est thing.
 She goes to it two or three times to the opera. I don't 
know what itis in Austria, what she sees there. I 
mean  here in America where y ou have freedom and 
where y o u have every thing. You knowAustria is a very  small cou n try  andvery -- I didn't feel at home. I 

was there three time s after I left. I tellyou fra
nkly. Iwas alway s so glad to come back. 
Interview er: 
Well you andy our sister,you grew up--it mu st have b een difficult because y ourfather died 
and then it was a w ar going on? 

Emmi Lehner: 
Yes. We w ere really  supported by theA meri cans af ter the war.  
Interview er: 
This is after World War I? 
Emmi Lehner: 
After Worl d War I, theAmeri cans gave us food.Without th ese packages wh ich my  
mo ther picke d  up every  week, we wouldn't survive. It
 was so bad. My  mo ther had to go withTrudy 's 
mo ther and another sister to the country and give them
 their rings and whatever they  had. The farmers had  
eggs and chickens and things like that. 

Interview er: 
Who took care ofy ou andHelli when you were little girls? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Well, y ouknow we hada pensi
on, Helene and I had a pensi
on after our father was killed 
in the war. We had a small pension which my  mo ther
 really  livedon until my  father got a job in  
Gri mmenstei n  where he was a V erwalt e r. 

Interview er: 
He wa s y ourstepfather?  
Emmi Lehner: 
My  stepfather. Then things were mu c h  bette
r. We had a very  beautiful home which was 
my  grandfather's ho me and we lived in a very good neighborhood. 
Interview er: 
Grandfather Celebrini or--? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Grandfather Lebel. We had a very nice ap
artment. We had my  mo ther's--I don't know 
how she did it--I tell you frankly  I thought it over what sh
e had to do to surviv e.But when my  father got a 
job, hehad to stay  away  from Vi enna. You know 
the cobblestone tiles where we had to walk horses and 
things, th e concrete splintered off. It was very ba
d for people with lung trouble.He had only one lung . 
One lung was taken out and he was very, very  sick. Wh
en I was sev en or eight and Helene was nine or 
ten, my  father was may b e seven months in the hospital. He nearly  died there of tuberculosis. Then he was 
sent to Gri mmenstein, to a sanatorium t h ere and ther
e he got his job. His unclewas a doctor too. His 
father was a doctor and hehad very  man y  friends in
 the medic al cen ter. We survived. When Iwas 14, 
things were mo re normal. Since we lived in a very
 goodneighborhood, we went to a good school. I went 
to Ursulinen,the Catholic school--. 
Interview er: 
You went toa Catholic school? 
Emmi Lehner: 
I went to a Catholic school. 
Interview er: 
And Helli? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Helli too. 
Interview er: 
Catholic grade school? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Grade school. I was there until I was in the--whatyou would call-- 
Interview er: 
Junior high? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Junior high. JuniorhighI went to thecenter of the city ,to a public school buta very good 
public school. Because, y ou know, in Vienna things ar
e very divided. For in stance, working-class people 
live in the tenth district and white-c
ollar workers in the first and second, th irddistricts. Second district is 
co mp letely  Jewish. 
Interview er: 
Yes, the Leopold Stadt. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, the Leopold Stadt. Co mp letely  Jewish. 
It was still rather segregated there. The 
reason for that was mo stly  that many  of the girls--these girls marrie d  Jewish men .  These Jewi s h men 
ca me either fr om Poland or Russia, there  was a--  
Interview er: 
Or Hungary? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Hungary or Czechoslovakia. There were 
so many  mixed marriages here. The Jewish 
people had, Idon't know,made mo re 
money , I always thought they  had mo re money  than th e other 
people. We did nothave any thing--I belonged to a club . I play ed land ho ckey when I was 14.In that club, 
were I don't know what, were regular people, I neve
r asked a person what religion are y ou. You know, 
that was not--we never spoke about it. Iwas not prepar
ed in religion when I was 14 so I was seven y ears 
in a convent. 
Interview er: 
A convent. 

Emmi Lehner: 
I hated that, going to church on Sunday. My  
mo ther never forced me to. So when Helli 
and I, we were both from religion, 
hadmany  Jewish friends. From the 
club where I belongedto and they  
are say ing that all these people, I heard they  left Vienna after Hitler came. But they were all probably  
Jewish or part-Jewish or whatever. We neve
r really  talked about th is very  mu ch. 
Interview er: 
Yeah. Did y ou have any --? 
Emmi Lehner: 
We foundafter Hitler th at may b e 50% were for the Anschluss. I tell you frankly , my  
father wouldsay  to me look if things will be mu chbetter when we are annexed to Germany . In  our time, 
schools, first grade schools, junior high ,you were 
alway s anti-German, why ,  Idon't know. Iwasn 't 
politically  info rmed enough to know why Austria was so
 against Germany . I loved Vienna naturally and I 
didn't want to get togetherwith Ge
r many. The Ger ma n s are really  very different than we are. We speak 
may b e the same language; also I cannot understand the Berliner. They  speak a different German. 
Interview er: 
Buty ou andHelli attended grade school and juni
or high Catholic? And then afterwards--?  
Emmi Lehner: 
After that, we went to public school. 
Interview er: 
The gy mn asi um?  
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, we went to gy mn asiu m. I went only  thr
ee y ears and then I switched to a--I was very  
good in drawing--I went toKunstgewerb eschule. This
 is where y oulearn drawing and things like--and 
any thing todo with painting and handcrafts and things
 like that-. Iwent there and then I wentto the hotel 
school. Oneyear at the hotel school; there's where I me
t my  husband. Her father was the--. He was the ---
--. When I married, I was the --. His father thought I should do something. 
Side B
 
Interview er: 
I just want toask a little bit mo re aboutHelli's studies. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Well, Helli  was an especially bright person. 
Interview er: 
Yes.  
Emmi Lehner: 
Very , very bright. Sh e was not good in  school,butshe was very  good in geog raphy , 
whatever I wanted to know about homework and I didn't know what to do, I was not a goodstudent, I 
went--I asked  Helli and Helli alway s knew. Helli was another onewho went to th e opera all the time. She 
loved op era. Naturally  we could on ly  afford stehpl
atz like Trudy did when she was a y o ung girl. But we 
were very  close to Trudy  and Otto,very close becaus e  we wer e (the children of) the twoy o ungest sister s 

and they  were alway s together. We went to Sommer
f rische, vacati on, outside of Vienna. Tante Melli was 
very  well-off. She married a very  rich man, had a very good business. We w ere alway s together. We had 

one Fraulein together, we were al way s together. So
meti me s when we were little, we spent--. Trudy  left, 
Trudy  left for Italy . I thinkit was the y ear before. 
Interview er: 
‚37.  
Emmi Lehner: 
'37, y es. Th en naturally every thingbroke apart. 
Interview er: 
Now did Helli want to be any thing in particular? 
Emmi Lehner: 
She wante d  to be a lawy er. 
Interview er: 
A lawy er. 

Emmi Lehner: 
That's why she was in a law office an dwent to theuniversity  tostudy  law. 
Interview er: 
So she finished gy mn asiu m and then she atte
nded the university . You said in Graz and in 
Vienna? 
Emmi Lehner: 
In Vienna. In Graz, I understood thatwhen she 
went with my  step grandmother, she went 
to the university for lectures and things like that. She 
was al way s intellectual, I have to say that. But then, 
youknow, after I married and she started--she became sick. 

Interview er: 
So she was a student until '35? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes.  
Interview er: 
And she was a part-ti me le gal secret ary ? 
Emmi Lehner: 
A legal secretary  and she started there--the
 lawy er called my  mo ther and said youknow 
there's so mething wrong with Helli. Shesits all the time on the window and talk s to the people outside. 
She would go to the window and call people who walked
 by . He said if she doesn 't change that very 
mu ch, I don't think I cankeep her. I think Helene ca
me home and it really  started with her. Because the 
day  my  mo ther took her wh en we were told totake 
her to the Allgemeine in the car fro m the hotel and I 
took my  mo ther and Helli and Tante Melli to the hospital, to the Allg emeinen Krankenhaus. Th ere she 

was six months, very  bad.Very  bad th en--now this 
was really  very bad. For Christ ma s we c a me with 
Christ ma s tre e and presents and all that and she thre
w it out. She had a bad spelland she was very  bad--
had to put her in restraints. 
Interview er: 
This was after youhad married? 
Emmi Lehner: 
I was alr ea dy  marri ed. Every thing was bad. Brokemy  heart bec ause--.  
Interview er: 
There was little you coulddo? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Very  littleI could do but one day  I--really  a few mo nths before we decided to leave, I 
went there and it was su mmer and Helli  said, let me 
have y our hatand glov es and bag. And she had a 
dress on; they  allowed her to when she went out. Sh
e was outside the perimeter of the place where she 
lived. They  allowed her togo into the park. They  had 
a park and inthe park there were al way s two nurses 
who walked together andwatched pe
ople who were on the outside. You 
couldn't walk aw ay because ther e 
was a gate. At the gate,y ou had to have a pass to ge
t into theparkand get out.Helli said all of a sudden, 
don't I look nice. She looked beautiful.Had a hat on,gloves on, and my  bag and she took my arm and 
said let's go out now. As we approached that gate
, and the gate, two nurses were walking around right 
there. She scr ea med and then she was ve ry bad for awhile, for a few we eks. But she wanted to get out. 
Interview er: 
She never paid any  attention to politics,did she? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Unfortunately , we all didn't. We should have 
but we didn't have televisiony et. We didn't 
read the newspapers. Young people were not interest
ed. Those at the university did. Theuniversity  
students, as a rule, did. 
Interview er: 
Yeah, that's why  I asked, b
ecause she was a la w stu d ent. 
Emmi Lehner: 
She was not. Helli was n o t political, not at all. 
Interview er: 
Was she enga ged at any  time?  

Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, she w as. She was e ngaged whenshe was 16 to a man who loved her very mu ch but 
she had somebody else in mind. This man was a drug a
ddict and was killed on his mo torcy cle. This other 
man alway swanted to visit her but my mo ther didn't 
want it to continue. She liked men very mu ch, very  
fond of boy s.She alway s warned me, y ou know. We 
were very  close and she would alway s say, Emmi, 
never go with any man, never do an
y thing untilyouget married. Very  religious in her way . When she was 
in the hospital, she became very religio
us. But she wa sn't when she  was nor mal.  
Interview er: 
So she became religious inthe hospital? 
Emmi Lehner: 
In the hospital. It was al way s stages, three weeks of  this, three weeks of that. 
Interview er: 
This would be Catholic religious? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes.  
Interview er: 
Even thoughthe hospitalwas not Catholic? 
Emmi Lehner: 
The hospital was not but it was a county hospita
l. Idon't know wh at they  were but they  
had a chapel in there. Youhad to have achapel. Y
ou know, like theAllge meine, t h ere's a chape l in the 
co mpoundbut it doesn't need it. They  asky ou whenyou
--whatever. But they  do  th e same here. You know 
that here all the time, y ouhave to give 
your religion; they  asky ouwhat religion. 
Interview er: 
And hers was given as Catholic? 
Emmi Lehner: 
Catholic, yes. You see w h en my  mo ther re married and he was a Catholic, there was no 
other way .  We were not brought upŠmy father was 
  ﬁconfessionslos,ﬂ he did not want to beany  
denomination,y o u know. Imean, I can reme mber, I w
as little, I was so small when he diedbut--. I was 
glad that I have this Catholic religion, very good religion. 
Interview er: 
Yes.  
Emmi Lehner: 
But that's the story. I thinkyou're right when they  find ou t she is partly Jewish, officially  
they --. I don't know what happened to her officially . O
fficially  in Vienna, that I can't tell y ou.Trudy  was 
away  and hermo ther w as married to a J ew. So sh
e wouldn't goback, it was March. She wouldn't go back 
for any onebecause she did not know what happened.
She was too, she was Evan gelisch. Trudy was not 
Jewish she w as Evangelisc h  because her  step mo ther was Evangeli sch. 

Interview er: 
Yes, she s aid that her father was J ewish,  her 
mo ther was Catholic and they  were brought up  
as Protestants . 

Emmi Lehner: 
As Protestants, y es, I kno w about Trudy  and Otto.That was already  so crazy  in  Europe, 
youknow. On ce here, I'm living--, I don't know ify o u know Miami--. 

Interview er: 
Never been t h ere. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Well, y ouknow ifyouwould be here, there is
--people are religious in this country , far 
mo re than we were, ever, even now. They  are going 
to church on Sunday , I don't but I--peoplearound me, 
all around me  neighbors and all that. They  are going 
to church and th e Jewish people are going  to the 
temp le. You know whenmy  husbandwas here, I g o --w
ent with him once a month to  the temp le. I don't 
know nothing about Jewish religion bu t I mean I--my  hus
band wanted to do this fo r his father.You know, 
very  fond ofhis father. He went every month to 
the temp le. Had a very beautiful temp le here, Second 
Place in Mia mi. My husband alway s went there. There 
were- but here people ar e very  religious, far, far 
mo r e religious than any b ody I knew in Au stria. Aust
ria, you don't go to church mu ch. Because there are 

so many  Mischlinge there, an enormous amount
. You know I understand now
 probably  Trudy will tell 
you th at Vienna is overrunwith fo
reigners. You could have Romania,
 Hungary , Po land. Every thing is 
good in Vienna. It is in one way  go
od because business is very  good. The 
hotels are all sold out. This is 
apparently good. Thedollar is very lowand I'm very  happy  abou t th at. As soonas I get my  pension from 
them. I found my  husbandhad a pension from Vienna
, through his father. I don't know what happened 
now that I am--I don't think the churches are overrun in Vienna. 
Interview er: 
No, no, only by  tourists. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Only by  tourists and they only want to  lo
ok at it because they  are old and they are 
beautiful. Vienna is beautiful, there's nothing to  say about itbut Ihave no feelingtoward it, not to--. 
Interview er: 
And the other cities aren 't bad. Graz. Salzburg-- 
Emmi Lehner: 
Salzburg is beautiful, beautiful. Youknow, the 
firsttime after 25 y ears, after I was a way  
for 25y ears,and I ca me to  Vienna. Myparents stay ed  in Graz because my  mo t h er's mother died there and 
she left the apart ment to them. I was ther e with th
e children and I telly ou I was impressed. I had never 
seen Gra z bef o re. Very  impressed, very  nice. Salzburg is special nic e but it's a tourist town. Graz is not a 

tourist town. 
Interview er: 
No, which is one reason why  I like it. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, have youbeen inGraz?  
Interview er: 
Yes. I've been to --. 
Emmi Lehner: 
How co mey oudidn't go to Vienna? 
Interview er: 
I've been to Vienna. Oh, y eah, I've
 been to Vienna several time s. 
Emmi Lehner: 
Did you see the I mperial  Hotel? 
Interview er: 
I can't s ay  I've been inside, no. 
Emmi Lehner: 
You should have seen it inside because the st
aircase goes up and the pictures there--. 
Interview er: 
I went to theHofburg andthe Schronbrunn and the Belvedere but-- 
Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, very  nice. I lived out there. We lived 
with my grandmother when I was very  small, 
right after my  father was ki lled, we lived there. My
 mother went back home and we lived and every  day I 
was- I loved ani mals, I used to go thereevery  day 
when I was little at my  grandmother's. I loved it, it's 
really  beautiful there. I have to say  the outskirts of
 Vienna and all th at, it's very beautiful. But it is not 
now because of this--y o u know, there's a lot of fo reig
ners walk arou nd there, speak different languages. 
Hard to- can't  stand it. 

Interview er: 
Well, in thatway ,  it's a lot like New York. 
Emmi Lehner: 
But New York is still America. You know, it'
s--I don't know. Ilove New Yo rk my self. I 
lived there six months and I loved itbut I wouldn't li
ke to live there. I prefer to live here. You should 
co me one day to Miami an d I takey o u around. It's beautiful. 

Interview er: 
My brother lived there fora couple ofy
ears. He went to med school in Miami. 

Emmi Lehner: 
Yes, w ell I  thinkit is very nice. It's ve ry bad everywhere, y ou know, because  of the crime 
and all that. Igo to the bighospital where I have--Pete r
 in now. I'm so scared to drive there, I can't tell 
youbecause t h ere are-- wheny ou cross northwest, north
east to northwest, all black and when th ey  are 
going likeyou see on television, oneofour anc
horwoman, with a gentle man, wa s attacked.  
Interview er: 
I didn't knowthat. 
Emmi Lehner: 
They broke the window and they  were cut. They
 were in the mid d le and there were cars 
right, left back  and front. Th ey broke th at window and hit them, hit her in the ey e. She was very lucky  

that she save d  her ey e butthey took thepurse. You 
see, people leave their purse on the other side. My  car 
doesn't have air-conditioning, I have to have it prepared. I have tohave windows open, very  little but it is 

so hot here in Miami; y esterday 96, I thought th at 
I would die. Th e weather has changed greatly. We had 
so mu ch rain before but apparently the pollution and all 
that is affecting the air right now. It isreally  hot 
here, not theway  to come here. Trudy was only here two day s, unfortunately . Ican't wait until she co mes 
back. 
Interview er:
