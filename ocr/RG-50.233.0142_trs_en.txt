Interview with David Yegher 
August 18, 1992 
Maryland 
 
     

Q: My name  is David Yegher.  It™s spel
led right now Yegher but it used to be J. 
Jegher.  My name  before  the war at 
home , I was called Chaim David and I was 
born in a town called Ronadejus in Transy
lvania in the Carpathian Mountains in 
Romania.  
 

A: What was the year of your birth?   

 

Q: September 17, 1927.  I was living at home
 with my mother and father and we 
were a family of six children, three gi
rls and three boys.  My two older sisters 
were ma rried.  One was living in a city
 called Siget and she had two children.  
She married a man by the name of Ignatz
 Hershkowitz.  My 
second older sister 
was married and I don™t reme mber his 
name.  I know Ashma el but I don™t 

reme mber the fa mily name .  Anywa y th
e whole problem star
ted with all the 
suffering we endured.  I was thirteen years 
old when we couldn™t go from town to 
town and we had to register and we ha
d to close the front windows to the house 
facing the street.  Jews couldn™t travel 
on trains.  It was l
ong- suffering and one 
day the military came in.  It was a Friday afternoon.  My mother was cooking the 

Shabbos dinner. 
 

Q: This was in 1940 about? 

 

A: In 1944 and my mother was cooking the 
Shabbos dinner and of course we were 
all at home because we were not allo
wed to go anyplace and they told us 
whatever we can carry to ma ke a pa
ckage.  We  have to go with them. 
 

Q: We re these iron guards who came  or we
re these gendarmes or the military?  Do 
you recall? 
 

A: I really don™t reme mber.  
I just don™t reme mber.  All I 
know is that when we were 
leaving, whatever, we ma de a package 
that everybody could carry, whatever you 
could carry.  My mother was crying and tel
ling my fa ther, this is what we worked 

all our lives.  This is what  we worked and tried to make a fa mi ly life and try to 

ma ke, you know, to eventually be able to achieve some thing and now we have 

everything.  What we have now
 is just what we can carry in our bags.  We  had a 
very prosperous farm, or chard with trees. 
 We  had cattle, but my father was also 
what I would call it ---
----- transpor tation or  something.  Wh at it was. There was 
no cars, it was primitive, there was no cars, no machineries but when anybody 

  
 
2
wanted to go into the city my father 
drove two horses with a wagon that people 
got on the wa gon to go to the city. 
 
Q: What city would you go to? 

 

A: To Siget.  And anybody wanted to come  back, they also got on the wagon and 
they came back and he was passing a fe w towns on the way until we got where 

we were living.  Also on the way to Siget 
in the morning there was country stores 
all in these villages
, towns that my father stopped a
nd got a list from the country 
stores whatever it needed and he went in
to Si get, bought it, brought it to them so 
they would have the things they
 were looking for, they need. 
 

Q: So he ma de regular trips? 

 

A: Every day except Shabbos. 

 

Q: These people would pay him for the ride into Siget? 

 

A: Yeah.  So in other words there were 
ma ny things that pertained to conduct a way 
of ma king a living.  For instance, one way is
 to have transportation for people to 
bring them i nto the city and also back. 
 And also on the way into the city, the 
far mers who had cows or sheep that mil
k, they had it in containers and we took 
the containers from the m and we took it into the ma in creamery in the city and 

they ma de cream, whipped cream, butter and then we brought the empty 

containers back and we droppe
d them off.  We  did this six days a week.  One way 
of ma king a living was taking 
in the milk which was also from our far m and from 
the other farmers and picking up th
e list from the country store– 
 

Q: Of their needs. 

 

A: Of their needs, and a country store 
was not just anything 
like you have a store 
here.  I mean a country store over th
ere, we bought petroleum, we bought 
whiskey, we bought flour, we bought whatever
 in the world it was.  A general 
store everything that the far mers or the 
people in the villages 
needed.  And that 
was usually the only store and therefore ther
e were no separate stores for this or 
separate stores for that.  So this is what we did. 
 

Q: This was two horses.  It must
 have been a pretty large wagon? 
 

A: Yeah, it was.  You could s
eat at  least twenty people. 
 

Q: How long was the journey from your town to Siget? 

 

A: About an hour and a half, two hours.  Al
so it was big because 
of the hills and the 
mountains which you have to go through.  Th
ere was very steep hill that it was 
very difficult to get up in the winter time or even when you had on the way from 

  
 
3
the city that you were bringing back to th
e people flour and petroleum.  This was 
very heavy.  When you loaded up the wagon 
it weighed like a railroad car and to 
pull up the steep hills, to cr
oss over into the villages, it was very, very difficult. 
 

Q: I suppose you had to help pull or push the wagon, or did the horses ma nage? 

 

A: The horses pushed and you put your el
bow and you pushed along with them and a 
lot of times depending on the weather 
you just didn™t have enough power to pull 
it.  So we went to the nearby farm and 
they came in and lend us another horse or 
two that we put up to help pull over the m
ountain.  Just as hard as it was going to 
get up on the mountain, it was just  as diffi
cult getting down, to hold back all that 
weight.  And you got to the point wher
e you were about holding it to the mi ddle 
of the mount ain going down and then you just lost control and it would just shoot 

down and anything happen.  It was God™s will.  So me times the horses were  tryi ng 

to hold it back.  They held it back as much 
as they could and then they just used to 
just like slide down on the hind legs on 
the ground and the weight from the wagon 

was just pulling them down and sometime one horse was holding back so hard 

that they pulled the whole wagon into the 
ditch on the side where the water was 
running.  Then we had a hard time .  We 
had to unload it, put everything on the 
street and get the wagon out and load it up 
again.  It was a very hard life but it 
was home .  I mean we had a very, very 
strong family unity.  And we always -- 
sometimes it was very little to eat and so
metimes whatever it was we sat at  a tabl e 
and we shared.  And my  mother, ma y sh
e rest in peace, she always fed everybody 
and some times there wasn™t anything left
 and she just went without. And I saw 
that myself. 
 
Q: Where were you in the range of ch
ildren?   We re you one of the youngest? 
 
A: No, I was the fourth one.  Then, of c
ourse, I had relatives.
  I had, of course, 
grandparents.  My mother™s side lived in
 the same town where we lived.  And, of 
course, my father™s parents lived with
 us.  My grandfather, both of my 
grandfathers had died. 
 

Q: While you were a kid they died
 or even before you were born? 
 

A: They died before the problem started. 
 But my grandmother, my father™s mother, 
she was in bed all the time, she was some thing wrong with her, and of course we 

carried her to the train when we were 
leaving.  And we took her and she was in 
the wagon even when we went to Auschwitz.  And of course my other 

grandmother was still walking.  Then my fa
ther had one brother and three sisters. 
 

Q: All living in Ronadejus? 

 

A: Two of the m were living in Ronadejus.
  The others were living in some  other 
towns.  My mother had a brother and tw
o sisters.  Her brother luckily enough 
before all this trouble started, he emi grate
d to Argentina and his children, I mean 

  
 
4
my uncle, I happened to see him after th
e war.  He  moved from Argentina to 
Israel and he died just about a couple 
of years ago now.  But his children, my 
cousins, are still living now.  But my  mo
ther™s two sisters, the husbands and the 
children, they all perished in Auschwitz  
 My father was, they were very poor 
when they got ma rried.  They didn™t have
 anything.  He started all of this so-
called enterprises, whatever, a way that was needed and in order to be able to 

support the family and the money that he ma
de fr om this -- taking all these things 
to the villages and into the town and 
everything else, we bought land.  We had 
beautiful orchards with apples, pears,
 plums.  We  ended up ma king our own 
whiskey because I reme mber big, big drums like they have gas storage tanks that 

they used to put in all the fr uit.  And 
there was a little thing comi ng out from the 

bottom after whatever long 
it took, and the whiskey was comi ng out and we ma de 
our own wine and we also ma de our own dr
ied fr uit.  And we sold it not only to 
the markets in Romania at the time but
 we also sold it to the neighboring 

countries like  Czechoslovakia and Hungary and this and that. 
 

Q: How did you ma nage to sell to other 
countries?   Was there a co-op set up? 

 

A: I have no idea. 

 

Q: So you must have produced a ma ss of
 dried fruit, a fairly large amount?  
 

A: Yes, yes.  I reme mber when I was a little boy that in the summe rti me, whatever 
ma nure from the cows was piled up in big 
piles.  And in the 
wintertime when the 
snow was you chopped it up in chunks and you 
loaded it in a sled and you hauled 
it into the fields for fertilizer .  During 
the daytime my father was taking care of 
whatever he had to do the business of, 
I don™t know what would you call that, 
transportation or whatever.  And at 
nighttime  we worked in the fields. 
 

Q: Is that right? 

 

A: You™d better believe it.  I mean that 
was the kind of situ
ation.  There was no 
clock, there was no nothing.  You devoted your
 whole time working in the fields.  

And then, of course, when the summe r  came, you have to plow it and you plowed 

it with the horses not with tractors.  Ev
ery time  you cleared 
more trees to make 
more land, clearing for farm land to be ab
le to.  One time my 
oldest brother was 
already taken from us into what they
 called forced labor by the Hungarians 
because during my time when I was going 
in school which remi nds me another 
situation.  When I was going in school and I was four years in public school. 
 

Q: This was Roma nian public school? 

 

A: Roma nian public schools.  I had very little time to do my home work because 
when I came  home  I had to do the chores in the fields. 
 

Q: Did you have specific duties? 

  
 
5
 
A: Yes I had to clean all the stables and s
ee that the milking cows were fed.  And my 
sister did my home work.  As a ma tter of
 fact, when we started school, I flunked 
the first year because I never did my home
work.  But my sister that  was a year 
younger from me , she started school the follo
wing year and she did her home work 
and she did my home work.  Bu
t I was bright enough that 
I really did very well not 
from studying at home, just for being in
 school and doing it when the teacher was 
doing the stuff.  Then the problem came wh
en the Hungarian took over that part.  
I started the fifth year in school with
 a Hungarian teacher that only spoke 
Hungarian.  I never spoke 
Hungarian in my life. 
 

Q: It™s a foreign la
nguage to ma ny people. 
 

A: Yes and what happened was, I was very good 
in arithmetic.  We used to have tests 
like who could answer faster like five tim
es five, five times three, eight times 
nine.  I always was the winner.  But we
 had the test in Hungarian and I lost 

because I had to transfer th
e Hungarian to Roma nian or to Yiddish.  Even today 
when I am figuring a bill, when I had my
 catering, people used to always be 
amazed because I figured in Yiddish, always. 
 

Q: Is that what you s
poke at home , Yiddish? 
 

A: Only Yiddish.  We  spoke 
Yiddish at home  and I spoke 
Roma nian in school.  And 
then in the fifth year I had to learn Hunga
rian.  And it was a very hard thing.  And 
one of the things that really hurt me  --Œ
 when we were leaving the house, when 
they were taking us to --- they took us 
to the ghetto, there was one of the guys 
who was my  best friend all my life. 
 

Q: A Jewish guy? 

 

A: No, a gentile.  His father was the post
 office ma n.  He delivered the ma il.  We  
were very close friends.  
We were practically every day together.  When I was 
leaving, when we were taken, I had on a red sweater with no sleeves.  It wa s ma n-

ma de.  The guy that was taking us told me
 to take my s weater off.  Would you 
believe it I saw him take my sweat
er, he took it with a stick --- 
 

Q: Didn™t want to touch it. 

 

A: And he gave it to my best friend because my best friend asked him to get it for 
him.  And he was wearing a rifle but it wa
s not a real one.  It was ma de out of 
wood just so that he had the authority. 
 This is some thing that I could never 
believe.  I never went back there and if
 I ever do I™m gonna take a sweater off 
him.  If it™s the last thing in my life I™m gonna do. 
 

Q: Were there ma ny Jews i n that commun
ity?   What was the breakdown in terms of 
gentiles and Jews in your town? 

  
 
6
 
A: There was about, for that time of the worl
d it was considered to be a lot.  It was 
two hundred fa milies.  And there was about half of them, Je ws.  There was only 

one ma in street that the whole town cons
isted of, but there was a lot of home s in 

the back fields and in the woods.  Most 
of the home s, I woul d say seventy-five 

percent that were built on the ma in road
 were Jewish people.  The Jewish people 
had more or less -- it was even in those 
days like we had a ki
tchen that we were, 
you know the floor was nothing but a mud fl
oor because I reme mber my mother 
once a week used to bring m
ud and ma ke it soft with water and just take the hand 
and go over and give it a fres
h go-over.  But still in al
l it had a table and chairs 
and we were eating with knives and fork
s and we had kosher dairy dishes and 
meat dishes.  My father was very
 religious.  My mother was --- 
 

Q: Chassid or ---? 

 

A: Well, I never knew the word Chassi
d at the time but I do know I never saw 
anybody anywhere in America or anywhere 
I have been that could have been 
more religious than my father.  My mo
ther wore what they call a sheitl and I 
r e me mb e r  w h e n  my  s i s t e r s  g o t  ma r r i ed  t h e y
 cut their hair.  An
d they cried.  I 
reme mber that.  We lived, for instance, a lot of the gentiles that were living in that  

area, they had a house.  But 
their house consiste
d of four wa lls and in the corner 
was a bed and in the other corner was a 
stove which was heated with wood.  In 
the wintertime they kept this wood going, th
e stove.  This is how they heated and 
they all slept in one bed and all around, 
whatever.  But we had beds.  We  were 
civilized people.  We  ha d beds.  Ever
ybody had their own bed.  We  mi ght had a 
room where we had three kids sleeping 
in the same room, wha t ever, but we had 
beds and we each had a bed. 
 

Q: Was this one floor this house, one story? 

 

A: Yeah, one floor.  In the summertime westill continued, for instance, we had our 
own, like they call here a pizza oven, we ha
d one that was built out of brick.  And 
we heated it with wood, ma de it hot, a
nd the oven got hot and my mother baked 
bread and also she put Fr iday in the chol
ent for Shabbos and she put it in the oven 
with the coal created by the wood and 
you can imagine if a woma n today would 
have to go out and get wood and create the oven, this baker oven, which was like 

a huge boiler which was built out of stone
 and brick.  You bring the wood and you 

put it in and you light the fi
re and you create coal 
and when it™s hot enough you 
put in all the pots and have like a 24 
by 36 opening and you sealed it and you used 
wet mud to seal it so the heat will not es
cape,  and then  you opened that Saturday 
after you come  home from shul and that™s
 what we  ate Saturday, the cholent and 
the kugel and all that and it was always 
very delicious.  There™s nothing ever  
comparising to that . 
 

Q: Was this oven outside the house? 

 

  
 
7
A: No, it was a corner of the house.  Like let™s say when you come  in from the front, 
the fr ont part  like three-quarters was the kitchen and then there was a wall with a 
door that you went into the other room, th
at was the other corner of the house.  
That corner  was built where the baker-ove
n was built.  It had a big chimney going 

up and this is how my mother baked the br
ead and put the food in for the cholent 
and things like that.  And we had a w
ooden stove in the kitchen which was lined 
with brick.  This was how we cooked and th
is is how we heated the winter.  When 
you went to sleep and I™m telling you it wa
s bitter cold, none of the rooms were 
ever heated, wherever you went to sl
eep but you ne ver had to worry because you 
had feather quilts.  You was really in no problem. 
 

Q: Did you attend cheder? 

 

A: Oh yes, I attended it™s not a cheder. I mean I didn™t have to be in public school 
until ni ne o™clock so I started cheder in the morning like 6:30.  Then when I 

finished cheder my mother waited for me
 to give me  some thi ng to eat and I was 
eating while I walked to public school.  A
nd when I got out of public school again 
she waited for me to give me something to 
eat and then I went  to cheder till nine  
o™clock at night. 
 

Q: So morning and night you went? 

 

A: Yeah and I also of course had a lot 
of Shabbos.  You know they had teachers and 
lectures and things like th
at.  And I spent a whole day in cheder, Sunday, because 
there was no public school. 
 
Q: And your chores on top of all of that. 
 

A: Chores on top of that.  And of c
ourse, then they took us to the ghetto. 

 

Q: This was the Ordea ghetto, the Siget ghetto or Ordea? 

 

A: Well, it was across the river.  It was 
in Czechoslovakia.  It™s called Sl otyna, 
Solopvina in Yiddish.  That™s where they got all the Jews from the whole area 

because when the Hungarian came  in, they already had occupied Czechoslovakia, 

it was Hungary.  Then when they came  
in, took over the Carpathian Mountain it 
became Hungary, too.  So all of it was already one and when they got the Jews 

fr om all the towns and fr om the big cit
y, from Siget they formed the ghetto in 
what used to be Czechoslovakia.  It used to be Slotyna and in Yiddish they used 

to refer to as Solopvina.  They cramped us
 in.  They took a sec
tion of the town, of 
the thing, and they ma de a ghetto.  They 
moved a ll the gentiles out and they took 
whatever it was and they cramped us in, te
n in a room.  Ther e was no such a thing 
as a bed or anything. 
 

Q: When in 1944 were you taken from your home?  

 

  
 
8
A: I am for one terribly --- 
 

Q: Okay I can verify that because we ha ve
 start times for the ghettos and end times 
for the ghettos. 
 

A: One thing I just don™t reme mber dates.  
I just know what happened.  So when we 
were in the ghetto in Solopvina we had tremendous suffering because aside from 

everything, sleeping on the floor
 and things like that, we
 just didn™t have food.  
We were really suffering.  And so I e
ndangered my life by sneaking out from the 
ghetto.  The way I did it, there was some body goi ng through because you see you 

have to go through guards and they check
ed everything. The traffic still people 
were going on the ma in road.  We  were not
 allowed to get near the main road. 
 

Q: Was there a fence around the ghetto?  

 

A: Yeah, oh sure, there was a fence ar
ound the ghetto and there was guards around 
the ghetto and also where the ma in road wa
s that went through the ghetto that was 

also blocked off.  If you had a house you ha
d to block the windows, board it off.  

And there was a fence that had to be ma de higher so nobody could get over it.  

But I went over it and I saw a wagon with
 two horses.  There were just wagons 
and horses that the local people were stil
l using. So what happened there is a long 
piece of wood that holds together the front 
wheels with the back wheels, that™s in 
the bottom like.  And I put my legs onto that under the wagon and my ha nds and I 

went through the checkpoint and when I got 
on the other side I went into the town 
where we were living.  I guess 
whatever it was at that 
day I told them that we 
were being held in such and such a pl
ace and that we don™t have food and we™re 
starving and this and that.  I was able 
to manage to get a wagon from some body 
and I had a lot of people -- because y
ou see my father was very honored and 
respected because of all the tr
ansactions and all the things
 that we did for the town 
and for all the other towns so everyb
ody knew because if you wanted to send 
some thing to the city you got my father
 to carry it.  If you wanted to bring 
some thing home , you got my father to carry 
it.  So we were very well known.  So 
when I came  into the town and told th
em we™re starving and I had a wagon, I had 
from the farmers, they brought me  all kinds of things and I loaded up a whole 

wagon.  
 

Q: You were able to get back to your old town? 

 

A: I got back to my old town but when 
I got into town I kept asking where the 
Gestapo was to ma ke sure I don™t run into
 them.  And some of the people even 
helped me  stay out so they couldn™t reach me .  And I loaded one of these big 

wagons and I mean full with everything, with corn and potatoes and mostly that.  

I found two horses that used to belong to 
us.  Of course I recognized them and I 
got them and I hitched them up and woul
d you believe it I drove in through the 
checkpoint and I was inside already and wh
en I did, I wanted to get in.  You know 
everything was 
blocked off. 

  
 
9
 
Q: The ghetto itself was blocked off? 

 

A: The ghetto, the ma in road, everything was fe
nces.  In order for me  to be able to do 
this, I broke open whatever I was able to 
do, a gate.  And I got in the ghetto and I 
drove to where my mother and father 
were and what happened was my mother 
was so worried and so nervous and upset sh
e used to bite the back of her hand to 
keep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset.  And when I got ther e I 

yelled quickly whoever was available to
 unload quickly the wagon.  And when I 
did that after it was unloaded I took the 
two horses and the wagon back to the 
ma in road and I slapped them in the back and I let them go.  And nobody ever 

found out. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther know you were going to do that? 

 

A: Are you kidding?   She would tie me  up. 

 

Q: But she knew you were mi ssing and she was --? 

 

A: Of course, because I was gone for two 
days.  As far as she was concerne d she 
didn™t know if I am alive or if I am dead 
because when I had to do this I ha d to do 
it on the QT because I had to find out if I 
go another half a mile in the town am I 
running in.  They were looking for people li
ke me that if you did some thing what 
they didn™t let you do they just hanged you 
and just let you hang in order to set an 
example. 
 
Q: Your whole fa mily was in the 
ghetto except your oldest brother? 
 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: He had been deportedfor forced labor earlier? 

 

A: That™s right.  He was in the Russian
 front line behind the enemy line digging 
trenches and doing this kind of work and this
 is the only brother that survived.  He 
is now in Israel.  I know of another man 
who lives in Cleveland who was together 

with my brother in the same labor force. 
 So we were in this ghetto and we were 
there until they brought more and more pe
ople, more Jews, till they rounded up all 
the Jews from all over the area. 
 

Q: Did this take a couple of m
onths or weeks, do you recall? 

 

A: I would say ma ybe a couple of months.  
I really don™t reme mber dates because to 
me  one day was just like another da y.  I 
never knew --- as a matter of fact I didn™t 
even know the day that I was born because before I came to America there was a 

lady in Germany who s a ys to me  I was young, under age, and some body says to 

me  one day, would you like to go to Am
erica and I said what are you talking 

  
 
10
about.  Anyway I said we ll they asked me
 the date I was born.  But every time 
some body a sked me  I just used whatever da
ta just came to my mi nd.  The latest 
was very easy.  I used to say January firs
t.  So this lady as
ked me where I was 
born and this lady asked me  for my name
 and I never could believe she happened 
to write a letter to her or
ganization UNRRA and one day sh
e sees me  in the street 
and she comes running after me  and she says, look what I™ve got, look what I™ve 
got.  I™ve got your birth certificate.  They 
send it to her.  And so that™s what I 
knew the day I was born and things like 
that.  But you see my brother, I am 
Yegher and he is Taub.  The reason for th
at is because when the Jewish people 
got ma rried, nobody ever realized that you have
 to go to City Ha
ll to get a license 
so when my older sisters and my olde r 
brother was born they were name d after 
my mother because the laws didn™t consid
er them married because they weren™t 
ma rried legal.  But then when they found 
out they had to have from the city a 
marriage certificate, then when I was 
born I became Yegher.  So everybody  
wants to know why your brother Ta ub and why I am Yegher. 
 

Q: Yegher is your father™s name ?  

 

A: Yes.  Yegher is my father™s name  a
nd my mother™s name  was  Taub.  That™s why 
they are name d Taub.  We™re in the ghe
tto and every day you know how you must 
feel.  You had a beautiful whatever it 
was nice life, nice home, nice situation, 
huma n beings live whatever it was and 
all of a sudden you are cramped in like I 
don™t have to explain.  You put twenty peopl
e in a room.  You could just sit on the 
floor, or whatever it is. 
 

Q: Were you in an apartme nt or was this a house? 
 
A: There were houses like they have to
wnhouses here, one floor you know.  When 
they brought the people in from the other 
towns they just unloaded whatever --- 
we walked from the stations.  And when we walked they decided you go here and 

you go here and you go here.  You split up the 
families and when it™s full they say 

go to the next house and you keep pushing in and pushing in until it™s full. Once 

it™s full they go to the next house and this is how they packed them in. 
 

Q: You all ma naged to stay together though. 

 

A: Well, once you get food in a house nobody stayed guard because you could walk 
around outside the ghetto.  So if three pe
ople from one fa mily was in one house 
and three people from the other they just so
rt of stayed together.  Until one day -- 
you know the life, one of the things that 
kept people from losing their mi nd like 
my father, for instance, you pray every 
morning and you put tfillin and you daven 
every night and you worry about the Sh
abbos and you keep things sort of 
some thing to do so you don™t go out of 
your mi nd and this is what usually 

happened the whole time. 
 

Q: They didn™t assign labor
 or anything like that? 

  
 
11
 
A: No, we were just kept in.  You could go out certain times even from the houses 
but you have to stay inside and so on.  
So one day after being in the ghetto and I 
don™t have to tell you we had people getti
ng all kinds of bacteria and sickness and 
dying and everything else.  Even the worl
d at that time didn™t have the proper 
me dication what they have today.  Even
 today you put twenty people, fifteen 
people in a room and you™re bound to have problems.  And so until one day after 

being all this time in the ghetto and all 
this tremendous --- And the situation was 
they never left you alone.  The entire tim
e from the mi nute this thing started they 
were always trying to find a way how 
to beat you and how to keep you running 
and how to keep you scared and how to keep you from having no time to thing or 

trying ma ybe ma ke a plan of some  kind. 
And they were constantly taking people 
from one house move them to the other house.
  For no reason at all they just came  
in beating people.  And people were so 
scared and people were
 always crying and 
people were always upset in situations like 
that.  They created su
ch a fear that we 
never knew what™s going on in the worl
d outside.  We  never knew what the 
situation is all about.  We were just  like
 sheep.  Li ke animals we were herded into 
one corner, herded into another corner, beat
en into here, beaten into there, moved 
into here, moved into there.  When th
e time came they evacua ted us from the 

ghetto, I reme mber distinctly they told us 
that the front is lying where they were 
fi ghting the Russian was getting in da nger 
because they were afraid that  we will 
provide information, we will turn espi onage 
or traitors or  partisans against them 
to help the Russians.  But we never ha
d a chance from nothing.  We never had a 
chance.  We  didn™t know a war, we didn™
t know nothing.  We  just didn™t know 

from nothing.  So they told us that the tim
e has come  that we™re close to the front 
line and they have to evacuate us 
deeper into, away from the front. 
 

Q: Had you heard any bombing? 

 

A: No, absolutely not.  So what happene
d is, you know the Jewish people, they 
always are so law abiding citizens.  They
 are such a law abiding citizens. I don™t 
know if this has anything to do with 
this or not but while I was here in 

Washington, I worked in a place, in a rest
aurant  called Duke Zieberts and on the 
way to work one day I hear on my radio 
that George Lincoln 
Rockwell is going to 
be speaking on the ma ll.  And so I went in
to work and when I finished my work I 
walked down to see what™s happened.  I 
just couldn™t believe I saw swastikas in 
America.  I saw a ma n like they used to be a Gestapo tall off the ground, the 

guards.  I saw a ma n that looked like that 
and he™s talking and he has a swastika.  
There™s people with swastikas all around 
and I said to myself, I am not going to 
be like the Jews in Europe. They had the 
tallis and tfillin and when the Gestapo 
came they said, Sh™ma Yisrael.  I™m not 
going to be like that.  I™m going to go 

down and I™m going see what he says.  And 
he was talking about whatever he was 
saying.  So I walked away and I started talk
ing to the Jewish people in this area.  
As a ma tter of fact I tried to contact 
B™nai Brith, the Anti-Defamation League.  
And they told me , no problem, because this
 is America.  That™s what they call 
freedom of s peech.  But I just couldn™t be
lieve this is freedom of speech.  So I 

  
 
12
tried to talk to -- I met in libraries 
in the Silver Spring area was Jewish Wa r 
Veterans.  And I™m never going to forg
et there wa s one guy, Harvey Rosenberg, 
who was a Jewish lawyer  who told me  this
 is freedom of speech, this is America, 
that the swastikas is the American way of
 life.  He was talking about having this 
big rally the fourth of Ju
ly, you know how ma ny people are down there.  So he 
went down there July the third which was 
a Saturday and July the fourth was a 
Sunday.  I went down there and the park 
police had him roped off with ropes.  
He™s speaking on a loud speaker and he ha
s his troopers with the Gestapo folded 
the hands in each corner all the way around 
him and I said to myself, let me hear 
what he™s got to say.  If Harvey Rosenber
g, a Jewish lawyer, I tried to tell him, 
what are you going to do?   Are you going to
 wait until he come s to your house.  
You can all let this ma n, this is not what it
 is.  And he says to me , if he come s to 
my house, I™m going to kill hi m.  And I says, well, I™m glad to hear you at least 

say you are not going to say Sh™ma Yisrael
.  So I went down there and I honest 
and truly tell you for the first time  in my 
life I was able to beat up a Nazi.  I tore 
his ear off and he tried to take my eyes out. 
 

Q: This was Rockwell? 

 

A: No, one of his troopers.  And the ma n I ta
lked to, I™m the one that started the riot.  
I had my ha nd on the rope.  And I was trying to reason with him.  He was a 

marine that turned Nazi.  So I said to
 him, why are you people doing this sort of 

thing.  Didn™t the world suffer enough for wh
at Hitler did?  And he says to me  
who are you to talk like that.  I says to
 him you s ee this number, I got this in 
Auschwitz.  And he says to me , you big li
ar.  How much did you pay to have this 
put on?   And he said to me  we are goi
ng to build bigger and 
better gas chambers 
than Hitler did.  When he  told that to 
me I put my hand on the rope and I jumped 
in.  And I started a riot .  And when I star
ted the riot I got arrest ed because for the 
first time  in my life when I jumped in 
the guy got on top of me  and put his fingers 
in my eyes and whatever I had to do.  But I got him me ssed up in such a way that 

the police took me  off and they
 twisted my hand in back 
of me and they held me  
by my belt and by my hand in the back.  A
nd I says to the officer, officer I have 
nothing against you but you™re breaking my 
ar m.  And I says, if you don™t let me 
loose or you ma ke me  in pain, I says, I 
don™t want to fight you.  And he says to 
me , shut up, you did enough dama ge alrea
dy.  So I was booked.  I put ten dollars 
down as they call whatever it was, I don™
t know, and they let me  go home .  It was 
in the newspapers and the Nazi party cal
led my house; they™re going to kill me , 
kill my wife , kill my children.  I had fr iends come over while I went to work to 

stay in the house with my kids. 
 

Q: What year was this? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber what year it was 
but it was all over the newspapers and 
everything else.  And all of a sudden th
e whole town, the Wa shington area was 
talking about David Yegher.  And I had th
e best  cr iminal lawyers who tried to 
donate their time to defend me  against this. 
 So anyway when I went to court the 

  
 
13
judge took one look at me  and he says to
 me , Mr. David Yegher, I feel you had 
enough of the Nazis and you suffered enough of
 your life.  Wh at I™d like to do is 
give you back your ten dollars.  Go downs
tairs and we™ll give you back your ten 
dollars and we™ll make believe like th
is thing never happened.  But anyway 
because of this, all these lawyers were tryi ng to build a case by saying when you 

tell a Holocaust survivor that you™re
 going to build bigger and better gas 

chambers that™s not freedom of spee ch.  Th
at is not some thing that a ma n or that.  
His permit was canceled and he could not talk Fourth of July.  But he was gotten 

more permits for other pl aces; and he  went to Cleveland and he went to this.  But 

I was told by the Anti-Defamation League
, we don™t want you in jail.  You got 
away with it once.  But we don™t want 
you to get involved again because the next 
time you™re not going to get off so easy.  I 
still kept in touch and believe me I had 
people come  to my hous e and wanted me  to
 give them the okay to kill them.  And 
I said, no I don™t want them killed.  I don™
t want to be a ma rtyr.  And besides I 
will not do anything but I would break the la
ws of the United States and as far as 
I™m concerned, I will have no part of it. 
 And I told him if 
you™re going to, I™m 
going to report you because the United States laws has to be uphold.  So anyway 

that™s one of the situations
 that happened to me  in Wa shington.  So when they 
took us from the ghetto they loaded us in closed railroad cars. 
 

Q: You mean the cattle cars? 

 

A: Cattle cars --  and agai n as many as they
 could push in, they pushed in and they 
locked the doors. 
 

Q: What time of year was that, do you recall? 
 
A: It was around this time  of year, around 
Pesach time, around this time of the year. I 
reme mber that much and we rode in thes
e cattle cars for a long time.  We didn™t 

have no food and we didn™t have nothing 
and people go to the bathroom and God 
knows what else.  And then they open the 
cattle cars and ther
e were people with 
sticks.  The mi nute they open the cars 
and you had to get off the cars, it wa s 
between tracks, like for no reason they were
 yelling, los, los, and beatings, for no 
reason.  Everybody didn™t have a chan
ce to look or see or do anything.  
Everybody didn™t have a chance to look or
 see or do anything.  Everybody was 
just trying to bend down to prevent them
 from hitting you and they were beating 
you all the time.  We wer e  going down 
in between these tracks and I saw 
some body i n the front with a long stick like 
and he was saying this way, this way, 

to the left  and to the right. 
 

Q: This is Auschwitz now? 

 

A: Yes, I found that out.  When we got there, I™m the only one that was going to the 
right.  My sisters were young, good healt
hy wome n, grew up on the farm, worked 
the fields, but because  they had their childr
en, they went to the left -- my mother, 
my younger brother.  I went to the right w
ith the ma n and I knew that the sister 

  
 
14
who was a year younger than me  also went to
 the right but I talk
ed to people after 
the war that she ended up in the cremator
ium after all.  But I was the only one.  
Now I™ m talking to you what I told you 
a whole generation of uncles and aunts 
and fa milies and people and the whole to
wn that I don™t know if a dozen people 
survived from the whole town.  And I la
nded in Auschwitz, Birkenau.  But then 
while I was there it di dn™t take long for me
 to find out because the next  morning I 
was asking what happened to the pe
ople and some body was showing me  the 
smoke. 
 

Q: Another prisoner you asked? 

 

A: Yeah, that wa s there before me .  So when I found out about what in the world was 
happening with this and that, what can I do
?  When I got there they shaved off my 
hair and they gave me  a striped suit and they gave me  a pair of shoes with wood 

soles and cloth and that was it.  And I wa
s living, I saw in the Holocaust Museum 
the bed, flat, which was eight or ten people 
in three layers.  And when one turned, 

everybody had to turn.  So I was in one of
 those.  And one day I got separated 
from all the people that was from my ar
ea because some body told me  one day that 
this is where the people get numbers a
nd they are being shipped out to work 

instead of sending them to the gas chambers.  I saw a line one day: I was wa y 

across in another barrack and I took my ch
ance and I ran and I 
got in line.  And 
sure enough I got a number and I was put in 
trucks and we were taken to a desert 
place which was in Poland called Obershla
zingen and I landed up in a place called 
Gleiwitz.  I since found out th
at Gleiwitz had four camps, concentration camps.  It 
was Gleiwitz one, Gleiwitz 
two, Gleiwitz three and Gl
eiwitz four.  I was in 
Gleiwitz two.  And whe n we got th
ere, there was not
hing but mountains, 
wilderness.  But the barracks were alr
eady built and it had electric wires around 
and with the Gestapo.  And when we opened the gate, one gate it had where the 

Gestapo came  into in and out bringing out 
the people and one gate is to the side 
where you went to work.  And then they 
also divided the camp though they didn™t 
put electric wires was just a fence with 
two gates and they ma de wome n.  Because 
afterwards, like after we got there, 
we dug down the mountain and we pushed it 
like coal cars and we built a factory.  
They brought the machineries, I™m never 
going to forget this, we built the whole 
thing.  What we did is we mi xed the 
cement by hand, seven shovels of sand, one shovel of cement. Then you kick it 

back and forth, then you ma ke a hole in 
the mi ddle, then you put so much water 
and you mi x it.  But this was like eight stories high.  We  brought the cement eight 

stories with a wheel barrel.  I still have 
here, you see this, you were not allowed to 
stop and I wa s exhausted.  I got to the 
fourth floor, I put the thing down for a 
second, he hit me  with a piece of steel and cracked my skin.  And so we were over 

there and the women came in to mo nitor 
-- it was long tubes, 
steel, it had little 
fires and it was turning and it was creati
ng some  kind of black sword (? ) and the 
wome n wer e  taking care of that.  They 
were taught how to put the sword and 
when it fills up, tie it up and 
put a new one in.  There was a whole shift and we 
were continue building more
 factory, more thing.  And 
I lost my left ear, my 
ma stoid because I was young, energe tic, and after we came  back from work, from 

  
 
15
working in the construction, building a
ll day long, the Gestapo, they had the 
barracks outside they wanted to have b
eautiful flower gard
ens and polish their 
shoes and things like that.  And I was afarm boy, I knew how to work with dirt 

and ma ke these things and I ma de a fl
ower gardens and I did keeping up with 

their fields, whatever it is in front of th
e houses and I cleaned the floors and I used 

to get extra soup for that. 
 

Q: You did this in addition to the factory? 

 

A: In addition, of course, because when 
you were working in the factory, they did 
not give you enough food for you to be able
 to continue working and continue 
living.  They have it calculated to give
 you just enough food to
 keep you alive but 
to extract from you all the strength so youbecome  weak.  And believe me  the way 

they did it there was the 
barracks all the way around 
the fences, there was one 
barrack in the mi ddle.  They called the pe
ople out and you have to get in five in a 
row.  And then they ma ke you run around th
is barrack, the cent
er barrack.  When 
you ran around and then when you got weak
 and they started hitting you, you had 
to run faster, faster.  The guy that wa s doing this, where he ran behind everybody, 

when he saw the people that he overt
ook, he stopped right 
there, those people 
were not strong enough to live anymore, toproduce work, they went to the trucks 

and went to the gas chambers.  Because they had more people, they br ought Jews 

from all over the world in Europe and they
 wanted the healthy one to ma ke use of 
their strength.  But I was always running 
fast and I was always able to keep up 
and that™s how I survived.  But what happe
ned is when I did all this extra work I 
got extra soup.  And one day this same  guy that was asking for volunteers and I 

always went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me  the soup and you saw all 
the rest of the people just dying to ge
t a bite of some thing and nobody could get 
nothing.  You see them dying, starving.  But 
then he asked for a volunteer to wash 
the kettle out. And I was very gladly 
going to wash the kettle because this guy 
didn™t care about how he di
pped out.  The best stuff was in the bottom of t he 
kettle.  
 
Q: This was another 
prisoner, this guy? 
 

A: No, this was one of the Gestapo.  And wh
en I come  there to volunteer to wash the 
kettle and I was one of the volunteers, 
I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him 
say to me , you swine and he hit me  on my 
side with his right hand and he busted 
my ear drum.  And since then I had nothi
ng but pain and even after I got liberated, 
I went to doctors in Germany and doctor
s in everywhere and I finally ended up 
here in Washington a place with the ear c
linic where a doctor said to me, I have 

one choice, have the operation because it™s so
 deteriorated that 
it™s going to affect 
my brain and it™s pressing against my  brain 
and that I don™t have much to live.  So 
I authorized him to operate on me  and he
 took the mastoid out completely and I 
have a ma stoid, a plastic one and I don™t he
ar in my left ear.  But thank God the 
operation was very successful.  The doctor to
ld me  I would have to come  in and 
check-ups and things like that.  But tha
nk God whatever it did it took over.  I go 

  
 
16
to see him e very couple of years or so and I have no problem.  So anyway I was in 
Gleiwitz. 
 

Q: How did they take you from Auschw
i t z to Gleiwitz, again by train? 
 

A: No, no, by truck.  We  were working in 
Gleiwitz and building 
the factory and me  
doing the side works and me getting a li
ttle soup a couple of times a week, 
because it wa sn™t every day.  And so I was comi ng along. 
 

Q: So the work the wome n were doing as 
you were building the factory they started 
doing work in the factory? 
 

A: They ran the machinery and they as a 
ma tter of fact, when they got through for 
the day, their faces, the whole thing, was 
covered with the dust, with bl ack dust, 
just like your hair black.  That™s what 
the job they did.  A
nd afterwards one day 
while we™re being there and I™m telling 
you every day ----- I l
ook outside in the 
street and I see people wa lking, cars and 
the highway and I said to myself, I don™t 
know, will I ever be able to walk free, will 
I ever be  able to walk free.  There was 
no such thing as tryi ng to plan an escape because where are you going to go.  

There™s no pl ace to go.  They will catc
h you.  And so we don™t know anything 
what goes on in the world.  We  don™t know nothing.  And one day they tell us 

they have to evacuate us.  They opene
d up all the warehouses and everybody was 
running crazy, grabbing a loaf of bread. 
 

Q: This was the winter. 

 
A: The winter, oh was it winter.  We  we
nt, I don™t reme mber, two or three days 
walking through the woods up to here in s
now.  And when the nightfall came they 
just tell us freeze or di e or  some thing 
and we just kept on walking.  And anybody 
just couldn™t walk anymore, they just s
hot you and left you right there.  And there 
is one thing that I had with me  that wa
s another guy by the name  of Shia Spiegel 
who was from Poland, from Bengene and he
 and I sort of teamed up to look out 
for one another.  We ll, when everybody we
nt crazy and got a loaf of bread, I took 
a loaf of cheese, like a lo
af of American cheese, five
 pounds and I put it in my 
belt and covered over with this and I carri
ed because two days later the bread was 
gone and you had to ma rch.  And if anybody ha
d any bread they killed you for it, 
or food or some thing.  So I used to reach
 inside and take a piece of cheese, break 

off a piece and hold it in my hand, and I had him lay down in my arms like this 

and I fed him and he ate the piece of cheese,
 or he did that to me  and this is how 
we survived.  Then we came to a place wher
e there were railroad cars where they 
were going to transport us.  Yeah, there is 
one more thing that I did.  I became  an 
expert in concrete, and not
 just concrete, also to 
make the steel because the 
concrete is usually reinforced by steel. 
 I became an expert in st eel.  They 
promoted me to build the individual air 
shelters for the Gestapo all around the 
camp.  Basi cally it was built like four feet
 deep on the location, round.  Then we 

had a place where we had to design that we
 built forms like barrel sections with a 

  
 
17
narrow opening from the  back.  And lookout
 that  was wide and narrow to the 
fr ont.  And then we put a dome  on it.  We  built this whole thing by hand and then 
we loaded it on a two -wheel cart and we pushed it to the location.  And when we 

got to the location we left clamps that we
 put nuts and bolts to tie it together, the 
section.  Then we put the dome on it. That™s
 what I was doing.  That was my last 
job with a crew of people. 
 

Q: Those warehouses that they opened we
re those in the SS part of the camp? 

 

A: They opened up everywhere.  And ever
ywhere people could go in and people ---- 
we went crazy trying to find food, all they 
could find.  And so when we got to the 

railroad, when they were evacuating us, 
they ma de us go into the wagon.  It was 

open; it was cold; it was snow so deep; 
it was absolutely blizzard. In our wagon 
there was a hundred and eighty people because
 when they tell the people to go in I 

saw this with my eyes:  the Gestapo r
ook the rifle with the heavy side and hit 
people over the shins, over the feet, so th
ey will back up so they can get more 
people up.  And no ma tter how they did, 
they still couldn™t get everybody on 
there.  What happened to the people then, I have no idea.  But we left.  When 

mi dnight came the train took off.  The first 
morning there were thirty people dead 

in our own wagon.  We  drove in this 
wagon for about eight days.  Nobody ever 
gave us anything to eat.  To get water, 
I ma de out of whatever I could find from 
striped shirts, from coats like a rope
 with a hat and dragging it down on the 
ground as the train was going 
to get snow for water. 
 

Q: These were the open cars, you said? 

 
A: The open cars.  Out of our wagon when we were unloaded in Oranienburg, there 
were three people from my wagon left, 
everybody died.  Three people in my 
wagon, Shia Spiegel, one, me  and some body else.  And the only reason we  
survived because I got the snow for wate
r and I got the cheese that I ma de him 
and he ma de  me  eat and nobody could ever find out. 
 

Q: So it lasted you that whole time ?  

 

A: Right, a little piece at a time. 

 

Q: What did you do with the dead bodies?   
We re they still on the train with you? 
 

A: First of all when there was enough peopl
e, people just dumped them overboard.  
But then there was nobody to do it anymore 
so everybody that just died, they just 
died.  I saw a ma n dying who was out of 
his mi nd, shivering, things like that.  
And I found out that he was born in the to
wn right next to my town and I just 
couldn™t believe it.  And so when I got 
to Oranienburg I was 
still in pretty good 
shape.  And as I was walking, this wa s 
I believe an air hangar for airplanes or 

some thing.  And believe it or not, I 
come  across some body that we grew up 
together.  We were together practically every day.  And his name  is David 

  
 
18
Yegher, too.  And he lives in Lakewood,New Jersey right now.  He wrote his 
biography.  He wrote it so the 
kids would have.  He has it 
in there that I saved his 
life.  I don™t know how I did it 
but I got some  food for him.  On top of being sick 
what it was he was also wounded from 
air raid.  And I bandaged him up and I 
stayed with him until they were looking for healthy people and they picked me 

again and guess where they sent me -- to
 Bergen-Belsen.  I wa s in Bergen-Belsen 
and I saw like your eyes would never want to
 see.  Just like flies people dying all 
over the streets and there was a wagon th
at was being pushed by people like us 
picking them up and just dumping them in the wagon and you see a hand or a leg 

or some thing stuck in the wheel or some
thing and they just pushed the wa gons 
and pushed the wagons.  I didn™t know where they were taking them but they 

were just picking up the dead like you pick
 up logs or some thing.  And again they 
are looking for some body that is still in good 
health and I still wa
s.  That™s when I 
lost, I separated from my friend 
because he was no longer able. 
 

Q: David Yegher, the other David Yegher? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Spiegel. 

 

A: Spiegel.  So when they took me  to Be
rgen-Belsen and I wasstill with Spiegel, 
from Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen, when
 I got to Bergen-Belsen, again they 
were looking for people that were still 
in pretty good shape and I still was and 
they took me  to Oranienburg. 
 
Q: Back to Oranienburg. 
 

A: No, no, no, from Oranienburg to Belsen-B
elsen and from Belsen-Belsen they took 
me  to Ha mburg.  They was a place called Desaoofa.  Now, in Desaoofa where my 

strength came  to an end, they took me  out
 in the morning to repair the railroads 
and the bridges that were bombed during thenight.  We  alwa ys rode in some  sort 

of a transport car, truck to get to th
e place or  by train to where the place was 
bombed and we were repairing.  But to 
come back, most of the time we couldn™t 
ride back because either the bridge was 
bombed, either the train was not available 

or some thing, we had to walk.  So we walked and by the time we got to the place 

into Desaoofa they had saved a kettle for soup for us because we were important  

people to give us.  But when we got ther
e and they brought out 
the kettle of soup 
and we got in line, everybody got in line
.  And the guy was very nice; he took the 
soup and he dumped it on the floor and we
 didn™t get nothing to eat.  And during 
the night was air raids.  We had to go dow
n to the baseme nt but the baseme nt was 
full of water when we get down.  It took me
 four  months to get me to the point 
where I could no longer stand on my  feet.  They loaded me  into railroad cars that 

we were told we™re going back to Belsen-B
elsen.  The reason we were shipped to 
Bergen-Belsen they should put us in the gas chambers or whatever in the 

crematorium to get rid of us.  But, God was with us.  What happened was the 

  
 
19
whole time that they tried to reach Berg
en-Belsen, there was air raids.  They 
bombed this track, they bombed this trac
k.  They shifted us back and forth and 
they never reached Bergen-Belsen.  
 

Q: You saw and heard the raids? 

 

A: Oh sure.  As a ma tter of fact I was 
in one place whereby we were a little wooded 
area but we were not allowed to go into the 
shelters.  But to the left of us -- there 
was three corners.  One was like a milita
ry, like a post office whatever it was and 
one was an air shelter where all the Germ
ans ran in and one was a bridge.  Three 
bombs were direct hits.  Our place wa s vi
brating like you coul dn™t be lieve it.  And 
then they called us to come  to the air sh
elter and to move the stuff.  We  removed 

the dead bodies and things like that but nothing happened to us.  So when they 

couldn™t get us anymore to Bergen-Belsen, 
they unloaded us in a place called 
Zamposten.  In this place, Zamposten, it wasn™t a concentration camp, it was ---- 

of course it was guarded, it di
dn™t have electric wires wh
atever it was but it was a 
prisoner of war camp.  And they unloaded 
us inn this place called Zamp osten and 
this was how shall I say it was like a ghost camp because there was no mo veme nt 

because everybody was weak and dying and so on. 
 

Q: These were soldiers.  This wa
s a POW camp so there were ---? 
 

A: I was too weak to know.  All I know is I 
was told that this 
is a prisoner of war 
camp.  I wa nt you to know I am not 
a weakling.  I want you to know my 
condition, the way I felt and I™m never going 
to forget that.  
I™m always hunting, 
looking to find some thing to eat.  I fina
lly found a potato and I finally dragged 
myself to the trees to find some  li mb s tobe able to build a fire to cook the potato, 

bake it or some thing. 
 

Q: Where did you find the potato? 

 

A: I found it some place.  But would you be
lieve  it I couldn™t accomplish my goal 
because I didn™t have the strength after I found a match.  I couldn™t have the 

strength to light the ma tch.  Could you 
believe that.  I was getting weaker and 
weaker and weaker by the mi nute and I wa
s already in a situation that I didn™t 

know, I didn™t know, I couldn™t get up, I c
ouldn™t move and I was ----- but I don™t 
know what happened in the next I don™t 
even know how ma ny days, I just don™t 
reme mber.  All I know is I was lifting my head one day and I saw the Germans 

running and the British running after them
.  Then I looked again and I saw the 
British running back and the Germ
ans running after the British. 
 

Q: This was from your barracks? 

 

A: From my ba rrack through the window. 
 Then I saw the Germans and the British 
chasing them and that was the end  Bu
t the next thing I knew, I reme mb er, you 
see the movies where there was people skin and bone, that™s how I was.  My thigh 

  
 
20
right here I could take it
 around with my fingers.  I reme mber one thing that 
some body c o mi ng with scissors and cutting 
off the striped pants and the shirt I 
had on and lifting me  up and putting 
me  on a blanket which was put on a 
stretcher.  I reme mber some body putting some  kind of powde r or whatever it was 

and covering me  with a blanket and that
™s all I know.  I don™t reme mber nothing 
else until I came to in  that used to be 
a German military barrack what they turned 
into like a hospital.  I reme mber them
 feeding me like you feed a baby with a 
bottle, the sweet milk.  I reme mber them th
at after that giving me  the broth from a 
potato.  Then I reme mbe r  them giving me  th
e brot h with a little 
potato in it.  And I 
have started to recover really ni ce.  Then I made a mi stake because there were 

Germans, workers that were working 
for the military and some body did me  a 
favor by giving me  a piece of his sandwic
h.  I had two bites and I swallowed it 
and I was dying.  I reme mber one of the military doctors, because there wa s a few 

doctors around trying to do whatever they
™re going to do and I heard one saying, I 
can™t let this one die because he is my 
challenge and he revived me .  It took me  
four months to be able to stand on my feet
 and being able.  After that I just got up 
one day and they told me  where are 
you going to go, what are you going to eat, 
what are you going to be.  I says, where I™m going to go God knows, but I™m 

going to go anywhere and everywhere 
to look for anybody that I can find to 
survive.  And everywhere there was a cam
p that I heard of I somehow ma naged to 
get there by stopping in, begging for food, thi
ngs like that.  What can I tell you.  I 
me t at the time  people, German people, who fed me , who cried when they heard 

my story.  I also had people tell me  that
 they are going to ge
t even with America 
because they said the reason they lost 
the war was because America bombed their 
cities, their villages and their towns and th
ey™re going to get even with America.  I 
went in and I searched all over the 
Germany whe r e it was under the British 
occupation.  Then I wanted to know if I 
can find some more people.  So I went 
across the border.  I just don™t know.  They
 were so strict of having people going 
across the border. 
 

Q: Whichborder? 

 

A: Between the British zone to the American
 zone.  But I fooled all of them and I 
went across to the American occupied terr
itory.  This is how I came  to America, 
from the American zone. 
 

Q: What year did you emigrate? 

 

A: I came to the United States in 1948.  It 
was April 17 that I came  into the United 
States. 
 

Q: Between the time you were released fr
om the hospital and emigrating you were 
going to various camps, that™s how your time was occupied. 
 

A: Yes I was going to various camps and I was living in vari ous camps until one day 
that lady found me .  That changed my  life. 
 And of course, the 
rest is history.  

  
 
21
When I landed in New York and I came in and I was sponsored by the United 
Jewish Appeal.  But I wa s sponsored to 
come  to America I don™t even know who 
the people were that I was 
assigned to go west.  So when I came  to Ne w York I 
ran into some people.  They knew of my
 people, I ran into some  people that I 
knew at the Hotel Marseille, 103
rd
 Street and Broa dway.  Wh en they came to me  
and they told me that they
 have me  assigned and when a m I ready to go west and I 
said to them I™m sorry I don™t know west, 
east.  All I know is that I found a few 
people.  It™s not my relatives but it™s so
me  people, a few people that I knew and to 
me  this is my fa mily.  And I said I like to stay here.  And they said to me  well, 

they want me to know if I stay that I w
ill be st rictly on my own.  They cannot be 
responsible for me  or give me  any a ssist
ance or financial or 
anything like that.  

And I said to them, haven™t you done enough 
for me  already.  You brought me  out 
to America.  I guarantee you that I won™t 
be no burden to you.  In a country like 
this where you can go out and have a job 
and make a living.  And they said okay 
you™re on your own and I™ve been on my
 own.  I worked, I got a job, I was 

working in this place.  Oh, I worked ha
rd.  I was ma king $50 a week and I worked 
fr om eight o™clock in the morning until elev
en o™clock at  night seven days a week. 
 

Q: Was this a factory? 

 

A: No, cooking.  And so after working a year
 I got a raise, not 
money, but I me an I 
got working six days. 
 

Q: You got a day off?  

 

A: Yeah, then after working two years over
 there I heard about the Catskills and I 
heard about the places.  I we
nt to work as an assistan
t chef to a place which was 
very well known at the time called Pioneer
 Country Club at Gr eenfield Park, New 
York which was kosher, strictly kosher.  They were so impressed with me , they 

had a hotel, the Edwards Hotel in Florida,
 they were paying me  some  ass i stant 
chef $150, so I went from $50 to $150.  But I went to Florida and worked for 

them.  As first chef I went from $150 to $400.  I worked for them two yea r s. Then 

I got to be  so well known because the people who have eaten where they stayed 

and people came from other hotels because 
they liked the food so much that I had 
two agents who were signing up my  jobs.  I 
did that for ten years and believe it or 
not I did that from 1950 to ™51 actually.  That was the first year
 I went until  ™58 
when I came  to Wa shington.  I was in 
those years ma king a thousand dollars a 
week because while I was in German
y hunting around and finding places where 
DP™s were, DP ca mps, so I used to work 
in hotels and restaura
nts and I learned to 
bake and butcher and do everything and th
is was my profession.  So when I came 
to Wa shington, I didn™t realize then, I was 
the chef, one of the most popular, the 
best restaurant in Wa shingt
on, Duke Zieberts.  I was ther
e four and a half years.  
Then I went into business for myself 
and I operated Yegher™s kosher caterers.  
When you work, whatever money you ma
ke, you know I had a fa mily and kids, 

you are just not able to save a lot of m
oney but I was able to save up $3,000 and I 
went into the business.  I ma de a 
very good living and I sold it for $1,010,000 

  
 
22
cash.  I sold it and I went 
into the Pavilion in the Old Post Office and I left 
September a year ago, the Pavilion. 
 
Q: You sold that restaurant too? 

 

A: Well there was nothing to sell.  My l
ease was up and while I was there I just 
didn™t ma ke any money.  It was just a ve
ry bad arrangeme nt.  Everybody that ever 
goes in there has a hard time.  It™s ju
st not a mone y proposition because it™s so 

over-rated and it looks so glor
ious and looks so over, ove
r, over  promoted that 
people just don™t realize 
you just can™t ma ke a living.  I know people there who 
are absolutely starvi ng in business.   They
 have no money to take care of their 
children and no money to live, just waiting for -- you know.  So I ma naged to 

hold on because I didn™t have 
to hire no chef.  I didn™t 
have to hire no expensive 
whatever you want to call it and I was ab
le to hold out until 
my lease is up and I 
just took my equipment and I came out here. 
 My situation right 
here, I hope to be 

able to find a bank who™s going to lend me
 mone y to build a road.  What you see 
right here I own nineteen acr
es with all of them build
ings and it™s all fr ee and 
clear..  And I™m hoping to get a loan a
nd then I™m going to open and then I™m 
going to retire. 
 

Q: Will this be a kosher inn or -----? 

 

A: Well, it has a lot of ifs and buts about it. 
 For this to be kosher, I would like it to 
be kosher, but if it™s not going to be koshe
r is because it will be determined that 
it™s just not a market to support it.  So
 it all depends, it all depends.  I haven™t 
really deci ded yet but I will have to do 
-- remember one thing, I am a survivor.  
I™m going to do whatever I have to do to survive. 
 
Q: I did have a question if you don™t mi nd 
going back a little bit about what you 
reme mber about the first occupation of your town. 
 

A: Oh, how can I forget, I mean it started 
little things, slowly.  You have no idea.  
First you had to register.  After you register
ed they imposed various restrictions.  
You couldn™t walk from one town to the 
other; you couldn™t be out at night; you 
couldn™t have no windows facing the ma in road, have to be blocked. 
 

Q: Did you live on that ma in road? 

 

A: Yes, and they were deporting Jews 
what they called it where people had to 
evacuate because of the front lines and they
 needed people to work the fields.  So 
they came in with this clever thing by
 saying that all the 
Jews who don™t have 
enough me a ns of living and supporting themse
lves and what they have within 
their farm.  For instance; we had no 
problems; we had enough food, we had 
enough things, we had enough things we neve
r needed to leave the farm.  We  had 
wheat, bread, you know all the things 
in the summe r, in the winter. 
 

  
 
23
Q: You were self sufficient. 
 

A: Self suffi cient, and we even sold a lot.
  So there was no problem with us but there 
were Jews taken who were very cleverly 
mi srepresented because they were taking 
Jews to Galicia and then we found out th
ey weren™t taking them to work, they 
were taking them and they dug deep trenches
 and shot them all.  But there were 
some  people that some body, some how, that 
the word got out.  Wherever they did, 
they did it in such a way by always givi
ng you a reason.  We  need to evacuate the 

people because the ones that don™t have
 enough sufficient to sustain, to live, 

whatever they have on their farm because they are not allowe d to work, you™re 

not allowed to walk, you have to stay on 
your farm, those are the Jews that they 
took.  Then they come  to the Jews and th
ey said, well everybody of such and such 
age had to report to the military.  That™s 
when they took my brother.  Then they 

came again and they said no school, no Jews
 are allowed to go to school; no Jews 
are allowed to congregate; no Jews are 
allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews 
are allowed to have communications of 
any kind with one another.  Everything 
you have on the farm you have to deliver 
to such and such a place, whatever the 
crops and things like that.  I reme mb er my
 father dug a hole in the barn and put in 
sacks of wheat so we would have.  In case whatever, in reserve or some thing.  But 

we didn™t know that when you put in s acks of wheat in the ground and the wheat 

touches the ground on the side, th
e wheat turns to dirt.   
It started cultivation and 
growing.  When we uncovered it, whatever
 it had, lumber on the top and hay or 
some thing, there was only a little bit in the mi ddle that was still useable.  

Everything else was all turned.  We  ha
d no experience.  We  had known we would 
have put lumber on the side, on the botto
m but we didn™t know.  When we didn™t 
have wheat we ground the beans for flour 
and made some  kind of bread out of 
beans because we just couldn™t get because even in the farm when you get 

whatever you get in the winter time you have
 to be able to exchange and trade and 
ma rket, you just cannot ---- We  were lucky because we, now for instance, 

potatoes -- we dug a hole in the ground and 
we put straw on the outside and on the 
bottom and then we covered with straw and we put dirt on it, it was just like 

fields.  Then we used to go and dig ou
t potatoes.  So we
 always found some 
things.  Every day of course you 
had to wear the Star of David. 
 

Q: Did you have to ma ke it at home, did some body distribute them?  

 

A: I don™t remember, I don™t reme mber of th
ey distributed it or you ma de it or you 
got it, I have no idea.  And as always 
there was never a let down.  There was 
never a let down one day that they would 
leave you alone.  There was always this 
constant harassment, nudging -- today you ha
ve to do this, today you have to do 
this, today you have to do this cons
tantly.  And they wore you down, wore you 
out, wore you down. 
 

A: How old we re you when decrees beganﬂ 

 

A: I was thirteen years old. 

  
 
24
 
Q: Had you begun gymnasium or were 
you going on in school at that point? 
 

A: What are you talking about?  
 I only had four years of 
public school.  That™s it.  I 
had very little schooling but 
I did have training in Jewi
sh, I went to cheder.  I 
learned in cheder.  I know how to daven pr
etty good.  I know all 
there is to know.  
I lear ned from my father.  I was with him ---- 
 

Q: You carried his entrepreneurial spirit. 

 

A: I mean he used to pray all the time and he
 used to be so observant and so religious 
and such a good person. 
 

Q: He wore a beard? 

 

A: No, he didn™t wear no beard but he used 
some  kind of paste to dissolve the hair or 
some thing because you™re not allowed to use a razor.  But anyway ---- 
 

Q: What about anti-Semitism by the Roma nians? 

 

A: Oh, I had anti-Semitism all the time.  I grew up with that.  Let me tell you 
some thing.  I was a tough kid, and I mean
 I was a tough kid.  I was not bothered 
by anybody because to me , I would never back
 down and even if I encountered ---
--- I encountered a bunch of school, my younger age you know, and there was 

some body by the name  of Kuza that they ha
d thought, he got afte
r the Jews at the 
time, even before the Germans ca me.  
And they got surrounded me  and they 
wanted me  to say Treaska Kuza which m
eans in Roma nian long live Kuza.  And I 
wouldn™t say it. 
 

Q: Kuza, that wa s part of the governme nt real anti-Se mite -------? 

 

A: That was the guy like George Lincoln 
Rockwell over here.  And Kuza organized 
me n who we re going on the trains and when
 they found a Jew they threw him off 
the train while the train was running, th
rough the window, beat him up and things 
like that.  So anyway they tried to get me
 to say Treaska Kuza and I wouldn™t say 

it.  But I knew one thing.  There was about
 five, six kids my age and I knew that if 
I took care of the leader that they woul
d scatter.  They had me surrounded and the 
guy who wa s the leader was telling to me  
to say Treaska Kuza and I got closer 

and closer to him and I used my right foot 
and I kicked him in the balls.  He bent 
over screaming and when he did the rest 
of them, and I hit him afterwards, and I 
said who is next?   And they all ran awa
y.  That was one thing and I was attacked 
another time.  I was a tough kid.  So
mebody was going to hit me  and I took his 
arm and I was going to put him over my 
shoulder, flip him over, but I did a 
terrible thing, what I did I had his hand backwards and I broke his arm.  Nobody 

bothered me  again.  They knew I was a tough kid.  When I went to school even I 

also spoke very good Roma nian and the te
acher was trying to break up the Jewish 

  
 
25
kids, there was two in a bench and so they got and they put one gentile and one 
Jew because they wanted not that the Jewish
 kid to be able to talk in Yiddish and 
carry on together.  But there was me  and 
one mo re kid from the other end of the 
town.  They let us sit together.  Well 
they said because we spoke fluently, 
Roma nian, so they didn™t have to do it.  
But whatever it was -- I was a tough kid.  
 

Q: Did your father, was he ever 
harassed singly within the town? 
 

A: Well, we were constantly harassed, no que
stion about it, constantly harassed.  I 
reme mber one time, I don™t remembe r  exactly what happened.  Somebody, I don™t 

know, hit my father with a rifle and my fa
ther told my sister to go and get the 
police because we were on pretty good terms with the police.  My mother 

wouldn™t let her out of the house.  As a ma
tter of fact it™s a good thing she didn™t 
because the guy was outside who hit my fath
er, he was outside  in the street and 
after a few mi nutes if my sister, if a
nybody would have come  out he would have 
shot us.  But instead of shooting us he 
used his rifle to s
hoot and he shot the 
geese.  There was a flock of geese and he 
shot the geese with the bullets.  And so 
my mother, she wouldn™t let my sister go 
out and she just stayed in the house 
down until he left .  What can I tell you.  This transport that went fr om Gleiwitz to 

Oranienburg that was a suffering.  I™m telling you.  There were some  people that 

got off the train when the train had to 
slow down, whatever, and they started to 
run away.  They were just 
shot, they were just shot. 
 

Q: Were you able to get a blanket or an
ything when they opened those warehouses 
before that trip? 
 
A: No,no. 
 

Q: So you were just exposed? 

 

A: You better believe it.  You stay close 
together and when one side is warm you 
turn the other side
 to each other. 
 

Q: What did you do me ntally?   Do you reme
mber?   How did you deal me ntally with 
that kind of hardship?   Do you think you™re going to ma ke it through or do you 

just agree to accept the inevitabl e? 
 

A: No, no, no, you never think of that.  You c
onstantly think what to do to survive.  
You constantly plan what to do, how to 
do, what to survive.  You don™t think of 

it™s good, you don™t think of it™s 
bad.  It™s just like some
body is out in the desert 
and they™re dying from t hirst and when you 
see them in the movies, when they™re 
running, when they see water, what do you 
think these people are going to be 
thinking of?   Their entire body and mind and 
soul and power and strength is just 

to get to that water.  We ll that™s the 
kind of conditioned that you become  that you 
constantly like fatigue just thinking wher
e can I find something to eat.  You don™t 
think of nothing else.  You just think, 
how can I survive the next hour.  And you 

  
 
26
are constantly thinking just of that.  And there is nothing else because you are in 
such a pain for hunger , you™re in such a pain trying to find some thing to eat that 

you just don™t ever have a
nything else on your mi nd.  You™re just frustrated, how 
can I find some thing to eat to get rid of 
the pain.  And that™s the way the whole 
situation is.  And you constantly ma ni
pulate and ma neuver and you constantly 
look to find some thing, some thing that you 
can eat, constantly.  You constantly 

plan where to be.  When I used 
to do the side  work all the time. 
 

Q: Thegardening? 

 

A: The gardening and polishing the shoes and 
ma king the beds and things like that.  
That™s what it took and you™re 
just so helpless, you™re ju
st so useless, you™re just 
so without nothing you can do.  It™s ju
st like you see so ma ny people dying, you 

see so ma ny people starving, you see so
 ma ny people, there™s nothing you can do, 
there™s nothing you can do.  It™s just lik
e you are walking along the roads and 
there™s an earthquake and you get covered 
and you™re dying.  What can you do?   
Nothing!  There™s nothing you can do.  And I don™t know why is there always that 

some body always come s up in a generation a
nd always has the right, he feels he 
has the right to destroy the Jews.  I don™
t know.  I don™t know.  I just don™t know.  
All of a sudden the Jewish life become s so cheap and so nobody sets any value on 

it and Jewish life -- I me an I saw the crematoriums.  
 

Q: AtAuschwitz? 

 

A: Yes.  I mean how in the world can ever be some body ever able to do 
systematically like a lumber factory, 
like a manufacturer that produces cars, 
systematically gassing and burning hu
ma n beings, never mi nd Jews, just 
some body.  What in the world does ever a
nybody ever has gotten the idea that he 
has the right to do that.  How in the wo
rld?   I just  recently applied for the 
Wi edergud Machel because I just never wa
nted anything from them beca use I  
just never wanted anything from them.  Bu
t some of my fr iends just talked me 
into it by saying, you™re going to get ol d, you never know what™s going to happen, 

why shouldn™t you be able to get some thi
ng out of it?   They took enough from 
you.    So, but it™s already too late.  Anyw
ay I filed with the Mead organization in 
New York.  They told me that they 
mi ght be able to overturn some thing, 
whatever.  You can never tell.  But the s
ituation is ------ Because I™m a Holocaust 

survivor and because of this area I have
 been approached ma ny different ways, 
ma ny different time s, especially when they had the Eichma nn trials I had been 

followed by reporters.  Wanted to
 know what I™m going to say. 
 

Q: Yourreaction? 

 

A: Reaction. I was also on te
levision.  There was a guy here
 on Alan King show that 
he was the one that hunted down Klaus Barbie.  I was on TV because he wanted 

to have some body to talk about.

Q: LarryKing? 
 

A: Larry King, yeah.  And so my last stat
ement was that I hope that the world would 
learn what a horrible thing the Nazis did to
 the world and to the Jews especially.  
And I hope that never again would anything 
ever be instituted some thing of that 
nature and whatever.  So I had quite 
a few calls because I was in the kosher 
catering and I was very well honored with 
dignity and respect.  People knew me  
and they called mw to tell me  what a 
wonderful thing I did and said.  So we™re 
going to have a Holocaust Museum here? 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I hope to God that it will be there to
 be able to that the world never forgot 
what the world did and a lot of it could 
have been prevented but the world didn™t 
lift a finger.  And again we were al
one and no defense, nobody.  And the people 
that could do, didn™t.  They ma de it that 
they didn™t want to 
be involved.  Well, I 
hope to God that the State of Israel will 
exist and be able to because God forbid 
this time  and God forbid if the State 
of Israel should ever be destroyed or 
overpowered that there wouldn™t be no more 
State of Israel  and this time  we will 

not escape.  It will be the end of the Je
wish for sure and that
 I can tell you because 
as ma ny enemies we got now and as ma ny ways they now know how to 

exterminate and will be absolutely merciless.
