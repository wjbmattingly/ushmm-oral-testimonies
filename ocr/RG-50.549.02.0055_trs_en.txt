Interview with Gera
ld S. von Halle 
July 10, 1999 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: This is tape one, side A, of an
 interview with Gerry 
von Halle, conducted by 
Ginger Miles, on July 10
th
, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
This is a follow up interview of a United 
States Holocaust Memo rial Museum video 
interview, conducted in 1990
. The United States Holocaust 
Memo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. First thing I want to 
ask is the full names of your parents and 
-- and siblings, and wh ere they were born. 
Answer: O-Okay . My father -- My father™s
 name was Oscar von Halle. He was born in 
Rustock, Germany, moved to Ha
mburg. He was an architect. He -- He -- He di -- He left 
Germany with our family in 
1933, as soon as Hitler came to
 power, and stayed  in -- he 
left Germany and went to Amsterdam, Holla
nd. We stayed in Amsterdam, Holland from 
1933, throughout the war. He didn™t see the end of the war. 
He was arrested while we 
were in hiding. My mother and I escaped, an
d he stayed in a Dutch concen tration camp  
for some time, and then was transported 
to Au schwitz, and died
 in Auschwitz. My 
mo ther ba -- she was born, her name was He
nrietta von Halle, maiden name was Cohen, 
she was born in Berlin. She -- After marrying 
my  father, she moved to Hamburg. Same 
thing, in 1933, with my fa
ther, and my  brother and I, moved to Amsterdam, and she 
survived the war, after having 
been in hiding for several years, and came to the United 
States in 1946, and died here in the Unite
d States. She was a -- She was a nurse during

World War One, treating German
 soldiers, and when she came
 to the United States, she 
became a baby nurse, took care of
 several important families,
 including Senator Javitz™ 
children, she -- she was the baby nurse for th
em, and died here. My brother, his name was 
Hans dash Yurg en von Halle
. He was born in Hamburg in 1921, moved to, with my  
family obviously , mo ved to Amsterdam in 1933,
 went to s -- high school -- to primary 
school and high school there.
 And he was one of the very  
first Jews, together with me, 
who were arrested in Amsterdam. The year 
was 1941, we were -- there were 250 young 
German Jews arrested , and underline the wo
rd German, only German Jews, between the 
ages of 16 and 21. 
Q: May I ask you why do you thi
nk th at it was only German Jews? 
A: At that time the Germans had a system. They
 felt if th ey could get first rid of German 
Jews, that wouldn™t disturb the Du tch Jews 
too much. The one thing 
they didn™t want is 
any kind of -- I don™t want to call it an uprisi
ng, but they  didn™t want any trouble. And by 
taking th e German ga -- the Germans developed 
a system where they 
took one part of a 
group of Jews. They didn™t just arrest Jews, 
it was always a group of Jews, it was first the 
German Jews, then the male -- male Jews be
tween the ag es of 16 and 21, then another 
little group, then another little group. There was 
always a group, so that everybody else 
still felt, ﬁOh my God, thank 
goodness they didn™t take me
.ﬂ And this was the German 
mode of operation, one group at a time. Then
 they took people who were not married. It 
was young people if not marri
ed, then young people to a ce
rtain age, who were married. 
You know, it was always
 a group of people.

Q: It makes me wonder, between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews, before that time, 
did you communicate with the other Jewish community? 
A: Oh yes, indeed, indeed. 
Q: Could you talk abou
t that a little bit? 
A: Well the -- the -- the Jews of Holland were ve
ry liberal in their -- 
in their -- in their 
life, at -- it -- they -- we 
had perfect communication, there was no difference between the 

German Jews and the Dutch Jews. There wa
s no anti-Semitism that
 I was aware of. I 
spoke fluently Dutch, so did my  brother. A
nd nobody ever asked, you know, where were 
you born. We were -- We were 
Jews, living in Holland. As fact
, we were living next door 
to Anne Frank. Anne Frank and I grew up to
gether, and our history is almo st identical. 
Yo -- Which of course I have recorded previo
usly, at the -- at the Holocaust Museum in -- 
in Washington and -- etcetera. 
Q: The Frank family, were th
ey distinctive in any way? 
A: No, no. He was -- He was a businessm
an who started -- who was a successful 
busin essman in Frankfurt. He -- He came to
 Holland, and to Amsterdam, and started a 
new business, and it was in that business of his, on the princinkraft which -- where the 

family and some other people were  hiding. It
 was in his busin ess, and of course the story 
is well known, I™m not going to  go thro ugh th
at story. He was -- He was an average 
businessman, and the girls -- 

Q: And he was friends with your family? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55

A: No, no. I would not say th
ey were -- we were friends. We were -- We knew each 
other, let™s put it that way, and that™s about 
-- don™t forget the girls -- Anne was six or 
seven years younger than I was, and when  I 
came to Amsterdam, I was 11, and Anne was 
five. And as an 11 year old boy, you do not ha
ve too much connections with  a five year 
old girl. And even  though her si
ster was, I think, two years older, but she also was mu ch 
younger. So -- 
A: How about your pre-war reco
llection then, of anti-Semitism? 
Q: None -- Well, except for the fact that H
itler came to power in 1933, in -- I believe it 
was January, and of course we had -- the Na
zi moveme nt was very active in Germany, 
and as far as that is co ncerned, we -- we 
were -- I wa -- I wouldn™t say suffering, it was 
1933, we were very mu ch aware of wh at 
the Nazi movement was all about. And my  
father decided -- he was a very successful ar
chitect in Hamburg, he
 decided he didn™t 
want his two sons to grow 
up under this regime, and ther
efore made the sacrifice of 
leaving his successful busin e
ss, and went to Holland, wh
ere in Ho lland we were not 
allowed to work. Anyways, he
 was not allowed to work . You could live there, but you 
could not wo rk th ere, 
that was the problem. 
Q: How did you make a living?  
A: Well, my father -- my fath
er worked, you might call it ill
egally, for a Dutch bank, was 
a private ban -- it was a -- in -- in -- in Europe
 you have a lot of these private banks, it™s 
not like Chase-Manhattan here, or so, it wa
s just a littl -- little pr
ivate bank, it so 
happened  it was owned by a memb er of the fa
mily, that bank. And 
my  mo th er, sh e to ok

in people to live with us, borders. She took
 in borders and so, between those two, we 
made a -- a -- just barely a living. 
Q: Do you remember feeli
ng poor, or were you glad 
to be in Holland, or -- 
A: No, we never felt poor. It is true that we 
did not have a lot of things that other people 
had, in other words, we didn™t own a car, or you know, we f-finally were able to get a 

bicycle, my brother and I, each. And -- But I ne
ver felt poor, even though I think we were 
poor, but we never felt poor.  
Q: And your experience in the Dutch schools was? 

A: Oh, was perfect. I -- I loved it, I was good 
at it. My -- My best subject was Dutch. I -- 
I -- I got the highest -- the highest numbers in
 -- in -- in Dutch language, and I -- and I 
spoke almost without an  accent. 

Q: As you do now, so -- now, in  going 
into wartime and the connections, your 
connections with the 
underground, with the Dutch underground -- 
A: Right. 

Q: I know at one time you mentioned that 
the undergro und fo und you and your mo ther 

hiding in  a haystack? 
A: Well, no, that -- yes, we were hiding in
 a haystack, but we were on a -- my father -- 
my father, my mother and I -- that was afte
r my brother already ha
d been killed. We™re 
taking ab out the year 1942, my  father, my  
mo ther and I went to a farmhouse, in the 
southern part of Holland, a province of Li
mberg, and there was a problem there, there 
was another family that came, a M r. and Mrs.
 Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55

young lady. Her husband was an accountant, 
and he looked -- I do
n™t know how those 
two ever got married, he was the opposite fro
m her, and she started an affair with the 
farmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a 
very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstan ces, and 
the wife of the farmer found out about it, a
nd sh e -- they had children, and in her despair, 
and I can™t blame her, she went to the Gesta
po and told th em what the problem was, and 
so one day, while we were a
ll sitting for ouch -- we were 
sitting down at dinner time, I 
look -- we looked out 
the window, and there were four or
 five Gestapo ag ents driving up 
and co ming -- you know, running 
into the building. And Mr. 
Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out 
the back door. My father went
 up -- went up in the attic, 
and my mother went into the 
bedroom and I went into a bath room. I mean, it™s -- it™s not a bathroom as we know it in 
America, it™s you know, it™s just a toilet, a
nd there was a little ledge, and I was hiding 
behind th e ledge. And they arrested my  fath
er, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my 
mo ther and I, we -- it™s a long story, really, 
but she was hiding in  a closet, and they -- 
they opened up every 
closet in the house and finally th
ey -- to make a very long story 
short, there™s mu ch mo re to it, but during th
e night, I put up a ladder against the house 
and ma -- got my  mo ther out of the window, a
nd then  we went into a haystack, and then  
after that, there was a young girl -- this wa
s way past midnight -- 
a young girl of the 

Dutch -- of the Dutch underg round, sh-she prob
ably  was no mo re than 16 or 17 years old, 
came on a bicycle to tell us that the -- th-the 
Germans were aware that
 they were -- that 
they had missed two more Jews, that™s my mo
ther and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter,

and so they were on their way back. So, we we
re in a haystack, yes, but only for about a 
couple of hours, until the young girl 
came, and we had to leave there.  
Q: I wanted to ask you what your experi
ences all together were, with the Dutch 
underground, and if you were aided 
by any other philanthropic agency. 
A: No. I had no -- I did not have much experi
ence with the Dutch unde
rground, as a f act, 
I didn™t even know who that young girl was.
 I found out mu ch la
ter, that she was a 
member of the un -- I mean, a member of th
e undergro und, and th e -- the person who had 
originally  -- was helping us, a
nd we were hiding in his apar
tment before we went down to 
the farmhouse, was a professor. I obm -- I went 
to college for one year, and he was one of 
the professors -- 

Q: Where did you go to college? 

A: In Amsterdam. It™s a engineering co lle
ge, which I really wasn™t interested in 
engineering, but my  father thought I should be
 in -- in architecture, which I didn™t want, 
and so I wound up in  -- in engine
ering, wh ich I didn™t want eith
er, but that™s a long story. 
And so, I didn™t know, I had no
 idea until much, much later, 
that Mr. -- that my di -- 
professor, whose name was Mr. Initout, was 
a me mb er of the Dutch undergro und. He 
never told me. It was much la
ter, towards the end of the wa
r, and it was when we -- when 
we fled the farmhouse, we -- we went back to
 Amsterdam, and back  to Mr. Initout, where 
we were originally, in
 his small  a p artment. 
Q: Did he know you were coming? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55

A: Well, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I mad e
 a telephone call from that -- from the train 
station, and told them what had happened, th
at my father was arrested, and -- you know, 
and he was -- he -- he was absolutely great, w
ithout giving it a minute 
thought, he told us 
to come right over, which wasn™t so easy 
because, remember, we were Jews, and I -- I 
look pretty Jewish, and we -- every Jew wa
s supposed to wear a yellow star, which -- 
which we wore, but not after we went into
 hiding. And so here we™re in Amsterdam 
without the Jewish star, and we were not allo
wed to be on a -- on a -- on a -- on a bus or -
- or tram, as they call it in Amsterdam, 
so we had -- we walked all the way from 
Amsterdam central, to Amsterdam west. As fa
ct, he lived only a few blocks from where 
Anne Frank was hiding. So  actually, Anne Fra
nk, after we went into  hiding, we -- known 
-- unbeknown to each other, we were very, very
 close to each other, in -- in distance. 
Q: Is that when your mother
 and you began to live together
 silently in the one room? 
A: In one room. We lived in 
one room from 19 -- we lived in that room for two and a half 
years. Never saw the light, never saw -- I me
an, I saw light, but never saw the sunshine 
coming, never ch -- 

Q: There was no window in  this room? 
A: There was a -- There was a window, yeah, 
you -- you could see th
e light, but you were 
never exposed to the sunshine. In other words,  as you know, in th is country, or in most 
civilized countries, if you™re in prison, you™re 
allowed at least one hour a day of exercise, 
and -- and being exposed to s
unlight and -- and -- and etcetera, etcetera. We have not 
been out of that room fo
r two and a half years.

Q: Wa -- Ya -- I -- I heard your story, and he
aring it, I was so curious that there could be 
all these people coming to visit him, and hi
m a me mb er o f  th e und er
ground, and yet they  
-- are you sure they did not know, or did they
 just not tell that they knew that you and 
your mother were there? 

A: Well, I can™t -- The only thing -- I don™t kn
ow. I don™t know the answer to that. I know 
that his brother-in-law knew that we were 
there because -- and there -- I™m sure there 
were some other people that knew about it, w
ho he felt he could trust. But the -- the sad 
part of the story is that four week s, or a
pproximately four weeks befo re the end of the 
war, he was caught by the Germans on one of
 his missions, he was on a mission, I don™t 
know wh -what his mission was, and he was 
caught and he was executed. And so -- 
Q: How did you and your mo ther find out? 
A: We -- There was, again, somebody from th
e underg ro und who came to the house, t-to 
tell us that terrible news. His wife, incidentally
, had died about a year before, but she died 
of natural causes. So I can™t -- So we were just
 informed of it, and we had to, again, in a 
big, big hurry, to leav
e -- leave the apartment. 
Q: And how was it arranged 
wh ere you would go next? 
A: That was another -- Again, I can™t tell -- th rough the underground, now, I don™t know 

mu ch about it, they had a -- a name  and an 
ad dress for us, it was another teacher and his 
wife, who I™d never met, never heard their na
me mentioned, and that™s where we spent 
the last four weeks.  

Q: And by that time, were the 
professor™s children teenagers? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
11
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, they were -- they had a boy and a gi
rl. The girl was -- The boy was my age, and 
the girl was maybe two years older. 
Q: What was your relationship, if any, with  them? 
A: Well, was a very good relationship. Y-
You -- You can imagine living in  -- in -- you 
know, it was a small apartment.
 They had -- There were th
ree bedrooms, I believe, and 
one was occupied by the -- by th e parents, on
e was occupied by the brother and sister, 

who had separate bedrooms, but because of -- 
because of us coming there, they had to 
share the -- a bedroom, and th
en  my  mo ther and I shared  the other bedroom, and so  it™s 
been a -- 
Q: So they knew you were there? 
A: Oh, yes. Oh yes, oh yes,
 they were -- you know -- 
Q: Did th ey bring you fo od? 
A: Oh yes, yes, yeah. Well, of
 course, food in th -- probably
 the worst part of that entire 
war experien ce was the last six - nine months
, where we had no food. There was no food. 
Now, you might say, how do 
y -- how do you exist on no food? Well, we ate w h at is 
called pulp, which is stuff that is fed to the 
-- to the -- to the cows. And that™s what we 
ate. 
Q: I™m curious to know
 mo re about your friendship with 
the teenage children, especially 
after their father died. Were 
you ab le to keep in touch? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
12
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, yes, as fact, th-the daughter got 
married pretty soon after. She married a -- a 
minister, a -- a Protestant minister. And so me
how over the years, we -- we lost contact 
and the so n, I had brought ove
r here, fo-for a visit, I wanted him to see America. 
Q: How did you -- How do you mean you brought him? 
A: Well, I -- I wanted him to see America, 
and so  we somehow got 
together here in the 
United States for just about a week or 
so. And just showing him around, and -- 
Q: What year was that? 

A: My goodness. I don™t really rememb er, bu
t it was probably, if I came in 1945, I would 
say probably  in 19
 -- early ‚50.  
Q: And did you pay his way,
 or send him money, or -- 
A: It so happened , no, I did not pay his way,
 he came here. He work
ed -- He worked for a 
comp any wh ich had sent him over here, it™s ju
st that he had quite a bit of time on his 
hand, and it was whatever he had to do for hi
s comp any, it -- it did not take that long, and 
so I had a lot of time that I could show him -- I wouldn™t -- I didn™t show him America, 

but I did show him New Yo rk. That™s
 -- That™s as far as I could go. 
Q: I -- It -- Is there anything else you want
 to add before we ge
t to the liberation and 
after? 

A: Well, you know, if I had to do that, I wo
uld have to start from -- from day one, and I 
don™t think, you know, and I™v
e done that, an-and it™s on tape
, and it™s in the Holocaust 
museum in Washington. No, I -- I -- I just would 
say, like I said before, that the last six - 
nine months were horrible, just horrible. 
I mean, again, you might say, comp ared  to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
13
 
 
 
 
what? To the poor people who were in Ausc
hwitz, it wasn™t horrible.
 But I am probably 
one of the few people that know wh at hung
er is. And I s -- when I say hunger, I mean 
hunger. We talk about 
hunger, about poor peop
le in -- in America. Y es, that may be so, 
but that™s not hunger. Hunger 
me ans you have nothing to eat
. You c -- You can eat grass, 
or you can eat, you know, you -- 
you  just have nothing to eat, there was nothing, nothing 
to eat. And -- And that was not just us, I me
an , the Dutch people living in Amsterdam. 
And one of the reasons was, because Holland 
was -- the southern part of Holland was 
liberated already in 1944. There was one little
 pocket of Holland, th e province of north -- 
north Holland, which had Amster
dam, and Rotterdam, an d The Hague in there, that little 
pocket, it™s a -- you know, it™s a -- Holland is
 a small country altogether, but that little 
pocket was not liberated. Hitler already had 
co mmitted suicide, and we were still under 
occupation. The entire cun -- The entire con
tinent of Europe was 
liberated, except -- I 
mean, I™m only talking 
about days now, that little part of
 Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and ha 
-- and -- and -- and -- and The Hague, were st
ill under German occupa
tion for a couple of 
days after Hitler had committed suicide, So we
 were the very last one, and that™s why 
there was no food, period. 
Q: Because there was no transport allowed through? 
A: I can™t tell you th e reason wh y, all I know is  we were absolutely
 starving, starving. 
And so, I know what hunger is. I would wa
ke up in th e middle of the night -- in the 
middle of the night, I would wake up and -- 
and -- and jump  up in bed, because why? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
14
 
 
 
 
Because I saw a piece of bread in my dream, a
nd that gave me a complete nightmare. So, 
you know. 
Q: Well, I™m going to turn
 over to -- to side B -- 
A: Ok -- 
Q: -- to talk about liberation. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: So I™d -- I™d really -- I-I know that I was ve
ry touched by your word
s, ﬁI didn™t cry for 
five years during the war, but wh en I saw Jewish boys, with Jewish stars on Canadian 
uniforms,ﬂ -- 
A: Well let me -- we w ere -- we were liber
ated not by the American army, but by the 
Canadian army. Attached to th
e Canadian army, was a small 
de -- brigad e, or whatever 
you want to call it, of the Jewish brigade. 
We were -- Now, after having been inside a 
room for tw o and a half years, and th at does 
not include the time we 
spent on the farm, so 
we were finally liberated -- 

Q: How did you find out? 
A: You knew it, you knew it. People were al
l of a sudden, you kn
ow, shouting and -- and 
-- and -- and -- and -- and -- I mean, there was 
just joy all over, so you knew you could 
leave. And I would leave with my mother, and tr
uthfully, we didn™t ba -- we really didn™t 
even know where to go. We 
were just walking, and -- and all of a sudden, we saw a 
Canadian soldier. And I can™t te
ll you the feeling that we ha
d, after having been  under 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
15
 
 
 
 
German occupation, all you saw were Nazi so
ldiers, swastikas flying all over the place, 
and all of a sudden, for the firs
t time in five years, we see an
 allied soldier in uniform. I -- 
I don™t think I can describe it, there is no way 
that I can describe the feeling. And as we 
got closer to this Canadian sold ier, I happe
ned to see -- so I -- I went over there, and 
wanted to shake hands 
with him, when I saw a -- on his sl
eeve, the word Je
wish brigade, 
with the Jewish star. Now, if you think -- I me
an, we were so enthralled by the fact that 
we saw a -- an allied soldier, 
but then, to see a Jewish so
ldier in a -- in a Canadian 
uniform with the -- with the Jewi
sh star, after five years of sw
astikas, I -- it -- 
it -- it just -
- you -- I can™t describe it. And as I -- as you ju
st said before, after having lost my  father, 
after having lost my brother, or it™s in -- in re
verse order, I might say, in order to keep  my  
mother, you know, I never cried. But when 
I saw that Je wish so
ldier, I just -- I -- I 
couldn™t -- I -- I just broke down. I was in tears,
 absolutely in tears. 
So that was the first 
day of liberation. And -- And th
en, we -- we had to look for a place to live. Now, we still 
-- we had a little money, whic
h we didn™t have on us, but there was a -- one of our 
neighbors, a very lovely, elde
rly lady, she had some of our money, that we gave her the 

day then  wh en we left our 
ap artment in Amsterdam, in 1941. And -- And every penny 
that we gave her was still there, w h ich in its
elf is unusual. And we finally rented  a room, 

not an ap artment, just a room, in the old neig hborhood I might say. 

Q: Do you remember 
how much it cost? 
A: I haven™t got the foggiest notion. And we -- 
we stayed there, my mother and I, in one 
room. Well, we were used to that by now, 
after two and a half years. And about four

weeks later, there was a knoc
k on the door, and Dutch polic
e knocked on the door, are 
you, you know, at that time my
 first name w as Gerd, not Gerald, or Gerry, as it is now. 
ﬁAre you Gerd von Halle?ﬂ I said yes. ﬁIs 
-- Are you Henrietta von Halle?ﬂ Yes. ﬁYou™re 
arrested.ﬂ We were arrested again four week
s, or six weeks -- four weeks I would say, 
after liberation. Why were we arrested? The Du
tch police, after liberation, went back to 
the old files that they had, and when we ca
me to Amsterdam in 1933, we were German 
citizens, an d therefore, we were registered 
as Germans. And when 
the Dutch  police after 
the war, wanted to round up all 
the Germans, they we
nt back to th eir old files, and lo and 
behold, there are two more Germans, the von Halle
s. And so  they arrest
ed us, took us to a 
school where they had put all Nazis. And 
here, I can™t -- I mean, I don™t know wh ether 
you can picture that, but here we are in -- in
 -- in -- in the -- in a big room with all 
German Nazis. Well, thank goodness, after ab
out six, eight, nine hours of telling -- you 
know, negotiating with -- with the police in 
-- or not negotiating, there was nothing to  
negotiate, I was just telling them who we we
re, and that we were not -- you know, we 
were Jews, and so they let us
 go. But that was just a -- 
Q: Did you recognize any specific people -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- in the Nazis? 

A: No. 
Q: Did you have any kind 
of interchange or dialog conversation with them? 
A: Darn -- Darn tootin™, no.

Q: Were you frightened? 
A: Well, I wouldn™t call it frightened, no. I d
on™t think we were frightened. We were -- It 
was a terrib le, terrible feeling to be in r
oom with basically, with
 your family™s ex -
executioners. I mean, I -- I™m not 
saying that these people in 
that room were -- executed 
my  father and my  brother, but th
ey were part of the same -- 
Q: And how did you co nvin
ce them you were Jewish? 
A: Well, that™s a good question, I forgot. I did th
e -- I did the talking. I don™t -- I -- I -- I -- 
I really don™t know, it™s -- it™s mo re than 50 years ago, I don™t -- I don™t remember what I 

did, but -- 
Q: I™ve heard this story befo re, that happened to people on -- upon liberation, the Jews 
were taken in -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- you know, until th
ey could prove -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that they were Jewish. [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t know how I proved it, bu
t I don™t think it was that difficult. 
Q: So you then -- How 
soon after -- What -- What was your
 life like between this point of 
the apartment, you returned b
ack to the apartment with your mother, and the time that 
you went to America,
 what was that like? 
A: Well, I loved -- I loved Amsterdam. That 
was -- you know, I grew up there, and I -- I 
loved to spend time there, but I also realized
 that my future was lying in America. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

we had, if the war, incidentally, had broken 
out maybe two months later, we would have 
been in America, because our
 -- our quota number was due. We just missed it by -- by -- 
by -- by a month or two. 
Q: So you had applied long befo re -- 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, except the German quot
a was -- was terribly over -- oversubscribed, 
so to speak. 

Q: Did you apply wh en 
your father was alive? 
A: Oh yes. That was -- We applied before th
e war, and -- but, you know, as I said, if -- if 
the war had broken out two months later, we 
would have been in Am
erica. It d idn™t turn 
out that way. And what did I do? Well, my  am
bition -- I always wanted to be a dentist. 
Now, obviously, I didn™t have the educationa
l background, because five years of ma -- 

you know, from age -- the war broke out in
 40 -- from -- from age 
18 to age 23, I was 
under German occupation. And so, those ar
e the years when your 
education really -- 
where you get your education. 
And I only had one year that
 -- it was even under German 
occupation, I had one year of that college. 
Thank goodness, because that™s where I me t 
my -- my savior, th-the -- the teacher who 
saved our lives. And so -- so what I did, 
because obviously I couldn™t go to dental co
llege, I didn™t have the background, I didn™t 
have the -- the original backgrou
nd for -- for colle -- for dental college, I went to a dental 
laboratory, and although that 
took a few months til I got that
 lined up. And 
then when I 
came to America, well, then I ca
me -- basically I came on a ship.

Q: Wait -- What -- Now, how di
d you decide to go and your
 mother to stay, and how 
much time was there in betw
een liberation and your -- 
A: My leaving? The liberation took place in Ma
y of 1945, and I left
 for America in the 
end of October. So -- 
Q: And how -- Did you have fami ly in 
the United States that helped you? 
A: Well, helped me is -- is the wrong word  
to use. They  -- I had two uncles here in the 
United States, and -- 
Q: Mother™s? 

A: My mother™s brothers. And 
they lived in -- in 
-- in the United States. So I came on a 
troop carrier. When I say a troop carrier, this
 was a tr -- a troop carrier of the Dutch 
Merchant Marine. The -- The d -- The Du tch 
Merchant Marine was just about wiped out 
during th e war, and they -- the -- the Dutch 
govern ment bought -- I don™t know whether 
they bought it or were given, 
liberty ships. And so these lib
erty ships wer-were supposed 
to be brought back to Holla
nd, and so they  had a troop 
carrier, with Dutch Merchant 
Marine sailors, who came to the United States, 
to pick up these ships,
 to take them back 
to Holland. And I was the only 
civilian on that -- on that troo
p carrier. And if you ask me 
how I got onto that troop carrier, 
I haven™t got the foggiest notion. 
Q: Was it difficult to say goodbye to your mother? 

A: Yes, like -- Well, she -- I knew she would -- she would come, too, so it™s not a matter 
that I wasn™t going to see her. You know, I 
-- She came about six, seven months later. 
Q: Why did she wait? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
20
 
 
 
 
A: Because this troop carrier was -- was only 
men, there was no ro om for women, and so  
she couldn™t. And sh e finally came on a -- on -- by plane. 
Q: What were your expectations when  you got 
on that carrier, of what America would be 
like, and wh at you might be able to do? 
A: Well, like every foreigner, America -- America™s th e land that is -- where the streets 
are lined with gold. Now, the reality of co
urse, is completely di
fferent. But everybody 
thought America is, y ou know, 
that™s the land where you want
 to be. I -- I had heard a 
great deal about America, and I -- I had made
 u p  my  mind  th at wh
en I came -- when I 
come to America, I wanted to 
be an American. I didn™t want for the rest of my life to be 
the refugee who can™t speak th
e language, or -- or who speaks it with a very heavy 
accent. The -- The one thing that
 I wanted more than anythi
ng else, I wanted to be 
American. I wanted to be lo
oked upon as an American. 
I wanted to speak like an 
American, I wanted to act like an American, 
and that was -- so wh
en I came to this 
country, I paid special atten
tion to how people speak, and -- 
Q: Before we go too mu ch further into Amer
ica, you first started out in a refugee center. 
And wh at was that [indecipherable] 

A: Well, no, this came here mo -- in other wo
rds, when I arrived in
 the United States, I 
arrived in Hoboken, the ship
 landed in Ho boken. And th
ere was the Steven -- Steven 
Weiss, Rabbi Steven  Weiss had a refugee ce -- 
had a -- had a Temp le on th e west side of 
-- on Central Park West, and he had a refuge
e center, I believe it was somewhere around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
21
 
 
 
 
67
th
 Street, or 69
th
 Street, on -- near -- near Central Pa
rk West, in New York. And, so I 
went directly from the ship 
to the refugee center, and -- 
Q: Was there someone to greet you? 
A: At the refugee center? 

Q: At the ship, or [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, at the ship, my -- one of my uncles 
picked me up and took me to the refugee 
center. 
Q: He lived in New York? 

A: He lived in New York. 
Q: But he couldn™t put you up? 
A: That™s a hard question to answer. I -- I know
 he didn™t, whether he
 could have, that™s a 
different -- that™s a different question. 
Q: But you don™t recollect 
any feelings about that? 
A: No, not really. I was so -- I 
was so elated to be in Amer
ica, that that never really 
entered my mind. So I -- So I arrived there,
 and -- and I -- and the f -- one of the first 
things -- there are two things that struck me 
when I arrived in the 
United States. The first 
thing was, when  I arrived in Ho boken, oh my  
God, it was -- there was 
so much dirt on the 
street. And coming from Holland, where they
 -- where they -- wh
ere they wash the 
sidewalks -- not any more, not today, but I™m ta
lking about in the -- in
 the 40™s, th-they -- 
they -- they washed the sidewa
lks, and here I come to America, and -- and -- and -- and 
the dirt is all over the place. I -- That struck
 me as strange. And th
e second th ing, when  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
22
 
 
 
 
got to the refugee center, there was a radio,
 and I had never hear
d  a co mmercia l  in  my  
life. In -- In  -- In Holland, yo
u pay for the priv ilege of liste
ning to  radio, and there are no 
commercials, only in America. And here you hear
 that beautiful music, and then all of a 
sudden you hear 
about the -- the milk commercial, a
nd the -- and the -- and the -- and -- 
and the McDonald™s, or maybe 
McDonald™s wasn™t around at that time, but whatever 
commercials they had. And that struck me as ve
ry strange. I had to ge
t used to that, every 
-- every five minutes, a commercial.  
Q: You mentioned music, do you reme mb er
 what kind of mu sic you listened to? 
A: Well, we -- we were, as teenagers in Holla
nd, we listened to jazz
. That was my -- That 
was my  thing. My  parents listened to Beethov
en, and we listened to Cab Calloway, and -- 
and -- and -- and -- and you know, all the other people. 

Q: Big band? 
A: Big band. Oh  yes, 
oh yes, we, you know. 
Q: Did you get -- There -- There was such a di
fferent feeling actually, in America, the 
stories of, you know, dancing, an d big bands,
 live performances, and did you get any of 
that when you came over? Did you have an
 opportunity  to go to any dances, or -- 
A: I couldn™t afford it. I couldn™t afford it, 
but that doesn™t mean I -- I couldn™t listen to 

the radio, I -- I -- you know, one of the first 
things I got was a radio. Television, of 
course, came later. And so  I listened -- I liste
ned to th e big bands, and I loved it, you 
know.  

Q: And who was president at that time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
23
 
 
 
 
A: President was Harry Truman. Harry Trum
an, the -- probably 
one of the greatest 
presidents this country ever had. 
Q: Why do you feel that 
way about Harry Truman? 
A: Harry Truman, because Harry Truman, I be
lieve, if I am not mistaken, was -- was the 
president who had a -- a sign on his desk wh
ich said, the buck stops here. And that™s -- 
Harry Truman, if he saw it as 
-- as yellow, he called it y ellow, and if it was black, he 
called it black, and if it was white, he calle
d it white, and there was no fudging between 
black and white, it was just the way he saw it, 
and that™s the way he™s -- did it. I -- I -- 

Although, at the time,  wh
en he was president, I wasn™t t h
at impressed with him, but each 
year that goes by, and that™s why I said, I th
ink he was one of the greatest presidents this 
country has ever had. 

Q: Because he was straightforward? 
A: He was straightforw ard, and he was just honest. 
Q: Now I know that in your interview at 
the mu seum, you said your first job was at 
Gimb el™s, and I -- and I hear you again today 
saying that you wanted to beco me a real 
American more than anything else. What
 do you mean, or did you mean by real 
American? 
A: Well, America, to me, at that time, st
ood for everything th at™s good in  the wo rld. I 
mean, here is a country that -- maybe too late 
for -- for my family, but came to the rescue 
of -- of Europe. They  could have, if they ha
d wanted to , they could have been -- stayed 
out of the war, and here they 
-- they -- they liberated Europe
, they liber -- liberated the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
24
 
 
 
 
the Far East. There ma y have been  some self in
terest in this, but the fact of the matter is, 
this was the country that stood fo
r everything that I believed in. 
Q: Do you still feel this in 
retrospect, or in looking at -- 
to see -- have you ever been 
angry or wo rried about the fact that Am
erica waited as it did, to liberate? 
A: No. I -- I™ll tell you what I was angry about with America, and -- you see, Mr. 
Roosevelt, I know he was a great friend of 
th e Jews, the Jews thought he was -- he was 
next -- sitting next to God. I 
never felt that w ay, and the reason why I didn™t feel that 
way, is because Mr. Roosevelt could have, 
very easily, bombed the -- the -- the railroad 
tracks leading to  Au schwitz and other concen
tration camps. He could have bomb ed the 
ovens and the gas chambers very easily. And 
I certainly don™t want anybody to tell me, 
ﬁYeah, but if he had done that
, he might have killed innocent 
people in the camp.ﬂ That 
does not hold water with me, for good reasons, and I don't -- 
Q: What is the reason? 
A: Well, the reason is, these people were 
on their way to the -- to -- to -- to a gas 
chamber, and if they  could -- if Mr. Roosev
elt could have bombed 
those gas chambers, 
and if he had to do it twice or three times, a
nd over again if they re
built it, so be it. So, 
my anger, if I have any, is not -- is certa
inly not with America, but it™s with Mr. 
Roosevelt. And that™s why I -- wh-when Mr. Tr
uman came along, he was such a breath of 
fresh air, you know. 
Q: So, how was it that your mo ther came by plane? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
25
 
 
 
 
A: Well, there were -- I mean, this was not
 like today where -- where you have dozen s 
and dozen s of planes landing from -- from 
-- from -- from Holland, 
and then any other 
country, but there were some planes, and sh
e was one of them -- she was on one of them. 
Q: How did she get the money, or
 did she have it [indecipherable] 
A: Haven™t got the fo ggiest notion.  
Q: Maybe from the money that -- 
A: I don™t -- I don™t -- I don™t rememb er. 

Q: -- the neighbor saved? 

A: Yeah, yeah. My wife thinks that she got 
it from her brothers and 
then she paid it back 
to them. I -- That -- That ma
y be so, and it ma y not be so. 
Q: Were you there to meet her? 

A: Oh, sure. Oh, sure. 
Q: Did you have any recollection of that mo ment, or -- 
A: No, it™s really -- it wasn™t that dramatic
. Y ou know, it™s like -- like a -- a child going 

off to college and doesn™t see their parents 
for six months, so wh
en  th ey  co me b a ck , 
they™re very  happy to see their parents, but
 it™s not that, my  goodness, you know, it™s not 
something th at would have a lasting impression on you. 

Q: So, by th e time she arrived, did you ha
ve a place to live and a job, and -- 
A: Well, let me t -- Would you like to hear 
the -- the day one, day one in America? So, 
here I arrived in the -- in Rabbi Weiss™s ref
ugee center, and now I was 
told, before I came 
to hol -- before I came to America, that the th
ing you have to do, if 
you want to get a job 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
26
 
 
 
 
in America, you have to buy the New York  Time
s. And, so I arrived, I had five dollars in 
my  pocket, and I arrived at that refugee center
, went to sleep the -- that night, woke up 
the next morning, and now I needed a j
ob, and I needed a job in a hurry. So, I 
remembered the New York Times, and I 
walked down from wh
erever it was, 67
th
 Street, 
on Central Park West, I walked 
down Central Park West to 59
th
 Street, and there was, and 
still is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a 
-- a newsstand. It™s still 
there. And I went to 
ask the man for the New York t -- oh, I saw th
e New York Times lying there, and it was a 
nickel. So I put down a nickel, and now I was 
down to four dollars and 95 cents. And I 
took the newspaper and I went into  Central Park
, and I want to sit on 
a bench, and first of 
all, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn™t belie
ve it, the New York 
Times came in -- in 
four, five, six sections. When I left Holla
nd, in those days, right after the war, the 
newspaper was one page. That was the newspa
per. And here I come to New York, and -- 
and I mean it was two inches thick. And so
 I took it into Central Park, sat down on a 
bench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just
 to find out in what section of the New 
York  Times, do I find the wanted  ads, the em
ployment ads. And -- And finally I -- I did 
find it. Now, of course, I spoke very, very little
 English, just a year or two what I had 
learned in school. And -- And I tried to read
 it, and I couldn™t find it because -- or I 

couldn™t read it because everything was abbr
eviated. APRX, now what does that stand 
for? Approximately? I mean, you know, I had no
 idea. And so I said to my self, let me go 
to the next bench, there was a 
man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I 
said, ﬁI wonder wh ether you can help me?ﬂ An
d wh at do you think he said? He says, ﬁI 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
27
 
 
 
 
not speak English.ﬂ So  -- So I was mo re or le
ss forced to do it on my own, and I saw an 
ad by Gimbel™s on 34
th
 Street, they are no longer there to
day, but in those days Gimb el™s 
was down on 34
th
 Street. I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a 
real New York woman, a l -- I was going to sa
y a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she 
was a woman who said, ﬁWhat do you want?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁWell, I™m looking for a job.ﬂ 
ﬁWell, we have -- we™re looking fo r ri,ﬂ -- th is was just before Christmas, they were 
looking for Christmas help. ﬁW
e have a -- We have -- We™re looking for wrap pers.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁOh good, that™s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.ﬂ I wa
nted to be a wrapper 
in -- in America. So I got a job. So they
 took me and put me in the -- in the toy 
department, and I™m wrapping toys like crazy,and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I™m -- 

I™m handling a huge doll, which was made out 
of porcelain. In those days, plastic wasn™t 
that popular. And I dropped it on th e floor in
 5,000,000 pieces and the superv isor -- su-
supervisor was coming -- running over, and he
 says, ﬁYou can™t work here. Go up to th e 
11
th
 floor, the rug department.ﬂ So I was 
in the rug department, wrapping rugs.  
Q: Hold  on, [inaudible]. Let™s go to the next tape. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape two, side A, of an inte
rview with Gerry von Ha
lle, conducted by Ginger 
Miles, on July 10
th
, 1999, for the United States Holoca
ust Memorial Museum. This is a 
follow up interview of a Unite
d States Holocaust Memo rial Museum video interview, 
conducted in 1990. The United States Ho
locaust Memo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for 
making this interview possible. 

A: So, here I am in the toy department of Gi
mbel™s, and then I learned my first lesson in 
America. C h ristmas came and 
went, and I™m picking up my  pa
ycheck, and what is in the 
paycheck? A pink slip. It says, ﬁYour services are no longer needed . Thank you very 
mu ch, and here is your check.ﬂ Well, after -- 
after maybe a month or two in America, I™m 
unemp loyed, and I -- you know, I -- there was no 
Social Security af -- as far as I was 
concerned, and so I had to do 
some fast working, and I, by luck, my  uncle had a dentist, 
and I wanted to go into the dental laboratory 
business, because that™s as close to being a 
dentist as you can get. An
d he got me a job on 41
st
 Street, in the Herald-Tribune building, 
and there I got a job doing basically, at th
e bottom of the ladder, pouring casts. And I 
wanted to -- I really wanted to advance myse
lf, and I was held back in that laboratory. 
And after about six months or so
 working in that la
b, I -- I realized that I would never 
advance there, and I wanted to learn the busi
ness, and learn it in a hurry, so there was, 
again thro ugh co nnections, I found a laborator
y, a one man lab, and I told him what I 
wanted, and he says, ﬁI™ll tell you what. I™ll 
let you wo rk for me, if you pay me.ﬂ Instead 
of him paying me, I had to 
pay him, and I was willing to
 do that. I had saved -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
29
 
 
 
 
know, I worked at Gimbel™s for two months
, and -- and the -- and th e dental laboratory 
for six mo nths, and so I -- you know, I had 
saved a couple of dollars. So I was -- I 
actually paid him for the privilege of workin
g for him. But I learned a great deal, and I 
th en  op en ed  up
 my  own dental lab, on -- 
Q: After how long in  America? 
A: I would say probably  the whole -- the -- a
bout a year and a half, or maybe two years, 
or something like that. 
Q: Before we go into
 this career that you -- you manage
d so quickly, wh en your mo ther 
came to America, did you and she 
have an apartment together?  
A: Yes, 236 East 82
nd
 Street. We had -- Actually, we 
had a -- we had two rooms, tiny, 
tiny, tiny, little rooms, one was a bedroom that
 just was big enough 
to hold a b -- a -- a 
bed, and a living room which had a couch an
d a -- and -- and a table, you know, and so 
on. And so my  mo ther would sl
eep in the bed, and I wo uld 
sleep on the couch, and -- and 
-- 

Q: Did she work ? 

A: She got a job almo st immediately, throug
h a pediatrician which my  uncle knew, she 
got a job as a baby nurse. Her very first j
ob was in Cedarhurst, Long Island, I remember, 
and people loved her. She ha 
-- She was a lovely, lovely pe
rson, and a fabulous, fabulous 
baby nurse. And so this doctor, who 
recommended her, this pediatrician who 
recommended her to these people, when  she was fi
nished with that job, he had jobs lined 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
30
 
 
 
 
up for her, one after another. So she hardly ever
 was at -- in the h
ouse, because she lived, 
obviously, with the people wh
ere she was the baby nurse. 
Q: How did you communicate with each other? 
A: By telephone. And, you kn
ow, I would, on -- on Su ndays I 
would, if -- if I could get 
there, I didn™t have a car, obviously, 
you know, if I could get there by -- 
Q: Would this have b
een 1946, this time? 
A: I would say it probably was 
1940 -- yeah , the end of ™46, 
probably , yeah
, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Did you meet other people who -- other survivors? 

A: Yes, yes, indeed I did. Some of my -- 
I made friends here. I met one couple who were 
neighbors of mine, next door neighbor
s from Hamburg, not from Amsterdam, from 
Hamburg, where I was born. And so I became 
friends with them, and through them, you 
know, and of course, all my friends were
 -- w ere -- were refugees, and -- and -- 
Q: Did you -- I know you -- you were first in 
a refugee center that was started by a rabbi. 
Did you -- 

A: Yeah, Rabbi Weiss, Steven Weiss, yeah. 

Q: Did you -- Did you go to  Synagogue? 
A: I, to be very honest with
 you, my mother ca
me from a very religious home. Excuse 
me. She came from a -- you know, a home where 
they kept kosher and so on. My father 
didn™t know how to spell th
e word Jewish, although he 
w -- you know, h-he -- he was 
Jewish, and -- and -- and -- and been Jewish 
for -- you know, I have a family tree that 
goes back  over 300 years, al --
 all the von Halles, and -- and 
they were all Jewish. But he

didn™t -- didn™t observe anything,
 and so I didn™t. I wasn™t 
trained in -- you know, even 
though I was Bar Mitzvahed, it was sort of by rote. 
Q: So when you came to America then, re
ligious life, or community was not -- 
A: Was not important, not important to me at
 that time, n o t til -- until after I got married, 
which I™ll talk about. 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: So -- So then I -- I -- I formed 
my  own dental laboratory, and I ru -- 
Q: Where did you find the money? 

A: Well, first of all, I did it with a -- I did it 
with a partner there, one of the people that I 
met in that first dental lab, 
where they wouldn™t let me ad va
nce, there was a ma n who, he 
was American, he -- he and I went in -- in
 business together. The -- The name of the 
dental lab was von Halle - Geiger Dental
 Lab, on Eighth Ave
nue. That building on 
Eighth Avenue is no longer th
ere, there is a motel there now
, or whatever. And so we -- 
we were -- we were operating that lab, mo
stly I was operating it, he -- he was a smart 
boy, he -- he kept his -- he kept his job an
d did this on the side. But it worked out all 
right. But I -- After a couple of years, I realiz
ed that I could always make a good living in 
a dental laboratory business, but the money is 
really on the side of the dentist. He makes 

the money and the laboratory is -- just makes a 
living. And so  I realized that if I wanted 

to advance in  America, and make, quote, m
oney, that was the wrong business, at least 
the way I saw it. And so one day -- well, let me
 actually  -- let me --
 when I started the 
laboratory busin ess, I was single, but then  I -- 
these people -- these friends of mine that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

lived next to me in Hamburg, came up to me
 one day, and said to me, ﬁGerry, how would 
you like to have a blind date?ﬂ A blind date
. And I thought about it for a minute, and I 
said to them, ﬁI tell y ou quite
 frankly, I would prefer somebody who can see.ﬂ So -- So  I -
- So they -- So I went on that blind date, an
d I came home that night -- we went out -- I -- 
I think we went out to Yonkers, New York 
for -- for -- for a place to eat, and I came 
home that night and I said to my self, ﬁI thinkI™m going to marry that girl.ﬂ I took her out 

a second time, and -- 

Q: What did you do wh
en you went out to -- 
A: We went out, the four of us. W-We had 
dinner in Yonkers, and -- and -- and that was 
it, and -- and they had a car, I didn™t have a ca
r. So they drove us back and forth and, you 
know, dropped me off. And second time I took he
r out, I called my mother after that, and 
I said, ﬁI met a girl and I think I™m going 
to marry her.ﬂ And her comment was, ﬁYes, 
yes, yes, yes. I -- I have heard that before
.ﬂ And I took her out seven times, and we got 
engaged, and th at™s my wife of 47 years. 

Q: Wow. 

A: I don™t know how much longer she™s goi
ng to keep me, but for 47 years it™s b een -- 
Q: And what is her full name, 
or befo -- before she married? 

A: Her name -- That™s funny that you™re 
asking a question like th at, because her name 
was Gerda -- I -- her name is -- is Gerda, sa
me as my name. G -- M y  name was G-e-r-d, 
her name is G-e-r-d-a, so there™s Gerd and 
Gerda, except I changed my name when I 
came to the United States, when 
I took my citizenship™s [ind
ecipherable]. I just added -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
33
 
 
 
 
but -- Gerd, I added a - l in between, so that 
made it Gerald. And her name is Gerda, and 
her maiden name was Freudenberg. Now, I™
ll just tell you one little funny story there. 
When  I got engaged, one of my  friends calle
d me up and said to me, ﬁGee, Gerry, I hear 
you got engaged.ﬂ I said yes. ﬁWell, congrat
ulations, what™s her name?ﬂ ﬁHer name is 
Gerda.ﬂ ﬁWhat™s her last name?ﬂ And for the lif
e of me, I could not reme mb er that name 
Freudenberg. I could think of 
Schwartz, and Levy, and Cohen, 
an d I could think of all the 
Jewish names, but Freudenb
erg, I could not, for a  
millio n years could -- could I 
remember it. So anyhow, that
™s just an -- an aside.  
Q: Now you said that your religio
us life changed during this time. 
A: Well, my religious life cha
nged because my wife, 
although my in-laws were really not 
r -- that religious either, but my  wife was.
 Not that -- you know, sh
e was -- she went to 
Sunday school, and you know, to
 Friday night services w ith
 her grandmother and so on, 
not necessarily with her parents. And so , basi
cally, when we got married, and then -- and 
then later on, the children came along, we -- 
we made sure, that is my wife made sure, 
and I followed, and -- and now 
we™re Temple members -- we™re Temple goers. Last night 
I was at a T emple, and we™re -- we™re -- we™re 
-- we™ve been members of this Temple for 
36 years, and we™re regular Te
mple me m -- T e mp le g oers.  
Q: Has this been an important part of your life? 
A: Yes. It has been an important part of 
my  life, and I™ll tell you why. When -- When  -- 
During the war, when I lost my brother, who 
was my very, very best friend, and was a 
tragic thing, I -- I -- I can™t ev
en start to tell y ou. And then 
later on I lost my father. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
34
 
 
 
 
then we -- And here we™re in hiding, nobo
dy can help us. As a Jew  in occ -- under 
occupation, you can™t pick up
 the phone and dial 911, an
d have the police come and 
rescue you. 91 -- 911 were the Nazis at that 
point. And so, here you 
are, desperate, and 
every day you didn™t know wh ether you wo uld liv
e another day. I all of a sudden realized 
there™s only one person who -- who can probably help  -- possibly help me, and that™s 
God. So I prayed to God, in 
whatever language it was, an d so I became -- God, I -- I bel -
- I sh -- believed in Go
d, the first time I ever thought of
 God. And so  when -- when I got 
married, and my  wife wa-wanted to take us 
to -- to Temp le, it wasn™t -- you know, I was 
perfectly willing to go. 

Q: You™d been preparing fo
r that for a long time? 
A: Yeah. I mean, I didn™t -- I -- I-I couldn™t
 speak he -- I couldn™t read Hebrew or 
anything like that, but I -- I -- I was -- I wa
s Jewish, I fe lt Jewish
, I -- you know, like -- 
Q: Did you learn Hebrew? 
A: Y -- My wife does. My Hebrew I don™t want 
to brag about. It™s -- It™s not too good.  
Q: Speaking of your -- your 
pray ing, and your awareness of -- of a higher bein g, I -- 
when I heard your story, there were certain tim
es when it almost seem
ed as if luck, or 
else a supreme being was l
ooking over you and your mo ther. 
For instance, when  -- when  
she hid in the closet -- 

A: That™s right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
35
 
 
 
 
Q: -- and the put the suitc -- they looked in
 every closet, but that one, and then  you 
moved her under the bed, and th ey  were stack
ing everything on top, and she was right 
there. 
A: Right. 

Q: Have you thought about th-the
 role of luck, or God, in -- 
A: Well, at that pa -- very particular poi
nt when this happened
, you don™t think of 
anything, you™re just thinking of -- of 
how do I -- you know, how do 
I save her, how do I 
save myself. My father already was arrested . You don™t think in those terms. L ater on, 

when you have time to reflect upo
n it, that™s when you start th
inking in terms, not when it 
happens. 

Q: And have you thought of -- 
had time to think about that? 
A: I think ab out it -- if I tell you that there is 
hardly a day that goes by that I don™t think 
about my  brother, because he was my  best fri
end, and there™s hardly a day th at goes by 
where I don™t think of him. My father, too,
 but I -- I was closest to my brother. You 
know, ma - - obviously I th
ink of my  father, too. 
Q: Plus his -- the brother™s death seemed so -- 
A: Oh, it was a -- i-it was the mo st gruesome, 
I don™t ev en want to go into  it. It was the 
mo st gruesome, gruesome way th
at anybody could die. It -- It
 -- you know, it™s one thing 
to be sh -- you know, to have a shot -- be sh
ot, I mean, which is not exactly nice, either, 
but the way they -- he was in 
-- in -- in Mauthausen concentr
ation camp  in Austria, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
36
 
 
 
 
that was about, I think, about the worst of
 all of them, if th -- if you can make a 
distinction between concentration 
camps, which you really can™t.  
Q: Does your -- When you think 
about your brother, does your 
sense of justice, or your 
attitude toward certain political events that 
have occurred in this country, and in the 
world, do you th ink that experience has an 
effect on your response to current ev ents? 
A: I must assume it has. I m
ean, I -- I™m not aware of it, but
 I-I™m sure, anything that you 
live through has a-an affect on -- on -- on 
your outlook, and -- an
d on your attitude.  
Q: What year was it 
that you got married? 
A: 19 -- I should -- na -- ™51. 
Q: ™51, uh-huh. 
A: 1951. 

Q: So, now that was -- 
A: Six -- And which -- that was about -- th
at was about five years after I came. 
Q: And that was also when -- 
A: Or -- Or six years. 

Q: -- when Joseph McCarthy began his no
torious McCarthy hearings. Do you -- 
A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: Did you relate to those hear
ings at all, or watch them? 
A: Oh yes, I watched -- I watched every day, 
and I was absolutely furious at his tacti cs.  
Q: Not frightened? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
37
 
 
 
 
A: No, not frightened. After all, yo -- Well, fr-fri
ghtened in -- in a -- in
 a -- in a different 
sense. I was frightened for -- for America, not
 for myself. I was fri
ghtened for America, 
until -- and I was disappointed, I might say, 
in ma -- in Mr. Eisenhower, President 
Eisenhower. I thought, as president, he coul
d have done mu ch mo re
 than he did. Harry 
Truman would not have allowed 
this to go on, I can a -- I ca
n assure you. Eisenhower, in 
that respect -- ah, he was not a bad president,
 but in th at respect he was wishy-washy. 
And I was not happy about that. And so -- 
Q: We haven™t discussed -- I haven™t heard mu ch
 about your relationship with the rest of 

your family, say like when you got married
, did your uncles come to your wedding? 
A: Yes, they -- I have to -- I have to think 
for a minute. The answer 
is no. The answer is 
no. 

Q: So, were they living 
right in New York City? 
A: At that point, no. One 
was living in California. 
Q: Oh. 

A: And the other one was 
living in South Carolina. 
Q: Had they left -- 
A: Or in Florida. 
A2: Florida and -- and North Carolina. 

A: Fine, okay. 
Q: Had they left much earlier from Germany, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
38
 
 
 
 
A: Germany? Yeah, they left in 19 -- they
 -- they left about 1937. One -- On e was a 
doctor, and the other one was a lawyer.  
Q: So I know that education had -- is 
 a regret, that you have mentioned. 
A: Indeed. 
Q: Is that still true? 
A: Oh yes, yeah -- well, is it still true? At
 -- At this point, don™t fo rget, I am what, 76. 
You -- You don™t think that much about educ
ation any mo re. But oh 
yes, obviously, it ha 
-- it had an impact on me, because if I had th
e education, I probably would be a dentist. 
Not that I would have, you know -- 

Q: And after you got married, did you chan
ge your occu pation, or your business? 
A: Yes, I did, I did. As a matter of fa
ct, one day, and I™ll te
ll you how I changed my  
occupation. It was -- I told you that I could 
always make a -- a living, and maybe even a 
good living in a -- in the dental laboratory fiel
d, but to make money, I realized that I was 
in the wrong profession. And so one day, my
 wife and I, we lived in a -- in -- in New 
York City at that time,
 in a fourth  floor walk -up. We 
went to a party wh ere there were 
five couples, in -- plus us. And we were 
the only ones that came by subway  because I 
didn™t have a car. All the others came by ca
r. And I came home that night, and I sat down 
wh -- and I talked to my wife about that, a
nd I said, ﬁYou know, it™s strange. All of these 

people can afford a car, I can™t 
afford a car.ﬂ And then I star
ted to realize why they could 
afford a car. They were, all of them, were in 
the sales field. All of them. Different sales 
field, you know. And so  wh at did I do? The ne
xt morning, on a Sund
ay morning, I get up, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
39
 
 
 
 
I get the New York Times again, and I™m look
ing sales. Zillions, an
d I mean zillions of 
ads for sales help, and so on. 
And there were a couple of ad
s I cut out, and one of them 
happened to be with an inve
stment firm in Wall Street, a
nd -- who were willing to train 
and then  employ you. And so I went there, 
and th ey accepted me, and th ey trained me, 
and then  you had to make sales. Well, that 
was very, very difficult. That was a different 
field. Now, you™re dealing st
rictly with American public, and it™s you, by yourself, and 

you know. So -- 

Q: And your language by th is time? 

A: And the language, well, my  
language, I -- I -- I 
mentioned to you in the beginning, th is 
was one of the key th ings for me. I wanted 
to speak English like an
 -- like an American, 
not like -- not like Mr. Kissinger who, after 
60 years, still can™t sp
eak proper English, 
although he™s -- he is probably th -- one of 
th e brightest people, an
d one of the people I 
respect very, very much. But I didn™t want to
 sound like Mr. Kissinger, and so I -- I paid 
a lot of attention to -- to the language, and I 
-- you know. So, I worked for the investment 
firm, and it got to the point, 
after a couple of months, wh
ere I just didn™t have any -- 
you™re not -- I was not on a salary, I was on 
commissions, and it almo st got to the point 
where I felt I had to leave the business. So, in
 that -- in the meantime, we are no longer 
living in  -- in New York , we 
were living in  Teaneck. We 
had bought a house for 19,000 
dollars, or 21,000 dollars, a
nd I didn™t have the down  payment, so I borro wed 2,000 
dollars from my mother and 2,000 dollars from
 my mother-in-law, and that™s how we bill 
-- bought the house in Teaneck, New Jersey, 
and so, after business really -- I th ought I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
40
 
 
 
 
had to quit, I started, in the basement of th
is house in Teaneck, I bu
ilt -- started to build a 
laboratory, the physical parts 
of a laboratory, with the benc
hes and all of that. And th en 
one day -- 
Q: Like a dental lab? 

A: Back -- Back into the dental
 lab. I had to  make a living,
 you know. So , then  one day, 
or one month I should say, all 
of a  sudden I had a very good 
month. I was top salesman in 
the comp any, and from that point on, I s -- be
came one of the top salespeople in -- in the 

company, which was a 
nationwide company. 
Q: What was it? 
A: The name of the comp any? First Investors Co
rporation, at 120 Wall Street at that time. 
And then I was -- then I was promoted to 
group manager, which means I formed my  own 
group, and then I was promoted  to vice-presid
ent of the company, 
with an office in 
Newark, New Jersey, and 
another office in Morristown. Th at was small office, then. The 
office in -- in Newark, I had a s -- I had about 
close to a hundred salesmen. As fact, I had 
a hundred  salesmen. And ev erything -- And I stayed with the comp any fo r 17 years. And 
then -- 
Q: Wait, before we leave Newark, I -- I just
 -- I™ve heard so mu
ch about the Jewish 
community, was there a large Je
wish community
 in Newark? 
A: Yes, a very large community, but not -- 

Q: But you chose not to live there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
41
 
 
 
 
A: No, no. The Newark  -- The 
Jewish community  in Newark, the people were born there, 
but by th e time 1950 came around, they
 started moving out of Newark. 
Q: Why was that? 
A: Well, I assume -- I assume that Newark
, th-th-the -- the population shifted, and 
somehow, I -- I can™t put my -- exactly my
 finger on it, but the -- the mix-up of the 
population shifted. 

Q: You mean with Blacks? 

A: It became a minor -- Blacks, and -- and -- 
and -- and so on. And it became a mu-much 
more dangerous city to live in. 
Q: Do you -- Would that be around 1954, it 
says that was when Brown versus the Bo ard 
of Education, the Supreme Court ends longst
anding practice of separate but equal public 
school facilities?  

A: Right. Right, right, right.  
Q: Do you remember
 [indecipherable] 
A: Th -- A-A-And don™t forget, these people 
had ch ildren, and the -- and the educational 

system -- the educational system
 in -- in Newark was not up to
 standards, just like the -- 
like today, the educational system in New York
 City is not up to standards, and that™s 
where we have, you know, a lot of 
controversy o-over 
that subject.  
Q: I™m sorry, go ahead. You -- 
You surely have had -- started 
having children now in th is 
-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
42
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, we -- well, we waited. We waited fi
ve years. And that™s what you call really 
planned parenthood. We waited five years and 
after five years of -- of marriage, we felt 
we could now afford to start a family. And so  
we had our first son, Robert, and then, after 
th-three more years, it -- it -- it 
doesn™t sound very romantic, 
I might add, but after three 
years, we decided we -- or -- well, actually, 
after two years, we decided we really would 
want another child. And -- And exactly three years later, we had another son. 

Q: Born  the same day? 

A: N-No , but same month, and -- 

Q: And your -- your children™s -- children™s names? 
A: Yes, the -- the oldest is Robert, and th
e younger is Peter. And 
-- And that made me 
very, very  happy, because you mu st reme mb e
r, my family, the von Halle family, and I 
mentioned to you, I have a family tree that
 goes back to 1672, a
ll von Halles, and here 
we™re wiped out, at least my part of the tr
ee was completely wiped out. I am the -- I was 
the only male surviving. And so when  Robert 
was born -- or -- or when I got married, I -- 
I felt, now there are two von Halles. And wh
en  my  -- when Robert was born, we had 
three von Halles. And when  Peter was bor
n, there was four von Halles. And -- 
Q: I™ll -- I g o  now to the other side of the tape. 
A: Oh -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape two, si
de B, of Gerry von Halle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
43
 
 
 
 
A: So now we -- we had two ch
ildren. They really were -- we
ll, of course, every parent 
says that, but they were rea
lly great children, easy, not di
fficult to bring up, no problems. 
And -- 
Q: What years were
 they born in? 
A: I™m afraid you were goi
ng to ask that. If my wi -- If my wife were here --  
A2: I™m here. 

A: Robert was born in -- 

A2: ™57. 

A: ™57, an d that means Peter was born in 
™60. And they  were both born in  March. 
Anyhow, they -- they grew up.
 First they lived 
in Tean eck, then we moved to  West 
Orange, and they went to West Orange High 
School. And then th ey went -- And then we 
moved to Short Hills, and -- and then they left
 the house and went to college. Robert, the 
oldest, went to Northwestern. 
A2: No, he went to Duke. 

A: I™m sorry, I™m sorry. Robert went to Duke
, and then later on went to Northwestern, to 
graduate school. Peter went to Northwestern
 undergrad. And the 
only interesting thing 
about those boys of mine, when  they were about
 in their last year of college, Robert came 
to me and said to me, ﬁ D ad, I don™t even know  what -- what you really do for a living.ﬂ I 

mean, they knew wh at busin ess I was in, but th
ey really didn™t kn
ow. In the meantime I 
might say, I -- after 17 years with the investme
nt firm, let me just -- I™m skipping around 
a little bit. After 17 years with 
the investment firm, I decided 
I wanted to be in my own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
44
 
 
 
 
business. They were very good
 to me, but I wanted my  -- have my  own business. So, in 
19 -- oh, 40 fi -- in 1954, I believe. No, it probably was later, I -- I left the firm, and I 
started my  own business, with a -- with 
a partner, and th e firm became known as von 
Halle - Goldman associates. And again, the beginning was very, very difficult, but I -- I 
realized that. Every -- Every beginning is diffic
ult if -- n o thing -- as they say, nothing is 
for nothing. And so I started my  own busin ess,
 which was in the investment business, but 
also in the insurance 
business. And we -- As I said, a ve
ry tough beginning,
 but then we -
- we work ed, and we work ed an d -- and -- and 
we did all right. And af
ter about five years 
with my partner, we decided to split, even 
though to this very day, we™re very close 
friends. It wasn™t a matter that w e couldn™t ge
t along with each other, 
it™s just that he had 
different ideas about how to  conduct busin ess than I had. And -- A-And so then  the firm 

became von Halle Associates. Now, coming back
 to my two sons, who were in college, 
the oldest was in Duke, and he came up to me 
one day, and he said 
to me, ﬁDad, I-I really 
don™t know what -- what you are doing, you 
know, wh -what -- what you -- wh at do you 
do all day long?ﬂ I says -- He said, ﬁCan I come
 to your office and -- and see what you™re 
doing?ﬂ I said, ﬁYou™re welcome any -- any time.ﬂ So he came down to my  office, he sat 

down , and after a half a day, he said, ﬁDad, 
that™s a nice busin ess of yours, but not fo r 
me.ﬂ And out he went, never saw him again in
 my  -- in my  office, of course, you know. 

Three years later, my younger son, Peter, at 
N o rthwestern, said the same thing to me, 
basically. He says, ﬁDad, I really don™t know 
what you™re doing. I™d 
like to spend the day 
with you in the office.ﬂ I said, ﬁP eter, be my
 guest.ﬂ So he comes down, and he stays all

day, and he says, ﬁThis is 
a fabulous business, Dad. I like to work  for you during th e 
summer.ﬂ This was just, you know, when  th
ey had summer vacatio ns. I said, ﬁPeter, 
here™s a desk, and let me tell you couple things about the busin ess.ﬂ We
ll, my  son Peter is 
like a sponge. You tell him something once, a
nd you never have to  
tell him again. As it 
turned out, Peter, after he graduated college, 
he wanted to come into my business. And I 
said to him, ﬁPeter, you cannot come into 
my business until you have
 a job on your own.ﬂ 
Now, he graduated in -- in -- in Northweste
rn, in Chicago, and in -- I said, ﬁYou get 
yourself a job in  the industry, and after a year
, we™ll talk about it.ﬂ So, after -- S o , he got 
himself a job, learned a great de
al. After six months he calls 
me up, he says, ﬁDad, I want 
to come, you know, join you.ﬂ
 I says, ﬁRemember our ag reement was a year? It™s only six 
months. Wait another six months
 and we™ll talk about it.ﬂ So
, six months later, after a 
year, he calls me, and he joined the firm. To
day, my  son Peter is exceedingly successful, 
even more successful th
an I was, and today he owns the 
firm. He owns the firm. I still -- I 
still work there, you know, not -- 
not from nine to five, but f-from -- 

Q: Where is it? 

A: It™s here in Clinton, New Jersey. 
Q: Wow. 
A: Clinton, New Jersey. 

Q: How did you know to tell him to wait a ye
ar and wo rk  somewhere else, or why did 
you tell him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

A: Why? Because I felt anybody -- I didn™t want him to feel that, you know -- he had to 
understand what the wo rld is a
ll about, and wh at busin ess is all about, and i-i-i -- he has 
to be knocked around, if that™s
 what it takes. And I felt that™s
 the way I wanted it. I didn™t 
want him to feel, ﬁWell, I work for Dad.ﬂ 
First show that you can do it on your own, and 

then you can come talk to me, and th
en we™ll -- we™ll see where we go.  
Q: Before we leave your sons, 
your children, I™ve talked to 
all survivors about how and if 
and when they talked 
to their children about 
the Holo caust. Have you sp oken -- From the 
time you were young, did you speak to them, or
 did you feel you need  -- you needed to 

protect them? 
A: Y -- That™s a good question. I have not spen
t a great deal of time talking to them about 
what I went through. I -- I -- I can™t even gi
ve you the reason why I didn™t. I didn™t do it 
deliberately, maybe it™s just my nature, I -- I be
came -- I -- I -- it wasn™t because I wanted 
to protect them, it™s just that I didn™t talk ve
ry much about it, not that they didn™t know 
what -- what my background was, and -- and -- 
and -- and so on, and so on. I mean, they 
knew that my brother got
 killed, and that I was in a con
centration camp and all of that. 
They  knew all that, but I didn™t ma
ke a -- I didn™t make a big point. 
Q: Because they haven™t yet asked? 

A: Well, they -- One of them -- W ell, I do a 
lot of public speaking around the country, 
and -- and as fact, two years ago, I -- I was 
at a Temp le in Washington, D.C., we had 
2,000 people there, and that was a lot of peopl
e. But anyhow, I do a lot of spe -- public 
speaking, and so  --

A2: They saw the tape -- 
A: Oh yeah. The -- My -- My kids did see 
the tape, yeah, so th
ey know my story. 
Q: Did you watch them as they
 watched, or [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t even recall, I don™t recall that. Ma
ybe I did and maybe I didn™t. I -- I -- I™m not 
sure. 
Q: How did your commitment to begin to sp
eak as a survivor, ho
w did that happen? 
A: Well, I feel very strong
ly. The Holo caust is probably 
the world™s worst Holocaust, 
I™ve -- there™s no other word for it, that ev
er happened in  -- in -- in the history of 
mankind, I -- I think. And here we are, this is
 1999, almo st 2000. The survivors are of an 
age where they may live another five years, 10
 years, or 15 years at the mo st, and th en 
everybody is gone. And then ev erything is seco
ndhand, third hand and so  on. I™m one of 
the sh -- genuine survivors, and 
I feel it is my duty
 to my people, and to -- to the world, 
so to speak, to talk 
about what happened in
 plain -- in plain lang
uage. And that™s why I 
do it, I -- I -- you know, I -- I don™t do it, I -- I do
n™t get paid for it, and I wouldn™t want to 
get paid for it, it™s -- it™s -- 
this is what I™ve -- I -- I fe
el I have to do. I owe it. 
Q: Do you speak in -- 
in -- to both Jewish and non-Jewish groups? 
A: Oh yes. The 2,000 people 
in Washington, D.C., 
a thousand of them 
were Jewish, and a 
thousand of them were Gentile, yes. 
Q: Do you think that the fact
 that the man, the professor 
who saved you was a non-Jew, I 
guess he was a Christi an -- 

A: He was a Christian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

Q: Do you think that that has -- 
A: A religious Christian, because -- 
Q: Did his -- How did you 
respond to his religion, or his religiousness? 
A: Very, very, very well. He -- He would re
ad from the Bible every day, to his -- to -- 
you know, to his -- with his wife, sitting ar
ound the table, and the children, the two 
children, and my  mo ther and I. And I learne
d a great deal. You don™t have to -- The 
Jewish religion is not the only religion, th
ere -- there are many other religions, and -- and 
they all have something to say, and they a
ll, you know. And of co
urse, I feel very good 
about the Christian religion, b
ecause remember, Jesus st a -- was as a Jew. He was a Jew, 

and -- and so I -- you know, 
I -- I have no problems.  
Q: So you actually did get to have some fa
mily life, even when you were in hiding? 
A: When I was in hiding, well family
 life is the wrong thi -- well, my -- 
Q: Why [indecipherable] 
A: -- originally, at -- d o wn at the farm, I had 
my  mo th er an d  my  -- my
 -- my -- my father 
and my mother with me. When I -- 

Q: I mean with the professor. 
A: Oh, oh, with the professor. Yes, we were 
-- yes, we were -- we ate together. In other 
words, when I say we were in a room togeth
er, when -- when we we
re in a room, when 
we ate, we -- you know, we ate together. 

Q: Was that one of the highlights of your
 day, to spend time 
with that family? 
A: Yeah, there wasn™t very much else to do.

Q: I wonder -- 
A: I did -- I did some -- I -- I did -- I™ll --
 I did some drawings, you know. I ma de a 
drawing of my  -- of Mrs. Initout, and so on, a
nd so on, so that™s th
e only -- and I -- I read, 
although there wasn™t 
that much to read. 
Q: So you read the Bible some? 
A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I w a -- 
Q: [indecipherable] available books. 

A: I was familiar -- I was familiar with the -- 
I mean, not that I -- if you -- if you were to 
quote -- ask me questions about it, I -- by no
w I probably  have forgotten a great deal 
about it, but -- 

Q: I -- I know th at this is going to maybe 
sound like an  odd questio
n, but do you think 
that living th at closely with a wo man, your
 mother, has affected your awareness or 
perception toward women in general? 

A: Well, let me say I -- I -- I like women. Th
at™s -- If that means an ything. No, I don™t -- I 
really don™t think so . Not that I -- I mean, I -- 
I think I™m pretty mu ch level head ed, I have 
no -- I have no -- I -- I -- I love women. I ma
rried my wife so many years ago, so -- 
Q: Is your wife a survivor? 

A: Yes. 

Q: From the -- 
A: Well, is she survivor, the an
swer is -- is -- is no. Sh
e -- She was -- She came here in 
1939. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

Q: From? 
A: From Germany. 
Q: So you™re both German? 
A: We are both German Jews, yeah. 

Q: Trying to think. There are so many things
 that happened since the McCarthy era that -- 
in current events, I wonder if any of them affe
cted you directly or indirectly, such as the 
Korean War? 

A: Well the Korean War, I think, was a foul
ed up -- we had no business doing what we 
did in Ko rea, get involved in -- in -- in that -- 
in that thing. I -- I don™t want to call my self 
a -- a student of the Korean War, but I -- I f
eel that -- I -- I think we made a mistake 
getting involved in the first place. 

Q: And I guess, during the time that you 
were -- your sons were young, was the 
beginning of the protest -- the movement in th
e United States, Civil Rights protest. Did 
you -- Did you have any 
feelings about racism, did you rela
te at all to that movement, or 
did you see it as totally separate from what you expe
rienced in the Holocaust. 
A: Well, it™s -- it™s -- it™s co
mp letely -- well, you ca -- I can™t say comp letely, it is 
different from -- from -- from the 
experience that we had. Our experience was one of, if 
they catch you, you™re dead
. The Civil Rights movement was one of oppression of 
people, not systematic killing of people. That -- 
That -- That is not to 
say that they didn™t 
-- that not m-many Blacks were killed, but they
 were not killed by the government, more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
51
 
 
 
 
or less, they were killed by people who just 
 hated them, and so it™s -- it™s hard to make a 
-- a connection between the two, although I™
m sure you could. I™m 
sure you could.  
Q: I know that there were lots of Jewish 
young people who were in
volved in the Civil 
Rights movement.  
A: That™s correct. Right, ri
ght, and who -- and who -- 
Q: Do you think that that -- that may have
 been part of their understanding of -- 
A: Well, I think the Jewish people have alwa
ys had a strong feeling about Civil Rights, 
and you know, being -- bei
ng an  oppressed people fro
m -- from way back, I mean, 
whether you go to Ru ssia, and I mean, you 
know, the Russian -- th
e -- the Jewish people 
have been oppressed for -- fo
r -- for -- for -- from -- from da
y one, actually. But -- So I -- 
I think the Jewish people have a -- you will find their -- their voting pattern in -- in -- in 

America, is one of liberalism. That is not 
to say there are no -- there are no Republicans, 
Jewish Republicans, but it™s -- it™s -- they™re 
-- they tend to be on the liberal sid e.  
Q: Vote perhaps more related to issues than to economy? 

A: Yes, yes, I would say so, yeah , yeah. 

Q: And the Vietnam War, was there some -- 
A: Lesson to  be learned? 
Q: Well, did you respond in  any way specific, that -- 

A: No, I did not. I -- Well I -- No, I di -- I 
did not respond to  it. 
I probably would have 
responded to it, if -- if I had 
been  drafted, or so, except I 
was past the draft age, so it 
didn™t affect me directly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
52
 
 
 
 
Q: How about your sons? 
A: My sons? That™s a different -- yeah, yeah. 
Q: How were they affected? 
A: Well, I -- I -- How were they affected, well, I think they were -- 

Q: Were they old enough to  be -- 
A: No. In other words, I was too old, and they
 were too young, so -- so we were -- but it™s 
-- it has affected the united -- th-the -- the -- it 
has affected the entire 
country, and not in a 
good manner -- in a -- not in a good way. It 
was a -- We lost a lot of, lot of people, and 
we killed a lot of, lot of peop
le. And when you get to that 
combination, it™s -- it™s not -- 
it™s not a good thing. 
Q: Just to go back a little b
it. In the early 60™s, where were you when President Kennedy 
was shot? What were you doing? 
A: Well, I was -- I was standing at a -- at a cand
y s -- at a candy counter, in -- in an office 
build ing, trying to buy a piece of candy when
 that word came out, and of course, I don™t 
think there™s an American 
today who doesn™t -- I mean, 
of -- of age, who would 
reme mb er, who doesn™t know ex actly wh-w ha
t he did and wh ere he was. I -- I was 

shattered, I was absolutely sh
attered, I -- when I saw the funeral -- and I™m not a person 
who™s easily -- who will shed tears easily, be
cause I was brought up that men don™t cry. 
Whether that™s right or wrong, that™s a diffe
rent story, but that™s the way I was brought 

up. But when Kennedy™s funeral, 
I -- I shed lots of tears.  
Q: What do you think he re
presented to you and to  the country  at -- at large? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
53
 
 
 
 
A: Well, you see, I think -- I think JFK is r
eally larger than life. Why? Because number 
one, he was so extremely handso me. He -- 
His mannerism was -- I mean, I™ve never met 
another person who had his mannerism. And I th
ought he did a good job. Now, I want to 
be honest with you, I did not
 vote for him. But I -- I -- H-
He -- He represented -- you 
know, he had a beautiful wife, and had beau tif
ul children, and -- and -- and -- and he was, 
you know. 

Q: The country was sort of concerned 
about his Catholicism, weren™t they? 
A: Yes. He -- As -- As -- As 
you obviously  know, he was the 
first Catholic to -- to be 
considered for president, and he -- he w -- 
handled it extremely well, extremely well. He 
didn™t ma -- He didn™t -- He didn™t go round
 the bush. He says, I™
m -- I™m Cath olic, but I 
also want you to  know, my  loyalty is numbe
r one to America, a
nd number two to the 
Pope. The Pope is not going to  tell me how 
to handle my  job. And -- And -- And not in 
those wo rds, but that™s basically what he said. 

Q: Do you remember why 
you didn™t vote for him?  

A: I am not what you might consi -- I -- I 
am the exception to th
e rule, I™m -- I™m not 
what you might consider a liberal. Now, that 
doesn ™t make me -- I™m 
a s -- I™m a centrist. 
I feel there are three -- three 
parts to -- to a political system
. There is the -- There is the 
left, the rig h t, and there is the middle. And I don™t belong to the left, and I don™t belong to 

the right, I belong to  the middle, which makes  it very difficult sometimes. 
Q: In what way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
54
 
 
 
 
A: Well, makes it difficult because you really
 don™t know -- sometimes the can d idates 
don™t, on either side, don™t fill -- fill your bill. 
Q: Well, do you think if Kennedy had lived  to
day, that he would have been so honored? 
A: So honored as -- as -- 
Q: As what he was when he died ? 
A: No. I don™t think so. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: But -- But -- But that™s not -- that™s not
 to say anything bad ab out him. I mean, a 
president being mu rdered becomes a -- gets into
 a -- his own stratosphere. It™s -- It™s a 
different -- It™s a different situation. If a -- If 
a president dies of natural causes, well then, 
he just dies, you know. We c -- You see, we 
can look at Roosevelt because he died. We 
can look at -- We can look at
 Truman, he died of natural 
causes, but Kennedy, he was 
assassinated, and that puts 
him into -- you -- you know. 

Q: What about another president after him,
 called Nixon? What 
did you th ink of his 
handling of -- 

A: Nixon -- Nixon, I -- I -- I liked Nixon™s fo
reign policy. I thought he and -- and -- and 
Kissinger opened up China, and 
I think that was a very important step. What did -- didn™t 
I like about Nixon? Wh en he was -- forget ab
out as a president, when  he was in the 
house, and -- and -- and he was sort of a si
dekick to MacArthur -- Joseph McCarthy. You 
know, he -- I didn™t like that aspect of him, 
he w -- and there were other things, and then  
of course, towards the end, when -- when
 th e -- when he did 
the -- the -- the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
55
 
 
 
 
Q: Watergate. 
A: The Watergate thing, I mean, he
 was completely out of bounds. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, but he was not a -- he was not a bad 
president, especially 
in the foreign affairs 
field. 
Q: You liked  the way he handled Vietnam? 
A: Well, Vietnam really was Mr. -- that™s 
really wh ere Johnson was mo re involved in -- 
than -- than Mr. -- Mr. Nixon.  

Q: Mm-hm. Although Johnson would not 
agree, but he™s not alive to speak. 
A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] 
Q: Was the Feminist movement of inte
rest, or affected you in any way? 

A: None whatsoever. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: No, I didn™t -- I -- Let me -- y ou know, 
now we™re really getti
ng into politics. The 
Feminist movement, I -- I liked the Feminist m
ovement when  they  started, but then I saw 
the Feminist movement go to ex tremes, and 
especially -- the Feminist movement, when 
they got to the point of Mr. 
-- Mr. Clinton, and his affair 
with Mrs. Lewinsky. That™s 
where the -- That™s where the Feminine m
ovement lost me. Because you either -- you 
can™t -- you can™t -- th-th-they more or less --
 more or less condoned what -- you know, 
this whole affair. And that™s -- that™s when 
they lost me. I thought they would stand up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
56
 
 
 
 
and vote for women. Vote for Mr
s. Nixon. Mrs. Nix -- Mrs. 
Clinton, you know, be with 
Mrs. Clinton, who was the -- the hurt 
party. But the women, they -- the -- 
Q: Did you not consider -- I™m wondering if yo
u did, cause I -- I -- as I was reading, I 
was thinking, this is -- a lot of the perspe
ctive was that this whole circumstance was 
private and personal, and th at it was being 
used to downplay any 
accomplishments that 
he might make, or speak out. He spok
e out -- He™s spoken a lot for women. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So did you -- did you ever cons
ider that side that said it 
was a ploy on the other side to 
discredit his accomplishments? 
A: Well, Mrs. Clinton called it a ex -- the Ri
ght Wing conspiracy. Now I -- I can™t talk 
about that, because I don™t know
 what -- whether there was a c
onspiracy or not, except if 
you™re asking me about the women™s movement, 
I -- I -- I really fe
el that the women™s 
movement should have stood up fo r wo men, a
nd that in this case
, it was Mrs. Clinton 
they should have stood up fo r, but they stood 
up for Mr. Clinton, and that™s where I tho -- 
I think th e Women™s movement went -- went off 
the track. But otherwise, I think they did 
a v -- they did a fine job. 
Q: I want to talk about Isr
ael, if you have any feelings ab
out it, but let™s take a short 
break, while I -- 
A: Okay .

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape three, side A, of an inte
rview conducted with Ge
rry von Halle, conducted 
by Ginger Miles on July 10
th
, 1999, for the United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum. 
This is a follow up interview of a United 
States Holocaust Memo rial Museum video 
interview conducted in 1990. 
The United States Holocaust Me
mo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for 
making this interview possible. 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Now I™m -- I™m relating to an 
article that you™ve just look
ed at in ﬁNation and World,ﬂ 
that was there April 24
th
, 1998, and it™s a statement th
at Netanyahu made about the 
Holo caust, saying, ﬁT his is the lesson of th
e Holocaust, this and 
only this. That the 
existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish  sovereignty, and a Jewish army  that rests 

on th e strength of Jewish faith.ﬂ And I wanted
 to ask Mr. von Halle™s opinion about this. 
A: Well, you must remember, we™re t -- he™s --
 he™s being quoted in conjunction with the 
Holo caust. As a Holocaust surv
ivor, and I™m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on, 
that when we were in Europe, we were 
alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr. 
Roosevelt didn™t think it was necessary, or pr
udent, or wh atever reason he had, to help 
the people in the concentration 
camps directly. By that I mean
 he didn™t feel he should -- 
he could, or he should or 
wh at -- for wh atever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks, 
bomb th e gas chambers, and -- and etcetera. No
w Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying is, 
the Jewish people, by necessity
 can only -- should
 only rely on th eir own strength. I™ve 
been asked many times the question, can wh at
 has happened in Euro pe, can it happen in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
58
 
 
 
 
the United States, and my answ
er has been, ﬁU nder the right circumstances. Under the 
right circumstances, it could happen here, too.
ﬂ What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to 
do with economics. If the economi
c situation in the United States gets so bad that people 
are desperate, people always look for a scap
egoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the 
Jewish people. Have been al
 -- through the centuries. And 
therefore, when Israel was 
made into -- into existence, I felt very, very
 good. Why did I feel 
good? There is now one 
country that you know has your interests at 
heart 100 percent. And if the situation ev er 
came where you woul
d have to leave the country, ther
e is one country that will accept 
you, and defend you. An
d how do they defend you? By ar
med mig h t, if -- if n eed be. 
Don™t forget, let me talk about, my wife came 
to the United States, 
on th e steamship Saint 
Louis, not the last one, the one before the 
last one. The last one, there were several 
hundred German Jews, left Germ
any after Hitler was in power 
already, trying to get to 
Cuba, had Cuba visas. At the last mo ment th
ey -- Cuban government refused entry. Then  
they went to Miami. We™re ta
lking ag ain about Mr. Roosevelt.
 I™m -- I -- As -- By now, I 
guess you know, I™m not a great friend of Mr. Ro
osevelt. Mr. Roosevelt didn™t feel it was 

necessary, or for political reasons, to admit 
those, whatever were, three - 400 German 
Jews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if 
the -- if this -- if -- 
if there had been  an 
Israel, these -- this ship could easily have go
ne to Israel, and these 
Jews would have been 
saved. So , when  you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I™m not a 
friend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I do
n™t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
59
 
 
 
 
better Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with 
the quote, yes. And that™s strictly from a 
Jewish point of view . 
Q: Have you been  to Israel? 
A: Yes, several times. It™s -- 

Q: Were your expectations of the place th
e same as the reality of being there? 
A: Well, again, a -- I™m speaking as a Holo
caust survivor. It -- It -- You know, I™m 
probably  one of the proudest -- well, no,
 maybe -- I™m -- I™m 
a very, very proud 
American. I -- I -- I can™t tell you -- I™m probabl
y mo re aware of being an  American than 
a native born American, because of everythi
ng I went through. So
, I™m a -- I -- I™m a 
very, very proud American. An
d when ever I go on a vacation, I™m -- I™m out of the 
country, and I come back to th
e Un ited States and say, ﬁA h, 
feels good. Feels good to be 
back.ﬂ I forgot what I was going to
 say in the -- in the beginning. 
Q: About Israel. 

A: Oh, Israel. Now Israel, I feel -- it feel
s good to see a country, where everybody in  
authority is Jewish. In other words, the polic
emen are Jewish, the -- the courts are Jewish, 
the -- the -- the army  is Jewi sh, the Air Force is Jewish, 
the -- the -- you know, wh atever. 
As a -- As a Holocaust survivor, makes you fe
el good. Now, does that mean -- now, 
coming back to the United States
 then, fa -- after I™m -- w as in
 Israel, as I said, I said, 
ﬁAh, feels good to be back in
 the United States.ﬂ Because, th
is, after all, is my country. 
But I have certain emo tional ties to Israel, yes.

Q: Do you think that you, as 
-- as -- as a Holocaust survivo
r, has a stronger tie, probably 
than most? 
A: To whom? 
Q: To Israel.  

A: Oh yes. Na -- No. A stro
nger tie? No, I don™t want to necessarily say that. As you 
know, Jews have very  strong emotional ties to 
Israel, and that™s probably  because of the 
Holocaust. In other words, you don™t have to 
be a Holo caust survivor
 to be emotionally a-
a-attuned, and -- to -- to Israel. 

Q: Well just as a survivor, wh
en you watch films like ﬁSchin
dler™s List,ﬂ -- did you see 
that? 

A: I di -- I did -- I did see that, yes. 

Q: Did you -- How did yo
u respond to the film? 
A: I don™t -- I thought it was an excellent f
ilm, but I -- y-you see,
 havinggone through 
this whole thing, it doesn™t affect me probabl
y as mu ch as it would affect you or anybody 
else, who hasn™t gone through th at experience
. There was nothing new in that film that -- 
you know, that I hadn™t ex -- 
either experienced, or -- or something like that.  
Q: That brings me to the subject, cause 
I know you didn™t speak with your children, did 
you speak with your wife about the Holo caus
t, or with your friends about it, or 
[indecipherable] 

A: No, not with my  friends. Well, yeah, my  
wife. I -- I speak with my  wife about it.

Q: You still talk about it? 
A: Yeah. No t on a -- you know, I™m not hung 
up, I™m -- you know, don™t forg et, by now, 
it™s 50 years later, I™m an American. And some
times I look back  on it, and it almost feels 
like, did I really go through all of that? I -- 
I™m -- I™m so  Americani
zed that yes, I -- I -- 
obviously I -- I -- as I said, there™s not a da
y that goes by that I not think ab out my  
brother. So it™s not that I forgot about it, but -- 

Q: Do you feel that -- Have 
you been aware, or -- of -- of
 anti-Semitism in America, to 
this day? 

A: Not really. 
Q: No? 
A: Not really. I have never -- I mean, you read  ab -- I read it in the newspapers, of what 

happens, you know, swastikas on a -- on 
a -- on a -- on a -- on a synagogue, but 
personally, never. Not -- Not -- Not once.  

Q: Most of your -- your friends are Jewish? 

A: Most of my friends are Jewish.  

M-Most of them are American born, although
 I have -- I have some friends who were 
born, you know, former refugees. As a me
r fact, you know, I don™t know wh ether you 
realize it, but actually -- and I™m not saying 
that as a -- actually, I™m not a refugee. 
Actually, I™m an immigrant. 
You can only be a refugee 
-- people who left Germany 
before the end of the war, they 
are refugees, they -- they fled
 the country. In my case -- 
and I always call myself a refugee, but t
echnically I™m not a re
fugee, I™m -- I™m an

immigrant, because I left after the war. I didn™
t have to leave, I could have stayed in 
Holland. But -- I mean  that™s 
just from -- from a technical point of view. People -- People 
ask me, you know, I -- I -- I always talk 
about it -- my self as a refugee, yeah. 
Q: Were people afraid when they 
left that -- n o t only that they
 wouldn™t be able to make a 
living, but th at it might happen again? Wh
y do you think so many people left Europe? 
A: Because there was nothing left. Their f -- Their -- Their families, you know, most of 
their families were gone. Those who survived, 
they had nothing, th ere was no reason for 
them to stay. And in our case, we alwa
ys had wanted to  co-come to America. 
Q: Your relationship with your mother, we
 haven™t discussed mu ch, on th e way -- when 
you -- when she got over here. 
I guess -- How long did she live? 
A: She lived -- She died about -- 

A2: 1987 
A: 1987. So that™s -- 
Q: Mm-hm. So she died -- 

A: So sh e™s -- That™s -- She -- She 
lived -- She lived many years here. 
Q: So sh e got to see your children, 
and know your wife
 and your family? 
A: Yes. Oh yes, oh yes. She -- She wa -- 
She knew my  wife, she knew my  children, and 
no, she never knew my grandchildren, no. 

Q: Oh, so you -- you have grandchild
ren, we didn™t talk about that. 
A: Well, I was telling you that when I cam
e over, I was one von Halle, then I married, 
there were two von Halles, then I had two sons
, we were four von Halles, and then -- then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
63
 
 
 
 
the children married, so there were six von Halles. My oldest son 
had two boys, so now 
there are six, eight von Halles. My younger 
son had th ree boys, so
 now th ere are 11 von 
Halles. If Mr. Hitler would know about it, that 
he -- that he missed this one Jew, who now 
produced 11 others, he would be ve
ry unhappy. He would turn  over. 
Q: Is there -- I know that you -- you have 
-- you go back and fort
h between Arizona and 
New Jersey, as well. Y our life in Arizona
, do you speak ther
e, also, do you -- 
A: Yes, yes. Well, when I say -- after -- we 
liv ed there for 15 years.
 I mean, w-we stayed 
there six months of the year, and six months 
we stayed in New Jersey. But, it™s funny, 
you were just asking that, we just -- after 15 
years we just sold our house, and we™re now 
-- we™re going to be in New Jersey year roun
d. That doesn™t mean we -- we can™t go to 
Arizona, you know, on vacation 
and -- and rent a place for -- for a month or two, you 
know, but my -- we™re no longer -- I no longer 
own the house since -- since last March. 
Q: And your famil -- your sons are in the area? 
A: My -- My son -- well, the one that™s in
 the business, who -- you know, my son now 
owns my business, he lived in mut -- in Ridg
ewood, an d my  other son lives in Chicago. 

Q: Is there anything else around the Holocaust
 or your life since, 
or somethingyou™ve 
learned from speaking to other people, or sp
eaking with audiences, have you been 
shocked about anything that they di
dn™t know -- that we didn™t know? 
A: Yes, yes. The averag e individual, now
 of course, it depends on wh ether you™re 
speaking to Jewish people or non-Jewish peop
le, it makes a big difference, but the Jewish 
people are pretty well aware of what -- what
 happened . The non-Jewish people know th e 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00

64
 
 
 
 
word Holocaust, and -- but they don™t really know the details. I me
an, when I say they, 
not -- you -- you can™t put a blan ket s -- you can™t make a blanket statement, but in -- in 
general, their -- their knowledge of the Holocau
st is much more limit
ed than -- obviously, 
of the Jewish people, yeah. No question about it.  
Q: Is there anything else that you™d 
like to add to -- before we close? 
A: Not really. I -- I™m -- all I can say is I™m 
-- I™m a very -- I™m a v ery -- you know, I -- 
this is my third country. You know, I was 
born in Germany, I grew up in Ho lland, and 
I™ve lived in -- in -- in the Un
ited States for now over half a 
century. And to me, I -- I -- I 
feel -- I feel so proud to  live in this country , 
and to  be an American, and I -- I -- I couldn™t 
be any happier in -- in any -- in any which wa
y. Th -- America has been great to me, has 
given me all the opportunities th
at you could ask. Yes, you 
have to grasp 
them, andyou 
have to go for them, nobody™s 
going to put it on -- on a -- on a silver platter, but whatever 
opportunities I wanted, I -- I -- I g o t, and so  
I™m grateful. And I might say to you, and I 
will never miss an election [indecipherable], and I feel all Americans, my fellow citizens 
should -- should -- should reali
ze what it means to be able to
 go to  the polls, and -- and -- 
and -- and vote. I don™t know wh
e -- I -- maybe that doesn™t be
long into this -- into this 
tape, but I -- I feel -- 

Q: No, it™s very important. 

A: I -- I feel very strongly about that. 
Q: How -- How the Holocaust has affected y
ou politically, and your 
beliefs, an d -- is the 
purpose of these follow up interviews. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00
55  
65
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s very important. So if you feel that 
voting is one of the mo st important things -- 
A: Very, very, very, very impor
tant. And you have to be aw
are of wh at™s go -- you know, 
we Americans have a tendency of -- when we 
read the newspaper, we start off with the 
sports pages, which is fine, I mean, there™s 
nothing wrong with readin
g the sports pages, 
long as you don™t forget to 
read the first page, too, and 
know what™s going on, you know, 
in the judicial system, and -- and -- and ev
ery -- everything else in political system. 

Q: And behind that belie
f is what? Why, why is
 it important to vote? 
A: Because the alternative is 
so terrible. Because if you -- 
if you don™t vote, then you™re 
leaving th e decisions up to people who have 
an agenda wh ich usually isn™t for the benefit 
o-of the whole country, because
 they are -- there are always
 people who will, you know, 
the mo re extreme, and I™m not saying on th e ri
ght or on th e left, m- mo re extreme, your -- 
your -- your -- your opinions are, those people
 will vote, and if you don™t vote, your voice 
won™t be heard, and detrimental to our system. 
Q: I™m trying to  think if there™s anything el
se that we™ve left out
, that you™re going to  
think once I leave. 
A: I think we -- we pretty much cove
red it, we pretty much covered it.
