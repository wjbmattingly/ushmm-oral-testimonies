United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 i n 
Washington
, 
D
.
C
. Can we begin by havi ng you state your name, and spell your 
n ame?
 
Answer: Myname is 
Samuel Marein-Efron
, spelled 
Œ hyphenated last name, and I 
was born i n 
Budapest
, 
Hungary
 on Ma y 5
th
, 1933. And my parents™ names were 
David
 and 
Dwojra
, 
d-w -o-j-r-a
, which is basically Polish for 
Deborah
. My father 
was born i n a little town near 
Bialystok
, called 
Krynki
, 
k-r-y -n-k-i
. And my 
mother was actually born in 
Kiev
, in the 
Ukraine
. And in order t o Œ to get back i n Œ 
into 
Poland
 after the we Œ 
wel ma 
Œ when t he Russian revolution started, the y had to 
f 
Œ get her a false Polish birth certificate. And theoretically,  on official papers, it 
appears that she was born in 
Bialystok
. 

Q: Your parents moved to 
Budapest
. When did they move to 
Buda pest
, and why? 
What was the Œ 

A: Well, it Œ it™s Œ it has the Œ it has a history. My father was doing quite well in 

Poland
, until 
Pil sudski
 came in. Then there was something which is referred to 
historically as the 
Ugannah
(ph). And basicall y what that was, it was a tax system 
which taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn™t do very much for landowners, or 
others. So m y father was pressed financially, and he gave up Œ basically the y sold

their factories in 
Poland
, and the Œ they Œ m y uncles remained, and they used to 
rent space in Œ in ot her factories, but m y father, at first, moved to 
Finland
. And that 
was a little bit too far from Œ from 
Poland
. So he moved again to 
Zemu
n
 in Œ well, 
today it is 
Serbia
. And in 
Serbia
 he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of 
the king, who liked his business, so the y gave him 72 hours to leave the country. 
And he had a Œ a number of jobs, until finally he Œ he found a job with a v
ery 
big 
Hungarian complex cal led 
C
sepel
, that was run by a Œ a Jewish entrepreneur, 
Manfred George
 Œ act ually, 
George Manfred
. Hungari ans, the y do it the other 

way around. And he was head of Œ he first became the head of the factory that they 

had in 
Slovakia
, in 
Zylina
, 
z-y -l-i-n-a
. And first my mother wouldn™t Œ wouldn™t 
think of Œ of living there, and nunb Œ it was the center of Œ basically, of Slovakian 

nationalism. This man 
Klinker
(ph) and Œ and 
Tiso
(ph), t his was their main Œ main 
center of operations. 
Andso my mother wasvery unhappy there,so 
she said Œ she s 
Œ when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided t hat she Œ this was not the 

place to deli ver a chil d. So, we moved to the headquarters of the conglomerate, 

which was 
Budapest
. 
Q: Could you sa y the name of the company again, and spell it? 

A: It was called 
Csepel
, 
c-s-e-p -e-l
.  
Q: And what Œ what did it do? What kind of company was it?

A: It was a huge compl ex, basically. It™s Œ it™s biggest income came from food, 
from importing and export Œ basically exporti ng Hungarian agricultural products, 

but he was also the mai n producer of aluminum in 
Hungary
. He Œ they had a 
generators sunk int o the 
Da nube
. And not onl y did they produce aluminum, the y Œ 
they actually gave el-el ectricity to Œ to 
Budapest
. And another thi ng which they 
used to do were Œ was airplane part s. They used to manufacture airpl ane parts, and 
they had a big, big texti le complex on the i sland. It Œ 
Csepel 
is really t he name of an 

island in t he 
Da nube
, but it was called 
Csepel
, the complex itself. It™s Œ it Œ it 
basically Œ he Œ he was pro Œ th-the owner was probably the second or third we-

wealthiest person i n Œ in Œ in 
Hungary
. And he Œ he Œ he was basi call y very, ver
y 
friendl y wit h the government. In Œ  and Œ a ny t ime the y were short  10 Œ 10 or 15 

mil lion dollars, he would lend it to them, in lieu of taxes, so you know, the Œ the Œ 
there was a very good relationship between him and the Hungarian government. 
Q: And you were born in 
Budapest
, after your parents had moved to 
Hungary
? 
A: I was born in 
B udapest
, yes.
 
Q: When were you born? 

A: Ma y 5
th
, 1933. 
Q: 1933. Can you describe your early life; what it was li ke as an immigrant in 

Hungary
, or your parents™ lives as i mmigrants; school, religion?

A: Well, I Œ I Œ I was li terally considered a Hungarian, even though by law, I wasn™t 
one. In 
Hungary
, to be Hungarian citizen, you had to have your father to be a 
Hungarian citizen, which m y father was not. He was a Œ a Polish citi zenship. He Œ 

he Œ he was born actuall y i n the Russian part of 
Poland
, but after 
Versailles
, that 
became again, it was recu Œ constituted as 
Pol and
, so he re Œ 
he bec
ame a Polish 
citizen. But I Œ I was considered a Hungari an in school and elsewhere. My parents Œ 

Hungarian is a very difficult language, and m y mother spoke it passabl y, m y father 

very, very little, and my sister learned to speak Hungarian quite Œ quite well, I 

mean. My sibling is seven and a half years ol der than I was, and she was actually 

born in 
Bi alystok
, and she Œ she did learn Hungarian quite well, yes. But we were 

both considered real ly Hungarians, even though nobody asked for our passports, 

which was a l Œ a lucky thing. 
Q: So at home did you speak, Russian, Polish, Yiddish? 
A: Well, this i Œ this is very complicated, act uall y, th-the Œ the home language used 

to be Russian. When I was born, I Œ I was not taught Russian. So basically, it 

became a mi x 
Œ mixture of German of Yiddish. My sister spoke Œ di dn™t speak very 

good Yiddish, she talked mostly German, because she went to German schools. My 

father spoke Yiddish, my mother spoke very, very bad Yiddish. She spoke a very 

complex mixture of Yiddish and German. It Œ it™s Œ it was a complicated affair. In

other words, no Œ no t wo people had a comm on language, you know, three peopl e 
had a common language. 

Q: And you also Œ since you grew up in 
Budapest
, you also spoke Hungarian? 
A: I spoke Œ I spoke at first onl y Hungarian. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And then I Œ I learned German. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And I went for a while to a German school, and then I Œ somebody heard a Œ 
a 

heart murmur in Œ i n me, and so the y put me t o bed for six mont hs. And after I Œ I 

got out of bed, the German school  wouldn™t have me there. So I had to go to a Œ 
a 

Hungarian public school, which was perfectly adequate and nice.  

Q: How old were you when this happened, when you got taken out of school for a 
heart murmur?Do you remember?
 
A: I was taken out of school at about age five. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Five, five and a half. And I was put back in school around age six. And we left 

when I was age seven. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: W

Q: Oh. All right. We™ll get there. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the reli gious life of your fami ly? Were the y 

very religious, not religious? 

A: Well, m y father and mother came from very, very religious families, especially 
m y father. My Œ 
m y 
grandfather had been a 
melamed
, a teacher. And he Œ he was 
considered a rabbi. I™m not sure whether he had the 
smichas
, whether he had the Œ 
he could real ly be called a rabbi, but he was certainly Œ it Œ it seems, because I 

never met him, that he was considered to be an extremely knowledgeable person, 

and Œ and people used to come to him for advi ce. But m y mother came from a reli Œ 

religious family, but Œ 
an
-and we were relativel y religious. My mother kept a 
kosher home to Œ to her dying da y. And we Œ we used to go to holidays, to Œ 
to the 
synagogue, and m y fat her worked on Saturday, so that didn™t make him a very 
religious person. And when he was traveli ng, he Œ 
he ate whatever he co
uld get, not 
Œ not basically very Œ 
he 
Œ he did not think of keeping dietary laws, and things l ike 

that. I woul d say we were Œ we were traditional. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Not Œ not religi ous, but traditional.

Q: Oka y. And your father traveled a lot for work. He Œ what Œ and he worked for an 
[indecipherable]
 company. What, exactly, was his role in Œ 
do you know?
 
A: Well, hi-
his mai n 
Œ first of all, he Œ he was a specialist in Œ in Œ in producing a 
fabric which was made o
f 
[indecipherable]
 coat Œ coating fabric which Œ the word 

that has come to Œ to us, is 
loden
. A
nd the reason it™s called 
loden
 is that the fa Œ 
the main factory producing it, which was not from this complex, but from 

somebody else,a man
 
by 
name of 
Weingarten
(ph), was in a sect ion of 
Buda pest
 
called 
Loden
. So the y used to sa y yes, we want the fabric from 
L o den
, and the 
name stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he 

had was raw material . He had to find 
[indecipherable]
 and th-the Œ the Œ the two or 

three plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially 
these are the years where armies in Œ in 
Europe
 had to be dressed, and this was the 
basic coating material practically for everybody;  for the German army, for the 

Polish army, for the Œ you name it. Practically the whole western European armies 

used to consume this heavy, 
loden
 fabric. But the problem was to find raw material, 

which is why he ended up in the 
United States
, as a matter of fact.  
Q: Oka y. We™ll get there, too. 

A: Yeah.

Q: Before I want to Œ di Œ you were quite young when you left, but can you tell me 
a little bit about what your life was like in 
Hungary
? Do you remember when the 
Jewish laws were passed in 1938, how that affected your family? Do you remember 

those sorts of things? 

A: We
ll, I™ll Œ I™ll tell you very truthfully, in 
H ung a ry
 there was so much latent 
anti-Semiti sm that  with laws and without laws, it Œ it Œ it didn™t change the situati on 

very much. I was a l ittl e bit surpri sed at the question that I was asked, because 

curiousl y enough Œ and I spoke to m y sister about this, it  would seem that th-there 

was less tal k of 
Hitler
 in 
Hung ary
, as there was more talk of 
Mussolini
. So, some 
reason anot her, it was only in this corporate st ate was much more popular as a Œ 
as a 
piece of conversation, t han 
Hitler
. And anti-Semi tism was latent. In Œ in Œ in the 

years before we left, where we didn™t know where the outcome was, there was, you 
know, the y were pe Œ recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army, 
some were sent to work camps. The work camps turned out to be prett y much 

exterminati on camps. I mean, they Œ they worked you to Œ  to Œ to the bone, I think. 

There was a Œ 
a movie calledrou 
Œ 
Rosenschein
(ph), or somethi ng li ke that, whi ch 
described one of these work camps in Œ in 
Hungary
. But basically, no-nobody 
heard anything. At least w-we Œ we weren™t  aware of it. And goi ng to a German 

school, we were not  very aware of it. I mean, we were aware of it in t hat for 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron   
 
May 8, 2013

example, the Œ the Nazi clubs in which the youth Œ yout h clubs, wouldn™t have us. 
And that Œ certainly m y sister was absolutely livid, because you know, uniforms 

and parties, and Œ and excursions, and whatever it is. But even the school, there was 

no Œ no Œ no latent anti-Semitism. There were quite a few Jewish students in Œ in 

the Œ in the German school. 
Q: And when you went  to a Hungarian school, was it any different, or Œ 
A: No, no Œ 

Q: The same? 

A: Œ 
because we were all 
Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ I mean, since I Œ t he Œ the language, my Œ should be saying m y mother tongue 
was Hungarian. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I certainly was not Œ not looked upon very differentl y as any Œ 
as
 
anywhere el se.
 
Q: I feel like you ki nd of touched on this, but did your family live in a Jewish 

neighborhood, interact mostly wi th Jewish people, or mixed Hungarian Œ 

A: Well, basically, t here was such a huge Jewish population in 
Budapest
, that you 
can hardly pinpoint  a Œ  a Jewish neighborhood. I mean Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron   
 
May 8, 2013 
 
 
 
12
 
A: Œ all Œ all neighborhoods had Jews. We were living basically, i n the area which Œ 
right Œ right on the 
Danube
 where Œ where actually, where the Swedish embassy 
bought m
ost of those buildings, l ater on, I mean, we Œ were not there anymore. But 
that Œ that i s where Œ where the Swedish embassy bought all those buildings. It was 

right on the Œ on t he shore of the 
Da nube
, right in front of 
Saint Margaret™s 
island, 
Margitteet
(ph). And it was really Œ it was a wealthy community, it was Œ you had 

to have a certain Œ cert ain economic status to be able to live there. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ but then there were Jewish synagogues, Jewish 
[indeciphera ble]
. There 
were Œ there Œ 
there wi 
Œ there was even a synagogue three or four bl ocks down, on 

the street. But you coul dn™t pinpoint it as reall y Œ  as a Jewish section. There were a 

lot of Jews in there, but not Œ not necessari ly Jewish.  
Q: Oka y. So let™s move forward a little bit, and talk about your father™s travels, and 
how it brought him to 
New York
, and Œ and t he dates when that happened. 
A: Well, m yfather, around19 
Œ well, he Œ  he Œ he had constantly Œ was constantly 
on the move, trying to l oca
teraw materials, he 
Œ he went t o places, you know, 
which we t hought were absolutely the end of the world, li ke 
Greece
 or 
Turkey
 or 
north 
Africa
. But there were Œ there was consi derable wool merch Œ wool Œ wool 
products, used wool products there. He had the brother, for example t hat he set up 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

in business in 
Paris
, collecting for him. But no ma Œ he had Œ they had a 
relationship with t he English company cal led 
John Crow
ther
 
a nd So ns
, in 
Milnsbridge
, which supplied a lot  of raw mat erial too, but th-the y were always 

starved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizabl e pl ace that he 

could think of that would have raw material was the 
United States
. And basical ly, 
he also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn™ t seen i n some 30 years. 
So he, you know, he figured all of these things together, m y mother wouldn™t go, 

because we had to go t o school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And 

he Œ he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had t o 

set up this business. So he actually came to 
New York
, and he Œ he set up a 
business i n 
Passaic
,
 New Jersey
, and he spent here well over six months, I think 
about nine months, or something l ike that. And then he decided to go back to Œ t o 
Europe
, and he got as far as 
Belgium
, and took the train to Œ to 
Berl in
, but he was 
turned back, because the Germans had invaded 
Belgium
. So,he basically gotonto 
the same boat that he t ook to 
New York
, and came back to 
New York
. He made a 
second attempt to return to southern 
Europe
, but he only got as far as 
France
, and 
he had to turn back. And then, of course, the 
United States
 
was very, very 
Œ should 
we sa y, not  receptive t o Œ to Œ to refugees from an Œ 
anybo dy from 
Euro pe
, as they 
had this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled. 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

But anywa ys, he Œ he applied to sta y in the 
United States
, and he was hoping to 
bring us all there, at  least to sit out the Œ t he Œ t he war, because he knew that if he 
couldn™t get  back t wo ways, I mean there was no reason for us to Œ t o stay there. So 

he applied here f Œ as a matter of fact, there™s a man by the name of 
Yrin
, who does 

genealogy in this count ry, 
y
-
r-i-n
. And one day, from the blue, he contact me, 
because this Œ a second name in my last name is 
Efron
, and he was making a 

history of the 
Efrons
. And he asked me about it, and Œ and he seems to have found, 

in the 
Spri ng fiel d 
repository of the national archives, actually first papers 
from m y 

mother, m yself and Œ and m y sist er. But first papers, we never got the visa. 
Q: Right. 

A: So the problem was that he was about to Œ t o be deported. And somebody told 

hi m that in 
Mexico
, if he showed a certain am ount of money, you could get an 
investors visa. So, since he had a Œ he came with a considerable amount of mone y 

to set up this busi ness, there was no problem with that. He Œ he Œ 
he sira 
Œ he Œ he 
presented his papers, he Œ he Œ he put in Œ he Œ he showed them the deposit in the 

bank and so forth, and so on. And I understand there was a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
problem wit h Œ 
with telegrams and God knows what, but basi cally he got the Œ the vi sa about two 

days before he was goi ng to be deported from the 
United States
. So he traveled by 

train to the border, t o 
L aredo
. And this was June. 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

Q: June of? 
A: For Œ 1940. 

Q: 1940, okay. 

A: And 
Laredo
 in June is the Œ I t hink hell is cooler than Œ than 
L a redo
. It™s abou Œ 
about 105 Œ 110 i n the shade, and no shade. And this was before air conditioning. 
The only relief was a movie theat er, because the Œ the y had these huge ice blocks, 
which somebody was Œ they had ventilators blowing on t hem there; called ice 
cooled, or whatever it was. So somebody told hi m that 
Mexico City 
was somewhat 
more pleasant, it a Œ the weather was Œ was more pleasant. So he took the train t o 

Mexico C
ity
, he had a Mexican vi sa. So he took the train to 
Mexico City
 and Œ and 
true in Œ the temperature was like Œ like the 
Balkans
 and Œ and th Œ in the middle of 

summer, 
Mexico City
 runs around 22 to 26 degrees centigrade. Around 80, at Œ at 
best. So he found very pleasant. And by Œ by accident, he met some people that he 

knew from Œ from 
Europe
. He was sitting in the park, and suddenly he saw people 
that he remembered i n 
Paris
. You know, the Œ the Œ you had to Œ you had to know 
somebody toget money outof 
E
uro pe
 at that  time. Everybody had a Œ a currency 
control system. So he had Œ he knew these t wo people, one from 
Geneva
, one from 
Paris
, who had been doing this for Jews, all over central
 
Euro pe
. They were 
moving mone y in and out of central 
Europe
, and movi
ng it to the 
United States
, to

the 
Chase Manhattan
 bank, through 
Chase Manhattan
 in Œ i n 
Paris
. So he saw 
these two people in the park, and says, what are you doing here? They says, the 
same thing that you are. We are wait ing for an American i mmigrat ion visa. So my 

father said, you know what, we don™t know how long we™re going to have to wait, 

whether it™s a week, a month, or Œ or Œ or years. And we™re eating up our capital, 
you know, maybe we should start doing something. So t he y Œ the y got together, and 
they started a business, which lasted 50 Œ 54 years, 55 years, and by the ti me when 

m y father got his American i mmigration visa, he wasn™t interested. He had already 

made a 
Œ quite a comm itment to Œ to 
Mexico
. So we Œ 
we 
Œ we remained in 
Mexico
. 
Q: While yo
ur father was in Œ well , when your father left, what was your family in 
Hungary 
doing? I assume Œ did he leave Œ do you know if he left for 
New York
 
before or after 
Germany
 invaded
 Poland
, in 1939? 
A: He left Œ he Œ he must have left before the invasion of 
Poland
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: He Œ he must have l eft around probably June Œ 

Q: Oka y, so just before. 

A: Œ I Œ I rem Œ no, actually, he ma Œ ma y have left as Œ as Œ as much as late 1938 Œ

A: Well, m yfather, sinceh
e was st ill working through the company, we Œ 
we were 
drawing hi s salary, and m y father was probably drawing one of his bi ggest salaries 

in 
Hung ary
, if not the biggest salary. So we were living quite Œ quit e Œ quite 
comfortabl y, we Œ we had our apart ment on 
Santish
(ph) 
Venut
(ph), which is a po Œ 
a 
Œ 
a very 
Œ was a very st yl ish, very, very well-to-do neighborhood, and we kept 
living normally, the way we had tha Œ lived before. 
Q: Where 
Œ do you know if your parents started to become concerned when 
Germany
 invaded 
Poland
? Were there ideas on getting out then, or Œ 
A: Well, w-we were concerned, we were very concerned, because t wo things 

happened. The first thi ng was I had a cousin who was t he daughter of m y aunt in 

Poland
. Andshe had 
Œ  sh-she had not been able to get int o an Œ a Polish university, 
because of the numerous clauses, because of the Jewish exclusion rule. So she had 
taken on Œ she had gone to the 
Charles University
 in 
Prague
, and she was studyi ng 
medicine there, and we kept very cl ose contact with h
er. She 
Œ she used to come 
several ti mes a month to 
Budapest 
to see m Œ to see Œ see our family. And 
basically, m y father was supporti ng her. And she basically told us that, you know, 

they Œ she had been abl e to speak t o her parent s up to probably November of Œ of 

1939. And the wa y she mi Œ she was able to speak to them is that basi cally she 

found a Œ 
a farmer 
Œ they found a farmer whose telephone was st ill working for

long distance calls. And every weekend the y used to be in touch with her. And then 
suddenly, at the end of November, they Œ no more was heard from them. She tried Œ 

m y cousin tried to go back into 
Poland
, she was sent back from t he border, she was 

not allowed in. And so, you know, we Œ we were extremely worried, because we Œ 
we heard nothing. That  was the last thing we ever heard of m y aunt and uncle. B ut 
m y 
Œ m y cousin was in constant touch wit h us. And as a matter of fact, even 
through the war, she was in touch with us. She Œ she was Œ again, she was being 
financed both economically, and fals
epapers, by the management of thecompany 

with Œ whi ch m y father had a partnership in 
Zylina
. So she basically Œ I Œ I don™t 
know how this man did it, but he Œ he Œ through the red cro Œ we were getting Red 

Cross letters almost every two or Œ two or three months. Heavily censored, but at 
least we got  news, and said that, you know, she was all right, and this and that, and 
the other thing, but  w-we kept pret ty Œ pretty Œ pretty much in touch with her til  Œ til 
early 1944. 
Q: Oka y. And I definit el y want to hear more about your father™s i nvolvement in 

finan Œ in, I guess supplyi ng false papers t o people in places. Is that Œ 

A: Well, it Œ it is Œ  the Œ the company, which was Œ m y father ori ginally got int o the 
companyby managing the 
Œ the Œ this huge plant that they had 
Zylina
, in 
Slovakia
. 
And the plant was managed by man called 
Mouseko pf
(ph). This man 
Mo usekopf

was Jewish, and he Œ he managed t o Œ to Œ  since he Œ it was important for the 
German war effort Œ I mean, he was producing coating and fabrics for Œ for the 

German arm y. He was what the y call a protected Jew. So basically he Œ he was able 

to move around and Œ and he was able to Œ to employ a lo Œ there was a very big ge 

Œ pop Œ Jewish populat ion in 
Zylina
. 
Zylina
 i s very close to the Poli sh border, it™s 
a 
Polish German border. So, he was able to Œ to Œ to supply jobs t o a lot of the Jews in 

the Œ in the city, and many of these people were not supposed to be t here. In other 

words, the y Œ they had been refugees from 
Poland
. So they Œ Mr. 
Mouseko pf
(ph) 
man a
ged to get resi dence papers for them. And the y didn™t get residence papers, he 
did exactly what he did for my cousin, which is picked up papers of people that had 

died, or something like that. Which was very dangerous and not Œ not Œ it Œ it Œ you 

know, it™s something that ma y have worked for a month or two, and t hen they had 
to fire them, a-and give them a new set of papers, and rehire them, because the 
Germans Œ not the Germans, but t he Œ the 
USB
, the Slovakian secret  service 

suddenly got the list of people which had died, and this man Œ these peop Œ i-it was 

a 
Œ a very complicated undertaking, but he Œ he managed t o Œ to save, I would sa y 

several hundred, if not Œ not Œ not  a thousand, or more people in t he 
Zylina
 area for 
Œ from the Germans, until 1944, when the Germans came in, got rid of the

Slovakian puppet government, and that was the Œ then there the y t ook Jews, no 
mat ter whether protect ed or unprotected, or whatever the y were. 

Q: And is that the last you heard from your cousin? 

A: And the Œ 

Q: The last you heard from your cousin i n Œ at  that ti me? 
A: Well, m y cousi n 
Œ 
m y cousin isa 
Œ was a strange person. She was a strange 
person to the da y t hat she died. She was a rebel, of the worst sort. I mean, as a chil d 
she had joi ned 
Hashomer Hatzair
 in 
Bialystok
, which was not considered very Œ 
very Jewish, among the better Œ better members of the community, because they 

were the poorest of the poor, and the Œ the Œ they were definitely communistic. So, 

she had joi ned the 
Hashomer Hatzair
, and of course, she in see Œ she was the only 
one that was living in the Œ i-in a decent housi ng area, all t he meeti ngs were held in 
her apart ment, and m y uncle used t o absol utel y blow his top. But it passed. And she 
was like that, too. She went to Œ to 
Czechoslovakia
, and when t he Germans 

invaded, she Œ she Œ she was part of the Czech underground. She basi cally spoke 

very good German, and she looked German. She Œ she was blonde, bl ue e yed. Blue 

eyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces, 

and she got  herself a job as the doctor. She Œ she was still  a medical student, but she 

was in her process of getting her i nternshi p, whatever it is. So she was able to get

herself a job at the Gestapo jail in Œ in Œ i n Œ i n 
Prague
, and she became the conduit 
between the people which were being held at t he jail, and the underground and their 

families. And she did t his til 1941, the Germans invaded 
Czechoslovakia
 in 1938. 
The university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student 

strikes. But she Œ she remained there, and she became an i mportant cog in the 
communications system of the underground, with these people, until  Œ until the end 
of 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we™ve gone to the 

Holocaust Museu
m facilities, German files, and it™s a fact. I mean, the Germans had 
her take Œ they had picked her up several ti mes and let her go. But there was a Œ 
a 

record that she had been caught at Œ as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yel low Star of 

David
. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had 

managed to Œ she Œ  she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a 
mat ter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. 
Mousekopf
(ph) didn™t know 
it, but the y were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the 

list of Œ of people that t hey Œ they had to Œ so she came Œ she was taken to Gestapo 

headquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office Œ 

into his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of 
Bialystok
. So he Œ she 
didn™t let him sa y hello, it™s just Œ she sa ys, you know, ho-how did you ever have 

this picture of 
Bialystok
? So he sa ys, wel l, you know, I was stationed there, I was 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron   
 
May 8, 2013 
 
 
 
23
 
the head of the Gest apo in 
Bialystok
. So how Œ how were you related to 
Bialystok
? 
She sa ys, well, I Œ I bel ong to the German population of 
Bialystok
, which Œ which 
were factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And thi s is how I know 

Bialystok
 very well. My Œ  
m y 
Œ m y parents were still there for a whil e, I don™t 
know where the y are now, because the general Œ 
Generalgouvernement
 is not very 
informative as to where people are. So, you know, he made Œ she made a friendship, 
and when she walked i n, she was about to be sent to wherever Œ God knows 

[indecipherable]
 was sent. She managed t o walk out four hours l ater. And she 

managed also to Œ t his false paper that she had, she managed to gi ve i t a certain aura 

of credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, wel l, how come you are a 

communist? She says, you know, these were t hings of when you are a young ma Œ 

person, you 
Œ you think of other people, and t his and that, and not of yourself. But 
this is something which is Œ which is gone past. So she managed to Œ to survive this 

way, on this set of papers, for close to three Œ t hree Œ well, more than that, she Œ she 

Œ she crossed the Œ the Œ she™s crossed int o 
Slovakia
 
from 
Œ from the 
Czech 
Republic
, from t he other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that, 
and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a 

Christ mas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to 

cross into 
Slovakia
. Int o 
Slovaki a
, the y already had Mr. 
Mo useko pf
(ph) to help

her, and she lived i n 
Ni tra
 from late 1941 to earl y 1944, til practically August, 
September of 1944. She Œ she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There 

was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August Œ July or August of 1944, which was the 

reason that the Germans came in. The y felt that the Slovakians couldn™t handle this, 

so they came in, and they cleaned out the pl ace, to their li king. My cousin, curi ously 
enough, could have survived, but again, she Œ principle was Œ used to get her, and 
this time it  got her, too. Was basical ly she Œ she Œ she tells that she was picked up 

by the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of 

Jews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked i n, and sa ys, what are you 

doing sitti ng there? You™re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and 

she describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of 

the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it  is. 
So she basically walked in the next morni ng, into Gestapo headquarters and said, 
you know, you™re l ooking for Jews, I™m Jewish. The man was floored. He n
ever in 

his wildest  dream i magined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from 

being a Jew as Œ as Œ as you can i magine. Of course, didn™t Œ thi s di dn™t help her. 

But she helped other people. She took Mr. 
Mouseko pf
™
s
(ph) wife and daughter. 
Sh e 
Œ she Œ she was abl e to Œ she went to 
Birkenau
, and in the same t ransport, Mr. 
Mo usekopf
™
s
(ph) wife and daughter were Œ were in that same transport. Mr.

Mo usekopf
(ph) had been actually Œ was able t o hide with some Œ 
some Catholic 
priest. And she Œ she told the people at 
Birkenau
 that she was a surgeon, she was a 
Œ a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for Œ for the i nmates, but  for 
actually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to 

Gross-Rosen
, which was a satellite camp. And she said t hat she needed assistant s. 
She was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that  were working in 
the fields around 
Gross
-Rosen
. Soshe said
 that, you know, she needed assistants. 
So she got  the wife and daughter of Œ of this man 
Mo useko pf
(ph) to be her 
assistants, and all Œ all three survived the war. And she Œ she not only Œ she was 

actually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern 
Germany
, to see 
his mother, who was si ck. And she says she could have sta yed there. I mean, they 

liked her, the y Œ the y fed her, the y Œ they clot hed her, the y Œ and Œ and they were 
very interested for her to sta y around, because the mother seemed to be better with 
her being around. B ut she felt a responsibil ity, curiously enough, for t hose 200 

people in 
Gross-Rosen
, so she went back to the camps, and she sta ye d there til 
liberation, til Œ 
til Ma y 
Œ Ma y of 1945. Of course, we Œ we Œ we found out about her 

almost i mmediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us, 

and we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don™t know. I 

lost total communications with her. I spoke to 
Vera
(ph) the last ti me, which was

end of 19 Œ 1939, early 1940. And she Œ you know, she told us t he whole story, but 
we were Œ and m y father actually came back, and believe it or not , paid Œ returned 

the mone y to the company that had been gi ven out for my cousin, not for the other Œ 

well, the others worked at the company. B ut he felt that, you know, property pro Œ 

propriety was i mportant. 
Q: Well, what was your cousin™s name? 
A: How?  

Q: Your cousin™s name? 

A: Her name is 
Shula
(ph) 
Lozowska
. Her married name was 
Graf
(ph). 
Q: Oka y. 

A: As Œ 
asa matter of 
fact, it™s very funny, but  we were in 
Prague
 about two years 
ago, and one of the synagogues has all 50,000 deportees name on i t. So m y wife 
says, you know, do we know anybody here? So curiously enough, you know, 
50,000 names, coincidence is un Œ unbelievable. Right in front of m y face was 

Shula
(ph) 
Lozowska
. 
Q: Wow, my gosh.
 

A: 1913, it  didn™t have a second dat e for her, because they knew that she was 

deported to 
Birkenau
. Very, very few people came back from the Œ 
Birkenau
.  
Q: Wow. How do you spell her nam
e?

Q: Yeah, we can put you in contact with the Œ t he people who take care of that, 

definitely. 
A: Oka y. 
Q: That would be excellent.  

A: Cause, you know, it ™s Œ it™s worth it. 

Q: Yeah, no, that™s a very incredible story. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And thi s was all going on, your mother and you and your sister are still in 

Buda pest
 until 1940, right? 
A: No, we Œ we Œ we™re Œ we™re there til early ni Œ 19 Œ  

Q: Forty-one? 
A: Œ well, t h-that was also a confusing issue. First, my father kept wri ting sa Œ 

horrible lett ers about 
Mexico
, you know, poverty, dirt, this and that . My father Œ 
m y 
mother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? I mean, I™m perfectl y 

happy here. 
Budapest
 i s a nice, clean city, wit h no problems of any Œ any sort. So, 
basically, I actually thi nk that somebo

a 
general, or maybe even a field

marshal Œ I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the 
German arm y, came to talk to m y mother, and he told her, look, t his is no Œ no ti me 

for a Jew to be in Œ in Œ  in 
Europe
, and you know the Œ 
thiswill take a year,two 

years, and everything will be settled again, everything will come int o its normal 

course, and you™ll come back. But at this point, this is no point Œ no t ime to Œ for a 
Jew to be i n Œ in Œ  in 
Euro pe
. Convinced her. The next prob
lem was howto 
Œ how 
to travel. My father had arranged for her to Œ to take 
Verlichs
(ph) out of 
Trieste
 Œ 
th-the ship out of 
Trieste 
to 
New York
, there were two problems. First of all, she c-
couldn™t Œ she Œ she Œ it was very difficult to get a transit visa to t he 
United States
, 
which I thi nk she finally got. But before she could leave, 
Mussolini
 got into the 
war, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there Œ there were a lot of 

Jewish refugees who went to 
Russia
. In other words, they Œ 
they took
 the 
Trans -
Siberian
 t o 
Vladivostok
, from 
Vladivostok
 to Œ to 
San Francisco
, or if not, from 
Vladivostok
 to 
Osaka
, or 
Shang hai
, and from there to Œ to 
San Francisco
. So she 
figured that that made sense. I mean, 
Hungary 
has a border with Œ wit h 
Russia
, and 

she hadn™t seen her mother for, I don™t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she 

would do both thi ngs. So she started to get a Œ 
a 
Œ a Russian visa. She actually went 

to the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and Œ and obviousl y the consul 

was Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a

visa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you 
will be allowed to l eave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise Œ 
wise, you 

only give once. So she tried then, going out through Œ through 
Spain
, through Œ 

well, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wi sh to 

give her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn™t  give 
her a transi
t visaeit her on 
Œ except on the Poli sh passport. She still had the valid 
Polish passport. I mean, 
Poland
 didn™t exist, but she still had a valish por Œ Polish 
pa Œ of course, here t he problem came to the rest of 
Euro pe
. I mean, place like 
Switzerland
, a place li ke 
Austria
, a place like unoccupied 
France
. To them
 
Poland
 doesn™t Œ did not exist anymore. 
Q: Right. 

A: So, you couldn™t Œ you know, you can™t  travel through us wit h that Polish 
passport. So my father™s company, since t he y had such good relat ionship with t he Œ 
with the Hungarian government, managed to get, for m y mother, a 

[indecipherable]
 passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she Œ she got 

herself into, you know, this is a complicat ion. First you couldn™t  Œ at that ti me you 

couldn™t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden. So basically, 

she was Œ i -it took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit 

visas there. The German transit vi sa through all Œ through then 
G ermany
, German

Austria
, and you had to go through southern 
Germany
, through 
Münsing
 to 
Munich
, t o the Swiss border. And then you went across 
Switzerland
 to 
Geneva
, 
and then you took a Œ a train across 
Vichy
,
 France
 to 
[indecipherabl e]
 in 
Spa in
. 
The Œ the most difficult visa of them all was t
he 
Œ 
wasthe French, the 
[indecipherable]
 government visa. She managed to Œ 
to getit. She 
Œ  she was a very 
strong woman, and she wouldn™t take no for an answer, so she managed to get 

everything t ogether by about February of 1941. And we left for Œ for 
Spa
in
, and 
traveled through 
Germany
. We managed t o Œ to be in men Œ 
min 
Œ 
Münsing
, in 
Munich
 t he night  of the Œ of the speech of 
Hitler
 in the Œ in the beer Œ beer 
stuben
(ph), in the beer Œ beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know, 

being in the railroad station during a bombing i s the wrong place t o be. Anyways, 

noth Œ they did not bomb there. The y were tryi ng to get  
Hitler
, so they bombed all 
of 
Munich
, except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into 
Switzerland
, we had to sta y in 
Switzerland
 almost two weeks, I think. And then 
we went to 
Spa in
, and 
Spa in
 was another problem, because 
Spain 
Œ 
this was the 
end of the civil war, and th-there was no food in 
Spa in
. So we were given the 

privilege to live in Œ in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign 

dignitaries, which was not far from the 
Prado
. So we sta yed there til Œ til the boat 
that we were supposed to take, arrived in 
Vigo
. We went to 
Vigo
, we hada 
Œ a bad

experience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took 
everything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn 
Euro pe
 with 22 pieces of 
luggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha Œ anyways, in 

Spa in
, sh
e made a 
Œ a terrible mistake. S he met a Hungarian, and she said, you 
know, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I 
took my silver, I t ook m y jewels, I took t his, I took that, and everyt hing is packed 
away in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy 

went and spoke to the Œ to the Spanish customs. And we were al ready on the boat, 

and suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat , and the y 

want to see m y mother™s bags. So the y started opening bags, and m y sister, in all 

innocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from 
Switzerland
, and she 

offered it to the Œ to the inspector, t o the Spani sh customs inspector, you know, as a 
courtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn™t seen a bar of 
chocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everythi ng, we have nothing to do, 

we™re just holding up t he boat. Get  out. So, you see, we were Œ 
we were saved by a 

bar of chocolate. But my mother was, in t hat sense, you know, very st range. She Œ 

she used to Œ people used to tell her, don™t do t his. She said, I™ll do it, and I™ll Œ I™l l 

carry it through, and she Œ she was able to carry t hrough al most anything that she 

undertook. She 
Œ 
very 
Œ very strong personali ty.

Q: Do you know what kind of visas your fami ly traveled on to 
Mexico
? Were you 
also on investor vi sas, or Œ 

A: No, we had Œ we had an i mmi gration visa. 

Q: An immigration visa? 

A: Yes. A- Actually, that was very lucky, because the Mexican insis Œ wanted to 
have a Poli sh passport, but the y di dn™t trust passports in general. So basically, what 

they used t o do is, an Œ and I™ll try t o get you a copy of that, too, they used to give 

you a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a piece of cardboard, with your picture on i t, with a authorization to 
enter 
Mexico
. So basicall y, you didn™t have to have a passport. I-It  Œ it was just 
shown that the Œ at the consulate, or whatever it is, and t he consulate, put all the 

details of the passport in this piece of paper, and Mexican i mmigration didn™t Œ t he 

Œ the problem was, I understand, was 
Portugal
, because in 
Portugal 
t hey wouldn™t 
give her a transit visa, unless she had Œ showed a Œ a Poli sh passport, and she didn™t 

want to show it. So, finall y, after a long argument, sa ying look, 
Poland
 doesn™t 

exist. 
Poland
 
is now 
G ermany
. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we have no way of getting a Œ a German passport . So wi th that, and a litt le 

consideration, I thi nk helped Œ helped us get a transit visa to Œ to 
Portugal
. So what 
we did is we took the boat from 
Vigo
,and the boat madea twoda y stopin 
Lisbon
.

And in those two da ys that we stopped in 
Lisbon
, m y mother was able to pick up 
the Mexican visa, and she Œ we™re also able t o pick up matzos, because this was Œ 
this was Passover time. My mother had gotten from the Jewish comm unity there, 

kosher 
[indeciphera ble]
 of food. I have no idea how she carried it though all of 
Euro pe
, especially through 
Switzerland
, because 
Switzerland
 
forbade you 
Œ one 
of their Œ the only th-thing which was forbidden was to take food out of 

Switzerland
. There was plenty of food in 
Switzerland
, but you couldn™t Œ you 
couldn™t export any of it. My mot her was able to pull that  through, and quite a few 

chocolate bars, which were our salvation, sooner or later. 

Q: Do you know if you went to 
Mexico 
Œ if the Mexican government  knew that you 

were Jewish when you were getting your visas, or if you were just  traveling at Œ 

A: The Mexican Œ the Mexican government at the time was fairl y liberal, and it was 
fairl y liberal Œ this was the ti me of 
Lázaro Cárdenas
. 
Lázaro Cárdenas
 was 
probably the only world leader which was supporting the republic in 
Spa in
. And he 
had given i nstructions t o all of his consulates, t o give a-anybody t hat walked in, you 

give him a visa. So, first of all, m y father had the la Œ legal base to request a visa, 

but otherwi se, you would have gotten a visa as well. The y Œ they were extraordinary 

liberal. Unfortunately, very few people knew about this, so very few people avail ed 

themself of this situation.

Lisbon
. 
Q: In
 Lisbon
, okay. And you went to the Mexi can consulat e and got your visa to 
Mexico
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Oka y. And your boat ride over, who Œ were they most ly Spanish refugees? Were 
there other Jewish refugees on the boat?  

A: Well, more than refugees, I thi nk the y were mostly people who had business in 

either 
Cuba
, or Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ 
t here wererefugees. We 
Œ we traveled wi th a very religious man 
from 
[indeciphera ble]
 through all of 
Europe
. And there were sort of hair-raising 
experiences, I mean, wewerecrossing 
Austri a
, and this was right before the 
invasion of 
Yugoslavia
, and there were a huge amount of German troops moving 
through 
Austria
. The t rain was full of German Œ of Germans. And he, though, had 

to pra y, I mean Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s more, I mean 
[indeciphera ble]
 
and my 
mother was, you know, not very 
happy. I mean, not that  she knew t hat Œ 
what wasgoing on,but she 
Œ  she knew

Germans, and Germans were anti-Semites t o st art with, and here you have a very 
religious Jew. Luckily t here, I Œ I saved them, because the German officers were 

occupied with me, because basically, I spoke very good German, and Œ and the y 

were fascinated with m e. My sister helped me along, but basically it was I who Œ 

who the y were talki ng t o. A-Again, you know, the Œ an unusual situat ion wa Œ si nce 
the Œ since t here Œ there was five of us, three a Œ three in our family, and this man 
from 
[indeciphera ble]
 had somebody else with hi m. Not a wife, but somebody Œ 
and not even a woman, but another man with him, which wasn™t as religious as he 

was. But we were five in Œ in Œ in that compartment, so basically t he compartment 

was for six, but we managed to keep the com part ment for us five. So, basically, 

curiously enough, also the Œ the transit visa for 
Germany
 was gi ven to us the same 
day. The transit visa from 
Switzerland
 wasn™t. The transi t visa from southern 
Spa in 
wasn™t. The transit visa to 
Spa in
 took some time to Œ no-
no
-not as much as 
the French one, but  it t ook Œ and of course, you know, there were thi ngs which I 
noticed. For example, when we were traveli ng to southern 
Spain 
Œ southern 

France
, they
 
came 
Œ people came with paint in 
Geneva
, and they painted over the 
windows, which we are not supposed to l ook outside the Œ the Œ the windows. We Œ 

we Œ we Œ it Œ it was a long trip. Today Œ today it ™s also an 
overnight trip. We 
Œ we

made it, I t hink, in a day and a night, or somet hing like t hat. We got t o 
Portbou Œ 
Portbou
, t here was no Œ no con Œ there was no railroad connection i n 
Portbou
.  
Q: Where is that? 

A: That™s t he Spanish Œ Spanish border. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Yeah. 
Cataloni a
, and Œ and so we took a bus ride to, I think 
Girona
, and t hat 
was a Œ 
believe me, 
Mexico
 has nothing t o offer like that. It was a one Œ one Œ one 
lane road, an -and every ti me you met a truck Œ it was night Œ 
every ti me the y meta 

truck, you
 know, it was a Œ a battle of words to see who would go back to a place 

where Œ where the y could both pass. And this is not a very long t rip, but it took 

about eight hours t o Œ to get to 
Gi rona
. 
Girona
 there was a train al ready to Œ to 
Barcelona
. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: We stayed in 
Barcelona
, but i n 
Barcelona
 we didn™t Œ you could find two things 
to eat. One was bananas, and the other one was hazelnuts. So that was our Œ our Œ 

our diet was hazelnuts and bananas. 

Q: How did your mother manage, with all of this luggage, when you were changi ng 

modes of transportation so often? Do you know? Did you have help, or Œ 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

37
 
A: I really don™t know, I Œ I tell you very truthfully, I Œ I guess there must have 
been people to help you with bags, or somethi ng like that, because at that ti
me,  
every ti me you got to a border, you know, the inspection wasn™t on the train. You 

had to get off the train, take off your bags, t ake Œ take it to the cust oms house, get 

your document stamped at the cust oms house, have your baggage inspected, and get 
onto the train again. I don™t know how she managed, but she did manage. I Œ I do 
remember some passengers being very unhappy of the train being hel d up because 

of m y mot her, but somehow she managed to do it, she Œ she Œ she Œ she got us 

through all of these country Œ all of these borders, into 
Spain
. And she had a lot of 

valuables, because one of the things that we were not allowed to Œ to take out of 

Hungary 
was money. So we got valuables, so my mother had gold this, and gold 

that. My si ster had gol d. And m y 
mother madea mistake, she 
Œ she put the gold 
watch on me. And t he Germans looked at m y mother, and let her pass. Looked at 

m y sister, 14 year old with gold necklace, and some gol d armbands, and God 

knows, and the y had a few thoughts about  that one. B
ut w
hen they saw a gold watch 

on me, then when t he y decided that they weren™t going through, and a lot of this 

was confiscated at t he German border. Not confiscated, because Germans are Œ 

were 
[indecipherable]
 very honest, so the y Œ we gave them an address in 
Budapest

to send to somebody that we knew. There was a battle for this after the war, too, 
because 
after the war, he still had all of this, but he woul dn™t give it back. 
So  
Œ 

Q: So the Germans did send it back to 
Budapest
? 

A: Oh, the y were, in that sense Germans were very, very, very preci se, and very Œ 

Q: And you guys were traveling as Jewish people at this t i me? Your documents said 
you were Jewish? Do you know? 
A: Well, our papers didn™t say that we were Jewish. 

Q: Oka y. Okay. Okay. So, can you tell me a li ttle bit about the boat ride? How long 

did it take t o get to 
Mexico
? 
A: Well, we left 
Vigo
, between a t wo day stop in 
Vigo
, it too-took the better part of 

three weeks. It took 17 days, I think to Œ to get  to 
Havana
. In
 H avana
 we Œ in 

Havana
 we Œ 
we were 
taken off the boat and Œ and also t here was all  kinds of 
papers, and this and that and the ot her. And they sent you to an island in the Ba y of 
Havana
, called 
Trisko
(ph) 
Onus
(ph)
.It took me a year 
Œ several years, 20, to find 
out that the place was called 
Trisko
(ph) 
Onus
(ph). My mother kept refori Œ 
referring to it as 
Triskonia
(ph). We 
Œ we spent, I think two nights on Œ on this 
island, til t he y processed our papers. And t hen we were sent to 
Havana
, where we 

stayed for about probabl y 10 days, because you know, t h-the Œ the boats were not 

all at the same time, so you had to wait for the arrival of the boat. And this was 
a lib

Œ and the Œ and the boat which we had come to 
Havana
 with 
[indeci phera ble]
 is 
the 
Comillas
, The 
Compañía Transatlántica Española
. It™s a boat which survived 
the war, and was sti ll in service after the war, and the trip from Œ 
from 
Havana 
to 
Vera Cruz
 was on a boat Œ boat called the 
Monterey
(ph), which was quite 
luxurious. Even I could tell that it was not Œ not th Œ the regular Œ regular boat, there 
were Œ there Œ we had t he very Œ very ampl e cabin, very nicely furnished one. 
Everything was screwed down, but very nice cabin. And when we got to 
Mexico
, 
there was again the problem of processing all of this, and Œ and processing the 

furniture, pro-processing the 22 bags, and the papers, and Mexican customs were 

not exactly the fastest i n the world. So, actually, we arrived on the 21
st
 of April, and 
I think by t he fifth of Ma y, we were still in Œ in 
Vera Cruz
. And I wasn™t very sure 

about 
Mexic
o
. But then, the fifth of ma Œ 
May was m y birthday,soI suddenly see 
fireworks, and parties, and whatever it is, so you know, I figured it wasn™t such a 
bad country, if they celebrated m y birthda y. It was very ki nd of them to do so. But 

no, we were Œ in Œ i n 
Mexico
 we were definitel y known as Jews, we were Œ in Œ as 
a matter of fact, one of the problems was t hat t he Mexican i mmigration square, that 

piece of paper with a picture, said very clearly that we were Jewish. It had a 

religion. Except, you know, we got it in Œ in 
Lisbon
, so there was no Œ I re Œ I real ly 

wonder, I™ll t Œ I™ll take a look. I Œ I™ll Œ I™l l send you these Œ

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ co Œ I can™t give them to you because basically m y sister wishes to hold onto 

them for a while. But, i f Œ it can be Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ it can be given to you, after Œ after we™re no longer here. 
Q: Oka y, yeah, that Œ t hat would be Œ that  would be very int Œ 
v ery 
Œ 
A: But I can Œ 
I have a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a collection, st rangely enough, papers, and some 
pictures survived. Survived because m y mother took everyt hing t hat she Œ was 

inside. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And survived because m y cousin had a very, very nice landlady in 
Nitra
, in 

Slovakia
. So when she was sent t o Œ to t he camps, the Œ this woman kept 
everything. In fact, even after Œ after she wi Œ she Œ she got Œ she and her husband 
got into trouble with the communists, despite the fact that, you know, the y had Œ 

called heroes of the Œ whatever it is. My cousin™s husband was Œ 
became the head 
of the biggest pediatric hospital in Œ in 
Prague
. And there were other people who 
wanted the j ob, so he Œ he Œ he got  himself int o trouble with the communist 

authorities. My cousin as Œ as rebel  as she has been always, she went to get her 

licen Œ re Œ to be reli censed as a doctor, so they told her, well, to be relicensed, you

have to take a course in Œ in Marxi sm, Leninism. My cousin sai d Marxism, 
Leninism, what part of medicine do the y Œ do t hey specialize in? Of course, this 

didn™t go over very well, and they were also Œ they had to leave in a hurry, 

Czechoslovakia
 Œ except the y had a lot of friends there. You know, t hey were in 

the underground, so people in the underground told her, you Œ t hat the Œ that the 
secret service was Œ was being Œ looking for them, so the y Œ they left with a small 
bag in the middle of the night. But again, the people where they were living kept 

everything, including t he furniture. And Œ and you know, when these people in t he 

underground became minister of defense, mini ster of this, minister of that, the y Œ  

they actually sent a letter, sa ys why don™t you come back, at Œ at least to visit us. 

And the y came for a couple of months, and Œ but they were already well established 

in 
Israel
, and Œ 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: Œ they Œ they wouldn™t go Œ 
the y wouldn™t sta y.They 
Œ the y had a great ti me, 

they had good parti es, whatever it is, and t hen the y said goodbye.
 
Q: You said Œ you mentioned that your family had trouble because your Œ your 

visas, your Mexican visa said that you were Jewish. What sorts of problems did you 

have?  

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron   
 
May 8, 2013 
 
 
 
42
 
A: Well, I™ll tell you very truthfully, 
Mexico
 was a strange place at that time of Œ 
even though the y Œ the government  itself was very friendly, and didn™t care whether 
you were Jewish, or not Jewish, or whatever you were. The question i s, were you a 

refugee, or weren™t you a refugee? And even t hough we had come in not as a 

refugee, the Mexican government was, very, very friendly, and very open. There 
was a movement in 
Mexico
 at that ti me call ed the Œ the Mexican traditionalist 
movement. And this was heavily anti-Semitic. Basically t heir Œ the people who had 

been there earlier, had Œ had an awful lot of trouble, because Jews began 

monopolizing some of the downtown markets in 
Mexico City
, and the Mexican Œ 
th-the peopl e who had been in these stores, in Œ before, even though they sold out, 

they Œ it™s not that they were pushed out, t he y were sold out, they Œ 
they started 

bearing a resentment, and this traditionali st movement was very unpl easant. In ot her 
words, the y Œ they used to come to the boats, and used to have placards, and Jews 
go home, and don™t Œ we don™t need you, and this and that and t he ot her thing. Not 

only Jews, but the 
refugiados
, which mean refugees in generals, and t his was 
Spaniards, and 
Œ basicall y Spaniards. But Jews were also included in t he Œ there Œ 
there Œ there Œ there are some books about it. There™s actually a very interesting 

book written by a friend of ours. I can Œ I can let you have that too, eventually. It Œ 

it was called ﬁ
Momi ento Traditi onaliste Mexicano
,ﬂ and it had two generals as

head of it. And the y were very, very, very unpl easant. Instead of Brownshirts, the y 
had 
Camisas Parvilas
(ph), which is sort of a gra y, like a mousy gra y, but you 

know, it wa Œ they were inspired on the Œ on t he Brownshirts. B ut th-there was 

always, you know, in Œ in Œ in 
[i
ndecipherable]
 
Catholic countries, 
Mexico
 was Œ 
it was always a lay Œ latent anti-Semitism. But  for all its latenc y, never Œ never Œ 
never got over the age of the 
[indeciphera ble]
 it sta yed relatively in its place. And 
it Œ it Œ you know, m y father start in a place called 
Pueblo
, which was basically an 
extraordinari ly Catholic city. Su- Super C athol ic city. The reason for i t, of course, is 
that there was not Œ there were a lot of old Spanish residents there. Not Œ the new 

Spanish were communists and Socialists, and whatever it is. But the old Spanish 

residents were Œ were very traditional. As a matter of fact, the Spanish club in 

Mexico
 had Œ that time had a throne waiting for the king and queen t o come, when 
there was no queen and queen Œ ki ng and queen any more. And, strangely enough, 

they did get to use it when this man became Œ when 
Franco
 made this man king of 

Œ but curiously enough, the Œ the Œ there was Œ we Œ we Œ we never met up with too 

much anti-Semitism. 

Q: Oka y. From 
Vera Cruz
, did you go to 
Puebl
o
, where your father was living? 
A: No, from 
Vera Cruz
 we actually went t o 
Mexico City
. 
Q: Oka y.

A: My Œ 
m y f 
Œ m y fat her Œ m y mother especi ally, didn™t think very much of 
Pueblo
. We 
Œ we Œ  we lived in 
Pueblo
 for a while, because my father, you know, 
felt that somebody should be there. But they finally dis Œ th-there were several 
partners, there were three po Œ three or four partners. So, what happened is that each 

partner used to spend a week there. So basi cal ly they had one week in Œ in the 
month to spend 
there. Ma 
Œ m y mother tried at first, but 
Pueblo
 was a miserable 
town, it wa Œ it Œ it was very close. It was Œ you know, it was sti ll old 
Mexico
, it 
was the Œ 
t he place where 
Œ 
where women knewtwo 
Œ t wo Œ two roads in the ci ty, 
one from Œ from their house to thei r mother-in-law™s, and from their mother-in-
law™s to Œ to the market. That was Œ that was t he extent of their Œ t heir travels. It 

was very traditionalist place. But th Œ th Œ you know, it was basically like 
Hunga ry
. 
There was Œ  there was Œ 
you co
ul d sense i n the air, the anti-Semitism. But you Œ 
real Œ really, expression of it by violence, you didn™t Œ you didn™t see. Well, except 

for Œ for these 
Camisas Parvilas
(ph). But these were also Œ the y were not Œ they 

were not constant, t he y were intermittent. There was a man who was called the 

Mexican 
Hi tler
, 
Abascal
 Œ 
actually he™s 
Œ he™s Œ one of his sons became labor 
minister in the 
Fox
 administration. 
Q: Oh. 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

A: And, 
a 
very unpleasant person. I Œ I Œ I happened to know hi m and his brother-
in-law. His brother-in-law used to run a Œ a textile complex, like we Œ we used t o 
do. But the brother-in-l aw was not that unpleasant. I-It Œ it Œ what Œ I™ll tell you, the 

only violence that I had was, I was pla ying in t he park in 
Budapest
. By chance, you 
know, in 
Bud
apest
 you left your child, and you told hi m not to Œ not  to go too far, 
and just left hi m. So I was playing around, and two Œ two obviously hoodlums, or 

whatever it is, caught me and I don™t know why, you know, the y did say 
yo u
 Jew, 
you™re a Jew, this 
zsidó
, whatever it is. And one pushed me, and he managed to Œ I 

managed to hit a stone Œ stone Œ I don™t know what it was, it ma y have been some 

sort of a sit Œ place to sit on, or Œ and I had to get four stitches. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Luck Œ 
l uckily, the 
Œ the doctor was in the same building as we lived, so Œ  
Q: Yeah. And you didn™t have any experiences like that in 
Mexico
? 
A: Overt anti-Semitism, no. 
Q: No. 

A: No. There was, but i-i-if it was, it was among the Œ the wealthy there. It Œ it was 

again Œ again, a strange place. If you went to t he real high, conservati ve, old 

Mexicans, t he y Œ t he y fell in love with 
Adolf Hitler
. They Œ in fact, they used to 

have oil pai ntings, and Œ of 
Adolf Hitler
 in their homes, and oil paintings, which 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

46
 
once in a while show up in antique shows Œ shops today in 
Mexico
. And it was 
strange, because you know, at Œ it  Œ 
Hitler
 used to occupy the place of the Virgin of 

Guadalupe 
in t he home. In other words, t he Œ his place was above the mantle, and 

whatever it is. Fortunatel y, Germans were not Œ you know, didn™t think very much 

about Mexi cans, you know, the y were just  one chain below Œ bel ow whatever the y 
Œ they liked. So, I happen to know a lot of people, and especially i n t he German 
school system, at 
th
-that ti me, before they cl osed it down. The man who had 
actually run the German school in 
Budapest
 was running the German school in Œ in 

Mexico
, and Œ and he had been very friendly. As a matter of fact, there was another 
couple of Jewish boys which had been in 
Budapest
 as well, which li ved in 
Mexico
, 
and this man wanted us to go Œ go Œ all go into the German school , because he 

needed the native German speakers, and coul dn™t find them in 
Mexico
. So, my 
mother didn™t want to, and the Mexican government was helpful enough in closing 

down the Œ  the Ger man school, because the embassy was Œ was pla ying games. But 

it was amazing to me, because th-t he Mexi can kids were handled very badly by the 

Germans, you know, with Œ no matter what their social condition was, the y were 

really treated like second class citizens. Curiously, we were not. I mean, we were 

there maybe for a week, or two weeks, or what ever it is, but we were not Œ not 

treated like Œ like second class cit izens at all.

? 
A: This is in 
Mexico City
, which Œ  
Q: Oka y, uh-huh. 

A: Œ which, you know, if you look at it in the Œ in Œ in the distance, it was strange, 

because the Œ the man i n 
Mexico City
, the ambassador, was a out  and out Nazi. 
And th-the person i n charge of the embassy, who had been somebody living in 

Mexico
 was an out and out Nazi. And he didn™t seem to bother us, but he Œ he 
bothered the Mexicans, and the mother Œ t he mothers used to come cryi ng to the Œ 

to the direct or, sayi ng why do you treat my child like that? And the y kept sendi ng 

the children back, instead of taking them out, until the government finally closed 

down the school, and there was no Œ but it  was, you know, like the American school 

later became the place t o send your child, the German school were Œ for example, 
Octavio Paz
, the Œ the Mexican di plomat and author went  to a ger Œ t o the German 
school, to t he 
Alexander von Humboldt 
school, and so did a lot  of intellectuals, 

along Œ in the 1940s, a lot of intellectuals went  to the German school. 

Q: Oka y. And you said you spent about a week or two in

Pueblo

Mexico City
,and m y mother
 did the same wa y. She wouldn™t 
live in

and
 then to live in

, she decided she wasn™t going to live in

A: Well, m y sister, first of all, she Œ she had only t wo years to go. And she had Œ 

she Œ she Œ  she knew some English. In ot her words, m y Œ m y mother had Œ had 
gotten somebody t o try to teach at l east my sister English. I was j ust l istening. And 

m y sister spoke reasonably good English, and she wa Œ went al most i mmediately to 

the American school.

A: I went t o a publ ic school for a while, until my mother was told by everybody that 
she was getting me just  Œ lice on me. That, you know, I shouldn™t do this, and I was 

taken out, and I was put into a Œ 
a 
Œ a mili tary school, Mexican Spani sh, ru-ru
n  by a 
former Jesuit. And I stayed there til  about t he sixth grade, seventh grade, and then 

m y sister convinced my mother that I Œ I should be educated in the 
United States
, 
so I, in junior Œ in juni or high school I started going to Œ to the American school 
myself.
 
Q:Oka y. Were you or 
Œ did your family learn Spanish while you were Œ 
when you 

were in school? Did you learn Spanish? I guess you had t o? 

A: W
ell, I™l l tell you very t ruthfully, I Œ I Œ I didn™t speak for about three or four 
months, and then suddenly I broke out spe-speaking Spanish; m y sister likewise. 

My mother, she didn™t speak good Spanish, but she managed. My father was not a 
linguist. He never quite spoke Spanish, but I was always surprised that the workers 
knew exactly what he wanted. And you know, this was mechanics, t oo, I mean, he 

explained t o them, you know, a complex piece of equipment, that Œ what he wanted 

to do with it. I didn™t understand a word of what he said, but the mechanic knew 

exactly what he Œ in ot her words, everybody seemed to meet halfwa y. In other 

words, m y father™s Spanish was understood by the Œ the Mexicans he was dealing 

with, but i t was Œ he Œ 
he managed quitewell
, actually. He traveled all over the

country, and you had t o Œ you know, you had to buy agai n, raw material. Wool was 
difficult to get from 
Australia
, you could get i t, but it was the Œ difficult those war 

years.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So he Œ  he used to travel all over 
Mexico
, buyi ng up wool locally, which was 
also in competition wit h various existing Œ exi sting companies. It ™s Œ actually, that 

was the only Œ the only anti-Semit ic problem t hat the y had. They had Œ there was an 

Œ an establi shed Spanish company called 
España Industrial
. And they were 

making mone y head over foot, and I mean, they were sending, for about nine 

dollars, something which cost them a dollar to make, or a dollar-
fift y to make.And 

m y father, since he knew the trick of using waste, was undercutti ng t hem, 

underselling them, so one day he was called into this Spanish company™s whatever 
Œ offices, and was told that either he sold at  their same price, or the y will put hi m 
out of business. So my father said, you know what, I™ve Œ I™ve just escaped fro
m 
Œ 
from worse than that, and you know, try, and see who Œ who Œ who is out of 

business first. They were out of business before we were. I-It™s Œ th -th -there was 

latent anti- Semitism in 
Latin America
. In Œ in Œ in 
Argentina
, i t™s bad. In 
Mexico
 
it was latent. There Œ there were some fantastic stories. For example, i n 
Pueblo
, 
there were a l ot of Germans. And there was a hotel of all things, called the 
Ritz
, in 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron   
 
May 8, 2013

downtown 
Puebl o
. And on Friday nights, the German col ony used to close down 
the Œ the hotel™s dining halls, lock the doors. They used to dress t hemselves up i n Œ 
in Nazi uniforms, and used to sing the 
H orst Wessel
 song, and t hings like that. Real 

Œ real Nazi. There was never in Œ i n 
Mexico
, despite some people who were try to 
mak e 
Œ make it up, there was never a Œ a real Nazi movement in 
Mexico
, look like 
Œ like 
Argentina
, 
Bolivia
, and ot her places. Th-There Œ there was a lot of Nazi 
sympathy, but very, very, very little Œ curi ousl y, t he Japanese were m ore active in Œ 

in Œ in Œ in 
Mexico
. They Œ they destroyed several bridges on the western part of 
Mexico
. The y Œ our competitor, one of the reasons we were able al so to slow hi m 
down a litt le bit is that he had no compunctions of selling to the Japanese, and there 

were several Japanese submarines that Œ that came out to Œ 
tobuy hi s merchandi se. 

He had na Œ  Americans wouldn™t l et him i nto t he 
United States
 after the war. And 
basically, where you used to get machinery, and raw material was t he 
United 
States
, so Œ so he had a very serious problem. That helps h
i m 
Œ put hi m i Œ put hi m 
out of business. Overt anti-Semitism, you know, actual violence, no. 

Q: So would you say that your i mmigrant experience in 
Mexico
 was defined more 
by being a European, or more by being Jewish? Were you able to find a Jewish 

community, a European community, or Œ 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

A: Well, I Œ I Œ we were a little bit lost in the Jewish community, too, because there 
was a very big German community, it was call ed 
Ev uno
(ph). And there were a lot 
of people who Œ who had had troubles wit h Nazis, especially socialists. The Œ the 

former head of the socialist party i n 
Germany
 was Œ 
was in 
Mexico
, he 
Œ he 
became a photographer, and that™s what he made a living on. But  for a while, he 
was working with the Mexican government, especially with the soci alists in 
Mex
ico
. But there were a lot of Germans. There was 
Frank
, and the Œ Dr. 
Frank
, 
there was hi s Œ his grandson became health minister in 
Mexico
, and t here Œ there Œ 
there were a l ot of Œ there Œ there were a lot of German Jews there. One of the Œ the 

grandsons o
f one or Œ other one, became the Œ the environmental mini ster of 

Mexico
. And i-in Œ  je Œ  we Œ we Œ we were Œ we were more at ease with the 
Germans than we were with the Poles. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: My father had learned Polish l ate Œ late in l ife, and so had m y mot her. And the 

few Jews who Œ all the Œ the Jews that came from 
Poland
 
were very 
Poland
 
oriented, which my fat her and mother Œ they used to go because, you know, it was 

one way of socializi ng. And the Poles had an own Œ their own cl ub, and the y used 

to get together once a week just to speak Polish. So m y mother used to go, m y 

father used to go. But t hey were uncomfortabl e there too, because t hey Œ  the y were

not Poles, they were Œ 
th ey 
Œ they Œ their al legiance was closer to Russian Jewry 
than the y were to Polish Jewry. The y were closer to 
Bialystok
 Jewry, which was 
not Polish, but rat her Russian. But we Œ we mingled with them all . We used to go to 
the Œ to the Ashkenazi shul, the Ashkenazi  synagogue
 
in downtown 
Mexico
. Then, 
since all the Jews left downtown 
Mex
ico
, the y installed t hemselves not far from 
where we li ved, ma ybe 10 or 15 minute walk. And that™s Œ we went t here for a 

while. My father di dn™t  like it, and curiously, one thing that he Œ he didn™t like also, 

were these Hassidic Jews. But he Œ he and the Hassidic Jew bought a property, and 

made a synagogue for t hemselves. But it was basically Œ you know, m y father was a 
traditionalist. He di d beli Œ not bel ieve in Orthodoxy, but traditional Orthodoxy. 

The Œ the Hassidi m were rather southern Œ southern Polish. They came Œ most of 

them came from around 
Kraków
.This man was 
Œ I don™t remember which ra Œ  
rabbi he was the 
[indecipherable]
 of, but the rabbi™s center was 
Kraków
. And 
southern 
Poland
 and northern 
Pol and
 at that time, were different worlds. One was 

Œ had been 
Austro
-
Hungary
, the other had been 
Russia
, so, you know, the y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ there was nothing to speak about , but the y got along quite well there. And th-
t h e y 

Œ he liked traditional things, and th Œ the Mexi can community was Œ was torn, it 

was either Sephardi m, or Ashkenazi m, and Ashkenazim so often 
were 
v ery 

religious, some of them were not religious at all.

Q: Yeah. 
A: There was a lot of 
Hashomer Hatzai r
. This was, as I said, t his was on Œ a 
v ery 
serious problem. My mother woul dn™t send me to a Jewish school in 
Mexico
 
because 
it was run by 
Hashomer Hatzai r
. And you know, as they say, you know, 
two Jews make three political parties, and this is a Œ this is basically what was 
happening, it was Œ but  it was an i nteresting life, it was Œ you know, the Œ 
some 
people were traditional , they Œ the y Œ for example, the park close to the synagogues 

where we were, on Sat urda y morning there were circles of, you know, whatever it 

is, socialists, communi sts, or Œ and they were having all kinds of discussions there, 

it was Œ 
it was 
Œ it  was an interesting time to be there. But Mexicans really didn™t  
bother us very much, you know.  

Q: Oka y. Did you at all become involved in Mexican life? Did you make Mexican 
friends, or Œ 
A: Mexican?  

Q: In mexi Œ did you make friends with any Mexicans? School friends, or Œ 

A: Oh, very close ones.

A: I lived in 
Mexico
 from 1941 ti l 1996. 
Q: Oh wow. Okay. 

A: So ma Œ I got marri ed here in 
New York
, m y wife is an American, a New 
Yorker, but she Œ she came to 
Mexico
, she lived there for 35 years. 
Q: How did you meet her, 
[indeci pherable]
 business? 
A: My sister™s mother-
in

law,and m y mother

Q: Oka y. 

A: And well, you know, it was a Œ it was a nice girl that they want ed me to meet, 

and she was a nice girl.  

Q: One of the things she wanted me to ask you was about your last name, where 

your hyphenated last name came from.  

A: Well, m y 
Œ 
m y 
Œ I had an uncle. His name was
 Louie
, and he was recruited int o 
the Russian arm y, a-and the Russians, you know, wanted to convert, and m y Œ 
m y 
Œ 

 
Interview with Samuel Marein -E fron

m y uncle was not very religious, but he wouldn™t convert. So the y Œ t he tsarist 
officer gave hi m every dirty job i n Œ imaginabl e, and he took it very kindly, unti l 

the da y that the officer got really mad, and he horsewhipped him. I mean, there was 

probably a foot and a half difference between he and the officer, but he grabbed the 

horsewhip, and started horsewhipping the Œ the Russian. Of course, he didn™t even 
stop for a clean shirt at home, he got the Œ he went to 
Königsburg
, from 
Königsburg
 he went t o 
Lo ndon
. He li ved in 
England
 for four or five years, and 
then he moved to the 
United States
. But the Œ 
the memory stayed with theRussian 
arm y, and Œ and you had to conscri pt yourself into the army. The only way that 
you 
could get yourself out of the arm y is if you were an only son, or t here were no Œ no 

Œ no other Œ 
well, only son,
 meani ng that if Œ if there were no other children, or t he 
other sibli ngs were women, you could be ex
emptfrom military servi ce.So m y 
father did this, he had a Œ a cousin by the name of 
Efron
, who had two daughters. 
So when he had to go i nto the arm y, and he figured that he wasn™t going to be 

treated very well, and he didn™t want to go Œ 
I mean,let™s be
 honest about it, he had 

hi mself apar Œ 
adopted by this 
Efron
. 
Q: Oka y.

A: So, since he was already in business, you know, it™s li ke m y daughter. My 
daughter is a doctor, so she keeps her maiden name professionally, and so the same 

thing happened here, except you had to merge the two. 

Q: That™s a very int eresting story.  

A: Anywa ys, if you can later give me a card, I™ll try to send you at least first of all, 
copies of papers, and all kind of Œ 
Q: Yeah, yeah, no, I wi ll. I™ll send you an email this afternoon with Œ 

A: Oka y, t hat™s fine. 

Q: Œ the information in it. I had another questi on for you. When did your family 

find out what had happened to the Jewish community in 
Europe
, and what was that 
like?  

A: Well, we all Œ we al l basically found out about 1944, when I t hink the ﬁ
New 
York Ti mes
ﬂ published a whole story. But it wasn™t only that, but you know, there 
had been an awful lot of deportations, and these deported people never showed up 

again. Of course, after t he war, everybody started looking for Œ for everybody, and 

they found that there was nobody left, practically. We know that my aunt, uncle and 

cousin, were deported t o 
Treblinka
. It sounds like m y cousin was kill ed before he 

ever got to 
Treblinka
, because there was a Œ  t here Œ the people who Œ who took the 
Œ who were put on the t rain from 
Bialystok
 to 
Treblinka
, were Œ there was a

rebellion, and I think my cousin was involved in that. After the rebelli on, the y were 
made to walk to the Œ t he rest of the distance, which was not Œ not Œ not a Œ in t he 

[indec
ipherable]
 considerable amount of Œ and a lot of people di dn™t make it. But it 
seems m ycousin was 
Œ  was Œ was killed before Œ before. But my aunt  and uncle 
were Œ the rest of m y fami ly managed to survive, because t he y were i n 
Russia
. 
Q: Mm-hm, okay. 
A: Or, the y had left 
Pol and
. I mean, basically, my father was the sole support of his 

father, and the sister, who was the mother of my cousin, and a brother who didn™t 

stay very long, he Œ 
he helped
 m y father for about 10 years, and then he went to the 
United States
 about 1912 or ™13, or somet hing like that. So basically we have no f 

Œ no Œ no Œ no i mmediate family i n 
Europe
 at that ti me. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y were either in 
Israel
, or t he 
United States
, or Œ or 
Russia
. And the ones in 
Russia
 didn™t Œ t he y di dn™t all survive. You had two uncles in 
Leningrad
 
who died 
in the Œ in the siege. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But I don™t know, we Œ we Œ we were very adventurous sor-sorts. I think one of 

m y aunts had a chil d, and she decided that, you know, the child shoul d be a rabbi. 

But how can he be a rabbi in Œ 
in the
 
[indecipherable]
? He had to be a rabbi in

Israel
. So she Œ one day, she disappeared. Her husband didn™t know where she 
went, nobody knew where she went. Years l at er, somebody said that they had seen 

her in 
Jerusalem
. And 
as a 
Œ we Œ we have Œ we have some very, very Œ 
well, you 
know, the Œ it was an adventure to be a Jew, and people were very adventurous. 
Q: Excellent. 
A: We had Œ even my father™s oldest brother, who was a rabbi, first went to 
Sweden
. Couldn™t make a living being a rabbi. Put up a hat factory, and I think 
wouldn™t make a Œ a living with that either, so he went to the 
United States
, and the 

United States
, hi s wife didn™t like it. So he went to Œ to Œ  to 
Israel
. And he lived 

quite well there. He Œ 
he 
Œ he Œ he was one of the founders of the 
Bezalel
 

movement, of the art movement, and he was the Œ he became an anti quarian. 

Q: Oh, mm-
hm.
 
A: And, as a matter of fact, there were three generations of antiquarians in 

Jerusalem
. And my Œ 
m y 
Œ the Œ the Œ the last one, the cousin, anyway, she Œ she Œ 
she had also a very strange life. But she left me some of the stuff that she had in Œ in 

Œ in the store, and she Œ she had a lot of stuff, she Œ she ha Œ 
she was aspecialist in 

real Ottoman art, and she was considered one of the top specialist s in Ottoman art. 

She was al so slightly nuts.

A: Well, there Œ there Œ there Œ there Œ you know, there Œ there are a lot of little 

things, about how our friends managed to get out, often didn™t get out, some of them 

stayed there. My father, later on hel ped some of the technicians that he had at the 
factory move to 
Canada
 in 1956. And you know, it became Œ after Œ after Œ after 
the war, everybody was helping everybody. For example, m y father sis Œ this rule 

that you had to have 20,000 dollars for a famil y, or 10,000 for an indi vidual, people 

that had 
it, th
-they rec ycled this mone y. In other words, t here were Œ t here were, 

you know, they were presenting as if this man had 20,000 dollars, you see. Only 

wanted to see the deposit, and that was it, it was Œ they showed t he deposit, the Œ 

the mone y wentto somebody else, or 
Œ so, you know, the Œ the Œ there was a Œ 
a 
really Œ I wouldn™t call it an underground movement, but an over-
ground movement 
to Œ to meet the legal Œ the legal restrictions. Because the 
United States
 really 
didn™t open up til about 1944. My father event ually got his immigrati on papers, but
