Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
 
Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Jacob Wiener
 conducted by 
Esther Finder
 on October 
25
th
, 1998 in 
Silver Spring, Maryland
. This interview is pa
rt of the museum™s 
project to interview Holocaust survivors an
d witnesses who are also volunteers with 
the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on 
Jacob Wiener™s 
post-
Holocaust experiences. In preparation for th
is interview I listened to the interview 
conducted with the 
U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, 
and we did two of them, a 
video on June 30
th
 of 1994, and an audio th at wa
s received by the museum on 
February first of 1996. And you also di
d an interview with the Survivors of 
Shoah
 
Visual History fo undation on October 17
th
, 1996, and I reviewed part of that also. I 
will not ask you to repeat everything you sa
id in that interview, instead I will use 
this interview as an opportunity to follo
w up on those interviews
 and focu s on your 
post-Ho locaust experiences. This is tape number one, side
 A. 
I want to thank you 
for doing the interview with us today. Ca
n you tell me what is
 your name, and what 
was your name at birth? 
Answer: Presently my name is 
Jacob Gerd, g-e-r-d Wiener, w-i-e-n-e-r
. And 
formerly my name was 
Kopel
(ph) 
Gerd Zw ienizki, z-w-i-e-n-i-z-k-i
. 
Q: When  did you change your name and why? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
4
A: Changed my  name as part of the natu
ralization in 1951, I 
believe, and the reason 
was that time I was married, my
 wife didn™t like this name, the all different kinds of 
pronunciations, and my  brother al
ready had ch anged his name to 
Wiener, w-i-e-n-
e-r,
 and I told the judge at 
that time that the reason 
I™m changing my name to 
Wiener 
is
 
because 
Zwi e n i zki
 is very hard to  pronounc
e, very hard to write. And 
just like a herring, wh ere you cut off th
e top and the bottom, the tail and the 
[indecipherable]
 so I cut off the 
z
 and the 
icki 
and it remains
 wien. 
But I wanted a 
two syllable name so I made it 
Wiener. 
Q: We™re going to ask about your immedi
ate post-war experien
ce. I would like you 
to tell me h o w you learned that the war was over. 
A: I learned it from newspapers and I also
 learned it from talking to people who had 
been in the Holocaust, who 
knew about th
e Holocaust 
[indecipherable]
  
Q: What exactly did you learn from talk
ing to those people who were there? 
A: During th e war, I was on Œ i-in the begi
nning of the war I was still in contact 
with relatives of mine in 
Germany
, I wrote them letters and the letters came back. 
And from the contents of the letters I kne
w that it was going worse Œ from worse to 
worse Œ from bad to worse, because they wr
ote this person is not here any mo re, he 
went on vacation. What they
 meant by this of course was went to concentration 
camp. After awhile I don™t hear from the peop
le at all, letters came back censored,

or no letters came back. This went on ever
y year. Every year I wrote a little article 
for myself about hopi
ng th at the war would end. We
 went out to  the different 
organizations and Œ to
 find out if the war could be 
ended, but there wasn™t mu ch 
response in that respect, and so it went on
 til the end of the wa
r. In 1945 the war 
ended, and many demonstrations
 were held and people ta
lked about this and they 
[indecipherable]
 and they heard about this from other people. 
Q: You were in the 
United States
. How did the American media present the news 
of the war and what had happened to the Jews? 
A: It™s unfortunate that the media here in the 
United States 
didn™t
 
write too much 
about it, a-and if 
they did, like the 
ﬁNew York Timesﬂ
 they wrote it on a Œ not on a 
main page, but wrote it on pages afterwards
. It™s Œ the only tim
e when they wrote 
the things on the first page was during 
Kristallnacht.
 And afterwards they didn™t 
write it on front of the pages. I read the pa
per, of course, and while I read the paper, 
I also learned English mo re
, and Œ and I can only say th
is, you see, that when  the 
war started I was registered in class 
4-D
, which was clergy going to school, because 
I went to the 
Yeshiva
 and they were exempt from ac
tually joining 
the war, even 
though I tried to join the wa
r and Œ but the only thing wa
s at that time, either buy 
war bonds, or I even tried to join the war by being an
 air raid warden, but after 
awhile they told me, you cannot be an ai r raid warden , I was considered an enemy

alien, despite the fact th
at I was Je wish in the 
United States
, and I always had to 
get permission even  to 
travel, let™s say from 
Baltimore
 to 
Yonkers,
 where I had a 
little shop,in 
Yonkers. 
Q: What was reaction of the Jewish commu
nity around you to the news that was 
coming out of 
Euro pe
? 
A: The Jewish community. A-After the wa
r? After the war, about 1945, 1940 si Œ 
1946, I left the
 Yeshiva
 in
 Baltimore
, the 
[indecipherable]
 
Yeshiva 
Rabbinical 
college, I left them. I g o t 
semicha
 there and I talked about 
this, they tried to help 
Jews in
 Europe
, they  send out packages
 to them, they send out
 packages and then I 
tried to find people from my birthplace to
 whom I could talk 
and who maybe knew 
more about what happened 
at my  particular place wh
ere I was born. And I found 
people, I found people in
 New York.
 There was some people in 
New York
 by the 
name of
 Greenburg
(ph). I talked to them 
what had happened in 
Germany
. I also 
talked about other people, I went to orga
nizations, like Œ had a big demonstration in 
Madison Square Garden.
 They had the em Œ demonstr
ations all over, and bringing 
people e Œ over, and many people came  over 
afterwards, but they had not actually 
been in the Nazi concentration camps per se
, they had, during the war they had gone 
from 
Germany
, 
Russia, Poland 
and so  forth to 
Shanghai
 or into  other places. And 
they came over. And then 
[indecipherable] 
and other people came over.

Q: I have a couple questions about what
 you just said. You 
said you left the 
Yeshiva
, you got 
semicha
 there. Can you explain wh at that means? 
A: 
Semicha 
means like ordination to be a rabbi. 
At that time, the rabbi at the 
Yeshiva 
was Rabbi 
Ruderman, 
who had come from 
Lithuania
 just before the war. 
In fact, his wife was born in 
Königsberg,
 was east
 Prussia,
 part of 
Germany
. And 
it Œ and it was not Œ there were not too ma
ny people Œ during th e war, of course, the 
number of students at the 
yeshiva
 increased and after the war it went down. At the 
end of the war, especially
, I tried to become a 
United States
 citizen . Already during 
the war I tried to become a 
United States 
citizen. In 1943 was the first time I made 
an appeal to become an American citizen
. Now at that time, the immigration policy 
was that you had to have first papers, a
nd after first papers you have to wait five 
years and you can make an 
application to become a c
itizen. So, when
 I made my 
first application 1943, I was asked to come before a board in
 Baltimore, 
five 
different organizations, the navy, the Œ the 
war , the defense and so forth. And it 
was Œ it was rejected because at th at tim
e the war was Œ looked
 very bad because 
the Nazis had been stopped at
 Stalingrad
 and it was very bad, so they didn™t want 
anyone to become a citizen unless they ac
tually went to war. And later on I made 
the application, think around 1950, 
though it might be earlier, with the 
FBI
 to go for 
translations. So they said, if you want to 
make translation, we have to send you to

Germany
, I didn 't want to go to 
Germany
, so I stayed here. 
But they helped me 
also in Œ to get my  second papers, and I 
got them in, as I said
 before, in 1951.  
Q: And that™s when 
you became a citizen? 
A: Then I became a 
United States
 citizen, and as I menti
oned before, I changed my 
name at that time. And I was already marri
ed then, because we 
married in 19 Œ got 
married in 1948.  
Q: Is your wife also a su
rvivor of the Holo caust? 
A: Yes, my wife was born in  
Nuremberg
 and she moved to 
Firth
(ph). And they 
were living there and the Œ her father was 
a merchant, he had Œ th ey  had a business, 
and Œ and of course like all peopl
e at that time, tried to leave 
Germany
 after the 
Kristallnacht
, which I consider the beginning of
 the end. Everyone knew th at it 
would not change any mo re a
nd they had to  leave. Before
 that time, we also had 
tried to come out of 
Germany
, but I don™t want to talk 
before that time, but only 
say that they finally, in 1939, that™s 
before the war, she came out with the 
Kindertransport
, children™s transport to
 Eng land.
 And their parents also came out, 
because they had some relatives in  
England.
 I had also tried to come out with the 
transport, but just on the date when 
I received the permission to come to
 England, 

they stopped it.

Q: I wanted to go back to 
something you said a few mo ments ago, ab out being at 
magison Œ 
Madison Square Gard en Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ with  
[indeciphera ble]
. Can you tell me  ab
out that event? 
A: It was a big crowd in 
Ma dison Square Garden.
 Th ey mad e man y  
[indecipherable]
 meetings. But, as I understand it now,
 you see, and as I read in the 
newspaper and so fo rth, there were alwa
ys requests of people to come to the 
United 
States.
 They Œ at Œ at that time, in  order to come to the 
United States
, 
[indecipherable]
 you needed  a Œ what™s called a certificate Œ 
zertifickat
. And th ere 
were only a certain numb er of 
zertifikats
 available per year for people from 
Germany
, because a number of 
zertifi ka t s
 had been set in nine 
[indecipherable]
 
that time, and at that time 
the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ I mean
, the type of population in 
America
 was different than it was in 1940 and 1950. So , many people got 
certificates but they  were only dated for two 
or three years later. And who wanted to 
wait two or three years? We didn™t want to
 wait two or three years. We didn™t have 
an American certificate, even
 though I know from my r eco
rds, and my mother, that 
she had Œ my  father had 
applied to go to the 
United States 
already in the 20™s, but 
my  mo ther didn™t want to go becaus
e she had all her family in Œ in 
Germany
. So 
that™s why we stayed there.

Q: I™d like you as an eyewitness, to tell 
me what was going on in that protest at 
mad i s Œ
 Madison Square Gard en .
 If you could describe 
the scene and what was 
said, and Œ and the feelings
 that the people had.  
A: I don™t know any mo re exactly what went on th ere. I can only tell you it was a 
very big meeting. Yo u see, the
 Ma dison Squa re Ga rden
 has a very big place and it 

was filled up to capacity. And there were
 many people who sp oke about it, what 
happened  in  Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Germany
, and wh at could be done and they wanted  to Œ 
they wanted to influence the 
American govern ment to do 
something about it. In that 
respect, I mean a little
 bit to the side, 
when I was in the 
yeshiva,
 there was a young 
man, he was young at that time, who ca
me every week, ever
y Thursday to th e 
yeshiva
 and from there he went on to 
Wa shington 
to  discuss with cabinet ministers 
to let Jews out. And his name was 
Michael Trist
(ph), and the person he talked to 
that was discussing, 
Moshe Sherer
, which recently passed away, became the 
president of the 
Agudath
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
 organization. But every week they 
came out. And some of the 
yeshivas
 and some of other organizations made it, but it 
was a very tough time because the 
United States
 was interested Œ and it is not 
against the
 United States, 
the
 United States 
was interested to win the war. If we 
win the war, then everything
 will change. So we cannot
 bomb the trains to the 
concen tration camps. And they  heard the person, 
Jacob Rosenheim, 
I have his

book here, and I heard him speak many times
, who le Œ sent letters, and I have the 
copies of the letters which he sent to 
Roosevelt
 and other people to do this. Only 
one person was successful to
 a certain extent, a limited extent and it was
 Ruth 
Gruber
, I don™t know if you heard of he
r, who arranged  with Secretary 
Icke s
 and 
Morgenstern
(ph) and so forth, they arranged 
that thousand Œ that they permit a 
thousand Jews to go to 
Oswego
, one of my family, and we also went to 
Oswego. 
In  
Œ that™s in the Œ
 Oswego
 is near 
Lake Erie
, I think, it™s in the state of
 New York. 
So they  did very many things, so th e people came over and th ey were protesting and 
they were writing and they were talking to
 in-influential people. But it was not the 
mood at that time. It was just Œ in fact, th
ey never felt that anyt
hing bad happened to 
the Jews, and it could be changed, until 
Kristallnacht.
 I think by 
Kristallnacht 
it 
changed, because that 
was the first time that
 Roosevelt
 called his ambassador from
 
Berlin
 away and talked to hi
m about what happened.  
Q: When  the war was over, and you said y
ou had read articles, not on the front 
page, about what had happened to  the Jews
. I would like to get a sense from you of 
what the Jewish communi
ty in the Œ in the 
United States, 
religious or secular, 
whatever you can share with me, what wa
s the reaction of the Jewish community 
and Œ and was there much sa
id by the Jewish community? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
12
Q: Many think that, and it was not always
 positive, unfortunately, because when I 
came and the whole family came in, alr
eady before the war, in 1939 to the 
United 
States
, to
 Montreal 
we came, before we went to 
Montreal [indecipherable]
 
United States
, there w ere in Œ in the community
 there were mone Œ mo stly older 
people and they could not believe it that it 
was as bad as it really was, even if we 
told it to them, you see, they could not be
lieve it. And we were considered even 
when we came to the
 United States
, refugees, an-and it Œ an-and considered 
refugees. We were called greenhorns. It™s
 completely different now, when the 
Russian Jews came over, and they were accepted as 
[indecipherable]
. We were Œ 
we be Œ came there with on
ly four dollars from Œ from 
Germany
, which we could 
take out, four dollars. This was 10 marks 
at that time, 1 0  marks was four dollars. 
And even  when  I was in 
yeshiva
 I had to canvas that Œ that we put clothing, other 
things like this, doctors, or medical servici
ng and so fo rth. We were not considered 
actually as it was, as b ad as it really wa
s. They  did not think it was as bad as it 
really was.  

Q: How long did it take for Œ for you or
 the people around you to  grasp the full 
extent of the genocide, just how many peop
le were killed? How long did it take for 
that information to come across? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
13
A: You must know that everything wh ich 
was done by the Nazis was done secretly. 
And that™s why people still denied if afte
rwards. And that™s also why many people 
didn™t know about it until very much Œ b
ecause, as I menti
oned before, in the 
beginning we did Œ we did re
ceive some correspondence, but afterwards we didn™t 
receive correspondence. Ev
erything went Œ I don™t kn
ow how it came over here 
[indecipherable]
 channels, small radios, because 
they had no television here. It 
came out slowly after the war, it came out, even
 so set Œ so far that last year when I 
was in 
Germany
, I heard certain things which I 
didn't even know happened during 
the war. You see, even now, 50 years late
r, 60 years later you see, there are certain 
things which had never been publicized 
and which only come out now. It™s 
unfortunate, you see, when  so mu ch in se
crecy that people couldn™t believe it. It 
was unbelievable, it™s beyond belief what happ
ened there, that a 
Œ such a thing in a 
Œ a highly civilized, scientific co
untry should happen like this.  
Q: How closely did you follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials? 
A: At that time there w as already television,
 I think, 1946 and we tried to see Œ look 
at the Œ look at the television, find out wh at ha Œ what was going
 to happen and we 
saw other people there. But in my  impressi
on, I mean the impression of mo st people 
was 
[indecipherable]
 that these people were so brainwashed, or crazy, or wh atever 
you call this, you see, saying th at I had no
th ing to  do with it because I followed

orders. Same thing was when they killed 
my mother also, they said, we followed 
orders. But they did not have their own mind,
 they just said th
ey followed orders. 
Of course, the wo rld knew by th at time 
that they could have done something 
because they had power and th
ey had all the authority to 
do what they wanted to do 
and they  didn™t do it. And not only this, 
the worst thing of it, that they in-
intimidated the whole populati
on to do this Œ to go in 
the same way. That no one 
actually acted freely on his own free will.  
Q: Did you follow the 
U.N.
 vote on the partition of 
Palestine
? 
A: Yes, we followed it very closely. It 
was in November and we followed the vote 
and it took some time to find that 
the majority vote came out about 
Palestine
. That 
was going on fo r a long time, because it actu
ally started long be
fore the war. In 
1936 with the British, you see, were not 
too happy and were not
 too much in favor 
of Œ of it at all. And they  even  Œ many pe
ople died because they tried to go th ere by 
force to 
Isr ael, 
to
 Palestine
 at that time. They couldn™t
 land, they got sent to the 
concen tration camps in 
Crete
 and other places. But before
 the Œ this, we saw them, 
that finally came through. We were very 
mu ch  ap Œ surprised, especially that 
Russia
 voted for it. But of course no Arab
s, they voted  for it and they never 
acknowledged it. And to this 
date, no one blames them for 
anything, but they  really 
do because they never 
voted for it. For them
 it doesn™t exist.

Q: Let™s take a break and see if we can 
get Œ stop th at background noise. All right, 
we™re back now and I had been as
king you about the partition of 
Palestine
 and I 
wanted to  get a sense of you Œ from you, of
 what was going on here in the Jewish 
community with respect to the par
tition and the birth of the state of 
Israel.  
A: The entire Jewish commun
ity here, as far as I know and I saw, was very much 
interested in wh at was going to  happen, because many Jews ha
d already gone to 
Palestine
 at that time, and they did not feel safe in
 Palestine
, and they did not know 
what would happen, the 21 Arab states
 would be poised to Œ to break
 Palestine
 and 
not to have peace with them, you see, ev
en though the Jewish community  in 
Palestine,
 and I know that, offered any person, 
whatever nationality, whatever sex, 
whatever religion, to stay 
there and they would live in 
peace. But there was so much 
hatred and unfortunately we s
till have hatred in the world,
 that they said no, don™t 
stay there, go out, because th
ey will kill you. They  did not have in  mind to kill you, 
just now 
[indeciphera ble]
 in mind to kill anyone.
 Not as, number one, not 
[indecipherable]
. And they went out and they  made
 the concen  Œ they made these 
refugee camps, in which they are existing today, and th e
 U.N.
 supported it. I went to 
the 
U.N.
 when the 
U.N.
 was, at that time meeting.
 They were meeting already 
before 1945, the 
U.N.
 went in, and wh at would happ
en there, they saw people 
standing Œ people standing outside and ther
e was Œ this is Œ was Œ o-other people in

there, beca Œ all the people wanted peace. Al
l the Œ they want to
 live in peace with 
other people too, but they just co
uldn™t. As I mentioned many times, in 
Germany
 I 
mentioned it too, the mo st pi
ous person cannot live in pe
ace if the wicked neighbor 
doesn ™t want it. That™s one German cita
tion, that the German
s made  themselves. 
Schiller
(ph) made it. His poem.
 So we were very much afra
id that we would not have 
peace, but we all very much wanted peace.  
Q: Did you every consider making 
aliyah
 and going to 
Isr a e l
, sp Œ 
[indecipherable]
 at that time? 
A: I know many of my  family went to 
Palestine
, but I can tell you that already ye-
years before that, in 1933, when  
Hitler
 came to power, already 
in that ti Œ at that 
time they had what they called 
Hasharah. 
It means preparation for. And I 
participated in one of such
 groups. However, like all the 
Jews, my mother especially 
thought that things were changed and th e 
neighbors, our neighb
ors, our non-Jewish 
neighbor 
[indeciphera ble]
 things were changed. And who knows what it is starting 
in a new life and so forth. I wanted to go 
there, we learned already Hebrew at that 
time. But at that moment 
when Œ when this happened,
 the partition happened in 

1948, at that time I was in the 
United States
 and my  Œ my  father was in 
Canada
 
and he did not have too 
mu ch Œ he did not make too much 
of an effort at that time to 

go to 
Palestine, 
even though we had family in 
Palestine
 at that time, and I received 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener

17
[indecipherable]
 from
 Palestine,
 but at that time it was not settled yet

Q: After the birth of the state, there 
was the Œ the war, and there have been 
subsequent wars. I-I wanted ad
d Œ to ask you to share in 
the insights or any thoughts 
you had during these c
onflicts, particularly with your
 life experience, knowing what 
war can be, and knowing fear as a Jew, I 
was wondering if you had any insights that 
you could share about 
Israel™s
 wars. 
A: First I want to say that the Jewish pe
ople were always against war. We want to 
try to settle everything by peace as
 much as possible, even if it™s 
[indecipherable]
 
unfortunately. But I rememb er one instance
, I think it was the Œ the war Œ the Six 
Day War in 1967, I think. And at that time I was Œ I had a job in 
New York
 and I 
went to a co nven tion in  
Mo n t real
. We had Œ and my father™s family was living in 
Montreal
, and at that convention we had a mee
ting and at that meeting there was a 
great British journalist, I think Lady jo Œ 
James
, I don™t reme mb er her name. 
Anyhow, there was a vote. Who votes for
 Isr ael
 and Œ that they sh
ould win or that 
they should be Œ should be 
peace and who votes against 
it. Every person voted  with 
Israel
 that isra Œ that 
Israel
 should have peace. Only 
one person voted no. And th ey 
asked this one person why no, they  said
, there should never be a comp lete, 100 

percent vote. There should always be one Œ 
besides, then they asked the question, 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998

what can we do in order to make peace he
re? Well, there were all different answers 
and one person, this Lady
 James
 gave a very interesting answer, she said, we 
should build a wall, 
like they have the 
China
 wall Œ Chinese wall between 
China
 
and the other things. They had another wall 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Berlin 
wall. So we 
make a Œ at that time they 
were all interested in maki
ng peace by building walls. So 
they had the intention, this
 lady says, you make a wall between the Israelis and th e 
Arabs. Of course it never happened, but th at was the psychology and the Œ th e ideas 
of the people at that time, you see that they
 might think Œ that they think by making 
walls, you can make peace. Just like during 
the war, you see, when
 the French  made 
the
 Maginot
 line, they thought 
with a wall they can 
[indecipherable]
 the peace and 
the Nazis just walk around. 
And that was an interesti
ng idea she had. Then of 
course there were the other wars 
[indecipherable]
 but when the Œ the Six Day War, 
you know, when  they  suddenly  saw that
 the Jews were winning and there was a 
euphoria and they went in th
e streets with big bed sheets
 and you collected money, 
everything was okay, but unfor
tunately, this a mistake fo r the Jewish people, they 
did not see what they  could have done at th
at time, if they had done it at that time, 
we wouldn™t have trouble now. Fo r instan
ce, at that time the whole west thing, 
everything was okay. At that tim
e they started to call it the 
West Bank.
 Before they 
didn™t call it even the 
West Bank
. It was 
Transjordania
, it 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
19
Jordania
 was Œ was separated between the east,
 the west and th-the whole thing 
about 
West Bank
 and 
East
 
Ba nk
 and who knows wh at? These terms wouldn™t 
came up there Œ the other word s which were going on between 
Israel, 
there was 
always a trouble Œ they  were always afraid
 the Jews would win. 
And th ey did win in 
some 
[indecipherable]
 at that time when the 
[indecipherable]
 and they captured 
all of the 
Sinai
 peninsula and they even had 
Arafat
 surrounded. They did not do 
anything with him, they let them all go 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know if the others 
would have done this if they had cir-cir
cled Œ encircled the Jewish people and so 
forth, they  would not let one person le Œ go
 out alive. But that™s what the Jewish 
mentality is. 
[indecipherable]
 they don™t understand this here. 
Q: The comment that you just
 made with respect to the 
Sinai
 and the encirclement 
of the Œ that™s the ™56 war? 
A: It was the 
Suez 
canal. And I want to say only one thing, it could have been  
peace, and this was Œ and I remember this, you know, 
Golda Meier
, who was the 
prime minister at that ti
me, she made peace with 
Sa da t
. C a u s e ev en  
Sa da t 
had 
fought the Jews, but they made peace 
on the basis, and that™s why she 
[indecipherable]
 she said we both have grandc
hildren and we don™t want our 
grandchildren to live through war. You see, 
so Œ so th erefore there is some point 
where you can bring people together. But yo
u can only  bring them together Œ they

mentioned 
Germany
 too, if you learn from the past. We have 
[indecipherable]
 
grandchildren who Œ in the future
, so have to learn from that. 
Q: How closely did you follow the 
Eichmann
 trial? 
A: At that time again, we followed it by ra
dio and by television and we were very 
mu ch surprised that they found him, be
cause he did not identify himself. Only 
afterwards they found out about it. And then it was 
ORT
 and television and a-all, 
and we heard all the reports wh ich were do
ne. It™s unfortunate again that one person 
[indecipherable]
 he should not have been execut
ed, but Œ well, I don™t know, you 
see, because he executed th
ousands and hundred thousands
 of people, he is one 
person. He was guilty, that™s all 
[indeciphera ble]
 but again, to the last minute, he 
denied th at he was responsib le. He denied
 his responsib ility. People don™t want to 
be responsible. I did by Œ by orders. But 
that was his order, because he was one of 
the three or four people at the
 Wannsee 
conference who made the decision of the 
final solution.  
Q: Did you feel justice was done? 
A: I think there was done justice, you se
e. Even though we say Œ even though the 

Jewish religion they say God is the final 
judge, you know, God 
is the final judge, 
but Œ and justice will come 
eventually and it did come 
eventually because the war 
ended and 
Hitler
 did not achiev e what he wanted to achieve, so he was the final 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
21
judge, but at that moment it was in the ha
nds of the human court,
 with the majority 
of mankind at that time, because everyone 
was involved. So therefore, I think there 
was justice done, to that extent. 
Q: We™re going to pause, and I™m 
going to  flip the tape. One mo ment. 
[break] 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Jacob Wiener
. This is tape number one, side
 B. 
And I wanted to now continue in th e 
60™s, you had just told me about the 
Eichmann
 trial. The 1960™s were 
very turbulent in the 
United Sta tes
 and I would 
like some insight from you on how you re
acted to some of wh at was going on 
around you. Specifically, let™
s start with the Civil Righ
ts movement. Do you have 
any thoughts on that? 
A: I never felt any animosity, so to say, to
 anyone who was not Jewish or any other 
kind of color, because 
even in school in 
Germ any
, I had a black person, at that time 
they were called Negroes, in my  class, 
and he came from a former German colony 

in east
 Africa.
 So I Œ I always tried to reconcile 
people and to  try to Œ to understand 

other people™s views. Now wh en this happ
ened with the Civil Rights movement, of 
course when I was working in the 
department of Social Services in
 New York,
 we 
had also many people who were different 
colors, Orientals and other people of 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
22
different colors and I was always ve
ry good with them, and never had any 
problems. So, besides this, I rememb
er when they had this march to 
Selma
 there 
was one Jewish person who was killed, 
Schwerner
(ph). And 
Schwerner
(ph), we 
knew his father, who had a wig fam 
Œ a Œ a business of making wigs, 
sheitel
, in 
German. And so  we knew about this, you 
see. Again you see, here you see that 
there were Jewish people who, as some 
could say, with what happens to other 
people and not just saying it like you know
, many times people say yeah, we have 
symp athy, but they  deserve it. No, not that
 way. A-And try to have and try to  see 
what it was. So we had the 
symp athy with them also, and th Œ because Œ because a 
number of Jews, especially Jews, are very 
symp athetic to all kinds of people. They  
have this kind, what you call this 
[indeciphera ble]
 hearts. Emotion with other 
people. It doesn™t necessarily mean we Œ we
 Œ we have to leave our religion or our 
whatever we believe in, but we also ackno
wledge what others believe in, we don™t 
fight them because of th
ey™re Œ they are different in certain respects.  
Q: You mentioned that in 
Germany
 you had a classmate who was from 
Africa. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to have him in the class and 
what the reaction of the other students was to this individual? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener

A: In the beginning there was 
really no difference. Under the 
Weimar 
republic, I 
mean before 
Hitler
 came to power, they made 
no difference between them and 
them, even though 
Weimar 
republic said every person has a right to live his way. 
This person was okay. I don™t know wh at ha
ppened to him afterw
ards, but I™m quite 
sure that when 
Hitler
 came to power, he had gone back  by th at time and I don™t 
know what happened af
terwards. But I only 
know that during th
is time, it was a Œ 
because it was an organization in 
Germany
 during th e 
Weimar
 republic which was 
called 
verhein
(ph), means a-an assembly, a grou
p, for Germans in the foreign 
countries, especially in the 
Austria
, 
Czechoslovakia
, where the Germans were the 
bordering countries, here was such kind
 of an organization and they  wanted 
everyone already in the 
Weimar
 republic, they wanted everyone to join this 
organization and to work for them. In other 
words, they already wa
nted at that time 
to include them into 
Germany
. They were not hiding like 
Hitler
 did, to conquer 
them and make them part of 
Germany
, but th ey were just like supporting th em, 
because they were livi
ng at the outskirts of 
Germany
.  
Q: This country had gone to war with 
Korea
 and th en ag ain with 
Vietnam
. I was 
wondering if you had any insights that 
you could share about wh at was Œ wh at it 
was like for you to watch this
 country now go to war. 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
24
A: The unfortunate thing is that after th
e World War II, which is now of course, in 
Germany
 
[indeciphera ble],
 it me ans war of distraction, because that was the 
whole purpose, more so than winning 
the war. At Œ more Œ many more wars 
happened. Like you say, the war in
 Ko rea
, the war in 
Vietnam
 and now even  other 
wars in 
Bosn ia
 and all over the world 
[indecipherable]
 situation in 
Africa
, all 
these different things which happened af
terwards. But that was the Œ and age Œ I 
mean, the 60™s were some kind of Œ it was 
a rebellion, it was rebellion of the youth. 
And I saw it myself because there wa
s it Œ in my  department, when the 
commissioner gave a talk, a group of peop
le came, stopped him from talking and sat 
in front of him Œ sat in front of him, you se
e, so that he couldn't talk any mo re, and 
talked against him. No respect
. I mean, that was Œ that is
 actually the beginning of 
making peace. The first Œ the first thing about
 peace, when you have to re Œ respect 
for each other. And honor what other people 
say, that™s a real democracy. This was 

what 
Freud
 calls civil disobedience. That means 
they Œ they wanted
 to show their 
own force, their own selfishness, their ow
n pride by saying I know mo re than you 
do. That happens with Œ I mean, it happened
 in schools too, that children Œ an d my  
wife knows about this, that the children 
many times will see Œ accuse teacher of 
something which they 
want to be the boss 
[indecipherable]
 be in charge. You see, 
if people don™t wo rk  togeth er with each othe
r, you see, that™s what I always try to 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
25
do, as I me ntioned before, with the black 
people. With other people, if they don™t 
accept this and the resp ect to other people 
Œ respect other people and Œ and listen to 
other people, at least listen to them, you se
e, then we cannot have any peace. So I 
was always Œ I didn™t really understand 
the anti-war movement at that time. O f 
course, we shouldn™t have a war which ther
e is no purpose to it. But the government 
itself, you see, didn™t have a key purpose of
 wh at they really wanted to  do, and 
therefore it™s Œ it™s no wonder that the peop
le themselves didn™t
 know what to do. 
Q: I™d like to ask you about 
Œ you mentioned children and 
Œ your wife and children. 
What kinds of things did you tell children 
about your experiences before you came 
to this country? 
A: I told the children then 
and I™m telling the children no
w Œ and I wrote about this, 
I™m telling the children to gr
ow up in a country where 
you don™t know what™s going 
to happen to you, they
 make laws against th-the Jews, they make law against other 
things, the first thing is you have to know
 what you want to do,
 you have to know 
yourself. You start with kno
wing yourself and th
en you will either
 Œ you cannot be 
everything, everybody 
[indecipherable]
. So th erefore I say if you want to be a Jew, 
you have to know what it me ans to be a Je
w. If you want to be someone else, you 
have to know wh at Œ wh at it means to be  someone else. But you have to know what 
you want to be. Because you cannot talk to 
other people if you don™t have a point of 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
26
view of your own. So  it Œ when  I wrote 
the children and I was man y  asked to talk 
about what it means 
to grow up in 
Germany
, and I was many times asked, what do 
you think ab out things which are going on in
 th is world, I say, we cannot have all 
the answers, and I studied psychology, we 
cannot meet on the Œ always have all the 
answers, but we have to  know one thing, th at
 we have to  have one
 point of view and 
sometimes we don™t know the an Œ we don ™t always know the answer, you see. But 

then we have to have a belief, a faith 
[indecipherable] 
I have the faith in God, and 
finally he will make the final decision. I 
don™t know, we make Œ made decisions and 
it would not happen that way. We had Œ we Œ 
we always thought, you see, that i f we 
make this kind of treaty, 
we™ll have peace. No peace 
came though. No, we Œ we 
don™t always know the decision, but finally th e decision were made 

[indecipherable]
. Just like I know that when
 Chamberla in
 before the war, by the 
mun Œ 
Munich 
conference came back with an umbr
ella and said, we have thousand 
years of peace, that what he thought, you s
ee. But I don™t know if he ever believed 
it. If you say something and you don™t believe it 
[indecipherable] 
tell the truth, 
then nothing will come out of it, that™s wh
at I say. That™s why 
I told the children, 
you have to learn some thing 
about yourself and you have to go to school, you have 
to Œ education is the most 
important, now we all know it in
 America
 too, education 
is the more important. It™s Œ it™s more
 important than learning about war 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
27
[indecipherable]
 education, because if you have
n™t educated you don™t know how 
to Œ wh at kind of decision to make and wh
ere to go. And it also finalize Œ it also  
sensitizes a person to  what it means, how to live with other people. 
Q: I wanted to ask you about some of 
your writings. And spec
ifically if you had 
some favorite themes that 
you revisit in your writing. 
A: Favorite themes? W h en I write certain 
stories and so on, I make people beli Œ I 
bring out Œ I like to, I intend to, I don™t 
know if I™m always su
ccessful, I intend to 
find out in Œ in Œ and Œ and impress upon th
em that, as I said before, we have to 
know wh at we want. And Œ and I know ther
e are two types of people who came out 
of the concentration camps, two type
s of people. Don™t want to be 
[indecipherable]
. You see, the one type of people
 wh o came out and said, if God 
lets this happen, where is 
God? And another t
ype of people came out and they  said, 
I cannot believe anyone and I only  believe in God. So just two opposites. And we 

see this here in the 
United States
 nowadays, we see that many wh at we call 
bali-
chuva
(ph), that means people 
who returned to Jewish 
[indecipherable]
 many thing. 
And we see on the other hand that people 
say, I don™t want to believe that. And I 
wrote about this. And Œ and Œ an d I say, if
 Œ if a person doesn™t at least have one 
goal or one mo tive by which to go, he 
gets lost. And many people committed 
suicide during the war, afterw
ards, because they 
Œ they didn™t know what was going 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
28
to happen  and th ey co uldn™t believe it. Fr
om the Jewish point of view, it is an 
[indecipherable]
 sin to commit suicide, because we have Œ we are not the masters 
of our ow life, and that™s why suicide 
is forbidden because our life was given by 
God and therefore we cannot take it away
. He Œ unless He takes it away, you see. 
But Œ but that™s the story.  

Q: Do you have some favorite works or 
perhaps a favorite poem that you would like 
to share? 
A: Yeah, I have here two th ings which 
I like to tell you. Wh en we first came to 
America
 in 1939, and I must say that every step
 in my life was a miracle, and that™s 
what I want to write about, and every person
 has miracles in his life, everything was 
a miracle. It was a miracle that we came 
out, that we came out this way. Even the 
killing of 
Ernst v om Ra im
(ph) on 
Kristallnacht
 was also a miracle because up to 
that time, the number of Jews emigra
ting had declined , a
nd this Œ many Jews 
emigrated after this happened,
 who otherwise would have 
died in the concentration 
camps. So I don™t know Œ you see, everything
 is a miracle. But when I came out of 
Germany
, I wrote of it. This is a poem, and I 
only want to read the last two lines 
because how happy we were to come to the 
United States
. It goes like this, ﬁLand 
of future, our future, everything we brin
g to you. Seeking re
fuge we are coming. 
That is all we have in view. To be treate
d in your country, duties, rights, like you, 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener

29
the same. Not despised, distained, detested
, that™s our honest aim. Continent of 
mankind™s future, world of sun and hope. Far off war and scenes of 
[indecipherable]
 on the western 
semi-globe
(ph). God bless you. From a land of 
terror we were forced to flee. God bless you
 America
, you, the land of the free.ﬂ 
Q: Is there another piece of work th
at you wanted to Œ to share today? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 briefly and this is in answer 
to the people wh o said, why did 
this happen to me? And what do the vic
tims say? The victims say, I may be alive 
and many are not alive any more. ﬁWhat wa
s our guilt? We were born a Jew. We 
are weak and helpless and only a fe
w. We pray to you, God, to 
[indecipherable]
 
the 
Shema
 for you, we accept our death. The k
illers rejoice with a stone filled heart 
to see us defenseless p eople depart. Y
ou will judge them, we
 know, for their 
horrible crime to kill us all. You will pay 
them in time. The Jewish people will not 
disappear as long as we to you are near.ﬂ 
Now, that was what the victims said. Now 
what do the survivors say? 
The survivors say, ﬁHow can 
we forget the Holocaust? 
Yes, some survived, 
although millions were lost. We
 survivors will never forget 
their pain. We™ll cry out to the world, ne
ver again. To you God, we belong fo r 
infinity, because you have never fo rsak
en me. You knew what would be our 
destiny. Only we cannot fathom your heav
en ly scope, but we™ll never lose love and 
fear and hope in you, who has the power 
and might, you who work  in justice and

right. You left us alive. We were saved to 
narrate our brothers and sisters indescrit Œ 
indescribable fate. For the world mu st kno
w what the Nazis contrived, and th at it 
was God by whose love we surviv ed.ﬂ 
Q: You seem to have an ability to explain 
to people about your experience, either in 
poetry or in some of the other written wo
rk  that you™ve done, and some of your 
written work is in the file available at 
the mu seum. Do you have any advice or any 
guidance for survivors who would like to 
Œ to speak to their children or their 

grandchildren and find it difficult? 
A: Yeah, I sometimes get people who talk 
to me and who™ve said they cannot talk 
to their par Œ to their child
ren because their children are 
different. Some children do 
not want to hear about what  happened there. But I ca
n tell you one thing, wh ich I 

know from my  work  as Œ on psychology and 
in the department of Social Services, 
that I have found that it™s very difficult, of
ten, not always, to talk to the children, 
and it™s easier to talk to grandchildren. 
And I found this out in three respects. 
Numb er one I found it out when  I was 
working with child abuse, what was 
[indecipherable],
 that the children of Œ who were a
bused didn™t like to talk to their 
child Œ to  their parents because they didn
™t want to make them feel ashamed or 
responsib le. But the grandchildren want
 to know, they ™re a little bit further 
removed. Nu mb er two, I found 
out we had some relatives in 
Russia
 and my  Œ my  

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
31
brother once went to 
Russia
 and he spoke to  them. And then some grandchildren of 
ours, from my  Œ my  Œ my  uncle™s grandc
hildren came and they wanted to know 
about Communism and things like this. Th
e children didn™t talk about Co mmunism 
to their parents, the Œ on why and what, but 
the grandchildren did. Then I also have 
this here Œ this Œ I worked with
 AAA, 
alcoholic anonymous, so
 the children don™t 
want to talk about it to their parents, beca
use they don™t want to
 picture their parents 
as alcoholics. But the grandc
hildren want to get into 
[indecipherable]
. And the 
same is also true with the Holo caust expe
rien ce, that most of the time you see, the 
children don™t want to hear 
about it. They hear
 so much about it,
 it™s too much. But 
the grandchildren are free, mo re free and th
ey want to hear about it and they  Œ many 
times, an-and that™s why, for 
instance my  Œ my  wife didn™t want to write any book 
or anything like this for her children. 
Yeah, now she writes it for her children 
[indecipherable]
 the grandchildren. 
[indecipherable]
. I think eventu
ally they will 
hear it, you see, but it takes a long time. 

Q: I™d like to ask you some questions a
bout your volunteer work at the mu seum. 
And I™d like to know specifica
lly what do you do at the 
U.S.
 Holocaust Memorial 
Museum. 

A: All right. We moved to 
Silver Spring 
in 1988. When
 I came here I had a job 
already right away with the 
Montgomery 
county to give a course on th e search for

identity by the famous 
Victor Frankl
. It™s an omo Œ i-it™s called Œ
 Victor Frankl.
 
And then I also tried Œ I Œ at that time th
e mu seum was just forming, it had an office 
on 
L
 or
 M
 street in
 Washington, D.C.
 and I was going th ere and talking to Miss 
Morgenstern
 and additional people of the museum, I was talking to them about 
this. But they were not organi
zed yet, so I just let it go.
 Then I Œ I didn™t want to 
take a job there, I just wanted to see if 
anything could be done. I was talking to them 
to Œ to the one in charge of the library
. And then I started to beco me a regular 
volunteer when  it opened up in  1993. Even  
before that I was 
already a volunteer. 
And in the first year I was also on the 
volunteer advisory board . On e time I Œ I was 
a little bit Œ for a little while 
I was chairman, but then 
[indecipherable]
 two years, 
then you have to go out and I didn™t want to
 Œ because you can only stay at wa Œ at 
Œ on the advisory board for two years, then you have to  
interrupt one or two years, 
but I didn™t want to do it any mo re, no time.
 So what happened is now I™m doing 
three things at the museum. Number one 
a visitor representative, which means on 
the floor doing all the different things wh
ich should be done, wh ich are necessary 
on th e floor, about information and passes, 
elevators, all kinds of things. Nu mber 
two, I™m with the 
Fannie Mae 
organization 
[indeciphera ble]
 about taking groups, 
leading groups around, you
ng childrens in their teens,
 junior and high school 
children. And then after talking to th
em for two hours or so leading them

[indecipherable]
. Then number te Œ three, I™m
 in the speakers™ bureau. And 
speakers™ bureau, they  have different person now, 
John Minnick
. I went and I 
talked to the Œ different things. I also 
talk Œ I was asked by 
other organizations, by 
the Catholic University and by 
Fort Meade 
talked i-in
 York, Pennsylvania
, in 
White Port,
 
Virginia
. 
[indecipherable]
 remember what the difference is, and 
talked 
[indecipherable]
 you see, I just talked ther
e. But I only talked for a few 
minutes, let™s say for 20 minutes, 30 minutes 
the mo st, 20 minutes and th en they  ask 
questions. But as we see, I showed them th
e list and when I talked at this school, the 
high school, I was surprised that after 
the school was finished, after school was 
finished, people came and they stayed and 
they asked more questions. That™s what 
I™m doing now and I also Œ I also brought to th eir attention th at it was 60 years now 
after the Holocaust and to do
 something ab out it, they didn™t want to do anything in  
the beginning, but now it seems to be 
[indecipherable]
 doing something about it, 
you see. So I just got to all the different people 
[indecipherable]
 will also give a 
luncheon and I think it™s a luncheon 
[indeciphera b le]
 the mu seum in January  next 
year, about certain
 experiences in 
[indecipherable]
 
Kristallnacht. 
There are many 
things in 
Kristallnacht
 which I didn™t know and I ha
ve the documents there and I 
have some books which I found in
 the library only last week.  
Q: What special insights and talents do you
 bring to your work  at the mu seum? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
34
A: I don™t know if there™s any talent, I don™
t know is there any insight. I think it™s 
just the willingness to Œ people should know 
certain things and Œ which to Œ which 
is very hard to get to it Œ i Œ a different
 way, you see. You have to have your 
contact, you have to know wh at other peop
le want. The only thing is like Œ like you 
say in social work 
[indecipherable]
 you see, the mo st important thing of a person is 
be able to listen, listen, you see. And so  
I try to listen to the other people, I don™t 
always talk 
[indecipherable]
. But I mean, in general it™s 
Œ it™s the attention, it-it-it™s 
mainly to listen to other people, to unders
tand what they  mean by that, and if not 
you ask them. And it™s Œ it™s the mo st im
portant, I think, and people should ask 
questions. You cannot always have the an
swers because there are more questions 
than answ ers. 
[indecipherable]
 it™s more question than 
answer. But it also says 
[indecipherable]
 the Bible says, and too in th e Talmud that
 
you don™t ask 
questions, you Œ you ca
nnot learn. So you see, you 
have to ask the questions and 
when  you see something, you ask the questio
n, why is this happening, why is this 
not happening. And not to be
 so bland and disregard wh at™s going on around you, 
that don™t have anything to 
do with you. You cannot live 
in this world, I tell them 
many times, as one person. You can only live 
with Œ you mu st have other people to 
live. What would you do if you would be
 only one person? Who is going to  bake? 
Who is going to  
[indecipherable]
 Who is going to Œ to br
ing you from one place to

another, transportation and so fo rth. So  we 
need all our other people too. Everyone 
has a job in this world, and we must all wo
rk together. And we must all believe that 
we are not the final 
[indecipherable]
 and we™ll be judged even tually.  
Q: Can you tell me some of your special
 experiences or special mo ments that 
you™ve had at the mu seum? 
A: I Œ I Œ I once Œ I was working in the 
Œ in Œ on the Œ in Œ in the information 
section 
[indecipherable] 
two times I had people coming over and tell me Œ tell me 
something about this, so I to
ld them Œ and they came from 
Germany
. I Œ because 
they need ed  someone to speak
 German to them, so they called me over, so I spoke 
to them. So inter Œ and was very interesti
ng. This one person, she was a student in 
history, and the other one was in 
Œ working in the German embassy in
 Tunis
. It just 
so happened that they
 wrote me, they knew that I would be in 
Germ any
, they 
telephoned me from
 Tunis
 to 
Brem en
 and they excused them
selves as they could 
not come. See, I don™t like to start conve
r Œ correspondence with
 others, you see, 
but they  wrote me. So that was one instan
ce and th ey wanted to see me and they 
wrote me, by th e name Œ the name of 
Schroeder
, that I think they are related to the 
president Œ president of wer Œ 
Germany. 
So  
[indecipherable]
 works in the 
embassy. So then I had, another time I ha
d the wo man coming over and she said she 

was very depressed and she said, we were living in th e 
zargabeit
(ph), the 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
36
Zw eibrücken
 and it™s between border, French  bo
rder. And at that time in 1936 Œ 
™36? Yeah . They  had the 
plevisute
(ph) wh ether they want to come to 
Germany
 or 
not. So  they  decided to come to 
Germany
 because
 Hitler
 made so much 
propaganda there. But she said, we were al
ways good friends with Jews. My fath Œ 
my Œ my father used to deal with Je
ws and my  Œ and we
 always had good 
relationship. And then afte
rwards, when we joined 
Germany
, then they called over 
my  husband Œ her husband and they asked 
him what did he do with the Jews, you 
see? Why do you still keep contact with th
e Jews. I didn™t understand exactly what 
she said, if he committed su
icide or wh at he did. Bu t anyhow, after she came back 
from the Œ going th rough th e mu seum, she came back to me and she said to me, I 
don™t want to see all this. In other word s, 
she said, I don™t want to rememb er all this 
because it gives bad memories back to 
me. So people come over sometimes an d 
they tell you certain things. There are ma
ny other things, but you hear any other 
things. You sometimes see people who you
 haven™t seen for years. Sometimes 
people come Œ I met people from 
South America 
who Œ who met Œ who knew 
someone of ma Œ my  cousin  who lives in 
South America
. You see, i-it Œ all kinds 
of experiences. It™s very interesting there 
if you are on Œ on th e Œ with the public, 

you know? That™s wh y I went with the pub
lic, and I could have done translations 
upstairs if I wanted to, but this is more interesting for me.  

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
37
Q: Have their been any special moments 
where your experiences as a refugee and 
survivor have Œ have had an impact 
on the students who come in through the 
mu seu m? 
A: Yes, I mean, when I talk to them and 
they want to hear mo re about it and Œ and 
some people call me back and th ere is so
me  impact, but I Œ I don™t know actually 
how mu ch impact it is, I only in Œ I only ca
n say that wh en we 
finish the rounds, 
you know, I sometime s ask people to write
 out the comment Œ the comment cards, 

you see, and Œ and th ey write out the comme
nt cards. They write out certain things 
that gave them mo re insight and they woul
d like to hear more ab
out it. It has some 
insight, but directly I cannot point to any 
particular theme, you see. There are Œ it 
certainly makes an impact on th em, and th
e people come Œ to mo st of them. To 
mo st of them, I cannot say to all of them
. Especially children 
who, I would say who 
are more than 15 years old, because if th
ey are less than 15 year
s old, even th ough 
the mu seum says 11 years can come, you have
 different types of people. Some have 
Œ are very intelligent 
[indeciphera ble]
 some only become intelligent at 15, it™s all 
different grades.  

Q: There has been a resurgence 
of interest in the Holocaus
t. You have been in  this 
country since before the war was over. In your experience, what
 do you think has 
accounted for this resu
rgence in interest? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
38
A: It Œ it took a long time to Œ people here in the 
United States
 and all over really 
found interest in the Holocaus
t. In the beginning no one wa
nted to talk about it. And 
I know the people who come from 
Germany [indecipherable]
 don™t want to Œ to 
buy German goods, and things of this so
rt. After the years go by, people can look a 
little bit more in unbiased 
[indecipherable]
 peace and rest about what happened 
with us, and people want to know 
more about their past in hitl Œ in
 Hitler™s
 time. 
You see, everyone had one ha
d to  rate Œ write a Œ what 
is called a family tree. And 
in the 
United States 
I think it came about wh en 
Ha ley
 wrote his book on roots and 
people want to know who™s really my fo
refather, who are really my people before 
me. And I think this had some influence here
 that people want to know more about 
it and the children want to kno
w more about their family. It
 could be an Œ an d they 
learn a little bit about it in school, more th
an before. It™s unfortunate that in 
Mary land
 it™s not compulsory  to teach the Holo
caust. But I know they have five or 
six states, li ke 
New York
 is one of them. And maybe 
[indecipherable] 
to the 
education 
[indeciphera ble]
 where it is compulsory to ta
lk about the Holocaust, not 
only in five or six lines like they have in
 the social studies book, much mo re about 
this an-and learn about things, see. How 
people should live with each other. Human 
history. And that™s why very  im
portant, you see that people like 
[indecipherable]
 
we talk about the Holocaust, you see, we 
try to learn about it, we like to make 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
39
people aware about what happened and wh
at can happen if the Holocaust and 
especially the second ge-generation, they sh
ould know 
about that 
[indecipherable]
 
they doing a good job.  
[break] 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Jacob Wiener
. This is tape number two, side
 A.
 
And I had been asking you about the resurg
ence of interest in the Holocaust, and I 
wonder if you th ink that the Œ the Holo caus
t Museum itself has had some role in the 
resurgence of interest. If 
the Holocaust Museum itsel
f had some role in the 
resurgence 
[inaudible] 
A: Okay , you also asked me about how I feel  about certain things. I already told the 
Holocaust Museum there are certain thin
gs which I don™t feel are correct. For 
instance, certain people, you see, certai
n people who had the 
experience and so 
forth, should be used to do some research
 in certain areas and 
Œ and I found th at Œ 
that the Holocaust Museum is 
more interested  in certain f
acts, not Œ they would hear 
mo re about the emotions from other people, you see 
[indecipherable]
. Of course, 
when  you have emotions, you may not always
 be neutral, but there is no person in 
this world who is a neutral, 
you cannot be neutral in th Œ 
in Œ in th Œ in your mind 
[indecipherable]
 wh ere it says you can be neutral in facts, you see. So for instance, 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
40
I 
[indecipherable]
 to them that they are Œ they
™re preparing people who have 
studied from books and every book has a 
certain bias. Because you can have 10 
books and you have 10 certai
n points of view in 10 certain books. You cannot be 
full of bias. Of course, the survivor, or someone 
[indecipherable]
 also has certa in 
biases, because what he went through. But hi
s personal bias is Œ is actually what he 
learned during the Holocaust, 
I mean what the experience
 in the Holocaust, what I 
experienced or others experien
ced during the Holocaust, so 
[indecipherable]
 so 
therefore I say, if you™d send so meone out to
 visit concentration camp s for instant, 
you know, many survivors don™t 
like to do this, because th
ey want Œ don™t want to 
have a second experience. But the people 
wh o go there with a professional degree 
and book knowledge, they 
may not know which questions
 to ask, proper questions. 
And that™s why I said to them many times th
at Œ that I feel you should at least send 
one person also from the Œ from those Ho
locaust people, you see, the sur Œ 
survivors and th ey should 
bring out their Œ their emotions, wha Œ how they feel 
about it. I feel about certain things, you see, feeling is not 
[indecipherable]
. And 
that™s one thing. And th en Œ then , like 
I, you see, I don™t feel too comfortable in 
maybe saying ev erything which is there, 
but you cannot always
 Œ you don™t know 
who the other person is, how th
e other person would take it, if I tell them from my  
own inner heart, you see, how I feel about 
it. So I don™t honestly know th at, you see, 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
41
but I don™t want to insu lt the person on Œ 
and things like this. 
But Œ but let™s say 
when  I lead the groups around, you see, I te
ll them how I feel about it. And I tell the 
other people who I Œ how I feel about it. An
d I don™t always know if this is the right 
way to say or not. You should always sa
y your Œ your feelings. If you have very 
strong feelings about it, like I had about 
Œ as I mentioned to
 you before, about 
people can come out and th ey
 say they don™t believe in God any mo re, you see, now 
I have the strong feelings about this. But 
Œ and na Œ once happened  when  I Œ wh en 
someone has invited me in 
New York, 
psychologist, a friend of mine, he asked me 
to talk about what happened during 
Kristallnacht.
 I couldn™t say it, because it Œ I 
was Œ it was too much for me, I co uldn™t say 
it. I do cry. I couldn™t say it. So there 
are certain times, in certain
 instances which made the greater impression on you. 
Makes a great impression. I didn't vi Œ didn™t 
want to talk about the Holocaust, what 
happened to me, but after aw
hile I said to myself, the 
world must know, you see, 
like the book says. And, so
 therefore I said I would 
[indeciphera b le]
 about it, and 
so not everyone may like it, but that™s what 
it is. I hope only that 
we gonna have this 
hatred any more and this ki
nd of terrorism, and this ki
nd of anti-Semitism, because I 
experienced anti-Semitism very earl
y in class, in Œ in school.  
Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism
 in this country after the war? 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
42
A: No, not really. You see, there is alwa
ys some subtle anti-Semitism which, if a 
Jewish person advances or so, there™s al
way s so me an ti-s emi 
Œ Semitism in the Œ 
and why does he do this, and 
Œ and why does he deserve 
this, and why doesn™t he Œ 
there is alw ays some anti-Semitism,
 
but I cannot at this point have to think about it, 
find out special incidents. There are always
 certain incidences when  you see it. I 
mean, I don™t know if this 
is anti-Semitism, because that
 the Jews were considered 
enemy aliens during the war, I don™t know 
if that™s anti-Semitis
m. So I don™t know. 
But, that we were considered like refugees
 and looked down, that was hard to get a 
job, you see, at that time it was hard to ge
t a job if you are not pure in your language 
and you have an accent. In 
America
 it™s not Œ no longer that way, used to be. So, I 
mean, you couldn™t get a job in 
the very beginning, you know 
[indecipherable]
 
some anti-Semitism, I thi
nk, but Œ or it™s just 
[indecipherable]
 against foreigners, 
you see. I don™t know. But wh en ever so
meone leaves a country, comes to a 
different country , he™s not immediately ac
cepted. Takes a long time. Now we accept 
people much quicker, when
 the Jews come in.  
Q: Do you see the interest
 in Nazism from the skinhe
ad s and the other neo-Nazi 
groups as a Œ as a parallel to what was happening in 
Germ any
 before the war? 
A: They could develop into such a thing,
 I think, because they are very adamant 
about hating people and Œ and 
Œ and wherever there™s hate
, there is the possibility 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
43
that it develops into the sa
me a-as before. I know this
 because the thought already 
is, before 
Hitler
, feeling at the time, I saw the Œ 
that Œ th at youngsters, you see, 
called you names 
[indecipherable] 
that™s always possibility. And Œ and in 
Germany
, at least now, they tried to outlaw 
anti-Semitism, you see, here too, but 
you cannot completely outlaw it because you never know what really is in the 
person™s heart. There are some people who 
[indeciphera ble]
 anti-Semitism. 
[indecipherable]
 you see in schools too, some
times they see the teacher 
[indecipherable]
 people, especially when  you go 
to non-Jewish schools. And th ey 
[indecipherable] 
have the books really, what ki
nd of books th
ey read and 
[indecipherable]
. But it™s not on the old Œ in the old 
[indecipherable]
. I like to Œ if 
I see something like this, I™d like to addr
ess it head on, you see, like I do many 
times, you see, even when th
e Nazis invaded our town , I asked them right away, 
don™t Œ don™t want to hide from them, I ju
st want to ask them, why do you have 

this? Some like Œ someone asked me, do y
ou have any Œ do Œ don
™t you Œ do you Œ 
y-you don™t like me because I™m n o t formal, 
I™m not religious, or so, like this, they 
ask me this questions. I say no, I would lik
e you to see and be religious, but I Œ I Œ 
it™s up to you, you see. You have the c
hoice, you see, and therefore I Œ I™m not 
refusing, you know, everything, that is not
hing but my  point of view  is, you see. 
That™s what the most important, like said be
fo re, you have to have
 a point of view.  

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
44
Q: What are the accomplishments th
at you feel the most proud of? 
A: Most important is that when I came here
, you see, I Œ I found something in Œ in 
the education field. And I like the educ
ation field because you can influence th e 
children and people and other pe
ople and Œ and I wo rk  in that field with Œ when  I 
was Œ I had different job, I Œ I founded a 
Œ a Jewish school in th Œ the mountains, 
the mountain there, the 
Catskill
 mountains. I Œ I work ed with th e girls™ schools, and 
I helped bring girls over from Œ from
 Hungary
 and 
Sweden
 to the 
United Sta tes 
on a student visa and I helped banking in
stitution in 1956, th
e children™s home for 
the ke Œ the re-retarded and emotionally di
sturbed children, which is still exists in 
[indecipherable]
. And I Œ I learned with other peopl
e. So I think th at™s a Œ another 
thing, and I wrote a few things, you see, which 
[indecipherable]
 and learn from if 
they want to, and Œ and I think eh Œ but co
uld have done mo re. But we cannot do all 
everything. We can only do a few things
, a few things and everyone does his own 
and we live together in pea
ce and harmony. And to be we
ll and healthy, that™s the 
mo st important. 
Q: What would you ye
t like to accomplish? 
A: I™m writ ing this book, I hope to finish it, because they always ask me, when will 
you finish it, how Œ how far are you? I Œ I™m 
lazy. I just cannot get to it all the time 
because I have many other things, I have here 
[indecipherable]
 chaplain, I go there 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
45
Œ there Œ I give classes here and there and there, so I have to cut down on th is, to do 
one thing. Too many th ings are not good to 
do, ev en if I move it up and Œ I Œ I want 
to finish this book, I hope, and write a lit
tle bit mo re about the experience, and talk 
to people, that™s all.  

Q: Tell me about the book
 that you™re working on. 
A: The book is actually an 
autobiograp hy, but it™s not on
ly an autobiography, also 
it™s something about history in
 it, because Œ I mentioned th
is in the museum, I said 
you only want historians to tr
avel overseas, yeah, I said Œ I said, I™m also a historian 
because I Œ I studied history and languages, 
you know, to see, th
at™s why I n Œ know 
a little bit about every language, but not th
e whole language. Now, towards the end 
is this, I Œ I want it to be maybe part of 
a textbook, so that™s why I wrote also a little 
bit of history in there, you see how 
it came about, and how th e Nazis invaded 
Pola nd . 
Wh at you hear mo stly nowadays when 
peoples talk is th
eir experience in 
concen tration camps, and Œ wh ich unfortunately 
is Œ is a very important part of their 
life Œ lives, but I think it Œ I Œ wh at people
 don™t know so much
, and that™s what I 
am talking to them about in the Œ fo r th
e speakers™ bureau I mentioned it, about how 
was it possible that Nazism developed in 
Germany
 an d what brought it about, you 
see. The antecedents, what 
happened before, you see, 
and ho Œ what it means to 
grow up in 
Germany
, that™s my topic, more or less,
 you see. Not so mu ch Œ and it 

 
Interview with Jacob Wiener  
 
October 25, 1998 
 

 
 
46
wasn™t in the conversation unfortunately 
you see, but I understand it was a terrible 
experience, but here™s what I want to Œ to 
write about in this book, and I don™t have 
a name for it. But I also want to tell them, you see, that I, among the 
[indecipherable]
 I wrote about it, every person has 
to see in this life, miracles 
happen. 
[indecipherable]
 a whole list of miracles th
at happened to  me. I wouldn™t 
be here, the miracles. S o  I feel it™s importa
nt that a person understands themselves 
and understands that he 
is not the guide of the 
[indecipherable]
 you know, no some 
Œ next day something happens,
 you get sick. But you have 
to pray  and you have to 
hope, see. That actually i-is what I believe
 and I would like others to believe it too, 
but I can™t make them believe. But I said 
to them, you see, you can learn a little bit 
from me. 

Q: You mentioned some miracles
 that happened
 to you in 
Euro pe
, getting out of 
Euro pe.
 Wh at miracles happened 
to you in  this country ? 
A: In this country, first of all, when we
 came to Œ I have to start here, coming to 
Canada
. It happened many miracles in 
Ca na da
, I Œ it would be too long to  talk 
about everything, I™d rather 
[indecipherable]
 a miracle happened 
th at we wanted to

A: We will never be able to cover everyt
hing, but I just want to say that, as I 
mentioned before, if you have
 hatred in your heart, you 
Œ you won™t get very far and 
you might only hurt yourself 
and other people. And since I was a social worker at 
one time, I still am, that™s number one. Numb
er two is, you have 
to  have your own 
opinion what you want to live with and Œ 
an d if you feel comfortable, then you 
should do it. And especially if you™re Je
wish you sh ould Œ you should know what it 
means to be a Jew and Œ and you shou
ld teach your children, you see, and 
sometimes your children don™t ask many things
, you see. You should
 play to their Œ 
an age when they ask, and 
when  they ask you should answ
er them as much as you 
can. And I hope that the Holocaust Mu
seum will make it possible Œ makes it 
possible for people to lear
n about that and Œ an -and 
gives everyone a chance to 
experience what other people experienced
, but they should 
also give some 
opportunity for people who experience it to Œ to
 do more in this ar
ea if they want to. 
I want to thank you, that™s all. 

Q: I thank you very mu ch fo r speaking
