A: Well, I suppose it™s Œ the reasons are ve
ry simple, since my father was in the 
military. And when he was move
d in 1939, he was moved from 
Ló dz
 to the eastern 
part of 
Poland
, to 
[indecipherable]
 
Stanis
awów
, which is not too far away from 
the 
Lwów

Q: Excuse me, I™m going to interrupt right here. You™re talking about your father, 
I™m still talking about your uncle.

Q: And was that why he was arrested 
by the Germans? Do you know the reason 
why?

Poland
.

educated people as well? Becau
se both sons were teachers.

And my  grandmother didn™t have any Œ

A: No, th ey mu st have been gone. 
Q: Okay . So  it sounds like you had a Œ a real
ly rather small fam
ily, all told. I mean, 
if you had Œ am I making an assump tion? Is that Œ 
A: Right, m-my  Œ my  Œ my  aunt had two 
sons, they were both younger than  I, but 
they already dead  for several years now. 

Q: Oh, I see, so they were born in the 1930s. 

A: Right. 
Q: But after you. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Mm-hm. What kind of place did you live in, in 
Ló dz
? 
A: Well, when we came to Œ 
from the village, we lived in
 an apartment. And I Œ I 
do remember it slightly. But th
en my  father was Œ decided 
to go back in
to the army, 
and there was an Œ in Œin the Polish army
 there was a Œ like a training system, 

where they would train the young people befo
re they were drafted into the military, 
which Œ which a Œ all the young Poles 
who were drafted, it was just like 
United 
States
 had a draft at one time. And so he 
would be teaching in
 high school, the 
basic skills of the military. 
Q: So he had been in the ar
my before he was a teacher? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

A: Yes, beca Œ well, he graduated from 
Œ from the military 
academy Œ you know, 
the officers™ training school. And he 
left as a Œ as a second lieuten ant. 
Q: Oh, I see. So he had quite a rank, as well. 
A: Well no, it was the lowest Œ lowest offi
cer™s degree. And he Œ because he Œ he 
was a teacher and th Œ and then he 
was teaching these courses in Œ in 
Ló dz
, in 1939 
he was transferred to eastern 
Poland
, and he became assistant to the regional 
co mman d er. 

Q: Okay , before we get there, a little bit 
Œ did he fight in World War I, your father? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No, so he Œ 
A: He was born in 1906, so he
 would have been too small. 
Q: Okay . So  he was rather a young man in Œ 
A: When  Œ when  Œ 

Q: When  World War II broke out,
 he was still quite young. 
A: He was still 30 Œ 33. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Right. 
Q: All right, so yes, I™m sorry I interrupted
 you. So, he was tran
sferred to a village 
in the eastern part of Œ

10
A: No, it was Œ it was a town. 
Q: It was a town, mm-hm. 

A: Town in eastern 
Poland
, and so he went there in about April, and then we 
moved to  Œ to be with him in July, and of
 course in September first, the war broke 
out, and so we were left behind, comple
tely away from our fa
mily. And I suppose 
the reason we were deported was simp le. 
My father was a military and he was 

therefore the enemy of the 
Soviet Unio n
. 
Q: We™ll come to that
, we™ll come to that. 
A: Okay . 

Q: I want to talk a little b
it more about pre-war life. Di
d you go to school when you 
were Œ were Œ were yo
u already old enough to
 start school when Œ 
A: Yes, I was Œ I was seven year olds 
[indecipherable]
 the school year. I was 
seven, and I went to first grade in 
Lódz
, and I graduated from Œ 
Q: First grade. 
A: Œ that in Œ before the Œ before 
Œ you know, in Œ in June of 1939. 
Q: Do you have any memo ries
 of it? Any memo ries of th
is first year of school? 
A: Just sl-slight ones. I know Œ I know 
wh ere I was going, you know, th-th-the Œ not 
Œ it wasn™t too far away from where we liv
ed. And I remember some beginning of 
some poetry that we were learning of how 
[indecipherable]
 was Œ a poem that 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015

everybody knew by heart. And so I reme mb
er some of these Œ these things, you 
know. But I don™t remember the daily Œ 
daily, you know, life or something from 
that. I knew that I could walk by myself, an d Œ 
Q: Did you Œ at home, did yo
ur mo ther have help in ru
nning the household, or did 
she do it all on her own? 
A: No, she did it all by herself. 

Q: All by herself. 
A: And so when  Œ when my father starte
d working for the mili
tary in Œ in Œ in 
Lódz
, we moved in to a military build
ing, an-and that I remember. 
Q: What wa Œ how wa Œ why is it distinct in your mind? 

A: Well, it™s Œ I suppose because those Œ in
 a bigger building, you know, we were 
on seventh floor or something like that, a
nd Œ and it was mu ch nicer apartment than 
the one we had before. An
d so I remember th at. 
Q: Was it bigger? 

A: It was bigger. And I Œ I remember one Chri
stma s that we spent 
there, and by that 
time I had the little dog, and the dog was named 
Tito
. Way before 
Tito 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. And Œ 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
12
Q: A precursor. 
A: Œ and we had the Christmas tree like th
is one in here, an-and there were some 
chocolates hanging on it, 
you know. And the little dog would eat away the Œ the 
botto m of the chocolate, and the chocol
ate would fall out and he would eat it. 
Q: A smart little dog. 

A: Smart little dog, it™s stuck in my  mind. 

Q: Yeah. What are your memories of your father? 
A: Well, I have a Œ a Œ a very distinct memo
ry of Œ of him when he came out Œ after 
he moved into the eastern 
Poland
, he came back, you know, 
to help us get, you 
know, loaded and Œ and things. And I was 
going Œ I was co Œ I was out Œ outside on 
the street, and he Œ an d here wa
s a figure of an officer in a 
Œ 
wh at d o
 
you call these, 
like a long Œ it wasn™t a coat, it was a Œ 
like a hanging thing, you know, it Œ  
Q: Was it a cape? 
A: Like a cape, yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And because he was in Œ in a different un
it in Œ over there, he had to wear this 
cape. And he™s walking in his uniform, 
with the cape on. So
, I remember that. 
Q: He mu st have been  quite elegan t looking. 

A: Yes, of course.

13
Q: What kind of 
a person was he? 
A: Well, I don™t know. He was Œ he was a 
loving father, and Œ and that™s all I can 
say really, because you know, 
I Œ at the age of seven, what kind of recollections do 
you have of what Œ wh
at kind of person your fa
ther was, you know. 
Q: Well, some people Œ yeah , one can™t ha
ve mu ch. But is he someone that you 
were in awe of, or afraid of, or was he 
very warm? Those sorts of thi Œ memories. 
A: No, I was never afraid of my father. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I suppose wa Œ once he started we
aring the military uniform, you know, I 

was quite impressed. Because Polish milit
ary uniforms were very elegant, you 
know, with the Œ with
 the high boots Œ 
Q: Boots. 

A: Œ you know, and things, and so he Œ 

Q: He must have cut quite a figure. 
A: He quite Œ that™s him. 
Q: That™s him? And can you focus in on that
? Let™s focus in on th at picture. Such a 

young man, truly. 
A: Yes. But Œ so he Œ he cut quite
 a figure in the Œ in the uniform.

14
Q: Did th at mean you wanted to  be Œ to 
grow up and be that way to o, or did that 
thought not o
ccur to you? 
A: It didn™t occur to me at that time, but 
en Œ and later on I n Œ actually never did. 
And my military career is something else, and I™ll talk about it later on. 
Q: Okay. All right. All right, so then, let™s 
turn to your mother. 
While I™m at Œ while 
I™m at it, w h at Œ what are your first memori
es of your mother, as a little boy before 

the war? 
A: I don™t know, I don™t really have any 
particular memo ry because she was Œ she 
was with me all the time. I 
suppose when Œ when
 she took me to kindergarten, and 
it would just Œ just happen to
 be that in the Œ in the bu
ilding that we lived in, the 
kindergarten was just across the street. A
nd so she took me there, and I remember 
her at that time. But, otherwise I Œ I don™
t remember hearing an
y park Œ particular 
thing from Œ from those days, that Œ she wa
s there all the time. She was helping, 
you know. 

Q: Again, I™ll ask the same type of questio
n. What kind of pers
onality did she have? 
Was she outgoing, was she more r eserved? 
A: I suppose you could say that she was both. Sometimes she could be very 
outgoing and so metimes she would withdraw 
into herself. But she was very active. 
Before the war she Œ I don™t know how it ha
ppened, but Œ but she 
became part of a 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
15
women™s movement of some sort. And it was 
also kind of a mi-military thing. And 
so these women were head Œ were having 
camps every year. And I rememb er that 
we were went with my mother to those Œ 
those camps, and sh e 
was working in th Œ 
as a quartermasters at Œ at the camp. An
d so she was quite Œ quite active during 
those days, and I suppose she was very 
happy, because you 
know, she would do 
something, so, you know, very useful. An
d one of these camp s was Œ was in the 
area where the president of 
Poland
 came to visit. And I rememb er seeing him at 
that time, in nine Œ 1937, probably . 
Q: So it wouldn™t have been 
Marshall Pilsudski
, he had already died . 
A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, 
he was gone, right. But it was Œ no, no, it wasn™t 
Wojo hosky
(ph). No . Nn Œ he was never pr
esident. But an
yways, so Œ 
Q: But that™s quite impressive.  

A: So I was Œ I was quite impr Œ becau
se you know, the ceremony and everything 
else, he Œ you know, and so  thi Œ all th
e women from the camp  were over there, 
that™s why I Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 that™s why I came, you know, th ere too. So  that Œ 
that I remember. 

Q: Did Œ I mean, you were a little boy, so
 you know, again, it™s lik e you said, how 
mu ch can one really say, but your Œ did you
r parents talk about the things that were 
important to them? And I™ll say what I me
an, like did you have a sense of wh ether 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

16
they were religious people, or whether th
ey were, I would assume, quite patriotic 
people? But what sort of stories do you reme mb er hearing from them, and the Œ the 
things that they did at ho
me? What Œ what were those pillars of Œ of identify, I 
guess one would say. 

A: Well, you Œ I do rememb er s-stories th
at my  mo ther would tell me about Œ about 
her father. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Who traveled when he was Œ when he 
was a young man, he 
Œ he was edu Œ being 
educated in Œ in 
Saint Petersburg
 in Œ in a medical school. And then  he traveled, 
and he traveled through the areas 
through which we traveled later. 
Q: So you mean through the areas of 
Russia
? 
A: Right. And the Œ 
Q: And so you™d hear st
ories about those things. 
A: And I remember to o, this particular 
one, that he was Œ he was in Œ in Œ in  
Tashkent
(ph), and that™s where we went thro
ugh also. And so it was, you know, an 
unusual story that the second and third gene
rations went the same 
way. Slightly Œ in 
slightly different circumstances o f course
, because he went as a free man, and we 

did not. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
17
A: But that I remember. 
Q: Did Œ was there a sense of patriotism at home? 

A: Yes. I think all the time, and Œ and espe
cially with Œ with Fa
ther in the military 
uniform also. It was Œ it was always present.
 I can™t recall any particular talks ab out 
it, but Œ but you know, they Œ th
ey lived thro ugh th e period when  
Poland
 was born, 

so for them it was very important. An
d they  were patriots, both of them. 
Q: What about church? Did th
ey go to church regularly? 
A: Yes. Yes, we Œ we went to ch urch, 
and I Œ I remember Œ I don™t remember the 
name of the church, but I no Œ rememb er 
where it was. And when
 Œ when  we lived 
in the military block, I know.  
Q: Now again, this is probably not fair 
Œ a Œ a fair question to so mebody who was 
six and seven years old at the time, but I™m curious. In 
Lódz
, which is a rather large 
city, there were Œ there was a large Jewish
 population as well. And did you know of 
Œ did you know that there were people wh
o were Jews? Did you 
have any Jews who 
were neighbors? Did that Œ did the Jewish 
world ever, in any way, come across into 
your wo rld? 
A: I no Œ I don™t go, I Œ you know, I Œ 
but Œ but yes, I Œ I knew that it™s a 
multinational, because there was not only Jews, but there were Poles, the Germans, 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
18
the Russians. It was very international city
, because it was an industrial city and the 
Œ the Œ you know, with a
ll kinds of Œ of people. 
Q: So it was multi-eth n ic. 
A: But Œ right, but I don™t remember a
ny kind of a anti-something, an anti-
somebody talks, because my mother was goi
ng with Œ with girls that were of 
German origin and I™m sure th
ey went with  the Œ with  the 
Jewish girls, and then so 
Œ but I don™t reme mb er particular that Œ lik
e if there was a Jew that was visiting us, 
for example, no. 
Q: Well, I™m thinking, did you ever go to streets that were Œ maybe the baker, or 

there would be a tailor, or you would see lik
e stree ts tha t would 
be particularly, you 
know, more Jewish, in the Jewish section 
of town , or Œ or neighbors who might be 

around. That Œ that 
sort of question. 

A: Mm, no, I Œ I don™t Œ 

Q: You don™t remember. 
A: Œ I don™t recall. And I™m sure, b ecause they were all over the place. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So, but it Œ it did Œ it didn™t strike me
 in particular because Œ I guess because 
there was no distinction in Œ in  the way 
that no, they ™re something else, you know. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

19
So in Œ in Œ in my 
mind there was Œ there was no some kind of a predetermined love 
or hatred of somebody else. I thin
k it Œ it was just natural to me. 
Q: Yeah. Did you know Œ did 
you have a sense Œ now again,
 this may not be a fair 
question because I™m asking it of somebody
 who was seven at the time, but did you 
have a sense that there were others, people 
who were not Polish in the city, or is that 
something you learned or knew ab
out later? When you say that 
Lódz 
was a multi-
ethnic place, and Œ 
A: Well, I™m sure I have seen a
ll kinds of people in th e streets. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You know. And Œ and because
 the Jews at that time w ere dressing in a distinct 
way, you know, so you could recognize th
em. And they  Œ m-mo st of them wore 
beards, you know, and things like that. And 
I™m sure I have seen hundreds of them. 
But I Œ it did not impress me in any partic
ular way that this, oh my goodness, is 
something else. So it Œ and Œ and that™s th
e way I am, I Œ  I™m Œ 
I™m very accepting 
person. Besides, I™ve seen many people of a
ll kinds of things, so Œ and we™ll talk 
about it later 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yes, yes. Describe a little bit about the 
city itself, again, th
rough your eyes. You

itary barracks Œ that that Œ not a barracks, 

but an apartment Œ

A: Right. 
Q: Œ that your parents moved to . And was it Œ were you in a section of the city that 

was in the center, or in the outs
kirts, and what did it look like? 
A: Well, I cannot tell that 
[indecipherable]
 exactly, and I did visit it later when I 
was in 
Poland
. But no, it wasn™t a Œ in the middle 
of the city, but it was just a little 
bit away. 

Q: Outside, mm-hm. 
A: But we had the very  good co nnection 
by Œ by rail, you know, in the Œ what do 
you call it, the trams? 
Q: The trams, mm-h m. 
A: Right. And so , I remember having to us e two or three trams to get to my Œ my 
aunt™s place. So Œ 

Q: Mm-hm. Your father™s sister. 

A: No, my mother™s sister. 
Q: Oh, your mother™s sister, okay. 
A: My mother™s sister. And I don™t rememb
er where my Œ my mo
 Œ father™s family 
lived. You know, my  grandfather. But I do 
remember that they Œ he was working in 
a Œ in a factory, and mo
st of the industry in 
Poland
 was Œ was the textile industry. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

Very highly developed textile industry. 
And so he was work ing as a maintenance 
man in the Œ in the Œ in the factory. 
Q: That would have been
 your grandfather?  
A: My grandfather on
 my father™s side. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: So I Œ I reme mb er him. My grandmothe
r died, and I do remember that she was, 
you know, in Œ in 
Poland
 there are no places where you could put the people like Œ 
like a Œ funeral homes. So basically the pe
rson lied in the house for three days 

before the Œ the person was buried. And 
I remember seeing her 
in the Œ you know. 
Q: Was that a shocking thing? You know,
 you had seen her alive, and now she 
wasn™t any more, and you were a child, 
or was that something strange for you? 

A: Well, I™m Œ I™m a Œ I™m sure it was, 
I Œ I don™t recollect it right now. Bu t seeing 
your gran dmother laying th ere and not m
oving, you know, i-it™
s a shock to any 
child. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And you know Œ but it™s Œ it™s so strange
 that I remember that she was laid out, 

and that was natural thing, 
this was the thing to do. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

22
A: And in fact, it was Œ you couldn™t thin
k of anything else, because she belonged 
here, so therefore she goes from here, you kn
ow, to the Œ to the 
burial ground. And 
tha Œ that Œ that I recall. And I do not reca
ll the Œ the funeral of my grandfather, or 
my  Œ  my  mo th er™s mo th er at all,
 b ecause we were not there.  
Q: So, let™s turn now to the place that your
 father is sent in Ap ril 1939. What kind 
of a place was this? What was it called? 

A: It was a small town in th
e mountain area, very beautifu
lly located, that I Œ that I 
remember. And I Œ and I rememb er when ot
her Œ when  we were Œ when  we were 
traveling, I remember when we
 went into the train to Œ to
 start the journey. And so 
he had rented a Œ a Œ part of a villa on a h
ill. So in order to Œ 
to go to the town, you 
had to go down the 
hill and Œ and th Œ an
d walk to the town, because it wasn™t too 
far away. So that Œ that I do remember, and it was really  a Œ a beautiful, beautiful 

area Œ 

Q: It sounds so pretty. 
A: Œ with  the mountains across, 
you know, you could see the hills. 
Q: This the 
Carpathian
? 
A: Yes, yes.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

23
A: Yes. And, you know, we didn™t have tim
e to travel and visit and anything else, 
because we only had tw
o months there. But Œ but I do remember Œ I si ŒI still Œ I 
still can see the view, you know, of the Œ of
 the mount Œ of the hills, because they 
are not very Œ very tall. But of the hills th
at were Œ that were 
across the way from Œ 
from our apartment. 
Q: Well, that was, you know, the summer of
 1939. And was there any sense in your 
world that people were getting mo re ne
rvous, or was it a beautiful summer? 
A: As far as I was concerned, it was a 
beautiful summer. My Œ my  father, you 
know, worked and I Œ I do remember, I think 
that Œ that he took
 us on one of the Œ 
he had to visit the camp wh ere he was trai
ning th-the kids, and Œ and we did go with 
him to Œ to visit that. I don™t recall the de
tails, but then I remember that we went. 
And you know, it Œ the Œ the area, which of co
urse loc-located in Œ in the part where 
many people were Ukrainian, White Russian
s, Jews Œ again, you know, because 
that™s Œ that™s the way it was in 
Poland
, all Œ all over the place. And that I 
remember. And I Œ and I rememb er 
our Œ our apartment very well. 
Q: The villa. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And in the villa Œ 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
24
A: And you Œ you were Œ we
 were renting so -somebody was the owner of the villa, 
and down stairs was a lawyer
 that had an apartment a
nd we had th e one upstairs. 
Q: Tell me about it. What did it look like,
 this apartment. It sounds beautiful. 
A: Well, it Œ we had Œ we had th e Œ th
e living/dining area, and the Œ and the 
bedroom for my po Œ for my 
parents. And the little Œ little place where Œ where I 
lived. And then Œ and the kitc
hen. So it wasn™t very bag Œ big, but Œ but it had Œ had 
the balcony, so you could go on the balc
ony. And we brought a
ll the furniture of 
course, from Œ from which wh en  we moved. 
So it was very nicely fu rnished, and 
my mother was quite happy. I don™t rememb
er how we were going to the Œ to Œ for 
the supplies for example,
 was the nearest Œ near
est shop or something Œ 
Q: Grocery store. 

A: Œ grocery store, but Œ but appa
rently everything was fine, and Œ 
Q: Was it a Œ were Œ was it a resid ential area where there were other villas right 

next to it? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yes, it was Œ as I said, it was located on
 the hill, overlooking the town, and Œ and 
very, very, very nice.

25
Q: Would you th ink that Œ 
would you be able to say 
whether it was a well-to-do 
area of this town? 
A: That I wouldn™t Œ I don™t think so, becau
se my father was ju
st living off of the 
military pay, and it wasn™t that much. 
But Œ but apparently the apartment was 

affordable, and you know, th
-the owner had built the Œ th
e villa several years ago, 
and my father apparently found a sp
ace, and that™s where we moved in. 
Q: Mm-hm. And the name 
of the town again was? 
A: 
Dolina
(ph). 
Q: 
Dolina
(ph), mm-hm. So, any other sort of 
me mo ries  fro m th e s u mmer o f  ™ 3 9 ,  
after you moved there? 
A: No, not until Œ not until 
my father was ordered to
 go back to his unit. 
Q: So tell us about that. Did you Œ oh, excu se me Œ September 1
st
, 1939, did your 
parents have a radio at home? 
A: No. 
Q: So how did you learn that
 there was going to be a war, or that there was a war? 
A: My father mu st have learned 
through this Œ th
rough the office. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Because I don™t remember ex actly when
, but several days later, he was ordered 
to go back . And I reme mb er taking Œ you 
know, taking him to 
the train, oh Œ and

him standing Œ him dressed up in unit Œ m
ili Œ uniform, and saying goodbye to us, 
and I rememb er his picture, it was the la
st, you know, picture of him being in a 
uniform. 
Q: You mean, your Œ the picture in your mind. 
A: In my mind, yes. 

Q: Yeah. I forgot to ask this before, but as far as you co uld tell, were your parents 

close to each other? I know, it Œ 
A: It™s a difficult question to ask, becaus
e you know, what Œ what does a seven year 
old know about Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ wh at their parent Œ but they Œ I don™
t rememb er ever of them arguing or Œ or 
yelling at each other or 
anything like that, no. 
Q: Mm-hm. Okay. 
A: It was Œ you know. 
Q: A peaceful home. 
A: A peaceful 
foam
, yes, that™s v ery good. 
Q: So, when you said he was ordered ba
ck, where was he ordered back to? Was it 
Lódz
? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
27
A: Yes. I don™t know it was 
[indecipherable]
 that he was not reassigned, but you 
know, of course, it™s several months, you kno
w, that it Œ but he was reassigned to go 
to his regiment, and it was 27
th
 regiment of Œ in the army . And so he left, maybe 
two or three days after the war broke out. 
Q: So, early September. 

A: Early September. And by that time I Œ 
and I do rememb er when later on there Œ 
there was a lot of mil Œ you know, people an
d military, they were 
moving out to Œ to 
go to the border and go to 
Romania
 and go to Œ to 
Hungary
. So I remember these 
transports and transports a
nd transports of people on th
e Œ on the Œ you know, horse 
driven carts, and military walk ing. Thousands of people 
just moving out. That I Œ 
that I™m Œ that was even befo re Œ on th e Œ 
of cour Œ of course befo re the Russians 
came in. 
Q: So tell me, 
Dolina
(ph), it Œ was it close to the border of 
Romania
 and 
Hungary
? And was it close to the border of Soviet 
Ukraine
? How Œ was it is Œ a 
borderish area. That™s wh
at I™m trying to say. 
A: Yes, it mu st have been about, you 
know, maybe 50 - 60 
kilometers from th e 
Soviet Unio n
. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
28
A: And about the same  thing from Œ from th
e other bord ers. Because you seen that 
Poland
 was like this, and this th
ing goes straight over here, you know. So  it was Œ it 
was called 
Do-Dolina
(ph) 
Koa
(ph) 
Stanis
awówa
 (ph),
 
and th e 
Stanis
awówa
(ph) 
was largest city. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And now it™s called 
Ivana
(ph) 
Petrowsk
(ph) in Œ you know, 
in the Ukrainian. 
So apparently it wasn™t too far away beca
use people who were just walking, you 
know, within walking di
stance from the borders. 
Q: And you would see this on your st
reet, where you lived , or would you Œ 
A: No, down below.  
Q: Down below. 
A: Down below because the main  st Œ 
main road was goi
ng through there. 
Q: Could you see th
at from your house? 
A: Yes. 
Q: The balcony of your house Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ you could see all the movement. 
A: All the transports were walking, you kno
w. And Œ and of course at that time we 
didn™t know what happened
 with my father at all,
 because when the Germans 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

29
attacked, of course they ™re moving ve
ry  fast, and the Russians Œ on th e 17
th
 of 
September the Russians came in. And my fath
er came back to us after the Russians 
have occupied our area. And he was wound
ed. A shrapnel had hit him in the leg, 
and so he was wounded, and 
he came. I don™t know how, 
but at that time the border 
was still kind of fluid. 
Q: Permeable, mm-h m. 

A: And so he had the chance
 to Œ to escape from Œ because his unit was destroyed, 
bit Œ be Œ by Œ by th e time he go Œ he got 
there, it Œ it was gone. So Œ and complete 
disorder was Œ was in charge of everything
. And so  he managed to co me back to us. 
And he was wounded, 
and Œ and I reme mb er that some
how they fo und out that he 
came back. And the Russian m
ilitary people came in, an d 
they saw him, and they 
saw him being wounded, and 
they said, well, we™ll Œ we
™ll send you a doctor. And 
the Russian doctor came in and was te
nding to his wound. But my  fa Œ 
Q: Was this the fir Œ was this the first ti
me you saw any of the Ru ssian soldiers, or Œ 
or Russian military 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, I Œ no, we saw them also coming in. 

Q: You also saw them coming in. 
A: We saw come Œ coming in, and they we
re not very  impressive, because they  Œ 
they we Œ they kept, you 
know, kind of goofy looking b
oots on it, you know, and Œ

and th-th-th Œ they were not just like,
 you know, Polish milita
ry. They were not 
really very well dressed, but there were pl
enty of them, so Œ and they were armed. 
So that I remember, th eir Œ their 
coming over, you know, transporting Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ themselves into Œ into 
Poland
. And then  ma Œ somehow, I don™t know, they alt 
Œ already the underground system mu st have 
started, because my  father decided that 
he™s not going to be wa
iting until she Œ he is well, so th
ey can take Œ take him Œ you 
know, the Russians can take him.
 So he decided to escape. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And he left us, and went toward the bo
rd er, and there mu st have been some kind 
of, you know, group of people that was bei
ng formed, and apparen
tly they were just 
caught on the border. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And he was brought back into our to wn
, which of course we didn™t know. But 
sometime  l ater, his bar b er, who was a Jew,
 came to my mother and he said, you 
know, my  Œ my  cousin is work ing as a guard
 in Œ in the jail, and he told me that 
your husband is in jail. And he also said 
that if we wanted to visit him, he will 
permit us to get in, provided it™s 
four o™clock in the morning. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
31
A: So, we did go, and Œ 
Q: You too, as well, even 
though you™re a young boy? 
A: Yes, so Œ so we went and Œ and he 
brought my father out from I don™t know 
where, and this was the last time w e saw him. 

Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: So, it mu st have been
 some time in October. 
Q: What did he look like? 
A: Of course, he was no Œ no military unifor
m, he was dressed up in some kind of a 
Œ maybe jail uniform or something, but Œ 
but I don™t exactly reme mber ama Œ as 
that, you know. But this was the last time 
we saw him, and as I said, it was probably 
the Œ towards the end of 1939. And th en we
 were told that all the prisoners were 
being transported away  from Œ from 
Dolina
(ph). And several weeks later my  
mother went to 
Stanis
awówa
(ph), to the larger town
, to inquire about what 
happened  with him. And of co urse, nobo
dy knew anything about it. You know, and 
of course they did, but they
 didn™t. So this was the last
 time I saw my father, was Œ 
Q: Did you Œ you Œ when y
ou went and you saw him th
en, you didn™t know it was 
the last time, and your mother di
dn™t know it was the last time. 

A: No, of course not, of course not
, because we Œ no, we know, you know, 
somebody™s in jail, who knows wh at Œ wh at
 happens. And Œ but Œ so  we didn™t 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

32
expect him Œ but sometime in the begi
nning of March of 1940, th e transport 
occurred, and he was taken out. 
Q: Also, you say he mu st have been 
in jail for several months before Œ 
A: Before he was Œ 

Q: Œ he was taken out Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ taken away. Do  you rememb er his 
deme anor wh en  you saw him? Did you Œ 
you know, did Œ do you rememb
er anything of wh at he said, or your mo ther said, or 
how long the meeting lasted? 

A: No, I don™t rememb er the Œ the Œ the wo
rds that were exchanged, but it lasted 
about 15 - 20 minutes, no longer than th
at, because you know, the Œ th -the fellow 
that was the to Œ that permitted 
that, was taking a very great risk. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because if the Œ if the 
NKVD
 would co me in and just Œ 
Q: And find it. 

A: Œ find it, he Œ he would really suffer. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, so Œ so it was very brave on
 Œ on his part, and ve
ry kind on the part 
of my father™s barber to ev en come up with this idea. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

33
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, so we were grateful 
for that, but it was the last time. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And Œ and after that we Œ 
Q: What did Œ how did your mo ther live? 
I mean, how did you 
Œ did you have any 
savings, did she Œ or were you spared from 
these types of day to day wo rries, where 

will the food come from, how will 
we get by, or things like that? 
A: I™m sure that that™s wa
 Œ that™s the way it was, because you know, the Œ the Œ the 
pay stopped, of course, everything just wa
s ruined. So Œ but it Œ I don™t recall that 
she would be going and selling some of th
e things like it happened later. But Œ but 
this is, apparently she Œ they must have 
had some money. And Œ but you know, then 
the Polish 
z
oty
 had been exchanged, ta
ken out, and th e Russian 
ruble 
came in  and 
Œ and all that, and I really don™t know ho
w Œ how th at happen
ed, but it was just 
several months that we lived, because 
we Œ when  the Russi
ans came in it was 
September 17
th
, and when we were deported, it was April 13
th
. So it™s Œ 
Q: So your father Œ your Œ 
she finds out that he is Œ 
he is taken away, some time 
around March Œ February or March Œ 
A: Something Œ 
Q: 1940? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

A: Yes. 
Q: And she doesn™t know anything else. Di
d you go to  school du
ring those months, 
or was there Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ no school? 

A: No, I did not. Every Œ ev  Œ no, everythi
ng was just Œ just Œ the whole thing was 
shut. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You know, and th e Russians were taki
ng over, and no, I did not go to, like 
second grad e at all. 
Q: Did you vi Œ you and your mo ther, did yo
u venture out of your apartment, or did 
you pretty much stay at
 home during those months? 
A: No, I remember we went Œ we went into  town , and mu st have been to Œ to  get 

some supplies or some thing, but I don™t 
exactly rememb er what stop Œ you know, 
what store we stopped, or something like that. But Œ 

Q: Did th e town  look Œ did Œ 
did you notice anything in th
e town, were there a lot of 
soldiers around, was it Œ the atmo sphere
 and th ings like that, do you reme mb er 
anything about that? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
35
A: No, but you know, y-yo-you
 could feel that it was not the same . Then  Œ an d then 
of course, th Œ right then from the very be
ginning, the Œ the kind
 of terror started, 
where you wouldn™t be able to talk to
 anybody freely. You Œ you would Œ you 
know, it was Œ it Œ you could feel that ev
erybody is kind of 
backing off, you know, 
I™m not going to say anything
, and you know, that™s th
e way it was, because you 
couldn™t trust anyone any mo re. And of co
urse, like everywhere else, there were Œ 
there were a lot of communists, Polish 
communists or Ukrainian communists or 
Jewish communists. And those people woul
d Œ did go into  co
operation, so you 
already didn™t know who you 
can trust. We apparently 
trusted my  Œ you know, the 
landlord, because then he didn™t Œ didn™t 
kick us out or anything like that, so, you 
know, mu st have been  a very kind and good
 person to permit that. B u t, other than Œ 
Q: Did you go to church? Do you reme mb
er going to  church durin g these months? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er at all. I d on™t 
remember. And I don™t even  know Œ I don™t 
even remember what kind of church we we
nt to in Œ you know, before that, but Œ 
because I don™t recall Œ recall that there wa
s Œ there would have been church close 
to where we lived. It must 
have been somewhere else. 
Q: I asked, I mean not only for, you know, 
whether this keeps up trad itions or so on, 
but sometimes in such moments, that™s wh
ere people gather, and they feel safer 
doing it, even if they may 
not speak to one another. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
36
A: Yes, I™m Œ I™m sure Œ I am sure we did attend the masses got Œ but I don™t recall 
seeing Œ you know, being a
ny Œ any church at the time, I don™t rememb er. 
Q: What was your mo th er™s demeanor like during these Œ these months? Did she 
seem to change for yo
u, or not so mu ch? 
A: No, I Œ I Œ she was apparently  a strong character. And so somehow she accepted 
that, you know, and when she was born and Œ until 1914, that part of 
Poland
 was 
under Ru ssian occupation, all Œ you know
. And so  she was not shocked by Œ by, 
you know, being under Ru
ssians again somehow. 
Q: So 
Lódz
 had been under Œ had be
en under the Russian oc
cupation, earlier in the 
century? 
A: In Œ wha Œ in it Œ in Œ be
fore the first World War, yes. 
Q: That is par Œ part 
of the tsarist empire? 
A: Yes, mm-hm. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay, so she was Œ it wasn™t th
e first ti me she saw Russian soldiers. Or 
soldiers. 

A: Right. Different Œ different ones, di
fferent unifo rms and you know, different 
government kind of thing, but Œ 
but she was familiar with that.

A: No, she did not. Even Œ even  Œ you 
know, she probably  some few word s.

Q: Excuse me. 
[technical interruption] 
Okay, where were we? We were talking 
about your mo ther, and her knowledge of Russi
an, or lack of it and so on, and that 
she was not unfamiliar. 
A: Right, but Œ but she Œ I don™t know, ma
ybe she was j u st simply not the type to 
learn other languages. She di
d learn some sp Œ some Fren
ch, and Œ when she was in 
school, but apparently  she had en ough to 
get by when we were finally required to 
speak Russian. But Œ but sh
e did not become fluent, 
you know. Probably enough 
word s to Œ to get by. And th e Russians a
nd Polish are very similar, so you could 
really understand without ha
ving to really learn the la
nguage. And that™s the way 
she was. 

Q: Okay. So your contact w-
with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was 
rather minimal. It was when
 they came Œ the doctor came 
to look at your father™s 
wound, and then your father left, and Œ I 
should say Soviet mil
itary authorities, not 
Russian military authorities. 
A: Right. 
Q: And then it was when you visit him in
 Œ in prison th at one time. Had it Œ had 
soldiers, or had any, from 
the occupying military authority
 been down your street or 
in your home in, you know, after 
that, before Œ before April? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
38
A: No. Becau Œ you know that
 when they found out that
 my father was going Œ was 
out Œ 
Q: Gone. 
A: Œ they  Œ I don™t rememb er that so
mebody came in to 
i n quire about what 
happened, that my mo
ther was beaten, or something like that. Somehow we Œ we 
were lucky enough to  avoi
d that kind of contact. 
Q: All right. So wh at happens in 
April? And what date in April? 
A: Then we Œ then the first deportation fro
m the Polish territories
 occurred in Œ in 
February Œ in February. And 
so we were aware of the fact that people were being 
deported. And of course, you never knew 
who was going to be the next one. But 
then on Œ on April 13
th
 at night, another Œ th ree o™cloc
k, four o™clock in the mo rning 
or something like th at, a banging sounded at
 the door, and th e Russian troops came 
in, and th  Œ we were ordered to pack w
ithin  half an hour, and we™re being taken 
away. So Œ 

Q: And you were woken up from sleep? 
A: Yes, and this is Œ this is the standa
rd  normal way that those units operated. 
Because you were asleep, you were dr
owsy , you know, you 
Œ you don™t Œ you 
couldn™t resist because you we
re not organized yet. And 
so this was the standard 
way that they would come in in the mo
rning. And so we Œ my mother packed 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
39
whatever sh e could into a match Œ kind of 
box, and we were then taken to th e Œ to 
the railroad station in Œ in 
Dolina
(ph). 
Q: And how were you taken? 
A: By Œ by horse driv en cart. 
Q: Okay. Were you the 
only ones in the cart? 
A: Yes. 

Q: I see, so the neighborhood, nobody
 from downstairs, nobody from across th e 
street. You were the only ones? 

A: That™s what I Œ from Œ from 
Œ from Œ within the nearest Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ area. And we were taken over to the Œto the station and lo
aded on the Œ no, I 
call it cattle car, it was just a regular, you 
know, railroad car that how was Œ inside 
was divided into tw o areas. The middle was 
open, and then on Œ the other two they 
had the Œ they had the lower level and th
ey  had another level where we Œ they  
would put the people on. 
Q: So there was like bunkbeds inside the Œ 

A: Like a Œ like a bu Œ like a bunk, but it 
was just a whole solid floor across the 
whole thing. And Œ and so they  loaded 
the entire thing, I don™t know how many, 60 
people, I think were just like Œ we™re ju
st packed, you know. And the doors were 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
40
shut, and in the, you know, several hours 
laters, this Œ the train started and we 
started moving towards the Œ the Soviet border. 
Q: Did you know th at at the time? 
A: Which way we were going? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: No, no. 

Q: Did you Œ did you have 
one of those bunks, were you standing up, were you 
sitting down, were you Œ 

A: I think we were Œ we 
were on the lower floor. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And so th Œ and Œ and a Œ the Œ the Œ 
you know, the only fac
ility that was in the 
thing was Œ was a hole in the Œ in th
e floor where you co uld go and do your 
whatever Œ things. And so we were take
n, and it took couple days, I suppose. 
Because you know, those Œ those transports, 
they are not Œ they 
stopped for military 
and this and that, and th ey didn™t Œ they 
didn™t care how long it takes for them to 
travel. So, a-after a couple days we had to  be
 relo Œ reloaded  into th e Ru ssian train. 
Q: Tell me Œ tell me th is, the Œ the atmos
phere within the cattle
 car, were people 
silent? Were they crying, were they talkin
g, were they Œ what was Œ wh at was going 
on? Did anybody 
say anything? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
41
A: I don™t recall, but I™m sure they did talk ab-about it, you 
know, and Œ but there 
weren™t any c-cries, any yelli
ngs, or anything like that. It was rather quiet, because 
everybody was s-so sc ared Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that you Œ you know, I mean all of 
a sudden you™re taken away  Œ ev erything is 
you Œ y-you in comp letely different wo rld. 
This is what you have, and th at™s all? 
And so it wasn™t something that the peop
le start sa Œ you know, telling jokes, and 
laughing, you Œ you know. It was Œ it was 
rather silent. And I remember when Œ 

when we came to the border, and we had to 
move to the Russian 
trains, because the 
Russian railroad system was wire d in Polish.
 So th Œ we couldn™t use Polish trains 
any more. So we were reload
ed, and kept going east. And th
en realized that we are 
being sent, you know, into 
the territory of the so Œ 
Sov iet Union
. So  it Œ I don™t 
reme mb er how it Œ how long it took, but it 
probably to ok several weeks for us to 
finally travel almost to Œ to the 
Ural Mountains
, just a Œ towards 
the Œ towards the 
Œ with Œ on the south of the 
Ural Mountains
, and Œ and the Œ and the Œ and th e 
steppe begins, the Œ the plains. 

Q: Did you have any Œ I mean, how did y
ou eat? Did they give you any fo od, any 
water? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
42
A: Yes, we were ti Œ we were fed appare
ntly , you know, the Œ the famous Ru ssian 
thing that you can get on 
a train. It™s called 
ki piatok
, the hot water Œ the boiling 
water from the Œ from the engi
ne. So they  would open and 
said okay, okay, go and 
get 
kipia tok
. So everybody went, you know, and Œ 
Q: Did people have cups with them? In Œ did you Œ 

A: You Œ if y-you be
tter had something on your own.
 So that was the only liquid 
that we were given, and they apparently
 mu st have stop on th eir own Œ on th e Œ on 
the way wherever they stopped,
 to give us some bread. An
d in general, in Russian Œ
in 
Russia
 th at™s what you Œ if you™re lucky, yo
u eat bread, not like this one in here, 
but Œ but you were lucky if 
you Œ if you got, you know, 
a hundred  grams of bread a 
day. And that™s the way we were fed. 

Q: Did Œ were Œ did everybod
y survive the three weeks? 
A: Yes. Which was very different from th
e first deportation, wh ere people were 

deported in the middle of the winter. 
And in  that time, many old people, many 
children have died o-of Œ ju
st froze to death. I-In our case no, because it was Œ you 

know, already sp ring. 

Q: So you don™t rememb er the cold Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ particularly. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
43
A: No, no, no, it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t th
at, because no, it was just normal spring 
temperatures already. So we were not 
freezing and Œ an-and it was cold, but we 
were not freezing.  
Q: Did your mo ther say anyt
hing to you during th is trans
port, at Œ during the time 
you™re in the cattle car that you remember
? I™m sure you spoke, 
I™m sure you talked. 
A: Oh su re, n-no, I Œ I don™t remember any particular Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ like I suppose she must have talked to
 m Œ told me that don™t wo rry, everything 
is going to be fine, but I don™t recall this
, as a particular, you 
know, mo ment of my  
life. 

Q: Did you know an ybody else prior Œ I 
mean, there were other people on the Œ on 
the cattle car, did y
ou recognize anybody? 
A: No. 
Q: So, they were all strangers? 
A: They were all stranger, y-you know, you were 
[indecipherable]  
Q: You were just 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ and you know, after being two mont
hs, you know, in an Œ in a new area. 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
44
A: But Œ but you mir Œ you make friends ri
ght there, you™re beginning to talk to 
people and Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ yeah . 
Q: Okay, so tell me w h at happened after that? 

A: Okay, and then after Œ after traveli
ng for some time, we 
were unloaded in 
Kostanay
, which is a capital city of the 
Ka za kh sta n
, 
Ka za kh Republic
. And we 
were transported to a Œ to a 
ko lkho z
, which is Œ 
Q: What™s a 
ko lkho z
? 
A: 
Ko lkhoz
 is a Œ is a farm r
un by the government. 
Q: Okay . 

A: It™s a Œ you know, there 
was no pra Œ private property, there was just a Œ when 
the revolution happen ed, they
 to ok the mi Œ the land from the landlords, and from 
the people and made them into units, whic
h are large administrativ e units called in Œ 
I think our case, 
ko lkho z
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And we would Œ 
we put in a Œ in a Œ the village, a
nd in Œ into the house of a Œ of 
a Ukrainian couple that wa
s deported during 1930s. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
45
A: When Œ when the Œ you 
know, the Russians started th
e killing of the Ukrainians, 
and they just simply starved them to death.
 And I think it was ju
st like nine million 
people di Œ that starved to death, beca
use they started rebelling against the, you 
know, Russians taking their soil, their land,
 their Œ their things
. So they became a 
part of this group that lush
 Œ Russians, as they say, 
pacified them by transporting 
them into the 
Ka za khsta n
. So Œ so  they fully realiz
ed what we went through, 
because they went through it.
 So they were very kind, 
very friendly, you know, and 
Œ and opened their house for us. 
Q: Isn™t that interestin g, given that th
ere had been tension and conflict between 
Ukrainians and Pole
s historically Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ particularly in the border regions. An
d it™s Œ kind of Œ feels almo st like grace, 
that you Œ your destiny 
brings you to a place wh
ere you have people who 
understand what you™re going thro ugh. 
A: Right, you know, and in  Œ and I Œ I 
don™t to Œ I don™t think there was any 
Russian normal person that did not go to 
some kind of something like that. And 
then ta Œ so, we were there for several 
months, and my  mo ther was work ing cutting 
peat.  
Q: Mm-hm. And how do you Œ wh at
 does that mean, cutting peat? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
46
A: Well, you know Œ you know wh at peat 
is, it was Œ it™s a Œ it™s a Œ like a Œ hm. A 
growth of Œ of Œ of a thing Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ and it™s Œ like the growth is so thick,
 that it Œ it forms about a size like that, you 
know. And once you try Œ once 
you cut it into Œ into likesquares, and then it gets 
dried up. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And then you can burn it. 
Q: So it can be used for heating. 

A: It can be used for heating, right. 
Q: And for fuel. 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And so she was doing th at and Œ and 
I remember telling him Œ her telling me 
later is that the Œ the lady of the house, 
that Œ the Ukrainian wo
man  to ok  my  mo th er 
away for Œ for a minute and she said, 
Sabina
, I have to tell you something. My  son, 
who is in the military is coming to visit 
us, and please, for heaven™s sake, don™t say 
anything against the Soviet government, b
ecause he™s going to report you, and he™s 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
47
going to  report us, and all of us are going 
to be taken aw ay. Mo ther about her own 
son. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: So, you know, that Œ this Œ th-this Œ th
at™s the way the syst
em worked. That you 
never Œ you Œ you never kne
w Œ you couldn™t form a
ny kind of units, like you 
know, people getting togeth er and thinking
 and whispering and 
th ing, because you 
were afraid of your neighbors, of course
, but you were also afraid of your own 
children, because the propaganda 
was such strong thi
ng, they said it Œ if they Œ if he 
heard them talking something about the 
Soviet Union
 
[indecipherable] 
government, they wo uld a Œ a Œ have Œ agains
t it. They were Œ there were people to 
be Œ get in river Œ get rid of because you know 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: They™re 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ the system.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, and so  that™s the whole sy
stem worked, it worked
 on the basis of 
complete distrust to
 each other. And Œ 
Q: So that makes it ev en more remarkable 
that you Œ you were 
able to form this 
bond with these people, b
ecause they had gone through
 enough that they reached 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
48
out to you, or you reached 
out to th em, I don™t Œ I don™t know how, but Œ but in th at 
atmosphere. 
A: Right, but wh at Œ apparen
tly they Œ well, the Œ first of
 all, they knew that we™re 
new, so we are not part of the system, 
you know. And Œ and the 
other thing was that 
all of a sudden they  realized that they ha
d gone through that, a
nd they may as Œ may 
as well open their hearts to people that 
are going through it right now, you know, 
and so it was Œ it was really very ni
ce. But we weren™t there too long. 
Q: I see. W h at happened? 

A: And then we were transferred Œ 

Q: Oh, by th e way, did the son Œ did the 
son co me and did you 
meet him? Did you 
reme mb er that Œ anything ab out that? 

A: No, I don™t rememb er that, but Œ but he
 Œ he was going to come right Œ right 
away, so Œ 

Q: I see. 
A: Œ so you know, so sh e Œ he mu st have come. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And you know, th en ev
erybody was quiet and Œ 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
49
A: Œ everything was fine. The Œ the Œ the 
system is wonderful,
 and you know, and 
you have to do anything to surv ive. So ev
erybody Œ they didn™t
 know exactly what 
to do, wh at to say, and how to, you know, say hello fo r the 
Soviet Unio n
, you 
know, 
Batka
(ph) 
Stalin
, and Œ 
Q: What does that mean? 
A: Father 
Stalin
. He was father of the whole Fatherland. So, you know. And it™s 
really stran g e that within few years Œ be
cause the revolution was in 1917, and that 
within few years, it™s to Œ 
what, 20 years, and you could Œ you could create such a 
system of oppression, that Œ of mistrust, of
 Œ of fear. And Œ and s Œ and many times 

you didn™t have to say anything. It™s just 
that youhappened to 
be in the wrong place 
in the wrong time. And you were just arrested. 

Q: So this Œ this knowledge Œ you were
 seven years old. Did you feel this 

automatically? Is this some
thing your mo th er warned 
you about, so that Œ you 
know, don™t talk here, don™t talk there. Ho
w did you know th is, 
as a seven year old 
boy? 

A: Well, that Œ I was listening to Œ to 
Œ to the Ukrainian wo
man  tellin g  my  mo th er 
about it, and so this Œ this is Œ it Œ it 
just becomes natural. You c Œ you c Œ you 
could feel this happening,
 you know, and so everybody
 just simply shuts up. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
50
A: And Œ and a Œ and I d Œ 
I didn™t tell you that, but Œ 
but when we were being 
deported, my Œ my little dog 
Tito
, the chocolate eater, the 
Russian officer that was 
in charge throws it at me and he says 
[speaks Russian]
. Take Œ take your Œ 
Q: Take your dog. 
A: Œ do-d og with you. And so he wa
s deported with us
 to the Œ to the 
Soviet Unio n
, 
and Œ 

Q: There was a dog in the cattle car? 
A: Yes, a little dog in th e Œ and the dog is
 Œ dog was about like this. It™s Œ it™s a Œ 
it™s a kind of a dog that apparently comes from 
India
, but, you know, thousands of 
years ago. And he was simp ly a house dog. 
And wh en we ended up in a Œ in a Œ 
after being taken away from this 
kolkhoz
 and put in another one, which Œ wh ich 
was a Œ a cattle farm Œ  no, I™m sorry, no, this was the 
ko lkho z
 yet. My mother was 
going on Œ on to  this Œ cutting th is Œ this 
peat. And he ru n after her one time, and 
then he c Œ he run away  and come Œ co
mes back after a while, jumping at my 
mo ther and Œ and you know, and Œ and ho
wling and taking, yo
u know, just come 
with me, you know. So  Œ so sh
e goes with him into the steppe, and she sees a Œ a 
big rabbit, killed. And killed by this little 
dog. And what happened in Œ in all these 
generations of being house pet, in Œ in ci
rcumstances li ke this, his past comes to 
him. Because apparently these dogs
 were used to kill the snakes.  

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
51
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: And they ™re little Œ little dog, half of th
e Œ of the rabbit, jumps at the rabbit, 
grabs him here by the throat and kills him one Œ once 
[indecipherable]
. And then Œ
why did he realize that my mother will be 
very happy to take th
is, I don™t know. But 
she came in  and Œ and we ha
d the feast that evening. 
Q: That™s amazing. That™s amazin g . That™s
 amazing and I™m also amazed that the 
cattle car people didn™t eat your little dog, cause everybody™s hungry. 
A: He was not much to eat, you know, so
 the Œ wouldn™t Œ wouldn™t even feed one 
person, so probably  that™s why he survived
. And he surv ived  through th e Œ all Œ all 
our being in 
Russia
, and we took him back, y
ou know, we took him to 
Teheran
, 
and I™ll tell you that later. 
Q: Okay, okay. So he 
got some of your crumbs of br
ead when you were in the cattle 
car, and that allowed him to survive, too. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Wow. Okay. So your moth
er is then transferred. 
How Œ do military authorities, 
or the local authorities Œ 
A: No, the Œ the Œ the loc Œ 
loc Œ local ter Œ authorities ju
st loaded us up and you 
know, send us to another area, and that 
area was Œ it was a f Œ a farm that was 
dedicated to raising cattle. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
52
Q: Okay . 
A: And so all of a sudden from peat digge
r, she becomes a cattle 
rise Œ raiser. She 
had a group of 30 calves that she had to
 take into the steppe, feed, you know. 
Q: So, shepherdess. 

A: Shepherdess, right. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And so she Œ she was doing that fo
r the rest of the stay up north. 
Q: For a city girl. 

A: For a city girl who Œ person that 
was taking care of, yo
u know, camps an-and 
things like that. But that Œ that 
was normal, and i-if Œ in Œ in 
Russia
 there is a 
saying th at 
[speaks Russian]
 
Q: Mm-hm. What does that mean ? 

A: It doesn™t work, it doesn™t eat. 
So Œ so everybody had to work . 
Q: What about you? 
A: No, I was too small. But then wa Œ 
once we were transferred to the other 
location, and it was already getting into 
th e time when the Œ when  the schoolyear 
begins, I was assigned to go to  the Russian school.

Q: So this is half a year. If you™re leaving 
in April, if you™re 
deported in April 13
th
, 
1940, you sp end a couple of months in the 
first place, and then several months in 
the second, and Œ 
A: End of September came around Œ 
Q: And then  September comes around. 

A: Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ and I 
was Œ and I was Œ I was put to school, and I Œ ag ain for 
the fir Œ to the first grade, because I, youknow, didn™t know Ru ssian at all. And Œ 
but fo r a kid to learn is mu ch faster, and 
so I Œ I went to school, and apparently I 
was very good, because I have Œ I got a diploma. 
Q: You got a diploma? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Let™s see the diploma. 

A: Oh yes, I have Œ I have a diploma 
that I was given after graduation Œ after 
completing the first grade. 
Q: So th at would have been a regular sc
hool year, September to May or June or 
something. 

A: Something like that. And this is my diploma. 
Q: Oh my goodness. Got that? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

54
A: And it Œ and this 
[speaks Russian]
 or diploma, because I 
Œ I graduated as Œ as a 
Œ one of the first students. I had 
Œ everything was very good, and so 
Batchka
(ph )  
Stalin
, 
Lenin
 gave me this in appreciation. 
Q: Well, were you proud of 
it as a young ch ild, or did you already feel a sarcasm 
there? 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I already knew what it was all about. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So Œ 
Q: What are some of those other papers? 
A: Oh, this is Œ this is a Œ a Œ was grad
uation from the fir Œ first case Œ grade Œ the 
first grade, and the Russian language, the 
mathematics, history, and I Œ all the 
grades were Œ were very good. 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: Let™s turn it this way a little bit, okay. 
Can you Œ can you focus in a little more so 
that they co Œ we could actually read th
e writing? Okay . Thank you. So you took 
these papers with you. You Œ

A: So so mehow I am Œ I managed to save 
them, and you know, this is really Œ the 
only thing th at I reme mb er, that proves
 that Œ that I was deported to the 
Sov i et 
Unio n
. 
Q: You never had any 
other kind of Œ of Œ 
A: Docu ments, passports or something like 
that? I Œ I don™t think so. I do Œ I don™t 
recall seeing anything that my  mo ther had. 
Q: Now, when those soldiers came to deport
 you, did they in Œ you know, back in 
Dolina
(ph), did they  say why? Did they say, you™re enemies, or did they ju st say, 
pack up you™re leaving? 

A: Yeah, that™s all. They just simp
ly do not discuss these things. It™s Œ 
Q: No reason given. 

A: Œ no reason given, just 
pack up and go. And so, you 
know Œ but I Œ I™m Œ in a 
way I™m glad that I Œ that I went to sc
hool, because I still remember a lot of 

Russian. I cannot Œ I cannot ju
st talk too mu ch, because you know that, after years 
of not using it. But Œ but Œ an
d it™s Œ it™s very difficult for me to Œ to read, but after a 
while I can Œ I can begin to 
read, you know, and so  like 
[indeciphera ble]
 just, you 
know, it comes out. But Œ but it™s Œ but it isn™t Œ oh, and this is Œ this is 
[speaks

the national Œ 

Q: The people™s 
commissariat
? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
56
A: Yeah, 
commissariat 
of education. 
Q: I see. I see. 
A: So, you know, I™m 
very proud of this. 
Q: Well, actually, I think it™s 
something very mu ch to be pr
oud of, for a child that is 
traumatized  like that, to still be able
 to perform in school to such Œ 
A: And Œ and Œ an
d Œ and I di Œ passed grades, so Œ 
Q: Yeah, you know. I™m sure that your mo
ther was very pleased, even though it was 
Œ 

A: Well, you know, it wa Œ it was Œ I™m glad yat Œ that I did, that I didn™t waste my  

time, that I have learned basics to the poi
nt wh ere Œ I™ll tell you later, probably, this 
was useful for me when I was in 
U.S. Army
. 
Q: No kidding. No  kidding. 
Okay, we™ll talk
 about that. 
A: Okay. Anyway, so th-the rest of
 the time that we 
spent in 1941 Œ 
Q: So where did you Œ excuse me Œ you Œ 
you moved to this other place where she 
becomes Œ she starts h erding cattle. Your 
living circumstances, were you Œ tell me a 
little about that. 

A: Well, we lived in a Œ in a Œ a barrack. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
57
A: That we were assig n ed, I think we were
 like three families in 
Œ in one room in a 
barrack. And s Œ it was just the place for 
you to put down for night. And because 
my mother was working, so 
she was entitled to Œ to so me
 kind of a ability to get 
food, you know, from the local store. 
Q: Were you hungry during these times, during th ese months? 

A: Most of the people in the 
Sov iet Union 
are hungry. If you surv ive on a piece of 
bread that™s about that size, you know, of
 loaf of bread, and maybe little bit of 
vegetables, or something th at, you know, 
that come out your way, yes, you are 

hungry all the time. Maybe you™re not 
starving, but you kn
ow, you don™t Œ you 
don™t Œ an d there™s not mu ch Œ not Œ not mu -m
uch else to eat. And you just Œ so  you 
just simply feed yourself with th-the least 
things that you can get. And it Œ it™s Œ in a 
way it™s good because you don™
t have to spend your time 
cooking things, you know. 
But Œ  
Q: So it™s a Œ it™s a far cry from 
Tito
 eating candies off of a Christma s tree. 
A: Yes, it was a ver Œ a very far cry. But 
Tito
 was wi-with us, and he Œ he became a 
Œ a protector dog of the cattle. Because I 
remember one time the Œ the wolves came 
into the village, you know, to
 see if they can get one 
of those calves, you know. 
And it was in Œ in the evening and I reme
mber the whole village came out with Œ 
with you know, someth
ing to bang on and trying to 
get those Œ those wolves out. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
58
And my  dog run out and he started after 
them. And since they never saw anything 
like that in their liv
es, they got scared. 
So they started escaping and he run after 
them. And I said to myself, well,
 that™s Œ that™s the end of 
Tito
. Well, after couple 
hours he comes back, he™s Œ his mout
h fu ll of Œ of you know, wolves™ Œ 
Q: Fur? 

A: Œ wolves™ fur. So apparently he was ch
asing th em and Œ and biting th em, and he 
chased them away. So he became a hero of 
Œ of the Œ of the farm
. S o  Œ he had quite 
a life. 

Q: Was sort of like, you know, in 
Shakespeare
 when he wrote ﬁ
Romeo and 

Juliet
,ﬂ and it was a tragedy, he™d introd
uce some comic relief. So here is 
Tito
, he™s 
the comic relief. 

A: That™s right, that™s right. And so, you 
know, all the people in
 the village really 
liked him, you know, and all that kind of 
stuff. And he surviv ed until later. And I™ll 
tell you about that. 
Q: Okay. So, during this time, do you kn
ow whether your mo ther was able to 
inquire about your father, or not even? 
A: Oh, no, no, not at Œ not at all. 
Q: Not at all. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
59
A: No, because the system is 
such that once you Œ you be
come arrested, you are lost 
to your family. You just simp ly, you know
 Œ and you don™t want
 to Œ anybody to  
know, because then yo
u became a Œ a Œ an enemy of 
the people. So, you know Œ but 
everybody knew, of course, that we ar
e the enemies, because once we were 
deported, that means that you are the enem
y. And Œ but Œ but Œ 
but the locals were 
understanding. They  knew, because they we
nt through the same thing themselves. 
Q: Even in th
e second place? 
A: Ena Œ even in the second
 place. It was Œ some of the people were there, you 
know, the same way, and th e only other thi
ng that I remember, othe
r than just Œ just 
going to  school is that one time a Russian, 
whoever, one of the representatives came 
in to me and he said, you know, we Œ we 
lost a couple horses, 
they escaped, they  
run away into the steppe and 
they  probably  went 
to this other vil Œ you know, place. 
Are you willing to Œ to go after them and 
bring th em back? And of course I said 
yes, of course. So they gave me a horse
, and they say okay, you go that Œ that 
direction, and that Œ that village is over 
there. And somehow I managed to go there. 
Q: You™re eight years old. 
A: Eight years old. And to bring those 
two horses back. And 
in the meantime my 
mother almost had a heart attack, because th
ey told her do Œ what
 they did. And you 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
60
know, to get lost in the steppe is no 
problem at all. But somehow, I don™t know 
how, I managed to come back. 
Q: Wow. 
A: So not only my 
dog was a hero, but I was a hero also.  
Q: Did you Œ when you were 
in the cattle car, and you st
arted talking to people, do 
you remember anything about an y of those 
people, wh at kind of people they were, 
whether they were all military fam
ilies, or some professions, or Œ 

A: No, they™re Œ they were
 a congregation of all kinds
 of people. Because you 
know, anybody that wo
rked for th e polis Œ Po lish government was naturally a Œ a Œ 
Q: An en emy. 

A: Œ an en emy. So they  Œ they  had prof
essors, they had teac
hers, they had, you 
know, simp le people who were in the army
, you know, for example, you know, just 
Œ just being a private in the army. But it wa
s in the army  of the Œ of the enemy of 
the Œ of the 
Soviet Unio n
, so Œ 
Q: And when you were in both places, I 
get the impression th at your contact, 
actually, with official author
ities was rather minimal. T h ey weren™t part of your 
daily life, but they 
controlled your lives. 
A: Right, because you know, th-the Œ the th
ing is that Œ that 
once you get deported 
into these vast territories, 
you Œ you Œ you can be
 physically free, because you™re 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
61
not going to  go away  anywhere, because it is
 just simply impossible to escape. And 
I read many books later on, that Œ it™s the 
same thing is written in Œ in many books 
or people that were actually in jail, they 
were Œ they were, yo
u know, under Œ under 
the Œ the supervision of the Œ of the milita
ry and th ings. And Œ bu
t they were free to 
move about, because they didn™t c Œ ther
e was no way you can 
escape. Because you 
knew that once you walked aw
ay into the Œ into
 the steppe, you™re dead. And if 
you™re not going to  just die because of hung
er, you Œ th -the wo lves are going to get 
you. 
Q: Tell ma Œ you know, for those of us, an
d I™m one of them, who Œ I™ve never been 
in a steppe. What does a steppe look like? 
A: It™s Œ it-it™s a just vast space, flat. 
Q: Anything grows in it? 

A: Just a Œ just weeds, just, the s Œ you know,
 grass. No trees. Ju
st si mply no trees, 
just flat as you Œ as far as
 you can go. Just like sometime s 
it feels here in Œ in Œ in Œ 
in Œ even in 
Illinois
, except here they are, you know
, they™re farms. But over there 
just simp ly, what it probably  was here a couple hundred  years ago, just plain full of 

grasses. 
Q: And probably small animals. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
62
A: And some Œ some small  animals, some
 wolves, you know, things. And in th e 
middle of those Œ of those things, there were
 these locations of 
different farms, and 
like this one that we went Œ that we we
re, the Œ the cattle farm. Or th ere were Œ 
there were both the grown-up cattle 
and the calves, you know, and so Œ 
Q: You might have 
Œ you might have mentioned it 
before, but tell me again the 
name of the first place you were at, w
ith the Uk rainian couple, and the second 
place. 

A: The first place I don™t remember. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But Œ but the second one I 
Œ I even know the address. 
[speaks Russian]
. The 
first Œ the farm number one, 
Krabawick
(ph) was Œ was a little town that was like a 
c Œ a county seat. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And 
Kosta n ay
 was the Œ the capital. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So, that I remember. The little 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t remember what its name 
was. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
63
Q: So, you were there at least through th
e school year. What about the summer o f 
1941? Where Œ in June 1941, the 
Soviet Unio n
 is attacked by Nazi 
Germany
. Did 
you find out about th at in this remote, remote place? 
A: Apparently yes, later on, because 
you know the Œ th -the newspapers would 
arrive there from time to time, an d th-the
y would learn from the Russians we would 
Œ we would find out. But it wasn™t until later, 
of course, that it came to us somehow, 
you know, through word of 
mouth or whatev er, is that Œ that there Œ once the 
Russians were attacked, an
d the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the 
Russians somehow managed to make contac
t with the Œ with 
the west, with the 
British and the Americans. An
d they formed a ali-allianc
e all of a su dden. And so, 
because they Œ they couldn™t have enough equipment, 
you know, so the Œ so  the 
British and the Americans started supply
ing them with Œ with the military 
equipment. And at that time, of cour
se, the Œ the relationships betw een the 
Soviet 
Unio n 
and the Polish govern ment was broken in
 1939, and we didn™t have any mu  Œ 
a-any diplomat relations with
 Œ with them at all.  
Q: Wa Œ explain how there could be
 a Polish government, where was it? 
A: Well, in Œ in 1939, as I told you, 
there were people, hundreds of people, 
thousands of people moving out of 
Poland
, going Œ going south. The Polish 
government also left. And from Œ from 
Hungary
 they were then
 transported to 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
64
France
, and they f Œ reformed as a Œ as a 
new govern ment representing different 
political parties. Then es-estab
lish ed this Œ themselves in 
France
, and they started 
building up Polish military, because there were
 a lot of people that were escaping. 
And that Œ they somehow managed 
to escape then from Œ from Œ from 
Romania
 
and from 
Hungary
, where they were Œ they were 
interned, because those countries 
were Œ were in Œ were Œ what do you ca
ll it? Were not participating in war, they 
were Œ they were neutral. So they Œ by 
the thousands they just run different ways. 
You know, the Œ the roads opened to 
Italy
 and Œ and all kinds of places. 
Q: So this is where your father
 had hoped to be able to land. 
A: That™s what he was hoping, that he™s 
going to Œ to  end up. And so  they fo rmed 
military units in 
France
. And th en, of course, when  
France
 was attacked, they did 
give up ev en sooner than Œ than  
Poland
 did. And since we ha
d an alliance with Œ 
with the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from 
France
, into 
England
. And this Œ so the Polish governm
ent had reestablished itself in 
England
, 
and upon British insistence, the 
Soviet Un ion
, because I don™t know exactly what Œ 
what was the Œ the Œ the word
s, but they said, you know, okay, we™ll Œ we™ll qui Œ 
give you equipment, but you know, you 
got Œ you Œ you telling us to open the 
second front, you know, we not quite ready 
yet. But you have thousands of Polish 
troops in the 
Soviet Union
 prisons. Why don™t you rele
ase them, an d you™ll have 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
65
ready troops, you know. So so mehow they  ma
naged to reestablis
h relationship with 
the Polish govern ment in Œ in 
London
.  
Q: So it™s the Americans and the Britishwho are saying this to the Soviets? 
A: Right. They said, you know, wisŠwe
™ll help you, but 
Œ but you know, you 
saying th at you don™t have enough troops, an
d blah-blah-blah-b lah,
 this or this. But 
you know, you have Œ 
you have maybe couple hundred
 thousand troops that you 
have arrested when you came into 
Poland
. Because that™s what happened, you 
know, because the units that 
were located in Œ in the eas
t, they were all, you know, 
taken over by th e Russians, and by th
e thousands they  were deported to 
Russia
. 
And as you probably know, th
e Œ th e Œ many of the officers and Œ and a Œ and a -- 
leading classes, like judges and teachers and 
things, they were Œ they  were arrested 
by th e thousands by the Soviet
s. And Œ and th en the Polish officer corps, at Œ at 
least they know about 20,000 that were killed in 
Katy n
, which was several times 
where they decided to liquidate the Po
lish military prisoner
s of war, which was 
against, you know, the 
Geneva Conference
, of course. But they  killed 14,000 that 

was known, that Œ that were Œ that Œ that were killed. 

Q: Do you think your father 
might have been  amongst them? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t think so, I don™t 
think so, because those were the officers 
that were Œ that were arrested as Œ as th
ey gave themselves up 
to Œ to the Russians. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
66
Because you know, 
Poland
 ha Œ had a Œ had a 
Œ a pact of Œ of military help. And of 
course when the Germans and the Russians r
eestablished their pact, th-the Russians 
just liquidated that Œ that pact, so th-th-th
e officers that were 
arrested, you know, in 
the Œ in the military, 
they were in mi-military  uniforms,
 they were in the units. So 
the troops were sent, you know
, into exile, but the officers 
were put in the Œ in  a Œ in 
the prisons. 
Q: Let me go back a little bit. When you we
re talking about the first days of the 
war, and the Germans 
overri Œ overrunning 
Poland
 very , very quickly. And then 
September 17
th
 the Soviet army marching in. Were
 you surprised to see the Soviet 
army? Did anybody Œ I mean, 
did anybody expect to se
e them? How did they kn Œ 
A: Th-Th-They Œ they came in
 and th ey were actually sayi
ng that they are helping 
us. They are liberating us.  

Q: From? 

A: From the possibility of being take n over by the Germans. And then Œ 
Q: So th at was Œ that was what officially was being spoken? 
A: This what Œ what Œ what was te
lling people on the street, you know. And 
because we didn™t Œ you know, th-the
y didn™t let know that they had the 
Stalin
 li-
libben Œ 
Ribbentro p-Molo tov Pact
, which they signed in August. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
67
Q: So tell Œ I mean, this is all stuff outside
 of your own specific experience. But to 
put it in some context, can you explain a little bit about that pact? 

A: Well, as I said, th-the Œ the Russian and 
Poland
 had non-aggression pact Œ 
Q: 
Russia
 and 
Poland
, mm-hm. 
A: Œ for the Œ for the 10 years, and so 
we did not expect that the Soviets would 
move. But th e 
Hitler
 and Œ and 
Stalin
 signed a pact, called the 
Ribbentrop-
Molo tov Pact
. 
Q: And what Œ what are those names? Mili Œ 

A: 
Ribbentrop 
was a German repres-representative 
of Œ of the government, and th e 
Molo tov
 was the Œ the Russian like min Œ 
Q: Soviet. 

A: Œ Soviet Œ Soviet minister of mili Œ of
 the military affairs. And so they signed a 
pact where the Œ the Russian
s told the Germans that th
ey are Œ they will attack 
Poland 
from the Œ from the east. 
And they  pre-assigned the border, which th ey are 
going to  divide 
Poland
 into Œ into, you kn
ow, into two parts. And so, on September 
17
th
, they just simply moved. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
68
A: And Œ and so  the Œ all th
e Polish military were, you know
, surprised as to what™s 
going on. We have pact of 
non-aggression with you, a
nd Œ and so that™s what 
happens. 
Q: So, in  other word s, they had the pact. There were several pacts going on. There 
was a Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and th
ere was a surprise on the side of the 

Poles when they see the Soviets there, be
cause what happened  to our pact? Then  
there is the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
, wh ich was signed Œ 
A: Which kind of canceled Œ 

Q: Œ canceled that one. 

A: Œ canceled the Polish 
Œ Polish-Russian pact.  
Q: And that one is when  Nazi 
Germ any
 and 
Soviet Unio n
 ag ree not to fight each 
other, and divide 
Poland. 
A: Right. 

Q: And then when the Soviet s march in, they tell people 
Œ locally, the word on the 
street is that we™re here to
 save you from the Germans. 

A: Right. 

Q: Okay. All right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
69
A: We are here to help you. And so , you 
know Œ and the Œ and then the Œ once the Œ 
this became and Œ and 
they came in to 
Poland
 and Œ and all that, I remember they 
were al-always saying 
[speaks Russian] 
Q: What does that mean? 

A: We are friends with 
Germany
. 
Q: They would say that? 

A: They would s Œ the military, you know, 
people that Œ well, the authorities, were 
saying that they are friends of the Germans.  

Q: And yet they™re saving y
ou from German occupation. 
A: Right. Well, because they took over, you 
know, that Œ that Œ 
and that they Œ you 
know, several months after they Œ they 
took over, even  before 
we were deported, 
they had elections. And 99.9 percent of Po
les voted for those territories to become 
parts of the 
Soviet Unio n
. O-On paper, of course. 
Q: Did your mo ther have to
 vote in those elections? 
A: Everybody had to  vote. And it didn™t
 make any difference how you voted, 
because the percentage came out 99.9 anyway. So Œ 

Q: So, let™s go back to the 
address of the place that 
you were, which I could not 
repeat for the life of me. And in 
June 1941, the Na
zis attacked the 
Soviet Un ion
, 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
70
and somehow world Œ word must
 filter to your village th
at Œ that now Œ you know, 
there is an attack, the 
Soviet Unio n
 is at war on its own territory. 
A: Well, there™s not 
[indecipherable]
 yet, but they were Œ th
ey just moved to Œ to 
west Œ 
Q: Eastern. 

A: Œ the eastern part of 
Poland
, and then it™s a military Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: But apparently this is what Œ this is 
what Œ what happened, and as I said the Œ 
they would receive from y Œ from time to ti
me the newspapers, and all of a sudden 
ne Œ you know, the ne
wspaper just turned out to wr
ite like that. Because once we 
were friends, and now we™re the enem
ies. And so, somehow this kind of 
information got leak
ed into Œ into our areas. 
But it didn™t make any Œ any 
difference, until later on, when the re Œ when the relations were reestablishment 
between the Polish and the Russian governme
nt. And when  the Ru
ssian issued a Œ a 
document, which made us back
 free citizens, with ability to
 move on the territory of 
the 
Soviet Unio n
. 
Q: And when did you find out
 about this? Ho w did Œ did 
somebody come to the Œ 
the barracks that you and your mother lived
 in, one day, and say you™re free now, 
you can move about the 
Soviet Union
? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
71
A: I don™t know how it happened , of cour
se you know. Bu t Œ but this is Œ I know 
that later on from Œ from reading,
 that this is what happened
, is that Œ that all of a 
sudden, even the 
people in our Œ in our little commun
ity have realized that now they 
can move about.  
Q: But Œ but Œ okay, now I™m going back  
to your life and your mother™s life and 
your experiences. How did this happen with
 the two of you? Was there a mo ment 
when you found out,
 an d  do  yo u  rememb er t h at mo men t ? 
A: Oh. I remember Œ one Œ one thing I rememb
er is that after that h appened, is that 
all of a sudden the older Œ the people that 
were located within Œ 
within the territory 
that we were in, somehow they discovered 
that the Polish army 
is being fo rmed, in 
the southern states of the 
Soviet Unio n

Beginning File Two 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum 
interview with Mr. 
Witold Pawlikowski
, on January 21
st
, 2015. And before the 
break, Mr. puli Œ 
Pawlikowski
, we were talking about th
e mo ment, or let™s say the 
Œ the Œ th e time when you and your mo ther 
learned of the agreement that the Polish 
government in exile made with the 
Soviet Union
, and what was going on, you 
know, in those Œ in those immediate days an
d months. Before we get to that, I want 
to know, did your Œ did you make friends, 
did your mo ther make friends with other 
Poles while Œ or other people while she was in the 
Sov iet Union
? You had 
mentioned before that people were very 
distrustful, and kept a distance between 
themselves. Was there ever any exception 
to  that, when  people brid ged the gap? 
A: Well, in a way, but you know, it Œ it wa
sn™t Œ it wasn™t a friendship. You just 
don™t develop friendship all of a sudden  
like that. It was Œ it Œ it was a Œ a kind 
feelings towards us, und-u
nderstanding feelings, that th
ey know what we™re going 
through because they ha
ve been through it.  
Q: That means the lo
cals who were there. 
A: Right. And Œ and Œ but it™
s very gi Œ difficult to call 
friendship, if you™re there 
for three or four months and you move so
mewhere else, you know. It™s Œ it™s n o t th 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
73
Œ not the same thing as you develop friends
hips over a long period of time. But it 
was g-good relationships, let™s put it this way. 
Q: And what about other depor
tees. Di Œ do you get to meet
 or get to know, in any 
way become close to other deportees? 

A: Yes. The-These Œ these were Œ these we
re your Œ your people, and so, you know, 
and Œ and since we are in the same village
, and well, like I said beginning that we 
lived in with two other families in  ther
e. So Œ so you developed th is kind of 
friendship. Which lasts Œ I have friendsnow that Œ that I Œ not too many, I Œ I 
haven™t Œ those that I met in the 
Soviet Unio n
, they all went different ways. But the 
ones later on in 
Teheran
 and 
Iran
, I Œ I ha Œ I maintain
 friendship with those 
people until now. And I Œ I remember an Œ 
an incident when I was working for steel 
Œ 
U
.
S
. 
Steel Corporation
, and I was traveling th roughout the 
United States
, and I 
Œ so I Œ I went Œ I was going to  
Cleveland
, and I told my boss,
 I Œ I said that™s 
great, because I have a friend in 
Cleveland
. And then a few months later, I-I was 
going to 
Philadelphia
, and I said, oh, it™s terrific, I have a friend in 
Philadelphia
. 
And then I™m going to 
San Francisco
, and he says, if you te
ll me that you have a 
friend in 
San F ra n cisco
, I won™t believe it. A nd I said, 
but I do. So he said, how in 
the heck could you guys do 
that? Well, you know, I have a friend that I just talked 
to just recently who 
Œ who lives in Œ in 
Argentina
. I have friends in 
Australia
.

That™s Œ that™s the way Œ what happens, y
ou know, that those people spread around 
all over the place. I have fre Œ friends in 
Cana da
 that Œ th at we visit, and we Œ we 
keep the Œ those friendships.  
Q: You mentioned something to me earlier, 
that your mo ther also developed su ch 
friendships. That there was a lady in 
particular who was her best friend. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about her? 
A: We Œ we Œ we were in the same co
llective farm, and she was there with her 
mother. 
Q: Who was this lady? 
A: Her Œ her name was 
Leila
. She was a Polish Jewess, and my  mo th er had 
developed close friendship w
ith her, and then when we Œ we left, sh e went to 
England 
so oner than  we did, because her brother was in the Po lish army . 
Q: So sh e was Jewish, and she had been  deported as well. 

A: She wa Œ she was deported as well, with
 her mother. And so when Œ when Œ after 
years that we haven™t seen her, because she was already in 
Eng land
, when we 
finally ended up in 
Eng l and
, she Œ she ca-came to visit us, and th en I was moving 
to 
London
 from the little town that Œ up in th
e Œ almo st on th e Scottish border. And 
so she accepted me there, I was wi
th Œ with her for some time. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
75
Q: Oh, so you lived
 with her, then? 
A: I lived with her, and then after years, 
you know, after I came here, and I was in 
the army again, and we f Œ with a friend 
mi Œ of mine, we Œ we went to visit 
London
, and we went to visit her. And at 
that time she was working for a very 
exclusive nightclub. 
Q: Oh, really? 

A: And she invited us 
and Œ and we met Mr. 
Errol Flynn
. 
Q: Oh, my goodness. 

A: That™s right, that™s right.  

Q: Oh, my goodness. And Œ 
A: So Œ so, you know, these 
friendships last a lifetime,
 because you had something 
in  co mmo n. 
Q: You had this experience
 that you™d gone through. 

A: Yes. Mm-hm. 
Q: Did you ever meet her brother, who was in the Po lish army ? 
A: Yes, and he moved to the 
United States
, he lived somewhere in
 the Œ in the west 
coast, and he™s gone by now. 
Q: And do you know mu ch ab
out their story, where they were from? Where she Œ

Q: Okay , about somebody
 else that you know. 
A: Right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
77
Q: Okay. So Œ so yes, so 
your mother and other people
 in Œ you know, who were Œ 
who were deported from 
Poland
 learn about this agreem
ent where you™re free to 
move, yes? 
A: Right, and Œ and how did it come and 
all way to th is little godforsaken place, I 
don™t know, but we found out that there is 
an  agreement, and th
at by this agreement 
all the Poles are released 
from the prisons, and then th e Polish army  is being 
formed. So when Œ when
 this group of Poles in our village and o-other places heard 
that, they all got together and they deci
ded to  move south towards wh ere the army  
was being formed. 
Q: So how were you going to 
do that? How did they do that? 
A: We were transported to Œ to this Œ to 
the railroad station, I don™t know how, how 
they managed this I have no idea, but th
e transport was formed and we were moved 
to the railroad station, loaded on a train.
 And the train, I think it was like six weeks 
that we were on the train. Again, the 
cattle car, and so we were moving from one 
place to another, until we
 went to Œ through 
Tashkent
(ph), the place that my 
grandfather was Œ was in
, and we went thro ugh 
Bukha ra
(ph) and I Œ I don™t know 
how many other places. 
Q: Was Œ was the cattle car differe
nt than the first cattle car? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
78
A: Well, it was Œ it was sligh
tly bigger, because of Œ of the railroad system of Œ in Œ 
in the 
Soviet Union
. But the Œ the Œ you know Œ 
Q: The slats were the same. 
A: The slats were the sa Œ the 
same. Except for more people.  
Q: And I take it they weren™t closed then
, and Œ and you weren™t lock ed into  these 
cattle cars. 
A: No, we were not locked any more. 
Q: Okay . 
A: No, because we were fr
ee citizens to move
 about. Which is, you know, very 
unusual in th e 
Soviet Unio n
. And so, in traveling all these Œ these distances, w e 
finally ended up where they 
decided to unload us because
 the railro ad wheels were 
being abused, you know, so we had to 
discharg e. And they  moved us to a 
ko lkho z 
called 
Frum za
(ph). 
Q: So this was a collective farm called 
Frum za
(ph)? 
A: It was a collec Œ collective farm called 
Frumza
(ph), and is Œ and it wasn™t far 
away, maybe 20 kilometers
 from what they call now 
Almaty
(ph). 
Q: Ah. 
A: Or 
Almata
(ph). 
Q: 
Almata
(ph), mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
79
A: And so we™re unloade
d there, and put in a 
ko lkho z
, and then we fo
und out that a 
part of the division is being formed in Œ in  alna Œ 
Almata
(ph). And we were with 
this other woman and her s
on, and both my mother and 
she became ill with typhoid 
fever, and she died. 
Q: The other lady died? 

A: The other lady died. The son was 15 or 16 
at that time, older than I was, and so 
my  mo th er, y ou  kno w, 
to ok  care of h im. An d  my  mo th
er almost died also, but she 
was Œ and she was Œ she was Œ she told 
me later on she was moved from the room, 
into the hallway, and this 
Œ the Œ th e nurses said 
uzha
(ph) 
konshied
(ph). She™s 
finishing up. And Œ and then my  mo ther 
said no. I have a son. And then she 
recovered. And so, what happene
d that this Œ this Œ this 
lady™s husband was in a Œ in 
a Polish military unit, a corps of engin
eers, and he escaped and was in Œ in 
Palestine
. And Œ 
Q: Did she know that, or Œ 
A: And she knew that, and he had 
also her addresses fro m Œ from the 
Soviet Unio n
. 
So he discovered that his best frien d 
is in a unit that is being formed in 
Almata
(ph). 
And his friend came to pick us up Œ pick
 them up and take them to where the 
military was. And she was gone already, so  instead, we were taken, and Œ and Œ 
Q: And the boy. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
80
A: Œ and the boy. And Œ 
Q: What was his name? Do you remember? 

A: 
Janusz
. 
Q: And his last name? 

A: 
Sohachewski
(ph). 
Q: 
Sohachewski
(ph). 
A: 
Sohachewski
(ph). And wh en Œ wh en Œ wh en we came to 
Teheran
 his father 
took him and brought him to Œ to 
Palestine
, and enrolled him in Œ in the Polish like 
organization of Œ like a mil Œ 
paramilitary organization. And 
then, of course he went 
to 
England
, and he lives in 
England [indecipherable] 
right now, and we keep in 
touch. 

Q: Amazing. Amazing.  

A: So, you know, he™s just like my  older brother. 

Q: Did you have hopes of maybe finding 
out about your father
 when the Polish 
military unit was formed? 

A: Right. My Œ my Œ my 
mother had written to the Po
lish Red Cross, and the 
international Red Cross and I Œ somewhere she has a Œ a document which is Œ it 
appears that your husband has 
died on the territory of the 
Soviet Union
. And that™s 
the only thing we have. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
81
Q: Oh, my. 
A: But there Œ there™s no record of when 
and how, of what causes Œ was it his wo Œ 
you know, re Œ rework
ing of the wound, or was he 
killed? We don™t know. Because 
this kind of documentation you simp ly do 
not get from t h at system.  There, nobody 
knows anything. And as Œ it™s mu ch easie
r that way. And you know, it Œ to me, 
right now, it doesn™t make any difference. I 
know that he perished. So what else can 
you do? But, you know, it™s Œ it™s someth
ing that you have to live with, and 
something that you must realize, that this
 is what happened, 
that you have gone 
through some unusual circumstances, and Œ 
and you have to liv
e, because if you 
don™t, if you think about it all the time, you 
can really hurt yourself quite a bit. So 
that™s why me Œ maybe I have forgotten so
me of these things, maybe purposely, I 
don™t know. 

Q: That™s Œ 

A: But you know Œ but it™s 
one of those Œ those things
, and what difference does it 
make where he is, and if I Œ if I could find his grave or something? It™s 50 some 

years, you know, he™s gone. 
And you know, I Œ I d Œ I kn
ow he™s gone and I know 
that he™s perished at the Œ you 
know, in the territories of the 
Soviet Unio n
 and Œ 
Q: That™s it. 

A: Œ that™s satisfactory to me. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
82
Q: Did you find that wh en you were s Œ 
when you were alrea
dy Œ had you already 
left the 
Soviet Union
, or before, your mother? 
A: Yes, I think it was already in Œ in 
Teheran
 that she found out, right. And we 
have never Œ there was nev 
Œ never a trace of him, yo
u know, somebody coming out 
that knew him from the prison or something.
 Noth ing. Just gone. So  I Œ I suppose 
he mu st have died so on after he was 
deported, you know, a
nd probably  from the 
wound, because it wasn™t 
healed, at that time. 
Q: Tell me a little bit ab
out your journey from 
Almata
(ph)
 
to actually leaving the 
Soviet Unio n
. What was that like? 
A: Well, first of all, you know, once we 
were under the protection of Œ of the 
military, we began to be fed. 
Q: The Polish military. Ev
en though Œ even still in 
Kaza khstan
? 
A: In Œ in Œ still in Œ in 
Uzbekistan 
because 
Almaty
(ph) is in Œ 
Q: 
Uzbekistan
. 
A: Œ 
Uzbekistan
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yeah, so Œ so our surv
ival was Œ the possibility of survival wa
s much, much 
better terms. And then, as I said before, th
e Œ the Russians didn™t want to Œ to arm 
the Polish military, becau
se it was Œ you know, somethi
ng that they just don™t do. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
83
You do not arm the en emies, who become 
now friends, and so  Œ so they were still 
asking Americans and British to open up 
the front, and Œ and they  said, well you 
have Œ you have th
e Polish army , you have over 
100,000 troops, you know, why 
don™t you arm them? Oh, we don™t have an
ything to do. So th
e British said, well, 
then you release them. Let us take care 
of them, let us arm them, an d they can 
become a part of the second 
front when we finally open it
. So, by miracle I suppose, 
Uncle 
Stalin 
decided that yes, okay, we will do th
at. And we were released. And so 
military started moving 
[indecipherable]
 troops. 
Q: So th e first Œ the first thought had not 
been to release all of Œ not Œ not allow 
anybody to leave 
the territory, but just grou Œ re
group and form a military unit. 
A: That™s what Œ that™s what
 even the Poles wanted to 
do, because of wh at Œ they 
wanted to fight for 
Poland
, you know, as when the Russians are Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ going to start pressing westward, they 
will part of the Œ of that system. But the 
Russians didn™t trust them, because they we
re all anti-Soviet. 
Many of them had Œ 
had fought in the Œ in the war of 1920, wh en th e Soviets started pushing into  

Poland
, and were defeated, luckily. So  Œ so 
th e Œ all these troops were enemies. 
Q: And also the Œ the Œ you
 know, nobody knew about 
Katy n
 yet. Nobody knew at 
that point. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
84
A: No. Not Œ not yet. 
Q: Okay . 

A: No. And so Œ so the Œ the relationship 
was lukewarm at best. And I suppose they 
really wanted to get rid of those peopl
e too, because there Œ there would Œ you 
know, there would Œ th-they were like a Œ 
like Œ like a foreign organism within the 
system, you know, and th-there were Œ ther
e were Œ y-you know Œ I Œ I reme mb er 
there™s a little story that one of the units
, I don™t know which one it was, because I 
had it Œ I heard a story about it. But they 
were being fo rmed and a Œ and then  local 
people have come to Œ to this unit, and th
ey  said, do you Œ do you
 Œ do you play this 
Œ this hymn that Œ that is being played
 by Œ by the trumpet? 
And Œ and guy says 
what Œ oh, what a Œ wh at a di Œ this singl
e trumpeteer sings this song, you know, di 
Œ plays this song. And all of a sudden this 
Œ th is guy realizes that in the city of 
Kraków
 there is a Œ there is a Œ a church with
 a Œ with  a spire on it. And in Œ in 14 
Œ in 1200 some, when Œ when
 the Tartars and Œ and Turks s-st arted moving towards 
Poland
, they came to that town. 
And th e guy being at the t
op of th e Œ of Œ of the Œ 
of the tower, he saw it. And so he played th
-the hymn to warn th
e city to close the 
gates and Œ and protect itself.
 And Œ wh ich we did. And th
en Œ their Œ their attack 
was 
repursed Œ repursed
, and then they had to go back
, and we chased them away. 
And Œ and th ey remembered this story 
being to ld over gene
rations, because you 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
85
know, from Œ that if they hear that flo Œ 
that Œ that Œ that hymn again, they will 
become free. 
Q: So the local people cam
e to a Polish army unit Œ 
A: To ask that they 
play this Œ this Œ 
Q: Trumpet. 
A: Œ that they can be free Œ free. Well, of 
course it took another 
50 years, but they Œ 
they™re free now.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: So these Œ these stories do happen a
nd Œ and I Œ I had it in a book and I don™t 
know what happened w
ith the book, but Œ but it was written, yeah. 
Q: And you heard it Œ and y
ou heard it then, wh en you Œ 
A: After we left. 

Q: After you left. 

A: After we left, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Because it Œ you know, it would be writte
n and all that kind of stuff. But can you 
imagine now, from 1200 so mething, to have 
it believe that something like that, if Œ 
if this Œ this trumpet is played again in
 our town Œ 

Q: We can Œ  

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
86
A: Œ we™ll Œ we™ll be free. 
Q: We can Œ we can 
[indecipherable]
 yeah. We can be free. Did you travel then, 
from this place to Œ by train, or
 by horse driven carriage, or Œ 
A: No, we were Œ we were loaded  on th
e train Œ because it was, you know, quite far 
east. So, together with the military we were 
loaded on trains, and we were then sent 
all the way to Œ to the 
Caspia n Sea
, to the par Œ port of 
Krasnovodsk
. 
Q: 
Krasnovodsk
. 
A: Mm-hm. And then we were
 loaded on the ship, and we
nt south to the port of 
Baclevy
(p h), which is already on Œ on 
the Œ on the Persian territory. 
Q: What do you rememb er 
on the ship crossing over? 

A: It was packed with people. 
Q: Really? 

A: Just a Œ people were sitting on Œ on the 
Œ on the Œ not only all the Œ th-the Œ the Œ 
in-inside the ship, but also 
on Œ on the deck s. They ™re ju
st packed the people wer Œ 
as much as Œ as 
they could. So  Œ 
Q: Your mo ther and your 
Œ yourself were together? 
A: Yes, we were together. And it was Œ 
i-it Œ it happened right befo re Easter of 
1942. So, the Easter of 1942, we celebrated as free people. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
87
Q: So, when you left Œ so, 
in other word s, it was like a Œ a two year saga. You had 
been deported on April 13
th
, 1940, and two years later yo
u™re on th is boat, leaving 
the 
Soviet Unio n
. 
A: Right. Right. 
Q: Now, were you had been deported to, 
you know, that second place, were there 
others that couldn™t Œ that weren™t fr
ee? I mean, was it only Polish deportees who 
were Œ or deportees from 
Poland
 who were in this cattle breeding, or cattle herding 
town , or were there deportees from other countries that were also there? 

A: No, just Œ just Œ just 
Poland
. 
Q: So, all the Poles more or less left that place. 
A: Ay Œ ma Œ those that had the guts eno
ugh to say, we are going. But there were 
some that had little, you know, a little Œ st
arted little gardens and th -they put the 
vegetables on th ere, something like that. A
nd some decided to stay. And out of over 
a million and a half of people that 
were Œ that were deported to the 
Soviet Un ion
 
during th e Œ at the time, only co uple h
undred thousand people have moved aw ay. 
The rest of them either died, or 
had to wait until 1953 to return to 
Poland
. 
Q: Right, I see. 

A: Luckily, we were not one of them. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
88
Q: Okay, I wanted Œ thank you for filling th
at in, cause I wanted to get a sense o f 
the scope, and th at™s what you gave me right
 now, is that a million and a half people 
had been deported from thes
e eastern territories of 
Poland
. 
A: Right. 
Q: And only a couple of hundre
d thousand were able to l
eave. Now, did you have to 
have a military connection in order to be 
able to leave the co
untry? Because this 
was Œ the whole purpose was to regroup, and Œ 
A: I Œ I Œ I think so. And th is Œ and Œ and 
I think, luckily for us, because we were 
considered to be military family, just the same like Œ like this friend of mine, 
Janusz
, we were able to leave. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Some of them probably not. I don™t 
know all the stories, you know, how it Œ how 
it happened, but Œ but that™s what happened  to  us. 

Q: Okay . And on this ship, did people feel
 like they could talk
 freely? Were they 
talking all the time, were Œ 

A: All the time. Well, you Œ 
you can imagine the stories that Œ that the people were 
saying, an d Œ and you know, th
en we™re dropped in Œ in 
Baclevy
(p h) in Œ in Œ on Œ 
on the shore, and the Britis
h had already the tents prepared. The camp Œ camp 
already was being fo rmed.

Q: Was it t h e Œ excuse me, was i t the So
viets who had Œ were comm andeering the 
ship, or was it Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: It was a Œ 
A: Oh, right, it was a Soviet ship, yes. 

Q: It was a Soviet ship Œ 

A: Oh yes. 
Q: Œ and so Soviet officials? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. And, did they treat you any 
differently now that you were, you know, 
leaving the country, or were 
they distant, or were they 
rude? What were they were 
like? 

A: Oh yeah, they were always distant. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Because you are afraid that if you get 
too close to someone, that someone, like I 
told you about the son Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ may tell them that they are too frie
ndly with us, for example, you know. So  no, 
they were Œ they were a di
stance away. They did their 
duties, whatever they were

told to do, they were
 doing. So they Œ they were to
 transport all this Polish cattle, 
that was fine with them, and you know, th
ey did their Œ their duties as a seamen. 
But, you know, we were 
on the ship only, I think 
tw o or three days, so Œ 
Q: Oh. 
A: Œ this is a shi Œ it™s a short distance. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Because 
Caspia n Sea 
is a lake, huge lake, but it™s called sea. 
Q: The 
Caspian Sea
, yeah. So you™re dropped on the shore in 
Baclevy
(ph). 
A: We dropped on th e shore in 
Baclevy
(ph) and we spent East
er there, and Œ and 
the first thing you Œ y
ou had to  do is to attend, or to
 go to  Œ to be washed, and all 
your things were to be given up, because
 lice was in everybody™s clothing. And not 
just lice, hundred s of them. I remember 
one time sitting down and Œ and killing 200 
of them in one time. Just, 
ck
,
 ck
, 
ck
, you know. 
Q: This was in the 
Soviet Union [indecipherable]
 
A: This was 
Soviet Un ion
. So that™s Œ that™s why we ha
d to give up all our clothing, 
and they  were just burned. 

Q: Well here Œ I didn™t ask this before, 
but let me ask it now. You mentioned that 
when you were in the cattle 
car, in your first deportation,
 there was only a hole in 
the ground for people to take 
care of their natural functions.

A: Right. 
Q: Were you ever able to take a shower? I 
mean, this is Œ it™s su
ch a naïve question, 
but I wondered. 
A: No. 
Q: Wer Œ no. 

A: No. No, you know, it™s Œ 
you Œ you are being transpor
ted, you di Œ never knew 
when  you™re going Œ you know, you™ve ma
de a stop. Some people would go away, 
you know, to find so me, I don™
t know, food or something lik
e th at. They  come back 
and they™re Œ and they™re Œ the train was go
ne. And that™s why yo Œ a lot of families 
were lost. That™s why there were a lot of
 children that were without the parents, 
because either they died, or
 they simple Œ there were 
incidents like that, where the 
mother was left over, standing in the car, 
and you know, the trai
n was gone. So, of 
course the Œ there was no time for washing.  
Q: So what about when
 you got to where Œ to
 the first place, the 
ko lkho z
. Was there 
Œ was there Œ what were the hygi
enic facilities like there? Okay. 
A: There Œ there Œ there Œ there usually was always a 
banyo
(ph) what they called, 
or bath, probably  bath, you know, wher
e you could take the shower. But taking 
showers wasn™t a weekly oc
currence, you know, because th
ey would be closed, and

Œ or Œ or you were wo rking, or something lik
e that. So you Œ you just had to wash in 
a little bowl. 
Q: A basin. 
A: Yeah, and that™s the way it was, so ba
sically the Œ the Œ we Œ we started being 
civilized when we 
ended up in Œ in 
Baclevy
(ph). 
Q: Okay . 
A: We were cleaned up, issued new clothing, and we spend th ere, I think about two 
weeks. And then we were taken by Œ and my
 doggie, by the way, 
was with us all the 
time. 
Tito
 was there. And so, in about two week
s, we were loading Œ load ed  on a Œ 
on a trucks that were driven by the Iranian
s, and we were taken by these trucks, on a 
terrible road wh ich was climbing all th
e Œ all over the mo un
tains, across the 
mountains, and in Œ into  the 
Teheran
, wh ich is located on Œ 
on th e plains, on the Œ 
on th e south side of the Œ of the range of
 mountains. And at that time, they were 
already forming camps. And like in 
Teheran 
there were three civilian camps, and a 
military camp. So we were in
 camp number two, and we 
stayed there for about two 
years. 
Q: Well, that™s a long time. 
A: Right, and by Œ my mo ther then found 
a job ag ain as a Œ as part of a Œ of a 
quartermaster of the Œ of the camp. So sh
e was working in the camp, and right away

they reinstituted the schooling system. A
nd the Œ the camp in which we were was 
actually an unfinished factory, tha Œ with 
number of buildings that were built by the 
Germans, because Germans ha
d the very good relationshi
p with the Iranians before 
the war. And when the war broke out, 
th-the Russians, the British and the 
Americans oc-occupied  the country. Mayb
e it Œ it™s strong wor-word  to use, but 
they moved their m
ilitary forces Œ 
Q: Into 
Iran
. 
A: Œ into  
Iran
 to protect the Œ the oil fields, becaus
e they didn™t want to give to the 
Germans. So, at that time, you know, we Œ a
ll these three militari
es were present in 
Œ in 
Teheran
. 
Q: What about Œ I mean, how much interac
tion did Œ did you and 
your mo ther have 
with any of the British authorities? Was ther
e any interaction? Did they appear in 
your lives at all, or Œ 

A: No, th-there were Œ they Œ they had ad
ministration of the camp, was given to the 
Polish Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ administration. So the British were ju
st on the outside, you know, and we did 
not have anything to  do with th em.

Q: So, th e hu Œ the people who were in th
e camp Œwhen you say you were there two 
years, your Œ you™re a child. In 
1942 you™re 11 years old, right? 
A: Right. 
Q: And you stay there until you™re 13 
years old. Now Œ 
approximately.  
A: Appr Œ right. 
Q: What happened to  Œ on that boat coming 
over, there mu st have been fighting ag e 
young men. I mean, the whole purpose of releasing people from Œ from the 
Soviet 
Unio n
, was to be able to form these milita
ry units. What happen
ed to them, where 
did they  go? 

A: All Œ all Œ all the young men that Œ that
 were in the Œ in th
e military age, they 
were taken into the army, or
 the Œ they volunteered fo
r the army. And they were 
moved to  
Iraq
. So the Polish military trai
ning bases were formed in 
Iraq
. And not 
only that, but they were al
so used to protect the airf Œ th-the oil fields in 
Iraq
. So 
they Œ they were there until 
1943, I think. And then th
ey w Œ they were moved to
 
Egypt
, and from 
Egypt
 were the second front bes Œ being opened  in 
Italy
, was 
being invaded by the allied forces. They 
participated in Œ 
in that campaign. 
Q: So who Œ when you we
re in this camp in 
Teheran
 for those two years, who were 
the other people in th e camp with you? Wh at
 kind of people were they? Children? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
95
A: No, there were a lot of children, and of 
course, as I said befo
re, there were a lot 
of orphans, an-and th is Œ this Œ th-the Œ the camp s in Œ in 
Teheran
 were transito ry 
camps. So the people from there were being transported everywhere: to Œ to 
Africa
, 
to 
India
, to 
Mexico
. So  there were Œ as the people 
were coming in, so were people 
were leaving all the time, so Œ 
Q: So if you were a child, or you were 
just, you know, a Œ a young family, I would 
take it they were not military people, cau
se th e military guys, I mean, the young 
men were in different places Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ they were somewhere else. 
A: Right. They Œ so they all Œ this Œ 
so camp  number Œ camp  number one was the 
mili Œ no, camp number four 
was the military camp. But it was very small camp , 
because this was also a tran
sitory camp. And so wi Œ wh
oe Œ whatever unit came in 
from Œ from the 
Soviet Union
, they were just processe
d and moved to wh ere the 
training actually had to start, because th
ey had to retrain. Many of them were 
young, and th-they didn™t have 
any service. So they were do Œ 
Q: So th ey were doing wh
at your father would have been  training them Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ in Œ back in 
Dolina
(ph), right? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
96
A: Right, right. Except now they are Œ they 
are not 14 - 17, they
 were Œ they were, 
you know, ready to go
 into the military. 
Q: Right. 
A: And so these units were trained until 1
943, I think, where th
ey were then made 
ready for Œ for military  service. 
Q: Were there any transports 
that came after you, from the 
Soviet Unio n
 that is Œ 
A: Oh yes, yes Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ their ka Œ they kept coming, and so
 my  mo ther would Œ 
would receive those 
then, and put them in the different places 
where they had Œ they Œ not all of them 
could live in those buildings, 
and so there were also tent
s, that the British had given 
us. And so there were Œ there Œ there was 
a kitchen and, you know, the Œ everybody 
was being fed from the Œ the kitchen, and 
there were the facilities. A merican gifts 
were coming, because at the time a lot of
 people were donating things. So our 
clothing was Œ was American clothing, beca
use that™s what we have gotten from Œ 
from them. And as I mentioned 
to Œ then we started scho
ol. And there were Œ there 
were no books, so every had 
Œ everything had to be wr
itten. You had to remember 
from what Œ what the teacher was telling you. 

Q: Wow. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
97
A: Because we had no 
books. But Œ but Œ 
Q: Did you show your certif
icate from the first grade? 
A: No. But they also formed
 scouting organizations in th
e Œ and I jon Œ joined  the 
scouting. And, so actually, normal life. 
Q: I mean, from your description of it, my 
impression is that it sounds to me, if you 
take away all of the uncertainty of life, a
nd knowing that this is
 transitory, and that 
it will end Œ it also sounds like a wonderful 
place to not be alone, that there will be 
people there, that you Œ you can talk to th
em, that you could meet other kids, that 

you could make friends, that Œ you know Œ 

A: Oh yes, you know, yes. 
And Œ and on Œ in so Œ but we
 had, you know, we Œ of 
course we™re free to go, so we could go  to town. And since my mother started 

work ing we had some, you know, some of m
oney, and we were able to go to to wn . 
And the Œ the Persians, who are very frie
ndly Œ nothing like happens right now Œ 
and so we Œ we really star
ted living a normal life. We 
w ent to movies, American 
movies that were being played at Œ at 
that time. And it lasted until about 1943, 
something like that, and then th ey star
ted liquidating th e camp s because all the 
people were moved aw ay to different Œ 
different locations. And my mother then 
received a Œ a proposal to go into town and 
work for the Polish un
it that was taking 
care of the Œ of the refugees and things
. And so we moved into the city of 
Teheran
. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

We rented actually, an apartment Œ 
a Œ a room in the Œ in a Œ in 
Teheran
 itself, and 
my mother was working and I started to 
go Œ and I was going to school, and Œ 
Q: Still a Polish school. 
A: Œ to a Po lish school. And we lived not 
too far away from another friend of ours 
that is right now in 
San F ra n cisco
, and we had great time, because Œ because we 
were Œ the Œ the camp in which actually the sc Œ because the Œ they kept liquidating 
the schools, and finally ne 
Œ and Œ and that was camp  nu
mber three. And that was 
located in the mountains, ve
ry beautiful area. And we™d 
have a bus that would take 
us there, and in the even ing we would be 
driven back ag ain. And so I went thro ugh 
Œ thro ugh the grade school, and in Œ 
in 1945, when we moved to  i Œ to 
Lebanon
, I 
was already in first grade of high school. 

Q: Really? 

A: Right. 

Q: As 13 -14 Œ well, right on Œ 
A: Yeah, 13 - 14 Œ 
Q: Œ right on schedule. 

A: Right. Right on schedule, I was 14. A
nd so  I rememb er that, you know, we had Œ 
we had great time, because several of us 
lived in Œ in a city by then, and we c Œ 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
99
could get together, go to the movies, and 
Œ and you know, and visit the bazaars, and 
Œ and really had great time. 

Q: It sounds like exotic, and adventurous, right? 
A: Abso lutely, yeah
, show my Œ my 
[indecipherable]
. But abso lutely adventurous, 
because we were Œ we we
re taken one time to visit the Shah™s palace. 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: And I also rememb er that we were re
turning one time, and I don™t know what Œ 
how Œ how was it, but we decided to walk. 
It wasn™t that far away, so we were 
walking on Œ on the road towards 
Teheran
, and here comes the Shah. So we waved, 
you know, and all th
at stuff, and he Œ 
Q: Was he in a motorcade? 

A: Yes, in Œ in a limousine, you know, moto
rcades and all that kind stuff. So Œ and 
he mu st have realized that Œ who we ar
e, because he wa Œ you know, waved back. 

So, you know, he Œ then Œ then  we absolu
tely felt like free pe
ople. A-And our Œ our 
Œ our wrong 
[indecipherable]
 was over. And so Œ so  Œ yo
u know, then, towards the 
end of Œ almo st at the end of the war, in 
July of 1945, because everything was being 
liquidated and, you kn
ow, the British and the Americans 
were going to move out of 
there too, we were
 taken by train to 
Bag hda d 
in 
Iraq
. And there we had to stay for 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
100
two weeks because something 
happened with our visa, tr
ansitory visa through Œ 
through one of the countries. 
Q: So this is from 
Teheran 
to 
Bag hdad
. 
A: To 
Ba ghda d
. 
Q: And then after that, 
Lebanon
? 
A: And then from Œ from 
Bag hda d
 we went to 
Leba non
, and we went in Œ in 
buses, all the way to Œ to 
Beirut
. 
Q: How long did that take? 

A: A couple days. It was Œ it was quite the trip.  

Q: Do you remember what 
you saw through the buses, a
nd what kind of landscape Œ 
A: Sand and sand and sand. It
 was a real desert. Until we 
came to Œ to Œ to Œ to 
Leba no n
. And 
Lebanon
 is Œ is beautiful. It™s green, you know, the Œ the mountains 
are Œ are beautiful, and so it was complete
ly different land Œ you know, landscape 
once we entered the territory of 
Lebanon
. So from Œ from bay Œ from 
Baghdad
 I 
remember that we had an opportunity
 to visit the Œ you
 know, the Œ the 
marketplaces, the Œ the Œ you know, and it wa
s Œ it was really quite an experience, 
and I Œ I don™t know wh ere I have it, but 
I bought my self a Œ a Œ a Œ one of these 
knifes, you know, that you Œ 

Q: Oh, th e long knives? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
101
A: Œ you see 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: The Œ the curved knives? 
A: Yes, the curved knif
e, I still have it. So Œ 
Q: Was this a Œ all of these journeys, from 
Teheran
 to  
Ba ghdad
 to now 
Beirut
, 
this was all under the aegis of Polish au
thorities, and they  in turn  were under th e 
aegis of the British authorities? 

A: No, this was already beginning of th
e international ref-refugee organization.  
Q: Okay . 

A: Because that was the end of th e war, a
nd all of a sudden they had refugees all 
over 
Europe
, so they formed 
this international refugee or
ganization, and they  took 
over the administration. 

Q: I see. 

A: So, once we moved to Œ to 
Beirut
, and we stayed couple 
Œ couple weeks in Œ in 
a transitory camp in 
Beirut 
itself, and then we were m
oved to a small town called 
Ghazir
(ph), just north of Œ of 
Beirut
, in the mountains. And at that time we were 
given some substis Œ subsiste
nce money so  we could go on our own. So  we became 
self-sufficient, and we had 
to su pply ourselves with food and Œ an d Œ and, you 
know, and clothing and Œ

stopped Œ 
A: Stopped. 
Q: Œ wh en Œ wh en you left 
Teheran
. 
A: Right. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And Œ and in  
Lebanon
, the Œ one of the Œ as I unde
rstand, one of the agreements 
with the Lebanese government was that th
e people that are coming in are not going 
to become part of the economy of the Œ of 
Lebanon
. But they are Œ they are going 
to be self-sufficient. So Œ so that™s we 
Œ that™s why we are ne
eding the subsistence, 
so we can live on our own. 

Q: And how long did 
you stay there? 
A: Until 1950. 

Q: Oh, you were there for five years? 
A: Five years. Yes, so I graduated, a

Q: 1948. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Also in 
Leba no n
. 
A: Right, but it Œ this was Œ this wa Œ th
e Œ the Œ after people started leaving there, 
too, they  started liquidating different 
camp s, and so we had to move from 
Ghazir
, 
which is in the mountains, to 
Zo u k
(ph), which was on the bay. And so this is 1948, 
plus two years, 1950. 
Q: So, in  Œ when  you lived in th ese 
places, were you also  in an en closed 
community, or did you liv
e in town , having your own rooms, or Œ 
A: Oh no, we had Œ we Œ yes, we rented

January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
105
A: Yes, well, en-enough to  Œ to fo rm seve
ral schools. Like there was one in Œ in 
Ghazir
, there was one in 
Zo u k
 and there was one in Œ in the mountains on th e other 
side of 
Beirut
. And t-then they started liquidating,
 and everything was then put into 
Œ into 
Zo u k
. 
Q: Did you also have mu ch cont
act with local people? Lebanese? 

A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I Œ in a way 
that th-they were friendly people, and th-
they were Œ they were rea
lly amazingly capable of learning languages, because you 
know, they had a long history of being tr
aders. And so this Œ so this became a 
natural with them. So
 most of the people that ha
d any Œ any shops in like Œ in 
Ghazir
, they s Œ they spoke ad
equate Polish to tell you 
that, for example, they 
would c-call, pig missus, pig missus. It wa
sn™t that the missus 
was a pig, but they  
killed the pig, and they were sellin g the me
at. So Œ so Œ but Œ 
but they were very, 
very nice, very polite, and a 
friend of mine who lives in

ere decided to make a round 
world trip. And they went

la Œ they look different. And so the Œ he 
says, what are you ladies doing in here? 
And my friend says, well, I™m the 
wife of, you know, this Œ this 
[indecipherable]
 
you know, we are Polish, we lived here. 
Oh , you are Polish. So you Œ stands at 
attention, and starts si
nging Po lish national anthem. 
Q: Oh good God. 
A: He remembered, all these years. So th
ey are Œ they™re really fantastic people. 
And Œ you know, and we neve
r, never had anything th at we would be afraid of. We 
lived among them, being scout, we Œ we 
went on Œ on the trips, you know, just 
walking trips around 
Leba no n
, and we never had any problem at all. 
Q: Did you ever pick up the local language? 
A: Some. Yo-Y ou know en ough to kind of 
get Œ get along it, and Œ but of course, 
over the years of not using it, it Œ it Œ it ju
st disappears. I just reme mber Leban Œ 
Lebanese national anthem.  

Q: You remember Œ so if you were to 
walk around, you™d be able to sing it. 
A: But Œ but you know, it Œ they were rea
lly very friendly people and they were Œ 
after the first World War they were under 
what they called French protectorate. So 
all Œ almost everyone spoke 
French. There was also Americ
an university in Œ in Œ in 
pa Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Beirut
, and some of our older me mb ers of the school went to study 
in there, and Œ but then , you 
know, towards the Œ the 1950 Œ

Q: What did your mother do
 for the five years? How 
did she support herself? 
A: Well, she was Œ she Œ you know, we we
re Œ we were given the money, but she 
started working for, you know, with the scho
ol, doing all kinds of things, being able 
to paint, you know, she would Œ she would 
take care, and she was really taking care 
of like a Œ like a club for children, and they
 were dancing, and things like that. So 
she was busy all the time. You kno
w, she Œ she had things to do. 
Q: Did you ever see her, in all of those y
ears, those 10 years, did you ever see her 
despair? 

A: No. I think after you go 
thro ugh something like that, you could have done all the 
desperation in two years. The rest of itwas a wonderful life, basically. You know, 
of course you didn™t know anything ab ou
t your husband, you were lonely , no 
family, and Œ but there are people like you 
that became, you know, part of your 
circle. And so she never despaired, and 
Œ and I think sh e Œ she was Œ she was too 
busy to Œ to think. And then besides, sh
e could Œ she co uld, you know, embroider, 
so she would embroider. She wrote poems
, which Œ wh ich I have, you know. And 
so she was quite a positive type of person. 
So Œ so anyway, so af
ter Œ after all this 
was done and Œ and told her that Œ that they
 were trying to relocate the people as 
soon as possible so they can start normal 
life, because this was not a normal life. 
Q: Right.

A: So finally in Œ in a Œ in
 1950, towards the Œ the end of 
1950, in July in fact, Her 
Majesty the queen  decided to accep t us as
 Œ as being capable of going to  the 
territory of the Œ of 
Great Britain
. 
Q: Had you been trying for a long 
time? Had your mo ther been trying? 
A: No, no, this was all done between the 
Polish government and the British. They Œ 
they realized that they have
 to remove those people from 
Leba no n 
because they 
had Œ they  had an  agreement that 
they won™t work . So  wh at do you Œ 
Q: Well that can™t happen forever. 
A: No, that can™t happen fo
rever. So  they decided that 
the best way is to simply 
bring them to Œ to real life. Really real 
life, not what we have for life for the last 
number of years. So, we were load Œ load
ed on the sh i Œ on the military ship. And 
you know, on a transport ship in 
Beirut
, and moved acro ss the 
Mediterranean Sea
 
and up north to Œ to  
Great Britain
, and we were unloaded w
ith Œ in the Œ the port 
of 
Hull
, 
h
-
u-l-l
, and then transp orted to a milita
ry camp , a post-military camp in 
north ern 
England
, on the border with 
Scotland
. 
Q: Oh, I™ve been to 
Hu ll
.  
A: The so-called Œ so-called 
[indecipherable]
 district 
Q: Oh yeah, it™s a very pretty district. 

A: Very pretty district. We were 
within walking dist
ance from there.

Q: Oh my. Oh my. 
A: So it was Œ it was really something, and 
there was nothing to 
do there, you know, 
I could dig ditches. And I wa
s not about to dig ditches. 
Q: Well, by now you™re a young man, you™re Œ 

A: Right, I was Œ I was Œ you 
know. And so my mother called 
Rilka
(ph) Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ in 
Londo n
, and she said, yes, of course he can come to Œ to 
London
. 
Q: I™ll take him to see 
Errol Œ Errol Flynn
. 
A: Right. No, that was later. 

Q: Oh, th at was later. 
A: That was later. So Œ so I moved to 
London
, my mother stayed in the camp, and I 
started looking fo r a job. And th ere was a Œ the Polish 
[indecipherable]
 units 
formed a Œ like a Œ like a organization, and on
e of those things that they were doing 
was Œ was employment. And so  I went to their employment office and Œ 

Q: Did you speak any English at that point? 
A: Yes. Oh, by the way, I Œ 
I Œ we did learn English in 
Leba no n
. We had th e 
Lebanese professor who was 
teaching us. So I-I Œ I cannot say I was fluent, but I 
was capable of communicating quite well Œ 
Q: Okay .

110
A: Œ in Œ in English. Not with a British 
accen t, of course, but Œ but nevertheless, 
enough to  be able to move ab out 
England
 with no problem. And so, when I moved 
to 
London
, I was with 
Rilka
(ph) for a little w h ile, and then she arranged for me to 
go to  a youth hostel, and I was wo rking in  
a youth hostel. So I started looking for 
job and Œ and th e Œ the guy said, well, ther
e™s something that you can Œ you can do, 
there is some factory that you can go 
in. So I went for an
 interview and the 
gentleman that was interviewing me, he said
, what do you want 
to do in life? And I 
said, what Œ I would like to be an  engine
er. And he says, oh, I™m sorry, I™m looking 
for a worker, not for 
an engineer. So Œ 
Q: So it sounds like it 
was a trick question. 
A: I suppose. But Œ so I was Œ I was Œ I 
had to go back , and they  said, you know, 
there is Œ there is a Œ an office of a Œ of
 a Œ a Polish American, who was born in Œ in 
United States
, but was educated in 
Poland
. He became an engineer, and he worked 
in the Po lish corp s of engineer in Œ 
wh en Œ during the camp aign in Œ in 
Italy
, and 
there he met a British engineer who was wo rking for the British corps of engineers, 
and they  formed fre Œ friendship, and they
 decided that they liked  each other so  
much that ti Œ after Œ after the war, they op
ened an office. And that office was to  
convert ma ny of the residences of 
London
 into flats. 
Q: Oh wow. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
111
A: So th ey were doing this kind of wo
rk, and when I Œ wh
en I went for an 
interview, the gentleman said yes Œ and be
cause I Œ and when  I graduated from high 
school, there was an Polish engineer who 
taught the boys the 
drafting. So I knew 
about eng-engineering drawings, I knew 
about drafting, I know ab out, you know, 
things. And so he gave me the opportunity 
to work for them, as 
my  first engineering 
job. 
Q: Oh, how wonderful. 
A: And it was really fantastic, because, you 
know Œ but my  mo ther
 told me in the 
beginning of my  career that, just rememb er 
to Œ when  you work  for someone, take a 
letter of recommendation from the person. 
And so they Œ so I Œ when I was in 

London
 mat Œ from Œ I think from September or
 something like that, and we left for 
the 
United States
 in the beginning of February Œ 
Q: Which year? 

A: Œ of 1951. So we were in 
England
 only several months. And what happened is 
that my  mo ther had ta Œ three uncles. My Œ my  grandmother came from a family of 

12. 

Q: See, I hadn't that far Œ back enough, 
wh en I was asking you about your parents, 
your grandparents and so on, I didn™t ask 
how many children were
 in those families, 
or that generation. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

112
A: Well, that™s Œ that™s my Œ my
 grandmother had 
Œ had 11 siblings. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: And Œ and th ree of those si
blings, all boys, escaped to the 
United States
 in Œ 
before the beginning of the 
second war Œ or the first Wo
rld War. Because, when 
you are drafted into the Russian army , your 
career lasted 25 years, so all your life, 
basically. And so they  didn™t want to Œ to  
do that, and these Œ they Œ they came to 
the 
United States
, and one of them settled in 
Baltimore
, and the other one settled 
in Œ in 
Ohio
, and the third one somewhere in 
Ohio
 also. And when we Œ when we 
left 
Russia
, my mother somehow reestablishe
d contact with him, and Œ Uncle 
Miczes
aw
(ph) and he asked her, couple years la
ter, if w e would 
be wanting maybe 
to emigrate to the 
United States
, and my  mother said yes. But in those days, they Œ 
they had the visa Œ no-not 
the visa, but they had like 
every nationality had a number 
of places assigned. 
Q: A quota. 
A: A quota. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And so she Œ the Po lish quota was al
ways, you know, taken up. So  we just 
simp ly waiting all this period, from, you 
know, we Œ we started doing th is in 
Teheran
, and he had to write the affidav
its and all that kind of stuff Œ

113
Q: That™s a long time. 
A: Yes. 

Q: That™s like six or seven years. 
A: Yes, and it still would have taken longer
 time, but the American government had 
passed a special law th at permitted 18,
000 military families 
to come to the 
United 
States
 for set Œ 
Q: Polish military families. 
A: Right, from Œ from the seco
nd Polish corps, to Œ to 
[indecipherable]
 units to Œ 
to immigrate to the 
United States
. And si Œ again, since my  father was counted as a 
military, we were give
n the opportunity Œ 
Q: Excuse me to interrupting here, but you
 Œ I Œ I take it that your mo ther didn™t 
have many documents with her. Did she have
 a document that said that her Œ that 
your father was in the military, or were there other ways they
 could substantiate 
that? 

A: No, she Œ there was Œ there was so
mething that yes, she Œ she had the 
substantiation. Cause we Œ we
 do have some documents of
 Œ of my father, and I Œ 
see the Œ here™s the Œ the Œ the certificate, 
he graduated from the Œ from the officers™ 
school.

like that. Can you ze
ro in on it? Yeah, 
got it? Okay . Ok ay, thank you. 
A: You know, so Œ 
Q: So sh e had documentation. 
A: So, she had the documenta
tion and you know, several other things that Œ that she 

had, you know, so she could 
prove that my father was Œ 
was in the military. And so  
we were Œ we were granted 
the visa, as part o f the 18,
000 permissions. And so on Œ 
on February Œ beginning of Fe
bruary, we were loaded on
to one of Her Majesty™s 
ships, and sh ipped from 
Liverpool 
to 
Lo ndo n 
Œ to Œ to 
New York
. So the trip 
lasted, I think ab out 14 days or something like that. So we arrived in 
New York
 on 
February 14
th
 Œ 
Q: Nineteen  Œ 

A: Œ 
Valentine™s Day
, and everybody was, you 
know, saying, oh, Happy 
Valentin e
, and we didn™t know what Œ 
Q: What it was. 

A: So it was. But we learned. And my  Œ my
 Œ my mother™s uncle™s wife had family 
in Œ in 
New York
. So they came out to take us
 from the ship. And I still have a 
busin ess card of the cousin, that he showed  th
em to Œ so he took us Œ he took us to 
his home, and we stayed in 
New Yo rk
 for several days. And Œ

Ellis Island
? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, we didn™t, we Œ I don™t know wh
y, maybe because we came  from England 
or something, but we were Œ the re

Q: I see, okay. 

A: And so he took us
 from the Œ from the Œ 
Q: Pier. 
A: Œ pier, he took us to Œ to his house. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And permitted us to kind of release a l
ittle bit after th e Œ afte
r the trip. And then 
loaded us on the 
Œ on the train and shipped us to 
Ohio
. 
Q: To 
Ohio
, so you didn™t even go to 
Baltimore
? 
A: No. No, we went directly to 
Ohio
, and my  uncle pick ed us up at the train station 
in Œ across the border for Œ in Œ in 
Pittsburgh
.

116
A: In 
Pittsburgh
, and then he took us bri Œ by car 
to his house, and we st Œ we were 
staying with them. Unfortunat
ely, the first ex perience wa
s not the most sati sf actory, 
because after about four months Œ and I star
ted work ing in Œ in  ice cream factory, I 
was making the 
Popsicles
. But this was my  Œ my  firs
t job. And after about four 
months, my uncle called my  mo ther and he 
says, you know, my  wife, your aunt, and 
you just don™t seem to be
 getting too well together. So
, he says, you know, you Œ 
you have to leave. 
Q: Oh dear. Oh dear. 
A: So, we started looking fo r a place, you 
know, since I was already employed. We 
started looking fo r a place, but then my  mo th
er decided to call the uncle that lives in 
Œ lived in 
Baltimore
, and maybe they could just take us for, you know 
[indecipherable]
 four months, you know, just a new country, everything Œ so  wi Œ 
the cousin came in and she looked us ove
r, and sh e decided we™re okay, and so Œ 

Q: That mu st have been  hard . 
A: Hm? 
Q: That mu st have been  hard . 

A: Well, ya Œ hey, once you go through Œ

Q: I know. Okay, fine, okay. 
A: And so, w-we moved to 
Baltimore
, and we stayed with 
them, I think about a 
month maybe, maybe less. And my  Œ my  co usin says, you know, I Œ I don™t know 
what to do with you, you kn
ow, wh -what am I do Œ we don™t even  know how to 
help you completely two different worlds. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You know. And so sh e says, but you know,
 but there is Œ there is a Polish priest 
that went through German concentration ca
mp. He is working in
 the parish right 
here. Maybe we take you th ere, and maybe
 you can Œ maybe you can find a better 
communication with  him, maybe he can help
 you better than Œ than  I. So she took 
us Œ she took me there, and we Œ I met the priest. 
Q: Do you remember whos
 Œ what his name  was? 
A: I have it written down somewhere, but I Œ I didn™t Œ 

A2: 
Fillipovich
(ph). 
A: Oh, Father 
Fillipovich

A2: Fath er 
Fillipovich

[indecipherable]
 
A: 
Fillipovich
(ph). He was Œ he was really Œ yo
u know, he went th rough different 
kind of 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
118
A: And so he understood. 
And he said, you know, sinc
e you were wo rking as a 
draftsman, we are Œ we are running a Œ 
a bazaar here, you know, and th ere is a 
gentleman that Œ that works for 
Bethlehem Steel Corporation
. Maybe he can help 
you. So  the next day I Œ I came in and he 
to Œ introduced me to the guy, and th e guy 
says well Œ he was Œ he was Polish, second 
generation, I think, but he spoke Polish 
and he says well, let me see if there is 
some thing I can do. And so he gave me the 
address. The next day I went by trai
n or something to 
what they call the 
Sparrows 
Point
. 
Sparrows Point
 was where they had the shipyards, and Œ and the Œ th e Œ you 
know, regular steel comp any th ing. And so I 
Œ I Œ I talked to th
e Œ to the gentleman 
that was in charge of engineering offi
ce. I showed  him my  document from Œ from 
England
. 
Q: Your letter of recommendation. 
A: My letter of recommendation. And the 
next day th ey Œ the fellow says, you 
know, you can Œ you can come 
and start working. So  Œ so  within  couple days I Œ I 
was already employed 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What a relief. 

A: Œ in what I wanted to 
do, you know, so it just fant
astic. And when
 I Œ when I 
came back, my  aunt says, your mo ther isn™t here any mo re. She rented an ap artment

119
and she Œ she™s waiting for you with Œ with 
su pper, so you better go over there. So I 
Œ from that point on we were Œ 
Q: On your own. 
A: Œ on Œ independen t, on our
 own. Wh ich was, of course
, the best thing that could 
happen to  anyone. We Œ we kept a very 
good relationship with Œ with Œ with the 
uncle. And so I still maintain a relationshi
p with Œ with his 
grandchildren, you 
know, talk to each other and things
. And I Œ and I st
arted working at 
Sparrows 
Point
 of the 
Bethlehe-Bethlehem  Steel Corporation
. And had a fantastic 
experience, because you know, it™s something that Œ 
Q: It™s what you wanted to do. 
A: Œ some Œ wanted to do, I wanted to do 
the engineering. And so, soon as possible, 
I Œ I signed up fo r the civil engineering 
studies, the evening of course, at 
Johns 
Hopkins University 
in 
Baltimore
. So I™d work, come ba
ck from work, go to 
school. And I comp leted quite a number of
 courses, and then in 19 Œ middle Œ 
towards the end of 1954
, I got the papers from 
U
.
S
. military that I™m being drafted. 
Q: Were you a citizen yet? 
A: No. 
Q: Okay . 
A: That™s another story. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
120
Q: Okay . 
A: So, I was finally drafted in the beginn
ing of 1955, and after Œ after the basic 
training of eight weeks, our
 regiment was shipped to  
Germany
. Because at that 
time, the regiment that was there Œ and it wa
s Œ they had the Œ th e duties of Œ of Œ of 
Œ of watching th e border. 

Q: East-west border? 

A: East-west border, yes. And that regiment 
stayed there as Œ as Œ regiment as a, 
you know, unit, all the time 
from the be Œ the end of th e war until 1955, beginning. 
And then  they decided to ex
change the units, move second regiment back to sh Œ to 

Œ to the 
United States
, and us, as a whole regiment, 
ship over there. So we were 
shipped as a regiment to 
Germany
. And since I got the job as a Œ as a regimental 
draftsman, of course, I was in a head
quarters of the regiment in Œ in 
Nuremberg
, 
whereas the Œ the battalions were sh Œ were
 s-stationed around the border. So it was 
Œ it was interesting because it was di
fferent kinds of draftsmanship. 
Q: What were you doing? 

A: Doing military plans when 
they they were doing their, 
you know, their exercises, 
I had to Œ to Œ to document
 where they™re going to be, and what time, and what 
units and all that kind of
 stuff. It got to be 
[indeciphera ble]
. So I worked Œ I was 
working there. And I remember o n e Œ 
one time, the sergeant of Œ of the 
S-2
 section, 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
121
which is the intelligence secti
on, comes to Œ to Œ to the room that I was occupying, 
and he looks at me, and he looks at Œ at th
e Œ the plans that I am
 working on, and he 
says, are you a 
U
.
S
. citizen? And I said no. So he said, oh my God. He runs to the 
colonel, tells him the story, and the col
onel does whatever necessary, and within 
two week s, I was shipped to 
Frankfurt
, 
Germany
, where the American consulate 
was, with two sergeants that sw
ore that they knew me since. 
Q: And they  had never seen you before, huh? 
A: No. And I was given the 
U
.
S
. citizenship. So Œ so Œ so
 when I came back from 
the army, I was, you know, I was already Œ 
Q: A 
U
.
S
. citizen. 
A: Œ a registered citizen. And Œ and it rea
lly helped me quite 
a bit because sometime 
later the same sergeant come
s in and he says, do you 
speak a little Russian? And I 
said yes, I do. And he says
, oh, would you like to go 
to a refresher course in 
Russia
? And I say yes, of course. So I was 
shipped, for three weeks of Russian 
refresher course, in 
Ob era mmerg au
, 
Germany
, and you probab ly know 
Oberammergau 
is a place where every 10 years th
ey give the Œ the Easter thing. 
Q: The Passion Play. 
A: Passion Play. 
Q: Yeah.

122
A: And it is a beautiful, beautiful town wh
ere everybody there is
 a sculptor. They  
sculpt, you know, in wood
. So I spent thr
ee weeks with Œ w
ith the military 
intelligence refresher course. And it was am
azing experience for me because the Œ 
the people that were with me, they we
re from Œ you know, 
from private through 
major. 
Q: Wow. 

A: And all of them went through th e army  
school of languages, and they want Œ an-
and you know all these people
 were going Œ if necessary were going to be used as 
interrogators of the prisoners of war. So
 their basic Russia n  was based on the 
military requirements, you kn
ow, in other words, what 
Œ what do you ask, you 
know Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ and all that kind of stuff. So they Œ 
they had to maintain 
their skill. So they 
were there and the first few 
days, you know, they were 
way ahead of me. And then, 
all of a sudden, s-s-star
ted clicking, you know. 

Q: Your first grade. 

A: My first grade started clicking back
. And by the time we were e Œ we were 
finished, I was way ahead of them
, because my pronunciation was 
[indeciphera ble]
 
better than th-theirs. And Œ and you know, 
I had the opportunity 
to Œ to visit that

wonderful place, and I Œ since they were do
ing all these kind of things that my 
mother always told Œ told me that, you ha
ve to have, in your 
house, you have to 
have a picture of Ou r Lady feeding th e baby 
Jesus
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And so I had that remembrance, so I went
 to one of the sculptors, and I said, did 

you ever make the sculpture of
 Our Lady feeding the baby 
Jesus
? And he says, no, 
but that™s interesting. He says, come, come
, come, come. So he took me to his Œ to 
his workplace, and he starts pulling out th
e books, trying to figure out, you know. 
And he finds a Œ a picture of lady Œ Ou r Lady feeding the baby 
Jesus
. And he says, 
you know, I™ll Œ I™ll Œ I™ll put you on 
ro ck Œ o-on the rock and Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 this, and she™s going to  be feeding baby 
Jesus
. Is that Œ is that 
what you want? Excuse me, 
ca-can you sneak out and go and get that sculpture? 
Q: Can you cut the panel, please?
 [break]
 And so, what™s that? 
A: So this is the Œ this is the sculpture that he made. 

Q: Oh my  goodness. Oh my  goodness. 
A: And Œ and th -there are onl
y two of those like that. One painted, and th e other one 
just as in wood. And he sent me
 b o th, to Œ to 
the Œ to Œ to 
Nuremberg
, and he says, 
which one do you want? And I 
bought both, and the other 
one I send to my  cousin 
in 
Poland
. So they have that.

Q: Oh, my  gosh. 
A: But Œ but all Œ you know, th
e only thing that he showed  me was this po Œ upper 
part. And the rest of it, with her putting her li Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 on doing Œ and doing, that was 
all she Œ all his interpretation. 
And so, this is what Œ what I remember from 
Oberammergau
. 
Q: From 
Oberammergau
. Well, thank you for sharing 
that. That Œ did you explain 
to the people where you were taking th e Ru
ssian refresher course that Œ how you 
came to know Russian to begin with? 
A: Yes. But, you know, that Œ basically
, you know, I Œ I found out that mo st 
Americans are not interested in that, be
cause it™s Œ it™s so far away from their 

background, from their pe Œ that you s-si
mp ly do not understand,
 that how in the 
heck Œ excu se me Œ my English Œ you can 
come to some body™s home at two o™clock 
in the mo rning and take him away, and 
leave everything Œ you know, you leave 
everything behind. It was just in Œ incomp
rehensible. And so  there Œ they were not 
interested. And so therefore,
 you know, I just kept it to my self, and I don™t have 
anything against it, because it is so differe
nt. You know, how do 
you explain to Œ to 
people that never experien
ced any kind of a Œ of 
[indecipherable]
 with authorities, 
that somebody can come to your house at 
two o™clock in the mo rning and take you

125
away, leave all your things behind, and, you 
know. Bu t Œ but I explained to Œ to this 
Œ to these guys, and they accepted what it was. 
Q: Was there a reason why they  would ha
ve wanted you to 
take this Russian 
refresher course? Did they ha
ve anything in mind for you? 
A: Well, because I was wer Œ working for the regiment. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And the regiment was on the border, so 
they needed people that were familiar 
with the language, just in case Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ if some Œ something sh ould happen,
 each unit had a translator that could 
interrogate the people. And here™s a guy that
 not only that experienced being there Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and knowing th e people. And so I was 
very grateful. But then I suffered some 
Œ somehow, later on, because when ever we would go to 
Canada
, and I take my  
citizenship papers with me, I was always
 stopped on th e border, and I Œ and th ere 
was also a telephone call made to 
Washin gton
, because my  Œ my  paper, my  Œ my  
citizenship paper is not the normal thing.
 It does not have my  photograph, it does 
not have sig Œ signature of Œ 
of Œ of a judge. It has a si
gnature of Consul General of 
the 
United States
 and 
Frankfurt
, 
Germany
, and it just doesn ™t sound normal. So Œ 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
126
Q: Okay. It wasn™t what th ey were used to seeing. 
A: So it was Œ it was always checked, and 
finally I decided, wh at am I doing, why 
don™t I just get a passpor
t and be done with  it. 
Q: And you did. 
A: And I did and ever since then I was Œ it was okay. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So, you know, a-all thes
e experiences add up to Œ to
 a Œ I would say a rather 
interesting life, if you want to call it that 
way. And then , when  I was drafted into the 
army , I d ecid ed  to  mov e my  mo th er to  
Chica go
, because here we Œ we have many 
mo re friends and people that we Œ acquainta
nces that we had from the past. And so 
I moved her, and then  I went back and was 
drafted. And when I was released I came 
back, and I restarted my studies at 
Illinois Institute of Technology
, and I started 
work ing as a draftsman for engineering fi
rms. And my first firm of employment 
was a fi Œ was a firm of Œ in Œ in whic
h our chief engineer was Lithuanian. And 
most of the draftsmen were lith Œ were
 Lithuanians. So, that was my Œ my 
beginning of a career in 
Chicago
. 
Q: Well, did they ev er Œ did they ev er discuss the 
[indecipherable]
 with you? 
A: No. 
Q: The treaty of 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
127
A: No, no, and interesting thing is that
 Œ that once the Polish army  had left 
Soviet 
Unio n
, the 
Soviet Unio n
 fo rmed another army , which was the Œ an Œ a new 
government Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ of 
Lublin
, and a new army . And that
 army fought with the 
Sov i et Unio n
, and 
a Œ you know, participated
 in the liberation of 
Poland
. And of course, the 
Anders™ 
Army 
was a traitor. So Œ but it was Œ it was, 
you know, an interesting experience, 
because I already had something to show. Th
at not only that I did get the document 
from Œ from the army  that I worked as a dr
aftsman, so Œ and wh en  I Œ wh en I came 
to the Œ to Œ to 
Chicag o
, I started working for several 
firms, and the wa Œ and again 
for 
U
.
S
.
 Steel Corporation
, because th Œ I was already with experience from Œ 
from Œ 

Q: From 
Baltimore
. 
A: Œ from 
Baltimore
, from 
Bethlehem Steel
. And I work ed in different engineering 
firms until 1978. And in ™78, I Œ I read 
an advertisement in a civil engineering 
magazine, a re Œ and th e Federal Ener
gy Regulatory Co mmissi
on had been looking 
for personnel. And so I went for an inte
rview, and because my  background was civil 
engineering, and it was also in Œ in Œ in
 dams, because the last firm that I was 

working for was a firm of Dr. 
Bauer
(ph), who had, you know, his doctorate in 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

hydraulics, and so I worked on Œ on things
. And so  I was accepted. And so in 1978 
until 2008, for 30 y
ears, I worked for 
U
.
S
. un-unit. And that was really fantastic 
experience, too, because we Œ there were five offices lik e that, and 
Chicago
 office 
had the Middle East Œ the mi Œ mi  Œ middle west. 
Q: Midwest, mm-hm. 

A: And so we had, you know,
 a number of dams. And so, 
all these thir Œ 30 years 
that I worked, I haven™t visited all the Œ all the dams. 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: So there™s Œ there™s qu
ite a numb er, and people always say what? Tell me? You 
know, but there are hundreds of dams th
at are run not only by th e Corp s of 
Engineers, but also by private industry
, wh ere they have, you know, hydraulic 
facilities. A nd because 
they Œ they are using the waters of the 
United States
, they 

are obligated to take a license and to fu
lfill the requirements, 
and we wo
uld go and 
visit and see if everything is okay, and if
 not, we would write down what we find 
that is Œ needs to be repaired, and they 
were obligated to do th
at. So, it was Œ it was 
Œ 

Q: Sounds like an interesting Œ interesting job. 
A: Oh Œ oh, it was Œ it was very interes
ting, and you never ge
t tired, because you 
know, a dam is a dam and a Œ a Œ and a plan
t is a plant. No, it™s not. Each one is 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

129
different, each one has separate problems, 
or arrangements or whatever. And Œ and 
you know Œ and to Œ 
y-you Œ like if you going to a di
fferent Œ different Œ different 
thing to do every time yo
u go, cause it™s different. 
Q: Did you think mu ch  about those two year
s of deportation throughout your life, or 
do you kind of push it to the past? 
A: I try to push it to the past, because I 
don™t think that Œ well, it™s n o t my nature, 
you know. And Œ and beside
s, I™ve read so many times when  people are reliving 
their Œ their past, and especially if the 
past is not a pleasant one, you are unhappy. 
You are Œ you are always under this Œ this 
influence of th is Œ these horrible years, 
when  you starved to death, when  you were
 beating 200, you know, lice a day. When  
your mo ther almo st died, you know, and 
where you were just by a Œ by a miracle, 
taken away from there. Because you know, I 
do not consider it any different but just 

miracle, that we just happened to  be in the 
right place, at the right time, so that we 
could leave that, you know, wo nderful life of the 
Soviet Unio n
, you know. And so I 
Œ I don™t want to think about it. I 
know I had that experience, but Œ 
Q: Did you ever wonder why 
you Œ why you were able to 
leave, and others didn™t, 
couldn™t? 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
130
A: I asked, but I didn™t get a answer, you 
know, and Œ and Œ but I pray daily, thank 
Him for that Œ for that oppo
rtunity to be able to leave. Because I know that we 
would not have surv ived the 
next winter, you know. And Œ 
Q: You were too weak . Your mother was too Œ 
A: My mother and I. And if we were, the 
next winter and th e next winter and the 
next winter would have been the same, 
you know. So  Œ and it took th e re-remaining 
of those people that were deported, thos
e that survived, they
 didn™t have an 
opportunity to return po Œ to 
Poland
 until 1953. And we left
 1942. So that™s 11 
mo re years of that kind of living, whereas I was saved that/ 

Q: And just to Œ so that people will un
derstand, can you expl
ain why they would 
have been able to leav
e in 1953? What 
event allowed that to happen? 
A: Uncle 
Stalin
 died. And so Œ 
Q: And that meant? 

A: Œ the changes begin Œ be
gan to Œ to occur in the 
Soviet Union
. 
Q: I see. 

A: And at that time ap parently, the Polish government in 
Poland
 Œ 
Q: The communist govern ment. 
A: Œ would have been  able to Œ to obtai
n release for those people. And so th-the 
remn ants of those deported Œ an d people 
are not only deported in Œ in Œ wh en  I was 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
131
deported, there were hundreds
 of them, thousands of th em
 were also deported, you 
know, as the Russians moved in  the Œ in th e push on 
Germany
. So Œ 
Q: You mean on the attack on 
Germany
. 
A: When they attacked the 
Germany
, and then  Œ and th en they occupied the Polish 
territory, all the people from the underg r
ound forces, all the politicians, whoever 
they could put their hands on,
 were deported again, so 
that that was in 19 Œ you 
know, ™43, ™44, ™45, and later. And only 
after the Œ the final 
Œ you know, when Œ 
when  Œ when 
Stalin
 died, and ch anges started to 
occu r, they could manage to 
release those people. 
Q: Tell us a little bit about your own lif
e, did you get marri
ed? Did you have 
children? 

A: Yes, when Œ when I came back from th
e army, we started, 
you know, going back 
into the Polish neigh
borhoods and things, and I went to
 a Œ to a Ch ristmas party of 
the Polish scouting orani Œ organization. An d 
I run into  a very beau tiful woman, and 
so we start going togeth er, and tu rns out th
at she Œ she lived not
 too far away from 
where I was, and so it was Œ it was beginn
ing of 1957 actually. And it took her two 
years to decide that yes, she wants to ma
rry me. Oh, look at th
e faces she™s making. 
So we Œ we were married in 
July of 1959, an d in 1961 we moved to th is place here 
in chi Œ in 
Arlington Heights
. And we™re probably one of the very  few Poles that

132
live here, because there™s still Œ 
Polonia
 was still located  in th
e Œ in the city of 
Chicago
. And th en my Œ my  daughter was born in 1966. 
Q: What™s her name? 
A: Her name is 
Beatta
(ph). 
Q: 
Beatta
(ph), mm-hm. 
A: And she attended school here in Œ in 
Arlington Heights
, Ca-Catholic school. 
And then  she wanted
 to go to Œ to 
Saint inga Œ Ignatius College Prep 
in 
down town, and I was kind of just wonderi
ng whether, you know, for her to travel 
all that, and then she managed to talk to 
one of the boys that was going to  school, 
and he Œ he talked to me
 one time and he says, Mr. 
Pawlikowski
, you are going to 
commit a grave mistake if you don™t let 
your daughter go. So , what could I do? 
Q: Of course. 

A: And Œ and sh e went to
 school and that Œ it™s a 
very good school. And she 
[indecipherable]
 she studied Latin, she studied 
Greek, and she met her husband. 
And so, you know, they  Œ and th ey 
were married, and now we are happy 

grandparents of a six year old, 
Kinga
(ph), 
Kinga
(ph) 
Alexandra
. 
Q: 
Kinga
(ph )  
Alexa ndra
. 
A: A tri-lingual little character. She speak
s Polish very  fluently, she speaks 
Lithuanian 
[indecipherable]
 and now she speaks people™s language. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

133
Q: Which Œ 
A: She speaks the language of the people th
at walk on the street, which is English. 
So, now we can con Œ we can
 conduct conversations in two languages, that is we 
and Œ and she, and an other 
two languages with the Lit
huanian grandparents. So, 
she™s quite a character. 

Q: Have you been  back  to 
Poland
? 
A: We went back to 
Poland
 first time in 1979. 
Q: With your mother? 

A: No, my mother went in 
1958. Her mother still lived 
at that time. And so she 
spent about three months in Œ in 
Poland
, and was Œ she still went by ship, 
[indecipherable]
 from Œ from 
Ca na da
. And Œ 
Q: Did you ever go back to 
Do rdinna
(ph)? 
A: To what? 

Q: To 
Do rdinna
(ph)? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, because it was Œ it was the 
Ukraine
 and it Œ and besides, you know, I Œ I felt 
kind of Œ I think I™ve been there once, 
and that™s enough. 
I don™t Œ because you 
never know what these people can do. An
d you know, there s
till are wonderful

places to visit in Œ in Œ in 
Russia
, and Œ but even now, I do
n™t think that I would be 
Œ there are so many other places. And I vis
ited that one, one time, and it™s enough. 
So Œ and I don™t Œ don™t expect to go there. 
Q: What about 
Lódz
? Did you go back to 
Lódz
? 
A: Oh yes, you know, ™79, 
and then I went back in 200
0. So I still have Œ I™ve Œ I 
have some cousins that live there and we™re
 in contact with one of the cousins, 
Wavia
(ph), who came to visit us then Œ in 
1976 sh e came to visit us here in 
United 
States
. And she was very happy, but she told 
us later that Œ she says, I don™t even 
understand, how do you cover these distance
s? I mean, we get up at six o™clock in 
the morning, you drive til six o™clock at ni
ght, and then we drive again six o™clock 
in the morning, and, you know, she says, 
it Œ it just Œ just Œ 
how do you do that? I 
said, well, you sit in the car, and drive,
 and Œ you know. But she was very happy 
because we took her west, and we see 
the Œ we saw the Grand Canyon, and you 
know, things like that, and Œ in
 fact, I talked to her last 
week and I said, what Œ you 
know, as soon as you Œ as you retire, don™t forget that we are going to visit 
Hawa ii
, 
because that she want Œ she wa
nted to go there. So I ho
pe we can Œ we can manage 
to do that. 
Q: So you still have li Œ a-as you have co
ntact with friends that you made during 
those years of transition in ira Œ 
Iran
 and 
Iraq
 and 
Beirut
, you also still have ties

with family Œ the family
 that you had left in 
Poland
 when you were such a young 
boy. 
A: Well, except that now it™s Œ 
it™s the grandchildren of the Œ 
Q: Œ chil Œ grandchildren Œ 

A: Œ of th e Œ of the family. 

Q: Œ yeah . 

A: And not what Œ you know, i-in fact, it
 was kind of interesting thing because Œ 
because all of a sudden I Œ I Œ I get the te
lephone call from my cousin in Œ in Œ in 

Baltimore
, and she says, you know, there™s this 
woman that Œ that wrote to me, and 
she says that she™s cousin of mine, you 
know, a-and a Œ and a Œ y-you know, but she 
was saying something th at I don™t understand, you know. Maybe you can get in 

touch with her. So I get in touch with he
r, and find out that she™s the granddau ghter 
of one of the 12 children of
 Œ of Œ you know, of my  
grandmother™s brood. And so 
we established a relationship with 
Œ with her. And we hope to visit 
Poland
 next 
year, and so  I hope that I™m going to be 
able to Œ to meet w
ith her, she lives in 
Warsaw
. And it will be interesting, because no 
vos Œ all of a sudden, after all these 
years, you Œ you find someone Œ 
Q: Find another relat Œ yeah . 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
136
A: Right, right. And, you know, it™s Œ you 
wish it was here that there was Œ so I 
could have larger family in here, but you ar
e thankful that at least th ey™re all over 
the place, you know, so they co
uld Œ you could Œ you could Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ keep  in touch with them somehow.
 And of course it™s
 different worlds, 

different generations, she™s mu ch younger 
than I am, you know, and Œ but Œ but she 
was Œ she sounded very friendly, very want
ing to  establish a contact. So, we hope 
that we can Œ can do it.  

Q: What would you want 
Kinga
, when she is old enough to
 understand, what would 
you want your granddaughter 
Kinga
 to understand about who 
you were as an eight 
year old boy wh en all of this happened, 
seven year old boy. 
What would you want 
her to Œ to understand about that e
xperience, and to take away from it? 
A: Well, I suppose just a human part of
 it, an d a Œ and Œ and a Œ and a positive 
human heart Œ part of it, that please do
n™t dwell on it. That it happened, and it™s 
gone, you live different life, and apprecia
te wh at you have, cause you never know 
what life brings you. And I don™t Œ I don™t 
think I would like to load her and burden 
her with such things as Œ as killing 200 lic
e in Œ in a day. You know, it™s Œ it™s just 
inconceivable. And why Œ why pester the 
Œ the mind of a young 
person with  Œ with 
something like that? It Œ it™s Œ 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

137
Q: But what does it tell her 
about you as a person, as 
her grandfather? How does Œ 
you know, there™s Œ there™s some thing thro
ugh your life experience 
that can tell her 
something about you, and what 
would you want her to know? 
A: About the world. 
Q: Okay . 

A: That there is a greater world that one 
should visit. About the people, that you 
should not be locked  
up, that you should be
 open fo r other people.
 And that Œ and if 
you are open for other people, even  if the 
Œ if there are people that are against you, 

you can brush them aside b
ecause there are other people that will be friendly 
towards you. I think that™s 
important to know, because 
I experienced it, you know, 
the Œ the Œ the Cossacks, the 
Uzbeks
, the Iran ians, the Lebanese, the British, you 

know. The-These Œ these are experiences, b
ecause all th-thi Œ all this expands your 
brain, and makes Œ makes the world smaller,
 and larger at the same time, and makes 
you appreciate different cultures without ha
ving to  reme mb er the bad things. And I 
think that™s very important that Œ that yo
u should not carry some
thing that happened 
200 or 500 years ago, and yo
u still Œ you Œ you still kind 
of have some hatred tow-
towards the new generation that doesn™t kn
ow anything about it. And I Œ I think it™s 
important, because if you don™t practice th
at, we™ll always be at war. And I think 

that™s important.

yourself, whatever Œ whatever pain that 
you might have felt, it™s gone. 
A: It™s gone. No, it Œ you kn
ow, of course you remember. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You rememb er the Œ the Œ that you were
 just kicked out of your own country. 

But I don™t want to dw-dwell on it. I Œ I Œ 
I want it to be as an experience, but not 
something th at I experience every day. I th
ink that™s very nega
tive, and Œ and Œ and 
I think it™s Œ that poisons y
our Œ your whole lif
e, you know, your whole outlook at 
life, you know. And you know, i-it™s Œ it™s Œ 
it™s not constructive, because you can 
live with Œ with the 
[indecipherable]
 you can live with Œ you
 know, I mean, like I 
told you about this story about these guys th
at were Œ for hundreds of years they are 
looking for someone that™s Œ that™s going 
to play the anthem 
for them, to Œ to 
liberate them, you know. This 
is the positive experience, 
and I think these are more 
important than the other ones, if 
you have surv ived  them, of course. 
Q: If you have survived them. 

A: If you haven™t, then Œ 
then you have a problem.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: But Œ but I think Œ you kn
ow, I don™t Œ I don™t hold it anything against, say, the 
Russians. Because they suffere
d more than I. I suffered fo r two years, they suffered

for the Œ all their lives. And 
Œ and you know, this Œ this 
Œ even during the tsars, 
there was different kind of situation, but 
th-they were people th-ther Œ that were 
down trodden, and th en  they liberated them
selves in the name of the communism Œ 
and they  were downtro dden  again. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so, you know, 
and you Œ but you also
 have to remember Œ remember I told 
you about the story about the German o
fficer, that you Œ sometimes you really 
wonder, how can it be that people can be so
 cruel? A-And this Œ can I repeat this 
story? 

Q: Yes, of course you can. 
A: And Œ and Œ and the 
story is, I was reading Œ I read in
 a newspape Œ in Œ in a Œ in 
a ga Œ in a book that Œ as Œ as Œ as yo
u know, there were concentration camp s that 
were started on the Polish territory by th
e Germans. And most of them were to 

liquidate people that were undesirables, wh
ich was Po les, and the Jews, and there 
was Œ there was a story about this trans
port that was being taken in one of the 
camps, and the people were led into the 
camp, and there was a Œ a Jewish mother, 
and four or five year old little boy. And they
 were walking in  and Œ and at the gate 
stands the Œ the Gestapo officer, dressed up 
in beau tiful unifo rm, 
with the ha Œ with 
the hat and Œ and the long b
oots, and Œ and Œ and the 
[indecipherable]
 you know,

that he was kind of hitting 
his Œ his leg with it. And he was Œ for the boy it was Œ it 
was a marv elous, wonderful figure. So the 
boy just pulls away
 from his Œ from his 
mo ther™s hand and ru ns to the officer and 
offers him the only thing th at he has in 
life, an apple. And the officer smiles at 
the ch ild, takes the a
pple, bends over, grabs 
him by the hands and Œ and kills him on th
e spot. How do you e
xplain that? How do 
you explain the fact that pole Œ no, hu
n Œ th ousands of Polish officers were 
murdered by 
NKVD
, by killing them with a bullet in 
his Œ in the back of their head? 
You know, it was just a very simple thing, right. Next, next. Then you go home, you 
have supper. You put your ch
ild on Œ on your lap, tell hi
m the story. And next day 
you go and do th e same thing. Impossible to
 believe that human beings are capable 
of that. Am I to Œ to Œ to remember all 
these things all the time, and accuse all the 
people of the Œ being possible to do th
at? No, it Œ it was circumstan ces. But 
circumstan ces like that, there are hundreds 
of them, you know, th at people can be 
capable of such barb
arity, and it Œ in a civilized natio
n. You know, to Œ to kill six 
million Jews? To have special concentra
tion camps that you ju st do nothing but 
daily, you know, take th
em to the bathroom Œ 
Q: Death rooms. 
A: Œ to Œ to the Œ to ta Œ basically take 
the shower, and instead of water coming out, 
a gas comes out of the shower things, a
nd you Œ and you kill 
them by the hundred.

You know, and all in the name of an idea th
at Œ that these are bad people, and that 
you have to get rid of them b
ecause Œ because you are looking for 
lebensraum
, 
which is the space, you know, living space,
 the Germans were doing it. They were 
going to  liquidate the Po les, and they were
 going to  liquidate the Russians, because 
they were going to take over all this terri
tory and fo rm a thousand year old Reich, 
you know. 
Q: The idea. 
A: That was the idea. And Œ and many of th
em went for it. And then when I was in 
Germany
 in Œ in Œ in 1955 or 
™56, it was all gone. They 
were all back to normal 
people, you know, and you Œ 
nobod Œ nobody knew. They 
just didn™t know th at 
something like that was happening. Wh ich is
, of course, something else. But Œ but Œ 
Q: Well, from what you say, it sounds lik
e we™re veering between the need to  go 
forward, and the need to re
member, but not to dwell on 
what you remember. Is that 
right? 

A: Yes, you Œ you Œ 
you have to  reme mb er. And that
™s why I think the Holocaust 
Museum d-does a wo nderful thing, and I™m 
so grateful that they extended their 

willingness to come to places
 like Œ like my home. Yes, 
you must, but not that you 
have to, you must remember that. And you mu
st teach that to the 
next generation, so 
they don™t repeat that kind of
 mistake. And I think, if we learned any lessons, then

maybe the sacrifices will bear
 fruit. But the Œ th
e only thing we ha
ve to do is to 
make sure that somehow we convey it to
 other generations, you know, and they  
remember that human beings are capable of
 these unbelievable atrocities, all in  the 
name of some idiotic idea, or Œ or in the name of 
Bach kastani
(ph), who Œ who 
killed his own Œ he had the pr
oblems in the begi
nning of Œ of the Œ 
of the war when 
he waged war against 
Germany
, because before, in th
e 30s, he killed all the 
officers™ staff. 
Q: You™re talking about 
Stalin
, yeah. 
A: Yes, you know. And so Œ so , you know
, because you don™t trust anyone, even 
the people that were with you all this time,
 helping you to  get to
 the top of the pile, 
and then you kill them be
cause you mistrust them. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And Œ and I think this is th
e si Œ this is the something 
that Œ that will Œ we should 
be able to convey  to other generations, 
that you know, please don™t become one of 
those. Be a human being. 
Be a loving human being and 
Œ and don™t persecute your 
brothers. 

Q: Well, thank you. Thank you for sharing 
your story with us 
today. Thank you for 
the energy and the time and the atten
tion, and we™re very, very grateful.

st
, 2015. 
Okay, so Mr. 
Pawlikowski
, now I want to talk to
 you a little bit ab out the 
documents here that you have on your la
p. Have you ev er seen anything like this 
before? 

A: No, I haven™t. Because I d Œ apparen
tly these were filled
 out by my  mo ther 
somewhere. I don™t rem Œ I don™t see the 
date. But it says that it™s a displaced 
person registration record, wh ich Œ wh ich 
shows the registration numb er, and my  
mother™s name, place of birth, religion, th
e father™s name, mother™s name and last 
place of residency in 
Poland
. And okay, thank you. 
Q: And there™s one for her and I believe one for you as well. 
A: There™s one fo r me, which is Œ which is 
I™m really grateful for that, but this a Œ 
cause I didn™t even know that Œ 
that something like that exists.

Q: The third page is part of
 the listing in the list on the 
[indeciphera ble]
 boat that 
you took to the 
United States
. Your names are down th ere.
 
A: Right, my  names are Œ are here, and my
 mo ther™s birthdate and place of birth, 
and Œ international ref Œ 
refugee organization travel
 documents are issued in
 Beirut
. 
So this is the Œ the register of the Œ on th
e ship  that Œ that Œ which we took to  Œ to 
the 
United States
, which is really something. Yo
u know, they just simp ly didn™t 
share these documents with 
us, you know. Maybe they wo
uld have if we asked for 
it, but Œ and Œ and th ese are also some registration cards. 
Q: For you and fo r her? 

A: Date was 4-9-1950. So this wa
s when we apparently are leaving 
Leba no n
 to  go  
to 
England
. Yes, last  occasion 
Beirut
,
 Lebanon
, and destination 
Eng l and
, on 
SS 
Oxfo rdshire
.  
Q: You know, it™s interesting that I fou 
Œ I got those documents after I got the 
questionnaire that you filled 
out. And as I was looking th rough th em I said, this 
confirms everything that you told  me 
in the questionnaire, everything th at you 

wrote in the que Œ now, one w
ouldn™t doubt it, it™s simply Œ 
A: You do have doc
umentation of it. 
Q: We do have documentation. 

A: Right. 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
145
Q: Yeah. So what does it say? Does it 
Œ does it have a meaning fo r you wh en  you 
see something like th is, 60 Œ 
70 years after the event? 
A: Well, it™s just like what 
you said. It Œ it really shows the documentation that I did 
go th rough those things. It™s not only the 
Stalin™s 
picture that I have to show you, 
but Œ but there is actually documenta
tion. Of course, we
 don™t have any 
documentation from the 
Soviet Union
, but Œ but this is Œ is
 a Œ a wonderful thing, 
and this Œ this is application for assistan
ce, whatever that was. And it was 1947, so 
we were in 
Leba no n 
at that time. And this must be 
the Œ when international refu Œ 
refugee organization had take
n over, and my mother had 
to fill this out. So Œ and 
this also is a recommendation from 
England
, from the Polish hostel in 
Loth ian
(ph)
 
Park
, 
Pendred
(ph) 
Cumberland
, that my mother has le
ft the camp  to go to a 
hostel in 
Liverpool
, and was due to sail for 
USA
 on the following da
y. So this is 
confirmation that we did tr
avel on Her Majesty™s Œ becau
se Her Majesty paid for 
the trip. 
Q: Ah, to  the 
United States
? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: What would you say to other people?
 Would you say that it is worth them 
making an effort to find out th Œ 
you know, about su
ch  do cu men t s?

A: Oh yes, I would say this Œ this is 
fantastic, and I Œ you know, maybe it is my  
fault, maybe I could have inquired my self, but Œ 
Q: But you may never have 
known of its existence. 
A: But 
[indecipherable]
 of the existence of somethin
g like that, you know. I mean, 
something that says that she left 
in feb Œ second February for the 
Danfield Lane 

Hostel 
in 
Liverpool
, and th en Œ you know, and Œ an
d this is the international 
refugee organization wh ich Œ I Œ I Œ I have to  read it, but Œ 
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ but it™s a statement of my mother, th
at she had to sign, that she waives and 
surrenders any rights and claims of demands of any blah-blah-blah , whatever. 
Q: Some official language there. 
A: Some official language that I would be 
glad to Œ to read, 
but you know, we are 
really grateful to Œ to Œ to
 the fact that such an orga
nization was formed, and helped 
not thousands, but millions of people to go 
back and to start life again, in a normal 
life. Not the place where you see somebody 
hitting a child™s head on the Œ on the 
pavement, but normal life, a
nd you can appreciate that 
and Œ and you know, that™s 
why I want Œ when I came to the 
United States
, I tried to every Œ you know, to Œ to 
do ev erything I can not to go ag ainst the la
w. I was never arrested. I did not use 
drugs, because life was too dear to me. A
nd I Œ I think that™s important to know, 

 
Interview with Witold Pawlikowski

147
that you just live once, and you live for a ve
ry short period of time, and it is mu ch 
simpler to live a simple life, a normal li
fe, where you have family, where you have 
Œ you go to church, where 
you worship, wh ere you rememb er that it Œ it was not 
your doing that you were saved, it was some
thing else. And th en I think it™s Œ that™s 
very important how, even though you ha
ve no proof, cause yo
u Œ cause you been 
just, you know, right place in the 
right time, but something else. 
Q: I understand. 
A: And I Œ and I think it™s im-important to
 Œ to know and to ack
nowledge it, and to 
thank God for Œ for this gift of life. 
And now, being grandfather, you know, and 
having a ni Œ a young lady that, you kno
w Œ wh ere™s Œ where™s my  painting? 
Where™s my  painting, grandchild™s pa-p
ainting? Because you know, the Œ the 
grandparents week this week. 
An d my  Œ show me Œ show yours, too. And Œ and we 
Œ w-we Œ we went to visit our daughter ove
r the weekend, and sh
e presented us the 
roses for the grandpa over th
ere, and grandma got her em
broidery  of her pain ting, 
and grandpa got Œ got the picture. 
Q: Let™s see. Oh, this is Œ 

A: This is Œ this is the embroidery.

A: That™s her Œ that™s her painting, but 
embroidery , of course, is mother™s. But 
nevertheless, Grandma got that. And th is is 
Jaja

you know, you have to
 reme mb er that your blessing continues. 
Q: Thank you. Than
k you very mu ch. 
A: Of course Œ of course 
[indecipherable]
 is misspelled, but it™s okay.  
Q: That™s part of the charm. 
A: Right, that™s part of the charm, of course. And grandma 
[indecipherable]
  
A2: But this one is important. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But you know, that™s Œ th
at™s important. The grandpa. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And apparently, this is the gr
andpa with the beard, of course. 
Q: Green beard. Well, thank you grandpa. 

A: You™re welcome.
