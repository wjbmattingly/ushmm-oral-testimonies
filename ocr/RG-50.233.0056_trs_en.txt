Abstract 
This is an oral history of tw
ins, Rene Slotkin (born Rene Gu
ttma n [Gut ma n]) and Irene Hizme 
(born Renatta [Renate] Guttman), recorded on April 12, 1992 in Oceanside , New York.  
The twins describe their stories and me mories, 
starting from t heir birth on December 21, 1937 in 
Teplice-Sanov, Czech Republic, and continui ng 
through their early lives in Prague, their 
experiences in the camps, and their eventual i
mmigration to the United States.  Their father, 
Herbert Guttman, was arrested as a political prisoner in December of 1941 and eventually he was 

taken to Auchwitz, where he died.  In 1943, Rene
, Irene, and their mother Ita were deported to 

the Theresienstadt concentration camp and then 
later sent to Auschwitz, where the family was 
separated and where their mother perished. 
Although the siblings were kept completely sepa
rate while at Auschwitz, both children became 
subjects in Joseph Mengele™s me dical experime
nts on twins.  Upon liberation, they did not 
reunite for several years, during 
which time they were sent to 
various homes and orphanages.  
Thanks in pa rt to an article in 
Life Magazine
 that contained a profile 
of Ms. Hizme, Irene was 
brought to America by Operation Rescue Children and adopted by an American couple, the 
Slotkins.  When the Slotkins disc
overed that Irene had a brother, they began searching for Rene, 
and eventually found him living in Czechoslovakia. 
 The family adopted Rene as well, br inging 
him to the United States in 1950.

Interview with Irene Hi zm e and Rene Slotkin 
April 12, 1992 
Oceanside, Ne w York 
R: My name  is Rene Slotkin. This is now Ap
ril, 1992. I was born Rene Guttman [Gut ma n] in 
1937 in Tepice-Sanov (Teplitz Schoenau) which 
is in Czechoslovaki
a (Czech Republic). 
What is your specific birth date? 
R: Decembe r 21, 1937. And I am not sure how long we
 actually lived Œ or how long I stayed in 
Tepice-Sanov, but my first recoll
ection is living in Prague. Um– Irene, you have something? 
I: Oh sure. My name  is Irene Hizme  and I was 
Renatta (Renate) Guttma n, I was born the same  
day and I am a half an hour older than Re
ne. Um–I don™t reme mber Teplice-Sanov but I do 
reme mber Prague and we  lived upstairs in an
 apartment. We had a 
terraceŠ it overlooked a 
yard, um–I  don™t think it was a very
 big apartme nt. I kind of reme mb
er a lot of things being in 
one room. Um– our crib Œ we slept in a crib Œ 
and it was in the room where our parents™ bed 
was as well. And some place down always was a tabl
e. That™s kind of all I reme mber. There was 
a long flight of stairs
 to get upstairs.  
R: Yeah, the staircase Œ I reme mber that too. ‚C
ause I reme mber falling on the stairs once and 
cutting my c hin and having a burning sensation 
when I was treated for it. And, lo and behold, 
years after, after the war when I 
first reme mbered this, I looked and 
there is a little scar there.  
You recently took a trip where you recall 
a certain streetcar or  a trol ley?  
R: Well, after the war, I return
ed to Prague becauseŠ because we had some  friends who had 
some  documents and pictures of us when were 
much younger, before the war with our parents. I 
do reme mbe r  then seeing a trolley car with th
e number 22. I didn™t know what was 22 at the time 
but the image is 2-2. We  followed the routes of 
the tram at that time Œ number 22 Œ and I was 
able to locate this particular apartment building a
nd it turned out to be the right one, so that was a 
bit exciting. But even mo re exciting was being able 
to, at the time, to get Œ this must have been 
in 1948 Œ just before I started my trek to the Unite
d States, to be able to
 get actual pictures of 
myself and Irene and my parents together.  It sort 
of  really gave me  some  roots for the first time  
everŠ some thing tangible to be able to look at
 and know that I had a 
beginning and parents like 
everyone else.  
I: I have very sporadic me mories of our chil
dhood, but I do reme mber that
 we were beautifully 
clothed. We  had beautiful clothing Œ ma tc
hing outfits. You know there was alwaysŠ I 
reme mber, particularly, we had these um– you 
knowŠ not these, with bells on them so our 
mom could hold us with like a leash. Not a leas
h, but you know what I™mtalking aboutŠ I don™t 
know how you call that
Š how do you call that? 

4
A harnessŠ 
I: A harness. And they had thes
e little bells on them. I reme mber 
that  very clearly. I reme mber 
also very often going to a park which must have 
been near our home, with
 our parents. And most 
vividly, I reme mber, one time there 
was a huge storm and we  went to the park afterwards and all 
these trees had fallen down and we were cl
imbi ng Œ you know like kids do Œ on them, walking 
along the treesŠ it was r
eally a lot of fun.  
R: The pictures are of us, our pa
rents and ourselves in the park. 
I: We  even have pictures in the park. And I reme
mber Œ this is just some thing that  came  to my 
head Œ I remember candy that we used to get. Like a ma r malade, um– it™s like the Pa ssover 
candy that they used to ma ke. You know those je
lly– jelly kind of candies
. I reme mber that for 
some  strange reason. 
Do you remember what they tasted like? 
I: Yeah, kind of orangey. That 
was weird, I just– we also had, 
we had a certain number of toys. 
And we used to play upstairs 
in the apartment, the one specif
ically I remember, we had punches 
(ph 058) like conductors on a train and we would pl
ay train a lot and we would punch the tickets. 

And I also reme mber having a doll, which Rene
 very nicely threw down from the balcony and 
smashed to smithereens. Yes. 
Was that one of those celluloid dolls fr om the time or– 
I: Yeah– 

R: It was big. 
I: Yeah, a big doll. 
R: From that period, what I reme mbe r  is being 
in the yard of this bu
ilding and stepping on a 
beeŠ 
I: Yeah, he was bittenŠ 
R: And I was bitten by a bee and even now, wh
e n I think about it, my foot starts itching. 
I: Yeah, right on the bottom 
of your foot, I reme mber th
at so clearly, it™s funny.  
Did they take you to a hospital or wa s it ju
st taken care of at home , do you reme mbe r? 
R: I think it was just taken care of the 
way you would take care of a bite today. 

5
I: And the other thing I reme mber so clearly, is 
when mo m us ed to put us to bed, we played kind 
of a ga me . She would put our hands in a certain 
order and we would see if we could wake up in 
the same  position. Do you reme mbe r  that? 
R: No. 
I: I reme mb er that . 
So you shared a crib? 

I: Yes, we shared a crib. You were on the– right. 
What have you learned now in terms of what 
your father did, in terms of his occupation? 
R: My father was in the export/import business a
nd I think this somehow le
d to his accusation of 
being a spyŠ because I imagine that he had deal
ings with foreign countries. He was originally 
from Ger ma ny, the whole fa mily is from Ger many 
so this is what he was accused of, and I think 
on the basis of that he was jailed and sent
 to the camps. My mother I don™t know.  
I: Our mo m,  she also worked, she was very
 good in ma th, so I think she had some thing 
equivalent to possibly an accounting job, which of 
course, once laws that you couldn™t hire Jews 
came about, you know she was laid off. But she did have a good job.  
Do you know if you were a fairly well-off 
fa mily or typical mi ddle class or–? 
R: I can only judge by the clothing that we wore
 from the photographs we  have, we can show 
you. We  seem very well dre
ssed and our parents also. 
I: I think–by that time, our parent s had fled fr
om  Dresden to Czechoslovakia where we were 
born, but I think our aunts from Dr
esden kept sending us clothes. 
It was our aunt that sent us 
clothes. Because our parents coul d not buy anythi
ng. Because by then our father was out of work 
and so was our mo m. 

R: In other words, after we 
left GermanyŠ when they left 
Germany, that was the whole down– 
I: Yeah, they no longer had any source of 
support and it was our
 aunt that sent– 
When did they leave Germany? 

I: We ll we were born in ™37 so
 it must have been around then. 

I see. 

I: There are a series of
 letters between their father and th
e aunt in GermanyŠ about ten letters 
that we have, describing the 
children™s behavior and how– 

6
R: Yeah, that is terrific to have. 
I: Memories for the future– they 
are wonderful. They™re in German. 
You don™t know specifically what your
 father imported and exported? 

R: No. 
But he was arrested in Czechoslovakia, I see. 
Do you have any recollections of his being taken 
or– 
I: I do. I definitely do, again, 
not clearly but, one night, ther
e was a knock on the door, a very 
loud knockŠ and there were soldiers who had come
 and they came to take our father away. I 
reme mber our mo m was  crying. We  didn™t know wh
at happened. It was late at night and we 
never saw him again afte
r Œ at least I don™t– 
R: I just remember what she sai
d. It was a disturbing event, it 
did happen but that™s about it.  
About how old were you at the time? 

R: I would say four. 
And are you the only children of your pa
rents. No brothers or sisters? 
(Silence on the tape for a few seconds) 
Any other memories that you 
would like to talk about? 
I: Something in the letter s, maybe? I can™t recall th
e letters.  I do reme mb er at some  point that we 
used to stand on line to get 
foodŠ I sort of reme mber that. Um– the people stood on line. 
Do you know if your fa mily was religious? 

I: I have no recollection. 
R: None. 
Did relatives ever come  to visit you 
in Czechoslovakia, that you recall? 
R: No 
I: I do reme mber once though, that in the summe r
, it must have been summerti me , I don™t know 
when, but we went some place where there was wa te
r, like a beach. That™s 
all I can reme mber.  
R: It would have to be a lake. 

I: Maybe a lake, I don™t know
 but I reme mber being– 

7
R: I don™t reme mber it. See what thirty
 mi nutes ma kes?  A big difference.  
One of those me mories–(everyone laughs). We ll,
 you have good recollections of being injured 
(to Rene). What do you recall about the changes 
in Prague or changes in your life once the 
Germans oc cupied?  Or what is th
e first significant me mory you ha
ve of a real change in your 
lifestyle?  
I: My first significant me mory is waiting to get 
on this train to go some place. It was a nice train 
though, you know it was like a sleeper 
or some thing, with windows.  
R: I think that was Theresiens
tadt that we were going to. 
I reme mber too, chronologically 
speaking, that is the next me mory
 after. Because the previous memories, it wasn™t a good life– a 
good existence, I don™t think.  

I: Umm, it was, I think I– as a chil
d, I sensed some thing was not right but– 
R: That™s right, that™s what I™m saying. 
I: Our mother was rather  sad. 
R: ‚Cause I don™t reme mber my father, obviously my
 motherŠ she would have to have been sad. 
I: I reme mb er a certai n sadness, 
but the next thing, as
 I said, was really 
this train ride to 
someplace else to live. 
R: That was Theresienstadt. 
I: That was Theresienstadt. 
Do you remember taking anythi
ng with you, in particular?   
I: We ll, we did have some  stuff but– I– this 
is– I– the only thing I 
recall is that I had a 
locket. I had a locket that I– a heart, and I re
member having that for a long time even when I 
arrived in Auschwitz and I was very brazen. We
 would stand on line for the showers and we 
would have to strip naked and I had enough presen
ce of mi nd to know that I had to take this 
thing off and I would hold on to it. I don™t know how
 I did it, but I did it.
 I lost the locket 
however, some where.  
What did the locket  look like? 
I: It was a heart shaped locket. It had 
pictures inside of 
itŠ I don™t recall.  
This was a gift from your mother? 

I: It must have been, probably. 

 
You don™t recall taking a t
oy with you or umm–? 
R: The only thing I remember was my mother™s 
shoulder and the texture of the dress that she 
wore.  

8
On that day, or–? 
R: Not on that day, but from Theresienstadt. Th
at™s one of the things Œ since you asked us 
some thing tangible Œ this is what I do reme
mber. And I think there was a pictur e takenŠ 
I: Picture taken of usŠ 

R: Picture was taken of us at that point in time  andŠ 

I: We  have the picture. 
R: Yeah, we got the picture and you know, it conf
irms  this shoulder that I was leaning on. We  
have it right here. And, but I don™
t reme mber taking anything with
 me , like a personal toy or 
anything like that. No, I don™t. 
So you reme mber how her dress felt? 
R: Yeah, it was coarse– 
I: But I do reme mber that our mo m did carry a 
bag with something. That I reme mber but I don™t 
know what was in it really.  

Do you remember anything about the 
train journey itself, and getti
ng to the train station outside 
Theresienstadt? 
I: Actually, the train ride was 
kind of– I don™t know, I enjoyed it. I think it was ma ybe our first 
train ride. It was a pretty nice trai
n ride. It wasn™t bad, as I recall,
 that trip to Theresienstadt.  
R: I have a blank on that. 
You do?  You don™t reme mber the ma rch to Theres
ienstadt?  What are your first me mories of 
Theresienstadt? 
I: Unfortunately, I think I have very mi ni ma
l me mories of Theresienstadt. Again, only, I 
reme mber cobblestone roads, pavements, brick bu
ildings, I always see these bridges over water, 
I don™t know if it™s from there, I do
n™t know, but that come s to mi nd.  
Were you staying with your mother there?  We re you still with her? 
R: Yes, yes. I reme mber you being sick ther
e (to Irene). 
I: It™s possible, I was sick a lot– 

R: Over there, I do reme mber you being ill. 
Was she taken away to the hospital in the camp or– 
R: To some  infirmary but she didn™t stay overn
ight or anything. She would just go there and 
come  back. 

I: And in Theresienstadt, I also
 reme mber standing on line and I 
reme mb er the cart s with dead 
bodies. 

9
R: Yeah and on the cobblestone too. 
I: They just– yeah. 
R: Hard pushing, the wheels would get stuck betw
een these rocks and everything would come  to 
a halt and they would have to get everybody on the si
de to get this thing st arted again, rolling and 
they lost a few bodies every once in a while, that rolled off.  
I: Umm– 

Do you recall what your day to day life was 
like there?  Did you– there was an underground 
school. Do you recall ever getting taught– 
I: I can™t recall. I think we  were too young for 
the school. I am not sure we attended. But I don™t 
know.  
R: I don™t recall. 
I: I don™t recall it at all. Well recently, there was a 
film made about Theresienstadt and in the film 
footage, which we saw in the Village just this
 year, there was a kindergarten, and on the bottom 
steps I spotted Rene in the film, so he was pa
rt of the kindergarten group, whether they were 
active or not. It was part of the 
Nazi propaganda film footage.  
Oh, I see.  

I: I don™t recall. 
R: I don™t recall either
. It is possible. 
I: It is possible. And I don™t 
know if you recall this, I don™t know
 if it™s an ____ (??  ph 14) time 
for me , but at one point, do you reme mber standing 
in a field, just for hours and hours on end, I 
don™t know for what. No? It is just  something that is
 kind of flitting in and out of my head lately, 
but I can™t exactly recall– 
R: I reme mb er some thing, it was fields, it was dar
k, was dark and I think we were waiting for the 
train to Auschwitz.  
I: No that™s a different– 
R: That™s a different– ‚Cause I reme mber 
taking quite a walk towards that train. 
I: Oh yeah, I reme mber that too, but that, no, this 
was just a lot of people 
were there and we were 
just kind of standing around waiting.  

Well that did happen. There was an occurrence li
ke that where ma ny people were taken out of 
the camp and held in a field, in a fo
rest outside of Theresienstadt.  
I: Really? 
Yeah, so this is what I have read and 
what I have heard fr
om other survivors. 
R: And what was the purpose of that?  

10
Well actually, last night Inge Auer
bacher talked about that too, for what she reme mbered, she 
was an older child, that it looked as though th
ey ha d plans to kill everybody. You know, she put 
it, ﬁBabi Yar style,ﬂ you know, s
hoot people into ma ss graves, butit didn™t ma terialize for some  
reason Œ luckily Œ and everyone went back to th
e camp, back to Theresienstadt, so that mi ght 
have beenŠ it mi ght be that you recall.  
I: Hmm. We ll, on occasion, that is how they handl
ed epidemics. There was some  kind of disease 
and they couldn™t handle it, well that
 would be their me dical solution.  
And actually, before the film, they did depor
t ma ny people also, before they filmed the 
propaganda movie. Because they knew that it
 was too crowded. Do you reme mber if your 
mother was with you all day or did she leave you 
during the days as if to go to some  kind of 
labor detail? 
R: I don™t think that she was with
 us all day but I – I do reme mber
 running wild in the place. I 
do. And I™m throwing things into windows and 
from windows down, and I™m sure that happened 
while I was unsupervised.  
Do you remember if you were with other kids? 
R: Yeah, yes. Wa r game s, I guess you would call them. 

I: Don™t you reme mber drawing, some inklingof me mory, I think you once me ntioned to me . I 
don™t know, it doesn™t come  to me  
at this mo me nt. The head of 
the children™s school wa s in your 
transpor t fr om Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and hi
s name  I forgot but it will come  to me in a 
mi nute. Very influential person, because he ke
pt such a wonderful 
spirit among the children 
there and um– I think that when I me ntione
d it to you once, you did reme mber drawing.  
Do you remember any thoughts you had about these wagons with dead bodies, I me an, did you 

think it was interesting as a chil
d, do you recall any t
hought you had then? 
I: My thoughts were that 
I didn™t understand it, didn™t 
understand what it was but I– 
R: I don™t think that it made the emotional impact 
that it would to some body a lot older. ‚Cause it 
was just some thing– we were learning new things 
and I think it was just a
nother thing for us to 
learn.  
I: It was life, whatever it was, that
 is what happened to some  people.  
Do you have any me mory of wearing a star? 
 

I: I don™t. 
R: I do. 
What do you recall about that? 

R: H mm. 
Do you recall getting it, or do 
you just recall wearing it– 

11
R: I just had it. I don™t know where eve
n. I don™t know– where woul
d that have been. 
Probably in Prague. 
R: In Prague, yeah, yeah. Very small, but it wa
s there and ﬁJuden.ﬂ I 
reme mber people pointing 
to us because of it but uh– it™s the first time I ever– 
I: Mentioning Prague, I just reme mb ered some thing. And probably Œ ma ybe this didn™t even 
happen Œ because Prague was never bombed was it
? I reme mber sirens, I reme mber sirens and I 
reme mber that we would go downstairsŠ must ha
ve been Prague because where else  would I 
have gone downstairs? 
Was this a large building that you live
d in?  Many apartments or do you know–? 
R: Not terribly, I would say 
like six, seven stories. Right? 
I: Yeah, something like that. 
R: Going down– 
I: Yes, yes. And all the othe
r people in the building went 
down tooŠ there were other people 
there too. Yeah. Wa s there food dow
n there or any provisions?   
R: Would this fit? 
Yeah, it could. I don™t know off hand but it mi ght.  
R: It is very vagueŠ very mi sty.  

In your home, did you speak German?  Do you reme mber? 
I: I think we spoke German. Because I seem to
 understand Yiddish after the war and I couldn™t 
figure out how, soŠ it had to be.  
An early implantŠ 

I: An early implant from some place. See, the grownups thought that I didn™t understand what 
they were saying but I understood.  
R: Seemingly, we understood but I don™t reme
mber what language, but when anybody spoke, 
especially the Germans there, I 
knew exactly what they were sa
ying. So that would have to be. 
But I am sure that since we grew up in Czechosl
ovakia, that we must ha ve learned that tooŠ the 
fi rst  few years.  
I: But see– 
R: Or you don™t think that we were out all that much? 
I: No, I don™t think that we were out and I thi
nk that you learned Czech af
ter the war, because I 
have no recollection of Czech
 at all, German yes. 
R: I don™t reme mber the language, 
I just reme mb er understanding.  

12
Do you remember, do you have any me mories of a
ny of the S.S. guards or the soldiers?  What 
they looked like or um– treatment of
 other people or of yourself?   
I: Well the fi rst recollection that  I have of the 
S.S. Œ I guess Œ or the so
ldiers or whatever, was 
when we took this very long walk in Theresienstadt
 to the train that was to
 take us to Auschwitz. 
R: There were dogs there– 
I: And they had dogs there. It was a long column
 of people who were ma rc
hing, it was at night, 
there was snow on the ground and it was very, bitte
rly cold. And if people didn™t walk quickly 
enough, they would shoot them. They would just 
shoot the people. There were shots that rang 
out and I just saw bodies kind of falling. I don™t 
know Œ again Œ I don™t 
think that I really 
understood that they were dead or that they 
weren™t going to get up again and there were dogs 
and I reme mber that I was kind of tired and I 
didn™t want to go on 
this tripŠ my mo m– 
R: Our mother held us by our hands, pulling us,  

I: Pulling us– 

R: I reme mb er that.  
You were being roused awake or– 
I: Well, it was at ni ght– 

R: It was at night, but 
it started– at  the evening, it was prob
ably– it wasn™t an arousal in the 
mi ddle of the night, it was something 
that was ongoing in the evening– 
I: And it seemed like a very long walk, but that  might have been that we we re so little– 

Little legsŠ 

I: Little legs, it seems that the transport card, 
which was posted on the wall in Theresienstadt Œ 
and that is when you knew your time had come  to
 go. We  recovered these transport tickets and 
they are in a museum in Israel, in a kibbutz Œ 
Givat Chaim Yi hud Œ they have a whole slew of 
things about Czech-all the Czech families that we
re in Theresienstadt  and that™s in fact, where 
Rene and I found an affidavit that indicated 
that our mother had died in Auschwitz.  
R: And our name s are thereŠ 

I: Our namesŠ 
R: With dates of birth are th
ere, everyt hing is there.  
I: And what transport numbers Œ 
the numbers that we had on the 
transport Œ to Theresienstadt 
and from Theresienstadt and to
 Auschwitz and the dates.  
R: Decembe r 15Š 

I: December 15 to Auschwitz– 
R: To AuschwitzŠ 1943. 

13
I: To Theresienstadt it was August. 
R: About a year-AugustŠ 
I: 1942. Or September 9, I am not 
sure, I always get confused.  
R: No it was August– 
I: Yeah, it was August. 
R: A little over a year – 
I: There was also another artist
 that wa s on that same  transpor
t Œ and he has drawn account after 
account of what happened that night Œ and you can 
see in his black and white drawings the pitch 
black of night and the entrance into Auschwitz Œ 
the spilling out of the prisoners from the cattle 
cars Œ and it™s a very clear image of what they
 actually went through.  Bernard– um– I forgot 
his name .  
This photograph of you two and your mother, 
where was this taken, do you reme mbe r?   
I: Theresienstadt 

R: Theresienstadt 
Was there–do you reme mber why it was taken, did 
there just happen to be a photographer in 
Theresienstadt? 
They were doing these things– 
I: Doing these things and I thi
nk they sent it out to family 
me mbers to say Œ ﬁ We™re fine.  
Everything is great.ﬂ  
Do you think that this wa s probably done early?  Do
 you recall that it happened shortly after you 
arrived in the camp?  

R: I couldn™t say. We  were there over a year
, empirically, knowing this
 now. I don™t recall. 
I: It is hard to tell. 
R: But looking at us, I would say that we looked pretty goodŠ soŠ 
I: So it mi ght have been early. 

R: Early. 

Do you have any me mory of the clothes that you were wearing? 
R: No, I remember what my mother was wearing Œ how it felt. 

14
I: But I remember– my  hair. 
R: I reme mb er your dress– that dress– colors. 
I: I reme mb er that  dress. 
R: Sort of reddish, purplish– 

I: Reddish, purplish  right. Yeah. And I reme mbe r Š 
R: Šand there was yellow lines, right?? 
I: Yes! Yes! 

So the squares are purplish? 
R: Yeah, basically a purplish background, they
 were like squares a
nd also like yellow. 
I: See that. 
R: But obviously this is the first tim
e ever that I am reme mbering this. 
I: But I remember that my mo m always
 made me a thing on top of my head– 
R: Yeah the longŠ 

I: I had long hair and she 
always had– yeah right. 

What was your mother™s name ?   
R: Ita. 
And so you recall walking to th
e transport to Auschwitz, and the dogs and the guards shooting 
people who were straggling I guess.  
Or beating them, or yelling and the dogs barking. 
Yeah, they just had to get the trains loaded. 
I: It was horrible. 

R: Yeah, it was our first real di
splay of real uh– force against 
the people Œ that I reme mber. 
I: It was horrible. 
And your mother was pulling you along?  Had you by the hand. 
R: Yeah. She had two of us, she couldn™
t carry much of anything else right? 

15
I: But she also did, she still had some
thing. A small parcel of some  sort. 
What do you recall about 
the transport itself? 
I: That was horribl e. 
R: That I reme mber. Uh– we were absolutely ja
mmed into this car, I can smell the stench of 
what went on in there. Everything went on in th
ere. And we were there for a very, very long 
time. People were tryi ng to faint and fall 
down, but they almo st couldn™t becauseŠ 
I: It was so crowded, you couldn™t turn around or
 anything. It seemed like an endless journey. 
Just an endless journey.  
You were all together in a car. 
I: Yeah, with lots and lots of other people.There was nothing to eat. I reme mber being very 
thirsty. I reme mber biting my hand. 
What did biting your hand do? 

I: I wanted to cry but I knew 
thatŠ I didn™t dare cry, I think 
R: That was really a strange environment, we 
really didn™t know what was going on. This was so 
unnatural.  

I: I didn™t understand 
what was happening. 
R: Heard the clickety click of the 
train rolling, just on and on and on.  

Do you remember anything about your mother on th
is transport?  Anything that she was doing or 
saying to you? 

R: She was up thereŠ I was down. 

I: Yeah, she was standing. 
R: She was holding us close, that is a
ll I reme mb er. There wasn™t any cont act. 
I: I kind of reme mber hanging on to her legs. 
R:  Yeah right. 

I: I reme mb er that I want ed to sit down. I want
ed to sit, but there was no space, you couldn™t turn 
around.  

Do you remember other children on the transport? 

16
R: No. 
Did your mo ther have any food with her?  Do 
you recall her passing any bread to you or potato 
or–?  
I: I would think that she must have
 had some thing but I don™t reme mber. 
So this journey took quite a while?  Se veral days? 
I: At least a day, I would think. We  arri
ved December 18, so 
it took three days.  
R: I think that ther e were 
people who died on that ride. 

I: Oh, there were. 

R: Because, when they opened the doors, th
ey were lying, there was no moveme nt down. 
You reme mber that? 

R: Yeah. The stench was unbelievable. That 
I can smell every once in a while, actually. 
ﬁHerausﬂŠ it was German again and the dogs an
d ﬁschnell,ﬂ ﬁmacht schnell.ﬂ  And again your 
mother had youŠ you were thrown out of the train? 
I: And mi raculously enough, we stayed with 
our mother. There was a whole Czech La ger, a 
special fami ly Lager for the Czech families 
that everybody stayed together-men, women and 
children. It was a specialŠ from Decembe
r to March, we stayed together.  
So, other twins have recounted them yelling 
for twins, ﬁZwilling, Zw
illingﬂ (ph 445). Do you 
recall that? 
I: We  heard that also but it didn™t mean a
nything. We llŠ ma ybe it di
d but I don™t– because I 
reme mber that we went with our mo ther to th
e hospital to be– whateverŠ to be checked out 
and the reason I reme mb er this Œ I love to tell th
is story Œ the reason I remember this is because 
he (Rene) wa s such a cry-baby when it came to doc
tors. Now, I was scared that he was going to 
cry and that they were going to beat him up or
 hit him, because I was such a stoic. (Laughs) 
So some body examined you two and your mother? 
I: I reme mb er that she was with us, one time, sh
e was there with us. But that mi ght have been 
when they knew that we were twins. 
Did you two, did you know you were twins?  It
 mi ght sound like a silly question, but– 
I: I don™t think so.  

17
R: No, no. It had no me a ning. It took on meaning 
later, I think, when we were separated and I 
first got into the group of the ma le 
twins that I realized 
I was a twin. Even the
n, I wa sn™t sure that 
I knew that it was different than being just
 a normal kid. But what it really meant uh– 
So after it wa s ﬁHarausﬂ  out of the cars
, you were taken directly to this Lager? 
I: This ba rrac k, yeah, this Lager wher e all the ot
he r Czech families were and my recollections of 
then are reallyŠ again, we were with our moth
er, there was very little foodŠ I reme mber we 
used to get a piece of dark, black bread and 
um–some kind of slop to drinkŠ I don™t know, 
some thing that tasted awful and but I recall s
eeing people beaten in th
at Lager, I don™t know 
why. But– 
Were there just women and children in that Lager or did it seem like whole fa milies were 
together?  
I: I think it seemed like whol
e fa milies were together. Bu
t I am not– what do you recall? 
R: I don™t have any recollection of any of this until
 we were separated and then I start to pick up 
me mories. Because I was totally on my own the
n, and then I really had to– it seems like we 
were really guarded. I just don™t reme mber 
any of the outside things that happened.  
I: I reme mb er, some times we had to stand outside
 in the mornings for some thing or other-when 
our mother was there-I don™t know.  
Any other recollections of your day in this Lage
r?  Do you think you were just in there the whole 
day or–until these Appells came  about?   
I: I have no– 

R: Not in that period. I start reme mb ering after we were separated, I started to have day activities 
and then I start reme mbe r ing our morning roll calls uh– I reme mber the bigger and older were 
taken off to work and uh– 
Where were you taken then?  You were removed– 

I: At some  point, I think it was in March of th
at year or April or whatever, ma ybe in June– 
R: ‚44 

I: No, it was ‚43 

R: No, ™44. We got there in– 
I: That™s right, Decembe r ™43, so some ti me  in ™
44, I recall one particular terribl e day when I just 
recall that we  were ripped away from our mo
ther and I recall a loud scream and um– I knew 
some thingŠ some thing had happened. You know, so
me thing was happening that was terrible.  

18
Was it your scream that you heard or– 
I: I think it was my mot her™s. 
R: I think it was my mother™s. 
I: She was trying to hold on to us
 and we were just grabbed– 
R: Pulled away from he rŠ 
I: Pulled away from her and– 
This was within the Lager?  
I: Yeah, inside. And then the next thing I knew,
 I was in someplace di fferent with just other 
wome n and girls and Rene wasn
™t there anymore and my mo
m wasn™t there anymore.  
How were you taken to this new place?  Do you 
reme mber, were you walked, or did they put you 
in a truck or–? 
I: I don™t recall. 
What are your recollecti
ons about this?  (To Rene) 
R: Sa me . The very same . And then I was just th
ere in this new surrounding
-it was very close to 
one of the ovens Œ the Cr ematoria Œ because I 
saw people walking in cons tantlyŠ one way. And 
that is where I start reme mber
ing how my days were Œ hunting 
through garbage for a potato and 
seeing these daily beatings in the roll call lines 
in the mornings. Also, ve
ry vividly, I reme mber, 
prisoners Œ the Russian soldiers and the Polish so
ldiers Œ they were shot.  They were lined up 
against the ditch and they were 
just shot. And the children Œ I wa
s just six years old Œ we would 
look over the pit and see some of
 them still twitching and I reme mber pulling Œ not me , but some  
of the older boys Œ they pulled one fe llow out who 
was obviously still alive but he did have a big 
swelling in his head Œ which had to be a bulle
t most probably Œ and they took him into the 
barracks and put him on one of the bunks. I don™t know
 what happened to him. But these things 

happened almost daily Œ the shootings. Some body wa
s always being shot. There I also reme mber 
the sirens Œ they were more frequent occurrences 
as the war grew Œ the sirens and the hum of the 
airplanes above and alwa ys an S.S. trooper standing 
in front of  the barrack s at the time, outside.  
I am just going to pause this for one second.  
*START OF SIDE TWO (2)-COUNTER 625 
So Rene, you were taken from your mother
 and brought to La ger B-2B uh–how were you 
initiated into the new Lager?  What do you re
me mber first about comi ng there?  Did anybody 
show you theŠ 

19
R: Yeah, there was concern by older people who were like me Œ they were twins, this I know 
now Œ and one of their big concerns 
was getting me  a pair of shoes.  
You were barefoot at the time?   
R: I must have been, or ma ybe they didn™t fit 
or some thing. I needed shoes, and somehow they 
ma naged through the black ma rket to get me  shoes for a loaf of bread.  I even reme mbe r  the 

color of the shoes Œ they were a yucky brow
n, you know Œ up to here. They covered the kneeŠ 
no, not the knee, the ankle. And they were like, you know, a caramel color brown. But they were 

almost like brand new and so I felt like I was be
ing taken care of, but it wa s a totally different 
existence. I was really– my eyes were opene
d, I questioned like, ﬁWhat™s going on? ﬂ  ﬁ Who is 
the ma ster of this? ﬂ  I reme mber asking, ﬁWho is 
in charge here? ﬂ  You know like who can I ask? 
Who can I talk to?  And in the 
background, all the mornings, the co
ld, the hunt for potatoes in the 
garbage and the endless lines of
 people walking to this–and– 
Did you go around with other twins 
or the other people in the– 
the other children looking for 
scraps? 
R: I always reme mber being al
one. Totally alone. 
I know they were there but the hunt was 
always alone.  

Do you remember a time that you we re especial
ly successful in finding some thing to eat?  A 
substantial pi ece of br
ead, a whole potato?   
Yeah, these mome nts happened, but 
I had to go inside and have it 
cut up so that I could warm it 
on the stove inside.  
You war me d the potato? 
R: Yeah, there were mome nts. They were wonderful mo ments when you found some thing that 
you could really eat but nothing really substantia
l like finding a box or anything like that. Maybe 
a big potato that wasn™t tota
lly rottenŠ that was a find.  
You me ntioned that you were questioning ma
ny things. Did you– what 
did people tell you or– 
what did you ask about this proc
ession going into the gas chambers? 
R: I never asked that, that wa
s just some thing that was happening. But I asked, ﬁWho i s the 
master of– who is the master of the world? ﬂ I 
think I asked. I was told ﬁHitlerﬂ  Okay. I was 
satisfied. That was an answer. 
The prisoners answered you that. 
R: Yeah. And part of, I guess, daily activity Œ I ha
ve to retell Œ is the sleeping thing at night. On 
these bunk be ds and ____(?? ph 55) and so close 
to the wood, smelling it and also getting pushed 
and many times, just being able to squeeze in
 some place, to have a space. But alone.  

20
Did you always sleep in the same  approxima te spot? 
R: I was just asking mys e lf the same  ques
tion. I don™t reme mber. I don™t recall. Do you 
reme mber anything about that in your–? 
I: We ll, you know, my memories are a little different
 than Rene™s. But we did have bunk beds as 
well, and there was this long oven down the cente
r, and I think we were somewhat assigned to 
beds, but I am not sure that everybody always went
 to these same  beds. I particularly reme mber 
one night, having to get up and having to go to th
e bathroomŠ well, not that they had bathrooms 
but– outside in the back, and then comi ng back and 
getting totally confused as to what side of 
the barrack my bed was on. And I rea
lly got into a state of panic, 
but I knew I had 
to get into a 
bed, and I kept going overŠ you know, I would go 
over and ask some body if I could just come  
in next to them, and I reme mber being pushed 
away and them saying, ﬁThis is not your bed.ﬂ 
And the mor e  his happened, you know I just was 
panicking, and so I reme mber climbing over 
the oven and saying well ma ybe– I was so conf
used. And finally some body had pity on me  and 
let me come in with them.   
Was anybody taking–did anybody ﬁadoptﬂ you? 
I: No. There was just no kind of or
ganization of any sort. It seemed 
to me that most of the girls 
were older. I didn™t really see too ma nyŠ certain
ly not younger than me Š 
I don™t recall. And no 
one seemed to be in charge and I– I reme mber 
particularly being extremely, extremely lonely. It 
was like the worst thing. There was no one. And 
I reme mber that we would receive bread and 
some  soup, and I tried to save my piece of bread, I 
figured that if I held on to it longer that I 
would have it for the whole day. But then some body 
always stole it from me  at night. Now, I 
don™t know if it was somebody else or it was the rats
 who ate it, but I never had it in the morning. 
And um–di d I learn?  No, I did this
 every night. I reme mber that 
there we re two girls that were 
with me  and they had little pouches, and they used
 to hide their bread in
 the little pouches.   
It was a separate pouch? 
I: Yeah, a little thing– I– and I would say, oh I 
wish I had one of thoseŠ but I didn™t. Um– I 
vividly also reme mber going to the hospital. 
And being sick. And I reme mber standingŠ that™s 
when I reme mber standing for roll callŠ that wa
s in Auschwitz in the morningŠ almost every 
morning.  
Once you were in that La ger– 
I: Yes, definitely. And I reme mb
er it distinctly because I alwa
ys tried to hide behind some body 
big so that I wouldn™t be seen, so that I woul
dn™t be chosen for anything. I didn™t question Œ I 
hardly spoke to anyone Œ but I was beginning to
 comprehend from what  I was hearing that 
terrible things were going onŠ that whatever wa
s happening was terrible. Although to me  at this 

timeŠ this was life and I didn™t remember anythi
ng else. I didn™t think this was wrong, right or 
otherwise. I just knew that if 
I wasn™t spotted, I wouldn™t ma ybe get chosen for some thing and 
um–I reme mbered that I could Œ from out of th
e door of the barrack Œ I could, at some  point– I 
reme mbered that I had a brother, and I reme mbered
 that he was to the ri
ghtŠ this way. And if I 

21
looked out this way, then his barr
ack was there. And I reme mber th
is on a night in particular 
when there was some  ki nd of explosion and ther
e was a big fire and I 
was terr ified that his 
barrack was the one that was on fire. Um– I re me
mber often seeing people
 run into the fence 
and uh–get electrocut ed. And I remember on one 
particular occasionŠ and there were dead 
bodies on the ground, I reme mber one time trying to hide among these dead bodies. I don™t 
exactly know whyŠ I don™t know what it was I was s
cared of, I think I just
 wanted to disappear 
and thought that ma ybe this was a 
good, convenient way to do it.  
These were bodies outside th
e barrack, stacked up or–? 
I: Yeah, just–right. And I thought 
that this way, I could hide so
me how and it would all be over. 
I don™t really know wha t  went th
rough my mi nd. It wa
s a child™s idea Œ you 
know Œ be still like 
everybody else and no one will notice me. 
What about the other children 
in that particular La ger? 
I: There were some  older children but I againŠ 
it seemed like they hung around with each other. 
So now, later on, I know that they were other tw
in girls, so I guess th
at they hung around with 
each other. I didn™t ha ve my twinŠ because he wa
s– we were not of the same  sex so it was a 
little harder. But throughout all the time  in 
the hospital and through experime nts and through 
horrible times, I always felt that Re
ne was alive and I said that I have
 to st ay alive to take care of 
him. This was like my mi ssion in life and I ve
ry clearly remember um
m– standing on line Œ it 
was always cold, of course Œ and we were going 
into the showers, standing naked and again. I 
bring up the locket Œ for a long time , I was mi racul
ously able to hang on, hide
 the fact that I had 
this locket, and always put it b
ack on after I came  out of the 
showers. I also reme mber that 
some how I knew already that not everybody came  out
 of the showers, so every time  we were 
lined up like this, I reme mber that fear, li
ke oh my God, is this the last time?   
After the shower you would be lined up? 
I: NoŠ before. Before. 
What happened when you got sick? 
I: I was in the hospital. 
Did you get yourself to the hospital or– 
I: I think somebody else must have. Periodically, I 
was taken to the hospi tal because I had certain 
me dical procedures I guess, done to me Š likeŠ 
againŠ I don™t reme mber exactly why, or what 
for, or the very detailed specifics. But I can 
remember that, at one poi
nt, I had blood taken out 
from my nec k. You know– I don™t– but it is vi
vid because it was extremely painful. And 
another time, I was strapped to a table of some  
sort, and there was a doctor Œ he was in white and 
he had a scalpel. We ll, I didn™t know it was a sc
alpel then. I realize it 
now that it was– and 
um– he cut me . And I reme mber also being x-raye
d. I reme mber a lot of x-rays, kind of stuff 
and of course being measured and stuff like th
at. But I also reme mber Œ and I don™t know what 
this has to do with anything Œ but wires. Wi
res attached to me  and um– s o me thing with 

22
electric– I don™t know. And, I reme mber, um– reme
mber seeing in one roomŠ in s o me  room, 
I don™t know– there were eyes. Don™t ask me Š 
Like eyes? Just independent eyes? 
I: I don™t know. But I also reme mb
er getting injections that ma de
 me  very sick because then I 
found myself in kind of a hospital bed or some
thing and um– I reme mb er throwing up a lot and 
having diarrhea, and I wa s extremely sick. I reme
mber though that there wa s some  nurse there 
who kind of looked after me , and I think there wa
s one point when they were cleaning out the 
hospital. I don™t knowŠ again, now, they were 
probably just going to 
kill everybody, I am not 
sure, but there–it was a very 
hurried kind of thing. There was a big commotion and this person 
grabbed me  and just stuck me  under her skirt and it 
was all dark and she just said be quiet. You 
knowŠ she didn™t have to tell me  twice and um–I think she saved me , I think she saved me  
from something– I don™t know.  
When the doctor cut you, do you remember anything about it? 
I: I just remember I mus t  have fainted or– I 
don™t reme mber  anything else after that except 
waking up in a lot of pain.  
And during any of those examinations, you were never with Rene? 

I: No. The only time I reme mber being with him 
is when we went with our mo m that time. I 
don™t ever reme mber being there again with Rene
. ‚Cause I never saw you again after that. At 
least I don™t reme mber seeing you.  
R: I was there a couple of times, but nothing like
– at least I don™t recallŠ
 the only thing I recall 
is being measured, the touch of the very cold 
instrume nts and the word ﬁRunkenﬂ Œ that™s x-ray, 
I think, in German. I reme mber that. So there wa
s a lot of that going on but
 that™s about all.  
What were the measurements? 
R: Around the head, body, head, everything. Because 
they were sort of trying to– they were 
putting you in between some thing, to see how, I gu
ess how bigŠ it wasn™t like they we re taking 
a tape measure, they put you ag
ainst some thing cold, steelŠ 
I: There was steel, it was very cold. 

R: Very cold. 
Who was the person doing the procedure?  Um, 
did they talk to you or ask you anything? 
I: Um, I just reme mber being terrified, and I 
knew that I had to just not cry and just do 
everything that I was told. No ma tter what.  
When you were– How was it that you knew you were taken to be examined?  Did, one morning, 
some bodyŠ soldier come in and take you, or di
d you know that on a particular day you would 
go?   
R: I was walked over by one of the older boys. I am
 sure that I was the youngest kid there. I was 
walked over by one of the older boys and that was it.  

23
Do you have a recollection of the ﬁtwins™ father? ﬂ  The gentlema n Zvi Spegel (ph 202)? 
R: He could have been the one. I know of hi m on
ly in– 1985, I learned of him.  I me t [hi m] in 
Israel , Zvi Spegel. 
Did he reme mber you? 
R: No. I think his mi nd was sort of on the blink 
at that  point . But ther
e was somebody else in 
1985 who reme mbered me , which was very heartwarmi ng. 

I: And he was part of Zvi Spegel™s group.  
R: And he was part of that 
group so obviously I was there.  
Some of the other male twins have described se
eing each ot he r– seeing the Soviet pr isoners in 
the next half of the barracks. Do
 you recall any older me n there?   
R: Yeah. The only– the Soviet– the soldiers, I 
reme mber they were periodically shot, they 
were the ones that were always taken 
and disposed of– the partisans (ph 214)? 
I: Do you reme mber Adolph (ph 215)? 

R: No. But the only one I would remember is th
at young kidŠ that one ot
her one that I met in 
Israel . 
I: Peter Grainfield? 
R: Yeah. Peter. Very vaguely. I me t this ma n in 
Israel and he was the onl
y one that would have 
been my size.  

I: He was about a year younger. 
R: And that was extremely young. Because I don™t
 think the older boys wouldŠ even socially 
they wouldn™t associate with us. 
Because I think that the next up wa
s at least three or  four years 
older and at that point, that is
 a big difference soŠ we were alone
, exce pt  that  I was told that  I 
played with him. And I kept 
looking at him and uh– I sort of
– it stirred some me mories, but 
nothing specific. Nothing specifi
c really. What I was going to say– You were asking about who 
did some  of the experimentati
on Œ the Museum a t  Auschwitz now has the documents, which we 
got copies of, of our na me s Œ both our name s a
nd numbers Œ matching and 
all that. Irene has a 
document where there is 
a signature of blood testing and Me
ngele™s signature on the bottom of 
it-so he could have been one of the gentle
men who participated in this-pretty sure.  
They took blood from you as well? 

R: I don™t recall them taking blood from me, no. 
But you recall the x-
ray procedures? 
R: I recall the x-rays and measuring, 
that I reme mber. The other things– 
Did these x-ray procedures take a long time? 

24
Time  didn™t have much meaning to me . It just happened. 
You both had numbers?  Y
ou were both tattooed? 
R: Yes. 

What do you recall about receiving those numbers
?  Wa s that when you first entered Auschwitz 
or when you were transferre
d to the separate Lagers? 

I: Since our numbers are 
so different, I would imagine that it
 must have been when we were 
separated because we had totally different numbers. 
R: Yeah, my  number, I reme mber it being put on
, it hurt. There was an awful stench all around 
me , it was muddy and it was like a n
eedle pricking me , but in terms of time, when they put it, I 
can™t put it anywhere.   
You said it was muddy. 
It was done outside? 
R: It was muddy when I walked up to– yeah, itwas done outside. Whoever it was, they were 
sitting at a desk with a cover 
over it but I stepped into it like
 from outside. And um– I™ll show 
you my number, I have a very cl
ear number. It reads this way: 169061. And that™s confirme d by 
some  of the records. But when I first saw that nu
mber with my name  next to it Œ also, only in the 
last few years Œ that really gave me  the chil
ls again, confirmi ng dreams, me mories of long, long 
ago. Which still affect you, I guess. I™m sure they do.  
Did anyone tell you that you had to be  account
able for this number in some way? 
R: You know, after the war, which is reallyŠ for ch
ildren, I think, the hardes
t partŠ this is like 
another Holocaust starting or use– That™s how 
I look at it. I took an awful lot of beatings 
because of this number because that identified me
 as a Jew, in Czechoslovakia, after the war, 
when everything was supposedly very nice a
nd good. There was no reli
ef for children who– 
seven years old, all alone. I mean parents can ap
preciate this sort of th
ing. When you become  a 
parent you will understand.  
Irene, do you have recollections of receivi ng a nu mber? 
I: I drew a blank on that. I do reme mber just va
guely, a needle jabbing my arm but I didn™t ma ke 
anything of it. I just saw that ev
eryone had one of thoseŠ I wa nted 
one also. I wanted to be like 
everyone else.  
You describe d an explosion you heard. Do 
you recall this explosionŠ fire comi ng out? 
R: No. But my feelings about Irene being alive,
 the way that she felt, I felt that too. And I do 
reme mber seeing her once, through the wires, an
d I knew it was her– it had to be. So me  time 
had elapsed since we were separated, uh– I thin
k it was towa rd the end, but I knew that she was 
alive because of thatŠ I just knew that she was 
alive. That just  confirme d the whole thing for 
me Š that she never di ed in my thinkingŠ she wa
s always alive in my consciousness until we 
met in the States many years later. 
What are your next me
mories about Auschwitz? 

25
R: We ll, just prior to liberation, 
there was this incident of us 
being taken and almost done away 
with by another officer other than Mengele and 
uh– very clearly do I remember this incident. 
Another doctor? 
R: I don™t know if it was a doctor, an officer. And 
I reme mb er Mengele comi ng in just in the nick 
of time in his green convertible and stopping this
 whole procession, and I also reme mber Œ and 
Irene I guess had that feeling ma ny times Œ I kne w 
that this was going to be
 deadly. I mean this 
fear instinct I guess Œ I had a fee
ling that this could be the end 
for me  Œ and the horrible feeling. 
So Mengele stopped this. And also, towards the en
d of– there was this ma rch that we all went 
on, that they ma rched us out 
of– I mean, the last week or
 soŠ weeks– again, time  is 
meaninglessŠ but I do reme mber a lot of excite
me nt a mong the German soldiers and distant 
artillery fire getting louder a
nd louder and them taking us on to this ma rchŠ that was a pretty 
gruesome  type affair because they Œ 
again Œ shot anybody or just– anybody who 
wouldn™t/couldn™t cont
inue they just– 
This was January, 1945? 
R: This was January. Right. And that was a long, l
ong haul if I reme mber. I can™t put it in terms 
of hours, but then all of a sudden the German sol d
iers were gone and the Russian soldiers were 
around us Œ in white uniforms. I re me mber one o
fficer being on a horse Œ I think it was a pink 
horse (laughs). A very bigŠ huge animal. But they
 were all dressed in white and that was the 
liberation. 
So you were en route on the ma rch?  You 
hadn™t reached anywhere in particul ar? 
R: No, no. 
And you realized that people were being 
shot if they were straggling behind? 
R: Yes. 
Do you remember ma ki ng a conscious effort toŠ 
R: Yes. I had to keep going, and she was my stre
ngth, and I knew I had to ma ke it for her, as was 
the case for many of my ot
her hardships that came about later. She gave me  the strength to keep 
going.  
Did you have a blanket 
with you or anything? 
R: Don™t recall.  

Do you recall getting any bread rations before the ma rch? 

R: Nothing. I do reme mb er the Russians ma rched 
us into a warehouse of some  kind after this 
happened and there was a tremendous scramble 
for food. I wanted to get in on this. I do 
reme mber getting a can of some kind and rollin
g it and then I finally 
got some body to open itŠ 
it was sauerkraut. That is my me mor y of this th
ing Œ big yellow, yellow, golden kind of a can Œ it 
was huge to me  then. I don™t know how big it really 
was, but I had to roll 
it, I couldn™t lift it.  
Surely, you ate it? 

26
R: I had some thing of i t . A lot 
of people didn™t do so well becau
se they overate, I  understand. 
That was liberation from Auschwitz.  
And for you Irene? 
I: I went–I must have been 
at a different camp (laughs). Ki
nd of towards the end, before 
liberation as I know it now, I sensed some th
ing had changed. Uh– there wasn™tŠ suddenly 
there wasn™t this order in the 
day anymore. We  weren™t being 
put outside, we weren™t standing– 
some how there was no order anymore and I Œ at that point Œ was, I must have been quite sick 
because I reme mber just that I was on the ground. 
I couldn™t get up.  And th
ere were other people 
also lying on the ground Œ I don™t know if it was 
because they were hungry or sick or what.  I do 
reme mber some thing had changedŠ I wasn™t qu
ite aware of whatŠ but there seemed to be 
people who were kind of a little bi
t– saying that we™re saved Œ I 
didn™t know what that meant Œ 
and the next thing I knew was that I was pick
ed up by some  Polish lady and she took me .  
Within the camp? You were
 still within the camp? 
I: In the camp, but she took me  out of the camp. So
 I was not part of this
 ma rch Œ you know, that 
was not me  Œ I was already gone. A
nd um–I was with her a while.  
Where did she take you? 
I: It seemed she lived in Auschwitz, in th
e town proper, and she took me  to her house. 
For how long did you stay with her? 
I: I was there until Rescue Children 
extricated me. It must have been– 
This is an organization? 
I: Yes, an organization to get back Jewish 
children. But um– I reme mb er Christma s very 
vividly, so I was there at least 
a year. I reme mber her telling me
 that Santa Claus is going to 
come out of the moonŠ she says to
 me Š I believed her. Yeah, right! 
Did she have other children? 
I: No. 
It was just he r?  Wa s she ma rried? 
I: Um–I think she was ma rried, but I was an only child. 
I guess, I suppose you learned Polish? 
I learned Polish. 

And when did this relief orga
nization find you and take you? 
I guess about a year later and um– I first went to
 Prague to an orphanage and then I went to 
France to an orphanage and then a different orphanage blah, blah, blah– a lot of orphanages. I 
got shuttled around a bit.  

27
And Rene, after liberation and 
the warehouse, what was your– 
R: The next recollection I have, I 
understand that  I was in a hospital in Bratislava Œ so I am told Œ
and I had some  TB Œ tuberculosis Œ a touch of 
it. And the next– the me mories for me , really 
begin in Czechoslovakia in a town called Koıi
ce (Kaschau) (ph 390), in an orphanage. A big 
orphanage in a hospital complex.  
Was this specifically a Jewish orphanage? 
No. There were nuns, Mothers, around taking care.
 And uh– there was an admi nistrator there Œ 
a doctor Kelina (ph 395) who, after some  time, 
took me  out and uh– with his wifeŠ they had 
no children, and I lived with them. Subsequently, 
they had a childŠ Did they have a child?  Or 
am I mi xing it up with the other one? 
I: They didn™t have any children.  
R: No, they did not. I am mi xing him up with his 
brother. I lived with him for a while and they 
had to flee because some how the Communists– so
mebody made some statements regardingthis 
ma n and he just got wi nd of it and he had to flee
. So he left me  with hi
s sister and that™s the 
fa mily Œ the Mann fa mily Œ and lived with them for a good number of years. They were the ones 
that had the other childre
n, Bebe and Otto (ph 410) and they tr
eated me  very well. There I went 
to school Œ in Czechoslovakia Œ but
 there again, I was the only visible Jew and they were waiting 
for me  everyday after school with stones.  
So the other Czech children– 
R: There was one other Jew, I reme mber, but we
 both had to run for our young lives at the time . 
And it was a good thing that we were still young a
nd so the people that were waiting for us 
couldn™t do all that much harm. The y were still 
youngsters also, but they were serious and they 
were meanŠ so we had to run. I mean that after we were let out, we had to– 
Sprint home? 

R: Sprint home , very fas t , sprint  a long way too, 
because I lived very close to the school, they 
knew Œ they blocked my  way Œ so I had to go 
some where else. It was always a big circleŠ 
sometimes it led into the fi elds. 

What was the name  again? 

R: Kojista (ph 429). 
And the fa mily™s na me? 
R: Mann. 

M-A-N-N? 
R: Yes, M-A-N-N, Joseph Mann and– 
I: Edith. 

28
R: Edith, yes. 
This was the sister– 
R: The sister yes, of Doctor Kalina. 
Unknown Woma n: Just as an inte
resting point, later on we found 
out from people in New York 
City here, that the search for the Jewish childre
n that had been taken for a million reasons into 
Polish homes Œ Christian home s Œ the way that 
they discovered who was a Jew in these homes 
was that the rescuers would go to the town Bis
hop, or whoever was the religious cleric in the 
town, and they would ask for all th
e baptismal certificates of the 
children. And if th
ere were four 
children in one home and three baptismal certific
ates, the fourth one was the Jew. And they 
would exchange monies, or whatever the town ne
eded Œ the Bishop I am sure was paid also Œ 
and then the children were resc ued. So, because of
 that, the American Jewish Organizations were 
trying to raise funds to have monies to pa
y for these children and through one of these 
organizations called Rescue Child, th
ey were having di
nner after dinner, 
I: It was called Rescue Children. 
Unknown Woma n:–Rescue Children, 
Inc., one of them Œ the prime mover of this Œ was a 
gentlema n from Long Island and he, he went into Eu
rope to one of his orphanages that had been 
set up for all these rescued orphans and he found 
Irene in one of them. And he said, ﬁOh, you™d 
be perfect to come  back to Ameri
ca and just help us raise funds.ﬂ 
This was just, like, your picture 
perfect orphanŠ with beautiful, 
full banana curls and a sweet 
face. And some how he convinced 
her that she should come to America with him. 
and subsequently, she was ma de part of this 
Life 
Magazine
 article Œ Nov. 17, 1948– all a
bout– 1947– right, that™s how
 Irene was taken out of 
the Polish ho me, by the way. One of these emissari
es of Rescue Child– Rescue Children Inc– 
I: Well I™m not sure, ther e were 
other organizations that worked 
in Poland. I think that Rescue 
Children came into the forefr ont later on when ma
ny of these children were in France and they 
were trying to find their parents he
re in AmericaŠ find relatives for them or else ship them to 
Israel or whatever. But when I was in Poland, 
you know Rene was talking about school Œ I was 
in Œ she was obviously a Catholic ladyŠ I was in
 all Catholic school and I went to church– 
R: So did I. I went to church. 
Did you know that you were Jewish? 
R: Yes. I went to the end of the line. Many times
 I snuck away when they went to church, but 
ma ny ti me s I did go and went through 
the whole– whatever I went through. 
I: I went to Church. I knew I was Jewish because
 I had this number on my arm. I also wasŠ as 
Rene said, I also wasŠ getting very sick. Becau
se  I lay in bed, and I reme mber doctors comi ng 
and flitting in and out of fever, or whatever. A
nd um– she was a very st rict lady. I had to feed 
her bunny rabbitsŠ she had rabbits. Which she woul
d then cook. I couldn™t eat them because I 
was taking care of them. And, in the summer, sh
e had fa mily that lived out on a farm, a nd I 
reme mber that it was a very long walkŠ it took al
most half a day to get there. And there were 

other children there and I hated going there becau
se they ma de fun of 
me because I had this 
number. And nobody defended me  a
nd I cried. I cried a lot.  

29
What would they say to you? 
I: They ma de fun of me  because 
I had this numberŠ that I™m a prisoner of some  sort, they kept  
saying. I cried a lot. But, with everything, when the Jewish organization Œ which mi ght have 
been the Joint Distribution– uh I don™t know–Distr
ibution Co., came to pull me  out of that 
home , I had really come  to like being Catho
lic. I thought it was like– 
nifty. You know, Church, 
the whole bit, rosary beads. And I didn™t want 
to leave Œ you know I really did not Œ I was very 
upset. I remember the first orphanage where 
I came to, I met somebody who I am still friends 
with to this day Œ her name  is
 Miriam, she lives in Israel. An
d she was about seven years older 
than me , and she kind of became my mother fi
gureŠ but she had also ha d– was from Poland 
and we were both sitting there with the Rosary beads plotting our escape from this orphanage 
because we wanted to go back, you know. 
Back to Poland? 

I: Right. 
This was when you were in Prague? 
I: Yes.  

So they removed you to Prague and fr
om Prague you were taken to Paris. 
I: Yeah, I wa s outside of Paris in 525, and th
at™s where I was selected actually by Herbert 
Tenszer Œ he used to be a Congressman from here
 Œ and he chose me  to come . And he promised 
me  that he would send me  backŠ promised. He  didn™t keep his promise. 

So you came to New York at that time ?  

I: Yeah. 
And Rene, you had an exodus out of Europe also?   
R: Well, my  exodus really tied t
o–related to her being taken in
 by some body who lived out here 
on Long Island. A friend of Herbert Te nzer Œ waswidely active in the organization Œ Mayer and 
Dina Slotkin Œ which is my na me
 now Œ Rene Slotkin. And they t
ook Irene in and that had to be 
maybe like ™48.  
I: Yeah, it was at one point before I came  to th
e m, I was with the Novicks, and they dragged out 
of me that I had a brother. Because
 I had never spoken about it and– 
R:So they took Irene into their home, right here 
in the Five Towns, and then they started to 
search for mi ssing Rene. And it is 
a long and fascinating story but uh– 
Life Magazine
 was 
some how instrume ntal in locating me because th
is Dr. Kalina that I me ntioned, had escaped. He 
had gone to Israel and some how– 
Was he Jewish? 
R: Yes. And he had gotten hold of this 
Life Magazine,
 and in it, he saw Irene as Irene Guttman. 
The name s c licked and he put it together Œ so 
he got in touch some how with some body here in 
New York and told them that I was living in 
Czechoslovakia with his 
sister. And they Œ the 

30
Slotkins Œ sent some body over into
 Europe to get me  out. And ther
e was a lot of red tape, I had 
to go through Germany and docume ntation and Swit
zerland for a whileŠ not a direct route, and 
uh– I finally ended up– 
I: 1950Š 
R: 1950, March 29, in Idlewild Airport, rainy nightŠ
 I™ll never forget that and we were reunited 
on that evening.  
So you reme mbered your last name . There wasno reason why you should reme mber that your 
last name  was Guttman, but I suppose you did.  
R: We ll, why?  That was my na me , all the wa
y through until– that was always my name Š I 
knew my na me .  

I: The Polish lady changed my na me  from Renatta to Ivenka (ph 588). So that™s how Irene came . 

Unknown Woma n: Zvi Spegel also reinforced 
everybody™s identity in the campŠ for the boys. 
He would have the boys– a newcomer come  in right
 away, and they were gr
eeted in like a circle 
and everybody would introduce themse
lves so their name s were constantly being reinforced and 
who they were. 
End of Tape 1 counter number 598 
Tape 2 

I: It is only in retrospect now 
that June is talking about it a lit
tle that I do reme mber when I was 
in Poland, that every once in a wh
ile we would take this long wa
lk Œ it seemed like a long walk 
to me  Œ and we would shift through this mountain of ashes Œ looking Œ she told me  I should be 
looking for gold. And it was just– I c
ouldn™t stand doing it– it was just– 
So these were crematory ashes then? 
I: It was just the worst. The worst. It was horri
ble. And in the town where she lived Œ right across 
Œ her apartment kind of faced this village square
 Œ but to the right, down the road, was where the 
Russian soldiers were housed and I recall that she would sometimes send me  there with things 
to– 
To trade or  what? 
I: I don™t know what, it was al
ways wrapped up. So she would ma
ke me go there, and I hated 
going there because I was afraid of these Russian
 soldiers-although they were very nice Œ I was 
scared of soldiers Œ it was a soldier and myrecollection of soldiers was not some body that I 
wanted to deal with Œ not after Auschwitz, so it
 was very scary for me  
Œ but she would ma ke me  
go. I have no idea what transpired.  
R: I do want to say one thing about
 the Slotkin family. That it is amazing to me  now that I am a 
parent and have children, that 
they had the willingness and uh–the
 char ity to extend themselves 
to a war orphan like Irene and then not knowi
ng at all what I would 
be like, certainly a 
questionable background. And to spend these 
huge amounts of funds to send some body to 

31
Europe to get me , to bring me  over here and to 
adopt me  at the age of 12– I am not sure that I 
could do it, knowing where I came fr om. I just don™
t knowŠ I really have to say that these were 
the most ma rvelous people to be able to do su
ch a thing. And uh–I thin
k that there are other 
stories like that too. The Jewish community real
ly went out at that time, once they knew what 
was going on really and in the open 
and things like this and I th
ink that this should be known. I 
think the atrocities of what happened should be
 known, but I think that some  of the good things 
that came about should 
also be publicized.  
When did you learn what became of your mother?  
Or did you seek out the information, did you 
ever confirm what happened to her? 
R: It was confirme d in ™85, when we went to th
is museum in (ph 034), Is
rael. But I think I knew, 
right then and there when it happened. 
What about your father?  Did you 
ever find out when and where he was sent?  Wa s that ever 
obtainable? 
R: It was found out.  
June: Some time in December 1941, he was taken 
to Auschwitz, because the records came  
backŠ one record that we have of his demi se
 says December 1941. And he mi ght have been one 
of the earliest prisoners that actually helped at  
Birkenau. That was when it was being built. They 
sent it political prisoners at th
at time  and he 
fit that bill. 
Because of his import/export background? 
R: Therefore accusations  of spy activity. 
Unknown Woma n: It seems that he was th
e first sent to the Petschek (Petschk
$
v) (ph042) prison 
Œ which was actually the Petschek Palace and th
e Nazis turned it into an interrogation pr ison 
from where no one ever returned. We learned– 
got this from other people who lived in 
Czechoslovakia at the time and we me t the m in 1985. 

R: I do reme mber going with our mo
ther to a place with packages. 
Unknown Woma n: Maybe you went to visit. 

R: Maybe. I don™t reme mber visiting or seeing, 
but I do reme mber going to this very sound, 
fortress-like structure and bringing packages. 
Unknown Woman: There™s a marker 
outside the Petschek now with the name s of all the people 
who went through thereŠ so it™s possibl
e that their dad™s name  is on it. 
What was his name ?  
R: Herbert. Herbert Guttman.  
There are some  docume nted stories 
from some of the other twins,
 at least for the boys, about 
playingŠ being taken to a field to play soccer
. Do you have any recolle
ctions about anything 
like that? 

32
R: Obviously I wasn™t big enough to be picked
 for the team. No, I don™t reme mber. I played 
soccer after the war in Czechoslovaki a, a little 
bi t like a national pastime, like baseball is here. 
Unknown Woma n: One of the older 
twins who talked to us in 
1985 Œ and he just me ntioned Œ 
that Rene wa s shepherded by this communist. Zv
i Spegel set each person in kind of a pecking 
order. This twin had to take care of that twin, or
 this person had to take care of that twin and 
since Rene and Pepe Œ Peter Grainfield Œ were 
the youngest, they were given an adult ma le, and 
this fellow was name d Otto, and he was the one 
who kind of kept Rene aw
ay from the wires.
