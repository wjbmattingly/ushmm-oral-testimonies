Question: This is the United States Holocaust  
Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview 
with Ruth Alper, conducted by Esther Finder on December 22
nd
, 1999 in Rockville, Maryland. 
This is tape number one, side
 A. Wh at is your full name? 
Answer: Ruth Hagan Alper. 

Q: And wha t  was your name  at birth? 

A: Ruth Hagan. 

Q: When we re you born? 

A: February 18, 1932. 

Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: I was born in Marktberg, Germany. 
Q: What were your parents™ name s? 
A: Bertha Weisenberg Hagan. Isaac Hagan. 

Q: Did you have any brothers, sisters? 

A: I have a brother tw
o years younger, Max Hagan. 
Q: What do you reme mb er of your childhood in Ge
rmany?  Can you tell me  about your home?  
A: I -- we lived in an apartment on the second fl
oor. There was a -- a hill there. We had a small 
car with a rumble seat and some
ti me s we would dra -- ri -- get a 
ride in the rumble seat. And I 
was -- I lived near my aunt and uncle, Esther an
d Herschel Hagan, and I played with my younger 
cousins, Manny and Jackie. And I reme mber 
going down to -- with my brother down the 
apartment steps and we went into the car and 
started the car and some
body saw us and stopped

us cause we were rolling down the hill, he ha
d released the brake. And I -- oh, I started 
kindergarten in regular school, a
nd a few months after I was in 
the school the teacher called my 
mother in and said, Frau Hagan, this is not 
my policy, but your daughter
 can no longer stay in 
this public school, she has to go to a Jewish school
. So I went to a Jewish school with a Jewish 
teacher. And he was there for a few months and 
then one day we went to school and he  was no 
longer there, he had gotten papers to come  to Am
erica. So there for awhile I was out of school, 
there was no school. 
Q: Was your hometown a -- a large town, or was it small? 

A: I would say it™s a me dium size town and it 
was an industrial town. 
There were a lot of 
factories there. 

Q: Wa s there a large Jewish community there? 

A: I don™t know. We  ha d Jewish friends and we 
did go to synagogue, so there were some  Jewish 
people there, but I don™t know wh
ether -- the ex
tent of it. 
Q: Did your fa mily have a long history in Germany? 

A: They got -- they left Poland in 1919, so th
ey were there from 1919 to 1939. They were never 
allowed to become  citizens, you had to be in Germany 30 yea r s before, so they were statenloss; 

people without a state. My father always went
 to work, he did selling house to house, bought 
things at the wholesale pl ace, sold them and ma
de a living, cause we were never depr ived of 
anything, we  had food and clothing. 

Q: Do you know why your fa mily moved from Poland to Germany?  

A: Yes, they moved there because of economic
 reasons. They were very, very poor, and my 
granduncle, at the age of 15 was ca
ught playing cards, and then he sa
id he never wanted to stay 
in that place because of this [indecipherable] a
nd he -- he left very early to go to Germany, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129

then came to America. He then grew up, b-b
ecame a good businessman in Detroit, Michigan, 
and he was the ma n that signed the affidavits for us
 to come  here, that if 
we couldn™t sup -- if my 
father couldn™t support us, he would support us. 
Q: Do you know where in Poland your fa mily is from?  

A: Nowy Za ndak. 

Q: What work did your mother do? 

A: My mother was a home maker, but my father 
always had a paperwork th
at had to be done, and 
she helped him with the accounts. She spoke a go
od English once we got to America. My father 
always spoke all the languages that he had 
ever encountered, Polish, German, Spanish, then 

English, so that he never -- he went to business,
 but he never got the hang of the language the 
way my mot her did. 

Q: Wa s your fa mily religiously observant? 

A: Yes, they were. They -- we lived -- I couldn™t go -- do anything on Saturday. I went to -- well, 
in Miami I went to Hebrew school and then 
stayed home on Saturday. 
A-And we observed all 
the holidays and we were kosher at 
that time . Mostly we were Orthodox. 
Q: When you were a child growing up in
 Germany, did you have a favorite holiday? 
A: When I was growing up in Germany -- we
 didn™t do much about Hanukah, as I wa -- 
Passover, because we would all 
get together, with the fam -- w
ith the aunt and uncle and my 
cousins. 
Q: And wha t  language did you speak in your home ?  

A: German.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129

Q: When you were a little gi
rl, did you experience any anti-Semitism, other than what you 
me ntioned to me  in the school, did you, in your 
playtime  with your friends, anything like that 
ever experience anti-Semitism? 
A: No, not that I reme mber. Not in Germany, no. 

Q: You ever see Hitler or -- 
or the Nazis in your travels? 
A: No, I didn't see Hitler, but I was there Kristallnacht and we went out on the street  and saw all 

the windows had been smashed and there was glass 
all over the streets. So that was my me mory 
of the -- of the beginning of the bad times.  

Q: What can you reme mber about Kristallnac
ht?  Did you know what was happening during the 
evening? 

A: A wa -- there was a -- a neighbor who said we 
shouldn™t go out at night the night of krysta -- 
the night before Kristallnacht because some thi
ng bad was happening. So he was trying to warn 
us about some thing like that. So we stayed i
n. Then the next day we did go out and walked 
around and saw the destruction. And then that mo rni
ng my uncle was arrested and sent to -- Ben 
Bruner, that was my uncle, he was arrested and 
sent to a concentration camp. He later got out 
because my Aunt Esther bribed one of the Gest
apo people to get him out so he could come to 
America with us.  

Q: Before Kristallnacht had there been a
ny me ntion of your family going to America? 
A: No, because my father was against going. He said
 that this would pass, 
that it™s not as bad as 
people were saying. But my Aunt Esther, younge
r than my mo ther, she was the motivating 
factor. She said to my mother, pack the suitcases
, pack the boxes, we™re leaving. And my father 
came along with us, even though he felt that it w
ould not be so bad. There were people in my 
fa mily who left earlier. My Uncl
e Beryl was in Detroit already a
nd of course grand-uncle Jassie 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
5 
 
was in Detroit. But he had gone muc h earlier, for economic reason. Beryl went because he 
realized things were getting bad. 

Q: Is there anything else that 
stands out in your mi nd about the time up to Kristallnacht, from 
your childhood?  Any other me mories? 

A: No, I can™t reme mber  anything that happened. 

Q: When your fa mily decided to move
, how was the move explained to you? 
A: We ll, my  mother was very capable of taking ca
re of us, and she said we  were going to have 
an adventure, and we would be going halfway 
around the world. And so I felt as long as she felt 
it was an adventure, I was going to go along. And 
she ma de  it easy for my brother and myself. 
We didn™t worry. They were very wo
rried, but we didn™t, as children. 
Q: We re you aware that they were worried? 

A: Yes, I realized that things 
were getting tense, and that Es
ther and Bertha and everybody was 
anxiously preparing for this trip.  
Q: Did your parents have any tr
ouble getting out of Ger many? 
A: Well, they got the affi davit fr om Uncle Jassie in Detroit. The -- the hard part  was that my 
grandparents wouldn™t come . And so
 they left them in Ha mburg, Germany, and my two aunts 

and my mother, they had to say goodbye to their 
mother and father, and that was very difficult. 
And my mother really never got ove
r it, I don™t think Ceet
a ever got over it either. They went to 
Poland, and we have letters from Pol a nd where they
™re living in an apartment and letters that we 
sent and packages that we sent were opene
d up and -- by the censors and money and food was 
taken out, so that they would get 
a little bit of what we had se
nt, but not very much. And that 
happened through 1940 -- ™39 - ™40 - ™41, then ™42 
we had no more correspondence, they died. 
Q: Do you reme mber what arrangeme nt
s were ma de for your departure? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
6 
 
A: This is hard to believe but my aunt contac
ted a rabbi and he -- you co
uldn™t take much mone y 
out. And she gave him our money and for every 
14 ma rks that we gave him, she me t him in 
Belgium, he  gave us back a dolla -- a ma rk. So we
 had little money as we left Belgium, and there 
were people who got off at Belgium and I reme
mb er waving goodbye to friends and then we 
never saw them again, and then we continued to Cuba. 
Q: So your objective was Cuba? 

A: No, our objective was United States of America,
 but there was a quota system in America, we 
couldn™t get in. In fact, the arra
ngements we had to ma ke to go to Cuba was that we were going 
there on vacation, which is what we sa
id on the papers, going on vacation.  
Q: Since you were going on a vacation, as you sa
id, were you able to
 say goodbye to people? 
A: Yes, we said goodbye to our friends who lived
 in the apartment house. And of course my 
close relatives, very fortunately were able 
to come  with us. Uncle Ben, who was in the 
concentration camp, my Aunt Esther bribed a Ge
stapo and they let him out . Her story is that 
Hitler was willing for Jews to leave if they c
ould get out some how, and we -- she went ahead and 
got the papers and we -- as we sa
id, a -- a vacation to Cuba, but our 
intention was never to stay in 
Cuba, to come  to America.  
Q: Were ther e any last mi nute glitches before you could leave? 

A: No, other than saying goodbye 
to my grandparents and having them go to Poland, which was 
the first place that they went.  

Q: You me ntioned that you coul
d not take out a lot of money. 
A: Right. 

Q: What could you take out of Ger many?  What --
 what did your parents take and what did you 
take? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129

A: My parents took out a sterling 
silver set co -- silverware. A 
big sewing machine, it™s a -- was a 
piece of furniture, and a beautiful st erling silver
 candelabr a and I have the candelabr a, which I 
will give  to my daughter so that 
she will know that this is somethi
ng else that she can take with 
her. I don™t reme mber what I took. I -- all I reme mb
er was wearing a short dr
ess, but most of the 
time that™s what I wore, dresses. I don™
t reme mber toys or 
anything like that. 
Q: What did you most regret 
leaving behind, for you personally? 
A: Having to leave my school, and the peopl
e that I knew in sc
hool. That was all. 
Q: When did you leave your home?  

A: 1939. 

Q: Do you know the date? 

A: Perhaps January, 1939, cause I feel that we 
were on the ship in February, and took a few 
weeks, we had to go to Ha mburg and ma ke arra
ngeme nts for my grandparents. They did get an 
apartment in Poland, but -- 
Q: How did you travel fro
m your home to Ha mburg? 
A: By train, we went by train. 
Q: How old were you at the 
time  you left your home ?  
A: I was seven years old. 

Q: When you get -- when you got to
 Ha mburg, how long were you there? 
A: We  were there a few weeks,
 until we got on the ship, and 
the ship was the Oronoco and a -- 
my cousin says that after we were dropped o
ff in Cuba by the Oronoco that the next time the 
Oronoco sailed, it was torpedoed. So I don™t know 
if we have any record -- we don™t have any 
records of the Oronoco, I thought ma ybe the Holocaust Museum mi ght. 

Q: Do you know what registry
 it [indecipherable] under? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
8 
 
A: No, no, just the name , that stuck with me . 
Q: Let™s stay in Germany 
just a little big longer -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- we™ll go back to the ship. You me ntioned saying goodbye and th
en leaving and going on 
the ship. Did you have any problems at all actually leaving German territory? 

A: Not that I recall. 

Q: I asked you if you knew what registry the ship
 had, was it German registry, or was it other 
than German regist ry? 

A: We ll, it had a Spanish name , the Oronoco is a ri
ver in South America. I don™t know if that had 

anything to do with it. 

Q: When did you realize that you we re
 no longer in German control? 
A: When I was on the ship. And there, life wa
s some what norma l. My parents and everybody got 
very seasick, but I didn™t. So I con
tinued eating and running around the ship.  
Q: Can you describe the ship a little bit to me ?  
Te ll me  how large it was,
 at least how large it 
seemed to you as a seven year old? 

A: Yeah, right. It seemed like a very large sh
ip, and we ate at a di
ning room table like you 
would, I don™t know like a cruise li
ner, but to me  it was a large ship and we  had room to run 
around on the deck and my brother and I played 
on the deck. Oh well, my  Aunt Ceeta, the 
younger of the three sisters that were comi ng ove
r, because it was such a rough voyage her baby 

could not keep any food down and died on the shi
p. And I remember this, he was buried at sea, 
and my Aunt Ceeta never got over that. That was 
a trauma that  stayed with her all her life. 
Q: Wa s the child si ck before the voyage? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
9 
 
A: No, child was alright, but
 he was s -- it was a boy, six 
weeks old, couldn™t hold the food 
down. So became, I suppose seasick like the re
st of the people and died from dehydration. 
Q: Can you tell me  what  the cr -- the crossing 
was like for the adults? 
From your perspective, 
what could you see the adults going through? 
A: We ll, they were worried about what life w
ould be like, they would 
talk about the language. 
My mother and my aunt s started studying Englis
h, since that was our destination, in Ge rmany. 
So they were studying even onboard, when they
 would sit out on the deck. They had their 
English-German dictionary and they would try to
 converse with each othe
r in English. And then 
of course there was the problem of l earning Sp
anish, which I don™t think they studied until they 
got over to Cuba. So a lot of the time they we
re talking about how we
 would make a living -- 
how they would ma ke a living and how they w
ould get along with the language. That was the 

ma in topic of conversation. 

Q: Besides your fa mily [indeciphera
ble] who were the other passengers? 
A: I me ntioned that there were some
 fr iends of my fa mily that were left  off in Belgium, so they 
were refugees like us. Seems to 
me  that they -- it was a boatloa
d of refugees, people who were 
fleeing from Europe because they knew it was bad. 
Q: How long was the crossing? 

A: Seems to me  it was two weeks, but they ha
d to stop the ship because of some problems, 
mechanical problems, so we were on the ocean for awhile. And then that was repaired, so it took 

about two weeks. 

Q: And besides running around the 
deck with your brother, wh
at did you do during those two 
weeks during the day? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
10 
 
A: I do reme mber now we brought some  books, s o I 
was reading and that was in German, cause I 
was trying to learn a little Englis
h also, but that -- I didn™t learn 
too much there. I learned more 
when I came  to the United States. Pl ayed with my  cousins because we were all very close 

together. My father and my uncle 
were brothersand my mother and 
my aunt were sisters. So two 
mothers, two wome n married to two brothers 
-- two sisters married two brothers, so my 
relationshi p with my cousins were 
double, very close, almost like
 brothers and sister. I was the 
only girl, everybody else was a boy, so I had a very 
close relationship wi th Aunt Esther because 
she always wanted a girl. 

Q: When you were on the ship, what we
re your expectations for when you land? 
A: I was hoping I could ma ke some
 friends in Cuba and learn th
e language. And I did, when I 
got to Cuba, I started learning Spanish, spoke  German. I started studying English with my 

mother and my aunt there in Cuba. They would si
t in the park while we played, and studied. And 
of course then I started learning 
English. So at that time  I wa s tr
ilingual. That di
dn™t last, but at 
that mo me nt in my life I spoke three languages.  

Q: How long did you think, you and your fa mily, that you would be in Cuba? 

A: Oh, we just thought it would be about six mont
hs, but then it turned out that we had a longer 

wait and we didn™t get in til a year and a half late
r. And we were in this country, in America, 
must have been at the beginni
ng of 19 -- at least the mi ddle of 1941, cause we moved to Miami, 
and then my  father and my mother moved to Sa
int Louis for six months. They thought they could 
earn -- he could earn a better living up there. Bu
t that only lasted six months, then we moved 
back. But we have letters from my grandparents 
and my aunt  who stayed in Poland addressed to 
us in 1941 in America, to -- in Saint Louis. 

Q: Tell me about your arrival in
 Cuba. What was that like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
11 
 
A: We arrived in Cuba. Battista was very good to
 the Jewish people. Seems like Cubans didn™t 
have any feelings of anti-Semitism. They did put us in a camp. Not a concentration camp, but a 
camp to hold us until we could get settled in the 
country, and treated us ve ry nicely. There was 
food morning, noon and night and they treated us to
 something that was th
eir delicacy, but we 
didn™t like it, was fried bananas. And we stayed 
there a few days and my Uncle Jassie, the one 
who signed the papers, he was living in Detroit, 
and I understand now he sent money to us every 
month, to mine -- all three families, so that we 
could survive in Cuba. The story I got fr om my 
father was that he imme diately went to work, 
which he did, and earned m
oney so that we could 
be supported. But he had help. But he did go to wo
rk, went to work on a bicycle in Cuba. Carried 
around the package that he wa
s selling from door to door. 
Q: What was he selling? 

A: Dry goods, clothing, wome n™s 
clothing, me n™s clothing. Anythi
ng you wanted, he would get. 
And I ma de friends with a Cuban fa mily who liv
ed -- we li -- got an apartment. It was around a 
courtyard like they have in Cuba so that the -- 
we were living indoor outd
oors, cause of the warm 
weather and made friends with a mother and 
a daughter. The mother was lovely to me . The 
daughter and I became very good friends. She ma de
 clothes for me  and her daughter, same  kind 
of dresses so we looked like sisters when we we
nt out. Very nice people, but I lost contact with 
them. We nt to Cuba, learned Spanish. We nt
 to school in Cuba, learned Spanish.  
Q: You said that you were going to Cuba, quote unquote, on vacation -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- or holiday, whatever, that™s
 what you told the German a ut
horities. Was there any problem 
with your staying with respect to the Cuban gove
rnme nt?  Did they give you any -- any hassles 
for st ayi ng? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
12 
 
A: No, they seemed to know that -- what the 
reason was and they allowed us to stay there 
without any hassles. In fact, some  
of the people on the ship that we
 ma de friends with stayed in 
Cuba until Ca stro came  in, because they began to ma ke a good life, right there. So that we had 
some  friends that stayed in Cuba. 

Q: Tell me  about starting school in
 Cuba and where you were in Cuba. 
A: Well, it was near my  apartmen
t because I -- I could walk to sc
hool. And of course it was very 
strange because I wasn™t speaking anything at al
l, I couldn™t understand 
anything that was going 
on, so I kept quiet. And then, after a couple of m
onths I was able to begin to speak a little. And 
the children were nice, you know, you could play
 on the playground without
 talking. And then I 
picked up some  words, and began to have some  fri
ends with them, especially that little girl who 

lived near the apartment. And she was in same  
class I was in, so we had friends in -- I had a 
friend in school and I had a frie
nd at home  besides my brother a
nd my cousins. We  we re always 
close, my brother Max, Manny and Jackie. They -- 
they rema ined in Miami, I moved up here to 
Baltimore. 
Q: Were you near a -- a city? 

A: We  were in Havana.  

Q: We re there any other ref
ugees in the school with you? 
A: Yes, there were three or four other children, 
who mi ght have been -- I -- I think they were on 
the boat with us, on the ship. And they had the sa
me  problems I did trying to learn to understand 
what the teacher is saying because they spoke 
only in Spanish. And some how we picked up the 
language, I think more fr om the children than from
 anything else. And then we were able to use 
our knowledge to get some  of thework done, but never as good as 
the children who were born in 
Cuba.

Q: In what ways was your life in Cuba what you 
had expected it would be and what ways was it 
very different? 
A: We ll, they didn™t seem to have any winter, 
it was warm al l the time, 
whereas in Germany, of 
course, it was a different kind of 
climate, we were cold in the winter and hot in the summer. And 
so we wore less clothing and Ba
tista, who was the dictator at 
the time, he was -- I think he 
thought of the Jews as a mi ddle class, because he  
didn™t give us any problems. If anything I think 
the Cuban governme nt helped us 
get settled into the apartment. 
And there were some  agencies 
that provided us with food at th
e beginning, until we got settled.  
Q: Aside from the refugees, people who perhaps came  on your  ship, were there other Jews 

around in Cuba? 

A: Yes, there were some  Jews in Cuba. They 
were of European extraction, though. Some  of the m 
had come  there earlier, 10 years earlier than 
we did and they had established themselves and 
were doing well economi cally, so that
 we did meet some of them.  
Q: Wa s there a -- any kind of Jewish commun
ity in your -- in your area of Havana? 
A: There was a Jewish community, small Jewi sh community, but I don™t reme mber going to 

synagogue, so I don™t know. We may have a
nd we ma y not, I just can™t reme mber. 
Q: What Jewish traditions could 
you continue to observe in Cuba? 
A: Oh, well my mother kept kosher, and we observe
d the Shabbas in --  in the apar tment, in the 
home , so that I couldn™t go out to play on sat -- 
I could go out to play, bu
t I couldn™t go to the 
movies or anything like 
that. So it was the food and observing the Sabbath. 
Q: What about holidays? 

A: We celebratedthem with my fa mily that 
came over. And we lived together. There were 
several apar tments in this complex and so we all 
lived near each other, because I would play in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
14 
 
my apartme nt and then run over to my c -- c -- to
 Ceeta and Uncle Ben™s apartment and to Esther 
and Herschel™s apartment. So we were very clos
e in that  it seemed almo
st open air like. I think 
the doors were kept open
 most of the time. 
Q: Was your mother able to ge
t kosher meat and other foods? 
A: As far as I know she was, so there must have been a kosher butcher shop. 
Q: While you were in Cuba, were you aware of 
what was going on with the S.S. Saint Louis? 
A: No, we did not know about the Saint Louis. I 
did not know about that until later on. Til I came  
to America and I -- til I got olde
r. As far as I knew -- as far as I was concerned everybody who 
wanted to come  could come  over. 

Q: So you never me t anybody who had been on the Saint Louis? 

A: No, I never did. 

Q: We ™re going to pause 
so I can change tapes. 
A: All right. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: -- the S.S. Saint Louis, and I wanted to cont
inue along that line. The 
other refugees that you 
me t, were they people who had just been on 
your ship, or did you meet anybody who had come  
in any other way? 

A: Some  of them were people we
 had ma de friends with on our ship and there was one fa mily 
we me t who had come  there in probably 1931 or ev
en earlier, and he had a s -- he and his family 
had established themselves. And their children we
re born in Cuba, so even though -- they were 
from Vienna, but he was a ma n 
who knew early on things were 
not good. So it must have been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
15 
 
like, ma ybe late 20™s. So we were friends with 
them. Other than that, I 
can™t reme mbe r  who else 
we were friends with. 
Q: So all the refugees that you knew, you knew from the ship? 

A: Right, yes. That™s right. 

Q: We re you able to get any religious education in Cuba? 

A: No. I don™t know if we tried, but my motherknew it would be hard for me  just to learn 

Spanish. And then, we were also trying to learna little English. So she didn™t put me  in Hebrew 

school at that time. 

Q: You me ntioned se veral time s that you were 
still ge tting letters from Europe. Can you be a 
little bit more specific and tell 
me  what was in the letters that
 you were receiving while you -- if 
you can reme mber, while you were in Cuba [indeciphe
rable] what you were hearing in those first 
months after [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, life was very hard for my grandparents in
 Poland and my aunt. They were very close to 
each other and they took care of each other. My 
gr andmother was always -- had always been sick 
and we were sending packages over to Poland and 
the censors would take out money and food so 
that finally when my grandparents got a pack
age, it had been opened up and only sma ll amount 
of what we sent was -- wa s there. They always 
talked about the fact th
at they weren™t hearing 
enough from my Uncle Beryl, who 
was established in Detroit, 
that he wa sn™t writing enough, 
whereas my -- Bertha and Esther and Ceeta, my mo
ther, my two aunts who were with us in Cuba 
wrote to Poland a lot and sent a lot of packages
 over there. And we heard from the m in 1939, 
1940, 1941. In 1942 they -- that stopped, we didn™t h
ear -- of course [inde
cipherable] already. 
Q: Were ther e any additional attemp
ts to get them out of Europe? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
16 
 
A: My grandparents didn™t want
 to co me to America. They 
we re afraid there would be no 
synagogues. They thought they were too -- they
 were probably my age which -- the age I am 
now, and yet they thought they were too old to 
travel across the ocean. 
I don™t know why -- well, 
Aunt Ella felt a very si -- as 
all of the sisters did, a very stro
ng connection to their parents and 
she stayed with them. So that
 was the reason, I think, that 
she didn™t come, cause she was 
devoted to her parents. 
Q: Where were you -- if you reme mb er the details
 -- where were you when you realized that the 
war had begun and Germany had attacked Poland? 

A: I -- when I was in Cuba we heard that Hitle
r had gone into Poland, which was a great deal of 
discussion in my household about what would 
be happening to the parents since Hitler was 
ma rching into Poland. And we were very worried fo
r them, c oncerned that 
they would lose their 

lives, which eventually they did, cause we never 
heard from them a fter 1942. So we were -- a lot 
of talk about what -- what could we do and 
it -- I don™t know, just seem
ed at that point we 
couldn™t do anything.  

Q: You heard about it in your home. Did 
you hear anything about the war in school? 

A: No. Oh, we had a radio, so I heard a lot of th
ings on the radio, we heard a lot of infor mation 
on the radio, but I don™t reme
mber discussing it in school. 

Q: Did your parents ever explai
n what was going on in Europe to
 you, or did you just hear them 
speaking with other adults? 

A: Mostly it was what I overheard th
em talking about with each other.  
Q: You me ntioned the letters that
 you were getting. Other than th
e letters, did you have any idea 
what was happening to the Jews in Europe? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
17 
 
A: Yes, when we -- of course, Esther knew, a
nd Bertha, my mother, that when we were in 
Germany, that things were happeni
ng to Jewish people, Jewish 
people we re being arrested, we 
saw that. My uncle was arrested, 
sent to a camp, and my, of c our
se, the teacher left. So we knew 
things were happening then. We  didn™t know the ex
tent of it. We didn™t know about the millions 
of people who were going to get kill
ed. We  just knew that Jews were
 in trouble, and so we had to 
get out, even though it was a terrific decision on th
eir part to leave the country that they had 
known and to move halfway around the world.  

Q: You also me ntioned that you heard about th
e war on the radio. Do you happen to reme mber 

the radio reports and if they were objective, or 
if there was some  kind of bias one way or the 
other? 

A: I don™t know, I just reme mber they saying th
at Hitler was ma rching into Poland and that 
things were terrible for the Jews and for the Po
lish people, because they 
were being, I believe, 
bombed by the planes. So that as far as I 
knew, it was an accurate account of what was 
happening. 

Q: At any time  during your st
ay in Cuba, did you personally 
experience any anti-Semitism?  
A: No, I didn™t. No, no anti-Semitism towards me . I don™t want to jump ahead, but in Miami I 

did. 

Q: Did anybody in Cuba ask you about your life in Germany?  

A: Yes, my -- the woma n and the daughter who we
 befriended. They wanted to know about our 
life in Germany and we told them we had -- had -- 
had to leave because of Hitler, as a result of 
the plans to put Jews into camps. We knew that, we 
just didn™t know that they were going to be 
gassed. Like you know, you go to a camp, ma ybe you 
get out. There were people -- my uncle 
says that he was taken from -- we
ll the night -- the morning of -- af
ter Kristallnacht, he was taken 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
18 
 
on a train, he and three others in a cattle car 
and they -- they were going over rivers, so they 
thought they were going to be dumpe d in the wa
ter. Then they were released on land -- not 
released, but taken out of the cattle car, and th
ey were on -- on safe ground, so they were happy 

just to be alive. They didn™t know if they w
ould live through that expe
rience of going -- then 
they were taken to a camp, and he had to stay 
ther e for awhile until my aunt -- Aunt Esther 
bribed the Gestapo to get him out. 

Q: Do you know what camp and do you know what the bribe was? 

A: The bribe was money, I don™t know the camp. 

Q: When you think back -- back about your 
time  in Cuba, what are some  of your happy 
me mo r i e s ?   

A: We ll, I reme mber walking by -- near Moro ca
stle, which is near the waterfront. And there 
were parks there, we would go play
 in the park, my mother and my 
aunt -- aunts, both of them. 
The three wo me n, who were sitting and studying Eng
lish so that when they got to this country 
they would -- and they had studied English in 
Germany so they would be able to speak when 
they got here. And my father and my uncles, they 
went out to work, so we would see them in the 
evening. I reme mber being out of doors, play
ing around the palm trees. That was a happy time 
with my co -- ma inly with my cousins and my br other.  

Q: Is there anything else that
 stands out in your mi nd about your -- your time  in Cuba?  
A: No, except that we were looking forward 
to leaving, even though it 
was a pleasant time in 
Cuba, we really were anxi
ous to get to America. 
Q: We re you too, you also were anxious to leave? 

A: Yes.  

Q: And altogether, howlong were you in Cuba? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
19 
 
A: About a year and a half. 
Q: And how did you ma nage to leave? 

A: We ll, the quota for Jews comi ng into America, 
we were then included in that quota, I don™t 
reme mber what the quota was. And we came to Mi
ami and Ceeta and Uncle Ben went to Detroit. 
I think we landed in -- in Miami by boat and we st
ayed in mi  -- in the Miami area, northwest 
section of Miami and Ceeta and Uncle Ben took a 
train and went to Detroit because her -- their 
brother was in Detroit and had esta
blished hims elf in business, he ran a five and 10 cent store. So 
that -- and that was where their uncle was, the ma
n who had provided us with the papers to come  
to America. If we couldn™t ma ke a living, he wa
s going to -- he was goi
ng to help us live.  

Q: Do you reme mber the trip from Cuba to Miami?  

A: No. For some  reason I can™t reme mber 
it. I just  reme mber comi ng to Miami. 
Q: Re me mb er your first impressions of Miami?  

A: We  got a house in the northwest section of Mi
ami and my mother and father and myself and 
my brother, my aunt and my uncle
 and my cousins lived together 
in a house. And they were very 
busy going away to work, and nobody had time to cut the grass. There was an old car in the 

driveway, we played cops and robbers there. A
nd it was a Christian area 
and the teachers were 
very religious, there was a lot of Jesus and Christ mas songs and there was some anti-Semitism 

from the children towards me . Some -- one of 
the boys gave me  sign of t he finger cause I was 
Jew girl. And that was in Miami.
 We stayedtherefor awhile 
and then moved to Miami  Beach, 
which was filled with Jewish people so we didn™
t have that  much anti-Semitism after I left  

Miami. 

Q: How long were you in Miami before you went to Miami Beach? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
20 
 
A: Let™s see. We  were probably in Miami for about
 two years. I reme mbe r  they put me back in 
the first grade, even though I was at this time a
bout nine, because that was the policy, that if you 
didn™t speak the langu
age, they put you back. Finally my 
mot her, who was quite retiring and shy, 
but she did go to school, she said, 
my daughter is nine years old, 
she really belongs in another 
grade. So they put me  up to third grade, and 
then I progressed from there. Lived in Miami for 
two years, then I went to -- we moved to Miami  Beach, lived in an apartment. We  li ved in an 

apartment there.  

Q: Let™s stay in Miami just a little bit. You were already in this country when a lot of things had 

been changed in the war. 

A: Right. Well, I was here when
 Pearl Harbor, when they dropped -- when the Japanese dropped 

the bomb on Pearl Harbor, so we were glad th
en that Roosevelt had America go into the war 
with the allies. That was a big turning point fo
r us, we felt that that was one way -- we even 

hoped that my grandparents and aunt  would surv
ive some how, because now
 the Americans were 
going to help us defeat Hitler. So was a joyous
 occasion when we learned that America was 
going into the war. 

Q: After Pearl Harbor, did you experience any anti
-foreign sentiment, or 
any increase in anti-
Semitic feelings? 

A: Oh let™s see. That would still be in Miami and it was some anti-Semitism fr  -- shown fr om the 

people, but there were organizations
 there also because they wanted
 to help us. My teacher asked 
me to come out into the hall a
nd she said would I would want a 
Thanksgiving basket. So I went 
home and asked my mother and my mother said
 no, we didn™t need it, we had enough meat of 
our own. But they were looking to help. They kne
w we were refugees, obviously. So there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
21 
 
people in Miami who were tryi ng to help us. Bu
t some of the children got -- were anti-Semitic 
and they got that from their parents.  
Q: Did any of the children ask you about your pr
evious experiences in Cuba or Germany? 
A: No, they didn™t.  

Q: When you were in Miami, were you 
and your relatives the only Jews around? 
A: Yes. Some how we got into a neighborhood that wa
s the -- so it was just
 the four -- the four 
adults and the four childre
n living together in the house and we we
re the only Jews in that area. It 
was northwest section of Miami which at the tim
e was a Christian area. There were Jews living 
in Miami, but not the area where -- where we
 got the house, where we rented the house.  
Q: While you™re in this rental house in Miami,
 what Jewish traditi
ons did you still retain? 
A: We  were able to keep up the tradition at hom
e, as we had done in Cuba. We  celebrated the 
holidays in the house. And since we had -- were 
fortunate enough to come out as a family -- we 
had the two fa milies and always celebrated t
ogether. Mostly it was Passover. Hanukah was not 
such a big deal as it is now. I don™t reme mber 
going to synagogue in Miami. Probably didn™t start 

that til Miami Beach, which 
was a few years later.  

Q: Were there any specific problems other th
an the ones that you me
ntioned, you know, learning 
the language and you know, being put back in 
school?  Did you have 
any other problems  
adjusting to life in the United States? 

A: We ll, I felt strange, different, because I was --
 wasn™t speaking English the way the other boys 
and girls were speaking, so I tended to keep quiet
 until I was talked to, and then I woul d answer 
haltingly, because at that time I really wasn™t co
nversant in English, I wa
s just learni ng a few 
words and phrases. So I felt s -- 
like a stranger 
in the Miami area. And that took probably the 
whole two years I was there.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
22 
 
Q: And how were the adults progressing with re spect to ma king a living and getting used to the 
culture and language? 

A: Interestingly enough my father and uncle we
nt out and went to the wholesale houses, got 
some  dry goods and started selli
ng it from house to house. They 
even had opened up a store in -- 
not too far from the house. But that didn™t work
 out, they couldn™t ma ke enough money on the 
store so they closed that. But 
they continued ma king a living going from house to house. And as 
I said my Granduncle Jassie had sent money in
 Cuba so that our income  at that time was 

supplemented by him. – We didn™t suffer too mu ch 
in Miami , I mean the -- we were able to -- 
to live fr om day to day until things got a little easi er. 

Q: Tell me about the move from mi a -- Miami to
 Miami Beach and how that affected your life. 
A: We ll we moved from the house to -- my father
 and my unc le didn™t get along too we ll living 
together. They had some  pretty 
bad fights living close quarters likethat  with the fa mily. Then we 
moved to Miami Beach and we each lived in sepa
rate apartments in separate apartment houses 
and that worked out. And there again my father 
and my uncl e  did the same  thing, they went out 
to -- well, they had connections already in 
the wholesale houses, bought -- then they bought a 
car, each of them had a car so they could drive around the greater Miami area, cause they went 

back to business in Miami, just a ride acro
ss the causeway. And I star
ted going to school in 
South Beach elementary school and things got eas
ier for me because I had learned the language. 

There was no anti-Semitism in Miami Beach becaus
e a lot of the people were Jewish. And there 
we did join a synagogue, Beth Jacob synagogue 
and I went to Hebrew school. And there we 
were able to live the Orthodox 
life that we had in Marktber
g, Germany. Going to synagogue on 
Saturday and my brother even le
d the children™s servic
e. He had learned th
e Hebrew well enough 
that he could do that. And we ma de friends in
 school, and the school was close -- the South 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
23 
 
Beach elementary school, the school was close 
enough to the apartment, we would just walk 
back and forth and see our friends in school
 and then play with them after school. 
Q: With the move, and now living 
in a community where there were more Jews, did any of these 
children ask you about your experi
ences in Germany or in Cuba? 
A: No, the children didn™t. The teachers did. They
 were interested in what I had expe rienced. 
And so I would tell them about it
, but the children weren™t intere
sted in my  background. And at 
that time I was able to communicate with them sothat I wasn™t --  I must have still spoken with 
an accent, but it di dn™t seem to af
fect the relationship I had with 
them, we were just friends. And 
they accepted me  as I was. And then 
we were all Jewish, so that helped. 
Q: What did the teachers ask you, 
and what did you answer them?  
A: Why -- well, they knew why I left Germany, how it was over in Germany, and I told them 

about Kristallnacht and having to
 leave Germany, having to leav
e my grandparents and they 
were very interested in that pa
rt of my life. Later on [indeciphera
ble] when I was in eighth grade 
I helped my parents -- I knew the language by then 
so well that  I helped my
 parents study for the 
citizenship, and -- I went over the questions wi
th them, which was hard for my father. My 
mother could do it. Questions, you know, about Am
erican history. But then, of course, I was 
learning -- at that point
 I was learning about American hi
story, and one of the teachers even 
asked me  to write a report on my experiences. So I 
did, and I read it to the 
class, and then on the 
intercom. An-And that way the children knew, b
ecause they wanted them to know what was 
going on over in Europe. But the children thems e lves
 weren™t that concerned about it. They were 
interested in surviving themselves. 

Q: After you read your paper, did -- nobody asked 
you anything?  None of the other children? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
24 
 
A: Yes, of course, after I read the paper on th
e intercom people came  up to me  and said, how 
long have you been here and what was it like. So 
then they did show interest. But the first step 
was the teacher asking me  to write
 about it, to talk about it. 
Q: At the time you were writing an
d reading your work, what was going on in the world at that 
point in time? 
A: Let™s see [indecipherable] the year. I think by 
then the war had ended, so that I was reliving 
some  of the history that people had gone thr
ough that these children and -- and these teachers 
didn™t have -- really weren't involved in very muc
h. I mean, luckily they were able to go on with 
their own life. Course there we
re young me n who were dying over 
there, but most of the people 
just went on with their life in -- in Miami B
each. There was no big concern except war bonds and 
some  rationing, things like that were going on. 
And in Miami Beach the soldiers were being 
trained for the American army, so we would h
ear them marching throug
h the streets of Miami 
Beach. That was during the war. So I must have
 written the composition towards the end of the 
war, 1945. And we did invite soldiers over to have 
Passover with us. So we were able to do that, 

to share whatever we -- my fath
er made, with other people.  
Q: During the war years, how cl
osely did you follow the news of what was happening in Europe? 
A: Again, it was through the ra
dio. We would sit -- all of us
 would sit around the radio and 
listen, especially when President Roosevelt talked, 
so that we could hear 
his fireside chats, and 
he would tell us about what was happening in 
the war. And the radio -- and the news, we would 
listen to the news, we were very mu ch con
cerned about what was happening in Europe, how 
Hitler was going through the European countries. We
 were very upset and concerned about that. 
All through the ray -- mostly thr
ough the radio, I don™t even reme mber the newspaper so much, 
just listening to the radio. Thatwas our connection with the world. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
25 
 
Q: Did you ever hear any anti-Semitic statements on the radio? 
A: No, I did not.  

Q: After you moved to Miami, did you have any c
ontact with any other re
fugees in Miami or 
Miami Beach? 

A: I -- no. There were -- no, the friend al -- I don™
t know if we ma de any friends in Miami those 
two years. It was all business and going to school
. In Miami Beach then we made friends with 
people who had lived in Miami Beach. They were
 not refugees, they were Americans, people 
who come  -- lived in America. 

Q: Wa s there anything about the way the Ameri
cans were responding to the war that surprised 
you? 

A: It was surprising that peopl
e here could go on so easily with
 their life when there was so 
much destruction going on over th
ere, going on with their lives here. But then in a way so did 
we. We  wer e  lucky and we started living. The on
ly connection we had was the letters to Poland 
and back. That™s what ma de us aware 
of how terrible things had progressed. 
Q: Do you reme mber any of th
e details of those letters? 
A: They were always happy to hear that we we
re doing well in America. 
Didn™t hear much from 
Uncle Beryl and der -- my mother™s brother was Ja
ssie, Uncle Jassie, di dn™t hear much from hi m. 
They -- we wrote that things we
re hard here to get started. Th
ey wrote back that everybody in 
America from Europe gets started as a shoesh
ine boy but then works themselves up into big 
business, so that it would -- sin
ce we had to travel halfway aro
und the world they said that we 
could -- that they figured we would do alright an
d we™re just lucky to be here. And they were 
getting along okay, day to day. Not enough food. If 
some body left a little bit of food over they 
told them, of course, as we did over here, eat 
it up because -- well there you didn't know if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
26 
 
were going to get any more food because things we
re being -- w-were r
eally tough in Poland. So 
they wrote about their hardships and they were 
always happy to hear from us, about the progress 
we were ma king. 
Q: Did you get the sense from those letters th
at they were holding back and not telling you 
everythi ng? 

A: Yes. Because they we re kind of -- some what
 happy that w -- they were getting along day to 
day, and I suppose not to worry us, not 
to worry my mother and my aunts. 
Q: What else stands out in your mi nd about thos
e years when you were in the United States and 
the United States was at war with Germany?  

A: We  were so worried about what was happening 
to the people in Poland. We  never really knew 
after 1942, so that was a constant worry about wh
at was happening to the parents, what was 
happening to my aunt. And that was a lot of th
e things that we were talking about around the 
table, concern for the relatives w
ho had -- couldn™t get out, or had decided not to get out and then 
at this point couldn™t get out.  

Q: Where were you when you found out the war was over? 

A: I was in Miami Beach and just [indecipherabl e]
. And at that point  then
 we started contacting 
the Red Cross, but they never 
could find out what happened to 
my parents -- my grandparents. 
Q: We re you at home when you heard about the 
end of the war, or were you at school? 
A: I believe I was at home . We wer e  jumpi
ng for joy. I reme mber hopping up and down, saying 
it™s ov -- finally over. And my mo
ther and -- my  father wasn
™t home -- my mother and my 
brother and I were hugging and kissing and happy th
at it was finally over,
 hopefully that we 
could be -- find some  of those re
latives who had left but who had 
not left with us, but we could 
never do that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
27 
 
Q: When did you begin to realize 
the full extent of the genocide? 
A: It was after the war that we started realizing 
that so ma ny people had died in the ovens that we 
were just astounded. I mean, we t
hought perhaps they™d be arrested
 and kept for a few years, but 
never that they -- anybody was put
 into the ovens and killed lik
e that. So it was about 1946 - 
1947 that we  began to realize 
the extent of what had been
 happening over there and how 
fortunate we had been to get away. 
Q: And how did you learn about all 
the -- the deaths over in Europe? 
A: When we  contacted the American Red Cross a
nd as far as I know they never could trace what 
happened to my fa mily, so we just assume
d that they died. We  don™t know exactly how. 
Q: Do you reme mber how the American me dia reported the news of the genocide? 

A: They -- they talked on the radio about Jews 
having been killed. I don™t reme mber that I -- I 
knew any numbers, like what you heard later on about
 six million Jews. I just knew that a lot of 
Jews were being killed.  
Q: We ™re going to pause 
so I can change tape. 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
28 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum volunteer collection 
interview with Ruth Alper. This is tape two, si
de A. And we were talking about how you came to 
realize the full extent of the genoc
ide, and I™d like to continue w
ith that. I had asked you how the 
news was being relayed to the American population. 
I™d like you to continue to speak about that. 
A: All right, we heard a lot of
 it on the radio and we did go to 
the movies and we would see the 
newsreels and see what had happene
d and it was horrifying to see th
e actual pictures of the cons 
-- concentration camp people who had been just down 
to a shell of a person. 
So that at  that point 
after the war, we realized more how horribl e 
and how horrific the whole thing had become . And 
we never did find out what happened to
 my grandparents and my Aunt Ella. 
Q: How did the American population sitting next
 to you watching the newsreel, how did they 
react to this news? 

A: They were also horrified when they sa
w what had happened. They were just -- it wa s 
unbelievable, the slaughter and the 
inhuma nity that had occurred. So
 a lot of the people that we 
were friends with -- and they were Jewish, but th
ey had been American Jews so they didn™t have 
to go through what we went through, but they just
 thought it was the wors
t thing that they had 
ever seen in their whole life and they™ll 
probably never see anything so horrendous again. 
Q: Did you ever get a sense from the  non-Jewish 
American population how 
they were reacting to 
this? 

A: They were -- they were also horrified, but it
 hadn™t affected them as badly because  ma ny of 
our Jewish friends had fa mily who had gone through some  of these times, so they were more 

inclined to feel the horror that had occurred, wh
ereas some  of our American friend who were not 
Jewish heard about it, but it wasn
™t as hurtful as it was to us.

Q: Did any of your loved ones or former ne ighbors or friends, any of them survive? 
A: Well, the fr iends that  we saw in Belgium, who left  the Oronoco in Belgium, we never hear d 

from the m again, so as fa r as we know they were
 sent back to Germany a nd died there. I don™t 
know of any survi
vors after that.  
Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials? 

A: Yes, I felt that  it was important for those Na
zis who had incurred this 
wrath on us that they 
should be punished for what they had done. So that
 I felt the Nuremberg tr
ials were justified and 
I felt that they were something that brought it
 home  more to Americans than we had known 
before. 

Q: Did you feel there was 
justice at Nuremberg? 
A: Yes, I did. 

Q: Did you follow the debate on 
the partition of Palestine? 
A: Yes. We  were very anxious that those Jewi
sh people who were trying to get into Palestine 
were having problems on the ships, so that we could identify with that because we ha d been on a 

ship also. Luckily we were able to get off the 
ship, but we were really
 concerned that those 
people who were leaving a Holocaust
 area would again meet such de
termination not to be able to 
come  into a country where they mi ght be able 
to have some  freedom of e xpression and perhaps 
no anti-Semitism because  it was ga -- we were 
hoping that  it would become a Jewish state. 
Q: Have you ever considered moving, you or your pa
rents, your fa mily, ever considered moving 
to Palestine? 

A: No, and we had my Uncle Be
n™s fa mily, who had go -- his brot
her had gone to Palestine early 
on, before Ben. Ben said he never considered goi
ng there because he had a -- he was a tailor and 
he was working in Germany, he didn™t see any re
ason to get out. That was in the early 1930™s, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129

then later on when we all left , well that was -- 
he was imprisoned. There we
nt the -- his income  
and whatever there ha -- whatev
er reason he had for staying in
 Germany was absolutely gone.  
Q: Do you reme mber the Eichma nn trial? 
A: Yes, I do. And I felt the Israelis were right to
 convict Eichma nn of thes
e terrible crimes that 
had been committed against humanity. I felt that 
he had gotten what he deserved, even though 
they were all saying they were just following 
orders, there is a time when people have to 
consider that they are murdering wome n a
nd children and me n who had no other reason for 
being killed except for the fact
 that  they were Jewi sh. 
Q: Can you recall the reaction of 
some  of the Americans around you to
 some  of these events like 
the Nuremb erg trials and [i nd
ecipherable] and then even 
the nur -- the Eichma nn trial 
[indecipherable] in Amer ican me dia. If you -- if you could kind of tell me  how it was presented 

and how it was received by the American public? 

A: We ll, the people that I knew felt that these tria
ls were justified because they had also heard 
about the horrors that had gone on so that they felt
 that these trials were 
necessary, that the state 
Israel was necessary and they even felt that if
 it hadn™t been for the Holocaust there mi ght not 
have been a state of Israel. But people were feel
ing so guilty about what 
had happened that it was 
time that the Jews were able to develop a homeland of their own so that if God forbid this ever 

happened again, perhaps then people 
would go to Israel to be some what safe. And the people that 
I knew felt that the Germans needed to be executed themselves as a result of what they had done 

during the war. 

Q: The Eichmann trial came in the early 60™s. Wa
s there any sense that you could detect from 
Americans that perhaps the war is over [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
31 
 
A: I detected that with some  of the -- th-the
y™re trying to get some  
Nazis who are living in 
Argentina and in South America. So I have ha 
-- I got that sense from 
some of the Americans 
that I knew that it was old hist
ory, these are old me n, they shoul
dn™t be bothered any more. But 
we felt that it had to be because they had lived
 through that time  and they knew exactly what was 
going on. They all knew. 
Q: Tell me  about the education that you were 
ultimately able to get in the United States. 
A: Well, I went to South Beach elementary schoo
l. Then Ivan Fisher Juni or  High and then my 
senior high school. Then I went to University 
of Miami where I me t my husband, who was born 
in Manhattan, New Yor k. And I got my Bachelor™s
 degree there. And we got ma rried, lived in 
Miami for awhile, then my husband got a j
ob in Towson, Maryland and taught at Towson 
University, which is a suburb of Baltimore, and 
I moved with him. I had taught in Miami, I 
taught elementary sc hool in Miami. I took off for 
about seven years to raise my children til they 
went to second and third grade and then I went ba
ck to school, taught scho
ol in Baltimore, got a 
Master™s and credits beyond that. 

Q: Where did you get yo
ur Master™s degree? 
A: Towson University. 

Q: And how ma ny children do you have? 

A: I have two children, a boy and a girl. They™re
 both ma rried and they have two children, boy 
and a girl. 

Q: What did you tell your ch
ildren about your childhood? 
A: I told them that I had been in Germany, and my
 trip to Cuba. The one who is very interested 
in this now is Rebecca, the 11 year ol d granddau
ghter, who goes to Hebrew school in Potoma c, 
Maryland and they™re doing a good jo
b there about educating thechildren on the Holocaust. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
32 
 
she -- and she interviewed 
me just two days ago, also had a li
st of questions for me . And then I 
gave her one of the sterling silv
er pieces of sterling that my
 mother had brought over so she 
could bring it to Hebrew school
 and share with the class.  
Q: In what ways do you think your
 experiences in your childhood ha
ve affected the way that you 
raised your own children? 
A: I wa -- we ll, on a personal point of view, mymother was ahead of her time  in that she knew 

psychology before psychology was in -- she felt th
at positive reinforcement was very important 
in bringing up children. So my brot
her and I both feel confident a
bout ourselves, and I tried to do 
that for my children. So that™s a personal point  
of view, that I brought them up in a positive way. 
They did know my history as they we re growing 
up, I never hid that. I did feel that I didn™t suffer 
as much as my mother and my aunts, but I 
told them about what ha -- about my bac kground. 
Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences? 

A: No, I have not done that.  
Q: Have you ever been interviewed before? 
A: No, I haven™t. 

Q: Why are you willing to do an interview now? 

A: I was persuaded by Amy Rubin at the Holocaust 
Museum. I explained to her that I didn™t feel 
that I had suffered like other people. I wasn™t 
sure that my story was as important, and Amy 
Rubin said that that  was -- it was a legitimate reason for being interviewed. 

Q: Do you belong to any survivor groups? 

A: No. 

Q: Have you ever returned to Germany? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
33 
 
A: I did return to Germany, but I didn™t go back to
 Marktberg. I went on a trip to s -- to hear 
opera and to see some  of the ot
her coun -- parts of the country. 
I did feel uncomfortable with 
people my age because I always wondered, 
what were you doing during the war, you know?  

Who was putting us to the prisons an
d the camps and all that horror. 
Q: How did the Germans react to you? 

A: I -- I didn™t tell them about my pas t , so as fa
r as they were concerne
d, I was just a tourist. 
Q: What have we not discussed in this interview 
that you would still like to
 -- to talk about with 
respect to your experiences as a result of the war? 

A: Well, the important thing was the trip over fr
om Ger many to Cuba, the 
fact that Aunt Ceeta 
lost her baby, never told her boys
 who were born in America that 
they had a brother. The fact 
that my mot her never got over th
e fact that she had to say goodbye to her mother and father on 
the dock at Ha mburg. She always ha
d that in the back of her mi nd 
and as a result of that, she had 
some  me ntal problems. Esther did not, her sister. 
I think it was as a result of that but ma ybe she 
would have had it anyway, but it 
-- you know, she was just devast
ated and felt guilty that she 
left, went on with her life and 
left her mother and father to die in Poland. And then my Aunt 
Ceeta we -- on her tape she said that she couldn't 
talk about it either, going over it, so she said, 
and we said -- and we parted, is what she said. 
So the loss of my grandparents and my aunt and 
uncle ar e the things th
at I feel the mo st.  
Q: Is there anything about you and your experien
ce that your fa mily and 
friends don™t know that 
you would perhaps like them to know? 

A: We , over the years have ma de ma ny friends w
ith people who are not Jewish, especially the 
professors at Towson University. There were on
ly a few Jewish. So once I -- we became friends 
on an intellectual and a social ba
sis, I would bring up the fact, nu
mber one, that I was Jewish, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0129  
34 
 
that they could see that Jewish people are pe
ople of quality also, and 
then I would tell -- oh, I 
reme mber sitting -- I wou -- when I taught school 
at Franklin elementary school, which was in 
northern Baltimore county, sitting around the tabl
e and talking about my 
Aunt Ceeta losing the 
baby. And these were people who did not know t
oo ma ny Jewish people, there was an area at 
that time who didn™t have Jewi
sh people there. And everybody around the faculty table just 
stopped and listened. And I felt I wanted them to know
 that was me , so they could have a little 
understanding of what some  people had gone through. 

Q: Is there anything else you™d lik
e to add before we conclude? 
A: We ll now that we™ve done the 
interview I™m glad I was interv
iewed and I hope this helps to 
keep the hi story of the Holocaust  alive so that  it will never happen again. 

Q: We ll, thank you for doing the in
terview today, and this concl
udes the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Ruth Alper. Thank you.
