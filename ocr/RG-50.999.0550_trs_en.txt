(Applause)
 
Frank, thanks som uch for joining usandf or your willin gness to be our
 F
i rs t  
Person
 
today. W eareglad to have you andwe don't have a lotof  tim e so we should 
probably start right away.  Just onehour. Frank, you said your earlier m emories start in 

1934 when you weref ive years old.  You also said of that tim e, all inall
 -- 
quote, all in 

3 
 
all, it was a good tim efor your parents. T ell us wh y that was so andwhat you can about 
your f am ily and your life in Gleiwitz bef ore Hitler really cam e to power and things turned 

so much worse.  
 
Frank LIeberm ann: Gleiwitz is
 
actually betwe en Opole, or Opeln,and Beuthen. 
My m other'sf am ily cam e from Opeln, andmy f ather'sf am ily cam efrom  Beuthen, and 

Gleiwit z was kind of  in the middle.  I usually li ke tom ention three things happened in 

1933 which were signif icant. One is m y grandparents celebrated the hundredth 

anniversary of  their wholesalebusiness.
 
Bill Benson: That's remarkable, 100 years.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yeah.  That they lived in
 
--
 
in that city.  Also, we boughta 
car, m y m otherandf ather bought a car, was sm aller thanthe Beatle, so that we could 

visit because where we lived didn't requireacar. T here were streetcars.  We lived on 

them ain street. T here was a streetcar goingto the hospital.  Everything was 

p ra c t ic a lly
 
--
 
the town was about100,000 people. Virtually everythi ng was within 
walkin g distance.  Andcars were quite a luxury.  T hat's about the time of the ModelA 

Ford was popular.  I was able to get around quite easily. W efelt safe.  And we had a 

lo vin g f a m ily.
 
Bill Benson:  You mentioned there were three thi
n gs .
 
Frank Liebermann: T he thirdof  course was Hitler.
 
Bill Benson:  Hitler com ing topower.  A bit more before we go tothe events that 
followed.  As you said,you have anearly m em ory of  your parents having a car, which 

was a luxur y.  As I remem ber you telling me,your m other's brothers drove motorcycles, 

which was also probably f airly unusual.
 
Frank Liebermann:  And m y grandmother never slept.
 
Bill Benson:  Never slept.
 
( Laughter ) 
 
W hen yourf atherm arried your mother, he was already prof essionally 
established.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson: Tell us a little bitabout that.
 
Frank Liebermann:  He studiedm edicine andtookhis residency f rom  a doctor in 
Breslau who was quite helpful because he had patientsf rom  Gleiwitz which he really 

didn't want to handle. So he kind of  inheritedthe recomm endation and got settled pretty 

quickl y in the town.  That was also oneof  thereasons why he picked Gleiwit z. 
 
Bill Benson: Thank you.  As you mentioned,Hitler cam e topower in 1933.  You 
started school in 1935, attending a public school.  And youtoldm e that recess was the 

m ostdangerous tim efor you. W ill you say more about that? 
 
Frank Liebermann:  Recess area was separated between boys andgirls and we 
were obviously identified as a group and basically being in a groupwas the most 

dangerous because you could be identif ied. And we triedtousually stay in the m iddle 

between theboy and the girl area where there were som e teachersthattried to protect 

us. W e were advised
 
--
 
we started pretty m uch on
 
time at the school, we had three 
room s within apublic school,but in leaving, where again you went en masse, we 

usually got out f ive m inutes early that we can get out of  the grounds and be on our way 

home bef ore anybody else could.
 
B ill B e n s on :  S o  let  t
he Jewish students out f ive m inutes early.
 

4 
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson:  Frank, that was 1935. Thenext year, 1936, circum stancesfor your 
parents and fam ily turned m ore om inous and becam e m ore diff icult, if  not dangerous.  
T ell us what changed in
 
1936, a signif icant year.
 
Frank Liebermann: T here was war in the east calledthe Crim eanW ar in 1920, 
ended I think July 1921 that led to establish
 
--
 
the establishm ent of  Poland which 
changed certain borders and Gleiwit z was right at the border. Inorder tom ake it
 
--
 
in  
order to let theGermans and Polandsf ind the places where they wouldbe comfortable 

and where they couldm ove, there was partof the peacetreaty required that therebeno 

discrim ination against either Germ ans or Polands on either side
 
of  the border andthat 
expired in 1936.  And that's when we lef tthecountry for
 
--
 
during that time,not knowing 
what would happen.  And when we cam eback,f or instance, there were brown shirts in 

f ront of the apartm enthouse where m yf ather also hadhis
 
off ice who threatened people 
who cam eto seehim with loss of jobsand all kinds of things.  He also lost his hospital 

privi leges so that we knew we had to getout.
 
Bill Benson: Before we go there, Frank, what you said you left the country, 
where did you
 
go in 1936?
 
Frank Liebermann: T o an island called Bornholm . It was a Danish island in the 
Baltic.  AndI went back to visit it in the 1980s.  Pretty muchthe same as it was kind of a 

unique culture. And com ing back we had
 
--
 
Bill Benson: And youweren't gone all that long.
 
Frank Liebermann:  No.
 
Bill Benson: And it changed that much in
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes, basically. W e had
-
posters
 
--
 
we had posters of  " Der 
Stürmer,"  which was the anti
-
Sem iticm agazine or newspaper.  It was at virtually ever y 
s
treet corner.  It showed theseugly cartoon pictures and theatm osphere just changed 

com pletely, almost overnight.  You probably see part of this in the exhibit which we have 

right now which is " Som e W ere Neighbors." But it was unique in that area near Po
land 

because inmost cases it
 
--
 
it was m ore gradual between 1933and 1936.
 
Bill Benson: W hereasin your case
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann: T his was over a weekend.
 
Bill Benson:  Right. So a law protecting against discrim inationexpired and things 
changed imm ediately, im mediately.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson: In1936, if I remember correctly, your m other went toIsrael. T ellus 
about that.
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, that
 
--
 
she went with herbrother and they learned at 
thattim e that there was one doctor 
f or every 100 people.
 
Bill Benson: In Palestine Israel.
 
Frank Liebermann:  InIsrael.  Because ithad
 
--
 
the sam ething the loss of  
hospital privileges and theblockading had happenedtoa lotof people before that.  So 

we
 
--
 
it hit us relatively late, butthat's when we decidedthat Israel was not an option 
and we had to look elsewhere.  And we fortunately, it turnedout that we f ound the 

United States.
 
Bill Benson: And it wasn't an optionbecause he couldn't have really m ad
e a 
living doing his prof ession.
 

5 
 
Frank Liebermann:  Exactly.
 
Bill Benson: Before we talkabout yourf ather com ing to the UnitedStates, you've 
looked at
 
--
 
you've been able to look at the, what you call the downhill slide of  your 
grandparents' business.  T his businessthat you'dhad in thefam ily for a century.  Tell 
us a little bitabout that. 
 
Frank Liebermann: T hey had a non
-
Jewish bookkeeper who kept the records 
and contactedm y parents afterW orldW ar II that they m ight be interested in it. It 

showe
d that their value between
 
--
 
in 1933 was 100,000m arks. You can't com pare that 
to anything today because of inf lationand soforth. By 1938 when the business was 

conf iscated, it was down to 20,000. 
 
Bill Benson:  So 80% drop.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.  Basically due toblockades. T he windows would be 
m arked in red regularly "Uda"  (phonetic) whic h means don't patronize. 
 
Bill Benson: W hen yourf ather losthis adm itting privileges and losthis practice, 
how did he make ends m eet for the f am ily?
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, basically f rom  whatever savings they had.  I think my 
grandparents were established and they helped out. And we started looking. 
 
Bill Benson:  Youf ound
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann:  By the way, also 1936, bank accounts weref rozen.  That 
m eans if  youhad money in thebank, you could only withdraw enough of  what the Nazis 

determ ined that youneeded in order to survive. T heref ore, you really couldn't use your 

m oney to leave the country.  If  you left, youwere allowed to take ten marks, which was 

not
hing, m aybe.  By today's standard, $50.
 
Bill Benson: $50. That's what you were allowed to take with you.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
Bill Benson:  You shared with m e that yourf am ily did not keep a kosher kitchen 
but youonly purchased at kosher butchers
.  W hy wa s tha t?
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, Gleiwitz was about120,000 people. T he Jewish 
population was about1,000 fam ilies.T heonly wa y a kosher butcher could survive is 

ever ybody boughtf rom him  because if only those people who wanted kosher meat, the
y 

wouldn't beable to get it.  He couldn't survive  on it.  So everybody had a sense of 

comm unity.
 
Bill Benson:  Frank, Israel wasn't an optionand so youbegan to look elsewhere 
toward the UnitedStates.  In 1938 your father m ade a trip to the US that would make it 

possiblefor him  to move to the US later thatyear.  T ellus about his trip in January of  

1938 and then the events that led up to hisdeparture. W hatm ade it possiblef orhim to 

do that?
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, f irst of all, m y grandf ather,m y 
m other's f ather, had a 
hobby of genealogy and he traced thefam ily back to about 1700.  Hef ound two people 

who im m igratedto theUnited States.  Onehad married MichaelGratz who moved to 

Philadelphia, I think som ewhere in theearly 1700s, around1730 or 1740.  And were 

quite active, infact during the revolution and they
 
--
 
the f am ily also founded Gratz 
College in Philadelphia.  So he
 
--
 
oneof  theplaces he went to were the archives in 
Philadelphia wherehe found thatthe daughter, Rebecca Gratz, who by the way was the 

heroine in Ivanhoe, never m arried and therefore had no survivors.  Her brother m oved 

west, which was Louisvil le, Kentucky.
 

6 
 
Bill Benson:  The f rontier.
 
Frank Liebermann: T he f rontier.  Andall records were lost so that was not an 
option.  T
he second option was reluctantly taken that in 1905
 
a  s on
-
in
-
law of m y great 
grandfather asked to borrow $3,000, which was a very large am ount.  Adollar was I 
think threem arks in those days.  And he said heneeded itf ora week and he used it to 

com e tothe United States and was really notheardf rom.  My father did see him .  He 

haddone very well in the United States.  Hewas vice president of Bendix Aviation 

which was oneof  theprem iere companies.
 
Bill Benson: So yourfather saw him  when he cam e in January of  1938.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.  And he did get an aff idavit which had to state
 
--
 
the 
United States hada quota of  25,000peoplefor Germ any.  And you will to have an 

aff idavit thatf rom  somebody in the UnitedStates who would prom ise that we w
ouldn't 
be on welf are.  Otherwise, if  you showed thatyou had$5,000 you could also com e to 

the UnitedStates. But that wasn't possible wi thf rozen bankaccounts.  So he did come 

back with anaff idavit and we got anum ber
 
--
 
a quota num berf rom  the United
 
States.
 
Bill Benson: So you
 
--
 
you'd get a quota number, and there'sa lim ited number of 
those, and then you get anaff idavit saying that somebody wil l be responsiblef or you.
 
Frank Liebermann: W ith an aff idavit, you could get a quotanum ber.
 
B ill B e n s o
n: Sonow you have the quotanumber, okay.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.  This was in January.  And nothing happened. By 
beginning of  March, he calledaf riend who said
 
--
 
and said look, the council has a 
secretary called Fraulein Schm idt.  I suggest senda nice box of  candy.
 
(Laughter)
 
W hich he did.  And another m onth passed.
 
Bill Benson:  Nothing happened.
 
Frank Liebermann:  And nothing happened. Andhe called thef riend and said, 
you know, I'm  getting
 
--
 
I'm  really getting anxious. Things are getting worse.  He said 
well, did you put 100marks into it?  Intothe box?  And so he never thoughtof  that or
 
--
 
I 
m ean, that wasn't done.  He sent another box of  candy, this tim e with 100marks,and 

shortly af ter
 
we got notice to come to Berlinfor a physical exam  at the Am erican 
Em bassy. W e got our Visa on I think theendof  June,and he took the next
 
--
 
th at wa s 
goodf or120 days.  Since nom oney couldbe takenout, there was a possibility of  

ge ttin g
 
--
 
if  you took afirst class ticket on a Germ an boat, you were able to geta pretty 
good spending allowance for theboat, whichcould then be transferred.
 
Bill Benson: Butonly if it was a Germanboat.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Only if  it was a Germ anboat.  Som y f ather 
took the next 
boat and we booked my m other and me f or October because the Visa was good f or 120 

days andagain, he was studying for the state boards in order to practice in Ohio.
 
Bill Benson: Before we go there, Frank, when your father got hisVisa, he wa
s 
paida visit by the Gestapo right after that. T ell us aboutthat.
 
Frank Liebermann: T he way you get space
 
--
 
rent spacefor stability you 
basically gi ve the landlord am ortgage. Andwhen he establishedhis practice, which 

was 1928,he gotthe apartment with the helpof m y grandfather, hegave a mortgage to 

a landlord,and as long as the landlordhad the mortgage, you basically could stay there.  

W hen he realized thatwe were m oving, he canceled his lease andaskedfor the money 

to be transferred to his
 
bank account, which by the way was f rozen. It couldn'tbe taken 

7 
 
out.
 
T he next day the Gestapo came and said we got
 
--
 
you're underarrest.  He said 
for what?  Said you withdrew a substantial am ountof m oney f rom
 
--
 
f rom  a certain bank 
which was the landlord's bank, and that's against the law.  Sohe called thebank, his 
bank, and the president of thebank did assure the Gestapo thatthem oney wasn't 

withdra wn but was transferred to thef rozenaccount.
 
Bill Benson: And he couldn't touch it
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann:  And correct. And they left. 
 
Bill Benson: And that allowed him  then to continue
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann: T hat allowed him  to
 
--
 
that allowed him to leave.
 
Bill Benson: Sohe goes to the US in June. Your Visas allow you to leave until 
October of  19
38 .
 
Frank Liebermann:  October.
 
Bill Benson: Tell us about that period of timewhere now it's just you and your 
m om , yourf ather'snow gone to the United States, things are very t ense. T ell usabout 

th a t tim e. 
 
Frank Liebermann:  My m other closedup the household. The car went to the 
(inaudible) who's one of the people who def inedthe brown shirts and went to see m y 

fa the r.
 
Bill Benson:  For care?
 
Frank Liebermann:  For care. T henat thattim e we could still takewith us any 
furnitureor belongings that
 
--
 
providing we pay the 100% tax.  And it had tobeused.
 
Bill Benson: So just
 
--
 
I want to stay on thatpoint for am inute. Youcould take 
your belongings butpaid a 100%of  the valueof  it ina tax.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.
 
F ra n
k Liebermann:  And that could
 
--
 
since we have nothing
 
--
 
no access tothe 
m oney, that could be done.
 
B ill B e n s on :   Righ t .  
 
Frank Liebermann:  She also bought them ost up
-
to
-
date Singer sewing m achine 
so that in case we didn't have money to buy clothes, she could sew. Andbasically 

closedup thehousehold.  During this tim e, I had
 
--
 
I wasf oolish enough to play tag and 
brokem y arm ,and m y m other called upf oran orthopedist atthe hospital whom she 

knew, andhe said sorry, I don'ttreat Jews.  Don't come
 
--
 
don't bring him . She 
c a lle d
 
--
 
f rantically call ed various other people, and including an orthopedist at my
 
--
 
the 
town where m y f atherhad grown up,Beuthen who said look, takea taxi to the back 

door of the
 
--
 
delivery door of the Catholic orphanage inBeuthen. I'll m eet you there.  
And he brought with him
 
--
 
I saw him , I cam eout with a plaster castand instructionsf or 
m y local pediatrician on what exercise todo in orderto getthe movem entbackand 

stretch it.  Now m y left arm  bends a little bitmore thanm y right arm , he did such a good 

job.
 
Bill Benson: Butthat's what you had to gothrough to get your arm taken care of.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson: As a littleboy. W hatelse happenedduring that tim e,those four 
m onths while you were
 
waiting f or your opportunity to
 
--
 
to takethis ship to join your 
fa the r?
 

8 
 
Frank Liebermann: W e
 
--
 
we got f rantic telegram s, takeanearlier boat.
 
Bill Benson:  From  your dad.
 
Frank Liebermann: T his was in Septem ber. And couldn't,by the way, because 
sp
ace was taken.W edidn't know wh y.  Remem ber, censorship was complete.  T here 
was no Internet.  It was a capital offense to listen toforeign broadcasts.  All newspapers 
were totally censored. Andmail was censored.  So we waited, not knowing what was 

go
ing on. W efound out what happened when we f inally got on theboat, which, by the 
wa y, wasn't in port when we were supposedto sail.
 
Bill Benson: And youwere very close to theendof  your Visa period, too, right?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.  
 
B ill B e n s on :   
So you get there,and there's no
 
--
 
your ship is not there.  
 
Frank Liebermann: T he ship isnot there. But we were told that we
 
--
 
th a t it 
would arri ve thenext day. W hat hadhappened during that time was Munich.  The 

infamous conferencewhere the prim e
 
m inister of  France, Daladier,theprim em inister of  
England, Neville Chamberlain, gave Hitler perm ission tom arch intoCzechoslovakia 

without their consent. And basically elim inated 14 divisions of  Germany's underbelly 

and changed the balance of power in
 
Europefor what was called Peace inourT ime by 
Nevil le Chamberlain.  T hat lastedabouta year.
 
Bill Benson: W orldW ar II began thef ollowing year.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
Bill Benson: So there you are atBrem erhaven, the ship wasn't there, but you 
have m ore to tell usabout why the ship wasn't there.
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, partof  Munich was that Hitler calledbackall ships at 
sea to threaten war in earnest.  Andthe ship lostf our days doing that, during the 

conf erence.  And they could
 
--
 
i t  c ou
ldm akeup onetrip a week, rather one day on each 
week because it was six sailing days and it alwa ys lef ton the sameday.  So we got the 

details when we got on the ship.
 
Bill Benson:  Found out what had happened?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson: Sonow you're safe, you'reon the ship, you're on yourwa y. W hat 
do you rem em ber about your journey totheUnited States?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Itwas during hurricane season in October.  My m other never 
left the cabin. Partly due to exhaustionand seasickness.  At one point, Ihad a private 

table in thef irst class dining room becausethere were only six people.  T hey sat at 

th e
 
--
 
the captain's table while I had m y own seat segregated. I didn't know wh y, but I 
don't get seasick so ...
 
Bill Benson:  You made 
that part of it o ka y.
 

Frank Liebermann:  Yeah.  And infact,I hadm y entertainment on that trip was to 
be
 
--
 
I have toadd, we hadthe cheapestf irstclass ticket, which was ver y m uch in the 
f ront of the ship. And I spent a lot of time watching thebow literally dive into a wave 

andthen gradually com eup and when it hit the water line, kindof  jerked up. T hat's how 

we slept atnight.  It was like going up anddown in an elevator.
 
Bill Benson:  Frank, ifI rem em ber right, youm entioned youhad the f irst 
cla ss 
ticket. That was important because that increasedthe spending allowance that you 

had.
 
Frank Liebermann: W e lived on that.
 

9 
 
Bill Benson: That's what you
 
--
 
that's them oney you would have to live on, by 
doing that.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
B ill 
Benson: So youarri ved in the United States.  Yourfather is in Ohio. T ell us 
about what it was like to reunite with your father, and what hadhappened to him if  that 
t im e .
 
Frank Liebermann:  Oh, he picked
 
--
 
hepicked us up. W e stayed rather in
 
--
 
I 
go
t a sightseeing tourof New York on the doubledecker Fif th Avenue busforf ive cents. 
It went up FifthAvenue and CentralPark,up to upper Manhattan and Im ean, we stayed 

two nights andthen left for Cleveland. 
 
W ebrought theVisa giver a big cr ystal ashtray as a token of thankswhich my 
m other hadand went back to Cleveland where m yf atherf inished studying f or the state 

boards, which he wasscheduled to take in December.
 
Bill Benson: So yourfather, whohad had his own establishedm edical practice i
n 
Germ any now in Ohiohe has to go back to schoolbasically to preparef or taking anew 

set of boards to become qualif ied
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, look,I'm  grateful that the education system  sees to it 
th
at we're well taken care of, that at least that theeducation is par.
 
Bill Benson: Sooncehe got his appropriatecredentialing and licensing, what 
happened then? 
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, we m oved to Dayton because Dayton didnothave a 
Jewish ear, nose,
 
throat surgeon and we wer e
 
--
 
we were persuaded by a fraternity 
brotherof m y father's to go to Dayton because he shared an officewith an ear,nose, 

throat surgeonand wanted to get usoutof  town.  It turned out to have beena very good 

decision.  Af ter
 
a few bum ps.
 
Bill Benson: Tell us about some of thosebumps.
 
Frank Liebermann:  He opened his office in Dayton
 
--
 
on Valentine's Day, 
February 14, 1939, and imm ediately asked f or
 
--
 
f iled to join them edical society which 
was at that time a signof legitim acy that you're properly qualif ied. Right af terhef iled

hisapplication,they called an em ergency m eeting on Friday night, which by the 
wa y is a Jewish Sabbath, andpassed a law requiring citi zenship inorder to become a 

m em ber.  Now I have to s
peak
 
--
 
that law passed by 51
-
49,and becam e part of  their 
rules.
 
Bill Benson: Therefore denying your f ather
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann:  Correct.
 
B ill B e n s on :   
--
 
hism em bership in themedical society.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Now I'd like to speak to the wonderf ul institutionof  the United 
States press.  Somebody had called
 
--
 
Saturday m orning he got a call in theoff icef rom  
a reporterf rom  the" Dayton Herald."  He said, Doctor, could I com eto see youf or af ew 

m inutes? He said certainly.  He spent half  an hour,anhour, lookingat his credential, 

asking him abouthis education and said thank you ver y m uchand said good
-
bye.  The 
next m orning the" Dayton Herald"  hadaneditorial, Freedom of Opportunity in the United 

States, telling what happened, and thefollowing Monday hehad 11new patients and 

basically that established hispractice.  One of m yf avorite sayings is  if  you get a lem on, 

10
 
 
m a k e l em o na d e.  
 
Bill Benson:  Frank, I want to go back a little bit afew m onths. Soonaf ter you 
arrived.  It's Novem ber 9, 10.  You're in Cleveland still, I believe.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson: And you're athom e. T ell us what happened on thenight of 
Kristallnacht and
 
--
 
Frank Liebermann: T hat was probably the longest hour of m y lif e.  I believe it 
was aW ednesday, wh en the m ovie theater had a specialI think 10
 
cents for the 
m o vi e
 
--
 
rem em ber inf lation, that was the equivalent of m aybe $1.50 or $2
 
today.  And 
they asked aneighborin the apartment, by the way we had aone
-
bedroom  apartm ent.  
I had a Murphy bed.  Ireally lo ved that.  It was m echanical.  It couldbe pulled out every 
night.  And at about 9:00 thephone rang.  I was alone. It was aperson
-
to
-
person call 
f rom m y grandparents.  I knew that som ething was wrong because it was 3:00 in the 

m orning in Gleiwit z. 
 
There's a six
-
hour tim edifference between Cleveland and 
(inaudible)and the operator called, obviously the call wasf rom m y mother. I couldn't 

take it. T he operator called every f ive m inutes.  Around10:00m y parents came back.  

T hey got through. It turned out that m y mother's
 
--
 
two of m y m other's brothers were 
arrested. T he business was conf iscated. And they were desperate.  They 

decided
 
--
 
they had originall y thought it would blow over.  T his was not the tim e.  They 
said what can be done?  My f ather tookthe next bus to New York to see that the 

relative that gave the affidavit and atthis point, he saidhe can't takeany more 

responsibility, even though we didn't takea pennyf rom him.  Because
 
--
 
I guess hefelt 
that was too close because that was
 
a son of theperson who had loaned them oney.
 
Bill Benson: W henhe absconded to the United States.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yeah.  Sothat option wasn't possible. W ehad onemore 
event in them eantim eof course war was declared.  My m other'sbrothers did mana
ge  

to get perm ission to imm igrate to Shanghai.T here were two countries that took 

im m igrants. One was Shanghai, occupied Japanat thetim e.  Andthe otherone was 

Dom inican Republic, which wantedtohave the expertise.  Most people closed 

im m igra t io n  a lt
ogether.
 
Bill Benson: Oncethe war began, right?
 

Frank Liebermann:  Once the war began. T hey were on an Italian ship beginning 
of  June in the Mediterranean.W as supposed to go into the Suez Canal. W hen 

Mussolini declared war on Englandand France, due to thefact that the Germans had 

occupied France andMussolinif elt it was safe to join to get theplunders of  war, 

therefore the ship went backand we never heardf rom  the two brothers.  One of them 

was m arried with a 3
-
year
-
old daughter.  Eventually If ound out thatthey perished in 
A u sch wit z.   
Bill Benson:  Didany other f am ily m em bersmake itout, Frank?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Adistant cousin, one that I share a grandparent
 
--
 
step 
grandparents with who lives in
 
--
 
who now li ves in Virginia.
 
B ill B e n s on :   
W as theonly other survivor that you know of ?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.  Another one in California, but this was againf urther 
rem oved.
 
Bill Benson:  Yourfather, af ter he tried to getyour parentsout
 
--
 
his parents and 
couldn't get the affidavit, he thenplayed a role in bringing m any
 
--
 
a num ber of people 

11
 
 
outand was later recognized f or hiseffort tosave survi vors.
 
Frank Liebermann: W ell, during the war, af ter Pearl Harbor,he volunteered and 
was rejected becauseDayton was such
 
--
 
Dayton alm ost doubled in size and they didn't 
want people over 40. So he did stay in Dayton. Af terW orldW arII, hedecided he 
couldn't help hisfam ily.  He
 
--
 
he was a volunteer head ofthe Jewishf am ily service in 
Dayton and basically personally gave 
107
 
aff idavits, of  course with the help of the 
comm unity.  He couldn't do all of  it.
 
Bill Benson:  Right. But over 100.
 
Frank Liebermann:  But 107
 
aff idavitsf or war refugees becauseaf terW orldW ar 
II there were literally m illions of  displaced persons wh
o 
  
had lost their homes and 
he, inf act, was
 
--
 
received an awardf rom  theJewish Resettlement Agency called HIAS 
together with President Trum anf ordoing outstanding things tohelp in immigration. 
 
Bill Benson:  How long did your parents live?
 
Frank Liebermann:  My f ather died in1979 andm y m other in1990.
 
Bill Benson: W e're going to turn toouraudiencefor som e questions in aminute, 
Frank.  But bef ore we do, there'sanother incident that you shared with me too thatI'd 

like you to talk about.  One of
 
them  involved when you f inally did get the belongings out 
that
 
--
 
that youhave sent out of Germ any, wh en they arrived.  You know where I'm 
asking about.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yeah, I know what he's talking about.  I'm  talking about the 
extent of corruption during tim es of stress. Sim ilar,f or instance, you may know about 

the ship, theSt.
 
Louis,where the Cuban consul sold Visas thathe wasn't authorized to 
sell.  And when thepeople gotto Havana, they couldn't getoff . T he ship spent ten days 

off  the coastof  Floridatryin g to resettle, trying to see if  they could get imm igration 

Visas.  Unsuccessfully.  The ship went back to Holland.  Andm ost of those people 

eventually did not survive.  Corruption is something which just happens when people 

are desperat
e.
 
Bill Benson: So you're going to talkabout the
 
--
 
the bicycle.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yeah.  Friendsof m y parents said, why don't you
 
--
 
I know 
you're packing up. W e can put your bicycle
 
--
 
your son's bicycle into a box to make it 
to
 
--
 
t o  give  it  le s s  s
pacef or your packing.  W e'll prepare
 
--
 
have Frank take it over to us 
and we'll box it.  Ihave to go inbackground that when Germ any wen t off the gold 

standard, itbecame all gold coins hadtobe turned in andexchangedf or paper money.  

It was a capital
 
offense to have gold coins.W hen we unpacked the lif t or the container 
in Dayton, of course we unpacked everything, including the bicycle. And shortly 

af terwards got a letter from thisf am ily who had gotten out to Israeland said, look, when 

you unpack the bicycle, please be careful and rem ove the seat.  Inside the f rame we put 

som e gold coins.  Keep them for us and we'll get backto you.W em ay want something 

when we'll be able to get it.  Myf ather became livid because thingswere being checked 

by
 
--
 
whether the lif t was packed, there was a custom soff icial checking out every item  
to see that the right amount of m oney was paid and that it was legal and infact one of 

our suitcases was broken open by theGestapo when we got to the ship.  Nobody 

trusted 
anybody.  Andm y f ather was livid that they
 
--
 
for the sake of their coins that they 
took chances with m y
 
--
 
m ineand m y mother's lives.
 
Bill Benson: As you said, that was
 
--
 
that would have beena capitaloff ense to 
have that f ound.
 

12
 
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yeah. But I think of imm igration and desperation today, and 
it's understandable.
 
Bill Benson:  Frank, thank youfor that. W ehave tim e to turn to our audiencefor 
af ew questions.  Andbef ore we do, let me say f irst we hope that you'll have som e 
questions 
to ask of  Frank. W eask that youuse am icrophone. W e're going to have 
m icrophones in either aisle.  It will be passed to you, so use them icrophone,please.  

Make your questionas brief as you can.  I will  dom y best to repeat the question, just to 

m a ke 
surethat we hear it andhear it correctly, and then Frank will re spond to it.  So I 
think we cantakeafew questions. Let's see, do we have any questionsf romour 

audience?  It'shardfor m e to see with the lights so I'm  going toneed help. T here we 

g
o, I see at leastone handover here.
 
Audience Mem ber: T hank you.  My nam e isDorian. T hank youforyour story.  It 
was m oving.  I just had a question.  Yourfam ily, you say thatthey were deniedaccess 

to Israel.  I just wanted to know wh y, and then, did youand your fam ily e ventually get 

like dual citizenship wit h Israelnow that you can go back andforthto the areaas you 

please?  Just want to know form y curiosity.
 
Bill Benson: If  Ihear the question correctly,you're asking wh y they didn't goto 
Is
rael.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Itseem s that he said that his
 
--
 
the people whoput the gold 
coins were ableto go.
 
Bill Benson: The gold coins, I'm  sorry, aboutthe gold coins.
 
Audience Mem ber: T o Israel, why was his fam ily deniedaccess.
 
Bill Benson: It wasn'tdenied access. It was the questionabout your father's 
opportunity, why he
 
--
 
wh y you didn't move to Israel when your mother went there.
 
Frank Liebermann:  He couldn'tm ake a living.
 
Bill Benson:  Right. Too many doctors.  Right.  And so they could have m oved 
there. He just wouldn't have beenabletopractice his profession.
 
Frank Liebermann: T hey used som e of the gold coins to get out.
 
Bill Benson: Incidentally, did
 
--
 
what happened tothose gold coins?
 
Frank Liebermann:  My
 
--
 
each of m y children 
and m y daughter
-
in
-
law has one to 
use as anecklace.
 
Bill Benson: A necklace.  Okay.  All right.  Do we have another question?We 
have one here.  Yes, sir.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Have you returnedto your hometown?
 
Bill Benson:  Have you returned to your hom e
town?
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes, I did.  Idid itthef irst tim e in 1994 when I took a tripto 
Europe, to easternEurope.  I went to Budapest and Prague and Idecided to takea 

one
-
day trip.  I'd really just wantedto see likeaf ly on the wall what it looked
 
lik e .   I  
didn't want to spend a night there.  AndI didexactly that.  Ifoundmy grandparents' 

business was the
 
--
 
itwas in a strategic area downtown neara bridge.  That house was 
down completely.  Ourhouse was still standing.  I also walked over to a
 
synagogue 
which of  course wasn't thereanym ore.  It was a run
-
down playground.  But what usedto 
be the Jewish old agehome, which was next to the synagogue, was a police station.  

And whenI saw that, Isaid, let's get out of here.  Im ean,there was no reference of any 

kind.  And
 
--
 
Bill Benson:  Not even a placard that said
 
--
 

13
 
 
Frank Liebermann:  Absolutely nothing.
 
B ill B e n s on :   Not h in g.
 
Frank Liebermann:  And I didf ind out ten years later that there were three f ire 
engines at thef ire to prevent that buildingf rom  being burned with the synagogue. T he 
old age hom e was give n 48 hours to clear thespaceand becam e the Nazi 

headquarters.  B
utI didn't know thatat the tim e.  And by the way, the comm unity of 
Gleiwit z did invite us in ten years later when a m em orialplaque was put up,not on that 

ground but on theapartm ent areanext to itbecausethat ground was used
 
--
 
was to be 
used for bui
lding and it was prim e real estate.  And the plaque acknowledged the roleof  
the role of the Jewish comm unity in aiding the gro wth of  the city becausethat, at the 

tim e, was kind of the system of thearistocracy before Germ any andthey sold rights to 

th e
 -- 
when coal was discovered, they didn't want to get their hands dirty and they sold 
rights to entrepreneurs who startedm ining the areas and startedthe steel industry and 

thatareabecame kindof the eastend.  Unfortunately it was brown c oal which was 

hi
ghly polluting.  It's no longer active and it kills a lotof  trees inthe adjoining giant 
m ountains.
 
Bill Benson: I think we probably
 
--
 
one more.  Let's do one more question, and 
then we need to closeour program . T he young m an right here.  Right. Let me just say, 

Frank is going to rem ain on the stage when wef inish in justaf ew m inutes.  W e're going 

to close with som e thoughtsf rom  Frank.  Hewi ll rem ain on the stage.  So if  you want to 

ask him a questionaf terwards, we absolutely invite you andencourage you to come up 

on stage, ask your question of Frank, shake his hand, get your picture taken with him, 

whatever you want todo. So you'll have a chance to chat with him .  Yes, sir.
 
Audience Mem ber: W as there ever a tim ethat when just going outside you were 
af raid of being assaulted or justm urdered?
 
Bill Benson: W hen you were in Germany were there times when you were af raid 
to go outside of being assaulted oreven murderedas a child?
 
Frank Liebermann:  AloneI didn't
 
--
 
Ifelt relativel y saf e.  Ihad m y bicycle, I 
had
 
--
 
we had
 
--
 
I visitedf riends.  It was in groups that it was dangerous because you 
couldn't be easily identif ied.  After Kristallnacht, that was the Night ofBrokenGlass, 

which by which tim e we were already in theUnited States, then
 
you had to wear a 
Jewish star in yellow.  Then I couldn'thave gonef reely andfelt saf e.  Infact, there 

weren't so many cars, it wasn't as dangerousto go places as it is now. 
 
Bill Benson: And that all changed just soon af ter you cam eto the UnitedSt
ates.
 
Frank Liebermann:  Yes.
 
Bill Benson:  Yes.W e're going to closeour program  ina moment wit h Frank.  It's 
our tradition that our
 
F irs t  P e rs on
 
hasthe lastword.  And so Frank will share his closing 
thoughts with us.  Bef ore hedoes, I want to thank allof  youfor being with us.  Rem ind 
you that we'll have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program s eachW ednesday andT hursday until the 
m iddle of August. Sowe hope that you cancom e back and join us. W hen Frank is 
f inished, ourphotographer, Joel, will lead us on thef loor.  Joel is here.  Joel will com e 

up on the stage.  He'sgoing to take a pictureof  Frank with you asthe background. So 

we ask that you stay seated, if  youdon'tm ind, sothat we can getthatpicture taken with 

Frank atthe end of this program . So Fran
k.  
Frank Liebermann:  All right.  I want to add that I've basically m adepeace with 
Germ any.  It's three generations and I'll go back to theBible that Moses was lost in the 

14
 
 
desertfor 40 years, I think that's sym bolic tosaying that it takes two generati
on s  t o 
change a m indset.  Starting the 1990s
 
--
 
by the way, I have gone to Germ any a couple 
of  times on business before,but m y kids really wantedm e to show them where we 
cam ef rom  and inf act I tookeverybody f or the dedicationof that mem orial.  W emet 
in  

Berlin and then drove east and I've
 
--
 
I have to add thatGermany is oneof  those 
countries which has not only acknowledged but has triedtoatonefor what happened to 

a civili zed society.  And I'd liketoadd that this is what them useum  is all about, to keep 

thedark side of hum anity f rom  com ing out.  And that shows in som eof  our exhibits. 
 
I f eel I've had a chance to
 
--
 
to live the American Dream , for which I'm  very 
grateful, and I think I volunteer here becauseI want everybody to try tomake the wo
rl d  

a better place. Ifeel that's m y goal. T hank you.
 
(Applause) 
 
Bill Benson: Thank you.  And rem ember, once Joel'sf inished with Frank and his 
photograph,then please feelf ree, if  you wish, to com eupon stage and say hi to Frank.
