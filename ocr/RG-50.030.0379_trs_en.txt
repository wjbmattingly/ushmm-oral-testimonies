Question: Hello Maria, 
welcome to Wa shington. 
Ans wer:  Tha nk you, J oa n . 

Q: Coul d you tell  me  the na me
 that  you wer e bor n wit h a nd 
when and wher e you were born? 
A: Ye s.  I was born December 26, 1918, which in 
Poland is Christ ma s, so 
I™m a Ch rist mas child. 
And I was born in the city of 
Kolomyja, which at the time I wa
s bor n was Poland, it  was newly  
created Poland.  Before 
t hen, it wa s Ha ps berg, Aust
ria.  Ther efore, my pa
rents spoke  Ger ma n and I 
wa s brought up in the Ger ma n langua ge.  My pare nt
s eventuall y  learned s o me Polis h but they di dn™ t  

like t he language, so at  home t he 
language wa s Ge rman.  When I came
 to school  I nat u rally ha d t o  
learn Poli sh so at the a ge  of fi ve-a nd- a-hal f I e n
te red a Polis h school in Ko
lo- mier ( ph) and I sa id 
something in Polish which didn™
t sound right because 
it was not my initial language.  So the 
childr en, includi ng t he t eacher, start ed laughing, 
ma king fun of me.  Na
t urall y, it  was qui te 
traumati c.  I ran home c r ying, crying I™ll never go
 to school again.  Well , I did go bac k.  And I™ve  
bee n a stude nt for many, ma ny years l ater.  Inte rest
ing enough, when 
I thought about thi s experience  
ma ny  years ago, I think it played an
 i mport ant  role in my
 later life  choice of
 Polish as the aid of 
concentr ations universit y, str ang
e as it may sound.  But t h ere are 
some dynamics that turned it 
upright anyway so this was my 
experience.  Actually, I was writi
ng still, I still am, and German and 
Polish are pretty much my
 la nguages eve n though, 
although they have bot h 
deteriorated.  Well, th e 
way I reme mber Kol o myja, 
it was a small town, althou
gh it wasn™t small to th
e eyes of a chil d.  And 
later when I visited the smaller town
s, the villages around, 
it seemed that Kolomyja
 was big.  It™s an 
interesting thing about Kolo
myja that, as I write abou
t it just years later, ma
ny year s l ater, t hat Ta-
pan- gee  (ph)  wa s a n i mportant  city during the ear lier 
ce nturi es .  It™s ver y old.  They j us t  cele brate d  
seve n hundr ed a nd fi fty years  of the  
birth of the town and they say it 
goes back even fu
rther.  It was

ransa cke d, i t  was de molis hed, it was burne d all t he wa
y, ma ny ti me s, fir st by the Tartar s, t hen by t he  
Mongol s, or vise- versa, t hen by the Cossa cks.  Th
ere we re endless de structi on™s a nd occ upati ons of 
Kolomy ja.  I do not know how far my
 father™s famil y goes back.  
The na me wa s Hi er sch ( ph) a nd I 
wa s bor n a s Matyl da Hi r sch.

My pare nts wa nte d to Polonaise  
my  na me because that was important for them, I assume , as ma ny  
parents do, but at home 
I was called Mattie becaus
e my parents spoke Germ
an.  My father spoke  
Yiddis h wit h ma ny of his hel pers in the stor e  
and busine ss wit h some of the pe ople in t h e  
communit y, but my mot her wa s ve ry
 snobbish about it . 
 She came fr om anot
her cit y c alled Chad-
no- vich ( ph) .  Czer nowi tz was a bi gger cit y, it  
was a ve ry snobbis h ci ty, it was, t hey cal l ed  
themselves small Paris, little Pari
s.  Her parents lived there.  
Actually, I knew only her father  
beca use  he r mother  di ed just be fo
re I was born and I wa
s na med a ft er her mother .  So she ha d that  
air of Cze r nowi tz about  her and s he  des pise d Ko
lomyja and she despised 
Ukrainian town and she 
des pise d t he  Polis h people a nd she didn™t  want  t o 
hear any of t he Yi ddi sh
 l angua ge .  So, s adl y 
enough, I was br ought up in t he 
Ger ma n la nguage and Ger m an wa
s t he l angua ge, but  certainly I  
spoke Polish later and, with my gi
rlfr iends it was always 
Polish.  There was a city itself, I saw it  
onl y for t y ye ars a go for t he fir st ti me I we nt bac k.  
It™s a  ha nds o me cit y now 
and as I read some of 
it™s hist ory, it had a rich history, over  the centurie s
 it was a town in which a lot of trade was goin g 
on.  I t  was on the tr acks bet wee n Pol and a nd Aus t ri
a and Romania , so appa re
ntly busine ss and tra de  
wa s very important.  My own father came fr om 
a whole generation of peop
le who owned t he s a me  
store , t he sa me  business.  This wa s porc elai n a n d 
enamel and gl ass.  So 
we al way s h a d t he very 
beauti ful table settings because oftheir availabili ty.  I remember 
that when my older sister got  
married, and her husband didn™t have a professio
n, so my fa t her took hi m int o the business .  But 
s martly gave  hi m a s peci al divis i on of it, s o he 
became the i mporter of chandeliers.  It all sounds  

very, very st range but thi s was b
ack i n our ti me.  My fat her was 
Orth od ox ,  my mot her ca me al so

fr om a religious family, 
but not as Orthodox.  So there was a 
little bit cheating, I 
suppose, but she 
wore a wig because it 
was i mport ant i n our home 
t own.  My fat her was a fo
l lower of Rabbi, he was 
a Hasi dic, a follower of a 
Ra bbi call e d Wis hnitz, he 
came fr om t he city of Vi
nnit sa .  Appar entl y he  
wa s i mport a nt in the Rabbinic al dyna sty and as a 
child I re me mber the Wi shnit z (ph) Rabbi c o ming 
and staying in our home 
a nd I didn™t li ke it . 
Q: Wh y?  
 

01: 06: 59 

 

A: I was cr ushe d by t he, by the tone of all t hese 
pe ople .  He would c o me, I wa s ver y young t he n, he  
would c o me  Thur sday night
 for Sukkot bat.  So 
on Thur sday night , from 
the railway station, he  
wo uld come  escorted by about 20
0 hus-a- de m (ph), some  fr om hi
s  own e ntourage™ a n d s o me from 
our home  town, a nd 
bec ause i t  was dark, it wa s eve ning, t he y
 would c o me wit h, the  Ger ma n na me  
comes back, ﬁFalkenﬂ, t hese li ghti n
gs, strobes carried in the street
, torc he s, right?
  No w it co me s 
back.  I so metimes think in German
 from my chil dhood
 ye ars .   So they we re full of t or ches  and t o  
the dark night of my home town
, which was ver y Anti- Se mi tic, alt hough I wasn™t e x pos ed t o it , I  
sens ed i t , a n d the wome n woul d st and on t he bal co
ny a nd gr eet the m, sa w t h e m comi ng i n.  Si nce I 
wa s so young, to me  this 
was an over whel ming pi ctur e and I s aid I  di dn™t  li ke 
it.  They a
ll came into 
our house , whi ch wa s big and he woul d give hi m 
the bi gge st room.  In fr
ont of his  room was a  
Gabbai, a Gabbai was the assistan
t of t he man who collect ed the qu
itels, and quitels is something 
that a  Je w would write out on a pa
per asking the Rabbi for advice. 
 So t oget her wit h  the pa per I  
assume  that t he Ra bbi got  
the mone y t oo.  I s us pec t it so.  But  
a nywa y, t he Ga bba i st ood in fr ont of  
our li vi ng r oom whe re t h e Rabbi held court a nd 
he would see people .  Hundre ds of pe ople  would  
walk through our home.  And to 
me  this was overwhel mi ng, very unhappy ki nd of e xperi enc e.  I 
wa s the younge st and I think on me
 i t  wor ked mo re than on my sister s because I was already bor n 
into Poland, it ma de a difference.
  Since I™ m t he youngest , my ex
perience of learning school and 
other wi se  was di ffere nt  t han that
 of my older  si st ers.  It  s h
ows  you the  mea ning of hist ory.

Q: What™s  the di ffere nce  i n a ge  bet w ee n you a nd your si ster s?  
A: Five ye ar s eac h, fi ve years eac h.  My ol der sis t
er was Cyl a , C-Y-L- A i f  you want it , and t here  
was a di ffer ence of t w enty
 years bet wee n us all.  I™ m not s ur e
, but something like 
it.  She married  
Jacob Gol dst ein, a man fr om Lvov who didn™t ha ve
 mone y and di dn™t have muc h of a profe ssi on , 
but he was the s on of a  Tal mudis
t    and to my father, that 
was i mpor t ant.  So, t h ere was a 
tre mendous we ddi ng, all  my s i
ster s had tre mendous we ddi ngs 
except me, and thei r  only son, 
Mene k,  sur vive d the wa r.  I don™t know whether I shou
ld go into, she was killed i n the last da ys of  

the ghetto and her husb
and was transported to 
t he Belz ec  Exter mi nati on Ca mp i n 1942.   
 

01: 10: 01 

 

Anywa y, tha t  was my sist er, Cyla , 
and she live d a pretty mi ddl e-clas s, it wa s prett y pros perous .  Her  

hobby was to do petite work, 
petite point, and I rememb
er her beautiful pictures
 on the walls, all her 
own work.  Thi s was  her  
hobby.  She  was wel l kno
wn i n t o wn, s he ha d gi r l
fri ends and when thei r 
son was bor n, it was a great thi ng be caus e he wa s 
the onl y boy i n the fa mi
l y, unti l  t hen we ha d 
not hing but  girls .  Now t he next 
si ste r  was  Fri eda , her na me , my si
ster  Cyla, wa s Cy
la Goldstein,  
that was her  na me and her son i s Me nek Gol dst ei n, 
a nd he survive d.  M y next si ster was Frie da . 
She was ve r y bea uti ful.  Frie da marri ed a ma n wh
o was a c ous in, a s econd co
usin.  He came from 
Cal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort t o
wn , very well known spot in Eu rope
.  Hi s father wa s a brother of 
my father, but that was of
 a di fferent mot her so they wer e st
ep-br ot hers.  And ther efore, it was 
permitted fo r them to marry, even 
so, they worried that
 they™re offspring ma
y suffer from it and be 
mentall y ret arded, what ever.  She ain™t, she™ s a doct
or of eye diseases.  She 
turne d out to be okay. 
But this we dding, I reme mb er vaguely.  I only re
me mb er my dres s, I d on™
t kno w why .   It was t he  
most beautiful dress I™ve ever ha
d.  And their wedding wa
s held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit  
bigger than Kolomyja.  Th
is is somehow, I still 
remember.  No, sh
e lived in Karlsb
ad (ph) whic h 
me ans  s he li ved in a pri v ilege d place  beca use  Karl sb
a d ( ph)  was a  be auti ful 
international spot and

he was ma ki ng a good li ving, he ha d ma ny patie nts 
s o it was  sort of high life .  Anyway, i n 1938 
Hitler occupied . . . 

Q: Wait , you™ve mi sse d a sister . 

A: Oh, you wa nt to go
 t his way, s ur e.  The n t he younger sist er
, als o fi ve years  yo
unger, is 
Fra nia .   
Frania survived.  By the way, my
 sister  Fr ieda  sur vived and i n
 Czechoslovakia th
ey got out of 
Dorosig into Palestine. 
 She™s still alive, she™s unfortunately 
in a nursing home no
w and her husband 
died a few years ago.  Th
en, there™s my sist er, Fr an
ia.  She™s alive, she liv
es in my nei ghbor hood , 
her hus ba nd wa s kill ed, a nd t he y™re c hild, Lasz ek, Al
e x, was a bout thr ee ye ars ol d i n t he  ghe tto and 
mira cul ously he survive d  and he li ve s in Ne w 
York City.  Though s he l ater re- marri ed and her  
second husband adopte
d him so his name is
 Alex Gitter man.   
 

01: 13: 04 

 

And then comes me.  I 
was the youngest.  No, 
my sisters still had a ba
ckground of Hapsberg , 
Austria , a lthough Fr ania  
wa s very young then.  In 1916 I beli
eve, my par ents ra
n fr om Kolomyja 
because of t he war .  And they cam
e to, t he y ra n t o a plac e which is
 ne ar Sigit, Ma
rmorosk I think, 
whi ch is where Wiesel comes fro
m, whi ch was a  bor der of Romani
a a nd Hungary. 
 There were 
large Jewish communities th
ere.  My father went 
into hiding there becausethe Austrian army was 
bus y tr ying t o find me n t o fight t heir  war , t hey ne ed
ed my father naturally, so
 t hey lived a very, very  
difficult kind of life.  I think they
 lived in Mon-room-a-vot
 (ph).  And at
 that time I 
still had another 
sister , who m  I neve r met , she die d ri ght t here . 
 She was bet w een Cyl a  an
d Fri eda and I think she 
was fourteen years old wh
en she developed a seri
ous appendix cond
ition and there wa
s no time t o  
get to the hospital, she died right 
in my fa ther™ s ar ms , I underst a nd. 
 Some t hings that I hear d about  
years l ater , my par ents didn™t tal k about it, but
 it was always in the ai
r and I sus pecte d tha t  
somet hing happened ther e, but I sa
y, I was bor n aft er, I didn™ t  kno
w.  Only about te n years ago, 
walking in the beautiful wo
ods of Switzerla nd, my mo
t her™s younger brother tol d me a b out it .  The y  
talke d about her in s o me wa ys , her na me wa s Yett
a, but it was hus he d-hus h ed and it wa s  never quite

there .  I™ m s ure that my child
hood was spent i n a  fa mi ly whi c h 
suffere d fr om de pres si on, yet it wa s 
not, it was covered over.  
Probably because 
my father was a Hasidic and 
in the Hasidic tradition, joy 
and pai n are  mi xed.  So, I thin
k so, in looki ng back at it t ha t
 my chil dhood was ver y comple x 
because it was a Hasi dic family an
d my mot he r  was , h a d t hat air 
of a bigger city with more 
civilization and the co
untry in which I liv
ed was Polish Anti-
Semitic, so I woul
d think I have the  
strength of all of that in some
 way i n my o wn p e rso nalit y.  But , I re me mb er ther e wer e  ti mes o f  
when my mother woul d cry a nd t his
 wa s the anni versa r y, not onl y of 
t he deaths of my sister a nd he r 
daught er, but the de ath of her mot h
er .  They all li ved i n that hidi
ng place near Si
git t h ere and my 
grandmother, her mother, di
ed of a heart attack, appa
rently still a you
ng woman, so for 
my mother it 
must have bee n a horri ble loss .  
She would go to visit her father
 later, she once took me to  
Czernowitz and thi s I remember .  These thi ngs ar e 
very vague in my me mory
 because they were not  
talked about, but it was there in
 the air and fro m time to time
 I woul d over hea r some thi ng.   
 
 

01: 16: 01 

 

There™s a good possibility 
I tried to protect myself fr
om the pain too. 
 So I grew up in
 this fa mily in 
whi ch I was extre me l y i mporta nt be caus e onl y year
s ba ck lat er, I could under sta nd the i mport anc e  

of me .  Bec ause I ha d to replac e all  these los ses , I™ m s ure.  So, I was a n  extre mel y overpr ote cted  

child to the extent that I hated 
it, I was embarrassed by it.  When 
I sneezed, t here was i m mediately a 
doct or ar ound me.  Whe n I went 
t o school , and I forg
ot my brea kfast , s o me body fr om t he st ore 
would knoc k at the door 
of my cl ass a nd br ing me the br eakfast
.  My mothe r  was extr e m ely anxi ous  
about me  and my par ent s over-pro
tected me in a way 
which probabl y hel ped the m some  way but  
also did not.  So my sist
er Frania, I think, was a l
ittle bit jealous, I never kn
ew about it because no  
matt er what I did was fi ne.  Whic h 
means I wasn™t prepared for the ha
rdships of life 
that later came 
my  way .  I  wa s a c hil d wh o c
oul d never do wr ong.  And t hey 
thought I was br
ight and I did 
extremely well in school.  To the 
end of my si ster because she didn
™t do so well , s he  wa s pr etty an d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379

she  like d t o go wit h boys  an
d she wasn™t so interested in studies.
  I was, all of my
, the  grades  wer e  
always a bove ‚A™ , you know?   Onc e I brought a ‚ B™,
 I cri ed for weeks!  I 
got a ‚B™ in mathematics  
whi ch was unbeli evable because it was always ‚A™s 
in other s ubje cts and my pre fe rred subje ct wa s 
Polish literature, ro ma
ntic Polish literature. 
Q: Di d this create a probl e m 
between you and your mother? 
A: No.  I was a child who was s mar t.  I don™t thi
nk I wa s pr etty, my si st ers we re pre tty, my t wo  

sisters , Fra ni a and Frie da were  ver y  prett y, but 
I never experienced a sens
e that I wa sn™t okay. 
Looks  di dn™t  mat t er.  I was acc ept ed. 
 I say I was, scholasti call y, I di
d so e x tre mely well .  My sist er, 
Frania, still remembers wit h pai n 
t h at when my mother  woul d go 
to t he t eachers for t he periodic 
visitati ons, t hey would s ay, how co
me your da ughter, Fr ani a, c annot do that  well?   I™ m s ure it didn™t  
do her  a ny good, but t hat ™s
 wh at she  r e me mbe r s.   
But  s he  was  very pr etty. 
Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t your violin playing?  
A: Oh, how do you know t his
?   As , I must  ha ve  bee n si x ye ars ol
d, ei ght year s old, I ™ m not  sure.  
My par ent s hired a violi n teac her for Frani a a
nd my sel f .  And we di dn™ t like it.  But anyway, I  
ma stere d in playi ng t he Hati kva so
 e very Saturda y night, ma ny gue
sts , our  hous e wa s full of guests  
always .   

 

01: 19: 07 

 

I think I still carry this tradition to 
some extent.  We had to
 play, the ha-tic-fa (p
h) had to play, a few 
other things.  It wa s not 
something that I really lik
ed very muc h.  Pr obabl y 
I couldn™t identify  with 
the teacher .  We al so had a teac
her of Hebre w . Darli s Bate (ph) . 
 And him we hated!  He was a 
poor, ol d J e w who di dn™ t know t o t e
ach.  My sist er a nd I use  to brib
e  hi m,  give hi m a  zloty a nd he  
would go, he would leave earlier.  
Unfortunately, we didn™t learn mu
ch so until these 
days, I cannot 
read any of the Hebrew text and 
I™ m sorr y a bout  it, I  wish I coul d.
  But  t h is wa s my  mo ther , my  
mo ther look ed away because it wasn ™t
 as i mporta n t to her and a s girl
s , we were not suppose t o lear n 
much of the Hebrew text.  We 
never was suppose to go to synago
gue until you're marri
ed so I never

we nt t o s yna gogue  be cause when 
I married, t he war was on and I™ve
 never gone t o a  synagogue .  I  
remember, right after t h e war, 
t her e was some gather
ing of the American 
soldi ers and I was 
included and it was i n a synagogue in Hei delber
g, I™m not even sure, but 
occasi ona lly I  go now to 
religious service but a sy
nagogue is not part of 
my life and this is b
eca use  of my ba ckground. 
Q: Were your friends primarily,
 if not all together, Jewish? 
A: All were  Jewi sh .  We
ll, in pri ma r y school, what you cal l
, ele ment ary school , ther e  were non-
Je wish stude nts too.  I do not re
c all c o ntact wit h the m.  I ha d t wo 
clos e frie nds , both we re nei ghbor s  
on bot h side s of our house.  We  use  to visit  wit h
 each ot her .  My main
 preoccupati o n was with 
readi ng.  When my gir l friends 
woul d c o me  and to a sk wher e I wa
s, my mot her or  whoe ver  wa s  
around woul d s ay, you™ll 
fi nd he r i n a  book!    
 

01: 21: 00 

 

Thi s wa s my childhood
, I was an avi d  reader .  But  I liked to pl ay wit h them and 
both of them were 
killed, but we use to go aw
ay a lot.  I think this to
o established my pattern of 
traveling later in life. 
For ten weeks, every year, my parent
s would remove me fr om
 school a little earlier.  It had to start 
the 15th of June and I 
wouldn™t come back until so
metime in September.  
Every year we would go  
to the mountains.  My mo
ther believed that we didn
™t look well enou
gh, that  we  ne ed
ed all the fresh 
air.  She  beli eve d i n t hese  thi ngs .  So we  went  
to t he Carpati an Mount ains 
beca use  my home  town i s  
surr ounde d by the Carpatian M ount a
ins, Kolomyja is the entry to
 the Carpati an M o untai ns .  We 
would go to di fferent pl aces, the 
names may mean not hing, 
but fr om ti me t o ti me t hey crop up. 
Los uv , Ga re mc ze,  Delat yn,
 these were the places
.  The wa y we  would go,
 it was so 
funny, my 
fat her woul d stay be hind and he 
woul d come one wee k.  But we wo
uld go for t he te n wee ks a nd we 
took everything along because thes
e were pretty primitive villas.  
My mo ther insisted on a villa 
whi ch was i nside and which was al wa ys s urr ounde
d by tre e s; apple tr ee s, pear tre es  and plumb  
trees .  Pol and has a  lot  of ver y delici ous  fruit  s o t h
ere ha d to be tre es , that
 was the requirements of 
hiring a villa.  And it had to be close to the street

look and see some tra ffic but not too c lose s o nobo
dy would c o me cl os e to us
.  And it had to be on a 
little river.  On a little stream.  
And we would go swimming there,
 not swimming 
really, sitting  
under the st one s.  My si ster, Cyl a, ma de it int o  
her real hobby.  She woul
d go ever y morni ng, s it 
under these stones in wh
ich you had a, what do 
you call it, little water fa
ll and she would sit there 
for hours  hoping s he  would loose  
we ight  thi s wa y.  She  was  over w eight and s he wa nted t o l oose  
wei ght , t his wa s he r idea .  One da
y, she deci ded she r eall y wants t o
 do it  more profes sionally so 
there was a man from Warsa
w, a Poli sh man, who ran a special 
spa for the loosi ng wei g ht.  He wa s  
Anti-Semitic to the core.  His na
me was Dr. Tarnovsky, 
but Jewish middle-cla
ss wo men like all the 
other s went there t o loos e wei ght .  We ll, s he di
dn™t li ke tha t  too much so one da y t hey had a n  
aft ernoon of f and she 
went to t he vill age and sh
e move d i nto Kondi torai , a 
ca fe .  Koni torai I kne w  
was a very special institutio
n.  It™s coffee and hot 
chocolate and there was beau
tifu l pastries.  So, s h e 
eats her e pas t ry and drinks the chocola t e and here 
wal ks in Dr. Tar novsky a nd 
he sees that thing, he 
walks over to her an
d he slaps  her, ri ght a cross her  face .   
 
01: 24: 02 

 

We ll, this was an awakenin
g for her .   She never  we nt
 back to that spa anym
ore.  But this was the 
situation.  Part of it was, anti-
Se miti s m i n Pol a nd just ha d it s full wa y, i n di ffere nt wa ys , but I  

pers ona lly di d not experi ence it in ele me ntar y school
, perhaps not in ele me nta
ry s chool but in High 
School.  Until I come to that, I 
remember these di
fferent locations of our 
traveling to for this 
summer , and it was a whole tri p.  In front of us
 was always a carriage 
with hor ses which would  
carry our be ddi ngs , our dishes, ou
r hous ehold kosher whic h me ant 
you neede d doubl e dis hes , a nd 
some furni shings .  This wa s in fr
ont and i n the back wa
s Fi a kev, a dros h-ka (p
h) , wi t h my mother , 
my father if it wa s for 
the week- end and all children.  There 
was a mai d, a woma
n to clean and i t  
had t o be a J e wi sh ma id t o cook
 be ca use we  were  Kosh
er.  So comi ng t o t hes
e pla c es , my mot her  
belie ved in good air, fre sh a ir a nd 
food.  So s he wa nte d 
us t o  dri nk mi lk fr om
 t he cow.  And she  
would bribe us.  So 
food wa s always somet hing whic
h t hey ha d to be g us t o eat.  I would get eit he r

a zloty or a big piece of chocolat
e to drink that milk and I always
 managed to avoid drinking that 
mil k.  It wa s a ga me going on, I stil l hate milk for this re as on.  I was s o osti oper os i s probabl y  
beca use  I di dn™t drink enough mil k. 

Q: This time  away fr om, did th
is ma ke all of you mu ch clos
er  than you would ha ve  be e n?  
A: We  were  a ver y cl ose  fa mi ly, 
al ways a ver y cl ose famil y.  Clos
e i n t he famil y was a prescri ption 
I™ m su re o f my  fa mi ly , pro babl y be caus e  it™ s a  
Jewish tradition but prob
ably because they had 
suffer ed losses.  So, t o my pare nts, the busi ness was i mport ant  
to my fat her  and he
 was  a  ver y good 

businessman, fa mily was all that mattered, always.  
And to us it still does. 
 Now we have fragments 
of the fa mily but fa mily is still ve
ry important to us, to all of us. 
 So I was brought up with this, I 
was suffocated by it, I really didn
™t like t hat much cl oseness.  
And with my coll
ea gues who ha d 
more space , and I al wa ys  want ed 
mor e space .  My whole tra v eling i n my life wa s always get tin g 
more space.  These were t he co
nse que nces  of t hat e motiona
l overcrowding, extremely so. 
Q: Were there political di
scussions that you reme
mber as you grew up? 
 

01: 27: 06 

 

 

A: By the way, yes.
  I wasn™t involved politically until some
ti me later in my 
gymnasium years. 
Yes, the Kolomyja, 
like most towns in Polan
d, had a lot of political di
visions among the Jewish 
people.  There was t he Main Zionist , and t here were
 Left Zionist, the Commun
ist, the Socialist, the 
Libe rals , the Divisionist s, you na me
 it.  Amazing, a small 
city like Kolomyja 
whi ch onl y had 40,000 
people, half of them were
 Jewish, they had about 
a fe w Jewish news
papers.  It was 
a highly literate 
city.  I wa sn™t a mong t h e m be cau
se my pa rent s prote ction s o me how
 or  othe r e xcluded me .  M y  
pare nts pr ot ection and my nee d for  the Polis h pa
triotis m somehow 
e xcl ude d me much from it , a s  
strange as it is.  But I had liberal ideas.  My pare
nts, my father worried a
bout it, that I was going 
very liberal at one poi nt.  But I  
di dn™t joi n a part icular  gr oup. 
 Howe ver , t here were many, ma ny  
groups .  Mos t  of t he  Je wi sh people
 in Kolomyja as in mo
st of Poland were poor
.  Th ere were people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379

who wer e re ally poor a n d then t h
er e was the mi ddle cl ass, upper 
mi ddl e c l ass, a nd a very fe w who 
wer e re ally e xtre mel y ri c h.  Ther e must have  be e
n, but in my home town th
e middle class and upper 
middle class were the rich people.
  I reme mber, I still have a great
 pain when I think about the  
poverty in my home town.  
My fir s t me mo ry  is o f t h
e wat er carriers.  We  liv
ed in a house in which 
the apart ment was on top of t he bu
siness and there wer e wide st aircas
es.  And the wat er carriers, al l  
wh o m wer e  Je wish , t hey  wer e  car
ryi ng up t he water, big ca ns, beca
use there was no other wa y of  
getting water.  The water came fr om
 a main fountain in 
the city, on Mokra Str
eet.  Mokra Street is 
well known because t h ere are sur vivors li ke 
Do v Noi , wh o™s well  
know, he comes from 
Mokr aSt r eet .  Ma ny people live d on Mokr aSt r eet .  It
 was the poorest neigh
bor hood and there  was a 
big fountain and t he wate r carrier s 
possibly were on the lowest ra
nk of the J ewi sh c o mmunit y.  An d 
they carried that water upstair s. 
 I r e me mber onc e, on a ver y cold
 da y, a n d Kol o myja being in the  
Ukraine, a cold, col d cli mat e. 
 I asked my mo ther, how
 come t his ma n has i ce on his hands ?  
Does n™t he li ke t o wear glove s?  
 This wa s my awakening, that so
me pe ople  didn™t have mone y for  
gloves .  The  poverty wa s  everywher e
 and when I think of 
that poverty, I think of them like of the 
closest fami l y because t h er
e was no r i ght for t he m t o
 suffer such an end as 
the se peopl e did.  They 
really never  had any life.  Ther e was a lot of 
stigma about being poor and there was a lot of 
sukkotme .   
 

01: 29: 52 

 

In my Hi gh Sch oo l , whic h wa s a Jewi sh Gy mn asi u m,
 it wa s one of the sets of gymnasiums, it wa s a 
chai n of, called Zyowskie Towa
r zys towo sz kot y Ludoweii Sre dui g, it wa s a  chain of Je wis h  
Gymnasiums established in
 Pola nd, whi ch wa s r un by the Je wis h 
parent s , who esta bli she d it.  The y  
paid for it, it was extr
emely expensive.  Someho
w or other, beca use  ther e was no gymnasi u m for  
Je wish girls aft er ele me n tary s chool , ten parents 
got t oget her  and esta blis hed it .  M y pare nts a nd  
nine  ot her s.  And t he y t ook i n 
one  pa re nt who didn™ t  ha ve  mone y. 
 Their  n a me  was  Nei ma n an d s he  
was Sophia Neiman.  I st
ill remember the pain
 and the stigma and the sens
e of sukkotme
.  She wore 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
12 
 
clothes whic h ca me  from Ame r ica , whi c h mea n s 
she had a coat which wa
s red.  Only American 
childr en wor e red coat , we never wore  red coat .  In High Sc hool you wore navy.  And thi s was s uc h  
a stigma tic t hing.  And a not her th
ing I remember is that
 outside wa s a school 
building, wa s an old 
Je w who wa s selli ng s o me food, po
tatoni k, and you could b
uy it wit h butter or wi th mar gari ne . 
Marga r ine  was hal f pric e  of but ter, a nd she  woul d 
buy the margari ne pot ato. 
 All these things stay 
with me  because it wa s so unjust.  
Well, of t he ten st uden
ts , we  were  ten  stud en
ts and ten teachers. 
All teachers were Jewish. 
 They came from 
Warsaw, fr om the bi
g cities.  We  had 
to be more pious  
than t he Pope in achi eving our accr editati on 
because the commissi on wo
uld come  down fr om 
Warsaw and we had to be 
good.  So we had 
ten t eachers t o ten st udents. 
 And of the 
t en st udents, 
miraculously, unbelievably, all surv
ived!  All the teache
rs were killed.  I wa
nted to bring yo u 
pictures, some how I couldn
™t get it down fr om my wa
ll, it was h
eavy.  But I be ju
mping a little bit.  
Thi s was the gymnasi u m year
s and it wa s all Je wi sh st ude nts, all Je
wish teacher s.  It was consi dered 
a high le vel gymnasi u m.  It is descri bed in th
e book about Pol and by Dr. 
Sylvia Helli
ar d, you ma y 
know about it, called ﬁAn Ai r of
 De str uctionﬂ .  She  ha s quite
 a  bit about  t hes e sc hools .  
Q: Were you all close, all the 
students, including the one wh o wa
s somewhat sti g mat ized or what 
about that one? 

A: Well, she was not stigma
ti zed by us, we just fel t  
the stigma .  I felt the sti g ma.  For re ason, I don™t  
know why, I still don™t know why I id
entified with the un
derdog.  Some way or
 other I assume it 
eventuall y led me to soci al wor k, 
but I di dn™t  know t he  ori gins  of it. 
Q: But you, of c our se , were li
ving i n very pr ivile ged wa ys?  
A: I lived by comparison, I™ m su
re here i n America it  now woul
d not be beca use  of it , but by  
comparison with the others
, and I had a lot of
 pain about it.  Probably 
was a part of my rebelling  
agai nst my parents, whatever it  
was that came into it, 
that I became very lib
eral .  The pai n about  
witnessing so much poverty s
till stays with me whenever I th
ink about what happened.  Bu t 
anyway.. So, this was th
e  gymnasi u m years , we had to st udy a 
lot.  We had to st udy Lati n, ei ght 

years of Latin, that™s a lot of Lati
n.  We ha d to st udy, th
e onl y thing we didn™t li
ke is religion.  Of 
course because the teacher 
wasn™t great.  I had marv
elous teachers of Polish
 literature, one of them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
13 
 
became my role model.  I think sh
e playe d an i m porta nt par t  in my choic e of t his pr ofe ssi on later .  
We  had a teacher of German litera
ture, we had mathematics, which 
was not my subj
ect somehow or 
other .  But I  coul dn™t a f f ord to ha ve a ‚B™ e ver s o 
my pa rent s hire d a tut or.  I fell i n love wit h the  
tutor , my firs t adole sce nt crus h, a
nd a learne d it and I pass ed e x a ms ver y we ll.  The n we had a l ot of 
gym.  I wasn™t great in 
gym,  just passing.  Wh at 
el se di d we ha ve?   Certai
nl y ge ography and hist or y ,  
history was always  my great i ntere
st and re mai ne d s o.  Geogr aphy a n
d hi s t ory.  I n t he Uni ver sity, I  
had to deci de, st udy wa s  hist ory.  I belie ve t hat
 you don™t  under sta nd pe opl
e  without  hist ory.  I n  
thos e days , I  didn™t unde rstand it but  now I  tea c
h my st udent s  that you 
do not  under st and pe opl e  
without knowing history of their pe
ople.  Well, we™ll come
 to it later, but anyw
ay, I consider it as 
part of the web of the personality
, historic events.  Those days I 
did not understand it this way, just 
liked history.  Ever y single strut in the roadway, 
you know, I had to me mor i ze.  We ha d to, we had  
to deci de a  i n High Sc hool an
d I was very good at it becaus
e I memor i zed Mi
ckiewicz, Sc he n-
kavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were
 the very famous
, and later came the pos
itivists and I was really, 
this was my life!  It still is, reading, I™ m still a n 
addict in rea di ng.  I don™t r e membe r  now be cause 
my  mi nd doesn™t work well but in 
those days I abso
rbed it  all .  
Q: Wh at attracted yo
u to the positivists? 
A: It was lit, oh sure, it 
was after the romantics wh
o needed a pause!  Or
zeszkowa, Aun-jus-kov-a 
(ph) .  The  ot her da y, the y  ha d a fe
w mont hs ago, they ha
d a  fil m festi val  of Polis h movi es a nd there  
wa s a mar ve l ous , mar vel ous movi e of
 Orz esz kowa, I for got what it wa
s, it was fant
astically well  
done, but the positivists.  And then 
when I came to the, this was all 
in High School.  
It™s amazing, I 
didn™t ha ve any c onflict wit h Poles 
a t  that point .  I studi ed s o  ma ny year s  in high sc hool , we wer e 
totally isolated.  We 
didn™t experience it.

I didn™ t know, my father  had so me
 c ustome r s who wer e Polis h, but I 
didn™t have a ny cont act.  So, 
anti- Se miti s m wa s not hi ng t hat was experienced pers ona
lly except that it wasn™t
 i t , but you kne w i t  
wa s t here .  
Q: Di d your  pare nts  talk about it?  

A: No .  I knew th at my father 
would bribe t he tax accounta nts , wh
en they came, t h
e ta x ma n.  He  
would se nd t he m fa nta sti c sets  of
 porcelain for Christ mas, as I re
me mb er, because of our discussion 
what to choose for t hese peopl e, so they were br
i bed.  He would gi ve some
 of t he m disc ounts , I  
know, t hat  l ater s ave d my li fe  in str a nge  ways.  
The Ukrai nians were very 
poor.  This was a Polish 
regi me a nd Ukraini ans wer e bot h ill iterate and poor
.  The y wer e pea sants, the y would come into  
store bare foot, I re me mber that. 
 And t hey would al wa ys buy dis h
es which were considered very 
inferi or, fia n ce (ph) , cera mic .  They
 wer e pai nted.  The y woul d buy big di shes , pai nte d, big di she s  
for soup, or whatever else.  But the fine porcelai
n wa s al way s for the Pol i
sh and for some of the 
Je wish fa mil i es too.  But 
my father di d more t ha n this, ha ndli n
g the people  fr om 
the cit y, but fr om 
all over t he y  ca me .  It  was a n e stabli she d busi ne
ss for the Province.  And 
the provinci al peasants 
wer e ver y, very ma ny.  So we go
t both the Ukrainian peasants wo
uld come  in and the Polish pe opl e 
wer e the ari stocr acy, in a way.  
An d the n ther e  were J e wis h pe ople wit h mon e y .  Thi s was th e  
clientele and there were many helper s in the st ore 
and that ™s where I pic ke d  up Yi ddi sh beca use t hey 
spoke Yi ddi sh to a ver y  large e xte nt .  We had 
a  bookkeeper  who s urvi v ed
 the war, we had my  
brot her-i n-la w, my ol der sister™ s, her hus ba nd l ate r 
joined and he had the  pr
esent ation of chandeliers  
and e na mel  bath tubs . 

Q: E na mel  wh at?  

A: Bath tubs .  Tubs  for t he bat h
.  Thi s was all  new because t h ere 
wa s no wa y of ha vi ng any, wate r 
didn™t come into the apartment so
 you had to pour it, so the bath 
tubs we had for that luxury of 
taking a bath.  And he wa s doi ng very well t his wa y but
 it wa s part of the busine
ss.  So t hat™s where ,  
Yiddis h you coul d hear i n the stor e, t hey spoke 
Yiddis h, the se  boys.  One 
of the m survived, I met  
hi m a ft er t he  war, I c oul dn™t belie ve
 it, but, the rest were all killed
.   I  re me mb er s
eei ng them over 
the, over  in t he ghetto.

But, I, so I was sort of isolated
 or pr otecte d fr om actual confr ont
ation with anti-Semitism, but as I 
said, it was always in th
e air.  For  i nstance, on
 Yo m K i p per  my pare nts 
wo uld go to synagogue, 
natur ally, we girls sta ye d home .  And we al wa ys  
barrica ded ours elves.  We wer e a fr aid al ways t o  
stand in the window or on the ba
lc ony, the bal cony was a bi g part of
 our li fe .  We li ved on the main  
street call ed Kol - soy- oi (ph) , yo
u could see pe opl e wal k bac k  and fort h and my mot h er was very  
orientated towards clothes, 
she was critical of this, th
is dress is too lo
ng and this is to
o short and this 
is too bri ght  and so on
, but on Yom Ki pper  ni ght, 
so me of these nights it 
wa s for b i d d e n fo r us  t o  
show our faces, thi s I remembere
d.  We worried, although we never 
e xperi e nce d it, that some of t he 
Polish or Ukrainian goons will co
me  and knoc k out windows so there 
was this sense of
 pani c all t h e  
time .  In our town there were so
 ma ny Je ws , hal f of 
the popul ation wa s Je wis h.  You coul d see the 
di ffere nce .  Sudde nl y it wa s ve ry da rk, it was very 
quiet , all  the st ore s wer e cl ose d, most store s  
belonged t o the Je ws.  No body 
moved, not hing move d.  And the n 
you alwa ys thought, some body 
will come, knock at  the door, knock out the wi
ndow, it happened occasiona
lly but I myself did not 
experience this.  But I do recall the fe eling of so
me anxie t y, pe rha ps eve n panic, that it mi ght 
happe n.  So I say, I kne w  about it
, but  not in a pers onal  way.  Yom Ki
pper wa s very difficult, we all 
pass ed it, I didn™t a ft er a certai n age , but Yom Ki ppe
r I remember as it was dark in the apartment .  

The r e was  a very se vere f ast.  The 
bre aking of the fa st, pe opl e wer e 
ve ry tir ed or sl owly coming out  
of s yna gogues, t he y wer e pra ying all  da y there .  Thi s 
I r e member wit h a great
 deal of pain.  The  

Kle z mar would c o me , to pray for 
us , a ha ppy, a h , the se peopl e were
 very poor.  These  are ol der  
Je ws.  Very poor , a nd t hey woul
d go from house to hous
e.  It was my j ob,
 because I was the 
youngest at home, I 
di dn™t go to synagogue and 
because I was there whil emy parents had to come 
fr om the synagogue, to gi
ve t he m some  food to break the  fast . 
 I reme mber as a child carryi ng t hat 
tray of hone y cake .  And they woul d pray, the y w
oul d pray a n d then they would go, s o meti mes the y  
came back l ater at dinner ti me.  
I stil l mour n these Kl ez
mar because they wer e 
so poor.  It was so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379

wr ong that a  night li ke t hat, a f ter fas t , the y ha
d to go a nd pra y.  The Kl
as - ma s(ph) music ha s not  
survived, the type of 
pai n when I hear , it™s not  good, it™
s not  aut h entic  enough for  me .   
 
01: 42: 03 

 

I must be honest , there™
s  very fe w pe ople who re me
mber how it was.  They 
pla ye d i n short slee ved 
out fit s, I ca n™t even, Perl ma n pla ys .  He™ s doi ng i t
 well I suppose but he™ s 
not good enough for me  
because I r e member t he au
thentic pla yers .  Who c oul d teac h th
ese young peopl e her e, t hey all we nt  
to the ovens.  This is the stor
y of the Kle z mar in our home town, 
they al ways pl aye d a t  we ddi ngs , 
the weddings for my fa mily were ve
ry big, and none of th
em survived from wh
at I know.  Anyway, 
it wa s not ri ght t hat people who have suffere d so 
much pover t y and s o much
 i ndi gnit y shoul d e ve r  
have t o e nd up this  wa y.  It wa sn
™t  fair.  But in our home town, this
 was the st ory, t his wa s tr ue for  
many of the other littl e towns t oo, 
al l over Poland, particularl y in 
these pl aces.  So, this was Yom 
Kipper , my pare nts would come hom
e , al ways wit h hea dac hes , tired, but brea king the fast was  
unli ke here where you ofte n have lo
ks or the se t hings, or t he r e ha s 
to be hot c hic ke n soup a nd t he  
Klezmar would come back to play 
and then they ate with
 us a little, but it was 
a difficult, a very  
di ffic ult hol i day for us .  The r e was no joy at all .
  The n ca me Sukkot and 
Sukkot I re me mber ver y 
vivi dly be ca use the  Sukkot( ph)  in our home  wa s bi
g.  The entry to the ap
art me nt was a  ver y bi g 
hallway and it didn™t have
 windows but it had ceilin
g window, there was a 
name fo r it?  Whe n  
there™s a windows in the ce

Q: Sky light? 

A: Sky light.  Ther e was a very bi

a special holiday.  My fa ther wo
uld being in ma ny people fr om

 Once my father  came
 without an Oye (ph) and I remember  ho w 
ups et my mother  was  a n d he had, 
poor ma n, he had t o go ba c k to
 the s ynagogue a n
d fi nd an Oye  
(ph) .  There wer e  al wa ys  
some  poor  people stra nded
.  One Oye ( ph)  I™ll never for get.  It must  ha ve  
been 1938 by then becaus
e he told us that he 
came from Zbaszyn.  Zbas
zyn was  a  pla c e, you know 
about it, to which the Polish Je
ws were thrown by the Germans 
and he some how or ot her , he  
wa nde red and wander ed around, he
 came to Kolomy ja, a long wa y 
fr om Zbonsheen, which was on  
the Zbaszyn border and he be
gan to tell us a little bit 
about what ha
ppened.

But I thi nk it  was hus hed over i n some  way, at l
east  I don™t re me mber det ails .  I reme mber  that Oye  

(ph) .  Anot her ste ady one, e ver y Sukkot-bot ( ph) 
was the matchmaker in 
town.  My si sters got  
married by matchmaker, th
r ough a matchmaker .  The matchmaker , 
he was treated very well, but he 
always  sai d, he™s  not going to eat , he j ust c a me for 
Kiddish.  But, to eat yo
u had to wash your hands  
so he re fuse d to wa sh hi s ha nds  be c ause he onl y 
ca me for Kiddis h.  So t he Kiddis h wa s a lot of 
appetizer s, t hree or four appetizer
s, a nd a l ot of s wee ts a nd he wa
s not eating, but he came, ever y 
Sukkot-bot ( ph) he ca me beca use  
my fat her  ha d daughter s to mar r
y off.  And he kne w t here  would 
be money t h ere so al l my sister s mar r ied ______
________ a nd when it c a me
 to me , he looke d me  
over.  Th e coming of age, he no
ticed my body, that it was getting 
ready for marri age.  He started  
looking at me more  ser i ousl y, but I  esca pe d hi m.
  So I ne ver mar r ied through a matchma ker , I  
mar r ied my hus ba nd, ver y independ
ent wi fe.  But  the mat chmaker 
wa s at our s ha bba t table e ver y 
Sat urda y wit hout eating.  I always
 laughed because he ate aboutthr ee appetizers you know.  The 
Jewish fo od was gef
ilte fish and it was pi
tché and it was some
thing else, chopped 
liver, three, four 
appetizer s and he ate all  of them
 wit hout wa shi n g his ha nds , whic h 
me a ns he di dn™t  eat .  We all  
laugh about it, we still reme
mber the shabbat and 
they all went intothe ovens.  But, 
this was part of

my  childhood which I resisted to a

mixed up mixt ure , but  go a hea d. 
Q: Did you l oose the littl e accent that
 you ha d when you fi rst we nt to 
school, so instead of speaking 
Poli sh?  
A: Yes.  My Poli sh is fi ne.  I lo
st t he accent and I must 
have made some sor t of silent det er mi nati o n  
that I™ m goi ng t o beat t hem at i t
.  My Poli sh s a ve d my li fe  in

suspiciously at me and I knew 
he was s uspecting be caus e I look 
Je wish, I woul d open my

bec aus e I  spoke ver y  good Polis h. 
Now my Pol ish ain™t  s o good
.  But  my  Ger ma n i s better 
now, a ma zingly s o.  Ye s. 
Q: You we nt  to Uni versit y i n 1936?  

A: 1936 I  entered 
Uni ver sity again. 
Q: And how did that happen, wa
s  thi s usual for young wome n?  
A: No , n ot at all.  Ve ry  fe w, th ere wa s n o
 gymnasi um for Je wish women, t here  wa s onl y the  

gymnasi u m wit h the nuns, the Ursula
nki nuns ra n a Ca tholic, high sc
hool for Catholic girls a nd all  
Poli sh girl s wer e Cat holi c.   

 

01: 48: 09 

 

So t here wa s not hing for me but 
t h at when my  parents together wit h nine ot her s created t he  

gy mn asi u m.   I ca me  to  th
e University, I certainly wa nted to go to Univer sity and I want ed to st udy 
Poli sh lit erat ure, t her e was no questi on about what 
I wanted to study.  I wa
s the youngest at home, 
the onl y one  at home .  M y sist ers wer e marrie d by 
the n.  And l i ved a way.  So for t he m,  the l ose  of 

their mezunka,the youngest
 is  the  mezunka , us ua lly 
the favorite child in ma
ny Je wi sh fa mi l i es , but  
with me it was doubly so.  They 
were ext r e mel y unha ppy a bout it, 
t he y  wouldn™t hear about it. 
We ll, how c oul d I make my pare nts h
ear me  thi s  wa y?   I we nt  on a hu
nger strike .  For my pare nts, a  
child woul dn™t eat , was the greates
t  tragedy.  They could not st
a nd my, they couldn™t stand t he  
separ ation fr om me , I suppose .  
The y worrie d about a girl goi ng 
a wa y to a big cit y , what wil l

happen to her?  They worried 
about kashr ut , where will  I  eat 
t here?   And t he y worried about 
themselves, I™m sorry, 
I™ m sur e  t he y coul dn™t  fa c e  ea ch ot her  
all alone.  All  the si ster s were gone 
and they were still young people but 
they felt as if they felt old.  So
 my father ma de a decision to go 
to his Rabbi.  At that time the Rabbi didn™t come 
to us anymore.  He was old and he didn™t tra vel , I  
suppose. He lived some where near 
Sigit, somewhere very 
far, it was Roma nia at 
t hat point.  And t o  
go t o Roma nia fr om Pol and you nee ded pas sport s 
by t he n, you nee ded visa
s, you ne ede d for eign 
currency, it was both th
e  Polish gove rnment  and t h
e Roma ni a n gove rn
me nt ma de it v e ry
 difficult.  
But my father found a way 
and he went to t he Rabbi .  To consu
lt with him, what to do about thi s  
stubborn, little dau
ghter.  So the Rabbi, in hi
s wisdom, I doubt if his ex
perience was questioned, he 
said, i f she i s as smart as
 a boy, you treat her as 
i f  she  were a boy, send he
r to st udy.  Fat her c a me 
bac k and I went t o st udy.  And t hat i s t he st ory on
 how I we nt to study.  
M y pare nts out fi tted me  an d 
I was always outfitted for ev
ery occasion, and I went 
to live off and they ma
de arrangements with a 
distant relative to house me.  Sh
e was in Boughf, Le mb erg.  She 
was  mar r ied t o a  ma n who didn™t  
make a living, the name 
was Fisch, so there was hidden po
verty, a little hidden 
poverty.  I had a 
small r oom t here, kept ex
tremely well for me.  Th
e woma n worked ver y ha r
d, agai n, I had a lot o f  
pain bec aus e  she tre ate d me exc epti o nally.  I had to
 ha ve t he best me at a n
d the best food a nd t hey 
ski mped a nd it wa s ver y pa
inful for me to look at all these th
ings .  But t h at™s how it wa s and s he  
was getting 100 zlotys
 a month, which in those 
days was much money, an
d the whole fa
mily lived 
off it.  There wa
s one daughter, a 
little younger than I.  So this
 was what they 
lived off.

The fir st da y, I get out fitt ed, my ne w out fit , and I 
go to t he Universit y and I™
m small and I look very 
young.  I look much young
er than my seventeen an
d a half years, I looked
 a little childish in a way. 
Q: Ho w old  wer e  yo u?  

A: Seve nte e n and a hal f .  Close t o ei ghte en, in fa
ct, when the Rabbi, when 
he marri ed me later he 
wondere d whether my fa ther was te

But , I  come to the  Uni versit y,

it looke d so big.  It looke d so tre me n dous and her e  in fr ont of the big door stand two Polish goons  
and Ende ki, Poli sh Fa sci sts.  And 
t h ere are big poster s in fr ont of 
t he door sa ying, t h is is a we ek 
wit hout Je ws.  Thi s, as I  re me mber , is Oct obe r,
 1936.  A we ek wit hout 
J ews, I don™t  under sta nd 
what t hey™re talki ng about, so I™ m tr ying to get 
t hrough and I  see they™re 
hosti le faces.  Anyway, I  
came t o my classr oom a
nd I recal l they wanted me
 to sit down on t he l e ft 
benches.  Th
e classrooms 
wer e ver y bi g, at l east t o  the e yes of the young gi
rl fr om a s m all town, and they arr anged t hat al l 
Poli sh st ude nts were to s it on the right side and the 
Jewi sh st udent s we re to 
take the ghetto be nches ,  
the left si de.  Before I we nt to the m, I already ha
d some i n for m ation fr om 
the Jewish-Polish society 
of students, and they to
ld me about it, and they told me Je
wish students will not
 take the left  
benches, the ghetto benches, but we
 will stand.  So I look
ed for the Jewish st
udents, there was no 
body else , I  wa s the onl y Je
wi sh st udent .  And t o the ri ght  s i
de we re a b out , 200 per haps, Polis h 
students and I™m the little th
ing standing at the 
door.  To cut it short, for th
e next three ye
ars, I stoo d 
at that door.  I took all my Univ
ersi ty classes i n  the sta ndi ng po
sition.  I never sat down.  It was 
getting worse every day.  There were
 weeks without Jews, there were
 special treatment of Jews. 
The profess ors were unbelie vabl y a nti-se me tic .  The pr ofe ss ors stood a n d they c oul d see around, 

they were a little high on the p
odium, and it was a requi
rement of each studen
t to hand over the 
indexes, it was a little book 
in which you would put a 
signature that 
you had attended classes, we 
had to ha ve  that t o attend e ver y 
class in Polish literatu
r e.  And a s I put , a nd he  would pa use  at t he  
end of the se ssion, he would put hi
s si gnat ure .  One of the m, Pr ofes so
r Tasycki, he was t he expert i n  
the Polish language, not literature
, but language for say, phonic
s.  He saw my
 name, Matylda  
Hirs ch, he took a l ook, he  
threw it at the fl oor.

And the student s appla u ded.  I do
n™t know what ma de me  go bac k.  
I j ust don™t know.  It was sheer 
anger, I suppose.  Or sheer suk
kot me of goi ng home without  fi nis hing 
it.  I was so defenseless.  I

was in such a fright
.  Everyday, I would literally 
vomit with anxiety, of ente
ring that University.  At 
one point , they pushe d me and the y pushed me do
wn a nd s o mething I held on that I didn™t brea k my  
body.  One poi nt I re me mb

his me mory be bles se d.  The sa

Je wish , wha t ever it wa s.   He was a very fa mo us  
profe ssor, a n expert on
 the fa mous poet , J ulius  
Slowa cki .  His na me was Julius Kl eine r, a nd it was th

some unders tandi ng of the in
fluenc e of Fre ud on li teratur e .  To me
, it was al l very ne w.  But he wa s  
extremely prestigious lecturer of
 Polish literature, particularly 
about Slowacki.  
And he saw me , 
every time, sta

oorway, all alone, as I was very insi
gnificant little look
ing, very small.  
One da y, he  mo ve s from his ka tedr
a, all the way down 
t o the door way, I t hou
ght he was walki ng 
out , he  takes  me  under  hi s ar m, he bri ngs me up t o
 the  podi um a nd he  as ked me  to ta ke the c hair .  
We ll!  I refused to take the chair.  I just stood,  he finished his lecture ,
 as he wal k ed down, the  
student s thre w e ggs at hi m.  Luck
y they di dn™t t hr ow stones .  Many ti
mes, they carried stones.  Most 
of the ti me, by the way, he was la

lost contact.  
The Endecki would

 you call it?  Sticks?  With

Q: Maria, we were talking abou
t the three, it wa s three years, 
in Lvov, fo ur years before you 
graduate d?  

A: It wa s four ye ars , bu
t the fo urth year the Russians were 
there and the Uni ver
sity has changed 
totally by then. 

Q: Let me ask you a little bit about 
the three years.  Wh at gave you 
the strength to go to school, I 
me an, tal ki n g a bout t hrowing up e ver yda y be fo
re you go, I me an, was 
e xtra ordi nar y st re ss!  
A: I did not throw up e v er
yday but I fel t  na use ous and I thr e
w up occa si onall y, but t he naus ea was  
part of the a nxiet y.  I fel t  some sense  of resi sta n
ce, that I cannot leave. 
 The Je wis h orga niza tion 
helped us to a large extent beca
use I kne w thi s was  happening t o 
other st ude nts too.  The  thing that  
mobilized my anger ra
ther tha n my a nxiet y was a  funer al of 
a  student i n t he me dical s t udie s.  He  
was literally killed in the classroo
m.   His name just es
capes me, I wish I c
ould remember
, but he 
wa s a close friend of a man who 
l ater beca me  my husba n d.  This
 wa s a tr e me ndous  funeral ,  
some where or ot her , I fe lt th
is solidarity of people and I wasn™t 
alone.  It was very unfortunate that  
in the study of Polis
h lit erature I was the onl y Jew and that  f
eel ing of is olati on wa s the worst part of 
all of i t .  But  the n, I  suddenly fo
und mysel f  in t ha t  proces sion of 
hundre ds of st ude nts  a nd I got thi s  
sens e of stre ngt h fro m the nu mber

the m the s t ory of what wa s goi ng on.  I recal l , 
they woul d bring bac k the  big, bi g pots  and pans 
when I came because for th
emselves, they were on  
diets , and the cooking was ver y li mit ed, s o whe n 
I came there were again 
celebr ations.  There was  
some joy in the hous
e again.  I t hink it was i n 
my , let me see, it was in 
my thi r d year  of st udi es,  
second or t h ird, I  ca n™t re me mber
, that I went to the library to
 pick up a Polis h book a nd th e  
librarian told me that the book was 
j u st che cke d out.  I sa id, who to
ok it?   She sai d, 
this man, this 
young stude nt.  I walk over to t he 
st ude nt and I say, I nee d t his book.  He says, he wants t o read i t  
too.  And I said, are yo
u a student of Polish litera
ture?  He say, no, he st
udies pharmacology, the 
medical school.  So I sa
id, but I™m a student of Polish literature
 and I need the bo
ok for an exam. 
He sa ys , wel l , you're quit e stubbor n a bout it.  I say, ye
s, please help me with it.
  We started talking .  
He was fr om my home town, I neve

His parents had a apothe keter (ph), phar mac y and 
everybody kne w the phar m

, we beca me  love rs.  And this  
cha nge d my life i m me dia t ely.  I wa

my father was ver y unha ppy when I 
declare d I wa nted t o ma rr y hi m.
  Beca use hi s fa mil y, unlike my 
own, was e xt r e mely assi mila ted t o t h e exte nt t hat
 I think t hey would eat 
on Yom Kippur, whic h wa s  
unusual.  They carried it  to an 
ext r e me .  His fat her wa s for generati ons , they had tha t  phar mac y .  
They prided themselves in being extremel y 
assi milate d Jews .  Well agai n, i n my us ual  
stubbor nness , my par ents  had to gi

went t o the chedet toget h er with 
this  ma n who ha d a fe w cla ss es there ,
 s o t hey pat che d it up in some  
way and they came and th
ere was an engageme nt.  It was 1938
 or 1939.  We beca me engage d and 
my l i fe natur ally changed because I 
wasn™t al one, he was just a bout 
to fini s h his st udy, I  had a not her  
two years t o go. That  summer ..

Q: Tell me  wh en you met? 
A: I met him, I 
thi nk it was 1938, t w o ye ars a fter .  
Q: Was he your first ma n? 

A: My fir st boyfriend.  Well, I ha

I ha d a boy t hat, my pare nts ar rang

wa s al wa ys cha perone d.  And I re me mber a c r us h 
on a young man who wa s later kill ed.  And t hi s 
wa s my fi rst  crush, but my fir s t 
intimate relationship was this boy
, my fiancee, Nunek Najder .  It 
wa sn™t  enga ged real ly, we sta rted 
livi ng together i n a  way, ye s. 

Q: What att r acted you to
 hi m, do you think?  
A: He loved Polish literature and yet he was in a di
fferent profession, so definitely yes, he was very 
assimilated and I 
al ways  struggle d wi th t his t hi ng, you k
now?  We had a lot in common because of 
Poli sh lit erat ure.  And we  belonge d 
to the Jewish Student Association, 
li fe c hange d.  I wasn™t al one.  
And I think, my later years,
 being al one was a real tragedy.  Wh
e n I was hidi ng, later .   But, Nune k  
wa s e xtre me l y a ffecti ona te with me , e xtre mel y de vote d
 to me .  We just seemed to be the right kind 

of a coupl e, bot h young, he was t w

wer e al ways celebr ations about it .

One da y, for  a long vaca tion one s u mm
er we de cide d to go into th

much int o hi king.  Until a fe w ye ars ago I was into
 it.  And he too.  This wa s the maj or sport for  
ma ny young, Je wis h pe ople.  He di dn™t bel ong t o 
an or ga niz ation, he wa s the as si mil ated s ort of

beca me  e xtre mel y

 go to a new, brand ne

highest mountains on the Carpatian 
Mountains, this was called the C

  Hard to get there, 
after a point  we were ab

wa s one mor e coupl e fr om Wars a w, Poli sh pe opl e. 
 And I recall the distance 
we had fr om them and, 
we were t he onl y four pe ople , ver y fa r awa y.  No

long hist ory of assi mil ate d Je ws.  But  somehow or 
the othe r, t hey se ns ed i t .  So although we ate  
together, there was a sense of dist

remember.  We ll, it wa
s a great  experience, to be all  alone i n
 t his stunni ng part  of the mount ains,  
this is above Bor-a uk- na (ph) , Bor - auk- na ( ph)  
was a vill age and fr om 
t here we went to t h e 
Chomiak.  Later on, 
Chomiak became a popul ar 
place.  When the vacat ion 
was over , i t  was t he 1st 
of Septe mber, 1939.  Vaca
tion was over, we went back to the villa
ge to take the train to Kolomyja.  
It was a Sunda y a fter noon, we 
sa w ma ny, no, don™t re me mber 
why I t hink it was a Sunda y, I  
thought it was Sunday becau
se many Ukrai nian peas
ant s were tryi ng to re
ad post ers.  When we 
came t o t he post ers, it was a Declar
at ion of War.  That  Ger ma ny has  
just declared war  on Poland.  I t  
wa s Sept e m ber 1st, 1939.  Shows  
you how t ota lly unpr epa r ed we we
re for it .  Pe
ople lived in 
Wa rsaw, no t the cities, kn ew mu ch mo re.  We seem
ed to ha ve  be en tota
lly isolated fr om it,  
partic ularl y when we we re up i n 
t he mountains t h ere for many weeks. 
Q: Were you aware of wh at 
was going on in Germa ny? 
A: We kne w  a little, wha t  wa s go
ing on i n Ger ma ny, it was Nazi Ge
r many.  We didn™t know how 
much i mpact  the y ha d on 
our , on Polis h st udent s.

Act uall y, wh en I later stu d
ied it, the tactics of the 
Poli sh st ude nts were c ut  
out of t e xt books fr o m  
the Nazi literature.  We  
didn™t know enough.  Wh
en you lived in 
the western part of Poland you 
certainly knew more about it.  You 
di dn™t, I didn™t , and my hus b and di
dn™t know either
.  But  I recall 
that da y, l ate r in t he  a fter noon, 
I don™t  know why I  thi nk i t  was  Su
nda y, the onl y re ason t hat I  thi nk  
so is t hat when peasant s  just be all t oget her i n 
the cent er of t he squar e.  
We  read this, we didn™t

really r ealize the i mpor t ance of it
.  We  were Polish patriots, stra
ngel y e nough.  Bot h of us had  
military preparation, I had it in 
my high school days. 
 All boys and all girl
s had to have military 
preparati on.  Which meant we wer e
 taught how t o wear uni f or ms, 
how t o marc h.  He ha d to be 
taught, I™m sure, how to shoo
t.  I wasn™t, but  to mar ch i n para de s 
and t o ma r c h i n c a se  of a war .  We  
kne w al l the se thi ngs , the r e wa s, forgot the na me
, Pol ski n, gos h how could I 
remember, forget these 
names, anyway it was war preparati o
n, that ever y high s chool s t ude nt 
had t o partici pate i n .  We took 
the train and we thought perhaps 
we™ll  go int o the war, perhap
s we™ll march, 
we just  di dn™t  
underst and a ny of it .  When I ca
me ho me I s a w the gl oo m o n my 
par e nt s fa ce , the y kne w more. 
The y had pa rticipat ed i n World War I  and t he y kne
w t hat war is not onl y s
ongs a nd ma rches .  This  
wa s Se ptember 1st, 1939.  Within 
we eks , the Rus sian ar my move d in
.  I di dn™t know t h en, but t here  
wa s a pact bet wee n Ribintrope (
ph)  and Molot o v (ph) a nd t hey dec lare d  that Poland shoul d be  
divi ded.  Our part of Pol and fell t o
 the Sovi ets.  This wa
s within two or three 
weeks that the Soviet  
ar my marc hed in.  I re me mber the ni ght whe n the y 
marched i n.  It wa s ve ry, wha t  wa s  the word for  
it?   The s ong sounde d very attr
active, it was me smerizing.  They
 were mar chi ng a n d their songs  
were beautiful, I still remember th
eir songs.  And I was 
very much pulled so
mewhat or other, I 
always  was  l i beral , I  was  al ways poor .  M any of t h
eir i deas, it  seemed t hat
, they were bring s o me  
e mployme nt  and di gni ty to the poor people .  But ,
 on t he ot he r hand, I c o uld se e from my pare nts  
expr essi on t hat the y we r e  worr ied a n d we di dn™ t kno
w wh at the futu re wo uld 
be , so it wa s strong.  I 
remember di stinctl y t hat  night wh
en they marched in and I recall th
e song, they sang
 these songs,  
for some  rea son.  Well , we  went  ba
c k t o Lvov to study. 
 My husband wa s j ust 
finis he d t hen, I  thi nk.

Q: Can you sing on
e of t h e songs?

A: Gosh, [singing], oh, I 
can™t reme mber anymore.  If tomorrow
 is war, we will 
defe nd Stalin and 
everywhere we will be the victor
s.  So, it had a mesmerizing qualit
y for some reason because I was 
in conflict.  But I di
d go back to finish 
my st udie s .  The Uni ve r sity was 
totally di ffer ent by then.  By 
the way, I was married by, this 
wa s 1940, I was just married by 
then.  Well, come
 ba ck to my  
we ddi ng for  a mi nut e, it  was alre ady a very quie t  wedding.  I never want ed a we ddi ng in a whit e  
gown, I  was  a very fe mi nist kind 
of a woma n, li beral ki
nd of a wo me n.  I wa s 
not interested in all 
these trappings of the bou
rge oisi e, which was ver y much t he ba
d and good pa rt of
 my bac kgr ound,  
mai nly  t hro u gh my  mot h er.

So I always dreame d that I™ll just escape with 
my hus ba nd or I™ll ha ve a very s ma ll weddi ng, but  
anyway when the time came it wa s, the So viets had 
just come in at that 
point a nd I wa s marrie d, I  
can™t re me mber the mont h which is insane , but I kno
w it wa s 1 940 .  It was t he year wh e n I was ju st  
about t o gra duat e.  The  Ra bbi  of 
o ur  to wn  was  a  close  frie nd  o f my
 fat her , Ra bbi  Lowe (ph).  Hi s 
nephew is the chief Rabbi of Isr
ael now.  The ot her ne phe w wa s 
chief counsel of 
Israel for New 
York, the United State s, I knew bot h of the m, I  me
t them later.  But that Rabbi questioned my  
fat her , he sai d, you say s he™s  of age 
t o marr y?   She looks li ke a chi l d.
  I just happened
 to look very 
young.  So the outfit for 
my wedding was 
a nice little navy su
it and flat-heel shoe
s and a little veil, I 
think.  The we ddi ng wa s in our  own apart me nt  i n ou
r pare nts  home .  Ther e we
re har dl y any gue sts , 
the Soviets had just come 
in and t he business was already ta ke n over
 by the Soviets.  My father kept  
sayi ng t hat he c a nnot gi ve me  
muc h  a dowry be caus e of the  wa r, bec aus e the  Sovi et s ha ve t ake n  
over everything, but after the war 
he will reimburse me fo
r it, I™ll get more do
wry than any of the 
other girls , a nd all t he gir l s got good 
dowries.  And I didn™t 
think of a dowr y at all,
 to me this was all 
very uni nter esting.  All I  re me mber 
t hat, t he day of the weddi ng, la
ter we took the 
t rai n and went  
back to study and, in Re-volf (p
h), and sitting on the train I wore th
at wedding band 
and he did too  
and a Polish woman sits
 there across fr om us, she says, t hes
e  days chil dr en have suc h a way of

lying.  You wea r  we ddi ng bands , you're both c hil
dren!  He looke d ver y y
oung too, str ange as it all  
sounds now.  But we fi ni she d our studies a nd t he Uni ver sity was a to
tal l y different i nstit utions.  The  
Soviets  ha ve  cha nge d it t otally.  Wh
ile anti-Semiti
sm was somewhat there, it 
certainly was there, it 
was not offi cial but ther e are no mo re Jewish 
st ude nts i n my de part me nt.  I mea n, t here wa s no 
que stion i n what I  mixe d 
with ot her s.  What I  r
ecall was extremely cold 
wi nter  of 1940.  The  
Soviets suddenly did not  have a
ny s t ea m anymor e, everyt hing wa s jus t  ta ken a w ay, including the  
steam,  how they managed 
that I don™ t know.  But  whatever  they
 c oul d put  their  eyes on was  ta ke n  
back to Russia.  I recall 
going to t he opera house, 
we we re involved 
in ope r a, a nd se
eing the Russian 
ladies  in ni ghtgowns  bec ause  they
 thought the se wer e e ve ning gowns, 
and I recal l  i n 
our , when the y  
took our st or e the y re mo ved eve r yt hi ng s o my fat h
er sti ll re move d s o me di
shes for bartering later  
whi ch he lpe d us for a l ong ti me
.  The  Soviets  nati onalize d t he 
store , actuall y loc a l pe opl e wh o 
became communist, who we
re c o mmunist , but now be ca me very i m
portant official s, they came t o 
help the Soviet soldiers to nation
alize the store.  For my
 father it was a terrib
le tra gedy beca use t o  
hi m the busi ness was hi s  life t o a 
ve ry large exte nt and s uddenly 
he wa s  wit hout anything.  The 
same happened t o my father-i n-
la w, his ________ was al so nationa
li zed by the Sovi e t s.  To the se 
people , t hey suddenl y be ca me old,
 and t hey were  really not ol der 
at t hat  point  but ever ythi ng was  
take n away from them, they 
felt.  So, t he s t udy was  ve
r y di ffer e nt.  I ha d my final  e xa ms ,  the y had  
to be in the Russian language.  
We all had to study fr om the green
 book, I remember
 under my ar m, 
and e ver y st ude nt ha d it under thei r ar m, ever y Univ
ersity student has this 
green book.  Very cheap 
paper in gre en c over , it wa s call ed t he korr- up-ti k 
qual for Bolshovi tski  Part y (ph), whi ch me ans  
The  Shor t Cours e of the Bol shevi
k Party and was full of propaganda 
which I didn™t realize at  that 
ti me that i t  wa s pr opa ga nda , but it was about St al
in and it was about the Re
vol ution.  One chapt er I 
liked very much was the Marxist 
dialectic philosophy, it 
was very well written.  
It seemed to have  
some , no, a ctuall y t he Ha galie n ( p
h) dialec tic phil osophy, it made
 s ense.  It ha d some  larg e  
expr essi ons t o be a lot of propag
anda.  But we ha d to study eve r y 
pa ge a nd e very word of it and t he  
fi nal exam, wh en they examined me
 in Polish literature, I had to 
talk in Russian.  I mastered the  
langua ge ver y qui ckl y.  I  for got it ver y qui ckl y to
o, you know I hardl y know a ny.  But this was a

year i n Re-vol f (ph), t he fi nal 
year .  I wa s a ne wl y we dde d woma n, 
my par ents wer e de pres sed ove r  
what ha ppened, what wa s 
goi ng on, t hey we re for e ver fe are d t h
at they ma y be deporte d, t hat th e  
Russia ns would de port  the m. 
 At  one poi nt, t he y a c tuall y woul d 
g o  ho me  fro m ti me  to ti me , a t  o n e  
poi nt the y ca me t o take my pare nts a w ay.  The y alwa
ys did it in the middle of
 the night .   They were  
classi fi ed as  bourge ois  a nd t his 
wa s a ver y bad c erti ficati on a nd, 
in the middle of the night they 
ca me al wa ys  with t heir ri fle s, ri fl ing a t  the door .  
We al way s  wer e  a frai d.  An
d they took them to the  
railway station to take th
em to Siberia.  I recall 
I was home at  that poi nt a
nd my si ster s was home  at  
that poi nt , and we ra n to the rail way st ation.  It was  
a lot of bribes to get them
 back home.  I wish we  
didn™t, but  t hat™s what happene d.  The bribe s we re
 al wa ys vodka and c hof- soc ks ( ph).  Chof- socks  
(ph) wer e watche s, t hey love d watc hes.  The S
oviets ha d absolutely not hi
ng, it™s unbeli eva ble, how  
they t ook everythi ng, ta ken bac k to Russia .  For 
the first ti me they s a w goods , whic h t hey have n™t  
seen.  We didn™t realize how the 
revolution had changed 
life there in those politics in poverty,  
unle ss a mong the  hi ghe st  officia l s, I s uppos e.  So, 
they al ways order ed l eat her coats and when they  
order ed l eat her c oats , t h ey had t o be  to the floo
r  beca us e the y figure d when t he y go bac k and t he 
winter is c ol d, t hey will cut a nd 
ma ke a pair of boots, thi s wa s 
___________.  So, 
chof-socks ( ph)  
and leather coats and our fi ne porcelain, all 
of it went somewhere wi
th the Russian families 
eventuall y back t o Russi a.  Thi s 
was  the Soviet s, but I  fini she d sc
hool a nd then the y di dn™t per mit  
me  to li ve i n Re-vol f ( ph) , di dn™ t per mit me  or
 my husband, because 
we were categorize as 
bourge ois .  And t he Soviet la w was  t h
at i f you were in t his ca tegor y,
 you wer en™t quit e an ani mal  i n 
Soc i alis m but you were s o me where no
t to be tr ust ed s o you ha d to li
ve fi ft y  mi l e s a wa y  fr o m a l a rge  
city.  Ever ybody wa nte d t o live in a la rge city, s o th
ey punishe d us .  Inste a d of taki ng us to Si beria  
like t hey wanted to t ake 
my parent s, who wer e c o nsidere d use l
ess, they fi gured 
t wo young pe ople, 
these professionals, will be useful. 
 So the law was that 
you had to move fi ft y 
miles away from Re-
vol f ( ph) and there wer e these cent ers.  They ha
d a ver y bright ide a, g
ood idea, is to open up 
hospitals and pharmacies in the v
illages of the Polish Ukraine, wh
ich had not hing.  There wa s never  
a school ther e, never a hospit al, never a phar mac
y, and the Soviet s ha d a net wor k of t hese t hings , 
very s mart , t he Pol es never gi ve t he m any cre dit for it.
  But they did, so they opened up a hospital in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
30 
 
a place call e d Glen- na- novari a (ph).  
You neve r heard of it, I never he ard 
of it.  It was a real l oss, it  
was a vill age in wher e t her
e wa s no side wal k.  Whe n 
a trai n, your shoe  got st
uc k ri ght i n the mud.  
It ha d a  na me, mud was a  part  of th
e name, so this is wher
e t he y se nt us  to wo
rk.  My husband, the y  
wanted to open a phar macy, how di d they open a  phar mac y?   They t ook from t he Rus sian churc h, 
fr om the parochial house,
 they took the house an
d the y ope n ed a pha r ma cy.  My hus band ope ned 
the phar macy and me, t h ey wanted 
t o  teac h i n sc hool  and, bec ause  
I wasn™ t pre par ed
 to teac h young 
children, I was prepared to teach at gymnasium,
 I had a M asters De gre e 
by then, my gis-t r of- o-
sovi sia ( ph)  whi ch was a  high Degree
.  So I wa s not versed 
in hi gh school  or anyt
hing, so they said I 
could be an assistant 
to my husband.  
I learned how to make ca-g
o-cheekie (ph), was a little  
me dicat ion a gainst hea da ches .  And 
I  wo uld  wra p it.  Very  o f te n at
 ni ght  we heard the m, hear d t he  
Soviet  sol die rs knock at t he door 
wit h  the  ri fle .  E ach t i me we  wer e
 prepared they wo
ul d ta ke us  to 
Siberia.  What they wa nt ed were condoms .  In th
e mi ddle of t he night, t he y woul d rifl e  at the door  
for c ondoms .  This was 1940.  I thought we  wer e lucky t o have 
jobs, we  ha d e nough food.  Ther e  
wer e  thre e J e wi sh fa mi li es, us, 
a Je wis h doct or fr om Ger ma ny 
wh o was  so me ho w 
or other ca me  
there and opened a hospi tal, i t was 
all  public  wor k s, and a  Je wi sh t e
ac her  fr om Ha-r iza  ( ph) .  That™s  
where all your Ukrainian peasants
, everybody was illiterate there, ab
solutely illiterate. 
 So the three 
of us , some t i me s the y pl aye d cards, I  was re adi n
g books al wa ys, but a nywa
y, one day we we nt to  
vacati on and my father, you know
, was so desperate ab
out  once more t o st
and behi nd a phar macy 
counter .  Once mor e t o be an uppe

 di fficulty, we arra

come t o our place in Glen-na- nova
ri a  (ph) for t w o we eks  va cat ion a nd 
we wo uld go to 
their home in 
Kolomyja.  It took us a lot of wo

ll , it  ha ppe ne d.  We  went ther e ,  

home, we stayed in their home 
for two weeks and my father and 
mother-in-law went to our little  
place and t o ok over t he phar macy t o  the greatest  j

aft er t wo weeks vacati ons we wer e 
suppose to go back.  A
nd it  was t he 21st  of June, 1941, and you  
know t he re st of the stor y.  We di dn
™ t  expe ct any of it .  We s aid 
good-bye to my parents, we had 
railway tickets to go the next day 
ba ck to Re- vol f ( ph) a nd fr om ther
e by hor se and carri age to go to 
Gle n-na-novaria (ph) a nd, in the middle of the ni ght,
 I hear a l ot of noi se .  
I look out of the wi ndow,

it was one in the morning, I se
e Soviet wome n and chil dre n be
i ng put  on tr uc ks.  I woke  my 
hus ba nd, I s ay, t hey mus t  be goin

t it seemed to be so
 nois y a nd s o many 
trucks, middle of the night.  I 
opene d the r adi o and he re Hit l e
r™s voi ce comes acr oss.  Today I  
declar ed war  on Bolshevi sm and the 
J e ws.  And I kne w t hings wer e  ve
r y ba d.  The first t hing in t he  
morni ng, we ran to the railway stati on to get to th
at place.  The trains di d not run anymor e.  Not hin g 
for civilians.  We were stuck in
 Kolomyja, his parents 
were stuck in that l
ittle hole.  Two weeks 
later we got  a car d, t he y were bot h shot .  The 
Germans walked into th
e phar macy, they were 
renounced as Jews and t hey
 were s h ot.  This wa s  the e nd of my
 hus band™ s par ents .  We  were stuck 
in Kolomyja and first the Hungarians ca me to cove
r our cit y.  I remember 
t hem wearing these very  
high hats  wi th fe athe rs.  The y didn™t do muc h har m
 at t hat poi nt yet.  So
mehow or  ot her I r ecall  a  
truck of c hil dren, a truc k with chi l dre n.  I had 
no idea who t hese childr en 
were, but the children, the 
truck was c o vere d but you could hear  cries.  We 
were living then at the 
home of my pare nts a nd I 
re me mb er my fathe r  sai d  to me a nd my siste r , 
my sister had run a wa y 
from Nova-som (ph), fro m 
the wester n part where t he Ger man
s had been alr eady for t wo year s,
 sh e c a me to  o ur ho me  to w n.  
And t he Rus sians  first  were lookin
g for her t o send her to Siberia 
but anyway she got
 out of it and  
the Hungarians were 
there and my father said, br
ing the children a little hot 
water, it was a cold day. 
So  we r un  wit h a  chi na  o f hot  wate r an d we  he ar
 the whi m per of t he child

come .  The y  wer e dir ecte d at us, 
at my sist er a nd mysel f .  I r e me mb
er we threw this hot water, the 
china, on the sidewalk.  
This was my first confront
ation with real terror.  
But the Hungarians by and 
way were pretty innocent 
at  the beginning, a l eas
t we didn™t know.  Wi
thin a fe w weeks, the 
Ger ma ns ma rche d in.  And now I know from hist ory bu
t t hos e days I di dn™t know tha t  right i n the  
back of the soldiers
 came  the SS.  They alwa
ys  we re out and we di dn™t  know t he  di ffere nce bet w een  
an SS and a soldi er and everyt hing
 ha s been bla me d on the SS but I now know t hat the s oldier s wer e  
indistinguisukkotble fr om the SS 
because they participated as mu
ch.  But anyway, everyday there 
was a new directive, a new post er. 
 Today t he J ews ha ve to regist er
 and toni ght t he J ews ha ve to

fur coats for me, not one but two, duri ng th

i mmensely because t he 
Uni ver sity was so cold an
d I recall t aking cl asses everyday bundled up i n  
that fur coat.  Anyway, w

we all stood in line 
to del i ver t o the  
Germans.  And I recall coming to the wi ndow, the 
Ger man offi cial, and he 
would re gist er my na me 
and a ddr ess and t he fur c oat, t he le ngt h of the fur

.  One was a tweed lined

I figured, well , i f after 
the Wi nter passes I™ll get it

 We k n e w th e Je wi sh do ctor s o

  I leaned out 
of the window, 
this was 1940 in Kolomyja and it 
wa s a sukkotrp, cool morning and 
I felt a terrible pain in my 
breast, i n my lungs, my chest . 
 And wit hin a fe w hours, t he doctor

husband came back immediately,
 my father-in-law who still 
knew a lot about

anyway, they got together.  Sulfur

at that  point  
wa s i f  you li ved se ve n days , I  was  
pretty much unconsci ous wit h an

pne u mo nia .  Al mo st the wh ole t o wn wa s inv olv e d 
in my pne umonia.  The three doct ors were da y

  Their names I do reme
mber, Dr. Tye-s ukkot ( p h)
, Dr . Fry- gar (ph) and 
Dr . Flei sh (ph), all thr ee 
of them.  When I got well, and I reco
vere d prett y quic kly I wa s young, and  
my mot her t ook good car e 
of me , I recovered, they 
insisted that the town s
hould see me.  The y t oo k  
a fee - ak- a (ph), and- dros h-ki nd (ph) and a pai r  of 
horses and here were the three doctors with me  
and we t raveled across the cit y so
 eve r ybody kne w I  was  tr ul y ali ve . 
 In t hos e days, you di dn™t  pic k  
up a phone [to call anyone].  ____
_________ beca use 
I would l i ke the na me s of the se doctors t o be  
remembered somehow or anot
her, they were all killed.  Dr. Flei
sh™s (ph) daughter
 went to school 
with me, gymnasium, is still alive 
in Stockholm.  So co ming back
 to the German times, this I 
re me mb er, f a mou s  d oct o r s were  in
 that aux- own- der ( ph)  be i ng dr
a gge d.  We didn™t know whe r e 
people were  being dra gged, there we re all kinds 
of rumors.  Later we 
found t hey we nt, dr agged  
outsi de of t own to a forest call e
d Sukkotp- a-r oth-s a (ph) and t hey
 we re sh ot ther
e.  They had 
machi ne guns there.  There were 
all kinds of rumo rs that they 
we nt some w here but some where or  
other it bega n to bother us that per ha p s really t he r u
mors t hat t hey wer e kill ed were true.  We di dn™t  

quite want to believe it.  Every 
few weeks t here was another action.
  One a very sad one was a moc-
row-sea t  (ph), a ver y poor neighborhood whe re th
ey dra gged out all t he Je ws a nd for s o me rea son 
they focused on the m a n d the n there  were , food 
wa s alrea dy begi nni ng t o  be rationed, there was  

little food.  And in 1942, 
it was Passover, 19
42, when the posters on th
e wall announced that all  
Je ws ha ve t o  go t o t he ghetto. 

Q: Can I ask you a little bit ab
out part of this period? 
A: Yes .  

Q: Fir st of al l, you c oul dn™t go

 We  stayed with my

Q: Di d you t alk t ogethe r  abou
t what happening or wh ether? 
A: Yes, we were very, very worried.  We could 
see what wa s going on.  
We  be ga n to, well, we  
never sa w that all be kill ed, t his was very har d.  
Some of us woul d dis appe a
r, we thought, the way 
they di d.  Pe ople  tal ked a
bout the fa ct that th
e se Je ws  were tak e n 
to the Ukraine, to
 the west-eastern 
part of t he Ukraine t o wo
rk on far ms  and we l atched on to the s e 
stories, we really 
wanted to believe 
that.  Under  no circu mst ance s di d we thi nk t hat it 
woul d lea d to gas  cha mbe
rs .  We  had no ide a, 
when you re ad the me mos t oda y a n
d they said, we knew they were
 going to Trebli
nka, they kne w 
they were going, we di
dn™t know whe r e they we re goi ng, it wa s  a 
fact.  But there were massive raids 
on people .  And s o meti me s there wa
s s hooting right i n fr ont of us 
so we knew that things were 
terribl y bad.  And t here  wa s begi nni ng t o be  ma ssi
ve  st arva t i on.  Pe opl e  
were goi ng hungry, but  
there was always some b
ody who disappeared.  You 
heard some body, a cousi
n, an uncle, some body 
just, just, he was taken away.  
The word, the expression was take
n away and many 
survivors still 
talk this way because we really di dn™ t know t he 
word, we don™t kno
w where they were ki lled, most 
of the time  we  don™t know exactly 
when because taken away is the 
ri ght  expres sion for it  be cause  
all we kne w is we s a w the m disa ppe a r , bei ng ta ke
n away.  The  Ukra inia ns wer e extre m ely invol ved 
with the Germans.  Actua
lly, they were shooting as
 much, t hey were
 roundi ng us  up 
as much.  But  
the round ups, c alle d ax-see- on ( ph) , were t he most 
characteristic part of 
that period.  You were  
afr aid of ax- see-on ( ph)  and you 
wer e be ginning to thi nk a bout hi di
ng pla ces.  It ne ver  occ urre d t o  
us that we woul d dis pers e a mong 
the native population.  
We just didn™t thi n k of it.  Ever ybody kne w  
me , I™ m Ma r i a Heirs h fr o m K olo my
ja , where woul d I go?  
 Then came t he ar m 
ba nds, the 
white arm 
bands  we ha d t o we ar.  The  yellow stars  we ha d 
to wear .  The na me s t h at we  ha d t o ta ke , t he

Ho ro witz .  A Je wis h p o lice wa s 
esta blished, my hus ba nd™ s br other vol unt eered for it beca use you  
fir st thought  you woul
d save Je ws , l ater he was i nvolve d in a
ll kinds, I assume of horrible things , 
although he didn™t wit ne ss the m.  It wa s getti ng 
worse e veryday.  We di dn™
t know what a ghett o 
wa s.  By the wa y, when t he Sovie t s withdre w a nd t h
e Germans were just about 
to c o me i n my fath er 
in strange ways l ooked for ward t o it .  He re me
mbered the Austrians and 
he thought t he Ger ma n s  
wo uld be part of it.  With th
e Russians he couldn™t communi c ate,
 the y t ook a wa y e ver ythi ng fro m 
hi m.  It wa s the Ger ma ns  he favore d since he s p
e a ks Ger ma n and he re me
mbers t his.  Austria t he  
wh ole  while  wa s for t he m  the  be st 
part  of t heir  live s.  Ha mms b urg, 
Au stria  - the  Kais er wa s g oo d t o 
them.  I remember as a ch
ild when the pict ure of Kai ser Franz 
Joseph came down in our living room 
and they hung up t he pi cture  of Ma
r sukkotl l  Pil- sook-s ki ( ph) and 
I was happy about 
it.  And they 
did it for their children, I think.  
But they were very much attached
 t o the Ger man 
language, to th e 
Austrians, so they didn™t think that the Germans 
coul d be s o bad beca use  they real ly didn™t know 
terribl y muc h what wa s goi ng on i n Ger ma n y.  An
d in Ger ma ny t he y didn™t have e xter mi nation 
camps, people immi grated.  We  knew some one fr
om Bonn-shee n (ph) 
but our knowle dge was 
limited.  The Soviets ke pt  the knowledge away to a 
ver y l arge  e xtent  too.  They di dn™t  te ll us  wha t  
wa s going on in western Po land b
eca use t he n the y alre ady ha d s o me c a mps.  The y di dn™t t ell, the  
Russia ns ke pt it very se aled, ve
ry ti ghtl y.  Any ne ws fr om we
stern Ger ma ny where  ma ny Je ws  
lived.  So me  of them escaped du
ring t he Soviet  per i od like  my 
sister did, my  sister Fr ania. 
Q: When the Germans came in and st arted the ax-see-
on ( ph)  a nd you s a w t hin
gs on the  street , e ven 
though you didn™t t hink it woul d be exter mi nati o ns
 beca use  who i f  any c oul
d have  thought of t hat , 
did you se e certai n gr oups or  cer
tain people or were men more 
vulnerable than women did you 
think, or  wer e they go
ing to be the target? 
A: It was mixed, first were men wh
i ch rei n for ce d our false belie fs that t hey wer e ta ken t o wor k.  
Men, to a lar ge extent .  But there was speci al categ
ories taken.  At one point I saw the doctors, then 
ca me so me o f the la wye r s,
 fathers of stude nts wi th whom I we nt
 to school , one of t he m li ve s in  
California still, one is in
 Florida, they both were 
there.  Their fathers were
 lawyers.  Then it ca me 
for some workers, special workers,
 we were tol d t he SS needs th
es e worke rs.  But you could see

sometimes shootin
g in the streets.  Oh, t he chil dr en ca me 
mu ch later and this 
was a r e al awakeni n g 
at that point.  But, th
ere  wer e food l i mita tions, se ve
re food limitations.  We
 were be ginning to be 
quite hungr y, not star ved yet, but h
ungry.  I remember the 
firs t day of Pass over , thi s is in my mi nd  
very much, 1942.  Ther e 
was an announcement that we al l 
had to go to the ghetto and they 
establ ished t hree ghettos and the y a ssi gne d t o us t h e 
ver y poor part of t he c i
ty.  We were  per mitt ed 
to take on carriages, I don™t know 
why they permitted some
 of these carriages s
till, permitted to take  
whatever we could in car
riages.  I remember I to
ok a pillow, we took some
 dishes, a fe
w potatoes, 
that™s all we had.  And we settled 
in that one-room hous
e at the end of the to
wn, it seemed to me, a 
very extr e m ely poor  nei ghbor hood. 
 It wa s pr ett y dar k, it was the  fi
rst _______ at ni
ght .  It must 
have bee n fi ve o™cl oc k in the a fter noon, wa s still
 enough ti me to prepare 
somet hing for dinner .  I 
recall peeli n g potatoes, t he potat oes I  saved.  And 
suddenly I felt sm
oke and I looked around and the 
ghett o was on fire .  And we bega
n to run.  We saw peopl e being 
shot , we s a w houses on fire  
including our own.  We began to r u n, we di dn™t  
know wher e to run, pe ople ar e running we are  
running with them.  They we
r e runni ng to t he ot he r part of the  ghe
tt o.  In t h e other pa rt of the ghetto 
lived my sis t er Fra nia a n d her hus ba nd a nd their  
child.  My hus ba nd st a yed 
behi nd, he want ed t o 
just catch something, still save 
something.  As 
we came there he
 arrived a fe w hours later, I 
re me mber, a nd hi s eyebr ows were 
all  burned a nd he ca me wit h a ha
l f- burned chi cke n.  He c aught a  
chic ken in order t o feel us.  It  was t erribl y bad but
 we left , we were alive.
  An d e a ch 
time these 
things happen, we to
uched our selves and touched 
each other .  We are alive.  This was Passover .  I 
went to my sister™s pl ace, she had 
a small place t h ere.  We all crowde
d in t here, whatever food they 
had we ate i t  toget her .  We late
r found that ma ny pe opl e from t hat
 part, whom they caught , the y  
took them away and that™s all we 
knew, they took them aw
ay.  And most of the 
time they took them 
to sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) 
and sometimes in th
e distance you could hear th
is shooting.  Still, it would 
be some body the y per ha ps shot, t h
e y  obvi ously must ha ve ta ken for 
wor k, by the n they took all of  
the children and fa milies, 
whole famil i es.  This wa
s the a x-se e -on (ph) of Pas sover .  Later on, we 
found out, a nd dre a de d holi days, we  kne w the y wer e
 always were around holidays.  Was easy for 
them to drag all the Jews
.  Finally we  got  a 
lit tle a part me nt a ss i gne d t o us i n that other  part of t h e

ghett o.  One ,  your windows of t hat 
went to the ai r  outsi de, but the in
si de of it was the ghetto.  Very 
small and my husband 
and I got an extremely small, it was a 
little porch and my 
parents got another 
one i n that buildi ng.  Thi ngs wer e get ting wor s
e everyday.  I recall getting up in the morning and  
looking at t h e panor ama of the ghet
to, what it was like.  
Peopl e were l ayi ng, so
me  de a d of typhoid 
fe ver or starvation.  An older 
Jew with a little carriag
e and a horse, which 
we later named the 
Messiah horse, would take
 these bodies on, put th
ese dead bodies on that
 little carriage and drive 
them out of town for burial.  
We call ed the horse the Messi ah hor se because it was t he horse of 
liberati on.  By t hen we fel t  that
 dying, what you call of natural d
eat h, was a blessin
g.  Some of my 
uncles had this death.  I recall 
these bodies in the littered ghetto, th
ey were littering the ghetto.  I 
recall sometimes getti
ng up the morning and seei ng 
dist orte d fa ces hanging on the str e et lanter ns.  
And these di storte d fac es  so
meti me s I sa w the fa
ce of a teacher, of a rel ativ
e , of a st ranger.  Thi s 
was the wor k of t he SS 
or the  common s oldi ers who kne w wher
e a nd what.  At 
ni ght t hey would  
raid t he ghet t o, t he y would co me in for a s port ki
nd of thi ng, and woul d j ust fi nd a fe w J e ws a nd  
hang the m on the street l anter ns .  Thi s I couldn
™t underst and.  This jolt ed
 me .  I could under sta nd 
they woul d t ake a wa y pe ople beca us e  they nee d peopl
e to work in the factorie
s, on the farms.  Why 
did they hang these teachers of mi
ne?  By then I wa s pretty much 
fully aware of the tragedy, of t he 
whole tragedy of it.  Then
 came a tremendous ax-see
-on (ph).  This was in 
Septe mber , 1942.  Ther e  
were little ones in between.  Ther
e was an announcement that all me
n have to report to the auto-
bites- on ( ph) , that the y have to ta ke a l ong some 
food a nd t he n they will be sent to the  Ukrai ne for  
wo rk .  B y t h en we  were  s oph istic at
ed enough not  t o tr ust t he m.   On
l y me n, not wome
n.  We  fi gure d  
still, if they want men only it mu st
 be for work, but on the other ha
nd, everybody to register.  There  
were thousands of Jews in the gh
etto.  By t he wa y, our 
ghetto beca me  a ugme nte d beca use t he J e ws  
fr om t he pr ovi dence™s  l i ke your
 fri e nds  Alice  Shick- ee ( ph) , Ko

sukkot ( ph) , all these plac es wer e bri n ging, the J e ws
 were brought into my ho
me town, in the ghetto, 
were all herded into the 
ghetto so the overcrowding 
was unbeli eva ble.  That  
all of them, all men had 
to re gister , we knew thi s muc
h, eve r y ma n in t he ghett o.  We ll,
 I remember that dilemma tha t  
eve ning be fore.  Who s hould go?  
 The man i n  my  fa mil y  wa s my

brot hers- i n-l aw, Fra nia™ s hus ba nd a nd Cyla™ s husban
d.  Mene k was too young to be, the y uni fi ed in  
that Me ne k wouldn™t go.  We d
eci ded our fat he r shouldn™t go beca
use we wer e a fr aid th at he  
wouldn™t be take n to wor k.  I  rec a
ll this ver y s ad day, he ca me in 
a nd I coul dn™t r eco

took off his bear d, he s u kkotve d hi s bear d to l ook

recogniti on beca use my fat her , you 
s ee his phot o, was a ve ry hands o
me man and the beard was par t  
of the  ha nds o meness .  And he look
e d about 100 years  ol der but he 
deci ded he want e d to go.  My 
husband we thought would be safe  because he was per mitted while 
in the ghetto, 
he was permitted 
to work out s i de of t he ghe
tto in his phar mac y.  They didn™t kn
ow it to operate it so he had a Red  
Cross on par t  of his wor k  clothe
s ba nd, on part of his white ba nd, 
he was per mi tted t o go duri ng t h e  
day s o the Ger mans coul d ha ve acc es s to the phar ma cy, but i n  the eve ni ng he ha d to c o me ba ck t o  
the ghetto.  Each evening, he wa
s checked, he was trying
 to smuggle a little 
fo od for us, but eac h  
evening he was checked.  One day 
he wa s be aten up terri bly beca use 
he t r ied to bring a fe w grai ns  
of rye, he had put th
em into his collar of his coat
 and they found it
 and t he y beat  hi
m up mercilessly.  
But  basica lly he was our  cont act wit h the out side  wo
rld t o some  ext e nt  be cau
se he wor ked ther e and 
we decided t o, he would 
be safe.  There was no que
stion, they™r e not going to
 take hi m because hi m 
they needed.  The man d
ecide d t o go, I don™t know what  made
 for  the dec i sion, pr oba bly t here  was  
still some sort of hope that they
 would go for work or
 something, and that, 
how could they hide?  
We ha d a hi ding pla ce i n that place
.  My husband reall y inst alled us
 ther e, be fore he we nt, he put  
my  mo the r , my  si ster  Cy la wh o t h
e n had typhoid fe ver , her  son, Me ne
k, my other  si ster  on the other  
side, me and Blancka Rosenberg.  
He  put us into t hat cella r downstair s and he covere d the openi ng 
of the fl oor with a little rug, put 
a table on top of it and ________
_ was sitting then that day.  I™ll 
never for get that da y, it wa s a hor rible day.  The 
me n were gone.  We hoped the y woul d retur n, we 
worried about our father mainl y 
bec ause  he was  older a nd we  wo
rri ed about hi m more t han t h e 
others.  We  thought they
 would return or go to 
work somewhere. 
 Sitting there waitin
g, there were a 
few ot her famili es t here, and Blan
ca™s chil d wasn™t  there anymore, 
I don™t belie ve so, no.  She wa s  
alone.  And suddenly we hear so
me footst eps on t op of that hi ding
 pla ce, wit h do
gs .  And boot s,  
German boots.  And the 
dogs stopped and star
ted smelling and we knew th
is was the end.  I still  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
39 
 
don™t know what ha ppe ned t hat  the y wal ke d a wa y. 
 Some thi n g distra cted t he m, perha p s they di dn™t  
trust the dogs enough.  I  do rec a

e ver ybody stoppe d breat hi

been a second but it fel t  like et er
nit y.  And how t he mo
ut hs of the se babi es wer e  covered wi t h 
pillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate.
  They didn™t, it was a mo
ment.  By then we knew 
that our days are counted, 
that they meant us 
too, not only the me
n.  We  were sitting
 there fo r hours, 
I say it felt like eternity, 
and suddenly we felt sm
oke.  The hous e wa s burni n g, they s et the house t o 
fir e .  We  de cide d we  ha ve t o go 
up.  We  walked out, 
our house wa s not on fi
re for some reason. 
The neighboring houses wer e made
 of wood, our house 
was not as made.  So
, ther e was smoke all 
over .  The Ger mans seemed to have 
been at the end of thei r day.  Th
ere we re dea d bodi es all over.  
We c oul d sti ll hear some  shooti ng.  The Ukr aini a
ns were wa lking into th
e apart me nts , taking out  
ever ythi ng t hey could.  Poli sh 
guns , Ukrai nia n guns .  We were al
i ve , our men were  not t her e.  I  
re me mb er t he mo me nt my siste r , 
Frania wit h her baby, wit h her 
c hild, she had typhoid fe ver .  
Some how or  other, late 
evening, the men come b
ack.  Who came ba

ca me ba ck a nd my hus ba nd ca me bac k.  The husbands
 of my s i sters di d not  come ba ck.  We didn™ t  
know what happe ned to th

The y were s endi ng the Ukraine™s to  
work.  The youn

will be laborers.  
We didn™t quite belie ve  it, a par t  of

 where they were going. 
 All the stories that 
survi vors s a y they kne w, we didn

 We  fo und out later 
thr o ugh an es ca pee  
that they went to Belzec, the exter mi nation camp at Be

whi ch event ually swall o wed so many
 of the Jews from ou

neighboring towns. 
And I™ve read a passage about it in the book by H
illberk and I fo und a long
 chapter about it man y

 wh at I  re me mb er bec a
use this was all later.
  We  had no idea. 
For many of us after the war, we 
didn™t know that they, 
where they were killed.
  We found out this

mu ch , mu ch  later.   Bu
t there they were taken, th
at  is wher e they were t ake
n, the y wer e t ake n to t he  
exter mi nati o n camp.  This was t h
e first time that we knew, we
 didn™t know exa ctl y, but s o me  
wit ness e s ca me  ba ck.  Some  pe opl e 
escaped fr om t he train and t hey we
re t ell ing us .  Thes e were ga s  
cha mbers , but he didn™t know beca use he esc ape d. 
 This came, this was later and I™m trying very 
careful to di sassociat e these t wo sour ces of info
r mati on , wh a t  we kn e w t hen an d wh at we k ne w  
later.  But this is what swallowe
d my t wo brot he rs-in-l aw.  Mene k™
s fat her a nd Al e x™s fat her , both 
young men, one was onl y 29, t he 
ot her I belie ve  wa s 32.  I alwa
ys t hought , how di d they shove  
these young me n int o gas  cha mbe rs, but the y did.  
We never sa w the m a gai n.  My sist er  Frani a wa s 
then, was ve ry high, typhoid fever,
 a n d s he  ke pt t h e baby next  t o 
her body a nd he  was  not i n fect ed, 
nobody understands how this 
happened.  We were all 
starved, we were hungry
.  Aft er that ax-s ee- on 
(ph) t he Ger ma ns ar ranged for us to have a soup kitc
hen.  It™s reviewed in
 the Reich.  There were  
still thousands of Jews le
ft , they were still being brought in
 from the provincia
l towns.  There 
see me d al wa ys to be mor e  Je ws.  Lat e r I found 
out that on t h at day 8,000 Jews were r e moved but  
there were mo re.  I think they wanted to appease us
, t he y wa nted to a ppe ase 
us  by making sure  we  
will not hide, th
at there is still some life  going on.  And 
actually after every ax
-see-on (ph) which,  
after this extreme tensio
n, this extreme pain, th
is extre me depressi on, a de pres sion hung over the 
ghett o for hours.  Aft er t h at you 
s o me how r ec over ed.  You got  up in
 the morning and 
looked out, it  
was quiet, you went backto whatever you were tryi ng to do, a little 
cooking, whatever
.  By then it 
wa s pot ato peels.  You went
 ba ck t o pray.  You we nt bac k to wh
atever wor k.  I wor ked in a fact ory 
where Bl ancka worked, i n a tr e-po
-tosh ( ph)  fact ory, t he y wer e maki ng unifor ms for t h e Ger ma n  
soldiers.  Going out of the ghetto 
was permitted with 
a special permission.  E
ach evening we have to  
come back.  Jews we
r e st ill per mitt ed to go out t o t hese wor k
 pl aces, they al ways 
had to come back.  
After e ach r aid, a ft er eac h ax-s ee- on (ph) there were 
da ys tha t  you c oul dn™ t talk to eac h  other .  You 
chec ke d out who wa s s
till alive but then there wa
s some nor mal cy.  Nor ma l c y of li fe.  Ama zing, but  
it was t here .   Peopl e tri ed to go ba ck.  I thi nk 
the soup kit che n, whic h they intr oduce d so late  
through t he yood-e n-r od (ph)
 was a way of appeasing 
us , of making sure  we 
wo uld not be afraid t o  
leave  our home s, whic h would ma ke
 their  wor k easier , but  t hese ar
e hindsight.  We didn™t know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
41 
 
what happened t hen.  All  we kn
e w , t he yood-e n-r od ( ph) as ke d my 
father, it was so important to 
ma ke s ure t h at ever ybody would get 
the right kind of portions, that so
up, so they aske
d my father to 
supervi se that soup kitchen, t o sta nd t o dis h out that
.  He was t oo wea k b y t h
en, he j ust didn™t want  
the job.  His legs wer e s w ollen.  He as ked t he m 
whether t hey woul d per mit his youngest  daughte r  t o  
do it  and t he y di d a nd so it was my 
j ob.  Thi s I™ll  never forget  agai n.
  Originally to, they gave us  
so me  h o rse  me at.   The y  ma de ha mb u r
gers  of hors e meat , t he y put in 
some  hors e me at i n the ghett o.  
The women there wer e making thi s in
to ha mbur gers .  It took me a long
 time to get use to eating it. 
But s oup, a nd I re me mber the l ong, long li nes of
 Je ws .  Someti mes I woul d recogni ze relati ves ,  
someti mes r ecognize the teacher s, someti mes I recogn
ize t he father of anot he
r student.  They di dn™t  
look like human beings, th
e way they shuffl ed the i r fee t , the way the y aske d and t he ple ading tone,  
ged-dak (ph), ged-
dak (ph) means sic
k.  The soup was, ha
d a little vegetables 
but it was watered, 
there was a little bit, a fe
w beans, a few othe
r vegetables and everybody wa
nted to ged-dak (ph).  It 
wa s my job to be fair about it and t o  make sure
 ever ybody would 
get their right a mount of food. 
Thi s last ed p e rha ps t wo wee ks .  One day , it was c l
ose t o thi s sl aughter hous
e in whic h was a Je wi sh  
slaughte r  house in whi ch chicke n we re always kil l
ed.  There was a scream and I fi gured what are  
the Ge r mans bri ng, chi cke n, the y a r e kill ing t h e 
chicken?  A fe w hours 
later they found they  
slaughtered in this slaughter ho
use, they slaughtered our childre
n.  This was the end of the  
supplication, this wa
s the end of me , thi s was 
j u st the end of me .  I r a
n home .  Coul
dn™t t alk.  I  
coul dn™t t ell anybody what I heard. 
 The rumor came lat er and ever yb
ody heard it.  This was the en d 
of my s oup kitchen st anding, I t h
ink it was the end of the total soup
 kit che n.  The s oup kitchen, the  
people sta y wit h me , t he  pe ople  who looke d li ke su
kkot dows of their earlier selves.  These people 
who we re be ggi ng, ged- dak ( ph) .  I

  This wa s the ghet t o.  I woul d

Q: Mari a, when you ca me bac k fr om that horre nd
ous e xperie n ce, I mea n, both the soup kitchen a nd 
then listening to the children, 
the people being slaughtered.  Yo
u said you ca me ba ck and you 
didn™t, to the hous e, and you didn™t
 t ell a nyone .  How were  you able  
to keep i t inside  and, or not  
show a nyt hi ng, or?  

A: I rememb er, I thre
w mysel f on the bed.  We ha d a very s m
a ll place , one room.  I thr e w mys el f on 
the bed and I sobbe d a nd sobbe d fo
r  hours.  And then I went , and 
t he n my hus ba nd ca me i n a nd I 
think we began to ta
lk, and then the news was 
all over.  The city knew
 by t he n, the  ghetto, but  
i mme diat ely I just coul dn™t put into words , I coul dn™t 
talk, I didn™t, I didn™t realize the extent of it.  I 

remember it  was chronological  
I™m not  sure t h at I reme mber 
exactly when it happened, but 
sometime in 1942, all of these things were to
wards the end of 1942.  A woma n c a me to our  
apartment, to this 
s ma ll apart me nt that my husba nd a nd I 
stayed, and I recall 
she fell on her knees  
plea ding wit h hi m to give her 
some t hing.  I ca nnot r e
me mber whet her he did or didn™t, I  di dn™t  
underst and what thi s 
wa s all a bout.  I found out 
l ater that she pleaded wi th
 hi m to give her c yanide  
for the chi ld.  She™s ali ve, this wo
man is alive and I think the child is
 al ive, somewhere in Australi a.  
Thi s I hear d many years later. 
 I™m t rying to rememb
er , she was fro m a ___
______ i n Kol o myj a,  
Mrs. Her ma nn, I r e me mber.  Appar e ntly the  ne ws 
came that t he children wo
uld be ta ken a wa y.  I  
think the ful l  trage dy fel l  upon me 
at that point .  When I heard ch
il dre n, that they™re planning to  
re move the childre n, then I kne w that this was the e
nd a nd t here really i s no wa y of e sca ping, ther e™s  
no more tal k about goi ng to t he Uk
raine for work or an
ythi ng.  That night, it wa s a fter t h at  
butc heri ng, that night sor t  of br ought the full a war
eness, the full confr ontati on with the t ruth as to  
what was ha ppe ning.  By 
then, I thi nk Blancka who worked i n
 that fac t or y at
 _____________ was  
Lydia, t he Polish woman who wa s th
e ma nager of the factor y, it was 
about  that ti me that she came  
home s ayi ng that Lydi a  is ready t o  give her pa
pers to r un awa y.  I stil l didn™t understa nd the 
busi nes s of r unning a way, I couldn
™t underst and a ny of it.
  A day l ater s he  brought pa pers and s he  
showed me , she had a ke n-car d-da (ph), s he ha d s o
mething which showed th
at she was, the name

wa s Brue n- flower Per- nash-i k ( ph) and we e nc our
aged her to go away 
although I wa sn™t sur e  
because at one point earl ier one of
 my colleagues was trying to ge
t through the ghetto wall and she 
wa s shot on the spot .  So there was a great de al 
of conflict t hat we wer e  encouragi n g about, we 
already knew by then that things
 wer e  goi ng very, ver y ba d.  She ha
d l ost all her fa mil y by then, so  
we t hought, perhaps she should go. 
 She asked me that I s houl d join, I was n™t rea dy t o do a nyt hing.  
My hus ba nd starte d tal ki ng a bout it .  He was ne
a r ly e veryda y  on t he othe r side  and s o mehow or  
other he began workin
g t oward my escape without  
my knowledge of it becaus
e I di dn™t wa nt t o hear  
about it.  This was towards the end 
of 1942.  By then, we bega n to ta
lk about it, that you need some 
hidi ng pl ace s outsi de of the ghe
tto.  The number  of t he pe ople
 wa s narr owing down very much , 
there we re j ust a fe w thous and pe op
le le ft.  At i t ™s hei ght , I thin
k there were 30,0
00 Jews in the  
ghett o.  So we kne w t ha t  things 
are narrowi ng very much, but ther e 
was some peac e.  The y di dn™t  
do anythi ng for a  whil e. 
 Some how or ot her we s t arted tal kin
g a bout per h aps  we c oul d get some  
hidi ng pl ace s on the outs ide.  We ha d a friend a
nd a woman who was a custom
er in our store, not  
quite a cust omer, she wa s a Polis h woma n, a  ve
ry fi ne l a dy who was 
poor.  So, whe n s he  
established a relation, my father 
who would give her so
me of the dishes whatever for, a little 
mone y, duri ng the ghett o  days s he oc casionall y s muggled s o me food for us.  Her na me was We in- a-

rof-s ka (ph), and her pla ce wa s acros s fr om t he hous
e in which originally my
 sister Cyla and he r  
hus ba nd live d.  So mehow or ot her , he was in touch w
ith her .  I found out thes
e things much later.  
But he was also in touch with an
other couple.  We ll, I™
m jumping a little bit ahea
d of time here, but  
actuall y came December  of 1942 wh
e n we be gan t o tal k 
seriously about it.  Th
at  I shoul d be the ic e 
brea ker i n a  wa y, I s hould be the fir st one i n t he  fa
mily to get out,
 to join Blancka, and then my 
sister  and he r chil d wi ll c o me. 

Q: How would you desc ribe peoples  
relations hips  wit h ea ch other a s thi ngs are getti ng so te rribl e?  
And you de s c ribe  thi s s o up k
itchen almost like th
e y™re ghost s wal king t o wards  you?  
A: Fa milies are di ffer ent .   I™ve seen a  lot of, it™s 
painful t o talk about it be
c ause I saw i n fami lies, 
how people  wer e gr abbi ng t he por tio
n of food.  These  were fa mili es
 li ke my own whe re we al ways 
kept  pa ssi ng the food, I™ m not  hungr y.  Pa rticul ar ly 
my par ent s, we were t his kind of fa mi l y, cl ose

fa mily, always passin
g the fo od to the next one,
 we™re not hungry.  But in some families, they were  
fi ghti ng for t he bit e  of food. 
 The pe ople looked li ked gh
ost , they were , all of us wer e in this, i n thi s  
area there was no food l eft
.  I reme mber when
 we s t arte d c ooking the potato chi ps , potat o peels .  
My mother cooked it in water, sh
e added a little salt to it.  This 
was the lunch.  Lydia  Wen-a-rof-
ska (ph), this is the Po
li sh w o man  wh o so me ti me s s mu g gl e d i n
, in some  way she smuggled in a 
little fl our, so the flour had to be
 stretched.  It was mi
xed with, someti
mes you had only potatoes. 
But t he star vation was e verywhere , de fini tely.  I 
recall, somewhere or ot her I was younger and I  
think thi s hel ped bec aus e my pa rent s l egs we re ver y
 s woll en, particul arly my fat her, he c oul dn™t get  
into hi s shoes, he wore  slipper s my then.  I to
ok a look at the m at one  point a nd I  kne w the y 
coul d™nt ™t str etch it beca use of the 
starvation.  But more th
an that, I was just  wo
rried that they will  
be s hot .  Someti mes I  sa w t hes e wea k people i n t he ho
use , they didn™t e ve n bother t o t ake t he m out ,  
they shot them right there.
  So it was at that time, but you want me
 to come back to 
Lydi a, right?   To 
Lydia, I  guess? 
Q: I want to ask you, was your
 father still praying, was he still religious in 
a certain way? 
A: Yes, he was still pray
ing.  Many of the or
thodox Jews were still praying. 
 I hope he prayed when 
he was going to dea t h, I hope s o, be caus e pra yin
g you know, somehow or other gets i nto a not he r  
orbit.  I read about it late
r, that ma ny of th
e Has- sid-i ms (ph) the y went i nto t he fire while  prayi ng so  
they didn™t feel what  was  goi ng on
.  I suppose t hat some of t hese 
be havi ors anest heti zed the m, I a m  
not sur e it ha ppe ne d to my fat her 
but, I wish it would. 
 They were, I™ll tell y
ou in a minute how they 
were killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working in that part
, in the ta-kosh 
(ph) factory w e  
came home ever y day but 
then ther e were days th
at we were not permitte
d t o leave the ghett o  
anymore.  And when Blancka left
, s h e some how or other, s he  put 
something into 
the mi nd o f my  
hus ba nd in particul ar, tha t  ther e i s a  way out .  But 
wh ether he™d thought about 
it earlier I™m not sure , 
he didn™t s u kkotre it wit h me .  By the wa y, he lo
oke d extr e m ely non-J e wi sh while I looke d Je wis h. 
I didn™t know I l ooke d J ewi sh until  I  got t o t he ot
her si de , but he di d a nd hi
s Polish was perfect too, 
so he ha d some i dea s at t hat point , I t hink.  He 
st arted tal ki ng about me a nd I di dn™ t wa nt to hear  

about it .  Fi nally, the arr a nge me nt  wa s that I woul d be
 the first one to go to 
meet Bl ancka, then my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
45 
 
sister a nd he r baby woul d 
come , and then he woul d arrange for  my  ol dest si ster and her son a nd my  
parents, he will arrange a hiding 
place outside of town, 
through the help
 of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska 
(ph), and then he will come
.  And he got himself pape
rs too.  I can™t remember
 the name, but he said 
he ha d paper s.  He ha d, he brought i n papers one day, s o meti me in Dec e mber, he br ought in papers  
with the name of Julianna
 Gol-ska  (ph), he s h owed
 me , t hat™s me .  He t o
ld me he obtained it 
through t he help of s o me  
non-J e wish fa mi ly and t his
 was authentic.  Actually
 a  girl  who looked like  
me, who had died, a
nd he purchased the papers, who he got 
them through I still 
don™t know.  There 
was so little talk about it.  Perhap
s he talked more and 
the fright on my part 
really obstructed my 
thinking about it, or my memory 
about it.  I r ecall , the onl y way, I 
st ill don™ t know how I deci ded t o  
go.  The onl y wa y, beca use he wor k ed so skill fully 
on me , that he™ll joi n me in t wo weeks, he™l l 
come and meanwhile 
he had arra nged all t hes e t hi ngs , and it  s e
emed, he told me th
e idea thing, that  
I will be the path breaker, that 
I™ll be the one to lead the way and 
they will all surv
ive this way. 
Wh ether I really believed it, I wa
nted to believe it, I still don™t know.  It was a very hard decision 
but there wa s no ti me for decisi on
.  Some how or  other they t old 
me tomorrow, these people will 
pick you up in the mor ni ng at  6: 00 
in the morning.  It wa s Christ ma
s , 1942, the  pe opl e I pers onally  
didn™t know but my fa mi ly di d.  
The y were la ndowner s, Poli sh la n

who had bus iness wit h my father.  
M y father us e to gi ve
 them these fi ne porc

re me mb ered  hi m an d t he y wa nte d 
to do something for the family.  
How we  got hold of them, I still 
don™t know.  Pe rha ps  my father t alk

ese things I wish I kn

the str ange se nse t hat I™ll ne ver

how I tried totally to 
deny that feeling, to stop
 that fe eling, to stop th
inking about it  and to c onc

was sure that somebody will identi

I was with these Polish pe

it was a lot of festivity goi ng on, there wa s

 go to the stat ion a nd buy me  a  
ticket , I wa s  afrai d to run around t he  station, and 
all I want i s to go ba ck to Kol o myj a.  The ma n 
save d my li fe in stra nge  wa ys by
 talking to six hours, he literally
 out-talked me. 
 By the n, I  was  
totally, totally passive and totally listl
ess.  I ple ade d, all I want is to 
die with my people
 in the ghetto 
and no argume nt reall y ma de se nse t o me , I wa nt ed 
to get to Kolomyja and I 
want ed t o die wit h my 
people , and he ke pt sa yi ng that I™ll never get to 
my people, you will not be able t o get int o the  
ghetto, they will shoot
 me at the station,
 and nothing penetrat
ed.  Perhaps it did 
and I didn™t want to  
hear i t .  I remember  that
 after six hours, I couldn™t hear anymor
e.  And he  didn™t 
go to the railwa y 
station a nd I pa sse d a n other  day a nd he ma de  up
 a whole story, he wa
s my fia ncee , he wa s 
somebody that was interested
 in me, and he w
ill visit again.  And then la
ter was very interested in 
him, he looked like Polish nobilit
y, I was fi guring there 
was some money too, 
I stayed another day 
and another day.  And I  ha d a st
or y, the st ory was that I came 
to study ___________, I take a 
__________ cour se.  So, the cl asse
s are not held ever y day and it™s 
pretty flexible. 
 Anyway, with 
the Czech she looked away, she di
dn™ t know, I stil l don™t know.  
We don™t know t hes e t hings, but  
she kept me .  A fe w days later Bl

 fell thr ough for her in
 Wars aw, s he ha d only

us and was, she al ways  was a char is matic st ud

Chr i st ma s naturall y, I had ne ws fr om t he ghetto
, fro m Mar i a Roma n-o- r o f-

woman who pushed food into the 
ghetto, and that everything wa

were still alive.  And one day, 
Blanca™s looking for work
, everybody said I shouldn™t walk in the 
streets so easily, but then people 
were conscious I l ooked Jewish, 
I di dn™t know, but Bl ancka looked 
Poli sh, so she we nt for a  ne wspa

 Stali ngra d was ta ken over b y

the mor ni ng or s o, t he y ca me , a nd  
they took all out of them
, they took them ou

young girl, _____ __________, Tou-

t h e me n, my fa ther and hi

And hungry they were, they were ill, they
 were not dressed we

cold, sleet in the night, in the 
middle of the night, they dragge

Kolomy ja, they dragged

she thinks, she thought

 wa s late afternoon,

listening to the story, all I recall was that all I h
oped for was that the floo
r would ope n up and I wil l  
disa ppe ar.  I didn™t wa nt t o live.  She didn™t kn
ow e nough a bout my hus ba nd, he was s epa rated fro m  
my fat her  and M ene k.  She t hought 
she hear d somet hing, th
a t he  was  take n to pr ison, t hat t he y wer e 
beating him, she wasn™t 
sure, nobody knew.  I still don™t know. 
 Apparently, they 
either killed him 
in pris on or took hi m to Ch
ap- a-rof- s a (ph) .  That wa s the ni ght,
 the la st night a fter that, no Je w wa s  
left in Kol o myja.  M y nephew, Me nek, wr ote up about 
that night .  I recall  that I couldn™t sta nd just 
being ali ve .  I stretc he d on that  floor, Fra nia t oo,
 a nd I wa nte d not hing but 
for the floor to open and 
the fl oor didn™t open, t ha t  hard floo
r wa s the r e.  I  coul dn™t  eve n cry.  I c oul dn™t t ake it  i n in a ny way. 
Except  Blancka woke me from that
 s tupor I  thi nk some ti
me  la ter sa yi ng that the la ndl a dy want s t o  
bring us some tea.  And this mean
t  we ha d t o get up, was h up, and 
look pretty.  A
nd I recall looking 
at the mirr or  and putti ng on lipst ic
k and not believing it™s me.  She br
ought in tea.  
We  had t o  ma ke  
arrangement s for my sist er™s pl

later we tried t o fi nd 
a pl ace for t hem.   They fo
und ot her people from my 
home town, ot her women,  
the men were all killed by
 then.  And the story of
 ma ny ca me out mu
ch later.  Wh at happened to 
hi m is a r eal ly fant astic story. 
 He was together with my father
, bei ng ma r c he d from t hat horri bl e  
night, and there was shooting a
nd the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people. 
And he wa s bla ming my fat her  in
 a wa y, sa ying, I tol d you we sh

should have gone to the place, what
ever, and my father sa
id to hi m, somet hi ng fr om t he Tal mud, he  
said, the Talmud says if 
the s wor d is around your

16 years old, he int erpre t ed thi s as a s i gn fr om hi s 
grandfat her he s hould r u n a way, s o he ran a wa y. 
For  ye ars he  wa s tr ying t o ge t hold of t hat quotat

awa y a nd t h e people we r e  bei ng mar c hed, they we re
 marc hed t o Sukkot p-a- rot-s ka (ph) .  By t he n it  
wa s earl y morni ng and t he neighbor

in hi s le g, a shot  ca me  to, a bul let 
got  into hi s le g.  He 
fell on snow and ice. 
 A Ukrainian police man  
stepped over  hi m a nd sa id to the Ge r ma ns very st
oica lly, he ™s dea d.  And as that c olonna de of  
people marc hed a nd mar che d for hours, he was lying

so he cr ouched, he approache d

he sa w a ba by i n the fir epl

 told me about 
five ye ars a go, he  coul dn™t  tal k 
about it .  And he di dn™t  know whet
her  the pare nts  who r an, le ft  the

apparent ly t here was no fir e be
for e, or whethe r the Ukraini a ns 
or Ger ma ns put t he baby int o the  
fir eplace and set t he fireplace afire. 
 This he kept secret
.  Some how or other , 
he ju mped fr om t hat 
place beca use he hear d the SS mar chi ng, 
a nd t he Ukraini ans, he jumped i n
 the attic to a not her place. 
He was jumping most of the time,
 he  hear d t he shots a nd thr o ugh 
_____________ in t hat s now he  
got outside of the ghetto to th
e hous e of the Poli sh woma n, Bron
-ra -off- ska (ph) , who use t o live  
across the st reet from t hei

student s who lived ther e because they went to t h

 her somet hing, t ha t ™s 
how she live d.  Ver y ear ly morni ng,
 he appear ed at the door of th

the  Chap- a-rot- s ka ( ph) , he  kne w t his  was

he plea de d wit h the woman t o let hi m i n for t h e

e sai d she can™t, she™ s afrai d b

there .  Some how or other , I thi nk, 
out of pity for this child-animal, 
s he let hi m i n for one night.  She 
put hi m in t h e bar n.  Ne xt  morni ng she  ca me to ta

occasionally with some of the di

a little money, I don™t kn

she didn™t ha ve t he heart t o ta ke hi m out.  She l e
ft hi m, she  covered hi m wi
t h stra w and under st ra w 
he li ve d t her e for  a bout s i x or s e

 She lived with great danger, her 
hus ba nd she  appare ntly l et on ma ny
 mont hs l ater .  The Ukr ai nian 
st ude nt s ne ver  kne w about it. 
Every night she would smuggle a little fo od downstair

mmobilized, he di

wa s _________ t he n.  One da

.  We ll, that night, he says, all

his  mother and his gr andfat her a nd his grandmot her  
beca use that™ s all he coul d he ar, all ni ght a nd all da

 This was the last of 
the Kolo myja Jews and he remember
s that all he was, felt guilty that
 he wasn™t there.  But he was  
covered i n s now, by s t ra w.  And one  day, towar d
 the Spring i n March, 
he saw the snow coming

down the windows so it wa
s a little light.  Until then, 
he didn™t see any day
light because snow and 
ice covere d the wi ndows .   And he looked ar ound a
nd he saw some books.  
These Ukr aini an students 
apparent ly when gra duati ng t he y thr e w t he books in
to t he ba se me nt.  One of t he books he took wa s  
a che mistr y book.  He  st ar

the foremost bio-che mist.  He™s the 
one  who is  t he developer  of t h

beginning of it, the chemistr

she could afford 
to give him, she was afraid, ev
ery night would bring dow

he li ved in e xtre me  terr or of disc over y, al ways a f

 And one day, the woman 
comes  in, she sa ys , t here  is a  de

that they di e d on t he roa d, but I™ll ne ver know. 
 They were separat ed,

i magine what happened to
 my father all alone.  Menek ra

survi ve  to t el l  this  st ory but he di d.  So, t his  wa
s the end of the ghetto.  I 
knew these details fr om my  
sister i n t hat house, that eveni ng, 
a nd I said, we ha ve t o ge t up beca
use  thi s lady de cide d to gi ve us

because they wer e denounced b y  
then.  My si ster ha d some dia monds se wn int o

Blancka and me ali ve too.  At one point , I needed
 ne w docume nts a nd the dia monds bought it.  We  
need an apar t ment and the diamond

I notic e a girl  
who l ooks a t  me very mu ch, it was  
a for mer student fro m my home, 
a  Ukr ainia n gi rl.  And be fore I 
know, I  noti ce that she is bri

 It wa s ve ry da ngerous a nd I  
motioned t o Bra nc h and to the ot
her wome n, it™s not good, we have
 to do something, we have to 
disa ppe ar, but how do we di

 deci ded to dis appear in the next  
store, which was a millenary
 store, selling hats.  Th
is is 6 o™clock in the ev

hat in the store hoping that this 
man will disappear.  We
ll, sitting there and tr

what we ne ed at that point , he did not di sappe a

 had t o move.  He di d  
appr oac h us , in ver y qui e t  wor ds, voic e, not  to 
make any noi se , he said, co
me with me , I know your  
Je wiss es.  He starte d ma rching us out, what hel p

all of us at t hat point .  And he t ook us some wher e in an is ola t ed area , he had a re vol ver wit h hi m

shouldn™t shoot my sister , i f he 
ha s to shoot  some one , me
, bec ause  s he had a baby
, she had a child. 
Anywa y, he deci ded not t o shoot bu

there  were  fi ve women of us .  He got  eve r yt hing.  
He e ve n took my c oat.  We  c oul dn™t  go back to

Finally we got a place, thin

  It was a better time.

I see many Polish a nd Ukraini ans, no, Polis h and

 I don™t know t he cit y, I don™t

was at the end of th

 totally immobilized.  I wa
it for this ma

 He takes me back t o t he police

what little money I had, 
and he says to me , 
come with me.  He 
puts me in the car, 
he goes with me, 
he says, you have no place to stay I will get you 
a place to st ay overni ght .  I figure he probabl y i s  
putti ng me at a place where I™ll be de

a  that I look J ewi sh, no, he didn™ t say  
Jewish, he says, it™s better if 
you try to get out, let her stay home and it will stop something, the  
message was that I looked 
Jewish.  We  late

 I st ayed there.  The

  The  truc ks we re being 
loaded with people and 
there wa s shooti ng goi ng right ther

 He came back 
a few ti mes, he tol d Blancka to

fr om that, I™m use to vi

And t hey look a t  me

ope ne d my big mouth a nd I  
sa id, I™ m going to 
call t he poli ce, you know, I 
t hreatened hi m.  Thi s  
happened t o me a few ti mes, wh
enever I was accused of somet hin
g, I woul d open a 
bi g mout h, but I  
wa s in danger all of the time.  We
 lived with these peop
le i n a  very good neig
hbor hood beca use t he  
Ger ma ns  oc cupi ed t he best 
part of town.  We ha d a r oom to our
s elves a n d they woul d tra vel ver y  
often to Germany, th
ey had a baby.  And for us these  were 
t he best da ys , whe n t he y we nt a wa y 
beca use  we coul d i nvit e some pe opl e , we found pe
opl e li ke Lod-j oy (ph) and High-lin-ka ( ph)  and 
Boi l -it (ph), we found t h e under g
round.  I r ecall disti nctly t he  da
y when I  found out t here wa s an  
undergr ound.  This was one of t h
e great days in my li
fe .  My depr essi on, my sens e of e xtre m e  
terror, lifted.  I knew if I™m going to die, I™m go
i ng to di e in some way knowing that Ger ma ns ar e  
being killed.  There is a resist
ance movement.  It was 
a fa ntastic experience.
  Until then, I didn™t  
know a bout  any resi sta nce .  The y wer e the fir st 
ones to introduce me to 
it.  There™s the Polish 
resista nce a n d Je wish resistanc e fight ers and the y
™re actually attacking Germ
ans.  To be connected 
with this was, lift ed me up in 
wa ys that I di dn™t  know until  that was possi ble .  I wa sn™t a fr ai d  
beca use I was not a frai d  of dyi ng.  So many ti me s 
that I want ed to die, I t hink that dyi ng, it i s the  
wa y to die , I wa s a fr aid 
of the way in which they™
ll kil l  me .  If 
I™ m detected as a Jew, ther e ar e 
particular kinds of brutalities ag
ainst people who cheated the Ge
rman government,
 these are the 
German SS.  So they 
had horrible ways of 
killing you and this is
 what I wanted to 
avoid.  But to be 
dea d, it r eall y di d not ma tter.  At no t i me did I beli ev
e I woul d survi ve , at no ti me did I belie ve t his  
wa s pos sibl e .  We  di dn™t  s
ee t he end of the war  yet. 
Q: Let me  ask you a somewh

you wal ke d i nto the  Ke ns el (ph)

A: I rehearsed to some extent, I 
c an™t re me mber that I re hear se d.  
I was  pre pare d in a way, that  I™l l  
wear a, what  do you call it, a di sh 
towel around my body.  That I™ll sp
e ak t hat Poli sh sl ang.  I kne w  
about enough Polish, althou
gh I didn™t think th
ey will know the 
difference, really, 
but that I will be  
looking down at them wi
th some sort of suspicion.
  That I will take the job 
that fits me or I will not  
be inter este d , the job may be too heavy, I™ll se e.  Th
at I come fr om Mok-ul-t of (ph) , Mok-ul-tof ( ph)  
was a place, was a suburb which

ope n bar s and so on.  And 
that my mother i s a washer wo man th
ere .  And t his ga ve t he m, Bl anc ka  
translated it all, and then
 they sent me out and th
en t hey call e d in Blancka 
sayi ng that they™ r e not  
sure that they, that 
I belong, really.  This
 is background, I look a little like
 a thief, that I may steal. 
And t here was a guest of t heir s t h
ere, no, she looks mo re like a pr
ostitute.  So Blancka sa ys she 
didn™t know, but she™ll hire me 
fo r a  fe w da ys,  s
ee what happens.  And t h
en t her e were t wenty 
people working for thi s 
co mp an y, s o me o f t he m wer e  Je wi sh  we
 found out later. 
 Th ey were t he  
CPA™s a nd t he ac counta nts.  And wo
rk, being se nt on err ands wa s a de

kne w I™ll ne ver co me ba ck, but t hey 
sent me t o buy thi s and buy that
.  And thes e ki ds in the st reet , 
sayi ng J ud- i f ka (ph), l o oki ng at me  sayi ng J ud-

i mme diat ely, it is i n t he blood strea m .  Whe n peop
le ar e trai ned for gener a

tify enemy 
people t hey know.  Sa me, I a m s ure it wa s her e, wi
t h white s and blac ks for centurie s.  So e ver y ki d 
in the street identified 
me  that ea si ly.  And wh
enever I  came hom
e safe, it  was a 
mira cle .  O u r  
greate st e ne mie s wer e the pe opl e wh

i s like  a door man, but act ually  
like a concierge, but l esser in st

 r e gi ste r  and he wa s on t he out  
look for Jews because fi nding thes
e Je ws , ther e wa s mone y. 
 So there were always
 some storie s, t ha t  
the Jew was caught and there were al
ways posters in the st
reets, they will offe r 
$50, $100, whatever 
it is, if they would fi nd
 the Jew.  So there 
was  a s earchi ng for Je ws goi ng on c onti nually. 
Q: T here  wa s a  wor d t hat  wa
s us ed fo r these posters?  
A: Sch- mol- siv-a- nik ( ph).  Sch-
mo l (ph) mea ns fat.  The y ass u
med that peopl e woul d live off the  
fat.  And they™re job, and ther e 
were too ma ny of them
, terri bly many, might ha ve ha ppe ned in ot her  
countries too but in Warsaw it was 
a gang of Sch- mol-si v-a- ni k™s (
ph) .  Some  of t he m mi ght ha ve  
bee n rich, some poor, s o me j ust 
hated Jews, some just 
wanted the money, whatever it  was, they™re  
job was t o find a Je w a nd to e xto
rt mone y from hi m.  Some ti me s 
they delivered you later to the  
polic e station but some ti me s they 
let  you go.  Someti mes the y took your doc ume nts i n additi on t o  
the mone y.  But  Sch- mol - siv-a- ni k (p

  They st ood i n t he str eets of 
Wa rsa w and they obser v ed you and they a ppr oac h

very suspi ci ousl y at  me .  And I

afr aid of t hose Poli sh doctors to

then t he  sa me ha ppe ned over a n d  
over a gai n.  Stel- ma Hov-en-je v-e ns ( ph) , the book
 about t he story about St

brot her by t he way just published a 
fa nta s tic me moir on t he Hol oc a ust ,
 not to be missed.  I™ll give 
you l ater t h e full title of it , I spoke  to hi m on t he 
tele phone .  Stel - ma Hovi

a chief bookkeeper for the

sister , he t ol d her t hat I mi ght be

 that house people were taken to 
Ger ma n y, he  was n™t s ure .  He lat e

 ha s that fa ntasti c  story about  
he and hi s brothe r ran a wa y from 
Treblinka.  He later jo
ined his br othe r in It

whom he was involved rejected 
hi m, that was how t he stor y goe s, he ca me to Ital y.  He was  
depressed, he committed su

, you ought to rea d
 the book, it™ s a  
fa ntastic me moir.  But this was on

ople working in this
 pla ce wer e  Je wi sh , 
Blancka recogn ized so me
one fr om her home town.  The y we

ma squera de d as a ma in of the wors

But she tol d  Stel- ma Hovich ( ph) 
and a certain, years lat er, but anyw

day, a ma n that I had se

somet hing?   To st op?  

Q: No,  we  h a ve  a fe w more mi nu tes .  

A: That™s all  we have? 

Q: Fi ve more minutes.

Q: Let  me g o b ack  to  so met hin g

A: Sure.  There was somebody in
 our  house  who wa s al
wa ys  under, al wa ys liv
e under disguis e.  I 
forgot her name now, but  she i ntr
oduc ed us to Hel e-inka (ph) a nd 
Bowl -ick (ph) an
d the y loved our  
place because it was a safe pl ace in a Ger man ne
i ghbor hood, Ger ma n pe
opl e living i n it, so  
occasionall y  they would come u
p.  Partic ularl y when the  pe ople  
for whom we worked were in 
Ger ma n y and the pla
ce was closed.  On a Sunday
, the y would come up a n d 
the y woul d teac h us to  
sing partis an songs, fro m  the Bont
 (ph), I couldn™ t  believe it, the whol e thi ng!  I say this was t he  
happiest days in my  life  during th
e Holocaust because I felt, I didn™t
 feel t he fear, I  di dn™t  feel  th e 
fe ar at all, I just fe lt the sense 
of resi st ance .  And I  think i f I™
m not mi sta ken, Bl
ancka  once br ought  
some doc uments for c hil dren bec aus e  it wa s such a 
safe place, so we had 
____________ all of the  
time . 
Q: So this is Latka-mead (ph)? 

A: Latka- me ad (ph), I thi nk s he br ought some doc um
ent s for c hildre n int o our ol d room but I™ m not  
sure , at t his poi nt Bowl-i ck (ph) 
a nd Hel e-inka ( p h) were ver y  much
 a part of our lives and Henrich 
(ph) , he di ed later.  Ther e  wa s 
a not her  man who wrote t he bea u tiful
 me mo ir of ___________, Bear  
Wit nes s, Be rnard ( ph) .  He t oo wa s invol ve d i n
 some  way.  So it was 
like I knew life , an 
unbelie vabl e  kind of ne w life where 
we fe lt even if we 
died t here was a r esistance.  The Ger mans  
are losing.  So Sunday afternoo
n, oc casionall y, t hese  pe opl e wer e 
a wa y, t hey woul d c o me a nd we 
would listen to the in British radi
o, which was certainly not permitte
d.  And we would sing these 
songs and one da y, agai nst our expe ctations , the se 
people , the Ger ma ns , come
 ba ck earlier from a 
weekend.  They use to go to Be r
lin, come back earlier for a weeke
nd a n d here is thi s  group, we a r e 
singing and they™re listening to th
e British radio.  Well, that fri
ght was unbelievable, but the y  
wal ke d in.  We hid t hes e people under our beds , we
 fi nally got them out, it 
wasn™t so simple.  We  
had ma ny such oc casi ons  where we s muggled pe ople 
i n and t hen we ha d to offe r the m under th e  
bed t o a hidi ng place , a n d the n to s m uggle out t hr
ough t he door, al l of t he s
e thi ngs were extr emely 
anxiety provoking. 
 Scenarios, but they were 
a part of our life at that
 point.  Until the man came 
sayi ng he was ta king Bl anc ka t o Ge r ma ny i f s h e 
want s to go a nd she regi
st ered for a tri p, t he 
separ ation was ver y di ffi cult for us .  I re me mbe r , we

party, a get awa y pa rty, and when I wal ke d out of
 the party I was drunk a
nd I kept s aying in the  
tram, I™ m Jewish, that™s all I needed
 to sa y.  And they foll owi ng da y 
she l eft  and I  was left al one, it  
was a t erribl e loss for me nat urall y,
 but she , we  t hought a bout the pa
st, how t o j oin her , e veryt hi ng 
wa s very uncertain. 
Q: Maria, you talked about how di
fficult it was when Bl
ancka wa s leaving for 
Hiedelburg.  Tell me  
somet hing a bout your r el atio
nshi p and what it  me ant t o be  abl e to
 be t oget her i n a 
situation like this? 
A: Extre me l y i mportant to ha ve an
ot her body.  Not t o be a l one .  
Being alone, being isolate d wa s 
one of t he great da nge rs.  You j ust c oul dn™t hard
ly survive without having
 some one wit h you.  I  
re me mb er d a ys  w he n I  wa s v e ry  mu
ch isolated whenever  things ha
ppened.  Blancka 
ha d t o r un, I 
had t o run you know?   It  was , it 
felt , you reall y c oul dn™t li ve t hroug
h it.  But whe n Bla ncka le ft, it  
wa s a  gr eat loss to me . 
 We  maintained corre spondence in some  wa y, she was able to write from 
Ger ma n y, a nd t here wa s al ways s o me hope t ha t  pe
rhaps I™l l fi nd mysel f t h
ere , alt h ough I didn™ t  
believe it.  She encouraged
 me to go but how could I go?   For  me
 t he gr ea test da nger wa s to go to 
the offi cial e mployment bure au t o as k for a j ob b
ecause to go to Ger ma ny you ha d to a ppl y for a j ob 
there .  There  ha d t o be proof for  
a j o b there.  For  me j ust  to sh
ow my self, show my  fa ce in these  
office s was very danger ous .  So we mai ntai ne d ou
r contact mainly t hrough corr espondence at t hat  
point, but until the
n, we were extremely inter-de
pendent.  Her looks were 
helpful, I had more sens e 
of danger I think, of reality, I wa
s qui ck t his wa y for s o me r e a son. 
 I thi nk we comp
lemented each  
other  very well thi s wa y, but we we
r e very cl ose  to eac h othe r a nd as 
I  sa y,  we  were  inti mat e  i n o ur  
relationship and I knew of the losses she suffere
d.  She knew very much of
 my family life.  She  
tried to steal some oranges in the 
hospital to bring to La
sh-ick (ph) so we were very intert wi ned ,  
extre me l y s o .  And her a bse nce le ft a  tre mendous  
voi d in my life, but mor e
 than that, a sense of 
danger too, t hat I™ m all al one here .  I had no ide a th
e war was coming to an end.  Coming back to it, 
I remember Bowl-ick 
(ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph)
 and Lod-ja (ph), 
we had intermittent 
contact.  From the ti
me she had left until I joined
 her wasn™t that long.  
I™m trying to
 remember, I 
can™t r e member exactl y when she 
l e ft but some how wit hin
 t he next fe w months t he Ge r ma ns starte d 
running.  We heard about it
, that t h e Sovi ets ar e ap
proachi ng.  Even befo
re that , Blancka and I

celebr ate d e ach vi ctor y on the par t  of the Sovie t
s.  At one poi nt, we he
ard that Kol o myja was 
liberat ed a n d this ca me through the radio, the 
British ra dio, no, another c
ity, I™ m sor r y.  On the 
British radio, on that ra
dio we heard it later in 
Ger many.  So we cel ebrat e
d each time, quietly.  We 
had s uc h a double li fe , a n offici al li fe and a li fe
 bet wee n eac h other.  We  were e xtre mel y cl ose , I  
would say, in a very intimate kind
 of relationship.  We maintained
 it later for ma
ny decades too. 
But when she left, it was pretty, I 
did have some correspon
dence, I heard a little 
of it, that she was 
worki ng in a  house hold t here .  She 
di dn™t  see m to be  in da nge r of any 
kind, danger of detection.  It  
wa s very soon afterwards we hear
d r u mors that t he Soviets are ap
proachi ng, they are taking over  
large parts of Pol and, t he  easter n pa rt .  And one
 day, I r e me mber, t he Ger m
an famil y for whom I 
worked just took off to their to
wn in Ger ma n y and the y di dn™t  come
 back.  And with
in a few days, 
the offi ce worker s also l eft .  And t hen I was all al
one when I hear d that t h
e Soviets a r e  appr oac hing 
Wa rsa w , the y™re in Pra g ue, i n the s uburb of Pr
ague.  Being all alone, the telephone stopped 
worki ng, I would ha ve like to ca
ll Lodz, I would like to call Helena
 but I couldn™t, but I wa s all  
alone, I  figured, well, in
 a fe w hour s or so the  
Soviets  are  goi ng t o be he
re, so walk out of the 
apart ment .  Thi s was a Ger man sect ion, the Ger m
ans were not there anymor
e.  Ther e were Poles, 
and I  knew t he Soviets ar e comi ng i n.  I didn™t r eal
l y thi nk about my si ster
, Frania , s he wa s invol ved  
wit h the  chil d, I didn™t know ab
out M ene k, alt hough we did ha ve s o
me intermittent communication.  
At one point, prett y much
 ever yt hing s t opped, we  
didn™t know.  But I knew that
 I™m going to be fre e  
in a  fe w hours.  But t he  
Sovie t s did not  c o me i n.  And I  was all  al one  in 
that big apartment, not 
underst anding why they t ake s o mu
c h  ti me .  The followi ng morning, I 
bega n to he ar some s hooti ng.  
I later  found out  there was a n upri sing, t he  Poles  starte d a n uprising 
a gai ns t the  Sovi ets .  Thi s wa s  
beyond my  belief!  We ll,
 be for e  I kne w, the Ger m ans we re c o mi ng bac k a nd t he Pol e s see me d to be  
fi ghting both the Germans and the Soviets.  I wa lked 
out in the street to see 
what™s  ha ppening, I wa s  
terribl y isola t ed by then.  I saw pe opl e  runni ng.  Al
l the Poli sh people from the nei ghbor hoods were  
running.  I joined them, I didn™
t know why people wer e running. 
 And so we ke pt running, we  
move d sl owl y into se wer s.  Suddenly I™ m i n se wer s
.  And t he n the Polis h pe ople began t o talk a bout  
what ha ppe ned.  That the r e was a n uprising, that 
t he Soviet s didn™t c o me in, that t he Ger mans ar e

bac k.  And t hat t he city i s bein
g burned down.  We ll, I didn™t fe
el a mi nute anymore about being, 
the part about being Jewish
.  Thi s di d not, s o me how or  ot her , 
I ca n™t r e me mb er,  th
at Helin-ka ( ph)  
and Bowl -ic k (ph) j oined 
me .  I think we ran together but this 
i s what I™d li ke know, t o see Helin-ka  
(ph) t o find out t hese det ails.  
I don™t remember whether we, how ma
n y da ys we wer e  i n the se wer s ,  
but it seemed like an et er n
ity naturally.  And fr om 
time to time, th
e se wer door woul d open and you 
coul d se e a street a nd you c oul d he ar some  shoo
ting and t h en it would cl
ose aga i n and we  wer e  
agai n in the se wers .  I don™t re
me mb e r  ho w we w e re fe
d but somebody, there was some crumbs of 
food goi ng a round. 
Q: Were you in the water? 

A: In t he wa ter, tha t  high up.  And the se we re notthe se wer s of the ghe tto, these wer e the sewers of  

the city of Wa rsaw, Polish people.
  Some were in unif
orms, some were
 civilians, all 
age groups.  I 
didn™t know how far we were 
goi ng, what it was I t
hought  a day, but it wa
s more than a day 
definitely.  It was a good many da
ys, the idea was, I fo und out later,
 that we will be going up to the 

vesti bul ar where we wi ll get out a nd get a boat t o goto t he Sovi ets, t o Prague.  Fina lly we arrived a t  

the vesti bula r and Bowl-i ck (ph) a nd Hel-i nka (ph)
 and I , by t h e wa y, we wrapped ar ound oursel ves  
a bl anket so we  wouldn™t  
be  se para te d beca use  there wer e l ots  
of peopl e t h ere, we
 were afrai d we 
would be tor n apart .  And to come
 out in tha t  bri ght s uns hi ne , th
is was September 
of 1944, August,  
end of Au gust, beginning of Se ptem
b er, 1944.  And we tri ed to ge
t into a boat, there were many 
people  comi ng out of t he  se wer s, and 
we see t he ci ty is pr e
tty much in flames, an
d we try t o get on a  
boat.  We  cannot get in, it
™s filled, Bowl-ick (ph) go
t on the boat, Hel-inka (
ph) and I still waited for  
anot her  boat to c o me .  The Sovi ets 
are  right ac ros s the vesti bul a r , s o me pe ople were  tryi ng to s wi m  
it.  Suddenly from no where the Ger mans appear ed, 
the vesti bular is at the 
bottom of the city.  The  
i mport ant pa rt of t he _______ hill , the old cit y. 
 Sudde nl y, there are Ger ma ns in t he old cit y and 

fr om no where I feel a bullet in my
 ba ck.  The y shot me
 through my coat , I wa s in a coa t , and I ™ m 
blee ding.  And the  sa me  bullet  goe s i nto the  ar m of
 Hel- inka ( ph) .  I fell t o
 the  gr ound, she  di dn™t  I  
think.  I was pretty uncons
cious, I was bleeding. 
 And then they have 
us get up, I still don™t 
underst and how it was possi ble  for  me
 to be ble eding and ge t up, an
d we  are  bei ng marche d.  We

wer e a ppare ntly, I  found out  lat er,
 the last  gr oup of t he Polish upri
ser s.  And t he y a re dragging us  
through the city of Warsaw
.  We see the cit y 
i n fl ames, and t h ey ar e dr ag
gi ng me , I can hardl y drag. 
And al l of us ha ve t o put out a 
handkerchief or somethin
g to show to the Germ
ans our surrender.  
We  had to show somethi
ng white, flags we didn™t have, so ever
ybody raises a hand 
with a little shirt  
or s o met hing, we™re  surr endering.  I  coul dn™t  wal
k, pe opl e he lped me  or  wh
at, I don™ t re me mber . 
All I recall , at one point ,  I was extr emel y thir st
y, probabl y fr om l oss of bl
ood, and I bent down to 
pick up a n a pple .  Poland 
is full of or c hards, of apple orc har ds , i t
 was the season for it.  I tried to get 
an a pple int o my mout h and a Ger m an s oldi er hi ts 
me ri ght i n my bac k, mar ch!  He didn™t know I  
wa s Je wi sh, but t hen I was tot ally un
afr aid of bei ng detect ed as a Je
w.  I wa s a Pole.  They marched 
us to a pla ce outsi de of t o wn c alled Poroskov.  In 
Poros kov the y  had a spe cia l detenti on c a mp for all  
the Poles  who fought in t he upri sin
g a nd other Pol es t oo.  Lodz  eve n
t ually wa s i n Por os kov too but  I  
didn™t know at t hat ti me .  I wa s 
so si ck t hat I  wish I knew thes
e details because 
I didn™t functi on 
mentall y anymore.  But I recall wa
king up, there are somehow or othe
r bodies on top 
of me .  It wa s 
so cr owded there that  they pus he d peopl e, we 
fe ll asleep and the bodi
es , s o mehow or ot her  I  
snea ke d out of it .  Be fore
 I know it, I wa s on some
 transport bei ng ma rc hed ag
ai n to a pl ace t o be, to  
a pla ce t o be, a nti-l ous e d, me ans cle ane d of lice ,  a 
de-lousing station.  And 
t he n they put us on a  
train and I™m on a train with Hel-
li nka ( ph) hol ding ont o ea ch ot her and with lots of other Pole s.  
Polish fa milies, not chil
dr en, Poli sh men.  On that train, a nd 
by then it is Se pte mber I know, on t he  
train were t h e only t wo women and 
t h e men are all  in Polis
h uniforms, they
 were fi ghters.  The train 
wa s moving very slowl y, I had no i d
e a where we wer e moving, we fa
ll asleep all of us.  Sometime  
in the middl e of t he night, or it was very earl y mo
rning, one of the fi ghter s wa kes up and he starts  
talking to the other one, the Jews
 brought all the trage
dy and the Jews will take over Poland because  
of the Soviets and t h
ey got us into all that tr
oubl e.  And one of these g
uys looks  at t h e ot her a nd 
says , you know what, the se two girl
s acros s from us, they lo
ok Jewish.  You better tell.  By then it 
wa s about four i n the morni ng or 
so and it was just light
, it wa s just comi ng, 
and t hen t hey fell  
aslee p.  And without sa ying a not her word t o Hel- li
nka ( ph), we motione d to 
each ot her that we™r e 
goi ng t o j u mp fro m the train.  
I™m sure that  the mo
tivat ion wa s not  to e s
cape from that, the

motiva tion I belie ve, but I™ m not sure
, wa s to j ust die.  Be fore these Ger ma ns c o me to t ake us.  We  
underst ood by t hen t hat  the trai n 
was bei ng shi ppe d out to Stutt h
of, which was a de tention c a m p  
where Polis h pe ople  were  shi ppe d i n
 order to work for the Ge rmans.
  And we knew the beginning 
of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when
 the Germans arrived to ta
ke us out.  So without  
sayi ng a word to eac h other, t he wi ndow wa s op
en, the trai n wa s movi ng ver y slowly, I can™t  
re me mb er w ho ju mpe d fi rst.  An d I ca n™t re me mb e r  
anyt hing el se except t hat I wake up i n the home  
of a Polish woman in a 
town called Toe-mash-off-m
a us- off- yetski (ph).  I  never he ard of the town, 
it™s sout h of Warsa w .  The se women had at tended
 me , given me a  cle a n bed, atte nde d to my  

wounds , told me the st ory of what
 happened a fter I  woke up.  I don
™t know, it was a fe w days that I  
wa s pr etty unconsci ous.  She  sai d 
that  when we jumped out a priest
 thought we were
 dead.  He was 
goi ng t o t he ce meter y t o bur y s o me
 body, he s a w these  t wo gi rls fr
om the  Wa rsa w upri sing, s o he 
fi gur ed he™ s goi ng to bur y us, with
 a  dece nt Catholic burial .  Whe n 
he not ed t hat  we were breat hing. 
So fir st he buried t hese peopl e who he me ant t o bu
ry, the n he brought us 
to this Polish woman on 
the outskirts of Toe-mash
-off-maus-off-yetski (ph)
.  Poor  woma n but a very
 dece nt s oul .  She wa s  
very ha ppy t o be a ble t o  be of
 servi ce to these Poli
sh revol utionaries, t he 
Pol es who fought, the 
Poli sh fi ghte r s who fought for in
de pe nde nce of Warsa w.  So s he tr
eat ed us  beauti full y, I coul d see  
how poor she was but she treated 
us e xtre mel y wel l , and one da y a 
neighbor comes  in a n d she ope ns  
the door to our room a nd she wa nt
s to tell him, these are two girls 
who were in the Polish resistance 
move me nt .  He ta kes a l o ok at us and he sa ys, s he 
look Je wis h.  That ni ght , Hel-li nka (ph) was sic k  
of me because she looked Polish, 
she  said good-bye to 
me and I have n™t s een he r until  years a fte r  
the war .  I saw her agai n about t w

blonde a nd she wa nted out .  I 
staye d on, I di dn™t 
know what to do.  
The Polis h woman wa s  
absolutely an angel, she 
said you have to go, you 
can™t be her e.  She  wrapped up for me  hal f her  
brea d in a ke rchie f a nd t wo a ppl es and early morn
ing I lea ve.  I didn™t know wher e I was goi ng but ,  
it didn™t mat t er.  At t hat ti me , not hing matter ed a n
ymore.  I knew I wasn™t 
afraid at al l because I  
wa sn™t Je wi sh a nymore ,  nobody woul
d t hink of me as  Je wi sh at  th
at  point.  Pola
nd was falling 
apart .  I ke pt wal king, 
so I walked 
into town.

Q: You just said that 
it  didn™t matt er that you wer e Je wi

A: That ma n noti ced, but  on t he w
hol e pe ople  wer e alrea dy runni ng a nd 
li fe didn™t matt

was all alone, I was wounded, I had a 
pain i n my back.  I had nothi ng.
  I didn™t know where to go, I  
don™t thi nk I  had documents at th
at poi nt beca us e I was r unning i n
 the se wer s, I don™ t re me mber  
what happe n ed.  And I  don™
t re me mb er be ca
use I wa s on the high fever.  
So I walk into that town, I 
see Thom- ma-sla-sov-en- sky (ph), 
I never hea r d of i t  be for e, t her
e are two Thom-ma-slick™s (ph), 
one  is  _____________ 

the ot her ____________ is the home  
of Ra bbi Lowengers ( p h) br othe
r .  The y pr ee mi nentl y ga ve  
testimony about their experiences as children in camp s.
  So I walk in, I hardly
 walk, but I walk with  
the apples and the bread.  I s
ee an apothecar y for phar ma cy.  
European phar maci es are ver y  
di ffere nt t ha n ours , t he y™ r e very for m al.  I ha d not h
ing t o l oos e , I walk in, 
I sa y I am a, I ran away 
fr om the upr i sing, I fought in t he upri sing bec aus
e this was my ne

a little bit about pharmacological wo
rk because my husband was a phar
macist, I use to help him, he 
is deli ghted to se e me , he s ays . 
 Well, first I wanted to rest up
, I wa nt ed to m
eet my  fa mil y ,  
tomorrow you co me to work
.  You can do bottles, yo
u can wash up, fi ne.  He
 sends me up
stairs to 
his fa mil y, a  nice home t hey ma de
, his wi fe was char mi ng t o me , 
the mai d makes a l u xuri ous be d 
for me, I felt  so guilt
y to get into that bed with
 beautifully clean linen.  I 
haven™t seen that in a long 
ti me , star ched linen I remember .  
And they invite me fo r dinner a
nd eve r yt hing™s fine .  And I sleep  
through the night and in the morn
i ng the maid come s i n sa yi ng, sh
e ™ s ver y  sorr y but  he r landla dy  
told he r how sorry s he was but I ca nnot stay here 
any longer.  I think, ah- o h, the y dis covere d where  
I was .  So I  say, what happene d?   She sa ys, i n
 the mor ning when you 
got up I made the be d, I  
noticed t her e were li ce in your

you shoul d go b

 Well, I still reme

they star ted worki ng on

out  total l y.  And I  hear  t he nur se
 saying to the doctor, 
you know, she looks Jewi
sh.  Here I™m in the  
hos pital , i n t he e mergenc y r oom.  Nothing happe ned
 and not hing matt ered at  that poi nt, I wal ke d  
out , I knew I  wa s banda g ed.  I didn™t
 have lice .  I fi gur ed should I go
 back there, it™ s really not the  
place for me  to go back, I™ m afrai
d.  By then it was very lat e even
ing, I was ext remel y tired.  I was 
still so very sick.  I ate those appl
es and the rest of the bread and I 
stretched out on a bench.  It was a  
cold ni ght , i t  was by then I thi nk t he e nd of Sept
ember, beginning of Octo
ber.  It  was raini ng ,  
drizzli ng, and I fell asl ee p and nothi n g matter s.  
Sometime in the 
middle of the night, some body 
pus hes me .  I ope n my e yes .  A Ger ma n sol dier ,  
a Ger ma n police ma n.  Come , he sa ys to me .  I  
wa sn™t a frai d.  He didn™ t  know in t h e mi ddle of
 the night that 
I wa s Je wi sh or  anythi ng, he wa s  
collect ing all  these home l ess people to ship t he m ou
t to Ger ma ny.  So he br ings me aga i n to a pl ace  
for cle ani ng, de-l ousi ng, clean, I wa l k out cle an.  
I thi nk t he y  gave me somet hing fr es h to wear, I 
don™t re me mber.  And he  brings me
 t o an assembl y hall where there 
are lots of Polish women.  All 
these wome n, coll ected from the st reet, are bei
ng shi pped to Ger ma ny to wor k.  By then the 
Ger ma ns  we re lo osi ng  th e war,  th eir me n where  c o
ming home on crutches.  
T heir  wo men wer e  s e nt  
to the fr ont t o wor k.  They didn
™t have enough wo rker
s so t hey were collec
ting Polish people all  
over .  I™ m a mong Pole s, there fore  nobody knows I™ m 
Je wis h.  But, we get  on a trai n, a nd t he n the 
ma n who is a gree ter 
tell s us we are going to go t o  Ger ma n y 
to work but before 
we do we are g oin g  
to stop i n Pa t-o-vi ch-a (ph), which i s a bor der t o
wn whic h by t hen wa s Ger ma ny.  And he ta kes us 
out and he s ays , I want you to sit in t his cor ner , we
 were a fe w hundred people by then, to sit in this 
corner and t o wait for t h e eveni ng. 
 We  are going to take
 a n eve ning trai n a nd I™ ll c o me  ba ck i n t he  
evening.  We know you™ll s
it and rest here
, will being some food
.  I took a look 
at the group and I 
didn™t know whether I looked at 
t he m or t hey looke d at  me but it
 di dn™t  look to me kos her t hat  I  
could survive with these Poli
sh gr oups.  So I s aid, if
 I have to be back and 
see i f I could wal k away 
a little bit, so I walked aw
ay.  And here I could see 
Germany falling apart.  
Many Polish people of 
Ger man ext r action, fal k- stoich-er (ph), are comi ng 
into the station.
  The y  are  runni ng from the 
Soviets.  And at t he stati on t here are ma ny soup
 kitchens  supervis ed by 
German nurses, like the  
Ger ma n Re d Cr oss .  So I  hear t heir st ory a bout

toich- er ( ph) , why not?   I spea k 
German better than 
they.  So I go over and I 
ask for soup and I tell them that I™m running fr om the 
Soviets  so t hey gi ve me  one  cu
p of soup a nd a not her c up of s oup
 and a third cup of soup.  I 
remember milk so distinctl
y, fi nally I am full, I™ve 
eaten good food.  
And this is a Sunday afternoon 
I believe and I walk out of
 t he  stati on.  Pat-o- vic h- a (ph) i s no
t touc he d, i t  is  a Ger ma n c ity, it™s an 
industrial  cit y, i t was the biggest  textil e cit y aft e
r Manchester, I knew about 
it.  And I see the stores 
full of fa brics, I couldn™t believe 
what™s going on here. 
 I came from the ashe
s, literally fr om the 
ashe s of Pol and.  And I wal k a nd 
I don™t know where t o wa lk, I fi
gur e I have t o wal k awa y fr o m  
that Polish group.  Let™
s see i f I can get to He
idl e bur g beca use I™ m wa nt ed
 in Ger ma ny, and si nc e 
ever ybody™s running.  I™ m 
not J e wis h, e ver ybody™s runni ng, t he Ge
r ma n, t he fal k-st oic h-er ( ph) ar e  
running, the  Poles  are r unning. 
 The Poles  c ouldn™t  run t h ey 
ar e t oo _____________ but t he  
Ger ma ns  we re runni ng fr om 
their home .  So I  
se e a Hitl er pa rade , a nd bel i
eve it or not, this is the 
funniest thing in my life
!  I joined the Hitler pa
rade and I go like this, 
Heil Hitler!  Heil Hitler!  
_______________.  First  th
ey had soldiers i n br own shoes , bu
t then people talk
e d, it wa s Sunday  
afternoon, I think it was for Hitler™
s birthday, I™m not sure, but it 
was a special occasion.  So I 
walked with them unt il the evening, then they disperse. 
Q: What™s  your  stat e of mi nd 
whe n you joi ned
 this parade? 
A: Oh, I was so exhilarate
d.  I was absolutely exhi
larated.  Imagine 
me to join a H
itler parade!  I™m 
in Germany!  This still br
ings to me laughter when ever I think about that 
moment!  How did I do it, 
but what else could I do?  I was in
 t he s a fest  pla ce to be  for me .  
In a Hi tler parade
!  I™m together 
wit h all t hese Ger mans saluting t h
e fl ag and al l the things, and th
ere are speeches and so on.  Many 
hours pa ss a nd the eve ni ng co mes a n d the y be gin to 
disperse , so I have no plac e to go.  I fi gured 

these Pol e s must ha ve le ft , but I™ m not sure .  So I  
circle around the stati on. 
 I wasn™t afraid because 
people were on the ma rch by the n you see.  The y were
 refu gees.  This was the 
best feeli n g for me.  I  
come  ba ck, i nde ed, t he peopl
e ar e gone.  So I t ake 
a look, what a m I goi ng 
to do?  Now I™ll try to 
get on a trai n and fi nd my  wa y t o He
i d lebur g, I kne w Bla nc ka was there .
  I had some idea of where, 
the pl ace where peopl e fr om 
Bol m-sukkot (ph) wo
rked.  I got t o, it™ s late evening by then, I get on a

train and I suddenly noti
ce the military train from Ru
ssia, the Ger mans, all 
military, I™m the only  
woma n.  I say, oh, that ™s very danger ous , so I hide 
in the restroom.  In an 
hour or so, they need the  
restroom and start yelling to get ou
t, I get out, t he y look at me , and 
by s he er luc k be ca use I have to 
think it was luck you know, 
the train stops.  It wa s th
e cit y of Dresden.  So 
I walk out at the station 
and the train goes a wa y, it goes wher ev
er they we nt.  I wal k, i t  was ve ry quiet I re me mber.  It wa s 
by then, was  mor ni ng, ea rly mor ning 
hours.  I wal k into t o wn and I s
it down in a ca fe, I  didn™ t ha ve  
mone y but I  fi gur e I would s it down,
 rest stop.  And s o
 the new bombs came. 
 This was the great 
bombing of Dresden, 
it was an earlier bo
mbing.  You see R-
A-F, this was the British Air Force.  
The bes t  fee ling i n thi s world, that I ™ m goi ng t o 
die of a bomb, wh at can 
be better?   
I remember 
eve n bombs  in Wars a w .  At one
 point, the British were bombi
ng Wa rsa w and I staye d in a 
house hol d there, not wit h  the Ger m
a n s, it was i n a  Poli sh place , I 
ha d a furnishe d room, and people  
were running to shelter. 
 So these  pe ople  call ed me , 
c o me!   Co me  wit h  u s  to
 the shelt er!  And I di d 
ever ythi ng possi ble not to go to t he s helter , I wa nted to be kill ed by a bomb.  Coul dn™t be a bette r  
death.  And I recall doing 
this, putting my feet up 
and my head into my le
gs, hoping that when a 
bomb kills me that it will kill all of
 me rather than just some legs 
or the head separates.  This was 
my dream, to be killed that way. 
 I really didn™t want to live, so
 when people say they tried to 
survive, they want ed to live, I really di dn™t want
 to live  but I di dn™t want t o di e detecte d by t he  
Ger ma ns .  I wa s a fr a id o f  that d
eath.  But I™ve seen before how peop
le were killed 
and their leg wa s 
hung t here  a nd I was t he r e and t his
 t o me was a horror, so I reme
mber that ni ght 
of bombi ng.  I  
didn™t go to the shelter 
but I waited for the bomb, th
e bomb di dn™t come
 to me.  So th
is is Desden, 
and I sit in a cafe and the second fl
oor of that cafe is coming down
 and I™m sitting there literally,  
seeing t he bombs , a nd t h ings ha ppe n, it™s like an e art
h-s ukkot ke, you know?   It sounds l ike a n eart h-
sukkot ke .  And I see ma ny pe ople ar e  dead i n the st
reet and here I wal k out  
alive.  I was me ant t o 
live and that™s all they can
 say, why I 
wasn™t killed I don™t kn
ow.  So hours later,
 I walked 
down to 
the railway station.  I still have in
 mind if I™m alive I want to go to
 Heidleburg, so I get a train.  It 
wa s some sort of a civi lia n train.  Nobody l ooke d 
a t  doc uments, nobody looked at ti cke t s, it was s o  
chaotic.  It was mainl y refugees
 fr om the falk-stoic
-er ( ph) , fro m ever ywhere , and Ger ma ns t o o

fr om t he cit i es, t her e were bombs, 
they were moving west , that™s how it wa s going.  But mainly 
fr om t he e as t ern part of Ger ma n y, which was ori gin
ally Poland.  Finally I 
see  thi s tra i n st ops at  
Fra nkfurt a nd be fore I  get out bombs c o me  ove
r Frankfurt, this was 
a little bit too much, 
unbelievable.  But this was the ti
me  of the  gr eate st  bombi ng of Ger m
any.  So the railway station is 
all in fire again an
d many passengers walk ou
t alive and many pa
ssengers are kille
d right there. 
And I™m ali v e.  It™s fantas
tic!  So I figured, now I 
have to go fr om Fr ankfur t to Heidle burg, c ertai nly 
no tr ains anymore, the rai lway st a
tion is all in flames.  I see peop
le walking, I follo
w them, they are 
wal king to t he hi ghway to hitc hhike .   So I h
itc hhike t oo, I™ m a Ge r man
 you know!  I™ m a falk-
stoic h-er ( ph), poor, dear soul .  I™
m better qualified to be 
falk-stoich- er (ph) th

And t he y st art hit chhiki ng, s o I  get  on a tr uck, I  
re me mb er t he tr uc k g oe s  
only a little place, h e  
leaves me t h ere, I had to hitchh

modes of trans port ation, fi nall y a  
train goes some where  be t wee n Mannhei m and Hei dleburg
.  I ar rive at Hei dl ebur g, I ar ri ve i ntact  in 
Hei dle bur g.  I walk int o t h
e ladies room to wa sh up
 and I wash up and I l ook 
in the mirr or a nd I  see  
a chimney behind me , a chimney sw
eep, and I figure how does a 
man come into this?  I look  
around, he™ s  gone .  So, I was h my ha nds a gai n, I lo
ok agai n a nd I see the chi mney s w eep is ba ck!  

And I  l ook back, it™ s not  a

it was  me, not a  c hi mne y s we ep!   I  wa s s o blac k, I  
was so totally black cove

was my face, it was not a chimney 
s w eep.  _________ _______.  I wa
sh my  fa ce, I suddenly had a 
fa ce and it was me.  I 
still have that sense of terr
or in me when I think about 
it.  I walk out, the cit y  
is nor mal and beauti ful a

remember the name of her employer
.  So I stop a little girl and I sa
y to her, do you know Mr. Alber  
(ph)?   And s he sa ys , My papa!  Li ke t hat.  The r e a r e 
miracles in this world. 
 My pa pa!  She takes me 
by my hand and s he bri ngs me t o Blanc ka.  Bla n
cka nearl y fai nted when
 she s a w me t he way I  
looked.  She took me to
 t he base me nt  to was h me up a nd put
 s o methi ng ar ound 
my wounds, I was  
not  in such good 
sukkot pe yet , a nd s he fi gur ed
 I should wait a fe w days 
before I go to work.  She 
had meanwhile arranged for me to 
work for a couple, for 
a fa mil y, i n the neig
hborhood.  This was  
no one  els e but Profe ss or A- had- es ( ph), he was  a d
ean of t he medical  school  
in Hei dle burg.  A hi gh  
ranki ng Ger ma n offici al  in a uni for m, he was a bout 
7™ tall.  He has a wife wit h four  childre n, a  
stunning house, abs olut el y be auti fu
l house.  There wer e 
bedr ooms  and atti cs .  The y hired me  on the  
spot , I  start e d wor king.  The  wor k
 was impossible for me
, I wa s not well  yet you s ee ?   And t hey  
gave me an attic room.  I had 
to get the children, clean everythi
ng, there were ma
ny floors there,  
beautiful, their house.  And in the morning I woul
d have t o  get  the c hil dren to sc hool, eac h chil d 

leavi ng for s chool with t he, Heil 
Hitler, Maria!  This was the gr
eeti ng, the morni ng greeting.  The 

lady of the hous e wa s s or t  of ne ut
ral.  She didn™t trust 
me with cooking, there 
was nothing to cook. 
It was toward the end of the war, the Germans ha
d very little, but they ha d a garden.  Everyday, I 
had t o go t o  the gar de n and dig out potat oes and 
leek.  And ever yda y, we had a n ele gant l unc h of  
potatoes and leeks.  I would scrape it off, prep
are it, but she would cook it because you put a little 
bit butt er and a little fl our and make 
it look like more of a meal .  It wa
s ser v ed in bea uti ful porcelai n  
wit h silver ware, you would ne ver t h
ink what you wer e eati ng, it wa s 
gre at food.  Ever yday the sa me  
until the end of the war. 
 We  had all, for getting rations of fo o
d.  Everybody was a
ssigned that many 
grams of bread, so I had a little.  
He registered me as 
a fa lk-stoich-er
 (ph), which wa
s great.  S o  
which means I was entitled to a littl
e bit more bread.  So, I would 
get whatever am
ount of bread, 
just a little bit less than they 
did.  On Sunday,
 everybody had pork.  
A roast of pork and the 
Professor would slice it, trying to 
be fair to ever yone.  Then he wo
uld slice a some what thinner pa rt,  
this is for Maria!  He didn™t 
know much German, I kne
w, because just spoke it haltingly in a way, 
because she gets a little less.
  But, I still had a 
portion.  This wa
s one soup, they di
dn™t have either , 
except t hat  he went a 
fe w ti mes to Yugoslavia on trips.  A
nd he  would bri ng some  peac hes  fro m  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379

there and he brought some assort ment
 of fo ods.  We ll, th
is house hol d was a ver y
 ele ga nt hous ehold .  
The y woul d have c ultur e eve nings, e v enings  of cul t
ure.  At  whi c h poi nt t he y
 woul d i nvit e about 20,  
30 pe opl e like a symphony orc hes tra  they woul d play
.  These were doctors mo st of them, famo us  
lawyers, jewelers, you kn
ow?  And I would set up the chairs
 and everybody w
ould get a little bit  
coffe e or somet hing but ever ythi
ng wa s ver y ele gant .  The s e tting wa s al wa ys ve ry el ega nt.  One  
day, he comes home  from one of his sudde n tri ps an
d he  br ings s o me ver y sp
eci al food and the lady  
wra ps it up on a tray a nd she sa ys t o me t o go t o that nei ghbor , to bri ng a present fr om t he El- ha de s  

(ph) family.  I wal k ther e, one 
of the  most st unni ng houses I ™ ve ev
er se en, I couldn™t belie ve the 
garden at t h at house.  I  r ing th
e bell and the maid says
, no, no, t he  mai d™ s e n
trance is through the 
kitchen.  I come into the kitchen 
and I  leave that pr esent .  Then I 
fi nd out wh o now 
was this fa mily , 
was Speer.  Albert Speer™s
 pa rent s.  I  didn™t know.  They ga
ve  me the na me Sp
eer , t he name Speer  
didn™t me an anyt hing t o me .  Th
e y want t he move me nt bet we e n hi st
or y and per sonal experie nce  but 
that™s true fo r all survivors.  
Well, it was an extremel
y be auti ful neighbor h
ood, some thi ng like our  
Scotishville (ph), a very fi ne s
ection of the city.  And Blancka 
worked in her 
household and I 
worked in mine.  For me
 the wor k was unbelie va bly he avy, I coul dn™t do i t .  I just didn™t have the  
strength of rolling out these very
 heavy rugs, carpets.  Putting them
 on the snow and beating them 
on t he snow because most Eur opean
s belie ved that  when you beat th
ese hea vy c arpe t s on the sn o w  
that t hey get speci al tr eat ment.  
To roll it up, to carry 
it from this, one day I re
me mb er I sa w pl ane s ,  
allied planes fl ying over, very much
 over me.  I could nearly talk to
 them, I felt it was so, but I felt  
that day I remember, gee,
 the Americans are 
coming, or the 
British, or whoever it
 was, but I won™t 
live t o see t h em, I was so sick of 
wor k, I  was so ti red of
 work.  One day I fell 
off the st airway, they 
had stair ways to di ffer ent  fl oor s.  And I ripped my
 face and I t hink I had a 
few days of rest and a 
hospital, the best time of 
my li fe!  I neede d the re st so ba d.  To dig out in t he col d snow, t o di g out  
potat oes e ve r yda y.  To ta ke care of four chil dren.  To
 do the laundry.  To clean the house.  To beat 
those car pets.  All of thi s  was a 
li ttle bit too muc h  for one per s on. 
 Bla ncka  was wit h si x chil dre n 
and the German lord™s poin
t was if a woman has a fa
mily of six children th
ey were entitled to one 
and a half help.  If they had 
four children you were entitled to 
a foreign worker, 
I was a foreign

worker .  I f you had ei ght  childr en you we re enti tl
ed to t wo, i f you ha d si
x you were ent itled to one  
and a hal f.  So Bl anc ka ha d anothe r hal f there , that 
hal f late r we found out was als o Je wis h.  She stil l  
lives in Tacoma, Wa sh
ington, I  kne w  her .  Bl anc k a and I  were  ver y cl ose ly relate d i n te r ms  of our  
days off.  Our day off was Wedn
es day a fter noon and oc casi o nally we would go to the  Uni versit y,  
snea k in, but  mo st of t he ti me we would go t o thi s
 beautiful forest because 
t heir houses, the suburb 
wa s in forest .  Mos t  bea ut i ful se ction of t he cit y. 
 There wa s a l ovel y cafe 
c alled Br os-pr on-e ur (ph) . 
It was cut  out of an idylli c ki nd of
 a place.  It  wasn™t tr ue, it wasn™t  
possi bl e.  That is t h e pl ace when 
we hear d tha t  the Ger ma ns ha ve plans, acc or ding to
 their plans that they 
wit hdre w , they withdre w  
fr om our home town.  These were th
e ne ws we  wo uld  g e t,  we  k ne w t h
at they were loosing.  But it 
was still very much inside Germ
any and little by little I felt I probably will not survive the heavy 
labor .  I wa s not a frai d of bei ng det ected bec aus e 
I was only afraid of the Poles, I wa s not, the 
Ger mans wouldn™t know the di fference, that ™s a f
act.  But goi ng down to mar ket for t he m and all  
these things, it was uphill, 
it was very difficult to ca
rry all of that.  But I th
ought I would survive th e 
war  i f I coul d survi ve my health. 
 I c oul dn™t  take that hea vy la bor . 
 We ll, one day, the ma n of the 
house  come s  in and he  sa ys, it l ook
s  a s though the re is  s o me fi ght
i ng going on, we would be bette r 
off being in the basement at nigh
t.  Not to stay abov
e because you coul d see all  the airpl anes.  I  
didn™t liste n to the ra dio, I didn™
t know muc h, but  I got it fr om thei
r faces that things are not going 
well fo r the Germans.  I 
di dn™t  know how cl os e.  So he  sa id
 t hat ni ght  we sh
oul d stay in th e  
base me nt .  So we al l go down to t he ba se me nt
 and s o meti me e a rly mo rning I see t his ma n, wh o 
always wore the high mil
itary uniform, he use 
to be in Berlin with Hitle
r, you know, he was a very  
big shot.  But he™s in hi
s civilian clothes, it hang
s on him it just looks like
 a diminished ma n.  And  
he dri ve out  of the gar a ge wit h thi s  car and 
the  car has a l ittle white flag.  And I still don™ t 

understand what was going o
n.  Later in the mornin
g, he comes back with 
a little bandage over his 
hand, he wa s wounde d slightl y in 
the  street fi ght .  He and t he ma yor of t he  city and s o me body els e  
went to Mannheim to surrender th

have t o c elebrate.

A: Oka y.  It™ s one of t he joys , me

Fra uline s!  We ha d to make now, M unic h, he wa nted

to sa y, Yi dden!  Yi dde n!   Yi dde n!  
We ™re J e ws!   Well he is , but he has 
to keep rolling, so he throws 
us two cartons of cigarettes, of 
the ci garett es t he war  was over, yo
u know?  Well, I go back and I  
fi gure this the end of my workin
g for the Germans.  Although 
the war was stillgoing on, but I™m 
not going back to work there.  I 
went back and I refuse
d to work, but I still ha

Herr  Profess or i n his civi lian out
fit by then, it was like 
a di mi n i she d  ma n,  a n
 unbelievable change, 
what ha ppens to the uni f or m, t he hi gh ranking uni
for m whe n you ha ve to l

the Herr Professor, this is
 his wi fe , he sends her up 
to talk to me.  And he 
wants  me, he™ s conc erne d 
that hi s wi fe  said I™ m not  wor king. 
 And that he wants me 
t o, he wa nts t o know wha t  my pla ns ar e. 
I sa y, I don™ t  know, I gue ss I™ll  go bac k
 to Pola nd.  So he s ays, you kn

not so good for 
you to go ba ck to Pola nd. 
 After all you're an ethn
ic Ger ma n, t he Pole s ma y no
t treat you so well.  I  
said, I™ll take a chance.  He says, but I have a better plan fo r you.  He
re in the village is a mort-k-eye

they wil l  arr ange for you 

to be a sales girl there.  You

 And he notice along th

Q: You mean the Amer

A: The Americans, yes. 
 So I  figur ed s o met hing ma y happen. 
 A night  or t w o nights be fore , he  
wa nte d me t o dig a hole in the ga rde n where he 
put s o me guns.  He hid gun
s ther e.  And Blanca™ s  
people hi d wine.  Bottl es of wine .  The y we re
 prepar ed for the Ameri
cans, you know, so the  
Ameri cans ma y want , he hid guns t h er
e.  And I fi gure d it™s not good for me
 to be there at this point. 
We didn™t know where to go.  I sa
id to Bl ancka, I say, I™m not wo
rki ng a nymore.  She s ays , I™ m not  
working either.  We go down to
 look at these tanks and the ta
nks keep rolling, but we have no 
mone y, ther e™s no money,
 there™s  not hing t o buy. 
 We  went into town, 
ever yt hi ng i s clos ed. 
Hei del bur g i s tot ally cl os ed up, not  
one store is open.  And 
so we  de cided t o li ve i n t hes e fiel ds  ne ar  
the hi ghway.  We slept there and we 
ate grass.  I™ll  never for get  aft e
r the war, the fi
rst few days we 
ate grass.  It ™s hard to 
be lieve  it.  We  dec i de d not
 to go back.  And there 
wa s not hing to do but  o n  
the third day I think we realized
 perha ps we c oul d do somet hing wi
th these cigarettes.  So we 
wal ke d int o town a nd i n dee d, we knocked at t he  
door s and we t old, cigarettes , ci gar ettes, t r adi ng  
somet hing, a nd t he y gave us  some
 food.  Fi nall y we  fo
und our wa y to a place , a n Ameri ca n Red 
Cross c l ub.  That pl
a ce wa s to serve  donuts  and 
coffee to Ameri can sol d ie
rs.  It must have been 
within a week or two, I don™t re me mb er.  We  told 
the guys  tha t  we wer e Je
wis h an d t ha t  we we re 
slave  laborer s her e and c oul d they 
do somet hing for us, c ould they gi
ve us a job?  They agreed to 
have us serve the boys.  
So if I speak English in 
a  funny wa y, that™s  the pl a ce where I  pi cked up my  
Englis h.  I never we nt to school , 
thi s wa s my s c hool .  I ser ve d co
ffee a nd donuts and 
Blancka too.  
Was a great  life.  We got a fur n
is hed room bec ause for the  donuts 
we wer e  abl e  to  trade .  We  
brought dozens of do
nut s to a place where t hey
 had a furnis hed roo m all  
ready.  Then we deci ded 
we need to learn English.  So we went to a Ge
r ma n woman who wa s a teac her of Engli s h.  Ga ve he r  
a doze n of donuts and she taught 
us Englis h.  To the beaut y parl
or for donuts , eve r yt hing was for  
donuts bec a use there wa s no food an
d we ha d ac cess t o as many donuts 
a s we wa nte d  to.  So thi s 
put us  on our feet .  One  day, 
a  ma n co mes  in , i n  an  
out fit fr om Ausc hwi t z, I  di dn™ t know about  
Ausc hwitz, I  had no idea  where he 
was fro m, but he wor e one  of th
ese paj a mas a nd he  told us he  
was in Auschwitz, told us his stor
y.  And he says, he ne
eds to talk to the milita
ry governor, he needs 
some document to go and fi nd his 
wi fe, but he doe sn™t s pea k Englis h.
  So I said, I s pea k Englis h, I™l l

take you there.  I come to the m
ilitary governor and he has refugee 
assistant and I interpret for this 
man and the military governor turns 
to his assistant and sa
ys, what language does
 she speak?  That 
wa s my  English.  I stoppe
d goi ng for  Engli sh less ons
 to this woman, she ta
ught me  i n  a wa y t hat  
wa s no Engl ish!  I thought I s poke Englis h.  Sl ow
ly I lea r ne d the  langua ge a nd slowl y a ma n ca me 
in from underground, M r . Voli nger 
( ph) , and he starte d hel pi ng us 
in whatever way.  Eventually, 
they or ga niz ed, the  Ame rican Red 
Cross  or ganiz ed a  tra ns port of truc ks  t o go t o Tre n cin-s ch-s t at

Fra nkfort, M anc heste r , s o me othe

 And they ask i f an
ybody spe aks Russi an, I  
vol unte er to spea k Russia n. 
 So they attach me, th
ey put me in a uni form, some American soldiers  
uni for m, and I go wit h the m t o Tre ncin- sc h-stat  (
ph)  and I  say, be for e you
 go we have to cross 
Russia n bor ders.  We have t o ta ke cha-soc ks 
( p h), wat che s and a lot of Vodka.  They don™t  
underst and, I say, tr ust me .  That is  what we wil l  need.  Wel l , th

Karl sbad, where my sister use to

We ha ve a s quar e sta mp, they want a round sta mp. 
 And I sa y, where is your supe rvis or?   Oh, he™s  
taking a bath.  A bath?   We ™ll wait.
  The y sa y, oh no, he li kes to be

further.  Fi nally, it was e veni ng, we arrive in Ti lsi t -en-s hot ( ph), it™s high up.  Thi s sce n e I™ll never

convoy of truc ks , of busse s a ctuall y

who were de porte d to Tr enci n-en-s

they don™t know who™s  a live, wh

room, a tre mendous room in the castle
.  It™s all dar k. He says, wait he
r e, I s hould wait .  He l oc ks t he 
door on the outsi de and I™ m all al one
 in that pl ace.  It
 wa s a horr or.  My onl
y thought  wa s, i n th e  
morning, the truck will pi
ck me up and I™ll go to Siberia becaus e that was the Russi
an way.  I didn™t  
wa nt to lie down, I wa s s t andi ng bec a use I was a fr aid
 of ra ts.  I  was standing
 there the whole night, 
waiting for the morning to be take
n out, no matt er  wher e.  He co
mes in the mornin
g, he  takes me  
out , he brings me ba ck t o the Ame r i can Red Cr

know what happened.  I 
assume , bec ause I s poke  Russia n and 
I wor e an Ameri can uni for m, t hat 
they took me fo r a spy.  Or  
perhaps these guys intervened fo r 
me, I still don™t know. 
 We came back with 
a handful of people, 
the worst of people fr om Hei dlebur g from t hese pl aces
.  All I r ecall, when I  crossed the bor der int o  
German t erri tory, I nearly 
kiss ed the  l and.  That 
was how you do wit h Sovi et
 Russia.  There, I met 
two girl s in Russia n uni f or ms fr
om my  home town .  Th ey were in
 the ar my, they work with the 
victor ious ar mie s, they wer e 
marchi ng.  And they tol d me th
at the y sa w Blanca™s hus ba nd in  
Krakow™.  So, I told that he come back from Russ
ia, so I went back to He
idleburg, I told Blancka 
about it, she coul d ha rdl y wait .  Sh
e wanted to go to Kr
akow™ to meet her husb
and, naturally.  So we  
bot h leave t he job at the Ameri can
 Re d Cros s.  The r e was a  big re
patria t i on move me nt the n, t he y 
wer e patr oiti ng all of t he se pe ople t o Pol and and 
t here was a tr uck l oad of Pol es comi ng back fro m 
Ger ma n y as slave la bor s into Pola nd. And all t hat  talk you he ar is an
ti-Semitic talk in that truck .  

We  were j u st about to cros s th
e  border i nto Cz echoslova kia  to go to Poland a nd I  hear t he s e  
comme nts a nd it was a stop for us .  I say to Bl
anc ka, you know what?   
I™ m not going bac k to  
Pol and.  I couldn™t go ba ck to Pola nd, I coul dn™t hear
 that talk.  Here I was 
already in Ameri ca, in a 
wa y, the  Ameri ca n Red Cr oss .  She  wa s quite  de
sper ate about our separ a

wa nte d to fi nd her hus b and.  Sh
e come s to _______
___ hers elf later , s he  
found her husband with  
anot her  woman.  He  marr ied a woma

so I went back to He

whi l e.  Some how or ot her , they had di splac ed pe
rs ons c a mps , you know?   I wa s goi ng fr om one i nto  
anot her.  One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the 
Red Cr os s the y sent me to
 Ohrdr u f bec ause I spok e  
languages.  I knew a little Englis

Polish, I knew German, so
 I was useful in an 
office .  And some body a ppr oac hes 
me saying, is t here a Maria Neider here?  Maria Nei der!  Mene k

phoned.  He literall
y walked through Po
land and Germany fr
om, so this was, 
how do you know?  
It™s Menek and he brought ne ws that Frania is  
alive and he mentioned that they all came to 
Ger many and I got t hem a ho
use near Hei dlebur g 
because I had the rat ions, f
ood, I  had al l that stuff.  
I™ m i n the uni for m, you sa w my ye
ar s of __________. 
 And t hey s ent me to A-r os e-en (ph), a f ter I  
worked in Frankfort first.  Frankf
ort on Hurst , that  was the onl y buil ding that was t he G.I. far m a nd  
fa ctor y.  The  onl y buildings t he Ameri cans  le ft i nta ct
 in Frankfort because th
ey thought t hey™ll  ne ed  
it for their military governme
nt later, so it was.  
So I worked there, Mene
k fo und me there.  And  
then they transported all of un
known pe ople  to A-rose- en (ph).  
They had the Ger mans leave t he 
city, this was  a subur b of t he city of Ca stle (ph) . 
 There wa s big c astles there , big vill age .  And Own-
Rae (ph) took over the town.  And they sent me
 t here and I had a n a part me nt wit h a not her woman 
fr om America, she wa s of Polish orig
i n, Mari a Lei berskint .  We lived 
there and li fe wa s pretty good.  
And my si st er lived i n Heidle bur g, I would c o mmut
e and bri ng food, I woul d 
always bring all these 
things.  I ha d a ve ry i nt eresti ng j ob, it wa s in 
t he traci ng, we wer e tra cing chil dre n who were  
disp erse d i nt o Ger ma ny .   No Je wis h  chil dre n we re
 in question.  But repr
esent atives of di fferent  
governme nt s , Poli sh, Yugosl avia n, Hung
aria n, Cr oatia n, you j ust na me  
it, they came to
 our zone t o 
clai m t he children.  They wanted 
to fi nd their children.  And the 
job of t he Onra h (ph) pers onnel  
whi ch I s upe rvise d for no good r eas on but t hat I kn
e w the la nguages a nd I ha
d an educ ation, all  of  
this worked in my favor.  They were field worker
s to find chil dren.  Many of t hese chi l dren didn™t  
spea k a ny of t heir nati ve langua ge s, you had t o
 identify them by some 
symbols  or  whate ver . 
Sometimes they uttered a 
word, sometimes they wore
 a cross which looked li
ke a Sla vonic t hing. 
So me  of these things, we found ma
ny of t he m.  And we woul d always
 bring them to 
the attention of 
these li aisons fr om thei r countries and they were
 shippe d i mme diate l y to 
their countr i es.  Today I  
a m not s ure I woul d do t hat a s ea sily beca use  y
ou wa nte d to put chil dren 
and were alrea dy obs erve d  
by Ge r man  fa mi lies , wh at 
that separation meant, but
 those days t her e was no
 question that these  
childr en have to be re moved fr om Ge r ma ny, the be
long to their fa milies. 
 So me ti mes t he fa mili e s  
were not available, but they belonge
d to their nations, to 
their countries.  So 
these things, my staff 
we nt to sc hools  to fi nd the m,

fa milies because fa milies didn™t want
 to tell us and it was detective wo
rk to fi nd, beca
use these kids 
were so assimilated into
 Ger many t hat they spoke Ger man. 
 Depending on the age too, all th e 
childr en we coul d fi nd e asily.  
This was my job for 
a very, this wa s 1945,
 1946, and there wa s 
plent y of food.  I ha d a uni for m
 of a n A merica n, Under Se cond Cl

These wer e Second Cl

there whe r e we had ver y  good condit ions , we ha d a PX, pri v ileges , cigar ettes, c o ffe e  and so on. 
And everybody was ex

 I started s mo king, I bec a me a ddi cted 
then.  And t h e coffee

said he™ s a presi dent from t he

he says, as I ta lk t o  you, you

 wa s the end of wa ndering for me , I go

A: Okay? 
Q: Let ™s see ,  you™ ve now 
cha nge d your job t o JDC? 
A: Yes .  

Q: Tell  me s o methi ng , w a s J D C on
e of the places that , or gr oup t hat
 were  goi ng int o
 Poland to try 
and find Jewish children wh o 
were or  had been in hidi ng?  
A: Not at that point at 
al l.  Tha t ™s mo dern his t or y.  Joi nt 
Dis t ri buti on Committ ee wa s e stabli she d a s  
part of Onra h ( ph) , t hey wer e a d mini stere d a nd de
pe nde nt on Onrah (ph).  Th
eir job was to identify,  
rehabilitate and help with
 the settlement of all th
e Jewish victims of Nazi
sm.  People were co ming 
out of c onc e ntrati on c a m ps s o they e s tablis he d, a n
d from Pola nd s o me c a me , fr om ot her c ountries . 
The large concentration of Je ws who survived was in
 Ger ma ny.  The others we didn™ t  touc h, that  
was Russia by then.  From all th
e concentration camps, 
fr om all t he death ca
mps i n  Ger ma n y.  In 
Germany there were no death camps, but concentration camps, they 
all came to the bigger cities of 

Germany.  Particularly they gravitated towards th e American occupied zone, which was Frankfor t  

and He idle burg a nd so on.  Some  
we nt to t he Brit ish z one , those 
who were liberat ed fr om Ber gen-
Bel s en .  Ver y fe w wa nte d to be i n
 the Russi an zone a nd ver y fe w wa
nte d to be  in t he Fre nch zone  
even, but some  did.  There were 
concentrati on camps i n t he French 
z one t oo.  Anyway, it  was  a j o b  
of the Joint to fi nd these peop
le, start feeding them
, locat ing their relatives perhaps in other 
countries, help them
 with immigr ation, so they
 took out t he  Je wis h dis plac ed pers ons fr om t he othe r  
camps because there wa
s quite a bit of anti-Semiti
sm in t hese camps.  And 
they brought them into  
their own ca mps, t he y est ablis hed 
Joi n t camps.  You know, t he anti-Semiti sm in t hese camps was an 
intere sting phenome non.  And the y hi red me as a s
econd stat us employee of the Joi nt.  I also had to  
wear a uni form.  I wa s extremely absorbed in this 
work.  It was to me one 
of the great experiences 
of my life , to be able to serve people who su
rvived.  I knew little about 
the concentration camp 
experience, t hey didn™t t alk abou
t it.  My job was mainly to help
 them with immigr ation.  I was 
statione d in Stutt gart , the y brough
t me to Stuffg art.  The Director 
of that office was a Fl ora Levi ne, 
an American woman a
nd I wa s her ass i stant .  And I  recall hundr e
ds of young people 
standing in line

trying to get to me to get a referr
al to t he vi sa depa rt me nt beca use I had t o proces s the m, help t he m.  
I also helped with some of th
e counseling pr obl e ms i f 
they nee ded it .  I  spoke Ger ma n, I spok e  
Yiddis h, I spoke Poli sh, I wa
s ideal fo r this job in this respect.  
It was a job of gr eat sati sfacti on.  I  
couldn™t stop working, I wo rked literally day and ni
ght and everyday I woul
d take these documents 
to t he Ameri can Consul at e in St utt gar t and he wo
uld put a  sta mp a nd he re  was a visa .  One  of the  
jobs  was als o to hel p t h
em reunite with fa m
ili es i n America so they woul
d ge t a f fi da vits.  This i s  
anot her l ong story.  We worke d very closel y wit h
 what wa s Ny-anni-no (ph) a nd t he n was c alled  
Uni t ed Ser vi ce for New Ameri cans, 
and Patri ck wa s dire ctor of it, a 
matter later in another capacity . 
It was extre mel y c o mmi tted a nd de voted wor k, I™ ve 
never wor ked for  an agen
cy in which were such  
commit me nt .  I  found a boy
frie nd there, we wer e s uppos e t o  be
 married, I lat er deci ded I didn™t  
wa nt hi m.  He foll owed me , I mea n, he wa s a n Am
eri can soci al wor ker fr
om Br ooklyn, and we me t 
later in the United States but by 
then I withdrew from 
t he rel ationshi p.  It  was a per i od of extre me  
inve st me nt a nd work a nd hel ping and I™ve  never  be
en in this situation be
fore.  My _______ was  
suppose t o l ead to teachi
ng in the gymnasium level.  So me how or
 ot her, t his was soc i al wor k.  I  
didn™t know it was social wo rk.  So
 I r epresent ed t he Joi nt in di ffer
ent places.  One of the places was 
to go t o the deport ca mp, someti me
s for whatever problems.  I trav
el ed ar ound the displaced persons  
camps i n all  of the American zone
.  I had t o go t o birt hs, I had to go t o a we ddi ng i n the c a mps  
because ther e was treme ndous act ivit y in ter ms of 
marriage, in terms of ha
ving chil dr en.  Nobody 
underst ood at all and ye ars later I 
under stood, it  was part of the 
need for replenish m ent, for not  
being alone , for not facing the ne w world all al on
e, so t hat e ve r yda y the r e wa s a weddi ng, ever yday  
there was a birth and I was a r epr es
entative of the Joint, I was inv
ite d.  Onc e I we nt to a ver y  
meani ngful, extremel y sad occasi
on.  In Bergen-Belsen, I thi
nk a fe w months 
after liberation, 
perhaps a year after  liber ation, t h
e Palestine Agency send
 a monu ment  to be put
 on the gr ounds  of 
Ber gen- Belsen.  Ther e was a reunio
n of all the inmates of
 Bergen-Belse n.  I we
nt  as a r epresent ative  
of the Joint.  This mome nt I™ll 
never forget.  Wh en the Rabbi said
 Ka -dis h (ph) , th
ere came a moan 
fr om the pe ople, nobody cried.  Th
ere  was a moa n , you coul
d hear it on the step
s of Russia .  This 
stays  wi th me, that moan of pe opl
e.  Nobody coul d 
talk, nobody c oul d cr y.  There was, it wa s all i n  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379

that moan of pe ople .  An
other  ti me I  re me mb er th at moa n wa s , 
I j ust hear d two years earlier, when 
in Bremen-hoffin (ph), when I wa s 
taking the boa t to America, we  stayed in Bremen-hoffin (ph) a 
fe w wee ks , waiti ng for t he boat.  
The boat in which I came was the 
Erni e-pile ( ph) , that was then 
name, these are military boats, brok
en military boats.  And again, I wa
s a representative of this, this 
I™ll come to later because it was la
ter.  But anyway, so this wa s the work in the Joint.  Extremel y 
grati f ying.  The y tr eate d  me bea uti fully, the y send 
me once to Par is for a week
 of vacation.
  In those 
days, peopl e di dn™t  travel  to Paris 
on vacati on, I  di d.  They send me
 to Swi t zerland 
once, anyway, it  
wa s all part of the job. 
Q: M aria , you sai d that peopl e di dn™
t talk about their camp experience
s .  Di d you tr y 
to get them to  
talk? 

A: No, no, no, no. 
 My fri ends boyfri end was a  ma n who 
wa s the son of a, wh o came fr om a 
German concentration, it was in Dachau or Buchen
wal d, I ca n™t re me mbe r .  Thi s was in St uttgart  
when I  wor k ed for the Joint.  An

a yed t oget her for a  while .  We 
wer e very cl ose t o eac h other  in 
eve r y wa y.  He  taught  me t o pl ay
 tennis.  But, 
we nev er tal ke d  
about his experiences.  He tol d
 me about his fat her, who was a

___________ i n  
Berli n, Bebo (ph)  was  the na me .  Hi s mot her wa s

had a c aree r  ahe ad of hi m.  I didn™t  
kno w what I  wa nte d to b e .  All I wa n t ed was to work
 for the Joint for the rest
 of my  life.  I me an, 
worki ng wit h people , this
 was like, this was a true sense of
 doing some thing val uable.  Doi ng  
something meaningful after the job as
 a maid .  This  wa s what I wa nte d 
to do for the rest
 of my life, I  
didn™t i ma gi ne I™ ll have a not her l i fe.

 how to ask this questi
on.  In mo st people wh o 
have , including your sel f, 
who have suffe r ed so mu ch a nd l o

s a des p eration to be gin a ne w . 
But there™s also problems in tryi

see, not t rends in pr

certain kinds of things that women, when they ga

childr en?   Even t hough that ma y ha ve be en one  
of t heir de epest desi res , and the r e lationshi ps  
bet wee n me n a nd wome n?  
Q: I think t here was tre me ndous gr oup s upport  whic h hel p ed.  Thes e childre n were  born in t he  

sukkotdow of the chi mneys, literally
 so.  I still don™t u
nderstand what courag
e these women had to 
start fa milies.  I still admire their 
courage.  They foreve
r have been psychoan
alyzed as not loving 
these children because of th
e tr aumati c birt h of these 
c hildr en.  I ha ve s een i t  di ffer entl y, al ways.  I  
think these families, thes
e women sur vive d e motionally onl y be caus e
 of deni al.  Because they didn™ t  
want to think about it, because they didn™t talk a
bout it.  And the power of 
denial can be ver y, ver y  
functi onal a nd a da ptive.  I al wa ys 
te a ch my st ude nts t his , s o we don™
t understand it. 
 Ver y di ffic ul t  
to teach mental health practitioners about it.  I do 
a lot of lecturing on the 
Holocaust and 
this is one 
of the maj or  less ons .  That de nial 
can be a ver y adapti ve mechani s m,
 ver y  helpful and very us e ful . 
In those days, the de nial 
helped.  My own denia l , he
re I had such an i nti mate
 boyfriend.  We didn™t 
talk about his camp 
experiences.  Here I inte
rviewed hundreds, little more 
than hundreds of these 
young me n.  Some of the m ca me  
from, one pla ce  only r ece ntl y disc
overed, from the cit y of Radom.  
I kne w the y  were from t he city of Radom a nd I onl
y disc ove r ed rece ntly th
at the camp in which  
they wor ked was cl ose to Stutt gart, so I got them 
a l l  fro m Ra do m for s o me r
eason.  But I  want ed to 
know what t heir fir st na me , their s
e c ond na me , what they wa nt to do
 in Ameri ca a nd 
all these things 
but we, where, what camp wer e 
the y but the ca mp wa s a na me and not hing else .  The r e was no 
digging into it in any way.  Th
ere wa s a young, beau
tiful woman from the Joint fr om Br ooklyn, 
beautiful!  She was the assistant 
of that man, my  boyfriend, that, 
Omn (ph), the city of Omn (ph). 
And one da y, a  horribl e  thing happe n
ed.  She  st uck her hea d, s he op
ened up the gas stove in her  
apart me nt in Omn ( ph) , s he stuck her hea d in an
d suffocate d.  Nobody unders
tood t he nature of her  
deat h.  I s us pect t hat it was a ver y str ong i de nti fic a
tion wit h the victi ms .  
Rebec c a was her na me, or  
her s econd na me , I don™t re me mber , but s he s h oul d 
be remembered.  But th
ere wasn™t suicides 
there, occasionally you heard a disp
laced person, a Jewish 
displaced person kille
d some German.  It 
wa s all  rar e .   The  mo ve me nt w a s t o

child a hundred names?  These we
re t he big decisi ons a nd the big 
pai n.  You na me d a child whe r e a  
boy c oul d ha ve ha d a  na me  of a  wo
man, of a mother.  Bu
t these young pe
ople, they tended toward 
deni al to an extreme extent.  Some
 of it later in life was dysfunctio

havi ng a  ma rriage .  I ha d t o att e
nd ma ny marri a ges , I  was  a repre sen
tative of the Joint.  Having a 
Rabbi at it, having a little party af
terwards, having a birth, getting vi sa, getting together on that boat. 
My sister  got on the boat , a nd he
r son and her second hu
sband.  She married in
 Krakow™ right aft er 
the war.  He adopted the child and here they go to
gether wit h Mene k to Ameri ca , oka y?   On one of  
the boats .  In the wint er of 1946, I c ertainl y hel p
ed wi th the arrangement s, 
this wa s my job.  And 
here i n Bre me n-hoffi n ( ph) a nd I ge t a fr anti c ca

ened?  He wa s on the 
boat a nd wai ting, you we re fore ver waiting for th
e  boat t o arrive and on t he  boat you were waiting 
for no good reason, you're
 waiting.  These were a
ll military boats, hundred
 of Jewish displaced 
pers ons.  M any Je wi sh people .  
This was the Truman quot a.  We ha d no relatives in America. 
Nobody c ould sent us a n a ffidavit but be ginning 
of 1946, Truman offer e
d a cert ain number of  
affidavits and we were included in it.  That™s how I came to America.  And so did my sister.  What 

happe ned, they calle d out Mene k™s 
name to come to the pursers of
fi ce .  There he was told t hat  
retroactively the Stuttgart 
consul ate notice d i n vi e wing his  x-r ays t hat  he  had t ube rcul osis a nd he ™s  
not  per mi tte d t o e nter  Ameri ca .  The y re moved hi
m from the boat.  Here 
wa s a n orphan, both hi s 
parents were killed.  My 
sister was on her way.  
I ordered my visa to go a 
fe w weeks later.  Well, I  
picked hi m up in Br e me n-hoffe n (
ph), I br ought hi m to s anit arium 
in Ge r ma n.  A horrible t hing, 
sanita rium f or t uber cul ar  conditi on

t I wo uld go home with th
at  pain, what t o do?  
Eventually, I extended my 
visa .  I got  hi m t hrough the Joi nt i nto
 Switzerland, into 
a Joint sanitariu m 
near Lu- gone-au (ph) .  There he got better , he got 
well .  Ame r ican wouldn™t let hi m i n, it ha d to be

wa nt hi m a n d Ameri ca didn™t  want  
him.   Th ere was no money and he
 wa s hungr y often.  We wer e  
in America by then, we would 
send him a little money, very little
, we were making a little money, 
but we s ukkotred.  One  day, he  a dvi
ses us there is a new 
dr ug out, t he y s ay, 
his lung wa s collapsing, 
he had ____________,
 e veryt hing.  Peopl e were  dying, all th
es e ki ds fr om Ausc hwitz.  The y wer e  
teen-a ger s, t hey were dying le ft a nd right .  He kne
w he wa s going to die , but he hear d there was a 
ne w drug cal led stre ptomycin.  Ca n we send it .  1947, s t rept omycin had a tr e mendous pr ice for us . 
We  couldn™t, it was still e
xperimental, whatever
, we couldn™t afford it.  
Somehow or ot
her we made 
it and we se nd it t o hi m.  Thi s bega n his heali ng pro
cess.  The Joint  ha d ide as 
that you have t o trai n 
these young people for jobs t hat 
are available so accordi ng to them
, this was the time that they  
nee ded book binders .  So
 he went t o t he m to bec o me a book 
binder .  Sinc e  then, I™ve al wa ys been 
telling my students that you have to
 do rehabilitation toward
s not what is availabl
e but as part of the 
value syste m  and hi s val u e syst e m, 
a book binder wa s not for hi m.  
In his value syste m  there was a  
profe ssi ona l, to be a bus i ness man, a  profe ssi ona l, 
but  not a  book bi nder.  So he di dn™ t like  book 
binder, they kicked hi m out
, they di dn™t wa nt t o e n
trance hi m.  That was t h
e Joint, but eventually  
they helped him a little bit, very
 little.  The Swiss poli
ce was after him all th
e time, when is he 
leaving the country?  Finally he got a little better, he
 got himself into the Univ
ersity of Brussels, he 
pass ed te sts!   Belie ve it or not , he pa ssed t ests .  He didn™t know t he la nguages but he  had a goo d  

mind for mathematics, for 
chemistry, he was a very
 learned person, but I 
still don™t know.  They 
accepted hi m on a trial  basi s.  
He graduat ed Cum- sa
d-laud, Smugla- c um-l
aud I r e member, i n  
Switzerl and.  Many days he was hungr y ther e.  
The Jewish communit y of
 Swit zerla nd was ver y  
ugl y.  The y didn™t want t o hel p th
ese kids at all.  He had a close 
frie nd who is now a doctor i n, he  
retired, but he was a doct or in New J e rsey.  The y 
had no mone y to live on. 
 They wer e  hungr y.  So 
the Je wi sh c o mmunity i n  Brussel s de cide d, no, he

came out of the 
Holocaust , t hey

, I™ll never forgive them
 for it.  The Swiss Je

they give them this job.
  So, this helps them a 
little bit.  A Jewish woman, a survivor opened a little  
kitchen, a kitchen where she fed, we
 sent a little money to this perso
n.  But anyway, despite all of it,  
he was apparently br
illiant, we didn™t know it 
because he was not a great
 student in gymnasium.  
The  motivati on was how he did s o ver y well .  And ev
er y year  they woul d te ll  hi m he™ s not  rea dy yet  
to go t o America.  Fi nall y, fi nally
 a ft e r many, ma ny years he ca me 
to America.  By then he was 
establ ished i n Switz erla nd.  He had a degr ee, he 
st arted worki n g.  He hate d Ameri c a when he ca me  
but he ma de  it eve ntuall y.  So t his i s  the a ft er m
at h peri od, is really not
 known well and I™ m very  
glad that they™re beginning to teach a little about it. 
 This was a period of ex
treme stress but stres s  
whi ch was pushed down.  Str ess whi ch wa s swal lowe
d.  To r un a w ay, my ow
n trip to the United 
State s wa s Septe mber 24th, 1947. 
 I ca me t o Bre me n-hoffi n ( ph) 
and t he boat  was n™t ready.  The  
boat  ha d not  come  yet .  So what 
do you do on Septe mber 21st, wh
atever it was, in September i n  
Bre me n- hoffin (ph) , ever ythi ng wa
s close d, you coul dn™t buy anyt hi
ng.  I had a lot of Ger man  
marks be cause German marks were very available. 
 S o I  re me mb er , I  wa nte d
 to spend it before 
leavi ng.  So I went t o a beaut y 
parlor and I got a per mane nt .  And 
it took so hard 
wor k, I ca me to  
Ameri ca, I had t o pa y $10 
to remove it.  But 
this is the way, wh
at money meant  in those  da ys .  I got  
on t he boat and the Joint assi gned 
me as an escort to the people 
there, which means I ha d to be 
responsible for the m get t i ng, e ach 
one getting $10, each of the m get
ting a prayer book, in ti me for  
the Holi da ys , eac h of t he m ma king s u re that t hey 
would get kosher 
food.  I had t o be distributing, I  
was the mach-hack (ph).  I was s
till a young woman but I had these j
obs, as a representative of the 
Joint.  I recall sitti
ng on that boat and waiting, fi
nally the boat moved.  The 
anchor was cu
t, this is 
anot her me mo rabl e mo me nt i n my  
life.  Suddenly when the anchor
 was ca ught, it  wa s c ut.  A 
mo ment came from the people on th
at boat, they realized this was,
 what they were leaving behind. 
They were l eavi ng all their famil i
es  burie d t her e.  And i t  wa s n™t 
i mport ant wher e t hey were going, 
but what they were leaving.  This stays with 
me , this mo me nt , th ese mo
ments of separation stay 
wit h me.  These ar e still t h
e most di ffi cult mo ment s in t he li ves of
 survi vor s.  But I recal l disti nctl y  
the moment of Bergen- B eelines, I r e
call the mo ment of the anchor cu

what that  mo ment really
 meant.  Leaving the

people be hi nd.  And going to Ame r ic an in those 
days, they s wore the y woul d never c o me bac k to 
Eur ope.  M a ny, ma ny pe ople  st uck t o
 it, they could never 
go back to Europe.  People  were getti ng 
sick on the boat, it was a fourt een 
da ys ride .  I  wa s the  only one t o
 show in the dining room, there 
wa s marvelous food but there wa s,
 I remember this waitress that, 
ea t more!  Eat more!  There was 
so muc h food.  The  J oint  ga ve eac h 
of us $10, ma ke sure
 to di stribute ever ythi ng.  Ther e was  a gu y

Not  Ma nas c hevit s , who wa s the  ot he

told me that for the rest of my
 life that I™ll be getting chocolat

ver did anyway. 
People were already beginning to 
thi nk, but you know they
 got very sick, they 
were laying sick. 
They could t ake t he seasi de, er, ri

I was sick too.  And 
then sudde nl y ther e is a great , jub
ila nt voi ce all over .  We s e e the St

great mo ments.  It was Saturday
 night and they woul dn™t unl o ad

didn™t work at the dock or whatev

 were all well by then.  People™s  
sicknes s stoppe d since t he voya ge 
st opped.  And that Sta t ue of Li be

world!  Well, I was, my sister
 was there waiting for me, and my 
brother-in-law and 
another friend,  
they took me to the Bronx,
 they had an apart ment .  They wr ote

I thought  it wa s a  pal ati al pl ace .  Ri ght

eventually it worked out.  We we

  It is unbelievable.
  The Swiss Jewish

 a job, I imme diately got 
a job.  I don™t know how 
i mme diat ely I got t he job.  The J o

 By the way, later on 
I suddenly get a check of a lot 
of money, $1300, i n  1947, 
$1300 wa s a fa ntas tic

them for years.  She still 
fe els it, she has been treated extremely 
well.  They send me no job, the y  
send me t o t he Kni ght s of Je wi sh Appe al as a

rribl y dull work.  But I  
re me mb er th e da y 
when a telegram was 
se nt t o ever y e mployee , that the y rea che d t h eir quota  of  
$250 million dollars, in 1
947, signed by Morgan-t

 (ph) was the chief of 
the UJA then.  And here it 
said that the exec utive director was 
He nr y M ontor ( ph) , I don™t know i f  
you know t h e na me , it  was a big na me in t hose da ys
.  Yo u deal with forty, 
sixty br o-ter (ph) , He nry  
Mont or( ph) wa s in char ge of t he UJ A.  One day, he
 has a fall out wit h his , wit h Mor gan-tow (ph) s o 
they had to s eparat e.  So Morgan-t ow (ph) re mains 
as the direc t or of the UJ A and Mont or (ph) goes  
to anot her or gani zation c alled t he Pa

long time, about the 
wat erways in Palesti ne.  The Direct or 
of Pe rsonnel at the UJ A, Montor (ph)  
took her wit h hi m, t o t h e ot her orga nizati on.  And 
she  took me .  So I ended 
up there.  It was in a 
hotel  whic h doe sn™t  exi st  anymor e ac ross  the  Wal dol
f Astoria, it was a fi ne 
job, the rooms were air  
conditioned.  They made me
 t he ar chi vist there.  For some reas
on I li ke it because I was very qui ck  
in getting the files they n

had, I lived already in the city b y  
there, until one day I get this 
call from the United Service for 
New Americans, which is known 
NYANA, New York Association for 
New Americans.  Th
ey™ve always been 
in the business of 
helpi ng re fugees .  And t hey sa y, whe n I fir st ca me 
to Ame r ica  I ha d one vi s
it with them, 
asking for  
work, and t h ey sai d, wha t  I want to do?   So I said
, what I want to do was wh
at I did fo r the Joint in 
Ger ma n y.  The y s ay, oh no, t his i s  soci al wor k
, for this  you ne ed a de gree .  The y wer e st upi d 
beca use I ha d language s and a ll the se displ ace d pe rs

 to give up the

six days, for five days.  Every da

me to Dr. Serrett 
(ph), who was a  
very fa mous  psyc hiatris t  for the Nat i onal School
s of Soc i al Work.  I di
dn™t know a  thing about  
social  wor k.  And he i nte rvie we d 
me , he wa nted to know
 my c hildhood an
d everyt hing.  J ust t o put  
it on record.  They were so lim

childhood, my relati on wit h
 my mother, my relation with my fath

 my sibl ings.  
Thi s took hours  and 
hours, everyday an int erv
i e w.  The fi nal one  wi t h 
Dr. Se rret t  (ph)  and he 
apparent ly a ppr ove d so I got in.  But to the s u kko
tme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody 
aske d about the Holoc aust.  It wa
s a  non-s ubj ect  in t hose da ys.  
This wa s 1949, 1950.  Well, for  
some r eas on he c hos e me and I go
t i n and I was very un
ha ppy.  I didn™t under sta nd what thi s st udy 
wa s all a bout.  He us uall y ca me fr om the st udy of
 sociology, psychology, 
I was student of Polish 
literature.  They talked language 
which I didn™t understand and I 
fi gured, how can 
I withdraw, how 
will I get my old job back?  It wa
s very painful to me until the seco

 began to go 
extremely well, let™s put it this wa
y.  Not hi ng hel ps like a litt l e success and a teacher j ust read my 
paper, whi ch I thought was nothi n
g, they all thought was excellent
.  Anywa y, it was gre at and I wa s  
graded ve ry well .  So thi s is ho
w I got into the profession.  I ha
d no mo ney.  I lived in a, it was 
amazing, wi th a Jewish fami ly i

x dollars  a week, I r e me mbe r .  I  
didn™t ha ve enough money to li ve.  My sc hol ar

me $25 a week, wh
ich would have lasted e xce pt  
that my fiel d wor k i n social  wor k
, t hree  da ys  a wee k you have to be
 in the field.  And this idiot 
arran ged my  fiel d wor k t o be Ne w

 was in Adel-fy 
(ph) s o $20 or whate ver , $18 of th
at mone y went  for tr avel .  Whe n
 I wa s  finally s ele cted by the  
committee to enter the school, the 
dean congratulated
 me and he asked me wh
ether I want to study  
case work, a nd I didn™t know
 wh at ca se wor k was , so I say , what
 does social work have to do with 
cheese?  Because case in
 German means chee
se!  He started laughing a
nd was still la

left, thi s was my preparat ion for soci al wor k, but 
I  ma de it.  And I di d we ll .  My sec ond place me nt,

there.  I  lived there, and ever y psychi atric cond
iti on I  i m medi ately absor b ed
 as my  own.  So one 
wee k I was s c hiz op hren i c , the next we ek I was ma ni
c de pre ssi ve.  It was ver y har d on me but it wa s 
the second year and I  hadn™t done
 ver y well , s o I graduate d a n yway
.  Since then I™ve had good jobs 
and been a social wor ker  since th
e n.  I retired.  I actuall y wor ked
 for Was hington, for the Fe der al  
Gover n me nt, I wor ke d for ni ne ye ar s for the Na ti
onal I nstit ute of Me ntal  Healt h.  These we re 
special projects and drug
 addition.  And I was a 
supervisor in a big agen
cy then and I use to 
commut e a n d c o me t o Wa shi ngt on and the y we re 
ver y l arge with mone y. 
 This was the end of 
1950™s, early 1960™s.  Johnson™
s progra ms spent a lot of mone
y for rehabilitation, for human 
servi ces .  They insiste d I should travel firs t cl
ass  because I had a high ra nk, GS-12 in thos e days  
wer e the high rank.  It was not be comi ng for a person
 with this GS grade to, 
not to go in important  
wa ys .  Anywa y, there was a lot of st upi d mone y spe
ndi ng.  We didn™t re habili tate too many pe opl e I 
can tell you, but it was a n easy j ob a nd pre stigi o us job.  The y sent me to be traine d at Lexi ngt on, 

Ke ntucky where  the y ha d the United Sta t es  Publi c H

Our job was  to visit eve r y agen
c y a nd hos pital i n Ne w Yor k Cit y, open up the doors for dr ug  

addi cts.  We did it , it wa s a whol
e new thing.  A ne w ball ga me for 
me t otall y, but we  ac compli she d  
a lot in this respect, not
 that drug addicts were 
not rehabilitated easily but I 
have been involved in it  
for ma ny ye ars.  And the n one day,
 again, I was re-married in 196
2 and my husband was a teacher. 
He  ha d l ong va cations , he wanted hi
s  wi fe t o go on vacati ons but  
I onl y ha d four  wee k s.  One  day 
we ca me ba ck from a summer vacat i on, t here™ s a  lette
r fr om t he the n De a n of the School of Soci al  
Wo rk at Tall -a-dot (ph) who reme
mbered me because he was my rese
arch professor at Ad el-fy (ph) . 
It wa s a ne w school then, he as ked t h at I join t h
e facult y it was  that ea sy.  In the se da ys , you woul d 
have to ha ve  all kinds of quali ficati ons.  Wha t  ha
ppened, somewhere or other,
 for many years after I 
graduate d, they use d t hat paper fo

very ha rd at Hunter  from the  first .
  I  didn™t wa nt t o gi ve  up my 
job as an AMH but 
they were very 
generous wit h me so the y per mitt ed
 me to work half time only for 
fi ve ye ars.  T he fi rs t  fi v e  year s 
were full time, and then f
our years lat er, hal f ti me for Wa shi

nice.  I belong to the Federal E m
pl oye es Retir e ment 
Se ction, or  what
e ver it  i s.  So, I™ve c onnecti ons  
to Washington no doubt!  
I™ve been at  Hunter fr om 
1962, fi rst fi ve ye ars wer e  
hal f ti me .  And I went  
there, I retired in 1970, my ma
rria ge  dissol ve d in 1970, we s epara
t ed for the ne w di vorce and in 
1974 he di e d.  He was youn
ger than I, he go
t le uke mia and he die d.  An
d I retired from Hunter in 
1989, but I still teach t he Hol ocaust 
course so I remai n very much 
i n, connected t o the Hol ocaust  
course.  I started it on my  sabba
tical year because I wa
s e motionall y more r ea dy t o c onfr ont  t hat  
material.  Until then, it wa
s always with me, but I 
couldn™t quite read.  I 
started digging into it and 
since  then I cannot  lea ve it, no
w and forever i nvol ved in it. 
Q: What year was that? 
A: This was, my sa bbatic al was 
1978 and I start ed teachi ng i n 1979 
a nd I ha ve been teaching it still 
since .  It™s  a l wa ys bee n an i mport ant  part  of my
 life and since then I have
 been lecturing all over 
beca use it™ s the onl y sc hool of soc i al i n the countr y 
which offers it, which is 
unusual.  Yes, whic h i s  
very unique, so 
I™m still with it. 
Q: We re you unhappy 
t o l eave t he case work t hat you wer e do
ing and go into teac
hi ng?   Did you do  
it be cause  your hus ba nd wa
nte d you t o do it?  
A: By t he n I  wa s not doi ng a ny, I di dn™t c are , I wa
s a s upe r visor .  I had a big j ob, I  published, I  
wr ote some t hing on dr ug additi on and I didn™t want to
 leave because it was a very well paying job at  
that point and it was a prestigious 
job.  My hus ba nd wa nted me to bu
t this was not th
e major thing. 
I was not a little woman ever in my 
life.  I think my parents sort of 
made me fe el I™
m okay and this 
really hel pe d  I thi nk.  I™ve ne ver  succ umbe d t his 
wa y, but my  husba nd wa nt
ed it.  Wh at was ver y  
nice was t he prospect of long vacat
i o ns.  We al ways t raveled for 
ten year s which was great .  But, 
no, there was al ways 
somet hing i n t eachi ng that 
was pr esti gi ous.  I di dn™t  
think t hey would take me 
but they did and ther
e were lots of time
s there too, all kinds 
of politics in the Univ
ersity so I don™t 
nee d to t ell you a bout it , very ofte n t h ey wa nt me 
out .  Eve ntually I ma de my
 way i n a nd e ve ntua l l y  
I did well, but I had r ough year s ther e  too.  The wo
rk was over whel mingly big,
 a lot of work.  And 
there™ s so much c o mpe tit ion the r e.  I f you wer e 
on good ter ms wit h one , the  other one was angry to  
you.  Not because of me but
 because of perhaps they
 didn™t like the other pe
rson because politics of

the University are so meth
ing to write books about.
  But basically, it™s a de
cent school, it was a 
dece nt sc hool and of all t he jobs I ha d there a d
mis sions wor k, you know, y
ou do everyt hing.  I ha d 
facult y advi sement . 
 The favorite t h ing for 
me was al ways teachi ng. 
 I liked accompanying th e 
student s and this saved me al ways, always .  The r e 
were rough years too.  
When I reti red t hey did  
something awfully nice for me.  Th
ey established a collection of Ho
locaust literature 
in my name. 
And it™s ther e whi ch is , a nd I want
ed it in the name, I had a conflic
t of whi ch na me it s hould go, I  
wa nte d my pare nts too and I wa
nte d my husba nd too.  So fir s
t we had it Maria Herr Schneider 
Rosenbl oom, the y sai d, but what be ca me Mar i a  
Herr Rose nbloom.  And occ asi onal l y I lect ure d  
fr om it, books I bought, that is cont inuous s ort 
of input whi ch is gre at, coul dn™t be better .  My 
parents will be reme
mbered this way, my fa mi
ly will be remembered th
is way, it™s marvelous I 
think.  But since then I™
ve always been 
in private practice a little bit. 
 But always Ho
locaust related. 
Q: Pri vate pr actice? 

A: Ye s.   Al wa ys Holo ca ust r e late d,  a l wa ys .  Th e fi
rst ti me I work wit h Hol o
ca ust sur vi vors  was  in a 
psychiat ric, I was  wor ki ng in ps yc hi atry bec ause  
it was a nat ural t hi ng for 
me.  I was trained in a 
wa y, s o my fir st job wa s  the ps ychi at ric clinic of 
the Bathesda Hospital.  And there I was the only  
Yiddis h s pea king per son, none of t h
e psychiat rists spoke Yiddis h, or wa
nte d to speak Yi ddish.  So I  
wa s very much invol ve d 
with ever y patient, nearly every pa
tie nt.  M a ny of the se people  were  
considered r efugees fr om Eur ope. 
 These were all concentration ca
mp s u rvivors .  Nobody kne w t he 
ter m.  I r e me mb er ma n y, ma
ny fa ntast i c sit uati ons  
fr om t here .  One ma n r e fuse d s hock t r eat me nt s o  
they sent hi m to see me, see Miss
 Schneider .  Because I speak th
e same.  And in 
my stupi dity I  
thought, why not?   He says hi s mo
ther-in-la w di s appr oves, I s aid, I™ll 
tal k to your mot her-i n-la w.  
And hi s boss , he doe sn™t wa nt hi s bos s to know, s o 
I sa y, oka y, I ca n talk t o  hi m too.  I e xha ust al l of  
the possibilities and he says
 to me, to tell me the tr
uth.  I don™t want to ma
ke con-a-des-ot-rich (ph),  
shocki ng, no, ele ctric s hoc k treat
ment of me .  Some of t hese sc
e nes  were unbel i eva ble.  One  
woman, this I™ll never fo
r get.  She shoul d be  re me mbere d s o me
where as a result.  One woman, an  
__________ from the Lower 
East Side, I didn™t know her bac
kgr ound ve r y much, but she tol d me  
that she needed an apart ment.  Th
ey wer e in a horrible wal k up an
d they so needed to, it was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
93 
 
difficult, it was after the war, apar
t m ents were not available.  So 
I did e ve r ythi ng poss i ble to move  
this family.  Finally, on Grant St
ree t  on t he Lower Ea st Side , pr
oject s ca me up.  Lower inc o me  
proje cts a nd I got a n apar t me nt for the m i n a ne w 
buil ding.  Wit h ele vat ors,
 with ever ythi ng.  The  
day the y mo ve, to move, she  runs 
i n to the cli nic desperate, i nsi
sti ng she must s
ee me .  Crying, 
fal ling down on t he fl oor.  I™ve ne
ver seen such, what happened?  
She cannot live th
ere, she moved  
in and she, I  have t o bei ng her 
back to the ol d pl ace. 
 She cannot live t here 
and I don™t under stand 
what was going on.  This goes on for a while, th
at she cri es, I must do somet hing for her, she  
doesn™t want  to live t her e anymore.
  She didn™t say commit suicide,
 but she doe sn™t wa nt to li ve  
anymore.  Finally, I still didn™t u
nderstand, fi nally she sa
ys, the incinerators.  
I, that wa
s a moment 
of a wa keni n g for me .  I didn™t kn
ow about thi s re vulsi on, nobody talk
ed a bout the se things i n thos e  
days.  She c oul d not li ve  with t he re mi nder of Ausc
hwitz.  She couldn™t l i ve 
with the incinerators. 
So, thi s was a poi nt of le arning 
for me.  The n I st arted t aki ng hist
ories whi ch included the hi stor y,  
until then, he was born 
i n Chop- kov (ph) a nd Pola
nd and he went  through 
t he  war,  he wa s i n a  
ca mp, he  wa s in a war c a mp.  That 
wa s the level of knowle
dge.  But si nc e the n, I™ ve got a lot of 
experience.  For four yea r s I wor ke d i n ps ychi atric  
clinic.  Gave me a lot of
 experi ence in worki ng 
with survivors.  One woma n left her child in the 
hospit al, she di dn™t  want th
e  chil d.  I went  on a  
home visit , she a nd her  hus ba nd 
t h ought , she deliver ed t her e, th
ey didn™t wa nt 
the child.  Wh o 
would de fe nd suc h a thi ng?   And then I hear d th
em speak.  She was in a 
camp and she saw some 
horrible fate of children. 
 And he was so identified
 with her that he literall
y repeated all her words 
and all her ideas, he ass u me d all her i deati ons .  In t
hos e da ys we had a ter m for it, a- folly-adert ( ph) , 
he thought exactly like his wi fe.  
So these were things 
none of the doctors u
nder stood any of it  
beca use it was a non-subject.  The Holoc aust wa s a 
non-subje ct truly until Ish- met z (ph) story ca me  
through.  I wa s ver y luc ky to ha ve
 t his experi ence and I al ways st ay
ed with it in a way.  I started 
attending meetings.  Ther
e wa s so me , wh at was h i s  na me?   A p s yc
hi atrist , Christal ( ph) a nd Frei del-
lander (ph) , t hey be gan to talk a b
out it.  And then
 when I  est ablis
he d a cour se I b
eca me  very  muc h  
devote d.  But I™ve always  had patie nts  of thi s bac k gr
ound, ver y  fe w, but al wa ys to se e some pe ople  

with this kind of background.  
I still see one, what do you call it? Load-man-ish (ph), doesn™t really

matt er reall y , you know, but I™ve al ways
 kept a fo ot in the door with th
is so I™ve been always into it. 
It hel ps  in my te achi ng.  I ne ed to bri ng t he  pa st
 e xperi enc e, _____________ 
t he survi vor  agenci es. 
I neve r le ft t he Hol oca us t. 
 It™s str ange, but some how or ot her , it 
became a central part
 of my life .  I 
am sure t he central part 
of eve r y s ur vivor™s li fe , but I™ m mor e
 aware of i t.  You never leave t he 
Hol oc aust behind rea lly.  Those you see or thos
e you don™t see.  Thos e 
who tal k a n d those who 
don™t talk.  It is the same coin, it™
s just the reverse side.  But if th
ey don™t  want t o talk or whethe r  
they talk obsessently about it, it™s 
the sa me.  You don™t e xor cis e it, 
it is with you. 
 S o me re me mb er ,  
some don™t wa nt to r e me mber .  Y
ou don™t want to re me mber  beca use 
it ™s  so ce ntral t o your li fe. 
The pai n is s o str ong.  Someti mes 
people don™t stop talkin
g about it .  Wit h me an
d with all of us it  
has been a central, we are very aw
are of the centrality of
 this experience in ou
r lives.  The question  
always arise s how i s it possi ble , 
you know, but you c an buil d on t he 
trauma.  I always think of the 
Mexic an citi es, t he Maya ns, who tal k
 about t hese t hings.  You can buil d
 on ruins, t hat  be my poi nt. 
Yo u never resolve it, you don™t wo
rk it through.  I teac
h my st ude nts t his wa y, it™ s ne w te achi ng t o 
ma ny of us, but t hey wi ll  learn it
.  You don™t work thro
ugh thi s  kind of a tr
a u ma.  You don™t c o me  
to terms with it ever, I think.  Bu
t you work on top of it and you try t o
 buil d some me a ningful li ves .  
And t his i s r eally what™s  i mport ant , this hel ps 
you I think.  Alt
hough I™ve s een ma
ny pe ople ha ve  
done ver y, very, obtained 
riches and I don™ t consider their lives
 very me ani ngful but they ke pt  
goi ng.  It™s really buil ding on t op of t he trauma , 
li ke buildi ng on top of a r u
in.  Starti ng up, what  
you're  doing is there .  It does n™t ha ve 
to destroy your life, 
that™s my point. 
Q: So t he meani ng t hat you build i s a l wa ys a bove  wh
at ha ppe ned?   It™s not that you i nt egrate d thi s 
me ani ng?  
A: I don™t t h ink your full y int egra t
ed wit h the Hol ocaust ever .  But 
I do t hi nk t hat t o ha ve, to give  
some mea ni ng to it .  To what eve r
 you do, li ke our lecturing, peop
le c o me  to see you, you have to 
give t esti mo ny.  We all find some me aning in doi ng somet hing so t he 
people will not be for got ten.  
This helps us.  Now, I never feel 
that this is beneficial
 emotionally because su
rvivors refuse  to get 
any e motional be ne fit s  fro m t he t r age dy.  But 
to fin d so me mea ni ng 
in it, either through 
re me mbering, t hrough t e sti monies , 
t h rough wri ting, t hroug

supporting the Museum
.   All of these thin
gs give  some  me ani ng and t hey
 help in going on, I think  
so.  It™s mainly helping in 
transmitting something to
 the new generations. 
 But there are many 
victi ms of the Hol ocaust.  People 
c ould never  real ly sta rt li ving a gain.  Some  ha ve ended up i n t h e  
State hospit als.  I gi ve lectures ther e, at Manha
ttan State Hospital, Lochin 
State Hospi tal, some of  
the doctors told me that they ha
ve casualties of the Holocaust for 
forty years, they came.  Nobody 
underst ood i t  there.  Thei r trag
edie s, nobody unde rstood t he m or
 s o mehow or other  nobody hel ped  
them and they may be there or 
may be dead but, ma ny people have
 nightmares.  My sister still 
suffer s fr om ni ght ma res .   I  ha ve  enough of re pre ssi
ve potential in 
me  that  I don™t 
suffer from t hat  
but ma ny peopl e ha ve night mare s, ma ny peopl e  have
 s u ffe r ed continuous migra i ne  heada che s ,  
ma ny pe opl e ha ve e xtr e me fear s, ma ny ha ve  ma
ny phobias .  Ma ny, ma ny ga stro-i ntesti na l  
sympt o ms fr om eati ng gl ass which was put int o 
bread i n Ber g en- Belsen.  There ar e many, many 
physical  a nd ps ychologic al mani fest at
ions but, by and large, while we
 have a lar ge number of t hese  
people that are still alive, we 
have ma ny more, we
 have many more who have
 done well.  Wh o use 
this experience in more pos
it ive  ways, partic ularl y the s econd ge
nerati on are very i mpressi ve t hi s  
wa y.  The y t r y to gi ve s o me  mea n
ing to their parental experiences. 
 I te ach along t hese  l i nes , whi ch 
me ans I don™t deny the t r age dy a nd I  don™t bely so
me of t he  cons equenc es of ps yc ho-pathology  
nature, but I think that the 
positives of it, the strength
 of survivors, is quite im
pres sive .  Eve n i f they 
have conflicts of all kinds.  Many
 have literally risen fr om ashes, 
let™s fa ce it.  And have formed 
good fa milies.  In some fa
milies, the Holocaust has le
d to a lot of conflict, 
has lead to prejudices, 
has lead to exclusion.  But by an
d la rge, sur vivor s ha ve had t o pa
ve t he wa y.  Ta ke a look at t he  
Armenians.  They didn™t have
 an Arme nian Genocid
e Museum until the su
rvivors built one in 
Wa shi ngt on, or whate ver .  We are taught a lot of 
peopl e ha ve s u ffere d mas s i ve tra gedi e s  to fi nd t he  
meani ng i n the tragedy.  I 
think that Holocaust survivors have tr
uly lea d the wa y to it .  You and I ,  
we  are starting so  mu ch mo re. 
Q: Le t me a sk you one que stion he
r e.  Given what ha ppe ne d aft er th
e Holocaust.  If I just name, 
Ca mbodia or Bosnia, or Rwa nda , 
Tibet.  Wh at, is there a conflic
t in you about th
e wor l d you ma y  
have lear ne d, maybe i t  wa s a le ss on you never  ha
d t o le arn, about how wr ong thi s i s, but , there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379  
96 
 
seems to be something in the worl
d that repeats .  And now the worl d ha s learne d how to do thi s . 
And it ha sn™ t  said, we won™t do it.  Only cert ain pe
opl e ha ve s aid it, we won™t do it .  Is there a ki nd  
of conflict in you about, wh at me
ani ng can you create after t he Hol o
ca us t if s uc h thi n gs ca n ke ep 
repeat ing? 
A: I™ m not s ure I know, de fini tely
, I do not know.  Howe ver , in my
 cours e, I i nte grate  the le ss ons , 
like some of the experiences
 in Rwanda.  The newest, at earlier ti
mes when I first st
arte d teachi ng, it  
wa s Ca mbodia.  Act ually, ev
er y one of t hese event s triggers off 
the st ude nts  que stions a bout it, s o I  
wa nt student s to look at i t , that it cont inue s.  What  will ever st op it I de fini tely do not know.  I do  

not think it is a psychological 
thing, I think that it™s in politics,
 in economics, in geographic 
dislocati ons , there  are ma ny,
 ma ny thi ngs  tha t  br ings 
it to that eruption.  I 
think that Yugoslavia wa s 
some what of a different kind of ba
ll  ga me.  I don™t  compare  wit h it 
with Rwanda or with Ca mbodia. 
I ha ve  on my bookc ase  here  a bo
ok fr om a girl who sur vive d Ca
mbodia.  She has a Polish na me, 
She - man-ski  (ph)  a nd she™s of Poli s h parent age I 
think.  You know the na
me?  It™s called, The 
Stones Cr y Out .  And it  
is as tragic as the Holocaust.  And Rwanda  certainly is, we™re just so fa r 
re moved.  The less on we  have n™t lear ned is t o be id
entified, is to fe el with
 them.  Important as you 
are, I t hi nk affect is i mportant, to feel is ver y 
i mportant.  This , I don™t kn
ow very well, how we ca n 
transmit it.  That it appears in th
e Ne w Yor k Ti mes, a very fe w in t h
is , and the n it dis a ppe ars.  So me 
of the se thi ngs s houl d be hel d for e ver in t he 
c ountry for the pe opl e.  
We shoul d never for get  
Rwanda.  Whom do I know th
at really knows about it? 
Q: One smal l question, at the end. 
 For e xa mpl e, you mentioned a l a
st na me  of yours ,  it appear s, 
Schnei der .  I s that Sc hne i der?  

A: Neider, my husba nd™s na me . 
 Never Schnei der!  Hi s pa rents na me has the Ger ma n spelling

 was a very big attic 
whi c h was t he maga- zel n (ph) wher e  they ke pt all
