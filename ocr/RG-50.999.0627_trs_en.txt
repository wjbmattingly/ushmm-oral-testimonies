>> Bill Benson: Thankyou so muchfor joining us, Fred andfor your wil lingness to be our 
Fi r s t  

Persontoday. W e're thrilled tohave you with us.  You have somuch to shareand we have 

such a shortperiod of  tim e, we should start right away.
 
You were born in Decem ber1932, just weeks before Hitler becam eChancellorof  Germ any in 

 
3
 
1933. Bef ore you tell us what happened to you under the Nazis andduringW orldW ar II and 
the Holocaust, tell us about your fam ily and their lif ebefore Hitler cameto power. W hat was 

t h e ir lif e  lik e ?
 
>> Fred Kahn: My m other was born inApril 1906.  She attended af ini
shing school on the 
border with Switzer land.  Andm y father was sent to oneday take her hom eand two years 

af ter that, m yf athermarried m y mother when she was 18 years old,andhe was 28 years old.
 
T his was now 1924. And at that tim e, Germ any had a dem ocratic governm ent.  Between1924 

until I was born,m y m other andf ather hadaver y comf ortable lif e. My f ather was a 

businessm an, and unfortunately, his f ather
-
in
-
law died of  kidney cancer two m onthsaf ter they 
had m arried.
 
So that'sabout it.
 
>> B ill B e n
son: Yourf ather had served in theGerm an arm y inW orldW ar I, right?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.  My f ather, hisown father, actually died when he was only 14 years 

old.  He was born in1896. But duringW orldW ar I, m yf ather volunteered with the Germ an 

A r m y.
  
He got wounded.  He was a m achinegunner and got wounded in France.  He was 
awarded one of the highest m edals at that time of the Germ an Arm y by thef uturepresidentof  

Germ any.  Marshal Hindenburg.
 
>> One last questionbef ore we move on. How lar ge was 
your extended fam ily?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Quite abit.  Because our own im mediatefam ily, I had only, af term y older sister 

died when she was only aboutaf ew m onthsold.  AndI hada lotof  
--
 
it was t wo of us withour 
parents.
 
>> Bill Benson: You had an olderbrother?  Hans?
 
>> Fred Kahn: He was f ive years older.
 
>> Bill Benson: And did you have a large extendedfam ily?
 

>> Fred Kahn: Maiden name ofm y m other was Greenbaum .  My gra ndmother was going to 

stay with usf ora long tim e was am aidennam e, Barnes.  On theKahn side, Jacob Kahnwas 

m y grandfather born in 1855 ina sm all village  in Germ any.
 
W hile I was on the Internet years ago, I corresponded with som ebody f rom  there who 

happened to live next door to where m y grandf ather hadbeen born.  Andf ound his grave.  And 

I ' m  s t ill in  co n ta c t  wit h  h im .
 
>> Bill Benson: It wasn't long af ter Hitler came topower in early 1933 that yourf atherdecided 

to leave Germ any f orBelgium. W hatdo you know about yourf ather's decision to leave that 

early, and why he went without the restof  thefam ily?
 

>> Fred Kahn: My f ather was never invol ved in politics,but kept upwith the news.  And he 

thought that Hitler would not lastm ore thanacouple of  years. That's wh y also at thetim e,a 

private arm y of  Hitler, the Nazis was attacking Jews and som e killing them  in W iesbaden.
 
AndApril 1,1933. Probably heard about that.  So in Septem ber,m y father went tounder the 

guise 
--
 
you had to sign up.  My m other did that.  He went toBelgium  hoping that Hitler actually 
would be gone by thetim e he would com e back.
 
And that didnot happen.  And som y m otherandm y brother andmy grandmother joinedm y 

father in Belgium .
 
>> Bill Benson: And your m other wentf irstand then your grandm other went with your brother.  

Anda lit later 
--
 

>> F r e d  K
ahn:T wo buildings they owned andshe hadto sell itf irst.
 
>> Bill Benson: By the tim e yourm other andgrandm otherand brother had left, you were lef t 

with your aunt and uncle?
 

 
4
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson: Tell us, and you would stay wi th them until 1938.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: Tell uswhat thattim e asbestyou know, I know you were very young. W hat 
was that time likefor you living with your aunt and uncle?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Very, very lo ving.  All I rem ember is a lot of hugs.  Really truly lo ved m e.
 
Anda boy m y age, wh o was not Jewish,W alter. W alter was so close tom e that oneday other 

kids said were children 
--
 
Germ an soldiersthat had been stationed in thetown where I lived 
there, rightaf term e and threw stones afterme and cal
led m e dirty J ew.
 
W ent through the alley and asked him  inGerm an, the only language I knew.  [Speaking 

Germ an] I said what was a Jew.  I didn't know that. T om e, I was probably only 4, 5 years old.  

T ha t's it.
 

Andof  course sometimes of  course, I was naug
h t y.
 
[Laughter]
 
I slept with adog in a hut, andthey were looking all over town f orm e and eventually f oundm e 

sleeping there with a dog in a doghouse.
 
[Laughter]
 
And yeah, right.  Oneday I was ver y inquisiti ve.  I was up in theattic and I looked throug
h .  I  
was clim bing up to see how you would see the placef rom  there. Fortunately, m y aunt was 

right behind me and grabbedm e.  Of  course I got spanked.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if  youhad any contact with your m other andfather during that 

t
im e with your aunt and uncle?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Occasionally m y m other whowas in Belgium  wouldcom e.  People did notfear 

at the tim e. In 1933 to1938 som ething would happen to wom enor children.  They knew that 

m en would be most likely interned. But m y mother wouldoccasionally com e.
 
I didnot know that she was m y m other.  I remem ber thinking who's that woman? Is she your 

f riend? She hadblack hair.  And so she huggedm e. I rem em ber the hug.
 
>> Bill Benson: Asfar as you were concerned.  Your aunt and uncle were like your parents?
 

>> Fred Kahn:T hat's right.  Absolutely.  Idon't remember what I called my uncle,butI called 

m y aunt Mama. Evenwhen later on I was taken to Belgium.  I yelled and cried Mam aand a lot 

of  tears.  I consideredher my mother.
 
>> Bill Benson: During that tim e with your aunt and uncle, I believe they lost their business.  It 

was taken away f rom  them?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right.  In 1935, they were selli ng m eat and sausages, and it was closed.
 
>> Bill Benson: The Nazis closed it?
 
>> F r e d
 
Kahn: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: You also shared with m e that while you were there,your paternal grandmother 

died.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes.  Around 12:00 each day, there were two brothers who m arried two sisters 

who li ved notfarf rom  each other.  My grandm other, onm y paternal side was theolder sister of  

m y aunt. W hich was also m y aunt.
 
And I would take m y grandm other, walk herf rom one of the sisters to the other sisters.  And in 

fact, whenboth sisterswere quarreling with each other 
--
 
[Laughter]
 
June 1, 1938
, unf ortunately, shedied.
 

 
5
 
>> Bill Benson: And you were with her?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes.  Right.  And shef elldown and she died.  But I rem em ber where she was 

buried. Because the year af ter, around that tim e, the Nazis f orbid Jews to have a gravestone.
 
>> B i
ll Benson: So your grandm other hadnotom bstone?
 
>> Fred Kahn: But I rem em ber where she was buried.
 
>> Bill Benson: During that tim e what were yo ur parents doing in Belgium?
 
>> Fred Kahn: My f ather became 
--
 
he was abusinessm an.  He hadto start all over again.  
But then he became abridge player.  And asa result,he got to know a lot of peoplef rom  the 

bridge establishment.
 
And that would be very 
--
 
I tell m y wif e, this is eventually when we went intohiding, this was 
thanks tothe bridge connection.
 
Be c
ause they consideredm y f ather.
 
>> Bill Benson: Afellow bridge player.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: Your move to join your parents in 1938, in Octoberof 1938, was sudden. Tell 

us what precipitated you going to Belgium  and what was invol ved in getting you there.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Mostof you probably know about the Munichpactthat gave away part of 

Czechoslovakia to the Nazis.  Next day m y f ather called sister, saidget the boy out of  

Germ any.  My f ather thought they would close theborder and eventually there would be war.  

Inf act he was right.  11 months later we wer e out in Europe.
 
So bef ore I was taken to the city of  Aachen and turnedover to a lady.  There was a guard next 

to our house.
 
Andduring the night, they for som e 
--
 
I never could unders
tand it, but I was with them  where 
they buriedthe religious relics of  the synagogue inthe landf ill.
 
>> Bill Benson: You were with them .
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.  Trying tof igure out the reason why they wantedm e there. T he next 

m orningm y uncle took m e and as we walkedoutof  the courtyard I was turning over tom y 

f riends, I wantedto say good
-
bye.  T hat's the last thing that m y uncle wantedto let people 
know that I'm  leaving.
 
So he said he'salready in thef ield.  And so he took me by traintoacity pr
ovince, W iesbaden, 
which is near Frankfurt.  To thetown of  Aachen.
 
>> Bill Benson: Beforeyou tell us about that. W hen you were toldthat you're going to leave, 

did you realize that you were now going to move away f rom  your aunt anduncle and go to 

your parents?
 
>> Fred Kahn:T hey just toldm e I was going to take abig trip.  Didn't go intoany details.
 
>> Bill Benson: The landfill where the religious relics were buried.
 
>> Fred Kahn:T he landf ill was just up the street.
 
>> Bill Benson: And in fact, that synagogue was burned shortly later.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Six weeks later.  Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson: Now you're taken toAachen.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. And there af riendof  another uncle lived by there in Belgium .  By the 

name of Harlem  Kahn.  There was a lady there, and somehow m y father decided to get meout 

of  Germ any.  He musthave had a lot of phone calls.  Andobviously his brother told him  he 

knows a person there in Aachen, a Christian lady.  My uncle took me toher. Never knew her 

bef ore.  Do youunderstand?  So that's whathappened.
 
>> Bill Benson: So she just was wil ling to take you across the border?
 

 
6
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.  Because she was the f riendof  another uncle.  She tookm eby 
streetcar to theborder with Germ any and then in Germ any, of  course, germ theonly language 

and knew 
--
 
Germ an, the only language I knew then.
 
>> Bill Benson: Sonom an's land. Like a space.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Like one blockbetweenGermany, theborder and Belgium .
 
>> Bill Benson: So she told you this little boy 
--
 

>> Fred Kahn: Right. Except that I walked too slow.  T his was the af ternoonof  October 1. 

And they expected that there wouldbea lot of m ovements of peopleover the week in 

Germ any or Belgium  thatno one was noticem e.  I walked very slo wl y and I probably 

m u rmu re d s o
m ething to m yself .
 
T he lady was telling me about [Away f rom m ic] I didn't know what that was.  I didn't know m y 

father beforeandnever saw pictures.  By thetim e I hidef rom  theBelgium side, this man 

talkedtom e in French.  But I didn'tunderstand it.
 
A
ndof  course,the borders of  France, therewas anotherm an yelling som ething which I didn't 
understand.
 
He yelled " that'sm y son"  in French.
 
>> Bill Benson: You didn't know that was your father?
 
>> Fred Kahn: No. Of course not. So af ter maybe 
--
 
bear inm ind thatm y f ather spent five 
years in Belgium ,andhe was throughthe bridge, had connectionsandprobably som e phone 

calls.  Andm aybe 10 or 15 m inutes afterwards, reportedas a refugee.  I was short of 6 years 

old.
 
>> Bill Benson: And considered apolitical refugee?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson: Sonow you're in Belgium , yourf am ily is reunited with your motherand your 

father and your grandm other and your brother.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson: You would live in Belgiumf or thenext ye
ar untilW orldW ar I broke out 
--
 
>> Fred Kahn:W orldW ar II.
 
>> Bill Benson: Excuse me.  Months later inMay 1940, theGermans invaded Belgium  along 

with France and Luxem bourg.  Tell us whatyou recall about theGerm an invasion and what 

your f am ily did once that happened.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Idon't know this ver y well becausem y father had afriend inBelgian Arm ynear 

theborderand he called 5:30 in the morning on May 10 to say theGerm ans just crossedthe 

border. My f ather decided, and it was ona Friday I think. And beautif ulblue skies, I recall. 
 

And we have hada Ford car, and we all piled up in the car.  Myf ather again thought it would 

be likeW orldW ar I and that inthe Flanders, the Belgian Arm y and the English and the French 

would hold on as they 
did in World W ar I.
 
>> Bill Benson: Stop the Germ an advance.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. Went to Flanders andeventually there,therewere tons of  ref ugees. 

And Germany attacked civil ians in order to spreadpanicthere to prevent the advanceof  

English and French soldiers.  Evena Englishsoldier, and then of course we hadto jum pf rom  

the car in the ditches and probably som epeople got killed. Because of the Stuttgarts.
 
>> Bill Benson: You rem em ber that?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes.  Very dangerous.  You rem em ber when peopletry to kill you.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: I think so.
 

 
7
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Fred Kahn:T hat'swh y they were hollering.  Andpeople said how can you remem ber that?  
You were too young.  I say I can rem em ber. But then eventually the car broke down andmy 

fa
ther decidedto go with other people inthisparking lot to try to make it to go toEngland.
 
>> Bill Benson: Beforeyou tell us about that. Bef ore the car broke down, tell us about the 

B rit is h  s o ld ie r.
 
>> Fred Kahn: As we drove a British soldierasked to hitchhike withus.  He was on the running 

board.  And I recall him  saying it's a long way to temporary.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hile riding on the runway.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Andhang our dirty [Away f rom m ic] on the 6
-
foot line. T hat was the German, 
trench.  T hey bui
lda line andthen the Germans build the other lines.
 
>> Bill Benson: So you ran out of gas.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Andasa resultm y m other was now in charge.  Andby that time.
 
>> Bill Benson: Because your father is goneby this tim e?
 
>> Fred Kahn: He's gone.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:W heredid he go?
 
>> Fred Kahn: He tried to get to Englandandgot there24hours toolate. And next door to 

Dunkirk, and there was am ovie that just came out about Dunkirk. And he was trying to m ake 

it with the English and French to England
 
thesam e way as the over 300,000 Englishmen 
skewed in Dunkirk.
 
>> Bill Benson: Sonow you're without your fatherand your m otheris in charge.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. And shortly thereafter,the same day, com e down the hill the Germ an 

A r m y.   I  r em em b e r  th er
e was a French tank just turn around.  Andwe were going to stay in a 
house, ina basem ent.  Because thepeoplehad gone.  Andthe Germ an lieutenant,talkedto 

m y m other and she pretended that she was a Germ an
-
descendedperson.  And he said don't 
go in this house.  It's not solid.  Go next door.
 
So all night long I was in the basem ent and I recall like a thundernoise.
 
And themorning, when we got up,the house next door was destroyed. And then we broke up 

thehill.  I don't seehow we would have gotten back toBrussels.W e woke up and I dropped 

thebasket of eggs.  But on the lef t
-
hand sideI saw a German soldier look likehe was asleep.  
He probably was dead.
 
And suddenly outof nowhere cam ea bus with a Red Cross on it, and it stopped.  Andm y 

m other again, Germ an, he said geton and he tookus to Brussels where the Germans, the 

Red Crossf edm eand thenf rom  Brussels toa city not toofarf rom  the German border. W e 

hitchhiked back andeventually we split up. My grandmotherand brother went one way and
 
then m y mother and I. Six weeks af ter we got back, m yf ather cam e back to us.
 
>> Bill Benson: He spent six weeks 
--
 
>> Fred Kahn: He toldm ethat he actually sabotaged som eof  theGerm an phone linesor 

whatever.
 
>> Bill Benson: But he m ade his way back i
n Germ any.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yeah. He came back.
 
>> Bill Benson: Sonow you're back reunited livin g in Verviers.  Did you go to school?
 
>> Fred Kahn: From  the moment I get to Belgium , they put me in kindergarten andIm ade 

som e young f riends there, classm ates, and I would rem ain f riends with them  the rest of  their 

lif e. T oday I'm  still in contact with Facebookwith the children.
 
And then thef irst grade, I was last in the class.  I was 24out of 44.
 

 
8
 
And thenm y great report card whenI was in the third grade 
and then suddenly third out of  20.
 
But the last two months of the third grade, I got scarletfever.  And theneventually the 
Germ ans askedthe Jews to register at city hall andalso to wear a yellow star of  David. W hen 

I returned to school inthe fall of  Septem berafter the third grade, we played in an interm ission.  

Andall the other kids,m y f riends, Belgianf riends appointedm eas a sheriff. And they 

pretended to tobe cowboys andIndians.
 
But oneperson calledm e dirty Jew, in French.  So Itook m yf ist and hithim and broke his 

gla sse s.  

[Laughter]
 
It brought me to the principal. Theprincipal said, pay the glasses.And I apologized.  And the 

father of the young m an was actually selling glasses.
 
[Laughter]
 
By then theprincipal said, I was a colonel in thef irst world war andm y son escaped to 

England with the Belgian Air Force.  Andhe said I will help you to go intohiding.  Hiding 

m eaning you conceal your identity and your whereabouts.
 
As a result of that,m aybe two years laterm y father was walking andsees this wom anand she 

tells him her husbandwas Jewish and was arrested by the Gustloff .
 
I had already been trainedand learned Catholic prayers such as hail Mary and ourfather in 

heaven.
 
>> Bill Benson: Your parentsbeganpreparing.
 
>> Fred Kahn:
 
W e were preparedand also the brother of one of thebridge players told my 
father hehad abrother in the city.  And asa result of it, they received identity papers in the 

name of people who had actually lived at one tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson: Beforeyou changed your identities, Ibelieve your father was arrested.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes. That was in 1941.  My father was arrested,but then he was 
--
 
they threw 
him  down in abasem ent of the comm ander 2, which is thehead quart of  the SS.
 
And tried to give him  a hard
 
tim e to f ind out who 
--
 
they suspected however, som ebody of the 
sam e nam e, but whowas a comm unist.
 
And calling to m yf ather, f ired back, I'm  a veteran of W orldW arI and turned out eventually they 

believed him . T hey madea m istake. T hey were looking f o
r someone else.  And then of  

course adding 
--
 
during that tim e,maybe a day or so thatm y f atherwas arrested.  My m other 
went outof  her m ind of course.
 
And that added to theanxiety of  going into hiding.
 
>> Bill Benson: So in 1942, youf orm ally adopted t
he nam e of  Lejeune.
 
>> Fred Kahn: And the principal then, I just mentioned, it was only about a couple weeks 

earlier. T he principal found out a place to live, which would be saf e.  Away f rom other houses 

near af orest.  I remember becausef ora short tim e
 
we were there.  I went and picked 
blueberries in theforest there.
 
And then every f ew m onths we would move. So asnot to involve the suspicion of 

collaborators. T here were a lot of people, unfortunately, they were denounced. These people 

are Jewish.
 
An
dof  course we pretended that we were C hristian and that we had beenbom bedoutby the 
A m e rican s.  

>> Bill Benson: And of course,during that time, them ajordeportations of  Jews were taking 

place.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. On June9, 1942, I received a postcardf romm y aunt, which I 

 
9
 
consideredm y m other.  That they were going to be deported thenext day to theeast.
 
And there were 
--
 
you know, m y auntasked m y m other to take good careof m e.  Unfortunately 
when we went intotheunder ground,m y m other destroyed
 
anything that had our names on it.  
Shealways regretted it later on that shedidn't keep anything.  But what happenedthe 
following day, indeed m y auntand uncle were deported to the exterm ination camp of Sob
ib
o r 
andafew m onths ago, a Germ an research outf it. I learnedthat on transportationof the D18 

andall people were gassed on arrival.  Because they were over 50 years old.
 
>> Bill Benson: You just recently learned that?
 

>> Fred Kahn: Right. Andalso that right here in thebookstore,a book called 
"The Prisoners of  

Breendonk,"  which is in Belgium.  It is a transit camp and wentup. I tookthe book home, 

looked at it and saw the sam epictureof  the sam e uncle that was afriend of a lady in 

Germ any.
 
She was asked by Dr. Mangula, honestly, heanswered
 
with diff iculty.  And then goto thebus.  
And this otherm an who laterbecam e afam ous journalist, said, oh Iwant very well.  So he 

survi ved work ing.  And he learned later onthatm y uncle hadbeen to the bus to the people to 

the camp.
 
>> Bill Benson: That was in thebook you just recently read.
 
>> Fred Kahn: It was here in Holocaust bookstore.
 
>> Bill Benson: You describe that period of tim em oving f requently as the Lejeunefam ily.  That 

you were in what you call 
--
 

>> Fred Kahn:W as not in touch with any person of m y own age.  In other words, we wanted to 

becom eactually invisible.  Andthe other point is that 
--
 
and this happens to all Holocaust 
survi vors.  Going through this experience now m ust learn very f ast, like an adult.  
 
And then Ihad also the
 
m ission of taking care of m y grandmother who spokeonly Germ an.  
So at all tim es I had tobe with her. And one tim e we were in a local train and suddenly some 

Germ an soldiers cam e in the com partmentand m y grandmother panicked.  Shehad in her 

bag, purse
 
maybe, aBelgian newspaper.W hich was actually German. In those days there 
were no pictures in the newspaper. So shepretended she readthenewspaper hiding herself 

f rom  theGermans.  Af ter we got off and I tellm y grandm other, guess what?  You were re
ad i n g 

the newspaper upside down.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: So you described thatas a very lonely tim e for you.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Oh, yes.  I was very an xious all the tim ebecause of fear. W e're listening tothe 

BBC in French. TheBritish broadcasting corporation. And already theend of  June 1942, they 

m entioned that the Germ ans were killing, m ass m urdering the Jews.
 
So we know ver y well t hat if we got caught, we would have been killed. There'snodoubt 

about that.  Of  course,we did not go intohiding as a vacation. W e went therebecause it was 

about saving our lives.
 
And so eachday,f orm e, as I was between the ageof 10
-
12 years old, it was very stressf ul 
indeed. And I rem em ber in 1943, that when Iwandered to town, I was arrested by the Belgian 

p o lic
efor not being inschool. And infact,I had beggedf or them f or somem oney to get on a 
bus.  
 
And itturnsout tobea policem an.  Hetook me tothe police stationand interrogatedm eand I 

kept saying that m y nam e, as I'd been trained, Freddy Lejeune. 
 
And that I had, which is true, 
the scarletf ever, and Idid not want to inf ect over people.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hichis wh y you weren't in school.
 

 
10
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. Howe ver, they tookeverything out of m y pocket and af terwards, I was 
really expecting Germ ans to walk in.  And they cam ebackand askedm e, is yourm other 

blond?  Andof  coursem y m other was originally was black, butturned herself blond to pretend 

that she was Christian.
 
So they toldm e, You pull outand don't youever com e back. And six years later I would see 

them  again.  And I remem bered that,butI never told m y parents. And six years later m y 

m otherfound out about that story.
 
>> Bill Benson: How did your parentsm anage toprovide the essentials like f ood?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Fortunately, we were well off. Andm y father, oneof  the bridgeplayers, again.  

He was the head of abankand turnedall his m oney to thebank director.  You really do have 

to trust som ebody.
 
And so unf ortunately, we were to buy everyt hing f rom the blackm arket, because
 
we had no 
ration card. W e werenot registered in theplaces where we live, even thoughthe law said you 

have to register. It was city hall and youhave todothat when youm ove into aplaceor leave, 

you have to register atcity hall.  So we were really
 
invisible.  Sotheref ore, had to buy 
ever ything in the black m arket.
 
And themost important thing we could get without spendingm oney was potatoes. Som y 

grandm other was cooking, and shedid 
--
 
createdall kinds ofm eals with potatoes. And of  
course, a lot of  French f ries.
 
[Laughter]
 
So that was good.  But shem adebread with potatoes and who knows what.
 
>> Bill Benson: Fred,did anyone know your true identities?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Ithought no one knew.  Butexcept years later when somebody intervie wed m e 

fr
om  theBritish newspaper,and thenput it on the radio.  A young 
--
 
anolder wom an now 
--
 
thought I haddied.  One of the person probably have f oundout some different place toplay.  

He was a m erchant. Told her she was only 8 years old, that the Germ ans would go insideand 

k ill m e .
 
For a young girl of 18 years old, very hard to understand why anybody would kill m e. I learned 

thatnot long after,m aybe 20 years ago.
 
>> Bill Benson: Inthe fall of  1944, you hadbeen living f or two years as the Lejeunefam i
ly.  In  
thefall of 1944,af ter yourf am ily hadm oved to their f inal hiding place in thefarm ing village  of  

Oneux
-
T heux I believe it is.  Spa,Belgium . Belgium  was liberated, though the war continued 
in Europe until May of  1945. W hendid you realize you 
could com e out of  hiding?
 

>> Fred Kahn:W e watchedall day long. W ewatchedf rom  the topof thef ield. The city of 

Oneux
-
T heux, only ontop was afarm ing village.  At thebottom  was a regular city.  Andthen 
you have a slope. Sothat you could seeacross to the slope.
 
And suddenly there was always f ighting.  You heardthat. Thenoise.  And it stoppedand 

suddenly we sa w tanks com ing down with an orange thing ontop of them .
 
And m y father 
--
 
m y father now, ran 
--
 
just like that.  Andm y motherwas so af r
a i d  s om et h i ng 
would happen.  But heran acrossa bridge that had been blown upand created the Am erican 

f irst tank. T hat was how we were liberated.
 
>> Bill Benson: And I think yourf ather said that was the greatestday of his life.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Correct. 
 
W henm y parents, they cam e to the UnitedStates 15 years af ter Idid.  
In 1967.  And I told m y wife her what theanswer m y f ather would give.  September 9, 1944.  

So Iasked this question in f ront ofm y wif eand indeed, he answered, September 9,44.
 
>> B i
ll Benson: And on that date af terthat battle you said raged all day long.  Andf inally wh en 

 
11
 
it was over.  T hat in that town of Spa was a huge supply depotfor the Germ ans?
 
>> Fred Kahn: By thattim e, three months later, onm y 12th birthday, we got word th
a t th e 
Germ ans hadm adeacounteroffensive, what later becam e known as theBattle of the Bulge.  

It startedandfor three days we heard boom ,boom . A lot of noise. And I saw going up the hill 

soldiers with [Away f rom m ic] I learned later on, this was the
 
f irst time that black soldiers, 
volunteers tof ight ina battle.  Andm any got killed.  I'm  af raid thatmany people 
--
 
som e of  the 
black soldiers got caught by the Germ ans and tortured andm urdered.  And I remember thatto 

this day.
 
I tell you later more.
 
>> Bill Benson: And you had thought you were liberated 
--
 
>> Fred Kahn: Of  course.  W ehad resum edour true identity.  That's wh y it was so dangerous.  

And we walk in the snow 
--
 
it was a ver y cold winter, and we walked in the snowf or the 15 
m i l e s  t o go  
to Oneux
-
T heux and stay there in the basem ent.
 
But it was the worst part.  W hen the Am ericans and the British andthe Germans.  Eachone 

lost a lot of peopleand a lotof  theAmerican soldiers areburied in the Belgian cemetery.
 
>> Bill Benson: I like the incident you toldm eabout. Thataf ter thef ighting was o ver, the 

towns people went to the Germ an suppliesand broke in.
 
>> Fred Kahn: In the city.  People insteadof  getting Am erican soldiers went in and got ahold of  

the goods of Germ an arm ies.  Includin
g a l o t of Du tch  c i ga r s .
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:W hichyou gave to theAmerican soldiers.
 
>> Fred Kahn:T herewere troops passing by the houseandI gave them  those cigars and in 

turn, they threw chewing gum  and other stuff to us.  I wentbackto the school at the city where 

I had lived and the kids couldn't believe I was still alive.  And I gave them som e chewing gu m .
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: The war would end in May 1945 with Germ any's surrender. At what point, 

especially af ter youhad thought you were safe, you'd resumed youridentities, and then the 

Battleof theBulge began.  You were fearf ulthe Germ ans would com eback. When did you 

and your parents actually f eel that you were saf e?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Oh, after the war was over, of course. And m yf ather resumedhis business 

andplayed bridge again until he came to theUnited States. And I rem ember when the war 

was over, I was walkin g up ahill andI heardthe bells of the churchsinging all over the place.  

And it was the endof  the war.  1945.
 
And 
then a year later, I was in the6th grade and If inished number one ina city
-
wide exam .  
Don'tf orgetthat during the war, and Ididn't mention that. Theprincipal would com etous. Not 

only f ound usplaceto stay.  Buthebroughtbooks in French.  Im ust have read abook aday.  

So If inishedf irst in citywide exam .  And then in high schoolf oreign language. I learnedfour 

years of  Dutchand ofcourse I knew German.  By thetim e I came to the United States,I knew 

four languages.
 
T hen I got very active
 
i n youthactivities.  I created a soccer club, and we com peted. The 
neighborhood kidsf irst got together.  Andthen we com peted to a cham pionship of Belgium for 

18 and under.
 
In thef irst year we f inishednum ber 2. Finally 1948, we were champion of Belgium.  Andthey 

couldn't believe it. The people who have grandeured som ething couldn't believe that at that 

tim e I was only 15 or 16 years old, woulddoall that.  I still have theletter telling me how gr eat I 

wa s .
 

 
12
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: From what you've shared wit h me Fred, af ter the war, you dived into life as 
fully as possible.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:W ith your parents giving you totalf reedom. W hat does thatme tohave just 

total f reedom?
 

>> Fred Kahn: I learned beforem y m other passed away and she was in contact with m y wif e.  

She said thatm yf ather had toldher don'tbother the boy. W e're live.  So between schoolsin 

the summ er,I would hitchhikeall over Belgium ,butI couldn't gooutside of Belgium , because I 

was a stateless citi
zen.
 
And I wrotef or the newspapers in French.  And at the ageof 17 I was working by then, in 

those days they had newspapers outsideof  the store. And I seemy nam eon thef ront page of  

a newspaper.
 
Andabout the condition of peace. And it's ironic that
 
all these years af ter, I'm  still promoting 
columns. Through thelistserv that I'm managing.
 
>> Bill Benson: Fred, your parents gave you totalf reedom , but they said you could not leave 

Belgium  and go to theUnited States which you wantedtodo,until you
 
f inished high school.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right. Very insistent thatIf inish the school, which was excellent. Itfelt like a 

prep school,and we learnedabout 
--
 
I was inhumanities, economics was a m ajor.  And 
teachers were paidby the state. T hey were i nspected.  And I still rem ember most of their 

names. They were f irst
-
rate.
 
>> Bill Benson:W hatm ade you want to come tothe United States?
 
>> Fred Kahn:T he brother and sister that lived in the same town that I was in and where my 

grandm otherhad lived, left to New York in July, 1938.  At first m y uncle in New York said he 

would pay m y f are. T urns outhedidn't.  I borrowed them oney.
 
All the term s which Iactually didn't know.  First cousin provided theaff idavits to come to the 

United States asa legal citizen.  Throughappointm ent, they would pay that there would never 

be any charge of  theAm erican governm ent. And they had abusiness.
 
So Ihad an obligation to become a resident of Baltimore.  MomentIarrived got a job as a 

stock clerk and in the evening I foundm yself a jobas an usher inthe movie Avalon.  Im et 

there,movie director who m ade a lotof m ovies. T he diner.
 
>> Bill Benson: One last questionf or now, Fred,becauseour tim e is getting short.
 
>> Fred Kahn: My wat ch is broken.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'm wa tch in g it.
 
[Laughter]
 
T here's somuch you could share with usaf ter com ing to the UnitedStates, of course.  You 

joinedthearm y, you were in arm y intelligence and you went back to Germ any. What was that 

like to go back to Germ any?
 
>> Fred Kahn:T hef irst thing of course I want to go back to where Ihadbeen reared. It was 

the EasterPassover and I wentto the commander.  And If ound, I told them my story andthey 

gave m e three
-
day pass.  I arrived in the trainandm y father would com ef rom  Belgium
. 
>> Bill Benson: He let you lease by this?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Itold the trainm aster.  I said, it says I was born here.  I musthave had an 

English accent.  Afterwards, about threem onths later 
--
 
don'tforget I was in intelligence, and 
we did not wear our unif orm  inpublic. And the Germ an people would not believe thatI was an 

Am erican soldier.  How about that?
 

 
13
 
>> Bill Benson: Fred,Ithink we have timefor oneor two questionsf rom our audiencebefore 
your close out ourprogram . So let's see if  we can get a question ortwo. W e have a 

m icrophone in eachaisle.  If  youhave a question, we ask that youuse themicrophone. Make 

your question asbriefas you can.
 
I'll repeat it justto make sure that we hear it right before Fredanswers.  Anybody have a 

questi
on? Gentlem anright there raising his hand.
 
>> T hank youf or yourtim e today, sir, andthank youf or your service to this country.  Oneof  

them ajorelem ents of the Jewishf aith is the bar m itzvah.  How were they handled?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Inever hadone as a result of  it.  Andalso where we lived in Verviers, we only 

knew onefam ily who was half
-
Jewish. T hehusband was Jewish and the wif e was Germ an.  
T here was no synagogue there,and of course during the war, I was never barmitzvahed. And 

m y f atherand motherwere not religious.  T hough m y grandm other, shehad the Bible 
--
 
t he  
T orah. And she ref used to give it up.
 
And she readtheBible every sin gle day.
 
>> Bill Benson: So she had it during the whole time?
 
>> Fred Kahn: Yes, I still have it. T hat book is religious bookthat datesback to 1850.  But as 

a result,I never 
--
 
m y wif e, she was Buddhist.  Turned into Jewish. She learned Hebrew. She 
thinks it's thebest congregation here in Bethesda.  Ibelieve in Godver y much so, but not 
--
 
right now. W eforget about som ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:W e'renot forgetting about it. I prom ise. One last question. W e're not going to 

forget aboutthat. Letm e just say that afterwards Fred is going to sign copies of the FredKahn 

story, and that will also allow you to ask otherquestion.
 
>> T hank you very m uch f or your presentation, Fred.  I'm f rom  Australia and what struckme 

was you were the benef iciary of asylum  and the benef iciary of being received into countries to 

protect youand your f am ily. W hat sortof  the 
m essages do you think we need to hold onto 
when it comes to how we how we protect people seeking asylum  and ref ugees.
 
>> Bill Benson: Thankyou for that question. I think Fred is going toprobably speak to thatin a 

sense whenhe concludes our program .  Sowe'll do that if that's OK.  All right. W eare out of 

tim e, unfortunately.
 
Please corner Fred afterwards f or additionalquestions.
 
I want to thank you all for being with us. W e'll have two m ore First Person program s.
 
W e'll have m ore inf ormation on our 
program when we resum e in March 2018.
 
It is ourtradition thatour First Personhasthe last word.W ith that, Fred please share your 

thoughts to close today's program .
 
Please stay for a couple seconds when Fred is done,becauseour photographer is going to
 
com e and takea photo of Fred with you as the background.W e'll try and get Freduptheaisle 

as quickly as possible so he can sign copiesof  the Fred KahnStory.
 
>> Fred Kahn:T hanks.  I'm  alive today because of  goodpeople who is stood up to evil.  T o 

m e, theirpersonalf ight, the strength, the righteous strengthof  thehuman spirit.
 
I have lived also,personally, an authentic lif efor m yself and others.
 
Now I tell you wh y I still have m uch hope in the hum an race. W henm y uncle turned me over 

to  tha t l
ady thattook me tothe border.  A lady I had never m et before in his life.  He was 
overcom e by em otionand I learnedaboutthat only long after the war.  Many years af ter.
 
He thought thathem ay never ever see m eagain.  Sohehad on him self a very precious thing.  

Andasked the lady tom ake surethat if  everhe would not survive, that she wouldm ake sure 

that she would keep it and give it tom e.  Andso today, If inish the talk by showing you what he 

 
14
 
gave to her.
 
Solid gold watch that she could have soldduring the war, whatever.  Nobody knew that she 
had it.  Andaf terthe war she'd managed to get it tom e andhere it is.  And it was a repeated 

watch.  Unf ortunately, I cannotopen it,but you can hear it.
 
>> Bill Benson: Put it up to yourm icrophone.
 
>> F
red Kahn:W hy don't you? BecauseI don't have the strength in m y arm s. You can push 
on that.  And it still wor ks.
 
[Tone playing]
 
>> Fred Kahn:T herewe go.  That's terrif ic. Andnow that watch was given to that lady 79 

years ago.
 
>> Bill Benson: And she
 
got it back to you after the war.
 
>> Fred Kahn: Right.  I did not know 
--
 
I know, heprobably took heraside. And Inever knew 
about ituntil I received thepackage with it and a letter explaining why.  As I mentioned, she 

could have 
--
 
no one knew that shehad it.  She safely 
--
 
and Idon'tknow her.  So I accepted 
af ter the war, according to m yf ather, she workedfor the British Army.
 
She was a German.
 
And just like thef irstboy f riend I had. W alter was Germ an.  And we lived in a place wherethe 

land 
lady, bef ore we went into hiding, was sort of  Germanf rom the part of Germany that was 
gi ven to Belgium .
 
And shearrangedform y f athertom eet with next door to us, them an who was in charge of the 

Germ an arm y in that town.
 
And so they m et, andhe told us
 
as long as he was there, nothing wouldhappen toourfam ily.  
But he couldnot guarantee what was af ter.  He told him, according to m yfather,betweenfour 

guys, get lost.  Or I would if  I was in your case.  Andthat was another German who was not a 

Na zi.
 
So you see asa resultof it,personally I hadnothing againstthe Germ ans exceptactually the 

m urderers.  In som e cases, sadists. And the m ore than I learnabout the Holocaust through 

them anaging the[Away from  m ic] which I was asked totake over three
 
years.  And it'son 
Yahoo. 325m em bersf rom  five different countries. W e really dig into that.
 
Andof  course if I would encounter, I was anAm erican soldier and Iwould encountera Germ an 

Nazi, I would probably kill him . T hat's it. And of  course I con
tinue preaching about m aking my 

wif e also.W e arehuman rights activists in awa y, not of any organization, but inour way.  And 

onething is when If irst came to the United States,I was shocked tof ind thatdiscrim ination 

occurredagainst people because
 
of their skin color.
 
Having sur vi ved, andnow I find out probably, back of m y m ind,I decide never to look downon 

people because of thewa y they appear.
 
Inf act,m ost of the time I think never pass a judgm ent on people. So that. And asa result of  

that
, I becam ethe vice president of the international cluband gave m y idea of presidential 
debates.  And you learn about that if  youbuy thatbook.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: Thankyou, Fred! T hank you.
 
[Applause]
