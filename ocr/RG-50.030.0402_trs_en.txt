RUTH ZELLNER 
 October 13, 1999 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Ca n we begin by having you te
ll us your full name  at birth? 
Answer: Okay. I like to talk. Li
ke -- we -- we lived in Germany, 
very, very nicely in Breslau. 
Q: Can I get you to say your full name? 
A: Oh. 

Q: Your name. 

A: My name  is Ruth Zellner. I was born in
 Germany, Breslau, which now is Polish, called 
Wr oclaw. Poland always moved around after each 
war. That™s why my father, who was born in 
Germany, in Posen, also his hometown became Po
lish and we ended up on the Polish quota for 
the United St ate, which ma de all the difference in the world. 

Q: Can you tell us when you were born? 
A: If I have to. I was born in 1920, which ma ke
s me  now al most 79, I have a birthday pretty 
soon. So I™m not so young any mor e . But I™m one of the few who was old enough to know wha t  

was going on, and then still around. The little kids
, the Ame r ican newcomers, but they don™t 
reme mber. The old people are gone. 

Q: Can you tell us the exact date of your
 birth?  The exact date of your birth? 
A: We move d in -- 

Q: Of your birth. The -- 
the day you were born. 
A: Oh, the birth. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Decembe r first, 1920.

Q: Okay. 
A: My parents had ma rried after the war. My father
 had been a front soldier. And of course when 
Hitler came, he said that some  soldiers, Jewi
sh me n who had fought for the Fatherland, they 

would be not hurt in any way, whic
h of course was a lie. My father was a very prominent lawyer, 
ma de a lot of money, we  lived very nicely and 
comfortable. He was also, as a lawyer, not 
prepared to move to a different country with 
different law. A doctor ca
n move anywhere, learn 
the language and check the people. My father, by 
the time  we got here was 60, and he -- he did -- 
his English was pretty grim. So there he -- we all 
had to start over. Now, before we get here, let 
me  tell you where it began. 

Q: Could we begin also by having you say the --
 the name  of your mother and the name  of your 
fat her. 

A: Okay. 

Q: The full name -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q -- and your mother™s ma iden na me, if you know it. 

A: Yes. My father was Mac Zellner. My mothe
r™s name  was  Gertrude Markus, M-a-r-k-u-s. She 
was one of the first women who got a doctor™s degr
ee, at a time when most of them didn™t even 
have high school, she started at the University of
 Breslau, and had a PhD. She never used it, too 
bad, but she -- she was a very in
telligent woma n, and that helped. My father studied law in 
Germany, a nd he was just a young lawyer when he
 was drafted into the army. After he came 
back, he met my mother and they were married
 very shortly after. You know, after the war, 
there™s always -- the me n come home, the same th
ing after this war, th
ey want to settle down. 
We were two children, I am Ruth, my sister w
ho was younger, was Margaret. And we lived in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402

plain pl ace in the beginning, because you couldn™t 
get anyt hing. Then we had a very be autiful 
home . And we were beginning to look to come  to
 the United State. We  did get a visa from my 
father™s cousin, whose parents had come  to the St at
es already, we didn™t know her. But, as I said, 
the Polish quota was oversubscribed
 by that time in ™37 or so when
 we started looking. You just 
couldn™t get on it any more. So we looked around 
to see if there was any pl ace that we could 
wait, like for instance, Cuba. 
Q: I-I want to spend a little more time 
on your childhood. Do you know anything about your 
grandparents from either side?  Do you 
reme mber them, do you know their name s?  
A: My father™s parents had died long before me . 
I  some where have a little
 fa mily tree, but it™s 
not very helpful. They must have been born earl
y in the previous centur
y. My mother™s parents I 
knew, but they too -- my grandfather died 
very early of a gallbladder operation. My 
grandmother, we had to leave her be hi nd, because
 she was old and a little weak. We couldn™t 
have left with her. So wi -- my parents took her 
into a Jewish home  in Br
eslau, paid forever, and 
one thing I really like to me nti
on that, we had a lovely cook with
 us forever, she was a very 
devoted Catholic lady. And when my grandmother 
went to that home, she rearranged for her to 
have a job there, so my grandmother had somebodywho was fa miliar. Wh at we were told is that 

she died in the home. I hope it™s true. I come  b
ack to that life -- cook of
 ours later. As a -- my 
childhood wa s all right. When things became diffic
ult, I left the school where I was, because 
these were the daughters of the big shots of Nazis,
 and my pa rents sent me  to a school run by the 
church. The teachers were not nuns or  anythi ng, 
but they were [indecipherable] with everybody 

was from the church. There were quite a few Jewi
sh kids there. In the beginning when we came, 

the teacher would come  in [indecipherable] crys
tals, I don™t know if 
you understand that. When 
Hitler came, heil Hitler. So that wasn™t so great 
after awhile, but they were very dedicated to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
4 
 
helping the Jewish kids. But in ™37, things becam
e too uncomfortable, and I went to the Jewish 
school. I still measure [indecipherable] I don™t know 
what -- if you know what 
that is, it™s a little 
more than the metric. Some of my children from 
my school got two years credit in college here 
for what -- our exam. Ye ah. Many of those who got
 a lot of credit were 
veterans. So they, of 
course, they were very helpful. Whe n I sent 
my paper to Wa shington, or Albany I think it was, 
they didn™t get too hysterical a
bout it. I didn™t get credit, but I 
never studied for credit. I only 
took the courses I needed for my work. [indeciph
erable] jump ed ahead. Then, in ™39, we were 
told that the -- no, I think I 
want to tell you about the 10
th
 of November, that was the 
Kristallnacht .  
Q: But before we get there, I™d like to spe
nd a little bit more time on your childhood, and your 

schooling. You just me ntioned that when you were younger, you went to -- you implied that you 

went to a mi xed school of Ger mans that were no
n-Jews, and Jews. Could 
you tell us more about 
that?  How did the children get along? 
A: Before Hitler, fine, they didn™t know the 
difference, you ha d friends all over. Once Hitler 
came, those who were your friends, were your fri
ends, but they wouldn™
t invite you any more, 
you wouldn™t invite them. It was diffi
cult, it got stranger. The last y
ear that I was in the Catholic 
school, I was the only Jewish girl 
in my class. Lunchtime, nobody talked to me . I was  -- it wasn™t 
that they didn't  like me, but they were afraid. Thei r father s had positions in the Nazi party, and 
she has a Jewish girlfriend?  Th
ey couldn™t take the chance. Bu
t by that time , I was 17, and I 
really didn™t like 
it there any more. As a matter of fact, 
there was a school in
 Berlin where the 
children of the em-embassies, American, Englis
h, would go and learn English, and speak -- get 

their own education, the British educ
ation. And I wanted to go there. I thought that would be the 
right thing to do. My parents didn™
t want me to do that because th
ey thought if there™s a quick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402

emigration, I™d be in Berlin, they™d
 be in Breslau. They said, if you don™t want to be in the -- in 
the Catholic school, go to the Jewish school. I 
was very happy there, I was one -- one among 
equals. I was relaxe d, we had a lot of fun, until th-the Kristallnacht. 

Q: H-How did you -- how did you understand what 
was beginning to happen?  Did your parents 
speak to you about it?  Did you speak with your pa
rents when you got home , for instance from 
the school?  

A: I had the papers. They said this paper is not in the national interest, it will be suspended for 

two weeks. Well the two weeks are 60 years now.
 So I mean, I saw what™s going on. Also, you 
had all these Hitler talks on the radi o, and were
 -- this was a ve ry noisy way of controlling 
people, they were ma rching along. But it did not r
eally affect me  so much. And when I was in 
the Jewish school, we had our own swi mmi ng pool. So
 what did I care?  And 
that -- there was a -- 

a th-theater group, Jewish, concert Jewish. So the 
last year, when Hitler really was getting going, 
it was a cocoon, a ghetto. Which I didn™t even
 mind, I was too young, I was happy. There were 
nice boys, there were nice girls. 
So what™s wrong with that?  And as
 I said, y -- that came to the 
Kristallnacht . Until that time , life wa s okay, I 
knew I would be leaving Germany, and everybody 
wanted to. But there was no hardship yet,
 thank God, that came after we left.  

Q: C-Can you talk a little bit abou
t home life, even before Kristallnacht, really, the early 30™s, the 
mi d-1930™s. Wh- What was it like to be in your h
ouse?  What was your mother like?  How -- how 
did your family spend time together? 

A: It™s -- to tell you the truth, I t
ook it so for granted, that I can 
hardly tell you. I went to school 
in the morning, I came home. It was a big nice ap
artment, and I -- in -- I reme mber once I left 
Germany, I had a shock. When you took your dirty 
boots off, they didn™t come  back clean by 
themselves. The cook did it, so -- I took that fo
r granted. Th-There were so ma ny things that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
6 
 
later thought, gee whiz [indeciphera
ble] spoiled. I was not spoiled, be
cause we were told to clean 
our room, to do this and that. But still and all, I re
me mber one of the girls, one Jewish said to me , 
ﬁThis is a nice pin, is it real? ﬂ
 ﬁI wouldn™t wear costume jewe
lry.ﬂ And you know, these things 
stay with you. And one of the girls -- and also, as
 I said, before Hitler, invited me  to her home. 
And I said, ﬁMom, you s a y these people are poor, th
ey have five rooms, we only have six.ﬂ So 
my mother said, ﬁHow big were the five room
s?  As big as our living room? ﬂ  I learned. You 
know, it -- that™s why when you asked me , it seemed
 so terrible away from it. I lived in the 
moon. And of course, anything I wa
nted I had. When te -- again my
 parents trained me . I know I  
wanted to have a writing thing like this, you 
know, with envelopes and everything. I bought it. 
But it was 15 ma rks ma ybe. My father said, ﬁNo. P
oor children have to live on that for a week. 
You return it, and you get your money back.ﬂ So
 I knew you can™t just buy anything you wanted. 
But what you needed, you got plenty. So if you must
 -- if you reme mber my 
life before Hitler, if 
some body who lived not on Park or Fi fth Avenue
, but on the Upper East Side, going to the 
schools that you knew and knowing the people you we
re supposed to know. But when you are 12 
- 13, you are not [indecipherable] very ofte
n, nowadays they are more than then.  
Q: Can you tell us some  about your father? A-A-
A-Again, during this pre-Hitler time , before a 
lot of anxiety had come  about for the Jewish community? 
A: We ll, my  father was very well known. He wr ote a column for the newspaper about anything 

new in laws. When the laws was the --  not Hitler
 law, he had a reserved column, whene ver he 

wanted to write. He had the clients from here 
to there, very important cases. He was a very 
charmi ng man, and a very good speaker. So he woul
d tell socially anecdote about all the doctors 
and lawyers in Breslau. He was very well known 
at the -- by the judges. His word counted. I 
don™t know if I should tell you one case that™s r
eally -- by that time Hitler was [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
7 
 
already. There was a couple, an Austrian woma n 
and a Germa n ma n, and the laws were that -- I 
have to get this -- they wanted to get marrie
d. And the laws are, you have to go by the ma rriage 
laws of your home  country. Th
e woma n was Austrian and Ca t
holic, and couldn™t divorce and 
ma rry that ma n. So they had ma ny cases, I mean, th
ey tried it, no. Then my father got the case, 
and my father, as a Jew said, I think I have an an
gle. It  is important to the German country to 
have strong German children. If you keep that 
woman from marryingtheman, having children, 
then it is agai nst the national interest and the 
Austrian law should not apply. My father won the 
case. The judge said, ﬁAs a Jew, you really ma de 
a case.ﬂ My father said, ﬁI™m a lawyer.ﬂ The 
joke was, she was over 45. No children. It™s just 
one of the stories that I reme mber. But I mean, 
he had an angle. He knew what -- and it -- he wasn
™t sarcastic, he had a client and he worked for 
it. He also said -- and that is very different fr
om l a wyers here, for every marriage, divorce, he 
reunited half the people. He said it is not righ
t to take money if you can
 protect a life. Another 
thing I reme mber from my father as a young lawyer
, he worked -- he was associated with a mu ch 
older ma n. They went for a com -- how shall I say?  
It was -- it [indecipherab
le] of a contract they 
were working on. They spent five hours on that. Even
tually they hashed it out. My father and his 
me ntor went back to the office. The older ma
n opened the drawer, took out the contract which 
was almost exactly what they came to. He had wr itten that before. And he said to my father, 

when you argue with people, or have a contract w
ith them, you™ve got to reme mber their point of 
view. You don™t say it in the be
ginning, but you have to know how far you can come  to ma ke 
them meet. I wish they had it now in a few places. So, I mean, my father had a very solid 

background, but my mother said she used to go to
 court when he was pleading, sit in the back 
and monitor it. She would tell him what the reac
tion was of the people, also whether his voice 
carried. I was too young. I would have  loved to go 
because I was always fascinated by the law, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
8 
 
and as a kid I was reading all hi
s law books. Some of them weren™t so kosher. I mean, some  of 
them had things there that [indecipherable]. So I le
arned a lot. I used to tell the other kids what 
was going on, you know, things that nowadays you read
 it in every book, but in those days -- my 
parents didn™t mi nd. They always felt that what
 I can learn, okay. As a matter of fact, I had a 
reputation. My mother used to say -- and then 40
 years later the people in my office said it, you 
cannot keep secrets from Ruth. My mother said 
to my father, ﬁIf -- she will always find out and 
tell everybody. But if you tell her it™s a secret, sh
e not say peep.ﬂ And that was from when I was 
12 til I was 80. Well, it was funny. 
Q: Can you speak some  about the role of faith 
in your fa mily?  The role of religion in your 
fa mily? 

A: The what? 

Q: The role of religion. 

A: Oh, religion, all right. 
Q: H-How -- how -- h-how did it play a part in your fa mily? 
A: I see, yeah. We ll, I tell you, my father ha
d been -- I mean, everybody 
came from a religious 
fa mily, that really --  they were
. My father, as a student had been
 at the fraternity that was not 
Jewish. Most of the Jewish professionals, lawyer
s, had belonged to -- I forgot the name, what -- 
casaya, I think. My father was not. I don™t 
know if you know then, st
udents fought with 
[indecipherable] and he had a star. As a ma tter 
of fact, when my father died here, he had 
collapsed and was in the hospital, and a very ni
ce doctor took care of him, 
but he was very aloof. 
They thought he was a German Nazi. As it turned
 out, when we -- when my father died, they 
asked if we would allow an autopsy, and my sister
 said, ﬁYes, but the funeral mustn™t be delayed 
because we are Jewish.ﬂ That ma n fell over. He sa
id, my God. I mean, he had been professional, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
9 
 
but he™d rather not. But I [indeci
pherable] get into details about it. But this was -- my fa ther 
didn™t look Jewish, he had a very
 -- I wouldn™t say arrogant, but dominating. When he came in, 
you knew it. And one time  that I was still in Br
eslau, a woman came up to me  and said, ﬁAre you 
Ruth Zellner? ﬂ  And I said yes. She said, ﬁI 
recognized you by your father™s walk, and by your 
mother™s red hair.ﬂ This was red. So you know 
it -- people knew us. My mother came from a 
much more Orthodox background. My great-grandfathe
r, her grandfather was a cantor and very -
- very well known too. So when they ma rried, of 
course as a st udent, my mother was free will -- 
I mean, a respectable lady, but it was unusual to be
 a student. But she said she wanted a Jewish 
home , so we had a kosher home. Pass over dishes 
and all this. And I hated Passover because my 
grand -- great-grandfather, the cantor, ma de 
it last forever. And I couldn™t understand. He 
[indecipherable] the maid took me home early, 
but not early enough for me . Then my father 
come back the Seder after my great -- great-gran
dfather died, then he ma de it very interesting. 
And he -- some ti me s in -- you know, during the end 
of the -- rather the 
beginning of the Hitler 
time, ma ny people realized that there were Jews w
ho hadn™t much of an idea. So we would invite 
these people to let them join in
 a Seder, they™d never seen such
 a thing. And my father always -- 
he doesn™t just [indecipherable] down this th
ing, he would stop and ma ke very interesting 
comparison, so it was a very nice Seder. He di
ed right after the Seder on Passover ma ny years 
later. So Seder has -- now I don™t like it so much
 any more. So the -- otherwise, my parents were 
me mbers of the Jewish co mmunity. There were Jewish clubs, even before  Hitler. The B™nai 

Brith, and the Society of [indeci
pherable] and of course on th
e high holiday, people went to 
synagogue or  dresse d up with their prayer books
, until Hitler came . Then you didn™t dress up, 
you didn™t have -- show your pray
er book, you just sort of sneaked
 in into a little some thing. 
There were several synagogues in Breslau, Orth
odox, I don™t think you would call of a me mber 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
10 
 
of the Reform -- not even Conservative, it wa
s a Modern. Very nice 
rabbis and a beautiful 
building, burned down. 
Q: Do you reme mber the name ?  

A: Of the synagogue? 

Q: Yes. 

A: New synagogue. And the old one, I don™t know w
hy, it was called the [indecipherable]. It™s -- 
that™s animal. I don™t know, ma ybe 
it was the shape of it. They c
ould not burn that down because 
too ma ny Nazis lived around the houses there. Bu
t ours -- I ma y even have a picture. Gee, I 
didn™t think of it. Maybe when we have a lunc
h break. What a beautiful building. And weddings, 
I reme mber the older sister of a fr iend of mi ne, who had a wedding that  was still before Hitler 

became to -- too much of a nuisance, with 
the long, white velvet gown, marching down for a 
mile, like Saint Patrick™ s. This -- but of course
, that stopped too. Otherwise -- I mean, we were 
part of the Jewish community, and there was a 
Jewish community paper, and I reme mber they 
had a lot of family announcement of course, 
you know how it is, it is 
like patting on your 
shoulder, the big shot this and 
the big shot that. And they also
 lived that, the 
little boys who 
became Bar Mitzva h. And when I saw the big brothe
r of my girlfriend was listed, I was so grown 
up. Then, after awhile, the older 
sisters of my friends got enga
ged, more grown up. I must have 
10 years [indecipherable]. And these papers were 
very nice. I don™t know if you™ve heard of the 
Aufbrau. That was formed here in the early 30. 
And here too, they had announcement of things 
that happened in the Je wish immi grant community
, and people -- also afterthe war -- I want to 
go ahead on that now, when people came  over from the camps , they would have long lists of 

newcomers, where relatives could meet again. Well,
 now they have a few obits. And that™s just 
the way it goes, it™s also 60 years. But I reme mb er
 the Jewish -- Breslau Ge me indeplatt. It me ant, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
11 
 
the community, the Jewish community of Breslau. 
That was pretty cohesive. I™m not sure how 
ma ny peopl e were there, but it was a lot. They are gone. 
Q: Do you know anything about where your father
 fit politically in theJewi sh community?  Wa s 
he a me mbe r  of groups, was he ever called on 
to -- to me diate things?  Wa s your father -- 
A: No, my father wasinvolved 
in Jewish thing, as I said, th
e B™nai Brith, and the other 
organization. Otherwise, before Hitler it di dn™t ma
tter whether people were  Jewish or not. That --  
you see, in ma ny ways the German J e ws, of the e ducated, professional class were so integrated, 

much more even than here. You just didn™t know
. And you didn™t ask, I mean, Dr. Zellner, who -
- what are you, Catholic, Jew?  Nobody 
cared. But that came down with a bang.  
Q: What language did you speak at ho
me?  What language was spoken at home? 
A: In Germa ny? 

Q: Yes. In Breslau. 

A: Yeah, German.  
Q: German.  
A: No, I don™t even understand Yiddish. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I can dope it out when I see it, because 
you know, Ger ma n people thought Yiddish was 
vulgar. It was bad Germa n. It isn™t, it™s a langua
ge in its own and they bring it up again. But the 

only language we spoke was Germa n. And it what
 they call high Germa
n. I -- I personally was 
very good. I reme mber when I wrote essays in sc
hool. One day we had to write one -- that was 
the -- not Nazi school, it™s one of the earlier ones, I was ma ybe 13. The teacher gave us 

[indecipherable] of paper and said, I want to re
ad to you a story, how that
 subject should have 
been addressed. So how interesting, she read my
 story. I was so surprised. And when I had -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
12 
 
ma y not know when -- you have [indecipherable] 
too, as you have a choice subject. You are 
being examined in three or four things, and one you can choose because  you think you are most 

interested in. So I had chosen
 Germa n literature. And by that
 time the Jewish school was not 
allowed to conduct its own exa ms any more. We had 
to have one of the Nazi big shots supervise 
the whole thing. He was great. He was wonderful. 
You know, that was always -- they were such 
nice people, but they -- most of 
the time  they™re afraid to come  out. Now this one examined me , 
and everybody was laughing because  I really felt so at home with [indecipherable] and Schiller 

and all that stuff. I don™t know how much you know 
about them. So I™m saying that to show how 
integrated we  were. And the -- some  of the Nazi
 -- none of the Nazi teachers I had in the 
Catholic school were evil, because the religi
on balanced that. They were hi gh in the party 
because they had to be, but when they could 
help you, they did. But God forbid it would come  
out. That would have hurt them, and also their families. So that was one of the reason that people 

went along. They did try to have 
-- when I get to the -- the 10
th
 of Nove mb er, I™ll tell you some  
of that. Do you have eno
ugh of my first chapter? 
Q: Pretty much. I do have a few mo re questions I would -- 

A: I talked more about it than
 I had planned, but if you have a
ny other questions on my old past. 
Q: We ll you™ve s -- you™ve talked 
about being very integrated, th
e -- the -- the Jews and the non-
Jews. What did your parents teach you about bei
ng German?  Did they talk to you about that -- 

that you are a German citizen, that you™re a 
pa triot?  Wa  -- this is when you™re younger. 
A: I don™t think my parents made speeches, th
ey lived it. We  knew the Jewishness by being 
kosher. We knew the non-Jewishness by having books, all the German literatures, and we were 

supposed to read it. I mean, they didn™t sit down a
nd say this is that and this is this. A few weeks 
ago, I saw an obit in the Time s that a ma n [ind
ecipherable] died. He was the son of a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
13 
 
important Weimar official. I don™t think he was 
the president, but he 
was a chancellor or so. 
[indecipherable] all the Jews voted for him. Th
ere was some  [indecipherabl e] who was a Jew, 
and had -- I don™t remember which position. So they were in the highest government position 
between ‚24 and ‚33. I don™t know if you know about
 the inflation. After 
the war, the German 
money wasn™t worth anything, if you had a suitcase
 full of mo ney. My father said he would get 
paid with shoes for me , because when people got
 paid, they went to the bank, it wasn™t worth 
anything, million, bi llion. Then von Schacht, who 
was later on a Nazi, straightened things out 
and in ™24 it stabilized, and 
between ™24 and ™32, there were
 ma ny i mpor tant Jews in the 
governme nt, in art, in the Berlin, the plays,
 the music, ma ny name s that came  over here 
eventually. It was a very blooming, bloomi ng positiv
e thing, and we were part of it. My mother 
and father we nt to the theater, they told us wh
at the big pl ays were. So
 we were never -- we 
never sat down and got told the f
acts of life, I don™t mean that th
is way, but we just lived it. I 
don™t know how that is here with th
e rich people, but we were very 
close. My parents were not -- 
I mean, they had the big social life, but we were 
part of that [indecipherable] their children. So 
they knew who we were dealing with. 

Q: A-And can you tell us just a bit moreabout what your father
 did during World Wa r 
1
? 
A: He was at the Belgians [indecipherable] a
nd he said he -- well, I don™t know what you know 
about Germany. Gerta had the [indecipherable] the 
[indecipherable] was the Easter walk, a very 
fa mous part of it, and my  father told me , as
 a young s-soldier, on Easter Sunday there was no 
shooting, and he walked along the dema rcation re
ading that part of the [indecipherable]. You 
see, that came  through. I mean, I still can reci
te [indecipherable]. And that how we were 
integrated, Gerty, Schiller, all these things were
 part of everyday life. He came  -- that™s 
some thing he told me  too, he was a young soldier, I have to really reme mber that. And a soldier 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
14 
 
was supposed to salute an officer. He wasn™t payi
ng attention, he was walking when an officer -- 
that was not at the front, it wa
s -- he was on furlough. And the o
fficer said, ﬁSoldier, why didn™t 
you salute me?ﬂ My father said -- he  was quick
 thinking, ﬁWe were under an overpass.ﬂ In a 
covered room, the soldier doesn™t salute. So th
e officer said, ﬁ What we
re you in private life? ﬂ 
Father said, ﬁA lawyer.ﬂ Figur
es. You know, I haven™t thought of
 [indecipherable] thing, but you 
sure brought them out. But this gives you a pi
cture of the atmosphere, which changed.  
Q: Can you think back to when you begin to be aw
are of some  of the first changes? Was -- was 
there some  day your father came home and talked
 about something that had happened, or -- 
A: No. As a ma tter of fac t , I reme mbe r  I said 
to my father once, if you -- if they don™t want 
Jewish law you have to work any mo
re, how will we live? And my fa
ther says, ﬁI still have some  
client .ﬂ Also my father had -- board renter ap
artments, and we will live on that. And I™ll be 
writing articles for the paper. I was reassured, of
 course none of it work
ed. He didn™t have any 
clients any more, the papers wouldn™t publish h
im any more, and they took the houses away. As 
a ma tter of fact, we got the list when we we
re here, what had happened to all the houses 
[indecipherable] bomb, a nd taken away. And my fath
er gave it to my br
other-in-law, and said, 
ﬁThis is your dowry.ﬂ So we survived it. But -- 

Q: Are you -- you™re referring, I thin
k, to that you heard a-at -- at
 a certain point, the Nazi party 
went into the courtrooms and 
said that Jewish lawyers a
nd Jewish judges could no longer 
practice. So you must have heard about that
 and you asked your father about that? 
A: Well, as I said in the beginning, there was 
no interfering, because when you had the -- the -- 
were a front soldier, you had bled for the Father
land. Even peop -- later on, 
even people with the 
Iron Cross and all the decoration, the wounded one
, they were kicked out. It was limited. 
Eventually my father closed up his office and 
moved into our apartment. Then, when he took 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
15 
 
down the shingle, he wasn™t -- he was rather 
depressed. And my mother said to him, better you 
take it out than I do afterward. So
 -- but I -- when that came to
 that point, we were looking for 
emigration, and of course I noticed that. But un
til I think I wa s about 
14, I wasn™t too much 
involved. 

Q: What did your mother mean, better that you do
 that than I do it afterward?  What did your 

mother mean? 

A: My -- 

Q: About the shingle, when your father took th
e shingle down, and then your mother said, better 
you do it then I do 
it afterward. 
A: After you™re dead. 

Q: Oh, after you™re dead. 

A: She™d rather have a living husband who took 
down the shingle, depressing as it was after 30 
years, than for her as a widow having to taking 
it down. She felt, as long as we are together. My 
mo -- you know some body said to me  once here, in 
this country, ﬁNow that your father is doing 

all kind of work, is he still the same  ma n he was 
as a lawyer?ﬂ And I said ﬁYes, in my mother™s 
eye, yes.ﬂ And you know, ma ny refugee families br
oke up. You know, the big shot wasn™t so big 
any more. And my parents had a very good ma rriage. 
Very -- I don™t -- if -- I me an, it wasn't  the 
kind of hugging, kissing. My father never was 
mu ch for hugging, kissing, my mother a little 
more. But there was a great respect and understa
nding, and affection. Anything else from that 
time? 

Q: Try to tell us a little bit about when your father took that shingle down, how -- at that point 

how was -- how were -- how was your fa mily
 earning income for you to survive? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
16 
 
A: We ll, we had a lot of money, and that was not 
yet f -- that was only conf
iscated when we left. 
I think if -- I mean, when they confiscated it, th
at was that. But I know that financially until we 
left Germany, there was no hardship. At the big 
time , we had a cook and a ma id and a nursema id 
and all that st uff, which eventually we didn™t ha
ve  any more because we didn™t want  Nazi people 
in the house. We  wanted -- our ma nsion was so lo
vely and loyal. But my grandmother, who was 
old, she lived in our building on a lower floor, 
in a small apartment, so my mother could 
supervise her. She had a nurse and a ma id w
ho made breakfast and 
lunch. Dinner was ma de 
upstairs and the ma id brought it down. We  didn'
t trust those two wome n, so we brought my 
grandmother up. You see, that™s how we noticed 
things, the office was upstairs, my grandmother 
was upstairs. The ma id [indecipherable] this and that was gone. But it didn't hurt me , you know, 

it didn™t interfere with 
my everyday life. My parents could 
tell you everything, but I wa s coasting 
along, and they took the people to concentration 
camps, and smashed the windows, that I saw. 
Well -- ooh, I don™t want to rip -- excuse me. 
Q: Do you reme mber your parents discussing at all,
 other options f-f-for leaving, plans -- perhaps 
even -- perhaps an eventual plan to hide you and 
your sister?  What kinds of
 things were talked 
about?  
A: Me -- I reme mber, I knew that 
we were trying to get an affida
vit. I also reme mber that my 
mother asked some  relative who lived here alrea
dy, who had come  to visit, to find the name  of 
my father™s cousin, which she said she coul
dn™t find. Then some body else emigrated, she asked 
that man to sign some name and we got it in tw
o weeks. My mother ne
ver forgot that woma n, 
because she said if we had gotten it, we could 
have gotten out with mone
y, we -- and if -- if it 
was up to that wome n, we would all have been 
killed. I mean, my mother, she was smart, she 
never told the lady that she hate
d her. But -- and the other ma n, the one who was not even related 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
17 
 
or anythi ng, she always, whenever there was an 
occasion, there was a gift from us. She  -- she 
said he saved our lives. Some thing else of my 
mother is I told you she was a chemist. She had, 

when things got wh -- cyanide. She said if they 
came  for us she would have given us a lemonade 
with cyanide, we would have been dead without
 knowing it. She was not having her fa mily taken 
to a camp. Took some  do
ing, but we got out. 
Q: Why was  the name  of the cousin so 
important to the process of getting out? 
A: The name of what?  Of -- 

Q: Your father™s cousin, why 
was that name  so important?   
A: We ll, they were very wealthy people here, and th
at if -- they did give us
 the affidavit when we 
finally reached them. But here too, a year before
 we came, the husband ha d died. He was a very 
prominent ma n, who had helped a lot of refugee 
getting settled. He would arrange -- he was in 
real estate -- for instance one ma n, a young ma n, got
 a contract to do the 
hardware for building. 
If he had been alive he would have guided my father into some business, we would still have had 
money to work with. You know, in those years it
 was a depression, if you
 had a thousand dollars 
in your pocket, you had a lot, people earned 10 
dollars a week. So by losing about two years, 
which also was a Polish quota, and the cousin w
ho gave it to us was a widow and old, and she 
was sweet, she invited us for Thanksgiving [indecipherable] you know. 
Q: What was the name  of the cousin that -- th
at was so important?  
Your  fa t h e r ™ s  c o us i n?  
A: Mayer, yeah. 

Q: Zellner? 

A: Mayer, M-a -- I would rather you don™t me
ntion the name  though, because the children and 
grandchildren by now, I ga -- don™t 
know how much they are even involved, but they were very 
prominent people, and nice people. Maybe we 
were wrong, ma ybe we should have asked them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
18 
 
for some mo re help. I know somebo -- my cousin ju
st died a little whileago, she was in her 80™s. 
In -- just say we couldn™t get in, but don™t me ntion the name .  
Q: W- Wa s there a difference of opinion between your
 mother and father about whether or not it 
was really critical to le
ave quickly? Did they have the same  
viewpoint about leaving the country 
quickly? 

A: You me a n, they both agreed on it? 

Q: I™m asking, yeah, did they have -- 

A: Yeah, I didn™t quite follow that. 

Q: -- right [indecipherable] 

A: No, they agreed. 

Q: They agreed. 

A: If anything, my mother wa
s pushing my father. You see, she was younger and she realized 

that there wa s no more future. My father was re
luctant about how to support his family -- which 
he never did here, I mean, my sister and 
I supported it, ineffectively, but -- but we 
[indecipherable] that after lunch. And so -- but my
 mother said the time  has come  befor e  the 
Nove mber ™38, that we cannot stay. We™ve got to wo
rk on it, but it was very hard. We  tried to get 
to Bolivia, we tried to get to Panama , and 
nobody wanted anything, only C
uba -- again, a lot of 

money per person, was willing to take us in. 

Q: Do you reme mber anything about the race laws
 that came into being in 1935?  These would 
have been laws that would have prevented a -- 
a Jew from marrying a non-Jew, or th-those kinds 
of things?  Do you reme mber hearing about that? 

A: It was ™35? 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
19 
 
A: No. 
Q: Okay. 

A: I don™t reme mber mu ch about that, I was 14. I 
do reme mb er is the Reichstag [indecipherable]. 
That was in ™33, when they burned the [indeciphe
rable] the new Reichstag, and -- which was an 
absolute joke because the man whom they accuse
d of doing it was stupid, and he couldn™t ha ve 
done it with a ma tch, that™s the kind of thing you 
need all kinds of fla
mmables. The Hitl -- Hitler 
did it, but he -- 

Q: This was a book burning?  Which -- which burning was this? 

A: We ll, Reichstag. That™s where in -- now 
in Berlin they are building it up where the 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Oh, oh. 

A: And right after Hitler took ove
r, there was a fire. And I me a
n, this was a building like in 
Washington, you don™t -- one person doesn™t burn it 
down, and they didn™t have a bomb. It -- the 
one -- von Lupich was his name , he was addled. You could see. I mean, when he wa -- he 

couldn™t have lit the ma tch. And they did it fo
r propaganda, to show we
 have to fight the 
Commies, or whatever. Yes, I reme mber fr
om the beginning, but I was 12. You know it -- you 
don™t reme mber these things. 

Q: Do you have any me mories of book burnings in 1993? 

A: Not that I saw anything. I h
eard about thing, but I was muc h 
too busy with my own life. It 
was a sheltered life for me . My parents, of course
, were involved, but this is optimistic. Before -- 
I™m trying to think what I could still tell you of be
fore. And of course, my sister was four years 
younger, she knew even less. We  wer e  children, and we were being protected. What time is it? 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Can you tell us about Kristallnacht,
 that is in Nove mber ninth and 10
th
, 1938. 
A: Which year? 
Q: 1938, right? 

A: Yeah, ™38. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay, then we start with in November, pogrom. Th
at I can tell you a lot. It -- I reme mber that 
there was a news on the radio where some  Polis
h kid had shot some body a t  the German embassy 
in Paris, and that there wa s a big commotion. I 
had a bad cold and wasn™t going to school the 
next day. And I said, gee tomorrow they are all going 
to talk about it. When I come  back the next 
day nobody will talk any more. We ll, one time I wa
s wrong. Well, the nec -- the day after when I 
went to school a friend of mi ne ca me  running 
up the stairs, you can™t go to school, there™s a 
pogrom. It was not on the radio, but -- not yet. So
 I went back home , and one of my father™s 
sister was a widow. She lived in Breslau and she 
had visited her sister 
somewhere else. And my 
mother, as I said, she was a very forward looking 
person, has said to her sister-in-law, give me  
the keys to your apartme nt in case I have to 
hide my husband. So she a
nd Father went to that 
apartment. There was no man there so they 
wouldn™t be looking 
for anybody, and then my 
mother came back. Two friends of my father came
 over and said they were going to drive to the 
Sudetenland. This was right after Chamberlain 
had ma de the Munich arrangeme nt and given the 
Sudetenland to hit -- to Hitler. 
And these three men fi gured that the Nazi  or ganization wasn™t set 
up yet. It was just two or three 
weeks later, so that™s
 where they drove. It 
was about four hours, 
ma ybe, three hours from Breslau. And one of the me
n [indecipherable] a priest and asked him for 
asylum. The  priest said sure, you can -- anybody who 
is against Hitler can stay in my house. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
21 
 
the next morning he said, ﬁI am not a favorite 
of the Nazi, they ma y search here, I™m going to 
take you some where else.ﬂ He took the three me n 
to a nunnery. The nuns were very nice. Really. 
You know, honest people are nice, never mi nd what
 religion. My father 
and the two other me n 
were there for ma ybe four days. We re ve
ry comfortable, good food. And as -- it was 
entertainment for the nuns, too. Then they heard 
that the action was over a
nd they came  back to 
Breslau. Did you take the receiver off again?  
No. Because [indecipherable]. When they came 
back to Breslau they cont acted my mother to fi
nd out if it was safe to come home. My -- the me n 
were in the car from there, and my mother did 
so mething that she said was the hardest thing she 
ever did. When my father was gone a Gestapo 
man came, looked over the apartment, didn™t find 
my father, said, ﬁWell, when he come s back have him report.ﬂ So my mother took all the papers 

for e migration and said to my father, ﬁ We are going 
to the Gestapo to report.ﬂ She ma de sure that 
she went to the wrong room. And there there was 
a decent guy, he said, ﬁThe aktion is over, go 
home .ﬂ And my father said, ﬁMark the record, I 
have reported as required.ﬂ So when they came 
home, my parents told this nice maid to talk 
to all the neighbors in 
the whole block, that my 
father has been released fr om the Ges t apo. Ot
herwise some body would have asked -- would have 
said, for brownie points, you know, he is here, take
 him. So t his way, he got away from it. We  
also -- school was closed. I was in the Jewish 
school by that time . The windows of the Jewish 
stores were smashed. Pe ople were picked up if 
they looked Jewish and taken to concentration 
camps. So by that time we knew, never mi nd what
, we had to get out. Wh en school opened, all 
the teachers had been in the camp, and when th
ey came back, they were so thin, and so young 
looking because many of them had beards, and th
ey were shaven. We  didn™t recognize them. 
And one ma n whose father was also -- I mean, 
one boy in my class, his father was also a 
prominent lawyer, very impressive looking, was 
taken to a camp. And when the boy came  to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
22 
 
school he said, you know this morning I woke up, there was a bum in my  bedroom, a nd it was 
my father. He had just come  from the camp, he 
wanted me to see him like that. I mean, it was 
such a horrible thing. I knew one ma n was arrested
 in the street, and so was his son, but they 
didn™t know about it, they me t in the camp. Th
e s on had -- he came down with pneumonia, and 
the father wa s trying to help him as much as po
ssible. They told the fa
ther he can go home . And 
the father said, I would like to stay til my 
son is out of danger. If you don™t go now, you cannot 

get out. So he left, he had a wife and an -- tw
o daughter. And a week la
ter they brought him the 
ashes, they brought in a -- what they
 call these things, they™re -- urn. 
Q: Urn. 

A: So these stories you heard all over. 

Q: What was the name of the camp c l ose to
 Breslau that they 
were taking people -- 
A: I think it was Buchenwald, but
 it could have been any of 
the others, Sachsenhausen, there 
were quite a few of the m. And you didn™t know 
where they were. They couldn™t contact you. 
After awhile, especially thos
e who had a paper for emigration, were sent home . So the 
emigration offices, of course, and 
the quota were oversubscribed. At 
that time , at the end of ™38, 
it was very hard to get out. One thing was strang
e. Another sister of my
 father, also a widow, 
was at home  reading when the door was smashe d 
open, two SA me n came  in, heil Hitler, heil 
Hitler. Who are you?  And she stammered her name
. Pardon me ma™a m, excuse me, I™m so -- we 
are so sorry. Off they went. She couldn™t figure 
out what happened, but her name  was Arianne, 
and they thought she told them that she was Irish. So that was some  -- some thing funny, the only 

funny thing of the whole -- but in ma ny cases, afte
r the wa -- after that, the me n left Germany, 
and left their wifes and children behind, becau
se a ma n would have gone back to camp. The 

wome n wer e  not quite so in danger. 
So the -- the -- the Saint Louis -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
23 
 
Q: I-I™m just not clear on one thing. You describe
 that your father went away for several days 
and essentially hid, reported to 
the Ge stapo, but then you me ntione
d that your father did go away 
to camp?  

A: No, he didn™t. 

Q: No, he did not. 

A: No -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- because we ma de sure that -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- everybody knew the Gestapo didn™t want him, thank God. 

Q: C-Can you talk a little bit a
bout that atmosphere in the house
, those several days when your 
fat her was -- 

A: Scared, ve ry scared, because we didn™t know
 where he was. He couldn't telephone. I don™t 
know if they could tape phones at 
that time , but still and all, we had no idea. We  wer e  optimistic 
because, as I said, the Sudetenland was not integr
ated yet into Germany. But after he came back, 
and after the aktion was over, we never felt co
mfortable. Also, the smashed shop windows were 
not being repaired. The people eith
er didn™t have the money, or they were in the camp . I mean, 
what could you do, so you walked along the street
 with the boarded houses, the synagogue had 
been burned as I told you. And everybody was trying 
to get out. It was not yet that they had to 
wear the Jewish star, that came later. Also, it wa
s not yet where people c
ouldn™t sit on benches in 
parks. That was after I was gone. But you 
knew that things were comi ng, nobody knew how 
horrible, but still and all. So Cuba had aske
d I don™t know how much mo ney for visa. They 
thought they could ma ke it a good business, and 
people would wait there til the American quota 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
24 
 
came up. And we had an ship, the Saint Louis, which was a luxury ship. She was scheduled to 
cruise from New York to Bermuda a ll summer l
ong, back and forth. We ll the -- figure, if we get 
the 900 Jews on this ship, and -- it™s a free ri
de. So we got on, and it was a beautiful ship. 
Q: I wonder if you could just talk
 a little bit about 
the preparations to go, how did your parents 
hear about the -- the ship ride? 

A: We ll, first of all, my father was in touch w
ith the travel agent. Any 
ship in a port, you know. 
But -- so that™s how he knew. We  we re -- th-the
 scheduled ship was two weeks later. They had 
one in April and one later in J
une. Every month there was a regular
 ship, but this one left on the 
13
th
 of May, and the travel agent 
said, I can get you on it. The pr
eparations, you could not take 
your own things with you without getting pe rmi
ssion. Permission manager had to list everythi ng 
you had, and what you paid for it. So me  things 
my parents bought after they ma rried, you had to 
put an approximate a mount down, and pay the 
thing over again, as an exit visa. Whe n you 
packed, there were the Ge stapo in the house, with
 a list that you have 
sent, and watched what 
you took. And some  peoples tried to smuggle jewelry al
so. Well, that was the e
nd of it, if they s -
- if he saw it. We  did not. We  packed and th
at big, fat guy was standing there, but he wa s 
reasonable. I mean, he was not [i
ndecipherable]. And we put everyt
hing into a lift van that was 
on the Saint Louis. However, when we couldn't 
land, they shipped the lift back to Germany, and 
from England we wanted it out, it went to Ro
tterdam, it was bombed. That™s why I have no 
pictures. Everything was gone. 

Q: Can you tell us what you actually chose to put 
in there?  Your mother chose?  What -- what 
were your parents taking?  And you? 

A: You me a n reparation? 

Q: No, what items did you take?  Wh at items did 
you pack in the trunks to go on the Saint Louis? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
25 
 
A: Some  fur niture, I think. And some  -- I mean, wi
nter clothe s, because  we went to Havana, we 
didn™t expect to use them until we came  to theStates. So we had -- you see, people couldn™t take 
the money out, so they bought expensive clothe
s that would hopefully last for years with 
whatever money they had. My father had so muc h
 money that he were permitted to take, I don™t 
know, ma ybe five percent out of 
the country, which also went to
 Cuba. Cuba sent it back to 
Germany. What did we need it for?  We eventual
ly got it to England, but because it came  as 
German money to England, we coul
dn™t take it out when we came 
here. Then we left, right and 
left. I mean, it wasn't  only the Germans who were mean. The same  thing happened -- I mean, 

Cuba was horrible, too. And the English could have
 let us take our money out. That didn™t come  
until years later. 

Q: But wa -- were there things that your mother
 chose to take, hoping to be able to pass them 
down to you and your sister?  Family items? 

A: No, there were -- that™s th -- I mean, we 
just wanted to get out. 
And we did take -- we 
couldn™t take jewelry out, you had to hand that 
in. My mother did some thing because she was a 
chemist, and she dissolved gold into shoe paste 
and we had a nice round little shoe paste, which 
also was lost. And I used to say that some body 
may polish their shoes, they don™t shine. What 
doesn™t shine is gold. Who would know?  We ll, we 
tried, but it didn™t work out. My father put 
some  dia monds into a hammer. It™s gone. We  r
eally only came here with 40 dollars a person, and 
we were happy about it. But we are not here yet.
 So we got on the ship, and we didn™t know it, 
we thought we were away from Germany, but the ship was still German c ountry, I me an, you 

know, the nationality of the ship was the Germ
an. And the firema n, we found that out later, 
where the Ge stapo keeping track of not only the 
passengers, but of the crew. They were scared, 
too. They had been told to be polite, but no 
contact with the passengers. The captain was not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
26 
 
supposed to join the passengers, no captain™s tabl
e, or so. But we had a swimmi ng pool, the food 
was good, and we -- we thought we were all right. 

Q: Can I actually have  you just back up, because
 I would like you to tell 
me what it was like to 
travel from Breslau to Hambur
g. How did you get there, were th
ere any restrictions, were you 
aware of the Nazis?  

A: Yeah, and what happened was my father ha
d business to do with the ma n who wa s supposed 
to transfer our money in Berlin. So he and I left, 
while my mother and si st er st ill worked with the 
[indecipherable]. They were to co
me  to Hamburg couple of days la
ter. I know when we  went to 
Berlin, my father went in the 
dining room, and J e ws were not 
supposed to do that. I wouldn™t go 
with him. I was so scared. Nobody thought he was 
Jewish, as I told you, he didn't look it, he 
didn™t act it, but I was sitting in
 that stateroom, I couldn't wait fo
r him to c o me back. I thought it 
was mean of him to put me  through it, but he -- he
 was -- he was leaving. It could have me ssed it 
up completely. But we got to Berlin and he went 
to that banker, and one 
of my father™s brother 
lived there with his wife, and we went over to
 say good-bye. And a friend of mi ne I had gone to 
school with was in Berlin wa -- I told you, 
where you learn English and she wa -- became a 
correspondent in English, French and Spanish. She was very knowledgeable. So she came  by to 

say good-bye. I never saw her again. They wentto Bolivia and [indecipherable]. But -- so we 

spent the afternoon and when my fat her saw on th
e timetable that there was a train leaving for 
Ha mburg, he says, mi ght as well. That was f
unny. We  had two rooms, be cause my mother was 
comi ng, my sister was comi ng, and we walked 
around in Hamburg, I don™t know if you know it, 
very famous  red light district. But it was -- I m
ean, people were drunk there, it was more like a 
Coney Island. And I was walking with my fath
er, I was 18, and we were f -- a woma n came over 
to my father. And he laughed and he waved her off.
 How can she come  up here when I am there?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
27 
 
That was funny. So, he spent the night, the next mo
rning we went to meet my mother and sister, 
and we waited. We  were fo -- I™m trying to reme mber, I think we came over there on Monday, 
and the ship left  on Friday the 13
th
. So we were there -- there fo
r a night, with a Hamburg, and ni 
-- they have -- I don™t kn
ow if you have heard of that, the 
[indecipherable] canal, just like 
Lincoln tunnel. I don™t know from where it goes to
 where, but some  very nice guy walked us 
through and showed it to us. And I was so impre
ssed that you can walk un
der the water under the 
river. I had no idea that I was 
going to go to the [indecipherab
le] through the Lincoln tunnel 
every damn day for ma ny years. And another thin
g, my father wanted to give us a treat. And 
there was a Tierpark. That is 
not a zoo, but [indecipherable] for the wild animal. They caught 
them, kept them and sent them to where this ci
rcle zoo. And I hated it. It was smelling like all 
out. I have never gone to a zoo agai
n. But it™s still out there, butnot me . So then they said we 
should report on that, and there I 
can show you pictures, ma ybe we 
do that later. [indecipherable] 
get too interrupted. When we were up on the ga
ngway with 59 people [indecipherable] you know 
[indecipherable]. And we had the ro
om for the four of us. My parents had the lower berth and my 
sister and I, because there was no mo re room, it 
was full up, we were lucky we got on, very -- we 
didn™t know how luc -- lucky. And we were -- and we
 had a table for ourselves, the four of us, 

and Friday evening the band started to play
 -- you wouldn™t know -- you -- you don™t speak 
German, do you?  One of -- that was you play 
when you go, good-bye, and the ship pulled out. 
Q: What was the name  of the song? 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: The name of the song? 

A: I don™t know how to translate it. [speaks Ge
rman here]. Do I have to leave the city, you 
know?  We ll, some  people wanted to come  back, but 
not on our ship. It™s so 
-- it was very pretty, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
28 
 
and we had entertainment in the evening, everything was nice, and everybody was optimistic. 
One thing happened on the trip out. There was a ma
n overboard and the inte
rnational law is, if 
there is a ma n overboard, a ship has to stop fo
r two hours and search. He was a refugee from 
Russia, he worked in the kitchen as a dishwasher
, and he got so depresse
d he couldn™t take it any 
more. His brother was there too, and 
they had to put him into an is
olation cell for the rest of the 
trip, which was rather depressing, 
I mean, that -- where the refug
ees have [indecipherable] before 
in over two hours. But, was okay. We were schedul
ed to arrive in Havana on Monday, but the 
captain had heard that there coul d 
be problem. So he traveled as fast as he could, he fi gured once 

we are there, we are there. We  arrived on Saturday. 

Q: Before that, just a few things. A-A- As you boa
rded, what kinds of things were your parents 
saying?  Wh at was the -- th
e feeling of your parents 
about what you were doing? 
A: You me a n in -- on the tim
e on the ship of it -- no. 
Q: Just when you finally got on the ship, you 
had boarded, you were leaving Germany.  
A: Yeah, we were happy. We ll, I me an there wa
s laughing and we were -- there were a lot of 

people we knew, it was very social. The whole tw
o weeks were very social and cheerful, and I 
know I was very seasick in the Bay of Biscayne. 
I couldn't get out of my bed. But it was a very 

norma l, nice trip. Of course, they were worried. 

Q: Oh, you -- 

A: How -- how would we live? 

Q: Bu-But what was it like, the change from se
veral months before, Jewish shops were smashed, 
and people were being sent off to concentra
tion camp. And then you™re leaving Germany, and 
you™re on this really lo
vely ship. I mean -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
29 
 
A: It was a relief time . We t
hought we were out of it, which we were not. We  found t hat out. 
Well, we thought we were free to go. And 
there were ma ny people who have come  from 
concentration camps right on the ship. And they, of
 course, were happy. The trip out, you have to 
imagine like any other cruise now. The crew -- 
the crew was helpful. You got your bouillon, you 
got your this, you got your that. Suddenly you were 
the way it used to be 15 years before. When 
we came to Cuba on Saturday, they said it 
was weekend, we were too soon, they were not 
prepared to land that. We  believed it. Not very 
smart, but anyway. We  we re very near to the 
Havana, and you probably studied th
at, people who were in Havana 
already went on little boats 
that cruised around the Saint Louis. Sometimes
 it was a parent, husband, and the other one, 
they™re on the ship, they would 
holler up, we would holler down. And they would say, be calm, 
you™ll all get down, be calm. We didn™t -- we di
dn™t know what it meant. I mean, we wouldn™t 
fall down the gangway, would we?  But until Monda
y, we accepted the situation. When we didn™t 
get down on Monday, it -- we became suspicious. A
nd then the American Jewish Joint swang 
into action. They tried to bribe the Cuban govern
ment with, I think, I don™t remembe r  how much, 
2,000 dollars for each passenger, an awful lot of 
money. But there were two thing that were 
against the Cuban giving in. One was, there wa
s a quite a good connecti
on with the Nazi. There 
were a lot of them up in Cuba, and they thought
 of [indecipherable] down. Also the one who had 
signed our vi sa was in disgrace, for no part
icular reason, we took too muc h money, so did 
everybody else. So they were very stubborn about it.
 One day, [indecipherable] two of us sitting 
on deck when a ma n ca me running from the bath
room, his wrists slashed, bleeding all over, 
jumping overboard into the harbor. He was from 
Breslau, I knew him and the children very well. 
The harbor police fished him out. One of the sailor
s went after him to save him, whi c h really was 

tremendous. He went to Havana into the hospital. 
They would not allow his wife or children to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
30 
 
join him. They had to go back to England. We  lived near where we did, at the hospital when he 
was well, a month later came too. 

Q: Could you -- did you see that happen?  Li ke, can 
you tell us a little bit more of wha t  -- 
A: I was there, everybody saw it, of course. And 
he was a very upset ma n, I mean, he had a hard 
-- he was scared. He had been in the camp, and he
 wasn™t having any. So that was a pretty grim 
thing. The captain, who had been very aloof, been 
told to be aloof, invited the wife and children 
to have all their meals upstairs in hi s room
, because he wanted to prot ect them. You know, 
people would have been nice, 
but then you are worry. And -- 
Q: The wife of the ma n who jumped overboard? 

A: Th-The wife and the children. I mean, they c
ould have let the family go, couldn™t they?  That 
was [indecipherable] the next, the mean thing. So 
we were sitting there, and we were told -- I 
think that was the fi rst of June if I reme mber righ
t, that we had to go out of the three mile zone 
so we would be out of Cuban water, and then they
 could start negotiation. So that™s what we did. 
It was a beautiful day, the ship was standing ther
e, water, air, everything was very lovely. And 

we are waiting, and at night everybody woke up 
because the ship was running full steam ahead. 
And everybody thought they were in Europe al
ready, you know, we -- some thing was put over, 
we were sitting there in daytime and rushing wh
ere at night?  So the pa
ssenger -- I don™t know if 
riot is too much of a word, but they a
ll ran into the lounge, dema nded the captain. 
Q: In the mi ddle of the night? 

A: They dema nded to see the captain to find out what on earth was going on. Screaming, 

shouting, and I was so scared 
of -- the people, you know, they
 came down the stairs, up the 
stairs. We ll, you couldn™t blame the m. And the ca
ptain explained that there were negotiation 
between us and San Domi ngo, and another part 
of Cuba, and I don™t know what, and he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
31 
 
heading for a spot that wa s equidistant, so wh
en the solution came  we wouldn™t lose any more 
time. And di -- at that time the captain felt th
at about a half a dozen me n would be a liaison 
between the passenger and him. My father was 
one of them, so he was very busy. We  were 
cruising around, and came  very close to Miami, I 
reme mber the palm trees, it looked so pretty. 
But at that time Mia mi wasn™t what it™s now, th
at was much later. We  thought ma ybe we could 
get there, but the Coast Guard came with guns, so 
we left. And -- what I said to you before, some 
of the wome n, my mother signed 
a letter to Mr s. Roosevelt, 
whether she could help. Didn™t 
work. Understand that is in the Holocaust in 
Wa shington, ma y not be on display any more. So 
we were cruising around and there -- we got all 
kinds of telegrams, don™t worry, you™ll get off 
the -- eh -- and they -- forever 
they said you will not have to go back to Germany, that was the 
repeat all the time, which of course nobody believ
ed any mo re. But one interesting thing was the 
crew, who had been told not to be friends w
ith anybody, got very upset. Whenever there was a 
meeting there were two or three in
 the back to report to the othe
rs. And they said, what™s going 
on in Germa ny?  We  are on the ocean, we don™t k
now. One of the sailors got involve d with a 
Jewish girl. And the [indecipherabl
e] the Gestapo knew very well, so he killed hims elf. They 
found hi m hanging in his cabin. So they were r
eally taking their life 
in their hand to be 
sympathetic to us. And the -- the 
captain told my father, I don™t
 know if other people knew it -- 
later on I read it in books. He said, if we have to
 go into the English chan
nel without a chance to 
go anywhere but Germany, he would [indecipherable]
 the ship at the coas
t o -- coast of England, 
and then we would be shipwrecked and they would have
 to take us in, and to hell with the ship. It 
was some thing. I mean, that man was unbeliev
able. Luckily, by the time  we got into the 
channel, the Jewish Joint had convinced Engl
and, Belgium, Fr ance and Holland to take in 200-
some  people. We  landed in Amsterdam -- not lan
d, I mean we berth -- berthed in a -- and Mr. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
32 
 
Tropper -- and his name  should be honored. He 
had -- was the one who really did everything 
from the Jewish Joint. He came up with representa
tives of the four countri
es, and one of the little 
girls came and said she was sorry 
she couldn™t give him flowers, 
but she thanked him for ret -- 
saving all our lives. That woma n, as
 a ma tter of fact, is quite ac
tive in talking about the Saint 
Louis. So when they ma de up lists, my sister 
and I helped, for the passengers who traveled 
together, but didn™t have the same  name , like 
a couple with a mother-in-law, because they 
shouldn™t be split up. The four countries had certa
in requests. I know Holland wanted single men 
because they had [indecipherabl e] c
ould take care it better there, 
and they expected a war. They 
could have a few more s oldiers. I don™t know 
what Belgium wanted, France. The lucky ones 
were England because a year later Hitler had r
un over the ot he r countries, and ma ny of the Saint 
Louis people were killed. And we -- he -- some th
ing funny happened, we -- our first and -- was it 
Antwerp?  I™m not sure, we didn™t 
get off there. And there was a bi
g ship in the ba
ck of us, going 
to Chile, and some body called my na me . Was a gi
rl from my school, she was on her way to 
Chile I was comi ng back from Cuba , and a -- a 
-- you know, these little things are so -- they 
illumi nate how crazy everythi ng was. Then they announced on the intercom certain names that 
were going to Holland. Belgium first, and then the 
others went to Holland. They were -- they™re 
only half of it. And we, who went to England 
and France, we are put on a freighter, to -- 
Q: Now before we go that, I want
 to go back over a few si -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- some  things about the -- the trip. Can you 
tell us more about what people were saying on 
the ship as they began to real
ize that you wouldn™t get into Cuba
?  This is when you™re still in 
Cuba. What were people talking about? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
33 
 
A: We ll, people -- I really shoul
d have gone into that. People 
were planning to go overboard. 
And they hope that the young people could swim fo
r two hours, and if they couldn™t, the next 
one would go, to save the life of the other. Th
at™s why the captain of the committee had a -- a 
watch on deck at night. Nobody was allowed out 
any more, s o me  levelheaded people. You must 
reme mber that there were some  people on the ship
 with the shaven head, directly from the camp. 
They were not taking any chances to go to Germany, 
they™d rather drown. If in -- last fe w days -- 
well, if what I think about, we 
left June first, we landed, I thin
k, on June 19. There aren™t this -- 
must have been about two weeks th
at -- the last week was really 
terrible. You just didn™t kn -- 
and you were so helpless, what could you do?  We  
have telegrams, and all up the [indecipherable] 
wasn™t. Nobody believed it any more. And -- 

Q: What was -- what was your 
father saying at that point? 
A: My father didn't talk about it. He was with 
the captain, and I mean, these me n did only public 
announceme nt. What he said to my mother, I 
don™t know. But they were not going to spread 
rumor one way or another. They had bulletins, an
d that was that. I mean, probably the way it was 
when the Cuban mi ssile was here with Kennedy, they
 didn™t talk about it. They did what they 
could. So -- but I don™t know one thing, when we 
landed in England my father came down with 
pneumonia because so ma ny days a nd nights he
 had been working. He was completely 
exhausted. He had been with the captain, he 
had been with the othe
r committee me mber, and 
trying to do what they could. 

Q: What -- did your parents have any plan for 
-- for you, if -- if you were going to have to go 
back to Germany?  Did your mother talk about it at all? 

A: No. It was impossible to think to go back 
to Germany, because what probably would have 
been happening, we would have taken off the ship 
into a camp, and be killed. I don™t know if my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
34 
 
mother still had cyanamid -- cyanamid -- cyanide 
in her pocket, that ™s quite possible that she 
would have given us a lemonade 
and we would have dropped dead. 
Q: A-At this point did you know 
wha t  was going on in the camps? 
A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: You did. 

A: We  had -- we didn™t know ev -- the crematoriu
ms were not yet, but people died whether -- 
right and left . They were beaten, they were 
shot, they were God knows what. That much we 
knew, not the full extent . That came much late
r. But we knew it was a death sentence. Comi ng 
back to Germany was inconceivable. And of course
 the -- that™s why the -- why had that -- where 
I spoke the cruelty of the other countries. I m
ean, what 900 people. They could have been saved, 
and they were, but wa -- some  people -- some  of
 the Saint Louis people 
are very bitter, even 
now. I am not, mostly because I was lucky to ge
t out. But I know that Roosevelt was under great 
pressure. He could not go ahead and do it, it wa
s the depression. So [ind
ecipherable] he ma naged 
to defeat Hitler. If he had been
 -- this was ™39, if he had been
 defeated in 1940, you know what -- 
oh, that new book, that [indecipherable] -- you™ve 
heard of the book now, yeah?  That we should 
have let Hitler go ahead and we would have b
een very happy here. So that feeling was much 
stronger then. 

Q: But when you were outside of Miami, and yo
u could see Miami, what were your feelings 
about the United States as a young woma n?  

A: I don™t think I thought much a
bout it. I said, I wish they w
ould let us in, but nobody else did 
either. You know, there wasn™t a mu ch of a diffe
rence between all the co
untry, I just hoped we 
would get some where. I wasn™t part
icularly interested in going to America. I was interesting to 
staying alive. And eventually then I kne
w my number would be up, the quota -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
35 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: -- if I ma naged to survive it. 

Q: You talk about being interest
ed in staying alive, I mean, do 
you reme mber feeling that your l -
- that  this really was a life
 or death s -- death issue?   

A: I knew that. I just couldn™t believe it. You kne
w the same  thing when we were in England and 
the bombs came down. You -- you just -- your whole 
concept -- I think soldiers in wa r time  too, 
they are afraid, but they just -- oh, excuse me . 
The enormity does not hi
t you until after. I don™t 
know if you™ve ever been in any danger, you do 
what you have to do and then afterwards you 
collapse. Then it hits you how 
close you were to catastrophe. A
nd that™s the way it was on the 
ship. I reme mber I annoyed some  pe ople. I said ve
ry innocently, I dreame d last night that we had 

the Christmas party on board. And that was in
 June. Nobody liked my smart [indecipherable] 
remark, but I didn™t even think. But I was still ab
out 18 -- yeah, 18 in ™39. So -- so there we were 
on a little freighter, we were about
 400 people still, and the Saint 
Louis took off for America, for 
the cruises. And the crew lined up on dec
k, and said good luck to the Jews, which was 
some thing. And they told us, we are so glad we 
don™t have to go back to
 Ha mburg, we are going 
to New York and we cruise to Bermuda, and in the fall when we come  back to Germany, 

everythi ng will be forgotten. Been not forgotten in 60 year. 

Q: Ha -- ha -- ha -- what wa -- they we re sort of
 shouting to you?  The crew
 me mbers were sort of 
shouting to you good-bye? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: A-A-And th -- was it in German?  

A: In Germa n, [indecipherable] in Juden. It wa
s them saying -- I mean, they really were in 
danger, those sailors, and so -- 
but they got so involve
d in that, what was a -- well, we were on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
36 
 
the ship for six weeks, but the commotion was fo
r three. And if you keep
 hearing it and hearing 
it, how frightened people are of Germany, you w
onder what country is that. Maybe that™s the 
way the black people felt in the south. You know
, when -- when they was no -- no help. You are 
trapped, especially on a ship. A
nd also there was a question about food, and [indecipherable]. 
The food wa s sufficient, but the last fe w days 
they didn™t give us so ma ny choices. In the 
beginning it was a first class ship, 
you could choose from six entrees. In the end you had either 
fish or meat. It was enough, but no waste.  
Q: Did you get to know any crew me mbers?
 Can you talk a lit
tle bit about that? 
A: I had no personal relection with
 the -- personal connection with them. They
 were pleasant, but 
I kept away from the m, I was afra
id of them. By the time I realized that  they really were very 
helpful, we were gone. So then we went on a fr
eighter first to France, where 250 people got off, 
and the freighter had very few cabins. Most of all 
that in where the freight used to be, there were 
bunk beds maybe three, four high, you had to c
limb up. And you could just roll out of bed and 
have breakfa st because the tables were there, t
oo. A few cabins were reserved for my parents and 
the other me n from the committee. I feel apprec
iation for they had done. But the rest of what 
there was, one freight roo m for men,  and one 
for wo men. Yo u had to climb down th e ladder to 
get in, and we were me an. When you sit downstairs and people come  down the ladder, you see 

their legs first. And we had bets up to the kn
ee, what legs are comi ng down, except one woma n, 
she had ankles like that. No bets on her. You 
know, and we -- with all the commotion, we kids 
had some fun. Never -- as a matter of fact on the 
ship I was walking around with one guy, he was 
very friendly. And I was friends with another 
guy. And one day when I was walking with one on 
deck, the other one came and said hello. And it tu
rns out they were brothers. I didn™t know that. 
There I was flirting with tw
o, and it was all very nice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
37 
 
Q: C-Can you tell us a little 
bit more about the captain? 
A: The cap -- 
Q: O -- of -- of the Saint Loui
s. This is Gustav Schroeder. 
A: We ll, the captain was -- let me  start with 
the end. After the war he was called for the 
Nuremberg Trial, and my father then [indeciphe
rable] this ma n wasn™t a Nazi, he saved a 
thousand people. And he was acquitted. My father
 and he correspond until my father died, and 

the captain died soon afterward. He was a poet. He  had a son in Ha mburg who was -- I think he 

had infantile paralysis. And he was very fond of 
his son and whenever the ship came in or out, he 
would play -- the band would play the son™s favori
te song, I don™t reme mber which it was. So he 
was unbelievable with what he did.
 And he -- of course the highe
r people, the Gestapo had him -- 
tried to intimi date him, but he was -- but you sa
y, how did he learn how to stand up for thing? It 
was a decent, honest person. I don™t know what 
religion it [indecipherable] and I don™t care. 
There are people that are -- it shows you the pict
ure in the book, a little 
book that he wrote in 
German and sent to my father. He went back to Ne w York then, with the ship.  

Q: Wh- Wha t did he do?  You talked about -- can 
you tell us some  about what -- what was so 
special about him, what did he do? 

A: He saved us. I mean, when they told him to 
go back, he didn™t. He knew it would cost him his 
whatever they call the stuff that the captains 
have. He knew he would be cashiered. He wasn™t 
because he ha d to go back to New York. He just
 didn™t obey order. And we didn™t know all the 
things he did, we just knew 
we -- he helped us survive. 
Q: S-So, during the time when it was unclear wh
at was going to happen to the passengers, he 
disobeyed orders to go back to Germany? 

A: The oren -- he only wa s going to [i ndecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
38 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: We knew it meant Germany unless somebody el
se [indecipherable] us before. He doodled 
and dawdled around, he stalled everything. And as I 
said, he wa s prepared to [indecipherable] the 
ship so we would not have to land in Germany. A
nd that is just as much as any captain can do f-
for his ship, and for his passenger. He said to my 
father he was scared sti
ff, and my father said, 
me , too. But  this wasn™t necessary. 

Q: What else did your father say 
about him when he met with him?  
A: He didn™t talk about it. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I mean, you know, as a lawyer, he was used to 
keeping secrets. He ma y have told my mother, 
but he sure wasn™t going to tell 
his blabber daughters. He wouldn™t 
take the chance. But he talked 
to her a real  
-- I don™t know. 
Q: C-Can you just describe what the scene was 
like on the ship?  When it 
was clear you actually 
had turned around towards your -- I mean, what 
did it look like, what were people doing? 
A: That -- that was at night when 
it™s -- we didn™t see it, we just 
felt it. And that was, if anything, 
even worse. I reme mber they dema nded that the 
ship turn around because they were afraid the 
passengers were going to Europe. So the ship turn
ed and turned and turned. And we could see by 
the sun that it was a full turn. So we were being 
cheated. And that™s when they really sc reamed. 
Oh, it was a -- a riot. But the captain calmed them
 down, convinced them that he was on our side, 
which was the greatest thing he could do. But th
at of course, was right in the books for the 
Gestapo.  

Q: The spies would have been writing that, yeah. 

A: They kept track of everything.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
39 
 
Q: But what kinds of things were people sayi
ng, once it really sunk in 
that you were going back? 
A: What could they sa
y?  We don™t want to. 
Q: Right. 

A: You see, you don™t know -- I don™t want to cr
iticize your question, but 
you have no idea how -
- what do you think people said in the death 
camps?  They couldn™t say anything. You were just 
living from mi nute to mi nute. They would sa
y there is a new noti
ce on the bulletin, everybody 
would run and look at it and not be
lieve it. They would say -- I 
don™t think it™s [i
ndecipherable]. 
We were supposed to go -- it was at San Domi ng
o, I -- there was the -- they
 said ma ybe if they 
go to a different harbor in hav -- in Cuba, th
ey will let us get into the dec -- back door. 
[indecipherable] But everybody said, oh I don™t believe
 it. And especially people who have small 
children, they were very fright
ened. I mean, everybody was. So th
at was that part. When we 
came to England, and as I said, we were the lu
cky one, because the ot her -- by July ‚40, Hitler 

had run over the whole thing.  
Q: Di-Did your parents choose Engla
nd, or -- or was that just luck? 
A: No, no, as I said, each country had requi
reme nt. My father was working with the 
representative, and I know the Be
lgian representative wanted us to come  to Belgium, but my 
father said no. He had a choice, because he wa
s [indecipherable] he said, with the war comi ng, 
we go to England. He knew what he was doing. As a 
ma tter of fact, I didn™t know it at that time, 
but my brother-in-law™s parents we
re also on the Saint Louis, and 
they went to Belgium. They 
were underground for four years, living in a litt
le room -- in a little room what faced the 
cemetery so nobody saw the window. People brought them
 food, and from ™40 to ™46 or ™45, they 
lived underground. Their son was here already, he 
was in the army, and the -- in ™46 they me t 
again here, and he me t my sister, 
I think two months later ma rried.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Can -- going back a little bit 
to the Saint Louis, you had me n
tioned that you were afraid of 
some  of the crew me mb ers. Did you have any 
-- any bad experiences with them, overhearing 
them say anything, or treating you 
or others in a certain way? 
A: Not that I reme mber. I ma y not 
have been involved with it.  
Q: Did you hear about anything like that? 

A: Not at the time. Afterwards 
I learned a lot of thing, but at
 the time you just went along.  
Q: Did you know the young girl who dated the crew
 me mber, who fell in love with the crew 
me mb e r ?  

A: I can™t say, no.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, the whole thing is like a blur. You lived one day and you wondered, as I said. You 

lived for the bulletin, and you hope th-that what
 anybody said didn™t mean anything. You just 
didn™t believe it. I know that the 
bulletins were in English and in 
German because my father say 
people mi sunderstand the English one, they
 don™t know enough. Now there was one bulletin, 
there is still hope it -- to 
land in Europe. That still was not a ne
gative. So my father translated it 
to there is hope to la -- I mean, in German w
ithout [indecipherable] you know, with the flavor of 
this [indecipherable] because they looked like eh -- 
so that wa s -- that was all we di d, watch what 

every -- we got telegrams ma ybe three, four tim
es a day from Europe Jewish community, from 
American community. They collected an awful lot 
of money, which they had been prepared to 
give to Cuba. And what nobody could understand, w
hy the Cuban didn™t just take it. but it was a 

matter of principle. I think they were afraid of th
e Nazis, of the Hitler people ther e, because there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
42 
 
was a very large underground in Cuba. And they were
 afraid if they disp
leased them, it would 
topple their governme nt. You know 
how governme nts get toppled.  
Q: Going forward now, we™ve looke
d at -- at some of this mate
rial, but that you -- you and your 
family are headed towards England. 
A: Into what? 

Q: Towards Britain, towa rds England. You got b
ack to Europe and then you were selected, 
essentially, to go to England. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So -- and you began to tell me  about that sh 
-- that -- that ride to England. Wh- What was it 
like when you docked there, and where did you dock? 

A: We ll, when we got to England, we had no chan
ce to do anything, they did for us. There was -- 
they called it the Rowan house, that took care of ref
ugee, they ar -- are -- it
™s when we got off the 
ship we were given a number by one of the -- I gu
ess, social worker. She said, this is the number 
of your train car, and this is the number of the 
bus that will meet you in London. So that™s what 
we did, and the bus took us to a little pens
ion, you know a little hotel, mo stly students were 
there, and we had a room arranged for by th
e Rowan house for one w
eek. And my father 
[indecipherable] got sick. My mother asked if we
 could stay longer, they said no. They probably 
thought we were just telling them
. I n the meantime we found out th
at my uncle from Breslau had 
arrived in London, and we found out where he was.
 And we went -- he was in what you call a 
brownstone, I don™t know what they have in Wa
shington, here in New York they have the 
refurnished brownstone houses, and the -- the room
s are rented out to people, each room -- not 
apartment. And he and his wife and son had one 
room, and here -- the landlady gave my parents 
a room, but she had no other space, she said she w
ould in two weeks, and my sister and I were in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
43 
 
another building that belonged to her, under the r
oof. It was slanted attic 
and there we were, and 
what impressed me  was, in Havana, where in da
ylight, it was pitch dark and in 15 mi nutes was 
bright sunshine. That was near the equator. 
In England, dawn and dusk were [indecipherable] 
especially during the war when they had daylig
ht saving, you could read 
at 11 o™clock. I like 
that. So there we were in England, and after a mo nth, I got a job doing millinery work. I put 
labels into the hat, by appointme nt to her ma jest
y the queen. I™m sure she never wore my hat. I 
wasn™t very good at it. And then came the war, 
Se ptember ™39 [indecipherable] arrived in June. 
[indecipherable]. By August we knew. I went sightse
eing on Saturday after work, but most of the 
things were buried already for 
safekeeping. Children were ta
ken away from London. Things 
were getting ready, but not as ready as they s
hould have. Whe n the war started, I was working in 

that millinery, and one of the girls said, did you 
know that trouble had st arted?  And I sa id, 
trouble, does that mean war?  She says, yes. So in
 those let -- last few days the ambassadors went 
back and forth, but then it was war. They cal
led it the blitzkrieg, they thought the Germans 
would come  like this, which didn™t happen, and th
ey ma de fun of it and called it the sitzkrieg, 
they were sitting. But by April -- my factory ki
cked me  out, they weren™t busy any mo re and me  
he could do without. And in the spring, of cour
se, Hitler ran over Belgium and everyt hing. And 
at that time , the English were 
afraid that among the refugees 
there would be Nazis hiding as 
refugee, and all -- most of the me n were put in
to camps, my father, and everybody. So he was -- I 
think it was the Isle of Mann where he was, from
 June, July, August, September, three month. In 
the meantime the blitz had started. Every night th
e bombs ca me  down when it got dark until it 
got daylight. And of course as 
the la -- nights got longer, the 
bombs went. We -- I know we were 
-- one time  we were standing in the baseme nt, 
sitting there, and the house was shaking, and I was 
thinking, I hope the ceiling will st
ay up. If the ceiling stays up we™
ll be alright. Then, after the all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
44 
 
clear, you went around looking what houses weren™
t there. And my father came back in 
September, and he ma na ged to get passage for us to come  to the State, which was very hard to 
get. I mean, the ships were being sunk, and they n
eeded ships. So we went to Liverpool and went 
on board. Blackout. You couldn™t go on deck with
 [indecipherable] doors, because you know, 
you couldn™t even smoke  on deck because a light car
ries very far in the ocean. We  had air raid 
alarms. Mostly they were just 
tests, but some times you could hear
 planes, and you didn™t really 
know where, what. So we went -- I think it took 
about more than two weeks. There were three 
groups of people on the ship. Children with their mo
thers or their nannies, that came  to Canada 
for safekeeping. And some  refugees, and a w
hole batch of young me n wh
o just came  on board. 
No paper, no nothing. Well, what 
we find out, we were full -- I 
think two full crews for ships, 
which Roosevelt had promised Chur
chill cash and carry. They pick
ed up the ships in New York 
and take them back to England. So, I reme mb
er one thing, everything was blackout and no -- no 
identification. And whe n we were near Halifax, 
there was a fog and an old English man said, 
well, when the king and queen came to Halifax, th
ey were befogged too, so it™s all right. And I 

was standing on deck with some  guy and we sa
w the captain come  out. We hadn™t seen him 
before, because I mean, it was a heck of a job ge
tting the ship over. And he was looking up and 
saluting, and we saw it was the Union Jack wave, 
and that meant we were in Canadian waters, 
and we™d done it. Now that mo me nt I will ne ver forget, because on that ship, you 

[indecipherable] you never got undressed. You had 
your lifebelt, you had your
 winter coat, and 
your boots. You had to have the wint
er coat in case you went into 
a boat. You had to be able to 
throw it off in case you went into the water. Same  
thing with the shoes. I mean, that was another 
scary ride. I didn™t take a cruise 
until years later. But we were in
 Halifax, we -- they took on foo -
- food, and oil. And then we sailed down to New Yo
rk. I didn™t see the Stat
ue of Liberty. We  had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
45 
 
to be showing our papers downstairs, and when 
we got off, there was a ma n from the HIAS. I 
don™t know if you know t hat [indecipherable] on Esther
 Place, I think it™s s
till there. They would 
take newcomers in who had nobody to meet them. Mo
st of them had some  relatives, we didn™t. 
So he took us down to the HIAS, and that was rea
lly scary, I was scared. We were sitting there, 
they told us to wait. It was 
it -- two days before Thanksgiving
. And the two me n came  over from 
Vienna. And my parent -- my si
ster and one of the guys went out
 one door for a little walk, and I 
went out another door with that guy who was ve
ry scruvy looking. Unshaven. He walked me  
around and around. I said, I want to go back. He 
wanted to sh -- he wanted to show me 
some thing. I was say, gee whiz, I can™t even tellthe cops where I am. I didn™t have an address, 

what was going on?  But he wanted to show me
 Woolworth. In those days, for one dollar, you 
could buy candies, and stocking, and stationer
y, everything was a dime  or 15 cents. I wa s 

overwhelmed. Then he took me  back. But it -- it™s 
very uncomfortable. So we were in the -- that 
was Tuesday we arrived, We dnesday we went
 down to Time s Square where the Jewish 
organizations were. I was very disappointed. Time
s Square in daylight was very scruffy, even 
then. And the woma n who took our pa rticulars sa
id we should come  back on Monday because 
tomorrow is Thanksgiving, we won™t work, and 
Friday we don™t work. What was Thanksgiving, 
we didn™t know. So she gave an -- an appointme nt
 for Monday. And I -- my sister and I, we went 
back to the HIAS, and my parents went to 
see that cousin, and 
-- who invited us for 
Thanksgiving dinner next day. Ther
e were all kinds of fa mily th
ere, a big to-do. I don™t know if 
you know -- your -- ﬁLife With Fath
erﬂ?  You don™t know the play?  That was new at the time. A 
whole string of redheads, Irish. And when we 
came in, they said, the Irish fam -- ﬁLife With 

Fatherﬂ. We  didn™t know what it was all about. So 
we me t a cousin of mi ne and he took us out, 
and he said he had a friend who was in the empl
oyme nt agency of the [indecipherable] and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
46 
 
should go there, and sheintroduced us, we had coffee with her, and she said we should come  on 
Monday and see if we could get a job. And we 
did. So we we re there on Tuesday, on Monday we 
had a job. It was a -- two Viennese men were
 ma king gloves for the Army  and Navy. And my 
sister  sat on a little machine and made all those 
fingers. You had to ma ke, I think 10 dozen pairs. 
You didn™t be lieve  it. It was piecework. And we 
were still in the HIAS because we -- everybody 
told us to leave New York. They said it would 
be better in a small 
town, a small community 
would take care of us. My sister and I, we sat 
there and my sister, she was a tough noodle, she sat 
next to the fastest person and ma tched. She b
ecame  the fastest one in the group. I wasn™t bad, 

either. So in those days, the mi ni mu m was 10 dol
lars a week. And she and I each ma de 18. That 
was a lot. And my -- we took work home for my 
mother to finish. We  came home wi th big bags 
of gloves, and she finished it and we took them 
back. I mean, she didn't work all night, it™s the 
next day. And so she earned some  money. My 
father had all kinds of funny jobs in the 
beginning. He was working for a de
ntal lab, delivering the false t
eeth. That™s for the lawyer. But 
he was really terrific, he did whatever came,
 and after awhile he got a job as a bookkeeper, 
where he stayed the rest of the time. So be
tween 18 and 18 and ma ybe my mother eight, my 
father ma ybe 12, that was, in those time , livab
le. But of course, we bought yesterday™s bread, 
was cheaper. I went to my first movie after one year, on my birthday some body took me. A date 

was an ice cream soda with two straws. I mea
n, it took doing. And at first I could not go to 
school because I was war work, so you had to 
work long hours. And once they did -- some body 
told the Army and Navy, knitted gloves are no good, 
they wanted a -- what we ma de were liv -- 
knitted gloves with leather palm. 
But they wanted leather gloves with lining. All the soldiers in 
the ar -- [indecipherable] said our
s are better, we have a better 
grip. But, governme nt. So we 
didn't have governme nt work any more, we ma de gl
oves for skiing, and that gave me  a chance to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
47 
 
go to school. And I went -- I don™t
 know if you know it, on Lexington Ave. in [indecipherable] is 
part of City College, the Brandeis Institute, that™s
 for business. I didn™t take credit, but I lear ned. 
You know, auditor. And when I t
hought I was ready, I started in an office, very much at the 
bottom. I worked my way up, and my sister got ma
rried, and my father di
ed in ™56. He died on 
the last day when he retired, he didn™t come  
home any more. He collapsed in the subway. We  
didn™t know where he was. But eventually I co 
-- went to the police 
and declared him mi ssing, 
and they found him in the Roosevelt hospital, he 
died the next day. That™s where that doctor was 
who thought he was a Nazi. So that™s how it went. 
Q: Why did that doctor think your father was a Nazi? 

A: The doctor? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He thought Father was a Nazi because he didn
™t look Jewish, we -- we had an accent, he had 
those student -- what they call a smisser, 
I don™t know if ther
e is such a word. 
Q: Scars?  

A: Scars, from sabers, you know, fenc -- much --  

Q: Fencing. 

A: I don™t know what -- if they do 
it even here, not any more. Not in
 the -- not for fraternity. It 
was like an -- being in -- before you joined it
, not hazing, it was more
 a courage thing. Maybe 
you could even call it hazing. So they thought he wa
s a German Nazi. And then he was so nice. 
When he found out that we were
 Jewish, you know, he was -- this 
was shortly after the war, and 
ma ybe he ha d fa mily in Germany, you know, and he didn™t fee -- he was a good doctor, but he 

had no warmth, and it was so funny how suddenly he was helpful, and -- you know, there™s a 

difference between being correct, and being nice.
 So then my  mother and I, we moved down 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
48 
 
here, because she had a heart condition at 
Wa shington Heights -- 
I don™t know if you know 
[indecipherable] Heights -- it was hard for her to
 walk. And my sister, she got engaged the day 
she me t her husband, and they got ma rried six week
s later. And all that about a month after her 
pa -- his parents came. I don™t know if his parent
s were very happy that he suddenly had a bride 
and a baby a year later. He was a chemist. 
Q: Can I get you to talk some  about faith?  Over
, for instance, the period when your family was 
on the Saint Louis. We re
 you going to services? 
A: Yeah [indecipherable] 

Q: And wha t  kind of prayers was your
 father praying with you, and -- 

A: It was a com -- I mean, the -- in the lounge th
ere were prayer, for Friday night and Saturday. 
Not specifi cally only for the Saint Louis, but I 
mean, we were there on the Jewish holiday, right, 
Shavuot, in May that would have been. So they ha
d their routine prayers, 
but not particular one. 
And you know, that remi nds me  of s o me thing else 
which really doesn™t belong in here. When I 
was on a cruise to Alaska, they had Friday ni
ght service conducted by a priest. Wa s he ever 

careful. He was a lovely guy. It was the Fourth 
of July, which ma de it easy for him t o preach, 
because Four th of July is no religion. And one 
ma n who was knowledgeable Jewish, he said the 
Jewish prayer. He knew -- the priest also kne
w some  Hebrew. It was quite an experience, 
because he conducted masses every day for the 
Catholic people on board. So, it was nice  
Q: What -- when you look back at -- at the time,
 what do you think enabled your fami ly to stay 

together that was unusual in that time ?  What wasit that enabled your mother
 and father to keep 

going on and keep fi
nding solutions?   
A: I don™t think it was religion th
at kept my fathe r  and mother on. They were Jewish, and 
conscious Jews, but I don™t think, 
at least I never reme mber that 
we had a prayer meeting. There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
49 
 
ma y have be en Orthodox people on board who had 
their meetings in their cabin, but we were 
me dium religious, even when we we re here. I m
ean, I now am what they call every day Jew, for 
the three holidays, I™m a me mber 
of the synagogue, but I don™t go of
ten. If I had children I think 
I would have been more conscientious about te
aching. But we were not 
that religious. There 
were ma ny people who didn™t even know they were 
Jewish until Hitler told them. They were so 
assimilated that it was a great 
shock for them. It was not for us, we knew we were Jewish. But I 
know -- I have one friend, she and her husband ca
me  from fa mily who, a s I said, they never 
knew they were Jewish until they got kicked out. 
They had a little son. When he was 12, he was 
wanted to be Bar Mitzvah. And they thought he wa
nted the party, he -- but he wanted, so for a 
whole year he had his dad take him to classes, 
and then there was a Bar Mitzvah with a lot of 
people who™d never been in a temple [indeciphe
rable] and that little
 guy got it. You know, 
religion is a very changeable thing. I™ve seen 
people who were not religious, and their children 
ma rried very religious, and the other way aroun
d. It -- I don™t know how religious you are, 
whether you are an organized religion that ma ke
s you do certain things certain days. And I know, 
for instance, the Orthodox Jewish religion -- a
nd there were these Ort
hodox Jews on the ship, 
they have to do things that way, 
whether it™s kosher, whether it™s
 Shabbat, it™s a very -- I don™t 
want to say constricting, because the people w
ho do it don™t feel it™s c
onstricting. I do. You know 
they -- their whole life is built ar
ound it. My family and I never were. My nephew is married to a 
non-Jewish girl who is very l
ovely. She knows more than he doe
s by now. So i -- I always feel 
everybody should ma rry everybody else so th
ey can™t get ma d at each other. 
Q: H-H-How -- if it was not religion then, what
 do you think gave your mo
ther and father the 
strength to keep going on, and to
 keep pushing the fa mily overseas? 
A: The necessity, we didn't  have a choice.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
50 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I mean, what could they have done?  And 
my  grandmother stayed in Germany, there was 
nothing she -- they could do. My mot her always fe
lt very bad, but she sa
id she had -- she owed 
more to her husband and two young children. It™s -- 
they provided for her and there was that -- 
that nice lady was there, but if they had been 
very religious they woul
d have taken her along, and 
we would all have gone into trauma . Relig
ion was not -- you will f -- you know, ma ny people 
became very religious once they were in the camp . And I always feared the -- it™s a pr ayer that 

they say in me mory of t hose who died, and I always
 think that ma  -- prayer is wrong. It says for 
those who died as ma rtyrs for being Jewish. I 
feel it™s much sadder those who died who never 
knew they were Jewish, who really were just
 told, you are Jewish and you drop dead. The ones 
who were Jewish and religious as you say, probabl
y had an easier time. Th-That™s what I think, I 
ma y be wrong. Gee, I feel like on a Freudian couch. 
But it™s interesting to 
think about things that 
you usually don™t. 
Q: Have you ever gone back to Breslau? 
A: Over my dead body. I once was in Germany for 
two days, I couldn™t breathe. It was -- now it 
would be different because a different  generation.
 When I was there, I was very tense. I knew I 
couldn™t blame everybody. And one ma n I know my 
age went to Breslau and he gave a long 
report on it. I could hardly read it. It turn
s my stomach. When I was in Germany, the young 
people didn™t care anyway, and the old people sa
id how come  you speak German so well. I was 
with a tour  from here. And of course they figured it out because I spoke German well, and I 

didn™t know what a ma rk looked like, you know, th
e German money. And one day we were in 
Heidelberg. Have you been there?  And in Heidel berg we were not allowed to have our tour 

guide, but a local woma n to show us around. And 
she of course had my number. And she was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0402  
51 
 
my age, and I knew she must have been a young N
azi because at that age, she was 13, I mean, 
she didn™t have a choice. She came over to me
, she asked me  how I was doing, what I was going, 
how I had lived in Amer ica. It was very nice . And I don™t know if you™
ve heard of it, in 
Heidelberg, that™s where the students are. They
 have an enormous -- a beer keg, and they open 
the keg and everybody gets a glass. And she calls
 me  to open the keg. [indecipherable]. And I 
was thinking, gee whiz, I don™t know what she 
did when she was 18. People are people, all 
kinds. But I was glad when I was out of the c
ountry. The older ones looked at me -- not this 
woma n, but others, suspicious. I don
™t think they liked me  to come  back. But it was part of the 
tour or I wouldn™t have gone. 

Q: Did your fa mily ever apply for any repara
tions?  Did your fa mily apply for reparations? 
A: Oh yes, but we -- we [indecipherable] wrong 
side. Breslau became Polish, so we did not get 
the German, the f -- restitution, the full one. If 
people for instance who were on the German part 
of Berlin got three times as much as the one on th
e other part of Berlin. So
 we never got all that 
much. We  got some  for my lost education, but 
nothing terrible dramatic. I had to earn my 
money. 

Q: And in your fa mily, your -- your -- your sister
™s children, and perhaps they even have 
children, how much do they 
know about the Holocaust? 
A: Tom -- Tom is very interested, an
d he pushed me  into all that, and -- 
Q: Tom is your nephew? 

A: Yeah, that my sister™s son, the older one. You 
didn™t talk to him. I think -- what did I -- so 
ma ny peopl e talked to him. He was the one, the ma n -- you -- 

Q: It doesn™t ma tter, yeah.

A: -- on the Saint Louis, you n -- oh my -- Sco
tt. You know Scott?  [indecipherable]. Well, you 
are not really the Saint Louis part
, you are the other -- we
ll, he -- Tom is very interested, and he 
want me to dictate -- ma ybe from this [ind
ecipherable] some thing. Ken is not. Yeah, he is 
younger, six years younger, ma kes a big different. A
nd his whole -- he has a wife, three children. 
He is still interest ed, but To
m always says, I want it for Ken children. I don™t even know if 
they™d be interested. You know, this is ancient 
hist ory for them. And another few years who will 
be left who lived through it?  
I am al most the youngest refug
ee. Anybody later was foreign born. 
Anybody who was six, seven years old when they came over here. 

Q: Is there anything else you™d like to add?
 Is there anything el
se you™d like to add? 
A: I™ll probably reme mb er in my bathtub later. 
That™s an old story, isn™t it, when you want -- 
after the party you reme mber what you want to say, but I don™t think so. I -- 

Q: I think it would be good if we could stop 
now and then we™ll show some  photographs. 
A: Okay. Okay. Am I on the tele -- these are my parent -- 
Q: I™m -- I™m sorry, I™m sorry, hang on --  
A: Okay?  These are my mother and father in 
the good old times, in the 30™s, before all the 
disasters happened. They look happy, they look more pr
osperous than later. They look also as if 
they weighed more than they did 
in later years when all the worries were so hard on them. I like 
these two pictures. Okay, this is
 a picture of the Sa int Louis wh
en she left Ha mburg. I think the 
skyline is the ham -- from Ha mburg. And the li
ttle tugboats are kicking the ship off to a good 
voyage. This is a picture that the ship photographe
r took of the people as they got on. My father 
is walking ahead with a hand full of paper todocume nt our exit. I am
 the second one, looking a 
little suspicious, and my sister follows me , l
ooking where she is walking. I presume my mother 
was take -- comi ng behind us and didn™t get 
in the picture any more. Wa s in -- in May 30, 1939.

This is a picture taken on the Saint Louis. I™m
 pretty sure that it was taken on the way out, 
because we would never have looked that ni ce 
on the way back, when we were worried. My 
mother™s the first one, I™m behind my father, then my
 sister is standing on 
my father™s other side. 
And it™s just one of the nicest pi
ctures of the trip, when we we re still thinking we were happy. 
This is a pi cture of the committee that the cap
tain had [indecipherable]
 to act as a liaison 
between the very upset passengers and the captain
, who tried to keep the boat steady. I do not 
know all the name . My father is 
the one in the center with the 
bow tie. I do know all the me n, but 
not their name s. I™ m trying to -- ma ybe they 
are on the back?  Back of the picture?  Goodma n, 
Weiss, Manasser, Zellner, Joseph, Housedorf, Vendick. 
Q: Okay. You can read it. 

A: Oh, without?  Okay. The name  of the me n 
who were the committee was the first one, 
Goodma n, the fi -- on the left, We iss, Manasser,
 my father, Zellner, Joseph, Housedorf and 
Vendick. There are two, four, six, seven. One of 
the me n, I should be nasty enough to say, got on 
the committee because he argued about everyt hing. Anything the committee du -- di d, he 

disliked, so they put him on. This is Havana, whic
h at that time was a beautiful city, from what 
we could see, and we were very close. You s
ee the little boat in the fr ont. Relatives of the 
passenger would hire these boats, they would leav
e Havana and go around the ship two or three 
times, screaming up to their relatives, ever
ybody was hollering for everybody, reassuring us, 

which didn™t work, and we would ask question, what
 could be done, but we never got an answer 
because there was no answer. Then on June first, 
the ships were not allowe d to come  any more, 
and we knew we had to leave.
