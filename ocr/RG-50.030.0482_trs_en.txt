Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum with Helen Bamber, conducted 
by Vera Frankel on December 28
th
, 2003, in London. This is tape number one, side A. Helen 
Ba mber, tell me  about your background first of 
all, where you grew up and the fami ly you grew 
up in. 

Answer: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London. My father was born in 

America. My mother was born in the UK, in Engl
and, of course, as it was then. Their parents 
came from Poland and Russia respectively. Intere
stingly, one of my gran
dfathers was actually 
born, we found out ma ny years later, in what 
was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me , 
Oswiecim, Auschwitz. And that sent shivers down
 our spine ma ny years later. Now, it wasn™t a 
happy household. My father was an accountant. He
 was a very obsessional ma n, and during most 
of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was 
born in 1925. So I grew up in the years of 
unemployment, dole queues, and the 
rise of fascism. And I t hink this combination absorbed my 
father completely inasmuch as he was somethi
ng of a visionary. He could see, I believe, what 
was going to happen in Europe. He was bilingual, 
he spoke German perfectly, and a number of 
other languages, and I™ve never 
understood how it was that ama n who wa s not -- you know, was 
quite simply educated in this country, a good sc
holar, but how it was that
 he spoke the languages 
he did, and how he could be bilingual in Germ
an. I never understood that, and I don™t now, but 
he was. So, as an only child, in a house in nor
th London, with dimi nishing 
financial resources, as 
my father™s activities on behalf
 of people who were -- who ne
eded to leave Nazi Germany 
became mor e -- how can I say more active, or more
 -- ye s, more active. And as I was exposed to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

his version of events, his -- his horror of fascism,
 his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and 
indeed, in England where we -- I mean, I was fr
equently aware of Mosely™s fascists marching 
through north London, and the east end of London. I™m
 losing my thread, but what I™m trying to 
do is to give a background about an only child 
growing up in what was later a working class 

area, because we had to move from a  rather su
mp tuous house to some thing very mode st. Wa s a -
- a -- a kind of house of -- of 
s-some thing bordering on fear a
nd apprehension of what mi ght 
happen in the future. My father insisted that we
 listened to the broad
casts from Ger many, which 
he would translate. So that as
 a young child, I -- I was exposed to quite a lot of my fat her™s 
understanding and vision, but also 
his fears, and my own. N - -  my 
mother tried hard to avoid all 
this by -- and it wasn™t that she didn™t care, it
 was that like so ma ny pe
ople of her time, and h -- 
and as is always the case, she actually couldn™t face the possibility of what mi ght happen. She 

began to dise ngage as much as she could. As my  
father™s activities became, as I said earlier, 

more -- more active, there were refugees fr
om Germany who came to our house, en route 
perhaps for some where else, but would often stay 
in my house for some  days, weeks, and -- and 
as a sickly child, on top of everything else, be
cause I had what later wa
s thought to have been 
TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my tim
e, ma ny c hildren had it, I was bi -- be -- I was 
bedridden for a lot of my  -- of
 the winters of my childhood. And 
they -- there were -- people who 
came and stayed would often come  and talk to 
me , sit on my bed and talk to me , but they 
wouldn™t talk to me  about childhood events, or 
childhood dreams , and -- and fantasies, and i -- 
yo-you know, celebration. It was about what happene
d to them, and what was -- what happened 
in Germany. And I reme mber there was a pianist 
who stayed with us, who I disliked very much. 
I found him pompous, although he played beau
tifully. And he came and sat on my be d 
frequently. But he ma de  a great change in my 
life, in my childish -- my childhood. He said to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

me , ﬁ You know, you don™t have to be
 ill like this. If you 
want to, you can get out of bed when I 
leave this room, and you can walk
 round the room, touch all the fu
rniture, and get back into bed, 
and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself
.ﬂ Now, I disliked him more than ever when he 
said this, because of course, i
llness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. But I did 
exactly what he said. I got up and I walked roun
d the room, and I touched everything, and I said 
to myself. ﬁI can ma ke changes, I can be in contro
l.ﬂ I wasn™t very confident, but I said it. And I 
don™t know, I think that was a 
-- a turning point for me .  
Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father™s outlook on life 

influenced your persona
lity, and your thinking? 
A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some  
ways, although I don™t wa nt to ma gnify it. I was 
very moved by my father. I still am when I look b
ack and I think of his l
oneliness and his despair 
later on, when the Holocaust came. But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother™s 

social skills, her interest in cl
othes, her interest in the pia
no, and her desire for me  to be 
some how -- I don™t know, some thing very special. 
Not unusual, of course , in Jewish fa milies. 

But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between
 them both, really. Late
r they divorced; when 
I was in my late teens, they 
divorced. But it was an unhappy household, and I™m not sure that I -- 
I mean, I think I had a good role model for my futu
re in human rights. I™m 
not sure that I had a 
good role model in terms of relationships, and in
 terms of parenting. I le
arned, though, as a -- as 
an only child in an unhappy household, with thes
e issues, I learned how
 to negotiate, and I 
learned how to compromise. And these, I think, ar
e skills I have. And that come s not only from 
later experience, but I learne
d it in the fa mily home. 
Q: You -- you spent your teenage ye
ars, I believe, in London duri
ng the war. Tell me  about what 
that experience was like, and -- and how you th
ink now, looking back, that it affected you.

A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- fo
rgive me, I grew up in the war. What can I say 
about it?  In some  ways, it was almos t  -- it™s crazy 
to say this, it was almo st a relief from the fear 
of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans 
came, specially chosen for annihilation. So in 
other words, when I was involved in a bombing 
incident, when I was fire watching in central 
London, when central London was terribly bombed, 
and was buried, albeit it -- it -- it wa
sn™t as dramatic or terrible as 
it sounds, but I was -- I wasn™t 
hurt. I suppose in modern terminology, I was some wh
at trauma tized, and I still find it difficult to 
go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was fire
watching in a solicitor™s office, and standing 
on some  steps, going down to the baseme nt where a
ll the documents were kept with little bits of 
pink ribbon tying them up. And I wa
s going -- there was only about four
 or five steps, but as I 
stood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me. 
And I think that yes, 
I do have a phobia from 
that time, but I also know that -- th
at  I ti --  I felt at the time, a
nd I still do, that I was taking my 
chances with the rest of the population, and that 
I wasn™t being particularly chosen at that 
particular time. And so in a ma d sort of way, the 
war had it™s reliefs for 
me, although it killed, in 
another bombing incident, an aunt of mi ne
, who had a great influence on me , who wa s 
considerably left wing. Did a lot of work 
in the east end of London, working with the 
Communists, and the Jewish community there in 
trying to co mbat the activities of Mosely™s 
fascists. And she was involved in th
e much glorified battle of Cabl
e Street, which is an incident 
where when Mosely was going to ma rch down one 
particular area of the 
east end, the people of 
the east end brought out all their fu
rniture, their -- their pianos, thei
r -- their tables, their kitchen 
equipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end. And for me , with a father who was 

growing into despair as to what
 was happening in Europe, this simple act me ant a great deal to 
me . It was about resi stance, and it was about fi
nding ways, even if they didn™t succeed ultimately 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

in ma king a stand, in ma king a statement. So my 
aunt was another very strong influence in my 
life because she represented anythi ng but desp
air. She was vigorous, she wa s sexy. She had the 
strangest advice as to how to 
behave in any sexual encounter. 
She was a fascinating, vigorous, 
lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shoc
king everybody, platinum 
blonde hair, but also 
doing these fantastic things. An -- and she was a 
-- she was a very interesting infl uence in my 
life, and it was a terrible blow to me  when sh
e -- when she and her fiancé, some one I think she 
mi ght have ma rried, were killed when 
the Café de Paris had a direct hit. 
Q: Café de Paris in London? 

A: The café de p -- ki -- the Café de P-Paris wa
s a very famous  café for dancing, ma ny soldiers 

and people would -- would go there 
on leave, and it was rather posh, 
and I think not inexpensive, 
but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely sa
fe. I don™t know why people 
talk about some thing 
being absolutely safe. It had a 
direct hit. Her body was never 
found, and I reme mber going with 
my mother to try and identify various objects th
at were lined up some where in the mi ddle of 
London where people queued and looked at these obj
ects. Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing. 
Q: You were brought up with this kind of terribl
e fear of what mi ght happen to the Jews of 
Europe. Wh en did you actually begin to disc
over, and to understand what was going on? 
A: I think I always understood, because my fath
er had understood what was going on in the -- in 
-- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish peop
le and the Gypsies, and the me ntally defective. 
He had read me n ka -- ﬁMein Kamp f,ﬂ he had re
ad other docume nts. The information actually 
was there for anyone who wanted to know it. Me
mbers of parliame nt denied all knowledge of 
concentration camps, and people -- I think including 
my father, but I™m not sure about this -- did 
lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade governme nt 
of what was going on , but I don™t think that -
- that anybody really wanted to 
listen at the time of 
-- of a total war situation. And ma ybe for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
6 
 
other reasons as well. So I alwa
ys knew, I always knew about th
e concentration camps. It was no 
secret in my house that people were being ta
ken to concentration camps and murdered. We  
weren™t -- I -- I don™t always know
 -- now when I look back, it™s di
fficult to be accurate. Whether 
the details were known, I™m not su -- to me , I™ m 
not sure, but certainly the word concentration 
camps, in my German -- my father would say it 
in German, was well known in my household. So 
it wasn™t a stranger to me .  
Q: What years are we talking about here? 

A: I™m talking about the -- the y
ears -- the -- the -- the -- all du
ring the war really, th-the war 
years. The forties. The 1941, ™42, ™43, were 
years in which whilst the war was going on, and 
London was being bombed, my father was 
talking about concentration camps.  
Q: I believe there was an exhibition of phot
ographs in London. An exhibition of photographs 
from the camps which had a very profound i mpact on you. Can you recall how old you were 

when you went to see that exhibition and wh
at -- what stayed in your mi nd from that? 
A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of phot
ographs came -- yes, that™s right, there was an 
exhibition of photographs that was shown in London. It wasn™t the photogra
phs that shocked me  
so much as the attitude of people. And I think th
at if I™m not mi staken, that the photographs were 
discontinued;  that means to say the exhibition 
was discontinued because of people™s reactions. 
Now, I™ m not quite sure what that reaction wa
s, but you know, after the 
war people did not want 
to believe, they did not want 
to understand the totality of wh
at had happened, and they didn™t 
really -- they had their own preoccupations 
with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and 
rationing, and everything else. And to bring home to
 people the atrocities of
 the Nazis in that -- 
to that extent, I think either didn™t move pe
ople in the right wa y -- but whatever happened, it 
didn™t -- I don™t think 
that it was received with -- with -- 
with real comprehe
nsion, I think, with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
7 
 
real under -- l-let™s say how difficult it was for 
anyone to understand what
 really happened. It 
wasn™t the pictures though, I think, 
that influenced me  to -- to want to go to Germany at the end 
of the war. I think that I™d started to think about
 it for quite a long time,
 and I -- I™m -- and in -- 
it™s very interesting that the more one talks a
bout this, the more you begi
n to understand, or the 
more you think about it, you begin to understand 
your motives. People often ask me  why did I 
want to go to the camps, wh -- was it some  voyeuris
tic reason, was it -- what
 was it that ma de me  
want to go and to work for the survivors. A
nd I think it really, now 
talking today, I think it 
wasn™t only my father, because my father was su
nk in despair at the end of the war, whereas 
everybody was rejoicing, and even 
I was rejoicing, my father wa
s despairing because of the -- 
the catastrophic events that ha
d happened, and the -- th
e death of so ma ny pe
ople, not only in the 
concentration camps, but the -- the 
-- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- th
e -- the awfulness of that war, 
I think just -- just crushed him,
 and he was very despairing. He also had his own personal reasons 
for -- he was living alone then, and he was very 
sad. But I think it was also my aunt, because my 
aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to
 my father. And her belief was you mu st do 
some thing, you can do some thing, you can do anythi
ng if you want to. And so I suppose it was 
my father™s knowledge, and my aunt ™s kind of
 message about go for it, anybody can do it, do 
some thing, ma ke a statement, howe ver -- ev
en if you™re waving your arms and nobody™s 
watching, do it, was what she was about. I th
ink that™s really what influenced me .  
Q: Do you reme mber actually taking this de
cision?  And how old were you at the time? 
A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief 
Unit, that was in formation before the end of 
the war. I think I was then about 18, and I ma de so
me  enquiries and I went to see them, and they 
announced that I was very young, but they -- they said
 yes, they™d consider me . And I joined the 

relief unit in the hope that
 I would be able to go. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. Could you tell me  what the unit consisted of, who organized it, 
how it was run, how big it was? 

A: The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in 

that squa re, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place 
I think was it™s na me . It was a -- a house on a 

corner, and it consisted of an of
fice with about six or seven people 
in it. It was financed, I think, 
by the -- now I™m not sure about that, it mi ght 
have been the Central British Fund, I cannot 
reme mber. This -- this could eas
ily be established how the orga
nization was funded. I do have a 
book about it, but I don™t read the book, and I™m 
not sure why. But anyway, there is a lot of 
information about the funding of this organiza
tion. And there were people being trained to go. 
And these were people who were volunteers, it 
wa s a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to 
go, as far as I know. And I started to -- to -- to 
train with them, telling 
my parents -- I was then 
living with my mother; my fa ther was separa ted,
 as I said. And this was going to be quite a 
diffi cult issue. I reme mb er sitting in Saint Ja
me s™s Park, and watching the ducks where I™d me t 
my father, and I said to him, ﬁI -- I want to go 
to Germany.ﬂ And he didn™t really say very much. 
He said, ﬁWell, you must be sure you want to go
, and you™ll have to be 
safe and careful.ﬂ Which 
hadn™t actually occurred to me  at the time, about
 being safe. Being careful, yes. But he -- he 
didn™t express great enthusiasm or dismay or su
rprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast. 
And her dreams  of what  she had expected of me  fo
r the future began to disappear to some  extent, 
for her. She saw me  taking a path that she real
ly didn™t like, and I suppose as a mother now it 
was, looking back, it must have been hard for 
her. But I was very determined to go. And so I 
continued to -- to train, to -- to
 be exposed to a psychologist w
ho in pri -- in small intimate 
sessions would -- individual sessions would ask 
you questions, but also in group sessions. And I 
suppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at th
e time, who -- not all Je
wish by the way, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
9 
 
think that™s important to know. There were seve
ral Quakers, people who felt very strongly about 
what had happened, who wanted to -- who offered 
their -- their services. 
And so that™s what I 
did, and we went on various trai
ning courses, to a kibbutz some wh
ere in England, in Wiltshire, I 
believe, where we undertook various
 training in ma p reading a
nd first aid, and -- but I do 
reme mber -- I do reme mber one session where 
we sat in a group and I think it was the 
psychologist asked everyone what they felt they 
expected to find, and how 
they would deal with 
the very impossible situations, and how they w
ould deal with people who they cou -- who felt -- 
who didn™t want to be helped, or were past 
helping. And I reme mber searching my -- my th-
thoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what
 is the answer to that
, faced with a lot of 
people who you can™t help. And I reme mber saying 
that maybe one has to accept that there will 
be people you can™t save. And ma ybe  if there ar
e children and younger people there, we have to 
put our energies into trying to he
lp them. And that ma ybe -- this 
now sounds all rather simplistic, 

but and ma ybe if -- if people s
ee the energy going into the young 
and the children, that would be 
some compe nsation for them. I don™t think it 
was such a bad idea now, looking back, because 
there were ma ny peopl e that couldn™t
 be helped. Anyway, that was --
 that was what I said at the 
time.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is tape number one, side B of an inte
rview with Helen Bamber. Tell me a little bit more 
about the actual training process, 
and the extent to which you were really prepared me ntally and 

physically for what you were about to find.  

A: We ll, l-looking at how people ar
e prepared today, say in aid agen
cies, which still leaves a lot 
to be desired, I™m not sure that we really were 
prepared so well. It was a disparate group of -- o-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
10 
 
of volunteers. There were nurses, there were people
 with a variety of skills at the time. And -- 
but I can™t reme mber sitting down a
nd really -- th-th-there was just 
that one discussion we had in 
which we were aske d to face the possibility of no
t being able to help everyone, not being able to 
save everyone. It is important  because it st ayed 
in my mi nd and it -- it™s the situation that I™m 
faced with every day of my life now. And it™s always
 hard, it™s always ha rd and it should always 
be hard. But it has to be there, 
that acceptance that you can™t save everyone. But it™s so hard. We 
went to various -- as I said, we went to this 
kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a 
van, and the idea was that we had to follow 
the ma p and find our own way there. And ma p 
reading and finding our way around 
with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the 
provisions to be given. On the -- on the questi
on of driving, and ma p 
reading, and knowing how 
to distribute the wherewithal, 
food, or provisions and so on. I don™
t really reme mber, even with 
the help of the psychologist, a gr eat deal of he
lp about how we would fe el, faced with what we 
were going to face, which wasn™t only about a d -- 
a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every 
sense of the word. Suffer i ng from
 ma lnutrition, suffering from loss,
 some  behaving as if they 
were quite ma d, all of that. But it
 was also that we were going to
 a country that was in rubble, 
and starving. And I certainly wasn™t prepared for th
e fact -- I™d hardened all these years my heart 
against the German people. I™d grown up with a di
slike and fear of the Germans. And when I was 
on the train going out, on my own, with all my
 l uggage and baggage and God knows what -- I 
mean, what a performa nce that was, I reme mb
er seeing starving German
 children standing along 
the railway line, holding out their hands. And I wa
s traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and 
everybody threw out their bread and 
whatever they had with them to the starving children. Now 
that I wasn™t prepared for, and that was hard
 too, because these were childr en, these were 
innocent children. And that brough
t a conflict that I ha
dn™t -- or an understanding that I hadn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
11 
 
expected to find in myse lf. And I learned that th
e very first mo me nt I traveled. So there were 
ma ny things one wasn™t prepared for. One wasn™t
 prepared for the deva stated cities. No, we 
weren™t pr epared, but ma ybe there was no way 
to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I 
think, how catastrophic was the scene th
at we were t-to find eventually. 
Q: Let me  take you back a little bit. Can you te
ll me  how you were ki
tted out?  What you looked 
like and actually the journey?  How does an 18 ye
ar old go ma ke her way across half of Europe 
and end up where?  I don™t know what your de
stination was, what had you been told? 
A: My journey rema ins really a bit of a myster
y to me  myself. I was then just 20 by the way, 
when I went. I think I was -- have to be very care
ful about this, but I thin
k I just -- I was just 20 
years old. And I had unifor ms, we all had. We  ha
d officer™s uniform, we had officer™s rank. And 
an ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear. I don
™t know what you call it now. It™s awful that I 
don™t, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordina
ry, and I traveled with
 the yellow star on my 
shoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we 
had elected to do. And that in itself was an 
undertaking. So not only was I ki
tted out beyond belief with a -- 
a kind of a canvas thing that 
was like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag 
that really I could bare
ly lift. And a bedroll 
and all kinds of -- the bedroll was very importa
nt later on, by the way. Th
e -- the mobile bath, I 
never knew it™s -- what it was inte
nded to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty 
underwear in it because I could so
rt of snap it together when 
anybody came  into the room. You 
know, it was one of those things, it sort of opene
d out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I 
don™t know, it was a kind of ghastly thing. But 
it was very good for underwear and you could 
smack the two pieces together when anybody came  in, and nobody could see. So that™s what I 
did with that. And there was a
ll kinds of equipment that one 
didn™t actually need. I think the 
bedroll was very important. So I was in uniform
, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m- my khaki, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
12 
 
my ghastly shoes and navy blue und
erwear and -- and the yellow 
star. And why I traveled on my 
own I do not know, but I think there was a very
 difficult procedure before anybody was allowed 
to go. There was a very careful vetting of every 
individual, not necessari
ly verbally, I me an I 
didn™t meet anybody, but I know that there was 
one woma n who belonged to the Communist 
party, who was not allowed to go. Which was a very
 great disappointment to
 all of us who knew 
and loved her. So, there was a very careful vettin
g of each individual, and I think there was a fear 
by the officials involved, that Jews going out were 
in some  way -- Jews going out to work in the 
for mer concentration camps, or in Holland, or  in
 Greece were some how either a pr ovocation or  a 
difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to contro
l. Whatever it was, it was difficult. And so 
everybody was vetted very carefully, and althou
gh we came under the ausp
ices directly of 
UNRRA, we were also responsible di rectly also, 
to the British military government. At least we 
were in the British zone, that means to say thos
e of us who went to Germany. I had to go -- I 

mean, my fi nal destination was a 
small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept  spelling in my 
head all the time, E-i-l-
s. Eilshausen. It was difficult for me . I™d spoke some German by the way, 
because I™d learned from my father enough Germa n
 to get by. And the wors
t of all was that I 
went on a train from Victoria -- and I reme mber 
people were very helpful to me because I™m not 
very tall, and with all this h
eavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me . 
But of course they were also very -- they woul
d also look quite quizzical
ly at -- at the yellow 
star. So I was constantly in 
conversation, having to explain on
eself. Why one was going, what 
one was doing. And it was the beginning in a way of 
a kind of role in societ
y, in the public, that 
was always slightly uncomfortable for me , and it ex
ists to this day, where 
I have to explain what 
I™m doing for asylum seekers and refugees. And so
 I -- I™d already begun then to explain what I 
was doing with the yellow star on my shoulder. [t ape break] Where am I ?

Q: With the yellow star on your shoulder -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- you had to explain -- 

A: I had to explain myself to people as to why 
I was wearing the yellow star. And people were 
tolerant, the soldiers were good. But when I got 
to Calais, there was a hold up. The trains to 
Germany th -- were held up. I can™t reme mber why, whether is was overcrowding. It was quite a 

precarious journey eventually wh
en I did get on the train beca
use of the bridges, and the 
crossings. Bridges was dangerous and we all had to 
stand on one side of the train in order to give 
balance, which was a bit nerve-wracking.  

Q: How do you mean?  Can you explain? 

A: Well, yes, but I haven™ t quite got to Calais ye
t, because I was stuck. Let me  go back to Calais. 
I was stuck in Calais for a week, and we lived --
 I never took my clothes off i-in that week, and 

we stayed in -- oh, what
 are those huts called? 
Q: Nissen?  
A: Nissen huts, yes, in kind of dormi tories 
on paliasis and so on. And it was -- it was very 

primitive, and I reme mbe r  wandering round Calais 
all on my own and feeling so alone, as I™ve 
never felt in my life before. I hadn
™t been out of England before, wh
ich is strange in this day and 
age, but I had never been out of England. And so 
this was the first time  I™d been out. And I was 
very alone. Eventually we took our turn a
nd we were put on the train. And I reme mbe r  
some thing quite awful about this 
train because it would always st
op at various places which were 
not a station. I mean, in other words I couldn™
t -- you couldn™t -- you had no platform, you had to 
get off the train, so to speak, without a platform, 
in order to go to wherever you were going to be 
fed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen 
hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

route. And you would sit at a l
ong table and -- and be fed. And I 
had the utmost diffic ulty with 
my height, in being able to mount this train. An
d this was one of the -- 
the extraordinary things 
that preoccupied me  on the journey, all k-kind of, so
rt of incidental ridicu
lous things, not about 
the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven™s
 name  I was going to get up and down this train 
without making a complete idiot 
of myself. And usually I had to
 be hauled up and pushed from 
behind. But the train ricketed along, 
and there was one bridge that 
we crossed when we were in 
Germany, when the German guard, or person 
on the train came through carrying a lantern. 
Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one si
de of the train so that we actually balanced 
it properly, because there was a danger that th
e -- you know, that -- I don™t know, that ma ybe the 
train would topple over. Whatever
 it was, that™s what we a
ll did. And then there were the 
children on the way. And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightma re because I was so 

terrified that I would not
 find myself at this tiny village --
 no, it wasn™t Eilshausen, do forgive 
me , Eilshausen was my final destination. The 
station I had to get 
out at was Badounhausen. 
Badenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers. And I ha d to fi nd my way fr om 

Badenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Ei
lshausen, which was the headquarters of our 
unit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt --  a former cap
tain in the British army, and who was then the 
director of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up ou
r headquarters in the village. And because of the 
fact that I had taken a secretaria
l cour se at some stage, and was 
quite proficient in shorthand and 
typing, I was for the mo me nt, to be his assistant.
 And so that was my route, Badenhausen and 
then on to Eilshausen. I had no idea how I was 
going to get to Eilshaus
en. Well eventuallyI 
ma naged to get out of the station, 
and I™ll never forget it, it was 
an extraordinary sensation. I was 
in Germany, I was on a German station all on 
my own, with all my stuff. And I reme mber 
walking down the steps and walking into the 
street. And I reme mber hearing German, seeing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
15 
 
German lettering, an-and this some how Ger man s
hops and the name s of t hings in German, and 
German voi ces, and a s -- a terrible sense of pani
c. And it wa s the -- didn™t -- doesn™t -- didn™t 
happen to me very often, but I 
really for the mo ment was fr oze
n. And I reme mber standing there 
and thinki ng, ﬁMy God,ﬂ you know, ﬁwhat have I done?ﬂ I™m in the mi ddle of Ger many -- it isn™ t 
the mi ddle of Ger many, but you know -- I™m in Germany, a nd I™m with all this stuff. And I 

actually had to get the things dow
n in -- in dr ibs and drabs. I think some body helped me  because 
I couldn™t carry all the stuff do
wn the steps in one go. I think some body did help me , and I was 

standing there. A British officer came up in a car.
 And of course, this is what happens, and you 
learn this in post-war situations
. There is a kind of help that 
doesn™t normally exist that you -- 
you suddenly get used to. He drove up and he sa
id, ﬁ Where are you going? ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁI -- I 
have to get to Eilshausen.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhere the de
vil is that? ﬂ I said, ﬁI haven™t a clue.ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁWell get in the car and I™ll take you to my
 head -- my HQ, and -- and we™ll try and find out 
where Eilshausen is.ﬂ So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen. And you know, I can™t 
reme mber whether I ate -- I can remember cl
eaning up, I do reme mber that. I reme mb er there 
was some  sort of provision there,
 and I -- I cleaned myself up a 
bit. I mu st have been filthy 
because the week in Calais, it was not the most
 hygienic. And I felt an awful wreck, I reme mber 
that. And eventually -- but I don™t reme mber eati
ng anything at all, except 
on the train. And then 
he came down, and he was very efficient, rath
er like some thing you see in British war films now, 
on a Sunday. You know, very elegant, very beauti
ful, very well spoken. And he said, ﬁLook, I -- 
I™ve -- I™ve found a -- I™ve found somebody who -- we
 found Eilshausen, it™s a small village, I™ll 
get you there.ﬂ I™m still conscious of the yellow
 star. I was very grateful that some how -- you 
know, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star 
going to do for us out there?  Wa s it going to ope
n doors, was it going to br
ing hostility?  But I™d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
16 
 
explained to him what we were 
about, and he took it perfectly 
in his stride. And they found a 
driver for me , and finding a driver and finding a tr
uck in those days was hard work. So I had to 
wait quite a long time, and then I was taken to
 Eilshausen. And I reme mb er when I got to 
Eilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I me
t with Henry Lunzer, and 
I think he -- he and I 
at that time , at that mo ment, were the only 
people there, although some  British officers were 
comi ng over that evening for whatev
er, I don™t know what it was. A
nd he was in -- we  were in a 
commandeered house. It was the house of the loca
l Nazi, and that was the kind of way things 
were done there, that people were
 billeted in the houses of the 
for mer Nazis. And the for mer 
Nazi would have been Nazi leader, I don™t know
 whether he was imprisoned or whatever the 
situation was for him. But certain
ly some  of his staff was stil
l around, and I was very conscious 
of that.  

Q: Did you have any encounters with them, or -- 

A: Oh, I always had encounters with them. I alwa
ys had encounters with them. I -- I -- my work 
developed whilst I was in -- in Germany, betw
een two camps  and the headquarters. One camp 
was Belsen. The other camp was Kownitz, where I di
d a great deal of work, probably more than 
I did in Belsen, and Eilshausen, 
the vil --  the -- the center itself
. And it -- it was there, in the 
ma in, that I had encounters withthe local Germa ns, although I di
d have a very angry encounter 
with some body once later on, much later on, wh
en I was taking somebody from ORT, the 
American organization, well known, of course, in Amer
ica, to -- to Belsen. 
Shall I just tell that 
story now?  

Q: Sure. 

A: We -- one of the things -- and 
you see, the context is
 always so difficult, why with me  I don™t 
know, but I had to -- I was in Cell
e, C-e-double l-e, which is a very
 beautiful, me dieval town -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
17 
 
think it™s me dieval town, not so far from Belsen. 
And it was my job to rema in there, and to escort 
this Am-American woman who had come  -- I think it was ORT, and I was to take her to Belsen. 
And as we were eating in the -- 
the mess, the offi cer™s mess with other soldiers, and I was talking 

about Belsen, and this Ge rman waitress sort of 
said very arrogantly in Germany -- and I don™t 

know why there™s all this discussion about Bels
en, we didn™t know anything about the camp. We 
nev -- we didn™t know that there was a camp -- we 
don™t know what all this talk about Belsen is. 
But she was extremely arrogant, and for the firs
t and only time in my life, I stood up and I was 
going to hit her. And I was going to hit her very, 
very hard. And it was only when the -- the p -- 
the person from ORT could see what I was d -- about 
to do, that she restrained me , but I -- I have 
never since felt such violent rage
 as I felt for that woma n. And 
I do -- I can, amongst all the other 
things I understand, and I preach 
about tolerance, about this, about
 that, I can understand violent 
rage in such situations, because I was out of cont
rol, totally. But these servants that we had in 

Eilshausen, were Germa n. There was Frau Sh
ermburg and her daughter, who™d come  from 
eastern German -- Germany, who declared frequen
tly that they™d been raped. Frau Shermburg 
was the wife of a doctor who™d been killed, and he
r son had been killed in the war. Her daughter 
was a nurse.  

Q: And wha t  was there role exactly, at Eilshausen? 

A: Their role was to provi -- was to cook and he
lp us ma nage  the house. We were very, very -- 
what™s the word I want? Very correct. We -- He
nry Lunzer had been an offi cer in the British 
army. He maintained good standa
rds of behavior within the h
ouse. Nothing should be broken, 
nothing should be taken that was not ours. If it wa
s broken it had to be recorded as having been 
broken. We  were to be mi ndful and careful of 
everything. And Frau Shermburg and her daughter 

cooked and ma naged the house for us. There was pe
ople that came in and 
dealt with the laundry, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
18 
 
because by the time other people joined us -- I suppos
e I must have been one of the first, really, 
to go out to Eilshausen because ot her people jo
ined us later. Harry git -- Grojinsky from the 
Grojinsky bakers came , and he was the officer fo
r provisions and storekee -- stores. And so, as 
people came, laundry and other things needed to 
be in place, and a -- 
and as -- and a group of 
about I think at least seven or 
eight drivers, with trucks -- be
cause that was the only way we 
could ma nage to move around Germany obviou
sly, there was no transport provided.  
Q: So you were all billeted
 in this Nazi™s house? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you were looked after by this -- 

A: We ll, I wouldn™t say looked after, she -- Frau
 Shermburg was there to
 -- to cook, and -- but 
she was treated well, and I -- and 
she was billeted -- she wasn™t li
ving in the house, she lived in 
the village. But I reme mber there was one scene, a 
very ugly scene, where she told me that they 
were being attacked on the way ho
me, for being -- for working with 
us at the Jewish relief unit. 
And she said would some body esc ort her. And one of
 the men in the -- in the unit escorted her, 
one of the tall me n escorted her 
-- them, back to their billet. 
But there was one scene where a 
group of very angry people -- 

Q: From the  village? 

A: From the  village. They were angry, I think th
ey were drunk. They were very noisy, and they 
were carrying sticks, and they came to the house out
side, and they ma de a terrible din. And Frau 
Shermburg was -- she said these are the peop -- thes
e are people who di -- are going to hurt us if 
we go. And I, at that time, had b
een befriended by -- this was much
 later in my experience there, 
I™d been befriended by some body fr om the Jewish Br
igade, and I did quite 
a lot of work with 
him in Kownitz camp. And he had said to me  
on one occasion -- he taught me  ma ny things, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
19 
 
taught me  for example, how to wake up at a certain time, which was my difficulty. I was very 
young, and I had difficulty waking up. And he told me  that you can wake up any time you say 

you want to wake up, you can do it. So he taught me  
that, so that I wasn™t 
late for things. And -- 
but he also said to me  amongst ma ny other lessons, 
if you meet th -- a kind of
 -- in a -- a situation 
in which you™re isolated, and a lot of people are 
at the front door, or wha -- a-angry, don™t come  
out in a posse -- he didn™t use that word, but 
don™t come  out in a group, one of you goes out, only 
one. And on this occasion, I think because -- I do
n™t know whether we were short of people, or 
whether because I am so short and small, and wa
s quite sma ll -- slender at the time -- not now, 
but then, I -- I went out, and I opened the door, a
nd I stood by this -- in front of them, without 
saying anyt hi ng, with nothing in my hands. And we
 just looked at each ot her, and then they 
slunk away. But it was a very importa
nt lesson to me . It ma y not have
 worked. It could -- it need 
not have worked. They could have done anythi
ng, but they didn™t. A
nd it -- on this occasion it 
worked.  
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interv
iew with Helen Ba mber. To take you back again a 
little step, what kind of an area was Eils
hausen in, and what did it look like?   
A: Eilshausen was in We stphalia, some  dist
ance from Hanover, I should think about 20 
kilome ters, ma ybe less. It is -- it was a very b
eautiful village. Not so much the village itsel f, 
because some  of the houses were mo dern, you know, spacious, fantastic houses in their own 

grounds, with a laundry room and you name  it. But 
the walks were brilliant. The woods were 
lovely and we would often walk in the woods
. And there was a woma n called Frau Mome tchka 
who was Ge rman, who had ma rried a Jew, and w
ho died in the concentration camp, her husband 
did. And she really belonged nowhere. Because of
 her background she could not live within the 
German community. And oh -- because of -- she di
dn™t quite belong in the house. She was a very 
educated, elegant -- it™s very di
fficult to be elegant in those ci
rcumstances, but very dignified 
woma n in her 60™s, I would think. Ta ll, upright
, spoke a beautiful German, played the piano 
beautifully, used to play for us. How she came to
 us I do not know. She was there one day when 
I came back from a mi ssion. I don™t know where I™d
 been. I got to know her very well, she was 
very fond of me , we used to walk in the woods to
gether. It was beautiful, absolutely -- absolutely 
lovely, with streams, woods, hills. Lovely pla
ce. And she would talk 
to me about her husband, 
she would talk to me  about music, she would tr
y to correct my  terrible German. She was very 

much a teacher, a scholar. I had a gr eat admi ra
tion for her, and affection for her. It wasn™t 
unusual for people to end up in 
our house with very few questions asked. I me an, it™s very 
strange, but in those circumstan
ces you don™t ask very often. I 
don™t ever reme mber saying how 
did Frau Mome tchka come ?  I never knew. And 
I didn™t know how she went, because when I 
came back from one mi s sion, she wasn™t there. And I said, ﬁWhere™s Frau Mome tchka?ﬂ And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
21 
 
they said, ﬁOh no, she™s not here any more.ﬂ A
nd I never knew where she went, but because of 
the speed, and the ferocity of everything that
 was going on, and the anxi
ety of pri -- everyday 
life, I didn™t ask, and I never knew.  
Q: Now you™ve told us that you lived in this -- 
th-the house that had formerly been occupied by 
one of the local Nazis, but your office I believe,
 was elsewhere. Could you tell us about the 
office, and w -- and the job that you went 
there to do, and that you ended up doing?   
A: The office was a short distance from the house. It was just a v -- a few mi nutes walk from the 

house up a country lane, and was simply a low, 
brick building. I don™t 
know what it had been 
before. It looked a bit like a -- a 
keeper™s house. It -- but we used
 it as an office. It had obviously 
been a house. And I set up there with a typewriter 
and looked out over onto the fields. And -- and 
that™s really where the work of the unit was fa
shioned in that -- in that pl ace. There wa s a 
German ma n, who™d obviously been close to his 
ma ster, the Nazi, I think, leader. I took an 
instant dislike to him, and I would often work 
in the building on my ow
n. I -- I -- I™m a slow 
worker, and I often -- and 
I still do it, I work late and long, an
d I would often be in the building 
on my own and he™d be stoking the 
-- there was like a furnace, an old-fashioned furnace where 
you burned wood to heat the boilerfor hot water and so on. Like 
a boiler. And he would fidget 
about the house and I was terribly
 uneasy with him there. And I f
ound some  leaflets in the house, 
Nazi leaflets. I asked him to throw them in the 
fire. There was a whip -- I always reme mber that, 
there was a whip hanging up on the wall. Now, that
 could have been for anything, I mean it need 
not have had an ominous  -- a particularly ominous me aning, ma ybe they had animals, I don™t 

know. But it -- it ma de me  very uneasy. And I said
 to him one day, ﬁWhat is that doing there? 
Why is it here in the hou
se?  It™s not some thing I want to s
ee.ﬂ And he said, ﬁHm, it was always 
in the house.ﬂ And I -- I sa
id, ﬁPlease take it away, get rid of 
it.ﬂ But he didn™t like me , and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
22 
 
didn™t like him. And Frau Shermbur g -- Frau 
Shermburg looked to me  for arbitration and 
negotiation. She recognized very quickly that I 
could negotiate for herand her daughter with 
Henry the director, and f-for any facilities that 
she needed. And that beca
me  my role. She would 
show me  photographs of her husband, the doctor 
who was killed, and her 
son, standing near the 
Arc de Triomphe. And -- 
Q: In uniform, presuma bly? 

A: In uniform, looking very much the Nazi -- well,
 the -- the German offi cer
 that he was. And it 
was very difficult, it was very difficult. It wa
s a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband, 
her son. She ma intained, as did her daughter, and I 
believe it to be so, that when the Russians 
came in to where they were living in eastern 
Germany, they were both raped ma ny times and in 
front of each other and that -- that was not su
rprising, the story of rape was very common, both 
in -- particularly within the Russian zone. A
nd you know, these kind of situations, to do with 
who you are and where you™re born, become  very re
levant -- and the choices that you ma ke. And 
you have to ask yourself what choices did sh
e have?  On the other 
hand she didn™t see the 
significance of showing me  the picture of her son 
standing near the Arc de Triomphe. I did have 

to point that out to her. It wa
s a -- it was diffi cult, this relatio
nship with local Germans, very 
difficult. And I reme mbe r  looking out of the wind
ow one day when a colleague of mi ne, Edith 
Blau, who™d been in a concentration camp, and 
who™d been liberated with her mother by the 
Russians, and both of them were living in our
 house -- as I say, people came and went, and 
people stayed, and she stayed. And she™s now in 
this country, in -- in
 England. And she was 
passing a group of Ger mans in -- she was in unifo
rm with a yellow star, she became a me mber of 

our team. And I s -- I was looking out of the window
 and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the 
German wome n who™d obviously ma de a rema rk about
 the Jews, having seen the yellow star. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
23 
 
tensions were high. Strange things did happen. 
There were stories about Germans putting wire 
across the streets in order that 
British soldiers on motorcycle c
ould be decapitated, and that did 
happen. And it was an uneasy time . You did not sleep easily, let me  put it that way. You -- you 
were aware, all the time, of te
nsions, of hatred. Your own and 
others. And that was hard. That 
was hard, that bit.  

Q: Tell me  about the first few days, fi rst few weeks in your job.  

A: We ll, for the first few weeks of
 my  job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some  sort of 
order into what was a fairly ch
aotic situation, and to try to fo
rmulate some  kind of strategy for 
the admi nistration of a headquarters. I™d never ha
d any experience of that before, but he, being 
an army officer, a captain in the British army, ha
d experienced -- and so I learned from hi m. And 

we did quite well, I think; he was efficient. But 
after just a couple of da
ys we went to Belsen 
together. We drove. And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henr
ieki e™s team, she led the fi rst team into Belsen, 

the fi rst team of the Jewish Relief Unit into Bels
en. And her team was there, and I must say I was 
incredibly nervous. It was reassuring being w
ith Henry, but neverthele
ss, I was very nervous. 
Now, I can™t reme mber that first day very well. 
We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which 
had belonged to the -- oh, to the 
ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, I™ll come back to 
that. But you know that the people who™d been in
 -- liberated from ca mp one, when camp one 
was burned down, they were taken to the concre
te blocks, where the German ar my had -- had 
been billeted. 

Q: We  just paused there, and 
-- to allow Mrs. Bamber to reflect on whose barracks we were 

talking about exactly. 

A: It was the for mer German barracks, but I --
 I -- I do not -- th-the 
name , it has escaped me . 
Some people refer to is as the former SS bar -- 
barracks. I™m not sure. But whatever, the people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
24 
 
were incarcerated there in the barracks. And th
e barracks were bleak, they were kind of solid 
blocks of concrete. I can™t reme mber  the lighting. I always reme mber it as very dim. I reme mber 
candles. I reme mber staying all night one -- on on
e occasion with s-some body who died in one of 
the rooms. And it was over time  talking to people 
in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter 
with the inmates. Now, it wasn™t on that fi rst day. That fi rst day was a kind of initiation into the 

whole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time
. I met the unit -- the wo
rkers. I went to camp 
one, which had been burned down. I saw the 
mo unds, these huge mounds where had -- which 
had for med the ma ss graves. It was ve ry -- there 
was always about that place particul arly, that 
camp one, there was this strange, sweet smell 
which I -- I know to be the smell of death. I 
believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the sm
ell of geraniums, because that™s what it was like. 
It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums 
and crushing them in your hand and then smelling 
them. And it™s -- it™s a sweet, dank smell, and th
at was the smell. And I™ve never forgotten it. 
And sometimes I™ m re minded of it when the smell 
returns, that kind of dank smell. And this 
sense of awfulness, the se nse of death was th
ere in that space that was empty. There were no 
bodies, there was nothing. There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty 

space. And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was 

by the side of you. You felt very une
asy. I -- I know that I went there the fi rst day, and I went 
there many times with other people who were i
nvolved in some  kind of mourning. They ma y be 
people who had come  as Jewish soldiers -- much la
ter, this was much later -- or  they were the 
inma tes, although very few of the m went there. 
But I went there some time s, and I attended the 
ceremony there, where the monume nt was erecte
d, the first monument, in me mory. I believe 
there™s a pi cture somewhere of my unit marching
. It™s somewhere in the Vina library, and I™ve 
never been to see it, but I believ
e it exists, because people have told me  that it does, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
25 
 
recognize me, ma inly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason. But I 
returned ma ny times, and I spent many days ther
e, and I spent a long period in the winter, 
because I reme mber sleeping in a sl eeping bag with
 all my clothes on in the very cold winters 
that followed. And what was I doing there? And that
™s the di fficulty, I can™t really remember that 
I had a particular role as I had 
in other places. I went and I ta
lked, and I can™t reme mber anybody 
asking me  to do that, or seeing any value in it.
 So ma ybe I elected to go. When I knew that a 
driver or some body was going to Belsen, which was 
very frequent, people frequently went there 
with provisions or with papers, or what have
 you. There was no other 
way of communicating 
than by going some where. The telephone systems 
were down, and it was very difficult to ma ke 
telephone calls. And so it was -- the easiest thi
ng was to always go to 
a place. So it is not 
surprising that I elected to go, and I elected 
to go I think because over time I found that by 
talking to people -- that  by receiving the informati
on that they gave me , wa
s in itself a v -- a v -- 
a value. That doesn™t sound very profound, but peopl
e who give the most terrible information, of 
death, destruction, loss. Who rock with mi sery 
and despair, who are desperately fearful, who 
want to die, ma ny of them, but can
™t, it™s very important  to receive 
that information in a way that 
says to people, I am your witness, 
I am here to tell your story. If you 
can™t tell it, I will be able to 
tell it for you. But all I can be is
 your witness, I can™t take away 
the past. Now I didn™t learn that 
quickly, I learned it painfully because  I always 
felt I couldn™t do anything, what am I doing here? 
I can™t take away the past, I can™t
 change anything. So what is th
e value of my presence, and why 
do I keep comi ng? And I think it was because I be
gan to learn that being a witness, simple and 
ordinary and limited as that ma y be, does have 
a value to the person who ma y not live very long, 
and who knows it. And so, I think in a way that 
was one of my tasks, but why I spent so ma ny 
weeks there, sleepi
ng on the floor, and what work I did with
 He nry there, or with anybody else, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
26 
 
honestly can™t tell you. I later went
 back there ma ny times, when I was responsible much later 
for what was referred to as the TB train. I was se
nt to nic -- by Henry, to
 negotiate in Switzerland 
with a Jewish organization, huma nitarian orga
nization for the transfer
 of young people suffering 
from tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery
 would be very much greater if they were 
taken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of
 the ways people treated 
tuberculosis in those 
days. And I went to Switzerland and I me t this 
extraordinary woma n. And 
I reme mbe r  saying to 
her -- I wasn™t in uniform, and 
I don™t know why, ma ybe it was politic
 -- no, to be -- I just can™t 
reme mber. And I reme mber saying to her, ﬁWhy -- why -- how did you recognize me ? ﬂ  And she 
said, ﬁIt really wasn™t difficu
lt to recognize you, I would have 
recognized you anywhere, as one 
Jew to another.ﬂ Anyway, I went with the x-rays,and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe 

me, I™ m saying something extraordinary. Because 
to persuade  people, young people, who were 

desperate to leave Belsen and othe
r camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to 
England, desperate to get out. To persuade them 
to have an x-ray to identify that they were 
suffering tuberculosis wa s the la
st thing that they wanted.  
Q: Because it excluded them from -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- going to this country? 

A: Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that. And there was all ki nds of 

maneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t --
 name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare. 
And it -- it was a killer, I mean 
I -- I worked incredibly hard, 
and I reme mber losing my voice 
with the sheer -- you know, the -- 
the energy needed to persuade 
people that they wouldn™t be 
able to go anyway, that they woul
d be identified anyway at some  
point as having the illness. And 
I™d hoped I was right to do that. 
I wasn™t working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
27 
 
persuade people. And then I had to persuade 
this -- to go with this delight ful woman and 
persuade the Swiss authorities. And I reme mb
er a very suave, very
 beautiful, tall Swiss 
gentlema n, who ma de clear to me , reluctantly, 
that yes, a certain number of young people would 
be acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to
 be  treated for their tubercul osis, on the 
understanding only that they were 
-- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the 
end of their treatment. And that 
was th -- one of the first political
 lessons of my lifetime, because 
I learned about the la -- lo -- 
lack of compassion, I lat -- learne
d about politics, and in that one 
meeting, I learned it all. I learned about official
dom, bureaucracy that -- th
at -- that -- tha-tha -- 
that -- that protects people fr
om the truth, it protects peop
le from looking at that sick, young 
person. And I was very sick at heart myself, I was 
very upset. But I™d actua
lly got the agreement, 
so I went back to Germany, and then there wa
s an enormous activity on my part, and others 
helping me , to try to arrange for the evacuation 
of the young people. And I have pictures of this 
that can be supplied, to go on what was referred
 to as the TB train from Hanover station, which 
was bombed and derelict, catastroph
ically so, to Switzerland. And 
eventually -- I mean it was, I 
suppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn™t feel lik
e a triumph, really. Nothing -- it just felt right, 
I suppose, that young people should be treated even
tually after ma ny mont
hs, having fought with 
ma ny officials, British army officials in --particularly on one occasion, when I needed a 
document that hadn™t come . They ne eded about fi ve 
or six different permissions in order to leave 
the camps, from the British military government. And 
if they hadn™t got all five or si x, they 
couldn™t travel. And in one case I had to go to Dü
sseldorf, I think it was, and persuade them to 
allow a young person in Düsseldorf to travel to 
Switzerland. And I think 
we were all day trying 
to persuade them. Finally I think it was only becau
se we offered a lift. We  were going to Berlin 
to catch the trai n, to put the document on the tr
ain. I mean, it™s all very primitive stuff. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
28 
 
and I got per -- I think that he 
was persuaded because we gave 
a lift to some body to Berlin. And 
fi nally I got the documents. Eventually the trai
n went, but it was ma de
 clear to me  by UNRRA 
and the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short 
of one particular documen
t necessary for the TB 
train. And that, you know, I would be held respon
sible for that, that ev
erything was on course, 
that the TB train would come . It was all arranged
 by the Red Cross, but th
at at the last mi nute, 
there could be a hitch, and that th
at was my responsibility because 
I hadn™t got this docume nt. So 
I reme mber standing on this train, waiting for it 
to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation, 
everybody was happy. The children, the young pe
ople were laughing and singing and looking 
out of the window, and I was terrified that at th
e end of the day there w
ould be a hitch. Some  
official, some army official would come  along 
and say I™m so sorry, but this is not correct, 
there™s -- some thing here is mi ssing. However, 
it went. And I reme mber jumping off t he train 
and think, my God, it™s gone. And looking at th
is train -- and you™ve 
got to picture Hanover 
station without a roof, with th
ings hanging down, and this trai
n wobbling away, and the kids 
hanging out of the window. And I reme mber standi ng there with tears running down my face and 
thinking it™s going to be all 
right, they™re going to go -- I don
™t know what happened to the 
children.  

Q: Let me  take you back -- whoops -- let me  take
 you back to -- to Belsen, and your early days 

there. How ma ny survivors were there, and where 
were they from, what kind of state were they 
in?  Can you tell me  about them?  You™ve taken us
 as far as describing the barracks where they 
were housed. What do you see in terms of -- of -- of the people within those barracks?  

A: The people were ma inly Polish, Roma nian, 
from eastern Europe. There was one remote 

German woman who remained. And 
the reason, of course, was that
 most had been killed much 
earlier on. And she would always talk to me  abou
t the if factor. If my husband had only done 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
29 
 
this, he would not have been taken to the gas cham
bers. If he hadn™t looked in my direction, or if 
he had kept quiet. Or if -- if -- if
 -- and this was always the word 
that people used all the time. If -
- if only. And this preoccupied people so much, if
 only. And so you constantly had to ge -- take 
people back to the fact that it
 was -- it was totally out of 
their hands, that there was an 
inevitability about this. And -- but
 it was such a painful journey to
 take with people. She spoke 
English I reme mber. Mostly Polish, some  were ru
ma  -- well, eastern Eur
ope. And of course, the 
two fa mous people who emerged as leaders of th
e camp eventually, and who I got to know very 
well, was Yosul Rosenzoft, a for mer lawyer, Polish, and Dr. Bi mko, who became  his wife.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape number two, side B of an in
terview with Helen Ba mber. Right, so you were 
telling me  you take Mrs. Forest, to -- to give us 
the name s of the two leader
s. But before that, if 
you can give me  a sense of the kind of condition 
these people were in, how they were dressed, 
how they lived, how they slept, and the kind of e
xperiences with which they were then trying to 
come to terms already, I think. 
A: I reme mb er people sleeping on the floor, and dr
essed in old jackets, trousers. Things were 
handed out, and when we ourselves 
had supplies of clothes, but th
ey were ill-fitting, and people 
wore anything, so people continue d to look some
how ill-kempt, and ill -- 
ill-fitting, ill-dressed, 
ill-cared for. They were emaciated, so very few 
things really fitted them
 well. They looked ill, 
they had a terrible pallor,
 terrible color. But what you have 
to, I think, remember, is that people 
survive because they are survivor
s very often. You know, there™s a 
s -- there™s a reason, there™s a 
certain some thing, X factor, that putting chance 
to one side, where you stand or where you don™t, 
people do survive. Once they™ve -- they™re into th
e role of survivor, they do begin to get a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
30 
 
resilience, and a kind of 
strength, and so people were fiercely 
active, fiercely want
ing to get out, 
fiercely wanting to organize in
 some  way, and fiercely angry. 
But people, how did they look 
when I first saw them? Ill, emaciated, thin hands
. Very thin hands. They had the hands of old 
people like you -- you see some time s  in hospitals wh
ere th-the whole hand di -- hardly resembles 
a hand, where the bones stick out, 
and they used to press their fi
ngers into you very often, in a 
kind of se -- with a sense of urgency they
 would hold you. And you would hold them, if you 
were sensible, and -- and you would rock, because rocking was very much part of the wa y they 

would present. You would sit on the floor some
times with people and hold and rock. And people 
would hold you, and dig their fingers in while they
 told you their story. And I always -- and I™ve 
said in my writings that they spat  out thei r st
ory like a kind of vomit, it came  out in a hissing 

sound. It™s just barely audible, you -- you often 
couldn™t understand whatthey were saying, but 

you knew, without understanding just by the -- some  
words, some  snatches of things. You were 
never alone with anyone. There were always pe ople there. There was always people around, so 
people would often ch-chime  in, and -- and come  
up with some thing. But I -- I was alone with 
the German woman, and I can™t remember the ci
rcumstances, and I™m just hoping -- I don™t think 
it was at ca -- you see, I spent a lot of time in th
e camp of Kownitz, but I™m sure it was Belsen 
because in -- in Kownitz they were ma inly H
ungarian, and in Belsen I think, for some reason, I 
was more alone with her. And she told me  about
 her husband, and it was very pitiful. But people 
soon -- soon began to rese mble some  for m of 
nor mal kind of appearance.
 Their faces would fill 
out, their stomachs woul d protrude because I th
ink it™s part of malnutrition. You don™t suddenly 
become  -- you don™t fill out properly, you fill out 
chaotically. And particul arly with the younger 
people. But I reme mber some  young adolescent b
oys, and they looked like any young kids from 
a village, with caps and ill-fitti
ng clothes, and they didn™t look
 so unusual after some  months. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
31 
 
People recovered, and they recovere
d slowly. Those that were going 
to die, died very quickly, I 
believe. 
Q: On that subject -- on that 
subject, the day you arrive, I be
lieve -- you know, th-there was -- 
there was such a sense of desper
ation still, that a woma n took he
r own life, and her child™s. Do 
you recall that? 

A: Yes, I do. The day I arrived in Belsen, we were
 told that a woman who™
d had a -- a child by, I 
think a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and he
r -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her 
child, and they both died. And 
it -- it was horrifi c. And it was 
-- yes, it™s strange I di dn™t 
reme mber that at first, that that  was so importa
nt. But we all block. And there was a sense of real 
horror and upset amongst the workers about this woma n. 

Q: How did it affect the other survivors? 

A: That I don™t know. I only know how
 it affected the workers, and it was -- it felt like a sense of 
failure, like it does with all care
rs, who care for people who take 
their lives. You feel you have 
failed them. So, there™s a kind of so-called r
easonably norma l response 
in a totally, totally 
abnormal situation.  

Q: In terms of food and me dicine and equipmen
t and so on, how well were you equipped to help 
these people? 

A: I think we often lacked supplies. I reme mb
er on one occasion we were waiting for so me  
supplies to come , and eventually 
a -- a truck arrived at the -- ou
r headquarters. And it turned out 

to be a traveling synagogue and didn™t have th
e supplies that we wanted. And those of us who 

were less religiously inclined had quite a lot to
 say at the time, incl
udingmyself. We  were 
furious, and very upset. Oh, so mu
ch for what people feel you n
eed. It was -- I mean, a lot of 
supplies were comi ng in. ORT was very good. Th
ere were other American organizations 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
32 
 
bringing in supplies. And we ourse
lves did have supplies and we 
did ma n the hospital in Belsen, 
which was run, I think, by one of the nun™s sist
ers, who was a m -- a nurse. Henry Lunzer -- 
Q: So this is a -- this is a sister of your boss? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the hospi
tal there. And I reme mber her showing us around 
the hospital, and the hospital was called the Glen Hughes Hospita
l after Brigadier Glen Hughes 
who reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was,
 I believe, a rema rkable man. What can I say 

about the hospital?  I think I lear
ned -- I learned so much in th
ose months I was in Germany. You 
know, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what
 was going on in that hospital -- you™ve got to 
reme mber that nurses of the 30™s and the 40™s we
re brought up to believe in everything being 
absolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have 
sheets that are tightly 
drawn, to have -- you know, 
to have everything clean, and -- and cared for. A
nd again, it™s like all the bureaucracies -- I me an, 
I do understand it, it -- it is -- the 
idea of chaos is always fright
ening, but chaos can some ti me s be 
quite healing. And what I thought wa s very good, 
was when I watched people helping their own 
people. By that I mean ma ybe relatives, ma ybe friends, ma ybe a child, 
some body fe eding their -- 

their relative, or their friend. And 
it would be a mess. The cl -- the 
cl -- the -- the bed would be in 
a mess. Their trembling hands would never quite 
reach the mouth appropri
ately and there would 
be me ss all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- butthere was a to -- it was noise, and there was 

bustle, and there was a sense of activ
ity. And I think that  that  is fa
r safer for healing than the kind 
of -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of
 -- you being prepared for death with your white 
sheet tucked tightly round you, 
and I™m si mplifying some thing very much, and I must be 
forgiven for that, because  there is a pl ace for order in a hospi tal scene, and ma ny people do ask 

for it. But there ar e situations in which chaos 
and care can ma tch, and can bring about solutions. 
And when I started, ma ny years later with a grou
p of other mothers, an association for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
33 
 
welfare of children in hospitals, so that mother s could go into hospital with their small children 
under the age of five, I reme mbered all the time  th
e lessons that I™d learne
d in that hospital. And 
that is that some times it™s better for a bit of
 chaos if you are looking af
ter your child, and the 
sense of care and love is there. And there will 
be people who will disa gree with me  about this, 
and people who will reme mber everything about Be
lsen di fferently than I do, but I wa s only 20 
years old, impressionable, taking ever
ything in and not all of it ma y be as coherent as the listener 
would wish.  

Q: We ll, you say you were very young, as indeed 
you were, but in -- how could you, at such a 
very young age, absorb and ma ke an
y sense of what you were seeing? 
A: I think I was all -- you know, I don™t reme mbe r  
approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but 
I don™t reme mber a proper childhood. I reme mbe r
 being a very grown-up child. Not willingly, 
but some how forced upon me  by circumstances. I 
was always very serious, although I enjoyed 
fun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in Germany 
with my comr a des. We had lots of fun and 
laughter, like one does in extreme situations. But 
-- I mean, you -- it -- it™s difficult now to -- to 
be honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, 
or have I some how taken it in and absorbed it 
slowly over the years?  And there ma y be some thi
ng in the latter, because every time  I look back, 
I realize of things I learned, and ma ybe I didn™
t realize at the time I 
was learning about human 
relationships, about everything, a
nd about hatred, about love, ever
ything was encapsulated in that 
experience.  

Q: Given the kind of desperate phys
ical and psychological state of 
-- of these survivors, how did 
you begin?  Can you recall how you 
began trying to reach out to them, and help them? 

A: I can™t reme mber trying. I reme mber moving into
 the blocks and talking, and being a ve -- and 
sort of sitting on the ground. I mean, don™t mi
sunderstand, as people became stronger, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
34 
 
became angry, and you, being the carer, you being th
e provider, would often become the target 
for people™s anger, because you coul
d not provide the answers. So I 
think with the creativity that 
existed amongst some  of the survivors, and our ow
n need to feed into that, we were able to 
support some  of the things that were going on. For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and 
somebody c alled Norbert Fallheim, who later comm
itted suicide, formed a committee within the 
camp. They were representatives of the camp. We 
were the next sort of go-between between 
ourselves, be tween them, and UNRRA, and the military government. So we would naturally, 

whilst we were supporting what they were doi
ng, at the same time we would become the 
recipients of much of their anger. And I can reme
mber sitting in an old 
Merck car that had been 
commandeered from some where by some body, sort of
 closely packed in at the back with 
Norbert, and Yosul, and some body else, and mys e lf
 desperately trying to 
take notes with Henry 
and some body else in the front, while they were 
raging and ranting and ve
ry angry indeed. About 
-- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a 
relief because it was human, and it was life. 
And it was such a relief from the desperate,
 dejected, huddled figures. You know, some ti me s 
when I used to go -- when I first started to go 
into the rooms, people didn™t look like huma n 
beings, they -- th-they we re all ki
nd of like a huddle of cl
othes sitting there. It
 was quite horrible, 
because it was dim, and y -- and you couldn™t alwa
ys identify nu -- it -- and here were people 
shouting about what they wanted, and being ve
ry angry, with us, w
ith them, with everybody. 
And in a way, although I felt very 
vulnerable some ti me s, at bei
ng shouted at, I also was a go-
between in my fa miliar fa milial pattern, between 
them and my own hierarchy, between them and 

Henry. And so they would come  to me, either in 
Eilshausen, and they would ask me  to negotiate, 
and they would complain about Henry, and then
 they would complain to Henry about UNRRA, 

and then all the rest of it and so
 on. Because of course, what they 
wanted more than anything else 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
35 
 
was freedom, and they hadn™t got it. I mean, I™m
 ma king it sound as if I understood it all, and I 
don™t think I did. I think it™
s only with hindsight that I can ta
lk about anger as being some thing 
very positive. But it™s some thi
ng that ma kes you feel alive, wh
ereas when I used to see the 
people huddled, and I thought to my self
, I wonder if they™re going to di
e, th -- I™d -- I -- I think I 
just felt that I could do more in
 that situation of vigor and ange
r, and -- and vision, because they 
had a vision of what they wanted.  
Q: Which was? 

A: We ll, they wanted out. They wanted out 
of the camp. Some people wanted -- you know, this 
is a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, be
cause people talk about 
the formation of an 
organization that was -- whose ai
m was Palestine. Now, my recoll
ection is that there were ma ny 
people who wanted to go, for one reason or anot
her, either to Ameri
ca or to England. And 
obviously they couldn™t. 

Q: When you say obviously, can
 you explain that for us? 
A: We ll, it™s very little diffe
rent than it is now, really. I don™
t think you could get into England 
unless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, 
and sponsored quite energetically. You had to 
be able to provide for that person completely 
and absolutely. And one or two people did go from 
Kownitz. So I don™t remember anybody going from -- from Belsen. And others wanted to go to 

America, and I™m sure some did. And some peop
le did come  to -- to England. But there were 
ma ny -- the ma jority didn™t and couldn™t. And I 
think it was only with th
e realization that nobody 
really wanted them again -- yet again. That no -- 
that the doors were not 
opening generously to -- 
and -- and -- and with -- what™s th
e word I want?  Like, with countries
 joining together
 in order to 
provide a solution for this group of people, who rema ined there, some  of t hem, until 1950. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
36 
 
Which is a very long time from 1945. So it™s not 
surprising that people became more militant and 
more determined that  Palestine was th
e only solution for the Jewish people.  
Q: Again, let me  take you back a little bit, becau
se I think a lot of us 
don™t know quite as much 
and -- and we  need filling in. I™m
 very interested to know what 
a typical day was, or a typical 
week in your life out there, or 
in the life of the team. What you 
did in the office, what you did 
with the people, you know, in a fairly basic kind of way.  
A: I mean, I was very involved with Henry in tr
yi ng to negotiate for better facilities within the 
camps. And withi -- and within gr
oups where Jewish people had -- 
had -- had come  a nd were in 
need of provision, and -- and -- and support. And 
so we would be writing and Henry would be 

meeting -- I mi ght accompany him with others, to 
try to negotiate, either
 with UNRRA or with 
the British governme nt for better
 facilities here, and better facili
ties there. I would write endless 
letters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount 
of time screaming down th
e telephone because the 
telephones did exist, but it was almos t  impossi
ble to hear anyone, and you would spend hours 
trying to get some body, and it ma de such a differen
ce because otherwise you just had to get in a 
truck and go. So I would do norma l secretarial 
work in support for Henry. I would accompany 
him, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was c
oncerned -- were concerne
d. But I spent a lot of 
time -- and this again is some thing I™d -- I can™
t put -- I can™t be too correct about, because I 
simply can™t reme mber. I went to Kownitz camp 
-- what happened at Kownitz was that -- and I 
can™t even tell you exac
tly where it is -- 
Q: This was a camp for wo me n, was  it? 
A: There were ma inly wome n, there were some
 men, but there were li 
-- a large number of 
Hungarians -- Hungarian woma n, but there were so
me  young me n. And we got a telegram to the 
unit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that
 -- that they were desp
erate, that they had no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
37 
 
provisions, no means of support, th
at -- that there was this camp, 
and there was nothing and they 
were desperate. 
Q: How ma ny people were th
ere, do you recollect? 
A: A lot. I don™t reme mber the number, and I ca
n™t tell you the number. It was quite -- it must 
have been about 600 - 700 people, I think. And I 
went there, but I don™t reme mber with whom. I 
went there with some body and we had a meeting in
 a room, up some  stairs, wooden stairs with -- 
there were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold. 

Q: Which winter was this? 

A: The first. I just wish one could reme mber 
mo re, who was with me . And I went back with 

whoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplie
s, for acknowledgeme nt that this camp existed 
and needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other 
facilities, as well as our own. But then 
they got -- was a -- was a situation in which I 
would go very frequently to the camp, and that 
doesn™t seem to be acknowledged by anybody now
 who can reme mber. Neither Henry, nor 
Allison Wa rd, with -- who was our personnel officer, a
nd who is still alive. 
Both are still alive. 
Neither have a clear recollection of Kownitz. Allis
on said yes, she reme mbers that I used to go 
off frequently with this former 
Hungarian Je wish Brigade leader, 
and that we would work there. 
But I can™t tell you how it was, whether I elected to
 g -- I know I must have elected to go because 
I was there so often. I was there for their first 
Pesach, which we had in the open. And I reme mber 
we arrived late, and they were qui
te fed up with us for being late, 
and they had to 
carry me across 
all the tables, and there was enormo
us hilarity about that, as I wa
s carried aloft across tables. And 
I got to know them very well. But they need
ed a lot of support, they were young women, who 
were very beautiful ma ny of them, who were ve
ry si -- very vulnerable. Who the person I was 

working with was very anxious to protect from
 the sexual advances of
 any soldiers. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
38 
 
reme mber a very moving discussion in which he s
poke, and said -- and I was so touched that in 
the mi ddle of Ger many, in the mi ddle of all this mess, a camp that was mud, you were up to your 
ankles in mu d at the time -- or later, because 
it was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the 
wome n and told them, you must 
preserve yourself. You™ve been 
preserved for a reason. I can 
reme mber it to this day. You™ve been preser
ved for a reason. Don™t 
destroy yourselves, don™t 
capitulate to me n who fi nd you beau
tiful and who want to give you 
chocolate, and who want to 
try to he lp you, and ma ybe not help you. He was 
really telling them, you have a sexuality which 
you™re only just realizing because in the camp your
 hair was cut, you didn™t have your periods, 
you now do -- but he didn™t say this in so ma ny wo
rds. But he gave this very moving talk to 
them. I was so touched by this, and thought it was 
so wonderful that -- that
 we should be talking 
there, preserve yourselves some how as a woma
n, and as women. And it™s important. And then 
we danced, I reme mber we did lots of dancing. 

Q: What kind of dancing was that? 
A: Oh, anything, we just danced. We danced the hor
a a lot, and -- hora, and 
then we -- there were 
people who knew various variations that I™d never s een before, that were fascinating. And lots of 
songs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- 
it was full of life. I me t  two of the woma n 
later, here. And they™d ma naged 
some how. But  i-it™s -- I-I don™t 
know what we were trying to do 
there, we were trying and -- i-i-it was such 
a unsupported group of people, and it was so 

primitive. I think it was a very primitive camp. 
Some body onc e described it as a very good one. I 
thought it was very primitive. I reme mber there 
was a sort of wooden toilet, you know, one of 
these open jobs, and sort of ju
st by the side of the camp, and you know, you had to have people 
on guard when you went in there, because there™
s no way you could fasten the door, and it was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
39 
 
it -- that place was cold and primitive. We got s
upplies in, we got learning
 material in. We did 
some thing. We did our best.

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an 
interview with Helen Bamber. Now, the survivors 
who you dealt with were now officially 
displaced persons. Wh at did that mean? 
A: Well, fi rst of all it me ant that  as far as th
e officials were concerne
d, the word survivor or 
victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and th
e word displaced persons, which is a sort of 
anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a us
eful shield, just as we
 use the word asylum 
seekers today, so the word displaced persons, an
d then DPs, even worse, was used. So the 
compassion that was there at th
e very beginning, and the sense of
 outrage when the camp was 
liberated, had gone, in my view. And the DPs, disp
laced persons were seen as a problem, number 
one. So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a 

nuisance, a --  a problem. They were vocal, they™d
 become articulate, th
ey had their committee, 
they were dema nding, they wanted rights. What 
wa -- what rights did th
ey want?  They wanted 
rights within the camp, as far as I reme mber. They
 wanted rights of travel. They wanted to be 
able to move about Germany. And that was very di
fficult because as far as I reme mber, and this -
- this can be corrected by others
, the people in the camps were not 
allowed to leave or to travel 
without special permit. Now, in the early 
days, ma ny of the young displaced persons we nt 
particularly, as I reme mb er, to Poland, ma inly to
 try to find their relatives. They went to their 
old, former home s to find their relatives. When 
t hey got there, they were set upon by the local 
people, who drove them out, and some  killings t
ook place, and some  assaults took place. And the 

people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoe
s and bleeding feet, would return back into 
Germany, a nd back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp. I use barbed wire as a -- as 

a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarce
ration. So their options we
re very limited. If they 
wanted to find their relatives -- and this was at th
e beginning, for the first year or so was the most 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
41 
 
important as I reme mber it, was the finding of relatives. Now we had set up a search bureau in 
Belsen. And that was one of thethings that one of the volunteers
 in our unit had trained at doing 
was to set up a search bureau. People who woul
d come  to the camp, again presumably illegally 
because they would come  and there was no way in which they should ha ve been able to enter or 

to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper,
 rolled up paper. It was probably cigarette paper, 
with the names of relatives on it,
 asking has anybody seen or hear
d of so and so?  And the name s 
would be on these little bits of pa
per. And they would give them to you, or they would give them 
to anybody. They would just hand them out
, and you would -- you would do your best. 
Q: How did the search bureau work? 

A: I™m not well acquainted with th
e search bureau. The search bur
eau presumably tried to ma rry 
people through the camp, or through other means, 
relatives of the name d person, so -- on the 
piece of paper. So, it di d it™s job. Wh ether it di d it 
adequately, I can™t say. It was primitive. But in 
some  cases people were reunited. There were other 
search bureaus that were established as time 
went on. I™m not quite sure if the Re d Cross was 
not involved also in tr
ying to reunite people. 
That also can be confirmed. I have -- 
you -- you know, I have a very fragmented, 
compart mentalized me mory of this particular pe
riod of my life. So I can
™t really speak with 
authority about the organization of
 the search bureaus. I know th
at there were several, I know 
that we had one in the camp. A
nd I know that people came search
ing for their relatives, handing 
bits of paper to each ot her in order to 
see whether some body r e me mbered some body. I t  was 
pathetic, and very sad. Full of pathos, very sad to watch.  

Q: You™d been -- you™d been speaking earlier ab
out the options availabl
e to people now -- once 
they were DPs, if you like. Can you tell us a litt
le more about the options they were seeking?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
42 
 
You said that some  of them wanted to go home
, for example, to Poland, and what became  of 
them. 
A: Mm. 

Q: But what about those who -- who ha
d their eyes set on other countries? 
A: I think my me mory is of people wanting to 
come , many of them, to En
gland or to America. 
There was no means by which they really coul
d si mply ask to come. I™m not sure if the 
American quota system was operating in the way 
that it norma lly does. In other words, so ma ny 
from -- you know, that you™re on th
e German quota list, or the 
Roma nian, Hungarian, or Polish. 
But what I do know was that it wasn™t possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really. 

Some  people did, and they™re very proud of it,
 and they say it as though anybody could have 
done it, but they must for give me , I don™t believe 
it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise 
they would have done it. I-It™s -- 
it was hard for people, they c
ouldn™t get out, and they couldn™t 
go anywhere. They couldn™t go -- the Iron Curtain 
had already fallen, they couldn™t go to the Iron 
Curtain countries. They knew that they would be 
badly treated if they did. They knew what was 
going on by returnees. And so what were their options
?  To find their relatives, to -- but then, as 
the months passed people realized that nothing 
had happened. Perhaps they had found a relative, 
perhaps they™d accepted that that was it, that nobo
dy was alive. Or they live d in hopes, but they 
still wanted to get out. Outside the camps, of 
course, the Germans were beginning to mi ngle, to 
fraterni ze with British, American and other soldie
rs in the various zones. And this came  very 
hard to the inmates, the fact that they were 
still displaced persons wh
ile something else was 
going on outside. I believe then that a hardeni
ng of attitude s took place, 
a realization for ma ny 
that they were not wanted. That was the feeli
ng, that nobody really wanted to open their doors. I 
mean, ma ny people returned to Holland, some  
ma ybe to France. But on the whole, people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
43 
 
rema ined, and they didn™t want t
o. So, I think that is when -- a
nd again I must be forgiven by tha 
-- by those people who see it differen
tly, but I begi n that  i --  I believe that  it was then that the 
idea of becomi ng more Zionist, wanting to go to 
Palestine is the only solution for their problem. 
And I believe it was then that 
it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mi ssion. So 
people began to learn Hebrew if they didn™t al
ready know it. They beca
me more militant . There 
were the illegal transportations to 
-- to cross frontiers to try to 
get illegally to Palestine one way 
or another. And of course, ma ny pe ople perished on the way.  
Q: What did you know at the time 
about these illegal journeys? 
A: What did I know?  Well, everybody knew that
 it was happening. It was no secret. An 
organization grew, an organization of -- I™m not 
giving it a name, I don™t know it -- whether there 
ever was a name, but you know, with all these situ
ations of -- of despair and need, a militancy 
grows, an urgency grows. People ar
e not going to stay in that situ
ation forever. And historically 
this has alwa ys happened. It™s happening now w
ith the Kurds, and it™s happened elsewhere. 
People want some thing for themselves, and they 
want fr eedom and safe ty. And people will, if 
they™re not allowed to negotiate for it, they wi
ll try to take it. A
nd so people began to go 
illegally, and cross frontiers il
legally. And transports from the camps were organized. 
Q: From yours as well, among the people you knew?  
That™s to say, inma tes held at Be lsen also. 
A: And Kownitz, yes. Mm.  

Q: So how would you find out about this?  Woul
d you turn up one day and there™d be fewer 
people?  Or did it work other ways? 

A: I know -- I know relatively lit
tle about the transpor
ts. They were small. People didn™t go in 
large numbers, to my knowledge. I reme mber one pa
rticular incident, let 
me concentrate on that. 
We were told at the -- our headquarters that -- 
or we found out some how, 
that there we re a group 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
44 
 
of I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in 
a British army post. And I can™t tell you where it 
was, but it wa s a group of DPs who had been found 
crossing the Dutch frontie
r illegally and they 
were now being held, and had been held for ma ny
 months in this camp. And in this camp, when 
we eventually got there, we found that the cam
p was also a holding place for infa mous war 
criminals and Germans who had -- 
who -- with a -- with 
a poor reputation. So I went with the 
leader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lo
rry, and I think, too, we ha
d another lorry with -- 
or truck, large truck, which w
ould house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance 
which was intended for the pregnant woma n who 
was quite near term. So I think we probably 
had a nurse with us. I can™t reme mbe r  that, but
 I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be 
necessary or prudent to just have
 the ambulance. So I think we must
 have had a nurse with us. So 
there were several of us, and when we got to 
the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the 
ma in kind of open area, bef -- we -- we  came into an open space. On the left of us was this open 

camp site with barbed wire, in which the Germ
ans were standing or pacing. And there was one 
woma n, whose name  I think has been given as Irm
a Grace, but I™m not sure if it was she, and I 
will check that for the record, but it was defi n
itely a woman of -- who was well-known for her 
crimes. And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we
 were to get out and go and negotiate with 
the British post, the inmates, the German inmates 
started to chant. They realized that we had 
come  for, in inverted commas, the Jews. And they
 began to chant, and it wasn™t a very friendly 
chant. Some thing similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out w
ith the Jews, but nasty stuff. I can™t reme mber 
the exact words, but it was very ominous, and 
the whole scene was very ominous. And as we 
began to -- as we negotiated, and we received 
the people, and they were wa lking towards the 
truck, and we  were loading them onto the trucks, 
the chanting got louder, 
and louder, and louder. 
And my colleague said, ﬁStart them singing, get 
them singing.ﬂ And so they started to sing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
45 
 
Q: The -- the Jews who you -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- had come  to collect. 

A: Mm. And so, rather remi niscent of that 
film with Ingrid Bergma n and -- you know, that 
fa mous ﬁCa sablancaﬂ thing, but not dissimilar ma
y I tell you, because the singing got louder and 
louder, and the chanting got louder, and it wa
s extremely unpleasant. And I™ve never -- that 
scene, I -- I will never forget, be
cause of it™s ominous nature, it™s pure, unadulterated hatred that 
was present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi -amused laid back attitude of the British 

soldiers from whom we  were collecting the fo
rmer inma tes. And they were from Kownitz, I 

think. And we took them in the trucks, and th
e pr oud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the 
ambulance, and was mo st affronted. So the ambu
lance, it trailed behind, and we had our two 
trucks and we  took them back. And it -- th-t
here was some  exuberance I reme mber, some  -- 

some  sense of release, relief. And there wa
s a lot of singing, but people were tired, and 
exhausted, and it was a long drive, I reme mber
. And I reme mber that there was a boy, young 
boy, and we held out our arms to help the people 
out of the -- out of th
e lorry, and he refused 
that, and he jumped down. And I -- I talked to h
im for a little while. And when we got back into 

the truck -- because people needed to relieve 
themselves, I think we had food as well, we got 
back into the truck, this young boy, 
as we dropped him off i n -- in the compound in Kownitz said 
to me, ﬁYou will reme mber me. Re me mber me.ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁYes, I™ll reme mber you.ﬂ And I 
stayed in Kownitz, I -- I don™t know where or how,
 I can™t reme mber where 
I slept. And I asked, 
I think, several days later wher
e the group was, and I was told 
that they™d gone off again, and 
that this time they had crossed 
the frontier and they had got awa
y. So not, I think, the pregnant 
lady. I don™t reme mber. Well, it ma y have been, but 
whatever, they had gone. So yes, there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
46 
 
transports, and they behaved as all people do in 
these situations, with incr edible determination 
and much courage. Many died. Some  were shot cr
ossing the frontiers as well. But more than that, 
I don™t -- I can™t say. 
Q: Just pause it there for a second. I wanted to talk a little bit now about
 how the camp at Belsen 
functioned, how it was organized and -- and wh
at people did all day whe -- when you first 
arrived. 

A: You know, I™m not quite -- to be honest, I™m not
 quite clear about what people did all day as 
far as the inma tes were concerned. 
I think -- it wasn™t a camp that 
I worked in day in and day out. 
My impression is that they did very little at 
the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so 
debilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an 
actual activity. I believe that the more orthodox 
gathered and prayed, and went about their devo
tions. And I™m sure there was some  a c tivity, but 
there was very little struct ure to the camp as
 I reme mber it. It was the emergence of Yosul 

Rosenzoft and Norbert Fallhei m, and the estab
lishment of a committee ma ny months later. And 
also with the presence of ORT providing worksh
ops. And I do have, and I w-will have to donate 
it at some time, a s mall pot, a small vase from
 some  metal that was found some where, which 
some one ga ve me , which is one of the f -- one th
e early products of the er -- ORT workshop. So 
people began to occupy themselves. They began 
to form into their pol
itical and religious 
groupings. The theater wa s establ ished and became 
one of the liveliest  and the most exciting 
exponents of resilience and life in the camp.  

Q: Tell me  about it. 

A: We ll, the theater woul d star t with, nearly alwa
ys as far as I reme mber, with a very raw just 
sort of exposure on the stage of
 the destruction of a fa mily. The scene would start with the 
mother, father and children sitting round a table, 
very familiar tabl e. And you can see that they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
47 
 
were joyful, that they were e
ngaged with each other, arguing, 
discussing, etcetera. And then you 
heard the marching toward the doo
r that would open on the family in which the Germans would 
come . And you saw the fa mily being beaten, be
ing taken, you hear th
e screams, you s ee the 
mother being dragged away. The whole scene of 
a fa mily being broken up in front of you was 
played time and time and time again. And it would 
be received in absolute
 silence. It  was the 
homa ge to the fa mily, to the destroyed fa mily. 
Whether it was a for m of mourning, I™m not sure. 
It could -- it could have been. It 
was -- or was it more a kind of 
expression of outrage, letting the 
world know this is what happened 
to my fa mily. I think it was mo
re that than mourning, because 
it™s my view that ma ny Holocaust survivors have
 never found the way to mourn such grotesque 
happenings as those that they witn
essed and were part of. So I thi
nk it™s probably to do with -- to 
do with exposure of what happened, and wantin
g the world and everybody 
to see it. And as the 
military government and -- and offi cials fr om UNRRA
 were often invited to th -- these concerts. 
Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some
 occasions, it™s not surprising that they would 
want to say this. This is, or was my family, a
nd this is how it was for me . It was incredibly 
intimate, and terrible to watch. And there was 
never any applause, there was only silence. But 
then there would be other things taking part. I don™
t remembe r  all of it, but I remembe r  that very 
often there would be a kind of cabaret element to 
it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or 
Polish, or whatever, really ma king fun of, and 
poking the finger at the 
establishment of the 
British rule, the British co mmand and the British z
one, the at titude to the camp. There would be -
- and it would be received with
 roars of laughter and applause
, and at the end of which, of 
course, everybody stood up and applauded, including 
the front row of officials from the army, 

who™d hadn™t understood a word of this cabaret. 
And I think the cabaret 
was done very much in 
the old-fashioned kind of really sort of Ger man 
style cabaret. You know, it wa
s ironic, it was -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
48 
 
was -- it™s meaning was very, very
 clear, and I believe it was ver
y, very clever. I didn™t always 
understand it all. And so the theater was ve
ry important, the hospital was important, the 
workshops, the committees. The constant badgering for different indi viduals to move or do 
some thing, to go some where within Germany fo
r whatever reason. Other than that, I cannot 
really -- I cannot really re
me mber other activities.  
Q: How abo ut the -- the newspape
r, wasn™t there a newspaper? 
A: Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course th
ere was a newspaper. Yes, there was a newspaper 
produced with again, factual and ironic comments a
bout the life of the DP, and the life of Belsen. 
And -- and so on. No, th -- th -- there™s a newspaper, 
I wish -- I wonder if there™s ever any of this 

left. I™ve never seen anything. So much was of
 the mo ment, and you don™t think in terms of 
history, which one should. Anyway, that™s 
how it was, as far as I reme mb er. 
Q: So it went from being a rather deso
late, to ma ybe quite a spirited place. 
A: Yes, it was. It had its spirit, 
it had its resilience, it had its sens
e of life. And I think that there 
was a group of younger people there who were going to
 survive at all costs. Some how survival 
and strength meant a great deal to
 them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea 
of Palestine as their solution. Whether the Pales
tine or the Israel that 
we see now would have 
been different, I believe it mi ght, 
but others don™t agree with me
. Had Britain and America taken 
people more readily and quickly, and quickly solved
 this question of people remaining within the 
camp that once abused them -- I mean, there™s noth
ing much worse than that, really. Pretty awful 
stuff. I don™t know. It ma y be a very simplistic 
way of looking at a very
 complex problem. But 
the sense of not being wa nted, and the sense of 
not being a victim again, was prevalent. And I 
have seen it elsewhere.

End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is tape number three, side B of an in
terview with Helen Bamber. To what extent do you 
think the work that you did, and the work that your
 colleagues did contributed to this resurgence 
of the huma n spirit, if you™
d like, in the camp?  The one 
that you™ve just described.  
A: I find it difficult to ma ke claims, I always do. I th
ink that we  were part of it. We  were part of 
the res -- I don™t want to use the word resurrec
tion, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac -- 
some thing of the restoration of the huma n spir
it. We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the 
people, some thing of the spirit. Okay, they were
 angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed 
and performed, and -- and -- and were quite 
rema rkable in ma ny ways. I™m not taking 
responsibility for it. I believe we 
played a small part in it, and 
I believe that we offered support 
and resources, and that probably, as is so often th
e case, we were responsible more for particular 
individuals being helped than we
 were for the kind of global pict
ure, if you know what I me an. I 
mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of
 the German woma n I spoke to, and who I had 
quite a lot to do with, 
and I think that without ma king t
oo ma ny claims , our relationship was 
helpful. The fact that she could speak to me  about
 her husband, about her losses, and the fact that 
-- no, I just feel some how I can think of individu
als that were helped by my colleagues, and on 
occasion by myself, but I don™t want to ma ke 
too ma ny clai ms about what we achieved. 
Q: All right, well to 
get away from the claims, let me 
ask you about this. Beginning, let™s say 
with a good -- 
A: I think the hospital was important. I think -- I 
-- I had less to do with th
e hospital, but I think 
the hospital was valuable, and did a 
great deal for the individuals. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
50 
 
Q: Tell me  in what way. I mean, you™ve spoken aboutone aspect of the hospita
l, the fact that it 
was open to friends and relatives and so on. 
A: Mm, mm. 

Q: But it -- when you say it was particularly
 important, in what way do you mean that? 
A: Well, it was -- i-it was a place for recover
y. And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it 
wasn™t a German hospital. It wasn™t a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by 

Jewish people helping Jewish people. And I thi
nk that was very important because you are very 

vulnerable when you are helpless. And they 
had been helpless ma ny, many times, helpless 
victims at the me rcy of others cruelty and lack
 of care, and lack of
 anything. And I think 
whatever else we did or didn™t 
do, we  did operate it well. I believe
 that. So I think that was a 
plus. And I -- I can think of ma ny individuals
 who were helped along by some thing. But if you 
ask me  were we responsible for all that renewa
l of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don™t think we 
were responsible. I think it came fr om the resilien
ce of survivors. Had we not been there it mi ght 
have been more difficult, let me  put it that 
way. That mi ght be the fairest way to put it. 
Q: Can you describe in -- in 
greater detail how your relations
hip with people developed, how 
when you arrived on this very desolate scene,
 how you ma de  contact with people, how they 

reacted to you, and how, if at al
l, you -- you ma naged to establish some  kind of dialog with them, 
and -- and draw them out. Tell me  how that pr
ocess happened there in 
Belsen, as opposed to 

since. 

A: I think in the early days -- I 
mean, this sounds very, again, rath
er trite, I think, and simplistic, 
but what I found was very important was to say 
very little, but to take some body™s hand. I -- I 
found that very important, and I some ti me s find
 it important in my present day work. When 
there™s nothing to say and the situation is so te
rrible, all you can do is to take some body™s hand 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
51 
 
and stroke it and hold it and tr
y to indicate through 
your touch that there is a communi cation. So 
you don™t begin with words, you begin with touch, 
and that™s all. And sometimes I would just 
walk away. And they mi ght call me  back or I mi ght
 just walk away and come  another day. But it 
would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in th
e very early days, because pe ople were so 
exhausted, that to take so
me body™s hand and to hold it was 
a way of you -- you, as a person, 
trying to give strength, as it 
were, to the other person. So th
at was all I could do some times. 
Words came later.  
Q: And wha t  happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when 

you didn™t have a language in common with 
the people you were nonetheless communicating 
with? 

A: Some times people would simply come  out wi th 
a whole story in explosions. I™ve -- I™ve said 
before like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something. So that it would come  out stacat -- come  

out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in 
a coherent way. And I would some ti me s say either in 
German -- and I would always apologize for sp
eaking Germa n, and I w
ould try to bring in 
Yiddish words that I™d learned, as much as I 
coul d, if I couldn™t understand some body, because 

there would be other people there, and often peopl
e would sort of want to come  to help you to 
understand the story. So that 
again is a for m of communi
cation. The fact that you don™t 
understand puts you in a less powerful position, ther
efore they have the power to inform you. 
Without them, I can™t understand that person. So th
at™s always a very useful way of looking at 
things, to accept your powerlessn
ess, and let them have the pow
er to inform you. And I would 
ask for help from the m. 

Q: You™ve said, I believe, that some times you we re
 -- they were angry with you, they didn™t want 

your sympathy, they wanted simply some body t o work out their anger on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
52 
 
A: Yes, well then, I mean, this is some thing you 
get in all -- with most 
survivors and something 
that you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my
 present day work. People are angry because they 
are helpless and frightened and 
-- and they can™t see a way out. 
And you just have to let them 
shout and be angry. There™s nothing else 
you can do. You don™t walk away from it. 
Q: Did you have at the time  any sense that 
you were achieving some thing?  I mean, when you 
went back to the requisitioned 
house at the end of the day, after 
a visit to Belsen, what did you 
do?  Did you get blind drunk, did you hide under 
the sheets? What -- what did you do?  How on 
earth did you live with this stuff day after 
day, and what sense did you have, had it been 
worthwhile, the day you just spent? 

A: I never talked to anyone about
 it, and I think that was one of 
the failures in the organization. It 
was born of it™s time when organizat
ions were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things 
that they couldn™t achieve. So th
at organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more 
difficult the outside circumstances, the more
 institutions call upon the solutions for the 
institutions rather than for the people they™re ther
e to help. So we would look at, if we me t in the 
evening, we would talk about the di
fficulties of transport, or the di
fficulties of a car being stolen, 
or an accident. But we wouldn™t talk about how I 
felt, or anybody else felt. So there wa sn™t much 
of that. Wha t  there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that 

house, that requisitioned house. We  would sing, we
 would read poetry, we  would read aloud to 
each other. We would put on various -- we ha
d one boy who was an extremely good mi mi c, and 
Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of th
e day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of 
performi ng on the stage which was 
quite unique, and a li
ttle bit what can I say?  Little bit 
arrogant and pompous. And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. And so he would 

sing and perfor m and we  would all act out so
me thing. Or we would dance. Now we would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
53 
 
dance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this. We ™d put on some thing or 
other. We had some very sentimental It
alian songs, you know -- you know, I can™t even 
reme mber them now, but they were very sent
imental, and we would all swoon, we would listen 
to music. So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, 

in the evenings, but we didn™t ta
lk about our feelings. So my 
ma in relief would be laughing at 
some body taking off Richard Talbor 
or somebody else for that matter. And we™d have all those 
sort of activities, which was fun. 

Q: Privately, did you despair of wh
at you were seeing day after day? 
A: No, I didn™t despair at the time. When I cam
e back to Britain, when I came back to London, I 
went through a very difficult phase
, one that I haven™t experienced 
since. I -- I can™
t explain what 
it was, it was an inability to work with what I™d seen. I was absolutely terr ified of a recurrence of 

that kind of happening, I was terrified of it. A
nd I was sure that it was going to happen again. 
And I don™t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. And I used to go to the cinema  and sit and 
watch film after film after film. And I had traditio
nal, classical panic att
acks, when I would feel 
overwhelmed with fear. So a lot 
of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when 
I had come  home . And it was partly fostered by 
the lack of interest 
by anybody around me  in 
understanding or listening to what 
I had to say. That was very di
fficult for me. I™d learned a lot 
of negotiating skills in Ge rmany, and in my fa mil
y, but I hadn™t learned how to deal, and I still 
find it hard to deal with a bystander, to d
eal with people who know and don™t know, who don™t 
want to hear, and who didn™t want
 to hear. And I couldn™t bear it.
 I came back to a country that 
was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of 
meat they were going to get that week, and 
any effort I ma de on my part 
to communicate what I™d seen, even when I was asked to give 
official talks about it -- I reme mb
er going to the east end and talk
ing in a theater there to people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
54 
 
I was actually asking for money, and that ma y have
 had some thing to do w
ith it, but money for 
the relief --  the Jewish Relief Unit. I still do that
 sort of thing. And I had to ask for mo ney and 
say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I me t with 
cold, angry stares as mu ch as to say, don™t 
you think we™ve suffered enough, we™ve heard enough?  
But I think it™s part
ly guilt. I know now 
that it™s guilt. And so that before you start, you ha
ve to try to reduce that sense of guilt with 
people that they couldn™t and didn™t want to do a
nything or know anything at the time. And they 
certainly didn™t then. And I found that the hardest 
thing of all. So I despaired when I came  back. 
I despaired when I came  back, and I was really very 
low, the lowest I™ ve ever been in my life, I 
think. Well, almost. 
Q: What was it that ma de you decide to come  
back and ma de you decide to come  back at a 
particular time?  Maybe you could remi nd us of the 
date as well. What -- what was that one single 
thing or that -- were you just completely
 overloaded with what you™d seen and done? 
A: No, I™d been ill, I™d been in hospi tal. I™d b
een involved in an accident  which I™d ha d what they 
thought was concussion, I was quite unwell. And 
I came back on leave and it was decided for 
me , I didn™t decide. I had wanted to go back. In f
act, I was dying to go back, I couldn™t wait to go 
back. And I think that partly my 
despair i-in this --  in comi ng b
ack, was due to the fact that I 
couldn™t go back there, and that I 
felt more at home there than I 
did here. And I felt more at ease 
there, and with myself. And that was very hard for me . 

Q: Why did you feel mor e  at ease? 

A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I 
was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and 
what I was doing it for. And even if we were fail
ing, or not doing a fantastic
 job, at least we were 
trying to do some thing. Whereas I came  back to
 nothingness, to people who didn™t want to know 
about it. And that was -- that was awful. So I 
really found my self in th
e wilderness when I came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
55 
 
back. And the fact that it -- th
at things had changed, new people,
 new order had been set up out 
there, Henry was no longer there. It meant that it
 was difficult for me  to go back. And in a way 
that was quite difficult for me , that whole scene. 
Q: We ll, I mean it was two things as well, wasn™t
 it? It was unfinished business, and you hadn™t 
really said your goodbyes if you 
were expecting to go back. 
A: I hadn™t said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn™t -- 
I™d finished the TB train. I mean, that was a 
job, that was a project that lasted ma ny mont
hs, and that was the one thing I did achieve, 
whatever else I did or didn™t achieve, I achieved th
at. So I felt quite good a
bout the bi -- the -- the 
-- the -- the fact that I™d gota -- managed to get a group of 
young children and adolescents to 
Switzerland for treatment of their TB. That wa
s quite an achieveme nt, you know, bearing in 
mi nd the difficulties that we were faced wit
h. So I felt good about that, but I didn™t feel good 
about leaving unfinished business, not saying go
odbye. I felt very, very bad. It was bad, very 
di ffi cul t  for me.  
Q: So when you came home  and you found this
 kind of uncomprehending response, what 
happened?  What -- wh
at happened to you? 
A: We ll, there was a period which I really can ba
rely reme mb er, in which I wandered about, as I 
say, going to the cinema . Sort of not knowing quite wh
at to do. I eventually went to work for the 
Jewish Refugee Committee in their emigration depa
rtme nt. And then finally, from there, I was 
asked to work with the Co mmittee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camp s, working 
with a group of young children and 
adolescents who™d been brought 
to this country whilst I was 
still in Germany. They came  here in 1945. They were young people, orphans who™d been in 

Auschwitz, and been in the slave labor camps. 
And because of my background I was asked if I 

would be a caseworker with that organization. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
56 
 
Q: We ll, w-why don™t you tell me  a 
little bit about that organizati
on and the -- and the work that 
you did?  We ™re taking a little pause.
 Yes. Before we move on to 
look in some  depth at the work 
you did when you came back to England, give me 
an assessment of what you, your organization, 
and people like you achieved in Germany a fter the war. 
A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lun
zer, with his or --  with his sort of military 
organization, in setting up an admi nistration, a
nd an office that actually
 could operate within 
German, and particularly in the British zone, 
but not only in the Brit
ish zone, in terms of 
provision, in terms of ne gotiation with British mi
litary governme nt for the needs of different 
individuals and groups, I think that
 we would have achieved very l
ittle. I think we -- and I think 
that his support of the need for children to go 
to the sanatoria in -- 
in Switzerland was -- was 
good, and he gave me  all the support -- moral suppor
t that I needed in or
der to do that. I think 
that he was mi sjudged, as is often the case, 
where you have a small -- where you have small 
resources, and you have a base in another countr
y of purse holders and trustees, who have the 
reputation of the organization at heart, and want
 it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to 
have a view, a good overview of wha t  Henry Lunzer
 was trying to achieve there. So there were 
inevitable, and there always are,
 I think, tensions, even in or
ganizations today, which are well 
known, whe r e the ba se is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the 

world. It™s very difficult to keep those comm
unications clean and good. 
And it certainly was a 
handicap in -- in the --  in the 
Jewish Relief Unit at that  time. 

Q: Let™s move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do. 

A: But I -- I did want to -- but 
I do -- I do really, at this point,
 want to pay tribute to Henry 
Lunzer because I think that he was a courag
eous negotiator and was very knowledgeable. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
57 
 
knew Ger many well, he spoke German well. He 
could speak to military government. I think, you 
know, some body needs to say he did a bl
oody good job, because he did. Thank you. 
Q: Okay. Let™s talk then about the work th
at you did once you came back to London after the 
war.  
A: Once I™d recovered my equilibrium, which took 
some  months before I could actually face the 
world, really, I was appointed a case worker to
 the Committee for the Care of Children from 
Concentration Ca mps. I think I me ntioned this a 
little earlier. It was an
 organization sponsored 
and financed by the Central British Fund, and hada board of trustees. And it™s director was a 

practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, 
who I™d admi red very much. Who had been the 
director of a type of [indeciphe
rable] institution in Germany, until he  himself, as a Jew, was 
expelled and taken to a concentration camp befor e
 the war started, and finally released, and who 
came to this country, or at least came to Britain 
as a refugee. And he was, as I say, a practicing 
psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of 
the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, 
and of working with people who in turn were tryi
ng to care for what was considered to be a -- in 
the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, 
a difficult or complex group of young people. I came 
back in 1947, in the early mont
hs of 1947, so the children had al
ready been, and -- or -- and 
adolescents had already gone throug
h a kind of preliminary phase of
 being in special home s, out 
of London, where they were helped with language a
nd ma ny different things. By the time  I got to 
work with them, they we re looking at schooli
ng, at advance study, at a
pprenticeships, and some  
kind of future. Again, we were looking at a 
very vigorous, articulat
e, dema nding group of young 
people, competitive. Now, they were very di
fferent in some  ways from the people that I 

reme mbered from the camps. Their survival, as -- 
as had the people in the camps, but let™s just 
ma ke this kind of -- let™s ma rk this difference.
 The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
58 
 
people I was working with had survived the daily 
selections for work, or for the gas chamber, 
through their ability to maintain strength, to 
ma intain totally focused on their survival, nobody 

else™s but their survival. Although 
of course, some  were concerned 
with fr iends and siblings, but 
basically focused on their own bodily survival. They
 had to prove their strength, their capacity to 
work another day. Silence, not reacting to anything, 
however cruel, was part of their survival. So 
in dealing, in communicating with this group of 
people, one always had to have in one™s mi nd 
that that was how they survived. And th
ere was never going to 
be an easy, immediate 
communication and trust. There couldn™t be. Nobody in
 their life really coul
d be trusted for some  
time. So it was very important  to fi nd a way to
 build that trust, and to build a for m of 
communication that took into account their need 
for their own private space. And this is quite 
important because I found it very 
important in working with them 
that -- for example, I -- I spoke 
about taking some one™s hand in the camps. Wh
at I found with the young people to be very 
important was to pi -- allow a space between you
 and them. A kind of actual, physical space so 
that -- and I -- I could never quite
 put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important 
to ma intain that space, but it was. And I believe 
that it gave them a sense of their own kind of 
power base, their own sense of identity 
and strength. And I did not invade it. 
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
59 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is tape number four, side A of an inte
rview with Helen Bamber. 
You were talking about 
the space and your approach -- you we re talking 
about your approach to these young people, and 
how actually they needed precisely the opposite ki
nd of approach to the 
people you dealt with in 
Belsen. 
A: Yes, yes. And a -- a -- this space was -- was 
a recognition, a kind of in
stinctive recognition. It 
wasn™t some thing that I could put
 down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he 

was a guidance to me  in ma ny of the cases that 
I had. But I just -- it was so mething that I just 
sensed as very, very important. Now, my job 
then was to try and help the young people to be 
placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possi
bly creative, or would certainly gi ve them some  

sense of solid -- solidity. However, I have to say 
at some  stage that we were not encour aged to, 
so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they 
had experienced. And I do feel that there was, in 
some  way, a denial of need he
re. I believe that these young peopl
e -- and I™ve sa
id earlier I 
believe, in the tapes, that peopl
e did not have the opportunity, the 
ability or the resources in time 
to mourn their dead. And it™s not only to mourn thei r dead in the sense of their dying, but in the 

sense of their grotesque ma nner of dying. Andto mourn the grotesque is more compl e x, and 

needs skill. I don™t think that we
 had thought that through, and even 
if we did fumble towards an 
understanding that their inner worl
d was not being addressed, such
 was the -- the kind of culture 
of the day, that the idea that -- 
you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by 
war, where the me ssage to everyone was to -- to ju
st put the past to rest and let™s move  forward. 
A new world is born, the war is over, let™s get on
 with life. That was the me ssage of the day. 

Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about th
eir inner fears and their nightmares. They were 
not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. 
All the war films that came out were really like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
60 
 
some thing out of Peter Pa n, they were so -- so ba
nal, and so sentimental. So sentimental a -- you 
know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. It wasn™t por
trayed at that stage w
ith all it™s horror. And 
to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the 
open was felt not to be appropriate. Now, I™m not 
saying that there wasn™t some  attention to thei
r inner world. I believe there was some . The Anna 
Freud clinic was involved in some  way in obs
erving the young people. But I don™t believe that 
we dealt with the need to mourn. And when I look
 today at the -- at the older people as they are 
now, me n in their 60™s and 70™s, wome n, and I look at
 their relationships a
nd the next generation, 
I don™t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as
 we could have done. It™s
 easy to say that in 
hindsight. I believe that 
we did quite a lot of good, and most
 of the young people have, in social 
terms, flourished, ma de good, ma rried, had ch
ildren. But if you observe them, and their 
relationships, and their long -- I 
don™t want to use the word lo
ng-suffering, but in their very 
supportive wives, and you speak to
 the children, not everything is 
as good as it looks. So, I me an, 
I went about my task of trying to help people, 
young people t -- into jobs
. I negotiated yet again 
with schools, and colleges, and institutions 
and most in a -- most unpleasant sometime s, 
landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and empl
oyers. It wa s a hard time . It had been a hard 
war, and people were tough, and employers were
 tough. And the fact that these young people 
were -- I was just going to say asylum seek
ers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust 
survivors, it did not call for compassion. So
me  were good, some  were very good. And ma ny 
people worked well with the young people, and o
ffered much. And there was a club, and there 
were facilities and mone y was sought for special 
needs. But I would have liked to have dealt 
better with some  of the strange things that
 happened. I had a young ma n, for example, who™d 
been -- who had TB. And I went every week to 
see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood. 
He was a delightful young ma n from Poland. We spoke
 together, we talked about his needs. We 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
61 
 
talked about all kinds of things. But one day 
when I went there, after ma ny, ma ny mo nths of 
treatment, and he was doing very we ll, he wasn™t
 there. And I was quite upset and I asked the 

nurses what had happened. And they said he ju
st got up and went. No
w he -- we don™t know 
what happened, and I still to this day don™t know 
exactly what the process was, whether it was 
long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or 
what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very 
enquiring of me  as to why I hadn™t noticed a pr
oblem. But such was the defense of this young 
ma n that he could converse week after week, and 
I could become  quite close, and we could talk 

about quite intimate things, about sexuality, abou
t the di fficulty of being ill, about a possible 
girlfriend, all these things we could talk about. 
But some how he could, ne
vertheless, just g-get 
up and go. So it™s that kind of thing where the 
defenses have been developed through crisis, 
through extremis, through the most
 terrible losses and catastrophes,
 and genocide. Wh ere people 
have built defenses that are no 
longer so good in every day life, and do not ma ke for a bsolute 
intimacy and trust. And this is what I thi
nk happened with this young ma n. We  ca -- w-we 
ma naged to speak about it later, but it happened, a
nd it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a 

failure. 

Q: One boy out of ma ny, then. 

A: We ll, I mean, he succeeded. He got better, he
 had a girlfriend in the 
end. No, I don™t think it 
was a total failure. He was one boy out of ma
ny. There was another boy I took, a very, very 
brilliant boy, who I™ve la
t -- just recently found as a profe
ssor of che mistry in Canada, in 
university in Canada. I looked fo
r ma ny months, years in fact to
 find him.  He had TB of the 
spine, and I wondered if he™d 
survived. And I -- I took him befo
re a group of headmasters in a 
special school in north London, because he was 
a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a 
particular standard of education for him. In 
comi ng before the headmasters -- it was a team of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
62 
 
headma sters, to judge this young ma n. I had to, of 
course, to say that the 
-- he had lost quite a 
number of years of his education. Br
illiant as he was, he had lost 
years. And I explained that he™d 
been in this camp, and that camp, slave labor, etcet
era, etcetera, Auschwitz. And then the chai r of 
the headma sters turned to me  and said, ﬁBut didn
™t they give them books t o read? ﬂ  And I was so 
aghast. I couldn™t believe it, a
nd I couldn™t find anything to say. 
Sufficient to say that the young 
ma n was taken into that particular
 school. But I™ve never forgotten 
that, and it™s an indication of 
society™s capacity to deny what is taking place.
 But there was also denial amongst the Jewish 

community when I came  back from Germany, as  to
 what had happened to our brethren, to our 
brothers and sisters. And denial
 can exist in every population. 
Q: Why did it exist among Br
itain™s Jewish population? 
A: I think it was partly guilt, that
 s -- si -- a -- si --  thei r own 
survival  and other people had not 
survived. I -- I shared that. I shared that 
feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you 
know, when other people did not, and you know, just 
by the luck of the draw
, really. Many of my  
relatives in Poland indeed had not survived. So -- 
my father™s relatives. So I think it was partly 
guilt, but it™s also deni al. If you deny some thing, you don™t have to do anyt hing about it. If you 

recognize some thing, you have to do some thing. 
And you know, I™m faced with this every day, 
in my every day life now. It™s the deni al of so
ciety to accept that certain pe ople have suffered 
sufficiently to require our atte
ntion. And I think that™s what
 I felt when I came back from 
Germany. It wasn™t just the experience of the camps, of the people, 
of the ghastliness, of 
everything I™d seen and heard. It was the fact 
that when I came  back I couldn™t get anybody to 
even unders -- want to -- want to
 understand what had happened. And 
so this really is my -- my 
most urgent plea. It™s not only 
about reme mbering the past, it™s 
about preserving the future. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
63 
 
we can only preserve the future if we recognize wh
at we are doing to each other, and what that 
means for the victims, and what we need to 
do if we™re to be a compassionate society. 
Q: Little pause here to allow us to -- 
A: Oh, I thought that was the fi -- 

Q: When did you finish working with the boy 
survivors, and -- and 
what did you do next? 
A: I worked for ma ny years, about eight years 
on and off wit h the -- the boy survivors. Of 
course, there were girls,
 we always called them the boys, but th
ere were girls. And I continue to 
stay in touch with them. When I say I continue 
to work with them, the work finished probably 
after a -- a few years, I think, after about four y
ears, but I continued to se
e them, and continued to 
work with them for a number of y
ears after that. And I still see th
em, particularly one or two of 
them. But I then went on to do some hospital j
obs, social work jobs 
in hospitals. I joined 
Amnesty in 1961. And I -- I just do want to say 
some thing about why I joined Amne sty, I know 
it™s not relevant, except to do with hatred. It was 
very easy to hate one pa
rticular nation, and one 
particular group of people. And I™d enjoyed, if I can 
use that word, or indulged in that hatred for 
ma ny years, particularly as my husba nd also had 
been a s -- a survivor 
in ma ny ways, and seen 
his family destroyed in grotesque
 wa ys, and I -- at least his --
 certainly his father, who was 
beaten to death in the house in which they we
re on the Kristallnacht. So living with his 
depression and his mi sery over the death of his 
mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek 
concentration camp, I certainly nur
sed my hatred of the German
s for many years. But it was 
when I began to realize that torture and other huma n rights viol
ations were going on in so ma ny 
countries in the world. That the Fr ench were to
rturing the Algerians, th
at other people were 
torturing. That you could not put --
 you could not put a frontier up a
nd say this is where it begins, 
and this is where it ends. And I™m not  ma king, a
nd I™m not comparing one genocide, or one cat -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
64 
 
catastrophe with another. The Holocaust will alwa ys
 rema in the most terrible of genocides of the 
20
th
 century. But I still feel that  we mustn™t close 
our eyes to other terrib
le disast ers, such as 
we™ve seen recently, for example, in Rwanda. 
So I joined Amnesty [indecipherabl e] in the 
spirits, you know, with the idea that
 I can™t nurse this forever. 
I have to accept and have to 
understand that violence and pers
ecution goes on in ma ny different forms, and I needed to 
understand it better. My work in 
Amnesty went on for ma ny years. 
I -- I helped to form the first 
me dical group in the British sect
ion of Amnesty International,
 taking testimony and documenting 
evidence of tortur e and hu man right
s violations from rela
tives and survivors who™d come  to this 
country, and in going on mi ssions abroad for Am
nesty. And it was comi ng out of that -- that 
work, knowing that we could document, and we
 could take testimony, and we could supply 
evidence of huma n rights violati
ons to organizations and instit
utions concerned with huma n 
rights, incl uding the United Natio
ns, but that we weren™t actually
 treating the survivors. That 
ma de me  fee l  we weren™t really fulfilling our 
task. And as people were beginning to ask us to 
take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from ma ny different countries who 

look -- resided in this country, and who™d been to
rtured and violated in 
ma ny different ways, and 
lost sometimes, all their me mbers of their family, 
that ma de me  feel that we needed to move on. 
We established as an independent charity, th
e me dical foundation for the care of victims of 
torture at the end of 1985. And we had a vision, 
and visions are difficult to hold onto. And the 
vision was to combine human rights, 
and the care of the victims. In 
other words, to take heed of 
people™s protection, their huma n rights,
 to be part of that. If nece
ssary even to be advocates for 
that, which is not easy for therap
ists. But also to look at the me
dical, psychological and social 
needs of the people who came from the -- to 
the me dical foundation. We ™ve treated over 35,000 
people, from over 91 different c
ountries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
65 
 
consulting room every day, is filled with horren
dous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation, 
of hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from a
ll over the world. And I suppos
e really, that is the 
beginning and end, in some  ways 
of my story. I™m doing what I se
t out to do. I know I can™t save 
everybody. I know that my own skills are limited. We
™re an organization with no -- insufficient 
resources to meet the needs of everyone. I believe we
 live in as hostile an environment as -- or at 
least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 
30™s. People are not welc
omed, people are deported 
back to the countries which tortured them. Eur
ope an countries are closi
ng the doors, we have a 
fortress Europe. We  don™t look for 
good solutions. We  didn™t in 
the 30™s and we don™t now. So 
really, my work is again about 
huma n rights, and the care of th
e individual, and the individual™s 
fa mily. And that can be very rewarding wor
k, even if it can also be quite distressing. 
Q: Is there a thread that dire
ctly links your experiences at --
 of Belsen with the Medical 
Foundation? 

A: I don™t think I would have established the Me
dical Foundation, and worked so long in the 
Medical Foundation if I hadn™t be
en to Belsen. What I learned 
in Belsen was about a kind of 
suffering that we have never really begun to unde
rstand, about loss, about 
grotesque death, about 
the need to mourn. About -- about de
spair and the desire to die. I 
learned all of these things in 
Belsen, but I also learned a
bout the resilience, and some th
ing about the huma n spirit and 
people™s capacity to survive, and people™s capa
city to overcome, if you ar e able to resource 
something within them. And that™s
 what I™ve learned. I didn™t unders
tand how to resource it for 
many years. But with time, you are able to res
ource people™s skills, pe ople™s -- you are able to 

retrieve something of who that person was. And th
at™s very, very important. You are able to deal, 
or to try to come  to terms with grotesque deat
h. To find ways of burying the dead that are very 
unusual. And this we™ve had to do in the Medical 
Foundation. It™s about an holistic approach to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
66 
 
trauma , and to loss, using me dicine, using psyc
hology, but also using very adaptive measures. 
You can™t deal -- you know, you can™t bring a very traditional fo
rm of therapy very often to 
people from different -- fr om certain dif -- from 
different cultures, from different beliefs in 
healing. You™ll have to listen to
 what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative 
ways of wor king with people, and I can give ma ny 
examples of that, but I 
don™t think that that is 
the purpose of this discussion. 
I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address 
governme nt, it™s home office. It doesn™t always su
cceed, but it tries. It™s
 learned skills of 
negotiation and understanding otherpeople™s difficulties. But how
 you hold the vision, and how 
you deal with continuing -- a continuing lack
 of compassion and understanding, both in the 
public -- or some  of the public, no
t all of the public, we have quite
 a following, but in some  of 
the public, and in some  of govern
me nt, is very difficult to do. 
Q: Now, on a slightly different tack, but not entir
ely, one aspect of the work that you™ve done for 
the Medical Foundation, I believe in
 June 1993, you went to Israel a
nd you testified on behalf of 
a Palestinian prisoner. Could you 
tell me  about that 
whole case, and your involveme nt in it? 
A: I™ll tell you some of it, because
 it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly. I went to Israel 

to take part with a colleague of mi ne who is for mer
ly -- was -- was born in 
Israel , but lives in this 
country and works as a psychologist
. I went to attend a conference 
of the Israeli and Palestinian 
Physicians for Human Rights. The Medical 
Foundation does link to various human r i ghts 

organizations. And because of my background, a
nd because of the backgr ound of my  colleague, 
it seemed ve ry appropriate that 
we should link to some thing that
 sounded as constructive as an 
Israeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benef
it of Huma n Rights. We  knew, and had me t the 
Israeli me mbers of the organization, and the Pa
lestinians. I had known and worked with for 
ma ny years -- that means to say, when I say work
ed with, I mean I™ve communicated with a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
67 
 
profound child psychiatrist from Gaz a  who studied 
in this country, and is working with the Gaza 
community me ntal health team in Gaza. So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the 

conference, which regrettably was on the subj
ect of torture. Tortur
e worl dwide, tort ure 
throughout the world, but torture 
also in Israel. And when I was there, I wa s asked by the 
Physicians for Huma n Rights if I would help th
em in the case of a Palestinian where it had 

become  obvious from the papers that had been
 found of his interrogation, that he had been 
tortured in order -- in order for him to confess,
 whether I will be prepared to help them. And I 
met the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in 
his case before I ma de any decisions. And I was 
very impressed with his integrity, 
and his dignity, and his desire as
 an Israeli to provide fairness 
and justice where he felt it was appropriate. On 
reading the docume nt, it was obvious to me  that 
certain forms of what we would call torture ha d 
taken place. And I agreed, reluctantly ma y I say, 
to, as a visiting director of an or
ganization concerned with torture, to
 take part in a certain aspect 
of his trial. It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed 
with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the 
lawyers request that I acquiesced to this. And 
I produced a docume nt, and I attended the court. 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side B 
Q: This is tape number four, side B,
 of an interview with Helen Bamber. 
A: And so we went -- I went w
ith the -- with the lawyer, the Je
wish lawyer, and my colleague 
who had come  with me  and escort
ed me  from the UK, to Hebrum. It was extremely hot. And we 
had to wait for ma ny hours because the judge wa
s not happy about my giving any evidence in the 
court. And I think that she, quite
 understandably, had to take advi
ce from other authorities before 
she could proceed, and she went on really for ma ny hours before eventually, I was allowed to 

come  into the court, and to give only very re
stricted information. I could not refer to certain 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
68 
 
aspects which they considered I was not qualified
 to refer to. So, my role was rather  a limited 
one. But I could talk about conf
essions under torture, and that
 confessions under torture can 
never be reliable ones, for quite obvious reas
ons. That people will often say some thing in 
extreme discomfort that isn™t necessarily true
. And as torture is uni
versally outlawed, it does 
seem rather inappropriate for any court to take
, to accept a confession th
at actually took place 
under coercion, and under extreme pressure. Before I 
went to the court, I 
sat for some  time in a 
very small, hot flat, without air conditioni ng, to 
see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick, 
smelly, kind of wooly, wool ma terial, army ma te
rial hood. I didn™t have such an exact hood, but I 
had sufficient to give me a feeling of how clau
strophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would 
be. I wasn™t able to adopt the posit
ion that is adopted, that was adopt
ed, and is -- is often used in 
such cases in Israel, where some body is placed on
 a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and 
the chair™s feet are shorter in the front than 
the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and 
exposed to quite a lot of noise, 
loud noise, and you are also in th
is very uncomfortable position, 
sitting on this seat, which has 
a traditional name, which I sh
all reme mber soon, I think if 
anybody were to try that position, they would 
find it extremely uncomfortable, because the 

weight of the body is distributed in such a way 
that there™s enormous pressure on the back, and 
one is in extreme discomfort and fear, and expo
sed to noise. Man also had an injury that had 
been recorded in the notes, but which I was not 
allowed to refer to in the court, which was an 
injury to his nose, which the doc
tor had recorded. Now, I -- it™s diffi cult for me to discuss this 
particular case. It so happens that the case was re
solved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an 
expert in confessions under pe
rs -- under duress, came from 
the Mordsley hospital as an 
independent expert, and gave
 evidence in this case. 
Q: A British hospital, that is. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
69 
 
A: Yes, a British hospital . Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my  
credentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to 
the court, that if they 
were concerned, as they 
said they were, to ascertain wh
ether the ma n had confessed under to
rture, then perhaps the best 
way of doing it was to get some body whose exper
tise could not be denied. And so this was 
agreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, fr
om a  renowned institution, and whose semi nal work 
is in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherab
le] attend the court. And the ma n™s sentence 
was commuted. Is i -- is that the word?  From I th
ink 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the 
-- was what he was convicted -- 
was what he was given on convict
ion. But I think it -- he w -- 
did -- it was then -- 

Q: Reduced, or -- 

A: Reduced to a very short period, and he was re
leased quite soon. It wa
s a very, very difficult 
experience for me . For me , with my  background
, to stand in Israeli court, defending a 
Palestinian, who was there, and who looked extr
emely fearful , and obviously with a -- some  -- 
well, was very hard. But it was much harder 
to do nothing. If had done nothing, I could never 
really have lived with my principles, whic
h is that nobody, under any circumstances should be 
signaled out for torture, and th
at there are other wa ys. If you 
do want information, you have to 
find, with all the ingenuity that 
exists within societies, other wa ys. But you do not torture, you do 
not torture. Torture is such an abominable, deva
stating experience, both to
 those who practice it, 
I believe, in the end, and those on w
ho it is inflicted. It is really th
e most terrible me mory that la -
- that -- that man can have. And the nightmares,
 and the physical pain, 
the sense of one™s own 
betrayal -- the body betrays in torture. The 
body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture. 
And for a civilized country, for civilized people to
 be practicing torture on an individual is 
unforgivable, and cannot be 
condoned under any circumstances.
 And I know there™s a great 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
70 
 
discussion going on about -- at th
e moment about whether torture 
is justified, and others must 
indulge in that. But my views are 
clear, and my experience of worki
ng with survivors is that they 
-- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, 
just as it is with Holocaust  survivor s to 
overcome the effects of torture. And for -- to em
ploy people to torture asyour agents is, I think 
the s -- beginning of a very slippe
ry slope. If you employ people to 
torture, or to apply as they 
say, mi ni mu m pressure, or whatever the phrase is
. It doesn™t ma tter what
 the phrase is. What it 
means is to frighten through physical and psychol
ogical pain into a confession. It™s no way to 
behave for a civilized society. A nd there are people in Israel 
who feel very, very unhappy, very 
uncomfortable about what is going on. And torture 
does exist, I™m afraid, 
in -- in Israel. And I 
have been witness to a number of testimonies 
of people who™ve been 
tortured. And it™s an 
unbearable thought, but I think that we
 have to -- I take heart from 
the fact that there are people 
in Israel who are working very, very hard to fi
nd a way to end this, and who™ve spoken out very 
courageously. I wish there were more. I know that th
ere™s a great deal of f
ear, but I don™t with to 
get into the political  scene in 
Israel. People have elected their 
representatives, and they have 
ma de a decision. I with there was not so much ha
tred against the Palestinians. And I wish the 
Palestinians would not do what 
they are doing. I™ve worked with
 moderate, and intelligent, and 
caring Palestinians and Israelis who come  togeth
er and want to bring ab
out change, and it™s our 
job to help them do that. Not to be defensive abou
t what is going on there, but rather to look for a 
solution, I think, as to how we as
 individuals can assi
st people to bring about change in their 
societies. It is about th
e way people lose it, yes. 
Q: Let me  a sk you a final question. What lesso
ns can you draw so far from your rather 
extraordinary life? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
71 
 
A: I don™t know whether it™s extr
aordinary, I -- I would question th
at. But I -- I think really, my 
concern, what -- what worries me  most is lack of 
compassion. I think it™s so
 easy to turn against 
people, to create scapegoats. I mean, no -- no na
tion, no group of people can be more conscious 
of that than the Jewish people, how easy it is 
for them to be scapegoated. They always have 
been, and they™re still being scapegoated. But we have
 to be careful about this, and we have to be 
informing all the time, people a
bout the need to understand other 
people, to be comp assionate. 
We™re not a compassionate society 
here or anywhere else that I 
can see. And we can do so ma ny 
things. We ™re now going off to Mars, and to th
e moon, and here and there, but we don™t know 
how to maintain compassion. What I saw happen 
in Belsen wa s the dying of compassion. There 
was outrage and compas sion when the camp was liber
ated, but I watched it die. I watched it not 
there when I came back. And when I speak toda
y to people -- I watched it in hospitals where 
children, in my view, were really
 abused, and restrained, when th
ey should not have been. I don™t 
mean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, 
really. Stupidly treated. I just -- I just -- I 
mean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees ca
me  to this country -- we can question why, but 

people came to the airports with teddy bears andpresents, and there was all kinds of support and 

interest in their welfare, particular ly fa milies wi
th small children. People were able to identify 
them. But e ven though they were able to identif
y them, the compassion is gone. If I say today 
that my own governme nt is considering sendi
ng back a Kosovan fa mily, who we feel, for 
reasons of torture and rape and 
various other situations
, really should not go
 back, but should be 
allowed to stay, there won™t be that compa
ssion. The compas sion has died. And so I don™t know 
what ma intains compassion. And I don™t know how to
 help people or to instill compassion in 
people when they™ve lost it. And I 
think that is really the predi
cament for s -- f -- f -- and always 
has been. It™s about being compassionate to the 
people who are so different from you. And even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0482  
72 
 
people you ma y not like very much. I mean, I don™t li
ke all my clients, I 
don™t have to, it™s not 
my job. I reme mber when I was in Germany 
and I said on one occasion to a much more 
experienced colleague, my God, I™m
 s o tired of -- there™s one particular person that drove me  
literally -- drove me  quite ma d, and was very 
dema nding. And he said, ﬁLook, you™re not here to 
like people. You™re not here to 
like them.ﬂ And that™s quite true
. I™m not doing this work because 
I like everybody. And I don™t expect 
to, and it would be foolish for 
me  to do so. But there has to 
be a degree of compassion if we™re to deal with
 the ills of society. I 
don™t know. I [inaudible]. I 
can™t finish it. I™ve come to the end. I 
don™t know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows 
where. I don™t intend it to sound like a sermon. It
™s not like that, but 
I™ve watched compassion 
die so quickly, I just -- it™s 
just a plea for some  kind of 
understanding that isn™t there.
