Our s peaker today is  Nes s e Godin.  And to give you an his tor ic al c ontext for  her  exper ienc es  
we've pr epar ed a br ief audio
-
vis ual intr oduc tion and s ome images.
 
 
This  is, of c our s e, Eur ope.  I'm going to find Nes se's  native c ountry, the c ountr y of Lithuania.  
Nes s e Godin was  born Nes s e Galper in in 1928 in Siauliai, Lithuania, where her par ents  owned a store 
that sold dair y produc ts.  Siauliai was a vibrant J ewis h c ommunity with about 10,000 m embers.
 
 
This  is a pictur e of Nesse when s he was  a young girl.  Is n't she c ute?  She's  st
ill c ute.  You'll 
s ee in a m inute.
 
 
Her e's  a pic tur e of her with her fam ily.  Nes s e is  the one to our  extrem e r ight.  Here s he is .
 
 
And after the Ger man Army invaded Poland in 1939, Nes s e's  fam ily heard s tor ies  from  
r elatives  in Lodz that J ews  wer e being horribly mis treated.  Nes s e and the family found thes e rumors  
har d to believe.
 
By 1941 Germ an tr oops  invaded the Soviet union and oc cupied the Baltic c ountries , 
Lithuania being one of those c ountries  on the Baltic .  In Siauliai, Lithuania, Nes s e and her fa
m ily were 
for c ed to m ove into a ghetto.
 
 
In 1944, as the Soviet Arm y appr oac hed, Nes s e was  deported to 
Stutthof
.  Nesse was 
tr ansferr ed to s everal camp
s 
and forc ed on a s o
-
c alled De
ath Marc h.  On the 10th of Mar c h 1945 she 
was  
liberated 
by Soviet tr oops.  And in 1950, after  s pending five years  in the dis plac ed per s ons  c amp, 
Nes s e em igr ated to the United States .
 
 
Mis s  Nes s e Godin's  experienc e, her  histor y, is one of the m os aic  of exper ienc es  enc ounter ed 
by Holocaust sur vivor s
 a
nd today s he'll s har e that his tory, that experienc e with us .
 
 
Pleas e 
join me in welc om ing Nes s e Godin.

Ric e:  Thank you, Nes s e, for being willing to s hare your
 
First Per s on
 
experienc e 
with us  today.  It's s till br ight in your  eyes ?  Maybe s om ebody in the booth c an help with the light ther e.
 
 
In the m eantim e, c an you tell us what it was  like when you were a young gir l growing up 
before the war years  in Lithuania, in Siauliai?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  Jewis h people lived in Lithuania for m any, m any year s .  T
he king
™
s  daughter 
inv ited J ewis h people to c om e bec aus e Lithuanians  m os tly wer e farmers  and they wanted to learn 

tr ades and bus ines s es .  So that is  Siauliai, Lithuania his tory.
 
 
When I gr ew up in Lithuania, in Siauliai, we had a norm al life until, you know, the Soviets  took  
over .  In 1950, the Soviets  took  over Lithuania.  Not that they wer e inter es ted in Lithuania but just they 

thought they would block  the Nazis  to go far ther  towar ds  the Soviet Union.  So ever ything c hanged at 
that tim e.
 
Of c ours e, when the Soviets  were there, we were not allowed to go to Hebr ew s c hool.  We 
had to go to r egular s c hool.  The ric h people were s ent to Siber ia.
 
 
My m other's store was a tiny little s tor e s o s he c ould s till keep it and m y father worked for  a 
s hoe factory in the 
nor theas t.  Ther e wer e m aking boots and s hoes and stuff like that.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And then s uddenly the Germ ans invaded the Soviet Union and c am e into 
Lithuania.
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I tell you how it happened.  Bec aus e when the Soviets  c am e,
 
m y m other 
alr eady knew from the World War and s he s uggested that we s hould run in the bas ement to hide 

bec aus e maybe bombs will fall and the s hooting.  So we actually, befor e the Soviets  c am e in, we were 
in the bas em ent but nothing happened.  Now, all of a s udden, m y mother  s ays , again, we all have
 
to
 
go 
in the bas em ent bec ause it looks like the Nazis  are c oming.
 
Sometim es wr ong to s ay the Germ ans, 
although they c alled them s elves  Germ ans in thos e days .  But the leadership, the Hitler  and the Nazis .
 
So we didn't know how long we would be ther e, a little food, a little water .  It was  quiet.  So we went 

bac k  into our houses and thought that we c ould do like we had befor e.  But all of this  was  c hanged.
 

The first thing they did, they r an through the c ity grabbin
g J ewis h m en and boys .  That's  when all the 
killing started.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  You r em ember at that point, ver y s hortly after the Nazis cam e, they killed 
about 1,000 young men and boys , and m en, in your  town.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  The few killings  was  they c hose the leaders  of the c omm unity bec aus e they thought if 
we won't have the leaders , we won't have anybody to give us  advic e what to do, whatever.
 

3 
 
 
And don't forget
, i
n thos e days  there was  no televis ion.  Ver y few people had r adios .  So we 
r eally didn't know what was  going on.
 
As you m entioned in the intr oduc tion, we had a cous in that c am e 
fr om  Lodz, Poland, and was  telling what was  happening there.  So we r eally didn't pay too muc h 
attention, es pec ially with the childr en, our  par ents didn't want us 
to worry.
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  How old wer e you at the tim e?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  At that tim e I was  13 years  old.
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And when they s hot the men in your  c omm unity, do you rem em ber  that day?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  I r eally  don't 
r em ember.
 
> > Patric ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Ok .
 
> > Ness e Godin:  But I tell you, I know about it.  But as a c hild, my parents  really didn't
 
--
 
the par
ents  
didn't want the childr en to worr y.  And we r eally did not know what happened to thes e people that they 

grabb
ed and pulled away.  But if we have a few m inutes, I'll tell you exac tly how I find out about it.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Ok .
 
> > Ness e Godin:  As a told you, my m other had a little stor e where s he sold m ilk , butter , and c hees e.  
A nd the farm ers  c am e to 
deliver  the m erc handis e.  We didn't have r efrigerator s or freezers .  If the store 
was  c los ed, they c am e to the hous e.  My br others , one s even years  older, one five year s  older, and 

m e.  And the far m er s wer e telling m y par ents
 
--
 
I c ouldn't really hear fr om
 
far away.  I s aw them  doing 
like this .  So I c am e c loser.  And that's when I hear d what the farmers s aid they were killing the people 
that they took  away, were killed.  She s aid they didn't c are who they buried whether  they wer e still alive 
or  dead.  They
 
s aid the ear th over  the s o
-
c alled graves  moved for m any days .  This  is when m y parents  
taught m e and told me what was  happening with the wor ld. 
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  And how did things  c hange for  J ews  in your  c omm unity onc e the Nazis  wer e 
there, aft
er this  initial violenc e? Wer e you wear ing a yellow s tar ?  Were there r es tr ic tions
? 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I'll tell you, the first thing that we had to do was  wear  the yellow s tar s.  I don't 

think
 
--
 
I took  along a few vis uals .  I always  have s ome vis uals  that are there.
 
You s ee both kinds  of 
m arker s .  There wer e mor e than J ews .  There were differ ent people, too.  But I shar e what happened to 

the J ewis h people.
 
 
Many tim es  people s ay
, C
ouldn't you jus t take it off?  I was  a blond little girl with blue eye
s, as 
you s aw in the pic tur e.  Yes , I c ould have but the neighbor s ays , go, ahead, get them.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  So your neighbor, even if you r emoved that J ewis h s tar, your neighbor  knew 
you wer e J ewis h.
 
> > Ness e Godin:  That's right.  I don't want
 
to s ay a show but we have a plac e wher e they tell what the 
neighbor s did.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  The tem por ar y exhibition in our hous e c alled 
ﬁ
Som e Wer e Neighbor s .
ﬂ 
> > Ness e Godin:  Some helped, ver y few, but m os t of them jus t let it go.
 
> > Patr icia H
eberer
-
Ric e:  Right.  And s o were ther e other r estrictions  besides  the s tar?
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, you c ouldn't go to s c hool anymore.  The par ents  couldn't have bus ines s.  My 
father was  s till allowed to wor k  in the factor y bec aus e the Nazis  wanted to have
 
s hoes  and boots  s o he 
s till worked ther e.
 
It really was  a big c hange.  But we c ould s till stay in our homes .
 
 
Then one day all of a s udden we are told that a changes ar e going to be m ade, a ghetto is  
going to be.  Now, a little bit I knew about the ghetto
 
bec aus e of the c ous in that c ame fr om Poland.  But 
I r eally didn't understand that it's not jus t s om ething, it's  a jail.
 
So in my town, two s ec tions , s urr ounded 
with bar bed
-
wir e. Who was  guar ding the ghetto?  The Lithuania polic e
, t
he sam e polic emen that 
I was  
told as  a little gir l if I get los t, I s hould go for  help
 
I had to be afraid of.
 
 
One day my m other s aid, well, the Nazi offic er s  ar e going to c om e to the hous e; we have to 
line up. We don't know what they will do her e whether they will s teal s om e jewelry or m oney.  We 
r eally didn't know yet what was  happening.
 
S o they c am e
 
with a
 
young Lithuania gir l that knew how to 
wr ite German.  And we lined up in a r ow.  And thes e evil people, the Nazis , told the young gir l, "Write a 

c ertifi
c ate for eac h of the 
par ents . 
Write a c ertific ate that they ar e going to
 
ghetto for  both of the boys . 
Nothing for the kid,
ﬂ 
pointing on me.
 

4 
 
 
Can you im agine how I felt at 13?  What's  going to happen?  My par ents  really didn't tell m e 
m uc h.  The kids now watch televis ion, their
 
favor ite s how.  They know the news .  Thos e days  we didn't.
 
 
So why thes e evil people were ins ide, in the bedroom  taking things, my mother appr oac hed 
this  Lithuanian gir l and she s aid to her, "Here is  some m oney.  Wr ite a c ertific ate for  m y little girl.  S
ave 
her  life."  The gir l didn't say anything.  She didn't ans wer .  And when the com mittee, they c alled 
them s elves , left the house and the girl with them, our  par ents quickly looked at thos e c er tific ates .  

There were two for  m y par ents, two for my brothers ,
 
and one c ertific ate, a blank c ertific ate.  The girl 
was  s mart.  She wanted to s ave m y life but s he didn't put it on in c as e they c atc h her.  So m y parents  

c ould put in m y nam e and that's how I got into the ghetto.  The people that did not get into the ghe
tto 
were taken to another fores t and killed.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  Can you tell us what it was  like in the ghetto?
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, the life in the ghetto, it was  not like you were at hom e, you know.  Ther e was  
por tions  of food, already r ules  and regulations .  Some people that went to work were lined up at the 
gate.  They let them  go to work .  But if you were young or old, they took  them  and killed them .
 
 
My par ents , bec aus e I was  young, and my brothers  and they went to wor k  s o what my father 
did, he m ade a little hiding plac e for  m e behind a c abinet.  He m ade a fals e entr anc e, like.  And when 
the J ewis h polic e us ed to r un and s ay
, 
"Danger, danger ," I us ed to r un in there and stay until there was  
by police that us ed to s ay 777 or s om ething, a code, that it's  over with.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  At a c ertain point ther e was  a s o
-
c alled c hildren's  ac tion.  I'm going to 
explain to the audienc e what that is
. I
n m any ghetto and als o in c onc entr ation c am ps  and killing 
c enter s, the Nazi offic ials  r egularly had a c hildren's  ac tion to call c hildren from that ghetto to murder 

them, to call them from  the ghetto or  fr om the c onc entr ation cam p.  There was  one in your  ghetto, was  
ther e not?
 

> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  Yes .
 
You s ee, s till, I was n't too s afe hiding in this little plac e.  So my par ents , 
again, found s omebody that they c ould pay off s o they would let me have a job outs ide of the ghetto.  

At that point I think I was  already 14 or a little bit more.
 
I was  wor king in a hos pital.  A young man, a 
J ewis h m an, was  c hopping the wood and the gir ls  had to go into eac h r oom , in the oven, and put in the 

wood.  There was  no c entr al heating at that tim e.
 
 
So that morning when I cam e back  to go to wor k , they told us we c annot go to work .  So we 
r un back  into the little room.  And now my m other s ays  don't wor ry
; e
verything will be ok
; t
hey'll go to 
wor k
; there is  a mis under s tanding.
 
 
A little bit later we were lined up and told all the working people c an go to work.  So the young 
people that wor ked in the hos pital, all day long we wondered what was  happening bec aus e we s aw 

s om e trucks  outside before we left.  We c ame back .  We hear d c r ies
, c
ries from out
 
ins ide of the ghetto.  
They were walking. The wom en that wer e there told us  exac tly what happened that day.  Ges tapo, 
the 
evil people, and Uk r ainians joined the evil c aus e, they r an through the ghetto, running and finding every 
s ingle plac e to drive them  to the right and to the left to the right and to the left.  All the c hildr en through 
the age of 14.  It m is s ed me by jus t a little bit.  500 elder ly and s ick and a few hundr ed healthy and 

s tr ong, men and women that were off on work  but the Nazis  took them away bec aus e they would fight 
them back .
 
 
We did not know then wher e they were taken to.  After  the war  we found out that this trans port 
was  taken to Aus c hwitz c onc entration c amp.  They were not even given num bers.  They wer e taken 
s tr aight into the gas  c hamber s and their bodies  wer e bur ned in crematoriums.  That's  c alled the 
c hildren's  s election.  On that s election, I los
t m y father.  He was one of the healthy and the strong.  His  
day off fr om wor k.  He happened to be in the ghetto.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e:  As  the Ar my appr oac hed then, the Soviet Army, the Arm y that c ould actually 
fr ee you and fr eed you in the end, as  they approac hed, the inhabitants , s urviving inhabitants of the 
ghetto, wer e s ent to a c onc entration c am p near  Gdans k .
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, it took  like a year  later.  Again they s aid we didn't need two ghettos .  So they 

put us all in the s ame plac e.  And they s aid we are going to move, you ar e not going to be her e 

anym or e, take along your  prec ious  things what you c an c ar ry
, j
ust what you c an c ar r y.  
 

5 
 
 
Sometimes you see docudr am as and all kinds of s tories but it didn't work  that way.
 
They put 
us  again in th
os e tr ains.  You know when you go through the exhibit, you see one of thos e tr ains.  Can 
you im agine people with their  little luggage they are holding on or whatever?  It was  a terr ible journey.  
We really wer e not told wher e we wer e going.
 
We thought, you
 
know, m aybe they ar e moving us to 
Poland to a bigger  ghetto or s omething.  But they br ought us to a c onc entration c amp c alled Stutthof.  

This  is wher e Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian people were thrown, overflow of Aus c hwitz.
 
 
As  s oon as we arr ived ther e, t hey told us  to leave our baggages  on the s ide bec aus e they 
figured maybe we have s om e prec ious  things  that they didn't want us to have it.  The next thing, we 

went into another  room.  We had to undr ess  naked.  And then we were given a dr es s , a pair  of 
unde
rpants and a pair of s hoes .  Then we had to s ign in at the desk .  No m or e nam es .  You bec ame a 
num ber.  54,015.  That was  m y num ber.  No tattoo, p
ainted on my little dres s .  J ust in Aus c hwitz they 

did the tattoos. 
T
hen they as s igned you
 
--
 
at that point alr eady m y m other went one way, I went another 
way
, a
 
plac e in the c oncentration c amp.
 
 
Ever y m or ning they lined you up.  And they looked you over.  If you wer e too young or  too old 
looking, they took  you away not to be s een again.
 
> > Patr ic ia Heberer
-
Ric e: 
 
You had
 
--
 
s orr y.  Did you want to c ontinue?
 
> > Ness e Godin:  One day a wom an s aid to me, "Little girl, they are going to kill you here.
  
And you 
look s o little, s o young, you know?
ﬂ
  
At that time I was  16.  I s aid, "What c an I do?"  They s aid, 
w
ell, this
 
woman s aid, you know, they are lining up people for s lave labor
; i
f you c ould s neak in that line up the 
hill but you have to r em em ber, you have to wr ap your s elf in straw s o you would look healthier , pinc h 

your  c heeks  s o you will look  s tr onger, and try to run in ther e and m aybe, maybe you'll s ur vive.
 
So I 
lis tened to the woman.  And I s nuck  in.  I stood on m y tiptoes  like s he s aid.  I pinc hed m y c heeks .  I had 

wr apped with s traw.  I s uc c eeded to leave the c onc entr ation c am p to labor  c amp.
 
> > Patr icia Heber e
r-
Ric e:  And what was  it like in that labor c am p?  Can you just tell us  what that was  
like? 
 
> > Ness e Godin:  Yes.  Well, you know, we wer e just in women's  c amp.  And our job ther e were 
digging c one
-
s haped holes  in the gr ound for enem y tanks to fall in.  Y
ou s
ee
, a tank  c an go up the hill, 
down the hill, but if it falls in, down, it c annot.  So this  was  our  job.  Ever y m or ning we had to get up.  
They gave us  a little bit
 
--
 
they c alled it c offee.  It was  br own water
 
--
 a 
tiny little piec e of br ead.  And we 
went to do the wor k . When we c ame back  in the evening, they gave us s oup.  Now, it was  water .  You 

c ouldn't even find the potato peel in it.  So r ight away we bec am e weaker bec aus e we did not have that 
m uc h food.  And when we finis hed this  area, we had to go to another area.  So I was  in four different 
labor  c amps  doing the sam e work, and the s am e everything.

Death Mar c hes.  They didn't.  Now when you look  through doc um ents  they think maybe bec aus e.  But 
they told us again, take your blanket, take your dis h for  food, we ar e leaving the ghetto.  Not the ghetto, 

the labor c am p.

We started what is c alled the Death Mar c hes .  We m arc hed through the town, the villages  of 
Poland and Germ any.  Ther e is  really not a doc um ent of exac tly how m any m onths we did it.  At night 
s om etimes  they put us  in a barn, s ometim es in an anc ient s c hool som ewhere.
 
One night we wer e in a 
bar n and all of a s udden I hear d a m an s cr eaming.  The farm ers wer e s cream ing.  He was  s aying 
thos e 
dir ty wom en ar e in the bar n and now they ar e m ilking my c ows .  A c ow gives  milk the next day, too.  
Ins tead of s aying thank  God they have a little milk , the guar ds c has ed us  out, outs ide.  Two s ides  

s tanding with pic k s  or  whatever , I don't r em ember now anymore what I h
ad
, a
 
gun on the other  s ide.  I 
don't know.  And they wer e hitting us.  And they hit m e over the s ide, k nock ed out.  I fell on the floor.  

On the ground. Women were running over m e.  One wom an stops, "Little gir l, get up, get up, they'll kill 
you."  She pulled me up.  It was  ter rible.  Can you imagine a man yelling and not wor rying about killing 
all of thos e people or helping them? 
 
 
We k ept walking until the m iddle of Februar y
 
1945
 u
ntil we c ame to a plac e wher e they put us  
into a barn.  Again, I don't know how many of us  were left there.  Som ebody said that they s aw a few 

people that I m et after the war  s aid that we wer e s till about 200 or whatev er.  I don't know.
 
 
The guar ds, r eally they never gave us food.  People died of hunger, of dis eas es .  Ever y 
m or
ning the wom en that were a little healthier had to drag out the dead and they undress ed them 
naked.  So then it was  a pile alr eady.  So they m ade people mak e two holes , one on that s ide, one on 

the other s ide.  One s ide was  the bathr oom.  The other s ide wa
s  the gr ave.
 
 
My dear fr iends, what my eyes saw when I was  not quite 17 year s old.  A m ountain of 
s keletons .  I us ed to go into the bar n, sit ther e and c ry and s ay, "God, let m e die, let m e die."  And the 

women s aid to me, "Little gir l, don't pray to die. 
 
Pray to live.  But if you s ur vive, don't let us be 
forgotten.  Teac h the world what hatr ed, indifference, and pr ejudic e can do."  
 
 
And this  is why with the s ur vivors , we dedic ated our  life to r emember all over  the wor ld.  But 
we ar e ver y luc ky that we live in the United States  of Am eric a that we hav e this  m ost wonderful 
ins titution of educ ation that you c an now c ome and hear exac tly what happened to hum an beings .
 
I hope when you leave
 
this  plac e, you won't s ee rac e, you won't s ee a religion, you will s ee a human 
being.  Res pect what the Lor d, by whatever  name we c all him , cr eated.

Ric e:  The Soviet Army cam e and liber ated you.  What happened to you after  
liberation? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: What happened to me after liber ation?  I was  s o beaten up.  My fac e was  s wollen.  I 
have marks where they hit m e.  In the s c hool, in the village, they m ade lik e a hos pital.  I really don't 
r em em ber even when they c ar ried m e there.  I knew fr om the people later , like a whole week I was  
unc ons c ious .  I didn't know wher e I was  or whatever.
 
And then s om ebody s ays , "What's  your name, 
little girl?"  So I s aid, "Nes s e Godin."  Som ebody s
aid, "Oh, Nes s e, that's you."  We ar e here in the 
hos pital.  Please, pleas e, take c ar e of yours elf.  Look , the Soviets  helping
 
us .  They giving us  food.  
And eventually out of the hos pital

Here were poster s around the wor ld for  eac h country, for eac h town.  And one 
day I was  s tanding and signing my nam e.  And a woman was  s tanding there.  And s he s aid, "Little girl, I 

don't r emember anybody fr om Siauliai, Lithuania, like you."  
I said,

Ric e:  Exac tly.  
 
 
It's  an honor to tweet you.  Do you have any hatred for the Nazis  and the people that 
impr is oned you?  Thank  you.
 
 
So do you s till have animos ity towar ds  the Nazis  or to the Germ an people? 
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, 
I tell you
,  
I don't have anything against the Germ an people bec aus e the 
Germ an people in thos e days , they c los ed their  door  and as  long as  they weren't bother ed, they didn't 

do nothing.  So ther e is a ques tion
: 
Ar e they guilt or ar en't they guilty?  Why did they allow Hitler to be 
in power  all of thos e years ? Look, we are having elec tions  now.  Look  what's  going on.  And we pic k  

who we want.  But in thos e days  Hitler stayed in power .
 
 
Now, the Nazis  that killed m any of them, they wer e taken to jail.  But s ome wer e in hiding.  
Some were even helped by other  c ountries and lived their life until they died.  But I always  s ay we have 

to live a life, a nic e life, with r es pect to all hum an beings .  The Lord in heaven, by whatever name we 
c all him, I r epeat, I repeat, cr eated us all.  But I always  als o think  when we die and we go up, we c annot 
jus t s ay I'll go into heaven, I won't go to hell.  There will be a gate.  I don't know who is  going to s tand 
ther e, Muham mad, Mos es , I don't know but there will be a s c ale and you will have to put down what 

you did good things  or  bad things  while you were on earth.  Now, if thos e Nazis  that killed babies  and 
other hum an beings , you know
,  
the gate is  not going to open to heaven.  Down to hell they will go.  If 
you do s omething bad, will s till have to pay for it.  So you have to live a life of res pec t.  
 
 
And I really hope, I r epeat always  the s ame thing, when you leave our m us eum , look at the 
world ar ound you.  Don't s ee a r ac e.  Don't s ee r eligion.  See a hum an being that the Lord in heaven, 
by whatever name we c all him , cr eated.

I went to Lithuania.  In Lithuania, in Siauliai, where over  1,000 J ews  lived, ther e were 250.  
1980 I went.  And they had a little offic e.
  
And outs ide c hildren were s inging Hebrew s ongs , J ewis h 
s ongs.  And I s aid
, ﬁW
hat do you do for  the c hildr en for  Hanuk kah?  Do you give them a pr es ent?
ﬂ
  
Oh, 
no.  We have to c los e up bec aus e we don't have food, pay for food.  I said, well, I'm not r ic h bu
t let me 

s ee what I c an do for you.  So when I c ame back  hom e I c ame to s ome people in the m us eum who 
were in c harge.  They c ouldn't give m e their money but they s aid, Nes s e, people know you
; s
end out a 
letter
; t
ell them  exac tly what you need the money for
.  I
t  
s aid I need
 
$500.  So I s ent out the letter and 
r ais ed
 
$1,200.  In Siauliai, Lithuania, s om e other people went.  Ther e is a little pic ture of m e, the 
s pons or of Lithuanians  com m unity, J ewis h c ommunity.  So, you s ee, if we want to do s om ething good, 

w
e c an do.
 
 
But going to the point wher e you ask .  When I went back  to Stutthof
 
and I s tood ther e and I 
s aid: Dear God, you saw what happened her e.  I'm  not going to c los e m y eyes .  I'm going to k eep them  

open.  I'll believe in you.  And I'll teach the worl
d what happened.
 
 
Nobody c an have a c losur e after  what they lived thr ough, but we did.  So I'm glad you asked 
that ques tion.

Ric e:  It's our tr adition here at
 
Firs t Pers on
 
to let the s urvivor  have the last word.  
But before we do that I'm going to ask  for s om e audienc e par tic ipation.  This  is  wher e you get a photo 

opportunity with Nes s e.  Nes s e is  going to s ay s om e final words  to us .  And then I'm going to ask  that 
you all stand up.  And our  wonderful photographer, wherever  he happens  to be at the moment, J oel, is  
going to take a pic ture of Nes s e with all of you.  So one m inute to a photo
-
op.
 
 
Nes s e, do you have s ome las t wor ds  for us?
 
> > Ness e Godin: Well, I always  s aid it
 
little by little through the talk.  You see, we c an't forget about it.  
Some people s ay just forget about it.  How c an you forget about it?  How c an you forget the m illions  
that wer e killed?
 
 
So again, I mentioned it befor e, when you leave this  plac e, the
 
m ost wonderful institution of 
educ ation, the Holoc aus t 
M
us eum , look at the world ar ound you.  Don't wor ry about the r ace or religion.  
You s ee a hum an being that the Lor d in heaven created.  And let's be ther e for  eac h other, helping 
eac h other .
 
 
A  little
 
thing I want to s har e.  One day I c ame to my s on's  hous e and the two gir ls .  I s aw they 
had a dollar  and a little bottle of water.  I s aid, 
ﬁW
hat's that?
ﬂ
  
They s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, when we were with 
m ommy, ther e ar e people that are hungr y s o we give them  the dollar  but it was  s o hot in the s ummer, 
s o they need a little drink .
ﬂ 
So you s ee, thos e two little gir ls  who do that, eac h of us  c an do s om ething.  
So really, let's help the hungry, the people that are in need.  Be ther e for eac h other .  And we
'll mak e it 

a better world.
