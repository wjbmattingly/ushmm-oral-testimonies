Correction, this will be Sound Roll 1 syncing w
ith Camera Roll 1, Take 1, Norbert Wollheim's 
interview. 

 

Should I look at you or, or look at... 

 

You should look at me , and I will interrupt you when 
we run out.  When we run out, I will actually 
hear it.  I'm sitting close enough to the camera.  
And, I'll probably let you finish your sentence, but 
then I'll stop you. 

 

Beep. 

 

I'd like you to describe when and how your parent
s were deported, and the resistance that you and 

your wife felt at the time and your joint pledge to each other. 

 

Well, my parents were deported in December, 1942, and 
they were part of the first transport, also 
found out later to uh, Auschwitz.  Um, I've never see, 
I've never seen them again after that.  And we 
were aware, suddenly, of the fact 
that one day it will be us too that will be taken away from Berlin 
or wherever we used to live at this time.  My pa
rents, uh, had lived on the Eastern part of Berlin. 
My then wife and I were living in, in, uh We st, uh, the Western part of
 the ----------- with our child 

of 3 and a half years, and so, th
erefore, we knew that certain preparations had to be made before 
that day in a way to get uh, we had knapsacks prep
ared, and some  books, a chess set, toys for my 
child, and so, and, irrespectful of the fact that 
we didn't know where, uh, uh, uh we had to go, when 
we would be taken away, and um, 
so uh, we thought that uh, to be go, to go away would just be a, 
uh, a another, another part of this chapter, and that we had just to uh, um, uh, uh...find the 

endurance to uh, to uh, to uh, to uh survive, and then
 in order to survive the regime and, and, and 
wait for the ------liberations because when uh, my parents were deported and the turn came on us 

uh, the tides of, of the uh, of uh the uh, military even
ts had ch, had turned already.  It was of the 
Stalingrad? ?  and my hopes and my feelings were that this was more or less the end of the uh, uh 

superiority of the uh German forces, and the Ge
rman military power, and it was also certainly 

already after --------------, when the British had br
oken uh, the uh, power of Oman and North 
Africa, so the Germans were, were, were on the 
run.  So, uh, we had hope 
that uh, also America 
was also already in the war, and we uh, at leas
t I feeling that Germany couldn't match the power 

 
 
and the economical and military power of the uh, uh 
Allies, especially of the America.  America 
had  become  part of the, that uh, the Germans didn't have any chance to win that war.  And, so uh, 
we build up this kind of inner resistance and hope that uh. 

 

We have to stop because of the timing??? 

 

Beep.

So, actually eh, when we were deported from Ber
lin in uh, February, yeah, so they ma rch in 1943. 
It was uh, after the uh, the uh, um, defeat of Sta
lingrad had become obvious to the whole world. 
But also uh, interesting enough, uh it was the time 
when, for the first time uh, the uh, uh, allied air 
forces showed their superiority, and because I reme
mber uh, a week I think before we were actually 
deported, the uh, um, American Air Force ma de a ma
jor raid against Berlin, and the one of the 
hopes we had were that um, the railways leading to
 the East or wherever it was where we were 
going would be destroyed, but this hope was in vain. 

 

Can you describe the actual deportation when you and your wife and son were taken. 

 

We ll, we were, we were, you know, they appeared. 
 The uh, the Gestapo appeared in our--we were 
living uh, in, in our own apartments at this time.
  Germany never had a ghetto.  In Germany never 
had ghettos. So uh, we were living in our apt and 
uh I had gotten some advice that I shouldn't go to 
my, to work.  I was at this time part of the sl
ave labor program in Berlin, and uh, stayed at home 
with my wife, then wife and 
child, and uh, uh, then uh, uh, we some how heard that in, in the 
morning the uh, elite SS had uh occupied uh the pl
aces where Jews worked in, in working groups, 
had taken them away.  And uh, then they came a
nd appeared in the afternoon, asked us to get 
ready, and um, uh, we were not complete, full-fully
 surprised.  But, uh, I reme mber my, my son 
was just sleeping, and my ------, my wife, asked, 
uh, these people, who were by the way not in 
uniform, uh, to give them a few more mi nutes to 
get the child ready and so, and uh, they agree. 
And then when we, when we left our 
apt, they sealed it with
 a, with a, with a, 
with a eagle of the uh 
Nazi Reich, and they walked us down, and then
 when we came down, we saw a truck with SS 
guards with rifles, and for a mome nt uh, that wa
s um, um, uh not a, a ve
ry discouraging and, and, 
and, but um, still we didn't know what they wanted 
it, but they, but then um, um, ask us to, to 
ascend the truck, and we found other people on that truck uh, which was completely covered. 

People from out-inside couldn't see what's going 
on on the outside, and it turned out that these 

 
 
people who were driven around, who had been dr
iven around before, were people who uh, whose 
husbands had been taken from the, the different fact
ories in Berlin.  In other words, when they took 
this action which they called the final solution in
 Berlin, they took a ma n from the uh, from these 
places where they were, where they were working, and then they went af
ter the members of the 
family, and their different places, so that uh, uh, uh the families uh never saw each other again. 

They were deported in a different way.  I, luckil
y, was with my then with my then and, and, and 
child, and then we were taken around in Berlin, 
that was the time of the blackout.   You, you uh, 
even if we could have uh, looked out, you woul dn't uh, know what was goi
ng on.  And we were 
riding around for quite some  time, and then we landed some where, and, later found out it was, was 

some  kind of soldier barracks, uh, uh, where we were
 put overnight, and then uh, shifted to, to our 
collection point from uh -------------- in, in Berlin, and 
uh, then the procedure of deportation started 
with all kind of uh paperwork. Uh, 
certainly the, even in the mi ddle of that war when everything 
was short including paper, there was enough paper for all kind of procedures and, uh, we had to uh, 

uh declare our so-called uh funds, uh, our possessions
, and we were served with a uh, with a uh, 

with a uh, kind of uh, summons if you want to, sayi
ng that we had been uh, uh declared enemy of 
the Reich uh because of our behavior, and that 
we would be deprived 
of our property, and uh, 
these, this uh, this was served on all of us, in
cluding my then child of 
3 and a half years, uh, 
because of  also his outrageous behavior towards th
e German Reich.  Uh, after 2 or 3 days when we 
were taken, uh, kept there, we were, uh, taken 
by trucks to uh German uh, uh Freight railroad 
station, and uh, put on on cattle cars,
 and uh, then uh this train with approximately 1000 people left 
Berlin.  We  were uh, we were on, on each of 
a, uh, uh, uh, uh, of these boxcars, there were 
approximately 60 to 70 people, just a bucket for uh sa
nitary purposes.  Uh no water.  Hardly any air 
because these were uh, in, and uh, in, in the af
ternoon, if I'm not mi staken, it was March 12, 1943, 
we left  Berlin in the direction to the East.  U
h, I also vividly remember it was a Friday night, and 
uh, there was a lady, when uh, reme mbered it, and, 
obviously in preparation of the event, I don't 
know, had taken some  candles along, and, uh, uh lit th
e candle, uh, uh to celebrate the Sabbath, the 
Jewish, the Jewish uh, uh Sabbath.  And uh 
prayers were said, and uh it is--------------- when you 

look back on this, that uh, and you consider that
 was probably 95 of the people uh going with me  
on that night, um, did not live to see the next even
ing anymore, but still, on that Friday night, they 
were saying their prayers and, 
and, and, and, um, um, praying to God, and, and uh, uh, giving him 
credit uh, for I don't know what. 

 

We 'r e running out. 

 

(Sandy and Norbert talking off camera)

Uh, when we boarded the uh boxcars, uh, we f
ound ourselves, and we we
re very, not too happy 
about it, found ourselves in the presence of ot
her young people who uh, with whom we had grown 

up in the Jewish Youth Moveme nt.  So, we were
 not completely alone, uh, many of the people, 
other people just were isolated uh because, their 
husbands, uh, or, or, other members of the families 
have been taken custody, into custody before, and 
uh, some how uh, for reasons are, are difficult to 
explain, we had a certain amount of relief because 
after all these weeks of
 waiting and these weeks 
of expectations, knowing that so many trains in tr ansport have left Berlin already before.  We 

thought now it's, now it's a, it's a new chapter, and we were looking, we were actually um, looking 

forward to that chapter with optimism and uh hopi
ng or believing or envisioning that we would be 
taken to some  kind of a labor camp and so where 
we would uh work, but survive, and wait for the 
end of the war.  And, uh, uh, I was as, with my, w
ith my child and my wife, and uh, our child slept 
a lot, and, and uh, uh when, was difficult to find out
 where we were going, but when we saw that 
we are going toward the east, we, my wife and I 
talked about uh, the time when we had made this 
trip in this direction voluntarily on our honeymoon 
a couple of years earlier, in the direction to 
Silesia, and also uh, uh, she and others wrote 
uh cards, postcards because uh, we knew it from, 
from, from things what, from uh, transports whic
h had left Berlin before, that the people have 
thrown out these cards, and these cards  had b
een picked up on the outside and had been ma iled, 

interesting enough.  So, uh, uh, to repeat, we, we 
were in such rather good mood that we even 

started to sing.  There was a song 
in the youth movement that's uh, it's in Hebrew, how nice it is 
when friends sit together, and, and are together in, 
in friendship.  So, uh, therefore, I say, in general, 
it was uh, uh a mood of expectation and, and since 
it was Friday evening, uh, after darkness fell in, 
uh, one of the elderly ladies uh, uh remembered 
that, she had taken some candles along, and she 
was lighting the candles and saying the prayer
s and uh, we found this some how encouraging uh 

though it's so uh absolutely irrational, almost
 irrational, that here uh, well nobody but nobody knew 
about it that 95% of the people uh on that train w
ould not live to see the next evening.  Uh, but 
nevertheless, uh, uh, people prayed, praising G
od, uh, um, for what?   So, uh, the train took 
approximately 24 hours from Berlin to the East. 
 We still didn't know exactly where it was going. 
We saw at one point in the morning the name 
of Katavitz, which uh, we knew was upper Silesia, 

and then, uh, uh, not far from Katavitz, the uh, uh, 
train came to a halt, and, and, the sign somehow 
said uh, "-------------------."  When the train came to a 
full stop, the doors, which had been sealed 
when we left Berlin were ope
ned, and we found uh, outside, SS guards with rifles to the same  
extent that we had seen them in Berlin, but, an 
almost completely different type uh acting, almost 

 
 
like animals, yelling and shouting and, and, and h
itting with sticks, and everybody had to jump out 
from these boxcars which was not easy after 24 hours
--it was rather cold winter night, it was only 
in March, and um, then came the order, um, leave all the luggage where it is, forget about the 
luggage, and, but what was far more important a
nd, and, and more gruesome that the order came 
um, me n to the, to, in one group, wome n with
 children to another group, and women without 
children a third group.  And this is, that was th
e mome nt when, when um, I said, had to say 
goodbye to my then wife, and, and ch
ild, and my wife who had always been very courageous, very 
optimistic, uh, looking forward uh to a better future
, said, "This is actually the moment I have 
feared most, that they would se
parate us."  And um, then when we, when we were had uh, uh -------
-----, we had to form these groups, we had to pass by 
uh some SS officers.  I, I was, later I learned 
one of them was the infamous Dr. Mengele, uh, 
though it was already a couple of years into the 
war, they looked very well-fed, almost elegant in their uniforms, and uh, this SS officer asked 

certain questions, about your age, about your occupa
tion, about your state of health, and then with 
his hand, with his thumb, I would sa
y, move to left or to the right, which means, uh, to the right 
was life, to the left  was death.  Uh, children, 
and the wome n with children, then, uh we noticed 
were loaded on special other trucks, none of us had any idea what, what's going to happen with 

them.  I saw the SS trucks leaving, my wife, uh, 
some how I had uh, uh found a place at the end of 
the truck, so we waved to each other, and that's th
e last I have ever seen of her.  Uh, the women 
without children were also then uh, uh loaded 
on trucks by a group of wome n in SS uniform, for 

the first time I had seen these women in a unifo
rm with their uh revolvers hanging out and also 
acting with their sticks and, and, and, and acti
ng like animals.  Uh, not very charmi ng...and, and 

wome n-like.  And, but then we were, we were 
uh, uh, from that station, which was Osvientian, we, 
the uh, we were taken along a tremendous uh area 
of factories, factory buildings, and, uh, -----------
--- place we didn't know, and then we noticed that 
the trucks turned into a campsite surrounded by 
barbed wire.  And, uh, watchtowers.  There wa
s SS guards on the watchtowers with ma chine guns, 
and then I realized that uh, uh, we had reached a 
point, uh, where really a question of survival was 
of utter importance, and I said to my friends w
ith whom I luckily had found, we were always trying 
to keep together, ma y God help us to keep us, to ge
t out of here alive.  And this is when we, when 
we landed in, in that camp, which uh, uh, and still 
we didn't know where we
 were, and, we were 

received by, by uh, uh, some, some people in peculiar 
kind of uniforms.  I uh, never seen these kind 
of uniforms, uh, before, although I later realized that
 was the same  kind of uniform we had to wear 
later.  We were asked, we were ordered to give
 away all valuables.  There were hardly any 

valuables we had on us, like, besides watches and ri
ngs and so, orders was, we take, was taken in 
by the SS uh, uh, have the people there, and uh, th
en uh, uh, uh, we were directed to a, to 
some place uh, uh, after being undressed, where we, we th
ey gave us a shower, and they treated us 
with a terrible kind of an ointment, probably for 
disinfection purposes, and uh, they cut completely 

 
 
our hair, uh, which means that we 
lost our kind of personality in this respect.  We still didn't know 
where we were.  And, standing there and waiting 
and some of these people got almost alarmed 
because there were rumors in Berlin about uh ga
ssing and so forth, but we
 really didn't know any 
facts.  And uh, then one ma n who came up , he 
always, all, uh, he was obviously an old-timer, 
which he wa-which he was, and uh, he had been
 uh political opponent of Hitler, Jewish fellow who 
had fought in Spain against the Franco regime, had 
been caught there, and then been transferred to 
the, to the Nazis, and we ask him, "Where are 
you, and what's going on here? "   And then he said, 
"Well, be aware, you have just come in to the 
concentration, concentration camp of Auschwitz. 
Uh, don't ask about your uh, wives and your children if
 you have come  with them.  They have to 
take care of themselves.  We are here already for 
years and years.  Praise yourself for lucky that it 
took you that long.  Uh, we are building here a, th
is is a place which is called Buna, which is a 
bran-- 
 

We have to reload. 

 

beep. 

 

When you finish describing registration, can you ta
lk a little bit about how everything happened so 
fast and you couldn't believe--take in what it was.  
But then go on to your decision to resist in the 
different ways that you did resist. 

 

Yes, but, uh, uh, for me  uh wanted 
to bring to--in, what, I think which is of importance, that 
information then, at this mome nt, uh when, when 
we still were not fully aware, where we were, 
what, what uh this ma n, who give us the in
formation, ---------------- if you were in Auschwitz, but 
also give the information that we have been brought there in order to  be uh slave laborers in uh a 

big um uh, ---------------- factory, built by-------------- of Germany, which is the equivalent to 

DuPont in, in, in America, where this factory is
 being constructed in order to produce artificial 
rubber of which Germany was short, and uh, that this
 must be our task, and um, if we could do the 
work and we would have the chance to survive, 
and it would not uh, uh, we, 
the um that would be 
the end of our road.  Um, so, suddenly having come  
from, from the outside, having just been there, 
though the shock, the culture shock was tremendous
 because after having uh, uh seen our hair 
shaven and so and having uh received our new 
uniform, uh, it was not uh, it was, I mean, your 
mi nd was almost completely blotted out to, to accept th
at, and to, to realize and then to adapt to it. 
Uh, but, uh, it was hardly time for th
at.  When we were, then after these procedures, released into 
the, into the, the barracks, and found the people who 
had come to this place just a week earlier or a 
few days earlier from Berlin and so, they told us, 
uh, or shared their experiences with us, said that 

 
 
the, the work was ha-harsh, that was, that the c
onditions were, were, were very, very difficult, that 
certainly your food was scarce, but 
that uh, uh, since most of us, of us, had worked in so-called 
forced labor in Berlin before, we were some how 
trained for, for heavy work.  Um, and um, then 
also, what was important too, too, what added to th
is culture shock was that uh, we lost our names, 
we lost our identity, uh, we got a number, and this number was tattooed on our arms.  Uh, mi ne was 
107984.  And, uh, uh, uh, therefore, y-y-you had become  
a number.  And the questions which came 
up certainly, would you turn into a number?   And, uh, especially at the beginning, we still, we 

pledged to ourselves we will endure it, we'll, we'll tr
y our best to fight for our lives and for survival, 
if possible, because uh, uh, we wanted to outlive Hitler.  And then uh, we had a first day of 

experience when we were uh ma rched to the, to 
the tremendous area of, of factories of Codbuna? ?  
Uh, it was a vast area of mud in these days
, uh, it was March, uh rain had uh had come  down 
mercilessly, and, and, and it was, it was, there were 
no real roads, and so to, to walk was very 
difficult, took a lot of strength to do it.  And then
 uh, we were put uh, especi
ally in, for newcomers, 
this was the destiny, you were destined to do the 
most difficult work, which was transport and, and 
digging, and uh, this was not just done in a, in a leisurely way, but uh, mostly running around with 

cement and iron and things like that, and, and, and 
uh there are certain techniques how to handle, 
for instance, a transport of iron 
in order to protect yourself, and , but with, with cement it was 
terribly difficult because especially when you, wh
en the rain came down, and these bags, these 
cement bags opened, then, uh, cement uh, turned 
into cake and then covered your, your, your uh, 

clothing, and your body, and uh, uh, the ot
her side of our so-called existence or life there was that 
there was hardly any, any chance to keep clean 
because we were not allowed to possess anything, 
and, no, no, no, there was certainly no money, no 
uh, no uh, we had no toothbrushes, we had uh, 
uh, no knives, we had, the, the, the only thing they gave
 us was just a, a bowl, uh, to be used for, for 

the, for the soup uh, uh, to which they treated us
, but nothing else.  And, uh, so uh it was, it was, 
difficult, almost impossible to keep uh yourself clean, especially under these working conditions, 

and we were fully aware that, that uh, uh, without
 uh being able to keep clean, all kind of uh, uh 

disasters could strike, diseases and so on. Uh, one of
 the things, for instance, we learned very fast 
was that when the cement bags, which had 3 differe
nt layers of paper, 
uh opened you could use the 
mi ddle layer to uh, for as, as, as a kind of toile
t paper, or to uh, to uh protect your wounds and 
things like that.  So, in other words, you come b
ack to a very, very primitive kind of existence to 
which not everybody was used.  And uh, after, I w
ould say, a couple of da
ys, we had the first 
victims, people had enough.  Uh, uh in the morn
ing, for instance, when we www-walked this 

stretch from the camp, which was outside of the f
actory, to the factory which was approximately a 
mile or more.  Many of those, of the people said uh, uh, they had enough, and they ran out of the, of 

our group, and the SS guards uh accompanying us, th
en were shooting these people to death, uh, 

which they liked to do because, I understand, they 
were, got a certain compensation for that--so and 

 
 
so ma ny days uh, of vacation, and the next a bonus or
 some thing like that.  So, uh, in this way we 
lost people because of exhaustion 
and, and, and ,and uh people lost their, their will to survive there, 
their, their, their ----------, 
will to survive, and their lon de vivre?? as the French say.  Um, a 
question certainly came to all of us, how long will 
we be able to hold out.  And um, uh, uh, I was, 
uh, when I was pondering that question, uh, I was luc
ky then to be shifted to some  other command 
uh, uh, uh, different work styles, and so it still was the,
 the conditions were terrible, the, the, the, 
the, the, was hardly any protection uh against the ra
in especially, and against the cold weather.  Uh, 
our clothing was very thin.  We  were freezing, a
nd, and especially in the morning temperatures, 
and that's a reason why, why, very 
often when we came back from the camp, we had to carry the 
bodies of our people who had perished on the spot 
in, in the factory, and uh, I think of the 4 weeks 
of existence there, we had lost, we were appr
oxima tely 220 me n, if I'm not mi staken, out of a 
thousand, who had been uh, selected for work, 
uh or 240 if I'm not mi staken, almost 100 had 
already uh, uh, uh, uh perished, and so the uh, th-this group became thinner and thinner.    

 

Tell me  about  your friend, Fritz Schaeffer, w
ho sort of resisted by deciding to die.  
 

We ll, he was one of those victims.  Uh, uh, they 
called it an a, an a, a terrible expression, which 
was meant in the camp for reasons I did not quite
, have never quite, the etymology of it has never 
been, become clear to me, were called musselmen. 
 In other words, if people were so exhausted, 
and, because, you know, the food was, was so poor 
that you couldn't uh work up any energy or, or 
replenish the energy.  And, he was one of those, 
my friend, Fritz Schaeffe
r, who, uh, had suffered a 
l o t .   He  wa s a  wonde r ful  man, uh, he  wa s, 
he  wa s a  good 
mmmma n, he  
l ove d musi c, he ha d a 
beautiful tenor voice, and he has, had acted uh, 
uh as a hobby, as a cantor, in, in his community. 

And, one evening, he came to me , and, and he looke
d terrible, and uh, he said, "I have enough.  I 

am giving up."  And I tried to convince him that uh, th
at this can't be since he was a man of uh trad-
a traditional Jew.  I said, "You have
 no right to do that.  You know the teachings of the bible."  Uh, 
he said, "Well, but uh, what we s
ee here, what we suffer here, for this, there, there's no provision in 
the bible, and I simply cannot go on."  And uh, he
 was sick.  Also, he had uh, probably an uh, uh, 
uh, it was called by Pneu, pneu-pneumoni
a.  Uh, and, in the evening of uh, uh, he had to try to be 

admitted to the so-called hospital, which was fe
ared by all inmates because to go in uh to the 
hospital always entailed the danger to be selected 
and to be sent away fo
r death.  So he had gone 
there, and the people had refused to admit him, so in the morning after dawn, he ran against the 

barbed wire, and it was a rule there that if 
any, anybody ru-was running against the barbed wire, 
which was electrified, by the way, th
at the guards will, would, would shoot this per, this person to 
death, and I didn't know that it was him.  We hear
d the shooting all, all, all night, sometimes the 
guards... 

 
 
 
We have to reload. 

 

So how is it going, all right?  

 

Beep. 

 

Why don't you just pick that up.  I thought you said before that he didn't want to be kicked to death.  

 

That's right.  He said, when we had ----------, uh, when
 we had our little talk, and I tried to convince 
him that uh, he should go on, and try 
to go on, last of least because of his religious conviction, and, 
and he said that uh, the bible doesn't  provide fo
r this situation, and, and, and also, he has enough 
because he doesn't  want to be kicked to deat
h.  And, um, then, uh, the next mor--during the night, 
we, we heard shooting.  Now, shooting was nothing 
unusual.  Very often the guards, in order to 

keep themselves awake, were shooting.  And, uh, we
 heard it in the morning, and I heard it in the 
morning.  We  didn't know anything, uh, but then 
uh, when we were walking uh, uh to work, uh, a 
fellow um, a friend of mi ne who had been on th
e, on the same  block with my friend, Fritz 
Schaeffer, said, "You know, did you hear the uh s
hooting this morning? "  I said, "Yes, what 
happened? ? "   He said, "Your friend, Fritz Shaeffer, 
he ran against the barbed wire in order to be 
shot, and  because he, he, he said, he  had e
nough."  So, when I heard th
is, and reflecting on the 
discussion we had the night before, the t
hought came to my mi nd, my goodness how long will you 
be able to hold out, and isn't it what he did, 
actually uh, more rational.  Though it mi ght be uh 
irrational reasons.  Uh, so I was pondering that 
question, and uh, certainly it was, uh death was 
cheap in Auschwitz, so it could be attained immedi
ately if you wanted to.  
But then, uh, as, as, as 
very often happened in, in my situation and othe
r situations, always something special came up. 
Uh, on that evening when I came back, and was an awful day again, uh, they called the people back 

to the central labor office in, in the camp.  Whe
n, uh I entered, uh, Auschwitz and I was asked what 
my occupation was, I didn't tell them that I had been a student of law, and I didn't tell them that I 

had worked as a social worker.  I told them that I have been a welder, a welder, because, as a matter 

of fact, I had uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh taken up welding in
 connection with my own preparations to 
find a way out of Germany.   And I was advised it w
ould be a good idea to have some  kind of trade, 
and welding would be helpful.  Uh, so I trai
ned in --------welding, the Jewish community in Berl-
Berlin had  these uh vocational training uh, uh classe
s, and, so I said I'm a welder.  Uh, the fellow 
registered me uh completely believed it because
 of my glasses and so, and, and, and, but, you 
know, there uh, uh, uh, uh, it didn't ma tter.  And obvi
ously uh, uh, uh, they were interested, they, 
uh became short of manpower already because it was 
after Stalingrad, and uh, so they called us to 

 
 
that labor office, and again the question was as
ked, uh, what is your prof
ession?   And, we were 
told, uh, working in that factory, that they'r e in n
eed of certain special qualifications, certain special 
skills.  So, I registered again as a welder, and that 
raised my hopes that if I had a chance to work as 
a welder, I mi ght have a chance to survive.  Uh, so that gave me  a new lease on life, if you want to. 
 

Tell me  about the Polish welder who sabotaged the German work. 

 

We ll, I was changing from one uh comma nd to another. 
 I got a la- I luckily got out of that terrible 
murder command of transportation and, and digging because of uh, the registration as a welder, and 

I was attached to a, to a ma n, who uh, in 
our comma nd, in our group, who uh, who um, uh was 
working with Polish civilians.  U
h, the man, I was, I was, uh, I became the assistant of a man, name 

was Smuda, and he was a, a, a some  kind what 
I called Foksdeutsch, which means, belo-belonging 
to that group which was not, their loyalties were, 
were was, was a little bit doubtful, but, here was 
a, fundame ntally a, a, a ma n, a Pole with a ve
ry strong national feelings
 for Poland.  ----------.  And 
he was an excellent welder.  So uh, we worked
 together.  And, uh, afte
r a certain while, uh, he 
helped me, he brought in once in a while a piece of
 sausage or a piece of bread, which was , which 
was very, very helpful, and one day I ask him, wh
en we had established a certain relationship, and 

you don't have to forget that everything was strictly
 controlled there.  Uh, I must uh make this uh 
remark here that at the beginning when we 
came to uh to uh Auschwitz, our working comma nds 
were accompanied by guards, approximately 10 or 
20 people and one guard and these guards were 
not the most pleasant people under the sky.  In c
onnection with Stalingrad, and the aftermath of 
Stalingrad, uh, more of these SS me n were sent to th
e front, to the, to the, 
to the in order to the 
Russian front, and, the Germans and the SS build 
a guard, a chain around the factory so that we 
were not watched completely by the SS guards in our
, our detailed work.  So therefore it was easier 
to come  back to uh, to work, was smoother to co
mmunicate with him, and uh, one day I, I, I ask 
him, uh, if he would be willing to send a letter 
for me to the neighbor uh, where I had lived in 
Berlin.  She was a wonderful human being, uh, 
uh, uh opposed to Nazism, uh working in a labor 
dept in Berlin, always being very helpful whe-
when we had not the right, for instance, to buy 
vegetables or, or fruits and so on, and under the 
protection of the blackout, very often, there was a 
knock at the door, and all of the sudden we found a, a,
 a little bag with, with some of these of these 
so called goodies.  So, uh, and I, when I, before we 
left, we also had left her with some pa-part of 
our belongings, and some money, so I wrote to 
her uh through Smuda, and Smuda mailed that letter 
to her, and she had the courage, and, though she c
ould not realize what it was, she was not, she was 
not aware of Auschwitz or so, but, she reacte
d, and sent Smuda uh bread and money, which was 
very important for me.  I couldn't use the money b
ecause it was, we were not allowed when we had 
no use for money, but the bread was, was, was ma
nna.  And, uh, so that was Smuda did.  The other 

 
 
thing what Smuda, as I said, sin
ce he was such an excellent welder, he had developed a technique 
since he didn't want to, to uh help the Germans to 
win the war, to uh, develop a certain technique of 
um, um, um sabotage.  Uh, there is a certain
 way, when you weld, and we had this spe-our 
specialty in welding was pipe welding, that was 
just the pipes under, under high pressure, for pipes 
under high pressure, that by adjusting your, the 
burn off, the, off the welding tool, uh, you, you, 
you, you um uh, uh put certain defects into the, in
to this uh, uh connecting uh welding uh piece, 
and that's what he did, and I must say, I loved to s
ee that, and I loved to learn it, and I did it.  Uh, 
because I also was not interested to uh to uh to uh to
 have that on my conscience later to say that I 
helped the Germans to win the war.  So, uh, uh, 
uh that's what we did.  So, uh, uh, that was my 
experience with Smuda, which was a very pleasant 
one.  Uh, later I was shifted to another uh, uh 
comma ndo.  I lost sight of him, I don't know what ha
ppened to him.  I don't know uh if he was able 
to survive the war or not, uh, but uh he was a decent 
fellow, and I, I, I, I must, I'd like to, to pay 
recognition to that. 

 

What is a Kapo?   Just describe for me  as though I don't know, what is a Kapo?  

 

The etymology that led us to the origin of that
 never became quite clear to me.  It comes, I 
understand, from the imperative, and the Kapo was th
e ma n who was in charge.  He was the, he 
was an inma te himself, and es-especial wh
en you have a bigger comma nd, like I say, of 50, 60 

people, there were the, there was a supervisor what
 they called in German, the forarbeiter,  and the 
fellow who was in comma nd of this labor detatchm
ent, and they called him Kapo.  Uh, there were 
mor-they were mainly or mostly uh, an elderly hef, not an elderly, a, a haftling, who had spent uh 

quite some time in, in, in the camps already, and he
 had certain privileges as far as food and so is 
concerned, but, and there were uh, a Kapo is a se
nsitive issue because uh, certain people uh, we had 
diffi culties especially when we came to, to Auschw
itz, where these functions were mainly an ends 
of Poles, some  of them were rather rabid an
tisemites, antisemites, and um, very, many of them 
abused the power they had, uh, 

 

We have to reload. 

 

(Long tone) 

 

Under the uh, headline uh, uh, uh spiritual resistance. 

 

Yeah, and I don't know if it ma kes sense to you but... 

 

 
 
Beep. 
 

One of the reactions, certainly, of people as soon 
as you had uh spent at least 4 weeks or 6 weeks 
and you were still alive, was the question, how can you build up your, your, only physical 

resistance, but spiritual resistance, because we ar
e fully aware of the fact that um, we would be 
prisoners as long as Germany uh, uh, uh, the Nazi Regime  was in power, and uh, uh, obviously, uh, 

the military operations were not fast enough uh for us uh in order to be liberated.  Uh, one uh, uh 

specific thing was that people es
pecially, who were traditional Jews, uh, uh, uh, uh tried to build up 
their uh, uh spiritual resistance in this wa
y even uh, uh under the danger of being uh, uh, uh 

detected and uh being uh, uh punished for that, kept 
up for instance, trad-certain traditions.  In my 
block, uh, there was a ma n, uh, who had been taken fr
om Vienna with a so-called Polish accent. 
He was a, was a scholar.  Uh, and um, um a ma
n who had spent a couple of years before in 

Buchenwald, then had been transferred to uh, to 
uh Auschwitz, and, he organized uh, uh services in 

such a way that first of all, you ha
d to be very, very careful not to be detected what, what you was, 
did was, that he assembled uh in a traditional wa
y uh Jews are praying in 
the morning but in the 
evening, and especially in the morning, just 
assembled ten me n which we called a mi nion, uh, uh, 
assembled them for morning prayers.  Certainl
y there were no books because we didn't have any 

papers or any books, and so, so, all these prayer
s were, were, were spoken by heart, and I knew 
them very well, but just to participate in these,
 in these kinds of assemblies was very helpful, it 
was, it was nourishing us, it was, it gave us some ki
nd of lift up to the same  
extent as for instance 
even on the day of uh, of Yom Kippur which was 
the holiest day, in spite of everything, we 
assembled in, in the block of a friend, and their 
prayers were said, and whether the people were 
orthodox or reformed or conservative, it, it gave them something, I mean it was, was so 

contradictory that here where we though we were 
forlorn, and God had forsak
en us, that we were 
praying to that same  God, and wrestling with 
our, with our uh, uh conscience, uh, uh, uh wrestling 
with the question, "Where is God? "  Uh, we ha
d uh, uh in our group also 
a man, an elderly man, 
whom I had befriended; he had come  from Poland 
in his younger years after service in the Austrian 
army, had ma de his way to Berlin, he was a shoema
ker, and uh, he had built a nice family in Berlin, 

children, and he was stretching out his life, his, his 
existence, but then he was taken in September, 
1939 with a so-called Polish accent, and had been
 in a couple of the concentration camps--
Sachsenhausen then Dachau and Buchenwald, and wh
en I met him, he, I met him in Auschwitz.  A 
wonderful elderly man, simple, very pious, in spite
 of what everything had been done to him, he 
used to believe in his God.  And one day, uh, it wa
s a terrible day, the, the rain was beating down, 
we were standing on the, on the --------road called, on 
the big square, and they were counting us. 
And the, these SS uh gangsters were not very 
good in counting, uh, you know, the order had to be 
there, and if something was wrong it had to be uh, they had to count and recount time and again 

 
 
and again and again, and we were standing there,
 and uh, a wind was blowing me rcilessly from the 
Beskit? ?  Mountains, and we were standing there 
in our, in our uh, uh th
in clothing, uh clothing, 
and, and, and people collapsed, and uh, but, these ar
e the days and the mome nts when, when, when 

mi nutes become  hours and hours uh became, become  we
eks.  And all of a sudden I saw that friend 
of mi ne who was standing there not far from me  
praying, and I was looking at
 him, and I ask him, 
"Yakov, what are you doing, I mean you have said 
probably your morning prayers, and it's too 
early for the evening prayers, uh what are you doing?
"   He said, "No, I, that's right, I, I say a 
special prayer to God."  I said, "What are you doi
ng? "  He said, "I am, uh, prai-praising God."  I 
said, "Are you out of your mi nd?   
Praising God here in this situation where we are insulated, where 
we are isolated, left alone, uh, uh, uh, in, in, in this
, in this, uh hell, and you are praying to God, and 
you are thanking him? "  He said, "Yes, I am thanki
ng him."  Said, and I was very irritated, and I 
said, " What are you thinking?   What are you God 
thanking for? "  He said, "I'm thanking God for 
the fact that he didn't make me like the murderers around us." 

 

And now, can we talk about the old-timers who tried to escape. 

 

Yeah, that was in 4, 1944,uh, we knew already becau
se we had, we had uh, especially I had uh 
built up a contact with a prisoner, with a Br
itish prisoner of war who had been brought to 

Auschwitz against the rules and regulations of the Geneva Convention.  The uh British soldiers and 

I, I was able to befr iend them, and luckily I wa
s able to communicate in English with them, my 
school English was good enough, and they had uh, uh, uh radio set even in their camp, which was 

not far from our camp, by the wa
y, which was not under the SS, but under the German army.  And, 

when I became close uh with them, they uh brought me every morning news they had heard  the 

night before on BBC.  So we more or less 
knew uh what was going on, uh, uh, how the Ger, how 
the, uh especially that the Allied had landed at Normandy and, when the Russians came, became, 

got closer and closer with, with their armi es, 
and uh, so it's certainly we go excited because we 

knew that this is the mome nt we were waiting for 
because this means either life or death.  And uh, 
in that uh, uh, uh fall of 1944, 3 of 
our, of our, uh old timers, uh, who had spent years and years in 
camp, they had decided that uh, they tried to escape 
because  they were not, they were not sure if 
uh, the uh, if we would live to see the day of lib
eration, if the SS would not dynamite all these 
camps and put us to death like, like the others, w
ho have gone before us.  
So, they had a certain 
plan to escape, and they, unfortunately, were 
caught.  And uh, the penalty for this uh in the 
concentration camps was death.  And, uh, the German
s had a very, the gruesome , they ma de out of 
this a gruesome spectacle of public hanging, and one
 evening when we came back from work, we 
saw the gallows set up there for all 3 of them. 
 Uh, we knew already that this was some how 

pending because we knew that they had been di
scovered, and  that uh, the uh the uh, obviously the 

 
 
uh, uh, uh correspondence between  Berlin and Auschw
itz went back and forth, what to do with 
them, but certainly the, the sentence was death. 
 So, when we came in 
and uh, we, we, we heard 
that there was, that they would be destined to 
die. And, uh, it was a, a terri
ble day, it was uh, in fall, 
it was, it was uh, uh, uh, uh all the 10000 of us who were
 in that camp were ordered to come out 
and to watch that gruesome  spectacle.  And, uh, 
then the Germans uh kept a certain formality, 
reading uh the sentence, a death sentence, uh not in th
e name  of any court, but just in the name of 
Himml er, the, the head of the SS. And, uh, uh, just 
before the henchman did hi-is work, uh, one of 
them, doesn't  matter who it did, cried out in a voi
ce that, and we were as I say standing there uh 
with clenched uh fists and our uh, uh and, and uh ta
lking about where's God uh at this moment, and 
--------------, by the way, has written about it because he wa
s also there.  And said, just in that 
mome nt of when the, when the, when the senten
ce was read, and before the henchman could do his 
work, one of them cried out in a voice which c
ould be heard over the whole square by all the 10000 
assembled there, and they did it in German so 
that the henchman should understand, that the said, 
"-----------------," which means in English "You comr
ades, keep your heads, your heads high 
because we will be the last."  And then in a few mi nutes later they were no more. 

 

We'r e getting room tone Brett.  Stay still. 

 

End room tone. 

 

Beep. 

 

Um (clears throat) I would say some kind of a wate
rshed for the history of Jews in Germany, were 
the events of November 9, 1938.  Uh, this uh, ca
lled sometimes Kristallnacht, I don't use this 
expression because it's a label which came out fr
om Gobbel's uh propaganda mi nistry.   The day 
there after when they some how felt ashame d a
bout uh all these heaps of broken glass which 

covered the streets of Berlin.  Uh, in connection with these events, 
with the burning of the 
synagogues, the looting of the stores, the smashi
ng of the windows, uh also me n were taken uh, en 

masse uh, to uh German concentration camps, then 
within Germany.   Buchenwald and Dachau and 
Sachsenhausen Rhinebrook??? near Berlin.  And af
ter a couple of days, uh, uh, some of them were 
released, especially those who had been veterans 
of WWI , and but then they came  out.  They, they 
looked terrible because uh they'r e clothing had been a
ll the disinfectant, had been treated in a way 

they, they were, they appeared in the streets, 
looked like appearing in rocks.  And, in connection 
there with the Jewish community in Berlin, 
uh, which also was badly dama ged because uh, uh, uh 
some  of them, ma ny of the people had been taken away, and uh, for days uh the uh admi nistrative 

buildings had been closed.  They opened their 
rescue operation for those people who had re- had 

 
 
come out, especially in Berlin, for, from the 
concentration camp of ------.
  And, uh, people, uh, who 
uh, came uh out and were directed to the Jewish 
community where they got their first good meal, 
where they could uh, uh wash up again, and that wa
s one of my functions, I volunteered for that, 
because members of the Jewish Youth Movements volunteered for all these things.  Uh, I tried to 
connect the people by telephone with their families 
in different parts of Germany where they had 
been traken from, in the mi ddle of the night or 
so uh, in connection with the events of November 
9th.  And when we were working 
there, uh, uh one of my friends was the uh, the head of that relief 
uh, support, and it was my youth leader for ma ny, ma
ny years, he said, "Listen, I just got a call 
from uh, name is --------.  They just returned h
ead of the executive head
 of the uh, uh, uh central 
representation of Jewish in Germany.  Uh, there's a job to be done.  I understand that the British are 

willing to take uh children and uh, uh to E
ngland, and uh, uh, you are supposed to, to do 
some thing, see uh, uh this uh Dr. Hirsch.  Next morni
ng I found myself in his office.  As I indicated 
he had just returned also from the concentrati
on camp, but had returned immediately to work again 
as the executive director of the organization.  A
nd he told me  that the House of Commons in 
England, the debate of the situation of Jews in
 Germany and Austria, had been, uh, there was a 
debate in the House of Commons, and as a result there of, they have decided uh to give shelter to 

approximately 10,000 unaccompanied children from th
e age of 13 to 17 for the time being so the 
children could relax and could, could recover, and we
re not exposed to the persecution in, in, in, in 
Nazi Germany and Austria.  And, uh, that uh, opera
tions have to be set up, and uh, he wanted to 
help me because there was the uh, the uh, the uh, the uh, organization had wonderful social 

workers, but these uh, uh, uh, uh, especially ladies, 
had hardly any experience in technical work, 
and how to run the operations and so, I was not trained in that but uh I ha
d a certain, a certain, uh, 
uh, uh, capability for organizational things, which I 
also picked up during my existence in the 
youth moveme nt, and I uh, uh accepted the offer to se
rve there.  He promised me I was in the 
mi ddle also of my own preparati
ons with my then wife uh, uh to, to leave Germany uh, if possible. 
And, and so I got a commitment from the  gentleman Hirsch? ?  that as soon as the work would be 

done, he will see, the organization would see to it,
 that I would find also my, my way, into, to 
safety uh outside of Germany.  So I took over th
e uh technical, the responsibility for all technical 
arrangements to be made in order to bring th
e children out of Germany.  The project was 10000 
children.  That's it.  Now, that was not easy beca
use we have no experience in this field.  The 
children were selected by, by the welfare organizati
ons in the different cities of Germany, and then 
uh, don't like to go into the procedures--uh, in a simp
le way they got their permits, what they hand 

out at the English consulates in, 
in Germany, uh, but we had to see to it that they were transported 
out of Germany, so, uh, and that was not an
 easy job because there was no, no, no, no, uh, uh, uh, 
uh fax uh, there were no fax machines, and there, 
there was uh uh no dialing system for telephones, 

and so, so this uh and uh, uh, uh 
----------------, under which supervision all this certainly had to be 

 
 
done, was very meticulous, they wanted the exact reco
rds, uh to be checked, so all this preparatory 
work required a lot of preparations and labor.  
We  even were allowed to uh, uh send escorts from 
uh Germany with the children to England, and these had to be selected, and this was not easy 
because the Istapor??? gave permission for these 
escorts only under the provision that they would 
return to Germany from England in order to conti
nue the work.  Uh, uh, so what I had to do was to 
uh to uh to not only prepare the records, but also
 to see to it that on a 
certain day on a certain 
morning, all these children were, were collected 
in Berlin, for instance, where we had special 
railway wagons, which would take them on the way of via Berlin, Hanover, 
to Hopfen, Holland or 
Flushing, and to Herigen, England, where the committ
ee in England (clears throat) excuse me, was 
waiting for them to be then distributed (clears thro
at) at Liverport Street Station in London to foster 
parents or to homes or whatever it was.  And uh, s
o, it had to be organized in such a way that they 

all had to come at a certain day at a certain time in, in order to be ready and then, because the trains 

left approximately I think at 9 or 10 o clock in 
the morning, that's not important, but people had to 
come there to a certain, so the arrangements ha
d to be made with the railway system, and 

arrangements had to made, to be made with th
e police also, so uh, uh, uh, and, we also had taken 
over the responsibility so that the police to keep 
uh order, so that the police should not interfere 
because certainly that was a tense situation because the parents had brought their children in order 

to uh, uh hand them over into our custody to, to tr
ansport them to England.  So, uh, uh, uh, I saw all 
the transports which left Berlin I saw off because it was my function to see to it that these things 

were working properly.  So uh, on a typical day we 
asked the parents to come with the children, not 
only from Berlin, from, let us say 
those who were to come  from East
 Prussia or from Bressler also, 
had to travel the night before, but in the morning th
ey all were there.  And, 
that was a very special 
atmosphere in the air of expectation to a certain
 extent, there was laughing and there were tears, 
and there was concern, and at last
, last uh, uh, uh, advice by the mothers what to do and what not to 

do, and then uh, at a certain time when the, the tim
e of departure uh came closer, and we had, as I 
said, reserved wagons which, which had to be f
illed with these children, and the, the police had 

insisted that the parents do not accompany, acco
mpany, uh the uh, the uh children to the railways 
because there were certain difficulties, uh, they in
sisted that the goodbye had to be done uh, not in, 
in, in, in uh, in public. So, uh, uh, uh and, the time 
of departures came closer, then I, I was 
ascending a chair there, that was my -------------, 
and I asked the uh parents uh then that, I 

addressed the parents, and told them that the 
day of departure has come , and they should say 
goodbye because we'r e on a strict uh order by the poli
ce uh to take, just to take the children up to 
the rail, uh railways, and they have to remain
 there, and uuuuuh, that I ask for their cooperation, 
their understanding, because only that uh, that their be
havior would guarantee the continuity of our 
operations.  So, um, um, then the parents sa id goodbye, and again ther
e was laughing and crying 

and a last hug, and, but uh, later when I asked very 
often to myself the ques
tion, how did I have the 

 
 
courage to say that to the parents, I only can 
answer that at this time we didn't know and we 
couldn't even foresee, we couldn't surmise for a mome
nt  that for many or most it would be the last 
goodbye, that most of those children would never see 
their parents again, and that a year and a half 
later, fr om that same, same station or the same 
railways, the trains which now were rolling with the 
children towards the West... 
 

We  have to stop because we just ran out.  We  have to do that part again. 

 

beep. 

 

So let's back up to where you were talking about the goodbyes, and that no one could foresee this. 

 

Yes, I said then that as the time of departure 
came closer, when I was ascending a chair, telling the 
parents that now the time for goodbye has come, that we ask for their cooperation because we are 

under strict order by the police (clears throat) not to let the chil--the uh parents uh come to the uh, 

to the uh, uh, uh railroad, the railways, uh because they
 didn't want to uh have uh this see the public 
because they wanted to avoid any scenes in public.  And, I asked them for their cooperation 

because uh the continuity of our work depended on th
eir behavior.  So there were tears, and there 
was laughter, and there was a last, there were
 hugging and kissing, but uh, 
this was??? a tense 
situation, no doubt, but uh, the children oh, most of th
e children were in a some  kind of a mood of 

expectation, and uh, the parents tried to uh, to control 
their emotions, to, to show they are, they are 
courageous, uh, uh, in order to ma ke it, not  have
, to make it more difficult for the children.  And, 

um, very often after that I have 
asked myself the question where did I take the courage from to tell 
these uh people to say uh goodbye, uh, and the answer 
to that is just that uh none of us, nobody of 

us, could foresee even at this moment that for most of the children and most 
of the parents, it would 
be the last goodbye.  That a year and a half later 
or so, from over the same railways where the train 
uh left uh to take the children to a new country 
and to freedom and liberty, the trains would roll 
towards the East and take them, the parents, uh t
o, to the, human slaughterhouses in Auschwitz and 
other places.  Uh, we had of 
a certain, uh, uh, attempts uh were made uh, uh also -------- received 
the permission, our own escorts could accompany the, the children because  the moment when the 

children said goodbye, the escorts took over, they were
 carefully selected, mainly teachers, we had 
some , some  uh young doctors and so uh children docto
rs  and so, who were not busy because they 

had lost their, their, their, th
eir permits, their license, um, to go with these children, and uh, I myself 
did it because last not least I wanted to see how 
it's working.  We found, for instance, out that at 
one place where the train --------------- in the direction 
to England from Berlin, past the border uh 
line of Bendheim, the SS uh, acting as customs offi
cials, acted like vandals, uh, not touching the 

 
 
children, but, but tearing all the luggage apar
t and looking for valuables and so on, which uh 
frightened certainly the children tremendously 
but there's nothing, nothing we could do.  But the 
mome nt we came to Holland, for instance, uh, we 
were received by wonderful human beings who 
uh, uh were the committee, and they treated the ch
il- the children with chocolate and sweets and 
cake and, and all kinds of goodies, and uh, then uh, uh, the trains rolled uh towards the uh these 

places from which the ferry went to England, uh that was to Herrich in England.  Uh, as I said, I 

went a couple of times in order to see what can 
be done to improve the uh technicalities, and then, 
then if necessary to change the procedure.  Ther
e are 2 stories I'd like to tell in connection there 
with, I've never forgotten.  Uh, one was when we 
uh ca-uh uh in, after a coupl
e of months of these 
transports, a couple of these transports had left
, we were twice by the 
uh chamber of commerce I 
think, it was in England.  Then too ma ny goods we
re taken into England, uh, uh, uh, uh considered 
me rchandise to be sold in England, uh, and that
 uh, the uh Chamber of Commerce did not like that. 
 Sure enough, parents had given their, their children 
all kind of valuables, uh, not, not, not jewels or 
so, but things they, they, they, they like them 
to take with them ph-photo cameras and so, which 
cous, could be uh taken along, money certainly was 
not allowed, the mi nimum, or the maximum of 

money you would take out at this time were 10 ma
rks, which was nothing, hardly a pound or half a 
pound.  So, uh, the people came with va
luable music instruments and things like that.  And in one 
occasion when I was uh the uh, the uh, in charge of 
this transport, we landed in Herrich, and uh, the 
customs, uh, inspected, they were very generous, 
uh, but certainly they did their job, and uh, then I 
heard my name called, and I came to the cusom 
official, and uh, uh, he said, "Sir, we have a 
problem here."  I said, "What is the problem? "   
and he said, "Well, here's a young ma n, and he has 
a very very valuable violin."  Well it was not certainly a Stradivarius or a Vonari or Tomatus? ??? 

but it was obviously an Italian violin, and I sa
id, "Well, I cannot understand, you have to kindly 
understand
????? uh the 
uh the, the boy loves music, and, and th
e parents gave him, gave him a, a 
violin, and he likes to practice music.  I didn't 
know that the boy was able to play it.  So, uh, the 
customs official still was very doubtful, and I we
nt there to him and sa
id, "Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, let 
me help you and convince you that the boy loves music, and let him play if you may, if I may."  He 

said, "It's all right. Why not? "   And as I say, 
I was sweating, uh, uh, cold sweat because I wasn't  
sure.  So, I asked the boy then in German, "Are you ab
le to play? "   He said, "Sure."  And then he 
started to play, and I didn't realize in my exc
iteme nt what he was going uh, uh playing, but all of 
the sudden I saw that the custom official starte
d uh acting, and that the people, the British people 
around him became silent, and there was complete silence in that area, and then I realized  that the 

boy had started to play "God Save the King."  And, 
when I got aware of that, then I thought it was a 
little bit embarrassing, I wanted to stop him, but th
at boy was eager, he wanted, he played all 3 
stanzas of the National Hymn, and the people, and 
the activities there in Herrich, in the customs uh 
area stopped, and when he was finished, and 
uh, uh, uh operations started again, I asked the 

 
 
customs, said, "Are you now convinced  that the boy 
loves music? " He said, "Yes, sir.  Completely. 
Go ahead."  And that's uh the one story I, I, I, 
I have still very much in my memory.  The other is 
uh, uh shows the, the, the uh kind of human reaction 
which I appreciated tremendously, I love to, to 
tell it again and again.  We were under the rules not
 to admit uh, uh to take children on a transport 
over the age of 17.  In other words, if they ha
ve completed the age of 18, they couldn't go on the 
transport.  So, uh, on one of these transports when 
I was in charge of it, and during the night when 
we ma de the ferry from uh, uh Flushing to Herrich, 
we worked in order to bring all these papers 
into shape, the permit cards in alphabetical order 
and so, so that the children shouldn't wait too long 
because uh it was a long uh train ride, and there 
was a, was a night in which, uh, they wouldn't 
sleep too long, and so, so we were working, in the 
lounge of the, of the sh
ip? ? , and uh, all of the 
sudden one of my friends said, uh, came to me  and sa
id, "Norbert, I think we have a problem here." 

I said, "What is the problem? "   He said, "Here the uhhh, permit, the landing permit said that this 

fellow is over 18 years old."  I looked at it and I 
couldn't believe my eyes because it had passed the 
inspection of all of us.  So, we went into a huddle and, and, we, we asked the boy to come  down, 

and said there must be a mi stake.  So, the boy 
had already gone to sleep, and when they brought 
him down, I almost fainted because I saw that 
he came down, uh, with his hair shaven, which 
indicated to me that he had been taken in Nove
mber uh to a concentration camp, had been released 
after a certain time and probably was under the order 
of the Gestapo to leave, to leave Germany, or 
would be taken again into the camp.  And we went 
to them after having seen that uh, we went into 
a huddle with the uh, with our, with our escorts, delib
erating what can we do to save the situation. 
And there were two opinions:  one said, uh, that uh, we should reveal it and throw ourselves at the 

mercy of the civil servants, and the other, and I was uh one of those, said well, we'll simply do 

something else, we'll play a trick.  We'll say that
 there was a mi stake of the German police, and, 
and, and uh that they had made a mi stake, a
nd ---------, but that means that the boy had to be 
convinced that he really was one year younger.  So we explained it that that boy was standing in 

front of us, he knew that some thing was wrong, a
nd he was just shaking like a shaky bone, and I 
was, I felt terribly sorry.  So he was, and he was 
a...sma rt fellow.  He was given to understand that 
when he will be asked how old he is, that he shoul
d then say that he was born year earlier, one year 
before, and uh, we even uh, arranged that that 
during the night some body should wake him up to ---
-----, to ask him, "When were you born? " and then
 he should answer.  S
o, we landed the next 
morning in Herrich, and ----------, suddenly, all of the sudden immi gration said, "Mr. Wollheim," 

said, the official said, uh, "Sir, uh, there must be a terrible mi stake. 

 

We have to reload. 

 

Beep. 

 
 
 
Okay.  Let's back up just a little bit. 

 

Well, um, the decision has been made to say it was 
a mi stake, and to try to
 smuggle him in.  So, the 
next morning, we didn't sleep too much, we 
landed in Herrich, and uh, sure enough, soon, there 
was a, was a, was a, I heard a voice saying, "Mr. 
Wollheim, the immi gration officer would like to 
see you."  So, uh, and I knew what was comi ng.  So, 
uh, uh, he showed me this permit, and said uh, 
uh, "Listen Sir, I cannot admit this uh boy.  U
h, this young ma n, because uh, under the rules and 
regulations uh, uh he is not entitled to it."  And he poi nted out to the date.  A
nd I said, "Uh, sir, this 

must have been a mi stake.  Uhhh, because uh we checked carefully, and that cannot be.  And, uh, 

kindly asked the boy himself, so, this boy came and 
he was certainly all and shaking in his boots, 
and he was white like uh, newly culped wool? ? , white on his face and sh-really shivering, and that 

immi gration officer looked at him,
 and I could see that something was working within him, and he 
said, he asked me , "You really mean that the Ge
rman police, which was famous for accuracy and 
reliability is making mi stakes? "  And I told him, "Y
es, sir, because don't forget we'r e already so and 
so many years after the Nazi regime, and the quality of those people they are now serving is not the 

same  anymore."  He said, "Uh-huh."  Then he l
ooked again at us, and he asked me, "Do you take it 
on your responsibility to say that this is a mi stake,
 and that the boy was born 
one year earlier, and 
without waiting, I said, "Yes sir, I 
do."  And there was a long time of silence. And I realized that he 
knew I was lying, and I knew that 
he knew that I was lying.  And he looked at the boy again, and 
he looked at the card, and after certain moments, 
which was a mome nt of life and death for that 
boy, he took out the stamp, 'Admitted to Unite
d Kingdom,' and he was admitted under false 

pretenses, uh, which means, uh, the man knew, the ci
vil servant, uh that uh, uh, in this situation, uh, 
a human gesture would be of tremendous importance,
 and if I say that, because probably this man 
is not around anymore, but he has earned his place in heaven. 

 

How ma ny children altogether did you rescue, and, how did that ma ke you feel?  

 

Well, um, I think the war broke out, which, uh by th
e way, I went, I went also to, to Sweden a 
couple of times because Sweden took a s-a couple 
of small groups into their country, uh, but, we 
were able to bring out just of Germany, and we
 were not allowed to work with the people in 

Austria or in, in Czechoslovakia, but we uh, 
war broke out, I think when we had reached 
approxima tely the, the, the number of 7000.  Um, 
the only thing I can say that uh, uh, certainly I, 
when I came to London, and my friends there are, uh, 
and I told them that I'm going back to uh to 
uh to Germany, uh, and, and I had a privilege uh, to fly back, which at this time was a sensation. 

Flying was not a daily uh, a daily affair, uh, and they
 said, "Are you out of your mi nd? "  Uh, I said, 

 
 
"Well, I can't  help it because uh, we are under the 
obligation, and I've given my word to serve as 
long as I can, and, and also uh, uh, it was so I ha
d my parents still living in in uh, in in uh, uh 
Germany.  I had a sister for which I felt responsib
le, and certainly my wife and my child, and so 
that I didn't have a right to desert them and to stay in England, uh, and also it would have meant 
certainly that the operation would be, mi ght co
me  to an end, and would be the uh, would be 
damage, so uh, as I say, I'm, I'm, I'm glad that I di
d it.  I'm very proud of it.  I paid a p-a certain 

price for it, but nobody could foresee because the ma
n, who, when he asked me  to help him, and 
promised me, made a commitment to him--------------to 
get out of Germany.  Uh, uh, uh, a year or a 
year and a half later, after the war broke out, 
he was taken uh, uh to the concentration camp of 
Mauthausen, and murdered in cold blood there.   

 

Now let's go to before 1938 and 1939.  How did life change, both gradually and suddenly?  

 

Well, uh, you have to go back a little bit uh furt
her because, because uh, nobody can forget that, uh, 
there was a life in Germany and a Jewish life before Hitler, and it was a very active life, especially 

in the community where I grew up.  We had a 
thriving community, an active community, and I 
participated as a young man, as a member of the Je
wish Youth Moveme nt.  Um, we uh, Berlin also, 
and I enjoyed it especially as a student, uh, I b
ecame a student of law in 1931.  Uh, Berlin was uh, 
uh a center of cultural activity.  In 
the field of music, field of literature, field of theater, and uh, we 
fully uh participated in that, and really enjoyed it 
to the best of our ability.  And even when we are 
students that didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't have the uh, the means to attend all the operas, uh because 

it was too expensive for us, and we just uh, went 
there, and we could do that, uh played, played uh, 
uh, uh people on the stage.  Uh, we were not paid 
for that, but we had opportunity to, to listen and 
to participate.  So, it was very active.  After 1933, and that' interesting, 
um, uh, things uh, uh, went 
in waves.  The first enemies Hitler took care of
 were not the Jews; were the unions, were the 
political parties like the uh social democratic, demo
cratic, and the communist parties.  For them, 
uh, he established the concentration camps.  Certainly there was on April 1, 1933, we had the 

events of so-called boycotts, which uh, uh gave us 
for the first time an inkling what mi ght come 
out, but we though, uh, and I was not alone in this respect
, that this is just a transitory thing.  That 
uh, Hitler cannot prevail, that for economical reas
ons he will not be able to uh, to remain the 
Chancellor of Germany.  That uh, the, the countries
 like England and France (America at this time 
uh didn't play a role in Europe) would not let him, 
let him uh threaten them.  And that uh, therefore, 
we just had  to have to the cou-not the courag
e, we had the, the uh, uh stamina to hold out.  Uh, 
then uh, things uh, uh, uh, also uh ma ny people thought di
fferently, then tried to get out, to get out 
was not easy, the world was not open.  America 
had caught us, people who'd try to get into 

Palestine needed at least 10,000 pounds.  And, uh, 
uh, uh people would try to get into South 

 
 
America and so, had terrible difficulties, so, i-i
mmi gration was not, not a ------, an easy thing. 
When we had the Olympic Games in Berlin in
 1936, things almost looked norma l, though, before 
we had the Nuremberg Laws, and we thought, after 
that, we could somehow settle on the fact that, 
all right we would not be, not be citizens like, like 
the others, but, who wanted to be a citizen?  The, 
the, the, the Democratic regime of the Weim
ar Republic, which had come  to an end, uh, uh, uh, uh, 
didn't allow people under, had come  to an end 
and, people under Hitler anyhow did not participate 
actively in any kind of political life.  Uh, uh, it was a totalitarian, uh, country, and we were not 

interested.  We uh, we built, on the other hand, a 
tremendously active Jewish life.  There were, uh, 
uh, institutions of Jewish learning uh, were create
d.  A, a tremendous amount of uh books of Jewish 
content were printed.  We  had our own Jewish 
cultural activities.  Uh, people who had, I wouldn't 
say lost the faith, but, who had moved away so
me how, all of the sudden came  back.  Uh, the 

Jewish sports organizations became very active. In other words, it was a 
kind of life uh, almost uh, 
uh, an automono--an autonomous uh, uh, uh life within
 the parameter of our abilities.  Um, which 
uh, was deceiving certainly, but, nobody certainly at th
is time could foresee what will, what at 
least, uh, I don't have, have me t anybody who, w
ho, who, uh, who, who would say that, who would 
say that he could exactly foresee Auschwitz or, or Treblinka or Majdanek.  And, uh, then when 

Hitler uh had attained more power in Europe, partly due to the weakness of the allies, uh, and that 

after, especially after he stretched his muscles, and, and, and that, and that first Austria, and then, 

then Czechoslovakia, then things uh, uh became mo
re serious, and, and it became clear that the uh, 
the uh, work outside... 

 

(Sandy says some thing) 

 

Oh, I'm sorry. 

 

beep. 

 

Uh, I would say that we conducted in German so
me kind of restricted, almost normal life. 
Restricted uh because we didn't uh, uh, we were not
 politically active, but there was only one party, 
and there was only one totalitarian regime, so who 
cared.  But we were left  to ourselves, some how. 
With, with, with certain control and all this
, but uh, uh, ma ny things were produced which were, 
which, which were, really an achieveme nt, esp
ecially in the field of education.  Uh, the 

organizations, for instance, training people for immi gr
ation to Israel, were active, and trained the --
----------- and the young people, the pioneers who want to go out and so.  Uh, there were 2 different 

opinions in, in Germany at this time still prevaili
ng.  One would believe that
 it's just a matter of 
time, and the regime mi ght collapse, and the othe
rs who said, "No, uh we wa
nt to get out because 

 
 
uh, uh, we don't see any future, especially for our ch
ildren," and that was especially certainly true 
for the professionals who had lost their license 
like lawyers and doctors and so on.  An indication 
that the uh thumbs? ?  were tightened more and more--we got in 1938, I would say, which certainly 
had something to do with the political success of Hitle
r on the world scene, also with the fact that 
probably the radical elements within the Nazi
 party thought the time has come to uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, 
uh, uh realize their param--uh, uh, uh, uh, uh concerning the Jews.  And, uh, in 38, you had a 

development where uh, uh business which was still open, retail business, and, to a certain extent, 

even dept stores, then changed hands, and uh, Jews  uh left the boards of bi
g corporations, and uh, it 

started uh and, and then uh I would say the total 
change came with the ev
ents of November 10, uh, 
uh which uh received a mi snomer was  Crystal Night.  It is actually the uh, I call it a night of 

shame, and ------------, it's interesting that in Germa
ny, this expression Crystal Night is not being 
used.  Uhhhhh, I must say, I'm grateful for that. 
 Uh, but then when, when we saw uh what we 
couldn't believe, that Germany which after all was 
considered for, for, for all of us, who were 
educated at German high schools, German universitie
s, that Germany was once considered a center 
of civilization, uh, had handed over the uh power of
, of, of uh governme nt to thugs and to, to 
people who, who replaced uh the, 
applied uhh, the political means of violence.  And uh, uh, this uh, 
and it was right what the then leader of the 
uh, uh German Jewish community, Rabbi Beg? ? , who 
was my teacher and spiritual mentor said, I think, at
 this time, that the historical hour of German 
Jewry, which had lasted almost 2000 years, ha
d come  to an end.  And, uh, then uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, 
started the, the running, uh trying to find a, a place 
somewhere outside.  I, myself, uh, in connection 
therewith, uh, uh, uh tried to learn a trade like weld
ing.  Um, but the uh, the 
world was more or less 
closed, and, uh, we were, we were  um, jealous of
 all those who had found a, a way uh, especially 
after the November events, uh, England took in 
uh, uh, ten thousand children, and it is to their 

honor, I must say that, in spite of all the polic
y Mr. Chamberlain had followed before with his 
appeasement, and his famous uh peace, when he ca
me  back from Munich, uh that he had seen Herr 
Hitler, and he had brought back peace on our time,
 um, but uh, uh, uh, uh America remained closed 
because there were quotas, and uh, uh also, uh, uh, ot
her countries closed their doors so um, um 
just the, the will to get out wa
s not enough.  Uh, also you have to have, find a country which was 
willing to receive you, and that didn't exist.  And 
there are many infamous cases, one of them, for 
instance, the chapter of the St. Louis, the boat wh
ich went out from, from Germany with refugees, 
uh, came to Cuba, and Cuba--Batista
 at this time, the head of the uh, uh--------government, declared 
the visas as invalid.  The boat 
could not uh disembark the passengers.  The uh captain turned the 
boat around after a certain time hoping that the uh, th
e Jewish organization 
would, would help, and 
that governme nts would come  to his help.  The boa
t actually cruised before the coast of Miami. 
The people on the boat saw the lights of Miami B
each, but America refused entry.  And therefore 
the people had to be taken back to uh Germany, and uh, the Captain uh who was really a hero, then 

 
 
very, very slow, hoping that a solution could be
 found, and then eventually uh, uh, uh, uh, uh ended 
that, uh, in this way that, that France and Belgiu
m and Holland and England agreed to take so and 
so ma ny of these uh, uh, uh, uh refugees, uh, but cer
tainly uh, ma ny of them, who, who landed in 
France and in Belgium and Holland, later were overrun by the Germans when they conquered these 

countried.  So, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh with
 the November events, uh, there was a complete change, and 

also, we then realized, especially when we work
ed, those of us who to save the children, that uh 
war mi ght be immi nent.  And, uh, the, the, the speed
 of our work was dictated uh also very strongly 
by the fact that uh, uh, we had to t-try to comp
lete the job before uh, uh, uh there would be uh, uh 

this terrible thing called war.  And, uh, uh, uh, af
ter Jews in Germany, and I can only speak for 
them, were thrown out of their positions after N
ovember, uh, they were drawn into what I called, 

we called later, uh, uh, uh, uh slave labor, uh, uh, uh, take
n into labor gangs as trench boat workers, 
diggers, and so on, and uh that was the situation uh, uh, uh prevailing between, I would say, 

November of 38 to the beginning of the war, which was September 1939.  (Sigh) 

 

Now, looking back on all you experienced, how str
ongly do you feel about revenge, especially in 
Auschwitz?   How did you feel about it. 

 

Um...I've been asked that question about revenge uh 
a couple of times last month these, when I was 

giving evidence in, in, in, in criminal procedures 
against the uh the uh the uh 
criminals, the, the, 
the, not war criminals, but uh the, the, the, 
those who had been -------------, were, were, were, were 
brought to trial.  The uh the uh, uh SS gangsters of
 Auschwitz and so on.  Um, I personally, I can't 
speak only personally, I never felt revenge.  Uh, becau
se this was not part 
of our education.  Uh, 
contempt, yes.  I have a con, a deep contempt for 
especially those, those, those people who talked 
so much about their heroism, the heroism of the Nord
ic race and all that, and then at the same time, 
they who were not fighting at the front, were 
fighting children, old me n, and, and, and wome n.  Uh, 
I also say that uh, uh, was, it's part, I think, of theheritage of which I am 
very, very proud.  On the 
day of the liberation, and I liberat
ed myself together with some  friends, by running away from my 
killers, to the uh American forces operating in Northern Germany near Shrelin--8th Division on 

the, I think the comma nd of General Geffin, wonderful uh ma n.  Uh, when we got into the city of 

Shrelin, and when the Americans had taken ove
r Shrelin on May 3, 1945, you could find all kinds 
of German weapons there, from mi ssi---from, from
, from, from pistols to machine guns, to the to 
the to the bazookas--whatever it was.  You coul
d grab them, and you could start your own private 
war.  And, uh, uh I'm certain that 
if we would uh, there the, the German soldiers surrendered en 
ma sse to the Americans, uh, and they were ve
ry happy to surrender to them, and not to the 

Russians because also they were under the mi scon
ception that the American would welcome them, 
uh, and ask them to turn around in order to fight the war against the Russians. Uh, we uh, when we 

 
 
uh, uh, amongst those who surrendered there were cer
t-certainly quite a number of SS me n, and SS 
guards and so on.  And if we had taken any of
 these weapons there and just killed these uhhhhh, 
criminals, I'm certain, uh, especially under th
e circumstances prevailing in these days, nobody 
would uh, uh have had objections, I guess.  But we didn'
t do it.  It was not part
 of our education.  It 
was not part of our value system. 
 Uh, because we believed that one day there would be justice, and 
justice should be meted out by ther proper author
ities, and that would be it.  That we were 
disappointed by ma ny of these procedures... 
 

Let's reload. 

 

Beep. 

 

You may search the historical records of those 
days, especially after the liberation, and you will 
find, do not find one case in which a liberated form
er concentration camp inmate had taken revenge 
against, uh, an SS guard, personally.  Uh, because, yes, 
that's what we believed in, in justice.  In a 
proper uh, uh, uh, uh court of justice uh, these people ha
d to, would had to answer for their crimes. 
Uh, but we were later became rather disappointe
d, uh, especially with a practice uh in Nuremberg, 
where, uh, people were sentenced, and then very earl
y released, even if they were guilty like hell. 
Including the uh, the tycoons of German industry, th
at's another chapter, a regrettable chapter, 
which is a part of American history, I'm sorry to say. 

 

Can you talk about your own personal feelings at 
liberation--the mi xture of joy and sadness, the 
realization you're alone. 

 

Well, uh, certainly uh, uh, uh, I remember that ve
ry well uh, that morning of, of uh May 3, 1945 

when we saw the American fl
ag hoisted uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, in, in, hanging from the trees in the 
forest near Shrelin, and then we realized that we
 had been just rebor, uh, and had uh received a new 
lease on life.  Uh, I remember uh we, we embraced 
each other.  I was in a 
small group of uh people, 
and, and we were laughing and we 
were crying, and, was a tremendous uh, uh feeling of relief, but 

also of burden because uh we realized that uh 
this mome nt for which we had waited years and 
years, we couldn't share with uh, those of us who 
had deserved it--our own families.  And we rea-
realized also something else, especially the Jewi
sh uh, uh persecutees, that we had no home left to 
go to.  I, personally, knew that going back to 
Berlin would be a hopeless--I couldn't find anybody 
anymore.  And I was uuhhh, theref
ore, uh, I had to settle for a certain transitory existence 
somewhere else.  I knew I wouldn't stay in 
Germany, because for me , Germany was one big 
cemetery.  And therefore, uhhhhhhh, it, it, it, it was esp
ecially, and this is the specific situation for 

 
 
the, for the survivors, for the Jewish survivor
s.  The world was celebrating, I remember how 
jubilant the Frenchmen were amongst us when he 
saw the tricolor hanging from uh, from the roofs 
in Shrelin, and they were dancing.  We couldn't dance. We had no right to dance.  So, that was the 
mome nt of, of, of, of tremendous elation, but also
 tremendous sadness, and, every one of us uh felt 
uh, uh, we were grateful to the Allies who had liber
ated us, but we were alone.  Uh, individually 
alone.  And uh, uh, uh, uh...looking into a future uh, 
uh, uh, uh, in, in which we, we had hoped will 

come  one day, but we didn't know at the mome nt how to handle it. 

 

Can you describe for me some of the different kinds
 of camps that existed.  People don't realize that 
there were more than one kind of camp. 

 

We ll, uh, uh, you had in, in, in, in, in the concentra
tion camps have a history. 
 Uh, it started, if I'm 
not mi staken, with the first camp in Dachau in 
Munich.  Then you have one camp at the at the 
beginning of the Nazi time.  Then you had the uh camp near Berlin, Sachsenhausen ---------------, 

where I was after comi ng back from Auschwitz. U
h, there was Buchenwald.  Uh, there were the uh 
the uh, camps in, in the -------------, uh, uh, uh where main
ly political prisoners were kept, but the 

Swool? ?  system changed completely after 
uh, uh, uh Hitler invaded Poland, and uh, uh, then 
entered Russia, and uh...for reasons which are still difficult to analyze, uh, the extermination camps 

were not established in Germany proper, but 
on Polish soil, like Auschwitz and Treblinka and 
Majdanek and Sobibór and ---------.  We had gas ch
ambers.  Crematoriums they had in all the 
camps, but gas chambers you did not.  And the ma jo
r centers of extermination, which I call human 
slaughterhouses, were just Auschwitz and Treblinka and Majdanek. 

 

What about all of the work camps?   What was the fate of the people in the work camps?  

 

Well, there were, there were different uh, uh, I'm 
not familiar with ---------- because I never, never, 
never uh, uh, if I ma y say so, served in them.  Ther
e were certain labor camps, for instance, uh, at 
the beginning, uh people were taken out
 of the, of Polish cities, Jews were taken out to help to 

build the Audubon, the uh the uh highways and so on.  Uh, and they were, some  of those camps 

were not guarded by SS, were guarded by 
the so-called -------------------.  They were certain 
different, different, different kinds
 of treatment.  All this came to
 an end later when Himml er uh, 
uh, uh, and especially the SS Economical Dept uh, uh 
was in charge of, of, of the camps because 
for the SS, uh, don't forget this, these camps, to a certain extent, was a good, were a good uh source 

of income .  Uh, for instance, in our camp, in, in, in Buna, uh, the SS received for each worker 

working in the -------------Factory, a certain amount of 
money.  We , we never saw a penny of that. 
But as --------------- paid a certain amount.  For me, fo
r instance, a little bit more because I was a 

 
 
so-called skilled worker.  Uh, and so, the SS actua
lly  uh, uh had the benefit of the slave labor 
there, uh, which later resulted uh, for instance, in cer
tain suits.  I, after 1951, sued Aichfarben? ?  for 
the non-payment of, of wages to us, but that
's  another story.  Anyhow, uh, the SS uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
managed these camps certainly also for their own uh 
busin--uh profits in monetary form.  It was not 
only uh a place to keep people and t
o, to in, to uh, uh, to prote--uh, for, for security reasons.  There 
was also, uh, they, they uh could uh, uh squeeze out as 
much as they could in order to profit from 
it.   

 

What do you think survival is a matter of?  

 

Sheer luck.  I was once asked by a journalist I should 
explain to him the art of survival.  Uh, there 
is no art on that.  It's a sheer accident.  I kne
w people who were much stronger than I am, uhhhhh, 
who were, who were looked like, like indes, who looked like indestructible human beings, who, 

after a certain while, also lost the uhhhh will to
 live because they have not enough food, or a 
sickness struck, and so, it's like uh, uh, survival, as I 
say, is an accident.  Like uh, like the survival 
of a, of a soldier in battle.  Uh, uh, he mi ght lose
, uh, he mi ght lose a friend to the left, he mi ght 
lose a friend to the right, he himself uh, uh can
 survive. Why?   Nobody knows.  Because, uh, uh, 
uh, uh, on the bullets uh, uh directed at him, there, ther
e is not his name  tag.  Uh, we, we were in, in 
danger of, of death, we lived with death side on si
de.  Uh, even at the last mome nt when, when 
everything was lost already for the Nazis, and wh
en, together with a small group of friends, we 
escaped the killers to reach the American lin
es.  The uh, the uh, the forward section of the 
American lines.  Uh, even then th
ey were still shooting after us.  But, luckily, as I said, our nametag 
was not on the bullets. 

 

What about choices?   You ma de lots of choices which ended in helping you survive. 

 

Yeah, but you never were, uh, know how, how, how 
this will--you never know the result.  You 

know, under norma l conditions, you mi ght uh be able 
to, to uh, to make a reasonable decision, and 
say, "It mi ght result in this, or mi ght result in that
."  Or, as my uh teacher, Leo Begg, always said, 
"People are thinking, um, ahead, and they are, they are planning a hundred different possibilities, 

but the hundred first actually occurs."  U
h, under un-normal conditions, under outrageously un-
normal conditions, uh, for which actually uh the hum
an condition is not prepared, there is no 
choice.  It is sheer luck.  It, and it's, luckily, and I am one of the luckies.   

 

I'd like to do one more roll. 

 

 
 
Okay. 
 

Beep. 

 

Can you talk about the choices of the guards and th
e SS, did they have choices?   Were they only 
following orders?   We re they acting on their own?  

 

Well, I'm not too familiar with the, I'm familiar only 
with the literature I've seen after the war.  Uh, 
there were certain, ch-first of all, I want uh state 
very clearly that uh, uh when the SS or some  of the 
SS me n in these trials pleaded uh, uh, uh, uh innocence 
or, or said that they'r e not guilty because 
they'r e following orders, there's not one case known in
 which an SS ma n refused to serve in a, in a 

concentration camp or a death camp, and was put on tria
l, or was, was, was, 
was shot or whatever it 
is.  Number two, um, amongst the SS uh, uh people, 
there were certain people who uh, uh just tried 
to uh to uh, uh, uh show their heroism by being more
 brutal than the other.  And, uh, interesting 

enough, this uh, uh, this uh, this uh, uh enigma  or it's a mi racle, I don't know, whatever you mi ght 

say, that especially those who originally from Au
stria were more brutal because they were not 
considered by the -----------as, as, as complete heroes, 
and they wanted to show them uh, that they 
can do better.  Uh, so, therefore, uh, uh, in this 
respect, the SS men had cert
ain choices.  Uh, he 
could have done his guard duty, duty probably 
without being uh, uh brut
al.  Uh, but uh, uh, uh, 
many of them volunteered for these services, and, 
and felt very good about it.  Uh, uh...to be a, a 
member of this group uh, uh means that you had to 
have a certain mentality, uh, especially these SS 
guards in, in, in the concentration camps because
 uh, certainly they were, they were programmed 

some how uh because uh, uh they were told uh, over 
the years that uh Jews are vermins and that 
they have to be eradicated, and that uh they are th
e uh, the race, the, the, the Nordic race, they'r e the 
heroic race, and, and, and the Superace, and so, and 
they meant it, and they believed in that.  Uh, 
but it is their fault. 

 

Did you run into one who was kind or helped or saved anyone?  

 

Not that I know. 

 

You saw yourself in the mi rror once when you were in the -------.  Can you describe that. 

 

Well, we had no mi rrors in the camp actually, you know, but um, yes, I, I remember that.  After a 

couple of weeks when I was out of
 these um, um murder commandos, I uh, got a job as an assistant for 
the, for ----------, and was able to work
 in a hole, protected against the elements, and uh, there was also a 

 
 
bathroom which could be used, uh, otherwise we were 
not allowed  to use the bathrooms of the German 
super-superrace, and there found a mi rror, and I looked in
to the mi rror, and I got, I was aghast, I was, I 
couldn't believe myself that that's me.  I, I, uh, uh, not
 only did I, I had uh lost weight, but lost hair, but 
the expression of my eyes and so were unbelie
vable to me .  And, and, and, and um, it was not 
encouraging I would say.  But, uh, on the other hand th
en I said, "Well, uh, if that is so, uh, uh, still uh, 
this cannot kill my spark of life, not at this moment at least.   
 

That spark of life, was there ever, how did you, how
 did all of you relieve yourselves?   Did you ever 
joke, did you ever have... 

 

Well, there was humor, there was real humor also, sure, 
sure, sure.  And, I was, I 
must say, a lot of like, 
I'll tell you the story about my friend, contempt fo
r those people, who, who, 
who we uh, uh, counted out 
of the human race some how if I ma y 
say so.  They themselves con-considered themselves as supermen, 
but, but uh, but we does, didn't agree with them.  Maybe
 that's clear.  Uh, we
 counted them out.  And 
we, we the only questions we, we ra
ised time and again, like my friends, was that uh thank God I, I, I, I 

was not created in the image of those people uh, uh, 
uh try to understand, I, I remember uh discussions I 
had with the, with the British prisoners of war.  I sa
w to it that to give them as much information as 

possible because I told them time and again, "You'll 
probably be able to uh, to uh, to survive because 
you're under the protection of the, the National Cont--
uh, uh Red Cross, and irrespective of the fact that 

the Germans disregard the uh rules and regulations of
 the National Red Cross, but you have more of a 
chance to survive.  And, if you should survive, and we
 shouldn't survive, please
 be aware of this and 

this and this and that,  and I told them about th
e things going on, and the gas chambers and so on.  So 
then one of these people, and they were wonderful, 
these, these boys, said, "Norbert, explain to me one 
thing.  These are, look like ordinary human beings.  
They have eyes like others, they have noses like 

others.  Their mouth is the same. 
 How is this possible? "  And the only answer is, is that you cannot 

explain it.  And I think we, we lack explanation up totoday.  Well, if I may say s
o, especially, in face of 

the uh, revisionists today, and and, 
and writing this history, what happened we know, this is, now it's 
documented, and one day we find another document, and 
so, the facts are established, more or less.  The 
'why' will probably never be established.   

 

Can you talk a little bit about the friendships and the support. 

 

Yes, this, this was a very important 
source of, of ,of resistance if I ma y say so.  That uh, especially with 
uh, with certain people got together  
and said, "Let us try to share whatever we have."  Uh, you want to 
share abundance, it's easy, to, to share a shortage is
 not easy.  And, they called this uh, uh, uh 'Powkas.' 
Where the, where the, where the uh expression cam
e from, I don't know.  So, they uh, uh, there were 

 
 
friendships, and I had certainly my friendships with
 the people who were in my transport, uh or the 
same youth movement.  We tried to always, tried to ge
t together, to find the beds in the same area, and 
they have a word of encouragement 
and so on.  I unfortunately lost all 
of them uh, due to circumstances, 
and that hurt me badly.  Uh, so I was trying then to r
each out to others with whom I established contacts 
and with whom I have contact up to today, as far as
 they survived, because this was very important, 
especially when we were aware that uh, the, that on the military front, things developed in our favor. 
And, uh, I will never forget when uh, the, the, the uh 
news reached us even behind the barbed wire of 
Auschwitz, that the Allies had landed in Normandy, 
and uh, uh, there was a mi stake before because I 
think by some, some, some error, a girl in L
ondon had given out uh, uh, uh a telegram, and later it 

turned out it was a mi stake.  And that also r
eached us.  And the British ----------- and they came next 
morning, and we heard the BBC News uh, uh told us. 
 But, when the landing had occurred, and when 

the uh, when the uh, when the uh, uh, uh, uh bridge had 
had been established, and we knew that uh the 
Germans had not been able to throw the Allies back into the sea, there was tremendous uh feeling of 

elation and joy, and, and it was almost like bread. 
 Uh, it uh, because, because, uh, uh, human beings 
also live on hope, and uh, there was onl
y a question how long would it last that after the invasion in, in, 

in, in, in June 1944, it would take uh time up to May 
45, that Germany would surrender.  This we don't 
didn't expect.  But, it gave us a tremendous lif
t-up, there's no doubt about 
it. And, uh, so, uh, uh, uh, uh, 
you know, in this respect, uh, also I have, I would 
say a word about some thing else, uh, which has 
something to do sprit-spiritual resistance.  I wa
s working in the camp in Auschwitz, uh, doing some  
welding work in the camp proper, and then I heard that the British soldiers had been brought to 

Auschwitz in their own camp and were working on in
 the factory, and I heard this, I asked uh for a 
transfer to a comma ndo where, where, where I could 
meet these British soldiers, which was not easy. 
And, uh, luckily my school English was good enough to 
communicate with them.  They were very 
careful.  The British were very, very careful.  But after a certain while when they
 when they came to the 
conclusion that they can trust you, they became wonderf
ul friends.  There appearance in Auschwitz was 
one element of not only joy, but elation and, and encouragement.  They were healthy, they uh, they uh, 

they uh, they had been transferred from, from North Af
rica to Italy, and from Italy to Upper Silesia, and 

uh, they had uh, the privilege of their Red Cross parcels, which they shared with us to a certain extent. 

 

We  have just run out. 

 

Beep. 

 

Why don't you back up to where you said there were tremendous ------------. 

 

We ll, the fact that when we could, when we saw the British uh soldiers, uh, who encouraged us, 

 
 
and, on the first day when I marched out and they cam
e from, let us say, from the left, and we came 
from the right, they were throwing cigarette packages
 at us, and chocolate packages at us, and they 
gave us uh, they, they said, "Don't worry, you'll be 
home by Christmas."  That was, that was, that 
was like ma nna, it was, was a tremendous amount of encouragement went out from them, and, uh, 
then later when, when we had uh some , the SS 
guards uh were not uh, uh, uh controlling, could not 
control all individual actions anymore, and we trie
d to get to, to somehow have contact with them, 
uh, uh, as I say, I personally uh built a wonderful bond of friendship with them to such extent that 

they had when I, when Auschwitz was evacu
ated on uh January 18, 1945, uh, when the Russians 
approached by the way of Krakow already, I walk
ed out of Auschwitz with British uh army boots, 
and, and British underwear, and uh, uh, uh, uh really, with 
a feeling that that, that uh they meant it. 
As a matter of fact, uh, some of them, I met, I met 
after the war, uh, two of th
em or three of them I 
met when I give evidence in Nuremberg against -----. 
 Also, later I, I kept contact with them, I'm 
still in contact with some of 
them.  And uh, uh, even one day, I was brought over to England uh, 
uh, uh because they had a story of one of them, 
uh, this is your life, a
nd it was a wonderful get-
together with them because these were rather si
mple people, but wonderful solid people with, with, 
with character, and they some how uh extended the 
uh, the uh hand of solidarity
 of ma n, to these, 
uh, uh, to the, to us, to the prisoners, who were
 who were who were w
ho were, who had lost 
everything, but they gave us a tremendous amount
 of courage and encouragement and, and uh, uh, 

uh this is a chapter, which up to now has not 
been described.  I hope one day it will be done 

because uh, I said it on that occasion when I wa
s uh, uh invited to London, that England can be 
very, very proud of these me n, who were, who 
really proved that even in Auschwitz uh, uh 
humanity could prevail. 

 

Can you describe for me  what were chances 
of survival were being ---------------- based on your age 
and your sex.  I think most people don't realize wh
at your chances were a child or if you were a 
certain age. 

 

Well, certainly that's, there, there are 2 groups 
of people who had no chance, and always no chance. 
These were the children and these were the elde
rly.  Uh, and, also for those uh who were uh, uh 
brought to Auschwitz, uh mothers with children uh 
had no chance either.  Those who were, who 

were still capable to work, as long as they were 
capable to work, and able to work, had a certain 
slim chance, but they had a chance, how long it 
lasted, that was uh a ma
tter of, of, of uh, uh, uh 
daily destiny, I would say.  Because in the morn
ing you wouldn't know if you would be able to see 
uh, to see uh, to reach uh the evening, and on th
e evening you wouldn't uh, uh be sure that you 
would uh, be able to, to see the sun, in the next
, the sun going up the next morning because death 
was a constant companion.  But, uh, uh, uh, uh, this was, this, this was, this was more or less the, 

 
 
uh, call it the uh, the uh, uh like an assaulting factor
 uh, uh, only the able-bodied, as long as they 
were able-bodied, had a chance to survive.   
 

When you say the children and you say the elderly, what are you talking about in terms of age?  

 

I would say, uh, there are certain cases at the age 
of 10 pretended to be 12 
or 14, and they ma naged 
to, but these are, these are uhhhhh, a 
few cases.  Uh, elderly, well, there was one camp in, in, in 
Czechoslovakia called Theresienstadt or Terezi
n, where uh elderly people uh, uh found their place, 
and also, uh people who had uh, uh r
eceived the decoration as veterans of WWI .  That was at a 
certain time, and, and uh, even the Red, the Nati
onal Red Cross was fooled by going in there and 
reporting that that how wonderful uh the existen
ce (coughs), not how wonderful, but the existence, 
there was bearable, so the Nazis tricked them in
to them even uh, uh organized shows and so, and 
after the Red Cross had left, they sent the people 
to Auschwitz.  Uh, and, but, uh, the, the, so the e-
elderly could exist for a certain while in Th
eresienstadt, but many died there already on 
malnutrition, exhaustion, sickness and so on.  But th
en, starting especially in 1944, also the elderly 
from Theresienstadt was sent to Auschwitz 
for extermination. So uh, you know the uh the policy 
of, of the Nazis uh changed constantly, but the goa
l, the main goal, uh, to exterminate the Jewish 
people, remained.   

 

Can you talk about how Kapos could be good or not good. 

 

Yes, I mean, this is also a mat-a matter of 
uh, uh human, human disposition.  Uh, there were, I 
reme mber, uh Kapos who were rude, rude
 to uh, uh who uh who 
uh, uh, uh, uh, had, uh, who, 
ought to be, or were, were to be treated like 
the Nazis themselves, but I also knew people who 
really tried to, to do the best in order to hel
p, no doubt.  Uh, a Kapo I know had become  a, a, a, a 
curse word, to a certain extent.  It is not fair.  In general you can say that uh, not all uh, uh passed 

the test, but uh, I can vouch for it th
at ma ny tried to behave, and tried to help, and, and, and, and uh 
had kept their reputation intact. 

 

Can you tell me what an appel is. 

 

An appel is a roll call.  In other words, uh, 
uh since the Nazis were so eager on security, uh, 
especially when I came to uh to uh, uh Auschwitz
, we had at least  twice uh, a roll when the 
morning before we went out to work, in the ev
ening when we came back, and uh, uh, so technically 
what happened, uh so happened that each com, 
each block, each uh, uh barrack, uh had its own 

place where there, where people were counted, a
nd uh, after they were counted, then the whole 

 
 
camp was called to attention, and the number uh in
mates was reported to uh or to the commandant. 
Now, uh, when the, when the figures tied in pr
operly, uh, uh, it lasted twenty, twenty-five mi nutes, 
half an hour or so. When, when, but when the fi
gures did not tie in, then it could last hours and 
hours uh, uh when they discovered uh their mi stake, a
nd that was uh, uh rain or shine, in the winter, 
during the summer, irrespective of this, uh, 
under the German motto that "-----------------," which 
means "there must be order."  And only when they
 were satisfi ed that the fi gures were tying in 
completely then they, they, they released uh to, to, to, to retire to our barracks. 

 

Well, that's all? 

 

I could go on, but... We  have to room
 tone again.  That means we have to stay quiet.  We'r e doing 
room tone, Brett! 

 

This is without motor.
