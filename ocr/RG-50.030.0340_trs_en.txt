Question:  Why don't  you start by te
lling us your name , your date
 of birth, where you were born, 
and perhaps you should give me your name at that
 time .  If you want to also say I am--. 
Answer:  Okay, my na me was Bella Maschinsky at
 that point, but I was born Bella Berger on 
September 9, 1922.  I lived in Lodz, 
which is the largest 
industrial city in 
Poland.  I had a little 
sister.  My immediate family, fath
er, mother, little sister and awhole slew of uncles, aunts, 
cousins and so on.  And, I was going to school in
 Poland.  I felt pretty much comfortable in 
Poland.  Someti mes I wondered whether I was more
 Polish than Jewish or those things were 
parallel and did not have an 
affect personally on me .  Also, I knew about anti-semitism and 
Poland did not touch me  personally. 
 I was going to school.  I had lo
ts of friends.  I had Jewish 
friends, non-Jewish friends, and I was never di
rectly involved in Judaism.  Also, my 
grandparents were very religious.  So, I felt oka
y in Poland, even knowing that there is anti-
semitism, because Poles were anti-semitic fr om day one, probably before they are born they are 
anti-semitic.  But it was not an obvious kind of th
ing I personally expe rienced.  Until 1939, let -- 
Q. I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.  

What kind of business you father was in? 

A. My father was working.  He was an insura
nce salesman.  My grandfather had a factory 
which ma de bricks and my uncles were very involv
ed in textiles. They were fairly comfortable 
off, not rich, rich like a lot of Jews in Lodz we
re, but they were comfortable.  Politically, I was 
exposed to the discussions of my
 aunts and uncles.  I had about 
four or five uncles and three 
aunts, and they all belonged to a different politic
al group.  They were zionists.  My father was a 
______________, so Israel was not some thing he woul
d think about or Pa lestine, at that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340

particular time.  He felt we should be ha
ppy where we are and the whole __________ idea.  He 
was the only one of the whole lot.  I had one 
uncle who was very hasidic.  You know, had the 
long _________ and the whole bit.  So, I was alwa ys
 exposed to those discussions, even as a 
little gi rl .  Not that  I participat ed, I was not
 a joiner.  I was not 
zionist, I was not a 
_____________.  I was just a happy go lucky young girl 
with friends and school, and that's  how 
I related to life in Poland. 

Q. Before 1939, were you aware of Hitler and Nazism?  

A. I was aware of Hitler, oh, I would say '38 when the fi rst surge of German Jews were just 

packed on the border of Poland.  And the Jewi
sh community Lodz, and I imagine some place 
else too, was very attuned to it, 
very charitable.  So, they were
 trying to place those refugees 
from Ger ma ny, open kitchens, those people were
 dumped on the border without anything, just 
whatever they could carry.  So, 
they tried to place them in hom
es and ope ned kitchens to feed 
them, and that's when I really became aware that 
that's what Hitler is doing.  I heard about the 
crystal night, but I wasn't  terribl y into it.  By 
end of '38, '39 I became petr
ified of Hitler because 
all of a sudden the anti-se mitism in Poland, which was pretty dorma nt, fl ared up.  So, we started 

to be called name s and it became very uncomfortable and not reassuring to be a part of it.  So, 

yes, that's when I really became 
aware of it, and before that I 
was really interest ed in Polish 
history.  We  were taught Polish history five times
 a week.  Piercutsky (ph) was hey, God.  When 
he died, I reme mber we had stay salute the portrait of him and tears were running down our eyes 

because oh, how her father almost died, which 
was an illusion, but I guess I was not that 
sophisticated at that time.  So, I was aware, and th
e closer it came to '39 or the mi ddle of '39 the 
more aware I was of it.  Until th
e last  week in August I was in the country with my little sist er 
and mother and then we had to rush back to 
Lodz , disguised as non-Jews to our home because it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340

became very dangerous.  By September 1, when wa
r broke out, Hitler immediately ordered his 
troops, immediately overrun Lodz.  It took two days
 and here they were.  The Ar my I was so 
proud of, you know, the calvary with 
their white gloves and the beau
tiful pasture with the horses 
was disengaged and here we were under Hitler
.  And one law after the other followed in 
imme diate succession.  Schools were 
closed.  People were dismissed from their work.  We  could 
no longer wa lk on the streets.  We  had to walk 
on the sidewalk.  We  had to put yellow stars on 

both hands and then fi res broke out everywhere.  And I can still smell, almost smell the 

synagogue burning and the Germans rounding up the 
me n on the street, esp
ecially the ones with 
the beards and paftins, we had a lot of them 
in Lodz.  And they had to dance around and the 
Germans and the Poles were just looking at it with
 such joy and glee that
 it just  shattered my 
mi nd and made me  a very, very frightened pe
rson.  All that was going on.  I stayed under 
German Nazi rule in Poland until December of 1
939, and at that time , the whole feeling was let's 
escape, let's go where he isn't.  Poland was divided, 
at that time, in two parts.  One part of Poland 
the Russians took over and one part the Germans t
ook over, so the idea was to escape the part 
where the Ge rmans are and go to the part where 
Russia is.  So, one night we were sitting and 
people were just knock at the door, knock at th
e door, and me n were taken out, wome n were 
taken out.  It was just a f
earful, fearful situation. 
Q. What was going on in the streets?  I mean 
did you pretty muc h stay home and hide out? 
A. They couldn't  because they were rushed out of their homes by the Poles and Germans.  

They mi ght come  into a house and say all Jews out.  Then they would surround the me n and 

some  of them were never heard of.  There were
 me n going to work, with pails of water cleaning 
the streets, and we were very 
easily recognizable because you had 
to wear a Jewish star.  You 
could not go to a stor e and buy anything because it 
wasn't  being sold to Jews, so there was a little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
4 
 
bit of hunger already.  The predomin
ant fact was the fear.  Is my
 father going to go outside and 
ever come  back?   Am I a m going to go outside 
and ever come  back?   Are they going to surround 
our apartme nt.  It was the unknow
n of what they'r e going to do, but it was known that they were 
gong to do some thing. 

Q. Was there obvious brutality in the streets? 

A. Yes.  The Hitler ___________.  We  had a lot 
of Germans in Lodz, and the youngsters.  
"You there, you there, you there,
" you know back and forth with clubs, especially for the ma n it 
was worse than for the wome n.  They were just  
using sticks, throwing stones.  It was a free for 
all.  There was no one to protect the Jews.  We
 kind of became imme diately second class people, 
not even citizens or a pa rt of the community.  
By December we had a kindof family meeting and 
I just felt that I could not stay 
there.  On other hand, the feeling 
was well, that's  your home .  You 
have a roof over you.  You just don't walk out of th
e house, not in '39.  People did it later, but not 

in '39.  So, we ma de a decision th
at father and I are going to go on th
e other side to the Russians.  
We 'r e going to fi nd quart ers, se nd for my mother and my little sister, and we'll establish some 

kind of roots away from the Germans under the Ru
ssian occupation.  And that's  what we did.  
That was mi ddle of December '39.  So, my father
 and I didn't look what they call the term, I 
didn't look Jewish.  We  t ook the stars off and we set 
out to go to the Russians.  It wasn't  a unique 
idea.  Thousands of people had the same  idea, 
and proceeded to go like that.  Also, the Poles 
tried to go to the countryside rather than stay in
 the city, so you were facing moving sidewalks.  

People, people, people, moving with bags on th
eir backs.  Suitcases, horse and buggy, but it was 
just a moving stream of people, so we set out 
and our first direction was Warsaw.  Now, I don't 
know if you're aware of how Poland was divi
ded.  But towards ______________ that was part of 
Russia.  So, we went in that direction, so our 
first stop was Wa rsaw Ghetto.  We  did not have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
5 
 
Ghetto yet in Lodz so we were living in our
 own home s.  Wh en we 
got to Wa rsaw, found out 
that all Jews lived in a Ghetto.  We  sneaked in
to the Ghetto and it was 
a horror.  Dirty, hunger, 
they were so much worse off than we were, and 
there was no pl ace for us to stay or di d we have 
a desire to stay.  So, after being there two days
, we sneaked out of the Ghetto and continued our 
trip to the Russian side.  As we walked towa
rds, not knowing exactly 
where we were going, but 
general directions, and since we were not 
unique, and there were hundreds and hundreds of 
people, you start talking to people.
 We found ourselves close to a 
family and they say well they 
are going to the Russian part t
oo, and they have a ma id who lives not far from the Rus sian 
border.  They are going there and she is going to 
bring them over.  We  are free to join them.  
Well, that wa s a wonderful opportunity, since we
 didn't know where we were going, and so we 
joined the group of people.  Sure enough, we got 
to the house of the ma id which was not far from 
the border. 
Q. How long had you been walking? 
A. Oh, ma ybe two weeks.  Maybe a week, some thing like that. 
Q. In the wint er? 

A. Yes, well it was December.  We  get to the farm house and the ma id greets them and also 

us with warmth and they have it all ready.  They
 had a room ready for all of us and they were 
going to sneak in because it was still German occ upation.  They were sneaking in food for us in 

the evening, and then the first oppor
tunity they have that they f
eel the road is clear, they are 
going to bring us over.  I was observing the whol
e situation and it became  very uncomfortable 
for me .  I say, why does it take them so long.  Some thing isn't right.  And I was not wrong.  We  

were there about two days and then in the mi ddl
e of the night there is a knock.  The doors from 
the place where we stayed on that farm, rip open 
and here is a German patrol escorted by the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
6 
 
ma id and the rest of her fa mily.  We  were in 
just one room, c o mpletely surrounded and the first 
thing was your money, your this, your that.  So, 
father and I very quietly kind of went towards 
the door, and as they were so busy plundering th
e baggage, suitcases, we sneaked out, but I had 
nothing but the clothes I was 
wearing and so did father.  We  just blindly headed for the forest.  It 
was dark, it was cold.  We had no 
directions.  I turned around, th
ere is no father.  So, I found 
myself in that forest not know
ing quite where I am going but h
eading for the direction away 
from the farmhouse.  I must have run all night. 
 First I tried to find fa
ther, which was almost 
impossible.  Well, I never did, and when daylight
 started I found myself
 on the outskirts of a 
little town.  It was cold.  I wa
s hungry.  I was upset.  Putting it mildly, I was desperate, when a 
woma n approaches me  and she must have sensed 
that I was not from that part of town or 
country, whatever I was.  She approaches me  a
nd says why are you on the street at that hour?   
That's not allowed.  And I said, I was just atta
cked by the Poles and Germans and I was running.  
Where am I ?   She says, "Come with me ."  And s he took me  to her house.  She was a Jewish 
woman who went to fetch some water and took 
a chance to get some  water when the Germans 
and Poles aren't  out, that's why she was on the str
eet.  She took me  to her house, her home , if you 
can call it such.  It was a one room house, one 
room living quarters, and 
she had three little boys 
and a very pious Jews, sitting there praying and sh
e gave me a little bit 
of food.  Put me  right 
next to the stove and tried to find out from wher
e I am, what am I doing and so on, and I told her 
that that's what happened to me .  M y intent is to
 go over to the Russian part of Poland.  She says, 
well that's  very hard, but I'll see what I can do for you.  She evidently was -- I don't know what 

her position in that  little town
 was, whether she was a rabbi's wife, but knew the community.  

She went at night, she we nt over and she came b
ack and she says I'll give you a way to go over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
7 
 
to the Russians because I know people who do it a
ll the time .  They are smugglers.  That's the 
trade they have. 
Q. Were these Jewish smugglers? 

A. Yes.  I had nothing.  I had no papers, no 
money, nothing literally 
zilch.  She brought me  
over to the smugglers.  They looked me  over for 
some  reason they say okay, we'll take you with 
us.  So, I was very fortunate without the help 
of those strangers who stretched out their hand 
because they felt sorry for me  or I just looked di ffe
rent to whatever they were, I can't explain it.  

But they were so kind.  The smuggl ers took me  w
ith them.  What they did were they were 
smuggling shoes, but just to assure themselves 
that nobody is going to grab from the m what they 
grabbed from some one else, 
they first carried all left shoes, and then ma de the next trip with bags 
of right shoes and then the two 
bags got together and they hadhundreds of pairs of shoes.  But 
they worked with the Poles and Germans, so
 when they came around, the smugglers and I and 
the shoes went to a little ____________ where Germ
an patrol was standing and under their 
direction we went over to the Russian part. 

Q. Do you remember the name s of these towns? 

A. I don't reme mber the name .  At one point 
I did reme mber and I wrote it down.  It's  
____________ or some thing like that.  It's a verysmall kind of town, and that's how I find 

myself on the Russian front. 

Q. Now, being that there we re all these sm
ugglers and here you were an attractive 17, 18 
year old girl, was that an advantage or did they try --? 

A. No, I don't think they took any advantage of me
 being a pretty 17 girl at all.  As a ma tter 

of fact, nobody did, in all of my encounters.  I 
found kindness in a certain -- I don't know.  They 
kind of spoke to me  diffe rently like feeling sorry
 for me  and that's  very unusual because you feel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
8 
 
sorry for some one when there is one, two, thr
ee, but there were hundred
s of people like me .  
Maybe not all alone, but so I only had kindness from
 the m.  Then they had a place on the other 
side of the river where Poles were wa iting and th
ey collected their shoes,
 and then we parted 
company.  The Poles even offered me  to stay with them, and you know, you don't have to go any 
further, stay here.  But, I wasn't  trusting a
nyone.  I took advantage of their kindness but never 
trusted them.  So, then they went about their 
way and I continued.  Now, I was on the Russian 
site, but I still had no money.  I 
still didn't know where to go, and 
my recollection was that as we 
were still at home, my uncles 
took the route before us, and they were me ntioning the city of 
___________.  So, I said I have to get to 
_____________, and ma ybe some how, some  way, I 
had no address or no name s of peop
le, I contact them, find t hem.  
It 's not unusual to meet people 
on the street, because everybody was walking.  
It took me  two weeks to get to _____________.  

There was no transportation.  I had no money for  
tickets so when a train was moving, I tried to 
jump on top of the roof and get a little ride and 
then people we re always helping me .  When I did 
get to ________________, it was a terrible 
disappointme nt which I could not understand it there, 
but I understood it a little later.  Evidentl
y, _______________ was a central city, where all the 
people from the German part of Poland used to
 congregate.  So, the 
city was over run with 
______________ so called.  And they had no place for them.  They had no heart for them.  So, 

you couldn't get a glass of water if you did not pa
y for it.  So, I spent a few nights on a bench.  
Finally, somebody said there is 
some  people from Lodz congregating in that house and I run 
there and I couldn't stay there because again, fo
r a little place on the floor you had to pay money, 
and I had none.  So, there was a woma n who said 
oh, I'll tell you, I just come  here for business, 
but I live in a little town about 17 miles 
from ___________, and I am sure that you can go to 
school there because schools in Russia are free.  Th
at's what I wanted to do.  She said come with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
9 
 
me , I 'll take you there and you find out, ma ybe things will be easier for you.  Since I ha d nothing 
to lose, I said okay.  Not that I knew her before
, and the transportation 
I reme mber clearly my 
journey from ___________ to _____________.  It had to 
be done by sled.  There was no other 
way of transportation.  By then it was January, an
d it was very, very cold.  Sled rides, the people 
who were running the sleds, that's  how they ma de
 their living, but they
 offered to take me  
without money.  But, my  legs were all frozen. 
 I didn't have enough warm clothes and they were 
frozen for about seven, eight years until I got ri
d of it.  Anyway, I ge
t to that city of 
____________.  She took me  her home, and she says 
I'll introduce you to pe
ople who mi ght help 
you and at that time  that was the Russian part now. 

Q. Is she a Jewish wo ma n? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And at this point, you had lost
 all contact with
 your fa mily? 
A. Well, I had no contact with my mother and si
ster who were in the German part.  I had no 
contact with my father whom I lost
 in the woods so I was all alone. 
 So, when I got to that little 
town of _______________, she right away, 
a small town, they say, oh th
ere is a little girl who 
came from the German s i de.  So, there was quite 
a congregation of people from that little town 
around and then there was one person who said I 
introduce you to the Russian commissar who is 
in charge of all the stores and his wife is ta
king care of children who have no home s and ma ybe 

some how we can work some thing out that you ca
n go to school, ma ybe fi nd a job, and I had no 
place to go, I say okay I'll stay another day. 

Then the next morning, they brought me  into that
 Russian officer.  She spoke Russian.  I spoke 
Polish.  The people around me  spoke Jewish.  I di
d not speak Jewish, but 
I understood it.  So, he 
had a lengthy conversation with 
me  the interpreter and he says, you stay here don't you travel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
10 
 
any further.  I see what I can do for you. You co
me to my office tomorrow morning.  And I said, 
your office, I don't speak Russian.  I don't know r
eally nothing.  He said don't worry.  So, I 
stayed another night at the house
hold of that woman, and the next 
morning I got into his office 
and he said, okay, put me at his desk, wrote the 
Russian alphabet out for me  and says you learn 
Russian and in the meantime I 'll give you a salary. 
 So, it was just unbelievable luck.  To ma ke a 
long story short, I st ayed in the city of
 _______________ until the Germa n liquidated the Jews, 
but that's  getting ahead of it. 
Q. Why was he  so nice, and how did you know who to trust? 

A. Well, I trusted them as far as when I had 
no other choices.  When I had choices, I did not 
trust them.  Why did I trust him?   
I ha d no place to go, so why shouldn't I. 
Q. And he was just a nice ma n? 

A. He was just a nice ma n.  He introduced me  to
 his wife, to his children, and they were very 
helpful at their later day in that  respect that  
the Russians were sending out
 all the people who got 
into the city of _______________ after 
a certain day to Siberia.  
She put me  on her list of the 
children who had no parents and di dn't  belong any place and that's how I was saved from being 

taken to Si beria. 

Q. So, what did you do in this small town for all this time? 

A. After a very short time , I learned 
the language and I worked for Mr. ______________.  
That was the name  of the guy and became  the cashi
er of all the retail stor
es.  A very prominent 
job.  I got paid.  I could afford 
to rent a finished room.  I coul
d afford to buy my food, a nd I was 
quite comfortable.  The only thing is the Ge
rmans closed the borders between the Russian 
occupation part, and so I had no co
ntact with what happened with my mother.  I had no contact 
with what happened in Lodz.  I didn't  know what 
happened to the Jews.  Nothing.  We were just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
11 
 
completely shut off from any informa tion.  Af
ter all, the Germans a
nd the Russians were buddy, 
buddy at that time.  So, I was just all by myse
lf, and I was working and except not knowing and 
not having a way to know life kind of stabilized for me .  I couldn't go to school because that's 
true, school was free, but board and food and everythi
ng else was not.  So,  I 
stayed in that town 
until ______________ when Germany invaded the Russian
 part of Poland after they had that 
pact. And again, the Germans ma rched into 
_____________ in a very short time  it's true, Mr. 
___________ said, "Bella, we are skipping town.  We
 are going further to Russia.  Please do 
come with me.  Come with my 
fa mily."  And I said no.  I had 
the me mory, or so I thought, of 
what it meant to just  travel from city to city 
and not having a place.  I 
didn't think I could face it 
again.  So, I was not willing to give up the room
 that I had.  The Germans were not there yet.  
Memories are some ti me s short.  So, I opted not to go with him. 

Q. One question.  When this are was under Ru
ssian control and you were living there, were 
Jews allowed to be Jews openly?  
 Was there any problem with that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And they knew you were Jewish? 

A. Oh, yes.  That was never questioned.  The 
only thing, since it was so close to the actual 

Russian border, they di d not want refugees th
ere, that's why I was not sent out because 

____________ took me  under his wing, but a lot of peopl
e were sent out into deep Russia.  
Because that was not a ve ry good element for them, 
and they wanted to get rid of them.  So, I 
stayed.  But then on June 21, when the 
Germans invaded the Russian part -- 
Q. 1941? 

A. 1941.  So, I would say I had a year of fairly
 comfortable living.  I ma de fr iends.  I me t 
everybody.  Everybody was nice to me .  I had a salary. 
 I had a job.  It was lonely but I was free 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340

of the Germans.  Until that June 21, the Germans 
came very fast,  very swift.  The second day 
they were there, they surr
ounded all ma n of the 
little city.  It was a _____________ get a shovel, 
get some food for three days.  We have to build
 roads.  Almost everybody just signed up, so it 
became a city of women.  All men left and were 
ne ver heard of again.  As I was sitting in my 
room, there was a very kind lady who said, "Loo
k, the Germans are here.  You cannot stay by 
yourself.  You come  and live with me."  I knew her son.  I never me t her but I knew her son, and 
I knew her daughters and I said, "No,I
 cannot do it.  You have --."  She said, "I don't want to hear 
any different."  She was a very energetic pers
on.  She says, "Come on.  Ge t your possessions."  I 
didn't have much, so it wasn't  a problem of sorting 
what I take, what I leave.  I had very little, 
and she took me  to her household.  Her name
 was Mrs. Pollock.  She was just the most 
wonderful, wonderful person that I have ever me t in 
my life, and I me t lots of people, and lots of 

people who are helpful to me , but she was just 
wonderful.  She had lots of contacts through the 
far mers.  She used to put her babushka on and ge
t into the farm and bring some  bread and share 
it with me , like she shared it with her daughters.
  There was never a difference.  She was just 
great. 

Q. These were Jewish people? 

A. Yes.  As I was working, I ma de contacts wi
th non-Jewish people too, and they were very 
nice, very helpful, very friendly.  Most of th
e people were always very friendly towards me . 

Q. When you refer to this as a city of wome
n, you'r e  talking about just the Jewish area? 
A. Well, we weren't in the Ghetto yet. 

Q. But the me n who were taken away were just Jewish me n?  

A. Just Jewish me n.  Well, I don't reme mber exac
tly the period of times we could stay in our 
home s, then it come s that all Jews go to
 a Ghetto in _______________.  There was no question 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
13 
 
for her that I go wherever she goes.  So, we ha
d about a week's time I think to find quarters.  
They just gave us a few houses separated them an
d then all the Jews from spread out towns had 
to go to a Ghetto.  That was my firs
t experience and exposure to a Ghetto. 
Q. About how ma ny peopl e were in this Ghetto? 
A. I would just have to take a rough -- ma ybe
 8,000.  I wouldn't want to be quoted on it 
because I don't know, but it was a 
small town to be gin with, and the Jewish population wasn't  
that tremendous.  There was not an outright  an
ti-semitism felt because it was spread out.  So, I 
really don't know, but I do know that she found quarter
s.  Every family had to find where to live, 
so she found a house where there were two sister
s living and they had two rooms and a kitchen 
and then she had a mother, Mrs. Pollock.  So, it 
was her mot her, myself, her two daughters, and 
she, we all moved into that two room apartment.
  Life in Ghetto wasn't  terrible because the 
people who were in charge of the Ghetto ha
d a certain kindness about
 them and a certain 
understanding.  So, those are Jews in the Ghetto 
and then there are Germans outside.  They have 
to abide or ders in or der for the Germans not to 
storm the Ghetto. But their idea was how to help 

the Jewish population who was there.  So, yes, 
we did have police and we
 did have a Judenrot, 
but they were a part of the Jewish community of 
the Ghetto, which was not true in other Ghettos.  
We were supplied our food from Wilno, the Wil
no Ghetto was our ma in headquarters, you could 
say.  We  stayed in the Ghetto and I found a job for a German commandant of ______________ 

as a cleaning woma n or cleaning girl, but she did 
have a German who took care of his needs.  I 

was just a helper of the German sol dier, and 
he too was very kind.  I 
never felt any abuse or 
anything like that. 

Q. You went outside of the Ghetto every day? 

A. Yes, I went outside of the Ghe
tto to work.  Lots of people did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
14 
 
Q. Was this a sealed off Ghetto? 
A. It wasn't  closed.  It was sealed off but 
people were going to work and comi ng back fr om 
work so there was contact.  Of course there was a 
lot of barter, and it wasn't  a very strict kind of 
situation.  There was also hunger already creeping
 in.  We  ha d to give all our possession, the 

gold, furs, whatever the Germans collected th
at.  Some how, I found a m
azing through my whole 
experience, they dema nded that they give all your 
jewels away, and it was hard to part with it so 
you gave it away.  You wouldn't think of flushing 
it down the toilet or an
ything like that, but it 
was yours and you couldn't do it.  At that point,we knew that the Wilno Ghetto had a lot of 

actions, that  a lot of people were
 being killed and take
n away and the Judenrot had to submit the 

people.  The Germans ne ver entered the Ghetto.  Th
ey just gave the Judenrot a list, today I need 
100,000 people or 10,000 people, whatever the transf
er was.  And one day, I reme mb er clearly, 
the Wilno Judenrot put a request 
towards ____________, that the Jews of _________________ 
have to supply 1,500 people, and the Judenrot
 of ___________ said no.  We 
are not doing it.  So, 
after two days, the contingency from W
ilno Ghetto came to ____________ and said, look, we 
just struck a bargain with the Germans.  In
stead of 1,500 people you give us 400 people elderly 
people, whatever.  You give us a list.
  We  want to grab them an then
 we continue our life as it is.  
Well, they did get 400 older people under the pret
ext that they'r e going to be relocated and not 
far from ____________ they put them all in not a barr
ack, but a farm house -- a barn and just set 
fire to it, and all the 400 people were burned.  No
w, those were people that we all knew, but that 
was the only time that they got any people from ______________. 

Q. How did you get information about 
what was going on in Wilno and _______________? 
A. Well, people were kind of sneaking out, comi ng back, going, and so it wasn't  a very 

precise  information, but things started to filter th
rough.  Most of the stories were not believed.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
15 
 
So, we did get kind of a feeling what was going on 
in Wilno.  Not precisely but one day we got a 
decree that _____________ Ghetto is being liquida
ted.  It's time  for ______________ to become  
_____________. 

Q. About when was this? 

A. '42 probably because '43 I was in _______________.   

Q. Was it liquidated in April '43, does that ma ke sense? 

A. When I got to _______________, I thought ma ybe April '43 yes because I was in Wilno a 

short time. 

Q. But you're saying in the ____________ Ghetto, y
ou really didn't  have actions and all 

sorts of reprisals against the people and roundups? 

A. No, because the Judenrot  -- 
the only roundup was the 400 people. 
Q. So, you felt moderately safe there? 

A. Yes.  Kind of life took it's own tone so to say. 
Q. Were there any activitie
s in the Ghetto?   We re th
ere schools for the children? 
A. No, it was a small community.  If I said
 8,000 maybe I exaggerated the amount because 
there was a lot of people comi ng in fr om the neig
hboring little farms.  They were all put into 
_______________, but I made some friends. 
 So, people were going out to
 work, comi ng.  It was 
not-- you didn't feel the Germans ' ha nd very stro
ngly, and people were helping eachother alot.  
They were just such unusual kind of people that 
it's  unbelievable to describe.  But I have such 
warm feeling towards every one there.  They a
ll embraced me.  I embraced them.  We used to 
after work, get into somebody's room and talk and it wasn't  any special activity.  There were 
small grounds, but kind of life progressed day by day. 
 Mrs. Pollock used to go out on the farm at 
night, come  back bring some  flour, get some  bread. 
 Never did she make me feel that I am taking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
16 
 
food away fr om her children.  Not for one second. 
 There were times, before I got my job, that 
they were saying we need 100 girls to build road
s, she would send her daughters instead of me .  
She felt I'm too delicate for it.  I mean she was just so terrific. 
Q. And the Jewish police who are guarding 
the Ghetto, would let people come  and go? 
A. Well you had to have permission.  It wasn't  
just free-- because we were not allowed to 
walk the st reets. 

Q. Not even in the Ghetto? 

A. In the Ghetto, yes.  

Q. But you said this woma n would go out at night
 to the farms.  Did 
she sneak out or the 
people just didn't look? 

A. She sneaked out. 

Q. And if the policeman saw her, they turned the other way? 

A. She ma de sure nobody sees her. 
Q. When you were working for this German in
 town, did you learn a
nything special that you 
mi ght not have learned otherwise? 

A. No, just the Jewish star. 

Q. You didn't hear them talking about anything? 

A. No.  I was treated decent, but I was not a part
 of -- I very rarely 
had any contact with the 
commandant I was working for.  That was not my 
place.  I wasn't  a me mber of that fa mily.  I 
was just doing the work, and it did give me  an op
portunity if I was to go and bring water which 
was in the next house, we  didn't have running water, and then they were friends of mi ne, the 

Poles, and I used to sneak into 
their house, and they used to gi
ve me  a slice of bread which I 
could bring back to the Ghetto.  So, there wa
s still some  contact with the outside world. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
17 
 
Q. Now, you said you were learning little by li
ttle what was happening in Wilno.  Did you 
have any knowledge of what was 
happening in the camps in Poland? 
A. No, not at that time .  So, when th
ey liquidated the ______________ Ghetto, what they 
did is they took the Jews from the _________________ Ghetto and send them to a different so 
called camp.  I don't remember the name of it.  It 
was not a barn, a big house.  It was clean, clean 
barracks, but I found so confining, no freedom 
to move, no way to escape.  Nothing, so I 
discussed it with Mrs. Pollock and said, "Look, I can
't  stay here.  I feel choked.  I am going to go 

to the Wilno Ghetto."  And the people who were 
going to the Wilno Ghetto to bring products for 
that camp, __________ was the name of the camp. 

Q. This is before the Ghetto was liquidated or right after? 

A. No, no.  Right after the Ghetto was 
liquidated we were sent to ______________, and I 
stayed there about three days. 
 There was no distribution of work or nothing, but it was like 
living in a big open place and no wh
ere to escape.  I was always 
fearful of putting my whole life 
in one kind of place.  Even before the Gh
etto _______________was liqui dated, I worked with a 
gentleme n during the Russians, a Pole, an elderly 
ma n.  And when he heard that the Ghetto is 
going to be liquidated ________________ he came to the 
gates when I was going to work and he 
said, "Bella, please come with me .  I settle you.  My cousin's far m far away from here.  Nobody 

would know.  I'll just introduce you as my niece."  
You see, I spoke perfect Polish.  It was very 

hard to detect that I am Jewish.  And I was th
inking back and forth, and back and forth, and then 

in the last mo me nt, before we were sent out, I 
said no.  Again, I would not put myself fully under 
any fa mily's  control.  So, I just went w
ith Mrs. Pollock to ________________ and then I ma de 
contact with the guys who were going for pr
ovision to Wilno and I said, "Hey, buddy, would you 
take me  to Wilno? "  And they said okay, but you
'll have to be very quiet.  We 'll put you on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
18 
 
bottom of the truck.  We 'll put straw over you and then we'll sneak you into Wilno.  So, the next 
morning, early in the mo rning, I went on the truck, 
and I went to Wilno.  As luck would have it, 
at that particular time, the German officers were
 at the gates of the Wilno Ghetto, and they poked 
the truck and here I come out.  So, the Wilno pol
ice, who had no idea, kind of whisked me  away 
from the m and brought me  into the Ghetto and put 
me  into that jail.  Some how I got away from 
the Germans thanks to their alertn
ess or whatever.  So, I was in th
e jail for about a day and a half, 
and I was interrogated.  Why a m I comi ng here.  
What do I want here, and so on and on and what 
am I going to be, and what am I going to live on. 
 There was  Jewish police woma n and she was 
from Kovno.  She said, "Oh, let her go.  I'll take
 her to my house."  So, again, luck was just 
unbelievably with me .  She did take me  to her 
quarters and kind of took me  under her wing.  She 
was a sweet young lady.  She had a mother and two si
sters and a little brothe
r and I certainly was 
not welcome in their house, because I took anot he r little space away.

Tape 2 
 
Q: I'm going to back track a little a
nd ask if you had any knowledge of the ____________ 
group who were operating in that area? 
A. Yes, I do, I did.  At that time, because hi
stor y was repeating itse
lf, the same  kind of 
Germans I saw in Lodz.  The same  kind of groups were entering the city of _______________, 

surrounding houses.  Everybody out, me
n out.  They were wearing those black uniforms, and 

they were a petrifying force.  You know that if 
they leave and you're stil
l alive, just count your 
blessing.  It's your happy hour.  There was ne
ver any assuredness that once you are surrounded 
them that you will escape from their clutches.  It
 was never your choice. 
 They either had enough 
people, or got what they wanted and left, but you 
really had no control ov
er it.  If they were 
looking for me n or they suspected some body was hi
ding, they didn't hesitate
 to enter the homes 
and bang around and look around and you're just stan
ding there like a little mouse, or a big 
mouse, whatever. 
Q. Were these organized groups
 or just bands of thugs. 
 We re they all Germans? 
A. Well, no.  They were pretty organized, verydisciplined, very impre
ssive and their posture 
and their self assurance.  I mean they were the 
Lord and Masters.  What they were before, we 
had no knowledge.  We  just found out what kind of 
people were there, but they were the heros of 
the world.  They had the power over that bundl
e of nothing, because the Jews became nothing.  
See, we stopped being  huma n beings. 
 So, yes, we were aware of them. 
Q. How did you know these were the 
______________group, and did they have local 
auxiliaries? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
20 
 
A. Well, the soldiers were not in the city.  
Soldiers we re fighting the front.  Those were 
special groups with one purpose, round up the Je
ws.  They were wearing different kinds of 
uniforms.  There was one group which was w
earing the brown uniforms.  That was a 
__________, they were working on construction of roads.  When they used to come  in, and ask 
for people, you were pretty much assured that you are just going to go for a day, work on the 

roads and come  back.  When the _________ group 
came, you didn't think you would ever come  
back. 

Q. Did they have local support? 

A. Not in _______________.  They had it everywhere else starting from Lodz to whatever, 

they had full local support. 

Q. How did you learn what happened to 
these people who were taken away? 
A. Well, fi rst of all, many a times they used
 to take another group of people from the 
Ghettos.  That became more clear in Wilno than
 in any place else because that's where the ma ss 
destruction took place.  In ____________ it was ju
st a gr oup of me n, you know.  But some body 
had to dig the graves and some body had to cove
r the graves, and the Germans weren't going to 
do it.  So, people were called to go to work and 
sometimes sneaked back they were telling tales 
and to us they were just tales, because no th
at couldn't happen, wouldn't happen, didn't  happen.  
It took quite a few years until the 
real idea penetrated to everybody that that's what the Germans 
do.  That they were such ma sters in psychology because some times when they round up people 
for work, the people really went to work.  So
me times when they round up people for work, the 
people were going to killing grounds.  You never 
knew what's  what.  So, they kind of dulled 
your senses and there was always the hope, so you'd 
just go like cattle to the grave.  That was 
that ma ssive in Wilno-- in _____________ that it became very pronounced in Wilno. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
21 
 
Q. In _______________ were you aware of any efforts 
to the people to get away to for m a 
resistance group, anything like that? 
A. No, not really in ____________.  Resistance towa rd
s what?   Get away wh
ere?   It was not 
that time to escape so where do you go?   Who is 
going to help you?   There was no place to go. 
Q. In all the time  that you were there, you've 
now been away from your fa mily a few years, 
what went through your mi nd? 

A. Through my  mi nd that my fa mily is probably 
no longer is alive.  That's  the more I was 
exposed to the politics and the behavior of the 
Germans towards the Jews, the more I knew that 
the chances for any of us to survive are not trem
endous.  So, I really didn't think that my fa mily 
is alive, and I really did not c
hoose to have a picture of how they
 died because it wasn't very 
clear in my mi nd either, how.  Did they come  
and round them up in Lodz like they did, the 
people when I witnessed it.  Did they take anot
her turn.  I had no idea. I didn't know much about 
the Lodz Ghetto, either.  I knew about the Wa rsaw 
Ghetto.  I was there, but not the Lodz Ghetto.  
Interesting that after the war, and I'm ahead of 
my story, I found out that almost each Ghetto was 
operated on a different wave leng
th.  There were different me
thods with different people, 
different way of admi nistration, it
 was just not known 
to me  then.  I knew how the Wilno Ghetto 
operated because I was there.  I knew how 
the ___________ operated because I was there, but I 
didn't have a scale of comparison at
 that time.  So, lots of the th
ings especially of other Jewish 
communities and how they handled their killing 
grounds and their being alive, I found out later 
but not then.  I still am talking 
about Ghettos, which is quite di
fferent than concentration camps. 
Q. This is probably a strange question, but 
by thinking that your family was probably not 
alive any more, did that free you 
at all from having to worry about then and think about them? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
22 
 
A. No, it did not free me  from thinking about th
em, but it freed me for independent action.  I 
can move around.  I can hide in the doorway or 
not hide int he doorway.  I don't have to worry 
well if I hide and my little sist er  and mother are in the room upstairs, I have a certain 
responsibility,  So, yes, I was free.  There were
 a lot of people who had fa mily.  I was more 

lonely, I was more not belonging, but I was freer
.  And I used that freedom later on in ma ny 
occasions.  Yes, and I pr obably used it in ___________________ Ghetto.  Would I be with my 

family, Mrs. Pollock wouldn't take care of me
.  She wouldn't find a place for me .  Maybe my 
fa mily would, but we were not natives of that part
icular place, so I can't  
weight it, but if you can 
put it in those terms, there we
re certain advantages of being alone if you found helping hands 
from other people.  I was not just an island by 
my self.  I could have never done it without their 
help of strangers, who really didn't want any reward. 

Q. So, you went into the Wilno Ghetto? 

A. I went into the Wilno Ghetto, and that young 
lady befriended me .  What I didn't do in the 
Wilno Ghetto, which was required, I did not register
.  So, I wasn't  on any lists, but by now some  

people who are _____________ before and they were liv
ing there so I was kind of a free agent, 
but I did not register.  So, when the 
actions came, I was not on the list. 

Q. And you knew this?   This was intentional? 

A. Yes.  And I knew at that point enough pe
ople who would say there's going to be an 
action.  I knew a lot of policemen because young
 me n or wome n were policemen and some  of 
them were more devoted to the cause very impor
tant were their jobs, 
and other ones just let 
functionaries because it's necessary.  So,I reme mb
er at least three or four actions where people 

were lined up and I was warned they'r e going to
 round them up.  Twice I stayed in the city 
because I had a job outside the cit
y.  I stayed not on my job.  I couldn't do that, but I knew there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
23 
 
was an empt y apartment in the building where I 
was working.  So, instead of gig back to the 
Ghetto, I just crawled under a be
d in that apartment.  The next
 day I just crawled out and was 
back on the job.  I couldn't  do it if I would have 
obligations towards my fa
mily.  Would I rather 
not have a fa mily and have that freedom?   No, but
 that wasn't  my choice.  At other time s there 
was actions in the Wilno Ghetto, and they were
 very often.  Anyway, it worked.  The Germans 
gave the commandant, ___________ was the commandant 
of the Wilno Ghetto, gave him a list 
that ma ny thousand people he needs today, next 
week, next month, whatever the case.  I was 
hidden in a policemen's room when he was on dut
y, I wouldn't  say room -- cubical, but I had to 
be a quiet as could be because that place, the 
ot her Jewish police would not come  because it was 
the policemen quarter.  So, I mi ght
 lie under the bed for two days.  Again, I was lucky, fortunate 
at one of the actions, especially the last liqui da
tion when the police had no control I watched the 
Germans when they finished with one buildi
ng, I kind of got into th
e building where they 
finished getting everybody out.  So, no, it wasn't  
a calculated kind of action, it was spontaneous, 
whatever the situation was, and I was getti
ng away with it.  Lots of people did not. 
Q. You were doing this on your own? 
A. Well, I had nobody else.  We ll, when I sa
y on my  own, yes, but there was always 
some one helping a little bit.  Like if I knew 
some one who knew there wa
s going to be an action 
that particular day.  I di
d what I did on my own. 
Q. You didn't hide with other people? 

A. No. 

Q. Were there actions all the time?  I mean 
was it a pr etty fearful place to live in Wilno? 

A. Very.  Very, very fearful, very insecure, 
and I really didn't belong any place so I didn't 
have a permanent place so to say.  Ye s, so it wa
s very fearful and I had no money.  I didn't know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
24 
 
influential people, and that always helps.  
There was a lot of it going on.  I imagine you could 
buy out your place on an action.  I was a newcomer 
to Wilno and again, the same policy, let's get 
rid of the Jews who ca me late
r here, who ca me from the surro
unding areas.  So, yes, it was a 
very fearful place to live.  There was al
so a group of people from ______________ in Wilno 
who were very involved in the resistance of th
e Germans.  And, I guess it was a fairly large 
group, but the ma jority of the inhabitants of the Gh
etto did not want to rock the boat as long as 
some body else goes out of the Ghetto, let's not ge
t the Germans in because then we are all going 
to be destroyed.  We ll, they had different views of
 it, and it was even argued then.  Is it right for 
___________ to get his police to round up that ma ny Je
ws because the Germans wanted and they 
assured you the choice of who was going to go w
ill be yours and not the Germans at random, or 
should we just the hell with that
, fight it out.  The ma jority of
 the population of the Ghetto did 
not want an uprising. 

Q. They supported __________? 
A. Yes.  And they opposed the groups who wa
nted to arm the ms e lves and they really 
opposed it because that was a fear.  The Germans 
find out, they enter the Ghetto, and we'll all 
going to be destroyed.  So, I am 
not  passing judgme nt.  I'm j ust 
telling you what the mood was. 
Q. Were you involved in any resistance? 
A. I personally was not involved in any resist
ance.  I was involved in nothing.  I was just 

trying to survive without harming anyone
, but I knew a lot of people who did. 
Q. The people that you knew who were involved in 
resistance activities, 
what sorts of things 
were they doing? 

A. First of all, they were trying to get out of 
the city and bring ammunition in to the Ghetto.  
When the Ghetto was in the process -- very shor
tly before the whole Ghetto was liquidated, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
25 
 
-- I don't know if I'm going ahead
 or not-- but anyway, that gr
oup set against -- you compile your 
lists if you believe that that mi ght save any Jews 
but don't touch us.  And they all collected in one 
building with all their ammunition 
and it was a known secret to ev
eryone that that place belongs 
to that so-called underground.  It no longer was u
nderground, but that's where they sat and they 
set the guns if the Germa ns ever come  into that bu
ilding and touch that hous
e, we let loose.  The 
Germans respected it.  They didn't touch it.  Well,
 eventually they did.  They had all the time in 
the world, you know. 
Q. Was this a fairly large gr oup? 

A. I wouldn't think so.  Not enough to do more damage to the Germans.  I have to die, if you 

Germans would die, but there was a much larger 
group that did not want to resist the Germans 
knowing how hopeless it would be.  And I believe
 against this, and pr
obably other commandants 
too, that as long as he can keep the Ge rmans out 
of the Ghetto there is a chance of saving one, 
two, five, twenty Jews.  But _____________ was ma rri
ed to a non-Jewish person, and really 
could have st ayed there. He eventually was killed
, but two or three or days before the Ghetto was 
liquidated they called him to headquarters and eviden
tly said they'r e comi ng into the Ghetto if he 
doesn't  supply whatever, and he said enough is enough, 
so they just got rid of hi m.  Then they 
stormed the Ghetto. 

Q. Daily life  in the Ghetto? 

A. That depends on the times.  When the acti
ons were going to take 
place or were taking 
place or  shor tly after they took place, there wa
s a very depressing mood, very frightened, very 
scared.  Then, as I say the Germans were wonderf
ul in allowing your feelings.  Life was kind of 
norma l for a Ghetto life.  You used to go to work.  You used to come  home .  If you were a young 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
26 
 
group of people, there wa s a cafe on the corner a
nd the young people used to gather together and 
sing some  songs, until the next
 episode would take place. 
Q. Were there cultural activities? 

A. Not organized cultural activities, not that I 
was aware of, and I certainly have no claim of 
knowing everything that was going on in the Ghe
tto. I was I imagine a pretty narrow mi nded 
person myself, but from what I knew it was rather 
spirit building.  We 'r e stil
l alive, we cannot sit 
still and think, not the yo
unger people.  And if I reme mber correc
tly, there was in that little cafe 
was a I reme mber the number was 31, the name  of 
the street probably will come  back to me , and 
it kind of lifted your spirit up, because none of us r
eally believed that we are going to survive it.  
So, there were love affairs 
going on.  Whatever normal does in normal circumstances under 
abnormal circumstances.  The ethical standards were
 not the same .  There was no code of ethics.  
There was none of that. 

Q. Why do you say that?   What does that mean? 
A. It means that things you would do when 
you were brought up in nice homes before the 
war, there were things you wouldn't 
do.  You wouldn't ma ke love so easily. 
Q. Whatelse? 

A. I don't know.  Just the whole outlook of did 
you hear that was taken 
on an action, this one 
-- it wasn't  as bad as it became later.  So, there 
was still ki nd of a measure,
 can I help you, or this 
one instead of that one justifying witnessing cert
ain actions.  That was not norma l behavior.  So, 
you tried to keep some  feel of sanity knowing that
 it's not the same  as outside.  I me an you don't 
buy your life for money.  I mean you don't do that 
outside.  You mi ght very easily do that in 

Ghetto if you can help it. 

Q. Did you steal from other 
people, tell on your neighbors? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
27 
 
A. Some times you would do that, yes.  It be
came  much more pronounced later on.  Ghetto 
still had some  semblance, and I use that word very cautiously, of fa mily life.  So, yes, there was a 
police over you.  There were some  zealous policemen
 if you were not supposed to have  onions in 
your house and they found a piece of onion on th
e floor or a crumb, yes, you would be 
denounced.  You would be punished.  Is that nor
ma l behavior, you know?   So, other ones tried to 
say-- but there was still some  fa mily life.  I 
didn't have one. I belonged no place, but lots of 
people did. 

Q. You had a social life? 

A. What social life.  I was ju
st floating around.  I had no roots. 
 I had no responsibilities, and 
I did not get involved in any underground, so I 
went to work and said well, what do I do 
tomorrow.  How do I escape the next day or how do I survive the next day.  So, it was a very 

selfish kind of existence. 

Q. What about institutions in the Ghetto, lik
e hospitals or soup kitc
hens, did that kind of 
thing exist? 

A. Not in the Wilno Ghetto.  Not to my knowledge. 

Q. It didn't have the organization that
 some  of these other Ghettos has? 
A. I don't think.  I am not aware of it, and I th
ink I would have been aw
are of it.  Who would 
support that soup kitchen?   There were 
no supplies comi ng in. There was no funds. 
Q. What about hunger, disease, things like that? 

A. Yes, hunger was becomi ng more and more 
pronounced because as I said it was semi -
norma l.  A lot of products were brought into th
e Ghetto by the people who did not live in the 
Ghetto before and there was a lot of bunkers and 
people were hiding things.  But then there were 
people who just got the normal  ra
tions and they were not very 
big.  So, yes, hunger was there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
28 
 
Q. Were people sick? 
A. People were sick.  People were hungry.  
People were unhappy, their heads were alwa ys 
down.  It was just how do I survive.  How do I 
survive every day living 
and how do I survive the 
outside world. 

Q. I'm trying to picture this.  If I were looki
ng at the streets of the 
Wilno Ghetto, not during 
an action, but just on a day, what would I see? 

A. You would see people milling around and m
oving around.  Just lots of people small 
quarters.  Wilno Ghetto was not
 tremendous and not necessarily 
dressed up, and not necessarily 
friendly and not necessarily -- just different 
needs and when you would go on the Wilno streets 
outside the Ghetto, those were 
lovely streets, love ly people.
  And you occasionally mi ght see 
Jews because when the Jews were going to work, 
they were going through the streets of Wilno, 
but not on the sidewalks.  They all wore stars. 
 They all were being led by some one.  So, you did 
see it, so whoever tells you we didn't know just is lying.  You could not not know.  So, that's just 
a cop out and the ma jority of the population believes 
this statement.  I just
 read an interesting -- 
it's not my own quotation, but some body wrote it in
 a book.  That when you hear today or heard 
after the war how helpful the outside populati
on was, how many thousand helpful people there 
were, it is very surpri sing that even one single Jew was killed. 
Q. Was there much observation 
of religion in the Ghetto? 
A. Individually, yes.  People became a little bi
t more religious looking for help.  There was 
no help from the outside world, so th
ey were looking for help from God. 

Q. Was this done in families or were there actually prayer houses? 

A. No, fa milies, as fa r as I know. 

Q. What kind of work did you do when 
you were living in 
the Wilno Ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
29 
 
A. When I was in the Ghetto I was working 
in a household, cleaning. 
 That was usually a 
very good job.  It was not on the street, it wasn
't  in a factory, so those were plum jobs. 
Q. How did you get it? 
A. I knew some one who needed ten people because he  was in command of and he said, 

"Hey Bella, I'll put you on that."  I said great. 

Q. So you were working for a Lithuanian fa mily, a German fa mily? 

A. I'm trying to reme mber because I didn't  wo
rk very much because I had no connections so 
occasionally I used to get a job.  It was a German fa mily. 
Q. How long were you in the Wilno Ghetto? 
A. A few months.  Not very long, but I was one 
of the last ones to leave the Wilno Ghetto. 
Q. How did the end come  a bout, can you tell me ?  

A. The end came  about when ______ refused the last remnants of the Jews. 

Q. How ma ny people are we talk
ing about that were still in
 the Ghetto approximately? 
A. I would say approxima tely 2,000.  Then the Germans ca me  i nto the Ghetto and they 

started rounding up Jews at random.  At that poin
t, I tried to avoid them, found myself in some  
bunker.  People were building precautionary places
.  I found myself in a bunker.  I stayed there 
overnight  until the next  morning when the actions
 were going on upstairs, I was downstairs, and 
the next day everybody was chased out.  We  were
 brought to a big ma rket, and we found there 
people who were chased out the da
y before right there assembled.  
So, we were the last remnants 
of the Ghetto.  I saw the trains ready ma
rked for Auschwitz, cattle cars ready.  
Q. How did you know Aus c hwitz? 

A. Well, at that point, we'r e talking ab
out 1943.  We knew about Auschwitz.  We  knew 
about Pornaty.  I don't know whether you know what Pornaty was.  Before the ovens we re 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
30 
 
working, and before it wa s beautiful organized m
echanized, they used to get people from the 
Ghetto.  They had a transport bring them to theforest of Pornaty.  Those dug their own graves 
and then they had to line up and were killed ther
e.  All of a sudden the Germans found an enemy.  
Not from the dead or the living, 
but the whole grounds lifted up.  Th
ey could not absorb all that 
blood and whatever, so those thing had to be dug
 out.  Those were the Jews from the Ghetto 
were brought in, dug out the graves and put some  
petroleum a nd burned it.  We  were fully aware 
of what Pornaty was. 

Q. As people came  back? 

A. Some  of them snuck out.  Some  of t hem 
were killed, st ayed there in the gr ave for two 

days until they dug themselves out until they got 
back home, the Ghetto.  So, at that point we 

were fully aware that  there is only one way for th
e Jews, that's  gas chambers.  And that was after 
the _________ conference, after 
the solution of how to take care of
 the Jews.  So, there really is 
not much hope.  There certainly wouldn't be
 muc h hope that anybody is going to help you. 
Q. You got information about this? 

A. Right.  That was at that point and when 
the first people came from Pornaty and told us 
what happened, there was total disbelief.  No hu
man being can do that to another human being.  
No huma n being is going to allow 
them to do that.  So, illusions.  So when the Wilno Ghetto was 
liquidated, that must have been September '
43 I think, those people were all -- it was wa rm, 
hungry, thirsty, frightened, Germans were all ar
ound with their dogs, and then they ma rched 
through the gates started.  Ca me  
my turn, there we re two SS me n pointing left, right, which is 

standard procedure as we'r e going.  I happened to 
be pointed to go right.  Just the same , there 

was a small group of very young girls, the ma jority
 was going left and was put on the trains and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
31 
 
off they went and new trains came and off they we
nt, and we just stayed there.  Then we were 
put on a truck and that wa s my last
 view of the population of Wilno.  
Q. How ma ny people werewith you? 
A. 200 out of 2,000, 4,000.  Why me ?   I don't know. 
 We  didn't know where we were going, 

but you were just going.  Whatev
er he said, left or right, th
at's  where you went.  You were 
brought in on that truck and then after a while 
we were loaded into a cattle car and the doors 
closed and we were just taking off.  We ha
d no idea where we were going.  The doors never 

opened.  We  weren't fed.  The situation in the cars was horribl e.  People became just wild.  No 

air, no food, little human dignity left.  You know, tw
o or three days -- once they stopped the cars 

and brought some  buckets of water in, and that 
probably was a bigger disa
ster than not having 
water.  I don't  know, bec a use the worst elemen
t of your personality was comi ng throughout.  
After about three days, I woul
d guess, of that voyage, the 
doors opened up and everybody 
_____,________,________, so you  just jump out of the cars and I was faced, and the rest of the 
people with me  was faced with a group of Ger m
a n soldiers with bayonets and some  kind of a 
forest.  Now, my thought was knowing what happened 
in Pornaty, that that's  the end of it.  Now, 
they'r e just going to get rid of us.  They didn't.
  After everybody was out, we all of a sudden see 
some  people in striped uniforms, and they speak Jewish and they say don't worry you're 
____________.  They brought us that group of people, 
which they brought on the train, the cattle 
car, they brought us to a barn with straw then
 all of a sudden this cr
eature come s through the 
barn, starched white blouse, red kerchief, black pa
nts with a whip in her hand and here we are a 
bundle of nothing.  I mean, just unbelievable impression.  We ll, we did get to _________ to the 

concentration camp of Heidelberg, unknown to me  at
 that time, but made known to me later that 
as we were on the Wilno grounds, the commanda
nt of the _______ concentration camp called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
32 
 
the commandant and said, "Hey, I killed all my wome n in ___________ and now I have 200 
hands to work.  Do you still have some  available?
"  And he did, and I was one of them, so I got 
myself to ____________ instead of Auschwitz. 

Q. So you arrived in _____________? 

A. Right.  And that whole group, they we re 
only wome n, no me n.  The next day they wrote 

our numbers and that was the point  where I st
opped being a person and became a number.  The 
whole set up life changed.  There were no more fam
ily units.  It was just a group of inhabitants, 
or a group of Jews, eventually for slaughter.  We  
stayed in that barn for about two days, until we 
were named, and in the meanti me a group of people 
were selected for work, and the type of work 
that all suitcases was closing had 
to be sorted and put away.  I wa
s chosen for that job too, so it 
was a group of I don't know, twenty girls, some
thing.  Then, the next morning, the ones who 
were there the day before were selected for the 
same  job.  And that even
tually became  my job. 
Q. Was there any particular way you got chosen for that? 
A. I would say it would be random.  In th
e meanti me, once we all got numbers, and I 
reme mber mine like today, it was 5633.  We  were
 put into barracks.  Everybody was assigned a 
place, and out clot hes were taken away.  We got striped clot hes and we became full fl edged 
inma tes of a concentration camp.  There were ot
her people in that camp, people that got there 
before us.  They were not _________ wome n because they we re killed off.  There was some  

German women and there was some  German me n.  
Then the selection of work started.  Again, 
you had an entirely different hierarchy.  No l
onger did you have a Judenrot.  The people in 
charge of us were Germans -- not Germans, soldie
rs, but prisoners of war,
 criminals, people who 
were sent to concentration camps for crimes committed, and all of a sudden they became the elite 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
33 
 
of the --snapping their fingers.  They could do wh
atever they pleased.  Power thirsty and just 
brutes, real honest 
to goodness brutes. 
Q. In what way? 
A. Abusive, beating, snap command be cause 
they were dealing with vermin, not huma n 
beings anymore.  They were just outright crimin
als.  The guy that was in charge of the camp, Mr. 
Ickes, was there for killing his wife and her boyfri
end.  There were other ones.  Some  of them 
were political prisoners.  They were nicer.  The 
di fference with them was they were all wearing 
little triangles, the bl ack triangl
es designated one crime.  Then we had the commandant who was 
a German SS.  We  had some  Ger man SS supe
rvising some  internal functions of _____________.  

And then we had some  J e wish supervisors su
pervised by German guards who were working 
outside the camp. ______________ really was not a 
camp, it was a collection camp.  They used 
to bring Jews from Ger many.  It was an 
interesting place when you learned later about 
geography and happenings.  ______________ was a very 
important place. The Germans did not 
do their killing on German grounds.  They exported 
the Jews and the mi nute they left the borders 
of Ger many, they no longer were German 
citizens and they just
 joined the ______________ of 
the Jewish work.  So, anyway, we had columns 
of people going out to work, different kind of 
work.  There were factories in _________ who needed
 chap labor.  There were all kind of things, 
and then there were places where the Jews
 who came into ____________ were selected and sent 
to other little concentration camps where th
ey slept and ate and again were under other 
supervision, but they all belonged to th
at ____________ headquarters.  I stayed in 

_____________ headquarters.  That became my home.  I was not sent out to work.  I had a 

permanent job in the so called ______________.  I us
ed to take mostly care of the Ge rman 
uniforms, which were cleaned and darned and th
en they used to come  and exchange their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
34 
 
uniforms for uniforms.  I t  was part of the bi
g _____________ who used to get all the suitcases if 
you equivalent to the Auschwitz commando.  It wa
s equivalent in the way of work.  All the 
Germans us ed to be brought in Czechs who 
came by car and suitcases 
and under pretense of 
paradise, all their baggage was taken away a
nd was sent to ______________ and we used to sort 
the things.  Put valuables sepa
rate, ladies clothes, furs, and you know when you go on a voyage 
and leave everything behind, you take the very best
 with you.  So, the people in Germany had a 
hey day because all those things were taken by the 
Germans and sent to thei
r wives, their lovers, 
their whatever.  So, anyway, that was 
the assignme nt I had among other people. 
Q. So, in doing this, how did it f
eel.  Sort of strange going thro
ugh other people's  lives in a 
way?  
A. Yes, very strange.  Heartbreaking, if you had 
a heart left.  Wh en I say there were different 
standards of viewing life, that was one of them. 
 What pride.  There wa
s only the strongest who 
tried to keep on resemblance of a human being 
because the Germans did everythi ng possible to 
destroy it in  you and then you are __________________ 
.  So, and you did see it over and over 
among the surroundings of the Jews in camp in the barracks, how they behaved.  How some  tried 

to keep clean no ma tter what.  Others did not.  So
me tried to walk with 
a high head, others would 
just --it's  awful.  And then there always we
re some people above you.  There always wa s that 
fear, that anxiety.  So, it was not
 easy to keep your dignity about it.  There was nothing to feed it 
on.  But still we ma naged.  I think that was one of 
the biggest victories that
 the Jews showed, that 
they did remain with some  dignity
 in spite of so ma ny losing it.  
And to me , every survivor is a 
hero if they could withstand all 
that and then join the world a
nd become  useful citizens.  So, 
heroism isn't necessarily groups of
 soldiers attacking and doing.  That wasn't  heroism because 
hunger was rampant.  Actions were taking place.  
You had to separate from your loved ones.  If 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
35 
 
you came together, me n went one way, wome n went 
another way.  Children went the third way.  
They still came with ch
ildren from some  places and then you 
being separated and so that's what 
concentration camp was.  But, I think in that 
particular time you don't compare.  I didn't  know 
about other ones and I thought that was hell.  I fi
nd out differently, but I had -- talking about my 
luck being at the right place at the right time 
is just unbelievable.  I was working in the 
______________ and just before Christma s '43, I would imagine, fire broke out in the 

_____________, and the _____________burned down.  Now, I was working there, and I was 

one of the last ones to leave th
e place and the next day I wassummoned to an interview with 

Doctor Longer, and if you're fa miliar with the lite
rature of the Holocaust a bit, he was one of the 
biggest sadist in the establishm
ent of the SS.  And when my na
me was called to be interviewed 
by him, everybody who knew me  wa s sure that wa s th
e last they'd see me . 
 He interviewed me  
for two hours.  I don't know if I was dumb, naive,
 stupid or some thing, I 
don't know what he was 
fishing for, but I didn't ha ve to avoi d what he 
was fishing for because I had no idea what he was 
fishing for, but he interviewed me  in a very ki
nd way for two hours.  He dismissed me  back to 
camp.  But t hose were the ways of the Germans.  
Now, he 's  known to be the biggest brute.  He 
was in charge  of all the Je ws in that  pa rt of Eu
rope.  All the camps, little camps, small camps and 
so on, the biggest sadist ever.

 Tape 
3 
 
A. Well, I would say I was privileged.  I didn'
t have to go outside the camp.  I stayed in 
camp.  My job was pretty protected.  The weather 
did not affect me .  I could be choosy in some  
articles of clothes, I had either access to it.
  Oh, yes, I think it was a privileged job. 
Q. When you say you had easy access to certain pieces of clothing, what did you do with 

them? 

A. You steal them, and you use them or you se
ll them.  I did not sell them.  It wasn't  
some thing that I wanted or needed, but occasiona
lly I would see a 
sweater that was pretty so I 
could put it on, and the people who di
dn't have access to it, could not. 
Q. But didn't you have to have this uni
form?   How could you have this sweater? 
A. You wore it underneath or you know, and since 
I was working inside, that's part of the 
privilege. 
Q. What about trading thes
e clothes for extra food? 
A. Lots of people did that.  When they had access to it, lots of people didthat.  It was just  an 
instinct in some  people.  I never 
needed very much, so I had no need to do it, or desire, or was 
too scared.  I mi ght have just been scared. 

Q. Now, in working in this ____________, you pr
obably had a good idea of transports 
comi ng in?  

A. Yes, we did.  And there were lots of transp
orts comi ng in and some  of them were sent out 
to work.  We had no gas chambers around, so either 
the people were shot or they went to other 
places to work.  So, that was a fairly mild
 concentration camp, I would say, on a scale of 
comparison. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
37 
 
Q. Where were these transports comi ng from? 
A. Mostly Germany, Hungary, Czechos lovakia.
  As time progressed and more and more 
Jews were sent out from Europe, that's  where 
they were comi ng from.  And there was a little 
sleepy station, a ____________, and God is that clea
r in my mi nd, all those SS standing there 
when the doors opened and those hundreds of people 
giving out and I did vis
it that place after the 
war and it wa s just mi nd boggling.  Peaceful, quiet, 
what Jews, what transports, what Hitler, 
what Germa ns, none of that. 

Q. Were there children at ______________? 

A. There were transports comi ng in with child
ren.  The children were not very long there.  
They were sent out. 

Q. Was there any resist ance? 

A. In ______________, no I don't think so.  Not in ______________.  What was happening 

to me  personally let's say in _____________, I found si
nce we no longer have any home  life, any 
home  things, that we were just  indi vidua
ls bonding and developing of new fa milies was 
fabulous.  I still have now -- it's 55 years late
r -- I still have friends in ______________ who we 
see very often, meet very often.  
It's  like fa mily.  And such fr
iendship did develop I think much 
more in ____________ concentration camp than any place else.  I don't know about other 

concentration camps, but we had very strong 
ties to people whom we didn't know before. 
Q. You would help each other? 

A. Oh, morally, it was just and I have about five
, six, seven friends who are just wonderful.  

I met some wonderful, wonderful people.  I met 
my husband there, not this one.  I me t him to, 
but another one. 

Q. When you weren't working, how did you and your new friends spend your time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
38 
 
A. Just sitting on the wooden planks talki
ng.  There was no entertainment.  There was no 
stimulation of -- there was nothing to feed your mi
nd or expand it or look what happens outside.  
We were completely cut off from the outsi
de.  There was no communication.  So, you just 
bonded with yourself, trying to reme mber, keep strong, that's  not what you're going to become  if 

you ever survive.  That was my thinking.  Now, 
that's  not the way to behave.  All those little 
things.  There was nothing to feed our mi nds 
and develop us.  Some  Ghettos had schools and 
what not.  Concentration camps did not.  My concentration camp did not. 

Q. What did you dream about? 

A. In camp, I imagine freedom.  That was a farfetched dream.  I know what I'm drea mi ng of 

now, it's concentration camp. 

Q. When you were in camps , did you think about what you would do if you got out? 

A. As a profession? 

Q. Justyourlife? 
A. I didn't know what I'd do with my life, but
 I knew I was not going to carry my education 
from concentration outside concentration camp.  
I'm not going to slam my fist and say you owe 
me .  I f I want to become  a part of society and ev
idently if I want freedom, 
that's what I want, that 
I will ha ve to adjust and nobody el
se is going to adjust to me . 
Q. You thought this at the time ?  

A. Yes.  And that was my firm convictio
n.  Maybe that's  what you are talking about. 
Q. Anything more about just th
e physical conditions at ______________? 
A. _____________ physical conditions were not too ba
d.  There were three barracks.  Two 
for wome n, one for me n and then there was 
an extra barrack for 
non-Jewish workers. 
Q. How ma ny i n a barrack? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
39 
 
A. There wasn't  so ma ny in __________, so it couldn't  be too tremendous.  But my husba nd 
built ______________. 
Q. Your husband now? 
A. No. 

Q. Your for mer husband? 

A. Yes.  He built ________________, so he was an ex
cellent architect, so he built it well.  
There was a lot of stealing of mate
rial from the outside so we had washrooms, which is just not 
the usual feature of the concentration camp.  So, t hat's why I say ______________ was not the 

worst.  Once you survived, once you're there, onc
e you worked, it was not worst.  We  used to 
take walks.  I reme mber my girlfriend and I 
we were 17 or 18 and we walked for hours around, 
around, and around talking about our fa milies.  I had 
a sist er and I had mother and I had a this 

and how was it.  And that friend of mi ne, sh
e 's very interesting.  It was in ______________ that 
she was sent out on what we call ________________, di
fferent locations and she was brought to 
_________________ and the woma n, the SS woma n that I told you about, the young chick with 

the white blouse, she recognized my girlfriend.  
She was a shoes sales girl in my girlfriend's 
home  town and was fitting shoes on Trudy.  So, she knew the fa mily and she recognized her, and 

she was very kind to her, to Trudy, and I was Tru
dy's best girlfriend, so she was kind to me  too.  
So, that's like an extra bit of priv
ilege you pick up here and there. 

Q. You said you me t your husband in this camp?
  You were allowed to socialize with the 
me n?  

A. No.  But you never asked permission.  First of all my husband had more  freedom of 

walking around since he was taking care of th
e barracks and the camp and the buildings and 

whatnot.  No, we were not allowed to socialize bu
t that didn't stop us from socializing.  It was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
40 
 
one of those unwritten laws.  You go to wor
k, boy meets girls, you know you don't have much to 
live.  You get acquainted.  These kinds of things. 
 I think that's the hardest part for people who 
are not in camp to understand it, but
 it was a part of social life, if
 you wish.  The encounters were 
very brief.  You just looked through the barb
ed wire and waved, you know, that kind of thing. 
Q. Were people able to have sexual relationships in camp?  
A. I don't think so, but I'm sure too that was 
done.  I would not like to put it that kind of 
thing, life wasn't  so bad, no it wasn't  that way. 

Q. How long were you in ________________? 

A. I got to ________________ in '43 and was shipped out in '44, so I was about a year there. 

Q. How did that come  about? 

A. That I was shipped out? 

Q. Yes.  At what point di
d you leave, what happened? 
A. I stayed in ___________ until the Germans werestarting to lose the war, and the troops 
were comi ng back and the Russians were comi ng cl
oser and closer.  There was an order to kill 
every Jew.  We don't  want any traces.  
My commandant of ____________ decided now wait a 
mi nute, I lose my ca mp, I go to the front.  So 
he decided to take his Jews, his machinery and 
bring them t o Germany and open a little camp on 
his own, and that did not ma ke hi m go to the 

front.  That's  what his intent was.  So, he we
nt to the harbor, when the Russians were comi ng 
closer and closer and closer, we
nt to the harbor, bought off a cap
tain, who threw off the German 
soldiers comi ng back from the front, and put his Jews on it.   

Q. So he transported you to the harbor? 

A. He went with us on the ship and we were heading to Poland.   

Q. How did you get there, by truck? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
41 
 
A. No, we walked.  
Q. What was the commander's name ? 

A. Seller (ph.) and that's  how we got to _____________. 

Q. How ma ny went with you? 

A. I don't quite know.  It was a boat full. 

Q. Severalhundred? 

A. Yes.  Everything was liquidate
d from ______________.  The whole ____________ went 
there plus people who were on outside commando
s, which belonged to -- Hank was there, I was 
there. 

Q. So, ma ybe thousands of people? 

A. Yes.  And then we got on that boat left ___________, and got to ______________.  First 

we went to __________, the waterway and from there 
were transported on 
barges to Studthoff. 
Q. What happened to this Mr. Seller's  camp?  
A. Nothing. 
Q. Tell me  about your arrival at St udthoff?  

A. We get there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. 

Q. When was this, do you reme mber? 

A. Yes.  September. 

Q. September'44? 

A. Right.  A beautiful Sunday afternoon.  Th
e sun is shining and we were just facing 
beautiful forest and little home s 
with little flower boxes and the music is playing.  The further we 
ma rch, the grayer it gets.  The fo
rest disappears.  The music di
sappears.  The houses disappears 
and it's just grey, grey, grey.  A
ll the stretch of barrack
s and that was Studthoff.  So, if I ever 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
42 
 
thought I suffered and went th
rough horrible times, nothing prep
ared me  for Studthoff.  We  
came, why i t  was important that we came  on 
a Sunday afternoon, because they expected our 
transport.  They lost patience, most SS was out
 so we did not go imme diately through the best 
process, so we had our clothes on, the one
s we brought with us from ________________.  That 
was good.  Then we were put into barracks which were
 horrible, and I guess th
e longer I will talk 
about Studthoff, I will use the word horribl e desc
ribing all kinds of situations, because it just  
beyond any imagination.  It was mi serable concen
tration camp, or home or  Ghetto, it was just a 
horror.  We  were put into the barracks.  I re
me mber I was placed in barrack 20 where there was 
only one after another those -- what do you call it 
-- slots, what they cal
l beds, four high, three 
that way, just assigned a place somebody else 
bl anket, no straw no nothing.  And some woma n 

who was in charge of that barrack, one was Je
wish and one was Polish and I don't know who was  
worse.  They were horrible.  They reduced us 
to just almost co mplete
ly void of any huma n 

feelings.  We'r e thrashed out on an appeal stood th
ere for hours, thrashed b
ack to the barracks.  
There was no work.  The chimneys were working.  You could smell the burning flesh. 

Q. You knew what that was? 

A. Oh, yes.  You could see it.  There was not
hing to do.  You we re just standing outside.  
Food was despicable.  There was no food.  Starva
tion, lice, going to the bathroom, bang, bang, 2 
o'clock at night everybody out.  2:05, everybody bac
k.  Sickness, dysentery, lice, just awful.  
That's an indescribable place.  The selections 
and what not  the ingenuity of the Jews is 
unbelievable.  Couldn't break our spirit.  We  all of a sudden I get the me ssage.  It's funny to get a 

me ssage in those circumstances.  There were wa
ys of communication.  Th
ere were always gutsy 
people who used to write a note.  I get a note 
from my husba nd telling me register on the 
___________ transport.  I said to my self, okay there 
is one person who lost his mi nd.  How can I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
43 
 
register on what.  There was a not
e back, sorry I am not on that tr
ansport.  So, the people who are 
going on the transport to ______________ were selected
 from different barracks.  There was 
about 200 women.  Well, I wasn't  one of them.  My
 girlfriend was.  In the meanti me , just as a 
side story, one night I get a me ssage it said Mrs.
 Pollock is in Studthoff and would I need her 
help.  Those were the wire fences and that was 
all electrically fed and 
so on.  I sneaked out at 
night to that fence and on the othe
r side is that woma n, and then sh
e says to me , "Bella, catch."   
And she throws me  her ration of bread.  She says 
I am going to the gas chamber.  You still have 
a chance.  And just disappeared in the night.  That
 was the last  time I ever saw her.  That's the 
kind of a person she was.  Going back to _______________.  Some how my husband ma naged -- 
Q. Your future husband? 

A. No, my firsthusband. 

Q. But you weren't ma rried yet? 

A. Yes, I got married in the _____________. 
Q. Oh, you didn't tell me  that.  You got ma rried at ________________? 
A. Yes.  You know ma rriage doesn't  necessar
ily have to have a canopy with candles and 
fancy dresses and feasts and whatnot.  It was 
I'll call it an official ceremo ny, whatever was 
official at that time .  The r e 
were witnesses and so on.  Not very ma ny people were privileged to 
go through that kind.  Anyway, my husband se
nds me  a note, you're going to go on the 
____________ transport and I had no idea how or 
what that ____________ transport was in the 
process of leaving Studthoff.  A
bout ten days back and forth diffe
rent reasons either they had no 
trucks or they had no cars.  There was a war 
going on.  Germany was fighting the war.  There 
preference number one was destruction of the Jews
.  There was a transport of people leaving for 
_____________ and as they got them transport out of th
e gate, I was added to the transport.  So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
44 
 
were ten other girls, my girl
friend.  Unfortunately unknown to them they were Germa n born and 
in the last second, they decide
d not to send the Ge rman born people back to Germany.  I was 
born in Poland.  And they documents, they had 
papers, they had registrations, kept precise 
records.  My close friend _________ stayed behin
d.  We ll, I did not stay with her, I left. 
Q. How long had you been in Studthoff 
just so I get a sense of the time? 
A. Probably not longer than six weeks? 

Q. You didn't work there or anything? 

A. There was no work.  Probably couldn't  surviv
e more than another week or so.  That's  how 
terrible conditions were.  As 
a ma tter of fact I know now pe
ople who survived Studthoff. 
Q. Was it a big camp?  

A. Yes.  It was a destruction camp.  It was 
not a work camp like Auschwitz was some  times.  
Studthoff was not. 

Q. So most people that went to Studthoff -- 
A. Did not survive, except at the earlier stage 
when they needed working hands for the farm, 
and those younger people who got out on the farm, so
me  of t hem survived because they were not 
in Studthoff.  But at that time when I got there 
there was no need for workers any more.  It was 
just a ma tter of how fast can you get rid of what
 you have.  How fast can you get rid of the Jews 
you have. 
Q. Most of the people who were there were Jewish? 

A. All of them were Jews were we were. 

Q. There were wo me n a
nd me n, mostly wome n?  
A. There were mostly women.  Men were on th
e other part of camp, but mostly wome n. 

Q. What did you do during the day? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
45 
 
A. Probably stood outside on an appeal
 plots, supervised
 stay, jump.   
Q. That's it? 
A. There was illness, the sickness, diarrhea, dysente
ry.  As a ma tter of f
act, we were the last 
transpor t to leave Studthoff, because once we 
left ___________.  So when we did get finally to 
___________, we were ___________ for two weeks.  But I could not have survived Studthoff 

and I don't know anyone who did who was not sent out by some  sheer luck before.  So, I don't 

know.  I'm not aware that there we
re people liberated in St udthoff. 
Q. Did they give you food in Studthoff? 

A. Very, very little. A thin slice if you weren't ki
lled before, dirty water, so that to me  it was 
probably the worst concentration cam
p ever.  Something puzzles you? 
Q. What was the effect of these conditions on 
the people who lived there?   The inma tes, did 
it bring out the worst in them?  

A. The very worst, except if you had some  ve
ry dear close friends like I had my friend but 
usually they were all strangers. 
I mean if you lie on those pieces of benches and you want to 
move, four other people have 
to mo ve.  You don't even know them, and they stink, and they'r e 
full of lice and -- 

Q. Did you have lice on you? 

A. Yes. 

Q. When you say it brings out the worst, what does that mean? 

A. It means I don't care about you.  If I want to
 go to that bathroom and you're in front of 
me , I don't  care.  That kind of just to ma ke it 
descriptive to you since you weren't there so other 
things would have a hard time visually it, you know. 

Q. Stealing?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
46 
 
A. Sure.  What ever you had, and you didn't have much and you could hear screams in the 
night.  Some body attacks you.  Hunger is a terribl
e, terrible thing and can do to you no ma tter 
what your principl es and morality is.  I mean 
hunger, I don't mean just  being hungry, but hunger.  
So, yes, again, I was fortunate to 
get out of _____________ and get to ____________, which 
really was not a concentration camp.  It was 
a part of the concentration camp just like 
______________ had different places where they send the 
Jews.  We  were a part of Buchenwald 

and there was an ammuni tion factory, and that's  wh
ere they needed some  labor.  They sent them 
the front, they needed people to produce work, so
 they just took some  from Studthoff and that's 
where we got to _______________ and worked in an a
mmunition factory.  It was not the normal 
set up of a lot of SS, there were no gas chambers. 
 There were places they could send us but that 
was not the set up.  So, we worked.  It was fair
ly clean and again you formed groups with most 
of the people you came from Studthoff so you were 
already had a family.  We already belonged 
together.  Same  upbringing so to say.  Until the Americans -- 
Q. Wait, before we get to that, I wa
nt to hear a little bit more about _____________. 
A. Okay. 
Q. You were able to see your husband there? 

A. Yes, he did not work in the 
factory.  He was an inside work
er.  He was a civil engineer by 
profession and he was older.  He was more experi
enced and kind of out of respect, so he never 
worked in the factory, but he was fr
eely communi cating between the camps. 
Q. What were the general conditions?  Were 
you in the barracks. Did you live in a barracks? 
A. Well, we were living in the barracks, 
had the same  wooden kind of pieces.  Food was 
given out by the you know they had a set ma ny ra
tions of bread and soup.  We kept it fairly 
clean.  There was not that constant fear of 
SS stormi ng in, so it was a much more relaxed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
47 
 
atmosphere.  And then we used to go work 
in the factory, you did mi ngle with the Germans 
because you all were involved in pr oducing ammunition.  We  were just additiona l help.  So, you 
could move around.  It wa sn't  that tight supervision by SS.  That lasted until Ja nuary '45 when 

the first wave of American bombers attacked
 _____________ and three quarte
rs of the city was 
bombed and fire and there was no work because  
the factory was not destroyed.  It was very 
careful bombing.  The camp was not attacked.  The 
factory wa s not attacked.  Three quarters of 
the city was in rubble.  We were used to go out a
nd help clean the city.  That was the assignment.  
As a ma tter of fact, we never worked again in 
that factory because if the factory was almost 
ready to be workable, one plane came and drop
ped one bomb on the water supply and just got 
the factory out of circulation. 

Q. So you were out on the streets? 

A. Well, there's more going out on the streets, 
cleaning the rubble and cleaning up the street 
and waiting until we ca n go back to work and continue.  So fa r they di d not send us back to 
Buchenwald because they did expect to have th
e factory working again. 
 They never did.  And 
what would you like to know next?   Ho
w did we  get rid of the Germans? 
Q. Well, a question about th
is ____________ it seemed 
like it was a little
 bit easier than 
_________________? 
A. Ohyes. 

Q. Was there any sense of norma lcy? 

A. When you mean nor ma lcy --? 

Q. Did people have a social life, anything? 

A. No.  It was still just a barrack and when 
night comes and you come back from the night 
shift then close the door and that was it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
48 
 
Q. The guards weren't as horrible? 
A. No, there wasn't  that ma ny guards so it like
 on a scale of comparison, that was paradise. 
Q. Now, when you were out cleaning up the 
rubble and cleaning up the streets, did you 
come  in contact with the local people? 

A. I didn't do it. 

Q. Oh, you didn't do it? 

A. I personally did not. 

Q. So, what were you doing at this point? 

A. Mostly we were sometimes sitting in the 
barracks and waiting.  Some times we would go 

to the factory and clean up the factor
y.  Mostly me n did the cleaning up. 
Q. In the factory you were working with German civilians? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever have any conversation 
about what was going on in the world? 
A. Politically? 

Q. Thewar? 

A. No. 

Q. TheJews? 

A. No. 

Q. You just worked side by side? 

A. Yes, and one of the co-workers of mi ne, 
denounced me  when I was just that short of 

being liberated. 

Q. You want to tell me  about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
49 
 
A. Sure.  We ll, as the war wa s getting closer a
nd closer and closer, and 
that must have been 
April, now I'm back to April.  From January
 to April it was off work, on work, and so on.  
Americans were getting closer and if 
you want to know about ______________, it was located 
on the ____________ and it had a hi storical me aning because that's wha t  our friends were 
supposed to get together and throw arms around e
ach other and declare peace for ever after.  
That was supposed to take place on the _________, and we were right there.  On April 14, 16th 

some thing like that, the order came  to ge
t the Jews out of _____________.  Bring them towards 
Berlin.  We  cannot leave them for the Yankees.  So, 
that's  what they did.  they lined us all up and 
we were ready for our march towards Berlin. 
 An SS woma n come s into camp and announces 
that the Americans are in town.  
So whoever guarded us and wanted 
to go with us to Berlin, just 
took off, and here we were in front of the ga
tes without any SS the Americans are here, which 
really does mean you'r e free, and all we could do is
 stare at each other in complete disbelief.  

What the hell's going on.  What do you mean we're fr
ee.  Wh at's free?   Until we realized that we 
really have no Germans watching over us.  No SS, and what do you do with freedom?  You turn 

right back and go into camp.  We didn't know 
the city.  We  didn't know who was going to do 
what.  That was home  so ever
ybody went -- almost everybody went back to camp and plundered 
the supplies and had a party and celebrated free
dom.  Except my husband, 
myself, my girlfriend 
and her boyfriend.  My husband said, "Hey, I did 
not see an American.  I am not going back to 
camp."  So, we left camp.  We
 ma rched outside, didn't know the location.  The Germa ns had 
little houses where they took care of
 their gardens.  We  went there and found a house.  Went into 
the baseme nt and sure enough Americans did 
not enter __________ yet.  
Later on we find out 
Eisenhower said "No, No, wait for the Russians.  
That's our agreement."  So, the troops were 
there and they did not enter the city.  The 
Germa ns pulled together and surrounded the camp.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
50 
 
Everyone out, told them to ma rch to Berlin. 
 So we were some  place in the fields in 
_______________.  We  were there for about four or fi
ve days.  The Germans were looking for 
the Jews because they knew that some  Jews just
 escaped some  place and they fished us out and 
we had some people who were not Jewish who worked for ___________, the so called 

_________________.  They had different rules and regula
tions than we did.  My husband was in 
very good standing with the Russian generals.  So, wh
en they fished us out and the girl said he's 
not Jewish.  So he didn't have to go with the 
Germans, and he dragged me  and that was fine 
except that German mei ster I was working for said "S
he is Jewish.  She worked for me."  So, that 
was the end of that.  My husband went with me
.  We were going towards Berlin and the night 
was terrible.  It was shooting, stormi ng.  You coul
d feel the woods just going through you so the 
next time we got into a ditch, including the Ge
rmans because they were petrified.  When the 
shooting stopped, everybody got up.  We  stayed in 
the ditch and went in 
a different direction.  
We didn't know where we were, but went in a di
fferent direction, but it 
was such a bad night -- 
and if we saw a patrol they spoke to us Germ
an.  We spoke to them Ger man and we just 
continued and find a place again in
 one of those huts that the Germans ha d.  We  stayed there for 
a while until the German population of that pl
ace came over.  We  could hear them comi ng, 

looking for Jews.  We  decided it's time  to leav
e that pl ace and find another one.  We didn't where 
to go.  Looked at the name  of the street--and again people were walking because some  were 

caught in one part of the town, ot
her ones were caught in a different 
part of town so we were just 
walking.  We saw a name of a st
reet and a direction and we deci
ded that's where we'r e going to 
go.  I was shaking like that.  I real
ly couldn't put a straight step, I 
was so petrified.  This is what 
we did.  We  just walked and walked and walk
ed, and all of a sudden we see some thing which 
looks like a ____________ off a Ger man patrol, but it wa
s too late to turn 
back.  So, we just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
51 
 
boldly continued.  The guy stopped us, 
leather jacket, not uniform, but
 leather jacket and he says 
where are you folks going, and we told him that we were going home  to _____________.  He 
said well the Germans left that establishment 
last night and I found a w
onderful desk which I'd 
like to take home , but my wagon broke, so if you'
re not in a terrible hurry could you help me  

carry that.  I will give  you some thing.  I don't ha
ve much, but a little sugar if you help me  carry 
that desk.  Hey, sure.  We didn't tell hi
m who we  are, and he
 did not suspect.   
Q. You weren't  wearing your camp uniforms?  

A. We no longer had --what we had striped clot
hes like that and I had a kerchief.  My 

husband had a regular suit which he 
prepared, and my girlfriend had 
a kerchief.  We  s poke fluent 
German.  When he took us to his bombed out hous
e, we helped him carry the desk he wanted, 
and we started talking a while and my husband and 
my friend said to him, hey there are so ma ny 
other good things there.  He said
 yes but how am I going to carry
 them.  He said, okay we don't 
care.  We 'll stay here a night and help you tomor r
ow and it developed into a two week stay at his 
house.  Things were a little touchy because 
he had a girlfriend who had a niece and she 

socialized with the German soldie
rs, and they came  at night to vi
sit, so we had conversations and 
they told me  why don't I come  to their barracks, th
ey had food left over.  It
 became  a little sticky.  
And we hear the Americans entered the ot
her side of ______________,and now we are divided 
by the _____________ river.  So, we decided to 
go over to the Americans, we found s o me  
German uniforms.  I became -- my husband beca
me  a lieutenant I don't know, and my girlfriend 
some  kind of ranking German official, and we deci
ded to go as prisoners of war to the American 
Ar my.  So, we found a boat, ma de some  oars, 
and hooked up with seven other German soldiers 

who are sick and tired of being 
treated like second hand citizens as they had no intentions of 
going to the front.  When they found out that
 we are going over to the ___________ they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
52 
 
too happy to join us.  So, we had seven German s o
ldiers, two Jewish me n and two Jewish girls.  
We took a trip around 6:00 at night and they had th
eir revolvers all ready. 
 If there is a Hitler 
they are going to shoot at them and they are going 
to shoot back and we had a white flag ready.  
We got over to the other side of the ______________
-- the first thing we did was push the boat 
back into the _________ if the Ame r icans get any br
illiant ideas to send us back, we have no 
transpor tation.  We walked for a while with our 
white flag and there was no American in sight, 
but neither was anybody else.  So, we just walk
ed and walked and walked and finally come  
across two Americans who said hi 
and I said to my girlfriend how
 are we going to tell him that 
we are not German.  They'r e Americans.  They 
speak English.  My girlfriend said, "Don't worry.  
I took four years of English in high school, no pr
oblem."  So a nyway they are bringing us as 

prisoners of war and I said, "Bessi
 tell him, tell him."  And she sa
id nothing.  So, we were taken 
as prisoners of war to the headquarters of the Am
ericans.  It was May 1.  Getting upstairs the two 
girls separate and the nine me n 
downstairs.  I said wait a mi nute,
 American headquarters.  I am 
used to the Polish discipline, the German disciplin
e, and here are the hea
dquarters.  Here are the 
guys sitting in a room with thei
r collars open, feet on the desk a
nd American headquarters.  Now, 
we go through the process of telling them we 'r
e not Germans. We  sit down, show them, they 
don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  Th
ey never saw a prisoner.  They never saw a 
concentration camp inmate.  It's a 
fighting line. It's a fighting sold
iers.  It took I'd say about an 
hour because they brought every soldier speaking
 every language to try to communicate because 
we sounded so urgently trying to tell them so
me t hing to finally some one who speaks Polish in 
that room.  I  said well, they just
 went wild, literally wild.  They didn't know what to do with us.  
I said the first thing you do is 
get those two guys out of the base
me nt there because they are the 
real Germans, which they did.  They all came  
ups tairs and those soldiers really did not know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
53 
 
what to do with us.  They had a concentration 
camp, but they were the fighting troops.  They 
were still fighting the war.  The war was not ove
r.  They put us on a jeep.  Found us a place, you 
know lots of Nazis left town, established, br
ought us a house and then we re bringing us 
everything which there kitchen had.  Every two mi nut
es a truck load of food came on the table.  I 
mean just talk about unbelievable happiness, and th
at's just a side story 
because when we were 
brought into that hous
e with all that food, I reme mber what 
I said to myself.  If you're ever 
liberated, you're going to be a human being right
 from mi nute one.  So, I asked the American 
soldiers to gi ve me a white table 
cloth and some  dishes.  The three of
 them were ready to kill me .  
They were starved and I said, no.  And then we 
set the table and had some  candles and had our 
first meal as liberated people. 
Q. With your dignity in tact? 

A. Right.  And that's  how we were liberated. 

Q. How long were you at this place before you fe
lt free -- were you free at
 this point to just 
move around and do what you wanted? 

A. We could, but we didn't.  It was very shaky, 
very uncomfortable.  But then we got used to 

it.  We  got a nicer house and we contacted lots 
of people who were liberat
ed different ways and 
we had party.  So, we were free.  We reallywere free.  There were no Germans and we were 

under the American occupation.

 Tape 
4 
 
A. We were liberated May 1 in
 ____________,and it was the outskirts of _____________ 
and eventually the Americans were so wonderful and found us a home, a house, when my 
girlfriend and I and my husband and her boyfri
end lived.  Then we went to town to ________ 
and found out other people who survived different
 ways, they kind of congregated more in two 
or three houses in the center of
 the city.  So, we didn't see too much of them, but we knew of 
them and stayed there until the rumors headed th
at the Russians were coming.  I think that was 
the sequence of the events.  And no way would we stay under the Russian occupation.  So, we 

just stepped left of ______________ and again towards 
the American zone, Frankfurt.  At that 

time, we had a car because this on the lighter si
de.  As the Jews were cleaning up the city of 
____________ from the bombing, a friend of ours discove
red a car in the garage.  The house was 
burned, the garage was not.  The 
car was standing there so afte
r the war and we needed some  
transportation he said to my husband hey I'm going to
 sell you that car.  So, they went to the 
American authorities got a permit 
to dig out the car.  He posed as a German some  executive.  
They dug the car out and then my fr iend sold the 
car to my husband.  They went to the American 
authorities, got it all stamped 
and now we owne d the car. 
Q. Was there gasoline? 

A. No, but we got rations.  Then we left
 ____________ and went towards Frankfurt, I think.  
Anyway, so it was some  sets of different friends
.  I think Hank was w
ith us on that journey. 
Q. Hank your present husband? 

A. Yes, but he was a very good friend of the fa
mily all those years.  He was really a good 
friend of my  husband.  I'm not clear.  Firs
t we went -- as we were leaving ____________ we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
55 
 
were driving along and we came across a beautiful lo
cation and I read in German that that was a 
French zone.  So, we stopped on a Saturday afte
rnoon and we said we are refugees from ca mp 
and we need some  quarters and soon we got a 
house designated for us.  WE took our car and 
took possession of the house and 
in that beautiful town of 
_____________, and we stayed in that 
house in _____________ for about six weeks.  At the time , Hank registered hims elf as a 

Frenchma n.  So, here we lived very 
happily in _____________ doing nothing, acting like 
imbeciles.  Laughing, having fun playing game s, complete now all of a sudden a notice come s 

there is a Frenchma n who doesn't  want to go hom
e.  We ll, that Frenchma n did not want to go 
home , so we had to pack up and leave 
____________ and go some place else when they don't 

want Frenchme n to go home.  So we  just left 
_________ and went to Frankfurt.  Frankfurt there 
is a funny story about the 
car but it's really of no importance, 
so anyway, we got to Frankfurt and 
we went to ___________.  That's where Jews congregate.  Salsheim was  a place where D.P.s 

were comi ng from all around so when we got 
to Frankfurt we too went to Salsheim. 
Q. Wasn't  there some  sort of infor mal ne
twork so you knew about Salsheim and you knew 
about certain places? 

A. Well, not officially.  There was no networ
k.  You just used your common sense, well 
where it would it be.  Headquarters of the American
s would be Frankfurt.  Salsheim is where the 
D.P.s are, so that's how I got to Salsheim. 

Q.  Now, it's be en I guess a couple months, two 
or three months since you've been liberated, 
right? 

A. Right. 

Q. Was there any effort to figure ou
t whether you had fa mily still alive? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
56 
 
A. Well, that's where Hank come s in.  Th
ere was a tracing bureau opened where you asked 
about your families.  D.P. camps, where you regi ster
ed and so on, so there was an effort to find 
out.  And that's what Hank did. 
Q. But up to this point you weren't able? 

A. No, there was no ma il.  There was no rail
s.  There was no transportation.  There was no 
telephone.  There was nothing. 

Q. And you hadn't thought about going back to Poland? 

A. Notme . 

Q. So you went to Salsheim? 

A. I went to Salsheim.  I got a job in the o
ffice and we did register
 people who were looking 
for relatives and now the next t
hought is what are you goi
ng to do with the rest
 of your life.  You 
don't want to stay in Germany.  We  knew that we 
wanted to go to the United States.  There was a 
very strong push of having displaced persons go to
 Palestine and there were a lot of single 
displaced persons and a lot of them did go to Pa
lestine.  So, I had a hous
e in Salsheim and we 
lived there.  I worked in an office. 

Q. What were the conditions like in the camp, in Salsheim? 

A. Barracklife. 

Q. You lived with other people in the barracks? 

A. Yes.  But we did not.  We rented a house. 

Q. Withwhat? 

A. I worked.  I worked in camp so I got paid 
so first I rented a room
 and then I got a better 
position because I worked for the ___________ so I rented a house and paid with px cigarettes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
57 
 
So, we were the older couple.  My husband and 
I more mature and in the meantime I met my 
sister.  No, she met me. 
Q. How did that happen? 

A. Unknown to me , she went through a different
 way.  I didn't know she was alive or not, 
but she had her sister must be alive, so she le
ft.  Mother, who had a boyf
riend at that time in 
Poland, and ventured out to dp camps to find her 
sister.  And one day I walk in Salsheim on the 
premise of the camp and, what I was doing was 
going to camp to get some hot water because I 
had a beauty parlor appointme nt.  You had to br
ing your hot water with you.  And I didn't have 
the facilities at home so that's where I wasgoing, and passing a group of friend stopped me , and I 

chatted for a few mi nutes and then they say hey before you take off, how about saying hello to 

your sister.  I looked at her.  She 
looks at me .  It was five years si
nce I didn't see her.  So, from a 
little girl she grew up.  So, that's  how she found me
.  So, I didn't go to the beauty parlor.  I went 
back home a nd I said to my husband, "Hey, you ma rri
ed a girl without a fa mily, here she is."  
Now, he wa s fully aware of her because I spoke an awful lot about her. 

Q. And she told you that your
 mother was still alive? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What happened to your father? 
A. My father was killed. 

Q. Nobody every saw him again.  Three out of four. 

A. But she had a boyfriend and she ma rried hi
m and she lost him five years ago and life 

stopped existing for her and no way.  
We  tried to take care of her,
 but it got difficult.  And my 
sister just go adjusted to 
life in the United States.  She 
graduated nursing school.  She got 
ma rried, had a wonderful son and tw
o grandchildren, comfortably off. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
58 
 
Q. So, in Salsheim you wor ked in the office? 
A. Yes.  And then one day they said _______________ he opened the door and he says, 

"Wow do I have a deal for you? "   He me t a 
ma n from the United States and Hank is very 
friendly, so started talking to the ma n and the man 
was desperate.  He needed some  help.  He is 
from the highest immi gration department of th
e United States and the 
quota will open and he 
wants to get refugees into the United State.  
He cannot do it all by hims elf.  Hank says, okay I 
will help you, and then it became too much for Hank and then he just sa id to me  hey, Blondie, do 

I have deal for you.  I know that ma n who needs 
help so that's  how we started working for the 
__________.  I quit my job in the office and that
 was a much more prestigious job. 
Q. Was this actually within the camp or was it separate? 

A. It wasn't  camp, no.  It was in Frankfurt. 

Q. What were you doing with them, for t hem?    

A. Collecting future applicants and __________ 
was a very knowledgeable person about the 
immi gration in the United States 
and he said I know that the year
 ends and then the quota will 
have to be filled, so let's prepare papers.  When 
the open the consulate, I want to be able to get 
those papers in and say here, so that's  whatwe were doing, collecting information.  And it was a 

very complicated thing.  There we
re no papers.  There were no reco
rds.  There were no pencils, 
no pictures no nothing.  So, we work
ed very, very hard almost fr
om door  to door to a displaced 
person to a displaced person.  Finding a photographer.
  Paying with our cigarettes which we got 
in the px.  That was the best money available.  
So, we had a folder, a complete file when the 

immi gration opened, and I would say probably 70 pe
rcent of the applicants were submitted by us 
to the departme nt of i m mi gration.  The___________ started working on it an other 

organizations, but we had the whole file ready. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
59 
 
Q. Anything else you can tell me  about
 _____________ about your own experience, the 
conditions in the camp, the way that peopl
e started trying to reclaim their lives? 
A. It was a temporary kind of 
quarters.  I don't think it was ba
d.  It still was communal living 
and that did not stop until people st
arted to disperse.  It had a hosp
ital.  It  had social  activities. 
Q. Jobtraining? 
A No, there were no jobs.  Everything was in ruin
s, but it was like kind 
of step by step to a 
norma l life trying to find relatives.  Trying to fi
nd out where I am going.  Groups formed, social 
groups formed so and the Germans were trying to
 get you into the gas chambers.  That was the 
thought of enjoying life. 

Q. How long did you stay in the Frankfurt area? 

A. Until the first boat left for the States in '
46, and I also put an application to go to the 
United States like my husband did, but my boss felt th
at he could not spare us if we went with 
the first boat, so he got permission with the St
ate Department here to 
still go under the old quota 
go with the next ship.  So, I left in July. 

Q. Of'46?  

A. Yes. 

Q. Who traveled with you? 

A. My sister, my husband, plus all the other 
refugees who were entering the United States 
under quotas, affidavits. 

Q. Do you remember the trip over and how you were feeling? 

A. Yes, I felt lousy.  I was sick as could be.  The voyage was not a pleasant one, but we 

came in ma ke shift boats.  I didn't take the trip very well.  So, I was an escort. 

Q. You were an escort? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
60 
 
A. For the other people.  It 
was kind of American -- uniform. 
Q. When you arrived, do you reme mbe r  your first impressions? 
A. Yes.  My husband had a cousin here whom
 he didn't know who me t 
him at the boat and 
took us to their house.  They were lovely pe
ople and kind and good, and we stayed there for a 
little while.  My husband had a si
st er in Peoria so naturally th
at is where we  were going, my 
husband and my sister and I.  We
 got to Peoria.  She had just lost her husband and there really 
wasn't  very much for us to do unfortunately.  We  didn't speak English.  Their community was 

very willing.  They were so ha
ppy to finally have refugees and do some thing for them, they were 
willing to give us money.  Well, money we did not
 want.  We  wanted to learn English, get a job 
and so on.  That was very tough because let's face it,
 I had no qualifications.  They finally got me  
a job in a sewing factory.  Princess Pe ggy's they us
ed to ma ke frocks or some thing like that.  I 
worked there for a whole two weeks, but at the e
nd of day every day, the girl who supervised the 
work, came over ripped out what I did, because I 
didn't know how to use a sewing ma c hine.  So, 
if you have to put fancy things on it, you know, th
e ma terial went and the other part we nt.  I 
really could never ma ster that art.  I didn'
t know how to speak English, and I was very unhappy 
there.  Then my mother was comi ng to the St
ates, so my husband says okay, I go to New York 
and pick up your mother and you stay here.  That's 
what he did.  Then he told me  he 's not going 
back to Peoria.  I said fine, I am comi ng to NewYork.  So, we left Peoria
 behind and got back to 
New York. 

Q. What were your first impressions 
when you came  to the United States? 
A. As far as people? 

Q. Was it some  sort of a culture shock at all? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
61 
 
A. No.  I reme mber my first ride in Central 
Park, and when I looked at
 the tall buildings and 
each building had a light in the window and I saidto myself, there is a family living every place 
behind that light.  That wa s very impressive.  Li
fe was not very easy to get adjusted and ma ke a 

living here. 

Q. What do you think gave you the strength and 
the courage to get th
rough all of this the 
way you did? 

A. I really could not answer
 that question, I don't know.  I just thought that's the way I 
should behave. 

Q. Did you think you would get through it? 

A. No, but did I really give up 
hope completely?   Pr obably not. 
Q. Is there anything that you can
 think of that kept you going? 
A. No, honestly I don't think it's a desire I have
 to survive to let th
e world know, I didn't 
think so.  I don't think that's what kept me  goi
ng.  I think it was selfish 
reason to survive and to 
live. 

Q. It's  interesting when you told me  you got ma rried at _______________, it strikes me  that 

here you were in a concentration camp, without 
much hope, some  man you've just basically me t 
-- 

A. Oh, but he was so terrific. 

Q. Okay, ma ybe you answered the question.  W
hy in these conditions
 did you get ma rried? 
A. Why not?   I mean, it's answering a question 
with a question, why not?   We ll, I'll tell you, 
if I wouldn't have gotten ma rried 
to him, and that wasn't  a pre 
thought idea, I would have never 
gotten out of Studthoff.  I only got out of Studthof
f because I was his wife, and me made a deal 
with a guy who was in charge of work division.  
He gave him his raincoat and my husband felt I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
62 
 
have nothing to lose.  He  can take it any time he
 wants to but he didn't.  He said you have my 
raincoat and you put my wife on that ____________ transp
ort.  That was not the reason I ma rried 
him.  But somehow that seemed that would be the 
better way to do it if we ever wanted to stay 
together. 
Q. So there was a thought that ma ybe there's a future there. 

A.   I said there always was otherwise you w
ouldn't just do what you did.  You just didn't know 
how you we re going to escape. 

Q. How important, if at all, was religion? 

A None to me . 

Q. Were you resentful of it? 

A. No. 

Q. Sorry you were Jewish? 

A. No, no problem.  I was amazed and probably happy for some  people who had that be lief 
and were going to the gas chambers with their 
hand and eyes to God, it's his will.  No, religion 
was of no importance to me . 
Q. And after the war? 

A. Nothing. 

Q. The other thing that we had talked about 
a little, do you think that the experiences were 
different as a woma n or as a girl 
than they were for boys and me n? 
A. The experience ma ybe were not but how it a
ffected the experiences of men or boys but 
for wome n t here was a di fference.  I think some
 of it is probably their upbringing of wome n 
always take care of some one, of
 something.  And even it the so
meone or something is just 
themselves, but it's just taking care of.  Men, the ma jority was brought up that some one takes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
63 
 
care of them because there was nobody to take care 
of them, they let themselves go much faster.   
Wome n bonding with other wome n because they n
eed that camaraderie probably more than men 
did.  That's  my observation, my explanation of it
.  So me n when they lost their pride, they 
became nothing.  There was no support group, whereas lots of wome n did find support groups 
some how.  Even the term was differ e nt, but ju
st that whole idea of 
you have to be clean, you 
have to fight a little, you have to
 you know, and here is a little gi
rl who needs help and so yes it 
depends on the woma n.  It just isn't a flat ru
le going for all woma nhood, but
 it was a certain trend 
of doing that.  On the othe r hand, I saw wome
n who went very willingl y on the bus train, 
whatever, car load, if their child was taken away 
from the m.  They didn't have to.  I didn't see 
me n doing it.  That doesn't  mean they didn't, but I didn't see it. 

Q. What about the way you were treated?   
We re you treated differently by the guards? 
A. In certain respect for wome n?  No. 

Q. Ordisrespect? 
A. No. 
Q. Was there an opportunity to wome
n to use their sex to get favors? 
A. Sometimes.  I don't think there was the same
 opportunity for men because whatever they 
presented would not be very attractive to th
e SS wome n that have ev
erything.  There were 
opportunities. 

Q. And that happened? 

A. I'msure. 

Q. This wasn't  a first hand experience of yours? 

A. My first experience, no, but I know that it
 happened.  I don't like to prove my point by 
name s and what not and having 
opinions about it or judgme nt. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
64 
 
Q. I'm just curious as to whether it went on and 
whether people were able to use that to their 
advantage? 
A. Sometimes they did and someti mes people 
did and could not.  And it wasn't  always 
possible.  There were times that it was po
ssible.  The will to life was very strong. 
Q. When you talk about the bonding between wo
me n, the relationships that were formed 
that really helped sustain you, were some
 of those relationship sexual as well? 
A. No, not that I know.  It's  not fair for me  
to say.  Not that I know.  Just loving some one 
and everytime I think of my girlfriend who st
ayed behind in Studthoff and lost her life --. 
Q. When you think back, and I'm sure you think 
back often, what images stick with you the 

most?   What haunts you the most. 

A. What hurts me the most I imagine the im
ages of seeing people loaded on trains to 
destination destruction and murder. 
 I think that's probably -- the 
rest kind of disappears.  So 
there was hunger so people were dead.  That hur
ts the most.  There was just no way out of it 
except luck. 

Q. What sort of long term i mpact do you 
think this has had on you and on your life? 
A. Long term impact?   Nightmares, waking up in
 sweat and fear until
 you realize there is 
nothing to fear.  There are no tr
ucks and SS and barracks and cham
bers and what not.  I think 
nightmares and thinki ng of all the ones who are no
 longer here.  It's not guilt.  I did not trade 

their places and vice versus.  It's  
just they were not as lucky as I 
was.  Most of it is luck.  It 
wasn't  the armi es helping to liberat e the inmates 
of concentration camps and all of that.  There 
was no country who really reached out to help us
.  So, it was luck, mostly, and if you call being 
at the right pl ace at the right time, that's a part 
of luck, so I don't know really why I am alive and 
some body is n't, but that is what the greatest impa ct
 is.  There was a very sad and those terms are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
65 
 
all fr om this world, and I am referring to the ot her world, after the war long after the war, the 
past four years, my husband Hank and I traveled 
to the eastern European countries and I did go 
to Wilno and I did go to Pornaty and I did go to _____________ and I did go to 

______________ and all those famo us places, and what 
I saw was a quiet peaceful world with 

all those lives disappearing to the ground a
nd burned and out of me mory a nd nothing, just 
nothing.  That was painful.  When I went
 to _____________ and I visited a very famous 

monume nt built by the ____________ of _________________ 
, a beautiful monument to the 
hundreds of people who were destroyed by the Ge
rmans, non-Jews, every half of mi nute the 

bells are ringing to remi nd people.  Well, that 
kind of hurt.  What happened to the six million 
Jews.  The same  way the Russians were probably 
helping to destroy.  One crime doesn't justify 
another.  It's just the me mory.  Those were 
the be lls every half a mi nute chimed and what 
happened to the six million Jews.  I can speak for them, that's all what's left  for the worl d not to 

forget them.   That's sad.  I can do the best I know how.  I think not of six million, but the very 
dear ones I came  across through my l i fe. 
Q. Is there anything else you'd like to add? 

A. I hope the world will not forget those peopl
e who died and don't consider every holocaust 

the same  kind of holocaust.  Death is the same , 
murder is the same , but the motives and the way 
it was done, the way it wa s done by civilized people, it
's not the same  as every holocaust.  It was 
a group of people who's crime was to be Jews to
 burn and to disappear 
with a nod of the whole 
civilized world.  It's not the same  holocaust a
nd killing.  Any war is horrible, but it was done by 
an intelligent, educated, bright
 people, to take a whole nation 
and say vermin we are going to 
ma ke the earth clear of you and have everyone pa
rticipate.  So, it's a different holocaust.  
Holocaust doesn't only mean kill or murder, andI think that's why the Jewish Holocaust is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340  
66 
 
different.  And it should just ma ke people awar
e that that can happen to any group of people by 
other people.  Then the Jewish holocaust wouldn'
t be unique, theirs woul
d be unique.  It still 
would be unique, but what I'm saying is reme mb er
 hatred does not justify that kind of huma n 
attitude.  And how do we teach pe ople not to hate?   I don't know. 
Q. Thankyou.
