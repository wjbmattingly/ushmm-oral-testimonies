T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hat you are about 
t o  he a rf rom  Mo rri s  i
sone individual's account of the Holocaust.
 
 
W ehave prepareda brief slidepresentation to help with his introduction.
 
 
W ebegin with a portrait of  Morris Rosen whowas born Moniek Rozen, son of Jakub 
Rozen andGolda ChajaWarszawska in 1922.
 
 
Mo rri s  was
 
born in Dabrowa Gornicza in Upper Silesia where hisfather was an 
off icial distributer of tobaccoand acetylene. T he arrow on them apof  Poland points to the 

location of  Dabrowa.
 
 
Here we have a 1924portrait of oneof  Morris' sisters, Rozia Rozen Bilauer, who 
survi ved in the USSRduring the war.
 
 
T hisphotograph isof Morris and hisf riendson a hillside in Dabrowa.  Morris is at the

As you will hear shortly, Morris survi ved sever al Nazi cam ps;then,after a six
-
week 
forcedm arch, he arrived in Buchenwald concentration cam p in Germ any. T he arrow points to 

Buchenwald.
 
 
Eventually, in 1945, Morris was liberatedf rom  theT heresienstadt cam p in occupied 
Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Arm y.
 
This is the train station inT heresienstadt.
 
 
W eclose this brief
 
slide presentation with a photograph of Morris wit h Regina 
Zilberstein after liberation.  Morris cam e tothe UnitedStates in late 1949and,following se ven 

years of art school,built a successf ul contracting business in Baltim ore, where he still lives 

to
day.
 
 
He  is  we ll
-
kno wn as astamp, postcard and letter collector, especially f or his 
Holocaust postal history collection including thosef rom Nazi
-
created ghettos in Poland.  He is 
also recognized worldwide for his collectionon the Olym picsand has traveled and lectured 

about this collection as part of the Olym pic Gam es.  Hehasexhibited at numerous U.S. and

docum ents and correspondencef rom  campsand ghettoes to this Museum .
 
 
Morris speaksf requently about his Holocaustexperience at such places as the 
headquarters of the Social Security Adm inistration, the Centersf orMedicare and Medicaid and 
Fort Meade in Maryland.  He spoke last week to 700 soldiers at theArm y's AberdeenProvi ng 

Grounds, also in Maryland.   Healso speaksto students at num erous Baltimore
-
area schools 
andother locations. He is currently writin g abouthis experience 70years ago attending the 

Nurem burg war crim es trials accom panying his brother
-
in
-
law who was a journalist covering 
the trials.
  
He was theonly Jewish sur vivor of the Holocaust who was a war correspondent at 
those trials.
 
 
Besides his volun
teerwork in this m useum 'sarchives, Morris has beena volunteer 
for the Red Cross HolocaustandW arVictim sT racing and Inf orm ation Center.  He was named 

the Baltimore
-
W ashington, D.C. Manof the Yearf or theAmerican Red Cross.  Morris, who lost 
h is  wif e
 
in 2000, has two sons and two grandchildren.
  
T oday Morri s is accom panied by his 
f riend.
 
 
Finally, I think you will appreciate knowing that Morris works out three tof our times a 
week doing zum ba, which combines Latin and international music wit h danceas
 
an exercise 
program .  He also isdoing anotherform of danceand exercise even more strenuous than 

Zum ba.  He mentioned to m ehe is theonly male ineither class.  His doctor, however, has 

ordered him tono longer go onhis steep roof to clean gutters and
 
do repairs.
 
 
W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Morris Rosen.
 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Thank you.  Good morning. 
 

>>  Goodm orning.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Morris, thank you so muchfor your will ingness to be our First Person today 

and join us.  Youhaveso much to share with us and we have such little time so we'll start.
 
Let'sf irst,before we get to the war years and the Holocaust, tell usa little about you, your 

fam ily, and your community bef ore the war began.
 
>> Mo rri s
 
Rosen: W e lived in upper Silesia.W elived together with the gentile people, 
Christians it didn'tm ake any difference if  youwere Jewish or not Jewish.  I rem em ber that 

ever y Christm as timem y sisters and I was all the tim e invitedf or the Christmas trees, all the 

tim e.W e had good tim es. Cam eour holidays, as Christianf riends, they came to our house, 

joining us atdinners it doesn'tm ake any diff erence. 
 
 
But this stopped in1938 when the Pogrom , which they called the Kristallnacht, 
started in Germ any.  The sam e thing started in Poland, in our city.  Andmy f riends,they were 

thebestf riendsof m inef rom  school, they put onbrown shirts and started to knock out 

windo ws in Jewish stores, the sam e thing what happened inGermany.  So this changed alitt
le  
b it .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Morris, tell usa littlebit about your f ather'sbusiness and what happened to his 

business as Hitler came to power.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Yes.  Not everybody couldhave tobaccoand cigars and cigarettes. W e 

delivered to thearm ies since the FirstW orldW ar which the Russians and Germans were in 

our city. W edelivered cigars, cigarettes, andever ything to the Arm y also.
 
T hen in 1938, when anti
-
Sem itism  started,unfortunately we had to close up our store. T here 
were som e Polish ladies, they tookeverythin g on ourbooks. T hey chased away the people.  

[Speaking Non
-
English Language] that's what they said. Itdidn'thelp. W ehad to close upthe 
business.  It started to get ver y bad.

>> Bill Benson:  You had a largef am ily.  T ellus a
 
little about your motherand siblings.
 
>> Morris Rosen: W ehave a largef am ily.  My sister used to go tothe university.  T hey we re 
ver y m odern, I think.  Bef ore the war, was a little older.  I went to the school.  I was also very 

good in art.  Andthus I thinkm y art helpedme survi ve the war, too. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T om ove to the war itself , you saw the Germ ans soon af ter they invaded.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Oh,yes.  On the third day.
 
>> Bill Benson:  On the thirdday. T ell usabout whathappened when they
 
came in.
 
>> Morris Rosen: W hen they came in, we couldn'tbelieve it.  First it arrived two m otorcycl es 

with m achine guns checking the road. Abouta half
-
hour later the Germ ans started to arrive.  
Like the Polish Arm y,what did they have?  Likef rom  the 
First W orld War, horses and things.  

T hey cam e in with all kinds of machine guns,with artiller y and everyt hing.  You never saw 

such an Arm y what they cam e into Poland.  And they started right awa y.  T hey startedout 

against the Jews.
 
 
F irs t  o f  a ll,  f rom  6
: 00
 
in theevening to 6:00
 
inthem orning anybody walkin g the 
streets would get shot im mediately.  Jews had to give up everything.  They closedupall the 

Jewish stores and they tookover the stores,the Jewish stores.
 
 
T hen came a couple of weeks later th
is came on the end of  39, they demanded f rom  
the Jews so m uch andso much gold, som uch silver f or paying f or the occupiedf orces.
 
 
W e were only 5,000 Jews in our city.  T hat's all.  People were very p oor. T hey didn't 
have
 
--
 
they had to give up their gold rings, wedding rings.  They had tobuy some goldpieces 
because everybody has to donate. W e gave it to them . Next tim e, two weeks late he still not 

enough. T hat's what happened.
 
 
T hen it started to be very bad.  Cam e theorder. W e got to wear arm bands on the 
left side with the Star of  David.  Then they changed this in 1940 becausethey incorporated 

Silesia and the same thing to the Germ an right thatm eans we belong to the Polish 

governm ent, what it was, but the German Reich.  So we have to wear the s
am e
 
--
 
like the 
Germ ans, the Star of  David.
 
In the back of the pants and the back of m y jacketand the arm band also.  It started 
to get very bad.
 
 
First of all, they started to catchpeople.W hen he they needed something cleaned, 
snow, anything, they called right away, elder Jews, younger Jews.  T his was not the worst.
 
I have to skip a lotbecause you can'tdoeverything in it onehour.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One thing notto skip, tell usabout your sister whoescaped to Russia. 
 
>> Morris Rosen:  That's what I was going to say.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e're being telepathic here. Ok.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  One sister
 
--
 
80% was Jews there.  She came hom eto ourf ather,mother, 
saying goodbye, I saw enough.
 
 
W hat happened, they startedtoburnthe synagogue. T he rabbis wi th the sons 
startedto go into the fire to rescuethe holy scriptures. T hey pushedthem  into thef ire.  And 

Jews, all the way on the outside watching how the synagogue burns, they startedm achine 

gunning everyone.
 
 
T here was a lot of  Jewish hom es. T hey started shutting up the doors saying they all 
should com eout. T hey killed them .
 
 
In Israel, I talk about whathappenedat that tim e. T here was one guy that actually 
lived through this.W hat happened was a priest there inthe church,
 
he told thepeople jump 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

the window, they should run. He rescueda lot of  Jewish people there.
 
 
So one guy was shot there buthem anagedand ran also to the church there.  He 
was saved.  Infact inIsrael, he pictured up his arm . He said if  he wouldhave
 
noticed blood, 
he would have been killed.  T his way the priest got it right away, doctored himup. He had the 
bullethole, whathappened.  It was terrible.
 
 
T hen whathappenedalso was also in 1940. T hey went on the streets. T he police 
took everybody's
 
ID ca rd.  You com e tom orrow 11:00
 
at them arketand get it back. W edidn't 
know what happened.
 
 
W ecame there. Thewhole city was there, Jews and non
-
Jews.  They brought 10 
people, hooded. W edidn't see theirf aces, on a truck.  Infact, [Speaking Non
-
E n glis h  
Language], I gotm orefood and things. T heyshouldn't catchm eto sendto Germany. W e 

helped put up the scaffold.  I wasn't a Carpenter butI helped.  I was a brick layer.  Everythi ng 

there. Justto get some morefood. W ebuiltthe scaff old. T his was10 Pols that they tookout 

f rom  the city that they did sabotage.  It'snot true. T hey didn'tdonosabotage. T hey just city 

by city in Poland took peoplef or sabotage toscare the people. T hat's wh y they were 

successf ul justfor thebrutality thateverybody was af raid. T hat's what it was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfirst forced labor,as you said,brick layer.  You had tom ake the scaffold.  

Bef ore long you were forced to becom ea painter. That was important to your survi val and 

also it was ver y im portant to the rest of your life. Tell us how that startedand what happened.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  It startedbecause youdidn't getfoodenough. Believe m e, if you didn't 

have m oney tobuy onthe blackm arket, youwere starvin g.  You had only 600
 
calories a
 
d a y:   
Can you live on 600
 
calories?  Forget it. Nobody can.
 
 
So anyway, I was a painter.  I becam ea painter.  Abrick layer.  I didall kinds of 
work to get some more food.
 
 
W hat happened, in our city, the Jewish community, thepeoplef rom the Jewish 
co
mm unity, they have to deliver peopleto work whatever they want, 200, 300people. And 
then they took those people away. W e didn't know where.  Then wef ound out that they sent 

them  to Auschwitz.  No t to help people.  T hey don't have people free. 
 
 
I  c a me
 
there.  I worked in the cam p.  Only 60youngsters in the leatherf actory.  
Soon when they tookm y parents away.  It happened
 
--
 
I will never forget
 
--
 
August
 
1,  19 42 .
 
First of all, bef ore that cam e the order that the Jewish comm unity, all the Jewish girls
 
f rom 12 
years to 25have to register. T hey can't be working in thetailor shop in our city which 

wa s
 
--
 
you have to buy your own m achine inorder to join this. T hey were m ore safe not to 
send to Germany.
 
 
Soon, the girls cam e over there, 450 girls f rom  our city.  That'sall the youngsters 
that was there. They grabbed them right away and said give them for a job. T hey took them  

to a concentration camp.  Andm y father went thereand tried to getout. Itdidn't help. T hey 

took them  away. W edidn't know
 
where andwhat and when.
 
 
Com ing hom e, it was like in thehouse like ataf uneral. A 12
-
year
-
old, m y youngest 
sister, is not here anym ore.  It was terribleat hom e. I couldn't seem y m other crying ever y day.
 
T wo weeks later we received thef irstpostcard that she works in a slave labor cam p in Lower 

Silesia and that she works at them achine, working f orth andback,but give her regards to 

Zilberstein. W hatdoes it mean? T hese werethe two Jewish bakersin our city.  So it means 

she's hungry, she needs bread. It was allowed to sendat thattim eone kilos som ethingf ood.  

Som y m other on the black m arket we bought somef lour, she baked something.
 
 
I had a specialperm it because I worked only for all the top officialsfrom  the

Ge rm an s at tha t tim e . S o  I 
could go with m y ID to the postoff ice, deliver the package, and 
walk outside the ghetto.  W ithm y ID I could walk. 
 
 
Here was responsiblefor all the Jews to sendto Auschwitz in all Silesia, 35 
countries.  I workedfor himat thattime whenthey tookm y parents awa y.
 
W hat happened in42,the Jewish com munity told us put on Sabbath clothing, look presentable 

and to be there at 5:00
 
in the morning.  Kids, newborn, everybody has tobethere near the 
Jewish com munity. W e were thereat5:00
 
in the m orning unt
il 8:00. In if August it's so hot.  
People are crying, nowater, the babies were cryin g, no water or anything.
 
Finally, by 8:30, I said something is not kosher, something sm ells terrible. W hen I 
saw SS with m achineguns all across thef ield.  Andarrived
 
three trucks of  soldiers. Andwho 
was there? Ludwig, the one that sent everyb ody to labor cam ps,the one who sent to 

Auschwitz and so on. They m ade the selections. This was f irst selection. T hey put up three 

tables.  And theheadof  thefam ily has to
 
bewith the rest of the family.
 
 
W ell, theone that had IDs like I had,I worked for the Germ ans, we were in the 
center. Boys and girls thatdidn't have IDbutstill were able to work, they putthem  to the left 

side. T he other side, elder people.  You could be the late30s, 40s, and over. T o the other 

side.  Andthism eans it was a selection.  Nota single elderpersonwas lef t in our city. T hey 

took them  away, right away, on footto thenext cit y, Belgium , which was aboutfourm iles. So 

they chased t
hem  f our m iles.
 
 
I didn't have the keys to ourhom eto get in.  I knew where they were  in the 
orphanage. I cam ethere. T he Jewish police were watching, not Germ ans.  No, you can'tgo 

up. I said, Idon't have m y key.  It was a Jewish policem anf rom ourc
ity.  
I knew him  very well.  
I sa id , 
I just wantthe keys.  I can't get in thehouse.  I slept outsideall night long.
  
Only f or f ive 
m inutes. 
 
 
I went in there. I should never see apicture like I saw this picture in my life. People 
were so cryin g they knew what was going to happen.  My f ather gave me the keys.  My m other 

said, don'tforget would not senda 12
-
year
-
old toa cam p.  And three days later
 
--
 
I worked at 
the tim efor thehead off icer who senttoAuschwit z.  I told them  aboutm y parents.  I wo
rk  f o r 

you.  Don't worry.  I f ind them .  Like you did. Like he did.
 
 
T hree days later I saw a train,passenger train.  And one was wavin g like this. I 
recognized af atherf rom  m y bestf riend. As Iwa ved back I hear shots.  Under roof, near the 

doors.  S
oI jum ped into a ravine and stood there until the trainpassed. Then I was af raid to 
go in the m iddleof  the city, to go hom e,but Iwent through the woods, a longer wa y.  I was 

scared. 
 
 
W hat happened?W edidn'teven have tim e to cry about whatthey took away, my 
parents.  I hadf rom  the Jewish comm unity
 
--
 
f irst of all tom ove tothe ghetto.  Nine peoplein 
one room . T he poorest place in our city.  Nofloors.  Nonothing.  Soit was nine girls and 

seven boys.
 
 
So we got tom ake on the f loors so the girls can sleep. Them en, we slept on the 
outside. W edidn't have anywhere to sitdown. W e stoodthe whole tim e.
 
 
Four days later I get an invitationf rom the Jewish com m unity.  They gave me tickets 
on the train. They gave me som ef ood, sandwiches and you go to a camp. So I went on the 

train.  It was thef irst cam p. T here was a leatherf actory there. Theleatherf actory we wor ked 

eight hours.  And we got foodf rom the Jewish com munity that they sentfood, bread, potatoes 

we cooked up,that kind of food. But I didn't look so bad because there was one lady, shewas 

ver y nice tom e,a Polish wom an.  She knew we don't have m uch to eat.  Every day she

broughtm e something.  So youhave goodPols, bad ones.  You have everything. 
 
I had it good.
 
 
And there was onefam ily which they chased
 
--
 
all the Jews, cleanup Jews.  But he 
was the main engineer at the leatherf actory because he knew how m uch toput in the 

chem icals and everything to becom e leatherfor thefactory.  He was them ain one. So hekept 

h im  t
here.
 
 
I used to go hom e tothe ghetto because Ibrought
 
--
 
for them an, hewas like a 
Germ an.  He was Polish.  He was very bad.  Itook some leather, sold it in the ghetto, and I 

gave him  the money. So that's why I went like every t wo weeks. 
 

 
Later on i
t got very bad.  Nom ore Jews there.  I didn't have anywher e to go.  5:00
 
in  
them orning who com es in?  SS. They tookus away.  Ever ybody.  T ook us away.  There was 

onefam ily, engineerfor them achinesand everything, a young wom an,only 23 years old,wi
th  
a baby 2 years old, she was there,too:  So Ihelped her with thebaby.  Carrying.  But lucky 

m e, when we com e tothe station I gave herback the baby. W hathappened?  A car, a black 

car I remem ber right now, with SS, they were  waiting f or her. T ookher right to the car.  If I was 

still hold the baby, I wouldn'tbeheretoday becauseI would go toAuschwit z, too. T hey sent 

her right away to Auschwitz.  I never forget this.  Such abeautif ul wom an,23 years old. W hat 

can you do? 
 
 
W e came there.  Gave
 
theordernom ore Jews.  We had to clean out the ghetto. So 
we cleanedoutthe ghetto. We gotonly oneslice bread in them orning, soup with no potatoes, 

nothing, but you got to eat. 
 
 
So on the third day com esLudwig. W ho was Ludwig?  He's the one that caught in 
them iddle we see Jewish babies on the truck like this. Terrible what I saw. Westoodat 

attention.  I'm  17 years old. I'm  going to tellhim  I'm  a painter he's going to kill m e.  One guy 

f rom our city, oh,he's a painter.  Come over. He lookm e in theface, in my nose, [S
pe a k i ng 
No n

would 
you keep your dirty m outh shut?
  
You don't answer that you're 
a painter.  
 
 
So I came up to m yself.  He takes outhis pistol.  At m y tem ple.  Hesays I have three 
room stopaint.  If you're notf inished in threedays, you lived enough.  I alm ostf ainted. 
 
I came tom yself . I says, I don'thave no paints, I don'thave no tools.  If  you letm e
 
--
 
no t far, 
has tools, was a painter in the ghetto.  Hetook two SS men. Ihave to walk in the m i
ddle of the 
road because you can't walk as a Jew on thepavem ent. W e went to thepaint store.  I got 

paints, the ladder,andthey helpedm e with som e. W as beautif ul woodenfloors. T hey have to 

put straw not todam age thef loors.
 
 
And who did he have there? He hadthism istress a Polish wom an,tall, beautiful, 
like a movie actress,about 23, 24 years old.He wasn't m uch taller that I am. That's whatthey 

kept. He didn't give me all day long not a glass of  water.  AndI'm  scared to take.
 
 
So what did I
 
do? I was ver y good in school in painting.  [Speaking Non

painter in at the time city. W hen I was 6 years old, we didn't have work to eatbread.  So Ihad 

to go to work. W edidn't go to school. I didn't have no schooling.  Had to work toeatbread. 

And that's why.  And he walked away.  A half
-
hour later, who comes?  Ludwig. W ith abag.  
He says this isf or you, [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language].  Don't get caught.  He's got lif eand 
death.  Don't get caug
h t with  it.
 
 
So he walked out. I opened the bag.  It was a big Salam i.  A whole kilo, m ore than 
two pounds.  Believe m e, it didn't take10m inutes. T hat Salam i, nobody's going to takeaway 

the Salam i f rom  m e.
 
>>  [Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  He says to y
ou
 
--
 
he is, as you said, he's God

like. He decides who lives and 
dies.  He gives you

>> Morris Rosen:  I shouldn't get caught.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Saysdon't get caught with this. 
 
>> Morris Rosen:  SoI kept the whole Salam i.  Nobody's going to take away f rom me. This is 

it.  Bread,how m uch bread.  It's overf our pounds, 2
 
kilos.  I tookapiece. I puta piece on top 
of  papers shouldn't get dirty f or tomorrow.  T he cigar I don't sm oke. So when we went out,I 

gave this to the guys thatdidn'thave anything to eat.  Andthe cigar, I don't sm oke.
 
 
T he next day, again, the sam e thing he brought thefood.  So I knew every day.
 
 
T hen I becam e them aid for hism istress.  I washedthe windows.  I washed thefloor.  
He broughtm e stew, he brought me shella
c
. 
 
And with all the glass I shouldn't getbloody. 
 
Rubbed thef loors and put shella
c
. Lucky didn't smoke. T he 
she
lla c
 
is all alcohol.  Everything 
would go up inf lames. 
 
 
T his wasf our weeks. Af ter four weeks he says, well, I don't send you to Auschwitz, 
which I didn't know wh at Auschwitz m eant but that's where m y parents went.  Butto a slave 

cam p you go. 
 
 
So since he was so good, I stoodat attention.  I told him  I don't have nobodyf rom 
m y whole f am ily.  Is it possible, I only have one sister in a camp, can I go there wherem y 

sister is? W here is she?  [Speaking Non
-
English Language] this isa wom an's camp. Butthen 
he said [Speaking Non
-
English Language], you will be there. 
 
 
W hat happened inthesam e city in Gruenberg was a cam pfor men, about80men 
were there.  He knew this camp where the wom en were there in different barracks.  I landed 

there. 
 
Letm etell you, Ihad plenty food there. W hy?  Every m orning I was a painter there, 
painting.  You got drunk f rom the ether like whena sick personor som ething, they gave ether 

bef ore the war.  And Ipainted them achines. I saw m y sister every day.  Theoff ice wherewe 

hadthe paints, six ladies there.  Young wom en, secretaries.  So one wom an says takeout the 

garbage, clean up, take out the garbage. I took the garbage. That I shouldn't throw ever ything 

away, you have something there.  Itch throw out the garbage.  It was packed.  Nothing apaper 

napkin.  But inanother napkin, a roll with two eggs, with cheese.  Every m orning shebrought 

m ethat.  Right away I cleaned out wherem y sister works and put this in herbasket, that she 

should have thefood. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that Gruenberg, which was a wom an'scam p, was exceptionally 

horrible f or wom en.

>> Morris Rosen:  Forwom en but notfor them en.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about circum stancesfor the women.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  First of all, when I arrived there, right away they m adem e two new suits.  
Can you imagine? Beautif ul suits from nicem aterial. T wo shirts. Because this was a cam p 

and we work togetherwith the Germ ans.  You com b your hair and take showers ever y day.  

T his was the thing because you work with the Germans, we shouldn't look likeprisoner
s.  Bu t 
elegant, clean.  And itwas nice there.  Ihadplenty of food there,believe me. Everything I 

gave to m y sister.
 
 
T hey got beatings. T hey worked 14hours aday, sometimes 12. Som etimes you 
worked the day shift and they say, oh,now you work the 
night shif t, 12:00.  So 16 hours 
without interrupting.  The wom en were starvi ng there. But Ihelpedm y sister.  And Ihad a 

girlf riendf rom m y city t hat I used to go with her.  Ialso gave her plenty of f ood. I hadplenty to 

eat.  I helped m yself .
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  How were you able to getf ood to your sister in those circum stance?
 
>> Morris Rosen:  BecauseI had itpacked. I went to clean them achine, going to paint the 

m achine. And she had the basket there,damages somethings.  SoI threw in thebasket
. 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister I think was ill at the time ora doctor saidshe was ill so you could 

vis it  h e r.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  No. I wantedto seem y sister.  I wantto seem y sister.  In order to the 

sister, you have to go through the doctor.W hich the doctor was in the ladies room . Soevery 

evening he knew that I wanted to see m y sister.  So I walked inevery evening to see the 

doctorbutactually I took along a sandwich, took alongf ood,and I saw m y sister ever y day.  I 

couldn't talk with her. But inthe evening, goand seethe doctor, Italk with her. 
 

 
T here were about400 [Indiscernible]every d ay.  It wasn't bad.
 
 
But onetime, this was about eightm onths later, who comes in?  Ludwi g.  Something 
sm ells.  If Ludwig is here, it's rotten. So we didn't go to work in them orning. W estood atroll 

call.  Ina circle. And he says [Speaking Non
-
English Language], where's m y painter? Didyou 
see your sister? I thanked him . I will never f orget you in m y lif e what you did thatI could see 

m y sist e r.   
I thankedhim for m y sister. 
 
 
He sm iled.  [Speaking Non

English Language].  T he head of  SS f rom  our cam p f rom  
them en, Rozen, come into the room  to m y office, sit down.  He gave m e a bowl of hot soup.  

He gave m e a roll of bread.  Ludwig told him  to treat me nice. 
 
 
But,of  course, it didn't last long.  A week later when Ludwig
 
--
 
we couldn't be 
together with the women inthe cam p.T hey took us
 
a concentration camp o
n  t ru c k s .  I  will 
never forget, February 43. It was terrible cold. T hey took us in the
 
tru ck. W ea rrive  to
 
--
 
hours 
later. T he guards in the brown uniform  with the gun.  Soon we stepup, came over like an 

animal.  A knif e, leather pants, leather jacket,theberet like a Frenchm an. W e shouldf orm  

right awa y a circle.  Collects two m en, throws them  in the center, steps on their throat and kills 

them . That'show you're going to look if youdon't give upanything. 
 

 
T hey didn'tdo anything. W hydid you kill him?  He threw them  to the ground, in the 
m ud, snow, dirty snow.  SoSS,don't you know?  He threw him  down with the gun.  Can you 

im agine? 
 
 
W estood at the roll call for 10hours. W hat happened? It was a new concentration 
cam p. T he clothes were still wet.  No water, anything. W e stoodthere till late in the evening.  

T hen we com eto
 
the room, no windows, no water to wash, a bucket to relieve yourself .

didn'thave no lamps to see.  Ihad a lot of picturesf rom  hom eat that time.  So2:00
 i
n the 
m orning I reason out and 
--
 
run out and I have the metal things f or food.  Near the barrack.  
W rappedaround in paper.  Puton the ground and went back tobed. 
 
 
T hey wake us up in the cam p5:00
 
in them orning.  Stood at the roll call in the 
pajam as. No shirt, no underpants, just apajam a, striped pajama.  And with wooden shoes.  

W ith theberet, that'sall.  And you have a number.  In Gruenberg m y number was 815. 
 

Concentration cam p,19,815. This was m y num ber. T hey didn't call by name but the number. 
 
 
5:00
 
in them orning you have to stoodat the roll call.  Six blocks inour camp. And 
ever y block about800, 900 people in eachblock.  If there was dead people, 
you have to put 

them f orthe roll call right on the ground laying dead, so many dead. 
 
 
Andall the time that guy in thef ront, especially, like this hebeats you.  I was sm art.  
I picked up where tall people arebecause six in a row.  I jum ped right not in thef ront anym ore 

butbehind a tall guy, I shouldn't be seen.  And believem e,I didn't get not once, didn't catch 

not in thef ace, get it or
 
--
 
anything.  I was self ish.  You gottodo it if you want to survive. 
 
But I became a Musselm an.  W hatm ean? All skin and bones. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  A Musselm an.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Right. This is af ter a couple of days or week you m ight be dead. W hy? I 

hadthe worst job that can happen. T hey putm edown ona tank like. T hey didn't have gas.  

So Ihave tofeed wetwood to burn to go with the tank andpick upstumps and everything.
 
First of all, whatever I ate came upf rom  the stumps up anddown.  And the smoke was for 

eight, nine, and10hours thatI couldn'tbreathe no more andI couldn't eat. 
 
 
So what happened,
 
num ber six block came Grossm an.  He sent mesom ef ood. I 
didn't want to accept.  He came. W hatdo you think, you som ething special you won't eat?  

You wil l die.  I said I want to die.  My m iserable life.  You wanttohelp me?
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat was f irst time you actually thought you wanted todie.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Yeah.  I wanted to die.  I couldn't breathe.  If youwant to helpm e,and 

you're able to helpm e.  You know I was a painter, brick layer, Carpenter. Putm e asa painter 

or something else.
  
T wo days later I becamea painter. 
 
 
If it's 50 people or 70 people or 20 people, and we were only three painters have to 
report. The soup was therefor lunch.  Canned soup. If  it go50people had the same am ount 

for three people.  Like we had three people, can soup.
 
 
I seethe guys, I gave away m y f oodf rom the camps. They gi ve out to everybody.  
W hat are youdoing?Are you hungry?  Don't worr y.  You won't be hungry.  You don'tneed the 

fo o d. 
 
 
W e went in. W e come to place. Right away where we had the paints there, right 
away they start baking potatoes. T hen came the boss,a Germ an.  He was so good, so nice.  

T his was Monday m orning.  He brought cake what his wif e bakedf or Sunday.  And he bro
ught 
to give to the painters.  The two painters weren't even painters.  I was only one. 
 
 
So cam e topaint.  I m ixed m y own colors.  I did all in oneday. T hey were angry.  
T his isfor week work and do inone day? Sotheboss came in,he says, oh, you are painter.  

Not like they.  They don't know what they do. Yeah. And he was nice.  Hebroughtfor each 

one something.
 
 
Anddo you know, when the SS cam e,I wentto work with theother two gu ys f rom 
the camp with m achine guns to work.  He took a picture.  He gave me the picture.  I sohe it in

Unfortunately I lostthe picture when we evacuated later on.  So Grossman, he says, 
if  youhave som ething, hidebecause going to takea shower.  Give it to a guy that will stay, 
already took showers.  It's going to be saved.  I gave him m y hatthere.  He gave a lot of  

things.  Hehad money and other things. W edidn't takeno
 
shower all day long.  I went back to 
get m y stuff , the man got shot andI lostall the pictures and everything.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he man who was holding your pictures got shot?
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Yeah.  AndI lostall the pictures, about 200picturesfrom home. This is 

where I had the picture like this. This would be one. I lostthis unf ortunately. W hat can you 

do?
 

>> Bill Benson: T here's so muchthat you have to skip over.  In February
 
1945, of  course, you 
are evacuated f rom the cam p and taken on deat
h marches. T ell usabout that very horrible 
ordeal that you went through.
 
>> Morris Rosen: W ell, what happened, we didn't go to work.  Som ething was happening.  

T he Russians enteredthe Germanproper.The Russian Arm y, theSoviets.  So they started to 

e
vacuate. T he cam p.
 
 
So we didn't go to work.  Take your blankets.  They gave ever ybody a loaf of bread 
with som em armalade, a piece of margarine,and we march.W hoever is sick.  I was af raidto 

be sick because Ithought they probably going to kill ever ybody there, not to be witnesses, 

which is it happened.  But f rom this cam p, it didn't happen. T hey were liberated the next day.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter you left.
 
>>
 
Morris Rosen:  Yeah. That's what Ifoundout. And we were m arching eight hours.  
W hoever was behind,a bullet in thehead. 
 
 
W ecame outf rom  thewoods.  TheGermansretreating.  Sox a Germ an off icer

um .  He has other 
th in gs. 
 
 
He took us through the woods again. W e walk in the woodsfor another eight hours. 
People couldn't walk, a bullet in the head.  My legs swelled up already.  T hey were swollen.
 
 
Finally, the next day we rest up a little bit.  He putus ina barn to sleep. People were 
hungry.  So we ateupall thefood thatthef arm er preparedf orthe anim als, for thepigs and 

cows.  Ever ybody helped themselves.

of  the lice. The wind was how wil ling a way

I went toputonm y pants.  Forget it.  It was a pieceof  ice, like aboard.  So on the

Yeah, sure. T he next two, threedays over 400peoplediedf rom the cold

12
 
intelligent person. Aswe walk on the Death
 
March, who do we see retreating? Hungarian 
soldiers that were SSfor theGermans. T hedoctor recognized oneof  the Hungarian guys.  He 
says, m y God.  Hisfather worked in abakery.  I never charged him for any medical bills, gave 

him  m edicine f ree.  So 
he ran tohim.  You recognize m e? I gave you all thefood.  Give me 

som ething to eat.  He took out, sm ashed open his head. T hatpoorguy, he gave him  all the 

food.  Hepaid him back that he died thefollowin g day.  He was bleedingf rom the head. No 

m edi
cine.  No nothing. Poor guy.  Ifelt so sorry
 
--
 
I wi ll never f orget this.
 
 
Finally, we entered Buchenwald.  Upa steephill.  And that Lageraeltesten.  He was 
in num ber two in the 30s.  Can you imagine? So walk like soldiers. He started yelling, one, 

t
wo, three, stop.  Hit everybody over the head.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Addsyou're m arching.
 
>> Morris Rosen: W eshould walk like soldiers. W hen we cam e tothe gatesfrom  

Buchenwald, was out there, who was there? Germ ans. Butthere were com munists.
  
T hey 
we r e
 
in cam p. W hen they saw what happened, they grabbedhim  right away, threw him tothe 
ground.  He had thebeating.  He was bleeding f rom  all over the place.  And steponhim aswe 

walked in.  I said, now we are going to kill him.  But environm ents smart
 
--
 
he was smart 
enough. W hat happened?  He had leather pants andeverything.  H e just run away.  He took 

unif orm sf rom  thedead person, threw awa y his everything, probably m oney and everything 

what he had, and he put on the unif orm  andwe didn't see him.  O
therwise we would have 
killed him  there. 
 

 
AndBuchenwald, the sm ell was unbelievable. W hat sm ells so bad? I lookaround. 
Mountains, eight m ountains, about 10
 
feet high.  Iall the time curious, was all the tim e curious, 
politician, whenthe war broke out in Spain, Ifollowed all thetim e, everything when, when the 

Germ ans went to Czechoslovakia.  If ollowedall politics all the tim e. So I went to see whatit 

is .  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he mountains.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  These mountains. T herewas one guy that
 
he was a German. He they 
chased him  out because his grandfather was Polish. They m ovedhim  toour city.  Iplayed 

with him  in the Maccabiah, ping
-
pong.  Used to ride bikes.  Oneeye open, oneon the 
m ountain.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hese are m ountains of human beings.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Hum an beings.  He's up there. I never forget his face.  He was planting 

beautif ul plants for the Germ ans.  So he got food.
 
 
But on the Death March, he didn't have toeat. T hey are theones that died right 
away.  T he HungarianJews cam e to the camp.  T hey were healthy guys, good
-
looking, 
ever ything.  They didn't have anything.  They hadplenty off ood. They died likef lies in the 

cam p. W e were used to hunger. W e could live on one piece of bread aday.  T hey couldn't.  

Because
 
they were still  used to everything.  It was unbelievable. And som any deaths were 
there. Unbelievable. They died likef lies in Buchenwald.
 
 
T hen two days later we have thenews, oh,here. T hey started yelling " Jews out."   
On ly th e  Je ws.  No ta rtists. 
 
I'm not going.  I know the m ountains are here. So I saw some 
guys running in to the back. The wall was there, hollow:  So I run in there, too. And the other 

Jews were transported out f rom there. I sat there an hour. They noticed some other guys.  

T he
 
SS started tom achine gun the wall.  I managedto jump out not to them  but to the back.  I 
knock out the window.  I bloodied m yself .  From  the back, jumped into the group that was sent 

to be evacuated. T his was the last groupf rom  Buchenwald getting out on thetransport. If I

would have rem ained till the next m orning, Buchenwald was liberated. 
 
 
Instead they took usagain to go to the train. People didn't have shoes, wooden 
shoesor nothing.  You didn't seenot ahouse. T here was nota
 
--
 
they loaded u
s up on trains.  
In the train 120 peoplein open one. W e didn't have place to sit down but stabbing and riding 
on
 
--
 
standing and riding on the train.
 
 
Af terf ive days, nof ood, no water,people started dying.  So we threw outthe dead 
bodies.  So then we have place to sit down, sleep.  I laid down there.  It was very cold.  So I 

put some dead bodiesinstead of pillow.  You didn't thinkat thattime.  You
 
were like ananim al.  
You wanted to survive.   I slept on dead bodies. 
 

 
Nine days, no water, no f ood.W e cam etoastation. W e see Soviet planes.  Only 
two of them . Every f ive m inutes they cam eandm achine gunned the locom otive to disable the 

tra in .  B
ecause they saw the prisoners. They can see it. But on theotherend was soldiers.  
T hey started shooting with the guns. Every f ive m inutes. T hey disabled the locom otives.
 
 
Again, don'tforget, nine days no water, nonothing.  Sof inally they started w
a lk in g.   
T o go out.  So they cam e one guy.  I will neverf orget.  Only 12 years old.  He says, Morris, 

I 'm
 
--
 
com e, they won't know you're Jewish.  You wil l survi ve.  I said they will ki ll you.  I said, 
no. Sofar I'm  lucky.  I'm  alive.  I'm  going to see what happen.
 
 
W hat Ifoundout, later, theGerman Nazis took all the Pols into woods thereand

>> Morris Rosen:  Oh,yes.  How m uch tim e?
 
>> Bill Benson:  About seven m inutes.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  That's all?  Ok.  I gotto skip. 
 
 
Anyway, we used to walk there.  Notrain to go. T hef irst water there, they gave us a 
little water to drinkaf ter nine days. 
 

 
F in a lly,  f in a lly,  w
e arri ved 
in Theresienstadt.  Why Theresienstadt?  Because
 
--
 
what 
happened,they had the m ind to get thepeoplef rom  the deathm arches shouldnot be a single 

witness and to be there.  But what happened, when we arri ved, we arrived about10:00
 
a t 
night, cold, hungry. We couldn't go to sleepanything.  It was cobblestone.  W e laid on 

cobblestone.  The lice crawl i
ng, ever ything.  T hey gave us a hot soup with a big piece of 
bread. T his was good. 
 

 
T he next m orning they tookour clothing away.   They burned the clothing because of 
lice.  And they putm e into the[Indiscernible]with aboutat that timeabout 20 people
.   I d on't

I jum ped out the window.  I lay there unconscious.  Idon't know if  a day or two or m ore.
 
 
T he only thing I knew, I heard like a songf rom  the Czech still inm y m ind.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Czech partisan song.
 
>> Morris Rosen:  Yeah.  Andthen they put
 
--
 
I think they woke m e up.  Oh, the war's over.  A 
Soviet off icer with a Czech partisan. T hey wi pedm e off with water.  They tookm e in backto a 

barrack. T here were so many people,30. W as only 12. T hat's all. T hey all diedf rom T yphus. 
 
W hat happened, theone guy, hem ust havebeen a kapo, hef ty guys.  Came in there with two

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word.  Butbefore I 
turn back to Morris to close the program , I'm  going to
 
--
 
when he'sf inished two things I want to
 
say.  One is that ourphotographer, Joel, will com e up on the stageandtake a photograph of  
Morris with you as the backdrop. So I'm  going to ask you to standat that point so we can take 

that photograph.
 
 
And secondly, because there was noopportunity, as you could seewe only got just 
a glim pseof  what Morris couldhave shared with usand no opportunity f or you to askhim  

questions. You will stay, ri ght?
 

>> Morris Rosen:  I will  stay for questions.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Morris wil l stay seatedhere. Com eo
n up on the stage af ter we're done.  

Shake his hand, get your picturetaken with him , say hi,ask him  a question.  Pleasefeelf ree to 

do that when we're done.
 
 
Morris will gi ve his last words f or today, thenwe'll do that. Onthat note, I'll turn to 
Mo rr
is to close our program .
 
>> Morris Rosen: W ell, I like to close one thing.  You have m y story.  If  you hear different, 

that's whathappened.  You can't be indifferent when you see that som ebody is killing you, 

other things, don'tbe silent. W eall got children. If  you black, yellow, or white, or what you are, 

we all got children. W e have the right to live together in peace.  If  we would all live in peace, 

there wouldbeno wars, no killing.  You can see what was going, in other placesnow, the 

Middle East now, unbelievable.  You thefuture generations. You are the ones that can guard 

us. T here shouldbepeace.  And believe m e, Godbless the UnitedStates of America, the 

best country in the world.  I suff ered a lot. I know at what it is.  Believe me, you don't see the 

countries, the whole world like the United States.  Godbless America.  AndGodbless you.
