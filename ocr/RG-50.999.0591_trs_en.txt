T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hatyou are

[Applause]
 
Ir
ene,thank youfor joining us and your willin gness tobeour 
F i rs t Pe rs o n
. W e have 
such a shorttime with you and som uchf or you to share.W e'll startright away, if  you 
don'tm ind. Youdescribed form e thetim ef or you and your fam ily in Czechoslovakia 
b
ef oreW orldW ar IIand before the Holocaust as atim e of hard work , but alsoa good 
lif e, one in which you said there was a senseof  safety. Before we turn to the war years, 
tell us about yourf am ily, your lif e in those years bef ore the war began. 
 
>> I r e n
eW eiss: W ell,we were a fam ily of  six children, lived with our parents, whose 
m ainfocus in lif e was their children. My m other was ver y attentive and hovering, 

because inthose days we didn't have them edicines and theprevention thingsf or 

children. So 
they were exceptionally worr ied about ourhealth. 
 
 
My f ather wentto work every day. M y m otherworked, all I remember about her is 
workin g f rom  morning till night, all themany chores.And the children went to school. 

W eplayed and we celebrated holidays and loved the different seasons. It was af arm ing 
town, so there was a chance to watch thingsgro w, watch thef arm ers harvest, all those 
things, which were just normal in thetown. So it was just a very happy, normal 

childhood. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your siblings. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: T here were three boys and three girls. T he oldest girl was Serena; she 

was 17 at thetim e. I had a brother who was 16. It was a smallf arm ing town, and school 

ended,public school ended at sixth grade. So m y parents, in
 
addition to worr ying about 
our healthand our welfare, they were ver y co ncerned about our education. Soas each 

of  us reached the sixth grade and beyond, we were sent off to the city, to other places, 

to relatives, to live, wh ere we can continueour educa
tion . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e, Irene,at that time, you really didn't sense anti
-
S e m it ism  at  
that tim e before the war. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Not in this small town, where people knew m y f ather and grandfather, 

andm y m other.It was just a very f riendly relationship between the wom en andthe men, 

and the children. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  By the tim e Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, launching 

W orldW ar II, your comm unity had already experienced profound change. Hungary was 

an ally of  Nazi Germ any, and earlier in 1939 your com munity had been occupied by the 

Hungarians, which imm ediately changed your lives.W hathappened once you were 

under Hungarian rule? 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  During the Czechoslovakia regim e, they were ver y democratically 
inclined. There was 
no distinction between citizens. But the Hungarian regim e, because 
they joined Hitler's war plans, I suppose they decided tof ollow Hitler's rules in regard to 
that. So their laws wer e made, and carried out against Jewish citize ns, depriving them  

of  t he i r  
civil ri ghts and theirf reedom . So we began tof eel the isolation andbeing treated 

differently, andnotbeing protectedby the laws. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think, during that tim e, yourfather lost hisbusiness. 
 

4 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  He soon lost his business. He remained at home, doing chores in the 
household, not having an incomef or six children. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat tim e, of course, you couldn't continue your schooling, unless you 

went som ewhereelse.So you went to schoolelsewhere, right? 
 
>> Irene W ei
ss:  I didgo, by that tim e, into acity school, in a nearby city.W e were 
m ade to wear a yellow star onour clothestobetter identif y us as being different. 
Basically, acting as a target for hoodlum sand discrim inationagainst us.So I had 
to
 
--
 
then the
 
law alsocam e out that Jewish children couldnot gotopublic schools.So I 
stopped going to school. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatgrade would you havebeen? 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Sixth grade, som ething likeseventh grade. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the end of your 
education? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: T hatwas the end at thatpoint. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem em ber and described tom ea really f rightening experience you 

had with yourf ather on a train.W ill you tellus about that? 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.The discrim ination was increasing, and soon it extended to all 
kinds of ordinary events, suchas riding a train, on the train. I was com ing homef rom  
another town with m y f ather,only aboutaf ive
-
m inute train ride, and m y fatherhad a 
sm all beardat the tim e, ver y com monthatm en have today. In those days, m ostly 

Jewish, m arriedm en had beards. 
 
 
In the train, abunchof young adults, young teenage types, gatheredaroundmy 
father, laughing and joking, m aking rem arks,such as,W hat shouldwe do with him ? Do 

you think itm ight be
 
agood idea to throw him off? All the while, they were laughing and 
m akingf un of the whole situation. 
 
Nobody in the train spoke up or come to hisdef ense. I was terrif ied, because I realized 

thathe was outnumbered and their intent was ver y serious. They thought it was a lotof  

fun to do that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  No one was com ing to your aid? 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss:  Noone com ing. Looking outthe window of the train, m yf ather and I 
both realized we're ver y close to a station, toour station,and if  we're lucky, we'll get off  

bef ore thishappens. So that's really what happened,the train stopped and we 
go t off, 

shaken to the core. My father never got on a train again,any public transportation. It 

was sim ply not saf e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1942, Irene, yourfather, along with thousandsof other Jewish m en, 

were f orced by the Hungarians todoforced labor.
 
They were conscripted into a labor 
brigade. T ell us what that m eant for your f amily. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, the youngm en were forced into labor brigades, and he had to 
leave thefam ily. T he comm unication was ver y rare, to hearf rom  him .W hat they were 
m
ade to do was to work at very dangerous jobs, at thef rontline,picking up minesand 
doing the kindof  things that are guaranteedto harm  them  or kill them . So it was really 

slave laborf or them . Plus, being Jewish, they were not allowed to have weapons.T
hey 
were reall y sort of  being on thef ront, butnotable to protectthem selves. 
 

5 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was on thef ront of the Hungarians allied with the Nazis against 
the Russians at thattim e. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes,yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  I wantto repeat som ething you said. One of the kinds of  things they 

would do in labor brigades,use them  as human beings to clear m inef ields. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right. And other very dangerous things. Being treated as if  they were 
soldiers, but disrespected andnot given
 
the kind of protection that other soldiershad. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter about six m onths, if  I rem em ber correctly, your  father did return. 
W hydo you think he was able to returnf rom that? And of course,many died doing that, 

but yourf ather was able to come back. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e were very surprised whe n we heardhe was going to be released 

f rom  this. It seem sthat, at that point, the Hungarian regim e didn't quite decide what they 

wanted to do with all of these menand sudden availability of all this 
fre e  la bo r. B ut it 
seem s what they did was sorted people out.Since he had six children,a largefam ily, it 

seem s atthat point they decided to let him go. But the younger people remained, and 

m ost of  them  did not return. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Asdifficult as lif e was under the Hungarians, as you described a little 
bit of  it, it suddenly turneddram atically andtragicall y worse when the Nazis cam e in and 

invaded Hungary in 1944. T ellus about thatand then what happened to youand your 

fam ily oncethe Germ ans c
am e  i n.  
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, that was another level of  terror.Since we heard on the radio 

relentlessly blam ing the Jewish peoplefor everything im aginable.The lies grew daily, 

andthe threat against us, the Jews. Thepopulation kept hearing all these lies about 

how the Jews were spreading disease, they were disloyal, they were dangerous tothe 

state, they had to be deprived of  their citizenship, relentlessly hammering away at this 

one group who is the cause of all the problems, basedon the war. And the lies grew 

and grew, andtheirfollowing gre w with it. Because, there was noother news, all the 
news was censored heavil y and kept out. 
 
 
So thefollowing gre w, and we were feeling more andm orethreatened and 
isolated. Again,not being protectedby the law, which is a tragic situationtofind yourself  
in. Because, the law stands by and watch the abuse of people, andwhen they get the 

idea that it's OK, it's amazing what people wi ll do to each other. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, you were stripped of all
 
your rights, so you had no rights 
under the circum stances. 
 
 
T ell us, Hungary was a ver y close ally of  Nazi Germ any.W hydid theGerm ans 
com e in, in March of 1944? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, we didn't realize it at the time, but the war was
 
--
 
the Germ ans 
we
re losing the war. The war was alm ost over. T he Hungarian governm ent changed 
their m inds.They felt that they m ight be on the losing end of this war and tried to pull 

outof  thealliance.Then Germ any didn't accept that,actually invaded Hungary. 
 

>> B ill 
Benson:  You rem em ber them marching in, theGermans? 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Oh, Ido remem ber.T here were announcem ents,parades, and people 

waiting f or them onm ajor highwa ys, putting outf lags. It was a celebration. The women 

6 
 
andm en cam e out with jugs of  wine and bread and waitedfor them to com e.They 
clim bed the steeple ofthe church to see them approaching,how far they were f rom 

town. T he ten Jewish fam ilies inm y town didn't know what todo,tocom e out. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T en Jewish f am ilies in your town
? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: T en Jewish f am ilies, about 100 persons.W e saw the celebration. My 

father, if  I rem ember som ewhatof a discussion, if he goes out with the crowd, that's 
dangerous. If hedoesn't go out, that's dangerous. So it was this conflict. But we 
certainly knew that thekind of welcom e that the townspeople were giving them, that we 

were in ver y big trouble. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, very soon af ter, you were forced intoa ghetto. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.After the Hungarians invaded, within aboutthree weeks we were 

pulledoutof our homes, we were taken away, intothe next larger city, where the ghetto 

was set up in abrick factory, and the
 
--
 
they selected all the Jewishfam iliesf rom  the 
neighboring towns, and crowded us intothisplace that was
 
m eantfor m aking bricks and 
notfor housing people. So we had thesefam ilies, wom enand children and pregnant 

wom en and sickpeople, no sanitationf acilities and nof acilitiesforf ood orfor any kind 
of  live a b ilit y.  
 
 
W eset up our little bundles on the 
f loor, in one of  the corners of  this huge f acility. 
You had to step over people to come and go.But basically, there was a terror inthe 
place.There was a sense of trem endous danger.W e no longer even had theprotection 

of  our own hom e.W ewere just oneof  thousandsand regim ented and hounded by all 

kinds of announcem ents daily. Just very, very scared.People who were sick and could 

not sleeponthef loor,and so on, were in great danger and suffering. 
 

 
At thisplace, there was a constant announcem entf or
 
the men to return to certain 
places where they wer e integrated. Mostly, they were
 
--
 
they demandedof  them en to 
gi ve them more of their valuables.W hen we lef t our home, a delegation cam e toour 

house the day bef ore to dem andf rom m yf ather that he give them all them oney and 
valuables. Andhedidhave to give them  whatever he did. But then,in the ghetto they 
continuedtohoundpeople, dem anding more, that, " You must have m ore, you didn't 

gi ve us all." There was a constant pressure of taking away all you
 
own, and thefeeling 
you get f rom that is that you won't beneeding it, according to them . 
 
 
So when they take your fam ily outof  your house, and takepossession of all that 
you own, andthen keep dim inishing the space that you have, and keeptaking away 

m oreof  what you have, it's very, ver y scar y. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  You told m e while you were i n that brickfactory, that ghetto, your head 

was shaved? 
 

>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.One of theannouncementsone day was thatall girls under 16 
should report to this c
ertain place to have their hair cut,or yourf ather will be punished. 
T here was always this extra threatthat if  youdon'tfollow orders, som ebody else in your 
fam ily wi ll be punished. 
 

 
I didn't even tell m y m other. I just went to thisplace.There were other young 
girls. I hadm y hair cut. I had long braids at the time.T henI cam eback to wherem y 

m other was, and she looked at me with sadeyes, but really didn't stop to worry about it 

7 
 
toom uch, because we had other,m ore serious concerns.She gave m e one
 
of her 
kerchief s andI put it on. Now I looked like a little married wom an. Religious wom en 
tendedto cover their hair when they were m arried. So I justblended in with that group. 
 
 
As it turnedout, without m y knowing, or even im agining, this sm all even
t played a 
great role in Auschwitz when I arrived.W ithout a doubt, it gave me thef irst chanceto 

live and not be sent to the gas cham bers with the children. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Having the scarf ? 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss:  Having had the scarf, not having m y hair, which I resem bled likean 
older person. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was the spring of 1944.As you saidearlier, the Germans were 

losing the war. It was late in the war. And yet, this desire by the incom ing Nazis into 

your com munity and your country to roundup, at that late date, all the Jews, and they 

did it with extraordinary eff iciency, in the span of  whatI believe eight weeks, roughly, 

m orethan 400,000 Jews were rounded up, bothf rom the cities andthe countryside and 

sent to Auschwitz. T he three weeks in the Munkacs ghetto, you were sent to Auschwit z. 
 

>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.Well, we had never
 
--
 
we never knew what the next step would 
be, what plans they had f or us, for a huge num ber of  people. But y
es,  wit h in  six we e ks 
af ter theGermansoccupied Hungary, the trains, the cattle cars, were running f rom  

various ghettos where they gathered up the people, the trains were running som ewhere. 

It turnedouttobeAuschwitz, alm ostall of  the Hungarian Jews at
 
this tim e ended up in 
A u sch wit z.   

 
So when we were in this ghetto,then oneday there were announcem ents to get 
your stuff andm ove to the trains, the trains, the long cattle cars,the trains were actually 

inside the ghetto, because this was a brickf actory that they hadtheir railroadf or their 

own purposes. 
 
 
T here was a lot of  shouting, yelling, and pushing and" Hurry! Hurr y! Get inthe 
train quickly."   Ever ybody tried to holdeach other's hands, the children's hands tobe 
sure we endup in thesam e cattle car.It was a lotof pushing, and soonthe car was 
f illed with people. 
 
 
Again, we were sitting on thef loor. After a while, when it was f illed,we heard the 
train lockf rom  theoutside.T his tim e, the terror of  all of us,especially theparents who 

ha
dto worry about their children and what their condition would benext, the fear was so 

great that actually no one spoke. It was just in theair. 
 
 
Alwa ys not knowing where the train is going
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  So you did not know where you went? 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss:  Never knew. Never knew the next step. Except thatwhen you're in 
your own town and there is discrim inationand there isdiscomf ort with prejudice, you're 
still in your house.T hen when you're in the ghetto, you realize youno longer are in 
f
am iliar places. You'restrangers, and thefear m ounts.T hen when you're inthe train 
and you're going off toan unknown place, you're leaving your town, you're leaving your 

lif e . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Everyt hing you've known. 
 

8 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Everything you've known. And again, no idea where you're going. 
Puttingm yself  in m y parents'position now, and allparents who donot know what will 

happentotheir children, and that they will not beabletoprotect them , is an 

unbelievable experience. 
 
 
T he train moved
 
eventually, and what peoplewere thinking and what little they 
knew was that in Poland, which was occupied by Germ any m uchbefore, we heard that 
the Nazis carried outm urders and atrocitiesto the Jews in Poland,andthat basically 
they would m archthem  into theforest and gun them  down, everyb ody in thefam ily. 

T here were m ass graves there. 
 
 
W eheard som eof  this from afew escapees.W ealways f elt that it couldn't be 
true, andthese peoplewere exaggerating. But now, when trains startedm oving andm y 

fa
ther looked outand told everyone that the train was wheeling towa rds Poland,that 
was reall y thef irst tim e that total despair descended on everyone in the cattle car. 

Because, going there, now we rem em beredwhat we had heard,the rumors we had 

heard. Itoccurredtoever yone that that will be ourfate. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T henyou came tothis place, Auschwitz.W e saw that extraordinary 
photographearlier, of you af ter you gotoff  the trainat Auschwitz. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes.So when eventually the train st
opped, and again, m y f ather 
looked out that sm all window on the topof  the cattle car, he announced to everyone that 
he sees barracks, andhe sees prisoners in striped unif orm s, andhesees barbed wires, 

but lots of barracks. He feltthis was a work cam p, som e kindof  a labor cam p, and that it 

would not be theforest in Poland. 
 
 
Ever ybody actually, all theadults, the grown
-
ups were saying,W ell, we can work, 
and if it's work, it's notas terrible as they anticipated. 
 
 
So then when the doors opened and there was again the scream ingand yelling 
to, Get out, get out, leave ever ything behind, just to get out very f ast and leave 

e ve r yth in g, ju st lo tsof sh o u tin g, " Out! Fa st, fast!"
 
 
Som y m other told usall to puton some more layers of  clothes,that's all tha
t  we  
wi ll have. I rem emberwe all put on extra clothes. And I hada big coat.I put thaton. My 

head was covered with the kerchief . Leaving ever ything behind is, again, thef ear and 

tension mounts at every step when they strip of  all things, including ide
ntity papers. So 

now you don'texist, and no one is asking your name or who you belong to. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So now, all you have atthatm om ent are the clothes that areon you. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right, right. Andthen the shouting and orders were ver y harsh and 

ver y scar y, and we kept hearing wom en and children to one side, the m en to another 

side.T hishappened within seconds. So themen lined up on one side, and the women 

and childrenand elderly women to the other side on the platf orm . 
 
 
Even as we jum pedout of  this cattle car, these prisoners in striped uniform s 
jum ped into the cattle cars and dum pedall our belongings ontotheplatform.W e saw 

trucks onthe platform where they were loading our stuff into it.So this, in thedays and 

incomprehension as
 
to what is happening to us, we did realize thatwe're being stripped 
of  all identity and all ofour past. 
 

9 
 
 
As the very lar ge group of  womenand children were m oving up the platform, we 
did not see thef rontof it. As we became the ones inthef ront we wer e met by about a 
dozen Nazi soldiers blocking the way. One of them  was motioning people to goto one 

side or theother. 
 
 
W ithin seconds,m y fam ily was torn apart. My f ather and 16
-
year
-
old brother 
were already lined up, with the men to theone side, and m y m otherwith t wo little kids, 
two little boys, was im m ediately taken away and sent toone side.My sister, 17
-
year
-
old 
sister Serena, was imm ediately sentto theother side. So I was lef tholding my 
12
-
year
-
old sister's hand, Edit. And, as things were proceeding very f ast,I was 
separatedf rom her,and she was sent towards where m y m other went and I towards 

where m y older sisterwent. 
 

 
I stopped. Ididn't move. Ididn't go whereI was supposed to go.T he picture 
taken by Nazi soldiers at thatm om ent. 
 
>
> Bill Benson: T he one we saw earlier? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: T he one we saw. Unaware, I had no idea pictureswere taken.ButI 

stand there, andI did notm ove and go whereI was told, because bythattime my 
m other andtwo little boys hadm oved away in a very
 
large cro wd, followed them ,m ore 
wom en and children,and I felt that Edit, m y younger sister, wouldnever catch up to her, 
andthat she would belost in this crowd alone.W ould shebeable toknow who she is, 

and who she belongs to, and would she evercat
ch up? 
 
 
I justfelt that this was them osttraum aticthing that Iexperienced up to then, 
because if  what wef igured, what we kindof assumedby civi li zed assum ption, anyway, 

that if they're separating m enand then they're separating wom enand children an
d 
young adults, it is a work cam p, and that we wi ll be m eeting each other periodically af ter 

wo r k .  
 
 
So it was most important that the women,that m y m other andall herchildren, 
would be together with her. Andthis is whatwent throughm y m indver y quickl
y, th a t I 
couldnot just leave and leave her in sortof  anom an's land. So eventually, I was 

m otioned to go towards where Serena went,with the young adults,andI had to run 

af ter her to catch up and I kept thinking, yes, that'sexactly how it is with my
 
younger 
sister, but am uch larger crowd. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  She's trying to catch up to your m other? 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss: T rying to catch up, but shewon't. I had to run, and yelling, yelling af ter 
Serena to wait for m e. She turned around, and when I caught up toher, she says,W hy 

didn't you go with mom? I just kept repeating that Edit will be alone, she won't
 
f i nd  m om ,  
I don't know why he took heraway f rom m e, I don't know why I didn't go with m om . 
 
 
I was just so conf used and so traumatized that basically, she was the one who 
was alone and that was notpossible to tolerate. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now it's you and
 
Serena,and you don't know wher e everybody else 
has gone at that point.W hat happened to you and Serenaat that time? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, we were
 
--
 
we ended up in a processing place where we were, 
you know, all our clothes were taken away, all hair and body hair was shaved, 

disinf ected.Then give n the prison clothes, you know, one sizef itsall. 
 

10
 
 
 
T hen we were m arched off into barracks. Inthem eantime,m y particular trauma 
continued with the separation, that eventhough I was desperate when I realize
d  th at m y 
younger sister was goi ng to be alone,all of asudden, it occurred tom e very 

dramatically that I too was alone, andI was beginning to panic. 
 
 
So what happened inthe processing place was that they didn'thave to cutm y 
hair. I skipped that stage, and m y sister didn't. So when I was finished and dressed in 
m y new prison dress,I was pushed out the door with other women,andthey were 
beginning to count them  off andtaking themdeeper into Auschwitz,  into thebarracks. 
 
 
I wouldn't leave,because
 
I hadto waitf or Serena. But I was being countedoff  
andbacking off andbacking off. In addition to that, Ibeganto see that even when she 

com es out, I will not recognize her, becauseall these young wom en who came out 

f inished like that looked alike.So I kept proceeding to the door. Every tim e the door 

opened, I kept calling her, "Serena!Serena!"
 
Nobody answered.I realized I am in desperate trouble now. I was cr ying; I was calling 

her name, trying not to be counted off. 
 
 
So a woman, a youngwom an f rom  our town,whom  I knew ver y well , she came 
out thedoor, and she recognized m e. She heard who I called and recognized me.She 

said to me," OK,"  shesaid, "Serena is still.There I saw her. I will stay with you, if I can, 

and wait until she comes out and
 
help you recognize her."  That's whathappened. 
 
 
So Ieventually did. But you know, thetraum aof  that separation, it'swith me 
today, andevery day. I t's a kind of traum athat I guess when yourfamily is torn apart 

andnoone tells you you'll ever see them  again, very hostile situation. T hat was the 

arrival in Auschwitz. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Irene, there's so muchthat you won't be able to get to today with us 

because of the tim e, but there are som ethings that I know you want to talk about, I'd 

like you to talk about. You did encounter otherf am ily m em bers, your two aunts. T ell us 

about that. Because they became absolutely essential to your survival. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W hen we were f inally in thebarracks, quiteby accident my mother's 

two sisters, who cam efrom a nearby town the day before, just by chance, we ran into 

them , of thousands of people. But they were two young wom en, in their m id 20s,m y 

aunt Roseand Pearl. I was just 13 years oldat the time.T o me, they were like adults 

and like m y m other's gene
ration. 
 
 
For m etof ind them  was as if  Ihadf ound m yparents,m y m other.They were just 
protective and wonderful tom eand to Serena. 
 

 
For m e, I was sof rightened by all that happenedbefore. I was so in a state of  
anxiety and traum a that justm eeting them and have them  to protectm e. Of  course,they 

couldonly protectm eup to a certainpoint. But to have them  to hold onto and comfort 
m eand soon,I think that I really did survi ve em otionally and evenphysicall y because 
of  their kindness andtheir love
 
and their protection, and that someonef rom m y fam ily 
thatI belongedtoand they belonged tome and I was not am ongst strangers. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  As you saidearlier, thefact that youhad had your head shaved earlier 

while wearing the kerchief m ade you
 
look older, and that is probably wh y you were 
selected to go with Serena. But once you were in Auschwitz with your aunts, they took 

11
 
 
steps tom ake sure, because you were in constant risk of being selectedfor the gas 
chambers after that. So you told me things like they would try to m ake sure you were in 

them iddle where youcouldn't be seen, when doing lineups, right? 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e soon realized that having, well, the people that we met there, who 

cam e beforeus, whenwe asked them, you know, when do
 
we m eetwith our fam ilies, 
andthey pointed tothe chimneys belching smoke andf ire.T hey said, Look at the 
chim neys. T hat's where your fam ily is. 
 
 
W ethought what didthey do topeoplehere, that they m ake up such stories? We 
totally dism issed this for days and days. Buteventually, it became hard to resist.W e 

saw too much.W eheard too much. 
 
 
So what we then were told, that the wom en and children,upon arrivi ng andbeing 
selected on the platf orm , were imm ediately m arched to gas chambers and killed wit
hin 
thehour,asfast as the process would take. 
 
 
So I realized, we all did, that I sortof  skipped that selection,but I was still terribly 
vulnerable, because they selectedevery day beyond just the platf orm . So every day at 

dawn, we were lined up to be
 
counted, and linedup in rows off ive, and we stoodthere 
for hours, waiting f or the Germ an delegation to com eand lookdown the rows off ive 

and count,andalsopull out theones that were m issed at the platf orm . 
 
 
So I was vulnerableevery day, because hereI was now stripped ofm y clothes 
andm y scarf  and all that, andI just looked like a little girl. So m y two auntsand others, 

m y sister and others making thef ive inthe lineup, positionedm ehopef ully in a way that 

I would not attract asm uch attention.SoI wouldnever be the f irstone, and I would 

never be the last one, som ewhere in them iddle.T hey would hope that I didn't catch the 

eye. 
 
 
But every m orning was a f rightening thing, becauseI saw other young girls pulled 
out,and also peoplethey determ ined were not strong enoughor good enoughfor slave 

labor. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or if  they becam e ill? 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yeah. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint, you were told or got word about yourf ather. W ould you 

share that with us? 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss: W ell,af ter af ew weeks in this sort of holding camp, they began to 
sendpeopleoff , counting people off and sending them out of Auschwit z f or slave labor, 

various war work and other kind of labor.W e, m y two aunts, heard that they're select
i n g 
a thousand women tobe transf erred toa cam p within Auschwitz th at sounded like 

som ething, rum or had it, it was a good assignm ent. I mean, rum orswere f lying. Nobody 

knew anything really. 
 
 
So they decided to line up for thisnew work a ssignm ent.W e we
re ,  all f ive  
of
 
--
 
f ourof  us, we wer e thenassigned to work, which turned out tobe adjacent to gas 
chambernum ber4.W hich, of course, by thistim e we believedandwe understood what 

was happening in these gas cham bers. 
 

12
 
 
 
W e were to work just an electrifiedf ence separating us from this gas cham ber. 
Our work was to
 
--
 
well , this was the place where all the clothing and belongings that 
cam e out of them any,m any trains
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas dum pedon theplatf orm , you told us. 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss:  Dum ped on the platf orm ,those trucks took them  tothis particular 
place,the stuff thatpeoplebrought.I read astatistic that something like 147 huge cattle 
trains arrived in Auschwit z during som ething like two m onths with the Hungarian Je
wis h  
deportation. So 147huge trains dum ping tremendous amount of belongings, all were 

ta ke n. 
 
 
Also, takento this place, andalso the clothing and belongings thatcame out of 
the gas cham bersf rom the peoplethey had killed. So we were assignedto sort o
ut  all 

th is stuff an d b rin g it f irst in to
 
--
 
outof  the weather, into thebarracks,outof  the rain, and 
then to sort them  out according to categoriesandtake off labelsand get everything 

prepared to be reshipped to Germ any f or theuse of the Germ an popu
la t io n.  
 
 
So this was our assignm ent f orthe eightm onths we spend inAuschwit z, before 
Auschwitz was evacuatedand we were taken outonthe death march. 
 
 
During this tim eof being in this place, also next door toone of the gas chambers, 
one of  m y aunts,
 
we were outdoors a great deal bringing this stuff in, and we could see 
them en across thef ence very clearl y. And attem pted, som e of the brave ones, 

attem ptedtom ove closer and closer to thefence to hope tom ake som e kindof  contact, 

tof ind out who the
 
m en were on theother side. 
 
 
In them eantim e,the guard tower was right above all this, with a soldier and a 
gun. You had to be extremely brave. My aunt, if  shethinkabout it, she really was a 

ver y, very bra ve one, and she caught the eyeof  oneof  them
en. He too, he was 
interested inf inding out aboutfam ily and who was on the other side. So this young m an 

turned out to bef rom  our hom etown. He was actually an 18
-
year
-
old young boy. He was 
workin g there. Hethrough over a note,andm y aunt got it. On it
 
the note informedher 
thatm yf ather hadalso been selected to work in the gas chamber, to pull out thebodies 

andtodoall the gruesom e work that they m ade, theGermansm ade our own people 

do. So thatm yf atherwas assigned to do this work, but that he had already beendead 

because he did notfulfill the job well enough. 
 
 
T hey usedour own people to do this work, and wef oundoutas we worked there 
thatevery three m onths or so they actually kil led thesem en and selected new ones 

c o m i n g of f  t he  t r ain fr
om  various towns and cities, because thesemen could only work 
so long doing this work, and that they neededstronger and eff icientpeople. So m y 

father apparently had been killed evenbefore the threem onths was up. 
 
 
M y 1 6
-
year
-
old brother originally was
 
with him , was notm entioned,and we have 
never been able tof ind anyone who knew anything abouthisf ate orhis whereabouts, 

whether he was therewith m y f ather, was also, or was separated attheplatform and 

never even m ade it into the cam p. So even years af ter, we, thef am ily and m y daughter, 

were putting out search inquiries aboutthe Red Cross andother groups that traced 

survi vors who hadnotbeen accountedfor, trying tof ind out what happenedtohim . 
 
>> Bill Benson: T o this day, you don't know any
thing? 
 

13
 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  No. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, you said after eightm onthsdoing what you were doing at 
Auschwitz, in January of 1945 as the Russians were advancing, you were thenforced 

outof  Auschwitz and takenon what's known as adeathm arch. In the little tim e we have 

left, tell us about that and what happened to your aunt. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  In January, winter, in terrible cold, thousandsof  people who were still 
survi vin g Auschwit z were pushed out on thehighwa y and we were m ade tom arch 
hundr
edsof m iles deeper into Germ any, to avoid being liberated by theapproaching 
Russian Arm y. 
 

 
W e ended up
 
--
 
well, along the way, the tragedy continued,because if  you sat 
down, you were shot. If you leanedon someone, you were shot. And the side of  the 

ro
ad hadm any, m any dead people in the gutters. The rest of us were neverf ed or given 
water. T he cold, it was def initely a deathm arch. 
 
 
By the time we arrived deeper in Germany and they put us into other camps 
furtheraway f rom  theapproaching Arm y, those
 
cam ps were already f illed with people, 
andthe crowding and the circum stances were unbelievable.T he Germ an system broke 
down, asfar asfeeding and such as it was, broke down. 
 
 
Disease broke out.In this particular camp where we endedup,typhoid, typhu
s 
broke out.W e were infected with body lice that carriedtyphus. My aunt Pearl caught 
typhus. She becam ehigh fever, delirious.W ewere helpless. Sheeven became deaf  

f rom  the fever. 
 
 
So in this cam p, and in alm ost all of the cam ps, there was a so
-
c a lled
 
lit t le  
inf irm ary.W hat we learned along the way, that these inf irm aries were not to cure 

anyone,but they would com e regularly andtake the sickpeople togas chamber.So this 

placedidn'thave a gas cham ber, but we puther in this little inf irmary,  and there she at 

least hada bunk to herself. 
 
 
W esoon realized thateven though there was no gas cham ber,theysenta truck 
f rom a concentration camp that did have oneto pickup these people.W e watched the 

truck com eone day and em pty the little inf irmary, including m y auntPearl on the truck, 

andtook heraway, and killed her. So that was
 
--
 
by that tim e,I must say that we were 
so defeated and so weak and sick andhopeless, that our reaction was less
 
--
 
it was a 
little m ore muted than it was upon arrival, when we were separated and we realized 

what was happening.W e were already weak ened and very hopeless. 
 

 
Nevertheless, to know what happened to heralm ost atthe end was another 
tragedy. And in the meantime, they didn'tf eed us,didn't take care of us here
. So  m y 

sister becam e evenmore debilitated than I.She was skin andbones.T he selections 

continued, no matter where the Germans took us.T hey never stopped the selection. 
Because, really, what we reali zed now, theiraim  was genocide, and whichever which 
wa y they could carry it out,that was num berone on their agenda. 
 
So oneday, in a lineup, they picked out Serena. I knew exactly, they pickedoutother 

young gir ls who were in bad physical shape.As soon asthey picked herout, I said," I'm 

her sister." 
 
T hey said,"W ell, you can gotoo."  
 

14
 
 
 
Bothof us were put into a room with the other people who were picked.T he door 
was locked. And we waited for the truck. Because we already knew the system. 
 
 
You know, peopleaskm etoday, Didn't your sister protest,
 
ordid you know what 
you were doing? Yeah, we knew, and I knew, and it was for me the best, the most 
im portantthing todo, because I couldnot im agine being alone. My one aunt dead,the 

otherone also runninga hugefever, lying bur ning up on thef loorf rom  thefever. I knew 
she wouldn't m ake it. I had to
 
--
 
I couldnot. I couldnot im aginebeing alone without 
anyone who belonged to m e. 
 
My sister understood that too.  
 
And so we were locked in this room  all day. At the endof  theday, som ebody pushed 

th e
 
door,and it gave.T o our surprise, ithadbeen som ebody unlocked it.And we looked 
out thedoor and gradually ever ything just, one ata tim e,tried it, went down thehall, 

andnobody stopped.There was nobody.T hesystem  had brokendown so enormously 

th a
t sucha thing was possible. 
 
 
W hen Serena and I went back to ourbarrack,m y aunt, who was lying on the 
f loor there,and the other wom en,they all broke out in saying, Oh, the children cam e 
back. T he children cam e back. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here were virtuall y no otherchildren. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Noother children. Nobody ever called us children,because that was 

ver y dangerous to do.Suddenly, it seem s they were already m ourning us and utterly 

am azedthat we showed up. 
 
 
My aunt Rose, very sick, but she did
 
m ake ituntil the Russian Arm y did com e 
anddid open up the big gate. Butthen, she was so very sick that she couldn't walk out. 

Unfortunately, the Russian soldiers who liberated this camp didn't pay too much 

attention to what was going on there.T hey just looked in, these soldiers, and they left. 

W enever saw them again. 
 
 
W e were lef talone tofendour way, sick andwith no transportationandnohelp. 
T he ones who were strong enough walked out intothe nearby town. T he restof us 

stayed around in the sam
e cam p.W e desperately needed transportation and f ood and 
m edical care to getf rom  here to there,and eventually hom e. Itnever happened. 
 
 
Som any of us who made itup to thatpoint died inthe cam psand on the way 
home,becausethey were too weak to goany further. As we proceeded, mostly onf oot 

through thehighwa ys, one of  the
 
--
 
it wasn't a deathm arch, but itm ight have been.W e 
put our 
--
 
m y sister and I andothers in our group, put all the sick ones into ahospital in 
the town. Every to wn had som e kindof a realhospital. So we put Rose in this and the 

rest of us would wait. Not wait to be cured or anything, but justto rest. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ohave enough strength togo on. 
 
>>
 
IreneW eiss: W eproceededthis way f or hundreds of kilometers,until eventually 
som e buses showed upf rom  Czechoslovakia, and hanging throughthe windows and 

the roof  peoplem obbed thesebuses, hung on.W e endedup inPrague,f inally in a real 

hospital. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, we're towards the endof  our program here. Iwish we had 

another periodof  tim e to spend with you. I'm going to stopf or themom ent.W e're going 

15
 
 
to turn back toIrene to close our program  in a few m om ents. I'd like to ask you to st

Serena, you and youraunt Rosedid survive. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Madeit to the UnitedStates later. I wish we hadthe timefor you to tell 

us about that. But when Irenef inishes, we don't have tim efor questions,unfortun
a te ly, 
pleasef eelf reeto come up on the stageaf terwards. Irene will stay h ere. Com euphere 

and shake herhand,meether, orask her a question if  you have a question you want to

I want to thank all of you for being with us. Rem ind you we will have a

It's our tradition at

Irene says herf inal commentsf or today, ourphotographer, Joel,the one who didall

W ith that, I turn to Irene. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  I alsowant to thank youfor com ing to them useumandto take the time 

to listen tom e andm y story. 
 

 
As you ref lectupon what happened tomeand m yf am ily, you m ay wonder how 
such a tragedy couldhave happened in western civili zation, in Europe. My hope is that 

with the benef it of history and m em ory, we will  all beableto recognize and resist the 

forces of hatred, prejudice, anddivision thatexist in our own tim e. 
 
 
By speaking aboutthose painf ul tim es, I am doing m y best tohonor them emory
