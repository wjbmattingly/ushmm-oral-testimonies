very much i n 
life.  That nobody can chase

om us anything.  It's ours.  
It belongs to us.  And we  have 
such good neighbors and we ha ve su

our workers in the tannery, 
they were so devo
ted t o us .  And e ven, we ha

 Yiddish just like we did.  An
d we  wer e  so , we we re so  well 
known i n t o wn.  That  we 
coul dn't underst and t hat  some thi ng c
ould happen to us. 
 And the day that 
the war broke out, we 
were having a good 
time in our garden.  We were
 all sitting, boys and girls,  
we wer e ha ving a good ti me .  And a ll of a sudden t h

war , a war bro ke o ut.  
We  c oul dn't belie ve i t .  We  ra n 
home to the hous es a n
d we  couldn't  unde rs tand what ha ppe ne d here . 
Q: When you s ay the  wa r br oke

 what  a war  means even. 
Q: So, ma ybe you can tell

A: Well , e ve r ybody we nt  to their  house a nd I ca me
 and eve rybody was a fraid

for e xa mpl e, we won't have a ny ne ws what 's goi

And I went into the Comm

friendly with him.   And I asked 
hi m, ple ase se e the y s houl d not ta ke a wa y our ra dio.  Thi s is a

And my br other  was cryi ng,

one in t o wn he  had a motor cycle .  And  
they wanted to confiscate it, his mo
torcycle, to mobilize.  And he sai
d, let him hide, I'll stay behind. 
It was a lot of things th
a t  happe ned, but we  ha d t he pr ivile ge s  to
 bene fit fr om pe ople t hat we knew 

that t hey wi l l  hel p us .  And t hat
's when, but , it di dn't ta ke t oo lo
ng when t he Russia ns mar che d i n.  
Then we started to feel problems.
  Because we knew that we will be
 the ones who will suffer more  
than anybody else.  Th e day of Fo
rshoshona(ph), we were all in 
the te mpl e, di d not know what 's

goi ng on.  And we ca me out  from 
the temple, we see ta

they are Rus sians .  So, of c our se, 
t hen we start ed to feel war , we 
wer e confuse d, we di dn't what i s

Bec ause t he y di d se nd out t he 
poli ce and t he Commandant and ev
eryt hing, t he y s end t he m to 
Siberia.  And we had nobod
y, no protection over us, to wa tch us
.  So, there was a 
lot of certain bad 
experiences .  But we did over com
e that until it became worse. 
Q: Well , you were  under  t he Russi ans  for t w o year s  al most. 
A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: It became, they gave it to L
ithua nia.  We be ca me Lit hua nian
s, we not no more Pol e s.  The  
Lithuanians took it over. 
 And they forced us to 
go to lear n, i f a nybody di
d not speak Li thua nia n, i f 
you got any proble ms , they reall y 
use d to beat us up.  And we  st
arted t o st udy, but the langua ge, 
be for e Lit huania n, we sta r ted to st udy Rus sia n.  A
nd then in no ti me, we beca me Lithuania n, s o we  
had to l earn Lit hua nia n.  The Lithuania n la ngua ge
 a nd ther e  wa s, a very, ve ry har d l angua ge t o  
learn.  So, t here was a very, ver y
 hard, but ther e was fr eedom.  We
 sti ll, pe ople us ed to tra vel  
over sea s.  Peopl e coul d, I could,
 we  coul d tra ve l .  We were  goi
ng t o Vilna, we wer e goi ng to 
Ko vn a(p h),  Ko vn a wa s be for e  we  co ul

  And t he n it  
started a lot of 
coming fr om other towns because th

leave t he country 
for travel , for 
goi ng fart her  if you wa nt ed to go to t he Unite d St
ates or s o me thing.  It wa sn't  e as y, but  you c oul d 
ma ke it yet .  Whic h, wher e the Ge r ma ns were oc cu
pational , where the Rus si ans were occ upie d, you 
coul d not  tra vel. 

Q: S o,  th e R ussia ns  we
ren't in control? 
A: A very short time
, a ve ry s hort ti me . 
Q: So, how did t his a f fec t
 your li fe?   Your fa mily
 wa s fairl y a f fl uent  and 
under  the  Lit h uani ans  an d 
the Russi ans, di d t hey all o
w all of this privilege?  
A: No.  My, the whole  fa mi l y, fr
om the time that the 
Russi ans were , my fa mi ly did not sle ep at 
home.  I was the only one, 
we were raising a little bo

Vilna, he had to study

to be Bar  Mi tzva h.  So we br ought  hi m t o our  hou
se , it was a  open house .  
 Al way s  fa mil y ,  al wa ys  
people .  And we were tea ching hi m the Bar Mit va h, to
 be.  So, I 'm t he only one wit h hi m, I sl ept , w e  
slept in t he house.  Because the police depart ment 
wa s ver y close to our home .  And I used to st ay 
up unti l 2: 00 and i f I didn't see  a 
stati onwagon near the police, it 
mea ns  the y are  not goi ng t o come  
for us.  Then I used to go
 to sleep.  But I used to
 cry a lot and the little boy 
used to always come t o  
me and comf ort me.  Mir a , 
why are you cr ying?   Why a re you crying
?   I sa id, it 's oka y, I wa nt to cry  
because mother is not home.  Or 
my mother will co
me, I won't cry any mo re.  
So, they used to sleep  
always in di f fer ent  pl aces.  My t w
o br other s and my mother , and I  us
ed to st ay home and watch t h e 
house .  And that ti me , that wa s a bi
g trage dy.  We  didn't know that
 can come worse.
  An d, t h at wa s  
very har d.  We  kne w that any da y we 'll be se nt t o  
Siberia .  We  kne w it .  An
d it wouldn't take l ong, i f  
they would stay l onger .  
Q: So, they t ook a wa y yo
ur busi ne ss, t he t annery?  

A: The tannery, yes .  They nationa
liz ed the tanner y.  The y, everythi ng
 was  sold out qui ckly.  The y,  
when the  Russians ma rched 
i n, t he  ne xt day, whe n we got  up, we
 sa w a li ne t hat we  t hought they  
will push away our hous
e.  They were all lined up 
to get in to buy the merc
handise.  The leather. 
And we wer e used t hat e verybody c o me s in to buy what the y nee d.  There  was nothi ng.  You can't  

eve n, they woul d like t o buy, they di dn
't have it.  So, they told us th
ere is things, they
 wa nt as mu c h  
as the y coul d take .  Take it.  So, it didn't take too long to se ll out everyt hi ng, i n a couple of da ys , i t  

wa s all  e mp t y.  

Q: Now,  wh o bought 
t his?   The Russi ans?  
A: The Russians.  Until, this was 
when, until, then after, Lithuania 
was no problem. 
 Business was 
goi ng on a s nor mal .  

Q: So, how soon did the Ru

A: It wa s in September, 
I don't reme mber the date exactly.  But 
I know that as we

There was going to be a war with

Bec ause the far mers use d  to come t o town a nd br

give t he m s o methi ng, 
they di d not  want to t ake mone
y.  They wa nted exchange.  An
d the proble m was  for t he poor  
people .  So t his i s what for s o
me other ones, it was a lot of probl
e ms .   I r e me mbe r  we  ha d a co w  
always  in t h e hous e.  Now, whe n we
 mil k the cow, we al ways used to
 take it to taketo everybody of 
the neighbor s, a nnoyi ng some people  
that they need it, to
 gi ve  it away.  To he
lp t hem because they 
could not buy it.  This wa
s for some people a little, they felt that
 people, the poor 
people felt it more 
than di d pe ople t hat  were  well off. 
Q: But on t h e ot her  ha nd, your  mot h

A: Not for the Lit huanians.  For th

 but they wer en't too long wit h  us.  It w a s  
long enough beca use we  kne w we ar
e afr aid, it was long enough.  But ,
 not , the y we ren't too long. 
The  Lith uan i ans  
took it all. 
Q: So, do you r e me mbe r how long
 the Russi ans were, their presen

 Was it  a few  
mont hs, a  fe w weeks?  

A: No, a  fe w months .  A few months. 

Q: And then after they left, 
your mother c oul d c o me home?  
A: We we re ho me a ll da y , 
just a t  night  we di dn't sl e ep, beca us e mo

The  only proble m was beca use  we

we  will  have  to dis appear. 
Q: Do you re me mber  wh

A: We tried not to talk to

not  trust a nybody.  Beca us e ther

A: The Russ ians .  The ti me
 of the Russians.  For the time of th

for exa mple .   The bor der  between White Rus sia a nd Lit huani a  was only t h ree kilome te rs fr om our

to sneak it in.  And he  
brought hi m a hors e.  And he went  
t o pi ck up the horse  
and bring it to t h e bar n near  t he house.  I

 Brazil wher e my brot her s lived, my brot her di d

how you sa ve d my life?   And I said 
what di d I do?   He s aid, don't you

fr om the tannery.  But, he said, 
no, it 's a too be aut i ful hor se .  You

he 's ar guing wit h the polic e man .  
And the poli ce man wa s grabbi ng his

A: The tannery was nationa
lized.  So, we 
didn't have it.  But, we 
did have, we still were going on 
with some business.  Hi dden, ther
e  was hi dden busines s, it wa s not, 
bec aus e my brother  use d t o g o  
to Vil na and bring cert ai n mer chandi se that we 
used to sell, but ma ybe,
 maybe it woul d nor ma lize 
and we woul d ma ybe get into busi ness  again. 
 But  t he busine ss  wa s kind of not  nor mal . 
Q: But eve rything el se  we nt on?

Q: How would t hat mani fest it sel f?  

A: We  al wa ys h a d t o wa tch, t o k no w  that we ar e

are not, we are second-hand 
citizens.  We 're told the privileges th

e not, we weren't  
too much at home . 

Q: Wasthat troublesome? 

A: I, yes , be caus e, but we did not fe el it as ba d 
beca use a l o t of r e fugee s  were c o ming in, e ver y

 And we, of c ours e, any 
truck that st opped, we  we nt t o a sk the m what i s going on.  
And the y s ay, you 
don't know?  The 
Ger mans declared war .  And they 
are , they wer e r unning bac k to Russi a, be caus e Lit hua nia was full  
of Russi an peopl e.  They were under their comma
nd.  And so we kne w tha t
, we a ctual l y found out  
that ther e is goi ng to be a war again.  There was 
news that the Russians, that the Lithuanians are  
killing the Russians.  They are th
rowing them into the o
cean.  Because they act
ually want friends,  
they di dn't li ke t he m.  It wa s just
 superficial that  t hey lived i n har m
ony.  They were, 
they wanted to  
get ri d of t h e m.  And they, and t h
e war, early in the morning we 
hear d t he Ger ma n s mar chi ng in.  
Because, and I reme mber I had a cous
in that was in the Po
li sh Ar my a nd we didn'
t sle ep t hat night .  
We wer e sta ndi ng and ta lking, what  will  it be , what
 will he do?  Wh at is
 goi ng on?   We  did not 
know what  t o expe ct.  And 
we  he ard, I he ard, li ke  
some body would pl ay wit h
 rocks, t he noise li ke 
you throw rocks, so I sa ys, but what
 is thi s nois e ?   Do yo
u hear?  What  i s it? 
 They said, they are 
throwi ng par achutes .  And he
 sai d, you'll see .  Bec ause he kne w, 
he was i n  the ar my, he under stood  
better than we did.  They are para
chuting some people he
re.  And in no time 
they will march in. 
And it di dn't  take too long, a nd in t he  mor ni ng, th
e Ger mans started t o marc
h in.  So, we le ft t he 
house a nd we we nt to s o me of our 
worker s.  We stayed there all day.
  And then we de c i ded we have 
to go to our house.  To 
see what, what will it
 be with us?  Of course, in
 those times there was no, no 
ca mps , no death ca mps , not hing.  
They just, well, people
 live d under the Ger ma n occ upati ons.  I t  
was scar y. There was a l ot of
 t hings goi ng on.  But, 
we did not expect what 
we ha d lat er on.  And, 
but we c a me  home a nd we live d for a whi le.  On 
the se cond da y, for 
exa mple, I was s t a ndi ng i n the  
window and a couple of Germans 
walked up to us and one Ger man
 l ooks  up a nd I ha d a watc h i n  
my ha nd.  And he sai d, gi

why s hould I give hi m t he watc h?   I 
coul dn't understa nd it.  So, I s aid, 
no.  And my  brother h

and give it t o hi m in a hurry.  Do
n't you know what thi s is?   He ta
kes a J ew i n a mi nute.  You'll be

In a way, they us

 i f a man wit h a bear d, 
they used to follow him if
 he went to the temple , 
and then cut  his beard of f or  beat

  We di d not  fee l  it i n our  hous e beca us e  
nobody was allowed, the

A: As far as I reme

 Bu t, I know there was inci

om the Poles that had, wa

to this and this 
house ,  where was  
ma d s o me body, and ta ke the m out , 
for  example, to the ce meter y  and 
shoot over his hea d.  Just , j ust  
to, they did not kill anybody
, but to torture them.  To
 put a fear in them.  Th
is I know.  I heard it.  
We used to hear a l ot about it .  Is they cut t he 
beard off this , the y di d th
is, just torturing certai n 
people.  But, there

 not allowed to come

We  c oul dn't, we wer e not allowed,
 t h ey weren't al lowed 
to bri ng to sell  s o met hing t o J ews.  We , 
espe ciall y, did not fe el it 
as mu ch because we had so many frien

they had to risk their life, they 
us ed t o  bring us a n yway.  The  war 
woul d go on a nd out  of 20 years , 
we  would ha ve ple nty of

Q: So your Polish frie nd

Q: S o,  whe n you  s a

house and s he starte d to cry, oh, 
my God, oh, what wil l
 we do, what wil l , I says , what happened, 
what happened?  She sai d, di dn't you see all the

who has  gol d, who ha s s ilver, who ha
s mat erials ,  who ha s lea t her, wh
at ever it is, t hey should bri ng  
it in to the police.  And this is a sign they are 
going to do something to us.  They'll make it like  
nobody told about killing.  They 
make a ghetto.  A
nd it started a big commo
tion in town, everybody 
was running to the police bringing 
in some whatever they want.  
Wha t e ver the y could hide , the y  
wer e.  They wer e alread
y hi dde n.  We  alre ady gave it a wa y  to  s o me a m ong our Po

hide a lot of things.  But, whatever
 we  had, we wer e goi ng a nd bringing
 it in to the police.  And, thi s  
wa s going on all mor ning, a nd t hen 
a lot of people started to leave 
t o wn .  An d th en 
we hear d that  
two sisters got killed.
  They were trying to le
ave the town.  And they ca
ught them and 
they killed, 
and this stopped a lot of 
people.  But, we still di
d not, my mother still orde
red my two brothers an d 
we ha d t wo refugees , young men, 
that they ran away fr om the 
occupation of the Germans where  
they occupied before us. 
 And they got dresse
d a lot of clothes, and she 
told them where to go, to 
one of a s hoe maker t hat he us ed t o
 be a fr iend of ours.  An d it wa
s onl y about a kilo
me ter and a hal f  
fr om town.  They should go ther
e and stay there until we see what
 will come out.  
We  still didn't 
know what i s goi ng t o happen to us
.  And as the y, a nd were sure t h
at they left already.  They got  
dres sed a nd l e ft .  And my 
sister, we br ought my sis t

We  br ought her fr om t he r e with 
the  t wo c hildr en beca use  he r hus ba nd was  take n a w ay right  the  first

 They occupi ed their town an
d they t ook a way, t he took t h e  
doct ors and the lawyers and the t
eachers.  He was a te
acher.  And t hey took 
hi m ri ght  away, they 
killed him, but we did not know th
at.  All the time the told, the 
explanation was they took him for 
work someplace.  And ever
y day we used t o send 
somebody to, they used 
to say they're worki ng 
near Wa rsa w, so we s e nd s o mebody near Wars aw.  
They wer en't ther e .  They s aid, oh, t hey l e ft

t hey transferred them ther

we, it took a long time 
until we realized that they kill
ed him.  And 
so my sister, 
there  was  no exc ha nge, t hey di dn't ha ve what to e x

she li ved wit h us .  And my

 I c a me int o the  house and

 I thought, gee, tha t 's not ,  that 's not

 my mother, you

But we weren't ready, wher

ran, we thought we will 
go to one of our wor ker s, to get un

by coincidence, in th e 
morni ng, we  had a lot of mone y i n

deci de d to go hi de it where the tannery i s.  
Because t he tannery is i n the back of

wa s in t he a f ternoon, a nd then at ni ght , we deci de d, 
and I said t o  my mot her ,

opened the barn door, a
nd I ran, it was not t oo fa

l town, anyplace was not  
that far.  My mother 
looked around and she fo un
d my brothers, s
itting in the barn. 
 And she says, 
what are you doing her e?  They say t hey coul dn't 
leave t o wn because there 
was, there were rumors 
that they are shooting.  So, we retu
rned back home.  So she said to them, what is my life?  My life 
doe sn't mean anything.  I f  you don't 
sa ve yours el f, what does it me an 
to me?   So, s he sai d, go to the  
garden, we  had a  bi g gar den
 in the, right after the 
houses .  And s he sai d t o  
them, go in the garden. 
Lay down under the leaves fr om the 
cucumber s because t hey 
are very big now.  And,
 see, at night i f  
you ca n get out .  And s h e di d, i n 
t he meanti me, she didn't , I l eft . 
 And when I wa s

the Poles there, said to me, Mi rchka( ph), where ar e you r unning? 
 You'll ge t shot, d
on't run.  I'll tell 
you, I 'll get into, where do 
you wa nt  to go?   I was not s mart  
enough, and I told the m whe r e I 'm

through the window, I jump ed over
 and I crossed the street  and I  
was reunited with my sister

A: So, I said to her, don'
t worry, we won't stay here. 
 I will try, I'll take one 
child and I'll try to move  
to the fact or y.  To t he ta nner y, bec ause it 's ver y 
close t here.  I t  was close t o the t anner y, he was  
worki ng for us, all my li ve I kne w 
hi m.  And his brot hers wer e  wor k
i ng for us, too.  
And, i f t hey'll  
catch me t here, all they can do is kill me.  But I 
am in my own place so we 
will not cause troubl e t o  
you.  And I got into 
there, to the house, and I 
was still thinking about the Po
le who gave us the idea 
to run to his  hous e.  And I also kne w from a not he
r Pole that  ca me a bout  five days before to our  
house , and he looke d up and we were
 boar ding the sister and t he child
re n, and he war n ed us, he sai d  
to my mothe r , why di d y
ou bring your daught er a nd c hildren he
re?   The Lithua nia ns wants a clea n 
Lith ua nia wi th n o J e ws.   An d i n
 Wh ite Russia, the Jews, I don't 
know how long, but  the  Je ws who  
still live in Lithuania, they are goi
ng to kill all the Jews
.  And we knew that 
he is from the more 
intelligent Poles, not just 
the far mer , i t  was a ver y rich far mer. 
 But he had children,
 they were very  
high ra nk i n  the Pol i sh ar my, all offic ers .  We
 knew that he knows some
t hing, but  the wa y he 
expr ess ed it , s o, we did not wa nt to a cce pt  
it.  So, after he left
 us , my mother  sai d,  
_________________, he

__________.  We couldn't  
belie ve it , we di dn't wa nt  to belie ve
 it.  Who i s goi ng t o cha se us out of
 the house?  It's ours.  It went 
fr om generation to generation.  And 
he was, he gave us also the id
ea, the only ones 
that will survive  
is people that they will hi
de.  And my ol
dest brother, later on, went 
and he stayed with him for  
awhile .  But ,  it wa s very hard to hide beca use th
ey all had people working 
for them, and they knew 
they will talk to those, they are ke
eping Jews.  But, as I was in the ta
nnery all the day, then I told my  
sister , i f I pass thr ough right , sh
e shoul d come .  But we did not kn
ow where my mother i s.  M y  
mother wasn't with us
.  We  kne w t h at my brothe rs, I  di dn't 
know that they are in town.  We we re  
sure that they are pr otected.  Because the first 
thing for the  prote ction wa
s t he men.  What  we 
looked.  And as I, and I said to 
t he janitor, where i s Marisha( ph)? 
 Marisha  was ma rrie d  to hi m, she  
wa s a mai d for us.  And I  wa nte d to
 go to town and find out where 
my  mother is.  We  didn't know 
what, we di dn't know what is go
ing on.  That ni ght , the y get  out 
everybody to t he te mple, al l the  
Je ws.  But , we di d not know what
 is going on.  So  I said, Lede
r(ph), go a nd fi nd out where my

mother is.  I thought maybe
 she we nt bac k t o the  house .  And he said, s he  is not home  and I don't  
wa nt you here.  So I  t
hought, well , we starte d 
to feel mor e and more 
that  we ar e  not  want ed 
anyplace.  We have no place, we 
have no way, we don't know what to
 do.  So, I said, no, I will not 
be her e too long.  And t here wa
s a slaughterhouse right near  our
 tannery.  I saw a young ma n 
coming out, so there was a 
hope chest standing in th
is little house.  And ther
e was even some of our 
things.  I took out a piec
e of mat erial for a suit  
and I c alled hi m, I don't r e
me mber his  na me .  And I  
said, if you tell me where 
Kokochan( ph) is, a vill age, where t he 
Pole told us that if we want, we 
should r un t o hi m, I will give you 
this piece of mat erial.  He sai d, I 
don't want to be ki lled.  Because  
if I'll go with you, I'll 
get killed.  I said, no you 
won't.  You go from one 
side and I go
 from another 
side, far away from each other.  
And, if they catch me
, obviously, they will k
ill me, but I will never 
say that you are goi ng with me.  I wi ll never , I 
pr omise you, I  will not gi

and he showed me wher e Kokochan 
is.  I couldn't get into his, in
to this ma n's house right away 
beca use  the r e were , I s a w, the r e is  peopl e are  dri v

didn't think there is only, there 
must be Ger ma ns, and I ca nnot

, I was  hiding in a  
little forest.  And then, and they left, I went there.
  But I asked him to go a

the other two chi l dre n, a nd s he 'll gi
ve you more things.  She ' ll pay go
od off.  And he  did, a nd he  
brought my sister and the children 
t here.  But, t here was, at  the 
time of the Russi
ans, this Pole 
himself, was hiding, 
because he was a rich far mer.  So, he wa
s afraid that they will send him out to  
Siberia, too.  So, he had 
worker s, and the worke r s  did not  want 
us .  The y wa nt us out and out  an d 
out .  So, we told t he m t h at we wi ll not sta y.  We
 onl y want t o  know wher e 
my mot her  is.  So , an d  
the owne r, t he far mer , was not  in. 
 He went  t o _________
_______ to see  what 's
 goi ng on with the  
Jews.  Wh at kind of commotion 
is  goi ng on.  So, I  sai d, the  mi nut
e you will find out where my

 be gone fr om your house.  We will
 not st ay he re.  Not  knowing wher e  
will we go, what will we 
do, where is anybody?   I, anywa y, t hey
 kept , we  want you out, we want  
you out.  So, when he ca me , he ga

y.  And we were
 going to move  
to a village that we knew
 where the Tartars are. 
 And they are Muslims. 
 There was only one small  
village, but they used to 
buy leather from us.  
So, we thought we w
ill go there meanti
me, if they will

accept us, we don't know.  But  at le
ast  it 's close t o White Russi a, sma

will have to go to Ra

 He did go a nd he ca me wit h the

 An d he said, so my place 
was, I fe lt I have to go

information.  Where my moth

The y are hiding in a s hoe ma ker 's ho

And they are there, they're hidden in the barn.  If 
they will be able to get 
out, we don't know.  H e  
said, but if they will be 
able, they will leav

morrow night.  
I was, went, I was with 
my sister there, we had what to eat
.  Obviously, they gave us wh at to
 eat.  An d, but, 
we don't, we did 
not know what we shoul d 
do.  We were abs ol utel y, we di dn't
 know where  should we t urn, where  
should we go.  And, the n he tol d us , we di dn
't kno w wh at wa s 
goi ng on, but we heard that on  
We dnesday, they took out all the 
Jews fr om the temples there a
nd they brought them out a bi g 
market which used to be the, the 
farmers used to bring in their cattle
 and their food to sell, there was 
one, li ke a far mer 's mar k et they ca
lled it.  Once a week th
ey used t o come ther
e  with e veryt hing t o 
sell to town.  And my mother is ther
e, too.  We told
 the  pe opl e.  We  di d not  
know what the fate will,  
what will be with us, we didn't know
 what will be with her.  My brot
hers did not come out yet.  But, 
next ni ght t h ey di d c o me  in, t he y ca me in.  The y
 came  in, but of course, 
we kne w we cannot  be  
there .  So, we move d to a not her pla ce ,  anot her, it wa
s a mother to this worker
 of ours.  She took us 
in for a w hil e.  And, knowing that  
is the hardest part, w
ith children, we have 
three s mall children. 
We ha ve a 13 year old, we have
 a t wo and a ha lf a nd a year .  So
, we de cide d, si nce we have the

 We'll send them there and ther

see if they will me antime  be th

, until we reunite toge
ther.  Until we will 
see, maybe we will all go
 to live in Wh ite Russia.  With my 
mother's fa mily.  Be
cause my mother 
had two sist ers a nd she  had two, th

small towns ther e.  And in the 
meantime, we will 
be around with them 
together.  But, it took
 quite awhile until we
 got all together.

So , we came and we went to Radden
.  It was 14 kilometers
 fr om our town.  And i n no ti me , the y  
ma de  a ghett o. 
Q: Let me as k you a ques tion here .  Did you find 
out what happene d to the peopl e who were in the

A: Ye s, yes .  My mot her ca me, she kne w everyt

that everybody should come to the 
temple.  They can bring in what 
they carry on their shoulders .  
The y gave t he m stic ks a nd they t old ever ybody t o

everybody.  The na
me of this town wa

brought from a not her , from Wal kini k(ph) was a s m
all town.  The y br ough
t Jews fr om Walkinik, 
also, to the temple.  And 
it was very crowded and there were peop
le sick, people ha ving childre n.  
No facilities to go out.  But I 
heard that one of my 
girlfriends and 
the Commandant, 
the Lithuanian 
Comma n da nt ca me t o t he  te mple , she  we nt out , be caus e
 we knew hi m, a nd she 
sai d to hi m, gi ve us

 She says, or kill us. 
Pic k what you want .  Or  k

humans.  And he said, we 'll see, we'll  
see.  That was Sunda y ni ght , Mo

brought all of the Jews, all of 
them out fr om the te

nd t hey tol d ever ybody t o 
sit down, nobody ca n sta nd up.  Now, one man, he wa s ast h matic
 and he c oul d not bre ath.  So he  
stood up.  And t hey sh

i n this par king pla ce.  And the n, i n no

No w, we  we ren 't  th ere,  b u
t e very day that Polis h ma n use d t o bring us all

strong men, young and stro

for wor k.  There was a big far m 
near  Ashashoc(ph), where t h e owne

they s e nt hi m to Si beria .   But of c ourse, t he gr

That  was n 't  t r ue.  Beca us
e the minute they got them
 out , they had dug all  of 
the dit che s.  Ne ar the  
ce meter y.  And they took 
them and they shot th
em ther e.  They bro
ught us i n for mat ion, fo r  
example, that one of my 
cousins , got  out from the  gra ve and he 
sai d, i f you wa nt, I 'll  give you t he  
hair off my  head, but shoot 
us right.  Because 
about, they were all, they 
ma de them undr
ess a nd the y  
were shooting them and th
ey were fal ling int o the  gra ves .  Bu
t some  weren't shot.  Th ey covered 
them when they were 
still alive.  So, he 
said, shoot us right. 
 But we still 
didn't believe it.  And one  
of our worker's  wives came to my  
mother , t o bring her  food, and tel l
 her, we  wa nt to save you. 
Once you are out of
 here, come, we will save yo
u.  They used to bring food 
and give it to the people 
that were watchi ng around t her e. 
 And t he y wa nted t o save her. 
 And my mother  sa ys, s he i s not 
going out.  She is afraid. 
 Until on the second day,  one came and she actua
lly beat up my mother, 
and s he kic k ed her out with her feet .  She put a bi
g sha wl on her and s he ki cke d her so bad that she  
brought her up to a nearby house a
nd put her up i n  the, made her go 
up in t he atti c and she said, you  
are going here to lay, I will cove
r you with straw, but 
you cannot move until 
I will come back to 
you.  And she was hiding 
there for, in the attic, for the da
y and at night sh
e heard somebody, 
somet hing movi ng t here .  So
, s he di dn't know, is it a mouse, i t 's 
huma n or what.  Bu
t, she got clos e r  
to the place and she t ouched a han
d.  And she sai d , who ar e you?  Ve
ry qui etly.  And she said, I am 
Sonja Kovaski(ph), which she marrie
d, t his  is my  sister -in-l a w now. 
 And, of c ourse , the y c oul dn't 
talk a ny mor e.  The y hea r d the Ge r m ans drinking 
and si nging and e njoying
 and everyt hing.  And 
she di dn't know what is  going on.  And how l o ng sh
e is going to be there.  No food, no drink,  
nothing.  But this 
was Friday, until Frid
ay.  Friday afternoon she ca
me, that woman, took her out 
fr om t he atti c and s he sa ys, s he dr ess ed her li ke a far mer, s he gave her a pail and a , I don't know, in  
Poli sh you c all it, kapatc hka( ph) , but you dig pota toes
.  And s he says, you are going to foll ow me. 

She dre sse d her with a sc ar
f and she brought her in 
the hous e a nd they gave  
her a gla ss of milk a nd 
a piece of bread, and 
she sa ys, you are going t o  your c hil dr

bring you to your  
childr en.  And, but you cannot  mo
ve , you ca nnot look ar ound, you 
cannot do anythi ng.  She  di d not  
want t o tell her t hat ever ybody's k
ill ed already.  Because 
she was afraid i n  case 
my mo ther faints or  
something, what will she do 
with her?  So, sh

.  And she brought her to

Kokocha n.  And then 
he brought her t o us beca us e  we wer e
 in ____________, i t
 was a n other s mall  
village there.  And then 
she told, she came, she to
ld us what had happene
d.  That Thursday they  
fi nished all the men killing andFriday there were still some wo
men, and where the women are 
killed, and where the me
n are killed, and we s
till could not 
believe it. 
Q: This  was  your whole  t own?  
A: Yes.  Thi s was, because when my mot her , wh
en ther e was, on the prem
ises where they were, 
when they told my mother
 why they want to
 save her, and they told 
her where they are killing the  
Jews, she came up t o, there wer e 
t w o doct ors , J e wis h doc tors .  An
d she s ays to t he m,  what shoul d 
we do bec a use so me young people wa nte d to re volt 
against it, they said, let 's kill at least some 
Germans.  We 're getting killed, le
t's kill, they didn't le
t them because they 
said, because if you 
revolt, we'll all get killed.  Obviou
sly, they would have, they killed 
them anyway.  Bu
t, he said to 
the m, s o my  mot her, thi s  is boyka vochni k(ph) , 
you are such a smart  woma
n, you ar e a business  
wo ma n.  Can you believe that they
 will  kill  4,000 pe ople?   No, it
's  impossible!  Th ey won't do it, 
they cannot do it!  And th
ey made her, she is st
upid to believe them.  A
nd this is, still when it  
happe ned, nobody belie ved it, that th
at 's goi ng to happe n.  We  thou
ght , the y 'll ma ke a ghetto.  We  
thought they will take aw
ay fr om us  e veryt hing.  But  we  coul d 
not beli eve  the y a r e goi ng t o kill  us .  
We couldn't believe it.  And that's 
how we were fooled all the time . 
 Bec a use we di d not belie ve it. 
And later on, in experience, ever
y town was a different way of killing.  It was always before a  
Jewish holi d ay.  There was always 
a di ff, there was always wi th a 
di fferent  excuse.  There was not  
exc uses , but  the y were  di ffere ntl y t hat nobody c
oul d belie ve it.  Now, my
 si ster was with my 
mother's fa mily and, until 
one day came a sele
ction.  They took 
out there.  And th
ey put them, the y  
told them to get out in the mark
et.  And they, my sist
er walked with her tw
o children with no  
hus ba nd.  So, le ft , right, left , ri
ght.  And my uncle saw that she 
goes left and t hey alr eady hear d

Q: In Raddan? 

A: In Ra dda n.  We wer e n't there 
too long.  Li fe was consi gne d to 
the room, we had one room.  We 
still had food to eat because the pe

fo od.  We did not know what any 
more can gi ve.  What they
 al l ca n gi ve.  We  di d not .  We j ust  
existed.  Nothing, 
we di d not know a

 Wh ere we are.  But, we

A: No, be ca use Ra dda n wa s s malle r

were hiding fr om our to

from our town.  And, but it 
was very little conversation 
there, very little, we didn
't know what will be with
 us.  We didn't have a

not have any hope

 what will be.

A: We had friends that , be for e  the war my mot he r  us
ed to help them a lot, 
they wer e  poor .  And I ,  
one night, we were in the villages, yet, it was before th
e holidays.  I said, I'
m going to get a prayer 
book.  And I  riske d to go to the t o
wn fr om the vill age w
ith, of cour se, wit h th
e woma n's  daughte r . 
But she ha d to go on one  side , we al wa ys arr anged it, 
t hat i f they c atc h us, they s houl d not , peopl e 
should not suffer from us. 
 And I ca me  to t he se peop
le and t hey sa y me , the y c oul dn't believe it . 
They were, where is everyb
ody?  Wh o is ali ve?  B
ecause they knew t hat we, th
at they already kill ed  
our t o wn.  And I say, we are all t h
e famil y, except my sist er 's husb
and.  And, what ca
n I  do for you?   
We  had not hing, I j ust r a n out fr om 
the house like I stayed, with noth
ing, I didn't even
 have time to  
put on a pai r  of s hoes.  I took t he shoes with me  
and ran out  in a pair of slipper s.  So I said, no , 
nothing, I really don't, I want a toothbrush.  Forget ab out toothpaste, a toothbr
ush and a little salt to  
be abl e to br ush our te eth.  So, 
s he sa ys, no, but you don't ne e d an
y under wea r or nothing?   I said , 
no, a little towel and a dish
towel.  So she brought 
me and I, and she gave 
me a prayer book and I 
we nt bac k.  But , t hat 's al l we wa nted.  I fel t , I  
al ways ha d my prayer book 
wit h  me .  Ev en wh en  we  
wer e war m, the mi nut e I hear d the Ge
r ma n 's boots  wa lki ng by the hous
e, I took, I used to grab the  
prayer book and pray.  
And we were, we were still believe th
at there would come a miracle. 
Another day, another day, there will 
a miracle for us.  We , 
something God has to 
do for us.  It was, 
but the da y never ca me .  It never ca me .  The onl y 
one that was right is thePolish man that took us 
out t hat  ni ght bec ause t hi s was Sa tur d ay, Fri d
a y night and on Sunda y, 
the y s urround Ra dda n and 
they we nt fr om house t o house a
nd we did not ha ve White Rus sian 
pass port s, the t ook hi m a nd they 
killed hi m.  And we would have been in this part 
because we di d not have Ru
ssian passport.  And he 
had the fe eli ng of fear  a n d he t ook
 us  out  at night .  It 's li ke 
a pr ophet.  It 's  unbeli eva ble .   
Q: So, during this perio
d, instead of being resent
ful, you prayed har der?  
A: Yes.  We prayed harder.  
We prayed harder and believed th
ere will come a miracle.  Every 
holi day t hat what, how did we kn
ow it 's a holi da y ?   We ha d no 
cale ndars , we had not hi ng.  By the  
sun, by the moon.  And we use d to

it must be a miracl e, it mu

 we were hidi ng, the fir st one th

and my mot her di d not e a

she was afraid that we ar e goi ng to
 di e in her house.  So, s he we nt
 one da y to the ghet t o and we nt  
into a ra bbi and as ke d what shoul d s he do.  She is 
hidi ng Je ws and s he is afr aid we are  going to die  
there .  Wha t  should she , what ca

and he t old her, you bring it ho m e  
to the m and t ell the m, t he y, oc casi onal l y the y fe el we

 No bone s, not any of 
the bones, j u st eat  a piece of meat
 for survi val.  But  the future, we
 did not, I don'
t think we were  
thinking hard.  I don't thi
nk we had the ability of th
inking what will happen 
to us.  Wh at should we 
do?   Where should it go?   Wh at, we
 didn't, but we fe lt like whatever 
they advi sed us , t his, t he fir st  
far mer, t he one that had the sons that they were hi
ring in Pol i sh ar my a n d ever ythi ng, we felt t hat  
they ar e right.  The onl y way we can
 survi ve is by hidin
g.  And I wa s ver y  mu
ch fed up and I was 
against it.  I kept telli
ng to my  brother, wh y do we have 
t o be  di ffere nt?   Everybody, al l my 
girlfriends are killed.  Ev
erybody is killed.  Wh y do 
we, why do we have to be
 stubborn and want to 
leave?   Wha t  pur pose?   Wh
at?   Wha t , the y are al l killed, nobody 
i s here around us.  And he sai d, I  
wa nt to live to tell the world what ha d happe ned t o us.  And I use d to scre a m, why do we ha ve to  
tell the world?  The world 
doe sn't thi nk about us, they don't he lp 
us .  And he sai d, I wa nt to live it  
through.  He  had a vision, he  want ed t o lea ve a nd 
I  wa s gi ving up beca us e t h
e prayers di d not help. 
And this is our, then it started.  
Of c ourse, thi s Pol e  ha d a  bi g vi sion
 and he told us how we  can hide.  
He ma de hi ding pl ace s for us in th
e hous es, but t h e Pol es ha d a s me
ll, somehow they used to feel, 
that this and this fa mily is hidi
ng somebody.  The y ha d a very fun
ny fe eling.  I f t hey sa w a n ext r a  
fr om t he c hi mney, e xtra s moke is comi ng out , s h e 
is baki ng brea d more t h
an nor mall y she woul d 
bake for her sel f.  This is  how t h
ey used to find out. 
 And if one knew, right away they started the 
other one, they'r e starting to talk. 
 And then they used to come to 
the homes and find
 and kill them.  
It was e ver y day tha t  we  hear those s t ories .  
But, this man wa tche d over us, with ma ki ng a good 

hidi ng plac e.  And he st a r ted t o 
ha ve food, a nd my younge st brothe
r was a l wa ys ver y daring to go  
out at night and bri ng food 
in.  And we lived with th
e pigs, with the horse s, wi
th the cows.  It's all 
we , you coul d talk to the m and asking the m t o why ar
e they so lucky?  That  they are free and we ar e 
mice.  We ar e mi ce.  And, but we
 ha d to, then we wer e cha ngi ng 
pl ace s from one place to another 
place.  He also always di
vided us.  He said if in
 one place they will catch,
 he wanted 
so badly we

should sur vi ve, t hat he was, he had a better visi on 
that we did .   Th at we wi ll 
hide se par ately t he n i f  
one part get killed, the ot
her one will survive.  And then he br
ought us into a pl

very good hiding place th

He was sent enced t o death fr om

Q: What mot i vate ds o me bod

ri sks for other peopl e? 
A: I would s ay, he wa nte d to s how

his mother, his fathe r was dead, 
and his  mot her use d t o, we alwa

what will it be?  You'll get killed.
  Why do you have to do it?  And Maria was alwa

 Give up.  You'll get kille

the minute he used to start with su

And we  br ought hi m he re. 
 He used to pray every day, my

And he was  suc h, so beloved a mong 
the Poles.  He was in

wa nt t o s urvive.  He did not  kn

onl y, he wants to survi ve.  So it 
mea n s if nobody sees hi m, he 'll su

my cousin went to the 
window a nd they knocked on t he wi ndow, and t hey a ske d the pos ses sor s,  
that's the help that he left  to 
do his ground.  They should
 let him in and they 
said they 
will not let 
hi m i n.  So my br ot her s a id t o t h

m going to kill 
you if you won't 
let me in.  So you have to let us 
in.  If you don't want 
us, we will not stay, but 
we have to have that 
you s hould go t o Ra dda n a
nd bri ng Ka shmis h( p h) here and he has to
 help us to deci

Maybe he can transfer us to th

not too fa r fr om, they call it  
Nat cha put che(ph) , where  the Parti sans 
were there.  And we have no

able to r un t he fact ory fr om hi m be c a use he star
t e d it in Ger ma ny a nd he  was wor ki n g there al l hi s

they won't run and th

 But it came when 
we sent the last 
ti me , he wa s  gone alrea d y.  It wa
s too late .  We had a druggi st in
 Li pte ns hoc , t hat t he y le ft  hi m 
alive.  They killed every

ecause they did not 
have another druggi

So they let him.  We kept begg

a day that we sent

What was t hat? 
A: Yeah .  T his wa s wh e n I wa nte d 
to meet  this ma yor  of this town. 
 And see  what  he  can do for  us . 
Maybe he c an hel p us.  To hi de as Poles  was  i m
pos sibl e bec ause  our acc ent 
wa sn't good.  To go 
dee p in Pola nd.  To stay here , it was i mpos sibl e, e ver
ybody knew us.  So, but, 
we wa nte d to ta ke out  
the children, my sister an
d the children from the 
ghetto.  Because we knew
 there woul d come a da y 
they will get killed.  Besi
des that, we didn't know 
tomorrow brings us eith

he 'll ta ke me  to this, Schmi gera( ph) wa s his na me. 
 We'll meet hi m i n church
 and we'll talk to hi m 
and see what he can do for 
us.  That night I was resting in the 
attic, I and my moth
er I remember, I  
had a drea m.  I ha d a  drea m, 
______________.  And I highl y be lieved that this can come to  
somet hing.  You know, you st art bel i eving in t hi ngs whic h, you 
know, we  neve r di d.  We beli eve d  
in dreams.  We  belie
ved, there was a lot of su
perstition going on.  And I 
thought, that 
dream means  
somet hing because t he tr anslat ion is
, there'll come a day th
at a bear will l eave to
get her wit h the shi p, 
kavish(ph).  An
d maybe there will come a pea
ce that they'll want us to 
leave.  So, I 
will go to the 
chur ch because I 've never been to a church and,
 accor dingly, we wer e not supposed to enter t he 
chur ch, beli evers .  And I went wit h hi m, I wa
s dr ess ed l i ke a pea sa nt, a nd we  ca me i nto

and we ar e going to chur ch
.   An d we  we nt a nd  I t old hi m,  I 'll fa

Whate ver I 'l l  do, you go aft er me, you do.  And t hen
 ______________ c a me to us in c hurc h and he 
said he cannot talk to us now.  
But  they ar e buil di ng a new church at
 the end of the town.  I should, 
after we get through here, 
he should take me there a
nd he will talk to me.  So
 we met him and I told 
hi m t he stor y s o he can ma ke us  ou
t Poli sh pa per s.  All of us.  An
d ma ybe  we  ca n s urvi ve a s Pol e s ,  
but we have to go away 
from this neighb
orhood.  So, I 
said no, because our Po
lish accent will give  
us out right awa y.  Beca use we 
spoke Polish more like the White 
Russians, not like in Wa rsaw, lik e 
_____________.  So I sai d ab
out to give away th
e children, then we'
ll take at least the sister with us.  
So he said, I'll try.  I'll try ev
erything because I will no
t fo rget what you di

Russia n oc c upati on, that  he was hi

 Siberia.  This Pole was his  
cousin and he used t o come during
 the market day [phone ringing]. 
 After the churc h, we  we nt t here  
and we met hi m.  And he tol d me what he ca n do, 
he s aid, al right , he will

 And I knew that this

miracle.  It was a big, ri

 good people.  Very nice. 
 And they will take the 
two children to ra

er ything wasn't easy.  Because ever ythi ng

no tele phone s, not hing. 
 And she said she is 
not givi ng the chil dre n, s he wa nts t o

The n I  went  into the  ghet to a nd I met  some pe opl

they were talking and 
they told me what they suffer fr om this man.  And to

And I tal ke d  to hi m a nd he tol d

my sister got killed,
 in May, 1942.   
Q: Wh at wa s  the  n a

A: Vasilishoc(ph).  Those 
pictures we just looked at were 
Vasilishoc.  They we

wa s fa mous  beca use  we had a good c o mmunicati on 
bet wee n Vil na, Li der ,  Gordna( ph)  and we had  
the bus pass ing through.  It was li ke  a fre e way 
going thr ough town.  But ,  other wi se, t hos e s mall  
towns  di dn't  ha ve a  bus coming i n
.  The y didn't  have a t axi .  We 
didn't  have t axi s,
 either.  Right 
be for e t he  war, some  ta xi s us

Q: When you we nt i nto t his
 churc h, wer e you ner vous?  
A: Very mu ch.  Very mu ch.  Because I was 
afraid that God is 
going t o punis h me . 
Q: Yo u were  afr a id God

A: Fa ith, yes . 

Q: You didn't feel forsaken
 by your  fai t h at  all?  
A: No, but, I don't know. 
 We were, and we wer e n't that reli gi

we  would pr oba bly be al s o a s re ligi ous as  my fr

Q: Di d you have  any cont act wit h Part isans?  

A: No .  Bu t we k ne w th a t  they e x

ti me  in a place, t hey wer e
 right in the past ure, in that, wher e th
e Partisans are.  We
 were there in the 
mi ddle.  And that wa
s a very good pl ace t o hide.  Because his 
son, t hat Pol i sh man, hi s son went  to  
work for the Germans.  He was 
a policeman, he got killed.  So no
body would ever be
lieve that he 
has Je ws in his house.  But , 
there was once, t hey call it a bl av
a( ph) , the y surr ound, the Ger ma ns  
surrounded the, this, 
the woods and were tr

killed during it.  And this 
___________ was  just  movi ng arou

from the grenades 
and fro m e v erythi ng.  And the n we
 decide d t o l ea ve, I did not, 
we didn't  want t o sta y t h ere. 
Q: So t here  wa s a  bi g, str ong
 Ger ma n  prese nce  a nd you were  ve ry a w are of t he wa r?  
A: Oh , we wer e  a ware , they had , th e r e wer e  P oli sh

 used to be in contact 
wit h t he Part isans.  Ther e were 
some.  The Polish people
, whe n they or ga nized 
agains t the Je ws , but  
not all of the m.  They we re not , th
ere was a cousi n  of t h
is Polish man that we 
wer e survi ved by hi m, 
this ______________.  That he wa s 
called to join the White Partisans.
  An d  we were a fr a id, he was ,  
he ran away fr om a big to
wn, came to survive in 
this village because the 
Germans, the Germans or  
the Rus sians , I don't know, did s o met hing to his pa
rent s, and when he wa s 
called to join the White 
Parti sans, he, we were afraid, t h
e risk, this __________ J e ws, and he c oul d not lie .  He was a ver y  

honest and not smart man.  
And we knew that he will 
tell, yes.  So every nigh
t we used to bring him 
into our hi di ng plac e a nd he us ed 
t o ________________.  
You ha ve t o go, obvious

Otherwise, they will kill yo
u.  But, if they will ask 
you, what will you tell them? 
_________________
, I will never say that.  I wi

we couldn't 
trust him. 
And every night we used to like
, bother him, what will you do? 
 And he kept saying, always 
crossing his heart and 
saying, cross my 
heart, I will not say, and he fi na
lly went and he 
did not.  He 
did not te ll t hat we ar e hi ding t here .  

Q: He c hec ked on 
you all the time?  
A: No, after he left  to the Partis
ans, he ne ver c a m e, we ne ver sa w 
hi m.  Now, I know where he i s

Sent hi m mone y, he is an engine er.  Very intell

A: Beca use  he wa s, ye

Q: Was he the one, 
wh o, oh, don't stop. 
A: Because the di fference from t his
 boy to t he other one s, t h e other 
ones  coul dn't e ve n sign t heir  
names.  They coul dn't wr

t own.  And he came becau

the fa mil y was se nt out s o mepl ace . 
 And he was intelli gent .  He use d
 to go wi th the polk(ph), how 
do you s ay i n English, pl ock( ph) , y

on t he  far m.   And he wa s 
goi ng wit h his book.  He  
was hol ding in one hand t he book, 
he was  studying hi ms el f, he  wa s

wa s wor kin g  in t he fi eld .   An d we al wa

the shepherd, t he shepherd couldn't ev

Q: And this is the co

A: Yes, of our

Q: Now, during all this time, how
 much infor mati on di d you have 
a bout the out side world and what  
wa s happe ni ng in the  ca mps?
  Di d you know anything? 
A: We did not know.  We didn't kn

Q: I do, but fir st, I want to know
 how you found out you

A: We c oul dn't, we coul

 didn't, e ver ythi ng 
was his, now one  
ti me  I got  si ck a nd my foot s welle d up ver y badl y 
a nd he  ca me  to vis it us a nd he al most faint ed  
when he looked at my
 foot.  Because I asked, wh
at will it be?  You have to
 kill me.  I can't run to 
hide .  It was  red and s w ollen.  And he sai d, I wi

fri ends, an old la dy that  her so
n was  a shoe ma ker  and he, we kne w hi
m.  And he t old her what ha d 
happened to me and she went to
 the river and picked some leav
es from the lilies,
 the white lily 
leave s and s he ga ve hi m to bring 
it to me.  And a piece 
of old linen a nd white fl our a nd she sai d, let  
her put on the leaves and this will take off the re
dness and the swelling a little  and then it will start  

itching, I shoul d put on.  He wa sn't
 satisfi ed that this can help me
.  He we nt t o the doctor i n  
As has hoc and he t old hi m t hat he knows t hat we
 are hi ding.  And the doctor was a Ger ma n , his  

na me was Leah( ph) , but he was, we
 kne w hi m, we kne w hi m.  It 's 
different with people that they 
know ever ybody.  
And he  said to me , he sai d, 
I wil l  give you an 
oint me nt and you ta ke it out to her .  
And he brought it to me  and 
my  foot healed up.  Othe
rwise, I, I said, the only
 survival, the only help 
we  coul d ha ve, I sai d, shoot  me.  Bec ause  I don't wa
nt other peopl e s hould get  kil led be caus e of me . 
Q: Do you t hink there was 
any di ffer ence i n your  experi ences because you wer e a girl  instead of a 
boy?  

A: No .  I wa s more h e lp than al mo
st a boy.  I could wash t he l aundr
y, I cut their hair with the not  
scissors, with the scissors
 they cut the sheeps, I wo
uldn't be able to hold it

A: No.  No.  We  were a

didn't have, for example, 
a dr ess to change.  An d 
there  was men a r ound, what 
do you do i f you ha ve t o

is.  Until it dries. 
Q: I me an , I 'm j ust c urio us, w o me n 
have things they have to take care of and then when you're in 
such unusual circumstances,
 it must  be  di ffi c ult .  
A: It, I don't know, we didn't fe el
 s o diffi cult .  The  onl y t hi ng what
 we , wh at was  di
fficult is when it 
wa s ver y col d.  And we did not ha

we wer e  all, we were  sleepi ng 10 
people  toget her. 
Q: Di d you have  your  per i od 
throughout this

A: For a long time  I didn'

a long time, maybe 
about a year and a

ack of onion and i f we ha d brea d, 
we us ed t o t a ke , that 's what we  us ed to eat , a  pi

and onion.  
Because there  
wa s no food, there wa s no, a bsol utel y
 nothi ng, especi ally for  us t hat
 we did not  want  to e a t me at .  
But by the end we, I and my
 mother, started to eat me

 di dn't ha ve enough.  
Q: C o mi ng  fro m a  h o me  that w a s ver

since I am from a farm, I 
have to know how to feed
 a cow, how to feed a ho
rse, how to milk a cow, 
how to work in the barn to make the grain come ou
t fr om, you know, you have 
to work with this.  I 
didn't know.  I got out at 
night a nd I 'm goi ng wit h 
them to fe ed the cows 
wit h a younger daught er  
beca use , obviousl y, s he 's, the  younger  da ughter is
 younger t ha n I a m, the  
daughter, but she knows 
what to do.  And I am afraid to 
go near the horse and I am afr aid 
to go near the cow.  The cow we 
had I woul d ma ybe c ope wit h it , but I  don't  know ho
w to milk a cow like they milk.  And I insi st I 
have t o le arn, I  ha ve  to do it .  So, it didn't ta ke  
long, ne xt day I  was fee ding 
the cow, I wasn't afraid 
for the hors e , I we nt to t he m in the morni ng t o th
e woods t o cut trees down
 for, because there wa s 
no men in the house, it was all wo
me n.  And young chil dre
n.  To c ut the tr ees, but I 'll t ell you, e ver y 
tree t hat I cut that gr ound
 was soaked wit h my tear
s.  This I rememb
er .  There was so much tear s in  
that forest that I tell, th
is is how we are, be cu
tting us down. 
 Like I should not cu
t the trees because  
why do I do it to the trees when 
we've been cut down like this?  Th
is I can, I don't , I never I thi n k  
repeat ed it , but I c ouldn't take t o c ut  down a tr
ee .  I couldn't.  And I wa s  goi ng a nd I  wa s cutt ing 
down the tree and I was crying b
itterly and ca me home an
d make dinner for them
.  I was there, and 
then on Sunday, I ha d to hide my
sel f  bec aus e the y were  alre a dy, 
the gir l  wa s pr ob
abl y 14, 15, a n d 
boys are coming.  And 
I was afraid to be there.  Maybe they
 will recognize that 
I'm Jewish.  So I 
used to tell them that I 
a m ver y sic k and I 'm ver y  tired and I 
use d to get  i nto t he bar n  and di g in 
mysel f all the wa y on t he  bott o m a

was  pa s sing from, walking fr om 
Vil na to Gor dna a nd t his  was on th

wit h mi l k and he was ve ry hungr y a nd he st oppe d an

beca use  he wa s, consta ntly people were passi ng by.
  And he  sai d, and a fter he at e he  sai d, oh, I  
haven't had a me al like this in 
a long time, who ma de that me
al?   And I heard hi m tal king, I  
disa ppe are d, of c our se , right a wa y from the house ,
 but I thought it over and I said, I'll never make  
another meal, th
ere was little bowls fr om
 potatoes with milk.  And, o
bviously, on the 
fa rms they did  
not ma ke  it.  That  was  a J e wi sh me
al .  And I never  did it a gai n.  I sai d
, no.  Until I did not, I was not 
secure there.  I thought something wi ll ha ppe n to me
 by t he end there.  Th
e r e was  too many pe opl e, 
I learned how to ma ke  the grai n, I learned ho

everything, I learned, and 
in a very short time, but I fe lt someda
y they will recognize
 that I am not 
doi ng like they are doing.  And we noti fie d hi m 
he shoul d come a nd pull me out, I ca nnot be by  
my sel f .  
Q: I n a sit ua tion li ke t hat , whe n you wer e se para
ted from your family, we
re you wor r i ed that you  
mi ght  not se e the m a gai n? 

A: Yes .  Ye s.  We n e ve r kne w wh
at  the hour ca n bring us.  We ne ver kne w about it .  Now, for  
example, when I l e ft t hat  place, 
I  ha d, a t  that ti me  I had a sack 
with some  clot he
s already.  He  
picked up, t his man picked
 up, I tol d  hi m where t hey wer e hi dde
n, but they were dr es sy clot he s, I  
coul dn't wear it anyway, there was w
ool dr esse d and I couldn't wear it . 
 I wasn't allowe
d to wear it. 
She told, and I wa s, when he came  to pick me  
up, she said, the clothes 
di s appeare d, some body ha d 
stole n the cl othe s.  Of c o urse , I did not bring up to 
a thing that's a tragedy, I said, okay, it's alright.  
To t he m it meant s o met hi ng, t o me 
it doe sn't even me an a nyt hi ng.  I l e
ft everythi ng, as l ong as I got  
out ali ve fr om t here.  Because 
I was sure I wil l  not get out  aliv
e fr om there.  After  that man 
recognized t hat the food is not the same and they ar
e comi ng in const antly, boys to t he girl a nd I  

disappear in that ti
me, by the end they will come 
out, who is she?  Wh o is 
she?  It's a mystery, I' m 
there a nd I 'm not there .  But ____________ thi n kin
g, I don't know, we di dn't, i f we woul d have the 
brains to think a lot, I think 
we should have commit 
suic ide .  And you kn
ow, nobody committed 
suicide, very little.  Unless they 
knew the Germans are go
ing to kill them, they
 were waiting for to  
be defi nitely killed.  Otherwise,
 there was very little suicide.  
But I was thinking
, why didn't we do 
it?   Why did we  ha ve  to s u ffer
?  Li ke this?  You'
re completely not a 
human being any mo re. 
Q: You must  ha ve  ha d a s t
rong will to

A: My br other, my brot her sai d 
he wants to be the one to tell th

Q: And then your younge r br other?  

A: My younger  br other  wa
s, oh, we were all a year  and t h r
ee-quarters.  My mom,  that 's what  
mamma, actually, I don't ev
e n know when I  was bor n.  I  just, Ya
ffa just got some 
docume nts so she  
will find out .  Because when I aske
d, when I came to the Unit ed St
ates, I asked my mot her, when i s  
the da te that  my birt hda y is?   She s aid, when we 
were all picking berries.  So I took it in June.  
Because this is the time that we pick berries. 
 Bec ause we, I had, s o me 
of my girlfriends had 
birthday part ies, not t oo ma ny, oc cas ionall y.  An
d I use d to c o me home a nd as k my mother , why  
can't we ha ve a birthda y party?   My mother use d  
to always s ay, you don't  have a fathe r , ther e 's no  
holi days.  She gave us  e veryt hing 
what we  wa nt ed a nd  we  h e lpe d i n

school a nd e xcuse mys el f at 12
:00 a nd be home and wor k in the 
busi ne s s.  My br others stoppe d

ness.  Everybody wa s helping.  We

when it came to holidays,
 she alwa ys let us

have re marri ed ve ry ea sil y, very e asil y.  But s he 
did not wa nt  anot her fat h er for us.  Because s he  
onl y li ved wi th hi m 10 ye ars.  And 
he  pass ed away from the epidemic. 
Q: Tell me  how libera
tion came about for you. 
A: We were sitting in a ba
rn and he came fr o m Ra
ddan that day.  And he 
said, the news is very  
good, beca use the ma yor used t o get  newspa per s.  
Now, he di dn't get a thi ng, beca us e he couldn't  
read a news paper a nywa y.  He woul
dn't, he didn't bring it t o us.  So
, but we heard at night, every 
night we us ed to hear a i rplanes running.  Beca us
e, as a matter of fact, 
Ya ffa 's mo t h er g o t, wa s  
pregna nt and she had a ba by.  And the y brought he r, 
they wer e hidi ng in the  hous e.  So they br ought  
her t o our  hi ding place  t o have  the baby.  And we 
di dn't know what to do 
with her.  Because the 
minute the baby will start cryi
ng, we have to hide, we have to, we
 are finished.  So that night he 
ca me fr om Ra dda n, that  Polish ma n,
 and my br ot her a nd he r father 
took t h e ba by, pick
ed it up in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0375  
50 
 
basket and we though
t, who is the righteous, wh
o is the best man in the 
villages around, and they 
took the baby and they we
nt t her e at  night  and t hey
 tied it up under the ceiling
 and they left  the baby 
and there was a note, 
ta ke  hi m to the  c hurc h and 
c h risten hi m.  And t he y we
re so fooli s
h, they, some 
of the pilot s, but we hear d ever y ni ght, Russ ian 
pl anes pas sing by.  Tha t  one of t he pil ots was a  
woma n a nd she ha d a ba by and the y 
droppe d the baby.  They did not 
think it is a Jewish baby.  And 

they raised the baby 
and the baby was okay
 until it got killed. 
Q: When you hear d t hese Russia
n pl a nes , did it gi ve you hope ? 
A: Hope.  We have, we ha
d hope, but we were afra
id for the day when they
 will come.  
We did not 
know, how can we get out and s
how our faces?  How can
 we  fa ce the world, ho
w ca n  we l oo k at  
people that they wanted to
 kill us?  That they robbed
 us.  For what?  I have so
me pictures that one of 
our wor kers  brought us in the ghetto and brought us
 to the ghetto.  He found the pi c t ures on the  
fl oor, whatever he found, he got 
into the house because we had a 
little dog and the dog didn't want  
to leave the house and cons
tantly sitting and 
crying.  So he came in to 
get a blanket, something fr om 
the house to take him to 
his house , a nd he found the pi ctur es a
nd he brought t he m t o t he ghett o to 
Ra dda n.  And we c oul dn't 
understa nd how can we go on livi ng to
 look a t  people that , some wer e  
good and he lped us, s o me just want e d to get ri d of
 us .  That wa s the hardest part t hat we di d not  
know how we will survive, 
how we can go on in
 life.  And that, we didn't th
i nk it will  be so fa st, but  
that ni ght a l ot of ai rpla nes were pas s i ng a bove us
.  And he c a me i n, he c a m
e home  tha t  ti me.  And 
he ca me int o  our barn and he s h
owed us that in case they bomb an
d the barn catches on fire, t her e 
wa s insur anc e, so t he  gra ss wa s hi
gh, he t ook out  a rock
 from the, and we shou
ld get through there 
and run to the fiel ds .  Thi s is what he prepared 
for us.  On Sat u rday morn
ing, afternoon, we see the 
Ger mans are coming int o  the vill age and starti ng to
 stati on t he ms elve s.  Put up their e q uipme nt, t o  
put  the fe nce, and I thought,
 here, this is the day that
 we are dyi ng.  We got  
to, we lived to and that 
is the date we are going to
 die.  Because no way w
ill we survive.  The villag
e will catch on fire, we 
have no plac e to run.  We can r un t h
r ough the gra ss, but that will be 
hot, t oo.  But that 's the e nd of  
us.  In about half, they had just 
started like you put out now, the equi
pment, they star
ted to settle and 
in no ti me c a me an or de r they ha ve t o leave .  They
 left, they were about, 
they stationed themselves

 from there and in about half an hour
 we saw all the village there is on 
fir e .  It 's bur ning.  This wa s luc k, t hi s wa s luc
k, you ha ve to call it fate .  
That was luck.  And of  
cour se, next morni ng we kne w that 
they are all gone.  That for  us was t he end of the war but w e  
were afraid to go to town.  We di
dn't know what to do.  But we knew 
if we will stay longer and they 
will think that he has Jews in the 
house, we'll be killed 
there fr om the Wh ite Po

and Ya ffa 's father , t hey went t o As has hoc  be cause
 it was onl y t hree kil o met ers we were hidi ng fr o m  
As has hoc.  And t hey went ther

imagining the town with 
Jews, without my friends, without

Of course, there's nothing there. 
 We  bought some lumb

and I s ee li ghts  c o ming up a nd i t 's  so be auti ful and 
no w l i fe  i s  fi ni sh ed,  my  l i fe espe ci al l y  i s

Bec ause I know I 'm l yi ng.  And s h e tells me , what

Q: And you?  

A: And I was very di sa ppointe d. 
 I  had se vera l boyfrie nds  t here . 
 And I was disa

there is different languages.  Ever

 a bout a not her way but to get  to

they have to have si

There was no lights, nothin

No food, the packages we got, they

and it was ve ry not good. 
 We felt like we had, ar e

agreed with us, he will go

just like this, and I told  
him, in the daytime 
I will wash your clothes, 
what we had there.  A

  We  weren't afraid to go at

 He'll remai n a te

 But, maybe to ha

to dream, some day, maybe. 
 I did not, I was a pessimist.  I didn'

't interested in the papers or so
mething, as long as
 he can go on 
worki ng a nd get out on our own, not

wh y don't you give the ba

was impossible in '49, '4 8, 
'49, to find a place to

 And we s ta rted our li fe on our own.

Be caus e we c o uld ha ve gone to Ar ge nt ina and have  the brot her. 
That 's all he wa nte d, t o have a br

how ca n you dri ve on

Q: Something that I'm al
wa ys curi ous about.  Y

difficulty and trauma  
beca use you wer e Je wi sh.  Some  
pe ople like t he man who 
went  into Russi a, probabl y de cide d the y  
didn't  want  t o be Je wi
sh any more.  For you 
this was import ant? 
A: For me it was important.  And 
our children, from the 
first possibility they co
uld do, were brought 
up in Ca mp ________
___, for exa mple the year t h
at my mother die d, I t
hought I cannot send the m 
to Ca mp ___________
, we di d not have the money.  Bec aus
e the hospit al and the burial and the 
debt  of my mother  wa s abs olu
tely outrageous fo r 
me.  I didn't think I 
can cope with it. 
Q: What year was that? 
A: 1961.  And t he r abbi ca me t o 
vi sit  us and my brot hers  fle w i n
 fr om Brazil a nd he aske d me , a r e 
the childre n goi ng to ca mp?   And I 
said t o the r abbi , I don't know wh

don't keep them away be cause 
they wa nted, the y wante d , t hey liked t o le arn. 

Q: Why wa s religi on so i mporta nt  to 
you?   Or why is  it , I  should s ay. 

A: We  di dn't know a ny other  wa

cause we suffered
, I was once in  
the hospital after surgery in, it wa

a pri est t here , a nd he ca me and he
 star ted to talk to me.  You su
ffered so much, 
I under stand, why  
don't you become a Ca t
holic a nd you won't ha ve ever y to 
suffer from religion.  And I said , 
something about it, th

about t he r eli gion.  We ar

I like  t he r eli gion a nd I want t o be , I  want t o r e mai n

Because she felt al ways sorry that  
here we have a nice , ver y modest 
home , very mo dest .  Beca use we di

looked, we had to support my ne
phew i n I srael  because he was 
by hi ms el f.  And he did nee d  
support .  And we felt li ke not hing means t o us 
but to educate the childre

learn Hebr ew and even my husba
nd was teaching them Hebr ew at 
night.  But t he y did not ha ve 
enough respect to study with him.  
So the y use d t o fall asle ep on the tabl e beca use it di dn't, it 's bet t e r 
to play fo otball than to st

A: I always see the Pole s  standi ng in fr ont of my hou
se.  I see it all the time. 
 Da y and night.  Thi s  
doe s not go awa y from me .  I see 
the Ger man when he came and I to
ok off my watch.  I see the day 
that I was s ent out t o hi de by 
mysel f, because it  seems like I wa
s wit h my  mot her  or with  my 
brot her , one of t hem, be
cause we were al ways i n di fferent 
places, but I  had so
mebody wit h me. 
And I that , a s I said, in It aly, when 
my landlady used to te ac h us to be free , not t o be a fraid, but it  
still was a fear for us.  Very much. 
 But I thought, United 
States, in this time 
that we came is s o  
lucky, I was sure that 
___________ are dyi ng fr om 
hunger because nobody dri nks here.  Nobod y  
steals here .  We use d to go to my nie ce, wal k, 12
: 00 at ni ght , 11: 00 at ni ght, in t he mi ddle of da y, 
whenever we used t o walk bet ween t he two niec

re only two houses, o n  
Sawyer Street, Beverlyw
ood(ph) was not built yet.
  And we want to __
___, we were free. 
Q: Let me  ask you one more
 questi on.  Certa in val ues  that  you 
learned as a child fr om your  mot her , 
they really stick with you and, 
not only may t he y help you t hroug
h all of this, it was the way you 
lived a ft er you were  free ?   Ce rtain 
thi ngs  that a re i mporta nt  to you?  
A: Givi ng.  Hel p pe opl e.  To hel
p.  And it was upon a ti me 
t hat when we survi ved, that  I said, I will  
never hel p peopl e.  Beca use fr om cer tain pe ople, wh
i ch I don't  wa nt to me ntion, we di d not , we ha d 
a little di sappoi nt ment.  And, but , i f you l ear n it at home from c h
ildhood, it won't go away fro m 
you.  I love  to hel p pe ople.  And I love t o do 
for pe opl e.  And I ' m known 
here in the building. 
That 's  why it  hel ps  me now t o pul l 
through the debt of my
 husband.  I have he
re  fa mil y,  so me  ha ve  
mo ve d away, they we nt to retirement places.  But 
I am like the sister, some
 says  I 'm t he i r moth er,  
some tell me I am their doctor.  
I a m, I live ver y close t o the pe ople  and I love pe ople.  I c annot  
leave t o see t o one eveni n g that 
I woul d get craz y.  After my husba

I sai d I  ha ve  to l ear n t o l i ve by mysel f .  And, 
but to go, anybody that cal

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0375

I 'm goi ng, a nd the y t hink a bout me  
and they care about me . 
 This is the whole idea, they care about  
me .  
Q: What yea r di d 
your husba nd die?  
A: In 1992.  Fo ur years,
 on the Fourth of July. 

Q: When you c a me over here , did you op
enl y t alk about your e xperi enc es?  
A: Not to o mu ch .  I 
talk  no w more t han I u s ed t o .  No w i f 
we  come together, we al ways fi nd a wa y 
to talk about survival. 
 Unless my  friend is up
 here .  And t ell the m t hi ngs .  And e verybody is  
interested.  I t 's funny.  
Everybody wants t o know.  It 's  not, t h
ey are not running away because I t ell  
them.  And I fo und it necessary that
 they should know b
ecause a lot of people are telling me that we  
lived here a nd we di dn't  know wh
at you got t hrough.  We
 di dn't know what wa
s going on in this 
world.  We  wer e bus y, we  ha d s mal l chil dre n, we 
were  bus y and we ne ve r kne w what  wa s goi ng on 
in Europe.  We didn't know a bout 
the war that much.  So this is 
i mport ant  that the y shoul d know.  
And it 's not hing to be a sha me d, 
we didn't choose it.  This is the 
i dea .  And my ch
il dren want t o  
know a bout i t.  And 
my  grandchildren. 
Q: Was it easy to 
tell them about it? 
A: In t he be ginning it wasn't eas y.  
But later on we did.  But we s
till, I don't think we told the m 
ever ythi ng.  I don't t hink we t old the m e ver ythi n
g.  Because my husband al
ways us e d to see , he  
said, I was l ocked up in a buildi ng a nd I sa w the  way they put my wi fe and chil dre n on the tr uck.  

Now, I did get this, true. 
 But I, because when
 my sister got killed we we
re in very big danger, so 
we didn't grieve even as
 much, because we knew th
at we are going to be k
illed, too.  
Didn't think 
any othe r wa y.  But he al wa ys s aid it in his , a nd he
 always wa s screa ming at night.  I , I  don't think 
there  was  a night  whe n I  didn't  ha ve  t o wa
ke hi m up, Nor man, wh
y are you screaming? 
Q: For ma ny years? 

A: For ma ny, many years.  For ma
ny years .  It never went a w a y fr
om him.  Because he saw things  
that, we maybe were scar ed, but he 
saw it, he saw it.  There was shoo
ting in front of him, they wer e  
shooting people.  And even in the 
Par tisans, bei ng one  Je w tha t  he 
could ha ve bee n kill e d.  He was  
one  Je w in t he Russi an a r my.

Q: You've  been ver y gr a cious with
 your ti me .  Is there anythi ng el
s e you want t o add a n d the n we 'll  
fi ni s h ?  
A: No mor e  war s.  No more war s
.  But the Polish know 
that t hey di d cont ribute  a l ot t o our a gony  
and killing and everythi
ng.  They did.  They should not say that
 they did not.  Not 100%, but a very 
small percentage.  When the Poli
sh ma n ca me t o us, I went  into
 a ______ once wit h hi m and he  
said, see, they tell that Polish people did not help. 
 Her e , he hi msel f sai d, ma ybe one or t wo perc ent ,  
ma ybe less.  This is sad because 
we lived with them and we coul
d live in harmony and everything. 
Thi s is  a  de e p, why?   Why?   Beca us
e we  were  b or n J e
ws?  So , that's... 
Q: Thank you.
