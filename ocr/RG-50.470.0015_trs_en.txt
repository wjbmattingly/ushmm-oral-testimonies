WI LLIAM MCWO RKMAN: Perhaps I should start 
by saying that I was in the 12th armored 
division--one of several armore
d divisions in  the 3rd and 7t
h Ar my who drove south toward 
Austria. Our original  mi ssion as Munich, but and 
OSS agent who we had sent forward  earlier in 
the week, we found from the Munich burgermeister 
or  ma yor that they were going to give up the 
city without a fight,  so our mi ssion was changed so 
we headed more to the south and the  east on 
the west side of Amersee down through--our obj
ective was,  initial objective was Weilheim, 
Weilheim and from Wei l heim we  were to go 
down through Oberau, thence into Innsbruck and 
finally  down to Brenner Pass where we were to 
hopefully finish the war at  that point. Things 
were very confused both on the German side and 
 in the American and British side. We changed 
mi ssions quite  often. We had usually three columns of ar mo r moving down south  parallel to 

each other di stanced by several miles. And I was 
with  the division artillery commander, Col 
Geldart, as we moved south  fr
om Augsburg toward Lech and the 
town of Landsberg. We  didn't   
know that the camps were there as we  came down th
rough there, but  we finally crossed the Lech 
river and mo st of the camps were from  Landsbe
rg strung up through the village of Kaufering a 
few  kilome t e rs to the north. And we entered 
camp no. 4 I found out  later the number of that, 
and with I wa s with a group of about of  ten 
people, I think, from the 
division artillery although 
other  me mb ers of the division were there. And 
I had some  i mpressions of  our move ment into 
that area. The first one wa s utter horror at  what
 we saw. There must ha ve been piled of 4- 600 
bodies piled in  one part of the camp as we en
tered. Another pile was burning.  Some  of the low 

shacks in which the poor prison
ers lived,  supposedly living, ha
d the door locked with the 
prisoners inside  and set fire and these were 
just a ma ss of charred bodi
es, still  burning, the 
stench was awful. I think one of the big impression
s  that I first had as we came in was that the 
blueness of their  skin. They had been so star
ved and so emaciated that the skin hue  was a 

definite blue and looked like a chic
ken after it had been  picked and ready to boil. Some  of the 
bodies were burning back in  other parts of th
e camp. We saw various 
buildings in various  
stages of disrepair and burning. We  saw what appear
ed to be  German guards in the area, and, of 
course, these were being  surrounde
d by allied troops as they come  into the camp. In  effect, it 
was not a capture of the camp as it was an over  
running of the camp. We  ha
d no resistance as we 
came up there.  One of the things that I reme mbe r  pa
rticularly was an S, what  later turned out to 
be an SS guard who had changed his uniform  fr
om his SS suit into civilian clothes who was 
standing knee deep  in bodies 
out there with allied troops more
 or less surrounding  him. I found 
out later from the Holocaust people that they ha
d  identified this guard who the next day had 
been killed by a  prisoner who had just had 
enough I think, and took a 
board and  hit him over 
the head and killed him. We weren't there for that 
 event, but I think it ha
ppened quite frequently 
throughout the  camp. Al so, you must  reme mber that
 the as these camps 
were  overrun in the 
Landsberg/Kaufering area, ma ny of the prisoners  
either escaped or were
 released through open 
gates and we re  wandering down the road and some  
of the most pitiful sights we  saw were these 
inma tes in all stages of undress with striped  paja
ma s on or with with very 
little clothes on at all, 
wandering  down the road in a very dazed and 
glazed-eye  condition. They  begged for food, they 
weren't sure who we The y were told that we 
 were American troops and seemed overjoyed. Back 
to the camp for a  mo me nt, we were particularly 
impressed with the joy with which  they greeted 
the American troops. One of the people in my group  was a Jewish ma ster sergeant, or operations 

sergeant, Dick  Mansen, who very fortunately had received a box 
of ma tzoth bread,  or ma tzoth 
crackers that day or in the previous day's ma il. 
he  had those with him and he went aside to a 
group who was standing  there a
nd distributed these ma tzoth bread
 or ma tzoth crackers to  the 
Jewish prisoners there and to a ma n they were cr
ying because  it was the first matzoth bread that 

they had seen in five years  or however long th
ey had been in the camp. It was a very, very  
emotional and moving thing. The horror 
of it hit us even  af
terwards as much as it did as we saw 
them there. But the the  prisoners were well-behav
ed, one of the key problems that we had  as we 
entered this camp when others did who they en
tered their  camp, was the disease problem. We  
knew that people under those  conditions must ha ve
 been suffering from typhus as well as ma ny  
ma ny other diseases, and we were told to be very 
careful and not  get too 
close to them or touch 
them even though our natural huma n  inclination 
was to see what we could do to ma ke them 
comfortable.  In some  cases they had been give
n blankets and K rations and C  rations from our 
supplies to cover up those who were
 still eh  uncovered so to speak. It wa a cold wet day, as I 
recall, and  even with our uniforms and jacket
s we were uncomfortable, and you  can imagine 
what the poor prisoners suffered in that same  ve
in. I  talked to a friend of mi ne from the 493rd 
fi eld artillery  battalion w
ho was in one of the efforts moving south parallel to  us, Pe te Bramble, 
and he me ntioned the fact that his wi re truck 
 pulled up to a camp which 
had evidently not been 
entered at all,  and the first thing they saw were 
barbed wire fences so they hit  their truck, took 
their carbines and machine guns, mo ved forward  in
 there and found out what the situation was. 
Prisoners came  up  and kissed thei
r trousers and one of the most 
me mora ble  recollections that 
either Pete or one of those wire crews was  
that some one stood at the edge of the camp and 
saluted them which  really was an emotional thing for these American soldiers who had  never 
seen this kind of mi streatme nt 
of people in their lives.  Gene
ral Allan, the division commander of 
the 12th entered the  camp while I was there,and wa
s as shocked as we were to see the  realism 
of what these camps were. And later in the da
y, I  understand that he ordered that all ma le 
villagers from the  nearby village, and I can't  
tell you which village it was because  there were 
several around , but he had them walk through the 
 camp. look at all of the things, from the ovens 

to the burning  huts in the ground 
to the stacks of bodies, to the liv
ing people  and he had them 
bury the bodies the next day that ev
ening in the  next day with th
eir bare hands, which they did. I 
don't recall  that they took the wome n of th
e village through the camp, and I  can understand 
why. That evening, we were told, the burgermeister
  or the ma yor of the little village shot him 
self. Most of the  village observers who went 
through claime d that they didn't even  know that 
the camp wa s there. We  found that di fficult to be lieve  because in ma ny cases you could see the 

wire fences from the  village. But we ran into a 
lot of this denial as we called it as  we went 
through other camps and through that part of Germa
ny. All  kinds of diffe rent incidents occurred. 
Many people were there at  the camp before I arrive
d, so mi ne is a very poignant observation  of 
the camp, but I didn't, I wasn't  the first one in, 
so I don't  know what actually happened as the 
first troops arrived.  Sandy: ,,and 
also of your fellow service me n. 
 

WI LLIAM MCWO RKMAN: That is one
 thing that I did forget. Y
ou know,  I eh, I'll start with 
that maybe. 

 

Sandy: Yeah, that's fine. 

 

WI LLIAM MC WO RKMAN: OK. Ok. 

 

Sandy: Just wait, just a sec. 

 

WI LLIAM MCWO RKMAN: One of the things that
 was most noticeable was  the color and 
countenance and appearance of the prisoners  th
emselves. I do reme mber that most of them 

appeared to me  to  have almost blue skin, very
 little circulation, starva
tion,  riding only on bones 
and no flesh and the st ench was awful, the  appe arance of their eyes was gl azed. They couldn't 
believe what  they were seeing, and eh their voice
s were weak. We  did talk to  several of them. 
They were overjoyed, tears were running most of 
 their faces, but these men were in not a normal 
condition, they  were far worse. I would have guesse
d that the ma jority of them  ranged in weight 
from maybe 70 pounds up to 80 or 90 at the most. 
 Very few people did we see who weren't pure 
skeleton with skins  stretched over the top. Anothe
r very impressive thing 
about the  environment 
or the ambiance of that meeting was the careful  s
ilence of Americans, we talked in whispers to 
each other. And it  was almost like being at 
a wake which it was was ma ny thous,  thousands 
times enlarged. And the emotions the Americans 
were  very very noticeable as we sat there 
talking to the inma tes and 
 among ourselves as we ll. 
 

Sandy: Tell me  about the SS? 
 
WI LLIAM MC WO RKMAN: The primary German we 
saw in this gr oup was an  what later 
turned out to be an SS soldier 
guard who had changed  his clothe
s into civilian clothes, had a 
black vest on and we  took his picture, which turned out very well. He was standing  knee-deep 

in bodies which were not burning but were stac
ked up  ready for burning. And I would imagine 
those bodies came up above  his knees and he was st
anding there talking to himself a little  bit, 
kind of muttering, professing his 
innocence and he had his  head shaved like an SS trooper 
would. We  were told by Holocaust  people who got
 some  history on him that he was killed the 
next  day by an inma te prisoner who hit him with
 a board after months  
of being mi streated and 
killed him. So it was just rewards for  his wonde
rful work for the Nazi Reich. Is that enough?     

Sandy: Yeah. One other thing. Talk to me  about
 what you thought  you and 
the other servicemen 
could or couldn't do. 
 

WI LLIAM MCWO RKMAN: As we viewed this terr ible
 scene, I think most  of us did think of 
what we could do to relieve the situation. Our  ba
ttalion surgeon was with us and he said: Do not 
feed, overfeed  these people imme diately. They won'
t be able to take it and it'll  possibly kill 
some  of them. So we were very 
careful. We  did give  them K rati
ons with the admonition to treat 
it carefully and and  not try to eat very much at
 a time. There were already people  arriving from 
some  of the rear echelons who took these people 
 attempted to segregate them into those who 
were in dying  condition and those who were a 
little bit bette
r and so forth and  so on. We 
reme mber one building was ma rked contagious dis
eases.  And of course, we stayed away from 
that at the mo me nt and later  people came in and ma
de just triage of what should be done with  
those people. It appeared to be an enormous 
problem and it  appeared even more so as we 
learned of the extent of these camps  and th
e deprivations that the prisoners had undergone 
during  that. 

 

Sandy: One other thing that you me
ntioned to Diana was the  e
xpression on the faces even in 
death. 

 

WI LLIAM MCWO RKMAN: Yes, eh, the expressions 
on the faces of the  dead people was one 
of pain, horror, a few of relief, ma
ny of  them were beaten to deat
h, but particularly the grotesque  
countenances of those who had been put in thes
e long pit housing  with 
a wooden roof over the 
top and locked the door and then set  on fire. Y
ou could see them crawling to the edge, you could 

see a  hand clawing its way, tryi ng to claw its wa
y out of that pl ace.  And you can imagine what 
kind of a death that mi ght have been.  This wa
s appeared on all of them
. A reaction that I had 
after I  left the camp wa s that we were so s
hocked by the appearance of
  the hundreds of bodies 
that were in here, stack of ma ybe 5 or 6  hundred
 in one spot, and 3 or 4 hundred in another, was 
that we  were so aghast that I think we  spent mo
re time looking at that  than we did at trying to 
take imme diate care of the those who  were liv
ing. As I look back on it 50 years later, I would 
have  spent more of my time tryi
ng to comfort more of the living and  trying to find out if they 
knew of any of their particular friend  who we
re there and so forth but we didn't do that. We  
were all so  shocked by the .....
