Now, what happened i n t he peri od bet ween 1939 and 1942 was  t he fact  t hat  t he J ewi sh

You coul d s ee a hors e and a cow on t he t hi rd fl oor bal cony because t hes e

T h er e th ey p u t  a b ar b ed  w i r e an d cal l ed  i t  a gh et t o .
T
h i s  w as a gh et t o  
but not in the idea of a ghetto like in W arsaw, this was a ghetto, this was a settlement of 

J ews  whi ch were s urrounded by barbed wi re and 
cons t ant l y
 
w at ch ed  s o  t h er e w as n o  w ay

The peopl e t hat  wat ched, t he s ol di ers  t hat  wat ched t he gh

That  s t ate of affai rs  l as t ed from  Apri l  '42 unti l  Novem ber '42.
 
I was still 
wi t h m y parent s  and I was  st

In that little place we still managed to go 
out  a l i t t le bi t  becaus e we were young, and t hat 's  when I m et  m y pres ent

or how di d
 
you m anage t o keep hi m  hi dden wi t h you?
 
You had t o work 
--
 
 

A:
 
OK.
 
At the times I just described, I was still with my parents, so we were still together, and 
we s t i l l  had s om e m eans  t o buy s om e food on the bl ack m arket .
 
S o m y brother was  m y 
responsibility
, becaus e up unt i l  t hat  m oment  I was  s t i l l  hom e and m y parent s  cared for m e.
 
I 
even m anaged t o go out  for ice cream , not  l at e i n t he eveni ng, but  we had a l i t t l e garden 

nex t to the little house where we lived and the Germans made sure that the J ews tilled 
t h e 

s oi l  and grew s om e fl owers  becaus e t hey had to s how t o t he Int ernat i onal  R ed C ros s how

And every m orni ng at  s i x  o'clock we woul d be t aken 
out  t hrough a gat e t o work and t aken t o work i n t he ci t y on buses and t ruck

And every day 
at  s i x  o'clock, t hey woul d bri ng us  back, and t hen t here was  curfew.
 
S o that was the life that 
summer.
 
Now, not far away from this little village was the concentration camp,

But that was happening all the time.
 
S o i t  was  on t he

And we kind of had a feel i ng that  
this is the end of this little settlement of the J ews, because we heard r
um ors  that J ewi s h

S ome people had little

And that's where this janitor really got the idea that something's going

But  once thi s  was  over wi t h, t hey al l  had t o go t hei r own way.
 
W hile I had this little

You l i ved for a l ong t i m e Azonari an (ph) Tel l m e what

A:
 
W el l , l i ving Az onari an (ph) act ual l y di dn't  do anyt hi ng for m e, becaus e t he way I was  

brought  up, I al ways  knew who I was .
 
My family was not religious.
 
M y f ath er  w as  t h e 
founder of a Zi oni s t  yout h movem ent  i n m y hom etown.
 
I al w ays  k n

I al w ays  
had hol i days .
 
I went  t o a J ewi s h hi gh s chool  where Hebrew was t aught  everyday.
 
I w a s  
am ong J ewish peopl e, J ewi s h fri ends , and I al ways  knew who I was.
 
I coul d have never l os t  
m y i dent ity, and I was  fort unat e t o m arry s om ebody of m y own faith.
 
Now, j us t t o gi ve you 
an ex am ple, I had fri ends , who at  m y age, 14, 15, were al s o i n t he s am e s i t uat i on t hat  I was .
 

But  t hey s om ehow found P ol i sh m at es , who m aybe at  t hat  t i m e were hel pi ng t hem  t o hi de.
 

They never went  back t o J udais m  or went  back t o bei ng J ewi s h, and I cannot , I'm  not  t he 

j udge for them .
 
I cannot  blam e t hem  for t hat .
 
But  t hi s  i s  what  happened t o m any peopl e.
 
Thi s  i s  what  happened t o a lot  of m al es  who m arri ed Gent i l e wom en, who were hel pi ng

That  happens  t o

It  was  j us t t hat  everyt hi ng el s e was  j us t  done out  of need.
 
If I had t o go t o church, i t 
m ean t  
not hi ng t o m e.
 
If I had t o be arrogant , i t  meant  not hi ng t o m e.
 
To me it was only a 
m eans  of survi val , and I was fort unat e enough not  t o have t o cont i nue t hi s  fal s ehood and get  

back t o mys el f t o be whoever I am .

For i ns t ance, I

I was  j us t s o us ed t o i t  al ready, t hat  I
 
modified it a little bit and kept my Hebrew name

But  i t 's  very unfort unat e t hat  I have t o s ay
