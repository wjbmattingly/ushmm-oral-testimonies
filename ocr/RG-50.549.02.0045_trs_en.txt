Q: -- projects of the museum, so some of 
what we™re going to talk about today will 
overlap with that. But th
e main subject we want to talk ab out is sort of what your life was 
like from the time of liberation,
 all the way up until today. 
A: Okay . 
Q: So, in cluding, if you went to the store yesterday, wh at did you buy? 
A: Okay, so I should 
start to talk, yes? 
Q: Yeah, well, you know, we™ll go back  to the end of th e war, I mean, the f -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- first thing just to cover was, I understa
nd from your history that you were actually in 

several camp s during the war. 

A: During the war, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Which -- 
A: From Au schwitz we went to Gross-Rosen, 
to Ravenbreek, and to  the end in  Neustadt -
- Neustadt-Mechlenborg, we lived a coup
le months til the wa
r finished, yeah.  
Q: And when the war was endi
ng, right at that period -- 
A: When  the war was ending, when  we were lib
erated, we tried to head back to Poland. 
There was a lot, how you call it? Mins, explos
ive, underground. On e of my  friend died  
from that. She pulled a pi
a to ma ke a piece of bread, and sh e right away with a shrapnel. 
So, we decided to leave Germany, we went b
ack to Poland. That was a mistak e, because 
in Poland were very bad.

Q: Let me ask you first -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- at the end of the wa
r, which camp were you in? 

A: Which camp I was? Beside the ghetto, in  
the camp, I was in Bi
rkenau, in Auschwitz 
since 1942, til 1945. But in the Dead March, when the Russian was 
behind, we have to 
run together with the Germans.  

Q: And when the Ru ssians were coming, 
which camp  were you in  at that point? 
A: No, that was the Russians and the American came in the same day. That™s in Neustadt-

Mechlenborg, the same day. They both came in 
the same  day, yes. And then  we tried to 
head back 
to  Po land . 
Q: What -- What had the conditions been lik
e in that camp? What was going on in the 
weeks that was leading up to liberation? 
A: You mean in Birkenau? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Mm. When we came, we have to start to 
build the camp, because was just the electric 
wiring all around half. We haven™t got no wate
r, no nothing. It was like a lot of malaria, a 
lot of camp -- a lot of sickness, because was --
 they make the camp from a farm, so we 
hardly could work, it was still [indecipherable]
, the ground. And I was there til 1945, in 
the same camp, very close to the crem
atorium, just a couple steps away.  
Q: Did you -- did you have mu ch
 of a sense of how the war 
was going, that things had 
turned against the Germans? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

A: No, we didn™t know nothi
ng ab out it. If they find a pencil, or a piece of paper on 
somebody, right away  they hang the person. So
, we didn™t know noth
ing wi -- but we saw 
the planes running above, but we
 didn™t know nothing of what
™s going on.  That -- that™s 
the way it was, until we came to Germany, we
 realized that the 
war was coming to an 
end. It™s going to take -- but every day, 
people were dying anyw
ay, from hunger. Every 
minute, actually. 
Q: What was it that -- that made you realize 
the war was ending soon? Wh at did you see? 
A: What did we see? Because the German 
starts to go away 
from Poland, from the 
camps, and come closer to Germany, over th
ere, in the other camp . There was no place 
anyway, to run anyway, 
because all the camp was fu -- fill
ed. So we was tha -- we didn™t 
even know when  the war fi
nished, because I tell you how 
we find out. Near us was 
[indecipherable] from pilo
ts, where the Germans shot down. 
French pilot, English pilot. 
We didn™t speak English, but th
ey cut the wires, a
nd they told us we 
are free, because the 
German ran away from the cam
p, they locked  up, and we didn™t know th e war was over, 
either, but we understood what™s happened. 
They  went out, and we went out, and we 
started to run to  the houses to get some f ood. But all the houses was empty, not with 

food, with people, beca
use they were sure when we came
 out in the camp, they going to 
kill them. So they just
 -- they left all the 
-- in the whole city was empty houses, th-the 
Germans run away. 

Q: What -- when -- when 
they cut the wires -- 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

Q: -- and they said, you know, you™re free -- 
A: Yeah. Over there was not electric wires. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not in this -- in Auschwitz was electric wi
res, not over there. They told us that we 
start to run for food, that™s the first thing,
 whatever we saw, sugar on a wagon, any -- 
anything wh at we could eat, we started to ea
t, because for six years we were starving to 
death, really. 
Q: But at the -- at the moment that
 that happened, and you realized -- 
A: Yeah. We -- 
Q: -- the war™s over, we™re free, do you rememb
er -- did -- anything people said to each 
other, or how did -- do yo
u remember your own emotions at that time? 
A: Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn™t 

happy, we lost everybody. But 
we didn™t know what to do
, actually. It -- it wasn™t 
organized, nothing was organized, we just was 
running from one city to
 the other, and we 
wouldn™t know what we going to do, where we
 going to end up. It wasn™t yet order -- we 
made a mistake, we went back
 to Poland, that was all. We
 couldn™t go back  to Germany 
later. So a lot of people who stayed in Germ
any, they  organized th em, and they got help . 
We didn™t have any help in Po land. I came
 back to my city, a
nd I went up to the 
government to ask for help, we were 10 girl
s. So he gave us the key from the school, 
where we was finishing school, that build ing 
belonged to a Jewish
 family, but they -- 
they got killed. So I to
ld them, ﬁHow about fo
od?ﬂ He said, ﬁNothing else. Just stay.ﬂ So 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

we were sleeping on the floor, and we were 
starving, actually. We didn™t have wh at to 
eat. It was horrible. So, after a couple week
s, so me p e o p le fro m my
 town came back to 
the city, and he told  us that we shouldn™t stay
 there, because they already killed four girls 
that went in -- in a hiding place there. Th
e Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and 
one was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, 
they tried to kill them
. So the -- the life was 
very danger in Poland. So he 
says, ﬁDon™t stay in that city
, you™re going to be caught -- 
killed. You better come to Lódz, to a big city
 there are kibbutzim there, they™ll take you 
in.ﬂ So we were happy to have [indeciphera
ble] had, and a piece of bread. You could 
only stay six months. We have to smuggle ou
rselves to Israel. So I -- I knew I had a 
brother in Russia, I was already in contact with
 him, so I didn™t want to go, I want to 
wait. So they send me to another kibbutz, in
 Bialystok, to  stay another six mo nth. We 
stood there a couple months, in this -- and th
ese, the Polish people was very angry, they  
didn™t want the Jews back. So one night th
ey came in, th e police,
 and they give us 
ammunition, they going to  attack us, going to
 be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself, 
we can do nothing about it. So five people went
 to [indecipherable] on the train. We tried 
to pull out from Bialystok. Four
 of them got killed, they to
ok them down from the train, 
18 - 19 year old. What -- Hitler 
let them live, but the Polish
 wouldn™t let them live. One 
was  hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in th e train, so he surviv ed. So he craw led 
back, and he told us to pick
 up the bodies. So, 
when I saw that, in time my brother came 
in, so I pick up my  brother, and I says
, ﬁI™m n o t staying here. I™m going to 
[indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking
 out the people,ﬂ because they says it™s a

graveyard in Poland.. When we
 went out on the street, and 
we saw dead people, dead 
Jews, they wasn™t missed by 
nobody, their families was kille
d a couple years ago in th e 
camps, and they came back from 
Russia. So they go
t killed in Poland.
 So I took my 
brother, and I went on the trai
n. We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me, 
ﬁYou know, they took down yesterday, Jews, 
and they killed them.ﬂ
 Like she gave me 
the idea that I™m going to be killed too, in a 
couple hours. So I almost
 fainted. Finally, we 
reach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted. 
I couldn™t take it any longer. So I find out 
that the Bricha organized people -- actually
, they organized peopl
e who came back from 
Russia. Russia let in a half a million Jews. So
 the older people -- so I got together with 
them, and we start to go -- the 
Jewish agen cy made up with American government that 
Czechoslo vaki should let us in, out from Pola
nd. It was like a couple thousand people. I 
was the only one with a number, actually. 
So, we went to Czechoslovakia. In 
Czechoslo vakia we stood overnigh
t, and we have to go to 
Au stria, and th ey prepare 
camps for us. We came to Austria, a fe
w thousand people. Th
e people who should 
provide us with bread, sold th
e flour, and we didn™t have nothi
ng to eat, we have to run in 
the field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat.
 That was after the war, in 1946. In time, I 
met my  husband, because he had a couple brothe
rs in Russia, in the 
army. So he told the 
Russian people coming back fro
m Russia, maybe one of his br
others will survive. None 
of them survived, they
 all got killed. So I met my hus
band, so he says to me, ﬁH ow 
comes a number? It™s mostly 
people with the Russian.ﬂ So  I told him I was waiting for 
my  brother, he™ll -- til he came
 back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland.

We have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to
 the Bricha. So my  husband told  me that he 
got papers to go to the United 
States in a month, a cousin sent him papers. But if I marry, 
two people can go on the same
 cer tificate . I di dn™t even know my husband, to be honest 
with you. I decided, wh at do I 
got to leave? Israel is closed the doors, you couldn™t go to 
Israel anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves
. The people who went there, went to 
Cyprus, you know. I didn™t have where to go
, I was hungry. My  husband, when  he was 
liberated, he didn™t live this town. So the 
UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and 
they gave him three meals a da
y. So when I came in, I see 
this [indecipherable] table, 
with wh ite tablecloth, and eating. I couldn™t be
lieve it, th at™s a dream. So I decided I got 
married, only the condition my  brother should st
ay with us. So that
™s what™s happened. 
From that month, turn into two years. They didn™t let into the Unite
d State, they™re going 
to elect a president, it took two year. So, a ve
ry hard time in Austri
a. We couldn™t work, 
we have to  live on a ration, [indecipherable]
 gave us. A herring, a piece of bread, and 
that™s how we lived for two year. Finally, we fi
nd out, in order to go to America, we have 
to go to Vienna. Vienna was occupied  by the 
Russian. So we got ourse
lves on that train, 
and we start to go. The Russian
 soldier came out, and he says
, ﬁNo, you can™t go there.ﬂ 
So he took us down  from the train. So  we wa
s waiting for another train, and we came  to 
Vienna, on the boat, on Vienna. No w, we have
 to go out from Vienna
 to Germany, with 
our paper. Rush  -- Vienna was 
occupied by the Ru ssian, so 
we couldn™t go. So  we were 
standing, they tore us down 
from the other train, and th ey 
told us, ﬁYou got to live here, 
you got to vote here, and di
e here. You can never go out from here.ﬂ We were like 10 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
10
 
 
 
people. So, we standing at night, and thinking 
what we going to do, 
til a -- a German guy, 
a young guy came over to us, a
nd he says to us, like that, 
ﬁYou know, my father takes 
people over the border. If you want to go, you 
give me a few dollars, til -- I™ll tak e you, 
show how to go over 
the mountain.ﬂ If I see 
the mountain during the day, I wouldn™t 
climb up. So  we took -- I said, ﬁWhat™s going to
 be if he catch you?ﬂ The Ru ssian is out -
- downstairs, you could see they work ing with 
the car. He says, ﬁWell, I tell him my  cow 
got lost, and I went to look fo
r the cow.ﬂ He got us over th
e mountain, we stay overnight, 
but how we got down from the mountain, th e 
very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay 
down  [indecipherable] they had a hard time 
to get down. We came down, finally, from 
the mo untain, we didn™t carry anything. We
 came down from the mountain, we already 
on th e other side, in Germany. In Germany, you 
can™t go in a hotel at night, everything is 
closed. And it™s raining, we don™t have a pl
ace where to go. While we was walking, I 
walk over -- a man was walking with a lady, 
and I says to him, ﬁWhat -- we just came 

from the other side, and it™s raining. Wh ere can 
we go?ﬂ So he says to us, ﬁCome on, I™ll 
take you to a hotel, ma ybe they ™ll let you in .ﬂ 
So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and 
the guy said, ﬁI™m sorry, no room.ﬂ I says to 
him, ﬁListen, I don™t care what you see, I™m 
going to  sit here in the lobby, I™m not going 
out in the rain. No wa
y I™m going out. We 
don™t -- we just came in, and we 
have no place else to go.ﬂ So
 he gave us a room, and we 
stood there. Once we got there, we went to
 Bremen, in Germany, 
and we have to wait 
like five weeks til we can go to America. Th
e problem is, people who came to the Joint, 
got it good. They  greet them by the plane. Th
ey gave them -- they pay six months rent, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

they gave them a job. We didn™t came th
rough the Joint. My hus
band™s cousin was a 
religious man, he wants to show in  the shul
 he do something, so he borro wed the paper 
for somebody else, so they was not responsible
 for us. So, we came he -- we came to 
Boston. From Boston we have to  take a train 
to Chicago. Nobody wa
its for us, we didn™t 
know any langu -- English, nothing. So we 
sitting in the Union St
ation, and in the 
morning -- a whole night -- in the morning, 
I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each 
other. They come to clean -- and 
I finished school in Po land. 
So I walked up and tell them 
the story there. Nobody waits for us, where sh
ould we go, what shou
ld we do? So they 
pick up a telephone book, I gave them the a
ddress and the telephone, and they  called the 
people, and they picked us up. 
They picked us up, then we 
came to Chicago. I came to 
the HIAS , and told  them the story, they said
, ﬁWe™re not responsib le for you, you can™t -- 
we don™t want to do nothing,
 not even a job.ﬂ Lu
ckily, I find here a friend, he took me 
into the factory to work . I was two days in th
is country , I went to wo rk. And I didn™t even 
have money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid
 the car fare. And I went there, I got a job. 
My husband didn™t get a job ri
ght away. We went thro ugh a 
very hard time in Chicago, 
we couldn™t get a -- a place there to live. We 
stayed with them three, four weeks, so 
finally they rented a room for 
us. The lady put in, in a closet
, she put in a bed, in a walk-
in closet. There was no heat, where to put a ch air. That™s wasn™t a -- 
that wasn™t the worst 
thing. She got three teenage gi
rls, we couldn™t use a washroom
 in the mo rning, and I have 
to run downtown to punch a card. So I washed
 my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work. 
I worked a couple of years downtown, til -- 
til finally we got another apartment, you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
12
 
 
 
know, just rented. If you was lucky, just re
nted an apartment, by somebody, not on our 
own. So  finally, my  husband couldn™t ge
t a job, so so mebody recommended the 
[indecipherable] work he does
, a lot of Jewish and Po lish people open up a cleaning 
store. For that you don™t need money. You 
take an empty store, 
you buy an old sewing 
machine. I still didn™t give up my job. So I 
worked there, we open up the cleaning store, 
my  husband was in the cleaning store, and that
™s the work, I came to  work in the store, 
and I worked til 12 at night to keep up the th
ing. Next couple years,
 and I already have a 
little money in the bank saved 
up, and I have the children. 
You know, it was very hard, 
the beginning, we don™t have he
lp from nobody. Mo stly refugees
 come, they have a lot of 
help. The Joint pay the rent, th
ey -- they get them a job, th
ey watch over them. I didn™t 
have that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away 

there was organized camp, they
 got wh at to eat. We was on th e bad side, we was in 
Poland, we couldn™t go back, th
e Russian didn™t let us go to
 the border. So, we live hard 
times. 

Q: Let me ask you a couple 
things. I just need to -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Move this slightly. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Let me ask you this -- let™s -- le
t™s leave your story right there -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- where you™re -- you™re now in this co
untry, but I™d like to
 go back actually -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
13
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- to where you started, and pi
ck up on a -- a couple things -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that you said. I™m -- I™m st
ill a little curious ab
out that first day, wh en you realized 
you were free. I mean, how long do you 
-- was it after you heard you were free that 
everybody started to run in to
 the town  and look fo r food? 
Was it just a couple minutes, 
was it a couple hours? 
A: The first minute, we thum to run for food, 
nothing else existed, just food. I ran up and 
I -- I went up on a wagon, started to eat a lot 
of sugar. Anything what we saw, we started 
to eat, we were so hungry. Most people go
t sick from it, becaus
e the stomach was so 
shrink, we couldn™t even eat, but -- but people 
were so hungry, they 
though they™ll eat the 
whole wo rld, would be enough food. That™s ho
w they started to eat. And the German got 
plenty of food in  the house, 
mind you. Fo r 10 years, they st
oring food for 10 years. So 
each time we went in a different hous
e, and -- and we ate there, you know. 
Q: And you said that the houses were empty? 
A: Yeah. They all left, they
 run away. Near our camp, yo
u couldn™t find a house that 
Germans should be occupied th
ere. They were sure that we
 going to kill them when we 
go out.  

Q: What if when you had gone to -- 

A: Yeah? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
14
 
 
 
Q: -- any of these houses, what
 if you had found some of th
e Germans in there? Did you 
want to kill them? 
A: No, there wasn™t, 
they wasn™t there. 
Q: But I™m saying, what if they were
? Did you -- did you want to kill them? 
A: Well, I would like to, but I -- I couldn™t 
do it, no. I tell you wh at™s happened. There 
was, near [indecipherab
le] time, was a lot of soldiers, 
and th ere was -- and when -- and a 
lot of raping going on, too. So  when we we
nt into the house, came 
in a Russian officer, 
I™ll never forget, a very intelligent man. And 
he says, ﬁThey let out from the jails, the 
worst thing, and they rape the woman. I™m 
g o ing to sit the whole 
night and watch you. 
[indecipherable] I can do 
nothing about it,ﬂ he told us. So
 that™s what -- he was sitting a 
whole night, and they start to knock in the 
door, and then, when they
 saw him, they run 
away. Then we went a little further, and thesame thing happened. So we made up -- the 

girls, we were 10 girls, we made up, if they
 knock on the door, we
 run out in th e back 
door, and there was a lot of broken trains, so 
every girl was laying un
der a train the whole 
night, cause train didn™t move, they was 
broken. And we was laying a whole night, and 
there was [indecipherable] got in
 the house. A whole night th
at we were laying there til 
it™s got light, then we -- we came out from the 
-- under th e trains, and we start to look to 
go any fu rther. There was a big struggle
 after the war, a big struggle. Was no 
government, was no nothing.  
Q: Did you -- right after the liberation, wher
e were you for the next few days or weeks 
after that? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
15
 
 
 
A: All by ourself. 
Q: Did you go back into  the cam
p, or once you left the camp
 did you never go back in 
there? 

A: No, we didn™t go back, we didn™t -- we 
didn™t go back. You know, 
in a room like that, 
half the size, was may b e a hundred girls. We
 was laying down , there was no room to turn 
over, that™s how it was. We didn
™t go back. We went in the ho
uses, we took some clothes. 
So then, we went on a train, the train was st
anding [indecipherable] going. We took some 
clothes for ourself, we went on the train. 
The train was standing all night. So  a Ru ssian 
fella came in, and he says, ﬁOh, girls are here
, okay, we going to bring my  friend.ﬂ So we 
ran out from the train, and we wait there, the tr
ain left w ith all our stuff, we have to go 

look for other stuff. We didn™t wa
nt to go back to that train.
 Was a big struggle after the 
war, with no government, no [indecipherable] 

Q: So from the -- from the 
mo ment of liberation -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you were -- you were totally on your own? 
A: On our own. No body could help us. As 
a matter of fact, we saw our -- our German 
guard  with a wagon, with horses. So we walk
ed over, he should gi
ve us the wagon. He 
says no. So we went to a Russian fellow, an
d officer, we told him we want the wagon to  
go aw ay from the camp. So  he took th e Germ
an by the head, and th rew him in the -- in 
the ground, he says, ﬁYou take whatever yo
u want, you™re entitled, 
and go ahead.ﬂ One of 
my  girls knew how to operate a wagon with  
[indecipherable]. See, we tried to go any

forwarder and forwarder, til we g o t to Poland
, and then we have 
to leave everything 
behind, because they -- they 
-- they checked us up. We di
dn™t have any money anyway, 
but was free -- travelin g was free, people di
dn™t have anything. I mean, Po land was our 
graveyard, it was impossible to 
be there, they killed 50 peopl
e in Kelts. That™s the people 
who lived through the war, they
 came from Russia with childre
n, they killed them all. 
Whatever they find a 
Jew, they killed him. 
Q: Did you know th at this was happening in 
Poland before you went
 back th ere, or not? 
A: We didn™t know -- we didn™t -- that we
 should go. We just didn™t want to be in 
Germany, so we tried to go back in Poland. 
It was a mi stake. We didn™t know th ey going 
to organize. We didn™t know wh at to do actua
lly, where to go. Finally 
I went to -- back to 
Poland, and some people took back property, 
you know -- that we went back. There was 
no way to  go back  without an or
ganization to take care of you. 
Q: You mentioned -- you mentioned earlier, a
nd I think you mentioned in one of your 
video interviews, that Jews we
re being killed by the -- how 
do you say it, 
the armia -- 
A: Armia kryova, yes. 

Q: And what -- what kind of gr
oup was that? Who were they? 
A: That was -- that were like a undergro und Po
lish army . They was for one thing, just to 
kill the Jews, that was their id
ea. They killed four girls ri
ght near our town, in a little 
town. 

Q: Mm-hm. Had they been figh
ting the Germans, as -- were 
they like the underground, or 
what -- what were they? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
17
 
 
 
A: No, I don™t know if they was fighting, but
 that was the -- after 
the war, that was after 
the war. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Maybe they was, but I don™t think so -- that
 they did. Only the 
Poles would fight after 
the -- the German -- [indecipher
ab le] the Russian, they organized themself, but not the 
other, not the others. But Jewi
sh people was fighting in th
e ghettos all over, a lot of 
people don™t even know about
 that. In Bialystok, 70 people -- I went -- went there -- 
came there to find a grave, 70 people were 
fighting, girls and boys was fighting against 
the German. 
Q: And I think while y
ou were in one of the camp s, ther
e was an uprising in one of the 
camps, wasn™t there? 
A: That was in Birkenau, yes. One of my girl
friends, she -- they hanged
 the four girl. See, 
the woman [indecipherable] amm
unition, and when the men came
 intowork 
in the camp, 
they gave him the ammunitio
n, you know, little. Well, when
 the uprising was there, I 
thought when they -- th
ey killed a couple Germ
ans, they put them in
 the oven, they did 
whatever they could. Bu t, in a few minutes
 later, you co uldn™t see the sky, that™s how 
many airplanes [indecipherable] German. And 
th e German wants to find out how did the 
people organize themselve, and to kill so ma
ny Germans, and all this thing. Well, they 
ran across one girl, but she broke down  -- not
 mine girlfriend, from my town, she broke 
down and told them on three ot
hers. They arrested the girls,
 they kept them in a bunker. 
One of my  friend, she was typing whatever 
they say. They took 
her -- I don™t know how 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
18
 
 
 
you call it, the strip? What inside with steel
, you know, strip, like it™s -- how you call it? 
A strip. When you going to b
eat up something, you have a -- 
Q: When you™re going to -- 
A: The thing, yeah. 
Q: Oh, you mean
, like a whip? 
A: A whip, yes, and they put in steel, and th
ey beat them on the bo
dy, on the naked body, 
and a doctor was there to revive them, so th
ey can get out of them. Mine girlfriend never 
told anyone, and the four girls was hanged, right
 in the -- we have to stay and watch. This 
was only four weeks before they ev acuated 
from Auschwitz. Like in January , that™s 
[indecipherable] they killed four girls, you know. 

Q: Do you have any idea, 
during that uprising, how many Germans were killed? 
A: No, I don™t know. They coul
dn™t kill that many, because so
me of them started to run, 
you know, away, and they shot
 them down anyway. They k
ill mostly the Germans, but 
the -- but the Sondercommando were working,
 you know. They -- 
they -- they  killed 
them, they put them in the 
oven, they did a lot of thin
gs, you know. But they  didn™t 
survive, these people, either. 

Q: Did you see any of that happen? 
A: No, I couldn™t see, there was -- no, that 
you couldn™t see. But I saw the sky was right 
away with airplanes, and -- and they start to 
shoot down whoever starts to run. So I don™t 
think everybody make it, you know, out. 
Q: Let™s go back to after the wa
r, when the -- this
 Polish group -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
19
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- was killing Jews. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The -- the English translation is -- I 
think it™s called the Po
lish Home Army, in 
English. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Were you sure that it was members of 
that group that were
 doing these killings? 
A: Yes. That was their name, that was their 
main thing, to kill a
ll the Jews. Jew s lived 
there 400 years, they have some property, an
d for them, the war was a plus, because they 
got in in  a minute -- lot of people was poor
 Po lish, too. And th
ey got in, they got 
everything. They  didn™t want a Jew -- if a Jew 
got in in a house, he
 didn™t get out alive 
any more. So we don™t even know
 how many was killed. They 
didn™t want the Jews ther e 
any mo re, so they could have everything. 

Q: When  you were, you know, 
leaving Germany, and you deci
ded at first to go to Poland 
-- 

A: Yeah, we did -- 

Q: -- and you said well that -- 
A: -- we didn™t realize the reaction, we didn™t realize the -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- we ca -- 

Q: Well that™s -- that™s what I wa
n -- I wanted to ask you about. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
20
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Because, you had lived
 in Poland, I mean -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did -- wi --  
A: [inaudible] 
Q: -- did you -- from your past life, you hadn™t -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you didn™t feel that the Poles were hostile to Jews? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: Or that they were? 

A: -- they were very hostile, but we thou ght after the war, maybe it™s changing. We 
couldn™t believe they™re going to
 -- ready to kill the Jews. We
 didn™t -- we didn™t think of 
it. In po -- was very bad in Poland lately, 
after the war, you know what™s happened  in 
Poland. First of all, when we went [indecipher
able] theytold
 us the Polish, in the same 
age where we were, ﬁGo to Palestine, you d
on™t belong in here. That™s not your place.ﬂ 
That was one thing. We got up
 in the morning, we saw all 
kind of signs on th  -- on the -- 
on the building, the J -- the Jews are Communist
s, the Je ws are that 
and that. Then, after 
that, they put down th
e -- they organized them in the churches. Every Po le who came in 
for the village, have to wear a green band, and 
stay by the Jewish stor
e, so when the other 
people come in, they wouldn™t let them in. 
You know, that™s a Jewish store, you™re not 
supposed to go to th
e Jewish store. That was a open 
boycott in Poland.
 Even in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

[indecipherable] asking wh at you going to  do w
ith the Jews, with three and a half million 
Jews, which to build up Pola
nd, 400 years, they say, b
eating up make no sense, but 
boycott them with the business, that™s yes. Th
at was written all over, in the papers. So the 
government was hostile, and the pe
ople was 10 times more hostile. 
Q: So when you went back to Pola
nd and fo und all this going on -- 
A: We knew about it. 

Q: Did it make you angry? How did you feel? 
A: We was angry, see, we had 
-- we have a house, I want to
 take back the house from the  
government. Mine girlfriends the same thing, 
they have houses. Then
 they figure, maybe 
we™ll find somebody from family
. Maybe they was in differen
t camp, and they survive. 
That was the reason we went back . I wouldn™t
 want to stay in Poland, but bec -- be -- 
there was no way out. If not the Bricha, ever
ybody will be killed th
ere, they wouldn™t 
leave anybody else. They t
ook care on them. They knew 
-- they knew, because the 
Bricha, some of them was born in Po land, and 
they knew. That™s the 
only way to get out 
the Jewish people from there.

Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Lonia Mo sak. This is tape numb er one, side 
B. You went back to 
Poland, and found all 
this going on -- 
A: We knew, but -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
22
 
 
 
Q: Did it make you angry? How did you feel? 
A: We was angry, see, we had 
-- we have a house, I want to
 take back the house from the  
government. Mine girlfriends the same thing, 
they have houses. Then
 they figure, maybe 
we™ll find somebody from family
. Maybe they was in differen
t camp, and they survive. 
That was the reason we went back . I wouldn™t
 want to stay in Poland, but bec -- we -- 
there was no way out. If not the Bricha, ever
ybody will be killed th
ere, they wouldn™t 
leave anybody else. They t
ook care on them. They knew 
-- they knew, because the 
Bricha, some of them was born in Po land, and 
they knew. That™s the 
only way to get out 
the Jewish people from there. 
So they took [indecipherable] a 
half a million, when they 
came back from Russia. 

Q: The -- you mentioned I think that nine 
or -- nine or 10 girls that y-you -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you were together. 

A: We were together all the time. 
Q: Who were they? How did you -- how di
d you get togeth er, 
and how did you -- 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- form your group, and -- 
A: -- I tell you something. In Auschwitz, we™re
 like that, when  you stay in a group, some 
speak French, some speak Yugo
slavian, some speak Greece, 
so everybody stick to their 
own town, to their own friends, what we went
 to school together. So, I was with mine 
group. Everybody got their own 
clique, like they say, because
 we couldn™t -- we couldn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
23
 
 
 
communicate. The others speak Greek, they
 speak French, they sp eak Italian. We 
couldn™t -- we couldn™t understand. So  they 
did the same thing, they  grouped themself 
with their own people, 
with the same language. That™s the way it was. 
Q: So was your group -- were
 they from your
 town, or -- 
A: From mine town, mine -- we went to scho
ol togeth er, town . The thing is, but I didn™t 
mention it, they always made selections in
 Auschwitz. The selections were like that. 
Because they couldn™t bring a 
townsbut on the outside, like th ey got a note, 3,000 people 
got to be killed. So, they to
ok from the place that we were
 standing -- people only surv ive 
in the wa -- the last in the line. I came back to the barr
ack one Hanukah,
 1943, yeah, I 
came back, we were thousand in  the -- in th
e barrack, only three came back. They co unt 
up, if they have enough, they 
they™ll let the last 
go. Only three came 
back from thousand. 
And that -- each time there are selection, so
mebody ask you how you survive, I always 
said the same thing, I was the 
last in the line. That™s the 
only way, not because we were 
smart, or we was healthy, didn™t matter. They
 have to burn so many people. And th at was 
even worse, because the peop
le when they came
 from a transport, they didn™t know 
what™s going on, it was the nigh
t. But when they took the 
people from the camp, and we 
know where they™re going, that
 wasn™t -- that was very sad. There -- there was crying, 
there was hollering, they were singing the Ha
ptikvah. But they knew where they going, 
they saw every -- and you know 
how when they put the people 
on the truck, they didn™t 
took him down  gentle, they open  up, and ju
st like potatoes, they 
roll down on the -- on 
the ground. That™s the way they treated people. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

Q: I™ve talked to, in some 
of the other interviews -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- I™ve done with people who were in the camps -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: They -- 
A: Were in Auschwitz? 

Q: Various camps. 
A: Yeah, it™s -- 
Q: Various ones, several. But th -- one thing th
at some of the people, not all of them, but 
some have said to me that by so rt of the da
y of liberation, or the time of liberation, the 
end of the war -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- they -- they had almost given up, or were 
almo st ready to die, th
at they didn™t care 
any more. 
A: Yeah, it™s happens to me, too. 
Q: I™m wondering how you fe
lt? That happened to you? 
A: I really wanted to commit su
icide, to be honest with you.
 We were starving in Poland, 
there was nobody to -- I started 
to sew a little bit to make a fe
w cents. We -- we bought a 
few potatoes, that™s where -- we didn™t have
 an -any nothing, the Polish govern ment 

wouldn™t help you. So, I really wanted to
 commit suicide, there was no way out. So , in 
time, came a guy from mine town, what he 
was going to the Yeshiva, by a -- by a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
25
 
 
 
[indecipherable] next to the Ye
shiva. So he knews me. So he
 said, ﬁListen, don™t stay 
here, the life™s danger. I™ll take you to Lódz
.ﬂ There was kibbutzim there. We didn™t 
know wh ere to go. How can you go when  you 
don™t know where to 
go, to wh om to go? 
Was very sad. So, he took a few of us, we went
 in there, he took us
 in a kibbutz. So, to 
me it was a haven, you got a roof over the head
, and you got a piece of bread. And then  I 
have to go to Bialystok, 
and was very sad of a day. 
Q: So, did I understand this
 right? You were saying that
 you wanted  -- you felt like 
committing suicide, even wa -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- when the war was over? 

A: Yeah, that™s was in 1945. 
There was no way out, we couldn™t go back to Germany, we 
didn™t have anybody. Even  you™re starving, yo
u -- you kind of don™t feel like to live any 
more. Luckily, that guy came in, to one -- he 
was born in our town , 
too. And he looked 
around, and he said, ﬁListen, 
let™s go from [indeciphe
rable] they alrea
dy killed four girls 
in that little village. Let™s go out, stay in a bi
g city, in a kibbutz, th
er -- at least they™re 
organized.ﬂ So we were happy. He was like 
an angel coming from the sky. You know, we 
were happy that somebody show
 us the way where to go. Th
e big ci -- the big -- in our 
city, they wasn™t organized, you couldn™t talk 
to nobody. Like I told
 you, the government 
gave me the key from this school, where I fi
nished school, laid down on the floor, no 
clothes, no beds, no food, no 
nothing. It was -- it was horrible. It was very bad.  
Q: The -- just go back for a sec
ond, the gr -- the group of -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
26
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- girls from your town. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mb er any of 
their names? Do you know if 
any of them are still alive? 
A: Oh yeah, tell you all the names, yeah. On e 
just died last year, she was in -- in New 
York. One just died. Some of th
em are in Israel. I hear a few 
already died too, over there. 
Some of them end up in a institution, they lo
st their mind, you know? A lot of them went 
up in an institution there. A
nd one of my ne -- closest fri
end, [indecipherable] in the 
underground, she lived in Cana
da, and she got killed. A car went up -- she went out from 
a wedding, and going to go home, and a car we
nt on the sidewalk, and he killed her. That 
was my closest friend, from mine town, we went
 to school togeth er. So here, we have to 
make new friends. The others, I 
don™t have any. I only  have one friend in  Detroit which -- 
she came here in 1939 -- 1937, with a grap
 -- a group of youngsters. That™s the only 
friend from mine childhood I have. All the othe
r -- yes, I meet them
 in Florida. They 
went in Russia, where they su
rvive, in Russia. Some -- a fe
w was in the camps, so we get 
together all the time, and we go out for di
nner, and we keep togeth er, the group. Some 
lives in Detroit, some lives in Philadelphia,  some lives in New Jersey. A few of them, 
yeah. 
Q: So that -- that -- that group of you all -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- can you say for the record 
what some of their names were? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
27
 
 
 
A: Yes, I™ll tell you the name. Wh
ich I meet in Florida, yeah? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: These people? Becau -- 

Q: Yeah, but also the -- the original group that you -- 
A: -- the others went -- the original went to  Israel, and some of them died over there 
[indecipherable] institution. On
e died in New Yo rk. I really don™t have any -- the 
original, they™re not here any mo
re. The one there, what I meet
 in Florida, they went to 
Russia, that™s how th ey got saved, yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So we meet then. 

Q: Yeah.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: But again, I was just wonde
ring, just for the record -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- if you could ju st say their names? 
A: Yeah, I can tell you. One -- only one is 
there, Dinka Blanke -- well now, she got 
married, sh e got a different name. One is na
med Dinka, and one is
 named Kirsch. Those 
two was in Auschwitz, but they
 got married, you know, so th
ey change their name. All 
the others didn™t surv ive, no. I hear they wa 
-- they die in Israel, 
one was [indecipherable] 
institution, yes. No, I had -- my
 friends now, it™s not the original friend. None of them. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
28
 
 
 
I™ll show you th e picture here when  I finish 
school, and I graduate. 
Only one was what -- 
she was in the underground, 
in -- in -- in Auschwitz, she™s on that picture, too. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s -- let™s pick up the 
story where you went to the kibbutz.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: And then  how lo ng were you th
ere? What happened after that? 
A: I wa -- we could only stay the six months 
in one kibbutz, we ha
ve to smuggle ourself 
to Israel. B ecause I was waiting for my brother, so they sent me to Bialystok. 

Q: How did you know that yo
ur brother was still alive? 
A: Oh, some people smuggled  themself out 
from Russia, on the boat there. My brother 
was waiting til they give him a legal -- legal to go
 out. So, when I talk
 to them, so I told 
them, oh, I was with him in Siberia together, 
so I already got a name. And I start to write 
letters there, and it took a coup
le months til he came back, in 
a legal way. So that™s when 
we was together nows, we have live togeth e
r. He couldn™t come to the United State, I was 
on th e papers for my  husband. He was -- not 
1945. They got two categories, 1945 - 1946. 
1946 couldn™t go to America. They came 
from Russia, no, not these people, only the 
1945. So he was there in -- liv
ing in Vienna, and I got some papers for him in here -- to 
bring him over here, but he got -- unfortunately  he got killed a couple of years later in a 

car accident. He got run over, yeah. That™s 
was -- I -- I™m the only 
one from my family, 
from my father™s side. From 
my mother™s side, nobody ev
er survived, none of them. 
Q: Did you -- and, right after the war -- 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
29
 
 
 
Q: -- did you know that, that no one was left but your brother? 
A: I-I-I knew, I knew, but anybody who surv
ived, there was offi
ces where you put on 
your name, if somebody else come . Now, I kne w that nobody surviv
e, and I didn™t see 
any name. Sometime when my brother was still 
in Russia, and I announced on the radio, 
and I wrote postcard -- Kirshenbaum is my  ma
iden  name, so a lot of people came from 
other town, but it wasn™t my  brother, they 
just got the same name, b u t wasn™t that. 
Q: And then , after the kibbutz, where did you go? 
A: No, like I told you, the Br
icha took us out from Poland, 
we went to Austria -- to 
Czechoslovakia first, then to Au
stria. In Austria, I remained 
there, because I got married. 
So, I took my  brother and 
t-took us two years to co
me to the United State. 
Q: How did you meet your husband? 

A: He came to look for his brothers. He got 
four brothers in the Russian army , so he 
thought maybe somebody, because those really
 -- a transport with the people came, but 
none of th em survived. And he was surprise
d to see [indecipherable] because I was the 
only one, but mo stly people from Russia, when 
they came back. So th at™s how I met him. 
So, took me out, and show me the hotel, and got
 papers, and that was like a miracle. So I 
decided to  get married. 
Q: Did you -- this is a little
 bit of a funny question -- 
A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: -- but, I mean, did you get married becaus
e he had papers, and 
he could get you to  
America, or did you get married because you were in love? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
30
 
 
 
A: N-No , n-no, no, no, no, no. 
I tell you so mething. He was very nice, was a nice person, 
he was the -- he was not far from out of 
town, you know, junhanfrum. He™s fro m Ben-
Gurions -- he treat me nice, he
 was a very nice man. So I figure, what do I got to lose? I 
have -- everybody got married
 lik e that after the war. 
You met some body, you get 
married, that™s the only way to do, not to be
 alone. That™s was the only way. No, if I 
wouldn™t like him a little bit, no I woul
dn™t marry, no. That™s for sure not. 
Q: Were you madly in love with  him, or kind of in love with him, or -- 
A: We tried to be in love, you know, but we 
really didn™t know each other, to be honest 
true. We have to do it in a co
uple days, because that tran spor
t was in Austria, have to go 
foraday. I kind of sneak out from the barra
cks, and came to the little city. And you 
couldn™t stay in the little city 
until you got papers. We have to
 pay up in the government 
to paper, that I should stay 
here. I couldn™t go back ther
e, those people go forw ard 
already. So I kind of sneak out
 from that camp, you know? 
Q: So you said you -- you trie
d to be in love. Do you thi
nk th at he felt the same way? 
That -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yes. We -- we got along nice. 
He got a brother, too, we all lived together, 
mine brother, his brother, we all lived togeth
er, and I kind of took 
care on everybody.  
Q: Sounds like you were almost like crea
ting -- like kind of creating instant families? 

A: Yeah, we did, we did, yeah. We did. 
He got a brother came over from Germany to 
Austria. I got the brother from Russia. And 
I said, whatever I do, I don™t go away from 
my  brother, and got to be with 
us together. So we all lived to
gether, yeah, that™s true. His

brother couldn™t come because to America, he
 come later. My brother come later, maybe 
two years later. But when he came already, I 
had an  apartment, because I make money, I 
prepare everything [indecipherable]. Now, wh
en my  brother came, I already had a child, 
yeah. Was two y
ears later, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. So then  -- then you went over th
e mountains, right? That was -- that™s when 
we came out to Au stria, to go out to th
e German border, in -- and Russia occupied  
Vienna, you couldn™t go out fro
m Vienna, you have to snea
k out, was very hard . Was a 
very hard thing go -- it™s re
ally hard to believe it, how people manage like that. 
Q: Yes, yeah, I™m -- 
A: To climb on mountain, then to go down  
it [indecipherable] yeah. But we did it on the 

night, that -- that™s what we have to do, 
a lot of things which sometime we think it™s 
impossible, but we have to do it.  

Q: When  you th ink about these things now -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- I mean, so many years have gone by, 
and you re -- you remember some of these 
things -- 
A: Yeah, sure. 
Q: -- does it seem kind of
 unbelievable to you? 
A: Yeah, it™s unbelievable to other people, not for me. Luck ily, I had a profession, I went 
on th e second day to  a nice j
ob to make money. I was fast
, I was working  piecework. 
And we were on our own, with  no help of 
an ybody. I was lucky I found th is man, you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
32
 
 
 
know, from my  town , and he took me in on the 
job, in the factory, was a big factory. I 
work ed th ere a couple of years, yeah.  
Q: When  you did co me over to the United States -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- did you come on a boat? 
A: We come out on a boat, you know. No t 
on a regular boat, a boat where they  bring 
animals, ev erybody was sick, 
like little sack, you was laying 
a little sack. And voo -- a lot 
of people said, ﬁThrow me in the ocean, I 
don™t want to live any more.ﬂ They were 
throwing up, was horrible. And it was a big 
storm, it was even in the papers, written 

down, they didn™t thought
 that that boat will make it. It was on a little boat 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Where did you leave from? Do you remember
 the name of the boat, or any of that? 
A: No. The boat I don™t rememb
er, but the -- that -- but I 
remember we came with an 
airplane, we came -- no, I don™t remember th
e name of the boat, no. It was a -- a 
miserable boat. 
Q: What -- where did it leave from? 

A: Oh, they -- they brought us
 to Boston. In Bost
on we stay overn ight, and we took a 
train to come back to Chicago. And the HIAS
 paid, but I paid them
 back, because they 
told me that I -- you come to a sponsor. So  th
e first check I got, I 
paid them back 70 
dollars, in that time was a lot of money, bu
t I paid them right away  back, you know. 
Q: So th e first place you landed in 
the United States was Boston -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
33
 
 
 
A: Boston, yeah, overnight -- 
Q: -- but you were just there for the night, right? 

A: -- overnight, that™s all. 

Q: Do you remember when  you
 pulled into the harbor what
 it looked like, what it was 
like to finally be in 
the United States, do you 
remember any of that? 
A: No, we didn™t know nothi
ng. I think a Jewish organiza
tion was waiting for the people 
to come down from the boat. There was Gentile
 people there on the boat, too. They were 
-- took us out, I don™t know wh at, a certain pl
ace, and we stay overnight. They  gave us a 
[indecipherable] he said we got 
to go on a train next day. So
, we didn™t even see Boston, 
we didn™t see those things. 

 Q: And then you had a train ride, that -- was that a couple days? 
A: No, next mo rning we have to go, we have
 to go next morning,
 they was back in 
Chicago, and I come to Ch icago, nobody 
waits for us. We didn™t know th e English 
language. So , luckily, when  Po lish wo men cam
e to work in the -- whole night we were 
sitting on a bench, and I see they
™re speaking Polish, I said, 
ﬁYou help me out? Because I 
don™t know who to call, and what -- what to do.ﬂ
 So they said, ﬁJust 
give us the telephone 
number, we™ll take the telephone book,ﬂ and 
to call him [indecipherable] come p ick us 
up. They  was very Orthodox people, very reli
gious people. So we stood there fo r a week, 
til we got a bedroom someplace, th en we moved out.  
Q: Do you know wh ich group the -- the people
 who came and met you at the train station, 
do you know wh at group th
ey were conn
ected with? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
34
 
 
 
A: No, with nobody, that was 
a second cousin of my husba
nd™s, they carried the same 
name Mosak, the same name. So they came, a
nd they  want to show 
in the shul they do 
something, but that wasn™t g
ood for us. It didn™t work out
 good for us, because we was on 
our own, we have to look fo r wo rk and all th
is thing, we don™t kn
ow th e language. You 
come to a country, if you  have a professi on, it™s half the battle, you know what I mean? 
You wo rk, you learn the language. I went to ni
ght school here. But at least I make a few 
dollars, you know? Because in 
the beginning, I was really  wa
s starving here, too. I asked 
the woman where we were,  and to borrow me 
a dime fo r a roll, til I get a check. We 
didn™t have anything. 

Q: When  you were taking that train ride, an
d when  you got here, and all, I™m wondering, 
how did things look to you? He
re you were in this totally di
fferent country, very different 
from where you™d been. 

A: Yeah, yes, that™s right. 

Q: Did it seem like a v ery strange place? 
A: It was very strange. When I looked out, wh en I was on the station, and I saw the cars 
are running all night, I says, ﬁHow I™m going to
 mingle into this place?ﬂ Looks to me like 
impossible. How we going to live here? 
How we -- especially you don't know th e 
language. I only knew a few wo
rd. It was hard, it was very 
hard, very hard. But if you 
have a profession, whatever 
you go, you can make a dollar 
for -- it was half the battle 
right away . I started to make nice money th at time, yeah. 
Q: Were you happy to be
 in the United States? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
35
 
 
 
A: I was very happy. I was very happy. I took
 every advantage. We were 40 on the table, 
I was the only work  overtime, I didn™t go home.
 Saturday you got a double check, double. 
In the summer, I didn™t took th e vacation, I got
 another check. I was the only one fo r 40 
woman, to come into 
work. I figure I™ll do anything not to be poor any more. I™ll make as 
much money as I can. And that™s 
what I did. Soon, I got the m
oney, I start to run out, buy 
a television, buy a radio, ev
erything. And the people said
, ﬁIt™s not Europe, you get it 
next day.ﬂ I thought if I don™t grab it right aw
ay, I wouldn™t have it. Every chance I got, I 
buy -- I bought for the house, yeah. 
There we got an apartment, yeah.  
Q: And you -- you started to ha
ve children, wh en was that? 
A: A couple of years later. We came end of
 ™48, my  daughter was born 1950, in  
Thanksgiving. Until I had money,
 the bank, until I have an apartment, then I had the 
children, yeah. Because we didn™t 
have help from n
obody, nothing. 
Q: And how many children all together? 
A: Two, two daughters I have, yeah . 
Q: And tell us again the years, and wh at 
their names are -- that they were born. 
A: Yeah, Esther is the older 
one, Doro thy the younger one, 
and I consider my self very 
lucky to have tho -- 
those two daughters. 
Q: Mm-hm. I™m wondering, this is a -- this 
is again a little bit of a strange question -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- but, you know, you talked  abou
t the way you and your husband -- 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
36
 
 
 
Q: -- got together, and -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the unusual circumstance. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: I can -- I can imagine some people doing that, who would -- 
A: Ever. 

Q: -- do that, get over here -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and say, okay, now we™re
 here, now we™re safe, you kno
w, we should -- we should 
break up now, and th en go find other people. 

A: Well, I want to tell you something. My hu
sband was a sick man . 
Later on I find out he 
was sick. Wasn™t sick when I was mar ried,
 six months later I 
find out that he had 
bleeding ulcer. I would never do it to nobody. Even I could make my self better, and I had 

a chance, and I didn™t took th
e chance. But for me, I [in d eci
pherable] the world, I would 
not do it to nobody. I™d rath
er suffer than to make my
self better. [indecipherable] 
Q: I™m -- I™m not following ex
actly what you™re saying. 
A: Yeah, I could have have a better life if 
I want to change, in 
that time when I come 
here. It was a lot of men, and only a few girl
s came to the United State, but I didn™t -- I 
wouldn™t do that to nobody, 
not to my  husband, not to 
nobody. But me, I work as a 
[indecipherable] and what I make up is for 
good and fo r bad, you 
know. I wouldn™t do it. 
Some people do it, a lot of them break up right away . 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
37
 
 
 
Q: You saw that? 
A: Yeah. They live in 
New York. They  want to
 come to this countr
y, and they want to 
have the paper, and th ey broke
 up right away , they came a 
couple weeks later, and they 
marry somebody else. A lot of them, yeah. Bu
t not everybody had the 
heart to do it, no. 
Even you can make some
 -- so -- better, no, I wouldn™t do it, no. 
Q: When  you came here, and star
ted establishing your life -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- were you in contact with 
lots of other survivors who had co me to the area, or not -- 
A: No, was I -- it was only the only one in 1948
, and I didn™t see -- then, when we open 
up a cleaning store, they come in, most of 
them Hungarians Jews, Czechoslo vakia, not 
from mine town . And so  we got acquain ted with 
them, you know, we tried to keep to -- to 
our own. And th en they  start up an organizati
on, you know, that we got together all the 
time. But none of my  past friends I have, none of them, no. 
Q: Mm-hm. Where was the cleaning store? 
A: On Division. On 
Division Street. You fa
miliar with Chicago? 
Q: Well, I lived here, so -- 
A: Yeah, on Division, on -- firs
t we have on Spau lding and 
Poto mac, and then  we moved 
up to  the main street, on Division Street. 

Q: Where at on Division, do you remember? 

A: On Potomac -- yes, within
 -- corner Potomac and Spauld
ing. Was a -- was a hardware 
store, a butcher store, and that was our store,
 a cleaning store, we were there a couple of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
38
 
 
 
years. Then we moved up there, then we
 moved again, becau
se the neighborhood 
changed. We moved on Ja
rveese, wasn™t good over there, 
either. S o , we still -- you have 
our lease, you have to  stay. And then I start to
 take in work in  my own house, and I still 
do it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So Jarvis -- so you lived 
in Roger™s Park for a while? 
A: No, no. Yeah, that time we live alre
ady in -- in West Roger™s Park. Yeah 
[indecipherable] we moved [indecipherable] we
 live on Division Street, then we moved 
to Albany Park, from Albany Pa
rk, we moved to -- we moved 
to West Roger™s Park, and 
I stayed there 33 years. Here I live six years,
 going to  be next month. So  we keep on 
moving all the time. [indeciph
erable] cames to my
 door, that she make me to move, 
which I™m happy here, very ha
ppy. Yes, but here lives a 
lot of refugees, around other 
buildings here. So we get together, we play 
cards a little bit, we go
 out together. We got 
like a social life here. Where I live, everybod
y moved aw ay to Florida, to Las Vegas, 
Arizona, so I lost the friends over there, too.  
Q: Mm-hm. When -- wh
en  you, you know, in those early 
years when you were here, and 
getting established and all that, did you th
ink much, or talk ab
out much with your 
husband or other people what had 
happened during the war, or not? 

A: No, no, no. First of all, we
 were ver -- very busy making 
a living, working all the time. 
No, we never talked about it, 
no. Just recently, when th ey st
art to interview people. A lot 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
39
 
 
 
of people of my  friend don™t want to even talk 
about it, it™s too painful, they can™t take it. 
But I went to Washington a fe
w times, where  they, you know. 
Q: But it sounds like from what you™re saying is  that, you know, mo st of your life since, 
you™ve not talked about it. 
A: No, no, no.  
Q: If some one asked you ab out it, would you -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- refuse to answer, or would you say 
I don™t want to talk
 about this, or -- 
A: Well, I tell you, most people, even the 
people who brought us
 here, they brought 
another family. So, she always talked about 
it, I says, ﬁStop talking about it.ﬂ I never 
talked about it, no. I never say nothing. Bu
t she start [indecipherable], ﬁOh Sonja, stop 
talking, it makes me sick, I don™t want to hear
 about it.ﬂ  They didn™t 
have to tell it to me. 
I didn™t save somebody [indecipherable] tell 
them about not -- pa -- on my  own, no. No , I 
didn™t tell her nothing. 

Q: The mu seum would like you to just tell us
 what the numb er -- what your number was. 
A: The number.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes. 25702. 
Q: Right, which is right there on your arm. 

A: Yes, right here, yeah.  

Q: What -- when you got over
 here, and actually it™s -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
40
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- up to th is day, you have th
is number tattooed on your arm.  
A: Yeah, all the time. 

Q: When  you go out, do you -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- let it show, or -- 

A: No, it show -- 
Q: -- do you try to cover it up? 
A: -- I tell you, when I came to
 this country in this -- and 
in the summer, and I went on 
the train, people moved away, th ey though
t I coming from Sing-Sing, they never saw 
that. So, I have a number, I must b e a criminal
, so they just moved away, they  didn™t want 
to see. Even now whe -- if 
I go in the hospital on -- ﬁWhat is that? You was in a camp, 
you got a good time?ﬂ They didn™t know it wa
s a concentration camp. They never saw 
that. 
Q: Really? 
A: Never saw that, no. 

Q: Do you -- and -- so, you were going around
, it was visible, people were reacting to it? 
A: Yeah, yeah, pe
ople, yeah, no. 
Q: You didn™t cover it up? 

A: No, no, never. I never cover up, no, neve
r. You can™t cover up if you wear short 
sleeve. No, I never cover up. One of my frie
nds doctor take out, and it was a botched up 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
41
 
 
 
job, and she looks worse. So I -- it doesn™t 
bother me. You get used  to things, you know. 
If my granddaughter were little, sh e asks me, 
I told her it™s a telephone number. Like, she 
was two, three years old, wh at you going -- I said mine telephone number. What are you 
so -- tell a kid, you know, in that ag
e? No, it didn™t -- I got used to it. 
Q: What -- as your ch ildren were growing up, 
wa -- did you talk with them mu ch about 
what happened? 

A: No, no, never, never. It was too painfu l. Yo
u don™t want to upset 
kids [indecipherable] 
older, when they™re young, no. Th
ey find out on th eir own, they find out on their own. As 
a matter of fact, I came to visit me, a la
dy from Milwaukee, and she was in camp -- no, 
she was hidden, I think. In how -- those da
ys, a young person, maybe 42 - 43, she said, 
ﬁOh, I never saw the number.ﬂ I said, ﬁDidn™t 
you read in the books, in the paper, in the 
movie?ﬂ She says, ﬁNo, I see the first time.ﬂ 
S o  some people doesn ™t know, even Jewish 
people, a lot of them doesn™t know about it. 

Q: Mm-hm. But at some point, did your 
ch ildren ever start to ask you questions? 
A: Yes. I told them I was in the camp , and 
that™s it, you know? I ne
ver talked about it to 
ma -- it™s too painful, and for children, th
ey would never understand it either, it™s 
impossible. To tell things like th
at, that™s is -- impossible. 
Q: What about when  they got to be older, 
like when they were t
eenagers, or even -- 
A: Yeah, well, they find out, bu
t on their own. They go to th
e library here, and there they 
find out. Bu t I never talked about that
, the way it was -- things was, no.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
42
 
 
 
Q: So you wanted th em to find out about 
it the way an y young person in  this country 
would find out, in history class -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- or by reading, or by seeing a movie? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: But you know, that™s kind of
 distant. I mean, you pick up 
a book and read, it™s a little 
bit abstract. 
A: Yes, but at least they have a knowledge 
now, they teach them in the schools, it™s a 
little bit knowledge, more knowledge. I went a couple years ago downtown, it was a lady 

from Austria, and she™s supposed to  tell th
e people what™s happened . So, a Gentile guy 
came in, a young man maybe 38, and she to ld 
him she was a child, sh
e™s supposed to be 
in the movies, and then she was sitting on th
e street, and the German -- the Austri was 
spitting on her, you are a Jew, and that then
. And they show the 
pictures, she is now 
married, she have kid. So the 
guy says, ﬁI™m so happy that 
I came to  the museum to find 
out, because I would never believe it. Now I se
e it in person. Now I 
can see it.ﬂ The guy, 
a young guy, he said. Some are interested, 
and so me are not interested. I went into a 
restaurant last year, and a couple boys come
 in -- I think they™re 
from Mexico, and they 
told me they have Arab friend, and the Arab
s say bad things about Israel, and all this 
thing, the Jews do this. So I said, ﬁListen, yo
u don™t have to listen to that. If you want to 
know, I™ll tell you th e story. First of all, Jewi
sh people doesn™t go and attack cars, buses 
the children ardi to school. Jewish people does
n™t do this thing, the Arabs do this thing.ﬂ 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
43
 
 
 
If one guy got crazy, he went in one time, got 
[indecipherable] killed people, that doesn ™t 
mean the Jewish people do. The Jewish people ta
ke him to the hospital
 to help him. They 
don™t attack people like they do
, with buses, with 
cars, whatever they
 do. So I -- they 
have -- says, ﬁWell, it™s good to know.ﬂ 16 - 
17 years old. So  I tell them, oh, be happy to , 
because they ask you what the 
number is. They was interested
. They learn in the schools, 
and we explain it to them, those things. 
Q: Mm-hm. If -- let™s say one of your daugh
ters, when she was like 20 or something -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- had come to you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and said, ﬁYou know, I really would like 
to know what happened
 to you during the 
war,ﬂ would you have told her -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or would you say no, I don™t want to. 
A: No, no, yes I told them, yes. Mine daught
er knows, yes. I happens to have pictures. 
One of my friends, whi -- she got killed in ka
re -- Canada, she took a lot of pictures. I 
belonged to a Zionist organization before the 
war, so sh-she took the pictures to our 
neighbor, a Polish. She says, ﬁIf somebody co
mes back, a Jew, please give the picture.ﬂ 
So she came back -- my girlfri
end came back, she got the picture, she made copies, she 
gave it to me. So then I show
 it to my daughter. Then, after 
the war, when I came to the 
United State, they told us [ind
ecipherable] open up a 
book with picture. So I says, ﬁI have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
44
 
 
 
some pictures.ﬂ How do I have pictures? I ha
ve an aunt in Pennsylvan ia, which I didn™t 
know I had, and her children was born here, so  I decided soon I came to this country , I 
get in touch with my aunt. I remembered th
e address, not exactly, but it came the letters 
to her, what I rememb er by heart. And I told her, I says, ﬁI w
ould like to have the pictures 
from mine family, fro m mine uncle.ﬂ She says, 
ﬁIt™s too far to give it to you, you better 

come here, we want to see you.ﬂ That time --

Q: -- is a co ntinuation of a United States

I says, ﬁI would like to have 
the pictures from mine family, fro m mine uncle.ﬂ
 She says, ﬁIt™s too far to give it to you, 

you better come here, we want 
to see you.ﬂ That time planes di
dn™t run in  1949, you have 
to take a train. So we made up they™re going to
 meet us on th e station. They  didn™t find us 
on th e station, I didn™t find them, but a lot of 
people -- what I got a address, I walked over 
to them, and I met them, my aunt, she was a el
derly lady, very religious, too. And she get 

-- took out all the pictures for mine parents, fo
r my  uncle, for my  other uncle.  My turov -
- my uncle was Hank, in na -- mine town -- no
t mine town, a different town. So I -- I got 
all the pictures, and then I went to the mu
seum a -- two times, thre
e times, and I present 
all the pictures, and the book from Israel wh
at came out, I sent away a picture from mine 
family, of a [indecipherable] in
 the book. So I have a few 
documents, at least , yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. Could you just -- actu ally, the museum asked me to ask you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- if you could ju st say the name of -- names of your fami ly me mb ers, and -- 

A: Oh yeah, of course, you 
mean from my uncles, too?

Q: Yeah. 
A: Or j -- or just from mine parents? 

Q: Well, your parents, your uncles -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you know, whatever you remember. 
A: The names? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Co -- my father™s names was Mandel, my
 mother™s name was Esther. My younger 
brother was Shya, and he was 
taken away by a selection in Au schwitz, he was 15 years 
old. So that was it. Th
en for my uncle, tr -- 
Q: Before you go on -- and then -- 
but their last name was what, now? 

A: Kirschenbaum, yeah. Then I can give you 
th e n ame f o r my  un cle.
 My uncle ran away 
from the ghetto. We already was in a ghetto that  -- they decided in mi
ne town, should be 
a mustard -- they connected to Klein-Berlin
. They called it Klein-Berlin. So they didn™t 
make a ghetto, they took out th
e people to -- to each, to other ghettos -- I was in the 
ghetto in  Novidburg in that time. So I found 
out that my uncle ran back. The city wasn™t 
too far, so decided th ey™re going to hang him.
 And there was another brother, my  father™s 
brother, they arrested him t -- cause you are 
a brother, you got to be hanged, to o, because 
there were prominent people in the city. So
 the Gestapo paid them
 off, they shouldn™t 
make the execution in i -- in 
our town, because when they 
hang people, the son have to 
hang a father, because he took
 the [indecipherable] around th
e Jewish cemetery, and tried 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

to hide it. So the son have to hang the fath
er, otherwise all Jewish people will be killed. 
So they decided, a committee,
 they paid off the Gestapo, the execution sh
ould be in 
another town, not -- not the family should 
[indecipherab le]. So they took him to 
Novidburg, where I was born, but I didn™t live 
there, only one year. After the war, I went 
there, to Novidburg, and I di
gged out those graves. I find out [indecipherable] the Polish 
people, they told me exactly 
how many people, they™re saying
 seven people. Two of mine 
uncles, and then [indecipherable] the daughte
r-in-law™s father, and then -- then a boy, 
maybe 19 years old, they told him he thre
w away the [indecipherable], and a couple from 
Plodz. In order to dig that out
, I find a few people in the city, 
I went to the city and they 
helped me. We have to have a permanen -- a 
permit. So, the governor told us, only they  
give us a permit if the -- all 
of them going to put in one 
casket, because they was laying 
in a shallow grave, you know, lik
e that. So I decided, yes, wh
atever they do, it™s all right. 
So we put them in one casket. I didn™t see th
e faces, because you couldn™t rec-recognize 
the faces from 1942 til 1945. An
d they put them on the Jewish
 cemetery there, and I put a 
-- a [indecipherable]. But my  daughter went in 
there, and she said it™s no more there. You 
know what the Polish people did to the cemete
ries. They make fields to -- to grow food 
up at the -- the -- liquidate the cemetery over 
there. That™s what I did after the war for 
mine uncles, you know. And they  have fami lie
s -- I have the pictures from them, which I 
present at the -- Washington  They  have two 
daughters and tw o son. One daughter I saw 
in Auschwitz only one day, then
 I didn™t see her any more. A
nd so  they all got killed. My 
other uncle, [indecipherable] 
was killed, got three daughters
. They all was killed, too.

Q: What were the names of the -- your 
uncles that were killed? Their names? 
A: Binjamin Kirschenbaum, and Aaron Kirs
chenbaum. Then  was Linden Birkdeboy, but 
he was killed, and then was mine cousin, she 
was like 19 years old, she didn™t want to go 
to the shadar. So she took a pin, and ma
rked  on th e bricks, that here lay in the 
Kirschenbaum. When I came af
ter the war, I couldn™t go to 
that brick, they build a 
garage. I tried to get in to get out that bric
k, but I couldn™t, it was 
already build a garage, 
and I couldn™t get to that. But that what I tried to do after the war. 
Q: Have you gone back  to Europe since -- 
A: No. My  daughter went, but no,
 I can™t look at the faces any more, no. I wouldn™t go 
back there for no money in th
e world. I wouldn™t -- I know 
the Po lish people, they very 
unconsi -- they were wors
e than the German. If th -- if a Je
wish -- if a Jewish man, he had 
a business, you know, he put [i
ndecipherable] to hide the cl
oth, they report it to the 
Germans right away . Everything [indecipherable
] they told them who was rich, and who 

was that, who was educated. You know, they
 got the -- it was surrounded with  enemies 
all around, even after the war, but no libera
tion for the Jewish pe
ople. Nobody will ever 
know how many Jews wa
s killed in Poland. 
Q: You were -- you know, all this time, you™re
 living in th e Ch icago area, lot of Polish 
people here. 

A: I hate them. 

Q: Really? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
49
 
 
 
A: I hate them. I tell y ou why. There is a s
hul, a Reform shul near Tuye, so the Polish 
people maybe d -- the third generation, wh at they
 were born here, they
 put in a letter, the 
Jews are kikes, the Jews are miserable. My
 mother told me when
 I was a little girl I 
shouldn™t go near. They was 
born here. We took the letter, 
and we went to Pu chinsky, 
he™s a Polish man, he was a older man. They 
didn™t sign a name who did that. No matter 
the fifth generation they born here, the Polis
h people are miserable, and terrible, and anti-
Semitic. That™s how they™re born. That™s what th e Bricha said. In the 
milk, they got in the 
milk when they was bo
rn, from the mother, to 
be anti-Semitic. That™s the way they are. 
That™s the way they  are. I wouldn™t go near
 him. And mine daughter went there when  
they interview some college pr
ofessor, they said they™re goin
g to teach in the school, go 
and make a remark how they treat them after 
the war, they got red in
 the face, and they 
start, ﬁOh, Poles was killed, too, the Russian 
killed, too.ﬂ  They wouldn™t say -- apologize 

even, no. That™s the way they 
are. They talk nice, gentle, 
but you don™t know what they  
really are.  
Q: So ju st in town, do you av
oid Polish neighborhoods, or -- 
A: Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. I avoid them, yes, 
I avoid th em. I don™t want to have nothing to  
do with them. I try not to. Now, you know, th
ey come to -- they co
me here, th ey clean 
houses. One lady went there to exchange so
me money with them, and they  didn™t know 
she™s -- she ™s a Jew. S o  she says to -- to th
em, ﬁThere™s -- the -- the -- the Jewish people 
they should only drop dead, and 
th ey have such a nice home.ﬂ
 They come here to clean. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
50
 
 
 
They get money for it, pa -- clo -- that™s the 
way they are. I wouldn
™t let them into my 
house.  
Q: Did you ever think about go
ing to Israel, moving to Isr
ael? Cause you said you were 
in a Zionist organization when  you were young. 
A: Yes, I went there three times already. Th
e first time I went because somebody told me 
for asthma it™s good in Israel, so
 I went for a month to  dry out, and somebody told me no, 
somebody seek whatev er you go.
 I went there three times already, yes, in Israel. But 
when I got married, in the pa
per it was for the United State,
 and we came here, and we 
start to make a living, and th en you have a fa
mily, then you can™t pick yourself up and go. 
But I was there three times fo
r mi ne granddau ghter™s Bas Mitzvah, mine grandson™s Bar 
Mitzvah, we went there back, th
e last couple of years, yeah. 
Q: When  you were younge
r, and you were in the Zionist organization -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- did you have any sort of dream of 
one day going to Israel, and living Israel? 
A: Yeah, that -- that was our goal, but 
how many could go? On e -- maybe one -- one 
from each town. That was our go
al to go to Israel, that was we were dreaming about it. 
We was real organized in that time. But I 
wasn™t the youngest 
grou, and were older 
people wi -- that did emigrate to Israel. 
So they make like two people can go on one 
certificate if they got married, 
and they come to Israel, a
nd they  dissolve it. So, older 

people did go, yeah, from mine town. Bu t we di
dn™t have a chance yet, you know. People 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
51
 
 
 
wanted to go to Israel, but 
they wouldn™t let us in. Reme
mber Vivian from England? He 
didn™t want to upset the Arabs, to
 let in Jewish people to Israel. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you ever -- did you ever feel a
ny regret that you didn™t wind up in Israel 
instead of here, or -- 
A: No, I don™t feel a regret, I tell y ou. I don™t 
think I could take the climate there, it™s very 
hot. When I was there about 25
 years ago, I got very sick. I didn™t know th e climate, I 
went in the summer. A nd I didn™t
 thought I™ll make it home alive, th at™s how sick. I could 
not breathe. I -- I could not take the -- if -- 
in Jerusalem a little bett
er, but in Tel Aviv, 
impossible. An-An-And I tell my  friends that
 -- they were saying I lay on the floor, I 
couldn™t breathe, I -- they says to me, ﬁ We 
here a couple years already.ﬂ I says, ﬁYou got 
adjusted, but I didn™t.ﬂ I was very sick, but I 
went back  for the kid™s Bar Mitzvah, and th e 
Bas Mitzvah, we went back. 
Q: When  you were -- one ques
tion the mu seum had was, when
 you were in the ghetto, 
before you were sent to Auschwitz -- 
A: Yeah, yeah? 
Q: How long were you in th
e ghetto, do you remember?  
A: A year. I live with horses in a stable, beca
use they put in from ea
ch town there, and 
there was no way to go in. Like
 in one room lived [indeciphe
rable] 10 fam
ilies. Sowe 
were the last ones. When the German brough
t us over there -- should I tell you how we 
got on the -- on the boat? We have a -- a castle in
 our town, with  kings used to live there, 
now it™s for -- then it was for recreation. So th
ey took all the Jews into that castle, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
52
 
 
 
locked the door. Then 
they start to [indeciph
erable] the people, if everybody™s dead. If a 
baby fell down, and somebody picked up, they 
both got show. Got to 
be quiet. Then, by 
going out from the door [indecipherable] door, wa
s stan ding in the black uniform, with 
the rifles, b eating up everybody. Blood was ru
nning like water. Then th
ey put us on top. 
Between us was a doctor, he came from Germany,
 I think he got one artificial leg. They 
throw him on th e ground, and th ey step on his 
face with the boots. 
That doctor came to 
Auschwitz. We do -- we would do the same thin
g, he got the pills. He, his wife, his child, 
commit suicide right away, when 
he came into Au schwitz. We didn™t have that, he have 
it. 
Q: You didn™t have what? 

A: Pills to commit suicide. They
 took us in the ghetto -- so
 they watched for 20 minutes, 
they going to beat up people, 
they have to find a place. 
But there was no place where to 
go, so we run in  a stable, and we live in a st
able almost a year. No
thing to eat, people 
were dying from typhus. The only 
thing is they open 
up a kitchen, the Jewish people open  
up a kitchen, give a little bit soup, every
body. We was begging th e German, why don™t 
you kill us? He says, ﬁNo, we need the bu
llets on the front. You 
going to die ever -- 
anyway.ﬂ That was in the ghe tto. And then, from the ghetto, 
took us to [indecipherable] 
overn ight, and right on the -- on the trains, on 
those closed trains, there were people you -
- women used to give urine to drink, the ba
bies was crying for water. No water, keep us 
like that, locked up fo
r three days. Dark, no bathroom, 
no nothing. Half of them die 
anyway. And then the -- everythi
ng they did at night. They  pu
t on the train at night, we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
53
 
 
 
come to os -- we didn™t know where we were
, we didn™t know what™s going on. And right 
away was selection. Let™s say we come up 3,0
00 people in a train. They only pick up a 
hundred wo men, a hundred  men. The rest have
 to go to the gas chamber. So we didn™t 
know -- I wa -- right away, didn™t see my pa
rents, nothing, was dark. We have to  put 
down our suitcases, w h atever somebody got, 
and they only pick ed 
up 200, and the rest 
have to go. You could be young
, you could be strong, it didn™t matter. That™s how it was. 
And then we find out when we came there, 
that™s the -- the gas ch
amber is working day 
and night, for 24 hours. Day and night. You kn
ow, people were standing
 in the line, they 
begged to go in already. No
 washrooms, winter, it™s cold, 
children are crying, they beat 
you up. They want to  get over 
with it, alread y. They sing
 the Haptikvah, they  know 
where they going, they see the flames, and a 
few minutes later, it will happen to them. So 
people don™t understand all these things. Peop
le who wasn™t there could never visualize. 
Now, everything is p -- fixed up, [indecipher
able] taken. Can™t -- they can™t visualize 

those things. Day and night, we
re six crematoriums work ing.
 But when the 
war comes to 
an end, they  took ap art five, so nobody sh
ould know there was six. They  only left one. 

They  didn™t manage to liquidate the one. 

Q: Mm-hm. Today, or -- you know, let™s say 
the last few years, or whatever, do you -- 
just in your day to day life -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Do you think of 
this very often? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
54
 
 
 
A: Yeah. You dream at night all the time. I --
 sometime I scream at night. I -- I feel like 
I™m going to hide, I want to run. It™s 
all the time with that. It never goes out. 
[indecipherable] to my  daughter when I sleep
 [indecipherable] come 
in and wake me up, 
I™m happy, because when you 
dream, it looks like real. A nd sh e waked me up, I said, 
ﬁThank you. It™s good you woke me up. I slee
p ala -- alone here, alw -- always ba -- it 
never goes away from your mind. Like you™re
 running, you [indecipherable] selection, 
you here and there. Never go
es away, those things, never. 
Q: How often do you have these nightmares? 
A: A lot of ha -- of the times. All the time I 
dream that I™m with th
e camp , we going to 
hide it, we going to  run. We -- we go out 
from the ghetto, maybe -- maybe we™ll run here, 
maybe we™ll run here, and they -- running af
ter the -- always the -- the scary thing. 
Q: Mm-hm. You know, now, in th
is -- in this country now --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- especially, you know, lately -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- when traumatic things have happened  to  people -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- there™s a disaster, or -- you know -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- school shootings, or -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
55
 
 
 
Q: -- you know, terrible things that happen. 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: They -- instantly th
ey send counselors in. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Psychologists, and therapists. 
A: We haven™t got none of the -- and a lot of 
-- and a lot of people were very depressed, 
and nobody knew about it. We didn™t know even
 [indecipherable] thing. No , we didn™t 
have any help, nothing. No t when  
we came, no, nothing like that. 
Q: Have you ever thought, in
 years since, about maybe seeing a counselor, talking ab out 
this sort of thing, or not? 

A: No, no. 
Q: That™s -- that™s too different? 
A: Beca -- no, because we don™t believe really
, in that, you know. It™s all behind, you 
know, and a lot of people kind 
of pull out, which is a miracle.
 A lot of my friends -- I had 
a friend from Alsia. She said, ﬁI can™t believe 
it, what you went through, that you -- you 
got that guts to go to wo rk, and make money,
 raise a family.ﬂ But 
wh en you depend on 
yourself, then you do it. When
 you drowning, you try to pi
ck yourself up, no help from 
nobody. So, it™s a mira
cle [indecipherable] people, but 
not everybody did it. A lot of -- 
end up institution, a lot of my 
friend end up insti -- one of 
my friend which she help me, 
when  I dig out mine uncles at the -- and I wa
nt to send her to Israel, send her a present. 
She was a nice -- she took me to the house. 
They took away a girl
 from [indecipherable] 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
56
 
 
 
and she -- when they to
ok her away. In the 
camp s, the only thing wanting th ey have a 
piece of bread to eat, but after the war, when
 she came to  Israel, she went up in 
institution. Beautiful, yo
ung woman. And I don™t think if sh
e is still alive -- as a matter of 
fact, the husband survived, to
o. They both survived . And he
 was a very religious man. 
They went up in Israel. But a lo
t of people that was in the 
institution in Israel, a lot of 
them. 
Q: Why do you think that
 you didn™t wind up in an ins
titution, or go crazy from all this? 
A: Well, I tell you why. I have one thing in  mi
nd, is to work, and to  make money, and not 
to be poor any mo re. I concentrate on th
is, you know. That was it, you know? 
Q: So you put all your energy in to that? 

A: Yeah, yeah, I worked all the time. I didn™
t want to think ab out nothing else, only to 
work , and to make money, b
ecause if you have money, you 
can live a betli -- a better life, 
you know, and that™s what
 I try. My kids went to college, 
the piano lessons. I tried to give 
them everything what I didn™t have. 
Q: Mm-hm. You talked about
 the nightmares you have. 
A: Yeah, all the time. 
Q: But what about -- wh at about wh en you
™re awake, and just, 
you know, doing things 
around the apartment, 
or whatever, do you -- 
A: No, only wh en I lay down  to sleep. Yo
u know, I am working, so I am busy, so 
occupied with my work
, so I can think of something else. I got to concentrate what I do. 
But wh en  I lay down  and sleep
, all the time I have dreams. 
I -- I am amazed, myself. And 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
57
 
 
 
-- and sometime, I almost cry. 
I -- I™m in such a bad situati
on, I start to run, here™s a 
selection, here™s this, and it always comes ba
ck, it™s so r eal, it™ s so r eal when it comes 
back. So when I ge
t up, I says, ﬁOy, thanks God I™m out of it,ﬂ you know? 
Q: In these dreams, are they -- are the -- are 
the dreams made up of th ings you actually 
saw, or it™s just sort of -- it puts you in the place, and -- 
A: No, it puts me in the place where I was sta
nding for selection. Wehave to stay naked, 
winter, in the coldest day. If you have a 
little pimple on the body , you was gone. That 
was -- one time they told -- I work in ausch 
-- in Birkenau, I work
 by bricks, with the 
tuchkas you know, schlep brick? I work by 
that. One time they ann
ounced they need 50 
girls. So I said maybe I™ll have luck to go 
to work [indecipherable]. I stand there, and I 
find out, one of my  friends from Czechoslova
kia come over, she said
, ﬁRun away. They 
need 50 girls to ster
ilize them.ﬂ So when
 it™s 20,000 people on the one ground, you can 
get lost. So I kind of turned  out away, and I run away from
 there. A lot of from mine 

town , many women got sterilized, yeah. 
Q: What about when there are documentaries 
on TV about the Holocaust, or this movie, 
like ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ or other -- 
A: Yes, I went there, yeah. I we -- I saw ﬁ 
Schindler™s List.ﬂ I™m 
very happy that they 
showed the list, but I tell you, it™s actually a piece of cake comp ared  to Au schwitz and 

Birkenau. At least they didn™
t stay by selection. They  didn™t watch me -- people get 
burned all the time. They suffered too, they  ha
ve to live on rationing. They  went to work . 
They  wasn™t beaten up like we were beaten
 up. One time, I j -- I don™t know. We get a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
58
 
 
 
piece of bread, we didn™t know should we eat
 it up, or take each time a crumb. Maybe I 
took a crumb t -- he noticed that, I don™t know. 
I was sitting, he gave me with the rifle, 
maybe 10 times over the head. I lost mine cons
cious, he was sure that I am dead already. 
Then he walked away. And I 
see black rings on mine face. Then mine girls came over, 
and says, ﬁOh, you still alive, come over.ﬂ 
The whole face was bloody, the whole head 
was bloody. I didn™t even know, we didn™t ha
ve a mirror, we didn
™t know. So when I 
came back to the camps, ﬁOh, y
ou probably were beaten up 
today. Look at what,ﬂ -- I 
says, ﬁYes, I was beaten up. I don™t know w
hy, but I was.ﬂ They  always had to  catch 
somebody. It™s a miracle. I -- I used to 
suffer on headaches for many years, on terrible 
headaches, because it -- 
it is injure you eventually, not
 only emotionally, but physically, 
too. 
Q: Yeah. If you just sit down and 
tu rn on th e TV, or something -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- or if you™re goin g around th e channels
, and th ere happens to be some program on 
about the war -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the Holocaust, or whatever -- 
A: I™ll never miss it.  
Q: So you watch them? 

A: Never miss it. I think it™s a crime to mi
ss it. You know, it™s [indecipherable] people, 
and they  tell them, ﬁHow can you watch that? I can™t watch it.ﬂ I says, ﬁIf you don™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
59
 
 
 
watch it, you commit a crime. 
How would the people who was 
in those closed up train, 
and give the kids urine to drink, we was st
arving, they  went through it, you can™t even 
watch it? And you sit on a comfortable couc
h, and you™re not hungry?ﬂ I never missed 
anything, I always watch, and call right away my
 friends to watch it, too. I think if I don™t 
watch it, I commit a crime.
 That™s the way I feel. 
Q: Did you always feel that way? I mean
 y-you know, years a
go you said you never 
talked about this, or you hard ly ever talked about -- 
A: No, I didn™t talk, but I™m glad now they 
show on television certain things, that I™m 
glad they  show -- one time, only one time they
 show on television, how the people, wh en 
they put them in the 
crematorium.  They  didn™t show how 
they fall out, the bodies. That™s 
one time they show. I think they don™t want to
 show, because people don™t want to watch 
this thing. So they di
dn™t show it any time, that™s the 
only time when -- I never witched -- 
I never miss it, I always watc
h it. Those people suffer, and 
th e other people can™t even 
watch it? I think that™s a crime. That™s 
the -- why I tell everyb
ody, but the American 
people tell me, ﬁYou shouldn™t watch it, you sh
ouldn™t watch it. I couldn™t do th at. I -- I 
don™t want to see that.ﬂ I was in Florida, a 
-- a people come in to 
see -- it was a film -- I 
forgot, a certain film. They sa
w the film, they like [indeciphera
ble] then they talk to each 

other, then they start to co
 -- show from the camp. If I kne
w that, I wouldn™t even  go 
there. That™s how I was talking. 
Q: Wait, I -- I didn™t follow that. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
60
 
 
 
A: In Florida last year, they show nice thing,
 all of a sudden they  start to show from the 
camp. Who wants to see them? We don™t want to
 see that. I walk over to her, I said, ﬁYou 
very lucky. You didn™t have to feel it, not onl
y see it. You were see it. You don™t want to 
see how other people -- that™s not
 nice.ﬂ I told them right away. Oh, we can™t take it, what 
can I tell, w e can™t take it. People don™t lik
e to see sad things, you know? Bu t I never 
miss it, if they show a few m -- anything
 on television, I never miss it, never.  
Q: Did you, in -- in the years 
you™ve been living here, and -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- all the years since the war, did you ever ha
ve the feeling, or did you ever worry that 
something like that could happen  again? 

A: Of course. You rememb er a couple year
s ago, Skokie here, builded a -- he was a 
Jewish guy, he come from a Jewish family, the guy, wh at he orgaz -- what was his name? 

I don™t rememb er. He organized the Nazi
s, they™re going to come. Well most 
[indecipherable] l ives i n  Skokie, maybe 20 per
cent live there, 80 wa -- they decided that™s 
not Europe, here we™re going 
to fight back. But the poli
ce surrounded them, you know, 
they want to talk. So we organized ours
elf, everybody come w
ith stones, in the 
[indecipherable] and we start to throw stones
. They  ran aw ay, they  didn™t have a chance 
[indecipherable] 

Q: You™re talking about -- I think this wa
s about wh at, 20 years or so ago, wh en  -- 
A: Fifteen. 

Q: -- a local group of Nazis -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
61
 
 
 
A: About fifteen years, I think -- 
Q: -- right, was marching in -- in Skokie. 

A: -- yeah, so -- yeah, y
eah, no, they couldn™t come in here. Yeah, they couldn™t come in 
here, because here lives refugee, and they says
 here we live in a free country, we not -- 
we not going to let them do it. And they did it. 

Q: So, did you thro w stones? 

A: Yeah. I came with all my frien ds. Whole 
packets of them. They
 ran away, the police 
ran away. They was afraid they
™re going to be killed here, y
eah. In Europe you couldn™t 
do th at, but here we could do 
it. That™s the difference. 
Q: Did you -- did you yell at them? 

A: No, it -- we threw stone -- they was far aw
ay, you know, they put up a pla -- they got 
so many stones, they ran away 
with the light. They would be 
killed if they stand up to 
throw, that was sure. He was arrested, that 
guy, later on, because he was a gay man, or 
something. So he was arrested, I 
-- I think he™s still in jail. 
Q: How many stones did you th row? 

A: A lot. A lot. We took -- filled pocket.  All my neighbors came. I don™t think one 

refugee remain in the house in that time. 
I didn™t live here in 
that time, I live in 
[indecipherable] Park. But we 
all came here, and we was wa
iting for them. And wis -- we 
organized ourself in -- you know
, in the shuls, and here and 
there, they™re not going to 
take -- let them take care of us here. That™s it.  

Q: After s -- and then they ran away? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
62
 
 
 
A: Oh, they ran away. They 
didn™t come back any mo re. Th
ey  knew they going to be 
killed if they come here, that™s it. 
Q: So when you were heaving ro
cks at them or whatever -- 
A: Yeah, a lot of rocks. 
Q: Did it feel good? 
A: Yes, it makes me  feel good. Here you co ul
d speak up, and we do 
something. In Poland 
we couldn™t do noth ing. With the Germans,
 we couldn™t do noth ing. They have the 
ammunition, we have nothing. But a lot of Je
wish people fought in there, in the woods, 
and all over, they fought. 
Q: Do you follow things in th
e news? Like, for instance, no
w, in the last few months, 
there™s been the war in Serbia, 
and Koso vo, and all that, and -- 
A: Yes. Yeah. I follow all the time the news
. I want to tell you so mething. I am really 
surprised that even one Jew re
mains in Europe. They had a ch
ance to go to Israel, to 
South America, here. Not one 
Jew -- because always wars over there, especially against 
the Jews. If the economy du -- is 
not good, it™s the Jew™s fault.
 Like in Russia now. If the 
economy, the Jews -- the Jews, all the Jews, it
™s all their fault. Th
ey shouldn™t remain 
there. They have no business. I know th ey di
 -- the JUF tried to help him -- take him, 
whatever they do, but 
they had [indecipherable] they ha
d no business to be in Europe. 
After the se cond war, nobody shouldremain in Europe, that™s it. 

Q: So, the United States, and the NATO co
untries, they intervened in Kosovo. 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
63
 
 
 
Q: And one of the reasons that peopl
e like President Clinton have said -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that they have don
e it is that they -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- you know, cannot permit this
 kind of atrocity to happen. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: When  you -- wh en you see this happen to day -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- does it make you think about -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- all those years ago, an
d why nothing happened th en ? 
A: Yeah, no -- nobody, no. 
Nobody, no, nobody. Rooseve
lt was a big anti-Semite, he 
didn™t let the Jews come to talk to him. 
They knew wh at™s going 
on very well, but they  
didn™t -- because they only k
illed Jews, it™s all right. The 
government didn™t do -- they 
turned back a boat, and the pe
ople commit suicide. That™s -- 
that™s how they help. Now, 
it™s like that. After the second World War, they
 fought against the Germans, the other 
side. He™s a bad guy, but he fought against 
the German. The others 
cooperate with hi -- 
with Hitler. But I don™t like to 
see people be killed by -- like one lady says her father was 
a teacher, they took him out -- I don™t like to
 see people to go in
 and go out from the 
house, otherwise you get killed, the young 
people get killed. I don™t care about the war, 
but I don™t like to see it. And I™m glad that 
the world wake up. Came an Englishman on 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
64
 
 
 
television, he -- he™s not even 30 years old, 
he said, the politicians have plenty on their -- 
on th eir conscience wh at they didn™t do on
 the second Wo rld War, now th ey woke up, 
finally, and a lot of people slaughter. At least th ey gave them a help. Us, we just went to 
the gas chambers, nobody raise a finger, noth
ing. The trains was 
going day and night, 
nobody helped us. If th
ey ran to the woods, 
they was killed by the Po
lish people, too. So 
I™m glad when I see that, I™m gl
ad what I see that, yes. They
 rise up and -- and -- and they  
do so mething about it. 
Q: Do you think that -- especi
ally I think in the last 10 or
 15 years, there™s been a lot 
more talk, a lot more -- 
mo re films, documentaries, books, whatever, about the 
Holocaust? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: More people talking about it,
 do you th ink that that has ha
d an y affect on things like, 
you know, them intervening Ko sovo now,
 that it™s a result of -- of that? 
A: Yeah, I thi -- yeah, people 
speak up now, which they didn
™t speak for many years, and 
I™m gl -- I am glad, because lot -- how long we
 going to be on this
 earth? People are 75 - 
76. People are dying every -- here, just in 
Skokie, three of the people -- three of the 
refugees die already. I went to a meeting.
 People are dying, wouldn™t be nobody to tell 
the stories. I™m glad that they -- I went to
 Washington with -- wa
s thinking about building 
a mu seum, in that time the beginning, and I was 
very happy th at the -- the result is good. 
I™m very happy to see that. But a future gene
ration, they should st
and up, and not let a -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
65
 
 
 
something like that happen, because never, ne
ver in the history happen wh at™s happened 
in the Jews, in the second World War. So
mething like that never happened before. 
Q: Have you ever gotten -- some of the people
 I interview, they ge
t calls from schools or 
whatever -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- to come -- come a
nd talk to our class -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- about what happened, 
wh atev  -- do you ever get an
y of those calls, or -- 
A: No, I™m not really a speaker, you know. I do
n™t think I™d ma -- I think I -- I -- I n -- I 
can™t do that, I don™t think so. 

Q: Well, you™re doing okay here. 
A: Yeah. Maybe are people more qualif
ied, you know, to do those things. 
Q: But you haven™t been  
-- no one™s ever asked you? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: If some teacher did call you, and say, w
hy d -- I heard about you somehow, would you 
come and talk to my  class, would you go? 
A: Yeah, yeah, if they ask me, I probably will.
 Yes, if they ask me, I probably . I tell you, 
I went to a lecture after the war, I don™t reme
mb er the name of the guy, and he says like 
that, there isn't enough paper yink -- paper an
d ink, to put down what™s happened in the 
second World War. No  matter how
 many book, that™s impossible. It™s just impossible. 
Q: We -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045

A: The people have to dig their own grav
es, you know, near Ru
ssia, where the -- the 
people have to dig their own graves, and jump
 in, and they -- and they shot them. They 
enjoy it, they™re very sadistic people. They  us
ed to take babies, and throw in the air, and 
shot them like birds. They ve
ry sadistic people, the German. And I still think they still 
are. I don™t believe them. 
Q: You don™t think they ™ve changed? 

A: I wasn™t -- I was mad when th
ey took away 
the wall from -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Lonia Mosak. This is tape number two, side B. We -- 
A: The people have to dig their own grav
es, you know, near Ru
ssia, where the -- the 
people have to dig their own graves, and jump
 in, and they -- and they shot them. They 
enjoy it, they™re very sadistic people. They  us
ed to take babies, and throw in the air, and 
shot them like birds. They ve
ry sadistic people, the German. And I still think they still 
are. I don™t believe them. 
Q: You don™t think they ™ve changed? 
A: I wasn™t -- I was mad when
 they took away the wall fro
m Germany, you know, they  
have a dividing wall with the Russian, put 
up a wall, East Germany. They  should never 
take away the wall. I saw a woman came on te
levision from England, and she said that 
was -- that wall should never be taken away
, it was a protection for certain -- for other 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
67
 
 
 
walls. A security, like they say, 
a security blanket. They shou
ld never take away the wall, 
made the Germans strong ag ain. Because the 
-- Germany is the richest country  in the 
world. They took aw ay ever
ybody from the people. If you ha
ve a gold teeth in your 
mouth, they  took out. If you have
 a watch, if you have a ring,
 di -- everything took away. 
They ™re going to  have for generation, genera
tion, what they have. They robbed the whole 
yeero, the bank, everything, 
they to ok over everything. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you don™t like the 
notion of Germany getting stronger? 
A: No, no. They  should never ta
 -- I was alw ays against -- they took away -- and a lot of 
people come on television, English people, fame
 -- that said no, that was a big mistake. 
They  should be never strong, 
because they start two World 
Wars already. And you never 
know the future. You know 
how anti-Semitic they are no
w? When they ga -- they 
organized themselve? Th
ey admire Hitler, an d everything
. They didn™t have a lesson. 
This -- and a lot of them got big govern ment j
obs, but they were in -- in the Gestapo, and 
they change their name, they 
got bi-big jobs there. How 
can you trust these people? I 
would never trust them. They  -- they came in
, a German, to my house, we weren™t rich. 
He told me to open up 
the drawers, he want to take away
 everything. I says, here is, take 
this, take this, take -- h e says, ﬁNo. Wher
e did you -- where did you stack your better 
stuff?ﬂ I said we were not rich, we didn™t ha
ve any better stuff. So he says, ﬁYou know, I 
was here in the first World War. They ch ased  us out in this country , but this time we 
staying here forever.ﬂ That™s how -- they wa
s sure of themself. They occupied  whole 
Europe. That™s how [indecipherable] that wa
s a man ma ybe 60 years old. He was in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
68
 
 
 
first World War, they were su
re, they were so 
hypnotized they were
 going to  -- they 
going to  counter the whole wo rld. 
Q: Let™s just -- before we -- I™m -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- I™m ru nning out of que
stions, but before we -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- leave off, I just want to make sure 
-- we talked about how 
you got over here -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and how you were working -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and that you had children and all -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and then we started talking about other 
things. I mean, there™s a lot of years went 
by. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah
, that™s for sure. 
Q: Any interesting things in th
ere that you want to -- that 
you want to talk about, or 
mention? 

A: Well, I™m glad I™m in this country, and I 
could build a life, and 
live a better life. I™m -- 
I™m happy for that, that I could do it, 
you know? Most of the people did it. 
[indecipherable] they know they  can™t depend 
on nobody, and they  have
 to pick themself 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
69
 
 
 
up, on straps like they say, and do it on th
eir own, and this country  give you an  
opportunity for that. So I™m ve
ry grateful for that, yeah. 
Q: When  you came over here, did you beco me a citizen right away ? 
A: No, it takes five years. I didn™t know th e 
language then. We have to -- we went to 
night school, we went to school, we lear
ned the language. Five years later we became 
citizens, yeah. 

Q: What -- did you have differe
nt activities, o r hobbies, or what would you do for fun, 
you know? 

A: Oh. Oh yes, we -- we or
ganized ourself. We got organi
zations in the newcomers. 
Yeah, I was -- last week -- I™m going next week
 to the -- how you call it, the new citizen -
- we call it the new citizen, B™nai Brith, the -- 
all this, have meeting once a mo nth, if you 
-- I always attend those meeti
ngs, we always go th ere. We organized themselves, yeah, 
all the time. We stay together, like the re
fugees stay together
 all the time, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you -- before the war, were you very religious? 
A: Well, my parents was very religious, I wa
s mo re progressive. I belonged to a Zionist 
organization, they called the Sh emiratsier. Th
ey was not that relig
ious. Traditional, but 
not religious, not like that. Like, you couldn™t
 take a pencil, write o n  Saturday, or do 

things like that, ride a bike. We did it, we 
did those things, yeah. But in they -- in the 
same time, the older peoples in the organiza
tion was well educated, so they teach us, we 
got courses, all kind of courses, book 
reviews. Was very interesting, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
70
 
 
 
Q: Did th at cause any problems with your 
parents, that you were in this sort of 
progressive group -- 
A: No, I di -- I -- 

Q: -- and they were more religious? 
A: They didn™t like it, they di
dn™t like it, but we did our own way, yeah. They  didn™t like 
it, but in the house we were religious, I di
dn™t do noth ing t -- agains
t them. But when we 
went out with the group, or we ride 
a bike, they didn™t know about it.  
Q: With all you, you know, 
lived through during the war -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- and ev erything you saw, did that ch
ange the way you th ought about God, or -- 
A: Yeah, it did change, but I want to tell you 
so mething. We didn™t believe in God wh en 
we was in Auschwitz, when  we saw what™s goi
ng on, but when I come
 to this country, 
and I have children, you sti 
-- you have to hang up the little 
tradition. It gives you a little, 
you know, there a lot of thin
gs wh at™s going bad in life. 
There are sickness, all -- you 
have to hang up with  something. So I de
cided we should hang up to something, and 
believe in God. It™s a little bit easier, the 
life is easier. B u t you get very sick, oy God 
should I get bet -- should I get better, maybe I™
ll get out of it. So you always mention that. 
But deep  in hearts, people didn™t believe it, no. 

Q: In Au schwitz, you say, people didn™t believe -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- did you believe before
 you went to the camp? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
71
 
 
 
A: Yeah, before yeah, but not 
after that, when I saw, no. 
No, nobody believed in there. 
Q: Why did you feel that way? 
A: Because we couldn™t see the young [indeci
pherable] the young kids, and crying, and 
people go to the gas ch amber. That™s wasn™t
 -- there is something 
could control that, you 
know what I mean? The Germ
ans used to tease us, ﬁYou 
see what we have on our 
buckle? God is with us, not with
 you.ﬂ That™s what they told
 us. And when the airplanes 
start to circle in Auschwitz, and we was l
ooking, they  said, ﬁWhat are you looking fo r? 
12 -- 12 -- 12 o™clock, the worl
d will be -- all be -- you™ll be killed 15 minute before 12. 
That was their intention to do. If the world woul
dn™t come to an end, another year or two, 
nobody would surv ive, no way. Ho
w long can you starve like that? 
Q: So in  the camp you decided there™s no God. 
A: No, that™s something -- 
Q: Then wh en you have 
kids, you feel like well -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- you know, you should
 hang onto some tradition. 
A: Yeah, that™s was mine idea. 
Q: -- but does that mean -- does that mean
 you started to believe in God again? 
A: Well, yes. Maybe, maybe yes. I wanted th
e kids to have a traditions. I f -- I felt the 
holid ays and everything, just like my  parents did, yeah . 

Q: Mm-hm, but is it just, you know, you want 
the tradition, or you -- I™m -- I™m just 
trying to  get, did -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
72
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- do you believe th
ere is a God now? 
A: Now I believe it, yes, now I believe it, even
 though in that time 
I didn™t. When you see 
bad things happen, you don™t believe. Then
 you ch ange your mi
nd, maybe there is 
something, yeah. 

Q: But then, where was he? 

A: Yeah, that™s what we ask, our questions, a
ll the time. Even the re
ligious people in the 
camp, women, they were very 
religious. But now, wh
en I come to Florid
a, and I sit on the 
bench near the ocean, and I se
e a lot of men with long bear
ds, with numbers, they very 
religious, and th ey suffered during the war, 
but they very religio
us now. They said, 
ﬁThanks God I wasn ™t a German, 
I didn™t have too good a job.ﬂ That™s what they tell me. 
Because I talk to -- when I see a number, I go
 over, talk to them. 
[indecipherable] this 
thing. Yeah.  

Q: Do you -- you have to actually -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- press that button. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you think that there is any an
swer that can explain the Ho locaust? 
A: No, no, I don™t think so. Did -- people di
dn™t foresee that. There was a lot of young 
men, if they knew what™s coming, they would 
do something, they wo
uld go in the woods, 
and run. Nobody forseed it, because the German
s was lying to us. They
 told us we just 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
73
 
 
 
going to  take -- take another place for war. Th
ey was lying. Then th
ey open up atellager 
in Auschwitz, or they took in
 kids like in a kinderg arten, a
nd all the thing -- they promise 
them all in the world, you see,
 if the Red Cross come, we have
 kids here, we have good -- 
everything was covered up, like in Theresienstadt
, too. And then  they 
took the people to -
- to -- the -- the people was fighting [ind
ecipherable] bare naked. They says, ﬁYou 
promised us, we [indecipherable] why you do it to us?ﬂ So they wa
s beaten up over the 
head. They  didn™t have it what
 to fight. That was before th
e Russians came  in, t o ok away 
those people. 
Q: So, do you think it was just this 
tremendous evil, and there was -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- there™s no other explan ation, or -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. A lot of people I know, from mi ne town, intelligent peop
le, they belong to 
a Socialist organization befo re the war, they
 came to Auschwitz, a
nd they went to the 
electric wire. They said, ﬁIn a world like that, 
we don™t have to live. It™s no use. Doesn™t 
pay to live in a world like that, we all going
 to be killed anyway.ﬂ
 And they were big 
organizers, bele -- believe in 
Socialism and all these things
. Very intelligent people, and 
that™s what they did. 

Q: Could you tell us again about 
when you were in Bialystok? 
A: Yeah, that -- I was in Bialystok, yeah
. That™s where the police brought us, and 
ammunition, I have to learn how to use a gun 
to defend ourself, because he told us it™s 
going to  be a pogrom there. And you know w
hy, they  told  us. A lot of wo men put their 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
74
 
 
 
babies to Po lish families. Let™s say a brother, 
a nephew, survived  the 
war in Russia, they 
came back for the child, 
the child was already five, six year
s old, the child didn™t want to 
go. So they steal the kids out.
 They came in the uniform, a
nd they  took th em by force, to 
the German border, into Israel. So they decide
d the people killed their kids, to have blood 
for matzos at Passover. They ri
ght away have an excuse, you 
know. And that™s when  they  
brought in ammunition, we sh
ould defend -- we can do nothi
ng, it™s going to be a pogrom 
here. That™s when I took my  brother, went 
to Warsaw, and I know that the Bricha is 
waiting for the people, to ta
ke them across the border.  
Q: Mm-hm. So you -- you left Bialystok at that point? 
A: Yeah, then they come after us, too. Little
 by little, they all left. There was no place to 

stay there now, any more. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The life was in danger. 

Q: While you™ve been  living in  this country
, d -- have you -- do you travel mu ch, just 
even on vacations go 
overseas, or what? 
A: Well, I used to go with my  daughter t
ogether, and I go to  Florida with my  friends. 
That™s how far it™s going. 
Q: Right. Did you ev er make a
ny trips to any part of Europe? 
A: No, I wouldn™t go back there, no. 

Q: Not any part? 

A: No. I hate those people, I d
on™t want to see those faces.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 
 
75
 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. I think that™s about
 it for any of my  questions. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Is there anything that we didn™t 
talk about, or that you want to add? 
A: What can I add? I to ld you the whole st
ory. I™m -- I™m happy that I™m here. I got a 
chance to make money, and build 
up a -- to have a nice place 
to live. I™m s
till work, I like 
to work. I™m very lucky to have two 
daughters, two children, you know? And 
grandchildren, that™s -- I™m very lucky, wh
ich I never dream of that. We never dreamed 
that we going to ever live freely. Every day I 
get up, an d I says to myself, ﬁI can™t believe 
it, I™m free, that I can do whatever I want, I go t what to eat.ﬂ We always think about that, 

never goes away. 

Q: You know one thing I wa
s wondering about is -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- your story, and in fact, ever
y other person I™ve talked to -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- they talk so much ab
out the food, and how there wa
sn™t food, and if you got a 
potato, or an extra piece of br
ead, or something like that -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, that was the life. 

Q: -- does that -- do you still have sort of a special -- 
A: Yeah, I -- I --  

Q: -- feeling about fo od?

A: Yeah, I can™t see people thro
w away food. That wi -- that hurts me terrible. Because 
there™s still people in the wo
rld what is starving now, still.
 No, I can never throw away 
food. No, I -- I think I commit a crime if 
I throw out food, beca
use I remember how 
hungry we was. We was only -- when  we was 
in Auschwitz, we only
 have one pray in 
our life, to have a whole bread, and cut as mu
ch as we want. We didn™t think about a -- a 
bed clean, our clothes, nothing ex
ists in your head, only  if to have a bread, and to cut as 
much as you wanted. Before th
e war finished, the German us
ed to di-divid
ed our bread 
for four. Later, they didn™t do 
that, they gave us small pum
pernickel for 10, you got to 
divide it for yourself. So a lot of groups figh
t over that, there was -- not mine group, mine 
group was very generous, and 
we made it every day somebody 
else will take the end of 
the bread. But we got along, 
everybody took a little slice over24 hour. But other people 
was fighting, and killing each other. They maki
ng little scale, and try to weigh the bread, 
and this and that. We didn™t do that. I was 
with my  own people, w
ith my own friends, so 
we didn™t do this. 
Q: So now you can eat as
 much as you want -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- anything you want. 
A: Now we™re afraid to eat. You got choleste
rol, you got this. Yeah, but I -- I can™t see 
throwing away food, no. 

Q: Mm. When you™re -- 

A: I always think about it, some pe
ople are still hungry in this world.

Q: When  you go to the grocery 
store, do you think ab out this? 
A: Yes, I buy -- I don™t buy too mu ch, becaus
e I don™t want to throw away. I only buy a 
little, becau se it hurts me if I have to throw away
 food. I -- I couldn™t do it. For six years, 
you know, starving. Six years. 
Even one hour when  a person 
is hungry is bad. When  we 
were standing by our selecti
on, if you were sk
inny, you have no ch
ance to live, the 
German hate skinny people. Bu t the women go
t an idea to drink a lot of water, as a -- 
have a big stomach. So we fooled the Germ
ans, oh you got a big stomach, you -- you still 
be able to work. So we fool
ed them, we mak e our cheeks 
red, to look better, you know. 
We tried to fool them this way. 
Q: Now, all the -- all th e yo
ung people today, everybody wa
nts to be skinny, everyone 
wants to be thin. 
A: Yeah, oh, yeah. Over there 
if you™re skinny, even a man, 
in the man™s ca
mp , a sk in ny  
person have no chan ce to surviv e, they ha
te skinny people. They gave them a name, 
mu sselman, that™s a -- mu sselm
an, the -- you™re skinny, you ha
ve no right to live. And I 
was chubby, that saved my life, too. I was 
always chubby. You kno
w, Europe, you give 
the kids to eat. If you™re skin
ny they thought you are hand
icapped. So every mother 
pushed th e food to her kids.  

Q: I believe you said earlier -- yo
u mentioned having grandchildren? 
A: Yeah, I have four gra
ndchildren. Each girl -- 
Q: How -- how old are they, what are their names?

that, yeah. Yeah, I™m very devoted to Israel. I 
would do anything for Israel. 
Q: Okay , well if there™s nothing else you want to add -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- then I guess that™s it. 
A: One of my  cousins, she die here -- on the 
way to Japan, you know. But she die here in 
the war. So he left me  2,000 dollars. So I ga
ve thousand dollars for Israel for scholarship , 
and thousand dollars for the mu seum

re than I do.

Q: Oh. 
A: No, never, I never really talk about it. So
metime w-we get together with my friends, 
we talk a little bit about it, a
nd sometimes some of them don™t 
want to even hear about it, 
ﬁOy, you make me sick , please don™t talk about it.ﬂ  
Q: So, well we™ve been talking 
about it for almo st two hours. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So how™s that make you feel now,
 do you feel better somehow, or -- 
A: No, I feel better that it™s going to be on 
paper, and it™s going to be a documen t for the 
future generation. So that™s how it makes me
 feel good. I don™t mind how many times I 
get interviewed, really. That doesn™t bother me
. You know, a lot of people -- of my friend 
can™t talk, they get very
 sick, they don™t want to hear 
about it. They have heart trouble 
here, they have high blood pr
essure, they didn™t want to be
 interview at all. I couldn™t 
convince them, but most of them I did convince, yeah. It™s very hard
 for some people to 
talk, you know, it™s very hard. Maybe I am
 strong in my natu
re, you know? But -- 
Q: Well, you™re not talking into  the microphone. 
A: Yeah, yeah. So I™m mar -- I talk about it, 
you know, if I have a 
chance, but my friends, 
a lot of them get sick, they don
™t want to hear about it. So
 if I see a film, they show 
something, I™m very happy. I went to see a 
film last year, ﬁIn Our Hands,ﬂ how the -- the 
Israeli society and th e English army , you kno
w, but not on the Isr
aeli [indecipherable] 
that they shouldn™t tell, but to the end, they
 raise up, and they says, ﬁWe going to fight 
our own flag.ﬂ And then  they mentioned how 
they took out the peop
le from Poland, that

group, but I was glad to see th
at, you know, a lot of people 
don™t know about it. Some of 
them don™t know about it. 
Q: Which group are yo
u talking about now? 
A: The Bricha, from Israel. 
Q: Oh. 
A: A couple of my friends were the survivor
 Auschwitz, they brough
t them uniforms, and 
they smuggled them in to Israel after the war. They still 
there in Israel, yeah. They did a 
lot, whatever they could, y
ou know? Actually , we very  proud
 to have our own country in 
Israel, and we should always 
support them. We see what™s happened wh en we don™t have 
a country. Now Israel go to ev
ery corner of the world where 
Jewish are in trouble, they 
take them out, they help them. We didn™t 
have it bef -- before, in the second Wo rld War. 
Nobody could help us. 

Q: Well listen, thanks agai
n for doing the interview. 

A: That you for interviewing me. 
Q: It™s a hot day, so now you can 
turn your air conditioner back on. 
A: Yeah.
