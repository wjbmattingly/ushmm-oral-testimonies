PAUL STRASSMAN 
 July 11, 1990
 
 
Q: Would you please tell me  your full name ?  
 

A:I'm Paul A. Strassma n. 

 

Q: Where were you born and when were you born? 

 

A:I was born, uh, January 24th, 1929 in Tren_ín [
Ger:
 Tr entschin] in Slovakia, which at that  
part...time was part of Czechoslovakia. 
 

Q:You can look at me .   

 

A:OK.  Fine.  OK.   

 

Q:Uh, Paul, would you tell me  about your parents and your family, your fa mily life as a young 
child? 
 

A:Uh my father uh was a very successful comma
nder of the local battalio
n in the First World 
War.  He wa s one of the very early educat
ed, university educated, uh, young people so he 
imme diately in the First World Wa r got a comm
i ssion in the Austro-Hungarian Army.  In 
those days the army consisted of local batt
alions, people from the same  town, from the 
same  province went together; and, uh, that 
goes back to the feudal ways, how armi es 
were organized.  Uh, my father, uh, brought ma
ny of the people from the local district 
back home a live and, uh, after the Fi rst World Wa r, he took his non-commissioned 

officers and, uh, set up a business where 
the non-commissioned officers from his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227

battalion became his distributors and my fa
ther was the wholesaler, and by 1930 my 
father dominated the, uh, the 
oil, fertilizer and, uh, uh, flour 
distribution business in the, 
in the entire province.  In 
the, uh, mi d-thirties, my  father became  a me mbe r  of the, uh, 
provincial governme nt, which was a part of...
it was a sort of supervisory governme nt on 
top of the bureaucracy and, uh, he became  very
 closely associated w
ith two priests, who, 
uh, subsequently figure very importantly in th
e events that happene
d sub...in the in the 
forties, and, uh, so my childhood was reall
y, uh... as the only son...I had an older 
sister...of a very well-known public figure,
 and, uh, from my ch
ildhood I was aware of 
my father's position and his military b
ackground, which again will figure very 
importantly in, in the events 
to come .  My mothe r  and, uh, my father worked together in 
the business.  They were very close partne
rs.  The business was downstairs and we lived 
upstairs and, uh, I went to a Jewish school. It was a Jewish elementary school, and had 
the usual normal childhood until, uh, 1936 when 
I decided to join HaShomer HaTzair, 
which was a youth organization which, uh, had very
 strong, uh, views of 
its, of its role in 
Israel , especi ally with regard to the notion 
of  HaShomer being the guardian.  Again, this 
is an important heritage because HaShomer 
HaTzair, uh, provided the backbone of all the 
Jewish guerrillas in, uh, Slovaki
a.  It it was sort of assu
med that, uh, HaShomer HaTzair 
will fi ght.   
 

Q:How did you as a young ma n feel about it 
and, uh, why did you become  involved in it? 
 

A:Involved with what? 

 

Q:HaSho me r  HaTzair. 

 

A:Oh, it's just uh...I don't know...you go with a certai
n crowd, uh, in a small town.  The...Tren_ín 
is a small town.  It's it's a provincial hea
d...uh, center of fourteen thousand people.  The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
3 
 
Jewish population in that town was about f
ourteen hundred.  Uh, there were not that 
many organizations and HaShomer HaTzair 
was very well organized and it was the 
organization and the people and, uh, the young pe
ople I gravitated to.  The other group 
was a religious group and, uh, although my mo
ther was very religious and was kosher 
and my grandfather always took me  to schul
, and I was a particularly good scholar, uh, 
my father and I were always sort of fairl
y, uh, liberal in our views from fr om the very 
childhood and therefore it was i
n...in...incomprehensible for 
me to join the the the 
religious part of the town.  In 
fact the Jews in Tren_ín were 
really divided into three sort 
of groups.  There were the the sort of conserva
tive.  Of course, this doesn't apply to the 
American definition of conservative.  Uh th
ere was reform conservative and then there 
was really the extremely religious Jews; 
and uh being uh very much involved in a 
community and uh with a father as a public 
figure and uh and partic
ularly leader of 
HaShomer HaTzair in Tren_ín uh who had quite
 a bit of training in Palmach, uh we we 
sort of were set up for this this kind of an experience.   
 
Q:Tell me  what happened to you as uh as 
things began to change in your town? 

 

A:Uh we had a...a very difficu
lt decision.  We  were going to l
eave in uh 1938. My father decided 
uh to leave and we were all set up to l
eave.  We  had passports and so forth. 
 

Q: What? 

 

A:Uh my father was a fairly astute individual 
and he felt that the situation was untenable and 
becomi ng more so.  Uh he uh uh interpreted 
the the the the experiences in Germany and 
Austria uh much more correctly than others did 
and he just did not feel
 that he wanted to 
to risk hi s family uh to the uh to the sort 
of experience that wa s happening in Germany 
and uh so we were going to leave uh the uh...w
e were sort of stashing money away.  My 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
4 
 
my mother, who was always the treasurer of
 the uh of the, of the fa mily...as we got 
money and change it into foreign currency ... 
you know, uh mother took it and put it into 
a a me tal box which she uh hid upstairs in the at
tic.  The week when we were supposed to 
leave in 1938, she went up to 
withdraw the mone y.  The box had fallen behind a radiator.  
It was a steam radiator; neve
rtheless the me tal box focused the heat out of the steam 
radiator and all the mone y that was in ther
e, which was our escape money, was charred 
and my father never said a bad word about it
.  In addition to that, there we re uncles and 
grandparents and the whole family...my father wa
s sort of the kapo of the fa mily, I mean 
in the in the uh in the gra
nd...godfather kind of a style...I m
ean there was a whole series 
of retinues, and uh uh my father, although he c
ould have left totall
y poor and destitute uh 
between having no mone y at all and uh and uh 
the fact that there were just too many 
people who we couldn't take with us, my father
 decided to stay.  So that what happened 
in '38.  In '3 9 uh we uh started uh looking at 
the way how to change 
our relationships and 
at that  time my father anticipated that  the 
business would be taken 
away so he started uh 
really working with one of hi
s confidants to divest himself of the business and in that 
respect my father was very forward looking.  
Of course when when 
the extreme measures 
came and particularly the legislation which 
started in, late in 1940 uh which was a very 
elaborate process for uh expropriating the Jews
 before destroying them, uh my father was 
sufficiently skilled to uh to uh divest hims elf 
of t hings before people divested him of it.  
In addition to that his relationships with th
e uh two priests who were prominent including 
the Catholic priest, a ma n by the name  of 
Branecky, who just by coincidence was in the 
same semi nary as Dr. Joseph Tiso, who becam
e the quisling president of Slovakia, uh 
Branecky assured him that whatever  will ha
ppen to Jews, uh Branecky personally protect 

my father because of the services my father
 has rendered to the community, so uh we in 
ma ny respects always anticipated the losses 
that were comi ng and uh we divested of 
property.  We  moved out  of our house.  Uh, we moved uh started moving into less and 

less uh proper quart ers.  We ultimately ended in a shack, sort of in the slums of Tren_ín 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227

but but uh at least the, the fa mily stayed
 together and uh alth
ough the cousins and the 
nieces and the uh in-laws were all deported in
 '42.  My father couldn't protect them 
anymore.  Uh, my father, uh, with the pr
otection of Branecky got a presidential writ 
which protected my father uh from deportation. 
 My father continued working in the store 
which was economically very important for fo
r Slovakia because sti
ll of the distribution 
of oil and fertilizer and fl our, so my father
 continued actually ma na
ging the enterprise.   
 

Q:Can you pause a little bit? 

 

A:Yes. 

 

Q:Uh Paul, tell us what it was like in Tren_í
n from 1940, 1941.  You have described what was 
happening to your fa mily, but I'd like to know 
a little bit more about what was happening 

in the town, what life was like for yo
u as a young ma n during that period. 
 

A: We ll, my life was revolving around uh the 
school and HaShomer HaTzair and uh as 1940 
came to pass, uh there we re restrictions wh
ere you could go for instance.  There were 
certain places where we could not go hikinganymore.  Uh, you couldn't go to movies.  

By 1940 the radios were taken away.  Um... by 1941 you couldn't have a telephone.  Uh 

by uh early 1941 the Jewish school had to collapse
 itself, all of its grades, into a small 
classr oom.  I mean there was continual, almo
st monthly, new regula
tion and proscriptions 
and prescriptions of what you could or coul
dn't do.  Uh by 1941 you had to wear a yellow 
star, and that meant that when you walked 
down the street uh when the local ruffians 
wanted to beat you up, uh they just beat you up. 
 Of course that led 
to the fact that we 
always went together as crowd.  I me an th
ere were no rough tactics 
like using knives or 
anything like that...it was ju
st uh sticks and fists.  So, you know, 1940, 1941 uh was 
conversion of HaShome r  HaTzair into so
rt of a youth gang.  Uh from a c hildhood 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
6 
 
standpoint actually, uh it was a w
onderful experience.  It sort 
of ma de things very intense 
and very important , and suddenly things b
ecame just very very ... things which you 
would not have believed were important became very important.  For instance uh most of 
the Jews had to get rid of their books.  You 
were not allowed to have books.  I mean 
there's lots of things...you couldn't have this, 
this and that, so the notion that you could 
read a book, or that somebody owned a book, was 
a matter of great im
portance because if 
you could borrow a book uh and you had a book or you had access to some body who 

borrowed your book, that was subject of very 
very much conversation--who reads what.  
It became  a very intense kind of a life...uh lif
e became very precious.  Uh so so I'm not 
looking at that period in fact 
uh with with dismay.  It beca
me  a very very intensive life 
where every mo me nt ma ttered and everyt
hi ng mattered, and you became very cautious 
and very very forward looking, very calcula
ting, and very well organized, so....  Of 
course by the end of 1940 or early in 1941, the 
Jewish school was dissolved.  Uh, it just 
happened that my father arranged for some  pe
ople, and and there were some  refugees, to 
to start tutoring me  at home; so starting in 
1941, I had private tutors including some  very 
distinguished uh people who othe
rwise would have, I would ne
ver have met in terms  of 
education.  Uh I started studying English in 19
41.  I had an excelle
nt uh English teacher 
from Vienna.  I didn't have a piano.  We we re not allowed to have a piano, but uh the 

local music teacher who was the wife of a local
 judge let me  practice on her piano.  It it's 
that sort of experiences ... they are they ar
e sort of savoring life and savoring experiences.  

Uh, you know, sure I got beaten up, but we also 
beat up some  of them too, I mean, so uh 
we learned how to do dirty fighting and kicking. 
 Uh we did not always run.  Most of the 
time we did.  Uh and the relationship between the the the young people, I mean the 

people with whom I was  in those days uh...I me a n and and one of them i s in Sweden, one 

of them is in Israel, one of them is in Prague, and they'r e all over the world.  I can pick up 

the phone and talk to them lik
e I can talk to nobody.  Uh, a fe w months ago one of these 
boys who was with me  uh wrote me  a letter and 
in the letter he just me ntioned that he has 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
7 
 
tremendous headaches and uh that uh the docto
rs in Slovakia can't  find out what's  wrong 
with him, so I get the letter
 uh in the morning, I call up uh 
the other boy who was part of 
the group in Göteborg, Sweden, and I said, 
uh, −a no has headaches.  If I send him by 
airplane tomorrow morning to Göteborg can you 
take care...can you take him to a doctor.  
He said of course.  You know, it's like, you know, you know, like like continuing the 
same  conversation of fifty years ago.  I pick
 up the phone.  I call −a
no in Europe, I said 
there is a ticket waiting for you.  Uh you just 
walk down the street and the travel agency 
and hop on the plane and Francl will pick you up 
at the airport.  Now he hasn't  seen 
Francl in fifty years, but, you know, it was just...
it's  that kind of a relationship.  I, I don't  

have with nobody...I, I wouldn't pick up a phone
 like that with anybody else except my 
nearest fami ly or my children, so you know, 
comi ng back to the forties and you want to 
get the spirit...it's, it's life of
 great intensity.  It's life of
 great, uh, changing of outlook.  
Things become  very precious, very important. 
 

Q:And uh the noose then begins 
to tighten.  Wha t  happens.... 
 

A:And as the noose become s tightened, of c
ourse, then uh, you know, when the deportations 
start and this this is very
 ugly, uh but it's very bureaucra
tized.  You know, the lists are 
ma de up, and, and, and in fact the the Jewish
 council admi nisters the list, so the the 
Gestapo has just a few people.  Then they ha
ve the Hlinka Guards, 
the quislings, and then 
you have the local gendarmes, and the whole thing is organized as a ma chine, and the 

machine uh because of its bureaucratic approach, become s predictable which means that 

if you're skillful and if you have pull, uh 
you can anticipate the motions and then you can 

almost figure out the odds of survival and so
 life become s on the part of my father very 
much preoccupied with understanding whic
h way the laws are going and what do you 
give up in order to protect, so in 1942 when
 the uh deportations begin, my father is uh 
advised that, "Yes, we can protect you but 
if you would get baptized uh it would look 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
8 
 
better because it would allow 
us to reclassify you from column 4BC to column 4DA 
which is a different priority."  See, by 
that time uh the whole que
stion of destruction 
become s an arithmetic calculation.  Who owes
 what favor to whom, what can you do to 
protect.  And by the way, that is the sort of
 me ntality that continues afterwards under the 
communist regime.  It it is not ju
st a Holocaust experience.  It 
is a totalitarian experience.  
It's a Kafka's, Kafka-like experience, except it's accentuated because now the game  
become s deadly, so my father said fine.  OK.
  You know, you want to reclassify.  Fine.  
We get baptized.  I just got bar mitzvah in January '42, so then Father come s back and 

said you know, and we have to get baptize
d.  Fi ne Dad.  You know
, how do we do that?   
Well, you know, uh we have to sort of get th
e thing organized and you have to qualify.  
We cannot get you into the Catholic Church
 because it takes too long and it requires 
Archbishop dispensation and it would take a co
uple of years, but uh you can get baptized 
in the Evange lic Church, which was a Protestant
 church.  Uh and the 
Protestant s are more 
flexible because of the heritage and we can
 do the whole thing in 
eight months and you 
have to go to school and learn the catechism a
nd so forth, so part of
 the experience is one 
of how to survive in a totalitarian environmen
t, how to adapt, how to change your skins, 
your habits, your behavior, because that
 is what the rules require.   
 

Q:How did you go about it?  How did this pro
cess of becomi ng   ____ educated to become  
baptized, how did it... 
 

A:Oh there is a procedure for that. 

 

Q:I know.  But how did...yes, I understand that.  
What I want to know is what did Paul 
Strassman do? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
9 
 
A:Oh, I, I, I'm, I'm a I'm a very skillful, hi
ghly disciplined young ma n wh
o can concentrate, and 
if you have to learn the catechism and you 
have to learn the New Testament, uh, you 
know, it's it's a drill like learning anything else
, so you know, if you have to learn things 
in order to get...you have to lear
n the tfillin to get 
bar bar mitzvah and read the Tanach to 
be bar mitzvah, well fine.  They want me  to do 
some thing else, I can do that too.  It's, it's, 
uh, it's an adaptability, so if they want, you know...now they want me  t o jump through 
this loop, I'll go through this loop.  If they 
want me  to jump t hrough this hoop, it that, it 
the price of survival and you know the calculation of this thing...you know 

classifica...reclassification from
 4AB to 4DE means that you 
have another year to go.  
OK.  And if that's  what it takes, that's  wh
at you do.  So it is the me ntal process that I'm 
trying to convey to you is that the genocide is 
a bureaucratic process 
with stipulated rules 
which all have escape clauses and that isnot just genocide although it's, again let me  

emphasize, genocide is deadly.  But it is 
a process which is almost banal in its 
bureaucr atic predictability and manipulability
 and those who survive ar e the indivi duals 
who either have the power or the mo ney 
and the know-how, but you have to have all 
three in order to be able to deal with that
 system.  Now uh there are pl aces where there is 
no escape clauses.  Whe n you're dealing with 
the Gestapo there is no escape clauses.  
Although even there there are es
cape clauses of sorts.  Uh 
of course they are at a 

completely different level, but under the Sl
ovak Republic which basi
cally was a corrupt 
republic, um and uh a republic that always 
wanted to have an alibi for certain 
people...you know, there was...you always built 
an alibi for the next thing and if 
some body's powerful and is protected by Bran
ecky, well he must be important.  If you 
want to preserve your options in the Sl
ovak Republic you can navigate through that uh 
that uh environment and and if you know how to 
do it, you can survive a 
little longer than 
some body else who does not know.  The Jews w
ho are deported in '42 are the powerless, 
the uh...they are the true victims.  They are 
the ones who are not going to fit into the 
society very well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
10 
 
 
Q:Did you see those deportations? 

 

A:Oh yes.  You know, the the lists were drawn up.... 

 

Q:I'd like you to describe one 
deportation that you saw for us. 
 

A: We ll, you you, there is a list that is drawn up a
nd you know the night before from the friendly 
local gendarmes who is on the list.  OK?   
Uh some  people don't know that.  Some  pe ople 
who are on the list don't find out, but if you are connected, you find out.  There's always 

the last mo me nts scurrying around, you know...can 
I get off the list?   In '42 there's still 
the presumption, well we are just going fr
om a very bad situation to just a worse 
situation. We are going to a work camp.  
The whole question of gas chambers and so 
forth is is absolutely not known in '4 2.  Uh 
all the subsequent evid
ence shows that that uh 
that that some  of the evidence 
is comi ng in at late '42, early 
'43 and that is being hidden, 
but in '42 the idea of deportation is just we'r
e going to the next leve
l of negotiation.  OK.  
Now we 'r e going to be entren...no, we  already 
gave up, we already went through twelve 
circles of hell.  OK.  And so well, there's just
 another circle of hell.  OK, well what else 

can they do?  OK.  Uh of course the the war doesn't  look very good in '42, so uh the 

whole notion of going into any sort of resi
stance is totally utopian except under very 
extreme conditions.  Uh there is already 
the first group of Jews who go into the uh 
mountains with arms in '42. 
 

Q:Are you...were you and your fa
ther aware of that? 
 

A:I wasn't , but my father was.  And my father, considering the military situation and the fact that 
the front was, you know, a thousand, two hundred
 kilome ters away and there was nothing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
11 
 
on the west, my father's military assessment was, you know, this is an option that uh that 
is a, you know, this is the twelve... twentieth le
vel of hell.  OK.  But the survivability of a 
fa mily uh, you know...and at that time I 'm thirteen years old and I have a 

sister...survivability in the mountain.  I m
ean, you have to get 
to other levels of 
degradation before you take that option, although
 starting in '42 my father starts doing 
some thing very interesting.  Uh
 my father...and it has some
thing to do with the squalid 
circumstances under which we live, although my
 mother ma de it, you know...it was quite 
presentable.  I mean I I didn't suffer.  We ate, you know, and the fa mily life was very 

close.  Uh, certain things were in short supply, 
so what?   But uh my fath
er starts taking us 
out...there were certain areas 
which, where we were permitted to go for hikes, certain 

areas.  These were some times arbitrary rest rictio
ns.  In other words, ma ny of the laws as 
they came in...there was this bureaucratic fa
ctory churning out new 
restrictive laws.   
They would...say..."Wha t  else can we  do to these people?"  You know, "What next 

tightening of the screw can we do to ma ke the m mi serable? "  But there wa s a whole 

region, a whole area where, which was really 
away from the provincial town which was 
open, and so starting in '42, certainly in '43, my
 father takes us out for hikes, very long 

two-day hikes, and we spent lots of time  in
 the mountains.  My father alwa ys liked the 
outdoors, but it also means we get away from 
the oppressive environment.  When you get 
get out to the uh small peasant villages out 
there the the, you know, it's different.  The, 
the antisemitism is urban.  It's connected w
ith Jewish concentration where they have 
Jewish me rchants and so forth.  In the villages
 you don't have that.  In addition to that, in 
these various villages we re all 
of my  father's little friends, so
 we could always stop in an 
inn which was owned by a guy who most likely ow
ed his life to my father, and certainly 
owed his livelihood to my father, and this 
was...my father was the kapo and these these 
were the soldiers out there, so we go out to 
these villages and um clearly my father had 
this, you know, going out in the woods and 
surviving option on his mi nd because it was 
quite clear that if the Germans lose the wa
r, and it was questionable in '42, uh, the front 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
12 
 
will come over and then the question is what
 do you do in the transi tion.  You clearly 
have to get out of the urban environment where the fi ghting will take place.  So we get 
baptized in '42.  I get bar mitzvah January 24, 
1942, I get baptized in October.  I'm very 
good at that by the way.  I mean I me an the, the, the, uh, I me an this was very 

professionally done.  I mean this was a proper baptism and the catechism and the whole 

thing and I'm very good at that.  It turns that
 theologically the Lutheran religion appeals 
to me more than the Jewish religion because 
the Je wish religion is so obscure and so full 
of, you know, archaic rituals and the Lutheran
 Church in, uh, in, uh, in Slovakia in in 
1940's was very modern, forward looking, highly 
educated church and that particular 
church was a very small mi nority so when the 
Lutherans are a mi nority they are very nice 
people.  Because, you know, they live in 
this Catholic sea and uh, you know, then you 
suddenly can go to church, any church.  Th
ey play Bach, and suddenly you can go to 
church on Sunday and it's perfectly legitima te.  You're expected to.  You know, you're 

baptized and the people are very nice.  
Lutherans say, well, you know, it's it jolly, you 
know, you know.  You know, we got some  Jews
 you know.  Jesus Christ was a Jew and 
the Old Testament we read once in a while, you 
know.  The more the me rrier, and besides 
Mr. Zema n who was the other priest who uh, uh, lik
ed my father very well and they we re 
quite close...they were really friends, you know
, always saw to it that on the way out of 
the church he stopped and talked to my father
 and talked to me  and so forth.  And old 
Zema n really liked me  because, you know, I knew the catechi sm as as good as any, you 

know...he used...once, once Zema n said a terrible
 thing which my father sort of laughed 
about.  Uh Zema n was teaching some  kind of
 a theological discussion to a class, a 
Sunday class, and this kid just didn't  know
 the answers, so Zema n say, " Well why don't 
you go and talk to Strassma n.  He 'll explain it 
to you," and so the kid say, "Well, that's  
easy.  He's  a Jew.  He knows it."  (Laughter)  You know, it was a reference to the Old 

Testament.  My fath...father delighted in st
ories like that.  So by end of '4 2, out of 
fourteen hundred Jews, uh we are down to a
bout a hundred and fifty Je
ws in Tren_ín, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
13 
 
the deportations come  in.  They are schedule
d.  There is this scurrying.  Uh in the 
morning the local gendarme knocks a t  your 
door.  The train is 
on a siding already 
scheduled.  The whole thing is scheduled.  The 
train is, it's usually 
uh a freight train but 
someti mes it's a passenger train, and uh and the gendarme comes and he gives you a 
piece of pape r you have to sign.  Uh early they 
uh in the first set of deportations uh they 
actually come  for the young people first because 
they go through the pretense that this is 
a labor camp, so let's take the young people.  
So the parents have to sign a receipt for 
their son and then they have to
 si gn that they receive a receip
t.  Procedure calls for that.  
And so the thing is just denuded, and of
 course everybody is trying to scurry.  
Everybody's trying to look for exemption but 
but...and everybody knows 
that there is a 
certain number of Jews who are not goi
ng to get to report although nobody knows how 
ma ny.  This is always kept open.  And then 
there is a list and 
there are grades of 
protection.  There is so-called 
a presidential exemption, and 
there is economic essential 
uh exemption.  Then there is an exemptionfor people who were governme nt employees.  

In in other words there's grades of exemp
tion.  Uh everybody spends a great deal of time 
trying to figure out what level of exempti
on they have.  The train takes them...and people 
just go fairly uh fairly ... you know, you go and take
 a train.  Uh there are rules.  You can 

take only twenty kilos per person.  Uh there'
s a big discussion ...well, what do you take?   
You know, do you take pots and pans, or don't you 
take pots and pans.  Uh there is big 
discussion to the Judensrat, you know...uh give us 
a list of what to take.  Do we take pots 
and pans?   OK.  And and those kind of 
questions.  And the whole thing become s 
involved in the mi nutia.  The tragedies are not 
visible.  There is not
 weeping or tearing.  
There is very little force.  It is...you see 
you have now you have been through two years 
of being degraded more and more, s o this is
 just another level of degradation, and by the 
way, you are going to _ilina, which is a transh
ipme nt ca mp.  OK.  A staging camp.  And 
there are people who are able to
 get exemptions out of _ilina.  In other words, you are 
shipped to _ilina but that's not the final because you could still then pr otest and if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
14 
 
meet certain requirements you get an exempti
on to be pulled out of _ilina, so so the 
energies are invested in trying 
to escape, and that fits very
 well with the mentality of 
survival which is centuries and centuries
 old and that the Jews survive by bending, 
accommodat i ng and negotiating.   
 
Q:How did your father survive? 

 

A:My father just, uh, uh...first, he had money 
and he...all of that was gone by '42.  He  had 
friends.  He had influence, and he was very 
important.  He was a very skillful ma n, and 
uh and he ran the biggest food business a
nd oil business and petroleum business and 
fertilizer business, and all the stores 
were dependent, on him and there was enough 
people who said, you know, this guy is...and then he got the presidential exemption 

through Branecky, which was the highest level,
 so the word...we
ll, you know, if any...you 
know, the last guy out out of Tren_ín will be Strassman.  The question was could he 

protect fami ly.  You see, very often the ex
emption stopped at the family head, and the 
children had to go.  And that's why we baptized
 because the this was there was this quirk 
is that if we baptize and he has number one 
exemption, then the thing falls in a different 

classi fication, so we baptized because  of the children.  It was a terrible thing for my 

mother.  She never got over that.   
 

Q:Your parents were not baptized? 

 

A:Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Both of them.  They had to 
be baptized.  That that wa
s part of the procedure, 
you know.  You go and you look at the proced
ure and you study the procedure and you 

weigh the pros and cons.  It, it creates a 
me ntality which only a communist citizen or  

some body who like Kafka would understand.  It 
is a a twisted way of looking at the 
world.  And the Jewish me ntality, of course, af
ter centuries of experience, was especially 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
15 
 
well attuned to that because you negotia
ted your way out of Spain.  You know, you 
became a Marrano.   You baptized and all...
I me an there's these innum...innumerable kind 
of deals that you can ma ke, or you can reclassify yourself.  Now you're not a Spaniard, 
you're a Portuguese.  You're still in the same  town,  You give up the ma in house and so 

forth. 
 

Q:Did the Strassman fa mily live secretly as a Jew,
 as Jews while they were...after they had been 
baptized?  
 

A:Turned out that my mother lived as a Je
w, although there was no was no schul.  There was 
nothing.  There was no mi nyan.  I mean the sy
nagogue was closed.  My
 wife...my mother 
was a Jew.  I mean that she always was, but
 I enjoyed the the chur
ch.  I mean I could go 
and hear Bach for the first time.  They let me  play on the organ and and and, uh, the 

people were very nice, and the Luth
erans also were part of Sokol [
NB:
 translation, 
"Falcon"].  I don't know whether you know what 
it...it was a Turnverein.  It's a gymna stic 
club, OK?   And, uh, you know, you couldn't do othe
r things so and I mean I couldn't go 
to the movie.  I couldn't listen to this.  I c
ouldn't listen to that, but
 apparently there was a 
loophole and nobody figured that a Jew woul
d become  a me mber of a Lutheran 
gymnastic club. 
 

Q: What was that like for you? 

 

A:Fine.  You know, I, I, I, you know, I, I accommoda
ted.  Didn't wear a star 
after the presidential 
exemption. Some body who had a presidential ex
emption, he and his family did not have 
to wear a star. OK.  And um, you know, ev
erybody knew that I was a Jew.  Uh, as a 
matter of fact, after the major 
deportation uh I think the bullies 
laid off me .  I mean they 
just...the bullies didn't go after me  any more. 
 I mean most of my HaShomer HaTzair 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
16 
 
group was gone, uh with the excep
tion of two and uh there was 
just not ma ny things to 
pick on.  Now I got beaten up ma ybe  once or twice a year, but that's  all.  I me an it was 
not just continual harassme nt.  
It was the, the, the yellow st ar that gave free license to the 
bullies to beat up everybody.  Once you didn't have
 a yellow star...well, it confused them.  
I mean it's, it's a, it's a very funny totalitari
an society, is a veryfunny kind of society. You 
know, in ma ny respects it lives
 by some  very rigid rules. 
 

Q: What happened...tell us what 
happened next.  I'm  sorry. 
 

A: We ll, this is '42.  The deportations take place 
and now there is hundred and fifty Jews left in 
Tren_ín.  The Jews are living very low 
key, don't  go out on the square.  You know, you 
want to be as un...invisible as possible.  Myfather gets up early in the mo rning and he 

goes to the store.  He's  not in the front office.
  I mean it's his own store, but he's in the 
back office, you know, doing the paper work a
nd the ordering and and the scheduling of 
things and who gets what, because you know, there's rationing and it become s very 

complicated.  Uh, uh, I go to the appointed tu
tors.  I go to the gym.  Uh, I go to the 
church on Sunday, which is enjoyable.  My sister
 finds a job as a clerk.  My mother is at 
home .  The grandparents, one set of gra
ndparents is protected...my father's...my 

grandfather from the father's side is protec
ted because of my father's exemption.  Those 
are the only part of the fa mily that can be prot
ect...they don't go out at all.  They just stay 
in this one room hovel, and I bring them 
food.  They don't go out shopping.  I mean they 
they are just invisible.  And so starting 
in '42 except for the long hikes we take on 
weekends, we are invisible.  It's a total sh
rinking in, and trying to listen to Radio London, 
uh, trying to find out what the news is, uh, 
having a ma p which you open every night and 
you see what happens on the Russian front a
nd reading the newspapers to try to guess 
what really happened.  Uh, it's, it's a ve
ry...you know, you live in a two room apartment 
which includes a kitchen and uh that goes on. Uh, '43...I me an there is annoyances  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
17 
 
uh but after the ma jor bulk deportations, th
e Slovaks have done, you know, what the the 
uh Nazis wanted and the Slovaks have gotte
n all the properties th
ey wanted.  They 
divested anything, and uh they have Jews in
 Sered and in Nováky ...those are the two two 
rema ining camps uh where they have able-bodi
ed me n ma king furniture for the state, for 
the governme nt, you know uh just being used as 
uh slave labor, but th
ey are surviving.  
Uh my father has access to food, so we send lo
ts of parcels, lots 
of people uh parcels.  
There are some  illegals around, but they get flushed out and that goes on.  That's '43 a nd 

early '44. 
 

Q: What is your fa mily's  relationship now to th
e rest of the Jewish community?   You've been 
baptized. 
 

A:Yeah. 

 

Q: What are relationships like...? 

 

A:No change at all.  I mean everybody...I mean those few people who rema ined...these are 
personal relationships.  I mean that's th
at's uh...Goldner (ph) and Strassman...it has 
nothing...we don't change our name .  Uh I m
ean that is...you know, a rich Strassman now 
lives in a two, two-room hovel but you know, 
that doesn't  change that Strassman is 
Strassman and and he's still Mr. St rassma n.  OK.
  So none of that ch
anges.  There is no 
change.  Uh what you carry with you, unless 
you're totally degraded...uh what happens in 
concentration camp where you're absolutely st
ripped of everything, of dignity, but as 
long as you can keep your dignity, the fact
 that you're poor and you don't having clothing 
and that you have to be careful and so forth, 
doesn't  matter.  Absolutely doesn't  matter.  
You can carry your human dignity whether you'
re in a slum or whether you are in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
18 
 
plush, plush castle, or vice versa.  You 
don't carry it.  So on a huma n level there's 
absolutely no change.  None. 
 

Q:Early '44.  What happens? 

 

A: Early '44 things are starting to 
get interesting.  Of cour
se, the front is starting to roll over.  In 
early '44, uh, there's a huge quisling army in 
the Slovak state.  In fact, there are two 
divisions, each of about fo
rty thousand me n.  Uh, they ge
t rotated in and out of the 

eastern front.  Uh, originally when the 
Germans are winning, the quisling army fights 
with the Nazis, although they'r
e never really given front dut
y.  They do sort of second 
echelon kind of duty.  Uh, as soon as the 
Russians, after Stalingrad and comi ng to 
Kharkov, you suddenly start having defections
 from the Slovak army and you start 
creating a Czechoslovak Ar my in the Soviet 
Union.  Of course th
ere is a Czechoslovak 
army also in, in the west who escaped in '38 
and '39.  Uh, by early '44 the officer corps of 
the, uh, of the, uh, Czechoslovak army in, uh, in the west drops some  offic e rs down, and 

these are the officers with who, with whom th
ey served prior to 1939 and they say look, 
we have to st art getting ourself ready becau
se the Germans are going to lose the war and 

so the officer corps uh decides that we are 
going to, uh, uh, attack the Ge rmans whe n the 
time come s, when the...in order when the Russi
ans come  ove r the Carpathian rather than 
have destructive, hand-to- hand comb at because everybody sees that when the front goes 

this way and that way through the Ukraine, 
there's nothing left...we are going to try to 

attack the Germans from the back. 
 

Q: What happens to you and your family as all this is happening? 

 

A: We  don't  know any of that. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
19 
 
Q: What I need to know... 
 

A: We  we are continue...we continue living, wi
thdrawing more and more, although what loomed 
more and more importantly, and now we go 
out every weekend and now we start going 

out in Februa ry when it's cold and uh we star
t getting shoes, because the idea is that when 
the front will roll over we  will leave wher
e we are and go...disperse the family to the 
various people out there who ar
e our loyalists, and we'll go 
and hide, because starting in 
'44 those Jews who re main, and there is a
bout eight thousand Jews left over in all 
Slovakia, both legally and ill
egally and baptized, non-bapt
ized, out of a population of, 
pre-war population of eighty-five thousand, so 
ten percent is left, which is still a very 
large number, although out of that eight thous
and, a large proporti
on is in camps uh, you 
know, doing slave labor, but they are...they di
d not go to gas chambers.  OK.  I would 
reckon that about two thousand 
out of the eight thousand are 
actually interned in camps, 
working uh at no wages for the Slovak government.  OK.  Six thousand are dispersed for 

one reason or another, including, you know
, uh, uh, wome n, J e wish wome n ma rried to 
Christians and visa versa, mi xed ma rriages 
and all kinds of exemptions and there was 
exemptions for American citizens and there was...I mean there was a whole list of 

exemptions.  OK?  
 

Q:Again, I need to pull you back. 

 

A:And and our fa mily just lived in that envi
ronment and starting in '44, everybody starts saying 
OK, now now uh when the war come s in, how do we survive, because everybody knows 

that uh when the front come s over uh the German
s are going to come  in and then all the 
bets are off.  In other words, all of th
e exemptions under which you live are going to be 
thrown out, because then uh you have a different
 law.  You also must understand that the 

quisling governme nt found it very convenient an
d so did the Germans uh to sort of have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
20 
 
their own order because that gi ves them jobs
, nationalistic and what have you.  And of 
course the Nazis had other fish to fry and as 
long as the quislings c
ontrolled things...OK.  
So you want to keep your eight thousand Jews
 or out of them _____.  I'm going to worry 
about other things, you know, like the Hungari
an Jews and the Roma nian Jews and and 
the destruction of the Jews.  Meanwhile I'm ga
ssing the Jews, so I'm going to get to your 
Jews.  OK.  And there are documents to that e
ffect, and so starting in early '44, the fa mi ly 
starts becomi ng concerned about how to survive 
the transition and this is when these very 
bizarre plots get hatched, and everybody does th
em very secretly on their own.  Uh some  
people are going to go what's called into a 
bunker.  A bunker is some  kind of a dug-out.  
You know, the mountains are strung with cel
lars, root cellars where you keep your 
carrots and your cabbages.  I mean there's no 
refrigerator but you go below the frost line, 
you have sand in there and it's a mound of 
earth, a door.  You creep in and you're going 
to stay there until liberation come s a
nd you...uh the ma n who uh who uh ma rried my 
wife...uh my  my my sister, my si
ster, Ella, my older sister ... 
she's five years older than 
me ...uh hatches this totally unlikely plot that
 he has a friend and this friend is a 
bricklayer.  This bricklayer 
finds in that old house a corri
dor where he's going to ma ke a 
false brick wall and my  brother-in-law, uh 
Gejza uh is going to go and you know, when 
when when the quisling's governme nt goes dow
n and the Nazis come in, they all set it 
out.  They se t out br icks and mortar and all what he will do.  On a night's notice he  will 
able to go to this house, un craw
l in at the end of the corridor
, and this bricklayer is going 
to ma ke a fa lse wall, uh three feet on this side
 and Gejza going to be there, and there are 
going to be three false bricks to bring food 
in once day and take the excrements out and 
he's  going to stay there.  And by the way, 
that's what actually happened.  The guy was 
behind that wall for eleven months.  OK?   And so
 every Jew then tries to concoct this this 
what's  called the transition plot, OK, and so
me  people have better plots.  Some  people 
have bad plots.  Some  pe ople don't have plots.
  Some  people believe in the cellar we can 
muddle through.  Some  people say, "no, nothing 
is going to happen and it's  just going 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
21 
 
to...suddenly we'r e going to be liberated."  It's  called the liberation scenario.  So starting 
in '44, the liberation scenario becomes very im
portant.  At this par
ticulartime my father 
said, "Well we are going to take the option of
 dispersing the fa mily. 
 We 're not going to 
be together.  You're going to go here.  Y
ou're going to go here...we go to here..." and 
these things...these are nego...t
hese deals are negotiated.  So that's what's early '44.  
Meanwhile the plots are being hatched and ther
e is news that uh parachutists are dropping 
uh during the night, and you know, getting ready 
for the transition and so forth, because 
everybody is getting ready for for Germany to 
collapse any mome nt.  Now this is early 
'44, again.  Am I answering your... 
 

Q:You are indeed.  At this point I wa
nt to stop.  Let us change tapes.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

Q:Early '44? 

 

A:Early '44 the quisling army, the two divisions 
that fight for the for the, uh, Slovak quisling 
governme nt, uh, ma kes a deal with the London governme nt [
NB:
 the Czechoslovak 
governme nt in exile] and the idea is that 
when the time come s to, uh, for the Russians to 
cross over the Carpathian mount
ains, uh, that government will
 come  in, the Slovak army 
will attack the Germans in the mountain pa
sses from the rear, hold ground until the army 
can come  over and uh that's how it would be.  
We  will liberate Slovakia.  Uh, the deal is 
ma de, uh, in May, but that's when the ne
ws comes out what happened in Poland.
1
  As you 
know...again it was a we stern inspired, wester
n led uprising that uh 
led to the Russians 
stopping at the Visla [
NB:
 Vistula], and letting the German
s wipe them out.  So another 
meeting takes place and the idea now is to 
ma ke a deal with the communists, who also 
have an army running under the Soviet comman
d from the east, and say we are going to 
ma ke this join and in order to cooperate w
ith the with the uh Soviets we are going to put 
the communists in char ge and so late in Ma
y a meeting is held where the communists are 
going to go Kiev where the hea
dquarters of the uh Russian army is headed by a ma n by 
the name  of Krushchev, Nikita Krushchev [
NB:
 at this time , acting as Commissar of the 
Soviet partisans], and the timing of the Ru
ssian attacking is the mountain pass and the 
communist leadership now of the Slovak 
underground will be coordinated so we don't 
have a situation like in Poland.  Turns out 
the communists don't keep their part of the 
deal. They actually never communic a te with 
the Soviets.  The co
mmunists were totally 
                     
   1
 The  War sa w Revolt be gan 
in ear ly August 1944. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
23 
 
different scenario and in fact 
they want to repeat the same  thing that happened in Poland, 
and so the communists rather than wa it 
for a coordinated army and underground and 
communists and Russian attack across the mount
ains, jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in 
August in large quantity into Slovakia and th
ese saboteurs without any coordination with 
anybody, stopped the night train that goes from Be
rlin to Bucharest.  Just happens on that 
train are twenty-eight German generals.  
Line them up on the railroad station in 
Ru_omberok and shoot them.  The following day uh 
my father says "OK. 
 This is it.  We 
are going to go into our escape 
plan.  We are going to execu
te our escape pl an.  We are 
going to disperse," and so that morning wh
ich is the 28th of uh 27th of August, 1944, uh 
we go and we get dropped off in the various vi
llages and we stay th
er e.  Well it turns out 
that the Germans are a little sl
ow to react.  They take some
 retaliatory action which is 
local but there is no Sonderkomma ndo, not anyt
hing.  And also the uh the base which is 
the business, it still has to be
 run and so after two days in
 our locations, uh my uh my 
father is told uh look, you better come bac
k.  This is...you jumped the gun a little.  
You...it's premature.  So the whole family re
trieves from the  pre-st
aged hiding places and 
we go back where we were.  OK.  Now this is a 
fatal mi stake.  But it leads...it's it's part of 
really not understanding what was really 
going on.  Uh and because of course the 
Russians are not crossing the Carpathians.  Th
e Russians have no intentions of crossing.  
They just start a new offensive in Poland, so 
Slovakia is not even on the ma p of of being 
crossed.  What the Germans meanwhile do is
 they just land Sonderkomma ndos for the 

sole purpose of disarming the Slovak ar
my, the various Slovak, uh, uh, Slovak, uh, 
garrisons.  They successfully disarmed the eastern division, which was the highly arme d, 

which was the spear-head of this whole plot.  
They totally disarmed them and they shoot 
the, uh, the, uh, the key generals who staged
 it...who were going to stage that thing 
because all of this thing is 
leaked out.  The western division, which is about thirty-five 
thousand me n, um, just escape the garrisons be
fore the Germans can get there to disarm 
them.  The, the soldiers mutiny and just take  to the mountains, and that happens late on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
24 
 
the 29th of August.  At this particular point
, the Germans come over and then the fighting 
starts between the the, uh, Sl
ovak soldiers of the western di
vision and the Germans.  Uh, 
on the night of the 29th of August, uh, fo
r reasons which I still don't understand, my 
father decided, "Why don't you sleep home  
tonight and just why, why don't you go and 
sleep some where else so that the whole family's not together," although we are still in 
Tren_ín.  And I go to sleep at a house of a 
friend, uh, who was half-Jewish and they were 
workers and, and, and some how...nobody every paid attention to them.  I just slept there.  

Early in the morning I get the me ssage dur
ing the night the Gest
apo came  and took 
twelve hostages, and my father was one of th
e hostages.  They were...he was not taken as 
a Jew.  He was taken as the head operator.  
Subsequently in '45, I find out that my father 
was involved in shippi ng food, uh, into illegal 
food caches that were being already staged 
starting in May, so that when the army star
ts holding against the 
Germans there is food 
already in the mountains being staged for th
e for the uh for the soldiers.  So in the 
morning uh my father gets taken away.  They were looking for me .  All the ma les were 

going to be taken.  I wasn't  there.  They ju
st came  in...they came  in during the night.  

Again this wa s totally irregular.  When
ever Jews were taken, you know, the local 
gendarmerie came with the bureaucratic pr ocedur e, and there was a time to be warned.  

The Germans...there was no warning.  They
 just took, uh, uh, some  some  people who are 

involved, uh, in in the upri
sing.  They were taken as 
hostages, and so now, uh, the 
me ssage come s for my mother.  You know, I ne
ver see my mother again.  Uh, we cannot 
go back to where we were before.  We blew our
 cover.  We  go to a fallback position.  In 
other words, there were two layers of places to
 go to and so I leave the house where I was 
sleeping, with this friend, and go to an empl
oyee of my father w
ho was in one of the 
villages outsi de of of of Tr
en_ín.  My sister goes to another pl ace.  My mother goes to 
another place.  So the family gets dispersed.  We  go into what's called bunker mode, 

which is you go some where and you're going to
 be hidden some where in a closet or 
something until the war blows over, but my fath
er isn't there anymore.  OK.  My father 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227

gets taken.  Uh he gets tort
ured and he gets shipped to 
Sachsenhausen where he's  killed, 
but he gets shipped with the uh uprising.  Uh
 there's a whole group of
 people involved in 
the uprising who who ge ts uh w
ho gets annihilated in Sachse
nhausen.  So I go over to the 
house of this this fallback, second position 
uh backup.  And I'm there one night.  In the 
morning the wife of this employee come s 
in all panicky.  This employee had a young 
wife, recently ma rried.  He was a much olde
r ma n.  This was his second marriage.  The 
girl was sort of a floozy or 
whatever and uh she come s in a
ll alarme d.  She's a new wife, 
and says, "Look...the Germans are doing house to house search," and by that time  the 
Germans announced that "If we find any uh partisan
s, soldiers or Jews uh we are going to 
shoot them and also shoot every inhabitant in
 the house."  So the wife gets very alarme d 
and this newly ma rried older guy goes to me  and says, "Look, why don't you just go away 

for the day out to the to the to the rive
r where there are thru
shes and bushes...you know, 
it's it's fairly wooded and near the river." 
 Throughout the valley flows a river by the 
name  of Vá h and there are all kinds of hi
ding places.  "Why don't you stay there?  And uh 

then come  back in the evening and we'll 
see how things go."   Now re me mber...I'm 
fifteen years old, so I...and oh...and I get a sandwich.  OK.  I go in my sa ndals, in my 

short shoes, a shirt a belt a
nd a sandwich, for the day at the river.  Now you also must 
understand that through all of this time  
I know t he area extremely well, and I'm a 
fabulous swimmer because we swim quite a bit in th
e river.  It's a wild river.  It has it ha s 
it has uh rapids too, and we swi m through th
e rapids and so forth, but you know...and it's 
it's part of the training and oh...we swim through the river because we couldn't go to the 

only swimming pool there was in Tren_ín.  Si
nce 1940 Jews are not allowe d to go to the 
swimming pool so you learn how to swim throug
h the river, which is dangerous and full 
of rapids, but it's fun.  I told you, you know, hard
ship creates fun too.  
So I go to the river 
and I sit there and during the day I see on th
e bridge the German tanks comi ng in and 
motorcycles and the Germans are really moving in.  Now the Germans are comi ng in full 

force.  The army has basically abandoned 
the garrison.  There is a huge garrison in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
26 
 
Tren_ín.  Tren_ín is a is a regi
me nt headquarters.  It's it's 
a strategic town.  Always has 
been.  It is...by the way, it is a strategic to
wn since Roma n times, so it's one of the old, 
old Roma n camps.  It's it's a throttle of th
e of the valley, and there I see the Germans 
going up and down.  By about three o'clock in th
e afternoon I hear lots of shooting out in 
the mountains, which is in the di rection which I knew very well which we...because we 
hiked there.  And by four o'clock in the af
ternoon I decided I'm not going to go back to 
the house of this employee where his wife is not
 sure that really she she likes me  and and 
so forth.  It it's  purely an 
instinct.  It's it's...I don't know
...you you learn it as an animal.  
There are certain survival uh instincts that you 
have and I say I will not be able to last  
there a couple of months .  I mean you 
are fifteen years old but you can...you know now 
how to ma ke calculations.  And I say well, th
ey are shooting so that means that that's  
good news, because you know, if they'r e shootin
g there that means that there are some 
friends out there.  So about four o'clock in 
the afternoon I uh take o
ff my shirt,takethe 
sandals, tie them up on my head with my belt,
 and I go into the river and I swim down the 
river, under the bridges where the Nazis 
go up and down, and I swim for about five 
kilome ters, totally out of range of the town, get out, know the area extremely well...we 

hiked there.  It's  a very pi
cturesque area.  It's it's it's a it's a valley surrounded by 
mountains on both sides, highly wooded, and I st
art marching late in
 the evening through 
the fields and and if you know 
that area these are small land-
holdings and there are little 
paths, there are just  millions 
of little paths between each property.  This...these are not big 
fields and and there are there ar
e tree lines and there are bushe s so there is always a pl ace 

to hide and I walk in my shorts in this thi
ng and and again my  not being sort of alienated, 
not being an urban Jew, I just walked th
rough the fields and the, you know, the the 
peasants see me .  You know, you say uh th
e right thing...you...there
 is, there is a 
way...you know, bless the God and you know, the 
answer...bless the 
Mary and you know 
you...there there are greetings because the peasan
ts are really very religious.  These are 
small semi -feudal kind of enclaves, uh but 
you can walk free right though those enclaves 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
27 
 
and I get up to the mountain line.  There is lo
ts of shooting going on there, and I run into 
a bunch of soldiers.  These are who from the 
Tren_ín garrison, and th
ey are resting there 
with a machine gun and and rifles and wh
at have you, and uh I say, "You know, I would 
like to join you."  So the se
rgeant says, "You are a Jew aren't
 you?"  "Yah, I am a Jew."  
He says, "Well, we...you know, you are just 
a kid.  We  don't ...we are out for serious 
business on the...we are going to be fi ghti
ng the Germans.  Uh we can't  have 
some body...you have never shot a rifl e.  We  
don't  need you."  I said, you know, "But 

look, I I really need help."  So they said, "L
ook, kid.  Here is a hand grenade.  We 'll give 
you a hand grenade but just go away."  So
 I say, "Well, what do you do with a hand 
grenade?"  So the guy shows me  how to unlat
ch a hand grenade, close the hand grenade, 
and puts me  away.  So I wander through the 
mountain (cough) for about a day with a 
hand grenade.  I stop at...there 
is a hunting lodge up there and 
I go to the uh keeper of the 
hunting lodge and I said, you know, I would like so
me  food.  He gives me  plenty of food.  
Of course, I carry the hand grenade.  I'm 
quickly learning the trick how you get food.  
And so I wander around and then on the 
second or third day...I don't know which 
anymore...and of course I sleep out in the woods.  I know how to do that.  Although I've 

no clothing, there is a way of ta
king pine branches and sleepin
g out there.  You you really 
can do that.  I mean if if you...it's not that diffi
cult.  And there are lots of hay rakes, all 
over the place, in the mountains, so you can al
wa ys take some  straw out of a hay rake, 
ma ke a bedding out of uh pine and then put
 straw on it and then cover yourself with 
straw...you can be very comfortable, and if 
it rains you go into a hay rake.  There's all 
kinds of shooting going on all over the place, but 
it's very spotty.  On this morning of the 
third day I suddenly see a tall figure comi
ng up the path with obviously a heavy gun or 
some thing and I hide behind a tree, unlatch
 my hand grenade and when the guy passes 
me  I just stick my hand with the hand gren
ade behind his back and said, "Give me  your 
gun."  The guy turns around and it is a officer w
ho is in civilian clothing who is taking a 
heavy machine gun over.  He's going to join th
e partisans.  He's  looking for the partisans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
28 
 
the way I am looking for them.  So he sa
id, "Kid, do you know what you're doing?   I 
mean are sure you know how to put the pin 
back?"  So uh, you know, 
after he identifies 
himself I finally put the pin back and say, "Well, you and I are going to go and look for 
the partisans together," so we walk for about
 a half a day, and then we come  in at the 
bottom of the mountain range and there we see 
at the...from the edge of the forest on the 
road a bunch of guys... obviously not soldiers, funny looking guys, running around and 

there is a truck there, and 
so uh Kartal, the the officer, said, "You know, I'm going to 

cover you with the machine.  Why don't you 
go down there and find out
 what those guys 
are...are they our side or what are they." 
 See meanwhile of course the guards and the 
quislings also had uh civil guard
s and battalions and all kinds of
 ar ms things...I me an this 
was all mi shed, me ssed up, so I put my hand gr
enade and walked down, and there is this 
funny looking little squat guy and, 
uh, his only right hand and his 
left hand is chopped off 
and, uh, he carries Soviet stars on his on his ep
aulets.  And, uh, it turns out to be one of 
these special commando groups that were dr
opped by the Soviets two weeks before, and 
these are really professi onal ki
llers.  These are real guerrillas.
  This is...these are people 
who have been through the Ukraine in a guerril
la warfare for two, th
ree years, and they 
are collecting appare
ntly squat.  They just came  from
 scouting around looking for the rail 
line and when they came, the rail line was t
oo far away so I...they start imme diately 
quizzing me and I say, well, I have a partner 
up there.  They see a heavy machine gun.  
They say, "Well, we like you guys," so they i
mmediately take the o
fficer with the heavy 
machine gun.  They need a heavy machine gun.  Uh, they they say, "Well, what do we do 

with you kid?"  And I say, "Well, you know, I re
ally know this area very well," so the uh 
the Russian who's...you know, "you can really unde
rstand Russian reasonable well."  This 
was the Ukrainian uh said, "you know, we 
really could use some body who knows the 
local area to walk ahead of 
us and, you know, we'll dress you up in some ragged peasant 
stuff and you will just ...we'll we 'll use you as a 
as a guide to walk ahead of us, and if you 
want to keep the hand grenade you can keep
 the hand grenade as long as you don't show 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
29 
 
it, and then you can alwa ys blow yourself up if 
they catch you."  (Laughter)  So, so, uh, I, 
I think this is a great...I thi
nk...I thought this was a fantasti
c deal, and so uh they logged 
me  in and they signed me  up right away, you know...we are put you in and uh then let's 
hop in the hop in the truck.  We mount the m
achine gun on top of the truck in case we run 
into Germans or Gardists...these were called lik
e guardists, like they were called "Garda."  
We go in into a village where apparently ther
e is a base being ma de
 and there is...it's full 
of soldiers and there's arms all over the pl
ace and there's dynamite all over the place.  I 
mean there was just just all the arms you 
wanted to see because the soldiers...this 
was...they vacated the garrisons, took all the ar
ms  and they all and all all the ammo wi th 
them and I say well could I at least have 
a rifle, so we go this through this long 
negotiation.  OK.  You c a n have a rifle.  
And uh I sleep, get fed pork.  I really feel 
fantastic.  I mean...I 'm, I 'm really...I mean 
this is a bunch of he-men.  I'm clearly the 

youngest guy.  Uh early in th
e afternoon some body says well, do you know how to shoot.  
I say I don't even know how to load the thing, so
 they take me  out and they say this is 
what you do and they show me  
how to how to shoot.  In th
e morning uh this, this, this 
Russian come s.  His name  is "Batko"
 ...everybody's only known by their first 
name ...come s and say, "Well, we'r e going to go fo
r a raid.  Uh we really have to find a 
rail line that  is close to the forest so we 
can really get ourselves 
lined up in here.  Uh 
we'r e taking you with us kid."  So I g
o...but no rifl e...peasant clothing, just the hand 
grenade in your pocket, so I go 
on the fi rst raid.  Now turns out that  this was the luckiest 
thing that ever happened to me, because the army that fled and the communist 

governme nt that got created, created actually an 
area, a liberated area.  They declared it a 
Czechoslovak-liberated state.
  It was a hundred by two hundred kilome ters.  They 
decided to hold it until the Russians come. 
 Now this was in Se ptember.  This was 
another Wa rsaw Uprising, only on a much bigger scale and uh "Batko"'s orders was 

never stay in villages.  Ne ver st
ay put.  Your job is not to fight Germans.  Your job is to 
me ss railroad, rail lines up.  Now I didn't know 
that.  Now one of the grave mi sfortunes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
30 
 
of the other Jews were that they came in...t
his was a liberated area.  They joined the 
established environment.  Many of the Jews 
who had fled to that area, and of course 
when the Germans cleaned it up by October 28t
h, everybody got annihilated and there are 
these hugh tank ditches that people dug wh
ich are full of bodies.  You know, about 
eighty-five thousand people got killed in that 
that process.  So we go on the first raid I 
think on the 4th of September, 
and uh I like it.  I mean it is 
just great.  You know, here 
are the guys.  You know, there's eight of us, 
a machine gun, uh lots of ammo.  Uh there 
are guys who are carrying the TN
T...that's what we used, uh TNT.  It's it's it's more 
powerful than than than dynamite but it's not 
like plastique, and these are little uh me tal 
boxes about this big, this wide and uh it's 
a real charmi ng group.  Uh a commando squad 
is a very unusual dynami cs.  In other words, in no time everybody knows he is dependent 
on everybody, so I mean nobody says "I'm a Jew," 
or anything like that.  I me an it's just, 

you know, "Hey, kid.  You know, you going to walk ahead of us, you know.  We  we 

really need you."  And so I lead them th
rough the mountains and uh we go further north 
of Tren_ín.  See, below Tren_ín the valley wi
dens and the railroad track hugs the river so 
it's about two, three kilometers away from 
the mountains.  Once you go north of Tren_ín, 
you are in a narrow valley and th
e railroad tracks sort of snak
es in and out and there are 
dozens of places where you can come fairly close 
to the railroad without being seen.  So I 
take them there.  They are very pleased uh 
with with that, and uh so we ma rch during the 
day, ducking the villages.  Of course the 
peasants see us, but everybody turns around.  
You know, they don't wa nt to see us and uh we
 go...starts raining.  We  come  to the edge, 
edge of the forest early in the evening and we
 are just going to sit there and wait.  I I'm 
not sure I know what's  going on, but "Batko"
 obviously knows.  He must have done it 
dozens and dozens of time s.  He sets up the 
machine gun so that if if uh the troops would 
come  against us...the idea is to have a high 
ground.  The railroad is down, and we find, as 
I will show you later on a photograph, it's an em
bankment.  We sit at the edge of the 
forest.  There is an embankme nt below us where we sit will sit up the ma chine gun and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
31 
 
then uh then a few of us will go to the track. 
 Uh as soon as it gets dark uh "Batko" uh 
says "OK, let's go to the track.  And why don'
t you come  with us."  So three of us go 
down to the track.  Why he took me , I don't know
.  We  go to the track.  We lay the TNTs 
right on to the rail.  And the the the trick 
is in demolition...this is not what you see in 
movies, John Wa yne mo vies...t
here is no way how you can carry enough ammo to blow 
up a train sky high.  To blow up a train sky hi
gh you would have to be on a bridge.  You 
would have to know exactly where the bridge 
pins are.  The bridges were usually in 
populated areas.  There was no way; and they
 were guarded and it was too risky.  The 
real trick is to get the trai
n derail itself.  The way how you do it is you find a place where 
the track is slightly on a curve.   The way a trai
n runs is that the it ha
s flanges, sort of...in 
other words, the way, the reason a train doesn't
 derail is because the wheels are open on 
the outside but if pieces of steel going down 
so that the piece of steel always presses 
against the lip of the rail and the trick then 
is to blow up the heaviest part of the train, 

which is the tender.  In other words, th
e steam...these are steam locomotives by the 
ways...the heaviest part of th
e train is where you have the water and the coal, which is 

usually about fifteen me ters be
hind the front of the train.  I 
mean, these are standard-sized 
locomotives and the way "Batko" explains it a
ll you have to do is knock out the rail under 
the tender, the heavy part , and derail the tend
er.  The tender will tip over and pull the rest 
of the train down from t he embankme nt.  So 
you know, this is an art form.  So far as 
"Batko" is concerned, derailing trains is an ar
t form.  The...and then he, of course, he is 
full of stories.  You know, as we sit there he te
lls me  stories.  He is
 a very lively kind of a 
guy.  Uh again, the squad is eight people, thr
ee Russians and five Slovaks of whom four 
are communists (including one of them who fo
ught in the Spanish ci vil war), so that's 
that's the squad and the guy who fought in th
e Spanish Civil War, it's it's a father and a 
son so there's father and son in the squad.  
That's that's the ma keup of the squad.  Get 
along very well.  And uh the idea then is to 
lay the TNT under the rail, connect a fuse so 
that when the first wheel of the steam engine come s and crushes the fuse it will igni te the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
32 
 
detonator.  OK?   And the detonator then will ig
nite a cord and the cord goes at the rate of 
one second every twenty centimeter
s, so that the speed of the train is about forty miles an 
hour, thirty miles an hour, you need a cord appr
oximately four feet long so that when the 
first wheel de tonates the thing, the train w
ill have passed approximately fifteen meters 
and it will blow right under the 
wheel of the tender.  Again 
this is this is...now we'r e 
doing with professionals.  The problem with mo
st of the partisans 
that  existed and the 
stories that you hear about partisans...these were all amateurs.  This is this is this is ki ller 

stuff.  Highly specialized.  So uh we lay the 
TNT.  We  lay the fuse, but we don't put the 
fuse on top of the rail, because we are going to
 do it only when we get a freight train.  We 
don't want to blow up a passenger train.  Uh and so that's how we do it for the first time.  

Uh we know by sound how this thing works.  
Uh we can tell a frei
ght train.  "Batko" 
knows how to tell a freight train.  We  go b
ack to the embankme nt about mi dnight, maybe 
eleven o'clock.  I don't reme mber.  By that time  it rains.  The field that is between the 

embankme nt...you know, it's only about two hundred
 me ters but it's a it's a soggy field 
and uh between the field there is a path whic
h is beaten but everything else has been 

plowed.  I mean this is Se ptember.  This 
is a wheat field.  It has been plowed, and 
"Batko" says, "You just ma ke sure that you're in
 there where the path is."  So we go back 
up.  When the uh when when "Batko" says, "I'v
e seen we've got a freight train," and we 
go back up on the embankme nt and we crouch 
against the embankment and we wait until 
we see the lights of the freigh
t train.  You have to see th
e lights of the freight train 
because if the Germans have what's called a draisienne [
NB:
 a handcar], which is a little 
platform or a a little armored car ahead of it
...they usually used to 
push a flat car...later by 
the way they had hostages on the on the flat car 
with them fr om the lo
cal villages but this 
time they didn't...you want to ma ke sure they do
n't blow up the uh flat car.  And of course 
this was still early, and I don't think on the fi
rst train the Germans expected anything.  
You know, they used a rail car.  This is the ma in rail line between Danube and Poland by 

the way.  This is the train line fr om Bratisla
va to _ilina to Katowice, and the Germans did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
33 
 
not know whether the Russians are going to 
attack through the Danube Valley or through 
the Vis_a [
NB:
 Vistula] Valley, so those three li
nes that were going north-south were 
critical to the ability of the 
Germans to shift troops back and forth.  They were running 
out of troops, out of out of tr
oops and out of uh the ability to
 defend, so those three lines 
were very dependent.  The Ukrainian command 
had four squads who had nothing else to 
do except keep those lines, lines harassed.  And by the way, when you blow up that line, 

usually it gets cleared up in about a half
 a day.  The the objective...Yah, I mean you 
cannot disable the line unless you blow up a bri...a ma jor bridge which you couldn't do.  I 

mean the bridges were extremely well defende
d.  That's the fi rst thing the Germans took 
care of.  All you can do is ma ke it difficult 
for the Germans, ma ke the m go slow, uh 
divert arms, go into com... and and deploy 
troops to keep the lines clear so you you 
really...it's a harassing act.  It's it's it's it's it's 
a bee bite.  It's  not deadly stuff, but that's  
what guerrilla warfare is all about.  So so uh 
we have to wait until we see the lights of the 
of the uh of the of the train, and as we  go 
back to arm this thin
g, uh "Batko," who is 
going to do that, hands over to me  the detonato
rs.  It's a box.  The the the detonators are 
in a box.  It's it's a sort of leather pouch.  These are little cartridges a
bout this big.  It has 
uh ful minate of me rcury.  If you hit it, it expl
odes.  It's ...these are the igniters that you 
have in all ammunition.  And while he's fitting 
the fuse he holds, asks me  to hold uh that 
leather box which is lined with cotton and ha
s these detonators.  Now what I didn't know 
was that we had more TNT than we had detona
tors.   We  we re short in detonators.  And 

so this train keeps comi ng.  You see th
e lights and there is "Batko," you know, uh 
mounting this detonator on that fuse and I'm pret
ty cool and uh as I hand it to him I spill 
all the detonators right on the uh embankment,
 which is ma de out of gravel and "Batko" 
says, "You better get those."  I mean...and and this
 this is serious stuff.  So...and he starts 
running off the embankme nt because the tr
ain is comi ng.  I stand there on the 
embankme nt, pick up the detonators, put th
em in my pocket, you know.  And when I 

picked up all the detona....by that
 time I have light from the 
train.  I just start running 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
34 
 
down the embankment and I mi ss the, it's cal
led the "medza"...the th
e little space between 
fields where you can walk is called a "medza." 
 And uh I mi ss it, so 
I hit the plowed wet 
field, which is really a potfull of mu d a
nd I just uh go, you know, ma ybe  uh twenty feet 
or something and then I see the train sort 
of chugging and I look 
over my shoulder and I 
say, "Well, this is just about when it's goi
ng to blow."  I hit the ground and the train 
blows.  And you could see the front end of th
e car and the engine slowly....it's like slow 
motion...it sort of...it's it's funny, you know.  I coul
d see it like today.  It just blows and 
then slowly starts going off the e mba nkme nt a
nd then pulls the front cars.  The front cars 
had some tanks on it.  I mean it was a troop 
train, and in the mi ddle was...the Germans 
had uh uh you know ma chine gun nests and you hear, pop...it's there what you call flares, 
and the way a flare works, a flare gun...it's a 
big barrel gun.  It's  a rocket.  You hear the 
pop.  It's  like on Fourth of July.  You always 
hear the ignition and th
e take-off and it only 
ignites when it gets up on the top.  So I st
ay on the ground.  You know, I I hear, I feel the 
hot stuff uh from the from the steam escaping 
from the from the train and the iron's flying 
around but didn't hit me , and there I see a white
 light comi ng down.  They've shot it over 
very far, and of course "Batko" by that ti
me was scrambling up the embankment and so 
they started shooting at him. 
 Didn't hit him.  So as soon 
as the flare dies out, I start 
running down the field.  Now ma ybe the Germ
ans had only one flare gun, or ma ybe the 
guy who's s hooting the flare gun was very sl
ow, but the the uh you know there were 
intervals, enough intervals betw
een the uh flare guns that I 
could always...when I hear a 
pop I hit the ground and waited, and of course 
they were raking with ma c hine gun fire 
with tracers over the field.  They didn't  know wh
at they were shooting at.  Uh they didn't 
see that there was an embankment actually going 
up.  They were just so
rt of raking at eye 
level.  And I ma de it up the embankme nt
.  You know, it's it's...you will se e from the 
picture...it's it's not a big distance but it's an
 interminable distance under fi re.  And uh uh 
our guys didn't  shoot back.  It it...our guys we
re going to shoot back only, because then 
you reveal your fire and then you draw fi
re.  You only shoot when you see the troops 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
35 
 
dismounting and pursuing.  Yeah, you only 
shoot against...I mean these were 
professionals.  I mean amateurs would 
have popped their guns, you know, started 
shooting willy nilly and then the Germans w
ould have shooted willy nilly, and but these 
were really professionals, particularly the 
guy from the Spanish civil war.  This was a 
cool cucumber.  I mean this guy was an absolu
te professional killer.  Uh by the way, this 
guy after the war became the uh head of a trial. 
 He was the head judge that hanged Tiso.  
He was the...he became a judge.  This this one judge you wouldn't want to come  in fr ont 
of.  At any rate, a great guy.  So I get 
up the embankme nt and they were lying down 
there.  They were waiting for me .  One one
 of the things in a commando squad is, in a 

professional commando squad, you don't let your
 guys hang around.  Now if they get 
wounded, you shoot them.  OK.  Be cause you don't want them to fall into enemy hands, 

but but there's a funny et hic in a in that kind 
of attack, that that you really protect your 

people.  You don't have that ma ny and so they said OK, you ma de it.  Did OK.  So then 

we go up in the mountain and and uh we uh we
 stop and uh at a lit
tle clearing and of 
course we hear the crackl e from there and 
the Germans are firing firing wildly but it's 
dark, it's  raining, so you know, the the bullets
 are not even comi ng close to us.  And uh 
"Batko" says "OK, now let's regroup."  He 
pulls out his pistol a
nd points it at me ..."You 
lost our caps.  We  cannot go on anotherraid.  You lost my caps.  That's 

punish...punishable.  You know, we 're going 
to shoot you, you Jew kid!" you know.  And 
I said, "Well, what do you mean?   I got them
."  And I go in my pocket and I pulled the 
detonators out of my pocket and everybody sort
 of goes to the side (laughter).  "This 
kid"...I mean, "how did you ma ke it because you
 know, if you would have hit it...I mean 
if you hit it like that, you would have blown" 
...apparently I wa s totally oblivious to it but 
the mud was  so soft that whenever I hit the 
ground...I me an it would have tore off my leg.  

So this "Batko" says, "Boy, are you lucky.  You are so lucky.  We  we 'r e going to put you 

right into the squad.  We need a little luc
k," so so I became as a result of that uh the 
me mber of the squad and uh then they took me
 back and they trained me  how to do it, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
36 
 
and uh then I did a number of raids with them
.  Uh "Batko" wa s sort of a braggart.  I 
mean he wa s a real braggart and one day we 
were just mov...coming back from a raid and 
we were very tired.  "Batko" says, "I'm not
 going to slug through th
e mountains," because 
we used to go off the paths and what have you. 
 This was al... already in Oc tober.  Things 
were getting pretty tough and the German pa
trols were all over the pl ace, and he said, 
"We are we are just going to go on the road,"
 and we said, you know, "You can't do that."  
"Oh, we'r e going to go down the road."  So we say, "Well, we'r e going going to walk in 
the ditch," because I me an to walk in the mi
ddle of the road during the day it was, it was 
insane.  He says, "I'm jus t  too tired to to
 slug through the ditch." 
 Again, it was raining 
and sloshing and what have you.  So we walked down the road, and suddenly a German 

patrol came up.  They had a machine gun and this crazy "Batko" stood in the mi ddle of 

the road with his uh PTS, which is this th
is Russian uh automa tic with the seventeen...it 
looks like gangster...it's a knock-off of a Al Ca
pone gun.  And he stands in the mi ddle of 
the road and the...you know...that patrol truc
k with a ma chine gun on top, stands there 
and shoots...stands...he doesn't, didn't budge.  
You know, we were in 
the ditch.  And he 
just stands and they just cut him down.  He wa
s going to get that truck.  So we lost him, 
and after that the squad just didn't have luc
k.  I mean, we just...the other two Russians 
were not very good.  Uh, I, I don't know why, but
, but, but just the lu
ck ran out of it and 
then, uh, on Nove mber 2nd, uh, we had the mi sfort
une to get mi xed up in a fight that we 
really didn't belong to.  Uh, the Germans alwa
ys tried to move the partisans that were 
rema ining.  By, you know, by the 28th they clean
ed up the fixed position, they destroyed 
the army, the soldiers we re fighting with 
tanks.  The Jews...there was a two hundred-man 

Jewish brigade from Nováky who was given on 
open field the job of holding the line for 
retreating soldiers ... against advancing German
 t a nks.  I mean total slaughter, and then 
the Germans had Ukrainians Sonderkomma ndos
, not German, to go after the remainder 
of the troops...uh you know, just driving us up 
into little enclaves, surrounding us and 
then just  wiping us out because these were 
extremely skilled anti-guerrilla uh operations.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
37 
 
I mean these were professional operations for 
uh getting rid of guerrillas.  I me an there's 
there's are whole ways how you go after guerr illas.  And uh I think that the the two 
Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep
 with others because of
 food or whatever and 
so in November we got uh we joined a bi
gger gr oup because we were going to move our 

base and we got caught, surrounded on the moun
tain.  I mean there was snow by that 
time.  It was snowing by that time.  You 
know, it was like a foot of snow and uh they 
drove us on a mountain which had the...was su
rrounded on one side with the river, on the 

other side with a with a road and uh they we
re just firing uh uh shrapnel all day into the 
mountain.  We were taking heavy, heavy casualt
ies.  You see, in those days when you 
took a...when you were wounded, you were...you mi ght
 as well shoot yourself and so uh 
they were shooting at us all day and then dur
ing the night they went
 after us, which was 
very unusual, and the way they went after us, 
they pretended that they were Russians.  
These were Vlasov ...these were the Vlasov 
guys, and so I got separated in Nove mber 
from the, from the squad.  That night uh 
I and another guy from the squad, who by the 

way was a criminal.  You know, the the ma keup of of this group was...got more and more 

unsavory as time went on, and as we were on th
e ridge of the mountain 
and we just rolled 
down the mountain and uh we crossed the river.
  Now this was Novembe r ...iced river, all 
slippery, in snow, and we waded the rive
r and uh we escaped the the uh surrounding, but 
everybody else was involved got e
ither captured, or shot, or ki
lled.  Uh I think there mu st 
have been some thing like two hundred partis
ans on that mountain.  I think only about 
twenty, thirty got away, and uh soaking wet uh 
we started ma rching east.  By that time  
we decided we are going to just move towa
rds the front, and uh then I joined another 
brigade and then starting in December we st
arted slowly fighting our way east.  I only 

went on one more raid in January, and by th
at time  I had pleurisy and I was bleeding 
and...I was...after February I didn't fight anymor
e.  I couldn't.  I mean just could hardly 
walk.  Uh I crossed the lines about uh four 
hundred kilome ters east of where I joined the 
partisans.  In other words, we started walk
ing towards the Russian front, and we finally 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
38 
 
crossed the line on March 25th, 1944 [
NB:  
This must be 1945, since he joined the 
partisans in Sept. 1944], so I jo
ined the partisans on the 4th of September and joined the 
Czechoslovak army...it turned out when we
 crossed the front we ran into the 
Czechoslovak brigade.  It was comi ng out of
 Soviet Union.  Uh the Russians imme diately 
got separated from us because they were al
l suspect of being collaborators, using the 
partisans purely as being a cover for them and 
there was quite a bit of
 that so they...all the 
Russians immediately the mo ment we cr
ossed the front immediately went for 

interrogation by the NKVD.  Uh early in uh March we also picked up five Americans 

fliers who were wandering through the mountains who uh who had been shot down and 

who who just stayed with th
e partisans, although they refu
sed...this was a very peculiar 
thing...the y refused to carry arms because th
ey were protected by the Geneva Convention 
if they didn't carry arms and you know, we told them..."Look, you guys,...I mean I me an, 

you're not going to enter a long debate wit
h, with, with the Sonderkomma ndo when they 
catch you."  No, they didn't  want to carry arms
.  Uh we also picked up an agent from the 
British ISA uh OSS.  The mi sfortune of that
 guy was that appa rently he wa s carrying 
quite a bit of cash and gold on him.  He was dropped that way and uh the Russians 

accused hi m of being a spy and they shot him.  I mean there's some really ghastly st ories 

I could tell you.  I mean pretty ghastly stuff.  But I didn't get wounded.  I was just just 

totally, you know, physically and me ntally worn 
out and had abscesses and sores all over 
the place.  I mean a real sorry st ate.  I th
ink I mu st have weighed, and lost, less than a 
hundred pounds when I crossed the lines. 
I got imme diately picked up uh by the 
Czechoslovaks and they shipped me  to the hos
pital and I stayed in 
the hospital during the 
month of April.  Uh I had all the food...I 
mean just couldn't have enough food.  And uh 
on the 20th of April, I volunteered to to the Czechoslovak army to go back to the front, so 

then I uh was inducted in, back into the re
gular army and uh as we went through the 
induction period, you know, suddenly there is 
a colonel there and he said, "You know, 
you have this unbelievable military record here. 
 Uh we need you in uh really in a special 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
39 
 
assignment.  We  are going to send you to o
fficer school," and I said, you know, "But the 
war will be over!", I sai
d.  "Oh, we'l l ma ke you an officer in two weeks."  So I was se nt 
uh on the 20th of April to a real quickie bat
tlefield officer school. 
 Turned out it was a 
school of what do you do with collaborators. 
 They needed sort of a few people that 
would come  over and uh go through Sudetenlan
d.  I mean there was some ...all of that 
thing was laid out so I uh...at graduation th
ey discovered that I was only sixteen years 
old.  Until then, nobody asked me  and they just  couldn't ma ke me  an offi cer, so they 
ma de me  a non-commiss i oned officer, whatev
er that me ans.  So immediately after 
liberation I was shipped uh to Bratislava.  
Uh, of course I stopped home.  Nobody wa s 
there.  I found out that my si
sterand my mother were bot
h picked up uh in October in, 
you know, in their hiding places.  So my instin
ct was right.  I mean the staying in the 

hiding place would have been just terrible. 
 And uh so I went to Bratislava, and we 
started hunting the Nazis and I did that for a
bout four months and th
e thing just got too 
ghastly for me.  I mean I mean I me an we we 
just did pretty rotten things and and uh we 
we uh settled scores.  I mean it was a pretty
 wild period.  And uh then my sister came  
back from the concentration camp in June, a
nd I just told my superiors I had enough of 

this thing.  You know, I just didn't have the 
stomach, so uh they said, "Well uh most of 

the Nazis fled anyway so we don't ha ve as bi
g a job to do as we t
hought we have to do 
and besides you're sixteen years old," and uh th
ere were some  other reasons.  They say, 
"Well why don't you just go home ? "   So I wa
s honorably discharged from the army and 
then I went home .  At the age of sixt
een, a non-commissioned 
officer, uh gun-toting, uh 
no education, uh no schooling since '39, '40, and 
uh and I decided, had to decide what to 
do with mys e lf and my decision was when I 
went back uh to Slovakia and and I saw the 
accumulation of grudges...and it has nothing to do
 with the communist plot or anyt hing 
like that.  It's just...the the totalitari an regime
, the the bureaucratic structure, the the theft, 
the institutionalized theft, the legalized uh de
struction of people...I concluded at the age 
of sixteen that that regardless what...and 
you know, I was going to get the property back 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
40 
 
and since I was the sole male heir of 
a huge, huge property, factories and God knows 
what because my uncles got killed and ev
erythi ng else, you know, uh there was every 
reason for me to stay there and I said I'm just not going to do it, so I walked out in 
January of 1948, before the communists took over.  
Just walked out.  I went first to Paris.  
Then I went to London.  There was a friend of
 my  father's, not fa mily, who uh sort of 
picked me  up and uh very dear friend of my 
father's.  He was not ma rried and uh he sort 
of fed me , put me  through school, private tutori
ng, and I arrived in uh in England early in 
February 1948 and then I finally
 got a visa to, as as an or
phan, to America and I arrived 
in America in October of 1948. 
 

Q:Take a couple of mi nutes, a
nd we have a couple of mi nutes... 
 

A:Yeah. 

 

Q:Tell us what your adjustme nt to the United States has been. 

 

A:That's a long story.  That's a long story.  Uh, you know, so far as I'm concerned, America...the 
gold is on the streets.  You can just pick
 it up.  You know, you know...that was my vis i on 
of America.  I was dreami ng about America 
when I was still starving and ma rching.  And 
I don't know why.  You know, just going to Ame r
ica...that wa s going to
 be the thing.  I 
wanted to have peace.  I just wanted to have
 peace.  So my adjustment was that I just  
wanted to have peace and raise a family.   
 

Q: What do you think the effect of the war has been on you? 

 

A:I think it has been very good.  I think it has be
en very good.  I think 
that uh...I know this is 
almost a sacrilege to say, but I'm a better pers
on for that.  But I'm just a lucky one.  There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
41 
 
are very very few who a r e able to to 
walk through the war without the ultimate 
degradation, the dignity to huma n to huma nity.  See, I was always a person.  I could 
always stand up.  I never owed anything toanybody.  And I think the biggest crime, and 

it's not just the Nazis although that's an
 extreme form, is the degradation and 
demoralization, the the the total 
helplessness that people get in an environment.  And t he 
great thing about America, you can be whatev
er you want to be, and uh I think I'm a 
much better person for that.   
 

Q:Tell us what you do now. 

 

A: We ll, uh like my fathe r  I always have an obligation to society and uh uh I came in in uh '48.  I 
was very lucky to be accepted to the only sc
hool in America that gave full tuition uh 
scholarship to every student, which is Coope
r Union.  Cooper Union in New York is the 
only place I could afford going.  I couldn't ev
en afford going to City College because I 
didn't have $130 to pay for lab fees.  And uh al
ways wanted to be an engineer.  Always, 
since a child.  I went to HIAS on La fayette St
reet in '48 when I arrived and uh I went to 

the counselor and I said, you know, "I want to 
be an engineer," and they say, "Kid, you 

know, you have no education, no schooling, nothing.  And you have no money and we 

don't know what to to say."  I say, "Well, I just 
want to be an engineer," so so finally the 
counselor in desperation said
 "You know, around the corner 
is this crazy school that 
everybody who gets in gets paid everything.  W
hy don't you try them out? "  So I went to 
this this Cooper Union and I talked to th
e admi ssion officer and he said, "You know, it's 
pretty tough.  Have you ever taken an SAT? "  
I said, "Well, what's an SAT? "  "Well, you 
know, fill these forms and what have you."  My
 English was pr etty poor so I sat for an 
SAT exa m without any of the cultural b
ackground, as you must understand, to take a 
multiple choi ce forms...it is a pretty crazy 
thing.  Turned out that because of Cooper 
Union rating...my English was terrible, but for 
spacial relationships I got a perfect scor e.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0227  
42 
 
You know, when you turn a cube this way, is it li
ke this cube or that
 cube?   I thought it 
was a game .  I got into computer, uh Coope
r Union, but not...I got in because some body 
backed out, so I went to Cooper Union, 
worked my way through Cooper Union, and uh 
me t my wife  at Cooper Union.  And then uh 
I felt I was not sufficiently educated and 
then I uh got a scholarship to MIT Sloane
 School--and uh just to tell you the attitude, 
although I was totally abjectly
 poor, I...you know, I wore work
 clothing that I...second-
hand clothi ng--I refused to take the scholarsh
ip.  I said, "I'm going to work my way 
through through through MIT and the reason is 
the Strassman's don't take charity from 
anybody."  So I walked, uh went and got a Mast
er's Degree in Industrial Manageme nt and 
I did the fi rst dissertation in th
e United States of business applic
ation of computers.  I just 
happened to fall into computers in
 1954.  I mean this was just 
just just just a stupid piece 
of luck.  The only place where there was a comp
uter and so I stayed with computers since 
'54 and if you got into computers in '54, 
honestly, you were a total idiot. I mean, you 
know, just just couldn't do wrong.  So I stay
ed with computers my entire career until 
retireme nt in 1985, when I was the Chief Information Executive for the Xerox 

Corporation worldwide.  I ma naged computer
s for General Foods, Kraft and Xerox, but I 
stayed my entire career, uh thirty years, in co
mputers.  Didn't change, and now I'm retired 
and uh I write.  I teach.  I have two profe
ssorships and uh I serve on a six-ma n board to 
the Secretary of Defense  uh again helpi
ng out on on how to manage comp uters for 
increasing the defense of
 the United States.   
 

Q:On that note we stop.
