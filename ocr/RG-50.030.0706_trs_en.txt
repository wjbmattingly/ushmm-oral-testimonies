Q: Yeah, what was his name, first name?  
A: His name was 
h-u-g -o
, 
Hugo 
Pekarek
. And the whole family was 
Pekarek
, I 
can show you some pictures of a cousin of mi ne,
 Pekarek
. And we changed it only 

after the war. 

Q: Oka y. When you were born, wh-what t own were you born in, or what place were 
you born?  
A: Capital of 
Czechoslovakia
, which was 
Prague
. I was born in 
Prague
, I was 
raised in 
Prague
, until the situation has changed. 

Q: Can you tell me what part of 
Prague
, what  section of 
Prague
? 

A: I was born in the old section of 
Prague
, which was very si mi lar t o what we call 

in 
New York
, the east Œ 
Lower East Side
 of 
New York
. The bil Œ remember Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that was 1929 when I was born. So the buildings were usually four flights up. 
The more modern buil ding at that time, had an elevator. Not the buil ding I was born 

at. You had to walk the four flights, and we were living on the top floor. Why we 

were living on that top floor? Because when my mother married my father, her 

mother was living in that apart ment , and in those da ys people were living toget her, 

so we were born in that  apartment where my, actually grandmother, was already 

living.

Q: So tell m Œ 
A: And that was on the fourth floor. 

Q: Do you remember t he address?  

A: Sure. 

Q: Whatis it?
 
A: I have to say the way it sounds in Czech. 

Q: Sure. 

A: The number was 11, and the street was called 
Bilkova
. That™s 
b
 li ke in boy,

,
 Bil kova Ulice
. 
Ulice
 is street. 
Q: And was it in t he center of town then?  

A: Very much so, yes. In Œ 

Q: Was it Œ 
A: Œ the old section of 
Prague
. 
Q: Was it near the cem etery, the old Jewish cemet ery? 

A: There was a Jewish cath Œ I would call it cathedral. There was a Jewish section 

very close, yes, on the next street, so to speak, we had to go sa Œ Jewi sh holida ys 

[indecipherable]
 we used to walk with m y father, I remember very well, to the 

temple. So the temple was, you would sa y like, you go s Œ the main street, which 

was called after 
Pari s
, the town in 
France
. So the street was 
Pari s
 Œ

Q: How do you sa y it i n Czech?  
A: Œ of course in Czech it sounded different than when I say it in English. But the 

name was still the t own, 
Paris
. 

Q: What was the Czech version? How did you say it in Œ what was the street name? 

A: 
, 
Pazheesh
(ph) Œ 
Paris
, i n Engli sh Œ 
Q: 
Pa zheeshka
(ph). 
A: Œ is 
Pa
˝
 
in Czech. 
Q: Oka y, so it™s 
Pa zheeshka
(ph). 
A: 
Pa zheeshka
(ph) 
Ulice
, yes.
 
Q: 
Pazheeska
(ph) 
Ulice
. 
A: And when you cross that street, that was that old section, which was the Jewish 

sec
tion. We hada
 Jewi sh temple, Jewish synagogue and very small cemeter
y,  
because it was in town. So the ce metery was not bigger than this room where we sit. 
But that™s where, usual l y, the Jewish people congregated on holi da ys. I don™t see 

where it™s actually Jewish, or religious, no, but there were holy days where m y 

father, whether he want ed to show his son, or whatever, so we went t o the templ e, 

and spent some ti me in the temple. When I was 13, I was Œ I had 
Bar Mitzvah
. But 
then, because of the circumstances, you know, which unch Œ 
fa

started, you are not so proud to be Jewish. That was Œ you know, it was alwa ys a 
handicap, so to speak, i n m y life. 

Q: Even in 
Czechoslovakia
, before 
Hitler
 
came?
 
A: No, before 
Hitler
 came, everything was normal, nobody cared whether you are 
Jewish or Catholic or 
[indeciphera bl
e]
. Theonl y question 
Œ we used to play soccer, 
because soccer was the sport in 
Euro pe
, so the question was only, what position did 
youplay? Nobody ask
 about religi on, or where you came from, or Œ was Œ 
was not 
the subject to talk about. You were Czech, the Czech name, and you were Czech as 

everybody else, and look, that was not an issue, and Œ as much as I remember Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ it was not an issue when you were growing up, no. 

Q: And Œ in your l ife, it wasn™t.

In m y life

Q: No. Because I™m going to ask questions. I want to, in the begi nning of the

ask about t he peopl e that you knew. And we™ve talked a lit tle bit about your father, I 

want to know more about hi m, I want to know about your mother, any other 

siblings. So if you will allow, I wil l ask questi ons about Œ  
A: Well, I tell you Œ

A: There was a brother who I have never met, he passed awa y of some kind of a 

child disease. My parents Œ m y mother was born in 1892. My father, 1878, about 14 

years apart. But in t hose da ys, people were at home. You know, m y mother was 
always at home, cooking.

A: And you know, the very Œ I remember my mother, you know, she was alwa ys 
cooking. The main dish was lunch, not like in t he 
United States
. The distanceswere 

different, so people were eating lunch at home. And in the evening was always 

something which t he y either warmed up, or something special, you know, some 

sausage or somethi ng, which was the thing which people ate in 
Prague
 at that time. 
My father was Œ he was representing a factory which produced sweaters, cardigans 
and stuff like that. 
Prague
, of 
Czechoslovaki a
 is a reasonably cold setting. If you 

wanted t-to really get warm, so to speak, you had to Œ not fl y, there was no planes Œ 

you had to travel down to 
Etherli s
(ph), t hrough 
Austria
, and that ™s where the warm 

weather really was Œ existed. But coming back to my family, so m y father came 

home, usually in t he evening. We had dinner Œ I mean, what we had for dinner, he 

had for dinner, and everyt hing was normal. It was a very normal life. My mother Œ 
now it might sound strange here, because everything is pre-cooked, and pre-packed 
and stuff like that, but you know, when my Œ I remember t here was a bed in the 

kitchen, and I was a very sick chil d somehow, so I was very much staying in that 

bed during da ytime. And I remember m y mother when she was making pasta. Well, 

the pasta had to be made from scratch, you know, it was eggs, and whatever she put 

in, I don™t remember, but it was on a plate, and she was cutting i t, you know. 

Q: And how did you Œ what did you call it , in Czech?

A: The past a?  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Ah, now it escapes, the word. How would you call pasta? It will come back to 

me.
 
Q: Oka y. Did Œ 
A: It was Œ  somehow I, lately that I want to say something, and I miss the word, and 
then it comes back, you know? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But that™s how she was making the pasta, which goes Œ which went into the soup. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And that™s how I remember m y mother. Then Œ then Œ  
Q: And now it™s a delicacy. 
A: Oh, sure. That was how it Œ

sudden, a word which you have not heard for Œ 

Q: So many years. 

A: Œ 60 odd years, is very difficult to remember, you know? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But this how i t was, and I remember my mother, after lunch, with everything had 
to be spotless, and cleaned, and God forbid somet hing was on the floor, had to be 

polished, you know, and was a Œ 

Q: Did she have any help at home? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: Did she have any help at home, or did she do this all herself? 

A: She was the Œ by herself. It was nonexi stent. In the afternoon, we were kids, l ike 
I said, so in the afternoon we went  to a certain spot on the mountain. There was a 
mountain nearby. The boys pla yed soccer, of course. I don™t remember what my 

sister was doing, whether she was there too, or whether sh-she was 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: Would you mean 
Œ by mountain, do you mean like a hi lly area? Would you tal Œ 
be talking about 
Vyıehrad

A: Well, yes, it was not  really a very hilly 
area,

talking about soccer, you know, pla ying soccer. 
Q: Of course. 

A: Then the y went home, evening, and you had the dinner at home. That was 

summerti me. Winterti me, well wi ntertime, you went somewhere to skate. Now in 

those da ys we didn™t have an ice skating stadium. But tha Œ because it was a cold 

country, the tennis courts is where you s Œ 
that were 
Œ you know, t he y just put water 
on it, that froze because of the cold weather, and then during the da y you went to

skate on a tennis court. Now, it was not tennis court for us, we were ca-calling it ice 
skating rink, you know. 

Q: Of course, of course. 

A: But this Œ that™s how life used to be. 

Q: Your Œ your parents, I™d like to know a little bit about their persona
lities. What 
kind Œ was your father outgoing, an extrovert, an introvert? 
A: No, I think he was Œ I remember the place where he used to go, what the y used to 

call coffee shop, and I remember at that ti me, t hat coffee shop in Œ when he took me 

to see, or whatever, it was so terrible full of smoke, because in those days peopl e 

were smoking, irrespective of health, or whatever, they were smoking. So when I 

went with m y father to that room, 
thethingwhatimpressed me most, my memory, 
was the terri ble smoke. An
d you know
, he sai d, you speak to his people who were 
pla ying cards with him, and stuff like that. Then, most li kely m y mother picked me 
up, and we went wherever we went . 

Q: Did Œ 

A: You know, he was not a com Œ extra Œ he was a regular father, in my opinion. 

Unfortunately, what happened later, naturally wi Œ no, I shouldn™t sa y split. The 

circumstances split us. You know, because I got married very young. Can I dwell  on 

this subject with you?  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
14
 
Q: We™ll come to that. We™ll come to that. Your Œ 
are 
Œ 
were you
 closer to one 
parent or the other? 

A: Well, I t hink as a boy I was closer to m y mother, yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I remember very distinctly as a boy, we used to go shopping. The 
Macys 
was 
called 
[speaks Czech] 
I don™t know if you heard it from some other person. 
Q: I™ve lived in 
Prague
. 
A: Oh, you did live in 
Prague
? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, then you know what I™m talking about 
[speaks Czech] 

Q: 
[Speaks Czech]
 
A: From 
[Czech]
 
were like somehow a small street, and there was a butcher store. 
But he wasn™t selling raw meat, it was more li ke a salami type of a pl ace, you know. 

And I remember wit h m y mother I stopped there, with her of course, and we bought 

pork, which was spesh Œ the Czech Œ one of the main dishes in 
Prague 
was pork. I 
mean, pork was not  like here, you know, pork Œ people don™t eat pork. And I don™t 

eat it now either. My f Œ every da y I fish. But, you know, that changed over the time. 

But back Œ at those Œ at that time, when I was ma ybe 13, 15, I remember that I went 

with my mother, whatevershe wasdoing, on 
t hat 
[speaks Czech]
 I don™t remember, 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

but we went in Œ down south, and there was that butcher st ore where we stopped by, 
and had so me bite of whatever, and go to 
[indecipherabl e]
 
back home.
 
Q: So you a Œ so you would Œ 

A: So she was closer to me than m y father. 

Q: Your father. But  if you ate pork, that means that your parents didn™t observe the 
dietary Œ the pa Œ your parents didn™t observe t he dietary laws Œ 
A: Not at al l, no, no, no. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Wewere bo
rn Jewish, yes, but it was not li ke that we had a Jewish household, 

no. It was a regular household. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No Œ nobody asked these questi ons, that™s how everybody was living. But you 
came to the bil Œ call it building, house, on a Œ on a regular da y, especially Saturday, 
the house was like a Œ 
smelle
d like a restaurant, because everybody was cooking the 
same thing. We were doing the same thing like our neighbors, whether they were 

Jewish, or Christians, or what Œ that was not the subject, nobody cared about this. 

Q: Did Œ 

A: I™m talking about when I was a small boy Œ 

Q: I understand. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

A: Œ I don™t know how it developed later on. 
Q: Of course, of course. Well, 
Czechoslovaki a
 was a new country at the time.  

A: Yes, it was originall y 1918. 

Q: And was there a great feeling of patriotism because it was fine Œ was there a great 

feeling of patriotism because it was fi Œ  
A: Oh, definitely. 
Q: Œ because it was a new country? 

A: Definitely. Not only that, but our const ituti on was identical to the 
U
.
S
. 
constitution, because the 
U 
Œ you know, t he 
United States
 president at that ti me, 

Wilson
, was very instrumental of carving out 
Czechoslovakia
. You would have to 
know more about t he history, but 
Europe
 was occu Œ 
no, Ishoul dn™t say occupied, 
say ruled by the Austri an-Hungarian empire. 
Q: Yes. 
A: And that was the House of the 
Ha psburg s
, king of 
Hapsburgs
, or whatever he 
was, emperor, I don™t remember that part. And everything Œ the l anguage was much 

more German, because the Czechs were part of that Austri an empi re. But then one 

of the Œ one of the principle politicians over there at the time, 
Masarek
(ph), he 

petitioned Œ came here, and he peti tioned 
Wilson
, and I don™t know who came after 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

17
 
hi m, or before hi m, to es Œ to give the Czechs the 
[indecipherable]
 determination 
right. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So the y 
calfed
(ph) out of that Austrian empire afterward, during World War I, 
Czechoslovakia
. There was no 
Czechoslovakia
 before. There was Œ t he state was 
called 
Bohemia
, 
Moravia
, and 
Silesia
. Those were three states whi ch were, so to 
speak, the bone of 
Czechoslovakia
. So when, apparently here, or t here, when they 
realize it™s too small  to be independent, somehow they attached 
Sl ovakia 
to it. And 

that™s why it became 
Czechoslovakia
. The original three states Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ and then anot her t wo or three states t o the Œ I sa y to the Œ to the Œ 

Q: To the east a little bi t. 
A: Œ to the right Œ to Œ t o east, so t o speak.  
Q: Yeah
,  yeah
. 
A: So, the very east ern part of 
Czechoslovaki a
 was very close to 
Russia
, and that™s 
why it was so, later on, during World War II, 
Czechoslovakia
 Œ 
Czechoslovakia
 
was ceded t o the R ussi an sphere of influence. 
Q: We™ll come to those things. We™ll come to t hose things. 

A: Well, that™s the truth.

Q: So, tell me a lit tle bi t about school life. You Œ when di d you Œ 
A: That Œ schools? 

Q: You Œ your school life. What kind of Œ 
A: Well, the Œ 

Q: Œ school did you go to? 
A: Œ school Œ I went to a German school, because at Œ wi Œ you know, 
Czechoslovakia
, that time there was no 
Czechoslovakia
, so when 
Czechoslovakia
 
was founded, just like here, you had a better chance to get a positi on when you 

speak Spanish, and certainly Engli sh. So there, m y mother, I remember her sa ying 

all the ti me, whatever you want to do in life, you have to talk Czech, which was our 

language Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ but you have learn German. So, I went to a German school. 
Q: Did you speak Œ 
at home 
Œ  
A: Yes?  

Q: Œ I just want to establish, you spoke Czech with your Œ  
A: Ch Œ oh, sure. 

Q: Oka y. Did your parents know Yiddish at all? 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
19
 
A: Not at al l. The first t ime I heard Yiddish, you would not believe it , when I was 
going to 
Auschwitz
. I never heard of Yiddish. There was Czech, or German. Now, 

if you didn™t speak wel l German, ma ybe you had some ki nd of a mishmash of 

German, but not Yiddish. I have Œ m y friends they was all 
Czechs, I mean,who 
spoke anyt hing else but Czech? 
Q: Your Œ did you know anything of your famil y history, be yond your father and 
motherand ma ybe grandparents?
 
A: Yes, th- this Œ somehow Œ m y father used to sa y that his family came from Œ t hat 
would be west Œ from the southwest of 
Bohemi a
. And he was Œ he t hought that his 

ancestor were Catholics, but there were Œ you know, there was all kinds of reforms 

going on under Œ not 
Martin Luther K ing
 
here 
Œ 
Q: I know.  
A: Œ but the original 
L uther
.  
Q: Right. 
A: And there was al so somebody in Œ in 
Prague
 by the name of 
Jan Hus
, 
h-u -s
.  
Q: Yes. 

A: So there was a certain split in the Œ in the religion. 

Q: And certainly within Catholicism. 

A: That™s correct. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
20
 
Q: In the Middle Ages. 
A: And Œ and he thinks that instead of choosing the sides between the two split 

C
zech 
Œ Cat holic rel igion, that the y chose the Jewish religion. This why our name is 

not Jewish, you know, our name Œ the Jewish, let™s say, names in 
Prague
, the y were 
the 
Feldmans
, like m y wife™s single name, or the 
Schwa rzko pf
(ph), j ust like here. 
Q: The y were like more Germanic names. 

A: Exactly. Now l ook, here somebody is called 
Schwarzko pf
(ph), you know he is 
somehow Jewish.
 

Q: Or German. 

A: Or German. 

Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Well, that was exact l y in 
Prague
. So to know somebody by the name of 
Pekarek
 
and be Jewish, that didn™t exist. And I wi ll tell  you a smal l story when I was a kid, 

and I went t o the German school, not speaking German. But I remember that my 

teacher, that was the first grade, second grade, you know, I was what, six, seven 

years old. Somehow she is Œ there was some question about religi on, and she assign 

me to the cl ass, or t o the ti me to have religi ous schooling, to the Catholic class, 

because of the Czech name. Well, I didn™t speak any German, but somehow I 

objected to it, and I sai d that I was Jewish. Th Œ so she sent me t o the Jewish class, 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

or whatever, but I remember the name, that was not a Jewish name at all. Now, this 
Œ we were Jewish. This Œ we were born as Jewish people, but then, unfortunatel y 

what happened Œ I t old you I was not a very proud Jew, no, because everything what 

happened was because of the Jewish faith. And lots of things happened, ma-
ma ybe 
we come to it. 
Q: Yes, we come to Œ 
A: But so Œ  

Q: I guess Œ 

A: The name I change for different reason. If you want me to tell it to you now, I™ll 

tell it to you now. 

Q: Yes, let™s do Œ let™s Œ let™s do it Œ let Œ tell Œ 

A: Well, we were Œ m y name was 
Pekarek
.  
Q: 
Pekarek
. 
A: I married 
Georgi ne
, she was 
Pekarek
, of course. And then what happened i Œ th-

that was 1947 Œ ™48, the infl Œ at that time, the influence of Soviet 
Russia
 was 

tremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit Œ politics. The Czechs alwa ys felt that 

the west let them down. Th-The Œ 
t he che 
Œ the Œ the west  means 
England
, not the 
United States
, the 
Uni ted States
 was out of this world. But 
England
,
 France
, 

partially 
Italy

identity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, 
Hitler 
marched in, and the 
whole situation has changed. So t he 
Russia
 influence was very strong. We, 
Georgine
 and me, we didn™t care for it, because we have seen what happened when 

you don™t have freedom. We both survived 
Auschwitz
, we came back in 1945, and 

were living in 
Prague
 as best as we could have done it, until ™47 - ™48. But when the 
situation became very, very difficult, we didn™t like it. We thought again, we might 

have to go t hrough the same thing. Ma ybe not the extremes, but hardly t he freedom 

which we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of 
Czechoslovakia
, which 

was 19 four Œ late ™47, early ™48. I couldn™t  get out, because I was, quote, military 

age. So I thought t hat if I somehow split with 
Georgine
, that by m yself I will be 
easier to get out than t wo of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That™s how we 

thought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of 
Hyde
. His name was 
Walter E
. 
Hyde
. Through hi m, I got a Engli sh passport. So 
Georgi ne
 left 
Prague 
in February 
1948. I couldn™t get out  that quickly. In the meantime she went from 
Prague
 to 
London
, sta yed in 
London
 for a while. From her mother™s side, t he y were here, 
surviving t he situation in 
Ecuador
. Now, of the f Œ all these countries, I™ll tell you 

why 
Ecuado r
. That was 
Georgine™s
 uncle from her mother™s side; he was a dentist. 
But he didn™t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board 

of directors here, sit ting on the board of direct ors there. And somehow he 
became

consul general of 
Ecuado r
. Well, howhe got 
Ecuador
, I can™t tell you. But that™s 
how it was. So 
it was 
Œ  unfortunately, the situation became worse, before 
Hitler
 and 
all that stuff. He was trying to convince 
G eorgine™s
 mother and father to go to 
Ecuador
 because he was able to give them the visa to go to 
Ecua dor
. Well, m y 
mother, you know, they were in 
a 
different situation. The y had a house like a house, 
and those da ys there were no mortgages in 
Prague
. So to leave your house, to leave 

your business, that  was unheard of. Why shoul d I go to 
Ecua do r 
to li sten to those 

idiots down there, or
 
something? This is my home. Well, unfortunatel y, i t didn™t  

work out in the long run, but since the y survived in 
Ecuado r
, in 
Quito
, the y came 
after the war here, like most of people usually do. So when 
Georgine
 was in 

England
, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here Œ the y 
were in 
Ecuador 
at  that ti me. But the y know t hey were living in Œ in 
Ecuador
. 
The y came here and t hat uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody 

who was a manufacturi ng person. And because of the Cold War which existed 

already at that ti me, somehow the 
United States
 government was pumping 
much  
more mone y into 
Puerto Rico
, as a prevention that 
Puerto Rico
 wouldn™t go t oo 
much left, like some of the countries did.  

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: So he was Œ he was offered to build a factory in 
Puerto Rico
. So since that uncle, 
who was a dentist representative of 
Ecuado r
, he told hi m, well, if you just came 
from 
Ecuado r
, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my factory 
[indecipherable]
 
from 
Prague
. So they settled to 
Puerto Rico
 for some ti me. So 
Georgine
, not having any other family, from 
England
, went to the 
United States
, 
went to 
Puerto Rico
. 

Q: 
Rico
. 

A: So we stayed, of course, I was in 
Prague
. Not divorced, that was not the question 

[indecipherable]
. But I managed t o get out of 
Prague
. By myself it was easier than 

together wit h 
Georgine
. So, when I got out of 
Prague
, naturally I had nowhere to 

go. But the train took me to 
Paris
. Well, I have to sa y something in favor of the 

Fre
nch, irrespective of their view t oda y, of that view. The French, at that ti me, were 
extremely helpful. They tried to reunite famili es who were split, you didn™t know 

where Œ last  ti me saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it  was very difficult, 

but the French were hel ping. And they were helping also, the people li ke m yself, 

who all of a sudden, from 
Prague
, was in 
Paris
. We were called 
DPs
, displaced 
people. And I got t o 
Paris
 couple da ys before July 14
th
, I™m sure you know what  
July 14
th
 is. Well at  that ti me, of course, that time was the different. That was 1948, 
and 
de Gaulle
 was still  around, and he was running down 
Champs Elysees
, I 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

remember like toda y. When I did go to 
France
, to 
Paris
, I was supposed to see 
somebody whosomebody knew
 
somebody in 
Prague
, and I was supposed to see 
those peopl e. So t hose people took me to that celebration of July 14
th
. Now, 
spreading out this story which I™m just tell ing you, m y sister Œ 
orrather, my mother 

had a sister, who had married a Viennese person, all Jewish, but she di dn™t like the 
situation as it was. And, before 
Hitler 
came i n, she decided, with the husband, to go 
to, at that ti me 
Palestine
. There was no 
Israel
. You had t o take the boat, which was 

very difficult, because 
Prague 
is right in the middle of 
Europe
, there™s no ocean 
around. 

Q: There™s no Czech navy. 

A: There™s no Œ 
no Czech
 navy, no nothing. B ut she managed somehow, through 

someone el se, to get the per Œ the documents, and she survived the 
H itler
 years in 
Jerusalem
. 
[indecipherable]
 I Œ I don™t know which town she survived, but she 
was there. So when she came back t o 
Prague
 looking for her fami ly, but there was 
no family except us, my sister, me. But she di dn™t like it because she said exactly 

what we have found out later on. That it™s too autocratic, t oo left-wingish, and she 

thought there was no future for 
Czechoslovaki a
 to survive again. So somehow she 

has some friends in 
Australia
. So she convinced m y sister to go with her. The Œ

incidentally, the husband of my aunt passed away, and he is buried on 
the mount 
Œ 
what is the name of the mountain in 
Israel
? I forgot the name of the mountain. 
Q: But he™s buried there? 

A: Yeah, he is buried t here. 

Q: Right there. 
A: But she came back by herself, and she convinced m y sister to go with her to 
Australia
. Now, m y sister, you know, she was very much into languages. So, for her 

to speak English, French, Italian, al though she was born in 
Prague
, she spoke all 

these languages. So, she was Œ for her to go to 
Australia 
was no problem, she spoke 

English. So they went t o 
Australi a
. Well, the trip to 
Australia
 by boat, that™s a long 

distance, this is not around the corner. So when they arrived in 
Australia
, I was in 

touch with them, or they were in touch with me, the y helped me to get to 
Australia
. 
And the French Œ 
Q: From 
Paris
? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: From 
Paris
? 

A: From 
Paris
. B ut, from 
Paris
 you had to go to 
Marsei lles
, and the ship to s Œ 

there, took 60 da ys. 

Q:Oh m y goodness.
 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: Well, this how it was. So in the 60 da ys, I got into 
Australia 
in January ™49. I l eft 
July ™48, I got int o 
Australia
 January ™49. So when I go to 
Australia
, of course, 
Georg
ine
, we were married. She t ook the first  plane, and she came to 
Australia
, 
and we were living in 
Melbourne
 for a few years. 
Q: Oka y. At this point we want to find out, when did you become 
Fra nk Hyde
? 
Was it when you got Œ 
A: Because 
Georgi ne
 was Œ sh-
sh
e h
ad a passport in the name of 
Hyde
. 
Q: Ah, so that Œ 

A: So I di dn™t like to be someone else, so I dro Œ and the name, at  that time in 

Australia
, to have a Czech name was 
Œ the y couldn™t pronounce it, and Œ 

Q: Oka y, so m y point Œ m y questi on is, i s did you get that passport when 
Walter 

Hyde 
provided you wit h the Œ and you chose 
Hyde
 as your name, or did you change 
your name when you were in 
Australia
? 

A: No, I changed m y name only after we got t he passport in the 
[indeciphera ble]
 if  
the passport would have been in the name of 
MacDonal d
, I would be 
MacDonald
.  
Q: Excuse me, but what I don™t understand is when that Œ you got that passport 
while you were stil l in 
Prague
, or when you got to 
Australia
? 
A: No, we got it i n 
Prague
, that™s how 
Georgi ne
 got out, she got 
out as 
Georgine
 
Hyde
.

names? 

A: Not at that point, but at Œ 
eventually, yes.
 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. So the Œ 

A: And see, she had the name 
Hyde
, and Œ  
Q: Excuse me, but I don™t understand where is eventually. Is eventual ly when you 

got it in Œ when you got the passports in 
Prague
, or when you were i n 
Australia
? 
A: No, I got that passport in 
Prague
. 
Q: And it had your name, 
Frank Hyde
 in it? 
A: Well, I was still  
Frank 
Pekarek
.  
Q: But she was 
Georgine
 
Hyde

A: Sorry? 
Q: Let™s go back to 
Prague
, it™s the mid to late 1930s, and you™re in school.  
A: Sure. 

Q: And it™s a new country, it™s not even 20 years old. What happens in the political 

atmosphere?  

A: No, yo u see, what happened, when the situation has gradually changing in 

Czechoslovakia
 Œ 

Q: Before the Germans come in? 
A: Before the German came Œ well, the y was Œ I don™t know how much history you 
know, but there were negotiations somehow, t he influence of 
Hitler
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That was a story the other da y in ﬁ
The Wall Street Journal
,ﬂ exactl y whatI™m 

telling you, if the allied forces at that ti me would have done somet hing to stop 

Hitler
, that woul
d not havehappened,but they were
 not interested, ma ybe the

interest was somewhere else. So, he became t oo powerful. There was also a 
recession in that world. Was a recession here Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ 
because 
Œ 
because 
Œ whatever the y call it here. 

Q: Depression. 
A: A depression, t hat™s correct. So, he promised jobs, and he promi Œ he didn™t say 
how, but what he did, you have t Œ again, I™m t alking about history, after World War 

I, the French and German were not alwa ys friends. 

Q: Oka y, excuse me, I™m going to interrupt. What I am interested to know is, did
 

Hitler 
have a
n influence before he marched i n the country, before he marched int o 

Czechoslovakia
, and t ook it over, when you say t hings changed gradually, was i t 

such that it Œ internal li fe in 
Czechoslovakia
 changed for the Jews, even before 
Hitler
 
came?That™s what m
y question is. 
A: Not really. 
Q: Not really. 

A: I Œ not t o m y knowl edge, no. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
32
 
A: No. What changed was, like I said, 
there were
 negotiations, t he y wa Œ he had 
certain demands. The border countries of that old 
Bohemia
, which was somehow 

created by 
Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ this government here, to give them Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ border. That was occupied by German minorities. But since the constitution 

was like here, everybody was alike, and t here was no ant Œ anti-German feeling, or 

anyt hing li ke that. But, let™s go back to that  recession which we had. So, when that 

was all the world was t he depressi on, and 
Hitl er 
promised jobs. Now, how did he 
deliver the j ob? Because, like I started to say, after World War I, the League of 

Nation, which was the forerunner of the United Nations, they thought 
Germany
, not 
Hitler
, there was 
Hi ndenburg
, which was the president. 
Q: Right. 

A: The y told hi m, you cannot go t o this area of 
Euro pe
, and in this area of 
Euro pe
, 
which was called the 
Saar
, 
s-a-a-r
. And another place goes by. 
Q: Right. 

A: Which was something like say, our 
Detroi t
, with the factories of automobiles Œ  

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

33
 
A: Œ and all  this. 
Q: The 
Ruhrgebei t
. 
A: So he i nvaded those two places, and nobody stopped hi m. If the y would have 

stopped him, ma ybe he wouldn™t have been so powerful. But because the y didn™t  

stop hi m, maybe they didn™t have t he power to stop him. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: He has grown. So there was no Œ no anti -Semit ism in 
Prague
, or anyt hing of that 
nation. Everybody was Czech, and on the cont rary, if you didn™t speak well Czech, 

you were Œ 
somehow you 
Œ you were not l iked, if I can say that word. And in t hat 
connection, I woul d also like to tell you, into m y house where I was living, 

somebody moved infrom 
Poland
, ab Œ what used to call is Œ a Polish Jew. His name 
was 
Ehrlstein
(ph). Well, the name tells you al ready, German Jew, so Œ 
he became a 
leader of the Jewish population at that time, because somebody has t o represent t he 
Jews Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ in connection to t he Czech government Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ and what followed , the German government. So he was appointed to be leader 

of the Jewish communi ty. Since he moved int o the house where we were living, 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

spoke poorly Czech Œ German was not liked, because we were now, all of a sudden, 
enemies wit h the German Œ m y mother had his wife to go shopping, and all this 

stuff. Now that 
[indeci phera ble]
 they™re all down the road, why we sta yed in 
Prague
 longer than other people who were already deported, in camp number one. 

Q: Oka y. Let™s come to the point where I™ll  Œ I™ll speed ahead a littl e bit. I Œ I Œ 
oka y, if it is so that life didn™t change in the late 1930s for you, in Œ 
A: Not unt il 1937 - 1938. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It was t he same. 

Q: All right, what happened in 1937?  

A: Well, the Czechs were forced to give up some of these border countries. So t here 

was a resentment against the rest, because officially 
Russia
 was Œ officially. The y 
were not doing much, but officiall y the y were. So, the negotiations were primarily 
between 
Germany
, 
France Œ 
I can even tel l you the name of the prime minister of 
Germany
, who was negotiating at that ti me, wa Œ he was a 
[indecipherable]
 
from 
like a Œ 

Q: Yeah, he was a aristocrat. 

A: Yeah, ari stocrat. Hi s name was 
Ribbentroph
(ph). Well, I Œ t he Œ some other 
name came back to me, and on the Italian side was Count  
Charnow
(ph). And those 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

people were pushing Œ well, at that  ti me the y were negotiating with Pri me Minister
 
Chamberl ain
. Now, naturally, in those days, when you gave your word, you were 

supposed to keep your word. So 
Hitler
, t hrough 
Chamberlain
, through 
Ribbentro ph
(ph), and Italian 
Charno w
(ph), 
Hitler 
promised the dema Œ the 
demand on the Czechs to give up those border countries, is his last territorial 
demand. 
Chamberlain
 believed it, because in those days, when you signed 
something, you were believing. So he went back to Œ 
Chamberl ain
 went back to 
London
, where he came from, and showed a piece of paper, and thi s piece of paper 
is a guarantee of peace in our lifeti me. Wel l, he didn™t real ize whom he was deali Œ 

dealing with. But coming back to Œ to the Czechs, so there was a certain ani mosity, 

of course, because all  of a sudden, instead of having the country li ke t his, it was like 

Œ 
Q: Sliced. 
A: Œ sliced, and you know, undefensible(ph). 
 
Q: Right. 

A: And in the Œ the Œ t he attitude towards German was all  of a sudden the y were not 

our citizens, the y were our enemies, because they wanted to join 
Germany
. 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
36
 
A: Pri marily because he promised jobs, which we couldn™t deliver at the ti me. So 
now all the European continent really turned pro-German. The Austri ans, the y want 

to be German. The y were German speaking people, but they were so different from 

actually 
Germany
, that it was not  Œ 
you know, 
th-thinki ng about, he promised jobs, 
and he delivered the jobs. Making his armed forces, maki ng all these weapons, 
which he developed. 
Q: But your life, it didn™t change? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: Your life, and your f-family™s ri  Œ  

A: No, not at that t ime, no. We were still playi ng soccer li ke everybody else 

[indecipherable]
 didn™t pla y any role, no. It reall y started much lat er, when he came 

into 
Prague
, which was in March ninethir Œ 
1939. Well 
Œ  
Q: Let™s tal k about that. 

A: Œ 
Czechoslovakia
 ceased to exi st. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And the y no Œ t he y named it the protectorate of 
Bohemia
-
Moravi a
. Had 

something like a Œ what we call the governor, or somethi ng. And the Czechs were 

represented by a figurehead. Then t he list started to change, yes. 

Q: Tell Œ tell us how. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
37
 
A: Anti-Semitism to a certain extent, because they were always connected, the 
Jewish were looked at Œ German speaking people, rather t han Czech speaking 

people. The names were German. So it started to deteriorate. To what extent? Not 

that much, but then started the transportations. 

Q: Well, how did Œ m y question i s much more personal than that. It is, when did 
your life, your father™s life, your mother™s life, how did t hings happen in the family? 
Hitler
 marches in, and by what point Œ 

A: Well, it™s changed primarily because young Czech pe Œ 
young Jewishpeople, th 
Œ we were forced to go on certain labor. We were si
ngle men,that™s w
hy we 

married. The single Jewish peopl e, they were Œ well, they were taught to meet 

somewhere, and that™s was somet hing what I alwa ys call l ike 
Madison Squa re 

Garden
. We don™t  have 
Ma dison Squa re Garden 
in 
Prague Œ 
Q: What was the square? Yeah. 
A: Œ but something like 
Madison Square Garden
. 

Q: What was the pl ace? 

A: We had to Œ we had to report, and we had to do certain work for the Germans. 

Q: Tell me Œ excuse me, though, do you remember the place you had to report to in 

Prague
?

A: Well, it was Œ no, I don™t remember the name, but I have to tel l you, before that 
started, when they marched in, March ™39. 

Q: Correct. 

A: I was 18, I was working for a Jewish firm. The Jewish management was thrown 

out, and a German administrator was sent in. I was still working when he came in, in

A: Œ swastika. And we were Œ the l ocation was just across from the Gestapo 

headquarter. 

Q: Oh, I think I Œ 

A: But the y didn™t, you know, you didn™t do anyt hing, so they didn™t bother you, but 

y
ou s 
Œ you saw t he changes which gradual ly occurred. At  home I don™t think I have 
seen so many changes. Maybe I di dn™t pa y attention to it. I was a young man, they 

still u Œ before 
Hitl er
 came, you know, we still went to dance. And there was a 

resent ment, but there was still freedom enough to go and enjoy Œ don™t forget, I was 
what, 18 years. So what did 18 years do here? The same thing they do over there. 

We went to dance. I remember the place where we used t o go. It was called coffee 

shop, but not the typ e of a coffee shop what we call here a coffee shop. It was much

more elaborate, it was more like a, I would say really full blown rest aurant with a 
dancing Œ 

Q: Place. 

A: Œ room Œ  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ spot where you could dance, and the young people were danci ng, we were 
dancing. But that graduall y has changed, because Œ 

Q: Did your father lose his job? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: Did your father lose his job? 

A: No, I don™t think he lost the job at that point. I think he retired, he was forced to 

retire. So he was home, m y mother was alwa ys home. I don™t know how they were 
making a living, I was Œ but I remember the first salary which I got when I was 
working for that Jewish firm, naturally m y obligation was to bri ng it home. That was 

understood. It was never thought by me tha Œ or by the parents, t hat somehow I 

would take it and spend it somewhere. We were Œ that was ex Œ 
you know,that was 
anticipated and expected from you. Life was very different in those days. But it has 

changed, you know. I l ost that job because ultimately he found out that I was Jewish,

or whatever, and it was 
[indecipherable]
 how could I have worked with somebody 
with a swastika, and all  this stuff. Soon it became Œ  
Q: What was his manner, though? 
Excuse me 
Œ 

A: Œ it became worse. 

Q: Oka y. The manner of that person who ended up taking over the firm, with the 
swast Œ did he Œ was his manner arrogant, was he Œ 
A: No, no Œ well, that was his mentality. But you know, th-the Œ the life has 
changed, what has changed? The laws have changed. So th Œ we were pla ying that 

soccer
. Everybody realize there was no restriction, no nothing. But gradually the 
non-Jewish population was put on such pressure, not to socialize with Jews Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ that all of a sudden your friends, were afraid to be your friends. So, the 
relationship has ceased. Everything became a separate society. The Jewish people 
were Œ we had to wear Jewish stars, we had to be home at eight o™clock. So there 

were certain restrictions which were put on the Jewish population, which became, 

you
 know, like what they call here 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 it di dn™t happen overnight, but 
it was, you know. The first thing, for example, that I remember, as a kid I used t o 

play the violin. Well, don™t ask me what da y, what year, but all of a sudden we were 

supposed to submit all those musi cal instruments to a certain place. Well, but it ™s not 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

that I didn™t agree, you Œ you were afraid not to agree. So you did what you were 
doing, because the Cat holic population, t he y could not help you, because they were 

afraid themselves. So, t h
e 
Œ the Œ the hosti lities, or the vi olence, increased. So that 

there was a distinct difference between the Jewish population, and the non-Jewi sh 

population. And t he very first transport, as I remember, a cousin of mine, he was 
much older than I was
, bu
t that™s not the issue, the only reason I™m sayi ng it, 
because wit h his wife, somehow t he y had no children. She Œ 
she lost achildand she 

couldn™t have more children, or whatever, t hey were one of the first ones to be 

deported to a Polish ghetto which was called 
Lódz
, 
l-o-d-z
, is a town in 
Poland
. 
The y survi ved there until a certain t ime, when that was also liqui dated, and he 

wound up in 
Auschwitz
. Lost his leg in 
Auschwitz
 and everythi ng else, but the y 
came back after the war, and Œ because so few people survived, I was reasonably 
close to them at one point, you know. Remember, the age was different, he was born 
1900, and I was born 1921, so it™s 20 years different. So when w
e came back,I was 

only 22, 24, he was already close t o 50. 

Q: Right. 

A: So there was a different. But eventually they al so left for 
Austria
. 
Austria 
was 
very helpful.

Q: Oka y, let™s go back then, to life gradually changing, and there™s thi s separation 
between the Jews and t he non-Jews, and a marginalization, from what  I™m seeing, 

you™r
e put on the margins of society, where you™re not Œ  
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ allowed to do things that you were all owed to do before. When did Œ let me go 
back even before that. Did you know 
Georgine
 by that ti me? 
A: Yes. 

Q: How did you meet 
Georgine
?  
A: Well, we were kids, we were dancing the same group of people. 

Q: So you were friends from chil Œ  from childhood? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: You were friends from childhood? 
A: Well, not from childhood, but when she was ma ybe 14 - 15, and I was four years 
older, you know. Now, what the Jewish peopl e did, or at l east our group did, there 

was somebody who Œ t he father had the wholesale business, and t he wholesale 

business was in a building which he owned, in the old sect ion of 
Prague
, not far 

from where I was growing up. And the y used to go to that house to dance. But 

remember, i n those days we talk about zilli on years back. 

Q: Not a zil lion. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: Yeah, you had a gramophone, if you remember, and t hat had t o be hooked up, 
and you put the di sk on it, and that™s the music we used to have. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: If you remember ﬁ
Pennies from Heaven
.ﬂ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, that was a Œ 
Q: That was one song Œ 

A: Œ thing which was i n, you know, insp Œ but also, at that time, why did it change? 

Because also Jewish people who spoke German, very littl e Czech Œ 
Czec
h nationals, 
but they were living in those border countries. So when those border countries had 

to be given back to 
Germany
, because sh Œ they came back. So, naturally the y were 
Jewish, and we were Jewish, so somehow there were more of these gi rls, who cam
e 
back from these countries, so we were, all of a sudden, instead of six people, we 
were sa y 12 people or 14 people. And we used to go to dance Œ I don™t remember its 

name, but that™s not i mportant. We went to that house, and in those days you had Œ I 

think 
Georgine
 had it, was an electric gramophone, so you didn™t have to crank it up 

Œ 

Q: Crank it up.

A: Œ you had to pl ug it in, and that  was the music we used to dance to. But that™s Œ 
gradually it  changed. It was very difficult, it was dangerous to go and be found out 

that you do these t hings, which were Œ 

Q: Normal things. 

A: Œ normal things, but  the y not normal under those condi tions. So it has changed, 
you know,  so you know, the deportations started. The deportations didn™t start in 
Auschwitz
, it started in that first ghetto, which the y said will be a model ghetto. 

Q: What was it called? 

A: 
Theresienstadt
. 
Terezin
, in Czech. Now 
Terezin
 was of Œ 
Q: Excuse me, before t hat, when did the deport Œ how di d people find out that 

they™re going to be deported? There™s still a gap between when life stops being 

normal Œ 
A: Well, for example, her fa Œ parents, because the y were 
[indeci phera ble]
 
they had 
a house. S o number one the y had t o move out of their house, their house was given 
to some German famil y, a Œ a lieutenant or whatever he was, you know. So it started 

gradually, you know, it  was not that there were mass transportation, or deportations, 

no. But a l imited amount of people were sent t o 
Terezin
.  

Q: I want t o Œ 
excuse me 
Œ interrupt and finish one thought Œ 

A: Oka y.

Q: Œ before, which was, you and 
Georgine
 are in the same group of friends, and you 
were dancing. How did your relationship develop? How did it develop that you had 
Œ 

A: Well, that Œ I don™t think I remember how it developed, you know. It was the 

sa me group of people that used to go to dance. Now how Œ  
Q: Yes, but fr Œ i Œ but at one point you™re dancing, and then you™re married. What 
happened?  

A: Well, no, no, it was Œ well, no. Used to go t o dance, like I said. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The marriage didn™t happen that  wa y.  

Q: How did it happen? 

A: The marriage happened because all of a sudden the edi ct came Œ don™t hold me to 
the numbers. 
Q: Oka y. 

A:Fivehundred men, 5,000 men, 
we had to report to be deported Œ 
when you were 
single. So everybody who had a girlf
riendgot married. We didn™t get married 
because we thought we would have children in the 
United States
. Wegot married 
because 
we Œ once you were married, you postponed the deportation. Now, under 

those circumstances which existed at that time, everything in your li fe at the time, 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

was to delay the deportation, because you knew where you were, but you did not 
know what  will come once you go. So you did anything t o dela y t he deportation. So 

if you 
Œ if you look at the calendar, you wil l remember that in 1941, when we got 
married, 
Pearl Harbor
 happened.  
Q: That™s ri ght. 
A: So we thought, oh m y gosh, now the 
United States 
will go to war with the Œ it 
will be over before we go. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So everyt hing was done to dela y that thi ng. Now, since you were married all of a 

sudden, whether it was this girlfriend, or t his Œ or vice versa, from the girl™s point of 

view, we got married. Now, of course, the circumstances were very, very different 

already. Number one, we had to wear a Jewish star. Transportation, t here was hardly 
any in place. Now the streetcars, which we had at that Œ remember, we talk about 
1939 - 1940, so different now, no doubt. But at the ti me we had street cars. And t he 

streetcars, the entrance was in the middle. So t here was a front part, and a rear part. 

So the Jewish people had naturally to be in the rear part. 

Q: Of course. 

A: So when we got married, well, we had to go to the rear part, to Œ I don™t know 

where we went. No, I know where we went . Her sister 
[indecipherable]
 you know, 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

the life in 
Prague
 at  that ti me, there Œ there was no different between I told you, 
Jews, non- Jews, people got married. So her sister got marri ed to a Czech person, not 

Jewish person. And they were living in a certain place, I can™t remem ber the street  

any more, but I remember where it was. 

Q: What™s t he neighborhood? 
A: Sorry? 
Q: What was the neighborhood?  

A: It was called 
Li be
, 
l -i-b-e
 and on the end was like a litt le Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ something, li ke that. And sh Œ I don™t know if it was her house, or an 

apartment, I don™t remember that, but I know it  was supposed to Œ that™s where we 

had our quote, wedding celebration, if you want to call it. But all  this was in a very, 
very li mited wa y. 
Q: Of course. 

A: Because the circum stances were not to allow you to do something 

ostentiously
(ph) or something Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ no. But we got married in October 1941, and like I just told you, because so 

many young men were supposedt oreport 
Œ let ™s call it to 
Madison Square Garden

for work. Now once you were marri ed, you sti ll reported, but you were not deport ed. 
Now the deportation were already taking place. Now, if I ma y inject something Œ  

Q: Sure. 

A: Œ what I was doing when I quote lost m y accounting j ob? You had to work. If 

you didn™t work, you didn™t get your stamps, which you needed t o buy food, so we 
had to work. So natural l y you had no choi ce what you would like to do for work. 
You were t old what to do. Now, you have to realize that some of these Jewish 

people, incl uding her father, mother, when they were deported, the y left behind this, 

let™s sa y. So that had to be emptied, because the landlord wanted to rent it. so he 

couldn™t rent it when al l the stuff was there. So I was assigned to a uni t which was 

emptying outsewi ng machines. 
[ho rn sound] 
My ear?
 
Q: No. 
A: Oh, thi s were Œ 
Q: It™s a car outside. 

A: The Œ the sewing machines in those da ys were heavy clunkers. I don™t know if 

you remember that, they were, you know, big stuff. Iron. Not like now plastic, and 

you put it on the table 

Q:Yeah, yeah, yeah.

A: So mirrors, pictures and s
ewing machines werea 
Œ were taken out of those 
apartment and they were stored in a large synagogue in a suburb of 
Prague
. I was in 
that unit which was doi ng this Œ 

Q: Work.
 

A: Œ work. Now, since we had pict ures from t he Jewish family Œ at that ti me, if you 
remember, ma ybe you don™t remember, because your age, west 
E urope 
was already 
under the attack by Brit ish, maybe American planes. So some of these planes hit 

German households. So the German government gave these burned-out families, 

something what we have here, what we call food stamps. Now, they were not having 

food stamps, but t hey had stamps to buy certai n things, to reestablish them in 

Prague
, or wherever they were living. Now, let™s shall Œ talk about 
Prague
, because 

that™s where I was active. So when the y came, and they had these stamps, coupons, 
or whatever it was, t hat  they could buy two pai ntings. Now, naturally the y didn™t 
pay for it, t he y gave you that stamps in return. But there was no gallery, l ike here i n 

a gallery, you know, you Œ that was a pile of paintings, t hat it was segregated 

between certain items of paintings; ani mals, or flowers, or whatever. The y Œ in 

German the y call it 
stil  leben
.  
Q: 
Stil leben
, yeah.

A: So, I remember that when these people came in, they wanted to have a 
stil le
ben
 
for their dining room, so I had to hold it, because the y wanted to look at it. So when 
I was holdi ng it, you know, that™s how you hold 
stil Œ 
why do I menti on it? So when 

we got married, in October 1941, and I was st ill working for that Jewish 

organization, assembling the sewi ng machine, pictures, and all that stuff. So when 
we had to report to, quote, 
Madison Square Garden
, t here was nat urally an 
SS
 
g uy 
who directed the Œ the people, the traffic where you had t o check i n, where you had 
to go. Somehow he remembered t hat he was buying Œ buying a painting that Œ which 
I was holdi ng. So, h-he called me out from the deportation, and he sai d, you sta y 

here. So naturally t hen Œ remember, I spoke perfectly German, I had German 

schools, and then you Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ i mprove it, because everything was German. So I was telling hi m that I have 
also a wife here. So somehow we found where 
Georgine
 was, and the delay, agai n, 

everything was alwa ys dela y, delay, dela y.  

Q: What about your parents? Were t he y Œ 

A: My parents, the y sta Œ that was a difference, I Œ 

Q: We™ll come to that. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: Œ I™ll tell you. So, we were delayed, not by a long time, no, but it was a dela y
. 
Week, or something, whatever. You talk about  m y parents. My si ster worked for the 
Jewish government , the government which was connected to the German 

government . Don™t forget, the Germans di dn™t do any orders, they gave the orders to 

the Jewish government . So there was a Jewish police, there was a Jewish this Œ 
everything Œ not everyt hing, of course, but  within certain Œ so my sist er was working 
for that Jewish organization, call it  the Jewish government . And t hat was pri mari ly 

because, if you remem ber I told you, that person who came into our house where we 

were living. So he knew m y mot her, he knew my sister Œ 

Q: This 
Edelstein
(ph)?  

A: 
Edelstein
(ph). So he was delayi ng their deportation. So the y sta yed 

[indecipherable]
 in 
Prague
 much longer than I and 
Georgine
, or her parents.  
Q: Got it. 

A: How long 
[indecipherable]
 how long, but  you know, eventually t hey also 
came 

to 
Theresienstadt
, just  like m y si ster. But sh Œ m y sister, from the job in 
Prague
, 
she had the same job in 
Theresienstadt
, because 
Œ  
Q: What was that j ob? 

A: Œ she was working for the Jewish government.

A: The office. 
Q: Office work. 

A: You know, don™t forget the y had Œ the y had statistics, the y knew how many 

people the y killed. I tell you the y knew exactl y how the y killed. They had system, 

and if you read back, you know, t he papers what I have here Œ I wi ll have to look for 
it to show it to you, tru Œ they knew m y transportation number when I was, well, 
with 
Georgine
, when we left 
Prague
 for 
Theresienstadt
, the Œ t he t ransport had a 

name, the transport had a number. We had a number. I don™t remember the number, 

of course, but I have papers here to show you. So, my parents were actually deported 

later. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y Œ t he y perished, of course, just li ke everybody perished. But  the y Œ 
later th 
Œ the y lived a little longer, let™s sa y, before they got into 
Auschwitz
, and 
Auschwitz
 
was, of course, the end of it. B
ecause you, when youwere in 
Auschwitz
, and you 
came with a train, and in front of you stood that doctor, whatever his name was. And 

he decided as you go this wa y, or t hat wa y. Natch Œ now, you have to realize, I like 

to tell you, we know now when we sa y the word 
Auschwitz
, we know what it is. 

But you have to go back to 1941, when we got  married, ™42. So when we were living 

in 
Theresienstadt
, our clothes Œ they didn™t have any prisoner clot hes
 Œ 
it was 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

horrible. But it was a paradise compared to what happened. Why do I sa y it? 
Because, you know 
Theresienstadt
 is an old t own, named after Queen 

Theresienstadt
, or what
ever
 she was 
[indeci pherable]
 
Q: 
Theresa
, mm
-
hm.
 
A: And nat urally, those were barracks for the Czech armed forces. Now there wasn™t 
that much space, nor that many beds or anyt hi ng. So they constructed bunks, three 
on top of each other. So that was a terrible shortage of space. When you went t o the 

bathroom, you had to have your container for soap, you went there, you know. It 

was not a bathroom in a sense, like you go here. So, it was very difficult. The 

crowds. You had t o wait in line to get your food, you know. So when you come 

from a normal atmosphere like here Œ 
andIdon™t mean my houseper se 
Œ  
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Œ and then all of a sudden you have a regi mented life, you have t o be there seven 
o™clock, or nine o™cl ock, or whatever. And then you slept  three on top of each other, 

which one are you going to go? On top, in the mi ddle, or down below? So there 

were argu ments among people, Jewish people, but don™t forget, t he y were not only 

Jewish people there Œ 

Q: Of course. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

A: Œ there are also Jewi sh people from some ot her places, because it  was supposed 
to be a model ghett o, and hit Œ 
and
 
Hitler
 was running the border over. So it became 

extremely crowded. Now, in that 
Theresienstadt
, the first 
x
 months, I can™t tell you 
how many months, but I was assigned to distribute coal, because I was w
orking in 

the coal firm, so I was assigned to a coal j ob. What was t he job? 
Well,
 all these 
people who were living in these places, the y were assigned boxes, with the two 

handles here, two handles over there, and t hat you had to fill this Œ this up with coal, 

and the y took it in wherever they were stayi ng. The houses were condr Œ houses Œ 

th-the y were n-not houses like Œ 

Q: Barracks. 

A: Œ you know, when Œ shacks. But that was converted so that some people could 

have Œ like there is mostly men, or mostly women, and the y needed heat, so they 
were getting the coal . So, at one point, the Œ you know, when Œ when the coal 
normally was sold, or delivered, there used t o be a little hut with a scale outside. So, 

because of my coal co- connections, I was given the use of that thi ng. So 
Georgi ne
 

moved back in with me, in that Œ 

Q: Hut. 

A: Œ hut, t he y call it. In the Œ in the public

Q: Hang on. Before we get there Œ 

A: Sure, sure. 

Q: Œ ther Œ because there is some gaps here. The last we knew, is that  the 
SS
 officer 
pulls you out of line, and Œ and you have a delay. 

A:Couple da ys more.

A: Oh yes.

A: Œ we were deport ed by train.  
Q: Oka y. 
A: Now, I don™t Œ I do n™t remember where it was, you know, certain things 

disappear from your memory, you know. 

Q: That™s oka y. That™s oka y. 

A: Don™t forget that what you™re tal king about, happened 70-odd years ago. 

Q: I know. I know. I know. It™s amazing what you™re able t o tell us from that time. 

A: Oh, I remember t hese things li ke if it happened yesterda y, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Certain things. 

Q: Certain things. 

A: And certain things you don™t remember. 

Q: So, here™s another question before we go back to 
Theresienstadt
. Life changed 

after 
Hitler
 marched i n. 

A: Yes.

Q: And that was in March 1939. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: And then the war st arts September ™39. 

A: That was because 
H itler 
didn™t keep his word that the Czech territ ory was hi s last 

territorial Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ demand. He had a demand on 
Poland
. 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: And he marched into 
Poland
 on September 1
st
 Œ 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Œ 1939.  

Q: My question: did life change even more when there was an actual war? 
A: Yeah, of course, of course, of course. 
Q: How?  

A: Well, ha Œ 
agai
n, we 
had to be home by eight o™clock,  you couldn™t do out, you 
couldn™t do this. There were restrictions. 

Q: So was like a Œ okay. 

A: Musical instruments we had to give up. The star, and you know, that all 

happened. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: But, is that because of the war, or is that Œ 
A: That Œ that happened between t hem marchi ng in. When the y marched in, nothing 

happened. You were li ving like you were living before. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But s-slice. 
Q: Slice, okay. 
A: Slice this, you know, then that Œ that they Œ look, we used to go to pla y cards 
with that friend of mine, who was, of course, Catholic. He was m y Œ playing soccer, 

I was the ri ght wing, he was playing next t o me, whatever we used to call it. So we 

were friends. So we used to go to Œ they were living very close to where I was 

living, when we talk about park. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So, in the evening, whatever during the day, he was working, I was working. So 
during the evening, we went to see, in his home, such an old house, I remember like 

today. And we were pl ayi ng cards, you know, killing the evening. There was no 

television, of course, you know, in those da ys. So we pla yed cards. The mother 

divorced Œ 
his mother. And me 
Œ and wa Œ she was dating somebody who was 
German. But he was very Œ you know, not every German was a Nazi at that point. 
Q: Of course, of course. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: But, the y deteriorated. Then it came that we could not sta y longer t han eight 
o™clock, we had to be home. So we had to go from his house to m y house, to go 

home, because you didn™t like to take a chance if somebody would catch you on the 

street. So it gradual ly became worse and worse and worse, you know? And then, all 

of a sudden, you couldn™t see hi m any more, because he was afraid if he was Œ if 
somebody will see hi m with a Jew Œ 
Q: He gets into trouble. 

A: Œ that he will have a problem. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But tal king about the German language and all that, 
Auschwitz
, youknow, when 
I was comparing it to that here, 9/11, when we had that 
World Trade Center
 
coming down, I know where I was, I™m sure you know where you were. 
Q: Y
eah.
 
A: And I saw the first plane hitting the thi ng. Wel l, at that ti me m y assumption was 
that the guy lost his bearing, or something happened to t he plane, and he hit the 

building. So the same was with 
Auschwitz
, youknow, when you 
Œ 
when you don™t 
know, and you are confronted with these unknown things, what happened? So, 

coming back to 
Theresienstadt
, t he y got  there in March ™43. And from March ™43 

to September ™44, everyt hing was 
Theresienstadt
, oka y?

Q: Living under Œ oka y? 

A: My name, prag Œ 
Pekarek
.  

Q: Oka y. 
A: And I was working for the Jewish government, removing Œ 
Q: Stuff from the houses. 

A: Œ but it didn™t happen right awa y, I was still working under the German guy. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then, when I lost that job, if you want to call it, then Œ then they assigned me 

to this thi ng, and t hen I was assembling t he sewing machines, paintings, mirrors. 

Q: Things like that . 
A: And then, in f Œ March ™43, well, we had to go. 
Q: Oka y. Oka y, so in 
Ther

, you™re t here from March four Œ 
A: Nine Œ March ™43 Œ 

Q: Forty-three. 

A: Œ to September ™44. What happened September ™44? September 28 is a Czech 

holida y. So we were told that we have to build a new camp, alwa ys the new camp. I

don™t Œ I can™t Œ what I don™t know, I™ll tell you. I don™t remember if it was 500, or 
5,000 Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ or anyt hing i n bet ween, men. So, we were assembled, and we had to Œ we had 

to go to these open boxcars, which were full of coal that had to be taken out, the 
coal, and we had to go in. Then the y took off March Œ 
September 28
, eastward. 
Now, we knew that  the American al lied sol diers were coming westward, but the y 

didn™t get far enough for us to get out, whatever. So when the trai n was full of 

people, open boxcars, well, you know what people do, you know. People have to go 

to the bathroom, there i s no food. I have to int erject here something, because m y 

friend out on 
Long Island
, he alwa ys says, well, what about food? And I always tell 
hi m, 
Fernando
, t here were no dining cars, you know. But there™s something el se. So 
after we were traveling east Œ nort heast, there was somebody, as I remember it l ike 

today, in a stripe Œ remember, 
Theresienstadt
, we had our clothes. So that was also, 
you know, where you put it, and al l that st uff. So there was alwa ys a shortage of 

space, and you intermi ngled stuff, and it wa Œ  it was really a source of trouble. But 

when we were traveling east, there was a guy in str-striped uniform. And we get out 

of those boxcars, where are you from? Because we wanted to know what camp is he 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

from. And he said 
Auschwitz
. Now that didn™t Œ that™s like if you would sa y 
something. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Didn™t mean a t hing. Well, we continued traveling for I don™t know how many 

days. And finally we got in to something which we Œ was called 
Auschwitz
. But 
you know, again, t he Germans, what the y did, the y tried t o inti midate you right from 

the first moment you entered this whole area. The train di dn™t s-stop, yes, but not 

that everybody had to get out of the train. It  took, I think, two da ys before they 

finall y set everybody out of those boxcars, and get out. And the train was going 

around, around, and you had no idea, because there were no signs. You didn™t know 

how Œ where Œ how come that we go around. Nobody was there t o tell you anything, 

of course. So finally when we came to a st op, which was like, I woul d sa y, the 
couple of days after, October first, second, I don™t know for sure. Well, we to get 
out, you know, orders in German. And m y Œ we were toget her, her father, the two 

uncles, the t wo doctors, and also some other relatives from her mother™s side. 

Q: Were you toge Œ was 
Georgine
 
with you?
 
A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Her father-in-
law. Wasonly men.
 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: Oka y. 
A: So, well, we had to get out, and then you were confronted by that t op German 

guy who was Œ 
welcoming you,
 whatever. And he Œ m y father-in-law, he was sa yi ng 

that he™s a Œ  he was not  old, but in his mind, he was old. He was only 50 years, fif Œ 

exactly 50 years, but you know, he lost his house, he lost  his business, and 
everything else. So he felt he™s old. So he was telling hi m in German that he™s an old 
man. So he had to go t his wa y. Well, the t wo brothers, the doctors, me and someone, 

this way. Well, once you are split, you try to find out what happened to the people 

who are the other wa y. 

Q: The other place. 

A: Well
, they to Œ t he y told you here is gas chambers, crematoriums, and the only 

way out of here is through the chimne y, you know. So, if you find out what 
happened to hi m, and well, 
then we
 were i n 
Auschwitz
. First the shoes had to be 
disinfected, so the y put it into water. Well, this was inti midation, you know? So now 
you had shoes wet, ic y cold. 
Auschwitz
 is in a very cold area of southern 
Poland
, 
standing in those freezi ng temperat ures, wet shoes, no coats, no nothi ng. The y gi ve 

you pants, but those pants are like, you know, his pants were, if he Œ I don™t mean 

your pants what you have on, but me that woul d be obviously, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

A: But then you were assigned to a barrack. Those were stables for the Polish armed 
forces horses. Don™t forget the ti me is stil l horses. So, if you had to have equipment, 

horses had to pull it, not a car. Gasoline was very difficult. So the Œ t he Œ the Œ t he 

stables the y had, seven floors, of course. And t hey were 
contructions
(ph) for the 
horses, but  
contructions
(ph). The size was just about li ke the table. Not high, I 
don™t mean that, the s Œ the size. And that was on the floor, and the edges were a 
little higher. So think of it as on the floor, but t he end was a little higher. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Why was the end hi gher? Because the people had to put o-oat s into that 

contraption, so the oats were not all  over. 

Q: Right. 

A: Then the horses ate the oats, or whatever el se the y were eating. Now for us, the 
height was good because we put our head on i t. There were no beds, like at 
Theresienstadt
 we had bed Œ we had beds, we had bunks, but that was still Œ 

Q: It™s still  a space, yeah. 

A: Œ regular Œ you know. So that was Œ 
th
-that  stuff on the floor, cold as it was, you 
know. It was awful, awful. So one of Œ 

Q: When di d you find out Œ 

A: Œ the uncles Œ 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ of 
Georgine
, doctor.
 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He said, we don™t st ay here. Well, that™s easier said than done.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Naturally. So he was Œ he came up with this story that  if they do nothing, the y 
will not survive, because the cold weather, the food, no food, nothing. So he sai d 

that the best will be for us to sa y t hat we are locksmiths. And I alwa ys say that™s t he 

only lie I li ed in my life, because I said I™m a locksmith. So 
we s 
Œ but he figured 
that if we sa y we would be locksmiths, t hat they would send us into some kind of a 

factory, and it would be inside, rather than somewhere outside, digging roads, or 

something. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Well, he was right. The y were al wa ys Œ they were alwa ys counting how many are 

alive, and all that stuff, in 
Auschwitz
. 

Q: When di d Œ where Œ again, I™ll go back a lit tle bit. In 
Theresienstadt
, what was 
the mortality like? Weretherealot ofpeople who 
Œ  
A: I re Œ don™t know. 

Q:I mean, did 
you see people dying Œ 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
67
 
A: Of Œ of course, old people, we used, of course 
[indeci pherable]
. Of
 course, the 
old people were dyi ng, but the y were buried. 
Q: I see. 

A: Sure. And I think they started with 
Auschwitz
 from 
Theresienstadt
, because I 

think really the Germans were concerned that ma ybe some disease, or some upri sing 
might happen, you know, over the multitude of people, you know, and now, of 
course, they had th Œ 
they hadthe weapons,
 we had nothi ng, of course.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: But the y woul d have to shoot.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: All that  blood, and all that mess which would probably happen. So they started 

with the deportation out of 
Theresienstadt
, you know? I think that was the main 
reason, apart from getti ng rid of the Jewish population. 
Q: And you didn™t  know wher
e 
Georgine
 was? 

A: Sorry? 

Q: At Œ at that time, you didn™t Œ 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: Œ you didn™t know where 
Georgine
 Œ  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
68
 
A: We left 
Georgine
 and her mother behi nd. The y followed, because that Œ the 
excuse was, you want to follow your husbands, your brot hers, you can go tomorrow. 

So three days later, she went with her mot her, the same wa y. Of course, she never 

saw her mother again, because agai n, the age, you know. But 
G eorgi ne
 was shi pped 

to a Russian camp from 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Where was she shipped? 

A: She was called Œ it was called 
Gross-R osen
. 
Q: Ah, to 
Gross- Rosen
, oka y, mm-
hm.
 
A: That™s where she stayed until t he end of the war. But she was always sick, you 

know, women are very different, in case you don™t know. The women body is a very 

different body than a man™s body, so she Œ she came back, she was si ck from da y 

one. Of course, she came back to 
Prague
, where I was, you know, first thing 
hospital. She had t o be put back into a normal stage, which she wasn™t.  

Q: So Œ 

A: But 
Auschwitz
, you know, then we were locksmiths. 

Q: Yeah, locksmiths. 

A: You remember, m y name was 
Pekarek
? 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
69
 
A: So, at one ti me, we had to, agai n, assemble to go Œ there was no travel agent, you 
know, the y told you have to get out of the thing, and you were standi ng there, then 

they told you will be transported someplace, so the tr Œ the y call t he names. Now, 

lots of people changed their names, not legally. Why? Because the y were afraid in 

case the y would be punished or beaten up, or whatever. They might have 
ramification to the famil y som
ewhere else.
 
Q: Right. 
A: So, lots of young men changed t he name from 
A
 to 
B
, or 
B
 t o 
C
. I didn™t change 
mine, I was still 
Pekarek
. And Œ but the Œ the transportation, the first transportation 
stopped at 
K
, and because I was 
Pekarek
, they were 
F
, 
Feldmans 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ they left, and I stayed behind. Because there were only so many empty on the 
train Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ to go wherever. So, we met only after the war with t hose peopl e again. The y 

survived, and I survived, as a locksmith, but not in the same place. Reasonably, you 

would sa y like I was in 
Muncie
, and they were in 
Poborno
(ph), or something l ike 
that. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
70
 
A: Of course, you couldn™t travel freely, that was out of question. B ut I cus Œ I 
stayed behi nd, unfortunately, and because I st ayed behind, you al ways have to do 

something what the y told you to do. So for maybe about a month, or six weeks or so, 

I had to Œ I was assigned to a group which was taking out  the dead bodies from the 

gas chambers, which had to be taken to the crematorium. You di dn™t like to leave 
dead bodies in the gas chambers, you had to go to the crematorium and burn them. 
And then, you know, th-the ashes was nothing. So the Œ t he transportation took place 

on a Œ I don™t know how you would call i t, it had two 
Vs 
on each side, and a piece of 

wood was like this, you know? We were not so strong, I can™t tell  you how many we 

had to push alwa ys to get to the gas chambers. Take the bodies out , put them on t hat 

stretcher 
[indecipherable]
 and transport them to the crematorium. Well, that went 

on for some time, I would say maybe about a couple of Œ ma ybe about a month or 
so. 
Q: Wasn™t i t a shock? 

A: Well, sweetheart, that was life at that time. Then Œ then he finished, and the 

transportati ons then again, was through that Œ where I was,  as a locksmith. If you 
have a huge map of 
Germany
, you probably found town one in Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
71
 
A: Œ on the map. It was called 
Meuselwitz
. Very close to where Uncle 
Bert
 was 
with his brother, but not in 
Mosul
, it™s a very different place. And you were working 
there from six to six. 
Q: And what did you do there?  

A: What I did after that ? 
Q: No, no, no, in 
Meuselwitz
. 
A: What I was doing Œ it was a huge machine. We were producing casings for the 
German navy. You had a machine you p-put Œ remember, I was a locksmith, so you 

pressed it, t he thing was about thi s big Œ not that Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ you know, ma ybe bigger, but narrower. And you had a bucket, and that Œ 
you 
had to fill up the bucket. I can™t tell  you how many buckets a day, or whatever, from 
six to six. Well, then you went back to where you were supposed to be housed, but it 
was temporary shelter, really. Was no bed. Was just one t hing bi g from there to 

hear, and toda y you slept here, tomorrow you slept there. Boys or old men only. And 

in the morning you did the same thing. Si x to six. And I have to tell you how I got 

out, because really t hat  was what people al ways sa y, well, who Œ who Œ who 

liberated you
. And I have to sa y, I was not  liberated in that sense. Remember what I 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

was telling you is the truth. The only not truth is locksmi th. So, w-
we came back, 
wha-whatever the dat e was. 
April 7.
 
Q: You came back t o where?  

A: To Œ where we were sleeping. 

Q: Ah, so in 
Meuselwitz
, you™re st ill Œ 
A: From t he factory Œ 
Q: To the place. 

A: Œ they took us back to where we were sleeping. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But instead of sleepi ng, we had to empty a t ray of briquettes. You know what  

briquettes are? Briquettes are about this big. So we had to empty that tray from the 

briquettes. Well, then Œ  then that 
[indecipherable]
 the tab les, and they threw the 
briquettes, they chased us in. So again, you know, you are in a train, l ike m y friend 

alwa ys, what about food, what about food? First of all, we were already dehydrat ed, 

the body was stopped, l ike you sitting here Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ or I™m sitting here. I don™t know how many pounds we had, but food was not 

really the item which bothered you, so to speak. So then she starts back into the

train, and the train t ook off east, just like from 
Theresienstadt
 east, this ti me from 
Meuselwitz
, 
German
y
, east. Awa y from those upcoming American soldiers. 
Q: One poi nt here, I just want to establish. So, if I understand properly, you were in 
Auschwitz
 for about two months or so? 

A: No, I was there l onger than that. I got to Œ i n 
Auschwitz
 in September 28, so we 
got there li ke, I would say, October first. 
Q: Right. 

A: And out of 
Auschwitz
, somewhere around Christmasti me. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: So I would sa y about three months. 

Q: Three months. Three months. 

A: And then from Christmas to the quote, liberation where I™m trying to tell you Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ in 
Meuselwitz
. 

Q: In 
Meuselwitz
, okay. 

A: Now the 
Meuselwitz
 didn™t have any accommodation, like I j ust said Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ it was Œ you know why? Because the German people, they were very all Œ 

either on the east front, or west front, and t he y needed the manpower, so the y were 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

interested i n producing it. Anywa y, so when t he order came to get inside those 
boxcars east  Œ but you have to reali ze, that was not 
Germany
 of the 1940s, that was 
Germany
 of a defeated country. The railroads were ripped up from the bombing of 
the 
United States
. So the transport ation wasn™t like that you hop in here and you 

wind up there, no. It was very difficult. Not for u Œ I mean, we were just prisoners, 
and we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So 
we were traveling for t wo da ys, eastward. Then we came to a place in 
Germany
, or 
ma ybe western 
Pol and
, or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers. 
The y were heading west, we were heading east. It™s like that, oka y. I was like this, 

they were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were t old to get out of the 

boxcar so that they could count how we are sti ll in the boxcar are livi ng, because 

some peopl e are die out of hydrati on, age, mal nutrition, sickness. So t hey alwa ys 
counting. So while we were standi ng alongside our railroad car, next to us was a 
German car, right? I mean, the Bri tish bombers came by, and the y started to dive, 

and started t o shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and yo u starting to 

shoot, you don™t shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as 

many opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that  
moment.  We
 were out of 
the car. So, we Œ wi  Œ wi 
[indeci pherable]
 if you want t o call it free. That™s not the 
right word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call  it 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
75
 
the same li ke here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the 
hill, because you wanted to get awa y from the shooting. So we were Œ 
reme
mber, I 
was Œ 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you 

would have now that I™m 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was 

always somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don™t 
remember the other t wo who were running, Czechs, with us. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we got up on top of the hill. Now we were realizing t hat we didn™t have any 

German guard watching us, right? We were free. Free, without any passport, wi thout 

any papers, striped uniform.S
o free is a different thing for free. And that Œ and the 
train, which I told you, the British bombers started to bomb. Eventuall y t he y hit the 

train. So there was a tremendous commoti on. But we wound up on the top of the 
hill. So that Œ what are we going to do? Are we going to sta y here, get organized, or 
going back, or whatever. So we decided four of us, cold as it was, that we will stay 

overnight, and then we will think what we do t he nec Œ 
nextda y. So wedecided one 

day to sta y up on t he hi ll, and ma ybe two nights, I don™t remember for sure any 

more. But we decided t o go back, because we thought, we had no papers, we had 

nothing. Where are we going to go? Not that we had anywhere to go down there, but

Q: Right. 
A: Œ where we were. So we went down the hill, and as we were comi ng down the 

hill, believe it or not, our train took off. So we Œ we really lost the trai n. The 

prisoners who were stil l there. 
We t
ook only about one car, which was where we 
were. The rest was still inside. So, we left the t rain Œ so we, when we saw the trai n 
moving, we ducked a li ttle, to be sure that t he y don™t start shooti ng. And the y left, 
and we went back to the hill. So we were on that hill 
[indecipherabl e]
 
Ferna ndo
 
will buy the food. I sai d, oh
 
Ferna ndo
, there was no food, there was no service, 
that™s for sure. But anyhow, we went back to the hill, and we sta yed there another 

two da ys. 

Q: No food, nothi ng, yeah? 

A: Thinking where to go, how to go, what  excuse. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, the roads 
were al
l occupied by what we have here, Nat ional Guard, or 

what do we call it here? 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

A: So we knew once we get down, that we will be confronted. The onl y t hing, 
we 

spoke very well German, and we came up wit h a story that we wi ll say we were

Czech workers on t he t rain, apart from prisoners from 
Auschwitz
. So, we were 
different. We thought we are different from Œ 

Q: Those. 

A: Œ and that our papers, in that commoti on, we lost our stuff which we had, and that 

would have shown that we are Czech workers. So finally we deci ded we take a 
chance, we have to do it, because we 
don™t liv
e indefinitely on top of the hill. So we 
went down, a short  enough distance, like you would say, maybe further down, 
ma ybe 
[indeciphera bl e]
. Sure enough, there was a station, this we Œ soldiers with Œ 
three, four soldiers wit h guns. So we put  our hands up ri ght awa y, that the y don™t 

start shooti ng. That™s the approach, then w- we told them exactly what I™m telling 

you, that we were Czech workers, on work in 
Germany
, in that factory where we 
were, and that our clot hes was damaged in that attack, and that™s what we saved, is 
what we have on
. Well,
 you have Œ you have to put you into jail, you have to see t he 
magistrate t he next da y. So we were now i n Œ i n a regular jail. Well, if you have a 
brain injury Œ and I hope not 
[indecipherable]
 but it was the first ti me a regular jai l. 

There was discarded cl othes. So, what we did, we took, i nstead of our prison 

clothes, we took the discarded clothes which was left there by whoever. So when 

this local magistrat e, the next morning, we had ill-fitted clothes, but it was not Œ 

Q: Striped. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

A: Œ striped. The story was that we are Czech workers, that we were Œ of course, we 
spoke German, that we were caught on the trai n, which was bombed by the British 

and we got Œ you know, we were trying to get somewhere, out of, you know, where 

we were. Now, the most unexpected thing happen. The magistrate said that, you 

suffered enough, You are free to go wherever you want to go. 
Q: So he didn™t believe your story? 
A: Well 
Œ well, he l et us go. So we were free. So then, coming back t o 
Prague
, how 
do you get back? 

Q: Well, did you t hen have a paper, or a stamp, or something. 

A: No, we had not hing.  

Q: So you could have been stopped the next town over? 

A: Yes, well, we were not stopped, you know, the situation was like here after 9/11. 
You know, it was not Œ it was not so rigid any more, you know. 
Q: It was chaotic. 

A: I-It was halted, 
you know.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Now, I would like t o also tell you at this point that the cars which existed, which 

were allowed to travel, didn™t use gasoline. What the y di d Œ the Germans are very 

inventive. The 
Œ the cars which were allowed to take what  I am telling you, the y had

to cut out t he passenger seat. The driver, was a driver, but the passenger seat was 
taken out, and the y put in something like you would say, a contraption, with wooden 

chips. And the wooden chips had t o be put on fire, and the y produce a little bit of  

steam, and t he steam produce the car to go. So when we tried to get to 
Prague
 hi Œ 
not hijacking, ja Œ 
j ack 
Œ how you call it here, when you Œ  
Q: Hitchhiking. 

A: Œ hitchhi Œ hitchhiki ng. So we tried to get t o 
Prague
 hitchhiki ng, because we 

have, of course, no money, no paper, no nothing, four of us. So, a truck, wh
ich was 

something I remember like toda y, like a pickup truck, he stopped. Where do you 

want to go? Of course we said 
Prague
, and he said he goes to 
Prague
, too, but his 

truck Œ where we were was a very hilly country. So he said, most likel y t he truck 

will not make it, you will have to get out, and have to push the thing to get over t he 
Œ 
Q: Hill. 

A: So we took seven days to get back to 
Pra gue
, because he had onl y t hat thing on 
the side, producing the Œ the s Œ the steam. But  we got to 
Prague
 Apri l 20

Q: You hadn't eat anyt hing for 13 da ys? 
A: Who should have given me some? So she gave us Œ I remember li ke toda y, tea. 
Well, I said 
[indeci phera ble]
 something else. And shower, bathroom, be
cause we 
had lice. If you know what lice does, you know, they crawl all over you. So, 

naturally she was afraid that we bring the lice into her home. So first was the 

bathroom, you know, stayi ng there because how many hours, to kill t he lice. And 

then a cup of tea. But you couldn™t  get out of 
thathouse, because we didn™thave any 

papers, so we were afraid if you get Œ we Œ I was afraid, if you get out, you know, 
that somebody could st op us. And then what? Don™t forget the hair Œ th-the hair, you 
know. But  during the camp, the y shore it, so people knew that you are from 

somewhere else. So we stayed insi de until  May fi ve. And quote famous Czech 

revolution started May five.Ended
 Ma y ni ne, was horrible. Because people take 

vendettas, you know. Because you did this to m y family, I did this to you, you

A: People, you know, people found out where the Germans were hi di ng, and they 
killed them, of course. But if they would have killed them with one shot, is one 

thing, but that was not t he case, it was awful. Those are the unfortunate results of 

war, you know? The people who depress people, you know, that comes out. But 

then, April Œ Ma y nine, it stopped. The nat ion came back to order. There was poli ce, 
real police, you know. So gradually things get  to order, and I Œ and I have to agai n 
say the French, they were having all kinds of ways  to reunite families. Don™t forget, 

youdidn™t know where

signs that you™re looki ng for somebody last seen in this camp, in September, or 

something, you know, t hat he should report to this and this address, and stuff like 

that. So it took a l ittle while to get it back int o order. But those who survived, well, 

they had some arrangements, you know, like I told you about these two doctors. 

The y all were supposed to meet i n her sister™s house, and they di d, one at a ti me.

Q: Wow.
 

A: There™s not much else I can add to it.  

Q: There are more questions, but Œ  
A: Somehow Œ I don™t know how I got the apartment, whether it was given to me, 
whether I could occupy it without  a lease, or whatever, I don™t remember. I had an 

apartment t he old secti on of 
Prague
, new buil ding. No el evator, but it was on the 

second floor. I don™t remember whether I Œ I don™t know how I maint ained it, I 

didn™t have any mone y. But eventually I got the job, you know, t he one Œ the one 

Jewish friend, one of them came back. Natural ly, demanded his firm to be getting 

back. And eventually I started to w ork for hi m.

most unusual kind of way of being liberated. 
A: Oh yeah, when I left, yes, yes. 

Q: You know? 
A: This how it was. 
Q: And you were at  your sister™s Œ your sister™s house, or your cousin™s house who

Prague

A: No, she was living i n 
Lieben

years since you™re out of there, you know. 

Q: Of course. So, was i t in a residential nei ghborhood, or was it a city 
neighborhood? 
A: No, that was a residential neighborhood, yes. 

Q: A city neighborhood, or Œ  

A: Yeah, it was very nice, and again, you know, when Œ when these deportations 

started, you always sai d well, you have to be somewhere, then you come back. 

Nobody ever thought that you wil l not come back. 

Q: Come back. 
A:So yes, you 
Œ you will come back, and you should have someplace where you 
will quote, meet. 
Q: And 
Vlasta
(ph), was she able to sta y t here because she was married to a non-

Jew?  

A: She was married to a non-Jew, but that actually it was a surprise t hat she 

somehow managed not  to be involved, because that was not an excuse. She was 

Jewish, so under normal circumstances of that time, she would have had the same

difficulties. But for some strange reason, nobody knew. The neighbors, of course, 
Czech. She married somebody by the name of 
Krejcik
(ph). 

Q: 
Krejcik
(ph). 

A: Now 
Krejcik
(ph) is like a small tailor, in English. So the name was, of course, 
Czech, and she was married to hi m for quite a while. Well, they woul d have been ol-
older than we, but I remember hi m, and she came here couple of times, we have a 
picture, we ha

short cut Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ you know, and Œ and the language, you hear the same voice, and yes. So I had 
no problem with t hat part, no. And specially the bathroom. Now, you know, these 
are human, so when you go to the bathroom, you know what happen. You have to 

clean yourself, and Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ wash up yourself. There™s something whi ch didn™t exist in 
Australia Œ
 ah, i n 
Australia
, in Œ in Œ in 
Auschwitz
. There were no bathrooms, you know, there was a 
piece of wood, and you had to sit down and do what you did, and there was no 
water. So you really Œ you personal esteem, or hygiene, or whatever you want t o call 
it, was absolutely nonexistent, you know. Just think of it, what she was talking 

about, that underwear. Wel l you, when you are in that ki nd of a cold weather, and 

you are not properly dressed, your nose is running con-constantly. So, at one time 

they were, probably 
as a
 make you feel miserable, or whatever, out of that prayer 
shawl, the y made short s. So Œ which I started t o tell you earlier. Somehow, when 

they were throwing out  those shorts, I must have caught two, maybe they were

somehow intertwined. So one I put on, and the other one I tore to pieces, and thi s 
Uncle 
Fred
 and Uncle 
Bert
, of course I gave t hem piece of that material, so the y 
could wipe their nose, j ust like I could wi pe my Œ  but Uncle 
Fred

A: Œ the

it; if I remember a present, you gave us that piece of cloth to wipe our Œ and that was

John 
went, at t hat 
time, to 
Colgate 
University, undergraduate school, and we used t o get Œ get up t here 

to visit Uncle 
Fred
, with his wife, and 
J ohn 
was there, so Œ it was not so far from 
here, anyhow. 

Q: Right, mm-hm. 
A: It was far, but not that far that you could not make it, you know, so Œ 
Q: Yeah, mm-
hm, yeah.
 
A: Œ we Œ we saw them, occasionally. But all t hese people were older than we both 

were, so eventually we are just by ourselves. You know,

piece of Œ 
A: A piece of un-underw
ear.
 
Q: Œ a piece of what had been a pra yer shawl, so that the y could wipe Œ you know, 
they could wipe Œ 

A: Nose. 

Q: Œ their noses. I want ed to go back a little bit  further, even before you™re deported, 

because from what I understand now, you lived really, several years under Nazi rule 

in 
Prague
. 
A: Oh sure, sure. 
Q: From Œ from ™38 Œ 

A: Thirty-nine to ™42.

Q: So duri ng that ti me, what was Œ  what was Œ 
did you 
Œ what did you hear about  
Richard Heydrich
, who was the leader Œ I mean, who was 
Hitler™s
 man in 
Prague
? 
What did you know of hi m? 
A: Well, of course I remember the name, 
H-
Heydrich
, of course. Wel l, one 
experience comes right to your mind. When he was killed, and the y were looking 
around for those parti-partisans, t he y used to call them, who they suspected killed 
hi m, well, we were livi ng in an apart ment Œ we were married, of course, and we 

were living in an apartment which was assigned to us, because the parents had to 

move out of the house where 
the y were 
Œ li ved. And the y were assigned to anot her 
Jewish family, which was, as soon as you remember 
Prague
 a little bit, near the 

Charles 
bridge. 

Q: Bridge. 
A: So we were livi ng in that neighborhood, and I do Œ I don™t know what I was 
doing, but most likely working for the Jewish organization Œ I shouldn™t call it that 

way, but that™s the wa y it was. 

Q: Well, it sounds like an authority. Like an authority Œ 

A: Jewish authority would be a better word. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
91
 
A: And I remember we were, of course, sleeping, and all of a sudden somebody 
burst into t hat room Œ I don™t know if they were soldiers, or 
SS
 soldiers, that I don™t 
remember, but they were moving the furniture, which was not ours, which was, we 

had the furnished room. The y were looking for some hidden escape routes which 

these partisans might have taken. That was the mi ddle of the night, whether it was 
10 - 12, that I don™t remember, but I remember very well when the y came. 
Naturally, we were scared to death in bed, sleeping and al l of a sudden somebody is 

there with weapons, and go Œ moving the furniture to see whether it™s a hidden 

staircase to go somewhere where that person mi ght have been hiding. 

Q: Right. 

A: But ulti mately, of course, the y didn™t Œ didn™t find anyt hing, they left. But it was 

very difficult. The Œ the conditions became worse. I don™t mean living conditions 
like eating, no. It was more the freedom of moving around, yes. Because you were 
supposed t o have the yellow star, and if the y caught you without  wearing it, wit hout 

having the documents which a non-Jew had t o produce, you Œ it  was punishable. 

And the office which I was working at, was just across from the headquarter of the 

Gestapo. So we had the Œ I have seen many thi ngs which normally people would not 

have seen, you know, t hat Œ 

Q: Such as? 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
92
 
A: Well, the trucks with the prisoners, and the mi streating of prisoners getting i nto 
the building, and al l thi s stuff. Was awful. That building was ori ginally a bank, and 

it was owned by a Jewi sh person. The name was called Œ like you have h
ere 

Citibank
, so that was called the 
Pets
chek
 bank. And he was known, you know, like 
you know here 
Rockefeller
, so he was known there as 
Petschek
 
t he banker, you 
know. But  what you have seen, yes, e-every 12 o™clock, a new guard came to 

replace the guard from the da y before. So you have seen the power, the might what 

they had at that time. The streets were Œ that particular location was at, that had all 

American president s there. It was a 
Hoover
 Street, it was a 
Wilson
 Street, and there 
were more of them. So why they hurried there, I don™t know, but that was that bank 

which the y used for the Gestapo, you know. 

Q: Was 
Œ was the Gest apo headquarters, now was that parallel to 
Vlasov™s 
ginanisty
(ph)?  
A: Yes. 

Q: Then I know the building.  

A: 
Vlasov™s ginanisty
(ph), you are absolut ely right. 
Vlasov™s gi nanisty
(ph),
 
it goes 
this way Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and that™s three-four Œ 
theparallel, yes, yes.
 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: Yeah, then I know t he Œ I Œ I™ve passed by the building, yeah. 
A: It was parallel. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And that™s Œ that section of 
Prague
 had all these American presidents™ name, 

probably just to show gratitude that they made Œ 
Q: Made. 
A: Œ established the 
Czech Republic
, or 
Czechoslovakia
 at that ti me, you know. 
But wi Œ again, the life was, before the Nazi s came, that was Œ we had the same 

freedom like here. There was no rel igious discrimination of any kind. If you were 

Jewish, you went to a Jewish temple, if you were Catholic, you went to a Cathol ic Œ 

Q: Church.  

A: Œ church, or wherever you went. That has changed. People became more Œ well, 
ma ybe afraid. Maybe t hat some of the true feeling also might have come out, you 
never know . 

Q: Well, going back to 
Heydrich
, when t he y burst in Œ into the room i n the middle 
of the night, did you have any idea why? Had you heard t hat 
Heydrich
 had been ch 

Œ

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh we Œ we knew, oh to sh Œ how can you not know? 
Heydrich
 was Œ you know, we had somet hing called 
l-a-n-y
, 
Lany
. 
Lany
 was like 
we have here in the 
United States
, 
Camp David
. 
Q: I see. 

A: You see, when the president wants to relax, we Œ whichever president, they don™t 
go into pol itics, you went to 
Camp Davi d
 because that was the sum mer, or the 
relaxation for the exi sti ng president. So we had that Castle 
Lany
. And 
Heydrich
 
was known that he travels between 
Lany
 and 
Prague
, because he wanted to enj oy 
the same thing like Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ the president enjoyed that 
Lany
, you know, the castle which was there. But 
somehow those partisans which were dropped by the Bri tish, the y found out hi s 
route, and eventually, naturally, kil led him by Œ I don™t exactly remember any more. 
The 
car
 was passing, and somehow exploded, or whatever. But it was big 

repercussions, yeah, because he was really t he right hand of 
Hitler
. So when the y 

killed the right hand of 
Hitler
, you know, the y wanted t
o show 
Œ and you know, 
they traced i t back Œ I don™t know if you heard that story, they tri Œ they traced it 
back that those partisans were sta yi ng, or were dropped off in a town called 
Lidice
. 

And out of sympat hy, naturally, here in the 
United States
, in 
Chicago
, there is a

suburb called 
Lidi ce
. Now, I don™t know if they have changed it since then, or 
whatever, but there™s a strong Czech communi ty i n 
Chicago
, and they wanted to 

show that somehow the Œ the west stands with that particular event. But, of Œ o
f 

course I remember it, and there were pictures of 
Heydrich
 left and right. He was the 
right hand of 
Hitler
, no doubt about it. 
Q: Now in Œ now, when they burst in in the middle of the night, t hat means it wasn™t 
the same ni ght that he yd Œ or the same da y that 
Heydrich
 had been attempted Œ 
A: No, we had aft Œ well, they were looking for the n Œ you know Œ 
Q: Right, for days.  

A: Œ and even if the y knew the Œ that Œ that the people are God knows where, or 

ma ybe the y were even killed, or whate Œ t he y wanted to show the power they had, 

and to im Œ inti mi date everybody else. 
Q: Were there other reprisals, after the y captured those Œ 
because I 
bel Œ 
A: I don™t remember exactly what would have happened afterwards, except that they 
took all these men, people Œ and not only men, boys Œ from the town of 
Lidice
, and 

they burned it down. Females had Œ I don™t know whether the y took the females, but 

it was awful, awful. And that kind of event warns the rest of the peopl e, you know, 

they Œ 
the y sa ythe non
-Jews were afraid to Œ  
Q: Right.

A: Œ you know, tal k with Jews, and Œ 
and th
e fear was spread all over. So it™s not 
like th-the people were against you. No, I t old you, m y best friend, he was playing 

soccer with me. Who cares whether he was Jewish or Catholic, or whatever. 
But the 

fear was there. So, out of fear, there was a certain Œ call it segregati on. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And Œ and it was i mposed by Œ by the system, you know.  
Q: Oka y, now let™s jump to after the war. When you came back, how did life 

develop for you out  of your sister-in-law™s apartment? After that, you get better, it ™s 

Œ 

A: Well, I t old you, somehow Œ I don™t know how I got the apartment, because there 

were also Germans who were thrown 
awa 
Œ not thrown awa y, but they made them 
go back to 
Germany
, or whatever. So I don™t  know how I got t he apart ment. 
Certainly didn™t pay for it, I had no money, I was a kid. Was it al lott ed to me by 

someone? I don™t remember that part. I know I stayed with 
Georgine
 until Œ and 
then her aunt, the one t hey were tal king about, the close, she came to visit us when 

she was expecting 
George
, the one who is a doctor near 
Washington
,
 D
.
C
. She was 
expecting him, and that was the first ti me she came to 
Prague
 and the first time they 

met  her, so to speak.  

Q: Also, excuse me, we haven™t tal ked about how did 
Georgine
 
come back?
 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: Well, 
G eorgine
, I don™t know how she came back, physically, but I think, which 
I mentioned to you, the French were trying desperately to put people together. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Now, if you thi nk who paid for it, definitely nobody. That was the government™s 

somehow obligati on, or whatever. 
Georgi ne
 was sick, and I remem ber very 
distinctly, when she came, there were two of her good, best friends who really made 

her survive. Did I remember the name? One was, I think, 
Ruth
 but they call her 
Chekruthka
(ph), and I forgot the second one. But the y were not from 
Prague
, so 
they sta yed in 
Prague
 for a couple of days before the y got  the connection to 

wherever the y going. One was through 
Moravia 
Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ which was the other state of 
Czechosl ovakia
. And I think the y l ost, you know, 
like alwa ys you lost track of each other, because people have different interests, and 
Georgine
, she needed surgeries. She developed a thyroid conditi on. The thyroid is 

not only that it takes away your breathing, but also she developed a 

[indecipherable]
 on the Œ on this side. That would be her left side, I t hink it was. So 

she had to have that taken out. It was not t aken out in 
Czechoslovakia
, but she was 
treated from it. Always the truth, i t was taken out when we came here, in 
New York 

City
. Not at the hospital, there used to be smal l op Œ small practices. That was done 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

on 
Park 
Avenue. Don™t hold me to it, but I remember it was on 
83
rd
 
Street, I think, 
between 
Park 
and 
Madison
, closer to 
Park
. And it had to be taken out, because the 
doctor said here that  she would Œ she would have difficulties. Now, come to think of 
it, why was it not done in 
Australia
? She had i t in 
Australia
. But, you know, 

Australia 
of 19 Œ when we got there, 1949, was a different 
Australia
 than 2013.  
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: The y were very backwards. Not because they were dumb or somet hing, it was the 

location. The y were so far away from anything, that i-it Œ 

Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Œ it was Œ it was a di fferent 
Australia
. That ™s why we also changed the name, 

because when I said m y name is 
Pekarek
, it was like tal king to, you know, God 
knows what. So i-it was Œ it was very difficult. Then, since she was here, she read 
her Œ that the treat ment here is much more progressive, with nucl ear energy.  
Q: I want t o go back to when she comes back to 
Prague
. 
A: Yeah, please. 

Q: Yeah. She™s sick. Di d you meet her Œ di d she return back to your Œ her sister™s 

apartment as well, and that™s where you met her? 

A: Yeah, but we had the Œ we had t he apart ment which I t old you I got in central 

Prague
.

Q: I know, but your first meeting, when she comes back, do you remember it?  
A: Well, I don™t think I remember exactly the first couple of days, not really. 

Q: Oka y. No, so you ha Œ all right. And Œ and what Œ but when she does come back, 

she™s very sick Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and so she needs t reatment. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And had you had your apartment that you were assigned, already by that ti me? 

A: Yeah, oh yes, yes. 

Q: I see. Oka y. 

A: I had the apart ment Œ you know, I was Œ I t old you I was in 
Prague 
April 20, 

when the nat Œ when the Germans were still there Œ 
Q: That™s ri ght, that™s right. 
A: Œ celebrat ing 
Hitler
. So, when the Œ when Œ when the revoluti on finished at May 
ninth Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ I somehow, couple da ys later, I got the apart ment, I don™t know how. 

Q: Oh, so it was within a few days, yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

A: But she wasn™t there yet , no, she came much later, because she was on the 
Russian si de, and the y were not so organized bringing the people back, like when 

you were somewhere on the western side. 

Q: Got it. 

A: So eventually she di d come back. Now how did she find me? Well, most likely 
through her sister. 
Q: Oka y. 

A:That™s m y guessing now 
Œ  
Q: Right. 

A: Œ 70 years later.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Do I remember exactl y how she found me? No. 
Q: And did you st art working again? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What were you doing? 

A: The same firm where I used to work before. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y claim Œ there™s a story to it also, they got it back because that 

[indecipherable]
 was theirs. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
101
 
Q: Right. 
A: And we Œ even if we had the left le Œ leaning government, it was t heirs, the y got 

it back. And Œ since they were quite well off, and they had connections to the 

United States
. How? The original owner was a very old man. He had quite a few 

children. In those da ys, you know, there were not so many precautions not to get  
children, or pregnant, or whatever. So he had, I think, five or six of them. And t wo 
were living here in the 
United States
 
v ery 
Œ before the war started. One was in 
Philadelphia
, and I don™t know where the other one was l iving. So, t hey got the 

thing back, but because it was so l eft-leaning, t he whole 
Czechosl ovakia
 after 

World War II, because the 
Soviet Union
, we were your protectors, and the country 
was really very much t o the left, which we didn™t care for. So this 
firm had 

difficulties with the labor force, because the y were delivering coal, 
c-o-a-l-l Œ 
you 
know, coal?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: What you 
Œ you know, don™t forget, nowadays, you have have gas, you have all 
kinds of things. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But in 
Prague
, coal was the thi ng to make your morning coffee. So, it was very Œ 
and horses were the ones which delivered t he coal. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
102
 
Q: Ah, so now I understand, you worked as an accountant for a coal  company. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: I see. I thought it was an accounting company. 

A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: No, it was a coal company. 
A: I was the account ant  Œ 
Q: For the coal co Œ 

A: Œ for a company which was sell ing coal .  

Q: Oka y. 

A: And the owner was an old man, he had several sons, but two of them worked in 

the firm. And it was a very successful firm. 

Q: Oka y, so now when the y come back, the y reclai m their firm, do they Œ if Œ what 
did Œ do the y eventually leave it, because you™re talking about thi s left-leaning 
government? 

A: Yes, yes, that™s what I wanted t o tell you. 

Q: So tell me. 

A: One of Œ so when Œ when Œ when this more left-leaning, more left-
wingish. So 
eventually Œ I don™t  remember if this was nati onalized or not, those things escape 

me. But 
H inn
ek
(ph), he was one of the sons, he wanted t o get out, but there was 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

103
 
nowhere to go. To get a visa permit here was very difficult, and the t wo 
[indecipherable]
 of his, well, you know, it™s very difficult to make a living here. 

Thinking about millions which they had over there, the y didn™t have the millions 

here. So he had difficulties coming, but I promised hi m when I went t o 
Australi a
 

that I will t ry to see whether I could get hi m some documents to get to 
Australi a
. 
Believe it or not, I did manage to help hi m, and he came to 
Australia
 eventually, 
with his wife, two chil dren, and he was driving a cab, of all things. Quite successful, 
but naturally money- wise no comparison to what he had been. But I™m pretty sure 
they must have had some money here, or something. 

Q: Oka y. So let™s go back to left leaning government in 
Prague
. The ownersare not 

happy, the y don™t want  to stay. What makes you not happy? What specificall y? 

A: The left-wingish thi ng. Look, you Œ for example, there were elect ions. You had 
to go with everybody i n that firm, and to sing the name of the leader, his name was 
Gotwald
(ph), and Œ and he was the only one who was running. So, having that 

experience from World War II, we have seen that the country is deteri orating. 

Q: So it was Œ bet ween ™40 and ™48, I was always under t he i mpressi on that it was 

still not a communist country. 

A: No, but it was very l eft-
wingish, yes.
 
Q: I see. I see. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013

A: And I would sa y not  between ™40 Œ between 1945 when we came back Œ 
Q: Forty-five, yes, that ™s right. 

A: Œ and 1 948, definitel y. Only one candidate. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: If you liked it or not , he was the only one, and naturally he was the communist 
leader. So it  was Œ it was not hundred percent communistic, but it was getting t here. 
Q: Oka y, so here™s the other questi on. You said that when the Nazis came in, 
because of their poli cies, it affected the relationships people had with each other. So 

thatif you were 
Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ had a 
frou
 who was nonjew Œ a friend who was non-Jewish, it became Œ 
yo u 
became estranged even through no desire of your own.  
A: There is Œ it had not hing true with it. If you Œ if you were not one of Œ for 
example, look, your kid couldn™t go to school , to a college, if he was from a 

bourgeois Œ they call it bourgeois family. 

Q: That™s what I wanted to find out. How did t hat develop now, after the war? 

A: Tha-That™s how it was. So when you Œ 

Q: Tell us. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
105
 
A: Œ when your chi ld was born from a bourgeois family, that chi ld couldn™t go to 
college. 

Q: Well, what was your family considered? 

A: Well, I had no children to begin with, but there was no family left, you know, so I 

didn™t have that kind of a problem, but you didn™t like it. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: It smell ed too much from controlled leftists. So Nazi Œ 
Hitler
 was too controlled 

from the right side. Thi s was the same damage on the left side. 

Q: I have Œ there™s one question I forgot to ask you before. 

A: Great. 

Q: When di d you find out what happened to your parents? 

A: Well, that™s a good question. I think m y sister survived, and I think she said she 
gave me the date when the y were, so to speak, transported from Œ from one camp to 
the Œ to 
Auschwitz
. 

Q: So, from 
Theresienstadt
? 

A: Yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: And when Œ once they got to 
Auschwitz
, there was no wa y that t hey could have 

survived, because my father would have been old, also a l ittle bit  on t he sick side. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Had difficulties with Œ not arthritis, I recalli ng it™s somet hing else. Had difficulties 
walking, I don™t remember the name, what they used it for. But they were old 

people, you know, now m y father was born ™78. So when he got to 
Auschwitz
, say 

1944 - ™45, so he was close to 70, where I™m now 90, but  that was a different time. 

Q: Yeah, he was 64 - 65.  
A: And Œ and you see here, you are a free person whether you live until 90 or 105. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You know? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But that was a controlled society. Jewish on top of it, so when they got there, the y 

h
ad no chance.
 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y had no chance. So m y si ster knew the date, and she told me. I forgot the 
date, of course, but she told me when the day came, she couldn™t hol d them 
as a 

dependent any more, and she was the Œ and they were deported. 

Q: I see, 
I see.
 

A: And once they were deported to 
Auschwitz
, well that was, of course, the end, 

you know?  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
107
 
Q: So okay, let™s go back to after the war. So you didn™t Œ you didn™t  like the wa y 
you saw things developing back in 
Prague
.  
A: Exactly. That was t he truth. 
Q: Yeah. What did you Œ what acti ons did you start taking? How did t hings devel op 

Œ 
A: Now see, that I couldn™t take any Œ  
Q: Œ from thought  to action?  

A: Œ I Œ I didn™t take any, except that I want  to get out wit h 
Georgine
. And being of 

that age, mi litary 
age 
Œ now, for example, when I came back, I had to join the arm y. 

Not that I wanted, t hat was a compulsory Œ  

Q: Right. 

A: Œ so for, I don™t  remember how many mont hs, I was Œ I was within the army 
office, but still I was in the armed forces 
Q: Right. 

A: And then they passed a law that people who were in a concentrati on camp, were 

exempt from that servi ce. So I came back to t he apart ment  which I had Œ  

Q: Right. 

A: Œ originally with 
Georgine
.  So 
Georgi ne
 came to visit me, how she got there, I 

don™t know, most 
likel y by bus, because wedid
n™t have a car. Have a 
car was a 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
108
 
luxury in t hose days. So she must  have come by bus to visit me, and naturally there 
was a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don™t make Œ 

what do you make? Nothing. So t here were some difficulties. Do I remember what 

difficulties? Not really. Somehow we made it. You know, ma ybe some money was 

left over from the father Œ her father. But you know, the Œ during that  kind of a 
situation that™s happeni ng here to someb Œ 
not w
ant to touch that 
that base,
 but when 
people Œ m y father-
in
-law, when Œ when t he y heard that this one was transported to 
some camp, and thi s one Œ so, as a precaution, the y gave Œ they had a housekeeper 
of the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some 

money. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now, 

60 Œ 70 years. So plasti c was a novelty. So, in 
Czechoslovakia
, when youhad 
Œ 
when you bought a drink, let™s sa y like a 
Coke
. Was not a 
Coke
, like 
a 
Coke
. So it 
has a top that you closed, you know, but i t was the old-fashioned t hing, which was 

very difficult and ma ybe not nice looking. So he did a lot , with a part ner, plastic Œ 

you know Œ 

Q: Screw t op. 

A: Œ th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and 
[indecipherabl e]
 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
109
 
A: So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. So he gave his 
housekeeper 
X 
Œ 
no idea how much Œ dollar, but you keep it, and then they come 
back Œ you know, you give it back to us. Well , there are lots of peopl e who didn™t 

come back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in 

ﬁ
The Wall  Street Journal
ﬂ not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to 
Elise
 to read. Why?  Because it turned out t hat 
New York
 state, there are unclai med 
insurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In t he bi ll Œ b Œ 
in the 
billions. And the story was that 
New York
 state can get this if it sta ys unclai med, 

because there is a law, if you don™t claim 
X
 after so many years, i t becomes the 
property of the state. So naturally, 
New York
 state, I can i magine if t hey could get a 
couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, banks, and I™m 
telling to you out of experience, 
Georgine
 knew that her father had t he life 

insurance polic y wi th 
X
 Œ  I forgot the name. So when we came here, we tried to get 
in touch with those people, we found some document showing t hat he had this, and 

he had that, and whatever. So the answer whi ch we got, if I woul d look for it, I 

would find it. I™m not going to take the time now Œ 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
110
 
A: Œ and I will not  take the ti me then either. But the y responded t hat we have to 
produce a death certificate. Now, t o get a deat h certificate for somebody who passed 

away in 
Auschwitz
, is like Œ I don™t have t o tell you. So nothing happened. But that 

means that that poli c y was never consummated. So, if he was ent itled to those 

benefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. So real ly, the unclaimed 
amounts which are there, must be in the Œ well, I™m telling you, the story was Œ 
th e y 
mentioned ski 
Œ I think, two billion dollars. Because I™m sure m y father-in-law 
wasn™t the only person who did this.  

Q: But you™re talki ng Œ 
when you™re 
talking about where the y were unclai med, it  
was in the Œ 
Czechoslovakia
 where it was unclaimed? 

A: Yeah, yeah, in 
Czechoslovakia
, yeah, yeah.
 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. 
A: Yeah, but there™s Œ if the mone y would have been somehow, sa y i nherited by 
Georgine
, or 
Œ or somehow Œ 
Q: Right. That™s ri ght. 

A: Œ it would have come Œ 

Q: Come t o Œ 

A: Œ or ma ybe to her si ster while she was still in the uni Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
111
 
A: It was never paid, because we could not prove Œ 
Q: His deat h. 

A: Œ his death. And I™m sure there were cases, God knows how many, because l ots 

of people didn™t come back, especially older people, you know, t he young peopl e 

might have survived 
[indeciphera ble]
 about t he older people had no chance. So 
we™re Œ 
I™m justtelling youwhat happenedin ﬁ
Wall Street Jour
na l
,ﬂ which I enjoy 
reading, but  that™s not t he issue. So the si tuation was Œ it was varied. It was not t he 

same 
Czechoslovakia
, like it was when it was founded. No. 

Q: Wer 
Œ were you still  there when 
Jan Masaryk
 was killed? 
A:Yes, yes, yes.
 

Q: What can you tell us about that, and what happened to Œ 
how did youexperience 

it, what di d you Œ 
A: Well, we experienced only that somehow he jumped t o his death. That was the 
official version. Now, t he unofficial version was that the y threw hi m out of the 

window. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Now, what was true? That depends on what side you are on. 

Q: What do Œ were people frightened to speak to one anot her?  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
112
 
A: Oh yes. Oh, definitely, because you didn™t know what the other person would do 
to enhance his posi tion, whatever he was doing , he or she, yes. It was not the same 

Czechoslovakia
, no. And that is i n a wa y part of what you™re aski ng me, why didn™t 

Œ it was not just t his threat from the 
Soviet Union
, we di dn™t have anything, so what 
would I have taken, and we just came back. B ut it was everything, you know, the 
distrust of each other. The quality of life wasn™t the same. By far not  the same. 
Religion, the religi on we didn™t practice a religion anyhow, so that didn™t make any 

different. But the life was not the same, no. You talked to a neighbor, you were 

afraid in case you sa y something, it might be t urned over against you. If you were 

more o
n the liberal side, rather than communistic side. If you said you don™t like Œ 
I™m just saying Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ as an example, if you didn™t like thi s guy, and he was a prominent, sa y 
politician, 
Prague
, or whatever. So i-it was not the same country, by any mean. But 
it was not t he same country for two reasons. Unfortunately, the German occupation 

did it, and the Russian t hreat continued duri ng it. So that was not that 

[indecipherable]
 who were the Œ originally the spirit. That was Œ was missing, that 

wasn™t there. And speci ally this aunt of mi ne, who survived the war i n 
Israel
, it was 

not 
Israel
, it was 
Palestine
. It™s the same t hing 
anywa y.
 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: Yeah. 
A: So she didn™t like it, and she was alerting us to these t hings more t han we did, 

because we were thrilled that we are free. We were free. So, for us, we didn™t see it. 

But she s Œ she was, like I sa y, a different oy Œ  age, from a different country
.  She 
saw it differentl y, you know? The wa y she was living, I remember certain things, 
that she was living in 
Vienna
, she married in 
Vienna
. And she came to 
Prague
 with 
her husband, and sh Œ I can™t tell you the year. Oh, it must have been before ™39, 
before 
Hitler 
came. She was saying that this is a unstoppable wave, t hat anything 

what is somehow German, will become Nazi German. And I thi nk she was right. 

Why? I told you earlier, because 
Hi tler
 provided jobs, and even the people who 

were Œ who had not hing to do with it, became pro-Nazi. I l ike to say Nazi 

Germany
, because I don™t blame toda y™s generation for what happened 50 - 70 
years ago. Le Œ I mean, these peopl e who are t oda y Germans Œ I mean, of course 

they are German, because the y were born t here, I mean, the y questioned their ol d 

grandparent s. I mean, how could you have not known, or why could you have 

condoned t his, you know? Different from today™s world than it was at the ti me, but 

when I talk about 
Germany
, I usually sa y Nazi 
Germany
, or 
Germany
. 
Q: Yeah.

A: Because I™m gett ing a pension, small pensi on, couple hundred dol lars. Really, it™s 
not even worth talking about it. Depends on the exchange rate. So 
Georgine
 got for 
the m
onth of May, 200 dollars, and I got five Œ 200 dollars, another 500 dollars, 
something, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So toda y, in this world, 700 dollars amount s Œ is not going t o make me rich or 
poor. Yes, it helps me t o maintain
 Georgi ne
, which I told you. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: But those article, they had nothing to do with the Holocaust. Those articles, 

they™re like 
John™s
 age, or even younger. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A:I mean, whyshould the y 
[indecipherable]
 they, 
throughtaxation, pay me 
X
 
dollars? Wel l, I™m looking at it, I™m telling you how I feel about i t. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Do I accept it? I would be craz y not to accept it, but really Œ 

Q: The guilty Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ are not Œ the guilt y ha Œ wer Œ got awa y with it.

A: You don™t understand me? Sweetheart, I t old you I li ke to sa y the truth, this is a 
truth. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: 
I accept
 t hing, well yes, I accept it, because I was working there and all that 
rubbish di d happen. But you Œ I™m wondering why this generation stole everything? 
Do the y feel any moral  guilt? Where Œ 
would Ifeelmoral guilt,what my grandfather 
might have done? I don™t know. I™m just asking a civilized question, you know? 

Q: Yeah
. Yeah
. It™s one question t hat is Œ it™s Œ there™s so many quest ions in these 
events, that Œ for which there were no answers, and yet we still look for them. 

A: That™s what you sa ying 
[indeci pherable]
 saying that™s how I feel, you know? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: If they send me the check, yes I take the m one y, because automatic it™s coming to 
m y account, so I take it , you know. But from a human poi nt of view, from m y 
personal point of view, I wonder how I would feel if I would be in that situation. His 

Œ they didn™t cause it. It was the grandfather, or the grand-grandfather. And to Œ to 

analyze what reasons that person had 50 years ago Œ you only can 
[indecipherable]
 

to 
almighty God.
 

Q: Let™s tal k a little bit about
 Geor gine
, if we can. 

A: Sweetheart, 
Georgine
,she™s m y wife
 for 70 plus years. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
116
 
Q: Yes. 
A: I told you that she was there, right here, where we are. 

Q: What I mean is, just give me the outlines of what happened to her, when you 

were split apart. She was Œ 

A: Sweetheart, she went through 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And anybody who went through 
Auschwitz
, and saw that misery, and had a 
heart, and if sh Œ if u Œ she was lucky that she didn™t have to work, alt hough when 

they came here, she did. Remember, she had a British passport, so she was worki ng 

for the British consulat e on 
Rockefeller Center
.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: How long, I can™t Œ I don™t remember, short while, then she got another job. But 
that™s not t he issue. So she was lucky that she could have sta yed home. She sta yed 
home when she becam e pregnant. Well, that was another reason why she had al l that 

surgery, because the y were sa ying, if you treat it with nuclear energy, she will 

become steri le. And as a young woman, you know, you didn™t li ke that. So she had 

the surgery rather than the Œ  

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
117
 
A: Œ treat ment, and eventually, just like I said, we were working about two years or 
so, and she became pregnant. We had Œ she had a vacation, I had a vacation, and 

was like summerti me, she quit her j ob. Well, then, you know how it takes, it takes a 

few months to get to that place. So she was very happy, she was a hundred percent 

mother. And having seen all these children perish in 
Auschwitz
, she devoted her life 
to children. Truth is the truth. So she went  when 
John
 was six, kindergarten, or 
whatever that system is here. She started to be on the school board. Not as a teacher, 

she was never a teacher. And through her persistence, integrity, or int erest, 

whatever, she was on t he school board for 32 years. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: So here, in this country, the y s Œ in the local school board here, there™s a room 

dedicated to 
Georgine™s
 32 years of being on t he school board, gi ving service to t he 
children. Now, if we would have t ime, she has literally hundreds of these things, 
what were Œ  now we have this. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: So we have all kinds of wooden plaques, testi monials, we had it here hanging. 

Well, you know, they changed. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
118
 
A: I don™t blame them. This is 
[indecipherabl e]
. The y had here hanging, honorary 
doctorate. She has a couple of honorary doctorates. What I™m telling you, like I j ust 
told you, I am not a person who will make things bigger t han they are Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ this is the truth. Where it is now, I don™t know.
 Elise
 has a tendency to change 
things. Which is fine, I™m Œ she™s a very hardworking person, and I told you, I l ike 

all three of them. What happened to it, I don™t know, it was alwa ys hanging here. So 

ma ybe the y put it i nside, or something, I don™t  know. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Was a proclamati on of one university, honorary doctorate in, li ke the y called 

letters, or something? Like writing. 

Q: Did you Œ did you t alk with one another about what you both went  through, a lot? 
A: Very little. 
Q: Very little. 

A: No, no, because she has the same like I went. Luckily, we bot h came back. 

Q: But you know, here™s another t hing that™s unusual. You got marri ed, so that you 

wouldn™t be called up for the army. Everybody Œ  

A: At that time we don™t be deported Œ 

Q: To Œ 
excuse me 
Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ to be deported to 
Theresienstadt
. 
A:Yes, yes, y
es. 
Q:Oka y. So you didn™tget married 
Œ 

A: Wa 
Œ one little thing. We were kids. 
Q: Yes. How old were you? 

A: I married when I was 20. She was 16. We had to have permissi on from our 

parents. 

Q: And the y gave t he permission? 

A: Oh sure. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Well, because they knew what™s coming. 
Q: So one could say that you didn™t get married for the most Œ I would say normal Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ usual of reasons? 

A: A hundred percent right. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s t he truth.  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

120
 
Q: And then when you™re together, you™re young, but s
omewhere after 
Theresienstadt
, you™re separated. And you go through the kinds of experiences that 

can shatter a person. 

A: Yes. 

Q: You both survi ve, you come back, and t hen you spend a lifetime together. That™s 
unusual.I mean,so many people 
Œ  that is, so many peopl e can come back from such 
traumatic experiences, and the y™re changed inside. 
A: Well, we Œ we changed to a certain extent. She got involved with the schools. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And I was ma Œ 
much more,
 say for going to the 
Metropolitan 
O pera
. So I Œ 
f inancial were different. So I bought a subscription for two of us. Naturally, we were 

married Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ we were vi Œ di Œ we used to go, there was a show here on 
Broadway
, 
whatever it was, not i mportant. So we had tickets, two tickets to go to the 

Metropolitan Opera
. But now al l of a su Œ oh 
J o hn 
Œ Frank
, I won™t be able to 

make it because I have to see Commissioner so and so from the education 

department. So I had two tickets, I went, and I sold one, or gave it away, or whatever 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde

121
 
I did. So t hat went  on for about three years like that, that I had two tickets, very 
seldom we used them. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Seldom. But we still had the same interest, we had the same background. We 

knew our parents, her parents, it was the same. She knew my parents, of course. So 
nothing real ly has changed, really. And proof is what I™m sa ying i s we are Œ 
Q: Seventy-
one years.
 
A: And then Œ and Œ and financially I told you what it cost . If you multiply by 50, 

and multiplied by five, six years, you don™t talk about 10 dollars. 

Q: No. 

A: Do I have any regrets? No. I consider this is my responsibility, no. 

Q: What it Œ just for the sake of the interview, we™re talking about  
Georgine
, who is 
no longer able to participate in Œ 
A: Very little. 

Q: Œ normal activiti es. Who is we Œ not well. 

A: Well, m y 
Œ there was a story in the papers. If you want to read i t, we have made 

copies, that goes back about two, three years. You know what, I tell you somet hing, 

I have to go to m y office, and give you a copy. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
122
 
A: Our life has changed, m y life in particular. Because now, I go to eat dinner at 
four o™clock. I come home when 
B ibi
 comes, she comes usually at  six, I come 
usually home at 5: 15 - 5:30, because it™s only a mile. So I come home. We either 

bring them, or they 
[indecipherable]
 
or what ev
er, that™s not the i ssue. And then she, 
when 
Bibi
 comes, six o™clock, summerti me, wintertime, I go to sl eep. And again, I 
told you, m y hours have shifted.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I get up at two o™clock, three o™clock. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Do I complain? No, I just Œ thi s is fine, this is the life it is, my obli gation. She™s 

sick, so either you get 
[indeciphera ble]
 
not me 
[indecipherable]
 or you do what 
you have to do. And I feel this is what I have t o do. We married, we were kids
.  My 
responsibility was the same as it was 50 y
ears ago.
 
Q: When you 
Œ 
A: Before you go, I give you the st ory from the newspaper. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Free of charge. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y Œ t he y made copy Œ made a bunch of copies. 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
123
 
Q: And the story from t he newspaper is about what? 
A: Well, is what I™m telling you, that we were separated because of 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Oh, I see, it™s about you. The st ory from the newspaper is about you, oka y.  

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, about Œ well, it was about both of us, but actuall y i t™s more 

about what I™m doi ng with Œ you know, I was alwa ys working. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Some of u Œ I mean, one of us had to make a living.  

Q: Did you feel like you were a different person when you came back from 

Auschwitz
, though? 

A: Oh sure Œ oh, from 
Auschwitz
, of course. I was a grown-
up man,
 I was a kid 
when I went in. No, no question about it. You understood what life is, what brutal ity 

is. Don™t forget, there were instances where some prisoners want ed t o escape. 
Russian in particul ar, I have to say the trut h. You know, we had t o witness when 
they were literally beaten to death. Why di d they ask us to witness thi s? To 

discourage other peopl e from doing it. And that™s pi Œ after all these years, I™m still 

seeing it once in a while. When I start thing li ke now, talking about it. Sure. Was 

awful. So you have grown up, no question about it. You were a child, you were 

inexpere Œ when we came out, we were chi ldren. I wanted to buy the house. The y 

were talking about real estate ex Œ I had no clue. So this friend Œ not friend, she was 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
124
 
a client of mine, sai d well, do you have any m one y? Remember, 3,000 dollars down 
payment. Was a different down Œ different time. 

Q: In the 1950s here. 

A: Yeah. So I said, not really. Sh-She said to me Œ I will never forget her, well you 
can™t just get a mort gage without having some mone y in t he bank. For me that was, 
you know, a revelat ion, what is she talking about? So she loaned me 3,000 dollars, 

which was 10 percent from what was needed for the down payment. Of course I paid 

her back, this is not the question. But that ™s how it was. 

Q: Well, one of the thi ngs that I find Œ somet hing that I can™t i magine, because I™ve 

had a normal life, rather than this kind of life. 

A: Well, we didn™t have the normal life. You said the right thing. 

Q: You know, is one of the things that Œ 
when somebody goesthr
ough something 
like that, and they see t his kind of brutality, can you ever really laugh again? Can 

you 
Œ when do you start enjoying life again? 

A: Well, you know, truthfull y, you try to push it awa y, you know, and you 

concentrate on what we did toget her. You know, we went shopping together. She 

was normal , don™t forget, she was a normal  person.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: So Œ not that I™m putting her down or something Œ 

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
125
 
Q: No, no, no, no, no, no  
A: Œ I™m just sa yi ng the true, we used to go to 
Lord & Taylor
, I remember. When 

we bought the house, we Œ we bought a car. And you just look out the window 

there™s a tree, stupidly we planted i t right next  to the house. Well, we went Œ I had a 

Chevy
, and we thought  to make it more Œ more trees. So we bought a tree which 
was bigger than thi s thi ng here. Well, now it™s 50 years ago, now i t™s tremendous, 

you know. So we were sharing life together. She grew int o it, I grew i nto it, but we 

grew into it together, not separately. Separatel y was only the circumstance which Œ 

which made us separat e, you know? 

Q: Got it. 

A: And that was a story in the paper, you know. I couldn™t get out of 

Czechoslovakia
 because of that military age. Well, 
I managedto get
 that British 
passports, so
 that was not a pretense of some kind of divorce or separation. 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: It was j ust to survive. We was j ust so panicky with survival. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And Œ and the only way to do i t was well, you go first, and somehow I managed 

to get out by m yself, because I will take a suitcase and go. But now, if we are two, 

it™s a different thing.  

 
Interview with Frank Hyde  
 
May 4, 2013 
 
 
 
126
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And that™s exactly what happened, so when I f Œ got to stay, I tol d you before, 

she took the plane and came back. Of course she came back. 

Q: Is there Œ 

A: Œ was not some kind of a second marriage, or something.  
Q: No. Is there Œ no. Is there Œ is there anyt hing that you™d like to add to what we™ve 
talked about toda y, that you think it™s i mportant for Œ 

A: If I would take it back? 

Q: No, no, no. Is t here something you would l ike to add?  

A: Oh, add. Well, t he only experience I would like to tell you about, when I was 

working for General Motors, which I told you, photography here. When I went to 

General Motors, no English. So, since I had some experience from t he concentration 
camp Model 
As
. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So my sister go to General Motors, the y pay good salary, 10 pounds, or what ever 

it was in those da ys, and I was having

 which is somet hing li ke 
this, and then the t ube goes in like this. And I was working on brake drums. Now the

Q: Right. 
A: Œ brake pedal and stuff. So naturally, since everybody knows how not handy I 

am, I am st ill sa ying that 
GM
 went down financially because of the automobiles wh-

which I fixed up. But they are still  recalling the cars which I did. Well, of course 

that™s a joke Œ 
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ because there are gauges, the y called t he gauges Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ and it was after every so often you had to check to be sure that it™s that way. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I™ll leave that st ory a-apart from what I was doing. Well, t hen we came here, 

you know, here was Œ you started to work, you went to school, l earning English, 
accounting, expressions,
 and Engl ish to begin with. I told you we thought in

was. I was with a cl ient in Œ in his house, and I don™t know why he had the 

television on at that  day, t hat I don™t remember. But we had it on for some reason or 

another, and then I saw it. Well, I saw that the pilot made a mistake, of course. Why 
would I think that it™s a terrorist att ack? And the same things wit h 
Auschwitz
.  Why 
would anybody think that a sophisticate nation like the Germans would come up 

with somet hing li ke this because of religion, or where you come from? Unheard of. 

And the same is wi th t hat 9/11, where did you think that that would be planned? 

Q: Yeah, yeah.

now, the

something in the future would come up wi th some craz y person like

story, ﬁ
Wall Street Journal

Œ I™m not t rying to sell the ﬁ
Wall Street Journal

that™s what I™m reading, so that™s what I™m talking about. The y were talking about 

the preemptive stri-stri ke. If someone like this happened t o be somewhere, the y were 

talking about
