A: You know I was student and still I was looki

ute and still I am in 
business mostly line. 

 
Q: You went to the Polytechnic Institute too? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: When did you go to that school? 

 

A: After I come  back from c oncentration camp and a fter 1947 I come  back to Poland because we 
were hoping Poland be free country and never 
happened and after I was inWa rsaw 1947 I 
intend to finish my Polytechnic engineering, Polytechnic Institute, engineering line. And I 

finish and I was all time thinking going to the Un
ited St ates. And ma ybe 
we go back little bit 
because 1939 start war and 1939 I was mobilized to sp
ecial army unit.  We  fortificate, we build 
the forts reinforcing concrete fort s against th
e Germans in north part of Poland where was on 
this small river, very dangerous, small deep rive
r, we build our Polish fortification. And this 
fortification was going up to 17 September 1939. 
And first bomb Ger man drop was notWa rsaw, 
the other place, was our (?) where we fortificate 
on our fortification and German ar my s t art in 
fight Poland and our unit go back to east to Ru
ssian Soviet border and th
is was seventeen days 
like this and meantime the Soviet throw fr om th
e plane information all units st op fi ghting with 
the Russians and Germa ns and go. We  are your 
friends. In Se ptember 17, the Russian-Soviet 

army invite in Poland no declaration of war and gi
ve us the knife in our army from the  back.  
And that was very upset and we was very sc
ared what happene d. Because two big colossus 
from Ger ma n sixteen mi llion and from Russian eight
een million we have absolutely no chance.  
And Russians took all our -- 17 September -- couple 
of days we were fighting with small group, 
pro-Soviet group, Communi
st group in this area close to 
East Polish border and near the 
Lithuanian border in {Orani} that was less 
small fighting and Russian Soviet tanks was 
surround our group and we was forced to surrende
r. After Soviet took our unit and arrested, 
start selection.  Some  old officers 
were sent on one side and later th
is officer was killed  in (? }.  
Some  group was selected young people like me  and w
ith the future, army officers, I was trained 
future army officers on other side. And people 
who was rank not with the privates were sent 
home . And we were arrested a
nd first night I was with my othe
r friends in one room in barn 
and some  fellow who, Soviet, who 
took the guards, let us go duri
ng the night after I give my 
watch and twenty Polish zloty because was coup
le hundred people there and this fellow took for 

us and six guys, we went out. We  di vide in 
six groups and I took with my  friend fromWa rsaw 
and we go west toWa rsaw because this place 
was very clos e to Russian border.And two guys 

go north and went to Lithuania and later there to
 Sweden and from Swede n to England and fight 
against the Germans there. We were not so lucky because we must cross the Bug River and go 

toWa rsaw and we did this and was ve ry har
d, ve ry dangerous because there were so many 

Communist sympathizers who 
start threat our military men, we were in uniform. 
 

Q: Stillinuniform? 

 

A: Unifor m, it was very dangerous. We  tried to
 go through the night thr
ough the woods going west 
because we were scared about the Communist 
and between the Polish Communists were very 

ma ny Jewis h Communists. Wa s very danger, notonly for Polish, for Jewi sh people was danger.  

Communists were worki
ng with the Soviets. 
 

Q: Were there a lot of Communists in Poland? 

 

A: Not too ma ny was Communists in Poland and st ill was some  and very funny thing, after the war 

the Communists go to Russia and was killed late
r there by (?) because wa
s (?) sayi ng this are 
spies [shpyons]for west. 
 
Q: Why do you suppose these peopl
e sided with the Communists? 
 

A: I think this was like all over the world, people th
inking what is nice in 
the book, what is nice in 
ideology probably is nice in practice, and never 
wa s. That happened right now in Russia after 

70 years old nobody like to be Communists becaus
e Communists was only good for some  s mall 
group people who are on the top. This
 was nothing else 
like dictatorship. 
 

Q: What did they teach you in sc
hool about Russia and the Communists? 
 

A: Excuseme .  

 

Q: When you were going to school in Poland? 

 

A: In school nobody special talk about the Communis
ts and we know from t he press, from the life, 
from the discussion what is in Russia.  But nobody know live inAmerica what was in Russia. 

We  know.  I born almost anti-Communist because I 
feel myself I am Christian, I am a Catholic.  
I feel if I have two hands I must do everyt
hing what is possible good for me  and for other 
people and I never grabbe d the hand and steal 
somebody or kill somebody for something what I 
like have.  I was born anti-Communist and I™m gl
ad right now I live so 
long and the Communist 
fell down. That™s  very bad ideology and not practical. 
 

Q: So were you able to get back toWa r saw? 

 
A: After one, two months together
 with my friend we foundWa rsaw, family living inWa rsaw very 
bad condition because house was destroyed. And fr
om there our fa mily start rebuild.  Was all 
time very -- my father was very, mother too, very
 hard working people, very ambition, and very 
good Catholics and try to rebuild our fa mily ag
ain and we start again, business, and we  go 
through the occupation time .  I was arrested
 couple time s from 1940 to 1944. Wa s couple 
reason.  Each day inWa r saw was killed hundred
 people because Poland was fighting against the 
German, not  against the German against the Nazi. 
That™s a big difference -- Nazi and German.  
And we special our young people was very anxious
 fight with German. Once I was arrested 
after I help some  Jewish people. The girl bring 
to my father factory some small needle what we 
need for production. And we bought from this girl
. We  know the girl are from Jewish fa mily 
and was very nice person. We  bought and after 
couple days the girls co
me back and after the 
girls come back the German cri minal Polizei arre
st me and start searchin
g our house, my father, 
mother house, because I live with parents at this 
time  and working for my father in factory and 
was one of the first arrested. 
 
Q: What was the charge? 

 

A: Charge was what kind connection I have with 
the Jewish people, why I help and was against 
some  very interesting situati
on.  My mother speak German a
nd start asking the fellows why you 
are arrested my son did nothing 
and the fellows search, the othe
r three guys search our house 
and find in my drawer couple twenty dollars gold 
and the chief who take the search give me  the 

paper and prepare some thing in German what I sign and was I found in house in Rome  

occupied by (? ) twenty dollars so ma ny pieces.  
And I sign. And the fellow was from criminal 

Polizei , criminal police. And after moment the 
fellow go down from third 
our floor to street.  
My mother started crying and asked release 
my son. And the fellow took the gold pieces not 
show the other guy who searched and releas
ed me.  I come  back to my house. 
 
Q: Was it illegal to ha
ve those gold pieces? 
 

A: Wa s not illegal and this was really value 
that we can do some thi
ng, buy some thing to eat. 
 

Q: How did you get the gold pieces? 

 

A: Oh that™s no problem because this time inWa rsaw mostly the gold was va luable thing and you 
can buy and sell and something like this, you know,
 and it was in my fa mily, we was not poor 
people, you know, and that was one, and I never saw 
the girl again, she wa s 
killed or sent to 
concentration camp. 
 

Q: When did this happen? 

 

A: This was happened 1942 some thing like this. 

 

Q: So when there was a ghetto– 

 

A: Ghetto was already open and second arrest 
by Gestapo was I was acros
s the border to ghetto 
ma ny ti me s because we buy some  s mall part of the machinery what we own and before the war 

all the supply was in the ghetto area and we wa
s forced buy some thing because we cannot work 
with this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto. And meantime if I go 

to ghetto I take all time something to eat to pe
ople who live there, sandwiches or some  bread or 
some thing like this and one very bad SS ma n on the border– 
 

Q: Checkpoint. 

 

A: Checkpoint start checking me  and so I have so
me  sandwiches and sent me  right away to Polish 
commissariat, mean the Polish prison and from there start not so bad because I was only one 

night there and I suppose to be sent to worki
ng camp in Germany and because my father was 
connected with underground and Polish police befo
re the war was second was friendly with my 
father too.  My father took some  connection 
and I was free and I never –(There was a loud 

bang and interruption) 
 

Q: You were talking about your second arrest. 

 

A: My second arrest and I wa s in Polish prison one 
night and one day and after my father talked to 
somebody famous in Polish police I was releas
ed I was supposed to go toArbeitAmt to 
German office and I supposed to send to Germ
any and never happened.  I was together with 
fa mily from this. 
 

Q: When did you get arrested the second time? 

 

A: That was the second time . 

 

Q: What date was thar? 

 
A: That was about ™42, ™43. 

 

Q: The first one was Nove mber 1942 and the second? 

 

A: Wa s ™43, some thing like this. 

 

Q: This was before the ghetto rebelled against the Ge rmans. 

 

A: Before, right.  During this mo ment you me nti
oned the ghetto uprising, we was very, very upset 
and we cannot eat. I reme mber this mome nt we
 was called and the whole ghetto was burning.  

And the sme ll was so terrible and besides this 
we know we left there ma ny good people.  I was 
very close with the Jewish peopl
e in ghetto because branch what 
my fathe r  was -- knitting, me .  
And in knitting line was ma ny Jewis h factorie
s and ma ny Jewish hokseller (?) what we was 
connected automatically because it was the busin
ess and ma ny Jewish pe ople, X number, very 
fair playing business me n.  Some  wa s bad and 
some  was good and we was very upset after we 
saw theWa r s aw burning. And before theWa rs
aw burning my father and me , we took three 
fa milies from ghetto and we found location, not me
, my father mostly --was very good person, 
very good Christian, and took the Christianity for 
daily not only during Sunday.  In other words 
took everyt hi ng what think is right did. This mo
me nt because we received, father and me , we 
received special privilege going to ghetto buy
ing some thing what we need for supplying our 
machinery.  People were crying please, good people couple good fa mily you know wa s 

connected to us and before the war Jewish upr
ising my father found th
ree places where the 
people can hire.  One of the places was the Swedish Embassy inWa rsaw and there was 

housekeeper, Polish fami ly, and was very devoted Chri
stian. And this people said to my father 
if you have no choice and you are like help the Je
wish people we can hire the people.  (Female 
voice in the background said ﬁhide™
).And my father took some  ve
ry big risk because only one 
country on Europe during the war German sugges
t if some body hire Jewish be killed on spot, 
what happene d thousand, thousand times. And still my father took the chance and took the 

fa mily, Malame d fa mily, Benyami n Malame d 
and Irena Malame d with two young sons took 
from ghetto with the housewives what we ha
ve and transferred to theWa rsaw Swedish 
Embassy. These people lived th
ere without the big risk. Af
ter mo me nt where German and 
Jewish agent start one action where German sugg
est and propose if Jewish fa mily, Jewish me n 
like be transfer toAmerica or to other count
ry and against the German who was captured by 
Aryans and pay some  money, th
at is possible.And this idea was created by agent, Jewi sh 
fellow, son of the fa mous Fabricant in Lodz and this fellow organized with the SS Gestapo 

some  place inWa rsaw close to our factory 
{Duga} Hotel Polski and sent  all over the 
information we transfer Jewish people against 
the German pe ople in the hands of theAryans 
and each person must pa y some  hundred dollars
 in gold. And my fa mily, Mr. Malame d 
believed this and one day said, I am going to Hote
l Polski and I be glad 
to be transferred to 
America and fromAme r ica some German be transferred here who was in hands ofAmerican 

army or some other army, prisoner of war. A
nd this my fr iends go there to Hotel Polski  and 

from this moment we lose the track. After 
couple weeks we know these people went to some  
concentration camp on t he west and later there we
 learned that that was Bergen-Belsen because 
Polish underground look which transport come  back and probably some  search was done by 

Polish underground army and we know the people go west and later there we know was in 

Bergen concentration camp. After the war 
1946 I took couple of days off from duty in 
American army and I went to Bergen-Belsen, lo
ok for my friends. And I was too late. Two 
weeks before I arrived there Ma
lamed fa mily went to Israel. 

 
Q: So they survived? 

 

A: They survived and that™s one family. We  r
eceived later there from Pa
lestine and later from 
Israel many cards from this family, very, very
 good people.  Now second two fa mily what we 

did and I was help to father because I was one family me mber to work with father because I 

was twenty two years old, I was not young like my
 brother, sixteen, or my sister, twelve or 
fifteen.  Second fa mily what we try hide wa
s in Hungary Embassy, very fa mous place on the 
cornerAleyawiadofskin and Chopina, Ulica Ch
opina inWa rsaw where the old embassy was 
before the wa r two. And again the supervisor 
of the whole Hungarian Embassy was my father 
friend and again my father pleas for the favor hire
 these people. And this gentlema n said fine 
and we sent the two fami ly, one was Mr. Landa u and wife with son.  Mr. Landau was in our 

branch, both Jewish people was in the same  
branch, knitting.  Me. Landau was owner of the 
stocking factory in Lodz and we was very good connected. 
 

Q: So he was from Lodz, not fromWa rs aw? 

 

A: From Lodz and later there was inWa rsaw ghett
o. We  know him from Lodz and was inWa rsaw 
ghetto and we took these people, not really we 
because I not was there, my father created 
different situation asked some  Polish policeman 
who took the people and bring to the place here 
supposed to be mean to Hungarian Embassy.  I wa
s couple time  there visit. This was not nice 
place because was in baseme nt, second baseme
nt below the gr ound level because this was 
building years, years ago belonged to very famo us Polish aristocracy. And this was below, 

second floor below the gr ound because was wine cel
lar and this people was there for x number 

of months.  I visit there. The people receive 
each couple days special food there and this time 
you must be very careful buy big amount of food
 because people think you are single why you 
buy so much, if it was possible to buy. And 
this building was not occupied by nobody because 
was partly destroyed. And still my father 
friend was each day there 
and watched after the 
building.The same  talking you know, go to the pe
ople and bring him some thing. And was very 
fa mous situation inWa rsaw where maybe you know from the  other sources, inWa rsaw was SS 

very brutal ma n Kutschera, General Kutschera 
and this animal killed people each day by own 
hand and was escorted each day by twenty, thirty chairmen with guns and gun prepared to shoot 

if some body attacked the SS ma n Kut s chera and 
main office Kutschera was three buildings 
from the place where our people was hire in th
e baseme nt and we was thinking and the people 
was thinking this is the best place, close to the 
SS. And every week was all right.  Only one day 

Polish underground tried to kill Kutschera because he was a very bad ma n who killed thousand 

people and sent to death.  On the corner Chopina where the Embassy was and the Polish 

underground took the action.  Kutschera was kille
d.  Many other German was killed and that 
was good for Polish underground. And was not good for the people who was in the baseme nt 

because from this mo ment all blocks was put with the wire around and nobody could go in and 

out from the  building where was hire the Jewish
 two fa mily. Wa s Mr. like I said before and 

second fami ly was only one person Mr. Epstein. 
And was start problem supply the food for the 

people in the baseme nt. And we never go there 
because later there st artWa rsaw uprising and 
the people living in the baseme nt lose the co
ntact. We  know from ot
her people later after 
Warsaw uprising the people survived allWarsaw uprising and go to scourge (?) because after 

Wa rsaw collapsed the Ge rmans took all people out fromWa r saw and go to checkpoint in 

Geraldof or near the border ofWa rsaw and sele
ct. And because these pe ople was very, very 
weak and white color the Germ
an SS recognize the people was Jewish andWa rsaw uprising 
mean the ma rch fromWa rsaw was only family La
ndau, son and mother and father. The other, 

Mr. Epstein, was probably like some  people think was killed by Landau family. 
 
Q: By Landau family? 

 

A: Because was not enough food and water. This 
I don™t know.  I was not there.  People told to 
me , only I know the corpse, the body of Mr. Epstei
n still in the baseme nt inWa rsaw on Chopina 
corner and probably nobody know are buried in the ba
sement there. That™s story I heard after I 
come  back to Poland fromAmerican army and I talked to people who survived theWa rsaw 

uprising. That was three fa mily, nice people who 
we tried help. And I think so we did, people 
ask me  why you did this.  First we are Christians
 and in our religion if we have chance help 

some body, we do.  Not me .  I a m love all Jewish
 people like Mr. Kahana or Mr.We iss from 

York, I not like him. And still if the fellow be
 on edge of the cliff probably I give him help.  
That™s I did in 1943, ™44. That was about helpin
g people in very brutal 
situation.  My personal 
what you like know more, personal; expe
rience in a concentration camp?  
 

Q: First of all theWa rsaw uprising. 

 

A: Wa rsaw uprising probably you have more, you have
 tomorrow or today you talk to my brother 
who was longer in theWa rsaw uprising.  Because 
we was divided, our family, two really three 
groups.  My brother, younger brother, was in mi
ddleWa rsaw and what was in the group what 
was fighting with the Germans and still was the 
special commando.  Myself and my father we 
was all the time home, army and we support, we 
hire you know all paper for print or stuff like 
this and we give money for underground organizati
on. And afterWa rsaw uprising start, in our 
factory, our building, was all ammu
nition and the sharp rifles, pist
ol, and so me thing else. And I 
never know that our group was so big b
ecause I know only two, 
three people around me  
because all organization was do designed I know
 only couple people.  My father know only 
couple people. We  neve r know big circle the pe
ople. And after theWa rsaw uprising start our 

ma gazine was opened. And was so ma ny peopl e asked for and has title to ammunition and 

pistol or  some thing. Wa s fifty percent w
ithout some  gun, a mmunition, some  grown-up or 
some thing like this. That was 175 Kilinski ba ttalion and the first day we wa s ready without the 

guns. Wa rsaw uprising was very,very much cost 
our life, our people.  
The best people was 
dying.  Quarter million pe ople died duringWa rsaw uprising, the best. 
 

Q: When did you join the re
sistance, the underground? 
 

A: We  was already two years before in ?? 

 

Q: So 1942 you– 

 

A: ™40,  ™40,  ™42 I was already. 

 

Q: And what about your father? 

 

A: My father was all the time  and that was the 
second group we was in near our factory. And my 
intention was after I not receive gun, I was tr
aining because during the 1939 I was doing couple 
months with army. And I was very upset, I ha
ve no gun. Wh at kind of soldier if I have no gun, 
nothing. And the special youngest people was so 
aggressive and was against the Germans took 
everythi ng what was in our baseme nt location.  
That was not belong to 
this place too.  In our 
building and not belong to us wa
s to the group Kalinski battalion. 

 
Q: That was your unit? 

 

A: My unit. And later I took, you know, because I 
was ?   I mean build bridges, destroye d bridges 
or something like this, I was start with the fortif
ication there. And I wa
s very upset during the 
whole Wa rsaw uprising. 
 

Q: Why?  

 

A: Why?   Because I was thinking is
 too much cost our life and we  
have gained very little. Why 
was my thinking this way?   Because young pe
ople who never was in the war don™t know 
nothing how the war looked. And 1939 I was in 
Polish army, I know the Russian army, and I 
know the German ar my going from the east toWa
rsaw. And special during the Hitler time  in 
Wa rsaw, ™39,  ™44 I was thinking this is fighting w
ith the so big colors, people, so big army, we 
had no chance. And Russian army asked Polis
h underground start figh
ting with German in 
1944, and after we start fighting the Russians ne
ver helped us and never asked again start 
fighting with Germans. That was my think. And 
our group I lose couple of
 friends in the action 
and we was in the old part of theWa r s aw. And 
after the part ofWarsaw was collapsed we were 
supposed to go through the Commouse (? ) below 
the ground to the mi ddle part of theWarsaw 
should ? misht(? )  in. And we never caused this
 because we was left?  gr oup was going to ?  us 

and prevent German goi ng from the ghetto, this 
area, to however place where we was there.  
And after last mo me nt the Commouse was destr
oyed because Germans put the? in the?We had 
no chance to go to (? ) joint with 
the other part of theWa rsaw 
underground, uprising unit. And I 
went to my mother house and we took our clot
hes what we was fighting and we changed for 
civilian clothes. And that was couple hours. After couple hours I only 
eat, dress, wash my 
hands, and took the other clothes and German st
art screaming and the whole house rouse.  In 
other words we must go out from the  baseme nt 
and we must go to outside. And we did this. 
 

Q: Who are you now, who are together? 

 

A: And we me e t  together, my mother, my 
two sister, and the same  time, my father. 
 

Q: Did he take his uniform off, too? 

 

A: My father was not in unifor m.  

 

Q: So he was not fighting? 

 

A: Fighting, yes, organized everythi
ng there.  Based Fabricant (?) where is our factory. That was 
very active ma n.  Only was not, was forty couple 
years old, and was not fi
ght with what, with 
stone. You cannot fight with 
stone. And was not enough guns, ammunition, etc. Wa s  ma ybe 
20 % people with guns and the other was doing not
hing.  In mi ddle part of theWa rsaw was 
better organized. 
 

Q: Where your brother was? 

 

A: Ye s, that was better prepared for this. A
nd after this mo ment we go out from the basement 
where we lived. We  lived close to the ------- in
 our house was the church. And we go out from 
the baseme nt and (?) and up and search and we we
nt couple miles by foot to the point where we 

was sent to train and from tr
ain to some  special big barrack
s and we was select there to 
concentration camp.  During the march from our 
house to the place where we was sent to the 
railroad was very bad mome nt because ma ny Ukr a inian pe ople work for Germans and was very, 
very molested situation.  My mother cannot 
take the ring, gold ring from the finger and the 
fellow like cut my mother fi nger. 
 

Q: She cut it? 

 

A: Like cut. And the German soldier said wh
at you doing stupid?  And le
t my mother go because 
this old lady cannot take this. And from this
 mo me nt we go to Krushkuff near theWa rsaw.  
That was big old railroad factory and we sleep there one night and we supposed to go 

some place. And we were selected, ol d peopleon one side, young people on other. And my 

mother was sent on side with th
e old people and my father and 
my mother said no, I not leave 
my children, I go together. And go with us to 
gr oup where was selected 
to concentration camp. 
That™s my mother went to concentration camp. 
 

Q: Where did the other group go? 

 

A: The other group go free. The others go some place where we don™t know and was old people 
was free, sixty, seventy years 
old, fifty or under. Young people 
was sent on one side and was 
selected to concentration camp. This was first 
part where German took oldWa rsaw. This time 
the fighting army was (?) was called by German 
l i ke bandit, not fighting people for freedom,  
like bandit.  Later there the International Red Cr
oss and other sources press the German and the 
fighting army was equal to prisoner of war.  
I was not so lucky, I go to concentration camp. 
 

Q: Do you remember when your fa mily was arrest
ed?   Before the battle was finished, right? 
 

A: You mean before theWa rsaw uprising?  That 
was I think about the first of September.  Later 
there we go to the pl ace and again this was not 
so lucky because we was in Prushkof the whole 
fa mily with me , the father, two sister, and me
 was in Prushkof, the old factory. And we 
supposed to go to some place we don™t know yet at 
this time. And I talked to oneAustrian 
fellow withAustrian insi gnia in German ar my
 because I speak German.  I asked him listen, 
what we can do, we must go from here, and my 
mother is sick. And the fellow said, ma ybe I 
can help you and said, you can go out if you pa
y some  money in gold. And we have the gold 
with us because nobody said (?). And I give 
for each person twenty gold dollars. And was 
everything prepared. We  must go through physician 
and select like sick people. And one hour 
after I talk to this fellow so
me  start ﬁboomﬂ  there and SS st
art screaming, shrying and ma ke 
noise, everybody out. Why?   Because from Re d 
Cross International, Re d Cross from Sweden 
and Switzerland, people supposed to see how Germ
an treat the people afterWa rsaw uprising.  
And we was  pressed going up to the doctor, we 
was lying to the doctor, and we was take out, 
kick and push and put in the cars, co
w cars, how do you call the transport? 
 

Q: Cattlecars. 

 

A: Right and we was pushed there for so ma ny peopl
e.  How many can go in?  And the train goes.  
And was two weeks.  I not reme mber exactly -- 
wa s long time . We  go from one place to other 
and nobody like take us.  Because al
l concentration camps was  full. 
And after all, we go so 
long around Germany, we went in
 concentration camp Flossenburg. 
 

Q: Did they feed you when you were on the train? 
 

A: Ve ry little.Ve ry little, and we have w
ith us–.really I don™t reme mber, I know we have 
some thing to eat, our stuff because we took fr
omWa rsaw s o me thing.  Nobody take from us 
nothing. 
 

Q: Whataboutwater? 

 

A: With water was not so good. With water I was sick
 after it. All transport I was very sick to the 
stomach.And I was thinking I die, because why I st
ay in the transpor t.  I was like usual very 
stupid family man.  I was thinking family that is
 some thing what is not breakabl e.  Because was 
two young sister, my mo ther and my father.  
I was thinking I am the most  powerful young 
fellow and I have not other obligation, I must 
help my fa mily.  Special I was taught by my 
father and mother.  My fa ther and mother was f
our years inWorldWar First in working camp in 
Germany and said to us, because we was family
 we survived. And going to Germany with my 
fa mily I was thinking the same .  I a m the youngest 
fellow, powerful.  I supposed to help and I 
help because I know my  character. A
nd happened was not working place only was 
concentration dead camp where we was there and 
selected, wome nTheresienstadt and me n stay 
in Flossenburg. And after the w
hole transport we go fromWarsaw
 by this car. If I have not 
obligation to my fa mily I go hundred times escape because was not so bad.  During night I can 

jump because was open.  I can do this.And I cannot jump and go and lift my mother who was 

fifty years old and my father and two young gi
rls. And that was 
the reason I landed in 
concentration camp. Aft e r we arrived on Flossen
burg I was thinking I die. After we stopped in 
one place before Flossenburg,We iden I asked the fellow who was on the train, gi ve me hot 

water a little bit because I am very sick.  I sp
eak German and the fellow said fine, I give you.  
And give me the steam, after one mi nute there wa
s water from the steam.  And I  drink ma ybe 
one a little this and that™s what probably helped
 me . And fr om this mo ment the locomotive was 
changed and to this transport the locomotive wa
s connected with SS people.  Because SS people 
only go to concentration camp with the transport. 
 

Q: So before then these were German army? 

 

A: German railroad me n.  Railroad me n was like ar
my during the war. And we went there to 
concentration camp, Flossenburg and there was so
 nice sign ﬁArbeit Macht Freiﬂ me a n during 
the work you can be free. And there was the 
selection, wome n on one side, me n on the other.  
And start the problem like you 
know all concentration camp has.  Each day some thing new, 
each day people were killed.  People was pushed from the stone, steinbruk from hundred twenty 

feet high.  On the top, you know, somebody push you 
to the bottom.  People from the first 
mome nt was selection who is engineer on one 
side, who is physician on other side, and these 

people who was high educated was killed first,
 not by bullet, by walking up to knee in the 
water, very bad condition.And people who work a
ll time hard and has hard life was prepared to 
this. The intelligent people was not prepare
d.  Each day was some body from our group to die, 
die. And was so ma ny di seases and was terrib
le.  From our transport, I reme mber some body 
took the numbers, over three a
nd a half thousand people come
 back only one hundred eighty 
three people back.  Between the bad people was 
two friendlyAmerican boys who supplied to 

Wa rsaw through the air ammunition and guns wa
s shot by German and landed close to our 
house Mirdova and went with us together to 
concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to 
Flossenburg what I visit couple years ago are ho
w ma ny Polish people died there, was mostly 
died Polish, Russian, very small Jewish and two 
Americans. They died in Flossenburg.  Help 

Polish people. And till concentration camp terri
ble, was very bad, and our camp was governed 
by criminals, not only SS criminals, and German 
criminals. We political because fr omWarsaw 
operation was political. We  were 
called political prisoners. We  was 
with the red triangle and P.  
The other Ge rman prisoner, the bandits, was with
 green.  Other color, some  Jewish was blacks 
(? ) star. And I tell you one thing, in concentr
ation camp I never thinkpeople the prisoner was 
very friendly each other and never, never I sa
w or (? ) you re Polish or you are Jewish or you 
are, for example, French. Wa s not so, people 
think was very bad atmosphere. We  never had 
bad experience, for example, with French, Jewish, Russian, the same . We  was prisoner. We  

experienced the same problem and that™s the st
ory in concentration camp.  Many things I can 

point out to you about the concentration camp 
because it was a very brut al mo me nt and 
depressed.  How ma ny t i me s you go do some th ing some body push you, the SS or kapo.  Kapo 

mostly was in our concentration camp was German 
prisoners, sadist. And 
some  was Jewish too.  
And I cannot say the prisoner was some thing one agai
nst the other.  In my  camp was like I said 
before, General Kenaus was killed and all generals, It alian generals who was against Hitler and 

Mussolini this time, the 
group called General (??) people, gene
rals, age 60-70 was treated very, 
very badly by not only German, by the prisoners
, I don™t know why, the people must have died 
there.  Because was something this time  I di
d not understand.  In my eye one general was not 
killed and was very, very bad wounded by one 
criminals and took a chair and punch the chair 
on the head. And each day was terrible. And pr
oblem was theAppel.  It was theAppel and 
some body was mi ssing because di ed already and 
where is the body, for example, because on 
Appel we must count the body and live people. 
That some times takes two hours, three hours 
before every numbers come  together.  I hope I 
can tell you more.  Many friends from my town, 
from this group, 3,000, died, because there wa
s not enough eat, was not
 enough medicine.  I 
was very lucky, I got some  in hospital. And my
 father, special, helped many Polish people give 
some  me dicine, ma ybe not help too much and sti
ll help some . After war was end some  Russian 
people, in this concentration camp wa s 5,000 Russi
an army officers, and this people was stoned 
one guy (??) who was very brutal, beat my father
 once very badly, and this Russian (?) took the 
gun becauseAmerican army give us the gun.  Shoot
 if you think so some body is, give it to hi m. 
Shoot him.  Nobody from Polish group shoot no
body. The Russian a good ma ny, many, ma ny. 
 

Q: You me ntion your father was ba
dly beaten. Wh y was he beaten? 

 

A: Beaten for no reason, no reason at all. We  go w
ith my father to theAppel Place what we have 
title to do and Lagerfuhrer go against us and fo
r no reason punch my father in nose and start 
kicking.  I was shocked. What I can do?  And 
my father wake up and said excuse and we go 
together and my father and said, listen these 
people can kick me  or anybody can.  No reason. 
 

Q: So how did you survive?   Looking back
 what are the reasons for your survival? 
 

A: My reason for survival I think was the connect
ion with friend who was from beginning help us, 
Jan Shienitski because this fellow looked after 
us.  If I have nobody there I am sure I die.  
Besides this I was young, 23, 24 years old.  I 
was good sportsma n, my body was built good and 
I was feed good before the uprising. We  eat, 
some  people has not food, not enough food or not 
good food and these people die fast. That wa
s the reason.And besides this reason was my 
mother was, I feel, during my sitting in concen
tration camp, each evening I prayed to the God, 
if some body must die, better me  because I am al
one, not my mother, not my sisters, not my 
father because my father has obligations to family
, my mother obligation to sist ers. All time I 
pray. After I come back from camp, my mother
 said each day I prayed to God the same.  Let 
take me, I am the oldest woman and save th
e children.  Probably some thing helped us. 

 
Q: Some body answered your prayers. 

 

A: Yeah, that I think. And one thing more in th
e concentration camp if I 
can me ntion you, I was in 
the revier (?)  mean the hospital and my bed wa
s very close to on the ot
her side of the other 
room was (?).  People, die people, after some bod
y died, the clothes was 
taking out and the dead 
people was laying on the floor, they took the other 
before, dentists take their teeth. And listen, 
behind the wall ma ybe couple hundred corpse there and one day was some  shooting from the 

tower, one of the tower near the crematorium 
whe r e I lived was shooting and the bullets go all 

over and we was be killed.  Only the corpse of
 the dead people catch the bullets, not me . And 
what happened, next day we check what happened.  Some  Russian prisoner go to the 

Lichencome r mean the morgue, go there and pi ck 
up the gold teeth, stealing 
the gold teeth from 
the people. And the fellow who was  on the watc
hing tower saw him and put
 the refl ector, the 
spot there, and start shooting.  
And I was very lucky.  I was be
hind this corpse of the dead 
people. 
 

Q: So they were shooting into your barracks 
because the Russians had stolen the gold and you 
were saved by the piles of bodies. 
 

A: That™s right. 

 

Q: Any other miracles? 

 

A: Not ma ny kinds on the fight.  I not fight in my
 life too much and during the concentration camp 
I fight with fe llow the same  age like me . Th
is was Russian Communi
st young officer who all 
(? ) said don™t worry, Pole, Poland never be free. 
 Be seventeenth Russian Republic. And I was 
very patriotic.  I said you crazy, you stupid, Po
land be free again. And we start fighting. And 
each couple day was the same . And I  never fight w
ith other pe ople.  I fight with him. And now 
after so ma ny years my fight was right, Po
land is free, Russian Communists is dead. 
 

Q: Is that a good time to end? 

 

A: No, I think so. We  got much more time, I think so now.  I was not prepared for 
this–..select–.. 
 

Q: We ll the rest we can get fromyour book about your experiences. 

 

A: I am glad this going to some museum and sp
ecial the Holocaust Museum and I be glad it be 
placed there and this way we know was not only Je
wish people killed in Holocaust, was French, 
Polish, Russian, Zigoinen (gypsies) and ma ny othe
rs. And ma ny people like me  Christian also 
suffered from the topalistic (?) German 
fanatic and Russian Co
mmunist dictator.  
 

Q: One final question, when did you come  toAmerica? 

 

A: 1961. 

 

Q: After you got ma rried? 

 

A: Ye s, with two children. And I am gl ad because so much Polish people suffer and we think we 

must create for our children be
tter life, not only economically, 
free country, one of the fa mous 
free country and we are glad th
at we are here. And my fath
er was dreaming going toAmerica 
1914. And going toAmerica by boat fromWa rs aw 
to Gdansk and start break war, war fast. 
 
Q: And he never tried again? 

 

A: Never tried again. We was inAmerican zone.  
We  can stay there.  I was part of army and I go 
for one month to Poland and I come  back to border green and was shooting and so on.  I go to 

Poland because my sisters and my mother was 
in Poland and I know I like take from Poland 
three and bring to United St ates and go to German
y. Wa s not possible because my mot her said I 

am so weak, I cannot go.  My sisters said we stay with mother.  I come  back to my fat her, to 

Germany.  My father decide if so I go there.  
And after one year later I go back to Poland and I 
was fifteen waiting for possibility to go to United St ates. 
 

Q: Did your father -- he never went toAmerica? 

 

A: No, died before I went.

A: In Poland. Ye s and I had with my father 
very good relationship a
