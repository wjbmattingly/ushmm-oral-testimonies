REGINA LAKS GELB 
February 20, 2001
 
 
 
Q: Goodmorning. 
 
A: Goodmorning.   
 
Q: It™s lovely to see you here this morning. 
 
A: Well, I™m delighted that you came 
and ma de this long trip. [Laughs] 
 
Q: Can you start out by just giving me  the name
 that you were born with and the name  that 
you live with now, please?  
 
A: Okay, my real, official, legal name  is Regi
na born Laks. I also went by the name  of Renia 
throughout my life, so actually I™m s till bei
ng called Renia, but if you want to find the 
legal me , you will find it always under Regina, wh
ether it™s school or professional life or 
however or legal or - everyt
hing is Regina. My present name is Gelb; I™m married to 
Victor Gelb, so I basically never use m
y, my mai den name, which some people did 
retain. I did not, so my name  is really now Regina Gelb. 
 
Q: And when were you born and where? 
 
A: I was born December 16
th
, 1929 in a place called Wi erzbni
k, which you could not find 
anymore on the ma p now because it has been jo
int to anot her town called Starachowice 
and rename d. It was basically incorporate
d. And if I know history of the town, the 
incorporation - the towns were 
joined in 1931, -9, just before 
the war, so that first these 
towns were adjacent basi cally, one was sort 
of a factory town and the other was the 
bedroom town. Wi erzbnik was the bedroom 
town and the Je wish community re ally 
resided in Wierzbnik rather than St arachow
ice. And I was born in Wi erzbnik and, as I 
said before, if you want to find it on the ma
p, you will not. You will only ha ve to look for 
the name  Starachowice, so that™s where it 
is and it is central Poland, south of Wa rsaw 
about two hours by car.  
 
[Phone interruption.] 
 
Q: I want you to do me  a favor for a second. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I want you to close your eyes for a mi nute 
and think about what come s to your - then you 
can open them again - what come s to mi nd 
when you first think about your childhood?  
What™s the picture that you get 
in your head about your childhood?  
 
A: Could I open my eyes now?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Q: Yes. 
 
A: Well, basically a very carefree life, becau
se I was a young child, and the second is that I 
was sort of privileged, more than my sist
ers were privileged by virtue of being the 
youngest. I was sort of the baby in the fa
mily. As you know, the third one in line 
some ti me s gets mi streated by the older ones, not
 that I was, but I ce
rtainly was spoiled by 
my parents because I was what you call the 
baby in the family, and anythi ng around the 
idea of being privileged is not, does not include
 being spoiled; it™s 
just being singled out 
for being special, it™s more or less. I was fore
ver being told I was smart and I was this and 
that and it actually served me
 very well in later years dur
ing the hard time s because I 
always had the idea that I really could do certa
in things because I wa
s always told, ﬁWell 
you™re was smart and you do well in school.ﬂ An
d you– So that later on I could rely on 
this idea that was lodged in my head, whic
h, well, today, I think 
they have all the 
euphemi s ms -  self-whatever it™s called toda
y, self-appreciation, or 
whatever, the fact 
remains that because I was a) singled out by my parents for being a very good child and 

smart child and for being given this, this, impe
tus to build on that, I think I more or less 
relied on it in later years, I mean, you 
know, during the hard time s, saying, well, I 
probably could do it because I was told that I re
ally could do it, so let me  just do it. And 
that™s probably the single most i mportant aspe
ctof my me mory of 
what I brought out of 
that, of my c hildhood, out of my childhood. 
 
Q: Do you think that was true for your 
two older sisters, Chris and Hania?   
 
A: Well, I really don™t know. I couldn™t te
ll you for sure for the reason that, you know, 
Hania was always the, what you call the brillia
nt one in the family and she was out of 
town, in a special high school for the gifted 
and whatever, and Krysia was the gorgeous, 
the gorgeous, the beauty of the fa mily, youknow, and I had no assets, you know, I had no 

such things to prove. So this is another 
aspect of it, you know, that Hania was always 
spoken of the genius of the fa mily, which she really was absolutely, and Kr ysia was 

really striki ngly beautiful, I mean, she wasn™t
 just pretty, she was 
strikingly beautiful. 
And I™m always saying this, I™m repeating it 
forever because it™s a 
fact, if Mother was 
walking, let™s say, in the stre
et with Krysia, with Chri
s, and people would stop and 
everybody would say ﬁOh, what a beauty!ﬂ And 
Mother said, ﬁYou can™t say that because 
she would get it into her head that she™s so b
eautiful, she wouldn™t have
 to ma ke an effort 
in life.ﬂ But the fact remain
s that, you know, I always felt 
well, if my parents say I™m 
smart, I mus t  be smart or whatever, because
 there was nothing to be said about me . I 
wasn™t very, exactly very pretty and I don™
t think I was a genius, so– And I had these 
teeth, you know, my teeth were uneven sort of
, and I was skinny, so that I didn™t present 
anything so outstanding as to 
be pegged one way or another. However, you see, whether 
this was an excuse that I took the fact that
 I was supposed to be smart, or whatever, I 
really built on that idea. I abso
rbed it and I lived with it a
nd I built on it, so for better or 
worse, it really, it really did 
come  in handy in later years.

Q: Were you close with both of your parents?  
 
A: Very, we were an extremely close family, 
and not just with my parents, but with my 
mother™s si de  of the family, because  they liv
ed very near, within twenty - whether it™s 
twenty miles or twenty kilome ters, I don™t 
know. Grandmother lived in Ostrowiec, which 
is a town very near. Father™s family came from Si lesia from Sosnowiec, and that was 
further, much further out, was western Po
land; whereas Starachowice and Ostrowiec 
were in central Poland, because Mother™s family came from Sa ndomi erz, which is 

slightly to the south of Ostrowiec and St
arachowice, so basically Grandma and my 
mother™s family lived within the area righ
t, you know, how far back the family went, I 
don™t know, but I do know Mother was born in Sa ndomierz, and subsequently the family 

lived in Ostrowiec and my mother was married 
in Ostrowiec. In fact, after the war, when 
I went to visit Ostrowiec - Mother used to
 say that she was married on the balcony - and 
when I went back to Ostrowiec to look at
 it, of course, the houses were during 
Communist time in Poland and the building 
was extremely had the dilapidated look, you 
know. The outside walls were sort of sha
bby and peeling but the balcony was there, it 
was a corner balcony and Mother said they put the huppah out there, because, you know, 

my grandfather was religious, so that, I imag
ine, to satisfy his requireme nts, the huppah 
was outside on the balcony, and so I found, yes, 
that was interesting, the building is still 
there. 
 
Q: What was your father li
ke and what did he do?  
 
A: My father was, well, you know, I shouldn™
t be saying that, but you know they describe 
German Jews as 
Jekes
. My father was basically from
 Silesia and brought up, under the, 
under, you know, western Poland was occ
upied by Germany. You know, Poland was 

partitione d in the 18
th
 century, so that the western pa
rt of Poland was taken over by the 
Germans, the south was taken over by Austro-H
ungary - Austria, actually - and the rest  
was taken out by Russia. Now, my mother 
happened to come  from the Russian quote-
unquote zone. It™s not a zone, but you know, Ru
s s ian sphere of influence; whereas my  
father, having been born in Sosnowiec and 
grown up in Silesia, spoke German language, 
went to German schools and really was this very
 organized, straight, 
very precise type of 
ma n, which they describe as a 
Jeke
, you know, whereas, you know, this is in no way 
derogatory, never.. Wha t  I meant to say that he
 was really very much German, rather than 
Polish sort of thing, but of course he spoke
 Polish beautifully. And 
he was an engineer– 
 
Q: Let me  ask you some thing– 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: –abouthispersonality. 
 
A: Yes. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Q: Wa s he a man filled with humor? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was he very serious? 
 
A: No, he was serious but, you know, there wa
s a lot of singing. I reme mber that. There wa s 
a lot of singing going on in the 
house all the time . In fact, I 
understand that my - whether 
my mother only or both parents participat
ed in - oh, you know, it wasn™t what you call 
official, big theatre, but th
ere were the amateur groups, 
because I know my  mother™s 
brother, my uncle Morris - Moish - he was 
very much involved in amateur theatrical 
group and I know parents had a little contac
t with that, but what I do know for an 
absolute fact is that my father always s
ung in the house, I me an, he loved Lehar. So, 
when I hear ﬁThe Merry Wi do
wﬂ, I always, but forever, a
ssociate it with my father 
because all certain arias fr om ﬁThe Merry Wi
dowﬂ were his absolute favorite. You could 
always hear him sing, and my 
mother, too. Whether this is different now because there 
are radios and televisions a
nd all this and there isn™t much talking at home or singing 
whatever, ma ybe people sing in the shower, 
I don™t know, but I do know that there was 
just singing, as you walked around the house or whatever, you were singing and so my 

father was one of these who really kept on si
nging and not for any audience; for hims elf. 
Mother, too. 
 
Q: I understand that at least Krysia and, 
I don™t know, ma ybe Hania and you also sang 
with– 
 
A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we did. 
 
Q: –with them.  
 
A: Yes, because, you see, singing was so natural 
in those days. As I said, you didn™t rely on 
any outside - I mean, a circus came  to tow
n, you know, or some thing like that - but there 
was never what you call, there was never a regul
ar theater or there wa
s never an opera. It 
was a small town, you see, so that basically people just organized their own entertainment 

and I was too young to really know, to have 
even gone if there was one. I would never 
have gone. In fact, I reme mber that even to go to the movies, we were, you know, the 

laws were so strict, a child could not go to
 movies unless it was a Shirley Temple movie 
or some thing. I reme mb er going to Shirley Temp
le movies, but I never ever went to the 
movies otherwise because they wouldn™t have le
t me  in. That was, yes, and, this is why - 
as I said, there was no official theater or, 
but there was entertainment provided by people 
who lived there and I, of course, our fa mily 
being Jewish, in this particular respect, you 
should not associate our Jewish family with th
e religious pa rt of town because that was a 
little frowned upon, you know. We  lived a more s
ecular - not more - we
 did live a secular 
life; whereas the religious Jews in town lived
 a totally different life, as you could see it 
even in New York these days, I mean, you go to Williamsbur g, or you go to Eastern 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Parkway where the Lubavitch live, and you 
immediately see that
, if you belong to a 
reformed synagogue as we do, it really is not th
e way we lived life, and we still could feel 
as Jewish as they do and I™m sure as d
eeply identified with ﬁJewishnessﬂ but not 
necessarily religious ﬁJewishnessﬂ to the ex
tent, because we are not observant and our 
home - at home in Poland - my grandmother 
was very religious so 
in order for her to 
come  and visit, Mother had to keep a kosher 
home , but we were not necessarily kosher in 
any strict sense of the word. 
 
Q: So even though you were a child–  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you understand - I know that you we
nt to your Grandma because she was very 
concerned that you weren™t gett
ing a proper Jewish education. 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
 
Q: But was, did your father come from a  more
 secular home and is that why your home was 
so secular?  
 
A: I think so, I really couldn™t tell you, I rea
lly truly couldn™t tell 
you. All I know is that 
Grandmothe r basically, the grandmother herself 
did not come  from a religious fa mily, or 
ma ybe she did, because  she was very well educated. And for a 19
th
 century woman to 
know French and German and be fluent in la
nguages is sort of unusual. She came fr om a 
good fa mily. But she ma rried my grandfather, 
who was very religious, and then she wore 
a wig. Yes, so I have one picture, which I 
have given to the Museum, where there™s a 
fa mily picture with Grandma in the mi ddle,
 and you could see that she is wearing a 
sheitel
 and whether she did it because – Maybe it
 was an arranged ma rriage. I mean, I 
really don™t know. This is a
ll speculation, but I do say th
at I have never known my 
grandfather, but I was very clos
e to my grandmother. And she 
used to invite one child at 
the time , in the summer, to spend a week with her. So, she did the 
Baruch Atah
 (ph) at 
the breakfast and she taught us how to pray 
at night but, you know, she felt she needed to 
supplement what was mi ssing in our education be
cause we - I, personally - went to public 
school, Polish public school, and I also went 
to the Tarbut He brew school after school, 
which was a Zionist organized - Mother was,
 you know, president of
 WI ZO, and through 
her effort the Tarbut was organi
zed. In fact, my s i ster Hania, Anna, remi nded me  that the 
teacher who was hired to run the Hebr ew sc
hool in our town, a Mr. Wopata (ph), was 
brought over by my mother, and he lived in ou
r apartment, in our home, until they found 
lodgings for him. So, you see, 
that in no way it disparages 
the religious group. It™s just 
that there wa s a segment of population in 
Starachowice - Wi erzbnik, meaning Wi erzbnik 
because we are talking be fore the war - th
ere was a segment of the population which was 
more, it was secular; not detached from Judaism,
 but detached from the strict observance, 
because, you know, the religious gr oup, the Hassidim, had their own schools for girls, 
Beth Jacob, and of course they had the 
heder -
 the 
heder,
 that goes wit
hout saying. There 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
6 
 
was a 
heder
, and there was a girl. None of us went
 to any of these schools, you see, so I 
went to Polish public school and to the He
brew Tarbut after, 
you know, after my school 
was out, after my Polish school was out. So 
it didn™t separate us from the Jewish 
population, but we were not pa
rt of that other life. 
 
Q: Was there a good percentage of the Jewish
 population who were more like you than were 
religious, or was it a rea
lly tiny group?  Do you know?  
 
A: Really, I couldn™t tell you, 
but I do know a lot of people on my parents level who were, in 
fact some  of them were survivors and I™ve ke
pt in touch with them, and so there were, 
you know, they were sort of what they used to 
call ﬁintelligentiaﬂ, whic
h is sort of, I don™t 
know. I use the expression for the lack of bette
r description because I don™t mean in any 
way to show this group to be superior to th
e other group. It™s just 
that this was the less 
observant group, no less religious, and the f
act that my mothe r  was so extremely, 
extremely devoted to the cause of crea ting, you know, the Zionist moveme nt, the... 
helping along the pioneers who had gone to Israel
, excuse me, to Palestine in those days.  
 
Q: What was she like? What  kind of woma n–?   
 
A: Very vivacious, extremely vivacious, qui ck moving, quick thinking and lively, lively, 
very lively. Father was livel
y, too, but in a more serious way. Mother was very vivacious 
and the–well, her outstanding characteristic wa
s that she was really very–altruistic isn™t 
the word, she was very concerned with othe
rs. She always did for others, one way or 
another, she did for others, you know. Ther
e was a - I reme mb er there was a flood, 
some where in Poland, I really don™t know, but
 I do reme mber that there was money be ing 
collected in the community - not Jewi sh co
mmunity - for the cause, to help the flood 
victims. And I reme mbe r  she ma de me  a boat out of cardboard, because we went through 

the streets for donations, and I wore that boa
t, now, I don™t know where the flood was and 
I don™t know how that was all organized. I just 
reme mber walking around with this, like a 
ship ma de out of cardboard with _____, you 
know, and people would put in coins and 
that was the collection, so in 
retrospect when I think about 
it, and you know, all this idea 
of the Jewish population living parallel liveswith the Polish populat
ions but not mi ngling 
doesn™t always hold true , because I™m sure th
is was not a Jewish flood, and I still don™t 
know where the flood was, but I do distinctly
 reme mber as a child walking around with 
this boat, where people, it was like on 
a ribbon, you know, I had it 
attached on a ribbon, 
and people would put in money for the flood vict
ims. So you see, to me , that is, this is 
already an indication that 
people who claim that there 
was absolutely no connection 
between the Christian Poles and the Jewish 
Poles doesn™t hold true because, in our 
personal lives, I know for a fact
 that we were very close 
to Christians, to Christian 
fa milies, some  of whom saved our lives late
r on, but that™s another st ory. But when we 
talk about the flood, this is a 
general, a more general overv
iew of things, and much as 
there was anti-Semitism on another ki nd of level, but ther e had to be coexistence, that , 

you know, supplied some  kind of a living arrange
me nt if nothing else, so– but of course 
we got off t he subject, I don™t know how, we did–

Q: That™s okay. Your father was a fo
restry engineer is that correct? 
 
A: Yes,yes. 
 
Q: Did you know what he was doing?  
 
A: No, I just knew that he - the fi rst time 
I heard the word ‚logarithm™ , was that he was 
working with logarithms. I don™t know if itwas a machine, but anyhow I found that it 
was the figuration, not a figurati
on, assessments of forestry, because he used to travel to 
eastern parts of Poland, where there were h
eavy forests, virgin forests and he would 
assess, you know, he would assess the forest  for the lumber industry and that was 

engineering and - I - it wa s engineering for 
which there was another Polish word, but I 
don™t know the English word, but that was his 
occupation. He was, as I told you, he was 
educated in the German language and I imagine German in those days carried a heavy 

weight in the scientific fi eld, so he, I™m 
sure he had an easy life, easy time of it, you 
know.  
 
Q: Was he away a lot? 
 
A: What?  
 
Q: Was he away from home a great deal, do you reme mber?  
 
A: No, no, those were short trips, because, you know, he was basically employed by, in 
town. There was a sawmi ll owned by Jews, I th
ink they were, I never knew, but I think 
they were from Vienna, or some whe r e but 
the name  was Heller because everybody talked 
about the Heller sawmill. In fact, Hani a remi nded me  that subsequently when the sawmill 

was taken over by the Ge rmans, there were Je
ws from our town who did slave labor in 

the sawmill which some how or other I didn™t exactly, you know– I only reme mber the 

factory, the munitions factory, in
 relation to the labor camps, 
because I™m getting a little 
bit ahead of myself, but I always think of
 war production in the munitions factory, but 
basically the sawmill was also a 
war production, if you really want 
to put it in it™s pr oper 
perspective, I mean, they certainly we ren™
t building, doing lumber for Jews to build 
houses or anything like that, 
so that goes without saying. 
 
Q: Were you wealthy? 
 
A: No, but we were well to do, but not until ju
st be fore the war. That was, you know, during 
the depression, the Heller™s I think sold it, or wh
atever it was, they sold it or they gave it 
up, I don™t know, but I know that Father lost  th
e position and then we had very hard times 
but so did everybody else. 
 
Q: So, how, when you say you were well to do, what, how does that ma nifest itself?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

A: Well I mean, if you look at the old pictures, a
nd you they traveled to 
the Baltic sea to the 
Sopot. My parents have a lot of 
pictures from, ha d a lot of pict
ures from that. I also know 
that Mother had severe arthriti
s and she used to go for cure, for six-week cure and that 
was another very wonderful experience because 
she always took at least one of us. And I 
still have pictures that were 
sent to us from Palestine, 
from Israel, from fri e nds of 
Mother™s who had those pictures from Sopot
 and had pictures from Busko Zdroj which 
was that, that, no, spa and I reme mbe r  going w
ith Mother. In other 
words, what happened 
is one kid we nt to Grandma and two kids we
nt with Mother to Busko Zdroj and the six 
weeks that Mother had treatments there, of
 course, generally weakened her a lot. So, 
when we would come  back, we would 
go in the country, you know, on a farm, on 
some body™s far m and we would stay a week so 
Mother could recover, and I imagine that 
you couldn™t well afford, if you couldn™t afford 
to go to Busko Zdroj every year. In fact, 
you know, during the war when everything was cl
osed off for  Jews, meaning we couldn™t 
travel, we couldn™t go to school and such a
nd such, of course, Mother could not go, I 

mean, not that we could afford it, but 
you know, but I™m saying that because she no 

longer was able to go for her treatme nts, whic
h was sulfur by the way, sulfur baths, and 
she suffered terribly, she– her arthritis was mu
ch worse because, of course, she, she had 
no way of c uring, I mean not curing, you don™t cure
 arthritis, but alle
viating the pain. And 
Busko Zdroj was a very interesting place for a child because  the baths were within a pa rk, 

you see. It wa s, of course, you could not, this
 was not a public park, and they had a band 

shell and they had music - opera, arias - and to
 this day when I hear Tosca, I reme mber 
sitting in Busko Zdroj in front of the band sh
ell listening to the music, yes, it was very 
nice. And, and we stayed in a hotel, which 
was very nearby, because you don™t need to 
cross the road, whatever, street, to go into 
the park for the baths, and I used to go and 
object to the smell because, you know, sulfur
 smells like rotten eggs. And I would go 
with mother and I would hear 
the sound when they set up - 
they used to call it mud, you 
know, those were mud baths basically, so you w
ould - they would turn - there was always 
an attendant and then I sat out 
in a like vestibule type, or wh
atever it was, but I wasn™t 
inside, but I would hear wh
en the sound came out ﬁblotoﬂ 
-that means mu d, mud was 
comi ng - and you know, and I know what they did. The person would be, Mother would 

be in a bathtub, the mud would fill it, they
 would put a wooden crate over the bathtub, 
and throw a sheet over it, so that she was s
ubmer ged in that hot sulfur mu d, after which 
the attendant would take her for a shower a
nd then they would ma ssage her, whatever, on 
the table like, then we would go home - she 
had to go to bed. Those were crude, very 
heavy-handed treatments, but they we re good. 
 
Q: They helped her?  
 
A: Yes, because during the war she was r
eally sick. She couldn™t go anymore , you know, 
since Busko was very near Kielce and that re
quired traveling, and 
there was no traveling 
for Jews.

Q: I want to get, before we get to the wa
r period, I wanted to ask you, up until 1939, what is 
your relationship with y
our sisters? You are–?  
 
A: I™ll tell you right away, from a 
viewpoint of the family type, they really liked me  a lot, 
but I was never included. This is– 
 
Q: [Laughs.] 
 
A: This is– I probably should now refer back 
to what I started at the beginning, that my 
parents, sort of, I always felt my parent
s took pity on me . So they said, ﬁOh, you™re 
smarter than everybody,ﬂ and such, true or fa
lse. I mean, I took it 
for the truth, but the 
fact rema ins that I wasn™t to bothe r, to bothe
r, to bother them, becau
se they were already 
older. I was just to, to be around my parents.
 So, if you went some where, my parents took 
me  along. If they went some where, you know, 
I tagged along. And I even have a picture 
some body s e nt me  from Connecticut. His pare
nts had a New Year™s Eve party and you 
can see my parents and his parents, some  ot
her people and there™s wi
ne on the table, and 
in the mi ddle of everything, I™m the only kid sit
ting there. I™m a little 
ki d, a scrawny, little 
kid, meaning it really reinforces my me mory
 that I tagged along, even though whether I 
enjoyed it or not, I couldn™t say, but I do know 
that I was the special child, so to say, so 
they took me  everywhere, but of course the tr
uth was that they had to take me . [Laughs.] 
 
Q: You know, it™s interesting because Ch
ris is only two years olde r than you. 
 
A:  Right, yes. 
 
Q: But there was - you were the kid to her. 
 
A: Yes. The reason is, I think that Chris is, 
first of all she is th
e middle child, you know. She 
was always very independent
, Krysia was always very 
independent, you know, hands on, 
this and that. I was sort of a 
kid type of, that you had to l
ook after. So Chris - ma ybe she 
felt I was a burden, if she wanted to go a
nd have some  friends, have some good times 
with her friends, why would she bother looking af
ter the kid, if I fell or
 if I didn™t fall of 
whatever?  You know, but of course, we loved 
each other. As you very well know, we are 
the closest fa mily that there is, that there ever was, and that  wasn™t even because we went 
through the war together, th
at we were bound by common horrible experience. But 
because the fa mily was such, that we r
eally were one, even though - and you know, I 
never felt slighted, you know. I just knew 
that, if I™m going to have a good time, it™s 
going to be with my parents or with my own 
pee r s but certainly not 
with Chris and Miles, 
and that was even true during the war, not, w
hy did I say?  Miles, I didn™t say Miles, I 
didn™t mean Miles. I meant Chris and Hania. 
That was even true during the war when the 
refugees from Lodz were sent in. You know, 
there was a group of Jews sent into our 
ghetto. And imme diately the quote ﬁgolden yout
h of Lodzﬂ ended up in the circle of 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
10 
 
Hania and Chris. And they would read poetr
y, and Byron, Lord Byron in translation and 
all this. I sat in the same room, but certainly 
not within the circle. I heard it, I was a non-
participant observer. I was some whe r e in the 
room, but I was not of the group, I was with 
the group, you see?  But that did not in any 
way preclude the terrific devotion that my 
sister had shown me , because I know for a fact
 there were instances during the war that I 

was a goner, and had it not been for them, I woul d never ever have survived. So, you see, 

when push came to shove, and of course 
- but even without 
that, you know, you study 
kids in the family–you know, some  kids– Mayb
e they felt my that parents protected 
me , so they didn™t need to bother. 
 
Q: Let me  just ask you a question. Chris - when I interviewed Chris - she me ntioned 
some thing about you, that she reme mber
ed, you as a child, and I wonder if you 
reme mbered the same  thing. She said you would always pick up new words constantly 

and use them i mme diately, often inappropria
tely, some ti me s not– Do you recall that?   
 
A: Yes, yes. Absolutely, I mean this was really, almost an obsession. This is how I became  a 
transl ator , because it™s so easy for me to 
pick up words and think words. And when I 
came to America, I had no knowledge of E
nglish, but having known some  French and 
Latin before and having fooled around with 
these big words - you see, Polish vocabulary 
contains a lot of words out of Latin, you know- so later on, I - because I really was crazy 

about words as a child, and of course quite often I used to mi suse them, you know, 

mi suse them, but I still used them, wrong or ri
ght or whatever; I stuck them in wherever I 
could. And this is why I had such an easy 
time  wi th English, because it was really a 
ma tter of hearing the pronunciation and lear
ning spelling. But if I read it to myself 
quietly, I could ma ke out the text, because, you 
see, I have found the si
milarities with the 
other languages, and the fact th
at some how or other, my mi nd was oriented to words, 
whatever. So that is true
, she is absolutely right. 
 
Q: So, as you™re growing up - now, you™re bor
n in ™29, so when th
e Nazis take over in 
Germany– 
 
A: I™m 10 years old, no, not in Germany– 
 
Q: –No, ™33 - you™re much younger. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So, between ™33 and ™39, do you hear things
 - I know towards the 
end of ™39, there are 
German Jews that come  into your area, right?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So, do you begin to experience– sense some thing, even if you don™t know what™s 
happening?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
11 
 
 
A: Well, I sensed some thing, but I™ve said it 
so often now, and it trul
y is a fact, I really 
didn™t know very much, I don™t re
ally know, and I keep saying 
it, I mean, it™s repetition 
now until you can™t take it anymore, but the 
fact is I don™t know what my parents knew 
and when they knew it. And I certainly kne
w that time s were rough; I knew that 
some thing was happening in Germa ny. But I also
 knew that there was a fami ne in China, 
you know, so - because there was a fami ne in Ch
ina in the 30s, I think - so that I knew 
that there wa s fa mi ne in China and I knew 
there was something going on in Germany, but 
how that related to my personal life or to us, 
it  was sort  of far-fe
tched. I did begin, during 
the economic times, I did begin to feel certain 
pressures, and I did begin to feel certain 
anti-Semitic, well, direct anti-Semitic references
 to who we were, but that was not on any 
scale - because as a child, 
you know, a child can call you a Je
w and he can call you baldy 
and he can call you any kind rotten name , and 
if you can rationalize to
 yourself within 
that context, you know how kids fight, and– 
So, I was aware of a certain change in 
atmosphere in Poland because I do know now
 from studying histor
y that there was a 
wave of anti-Semitism that was extremely, to the naked eye, it was easy to see, because, 
you know, when I translated - I was worki
ng on Korchuk (ph) a lot, Korchuk™s writing, 
and I translated his works - I realized that
 his only, the only reason for his being removed 
from the position of the good doctor, who read
 poetry and talked about child upbringing 
on the radio in the 30s, that he was remove
d from that position only because of anti-
Se mitism. He was a very progressi ve educat
or , as you know, and a very enlightened man 
and he was a Jew, of course, by birth, but he was very Polish in his upbringing and 

outlook, not Christian, but Polish, and he brought
 all these new ideas to Poland, because 
he studied in England, you know, and he br
ought the new ideas, the new approach to 
child upbringing, because he also wrote st
or ies for children, you know. He wrote books 

about children and books for children. And he
 would read and they would call him the 
ﬁold doctorﬂ, and I know, I used to
 listen to the old doctor, bu
t then I didn™t hear the old 
doctor. In those days, I didn™t know, but I 
now know, that the program - that he was 

removed from the radio program only because he was Jew, because the anti-Semitic, the 

wave of anti-Semitism has progressed to the point where, toward the outbreak of the war, 

it was really almost palpab
le. And all this happened, you know, after Pilsudski died, 
Marshall Pilsudski, who died in 1935, had the idea
 of a federal, federalist state, Poland 
being, including mi norities and such. And after 
he died - of course
 all this I know now 
from studying history - that those who opposed
 him so strenuously were of the national 
right-wing party, and they came into prominence in
 the late 30s, so that the wave of anti-
Se mitism, which actually was given freer re
ign, could basi cally come  to the fore. You 
know, they, ma ybe they weren™t encouraged, but they weren™t stopped. 
 
Q: So, though you know this now– 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: –from reading the history, did you experien
ce the change as being that significant?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
12 
 
A: I experienced - you know, I have spoken about 
this several time s. I have experienced a 
few, a few s uch - well, it was an incident or 
it was rather a sort of a one-two-three kind of 
a happening. For example, I had - I went 
to school. I don™t know if it was 1938 or ™39, 
first day of school, and I had a new teacher. 
 
Q: But this was before the war? 
 
A: Before the war, probably it was 19- No, 
I didn™t go to school in 1939 because September 
is when the war broke out. So, it had to 
be 1938. And I went to school and this was a 
ma le teacher. And he said, ﬁI would like ever
y child to stand up, and tell me  his na me ,ﬂ 
you know, so that he could acquaint hims elf.
 When I stood up, and I said, ﬁMy name is 
Regina Laks,ﬂ he looked up at me  and said, 
ﬁYour name  is not Regina. You go home  to 
your mother and tell her that your name  is Ri
vka.ﬂ (ph) We ll, I was so hurt by it, I never 

forgot it. I always talk about it, always
, always, because I was so very hurt by it. 
Apparently, I have already been feeling other things around me , but they were not as 

personal, in front of a class,
 with brand new kids. That was one incident that rema ined 
with me for a life, for the life, and another was a new fa mily came to live in my 

neighborhood, and I got very friendly with a gi
rl - her name  was Kaya (ph), very lovely, 
lovely. They were educated people, and we used
 to play a lot. She used to come to my 
house; I used to go to her house. And then 
around Passover, and I don™t know what year 
that was. that could have been ma ybe  
1937, because I was a little ki d yet, ma ybe. 
Anyhow, so I said, ﬁWhy don™t we go home  and 
play in my house.ﬂ And she said, ﬁNo, I 
can™t go to play in your house. My mother 
said not to go because it™s Passover and the 
Jews take blood from the children for Passove
r.ﬂ You see, that was a child who probably 
wasn™t anymore than 7 or 8 years old. So, 
those two very personal, very personal, 
encounters stayed with me  for a lifetime. But,
 as I was saying, I still felt part of the 
environment that I grew up in. 
I never felt that the Christians
 were agains t me  or that I 
was against them. I could only see the differe
nce between the Hassidim who didn™t mi x at 
all and didn™t want to mi x, and the Polish 
population. But as far as I was concerned, I 
really felt very much at home  and, you know, 
we spoke Polish only at home. My parents 
knew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if th
ey di dn™t want  us  to know. Of course, my  
father spoke German very well, and Mother 
spoke Russian by virtue of growing up in, 
under the Russian sphere of influence. But 
aside from that, Polish was the language. And, 
in fact, a lot of Christians 
were surprised that we spoke 
without an accent which is 
probably - with a subtext, with a hidden 
subtext, you know, when you got a compli me nt, 
ﬁOh, my goodness, you speak Polish so well!ﬂ Of course, there was a subtext, not that I 

knew it then but I know it now. In other word
s, I was not supposed to speak Polish so 
well and without an accent by virt
ue of being Jewish. But real
ly that didn™t bother me  in 
the sense, in any way. I took it as a complim
ent; I took it as a fact, you see, and I™ve 
never felt in any way angry at 
the Poles or blaming them or, or I never, any animosity. I 
mean, they were people to me , dear people, a
nd those especially who were very dear to 
my parents were very dear to us. And 
I certainly had wonderf
ul friends among the 
Christian children, so that, that issue neve
r came up. And when those two incidents came , 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
13 
 
I took them as separate and detached fr
om the bigger picture, you know, it was on a 
smaller scale, kids™ stuff  
 
Q: But let me  - can I probe this just  a little bit? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was it, that your feelings were, when you - was it humiliation?  Wa s it anger, when 
the teacher said your name  is Rivka what–?  
 
A: Very humiliated, I was not angry. I was– He put me to shame, because my name really 
was not Rivka. It so happens, if you want t
o, you know, give a child a Jewish name , it is 
Rivka - because Regina is really Rivka - but 
I was never, in Tarbut
, in the Hebrew school, 
I had the name  Regina then was Rivka and, but 
I was never ever - I was either Regina or 
Renia, I was never Rivka and to be singled 
out like this, I don™t know. I - school was very 
dear to me  always, and school was everything 
to me , and I was always good in school, so 
I felt always elevated and wonderful about 
the school experience. And this was a very 
harsh and very humiliating kind of experience because I by then knew what it was that he 

was trying to say. He didn™t care about me . 
He perhaps wanted to imply that I was 
camouflaging my Jewishness. Because you see, 
I did not go to the Jewish school; I went 

to the public school. And there weren™t too 
ma ny of us, but there were kids, most 
certainly. So, I sort of felt that I was being humiliated for no reason, and not because  I 

could analyze it in depth. It™s 
just that I knew that Rivka wasn
™t my na me . Regina - if you 
looked, as I said at the beginning, if you l
ooked at any kind of my legal papers or 
otherwise, records or whatever, it™s always
 Regina, not Renia, and its not Rivka, it™s 

really Regina - so that this was my name , I 
was born and given this name . So that, that 
was a double humiliation, as if I were really telling a lie or  so me thing on one hand, or 

ma ybe I was  trying to camouflage some thing which was not the case. 
 
Q: Were there other Jewi
sh kids in the class?  
 
A: Oh yes, certainly, yes, children, absolutely 
 
Q: Did he do the same  thing to them?  
 
A: Not in this particular instance. I don™t
 know, he must have, I don™t know, just me . 
 
Q: And what did the other kids do when he sa
id that? Did they do 
any- Did they laugh, did 
they–?  Nothing?  
 
A: No, and I went home and I told Mother. I said,ﬁHe told me  to tell you 
that this is not my 
name.ﬂ Mother says, ﬁDon™t worry about it.
ﬂ And what was done about it, I don™t know. 
 
Q: Did he ever call you that name  again?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
14 
 
 
A: No, no, he had to call me Regina because that
 wa s in the record. But Mother did feel the 
humiliation I suffered and she said, ﬁAh, doesn™t
 matter, it™s not a big deal,ﬂ whatever it 
was, but I never forgot it. So, it absolutely
 stayed with me  all these years and, you know, 
Chris and Hania, I don™t even know if they 
know about it, in the sense of– I had a few 
incidents in my life, including the Ge rman, th
e war. There were certain little inci dents 
that hurt so much, that were totally insi
gnificant on a larger scal
e, but some how, you 
know, I guess it™s how you, I don™t know, I don™t know
 what is important to you in life or 
whatever. 
 
Q: Right, it™s hard to 
know what it is that _______. 
 
A: Yes, but those, yeah, those two things I ne
ver forgot, the one with the Rivka and with the 
Jews, blood for the ma tzos. 
 
Q: So, what did you say to that little 
girl when she said this to you?   
 
A: No,nothing! 
 
Q: Nothing?  
 
A: Nothing, I said, ﬁNo, you don™t want to come ?  That™s fine. You don™t want to come .ﬂ So, 
she said, ﬁOkay, you come a fter the holidays.ﬂ 
 
Q: So, did you go home  and tell your pa
rents that she said this to you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did they say?  
 
A: They said nothing, ﬁYou don™t even have to play with her because she™s new.ﬂ You 
know, so they said, ﬁWell, you know she™s new.
ﬂ You see, this is the whole point. Our 
parents, especially with rega
rds to me - I cannot speak fo
r Chris and I cannot speak for 
Anna, Hania, I cannot speak for them - becau
se I was really truly protected. Anything 
that ever happened was some how smoothed ove
r. ﬁOh, she said that she™s new here. 
Anyhow, you don™t have to play with her.ﬂ 
You know, ﬁHe told you that your name  is 
like this?  You know that™s not 
true, you know you have your own na me  and that™s what it 
is.ﬂ So that, there, things
 were always smoothed over in a way where they shouldn™t 

bother me , but some  of c ourse did bother 
me  and they stayed with me  obviously. 
 
Q: Do you remember, do you reme mbe r  people 
comi ng into your parents™ house, adults, 
before, right before the war, where ther
e was people talking about what mi ght be 

happening?  Not that you partic
ipated in it, but did you ever
 experience people comi ng in 
and there being a certain kind of tension 
in the house, even though you couldn™t–?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
15 
 
 
A: Well, I know my parents were very sociab
le. They always had company and such, but I 
really don™t reme mber, no, I don™t reme mber
. As  I said, I do, did know some thing going 
on with the German Jews and I knew there wa
s fami ne in China. I knew that, but this, 
those were such big issues and I was not ever
 invited to share this
 kind of conversation, 
you know, so I guess between that and being 
protected, it really ended up by my being 
totally oblivious to the realities of the late 30s. 
 
Q: I thought ma ybe you would be si
tting outside of
 a conversation– 
 
A: Well, I would, I would listen, yes, but you 
know, some how it sort of went in and out, you 
know. 
 
Q: Okay. So then September 1939 comes, yeah, September 1939. And this must be a huge 
shock. All of a sudden– 
 
A: Yeah, the Germans, yeah, yeah. That was, 
I mean, it was not a shock, because they were 
already talking about the war, there™s gonna be a 
war, but of course the larger part of it I 
really didn™t know. I just knew that the Ge
rmans were invading and there were anti-
aircraft trenches being dug 
and all this thing - the youth, 
mobi lize the youth to dig the 
trenches. I wasn™t invi ted. 
 
Q: [Laughs.] You were too young. 
 
A: So, I wasn™t invited, but I 
do know there is going to be 
a war. Why the Germans were 
planning on a war, I didn™t know. I didn™t know 
anything except for the fact that, when, 
when, Father was, what you call, they had 
civilians for anti-aircraft, what you call– a 
civilian force for alert, you know, so my father
 was a captain for the block, or whatever 
you call it. And he used to go to briefings 
to say when, you know, and then the sirens 
would wail. So, Father went to briefing and he 
came  home and he said
 there™s going to be 
a, a bombardme nt and they are going to be
 bombarding Starachowi
ce because there is 
this factory here, this munitions factory, and th
e town is ordered to 
evacuate. You see, so 
then I knew the war was on. Now, that had to
 be very early Se ptember. The war broke 
out on the first, on the western part, so ma ybe 
this was the fourth or fifth or some thing 
like this, but fi rst week of the war. And we we
re told to evacuate, I mean, not were told - 
everybody, all the precinct captains spread th
e word, and everybody was to head for the 
forest. There were woods, you know, surroundi
ng the area. So, we did as told and 
everybody was going toward the forest. And Mother
 ma de sure that we got dressed very 
well, that we wore the be st–thi s always am
azes, amuses me because this was around the 
holidays, you know, the Jewish holidays. I got a 
pair of brand new shoes, so Mother says, 
ﬁIt™s the best thing to do is to wear the 
best clothes and to 
have enough, because God 
knows when we™ll come  back and you mi ght as
 well have the good stu
ff rather than the 
old stuff, right? ﬂ So, I put on a pair of br
and new shoes which were never broken in, and 
after, later on when we came back, I had b
listers on the feet. [Laughs.] Anyhow, we had 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
16 
 
to get dr essed in more than one thing because
, in case, when we come  back and ther e™s 
no house left, we had to have some thing. This
 was the hottest September on record. So, 
we ended up in the woods outside– 
 
Q: Buthowma ny–?  
 
A: I had a few layers of clothes and the new 
shoes, brand new shoes, which I never wore. I 
was going to wear them for the holidays.
 So that we ended up in the woods. 
 
Q: Did you take, I understand that you all carried 
some thing of value from the house. Is that 
right? 
 
A: Yes, right, not so much of value. Mother
 took sugar, yes, and I reme mbe r  she had the 
salami  kind of a thing she took there, becau
se we did not know wh
ere we were going or 
what we™ll be doing, and whatever you c ould wear, that™s the good stuff, you wore. 
 
Q: Did you take some thing special of your own?  
 
A: I forgot, that, ma ybe we did, ma
ybe, ma ybe–could be that we did. 
 
Q: No, no, no, I mean you. 
 
A: Personally?  
 
Q: A toy, a doll or some thing?  
 
A: I really don™t reme mber. I only reme mber th
e two things, that it was extremely hot and I 
had bad blisters on my feet because we ende
d up in the forest, in the words, mi xed in 
with the, not just with th
e population of Wi erzbnik, Starach
owice, but all the peasants 
who lived in the surrounding area also evacuat
ed and they basically took their horses and 
cows and dogs and so on. So you had this cacophony of sounds, the cows, and of course, 
I like to tell the story, of this, th
is sort of a joke on us type
 of incident. The factory, as you 
know, was smelting ore, because there was ore 
in the area, and they were doing, it was 
doing already war production, becau
se in Starachowice, where the factory was, the plant, 
was located in a district called 
the central [says name  in Polish] the central industrial area, 
that was organized for Poland after the first wa
r, to arm themselves because they felt, you 
know, now that Poland was independent since 
1918, they had to be arme d. We ll, they 
located these factories, the plants, in this cent
ral Poland area that had 
iron ore deposits, so 
there was ore smelting and such, so the rationale
 was such that  in the fi rst war, the fi rst 
thing that was really dest royed were all the 
munition factories and all this. By virtue of 
this historic truth, all you 
could expect is smithereens in our town, so that everybody 
evacuated because if not, you were going to be
 wi ped off the earth together with the 
factory, you see. And we found ourselves in th
e woods, with all that
 as I told you, the 
mi xture of the Hassidim and the secular Jews 
and the Christ ians and the peasants and the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
17 
 
cows and the dogs and the horses. Meanwhile, the Germans came very close by. There 
was no bombing, no significant bombing on Starachowice, because obviously they we re 

going to take over that factory in
 a blink of an eye, which th
ey did. And we got caught in 
a valley - ‚we™ meaning the entire mi xture 
of everybody - we were caught in the valley. 
The Germans were on the one - you know, I come
 from a hilly, it™s not mountainous area, 
but hilly, the Swietokrzyskie (ph)  mo untains are 
not far fr om us, but this is hilly area - so 
that you had the Germans on one side of the valley, you had the Polish troops on the 

other, and they shot at each other while we
 were in the valley, so that one horrendous 
night, when all the bullets were
 flying, we were right in th
e middle. And of course, the 
Germans in those days, and I know this fo
r a fact, many more times from this one–

Q: I think the tape stopped before you explai
ned how the planes were swooping down with 
lights underneath them a nd shooting at you. 
 
A: Yes, at the group caught in the valley 
- townspeople and the peasants from the 
surrounding areas - and of course 
that was real, true, naked warf
are, that™s what that wa s, 
because eventually, I hate to say that, but
 I do know that there was bayonet warfare going 
on, and that was my first real true
 awakening to what was happening. 
 
Q: You must have been scared to death. 
 
A: Scared to–that was a night of total f
ear. I mean, you know, later on, because I didn™t 
know fear, how, how extensive and how fierce fear
 can be, but that one night was the first 
experience in my life of acu
te fear. I didn™t know whethe
r we would ever ma ke it, 
because we were not just  in the crossfire, we 
were also being shot at from the airplane s. 
But all this went on until the morning. At da
wn, of course, everybody went back to town. 
 
Q: Let me  ask you some thing. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did your mo ther hold you?  We re you bei
ng held on to by some body during the night?   
 
A: Yes, yes, we, I reme mbe r  there were, th
e peasants had carts, y
ou know, a cart with the 
horse, and I reme mber everybody was hiding un
der carts, you know, because they could 
see, and as I said before, the Germans, they 
didn™t see us. They could hear because there 
was all that barking and baying and, and what
ever other animal sounds you could hear, 
and even if the people we re quiet. You cannot 
quiet an animal when he sees, when he 
hears shooting, so that gave us away. A
nd the funny thing is - I just reme mbered 
some thing - at daylight, at daybreak, we sort
 of scattered from the area, and then the 
planes came  again, and I ran over - ev
erybody said, ﬁRun under the bushes.ﬂ So, you 
know there were trees and bushes, because we st
ayed in the forest. The va lley was sort of 

a clearing, it was in the cleari
ng, but surrounding was the forest. 
So, I ran over as fast as I 
could and I grabbed a tree. Well, it wasn™t 
a tree! This was a Polish soldier! Because, you 
know, they had olive drab uniforms, green, type
 of green. And, of course, in the panic, I 
mean, everything, so I - the thing mo ved, the 
tree could move . We ll, I look up and there 
was the soldier, but that was more as 
a, you know, I thought I probably fe lt good about it 
because he was going to protect me , you know, 
whereas everything else was naked fear. 
And subsequently when we went home - this is
 al so very important, I think I™ve al ready 
me ntioned it - the town was not bombed, abso
lutely not bombed, and that was, with I™m 
sure by design. So that eventually when 
everybody got settled back and it was now 

official that the Germans have occupied Po
land, the factory wa s taken over and converted 
to heavy war machinery and, whereas before 
the war, Jews were not empl oyed in that 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
19 
 
plant, now Jews were beginning to be taken in 
as a labor force. Now this is just the mere 
beginning, because eventually, of cour se, the 
Jewish labor force was the primary force, 
because it was slave labor and it didn™t - they 
had to pay the Poles. So, I really, I'm not an 
authority on it, but I would suspec
t that the pr ofessional engineer
s or whoever it is in that 
war industry, were retained and perhaps thes
e unskilled workers, ma ybe the Christians, 
could have been dismissed, so that Jewish sl
ave labor was hired. Because subsequently - I 
don™t mean right now at the outbreak of the 
war - but subsequently, not only would the 
Jews start working as a force, labor force, 
in the factory, while there was still a ghetto, 

but once the ghetto was liquidated, there was 
a labor camp set up just
 to supply workers 
to the factory and, since there were always 
typhus and there were shootings and killings 
and Jews were just disposed of here and th
ere, there was foreve r a new shipme nt arriving 
of workers. Now, what the specific number
 was of workers of workers, I don™t know, 
ma ybe 2,000, but I know that the number stay
ed as was, because they had all these 
assigned spaces, I imagine. So that the slav
e labor was already in full operation shortly 
after the outbreak of the war,
 but later, when the camp was 
set up, they kept the number - 
because you know the Jews, the town was clea
red of Jews, so they had no more, no mo re 
people in Starachowice to supply for the labor fo
rce, but they did bri
ng them in from all 
over everywhere. 
 
Q: Do you happen to recall your first supper, 
dinner when you came back from the forest?   
 
A: Yes, I absolutely do! You know, it was hot summer, and we came  - in fact, when we left 
in the morning, we didn™t clear the table, b
ecause it was such a rush, and we had to get 
dressed, and we had to pack up, and Dad sa
id, ﬁWe™ve got to go, we™ve got to move 
because the bombs are going to 
fall any mi nute and the whole to
wn is just  going to be in 
ashes, and we ™ve got to get out,ﬂ So, we le
ft everything. We  came back, there were flies 
running all over, all the dishes were on th
e table, and I don™t really reme mb er but, 
whatever there was yet, I™m 
sure, you know, my mother must have kept stuff in her 
supply cupboards or whatever. So, I don™t know 
that we experienced 
starvation when we 
got back, because it took awhile - you know, 
that was basically the German, the concept 
of eliminating the Jews by any way you coul
d, so it™s by starvation, or by shooting or 
whichever. But that did not enter the pict
ure. You came home and whatever you had in 
your cupboards - and I imagine my mother mu
st have stocked up on things because the 
talk of war was so prevalent. The only thingis that, you see, this is mode rn warfare - I 

mean, not by today™s standards, when you have
 atomic weapons and such - in those days, 
that was modern warfare, but as you know 
even when you study sociology, they tell you, 
ﬁFirst things happen, then 
culture and the way of living adapts itsel f to what™s 
happening.ﬂ Now, when the second war broke ou
t, people like my parents, who survived, 
who went through the first war, applied th
e reasoning of the first war to the new 
experience of another war. In other words, wh
at was true then shoul
d be applied now, and 
this is how you are going to ma nage this new event. But of course that was as far from 

the truth as it could be, because the warf
are in the first war was not the same, the 
blitzkrieg itself, you know, the 
airplanes and all, that was the - I mean, the Germans 
occupied Poland I don™t know how
 ma ny, five days some thing like that - so who– in the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
20 
 
first, in the first war, there was no such th
ing. There was, there were battles fought hand 
to hand, and this is why the bayonet fi ght, that
 I heard later, that was sort of unusual 
because it didn™t fit the pi ctur e, but we did he
ar it at night when they said they were 
fighting with bayonets. It coul
d be that was also hearsay because, yes, people would 
expect that, judging by the first war. 
 
Q: What is your most i mme diate recollecti
on of the change for 
your life, not everybody 
else™s life, but as a child?  
 
A: Yes, the first and foremo st, I didn™t go to
 school. That was first. Number two, there is a 
river runs through Starachowice, Wi e r zbnik its
 called Kami enna, it™s a tributary of the 
Vistula. Now, we used to go swim i n the rive
r. We had a little dog and he used to go, we 
had a ma id, she loved that dog, so she - we
 would go swimming and she would soap up 
the dog in a bucket and throw him in the rive
r, and then would go after the dog in the 

river. Anyhow, so numbe r  one, there was no 
school. It was very hot, September was very 

hot - couldn™t go swimming. Then you star
ted seeing - the Germans were ma rching 
through the town, all the time, in formati
on, they sung. You know, they were always 
marching wearing those boots a
nd singing. And very soon, there 
were these - I cannot say 

whether it was Gestapo, SS or whoever - th
ey started comi ng ar
ound in these little 
groupings, individuals, two Nazis or three 
Nazis, with a dog or two dogs, so that 
imme diately put a stop to my even going outside 
to play. So, all the things that were dear 
to me , starting with school, number one, were
 now out, certainly couldn™t go Ostrowiec 
to visit Grandma because travel was out. S
o, I probably didn™t understand the larger 
picture of what was involve
d, but I certainly knew on a more
 personal basis that  things 
are completely different and that whatever 
is happening is not good. That much, I me a n, I 
could see.  
 
Q: Did you feel, as a Jewish person, as a Jewish  child, different from 
what was happening to 
the Christian Polish kids?  I mean you ha
d, there was a very close family, the 
Paliszewskis, to you, right?  
 
A: Yes, exactly, the Christian people, yes. 
Well, the point is, eventually, I mean, I don™t 
know, 10
th
 of September, 31
st
 of, 31
st
 of October or whenever, 
the schools were open and 
the children went back to sc
hool, but we didn™t. It isn™t th
at the schools were closed. The 
schools were closed to Jewish children. So, th
at was the first and imme di ate, so to say, 
blow to my –to me . And whatever other 
bigger things that 
were happening, I was 
oblivious of that because nobody 
told me . As I™ve said so 
ma ny times, my parents were 
so protective that I never re
ally knew the full truth until 
the war was over and I started 
reading up on things that I found out what 
really went on. I just
 knew that nothing was 
good anymore, and certainly I couldn™t go 
to school, so that was a big blow. 
 
Q: Was your maid Jewi
sh or Christian?   
 
A: No, no, she was Christian, she was Christian. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Q: So, what happened to the ma id and the dog?  
 
A: Well, this is, this is an interesting st
ory. I always talk about my dog, I loved him!  
 
Q: What was his name ?  
 
A: Ledy. 
 
Q: Lenny?  
 
A: Ledy , I don™t know whether he™s meant to 
be Lady or Ledy or whatever, but we called 
him Ledy. And it was a birthday present for one 
of us. My father brought him in a packet. 
He was a tiny little pup, all white, a Spitz, and 
my father - I forgot who™s birthday it was 
but that was a birthday presen
t - and he was a very love
ly, beautiful white dog but you 
had to brush him all the time , and the ma id
 adored him, her name  was Genia (ph). 
Anyhow, shortly be fore the war, he became 
vicious. What happened, 
we had, my mother, 
my grandmother, from Ostrowiec had a cousin
 by the name  of Pfeffer (ph). They were 
very well-to-do Jews in Ostrowiec, and her s
on - her sons had all the motor vehicles that 
were good in 1939 - her son, one son had a Ford
 and one son had a motorcycle, and he 
came running through Starachowice on his motorcycle and had an accide nt  and ended up 
in the hospi tal, in the Star achowice hospita
l. He was fro m Os tr
owiec his name  was 
Pfeffer (ph), the last name , but I don™t know
 his first name . Well, anyhow, the mother 
imme diately came, stayed with us, and she 
cooked for him. She st
arted cooking all these 
exquisite dishes, and he wouldn™t eat, because
 he was laid up in the hospital - I don™t 
know he had broken bones - she would bring it 
back and feed it to 
the dog. Now, the dog 
was on a very strict, whatever. This dog st
arted eating all these fancy things. Anyhow, 
this is the story I was told why he becam
e vicious. One day, a woman was passing by - 
because there was a big courtyard, you know, 
in European houses, you had a gate, like a 

big gate you went through, and there was 
a courtyard - a woman was comi ng through the 
courtyard, he was barking to get out, he ju
mped on the handle, however, he got himself 

out of the house, ran over and tore the woma n™
s skirt up front, a whole big chunk of skirt. 
Well, after that, of course, my parents had to
 pay for the clothes and so on, but he was 
taken to a farm, so we had to give him aw
ay, because he was unma nageable. I always 
knew that he was spoiled by that food, but
 ma ybe not, I don™t know. But anyhow, so we 
didn™t have the dog. As for the ma id, she lived 
way out, at the outskirts of the town, with 
an old mother. And she was a ma id for my parents from way back, I mean, way, way, 

like when Hania was a ba by, because we have pictures from the Baltic sea and such, she 

sits there, Genia (ph) sits with Hania, you 
know, we see her in pictures, we saw her in 
pictures a lot. Anyhow, she lived in the outskir
ts of the city, and s
ubsequently she turned 
out to be one of those who did not prove he
rself to be a true friend, because she took 
things from us during the war that Mother 
wanted to give her to save, like a sewing 
machine, you know, things of value, and she 
absolutely denied. Wh
en Chris and Hania 
went back to Poland and went to see her, sh
e had drapes, velvet, gr
een velvet drapes, and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
22 
 
bedspreads to ma tch, it was hanging and she sa
id she didn™t have it. My mother had a box 
of china that was in perfect condition that she took. She denied it; it 
was right there. And 
she, I think she said she was going to
 denounce them, Chris and Hania, you know, 
because you know Chris and Hania went back 
to Starachowice and there was this horrible 
incident that night, and the Paliszewskis save
d their life. So, you ri
ght away have this 
balance, you can balance this, whether Ge
nia (ph) was greed, it was pure greed, or 
whether it was other motivation, I don™t know, but she was member of the  fa mily for 
years, I mean, ma ny years, so that she did not
 prove to be a friend, as good a friend as she 
ought to have been, because she was treatedvery well by the fa mily. But of course the 

others, the Pa liszewskis, they 
were people who saved our li
ves and such. So, you can see 
there is never a one answer to this kind of 
a problem. This is why I™ve always felt that, as 
much as you want to reme mber personal incide
nts, the true picture to me  of living in 

Poland as a Jewish person is not of one of 
animosity to the others, you just, you have to 

have that understanding because always fo
r one example, you will always find anothe r 
example to counterbalance that, and this is
 exactly how I have felt right along and not 
ma ny peopl e feel that way, I know. 
 
Q: No, I was going to ask you why, because ofte
n, certainly in my fa mily, the anger at the 
Polish population is sometimes more 
severe than to the Germans.  
 
A: Yes, this is how it was, and people fr om
 my home town, ver y much so. I don™t know if 
you know that I was involved with the restor
ation of the cemetery 
in Starachowice, and 
when I originally brought up the subject - late
r I went to Poland in 1980 and we went to 
the cemetery with the Pa liszewsk
i™s granddaughter, she took us
 there - we took pictures 
of the cemetery itself and of different tomb
stones which were, of course, overturned and 
overgrown and whatever. I rea
lly don™t read Yiddish, so I couldn™t tell whose tombstones 
they were. Nobody from our fa mily is buried there. Anyhow, when I came back and 

Victor ma de large size, you know he blew 
up the photo - we had them ma de into large 
photographs and I took them to the Star
achowice reunion, at the annual _________. Well, 
I was practically atta
cked by some . They told me , ﬁRenia, you should be ashame d of 
yourself. How you even think of having to, th
at we should restore some thing to give 

money to them. They ne ver did anything fo
r us. They would take the mo ney, they 
wouldn™t do it, anyhow.ﬂ This is 
a project that started in 1980 
and it was only realized ten 
years ago, because I finally realized ther
e were people of good will who decided those 
who feel that way do not have to participat
e, and we did, and we did through the right 
channels and with the right money a nd ever
ything is done. In fact, I just wrote an 
introduction to the book that™s comi ng out about
 the cemetery, and I was very fortunate to 
have it registered with one of the people fr
om my home town who were dear friends of 
my fa mily, Pola Frank (ph). She is no longer 
alive; she was my teacher in Poland. In then 
last mi nute, we registered the Jewish cemeter
y in New York with a Jewish organization - 
I don™t know the name  of it. The building 
is right across Temple Emanuelle on 5
th
 
Avenue, 65th Street. I think there was a Ra
bbi Chaiar (ph), or 
Chaiat (ph) some body. 
And we ca me in, and said we don™t have the f
unds yet, but we™d very much like to have 
this on - they were submitting a list to the 
Polish governme nt of Jewish cemeteries - in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
23 
 
the nick of time, he said next week or next
 day, whatever, they were going to submit. We  
got the name  in. So, imme diately, within a y
ear, there was a sign pos
ted that this is a 
historic landma rk not to be touched. But 
it took us a number, a good number of years to 
realize that we should not wait 
around or take the criticism 
of our home town people for, 
to prevent us from doing the project. And betw
een Israel and Canada and us, we had the 
money in no time. We se nd - it was done th
rough Israel: the mone
y was sent in, the 
architect was found, the caretakers were
 found. Apparently, that cemetery in 
Starachowice is now the mode
l restored cemetery. But you see, this, I said that in 
reference to how other people felt. Not only di
d they feel terrifi c animosity to the Poles 
during all that went on, because, you know, a lo
t of people felt that the Poles did not do 
for Jews what they could have. But, you see, ev
en after the wa r, for some thing as terribly 
important as a Jewish ceme tery in a town th
at had all this populat
ion obliterated, there 
isn™t a sign that there was Je
wish community there except for the cemetery, and that was 
my project fr om the beginning, Pola Frank (
ph) and I were saying: Here you have the 
pictures, here is what it looks like, the houses
 were being built on the cemetery, first the 
Germans took the tombstones to pave roads, 
then the Poles brought their homes closer 
and closer. Give it a few more years and you w
ould have nothing, so that we were very 
lucky that, against all the criticism, we went
 ahead and because we worked in cooperation 
with Israel and Canada, we were really able 
to do it. And now I™m 
so pleased about that. 
This is really some thing, you know, second 
generation people go to visit, and other 
people from Israel, and I was told that 
even the people who do oversee now, you know, 
whoever oversees the Jewish cemeteries in Pola
nd, says that ours is 
the ni cest, the best 
kept and so forth. The stones are upright, the 
lettering was done, it™s
 cleaned up, beautiful 
fence, iron fence with a beautiful gate with
 the ma gendavit (ph) on it, very nice, very 
nice. 
 
Q: All right, let™s get back now. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The one question I wanted to ask before the 
tape is going to run out is what did, happened 
in your fami ly when school was no longe
r possible for you. I understand a little school 

was developed in your house?  
 
A: A little school developed, right! And Hani
a, of course, was the main force behind it 
because she was the fami ly genius - she had 
all the books. In fact, when she was in high 
school in Radom, she used to do tutoring, anyhow, so this was like breathing air for her. 

And she took three of my friends and myself
 and she forme d a little class, and we 
followed the curriculum which she knew and for which the books were available in the 

house. So, it was a regular school, with regularhome work, and I resented the fact that she 

expected more of me than all the others, and 
I said, I mean, s he lives 
with me in the house 
- you™d think she could be a litt
le easier on me , but no. But, of
 course, later on I realized 
that my really truly foundation for my fu
rther education came from that, because we 

really studied seven days a week. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
24 
 
 
Q: Seven?  
 
A: Well, we did it at home. You couldn™t go 
swimming, the dogs were - the Germans we re 
out with the dogs, people were be
ing rounded up for slave labor, 
and kids were just either 
shot or kicked or the dogs was, you know, they
 were always threatened with dogs and the 
Nazis went around with the rubber whips, so 
even if you didn™t get killed, you could be 
beaten up terribly, a dog could 
eat you up or whatever, so th
e only thing was to be home  
and that, that really was– 
 
Q: So, how ma ny hours a da y was Hania teaching?  
 
A: I don™t reme mber, but big section, a big segm
ent of the day was for classroom, and then 
there was home work. And then I - he re
mi nds me, of a friend of mi ne, Mitye 
Weigensburg (ph), they were neighbors not fa
r from us, and people wanted to read books. 
There was no access to libraries, we are 
now talking about the secular Jews, you know. 
So he and I opened a lending library. He al
ways remi nds me a bout it - he lives in 

Connecticut we meet once a year at 
the _______. We took books from every house, 
whoever wanted to, and we had a lending lib
rary, so today you had my books and I had 
yours, and we kept records. 
 
Q: So you™re ten, eleven years old?  
 
A: Yes, yes, and you know, the stra
nge thing about it is, I always
 say, I talk about it, nothing 
ever goes to waste, because, in later years wh
en my kids were in public school in New 

York, I was the volunteer chairman of the lib
rary in the school for 11 years, I ran the 
volunteers who worked in the school library he
re, so, I always tell him, I say, ﬁGuess 
what?  Whatever we did then applies now.ﬂ A
nd that was true, so the schooling was done 
at home the homework was done at home a
nd the rest was still around the books, we had 

the lending library. People were delighted 
to get books because people couldn™t go out, 
you know, and this is already in the ghetto, 
you know, because later on 
forget it, later on 
was different.  
 
Q: You had paper, enough paper in the house?  
 
A: Yes, because in the ol d days, you know 
how to recycle everyt hing. I me an, you never 
threw away a little piec e of paper that  wasn
™t filled in. And we ma de little cards, so we 
wrote who - I can assure you it wasn™t the Dewe
y decima l system - it was just a scribble 
here, a scribble there, Mrs. X got this book and Mrs. Z got the other book. 
 
Q: Okay, I think we™ll take a break now. 
 
End of Tape #3 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Tape #4
 
 
Q: Renia, tell me  some thi ng about what you th
ink the effect of having a home  schooling was 
on you?  I wondered whether you thought that in fu
ture years that it was very helpful to 
have all this - whatever it was you learned - in your head. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
[Tape interruption] 
 
A: First of all, you know, as a child, you don™t 
really plan a future 
and you don™t look ahead 
to things that are included in the grown 
up world. You live in your own little world, and 
one day™s this and the next day™
s that, and past it, ma ybe two 
more days, and past it, there 
is no planning. But absolute - my absolute thr
ill about being able to study was that I was 
back in school. Not for future background or
 future foundations of how I was going to 
use it or  not use it. It was just the mere f
act that my access to study was not severed as 
was my access to everythi ng else , such as going swi mmi ng in the river or  playing 
outdoors or whichever. So, this was absolutely
 the only viewpoint that I had. Never for a 
mi nute orienting myself to how that was 
going to come  in handy. Aside from which, you 
know, as I analyze now the system, the edu
cational system in Poland as against the 
system in America, Polish education emphasized
 - it was sort of an elitist concept - but it 
emphasized education for its own sake. Y
ou know?  You could end up being a carpenter, 
but you could at the same time be the hi
ghly educated person
 who read all the 
philosophers and knew the highest level of ma
the matics, and never apply it to what you 
were doing, but had the education. And, I don™t 
know, by osmosis, I guess, that rubbed 
off - that concept rubbed off on me. So that 
studying, as I said before, because this was 
war, and I was back in school, and just one 
day to the next being occupied by books was 
great. But by the same  token, I always br
eathed that air that said, you know, you study 
because it™s such fun; because
 you™re going to be a ma the matician or you™re going to be  a 

professor or whatever. You studied because that
 was really pa rt of 
the great, great joy of 
life. And so, assumi ng that I, in my c hild™s
 way, incorporated thos
e two aspects, it was 
study for its own sake. Plus, it kept me out of 
the street where the Germans were with the 
dogs. And it kept me  very occupied. Plus, it also kept me  in a competitive setting. It 

wasn™t monotonous to the extent that 
you were doing everything for yourself, by 
yourself, without measuring yourself against some other people. And these were my very 

dear friends, so that the 
entire idea really revolved around 
being occupied - gainfully 
occupied, not just killing time or wasting 
time. And whoever even thought - I certainly 
didn™t know - planning for the future. I could 
never, ever visualize, even when I was 
older during the war and the war was comi ng to
 an end, I couldn™t even visualize the end 
of the war or what I would be doing. There wa
sn™t such thing in my mi nd ever of a pre-
set plan, you know, of applying this to that a
nd doing this and that. Everything that came  
after really evolved out of my
 basic studies with Hania, th
ere™s no question about it. It™s 
just that I brought to it a cer
tain attitude already, which of
 course lasted me  for the 
lifetime, that school is jo
y and I loved it and it wa s good. 
But I didn™t know how it was

going to fit in the future - who knew that I 
would even survive, and who even knew how 
the world would end, how it would look, and how
... No, this is totally outside the realm 
of my i magi nation. Really, to put it totally in
 the perspective, that
™s exactly how it goes. 
It didn™t– The idea of a future occupation or 
a future plan that would evolve out of the 
study with Hania never entered my mi nd, really! 
 
Q: How ma ny hours a day 
did Hania teach you?  
 
A: You know, that I couldn™t tell you, but I know 
it wa s a, it was a big chunk of the day, big. 
Plus the fact that I did home work, and lots of 
it. Lots and lots of it, so that I was really 
occupied all day. 
 
Q: Did she give you good grades?  
 
A: She did, but she always reprimanded me  ‚cau
se she said I could do better than that. So, 
she did reprimand me, even in front of the othe
r kids. I didn™t apprec
iate that, but I loved 
her anyhow. But of course my parents were 
absolutely thrilled because there was nothi ng 
for a child to do, and being outdoors was very da
ngerous, so that, that really filled all the 
needs. My parents were satisfied, I was 
happy, Hania was happy, so all around, it really 
was good. 
 
Q: So, did you not go outside at all?  
 
A: Practically not. Because, even if you did go to
 play, like ki ds play ball or some thing, and 
some body would say, ﬁOh, they™re out again wi
th the dogs,ﬂ you would imme diately go 
in. Because, you know, people were be ing - grown- ups were being rounded up for all 
kinds of things: for deportati
ons, for killings, for cleaning, for whatever. But children 
were just as big a temptation for a Nazi with
 a dog as a grown-up was, just for the sake 

of, you know, scaring a Jew kid. 
 
Q: Just to get everything clear, you were 10 years old when– 
 
A: –when the war broke out, right. 
 
Q: Hania was 15 when she was starting 
to teach you, right? And Chris is 13. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Right?  
 
A: And Chris was also in a class, in Hania™s class. 
 
Q: Really? 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
27 
 
A: Yeah, but not in my class. Hers wasn™t a 
real class; hers was mo
re– You see, this was 
the whole idea of keeping yourse
lf occupied with books. At my
 level, it was a class. I 
don™t know that Chris had home work or 
anything. But it was more like ma ybe 
discussions or reading toge
ther, you know, like people could 
get together to read and 
share books. But that was a very wonderful - th
is wasn™t an idea that came from outside; 
it came from the house. But that real
ly kept us out of harm™s  way. 
 
Q: It put you in 
a different world. 
 
A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, to sit out the war - nobody knew anythi
ng about anything that 
was going to happen or wouldn™t happen, but 
you know, you have to 
sit out the war and 
however best you can, and this was a fine way. 
 
Q: So, the thoughts that you had 
are that this is war, nothing 
else terribly bad, it would be 
deprivation– 
 
A: Yeah, it™s not the fi rst war that  the parents 
were talking about, and people who were still 
around that have lived through the first war.
 You know, the deprivation, and then the 
soldiers are fighting, you see.
 And if you™re not on the front
, and you™re not caught where 
the soldiers are fi ghting, then the war will 
bl ow over and ever ything will be fi ne again. 
Because it™s the soldiers w
ho fight; civilians don™t fight. 
 
Q: So, how do you reme mb er what happened 
to your father?  Do you reme mber what you 
saw when you were 10, 11, 12, during those–?  
 
A: Well, I™ll tell you what I reme mber. As I told
 you, the me mo ry being so selective, that I 
reme mber all these nonsense things - not nonsense, 
but the little things 
that really stuck in 
my mi nd, when the biggest 
things escape my me mory. 
But I do reme mbe r  how my 
mother was upset when Father was rounde
d up for cleaning detail. You know, because 
this was below his station. I think I sa id that 
in the interview, because
 that also stuc k in 
my mi nd. Mother always talked about it. Father wa s rounded up in the street and nobody 

knew where he was. And Mother went, and sh
e said, oh, you know - she was told that the 

people who were rounded up are cleaning out 
- cleaning - are sweep
ing the railroad 
station. So, she went to the railroad stati
on. She was looking, couldn™t find him, and there 
was this German - Ger man soldier, but she didn™t see the me n, the Jews there. So, she 

went over to him and asked him, ﬁExcuse me, where are the 
herren
?ﬂ - Where are the 
gentleme n?  And he said, ﬁThese aren™t gen
tleme n; these are Jews!ﬂ And how Mother was 
upset about that, and of course, Father  was te
rribly humiliated. Because this was early on 
- this was still in ™39 - and this was such
 a humiliating experience for a man, like this, and 
for Mother, too. So, Mother always talked abou
t it. Of course, we r
ealized later on that 
this didn™t really mean all that much, b
ecause what came later is a totally di fferent 
category. But in those days - this was right 
after the Germans conquered Poland - so, that 
much I reme mber that Mother was very upset
 about it. You know, those are small things, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
28 
 
big things, but they are a very big part of 
the bigger picture of genocide, because those 
were the initial steps, as you would now 
know, but certainly we 
didn™t know then.  
 
Q: Do you have any recollection of the time 
your father came home having somewhat been 
beaten up by a Nazi? 
 
A: Very vague, very vague. That, I know it ha
ppened, but the recollec
tion is very vague. 
Maybe I just eliminated it from my psyc
he some how. No, that I don™t really– I just 
reme mber one man, Roman Zinger, was br
ought around. He was hit and his jaw was 
dislocated. And he was taken around by theGermans to show what you™re going to look 
like if you do not obey. I reme mber that, but
 I don™t reme mbe r  about my father. 
 
Q: How long were you able to stay in the ap
artment you had been living in when you came 
back after the evacuation?  
 
A: Well, probably ‚til early 1940, because we liv
ed on the ma in street, which connected the 
old Wi erzbnik and Starachowice. That was ca
lled the main street , and that was called 
Piusutskego (ph). First it wa
s called Starachowice, then it
 was called Piusutskego (ph). 
That was the first street evacuated, because that wa s the so-called best  street. After - and 

we were just pushed further into Wi e r zbnik. 
You see, we were on the connecting street 
between the two towns. We were pushed furt
her into Wi erzbnik, but that was only the 
first location. We  had three more places that we lived in before the towns were 

liquidated. I don™t know how much of the Star
achowice story was told in terms of the 
historical events. You see, 
there was no so-called closed 
ghetto, as we know a ghetto to 
be, like a large ghetto, like the Wa rsaw ghett
o. Our ghetto was a gradual - As other parts 
were being cleared of the Jews in my home
town, they were being sent further into 
Wi erzbnik. As little villages were be ing ev
acuated around the town, all these people were 

being sent further into Wi erzbnik. But the Chri
stians who lived there were not dislocated, 
you see, so that at no point was there such a 
thing as a barbed wire
 or anything like that, 
you see?  Those Christians who s
till lived there lived there, a
nd the Jews were just packed 
in and packed in and packed in. And then of c
ourse our street that we
 were sent to, that 
was cleared, so we had to go further in, a
nd we ended up next to the Christian cemetery 
called the Old Ceme tery - there are two, th
e New Ce me tery and the Old Ce me tery. We, 
our last residence was past the Old Ce me tery 
- that was the location - and we lived in a 
Christian™s home. He was a teamster; he ha
d a horse and wagon. They occupied half, and 

we had a kitchen and a din- and a living- one
 room and a kitchen. Half of his house. And 
until the time until we were actually liqu- th
at the town was liquidated, that™s where we 
lived. That™s where went for the Final Soluti
on, my parents and I, not Hania and Chris.  
And they lived next door; the Christians liv
ed next door. So this is, this happened 
between 1940, early 1940, when Piusutskego (p
h) Street was cleared, up to October 27, 
1942. That was life in the ghetto. 
 
Q: Until™42. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
29 
 
A: ™42,yes. 
 
Q: When you moved each of these three times, 
is it your parent s who found t he place? Or 
you just run out?  Do you have any idea?  
 
A: No. I have no idea. 
 
Q: You have no idea?  
 
A: I imagine there was a relocation office orsome thing. I really don™
t know. I couldn™t tell 
you. 
 
Q: What do you recall about what your father 
was doing?  Obviously, he™s no longer for a 
long time doing–?  
 
A: He was a scribe. 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: He was a secretary. He used to type. I rea
lly don™t know, but I know 
that he was not what 
you call a functionary of any significance. You 
know, he had, he had, he™s not part of any 
Judenrat. 
 
Q: So, there was a Judenrat?  
 
A: I think so. I™m not sure. But I know Father
 was always, because he was so neat and 
organized, and he typed, and so he was al
ways that guy who did the secretarial work 
through the camp, you know, through the ghetto 
and the camp. But I truly don™t know. I 
think there was a Judenr at in town– 
 
Q: But you™re not sure. 
 
A: Not sure, and I really wo
uldn™t know who was in it. Even
 though I did read in the 
Starachowice
, the book, the name s, but I real
ly wouldn™t know for sure.  
 
Q: During this period, prior to the ghetto really
 being for med, even though it isn™t a closed 
ghetto, do you experience a lot of
 fear, knowing that you have to be in the house, even in 
spite of the fact that 
you love schooling so much. 
 
A: Oh, yes, but then I first st
arted to realize what this was 
all about. I me an, we didn™t know 
what this was leading up to, 
and we certainly didn™t - 
I
 
certainly didn™t know what was 
happening elsewhere, that I didn™t know. But I 
did know that, by virtue of being near the 
plant, the war production plant, 
that people were being sent in
 for their labor. You see, I 
didn™t realize that basically it
 was the other way around. People
 were being cleared out of 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
30 
 
other pl aces to be sent  here, not because they
 were needed. In other words, the Germans 
didn™t go outside of the ghetto to find these 
people. It™s just that all these other 
communities were being cleared, and Starachow
ice was the logical pl ace to shove them 
into, even though it would be bursting at th
e seams, for the reason this was access to 
slave labor. Of course, I know this
 all in hindsight, but in those days, it just seemed that 
perhaps they were trying to have more labor, a 
bigger labor force, so they were just going 
out and sending these people in. But of
 course, it was the other way around. 
 
Q: Is your, is your mother working also?  
 
A: I think so. Ye s, I think so. But I don™t re
me mber where, but I think she was working. 
 
Q: So, you™re in the house with your– 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Both sisters?  Chris was–  
 
A: Chris and Hania were wo
rking in the brick factory. 
 
Q: Right from t he beginning?  
 
A: I don™t remember. I just reme mber 
at the end, that™s where they were. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I was given a job very shortl
y, very - probably, at the, the 
same  month probably that they 
cleared the town of Jews , I was given a job in
 the factory, in the pl
ant, just putting the– 
You know, these were cannon shells; they weren™
t too big. You were supposed to put it 
on, on the machine, and the lathe would, you 
know, like you carve an apple, would take 
off the first peel and then you took it off.
 It was piecework. And they were around to 
watch you and count. You put it down; you put
 another one. Anybody could do it; you 
didn™t need the Herculean strength to do that
. And then, of course, after the town was 
cleared of Jews, and of course, that™s going fu
rther into the camps, I started working in 

the laundry. So, after that, I 
never worked in the factory, 
only in the laundry. Whereas 
Hania and Chris were detained overnight in the 
br ick factor y, so that the morning that  the 

town was cleared of Jews, they did not report 
to the square, the ma rket square. But I did, 
with my parents. 
 
Q: I want to get to that, but 
I just want to ask you a question 
about your little school friends, 
that you went to school with. 
 
A: Yes. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
31 
 
Q: Were these close friends of yours?  
 
A: Yes, I™m Jewish, obviously, yes, and from th
e same , from the same  type of fa mily. You 
see?  Again, as I was trying to explain, I did not 
mean to divide it into superior or inferior 
or anything. The secular type of Jews who 
lived in town, and these were my friends. 
They were absolutely my friends. 
 
Q: And did they live very n
earby?  Because given what you said, it was dangerous for kids– 
 
A: Yes, well, they lived very nearby, yes, they 
did. They lived on Piusutskego (ph) also, so it 
was very, I mean, access was easy. 
 
Q: Did you talk privately with 
them about what was going on?  
 
A: Frankly, I probably did, because I was al
ways very curious about everyt hi ng, you know, 
but maybe I just– I absolutely
 don™t reme mber. But, I™ll te
ll you frankly, when there was 
talk about war, before the war broke out, a
nd my parents said, ﬁOh, it™s going to be a 
horribl e thing if there is a war because the fi
rst war was so bad.ﬂ You know, they used to 
tell us about the first war. And quietly I wa
s thinking to myself, ﬁWhy would a war be so 
bad?  You know?  You could lear
n all these new things and you could find out and it™s 
different–ﬂ So, quietly thought, well, I thi
nk the war would be good, because from my 
viewpoint, why not?  I mean, all 
these exciting things that my
 parents were talking about, 
you see?  So, then, when the war came, and I am
 quite sure that we talked - the kids, 
among ours e lves - talked about the same  thi
ng, up to a point . Because fina lly, when we 
realized what was really going on, then I am 
sure that we changed around. Because once 
we started fearing for our own lives, it was no 
mo re that idealized version of new things 
happening. And that I reme mber distinctly, that 
I always used to say, 
ﬁGee, I really would 
like a war, because I would know what - 
you know, new things that are happening, you 
know, how they do it. Because war means soldie
rs fighting; it doesn™t apply otherwise.ﬂ 
 
Q: So, it was a sort of entertainment that
 your parents gave you with these stories– 
 
A: Not an entertainment. It was some thing, it 
was an experience that 
I would really, yes, I 
would very be glad to be part of
, but– uh– it didn™t turn out that way. 
 
Q: Chris told a story of about a bunch of youngpeople - I have no idea if you were there - 
outside when some body - now, I don™t know exac
tly where this is because I don™t know 
exactly where she was de scribi ng - they were 
outside, it seemed to be the summer, a nd 
some  young ma n ca me  out from the bushes l
ooking awful and talking about Treblinka. 
And Chris and Hania brought him in
to the house. We re you there?  
 
A: I™m sure I was there, but I don™t remember that. 
 
Q: You don™t reme mber the story?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
32 
 
 
A: You see, how big was the house?  By now, we
 must have lived in one room. I couldn™t 
absent myself. The fact is my parents neve
r told me  directly a
nything. Whatever I did 
know, I probably guessed, and then I probably ra
tionalized quickly, that
 this was, because 
you know, they were saying rumors, all kinds of gossip. And rumors, gossip, I™m sure 
they were saying rumors and gossip just to
 protect us. You know, but I truly don™t know. 
I™ve said it so ma ny time s. I don™t know what
 they knew, and what they didn™t know, and 
how much they withheld from me personally, 
not from Hania and Krysia. You see that I 
really don™t know. Chris was really sort of 
a mor e  ma ture person. Chris was always a 
hands-on and practical type, so I think she c
ould have known much more than I did, but I 
did not know. 
 
Q: Actually, she said that she didn™t believe 
this guy. And brought him in to the house, and 
your parents asked her to leave. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So, she didn™t hear– 
 
A: You see, so she also didn™t hear. And if
 she didn™t hear and was asked to go out, I 
certainly would never had been told 
about it. That™s absolutely a fact. 
 
Q: Now, during these two years prior to the - be
cause I want to get to the evacuation - during 
these two years, are thin
gs getting worse in terms of food, in terms of–?  
 
A: Yes, this was the time  when the screw 
was being tightened, you see. There was scarce 
food; you had to really fight for it. You had 
to keep - you could still barter; you still had 
access to the Polish population, you see, so 
you could barter and you could buy and you 
could try the hardest you could, but subsiste
nce was meager, very meager. And then - I 
don™t know if Chris told you about it - but one
 Sunday, when people are leaving church - 
you know, the church wa s up on Church Street. 
Cruzcherna (ph) was up on the hill, and 
the ma rket square, where we were eventuall
y, from which we were sent to the selection. 
The market square was - comi ng down from 
Cruzcherna (ph), from
 the church, was the 
ma rket square. Some thing happened - Poles killed a German or some thing - and I 

reme mber distinctly, they built a gallows in
 the ma rket square and they hung 12 Poles on 
a Sunday, when people were comi ng down from th
e church, from Cruzch
erna (ph) Street, 
from Churc h Street, down to the square. In ot
her words, I suspect that whatever exchange 
there was between the Jews and the Poles, su
rreptitious as it was 
and quiet as it was, 
could have di mi nished to a great extent, b
ecause that was a warning to othe rs, too. Of 
course, I found out what happe
ned years later that they lu
red a German or two Ger mans 
to a prostitute and they got ther e and they
 killed them. And so for that, 12 Poles were 
hung on a Sunday after church. So, I imagine - 
I don™t know what year this was, but we 
were still living in th
e so-called ghetto. And, of c ourse, wh
ether this is a 
direct result - 
whether the starvation that was setting in was a 
direct result of this warning that they gi ve 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
33 
 
to the Christians, they gave to the Christ
ians, I don™t know. But,
 of course, food was 
scarce and, and things we re very bad. The onl
y thing was that Mother
 was very inventive; 
she once an excellent cook, so she made things 
out of nothing. The first time  in my life I 
ate cookies that was baked with sugar beets, 
ma de with sugar beets - it™s because there 
was no sugar, of course. So, th
at™s, that™s the screw was bei
ng tightened, but it wasn™t yet 
completely tight. You see, ther
e was still the possibility of
 surviving, if the sickness 
didn™t kill you, if they didn™t shoot you, 
if the dogs didn™t tear you to shreds. 
 
 
Q: One very brief question before we take a 
break, because the tape is going to run out: Do 
you reme mb er when you had to put an armband?  I understand you wore an armband? 
 
A: Yes, absolutely, a white armband with a blue
 - a blue Star of Da
vid on it. Probably right 
away, probably when we still lived on Pius
utskego (ph), I suspect
, including children. 
 
Q: Until the end? Until the evacuation? 
 
A: Oh, yes, absolutely. 
 
Q: Right. All right, let™s take 
a break and change the tape. 
 
End of Tape #4

Q: Renia, I want to ask you to describe on
e of the mo st difficult days, probably, of your 
entire life, the evacuation, October 27
th
, 1942. 
 
A: Yes,yes. 
 
Q: Can you lead us through the day?  
 
A: Yes. First, I have to say 
that Chris and Hania - Ana - were
 employed in the brick factory. 
Because, as you well know by now, there was 
the munitions factory, munitions pl ant, 
there was the brick fact or y and ther e was the sawmill, and I think ther e was one more. I 
don™t reme mber. All these employed slave labor. 
And the word got around - first of all, 
able-bodied people were take
n anyhow - but word got around that if you work, you have 
a chance to have a better life. Not survived - we
 didn™t talk about surviv
al and all that. It™s 
just that you could live a little bett
er if you had a job. So, anybody who was anybody 
secured a job. Now, Hania and Chris worked in
 the brick factory, and they had the night 
shift. October 26
th
 to 27
th
 is when they were inside the factory, in the brick factory. 
October 27
th
 in the morning - I think 6:00 in the 
morning - is when the round up started 
for the evacuation of the Jews from the hom
etown. Now, Hania and Krysia were never 
released from the factory, and I really 
don™t know about people who worked in the 
munitions plant, but I imagine they were al
so kept back, because they were already a 
work force that could be counted on. We ll, I wa
s at home at the last 
of our residences in 
the ghetto, sharing the house with this Chri
stian fa mily, and that was past the Old 
Ce me tery, the old - old Christian ceme tery. We  
were ma de to walk. First of all, the knock 
came on the door, and ﬁEverybody out, everybody
 out.ﬂ We got dressed - I know, again, 
several layers of clothing - and we were dr
iven toward the market
 square. So, as we 
passed the old cemetery, we started comi ng near
er to the ma rket square, and that™s where 

a lot of Jewish people lived 
before the war anyhow, but now, of course, it was packed, 
because ot he r streets have been cleaned - not
 cleaned, but cleared of the Je wish people. 
And as people would walk out of the buildings, if
 they didn™t walk straight, if their child 
was crying, the Germans were in a total fr
enzy, and there were Latvians who were 

assisting. They were shooting at anybody who 
didn™t rush, who didn™t go as fast as he 
was told, who didn™t walk straight, had one 
more bundle than, than it was absolutely 
allowed. So that, between the old cemetery a
nd the square, which was probably no mo re 
than half a mile, there was such atrocities
 that I rather thought the world was ending. 
Because, I mean, I™d seen a lot of things up 
to that point , you know, but I had never seen 
people falling and children, infants smashe
d against the walls, and you know, horror upon 
horror, and this was only a half a mile wa
lk. Now, my parents held me  by my hand on 
each side , and as I said, I was overdressed be
cause Mother insisted. I al so was a very 
skinny child, and she wanted to ma ke me
 look more ma ture. Of course, I wasn™t 
developed, I was just a me re child, so she s
hoved some stuff into me to make me look 
ma ture and developed and she put rouge on my cheeks. And we walked to the ma rket 

square, and as we were comi ng closer, ther
e was a building where 
Mother™s very dear 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
35 
 
friends lived, and there was a fa mily Kalinye
rska (ph). Mrs. Kali
nyerska (ph) was an 
elderly woman, ma ybe in her seventies - I mean, for a child, age at that time– I don™ t 
know, but I know old Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph), th
at™s how I know her. Her daughter went to 
Palestine through the effort
s my mot her™s Zionist 
ha-sharat
 (ph). So, she was there. And 
as we were passing very near the square, Mo
ther - she couldn™t wa
lk - Mother took her 
under the arm and walked with 
her to the square, and I fo
llowed with my father. And 
when we came to the square, the scene was i
ndescribable, because they had the Latvians 
and they had the Germans and they had dogs. And people were being whipped with 

rubber whips, and people were shot with ri
fles and with guns and with whatever. And 
people were screaming and everybody - they 
were shouting and - whatever. We  ca me  on 
a scene which was very hard to understand, because the Germans, who were standing at 

each corner of the square, directed the peopl
e comi ng out of these ad
jacent streets: ﬁTo 
the right here, you go this way, you go this 
way.ﬂ You had no idea which way you were 
going. All I knew in the final analysis was 
that Fa ther was sent one way, which I 
understood because the me n were separated, 
I was sent another way, and Mother and 

Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were sent another wa
y. So, I still couldn™t ma ke out what is 

happening here, and who is going where a
nd why. Very soon, my group was whipped 
into formation, and I me an whipped in to form
ation, I think five rows and five across, and 
we were driven toward Starachowice, mean
ing by Piusutskego (ph) and that way. And 
we had to march in formation, as if to - as 
if to a beat, and whoever couldn™t ma ke it, 
whoever stumbled, was immediatel
y shot on the spot. Now, I at
 this point had no - First 
of all, I didn™t know where Hania and Krys
ia were. I knew they never came home from 

the factory. So, I could just imagine that they
 could have been sent
 in another group like 
this - whatever - or ma ybe they were some where dead and I didn™t see them. I didn™t 
know. And as I got into the group driven th
at way toward Starachowice plant, I found 
myself eventually in Strzelni
ca - of course, I didn™t know wh
at Strzelnica was about - but 
this is where I ended up, in Strzelnica in an
 open area, and we were
 told to sit down and 
stay there. I was beside myself
 with fear. I was horror-stricken
 and totally lo
st. I think of 
all my traumatic experi ences in the world, that
 is absolutely the most trau matic. Because 
you know, at all other time s, I had some body tolean on - Chris and Hania or my parents - 
this, I was totally alone, and 
I really didn™t know, you see. 
I didn™t know that Chris and 
Hania were still around. I was petrified. I 
cried, and I was– So, people who knew the 
fa mily, they said, ﬁOh, don™t cry. Mother will co
me , and this will sort  itself out. This is 
whatever it is. They–ﬂ Whatever. Eventuall
y, I found out that Father was in the same 

camp, in other words, he was with th
e me n and I was put with the wome n.
 
 
Q: So, you ma rched off with wome n. 
 
A: With wome n, to Strzelnica, and Father
 ma rched off to Strzelnica with the me n. 
Subsequently we found out that 
people like my mother and 
Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were 
put on a train. Nobody was saying where, but of
 course, that train 
went to Treblinka. 
Hania and Krysia, on the other ha
nd, after all this was 
over, they were sent to place called 
Majowka, which was another camp i n town. So that some how, because then they st arted - 

people were beginning to be shifted, because
 I forgot how it was - I think Majowka 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
36 
 
people used to work in the sawmill, or some
thing, or the brick f
actory - I really don™t 
know how it was all decided who worked wher
e - but I do know that word came back to 
us that Hania and Krysia survived - no, the wo
rd was not ‚survived™ - that they were not 
shipped out. That they did not - that they were
 not shipped out, that
 they are still around, 
and that they are in Majowka. So, of course
, now I™d met my father - not that I stayed 
with him, because me n were separated from
 women. And Father again went into the 
office to do book work for the _________.  And Hania remi nded me  that what happened 
later was that  Father  was sent to Ma jowka, 
or however it was, or 
Krysia was sent– How 
was it now?  I forget how it was, but anyhow, two 
of us were in Strzelnica, Father and I. 

Hania and Krysia were in Majowka. Later 
on, the camps were combined. And, of course, 
later on the camps were shifted again. But at th
is point, I was with my
 father, and that, of 
course, was a great consolation, even if I didn™
t stay with him, because he was with the 
me n™s group. I stayed with wome n who knew 
me , who knew the family, and looked after 
me  up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me. 
 
Q: Can we just go back?  
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: I™m trying to visualize 
the pictur e you™ve created. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You™re a child of
– 1942– You™re thirteen– 
 
A: Thirteen,yes. 
 
Q: –thirteen years old, and you™re
 seeing a level of violence - 
you™ve seen some  violence - 
but you™re seeing a leve
l of violence that–  
 
A: Neverever. 
 
Q: –exceeds anybody™s imagination. Do you scream when you see things?  
 
A: No,no. 
 
Q: You™re very quiet with your parents. 
 
A: I am scared. 
 
Q: You™re so scared– Right. 
 
A: I am scared out of my wits. I really, I c
ouldn™t scream. In fact, when we fi nally got to 
Strzelnica, and I didn™t know yet Father was ar
ound, I couldn™t yet cry 
- but I cried later - 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
37 
 
but I couldn™t yet cry because 
I was overwhelmed with fear. 
The terr or of it all and the 
fear, it™s sort of, you know, like you become  breat
hless. I was frozen in the fear of it all. 
And I must say, this was the fi rst time - the march to the square and then the march to 
Strzelnica - were my real first encounter 
with horror which I c
ould not avoid. You know, 
like when we were comi ng back from the woods, when the war broke out, I saw dead 

horses on the road. I didn™t see ever dead horse
s before, so I covered my eyes. I sort of 
covered my eyes, and I didn™t see the - I sa
w the dead horses were comi ng up, and there 
was a dead horse, so I covered my eyes. Bu
t later on, there was no way of covering your 
eyes, because the horror was such, and you had to watch yourself, and you had to stay in 

line and you had to ma rch as fast as you were
 told to. So that the overwhelming fear was 
sort of like paralysis, you know, paralysis 
of your brain. You don™
t think. You ma ke the 
motion, your body propels you, but it™s not the 
brain; it™s the fear
 that propels you, I 
guess. And later on, until I wound down enough to cry - it took awhile because I was out 

of my mi nd with fear be
cause, for the fi rst time in my entir
e life, I was alone, left in these 
circumstances, where all these years I was so prot ected. 
 
Q: This is going to be a strange question, but– 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you think you were afraid because you we
re alone or be cause you were vulnerable, 
because you saw how vulnerabl e,
 or was the two of them–? 
 
A: No, I was afraid because I was alone. Because
, first of all, because of what I saw, you 
know?  This was a shock to my system. Even if 
I were too mu ch (ph) with parents and my 
sisters, I would still be shoc
ked out of my wits to see th
e horror that I encountered 
between leaving the house and the selection 
in the square and the Strzelnica camp. I 
couldn™t cover my eyes and I couldn™t ma ke be
lieve it didn™t exist because I had to have 
my wits around me  to pay attention to 
everyt hing because, if some body fell under my  
feet, I couldn™t stumble. So, the entire pi
ctur e revolved around 
saving your life however 
you can, so you cannot disregar
d what™s happening around you. So, that™s 1942, and this 
is the rude awakening that is the point at
 which I was facing up to what is really 
happening, even though I wasn
™t yet told anything. 
 
Q: So, when you– Is the first person in your fa mily that you saw your father?  
 
A: Myfather. 
 
Q: And did you talk?  
 
A: Well, ma ybe  not. No, ma ybe waving or some thing. 
 
Q: Isee. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
38 
 
A: There was not yet, you know– We  were segreg
ated; he was in one group, but the fact is 
that he saw me  and I saw hi m and we wave
d. And then other people got in touch with 
other me n, so everybody said, ﬁO
h, Renia, your father said th
at he™s here and he™ll look 
after–ﬂ And you know, so people would send messa
ges that way.  So, that was the only 
thing. But of course he did not know what ha
ppened to my mo ther. But of course ma ybe 
he knew and didn™t tell me. Because my moth
er was supporting an elderly woma n. So if 
you really had any, any understanding of the 
situation, you knew that Mrs. Kalinyerska 
(ph) was not one to be going to slave 
labor because she was old. And my mother, 
supporting her, had to go with her. 
 
Q: So, one would assume  if that young ma n w
ho came out of the bushes - the story that 
Chris told - and if your parents really 
believed him as to what was happening in 
Treblinka, your father probably figured
 out where your mother probably went. 
 
A: I can tell you, my understanding of everything 
is that they knew much more than they 
ever let on, because they were intelligent 
people, aside from which, you know, my father 
was fluent in German. I n fact, he spoke and 
wrote and read German. He used to subscribe 
to German periodicals and su
ch. I doubt very much that my father didn™t know. I mean, 
that is impossible. But the fact that  he 
didn™t tell me, that is an absolute fact. 
 
Q: So, did you keep in your head that at 
some  point you would see your mother again?  
 
A: Yes. Absolutely. I kept it in my head th
at - because, you see, the word ‚resettleme nt™ was 
being bandied about. What that word meant di
dn™t quite - wa s never clarified, but they 
said ﬁThe resettlement to the east, the rese
ttleme nt–ﬂ The word ‚resettleme nt™. So, you 
know, you can always rationalize it. If you have 
already met the quota for slave labor for 
the Starachowice plant and the 
other factories nearby, then 
you resettle– I me an, on the 
child™s level, you can more or less follow their 
train of thought. The ot
hers were resettled 
to places which was needed other people, so
 that was resettleme nt. And by the same  
token, I couldn™t imagine that I wouldn™t see my mother again, so that was another thing. 
Hiding from the real possibility of what
 happened. I felt that way right along, you know?  
I knew I didn™t know. I knew what I didn™t know. 
I really realized, but
 I didn™t want to 
know. 
 
Q: So, how long did it take before you me t 
up with your sisters, do you think, about?  
 
A: I don™t really know, but my next recollecti
on of the camp wa s - yeah, I worked in the 
laundry, you know, I was assigned to the laundry. 
 
Q: That was right away? 
 
A: In Strzelnica, right away. So that I did not
 go to the factory anymore. I worked in the 
factory maybe a month at the most. I worked in
 the fa-– And my next recollection of the 
place was that Hania became  very - Hania must
 have already been in, because she had an 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
39 
 
extreme case of typhus. And I reme mber that, because selections were be ing ma de. We 
had to line up, and they told you to run, and whoever could not run fast enough was taken 

out and shot. People were taken - ten or twelve
 me n were told to dig a grave - and then 
people were taken over to the pit and shot. S
o, I do reme mber that Hania had such an 
extremely severe case of typhus, she was hallu
cinating and talking out 
of her head. I also 
had typhus but a mild form, so that, that was 
the one thing I reme mber so distinctly. And 
I me t here in Florida, I met a friend of mi
ne who worked with me
 in the laundry three 
years ago, and she said to me , ﬁYou know, Re
nia, you saved my mother™s life.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁI saved your mother™s 
life?  I never heard of anything like that.ﬂ And she says, 
ﬁ Well, what happened is when we worked 
in the laundry–ﬂ She and her mother worked 
in the laundry with me , a nd her mother had a 
severe case of typhus. And they called us 
out and told us to line up, a
nd she says that I stood - she put the mother between me  and 
her - her mo ther was a tiny little
 woma n; we were both taller 
than the mother and we held 
on to her and they passed by and didn™t not
ice and she survived. Whereas I know for a 
fact that he r mother saved my life because wh
en I had typhus, she told me  to stand over 
the cauldron where the steam was comi ng fr
om, because I was red, you know, feverish, 
so she says, ﬁ When they see you, they will know 
that it™s the steam.ﬂ 
And so it was - they 
opened the door and looked in and then if 
anyone was sick with typhus, and we were all 
over the cauldrons there, and when I turned my
 head, they saw me  all sweaty and red, and 
I was just one more slave worker doing laundry. 
So, that was actually, she - that was Mrs. 
Shacter (ph) - And so it was news to me  when
 she told me  I saved her mother™s life. But 
the fact is that selections were being 
ma de right along, and typhus sufferers were 
eliminated one by one. So, Hania mi r
aculously survived that selection. 
 
Q: What did you - what went through your h
ead when you saw these selections and people 
being killed because they were sick, or for 
some  other reason?  Did you think they were 
going to kill everybody? 
 
A: No, absolutely not. I just don™t know what I 
thought at that time. 
I just knew that time s  
were very ba d. And I just hoped ma ybe the wa
r would be over and how it will be  over, I 
didn™t know. I didn™t know who was fighting whom
, and where was the front or if there 
was the front, or the Germans were there to 
stay, or whatever. I 
just fi gured that it 
couldn™t go on forever, you know, one way or a
nother it has to end. And I just - I ma de 
no connections. In fact, I was really, truly - I 
was not an independent thinker in any such 

way that you could imagine me , planning or
– I probably understood what was going on 
very well. I understood it very well, because ho
rror is not ve ry hard to understand. It™s 
naked horror in front of your eyes, so you know what is happening. But how that related 

to the overall thing, I knew I was petrified. I li
ved in fear every second of my life. That I 

knew. After that, I couldn™t say 
that I ever coul d figure out th
e next day or the month later 
or if it will end - I knew it would end so
me ti me  - but how and when, no such thing. 
 
Q: Now, you were probably a little past 
the age of when a young girl would have 
me nstruated. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
40 
 
A: Oh, yes, not past the age, 
but, just to give you the quick 
overview, I went through all the 
camps - Aus c hwitz and Ravensbrück and Retzow
 and back home to Poland - and I still 
did not start. So, that was what
 you say called a delayed reaction. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: And of course, I was not developed and I 
lacked proper nutrition; 
I was a skinny child. 
 
Q: Did you know that you were supposed to me nstruate?  
 
A: But of course! 
 
Q: Yeah. And were you nervous
 about the fact that–?  
 
A: No, I was glad! 
 
Q: [chuckles] 
 
A: I was very, very happy - not happy, but I was glad because I feared - that was one extra 
fear, what would happen if and when I did, be
cause supplies were - 
if you can call them 
supplies - rags were hard to come  by. No, 
but I never had such a fear because nothing 
was happening and nothing did happen and I neve r developed until after the war. 
 
Q: Were you able to notice whether othe
r wome n were me nstruating in the ghetto?  
 
A: No, I know that they didn™t because in Au
schwitz - I rep
eat that like an ignoramus 
because I don™t know what it means - but in 
Auschwitz, they used to say that the soup, 
the so-called soup that we  were given, had 
brom
 in it. Now, I don™t know what 
brom
 is - 
and this was some  kind of a - whatever it 
was, a me dication or wh
at ever  -  t h at  t h at  
prevented women from menstruating. I have no id
ea, I am just repeat
ing it as I heard it. 
So, I know that the women did not me nstruate. Why, I wouldn™t know, and whether it 
was due to some  concoction or an agent or 
a chemical being put in the food, I couldn™t 
tell, but I knew that much. 
 
Q: Now, that™s a long-term myth, that
 they put in some thing in the food. 
 
A: Itis. 
 
Q: They put stuff in the foo
d, but not to stop me nstruation. 
 
A: So, ma ybe lack of nutrition–?  
 
Q: That™s why I was asking, in the ghetto ci
rcumstance and in the camp circumstance - you 
didn™t get it, but I wondered whet
her you noticed that other wo me n– 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
41 
 
 
A: I wouldn™t know. 
 
Q: You wouldn™t know?  
 
A: I know that I did not until 
way after we came ba ck to Poland, and I mean, way after. 
Maybe even later than that 
- ma ybe in Berlin in ™46. As far down the road as that. 
 
Q: And what was food like in the camp?  What
 did you get in the morning?  Did you get two 
meals, three meals, if on
e could call them meals? 
 
A: Would you believe that I really don™t reme mb
er? I know that we were fed. But, in those 
days, we were getting Pancheska (ph), the Pancheski (ph) family were sending, you 
know, they had some  of our better things, crysta
l, silver, and they were selling it off little 

by little and were sending in money. One of
 the husbands, actually, it was one of the 

sisters was ma rried to one of the me n who wo
rked in the factory - you know, one of the 
Pancheska (ph) sisters. There 
were four sisters, so one of
 the husbands - the husband of 
one worked in the factory, and he used to bring 
- Maria used to sell the stuff - and he used 
to bring the money. And she was the only 
one who never even wanted that stuff 
originally, but Mother  said those are things of sentimental value. In fact, after the war, 

whatever we had from home is from them. Y
ou know, those little Pa
ssover silver cups - 
Did Chris tell you about it?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yeah, so those things, she kept that she di
dn™t sell yet. Because, Genia (ph), the maid, she 
had really - she really wa nted everyt
hing, and she took everything. But you know, a 
sewing machine is not of sentimental value,
 and bedspreads and dr
aperies have not got 
sentimental value. So, she took it and it 
was her own, but Mrs. Pancheska (ph) took 

everything my parents had - you 
know, gifts, wedding gifts, a
nd such, silver - so, they 
kept it and sold whatever they felt thatwould bring in more money and that™s how we 

survived. 
 
Q: So, this was an unusual circumstance to have
 some body so close being able to get things 
in to you?  
 
A: Yes,yes. 
 
Q: And is it the case also that she was able to get medicine in when you had typhus?   
 
A: I don™t think so. 
 
Q: No?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
42 
 
A: No. Money was nothing. I mean, mo ney you can
 hide but you cannot 
hide things. And he 
used to give it - the husband of one of the 
sisters - used to give it to some body we knew 
and they would bring it fr om th
e factory, so that worked out. 
 
Q: Did they take away your clothes when you 
went into the - into the camp?  You had all 
these layers of clothes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do with them?  
 
A: No, in that camp, we kept 
our clothes. They didn™t give 
you - I don™t think so - not until 
Auschwitz. I think I wore my personal things. 
 
Q: And where did you sleep?  
 
A: In barracks. You see, Str
zelnica was what they call a shoo
ting range originally, and then 
they built a bunch of barracks ther
e, you see, so that is where one of the camps was made, 
was Strzelnica. Whereas - Now, whe n I went to Poland, in 1980, I asked - Pancheska™s 

(ph) granddaughter took us ther
e. I wanted to see Strzelnica. 
We ll, it™s back to a shooting 
range, you see. And some of the barracks wereleft over but not all. So, that was an area 

that was inside the woods, and the barracks 
- again, I can™t tell you whether they were 
built for us or built prior or however, but th
er e were barracks and we slept with wome n. 
 
Q: We need to take a break now, to change the tape.

Q: Renia, how would you describe your relati
onship with your two ot
her sisters at this 
point?  I me a n, they™re sort of– Do each of you ha
ve a different role at this point, I me an, 
could you describe it that way?  
 
A: In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no, becau
se as far as I™m concerned personally, I was 
always at the receiving end, meaning I rece
ived all the love, a
nd I received all the 
protection, and I received all the care and al
l everything. I was the one really who mo st 
likely contributed list to the ge
neral survival scheme , or what
ever you call it. I was on the 
receiving end of it most
 of the time. I adored my sister
s. Krysia, Chris, my next higher 
than I si ster, was always the practical ki
nd and always very wise in organizing and 
assessing, so– Hania was sort of in the clouds. 
She was very smart and very brilliant, but 
she was alwa ys sort of - she was catered t
o, you know. In those days, if you had a very 
smart person in the family, you had to defer 
to that person because you couldn™t disturb 
the genius at work. So, it sort of carried 
over to her– Not that she was a sponger of any 
kind - it™s just that she wa s really at a cer
tain level of higher existence that she didn™t 
really have to so much worry about everyday 
things. So that basically, Chris was the one 
who pulled the two of us toward the center, 
you see?  And Hania was ve
ry bright and very 
intelligent, and understood most everything bett
er than I do anytime, but we loved each 
other a whole lot, and the fact that we we
re now separated from our parents - now, I™m 
saying separated because we we
re still separated fr om our 
father but we knew he was 
around and saw him every now and then and woul
d wave to him, and we were separated 
from our mo ther because we 
really did not know what d
eath was all about. So, we 
deluded ourselves that, well, this resettle
me nt, whatever. Having seen so ma ny peopl e 
resettled from Lodz and from Austria in our
 own home town, we kne
w wh at resettleme nt 
was all about. People were being shifted he
re and there, and so Mother was shifted 
some where else, and everythi ng is going to co
me  out fine, because when everythi ng ends, 
she will show up. So, basically, we were even 
closer as a unit now than we ever were. 
And, I must say, I contributed only by the fact th
at I was there, and th
ey fe lt that they had 
to protect me , and so that was a little mo
re mortar to the binding. But I was not the 
planner; I wa s not a - I didn™t visualize th
ings in practical terms. I understood the 
situation very well, having now seen what 
was transpiring, but how that applied to 
anything; it really didn™t, not in my little 
world, because this was all st uff I didn™t know 
how to deal with. Besides, I had these two pr
otectors. First I had my two parents; I wa s 
always the tag-along. Now, Hania and Krysia were
 sort of protecting me . So, I just had to 
see that I stayed out of trouble, that I was al
ert at all times to what was around me , that I 
understood the danger, that I understood how 
to handle myself, you know?  And the rest, I 
knew I was being provided with
 the love and protection. And 
that truly was how I really 
survived the war. Not on my own account in a
ny way. I don™t take credit for survival at 
all, truly. That is how I actually saw myself
. I saw to it that I really should know wha t  

was going on and try to avoid getting into tr
ouble, meaning situations that had no exit.

Q: Why wouldn™t you consider 
that - I don™t want to call it 
a survival strategy - but why 
wouldn™t you consider that things that you 
actually did?  You had to watch, because– 
 
A: But I was not responsible for anybody but 
myself, don™t you see?  In the way we were 
brought up, watching out for yourself wasn™t thegreatest thing in the world that you wa nt 
to do, because you really always needed to th
ink of that other person. But by virtue  of 
being at the end of the line, 
and not being terribly attuned 
to realities and not being old 
enough to understand it all and put it together, 
I could understand the da
nger and the fear, 
but I coul dn™t relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special, because  I wasn™t 

doing anything for anybody. I was trying to keep 
myself alive by seei
ng that I survived, 
you know?  That™s about it. Not by harmi
ng anybody, not by doing anything special, but 
by just watching out, and of course, to keep cont
rol of the fear, which was a task of itself. 

Controlling your fear is extremely hard, if
 you see if your fear is legitimate, it™s 
extremely hard to do. 
 
Q: Could you control your fear?  
 
A: At certain times I could, at
 certain I could not. Li ke the 
time when I was alone going to 
Strzelnicacamp. But my fear
 was uncontrollable, but there was double fear of what 
would happen if I didn™t control mys e lf 
- because everybody was just falling by the 
wayside. You see, that much I understood. 
 
Q: Were there other kids about
 your age in the camp, as well?  
 
A: Oh,yes. 
 
Q: Therewere? 
 
A: Not only, you know, I imagine you must have h
eard about it. Not only were they in the 
camp, they were basically smuggled into the 
camp. They were outside the camp with 
Christians, or however they were smuggled. 
These kids eventually went to Auschwitz, 
survived Auschwitz, five and seven year old 
kids, survived Auschwitz, and one of them 

is still alive in Israel. But th
ree of these little kids that 
lived in camp, who went to Poland 
after, to Starachowice after th
e war, were killed in Starac
howice, so you heard about that. 
I think the name was - Hania remi nded me - Eisenmann (ph) - and Wolfowicz (ph) was 

the ma n that was the boss of the laundry wher
e I worked, so Wolfowicz (ph) I think had 
two children. They were in camp, you see, he
 smuggled them in and they lived in the 
back of the laundry or whatever, but I kne
w of the Wolfowicz (ph) kids. And they 
survived the evacuation to Auschwitz, they 
survived Auschwitz, and everything that 
came after, and they came  back to Poland, a
nd they were killed after the war in Poland. 
 
Q: Do you have any idea why they smuggled the 
kids into the camp from the s e places they 
were being hidden?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
45 
 
A: I don™t know. I just knew, because they were
 in a position to get them in, because they 
bribed some one or some thing. I know that 
Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) was my boss in the 
laundry, and his kids - he had two kids - 
so, I don™t know how ma ny there was - I don™t 
know, less than ten - and they did survived. They were five-year-old kids. 
 
Q: But how about children your age, young adults?  
 
A: Yeah, they were, they were, some  of 
them survived, down in Israel, of course. 
 
Q: So, the contact that you had during the day 
- you™re at the laundry most of the day?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So, you don™t see your sisters beca
use they™re working elsewhere?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So, do you have friends 
outside your two sisters? 
 
A: Oh, yes, yes, my peers. For example, the 
girl in the laundry, Rach
elka Shacter (ph), she 
was a very good friend. Then I had my Hani
a Tenser (ph), she was the one who came 
from Israel to testify that she was in the ga
s chamber, and she was my friend. Yes, I had - 
you know - they were all kids, but you know, a 
fourteen, thirteen y
ear old kid can work 
pretty well in the laundry, believe me, and that
 was just as well slav
e labor as anything. 
 
Q: Now, I™ m going to go back to a question I asked you a long time  ago, because you 
interpreted it some what differently than 
I had intended it. Do you now, when you™re in 
the laundry, in some  sense reap
 the benefits of having been 
in school with your sister 
teaching you, because you kept learning thin
gs? Did these things go through your head?  
Do you replay the books in your head, and poetry?  
 
A: Oh, yes, mo st of all poetry. I am ab
solutely crazy about poetry. And, you know, the 
amazing thing is that the emphasis on learning th
ings by rote, by heart, was very strong in 
my schooling years, and Hania kept on the sa
me  way, so I actually reme mber a whole lot 
of Polish poetry, I reme mber sections of 
Shakespeare in Polish, and you know, in the 

hardest of times - to this day 
I can recite poetry that I woul
dn™t even believe that I would. 
There is a Polish epic, 
Pan Tadeusz
, that of course I must have read a million times now 
already, but I do read it - it™s on
e of the greatest works. Anyw
ay, I went to see the movie 
based on that - it was released about two y
ears ago, by Andrzej Wa jd
a, the director, and 
they stuck very close to the sc
ript and used at least 80% of
 the poetry as was the epic. I 
was sitting in the movie with Victor - of 
course, Victor doesn™t speak Polish, but he 
enjoyed the movie subtitles - and I am 
reciting with the movi e, I am reciting 
Pan Tadeusz
 
because I exactly know what™s going to come. 
And he walks into this room and he looks 
around and he sees the grandfather clock, and 
he recites this poem
 about his connection 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
46 
 
to the grandfather clock, and I am going right
 along with him, a
nd I know one line ahead 
of hi m all the time. So, those things sustai
ned me, definitely. And 
I didn™t see it - again, 
it™s a connection, where it™s going to lead me
. Thi s was like nouris
hment; perhaps that™s 
how I should have put that - th
at learning for its own sake, 
if it was pleasurable, was the 
greatest pleasure. So, when you™re down and out
, what else but to draw on this some thing 
that was so pleasurable. And it was personal, 
intimate, because you didn™t have to find a 
book, you didn™t have to rely on the movies or
 on other people - all you had to do was 
start reciting in your head that poem - and ther
e were so ma ny, because we were forced to 
me morize good poetry, really. So, that was, to th
is day, I absolutely have every piece of 
poetry that I love, I have it 
now, and I re-read it, strangely
 enough. I enjoy it and I enjoy 
it and there is no end to the enjoyment, and that
 could have been part of what I call this 
lifting up the soul. Again, you see, it doesn™t
 - I™m sorry that 
I don™t answer, didn™t 
answer your question to your satisfaction. 
 
Q: No, no, no, no, no - that™s not what I said. Y
ou interpreted it differently; it wasn™t that 
you didn™t answer it to my satisf
action. It™s just that I had a 
slightly different intention, 
and it was very interesting to hear where you took it. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But perhaps I asked it too early. Asking you now
 is ma ybe more appropriate. Is there any 
poem that you recall repeating to 
yourself a lot there, that yo
u could repeat for us, that 
was really important?  
 
A: No, no, mos tly it was Mickiewicz or Tu wi m - I don™t know if you™ve heard of hi m. 
Mickiewicz was a 19
th
 century poet of Polish origin, but
 Lithuanian, he came  out of, 
when Lithuania was part of - heavily Polis
h. But Tuwi m was contemporary, and he wrote 
children™s poems, and he was a Jew, a Polish Jew. And his poetry was very much taught 
in schools. Mickiewicz, of course, and ther
e was Slowacki, and there were all other 
important poets, but they were 18
th
/19
th
 century poets. Twentieth century poet was Julian 
Tuwin, who was a Jew by birth, a
nd every kid knew his poetry. 
In fact, when our parents 
had company and they wanted to show off 
the kid, they would come  and say, ﬁHey, hey, 
say that locomotive poem by Tuwi m.ﬂ You showed off that because it wa s such beautiful 

poetry. And, so I have Tuwi m, I have him. 
Unfortunately, I didn™t 
quite agree with the 
way his life turned out, because he sort of 
- he came to America during the war and then 
went back to Communist Poland. He had left
 this _______. Not that it means anything in 
the broader sense. He was nevert
heless the greatest poet of the 20
th
– one of the great, 
outstanding Polish poets of the 20
th
 century was Julian Tuwim. They™re trying to 
rehabilitate him now, but hi
s poetry lives on, so who cares, 
whatever the background. So, 
you know, all of those little poems and big poems
 would come back, and they gave you a 
semblance of continuity of some thing that wa
s, ma ybe you didn™t lose 
it yet.  If you could 
reme mber that poem that your mother made 
you recite at that party, you know, and the 
connection, you see?  And of course, you know
, children, you had to curtsey for your 
parents™ friends; you had to curtsey. So, wh
en you came to make a big presentation, she 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
47 
 
called you in, you had to curtsey and say the po
em, and then would curtsey and walk out. 
So, if it was possible, which it was, to ma
ke the mental connection from the present 
situation which I found myself in 
to this thing that was once sort
 of part of the other life, 
that was great. And if you call it 
the thread that sustains you, fi
ne, but that™s what it really 
was. 
 
Q: Were there any situations where there was 
a public sharing of poetr
y or singing in the 
camp that you reme mbe r?  
 
A: Yes, a lot of times, because, as I told 
you, Polish education required you to know certain 
poems , period. That™s it. So, this is how it wa
s, that if you started, some body else chimed 
in, some body else sung. There wa
s a lot of singing; it was good. 
 
Q: In the camp ?  
 
A: In the camp, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you sleep with your sisters?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the same barrack? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: So, in the evening, you would be
 together. And were they able
 to get in touch with your 
father more regularly than you?  
 
A: Yes, we saw Father, yes. He slept elsewhere,
 but he was working in the little office, so 
we could always see him. 
 
Q: How do you reme mber him doing?  
 
A: He was doing fine, because we were 
around. But people told us - people fr om 
Starachowice who survived the war and Ausc
hwitz, whom we met after the war - they 
said that the mi nute he came to Auschwitz
, he was another ma n. Father, according to 
accounts of other people that knew him, he 
perished in October, you see, we came to 
Auschwitz at the end of July; he perished in
 October. They said he aged so, and he 

totally, he was totally di sheartened. He was totally - he felt completely lost . Maybe he by 

then knew - he could have known about my mo
ther. I don™t know. But then, of course, he 
didn™t have us anymore. He 
knew we were some where in there, but he didn™t really 
know. They said that his legs swelled up a
nd he was gone. He perished in Auschwitz. 
 
Q: Was he gassed, do you know?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
48 
 
 
A: Oh, yes, I™m sure. 
 
Q: Do you know about how old he was by the ti
me he got to Auschwitz?  Would he have 
been in his 50s?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there a warning that there would be 
an evacuation at the camp; that you were going 
to be deported out of the camp?  
 
A: Out of Strzelnica camp to Auschwitz?  We ll, you 
see, I mi ght as well bring in the fact that 
we were not evacuated from Strzelnica and Ma
jowka. We were evacuated from a totally 
different camp. 
 
Q: Oh, so describe it. 
 
A: Well, the munitions factory had a siding, 
you know, because to deliver and take out the 
stuff by train. At a certain time, at a certain 
point in 1944, in July or
 so, mi ddle of July, 
we were resettled to yet another camp, but very
 near the muni tions factory, next to the 
siding, the railroad siding, and that camp wa
s the last camp in Starachowice from which 
the evacuation to Auschwitz took place. That 
is where the break-out was, the rebellion 
and the break-out. That is where we were lo
aded on the train for Auschwitz, which is not 

Strzelnica and it™s not Majowka, 
but it™s the third place whic
h I don™t even know if it had 
a name , but it was the closest in location physic
ally to the mu nitions factor y because  the 
railroad, the railroad tracks were right ther e,
 and that™s where we were loaded to go to 
Auschwitz. 
 
Q: And how long were you relocated in that place?  
 
A: That I don™t know, I really don™t know. 
 
Q: Do you think, days, weeks?   
 
A: No, days, maybe a week or two at most. And 
this was a transient type of - I can™t even 
say it was camp. It had barbed wire, or it 
had a wooden fence, whatever - it was 
surrounded by a fence, and it had guards, guard
 towers, you see, because that was very, 
this was so near to the factory that this 
was really probably war 
production area anyway, 
but they had guards, and they had Ukrainians
 in them. And this is where, and I don™t 
know, Chris or Hania would reme mber bett
er how long we stayed, but this was 
absolutely not a camp that we lived in because by then we didn™t work anymore. 
 
Q: I see. So, both camps we re emptied–?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
49 
 
A: –emptied to the third, into the third. N
o, even before then, those two camps were 
combined. You know, I really forgot how the 
combination we nt. Firs
t it was Strzelnica 
and Majowka, then it was no more St rzelni
ca, it was only Majowka, and then I think, 
then it was the third camp, but it was physically another place. 
 
Q: But you don™t reme mber  quite the timing of Strzelnica?  
 
A: Strzelnica,no. 
 
Q: Strzelnicaturning–?  
 
A: No, I don™t know. Hania and Chris would 
probably reme mber it better. But I do know 
that we did not go to Auschwitz
 out of Strzelnica and not out
 of Majowka, but out of the 
third pl ace. 
 
Q: So, you™re there for a few days, you think– 
 
A: Let™s say a week or so. 
 
Q: A week, and then trains come . 
 
A: Yeah, and they load us on the trains. 
 
Q: And of course nobody announces to you where you™re going.  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, are you afraid again?  
 
A: The one thing that I absolutely never lost 
was fear. That is one thing that followed me  
right through the war. Fear was sort of like,
 like your skin. Skin is part of your body, and 
fear is another aspect of that. And we ju
st, I don™t know that we knew that Auschwitz 
existed. I didn™t; I don™t know who 
knew. I just know that wh
en we were being loaded, 
however that was arranged, Father™s train, th
e car on the train, and ours were adjacent, 
meaning whether his was the last of the men™s wa gons and we were the first of the 
wome n™s or the other way around. I don™t know. I 
just reme mber that when we arrived in 
Auschwitz, when they unloaded us on the plat
form, that as soon as the wome n ca me  out 
of this wagon, we saw the group of me n comi ng 
out of that one that was adjacent to us, 
and that was the last time we saw him. 
 
Q: How was the trip?  
 
A: That was most horrendous. Horrendous isn™
t the word, because it was summertime, you 
know, it was the end of July 1942–  No, what am 
I saying, it wasn™t ™42, of course not - 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
50 
 
™44! We ™re talking now, of course, this is th
e Russian offensive that has started, so the 
Germans are emptying all these labor camps 
and they are sending people westward. And 
we of course have no idea how the war is progressing, or at least I 
don™t. Because I really 
am living on another planet. I just want to 
survive. I™m full of fear and I™m trying to 
ma nage, but other than that, I really don™t 
have any idea what is happening. The only 

thing is that some thing bad is happeni ng to 
the Germans because now there are si gns that 
they are a little scared, you know?  So, when 
we are loaded on those trains, I don™t know 
that we know that we™re going to Auschwitz or
 I don™t even know that
 - I mean, I didn™t - 
I didn™t even know that Auschwitz
 existed, but I figured if ther
e is a war and the soldiers 
are moving closer, ther e will be soldiers fi ghting with soldiers. Maybe they want us out 

of the - you know, this is another type of pi
pe dream kind of t hing. There was no water, 
you know. People were dying. There was shouting 
for the water, it was just horrendous. 
You know, I always think, was it th
e fact that I was so skinny
 that I survived?  Really, I 
didn™t require, you know, I wasn
™t hungry like other people,
 and my body didn™t require 
fuel the way some  other people™s bodies requ
ired fuel. There could be some thing to it, 
you know?  So, anyhow, when we arrived in Ausc
hwitz, 1944, I think it 
was either end of 
July or early August. And then we found out 
in Auschwitz that other camps were being 
evacuated from all over, meaning east of 
Auschwitz. You know, our camps, our camp - 
Majowka/ St rzelnica - Starachowice was located
 in central Poland w
ithin that industrial 
district, and there were othe
rs - there was Skarzysko-Kami
enna, there was Radom, there 
were other camps that were now being all evacuated. And we knew, for example, that the 

Radom transport arrived. And one day we saw 
my Aunt Rose in Auschwitz, passing by - 
we were carrying rocks this way and they 
were carrying rocks th
e other way - so we 
knew that all these other camps - we didn™t know
 that Aunt Rosa was alive, but we saw 
her in Auschwitz - so we knew, the word 
spread, that all these camps were being 
liquidated, so we could figure out some thi
ng wasn™t going too well for the Germans, 
and– 
 
Q: Before we take a break with the tape, wh
en you arrived in Auschwitz, was it as awful an 
arrival as your ma rketplace experience?  
 
A: Oh, yes, except for me  personally, Hania a
nd Krysia were there to protect me . In the 
ma rketplace, I was all alone and younger. You se
e, I™m a little older now, and of course, I 
have already learned to cope a little. Not th
at I was a lost soul, no. I was resilient in a 
self-preservation type of way but I wasn™t ye
t totally what you call 
clever about things. 
But, no, when we arrived in Auschwitz, we 
were the three of us. 
The interesting thing 
was, of course, which we didn™t know befo
re but we now know, but most of those 
transports, the last mi nute transports of 
people shipped out of the slave labor camps, 

whether there was no time or whatever, they we
re not subject to selection. This is why 
the five-, seven-year-old kids survived Auschw
itz. We were just herd
ed out, put into the 
so-called showers, given, thrown the clothe
s that they gave us, you know?  Our hair was 
chopped off - I didn™t say cut off, I say chopped o
ff - so that we realized that the situation 
was quite different. Because little children a
nd older wome n and people were already just 
shoved in all at once, from all over - Skar
zysko, from Radom,  from Wostrowiecz (ph) .

to stop now and change the tape.

Tape #7
 
 
Q: I was just thinking that y
our mi ddle-childhood years, from 10 to 15, is all during this 
horrible period. You™re 15 years old when you enter Auschwitz.  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: It™s quite extraordinary tothink of that, isn™t it?  When I 
asked you about the entrance into 
Auschwitz, was there a lot of beating when 
you were taken off the railroad car, or was it 
more quiet?  Do you have a recolle
ction of that immediate time ?  
 
A: No, I don™t, no, the only thing 
I reme mber distinctly having se
en Father on the platform. 
But after that , I remember they were rushing 
us much in the so-called shower room or 
whatever you call that. And 
ma ybe Hania, Anna, would te
ll you about how she objected 
to being pushed and shoved and screamed at
 and for that they shaved off her hair, 
whereas our hair was just chopped off. Th
ey grabbed you by the hair, they put the 
scissors to it, and however it
 came it came, but they didn™t 
shave your head, they didn™t 
give you a haircut, they just chopped off so
me  hai r , whereas Ha nia and her friend Irene 
Muller, Irka Muller (ph), who is
 now Irene Ross, both very ta
ll, Hania was with her and 
objected to the fact that she was being pushe
d on and screame d, and said, ﬁDon™t talk to 
me  like this.ﬂ So, the woma n in charge, sh
e was a Czechoslovak woma n, she said, ﬁJust 
for that, I™ll show you what I can do.ﬂ And sheput her on the side there, and they shaved 

off her hair and Irene™s hair
 - total zero, you know, comple
te bald - and we burst out 
laughing, in total hysterics. We  
thought it was just so funny, b
ecause the fun in it was not 
the fact that the hair was shaved, but because
 they were both tall and little heads on the 
top, you know, the pin on top. And it was so grotes
que that it really le
nt itself to absolute 
hilarity in these circumstances, 
so we just laughed ourselves hi
lariously silly to tears. And 
we left that area, as we were all herded out. 
We left  that  area with Hania shaved to zero 
and Krysia, Chris, and I just 
having our hair, as I said, ju
st chopped off however, and– 
 
Q: So, your bodily hair was not shaved. Only– 
 
A: No, I had no bodily hairs. I don™t remember
, but I guess not. But we were tattooed right 
then and there, too. 
 
Q: So, you had your clothes off. You we
re nude when they cut your hair?  
 
A: I think so. I think so. And we were tattooed, 
and I really always stress the fact that we 
lined up together for tattooing so that we
 had consecutive numbers, which really 
contributed to our survival as a unit, th
e three of us. Because, you know, not having a 

name , you a r e always referred as a number, 
and when they call X numbe r of people for 
detail or work some where, you happen to be 
in the same  unit of numbers, so that was 
lucky. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
53 
 
Q: Do you still have your tattoo?  
 
A: Absolutelyyes. 
 
Q: Did you ever think of taking it off?  
 
A: No, not only did I never thought of it, but I 
was trying - I was absolutely almost forced 
into doing it, which I very much objected
 to. You know, during my early years in 
America, I used to work in the summers as 
a babysitter, as a governess. So, I went to a 
hotel in the Catskills with 
a doctor™s wife, you know, he was 
a surgeon - a plastic surgeon 
- and they had two children - one girl was 
about four and a baby like eight months old. 
And the mot her used to be there with thetwo kids in a bungalow on the hotel premises 
and we used to eat in the dining room, but we
 lived separately, and the husband used to 
come  for the weekends. Well, anyhow, when 
he discovered I had - I got the job through 
high school, through my  high school, but that is
 another story, but an
 interesting story. 
But anyhow, I go to this camp, and it was in 
Wi ngdale, New York. And of course I had 
came to mee t  them, and then the doctor used 
to come  for the weeke
nd, and he noticed my 
number. He said, ﬁYou know, I am a plastic 
surgeon. I™d like to remove this number.ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁNo, I don™t want to remove it.ﬂ 
So, he says - he thought - you know, those 
were my salad (ph) days - and he says, ﬁL
isten, I will not charge you, you have nothing to 
worry about. I will do a fine job and it won™
t cost  you a penny. After, you come  back to 
New York, you come  to my office and I™ll 
do it for you for free.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I don™t 
want to do it.ﬂ And I wouldn™t do it. And he sa
id to me , ﬁ Why would you want to have it?  

Why on earth would you want to keep it?  
You™re a young girl. Why on earth would you 
want to keep it? ﬂ  I said, ﬁWell, I have brow
n eyes, they™re a part of my body. That™s a 
part of my body, too, and I™m staying with 
it.ﬂ So, I kept it, and of course I never 
regretted it, never. 
 
Q: Was it humiliating to have th
e tattoo put on?  Did it hurt you? 
 
A: Oh, yes it was painful. You know, they pulled on the skin. By the way, we had very 
ﬁelegantﬂ numbers, quote-unquote, ﬁelegantﬂ, 
because I know people who got there much 
earlier than we did. They 
have these horrendous looking numbers - a ‚7™ crooked, an ‚8™ 
was some thing else. By the time we got ther
e, which was, as the war progressed, it was 
really toward the end of the war already, they
 had such fine experi
ence in tattooing that 
our numbers, Hania™s, Kr ysia™s and mi ne, ar
e in perfectly beautiful sequence - even, 
really even - so that we don™t have these 
numbers that others had on the outside, these 

humungous - we have these elegant numbers be
cause they had all these - and by the way, 
I have the second serial. My num
ber begins with an ‚A™ becaus
e they ran out of the first 
series of numbers, and they started an ‚A™ series.  
 
Q: So, when you get tat-– You™re shave
d, you get tattooed, and then the clothes. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
54 
 
A: The clothes were thrown at you. Wha t ever ha
ppens to be, whatever - size does not ma tter. 
You get what you got and shift for yourself. 
If you were a size 5, you get size 27, and if 
you™re size 12, you get size 6, and after that you 
have to go and exchange with others. 
And those were rags basicall
y, rags. I mean you know, stuff - 
I understand now that they 
were shipping out to Germany, good clothes and 
such, so whatever was left in the piles 
was really second-hand already. 
 
Q: Were they filthy?  
 
A: Actually, I don™t know. I don™t think so becau
se I imagine they must have steamed them 
for lice. There was always vermin in there. 
 
Q: When did you find out that this was Ausc
hwitz and what Auschwitz was? Wa s it very 
soon after your arrival?  
 
A: Oh, yes, absolutely, by then there was no hi
ding from the truth. Because, first of all, you 
saw the crematories. I think by then there 
no five crematories left. I think by then, 
because you know, some  of the crematories 
were destroyed by whatever means. The 
point of it is we were not 
burned. There was no selection for burning or for gassing. We 
were just brought in as a unit and shipped into
 Birkenau as a unit, 
and all the other camps 
- of course, we realized why this was happe
ning. There were just too ma ny camps being 
emptied into Auschwitz to be able to run the en
terprise as they did be
fore, with selections 
and such. So that when we came, you coul
d smell - you could see the fire out of the 
chimney. And of course, burning flesh hasa very strong odor th
at is nothing like 
anything else that you know. So, that was 
unmistakable, the burning of human bodies, 
unmi stakable.  
 
Q: Did you know at the time th
at there were huge numbers of
 Hungarian Jews being brought 
in? 
 
A: Yes, we discovered that a
nd, you know, my me mory of all this
 is sort of hazy, but I do 
know that there was a gypsy camp not far from
 our barracks because they talked about 
the gypsies, and we heard that the Hungarians 
we re being shipped in, too, at the same  
time. But you see, this was already very - 
I don™t know how they 
brought out people to 
Auschwitz as far as numbers, but I am sure 
with the German system, the way they run 
everything to the last detail, they probably 
spaced these transports. Now it was just one 
after the ot he r, but the Russian offensive wa
s really nearing to Auschwitz. I mean, you 
know, the Russians stopped at the Vistula River, and that was another political treachery 
(ph), but who knew then that Stalin wouldn™
t cross the Vistula, but they were comi ng. 
The Russians were comi ng from the east, so a
ll these camps - we were, after all, located 
not far from the Vistula, not all that far, so
 anyhow–  I mean, not as near as Krakow or 
other cities that were on the Vi
stula, but we were within th
e area that could be contacted 
very quickly.  However, they didn™t because Stalin sat himself down and waited for the 

Germans to finish off the job. So, all these 
camps  that were being emptied, we realized 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
55 
 
that some thing was happening from t he east.
 But how much c ould you know when you™re 
living behind barbed wires, and now you™re comi ng here, and you see all these other 
camps, Radom, and everybody else is there. 
 
Q: You were put into a quarant
ine camp for the first month?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember what barrack it wa s?  Do you have any recollection?  
 
A: No, no, the only thing I reme mber is that 
after the war, in 1987, 
and I was there with 
Chris, that we went to see the barrack, 
so then I knew that was the barrack. But I 
reme mber the barrack as a barrack in the in
terior, but if you ask me  what number it was 
and to find it in the complex, I 
couldn™t, but I was there in 1987. 
 
Q: How did you understand what a quarantine camp was?  What was that supposed to mean, 
ﬁquarantine barrackﬂ?  
 
A: Well, I™ll tell you, all these fancy words of
 ﬁquarantineﬂ and all this other thing, you only 
knew that there were all kinds of new horrors
 comi ng, so one horror was of this nature 
and one horror was of that nature. Personally, 
as I told you, I could not figure out what it 
led to or what it led from or how it figured 
in the larger picture. 
I didn™t know if they 
meant to keep us there for a month or for a 
year or forever or whatever. But having now 
acquired enough experience to see that nothing is
 certain, that nothing is permanent, that 
everything changes, and it always changes 
for the worse, because so far in our 
experience, nothing changes for the better. It
 was all downhill and by some  mi racle, we 
ma naged to stay together, which was alt
ogether a mi racle, altogether the most 
unbelievable mi racle. So, that 
we knew was a lucky break, th
at one, but everything else 
was just pure horror. And this was just a
nother thing, and God only knows what the next 
thing was going to be. And that horrendous sm
ell of burning flesh was really– well, sort 
of like very ominous in the sense that that 
is ma ybe after all going to be, you know, the 
final, the final, the tail end part of th
is horrible journey, who knows - we didn™t know. 
 
Q: Do you recall the mo me nt that 
you found out about the gas chambers?  
 
A: Oh, we were told right away. The old-timers 
were there, of course. They said, ﬁThey burn 
people here. They ship them in, they burn them all the time.ﬂ Of course, no question! 

How could you not know?  I mean, even if you didn™t know, you saw the flame. 

Generally, if you drive by the Jersey Turnpi
ke, you see the smoke comi ng out, whether it 
is acrid smoke or whatever it is, it™s smoke, 
it™s belching black or wh
ite or whatever . This 
was fire, you see?    
 
Q: Notsmoke. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
56 
 
A :  Not s moke; t his was fire. You sa w, i n the 
dark of t he night, this  lumi nous  ba ll of fire 
against the  dark sky. It was unmista ka ble. You 
couldn™t call it a nything else. This  wa s light 
fire. Now, this light fire a l so had an overpo
wering stench. And now, 
here you ha ve the  old-
timers who tell you this
. No w,  ho w much more
 ca n you - do you ne ed
 to fi gure out what 
was going on?  
 
Q: So, did they also tell you th
ings to avoid?  Did you get cl
ues about how one could survive 
in this thing?  That  ther e was a way–? 
 
A: No, no. Because - I don™t reme mber the seque
nce of things, but I remembe r  there were 
some  girls who ran away, who escaped from Aus c hwitz at that time, and they were 
brought back and they were hung. So, we al
ready knew, you know, like the hanging in 
Poland on the square for the Christians to 
see when they came out, so we already knew 
that such tactics lead to ot her things, that 
this was just a warni
ng but watch out because 
you™re next. 
 
Q: Did you see the bodies?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just heard about it?  
 
A: I heard about it. 
 
Q: So, in the first month or two, do you three ta
lk about this situatio
n?  Try to figure out–?  
 
A: We talked all the time. First of all, we
 sleep nine to a bunk. It is very hard to 
accommodat e  nine people to a bunk, so we had to talk. You ha ve nine people herded into 

one place, you have to talk. You talk because 
at a certain time , you ca
n™t even step down; 
you have to be up in your bunk. So, obviously some
 are old-time rs - although we are still 
traveling - so-called traveli
ng, quote-unquote - we  are still 
within the Starachowice group 
because we were shipped as a unit, and we 
were placed as a unit. Of course, we are 
mi xed in with others, of course, but we
 still have some  of these people from 
Starachowice with us. And we were nine 
to a bunk, so all of 
us couldn™t be all 
greenhorns; some  of them have already previous knowledge of
 what this place is about 
and what™s happening. So, now there are no secr ets; now we know the truth. And I think I 

myself for the first time am beginning to rea
lize that all these things I was trying to 
explain away - you know, this is now 1944, and 
for the last two years, ™42-™44, it is 
always downhill, it is downhill, 
it is downhill, but now this could very we ll be the end of 
the downhill, but this is more than the imag
ination will allow. I reme mber being very 
scared in Auschwitz, very, very scared, because
 I thought that was the end, I really di d. 

But by that time I think my attitude was a li
ttle di fferent, you know?  Sort of accepting of 
whatever was going to happen. Because, you 
know, by now, we still didn™t know about 
Mother, we didn™t know. I mean, everybody could 
figure out that she di
dn™t survive, but 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
57 
 
we didn™t know. And what happe
ned to Father we didn™t know either, so now we™re just 
the three of us, and whatever awaited us af
ter this we didn™t know, because we had no 
idea where the war was heading, which way. We  knew it wasn™t good for the Germans, 
but that™s about it. 
 
Q: Do you have nightma res?  
 
A: Did I have then?  No. 
 
Q: Youdidn™t? 
 
A: No, I didn™t have nightma res, no. 
 
Q: Were you able to sleep okay?  
 
A: Oh,yes! 
 
Q: Really? 
 
A: If you were ma de to carry heavy rocks a
nd then be a skinny kid, you were exhausted! 
Too exhausted not to sleep. Besi
des, there™ s something to be 
said for being squeezed in 
with all these bodies. You know, you cannot
 toss and you cannot scream, because 
some body is  going to poke you right away and, 
ﬁHey.ﬂ Maybe I had nightmares, but they 
didn™t allow me to have nightmares because
, when you™re squeezed between two other 
bodies, how would you be able to thrash ar
ound or yell or scream
?  Somebody™s going to 
go, ﬁHey, shut up, you,ﬂ or whatever. 
 
Q: Was it quiet in the barrack or was it noisy?  Do you reme mber ?  Smelly?  
 
A: Well, it wasn™t clean– I really don™t reme
mber - I just reme mber the upper bunk is 
where we were at. 
 
Q: You were in the upper bunk, so that was good. 
 
A: I reme mber that. But there was nothing on th
e wood itself. A pallet, 
I think, but there was 
very little. 
 
Q: Was there an oven in the mi ddle?  
 
A: I think so. But that I know from havi ng gone back now to take a look. 
 
Q: When did - I don™t know the chronology, so 
I ma y be asking the question too soon - when 
did the incident with the boots happe
n?  Wa s this before you were in 
Effektenkammer
 or 
after? 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
58 
 
 
A: You mean whose boots?  Hania™s boots?  
 
Q: No, when you were asked to clean the boots of the– 
 
A: Oh, yes. No, that was exactly the time; that
 was exactly the time, inside the barrack, right. 
That was Aranka. She was the head of the 
barrack. And you know the latrine was outside. 
To go to the latrine, you had to have permi
ssion. To get permission, and there were only 
X number of people could go at one time  so you 
were allowed in this group of three. So, 
whatever, I was going to the la
trine, and she caught me comi
ng back to the vestibule - 
Aranka who was as big as a horse and as 
fierce looking as the Gestapo themselves. She 
was a Czech girl, Czechoslovak. And she wa
s wearing these black
 boots - ridi ng boots - 
and she dragged me  over. She says to polis
h those boots with my spit, and I was so 
terribly offended, but I knew I could pay with
 my  life if I didn™t, because she was so 
powerful and so fat and so big and I was a skin
ny kid, and one blow from her, that would 
have been the end. But I was so incensed about 
it. I reme mber that I 
always think about it 
in the se nse of how stupid it was for me  to ge
t myself so worked up over it. Because  from 
what I had already experienced and seen, I s
hould have known that this is just one more 
humiliation, but it isn™t of such great importa
nce that it should ma ke - I cried over it 
because, of course, she put her foot up on 
the stool, and I stood there on my knees 
polishing her boots and spitting and I had very li
ttle spit to spit with, and of course she 
would have killed me. And I felt so hu miliated and offended and I never got over it for 
the longest time . And I knew as I told you that 
this was out of proportion to the reality. It 
seems, as I survey my war experiences, that
 always it was that  particul ar instance, it 
wasn™t the general, you know?  The specific a
nd personal was the one 
that stayed with 
me . For having seen all these things and 
having experienced othe
r people™s horrible 
experiences right next to me , those other things really count 
for very little, except that I 
could really have paid with my life. But it wa
sn™t so much the fear for my l i fe, but the 
humiliation that she was not 
German, you see?  I had alrea
dy accepted that anythi ng that 
had to do with the Nazis was dreadful and to 
be avoided, but the s
ource wa s different. In 
other words, it was comi ng from a Czech woman that the humiliation was double because 

I had yet not accepted that aside of the Nazis, there were ot he r people who could do that. 

So, I was just absolutely - it destroyed me . 
But it really didn™t amount to much. I did 
survive it, so– I polished her boots and I™m su re she never knew which one of those ugly 

looking people I was. So, there were 
no repercussions to it in a sense. 
 
Q: So, she didn™t take it out on you later?  
 
A: No, because I did do the job, there™s no que
stion. I was down on my knees, and she was 
towering over me . I tell you, once ki
ck and I could have been gone. 
 
Q: Does this situation in some  way remind 
you of the situation your 
mother told you about 
with respect to your father?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
59 
 
A: Absolutely, yes, absolutely, it was exactly 
the same . And the German said to her, ﬁThese 
aren™t gentleme n, these are Jews. And that 
Father became so humiliated. Of course, he 
was sweeping the rail station. It wa
s very, very upsetting to him. 
 
Q: Was this Czech wo ma n Jewish?  
 
A: I really don™t know. Her name  was Aranka; 
everybody was scared to death of her because 
her physical presence was r
eally very– threatening. And 
she had a very loud voice and 
screamed a lot. I was alwa ys afraid of her, 
but this is not why I felt humiliated, I think. It 
was because she was not German. Because by then
 I started realizing that it is not the 
Nazis only that I have to fear
; I have found a new source of fear that I have to watch out 
for, and I could only handle that muc h. 
 
Q: It gets bigger and bigger. 
 
A: Yeah, the circle, so to sa
y, is getting enlarged, and now 
I have other things to worry 
about, because just because she™s not a Nazi 
doesn™t mean she can™t ki ll me, ‚cause she 
can, and get away with it. 
 
Q: We™ll have to take a 
break to change the tape. 
 
End of Tape #7
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Tape #8
 
 
Q: Let me  go back to Majowka for a mome nt, b
ecause I realize that - 
I wonder if there are 
any comparable incident s for you in Majowka - not necessarily of being humiliated, but 
ma ybe humi liated or beaten, or 
were there people that you were
 as afraid of in Majowka 
as you were in Auschwitz?  
 
A: You know, I don™t really reme
mber, but I do know that I fe
lt - probably, I would guess I 
would have felt less fear in Majowka than in Auschwitz because Majowka was still 

Starachowice and Father was still on the 
premises and it was really hometown, my 
home town, even though there was no semblance 
to life or home  or anything, this was the 
place that wa s a familiar - not the camp, but the town was a familiar town. Auschwitz 

was a totally different situation, where ev
erything was threatening from Day 1. The 
mi xture of fatherless; the to
tal terror being surrounded by el
ectrical barbed wire; by a 
system in place - you know, I think Starachowic
e camps were run sort of ad hoc, if you 
know what I mean. Run it as well as you can, an
d if you can™t, then shoot a few and kill a 
few and run it. This was organized murder, 
planned, executed and otherwise set up to the 
last detail. And then you get thrown into a si
tuation of different nationalities, so you are 
beginning to understand the scope of
 this entire drama - it™s no
t a drama - of this entire 
epic is much larger . It  isn™ t a little St ar achow
ice slave labor camp that
 is kept to produce 
war machinery, where just soldiers fi ght each 
other. This is anothe
r aspect of some thing 
that is not yet even known or compr e hended 
or - it doesn™t seem to serve a purpose. You 
see, in Starachowice, you could always ra
tionalize: ﬁThey have to keep these slave 
laborers; otherwise, they cannot
 win the war. If they don™t 
produce the cannon shells, the 
war cannot be won, or whatever. They cannot
 fi ght the war.ﬂ So, 
however you slice it, 
these people are not expendable because 
somebody has to produce war material. In 
Auschwitz, there™s no such reasoning availa
ble to you because you re
alize this place is 
like a dead end. It has no func
tion as far as doing some thing for any reasonable kind of an 
end. It doesn™t produce war ma terial. It doesn
™t do anything to fight the Ge rmans– er– 
to help the Germans to fight the war. It 
houses people who are getting killed. Nobody is 
doing anything except stupid things - if a
nything, cutting ma rshes and, like Sisyphus, 
carrying back and forth the rocks from here
 to there. We  saw our Aunt Rose from 
Radom. One  day we are on the line carrying 
the rocks here and sh
e was going with the 
rocks there and we waved to her. We  didn™
t know she was in Auschwitz. So, you begin to 
understand, even as I was beginning now to more 
or less ma ture into this reality of what 
it was, that this is anot her story all together. 
This is absolutely the end of the line for not 
just Starachowice people and the Jews. It™s
 the mi xture people - you get Czech people 
and they brought in the transport from Salern
jica Grise (ph) and all kinds of people who, 
for all kinds of reasons who have nothing 
to do with punishme nt. So, that™s when it 
become s obvious that that is another thi
ng to cont emplate. So, basically, a place like 

Auschwitz, where you do not produce, cannot be 
explained away. It must be confronted, 
even for some body as -  some body who tries so 
hard to dismiss certain things, meaning, 
ﬁ Well, you know, tomorrow is another day, and th
is isn™t so bad.ﬂ But it is. It is. Now you 
know it is so bad. And, you know, we still don
™t know that Father perished, we don™t 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
61 
 
know that yet. But the ambiance, and the work
 that is not work, and the food that isn™t 
food, and the constant roll calls, and the th
reats if you don™t show
 on roll call everybody 
else gets killed and all this, this has a
nother dime nsion. And this is when, I me an, you 
see, I have already learned to live
 with fear as part of - fear 
that could at l
east be used to 
motivate me  to look out and to watch out, to see that I don™t become  a burden to my 
sisters and to see that I can ma neuve r some how t hrough. But here, there is just some how 

- things are cut off when we
 come to Auschwitz because 
you don™t see anything to justify 
your being there. ﬁWhy do they want me  here
?  Over there, they needed the laundry, but 
here they don™t need anything. They™re just
 feeding you for nothing.ﬂ Wh ich is another 
thing that I understood by then
: you cannot be fe d for nothing - whatever feeding that 
meant - but if you are fed, that means they 
permit you to live, and if they permit you to 
live, that means they have to use you for 
whatever you that have. But here, there is 
nothing to do. I mean, it has no connection to al
l the things that you 
have already figured 
out, that I have already figured out. So, I realiz
ed then that  this would really be the end 
for us. But I still didn™t think that I would have 
to decide how to get ou
t of it. I felt Krysia 
and Hania would really protect me . So, whatev
er happens, with three of us together. But 
that was a dark hour; those were really da
rk hours in Auschwitz, the first period, you 
know. Of course, it was getting colder, and after the quarant
ine we were sent to cut 
ma rshes and it was getting much colder. We
 wer e  standing in water. And it was 
physically getting to be - not that it wa s de
meaning. Nothing was demeaning anymore. It 
was just the physical hardship
 was beginning to creep in. 
 
Q: What were you wearing on your feet?  
 
A: I think we we re wearing w
ooden shoes, and that was bad. 
 
Q: So, you were probably blistering up again. 
 
A: Yes, and you know, working in the ma rshes, 
we  were in wetness always. And this is by 
now probably October. You know, it gets chil
ly in Poland. October is a very chilly 
month. 
 
Q: Did you know about the uprisi
ng and the blowing up of the gas chambers in October?  
 
A: Yes, the word got around. I didn™t know all 
the details, but I knew 
there was an uprising, 
yes. Because, you see, we were now mi xed in
 with all the other - the people who were 
longer and longest and we were the shorter a
nd there were others the shortest. You know, 
so this was already - we arri
ved in, let™s say, August, early August, and this is October, 
and meanwhile others came  a fter us, but 
there were now other people who came two 
years before us. So, we were getting pr
etty - and nine pe
ople on the - you know, you 
could talk to your heart™s content, because 
outside they wouldn™t allow it ma ybe, but in 
the privacy of your nine people™s 
perch, you can exchange infor mation. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
62 
 
Q: How did you notice the way peopl
e were relating to each other?  I mean, this is a situation 
of enor mous deprivation, let alone terror 
and fear. When you think 
about the barrack, did 
you see people fighting with each other, or
 screaming at each other, or stealing?  
 
A: Yes, definitely, yes, but I 
didn™t experience any of it. I don™t
 know, I really always talk 
about it, that huma n kindness is what I ha
ve actually depended on. That I have - 
Some how, people have always shown me  a cer
tain kind of deference - not deference 
because of anything that I represent, in 
fact, because I was skinny and undernourished 
and a poor little skinny kid. So, everybody was 
taking pity on me , you know, so I always 
felt no ma tter where I went, there was always somebody taking pity on me  to do this or to 
do that or to console me  or whatever. We  ne
ver had situations where we had to fight, but 
there were people in the barra
cks absolutely who fought. I me an, people would kill for a 
piece of bread. And people would– But, you know, I always have this habit in me  to 

analyze things, why would– ﬁWell, ma ybe 
the Greek people, they understand things 
differently.ﬂ I was yet to grow up to unders
tand that people are just people. You can 
come  from the North Pole or the South Pole 
or anywhere in betwee
n. It ™s still the same 
people and it™s exactly– The 
only thing is that in such 
unusual circumstances, different 
people reveal their character in a different
 way, so that some  people who personify 
goodness become  even better than goodness pers
onified. Others who have the beast in 
them become even more beastly. You could 
see that among the Germans as well - those 

who turned a tender head when they could see so me thing wasn™t exactly according to the 

rule, and those who just waited for you to step
 out of the line- up two inches because  they 

were ready to kill, and they were ready, and 
you stepped out and that was it. But those are 
all musings on a psychological ki nd of a reality that, in my own little worl d in those da ys 
- I could alwa ys depend on the Starachowice pe
ople who were still around, that I knew. 
And we were still around, mi xed with them. An
d then there were others who were also 
riddled with fear. And then ther
e were others that I always fe
lt that I didn™t want to be 
near - I mean, prisoners, you know?  This was 
a world of its own, but
 a reflection of a 
bigger world, I guess, which is that huma n beings
 just are about the same everywhere, it™s 
the circumstances that bring out in you 
whatever it is that you have in you. 
 
Q: Did anyone ever surprise you, some one you th
ought was a good person turned out in that 
situation to be very difficult or harsh?  
 
A: I can™t reme mber those things really. I™m 
sure if I thought about it, I probably would dig 
it out some where in the recesses of my mi nd. But at this point, no, I couldn™t off-hand 
think of anybody, but I do know that, speaking in 
generalities, I could te
ll you that people 
always took pity on me  and were nice to me
. That, I mean, I don™t know how else to put 
that. There was some thing about people that ma de them look after me . 
 
Q: So you never found a circumstance where peopl
e actually resented th
e fact that you were 
so young and still survived?  Wo me n who mi
ght have been older and had lost–?  
 
A: No, quite the opposite. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
63 
 
 
Q: Really? 
 
A: Quite the opposite. Maybe I remi nded them of
 their ki d. Whatever it was, but it was quite 
the opposite. And I always said to myself it™s
 because I look like that. And I never fought 
my way to be first in line or first to get f
ood. I always got sort of behind, I think. That™s 
very strange when I think about it, but that™s 
how it was. I did survive thanks to Chris and 
Hania, but I also survived thanks to th
e goodness of other people. There™s no question 
about it. That absolutely is a fact. 
 
Q: Did you ever get depressed during th
ese first few months in Auschwitz? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Youdidn™t? 
 
A: No, and I™ll tell you why. I was so preoccupied 
with survival. First of 
all, I was filled with 
fear. And out of the fear 
came the fact that I™ve got to ma nage. And you cannot let 
yourself - not that you can™t - I 
didn™t - I couldn™t - I just 
- whatever it was, whether I 
wouldn™t allow myself or whether I knew that
 it wouldn™t lead a
nywhere. The fact was 
you had to face what it was and ma nage. And that was what took up - you can™t be  
depressed. Because depressed means tomorrow they put a bullet through your head. 
 
Q: Did you see ma ny depressed people? 
 
A: Oh, yes. I had already analyzed this before
. I think older people ha
d a harder time  than 
younger kids. And I noticed this after the wa
r, too, when we came to America. People 
who already lived a life, you know?  People 
who had lived, who were ma rried or 
whatever. They were forever probably, I don™t 
know, grieving for what - I mean, I didn™t 
have time to grieve because I didn™t live yet. 
I didn™t live yet, and all I knew was I had to 

watch out. That was just to sum it up in a ve
ry plain way. I had to watch out. And other 
than that, depressed - I don™t 
that that was even a concept 
that I could really even know 
what it was about. I just knew that had to
 stay on the ma rk, you know?  Not to allow 

myself to do what is not supposed to be done, 
and not to allow myself
 to be called into a 
place that I knew would be trouble. And that
 was it. And that was - you know, I think 
when prisoners are in prison who break out 
of a prison, I think th
at™s how they spend 
their days, thinking forever how to break 
out. I had no idea how to break out, and I 
certainly wouldn™t attempt it. But the idea of
 how to stay on the ma rk, it was a total 
preoccupation, which, of course, included how to
 survive on the meager food. It wasn™t 
just the fear that could get 
you; it was the lack of food. And 
don™t forget, I was a growing 
child and did not get proper nutrition. Other 
people required were hungrier than I because 
my body didn™t require much, or ma ybe I was stupi
d to think that, but I really did not - I 
wasn™t driven to insanity by hunger, because 
I was very hungry but my body tolerated it. 
So, you see, this idea of depression, I don™t know that I knew the me aning of it, because 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
64 
 
life was too busy surviving. And in any way 
of pushing my way or whatever; just 
mi nding my person. And that™s about all I 
can tell you about de pressi on. I will tell you 
100% it was a totally foreign concept to me , if I even knew what it meant - I probably 
didn™t. 
 
Q: Do you have vivid recollections of the food?  
 
A: Yes. I™ll tell you what, I used to use– 
I™ll tell you now, because Victor , my husband 
Victor, loved turnips. When we got ma rri
ed, he said, ﬁOh, I™d love for you to cook 
turnips.ﬂ And I said, ﬁOne thing I™m going 
to tell you right now,ﬂ because you know he™s 
American-born, three generations. And I sa
id, ﬁOne thing - I™d cook anything and 
everything. Please don™t ask me  to cook turnip
s.ﬂ And he said, ﬁ Why not?  It™s a very 
good food.ﬂ And I said, ﬁListen, I have an associ
ation with the smell of
 turnips and I will 
never get over it, not ever. Please don™t ask me
 to cook it. I will not 
cook it. If you want 
turnips, you will have to go to a rest aurant.ﬂ
 Because, in Auschwitz, the only thing you 
ever got was turnips in a soup. The turnips, 
of course, were never washed, so you had the 
sand and the peel, and the turnip. If you found 
a piece of turnip, it was lucky. But the - I 

can™t say fragrance. That™s too fancy. But the 
smell of the turnip is
 so deeply ingrained 
with me  with that period, th
at I truly cannot stand - not th
e sight of turnip, I wouldn™t 
know, because it looks like a sweet potato. If
 you cook it pr operly and away from me, 
maybe I wouldn™t know until I tasted it. But ab
solutely that is what remained - the 
business with the turnips. That was food. I th
ink they gave out coffee once - Coffee with 
a capital ‚C™ - that was the water with a littl
e chicory in it, I guess, and a piece of bread 
and the turnip soup. That was food. 
 
Q: Did you ever have ma rgarine on your food, or–?  
 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t reme mber. I just know
 that there were other people who were 
always hungrier than I was. I was very, ve
ry hungry, but I was not as hungry - I think 
Hania was always hungrier than I was. She was 
always tall, very tall, I me an, as Polish 
wome n go, I mean, as people from Poland go, ev
en Jewish, she was very tall, and I wa s 
just a skinny kid, but Hania 
was tall and I think her body requ
ired more food than mi ne. 
 
Q: So, you think she suffered more than you?  
 
A: I think so, and I knew people who really, tr
uly suffered from hunger mor e  than I. I used 
to dream about food. You see, you asked me
 whether I had nightmares. No. You know 
what I dreamt about?  I dreamt about the table 
settings my mother used to put out. My 
mother used to love to serve elegantly. I l
ove to reme mber that. And I reme mber this 
party and I reme mber the settings. I reme mber
 the food that was on it,
 but the settings, I 
was obsessed with the settings, in my  dreams, 
in my recollections of home. So, that wa s 

really, that was part of getting fed.

Q: So, I™m going to take you back, just  because you me ntioned this, talk about being 
stimulated to go back for a mo ment to another 
time . Chris, when she 
talked about the first 
night that you came back after you had left
 town when the war started, and you came 
back. The first meal back home, she claims th
at your father said, ﬁWe are going to set the 
table with a tablecloth and a for mal sett
ing,ﬂ even though you had very little food. You 
d o  r e me mb e r  t h at?  
 
A: Yes,absolutely. 
 
Q: It™s quite extraordinary. 
 
A: Yes, as a ma tter of fact, as time went on, a
nd we would always have proper settings and 
there was not much to eat - a boiled potato - b
ecause that kept a semblance of a life. But, 
of course, in Auschwitz you could dream about 
it. I mean, M other used to set beautiful 
tables - I don™t mean during the war. Bu
t you know, I even dreamt about sugar cookies, 
those sweet– sweet– beet– 
 
Q: Sugarbeet? 
 
A: Yes, sugar beet cookies, because when she 
learned to bake that during the war, I even 
dreamt about that, and that™s quite a leap
 from looking at an elegant table. 
 
Q: Do you remember people having conversations about food?  
 
A: Oh, all the time, all the time, all th
e time  people used to talk about food. 
 
Q: And what kind of a conversation wa
s it?  Did people exchange recipes?  
 
A: Yes, they talked about recipes. They talk
ed about what they saw in display windows. If 
they happened to be from the same  town, ﬁO
h, you reme mbe r , this pastry that had this 
display of every day fresh–ﬂ What ever. Absolutely, all the time . 
 
Q: Now, how did that function for people?  I do 
know one survivor felt li
ke ﬁwe ate with our 
talkﬂ, or  some thing. It was as if the talk was a substitute. 
 
A: Itwas. 
 
Q: But it didn™t hurt more or ma ke you more hungry?  
 
A: No, I™ll give you an analogy. When I cook, you know, I like to cook, I used to cook 
fancier because now we™re eating all this other 
simpler stuff. But in the da ys when I was 
cooking, and I would have a part
y, whatever, I would have no time to eat, and I was so 
hungry, hungry, but I had to cook, so I said, ﬁWell,
 let me  first start cooking.ﬂ And by the 
time I was done cooking all these French dishes 
with the wine and all, I was so satiated 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
66 
 
from the fragrance, this beautiful fragrance 
of the food, that by the time  I was done with 
cooking, I really didn™t need to 
eat. I definitely didn™t need 
to eat because the idea plus 
the fragrance, the wonderful wine cooking, woul
d fill me. That is analogous to the fact 
that, if you, perhaps, if you ta
lked of food that was really 
part of another setting, and I 
don™t mean food just for the eating of it, but 
for the sustenance and 
the other thing that 
come s with food, that that could fill you. Not 
for long, because eventually, five, six hours 
later you still would wake up hungry and fa mi sh
ed, but that is the only analogy that I 
could think of. And it is true. It is absolutely 
true because people were talking all the time  
about food. 
 
Q: And you, too?  
 
A: Yes, yes. You know, people were descri
bing this or these people talking about 
ptishye
 
(ph), which were like 
profiteroles au chocolat
, so you reme mber, and then it filled you. 
So, I guess there has to be some thi
ng to it if so ma ny people did it. 
 
Q: Did you see a lot peop
le smoking, wome n s moking?  
 
A: No, I don™t think there were any cigarettes. 
I remember that during the war they used to 
roll in a piece of pape
r and I don™t even think they had t
obacco; I think they had crushed 
leaves or some thing. My father was a 
smoker, though, but not my mother. Wo men, I 
don™t reme mber that wo me n s moke. Or ma ybe they did, but certainly not in camp. 
 
Q: No, that™s what I meant: did you ever see 
wome n using cigarettes to barter for other 
things? 
 
A: Oh, to barter, yes, not to smoke. 
 
Q: Oh, to barter?  
 
A: To barter, absolutely. Le t™s say you wanted 
a piece of bread. So, you sold a scarf to get a 
turnip, then you exchange the turnip for cigare
ttes, and then you barter the cigarettes for 
bread. You see how that went?  You were a 
non-smoker. The cigarette was a means of 
getting the bread in a circuitous way. 
 
Q: So, cigarettes were very valuable?  
 
A: Very, but the final object wa
s bread. How you arrived at it is 
another story, but cigarettes 
were very often involved. It wasn™t because you smoked them for yourself or smoke– 

Who eventually ended up with the cigarettes, I have no idea. 
 
Q: Did you ever barter?  
 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
67 
 
 
Q: But your sisters must have. 
 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t know, I really
 don™t know. This is out of my hand. 
 
Q: I think we™ll break for the tape at this 
point, because I have a 
longer question to ask. 
 
End of Tape #8

Tape #9
 
 
Q: I want to go back again to Majowka becau
se I neglected to ask some thing, and it ma y 
make a connection to Auschwitz, I don™t 
know. Was there sexual abuse of wome n in 
Majowka that you know about?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In none of the camps?  
 
A: I really, I don™t know. 
If there was, I am not
 aware of it at all. 
 
Q: So, you were not afraid of any kind of sexual–? 
 
A: No, how could I be, considering who I 
was and how I looked and who, I guess, would 
look at me ?  That was never, ever– Later on, 
when we were past Retzow and after the 
Liberation, that™s a story furt
her on, when we we re inside of Germany and the Russians 
came, and we were warned that they rape 
wome n, so we should run away and we should 
not stay there. That™s as far,
 but, but even by then, I didn™t ev
er think of it. The only thing 
that I was afraid of in - unless other wome n 
experienced it in Auschwitz - that if you were 
sick and had to stay behind on the bunk, and 
you couldn™t go to the outside, to work, like 
in the ma rshes like we did, that they woul
d come  and drag you out and they would do 
with you what they wanted to do with you, what
ever that meant, but I guess that me ant 
probably more of being killed than– Yes, but
 you see after the Auschw
itz detail left, and 
barrack had to be emptied, they went thr
ough the barracks to see 
if anyone was hiding 
because sick people who couldn™t ma ke it to
 the roll call– So if they found you, they 
took you whenever they took you, but that was 
never, ever an issue, not with me . 
 
Q: Do you remember the day when Chris was take
n out of the barrack and told to take her 
two sisters, when you are given this, what
 ends up being a very protected job?  
 
A: You mean in Auschwitz?  Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes. 
 
Q: Can you describe that day?  
 
A: Well, in fact, some body just remi nded me  th
at Chris and Hania actually were asked for 
the jobs and I wasn™t. I was goi
ng to be left behind. No, th
is was an opening in - ma ybe 
I™ll sort of put a frame around it - We  are now 
in Auschwitz since, let™s say, early August. 
We have been in quarantine and we have wo
rked in the ma rshes and it™s getting very 
much colder, very much, because winter is settin
g in. There is a detail of women that is to 
be sent to a place where they sort clot hes th
at is left behind by political prisoners, not 
Jews, not Jews. We  don™t yet know why or how, 
but they request, I think, thirty wome n 
or whatever to be sent there.
 So Krysia and Hania are picked for the detail, and I am not 
to be in the detail because I am s mall. 
So, some body intervened on my be half and she 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
69 
 
said, ﬁShe is a hard worker and she™s very 
smart. She would be very good.ﬂ So, instead of 
thirty, they let go thirty-one. And we arri
ved– The first week, we went to work and 
came back to the barrack, or maybe the firs
t two weeks. I don™t reme mber . But in the 
beginning, we went there and then came back. 
What we found out is that the wome n at 
that job, that™s still Auschwitz 
property, except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the 
wome n, political prisoners, were some how involve d in the Polish underground or they 

were in cahoots or whatever, so they were
 shipped out. So, now, they didn™t want any 
more Polish women Christians; they wanted 
the safer type, which is from the Jewish 
camp. So, a gain, as I said, I don™
t know if it was a week or 
two weeks or three weeks - 
whatever it was, originally we went there a
nd back, there and back at night. Eventually, 
we didn™t go back to the barra
cks in Birkenau; we stayed th
ere. And that was a Heaven 
sent. First of all, if got cold
 outside. We didn™t have to go to
 the ma rshes. Second of all, 
we were dressed now properly;  you see, because 
we were next to those piles of clot he s, 
so we could pick what we 
had, what we could wear. And now it was getting colder, so 
shoes were very important - very. So, we 
had warmer clothing, better shoes, and we 
worked at that detail, and these women were 
a very interesting group. 
They were all very 
intelligent, and they had real 
political connections. Some  of 
them - we discovered one of 
them, Christina Jevulsha (ph), that she was 
Jewish actually, but she was a Polish political 
prisoner, passing for a Christian. Anyhow, we wo
rked at that detail up to the evacuation 
of Auschwitz, the death ma rch, and that really
 saved our life because we were already 
getting terribly run down from the outdoor work
 in the ma rshes, you see, and now it was 
getting worse because the winter was comi ng. 
And because we worked in that pl ace - 
probably two months or so - and we slept 
indoors and we worked indoors, and we were 
wearing better clothes. So when the death 
ma rch, the evacuation of Auschwitz took place, 
we walked out on the death ma rch wearing 
proper clothes, meaning warm clothes for 
winter, and our health was restored because 
we didn™t work outdoors, and I think the food 

was a little better, too, although I do not reme
mber exactly what the feeding was, how 
they - it was institutional food, and it was doled 
out, but it probably was a little more than 
the turnip soup with th
e sand in it. And that - you know, it 
seems, in that whole saga of 
this war experience, it seems that there were 
al ready a little - there 
was a little interval 
that allowed us a little breathing space whic
h restored the soul and the body before we 
would face the other horror. So, luckily, that st retch of time - which wasn™t more than 

probably two months - allowed us
 to really, by not working ou
tdoors, not to really come  
down with whatever, you see. 
 
Q: Did it surprise you that, in the c
ontext of Auschwitz
, there would be 
kommandos
 that 
would not have selections, that
 you really were not only prot
ected from t he elements, but 
protected from what
 Auschwitz was?  
 
A: Yes, very much. But, you see, this was such an exceptional setting which was totally 
strange to us. The clothes of political pr
isoners were hung up, numbered. If a political 
prisoner died, the stuff had been packed and se
nt to the family. If 
a political prisoner was 
transferred, the clothes traveled
 afterthem. We  were engage
d in packing. And of course, 
Heaven help you if you stole some thing or took 
a thread out of it. And the fact rema ins 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
70 
 
that I couldn™t imagine that a thing like th
at existed. Send the clot
hes of that prisoner 
back to the family?  I still don™t understand it in
 the scheme  of the ge
nocide, of the Nazi 
genocide, why that was done. I mean, these 
were Christian, obviously, but what was the 
importance of sending the clothes back to the families? After all the harassment and the 
inhumanity that they have shown the huma n be
ings, that they should be concerned about 

clothes being– I just, it doesn™t
, I don™t know. But luckily for 
us, that was the case. And 
so I learned to pack. But that was, it wa
s good because we were in a more civilized 
setting, to begin with. These Polish wome n we
r e  very good. They we
re very intelligent 
and there was very little of that animosit
y, the Polish-Jewish type
, no, this was rather– 
 
Q: These were also old-timers who remain
ed there. They had been there awhile. 
 
A: Yes. I think most of them were shipped out. 
I think thirty or thirty
-one were shipped out. 
 
Q: But there was a group that was still there?  
 
A: Yes, some body had to be left behind to 
show the newcomers. But I do know that they 
were in touch with other Polish prisoners, but
, of course, we never 
were aware of really, 
of what was going on. But I do know now th
at they had contact with the Polish 
underground. 
 
Q: Do you have any idea how come  Hania and Ch
ris were chosen out 
of all the wome n in 
the barrack? 
 
A: Yes, the woma n who did help us wrote a 
book about it. She liked us, so writes in the 
book that we  were not the pugnacious type, a
nd she noticed that other people knew how 
to fight their way out and way in. 
 
Q: Who is she? 
 
A: Felicia Hyatt, Felicia Berlant Hyatt (ph). Sh
e was a scribe in the barrack, and she took a 
liking to us. And she, when the request came 
for people, she picked us, and she was the 
one who was instrume ntal in my being attached
 to this detail. And she wrote not a very 

nice chapter, it™s in
 her book, it™s called 
Short Calls
–something 
Calls
, what is it–
Close 
Calls
. And so she was instrume ntal in that sh
e took a liking to us, she said they were 
intelligent girls and we di dn™t know how to fight
 our way out so, whatever. She says that 
in the book. So, anyhow, that™s how we ended 
up there, and that was a lifesaver.  
 
Q: So, then there™s going to be
 an evacuation of Auschwitz. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you have - I don™t know how to 
use the word - to stay, or to go?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
71 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nochoice. 
 
A: No, the only choice we were
 given to others who did st
ays, was like my friend Hannah 
Tenser from Israel, who was left in the gas ch
ambers because they ran out of gas, or other 
people who were too sick to move; they were left  behind as refuse. But we were just 
ma rched out like everybody else. But we were lucky that we were dressed well because it 

was January and it was cold. So, I don™t know that we would have ma de it. Maybe we 

would have - other people did. But it helped 
to have good shoes and to have good clothes. 
 
Q: Did you have gloves?  
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: Hat?  
 
A: Yes. We  had access to the piles of clothi
ng that they wanted... You know, when we got 
there, they said take off everything you have
 on and go pick some thi
ng that fits you - not 
from the prisoners but from the Jewish property. 
So, we had shoes to f
it and clothes to fit 
and it was wa rm, because we were there toward, you know, in the winter. 
 
Q: Yes, it was January 18th. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you leave Birkenau and walk toward Au
schwitz I, or do you 
have any recollection 
where you went?  
 
A: No, I only know that we went on a ma rch, and I only know that I completely lost my 
mi nd. And I fell asleep while walking. I was 
sleepwalking. I absolutely fell asleep, and 
Chris and Hania were dragging me . And the w
hole ma rch is one - it™s not a nightmare, 
it™s completely obliterated except for what 
I remember: the snow was on the ground, we 
were ma rching down a country road or whatev
er, with dark trees on each side and snow 
in the mi ddle, and it seemed like a place - an 
enclosure. So, I was walking and they were 
dragging me , but I was dead asleep, totally. A
nd I always talk about it, when, every now 
and then, they would stop everybody to relieve  hims elf, and Chris and Hania would squat 

down and tell me  to relieve myself, but I w
ouldn™t because  I wasn™t here; I was in the 
other reality, so that - it
™s true, and so finally– 
 
Q: Were you actually sleeping?  
 
A: Yes.Yes. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
72 
 
Q: This is an 18-mile walk–  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: –to Gleiwitz . And you were sleeping?  
 
A: It was to Gleiwitz? I didn™t know. That™s 
where we went, right, 
I didn™t know. Gliwice 
now, right. And I didn™t know where we were 
walking, and I have no recollection except 
for this enclosure, white snow and the trees.  
 
Q: On the one hand, you say that you we re dresse
d well, and you clearl
y felt better than you 
had two mo nths prior, right?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So, what™s this sleeping about?  
 
A: I have no idea. I walked as much as I coul
d and the rest I slept. I know one thing which I 
am very proud of. When we got to a certain bi
g barn with where to stay overnight, and I 
must have been terribly clumsy or horribl
y tired, and I wasn™t moving right, and a 
German ca me  and knoc ked me  in my face - this
 is the second time, by the way. I once got 
hit in Auschwitz like this - with a ring; 
he was wearing a big si
gnet ring, and he knocked 
me , and I fel l  right down at the barn door, a
nd everybody else was chas
ed into the barn. I 
had the presence of mi nd when I woke up, 
when they started blowing whistles for 
everybody to get up, I had the presence of mi nd to stand by the door, and found Krysia 
and Hania as they came out. But that was–One 
day I have to have th
is ma de to–I have 
to account for it, how it came about that I slep
t through this ma rch. At 
least half the way I 
slept through. 
 
Q: And also how to account for your two sister
s having the strength to hold you for that 
long. 
 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know. They were pus
hing me , you know. They were pushing me  
and talking to me  and I kept 
sleeping, and I truly don™t know. 
 
Q: So, you think that you we re sleepwalking. 
 
A: Not sleepwalking, I was just sleeping. I 
do reme mber that I never thought of the place 
where I was as I was as the place I was in. 
 
Q: Oh. 
 
A: I thought that was some where - because, the 
dark skies - we walked at night - and the 
dark trees and the white bottom. So, I™m now 
in an enclosure. I™m not outdoors. You see, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
73 
 
I am not outdoors. I am some where in an en
closure, walking down. But how that jives 
with the reality, that 
I™ve never figured out, but that was a fact.  
 
Q: Did they try to wake you?  
 
A: No, they just dragged me . I mean, there was no reason, I mean, to wake me , so if I 
opened my e yes - I probably had my eyes open, but I was sleeping. I was really very 
much asleep. Much of the trip, I was as
leep, until we reached
 Gleiwitz, was it? 
 
Q: And then you were on– 
 
A: –on the train, yeah, they were in open cars,
 and the snow was falling, that I reme mber 
Yeah, because by the time  we reached Ravens
brück, I was awake, having slept myself 
out on the train. You know, we sat in open cars,
 so the snow was falling, and we ate the 
snow off our  coats, so that between the fr
esh air and not having to walk and the snow, 
which was moisture, I came  to. And  when we
 got to Ravensbrück, I knew, finally I saw 
the sign ﬁRavensbrückﬂ. I did read it; I did 
see the sign. So I knew we were in another 
place, not that place that was an enclosure. 
 
Q: [laughs] That™s very interesting. 
Did you think you were going to die?  
 
A: Um, ma ny times, but not at this particular - 
I mean, by then I reali
zed everything sort of 
was a chance, you know?  Chancy, things were 
chancy, things were too chancy and all 
around. So, if I was going to die, that meansthat™s what came up. Because there was no 
planning, you know, there was no planning, ther
e was no decision ma king on that score. 
It™s just how the wind carried you. If you were
 too exhausted and your legs were swollen 
and you fell by the wayside, that was the e
nd. But it wasn™t that you planned what I™m 
going to do ten days later, nothing. You just went
 with the event, went with the flow, as 
they say. 
 
Q: So, none of you - neither of you - got sick in Auschwitz?  
 
A: Krysia was sick, yes, Chris was sick one 
time. I forget what wa s her–her legs?  No, I 
forgot. She was sick, and then she got better
. You™d have to ask her, but I do reme mb er 
she was sick, yes. But, you see, on the death ma rch, I wasn™t sick. I was just over-
exhausted or whatever. And you see, I always 
talk about the fact that I was skinny, and I 
wasn™t hungry, but ma ybe my body was grow
ing and required more - maybe it didn™t 
require food but it required rest
. I don™t know. It™s a mystery. 
 
Q: When you arrived in Ravensbrück, some
body made a decision - I don™t know if it was 
Hania or Chris - undoubtedly it wasn™t you– 
 
A: No. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Q: –because you claim you never ma de any deci
sions - to say that you were Christian, and 
to take the name Gorska as the last name. 
 
A: And I don™t reme mber that. 
 
Q: You don™t reme mber that?  
 
A: No, but I do know - I know that it ha
ppened, but I don™t know how it came about or 
where or whatever. 
 
Q: But you do reme mber that that™s how you were known?  
 
A: Yes, because Ravensbrüc k, as you know - this
 is about the end of January or so, early 
February - and Ravensbrück was so overrun with
 people. All these camps that were first 
evacuated from Poland into Germany, and then from Ger many and Poland into - they 
were just shoving them in. They put up tent
s in Ravensbrück; there were no more 
barracks available. There were tents. So that
 it really, you were so, now - now we were 
completely disconnected from the original grou
p. We  were still traveled - when we were 
in Auschwitz we were very much wi th th
e group - but because we were not evacuated 
with the Starachowice people, we came  there with another group, and then we got mi xed 

in with all kinds of nationa
lities and people camps that you 
never heard of and that you 
did hear of and so on. So, it didn™t ma tter 
who you were. You could have told them you 
were Roosevelt™s daughter, you know, for that ma tter. You could have picked out 

some thing out of the blue moon, or King Far
ouk™s first wife, whatever, you see?  So, if 
Hania said that or Krysia said
 that, it must be so. But, as
 I told you, it wasn™t my decision. 
 
Q: How horrible was it in Ravensbrück? 
 
A: Very bad - it was the worst. 
 
Q: Worse than Auschwitz?  Why?   
 
A: Because it was disorganized. Not that it wa
s di sorg-–It wasn™t in any way planned to 
contain the number of people that were ship
ped in. It was in no 
way organized with a 
plan for the future, even, because the war 
was now turning, you know, the war effort of 
the Allies wa s now taking shape. So, that 
the Germans, whatever they were up to, knew 
only themselves, but the fact is that a pl
ace like Ra vensbrück that had all these people 
shipped in - and ma ybe the decision wasn™t ye
t made what to do with that, with these 
people, I don™t know - but the 
fact rema ins that the camp wa s overrun. We stayed in a 
tent. There were no mor e  people possible to 
squeeze into the barracks. You can imagine 
they accommodated you now in the Grand Hotel now, in the tent, because, I me an, this 

was beyond any setting, especially since they 
always were so organized in the - their 
genocidal plan included every 
detail on down the line, and th
is was, of course, already 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
75 
 
out of their hands. So, that was rough; th
at was ba d. The food was - no food and no place 
to stay in, and just chaos. 
 
Q: All right, you haven™
t taken - been able to clean yourself for days– 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So– 
 
A: I don™t reme mber. I think we used snow, or 
something like this. That could very well be. 
Because we ate snow, and we probabl
y cleaned ourselves with snow, too. 
 
Q: And did the registration in
clude giving you a new number?  
 
A: I don™t think so. 
 
Q: So, you kept the same  number?  
 
A: Frankly, I don™t even think they register
ed us. I mean, if you consider what was 
happening at the time, with the influx of th
e people. I really don™t reme mber, I truly, I 
don™t, but it was so chaotic that I can™t imagine 
that they would still 
be able to count or 
whatever. 
 
Q: Did you have a red stripe down your back fr
om Auschwitz? A painte
d red stripe?  Or did 
you have clothes that didn™t have that?  
 
A: Uh, no, not from Auschwitz. Later on I had 
the ﬁXﬂ, white ﬁXﬂ on my c oat, up front and 
in the back.  
 
Q: FromRetzow?  
 
A: I think it was from Retzow, yes. It was a wh
ite enamel ﬁXﬂ, big ﬁXﬂ, right down from the 
shoulder down on both sides. But my recoll
ection of Ravensbrüc
k - I don™t know how 
long we were there. Ten days?  A week
?  Not long. But it was total chaos. 
 
Q: Were people dying?  
 
A: Yes, in fact, we have a friend from Is rael
 whose mother we saw in the melee of people. 
We saw out of nowhere. Mrs. Linsburg, we ra
n into Mrs. Linsburg. And years later, we 
told the daughter who survive
d, who lives in Israel. She lo
st her mother somewhere in 
Ravensbrück and she never found out what happe
ned to her - No, her 
mot her disappeared 
and she never know where. And we told he
r, we saw her in Ra vensbrück. We just 
glanced at he r in Ravensbrück, because she was in Ravensbrüc k. But what happened 
after, we don™t know. But I™m
 telling you, it was total chao
s, so that it was just 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
76 
 
impossible. And people who were with each othe
r, if they were separated, then that was 
the end of that. 
 
Q: By this time , by the time  you™re in Ra
vensbrück, have you found out what happened to 
your - that your father is dead 
- or you still don™
t know anything?  
 
A: No, no, we didn™t know yet. 
 
Q: You didn™t know?  
 
A: No, because we had to find out from the 
men, you see. It™s the men from Starachowice 
who knew what happened. I don™t know at wh
ich point we found out about it. I don™t 
know, but we did have to 
find it out from the men. 
 
Q: So, that™s later, then? 
 
A: Probably, I don™t know. Or ma ybe we alrea
dy knew. I couldn™t te
ll you for sure. But I 
know that we did find out that he pe
rished in October, October of ™44. 
 
Q: And by the time  you™re in Ravensbrück, have
 you decided that your mother is already 
dead? 
 
A: In all likelihood, we™ve thought that in all 
likelihood that she would not turn up because 
we™d seen too much and heard too much. We
 heard too much. You see, having now been 
mi xed in with all the people from Auschw
itz and in Ravensbrück, with the influx of 
people from every conceivable part of Poland, 
it wa s very easy to pi
ece things together. 
So that–we had a pretty good idea I think by th
en, but not a certainty, and certainly did 
not give up the idea that th
ey mi ght still be alive. 
 
Q: Do you remember the mome nt when so
me one as ked for volunteers to get out of 
Ravensbrück and go to a subcamp? 
 
A: Yes, yes, I reme mber that, yeah. And, not I,
 but Krysia and Hania,
 Chris and Hania, we 
all volunteered, and– As I™m fond of saying, 
we volunteered for what?  We  didn™t know. 
It could have been going up the chimney, but 
we volunteered to get 
out of Auschwitz, not 
to go wherever - we didn™t know– 
 
Q: YoumeanRavensbrück? 
 
A: Out of Rave nsbrück, right. We  volunteered because things have gotten to be totally 
impossible, totally. So, they said, whoever 
wants to go, get on the truck, but where the 
truck was going nobody knew. But that was a ve
ry fine choice, because these were the 
first shipme nts out of Ravensbrück, and we
 ended up in Retzow, which was an empt y 
camp, which was later to be receiving other pr
isoners, but we were lucky enough to staff 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
77 
 
that camp. I ended up a ma id for an SS woma
n. Hania ended up a ma id for the - in an 
office. Chris didn™t have a good 
job - I forgot, Chris told me , she remi nded me  the other 
day how I spoke on - you know, this I ha
ve to really relate again because– 
 
Q: I think you should hold it because I think we 
have to change the tape before you begin. 
So, we™ll star t with your talking about Chris. 
 
End of Tape #9 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Tape #10
 
 
Q: We ended the last tape with your beginning 
to tell us about the th
ree jobs you had in 
Retzow, and in particular,  Chris, 
you said, had a terrible job first. 
 
A: Yes, I forgot. She actually remi nded me  of 
it, but I reme mbered after she refreshed my 
me mory. I worked for the SS woma n. Our sect
ion, the women™s section of Ravensbrück - 
of Retzow, excuse me  - was ran by SS wome
n, and they were a category of their own, 
awful, brutal people. And they of course n
eeded servants, and I was one of the personal 
servants. She lived in a room. I did her la
undry, I brought in wood to keep the stove 
going, you know, and cleaned the house and so on
. She took a liking to me, but I was still 
a Jew. And she would not come  near me  ever
. I would walk in, she would walk out. And 

if she talked to me, she talked to me from 
another end of the - because she just wouldn™t 
be near me . So, then she started leaving crus
ts of bread for me . She didn™t like crusts. So, 
she said, ﬁI™ll be leaving this 
crust. If you find it on the table,
 that™s for you.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁThank you very much.ﬂ So, meanwhile, one day she came in and she says, ﬁDid you 

find the crusts I left for you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes
, thank you very mu ch. I eat them.ﬂ And she 
says, ﬁHow are things going for you?  W
ho are you here with?  Do you know anybody, do 
you have family? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYes, I have one 
sister who works in the office, she cleans 
the office, and then I have another sister, bu
t she does not have a good job.ﬂ I forgot what 
Krysia did. She says, ﬁAll right, I™ll get he
r a good job.ﬂ So, Krysia was assigned to the 
kitchen, and that was really a great, wonderful
 thing. Of course, she was the most vicious 
thing, but in a very paradoxical
 way, I really benefited greatly
 toward my liberation from 
being her servant, because they were so - 
they lorded over everybody so you not only had 
to do for her and so on. When the evacuation of Retzow was organized, we had to carry 

their rucksacks. They took their stuff, and we
 had to carry - the ma ids had to carry - not 
God forbid some body else. So, when we were
 evacuated from Retzow, as the eastern 

front was approaching, the Russians were a
pproaching closer and 
closer; the war was 
already going toward the end. I think this 
was by then probably April - end of March, 
early April. When we found ourselves on the ro
ad with all the evacuees of every stripe 
and of every possible persuasion, because you ha
d the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish - 
you know, prisoners from the concentrati
on camps, and you had Polish laborers who 
worked on the farm, and you had German military and German out of unifor m, and 

German civilians with dogs and cars and whatev
er - we had to carry their stuff. And then 
when it came to a point where the road was so
 clogged up we couldn™t mo ve, they told us 
to sit down. Well, we ma de a way - there we
re the few maids that were carrying the 
rucksacks - and by the way, I kept saying th
at there were twelve
 of us, but Hania 
remi nded me it was ten, and Helena was one. 
There was one woma n there, Helena, she 
was blonde, one of the servants, or whatever
. She spoke German very well. I think she 
was from Kr akow or some where. When we ma de it off the road, the ma in road where the 

evacuees were, I had this woman™s rucksack with
 all her belongings, so in final analysis, I 
proved to be a skunk, because what Helena 
did - she was carrying some body else™s - and 
you know, they had those black capes, these wo
me n, they had black wool capes that they 
wore. So, Helena put her cape, the cape over 
her clothes and put the 
woman™s hat, and we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
79 
 
all decided... No, I didn™t decide– But the ten 
of us, not the twelve
, the ten of us who 
ma de it off t he road, onto the field and aw
ay from the evacuees on the road, were 
supposed to pretend that we are the prisone
rs and Helena was our guard, and she was 
guiding us - no, not guiding us. Guarding us. 
She was guarding us, you see. So, we had 
the paraphernalia, the German paraphernalia. 
So, she probably, in th
e fi nal analysis, the 
SS woma n, who trusted me , w
ho took a liking, she probably 
said, ﬁWell, like all the 
Jews, she betrayed me .ﬂ She was so vicious
, she was very, very– But to me , she was 
absolutely wonderful. 
 
Q: And why do you think that 
was?  How do you explain that?  
 
A: I cannot explain it. I cannot e
xplain it. The me re fact that sh
e didn™t want to be near me  
but she left me  crusts of bread, that she asked 
me  if I have it well, if everything is fine, 
and if I have fa mily, on the one hand. And then on the other hand, I saw how what she 
did to other people. S
o, I cannot explain it. 
 
Q: You were in Retzow for, what, a couple of months?  
 
A: From the time we left Ravensbrück, which 
probably was February or so, in February. 
Yeah, about a couple of months, right, becau
se the evacuation from Retzow was about 
early April, for 1945. 
 
Q: And, in addition to these cr
umbs of bread, was the food–?  
 
A: Well, the food was better because - I really 
got ahead of my story - but I didn™t say that 
after we - those trucks out of Ravensbrück 
- that brought us in, a
ll the so-called spots 
were filled with us, ma id and this and the othe
r, wome n wer e brought in - in fact, some  of 
the people we knew from Poland - were brought 
into this camp, because there was an air 
force base, a German air force base, not far, a
nd they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or 
whatever. So, these laborers were supposed to
 be working for the - ma ybe not only the air 
force - no, airport, or  whatever you call it.
 Anyhow, once the camp was filled, we found 
that there we re people who we knew from 
the other camps. And, of course, we had it 
very fine now, because having to work for 
theGerman women who di
dn™t really want us 
to mi ngle with the population, so we slept in
 separate quarters under the kitchen. So 

Krysia always brought down a little more brea
d, and so that was really fine. And so we 
got restored again before th
e big evacuation on the road.  
 
Q: I™m having an association. There was a story 
that Krysia told about
 Hania in Auschwitz 
that had to do with food. Do you remember?  
 
A: Yes. Now, Chris reme mbers it much better, 
and I know that Hania fainted and all this, but 
I don™t really recall this. I only reme mber it becau
se Chris told me  about it. I really truly 
didn™t reme mber that. I™m beginning, you know, 
as I analyze and think back, I really 
think I that I obliterated certain things fr
om my mi nd. Because I ha
ve a ve ry distinct 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
80 
 
recollection about certain thi
ngs and none about other things
, so there has to be some  
selective thinking here. I don™t know. 
 
Q: So, you™re now on the road with
 ten other people - ten others?  
 
A: Yes, ten wome n, ten. 
 
Q: Tenwomen. 
 
A: No, we are, the total of us is ten. 
 
Q: And Helena is acting like the SS guard. 
 
A: Yes, Helena is, because  she is wearing the black cape. 
 
Q: And she has blonde hair. 
 
A: She has blonde hair and she speaks Ge
rman very well. And we slide down an 
embankme nt. Because, you know, the traffic 
came to a dead stop. Every - you couldn™t 
go if you tried - everything on the road. It is
n™t that we stopped for our own sake. There 
was no place to move. All the cars and all th
e trucks and all the military equipment and 
all the peasants with the wagons, and ev
erything is stopped dead. And they are 
meanwhile giving out rations 
from Sweden - packages, Red Cross packages from 
Sweden. 
 
Q: On the road?  
 
A: On the road, in the mi ddle of all this. And 
the German women are grabbing the cigarettes 
like crazy - there are cigarettes then - and 
these Ge rman women with whom we served, 
they are grabbing them. And I reme mber getting sardines there; we got sardines. But 

anyhow, I reme mber, we are stuck on this ro
ad, which is comp letely choked up traffic, 
and we slide down an embankme nt - we don™t slide, we go down an e mbankment. The 

fields are a little lower than 
the road on an embankment. And we as far as where there is 
like - no, not snow - cut grass 
piled up. What do you call that?  
 
Q: Hay?  
 
A: Hay, right. We go behind these haystacks and 
we  sit there hoping to 
sit it out, to wait 
until they move on. And before we know it, a person come s over, a ma n. He hears us 

speak Polish, and he asks if we™re Polish. 
And we say, ﬁYes, we™re Polish. We ran away 

from this here, this evacua
tion route.ﬂ And he says, ﬁYou 
know, there is a lot of Poles 
here because we™re working on the, in the farm. Why don™t you go to that house over 

there and tell them I sent 
you, and they™ll put you up.ﬂ So, that™s what happened. We  
walked away. Nobody ever mi ssed us. We  got to
 the villa, it was a German villa, and we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410  
81 
 
stayed there until the Germans came That™s how
 we were liber ated - except, one of the 
girls among the ten was a Russian, and she said
 the Russians rape wome n, so we should 
not stay around, which we had no intentions of
 staying around, no intention. We  just were 
mostly here to get back and find out finally, put
 all of the pieces of 
the puzzle together  to 
see who survived and who– So, very soon, we started toward the railroad and we got on 
the trains going back east. But that was eas
ier said than done because everybody - people 
were so dislocated, and everybody wanted to 
get east, further east. So, we  were on the 
train for a few stops, then we got bumped of
f. And then, there were Russian soldiers 
riding and all sorts of other 
people, and then we got on th
e train again. We didn™t know 
where we were going, but we were
 going east, wherever the trai
n will take us, as far as 
Bibgost (ph). Bibgost (ph) we knew was sort of
 a - what do you call 
it - a cross-, no, sort 
of a central line crossing. We still di
dn™t know - we thought we were going to 
Starachowice, of course. We  just said, ﬁ We™
ll make our way to Poland and from there, 
we™ll worry about going to Starachowice.ﬂ But 
we me t a Russian soldier who was Jewish 
on the train, and he told us, if
 we™re Jewish, not to go back, because it™s not safe in those 
small - he asked us how big a town it was, and we said, ﬁSma ll town.ﬂ And he said, 

ﬁDon™t go back; go to a big ci
ty.ﬂ And we said, ﬁBig city? But we don™t anybody.ﬂ He 
says, ﬁNo, you go to a big city, and you can regi
ster with the Jewish agents. And that™s 
where you can find fa mily, not in a small town.ﬂ
 Which is what we did, we went to Lodz, 
and he gave us an address of his sister, so
 we stayed overnight, and then next day we 
went to register, and we were given a place 
- not an apartment. It was a bo mbed-out 

place, but they assigned it to us, the Jewish ag
ency. And I think they gave us ration cards 
or some thing like that. And soon enough, we 
found out that Uncle Alexander survived, 
that he was in Lodz. And, of course, then we
 started finding out what happened, that all 
these people who were resettled [shakes head
] were no longer alive, because they were 
exterminated. They were not resettled. And 
all the people that mi
ght not show up didn™t 
necessarily get resettled either . They died 
of a million different  causes. If it wasn™t 
starvation, it was sickness. If 
it wasn™t sickness, it was a bullet. But then it came out that 
there were extermination camps, whi c h served 
only the purpose of 
killing en ma sse. And 
that was some thing totally new. We  knew 
about shootings on the highway and on the 
road and starvation and typhus. We  knew; we saw 
it; we were part of it. We never really - 
of course, in Auschwitz, we also knew about
 Auschwitz - but we had no idea about all 
these ot her pl aces, where all this was happeni
ng at the same time. So, the resettlement 

was a euphemi s m, and how the secrets were ke
pt for all those years, when the Germans 
were commi tting the mo st heinous crime of
 all history, I don™t know. I don™t know how 
that could altogether happen without pe
ople knowing, but that™s how it happened. And 
we settled in Lodz, you know, after the war.And Hania and Chris went back to Poland, 

and I told you about Genia (ph)
, that ma id of ours . She abso
lutely said she had nothing, 
and she threatened them. And Mrs.Paliszewska -that night, the little children that came  

back from Auschwitz were killed in my 
home town. And Mrs. Paliszewska - one of 
wome n of the Paliszewska sisters 
worked at the railroad sta
tion, she sold tickets there, 
and they lived very near the railroad station, 
so she secured tickets for them and put them 
on the train and they came  back to Lodz. S
o, that was where the end of the war found us. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

Q: Did this feel - on the one hand, you were 
liberated and free, and on the other hand, you 
find a world of tragedy - so, are you 
very conflicted about what you find? 
 
A: Well, we are really in shock still, becaus
e we survived, and we still cannot figure out how 
it happened that we did survive. We  are not ye
t aware of the entire 
truth of everything. 
Grandmothe r - after all, we had a tremendous
 fa mily, extended fa mily, on my mother™s 
side especially. Originally, there were ni
ne children - I don™t mean children - nine 
siblings, who had all the kids and their kids, a
nd my father™s fa mily wasn™t so large, but it 
was large, too. So, eventually, we pieced it al
l together to find out that people perished. 
But it really took ma ny years before the 
trut h came out because, as you know, people 
were reluctant to talk about it. Everybody was 
busy trying to live, to return to norma l life, 
and nobody wanted - was willing to talk about 
Holocaust . They just lived through it; why 
talk about it?  So that, not too ma ny things
 were yet known, but we knew now for a fa ct 
that Mother had perished in Treblinka, 
because we  knew that the transport out of 
Starachowice, after the original evacuation 
of the Jewish population, from the square 
where they were segregated, that those trai
ns when straight to Treblinka. So, we knew 
that. Then we  knew that a lot of people pe
rished in Starachowice camp, and then they 
perished right along as we got 
along. So, then, of course, it cam
e out that there were such 
camps where slave labor was not required. 
The ultimate purpose of that camp was 

genocide, and that only Jews were being sel
ected for that genocide. So, that was a total 
eye-opener. But, you know, life went on. Chris 
me t Miles and they got ma rried, and they 
sort of adopted me , so I stayed with them. I 
went to school while we
 were living in Lodz. 
Hania, Anna, went to school of diplom
acy in Wa rsaw. But we lived with Uncle 
Alexander - Miles, Chris, I and Uncle Alex
ander. Uncle Alexander went to Sweden 
because hi s wife survived - she survived in one of the camps like Retzow - but she was 

shipped out to Sweden because she was quite
 ill at liberation time. And that was - 
subsequently, Miles, Chris and I went to Ber
lin, and I went to school
 in Berlin. And we 
were in Berlin from about March/ April of ™
46 until Ja nuary of ™47, because we arrive d in 
America February 11
th
, in 1947. So, that chapter was cl
osed. We more or less knew how 
our parents perished. We  also found out from
 pe ople from Ostrowiec what happened to 
Grandma and the aunts. I had 
two aunts living there. One 
was single, and the other, 
Regina - another Regina - 
Aunt Regina, who was ma rrie
d, and Angia, who wasn™t 
ma rried - they lived with the grandmother b
ecause they ran a prin
ting shop. And so they 
went - Regina with her husband and Angia and 
Babka - and Grandma - they all were sent 
to Treblinka, as well, because Ostrowiec wa
s slated for Treblinka. And my father™s 
fa mily, only my cousin survived. One aunt, 
I mean, Uncle Alexander survived with hi s 
wife, and then one of my father™s sister™s
 daughter, survived, and a cousin, Angia, who 
lives in Israel. And the extended family num
bered - I cannot begin to tell you because I 
wouldn™t really know, but really, a very bignumber. And we did have three uncles who 

escaped from Poland in the 20™s. Not escaped, 
but ma de their way out, because they were 
going to be conscripted. So, they ma de their 
way out, and they lived in Canada, so we 
eventually got in touch with them. But as far as the Holocaust stor y of our fa mily is 

concerned, I mean, this is in essence not just
 a narrative covering our
 survival, the three 
of us, but really, the extended fami l y, how 
that was decima ted. Unfortunately, you know?

It was such a fine fa mily, you know, my mothe
r™s big family. But unfor
tunately that™s all 
gone. We ™ve ma de peace with that, you know?  
 
Q: For those, for those people who are watching 
this, there is a fi ve-hour
 audio tape of life 
after the Holocaust which I think will cover 
an enormous a mount of these years, from 
1945 on. I have one final question to ask you, and I don™t know if it™s too big a question 
or too small a question. Do you look back 
- Whe n you look back on your life, on this 
period, do you find a particular effect it has had 
on you or set of effects. And let me  give 
you one example from your sister Chris, be
cause I thought was very interesting. Some one 
asked her why she only has two children, and 
she said, ﬁBecause I 
only have two hands. 
And if some thing happens, I have to be able 
to hold onto each child, and if I had a third 
arm, I woul d have three children.ﬂ Which I f
ound a very interesting kind of effect. And 
I™m wondering if there is some thing in you in
 terms of your life, how you have led your 
life since, what you feel and how it™s affected you–?   
 
A: No, you see, I me ntioned before in the interv
iew that I felt older people had a harder time  
in the camps , and I also think they had a hard
er  time after the war, whether adjusting to a 
new language, a new country, a new culture, or 
whichever, or altogether, even if they 
went back to stay in Europe, adjusting to the 
emptiness, to the horror that was still in the 
soil, so to say, European soil. In my case,
 I found that, because I had never lived and I 
always wanted to taste life, I had no time . I 
had absolutely - I came 
out of the war like a 
racing horse comi ng out of a stable. I was 
ready and willing and ra
ring to go. I wasn™t 
going to look back and I wasn™t going to c
ontemplate and I wasn™t 
going to analyze, I 
wanted to live. And I did. Everything, you know
 that - in fact, when I was in Jefferson 
High School, and Dr. Horowitz, who - th
ey gave me  a big party for my 18
th
 birthday 
because I™d done this and that - so, he said 
he wanted the ne wspaper to write about the 
party, so he brings in people from the 
newspapers - the Jewish paper and the 
Post 
- the 
New York P ost
 was in those days a different pape
r, liberal paper - so, this guy is 
interviewing me for the 
Post
, and he says, ﬁI understand 
you have a number. Could you 
show me  your number? ﬂ So, I showed him the 
number, and he took a picture of my arm, 
and that™s how the 
Post
 printed it - me  and they wrote 
about the birthday party and how 
the whole class was throwing me
 a birthday party and that 
I was a victim. So, when he 
said for me  to show him the number, I thought, 
ﬁIsn™t that ridiculous.ﬂ But I didn™t want 
to disappoint Dr. Horowitz, 
because it was in his house a
nd he was doing the party. I 
thought it was so ridi culous to start dwelling 
on those things. I am just tryi ng to show you 
by illust ra tion how I fe lt. I had no time for that. That was a closed chapter. Now, I didn™t 

go to school yet, I didn™t finish anything, I wa
nted to study, I wanted to do, I wanted to 
live, I wanted - I loved to dance. Here 
I am going to go through the thing - I™d had 
enough of it! And I really th
ink a lot of people felt that
 way if they were yet young 
enough to more or less not to have the br
oken spirit because they had known already 
grown-up life, you see. So, I just 
burst right into
 life in America. In fact, I already had a 
great time in Berlin, when I was in Berlin. But when I came to America, that was 

absolutely everythi ng, because I me an, I couldnow do all of these things, including going 

to school and going to college and havi
ng a great time and marrying and having 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

wonderful children and all this. Of course, now
, because I have translated a lot of works 
on the Holocaust, I discovered - I have been
 discovering constantly new phases of the 
war that I was totally unaware of, because I 
di dn™t even want to dwell on it So, now, all 
these years later, 50 years late
r, I am first finding out about
, okay, I knew about the Lodz 
ghetto, I wrote - I translated a book on this. S
o, I knew about this ghetto and I did this 
camp and such camp, where there is true transl
ation or true people I know. But there is a 
whole world of Holocaust experiences that 
I never even knew about, which I am finding 
out about now. But in those days, when I cam
e to the United States, why would I want to 
bother with that?  Who ha d the time  for that?  
I didn™t have time. I didn™t have time for 
anything, only for forging ahead. And that, I 
think, carried me through life, in the sense 

that, if I look back, of course, I always, al
ways think of my parents and the loss of my 
parents and the loss of my fa mily, the tremendous
 loss of the family. But to regret the life 
that was?  I cannot, because, if I went back
 now, that life would be nothing like the 
wonderful life that I had in America. S
o, you cannot go home  again, and I don™t want to 

go home  again, because  I™ve been to Poland twic
e, and believe me , that would be the last 
place I would want to live  in, under the Co
mmunist regime , especially, you know?  So 

that, to sum it all up, I was lucky enough to
 be young enough to survive the war as a 
youngster, and to still be ab
le - even though at the begi
nning, I did feel a little 
imbalanced, you know, my head was a little bi
t further away - highe
r - not higher - more 
progressive - my head progressed a little better
 than my other emotional, but eventually, 
it evened out, you see?  And of course, I sort 
of apply the experiences
 to my life as it™s 
lived from day to day. For example, everyone said, ﬁHow mu ch do your kids know about 

your background? ﬂ My kids alwa
ys knew everything they wa nted to know. They knew I 
went through the camps, and I told them all 
the time , ﬁPlease ask me . I wi ll never set you 
down and say, ‚Sit down and I want to tell you th
is.™ﬂ I never did that. That was never - I 

said, ﬁBut if you want to know, anything 
you want to know, I will tell you.ﬂ And every 
now and then I would relay an anecdote, and 
of course, they saw the films , and we™re 
very close - our fa mily gene
rally, you know, our fa mily - the Lermans and the Wilsons 
and the kids and the grandkids - we™re ver
y, very close. So you know, the stories are 
exchanged, but not as an imposition. I would ne
ver think of saying, ﬁYou™ve got to hear 
my story.ﬂ I myself wasn™t interested in my
 story when the war ended. I just wanted to 
say, ﬁOkay, that™s anothe r chapter, ca se closed, keep on going.ﬂ So, that was my attitude 

and still is. And, as you noticed, I am very 
short on specifics. For example, my sister 
Anna, she knows a lot of specifics about thehierarchy of the camps and who was what 

and how the camps were run. I don™t know. I ju
st know the particular
s pertaining to my  
personal survival. And the fact that, when 
the war ended, everything was fresh in my 
mi nd, but I wasn™t interested. I wasn™t intere
sted in me , period. I was interested in the 
new life, and the me  could wait. And of cour
se, it waited until now, when every day I am 
finding out about another thing 
that I never knew about. So, th
e other day I read in the 
Polish press about Dietwa gner (ph), this Po
lish community not far from Warsaw. Now, 
60 years later, I am first, first finding out. Now 
I read avidly, whether it™s in Polish or  in 
English, on the subject. But in those years, it
 wasn™t taboo. When I ma rried Victor I told 
him, ﬁAnything you want to know, ask me . Bu
t I don™t have patience nor the time for 
that.ﬂ There were other intell
ectual pursuits and other pursuit
s. I had to fit in all these 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0410

other things that I mi ssed. I™m going to talk
 about Auschwitz and about Ravensbrück?  
Who needs it?

[Picture shown] 
 
A: This picture was taken in Lodz in June 
1945, right after we came  back from Ger many to 
Poland. And I have a few of these at home , and 
because of their size, I am quite sure that 
they were ma de for identification, me aning for 
my passport or ID cards or whichever. But 
this is what you call an official
 picture, and this is really 
what I looked like after we came 
back. I was 15½.  
 
[New picture shown] 
 
A: This is a group picture taken in Berlin, in
 a DP (ph) camp in Berlin, probably some where 
around June or July in 1946. I think our cl
ass was celebrating Lakba
umer (ph). At any 
rate, we were the oldest group in that school
. We were on the high 
school level at that 
time. And if I were to identify, on the extr
eme left is my friend Tunia Rebak Couture 
(ph), who lived in Argentina and unfortunately
 passed away a year ago. Next to her is 
Rachel Kafaigenbaum (ph) whose ma rried 
name  was Gross. Unfortunately, she passed 
away four years ago. Next to her, I am Reni
a or Regina Gelb. Going further to the right 
side is Hanka Drescher (ph), living in Argentin
a, also. We  have kept in touch with her. 
Next to her is a girl whose name  I really fo
rgot, and the last one is Heike, that was her 
name , but I really even don™t reme mber her 
last name . The year was 1946, while I wa s in 
the high school in Berlin, in the 
DP camp in Schlochtenzeit (ph). 
 
[New photo shown] 
 
A: This is a picture of the Ge lbs. On the left

three years before we were ma rried. We me t 
in 1950, and Victor went to the army in the 
meanwhile, because it wa s the Korean war, a
nd I was at Indiana University, completing 
my degree, and when I got back, and Victor
 was just honorably discharged from the 
army, we got married, which 
was the right thing to do. 
 
[New photo shown] 
 
A: This is the pi ctur e of the Gelb fa mily with
 the kids. If I reme mber correctly, it was taken 
at the New York World™s Fair 
in 1964. Going from left to right, Harry Ge lb, after him is 
Victor, next to him is Renia, 
and Paul  Gelb on the extreme ri
ght. Harry wa s at that time  8 
years old and Paul was 4 years old, and we™v
e been to the New York Wor l d™s Fair so 
ma ny ti me s that I couldn™t possibly forget 
it, but I™m glad to have this picture.
