George L. Mosse 
March 13, 1995 
 
Tape One, Side A 
 
Question: Ge orge, tell me  your full name , 
and where and when you were born, please. 
Answer: George L. Mosse. I was born in Berlin, in 1918. 
Q:     What month, and day? 

A:     In September. 20
th
 of Septembe r, 1918. 
Q:     20
th
 of September. Can you tell me  what the ﬁLﬂ stands for? 
A:     Yeah, Lachma nn, i t ™s a double name . 
Lachma nn is my father™s name, Mosse is my 
mother™s name . And -- and my father ma rried into
 the business, it was quite common. That is to 
say my grandfather Mosse founded the newspaper,
 business of newspaper advertising, and my 
father ma rried into it, and th
en took my mother™s name . So 
it™s Lachma nn Mosse, really. But 
when I came  to America, I abbreviated the Lach
mann to an L, and took Mosse, ‚cause I thought 
that was more comprehensible. 

Q:     Can you tell us something about your -- 
your fa mily -- the history of your fa mily?  Can you 

characterize what your family was like? 

A:     Don™t quite know how to characterize it. 
It™s a very typical German Jewish story. They 
came, with some  exceptions, from the east, from -- from the region between Poland and 

Germany. And on both sides, the Lachma nn and th
e Mosse side, the -- towards 1860, the sons 
emigrated to Berlin. It wa s common, too, Berlin 
was becomi ng the center, yes?  And there they 

founded a business, I mean a busin
ess [indecipherable] my grandfat
her on the Lachmann side, to 
start with that fi rst. My gra
ndfather Lachma nn s i de was a very 
notable grain dealer, yes, who 
played some  role in German history, in fact, 
because in the Franco-Prussian war, the army -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
2 
 
nobody knew where the French army was that you wa
nted to fight, and as
 a grain dealer, he 
became sort of the, how would you say, the intelligence ma n for Bis marck, and the German 
army, yes? And he was offe red nob
ility, which was very rare  for a Jew. But he refused it. Like 
my other grandfather refused it too. These people 
were good liberals, the aristocracy was not -- 
was not something they desired. S
o, and then the grandfathers were
 the great thing, and then my 
father was his grandson, of this Salomon Lach
mann, who was the notable grain dealer, and so 
on, yes. And on the other side, as of course become  more fa mous through the years, because my 

grandfather Mosse, who came fr om a small village
 in Posen, ca lled Greiz, came to Berlin, and 

went into the -- went into the advertising, so 
to speak, yes, what was then 1850™s. And in the 
1860™s he had the idea of having an advertising 
agency where you could advertise not just for 
one paper, but for all papers. That wa s quite new some thing then, yes. And that™s what was the 

basis of what came after, for what came  a fter 
was in 1867, the founding of the Berliner Tageblatt 
which -- and then other newspapers publishi
ng the address book for Ger many, yes, and the 
ma tters of this nature. And th
is publishing empire, you could r
eally call it, he
 found it on the 
business of the advertising. that was the basis. 
And he had no children, only my mother. So my 
father married into the business, and when my 
grandfather died in 1920, he became the head of 
this business. 

Q:     What was your chi -- excu
se me, what was your childhood like? 
A:     We ll, I grew up in a luxury that I suppos
e seemed nor mal to me  then, but today seems to 
me  entirely un-norma l, yes?  We  had a house in L,
 and an estate in –-- about 45 mi nutes from 
Berlin, yes. And other estates, 
but that™s the important one: 45 mi
nutes from Berlin. And I spent 
my time between these two, Berlin
 and the estate, yes, until I 
went to boarding school. And in 
these --  in the -- in the house in Berlin and in th
e estates, of course, ther
e were servants, usually a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
3 
 
couple, butler and cook, you know, kitchen ma id. My 
father once in our Berlin house, me t a girl 
on the stairs and said, ﬁWhat are you doing here? ﬂ  
She said, ﬁI am the kitchen ma id.ﬂ Of course, 
he didn™t know who these people were. And -- yo
u know, and other kinds of ma ids, yes. And 
then, of course, as children, we [indecipherable]
 had governesses. First we  had a nursema id, and 
then we had governesses, and the governess were
 chosen by language. My first governesses were 
all French, Fr ench ladies. They didn™t last l
ong with me , ‚cause I was very naughty. But they 
were French ladies, and then came an English lad
y. So I learned French first, and English then.  
Q:     You were naughty, what does that mean? 
A:     We ll, I don™t know, I -- I suppose I ma de he
r life very unpleasant. 
They were all French 
ladies of a conservative cast. Until I was fair
ly old I thought French was -- France was giv -- 
governed by kings, because of these ladies I had, 
yes. So yes, it was a luxury. I had my  own car 
and driver. Then eventually in our estate, I 
had my own little car which -- which I drove around 

the park.  
Q:     You had a brother and a sister? 
A:     Yes, indeed. They™re older than I was, 
much older. Seven years 
-- five and seven years 
older. 

Q:     So Hilda is se -- is fi -- 

A:     Wa s the oldest. 

Q:     She was the oldest? 

A:     Yeah, my sister was th
e oldest, seven years ol
der. My brother was about six years older. 
Q:     We re you close? 

A:     We ll, the age difference is too big. My br
other died very early, in 
1958. But with my sister 
I was -- I was close, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310

Q:     What about your relationship with your -- 
with your parents, since 
you were in some  way 
raised by them?  
A:     We ll, we really didn™t have much relatio
nship with our parents. My parents were in public 
life in Berlin, through what they 
occupied, yes. So they were al
ways going, or -- going out, or 
other things, yes. One™s immediat
e relationships were with one™s governess. And then when I 
was 10, I was sent to boarding school, and from then on I was in boarding school from the age of 

10, to the age of 18. 18 - 19, yes. So you didn™t ha
ve close relations with
 your parents; no, not 
really.  

Q:     What was school like for you before 
you went off to boarding school, where did you go -- 
A:     I have very dim me mories of that, 
of pre-school, as we woul
d say. Very dim. Frau 
Wunderlich was the name of it, and I™ve -- I™ve ha
rdly any me mories of it, I can™t quite tell you 
why.  

Q:     Do you have me mories of being in
 your house during that period, even without 
[indecipherable] 

A:     Oh yes, I have me mories of being in th
e house, yes, but not of this school. I mean, that™s 
where I learned to read and write
 after all, but I have umf -- I 
don™t know, it™s just blotted out. 
Q:     When you went to school -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- when you were sent away to boarding school -- 

A:     Yes. 

Q:     -- how old were you, 10? 

A:     10. 

Q:     And where did you go? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
5 
 
A:     That was a very famous Ger man school
, one of the mo st famous boarding schools in 
Germany. M y father had a -- a friend, a friend -- 
or friend is said too much, a companion, when 
he grew up in his high school gymna sium, yes, ca
lled Kurt Hahn. And Kurt Hahn is a fascinating 
character in his own right. Ku
rt Hahn was -- became  secretary to the Prince of Baden, who 
became chancellor -- interim chancellor. And after the first World Wa r, 
in the castle of the 
prince, he founded a boarding school, on the E
nglish model, on the English model, which 
became a boarding school si -- it™s di fficult to sa
y. It became  a boarding school -- it™s -- I me an, 
it™s not difficult to say, it™s just I have to find th
e right words. It became  a boarding school for the 
aristocracy, yes. For example, 
the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah. The queen of Greece. I 
used to dunk her pigt ails into ink. I mean, the 
late queen of Greece, yes. Didn™t like her very 
much as a child. And all sorts of yes, royalty, and 
rich families, but also poor. But it™s typical of 
the atmosphere of the school that the free places,or scholarship places were reserved for sons 
and daughters of generals of the first World Wa r,
 yeah. Or people, officers who™d fallen in the 
first World War, some thing like that, yes. I thi
nk that was very typical,
 though the plus of the 
school was that it was one of a very few, I th
ink the only German boarding school that was co-
educational. And that was not on the English 
model, and that was a great plus, yes. But 
otherwise, it™s very strict di
scipline, as you can well imagine, 
yes. And I don™t think the teaching 
was very good, I don™t think you learned a lot, but your character was built. 

Q:     Did you like school? 

A:     Yes, I liked school, because I™m a bully
 by na ture, and did very well. ‚Cause in these 
boarding schools, if you™re not a bully by nature, 
you don™t do very well. I did very we ll indeed 
in the two boarding schools I went
 to, ‚cause eventually I we nt 
to an English boarding school, of 
course, when Hitler came in. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310

Q:     Explain to me  wha t  you mean by 
if you™re not a bully 
you don™t do very well. 
A:     If you™re not a bully you don™t do very well. 
Q:     What does that me an? 

A:     We ll, if your s -- boys 
together in a boarding 
school, yes, I mean, there™s a lot of bullying, 
you know, after all, yes? And it™s children among 
themselves, especially young teenagers can be 
very brutal. But all this was controlled by a di
scipline which I now think, looking back on it, was 
really excellent and doesn™t exist 
in this country at all. For exam
ple, from -- from the age of 10 
on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed ‚t
il the age of 18, you got
 some thing called -- if 
you were especially good -- this
 was a privilege, you got a trai
ning plan, which was a plan on 
which there was written, have you brushed your 
teeth, have you done your run in the morning, 
have you had your cold shower, yes?  You know
?  Have you cheated today, and so on. And you 
put a plus and mi nus whether you did it or 
not. And nobody cheated. Wa s a privilege, nobody 

cheated. And that -- that, I think, ma kes up 
for all the deficiencies of the school. 
Q:     Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated? 
A:     It was just in the atmosphere, it wa
s a privilege, it wouldn™t ha
ve occurred to anybody to 
cheat. It was not done. The best way of putting 
it: it was simply not done. And that sort of 
training is totally absent in Am
erican education, unfortunately. 
Q:     George, growing up in -- in such a house
hold, with parents who are, 
in a real sense, public 
figures, what does that mean about who you me et
, who comes into the house, what was -- 
A:     Well, you met interest
ing people. Of course I was muc h too young to notice interesting 
people, yes? I mean, for example, one day L
itvinov, the -- the -- the 
Russian, first foreign 
mi nister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the house,
 a party or some thing, and I was allowed to 
go into the drawing room downstairs, which as a ru
le I was not, of course, yes?  And he had on a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
7 
 
what you call it, formal dress, yes? And I stood infront of him, I™m told, and pointed at him, to 
the great embarrassme nt of everybody, and said, ﬁA
 Bolshevik?  How come he™s dressed that 
way? ﬂ Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not 
very apt at business, bu
t who had great cultural 
interests, above all music, mo
stly musicians came  into our 
house. Every Christma s -- you see, 
part of the daily rhythm was vacations in thos
e da ys, and the vacations were norme d. In other 
words, every winter we went sk
iing, regardless, every winter. Us
ually to Saint Moritz, yes, and 
later on to Ar osa, but every winter we went 
skiing, and every summer we had a house in the 
Alps. So, this was the rhythm. But the Christma se
s, for example, we always spent with a -- the 
most fa mous German conductor, I suppose, almost
, of the century, called 
Fuertwangler. With the 
Fuertwanglers we spent the Christma s. He didn™
t behave very well afte
r 1933, that™s another 
story. But we  spent Christma s at Fuertwanglers. 
And there were always people from the musical 
world, and sometimes fr om the theater world, 
who came to the house, but I was too young, I 
wasn™t allowed to be present, you know. 
Q:     Did they also, the musi -- the 
musicians come  and play concerts and -- 
A:     Yes, because in our Berlin house th
ere was a concert hall built on, ye s. Big room where 
they played. Rubinstein played, 
and so that I was allowed to go 
and hear. Rubinstein played and 
all sorts of pe ople played, because my father wa
s a Huberma nn above all, my father gave the 
first violin to Hubermann. So, Hubermann play
ed and so on, yes, yes, mm-hm. Very, very 
musical household, but there were
 also other things. My gran
dmother founded, for example, 
what we would call in Be rlin, homes  for wayw
ard girls, yes. And this became  a society 
[indecipherable] society wome n. 
Eve r y woma n adopted one of these homes for wayward girls. 
And my mother was thepresident 
of it. So they me t, of cour se, in the house, these society 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
8 
 
women, and the home for wayward gi
rls. I don™t know what they mean
 by wayward girls, to this 
day I can™t tell you. But that™s what it was, yeah. 
Q:     Wa s this typical, this
 philanthropic [indecipherable] 
A:     Oh yes, yes, yes, very much, ye s, ye
s, yes, every -- everybody had his philanthropy in these 
very wealthy houses -- home s, yes, yes. 

Q:     What was that about?  I mean, it wa
s -- was -- why was it so typical, do you think?   
A:     We ll, that was just a thing you di
d, I mean, you -- you -- you -- especially if you were 
Jewish, it™s part of assimilation for the Jews, ye
s, to be part -- for example, my grandfather 
founded a -- an orphanage, big Berlin orphanage, 
still stands, a Berlin orphanage, you know, for 
Jewish and Christian children, you di
d that sort of thing. That was 
part of being integrated into 
the society, if you like, yes.  

Q:     In -- in what sense was your family
 Jewish?  Wa s there any religious association? 
A:     Oh yes, both my gr andfather and father 
were very involved with the Jewish reform. Now 
Jewish reform in Germa ny was a complete re
form, much mo re than anything you know about 
today, yes. And they were very involved with it
 indeed, yes. Both, my grandfather Mosse, and 
my father. And they did in our estate always
, the synagogue youth clubs
 and things came out, 
yes. 

Q:     So were you involved in that also? 

A:     No, no, I was in boarding school, no. No, no, uh-uh.  

Q:     Did you one day a -- 

A:     I was -- I was kicked out of the -- 
of what we called Sunday school, cause it me t on 
Sunday, cause I was so naughty. Yes, an effort wa
s ma de to send me  to religious school, and it 
didn™t last long.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310

Q:     Did you once express to your fath
er an interest in becoming a rabbi? 
A:     Yes, I did. I don™t really know why. I did e
xpress that interest, and 
-- I don™t know what got 
into me . But anyway, my father had a very good 
cure, he thought, and he
 was right. He put me  
into a car, into our car, and a -- 
said to the chauffeur to drive to the Scheunenviertel, that™s the 
Jewish quarter of Berlin, yes. A
nd there he took me  and said -- and showed me  these pious Jews, 
you know, with the peyes, and dark, you know. And 
said, ﬁDo you want to be like them? ﬂ  And I 

said, ﬁOf course not.ﬂ So that was that. 

Q:     George, what do you experience as a 
young child growing up?  Whe n do you reme mber the 
national socialists politicalupheaval? Do you -- anti-Semitism -- 

A:     We ll there™s one thing that mu st be sai
d, I think, straight away. Growing up after the war, 
with the lost war, revolution, c
ounter revolution and so on, yes. 
My generation isn™t like other 
generations, especially today. We  were always  politicized. My first me
mories are political 
me mories. The first thing I reme mber from ch
ildhood are political me mories. For example, my 
mother taking me  to a soup kitchen for the une
mployed, which she ran, yes, yeah. For example, 
leaning out of the window one day and there were
 no lights on in the square, what™s happened?  
President Ebert di ed, the president of the re
public. These kind of me mo
ries, yes, political 
me mories. I think they became less as I grew olde
r for awhile, but I was ve ry much politicized. 
Q:     In the late 20™s, when you start board
ing school Œ ‚cause it would be ™28 when you were 
10. 
A:     Yes, right. 

Q:     Are you feeling any of the political move ments at this time ?  

A:     No, no, no, no, no. 

Q:     When did -- when do you -- 
does that begin to affect you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
10 
 
A:     No, no. I think a little 
later, a few years later, when I was in Berlin, where I was at the 
boarding school, where we knew that some  of ou
r teachers we re seen in a neighboring town, 
Uberlingen  in Nazi uniform. They didn™t dare ca
rry it in the school, but 
in the neighboring town. 
Of course, the gymnastics teacher, you know, in
 uniform. We  knew that, yes. And swastikas 
were burned on the hills around the school, that I 
reme mber, too, yes. And indeed, things were 
already so relatively tight, that when you went to
 take the train to school
, it was quite -- it was a 
long train ride, seven -- six, se
ven hours, some thing like, yeah, you were given some thing that 
the Jewish defense organization put up -- put -- pu
t out, called the Anti-Ant
i, that  is the name. 
And it was a kind of folder, yes, where you 
looked through. And if some body said to you, the 
Jews are bad, you looked through, and you said, ﬁBut 
there™s Einstein.ﬂ Things like that. It™s a 
wonderful document because it shows how the Je
ws tried to combat anti-Se mitism rationally, 
yes, ‚cause this folder wa s divided into parts, 
yes. I mean, Jewish inventors, Jewish generals, 
well there wa sn™t much there. You know, Jewish 
so and so. And then you 
just had to look it up. 
Q:     Did you carry one of these? 
A:     Yes. I still have 
it. It™s quite precious now. 
Q:     What did you think of it, when you we
re young, carrying this around, I mean, does it ma ke 
sense to you?   

A:     No, I thought it was good, because I was 
the historian, I didn™t know
 how stupid it is to 
counter irrationality with rationa
lity. I wasn™t brought up in a 
household where irrationality was 
prized. So I thought it was pe
rfectly all right. I never ha
d a chance to use it, though. 
Q:     Did this ever frighten you? 

A:     No, I don™t reme mber being 
really frightened by it a great deal. 
Q:     Do you reme mber your first experience with anti-Semitism, with -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
11 
 
A:     No, not really. No. You see, there wa
s other anti-Semitism in school, but never directed 
against me , because I was good at 
sports, and that of course,kosherizes you in boarding school. 
And I became  a prefect, so I could tyrannize the 
other kids, and they couldn™t tyrannize me . So 
that was a good -- a good thing, yes.
 So, no, I didn™t. It was never 
directed against me. For some  
reason I can just tell you how I 
saw it, or I experienced it. I 
never really ex
perienced anti-
Se mitism. Sometimes in our vacations in France la
ter on, in the 30™s, I experienced it in France, 
but not in my youth, I mean, in those days. 

Q:     We re you having political conversations 
with your friends in boa
rding school about what 
was going on. 

A:     Oh no, I don™t remember any. I™m sure I di
d, but I just don™t reme mber it. There were other 

things to talk about, I mean, you know, it™s not some
thing that™s necessarily foremo st -- or I said 
the me mories are politicized. Yes, we must have
 had political con -- we
ll, I don™t reme mber it. 
Q:     Do you have any particular close frie
nds that you had during that time who are -- were 
important to you? 

A:     None who rema ined important to me , 
none . We ll, the war intervened, and it must not be 

forgotten that Hitler put 
aristocrats in the first ro
w of soldiers in Poland. So an awful lot of my 
friends in Salem were killed in ™39, immedi
ately, ‚cause they were aristocrats. 
Q:     Your family, you, your t -- your brother, si
ster, mother and father left  Germany in January 
of ™33. 

A:     Mm-hm.  

Q:     How c o me  so -- so quickly -- 

A:     We ll, because we were exposed politically. 

Q:     Can you explain that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
12 
 
A:     It isn™t only a Jewish thing. We ll, beca
use the newspapers were liberal newspapers, which 
never compromi sed, they really didn™t, never comp
romi sed with the Nazis or anything like that. 
And so -- so obviously we were one of the ma in ta
rgets of Hitler -- of Hitler™s ire, I me an, he 
me ntioned us quite often, so -- and there were 
demonstrations in front of our house and so on. 
My mother left  straight away after the fi rst de
monstration in front of 
our house, I think. My 
father and my brother and sister a 
little later, and I latest of all. 
Q:     Wa s you mother beaten at all? 
A:     No, no. 

Q:     No. Was any me mber of your f-fa mily -- 

A:     No. 

Q:     -- picked up, hurt? 

A:     No, no, no. 

Q:     No. 
A:     No. 
Q:     Where did your mother go when she -- 

A:     Oh, wa -- don™t we -- German Jews l
ooked to France, and especially my fa mily. For 
example, my father was the first -- after the firs
t World Wa r, took a lot of
 courage to invite a 
French singer [indecipherable] Gu
ilbert to sing in Paris in our c
oncert thing, you see. That took a 
great deal of courage. And we were very li
nked to France. Indeed, in the end, the French 
ambassador ma de it in Germany, François Poncet, ma de it possible for my grandmother to come  

out. So, they were -- oh, everybody 
went to France, except me. 
Q:     Why were you last? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
13 
 
A:     Well, at -- first of a
ll I was last because I was bad, generally, and I ha d to do -- what do you 
call it, after school, what do you call 
it if you have to stay after sc
hool, yeah?  I had to stay after 
school, and my parents and everybody was out. A
nd Hitler ma de a decree 
that I think -- I -- I 
always get that wrong, but let™s say towards the 
first of February or some thing, you -- not the 
first of February, the 12
th
 of February, you had to have a permit to leave Germany, yes. That was 
unprecedented, that ne ver been before, yes. And 
I wouldn™t have gotten 
it, because the Nazis 
would have taken me  hostage for the fa mily, a nd the newspapers, and everything, yes. So my 
parents pleaded, but the headmi stress of my pre-
school -- I wa s, of course, in pre-school--who 
was a real Protestant type, a Verm
ont Protestant type, but a real Pr
ussian Protestant type, said no, 
that I must stay till I have finished my duty afte
r school, you see. So, the re
sult of that is -- no, I 
mean she was a wonderful woma n, she got into ŒFraeulein Koeppen was her name , she got into 

prison eventually because she refused to teach 
ﬁMein Kamp fﬂ, but she refused to teach ﬁMein 
Ka mpfﬂ in German class, because it was ba
d German, not be cause we -- you know, it was bad 
German. It is bad Germa n, yeah, so she was a 
real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real 
type, as it we re. So I was late, and the way to 
leave was via the ferry across Lake Constance, 
‚cause that™s near where the school was. So I came 
to the ferry, and that was the last ferry before 
this so-called ﬁsicht vermerk,ﬂ this permit -- th
e exit permit, yeah. And there were nothing but 
Brown Shirts on either side, yes. And when you 
had to run through them, as it were, yes. And -- 
and it was my luck that just before Hitler ha d me ntioned us, in some  way. Mosse, Jew press, you 

know, and so on. So I came  there, and I said, well
, I™m done for, because all they did is hel -- 
hold me  back five mi nut es and the ferry would 
be gone and they had me . And indeed, when I 

showed my passport,they looked 
at each other and passed it from 
one SA man to another. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
14 
 
didn™t stop me . That™s Germany. It was five mi nut
e to 12, not 12. So that™s why I™m here today, 
yes. Yeah. 
Q:     George, talk a little bit 
about being liberal Jews, and the impor
tance of that in that -- in that 
context. Because often pe ople talk about anti-Semitism, but not a
bout the political -- 
A:     We ll, the political orie
ntation of most Jews, German Je
ws, most Jews in Europe, was a 
liberal or ient ation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenme nt. That had give n them the 

chance of emancipation, to become  part of the co mmunity as it were. And this chance they used, 

and what rema ined of it was a belief, let us say in 
-- in -- in processes, not 
in finished thing -- in 
other words, in Germany -- there™s one other fact
or perhaps I should explain. There is the word 
ﬁBildungﬂ, which means -- it™s a German wor
d, essentially European word, which me ans 

cultivate your character, cultivate yourself. And 
the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the 
idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature
, his own character, yes. Didn™t ma tter were 
you Jews and Christians, because this was a proce
ss. This was not a finished product, like nation 
or anythi ng else: this was a process. Now, th
is fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, 
because that was their way to integration, yes? So that you will find, for example in Germany, 

yeah, that the Jews supporte
d the small liberal party, wh
ich wa s tiny by 1933, yes, our 
newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, 
yes. Which meant most 
of the serious press 
supported the tiny liberal party, wh
en it obviously had no chance. And 
of course, as in a way the 
fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, 
but also on freedom, ec onomi c freedom, and so 
on, yes. They didn™t see -- my father, for exampl
e , not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 
1920™s, the social democ r ats were the great cham
pions of the Jews in Germany, yes. But they 

didn™t see it, they still saw the social democra
tic Marxist rhetoric as
 an enemy, yes. So I 
reme mber when my sister first voted social de
mo cratic. That was terrible row in the house, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
15 
 
terrible row. And my mother 
imme di ately began with the toot
hbrush, ﬁdo you want to share your 
toothbrush? That was her reacti
on to everything on socialist, 
you see. It was terrible, though. 
Illegitima te children were also me ntioned, and God knows why. I me an, today it seems 
ridiculous, but that™s how social democrats were
 perceived, though they we
re the real champions 
of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political li
berals in Germany, that -- you know. But they will 
rema in liberals to the very end, that is the German
 Jewish tradition, and it™s a very fine  tradition. 
In a way you can put it this way, that it were th
e German Jews who carried the liberal tradition 
from 1933 through to 1945. Who transmitted it.  

Q:     Wa s you sister unusual? 

A:     What do you mean? 

Q:     In terms of the kind of support that she 
was giving?  That she was a 
social demo crat within 
the context of -- 

A:     We ll, she was more  left than social demo
crat in the end, oh yes, yes, yes. Wa s s he unusual?  
No, ma ny of the children of these very rich Jews
 became socialists, of cour se, yes. Some became 
communists, it™s well known, yes. No, she worked 
up in the north of Berlin, in the We dding, the 
working class part, with children at
 that time  in her life. And told my father, for example, that 
working class children already came to -- came to th
e meetings with little Nazi daggers in thei r 
belt, my father should take Hitle
r seriously. My father thought till 
the last that Hitler be longed in 
the comi c papers -- pages of the newspaper, yes.
 After all, that™s what
 Hitler, you know, helped 
him so muc h that ev
erybody undervalued him. 
Q:     You went to a Hitler
 ra -- rally, is that right? 

A:     I once went from home, yes.  

Q:     What -- what year was that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
16 
 
A:     I think it was a bet with my sister. What? 
Q:     It was a bet with your sister? 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     What does that me an? 

A:     She said I wouldn™t,
 I said I would, too. So -- 

Q:     So when -- when did you go? 

A:     That must have been 1931 or so. 

Q:     What was your impression? 

A:     Oh, it was ma rvelous, I mean [i ndeciphe
rable]. You were carried away, of course. The -- 
his charisma , which you can™t experience in f
ilm, you had to experience it in person, his 
charisma  and the move me nts of the  crowd were heady, I mean, you were carried away. I mean, 

there must have been thousands of people, and th
ey all did the same  thing, and they all spoke the 
same thing. It didn™t matter what he said, that doe
sn™t ma tter in this kind of political liturgy that 
much. So you were carried away. 

Q:     So did you go home and tell your sister about this? 

A:     Yes, certainly. 

Q:     Talk about it? Wh at was -- 

A:     Oh, she says, that™s typical of you, or something. Yes. 

Q:     Did you have any worry about this guy? 

A:     No.  

Q:     So you leave Germany. 

A:     Yes, mm-hm. 

Q:     Do you go to France, or do you go to Switzerland? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
17 
 
A:     No, I go to -- well, fi
rst I go to Switzerland, cause you s
ee, what happened after ™33, the 
advertising agencies of ours, wh
ich were outside Germany, t hey went with the family, yes, not 
with the German, but with the family. And the 
biggest of those was in Switzerland. Indeed, if 
you go to Zurich, have -- I don™t know if you™ve been
 to Zurich, but in the Limmatquais the chief 
you know, where the canal is, there is one house that
 to this day has Mosse house on it. That was 
the headquarters of our Swiss business, which 
was very large. So first we went on to 
Switzerland, for one year I we
nt to a Swiss boarding school. 
Q:     And everybody™s together? 

A:     No, no, nobody™s together, because my brot
her imme di ately went to study in Zurich, my 
sister went to study me di
cine and so on in Basel, you know, a
nd I stayed one year in a boarding 
school near Zurich. My parents 
were already divor -- separated, 
my father was in Paris, my 
mother immediately went  to Juan-les-Pins, the Riviera.  

Q:     So what it -- was that 
like, was that -- life di
dn™t change very much in some  way for you, or 
was this [indecipherable] 

A:     No, life™s changed in every way. 

Q:     Can you describe it? 

A:     I mean, it was -- it was hard. The Swi
ss boarding school wasn™t particularly good, I have 

very few me mories of it. But then I we nt to 
English boarding school, and that was hard, because 
you had to adjust, you had a language, nobody there kne
w German, it wasn™t really in the cards. 
You had to adjust and so on, yes. But it was 
a very good boarding school, the Quaker boarding 
school, run by the Society of Friends. A good boardi
ng school, and -- and I 
-- I made it all right, 
yes. But everything wa -- became a hassle, because in
 the first list of si -- of people who lost their 
citizenship, we were in that fi
rst list, including me
, all of 15. So having no citizenship in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
18 
 
modern world was a terrible fate. So everythi
ng became a problem. Everything, yes. Fi rst, when 
you visited your mother in yo -- pare
nt, father, in France, you had to have permit de sejour. Wa s 
dreadful and humiliating. These women there, and th
ese --  these offi cial things in France are 
unbelievable, unbelievable, yes. 
Q:     What did they do? 

A:     I mean, they™re -- they™re
 just -- just a bureaucracy that
 you can™t imagine. And very nasty, 
because we were me re immigrants
, and nothing, nothing, yeah. So th
at wasn™t a big change, yes. 
You had to do that everywhere. Fo
r example, whenever I went to 
Switzerland to see my sister or  
brother, I had to -- my fa ther, I -- my father had to
 deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out 
again. Do you know?  The Swiss were the worst, that™s not generally realized. The ﬁJﬂ for Jew in 

your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at
 all. It was a Swiss idea, so they could keep 
Jews out, yeah. That isn™t enough -- emphasized e
nough, yes. So I didn™t -- so then we all got 
different passports, of course. My sister, because
 it was very -- she knew how to do things, went 
-- there was one consul in Naples
, Reitling was his name , who gave 
Jews passports without a ‚Jﬂ. 
And she got one. And th -- almost the same  thing happened to me , I went in London to get a new 

passport without a ﬁJﬂ, you know, and the consular
 official talked to me  and shoved me over 
surrept itiously, a passport without a ﬁJﬂ. You see, there were decent people around, yes. So for 

awhile I ha d a passport, then my brother became a Turk for awhile because we had very good 

Turkish connections, yes. And then this German 
passport expired in a very short time , and my 
father got the Prime Minister of
 Luxemburg to forge his own passport, which I still have, for me , 
yes, without expiry date, so I traveled for about
 three years on a Luxemb urgian passport, which 
was embarrassing when I me t some body from Luxemburg because I™d ne ve r been there, of 

course, in my life. And today I keep it in
 case the Americans are cheeky, I say, me , a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
19 
 
Luxemburgi an, you know. And wha t  I learned from th
at is you can never have enough passports, 
believe me , you can never have enough passports.  
Q:     So tell me  more about what it™s -- wh
at it™s like during this 
time, you™re traveling around 
the -- this is before 1939, be
tween ™33, and ™34, and -- 
A:     In ™39, when I was first in Bootham, in
 this school in York, and then every vacation -- don™t 
forget you™re six months in, six months out usua
lly in England in those days. So during the long 
vacations I went first to my father and stepmother
 in Paris and then to my mother in Juan-les-
Pins  usually, yes. Divided it. Or if it is 
summer, my mother had a house in Charmoni x in the 
Montblanc -- I mean, in the Alps, so I went to 
Paris and Charmonix. You se
e, in winter I went 
skiing. So -- 

Q:     So during this period, at least, there is 
support from all the busines
ses that are outside of 
Germany. 

A:     Yes, indeed, mm-hm, yes. 
Q:     Right. And you father is still working at this? 
A:     Yes, right, he had an office in Paris and he still worked at this, yes. But Hitler took them 

one by one. Every time he con -- conquered a countr
y, a business went out, you see, yeah. So it 
must have been difficult, I wasn™t in -- you know, 
in the loop that I could 
say what the discussion 
was about finances. But it was certainly difficult.
 I would say that when I reme mber -- also I 
should add that is, yes, I reme mber when we left in
 ™33, we first went to Zurich, to a hotel, yeah, 
and that I reme mber visit -- vividl
y, cause that hotel was full of é migrés, sudden émigrés. It just 
happened, just happened. Émigrés who were quite fa
mous. The literary cri
tic of our paper, for 
example, Ke rr was there, and all sorts of peopl
e. And the whole thing I always thought, even 

then, must have been like the refugees from the French revolution sort of atmosphere, yes. But I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
20 
 
lost it cause I was bitten by my dog -- by a dog th
en, the first time  I was ever bitten by a dog. But 
nevermind, it had nothing to do with the greater 
events. So anyway, that I reme mber vividly. 
And the next episode that I reme mbe r  vividly isthat Goering called my fa
ther back, and he said, 
ﬁI want to talk to you, and if you don™t come  back, 
we™ll take your mother.ﬂ And so -- his sisters 
were still there, yes, hostage. So my father, w
ho must have been a very courageous ma n -- well, 
he fought in the first Wor l d War-- I guess, went
 onto the train to Berlin, to Goering. And nobody 
knows what really transpired, but th
ere is a secret history here, whic
h has never been really scru -
- it™s never been inve
stigated by scholars, how many Jews  were Aryanized. ‚Cause my f -- 
Goering offered my father Aryanization. There we re
 others, some  very famous, the German chief 
of the Luftwaffe, General Milch wa
s Aryanized. Now why he  did this 
is a general di
spute. Either 
-- I don™t think it™s cause he wanted to use the 
advertising agencies as spy places, he  had enough 
spy places. Maybe he wanted respectability, and 
he would have -- you know, he would have had 
him ma ybe for a year, and then, 
yo -- you know, to Dachau, or some thing else, yeah?  I have no 
idea. Anyway, my father refused, and was escorted
 back on the train by the chief -- then chief of 
the German secret police, a ma n called Bergma nn, 
the first chief of the Nazi secret police. And 
we think he should have been murdered on th
e train, but he wa sn™t. And Bergma nn wr ote his 
me moirs where he also talks about this, and he 
came back. So that was the next episode. And 
that, of course, I reme mber, yeah, cause there we
re some  anxieties, you can imagine, yes?  But 
then it must be said that in
 these early days, the Nazis asked other people to come  back. For 
example, the - our chief editor, Theo DeWo
lfe, who was a [indecipherable] ma n, has a 
correspondence, and Goebbels asked him to come 
back. They wanted respectability for a period. 
I think that™s really
 the explanation. 
Q:     Did your father™s sisters then get out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
21 
 
A:     Yes, yes, everybody got
 out, mm-hm. Yes, everybody got out. 
Q:     So what are you studying during this period
?  Does it -- are -- is -- 
is the education better 
when you™re in -- 
A:     In England? 

Q:     -- England?    

A:     Yes, much. Oh, no comparison. I had a w
onderful education. I had a history ma ster, Leslie 
Gilbert, who I™m sure got me  involved in history 
as he did others. Many great British historians 
of my generation come  from Bootham because of Le
slie Gilbert, yes. He put the right kind of 
books into my hand. We had a ma rvelous Englis
h teacher who did what I™ve neve r seen done 
since. He gave us a list of all the Victoriannovels, and we read them all, because when you™re 

about 17 and 18, that™s the time to read, you 
know, the Bronte™s, and you know, Trollope and 
everything. It was just wonderful, it was a w
onderful education, except science. Typically 
British. They didn™t know anything about science, 
and we had a terrible -- all I learned in 
science, all I know about science to this day is 
to roast chestnuts on Buns
en burners. That™s all I 
know about science to this day. It™s enough, it™s gotten me  this far.  

Q:     So what is life in exile lik
e then?  Do you feel like a refugee -- 
A:     We ll, you -- yes, yes -- 

Q:     -- except [indecipherable] 

A:     -- yes, I reme mber my sister got very fu
rious one day, we were lean
ing out of a train again, 
and I said, ﬁWhy a m I s -- always saying good-by
e?ﬂ And that™s exile. You™re always saying 
good-bye, you™re always on trains. Th
at™s partly the family situa
tion, but still, you™re always on 
trains, there™s really no really permanent home, 
my -- all -- everybody rented, yes. No, there is no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
22 
 
center, but then my fa mi ly was never really my 
c e nter in that sense in
 the boarding school. But 
still, yes, that was diffi
cult, I think, yes, yes.  
Q:     Did you want to go be with your 
mother or your father 
or your sister, as -- 
A:     No, I was very fond of my stepmother; I 
was very close to my stepmother. Yes, that was 
lovely. 
Q:     So that was different for you, given that you -- 

A:     Yes, yes, because I didn™t know a stepmother existed until emigration, because my parents 

typically thought they couldn™t ge
t divorced as long as they had th
is public position, and the anti-
Se mitism and so on, you know, made them stay together, or  so mething like that. But once the 

emigration there was no longer that 
pressure, and so eventually he ma rried my stepmot her, who -

- who I was very, very close to. 

Q:     What was she like? 

A:     We ll, she™d studied theology, Christia
n theology. I mean, she wa
s Jewish by race if you 
want to go to that, but she studied Christian theo
logy, she had been a -- a Christian counselor to 
the students at the University of
 Berlin, yes. And her father had been a mi nor novelist, if you like 

to put it that -- yes, I™m very 
close to her son, too. She™d ma rried
 a fa -- a country parson in the 
first marriage, yes, in a small village. And the 
son, and the grandchildren -- the grandchildren 
I™m very close to, yes, to this day, yes. 

Q:     When is there the next ch
ange?  Is -- is it 
the war in 1939? 
A:     We ll, I mean before 1939, I went to Ca
mbridge, of course, I left Bootham, went  to 
Cambridge for two years, yeah. And then I di dn™t 
want to go to America, that™s the last place I 
want to go to. I -- only American I™ve ever me
t in Cambridge was crazy. And then my favorite 

hairdresser, in Chamoni x where my mother had a hous
e, just before I went, when I said to him, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
23 
 
ﬁI™m going to America.ﬂ He said, ﬁVous allez ch
ez les fous.ﬂ You know how
 that™s -- and we 
knew nothing about America, I mean it™s so typi
cal. Here was a big newspaper family, perhaps 
the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, 
had no American connections. None. The only 
relative we had in Amer ica was somebody who had 
-- who had slept with 
a truck driver in 1890, 
and was sent to America. That also
 I knew, yes, yeah. So, I me -- 

Q:     Why was America on the horizon? 

A:     We ll, where else were you going to go?  My 
father got a visa to America, was a rare thing. 

And I had to immi grate to America before I was 
21. I would never get a visa myself. There were 
long lines for this sort of thing, yeah. So, there wa
s a terrific row until I finally sa id -- and then I 
had a re-entry permit to come  back. And I went 
over here in the firs
t of August, 1939. Well, you 
know what happened subsequently. So I stayed. 

Q:     In Cambridge you studied history? 

A:     Yes, mm-hm. 
Q:     And was that because of this guy Gilbert? 
A:     I think he had a lot to do with it, comi ng 
to think of it, yes, but 
it was also the study of 

gentleme n. If you didn™t know it -- an -- anything el
se to study, and in Cambridge you stayed in 
the circle of the friends of your school. You we
nt to the college with which your s -- boarding 

school was affiliated, yes. And you had that ki nd of 
circle -- I had also ot her refugee friends, but 
you also had that kind of circle, and -- and if 
they didn™t know what to do, they either studied 
law, which I thought was impractical, cause I me  
-- could I rema in in Britain, there is a very 
good question, yeah. And so history seemed to be the best bridge until I knew what I was going 

to do, which I had no idea. 

Q:     So you come  to America in August? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
24 
 
A:     Yeah. 
Q:     Alone? 

A:     I come  to America alone, but 
I had a cousin who me
t me at the boat. 
Q:     This cousin? 

A:     No, no, th -- th -- we  haven™t talked about
 yet. She is a sa -- th
e daughter of one of my 
father™s sisters. She me t me  at the boat, she wa
s the only one. But you see, my sister would have 
met me, my sister came firstin 
19 thir -- ™36. And as my mother 
said, ﬁYou are giving us to the 
bombs.ﬂ You see?  But she, of course, had good se
nse, she came  [indecipherable] and she was in 
residence Schenectady, New Yor
k. Schenectady, New York was my first reference point in 
America. She was a resident of Schenectady in
 New York, yes. And I came to New York, and 
then my stepmother arrived, yes. And I hired an 
apartment for us, terr ible apartment for us, yes. 

And my father was caught in Fr
ance with my stepbrother, my 
stepmother™s son, yes. And he 
came out only with great difficulty, but he came 
out, too, eventually. And my mother came  out 
through the occupied zone of Fr
ance, from Switzerland, that you c
ould do, and my br other came  
out that way. But my sister was the first, yes. So 
I had my sister here, I vi
sit her, but that didn™t 
solve my problem, because August, you know, school 
starts in September, what am I going to 
do?  So what I did was fairly simple. Boot
ham was a Quaker school. I knew nothing about 

America, believe me , nothing. But I knew there wa
s a Quaker city called Philadelphia. So I 
looked up the trains and I just had enough money to 
come  to Philadelphia, that was all. We  were 
very poor, there was no money. I just had no mo ney. 
And in Philadelphia I went and got myself a  
taxi and said, ﬁDrive me  to the first Quaker in
stitution.ﬂ Which he did, which was Friends Select 
School. So I went in and said, ﬁI want to see the 
headma ster,ﬂ and I said 
to the headma ster, ﬁI™m 
an old Bootham boy, I have no mone y, first you must
 pay the taxi.ﬂ Which he did. Then I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
25 
 
ﬁNow it™s Se ptember, what am I going to do? ﬂ  
He said, ﬁWe have two colleges, the Quakers. 
Haverford and Swarthmore.ﬂ I said, ﬁ Where does 
the train go first?ﬂ Th
e trai n went fi rst to 
Haverford. So I got off at Have
rford station, walked to the co
llege, saw the president, William 
Wi star Comfort. And said, ﬁI™m an old B
ootham boy here am I stranded,ﬂ you know, ﬁI™m 
hungry.ﬂ I wa s hungry. And he said, ﬁ We™ll take th
ee.ﬂ Now, I don™t know, I was the first Jew 
ever accepted at Haverford I think. Yes, I™m sure, 
yes, and it was very ex
clusive ma inline college 
in those days, very, yes. So I 
went to Haverford. A lucky choice,
 because in those days small 
colleges could afford great scholars, and Ha
verford had great scholars. Was very good. 
Q:     Like who? 
A:     That™s when I really 
learned to study. We ll, the ma n whos
e assistant I was -- I majored in 
English, first, was Leslie hots -- Hodson, the 
ma n who discovered who™d killed Christopher 
Marlowe. He  was a great literary
 detective, which was very g
ood for my research skills. And 
then I wrote my honors thesis, which was quite 
long, under William Lunt, who -- who was a very 
prominent historian in those da
ys, English historian, of England, historian of England, yes. 
Q:     Now why did you go to -- into Englis
h, after you had been ma joring in history at 
Ca mbridge? 

A:     I don™t know, I wanted t
o. I do -- can™t tell you, yes. I ha
d enough of his -- I wanted to go 
into English. 

Q:     And what was it like for you amongst 
these students?  Being in America now, when you 
was -- 

A:     Oh no, oh no, Haverford was very accepting, it was really very good, yes. No, no, no, no. I 

-- I had no -- no problems at Haverford really. 
I ma de friends, you know, the faculty was very 
nice, and the -- see, some  were very distinguis
hed, and -- no, that -- th
at was quite different. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310

Q:     We re you very conscious at this point of
 -- was there a lot of reports you were getting and 
reading about what was going on in Europe?  Wa s th
is some thing that was of concern to you, or -- 
A:     Yes, we were all concerned, but I woul
dn™t say it was in the absolute forefront, no. There 
was too muc h else. Haverford was a very dema
nding place, you mustn™t fo
rget. Vacations were 
shorter than in England, much shorter. 
Q:     And where was -- wher
e were your f -- was your father 
and stepmother living, and where 
was your mother living after you 
-- after they came  here? 
A:     My mother went to Ju
an-les-Pins as I said, in France. 
Q:     No, no, no, tha -- she came here though, didn™t she? 

A:     Yeah, she di -- oh, my stepmot her, you me an?   

Q:     Yeah -- 

A:     Oh no, she lived with my father in Paris,
 they lived in Paris, unt
il they come to America -- 
oh no -- 
Q:     Oh, that™s what I -- 
A:     -- oh, you mean America. 

Q:     -- that™s what I asked. 

A:     No, what they did in America is very in
teresting, because that™s an
other story that needs to 
be written some time. They went to Be rkeley. All 
rich refugees went to Berkeley. In Berkeley 
you couldn™t get any work, there was no work, but 
it™s a beautiful climate, beautiful scenery, 

university, and library, cultivated conversation. 
So in Berkeley you will fi nd quite a gr oup of 
refugees, all of them more or less wealthy, you 
know, because afterwards the money came  back. 
More or less wealthy refugees, mm- h m.  

Q:     So, since your father 
has lost all of his business -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
27 
 
A:     Oh, let me  say, they didn™t go to Berkel
ey, cause Berkeley was too damp, they went to 
Orinda, behind the tunnel road. 
Q:     So what does your father do? 

A:     Nothing. 

Q:     Nothing. 

A:     No.  

Q:     And how do they survive?   

A:     Oh, there was money then. There was mone y because we  sold the Swiss business. I should 

have said that. When eventually they sold the 
Swiss business, and then there was mo ney, yeah. I 

mean, they didn™t live opulen
tly, but they lived well. 
Q:     Did it bother you to have -- 

A:     And my stepmother also then earned 
money by having, as you would say, a daycare center 
in her house. 
Q:     Did the change of money, not 
living the way you had in Europe bother you? 
A:     It™s very odd, very odd. No, 
it didn™t at all. And th
e two -- two -- two things that have to be 
said about that. First of all, it di dn™t bother me
 because in my boarding schools I™d already lived 
a Spartan life, so -- so what was new?  You see, 
that was excellent , yes. And secondly, because I 
felt already then, which I™ve become  convinced of 
since, that exile was my
 salvation, because if I 
just stayed in Germany, I would just have been
 a spoiled brat, another 
spoiled brat, and nothing 
would ever have become of me , I™m sure. So I ha
d a -- I mean, I say that exile and all this, that 
was my own personal salvation. It™s not the usual 
view of exile, of course, but I have known 
other people who w
ill say that, too.  
Q:     Did it give you other kinds of in
sights, or o-other -- 
other kinds of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
28 
 
A:     Yes, well, exile was very important, of c
ourse. It -- I think it made me -- let me say, very -- 
well, it made me like rootlessness. It made me 
sympathize with what the Germans used to call, 
you know, free floating intellectuals. You know, as an
 historian, it gave me  
a vision that wasn™t 
so prejudiced, ‚cause I am -- really wasn™t root
ed anywhere. So I came to terms with it, yes.  
Q:     Ru -- ruthlessne -- rootlessness -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- is often a frightening thing for most people. 

A:     Yeah, no, for me  I think it was a good thing.
 It was not fr ightening for me  at all. That™s 

because I™d always been rootless. Look, I was fi
rst in the German boarding school, then in the 
English boarding school, then in Cambridge. Those were my  environments. The home was not 

an environment. I really didn™t have a home in th
e classical sense, very much. I mean, from the 
time I was 15, and even before, it wasn™t a -- 
a home y home, and -- as
 you think of, you know. 
For example, now when I come back now -- I me an
 now that the German -- East Germany is -- is 
done for, I -- I went back, of course, to see wh
ere I spent most of my 
ti me on vacation before I 
was 15, at our estate in Schenkendorf, yes, y
eah. And I saw the castle 
and all that. I had no 
sentimental feelings at all, it™s 
very odd. Now, it™s sold, it™s gone
, and I wasn™t at all sentimental 
about it. Though, in the village, where it ‚tis 
-- Sc henkendorf village -- my parents gave the 
church bells. And one is name d after me , and one 
after my sister, and I™m 
happy to say my sister 
was me lted down in the war, but I 
still ring over the village, yes. 
All the time . I went, at great 
danger to life and limb up to the tower to see that 
darn bell. And it still rings, I can tell you, yeah. 
Q:     Okay. That™s a good place to stop.

Tape One, Side B 
Q:     George, before we go on with your getting your Ph.D. -- 
A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- tell me -- tell us a li
ttle about your sister, and what she 
did, and the clinic
 that she set up 
in Harlem. 

A:     My sister was a psychiatrist, who was ve
ry much interested in -- in social problems, and 

her specialty was reading disorders. She ev
entually wrote a two volume book on reading 
disorders in children, yes. But she set up -- it mus t  have been in the late 40™s, a -- a psychiatric 

clinic in Harl em, which was fr ee, yes, the fi rst 
one in Harlem, free, in the baseme nt of Ada m 
Clayton Powell™s church. And sh
e called it the La Farge Clinic
. You know, La Farge was Karl 
Marx™s west Indian son-in-law, but nobody to this
 day knows what that means, they think it™s a 
donor. Oh well. Yes. And that ran for -- I don™t k
now -- she set it up with another psychiatrist 

called We rtheim, whose  also quite famous, yes. 
She and We rtheim set it up together, but she was 
really the force behind this. And -- and then ev
entually it™s discon -- 
it was discontinued, there 
was no more need for it, I guess, others came. 
And now the papers and all this are in the 
Schomburg library, Black Hist
ory Library in New York. 
Q:     Let™s get back to you. 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     You graduate from Haverford, and you ha
ve to ma ke -- when did you ma ke the decision to 
go on to graduate school and get -- 

A:     Oh that, imme diately. Yeah, once I studie
d history at Haverford -- 
I me an, I was an English 
ma jor first, but then I switched to history ma jor.
 Then -- immediately -- and I first want to go to 
Yale, yes. But then I went to Harvard because
 I discovered so mething in the Harvar d catalog -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
30 
 
one has to read college ca talogs. Ther e is in 
Harvard a fellowship called the Holzer Fe llowship, 
which is for those who were born in Berlin Ch
arlottenburg, which is a 
suburb -- no, it™s not a 
suburb, it™s a part of Berlin. And I had to prove 
that the street, the house 
-- my street was part 
Berlin, part Berlin Charlottenburg. And I had to
 prove I was born in Berlin Charlottenburg. 

When I proved that, I had three years tuition a
nd everything, cause no -- 
there were no other 
candidates who in that time  was bor
n in Berlin Charlottenburg. It pa
ys to read college catalogs is 
the answer. So -- but I we nt to Harvard because  there was a pr ofessor I wa nt to study with, 

Charles Howard McIlwain. I was interest ed then
 in English Constitutional hist ory, yes. And I 
wrote my thesis on English Constitutional history.
 That was really my field, yes, my i nterest. 
And that came  about because really
 very little else was taught to 
begi n with i-in -- in school, in 
any case. And I -- through Leslie Gilbert and ot
hers, I had become  deeply involved in English 
history. So that™s why. And then I di d my thesis
 with a wonderful ma n, a great teacher, Charles 
Howard McIlwain at Harvard.  
Q:     Now, you didn™t -- before you finished 
your degree, you actually 
started teaching in -- 
A:     Yes, that was necessary. I -- I wr ote, I 
think, a hundred letters, and got two offers. It was 
very tough after the war, one forgets, it™s not ju
st now. Got two offers, one from NYU, and one 
from Iowa. And I took the one from Iowa -- fr
om Iowa. And was an offer, I think 16 hours 
teaching at $1,800, or some thing like that. But you could ma ke a living, ye s. And of course I™d 
never been in the Midwest, and I™ll never forg
et arriving in Iowa Cit
y, four in the mor ning, 
‚cause that™s when the Rock Island Rocket, the 
train gets through there, yes, and going to the 
ma in street, and the ma in street is, as I now know
 in the Midwest, just tapers off into nothing. I 
started to cry. The ma in street tape
red off into nothing, there was nothing. 

Q:     Did you regret the choice then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
31 
 
A:     No, no, no, because Iowa had a wonderful th
ing in those days, absolutely unique. It had a 
dean who was a genius in his way. He said, ﬁNow
 look, we are a university that™s poor, what can 
we really be good in? ﬂ  Fi ne arts. So it had an 
art departme nt which was top, top. I still have in 
my house pictures by painters who are now fa mo
us, ‚cause whenever you gave a party and a 
painter broke an ashtray, he ga
ve you a picture, you know, pre
tty good. You put the ashtrays in 
their way. So -- and it had a theater that was fant
astic, British direct ors,
 and actors, someti mes 
Hermione Gingold, and I don™t know wh
at, really absolutely superb, 
art history superb, yes. And 
history was good too, it was a univers
ity in the up. But the wonderful
 thing -- and I was a cultural 
historian, don™t forget-- the wonderf
ul thing was the whole fine ar
ts scene. There was there the 
fa mous writer™s workshop, which still exists, yes. So
 my colleague for three -- I was there ni -- 
eight years, and eight or
 nine years. For four of these year
s, Robert Lowell, the poet, was my 
colleague, yes. And his wife, Elizabeth Hardwic
k. Yes. So, I me an Iowa was quite a special 
place, believe me. 
Q:     Now, you said you were 
-- you were a cultural historian. 
A:     Yeah. 
Q:     But when you graduate 
from Harvard, that™s not the -- 
A:     No, that™s not it, it shifted. I mean, I 
was still doing English Constitutional history, but 
more and more interested in cult
ural ma tters. This is quite true. 
Q:     Is there some  reason it come s a
bout, or simply that you start teaching? 

A:     No, it™s simply I -- I 
taught -- I taught Ren and Ref, Renaissance and Refor mation, and I 
taught English Constitutional hist ory, of cour
se, yes. And sometimes modern Britain, it 
depended, yes. And I always taught the freshman 
course, that was my gr eat plus. I learned to 
teach first in the war, when I was a pa rt of 
the program which trained occupation troops. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
32 
 
had one regime nt that was to occupy Czechoslo
vakia, and one that o
ccupied France. And the 
boys in the Czechosl -- in the one that was to
 occupy Czechoslovakia were very nice. But the 
ones who were to occupied France gave me  gr
eat deal of pressure, 
‚cause I thought France 
probably deserved them. They were all Marxists, 
all from Ne w York City, most of them. So you 
can imagine, I had to teach them, my  first teachin
g, that was a challenge. That™s how I learne d to 
teach, I™m very grateful for that, it 
really -- it really was a challenge. 
Q:     Where were you doing this teaching? 
A:     In Iowa city already. 

Q:     Oh, that -- that™s where -- 

A:     That program was in Iowa 
city. I just stayed in Iowa city. 
Q:     So what did you ha ve to teach them?  

A:     How to occupy the countries, with the 
-- the topography, almost everything. They were all 
sent to Japan, of course, in the end, the army being the army, yes. 
Q:     You like teaching. 
A:     Yes, very much, mm-hm. We ll, I became 
very good at lecturing, ‚cause then the ve terans 
came, and we had classes of, let™s say up to a 
thousand. And I was the only person in my whole 
departme nt who could lecture to 
a thousand. It takes a certain show
ma nship, yes. And that I used 
to get imme diate promotion to tenure, of course. 
I reme mber I me t the dean on the staircase and I 
said, ﬁWell, I think I have enough, I™ll leave.ﬂ ﬁO
h no, you mustn™t do that,ﬂ he said. Then I gave 
my conditions. But I was the only one who could lectur e to that ma ny people. 

Q:     What kind of research di
d you start to -- start to
 do at --  at this time in the late 40™s and 
early 50™s?  Were you moving towards -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
33 
 
A:     No, not yet, this was all red -- Renai
ssance and Refor mation research, yes, mm-hm. I did 
then -- I began in the mi d-50™s to do some on 
antisemi -- one on anti-Semitism, German anti-
Semitism. I wrote an ar ticle, I don™t know, ™58 
or some thing like that. That was my fi rst. 
Q:     And what did -- what -- the impetu
s, is there any par
ticular reason why you -- 
A:     No, I can™t really tell you. We ll, there wa
s a particular reason, yes.
 Wisconsin gave me  an 
offer, and I wanted to come  to Wi sconsin, ‚cause
 it was then one of the 
best history departme nts 
in the country. And the condition wa
s that I teach modern cultural 
history. So I had to work it up, 
I never had a course in modern 
history in my life. So I had to work it up, obviously, yes. So 
that™s -- that™s how it came .  

Q:     Is there some thing in -- in that beginni
ng study that also goes back to your history -- I mean, 
clearly it goes back in -- in simple parallel
s. You went through some  of that, your family -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- goes through some  of that, but -- but -- 
A:     Oh yes. 
Q:     -- is there some thing in
 that that drives you as well? 
A:     Yes, well to understand, of course, what
 happened, yes. To understand what happened, and 
what had gone -- could have gone so wrong, or the 
position of the Jews, and thing -- matters of 

this nature. You see, I starte
d out, I should say, my Ren and 
re -- Ref research was heavily 
weighted on the Reformation, and on Christian 
theology, yes. I™d studied Christian theology, I™d 
even lived for a short time in a kind of monas -- 
monastic Christian establishment. I knew how to 
serve ma ss. Greatly astonished my Hebrew -- when
 I first came to the He
brew university in ™69, 
they asked me  to teach the Reforma tion. So I sa
id, how can I teach the Refor mation to kids who 
doesn™t know what -- who don™t know what the ma ss 
is. So I arranged with the -- I had some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
34 
 
connections with -- with Our La
dies of Zion, to let me  celebrate a ma ss for them, and I did. 
Showed them exactly what™s happening, what™s 
what, what what. The ladies were impressed. 
The students, I don™t know. Anyhow, so I was -- 
I was really into the Christian theology 
[indecipherable] and then in the Baroque, which goe
s directly to my interest, you know, in Nazi 
liturgy and things, which is -- comes after, in a sense, from the Baroque, yes. I had continued to 

publish on early modern till ™68 -- till ™70 really, 
cause one thing I wrote in -- in ™60, came  out 
only in ™70.  

Q:     But in the early 60™s is 
when you started publishing more -- 
A:     Al most exclusively except for the textbook, Europe in the 16
th
 Century, which came  out in 
™68. 

Q:     When you came to this country, you clearl
y must have noticed the racism against blacks, 
African-America ns. Did that -- was that some thing -- 

A:     No, what astonished us was the racism
 against Jews, not against blacks. We  knew nothing 
about blacks, we™d hardly ever seen a black, qu
ite apart from met a blac
k. But I reme mber, we 
went it -- in -- in a trav
el agency and wanted to go some wher
e, and the travel agents sa ys, ﬁYou 
can™t, it™s restricted.ﬂ And we
 said, ﬁWhy did we  leave Germa
ny at all? ﬂ That was common, you 
know, there were lots of resorts th
at were restricted for Jews, yes,
 yes. Yes, of course. And I was 
rejected from Columbia graduate school, becausethe Jewish quota was full. In fact, I have the 

rejection, it says it.  

Q:     It says it? 

A:     Yeah, mm-hm. So, and -- 
third -- third evid
ence, when I left Harvard for my first job, my 
ma jor professor, who was not an anti-Semite, he 
was a wonderful ma n, had to write on my letter 
of recomme ndation, which is secret, but I promptly 
read it when I got ther
e, of course, ﬁGeorge 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
35 
 
Mosse has good ma nners, though he is a Jew.ﬂ And 
I think I got my job, I was always the first 
Jew. I was the first Jew in Iowa depa rtme nt, I wa
s the fi rst Jew in the Wi sconsin department. But 
what kosherized me , of course, my
 English education in Cambridge. 
Q:     Was it -- was it -- 

A:     Th -- if instead I had been -- I had been
 educated in the Bronx in 
City College, I don™t think 
it would have been the same. 

Q:     Was it difficult at Harvard?
 Did you experience anti-Semitism there? 

A:     No, no, none. No. 

Q:     We re there ma ny Jewi
sh professors at Harvard? 
A:     I never gave it much thought. There were
 some  who wer e  quite 
spectacular. Levine, who 
just died, in English. Not ma ny. Very few, very fe
w. We ll, above all, in my  subject, these were 
taboo subjects, English and hist
ory, there was hardly any. 
Q:     Hardly any Jews at the time . 
A:     Yeah, hardly any. In America, hardly
 any. No, these were as 
good as closed subjects. 
Q:     How do you -- how do you characterize th-t
h-the questions that you™re really asking, once 
you start studying racism, National Soci
alism, a nd fascism, and -- and -- 
A:     I don™t quite know what you mean by characterize. 
Q:     Some times people say that
 -- that -- that  scholars have on
e question they™re 
really asking all 
the time, and they ask it in different -- 

A:     No, my question is usually why 
did -- why was it popular, why™d it succeed, what do 

people see in it, yes. Yeah. I look at it from it™s 
effect, let™s put it that 
way. What was the effect?  
What was the mi ndset, you know. 

Q:     Do you understand it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
36 
 
A:     Yes, I think I understand it pretty well. At
 least to my s a tisfaction. 
Maybe not to others, but 
to my satisfaction, yes, mm-hm. 
Q:     Can you -- can you give us some -- I mean, 
I know that it™s five -- it™s 10 books, but if you 
would start to explain in -- in some  sort -- 

A:     We ll, there are alwa ys two things, I mea
n, it™s an interaction betw
een the actual situation, 
yes, and then to see the conditioni
ng of the thought, yes. They inte
ract, and of course the actual 
situation before ™33 was pretty mi serable, ye
s. And Hitler had imme di
ate successes, you know, 
with unemployment, so that™s one thing. And the 
other thing is, I think, in such a situation, and 

that™s nothing new, people want certain things. 
They want security. They want shelter. They 
want to -- self affir mation. All that sort of th
ing. And if you really list 
all these things, you will 
find that fasc ism took care of it, you know. I mean, H
itler said it best , let th
e little me rchant who 
is lonely in his shop, when he come s out to a 
ma ss meetings, suddenly finds himself, as it were, 
among comr ades. He suddenly fi
nds what he mi sses, yes.  
Q:     But there™s -- but 
there™s -- I know you don™t like
 the term totalitarianism. 
A:     Yeah, yeah. 

Q:     But in the context of what it 
was that  the Nazis cr eated in Germany -- 
A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- as we ll as the possibility 
for that kind of home , so to speak -- 
A:     Yeah, yeah. 

Q:     -- within the context of this society. There™s also the constant
 threat that you will be seen as 

an enemy, or you can be possibly 
taken out. Or is that the -- 
A:     Yeah, not really. I mea
n, not really. Not if you confor m.  
And of course there were those 
who didn™t like it, who thought they could be out
side it, but there was a consensus. Fascism 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
37 
 
could use the consensus in Germany and Italy, 
and it produced a consensus where mos t  people 
wanted to confor m. They wanted that heady feeling of being in a group of comr ades, if you like, 
yes. Of doing some thing, ma rching, demonstrating,all of this. They wanted strong leadership, 

yes. They wanted to know where they are goi
ng, and they wanted to know where they came 
from, and the -- the -- the 
Nazis did all of this.  
Q:     How would you descri
be the differences between Italian fascism and the National 
Socialism in Germany? 

A:     We ll, the differences are quite consider
able, I think, on one level.
 Mussolini™s regime  was 
more open, let™s say different th
ings went into it unknown in Ge
rmany. The futurist moveme nt, 
with it™s idea of speed and dyna
mi c, and all of this, yes. Andof course, Italian nationalism was 
kind of a -- always had a revolutiona
ry edge to it, th -- one that 
Mussolini adopted, yes. While in 
Germany, you have a much more dense space, ro
manticism, racism; racism unknown in Italy, 
there™s no racist tradition. Italy hardly has an 
anti-Semitic tradition. So that deprives it, already, 
of a lot of things that you asso
ciat e with the Nazi s, yes. But a lot of things are the same, the 
control of thought -- well, there™s 
another great difference. Mussolini didn™t care about culture. 
You could have the most -- after all, the most 
mo dernist buildings in Europe were built under 
fascism. Like the House of Fascism i n Modena, 
probably the most modernist building in Europe 
of it™s time , yes. There was no -- no official art in
 Ital y till very late. It  
did come , but very late, 
yes. All of that. There wa s no -- so severe book ce
nsorship as in Germany. In other words, the 
culture, which didn™t interest Mussoli -- Mussolini, or
 did interest him, but he had a more open -- 
he was quite a different person, he had a more 
open mi nd on this, yes. Otherwise, it was a 
dictatorship. These are the differences. 

Q:     Did you travel to Italy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
38 
 
A:     Oh, yes. 
Q:     During the w -- 

A:     In the 30™s. 

Q:     30™s.  

A:     Mm-hm. 

Q:     Where did you go and what did you do? 

A:     We ll, my mother took me  to Florence, 
that™s what Germans did. And that was the Italian 
city, yes. So I -- were very heady, I looked at Fl
orence for the first time . But while we were in 
Florence in ™36, the axis between 
Hitler and Mussolini was signed, 
and part of the axis was an 
extradition treaty, under which we could fall. But 
Mussolini, in about 1921 
-- ™20 - ™21, before he 
became prime mi nister, made the rounds of all 
the newspaper publishers, yes, important ones, 
also my father, and my father supported him, I 
mean, not for Germany, but for Italy it was fine, it 
ma de the train run on time, and so on, yes. A
nd that Mussolini and in fact, showed hims elf 
grateful by letting me and my moth
er s-stay in Italy as long as 
we liked, and simply ignored the 
extradition treaty. 

Q:     George, in the 50™s -- through a good part 
of the 60™s, it™s probably still true today, but 
certainly in the 50™s, there™s repetition of ﬁRed Scareﬂ. 

A:     Yes. 

Q:     And McCarthyism is very strong. 

A:     Yes, yes. Yeah. 

Q:     You are -- what -- what is happening to
 you during this period?  
What™s [indecipherable] 
activity? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
39 
 
A:     Oh, I was very active during this period. 
First of all, I was vice-chairma n of the Wa llace 
campaign, Henry Wallace, not the other, Henry 
Wallace campaign in Iowa, in ™48, ye s, yeah. 
And that™s another speaking, I learned to speak cause I spoke at county fairs, and so on, that was 
very good. So -- in the Wallace campaign, yes. A
nd then I became chairman of the American 
Association University Professors
, but in Iowa it was quite diffe
rent. There, McCarthy was the 

radical. For example, I made a big meeting, as 
chairman, anti-McCarthyite meeting, overtly, with 
the finance chairman of the Republican party of
 Iowa as the ma in speaker. You see, for him 
McCarthy wa s the radical, yes. And indeed, when
 singing cowboy Senator Taylor -- you™re too 
young to know all this -- who was Henry Wa llace™
s vice-presidential candidate, you know, he 
came and strummed; he was senator from Idaho. Id
aho is greatly changed in politics since then. 
He was -- the senator from Ida
ho came  to my house. This wa
s risky because I was just an 
assist ant pr ofessor without tenure, but the pr esident himself called me and said, ﬁThat™s fi ne, 

George, do go ahead.ﬂ Yeah. And our Republican 
state rep -- our Republi
can representative 
came to the house too at that point, to say he
llo to the senators. No, no, in Iowa you were 
protected by the -- by the cons
ervatism against McCarthyism.  
Q:     Did you teach Marxism?  

A:     Yes, always. 

Q:     Wa s that a problem? 

A:     Never. Never. 

Q:     But now professors in the east had problems during the 60™s. 

A:     Ah, yes, and I nearly had problems , 
because -- and that™s another good e-example what 
happened. In Harvard, Marxism wasn™t taught, so t
ogether with ma ny other of my friends, I went 
over to MIT to Dirk Struik to study Marxism. A
nd then all people in Dirk Struik™s semi nar were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
40 
 
denounced to the Chicago Tribune, no less, by whom?  The former Librarian of Congress. The 
historian -- what™s he called?  I fo
rgot now. I even blocked on his name . Well, the one before this 
one, a Nixon appointee. Yeah, histor ian. We ll, h-he 
-- became later, he denounced it, yes. But he 

didn™t denounce me , he stopped before me , that was very ticklish, so I never had to face that. But 

because this denunciation came, and brought people
 at Rutgers and otherwise into terrible 
difficulty, again told our dean, you know, I™m about
 to be denounced to be a Marxist, but he 
says, ﬁDon™t worry.ﬂ I would -- you know, I think 
I would have been saved because of the 

conservatism. But not at Rutgers, not -- not in 
all these eastern placeswhere the others taught, 
who™d been with me  in Dirk Struik™s Marxism c l ass. 

Q:     That™s interesting. When did the racism
 in the United States for you become  a conscious 
problem?  

A:     We ll, as I said, when my mother and I 
spoke to that  travel agent, but then it became 
conscious that there was, in 
fact, anti-Jewish racism around. 
Q:     No, but in the 60™s, you -- you -- in -- in -- in ™56 -- 

A:     Oh, the Civil Rights move me nt. 

Q:     The Civil Rights moveme nt [indecipherable] 

A:     Yes, well that was di
fferent, I mean, then well -- knew
 -- everybody knew and so ma ny of 
my students went on freedom rides,
 very close friends of mi ne 
went on freedom rides, and so 
that was totally different. 

Q:     We re there ma ny black students at University of Iowa? 

A:     No, that™s before that, before the 
bl -- influx of black students, yes, before. 
Q:     When do you go to 
University of Wi sconsin? 
A:     ™56.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
41 
 
Q:     And how long were you at the Univ
ersity of Wi sconsin?  Until [indecipherable] 
A:     Till I retired, till ™88. Bu
t from ™69 to ™88, only half tim
e. I mean, I™m sorry. I came  to 
Wi sconsin already getting every other seme ster 
off. That I used from ™69 on to teach in 
Jerusalem, but I got my chair in Jerusalem, regul
ar chair in Jerusalem in ™78. And from then I 
went on half time in Wi sconsin. It dovetailed
 very nicely the way 
semesters were then. 
Q:     Now what is the Jerusalem connection? 
The connection with Israel
 that you™re going back 
and forth, and so early -- 

A:     We ll, it™s a funny connection, because 
you know, all my youth, I was an anti-Zionist, I was 
an anti-Zioni st even into the war, yes. Becau
se I thought defeating Hi
tler came first, and the 
Zionist agenda a far second, ye
s, yeah. And then I suppose I changed when I saw what was 
happening, and -- and I ma de my first 
visit to jerus -- to Israel in ™
51, yes, as a tourist. And then I 
came back in ™61, and then I had already, from 
a very good friend of mi ne
, the Marxist -- the -- I 
mean, the scholar of Marxism, George Lichth
eim,  very good rec -- letters of recomme ndation, 
yeah. And I met all the people there, the -- 
the historian Talmon, but above all Gershem 
Scholem, to whom I was  going to be quite close in
 a way, if one could be close to Scholem, was 
-- couldn™t really. But, you know, 
who I got to know very well in 
the end, and all this, if you like 
ﬁyekkeﬂ German Jewish circle there, yes. And one 
thing led to another, a
nd I gave some  lectures 
in ™63, and then in ™68 they asked me  to come  
for a seme ster, which I did. And then they ma de 
me  what they called ﬁperma nent visiting professo
rﬂ. ‚Course, they didn™t like, even when I came 
in ™78, they didn™t like anybody -- 
they were -- they™re very o
dd, the Hebrew [indecipherable] 
very provincial in many -- in this way, they di
dn™t like somebody teaching other pl aces than the 

Hebrew University. Now how could I do it ™78?  
Because I got the Koebner chair. Koebner was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
42 
 
the first professor of history th
ere, yes?  And I think the German
s who gave the money insisted 
that some body respectable come  on that chair.  
Q:     We re you any part of the discussions
 prior to the state being formed in ™48 -- 
A:     No. 

Q:     -- against the -- the [indecipherable]  

A:     No. 

Q:     [indecipherable] Magnes and Arendt– 

A:     No, no, no, no. I know now, and I™ve writ ten about it. No, no, I know all these people. 

Robert We lsch became a very close friend of mi ne, 
but that™s all long after.
 It™s all long after. 
Q:     So are you a Zionist now, or di
d you become  one in ™51 in some  sens e? 
A:     I suppose so. Yes, yes, no -- I m
ean, look, it™s not so simple, because you can™t 
[indecipherable] in one -- yes, I™
m an Utopian Zionist. I still th
ink it should be otherwise than 
just another little Albania there, or whatever
 you have, yes, yeah. Yeah. And I know very well 
what the possibilities in Zioni
sm were. Na me ly, a huma nized nationalism, you know, with Buber 
and ma ny ot hers. Gordon, and founder of the 
Kibbutz move ment. It could have been a 
huma nized nationalism, perhaps still is
 in a way, yes. Yes, I suppose I am. 
Q:     Talk about that. What do you 
mean by huma nized nationalism, be cau -- 
A:     People who wanted nationalism, open cosmopolitan nationalism, for whom nationalism 
was me rely a stage of your ow
n self growth, you know. As for Buber, as for Gordon, it™s post-

German and eastern European, that 
exists, and that still 
exists today, a very 
strong current, anti-
war, you know, and all of this. It still exists. I mea
n, it™s very difficult to think of another country 
where you could have anti-war demo nstration the mi
ddle of a war for surviv
al. But you have it in 
Israel. So these currents ar
e still there, yes. No, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
43 
 
Q:     ‚Cause most people think of Zionism as a -- as a monolithic -- 
A:     Oh, it™s far from monolithic, it™s far fr
om monolithic. No. No, no, I feel very mu ch at home 
in Jerusalem, and should by now, you know. And 
I have ma ny, ma ny friends there, probably 
more than any other place. But -- and there™s 
mu ch more inters -- interest ing intellect ual 
discussion there than here, yeah. Because obviou
sly, when you are in an extreme situation, the 
discussion is more pressing, more 
-- more interesting, yes, more fr
uitful, than when you™re just 
with nothing. I mean, I know Ameri
cans try to invent enemies when 
they can, but in Israel it™s 
real. 

Q:     Do you think that™s true, 
that -- that intellectual life is --
 is more creative when -- when 
there™ s --  

A:     Yes, yes. 

Q:     -- a sense of -- 

A:     Yes, I think it™s true. But in Israel I mu
st say -- I™m not talking a
bout the average Israeli, I 
move in Israel very rarified circles, yeah. 
The German Jewish circle is dying out. But the young 
people, ma ny of them I™ ve taught in one way or
 another, it™s very exciting, very good, you know. 
And there is something about it, about thes
e young people even, that™s cosmopolitan, you know, 
I mean, you know. I mean, they also talk about Eu
rope, not just about Is
rael, you know, and that 
sort of thing. 

Q:     Are there particular issues in history th
at -- that are very importa
nt to these students, I 
mean, can -- can one in some  sense -- 

A:     No, I don™t think so, no. Of course, in th
e Jewish history course, 
they all wait for the 
Holocaust, ‚cause that™s the most spectacular. Wh
ich is a pity, because Jewish histor y is not 
about the Holocaust, there are also ma ny other things. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
44 
 
Q:     But it™s spectacular for this century. 
A:     Yes. And that™s a pity, be
cause they -- they -- it blinds them
 to other Jewish things in this 
century, which have, perhaps, great inte
llectua l va lue, or carry -- whatever. 
Q:     What do you think it mi ght blind people to
, when -- when the Holocaust is overemphasized 
like that? 

A:     It blinds them for one thing to the irony 
of Jewish history that the Holocaust takes place at 
the precise moment when you have 
the greatest success of assimila
tion in history, namely in the 
United States. And it blinds them to the fact of th
e success of assimilation, rather  than the failure. 
Q:     That™s 
very significant. 

A:     Yes, it™s very significant. 

Q:     I suppose it™s hard to
 take both at the same time. 
A:     It™s hard for people to th
ink dialectically, which is what you 
have to do in these cases, yes. 
The negative -- the positive is in 
dialectic relationship, but I thi
nk it™s undoubtedly true, yes. And 
then it blinds you what is the consequence of 
the Holocaust, I mean people ask me , what is a 
historical consequence of the Holocaust.
 Has it stopped ma ss acres? No. You think so? 
Q:     No. 

A:     No. Has it stopped genocide?  Pr obably not.
 Yeah?  Has it -- it has 
done some thing to the 
situation of the Jews. It has ma de, in a wa
y, assimilation easier, because, you know, people don™t 
want to repeat it, people don™t want
 to come  into contact with it. 
Certainly in central Europe, yes. 
Not so much in countries which are distant from t he Holocaust, but wherever the Holocaust had 

an impact. It™s in ham -- impact on the status of
 the Jews. I think there™s no doubt about that. And 
above all it has created Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
45 
 
Q:     Is there also an irony to -- I-I don™t know if
 ﬁironyﬂ is the right word, 
but that -- there is at 
the same  a kind of sensitivity about anti-Semitismthat didn™t exist prior to the Holocaust, even 
though there is at the same  ti me , even Christ
ian -- a -- a very di
fferent relationship -- 
A:     Yes, yes, yes. 

Q:     -- Christians have with Jews. 

A:     Yes, I think that™s true, but only to so
me  extent. I mean you can™t -- one can™t make blanket 
statements about that. I doubt that on the averag
e this has ma de much diffe r ence. It has ma de 
difference to certain Christian th
eologians and Christian thinkers, 
and perhaps even to Christian 
churches, yes. Not to all of them, but to wu -- to
 the ma instream Christian churches, yes, yes, I 
think it has, mm-hm. 

Q:     George, you don™t teach the Holocaust, I gather. You -- this is
 not [indecipherabl e] 

A:     We ll, only in a general Jewish history course.  

Q:     And your scholarship -- 
A:     No. 
Q:     -- stops before [indecipherable] 

A:     Yes, yes. 

Q:     -- whatever it is. 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     Why -- why -- 

A:     Before the -- before the killing process. 

Q:     Before the killing process. Why? 

A:     Because I think the -- to me it™s much mo
re interesting to say why it happened than how it 
happened. After all, to me the decisive thing 
is why did it happen. Once -- how it happened, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
46 
 
that™s, I would say, an admi nistrative ma tter. Ve
ry interesting and fine
, and necessary to know, 
but the crucial question is w
hy did it happen. That™s why. 
Q:     But let me  ask you some thing. If you don™t 
investigate -- and I™m not
 talking about the how 
now. 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     But if you don™t investigate who it was th
at was doing the killing, or
 the process in some  
way -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- how do you bring together what you st udied prior, the -- the 
why that brought you up to 
t h e  mo me n t  - -  

A:     Yeah, yeah.  

Q:     -- of doing it, and -- and explain it, you -- 

A:     But you see, I do, because when I lecture,as I did just yesterday, on the first World Wa r or 
the Holocaust, that ™s exactly what
 I do. I explain the mi ndset of the perpetrators, which seems to 
me  essential, and the atmosphere in which they
 grew up, which has to do
 with the first World 
War, in which even ma ny of them fought. So th
ere is a continuity here
 in the mi nds of the 
perpetrators. How they regarded ma ss death, caus
e the Holocaust is about mass death. So is the 
first World War. So, how they regarded ma ss de ath, 
and so on. And there is a definite continuity 
there. Without a certain atmosphere
 in post-war germ -- post World War 
1
 Germany, it would 
have been quite different. Would ha ve been 
quite different. These we
ren™t youngsters who did 
the killing process, I me an. Maybe they hadn™t 
fought in the war, but they knew enough about 
the war, and certainly about post-war Germany, 
t he Weimar Republic, and 
all that. So again, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
47 
 
don™t think you can explain their 
motivation without going back. A
nd then one thing brings you 
to another. You see what I mean? 
Q:     Yeah, sort of a treat. 

A:     What? 

Q:     Let me  ask you -- let me  ask you about Hannah Arendt for a mo me nt .  

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     You™re one of the few scholars who, 
when her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, came out -- 
A:     Yes. 

Q:     -- did not just
 simply criticize it. 
A:     That™s right. 

Q:     What was she saying in th
ere that you thought was important? 
A:     Everything she said about Eichma nn I 
thought was true. I thought nothing she said about 
the Jews was actually true, but everything she said
 about Eichma nn was true. There is a banality 
of evil, because Eichma nn™s evil is ordinary, 
yeah. He was an ordinary ma n. To hi m, it was 
ordinary, yeah. So the question is, when does evil 
become  an ordinary thing. That™s, after all, the 
vital thing, and that sh
e addressed there, very well. When
 does evil s -- become  an ordinary 
thing, almos t  an everyday thing?  Infect ordina
ry people like -- like Eichma nn, yeah. That, I 
thought, was very well taken. But now, part of what
 she meant by the banality of evil, was that 

the perpetrator was thoughtless. 

A:     Was what? 

Q:     Thoughtless.  

A:     No -- yeah. 

Q:     Wa s not -- was not actually -- was not
 carrying on a Socratic dialog with hims elf -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
48 
 
A:     No, of course not. 
Q:     [indecipherable] question. 

A:     No, of course not, and she™s quite righ
t, no. It was doing your duty, that™s not a dialog, yes. 
ﬁBeing at the battlefront of 
the race warﬂ -- I™m quoting a perpetrator now Œ ﬁbeing at the 
battlefront of the race wa rﬂ. That doesn™t allow fo
r dialog, no more than you can have a dialog in 
the trenches. 

Q:     But at the same  time,
 orders are not given for everyt
hing. People ma ke up things to do. 
A:     Yeah, because you have to do what you have
 to do in or der to have the result, which is an 

order.  

Q:     So is Hilberg right, that some how the pe
rpetrators had a sense of what the orde r was, even 
if there™s no direct -- 

A:     Oh yes, I think on this he™s
 totally right, yes, for sure. Sure. 

Q:     So as a mi ssed -- a -- a -- 
A:     We ll, but they -- they had the order di
rectly from Hi mmler, I mean, you know, there™s no -- 
no question about that. They just 
didn™t go in there and start k
illing on -- on a hunch that that 
mi ght please the Fuehrer, mi ght please him. They
 had a direct order from Hi mmler, do it. And 
the Einsatztruppen ma de a 
direct order, so -- 
Q:     Have you ever talked with
 perpetrators, Nazi perpetrators? 
A:     Oh ye -- no, I interviewed a lot of Nazis, 
but what I interviewed -- what we call in German 
ﬁschreibpischtaeterﬂ- what do you ca
ll it, theoretical, I mean -- fo
r example, I™ve interviewed -- I 
was -- I knew Speer quite well, yes. I talked a lot 
with Speer, and I went and participated in what 
was left of the SA cultural circle, yeah, which wa
s quite interesting, yes. 
And si -- you know, I t -
- I talked to Mathilde Leudendorf. I talked a 
lot when I was writing, The Crisis of German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
49 
 
Ideology, and then I was writing a book called, The 
Nationalization of the Masses, which is ve ry 
largely based on Speer™s me mory of
 -- of certain ma tters. So, yes, 
I™ve interviewed a lot of Nazis, 
and what I do there is very simple, with suc
cess. I -- when I first me t Speer, he was very 
suspicious, of course. And I said, ﬁLook, look, I™m 
not interested in yourmorals. That™s between 
you and God. I™ve come  to ask you technical ques
tion.ﬂ So I asked him, why do you use this 
lighting effect at the Nuremberg trials, why do 
you do this?  And with that, he thought these were 
questions he could answer, techni
cal quest -- and then we went 
from technical to other things, 
and it worked, I think, very well. 

Q:     What was it like -- 

A:     I got everything out of him -- what?  He got
 me  -- he always picked me  up in M unich -- you 
know, this at -- this went over about fi ve, six years.
 He always picked me  up in Munich in a car, 
which had a Wankel mot or, that was the -- the -- th
e -- the alternative to 
our engine, yes, our -- 
yes, our motor engine, and that he developed in
 the war, yeah, yes. And off we went. And the 
embarrassing thing -- the only em
barrassing thing was whenever I 
ate with him in public, people 
came up and wanted his autograph. Whenever. Th
ey must have thought I was too a Nazi. And 
the other interesting thin
g about it was it™s quite true, it gave
 me  insights into other things. For 
example, whenever he talked about Hitler ne
gatively, his eyes lit up. I 
mean, Hitler mu st have 
had a treme ndous charisma , because this ma n, even you know, denying everythi ng, thinking 

everythi ng was dreadful now. Genuinely thinking it 
was dreadful, his eyes lit up when he talked 

about Hitler. Oh, I learned a lot 
from him, oh yes. I never wrot
e about him, I wrote about him 
once in an Australian paper, cause I didn™
t want him to see it, particularly.  
Q:     What did he teach you about Hitler, did 
he  teach you -- I m -- I mean, ec -- except for the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
50 
 
A:     We ll, he -- sort of in -- everything that™s 
in his excellent me moirs, 
but in a kind of different 
way, yeah. For example, Hitler™s at titude towa
rds wome n is very rema rkable, he never knew 
Speer was married, and Speer was ma rried with eight
 children, or some thing like that. I mean, he 
was not only ma rried, really ma rrie
d. He never knew it, Hitler ne
ver knew it. He never asked, he 
never knew. You see, you lear
n the tidbits like that. 
Q:     What about when you went to this not -- 
this cultural -- th-the remn
ants of [indecipherable] 
cultural -- what was that  -- 

A:     Ah. That -- I wrote about 
that, too. They di -- that was in one of the castles in upper Hesse, 

which was sort of the center of 
neo-Nazi activity. And they read to
 each other, poetry. They gave 
a prize called the Adenauer prize, after the ol d ch
ancellor, yes, and things like that. And what I 
did there is -- I couldn™t go 
under my  own na me , so I borrowed the name  of a good friend who 
was a Count. And it™s very typical of this kind of
 rightist person that when you come  as a Count 
he ask -- they ask no questions, they accept you, of
 course, immediately. 
‚Course, it was a well-
known, old German na me . 

Q:     So what was that like for you to -- 

A:     It was fa
scinating, I loved it. 
Q:     Well, tell me about it. 

A:     Huh?  

Q:     Te -- te -- tell me  a bout it. 

A:     We ll, I came there as one of them. I 
know the language, I know everything like that, and I 

was a voelkisch writer, poet, or whatever, I forg
et what I ma de myself out  to be. Count von -- I 
won™t give you the name  because the lady is still 
alive. Count von so and so, yes. And I had to be 
very on my -- on my toes, because they said, Co
unt, you know, and that was me . And then I -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
51 
 
viewed the late Mathilde Leudendorf, you know, the 
wife on that, and the af
terplay was this, that 
the people who were in my house in Madison says
, ﬁThree boxes arrived for Count so and so at 
36 Glenway, Madison, who is that? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI
t™s me .ﬂ She se nt her collected works.  
Q:     Did you talk abou
t that period with them? 
A:     What?  Yes, of course. No, to Mathilde Leudendorf I wanted some  specific information 

again first, about some  other voelkisch person who was important, and so on and so forth, yeah. 

Well Speer would talk constantly 
about the Nazi period, that was 
after -- the period of his glory. 
What it was like in Paris when he went there 
with Hitler, you know, and Arnold Breker, and so 
on. Spr -- yes.  

Q:     You taught in South Africa? 

A:     Yes, I did. 

Q:     That was in 1980. 

A:     ™80. 
Q:     What was that -- that like, wa
s that like going back in time, that -- 
A:     No, it was very interesting because 
nobody knows, I mean, people are so ill-informed. 
There was a law on the upper side, 
that any course given at a white
 university that was not given 
at a black university, blacks could attend. So I ga
ve a course on the history of nationalism, yes, 
and my cour se was 50 percent black. And that wa
s very interesting, I got to know, and they took 
me  to Soweto, and they took me  here and took me 
there. It wa s very interesting, yes. And I had 
some  very good friends there. And Cape Town is 
certainly the most beautiful city in the world, I 

mean there™s no question about that. I had a ve
ry good time, and I was interested -- again, I™m 
not, you know, like always interested
 in victims, I™m s -- I™m s o metimes interested in the other 
side. So I wa s interested in the Boers. I got to 
know some  Boers very well. I was there on behalf 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310

of the Jewish community to open what we called 
the Kaplan Chair of Jewish Studies at Cape 
Town. 
Q:     Did it surprise you what happened 
in the last few years?  That it was -- 
A:     Yes, of course. Very much so. Yes, I mean 
it™s very difficult to get used to it. I mean, I -- I 
was only there, you know, what is it, two months
 or some thing, but it was tough, yes, seeing this 
-- this apar theid in action, yes, yes. 

Q:     Did you like to go -- 

A:     I mean, to me it was interesting as a r 
-- as an expert on race, I mean, you know, one should 

-- I had just written, Towards the 
Final Solution, and you know, to see 
it is interesting, and to see 
the diverse attitudes of people towards it, youknow. And they -- it -- 
it was very humiliating 
because, for example, in the hotel where I lived, 
all the blacks and colored, yes, always address 
me as ﬁbaasﬂ -- master. And I said 
you don™t really -- I don™t 
really like it, but 
I couldn™t break it. 
To the last I was ﬁbaasﬂ. I mean, you come  into a 
colonial situation actually. That™s what it -- you 
must put it that way. 

Q:     Hopefully in a fe
w years they won™t say that. 
A:     I think now they don™t say that any more. 

Q:     George, tell me  about how you view Holocaust studies, as a whol
e, the kind of history 
that™s done, the kind of -- 

A:     No, much of it is extremely good, I mean, 
I -- I -- I™m not -- you ja --
 I don™t really have an 
overview. Now, the background of the Holocaust, yes, there have been some  very good studies, 

on -- on the Holocaust, too. But ther
e are vast, oddly enough, neglec
ted areas one can think about 
at once. One is wome n i n the Holocaust, yes. 
Homosexuals, that area™s 
being repaired now. An 
excellent book by Gauss and so on, that™s being re
paired. Gypsies is being repaired, yes. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
53 
 
look how long it is after the Holo
caust, how long it took, yes. I 
mean, that™s the astonishing 
thing, yes. And -- and still, I don™t think there 
is enough about the vic
tims, oddly enough. What 
they felt, what they thought. We  know a lot a
bout the perpetrators, bu
t a -- again, not enough, 
because Holocaust scholars have be en either historians or  English professors. If they™re English 
professors, they go in for the literary. If they™re historians, they go in for the instrume ntal. But 

what about the mi ndset of these people, yes?  There are some , but not an awful lot on that sort of 

stuff. [indecipherable] 

Q:     How would you suggest some one 
do that sort of work, given that -- 
A:     We ll, it™s very difficult to do, but you™d ha
ve to go through it, you™d 
have to look at their 
background, you™d have to look at -- you know, to see 
if there™s anything in the documents that 
can tell you anything. What analogies they ma de, 
let™s say, during the killing process. What do 
you think they were doing?  And yo
u™ll find that they ma de analogi
es. That™s just one thing, I 
mean, there are ma ny others, yes. 
Q:     Do you think there™s some thing almost too fr
ightening to really look 
at the victims, and to 
really look at the perpetrators -- 
A:     No. 

Q:     -- that instrume ntal
ities are easier in some  way? 
A:     That may very well be 
true. I think -- I don™t th
ink that, for example is true to Hilberg, who 
was purely instrumentalities -- a very importa
nt book, I mean, the first -- but no, I don™t think 
that™s true, necessarily, no, no. It™s
 pretty abstracted. I mean, it™s aw
ful, it™s frightening, but -- but 
a -- I don™t think that ™s 
really the main reason. 
Q:     What do you think it is? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
54 
 
A:     I don™t know why, the omission of wome n i s
 clear, that some how in
 our culture that™s a 
very deep stream, that men do these things, wome n 
don™t do this, yes. I think it™s -- in a way it™s 
as simple as that, yes.  
Q:     You mean in term
s of the perpetrators, right? 
A:     Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wome n 
don™t do these things, it™s not a woma nl y thing to do. So, I think 
there you have to look at the stereotypes and 
things that go with, yes. With the wome n. 
Q:     But what about looking at wome
n victims ?  That™s also been neglected. 
A:     Yes, that™s been very much neglected, ye
s, yes. In fact, nobody -- looking at victims is very 
difficult. Most of them c a n™t speak to us any 
mor e , yeah. And the others that do speak, you know 
it better than I do. But yes,
 there isn™t an awful lot on victims.
 Victims are shown being victims. 
But what they thought, what they felt and so on, th
at™s -- that™s not there,
 you know. Or that it 
was tougher for wome n t han for me n, which 
I well believe. That™s not there. 
Q:     [indecipherable] you believe
 that. Why do you think that™s so? 
A:     We ll, I don™t know, I just feel it. Becau
se, I mean, wome n have other needs than me n at 
times, and things like that, yeah. 

Q:     Have you interviewe d vi
ctims as well as perpetrators? 
A:     No, no, no, no, no. 

Q:     Did you -- did you ever meet anyone who was on a Jewish Council? 

A:     No -- yeah, well, Guttman, of cour
se. No, he wasn™t on the Council, was he? 
Q:     No, I don™t think so. 

A:     No, no. I don™t know what it would be. Th
at I would find very uncomfortable. There I -- 
with Hannah Arendt, I mean, she was dead wrong 
about it, dead wrong, but 
I still some how feel 
like it, but that™s very -- I don™t know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
55 
 
Q:     You think she was wrong? 
A:     When -- what she said about Jews, yes 

Q:     About the Jewish -- the Jewish [i ndecipherable] 

A:     Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. They were very
 brave and courageous people. That was not an easy 

thing to do, and Hannah Arendt is absolutely 
crazy about that. What would she have it, no 
councils?  It would have been -- 
it couldn™t have been worse, but 
it would have been quicker, it 
would have been -- I don™t know
. At least the councils did some thing, even if they only 
postponed the death of one person, 
it would already be justified. I 
have a great respect for the 
Councils, but I think what they did was so horri
ble, and took so much courage, that I would 

really be uncomfortable in their presence. 

Q:     What about some body like Gens in -- in Wilno -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- who also wouldn™t 
help the resistance in
 ma ny ways, or would denounce people. I me an, 
when you have situations 
like that, does that -- 
A:     We ll, you™d have to look at it. I mean, I 
-- I can see -- I mean, if it™
s a less evil to prevent a 
greater one, in such an extreme situ
ation, I could see that. Anyway -- 
Q:     So you™re much mo re sympathetic, even
 though it mi ght be diffi
cult to talk to some body 
who [indecipherable] 

A:     Yes, I am sympathetic because first all, 
it™s a situation which I can™t really grasp. I can 

grasp almost everything about the Holocaust, but th
at situation I find very
 difficult to grasp. And 
second of all, I -- I don™t know what I would have
 done in such a situation. I mean, you can™t 
really criticize people who are 
put in such a position in such a time, you know?  I must assume  
they did their best, ‚cause they 
had -- they -- they had nothing to 
gain by not doing their best, in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
56 
 
sense. Sure, they didn™t support 
the resistance, and they didn™t
 support the uprisings and so on, 
probably because they thought th
ey would fail, I mean, you know? 
Q:     What do you think about the argume nts abou
t was there resistance, wa
sn™t there resistance, 
was there enough resistance? 
A:     Oh, I think they™re -- they
™re jejune, they™re -- they
™re -- they™re -- they™re
 -- fi rst of all they 
have a lot to do with a book I™v
e just finished on ma sculinity, 
you know. Like Bettelheim says in 
his book, The Informed Heart, why did they di -- 
why weren™t they me n?  Why did they die this 
way?  You know?  That itself shows 
a historical stereotype, yes. I 
mean, that™s silly. I mean, what 
do you expect them to do?  Yes?  I mean, that ju
st shows they have no grasp what it was about, 
they have no grasp how people behave under such
 circumstances. They have no grasp about the 

circumstances, yes. And they are completely ca
ught up in -- in war images, like the perpetrators, 
they have that in common with the perpetrators
, both think of this as war. One thinks a war 
against the Jews, the other thinks th
e Jews have behave
d like soldiers. 
Q:     Or should have behaved like -- 

A:     Yeah, should have -- so this is where bot
h are -- I think both are 
-- are to be condemned.  
Q:     There™s some thing about how you understa
nd things, it™s not just that you understand them 
from a cultural perspective -- 

A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- but you really attempt to understand 
things from the way people, ordinary people 
perceive, taking [indecipherable] their lives. 

A:     Yes, I try, I try, yes. 

Q:     And -- 

A:     I try. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
57 
 
Q:     And some  of the people you™re
 criticizing, like Hannah Arendt -- 
A:     Yeah. 
Q:     -- certainly had an incredib
ly elitist point of view about -- 
A:     Yes, quite right, qu
ite right, but this doesn™ t keep
 them from having insights. 
Q:     Right. 

A:     No, my hist -- kind of
 history I do mi ght really be calle
d a history of perceptions, that™s 
what I would think cause I believe people ac
t on their perceptions, 
and their perceptions 
some ti me s have very little to 
do with reality. I used to say 
to my students, you know, fo -- you 
also live by perceptions, cause 
if you saw yourself as you really are, you would commit  suicide. 
You know, thank God we don™t see e
ach other as we really are. 
Q:     But if we live by our perceptions, which 
I think is probably true a lot of the time -- 
A:     Yeah. 

Q:     -- how do we get to see some  reality sothat we don™t move in th
e directions that we™ve 
seen -- 

A:     You per -- 

Q:     -- like genocide, and so on. 

A:     -- yeah, your perceptions are, however, 
also informed by reality. I mean, that depends on 
the person. If they are formed by reality, you know what happened, you try to move a way from 

it, obviously, yes. But the whole world is now
 perceptions: what do we know about the people 
who rule over us?  What do we know about anythi
ng?  We  don™t, it™s all 
me diated, yeah. It all 
plays on our perceptions, or trie
s to manipulate them. So that™s
 nothing new, you mi ght say that 
that ki nd of fascist liturgy and so on was real
ly the beginning of m
odern politics, you know. 
Q:     Of i ma ges. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0310  
58 
 
A:     Yeah, politics through images, mm-hm.  
Q:     Does the contemporary war in
 the former Yugoslavia surprise you? 
A:     Oh no. It was always the case there. That
™s   why I am not with 
the Bosnians, cause I don™t 
believe in small political units, 
I believe in large political un
its. If you divide the Balkans up 
again, you™re going to have nothing 
but war, was quite clear. Ever
y unit has claims against every 
other. So the only thing is to have them all in
 one big -- like Yugoslavia, one big federal system.
