Q:  So     
A:  Like some people they were later on    be
cause I left early, not early enough though    
that were attacked.  Matter of

normal that a child would live

Q:  Yes.   
So tell me    what 
was my thought here? 
The German family that wrote to you, did th

mean     
A:  No. 
Q:     did they describe the circumstances? 
A:  I didn 't ask them, okay, because I knew. 
 They didn't have to write me and I didn 't 
have to ask them.  They were    one day they
 were told in that v illage to go to a town 
Würzburg.  You ever heard of it?  

Q:  Würzburg, um hum.  

A:  Oh, you heard of it?  They
 were the next biggest town . 
 And I came from a very small 
village.  And they sent them to
 a concentration camp and gasse

That was the end. 

Q:  And your brother, what happened with him?

Q:  I can 't imagine what it's 
like to not know what 
happens to people, to realize that your 
family has been taken away and you are so 
far away.  I can 't imagine what kind of a 
feeling that is. 
A:  The sad part is, I h ad family here and th
ey  wouldn't give me an affidavit to bring 
them out.  Terrible.  That's the terrible thing. 

Q:  Did someone give your brother an affidavit eventu ally? 
A:  My brother, he    he went to 
Ho lland.  How he got there, I don't know. 
Q:  How did he leave there?  How did he leave Holland? 
A:  I don't know how he got there. 
Q:  Okay .  
A:  Because I was in Holland, but they
 wouldn't let me st

Q:  Of course.  Of course.   

Did he stay the whole time in Holland 
or did he also come to America? 
A:  Didn't come to America. 

Q:  Ah, did he stay then 
in Holland during the war? 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  So he mu st have hidden? 
A:  Well, I don't know too mu ch  about it, but 
we corresponded.  But he went to Swed en

Q:  Uh huh.  So 
he went to Israel? 
A:  No, he didn't  go to Israel.  But the last ti

Holland to

A:  In Holland. 

Q:  There was a kibbutz in Ho lland? 
A:  It's like a kibbutz. 
Q:  Like a kibbutz?  And th en    

A:  An organization, a Jewish
 organization let's call it.  
Q:  And     
A:  And they  probably sent him to 
Sweden to save th

Q:  That's  right.  
A:     the people. 
Q:  Okay .  And in Swed en 
   when    after    did he survive the war?

Ho locaust, but he nevertheless died after the war? 
A:  Yeah.  I imagine.  Becau
se he was in Sweden, he was 
not in Germany anymore.  But 
my  sister died in Germany.  Sh e never got out 
of Germany.  But the fact is that, I'm sorry 
I have to say that, I personally couldn't do very
 mu ch.  And I depended
 on my family.  I 
had uncles and aunts.  They  didn't do anything.  
That's the sad part.  That's  the sad part.   
I have an uncle here he came 
here, let's say, about 1880.  
He was at that time maybe 70 
years old.  And he co uld have give me an
 affidavit for my fam

anything. 
Q:  That's  very bitter.

Q:  Okay . 
A:  The American army 
just had the beachhead. 
Q:  Yes.

A:  In Ritchie what kind of     
Q:  Training it was, uh huh.  
A:  Army of occupation.  They called it in
telligence camp.  I don't know how intelligent 
you had to be.  But it's  different from    
from    the usually    the usual training. 
Q:  Yeah.  But then you met probably
 with lots of other people     
A:  Sure.  

Q:     who were in the same situation?

Q:  And when you captured a German solde

serial number and your job 
was to find out more?   
A:  Yeah.  So you tried to get information. 
 But I didn't do that very long.  Because when

Q:  What is the right way to talk?  
I'm trying to find out your method.  
A:  Well, the method is    I was trai

Q:  Sure.  

A:  How to interrogate people. 
Q:  I mean, are you pleasant or are you distant?
  Do you act with authority and fear or do 
you use sweetness?

glad when the war was 
over.  You know?  
Q:  The people? 

A:  The people. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  So that helped.  
So if you talk right, you got some 
information out of them.  But there 
were two ways    there was interrogating pris

there?  I can't arrest th e German
