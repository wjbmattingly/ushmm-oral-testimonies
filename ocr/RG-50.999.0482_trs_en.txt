T he lif e stories ofHolocaust surv

Henry Kahn was bornHeinz Kahnon January
 
18, 1923, in Boblingen,
 
Germ any.  T his

A sso cia t ion .   
 
 
Novem ber
 
9through 10, 1938, the Nazis unleashed a wave of  violent attacks on 
Je wish -
o wned businesses and synagogues throughout Germ any known as Kristallnacht or the 
Night of Broken Glass.  Henry's f ather was arrestedand sent to Dachau concentration camp.  
T hisphoto shows a Jewish
-
o wned businessdestroyed during Kristallnacht.  Henry'sf ather 
returned home am onth later. Shortly af ter this, Henry lef t Germany through a Kindertransport, 

a rescue effort thatbrought thousandsof  Jewish children toGreatBritain from Nazi Germany 
between 1938 and1939.  Henry arri ved in England in February
 
1939. 
 
 
W henW or l d W ar  I I bega n  S e pt em b e r

were selected to return to Englandonly to end up in Bom bay, India.  The arrow on this map 
points to Bom bay.

In 1946, Henry m ovedto the United States. Af ter the war Henry learned that Nazi 
authorities deportedhis parents to the Lodz ghetto in1941
.  T
hey were laterm urdered.  We

Henry m et Doreen in Bom bay in 1943.
 
 
Just afew m onthsaf ter Henry's arri val in New York in 1946 he was draf ted into the 
U.S. Arm y. W ith theend of the draft he was honorably discharged
 
in the spring of 1947.  
Henry's s weetheartf rom  Bombay, Doreen Raym ond,arrived in theU.S. June
 
9,  19 4 8.  T he y 
were m arried 18 days later, June
 
27, 1948.
 
 
Af ter working in theexport/importbusiness Henry went into the scrap metalbusiness.

time and raising af am ily he enrolled at the City Universit y of  New York as 
an evening student

.   He
 
earnedhis degree in industrial managem ent in1966. Doreen 
attended Queens College getting a degreeasa paralegal and worked as a paralegal
 
in the 
E

1988.  He then became a real estateagent
.  F
ollowing a diagnosis of  lung cancer in1992, 
Henry retired f rom his real estate work.
  
 
 
Henry and Doreen raised two sons, Ralph born in 1952, and Roy David born July

1954, 60 years ago this week.  Their sons gave them two grandsons and a granddaughter.  

And Henry's son Roy is here with Henry today.
 
 
T here you are right there

T o be closer to theirfam ily, Henry and Doreen moved toBethesda,Maryland in 2000.  
Doreen passed awa

Henry continues to volunteer atthe Montgomery County T

he contributed their tim e together.  Following the lossof  Doreen, Henry became involved 
with this m useum asavolunteer.  You will t ypi cally f ind Henry here on Sundays where hehas

English and Germ an,walks regularl y, spends tim e in a woodworking shop, tends to his indoor 
garden of exotic plants, readsa lot, and spends time with fam ily and f r

W ith that I'd liketoask you to join me in welcom ing our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
,  Mr.
 
Henry Kahn.
 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Henry Kahn: T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Henry. 
 
 
Henry, thank you so muchfor joining usandfor your wi llingness to be our
 
F i r s t  Pe r
so n
 
today.  Youhave somuch to share with us inless than an hour, sowe'll start.  You were j ust 

10 when Hitler and
 
the Nazis cam e to power.  Bef ore we turn to those years and the war and 
the Holocaust, tell us a little about your fam ily and youbefore the Nazis were in control of 

Germ any.
 
>> Henry Kahn: W ell,as you heard, I was born in Boblingen, whichwas abouteight m iles 

southwest of Stuttgart.W e lived there,m y parents lived there.  I was the first son. W e were 
ver y f riendly with a lot of  people
 a
nd  s pe c if i c al l y a M r .
 
Kindler and Mrs.
 
Kindler. They had two 
daughters which were m y age as well as m y brother'sage. W eplayed together.T he par
ents

they went out. T hey went skiing and played tennis. And also one day I understand, I know, 
they went to a masked ball.  My father was aSpaniard.  My m otherwas a 
pompadour
.  S
o  we  
had quite very good relations with everybody. 
 

 
In 1930, we m oved toStuttgart. I was 7 years old by then. I went to school.  T he 
school I went to was the 
W aldorf  School
.  
T he school was aprivate school,not apublic school.  
T he philosophy was very m odern and very dem ocratic.  Boys and girls were in thef irst grade 
together,m ixed. Theboys learned how to knit. T he boys and girls learned how to do 
woodwork in the thirdgrade.  I was very f riendly with m y classm ates. We went out together.  
Andeven when Hitlercam e, the schooldidn't
 
--
 
nobody was diff erent after Hitler came,notin 
the school.  But you have to remember, it was a private school. Sothat's already presele
cted.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Henry, you were at the W aldorf  School, I think,one day you were roughedup 
by som e kids and your parents report
ed
 
it toyour teacher. T ell usabout that.
 
>> Henry Kahn: W ell,you know, kidding around. W e were knocking around.  My
 
clothes were 
disheveled,as they say.  Andm y parents com plainedto Mr.
 
Hager.  He was m y class teacher.  
I like you to remember the nam e because he com e
s 
up lateronagain.  For two hours he 
lecturedthe kids to conduct them selves properly.  And if  anything further should happen to m e, 
I should report it im mediately to him , which Inever
 
--
 
I hadno intentions of ever doing that.
 
[Laughter]
 
W hichI didn't. But there was no needfor it because nothing happenedanymoreaf ter that.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n : W ill yo u
 
tell us a little bit about your father?  As we m entionedearlier, he 
served in the FirstW orld W ar. Do you know m uch about his service?

>> Henry Kahn: W ell,he was
 
--
 
excuse m e. He got adraf t notice, Ibelieve when he was 19 
years old.  He lived in a
 
small village with his m other.  Hisfather had passed away.  Andhe 
hadto go to theboard.  However, his m otherhoped he wouldn't besent too far away.  So they 
hadactually assigned him  to the cavalry whic h would have been inanother town.  Sothe 
m othe
r 
--
 
you know wh at the officer did?  Heassigned 
h im
 
to  t he  N av y
, w
hich was not only 
three years butfour years
™ 
service.  In them eantime
 
--
 
that's theattitude.  In the meantime,the 
war broke out.  So he literally
 
--
 
he was thereuntil the very end.  So
 
the war was f our years.  
My f ather was in servicefor seven years. Hegot a decorationfor his services.  But that didn't 

help in the end.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But he won the 
I ron  C ro s s
. He was a decorated soldier in the Germ an
 
--
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Absolutely.  That's what I said basically.  Got the 
Iron  C ro s s
, whatever. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Henry, your f am ily suff ered aterrible tragedy in 1932 when your brotherdied 

of  an  i nf e c t i on.
 
>> Henry Kahn: T hat's right.  He hadm astoid inf ectionof  theear. He died of
 
it.   In c id e nt ally,  
P
enicillin had been invented
 
--
 
or discovered, I should say, in 1927. However, the news didn't 
get aroundfast enough.  So m y brother couldn't be saved.  So thatwas it.
 
 
Now, we were in Stuttgart.  My f ather was thePresident of a 
Ca t
tle Dealers™ 
A sso cia t ion  
f oraf ew countries.  Germ any
 
--
 
li ke the United States, Germ any was split up in 
different countries. T here wasW uertemberg, Hohenzollern, etc., etc.  You go to a geography 
lesson and you learn m ore about it. 
 
[Laughter]
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

So he was
 
President of  that organization.  T hen 
‚
33 cam e.  And theNazis cam e into power .  
T here was anenviousm ember of  theassociation.  He, inuniform  with som e other guys, 
walked intom y f ather's off iceand told him  toget out.  He threw thekeys on thef loor 
and 
walked out.  
 
 
Of course, now he was without a job.  You couldn'tdoanything about it because the 
Nazis were in power.
  
Howe ver, m y f ather was under the impression that sincehehad the 
Iron 
C ro s s
 
andall of that and had served Germany before thatnothing muchm ore couldhappen to 
him .  W ell, unfortunat
e ly  
he was dead wrong; dead wrong.  
 
 
My f ather wentto Palestine at that tim e, af tera couple ofm onths
,  
tof ind out whether 
it's possibleto live there. W hen he cam e back, he said, well, if  you live there the way we have 

to live over there, we'll last a long tim e.  Here, too, he was wrong. 
 
 
My m other wanted to em igrate alm ost imm ediately.  Inorder to do that, she prepared, 
learning how to sew ties, m ake candies and shirts.  All of that she learned in
 
order to be able to 
do som ething. W eallhad planned to com e to the United States. 
 
 
So afterm y f atherhad returned he had to dosom ething.  In them eantim e, I went to 
school, o
f  course. In1935 we moved to Cologne. T he reason we moved there is becaus
e  m y 
father was able to take over a
 
p ly
wood
 
com pany.  My m other was very m uch opposed, but the 
attitudeat thattim e was, between husband and wif e, that thehusband doesand you haveto 
do whatever hedoes. 
 
[Laughter]
 
It wasn't wom en's libat that time.  
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Unfortunately I wish she would have succeeded. W ell,that was 
‚
35.  In 
‚
35, the 
Nurem berg Laws came into effect.T he Nurem berg Laws, they f orbade Jews to m ix with 
non
-
Jews so much so that ifa person
 
--
 
we had a wom an who worked in our hom e.  And ifa 
person was below
 
--
 
a Christian person, if  hewas below the age of 40, was by law ordered to 
leave.  Below 40and over 40, I guesspeopleknow what I'm  talkingabout. 
  
So we weren't 
allowed to go to the swim m ing pool, tom ovies.  It was rather restricted.
  
And gradually the pain 
of f ear started to permeate me andother people, too.W ell, that was 
‚
35. 
 
 
I went toa Jewish school.  In 1938, Jewish children inGermany, atthattim e, had to 
leave all public schools.  T hey couldn't go there anym ore. 
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Before you turn to m oreabout 
‚
38, youhad mentioned your mother madeall 
kinds of preparations.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Im entioned that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasgoing to add one other one.  Oneof  the things in preparing, she wanted 
you learn how to blow
 gla ss.   
>> Henry Kahn:  Oh, yes.  W here we lived in Cologn
e
, a superintendent taught me how to 
blow glass.  T hat, too,cam e in very handy in 
late r years.  I'll com e to th a t. 
 
 
T he next thing, November, 
‚
39
 
--
 
the9th of  Novem ber,9 to 10 of Novem ber
 ‚
39, 
Kristallnacht.  Kristallnacht was the legal riots in Germ any where the Nazis went wild.  It wa s 
terrible. T hat's all I can say.
 
 
Howe ver, on them orning of the 10th, af riend of m ine cam e. Inourstreet,I couldn't 
see anything.  But
 
the friend cam e and told me, " D
on't go to school today becausethere's too 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
m uch trouble over there." Our synagogue was notburnedbecause it was adjacent to other 
buildings.  So what they did, they ransacked it. T he school was next door to it also. So 
consequently I didn't
 
go to school either. 
 
 
T he  ne
xt day m y father was arrested and taken tothe police station. T wo people in 
civi lian clothes cam e and picked him up. Onthe way to the police station my father asked 
what would he have done if hehadn't been hom e. T hey sai
d , 
ﬁW
ell, we would have gone to 
your neighbor who's also Jewish in order tofulf ill our quota.
ﬂ
  
So, inother words, there was no 
reasontoarrest anybody in particularf orany specif ic reason
 a
s long as they were Jewish
; 
t
hey had tof ill their quota.
 
 
M y 
m other went to theGestapo,the secret statepolice. [Speaking in Germ an]
 
T hey told
 
--
 
sheaskedm y f atherto be released. T hey told her that he'll come home.  
Howe ver, he didn't com ehom e.  So she had to go thereagain. Asit turned out, there was 
anot
herm an there of the name ofm y f ather. They hadm ixed them up. Evidently som ething 
like this happened tom e, too, later on. 
 
 
Af ter he cam e hom e, shortly thereafter, we received a surpri
se telegram  f rom  m y 
cousin in
 
England
 s
aying dates. T he reason was
 
in order to see whether I'm  qualif ied to get on 
the Kindertransport.  The British governmenthadpassed a law whic h would allow up to 10,000 
children unaccompanied,below theage of 17, to com e to Englandprovided they had 
sponsors. W ell,m y cousin was able to getasponsorf orm e. He wasf riendly with a girl 
whose father was partowner of a clothingf actory and they were will i ng to takem e.
 
 
On the 2ndof  February
 
1939,m y parents and I went to the railroadstation.

>> Bill Benson:  Henry, m ay I stopfor am inute?  Bef ore you tell us about going to England, tell 
us about your father being releasedf rom  Dachau.  Heeventually cam e home from  Dachau, 
r i gh t ?
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Im entioned it, I think.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what he said when hecam e hom e.  He
 
cam e hom e af ter about a 
m o nth . 
 
>> Henry Kahn:  He said
, ﬁI
f  Iever I get into the concentration camp,I will not com e out alive.
ﬂ
  
He was correct. 
 
 
So now on the 2ndof February
 
1939,m y parents tookm e tothe railroad station.  I 
said goodbye to them  through the window.  And I knew within m e positivel y I'm  going to meet 

them  again.  I was so sure.  My parents lef tthe platform.  Four orf ive minutes laterthey cam e 
back because they had found out that thetrain had beendelayed. T he moment I saw them  i
t 
hit me like this. T his is theone which I was sure I was going to seeagain but Inever saw them 

again. 
 
 
T he train
 
--
 
I mentioned before thefear which constantly stayed in us, probably a lotof  
people.  Cologne is pretty close to the D
utch border.  On
ce we crossed the Dutchborder there 
was a little girl in the com partment, in the railroad car.  She hadan illustratedpaper with her.  

T here was a picture of Hitler.  She made surethatthe Dutch peoplewere coming in and we 
were not in Germ any anym ore. 
 
Shetook thispicture of Hitler and tore it into athousand 
pieces. So you can imagine how relieved we all were that we were out of Germany by then. 
 

 
W ell, we crossedthe Channel. W e got into Liverpool 
S
tation inLondon. I knew a

lit t le
 
--
 
you see, in
 
t h e 
W aldo r f  S c ho o l
,  
notonly did you know how to knit and sew, we also had 
English and Germ an in the f irst grade. Sonot that we learned a lot,but we got the sound of  it.  
And that was excellent.  So I hada little knowledge of English.  And, of  course,
 
in Cologne, I 
went to a Jewish school, as I mentioned bef ore, and there we, too,hadEnglish and French. 
 
W e were in this big room .  Everybody had a tag for identif ication.  I thoughtI was going to help 
som ebody.  There was a lady com ing
, a
f ter quite a while a lady coming in a nice leopard coat. 
I decidedI'll ask her I couldhelpher. So I walked up to her and I said, "
M
ay I help you?
ﬂ  A
nd 
she said
 
--
 
she took out a piece of  paper and wrote 
ﬁ
Heinz Kahn.
ﬂ
  
That was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas you. 
 
>>
 
Henry Kahn: T hatwas m y sponsor. W ell, m y cousin cam epretty shortly there
af te r.  He  
drove the car.  I got prom ptly lost in the Londonfog.  It was very f oggy that day.  Eventually we 

arrived in the house.  W ehad a good dinner.  And thef irst thing I had to learn was how to eat 
the English way.  No w what is the English way?  Peas,the green little peas.  You can't eat 
them  like this.  You can't take a spoon. Youhave to takeafork, turn it upsidedown, andplant 
it .  W e ll, it ' s  k in d of d if f ic u lt .   Yo u
 
gettwo, three,f our and you ate it. T hat I had to learnf irst. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
W ell, she was ver y particular aboutthat. W e lived in a very beautif ulhome
, o
ne
-
f a m ily 
home in Ham
p
stead 
G
arden
S
uburb.  T he f irst thing Mr.
 
London askedm e was do you want t
o 
go to school ordo youwant to work. W ell, I gave it some consideration.  However, I decided I 
would like to go to work.  There were two reasonsfor that
:  n
um ber one, I hadnom oney 
whatsoever
; a
nd, number two, I wanted to get to the United States.And in orderto getthere I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
would have had tohave som e sort of a trade.  I knew nothing.  I went to school, sure. 
  
So  I  
decided I'd like to go to work.  
 
 
S o  Mr.
 
London was the partowner of a clothing factory, as Im entionedbefore.  He got 
m ea working perm it.  I guess you needed that, which was f or an apprentice.  Now, in England, 

at that tim e, things were very strict.  Ever ything had to be just so. Apprentices got one pound a 
week, period. SoI was getting a pound a week.  Itold Mr.
 
London, ﬁL
ook, I live with you. You 
don'thave to give m e that muchm oney.
ﬂ  " O
h , tha t's o k."  A ll righ t.  
 
 
T hef irst thing I did is learn how to
 
make knots in the packing roomandhow to put on 
tags onpants, what they are, the names, brand names, whatever. 
 
W ell,  I  d id
 
this f or a while, 
but I didn't really learn anything.  Making knots, you can't get anything with that.
  
S o I  a s ke d 
le t  
m e go into the sewing room .  W ell,
 
it wasn't appropriate, I guess,for somebody who li ves with 
theboss to work with these comm on people
 
who work in the sewing room . W ell,there was

So I lived therefor a while. T hey were ver y nice.  He toldm eto work.  And he drove 
m ehom e.  At lunchtime I had lunch with them . At dinnertim e, I had dinner with thefam
ily .   A s  
wonderful as it was, itwas basically a glorif ied prisonbecause I couldn't do anything.  I had no 
m oney to go anyplace.  And even if  I did, I wouldn't know how to goabout it. T here was no 
public transportation or anything like this inthat area

when I wrote tom y m other about it, she was quite upset because 
she didn't likem e calling m yself Peter
 b
u t if  Mrs .
 
London liked it that way, that's ok. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you just said, you were at this time still able to comm unicate with your 

parents.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Yes. T here was no war yet. W e wrote to eachother, of  course. 
 
 
W ell, tim e went on.  T here was 
‚
39.  It didn't take very long.  In Septem ber, 
September
 
1, 1939, inspite of the fact that Hitler hadmadea prom ise to Mr.
 
Chamberlain that 
he hadnofurther am bitions to expand Germ any, he broke that word.  Of  course he brokemore 
words.  He brokethe word when he marched into Russia also. 
 
 
Anyway, since England had a pact with Poland
 
--
 
on the 3rd of  September
 
19 3 9 
Mr.
 
Cham berlain declared war on Germ any. Of course, thenall com munication was shutoff .  
Alm ost imm ediately the alarm s went off.  Butit was a falsealarm but it gave you a nice shock
 
l
istening af terthe war had been declared, I can assure you. 
 
 
By the way, when I went on the train, I was two weeks af term y 16th birthday.  If  
anybody here is15or 16 years old

nobody?  Oh, yeah,there aresom e.  Ok. W ell, youcan

yo u

that feels
o

experience. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som ewhat along those lines, Henry, after war broke out, soon after that

Mr.
 
Londontold you that you were going to have to go out on your own.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  I wascom ing to that.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  I wascom ing to that. Af ter the war broke out, Mr.
 
London told me, well, 
they're going to beevacuating. W em eaningMrs.
 
London, their daughter, and him self . 
T hey're going to evacuate. And Ihave to look for aplaceto stay. W ell
,  
in a way I was glad  
about this because I was out of the glorif ied prison. 
 
 
W e ll ,  I lo o k e d
 
around and Ifounda place in Finsbury P
ark.  T here's one also in 
LeisureW orld,a placecalled Finsbury Park Lane.  Anyway.  T hen Iasked Mr.
 
London 
to give 
m em ore money.  Buthe said, 
ﬁN
o, I can't.  You getone pound.
ﬂ
  
W e ll
,  
with one pound you 
can't do very m uch. Ihad topay for m y lodging andI had to take care of myself .  So that I 
didn't like very m uch.
  
But now I asked him again to let me work
 
on the m achine or let m e learn 
how to sew.  And this tim ehe couldn't refusem ebecauseI was onm y own.  And soon after I 

did that,I was good enough to go intopiecework.  And piece work allowed m etom akemore 
than one pound.  
 
 
In addition which they
 a ske d  
--
 
you see, at that time it was diff icult to get aholdof  
sewing needles. Andsom e of those wom en, they liked the ideaof breaking aneedle and 
asking for another one.  And som eof  them  didn't break theneedleand ask f or another one.  
So I was asked to take charge of the sewing needles. And I said, now, look, it's m y time. I'm  
workin g on piece work.  SoI got another Sixpence which is half  a shilling a day.  So it came 
out to 30 shillings, which is 50% more than what I had bef ore
 w
hich was good. 
 
And I saved as 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

m uch as I could because I certainly wanted to get to the United States.  
 
 
I got along f ine with everybody.  Not much happenedtill thef irstf ew m onths. 
  
O n a  
holiday in England, it's also in the UnitedStates but very f ew people are aware of it, we had a 
three
-
day weekend.  Idecided to gof ora bicycle ride to Oxf ord. W ell, the Oxf ord excursion
 
--
 
af riend of m ine was supposedto come with m e, but justbefore that tim eGermany invaded 

Holland, Belgium , and eventually France.  And things
 
gotpretty critical over there, but I 
decided to go anyway. 
 
 
So Idrove to Oxf ord.And in Oxf ord, everything was dead. There was nothing, which 
was rather disappointing.  If ound aplace tostay.  It was a private hom e.  And in them orning I 

overheard 
the radio say all f oreigners shouldreport to the police station imm ediately. W ell, I 
said to the landlady, 
ﬁW
here's the police station?
ﬂ
  
She said, 
ﬁW
hydo you want to know that?
ﬂ
  
And I said
, we l l ,  I  t h ough t

they said, ﬁI thought you were Irish.
ﬂ
  
Bu
t I wa sn 't. I wa sf ro m 
Germ any originall y.
  
So I went to the police station. T hey told me go backand stay there.  
T hat's all. Leave things alone. T ake iteasy.  
 
 
W ell, Idrove back.  And then, of course, the British Expeditionary Force, which had 
bee
n sent to France, had becom e surrounded in Dunkirk, which is to the south
 
--
 
the north of  
France, near the English 
C
hannel.T hey wer e surrounded. They had to be evacuated.  And 
m any,m any private boats, they went across the channel to take theBritish soldiers,as well  as 

French soldiers, back to England. They saved about 300,000people that they wouldn't be 
taken 
prisoners by theGerm ans. 
 
 
W ell, Englandbecam e panicky now, literally panicky.  They decided to intern

ever ybody who cam efrom  Germ any originall y.  T hef act that I wasa ref ugeef rom  Nazi

>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, you had a certif icate that said you were exem ptedf rom  internm ent and 

it didn't matter.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  No, no.  T hat's not correct.
 
>> B

>> Henry Kahn: T hatwas m y designation. Correct. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Gradually
 
--
 
this was June. Gradually I noticedthat some ofm y 
acquaintances were interned.  Realizing that,I decidedI would askfor a certif icatefromthe 
com pany,f rom  London Brothers, where I worked,and alsotookallm y m oney which
 
I had 
saved to theBloom sbury House.  TheBloom sbury 
H

lady, I toldher, look

when I get interned, get me out asfast as possible.  Andaf terthat get 
m ea chance to get tothe United States. W ell, she said them oney isn't quite enough but we'll 
m ake up the difference.  Fine. 
 
 
E xcu se  m e.  
 
 
I hadn't gottenm y certificate yet,butI insisted on it.  I said,

I want it today.
ﬂ
  
S u r e 
enough when I gothom ethe lady toldm etom orrow report to the police station,takeall

>> Bill Benson:  74 years ago today. 
 
>> Henry Kahn:  74 years ago today.  W e were taken to a race course where we stayedf or the 
night. T hen we were given a big pieceof  cheese,putona train, and taken to 
L
iverpool.  
Liverpool is a port city on the west coast of England.
  
It was raining cats anddogs. T he tents, 
they were partially coll apsed because they hadn'tbeenputupproperly.  Andf rom  theair it 
looked like an Arm y tent, of course. Of  course there was barbed wir e around it tomake sure 
we knew where we are. 
 
 
T hen we were told that Liverpool had been bom bed the week 
bef ore and a ship which 
hadtaken prisoners ofwar and internees to Canada hadbeen torpedoed and sunk andm any, 

m any lives were lost. 
 
W ell ,  no w
 
we were asked
 
who wants to be interned in an overseas 
dom inion.
  
Dom inion? W hat is adominion? W ell, Ifound
 
out in due course.
 
 
T he question was
 
--
 
do I answer yes or no?  
Do  
I 
want to be interned?  D
o 
I 
not want 
to be interned?  I mean sent overseas
.
  
I decided to takea chance andbetorpedoed rather 
than take a chance and stay in England andGod knows what's
 
goi ng to happen. First of all, 
they m ay straf e usasan Arm y cam p.  And then the Nazis would, Godforbid, come and take 

over. 
 
 
Seven days af ter I was interned we were taken aboarda ship, the HMT  Dunera, which 
was 73,000
 
pounds
 
--
 
73,000
 
tons, big enoughf or 1,500 people.  However, we were 2,500 
taken aboardthis ship.  All our luggage was put on abig pile in them iddle of  the deck.  I was 

assigned to the low deck
 i
n thef ront of the ship.  It was pretty crowd ed. I saw hooks on the

c e ilin g.   I  re a lize d
 
that's for hamm ocks.  So that was m y
 
--
 
I was looking f orward
 
--
 
th e  f irst 
night we slept any which way.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In addition tof ellow internees, others that were in the sameboat as you, so to 
speak, there were also prisoners of war.
 
>> H e n r y K a
hn:  Im entioned that, didn't I?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't know if  youdid.  
C an  y
ou say it again?
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Prisoners of  war which were  kept separateby a stupid little tent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So just on the other side of this fencef rom  you.
 
>> H e n r y
 
Kahn:  Sure. 
 
 
So the very sam e night, the 10thof  July, the ship pitchedand rolled like crazy.  I 
couldn't see anything outside
, b
ut I was surprised because there was no storm .  However, i t 
pitched and rolled because it zigza gged like crazy.  And sure e
no ugh  a  t o r pe
do was shotat us, 
hit the ship
 
but didnotexplode. It m ade a dent in the ship,though. 
 
 
W edrove north, rode north, and went west towards Canada.  Of  course, the prisoners 
of  w
ar were m ostly Navy people. They
 
knew all about it. T hroughthe grape
 
vines 
we got to 
know what was going on. They said, well, we're going to Canada. And then said no, we're 
going south.W ent south all the way down, around the C
a pe  of  G ood  H
ope, and then east all 
the way to Australia.  It tooktwo m onths to get t
here.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantyou to tellus som ething else before you talkabout getting to Australia.  
T ell us what the crew or the guards were like on the ship and whathappened to the luggage 
a
nd why that was signif icant.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
>> Henry Kahn:  All right. W ell,as Im entioned before, the luggage which we had was puton a 
big pile and a canvaswas put over it.  Every day when the weatherwas all ri ght, we were t old 
to runaroundthedeck.  T here was a machine gun on one side
 a
ndon theother side so that 
we  wo
uldn't do any harm . And there we saw that the canvas had been taken off and the 
luggage was being opened. The crew which  came along to guard us of  course was not the 
cream of  the cropf rom the British Arm y. T hey were really the scum of  it. Someof  them
 
ha
d 
glass eyes.  T here were drunkards inone instance.  One of those guys was so drunk that he 

hadtobe taken to the infirm ary.  And one of the internees picked up his gun and carried itfor 
him . So you can im agine what the situation was. 
 
 
Incidentally
, theoff icerin charge eventually became courtm artialed.  But that was wa y 
af ter the war. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And as they rif led through the belongings
 
--
 
>> Henry Kahn:  I know, I know.  I'm  com ingto it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  worried about running out of  tim e.  I know you want to tell us this.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  I know.  I will.
 
 
T hey went through that stuff.  Ididn't see where we were running around.  But Idid
 
--
 
the stink was getting pretty awf ul in thedeck
; i
n all the decks,by the wa y.  So I gota coup
l e of  
guys together, the youngsters. W e hadbuckets of water and mops.  And we chased after the 

people on one side. W e cleanedthe deck.  And then we cleaned the rest of the deck. That 
was considerably better thenaf ter that.  
 
 
So to give us a deal, we
 
were allowed to come on deck when otherpeople were not 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
21
 
allowed to com e on deck
 a
nd stay out there. And while we were out there, we noticed thatthe 
soldiers were throwing things overboard like crazy.  I m ean left and right. T hey opened up the 
su it ca se s
.  If  youhad a nam eonone of  your clothes, then you got som ething back which we 
got eventually.  Taking them f rom one deck to theother, all the item s that were left over.  But 
how can you identif y bed sheets or cans of soupor anything like that?  You can't.  So they 
threw it all overboard.  Maybe som e bologna. 
 
 
Howe ver, as bad 
a
sthat conduct was, and it was crim inal, believe it or not it probably 
saved our lives.  And the way that happened, becausethere was another U
-
Boat which cam e 
later. T he captain was curious what they wer e throwing overboard. T here were 
G e r m an
-
written letters.  And I found thatoutm any years later when I was in Stuttgart.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And possibly am ong those letters that were thrownoverboard was the letters 

f r om  yo u r  pa
rents thatyou lost.  Right? 
 
>> Henry Kahn: W ell,ever ything got lost. T hat's all right.  How quir ky things were som etim es, 

I cantell you.  So there were two instances where we were lucky.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You eventually did m ake it to Australia.
 
>> H e
nry Kahn: W ell,the ship m ade it to Australia, yeah. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
In Sydney we didn't have m uch to eat. And the tea was terrible. As it turned out,they 
put some stuff inthe tea to reduce our
 
--
 
how shall I say
 
--
 
our drives.
 
[Laughter]
 
Yeah.  T hat's 
a  f a c t.

All right.  So we were in it Australia. TheAustralian soldiers, they were adiff erent 
breed altogether.  They were wonderful.  We got sandwiches. W e were taken off  the ship.  W e 
were taken aboard atrain. W e rode18hours into the interior
. 
 
I watchedf rom the window how 
a kangaroo was jum ping along trying to racethe train, but,of  course, there was no contest. 
 

W earrived in the camp which was brand new.  It was beautiful.  Itwas very windy.  And the 
sand was blasting against our legs.  I 
felt like bei
n g s a nd
blasted, believe it or not. T he camp 
was there.  I guess we had something to eat.I don't rem em ber now. W e wentto sleep.
 
 
T he next m orning,13names were calledout and m ine wasf irst one on the list.  Com e 
back to the orderly room .
  
W ell, we went there. W e were told get your stuff.  Oneof  them  
over
heard oneof  the soldiers say, "T hese chaps are going back toEngland."  W ell, I wasn't 
asked.  I was told to go back, get m y luggage what little I had. I had nothing anym ore. I had a 

sugar bag
 
I  pu t  s om e st uf f  i n whi c h  I  go t  an d  so m e s t uf f  wh i c h  I  go t
 
--
 
I got toothbrushand 
toothpaste in Sydney. T hey gave it to us. 
 
 
So we went back to the train station, were taken back to Sydney, back on the ship, put 
in the bunker, lockedup.  W ell, I got scared stiff there.  T hat's thef irst tim e I really got scared.  

I meanphysically scar ed. We got som ething to eat.T hen we were taken out and taken tothe 
prison to aprison inSydney. T his was a compound off ive diff erentbuildings.  Andone o
f 
them  was designatedan internm ent cam p.
 
 
T here we m et an Italian who was internedf rom  Australia.  He got newspapers. We 
saw in the newspaper thatLondon was inf lam es,especially the lower east end where I used

and 
If ound out much, much later
 
--
 
thatm y release came 
through theday I went aboard the ship, on the 10th.  It was only seven days between the day I 
was internedand the day we went aboard the ship. Sothen you didn't have e

m a ils  o r 
anything like that.  It took longer to get them essage through.  So consequently I was released.  

I guess the others,I don't know.  It must be sim ilar.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sof rom Australia you eventually end backuponthe shipand you set sailfor 

England.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  No.

Af ter having been in Australia for10days, again 10 days, we went back to the ship whichwas

W ehelped them  loadpigs, half  pigs, cut in half,f rozen,of  course,which was provisioned

the street.  And we wer e taken to thepolice station. T he police,
 
they interviewed each one of

So

som ething.  Maybe you know someplace.
ﬂ
  
So he said, yes, you can go to a dental lab. He 
arrangedf orm e tohave a job as adental lab.  And while I was there, I used the skill which I

However, I didlearn som e bookkeeping.  
T hat helped. 
 
 
So now I was back in India. And the next jobI got was a bookkeeper in a company.  
T here I kept the books.  Before Idid this, I went to aboo

Ife lt a  little  safe r.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Our tim e is running short.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Yeah, I know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you don'tm ind, there'sa couple of things I wouldlike you 
to  
share with us 
bef ore we do that. T ell us about meeting your future wif e.  And thentell us about how you 
cam e tothe United States.
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Yes,yes, yes. W ell,f irst, Iwas
 
[inaudible]
 
f or3/4of  the year, thenI came 
back. Af riend of m inetold m e to go to the Maccabi Sports Club. T here we played ping
-
p on g.   
T here was a young girl  who played very wel l
;  
in f act
, 
so well she beat me alm ostall the time.  
So consequently I took revenge, eventually married her. But that was m uch later.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
T he trouble was, though, we fell in love, believe it or not. She wanted
 
to leave India, 
to o
, a
s Idid. In1946,bef ore we left, we m ade a conditionalengagem ent if  and when we meet 
again andf eel the same way about eachother as we do now, we'l l getm arried.  
 
 
T he only trouble was I went to the United States then. It'sa b
ig sto ry, b u t I go t in the 
Arm y.  I got outof  the Arm y.  That was the draf t law
 a
t th a t tim e.
  
She was born inIndia.  But 
there was no quotaf or people who were bornin India, so I hadto try and get herover 

som ehow. W hile I was in uniform , I went to the State Departm ent. And the State Department I 
spoketo somebody.  Iwasn't m arried. I hadnothing.  I wasn't evenm arried to her.  So I said 
to  the m
 
--
 
well, in the Arm y, you do things.  If you can't do them  officially, you candothem

a n ywa y.  
 
[Laught

So Iasked over therem aybe som ething canbe done to get herover.  
 
 
So oneday m y futurewife at thetim e worked across the streetf rom the American 
Cons
ulate. She got acall one day can you com e over
,  co
m eduring lunchtim e.  She went 
over.  She was
 a sked ,  
ﬁD
o you want to still go to the UnitedStates?
ﬂ
  
She said yes.  Ok.  So 
thenext day they called again
,  ﬁW
hen do you want to go?
ﬂ
  
So she had to give notice f irst and 
all of  that.  Sof inally, on June
 
9, 1948, she cam e.  And on the27thwe got m arr
ied. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we close and before you close I want to askyou oneother question. 
 

But bef ore Ido,I think, if
 
I'm  correct, youandyour wif e,before youwere m arried, bef ore she 
cam e tothe United States, exchanged 117 letters.  Right? 
 
>
> Henry Kahn: W eexchanged 117 letters. She wrote 117.  And Idid. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because in your memoir, num ber117 is the lastone she wrote f rom India 

b ef o r e s h e c am e .
 
>> Henry Kahn: T hat's right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One last question before youf inish. T ellus, whendid you learn what 
happened to your parents? 
 
>> Henry Kahn: W ell,
 
I 
learned itaf terI was in the United States
, afte r th e  wa r.  Id on 't know.  
It musthave gotten through.  I don't rem em ber where I got itf rom .Butmy parents were ki
lle d .   
T hey were sent toLodz, a concentration camp of  some kind.  My father died in thehospital

Henry? 
 
>> Henry Kahn:  Ok. First of all, Im entioned Mr.
 
Hager, m y classroom  teacher.  In 1962 I m et 
him  again in New York , not accidentally but I m et him there.  He told m e in 
‚
38 they had to
 
--
 
they dism issed all the students in theW aldorf School, all the teachers in the 
W al d o rf  S c h ool
.  
Andhe toldm e he worked ina torpedofactory and once ina while he put sand into the 

m echanism . And I asked
 
him  why did take such a chance. And hisanswer was,
 ﬁ
I wanted to 
play a trick on the Nazis.
ﬂ
  
Soall you know, I'm  here because of him.

If you know someonewhom  you dislike, infact really, deeply hatefor good reasons, 
try hard notto generalize.  Do not assum e that allm em bersof his or her ethnic ornational 
background are the sam e or have the same tendencies. Please rem em ber a baby knows love 
but to hate has tobe learnedor taught.  Don'tlet unjustif iedhate blind you to reality. 
 
 
Af ter 64 years of married lif e, Doreen passed away.  T hefuneral director showed us a 
sam ple of the plaquewhich you put on the graves.  Andm y son
 
--
 
we saw sam ples of  i
te m s  
depicting the
 
passing of the particular person,like anairplane or aboat. And m y son 
s u gge s t e
d that a piano
 
--
 
since m y wif e likedm usic very m uch, thata piano would be 
appropriate. So we decided to puta pianoon her side of the plaque.  Now, I am a jackof all 
tradesbutam aster of  none.  I had to wonder 
what 
can I do
.
  
W ell, then itoccurred
 
to  m e  tha t I 
was ver y f ortunate. And thef irst tim e I wentfor a walk with m y f uture wif e, at thattim e 

girlf riend, we were on the beach.  And suddenly she saw a shooting star.  She got all excited 
about it.T hat's when I gave her m y f irst kiss. So then it occurred tom e, since I was ver y 
lucky, I'm  going
 
to
 
take a shooting star and have this as a sym bol onm y plaque. That's what's 
happening. 
 
 
T hat's the end.
