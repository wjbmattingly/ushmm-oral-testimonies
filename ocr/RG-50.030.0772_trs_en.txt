Question: All right, Mr. Œ Mr. 
Hunley
, we™re going to star
t the interview now. 
Answer: Okay. 
Q: It is Friday, the 21
st
 of February, in 2014. Can you state your name, and wh en  
you were born?

Q: Where? 
A: In 
Matthews County
,
 Virginia

Q: And did you grow up th ere? 
A: Grew up there and lived there until I fini

the 
Washington
 area to work, and Œ and 
then worked for the na
vy mo st of my life. 
Q: What was it like growing up there? 

A: Oh boy, you wouldn
™t believe. It™s a Œ 
Matthews County
 is a Œ is 99 square 
miles of delta. The ne-next county, 
Gloucester County
, is full of hills. All the 
topsoil is washed out of 
Matthews
, so in some places the topsoil is 75 feet thick. 
Man, it Œ it-it™s beautiful swamp country, an
d full of Œ of various
 Œ all kinds of wa-
waterways and coves and bays
. And was a marvelous place 
to grow up, to play on 
the water. 
Q: Wha Œ what Œ what did your parents do? 
A: I™m sorry?

Q: What did your parents do? 
A: Well, we had Œ we had a small farm, th
at Œ that belonged Œ come down th rough 

the family. And my father 
was a steam engineer. He went Œ wh ile he was growing 
up, he was, from the time he was 20 years 
old, for a while he 
worked for a lumber 
comp any, and he ran th e steamboat that Œ 
that carried these lu
mber crews back and 
forth. And then when 
the lumb er busin ess dried up, he came to 
Washington
 to 
work. So when I finish
ed high school, I came to wash Œ to Œ to 
Wash ington
, and I 
work ed up here, too. And th en 1950 I star
ted working for the navy, and I worked in 

the ship design office,
 through my career. 

Q: Let™s go back to your
 childhood though. What wo
uld Œ do Œ do you rememb er 
school, do you Œ did y

A: Oh, man. Didn™t Œ didn™t want to miss 
any school. I Œ I walked four miles to

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ from the first grade on. Until I Œ I guess maybe I was a fourth grader, we 
[indecipherable]
 had a school bus used to take it Œ 
take us back an d forth. So  I Œ I 
really Œ I really liked scho
ol, and even now I probably  
[indeciphera ble]
 go running 
off, because I want to go back school agai
n. There™s some things I hadn't learned 
yet.

Q: What were you good at? 
A: In school? 

Q: Yes. 
A: Well, I Œ I did passably at everything, 
and from the ti me I was a b out nine years 
old, I decided I was going to
 be an engineer. So I con
centrated on the things that 
would be the mo st useful to me as an en
gineer. And I got through that pretty good, 
you know, at the 
George Wash ington Un iversity
, and the other Œ well, I wa Œ first 
I Œ the war came along, and I went into the 
army, and I got into 
the army specialized 
training program. And they
 sent me to loyal Œ 
Loyola University 
to study 
engineering. And I got in 
[indecipherable]
 was going fine, and five weeks later 
they closed the school, ever
ybody went in the infantry. 
Q: Oh dear. 
A: So I spent Œ I sp
ent the war in Œ in 
Germany
. And th a Œ tha-that™s how I got the 
wounds of course. And Œ 
Q: Sure. Getting back to your Œ getting ba
ck to your ch ildhood;
 did you play any 
sports, or did you hunt or fi
sh, or do anything like that? 
A: Well, I Œ a lot of hunting and fishing. I 
was in the river every day as soon as I Œ 
as soon as I finished my  schoolwork an
d got home, threw my  books in the house 
and off to Œ to the ri
ver. Down  Œ down  in 
Matthews
, there are two rivers that come

off the bay, and the 
East Riv er
 was about 10 miles long, I lived on th e 
Ea st Riv er
. 
So I had the full run of the 
East River
, with relatives o n  both sides watching, to 
make s Œ make sure that I was doing all right
. And  th at my  mo th er
 knows if I didn™t 
do th ings right. 
Q: Right. 

A: And every Œ I think it was marvelous, and 
there was plenty of woods to hide in, 
and I had a lot of fun with that. And in sc
hool I Œ I Œ I didn™t
 play ball, because 
when  I was about Œ at about six years old, we had a big yard, and all the 

neighborhood came su Œ ever
y Sunday afternoon to play
 ball. And I was batting, 
and my  co usin, who lived next door, and 
was twice my  size and was pitching, and 
he let one fly, hit me smack on the nose. 
And that ended my  ball playing. I didn™t 
play ball after that.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I Œ yeah, I 
Œ yeah, and th en  
[indecipherable]
 try the track team, which came 
in real handy when I got into 
Germany
. I remember one time I was out in the 
middle of about a 600 acre beet
 field, they started firing 
at me with a machine gun, 
and I had to run to get off. Ma
n, those boots were flying. 
Q: I bet. I bet. Whe Œ

started the archery club, and we
 had lot of fun with that. 
Q: And when did y
ou say you came to 
Washington
? 
A: In 1938. 
Q: Okay, so relatively early. 

A: Sorry? 

Q: Relatively early. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Well, I came up in ™38, but then I went 
back to the this Œ I finished high school

 I came up here to stay. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But I Œ in ™38, I came up here to work 
for a while in the su
mmer, and back and Œ 
back for Œ for summers. And th
en after I finished high

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay, fair enough.

volunteer, or were you drafted? 
A: I volunteered, I was Œ 

Q: You volunteered. 

A: Œ that was Œ volunteer. 
Q: What made you came to that decision? 
A: I Œ what made me come to that deci
sion? Well, I knew that everybody had to  
help, and I wanted to do my part. And I wa
nted to Œ at the time 
I wanted to go in to 
the air force, so I enlis
ted for the air force. A
nd th at was great, they 
[indecipherable]
 my enlistment, and all that. An
d then it came time to report for 
active duty. So I went down
 to report for active duty 
[indecipherable]
 and made all 
the oaths and ev erything. And then  they sa
id, oh, we™re sorry, but the air force quota 
is filled for today. So, can™t
 get in the air force. I had 
enlisted for the air force, but 
the air force, it was part of the army. But, 
so they said, since you can™t get in the air

force, if you go over and talk to  those 
folks over there, they™re
 setting up th e army  
specialized trainingprogram,
 and if you pass that exam, they™ll send you to school 
anyhow. So I took th e exams and they sent me off to lo Œ
 Loyola University
, which 
closed in five weeks, and I we
nt off in Œ into the infantry. 
Q: What was the appeal of the air force? Did 
you want to be a pilo
t, or an engineer? 
A: Well, I Œ I really wanted to be an aer
onautical engineer. But I had been  taking an  
air Œ correspondences courses while I was 
going to high school, in aeronautical 
engineering, and I wanted to learn to fl
y, too. But Œ so  I could have a better 
understanding of how th e airplane work ed. 
Q: Right. 
A: But since I th Œ couldn™t get in th
e air force, and they sent me to 
Loyola 
University
, they put me in a mech anical engine
ering program, which I wanted  to do 
anyhow. So I learned Œ I got a degree in 
mechanical engineering, and I work  Œ 
w o rk ed  fo r th e n a vy . In  o rd e
r to get the job I wanted in  the navy, I had to have a 

degree in naval architecture.
 So I went back to the 
University of Michigan 
and 
studied naval architecture. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It Œ it Œ it worked . I got to be Œ got to
 be chief naval architect and Œ chief naval 
architect, and technical director 
for ship design 
for the navy.

Q: Now, when they  went you to 
Loyola
 for school Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ do you understand why th ey shut
 the program down, and sent every Œ 
A: Yes, yes, the war was progressing, and they  really needed troops in 
Europe
 
[indecipherable]
 
Pacific 
too. But it Œ th-the Œ mainly 
Europe
. And the Œ the Œ the 
need for engineers were not overwh elming en
ough to Œ to keep  
the Œ keep  the kids 
in school. 
Q: Where did you go to basic training? 
A: Went through ki Œ 
Camp Roberts
, 
California
. 
Q: When ? 
A: That was in 19 fo r Œ 1943. 
Q: And what was that like, how long were you there? 

A: I Œ well, when  I went 
[indecipherable]
 
Ca mp Ro berts
 for basic, I was 
supposed to go into the Œ th-the 
AFCP
 six weeks basic training. But on the way to 
California
 my records got separated from me, and 
never arrived. So they put me in 
the infantry basic, 17 weeks. Which is the 
best thing that could have happened  to 
me. 
Q: Why? 
A: Because wa Œ when I got into comb
at in the infantry, I needed that. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
11
Q: Yeah. 
A: The Œ the extra Œ extra training, ba
sic training was very valuab le to me. 
Q: How did you find training? Was it diffi
cult, physically, or mentally, or wh at 
have you? 

A: It was all difficult, but not Œ not im
possible, I to Œ I mean, basic training 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yep. 
A: Yeah. No problem with that. 
Q: And was there any Œ was there a particul
ar military field th
at you wanted to  go 
into? 
A: Well, I was Œ I was assigned to
 the infantry, so that was it. 
Q: Right. It™s my  understanding though, th at
 beyond infantry, you were specifically 
selected as a scout sniper. 
A: Yeah, ri Œ I Œ my Œ when I got in Œ we
ll, I went thro ugh th e basic training, and 
made the mistake of being first on the rifle ran g e. And when our 
[indecipherable]
 
boarding the ship going to 
Europe
, somebody walked  up and handed me, and said 
here, here™s your sniper rifle. And I 
became Œ I became a scout Œ scout sniper. 
Q: So there was no Œ was there any sp ecial
ized training specif ically for sniper 

training?  

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
12
A: Just Œ just ma rksma n ship. 
Q: Just mar k smanship. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And do you feel that
 your childhood of hunting help
ed in that regard as well? 
A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: So you were very familia
r, even before basic traini
ng, you were familiar with 
small arms, and Œ 
A: Oh well, tha Œ that time I got into a 
problem, because growing up on a farm, and 
on a river, I had guns from the time I was about
 six, seven years old. And one of my  
favorite sports in the fall was to go down 
to the cove, and shoot the heads off of 
water Œ water moccasins when they Œ they
™d come up in the mating season, you 
know. And I got so that I could hit them pr
etty good. So when I 
Œ when I got in the 
army, I was too good on the rifle r ange, an
d I Œ I pretty well set  Œ set the course. 
Q: After basic traini
ng, where did you go? 
A: Well, I Œ I went to the 
[indecipherable]
 reservation in 
California
, and we were 
on watch for the Japanese. They really we
re afraid the Japanese were going to 
attack the west coast. They had a s
ubmarine come in, I think on either 
Oregon
 or 
Washin gton
, and fire some shells ashore, and they th ought that it was maybe the 
oncoming of another 
Pearl Ha rb or
 attack on th e west coast. So my  division was

scattered along the co ast range
 California
. We sat there for about, I don™t know, six 
months or so , to be there in case anythi
ng happened. Then they decided that my  
division was going to go to 
Europe
, so they shipped me to Œ to 
South Carolina
 for 
mo re training at 
Ca mp Buckner
, and then  shipped me through 
New England
 to Œ 
to Œ to 
France 
and to  
Germany
. 
Q: When did you arrive in 
Europe
? 
A: Ah, let™s see. January 1945. 
Q: Where? 
A: At 
La Havre
. 
Q: Okay, so directly into 
France
. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: And what wi Œ did 
you Œ you were transpor
ted by Œ by troop ship? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. There was a Œ a German
 troop ship , she Œ her Œ her German 
name was the German equivalent of 
[indecipherable]
 and sh e was called 
Alexander B
.
 Hamilton
, in the 
US 
Navy. And she took us over. 
Q: What was the crossing like? 

A: That was in January, and it was cold, a
nd it was rough. Two w
eeks. And I Œ I did 
fine til I went down to 
my Œ to my Œ to the bunkroom. My bunk was on 
G
 d e ck , th e 
lowest one down, right against the fore 
big bulkhead. And so
 you™re up and down

40 feet every Œ every time 
[indecipherable]
. And wh en si Œ to go to Œ to eat, you 
had to go up 
[indecipherable]
 the ladder to the main deck
 and stand Œ get in a line, 
and the Œ the feeding was continuous. The 
line went around all day long, and you™d 
go wa Œ go up, got in th e line,
 went over to eat, and if you felt you might be hungry  
again during the day, you went around tw
ice. Then  back  down  to Œ down  to the 
bunkroom. Well, I went down to th
e bunkroom, that™s o n  my first 
[indeciphera ble]
 
and going down  that ladder, all the way up 
and down , that really fixed it. And when  
I got down there, the whole bunkroom was ab
out that deep, with
 the re-results o f 
the other pe Œ other people™s 
had eaten lunch. Man, that was awful. So immediately 
I got assigned latrine duty, of course, wh
ich was cleaning up the whole place. That 
Œ that made it a very miserable trip.  
Q: I bet. Was it very crowded? 

A: Crowded? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, very crowded. The Œ by the 
[indecipherable]
 before I get down the 
[indecipherable]
 them. There were Œ I think there were Œ think it was 5400 people 
on th e ship. She wasn™t very big. 

Q: Did th e crossing go under escort, or Œ 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

Q: Under escort. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 right around, and dr
opping depth charges, 
and I di Œ I didn™t 
see the Œ the ship get hit by torpedoes, but
 I Œ I know that some were fired while 
were going across. 

Q: Did you make any friends on the way ov
er, or did you have 
any special friends 
before landing in 
Europe
? 
A: Well, the Œ the people that were my fri
ends were the people I went to school 
with. We all got Œ went and got 
[indeciphera ble]
 over the same Œ in Œ in at the 

same time. So the people I we
nt over with were people I 
had gone Œ gone
 to school 
with, and they Œ they  stayed
 with me, long as I was in 
the Œ the division. And of 
course, when we came back, we were get 
Œ we were Œ came back from Œ from the 
war, we were all still in the reserves, and we
 all got called up on the same orders to 
go to  Œ to 
Korea
. And I was working for the navy 
then , and the navy didn™t want 
me to go. I was Œ I was there working on 
sh ip design. So th
ey fought the Œ the 
orders all the way up the 
line and got Œ got me releas
ed from the orders, and I 
stayed and worked for 
the navy. The rest of 
my buddies went to 
Korea
, none of 
them came back. 
Q: Oh dear.

Q: What was your first impressions
 getting off the boat? You™re in 
Euro pe

was that like?  

A: Well, the first impres Œ impression was 
that it needed to warm up a little bit. It 
was January, so th-the Œ the 
fresh goop had melted, and 
when  you stepped in to the 
goop you were up to your knee, and th e ne
xt time you went almo st to your hip. And 
when you pulled your leg up, it weighed a t
on. Bad. I had Œ I had read  about that, 
and I talked to family and friends who 
had been in Wo rld War I, and I knew it Œ 
what it was going to be like. That was really a 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: And now, when  you arrived at 
LaHavre
, your unit did not imme diately go into 
combat Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ there was some Œ what happened in
 betw Œ wh at happened with those tr Œ 
A: Well, we went Œ we did a lot of trai
ning and maneuvers and 
camp ing and all that 
kind of stuff in 
France
, and then  we finally shipped up to Œ to 
Germany
, up 
through 
Belgium
, across 
Luxembourg
, and into 
Germ any
 at 
Trier
. 
Q: Yeah. So, you Œ you still had several 
weeks of Œ of pre-combat training in 
France
.

17
A: Yeah, right. Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: And what was that 
like? Do you Œ do you Œ 
A: Well, same thing I had done before, ha
d tw o or three training sessions in camp s 
in the 
United States
, we just mar ched around and simulating formations, and 
combat formations, and things like 
that. And then o

Q: Take me there. What was that like? Te -Tell me about the entire experience, wa Œ 
A: Well, we took a train thr Œ acro ss 
Luxembourg
, and we got to 
Trier
, we de-
detrained, and from Œ and to
 our Œ our division forma

Q: Yes. And did you have to Œ did you have
 to take out both of
 the Germans, or Œ 
A: Well, by Œ my  squad was somewhere all behi
nd me, so as soon as I fired, th ey all 
joined in. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I got passed that and Œ and went on down  the 
Moselle
. Then I Œ when I got 
down to the 
Rhine
, when we™re crossing the 
Rhine
, I lost my best rifle. I 
[indecipherable]
 these little paddleboats, and I thought
 I was going to be on the left 
hand side of the boat, so I hung my 
[indecipherable]
 my rifle on my right shoulder. 
When I got to the bo
at something happened , and they  
shifted me onto the right side, 
and we™re paddling, trying to dodge all th
e sh ells that were coming in, the rifle 
slipped off, it fell in the 
Rhine
. That was a good one. 
Q: Now that should have been th e 
Rhine
 river crossing, we™re probably 
approaching the end of March. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: At that time, the comb at should have been  picking up a good deal. 
A: Oh, yes, it was thick, and pretty 
rugged. Well, we go Œ we got to the 
Rhine
, I do 
Œ I don™t quite understand th e rationale, but 
they decided that we Œ we Œ we sat on 
the 
Rhin e 
on one side, watching the Germans, 
and they were on th e other side 
watching us for three days. 
Then they decided we coul
d sneak across three o™clock

in the mo rning, they  wouldn™t know we we
re coming. So we got out into the boats, 
and as soon as the first peop
le got in the boats, the Ge
rmans fired tracer ammunition 
into buildings on bo
th sides that were prepared, 
lit the place up like daylight, and 
those were the wooden boats that they can™t 
[indeciphera ble]
 in a hurry. But we 
managed to get across, and ge
t the beachhead, and went on. 
Q: Now, the Œ the main body of the 89
th
 did not cross the 
Rhine
 in boats, they 
crossed on a pontoon bridge 
that was set up afterwards. 
A: Yeah, right, but Œ 
Q: So you were in ve
ry  adv Œ you were in a very advanced unit Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in a very, very for Œ 
A: I was advanced  unit, yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: One of our Œ one of our squads, ma Œ 
my  Œ the Œ th e second Œ I was in the third 
squad of our platoon. The second Œ the firs
t sq uad went across the river first, ab out 
one o™clock in the mo rning, and set up 
[indecipherable]
 along th e beach, along the 
riverbank, to guide the boats that were 
going to be paddling across, bringing us 
across. And they were under the Œ under 
the little seawall, there was a little seawall 
about that high. They were under that s
eawall for two o™clock 
in the morning until

two o™clock in the afternoon befo re we co
uld get to them. And when we got there, 
they had just fired their last round of a
mmunition; they  didn™t lose a man. But there 
were Germans laying all over the place. 
Q: And during that crossing, and after 
the crossing, after you made it over, the 
whole time you were under fire. 
A: Oh yes, yeah, yeah . 

Q: That had to have been Œ 
A: Artillery and rifle fire Œ 
Q: Had to  have been frighten ing. 

A: Œ and machine gun fire too. 
Q: Now, wh en you lost your
 rifle, how did you replace 
your weap on once you made 
it across?  
A: Well, the only weap on I had going 
up east bank of the riv Œ of the 
Rhine
 was a Œ 
an 
[indecipherable]
 doub-double edged kn
ife that my Œ my 
[indecipherable]
 knife 
that my father made for 
me, I wore it in my boot 
[indecipherable]
. And I didn™t get 
Œ I didn™t get a rifle for two days. But I we
 Œ I went up the bank 
on the east side, and 
I™ll Œ they™ll never know how I had got 
there, but I got along bank, and I was 
starting down th e bank, looking fo r a place 
that I could get out 
of the way of this 
rifle fire, and there was laying a Œ a 
M3 Grea se Gun
 machine Œ sub-machine gun,

with two packages of ammun

was. And from then I was the guy that 
opened the doors. R
eally something. 
Q: Now, what Œ 
A: Two day Œ two days later,
 I go Œ I g-got a rifle that the guy didn™t Œ didn™t need 
any more. 
Q: Yeah. He had been killed? 

A: Sorry? 
Q: He had been k
illed, or injured? 
A: Well, he was cul Œ was killed or wounded
 at least Œ well, he wasn™t there any 
more, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, okay. So, going into April Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ I guess you were approaching 
Eisenach
 as you were coming in? 
A: Well, 
Eisenach
, we could 
[indecipherable]
 we went through Œ went thro ugh th e 
town of 
Velmic
(ph), that was Œ that was a little v
illage where we crossed. And then 
we went up the Œ up the 
[indecipherable]
 right up to the top, and w-we started 
going up, and there™s a little Œ a little walki
ng path that went up to the apartment, 
and there was a stream coming down. And I™m going up 
[indecipherable]
 with my 
little sub-machine gun, as first sco u t, going 
up the Œ this little path, and I got Œ get

to the first corner 
and I peek around at 
[indecipherable]
 setting up another machine 
gun. And 
[indeciphera ble]
 with my little 
Grease
 
Gun
. And I didn™t come close to 
hitting him. I me Œ I mean, rocks were flyi
ng everywhere, and they Œ they took off. 
So we got up on top and th
en the Œ the next day we came to a big sugar beet 
country. That was the middle of a Œ I gue
ss maybe a 600 acre shi Œ beet -- beet 
field. And the guy who 
[indecipherable]
 the beet field 
[indecipherable]
 with a Œ 
one of the 
MG-4 2
 machine guns that fire 1200 ro unds a minute. And I™m right in 
the middle of the field. Man, you talk about boots 
[indecipherable]
. I was 
[indecipherable]
 I in the Œ in the track team in school. 
Q: Sure. 
A: But anyhow, I made it over, and dived in
to  the ditch, and su
rvived that one. 
Q: By th is time you™ve had ample opport
unity to see the Germans in action Œ 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: Œ and you in action against them. What 
opinion did you fo rm of the Germans as 
soldiers and as professionals? 

A: Oh, they were good soldiers. But I s
till Œ I can™t Œ can™t really bring my mind 
around to understand why, but in the time th
ere that I was in the lead, and we were 
moving forward, I always saw them first. 

Q: You saw the Germans first? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
25
A: Yeah. 
Q: Before they saw you? 

A: Yeah. I ca Œ I can™t understand how that 
happened, but it did. Cause that day in 
the Œ in the beet field, I saw them befo
re they started shooting at me , but they  
wasn™t a thing I could do, I was right in th e 
middle of this beet field, no place to go. 
But several times I was able to Œ I think 
Œ I think I saved Œ sa
ved a good portion of 
my  Œ of my outfit, by being able to alert them
 to the fact that th
ey were running into 
something th at was going to  be bad.  

Q: So this is March, Apr
il 1945, how old were you? 
A: I was 19. 
Q: Okay. What Œ at that time, M arch, Ap
ril 1945, wh at was your understanding of 
what it was you were fighting for? 
A: I was fighting for 
America
, for the 
United States
. And I™m up Œ my  people 
came here in about 1623, and we grew up in  
Virginia
 and helped  to 
build what the 
united Œ what the 
United States
 is, so it meant a lot to me
. Still does. That™s what I 
was fighting for. 

Q: And was your understanding that wer 
Œ was it your understand
ing that you were 
fighting against the Germans, or
 was it against Nazism, or Œ 
A: Well, I Œ I was face to face with the Germans. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
26
Q: Right. 
A: Nazism was a concept. 
The Germans were people tr
ying Œ trying to kill me.  
Q: Right. So it™s something very personal. 
A: It got pretty personal at
 times. A couple of times wher
e they were to Œ to Œ they 
were 
[indecipherable]
 of several trying to  get me, and that Œ wh at made it pretty 
intense. 
Q: Yes. Now, in very early April, specific
ally  be-between the th
ird and the fo urth of 
April, you™re moving up. Wh
at Œ when  did you arrive 
at Œ what was your first 
approach to 
Ohrdru f
? 
A: Oh, 
Ohrdruf
 was quite Œ quite Œ quite a while la
ter. It was probably Œ let™s see, I 
guess it was maybe three weeks or so over there. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Then there was skirmishes along Œ al
ong the way, and th
en we went to 
Ohrdru f
, 
and of course the Œ the tanks were the fi
rst ones in. We were following the fourth 
armo red division, and the Œ the tanks were 
in there first and they started bringing 
things up, but then th ey Œ we were Œ we 
were right behind them, 
or right with them. 
And I was first through the Œ through the wall 
[indecipherable]
 went in, and 
[indecipherable]

Q: Did you understand what 
Ohrdruf 
was beforehand? Did you understand that 
you were going to Œ 
A: I had no idea it was that til we hit it. 
Q: Okay, so you had no idea. 
A: Mm-mm. 

Q: As you™re marching up, wh -when was Œ di
d you first make sight of it? And what 
was that like? What did you think it was? 
A: Well, the first Œ first tu Œ first day, I was Œ I had a Œ was the 
[indecipherable]
 
started firin g , and we were right along 
with the tanks. And then the Œ it became 
obvious that there were, you know 
[indecipherable]
 on this enclosed area, and the 
Œ it Œ my  infantry get it Œ moved up to mo
ve into the area. And there was a Œ it was 
a Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 and there was a Œ a wire fence 
[indecipherable]
 fence. 
And I went through that. 
Q: What did you think it was?  
A: Well, I didn™t have any idea at first.
 But wer Œ after the fe
nce, stacked in Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 along the fence, was dead bodies of the people that wer Œ that 
they had killed.  

Q: Were you receiving fire on the way in? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
28
A: Not wer Œ not at first. The Œ the Œ the 
guards were pretty well shook up by the 
tanks when they came in. 
Now there™s some Œ  some 
[indecipherable]
 firing, but 
not a real pitched battle. But there were 
Œ some of the German guards were still 
around 
[indecipherable]
 inside the Œ the compound, bu
t they took off pretty quick. 
Q: When  you crossed the wire, and were insi
de the camp, what were the first things 

you started to see? 

A: Well, the Œ first thing I™
d see, of course, were th
ese Œ these bodies stacked 
against the fence. And then I could see th
e bodies laying arou
nd on the Œ on the 
ground, just all over the place. Where Œ wh ere Œ wherever the people Œ the people 

were, they shot them, where-
wherever they were. The only 
ones that were still alive 
were the ones that were smart enough to ge
t down  and pretend that they were dead. 
And there were still q u ite a few that were Œ 
were alive, and as 
we moved in, th-they 
thought that we were Œ you know, the 
Americans moving in, the Germans were 
leaving, some of them started getting up,
 and go Œ got this Œ 
I see so me of them. 
And some of them who were wo unded, and 
some of them were not wounded, but in 

horrible shape, had a Œ they 
were in horrible shape. Th
ey  were beaten and Œ and 
burning up, and sick, and Œ 
and it was just horrible. 
Q: You said the Germans were leaving. 
Were they escaping, or were they Œ 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
29
A: Yes, whatever Œ ever th-th-they Œ well,
 when Œ when they 
re-realized that we 
were moving in , they marched the prisoners 
out fo r 60 miles or so. And of course, a 
lot of them Œ a lot of them died along Œ al
ong the way. Bu t the ones that were left 
were the ones that were too sick to marc
h, and they killed mo
st of those when Œ 
whe-when Œ when we Œ 
when we moved into the Œ there 
Œ they killed most of those, 
and then left. But there 
were still a few alive. 
Q: Did you personally encounter 
any Germans inside the camp? 
A: Not individually, no, mm-mm. I Œ I was 
in Œ in the firefight, but they were 
distant from me, they 
Œ they were not Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ that close up. 
Q: Did you interact with  any of the prisoners? 

A: I Œ well, I didn™t have the language cap
ability to talk to them, but I tried to 
convey the idea that I 
felt sorry for them, and that we 
were Œ we were trying to help. 
And we 
[indecipherable]
 had all kind of help, these 
people were ly ing all Œ all over 
the place, they were still aliv
e, th at couldn™t Œ couldn™t
 move. And dead bodies all 
over the place that need to be
 moved. We bu Œ we buried
 a lot of people. I wasn™t 
involved in the burials myself, because I 
was first line comb at scout, and I had Œ I

had move on. So  I was ha Œ I mo ved out very
 shortly after we got in there. And they 
had Œ lot of people came up behind and to ok 
care of the administrative busin ess. 
Q: When did you come to an understanding of what 
Ohrd ruf 
was, and what the 
purpose of the camp was? 
A: Well, was pr Œ was pretty obvious wh en
 we got to the edge of the camp, you 
could see what it was, right. And I didn™t knew that the Œ the Germans had 

concen tration camps, and war camps. 
Ohrdruf
 was a work camp, it wasn™t Œ they Œ 
they di-didn™t have the Œ th e killer machinery, the ovens 
and all that, but they were 
work ing them to death. And wh en that didn
™t ha Œ fast enough, they beat them up, 
killed them. They had Œ they ha
d clubs to beat them with. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. They were all dead, 
horrible. And I wouldn™t want
 to go back through that 
again. 

Q: Did you understand that many of them
 who were there, many of the prisoners 
were Jewish people? 

A: Oh yes, yeah, I knew th
at, yep. Yep. Very bad. 
Q: How long were you in the camp? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
31
A: About Œ well, actually in the camp, only 
about one day, I was right next to  the 
camp for another day. But I was on th e front
 line, and we were moving, so we had 
moved on out into the forest.  
Q: Did you Œ wa-was there any effort to
 try to provision for the remaining camp  
survivors?  
A: Oh yes, they did that, the 
[indecipherable]
 gave the artillery. Our artillery Œ our 
detachment were the first ones in after us, af
ter the infantry, and they did a lot of the 
cleaning up and taking care of 
the people. And then of cour
se the Œ the other Œ other 
support troops moved in and 
they cleaned up the place, 
and buried the dead, and fed 
the surviv ors and took care of them. But Œ 
and I Œ I had Œ I had to  move on. I was Œ 
I was in front Œ I was scout for the outfit, and I was Œ I was going. 
Q: You said when you entered the 
camp , the bodies were stacked up. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: Were they clothed, or unclothed, wh at Œ 
A: Some of them were clothed, some of th
em were partially clothed, some of them 
were naked.  
Q: Okay . Had they obviously
 been starved and worked? 
A: Oh yes. They  Œ th -they we
re in ha Œ in horrible shape. Some of them had just 
been shot, and they  were so bad off they 
weren™t even bleeding. You could see the Œ 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

32
see the bullet holes with a little blood ar
ound them, but they weren™t Œ weren™t 
actively bleeding. 
Q: Right. 
A: They were Œ they were in
 horrible shape, all Œ they we
re almost d ead. They di Œ 
they were the ones that were
 so Œ so sick that they 
couldn™t Œ they  couldn™t go on 
the forced march, th-they couldn™t
 Œ so they were Œ they were 
[indecipherable]
 
they were treated horribly. Beaten up with 
clubs, and shot and mo st Œ practically all 
of them were shot. 
Q: Is there any way of yo
u estimating how many of Œ 
dead Œ how many o-of th e 
dead people were there, that you saw? 
A: Well, I Œ I Œ I Œ there Œ there were heap
s of them, and I Œ course I didn™t Œ didn™t 
have time to stop and count them, but
 there were hundreds, hundreds. 
Q: And how many Œ how many survivors? 

A: Well, I only say maybe 15 or 20. Maybe 
the Œ thi Œ maybe not even that many. 
They  were stoo Œ standing up and moving. G
od, I Œ I Œ they were
 the only ones that 
I had really Œ well, there were Œ especially
 the ones that were standing up. And in Œ 
most Œ most of them were 
[indecipherable]
 on th e ground either dead or dyin g. 
Q: The ones who were still aliv
e, what Œ did they try to 
interact with you, or anyone 
else in your platoon? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
33
A: Well, yeah, we ha Œ they came runn
ing up to let us know th at they were 
overjoyed that we were there. And we tried 
to Œ tried to talk, but I couldn™t talk to 
them, because they couldn™t Œ they  don
™t Œ couldn™t understand their language. 
Q: Sure. 
A: And most of them were 
Œ were too bad off to do very
 much talking anyhow. But 
they Œ they came up to let us 
Œ let us know that they were
 glad that we were there. 
Q: Both  men and wo men? 
A: I don™t rememb er any women. 
Q: Men, okay. 

A: Just they all Œ all that I remember were men. 
Q: Okay. Very good. 
A: I don™t know if there was women there 
or not, there may have been, but I didn™t 
Œ I don™t rememb er seeing any. 

Q: Did that experience, seeing the camp, s 
Œ and seeing some Œ th-the dead people 
who were Œ who were stacked up, and also
 some of the live people who came and 
tried to Œ to speak with you, did that ch
ange at all, your understanding of the war, 
and why you were fighting it? 
A: Well, it reinforced what I already kn
ew, yeah, I knew Œ I knew Œ I knew what we 
Œ what we were up to, and what we were 
fighting, but it Œ it sure reinforced my 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
34
understanding of it, because 
there were Œ it was just ab
solutely horrible. I just 
finished reading the book called 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Patton
. And one section in it 
they discuss the Œ the Œ the Œ 
Ohrdruf
, and 
Eisenhower
 and 
Patton
 came to s Œ to 
see the place, and they said 
it was so bad, th at it upset 
Patton
 so bad that he went 
off to the side and Œ and lost his lunch. 
[indecipherable]
 
Patton [indecipherable]
 
that™d be a pretty rugged Œ he wasn
™t the type to get all excited.  
Q: And he came several days
 after you were there. 
A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
Q: When  you moved out of th
e camp , where did you go then? 
A: We went down as fast Œ far down into 
Thuring ia
 forest, and right into 
[indecipherable]
 and had Œ there was severa
l firefights going through 
Thuring ia
 
forest. 

Q: What was the fighting like? Could you 
feel German resistance strengthening, or 

weakening? 
A: Well Œ well, I was Œ it was weakening,
 because we were 
gradually wiping out 
the ones that were in there. And I got into 
some pretty Œ pretty fierce set-ons myself. 
At one time Œ one point, we were leaving a unit of the 76
th
 division, and my  platoon 
moved up to relieve one of that platoo
ns, and I walked alongside the platoon 
sergeant, and he stood up. And of course, 
Patton
 required that we wear our insignia 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

on our helmet right there, in gold. Nice and 
fi Œ nice and flashy. So he stood up, and 
when  he stood up, bing, right thro ugh his 
insignia. And the next shot was for me, 
but somehow he missed. I don™t know how, because he had a fine rifle, and a fine 
telescope. But he missed. And I got down  be
hind a spruce tree about that big. And 
he shot a group just where I™d be, though th
e Œ his first tree, about this wide, he had 
about like that. And he wa Œ he sees Œ he sa
w some part of me, I guess that Œ that he 
thought, or at least he thought he did, 
and he was shooting at, 
and he Œ and he had 
put right in there. He was shooting one 
of their Œ I ca Œ I can™t remember the 
designation 
[indecipherable]
 10 shot semi-automatic Œ automatic rifles, that they 
designed and built to counter the 
M-1
 rifle. And it was a very fine rifle, and he had 
a Œ a bi Œ a b Œ a beau tiful telescope on it. I 
[indeciphera ble]
 telescope 
[indecipherable] 
and he™s still using it. 
Q: So you Œ you engaged that Germ
an Œ you Œ you had to kill him. 
A: I Œ I didn™t kill him, I 
[indecipherable]
 the Œ I had two Œ I had a Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 on both sides of me. And 
[indeciphera ble]
 and when I got down 
behind a tree, and he was Œ he was Œ he ha
d me st Œ stuck, I couldn™t move. And 
they could hear him 
[indecipherable]
 they didn™t stop shootin
g at me. So I went up 
and got his Œ got his rifle, and took th
e scope off, and sent the scope home to 
[indecipherable]
 my  scope.

Q: So that was your first experience of 
Europe
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What did you think of it, in
 terms of the terrain, the land? 
A: Oh, it was beautiful. 
Germany
 was just gorgeous. I thou
 Œ I remember when I 
was going across southern 
Germany
, I couldn™t understand why people from places 
as beautiful as that would be 
[indecipherable]
 to take Œ take somebody else™s land. 
It was a 
[in d ecipherable]
 a hilly country, all beautiful
 green farms, there™s little 
villages on top of the hills, 
little white villages on top of
 the hills, and it was just 
beautiful scenery.

we™d come to a home 
[indeciphera ble]
 baking. And ab solutely beautiful breads and 
cakes, and all kinds of stu
ff. And when we come through
, the Œ the ladies of the 
household would trot out the 
baked goods for us to sample, and man, oh boy it was 
good. And the Œ the Œ in  the Œ in  
Germany
, southern 
Germany
, most of the 
civilians that I ran into were
 not too Œ not too ba
d to Œ to talk to 
or get along with. 
When we got into 
Austria
, man they were the most vi
cious ones that I ran into. 
Right in 
Salzburg
. 
Q: In Œ in what way? 
A: Well, the ones in 
Germany
 would Œ would talk to us, 
and they  would ju st talk 
about, you know, just 
the average whatever 
you talk about. In 
Austria
, as soon as 
you 
[indecipherable]
 was around 
Salzburg
 that this, you know, what Œ what we 
were doing to them, taking aw
ay  their radios, taking aw ay all this and that kinds of 
stuff. They didn™t have any 
of the stuff that they shou
ld have, because we were 
taking it all away. And what they had, was h
ouses with six or eight rooms, some of 
them, with one room solid full 
packed with silverware that
 they got -- looted out of 
France
 and other countries th
at th ey™d taken over. I 
[indecipherable]
 they had a 
room full of Œ of plate and Œ and tabl
eware, and all kinds of hou Œ silver 
[indecipherable]
. All that kind of stu ff just stacked
 up. Crazy. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

39
A: And they were very, very
 perturbed because we were
 taking aw ay  their stuff. 
Their stuff. Man. 
Q: Was there Œ was there ever a point in 
the war that came, where you Œ where you 
thought for yourself, we™re winning this, 
we-we™re Œ we™re Œ this is going to  end 
soon? 

A: I thought that right from the beginning. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. I mean I Œ in 
France
, soon as we got ashore and 
started moving, we were 
pushing them back. This Ba
ttle of the Bulge was sort 
[indecipherable]
. I was off on 
the right hand side of that in Œ in 
France
, but we were Œ obviously had them on the 
Œ on the 
[indecipherable]
 along.  
Q: Were you engaged in the Battle of th
e Bulge, or to Œ 
off on the flank? 
A: Yeah, I was Œ I Œ I was not in the Battle of the Bulge. 
Q: Right. 
A: I was off on the side. 
Q: Right. 

A: And Œ but I went up too far to that, af ter the Œ the actual Battle of the Bulge was

A: But, very interesting experience. 
Q: Was there ever a Œ a sense Œ was there 
Œ di Œ wer Œ did there come a time where 
you could sense that the German war machine was slowing down ? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: That there weren™t being Œ when was that time? 

A: Oh, we™re actually acro
ss the Œ actually across the 
Rhine
, they definitely 
[indecipherable]
 slowing Œ slowing down . And th
e troops there who were Œ who 
we were battling, were becoming less and 
less efficient. Wh
en we crossed the 
Rhine
, the Œ the troops that we 
were battling were from around 
Salzburg
, and they 
were the Œ the Ho me Guard type. And they
 were not Œ not as proficient as the 
soldiers we fought a
ll up Œ up through the 
Rhine
. 
Q: Right. 

A: Some of them were ve
ry poor shots. That™s th
e reason I™m still here. Thank 
heavens for that, but a lot of them were ol
der, and they  were not the Œ not as Œ not 
the top notch  soldiers that we fought 
[indecipherable]
 across the 
Rhine
. But that 
was 
[indecipherable]
 where we ran into 
SS
 troops, and people 
were very topnotch 
soldiers. And at the end, when we 
were Œ when we wound up at Œ at 
La ng enba ch
, 
we were getting ready for another push on the 
fifth of Œ fifth of March, I think, we 
Œ 
fifth of April Œ fifth of May, we were
 having another push into sh  Œ in to 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
41
Czechoslovakia
, and there was a whole Œ I don™t 
know how the arrangement is of 
SS
 troops, and the other t-topnotch troops
 that had been  di
gging in and getting 
ready. And we were p-p-pushing off agains
t them. But that woul
d have been Œ that 
would have been a horrible battle. But just 
the Œ the Œ we lined Œ we lined up th-the 
Œ the Œ the infantry lined up 
in battle formatio n, the trucks started their engines, the 
tanks started their engines. And just as 
we started following, the word  came down 
the war was over. Happy day. 
Q: So what ha Œ wh at happ
ened then? What ha
pp en ed  w h en  th e 
word came over Œ 
A: Everybody shot everything they  had into th e air. 
Q: And what was the reaction on the 
opposite side, on the German side? 
A: Well, I-I don™t know what Œ what went
 on over there, but there Œ there was no Œ 

there was no battle or anything like that. 

Q: Right. 

A: They Œ they initially Œ th
ey di Œ they didn™t just 
immediately dissolve and go 
away. Bu t th-they started coming in  and Œ an
d Œ and, I mean ha Œ by the thousands. 
Q: Surrendering. 

A: Surrendering, yeah , mm-hm. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

Q: What was that experience like? We
re they Œ these me
n who you had been 
fighting against for some time now, all ar
e coming to wards you, presumably with 
their hands up su rrendering. Wh at wa Œ that
 mu st have been an odd experience. 
A: Very odd. And ye-ye Œ cour
se th Œ y-you didn™t Œ ye 
Œ we had no idea wh ether Œ 
whether we could trust them or not, you 
know? Th-That Œ they were pretty sneaky 
at lots of things, and it was a sort of 
a hard experience to 
stand there and watch 
them come out, you know, thousands of 
them, but just a Œ a few of us. And 
[indecipherable]
 weap ons, they could have 
[indecipherable]
 us up pretty good. 
But it 
[indecipherable]
 surrender, they were 
Œ that™s all good. 
Q: How long did that take? How long di
d it take before Œ for all of the Œ the 
German units to start surrendering to you?
 Wh at was Œ that process take a day, a 
few days, a Œ 

A: Well, it took a few days. There Œ there wa
s Œ they were also Œ course, behind the 
German front lines, it di Œ di Œ took a few da
ys before they acquie
sced to Œ to come 
in. 

Q: Even after you said, okay, that you un
derstood the war was over, at that point 
when the war was over, were there every 
incidents of still receiving fire from the 
German side?

surrendered and it Œ there were some si Œ local fights, but I wa Œ I wasn™t Œ I was 
not in any of them.  
Q: Okay . And when  the Germ
ans came to surrender, what
 did you do with them?  
A: Oh, th ey just pass them on back, and they  Œ they had 
[indecipherable]
 times, 
and I wi Œ I didn™t Œ I didn™t see any 
[indecipherable]
 they were behind me. But th 
Œ the Œ th ey 
[indecipherable]
 been Œ been ju st miles for troops marching. Lots of 
them. 

Q: Where did you go, once the war was ove
r, what then happen

to the 89

 division? Where did you 
go, where did you st Œ 
A: Well, we went to 
Austria
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And we were in Œ in  duty in  
Austria
 for about a year. And th

division was dissolved, and we came home. 

Q: What did your duty in 
Austria
 consist of? What did you do there? 
A: Well, I Œ there were mostly was just

uniform. Sometimes we

very much to do, just
 Œ just a matter of 
just staying there.

build ing. And th ey Œ we all were very co
mfortably housed, and everythi-every thing 
went fine, but there was nothing to  do except to stay there. 

Q: And Œ but you were still in

a little bit of the 
Matthews County 
brogue, you know, in we Œ 
my  family moved to  
Virginia
 in the 1620s, and they
 brought with
 them the 
Elizabethan English, and 
Matthews County
 is very isolated. Practically all the 
traffic in until Œ until I was born, 
practically all the traffic into 
Matthews County
 
was by boat, so there wasn™t much traffic 
in and out. And the la
nguage tended to be 
preserved. The men who work ed on sh ips, 
they went all over and they Œ gradually 
the men™s language changed. The wome
n™s language stayed pretty mu ch 
Elizabethan. When I was ki
d they still used something 
very close to Elizabethan 
English. I had a lot of that Œ a lot of 
[indecipherable]
. And this Œ thi-this Œ so I still 

had a lot of that. So when I went to college

speak the language. You gotta go 
talk to 
Bill

rowboat, and I Œ we listening to the concert down at the 
Watergate
 in 
Washington
. 
And I got a little romantic, proposed to her, 
give her my fraternity pin and all that.

Potomac River
, and that™s when 
you decided? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What year was that? 

A: Well, I had decided befo re that, but that
™s the first time I told her about it.  
Q: So sh e got your pi
n rather than a ring. 
A: Yeah. Got a ring later. 

Q: And she agreed straightaway, or
 did she put you off for a while? 
A: Well, she put me off for a while. Took a little while to convince her.  
Q: When  did she finally come ‚round? 
A: Well, it was Œ it was almo st 1950. We we
re married in 1950.
 August 1950. Sep Œ 
September 1950. So it took 
a little while to convince he
r that everything was going 
to be all right. 

Q: And did you have 
children straightaway ?

A: Sorry? 
Q: Did you have children straight
away? Immediately have children? 
A: Well, our first Œ our first child was bor
n in ™55. So  we didn™t have any right 
away. And had the daughter in
 ™5 5, and another one in ™5
8. Boy. Lots of memo ries 
coming back. 

Q: Sure. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And where were you living when y
ou Œ wh ere did you make your fami ly? 
A: Well, I Œ I was living in 
Wa shington
, working for the navy when we got 
married, and then we re
nted an apartment in 
Washin gton
, and then after a few 
months we bought a house close to the 
apartment. And then we moved back to 
Virginia
 wh en ev erybody Œ wh en we decided to
 have ch ildren, we moved back to 
Virginia
, to get to Œ to a mo re congenial neig
hborhood, and be able to get to the 
schools easier. 

Q: Where in 
Virgin ia
 did you go? 
A: I went to 
Alexandria
, in the 
Monticello Park
 area.  
Q: Okay, bri Œ I know that area. 

A: Yeah, it™s pretty nice. 
Q: Mm-hm. How many years did you stay there? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
55
A: Fifty-one. 
Q: Fifty-one year, a long time. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Very long time. 
A: Yeah, the kids grew up there, they really
 Œ they loved it. They
 Œ they Œ we Œ we 
were on 
Argyle Driv e
, which is a short street with a 
cul-de-sac at the end. It™s only 
one blo Œ one block, and th en a cu l-de-sac.
 And the whole neighborhood was full of 
Œ full of kids when  mine were coming along. And so ver Œ the kids were all up and 

down  the street all day, everything ver-v
er-very nice. Wonderful. And a good Œ th e 

Œ the parent dig Œ th e parents all right, very
 good neighbors. Nice place to live. But 
Œ 

Q: And you said Œ how long did you Œ how
 many years did you wo rk fo r the navy? 
A: Thirty years. 

Q: Thirty years. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: And as a Œ and your offici
al jo b title when you retired? 
A: When I retired I was chief naval arch
itect, and te-technical director for ship 
designs for the navy. 

Q: And what year was that? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
56
A: That was 1980. 
Q: 1980? Okay. 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: So all the way Œ you 
were designing sh ips from Œ 
A: 1950 to 1980, and 
then after I retired, I still desi
gned sh ips for another 30 years. 
Q: What sorts? What kind of ships? 
A: Oh well, I Œ I did quite a bit of de Œ 
the design wo rk fo r the navy under contract. 
And I designed a few 
[indeciphera ble]
 vessels, some smalle
r vessels, 40 Œ 40 Œ 45 
foot wo rk  boats and fishing boats, th
ings like that. And I designed the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 for the alexan Œ 
Alexandria Seaport Foundation
. 
Q: Right. 

A: After I retired, I Œ I joined the 
Alexandria Seaport Founda tion
, and in ‚92 I 
became chairman of the 
Seaport Founda tion
. And at that time we had the old 
schooner,
 Alexandria
, 125 foot 
[indecipherable]
 schooner. And I started a 
boatbuild ing school to ha-hav
e something for the kids at 
Alexandria
 and 
Washin gton Œ 
who l e 
Washin gton 
area to do. And we Œ we Œ it really took off, I 
was amazed at that. You know, wh-when I we
nt to set it up, I talked to the city 
council, and they weren™t very
 interested. I w ent and talked
 to the school board, ah, 
you™re wasting your time, they said, your 
kids don™t want to do anything like that, 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
57
they want to play in the streets and all.
 But I Œ I persisted and I got the school 
started in 1992, and I started off with a Œ 
a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 
years old, and had a group 
of neighborhood supporters that would support them. 
And they all came in and we split them up into
 groups of five kids
, with at least one 
adult with each group, so th
at they had some good supervision. I started them 
building little wooden boats. And I Œ we foun
d that boy, when Œ when a lot of Œ 
mo st of those kids Œ mo st of them when  
they came, they were
 Œ boats didn™t mean 
anything at all to them. And doing anything
 with their hands di
dn™t mean to them. 
They  didn™t di Œ they ™d never done anything
. But when they came
 in to us, about a 
week of working on a little boat that was going
 to be theirs when
 they finished, as 
long as they could actually do something, 
man, the effect was amazing. So that™s 
gone on since ™92 and it just kept on gr
owing, it™s national now. A-As our system 
that we developed has been spread  all 
over the country , and now a hundred, 185 
organizations in the country  that use our 
system, teaching kids to build little wooden 
boats. The little wooden boat is Œ is the key to
 it. They come in, and they get started 
with hammer and Œ and chisels and saws, th
ings they  had never touched before, and 

they learn to use those things, and they st
art building a little boat that they can see, I 
can do something that™s going to 
last and will be good for me Œ 
Q: Sure. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
58
A: And that Œ it really gets
 them. Works very 
good. Then, a-after we got that going 
good, we started adding classroom exerci
ses to help them with their schoolwork, 
and now we teach mathematic
s and physics and hi-history
, and a couple of other 
courses occasionally, for the kids that are in
 high school and ha
ve trouble with a Œ 
with the high school. They don™t
 do well in Œ in math, a lot 
of the Œ a lot of the boys 
particularly don™t do well in math b
ecause they™re sitting there working on 
mathematical problems that don™t relate to
 anything. They can™t see any Œ any sense 
in it at all b ecause it doesn™t Œ doesn™t rela
te to the things they
 do. But when they 
come in, we start teaching them to us
e mathematics to lay out the boats and 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind of stuff, and they
 see the use for it, it makes a big 
difference. 
Q: I bet. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Your Œ after the war was 
over, you had a long life, very long, a good long time 
after the war. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did your experiences during the war bothe
r you? Do  you they  come back to you 
later on? 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
59
A: Oh yeah, it came Œ it came
 back to me constantly. When I first got home, if a car 
Œ car go down the street backfire, I™d wake
 up under the bed. But I gradually got 
over that, and it Œ it Œ it didn™t bother me 
so much as it, yo
u know, changed my  
outlook a lot. 
Q: In what way? 

A: Well, one thing, I was Œ th-the group that I was with were practically all 

volunteers, enlistees Œ enlistees
, and of course, the Œ the Œ 
the main Œ main body at 
the World War II army was draftees. A
nd I found that the people who went 
voluntarily, they were Œ had a slightly di
fferent outlook on th ings
, and I Œ I Œ I was 
glad that I had en listed and gone voluntarily 
[indecipherable]
 what I had to do. 
Q: Can you talk about that
 a little bit? In what way 
wa Œ in what way was it 
different? Was there a sense of professiona
lism, or was wa Œ how was it different 
between Œ 

A: Well, yeah, professionalism, and in 
the way that indu Œ 
individ-individuals 
reacted with each other, the 
ones who had enlisted tended to
 be more interactive and 
worked together better 
than the ones that were drafted.
 That Œ that wasn™t Œ I mean 
[indecipherable]
 not the across the board
 th ing, wa Œ everybod
y was still different. 
But the Œ the Œ overall, the Œ the Œ the peopl
e that I knew that were enlistees ten d ed 
to, I thought, be a little bit eas
ier to Œ to Œ to 
work with, and get 
things done. A lot 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
60
of the Œ a lot of the draftees, some of 
them that I knew personally, were just, you 
know, absolutely overwr
ought with having been drafted.
 They  wanted nothing to do 
with it, and that Œ that in
fluenced  everything they did. The ones that Œ that 
volunteered knew wh at they we
re going Œ going to  do, and th
-they Œ they tended to 
respond a little differen tly. 
Q: Sure. You said when th
e Korean War broke out, th
ere was an effort to re-
mobilize you? 
A: Well, when the Korean War broke
 out, I Œ I was already demobilized 
[indecipherable]
 to the navy. And they 
Œ they started calling up the reserves ag ain, 
and I got called up. The first sheet of orders
 that I got included me, and mo st of the 

people that had been in my immediate 
organization in World War II. And the navy 
[indecipherable]
 back to them. They didn™t want
 me to go, because I was working 
on a ship design business, and so they mana
ged to the Œ get the orders Œ pre Œ get 
me off the orders. And that amazed me too,
 because th-they have to track it up unit 
by unit. They first tried the unit that I wa
s assigned to , were tu rned down, and the 
next 
[indecipherable]
 they took it to the office of 
the president to get me released. 
As I 
[indecipherable]
 that really amazed me because I hadn't been at Œ I hadn 't  
been at the navy very long
. But apparently they Œ they
 had something th ey wanted 
me to do, so I stayed on and 
became chief naval architect.

Q: And Œ but you did not 
initiate that process Œ 
A: No, no. 
Q: Œ that was initiated by the navy. 
A: I Œ I Œ I went in Œ wh en Œ wh en
 I got th Œ when I got my orders 
[indeciphera ble]
 
got my  orders 
[indecipherable]
 got married, and I had al
ready taken two weeks off. 
And wh en I went back  in after two Œ tw
o weeks after I got my  orders Œ course, 
when  I got my  orders, I had to notify th
e office. And when  I went back in two 
weeks later to pick up my b
ooks and th i Œ draw ing tools 
[indecipherable]
 from the 
office, and I was leaving to  go report to dut
y, and the Œ th-the Œ th e assistant chief 
naval architect at that time, came 
running down th e aisle, said hey, 
Bill
, hey 
Bill
, 
you don™t have to go. Ma
n, was that good news. 
Q: I bet. 
A: Oh boy. Cause th-the Œ th
e Œ the group of my  Œ on my
 orders that went, didn™t 
come back. 
Q: No. 
A: None of them. 

Q: I™m curious, by this time that you™ve 
had a few university degrees and wh at Œ 
were they trying to remobilize you as 
an enlisted man, or as an officer?  
A: Well, I was Œ I was a 
PFC 
in the Œ in reserves. 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
62
Q: Okay . 
A: I had been offered officer
 training school before I was demobilized, but I Œ I 
didn™t Œ I didn™t want to take that as 
a career, I wanted to be an engineer. 
Q: Right. 

A: So Œ but I was called Œ I was called up as 
a first Œ first class private. First class, 
too. 

Q: How old were you at that time? 
A: Sorry? 
Q: How old were you at that time? 

A: Let™s see, that Œ that was in 1946, I was Œ hm, 20 - 22. 
Q: When did you decide to leave 
Alexandria
 and live where you are now? 
A: Well, I Œ well, I always said, living in 
Alexandria
, we became interested in this 
old little village of 
Waterford
 up in 
Loudoun
 
Co unty
. You know
 Waterford
? 
Q: Yes. 

A: They have a very won Œ they had a w
onderful Œ well, they still have a wonderful 
annual event where they have
 the old homes tour and col
onial craft exhibits. I was 
very interested in Œ in the colonial cr
afts. I trava Œ I™m a gunsmith and make 

furniture, and all that kind of
 stuff. So I used to go to 
Wa terfo r d
 and go Œ go there 
for the fair every year, and 
got to work ing with some of
 the craftsman up there on 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014

different things. So I Œ we got 
Œ both of us got so interest
ed in it that we watched for 
a Œ a lot that we could buy, we were l
ooking fo r a house, really. But we Œ none of 
the houses came up for sale th
at we could Œ could ha Œ 
could handle. So a lot came 
up for sale, so we bought the 
lot, 1968, and then we star
ted drawing back Œ I started 
making designs for houses
. And, of course, in 
Wa terford
 they had all Œ had all 
kinds of restrictions on what you could bu
ild because they wanted
 to keep the tenor 
of the village. So I designed 
what I thought was a real 
[in d ecipherable]
 house, and 
I took it to the 
[indecipherable]
 took it to the Œ the 
architect who was the 
[indecipherable]
 on what you could bu
ild. Showed it to him, 
he said, oh, that™s a 
nice little h ouse
 Bill
, but that Œ that™s Œ that
 would lo ok beautiful in 
Lancaster 
County
, 
Pennsylvania
, but that™s not for 
Waterford
. So I went back, and I 
designed a brick house. Oh, he said, man, 
Williamsburg
. Beautiful 
Williamsburg
 
house. Not for 
Waterford
. So about that time, my wife was reading 
[indecipherable]
 the ﬁ
Washington Post
,ﬂ and at the bottom end of the classified 
ads was, log house for sale. They were te
aring down a log house because they built 
Œ had new houses all around it, they Œ they
 couldn™t do anything 
except tear Œ tear 
down  and move it. So we went over Œ she 
said, let™s go over and take a look at it. 
Well, that was the first week in May, 19
70. And I said, oh, I™m too busy, I can™t 
take Œ make it. So next week she tried 
again. The house was still for sale. Third 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014 
 

 
 
64
week, still for sale, tried again. The fourth
 week, Sunday Œ Sund
ay afternoon, it was 
raining cats and dogs, the kids
 were grumpy as all get out
. Said okay, let™s take the 
kids over, we™ll go look at it. So we went 
over and there™s this log house. By  that 
time they™d taken the roof o
ff, and it was raining for all w
eek, and water dripping on 
everything. We opened the back  door, and th
e inside of the house had been lone Œ 
had been lined with 
[indeciphera ble]
 board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, 
insulating board? And when  we open
ed  the back door there was enough 
[indecipherable]
 that the whole ceiling collapsed, 
and two tons of water and all 
frazzly wood came down. But it opened up ev erything so I could see all the logs. 
And it was in good shape. Only two logs n
eeded some Œ some moderate repairs. So 
right there we bought the log house, and we 
[indeciphera ble]
 hire a guy to haul the 
logs over to our lot to 
Waterford
 so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up 
the logs, he says, hey, you 
know, my father™s got a log 
house three miles over there, 
that he hasn™t used for 10 years, he™d prob
ably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So 
[indecipherable]
 that was very reasonable, so I bought that and th ey moved both of 
them over, and we combined the two 
of them to make one house in 
Waterford
. 
And we finished it 
[indecipherable]
 lived in it to the poin
t where we lived in it 
about 1975. And we had Œ 
still had floors missing, 
and no doors or windows 
installed, things like that, but we moved in in
 time for the kids to 
go to school in the 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley  
 
February 21, 2014

fall, and then I built it up from the inside. 
So that™s how Œ that™s how we got into 
that. 

Q: Very nice. 
A: And it™s be-been nice, I really Œ really 
had a good time there. I still live in Œ still 
live in there. 
Q: Yeah. Is your Œ is your wife still with us? 

A: No, she died in
 ni Œ in 2003. 
Q: I™m sorry. 

A: But she enjoyed the house as l
ong as she was there. She liked it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I was planning on building a boat, I ha
d Œ had Œ had a design along the way for a 
36 footer. But she wasn™t rea
lly too keen on a boat. So  sh
e saw this old house thing, 
and she says, why 
Bill
, you™re Œ you™re really interested in all this colonial 
craftsmanship and stuff, you™d di Œ you™d 
like this log house. We ought to Œ we 
ought to go look at that. I put  her off for a month, just Œ 
when I went to look at it, 
she finally got me. So I ne
ver Œ never built my boat. 
Q: No. Now, I™m sorry, bu
t going back to the war Œ 
A: Yeah.

Q: Œ there are people today, not
 only in the world, but in
 this country, who say and 
who claim that the Holo
caust never happened . 
A: Oh gad. Can you imagine peop
le as stupid as that? I can™t. 
Q: Now what Œ 
A: A-A-And that™s not Œ I 
understand what you™re sa
ying, but th-that™s just 

absolutely insane. I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ that just
 Œ I just can™t come up with  any Œ anything 
to explain that. 
Q: What would you say to those people? 
A: Well, I™ve never run across one of them
, but I Œ I sure I would come up with 

some proper things to say. 
Q: Yes. 
A: I was there. I was in the original play
. I c Œ I can read you script line by line. 
Man, some of the places that I saw  were raps Œ just Œ just Œ it™s unbelievably 

horrible. And how Œ how a nation
 could do that, I don™t know. 
Q: Did it change the way you 
felt about th e German people? 

A: Well, yes, of course. I Œ I didn™t kn
ow mu ch  about the German people pu Œ 
before. I have some Œ I Œ I have a very 
extensive family, my 
people who were in 
Virginia  
by
 Œ 
by 1623, and so we became 
[indecipherable]
 a lot of them came 
from 
Germany
. Bu t none of the German people th
at I Œ that I knew had any Œ a-any 

 
Interview with WilliamHunley

67
i-indication of anything like that. I don™t kn ow Œ I just can™t understand ho-how that 
could develop. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But on th e other hand, the Germans have 
a history of that, that there have been 
battles from Œ from way back, all 
the way fromthe beginning. 
Q: Did you ever return to 
Euro pe
 after the war? 
A: Oh yeah. I™ve 
been back to 
Germany
 tho Œ about six times. I used to go to 
England
 frequently because I Œ and 
France
 because I was chief naval architect for 
the navy, and I was involved in naval design programs for the British, Canadians, 
and the 
[indecipherable]
 the Australians. S o  I us
ed to visit them all. 
Q: Why 
Germany
? Why did you go back to  
Germany
? 
A: Well, I Œ I went back Œ 
I-I wanted to go back
 and trace th Œ follow my trace Œ the 
Œ my wartime trace from 
Germany
. I went back four times to try that and never got 
to do it. I took my  family with me, and we
™d  always run across something that they 
liked so much they di
dn™t want to leave. So I never 
got to go back and trace that 
trail again. 
Q: And what di Œ do Œ so yo
u Œ were you trav eling by car? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah, mm-hm.

A: Yeah. 
Q: And when Œ when  was that? When  Œ what Œ 

A: Well, let™s see, yeah, we went in Œ boy, 
let™s see. In Œ in th
e 60s and 70s, it was Œ 
our da-daughters went with us. And before th
at I was too busy w
ith Œ with the navy. 
But in 60s and 70s, and 
we went back once in  the 80s. We went to 
France
 Œ in the 
80s we went to 
France
, but instead of going to  Œ to 
Trier
, then going down to 
Moselle
, or down across the 
Rhine
, and follow my tracks, wh
en we got to fr Œ to 
France
, we rented a car in 
Paris
, and we drove up to where we go in to 
Germ any
, 
and man it was gorgeous there. And th
e weather was beautiful, and so we 
[indecipherable]
 to 
Germany
. I Œ I still would like to go back, but I don™t think I 
can do it now. 

Q: Going back to 
Germ any
 th en, how, if at all, did 
both the country as well as the 
German people change? 

A: Well, of course the Œ wh en th e war wa
s over, the Œ the people changed pretty 
rapidly. And I Œ I became a Œ a pretty good 
[indeciphera ble]
 with a lot of them 
aster Œ after the war. Used to correspond 
with some of them, and course you never 
can tell what they™re actually
 thinking, but what they 
said was quite different. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah.

 was a vicious nation. Ho rrible. I™m glad 
that™s over. 

Q: We™re making this recording, this
 recording will go in
to our archives. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: It™ll be used by histor
ians and scholars, and people who study not only th e war, 
but the Holocaust in particular. 

A: Yeah. Mm-hm. 

Q: Do you have anythi
ng in  closing that y
ou would like to say? 
A: Well, no, can™t think of 
anything we haven™t already 
covered. And I™ve lived a 
long life, and I™ve done a lot of things, so 
I could talk on and on for the rest of my 
life, probably, and never stop,
 but it probably wouldn™t be
