Abstract 
 
 Hanna Liebma nn was born Hannah Hirsh in 
Karlsruhe, Germany on 
November 28, 1924.  Her 
father Max, a successful photographer, died within 
12 weeks after her birth. Hanna, her older brother, 
and mother lived in a very comfortable home. 
Ha nna went to public school, where Jews  were 
harassed. In 1936, she was forced to transfer to th
e Jewish school which had opened in September, 
and was shared with me ntally retarded students. 
On the day of Kristallnacht, the showcases in 
Hanna™s home  were smashed, all 
Jewish me n were arrested, and 
the conservative synagogue was 
burned. Hanna was sent to a board
ing school near Hanover where she stayed until August 1940 when 
her mother ma de her return after the mother™s arm became so inflamed that she couldn™t move it. 
Hanna™s brother had moved to Amer ica. On Oc
tober 22, 1940, 12 me n arrest
ed Hanna, aged 16, her 
mother, three aunts, and 91-and-a-half year-old gr
andmother at the home they shared. They were on 
one of nine trains that took thr
ee days to arrive in Oloron Sain
te-Marie. At Oloron Sainte-Marie, 
Hanna and her family we re sent to the Gurs 
camp. The camp had mud knee-deep, raging dysentery, 
but a ﬁtreme ndous cultural lifeﬂ including chambermusic and cabaret. Hanna worked in the camp™ s 
office where she me t her future husband. Swiss Red Cr
oss provided some  food. A social worker asked 
Hanna™s mo ther to allow her to go to the vi
llage Le  Chambon- sur-Lignon where young people were 
helped to survive. After about 11 mo nths in 
Gurs, Hanna left in September 1941 for Le Chambon. 
When Ger mans came to Le Cha mbon, Hanna was hi
dden by various people, including far mers who 
built a hiding place in woodpiles. In February 
1943, she ma de her way alone to Switzerland. She 
contacted an aunt, and lived with the fa mily un
til late December 1944. Hanna ran away because the 
fa mily could not understand what she had been
 through, and Hanna came  close to a nervous 
breakdown. She ma de her way to Geneva where she 
reconnected with her future husband, and worked 
as a ma id. They had a daughter, and rema ined in
 Switzerland until 1948 when the Swiss declined to 
let them stay. They immi grated to the United 
States in 1948. Also after the war, Hanna™s two 
surviving aunts immi grated to C
uba, and then to the United States
. Five family me mbers survived, 
including two cousins who were deported from Pra
gue to Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, and labor 
camps. Four teen family me mbers died. She concluded, 
ﬁin spite of it all, life
 has been good to us.ﬂ

Tape I, Side A 
 
Anthony: 
Today is March 28, 1992. My name  is Anthony Di
 Iorio and I am at the home of Mrs. 
Hanna Liebma nn, Bayside, New York. I am here to 
interview her about her experiences and those of 
her family during the Holocaust. Good evening. 
 
Hanna:
 Good evening, Tony. I am Hanna Liebma nn. I 
was born on November 28, 1924 in Karlsruhe, 
Germany as the second child of Max and Ella Hirsh n
ee Traub. I had an older brother. My father died 
within 12 weeks after my birth which left  my mother 
a widow. She raised us very well. My father was 
in business, he was a photographer.
 He started his business in 1901. 
He was then 21 years old with 
this younger brother who was twenty and not yet of 
age and couldn't put his signature on any business 
papers. Within a year my  father had acquired a title as 
hufphotograph
, grand-duke of Baden and, of 
course, subsequently to other small courts and what
 have-you. At the time 
he opened his business in 
1901, he was actually despised by the 
rest of the Jewish population in 
Karlsruhe for going into such a 
profession because no Jew had ever done that before
. A year later, when he had become  known a nd 
had ma de his reputation, he was th
e darling of the town. It™s true. 
 
Anthony:
 Jewish and non-Jewish? 
 

Hanna:
 Right. So– 
 

Anthony:
 He was the Grand-Duke of Court. 
 
Hanna:
 Grand-Duke of Court, right. In any case, we grew up in 
Germany in a very comfortable 
home . It is true that we grew up without a father
; our mother was a very good mother. She continued 
to run the business and did so till 1938, December  31 when we had to give up the business due to the 
laws in Germany. I started school, I believe, in 1930, 
I'm not quite sure of this anymore. I went to 
public school in Germany till 1936. I did have, in pub
lic school, gentile girlfriends, very good gentile 
girlfriends. But after 1935, I did not dare being fr
iends with them because it would ha ve been too 
dangerous for their parents who were in busin
ess and probably would have had to bear the 
consequences of their children
 having a Jewish girlfriend. 
 
Anthony:
 Did you leave school in '36? 
 

Hanna:
 I left  school in '36 in order to enter Jewish 
school. All Jewish children
 whose fathers were not 
World Wa r I veterans and front-line se
rvice had to enter Jewish schools. 
 
Anthony:
 So you had to leave the public schools? 
 

Hanna:
 We  had to leave the public 
school and enter Jewish school. 
 

Anthony:
 This would be the fall of '36? 
 

3
Hanna:
 The fall of '36, yes. It so happens the school 
year actually starts in 
Europe, at that time, 
started at Easter time. But we had--the Je
wish school was opened in September of 1936. 
 
Anthony:
 This was a new Jewish school or an older one? 
 

Hanna:
 No, it was brand new. It had to
 be created. We  did not have 
in Ka rlsruhe a private Jewish 
school like there was in Frankfurt,
 the Philanthropin. We  had to go 
to this school, we had no choice. 
We had wonderful Jewish teachers. We were hous
ed in a school building, a public school building 
that was set aside for the me ntally retarded. We  sh
ared this school building 
with them. However, we 
were not allowed to share with them, the courtyard. 
They had to stay on one side and we had to stay 
on the other side of the courtyar
d during recess. Sc hool was okay, we
 were no longer exposed to the 
harassment that we had endured in public school. So
 this part was okay. We come  to Nove mber '38, 
the Kristallnacht. In the morning I went to school
 like any other day. On my way to the school, I saw 
the fire engines standing in front of a buildi
ng where the orthodox Jewi
sh community was housed. 
Now it was very strange; there was a building in 
front, you went through a c
ourtyard and then came  
the synagogue. The fire engines we
re standing there and I didn't  s
ee any fire. I didn't see anything. 
When I came to school, I said ve
ry loudly to my friends, you know th
e fire engines are standing in 
front of that synagogue. They all looked at me  
and said, don't you know what happened?  I said, no, 
what's  going on?  And here were some  of the girls 
in tears because their fathers had been arrested. 

Being that there was no ma le in our house, obviousl
y they didn't come  to arrest anybody. What they 
did while I was away in school, is th
at they smas hed all our showcases. 
I think they kept us in school 
for about two hours because again the ma le teachers we
re absent--they had been arrested. There we re 
some  fe ma le teachers and they ma de us write so
me silly composition. Around ten o'clock, they let us 
go home . When I came home  and approached the house 
we lived in, I saw my mother in the street 

with a broom sweeping up the glass 
from all of the showcases. I hadnever seen my mother sweep the 
street . Around my mother, were a lot of people sc
reaming and whistling and making fun of her. Our 
employee, which we had at that time , still in the 
business, a very decent person; his name  was Josef 
Kohl mann, he's still alive, wanted 
to sweep the street for my moth
er. She would not let him because 
she was afraid he would be killed in
 the process or  at least harmed, le
t's put it that way.
 The next thing 
I knew, I heard that the conservative synagogue also 
had been put on fire. I think Kristallnacht was on 
a Thursday because I realized 
all of a sudden that on Friday 
night, we would not be going to 
synagogue for services. It wasn't  that I was so re
ligious but I did belong to
 the choir. This was a 
children's choir and so that was the 
big thing to go there, not for serv
ices but a choir. What can I tell 
you?  It was a horrible thing. The me
n were arrested. We  heard all sorts of things that had been 
happening. My aunts' business was some how spare
d. They had no showcases, there were no me n in 
the household and there was a very 
peculiar situation in 
the house where my aunts lived. Downstairs 
was a business that dealt in wa
llpapers and things like that. 
 

Anthony:
 Which aunt was this? 
 

Hanna:
 My aunts who had the dressmaking business. 
 

Anthony:
 These were the ---? 

4
 
Hanna:
 Traubs. 
 
Anthony:
 Two aunts. 
 

Hanna:
 Three, actually. Their apartment was on the 
second fl oor and the bus
iness was on the third. 
But the son of these people who owned the house 
and the business had been a ma n who went to 
France very early in 1933. They were
 not Jewish. Every so often he 
would come  home with his car, 
with the French license plate and dr
ive this car into the entrance of th
e house. It was sort of built like 
the French houses where there's a big door to go in 
and then there's an entrance--okay. You could just 
drive the car in. He would place it 
in such a way that you could not get to the staircase. So nobody 
could go up. They see-the Nazis sa
w a car with a foreign license 
plate, they would turn around. 
 

Anthony:
 They left it alone? 
 

Hanna:
 They left it alone. So they were spared. He 
did the same  thing on the first of April, 1933. It 
never dawned on us till later on what this was re
ally all about. What th
e man actually did. Much, 
much later--only a couple of years ago I found out what it really was all about. This ma n had 
smuggled Jews and others from Ger many to France. 
He would come  at night with his car with the 
French license plate, take  the people to France wi
th his parents' passports
, German pas s ports, passed 
the border into France at night and 
take the people over. He did th
is apparently on quite a regular 
basis. So he ma de it his business to be there on the 
1st of April of 1933 so my aunts were very nicely 
protected. He  was there again on th
e tenth of November whe n the Kristallnacht happened. So at least 
they were protected. This was 1938. School became  
a some time a ffair for quite a few months. We  
would have ma ybe school three time s a week fo
r two hours. What we would have was English, 

German and arithmetic. That was about all that coul
d be taught at the time
. It lasted probably two, 
three months before all the ma le teachers were back 
and school started to fall back into place. At this 
point so ma ny of the young people had 
left that we were mo ved out of
 the building where the retarded 
children were to entirely a bu
ilding belonging to the Jewish co
mmunity next to the burned-out 
synagogue. School took place there. Makeshift, as mo
re children left, the classes became s maller. 
They were being combined so two grades were 
put together. We learned anyway somehow. and I 

think some time s better than the other public me . I ha
d an eighth grade educa
tion and since I could not 
take an apprenticeship, there was nothing for me  to 
do. She sent me  to a boarding school, not a fancy 
boarding school, near Ha nover in the north of Germany. 
This was a school that was originally built to 
teach horticulture. A Jewish institution that also 
taught housekeeping, or home ma king and all that sort 
of thing. So this was a solution for a fe w months 
and I was there, I think, from March or April, 1940 
till August of 1940 when my mother 
made me come back because she didn't  feel well. She had some 
sort of an inflammation in her arm, s he couldn't m
ove her arm. There were after all, my grandmother 
to be taken care of and she was then 91. 

 
Anthony:
 She was living w
ith your mother? 
 

Hanna:
 She was living with us. She moved into our 
house after my brother left for America. My 

5
aunts, my three aunt s, the sisters of my mother 
moved in with us because 
not having a business any 
more, you had to conserve funds. One rent was e
nough. Besides that, if you had a large apartment and 
room to spare, the Jewish fa milies had to move 
together. So this was our solution that the whole 
fa mily lived in one place. My mother ma de me  come  back in August of 1940, in a way lucky for me  
because we were deported on October 22, 1940. Had I b
een still in that school
, my way would have 
been to Theresienstadt and proba
bly later on to Auschwitz or God 
knows where. I don't  think I would 
be sitting here in Bayside today. 
We  got deported to Gurs, six wome n, 
we were arrested this morning. 
The following thing happened. My mother went out
 very early around 8 o'clock to do some  shopping. 
She came back a very short time later and said she 
me t a ma n in the street, a Jewish fellow she knew -
- who was, by the way, a very distan
t relative -- who told her that we
 would be arrested and deported 
this very day. My mother said you must be craz
y. She would not believe it. On second thought, she 
went to the Jewish community, to the offices, th
e admi nistration of the Jewish community and she 

found that it was locked. Then she realized that th
e ma n was right. She came  ho
me and she told all of 
us. The next thing she did was to tell me  to take 
various items, very beautif
ul bohemi an crystal stuff 
that she had promised to a friend who was gentile, that
 if we ever left, she w
ould give it to her as a 
present. She said to me , take these things and bri
ng it to her. The name of the lady was Erika Fite. Her 
husband was a lawyer and they were good friends of our
s. When I came there to drop off the stuff, she 
said to me , my husband said, you will be deported 
to the south of France. I came home, I told my 
mother. We  had no idea how he knew but he 
knew. Again, of course, you don't believe it. 
 

Anthony:
 So it wasn't  a believable--? 
 

Hanna:
 It wa s not a believable thing to us! Right?  
Li ke my husband told you. It wasn't  believable, 
right? So we packed the best we could. I packed fo
r my grandmother; my mother packed for herself 
and myself; my aunts packed for themselves more 
or less. Here we are six wome n, age 16 to 91 1/2. 
There were twelve men arresti
ng them! Six defe nseless women, 12 
me n, okay. Now my grandmother, 
of course, could not walk to wherever people we
re being sent. That was clear. She was totally 
confused why she was--why was she thrown out of
 her place. What was happening, where were we 
going?  She couldn't comprehend it. She was not seni
le, incidentally. She just could not understand 
what was happening. After all, her husband had been 
in the war, her children 
were in the war, why 
was this happening to her?  Why was this happening to
 all of us?  So we had to sign before we left the 
apartment, we had to sign papers 
turning all belongings ove
r to the German Reich. We had to evaluate 
how much the apartment was worth. My mother di
d and she signed. My aunt
, Helena Goldstein, she 
did not want to sign. She just did not want to si
gn. So the Gestapo ma n told her very simply, look, 
unless you si gn, we will send you away from Platfor m 
Six on the railway st ation. Platform Six meant 
the trains going to Munich and Dachau. So she signe
d very quickly. Also we realized that what we 
had been told, south of France, could ma ybe be co
rrect. We  a r e not going to Dachau, that was sure. 
 
Anthony:
 And it mi ght not be as bad as Dachau. Dachau, you heard about--? 
 

Hanna:
 Exactly, exactly. 
 

Anthony:
 South of France, you didn't know of any camps there? 

6
 
Hanna:
 We  didn't know of any camps. We  knew nothing 
at all. Not anything. Since my grandmother 
couldn't walk, they brought around 
a police car, but an open--like an
 open truck where they would 
move ma ybe 30, 40 policemen at a time
 for riot control, or whatever. 
It wa s an open car with benches. 
Now you try to get a 91-year-old woma n up on t hat 
truck. There are no steps going up. There are only 
little foot things on the side that 
flip down. I tried desperately to ge
t my grandmother up, tried to push 
her up. She had nothing to hold on to. There were peopl
e standing, watching this 
scene of me  trying to 
get this old woman up on this thi
ng. Finally one of the me n who had ar
rested us, put her up there. So 
then it was running back and helping the others bri
ng down the suitcases and all 
of that. And that's  the 
way we were transported to the ra
ilway station. What they used at 
the railway station was an unused 
entrance. This was originally the entrance only bei
ng used for the royalty. They had a special entrance 
at the railroad station. This is wh
ere we were assembled. It didn't take
 my  mother very long to see that 
certain things were being filmed. Bec a use of that
, there was a man standing 
there. He was a dentist 
and the tears were rolling down his cheeks. He was to
tally out of it. My mo ther
 went over to him and 
said, you know, we 'r e being filmed. If you don't  st
op crying, I'm going to crack you one. She meant it 
because she was embarrassed that he would do that 
and show the Germans, you know, that he was so 
upset. He stopped. We  were loaded 
in the train, probably some ti me  in
 the afternoon. I don't think that 
in the railroad car where I was--w
as my fa mily there was any light. 
We  were in the dark during the 
night. I don't know if the other cars had light but ours
 certainly didn't. The first stop that I reme mbe r  
ma king was in Mauthausen, and we 
were given some thing to eat. Al
so our money, the 100 ma rks that 
we were allowed to take along other than the l
uggage we could carry, was changed to 2,000 French 
francs. We  were on that train till the 25th of October and we arrived in Ol oron Sainte-Marie. On our 
train was the only person that escaped from any of 
the nine trains that ma de their way down to the 
south of France. At one time , the train had to stop 
and I believe it was to take on water for the engine. 
It was already in the French unoccupied zone
 and the Germans were gone. We ma naged, some  
ma naged--people went out of the train to get water 
to drink. I wanted to get out of the train to get 
water. My mother wouldn't let me because she was 
afraid the train would move away and I wouldn't 
ma ke it back. I looked out the window and there I 
saw this wo ma n running away, up the embankme nt 
on the side of the railroad station, was a very little
 railroad station. Some one, in fact it was a ma n by 
the name  of Hugo Stein, a lawyer, threw the luggage out the wi ndow. This woma n really and truly 
ma de it. She had relatives in the area; she knew ex
actly where she was. She ma de it, she was never 
arrested. She ma de her way to Ame r ica where sh
e had children. Unfortuna
tely, her son must be 
mentally ill because he killed his mother about, I 
would say, twenty-five years ago. He murdered he r. 
The poor woma n was, by the way, a widow so it was ha
rd. When we arrived in Oloron Sainte-Marie, 
it rained like you cannot believe. It
 wa s just like if you are standi
ng under a huge shower. We  were 
off-loaded but I would like to interject here, 
that on the train, my grandmother became totally 
confused. She did not know where she was, what it 
was. She was totally confused. There was another 
ma n with us in the same  car. He also, very old, 
he also became confused. It was some how possible 
and I don't reme mber how, to call the one doctor th
at was on the train, the one doctor who was still 
permitted to practice. He came and he took a look at 
the situation and he gave
 me a sma ll handful of 
sleeping pills to give to
 my grandmother. I got them down in
to her. Unfortunately, she survived. 
 

Anthony:
 Survived? 

7
 
Hanna:
 She survived the handf
ul of sleeping pills. 
 
Anthony:
 So what was your intent in giving her these pills? 
 

Hanna:
 The intent of the doctor was to put her out. To 
really finish it right there and then. It didn't 
work. Maybe it wasn't  enough, ma ybe she was just t
oo strong. I don't know. But it was a hard thing to 
do, to put this ma ny sleeping pills in
to some one, knowing what it will do. 
 

Anthony:
 Whose idea was it, the doctor's? 
 

Hanna:
 The doctor's, entirely the doctor™s. He was ri
ght. I don't --the ma n was right. When we arrived 
at Oloron Sainte-Marie, she and the other old--the 
other ma n--the old ma n, a Mr. Wital, were removed 
fr om the train, separately. My mother at the time sa
id that she would want to go with her mother-in-
law and she was not allowed to go. We never knew wh
ere she was taken. We  were about ten days to 
two weeks in the camp before we found out that 
she had been brought back to the camp. She was  
perfectly normal. She recognized us, she knew 
her surroundings. She couldn't understand them but 
she knew. I mean, who can understand at that age, 
right? She was in a different block. She was not in 
our block, she was in a different block. Except they 
had a barracks over there 
that was set up for old 
people and they had some sort of beds for them. Sh
e was better off there than being with us on the 
floor. We  had to leave her over ther
e and my mother went to see her 
as much as possible. She lived 
till January 7, 1941. At that time , she just gave out. 
 

Anthony:
 Passed away? 
 

Hanna:
 She passed away. I supposed that she must have gotten pneumonia or whatever from lying 
there, you know. You have old peop
le lying down a lot, this is 
the usual story. Not enough food and 
she was--she had a very healthy appetite, my gran
dmother. She could outdo a teenager very easily. 
She could. 
 
Anthony:
 The time she died, was she sharing he
r barracks with anybody in the family? 
 

Hanna:
 No, no. But my mother went over there as much
 as possible. There were people taking care 
of these old people. That was the 
good part about it, that
 there were people help
ing the elderly there. 
 
Anthony:
 From the ca mp, or--? 
 

Hanna:
 People that were, no--people from the camp. All of
 these things were left  to the people in the 
camp, the inmates. The inmates basically ran th
e camp. Ever y block had its own administration. 
Surely the admi nistration of the block was respon
sible to headquarters, if
 you wish, but on a daily 
basis, it was the people in the camp, the interned 
people that were running it. My grandmother passed 
away in January, my mo ther's  oldest sister died in February. She was, in any case, a very sick person, 
I had no idea, at the time we were deported. Again 
it was hunger, cold, wet,
 what-have-you that she 

8
just coul d not survive. She was also nearly blind fr
om diabetes. Life in the camp--the biggest problem 
was mud because it rained all the time. You we re a
nkle deep of earth in the mud. It was a big problem 
especially with the old people. They could not ex
tricate themselves many times when they fell. It 
rained constantly during the winter
, or almost all the time. Wa ter was three times a day for two hours 
each. In the beginning we  had to wash ourselves
 outdoors. The me n always had to--the wome n 
eventually had a barracks where there was just, youknow, a possibility to get washed and what have 
you. But the me n forever had to wash themselves
 outdoors, no ma tter what the weather was or 
whatever. By the way, in plain sight of the ma in 
road of the camp, so that when people walked by, 
they could see everybody standing there. It wa
s before nude beach. It 
was very, very tough. I 
eventually worked in the office of the block and 
this is how I got to know my future husband who 
came to see his mother who worked in the office. She worked there ma inly because she spoke fluent 
French and people who could speak French were needed
 in or der to deal with 
the admi nistration. So I 
worked in this office and this is how I me t my hu
sband. Should we go and tell 
the rest of the story?  
So, one day we got supplementary food from the Sw
iss Red Cross. They had established a barracks 
there and the Red Cross was in charge of it and 
food was given to the young 
people, the children, the 
young people and to the adults that we re ailing or  
so down, so ma lnourished that they really could 
barely walk. We  had to go every morning and have 
our food right there. We 
could not take anything 
out of there to prevent black ma rket
, giving it to the fa mily, what have
 you. It was a great help, a great 
help that we got this extra food. Eventually a 
social worker came  around and asked my  mother 

whether she would let me  go to a village in Fr
ance, Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon where there were people 
who wanted to help young people to survive, to get 
out of the camps. My mother asked me  and I said 
yes. Then we didn't hear for ma ny weeks. I would 
like to me ntion that ther
e was a tremendous cultural 
life in Gurs. There was chamber music, there was 
an orchestra. There were cabaret performa nces, 
lectures. Eventually a school fo
r the young children was established 
and the adults somehow for me d 
some classes for English still hoping that people w
ill ma ke it to an English-speaking country, name ly 
America. There were French lessons for the childr en 
and I di d not participate in spite of the fact that  
my then boyfriend told me  that I ha
ve to learn Fr ench. Never listened. 
 

Anthony:
 Was your mother actively i
nvolved in these activities? 
 

Hanna:
 My mother was involved in the English less
ons, yes. She did not do 
anything musically, no. 
 

Anthony:
 Your aunts? 
 

Hanna:
 My aunts, the two rema ining 
aunts after--no, no. They were also busy ma king ma ybe out of 
some  old some thing, ma ybe a blouse or a skirt or so
me thing. Because this was really their background 
so if they got hold of anything that co
uld be sewn together, they would do it. 
 

Anthony:
 How much time elapsed before your 
mother found out about your boyfriend? 
 

Hanna:
 Oh, no time at all. She knew. There was no problem there. 
 

Anthony:
 She was happy?

Hanna:
 She didn't object, she didn't say anything. 
 
Anthony:
 She thought he was nice young ma n? 
 

Hanna:
 She probably thought it was a perf
ectly norma l thing. After all I 
was sixteen years old and he 
was nineteen. No, there was never any problem th
ere. There was once a problem when a lady was 
me ntioning to some one e l se in the latrine that, and my 
mother was in one of the stalls of this latrine at 
this particular mo me nt when the woma n said, it's a 
terrible thing. This Hannah is pregnant from t his 
fellow she's going with. Of course, it wasn't  true. My 
mother heard it and my mother told me about it. 
This lady wa s busy with social work and God-knows-
what and she liked to ask me  to do things for 

her, to run an errand or to take care of this or that
 in the offi ce. After I heard, my mother told me that  
when she approached me  I said, well I guess from today on you're going to do it yourself. I'm not 

going to run for you anymore. This story had a 'ver y funny ending in that this woma n a l so went to 
Cuba, just like my two s urviving aunts. After our 
daughter was born in 1946, I wrote to my aunts that 
the baby this particular lady ha
d talked into my belly back 
in 1941 has now been born. A long 
pregnancy from '41 to '4 6, better than an elephant
. If I have a daughter an
d she had a daughter who 
was far away and I don't know what my daughter wa
s doing, then I would be very careful to talk 
about other people's children. It happened that the le
tter arrived at my aunt's
. My aunt was not feeling 
well and she was in bed and the lady came to vi
sit. My aunt, innocently
 said, oh Mrs. would you 
please read that letter to me . Of 
cour se, she had to read what I had written to my aunts, which was 
certainly a gr eat embarrassment to her. But in a wa
y, I got my revenge for being nasty. But it brings 
us back to Gurs. One day, indeed, the social work
er came around and said we were ready to leave. I 
left, beginning of September, 1941 to go to Le
 Chambon. Le Cha mbon was a ma rvelous experience. 

The people there were terrific. We  could feel at 
home . Even so, I first had to learn French. The 
population to me  is the best on Earth and you know 
there's a documentary about this village. I was 
there a year and a half. Now in th
e summer of 1942, my mot her had b
een very ill around June, July, I 
think. May or June. I had for weeks, no letters from 
my mother. Finally, my cousin wrote me  and said 
she had been very ill. She was operated in the hosp
ital. This hospital, by the way, in the camp was 
only for desperately ill people and not the people 
who were suffering from dysentery and dying from 
dysentery in the blocks in the beginning when we
 were in Gurs. In Gurs, we would have in the 
beginning as ma ny as 20 to 25 deaths a day, a day!
 Because dysentery was just rampant, other 
diseases were rampant. So she was operated in 
the camp hospital. We ll, we found out--they found out 

in camp that she actually had diabetes. People who have diabetes are very prone to come  up with all 
sorts of pus-filled what you would call boils, carb
uncles, what have you. This is exactly what 
happened to her and she had a very huge one on he
r back. Later on some one who assisted at that 
surgery told me  that the cut was about 15 centime
ters long which would ma
ke it about six inches, 
right. It was decided that because she had been so ill 
that I coul d come to the camp and visit with her. 
All the arrangements were ma de. I had pass, a so
uth country pass so I could travel without being 
arrested or what have you. I went
 down to Gurs. On the way I passed my boyfriend who was then just 
freshly liberated from the camp to a Jewish Boy Sc
out farm a nd I went down to the camp. When I 
came to the camp, the first thing I found out that th
e camp wa s closed to all visitors. The thing was 
that my husband, then boyfriend told me , if you 
come  to Oloron, find out about the ambulance that 

10
Gurs to Po because there was the ambulance from the camp would occasionally go up once or twice a 
week, go to Po, to the big hospita
l there. Maybe on their way back, 
you can hitch a ride up to camp. 
Well, when I inquired about camp ambulance in Oloron th
ey told me  it had not come  for days and that 
the camp wa s closed. So I had very bad vibes righ
t there and then but I went. Sure enough, when I 
came to the camp, they would not let me  in. It was 
closed. .So I had to find lodgings in a neighboring 
little village, village of Chaooz(phonetic) (c.451). I then got in t
ouch with people in the camp. I think 
the next morning, also, it was arranged that I c
ould see my mo ther, oh about 300 feet away, through 
various rows of barbed wire. I wa
s standing on the road and it didn't 
take long before the police came  
along and tried to chase me  a way. I 
saw my mother about two times that
 way. Then I was told that she 
would be deported; that the trains would be leavi
ng. Again the organizations, the Swiss Red Cross, the 
Quakers, whoever was then working in the camp, saw 
to it that I was given permission to come to the 
railroad station, which was again th
e freight yard. It's  always the 
freight yard. I went to Oloron. I 
stayed during the night in the street because I di
dn't dare go anywhere close to the railroad station. 
Found a house or two houses, there wa
s a little wall, ma ybe two feet hi
gh between these two houses. I 
sort ma de camp on this little wall--had a blanke
t with me and a little 
pillow. Sure enough the 
gendarmes came around, the police came  around during 
the night. Here's  a young girl and they are 
two policemen. After they looked at my papers, th
eir intentions were not 
too honorable. They said 
some thing, oh if she's pretty enough. I became very ugly, very suddenly and they walked away. 

Around five o'clock in the morning, I went over to 
the freight yard. At th
at point, everybody already 
had been loaded into the trains. 
I, not knowing in which car my moth
er was, I sort of leaned back 
against the loading dock of the freight yards and 
there was a French policem
an standing there. He 
asked me  what I was doing there and I told him.  Th
en he told me what's going on here, tears my heart 
out, and then turned around and said to me , woul
d you like to have a drink?
 Because he had a hip 
flask, you ever seen a French ---?  So I declined that
 and he was helpful in fi
nding the car in which my 
mother was. This is where I saw my mother for the 
last time. People were in a terrible condition--they 
were. You cannot even de scribe  how these people--mos
t of them were. Some s
till did not realize what 
this was all about. One woman in th
e car where my mother was, got il
l so they wanted to call for the 
nurse that was along. I told them I think you will ha
ve to forget about the nurses now. My mother 
realized that she would never come  back. In the car--- 

 
Anthony: 
Where were they told that  they were going? 
 

Hanna:
 They were not told anything. They were not
 told anything to my 
knowledge. I think they 
guessed very much wha t  the destination, you know, th
at would be the end, end of the road. My 
mother left me  no doubt . She says, I will not come back. 
 
Anthony: 
What kind of a train was it? 
 

Hanna:
 A cattle train. 
 

Anthony: 
A cattle train. 
 

Hanna:
 Yeah, a cattle train. In the catt
le train, they had straw on the floor and there was some  food in 

11
the car, which the Quakers had supplied. This is l
ooking back at the scene the best I can reme mbe r . I 
do not know if there was luggage in that car or not. 
It could be that they th
rew some  luggage in there 
but I'm not sure but there was some  food in there. 
 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber the date? 
 

Hanna:
 The date was August 6, 1942. The last thing I saw of my--I went to the next  car for two 
mi nutes to say goodbye to my cousin. My cousin, Lily Franken nee Traub. She was in the next car 

and I wanted to say goodbye to her. 
 
Anthony: 
Lily was in the same  convoy? 
 

Hanna:
 The same  convoy, so was her husband. A French
 policeman came over to me  and grabbed me  
and said I had no business going to this car. What
 was I doing here?  I was a civilian person and I 
explained it to him. I said I didn't do anything 
but say goodbye to my cousin. He dragged me  of 
course to his superior. He was rea
dy to grab me and dump me  in. I ex
plained it to the superior what I 
had done and I said I didn't  do anything wrong. I just 
said goodbye to my cousi
n, that's  all. He told 
this guy, forget it, leave her alone. So I was fortunat
e that they were not--that 
the superior, captain or 
whatever he was, was not that mean that 
he was going to throw me into the trai n. 
 
Anthony: 
Were you ever able to talk to your cousin? 
 

Hanna:
 Maybe for a mi nute, ma ybe for a mi nute. 
 
Anthony: 
Was she as pessimi stic as your mother was? 
 

Hanna:
 I don't think we ever came to that point. 
You know, it was just a kiss, a hug, whatever. The 
last thing I saw of my mother af
ter the trains was locked, was a wh
ite handkerchief fluttering out of 
those slits they have in the cattle cars, you know. Ca
ttle cars in Europe are di
fferent. You have seen 
the one they have in th
e museum in Washington. So you see they
 are different from the cattle cars 
here in America, they are more open. Over there, they
 are mo re closed and just
 have little air slits on 
the top and that was the last I saw of my mother
. It was abominable. The scene was abominable. I 
went back to the place where I had taken lodgings.
 It was a simple farm house, was renting out a 
couple of rooms. The next day I went back to Le
 Cha mbon. That is to say 
on my way to Le Cha mbon, 
I again stopped where my boyfriend was. I told him 
at the time  what had happened. He told me  that 
they found out that they will be roundups in France. 
I told him at the time, if it's not sa fe where you 

are here, then come  where I am. 
Sure enough, within two weeks. . . 
 

Anthony: 
He took you up on your offer? 
 

Hanna:
 Took me  up on what I said. He came wit h a fr
iend, now a friend, not then. You didn't really 
know hi m at that time, Walter Jaco
bavich who now lives out in Palo
 Alto, Jacobovsky?  Now lives out 
in Palo Alto, calls hims elf Wa ter Chang, ma kes 
it much simpl e r. The two of them ca me. What 

12
happened there is really is in Le Chambon--the
 seven of us who originally came from Gurs
 
we were 
seven young people who left Gurs together, had decide
d, said we cannot, with the danger that it was, 
stay in the house where we lived. Said we want
ed to go into the other house that the Swiss 
organization, the Swiss Red Cross 
was running there. So at night, we
 went to the other house thinking 
that they will not come  where the little ones are. 
Because we were the bi g ones, we were teenagers 
and in the other house they had the little children. 
They will look for us where we are supposed to be 
and not over there. We ll, we slept there a couple
 of nights. One morning, on our way back, and it 
wasn't  far, it was just up and down the hill, it was a fi ve-minute walk at  best, I hear  some whistling 
behind me . I was with my girlfriend... 
 
Tape 1, Side B 
 
She turned around and she said turn around. I said 
no, I'm goi ng to turn around. It's the boys from the 
school here, I'm not going to 
turn around, leave me  alone. 
 
Anthony: 
She knew who he was? 
 

Hanna:
 She had turned around for a whistle, you bet!
 Eventually, she took 
me  by my shoulder and 
turned me  around and here was my boyfriend who ha
d arrived during the night 
and had ma de camp at 
a tennis court of a fa mily by the name Erinches, ri
ght?  Many years later we me t the Erinches, that is 
to say we met their son and daughte
r-in-law and fa mily. We  told him 
the story and he was so amused 
that he took us over to the now to
tally different tennis court, totally
 overgrown and to
ok a picture of 
us because he thought it was so amus ing. Well, Ma
x was hidden in the ve ry same  night, Madame  
Ontre Philip, Mary Philip who died last Novemb er
, a great lady, terrific pe
rson who worked in the 
underground, French resistance. Her husband was 
right-hand to Gen. DeGaulle, a woma n who wa s 
shot at Lyon and pretended to be dead and rema ined
 lying in the street  till
 everything was okay for her 
to get up. The Germans thought she was dead. She 
was a wonderful human being. I took him to her 
and she immediately saw to it that 
he was hidden the very same  night. 
He was with a fa mily in some  
private home. The next day he was placed with far m
ers who took very good care of him. He lived in 
the hayloft. He lived in the hayloft for, I guess, cl
ose to four weeks. What the farmer had done--he cut 
out a square in the hayloft, which was absolutely 
above the stables where the animals were. So that 
was his toilet. He came down only once a day for th
e evening meal. That wa
s it. He had nothing to 
read or do but the gospel, the New Testament. So 
it was an introduction to some thing he didn't want 
to know, I suppose. He stayed there 
for four weeks. They brought him back and the very next day he 
was sent off to Switzerland. This was before we, that
 is my friends and I, the seven of us, or ma ybe 
we were even more at that poin
t; who slept in the othe
r house ma de the acquaintance of the Gestapo 
during the night. Because indeed they came. Of cour
se they knew exactly who we were. They had our 
name s, they had everything. The ma n who was in char
ge of the Swiss operation 
in this village, Mr. 
Bonee explained to the Gestapo, said, they could 
not touch us. That we we
re under Swiss protection. 
No way. But  he talked long enough and hard enough to 
ma ke  this person, this Gestapo official sort of 
start to doubt. He said, okay, I leave them here in
 your charge. I will ask my superiors in the morning 
whether this true. If it is not true, I will be back and we will arrest  them. You personally ar e 
responsible for them. They have to stay here in
 the house. So they left. By the way, one of my 

13
girlfriends tried to jump out -- di
d jump out of the house sma c k into
 the arms  of the police who had 
surrounded the house. She wanted to run away, no dice. 
 
Anthony: 
She was nailed? 
 

Hanna:
 She was nailed, well; she came  back into the hous
e. They didn't take her. As morning broke, 
we went into the woods and disappeared. We  just 
disappeared. We  were all 
day long in the woods and 
evening time people came around and picked us up and 
brought us to various farms. We were totally 
separated from one another. There 
wa s one girl with me , which I ha
d never seen before, did not know 
her. We  wer e  first on one farm. The n we were move
d after two weeks to another farm. Both farms, by 
the way, were searched by the police. They came around and in the first one, we couldn't quite hear 

what was going on but the farmers there had built a 
hideaway for us. It was all woodpiles. Wood piled 
up from floor to ceiling built in a U shape. You 
could pullout  one bundle of wood and slip in and 
replace this bundle of wood so you're
 totally hidden away. They were in the downstairs and they 
talked to the farmers and after some time, they left
. The farme r , of course, came and said we can come  
out. Then we were move d to another far m and th
ere again they came . We  were hidden in a free-
standing closet, an armo ire behind th
e clothes. In front was a row of
 shoes so our shoes looked like 
the shoes that were standing ther
e. The clothes was hanging very 
far down so you couldn't see the 
legs. We  heard police downstairs asking the farm
er, are you hiding any Jews?  The farmer calml y 
replying, I don't know what Jews look like, and offe
red them a glass of wine
. They declined, thanks 
God, because we were dying in that closet of
 fear. They left so twice they mi ssed us. 
 
Anthony: 
Did they return the next morning to the pe
rson who was held responsible for your group? 
 
Hanna:
 I don't know. I never even aske
d him. I know hi m very well but
 I never really asked him. 
Next time I see him, ma ybe when I write hi m, I will ask hi m. 

 
Anthony: 
But he wasn't  taken away? 
 

Hanna:
 No, no, absolutely not. In February of 1943, 
I ma de my way into Switzerland. I had my 
mother's sister in Switzerland. She was ma rried ther
e. They were very we ll to do people, more than 
well-to-do people. I ma de it known to my fa mily in 
Switzerland that I would lik
e to leave. They did 
indeed arrange for me  to get an 
entry visa into Switzerland. Now in 
order to get the entry visa into 
Switzerland, you have to have an exit visa. Of cour
se you could not get an exit vi sa, that was futile. 
So they arranged for a guide but that ma n said I had to ma ke my way from Le Cha mbon to 

Anne ma sse outside of Annema sse on my own, whic
h I did. All alone, I had no one to go with me. I 
did the whole thing. I had false papers. 

 
Anthony: 
Traveled by day? 
 

Hanna:
 Traveled by day, traveled by night. 
 

Anthony: 
This is when this part of France had been occupied? 

14
 
Hanna:
 In Fe bruary of 1943 when all of France was 
occupied. When I came to Lyon railroad station 
as well as in (?  c.701), there wa
s a lot of Ger man army people th
ere, standing around. In Lyon, I had 
to wait a long, long time for a train 
going in this direction. I was sitt
ing in the waiting room with a 
French ma gazine, right? Pretendi ng to
 be reading it. I had taken with
 me  a briefcase, a very narrow 
one, a very narrow one with a zipper. 
I had a little bit of food in ther
e, some  bread and a little bit of 
cheese, a towel, maybe a t
oothbrush. I'm not quite sure I still had 
a toothbrush at that point. I think a 
nightgown; I don't know why I took a nightgown. I wo
re everything double. I wore two skirts, two 
sweaters, two blouses, you know. 
 
Anthony: 
It was cold then? 
 

Hanna:
 Everything double because it's all I could take. It 
wasn't  that it was so 
cold -- and a coat --  
because unless I wore it, I could not take it. So
 I took nothing, nothing wi
th me . I just had enough 
money to get from Cha mbon to Annema sse and left 
a few francs at the convent in Annema sse. This 
was supposed to be my c ontact point, the convent in 
Annema s se. Since I arrived 
at night, the gate was 
locked, the bell was disconnected. On 
the trai n, in the compartment, I was fi nally able to sit down. We 
were three people, two wome n and a ma n. I pretended to
 fall asleep. I figured if there they come  for 
papers, I have a long time in waking up and -- y
ou know. I heard them talk
 about the underground, 
which was very foolish of them. When we got off 
the train in Annemasse b
ecause it was the last stop 
then for this particular train, he said to me , 
where are you going?  I said, I'm going to the convent. 
They'r e waiting for me . He said, you know how to get ther
e?  I said, no, but I will find it. It can't  be so 

difficult. He said, I will take you th
ere. I said, that's not necessary. 
I will take you there. So he took 
me , and of course the gate was locked, the bell 
was disconnected. Now what?  I said, well then I'll 
have to go a hotel. So he was nice enough to go to one
 of the other hotels, and they were all fully 
occupied. He  finally was able to 
find a hotel for me if you ca n call it 
a hotel. It was a bit unbelievable. 
To me  at least, it was. I had never seen anything 
like that. I registered with my phony name , a totally 
phony address, a place I had never be
en in my life. I ma de it all up. The whole thing was ma de up. I f 
they had asked me  where is Rue Garibaldi in 
Lyon, I wouldn't have known where it was. But every 
city in France has a Rue Garibald
i for sure. Okay. I register ed, I went to my room. I locked the door 
very carefully and I went to sleep. The next morning I left. I had no breakfa st or anything. I went to 

the convent. In the convent, they told me  what I 
have to do, where I have to go and how to go there. 
They gave me  a breakfast, bread and 
coffee, whatever they had. I left 
them just about the last of my 
money because I felt it was very nice of them, y
ou know. To give me  anything, right?  I ma de my  way 
to Annema sse, partly by bus, partly on foot. On
 the way, I passed a cust oms place. Little customs 
house. I figured, hmm, it 's wartime. There's 
no commerce going on between here and Switzerland, 
impossible, what for?  Ah, walked by. Next thing I know, he called me  back. 

 
Anthony: 
Did you have anything to declare? 
 

Hanna:
 Wh ere you going?  To Annema sse. Your  papers. So
 I give him my papers
. Then he looks at 
me  and says  are you Jewi sh. I still don't know where 
the answer came from and 
I said I've nothing to 
do with that dirty race. He  closed my papers and 
smiled and said you can go. That was that. That was 

15
the only time in my life I denied being Jewish. 
I don't know where the answer came from, but I guess 
it was the right answer. I walked to
 Anne ma sse and I think in fact 
the little place was called Duvin. I 
was supposed to go to the priest which I did. The pr
iest sent a little boy with me  to the guide. The 
guide had been paid by my fa mily in Switzerland. 
There was a woma n who already in the First World 
War did things like that. She was ha
rd at work again. I came to the guide and there was a family there 
with twin boys and the guide was supposed to take 
us all across the border at night. It was the only 
time I played bridge, I know nothing about the ga
me , I was the dummy. Then they came  and brought 
a young ma n which they picked up in the church. The 
six of us were taken ac
ross the border at night. 
The guide was a big, heavy-set farmer. He wa
s a widower and he had I don't know how ma ny 
children. I guess he did much of it for the money. He 
literally carri ed us across 
this little river so we 
wouldn't be wet. He explained to us how we have to walk. He gave the father of this family Swiss 
money so we could go onto the streetcar that
 was going back and forth between Geneva and 
Anne ma sse. He told us how to walk in order to co
me  out at the right place to catch the streetcar. 
There was only one thing. The first time  around, we wa
lked in a circle because it was dark and we 
came out exactly where he had started, under the 
same  tree. The second time around, we knew better 
and we found our way. We boarded the streetcar, he pa
id for all six of us. That was fine and we were 
told where to get off and at that 
place was another contact person, some
one  of his fa mily. She, in turn, 
distributed us into hotels that we
re willing to take people like that
 in the mi ddle of the night, which 
was probably illegal. The next morning, she came 
and collected us. I told her, it was around 11 
o'clock at night, to please call my aunt imme diately. 
She said it™s 11 o'clock, I said do me  a favor and 
call her right away. She did, and my a unt came the ne
xt morning and picked my up in Geneva. I lived 
with my relatives in Berne for--from March, actua
lly it was the first of March when I got into 
Switzerland, till the 23rd of Dece mbe r , the 23rd or
 the 24th of December, 1944 at which time, I ran 
away, to put it plain. I left because
 I could no longer tolerate the situation. They had absolutely no 
understanding for what I had experienced. They 
opposed my  future husba nd because how could I 
ma ke such a decision without asking anybody?  We  ha
ve nothing, we have no profession, we have no 
savings, we are nothings. There was 
also the thing, that whenever 
some thing went on, what would 
your mother say?  We ll, I knew very well what ha
d happened, okay. At that time in Switzerland the 

newspapers started to be full of that stuff, oka
y. We knew at this point 
exactly what was going on. 
Still, what would your mother say? One day, I had 
it enough with that, 'w hat would your mother say'. 
I said, leave her alone. She's dead. At which point  
my aunt who couldn't face the trut h almost fainted. 
It was a ma jor fight. I think I came as close to a ne
rvous breakdown as I have ever been in my aunt's  
and my uncl e 's  house. My cousin, my mi ddle cousin, wa
s no help. He resented me . I did not realize at 
the time  nor did anyone else that he
 wa s basically a sick person. I left
 and I went to Geneva where my 
future husband was taking a course in
 social services to prepare for whatever, to have  so me thing after 
the war, to do. I went to Geneva 
and took a job as a ma id, whi c h was one
 of the few jobs that refugees 
were allowed to do. I was paid sixty francs a mo
nth, a Swiss ma id got 160 francs a month. We  di dn't 
earn the same money for the same  work. I was lucky 
to be working for a Bulgarian family where the 
son had been a diplomat. He had, however, resign
ed his diplomatic position because he was opposed 
to the politics. So they were re fugees in Switzer
land as well, but refugees with money, and with a 
permit to reside in Geneva. They had a very big ap
artment, furnished beautiful. I was the maid there, 
and they were very nice to me . I wor ked for them 
till we got ma rried in Apr
il of 1945. At that time, 
when we got ma rried, I entered the internme nt
 home to be with my husband which the Swiss 

16
governme nt gave me  permission to do. Now sometime 
later, as my husba nd explained to you before, 
the Swiss had a policy that all immi
grants who were living in refug
ee homes had to get out. They no 
longer wanted to support them. It also meant that I ha
d to get out and I had to take a room in the town 
of Mortrick (phonetic) (c.818). I ha
ve not slept one night in this 
room. We had a newborn child, not 
quite as newborn any mo re. She was ma ybe five, six 
months old at the time 
when that happened who 
remained in the refugee home. But 
mother should live outside. Now this
 was an intolerable situation. I 
was in the home  all day to take care of the baby, 
right? And at night, I should have slept some whe r e 
else! I also could not have my meals in the home a
nymore. So then finally came a decision that yes, 
because of the infant, I ca n stay in the home and I w
ill have to pay room and board at the same rate as 
the Swiss who were in the home. I could return o
fficially to the home. The Swiss had done another 

nice thing. Si nce I was an immi gran
t in Switzerland and my husband was a refugee, they had a big 
problem. Well I came in with a visa, that made me an
 immi grant. I came  in legally as a far as -- I 
crossed the border illegally, if you 
wish. But once I was in Switzerland, I was legal. When he and the 
others crossed illegally, they rema ined illegal, th
ey were refugees. So they had a big problem, the 
Swiss. Wa s this baby now going to be a refugee like
 the father  or an immi grant like the mother? It  
took several months to resolve 
this problem. They came down in 
favor of refugee, which was 
wonderful because ot herwise we would have had to 
pay for her room and board as well. What are you 
going to pay with?  The reason -- the way we could 
pay for my room and board was a very sad one. 
Because my brother who had come  he re in 1936 as 
a sixteen-year-old and by himself, had joined the 
American army voluntarily. 
 
Anthony: 
How had he come  here in '36.?  
 
Hanna:
 He came here -- my father had a half-brother here who was willing to take him, who gave me 
an affidavit to come . He stayed with this uncle an
d aunt for maybe six or ei
ght weeks, not very long. 
Then he struck out on his own. Because again it wa
s a situation of a young fellow, a 16-year-old who 
all of a sudden found hims elf in strange surroundi
ngs with people he didn't  know, wi th different 
habits and what have you. Because this aunt was not
 a very nice person, she went into my brother's 
correspondence, which he had locked away in one 
of those lock-away briefcases. She found there a 
letter from my mother asking him, because, my G
od, he was six-foot some thing and 16 years old and 
could eat a loaf of bread in one si
tting; if he had enough 
to eat, a very normal concern for a mother, 
right? She found this letter and it provoked a stor
m and so he left and struck out on his own. 
Some time later he was down at a university in Ge or
gia, became  a radio technician, then came back 
and took a job with the pilot radi
o company in New York and eventu
ally, joined the army voluntarily. 
He was killed in the Battle of the Bulge, in January 1945. Incidentally, only a few days after his death 
and I did not know that he  was dead till Ma y of '4 5 because my aunt in Switzerland di d not tell me . 
She kept this information from me until after we we
re ma rried. That he ha d been killed in action. I got 
a letter some time in the end of January. He asking 
if some how I could come  over to France and visit. 

We could meet if he has a fe
w days furlough or some thing. 
 
Anthony: 
So you were in contact with him?  
 

Hanna:
 I was in contact with him. Of course, this
 was not feasible. The gentleman for whom I 

17
worked then in Geneva tried everything if this wa
s possible for me . Because he had a lot of contacts. 
The thing wa s, no, I could not, so I never saw him again. My aunt in Switzerland, who had the 
information that he ha d been killed, 
withheld the information from me till.... 
 

Anthony: 
Until the war ended? 
 

Hanna:
 No, no, no. Till the end of April for sure, shortly
 after we were ma rried. Then she did not tell 
me  directly. She called and told my husband to tell
 me . She did not have the courage to tell me . She 
came when we were ma rried. I invited her to keep th
e peace in the family, right? So I could not hear 
from each side, what did you do?  She was at that
 marriage ceremony and didn't say a word. I didn't 
know till Ma y that he  was dead or e
nd of April that he was dead. When we heard the war was over, it 
meant nothing to me. It really didn't mean much 
any more. I wouldn't say nothing but it didn't mean 
much. Right?  We  had lost everybody, we knew they 
weren't comi ng back. My brother was dead, the 
mountains looked the same . Switzer
land was a peaceful country, and here we were. It was a very 
strange feeling to hear the King of 
England on the radio saying the war 
is over in the little English that 
I understood. He stuttered a lot so there was lot's 
of time to think about what he said. I sat down, 
listened to it and it took me  maybe 
ten mi nutes before I went down to
 the office to tell him that the 
war was over. Then, we stayed in Switzerland till '
48, before we came here. We  had a hell of a time 
getting affidavit to come  here. We  tried to stay 
in Switzerland with his cousin who was in business 
and wanted him to stay. The Swiss wouldn't permit us 
to stay. So we ca me  here in '48 and slowly had 
to start building a new life. Unfortunately we becam
e ill in 1950 with TB and first had to spend close 
to two years getting well again. Our daughter was in a foster home . She was in a very good and loving 

foster home. Nevertheless, it left its traces for 
some time. We had to start building a life like 
everybody else. It's  as simple as that. 
 
Anthony: 
Now you left two aunts behind in Gurs? 
 

Hanna:
 My two aunts in Gurs were able to leave in
 October of 1941 to go to Marseille because they 
could go to Cuba. They were first interned in Mars
eille in the Hotel Bumbaire. That  was an old worn-
out place where refugees were interned. They 
could go about, though, during the day taking care of 
the immi gration business. They ma de their way in
to Cuba. They were in Cuba actually till 1948. In 
other words, from 1942 -- they left Gurs in October, '
41; they left, I think, in 
January of '42 or before, 
first to go to Morocco and from Morocco to Cuba. Th
ey came after us. It must
 have been April when 
they came up from Cuba . The idea wa s that we woul
d have a joint household. Th
at I would take care 
of my aunts in return for not havi
ng to pay rent and this and that 
and the other. My aunt's  son was 
going to take care of them. This was the arrangeme nt
. I could never do that be
cause already at that 
time, I was not well enough to take 
care of two old ladies plus a chil
d and a husband. It was just not 
possible. So other arrangements were ma de for th
em. It was a good thing because in 1950 we had to 
go in a sanitarium so the two old ladies would have 
been at loose ends anyhow
. So they lived till 19 -- 
Mrs. Goldstein lived, I think, until 1962 and my othe
r aunt , also a Traub, lived until 1969. She died at 
99 years and two months and was fully aware of he
r surroundings. She was not senile for a mi nute. 
She was very aware that we were ready to go to 
the moon, which for her represented an unbelievable 
thing having been born in 1869 with the gas lamp
. Imagine the whole revo
lution -- the industrial 

18
revolutions that she had lived th
rough plus the trip to the moon. 
 
Anthony: 
It struck me  that your aunt and your grandm
other that you had fa mily me mbers who lived 
long lives when they had the chance? 

 
Hanna:
 Yes, very long lives. 
 

Anthony: 
You talked about your reaction to
 the end of the war, the loss of your brother and family 
me mbers. I imagine as the war ends, you're 
finding out more infor mation about other--? 

 
Hanna:
 We ll, all my fa mily me mbers who were de
ported from Gurs did not come  back. The only 
ones who came back wer e  my cousins in Prague, 
Czechoslovakia who had first been deported to 
Theresienstadt, into Auschwitz. I think I me nti
oned it at the beginning of the tape. She and her 
husband both survived Theresienstadt, Auschwitz
, and I don't know how many other slave labor 
camps. They had an arrangeme nt that
 if they survive, they would go 
back to Prague and meet at the 
house of certain friends. Indeed, th
ey both survived, and when she cam
e back to Prague and she went 
to these friends, her husband was sitti
ng there. It's a mi racle that they
 survived. That was -- they're the 
only two other than my self and my t wo old aunts. So five people all told survived. We  lost fourteen, I 

think the total was fourteen. A disaster, yes. 
 
Anthony: 
You have any furt
her reflections? 
 

Hanna:
 I would say that in spite of 
it all, life has been good to us. 
 
Anthony: 
(static) continue to be good and perhaps be be
tter. Those were the ye
ars of the 20th century 
and the closing mo me nts of this tape. The gleam in
 your eyes suggest to me  that you have more to 
add. Why don't we take a brief break while I add a ne
w tape to the machine and then we will continue 
on the new tape. 
 
Tape Two  
 
Hanna:
 Reme mber I told you at the time we we re in
 the refugee home on Motrick (c.11), to be 
precise in (unclear) Switzerland, I ha
d to leave the home because I was under a different status, that of 
immi grant and not refugee, which left the baby in the home. Eventually, of cour
se, they allowed me to 
come  back to the home. In return, I had to pay fo
r room and board at the same  a mount  of money or 
the same  a mount of money that the Swiss had to pay. 
I think it was five or eight francs a day. Now, 
you're probably wondering how come we had the mone
y to pay that. I also told you that I had a 
brother who was in the American army and was killed 
in the Battle of the Bulge. He had made a life 
insurance before he went ove
rseas. Hi s life insurance was $10,000. 
It was paid out in monthly 
installments of $50 over -- I think 
a twenty-year period, as a ma tter of
 fac t . This $50 allowed us, ma de 
it possible for us to pay for my room and board in th
e refugee home. So I  forgot
 to explain that to you 
where the money came from so we c ould pay this room and board. 

 

19
Anthony: 
Well, I remember when we were talking earlier that ther e were other family me mbers that 
we hadn't talked about yet. Hard to 
believe that there are other fa mily 
me mbers we didn't  talk abut yet, 
but the Monee family, these were your mother
's cousins, your mother's first cousins? 
 
Hanna:
 Yes, he was my mother's first cousin. His 
name was HeindrichMone
e. His wife Paula and 
his sister Jeannette. They were de
ported with us to Gurs at the sa
me  time. Paula was already really 
starting to go into a depression in Germany, and 
had all sorts of peculiar 
ideas. She accused my 
mother and her sisters of being responsible for them not having been 
able to go to Israel, not being 
able to emigrate to Israel. Whic
h was, of course, total fabricati
on. Neither my mother nor my aunts 
had any influence or whatever for them to leave or 
not to leave. It was some thing that got into her 
head and she, I can understand, wanted to go to Israel
 to be with her two sons, one from a previous 
ma rriage. She was left widowed, then ma rried this 
cousin of my mother. Of course, her second son 
who was also in Israel and then of course, came 
to deportation and we found ourselves in Gurs. The 
poor woma n really went into a very
 deep depression to the point wher
e she wouldn't really take care 
of herself. There were weeks on end where she would 
not speak to anyone in the family. It was really 
very hard. She did come  to the funeral of my aunt 
when my oldest aunt died. I think she mi ght also 
have come  to my grandmother's funeral. Incidental
ly, while we speak of fune
rals, let me give you a 
description of a funeral in Gurs. 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, ? 
 

Hanna:
 The funerals in Gurs -- the bodies were ever
y morning collected in each block. When I first 
came across this, there were two or three men wh
o would come  with a truck, an open truck. They 
would come  into the office and sort of kick open 
the door with their shoe 
and come  in and say, you 
got some thing?  Meaning, do you have any bodies?  Wh
en I heard that for the first time, French 
speaking, I was absolutely shocked. You know, that 
you could speak of people like that. But I guess 
when you do this kind of work ever
y day, it become s sort of routine. 
 
Anthony: 
These were French? 
 

Hanna:
 No, they were refugees as well. 
 

Anthony: 
Refugees? 
 

Hanna:
 Yes, it was all done by refugees. The bodies we
re then taken down to the hospital and they 
were put in caskets, very simple caskets, like you w ould in a Jewish funeral. Just six boards. Then the 

funeral -- we had a cemetery which rapidl y filled up. 
The graves were dug and since it was winter and 
mud and rain, the caskets literally we re swimmi ng. 
They plunged down into the water, went down for 
a second and then came back up and were swimmi ng on 
top of the water. It was the most awful sight 
you could ever have imagined. First, falling into the water, the water splashing up and then the casket 

comi ng up a gain on top of the water. Then of course
, it was covered by earth. 
But the funerals were 
really some thing, you wouldn't want to really experience. Now Paula Monee mi ght have come  to my 

grandmother's funeral, I do not reme mber. But she de
finitely came to my  aunt's funeral. Maybe she 

20
even said a word or two to the fa
mily, but basically she was in such 
a deep depression that she could 
not speak to them. Still and always 
was the idea, you are responsible fo
r me being here. It's your fault 
we couldn't emigrate. 
 
Anthony: 
How far back would these accusations go? 
 

Hanna:
 They started in Germany in 19--early '39. 
 

Anthony: 
A fter Kristallnacht? 
 

Hanna:
 After Kristallnacht. The woma n was totally de
sperate. Unfortunately, she eventually had a 
granddaughter who was me ntally also not very stab
le. Only about eight years ago, committed suicide. 

So there must have been some thing. Heinrich Mon
ee, he was a very nice person, a very good-natured 
person. I liked him quite a bit as an uncle. I rea
lly did because he was very good-natured and very 
nice, you know, just a nice guy too
... 
There was a sister, Jeannette Mone
e, she worked for my aunts in 
the business. She was the bookkeeper and general o
ffice ma nager, if you wish. She was with us in 
Gurs. She was then taken to anot
her camp. After all, she was an el
derly person, and she survived. She 
survived in France and after the war, went back 
to Germany to live in a 
Jewish old-age home in 
Frankfurt. This old-age home  exis
ted already before the Hitler time
 and during the Hitler time . She 
went back there, probably, very simply because  sh
e could have  there a life, a comfortable life. She 

was entitled to her social security
 in Germany. While in France, she didn't  have a penny, and whatever 
little money she had, she probably got from some rela
tives in Switzerland. So that she was this way, 
independent. I cannot blame her for having gone 
back to Germany under these circumstances. 
 
Anthony: 
Now Heinrich and Paula we
re eventually deported? 
 

Hanna:
 Heinrich and Paula were deported from Gurs to
 Auschwitz. I believe they were also deported 
only four days after my mother
, around the 10th of August, 1942. 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, that's –? (c.88) 
 

Hanna:
 Yes. 
 

Anthony: 
I thought of some  more questions regarding Gu
rs, and am very glad that you reme mbe r ed 
to describe the funerals. When 
you were describing your uncle and your
 obvious affection for him, it 
occurred to me  how sad it must have been that you 
were kept separate -- you we
re kept separate fr om 
the me n, so you.... 

 
Hanna:
 Yeah. The woman and children were separate
 from t he me n. Once the boys we re fourteen 
years old, they had to go into th
e blocks where the me n were -- in the me n's blocks. Whether they had 
a father or a relative there or not
. In other words, at fourteen, th
ey were taken away from their 
mothers. They had to go with the me n. 

 

21
Anthony: 
So I had the vision of you separated from one of 
your dearest uncles and forced to be with 
this complaining, depressed aunt. 
 
Hanna:
 We ll, she was in another barracks 
but it was difficult. I mean, you 
tried to talk to her, to be 
nice to her. After all, she was fa mily, a
nd here wa s this totally depressed person. 
 
Anthony: 
What was it like to live in Gurs? You were ther e for quite a while. 
 

Hanna:
 Eleven months. Very difficult, extremely difficu
lt. The sanitary conditions were impossible. I 
don't know i f I me ntioned it before. There was a lo
t of illness. There was a tremendous amount of 
dysentery. We had no me
dications whatsoever. 
 

Anthony: 
What kind of food did they give you? 
 

Hanna:
 The food -- well, in the morning we would get what passed as coffee. We  got a ration of 
bread, about two and a half pounds a day. 

 
Anthony: 
Per person? 
 

Hanna:
 No, excuse me . Half a pound of bread, some thing like that. 
 

Anthony: 
Quarter of a kilo? 
 
Hanna:
 Some thing like that. Lunchtime we would have
 a soup, ma ybe with some  vegetables in it. 
Maybe with some chick peas in it. Occasionally, a li
ttle piece of meat. In the evening, it was basi cally 
the same  thing. Very occasionally, we would be give
n a small portion of brown sugar. It was the fi rst 
time I had seen brown sugar, was in France. The ve
ry beginning, we didn't ge
t any soap. I think we 
got later on a little bi
t of soap. Living conditions were veryhard. The worst thing really was the mud, 
the incessant rain in winter, the 
mud, the barracks that were leaking so when you were lying down, the 
water would drip down. If you were lucky, some one had taken along ma ybe an umbrella. The 
umbrella would be hung upside down into
 the rafters to catch the rain. So
 that was very nice as long it 
lasted. But then came the morning. You had to empty out the damn thing and when you took it down, 

more likely than not, it would spill. You know, 
it sounds funny today, it wasn't  at the time  though. 
Especially when it was always 
damp and nothing would dry. You know, it was... No heat in the 
barracks, was always cold in winter
. There was a stove in a barracks bu
t nothing to heat with or  very 
little. [Male voice: "We forgot to me ntion–it is do
cume nted that a portion of the mone y which was 
allotted by the French governme nt for food never reac
hed us because it wa s stolen before we ever got 
food for it."] 
 
Anthony: 
Sounds like you were a very resourceful---? 
 

Hanna:
 The people in Gurs became very resour ceful, yes. You had to be. For one thing, tin cans, 
large tin cans, oh about fifteen inches high and maybe 
six inches in diame t er were turned into ovens. 

22
Cooking stoves if you wish, wh
atever you want to call it. 
 
Anthony: 
Portable stoves? 
 

Hanna:
 Like a portabl
e stove, right. 
 

Anthony: 
How were they put togeth
er?  Can you describe it? 
 

Hanna:
 They were not put together. The top was cut 
open obviously because whatever was in there 
had been emptied out. You simply put opened on th
e bottom like a little openi
ng so you could put in 
some  wood. The pot you put on, the littl
e pots that we -- they're not really pots, they we re like me ss 
kits from the army. They had little hands on each side
. So they were hanging over the edge of the tin 
can and that would hold them in pl
ace. Sometimes if there was a little 
wire, they would put some  wi re 
on the bottom in order to put the wood on there so 
it would have some draft from the  bottom up not 
unlike a gr ate in the firepl ace so there would be some
 draft. And so whatever people could get hold of 
if they had a little money and could do ma ybe a littl
e black ma rketing with the Spaniards, they would 
cook on these ma keshift stoves. It worked. 
 
Anthony: 
People in your barracks used them? 
 

Hanna:
 Certainly. Whoever could afford to get a hold 
of one. Usually you had to pay a little mo ney 
to get it. 

 

Anthony: 
These weren't home made? They were made by ---? 
 

Hanna:
 They were all made in Gurs. They were ma
de by the me n. The Spaniards ma de them. They 
earned a little money that way. 

 
Anthony: 
The Spanish pr isoners? 
 

Hanna:
 The Spanish prisoners, yes. They ma de a li
ttle mone y that way, you know. I guess they also 
found most of those tincans,
 you know. It was a way of if you had 
a little money to add some thing to 
what you were given in the camp.  Now some  people 
did get money on a fairly 
regular basis in Gurs 
from relatives. The money would be paid out, what
ever the amount was. That led to a tremendous 
inflation in the black ma rket. So that we found ou
rselves in the situation 
where only a certain amount 
of money twice a month would be paid out to limit 
the amount of money that was available to people. 

So the black ma rket or the infl
ation of the black ma rket couldn'
t go even higher. The ones who had 
very little money or who got very little money from
 the outside were not to
tally shut out from buyi ng 
some  food, right, or whatever was ava
ilable. Also we instituted at that
 time a percentage of whatever 
money you got had to be put in a welfare fund. Idon't re me mber what the percentage was, ma ybe 

10% or whatever, I really don't re me mber that. Bu
t it had to be collected fr om everyone who got 
money and was given to the people who had no m
oney whatsoever, who had no relatives who could 
afford to send them any money or had no relatives
 on the outside. So they also could have a few 

23
pennies in their pockets to buy some
t hing to add to their diet, what
ever was available. Some  people 
kicked a lot when they had to give up a couple of 
percentages of what they got. My poor mother was 
in charge of collecting this money in the barracks 
and there was always a ha ssle about this especially 
from some people. But as a whole, 
it was done well and 
it was a necessity. 
 
Anthony: 
Socialism is not dead? 
 

Hanna:
 It wa s not dead, no. 
 

Anthony: 
There were reluctant soci
alists in the barracks? 
 

Hanna:
 There was some  reluctance, yes. It's funny 
enough, it's always the same  thing. The ones who 
got the most money, kicked the most. 

 
Anthony: 
Kicked the most, yeah. And probably complained too? 
 

Hanna:
 Yes. 
 

Anthony: 
How about like with these portable stoves
?  Those who had them, was it possible for 
some one who didn't have portable 
stove to use some one else's ?  
 
Hanna:
 Oh, sure. That was not, you know, that was not 
a problem. When I finish, you can have it. 
That was not... 
 
Anthony: 
So they were shared? 
 

Hanna:
 Yeah. 
 

Anthony: 
The food that was cooked. Obviously it was 
possible to prepare your own food and this 
would have been smuggled? 

 
Hanna:
 We ll, prepared -- whatever you got, you ma de 
some t hing out of it, you know. When we left 
Germany, my aunt went into the kitchen to get 
some  food, which she had 
never in her life done --
cooked. She didn't know anything about cooking. What 
she took, she thought it was sugar. Actually, it 
turned out to be farina. That was 
a much better deal to have the farina because you could ma ke sort of 
a porridge out of it, if you wished. Sure it was only 
water, right, but it was at
 least some thing. So that 
lasted for a little while. Maybe
, you could later on buy a can of m
ilk or you got some  food packages 
from some where, which we could receive. You used 
whatever was in there a
nd ma de meals out of it. 
Meals is an exaggeratio
n, some  additional food. 
 
Anthony: 
You had some  amateur cooks that were---? The image now is not one of people cooking 
every night -- it's not like your American
 barbecue and Fourth of July, right? 
 

24
Hanna:
 No, no, absolutely not. It was 
an occasional thing. It was not– 
 
Anthony: 
These are not heavily used? 
 

Hanna:
 No, it was not a daily thing. 
It was an occasional thing. 
 

Anthony: 
Very occasional. 
 

Hanna:
 Right. [Male voice: ﬁSo occasiona
l that I really don't have a reco
llection that my mother ever 
cooked."] 

 
Anthony: 
Did the men do it? 
 

Hanna:
 Less. 
 

Anthony: 
Less. We re these portable stoves present in the me n's section? 
 
Hanna:
 ["Some  of the m, yeah. But I mean, you know, 
mostly it was a man who acquired it from the 
Spanish and it ended up in the wome n's barracks.ﬁ] 

 
Anthony: 
Yeah, could you estimate how many of th
ese were in use, just  estimate? 
 

Hanna:
 No way. 
 
Anthony: 
No way? 
 

Hanna:
 No way. 
 

Anthony: 
Not even between the two of you, you couldn't? 
 

Hanna:
 No, I really couldn't estimate 
how ma ny of thes
e ma keshift... 
 

Anthony: 
What would be a mi ni mum number that
 you would have seen or smelled? 
 

Hanna:
 I really couldn't tell. Whatever I would tell 
you mi ght not be right. And so I rather not put 
myself down to a number. 

 
Anthony: 
They wer e  t h er e? 
 

Hanna:
 They wer e  t h er e. 
 

Anthony: 
At least a handful? 
 

25
Hanna:
 Oh, yeah. You will even fi nd pictur es and I am sure the museum has some pictures of these 
stoves. There is a woma n sitting in fr ont of
 one of these doing whatever cooking she can. 
 
Anthony: 
So it was possible to get warm f
ood but only if you did it yourself. 
 

Hanna:
 Occasionally, occasionally. [" We  got war m food 
the only thing is what quality was the food 
we got. "] 

 
Anthony: 
And the quantity? 
 

Hanna:
 Non-existent. [" And the quantity. Th
e nutritional value was non-existent.ﬂ] 
 

Anthony: 
These empty cans, these large cans you're talk
ing about, by any chance, 
could these be cans 
of food that had been sent to
 the camp for the prisoners? 
 
Hanna:
 It could have been food. 
We ll they were rather large as I desc
ribed. It could be that they were 
cans that came  into the so-called kitchen whic
h was like a field kitche
n, an open thing with, you 
know. That ma ybe some  canned food came into these k
itchens, I do not reme mber it but it is possible. 
["I rather suspect that most of these cans cam
e from the French personnel and the Spanish–"] 
 
Anthony: 
Prisoners? 
 
Hanna:
 ["No, sanitation detail just pi
cked them up wherever they f
ound them and didn't  throw them 
away but kept them for..."] 
 
Anthony: 
Recycling? 
 

Hanna:
 ["Recycling."] Ever
ything was recycled. 
 

Anthony: 
You never saw any of these cans with the orig
inal label on them?  They had already been 
stripped of their labels? 

 
Hanna:
 Wh atever  it was, it was stripped. But they we
re around and they did help and when anything 
was available, they were used. 

 
Anthony: 
Real kitchens were not available? 
 

Hanna:
 Real kitchens? No. There was -- in each bl
ock was a field kitchen and that was it. 
 

Anthony: 
Did anyone, to your knowledge, bring portable 
kitchens?  I know it's 
been said that... 
 

Hanna:
 No. No portable stove was brought. A lot of 
peculiar things were taken along like coffee 
mills. I me a n, the most impossible things were taken along. No. 

26
 
Anthony: 
There was no opportunity, for example ,
 to use electrical appliances?
 
 
Hanna:
 Absolutely not. Absolutely not. 
 

Anthony: 
This is a very, very primitive--? 
 

Hanna:
 There was electricity in each
 barracks but there was no -- there wouldn't have been a hookup 
for anything. ["Don't forget in thos
e days, electrical appliances were 
much less frequent than they are 
today."] 
 
Anthony: 
That's  right, yes, yes. 
 

Hanna:
 You had no electrical– ["You had no electrical 
appliances, so to spea
k, especially not heavy 
appliances."] There was no such thing, there was 
ma ybe -- ma ybe some  pe ople took along a little field 
thing. You know, like you have -- fed by, what is
 this stuff called, it come s in a can --.ﬂ 
 

Anthony: 
Propane? 
 
Hanna:
 No, little cans. ["There were lit
tle drops of (unclear?) (c.242)"] 
It was like dried alcohol. It 
was like little bars of dried alc
ohol that you would ignite and ma ybe
 one other person had taken one 
of those little things but 
they usually only were for a cup or two, 
at most. [ﬁEventually, other fuel ran 
out."] Then there was no more. But to say that an
yone brought along any sort
 of cooking facility, 
appliances, or whatever, that is si
lly. Just plain silly, that's  plain 
silly and not thought
 out. Because if 
you're being deported you don't think of these things
. Surely people grabbed 
peculiar stuff but not 
that, you know–like the one woma n who had taken along a coffee mill. Now what in the heck she 

grabbed that heavy coffee mill for, it was a Tu
rkish one at that, a brass one, you know, I mean 
ridiculous. [" Don't forge t  most people didn't have mo
re than two hours time  to get their stuff together 
and pack."] 
 
Anthony: 
You were an exception? 
 

Hanna:
 [" I was an exception."] 
 

Anthony: 
How did they wake you up in the morni
ng at camp?  Particular wake-up time ? 
There was no--? 

 
Hanna:
 Oh, yes. In the beginning th
ere was a supervising person w
ho came  into the barracks and 
counted heads. God forbid if one of the kids ha
d slipped under the blanket and the number didn't 
come  up right. 
 
Anthony: 
So they counted you in your beds? 
 

27
Hanna:
 In the beginning, yes. 
 
Anthony: 
And these were beds or bunks? 
 

Hanna:
 No, no, no. We  were on the floor. 
 

Anthony: 
On the floor? 
 

Hanna:
 We  were on the floor. She was a very nasty 
person. She would come  in in the morning and 
count heads around 6:30, 7:00 o'cloc
k. When we had small children with us in the barracks. You 

know how s mall kids are. They are covered up to 
over their heads and she wouldn't immediately see 
them. She would be furious if she didn't come  ou
t to the right count, and she would go over it and 
over it till she had all the numbers right. 
 
Anthony: 
These were wooden floors? 
 

Hanna:
 Wo oden floors. The barracks were wood. They 
were only covered with tar paper, nothing 
else. That's  why we had so ma ny leaks. No, we we
re on the floor. We  were on straw. Open straw in 
the beginning, they just had bales 
of straw in the beginning when we
 arrived. Later on they gave us 
some thing to stuff the straw in, to ma ke 
some thing that was a kin to a ma ttress. 
 
Anthony: 
More like a stable for animals than a bedroom?  
 
Hanna:
 Exactly, absolutely. In the beginning we were
 about 60 people per barr
acks. Later on, it sort 
of thinned out. 

 
Anthony: 
Then how did people go to sleep?  Did they just
 lie down and fall asl
eep or  was there an 
hour, a mo ment when everything was--? 

 
Hanna:
 I guess around ten o'clock or so, everybody, especi
ally in winter, was ready to– [" Wa sn't the 
light shut off? "] No, the light was not s
hut off during the night. The light was on. 
 
Anthony: 
All night? 
 

Hanna:
 They were on, at least one wa s on in the 
barracks so you could sort of... But around 10, I 
should think, 10, 11 o'clock, people sort of trie
d to go to sleep. You 
know, whatever sleep... 
 
Anthony: 
How ma ny muddy feet did you have to walk
 to get to the to
ilet facilities? 
 
Hanna:
 [ﬁThat depended on the location of the barracks.
"] Barracks, depends. Some  were very close 
to the latrine, some were rather  far away so it wa
s... ["I was in the barrack, 
for instance, where I coul d 

go on the rear and be closer to the latrine."] We  we
re sort of in the mi ddle of the block so we had 
quite a hike. [My mother was also in the mi
ddle of the block."] So it was quite a hike. 

28
 
Anthony: 
Did resourcefulness enable you to deal with th
e mud problem, that is walking?  Footwear?  
Were you able to--? 
 
Hanna:
 We ll, in the beginning, we had our own shoes. 
 

Anthony: 
They were not designed 
for this kind of hiking? 
 

They were not designed for that 
sort of thing and you would sink in 
and they would be, of course, full 
of mud. You would go and ma ybe wh
en the water was running and wash them off and put them 
some where to dry out. If you were stupid enough to
 hang them on the fence as I did once, they 
disappeared. So I lost a good pair of shoes that wa
y in the very beginning. [" Th
at was irreplaceable."] 
Irrepl aceable. 
 
Anthony: 
What did you replace them with? 
 

Hanna:
 I had other shoes and when I worked in the office... 
 

Anthony: 
Because you had brought another pair with you
?  Otherwise -- what if -- maybe you even 
knew of some one -- what if you didn't
 have shoes?  What if your shoes had been stolen or they we re 
worn out, did anyone ma ke provisions? 
 
Hanna:
 Not that I can reme mber. Now in the... I worked
 in the office after some  ti me , and I was a 
me ssenger and stuff for the office. Each block has its own office which then had to report to 
headquarters. They had a pair of 
rubber boots. I don't know how they
 had acquired them but they had 
a pair of rubber boots. So wh
en I had to run the errands... 
 
Anthony: 
You could borrow them?  
 

Hanna:
 I had these to get around in. 
 

Anthony: 
You had to return them? 
 

Hanna:
 Absolutely. They stayed there. 
 

Anthony: 
Now given the lateness of the year, when you were deported, imagine that people took 
winter coats with them? 

 
Hanna:
 Yes, most people had taken wi
nter clothes and no matter how 
much we had, we were still 
cold. No ma tter how ma ny layers we ma naged to put 
on, we were still cold because it was damp a nd it 
Gurs through everything. So that
 the clothes never wa
s really dry. You know, this dampness went 
through everything some how. 

 

29
Anthony: 
How was laundry done? 
 
Hanna:
 Laundry was done whenever the water was r
unning. There were some  troughs which in the 
beginning we re troughs where we had to wash, out 
in the open. Later on the wome n, at least, had a 
barracks with running water. ["We never did."] There were some ... 
 
Anthony: 
Men did not have--. 
 

Hanna:
 It wa s simply a long basin probably about twofeet across and ma ybe si
x, eight feet long. It 
was tin-lined. Above it was a pipe and simply had hol
es in it so the water would come out along these 
holes and the holes were placed pr obably eight, te
n inches apart, some thing like that. There was the 
water comi ng out of both sides of the pipe. That was 
our facility to wash. But 
at least it was indoors, it 
was closed. We weren't standing in full view of the 
ma in street of the camp which the me n always had 
to do. The troughs that we re outside, they were woode
n troughs, we used that 
to wash the laundry. So 

it was always a fight who was going to get the tro
ugh to put the laundry in th
ere to wash. Since we 
had very little soap, we sort of soaked the laundry 
and let it soak before we would use soap to wash it. 
It was a hardship, especially in winter when it wa
s cold. The water was ice-cold. Water was limited to 
three times a day for about two hours. So it was very difficult. 

 
Anthony: 
And you would line-dry the ---? 
 

Hanna:
 We  would line-dry. On the barbed wire, we w
ould line-dry our belongi
ngs and stay with it. 
Otherwise, bye-bye. 
 
Anthony: 
Stolen?  Socialism has a way of becoming robbery? 
 

Hanna:
 Right. Look, some  people came with very little
. The Spanish people who were in the camp 
for years had very little. So ... 

 
Anthony: 
You were rich compared to them? 
 

Hanna:
 We  were rich compared to them in ma ny wa
ys. They had ma ny more small children that we 
had, in comparison. ["They were too much younger."]
 They were much younger, of course, we were 
an over-aged group of people basically, you know. 
Because most of the young people, whoever could 
had left Germany, right, and left behind were
 a small group of young people, a small group of 
children but mostly over-age people. 
 
Anthony: 
In fact, I still reme mber your descripti
on of the deportation --
 you and six old wome n. 
 

Hanna:
 Five old. 
 

Anthony: 
Being escorted by how many guards? 
 

30
Hanna:
 Twelve. 
 
Anthony: 
Twelve guards. 
 

Hanna:
 Twelve guards with six helpless wome n. 
 

Anthony: 
Was the water drinkable? 
 

Hanna:
 The water in camp, yes. 
We  could drink the water. 
 

Anthony: 
This came from the Pyrenees? 
 

Hanna:
 No. The water could -- you know there's a lot 
of water in France you 
cannot drink but the 
water in Gurs, you could drink it. There was no pr
oblem there. ["It probably came  down from the 
mountains."] I have no idea where it came from. Ther
e was a water tank, very 
high up, as a ma tter of 
fact and insufficient, insufficient for the amount of 
people. That's why we were so limited with water. 
There is a picture of Gurs, I'm sure you have seen 
it. It is actually taken from that water tower. 
 

Anthony: 
The water had better be drinkable since 
they were probably not serving wine. 
 

["No. "] 
 
Hanna:
 Hardly. 
 
Anthony: 
You never saw anybody drinking wine, right? 
 
["Oh, I wouldn't say that. I am sure that I saw in 
the hospital. Particularly
 when I was down there. 
The French personnel had access to wine."] 

 
Anthony: 
Of course, yeah, yeah. 
 

Hanna:
 Not the refugees, not the prisoners. ["Neithe
r would we spend the money on some thing as 
frivolous as wine."] Look, in the 
beginning when we came to Gurs, we left Germany with 100 ma rks 
which was exchanged to us for 2,000 francs, right?  
In the very beginning, when we came, my mot her 
had a chance to buy one egg from a Spanish woma n. This one egg was 15 francs, okay. You have 

2,000 francs. One egg was 15 francs. You think a
nyone would spend money on anything frivolous. 
 

Anthony: 
No, although the French would not co
nsider wine to be frivolous. 
 

["No."] 
 
Anthony: 
Can you give us some  more idea of whatthe prices were?  Do you reme mber other 
purchases? 

31
 
Hanna:
 No, I don't really. But this really stuc
k in my mi nd that 15 francs for one egg. 
 
Anthony: 
The 2,000 francs are not going to last very long? 
 

Hanna:
 No, no. 
 

Anthony: 
Especially if you have to buy a stove? 
 

Hanna:
 Or whatever. ["Eventually we had canteens."]
 They were started by the Spanish. They were 
run by the Spanish in our block. ["In your block. In 
our block we started our 
own. We  had one in the 
hospital which was run by Franken where you could buy some stuff–"] 
 
Anthony: 
You mean Mr. Franken?  Lily™s ? 
 

Hanna:
 Lily's husband. ["I was able to help hi m to 
get this which gave him some little income. You 
could buy certain things like cans of beans at mo
re reasonable prices th
an the black ma rket."] 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, even cruddy prices on the sardines?   
 

Hanna:
 No, but in our block, in Block K, the cant
een that existed when we came was run by the 
Spanish wome n. The way we talked to them, actua
lly my aunt, Helena Goldstein, spoke a fluent 

Italian, and so she could d
eal with the Spanish women. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, they'r e close enoug
h, Italian and Spanish. 
 

Hanna:
 She ma naged, and that's the way my aunt 
would, you know, ma nage to speak to them and 
deal with them. What the others did, I don't 
know. I guess with hand and any old way. Eventually, 
everyone learned a couple of words of Spanish a
nd they learned a couple of words of German, or 
French or... 

 
Anthony: 
French above all, right? 
 

Hanna:
 We ll, there were not too ma ny among us  who spoke French. I know and some of us were 
reluctant to learn French but eventually we all di d,
 didn't we?  They had to, we all had to. ["Those of 
us who did speak French were some what--had an
 advantage."] Had an advantage, defi nitely. 
 

Anthony: 
The stubborn ones who didn't want to lear
n French learned eventually, right? 
 

Hanna:
 Yes. Their life depended on it, eventually. ["
The trouble you had if you spoke French was to 
acquire a sufficient amount of knowledge of the local 
dialect. Because a lot of
 the people who worked 
there were locals. This was not French."] 
 

32
Anthony: 
Not Parisi an Fr ench? 
 
Hanna:
 ["It wasn't  even French."] It was not literary French. It was 
not only not literary French, it 
was almost Spanish."] 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, or Casablanca– 
 

Hanna:
 Yeah, it sort of changes there. 
 

[ﬁI had an awful a mount of trouble to learn this."] 
 
Anthony: 
You thought you knew French, and you found out that you had to re-learn it? 
 

Hanna:
 He did, he did. 
 

Anthony: 
No, but I mean he had to re-learn that French. 
 

["At the time I left there, we communicated very well."] 
 
Anthony: 
And then you had to go back to your more litera
ry form of French when you finally got to 
Switzerland? 

 
["Yeah."] 

 
Hanna:
 But you know... Even that Fr ench is a little bit different, isn't it? 
 
["Sure. That French is slightly different but not 
like Spanish."] Like in any country, regionally the 
language changes. ["But by and larg
e, the personnel in the Swiss 
internme nt compl e xes -- we had 
German Swiss, not French Swiss."] 
 
Anthony: 
They spoke 
Volksdeutsch
? 
Hanna:
 No, they spoke German. 
Swissdeutsch
. But they know proper Germ
an, they're being taught 
proper German in school. They don't  like to speak it be
cause it's a little foreign to them but there was 
no problem there. 

 
Anthony: 
Well, this is a lengthy postscri pt. 
 

Hanna:
 We  reme mbered everything? I hope so. 
 

["I hope so."] 
 
Anthony: 
Well, on that note I wish to thank you for.... 
 

33
Hanna:
 You're very welcome. 
 
Anthony: 
We thank you.
