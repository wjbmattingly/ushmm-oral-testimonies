A: I am the oldest one, my sist
er is six and a half years younger,
 so I was the only child for six 
and a half years. 
Q: So that means you have an only child perspective, almost. 

A: Ob-Obviously. 

Q: What did your dad do? 

A: My dad was a journalist in a Jewish newspa
per that a group of young me n got together and 
for med a cooperative, and it was a daily Jewish newspaper. 

Q: And was that -- that was his 
profession, to be a journalist? 
A: Right. Actually, what they di
d, it was -- at that  time it was right
 after the first war -- war, and 
of course I was not there and don™t reme mb
er anything of that, just by stories. 
Q: Right. 

A: My father was, to start with, a very active l
eader in unionization right
 after the war. And he 
helped to establish the union of 
printers in Lódz. Now, a [indeciphe
rable] statement is that Lódz 
was the second largest city in Po
land, Wa rsaw was the 
capital, Lódz was the industrial city, and 
it was called the Polish Manchester
. And the -- really the only indus
trial city in Poland, which 
meant that it was also a city of social and 
political fer ment. The union -- uni -- birth of the 
unions, the workers mo veme nt etcetera, and I wa
s born in that atmosphere. A big city comi ng 
into being as a substantial industr
ial city, in a Poland that was mos
tly, or only agricultural before. 
The city -- the population of the c
ity consisted of sort of three 
parts. Pol -- Poles, Jews, and 
Germans. The industrial trend was comi ng from th
e west, so the Germans were a very important 
element, establishing all kinds of industrial complexes, but the ma inthing how this textile 

business came to be, is through -- I don™t know th-t
he name  would it be -- for people working at 
the loom in their own apartments. So they would be home workers, and when you -- when I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
3 
 
going to school, from my home  to my school, 
I would pass ma ny homes wh
ere on the first floor 
you could hear the click of the l
ooms, one after another and you sa
w me n sitting in the loom and 
working. That -- that was the basi c thing, what built, you know, industry in Lódz. And then of 
course, the -- were the big ma
nufacturing things and Germans, it was mostly in German hands, 
big, you know, big stores, and big 
commerce, led mostly by Germans and Jews and Poles. So it 
was a three part city that lived pr etty
 much in peace til the war broke out. 
Q: What was your home  like?  Wa  -- di
d your mo ther work, by the way?   
A: No. 

Q: No. So she was home? 

A: Yes, she was home , she was a home maker. My father worked, and that is how I sort of 

learned first hand from my mother about femi nism
. She never used the name , neither did I, but 
looking back when I got in touch with my fe mi ni
sm in modern times here, in America, I was 

recalling that where I -- where 
I got it from. And I don™t know,
 life was good, and I knew that. 
Why?  Because I was very observant, and I wa
s, you know, had ma ny friends, and visited, and 
revisited. And also each time when I went to an
other home, my mother was drilling me , what did 
you see, what was the furniture
, who lived there, etcetera. 
Q: Really? 

A: So I had to pay attention to all that, to 
give mother a report. So -- but I also saw the 
relationship, you know, in the homes, and I alwa
ys came back and ti -- 
this time that the 
relationship were the best in my home, betw
een my parents and between my parents and 
children. But i -- so what she was saying about 
her life was some ti me s she got very a -- not 
some ti me s, very often, she was very angry. 
She was also very laughing and singing, you know, 
so all -- all emotions were just
 on the surface. And she would sa
y, when she was angry with my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
4 
 
father a little too much, I would say, ﬁMother, 
what do you want?  Don™t you realize you have the 
best husband, and I have the best father? ﬂ  She says
, ﬁI realize that, but look
 at his life and look at 
my life. He gets up, I fix breakfast, he eats, he 
gets dressed. I see that 
he™s properly dressed and 
go -- he goes to work outside, for fun. What 
do I do?  I clean, I cook, I clean, I cook, I shop and 
clean and cook. And I woul
d like to work, I would like to be 
in the outside world.ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁ Why aren™t you? ﬂ Because I cannot.
 You know, she was the daughter 
of a pretty well to do -- a 
construction -- a builder, he was building houses. A
nd before the w -- first war, they were quite 
well-to-do. After the war I saw 
a lot of paper mo ney around, bags
 of paper money, and I knew 
that that™s where the mo ney went. You know, ther
e was a total wipe-out. And she says, ﬁI could 
not work, my father would never let him, it woul
d be a bad mark, if he -- his daughter, Shlomo 
Gavcewicz™s daughter would work?  Never. And now
, since I am married, if I would work, that 
would mean that your father is not capable of
 supporting a family. So I cannot do that, it would 
be hell. That™s my life. But you, you will be di ffe
rent. You will get all th
e education so that you 
can work, and life will be different
 for you.ﬂ That was my mother. 
Q: It™s very interesting. How -- do you reme mb
e r  about how old you were when you had this 
kind of a conversation? 

A: Oh, about 10 years. 

Q: About 10 years. 

A: Nine, 10 - 11. 

Q: But she didn™t seem to say this with a lot of
 bitterness, it was just very straightforward.  
A: Not at all. Straightforward. And about bitterness and anger, I -- you know, particularly when I 

became a physician and I learne d from fa milies for wome n and I notice that the bi ggest 

characteristics of wome n™s upbringi
ng was don™t be angry, cover it, 
don™t be a -- and I -- at first I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
5 
 
didn™t understand, but then I understood that those we
re the messages in this culture that families 
gave to girls. Anger is for boys, and for you, be
 nice and sweet. So, I reme mber then, you know, 
how my life -- when I was angry, 
Mother never stopped me, only let me -- let me fume , then at 
one point she says, ﬁOkay, you™re angry. How long -- 
how long will it last? ﬂ  That stopped me . In 
other word, you can get angry, it™s ok
ay with me , but don™t overdo that. 
Q: Right. 
A:  So t h at  -- t h at  was -- 

Q: So you must have been very close to her. Some what -- 

A: I was, yes.  

Q: -- yeah. 

A: And -- and without knowing, really, because sh
e was not a doting mother. For that I had my 
grandmother, her mother, you know?  My grandmot
her™s lap was always open and I can jump 
and be there, and she would cuddle me  and 
hug me . My mother did not acknowledge any of 
those things. It was all talk, 
but no close physical contact. 
Q: Really? 

A: Other than, you know, there was a habit of 
kissing the hand of mo mmy and daddy when I 
went to school. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. On -- as good-bye. 

Q: And whe n you came home , the same  thing or not? 

A: No, not. 

Q: Only the -- only good-bye? 

A: O-O-Only the good-bye, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
6 
 
Q: So your mother was not physically affec
tionate, it was your -- your grandmother. 
A: No, not physic -- no, that™s right, that I got 
from my grandmother, but
 mother always -- yo -- 
it was a subject to talk with me , explain and ask 
give, you know, encouragement, to give reports, 
to observe and so on. 
Q: And was the grandmother your mother™s mother? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And was she living in th
at house with you as well? 
A: Yes, we were living together, yes, yes. 

Q: So you had a lot of access to -- 

A: And grandfather, it was the -- my grandfathe
r™s property. It was a s -- a four story building, 
apartment building and we lived ther e together in
 a large apartment, and my grandfather was a 
good guy, he always watched as I was comi ng fr
om school, with whom I am comi ng home, 
etcetera. But ne -- also, no physical closeness.
 Only grandmother was th -- was for that. 
Grandfather I always had a good c
ontact, I could talk to him, he
 would ask me  things, but no 
physical closeness. 

Q: And wha t  about your father
?  Were you close with him? 
A: Very close. 

Q: You were. 

A: Very close, yes, ver -- we were very close.
 I was the first one, the only one for a long time -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and he was always watchf
ul. He would ma ke home work with me , a nd help me  out and he 
would read to me . And when 
I was a little older, nine, 10, 
he would bring me  books. And, you 
know, working in a newspaper, there were alwa
ys books b-brought in by 
publishers, and so on, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
7 
 
so he would bring me  samples of those books. And they were pretty advanced books, Polish 
history, and the bloody Polish hist
ory of -- you know, Poland had a very bloody history. It is a 
country that is between Germany, Russia, Austria,
 the Hapsburgs, the Prussians, and the Norse. 
And though there was a part of 
history, there was the golden age of Poland in Middle Ages, 
where Poland was quite potent a
nd -- militarily, and was attacki
ng the neighbors, and also is 
known for having the first university in Krakow
, in Europe. So it was a pretty -- you know, 
pretty acknowledged country, but bloody history, 
you know?  Like we had the significant that I 
reme mber, and there were books written, the 
Norse i-invaded, you know, the Swedes, the 
Vikings, Middle Ages, invaded Poland and run do
wn the whole country and the beautiful books 
that the author got a Nobel Prize, part of th
e flood when the Vikings flooded the whole country. 
And the atrocities and interr
ogation and punishment. The undergr
ound places where they kept 
the people that they -- you know, the invaders, bl
oody killings and so on. So I was exposed to 
that really ve ry early, so
 I knew history very well. 
Q: Did your father understand what your mother
 was si -- telling you about being independent? 
A: Oh, yes.  

Q: And he appreciated that? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: It was okay? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: But not for his wife? 

A: No, that was part of the culture. 

Q: That™s culture. 

A: Both of them would not dare for my mother to work. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
8 
 
Q: Right. But it was okay for that to be -- 
A: I had -- I had the new generation. 

Q: Uh-huh, it™s interesting. 

A: Different.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes.  

Q: Did you eat lunch together? Did your
 father come  home  for lunch? 
A: It depends, you know, he worked shifts, you know
, the ol -- the p -- th
e whole group worked 
shifts. He was a printer by -- by tr
ade, so I reme mber him working this big linotype -- this big, 
mechanical machine came from America, a
nd you know, I saw him working, and I -- I was 
fascinated by that. He also set types, he al
so wrote editorial. You 
know, there was -- everybody 
did some thing of the same  thing. 

Q: I see.  
A: I don™t -- so -- but they worked shifts, so I 
don™t know how it was lunch. When I was going to 
school I would take lunch and di
nner was always early, two o™clock, three o™clock, that was the 
main meal. We ate together, so 
everybody was at the table together. 
Q: So ma ybe that™s what I mean. I™m calling it
 lunch and I shouldn™t, 
I should call it dinner, 
because -- 
A: That™s -- that was at dinnertime. 

Q: -- you had supper -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- later. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
9 
 
Q: So your dad would be home for the dinner. 
A: When he worked that way, yes. 

Q: When he worked that way. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Wa s that -- w-was -- was th
at nice, the dinner, the convers
ation?  And were you included, or 
were you really considered a kid, so you should be very quiet? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I was included when I wanted to say some thing, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: I-It was a nice time .  

Q: And your grandmother and grandfather were -- 

A: Separate. They -- 
Q: Separate? 
A: That™s right. We  lived 
in one large apartment -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- but there were 
separate households. 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: And actually, you know, so they -- my gr
andmother was cooking for her husband, my 

grandfather, and in earlier year
s there was, you know, my aunt wa
s there, and my uncles. There 
were three -- five children, includ
ing my mother. And then they got
 -- slowly they all got married 
and left home. So they was separate -- cooke
d separately, so it was a separate household. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
10 
 
Q: In addition to being interest
ed in history, what other intere
sts did you have as a kid?  Did you 
like school? 
A: Oh, I loved school. To go -- oh, grade school,
 and high school, I lo
ved school. My biggest 
interest was natural sciences. 

Q: It was?  

A: Zoology, and bi -- bot -- botany. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes, mm-hm. And I reme mber, every summe r
 we went on vacation in the country, you know?  
That was a habit, a custom, not only for the rich by -- but mi ddle class as well, and maybe lower, 

too. You would rent a cheap place,
 or more expen -- whatever your 
finances were, in the country, 
which would be ma ybe 50 kilome ters, 30 kilome ters
 outside the city, and 
spend the summertime, 
which was a long time, it was two and a half 
months. School was out. And my father would 
come  for weekends, and we stayed, you know, ch
ildren, very often there was extended fa mily, 
cousins. So that was a wonderful life. And each 
summer, after summer, I would come  home  with 
loads of samples of leaves and -- pr essed leaves
, ple -- pressed flowers. Preserved salama nders 

and snakes, and -- you know, things like that. My 
father taught me  how t o catch snakes and 
preserve them. That was for my classes, you know. 

Q: So you caught live snakes? 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And then you killed them?  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Uh-huh, okay. And then you -- 

A: And salamanders. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
11 
 
Q: And salamanders. 
A: And frogs, yes. 

Q: Really? 

A: So I was, you know that -- every summer. Th
at was my -- my doing. And catch butterflies and 
kill them and ma ke shows of different but
terflies. It was fun. Very busy su mmers. 
Q: I can see that. And then you would 
take them to the class, and -- 
A: Oh yes, I would take them to sc
hool, and show off, and [indecipherable] 
Q: So you did a lot of work for the 
teachers, actually, without knowing it.  
A: Oh, I didn™t look 
at it like that -- 
Q: Right, I understand. 

A: -- I was just showing what
 I did during my summertime. 
Q: And the -- the other kids, you told me  you were 
friends. Were they as in
terested in school and 
study as you, or -- 
A: So me  we re. 
Q: Some . 

A: Yes. And then there were some  kids as we go
t older, got interest very much in the social 
issues, which was a burning question in Poland in
 those time s between wars. You see, to our 
right was Russia, that just  became Bolshevik Ru ssia, and that was a big experiment, and we 

couldn™t stop talking about it. 
You know, kids. Grown-ups, too, but
 it was a forbidden thing to 
even think about. Ye -- Communism was forbi
dden by the Polish reactionary governme nt, and 
other governme nts, you know, it was a sort of a new 
things, and so that wa s all discussed in hush 
with friends, so I had some  friends that were very
 interested in the quest
ion as was I, and I was 
reading to no end, all the, you know, chief write
rs of Communism, Socialism. And I know that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
12 
 
was not against what my  father was thinking, but
 we nev -- it was unspoken because if you were 
caught and went to -- the thing wa
s that the kids that were then
 caught in the -- this Communist 
spirit, and infiltration, you know, there was inf
iltration from Soviet 
Union by youths, too, and 
you could hear mur murs, you know, when we we re
 going out of school by Friday, come  to the 
meeting, come  to the meeting here and here. 
And we knew that was Communist meetings, but 
you didn™t dare to think about 
it because you could get expelle
d from school, and kids were 
getting expelled from getting involved in Communist 
cells. But the curiosity at that age is so 
strong, that I could just not -- you 
know, put it together 
aside. So we had couple kids that were 
on the same  wavelengths and we w
ould read and discuss, and discu
ss, particularly about w-what 
is -- how -- what are the best
 way to edu -- to bring up ch
ildren. And you know, part of the 
Communist agenda was to -- to -- 
to put a wedge between parents a
nd children and took away ch 
-- take away children, ofte
n to -- for separate education and so
 on. And that was dangerous stuff, 
you know, at home to talk about. But we talked ne
vertheless, and what we
 think, what would be 
better, there was endless discussi
ons. And then one time -- this fr
iend of mi ne that was mostly 
knowledgeable said, look, there is a meeting such 
and such a day, such and such a place, I have  a 
friend and he wants us to go, a-and participate 
there. So I said, ﬁYou know, Stephanie, it™s 
dangerous.ﬂ ﬁOh, who cares, come  on, let™s go.ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁOkay, we™ll go.ﬂ So we went, and that 
was the friend that took us there,
 and it was in the Polish section 
of town. Actually, it was in the 
section of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews. So we were in ther e on a little, 

small, apartment, you know, very high up, and ther
e were people around the ta
ble. It was cold, it 
was winter, it was bitter cold. And 
there was a little iron stove that 
was giving a little heat, and a 
lot of people, and so we were sitting there. 
And you know the saying is
 that poverty s-smells. 
That was just my experience, the poverty stunk there. It was so poor. People were from the very, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
13 
 
very poor population, sitting, and there was this
 guy, and this guy just came from Russia. 
Communist, propagandist, and wa
s talking, and everybody was hus
hed and listening. And he 
was talking what a great count
ry Soviet Union is, how thi
ngs are good, how poor people are 
doing well, how the regime  is taking care of poor peopl
e, etcetera, etcetera, a
nd of course they all 
listened and loved it. And, okay, so we went -- y
ou know, that was after that, went home  and I 
had all kinds of -- they were really not mi
xed feelings, I understood very well why this guy 
looked and was received like a -- as a prophet. 
You know, smelling the smell of poverty, and the 
posture of those poor people, you know, the ba
bushkas and so on. I said, we ll they are looking 
for a prophet. They have it so bad that I am not su
rprised that they are looking for that. But then I 
said, you know, as for -- later on 
I said, well, it™s not my
 life. I am not part of it. He da -- you 
know, he cannot speak to me , he did not speak 
to me . And that was it for me , you know?  The 
contact with Communism, and the 
aura of paradise, but I under
stood that. So that was this 
episode of my life. 
Q: How old were you when you went to that meeting, do you think? 
A: 14 year -- 13 - 14. But we were engaged in serious -- 

Q: Serious discussion. 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: So you were reading Ma
rx, you were reading -- 
A: Hm?  

Q: We re you reading Marx and Engels and -- 

A: Oh yes -- 

Q: -- Trotsky? 

A: -- sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
14 
 
Q: You were? 
A: Yes, and I thought Marx was great, and Enge
ls was great. Oh, no ques
tion about it. And I had 
the books and I didn™t have themopen, but I knew my parents did see them, and they did not tell 

me don™t read them. 

Q: Don™t read them. 

A: In other words, 
learn everything you can. 
Q: Right. Was -- was there any politi
cal discussion in school, or not? 
A: No. 

Q: No. Not [indecipherable] 

A: No. Forbidden. And then another interesti
ng thing. This guy whom -- my friend who brought 
my friend and me  to the cell, Communist cell, wa
s in ghetto later. I had 
no contact with him, 
nothing close, but I knew who he is. And one day 
he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his 
mother and keeping her body in his place, and 
using his -- he r ration cards to get br ead. 
Q: So he could get two rations. 
Wow. So some thing about the -- 

A: Is there a correlation or not?  But I say, well,
 okay. What can you say?  You know, that -- that 

was just some thing to -- to note about people. 

Q: Now, your father was a Bundist? 

A: I don™t think he was a -- o
fficially a Bundist, but a B
undist™s, you know, perception. 
Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh. 

A: He was not a party man. 

Q: I see. And your mother -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- agreed, but she was not -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
15 
 
A: No, not involved in any party.  
Q: So did you discuss politics with your parent
s? I understand you didn™t 
discuss the Communist 
st uff. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But did you discuss politics in other ways? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: All the time. My father was in --  at the newspaper. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right?  And he al -- always 
was bringing news from the -- from the first sort of thing. And 
there was always a lot of discussion about anti
-Semitism in t he government, and what they are 
doing. And the big discussion was in the Parliame nt
 about the Jewish ques
tion and the way that 
Jews, they killed the animals. You 
know, for food, what do you call that? 
Q: Oh, Kaszrut rules, you mean? 

A: Kaszrut --  ritual ki lling. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Right?  

Q: Yes.  

A: And if the governme nt wanted to do away with
 special wa y Jews were killing their animals. 
You have no idea how much time was spent on that
 in the Sejm which wa s the Congress, and my 
father knew it from the news co
mi ng year in, and year out.  
Q: Amazing. 

A: Anti-Semitism was just unbelievable.

Q: Paula, I just want to go back
 a little bit. What kind of a 
school did you attend? Wa s this a 
regular public school, a mi xed public school, or not? 
A: We ll, it was considered a regular public school
, but it also was clear that the public school 
was segregated into -- aro -- along 
the line of sex and relig -- relig
ion. So I was attending a girl™s 
school for Jewish girls. 

Q: And so would there be a girl
™s school for Catholic girls? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Huh. We re your friends mi xed in your nei
ghborhood?  We re you with 
Catholics as well as 
Jews, or were you primarily with Jewish kids? 

A: We  lived in a mi xed neighborhood. See, there 
were Jewish neighborhoods, but we lived in a -
- a-and some  Jews not, but the ma jority lived 
in Jewish quarters. But we lived in a mi xed 
neighborhood. So my be st friend wa
s a Catholic girl next door, wh
ich was a Catholic family, a -- 
with five children. And I was th
e only child, so I was there a lot.
 One of the girls was my age, 
Jadwiga, and we were best friends in both home s
. And it was a wonderful friendship. Every year 
I will spend that Christmastime in their home at
 the Christma s tree, and you know, Santa Claus 
comi ng, I was part of it. The only thing I couldn™t 
do was to eat there, because we -- m -- respect 
Kaszrut, y-you know?  So -- 

Q: So you were kosher? 

A: Kosher, yes. So -- mi xed kosher, but still ko
sher enough that I could not eat any non-Jewish 
home . But other than that, you know, I was part of
 their home, and it -- it was wonderful. They 
were wonderful people. He -- Mr. Wojkowski wo
rked on the railroad, and he was sort of a 
chunky guy with big whiskers, you know, like that
, oh. Lovely ma n. And his wife was a chunky 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
18 
 
woma n, she cooked, you know, with big pots and so on. 
So -- I -- I -- I loved 
being there, a-and it 
was great. Two things. In their home , on one wall,
 there was a big portrai
t of the -- o-of -- of 
Mary, and it was the black Mary of Matka Boska 
Czestochowska. Matka Boska, mother of God, 
from Czestochowa. And that was a holy part wher
e some -- this portrait, this mother of Jesus 
saved Czestochowa, stopped in Czestochowa, 
which was a western border city, stopped the 
influx of the Vikings. Her portrait stopped the Vikings. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Imagine? 

Q: Yes. 

A: So in very -- homes that respect that, it wa
s her portrait with a red 
light on top of it that 
burned day and night. And I was so 
scared of that portrait. I reme mber that, cause  there was a 

such a powerful black wo ma n, you know? 

Q: Right. That™s a very big symbol in Poland, isn™t it? 
A: Absolutely. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And it being a Catholic country, you had on 
holidays, eastern and other, you would have 
people ma rching in the street with
 the holy -- holy pictures, and si
nging. It was part of life. The 
bad part for -- of that life for Jews was like that
. Every Easter before the holiday, there came  a 
priest with a bunch of holy water, and he was goi
ng -- it was a four stor
y building, from top of 
the building to the bottom and sprinkle -- sprinkli
ng holy water and saying pray -- prayers. When 
he was comi ng, Jewish people had to stay indoors
. We  could not get out. Okay?  That wa s the 
anti-Semitism from top, right? Also, before Easter
 there was always, every Easter, there was a 
story written up in papers, spoke
n, that the Jews caught a Christian boy, killed him and used his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
19 
 
blood to bake ma tzohs. And that day, Jews were b
eaten up all around the city, just for the sake of 
beating Jews. So that came 
with the holidays as well. 
Q: So how did this affect you as a young Jewish
 girl growing up, since you have -- you were 
living in a mixed neighborhood, your 
best friend is Catholic. Does 
this provoke a kind of conflict 
in you, or this is just the 
way it is? I mean, I ca --  
A: That™s life. 
Q: That™s life. 

A: So at home there were alls --  alwa ys -- the oy veys, and who next, and who will be beaten, 

who will be killed, and be  careful
 on the street, stay home, don™t expose yourself and things like 
that. Between me  and Jadwiga, we had -- we were 
all very curious girls, 
and all through the year, 
we would walk on the street and have 
heavy discussions, mostly about religion. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. So the point of it 
was, whose religion is best? 
Q: That was the point?  And? 
A: The end result. So we w
ould bring up our argume nts. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And my argument, it is the ol
dest religion, look how ma ny year
s, 5,000 plus years, da da da 
da, we gave the Bible, we  got Moses and -- a
nd her was again about Jesus and so on, and so on. 
And then we play on the street, th
at was just part of the routine.
 And then when she or I would 
run out of argume nts, I don™t -- I didn™t know wh
at to say any more to counter, I said wait a 
mi nute, I will be back, and run to my mother. And she did the same  when she ran out. We  would 

run to our mothers and ask how to c
ontinue our discussion, and come  back. 

Q: But this was not an argument. You weren't -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
20 
 
A: We  had -- it was a discussion. 
Q: It™s really a discussion. 

A: It was really a discussion. 

Q: Did anybody win in the end? 

A: I™m sure if she once, I wa -- you know -- 

Q: Both of you si -- but it never 
-- it didn™t affect your relationship? 
A: No. 

Q: No. It™s interesting because often that ki
nd of a conflict you don™t want to have with 
some body, s o you avoid the discussion, but not you folks. 

A: Ha -- we had very smart mothers. 

Q: Yes, I guess you did. 

A: Both of us. 

Q: Right. 
A: That, you know, knew how to 
continue our discussion -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- between us without getting hostile. 

Q: Right. 

A: Cause they could have, if they wanted to -- 

Q: Oh yes. 

A: -- they could -- they coul
d have interfered that way. 
Q: Right. 

A: But no, they just gave enough 
ma terial to keep talking.  
Q: Did you ever want to be
 not Jewish, before -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
21 
 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No, no. And then to -- the only son -- you know, that I think ther
e were five girls and one son, 
Tadek, Tadeusz, was a nice guy. And Christma s time , of
 course, I was there, sitting in the circle, 
and then yo -- Santa Cl aus was comi ng and giving th
ings and so on, and so I was part of it. And 
then one time, I probably was six years old, se
ven ma ybe, Santa Claus is comi ng and does the 
same  thing, and I looked at him and I said, who 
is he?  And I say in the mome nt, ﬁTadek!ﬂ And 
they all broke out laughing, because I -- you know, it was the first time  that I -- 

Q: That you realized. 

A: -- that I realized who Sant
a Claus is. And then later when
 I was thinking about it and 
laughing, I said, well, if anybody shoul
d be Santa Claus, Tadek is fi
ne. I like him, he wa -- 
Q: You like him, he was good. Did th
ey ever take you to church, or
 did you ever take them to 
synagogue or was that also si --  you just didn™t do that, right? 
A: You™re kidding. No. 
Q: I -- I guess I am. You didn™t do that. 

A: It was forbidden. I tell you that
 this was so forbidden and such
 a touchy subject that I didn™t 
know the real -- realize th
at til late -- lately. The idea was th
at I was told -- excuse me  -- was 
when I pass a church, I should run quickly a
nd be gone. Don™t look, just pass it quickly, and 
that™s it. I don™t understood -- 
I -- I don™t think I understood th
at commandment, you know, not 
to be there. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t reme mber why it was la
tely that I understood that.  
Q: You me a n you had forgotten that you were told that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
22 
 
A: No, I remembered it all the time. Cause 
some body I -- you know, cause
 a -- a -- in my life 
here, I was in Catholic church 
or Protestant ch -- nume rous ti
me s, on occ a sion of my friend™s 
different traditions, you know, 
weddings, birth of a child
 or some thing like that. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Funerals. But I -- you know, some body asked me  
so why -- why was it 
such a -- such a -- you 
know, anathema  to avoid the chur
ch?  And I -- I think it 
came  with the realiz
ation how much anti-
Se mitism is connected with Christ ian religion. 
That it, for the 2,000 years since the death of 
Jesus, Jews were accused of killing him, and enc
ouraged by the church to hate Jews and kill 
Jews. And it still goes on, til now.  

Q: But that wasn™t your consciousness as a ki
d. You -- you knew there was 
a problem with being 
Jewish in some  way, certainly on th
ese holidays when you knew you had -- 
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: -- right?  But in general this was not -- this wa
s not an every day feeling of yours, or was it? 
A: If not every da
y, very frequent. 
Q: It was frequent? 

A: Beating Jews was on the agenda. Plus, you know, 
that news that my father was bringing about 
the Congress fighting Jews. Now, the ritual killi
ng of animal s, you know what that is, i-it -- it 
depends on the humanitarian point to kill the animals in -- animal as quickly and p -- as pain fr ee 

as possible, which means that the 
guy that is killing, using the knife
, is looking for a artery in the 
neck of the animal and cuts the biggest artery, 
one or two on both sides. 
So that the death come  
quickest. And the government said no, don™t do that
. It is a Jewish -- Jewish thing. We  kill it 
differently, which is not so humanitarian accordi
ng to Jewish thinking -- Je
wish ritual thinking. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
23 
 
A: So, you know, I heard about -- you know, the -- th
e war against Jews rea
lly, the fight against 
Jews fr om top to bottom. Killing on the street -- 
Q: Mm-hm. Was it typical for most of Poland, or 
was this more in Lódz that -- that the schools 
were segregated by sex and religion
? Was this typical at the time? 
A: That was typical. 

Q: It was typical. 

A: Yes.  

Q: So that you and your friend 
-- and obviously when you™re walk
ing, you™re going to walk to 
separate schools. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And then you come  t ogether later. 

A: Right. 

Q: Did that bother you? 
A: That was it -- 
Q: That was it. 

A: -- that  was life. 

Q: We re you worried, as a young Jewish girl? 

A: No. 

Q: No. You figured you were okay, that this was -- 

A: I was okay, I was protected by my parents -- 

Q: Parents, right. 

A: -- life inside was good, lif
e in school was good for me .  
Q: Would you have considered yourself wealthy? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
24 
 
A: I wouldn™t know what 
you™re talking about -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: -- if you ask me  then. 

Q: You -- you lived in a comfortable place. 

A: Right. 

Q: You were at -- you had good food. 

A: Yes. 

Q: You had clothes, you had a -- a rabbit™s fu
r coat until they got 
you a cloth coat, yes? 
A: Right. 

Q: So you were f -- you were comfor table? 

A: Absolutely, very comfortable. 

Q: When Hi tler took over in Germany 
in ™33, when the Nazis come  in -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- do you -- you hear about it, cause 
you™re father™s a journalist, you know. 
A: The radio was on all the time -- 

Q: It was. 

A: -- with his speeches, w
ith Hitler™s speeches.  
Q: So you™re 11 years old, so you really become  conscious of what™s going on? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. And is Poland then becomi ng more radically
 right at that time as well, so there™s more 
Fascism in Poland at the time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So it become s worse in Poland as well? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
25 
 
A: Right. And there was also bi
g discussion about it, what™s ha
ppening, what should Poland do -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- with the idea, you know, is what is happeni
ng there, and I think the resolution day came for 
is to --  to go to the right and to meet H
itler halfway, sort of be fr iends with Hitler -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to avoid what ma y happen, which they did not avoid anyway. 

Q: Right. Do you reme mber before the war, in ™ 39, that there™s any discussion about we™ve got to 

get out of here, they™re going to 
do some thing?  There is discussion. 
A: And how. A lot of people got out. You had to
 have a lot of money, and you had to consider 
running away from your life. 

Q: Mm. It™s a terrifying thing, isn™t it? 

A: It became terrifying more and 
more as -- after ™33. The relative
s that we had in -- in Germany, 
in the Saar, my father™s mother, my grandmothe
r, and one of the daughters, Erna, who at that 
time was ma rried and had one child, and couple un
cles emigrated to s -- 
to the Saar, Germany. 
That was for -- I think that was in 19 -- 19 --
 ma ybe ™30. That was for economi cal reasons, 
because the depression in Poland was very bitte
r, and Germa ny, [indecipherable] and Germany 
had it better. So for economi c reasons they moved. Now, when Hitler came, the quest ion was -- 

they were under Hitler, we were 
still free. What do they do? What
 does the fa mily do?  So, I think 
even before ™39, part of the fa mily m-moved to 
Palestine, at that time , you know, Israel was not 
existing -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but to Palestine. And my 
father approved of that, you know
, get out of Ger many. Then, you 
know, a year or two passed, or so, and they c
ould not establish themselves. Econ -- economy in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
26 
 
Palestine was horrendous and they could not ma ke 
it. So they went back to Europe, and my 
father was so ma d. They should have stayed, do 
you know what™s comi ng, don™t they see what is 
comi ng?  They went to Fr ance, not to Germany, a
nd lived in France. So that what my father 
thought about, you know, moving -- 
Q: [indecipherab
le] di ffe rent . 
A: -- but for himself and so on, 
there was not the urgency, ther
e was not the money and there 
were Mother™s parents, aged parent s that -- Mother 
was very reluct ant to sit --  to separate hersel f 
from. So there were endless discussion, nothing 
happened. Then we got a -- eventually what 
happened to the family that went eventually to fr
iends was that my aunt was taken from the street 
of Paris to a death camp. My uncle and the th
ree boys, my cousins, with whom we wer e 
corresponding, were lucky enough to escape and st
ay in Switzerland. Because ma ny were turned 
away, Switzerland was -- was not very kind. And 
they were interned in a camp for Jews -- 

Q: In Switzer land? 
A: -- in Switzerland throughout the war. So the pos
itive side was they survived in relative okay 
condition, the negative that they
 were treating -- treat
ed like criminals in Switzerland, in camp. 
So that was this part of the fa mily. Now shortly
 before ™39, people were running away on foot to 
Russia as a way to escape Hitler. Ma ny Jews di
d, and the question was, why don™t we? I was the 
one to instigating into -- w
ho was instigating a run. Don™t you 
see what™s happening?  We cannot 
stay here. Run. My mot her says, if you want to
 run, go. It would be okay with me , but I cannot. 
Here are my grand -- my parents, I cannot leav
e them, so I won™t go. And my father too, there 
was a reluctance to leave on the si
mple premise, that™s my home, 
that™s my country. I don™t want 
to run. Who can force me to run?  And I don™t 
have enough money, and besi
de they were news 
too, that people that invested money in runni
ng, to -- ma king plans to go to South America for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
27 
 
instance, we later fi nd out that  that  was a lie, 
the offices took money a
nd got -- transferred the 
Jews to Gestapo. So there was no firm belief 
that you can really run, because you ma y lose 
everything and your life anyway. So 
that was the decision, to stay.  
Q: Did you think a war was comi ng? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Did you think a war was comi ng? 

A: We  didn™t think, we knew it™s comi ng. 

Q: You knew? 

A: Yes, we knew. 

Q: So when you all s -- when your father said to
 his relatives, why are you leaving Palestine, you 
know what™s happening -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- he -- that™s what he thought? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: And you thought so too? 

A: We  took Hitler™s ﬁMein Kamp fﬂ
 literally. Hitler was st
ill talking on the radio and me -- we I 
mean, my fa ther and my mother and a bunch of othe
r people believed that th
at is his plan and he 
is following it. There was no discussion that 
he will st op, unless friends in England will 
intervene, which they did not, they brou -- broke the pact with Poland. 

Q: Right. 

A: They supposed to stand by Poland and they broke the pact, and they didn™t. 

Q: And did you -- did you also f
eel that there wa s a particular
 vulnerability to the Jewish 
population, to you and your fa mily because of what you heard from Hitler? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
28 
 
A: Absolutely. 
Q: Absolutely. 

A: We  believe in that. 

Q: So there™s no question. 

A: There™s no question. In our mi nd there was no 
question. Particularly th
at -- I think that was 
™38, Hitler led -- Hitler ran out jew -- from Ger m
any, Jews that were not German citizens, that 
were Polish citizens. There were 
a lot of Jews from Poland that 
were in Germany, and they were 
not citizens. He send them back to Poland. And we 
were in touch with those Jews, particularly in 
Lódz, you know, we knew there was a bunch of 
young Jews comi ng, so we got, you know, our 
group got in touch with those guys, and they were
 telling us what™s happening in Germany, and 
about Hitler™s pra -- plans, and to take it se
riously. So for ma ny ways, we knew to take him 
[indecipherable]. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: I don™t know how it was in United Stat
es, but we to -- we knew it™s comi ng. 
Q: Yes. 
A: There was no question. 

Q: Let me  c hange the subject for a mi nute, becau
se I realize I™ve for
gotten about your sister. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Your sister was born in 1926?  
Four years, or si-six years? 
A: No not -- six years.  

Q: Six years. 

A: Right, [indecipherable]  

Q: So she was born in ™20 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
29 
 
A: Eight, eight.  
Q: Eight. 1928. 

A: Mm-hm, yes. 

Q: How was  that for you when this new littler person come s -- 

A: Pretty horrible. 

Q: It was pre -- 

A: I did not -- 

Q: You didn™t approve of that. 

A: I didn™t order her.  

Q: No?  

A: No. She just came. So it was pretty nasty. 

Q: Did your mother try to expl
ain to you what was going to ha
ppen?  Or did she just -- your 
mother got bigger and she arrived. 
A: Yeah, so -- oh, she -- it was talk, she let me  feel her belly. 
Q: Right. 

A: She was -- my mothe r  was pretty open, and -- 

Q: Right. [indecipherable] 

A: -- you know, sort of down to 
earth. And that it™s comi ng, but 
we didn™t know of course, who. 
They wanted -- my mot her wanted a boy, but -- 
probably both parents wanted a boy, they had a 
girl already. 

Q: Right. 

A: But the sister came  and here she wa s, and I 
had to adjust. It was horrible. And I was so ma d 
because later on, you know -- my mother
 di dn™t expect me to raise my sister or do much for her, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
30 
 
really, she never did. I have to say, she was a 
wonderful mot her. My father had chronic TB, you 
know, which was endemi c in -- in -- in Poland. A
nd so he would get attacks, you know, of some  
bleeding from the lungs. And she never expected me
 to serve as a nurse or do things. She was -- 
that was her duty, and so on. A-A
nd about my sister, too, that wa
s her child and so on. But then 
when my sister was walking, going for a walk, sh
e would ask me  some ti mes to take her for a 
walk in the neighborhood. I protested, 
but I took her. My friends love
d her, she was a cute girl. It 
wa s  pr e t t y  hor r i bl e . 
Q: But you were not happy to have this child around? 

A: No, I was not happy.  

Q: What was her name?  Her name was? 

A: Dora -- Dorka, Dorka dimi nutive. 

Q: Did you ever like being around her? 

A: There™s a story. 
Q: There™s a story?  
It™s a long story. 
A: No. 
Q: No. Oka y. 

A: It was so -- a-and then with
 home wo -- I was an excellent stude
nt, my sister was not, so my 
mother asked me  to -- to help her with home work
 and so on, and my sister
 offered me  all kinds 
of deals I couldn™t resist. If you help me  I™ll wash
 the dishes for you, and things like that. It was 
not pleasant, you know, really. Bu
t she was growing up, and then 
we sort of parted ways, you 
know. She had her life and I had my life, til we were sent to Auschwitz. 

Q: So in Auschwitz -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
31 
 
Q: And then it changed. 
A: It changed.  

Q: Why don™t we take a break. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
32 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Paula, we™ll get back to your sister a
nd this change of relationship under these -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- horrendous circumstances. 
But let™s talk about the begi
nning of the war some. The war 
finally -- you -- you™re all expe
cting this to happen. You expect the Germans to cross into 
Poland. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So it™s September, 1939. What do y -- what do
 you reme mber about those first days in the 
war?  What -- what picture is in your head? 

A: We ll, you know, before the war, there were a
ll kinds of rumors comi ng from northern Poland. 
You know, Gdansk -- y-you know the name  of the c
ity, Danzig German, Gdansk, Polish. It was a 
-- a very sore spot between Poland and Germany.
 Poland in s -- Danzig -- Gdansk and Danzig, 
both countries thought it belongs 
to them. Finally, after the firs
t World Wa r, there was this 
agreement that Poland got a little bit of corridor
, because Poland wanted some  access to the se a, 
Baltic Sea. And if -- if Gdansk become  Danz
ig, you know, Poland would have nothing. So they 
agreed to a small corridor that w
ould lead to the Baltic Sea, so 
that both countries had access, 
and that Gdansk, or Danzig -- Poland will have ac
cess to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port. They 
were building another port, Gdynia, but that was la
ter. Okay, so that was sort of a sore spot 
between the two countries, and a sore spot to 
erupt. The news came that Polish troops crossed 

into Germany across this small corridor, and germ
a -- Germany was ready to attack. What turned 
out later that the troops -- Po
lish troops were Germans dressed in Polish uniforms. So they 
provoked that, and they attacked. 
In Lódz what did we do?  We ll, we knew they are comi ng, and 
we developed, you know, sort of on the street, some
 de fense. We will be watching or walking the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
33 
 
streets, particularly the youth, and I was part 
of it, and watching for signs of airplanes comi ng, 
German airplanes at-attacking. So we were 
watching -- you know, walking around the blocks for 
a couple days. And then finally the news came on the radio that the German are on Polish so -- 
soil, and they are comi ng. So what I reme mber 
about that?  I was there -- we were there, my 
grandmother and my mother. I think Father was 
at work, and my mother
 burst out crying. And 
she says, ﬁI won™t ma ke it, not a second time. Li
ved through the first World Wa r, it was horrible, 
I won™t be able to ma ke it.ﬂ And to me  it was, my God, if Mother says that, I am doomed as well, 

I cannot take it, I cannot do anythi
ng like that without my mommy. 
So tha t  was it. So we were 
still ma rching and watching, and watching and re
porting to the elders. Nothing was happening, 
and then all of a sudden we ha -- we heard some
 bombs falling. But Lódz did not suffer from the 
bombing. It was, you know, here and there [inde
cipherable] nothing was 
happening, and one day 
the troops were ma rching in. And the Germans 
were in. And we were still waiting. We were 
ating -- waiting, and pretty soon the Germans star
ted to paste orders on the w -- on the street 
walls, you know, the special walls when you put
 -- what do you call it when you put news? 
Q: Posters? 

A: Posters. About, you know, some  
orders what not to do, times a
nd so on and be home , etcetera, 
etcetera. And was a di -- probabl
y the worst thing then that  happe
ned in those mo me nts was that 
Polish -- Polish neighbors, particularly the -- th
ere was a Polish couple that was taking care of 
the building, you know, sort of admi nistering cl
eaning and so on. And some  others started -- 
began to go to Jewish neighbors and taking out th
ings, furniture, etcetera,
 etcetera. Sort of 
unprovoked, nothing, it was the Pole 
that started the war with the 
Jews. And I reme mb er I was so 
furious about it. We  had a neighbor, anothe
r neighbor who was a mi ddle-aged woma n, a 
businesswoman, she wa s a widow, and she and her 
son were running a little factory, they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500

ma king cardboard boxes. And she spoke perfectly Ge
rman a nd so on, and I talked with her and I 
say, ﬁWhat do we do, Mrs. Kronenburg? ﬂ And then I say, ﬁWell, let™s do some thing.ﬂ And she 
says, ﬁHow about you and me  will go to the Germ
an quarters and report our neighbors, they are 
robbing us?ﬂ I said okay, and Mother said 
okay, she didn™t want to go. And that Mrs. 
Kronenburg spoke German very well. I spoke Ge
rman too because German was second language 
in -- in -- in high school, forei
gn language. So we went to th
e German commando, ve ry innocent, 
you know, and we asked to talk to the chief, and we
 tell him such and such, with disgust, that we 
are being ro-robed -- robbed, and th
at -- is that legal, is that 
how it should be?  And he says no, it 
should not be. So he s -- asks an officer to co
me  with us and stop the rob-robbery from our 
neighbors. And the offi cer came with us and talked
 to the neighbors that were robbing. Then they 
not [indecipherable]. So we  were very proud of that. 

Q: Little did you think what would happen there. 

A: Oh my God, the chutzpah that
 we had, right?  I mean, not -- 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: -- innocent. 

Q: Right. 

A: Then there came the announcement about Jews, pe
rtaining Jews. All Jews 
had to wear a star -
- the stars of davi -- David, and restriction of being on the street, and more and more of that. And 

then pretty soon, as they settle
d in, you know, sort of, in Lódz, 
atrocities started to -- catching 
Jews on the street, taking them to the Gest
apo for beating, interroga
tion. Slugging Jews with 
beards on the street, where mobs wer e  hangi
ng around, and enjoying -- the Polish mobs, and 

enjoying that. That was September, and the anno
uncement of the ghetto, where the ghetto would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
35 
 
be, and that by April everybody will have to be 
there, moved out. School, we did not st art, you 
know, it was September, I supposed to be in high school, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: 12
th
 grade. Did not start, it was closed. 
Q: Wa s that true for non-Jewish kids, for the Gent
ile kids as we ll as for the Jewish kids, there 
just was no school?  Or 
you didn™t -- do you -- 
A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I know it was for Jewish kids. 

Q: Right. And the school were used then as so
rt of office space to ma ke lists of Jewish 
population, we were sitting and ma ki
ng lists of people, this quota, 
this quota, that quota. And of 
places in the ghetto, design ghetto, of the houses, 
house numbers, street numbers etcetera, where 
-- where people were sent. So for good while, 
you know, kids were -- me  among them, were 
busy doing that. 

Q: So they had the kids who would ha
ve been at school 
being s -- pupils -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- doing this -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- logi stical work. 

A: Yes, yes, right. So -- okay, 
so the atmosphere was totally changed. Fear, unex -- unexpected 
can be expected any time, beating, arrest, sendi
ng here, there, we didn™t know what was going 
on. After all, the -- within six days the 
German army occupied the whole Poland. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
36 
 
A: The total country. And as we were joking but 
not so happily about the Polish army that had 
beautiful officers, you know, fa mous for their s
itting on the horses, the officer on the horses in 
corsets and handsome, a nd [indecipherable]. And 
the tanks, the German ca -- tanks, took them 
pretty seriously and didn™t -- all that they want
ed with themself. No defense, no defense. It was 
occupation, and what can I say, i-i-it was -- it 
sort of was unima gabable -- the unimagable was 
happening. A-A state of being nowhere, be
ing nothing, and who knows? And nothing good 
comi ng.  
Q: Oh, that™s for sure, that you knew. 

A: Yes, so, we know that. 

Q: Did you wear the star? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Did you wear the Jewish star? 

A: Sure, yes. 
Q: You did? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And did your little 
sister have to wear? 
A: Sure. 

Q: Yes. So everybody did. 

A: Yes, yes. And then it was some thing like that
, and the fami ly -- Mother™s sist er lived in 
Wa rsaw, and Wa rsaw was still fr ee , and then 
al ready we knew that Wa rsaw will be treated 

differently than Lódz. See, the Germans in-incor
porated Lódz into the Reich, they changed the 

mi  -- ma p, and that became  part of Germany, and 
got the name of Litmannstadt. Warsaw was the 
free territory, it was just occ
upied -- a territory. And we were
 thinking maybe we should go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
37 
 
Warsaw. So the plan was for me  and my -- a c
ousin that lived next 
door, a little older than 
myself, that we will go to Warsaw, and bring some stuff there in preparation for the families to 
go there. We ll, so we we nt, and I didn™t look very Semitic, and neither did she, but we were 

wearing the stars anyway, but we had some  
babushka, you know, around ourselves, and went to 

Warsaw. Uneventful. We ma de it back and forth, 
forth and back. So I saw my -- my a unt there, 
and her son and husband. And they were at limbo ju
st as we were. So I deposited some  stuff that, 

you know, we could use when we come , and -- and 
that was it, I never saw my aunt again, you 

know, and I don™t know what happened to her, but 
she didn™t survive and neither did her husband 
or her son, a little boy at that tim
e. And we came back, a-a-and th
at was that. And pretty soon -- 
soon we were transported into the ghetto. 

Q: Did you think that you and your family s
hould have move d to Wa rsaw, or you didn™t? 
A: I had no opinion, I didn't know what to do. Ni -- nobody knew. 

Q: I see, so -- so all you were doi
ng was transporting 
these things -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- in case some one
 made the decision. 
A: That™s right, in case
 we would go there -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- to have some thing there. 

Q: Le-Let me ask you a small question. What a
bout your friend, your Catholic friend?  The war 

come s, and Jews are clearly segr egated in some
 very significant way, what happens with that 
fa mily and you? 

A: Very soon after the Ge rmans ca me, there were ma ny arrests. He was -- Mr. Wojkowski was 

arrested one of the first, and killed. Why?  He
 was working for years on the railways. Railroads 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
38 
 
were the most important thing -- way of transpor
tation in Poland for the Poles, and was to be for 
the Germans. Though the German ha d airplanes by 
that time, it was different. But that was very 
important for the Germans, to destroy the ra
ilways. So they took all that knowledge -- 
knowledgeable workers, and shot 
them out. And Mr. Wojkowski was 
killed. And then the family 
moved out to some where, they had relative in
 the country, so they move d in the count -- you 
know, to the country. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Since we mentioning that, it was after the war,
 in Lódz, when I was back in Lódz and going 
someplace, that from far away I thought and then 
I knew that I saw one of the sist ers, Wojkowski 
sisters, not Jadwiga. A-And -- and you cannot 
imagine wha t  was going in my mi nd. I did not 
want to approach her, because I thought, what if
 she asks me  the question about my fa mily. And 
I have to tell her I survived and they didn™t. I 
coul dn™t face up to that. So I let it by. That was 
[indecipherable] friends. 
Q: So you never saw them again, I think?
 No?  No. So you were hard on yourself. 
A: Hm?  
Q: You were hard on yourself, weren™t you? 

A: I felt it was all my fault. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: What didn™t I do?  How come s I am here, and 
have nobody to show up that I supposed to save. 
Protecting my sister. So that
 what -- what happened.  
Q: Did you -- did you see brutality bef -- before th
e ghetto, did you see the Nazis on the street, or 

the Poles, taking Jews and b
eating them up, did you see that? 
A: Oh yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
39 
 
Q: You did? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: That mus t  have been extremely difficult.  

A: We  saw those pictures. We
 heard about those pictures 
on radio, what™s happening in 
Germany, so we were not surprised, you know. 

Q: But the brutalization must do something to 
you, especially as a ki
d, when you first see it. 
You™re not -- you™re not used to people being br
utal like that, even if
 you see photographs, right? 
I mean, I don™t know exactly what it does, but it
 must do something, to 
-- cause violence has a -- 
a -- I don™t know, is a -- is a -- a 
level of violation about it that
™s so powerful, it seems to me , 
especially for a young person. 

A: Tell you the truth, I don™t reme mber. 

Q: Mm. 

A: We  knew that was happening. We  saw mostly fr
om the far. I was not exposed close by to the 
brutality like, you know, dragging Je ws by the beard, you know, the -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Orthodox Jews, and beating them. I did 
not see it from close by, I have to say.  
Q: Mm. Let me  ask you another question. Before
 the ghetto was actually formed, the head -- 
what they called the -- the 
elder of the Jews, it was decided upon, and it wa s Rumkowski. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Had you heard about him before the ghett
o, as head of the or
phanage?  Had you heard 
anything? 

A: We  knew he was the head of the orphanage, 
and then he became a me mber of the Jewish 
Committee --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
40 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and then he became the Altest
e of the ghetto, but I didn™t -- 
Q: And that was it. 

A: -- have any close relationship -- 

Q: You didn™t [inde
cipherable] right. 
A: -- of people close by to him.  

Q: Right. Do you reme mber your parents talking about
 why is he being ma de head of a -- head of 
the Jews?  And this is what you -- no. Right.  

A: I am sure there was talk like that . 

Q: Yes. 

A: But it was talk subdued by the feeling 
what™s happening, the 
end of the world. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: We have no power, we -- we --  we are totally dependent now on Hitler and his promise to kill 
us. Tha-That was the essence, he is going to kill us. 
Q: So you believed very early? 

A: Certainl y m- much earlier than Roosevelt did.  

Q: And earlier than when death camps are actually in existenc e? 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Right. So does -- do you have nightmares? 

A: Oh, I used to. 

Q: As a kid? 

A: No, not as a kid. 

Q: Not as a kid, after the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
41 
 
A: After Holocaust. 
Q: After the hol -- after the Holocaust . 

A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah. 

Q: So it doesn™t happen at the time? 

A: No, not now. I -- I think that 
is the best thing that psychotherapy did for me . I was  able to 
sleep again. If nothing else, it did mu ch more. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But that was the biggest 
thing, that I can sleep now. 
Q: You can sleep again. 

A: And sleep well. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not plagued by nightma res. 

Q: During this beginning period, do -- do you reme mb
er feeling scared all the time?  I™m trying to 
figure out ho -- you know, what it™s -- what it™s 
like on a daily basis. Wo uld you feel scared 
when you see a German soldier, or -- 

A: N -- that came much l ater. 

Q: It came later. So not in the beginning. 

A: Not in the beginning.  

Q: How do you find out you™re supposed to go to th
e ghetto?  Is there a po
ster that says Jews 
have to be -- 

A: Oh yes, it was on poster, that at such and 
such date, all Jews have
 to be transported -- 
transport themselves to the ghetto, to -- a-and 
says what streets there were -- you know, w-what 

quarter, that means. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
42 
 
Q: And it was Baluty, right? 
A: Baluty, yes. 

Q: And how do you pronounce that, Baluty? 

A: Baluty. 

Q: Baluty. And that was where you 
went when you were younger, to th
is cell, it was in that area, 
when you went to that Co mmunist discussion. 

A: That™s right, it was in that area, yes. 

Q: It™s the same -- same  section. 

A: Mm-hm. The poorest arna -- area in town. 

Q: Area of -- of -- in the to
wn. And did you know where you were going to go?  H-How was it 
decided where -- 

A: They formed a departme nt of housing. Jews we
re in charge of it, and the Jew -- the housing 
departme nt had lists of the streets of the houses a
nd how ma ny square feet 
were available in each 
apartment or room. And they were assigning peop
le, people working in that departme nt were 
assigning customers that came to the -- to that pl a
ce, square feet, the str
eet number, and the -- the 
house -- you know, the street number, and the place they will live. So it was -- and I worked for 

that departme nt for a few years. And I 
was, you know, giving people places to live. 
Q: So how did you decide?  You™d say four people ha
ve x number of square feet, and so this is 

available, you go here? 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Was there corruption in this pr ocess? 

A: I™m sure. Not among my level. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. But at some  level. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
43 
 
A: Mm-hm. At the highest level. 
Q: Because the conditions in this area are awful, 
in terms of just ordinary
 sanitation. In terms of 
water and toilets and baths and 
-- ther e™s pr actically nothi ng. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Right?  

A: Mm-hm. There was a water pum
p, usually in -- in -- you know, on the plat -- I mean, on the 
yard. 

Q: In the yard, not in the -- 

A: No. 

Q: Not where you were living. 

A: No. Ama z ingly enough for all th
at squalor and density of populat
ion, the sanitation was pretty 
good. The -- the reason -- the number one reason wa
s clear, the Germans we
re very interested 
not to start an epidemic in the ghetto. Because th
ey -- in the center of th
e ghetto, they had their 
offices, the German had their offices, and they did 
not want to be exposed to a th -- epidemic. So 
what they did, you know, they had good sanitati
on department, and the street was smelling -- 
stinking wi th chlor any time  of day or night. Th
ey were pouring chlor, you know, o-on the street, 
on the what do you call. So -- and on
 the toilets, the outside toilets
, chlor, etcetera, and keeping 
thing clean. It was amazing. 

Q: But it stank. 

A: Oh, chlor is better than -- 

Q: Chlor is -- yeah -- yeah, better than whatever
 else it would -- but th
at™s quite amazing because 
the circumstances in that area are -- 

A: Absolutely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
44 
 
Q: -- just  awful. 
A: That was amazing. 

Q: Now, do you reme mb er the day that you move d from your house -- apartment -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- into the ghetto area, 
that you left your things? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did you -- 

A: You had to pick what you will take , and that was not much because it wa s a limited ti -- you 

know, a mount of things that you could take with 
yourself. And then you walk
ed with -- I don™t -- 
some how I -- you know, in my mi nd is that we
 were schlepping it on what you ca -- call? 
Q: A wagon ? 

A: Wa gons. Or was it still s
now, that we could use -- 
Q: A sleigh? 
A: The sleigh?  Maybe. April, so 
it was before -- March, it could 
have well been we schlepped it 
on sleighs and to -- to the -- wh
ere we  were assi gned to go. 
Q: Do you reme mber what you t
ook, since you were -- it™s 1940. 
A: Right. 
Q: So your -- 

A: Personal things? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t reme mber what. But you 
see, one thing was that I took 
my bes t  personal things to 
War s aw. 

Q: And left them there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
45 
 
A: [indecipherable] myself, wh
at did I do, you know, I am her e , and -- and so there was not 
much. 
Q: Not much. 

A: Not much. 

Q: Did you take some thing to write with? 

A: Oh, I am sure I did. 

Q: You mus t  have had some thing -- 

A: Yes, yes, I am sure -- 

Q: -- so that you could do that. 

A: -- yes, that I brought my stuff.  

Q: And did your parents take any furniture? 

A: You couldn™t take furniture. 

Q: Nothing? 
A: No. 
Q: So you™re going into a situati
on where whoever™s left has left their things and you™re going to 
be there with that. 

A: Something. 

Q: Something. 

A: And I think we probably took some  chairs, some  little stools -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- some  little some thing. Nothing big you could take. 

Q: Nothing big. Is your grandmot
her and grandfather also going? 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
46 
 
Q: And are you going -- there™s lot of 
people on the street [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- it was awful. 

A: [indecipherable] you know. 

Q: And are there -- 

A: A procession of the dis
possessed, going to the ghetto. 
Q: And are there people 
watching on the sides? 
A: Poles?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t reme mber, but 
who cared?  You know, it™s -- 
Q: Germans ?  Do you reme mber Germans guarding you in some  way, or not? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: No. 
Q: You™re seeing it, aren™t you? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was a procession.  

Q: Who is holding your sister?  Are 
you holding your sister™s hand? 

A: I don™t re -- probably not, 
I was doing the heavy work. 
Q: You were -- 

A: I was the strongest. 

Q: You were the strong one. And you™re si 
-- 16?  No. No, you™re 19 years old. No, 18. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
47 
 
A: 17, I think, yes. 
Q: 17 - 18, it™s 1940, February 1940, so -- 

A: ™22, yes.  

Q: Wow. I think we have to stop the tape.

Q: Yeah, and then -- and then when you went to the -- 

A: To ghetto. 

Q: To the ghetto. 

A: Let™s see, my street nu -- st
reet name  is a very long one. It™s 28 Pulk Strzeliow Kaniowskich. 
Q: You™re kidding me . Th
at™s extremely long. 
A: I know, crazy. It was after the first war. Y
ou have to understand, Poland was divided and not 
free for a few hundred years. It was the first 
war, and after the war that Poland become  
independent again. So they were honoring their 
troops. [indecipherable], that is 28 Battalion of 
Kanioski shooters 
ri fe -- ri fl emen. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Okay, that probably were famous in the -- one 
battle or another. That
 was -- the street was 
name d in their honor. But it was a hell of a way to tell where you lived. 
Q: Yeah, especially for a young kid. 

A: Right. 

Q: But you moved to -- when you move
d into the ghetto, th-the name  of
 t he street™s really short. 
A: We ll, our street was Zytnia.

Q: Wheat Street. 
A: Zytnia. 

Q: Hm. Had you seen this before you moved in
?  Did you know what it was going to look like? 
A: I don™t think so.  

Q: You don™t think so. 

A: We  were given the address and -- 

Q: And you went. 

A: -- we mo ved. It was empty. 

Q: So how ma ny rooms  did you have? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: How ma ny rooms?  

A: How abo ut one? 

Q: One. 
A: Isn™t that enough for you?  One. 
Q: One small room? 

A: Right. 

Q: For you -- 

A: Four people. My grandmother and grandf
ather had another room on the same  floor. 
Q: On the same  floor? 

A: Right. 

Q: And is there a bathroom on th
at floor?  I knew you were going to
 look at me  like that. There™s

Q: Outhouse. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wa ter?  No, no water. 

A: No water. Pump downstairs. 

Q: But downstairs, so you pump the water to br
ing it -- so h-how do you get food?  What -- what 
do you do for food?  Is there a 
sm -- anything to cook on? 
A: No, we -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- got the ration cards, and so you had a pres
cribed amount of bread for a week per person. 
Then you had stamps to get -- to go to the groc
ery once, whatever, and get supplies for those 
stamps, whi c h were mi nima l. And that™s it. Ve
getables would come  to the ghetto every few 
weeks. In wintertime they were frozen. So 
you ate frozen vegetables, a-and that™s it. 
Q: So there™s very little hot
 meals that you™re getting? 
A: Hot meals? 

Q: Hot meals? 

A: We ll, you cook. You know, my mother was 
cooking, so she was -- you know, the wome n 
were -- that were cooking, the housewives were
 very ingenious in providing some  me als, 
cooking all things possible, like ma king sardines 
out of beet leaves. You didn™t taste that, okay. 
Q: No. 

A: But you roll this, the beet leave -- 

Q: So it looks like a -- 

A: So it looks like a sardine, you sauté it a little
 bit and sprinkle some  salt or -- and it™s good. 
When you™re very hungry, everything is good.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
51 
 
Q: Everything is good. 
A: And we were very hun -- it was unbelie
vable hunger. I reme mber, you know, Mother was 
scolding me  once because  after a year or two I 
look in the mi rror, and I said, ﬁMother, now I 
look as I want to look.ﬂ I was close to being 
a skeleton, you know?  I said, 
ﬁMother, isn™t that 
nice?  I am s o thin.ﬂ And for awhile I really thought so. 

Q: You really thought so, yes. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And she was aggravated with you? 

A: Oh yes. Mm-hm. 

Q: Did she get very thin? 

A: Yes. Everybody. 

Q: Everybody. 

A: People were dying on the street -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- from hunger. 

Q: When -- when you first move in, I understand that Rumkowski and the council began to take 

over certain things, sort of -- 
I don™t know what you want to ca
ll it -- nationalizi
ng it for the 
ghetto and for his -- for hi
s group. So there are schools -- 

A: He established a monarchy. 

Q: Right. 

A: Where he was the ruler, and he has a council to
 help him. He established a school of which he 
was very proud, rightly so. Right?  That was what 
he was doing. So consequently, I was in that 
school for a year, and graduated from high school, 
from that school, right?  So that was in his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500

favor. This school consisted of both the per -- t
eaching personnel and students, of remnants of 
people that were in the ghetto. 
Remnants because a lot of people from ea ch school we re mi ssing. 
Either they were killed off alr
eady, or they were able to run 
off to Russia, for instance. You 
know, a good number of people survived living in Russia. 
Q: Right. 

A: So there were sort of remnan
ts of different student in differe
nt schools, so that was the new 
school. And the same  went for teachers. And the 
director of the school wa s a very acknowledged 
woma n, Mrs. Rhein, R-h-e-i-n, who was a director of
 one of the high school
s, girl™s high schools, 
private high schools in Lódz city. And she, you 
know, directed that school. So consequently, you 
know, I graduated from high school. And it serves
 me  -- served me  right later. It was 
acknowledged by the university 
in Germany, this high school. A
lthough he developed different, 
what we called, resorts. Resorts were really 
a industrial complex, not 
a resort like, you know, 
you go to for a rest. 
Q: Right. 
A: So they had th -- see, I have very mi xed f
eelings about Rumkowski, okay?  For once, I hate 
him, for once I hate the whole Jewish kingdom t h
at he built, which is no question about it. On 
the other hand, he did something positive. What he 
did was to bargain with the Germans for life, 
through the -- through the w
hole period of ghetto™s existence. So he told the German a nd they 
liked to hear that, that we  w
ill supply you with workers, and we will gi -- you first -- give you 
first class industries that you can 
use for yourself. For the price th
at you -- that I ca -- can keep 
this place alive, I can have  living people worki
ng for you here. And that™s how it worked out. So 
at different resort, there was 
ro -- a resort, the industry of 
-- oh, I don™t know. I -- where I was 
working in Capol, the first one was we were ma
 -- a tailor industrial per -- complex, making -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
53 
 
ma king uniforms and pa rticularly coats for the Ge
rman ar my. And that consi -- what we were 
working at is -- it was called the Gummi Fabr
ik. You recall probably the coats that Ge rman 
soldier -- they were stiff like 
a board, right? Broad shoulders, sti
ff and big things here. What we 
were do -- the tailors were cut
ting them, you know, cutting out the 
part. We -- we were using a 
glue -- special glue to glue t
hose parts together, you know, because they were double, sort of 
double. 
Q: So they weren™t sewn, they were glued. 

A: They were glued, yes. So -- for stiffness, 
and for wearability and so on, we were doing that. 
After we graduated, and graduated with -- with bi
g pomp and parade. Of course, it -- the par -- 
the pomp was for Rumk owski, that he did it. 
We were given -- we we
re given work, you know, 
then we had to work. Otherwise we had no way of 
being in the ghetto. People that -- that worked 
could be in the ghetto. Whoever didn™t work was 
sent out to another ca
mp, meaning Auschwitz, 
but we didn't know about that then. So we were 
given work. So the first place that he send us 
girls -- the girls, graduating girl
s, was to this factory of the Gummi coats, which was such a 
horrendous place. 
Q: Why?  

A: It was run by ma n tailors of the lowest degr
ee. And for them to get a group of intellectual 
girls, God, how they treated us. Wa s terrible. 

Q: What™d they do? 

A: Call us name s, pinch us, I don™t know what else 
he -- they did with some  other girls, not with 
me , but the atmosphere was just full of pe
rversion, laughter at us. It was horrible. 
Q: Hm. When do you -- when do you graduate?  I™m 
just trying to get a time  fra me here. You 
hadn™t started high school 
when the war started. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
54 
 
A: 1940 we gr -- I graduated. 
Q: In ™40?  

A: I think it was in ™40. 

Q: So the same  year -- 

A: It was the year after -- 

Q: -- the same year as the ghetto starts? 

A: No, that™s impossible. I don™t remember
 the year. Probably couple years later. 
Q: So high -- is high school -- high school is not like American hi
gh school, it™s not four years, 
it™s less, right?  Because you -- 

A: It™s 12 years, still the same . 

Q: Right, but the high school actually 
starts later, am I right? Or -- 
A: No. 

Q: No?  
A: High school is four years, high school. 
Q: It is four years? 

A: Yes. 

Q: But you go -- you actually graduated in less ti
me  in the ghetto, am I right?  You didn™t go for 
four years?  

A: No, but I was in the junior high school
, I™ve -- I finished ju
nior high school -- 
Q: Uh-huh. So it was the last two years. 

A: -- and was to star t -- yes, 
was to start high school -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- senior high school in the ghetto. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500

Q: When you™re going to get work after you gr
aduate, do you know the person who is head of 
the labor bureau, Bert Fuchs?  Bert F-u-c-h. There™s a Fuchs -- 
A: In the ghetto? 

Q: Yeah. Jewish. 

A: It does not ring the bell. 

Q: Doesn™t ring a bell. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Okay. 

A: He was the director of what? 

Q: The labor bureau. 

A: The labor bureau. 

Q: At a certain point there are two or three 
people, but at the begi
nning, he™s the only one. 
A: Mm-hm. No, I don™t reme mber. 
Q: You don™t reme mber, okay. Cause I thought ma ybe you had crossed paths or some thing. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So how did -- how long do you stay in th
at first job, a few months, few weeks? 

A: Probably months. I don™t know exactly.  

Q: How is it for your parents?  Is your father a 
-- are your father and mother working right away, 
or you -- only your father? 

A: My father was working. He became  -- he got a 
job of being a -- ad -- ad
mi nistrator of a -- of a 
part of the ghetto, it™s a couple streets. They we
re assigned different admi
nistrator to look after 
the needs of the -- of 
the street, the needs of the building, etcetera. So he was doing that. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
56 
 
A: Mother was not working. 
Q: So would he be -- have been considered part 
of -- not the Jewish Council 
itself, but part of the 
admi nistration of the ghetto in some  -- 

A: Mm-hm, yeah. 

Q: -- in some  way. Wa s -- did this mean you got more food? 

A: No. 

Q: No. Meant nothing. 

A: Meant nothing. Meant nothing, that he was work
ing, otherwise he would be sent out from the 
ghetto. 

Q: Right. 

A: And it meant that he got some  -- the mone
y was insignificant. Bu
t got some  rations, you 
know, ma ybe a little more of rations cards
, though I don™t think so, it meant nothing. 
Q: Right. 
A: He was just privilege by being able to work. 
Q: Right. Now, from my readi
ng, I understand that in 1940 and ™41, 
there were a lot of worker 
demonstrations against Rumkowski and the -- an
d the Jewish Council, th
at the rations were 
insuffi cient, the work wasn™t suffi cient, and th
at Rumkowski sent the Ge
rmans in, and got these 
people depor -- 

A: I don™t recall that. 

Q: You don™t recall that? 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t see any demon --  

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
57 
 
Q: May -- ma ybe it was in another part of the ghetto. 
A: It mi ght have been, but I was -- 

Q: Uh-huh, but you didn™t -- 

A: -- it didn™t come  -- 

Q: -- you weren't aware of that. 

A: -- close to me. 

Q: Right. So how did you get out of this first jo
b? Did it just stop, or did you ask for another 
position? 

A: –I am s ort of wrestling with my self. I 
would like to share some thing with you, not about 

myself, and not myself, but I would 
not like it to get in the record. Is
 that possible, or I shut up? 
Q: Well, we -- you can tell me at another time. 

A: Good. But anyway, he was organizi
ng the police, okay, Jewish police. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: You heard about that. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And he also decided to have a troop of 
wome n police -- policewomen, okay?  And he took the 
-- hi-his beloved high school graduates and sent
 them to the fema le police force, okay? 

Q: He really liked th
is group of girls, huh? 
A: Hm?  

Q: He liked this group of -- 

A: It was his pride -- 

Q: Oh, his pride, uh-huh. 

A: -- he did some thing for the future. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
58 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You know. And he was a social worker at heart,
 y -- it™s -- it™s a very 
mi xed bag in that ma n. 
Q: Right. 

A: So he -- a-and that what happened to me . Fe
w of the girls from the -- from the -- this -- you 
know, tailor resort, went into the 
police. And we as police wome n were given the task to be on 
the street, and keep the street -- 
keep the street traffic in orde
r. So we got uniforms, you know, 
and a office. 

Q: What kind of unifor m? 

A: Green jackets with buttons. 

Q: Really? 

A: And green pants, yes. 

Q: Hat? 

A: Hat. And then we were in the office. I and an
other girl were ma de to be officers, you know, in 
charge of the troops, and above us was a elderl
y Czech Jew, who ca me  from Prague. You know 
one thing is that to the ghetto, 
Lódz ghetto, there were 
sent Jews from all over Europe to be there 
and dispose with them, you know, everyplace else
. So there was -- was a wonderful group of 

Czech Jews that came  to the ghetto, okay?  Mos
tly young students graduate, and it was such a 
refreshing -- I worked then at
 the housing departme nt, so I 
met with them, you know, a lot, 
because they came for housing. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they were so refreshing. I mean, innocen
t. They didn™t know they are Jews, or nude. You 
know, it was very -- a mi xed culture, Jews and Ge
ntiles. So one of the Prague guys was this 

elderly, handsome  guy, you know, old -- pretty old, a
nd he was in charge of [indecipherable] the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
59 
 
women -- just -- it was comedy -- with anothe
r woman, a Czech woman, I think she was his 
assist ant. So we™re sitting in the offi ce and te
lling stories from Czec
h -- P-Prague, etcetera, 
etcetera. So that la-lasted for 
awhile, and that was disband, too. 
Okay, it was not such a innocent 
group in such a innocent job. Now, that I am talk
ing freely because it™s ab
out myself, not about a 
friend. So i-it -- other than keeping the traffic 
going -- not traffic, you know what traffic, there 
were no car -- 
Q: It™s walking traffic. 

A: -- walking traffi c. 

Q: Yeah, yes. 

A: A-And there was other traffic. There 
was a lot of sewage people working, you know, 
sanitation, because the toilets had to be -- the outsi
de toilets ha d to be cleaned regularly because 
of fear of epidemic, so that traffic was going. 
What else?  And the -- the 
traffic to the cemetery, 
that was a lot, you know, a lot of people were 
dying. You know, picked up from the street or 
otherwise. Ot her than that, we were given a or
der there should not be 
any trade on the street. 
Now what kind of trade do you think there was? 
What there was is th
at people were ma king 
candies out of the sugar rations. People were 
ma king candies with a ta
ste, and wrapped them, 
and then they were selling it on th
e street. And their order was that 
that trade should not exist. So 
we were supposed to watch for that, and if we -- when we catch a guy that is selling this candy, 

we were supposed to bring them to the real polic
e, the me n police. So that™s what we were doing, 
we were supposed to do. Now, if the real poli
ce catch a guy like that, you know where he was 
going. 

Q: They™d get deported. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
60 
 
Q: Right. 
A: So it was one -- one day, I and a friend of mi ne  from the school, my previous school, she was 

per -- patrolling the street and she said -- I was 
a officer, you see, I was not patrolling. So she 
says, ﬁPaula, you have to come  with me . I want
 you to come  with me  and I want to show you 
what we are doing, our job.ﬂ So, fine, you know, so we
 walked the street, and then we come  to a 
guy that was selling candi es, and she says, ﬁWell th
at what I have to do, and I will do you what -- 
I am arresting him and bringing the -- to the po
lice.ﬂ Which she did, and we went to the police, 
and she depart. And she says, ﬁDo you know what 
will happen to the ma n? ﬂ And she says, ﬁDo 
you know what we are doing here?ﬂ We spent all 
night walking and talki
ng. And could not get a 
peace of mi nd. So I say, that™s it, no more, I am leaving. 

Q: And did she do the same  thing? 

A: The lucky thing was that th
e pol -- wome n police was disbanded in a week from tha t  
occurrence, so we didn™t have to 
do anything. We  were told, no more. 
Q: Was that because the 
two of you said you didn™t want to do it, or -- 
A: No, no, independently. 

Q: Independently. 

A: Rumkowski did away with it,
 for whatever reason I don™t know. 
Q: And for how long was this go
ing on, a few months, a few week? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Not -- but not for very long. 

A: Not for very long, few months.  

Q: And were you -- the office that you were in, 
were the -- was the ma le police -- Jewish police 
there also, or were you totally se
parate from the Jewish police? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
61 
 
A: Separate. 
Q: You were separate? 

A: We  were separate. 

Q: And was that your first confrontation with wh
at that job wa s doing?  When you went out with 
this woma n -- 

A: Yes. That was. 

Q: -- you really didn™t -- you didn™
t think about it, or know what 
he said to [indecipherable] 
A: That™s right, th
at ™s right, mm-hm. 
Q: Not so easy, huh? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Not easy. 

A: Oh, horrible. But that what it was. The 
police was helping Rumkow
ski keeping order -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and keeping the deal with the Germans. 
Q: And did you have opinions then about the ma le Jewish police? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You want to tell me? 

A: The ma le  Jewish police wasn -- no question 
about that they were fully cooperated with 
Rumkowski and therefore with the German
s, and we had no good opinion about them. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you afraid of them? 

A: No. 

Q: No.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
62 
 
A: And they were very helpful at the time of 
getting Jews into the transport going to Auschwitz. 
I tell you, it was horrible, the thought that Jewish 
police is helping Germa ns. It was horrible. I 
changed my mi nd a bit watching Lanzma nn™s mo
vie. You know, when he interviews the 
Sonderkomma ndo in Auschwitz, and you saw people that we re really on the other side, in 
Auschwitz, helping Germans to kill Jews, fr ankly to kill Jews. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I got away with a different feeling. How 
can you blame people that were forced to do the 
job, knowing they are going to be killed 
in four months, how can you blame the m? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was very powerful. 

Q: On the other hand -- let me  give you the other hand here. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: You couldn™t do it. You couldn't do some thing th
at was in a way simpler, but was part of a 
process. 

A: No, I couldn™t do it. 

Q: And it was some thing that you couldn™t do. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: So -- 

A: And I™m sure other people couldn™t either. 

Q: Right. So some  could, and ma ybe they could li
ve with themselves and ma ybe they couldn™t, 
but they did it anyway.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
63 
 
A: That™s right. That -- you
™re right. And in Auschwitz, you know, the Sonderkommando that 
did work, you know, the gas chambers and the cremat
oria, some  were just picked and forced to 
do it.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They had no way out other than go --  

Q: And be killed. Right. 

A: -- right away. 

Q: Right. You ever think what wouldhave happened if everybody said no? 

A: There would be a revolution, and ma ybe successful. 

Q: It™s hard to do that though, isn™t it? 

A: That™s why the big problem was, you know, 
is -- Hannah -- what was her name, Hannah -- 
Q: Hannah Arendt. 

A: Arendt, accusing Jews in Poland that th
ey went  like sheep to the gas chambers. 
Q: Actually, she didn™t. 
A: No?  

Q: No. 

A: Who did?  Where did that come from? 

Q: I don™t know. Some times the resistance said that. 

A: Hm?  

Q: Some times the resist ance, the partisans -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- said don™t go like sheep. 

A: Oh, I see, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
64 
 
Q: She never s -- 
A: But she didn™t. 

Q: She didn™t say it. 

A: I see, okay, so -- 

Q: But it™s a -- 

A: Excuse me .  

Q: No, but it™s a -- it™s an accusation that 
people think she said things like that -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- she didn™t. She -- she was not happy with the 
councils, but she never blamed the rest of the 
Jews. She thought that the councils shouldn™t have c
ooperated. That, yes, but she never said that 
other. 

A: And this gave me  also another thought, 
you know, when I was in August in Lódz -- 
Q: Oop, w-we have to stop?  Okay, we™ll stop. Sorry. 
A: Finish later. 
Q: Yes, we™ll finish it later. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
65 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Okay. We forgot something. When you were 
talking about being in high school, weren™t you 
at some  point in some thing called a farm settleme
nt that we didn™t talk
 about?  What was that?  
Was that while you were in high school?  Wa s that part of the high school? 
A: That was part of Rumkowski™s plan. As you know
, he was a social worker and director of an 
orphanage before the war. He also wa s a great 
Zionist. And at the -- at the time when the school 
opened, he gave us a proposition that whoever woul
d volunteer can go to this
 place that was part 
of the ghetto, but it was sort of more rural, and 
it was a old house that used to be a orphanage. 
Not his orphanage, but the Polish population. A
nd that we would, boys and girls go there and 
learn farming in preparation for the -- to go into
 Pa lestine and become  kibbutznik farmers. So, 
you know, we needed to have the permission of our 
parents, and then a group of us went there. 
And we spent a full year there. And it was a 
wonderful time, a time that permit us who were 
willing to be there, to forget where we  were. It 
was out of this world, really. It was a huge house, 
a orphanage, you know, so there was big halls. 
And our group was probably not more than 20 
boys and girls. Boys separate, girls separate be
drooms, etcetera. And in the morning we would 

go to school. We  would go by -- by 
carriages, you know, we had some  pe ople that were bringing 
u -- by horse and buggy, big buggy, to school, and then afternoon we would come  to the farm. 

We call it Hak™shara, which is Hebrew for 
far m. And it has the Zionist implication, but we 
couldn™t give a damn about -- at that time about th
e implication of Palestine, it was just a lovely 
place. It was a farm that used to be used -- you know, it was used by Poles as a farm, and also 

had animals. It had goats, and chickens, etcete
ra. And there was one guy, he was a German Jew 
who was a farmer, and knew about, you know, fa
rming, and other than going to school, 

homework, etcetera, he would teach
 us what to do. In other word, we would sow seeds, and all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
66 
 
kinds of thing, and take care of the growi
ng crop. There was a orchard, and there were the 
animals. The animals we would -- let™s see, ther
e were some  cows, and there were some  goats, 
and we would learn how to milk them. And then
 distru -- distribute the mi lk by buggies, and -- 
horse and buggies to cooperative, to stores, 
you know, run by the -- by Rumkowski that will be 
selling it to the population on car
ts and so on. So it was a idea
l love -- life, really. Very 
gratifying. Of course, we paired up, boys and girl
s, and so were some  roma nces going and that 
was, under the circumstances, unheard of. We  -- of
 course, were properly
 chaperoned by mothers 
that would take turn and come  for overnight to 
be with -- with the -- you 
know, with us, to ma ke 
sure nothing was happening. So that was the -- 
Q: Did they really stop 
things from happening? 
A: I think, in a way, yes. So that was the time , 
and it was a lot of ca mara
derie, and there™s sa -- 
were some  evening that we had music, some  of
 the people play [indecipherable] particularly 
played the piano, and there was a piano. So we 
had music, and we were dancing. You know, so 
we were cooking [indecipherable] for the crew, 
you know. So we would take turns for 24 hours 
to prepare meals, a boy and a girl, cou -- you 
know, prepare breakfast
, lunch, dinner, and 
etcetera. So it was a unbelievable year. 

Q: So you were staying there as opposed to 
being with your parent
s and your sister. 
A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: Right. Did you have a boyfriend? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wa s this a boyfriend from before, or
 some body that you me t in this group? 
A: Some body who I me t in this group. 

Q: In group? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
67 
 
A: Yes, mm-hm.  
Q: And how ma ny boys and girls were there, do you think? 

A: Altogether close to 20. 18 - 20. 

Q: Did you mother ever -- was she ever -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- chaperone? 

A: Yes, yes, she agreed to. 

Q: They never took the fathers fo
r a chaperone, only the mothers. 
A: Yes, cause [indecipherable]why, why, why -- I don™t know why. 

Q: And was this er -- wi -- like in ™42 -- 1942, 
do you think?  Do you have any recollection what 
year?  I me a n, I know it™s hard to figure
 out what years these things are. 
A: ™42 - ™43. Some thing like that. 

Q: I was just trying to figure it out in 
relationship to the work
 that you were doing. 
A: It was before. 

Q: It was before -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- right, because you we
re still in high school. 
A: That™s right [indecipherable] 
said before high school. And the
n, when we graduate from high 
school, what happened?  O-Of course, the farm 
disbanded, why did it disband?  Ti me s got tougher 
politically. I think Rumk owski did not have a
ny more ji -- way of thinking and doing to 
supervise or insist, or we simp
ly -- that what happened, it was di
sband and we were given jobs. 
Q: So you --  

A: We were needed to work. We had to stop and 
we are needed to -- to work for the Germans.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
68 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You know we -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we -- we were needed to pay off.  

Q: So this is that same  class, that last gra
duating class in the high school that you talked about 
before, yes? 

A: Right, yes. There was another class 
after us, so two cl
asses graduated.  
Q: But they didn™t have this opportunity. 

A:  They™re -- t h e -- 

Q: The farm. 

A: They didn™t come  to the farm. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t reme mber why, or th
e times already toughened and, 
you know, there was no -- no time  
for fr ivolities, so to speak. 

Q: Right. 

A: So we were the only group that did it, th
at had this privilege, really. Oh f --  
Q: And did you -- 

A: -- yes? 

Q: I™m sorry. Did you then go back to 
live with your parents and sister? 

A: Actually, I never went  back to live with my
 parent again. I was emancipated. Oh, there was 
another job immediately after, 
that was -- so many jobs in 
such a short time, so it -- 
Q: That™s okay. 

A: -- sort of get mi xed up. Hm?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
69 
 
Q: It™s okay if it gets mi xed up. 
A: Yes. One job was ma king, you know, in -- in
 a production of houses, what you call houses 
that you build part 
-- parts for it. 
Q: Prefabricated?  

A: Prefabr -- prefabricated home
s for export to Germany, okay?  So some  of us went to work on 
that, and we got housing there, al
so outside, you know, the main part of the ghetto. And we -- we 
were living there totally, and working. So that 
was -- lasted for awhile, and that was finished. 
Now, we we re doing the -- the prevat -- prefabri
cated parts with cement, mi xing ce ment, pouring 
it into forms , taking out -- you know, we lear
ned the whole production 
of how do you do -- how 
you do it. And that ended. But another job that I 
had was working in a kitchen, and that was the 
best job. An-And really ended badly. There was a 
occasion to go to work for a kitchen that was 
established -- kitchen restaurant, so to sp
eak, establish by Rumkowski that was producing 
dinners one -- once a day dinners 
for people that work in differe
nt kind of industries and were 
given a bonus to come  to this -- to this kitchen 
for a dinner, for a week or two weeks or so. It was 
a extra sort of a pay-off for good work and so on. 
And working in that kitchen, of course it was 
wonderful, because you could eat, okay?  You didn
™t have to be  hungry, right?  So -- and it was 

nice, there was a nice by -- bunch of girls, familia
r also from the school, and it was nice to work 
there. We  made hamburgers, we do this, we chop
ped up all kind that was needed in the kitchen, 
under the supervise -- supe
rvision of wome n cooks. And then what happened was that there was 
a Sonderkommando older guy, you know, that I and he
 knew each other, I don™t remember from 
where, but there were no hard feelings bet --
 between us, there was some  hostility. I don™t know 
what -- what was the cause, but at any rate, he
 was on duty one day, and I went -- supposedly I 
was asking the cook that was serving the soup -- I was serving -- you know, the guy that -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
70 
 
Czech that was supervising the wome n police, a
nd he was there e -- as a client , and I suppose 
that he asked the server to give me a little mo
re in the plate of soup, because I wanted to, you 
know. And this Kohn, Kohn was his name , caught me
 doing that, and therefore did saw that I 
was kicked out from the  kitchen, from my
 good j ob. Hi ms elf was a -- a s-son of a gun, you 
know, terribl e guy to get to be accused of anything. 
And -- an-and -- and that was it, so that job 
ended, and I was sent, as a punishme nt, I was sent 
to a -- to a resort, a 
-- a factory that was 
ma king stuff out of wood. That means they 
were ma king wooden chairs, wooden wagons, you 
know, wheels, wooden wheels. It was a huge f
actory, under one roof, you know, just huge, full 

of machineries that produced a 
lot of dust when you worked them. 
So that was my punishment. I 
was sent to Siberia, and I was there for about a y
ear or so. It was a tough 
year, really. Hard work, 
a lot of dust, and I was puni
shed, you know, that was punish
me nt. So what can I say. 
Q: And you were agai -- still living away fr
om your parents. You -- you had found your own 
place?  
A: No. At this time I think I went back -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- home, cause there was no pl
ace to -- to be. So -- but I 
found a very nice friend there, 
working around the young people and we chumme d t
ogether. And so from the social point of 
view, it was nice. 

Q: Right. 

A: Except that it was a dirty job. 

Q: Right. Now, is this after you were in the women™s police force?  Do you -- 

A: I think it was before, probably. 

Q: You think it was before? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
71 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Mm-hm. So -- a-and you know, my encounter with
 this Sonderpoliceman 
was as we were the 
last day in the ghetto, as we were transporte
d to Auschwitz, you know, before -- before being 
[indecipherable] to the -- you know, to the wagons
, y-you know, that take us. And there was I 
and this policeman, and I looked at him and I 
didn™t say a word, just thinking, you scoundrel. 
Here you are and here I am. 

Q: Right. Here you go. 

A: Common ending -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- of the story. So that was part of my life. 

Q: What™s happening to you as a young woma n?  You™re 20 -- in 1942, two 
years after the -- the 

ghetto was formed, you™ re 20 -- 20 years old. 
A: Yes, 19 - 20, yes. 
Q: 19 - 20 years old. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: What kind of a person are you becomi ng?  Ar
e you -- you clearly -- as
 you tell the story, you 
clearly have mome nts when things
 are not so terrible.
 You™re meeting friends, you have friends, 
there™s some thing -- thing -- there are things
 that ma ke you happy. Bu
t clearly, there™s an 
underlying some thing that must be very 
wearing on you. Are you depressed, are you -- 
A: I think the motto for that be
ing then is we shall overcome. 

Q: You really felt that. 

A: Oh yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
72 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: Yes. And in the family too, you know. We  di
dn™t know the song we sha
ll -- you know, that -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- that black people brought and le
d the -- the Civil Rights Moveme nt. 
Q: Right. 

A: But that was what kept us 
going. We shall overcome . And the 
motto was life, keep on living. 
Q: So you didn™t give up? 

A: Oh, no. 

Q: In spite of everything that you knew. 

A: Right. And neither would my mother or 
father, or within the close- knit family. 
Q: They didn™t give up either. 

A: No. We  s hall overcome. And, you 
know, listening to the ri -- radio -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- and of course we had to give up when 
the German ca me, first among their rules was all 
radios you br ing to this pl ace in Lódz, and sewi
ng machines and all machinery, guns of course, 
you know, etcet -- etcetera. So if you were caught
 listening to -- to the radio, you could be 
deported. 
Q: Right. 

A: But I want -- I wanted to say you 
can get killed, but deported was -- 
Q: The same . 

A: -- equals death. 

Q: The same  thing, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
73 
 
A: So -- so no radio, no listening to the radi
o. So we didn™t know, but
 somehow some rumors 
were crossing, some  people were listening to 
the radio. You know, they dared and they were 
listening to it. And I think my father had some connection with some body that got the news. So 
we knew broadly what was ha
ppening, and we knew where the Germans were, you know, the 
trip to Siberia, and Stalingrad. 
And also what we knew that at 
that time he had all Europe under 
his hand, right?  And -- and fighting England an
d bombing London, and so on. So we knew what 
was th -- and some  of the news were brought 
by people that were deported from Paris and 
Vienna, and yi -- all your Holland, Dutch people,
 Czech -- Czech people, they were bringing 
news because they still knew what was going on, cl
oser than we did. So we knew that he has by 
now all Europe under -- under his foot, and that th
ere™s little hope reall
y, of very -- very m -- 
very changes that could happen in immediate future
. So you just had to take a -- a long view to 
the future, we  shall overcome, in spite of ever
ything that is happening. So
 you have to be strong. 
And one thing that became  very
 i mportant in every day life was how you live with almost 
nothing. That the ration that you got fr om the bake
ry, that piece of bread that you got per person, 

and you are in charge of it, it has to last you a
ll week. Don™t eat it in one setting. Because people 
that did, died. People that didn™t
 lost weight, and died too, so
me  that could not go on and got 
some  infection and so on. So how do you do that? 
Fa milies that could do that, and my mother 
was the leader of it, we did it under her supe
rvision. We  stemme d the 
hunger and take very -- 
took very little, could survive and hope for late
r. Many people could not, and died just because 
they could not do it. 

Q: Did you smoke?  

A: No. 

Q: Did a lot of people smoke then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
74 
 
A: I take it back. 
Q: You take it back, you did smoke? 

A: My first experime nt with smoking was when I wa
s in the police fers -- force, and this guy, the 
Czech guy and his assistant were smoking, and I say, 
hey, let me  try it. So I tried, and I got sick. 
Dizzy, and so on, and I gave it up. But I smoked late
r, for a few years, you know, after the war. 
Q: After the war. 

A: Yes. 

Q: The reason I ask is because ma ny people smoke
d because it™s -- I don™t know if it stops 

hunger, but you don™t seem to be -- necessarily 
eat as much if you™re smoking. So I thought 
possibly that was -- 

A: I didn™t get to that st age. 

Q: You didn™t get to that stage.
 So you -- you and your fa mily were very disciplined about the 
rationing of food. 
A: Oh yes, yes.  
Q: Your sister is much younger, was it more di
fficult for her because she was so muc h younger?  
Or was she old enough to understand by -- 

A: I -- she was old enough -- 

Q: -- she must have been, she was a teenager. 

A: -- and she was a smart little gi -girl. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
75 
 
Q: Right. Let me  ask you some thing about Ru
mkowski. I interviewed someone, Lucille 
Eichengreen, who both -- she wrote about and --
 a-about her own experi
ences, and experiences 
of other people with Rumkowski. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: That he was abusing young women, some ti mes 
boys. It ha ppened in the orphanage , according 
to her, and it -- then it 
happened in [indecipherable] 

A: You me a n before the war? 

Q: Before the war. 

A: Mm-hm. Pedophile. 

Q: And in the ghetto, as well. And I wondered 
if you heard anything or knew anything about 
Rumkowski and what he did. Becau
se we don™t -- we can™t -- she™s the only person who has been 
willing to talk about it, and she only talked 
about it once everybody she knew was dead, so she 
wouldn™t hurt -- 
A: Mm-hm. I see. I knew that -- but not direct
ly -- and I never had any interview with him, 
though people would go asking for special things, a
nd would have a need to talk with him. I 
never had the need, I never met him personally. Bu
t I heard that he wa -- you know, that if you 
want a audience with him, you have to be prepar
ed that he will sexually assault you. So I heard -- 
that was floating rumors all over, and to be be
lieved. Now, I know about his life some thing else. 
He got ma rried in -- in the ghetto, you know, and 
his wife lived in the house -- same  house that 
we lived. And he was -- she was a lawyer, so-c
alled a old ma id, you know?  
I don™t know if she 
was 30 or 31 or 29, but she was all -- already ol
d. You know, according. And 
he married her, so I 
saw him come , you know, to the house, walking into
 the house and that -- few times, and that™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
76 
 
it. Then when they were ma rried, I suppose she 
lived with him not -- not in that house where I 
lived. So why he got ma rried, I 
don™t know, but who™s to say? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So, I think -- a-as you know, he
 was the last transport, both
 of them went to Auschwitz. 
Q: Right. 

A: And did not survive. 

Q: Right. Of course, there are different rumors a
bout that, he was killed by people who had been 
in Lódz, or he was gassed, who knows? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Nobod -- nobody is sure. 

A: No, I don™t know -- 

Q: Right.  

A: -- anything beyond that. 
Q: Do you reme mber the speech he gave in Sept
ember of 1942, give me  your children, were you 
there? What was that like? 
A: The worst day in the world. He gathered a lot 
of people, cause it was known that he will gi ve 
the speech, so people came . And we knew that
 it cannot be any good news, so you know, that 
was in the air. And he gave a speech. Hewas a good speaker, you know, telling how much he 

cares,telling how much work he
 puts in -- into survival, and do the best for the population, and 
we should believe him and trust him.  And in that vei
n, he wants to tell us that it is up to us to 
prevent any big loss of populati
on, the Germans gave him a number of children between the ages 
-- I don™t reme mber, young children, but not 
too young, you know, the -- they -- the Germans 
will bring those children to a sp
ecial care -- camp, that they will 
get a very good care, better than 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
77 
 
in the ghetto, that he can assure 
us will happen, and that will allow th
e ghetto to survive til war is 
ended. So please, mothers, go home, prepar
e the children. Give them, you know, prepare 
some thing, clothing, some dishes 
to eat from. And it was not the 
dep -- you know, the collection, 
such and such day. That was it. And there was, 
of course, a lot of cryi
ng and screaming, and the 
people dispersed. It was paraly
zing, you know, paralyzing fear and 
anger. But what bothers -- 
bothered me worst, as we ma -- were making 
our way home , I don™t know if wha -- my  mother 

came or not, I know I was, and I was by myself, so
 I don™t reme mber. What 
bothered me  most is 
I was walking back home  and some  neighbors wi
 -- with me  were walking too, how quickly 

those wome n adjusted to that idea. I -- I couldn'
t understand that. Mainly -- mainly accepting his 
premise, believing him, and saying we need to 
do what he say, and ma ybe that way we ™ll save 
our children. So they were eager to go home  a
nd prepare their children for that. I almost died 
then. 

Q: Because you didn™t believe it. 
A: Not a word.  
Q: Did you say anything to these wome n that 
you heard, or you just kept quiet and walked? 
A: No, but I went home, we talked and non -- 
nobody home  believed that
 either. Many people 
did not believe that. 

Q: Right. 

A: But I was surprised how ma ny pe ople did believe. 

Q: Right. Yeah.  

A: So imme diately. 

Q: Maybe they always believed him.  We  need to change the tape. 
End of Tape Five

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Paula, do you think what -- what do you thi
nk Rumkowski thought he wa
s telling people?  Did 
he believe that these kids w
ould be okay?  Did he not know? 
A: I don™t think he was so dumb. I 
he -- I think really that he wa
s calculating. In his work with 
[indecipherable] the other German, he was simply 
calculating how to save most of Je ws, how to 
help as ma ny as possible Jews to survive.
 And that™s how he was ma king the deals. 
Q: So as long as he could save some , it wouldn™t ma tter? 
A: Yeah. Against liquidating the whol
e ghetto. That could have happened. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, the Germans just could come  and 
erase the ghetto, you know
, any time, either by 
bomb or sending out people. They had the power. 

Q: Right. 

A: It -- so he was calculating how
 to ma ke the best deal against 
that possibility. I think he was 
sincere about it. 

Q: About doing that? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. Have you heard that speech again?  

A: Pardon?  

Q: Have you ever read his speech again?  

A: No, no. Is there -- is there -- 

Q: Yeah, I have it.  

A: On what, on paper? 

Q: Now I have it on paper, but I believe it™s on 
tape. Some  -- some how you can hear his words. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
79 
 
A: Mm-hm. Mm, I woul d be 
interested in hear ing it. 
Q: Let me  -- let me  just read you the last part of it for a second. 
A: Yes, okay. 

Q: ﬁA broken Jew stands before 
you,ﬂ he said. ﬁDo not envy me . This
 is the most difficult of all 
the orders I™ve ever had to carry out at any ti
me . I reach out to you with my broken, trembling 
hands and I beg, give in to my hands  the victims,
 so that we can avoid having further victims. 
And a population of a hundred thousand Jews can 
be preserved. So they promise me . If we 
deliver  our vi ctims by ourselves, there will be 
pe ace.ﬂ It™s quite a speech. But he clearly was 

trying to also talk about how
 diffi cult this was for him.  
A: Oh yes. I believe that. 

Q: Yeah. And you do believe it. 

A: I -- yes. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: He was a politician, a
nd traded in huma n life. 
Q: Right. 
A: And from the point of view as I told you when
 -- last August I saw this
 fairly large number of 
survivors of the ge -- lo -- ghett
o Lódz, I said, that is because of 
Rumkowski. Not that I love him, 
or admi re him. 

Q: No, right. 

A: But that™s a fact.  

Q: So the deal with the devil -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- worked in some respects. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
80 
 
A: That™s what I think. And the death of the 
president in Wa r saw ghetto didn™t produce anything 
but a loss of one human l i fe. 
Q: Czerniakow. 

A: Czerniakow. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. That doesn™t  say that I would not, give
n m- myself and that choi ce, I probably would kill 

myself rather than stand like Rumkowski, saying 
that. But in judging, what is more pr -- I want 
to say productive -- of what is more 
-- I don™t -- I don™t fi
nd a word for it. 
Q: Right. 

A: I -- I -- I cannot hate Rumkow
ski for it. You know I have some
 respect for him for that. And 
for his pain, as he was saying. 

Q: Right, right. D-Do you have any recollection 
of when you -- I know that you thought that the 
Germans were going to kill Jews. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: But the -- but they don™t start mur dering 
until 1941. There™s some mur ders, but there™s no -- 
the Einsatzgruppen come with the 
attack on Russia in 1941, and the 
-- the killing cen
ters start in 
™41 and ™42, and the ma jor killings are f -- 1942. Wh
en is it that you realize that what you think 
is going to happen is really happening?  Do you know
?  Is it in the mi ddle of
 the ghetto, is it when 
-- y-you have a friend who come s wi th her daughte
r to the Lódz ghetto -- 
I mean, she becomes a 
friend of yours. Now, this ma y be towards the en
d, I don™t know if this is
 1942 or it™s later, 1944, 
and she won™t give up her daughter. 

A: Oh -- oh, you -- oh, the story that I told. 

Q: Yes, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
81 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Is -- is she the one who convinced you that
 what you thought was happening was really 
happening, or did you think that before? 

A: I re -- since 1939 and before, listening to Hitl
er did not think that he
 is talking kwotch.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that the ﬁMein Kamp fﬂ book is just a boo
k of a sick mi nd. We took him very seriously, 
and I know we were listening to the radio for hour
s. The -- hi s speeches were transmitted live as 
it was happening in Berlin or wherever, so we ha
d a chance to listen to 
the radio, and sort of 
judging the speeches, and my father, my mother, 
myself, we knew he is speaking the truth, and 
that we have nothing to hope for if he is a-a
llowed to bring his plan forth. That is France, 
England -- we didn't talk about America, that 
was sort of, you know, outside of Europe. Unless 
they come  and stop him, he will br ing it to fruition, kill us. How, what, when, that was unknown, 

but we -- this projection we had way back.  
Q: So I guess when -- maybe you can repeat the st
ory that you told abou
t this friend, during the 
de -- it -- it -- that you told in 
the shi -- in the -- in 
the film, ﬁShoah.ﬂ Not in the film, in the -- in 
the interview that you did -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- it wasn™t in the film, because it app
eared as if it had a- an enormous impact. 
A: It was not in the film? 

Q: What?  No. 

A: He didn™t put it in the film?  

Q: Mm- mm.  

A: Hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
82 
 
Q: No. 
A: Okay, yes -- 

Q: No, your portion -- 

A: -- yes. 

Q: -- in the film was -- 

A: I know. That -- that™s right, I forget. 

Q: -- it -- it was -- it was much smaller. 

A: Yes, yes.  

Q: But this is a story about this woma n who co
mes in, she must be in her 20™s, ma ybe not so 
much older than you -- 

A: That™s right, that™s right -- 

Q: -- with the daughter. 

A: -- yes, in 20™s. And I know that
 I work then -- then I worked
 in the housing departme nt, and 
she came from the line, you know, she is fr om a little town, she name d the town, you know, 

close to Lódz. And she says is -- she is with th
e daughter so she needs housing for herself and the 
daughter. He r husband was the Alteste of the --of the -- the small Jewish community. He was 

taken away and killed with others, and she is he
re. And in my heart was going out to her, she was 
-- so I -- there was a room in my 
-- in the house that I was living, so 
I told her to go 
there and see, 
and if it is okay, she can move in. And then I 
st arted to contact with her and we -- we became 
good friends and talked, you know, a lot. And she wa
s telling me  about the life there, and th -- 
and you know that in the end, i-it w-was just kill
ed off then -- you know, and she is sent here, 

etcetera. So, it was nice to have -- she was a very warm, s mart woma n, and a cute kid, nine years 

old, a little gi rl. And then it came, you know, the 
speech of Rumkowski, and she said never. You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
83 
 
know, I will never give up my child. So we still ha
d few days to talk about it, so we talked at 
length, and I said, ﬁMy God, what 
are you going to do? ﬂ  So she said, ﬁNever will I give up 
voluntarily my daughter.ﬂ And I agreed with he
r, you know, I -- I was not 
quarreling. And then 
the day came of our street being run, you know, 
with SS troops, and comi ng, and they ask all 
population of a given building to go in the backya
rd and line up. And two, three SS guys with, 
you know, bayonets came into the yard. I was sta
nding close to my fre -- I forget her name  -- 
close to my friend. And they said
 -- announced, all childre
n of this and this age, please come . 
And she was holding the girl™s
 hand tightly. And, you know, she was not budging. Other kids 
came forth. And then the SS guy come s to her and sa
ys, bring -- takes the girl™s hand and wants 
to pull her away, and she said no. And he saidin German, ﬁIf you don™t let go, I will shoot you.ﬂ 
And she says, ﬁOkay, shoot me .ﬂ So he takes 
her by the neck, turns 
her around, and puts the 
revolver to her neck and shoots. And she falls to
 my feet, on my feet. An
d I hardly could stand. 
And he took the girl.  
Q: Anyway. Right. 
A: You see? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Rumkowski™s philosophy a-and the reality, an
d how can you say anythi ng, just don™ t ask me  
any questions about it, cause there are no answers.
 For three days I could not talk and could not 
eat, and my mother started to worry about me
. And then there was no choice but to live.  
Q: I™m not sure exactly what I ha
 -- I have thoughts in my -- my 
head, I™m not quite sure what to 
ask you about this because I -- on the one hand I thought to myself, she -- she had to know they 

would take her daughter no ma tch you -- no ma tter wh
at she did, and worse come s to worse they 
would shoot her and then the daughter would die, too. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
84 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And so I™m just wondering, what was -- what 
-- what must have been going through -- and 
you don™t know what was going through her head, because she had to know if they were going to 

shoot her, they were goi
ng to take the daughter.  
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And I guess one would just sa
y it was an impossible situati
on whichever way she did it, she 
was going to die. 

A: But she was not going to agree. 

Q: Agree to it, period.  

A: Give her life first before agreeing. I 
can understand that. Over my dead body, it says. 
Q: Right, right. Ri-Right. 

A: Literally. 

Q: Yes. And the daughter was -- you think was gassed? 
A: Sure. 
Q: Yes.  

A: Unless by some  fluke she could escape or some thing.  

Q: Right, right. Wa s this the first time you saw a dead person? 

A: Oh no, you could see ma ny dead pe
ople on the streets of the ghetto. 
Q: But this was some body you knew, and pretty well. 

A: Yeah -- ye -- my grandmother died in the ghetto. My -- my uncle died in the ghetto.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So I went to the funerals of my fa mily.  

Q: And so they™re buried in Lódz. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
85 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And after three days you said, I have to go on.  

A: Yes, somehow I revived.  

Q: So this was 1942, this was in the mi ddle -- 

A: Mm-h m 

Q: -- of the ghetto. But deportation m
eant death to you, that was clear. 
A: It was not clear,
 but it was clear. 
Q: It wasn™t known, but it was -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the intent was clear. 

A: How did we -- there were peopl
e that came  to the ghetto, some  
people that lived in the ghetto 
in Lódz, and were deported, and somehow run aw
ay and came , you know, sort of on the black -- 
black side -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to the ghetto, and they 
brought news. One first news wa
s about Chelmno. You -- y-you -- 
you know the name. 

Q: Yes, I was going to ask you, yes. 

A: That was -- that  was a small time -- town, not 
far from the city, and that is where the first 
experime nt with gas were done in buses. So thos
e guys that escaped, escaped that, but they were 
witness to what™s going on, and escape. So we 
knew about the gassing, etcetera. Then there were 
other news, also from pe op -- you know, we got 
a lot of mail from people that were deported, 
that they are in camp like that, and everything 
is fi -- you know, that was all hoax. But some  
people came, and they brought news from Auschwitz
, and that we could not
 believe, that there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
86 
 
were factories to gas people and burn their bodies
, crematoria. We  could not believe, but they 
were circulat e -- those ne
ws were circulating. 
Q: But Chelmno you believed? 
A: Pardon?  

Q: People believed what was going on in -- in Chelmno -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but not Auschwitz? 

A: That™s right. I -- are -- or -- impossible. 
And it -- but those were pe
ople they were talking 
about, so it was sort of, we don™
t want to believe that, but -- 
Q: Right, right, right. 

A: -- hey, you have to pay attention. 

Q: Right. 

A: So there were news like that 
of what™s happeni
ng in the world.  
Q: Wa s there a lot of corruption in Lódz, 
you think?  That™s a -- that™s a lot, huh? 
A: Yes.  

Q: It™s inevitable though, isn™t 
it, under those circumstances, sin
ce there™s no -- was there a black 
ma rket?  Even though it was so isolat
ed, there was a black ma rket?   
A: I think so. 

Q: So when I say was there corruption and you l
ook the way you did, what is it -- what -- what is 
it that™s going through your head? 

A: Through my s -- head is I ca -- 
I -- I cannot tell her anything 
concrete that I know, any facts 
[indecipherable] he told me
 so, but I know there was. 
Q: Yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
87 
 
A: Part of the cor -- not corruption but sort 
of tangentially, wer -- my experience was following. 
My father was working, I was working, my sister 
was in school for a couple of years and then 
she got some job to work. My mother was not 
working. And we began to worry about it because 
she could be the next deported person. So the que
stion was how do we get -- we need to get her a 
job. Who will get her a job?  My father could not 
hit right. And then was the -- also the peculiar 
situation in ghetto of reversed roles. You know, the people -- kids
 like my self that were comi ng 
of age in the ghetto, but they were children in
 school, but by the time it was going on, they were 
17 - 18. There was the support of the -- of the ghett
o. That on them leaned the economy of life in 
the ghetto. Those were the people with strengt
h, that could work and buy time for Rumkowski 
from the Germans. So all of the sudden I becam
e very important in the group -- in the populati -- 
in the, you know, population. And influential. 
So my father said, ﬁWell you have to do 
some thing.ﬂ But what can I do?  We  have to do 
something. At this time I was working in this 
housing departme nt which had couple bosses, one 
older ma n, and his assistant -- I forget their 
name s, Wolf -- one was Wolfe, the young one wasWolfe, and the older I don™t reme mber. And 
the -- you know, older guy and 
his assistant was the younger guy, 
and they -- you know, we had 
very good relationship, they respected me , I respected
 them, i-it was nice. So I said, I have to go 
to both of them and ask if they can find a job 
for Mother. It wa s a dangerous step, because you 
had to pay. And what does a young gi
rl pay?  How does a young girl pa
y?  Sex, right? So that was 
written in big letters. Am I willing to pay that fo
r my mother getting a job?
 I had to count on that, 
when I go to one or the other. That™s how Ru
mkowski come s in that category, too. Wh en people 
came, wome n, particularly young wome n ca me  to 
him with begging for some  favor, like for a 
sick person to get some  me dicine, or what n -- 
extraordinary thing, they had to pay. So I said, 

what do I do?  And I cannot talk 
to Fa ther about that. So I said, well, God help me , and I go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
88 
 
both of them. But to one, the older one, he was a chief, and tell him such and such, and I need a 
job for Mother, to keep her alive. Wh at can I te
ll you my surprise that he
 didn™t ask for a prize, 
and he got Mother a job in a 
kitchen in some  resort, you know
, in some  factory. And Mother 
started to work. I was surp
rised, but pleasantly, you know? 
Q: Absolutely. 

A: So that was a one thing. The other thing was Mo
ther worked in that factory, the director was 
Mrs. Sandberg, who was the father of my classm
a t e in gr ade school, and we knew each other -- I 
forgot her name , first name , but 
not closely, but she -- she was a 
nice kid and I think she thought 
me , too. I knew her parents from all kinds of a
ffa irs for kids. Her fath
er had a horrible opinion, 
you know, as a explorator, as a bad guy, as nobody to ta
lk to, y -- just -- that was the opinion of 
Mrs. -- about Mr. Sandberg. Her mother was a 
nice lady. Mother was very happy working there. 
I told you my mother s -- wished to work -- 

Q: Yes. She finally -- 
A: -- and she could not. She got a job. And wa
s she happy. She really was happy. She was going 
in the morning, she worked in the kitchen, peelin
g potatoes, all kinds of stuff, but being among a 
bunch of wome n -- my mother was an excelle
nt talker, you know, and communi -- you know, 
sort of with people, she was a 
-- enjoyed it and was liked, and she 
would come  back with stories. 
And I said, ﬁMother, I never saw you so happy.ﬂ 
And also, in the kitchen, we -- they we re 
allowed some  stealing. They could take some  -- firs
t of all, they were allowed to do is to bring 
home  potato peels. Some thing that you throw out. 
Q: Throw away, yes. 

A: Potato peels.  

Q: It™s good for you, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
89 
 
A: Absolutely.  
Q: Right. 

A: That was delicious food. Motherwould cook a kugel from potato peels. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes, and all kind of things. So it was f
ood for  the family. And she smuggled few potatoes 
with it, so we had few potatoes. So she was 
double happy for herself and 
that she could bring 
something home from the job. Make me very
 happy, you know, it was just nice to see that 
woma n, under those conditions 
really thriving. Then one da
y comes the order through Mr. 
Sandberg, as it was comi ng to all directors of th
e factories, to supply by that date, that ma ny 
workers of his to send out to -- for relocation. 
It wa s called relocation, 
to another ghetto. Right?  
So Mother is in danger, and in serious danger. 
And what do I do?  Mother says, go and talk to Mr. 
Sandberg. 

Q: This time Mother says it, uh-huh. 
A: I ma y be sent out. Oh. I was beside myself. I 
didn™t want to go. He™s a mean -- I say, ﬁMother, 
he is a mean ma n, I ma y ma ke it worse.ﬂ And she 
says, ﬁDon™t worry, just go and talk to him.ﬂ I 
walked the streets around my house half of the night
, what do I do, what do I do?  So I did -- first 
of all I went to talk to Mrs. Sandberg, the 
wife. And she knew me , you know, I was a classmate 
of her daughter, and I said, look, such and such, I don™t know what to ask you for, but please 
understand where we are. She didn™t say anythin
g, yes, no, whatever, nothing. And then I ma de 

an appointme nt to see Mr. Sandberg, and I did 
see him, and he  was nice enough. Not nice really, 

but polite enough. And I begged him fo
r my mother™slife. We ll, he 
didn™t put her on the list. But 
you asked me what were the fi -- 
feeling, living like that. You see 
this horror of those feelings?  
And horror of ever -- of being 
forced, not by my parents, by wh
at™s going on, to do some thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
90 
 
that you ma y think that you contribute to your mo
ther™s death one way or another. Could have 
happened very easily. 
Q: Right. 

A: He could have said, I have no c
hoice. What would you do in my place? 
Q: Right. 

A: Things like that. But that worked out th
at way. How does it leave you internally?  Ce rtainly 
not with a feeling of power. A feeling of rage, of
 anger, that you cannot 
get riv -- rid of through 
your lifetime. 

Q: Do you also think of the other side, 
your mother saved, but some body else goes?  
[indecipherable] 

A: That™s true, but I di
dn™t think that far. 
Q: Not then, no. 

A: Mm- mm. But of course some body -- you know, there was -- 
Q: Yes, somebody™s got to go. 
A: -- yes. He  had to -- he had to produce the number of people -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- the Germans wanted. Rumkows ki and the Ge rmans wanted.  

Q: But to go beg for someone™s life is not
 -- it™s not what one 
wants to do in life. 
A: No.  

Q: We  have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Six 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
91 
 
Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: This -- the -- the tales you we
re just telling about going an
d trying to get work for your 
mother came after I talked a
bout corruption in the ghetto. 
A: Yes, mm-hm.  
Q: And clearly you think 
that these examples show in what
 sense there wa s corruption in the 
ghetto. Can -- can you explain that
 a little bit more, why -- why you think so, even though these 
me n never asked you for sex. 

A: No, personally, I was afraid of that because 
we knew -- knew stories -- of the stories where 
young women would go asking for a favor, includ
ing Rumkowski, and they had -- you know, 
they were sexually assaulted, and they had to submitif they wanted this vital -- begging to take -- 

you know, to be gratified. Had to do 
with saving a life of a mother, a sister, etcetera. So in that 
way there was corruption of the people that  had positions, they had the power to demand pay-

offs, and in a sexual way from -- from wome n. Th
at what I meant [indecipherable] what I said. 
Q: Right. So this provides an example of 
what you ma y not know in terms of your personal 
existence, but assume d that there was a lot of different -- 

A: Oh, we heard about it -- 

Q: -- kinds of corruption going on. 

A: -- yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: There were circulating stor
ies that wome n wer e  telling ab
out, and warning other people. 
Q: And was there other kinds of corruption?  
People paying off people to not be put in 
deportations?  Do you know? 

A: I don™t know enough about it
 to really speak of it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
92 
 
Q: Yes, yes. 
A: I™m sure there were.  

Q: What was -- what were the relationships like
? Well -- well let me do it smaller fi rst. Ho -- 
how were the relations with your parents and your
 sister during this period?  Wa s -- did things 
become  mor e  tense, or was it easy?  I -- were 
you angry at your parents because yo -- there was a 
role reversal, and they weren™t protecting you, 
you were now protecting 
them in some way? 
A: There was a anger that you probably could not 
admit even to yourself, 
knowing the situation. 
No, anger with my father that he
 told me  you have to find a job, of
 course I was angry, but I had 
to keep it in, most of it, because -- because he 
was right. It was this role
 reversal in the ghetto 
that the young people were ma de to take over, make
 decisions, give yi -- 
e-etcetera. They were 
also the people that the life of the ghetto depe
nd on, because they had the strength to work, and 
the older generation was sort of losing this 
physical strength of work
ing the factories.  
Q: So you think it was the younger people who we
re -- who kept the ghetto going, really. 
A: Yes. They were given the role, not that th
ey asked for, but by the exhaustion of the older 
generation of their st rength by doing that work for a year or  two under conditions of hunger, 

losing weight, illnesses, the younger were comi ng 
up, they had the strength to work. So they 
could not complain, but they were angry for sure.  

Q: They were? 

A: I was, sure. 

Q: Yes. Because you were given a burden you di
dn™t -- you would have preferred not to have. 
A: That™s right, I didn™t ask for it, and -- andit was a burden of saving the life of your mother. 

You know, that™s not small potatoes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
93 
 
Q: No, it™s not. Now I -- i-in some  of the work
 that -- that I™ve done, 
I noticed that for long 
periods of time in the ghetto, the me n had more 
jobs, ma ny more jobs than the wome n did. Now 
I don™t know whether as a person living in the gh
etto you could even notice that. Did -- did you 
notice that there were more me n wo
r king at certain jobs?  I don™t m
ean just that  ther e was a male 
police force, I -- I don™t --
 I don™t me an that, but even in th
e factory, were there ma ny more me n 
than there we re wome n?  

A: Look, when we went into the war, and into
 the ghetto, the structur
e of society was not 
dissimilar in th-the structur
e of my fa mily. The men wo
rked, the wome n kept house. 
Q: Right. 

A: So, in the ghetto too, the primary role of 
me n was to get a job and bring the bacon, ma ybe 
salami , right? But there 
was no salami  either.  
Q: Right. 

A: Right?  It was only because --
 and of course there were so
me jobs that women from the 
beginning, like the sewing job, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- they sew -- I mean what -- th
ey ma king -- were ma king clothing -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- clothing, so they were sewing machine, 
and for those job wome n 
were hired, and wome n 
did that before the war, too. So some  of t
hose jobs were -- you know, sort of wome n were 
working, young wome n, older wome n, but the ma jority job wa s men™s job. 

Q: So does that mean that more women, do you 
think, were deported, because they didn™t have 
jobs, so they™re more vulnerable to deportation? 

A: Not necessarily, becau -- becaus
e women started to -- to work. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
94 
 
Q: To work, uh-huh. 
A: They got jobs, and they started 
to work. And -- in bigger numbers. 
Q: Right. 

A: There was a hat factory, they were ma king 
hats. There was the sewing factory, the wome n 
were -- were working and ma king all kinds of 
apparels. So, you know, those were jobs that 
wome n could easy fit in. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Kitchen work, wome
n were doing that. 
Q: So did you ni -- besides the -- the corruption of
 -- of me n being in certain positions of power 
and being able to say, you want this, you know -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- pay for it, sleep with me , right? 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: We re there other ways in which you thi
nk there was a kind of a -- using the word 
discrimi nation is a har -- is a st
range -- strange word, but that th
ere were di fferences be tween the 
lives that me n were leading and the lives that 
women were leading in th
e context of the ghetto. 
Where as this -- is this one very important, beca
use sexual exchange, that™s what wome n have to 
exchange. And so that would be a lot of 
what mi ght be going on in ma ny instances. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: So, do you think that that was the primary di
fference between men and women, that there was 

-- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
95 
 
A: Men were -- I mean, it was their experience from be fore the war, where me n were employed, 
and gain, as a group of me n, experience and know-how
 and in different jobs -- of course, in the 

ghetto me n got that differentiation too. 

Q: Yes, right. 

A: They were more fit for jobs, women were notprepared, they were not trained, muc h more so 

than nowadays, where wome n are everywhere. Bu
t years ago, that was a more patriarchal 
societ y, like in my fa mily, the men 
worked, the women stayed home.  
Q: Right. 

A: Wa s the housekeeper. So that was a big 
mi nus for wome n. They had to change -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- under conditions.  

Q: Let me  a sk you some thing. In -- 
in the interview with Lanzma nn -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- he asked you about thi -- ther
e was a part of the interview, 
not that™s on the screen, but in 
the -- about thinking, and at one 
point you said, I couldn't think, I 
had to withdraw, because if 
you thought, you would commit suicide. You would -- 
it -- it was impossible to think too much. 
Do you still think that about w
ho you were then, that you -- you r
eally, in order to survive, you 
simply had to keep going in some  practical way? It -- 
A: Of course. 

Q: Uh-huh. So too much consciousness could ki
ll you, too, in some  -- in some  respects. 
A: We ll, I think I was pretty much conscious of 
what™s going on, and in ta
lking with Father and 
Mother, you know, we were not s
uppressed of not thinking, and go on. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
96 
 
A: But you -- you had to, fore most -- I told you, we  
shall overcome. I was not conscious of that 
sentence then, but the philosophy was, go 
on, survive and tell the story. Which -- 
Q: That really was conscious? 

A: Oh yes.  

Q: Did you know people who didn™t feel that wa
y?  Who really went down -- not to --  
A: They did not survive. 
They got sick and died. 
Q: So what do you think is the difference?  What
 is -- what i -- what is it about you and your 
fa mily, you think?  Does -- I mean, is there an -- 
even any way to know what it is that kept you 
going that way? 

A: I was raised that way. Don™t ask me --  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Well ask me, you know, I™m just telling you it™s -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- very hard to -- to answer that question. I was raised that way on one hand with tremendous 
love and care, and a certain discipline. And one ex
ample of that is like that . I remember -- I told 
you we lived with my grandparents, entrance, a 
little hall, kitchen, ba
throom, you go in a big 
dining room, old fashioned, with old fashione
d furniture, you know, the 
carved furniture. My 
grandparent™s bedroom, and then th
e last room was a very huge room, that was our family room. 
It was a dining room and a bedroom at the same
 time, a children -- everything, but a big room, a 
huge table in the mi ddle, oval table, and a lam
p, a ceiling lamp from the  ceiling and I reme mber 
it had a green -- light green silk -- what
 do you call this outside of the lamp? 
Q: Ah, lamp shade. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
97 
 
A: Lampsha de, and lights in the mi ddle. And 
that was the pl ace where everythi ng was taking 
place. We would eat there, I would make homewor
k. And homework my father was involved for 
a number of years with me , doing e very day home work. And I would work with my  father, he 
was a pai -- he painted well, he
 drew well, and he showed me  
how, and all that. And I reme mber 
one scene, I was sitting with my father, and he
 wa s watching me  drawing, and watching. And I 

reme mber I drew a bunch of lilac. Blue lilac. So that was a little branch
 with blue lilac and 
leaves. And I was very busy drawing that, my 
father on this side. And I looked up, and there™s 
my mother standing beside me , and s haking her h
ead to what my father saying, she™s doing very 
well, you know, without saying. And I looked, and I was so ha ppy, because my mother was not 

one to gr -- congratulate me  or  tell me you™re doing well, neve
r, okay?  I was doing, it was my 
job, whatever, and that™s it. It was the only time th
at I saw she really care
s. And she approves of 
the work that my father is doing with me . And 
that me mory s urvived untouched for all those 
years. 
Q: And that™s what gave you 
a kind of strength, you think? 
A: I think so.  
Q: You think so? 

A: I think so. Approval and stre
ngth. Silent approval, not appr
oval gushing you™re great and so 
on, to blow up my head, but approval. And you know, a me ssage. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t have to tell you that. The -- only one
 time  you can see that, but you know. You should 
know. 

Q: But you also had some thing from your grandm
other who was so affectionate, and clearly 
loved you a lot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
98 
 
A: Oh yes. It was another me mory. I told you, I 
could always jump in her lap and she would hold 
me -- 
Q: Right. 

A: --and caress me , and so on. And then too, th
ere was a time -- you know, the -- really, my 
parents had it good, she was a 
built-in babysitter, right? 
Q: Right. 

A: You know. 

Q: Right. 

A: She was not going out mu- much. So I stayed a
nd they would go out, and they would go out to 
see the concert and so on. Later 
they, when I grew up more, they were taking me  Jewish theater 
and other theater, so I wa s -- and I got to know
 the writers and actors because I would come  
often with my father to the admi nistration, to 
the newspaper room, and there were always some 
actors and writers bringing book -- 
you know, eager to be, you know, 
put into the press. And I 
would shake hands, three years, four years old, w
ith the biggest Jewish actors in town, that 
would come  for shows and so on. It was wonderf
ul, you know?  So this night they were going to 
theater, and I stayed home  and I got sick. As 
a kid I would get often 
sick with croup, you know, 
this bad cough?   

Q: Right. 

A: Croupy cough. And I was coughing and 
coughing and crying, Mama , Mama . My 
grandmother got scared and she called the ambul
ance, you know, because she didn™t know what 
to do with me. The ambulance came , and then my
 parents came, so [ind
ecipherable] they still 
here, the ambulance people left, and my mother got
 furious with grandmother and told her, she 
just fooled you, you should know better. [indeci
pherable]. Never do it again. You should not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
99 
 
have called the ambulance, because there™s nothi
ng wrong with her. She just had the croup. That 
was my mot her, too. 
Q: Wa s she right? 

A: Yes. 

Q: That you were exaggerating? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And you knew it. 

A: Yeah, I thought she was right, 
later on particularly. Whe n I 
became a mother. That was an 
example. My mother was a doctor, she didn™t need
 any other doctors, she 
was herself the doctor. 
Q: Right, she -- she knew. 

A: She knew. 

Q: Did you get sick in the ghetto, besides being 
hungry and turning into sk
eletons, sort of?  No. 
A: No. 
Q: Doesn™t that surprise you?  Under thos
e conditions that 
you never got sick? 
A: Maybe I had a cold or so, but I don™t -- 
Q: No, I mean -- 

A: -- reme mber being seriously ill. 

Q: Oh. 

A: No. 

Q: Not your parents either? 

A: In the ghetto? Yes, my mother
 got very ill. She got ill with 
dysentery and was very, very ill. 
And I was on the -- on the farm, living on the farm 
then. And that was the only time that I needed 
help for my mo -- mothe r , it was some medica
tion, or food stamps, you know. And didn™t want 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
100 
 
to go to Rumkowski, but I went to some body 
else. What -- you say, what was her -- his 
secretary. 
Q: Fuchs? 

A: Fuchs. 

Q: Oh, Dora Fuchs -- 

A: Dora Fuchs, or some body else. 

Q: -- was the secretary. 

A: And they gave me  some  -- what I needed fo
r my mother. And then 
she recovered. But my 
father took care of her, not I. 

Q: Because you were away. 

A: I was away. And -- and he wouldn™t let me  either, you know, they took care of each other. 

Q: What sort of medicine is there 
for dysentery? Do you know?  [indecipherable] 
A: I don™t know, whatever it was -- 
Q: It helped. 
A: -- or ma ybe it was some  cottage cheese, some
 spec -- special dairy product that was to be 

helpful. But that™s when I needed -- a-and then 
when I tell you that different people needed some  
help -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- from t here up -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- on special occasions. But, it was frightful. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
101 
 
Q: In -- in general, what were the relations
hips like among pe ople?  We re -- were peop -- was 
their solidarity in the ghetto, or
 was everybody out for themselves, or out for their small family 
group?  How do you remember other people? 
A: It was mi xed. I don™t know if I paid much 
attention. I -- you know, told you about my getting 
into the friendship with the woma n whose da
ughter was taken away. And there was another 
friendship or  relationship that I developed ther
e, and that was also a Czech woma n. The cze -- 
the Czech transport was so outstanding. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Such wonderful people. Really unbelievable. 
So this woman was talking with me  about the 
place to live. So I gave he r, you know, we looked through the -- what™s availabl e, and wrote out 

where she should go. And she went and she came b
ack, and she says, it™s wonderful, I love it. 
Let me  do a favor to you. Can I give you this, and 
she takes out a tchocki 
or some thing. I said, 
ﬁNo, nothing.ﬂ Can I give you some  money?  I ha
ve to do some thing, I have to tell you thank 
you. She came back again. And I was telling my mo
ther what was happening, and thi -- she said, 
ﬁLook, I am very good dressmaker. Let me sew you a dress.ﬂ So I came home -- and I said no, 

no, no. Listen, I am happy that you™re happy [i
ndecipherable]. So I came home and I told 
Mother, and Mother said, ﬁPaula, let her do some
thing for you.ﬂ So ma  -- Mother took out a 
green dress of grandmother that was very beautiful ma terial, and was old and grandmother by 

that time, either was before she died, or ma ybe aft e r she died. And Mother
 said, ﬁGive her this 
dress, and let her sew you a dress.ﬂ Which I did.
 And that was great. The dress didn™t look so 
[indecipherable] 

Q: The dress didn™t look so great? So
 tell me , what is it -- what is 
when you tell that story, what™s 
-- what -- why does it move you so much, do you think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
102 
 
A: I think because it™s about my mother.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And her relationship with me , that I could talk 
to her, tell her, and sh
e would always give me  
the right answer, that still now today seems very 
correct. I didn™t want to 
take jewelry, I didn™t 
want to take money, but 
let her sew you a dress. 
Q: Let her do some thing for you. 

A: Yes, and let her do some thing. 

Q: Right.  

A: We ll, that was one sort of relations
hip, other than that, what can I say? 

Q: What about the Germans?  There™s a -- the Germ
ans have their admi nistrative office inside the 
ghetto, which is not the most usual procedure in 
these ghettos. So does that mean that you have 
contact with these Germans?
 Or you don™t have contact? 
A: God forbid. 
Q: Gosh -- 
A: That was, you know, the center of the ghetto 
was the -- the marketplace from be fore the 
ghetto was formed, and through the ghetto, and now,
 because I visited in Lódz. So those were 

ma rketplaces where people were comi ng, you know, 
sell their wares and so on. That was turned 
in -- into the center of the ghetto admi nistration. 
It mean rums -- Rumkowski™s office was there, 

his secretaries, and other people in the admi ni
stration, and the German hea dquarters. Beside 
there, there was another building that was the 
Gestapo. And that was fearsome  to walk across 
that, because atrocities were 
happening there. People called for no reason for interrogation, for 
confiscation, for killing. So that was the German
 influence in the ghetto. Now, on this Balutski 
rinnek, Rumkowski was there and if you want -- if
 you needed a audience with him, it™s where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
103 
 
you would go, or a audience with this Miss Fuchs, that™s where you would go. And that was a 
place too, that you don™t pass easily, or 
go in easily. Part of that Balutski rinnek was also dedic -- 

sort of kept for transport for -- let™s say for 
vegetables and fruit. Fruit we didn™t have, but 
vegetables. Frozen cabbage, frozen
 potatoes, all kinds of
 things, that™s where they were dished 
out, you know, if you -- if you got to know that th
ere is some thing there, and you came  so you -- 
you got some. So that wa s part of -- o-of th
at center, too. And that
 was it. There were no 
Germans -- well, there were Germa ns around th
e border of the ghetto, you know, and -- the 
sentries, and the Gypsies across the ghetto. 

Q: And [indecipherable] there™s no -- there 
was no interaction betw
een the Jews and the 
Gypsies?  

A: No way.  

Q: No. There were about 5000 Gypsie
s, I gather, in that section. 
A: I don™t know the number, but we kne
w they are there, and that was it. 
Q: Did you know where they came from?  

A: Hungary, Roma nia. That 
sort of come s to mi nd. 

Q: You know, I ask you about the Ge rmans because I ask you so ma ny questions about the 

internal relationship amongst the Jews, and it is
n™t the Jews who for med the ghetto, or who 
decided upon this proces
s, it was the Germans. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So I need to ask you about the Germans to see 
what sort of relationship. So did you ever see 
Biebow?  No. Did -- Himmler visited -- you didn
™t see, no. Nothing. Do you reme mber ever 
seeing Rumkowski walk around, or be on his -- was -- 
did he have a -- a ca
r that he rode in?   
A: He had a car, I told you I saw him few times -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
104 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- when he was comi ng courting his future wife -- 

Q: His wife. 

A: -- on our street. Other than that, the one re
ma rkable place, it was the graduation from school 
that, you know, he was present and you know, aske
d the student and parent and he wa s giving 

speeches and how proud he was and how grateful -- how
 great he felt to gr aduate a bunch of kids 
from high school. 

Q: Right. Do you reme mber seei
ng him wearing high boots? Some one
 said he wore very high 
boots. 

A: Like the Germans?  

Q: Yeah. [indecipherable] ma ybe like the Germans. 

A: No, I didn™t. 

Q: No, huh? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: There were hangings in the 
ghetto, weren™t there?  And were 
you forced to see these wi -- you 
were.  

A: Mm. 

Q: So was everybody in the ghetto forced to -- 

A: The hanging were on a little -- not place, but a -- a 
little marketpl ace, other than this Balutski 
rinnek. And there were buildings 
around that ma rket, and one of 
the building was the office of 
housing, where I worked. And when the hanging we
re happening, we were asked to come  down 
and watch. 

Q: To watch people being -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
105 
 
A: The hanging. 
Q: -- hung. 

A: Being hung. 

Q: That mus t  have been really awful. 

A: Forced. We were forced. 

Q: You were forced. 

A: To see. 

Q: More than once? 

A: More than once. And there were speeches of 
course, that I think once those guys, they were 
trying to run away from the ghetto and they were
 caught, or others were
 stealing or whatnot, you 
know, but they were hung. 

Q: And who was doing the hanging?  The 
Germans?  Or could you tell, even? 
A: No Ger man. Jews were doing the killing. Ge
r-Germans we re there on their post, you know, 
watching it all, supervising it. 
Q: But the so-called [indecipherable] 

A: But there were the Jews that were hanging, yeah. 

Q: Okay, I think we need to change tapes. 
End of Tape Seven

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Paula, did -- did you -- was there some thing ca
lled the chronicles of 
the Lódz ghetto that you 
read, people put out a newspaper of some  kind w
ith the news on it? Or was the chroni cle a sort 
of underground? 
A: Don™t recall, really. 

Q: You don™t recall, okay. 

A: But we had a thea
ter and concerts -- 
Q: You did. 

A: -- in the ghetto, yes, mm-hm. 

Q: And were they good? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And did you go often? 
A: I went enough, you know, we had quite few time s. 

Q: Like once a week, or less than that? 

A: I don™t think they were that often. 

Q: They weren™t that often. 

A: Maybe once a month, or so. 

Q: Did some bo -- did you ha
ve to pay to get in? 
A: Yes, ghetto money, which was worthless anyway, so it was sort of -- what could you get for 

it? A concert. 

Q: But the ghet -- but the ghetto mone
y functioned inside the ghetto, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
107 
 
A: That™s right, you could, you know, you could buy 
bread and other st-stuff with the ghetto 
money, yes.  

Q: Did it have his picture on it, Rumkowski? 

A: I cannot tell you, 
I don™t recall. 
Q: Do you reme mber pictures of Rumkowski up in offices? 

A: I don™t think so. 

Q: You don™t think so. 

A: And if there we
re, I don™t recall. 
Q: Maybe you didn™t want to see them, if they were. 

A: That™s for sure. 

Q: In August there was going to -- th
ere was a deportation, right, that™s -- 
A: ™44. 

Q: -- when they start, 1944. 
A: 1944. 
Q: Do you hear about this sort of liqui dation 
-- it™s not exactly a liqui dation because people 

aren™t being killed the
n, they™re being sent out. 
A: Mm-hm, but that was a 
liquidation of the ghetto. 
Q: Yes. 

A: It stopped existing. 

Q: Right. 

A: The structure stopped existing. 

Q: Right. And does -- it stopped before August,
 I as -- I imagine. Or am I wrong? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
108 
 
A: End of August was the lasttransport that left the -- you 
know, the ghetto. And Rumkowski 
was on that -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- transport. Now they left a crew of Jews 
on the Balutski rinnek you know, in the center, to 
clean up. You know, clean up the sp
ace, put away stuff, etceter
a, clean up. And a good number 
of those people, I think two -- 300 pe
ople were able to hide in the last mi nute, and survived. Th -
- it was shortly before the Russian troops ma rched in. So a good number -- good number, 200 or 

so -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Jews saved their lives, the ones that worked on -- on the Balutski rinnek, and were asked to 

stay to clean up. 

Q: You were not asked to stay. 

A: Oh no, I did -- I didn™t work there. 
Q: Right. 
A: Those were workers there. 

Q: Who wor ked in -- in that area. 

A: Yeah, that™s right, yes. 

Q: So what happened to you and your fa mily 
at that -- at that time during the August 
deportations? 

A: During the August deportation, 
y-you had to ma ke a decision to go voluntarily or not, you 
know?  There was a station, a train station called
 Radogoszcz, where the trains were set up to 
leave. And you had to make up your mi nd if -- you 
were assigned a day where to -- when to go. I 

don™t reme mber how it happened. And I said, ﬁI 
am not going voluntarily. I am not going.ﬂ And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
109 
 
my mother wrung her ha -- ha -- hands, what do 
we do, and turning to me, what do we do. You 
know, I have to -- 
Q: You have to give -- 

A: -- to tell her what to do. So 
I say, ﬁI don™t know, but I don™t want
 to go.ﬂ So let™s try to hide. 
And we hid. I had a friend around there, and she ha
d a policeman that was sort of high up in the 
Sonderkomma ndo, and he knew what to do, but 
eventually didn™t know, nobody knew. So we 
were hiding in a place that already wa s evacuated
, but out -- out of a -- our house, because we 
had to get out of where we lived, so -- to be clos
e to the train station. So 
we hide -- we did hide 
in a house that was strange -- 
you know, we didn™t know it, but 
-- and spend a couple days or 
more, waiting for some  signal from God, or w
ho knows who, what to do. And then we were 
watching through the windows how 
the German SS were walking and pulling people out, and 
bring -- you know, ma rching them to the train st
ation. And we didn™t know what they do with 
them, do they shoot them on the way or not. So 
the outlook for successful hiding was ne-never -- 
not too good. And we we re losi ng -- we are losi ng
 the -- the willpower to hide and be dragged 
out and killed. So it was sort of what happe
ned to everybody, will happen to us too. You know, 
resignation. And one day we just showed up at th
e point where they were collecting people and 
ma rching them to the station of Radogoszcz, and pu
tting them on the cattle -- 
cattle train -- cattle 
wagons. And that™s how we landed there. 

Q: So this was you, your younger sister, your mother
 and your father. Your grandparents have -- 
A: Dead by then. 

Q: -- are dead by then. 

A: Yes.  

Q: And this is a train trip
 of a day, two days?  It™s ha
rd to reme mber, I imagine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
110 
 
A: It™s hard to reme mber how long it took. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: It™s a pretty fair distance, with a train that doesn™t 
go too fast. So hours, ma ny hours. 
Q: Was it awful on the train? 

A: Pretty awful. No wa
ter, no toilet, nothing. 
Q: Was there a bucket for a toilet? 

A: I don™t think there 
were buckets either. 
Q: How old are your parents by now?  You™re
 -- you™re now 22 years old, about.  

A: Yeah. My mother was 47 years 
old, my father was 51 years old. 
Q: An-And are they still strong? 

A: Pretty strong -- 

Q: They™re okay, they™re pretty strong. 

A: Yes, they were pretty -- in good health. 
Q: Right. So you get to Auschwitz, di 
-- you™ve heard abou
t Auschwitz?  Bef -- 
A: We heard the name mentione
d, but not really, we did not h
ear, other than we heard, you 
know, gas, and crematoria and death, mm-hm. 
Q: So is -- so is that what you expected? 

A: Yes. 

Q: That you would go there and you™d be killed? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you get off this train, is it daytime, nighttime , morning? 

A: Was daytime. 

Q: Daytime. A train with a lot of people on it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
111 
 
A: Lot of people, loaded, full trains. 
Q: And it™s a full train fro m Lódz? 

A: Lódz, mm-hm. And as we get unloaded, ther
e were SS men, few, but ma inly Jews working 
there, they were the sonderco -- Jewi sh jo 
-- Sonderkomma ndo, and they were unloading us. Get 
out, outsteigen, get out, and so on. And we ask, 
where are we ?  Where are we going?  And they 
said in Hebrew, to mi shpitt. 

Q: Mishpitt? 

A: Mishpitt is the -- the day of
 reckoning -- wa -- how do you say 
it, the day of -- the judgme nt, 
day of judgment, the judgme nt day. In Hebrew, mi
shpitt. So it was clear what they were sayi ng. 

Q: This is it. 

A: Death, to death, yes. So we are herded in 
groups and start ma rching. 
And of course, all the 
things that we were carrying with us, bundles or
 so, were taken away and thrown on the street, 

you know, next to the train. So we were reliev
ed of the luggage, and ma rched to the camp. 
Q: Now you™re -- the train come s up close to 
Birkenau, yes?  So you go -- but does the train go 
under this underpass, or are you outsi
de and you walk in, do you reme mb er? 
A: Life mu -- ﬁArbeit ma cht frei.ﬂ That was the big sign there were. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Work sets you free, ﬁArbeit macht freiﬂ.
 And we ma rched -- we
 didn™t know anything, 
Birkenau or not Birkenau, because they -- that
 pr obably the train stopped in Auschwitz proper 
and we were ma rched to Birkenau. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: Or we -- the train went to Birkenau and we 
were ma rched to the -- to the showers. You know, 
to the pl ace where we were greete
d, and the greeting was, take  off your clothes, stay na ked, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
112 
 
around were wome n, me n, and the firs
t thing that they were doing 
were shaving us. Our heads, 
all hair of our body. Man did that. I suppose th
at was Sonderkomma ndo, too, Jews doing it. And 
then we were -- 
Q: But you™re not with your father. You™re
 father™s been separated, or am I wrong? 
A: Take me  back. We  go, we walk, and then we
 -- we walk to the point where Mengele is 
standing, you know, the German physician, and 
says, you know, wome n l e ft, me n right, and me n 
go right away to the other side, and wo me n go to
 this side, and then we ma rch in front of 
Mengele. And so it is Mother, me  and my sister. A
nd he pulls Mother out to one side, and us to 

the other side. And I said, ﬁI want to go with Mo
ther.ﬂ I follow Mother, and he pulls me  out and 
sends me  to the other side, to left instead
 of right, which the right was going to --  
Q: [indecipherable]. How -- how did you know it was Mengele? 

A: I didn™t know it was Mengele. That was a 
physician, we knew a physician, people were 
talking, I don™t know who. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: But we later find out that -- you know, or pe
ople were talking because they knew from some 
of the Sonderkomma nd t hat this is Mengele, 
this is Mengele. So we knew the name .  
Q: Right. 

A: And the face, now the face, so we knew that
 was the physician of Auschwitz, the famous one. 
And then we go, I and my sister are left, and we 
are led to this big hole 
where, you know, we sat 
naked and shaved, and then led to showers. A
nd we knew already that the showers me an death, 
so -- and that was sort of -- we all were look
ing for -- you know, for death. As it happened, of 
course, the ones that we were with did not get killed, we were really taking showers, and given 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
113 
 
some  so-called clothing, one shoe 
high heeled, one shoe low heel
ed, and s -- coup -- and a couple 
of sort of schmates, and led to barrack
s, we were led then to the barracks. 
Q: We re you tattooed? 
A: No, our transport was not tattooed. 

Q: Hm. 

A: And there was a number of tr
ansport that -- I think it was 
August already and I don™t think 
they had time any more for things like -- for --
 for playful things like that, so we didn™t get 
tattooed. And we were led to the barracks, and 
a-acquainted with the ka
po, which was a woma n 
and her helper. And the kapo had, 
in this big barrack had a wonderful room, nicely furnished and 
all that, nice. She had a very important role, and 
was paid for that by special favors. And that™s 
how it star ted, life in Auschwitz st arted. So before we were sent to the barracks, we still had to 

stay on si -- c™est l™appel, which was counting 
down a -- how ma ny peopl e we are, and that took 
hours. It was way into the night. And then we we
re sent to the barracks, and given space enough 
-- not enough to stretch out. There we re like five
 in a row, five wome n in a row, not enough to 

stretch out, but just to curl up some how, and that
 was our first day and fi rst night in Auschwitz. 
Early in the morning was c™est l™appel again, wh
ere we were standing an
d were counted. Every 
day, twice a day, was hours, it took hours to be c
ounted. And the number better be right, or else 
we were -- 

Q: Otherwise they count again. 

A: Hm?  

Q: Otherwise they count again, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
114 
 
A: Right. And there were incidents where so
me body would run away, and we would stand for 
hours, and then that person was brought back and killed. And so, you know, to give an example 
what happens if you think of runni
ng away. And life st
arted there.  
Q: That™s a bit ironic, is
n™t it?  Life starts -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Now, did you know rather soon what
 probably happened to your mother? 
A: Of course. We  knew right away. 

Q: You knew right away. 

A: Yeah. Those people were sent o -- 
didn™t know what happened to Father. 
Q: Right. 

A: I found out much later on, you know, in Lódz, when I was back in Lódz from a friend of 
Father, that was with him in th
e same  ca mp, they were sent off to ca mp s outside Auschwitz, and 
I think he told me  that my father died in one
 of those ma rches to another camp, on the way. So, 
he died. If he  was -- I assume  that he was 
killed, you know, because in a ma rch, whe n you si -- 
when you slow down, there was the SS ma n then he
lped you die quicker. So I assume that what 
happened to Father. 

Q: Now, a number of hours ago when we started,
 and I asked you about your relationship to your 
sister, it wasn™t -- you didn™t like th
at she was there, blah, blah, blah. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: But some thing changed in Auschwitz. So now -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
115 
 
A: Yes, y-y-you see, though Mother was very car
eful not to load me , the older sister with 
responsibility for my -- for my sister, neverthele
ss, it was I was the older sister, and I didn™t like 
it, you know?  If she didn™t
 load me , I thought she expect me  anyhow to help her with home work, 
and s -- so I had the special duty of an older si
ster that I did not like. And she couldn™t do nothing 
for me . You know, it was all one way, though she tr
ied. She did the dishes, and she just tried. 
She loved me and she tried so hard, poor thing.And then in Auschwitz, we  were together. And 

the c™est l™appel you had to
 lined out with five -- five wome n 
to the count, and the five wome n 
slept together, sort of in one row. So there wa
s myself, my sis t er and three other wome n. And we 
sort of hung out together, and that was it. Then I 
became ill. I developed -- really, I got sick with 
typhoid fe-fever. You know, fever and diarrhea and 
all of that, and I had no choice but report to 
the hospital, which was another te
rrible thing, because we hear te
rrible things what happens in 
the hospital. But I had no choice, so I went to
 the hospital. My sister
 stayed. And i-in the 
hospital, I ended up on the ward, the infectious
 disease ward. And we had a wonderful woma n 
pediatrician that was from tow
n, Dr. Greenberg, and her daughter
 was there, too. And she was a 
wonderful physician and treated us we ll. Every day or every other day, Mengele would come  and 

segregate people that he thought shou
ld die already. So we had visits 
to -- of that sort. And then 
one day -- then it was one room, and there was 
the other room, and be
tween the rooms were 
knocked out, you know, a knocked out hall that you 
could look into the other room. And I found 
out that my sister is there. You know, she got 
ill, too, and came . And so I could communicate, 
and we communicated. Twenty-sixth of September it
 was her birthday, so I ma de her a present, I 
saved up some  bread, and some  sausage, and 
gave her the happy birthday sandwich. Not only 
that, in Auschwitz, before I became ill, and when
 I star ted to be not feeling well, our role 
changed. She took care -- was taking care of
 me  and doing everything for me , and being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
116 
 
thoughtful and caring. It was just 
a different sister I had. For the first time in my life she was 
taking care of me . I neededher help. And it was so great. 
But short-lived, you know, so we 
ended up in the hospital. 
Q: Right. 

A: Then one day we hear -- oh, and then it was -- they -- me dically they treated us very well. 

Isolated, with the -- was a -- they were examin
ing every day the stool, 
etcetera, and blood, so 
they know when people were well, and when they 
got well they were sent out back to the ma in 
camp. And one day I was told that I am well, th
at her examination came negative and I can go 
back. And I told that to my sister, and she sa
ys, ﬁSo go back.ﬂ So I said, ﬁNo, I will wait for 

you.ﬂ ﬁOh, what are you doing, that™s dangero
us, you know. You ma y ge t killed.ﬂ Cause 
periodically they were cleansing the hospital to 
the -- to the gas chambers. So she says, ﬁWell, 
you know, they ma y catch you.ﬂ I say, ﬁI don™t care, 
you know, I don™t want to be separate from 
you. So I wait and then we™ll go together.ﬂ And then 
in couple days we hear rumors that they are 
going to liquidate the infectious disease hospita
l. And true enough, one day the trucks come , and 
I could see it through the window, and they are go
ing to do that, okay?  So we hear the s -- SS 

me n comi ng in, and we were sort of in the mi
ddle, so they come  there and the hole -- now we 
could communicated -- communicate w
ith my sister through the hole, 
but there was no way that I 
could come  to her -- her room, or she coul
d come  to my room. There was -- there was no 

possibility. They had sentry watching. So she a
nd I talked, and she says, ﬁ What are we  going to 
do? ﬂ I say, ﬁDorka, I don™t know wh
at to do, do you? ﬂ ﬁNo, what are 
we going to do? ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁ Well, I cannot come  to your room s o we c
ould be together and go wherever together, you 

cannot come here, so I really
 don™t know.ﬂ I suppose we could not cry even, you know, it was 
beyond crying. Then I hear steps and the sentries 
comi ng to our room, a nd saying to la -- for us 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
117 
 
to line up, so people start lining up. 
And I just wa s not eager to line 
up up front, so I was sort of 
holding back and watching. And people started to 
leave the room. And towa
rds the end I see two 
girls are jumping under the -- the be
ds, you know, the -- what you call it? 
Q: Bunk beds? 
A: Bunk bed -- beds. And I say, wow, not a bad 
idea. So people are leaving and I am holding 
back. And I start jumping under -- on the othe
r end, under the bunk. We ll -- 
and those two start 
crying, don™t do that, you will give  us out, they will ki ll us because of you. Needless to say I did 

not listen to that, and I stayed
 under one bunk bed, and that was it.
 And of course, I hear then, 
you know, they go to the next room where my si st
er is, and the room gets emptied, and I could 

see through the window, there was a window, the truc
k is waiting there, 
and they climb naked 
into the truck. Hours pass, and it gets dark, and 
two SS me n come  in the room with lantern and 
dogs and start, you know, looking. Ser -- search 
light under the bunk beds, 
and did not find us. 
And they leave, and we still there, under,you know, waiting couple hours 
or so until it was 
totally quiet. The buses were -- have left, and we 
started to talk with ea
ch other and say well, 
ma ybe it™s time  to get out and see what™s -- wh
at™s happening. So we get out and go up front, 

through a big hole, nurse™s stations. 
And we find out that a number of
 people are left. First of all, 
some people not from the infectio
us disease division. Some  doctor
s, women doctors, and we join 
the group. And then, I don™t know how long we
 waited, but we were put on a train and 
transported, we didn™t know where to, but it wasa benign atmosphere. We  were transported to 

Birkenau to the old -- to the camp from which 
we  originally came . And that camp was leaving 

next morning in trains, to go who knows where --
 to a camp, to another camp, you know, so who 
knows, and who has to believe that. And indeed we 
-- we left, still not knowing, still full of fear, 
what will be in the train, gas 
in the train, the -- you know, this
 in the train. And we were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
118 
 
transported to a camp in -- in a forest. It was 
Silesia, the German Silesia. You know, Auschwitz 
is in Silesi a, the Polish Silesia, 
and more left  is the German Silesi
a, but still Silesi a in the forest 
and outl -- unloaded in woods. Forest, pine forest. 
And -- and led to -- to te
nts. In each tent there 
were eight wome n or so. The be
dding was pine branches, and the 
cover was pine branches a-and 
-- and hay. And that where we lived from th
en on, for the next couple months. Digging -- 
didding -- digging ditches -- 
Q: Ditches. 

A: -- against tanks, Russian camp -- tanks that we
re -- that were a -- comi ng soon. So that was 

our -- and it was November, December. 

Q: So it was hard to dig? 

A: With hardly any clothes on us, o-on -- on our backs. 

Q: We  have to change the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: C-Can I ask you something about Auschwitz 
for just a second?  Be
cause it™s -- unless I 
mi sheard you, you said that you were taken from the hospital back to Birkenau. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So does that mean the hospital you were in 
was not in Birkenau?  You were in Auschwitz one? 
A: No, no. I -- 

Q: Or you were in anot
her part of Birkenau? 
A: Another part of Birkenau. 

Q: Okay. And did they take you ba
y truck back to your barracks?  Is
 that what they did?  Or you 
don™t remember? 

A: I reme mb er it being on the train. So ma ybe
 it was Auschwitz, you know, the real Auschwitz 
camp, not Birkenau, but it was a di stance. The hospital was a distance from the Birkenau 

barracks. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So they were taking us 
back to the barrack parts. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then we had to walk a bit and go to the barracks.  

Q: Do you reme mber wh
at barrack it was? 
A: Number? No, I don™t. 

Q: Do you reme mber whether it was on the far right, 
where the -- they used 
to call Mexico, or -- 
A: I don™t reme mber Mexico. 

Q: -- you don™t reme mbe r  the ba -- 

A: Mm- mm.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
120 
 
Q: You didn™t say, but I™m assumi
ng that your sister was taken. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: She was. And that was --  

A: The end. 

Q: -- that was the end. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So you were not able
 to say good-bye, nothing? 
A: We ll, that I think was the worst day 
in my whole experience about Auschwitz. 
Q: Wa s that. 

A: Wa s that. That day. That al
waysin my mi nd, you saved your 
life, but you could not save your 
sister. 

Q: Even though you know that you couldn™t have saved her. 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: It still -- and it™s the same
 with your parents, in your head. 
A: Stronger. 
Q: Stronger? 

A: Yes. 

Q: That you some how shoul
d have been able -- 
A: Yes. Cause in a symbolic way, my mother in 
Auschwitz, gave me  the job to take care of my 
sister. And the symbolic way was that before we 
entered -- before we were parted, she gave me  a 
little ha ndkerchief with fe w jewelry pieces, he r 
pi eces, few ri -- you know, that was not much to 
talk about, but few rings, and a necklace of hers. 
And she gave it to me, and says -- she said, take 
care.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
121 
 
Q: You™re not over it yet. I 
guess there™s no getting over it
. So I can™t say anything. 
A: Hm?  
Q: I can™t say anything. I can™t ta
ke it away. I™d like to take it 
away from you. But you also feel 
as if you™re responsible 
for your parent™s deaths. 
A: Yes. But especially for my sister, because of 
that exchange . And then later I was not so clear, 
but later I said, well she kid not -- could not mean
 the few pieces of gold, she meant my sister, to 
take care of. 

Q: Care of. Not to take care of these, yeah. Did 
you still have a desire to
 live in spite of that?  
When you went to this new camp, when you -- when you would say to me  in -- in -- in Lódz, 

though we didn™t know the words, we were going 
to overcome, we were going to survive. Did 
you feel that, or were you -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You did? 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: You still felt that? 

A: Yes. Wh y give in? 

Q: Right. 

A: To who m? 

Q: Right. To yourself.  

A: The Germans, to give in and let them kill me? Take my life, too? That was a different 

message -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- than -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
122 
 
Q: Right.  
A: I live and they died, and I shouldn
™t live. And that™s a different -- 
Q: Different me ssage. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And it™s not in
congruous, it™s -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- experience at the same ti me. 

Q: Yeah. So you™re in this sub
camp of Auschwitz in Silesia -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- with part of the people who were th
e st aff of the hospital, is that true? 
A: Oh, I don™t know, then we got mi xed up, to
tally, so it -- it was 
a different story.  
Q: Uh-huh, I see. Did you know any of these people?   
A: I knew a few people. 
Q: You knew a few. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So -- 

A: From wa y back, you know, those Lódz people --  

Q: Right. 

A: So I knew some  -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A:  - -  t h e  pe opl e . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
123 
 
Q: How bad was it in the subcamp?  Was it really
 -- was it worse than Auschwitz, or did you now 
know they™re not going to gas me ?   
A: I didn™t know anything. They
 can take their wa y any place, anytime, so that was not 
unfinished story.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: But how was it?  It was very co
ld, standing in the cold with hard
ly any clothes, digging ditches 
with very little to eat, and then 
comi ng to this tent. There was se
ntry, there was a little stove, a 
little -- you know oven, that gave a 
little hit -- and heat, and we
 could dry ma ybe some  clothing, 
socks -- we didn™t have socks -- you know, on th
e oven, and then go to sleep. The air was good, 
though cold. And we huddled together, and we slep
t and we went up and we were up day in, day 
out. And in short time  there was something very 
much that lifted our mood. And that was more 
often we heard airplanes buzzi
ng overhead, and we saw at the same  time the German commander 
and his helper looking up and crying. 
Q: Crying?  
A: Mm-hm. Those me n - -  those we
re not German airplanes, right? 
Q: Right. 

A: You guess who it was. 

Q: Russians. 

A: Sure. And we were laughing. I-I mea
n, we didn™t laugh in their face, right? 
Q: Right. So i-in your view, some
thing was going to happen quickly. 
A: Right. 

Q: Did it? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
124 
 
Q: Oh. 
A: But before that, let me  tell you one thing, in
 the barracks in Auschwitz
. We had a -- we heard 
a number of times airplanes above our head, an
d we could go out and see the airplanes flying 
very low. Those were not Russians, those were Am
erican planes. With insigna -- insignias, U.S., 
etcetera, etcetera. And we are 
in the barrack, and praying in
 unison, drop a bomb on us. Why 
don™t you drop a bomb?  

Q: On you. 

A: On the barrack. 

Q: Right. 

A: At least -- 

Q: But then you™d be killed. 

A: Yes.  

Q: It didn™t ma tter. 
A: Didn™t matter. Do some thing. Some body do s o
me thing. Drop a bomb on the railway. But at 
that point we  were praying drop 
a bomb, just don™t be so sadis
tic and watch us and do nothing. 
Those were American planes.  
Q: We re you -- you left in October to go to this --
 this subcamp in Silesi
a, I think. Am I right? 
A: Something like that, yes. 

Q: Do you reme mber whether the uprising in Ausc
hwitz had taken place, or you went to this 
camp before ?   

A: I -- we heard about it, but fr
ankly I don™t reme mber much about it, and I -- I must have known 
more, but I don™t reme mber what I knew. 

Q: You ma y not have been there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
125 
 
A: I -- I mi ght have b
een in the hospital. 
Q: Right. Okay. So were you 
angry at the Americans? 
A: And how. 

Q: Yeah. You still are. 

A: I™m still. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Of course I still am. More so later, b
ecause you know there is hi stor y now. There were 
people, particularly one Polish ar
istocrat, I forget his name , that
 went to Warsaw ghetto and saw 
what™s going on, and he went to Wa shington to 
talk to Roosevelt and to London and tell them 
what™s going on in Wa r saw ghetto, and they
 wou -- didn™t wa nt to believe him.  
Q: Karski. 

A: Karski, right. 

Q: The courier. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Mm. That was [indecipherable] 

A: That what confirme d the airplane s 
going above our heads and doing nothing. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: What cynicism. And Roosevelt 
saying we -- first we have to fi
nish the war, then we™ll think 
about the Jews.  

Q: Nothing much has changed, has it? 

A: No.  

Q: Mm. Do you escape fr om this camp in Silesia? 

A: Escaped from the route. I told you how 
the rou -- how the Germans reacted to the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
126 
 
Q: Mm. 
A: -- sight of planes, and probabl
y to the news that they were 
getting through the radio and so on. 
You know, they knew more than just the planes
, they knew the army -- the Russians are comi ng. 
Q: Right. 

A: So one day we get the order to get ready to 
march. We  going to the west. And then when the 
Death March, so-called Death March star
ted -- you know about that, right? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Evacuating the camps to the west. So we got 
ready to the March. What -- how should we get 
ready, w-we had nothing. 

Q: Nothing to pack, huh? 

A: Nothing to pack and nothing to worry about, 
who to li -- leave behi-b
ehind or not. And the -- 
they had a good number of Ger m
an women, SS women, and they pa
cked their things, and they 
went into the wagon, a big wagon, the wome n. And they
 -- we, the -- the slaves, had to pull that 
wagon with the -- those German ma dams sitting ther
e, taking turns, and that was a added bonus 
for the Death March. So we were going and goi
ng and going, and where are we going?  We  

didn™t know where we going. You know what ha
ppened, the Death March ended in Bergen-
Belsen, right, on the west border. We  didn™t da re s -- to slow down, because if you slowed down, 

you were dead. You know, the -- you know, they 
shoot the wome n, many wome n wer e  shot on 
the way. 

Q: Right. 

A: So you have to use all your strength to go. And on the third day I said I -- wherever we going 

I won™t make it because I am tota
lly exhausted. And that night we 
were finished at a far m, at a 
big farm, and slept over, on the ground of course, 
under cover. And th -- in that farm there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
127 
 
in -- under a shed, there were three big kettles 
of molasses. They were ma king molasses, okay?  
Hungry as we were, you know what we did. We  
threw us -- ourselves on the molasses and ate 
the molasses and you know what happene
d later. Diarrhea and vomiting.  
Q: Oh my gosh. 

A: And I wake up, and I said, which way do I want 
to die. I ha ve to find a way, because I am not 
ma king it. So at that time I was talking with 
a friend of mi ne, you know, a 
neighbor on my street 
from before the war, and in the same  class,
 graduating from Rumkowski™s high school. And she 
too said, well, we have to think about some thing. 
So we started to think and work together. And 
what we were observing is that we are going 
through one village after 
another with a very 
narrow village street -- road, re
ally, and that the houses beyond 
the fence looked empty, and we 
don™t see any people there. You know, one village af
ter another. So the conclusion wa s that they 
eva -- they evacuated the Germans earlier, wherev
er. So we thought, well, it will be easy enough 
to get to one of the houses if 
we think about it. And that™s one way, taking a chance. If Ger mans 
are there, we  are dead. If we ma rch we are dead
, so what do you have to lose?  So we picked a 
time where the sentries were not in the -- at th
e pl ace that we were close by, but you know, it was 
a very long line of wome n ma
rching. Started with a thousa
nd wome n and shrinking. So the 
sentries were sort of spaced, so we thought, well, 
that™s time . And we just didn™t have to go far to 

the right, we were ma rching that way, houses 
were here. And we opened the door -- you know, 

the -- undone the door, and we go in. And then, on th
e left hand side was a barn, so we  go around 
the barn and get into the barn and jump into
 the stack of hay, a
nd stay quietly there. 
Q: Inside the hay. 

A: Inside the hay. And we hear
d the ma rch going on, and in not 
too long time, it was quiet, so 
they passed. So we waited longer, longer, til it
 cleared, til it was to -- completely quiet and got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
128 
 
dark. And started to listen what™s going on on this
 side. And we heard voices. We  heard voices, 
and we heard a language -- a Slavic
 language but could not
 distinguish. It was not Polish, but we 
knew that i-in Germany t here were ma ny work
ers -- farm workers taken from Russia, from 
Ukrainia, fro m Belarus. So that all could be th
ere. So after we got some  reasonably time , we 
said, oh we have to go and see who is there. So
 we went and opened th
e door, and say hello, and 
happy to see you, and there were few wome n an
d few me n s itting around. And they don™t look 
very favorably at us. And they say -- they -- 
they didn™t say anything, 
they knew who we are. 
Shaved heads, you know, schmates on us. So we sa
y, yes we just run away from the -- from the 
ma rch, and we ask for help, kindly. You are Jews
. Get out of here. Okay. There was no way to 
discuss an answer like that comi ng from the group. 
So we left, and we were in the -- you know, 
on the outside again, and what to 
do? Well -- and they also said th
er e ar e Germans in the village, 
and they will catch you. So we thought they ma y 
be right, they don™t have to be right. Our 
thinking was clear, you know, in a
ll that, the thinking was clear.
 So we look around, and started 
to explore slowly. And what we see on the street
 in the mi ddle of the road, ma ny dead German 
soldiers, okay, with guts spilling 
out, and -- there was a fight, ther
e was a battle, and left the 
Germans be hind, so they are -- the Russians are 
probably advanced beyond that village. That 
would be then to the east, a
nd the Russians would be going west
. So finally we see a house on a 
little hill, so we go out there. We ™re looking now 
for shelter. And we see the door is locked, but 
the key is hanging on the left hi -- side of the 
door. The fa mily left the key so when they come  

back they open the door again, okay? Evacuees. 
So we opened the door and farn -- found a well 
supplied household, and food and wood and coal, you 
know, to heat and to eat and get sick from 
overeating. And we ma de ourself 
at home  there. And y -- cure
d our stomach eventually by, you 
know, getting to some  normal eating. And then what do we do?  It™s quiet, nobody moves. The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
129 
 
next few days we were explore the village sl
owly, seeing if some body is  there or not, and we 
didn™t find anybody so we were just, you know, nur
sing ourselves. It was warm and clean, and 
clean linen, and clean clothing, 
it was paradise. A Ger man paradise. We  can laugh now, huh? 
Q: Yeah.  
A: So we say w-w-what™s happening?  And 
one night we hear ma rchers, you know, thump, 
thump on the road. We  could oversee the road, the ma in road, east west, and we say who -- it™s a 

army we hea r , who can it be?  Either German
s or Russians. We didn™t dare to move, but 

eventually we say we have to see who it is. 
So we were slowly walking down that hill and 

looking and trying to find who th
ey are, and what we saw was a lot of white. A lot of white 
horses, white, little horses. Soldiers on the hor
ses are ma rching in white, and white hats and 
white fur. I say, well it looks like Si beria, you kn
ow, snow. So that -- perhaps they are Russian. 
So we go closer, eventually, and then we ha
d no doubt they are Russians, you know?  Because -- 

indeed, you know, the white hats and white thing 
and white horses. Everything to camouflage in 
Siberia, but that was winter, so 
that served everywhere in that 
part of Europe. And we see, you 
know, officers on horses along the ma rchers and we 
say, well, let™s take a chance, let™s go and 

talk to the officers. So we approach couple offi
cers and we threw ourself in their arms and say, 
thank God, you are saving us, you know that?  Well, th
ey were glad to hear that, you know. They 
-- you know. So -- and we felt perfectly safe. 
So we asked, where you going?  Na Berlin. 
Q: Ah. 

A: Okay. So I say, so what will be with us, ar
en™t you going to stay here
?  And -- we were naïve. 
And then they say no, we have to go -- we go to ge
t Berlin, to free Berlin, and in couple days in a 
different un -- different units will come here to 
stay, to -- the occupation army. So wait, they will 
come . Well, we were jubilant, you understand, righ
t?  Our saviors are just here. Two, three days 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
130 
 
pass, and then we see a bunch of young wome n ma rc
hing in the direction of our house, because 
our house was lit. And as they come  closer, we s
ee those are our friends, t
hose are the girls from 
Auschwitz. We know them. But they look -- they di
dn™t look the same . So they come closer, and 
we say, what happened to you?  And they say, we
ll, we were raped by the Russian army. And 
they are comi ng here, too. They were much mo
r e  east, so you know, the Russians encountered 
them. Wow. They didn™t want to stay, they want
ed to go forwards, I don™t
 know -- they had their 
plans how to go. And then is what are we going to do?  We  -- 
Q: Never st -- never stops, right? 

A: Never stops.  

Q: Right. 

A: We  were forewarned, that™s true. So, in a
nother few days, and the army is ma rching again, 
and few officers are comi ng our way, every one with
 a bottle of whiskey in their hands. And they 
oh, they hug us, my -- my was lublu. We love
 you. Let™s have a part
y. So we -- w-we knew 
already, but we are forewarned. We  prepared 
a bundle to run away beforehand. And then we 
said, you know, come  to the living room and sit 
down and they didn™t need e-encouragement or 
more invitation, so they came and sat down, and we
 said, my was lublu, too, but we will join you 
in few mi nutes, just be patient. And we -- 

Q: Could you speak Russian?  Some  Russian, no? 

A: You could -- few words in Polish, you know, 
so y-you could ma ke yourself understandable. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we go and grab our bundles and go the 
back door to the road. And the Russians are 
ma rching, you know, those were hu-huma ngous armi
es, you know?  They are ma rching and we 

ask them, where is your headquarters?
 So they told us, more e a st -- no, mo re west, and they were

going, too. As you know they going now Berlin. So 
we [indecipherable] -- 
no, actually they said, 
they -- the headquarters were most -- more east 
from they were comi ng. So they go west, we go 
east, and after awhile, we -- we chance upon th
e -- a small house that wa -- you know, a -- a 
cottage, really, German cottage, and the headquarters.
 And we ask to be led to the chief, to the 
commander, and we tell the comman
der the story, where we from, 
and that we want -- we are on 
our way back home  to Poland, Lódz, and would he
 -- and the danger of his soldiers, being raped, 
etcetera, would he help us to get -- get back hom
e?  And he says yes, we™ll help you. And he says 
go to the kitchen, th-there are our wome n work
ing, you join them, and -- and you can stay here. 
So another chapter started. We  were with the gi
rls, the Russian girls in the kitchen, peeling 
potatoes, doing other things, and wa
s fun. They are -- they were very friendly, they were singing 
all the time . And that part was fine. And we pel 
-- felt pretty safe. We sl
ept -- so during the day 
we were in the kitchen. At night 
-- it was the front line. From there, soldiers were going to the 
front for the day, at night they came back to sl
eep. They were eating dinner in the dining room, 
and then they were sleeping on the floor, and we 
were sleek -- sleeping 
on the tabl es in the 
dining room. And it was pretty safe. It was -- it wa s good. 
Q: It™s safer than being in the hay. 

A: Much. 

Q: Much safer. We  have to change the tape.

Q: Paula, would you have consider
ed that liberation?  When you we
re with these -- the Russians, 
and you™re sleeping on the tables, and the Russian
 soldiers are sleeping on the floor, I mean, 
were you then free? 

A: We are on the way home. 

Q: On the way home. So you™re going east. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: You™re going towards Lódz. 

A: Towards Lódz. W -- our road to -- was to go west. 

Q: Right. 

A: No, east. 

Q: East.  

A: East, yes, mm-hm.  
Q: But are you -- do you consider yourself li
berated from the Germans cause there are no 
Germans any more? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So is there a -- a mo ment 
of -- you know, liberation is a ve
ry funny word, and I never un -- I 
never know when -- is there really
 a mome nt when you f
eel free?  It doesn™t s -- it seems a little 
impossible. It seems as if it™s a -- a process as opposed to a mo me nt.  

A: I think it™s a process, and we were on the way. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
133 
 
A: And don™t forget, we were on the front. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Right?  The Russians were figh
ting to go -- they were going west
, and they were fighting their 
way -- na Berlin, the goal was Berlin. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: They were -- they were far fr om Berlin still. 

Q: Uh-huh. Right, right. 

A: So -- and there was no way of knowing if 
the Germans won™t get back. You know, they could 

conquer -- a-and that what happened in that wa
r. They were -- you know, they were not giving 
up easily.  

Q: Right. 

A: Was the western armies or -- 
or the Russian armi es. So we 
-- we knew that there is a big 
strength that -- 
of -- of the -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- Germans. But they were, you know, the Russi
ans were fight it -- figh
ting. And listening to 
their mood - -  na Berlin and, the army™s going 
na Berlin, ah, we are fighting with them. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know?  It™s happening. It™s a turnaround. So 
we were just jubilous together with the -- 
with them.  

Q: Right. 

A: On the other hand, we knew that every morni
ng troops we re going out to the front that was 
not far away. We  -- we heard fightings, you know th
e shelling of each other, all day, and then the 
soldiers came dead me  -- you know, tired, home to the base, which was a small house, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
134 
 
were, you know, eating dinner, and --
 and then conking out on the 
floor, going to sleep. So it was 
in the center of the war. 
Q: Right. What -- how wa s your being Jewish trea
ted?  Did they care? We re they sympathetic, 
were they -- they di -- or what -- 

A: No, we were so happy, so when we were sitting with the soldiers and eating dinner, they ask 

us about -- and a -- as I tol -- told you, be
tween Polish and Russian we could understand each 
other, with di fficulties, but we could ma ke ourself understood, and they ask about us, where we 

come  from, who we are. So we were telling we 
are Jewish, we come  from
 Auschwitz, and we are 
ready to go home , thank you. And then one day, af
ter a few days of such liberal talks, two 

officers approached us, me  and Vonda, and they
 introduced themselves, and they say, we are 
Jewish. And we -- we -- we hear what you saying 
to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling 
them that you are Jewish. They don™t know we ar e Jewish. They hate Jews. So don™t tell them 

who you are. We  will help you. Wo w, that was a slap
 in the face. You know, 
to the liberators we 
cannot say we are Jewish. But thos
e were astute officers, and th
ey were Jews, and they -- we 
sensed that they know very well what they are 
talking about. And we we
re not surprised then. 
Q: Right. 

A: So what™s new?   

Q: Right. It™s the same  story. 

A: You know?  Hm?  

Q: Sa me  story. 

A: Sa me  story. So that wa s that. 

Q: So no mo re talk about who you are? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
135 
 
Q: And how did they help you, these officers? 
A: Oh, they were just keeping an eye on us fo
r safety and so on. So just was good to know that 
we have some comr ade s here th
at know what™s cooking, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- share with us, so that 
was a good feeling. Fr iendship. 

Q: Right. 

A: This kind of a -- 

Q: So did you stay with that group for awhile? 

A: We stay there for awhile, and they are promisi
ng us that they -- they are working on set -- on 
putting a train together that will go from that poi
nt to south Poland. And when the train is ready, 
we are free to go. And it did not take very long. Th
ey told us, and they drove us to the station 
when the train was set. And we took a 
train and arrived in Lódz one day. 

Q: And you went back to Lódz because you t
hought what?  You thought your father would 
come ?  Did you think anyone would be there? 

A: We didn™t think. 

Q: You didn't think. 

A: We  were just wanting to go home. 

Q: Right. 

A: Knowing that there™s nobody, you 
know. I didn™t have illusion that  Mother will be there, or 
Father, or my sister. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But that™s home. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
136 
 
A: That™s all I knew about home. M y city.  
Q: And whe n you got there, a lot of
 survivors had come  back, yes? 
A: Not a lot, but some. 

Q: But survivors from ot her circumstances came,
 not just from Lódz. Am I correct, or not? 
A: We ll, first of all, there were the remnants of
 Jews in Lódz that stayed, you know, because of 
they were needed to clean up -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- the -- the -- the qua
rter, and they were comi ng out of their holes now, you know, openly. So 
they were there, and they were pre -- in pretty good shape, I ha
ve to tell you know, you know?  
They probably -- they could not 
stop thanking God for what happened, that they were allowed -- 

you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that their things we re so different from
 others. There were people that comi ng from the 
camps, very few. And for a long time, weeks, we 
sort of saw that that™s
 it, nobody else survived. 
Q: Ah, out of the whole -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- Europe. 

A: That -- that that  is -- that is all. So we tried 
to -- to live. We  got assigned a apartme nt, and that 
was an apartment that Germans were living in and 
then they evacuated, they -- they went west, to 

Germany. So we had an apartment. We had no 
job, there were no jobs to be had, we had no 
money. The Jewish Committee that 
was trying to for m itself was very weak and inefficient. And 
there was not much help that they could give 
us, me , my friend and some  others. So life was 
very, very hard. And what do we do? We  wanted 
to enroll at school, at 
the university. Lódz did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
137 
 
not have a university before the war. It was ope
ning, and they had a me dical faculty. So that was 
not possible to get to that, so 
I enrolled in natu
ral sciences, and tried to go to school, which was 
very hard to do, you know, we were not there, 
mentally. So life was hard and there was a 
question how do we survive. 

Q: And you were together with your friend. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wa nda -- Vonda? 

A: Vonda. 

Q: Wanda?  

A: Yes. How do we survive?  Then there were th
e opportunities to ma ke sa -- a living, where for 
me n, following, you know, after a war, and the war wa
s not finish really, but Russians were in 
Lódz so it wa s a city occupied. Usually it is 
-- people live from black ma r ket, you know, 
exchanging -- exchanging dollars, zlotys and so 
on. And a big thing was ba -- bringing food stuff 
to the west, to the German border, and exchangi
ng it for other things li
ke linen and so on, and 
then comi ng to Poland and se-selling linen fo
r money and living on that. The only thing that 
there was a different between a 
-- me n and women, me n were very comf ortable doing it. As a 
woma n you had to be prepared to get raped on 
the way. That was the 
-- the law of post-war 
without org -- or-order, without poli
ce, without anything. You know, you -- 
Q: Rape w -- rape was common?  

A: Absolutely. You had to count on that. And so
me women didn™t mi nd, or 
got used to that, and 
we didn't wa nt to do that, so we were like that
. Then come s along a friend of Vonda™s, whom she 
knew from ghetto. And she introduced me  to him,
 and that was my future husband. And pe -- ex-
husband. And it was a typical stor
y of a woma n t hat cannot support herself, poor thing, so she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
138 
 
has to have a ma n who does. Is not rich, but 
he came also, you know, fr om Auschwi t z, but he 
went to his little town close to Lódz, and his 
parents had a little factor
y of producing oil from 
grain. And he started this fact
ory and he was ma ki ng money. No
t much, but enough to be very, 
effusively generous with us, helping us with br
ead and butter. And from little to little, you know, 
I was caught in that gratefulness. Had sex, and 
once I had sex, my Ma ma  told me , that™s your 
husband.  
Q: Really? 

A: You ma rry him.  

Q: Period. 

A: My mother was dead, but that I 
imagined what Mother would say. 
Q: She never said that to you, but you imagined -- 

A: You had to be a virgin -- 

Q: Uh-huh, right.  
A: -- when you married. 
Q: Right. 

A: And the Jewish law was when you ma rry -- 
when you have sex, you -- 
you are ma rried, if you 
didn™t know it. 

Q: It™s not a great -- 
no, I didn™t know this.  
A: I™m telling you. 

Q: It™s a good thing. 

A: I wish I would be so smart. So yeah, that 
was a terrible thing, because from the day one, I 
didn™t think he™s a -- you know, he 
is a partner for me . But I was gr
ateful, that™s true and that™s 
fine. But wi -- I was [indecipherable] myself, feeling obliged by Je
wish law to be his partner. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
139 
 
Q: We re you attracted to him?  
A: Not really. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But it was a question of loneliness, of no f
ood, of having sex. And I was not a femist -- 
fe mi nist then, free of my mother™s beliefs a
bout sex and ma rriage go together like a dove and 
carriage, yes?  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You need to go farther, I guess. 

A: That™s right, and leave that, a
nd go on. That what I should have -- 
Q: What was he like?  When you say you -- you knew in
stinct -- that he really
 wasn™t going to be 
a partner, so was he not an intelle
ctual, was he not a sensitive -- 
A: Totally unintellect ually. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Totally insensitive. Totally -- good heart he
 had, you know, in part, you know, to help Vonda 
and me , and that was of his good heart. He hel -- 
opened his house in that
 little town to some  
relatives, they were comi ng also, from everyw
here. And feeding them, and giving them sleep, 
etcetera, so he was good in that way, and warm. 
But nothing else. Not a ma n to -- man to talk 
with, to discuss things, and y-you 
know, that™s -- that was a big mi ss,
 and I was just poor little 
girl needing some body t o take care of her. I wa
s not raised for that, but that™s how it felt. 
Q: Did -- did Vonda say to you, what are you doing? 

A: Vonda was ma rried in ghetto to a guy, and he came back from war -- 

Q: Oh. 

A: -- at that same  ti me , so she was -- 

Q: She was set. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
140 
 
A: She was set.  
Q: She -- 

A: She told me  not to marry him, but I wa
s not ready to listen. I knew myself that 
[indecipherable] don™t, but I did anyhow. 

Q: Right. 

A: [indecipherable] of be
ing alone, lonely, unhappy, abandoned by the world, by everybody. 
Poor thing. And he gives me  shelter. 

Q: Sure, ma kes sense. 

A: Right. 

Q: Probably happened a -- 

A: But I didn™t have to pay the price for it. 

Q: We ll, no, I guess -- 

A: I didn™t. But I did. 
Q: But you did, yeah. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: But you didn™t know. Or you didn™t know how not to do it. 

A: I didn™t know how not to do that. 

Q: And I™m sure this is true, this is
 a very common kind of story, right? 
A: Aprow -- yes. It is the sort of mor a lity that 
enslaved wome n, that their sexuality is not theirs, 
but a ma n™s, and they have no say over it. 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s very hard to get away from it. 

Q: Absolutely.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
141 
 
A: We ™re still not, as wome n, out of t he woods, 
to comfortly -- comfor
tably to distinguish a 
relationship, sexuality, laws, et
cetera. Men have no problem. Me
n were doing it all the time. 
Q: Including during your time. 
A: Including during war time. 

Q: It™s not a new thing. 

A: Not a new thing. 

Q: Right.  

A: And we have a long way to go. 

Q: Yeah. How long did you stay in Poland toge
ther?  You -- so you -- when did you get ma rried, 

™46, ™47?  

A: ™46. 

Q: ™46.  

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: So, very soon after you came back. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Are you going to school when you got ma rri
ed?  Cause you starte
d school before?   
A: No, I enrolled in school before I was ma rried
, but then -- what happened then too, as I told 
you, I intended to stend -- stay in Poland becau
se I thought that™s my 
country, and you have no 
right to kick me  out, German or Pole -- or th
e Polacks. But what started then, if you don™t know, 
pogroms started in Poland, around in small towns, in
 Lódz Jews were killed. There we re famous 
killing in southern Poland, Kielce, where Jews 
we re killed for nothing. And it was frightful. You 
know, it was just a second ch-chapt er of killing Jews, but now from Polacks, which was not a big 

surprise. But after that war?  So there was a 
big exodus from Poland by Jews to Germa ny. Why 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
142 
 
Germany?  Because Germany was divided and 
occupied, you know, by the western powers and 
by Russia. And that was Germany, 
particularly American occupati
on that we were aimi ng for. 
Was a window out of Europe, and that was my re
solve. I have enough of 
that continent, I™m 
getting out. So that was -- we went to Ge
rmany, smuggled, of course, you know, through the 
border. It was a big exodus, ma ny people left. 
But in Germany, what happened?  The big powers 
organized DP camps, displaced people camps, in 
which they put Jews, and Jews were in those 

camps for five, six years, cause nobody wanted to 
give them a visa, okay?  So that was another 
eye opener, you know, where you going?  So I enro
lled in school, the university opened in 
Frankfurt [indecipherable] in me
dical faculty, and I enrolled, a
nd I could do it because German 
governme nt paid for tuition, it was the beginning 
of reparations for -- you know, for Jews after 
the war. It took me  five years, I started in Lódz, 
five years to get my diploma, and the visa came s 
at that time  too. So I was ready to 
go with my M.D. title, to America. 
Q: And your husb -- your husband, was he shocke
d that you were going to me dical school?  I 
mean, this was not ordinarily in the 40™s to 
-- for a woman -- maybe it was in Europe, I don™t 
know. Certainly wasn™t here. 

A: In Europe this was much more acceptabl e. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And in that way I should say I admi red hi m.
 He let me  do what I wanted. He let me  work, 
ma ke money and he took the money and gambled it away. He was a gambler. 

Q: Really? 

A: Mm-hm. So I was grateful. I could work. 

Q: You were gra -- but you c
ouldn™t have your own money. 
A: Of course not. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
143 
 
Q: So, you graduated with a me dical degree in wh
at?  What sort of me dical doctor were you at 
that time, after fi ve year s? 
A: Medical, general me dical. 

Q: Just general me d-me dical degree. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: So then, you came to this country in ™51? 

A: Right. And hi -- I had a son two years old. 

Q: So while you were finishing me dical school, you had a son? 

A: Right, David. 

Q: Wow, that™s a lot. 

A: Yes, I always did a lot. 

Q: You always did a lot. 

A: Don™t you get the feeling? 
Q: I get the feeling, yes. 
A: Oh, my. I  was capable, and I liked doing a lo
t. You know, I -- I had 
the energy to do -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and enjoying it, yes. 

Q: Yes. And did your husband 
help?  Was he good with David? 
A: Yes. [indecipherable]. But I -- I was so grat
eful to him that he -- you know, most husband 
didn™t like their wives to wo
rk or make money, right?  
Q: Right. 

A: Stay home, you know, that was the common cry. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
144 
 
A: And he was different, he let me  -- he help
ed me  studying, he took care of David. You know, i-
it was so nice.  
Q: We ll, you were also a way for him to have 
money so he could gamble, given what you said. 
A: Of course, of course. 

Q: Yes, h m.  

A: He trained me  so 
he can [indecipherable] 
Q: Where did you go in the United States when you came here? 

A: Cincinnati.  

Q: Why Cincinnati? 

A: Tell you why. The idea was, when the visa fi
nally came , through the Jewish institution HIAS, 
and you know, then there was a question where do
 I go. So they assigned you where to go. So 
my first assignme nt was Seattle, Wa s hington. 
You -- you won™t think I am
 so s mart any more 
after I tell you that story. What 
do I know about Seattle, Wa s hington? 
Q: I have no idea. 

A: I had nobody to talk to that kne
w anything. So I t
ook out the ma p. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I look, America, Seattle, ocean, Russia. 
I want you to know, when 
we left Europe, since 
the end of the war til we left , we lived in a 
constant fear that the Russia is going to overrun 
Europe, that they are not finished. So there wa
s always a fear that Russia will overrun. I was 
infected by that, too, stupidly. So there is Ru
ssia, and here is Seat
tle, a inch on the map. 
Q: So you really got afraid? 

A: Yes. Three -- we --  

Q: It™s too close. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
145 
 
A: Next door. 
Q: Right. 

A: I said, I don™t want to go 
there. Would you change, kindly. They changed. Next assignment 
came, El Pa so, Texas. I consult the ma p again. A
nd I look at the ma p and I see El Paso. It™s the 
end of the States. Mexico. Cowboy coun -- Texas.
 It™s cowboy country. And beforehand I told 
the guys at HIAS, one thing I won™t 
go to is New York or Chicago. 
Q: Really? 

A: Right. Cause that™s Al Capone country. 

Q: Both is Al Capone country? 

A: New Yor k had some thing else, but you know, 
those are -- you know, and I don™t wa nt to be 

there. I just want you to tell 
-- to know. Before the war, th
e idea of going to America was a 
horrible idea for most Jews. Only deserted of Russian army - -  

Q: Went to -- 
A: -- would go, or adventurers, or 
gamblers were going to America. 
Q: Oh. 

A: A nice girl like I would not go to America.
 So New York, and Chicago were the biggest 

centers of that. We ll, anyway, El Paso I told
 them, that™s cowboy country, and I-I don™t know 
about that. At that time friends of
 mine were already in Cincinna
ti, you know, with the same  past 
history. So we corresponded, and we -- I told th
em the story, and they said, why don™t you come  
to Cincinnati?  I said, how can I come to Cincin
nati, I am dependent on HIAS and all that. And 
they se -- nevermind, they will ship you to -- to New Orleans from -- from Ha mburg, and when 

you are in Ne w Orleans, we will ca
ll the leaders there, and they 
will ship you to Cincinnati. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
146 
 
that™s what happened. We were 
entering New Orleans, and then 
we correspond -- I me an, there 
were telephones and so on, and they put us 
on a train from New Or
leans to Cincinnati. 
Q: And did you have a job in a hospital, though?  
A: Oh, well, no. We  were just -- 

Q: You were just there. 

A: We  were just there, in Ci
ncinnati, no job. And he -- he go
t a job, finally. And you know the 
institutions, Jewish instituti
on were helpful in the beginni
ng, supportive, til he was ma king 
money. And that™s how we
 start our life here.  
Q: So when did you start your practice?   

A: I had to do my state board. 

Q: Right. Did you speak Englis
h?  I just thought of this. 
A: No. 

Q: Of course you didn™t.  
A: But I took one year English in school, as an additional foreign language. 
Q: When?Way back? 

A: In high school, way back. [indecipherable] 

Q: And that was enough? 

A: Then I learned, I worked and I learned. 

Q: And the me dical terms, of course, are the same . Or -- 

A: Different language. 

Q: Different la -- 

A: Or the -- the Latin was the same .  

Q: Latin™s the same. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
147 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Right. 

A: But different language.  

Q: So when did you pass your boards?   

A: I think ™55. We  ca me  in ™51, I did my internsh
ip and residency in -- in
 me dicine. I could not 
take the board before because they had a probl
em with recognizing certain schools in Germany 
as worthy of -- you know, to acknowledge the gra
duation. So it took them few years, and finally 
I got the news that your school is
 recognized. So I took the state board, and then I wa s a doctor.  
Q: Then you were a doctor? 

A: Yes.  

Q: We  have to change the tape.

A: Fa mily medicine. 

Q: Fa mily medicine. 

A: Mm-hm, yeah. 

Q: So when did you decide to be -- to do psychiatry? 

A: I was about, you know, close to 15 years in pract
ice, in family practice. And then I realized 
that I -- you know, I had a lot -- my practice was 
ma inly women -- wome n and children, very few 
me n. Fa mily, so the husband would come  and so
 on, but ma inly wome n. And I was taken aback 
by observing how ma ny wome n suffered from de pr
ession, deep depression. And that was a well-
to-do suburb of Cincinnati, where families were 
ma  -- ma inly comi ng to work with Cincinnati 
with General Motors, Ford company, PNG. So 
they were -- the husband were -- had good jobs. 
The wives were taking care of the house and chil
dren, and I would see them in my offic e , and 
they would come  with all ki
nds of physical symptoms . And we did the work and nothing 
showed. So I would have to tell them that I 
could not find anything el
se, so I don™t know why 
you -- why you hurt here and there. And try to so
rt of enlarge the ques
tioning, what and how. I 
was doing a lot of house calls, not because I was so
 generous, but ma ybe I wanted -- I was used 
to house calls back home . But I wanted to get to
 know the country I am living in, and that was a 
very good way to do it, to see people™s homes, and how they lived. So I know the ones -- one 

thing I knew that was very stressful, and that 
was the big comp anies were promoting people, but 
you paid a price for it. The promotion would come
 and you had to move  to another part of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
149 
 
country. If you get the promotion in Cincinnati, 
you would be sent to the 
west coast, and from 
the west coast you would be sent to
 Cincinnati. So the fami l y was 
always in a turmoil, having to 
live with the idea that every two years you have to
 move, if you want to move up the ladder. And 
it was the wife that had to put in roots quick
ly, school, church, neighborhood. I knew that that 
was a chore, but they were always sen -- saying that
 they are treated well-- they are treated well. 
The husband really didn™t move. He was stil
l in the circles of national commerce, or 
productivity. But the wife had to change to
tally her surrounding, and ma ke it easy for the 
husband. So I know -- knew that, but beyond that I 
didn™t know. And I had friends, they were 
either in training of psychiatry, 
or psychiatrists, and they told
 me  about it, and what -- and I 
didn™t know anything about Freudi
an psychiatry in Germany. We
 were learning psychiatry, you 
know, but not about Freud. So, you know, the dynami c 
psychiatry, it was fresh to me, and it was 
exciting, so I said, I ka -- 
I have to do it. That™s -- I went into training.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And that was very exciting, and 
that was good. Listen, I have to 
tell you part of my story that 
I omitted, and I ashame d of that. But it is very hard. And that -- I told you I had another son, 
right?  

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: I was -- when I came  to America, I was preg
nant -- you know, David was two years old and I 
was pregnant. And then Charlie 
was born in ™51, still the same 
year we came . And he was a 
lovely child, so I had two children, right, and fine
. He developed -- what can I say? He developed 
psychological problems, was in 
therapy. We  did not recognize 
the depth of his depression. 
Eventually he  committed suicide. He was 21. So th
at is a thing I don™t lik
e to talk about. You 
understand why. Big pain.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
150 
 
Q: Yeah. Is that also one of the reasons 
why you d -- wanted to go into psychotherapy? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: It was quite separate. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Course it™s painful, it™s horri
ble. And David is two years older? 
A: Two and a half y
ears older, mm-hm. 
Q: Should I ask you something?  I don™t -- I -- 

A: Yes, go ahead. 

Q: Did y -- did you understand und -- at
 any point before he died, 
how deep the depression was?  
How -- how -- how much in pain he wa
s, or was that too hard to tell? 
A: I knew some , but obviously I did 
not understand how deep it was.  
Q: Mm, mm. 

A: And how dangerous it was -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- to his life. 

Q: Yeah. Did David?  His so -- his brother. 

A: Neither. 

Q: Nobody. 

A: No. He was in therapy. 

Q: Right. 

A: But I don™t think the psyc
hiatrist understood it too.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
151 
 
Q: So it seems as if no one could have -- I mean, there were no -- there were not enough signs for 
some one -- and it™s not clear that one can do anything -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- under those circumstances. And why did 
you say you were ashame d?  You were ashame d 

because you didn™t sa y it. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Oh.  

A: If -- to -- as if to 
deny his existence, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: Which I don™t want to do -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but it is too hard to
 talk about it, so -- 

Q: And I mu st admit, I was hesitating to ask 
you. I knew. I didn™t know this -- I didn™t know any 
part of the story, but I was hesitating. So it™
s -- it™s very tough. When were you divorced? 
A: ™73. Charlie died in ™73, too.  

Q: Sure. Wo w. So that was quite a year. 

A: You can say that.  

Q: I don™t know, your life has these arcs of so ma
ny difficulties, and so -- and at the same  ti me , 
accomplishments. No? 

A: I don™t know, I don™t treat it as accomp
lishme nt. It was work that I had to do. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Work I had to do to survive the war in the 
ghetto, in Auschwitz. You 
know, to bear witness, 
which I am doing now.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
152 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Just to tell the story 
that it -- it really was.  
Q: And whe n did you start talking about the Ho
locaust?  Did you talk with your sons? I know you 
couldn™t talk with your husband, he -- he would not speak about any of his experiences.  

A: With my sons I ta
lked, but very little. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Facts, giving facts.  

Q: But they didn™t know your experience. 

A: No. 

Q: No.  

A: Certainly not in details how we ta
lk now. So the silence was horrible. 
Q: Did you want to speak? 

A: I could not speak. 
Q: You couldn™t. 
A: I could not speak. I could tell 
them some , but then I -- I -- 
I couldn™t go any farther. And 
people didn™t want to listen -- 

Q: I was going to ask, yeah. 

A: -- including my children. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So that was a sort of sile
nce over the whole experience.  
Q: Right. 

A: Individually, and as
 a Jewish experience. 
Q: So, the people that you me t in Ci
ncinnati didn™t say what happened? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
153 
 
A: There was a group of people, of Jews, that cam
e here at the same ti me, about the same time, 
with similar experiences. And I was involved 
with that group. One was the friend that, you 
know, asked me  to come , you know, from se -- 
from New Orleans here. Where it was by and 
large not a comfortable group, the same way as
 my relationship with my husband was not 
because he was not on my level, and we had very
 little in common in communicating and talking 
about things, and -- but that group wa s the same
 cut of people. We  were celebrating holidays 
together, we had parties like, you know, for holid
ays. The advantage of being part of the group 
was one. We knew about our experi
ences, and we didn™t have to talk about it, where we from. 
We all had the same  experience, and i-it was just
 being together, and not 
to have -- to explain 
yourself, or listen to explanation. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But then, at the same time that I was c
ontemplating moving away from my husband, my 

relationship with that group al
so broke off. And it  was funny 
and not funny how it did. You see, 
that group was strictly Polish Jews of tradition 
and Jewishness, and patr
iarchy, and the woma n is 
a woma n and I am the man. You know, in Jewish
 law, a woman cannot divorce a husband. The 
husband alwa ys can divorce the woman, to the degree 
that if there is not a 
rabbi, he can tell the 
woma n, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you, and th
at e-equals divorce, 
when you tell it to 
the rabbi. But a woma n cannot divorce a ma n. I 
didn™t un-understand that for a long time , but 
then, after I divorced my husband, that wo -- gro
up turned against me , they stopped talking to 
me. And I didn™t understand why til I became c -- became clear to me that I did do the 

unspeakable, I divorced a ma n. A woma n divorced 
a ma n. So I was not sorry about breaking off 

the relationship, but what ma de me  very
 angry wa s realized why it happened.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
154 
 
Q: Mm-hm. So is the -- the -- the next -- the ne
xt person with whom you a c tually talk about your 
experiences Lanzma nn?  Because that™s in the 
next  couple of years, right? Or is it -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And once you do that, once you give that interv
iew, do you decide, okay, now I don™t have to 
talk about it again?  Or not? 

A: I don™t know, but in the time since my divorce a
nd all that, I was more free to talk with my 
friends, ma ny of whom were Gentiles, wome n we got
 sort of all together 
with a group of wome n 
that we were sort of compatible
, and they are all Ge-Gentiles. A
nd I was free to talk with them 
about it, or even with other -- other Jews. But 
how it happened really, ma ybe the impetus was the 
interview with Lanzma nn. 

Q: Mm-hm. Have you spoken to students, or is th
is all very private? Or synagogue groups, or 
church groups, or -- 

A: No, no -- 
Q: No, no public -- 
A: -- I never wanted to do it. 

Q: -- no. You didn™t want to do it. 

A: No, no. I did once in a school, you know, in a public
 school to a group, to a class, talked about 
it, and that was very unsatisfactory. I 
didn't enjoy it, it was just not my -- 
Q: It wasn™t your cup of tea. 

A: Ye -- right. So I didn™t.  

Q: Do -- have people in the last 10 years, or 
m- ma ybe since the Lanzma nn film, do the y, when 
they meet you say -- ask you more questions? They don™t? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
155 
 
Q: I guess I™m surprised at that
. In the last 10 years?  Not -- 
A: Be-Because they saw the -- the film? 
Q: Because they saw the film, or in the last  10 years, I mean, the Holocaust Museum in 

Washington opened, and then there wa s ﬁSchindl
er™s List ﬂ and there seems to be more 
discussion about survivors, so I thought perhap
s there was more discussion with you as well?  
No. 

A: No.  

Q: But you s -- you said you -- when you were in 
the ghetto, that you felt you needed to bear 
witness, yes? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So how were you going to do that?  I mean, 
how did you, in your own head, think about ho -- 
the Lanzma nn was accidental, actually -- 

A: That™s right. 
Q: -- if you hadn™t gone up to him.  
A: I didn™t have it formulated eith
er in the ghetto, or -- or in 
Auschwitz to bear witness. But 
thought was, you have -- you have to 
live through, you have to survive,
 be able to talk about the 
pa -- because people won™t belie
ve if you don™t talk about it. 
Q: Right. 

A: They won™t believe those stor
ies. So some body has to tell how it was. And I didn™t have any 
concrete things to talk or wr
ite about it. But just to be a
live, and show them you didn™t -- you 
know, I was not killed, I was -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- almost done away 
with, but I am alive. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
156 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And that really happened. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was sort of more abst
ract by -- that was one way. 
Q: Right. 

A: To survive to tell the st ory. 
But very -- in a abstract way. 
Q: So do you talk more with David now, or his 
seeing the Lanzma nn interview ge -- it -- meant 
he didn™t have to ask you so ma ny questions be
cause you said so much i n that interview?   
A: It™s not that he asked questions, but he -- we 
watched it together, and he told me  how much he 
appreciate that, that we did it,
 and that I have done it.  
Q: Mm. 

A: So we had a more unspoken feelings -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- of understanding. 
Q: Right.  

A: Which is invaluable, really. 

Q: Absolutely. We ll, I have to say that the firs
t time  I spoke with you, you said to me , absolutely 
not, you™re not going to do an interview. And finally  the second time you said yes. So I just want 

to tell you how m -- I™m real
ly, terribly grateful that you said 
yes, and it™s been more than a 
pleasure for me  to be with you today. 

A: Thank you. And it™s very important that we did it. 

Q: Absolutely. 

A: I feel that™s another step to sort 
of clear my hea r t a
nd clear my brain. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
157 
 
Q: Does it do that? 
A: I thinks so. 

Q: Yeah?  I hope so. 

A: And also another thing. I think I told that 
to Ra ye, ma ybe to you, that the trip to Poland, you 
know, to Lódz, the 60
th
 anniversary that I participate in, shoo
k me  very much, to the degree that I 
was sorry I went. 

Q: Really? 

A: It really unsettled me  unbelievably. And I don™t 
have really all answers to that. One thing was 
that it was the feeling like bearing witness to be ther
e, established the fact th
at it really happened 
to me  and to my fa mily and to my pe ople. It™s sort
 of I put it to rest th
rough the years, and being 
there at the anniversary -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- it brought it, 
you know, physically -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- that it really did happen. And that was 
such a -- a reaction, physically and me ntally my 
whole body and -- was totally unsettled for mont hs now. 

Q: This was 2005 in the summer, yes?   

A: That™s right. 

Q: 2005, it was --  

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- so it was rece nt. 

A: August. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
158 
 
A: Yes, 60
th
 anniversary.  
Q: And it -- you™re st ill unsettled fr om it? 
A: I™m still unsettled fr om it.  

Q: Hm. So you™ve clashed with your -- the se
lf that put it behind, a
nd then it got brought 
forward, it -- and of course it™s physical becaus
e you™re in the very place that you lived as a 
child, and lived under this horrible th
reat. So I guess you won™t go back. 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I done my duty. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know if duty, but it is 
like going to a grave, you know?  To a grave of my previous life. 
Fa mily and my own life. Ya -- 60
th
 anniversary. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And of c ourse, what else can you expect 
but a good dose of mourning. That™s how I explained 
my -- to my self, what I was going through since 
August [indecipherable] of -- you know, of this 
year. 
Q: Do you think you never had time  to mourn be
fore?  That you were so busy and so moving 
towards your future that you 
didn™t -- you couldn™t mourn? 
A: You™re right. It was a unfinished mourning. 
Because you had -- and pr obably for all of u --  
Q: Yes. 

A: -- I mean, all survivors, you had to 
live against your wish to be dead -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- with your -- with your fa mily. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
159 
 
Q: Right. 
A: To join, you know, the fa mily that was dead. So 
it took all energy to stay 
alive, and not to join 
them.  

Q: Right. And now you were back. Did you find your
 grandmother™s grave?  Did you even look?  
No?  

A: I asked, there was no -- you know, the cemetery 
supervision was in total disarray. They 
couldn™t find graves, so I gave up. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I tried. 

Q: Right. Well, I hope the mourning 
period doesn™t last. That appear
 at so -- at some  point it 
must stop, no? 

A: I hope so. 

Q: I hope so. 
A: And I think you know the interview with La
nzma nn, and with you now, and talk with Raye 
has a lot to do with it. To bring that
 feeling, or maybe of being free of it. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Of the mourning. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know, but what can you do?  How did you 
find that subject with 
other survivors when 
you talked with -- 

Q: I don™t think they™ve talked a
bout this in quit
e the same -- in quite the same way. So I don™t -- 
I -- I don™t know how to s -- I 
don™t know how to tell you. 
A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0500  
160 
 
Q: And I haven™t me t anyone who went b
ack to that anniversary and wondered. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Maybe I™ll ma ke a f -- a few phone calls and as
k and see -- see how they are, based on that. 
Well, thank you. And we™ll shut the cam
era off, and then do your photographs. 
A: It doesn™t have the date
 of my mot her, either. 
Q: Paula, who is this gentlema n here? 

A: That™s my dad.  

Q: And wha t ™s on the back? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Is there some thing on the back
 that you want to [indecipherable] 
A: There™s some  Hebrew writing. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We ll, but he writes in Hebrew some thing, and 
the last sentence is in
 Polish. And he refers, 
really, to hi s expression of the face, which is very angry, and he says it™s a Polish thi-thing. 

[speaks Polish here]. The devil is no
t so terrible as he is painted.  
Q: Oh. 

A: And that™s my mother, and I don™t know fr
om when it is. And those are my parents. 
Q: Right. It™s great shots. 
Yes, Paula [indecipherable]  
A: That™s my father and myself. The y

Q: And on the right? 

A: That™s myself from the same year. 

Q: Okay, this shot? 

A: That™s a pictur e of myself

Q: And this was not a hat of your choice? 
A: Hm?  

Q: This was not a bow of your choice? 

A: Oh God, no. 

Q: On the right? 

A: And this is the pi cture of my si
