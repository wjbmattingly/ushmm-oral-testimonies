Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
 
Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Wallace Witkowski
, conducted by 
Margaret Garrett 
on 
September 1, 1998 in 
Arlington, Virginia
. This interview is part of the museum™s 
project to interview Holocaust survivors an
d witnesses who are also volunteers with 
the museum. This is a follow up 
interview that will focus on Mr.
 Witkowski™s 
post 
Holocaust experiences. In prep aration for this interview, I read a transcript of the 
interview you conducted with
 the museum on Septembe
r 13, 1990. I will not ask 
you to repeat everything that you said in 
that interview, instead, I will use this 
interview as an opportunity 
to follow up on that inte
rview and focus on your post-
Holo caust experiences. This is tape number one, side 
A.
 Would you state your name 
at birth? 
Answer: 
Wallace Œ
 ah, at birth.
 Vodjemiu sz

Arkodiusz
(ph) 
Witkowski
, that is 
the full Polish name. 
Q: And your name currently? 
A: 
Wallace A. Witkowski. 
Q: And the date of your birth? 
A: January 12, 1928.  

Q: And place of birth?

A: I was born in 
Kielce, Poland. 
Q: In the previous interview, you 
spoke briefly about leaving Co mmunist 
Poland
 to 
join your father in
 Detroit.
 Could you talk about what you
 remember that it felt like 
to leave 
Poland
? 
A: Yes, if you humo r me for 
a second, it just struck me 
as you were introducing th is 
interview, that today is September one, and 
to me it is a very emotional date, for 
more than one reason. First of all, as I may 
have put in my earlie
r interview, this is 
when my childhood e
ssentially ended. I was 11 and a 
half and the German armies 
marched into 
Poland
 in  1939. By  a curious co inci
dent, although I don™t believe 
there are coincidence in Œ in creation, last
 September one my mother died at the age 

o f  94 . No w Œ 
Q: That was just one year ago? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So th is is the first anniversary of her death? 
A: Today is the anniversary, yes. My father came to the 
United States 
about 1943, 
he was an officer in the Polish army and 
participated in the effort to recruit 
volunteers during th e war, prior to 
Pearl Harbor.
 Bu t of course Œ and he was 
located with a mission in 
Windsor, Ontario, 
across the river from 
Detroit, 
but 
obviously with the advent of American 
Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose

and liquidated its activ ities and most of the people returned to 
England
 and 
Euro pe. 
However, my father was offered a jo
b in the war industry, he was a 
chemical e ngineer and they 
were highly sought at the tim
e, so he was admitt ed to 
the
 United States
 
cell
. By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts 
to try to find whether we
 survived the war and wher
e we a Œ where are we and 
obviously trying to bring us over. Us 
meaning my  mo ther, my  younger sister and 
myself. Th-The first and obvious step was 
to apply for passports and permission to 
leave the country. My mother received th
at from the government, who Œ which at 
the time was a purportedly government
 of national unity, but it was only a 
transitional period befo re the communists coul
d solidify their grip on that country 
and on th e government, and 
they gave permission to
 my mother to leave 
Poland
 
and join  her husband in the 
United States, 
but did not give a permission to the two 
children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948? I was 20, my  sister was 18. So  I 

determined to escape from 
Poland
 and through contacts, fami ly contacts, 
underground connections, I managed to ge
t on a Swedish coal freighter, which was 
leaving Polish port city of 
Gdy n ia
 and was going to  
Goteborg, Sweden.
 I guess the 
excitement of actually trying to escape a
nd join my  father was so overwhelming 
that I did not have an y nostalgic or any 
reflective thoughts about leaving my  native 

land. To me it was escape from a prison,
 which was beco ming worse and wo rse.

And I was going first so that my sister c
ould follow me on what we thought naively 
would be a safe route. And of co urse, I ma
naged, I succeeded, my  sister didn™t and 
was caught by th e communists and briefly im
prisoned. So , the feelings were not 
dramatic at all, except in 
terms of excitement andgoing
 to my father, whom I had 
not seen for 10 years. And I think I describe
d in my  previous interview, some of the 
feelings that I had when I was arriving in the
 United States
 and trying to  locate my  
father. But that, pretty much, I think 
sh ould an swer your first question. 
Q: Mm-hm. So, then you were in the 
United States
 with your father and later 
joined by your mo th er and your sister. 
A: Sister having to wait several year
s before the gradual mellowing of the 
communist government perm
itted her to leave legally. 
Q: Did you speak English when  you arrived? 

A: I had two years of high school Englis
h, so you can appreciate. A similar 
experience to American kids learning fo
reign languages in high school. It is 
essentially a very, very  superficial knowle
dge of Œ of language. I walked around 
with a dictionary  in my  hand wherever I we
nt, so that I Œ you could Œ I could look 

up word s and co mmunicate. 
Q: You were how old? 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998

A: I turned 21, you may recall from the in
terview, I managed to arrive in the 
United 
States
 three days before my  birthday, my  21
st
 birthday, on which the then American 
immigratio n law would cut me off as a mi
nor child of an American citizen and 
would make me wait for a number of years 
before I could get under a Polish quota. 
But up until January 12, 1949, I could come
 in non-quota, and I made it within three 
days before the deadline. I was very fortunate.  

Q: So you were able 
to become a citizen? 
A: In due time. I Œ I Œ in thr Œ the law at
 that time Œ I was 
married in 1951, two 
years later, and as a husband of an American
 citizen, I didn't have to wait five years, 
I could become a citizen after three year
s. But I did not auto
matically become a 
U.S.
 citizen as a minor child. 
Q: So, you arrived, you™re living w
ith your father, and you don™t s Œ  
A: In 
Detroit. 
Q: In 
Detroit. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You don™t speak ve
ry much English. 
A: And I am several y ears older than my co
ntemporaries, because the first thing that 
I did is to enroll again in an 
American high school, and had 
[indecipherable]
 to be 
sure, and try to graduate from an American
 high school, even though I was alre ady

a graduate of Po lish gymn asium, and I had 
attended first seme ster of a polytechnic 
in Œ in
 Gdansk.  
Q: Okay , wh at year did you enter high school? 
A: American high school? 
Q: I mean, what year of the high sc
hool, wh at class were you placed Œ 
A: O-Oh, the senior year, senior year. 

Q: Senior year. 
A: Yes, yes. The following Œ the followi
ng May I graduated, or
 June. And I went 
through the American high school ritual
s, including th e prom and Œ and all the 
attendant other traditional activities. 

Q: And how were you r
eceived by other kids? 
A: The other kids were very, very nice. 
Curious, open, positive. It was especially 
more Œ more reflective, more thoughtful. 
Kids tried to befriend me, tried to learn 
something from me. I-It was very interesti
ng and very positive. I have encountered 
absolutely no Œ no 
negative reception. 
Q: Were there other refugee children in your high school? 
A: In my particular high school, no. I f
ound some other people wh o survived  the 
war from 
Europe
 in my college years at 
Wayne
 State University.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

A: I had one particular frie
nd, whose name of course, now escapes me. But at the 
time, I discovered that he was a young Jewi
sh boy, maybe a few years younger than 
I, but who attended the 
Wayne
 State University, who told me about his war 
experiences, and he was Jewish and his mo the
r, in the last couple years of war, kept 
him in a barrel somewhere. It Œ and he lived
 in a barrel and that 
stayed with me. But 
in 
Hamtramck
 High School, it was just the 
typical American high school. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Proud, and loafers with pennie
s in them and stuff like this. 
Q: What appealed to you in particular ab
out being in that high school, having those 
friends, being in  that teenage Œ well, you 
weren™t a teenage Œ but being Œ it was a 
teenage culture.  

A: Oh, the girls were very pretty by my standards. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: And I Œ that was probably the most pos
itive thing and Œ and I remember Œ I was 
just reflecting on it recently 
that I took to the prom a lo
vely Hispanic looking girl 
that was just absolutely beautiful and I ba
rely knew her, but I asked her to go to th e 

prom with me, and she did. The negativ
e feelings were awareness of great 
loneliness, because I didn't really fit with 
the crowd, didn™t do anything with them, 
e-except encountered them in Œ in the scho
ol. And I did achieve a sort of a fame

when in the speech class, by go
od old Œ run by good old Mrs. 
Homestead,
 I was 
given an assignment to learn and recite a poe
m, and I did. And in  perfected English, 
which came with considerable difficulty at 
the time, I managed to
 impress the class. 
Forg et what it was. How do
 I love thee, I think. 
Q: And so it took aw hile before y
ou were comfortable with English? 
A: There are two curious stages that I be
lieve not only I, but a number of people 
that I spoke, who Œ to Œ to who were in a 
similar situation, go 
thro ugh. One is, you 
begin to Œ I Œ I forget which came first. Yo
u begin to  dream in English and then  you 
begin to think in  English. Maybe thinking
 comes first an d then
 you begin to dream 
in English. And then  you make this great
, slo w  transition that is so wonderfully 
described by a woman who became quite a 
celebrity, the author of the book, ﬁ
Lo st 
in Translation,ﬂ Eva Hoffman
. I enjoyed that book very 
much. Very, very similar 
experiences in some ways, and in some ways different. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Within two years, b
ecause in spite of the Œ in spite 
of being with the father, I felt 
estranged from him. He wanted me to be 11
 year old that he left behind, and I was 
21. So th at may have contributed to  my  th
 Œ early decision to Œ to  marry, and I met 
a lovely Polish American girl who spoke Po
lish and whose parent
s were very, very 
interested in her marrying a Œ a Polish fellow, 
of course. So I did that, sort of Œ well, 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

this was the first girl I kne
w really intimately and so I 
married in 1951, and th Œ 
even though we were both in
 college, the children came. 
First my  son, born in ™52, 
then my  first daughter, born in ™53. 
Q: And what are their names? 
A: 
Matthew 
and 
Elizabeth. 
Q: So those are not Polish names? 

A: Well, he was called 
Maczik
(ph) and she was called 
Elzunia
(ph), which is in a 
diminutive form, 
Elizabeth
. 
Q: But their actual legal names w ere? 

A: Oh, 
Elizabeth 
and 
Matthew. 
Which is curious because the two girls born of the 
second marriage, 20 years later, have their le
gal names in Polish, even  though their 
mother was not Polish at all. 

Q: So was that mainly your idea
, or mainly your wife™s idea? 
A: No, I Œ I went along with 
the Œ with the Œ it was a jo
int decision of the wife and 
Œ and myself to Œ to give them that Œ that identity, which first they hated and then 

they loved it when th ey discovered 
Œ my  daughter, my  mi ddle daughter, 
Krisha
(ph) 
got into the University of
 Virgin ia
 in
 Charlottesville
, I™m convinced, by writing a 
very beautiful essay on how to  Œ how it fe
els to be a child of Œ of the Polish 
immigrant. And that was a very
 impressive pi
ece of writing.

Q: So, with your second family you were 
more focused on your Polish roots, would 
you say?  
A: I wouldn™t say that that was the case.
 If anything, in the 
second family, I w as 
more focused on being a better father, beca
use the second family
 Œ the first family 
was Œ and life of the first family was char
acterized by an intense effort to become 
Americanized. To learn the language, lear
n the language well, be able to command 
it. After all, I decided to become a lawy
er. And the second and Œ an d the Œ and the 
fathering or the parenting was largely tr
aditional in the first marriage and Œ and 
largely unexamined. And so  I now, in retros
pect of 70 years of age, I think th at I 
was a mu ch better father second time around.  
Q: Going back to your earlier years in 
America
, how did you decide to go to  law 
school? 
A: Hm. I was first interested
 in speech and govern ment and I studied a numb er of 
courses. But by chan ce again, wh ich I do
n™t believe in, I was offered a job as a 
young assistant to two elderly gentle
men who were conducting a Polish radio 
program on 
WJLB
 station in 
Detroit
. At that time this w as one of the 
booth 
stations that specialized in ethnic prog
rams. And every mo rning there were one or 
two hours of Polish language programs. Musi
c, news, advertising. And I started as a

Œ of wh at you call today, a disc jockey. An
d then finally wound 
up, while already in  
law school and using a 
nom de plume
, giving news commentaries. 
Q: What was your 
nom de plume
? 
A: Well, 
Jan Alexander
,
 
which was sort of a comp romise. It could have been  
Polish, it could have been some other 
nationality, so we Œ we Œ I deliberately 
fudged it a little bit. 
Q: Did you Œ you ch oose the name ? 
A: I think Œ I think I did. So me Œ someth
ing struck me. I seem to recall that the 
reason I chose it was deliberate, but it was 
a connectionto either
 the Polish Œ first 
Polish newspaper wh ich Œ 
wh ich was published in 
Poland
 over 300 years ago, or s 
Œ in Œ th ere was some reason, there was 
some  rational Œ there was some rationale 
behind ch oosing that particular assumed na
me to broadcast under. So  that was, at 
that time Œ however, I looked at the broad
casting and I did not see much future for 
the ethnic broadcasting, I felt that it wo
uld keep me a little bit too mu ch in th e 
ethnic community and I wanted to  Œ not
 to limit myself. And I married Œ 
Q: Wh-When you were broa
dcasting, were Œ were yo
u broadcasting in Polish? 
A: In Po lish, yes, so I continued my  Po
lish and th at™s why I was Œ I was picked by 
the owners of the program because I had goo
d diction, good ra Œ what we called the 
radiophonic voice and therefore they thought
 that was a good addition of a good, 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

14
fresh voice to their broadcast. And the y
oung lady that I married, her father was a 
lawyer. And so I worked part time in his o
ffice as a clerk, and 
then I thought hm, I 
like dealing with people, I lik
e helping people, I Œ why not? And so I Œ by that time 
I was in the third year of
 my college education at 
Wayne. 
And at that time 
Wayne 
State University had a so-
called combined curriculum. 
If you could maintain a 
certain level of grades, 
B 
minus I think it was, in the firs
t year Œ first three years of 
undergraduate studies, you could go to la
w school, and assuming that you maintain 
your level of grades in the first year of 
law school, you would th en receive credit for 
the f-fourth year of undergradua
te sta Œ study and get your 
B.A.
, which is what I 
did. And then two mo re years and then I had my  
L.B., 
which was later changed 
retrospectively to 
J.D., juris doctor, 
doctor of laws. 
Q: And where did you go to law school? 
A: Same
 Wayne 
State University, since I lived in 
Detroit.
 I graduated from
 Wayne
 
State in 19 Œ from the law school in 1956. And for the next six years, I joined my  
father-in-law in private practice, which was 
mo stly probate and real estate and very  
simp le neighborhood ethnic Œ ethnic prac
tice because obviously
 we turned our 
bilingual skills into assets by Œ by 
working with the Polish community.  
Q: So you often dealt with your 
clients in the Polish language? 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

A: Oh yes, oh yes. Toward
s the last two years in 
Detroit
, around 1960 or so, I was 
even appoin ted by two successive mayors of 
Detroit
 as a member of the 
community relations commission, which 
was a so-called racial commission. 
Detro i t
 
had a very  checkered history of
 racial relations and they 
wanted some Œ they Œ they 
Œ people appointed people to these commiss
ions. They  wanted representatives of 
ethnic communities to kind of
 dialog and Œ and work toge
ther on racial problems of 
the city. But then, of course, I had to 
resign from that commi
ssion and give up my  
practice when in 1962 I was offered a job in 
Washin gton
, which was to last three 
years, and it was again in Œ in the area 
of both languages, be
cause it was handling 
the claims for World War II 
losses by the Œ by th e Americ
an nationals who suffered 
these losses in 
Poland
 and it required knowledge of Po lish. 
Q: Now these would be American citizen
s, probably of Polis
h descent who had 
property 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Most of the claimants, interestingly 
enough, were survivors of the owners of 
property in 
Poland
, very often relatives, a su bstan
tial number of them Jewish, who 
laid claims to compensation for 
reasons that the whole family in
 Pola nd
 was wiped 
out by the Nazis, that they were the next
 of kin now. Bu t there were a number of 
requirements. The ownership of the property in 
Poland
 had to be established to Œ 
ownership had to be establis
hed that it Œ let me start again. Owners had to be

American nationals at the time of loss, they
 could not have had it Œ it™s a legal issue 
that I don™t go in to because it Œ I don™t thi
nk it™s Œ it™s too technical. If someone 
subsequently became an American citizen
, it d idn™t count because he was not a 
citizen of the 
United States 
at the time of loss. The language of the agreement 
between the 
United States
 government and govern ment of 
Poland, 
communist 
government of 
Poland
 specified that these losses, th
ese claims will be compensated 
only to the extent to Œ to Œ 
to Œ to which the owners we
re Americans at the time of 
loss. Do dogs bother you, 
Marcia
? 
Q: And what appealed to you abou
t taking this job, this position? 
A: Well, two things, 
Wa sh ing t on
, the capitol of the 
United States. 
An opportunity 
to broaden my  experience as a lawyer, an
d a certain prestige that went with being 
selected as an identifiable Polish Am
erican to work on 
Œ on the Claims 
Co mmissio n . 

Q: And the content of the wo rk, 
did that have appeal for you? 
A: That was very, very appealing from the 
point of view, not onl
y being interesting, 
but also permitted me to utilize my knowle
dge of the country, my knowledge of 
Polish history, my knowledg
e and insight into  Œ of character of ma ny of these 
losses. Maybe not so much the 
character of the losses as be
ing able to deliver to my 
government a Œ a f Œ a Œ a sort of a sobe
r objective, hopefully, assessment of not

17
only the possibility that these people rea
lly lost claims. There were a lot of 
outrageous claims that were based on to ta
l fiction sometimes. And being able to Œ 
to assist my superiors in saying that th
is is not probable, we better check this 
through our field office. An
d in fact, in 1963, within
 a year, I was sent to 
Wa rsa w
 
for three months to help run the field office that was verifying claims of American 
citizens by going th rough th e country, checki
ng the land records 
if they existed, 
checking, investigating with the neighbors 
and people who still li
ved there, whether 
such and such family really owned the bakery
 or really had the butcher shop or Œ or 
Œ or owned the Œ an apartment house, a
nd that was very rewarding, I-I think. 

Q: And what did it feel like for you to be back  in 
Poland
? 
A: It was also very gratifying because I we
nt on official passports, so it™s a native 
boy who Œ who did well, comes back with the official 
U.S.
 passport, not the tourist 
passport. And I was given all the privileges of the American embassy in 
Wa rsaw
 
and I Œ i-it was an accomplishment. 
Q: Did you have friends and family in
 Poland
? 
A: Oh, I had many, many aunts and first c
ousins and we got together, it was a great 
time. It was also a lot of fun, in addition to
 working very hard an
d trying to Œ trying 
to adjudicate Œ not adjudicate, but recomme
nd an adjudication of these claims. So it 
was a very good experience, from a profe
ssional point of view, wh ich later qualified

me to be offered a job in 
Western Pacific
 when Œ when I went to 
Micronesia
 in 
™70, wh ich I men Œ ma y 
have mentioned before. 
Q: I don™t think that™s on 
your previous interview. 
A: Maybe I skipped that altogether. I wa
s already work ing for the Federal Trade 
Commission, when a general counsel 
from th e foreign claims settlement 
commission called me  and said, we 
would like to offer you a job in 
Micronesia
, 
and I said micro-where? And of course I ag
reed, provided they 
borrowed me, as one 
agency  borrowing an  employee from anothe
r, so I could return to my steady job. 
And for three years I wo
rked in the western 
Pacific
, on the island of
 Saipan. 
I was 
a member of the Claims Commission at on
e time Œ well, I was a vice-chairman of 
the commission and at one time even an ac
ting chairman when 
the prior chairman 
was sacked. But that permitted
 me to still extend my expe
rience to a rather exotic 
location and assignment and Œ 
and continue my  Œ my  Œ my
 mo saic of Œ of legal 
experience. I was dealing with
 very Œ what we would call 
in this society, primitive 
societies. B u t I discovered it just because 
it was not a society th
at maintained good 
written records. Claims and stories that they
 gave us were absolutely accurate and 
we develo ped a system of Œ of dealing with  claims similar to the one that we did 
when we were dealing with 
Poland
. What stuck out of the profile of a typical claim 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

required greater scrutiny th an Œ outrageous
 claim required considerable degree of 
proof. 
Q: Do you think that your 
experien ce during the war had anything to do with  your 
feeling about wo rking for fairness and justice? 

A: I felt very righteous doing th e right thin
gs. I was not involved,
 thank God, in any 
le Œ any professional activity that would re
ally be testing my  values, or causing a 
crisis to me in what I believed in. I felt ve
ry righteous. In fact, I remember on a very 
crucial precedent decision that the commi
ssion issued, I sided with two native 
commissioners against two American commi
ssioners. And because there were five 
members o f the commission, the Œ the majo
rity prevailed and Œ and I was the swing 
vote. I felt very good about it,
 when trying to look at 
the values from the point of 
view of the island culture and not from th
e point of view of American society™s 
values and Œ and Œ an d culture, because th
e loss that these people suffered was a 
loss in their minds, in Œ in Œ 
in their terms, on their terms 
Œ no, in their terms, a-and 
that had to be addressed. 

Q: Mm-hm. We™re getting near the end of 
th e tape, so let™s stop here and turn  it 

over. 
A: Very good.

Q: Œ continuation of a 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Wallace Witkowski
, tape one, side
 B.
 Mr. 
Witkowski
, 
could you continue to talk about y
our professional career? You were in 
Micronesia
, 
and then what? 
A: I spent three years in
 Micronesia
 and like people who come to 
Washin gton 
get 
Potomac
 fever, I too had a very  difficult time leaving the
 Micronesian 
experience 
behind. I think it was a turning poin t for me
 in the sense that I saw a very simple 
society, with very  simp le needs, very simp le ambitions, that Œ whose me mb ers 
appeared to be very happy 
and very content. We did co
rrupt them a little bit with 
the ease of agricultural su
rplus commodities, availab
ility. Using our standards 
applied to  the island star Œ standards, mo st
 of these people were below the level of 
poverty, but they lived off of subsiste
nce agriculture, and th
ey didn™t know how 
little they had until the Ameri
cans told them. That was a 
turning point in the sense 
that I admitted to myself and discovered th
at I no longer need to try to be any mo re 
American than I became, and I 
can be just simply myself.  

Q: Well, how were you trying t Œ pr
eviously to be more American? 
A: It™s very hard to articulate, 
but any person born abro ad , coming to  
America
, tries 
very hard to become Americ
anized, at least it™s a typical
, let™s say, pattern. I mean, 
there will be staunch individu
alists who will refuse to 
become Americ
an, they will

be French or they will be Ge
rman, or they will be this a
nd that, for reasons of either 
because they think that their ethnic backgr
ound or cultural backgr
ound is superior to 
the American Œ many, ma
ny foreigners come to 
America
 with a rather superior 
feeling about their own culture. It™s a defe
nse mechanism of sort, I believe. Here, I 
was trying to absorb American values, Am
erican customs, American tradition. I 
wanted my  children to be American, after a
ll, they are my  roots in this country . I 
simply wanted to be able to 
live in this society and functi
on in this society the best I 
could. Returning from
 Micronesia
 made me aware that I don™t have to prove to 
my self anything, or climb yet another mo untain, or Œ fo r example, when I returned 
to
 Wash ington
, I resumed my career at the F ederal Trade Commission, and there I 
discovered that I really  don™t care about th
e antitrust in which I was working at the 
time, that it dealt with ec
onomic and sh ifting issues. 
I spent two or three years 
battling a Œ a ca Œ in Œ in Œ fighting in a ca
se in which the law was changed after Œ 
after a couple years and I felt the Œ like st
anding on a shifting sand. I realized also 
that I™m not happy not dealing with people.
 So then I switched
 in my career to 
consumer protection, because the Fe
deral Trade Commission has two main 
functions. The antitrust Œ enforcement of theantitrust laws, which it shares with the 
justice department, and the consumer prot
ection fo  Œ mission. And I felt mu ch mo re 
comfortable in the consumer protection area
. And in fact, I continued from a year or

two after I returned from
 Micronesia
 until I retired in 1994 Œ 
four. So that was the 
rest of my career in the government. I Œ I 
was an enforcement attorney, and a senior 
attorney, thought of well, getting good re
views. But I realized that I came to 
Washin gton 
for three years and I stayed in 
the government 32 years. I was 
qualified to retire, and I was getting Œ I was 
ready to move on, and in the meantime, 
personal crises, my second marriage faile
d also. I started  worrying about myself, 
who am I and what am I doing with my 
life and what™s going on? And I started 
examining my  life probably around th e age of
 50, not before. By
 that time I was a 
father of four. I was bravely putting them
 through school and supporting them and 
giving th e older children educations. Th
ank God the two younger ones came 20 
years later, I was able to take a breather be
fore the Œ the last two daughters went to 

college. But I gave all of them educa
tion, except that I was examining and 
beginning to  question all the values in 
which I grew up. I was a churchgoer, I 
actively participated in a number of activities 
in the parishes to which I belonged to. 
But as many contemporaries will tell you, not
 all of my  needs were satisfied. I went 
into therapy, first of all, because I really  got scared when my second marriage failed 

and I felt unhappy an d I felt alienated a
nd I felt a failure. And so, started my 
spiritual journey with reading su ch semi-s
piritual but still tho
ught provoking books

or even 
M Œ
 wh at™s 
his name, ems Œ 
George Peck 
or 
Scott Peck
? 
Q: 
Scott Peck. 
A: 
Scott Peck, ﬁThe Road Less Traveled.ﬂ
 One of the unfortu
nate developments 
caused by the age that I Œ I forget names, 
places, things. We call it senior mo ments, 
but I™m sure you™ve heard that na
me before Œ that term before. 
Peck
 was an 
influence. A numb er of other things that 
I read were also very helpful in beginning 
to turn to Œ to wh
at do I believe in and wh ere am
 I going and what™s happening. 
And in the meantime I also di
scovered in therapy, both i
ndividual and group that a 
number of years may have passed since the 
war, but the experiences, the feelings, 
the emotional and psychic wounds rema ined 
from that period. No t only the fear that 
absolutely paralyzed many of 
us for a long period of time during the years of very 
brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling 
of total helplessness, that there was not 
mu ch we could do about it. I spoke abou
t the feeling of helplessness when I saw 
and heard that my friends fro
m grade school were killed or
 murdered wa Œ together 
with their parents. I witnessed situati
ons in wh ich I stood there and couldn™t do 
anything wh ile some people were brutali
zed by other people. 
I personally cowered 
when  Œ when a man in a uniform with a gun 
in his hand told me to do th ings, and I 
had to obey him. Open up my
 briefcase, show him what
 I had. That was, by the 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
24
way, a briefcase in which I carried music. I 
was, at that time trying to study piano a 
little bit, didn™t last very long, but I wa
s stopped by a German patrol and th e same 
feeling of being abso lutely helpless and viol
ated. These things stay with us and the 
sense of injustice, a sense of outrage 
at the power being im
posed on you against 
your will. So perhaps that explains why 
I chose to work for 
the government and 
maybe make less money than in  private pr
actice, because even
tually in private 
practice I would have made a lot mo re
 money than Œ than  wo rking fo r the 
government, a rigid grade system and all th
at stuff, you just got
 so much money and 
that™s it. Although I am not
 comp laining, I was Œ I was a high grad e and I have a 
nice, comfortable retirement, which is Œ 
totally satisfies me. 
Spiritually, I went 
through a sort of a Œ I don™t know how to 
describe it, aw akening. I searched for a 
system of beliefs that would mo re be res
ponding to my instinc
tive need to correct 
something that is wrong, becau
se at times I d id not feel sinful, at times I did not feel 
guilty. Although by th
e presets of my church, I was a sin ful, guilty lost soul and I 
had to really try very  hard and sacrifice 
a lot before I would maybe gain salvation. 
Q: Now, you were Catholic? 

A: Yes, yes. Catholics are very good on gu
ilt and Œ and sin and sacrifice. I™m saying 
it somewhat sarcastically. I discovered a 
teaching, which is called a Course in 
Miracles, about 10 years ago,
 and I read the introduction 
and I said to myself, these 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

25
are the words that I have always searched  for, and these are the words that are 
saying what I have been  craving to hear 
and to Œ to learn, to know. And started 
studying it, and I reached the point that
 the teaching was so powerful and so 
persuasive and so deep, that I started Œ I 
felt the need to share it with two closest 
beings to me, my mother and my sister. 
At that time my  father had died, died a 
fulfilled man, because he managed to bring his fa
mily together, managed to give me 
and my sister education in spite of the ho
rrible ordeals of World War II. So I started 
translating some things into
 Polish that really moved me, really reached me. In the 
course of subsequent years, it Œ 

Q: You tra Œ excuse me, you translate Œ 
A: Into Polish. 
Q: Œ into Polish Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ for what reason? 
A: To share it. 
Q: To share it with? 

A: With whoever doesn™t know English en ough Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ to Œ to study it in
 the Polish language. 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
26
Q: Okay . 
A: I then discovered that there are other pe
ople who seriously want to translate the 
text of this teaching into Polish. Th
ere were already at that time going on, 
translations into a numb er of other langua
ges. And to make the long story short, 
through a process of submitting samples of
 translations and 
reviewing them and 
commenting on them, the Foundation for In
ner Peace, which is a publisher of the 
course, chose a young man in 
Warsaw
, young man from my  point of view, 
relatively speaking, the man in his 40™s, and Œ 
as a translator and me as an editor of 
his translation. We essentially were transl
ating and making sure that the trans Œ the 
substance of each sentence, each paragraph 
and chapter is Œ is 
correctly rendered in 
Polish. And we just completed the task of
 translating 1200 pages of a very, very  

deep metaphysical work . And Frid
ay I will be in the state of
 New York
 in Œ in a 
teaching foundation, where we will be talkin g about the publication of that. So that 

was my  great, great project of transla
ting, of course, vol
unteering, and what 
happened  is Œ and I™m ramb ling, even thou
gh I thought that I 
would be doing mo re 
legal work of some sort after I gra Œ 
after I graduate Œ after I retire from the 

government, I discovered that practice of
 law  is so bureaucratically impeded by 
various bar associations and I need  to join  
and I need to  l Œ be licensed that Œ that I 
na Œ just naturally evolved that I am a tran
slator today. In the meantime, I picked up 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
27
other pe-p eople and other projects that I acte
d  as a translator or an interpreter. There 
was a period wh en th e American labor movement was deeply interested in the 

evolution of the independent labor movement in commu nist
 Poland ,
 the solidarity 
movement. And wh en th e first 
representatives came to the 
United States
, I was 
asked by
 UAW
, United Auto Workers to
 be their translator and escort interpreter 
and I traveled with them. And I also 
attended a number of their constitutional 
conventions, whenever th
ey have a delegate from 
Poland
, to escort him and 
translate fo r him, and also what he says
 to the convention. 
And then, also came 
volunteer work  for the Holocaust Museum. Th
at had deeper roots. I sought this 
work out myself. I felt Œ 
Q: And when was that? 
A: You know, I don™t know. I don™
t remember any more, but I know Œ 
Q: Had th e mu seum opened wh en  you sought 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yes, oh even when the 
first efforts at the mu seum Œ at the organiza Œ or-
organizing the museum took pl
ace, I was, as you can tell 
from the interview in 1990 
Œ first of all, I donated a number of bo
oks and pamphlets and materials to the 

museum, because when I was 
handling the American claims for property lost in 
Poland,
 when I was working fo r the Fo reign Claims Settlement Commi ssion, and 
when  I was stationed in 
Wa rsa w
, I managed to reach the people, the survivors who 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

28
are running the Jewish Historical Institute in 
Warsaw
. And I obtained from them a 
number of unique publications
, such as witness accounts 
of liquidation of ghetto of
 
Sosnowiec
 or of some other Œ 
Bialystok,
 rather obscure publications, of which 
there weren™t very many, you know, issues
 available. You couldn™t find it in a 
library. But I brought all of 
these things with me. And wh en the museum opened, I 
thought I would donate all of these things to th e mu seum and that™s how my  

cooperation with the museum started. I 
turned over all of those things. There 
weren™t very  many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pa
mphlets, but they are today in the 
library. And then I think you 
th en come in and you have 
read my interview in 1990, 
so you know where I felt that
 I needed to testify as a 
witness to what I knew from a 
unique perspective of being this boy scout 
troop leader who had a boy in my  troop 
who told me the story about his brother 
being lost and then militia taking him, 

communist militia taking him to the house in
 which the Jewish survivors lived and 
saying to  the little boy, it Œ is Œ were you ke
pt here? And the kid said yes. That™s Œ 
that™s the version that I received from my 
Œ  fro m my  me mb er o f  my  tro op .  So  I felt 
duty bound to give testimony to  the truth as 
I know it. So that™s
 how the interview 
came about. And then I realized that I can be
 of help in th e oral department. And I 
no longer remember Œ but I know that I subm
itted my offer to Œ to translate. That 
was lost somewhere and so mebody Œ on 
somebody™s desk for a year, then I Œ 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
29
nothing was done about it. One day I enquir
ed, aren™t you intere
ste d  in somebody 
who knows both languages and can translate? 
Yes, yes, submit an application. Well, 
okay. I don™t know what happened to Œ finally I Œ I was put in touch with th e oral 
history department and was as
ked to help  them in translating mo re significant key 
testimony of witnesses who were
 testifying in Polish. And over the last two, three 
years, I lose track of it because these were
 long translations, long projects. I w o rked  
on th e 
Mo rd o wicz
 translation, which is an incr
edible story of a ma n who tw ice 
escaped from 
Auschwitz
 and lived to tell. And anothe
r long and dramatic testimony 
of a woman who n Œ was one of the early inmates in 
Auschwitz
-
Birkenau
, 
Ozhrenczim
(ph) 
Druzhinikov
(ph), and also lived Œ and what was particularly 
moving about it was the fact that she admits
 in the course of th
e interview that in 
crucial moments in her life in the camp,
 or after the camp, it was her Jewish 
girlfriends who saved her life. That was a ve
ry wrench ing job to  do. It was a type of 
work  that I could wo rk on, and then  I had 
to go away from it 
for days sometimes, 
sometimes a couple weeks before I could retu
rn to  it. It was just too devastating to  
relive with this person, what she had to
 say. I™m delaying 
giving you the name 
because I Œ I have a mental br Œ block right now, and I cannot remember her name, 

but of course, 
Amy Rubin
 knows because these are la Œ my  two primary claims to 
fame as a translator, a volunteer translator for the museum. Why, the most difficult 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
30
question to answer. Because you see, more
 th an 50 years may have passed since 
those years of Nazi occupation in 
Poland
, but the events and the feelings stay with 
us and so mehow I feel that this is my 
way of doing so mething, because then I was 
not able to do anything. And 
secondly, on a deeper level,
 it is my feeling that in 
some way I am engaged in some act of expi
ation or Œ or contritio
n on behalf of my 
countrymen, for things 
that they did, or failed to do
 when  they could have. Now, I 
do not minimize the mutual accusations betw
een the Christian Poles and the Jewish 
Poles against each other. Anti-Semitism certa
inly was and is alive, unfortunately, 
which is a curious phenomenon because there are no mo re Jews in 
Poland
 and yet, 
something in  Œ something has caught both gr
oups in Œ in Œ in 
this vicious circle. 
Now there is a controversy about Poles putti
ng up Ch ristian crosses in Œ in the place 
in wh ich both Poles and Jews died, and Je
wish tradition, of course, requires that 
nothing be done there 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ and th ere are radicals in both groups 
that foment discord. So  I Œ somehow I Œ I ju
st feel that whatever I can do to just 
assist  the museum in its mi ssion, I™ll 
do it. And even  though I am now in the 
process of moving to 
Michigan
 and I will be spending 
most of my time in 
Michigan, 
I will be connected by m
odern technology with 
Wash ington, 
with the 
mu seum, and 
Amy Rubin
 knows that any time she n
eeds something from me , she 
can do it just like she did here. Give me th
e video of the interview of a witness in 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski  
 
September 1, 1998 
 

 
 
31
Polish, give me a transcript
, and I will sit down and I™ll translate it and give it back 
to her, as long as I™ll Œ my mind is still working. 
Q: And you said you want to help the mu se
um carry out their mi
ssi on. What do you 
see as the mission of the museum? 

A: Well, it™s been asked of me a Œ a num
ber of times previously, including some 
video interviews. This ties in very deeply 
with my spiritual va
lues. I think Œ think 
that not only the mission of the mu seum, 
of teaching people that intolerance, 
prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly 
phenomena that characterize our life on 
earth, have to be eradicated, elimin ated. 
But we have to, ever so slowly, try to 
awaken to the fact that we
 are all members o f oneness, 
we are all children of God, 
we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and 
as long as we con
tinue looking at other 
people as separate and distinct from a Œ 
from us, we Œ we are not going to  find our 
way back to our creator. And I 
am a firm believer in that. And I, in this sense too, I 

see my work for the museum as Œ as 
possibly indirectly contributing. I am 
extremely impressed with the skill and en
thusiasm and Œ and Œ and Œ and energy 
with which the museum was 
created, is being supporte
d, is being developed and 
continues its work. And I want to be a part of
 it, but I also want to be a part of the 
general effort to teach all of us, and the 
museum is doing its 
share, showing other, 
equally eg regious holoca Œ Ho
lo caust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

32
they Armenians or Œ or just
 because some county is in 
Asia
, that should not matter 
less than a mil Œ million people were kille
d because they were Asian rather than 
they were other group, religious or ethnic. 
So I guess this is the best I can articulate 
at this point, why I committed to 
Œ to Œ to work 
for the museum.  
Q: Is there anything else th
at you would like to talk about? 
A: I only have concern that a lot of wh at I sa
id is not going to be of Œ really of Œ of 
Œ well, maybe it will be of peripheral value, 
peripheral value to you to Œ to Œ to see 
what kind of people volunteer. But I think th
e Œ that Œ that I volunteer for a slightly 
different reason than  let™s say a Œ a typi
cal, if I may use that word, survivor 
volunteer work s for the mu seum
. There is a deep, tragic, 
desperate effort to make 
sure that the people who died, didn™t die 
in vain, without any Œ any lessons to be 
learned from it. So I can Œ I respect my Œ I 
Œ I Œ I Œ I am in awe of th ese people who 
come and travel a long distance sometimes,
 to spend a couple hours in the mu seum, 
just being escorts, or Œ or guides. My 
commitment is the same and yet somewhat 
different, because even though all the men in
 my family died as a result of the war, 
except my father, who surviv
ed  the war, but I had uncles. One, a pilot who died in
 
England
, another persecuted 
and Œ and killed by the communi
sts, I feel that I have 
the need to assist in preserving th e story 
of the Holo caust and teaching. In one of 
the interviews I said six million or seve
n million died, and they™re silenced, so 

 
Interview with Wallace Witkowski

33
somebody has to speak in thei
r place. Even if I am just 
translating little pieces of the 
Œ of the story, I Œ I hope that I am ma
king a contribution. And I™m waiting for them 
to give me more while my brain is 
still functioning. After all, I am 7 0 . 
Q: So you™re planning to  continue? 

A: Definitely, if Œ if they just
 don™t mind sending the stuff to 
Michigan, 
to rural 
Michigan 
rather than calling me to come in, or sending it to 
Arlington. 
Q: Anything else, before we stop? 
A: No, I cannot think of anything. The difficu
lt part of it is that even though that 
interview in 1990 was a two videocassettes 
long, I can still not Œ I still cannot make 
myself look at it. Like I probably will not be
 able to listen to 
this interview that 
you™re conducting with me today. It is
 helping me in a sense that somehow I 
unburden myself, th
at I Œ that I lessen the weight of
 memory by talking about it, but 
I don™t want to review it. No, I cannot th
ink of anything else 
that I would like to 
add. 

Q: Well, thank you very mu
ch fo r your contribution. 
A: My pleasure, in a new sense of the word .
