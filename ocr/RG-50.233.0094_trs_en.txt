 FRAMINGHAM,MASSACHUSETTS
 
 
 
 
The date is April 1, 19
92.  We 'r e speaking with 
Mr. Izz y Mi lkow in Fra m
ingham, Massachusetts. 
Mr. Milkow, could you please tell 
me your na me , your da te of 
birth, your pl ace of birt h a n d  
whatever you possibl y can 
a bout your  chil dhood.  
 
 
Hi, my name is Isr
ael Milkow.  I wa s born in 
Slonim on February 15, 
1937.  From 1937 unt il I  
belie ve 1941, I  live d wi th my 
par ent s i n Sloni m.  I also ha
d four  br othe rs bes i de me .
 
 
Do you wa nt  to te
ll  me t h eir n a mes?
 
 
Ok ay .  T he na mes  were  Ye
r achmi el, he was t he oldest .  And t h
en came  Sh
evach, Yosef and Moshe 
and I believe I was the young
est .  What wa s ha ppe ning i s  that  my
 father, I  belie ve, wa s  a baker.  He  
worked for different  bakeries, I be
lie ve.  And I  would clas si fy t he m 
as--t hey were poor peopl e, poor  
wo rking people.  I believ
e my  mo th er 's  rela
tives lived about 30 kilomete
rs away from Sloni m in a  
small shtetl.  Each 
year, each summer, what  was 
happeni ng is t hat one of us
 br othe rs would go i nto 
the shtetl--the name of it was Kaslovchina, I still 
remember it.  And 
in 1941, in the 
summer of 1941, 
it was my turn apparently to come
 t o  my uncle.  I  live d duri ng th
e summer there an
d in 1939 when  
the wa r broke out, the Ru ssi
ans ca me  to our  part  of Pola nd.  So 
I remember that  th
ere wer e a lot  of  
refugees fr om Poland who 
escaped t he Ger mans and t here was a l ot 
of talk about it. 
 Most  of t he m  
wer e li ving a round the  s y nagogues  or  in 
t he Jewish communi ty an
d we coul d s ee t he m.
 
 

 
Did you have any sens
e  at t his  poi nt  about  what  wa s goi ng on
?  Did you understa
nd at all?  You 
were still young.
 
 
Not really, all I know is 
that there wa s a lot of 
commotion and a lot of ta
l k.  I n 1941 whe n the  
Ger mans att acked the second hal f 
of Russia , I wa s wit h my uncle, 
t hat I remember .  What happene d  
is, my uncl e  wa s a far mer .  He  wa
s-- they did not have any c hil dren. 
 My aunt and uncle didn't have  
any children.  My mother's 
whole fa mily lived in that 
shtetl so there were a 
lot of aunts and uncles 
and relatives there.  Now 
this particular uncle, hi
s  na me was  Her shel , he  wa s a fa r mer.  He kne w t h e  

language, he kne
w Russian and Polish 
and he knew how to trade with
 the gentiles.  Wh en the  
Russians came, he got a position with them.  He
 wa s very we ll-known in 
the community, not as a 
Je wish sc holar but  rather as a  
so-t o-sa y horse  tra der
.  He  kne w  t he  l angua ge, he  wa s like  a  
policeman and a fireman an
d he was well-known in th
e gentile community.  So
 any transaction that 
had to go through wo uld go throu
gh his hands.  So wh en the Russian
s came, mo st of the Jews  who 
did not  agr ee  wit h t heir philos ophy woul d be pers ecu
te d a nd s ent t o Sibe ri a 
and we knew that  ever y 
ti me  pe opl e some how were eli mi nate
d.  I n his c as e, I belie ve t hat he
 felt  c o mfort able  wit h the ne w  
regi me .  He had horse s a nd he  was  
able to do his trade. 
 By the Russians comi ng
 in, in 1939 did not 
do hi m any har m.  I n 1941,
 wh en the Germans started to attack, 
we kne w a hea d of ti me  bec a us e we  
coul d...  We l l , firs t the 
uncle was  well -infor me d of anythi ng th
at was going on.  
He could not drop 
me  off back to Slonim where my
 par ents  were  be caus e Sl oni m was  alr ea dy bei ng occ upie d by t he  
Germans.  Since he live d in this small shtetl there,
 a vill age, we were able
 t o run a w ay t hrough the  
forest .  So he packed up the wa
gon, t ook his  wi fe , other  rela ti ves  
and my self and we
 got traveling 
through the countryside.  We reac
hed some of the big cities like Mi
nsk but that was 
being attacked 
and the n we  reac he d the  city of Mogulovin (ph)( c.79) a nd Ki ev a nd that 
wa s being attacked.  By  
then the horses were of no
 use  to us  a nd whoeve r re mained of th
e r elati ves ,  the  gr oup t h at ra n a w ay 
fr om the shtetl, we tr
a ve led by trai n to t he  s out hern pa rt of 
Ru ssia .   I  re me mb er  l ots  o f  ti me s , th e  
trains  woul d be  bombar de
d by Ger m an pla nes .  Eve r y ti me  pl
anes  woul d be  over he ad, we  woul d 
run out of--a nd hi de and t hen c onti nue
 with the trains.  I 
don't know the exact ti
me  but the train took 
us all the way to the city of Sa markand which is 
in Uzbe kist an i n t he  souther n part , sout hwest er n  
part of Russia.  There 
we settled among the native
s.  It was very hot.
 
 
We re t here other refu
gee s  at t hat  ti me?
 
 
Yes, yes.  We were a wh
ole group of people comi ng--a  lot  of 
J ewi sh pe opl e es pecia lly- - coming on  
the train and other trains.  Becaus
e t h at was the only sa
fe pl ace, i s t he furt
her away fr om c entra l  
Russia .  When we  settl e d 
there, we had to get  used t o t he envi
ronment.  It was ver y hot , a t otall y 
ne w la nguage, e ven though s o me of t he people s p oke
 Russi an, but t he nati ves did not .  A l ot of us , 
the  Eur ope a n pe opl e  got  si ck, eit h
er  mal aria  or  t yphus .  The  wat e
r  looke d like  blac k coffe e wi th 
cream and mosq
uitos and ...
 
 
Where  di d you slee p?
 
 
We ll, we had little houses there, 
I remember, littl
e mud houses.  Apparently 
the uncle did bring with 
hi m some  ki nd of money b
eca use  we  wer e  abl e  to get  a  house .   
But as soon as we  
came there within 
six mont hs, his  wi fe  die d, other  rela tives  die d  a n
d t hen he  beca me  sic k . 
 And I think he became  
disill usione d beca use he t hought th
at he was a bi g shot and he thou
ght that the Russi
ans were going 
to he lp hi m, the government a nd ever ythi ng else . 
 But  once we  wer e there , ever ythi ng st opped an d 

ever ybody wa s on t heir  own.
  So within a year also he died ev
e n though he was physicall y a ver y  

strong man and capable of ta
king care of hims elf but 
he j ust- --I  beli eve  he di
ed either of mal aria or  
of typhus.  He  wa s  in t h
e hospital.  I used to 
come  and visit hi m and so
mehow some of the other 
relatives or  a cquainta nce s  die d an
d t he n what ha ppene d wa s t ha t  I 
was taken into a 
children's home . 
That  parti c ul ar plac e  was  a  mi xtur
e  of I  woul d sa y mostl y  Je wis h  
ki ds  but ther e  wer e a l so some  
Chr i stia ns .  It was  run by t he Russi a n governme nt
 probably. I don'
t  ha ve too ma ny
 recollections 
there    For t hose who su
rvived--I believe it was really a miracl
e to get out of that  place because the 
fa cilities was terrible.  We slept on
 the floor and the mattr
esses were lined
 up on the fl oor one next 
to the other.  You had a little place
 just to put your head
 there.  The fo od was 
terrible.  
I reme mber 
that--I  mean the chil dren 
there ran probably fr
om the age of three and fo ur
 t o  t h e a g e  o f  fi ft een  a n d  
sixtee n, whoever they coul d... 
 It wa s a gathe r ing poi nt.  Ev
ery mor ning, we woul d take the  
mattresses to dry out beca
use the fa cilities....  First 
of all, we did not have 
indoor plumbing, okay. 
We  lived among the native
s and the authorities were 
kind of harsh on us. 
 Anything you would do,  
they would beat youa nd yell and r epr i ma nd.
 
 
What  langua ge, di d you s pea k Russia n?
 
 
Ru ssian.  At  that time 
we spoke Russian there.
 
 
You ha d l ear ned it j ust  by ...?
 
 
Yeah, but among ourselves we
 did talk Yiddish.  We  knew that 
we  were Jewi sh pe
ople.  There was 
some  ki nd of Je wi sh in
fl uence because I  reme mber
 the older people , t he older chil dre n  would even  
try to recite some of
 the prayers, li ke the Shem
a to let us know, 
espe cially the younger children that 
there is hope and t hat sooner or l a
ter, all of this will be 
over  and we 'll go ba ck 
to Poland.  Now, also 
there was a l ot of acti viti es from Sa
markand in those years that Je ws went  to Palestine through--we 
were right on the Iranian border.  
I f you look at a map you'll  see t hat
 Iran was next t o--and at  that  
ti me  t hey woul d go.  And es peci
ally the Polish army
 sta rted t her e a nd the y would go fr om 
Sa markand and the ot her places to Ir
an, then Iraq, and then
 to Palestine.  As a matter of fa ct, I was 
readi ng about M ena che m Begi n.  He  went  thr oug
h this  sa me  route  and t h
at 's how he  ca me  t o  
Palestine then.  So a lot of peop
le, a lot of the Jewish
 pe opl e es caped, c a me t o Is rae l , Pale stin e  
through that part.  We ll 
I did not.  I reme mber  a lot of the ch
ildren who were in 
the chil dren's home 
died and there was somehow ev
er y t i me you c ould se e a ne w c h
ild would come  a nd some body  
would die.  There was very little fu
ss about it.  A child 
died, it died. 
 There was like 
nobody to cry 
for the child because the parents ha
ve died already and there were 
no relatives.  To
 the authorities 
we  were  ju st  an oth er 
na me or  whateve r .  
 
 
Did you have a sense 
at this point about  your  family, that  
you woul dn't  s ee  the m a ga i n?   Did you 
underst and t hat?
 

 
Hone stly spe aking, s o me how I  di dn't 
think of them.  I start 
to think about my fa mi
ly much later.  In  
thos e da ys, I  thi nk I  was  too nai ve.
  It was a question of
 sur v ival.  We  woul d,
 no, no....  I never  
drea mt  of going bac k t o Pol a nd or
 to my cit y where I 
wa s bor n, Sl oni m, to go
 ba ck there an d meet 
people .  It wa s so far a wa y a nd s uc h a di ffere nt  
life that nothing really 
mat erialized.  The--so I 
belie ve i n 1945, I  al wa
ys mi x up the  years, 
'45 and '4 6 so, but ....
 
 
You were liberated i n '45?
 
 
In '45, after the war.  I was then 
considered as a Pol ish 
refugee.  All  the r e fug
ees  were  all o we d t o  g o 
bac k to Pol a nd si nce Pol and wa s under the Russi an ru
l e  a nywa y s o the y  did not ma ke a fuss .  So 
what  happened was t hat  
we  came back to Poland so we travel
ed by train fr om Samarkand back to 
Poland and we  came to the city of Wa rsaw .  Th
at  was t he capital  of Pola
nd .   T here  we  were  pu t  
into a bi g gatheri ng pl ace and fr
om ther e probably we were supp
ose d t o be dis pers ed t o other 
places.
 
 
At that point, did yo
u know what had happen
ed?  Did anyone know?
 
 
We hear d t h at--well when we
 came back we 
saw a lot of destruction, phys
i cal destr ucti on.  I r eally  
did not know at t hat poi nt the ma gni t ude what ha
ppe ne d.  I di d not know ab
out the camps.  That I  
learne d l a ter  whe n I  was  wi
th the Jewish organizatio
ns i n t he  ki bbutz.  Bu
t I must say I was very 
naive, I knew very li
ttle.  It was just a question of survival.  If you coul
d--there was a point where 
you could s t eal  a  pi ece  of brea d or
 outmaneuver some body, you wo uld 
go for it.  I really, in those 
days, never kne w what wa s reall y go
ing on.  I  had no i dea .  But  whe n
 we ca me bac k  to Pola nd, t o 
that gat heri n g place, ther e was a f
eeling of--t he y start to call us  Zyd which is Je w in Polish and that  
wa s a derogatory remark.  Some how 
the  Je wi sh  k i ds  were  not  wel c o me d  th ere.   Th ere  wa s  a  lot  o f  
bad feelings.  That I do
 re me mber that Je wi sh pe ople , t hey
 woul d cal l the m me ss enge rs, woul d 
come a nd fi nd out who is a Je w be
cause a lot of the Jewish kids
 the n di d speak Yiddish a mong  
themselves or they knew
...   Beca use s o me how, I belie ve , wh
en  I was  in Sa mar ka n d, t he Je wis h 
people  the re  were  not what t he-- w ha t I woul d c a
ll the  moder n J e w or t he  sophi sticat e d J e w who 
forgot t heir Judaism. because am
ong ourselves we did know Yi ddi
sh.  At least my uncle spoke 
always  in Yi ddis h t o me  and my 
aunt  and the people who wer e ar
ound me .  So  those people fr om 
eastern Europe, we still knew
 Yiddish.  Wi th the kids 
that I was back in Pola
nd, it was very easily, 
we  could be very easily detected
 that we  were Jewish kids, okay
.  So  as a resu
lt of that, the 
me sse ngers, the Je wi sh me sse ngers t r ied t o se par a te
 us  and ta ke us a wa y, steal us a wa y from t h e  
Polish authorities.  In those days, 
in 1946, I believe, th
e Jewish organizations 
started to blossom in 
Pol and.  As  the pict ure  i ndic ates , I  joined a  ki bbutz.
  At that  time, I was taken to the city of Lodz  
and there was a lot  of 
Jewish acti vity there.  That  
wa s a  st eppi ng pla c e  for  us 
to travel to Palestine. 
The  food was good, Fri day ni ght  
we were singing traditional song
s.  They taught
 us a  lot  of 

traditi onal  s ongs and t he r e was  a  renewe d spiri t -- it 
was  a ver y  good fe eling 
then.  We  were happy, 
we were able to sing, able to e
xpr ess  ours elves and t here  
was  some  ki nd of feel
 t hat  we ar e on th e 
way--away from Pola
nd- -to be a mong the Je wi sh pe ople .  
So I bel ieve we we
re about 150 kids , 
gathered fr om all over.  Some of
 the people knew Hebr
ew, we were taught alittle bit of Hebrew and 
a lot of Hebrew songs.  
From there we were on--I 
think we were about six 
mo nths in Poland and we 
were traveling illegally throughout
 Europe.  So we trav
eled fr om Poland to 
Czechoslovakia, fr om 
Czechosl ova kia we  came  to Austria,
 from Austri a to It aly and we j ust
 pa ss ed thr ough t hos e plac es . 
In Ital y was the st epping-- was t h
e gathering pl ace for the i llegal mi
grat ion tr avel s t o Palesti ne ,  
Israel .  Here a ve ry i mpor t ant t hing ha ppe ne d that 
cha nge d my whole  li fe  a gai
n.  On the way to the 
sout her n por t  of Ital y, t h e city was Bari , B-a-r-
i , some how I  got sick.  
The y c oul d not ta ke me  
because they--I'm sure they did 
not have the accommodations since 
everything was 
illegal.  I was 
take n bac k t o Rome  and all of 
a sudden I was not an
y mo re among my  own 
pe opl e.  The n, oka y 
what ha ppe ned was, a s l o ng as  I  
was  i n t he  ki bbut z, I wa s prot ecte
d fr om the outside elements.  By 
that I  me an nobody el se
 had aut horit y over  me .
 
 
Wa s t his  done by t he  Joi n t or  by t he Hechal utz?  
 
 
The Hechal utz moveme nt w
ith t he cooperat ion of th
e  Joi nt and t he Je wish a gencies  to ha ve us , 
whoever was in char ge of t he aliy
ah.  I really don't know.  But ev
er ythi ng wa s or ga niz e d.  We wer e  
fe d good, we  were  gi ven clothi
ng.  There wa s al wa ys pe ople  
to show us the wa y and ...
 
 
Do you re me mber any i n divi dual s or any na mes?
 
 
No, I wo uld not know.  I do
n't know any name s.  But 
all I know is that  once I start in the kibbut z,  
we were wel l  take n care of.  And e v
e n though we  ha d to 
travel by  fo ot to a 
lot of the places, like 
fr om Austria to Italy, we
 traveled by foot illegall
y through the borders...  
The way I understand this  
is that the borders 
were-- the border gua
rds or whoever the au
thorities, they were 
taken care of so  
we could go through.
  That was a fa ct bu
t it was still illegal to
 go through all of 
these places but we 
ma na ged t o go thr ough.  Li ke  I  
sa y,  whe n I wa s  with  th ese  peo ple , I  t hi nk  we were  1 50 , I  wa s  
prote cte d fr om t he out si de e l e me nts , mea ning J e wis h
 or anyt hing el se.  A
ll of a sudden when I 
came-- when I got  si ck and 
I  ca me  bac k t o  Rome , I  was  vul nera ble  
to the outside peop
le and this is  
where I  change my li fe to
ok pl ace.  Because 
what  happened t h en was that
 t he religious people, t he 
religi ous  groups , like Agudat  Yis rael
.  You see  i n  thos e da ys, e veryt
hi ng you ha d to
 belong t o  a  
group.  You had to 
bel o ng whether  it wa s t o  th
e le ft  or  t o the  right, or  to t he  orthodox gr oups  
beca use  I be l i eve e ver ythi ng wa s re gis t ered and the  
groups or t h e ass ociat ions woul d re ce ive mone y 
to support  you.  So all  of
 a  sudde n, out  of nowher e, 
some  people came  and they
 started to talk to me  
and gi ve me  food a nd gi ve me proba bl y mone y or 
whatever and make me feel
 good and tell me  that 
I shoul d go wit h t he m.  All of 
a sudden I was i n  an or gani zatio
n , Ag ud at  Yi srael  whi c h wa s a n  
orthodox gr oup.  I  sta ye d 
with them fo r awhile.   
They prepared me in t he 
orthodox wa y of life and 

they also said that they
 were going to Israel.  
But to them, Israel was no
t as important politically  
spea king bec ause  thos e peopl e tri ed to migra te t o
 t he United St ates, a lot  
of them to Israel.  
 
 
But they were all based in
 Rome?   Eve ryone was...?
 
 
In Rome and the y wer e in ot her 
out s i de pl ace s of Ro me.  They fu
nctioned quite we ll.  So I was 
taken to t hat place and a fe
w mont hs l ater, I was actuall y--I was in
 t he Agudat Yisr ael i n Li vor no, i n  
sout her n probabl y a bout 100 mile s a w
ay fr om Rome.  It's  al
so on the coast.
  That 's where t hey wer e .  
The n I was t ake n back to Rome a n
d I wa s put into a yesh
iva.  The yeshiva as 
you can see fro m th e 
pictur es was also made out of re
fugees fr om Pol and, Hungar y, Ruma
ni a, Czechosl ovaki a.  Most of  
thos e pe ople  were  the rea l  Hasi di m fr om-- who sur v
ived the wa r and from 
wa y back.  Because eac h 
one  belonge d t o di ffer ent Hasi dic  gr
oups  li ke to t he Gerer  and t he  Sat mar .  Since I  cal led mysel f a 
Litvak, I  ha d not hing t o  do wit h
 the Hasi dic mo ve me nt.  But I wa s in the yeshiva be cause that 's 
wh ere I wa s taken in.  Somehow, as 
soon as I was taken in to the 
yeshi va, I reme mb
ered the very 
first thing they did to me 
is they cut my hair.  As 
you c an see in the pict ure , 
that was a total di fferent 
style of life  and after a while th
ey called me a shaygitz
[gentile boy] because 
I did not confor m to 
their wa y of life.  I did not w
ear the tzitzis outsid
e  and I  did not  ha ve  peye s  and suffere d.  
Anyways...
 
 
That  ma kes  you a  s haygi tz?
 
 
Oh, yeah...  Ok ay.  Fr om the yesh
i va what  happened was
--t he y sta rted--oka y t he y as k me i f I  have  
relatives in the United Stat
es.  I  said yes because 
ever ybody has rel atives.  
So they took my  name  
and t hey spr ead it, I  t hink 
it  wa s in t he  ne wspa pe rs.  As  a  mat t er 
of fact , they send 
my  na me  li ke  in  
those days what happened was--n
ames of survivors appeared in 
the Jewish newspapers like th e 
For w ards  a n d Der  Tog a nd the  M orgen Journa l, i n 
all the papers.  Here of
 all t he  na mes I  ha d an 
aunt  here i n  Bost on, Dorches t er t hat  was r ea d
ing, went  thr o ugh the na
me s a n d  sa w my  na me .  
Reme mberi n g that as a mai den he
r na me wa s the sa me wa y, so sh
e put t wo and t wo toget her and  
some how c o rresponde nc e st arte d.  
I am a nephew--I was recognized 
as being part of
 the fa mily. 
This is interesting be cause my 
gr andfat her  had 14 chil dre n wit h
 two wi ves, okay.  He  had ten 
children with the first wife
.  Mos t  of thos e c hildr e n 
came to the Unite
d States in the 
early twenties, 
okay.  The youngest of th
e aunts whom I had here 
left my father who was 
a little child in Europe. 
My father  was the youngest child fr om the second 
wi fe .  So  of the 14 child
re n, he  wa s t he  ver y  
youngest .  He hardly knew any
--I would say t hat i f t hey would 
have met hi m, 
they coul d not 
recogniz e hi m t hat it is  t heir brot her.  The y s end 
me a pictur e, they send a pict ure t o  Italy i n the 
yes hiva  of my pare nts  and I  di d r ec ognize  that t he y 
were my parents.  So th
at was  pr oof that I  a m a  
Milkow.  Then what happened was 
t h ey start ed t h e proceedings for  me
 to come to th
e United States.  
Okay, the  ye shiva  was  100%  
i n favor for me to go to
 the United States rather
 than to go to Israel 
and j oin the old ki bbutz .  As  far  
as t h ey were concerned,
 I should have totally 
for gotte n my pre vious  

associati on wit h t he kibbutz becaus
e they were not orthod
ox and so forth.  No
w what happened was 
that, oka y, here are  a not her  tur n of e vent s ha ppe ne
d a nd t his  I just  rece ive d pa pers , docume ntati on  
that  it r eall y- -even t hough it  happened but  I  ne
ver  ha d any pr oof.  What  ha ppe ne d wa s the ye shi va  
as a unit came to Canada.  
 
 
Wh at was the name of the yeshiva?
 
 
Ye shi va Me or Ha gol ah.  The Light of the  Dias por a.  
Oka y?   I coul d have gone  
with them as part of 
the yes hiva and the re woul d have  be en no pr oble m. 
 However, my rel atives 
wanted me to come to 
the  Unit ed States, okay.  I wa s--s o what ha ppe ne d, 
the  ye shi va  mi grate d  in 1948 a s a  unit t o  Cana da , 
Montr eal .  I re mained 
in Italy.  Once agai n, you 
see, that 's the se
cond time  I wa s le
ft  o u t .   O n ce  I  
was left  out because I got sick an
d I coul dn't go wit h 
my ki bbutz  and 
now t he ye shi v a le ft and I  
re mained i n Italy but  under t he supe rvisi on of ot
her orthodox groups who 
were in touch with the 
yeshiva.  I was still 
under their domination.
 
 
Ho w wo uld you _____domination?
 
 
Whate ver .  Anywa y, but  me anwhile
 a lot of correspondence wa s go
ing on from the relatives who  
lived i n  Bos t on to Ca na da, t o  It
aly to get me into th
e Unit ed St ates.  We
ll, the United States 
consulat e re fuse d to gi ve me  a visa
, okay.  Some body de ci
ded that the best thin
g for me would be  t o  
go to Canada and from Ca nada I'll 
go t o t he Unit ed Stat es.  The y
ear  was  already 1949, t he end of 
1949 a nd most of the re fuge es w
ho lived in refu gee camps in Ital
y a nd t here we re hundreds a nd  
thousands of  them migr at ed, eit her 
t o the Unite d States or to Is rael or South Africa , whe rever .  But  
there were al ready---
 
 
The y were cl os
ing the quotas?
 
 
Right , t hey wer e c losi ng the  bor ders .  It subsi ded. 
 I was the refugee where i n
 '46 and '47, you could  
see hundre ds  and thousands.
  All of a  sudde n, eve r
ythi ng be ca me  s mall er. 
 Ev erybody tried to get 
out  of Ital y and find a place.  Well , 
I am still  in Ital y.  
So what t hey decided 
i s for  me t o  go t o  
Ca nada and fr om Canada 
I  woul d go to-- mi grat e t o
 my relatives in the Un
i ted Stat es.  Well , i n  
1949, Dec e mber 1949, I  arri
ved in Cana da by s hi p. 
 I  came t o the yeshiva.
 
 
You did it  al l by yoursel f?
 
 

Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.  
But the Jewi sh agency, the Joint and th
e IRO took care of 
that.  Actually 
also the relatives, at  this point, I think had to co
ntri bute  some  ki nd of mone
y or whatever.  Oh, yeah, 
I tra vele d, I  wa s ver y sophist icate d
.  I mean, there wa s no problem.  
 So I came to Canada, I was in 
the yeshiva.  And within a we ek or
 so, one  of my cousins  ca me t o  vi
sit me.  This particular people--
(a)--they were very prosperous i n
 t h e United St ates.  They had-
-so and I woul d 
say they were 
sophisticated.  I mean they were pr ofessional busi
ness pe ople .  The y ca me  
t o Ca nada a n d they sa w 
me .  So me h o w ,  fr o m th e 
i mage that  they had of me , befor e th
ey saw me, an
d the i mage t hat t hey  
had of me  a nd t he e nvi r onme nt t hat I wa s in was  
a total different picture,
 oka y.  All of a sudden, 
they walk in.  They saw the Hasi
dic move me nt a nd t hey sa w me an
d I bel ieve t hat somehow, they 
lost their appetite.  They 
tried desperately, maybe th
ey lost their appetite fo
r the environment that I 
was in rather than the ap
petite for me, I'm not sure 
what happened.  
But they tried de
sperately to get 
me  out of Canada to the 
United St at es.  They were
 not  successful.  And I was in Montreal unt il, I 
believe, May 15.  They took me  ou
t fr om the ye shiva and they set me  up fr om the Je wish agency, 
Jewish Children and Family Service 
in Montreal and they even send 
me to a public 
school.  And I  
was living with a--like a 
privat e fa mil y, okay.  Th
en a s I  was doi ng t hat , t h
ey were working for me  
to go ba ck t o Ita ly.  Yea h, I k
now it's strange.  Anyw
a ys , on May 15, the y deci ded that I shoul d go 
bac k t o It aly.
 
 
Who decided this?
 
 
The  cousi ns.  Bec aus e  fr om Cana da , I wa s  unabl e  t o
 come to the United Stat
es.  I had to wait to 
bec o me a Ca nadi an citiz e n a nd t hen go t o t he  Unit ed
 Sta t es .  Suppos edl y, I  wa
s supposed to go back 
to Italy for two week
s and everyt hing was arranged in Ital y 
for me to come di rectly to the United 
State s.  Well , ne edle ss t o say, 
this never materialized and two 
wee ks pa sse d and a mont h pa sse d a nd  
anot her month pa sse d.  And I was s t uck in Ital y.  I  coul dn't go bac k
 to Canada bec aus e I onl y had a  
two- wee k  vi sa  so I  coul dn't  go ba
ck t o  Cana da , I c oul dn't  c o me  t o
 the United States.  From that 
period of ti me , lett ers and docu
me ntation wa s  writt en.  It  we nt 
as far as t o the Congr essma n 
Chr i stia n He rter wh o l a t e
r beca me  t he governor .  
I have a  whole  bunc h of
 letters proving that 
ever ybody worke d on my 
be hal f a nd nobody c oul d do anyt hing.  We ll anywa y
s, fi nally in August 
15, 1950, I  c a me t o  the United Stat
es.  And basically, a 
wh ole new chapter star
ted because I came to  
the Unit ed States and I was not pr ep
ar ed for my fa mil y.  I woul d sa y 
that not that I was not prepared  
for them, they wer e not prepared 
for  me.  I had five a unt s a n d un
cles here.  Th e youngest was 65 
and over.  I had a cousi n
 who was in her sixties.
  Her mot her--I had an un
cle here who was i n t h e 
nineti es .
 
 
Ca n I  st op the ta pe and fli p
 it  over for  a second?   
 
 
 
Okay, go a h ead.  So anyw
ays, when I came t o t h
e Unit ed St ates, somehow 
I don't think the fa mily 
really know wh at to do with me
, how to ha ndl e me .  Th
e  si mple reas on is, t he y we re  uneducat ed, 

they still were reading th
e Jewish paper.  Okay, 
what happened is
 some were--two 
families were 
real  ort hodox, the  ot hers  wer e not  and there  was  
a clash between them and 
their own chil
dren.  The  
childr en st art ed t o  move away fro
m--what I call the Jewish
 ghetto, s el f-i mpos ed Je wi s h ghet t o, a nd  
move out a little 
bit to suburbia.
 
 
Thi s is all  in Massachuset ts?
 
 
Thi s is all i n  Mass achuse tts, yea h.  As you know
, the Je wi sh people li ve d a mong the ms elve s.  So, 
they reall y di d not know what t o do
 with me.  Some sai d 
for me to conti nue l ife
 like I--t o send me t o 
New York t o a yeshi va and 
continue ther e.  
Some wanted me  to be the 
all -Amer ican boy and go t o  
public  sc hool.  I  wa s t or n  bet wee n t he m beca use  I  
wa s goi ng t o  one  uncle 's  place  a nd I  did not  have 
to wear  a yamulka.  Go
ing t o  a not her  pl ace , I did have  t o  
wear a yamulka.  
For Shabbat, the  
orthodox fa mili es wa nte d 
me to have the m 
with me  be ca use they di dn't
 trust the other family and  
then the cousins who work
ed all of that--t o get me  into the Un
i ted Stat es--they di
d not agree wit h  
anybody.  Finally, t he e nd r esul t  wa s that  I was  
put into--- with a Je wish 
Family and 
Chil dre n 's  
Service in Boston and they took care
 of me .  I was put into a small children's home ; there were  only 
about 20, 25 kids
.  Mostly from natives who 
lost t heir  pare nts  or  the parent s we re divorce d or  
whate ver.  So I  was  put  i nto t hat  ki
nd of pla ce.  I  believe  I sta ye d at
 least a year.  Th
en I  wa s put  int o  
a foster  home.  All of thi s, t he 
children's home and t he fo
ster home was within 
the peri met er of my  
uncl es because everyt hing was in wa
l king dist anc e.  So he re  I  had 
an uncle two bloc
ks away on one  
side , t wo bl ocks  a wa y  on the  ot her  si de  and I  live d 
with fo ster parents and 
in bet we en.  So I  c oul d 
walk over to one family, walk over to th
e other fa mil y but  I could not s lee p over.
 
 
Did the Jewish Social Se
rvices take over because 
there was so much
 fe uding with the family or..?
 
 
Yes.  Well the cousins saw 
to it . Act ually- - pr oba bly t he y me ant go
od.  The c ousins s a
w to it that I 
really di d not ha ve  a  li fe
 a mong my a unts  a nd unc les
.  They were so di vers if
i ed, li ke  I said.  The  
orthodox people really did not know
 what to do with me.  And t
hose who--traditional but like the 
uncl e  wor ke d...   By t he  wa y the  uncl es  were  mar rie
d to my f ather 's si ster s 
so t hey were r eall y the  
outsi der s.  And so I l i ve d 
wit h t he fost er pare nts...
 
 
You were about  what  fourteen or  
thi rt een years ol d at t his ti me?
 
 
Ye s, some thi ng like  it , ye ah.
 
 
What  sc hool ing... now 
I assume  you didn't have schoolin
g when you lived 
i n Sa mar ka nd..?
 

 
Okay, let 's go back to 
sc hooling.  While I  was i n  
the chil dren's home i n Sa
markand, I think we did 
have some kind of sc
hooling there.  I remember 
very little of that. 
 It was--we did not
 go to a formal 
school .  Probabl y t he  sc hooling wa
s within the children'
s home itsel f.  We di
d know Ru ssian, some  
Polish and I really don't 
know how for mal it  was .  Now, until  
on the  way bac k to Pola nd,-- oka y.  
Whe n I  was  in t he  ki bbut z, I  le arne d s o me kind of
 He bre w  and probabl y mo
stly Zi oni s m  be cause  I 
would hear  words  li ke  J aboti ns ky ( p h)(c.684)  a n d I  
know about  M ena chi m Be gi
n in Italy.  So ther e 
wa s no for m al 
e duc ation, no.
 
 
No  math and science 
and things like that?
 
 
No, no, no.  The n when I  
came to t he yeshiva, a
ll I learned was the Siddur
 and Humash and all  of  
that kind of stuff.  But de
fi nitel y not hi ng to do wit h mat h or sci e nc
e.  As a matt er of act , an i nci dent  
happe ned that I kne w how 
to rea d Yi ddis h.  Once  
while I was in the yeshiv
a, I pic ke d up a book , 
which at that time I did not rea
lize i t , but it  was  a boo
k by Me ndel e M oche r  Se
fori m.  And when I 
looked at it, first of al
l I  associated t h at seferi
m i s  se fe r whi c h woul d be  
orthodox.  Be cause they 
were talking about seferi
m so I t hought it was a n
 ort hodox book a nd I wa s rea ding it.  The n I  
showed it to some of th
e boys in the yeshiva and next  time--and 
I was very proud of
 it.  Ne xt, I wa s 
called to t he rosh ha yes hi va a nd he sta r ted t o hit  me 
in my face.  And start to
 yel l  at me , how dare I  
to read books that
 are forbi dden, forbidden 
books.  I couldn't reason 
with them and there was 
not hing to re ason.  I me a n, t he y kne w what t he y  
we re tal ki n g a bout s o t hen pr oba bl y...  The mo re 
they were i n  their beliefs, the mo
re I was in my belief 
that I--t he opposit e wa
y.  No, okay--when I 
ca me i n Ca nada for t hre e  mont hs , I  was going t o-- I 
was a fourt h gr ade r  bec aus
e I have a report card  
to prove it.  I  di dn't e ve n r e me mbe r
 that.  I did good in ma
th but  I di dn't do good
 in any of the other  
subj ects .  Li ke I was suppos ed t o t ake Fr enc h a n d 
Engl ish and all of t hat ki
nd of stuff, I didn't do 
good.  Engli sh I  did bett er than 
French, okay.  Then wh
en I came to the Unit
ed States, I  came her e  
in August, 1950.  From 
1950, Septe mber 1950 t hro
ugh probably J une  '51, I we nt t o a pr epar ator y 
school.  And then in 1951
, I wa s put  into a regula r hi gh sc hool
.  So I  we nt  thr ough the ma ndator y 
four yea rs of high s chool and I di
d gra duat e  fr om high school .  I di
d good through the four years in 
math, I did good.  As  a ma
tter  of fact , one year  I  got  an A i n  al
gebra and stuff like that so I did good 
in ma th.  I  t ook Ge r man, I  did go
od and I took La
tin, I did good.  Be cause 
Latin wa s the closest to 
Italian, so I was abl e to 
do good in t hat...  Ameri
can hist ory, I coul d not unde
rstand.  a. I coul d not--I 
wa s unable to understand 
the i nner worki ngs of the A merican hi
story and t he la ngua ge wa s hard s o  
I di dn't  do good in t hat  s ubje ct.
  But I  did gra duat e and while  
I was  i n high sc hool, I  ha d an 
aft ernoon job and I wa s  
wo rki ng .  An d whi l e-- a nd t he n--I 'm 
t hinking-- -six year s--s o in 1954 I  
entered the Hebrew College.
 
 
In Bo ston?
 
 

In Boston, in Brookline.  An d I wa
s--t ook me two years in the high 
school instead of four years and 
four year s in the c olle ge progra m. 
 So in si x years ,  I gra dua ted the 
high sc hool i n t wo years a nd the  
college i n four years.  So ther e 
I ha d a good He br ew educati o n.  On
e  ye ar , in my ju
ni or year , they 
send me  for a year to Is
ra el to st udy.  So that
 wa s good, I  like d  that .
 
 
Did you ever go look up
 your  ki bbutz people?
 
 
No, I  di d not.  I  had no i d
ea, I shoul d have, I  should 
have.  Because at  t hat 
ti me, I  still  coul d have 
probabl y l oc ated the m.  But, hone st ly s pea king, 
in 1958, I  wa s very ins
ecur e of mysel f , very  
insecure.  By then, 
I had lost my association with the family
 here .  M ost  of t he m died, t he  c ousi ns  
hardl y kne w me a nd eve r ythi ng that
 I did, I  di d on my own.  So a s
 l ong as I  was sti ll in school , 
especiall y  in t he Hebrew college, 
I felt I wa s among my  own people,
 who in a way understood me . 
I could expr ess mysel f wi
th them, I also had sp
ent about ten years in 
Ca mp  Ya vn eh
 which is 
asso ciated with the He brew College.  I worked th
er e i n  the camp and that  
was very good fo r me  and 
the people accept ed me.  I reall y
 was ver y--I li ved with peopl e who 
were not r elati ves even though  
they were very good to me
.  Ever ything I di d, I ha d to do on my
 own.  The best thi ng t hat  I deci de d 
whi c h  wa s r eally  a gai nst  my
 family was to go to the 
Hebrew College.  Some of them want me to be 
the all- Amer ican boy and forget Ju
dai s m and for g et eve r yt hing else a
nd I felt that t hat was a part of 
me.   So I did go to th
e Hebrew College and I di
d graduate and until about 
two years ago, for about 
thirty years, I managed to
 teach He brew school. l fe el l took as
 much a s possi ble  a n inter est  i n  
Je wish li fe  a s I could.
 
 
You-- basi cal ly Hebrew teach
i ng be ca me  your  ca re er?
 
 
Ye s.  The only problem
 is that you don't ma ke a livi
ng out of it, okay. 
 So as a result 
of that, I had to 
wo rk to ma ke a living and 
for the past  25 ye ars , I 've be en in 
t he same place.  Th
e c o mpany ac cept ed  
me  for  all  my mi sh ag oss  th
at  I  ha ve  a nd e verythi ng 
else.  And I've been with
 them and th
ank G_ _, I 
was able to make a living 
from the m and support a fa
mil y.  I didn't sa y a nythi
ng about the fa mi ly so 
I'll say a few words about the fa mi
ly.  In 1963, I got  marr ied.  
We  ha ve bee n--I 've be en ver y  
fortunate  be caus e  I  ha ve  a  ver y  good wi fe  and t w o ve
r y  ni ce  c hildre n.  And th
ere is a lot of fe eling 
bet wee n us.  It was , I bel i eve , th
at married li fe was go
od for  me  be cause I fe
lt that I did belong to 
something.  The important thing 
is that I can shar e my-- towar ds-
- wit h s o me body a nd--the pr oble m s  
wa s tha t  when you gr ow up by yours e
lf and you share ever ything wit h 
yoursel f a nd t hi nk of li fe as  
an i ndi vi dua l so a s a--and t hen being--you see  th
e important thing 
was you have to 
be , you ha ve  to 
belong to something.  If
 you ar e a unit by yourse l f
, you don't  belong to a n yt
hi ng.  So being marri ed 
wa s the right thing and it lasted
 and it's good.   I hope it
 continues and ________.(c.809)
 
 

Gla d t o he ar  it.  Ca n I as k you ag
ai n to go way back?  Ar e t here any 
i ncide nts othe r th
an the life in 
the  chil dre n 's home  i n Sa mar ka nd or anyt hing tha t  
happened in Uzbekistan 
that you can reme mb er?  
Epi sodes  or  t hings t hat
 sta nd out i n your mi nd?
 
 
We ll, the episodes that st
and out in my mind are li
ke t his .  Eve r ythi ng was  
very re gi me nted in t h e  
children's home .  Be fore that, my  un
c l e--I  us ed t o  visit  hi m.  I  don
't re me mb er how my aunt died. 
She di ed before my uncl e and I r eal
l y don't have too good a r ecolle ctio
n of her .  Wi th hi m, I  ha d, I  
believe, a cl oser  associat ion.  So 
while he  was in the hosp
ital, I would go in ever
y da y t o visit  hi m. 
And we  would sit and we wo
uld talk.  Wh at I 
know about my  pare
nts is what he to
ld  me .   He  wo uld  
say to me that, I remember, the wa
y he s aid it is .....He would say it,
 of c o urse , in Yiddish, not t o  
forget.  I remember 
he  would sa y. forge sh nis ht  mi ne ki nd ( c
.830)   He would in
dicate to me--he 
wo uld let me  know that we
 ar e her e  in a place, that
 it is a temporary place an
d i f  and whe n I  get  out 
of t he place to re member  what  ha
d happened.  He had a 
feeli ng that  he was not
 going to survive. 
Every day, it 's very --- he
 was a man t hat wa
s not a tradi tional Jew in th
e shtetl as we woul d pi cture 
to be.  In other words, 
i f you woul d neglect  t o  go 
on a  Shabbat  t o  ser vice s, 
it woul d not  bot her  hi m.  
But  he  was  very nati onali stic and he
 knew he  was a Jew.  He spoke 
Yi ddis h e ve n though he  was , all  
his life  working with th
e gentiles and trad
ing wit h t he m.  I  woul d sa y hor se-tra ding but he  kne w  
what he  was .
 
 
Do you have  any pict ures  of thi s uncl e ?
 
 
No , I don't, no I do
n't have a nyt hing.
 
 
The chances are sli m...t hat 's t he thi ng.  
 
 
No, no, no,--because wh at happened
 wa s fr om Samarkand, I did not 
bring anything with me .  I don't 
eve n ha ve  a n y proof that  I  was  i n  Sa marka nd.  The  
only proof is --t
hat  I  wa s  in Sa ma
rkand is what  I 
re me mber.  The  only pi cture s that
 I  ha ve is  when I was i n the ki
bbutz and they t ook the for mal  
pictur es i n t he kibbutz  of eac h indi
vi dual  and t he group pict
ur e.  That st art ed my pi ctur e coll ecti on. 
As  a  matter  o f  fact ,  whe n I  was  i n
 the yeshiva, t h ey confi scat ed th
e pict ur es.  And for a long, l on g  
ti me  I  did not ha ve  t he m.  Fi nall y t owards  the  e n
d when t hey were alr ead
y a wa y, some body ga ve 
them to me.  The relative
s her e in t he United St at es are all fr om
 my fat her 's side, you s ee.  I was 
fr om all the relativ
es from my  mo ther's  side so
 I survived, it's 
funny, I  s urvi v ed be
cause her relatives 
took me  away.  And ye
t I came to the United States with my--t
he  whole  fa mil y  is  
fr o m  my  fat h er 's  
side .  I do re me mber that  in the 
children's home, they w
oul d beat us a l ot a nd we  would do a lot  of  
stealing.  Li ke if you w
ould have an e xtra  pie ce of bre ad or  wh
atever , you would kee p i t unde r your  
pillow.  Then you would go
 try to pick it up
, it  would be taken away 
so one would steal fr om the  

other .    We  would also go in gr
oups from the natives an
d steal things like to
ma toe s or  eggs  or  
wh atever that you could eat; or grap
es, the y ha d a  l ot of gra pes  t here .
 
 
We re you hungr y all  t he t i me?
 
 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  But if
 you would get  ca ught  by
 the natives, they would 
beat you up badly.  If 
they would bring you i nto the chil
dre n 's home, the n  you would get 
a  double dos e a nd t he  aut horiti es  
would beat  you up for going t o  
the natives.  Somehow I do rememb
er t h at t hey woul d emphasize 
that Samar k and was the city t hat 
Alexander t he Great was t h ere.  
I r e me mber t hey woul d take us  
sometimes to the mountains,
 because ther e were an aw
ful lot of mountains.  As
 a matt er of fact, t h e 
buil ding t hat  we were in
, was a one-story l ong bu
ildi ng, made out of cl
ay.  And I--it 's funny--I 
re me mb er th e mattre sse s.   I re me mbe r  the m tak e n  out .  I  d o n ot re me mber  a di nin g r o o m, a pl ac e  
where we were eati ng.  So I don'
t ha ve too much of a 
-- of Samarkand.  In 
Pol and--oka y let me go  
bac k t o my parent s.  I n Poland- ---
 
 
I as sume  the y wer e orthodox?
 
 
Okay, oka y.  My pare nts- -the wa
y I under sta nd--t hey were poor pe
ople.  My fat her , being a baker - -
oka y what I re me mber is
--  Th at mu st have been in
 1940 or '41, be
fore I came t o my
 uncle because I 
came ther e i n t he summerti me, 
my father  worked in the barracks for the Russians because the 

Russians came there in '39.  What 
woul d ha ppen is we  would- -I t hi
nk whe r e we  live d  we ha d one  or  
two rooms at that time. 
 Now I don't  know i f it was beca use  of 
the  war  or  ma ybe i n
 1939, we  live d  
somewhere else, that I  don't re me
mber.  But  we had only t w o s m
all rooms and he wo uld wo rk a 
whole da y a nd at  ni ght he woul d 
come;  or whenever he would co
me, he would bri ng some bre ad  
wit h hi m.  The br ead, most of 
the time, would be like 
broke n in piece s but 
it was something.  And 
then we would share it with the 
people who lived around 
us.  I think wh ere we  
lived at that time 
wer e li ke  bar r acks ,  I woul d c all it  now
.  I don't know if it 
was -- I 'm sure  it  wasn't
 of t heir  own choice  
but I  do not  know whe t her be fore  19
39, they ha d a bet t er plac e or  in
 1939 they ha d 
t o r un a way and 
came....  But  I feel t hat
 they were like in barrack
s.  I re member the pove
rt y t here and I  remember  
hi m goi ng t o t he--c omi ng ba ck wit h bags of br
ead and we would all  shar
e it .  I  re me mb er  my  
mother going to the mark
etpl ace .  I n  those da ys you had ope n 
mar ket places, t hat  they would come 
and sell stuff .  Looki ng at  the pict ur
es, I could see t hat t hey wer e tro
uble d pe ople .  Anot her thi ng is -
-also I  feel  t hat  my father was not  
too mu ch of an educated ma n.  For 
inst ance, here is 
a card, that is 
Milkow, oka y, a nd her e is the city
 of Slonim, see that, Slonim.  Th
is is in 1940, that's the only 
pictur e  that  he  se nt  to Dorchester
.  Of cour se  that was the uncle 
I came  to.  This is in Russian, 
written in Russian.  Now judging fr om
 that, fr om the pictur
e of my father and mo
ther that they had 
sent  to t he  Uni t ed State s, pr oba bly t hat  part icul a r 
pi ctur e was mai l ed i n t he 
40's .  That partic ular  
pictur e  of my pare nts  wa s--you c
oul d se e  on their  fac es--t he y wer e 
not --I  me an i f you look at the  
face, you could see t hat t h
is is a disturbed man, ok
ay.  Because an earlier pict
ure I ha ve  of the m, an 

earlier  pi ctur e of t he m, you c oul d see  he wa s  bett er
 dressed.  And somehow, yo
u see this is what I  
studi ed.  No hair , so he 
must  ha ve  been--l ooks  li ke
 an ar my pictur e.
  Where here  he did ha ve  ha i r  
and you c oul d see that a disturbe d f
a c e.  So al so t a king a pi ctur e like t his , it  coul d be that this kind 
of picture was a  doc u me ntation pict ur
e for t he aut horiti es, okay.  So-- -t
his is the grandfather, this is  
one of his sons.  Now I  wa
nt t o s how you here, I k
now it is visual but--this 
is--look at the beautiful 
writi ng.  I want t o show you ev
en i f--see I have i n herited---t
his is a beauti ful handwrit ing.
 
 
That 's  your  father?
 
 
No, no, t hat 's my gra ndfather .  My father , I show
 you, he wa s not--l ook th
i s is  hi s  ha ndwriti ng . 
Okay, t his i s my fat her's handw
riting, which i s  not bad but----.  Se
e t his i s a cl assic.  This 
handwriting is a classic.  I showed
 it once when I went 
to the Hebrew Colleg
e and I showed them 
this.  They were all  ast oni shed beca
use  you know t he...
.  This is before, this is also Slonim. fr om my  
fat her  Lazer  Milkow, he spells it 
here wit h an F.  But i n 193_, 
I  cannot  make ou
t--- but  in 193_..

Thirt y-one ,l oka y.  So 
that was  Pola nd, oka y.  I don't know--
Wh en I was able--the
 relatives they  
gave it to me.  Actual
ly I took it from them
 and I  kept  it  all  t he years.  
So basically this
 i s  what  I  can 
tell you.  I realize it is not...
 
 
Do you know t heir  a ppr oxi mat e date s of bi
rth?  Do you know 
how old t hey were?
 
 
I ha ve  no i de a.  I don't  
even know my  own.  I 
have no idea.  I wi sh...
 
 
So thi s woul d be you?
 
 
We ll, I don't know.  I don't 
know if this is me .  Ri
ght, I don['t  know when this
 picture was taken.  I  
think I  ma de  a  c opy of thi s
.  The original  
one was....  Here's  th
e origi nal  pi ct ure.  
See I don't know.  -
--It says Sloni m.
