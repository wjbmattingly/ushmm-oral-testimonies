ISAAC BITTON 
May 17, 1990 
 
 
Q: Would you tell me your name please?  
 
A: Yes. My name  is Isaac Bitton. 
 
Q: Where and when were you born?  
 
A: I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, March 31st, 1926. I was born in the hospital at Hiletia
 in 
Lisbon. 
 
Q: Tell me  about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family. 
 
A: My...my mother was born and raised in Farouh in the south of Portugal. And...uh...most 
of the Jewish people that came to Portugal towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of 
the 1800s...uh...settled down in Farouh. And there was a very large community lodged 
and relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. By the 1900s they all 

disappeared so that Portugal...uh...Farouh today is...there is no Jewish life. But my 
mother was born there. She moved to Lisbon with my grandparents which originally 
came from...uh...uh...Morocco, Spanish Morocco and French Morocco. Therefore, my 

name  Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name . Uh...And of course my 
mother was ma rried in Lisbon and...uh...we were 
five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys 
and 5 girls and...uh...I attended...t
he uh...the...uh...the schools in...in 
Lisbon...and...uh...the Jewish school...was a private Jewish school...uh...where we were 
taught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could 
read...uh...the prayer books. Because my 
family came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. Not orthodox, but...uh...religious. 
And we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. At home my...my grandparents, 
primarily my grandmother spoke some  Spanish and...uh...Lidino
 actually, and some  of 
the Portuguese. And...uh...basically, I...I grew up amongst the Jewish community which 

was very, very small at that time. There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth. 
There was actually not too many youth i
n...in Lisbon, Portugal. And...uh...my oldest 
brother had actually begun to have some girl
 friends, not Jewish. My father was very 
upset about it and...uh...as I used to go to school to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also 

was a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...living room several pictures 

of...uh...of...uh...of Israel, of    
 Israel at the time from the wailing wall and others. 
And...uh...I was always impressed by those pictur
es. Always! And that created in me  a 
great desire at the time to...to go to Israel. Already from a little, early childhood. And 

suddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to Israel. But in the 

meantime, my Aunt Esther        
 Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was 
a Portuguese soup kitchen primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of 
Lisbon. And during the second world war, obviously this kitchen became  very very 
influential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day. And it was there that I 

really began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

impressed by the various languages spoken. Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a 
little bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of 
Yiddish...uh...lots of German...uh...Hungarian, Czech. I reme mber families from 
Czechoslovakia. Uh...I was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and 

uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangeme nt. There 
were probably within the dozen tables...uh...each table would care approximately 
hundred...10... 10...uh...people so the dining room for the refugees was within...uh...150 

persons sitting capacity. And there was another small dining room which was for the 
Portuguese...uh...the Portuguese community. And next to the kitchen, soup kitchen was a 
Jewish hospital. I was born in a Jewish hospital. So was my entire family. It was a very 

small hospital, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community. 
So...uh...and...uh...it was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at 
the soup kitchen I hear...one family walks in...several children, father and mother...very 

well dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really 
very nice and neat...uh...and I...I asked the gentleman. I said...I fact I told him, "Excuse 
me . This...this is for the refugees...this dining room.ﬂ And he said...uh...uh... ... in 

Portuguese...he said, "But we too are refugees.ﬂ And...uh...I couldn't quite understand it. I 
was a teenager at the time, but still...uh...I asked him, "Why is that you are refugee. 
You...you are Portuguese. How can you be a refugee.ﬂ And...uh...he asked me  to sit 

down. And it was then that I...I me t the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. -
                   
  
 who told me  that he was the ex-consul of Portugal in Bordeaux, France. And he went 
on to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he 
had refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish 
refugees. And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. He was 

disbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps. 
And...uh..I me t him in Lisbon at the soup kitchen within...I do not reme mber exactly if he 
was 4 or a half a dozen. We  spoke briefly. He was there in line standing with...uh...family 

to get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't
...I...I never got out of my mi nd simply that 
the..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives, 
was punished in such ma nner by being removed from...from his...doing his job. 

And...uh...I was very impressed and these image always stayed with me . Uh...I...I...I don't 
believe I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short 
few times. But I reme mber portions of the family. And...uh...uh...I reme mber the...the 

refugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate 
ones that had received visas by Dr. in Bordeaux, France. Uh...I reme mber a family by the 
name  of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most 

busy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu
. In fact, it was burned out recently. Was 
on the portions of the city that was burned...ancient part of the Lisbon. And...uh... Mr. 
Deutsch used to put...uh...a table about ma ybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and 
other little things. And I help him bring them to the areas. I used to help also to bring the 

refugees to some ...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon 
and I was quite familiar with Lisbon. Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name  of 
Goostave
 Zumi ch
...Zumich
. He was from Czechoslovakia. Uh...Uh...He was a 
shoema ker, and he set up shop...uh...at the soup kitchen, one of the corners. And there he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

would repair the shoes from the refugees. And...uh...I reme mber Mr. Brown who was 
also a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the 
Jewish...uh...Portuguese community. He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them 
to...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me  at times, why...why don't you 

show this person where such and such a street is and so forth and so on. And...uh...I 
remember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman
, who...uh...uh...whose lady 
had...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill. She was 

hospitalized in Lisbon....uh... for I believe was me ntal stress. And my Aunt Esther, God 
bless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she 

was hospitalized prior to moving to Israel. Later on, since we traveled on the same ship to 
Israel...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in Nahariyya in a little farm, 
which I did. That's how come I arrived in Nahariyya. It was through the Grallman
 family. 
And...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I reme mber of the...uh...the...uh...the 
incidences...you know, you are a young ma n and...uh...up to that point in time in history, 
life in Portugal as such and Lisbon was quite uneventful for a young ma n. 

And...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come  in...uh...it was very exciting. I 
could not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they 
would come  to this soup kitchen a little before noon. If it was an hour before, and they 

would...in groups...you could sit them right in the...uh... the         
 and           
 in Lisbon is 
still today a street that has no end, you know. It...is two little corners like. You must turn 
around to come  out. And...uh...they would walk around there, talking about problems, 
families, the anxiety, what happened to other members of the family because they did not 

know. They hadn't heard from them. Uh...And...uh...this to me  was all very exciting 
and...uh...as a ma tter of fact, it reinforced in me  even more so my wants to...to go to 
Israel. And...uh...it was at some point in time that we met...uh... members 

of...uh...the...uh...Sofnut
 that came from Lisbon to ...uh...uh...help the refugees to 
immi grate to Israel.  
 
Q: Could we hold it for a second?  
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Can you give me  a picture. We 've moved fa
irly quickly. Give me  a picture of what 
happened. What was Portugal like when the war broke out?  How was it different from 
what had happened before?  
 
A: During the second world war?  
 
Q: Yes. When...for you. For you! 
 
A: Forme ?  
 
Q: What did you see. Besides the refugees, when the war broke out, what changes did you 
see. What was your...was your life any different?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

A: Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time 
during the war that in the north of Portugal, they had found wolfrum
. And that's some  
type of a metal. I do not know that much about it. But it's sometime of a metal that you 
must mi x...uh... with other me tals...uh...specifically for armory. And, of course...uh...that 
became very, very exciting all over Portugal. And many people just left the town and 

went to the north to try to work on the wolfrum
 mi nes. And, of course, being an 
adventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go 
and dig wolfrum
 too. So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful. 
No sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to Lisbon because, of 

course, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. And...uh...however little money we 
had...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted 

that I did not make a million escudos
 on the wolfrum
 mi nes. But...uh...that was an 
exciting thing. And as much as life generally speaking in Lisbon at the time for as far as I 
can remember...uh...other than going to school at the time, I...uh...being a member of a 
large family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the 

Portuguese printing department of the Portuguese governme nt. And he certainly did not 
earn that much money either. So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help 
the family. So, other than school, we would 
pick up whatever job we could, me  and my 
brothers. And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I 
mi nes and...uh...we had a little wrench. There must have been a million bolts and nuts in 
these mi nes, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. Uh...Another job that I 

took was...uh...working on ships by derusting the ballast of the ships. You know, if you're 
familiar with the ship ballasts, they'r e little oval holes at the bottom of the ship, and you 
go in with a little swimmi ng suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your 

arms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the 
rust that accumulates in these little cubicles,  You know, they'r e very small cubicles. 
Uh...That was another part of a job. And I did other mi nuscule jobs and working 

on...uh...helping to ma nufacture of...uh...bicycle, painting, etc. And...uh...by and large, 
the...uh...there was an exciting period in Lisbon. I reme mber the...uh...uh...there would be 
a...practically every day in the newspapers some  story about some one being killed. A spy 

or...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...in Lisbon. And there is another thing that I 
used to do with my friends. We  used to go to the German Consulate. And they had 
always literature. Tons of literature! They would give away propaganda about Germany. 

So we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the mome nt we 
were out we used to toss it out in the garbage. So...uh...this was one of the things that we 
did...uh...for some  obvious reasons...uh...actually. Another one function that I 

had...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...horse shoe shop. He was a big, big 
ma n and...uh...he couldn't read or write. And...uh...he always...whenever I came  back 
from school, it was my function to come  to him and read to him the newspaper and what 

was happening in the world. Because I used to like to read a lot. And...uh...and some how 
or another we...we became very good friends, you know. And here was this big fellow. 
He couldn't read. I could never understand why he couldn't read either. But he was an 

older gentleman. And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his shop. Blacksmith?  I

don't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going 
every...we had to go every night to the temple because my father...uh...my father insisted 
that we go to the temple every day...every night. You cannot come  home unless you've 
been to the temple to the services. And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays, 

we used to go to temple. So we conducted a reasonably...uh... I would say a moderate 
Jewish life. And...uh...our house was...was, of course...uh...kosher. My father was quite 
kosher. And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five 

girls. Although two of them were born...I
...one girl...my youngest sister, Rachel, was 
born after I left Portugal. And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. And my 

brother, Jacob, was...uh... few months ol
d when I left for...for     
, Israel. So... 
 
Q: Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in Portugal once the war...once the war had 
broken out?  
 
A: My only me mories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of 
the Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or 
anything like that. Never had that feeling while I was in Lisbon. That's the truth. 
Uh...But...uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mi xed with the Jewish 

refugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really 
to go to Israel. Number one, to go to Palestine and to join the British Army, and go and 
fight the Nazis, which I did as a ma tter of fact. 
 
Q: Tell us about that. You started to say...you had started to tell us about the Sofnut
. Tell us 
about the refugees and    Sofnut. 
What happened?  
 
A: Certainly. We ll, once we...uh..we...uh...we le
ft Portugal, our first stop was... 
 
Q: Excuse me . We  have to back up. If you would please, tell us why...you were now in 
Lisbon. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the Sofnut
 came to Lisbon.  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Tell us what they did and tell us what you did. 
 
A: Well, basically, the...uh...uh...as far as I can remember, they came in to...uh...help number 
one, to bring all the children...refugees children primarily were the number one to go 
on..uh...on the registration to go to Israel. And then came grown-ups. So families with 
children, of course, were the first ones. And they asked the Jewish community also if 

there were any members of the Jewish community in Lisbon that wished to immi grate 
to...uh...to ..to     
, Israel. And I...I and my brother were the first ones to...uh...join. Uh...In 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

fact...uh...I must say that my father at the time did not like the idea that we were going to 
leave Portugal. But I told him that I wanted to go to Israel. There was no Jewish life in 
Portugal, no Jewish youth. There was no girlfriends. At 16 a young ma n wants to have a 
girlfriend. And...uh...there was no such thi
ng. And...uh...there were...there were, of 
course, ma ny girls, but not...not Jewis
h. And...uh...I...I..I had very, very strong...uh...will 
that I wanted to marry within the Jewish faith and have Jewish children as well, and 

continue my Jewish life. That was really something that I always had since childhood. 

And I think as I me ntioned before, I was very much impressed by the...uh...photographs 
from the...from       
, Israel, the wailing wall, etc. And Musrabano
 and other pictures that 
the teacher had on the wall. So we then registered with the governme nt of Portugal. We 

had to pay some  fees to...uh...so that we wouldn't have to go to the military, etc., 
and...uh...we left for Palestine. I do not reme mber the exact date, some times end of 43 

aboard the ship Niasa
...was a steamship, a Portuguese steamship. And...uh...there was 
several hundred children and adults, refugees. And...uh...our first stop was about a 
day...within a day, we stopped in Cadiz, Spain. In Cadiz, Spain, the ship picked up 
several hundred Jewish children again. And it was there that I me t...uh...a fellow from the 

Jewish community in Lisbon. His name  was                  
 who with his brother, Samuel, 
were in charge of the...uh...uh...uh... removal of Jewish children from the border of 
France into Spain into Portugal and into Israel. Uh...Again...uh... knew very well...uh..Dr. 
because apparently there were visas some received from this gentleman through           
. 
Okay?  So that was the last time that I saw               
 alive. He and his brother worked for 
the Jewish community of Lisbon in conjunction with the American Joint Committee to 
save the Jewish children. So...uh...we (clearing throat) we went to...uh...we...uh...went to 
Israel or to Palestine. 
 
Q: Excuse me . Tell me  about the ship. I would like to know what it was like for you on the 
ship with the refugee children and what you did. What effect it had and there was an 
incident that you had told me about. 
 
A: Right. It was...I cannot reme mber the name s of this young ma n, but...uh...uh...as a matter 
of fact in my life, I was directly and indir ectly involved in saving five lives. But he was 

aboard the Niasa
, that...uh...the first thing that happened was...the Niasa
 had to take a 
large deviation because of the second world war as it was in...at that point in time quite 

active, there was...the...the specifically, the German...uh...uh...U-Submarines were in the 
Mediterranean and as a result, we had to...I only remember that we were advised that the 

ship would have to ma ke a deviation because of Germany submarine activity. 
Uh...Although we...we...ourselves did not see any submarines. But we did pick up a time 
when there was very, very rough seas. And people, of course, were feeling not quite well, 

and everybody was running up to...to the top even though they were not...you were 
advised not to because it was reasonably dangerous. So I was going up to the deck 
and...uh...a young child I would say within 10 to 12 years old also was in a hurry 

apparently to relieve himself and...uh...he was caught by a wave. And...uh...don't ask me  
how. I only know that I dove to this child and I was able to grab him while I was 
grabbing myself also to the rails. And meantime his mother was very...uh...excited and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
7
 
 
 
she called the father which was a little further below the steps. And...uh...he came in a 
hurry too and to help me , and we brought, you know. This...This takes a few seconds 
because here comes the wave and...and...and just came through the deck and there he 
was. And I grabbed him and so we came down there and there was no water any more or 

anything. And the father....I will never forget it. Uh...He jumped at my feet, and he 
wanted to kiss my feet because I saved...I saved his child. Now, you know, it's one of 
these things. You know, he could...maybe he 
would never gone overboard, but he could 
have gone overboard as well. So...uh...I do not reme mber their name s. I do not 
know...once we landed in Israel, I don't know whatever happened to them because they 
went in different directions and...uh...uh... But nevertheless, life on board ship for the 

approximately 1 week that we spent that normally would take within 3 to 4 days, but it 
took a little longer because of that...those deviations that...uh...the ship had to make in the 
Mediterranean...Mediterranean. But we...uh...landed in Haifa. Life was not that exciting 

on board. You know, it...uh...people would sit again in corners talking about what 
happened, wishing, willing, what happened to the families, etc. in...uh...in...uh...in...uh... 
Also, sort of type of permanent...permanent...uh...anxiety. That's the only way I can 

describe it, you know. There was I would say...uh...many sighs of relief when...when the 
word Israel, the land of Israel. I remember that when all of a sudden they say land, land, 
land. And there was Haifa     
 Israel. That was a word that was very, very striking to 
everybody. Because everybody...all you hear at that time was Israel, Israel, and I could 
not understand what they were talking about. It was Polish or Yiddish or German. But 
you could hear all the time Israel, the word Israel. That I remember. We were unloaded 

into a...uh...buses and imme diately brought to...uh...it was some  sort, if you wish, of a 
concentration camp in Atleit
. I don't know within 10 to 15 miles from Haifa, south of 
Haifa. And...uh...I asked, "What are we doing in here? "   It's like a concentration camp. 

Barbed wire with security police everywhere...uh...Arabs, Jews, British. And...uh...the 
camp was divided into two sections for...one for me n and one for wome n. And later on 

we found out that...uh...because or due to strong activity from the Fifth Column...the 
German Fifth Column they had to do a series of interviews and they asked everyone and 
they checked the papers, etc. So we stayed in that Atleit
 within...uh...a couple of weeks. 
The conditions were not the best, but they were fair. The Sofnut
 was there to help us. 
And...uh...from there on, most of us were moved to a little...uh...a little quarters outside 
Haifa by the name  of               
. And there was worse because the conditions there 
were...everybody was mi xed, me n, wome n, children. There was no beds. We ...uh...they 

didn't expect apparently that large number of people at the time and they were not 
prepared. And...uh...as a result we slept for a few days on...on the floor with blankets, etc. 

Then...uh...the...the youth were moved to a camp in Carmel
 in Haifa, the                           
. And it was there that...uh...I had the great privilege and the honor of meeting the great 
lady of the Youth Alijah
 Movement, Henrietta Solt. 
And she was a lovely lady, God bless 
her soul, who...uh... I talked to her personally too. She talked to each one of us, 

welcoming us to        
 Israel. And...uh...some of us we were already above desirable age 
to stay in the Youth...with the Youth Moveme nt. And I was one of them. So I then was 

moved from the                      
to Kibbutz BitAlfa
. And here I must say that...uh...I could 
not get used to life in a kibbutz. I just couldn't. Uh...I was too...uh...you know, full of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

action, you know. And...uh...I wanted to join the British Army. I wanted to join the war, 
not...I didn't come  over here to be in a kibbutz, you know. So my brother, Abraham, 
stayed in the kibbutz and my cousin,                
, God bless him. He also passed away in 
Israel. Uh...They...they stayed in there. 
And...uh...I went to...uh...to join the British Army 
in Haifa, the British Joint Office. Uh...Once 
I filled all the papers, I was advised that 
because when they asked me for my papers, I gave them my Portuguese passport that I 
arrived legally. So I was advised by the...by the lieutenant in charge...he said, "I'm sorry, 
Sir. You can't  join the British army. Portugal is a neutral country.ﬂ So I said, "Okay.ﬂ I 
left and I joined the...at the time was in Haifa talking to some other friends in there, I 

joined the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad Division. And this time my cousin also 
joined. He came back from the kibbutz also. He couldn't ma nage there. And...uh...so we 
both joined the PPRD. But I did not like the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad 

DIvision. What we did was simply night guard s. We had to be with the rifle or the 
carbine by the railroad or be escort to the British...uh...payroll, etc. And it was not what I 
wanted. I wanted to go to war. That was my ma in thing. So I decided to...uh...go to 

Sarafan
, which was the largest British joint group...army...uh...camp. (clearing throat)  
And again I fill out the papers and...uh...when I was asked for my...uh...uh...papers...how 
did I came to Palestine, I said, "I haven't got any papers.ﬂ How did you come in?  "I'm an 
illegal.ﬂ And I wrote in this time in my...in my...my papers that I was born in Sofia, 

Bulgaria. As a native of Bulgaria, of course...uh...Bulgaria was at war too, so was no 
longer neutral (clearing throat) and...uh...speaking to some other friends...uh...we 
realized, of course, that the British they speak English. And not once was I asked about if 

I speak Bulgarian. Which I don't! But...uh...so...it was in this manner that I was able to 
join the...the British army. So we spent some time in Sarafan
...the camp, and then we 
were moved to the Jewish Brigade group...uh...training camp in...uh...Ismailia
 in Egypt. 
We  were part of the ITD...the Infantry Tr aining Depot. And, of course, we were trained 

by British...uh... officers and also by...uh...Jewish officers. So we spent several months in 
training in infantry accelerated training because at the time the British army...the Jewish 

Brigade group because they wanted us to have a very fast training. The Jewish Brigade 
group had seen some  action in the front in Italy at the time. And...uh...of course, I never 
saw any action in the front. The end of the war came while I...we were still in Egypt. 

So...uh...we were then moved to Europe. We  left Alexandria aboard a British troop 
carrier, Escanya
, if I reme mber right, and from there, of course, we were designated to 
the different...uh...Jewish Brigade...uh...unit. I was assigned to the second battalion of the 

Jewish Brigade group. And shortly thereafter, 
I was transferred to the corps of military 
police of the Jewish Brigade. (clearing throat)  And we saw duties in Antwerp. 
We  had 
our main station in Antwerp
 in Belgium. And it was there that...uh...I really had some 
first impact with dispersed persons that...people that came from the camps. Not the 

refugees that were able...that were fortunate to run away and arrive in Lisbon some how in 
a reason...reasonably healthy manner. I'm talking about a dispersed person that survived 

the camps. They came out. They were skin and bones. Okay?  And...uh...as a me mber of 
the Jewish Brigade, our uniforms were part of the British...uh...uniforms. The only 
difference was that we had our patches 
and we had the Star of David in gold 
with...uh...two whites and...uh...uh...blue...uh...stripes and...uh...it was in Antwerp and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

used to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came  in. 
They came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where 
they came from, but...uh...it was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw 
the Star of David, there was one of the most     
 things I ever experienced in my life. They 
came to you, and they kissed the Star of David. And they was saying in Yiddish,               
   
. They didn't believe that. And it was very, very touching. So I spent some time 
in...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a...uh...R and R 

camp. We  spent some  time there. And...uh...of course, this is after the war. 
Uh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially. 

Unofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or 
part of it or portion of it were very, 
very...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to 

another place. It remi nds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like 

a duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below 
water they peddle like Hell so to speak. And that's what was happening. The...uh...the 
Jewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assumi ng in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the 

Aliyah Bet
 and I'm sure you know the meaning of Alijah Bet
. Uh...There was the 
convention immi gration and the unconvention immi gration. And the unconvention 
immi gration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet
. Uh...so that it would be 
distinguished from the convention immi gration. Because the British mandate, at the time, 

in Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come  to Palestine on a 
variety of grounds that they believed in. 
But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency 
believed in...in otherwise. And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas. And as a 
result, the Alijah Bet
 was created. So...uh...there were ma ny a times that...uh...in our 
camp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was 

several...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the 
camp. So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen 

tents wouldn't mean much of anything. Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that, 
you know, leave them along so to speak. They are dispersed persons in these tents. The 
reason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British 

government...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with 
the assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of 
Palestine not to allow any Jews to enter. And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but 

to try to evade their...their investigations. Where are the Jews comi ng from?  Where are 
they being loaded?  On what ships, etc., etc.?  What ports, etc., etc.?  So...uh...that's when 
the Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the 

refugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's 
from...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc. So this involveme nt 
actually was...uh...ultimately was found out some how, and the British governme nt, of 

course, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade.  
Q: We re you involved in any of this?  
 
A: No. I...I was not directly involved. No. 
Not at all. No. I was only by...by virtue of 
being...of serving with the Corps of Military
 Police of the Jewish Brigade. I do know 
that...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...a
rmy vehicle had a log. And in this log, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
10
 
 
 
of course, you have to write the mome nt you leave your camp, where you going, who is 
for, dut dut dut da. So...uh...they used to..to wr
ite in their logs when they were moving 
refugees three letters in English. T-T-G. And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew, 

Arabic, and Yiddish, which means              
. Which me ans if...if you pardon me , up your 
rear end business. That's what it meant. The reason that they wrote TTG on their...on 
their...on these log sheets was when and if they would be stopped by some  of the 
Allied...uh... policemen on the frontiers, etc....uh...when the read, if it's British police and 

they read TTG on it, that sounds...even though it's a Jewish Brigade convoy...20 convoys 
or 30 vehicles, etc...uh...they're not going in to see what's inside. Fortunately, for us, they 
wouldn't because if they would have lift the
...the gate, so to speak, you'll see that there 
was wome n, children, refugees being moved around. From one port to another port, etc. 
So this part was very exciting. I knew it about it. I was not involved directly with this. 
Uh...I was indirectly involved because, for instance, after spending some time in Europe 

in the British Army in the Jewish Brigade group, you are entitled to a vacation home. So 
an Isaac Bitton, in fact, went home on vacation. But the real Isaac Bitton never left, 
simply because the...uh...again...the...the Jewish agency had trained younger men, 

refugees to be able...how to hold...uh...the           
 the way the British army does or way 
the Jewish Brigade does. How to eat, etc. etc. Uh...Some Hebrews words in the event 
they would be questioned, but otherwise they went home on vacation. They never came 
back. They stayed there. But Isaac never left, say Antwerp, either. And then suddenly Ike 

is back from vacation. You understand?  And...and the other Isaac stayed in Israel. So in 
this manner, many refugees also arrived in Israel with...uh...with 
false...uh...army...uh...army papers, army documents. So that's the only time that I was, if 

you wish, indirectly involved with the Aliyah Bet
. Uh...of course, the end of the Jewish 
Brigade came about 1946. We  were dismissed. And we went back. And it was prior to 
living in Antwerp and that one evening I...uh...I
 took a...uh...an electrical train in the city 
and to my great surprise, there was Brigadeer Benjamin. Brigadeer Benjamin was a....was 
a British Jew who was comma nding the Jewish Brigade group. And it appears that he had 
never been informed officially of the underground activities that the Jewish Brigade was 
doing at the time in Europe. And as a result he...uh...he was just totally demoralized if 

you wish, prior to the...to the...when we all 
left...the Jewish Brigade left Europe. And 
Benjamin would be just...I saw him more than one occasion walking around in town. But 

I met him personally in the electrical train. I had to salute, of course. He was a Brigadeer 

General and...uh...but we didn't speak. He was a very, very reserved ma n at that time. So 
I do not know from there on...uh...I never heard that he went to visit Israel or even if he 
ever went to Israel, but he was very upset about the whole thing. Uh...But the 

meantime...the ma in...the ma in...the ma in point was to save and bring as ma ny Jews to 
Israel as possible. And that was something that the Haganah did...uh...the Alijat Bet
 did 
very well. And...uh...so we were disbanded, discharged pretty much. We  went to Egypt 

again, and from Egypt we were...we stayed in some  camps for a short period of time and 
we went to...we were discharged in Sarafan
 also officially and...uh...received our 
civil...civilian garments and little bit pay, etc., and we were free men again, so to speak. 
Out of the...out of the Army. Out in the streets. And...uh...imme diately, when I went back 
in Nahariyya, of course, we joined the...all of us joined the Haganah underground 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
11
 
 
 
because the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine. 
The...uh... (clearing throat)...when it came to...was the beginning of the...uh...the 
problems...the...uh...the...the war, of course, if
 you did not travel in a convoy, then the 
chances of going from a place A to place B alive was...was very difficult. And...and it 
was here that I came quite involved in the...in the underground...in the Haganah 
between...uh... primarily between Haifa and Nahariyya and the We stern Galilee
. We  used 
to meet convoys going south in Shavatsion
, a few kilome ters south of Nahariyya 
and....uh...and take as ma ny cars as possible and...uh...in each one of the vehicles was at 

least one person, one me mber of the Haganah which was arme d. Now if it was a girl...it 
was many of the girls that...that were also armed or if it was a boy...either if he were 

sitting on top of the truck or in the bus or in the car or in a motorcycle, etc....uh...that was 
a safe way for us to travel at the time. And comi ng back in the late afternoon...early 
evening during the daylight, we would...uh...we would all congregate in the           
. , you 
know, next to Haifa, and because between               
 and Haifa was reasonably safe with 
the exception of the refineries in which...uh...there was a very, very...uh... very serious 
incident. Uh...One time...uh...the...at lunch time, a car went by and while all the Arabs 
and even some Jews that used to work in the refi neries were sitting outside having lunch, 

some body threw some  bombs. Uh...As far as I can understand...uh...of course, the Arabs 
blamed the Jews. The Jews blamed the British. And...uh... the facts remains is that the 
Arabs were so angry...uh...at this attack that the massacred every Jew that worked with 

them. For years, they used to work together. For years and years! No matter how...all of a 
sudden, bingo. I don't think there was...if there was a half dozen Jews that came out of 
alive of the...Haifa refineries. They were all ma ssacred. And on the same  evening, the 

PALMA
 by orders of the high comma nd of the Haganah took action, only with cold 
arms, no hot arms...they went into the Arabic village right outside Haifa...uh...where most 
of these Arabs came from, and they...they really fortunately enough...there was no me n 
on that evening in the village. They all had escaped because they knew 

that...that...uh...the Haganah was after them. I do not know exactly what...what happened 
after that, but the...the fact remains that it was a very...at the beginning of the war...the 
war...this...of the problems. SO we...we used to congregate in Keathim
, and from there on 
again we used to travel all together to...uh...to...uh...Nahariyya.  
 
Q: Excuse me . Did you see the results of any of this PALMA or the fighting?  You were not 
there? 
 
A: No. No. You mean at the...uh...at the...uh...the refineries. 
 
Q: 
 
A: No. No. No. But I tell you one time...on two different occasions, I arrived late to the 
convoy, and I lost the convoy. Once was going south. And I was alone. No...I beg your 
pardon. I was...I was alone, and then I picked up a fellow who was a mechanic, Heim 
Yenkel
, was his name ...was a mechanic in Nahariyya. And he sat next to me , and we 
worked to the city of Akko, but he was uneventful. There was no problem. However, on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
12
 
 
 
another occasion comi ng back when...when just shortly before the war really started and 
things were getting a little tougher...uh...several people had been killed in 
Akko...that...one by a...in a motorcycle. They tried to cross Akko alone, so to speak, by 
car, by bicycle, and they never made it. So one time I arrived...uh...a little late, and my 

wife, at the time, was pregnant and I...I...I had to go, get home. And...uh...certainly, I 
always had a gun with me, a 45 pistol liberata
, Italian hand gun. But...uh...since I was 
driving at the time a Volvo...it was an old truck, and I had on...on my truck I 

had...uh...flour for the bakery, and a variety 
of other products. So I took my Arabic...uh... 
head dress which I used to carry with me because since I'm quite dark featured, I could 
pass very easily as an Arab. I put my head Cafia
 on and...uh...when I arrived at the gates, 
they had this...we called this Spanish donkeys...is barbed wire on...uh...cross...uh...horses 
you know. And we used to call it Spanish donkeys. And...uh...when I came to the city of 
Akko, the entrance to this...to this gate, I just put my head of the...my cab, and I shouted 

in Arabic, "          
.ﬂ "Open the gate. Open the gate.ﬂ And the...the guy looked at me  and 
opened the gate and I just kept on going, and I was never stopped. But...uh...you can do 
these things when you are 20-some . (Laughing)  Today, probably I wouldn't do that. 
Uh...I was very fortunate too, but...uh...then, of
 course, the...uh...the war began pretty 
much very quickly, and...uh...I was...uh...with the....I was with the Fish
 in the Haganah, 
and then I became...uh...Sergeant Major in the Israeli army, and I was pretty much 
stationed in the western Gaililee, in Nahariyya and in north. But at the beginning of the 
war, some thing that some times people wonder, "How did you do it. How...How did Israel 

deceive them.ﬂ Now, you are attached by so ma ny armi es surrounding you, and how did 
you do it?  One of the things that we did, we excavated roads between Nahariyya 
and...and...uh...frontier of Lebanon, which was about 7...5, 7 kilome ters north of 

Nahariyya, and...uh...we excavated in a zigzag for miles up to the road where was the 
Kibbutz Hineta
, so that one evening, by comma nd of the Haganah, we took every car, 
every bus, every motorcycle we had. Now there was no arms at the time other...other than 

the Haganah itself. There was no army at the time. That was before the...the great 
shipment of Czechoslovakian arms came to Israel. This is all before that...that period. We 

took out all these buses...the things with full lights and we drove toward the frontier. 
Okay?  And so if you are sitting on the top of the mountain and you're looking down like 
the Arabs were at the time at the frontier of Lebanon in Israel, whoever...there was some 

army there. Of course, not...nothing of any 
great numbers but there were some . And 
they'r e looking down and you see all these lights comi ng in. They would say,                    

 
. "The Israelis are bring the entire army over here.ﬂ Well, we did. We drove with lights 
on. We  turned around underneath the mountain where they could not see. There was 
large growths of...of olives, and we turned around and came back without lights. And we 
turned around again and came back with lights. You know, in with lights on, back 

without lights. And we did this for a given period of time. But for your information, there 
was only one time that we found out that it was a few Arab tanks that came  down from 
Horshineka
, Russ, and 
Nicura, down into the section of the road to Hineta
, and they 
turned around and back they went again. They never dare to go beyond that point. And, 
let me tell, if they had there was nothing to hold them like I said. So in this case, the 
Haganah...uh... used a lot of...of strategy of faked...uh...moveme nts which was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
13
 
 
 
successful in illuding the enemy at the time...uh...from advancing, because they did not 
know what was expected from...from them. And...uh...but...uh...at this point in 
time...uh...I'd like also to talk to you about an experience just very, very shortly before 
this...the war started, there was a convoy going to Yesshiam
, Kibbutz Yesshiam
. 
Yesshiam
 was the name  of a young ma n by the name  of Yesshiam 
Vis, 
 who was a me ter 
of the PALMA, special forces of the Israeli...uh...Haganah. And...uh...Yesshiam Vis was 
amongst the detachme nt of...uh...PALMA that involved in operation bridges. In 1947, the 
Haganah decided to build, to blow up every br
idge...every bridge that was connecting at 
the time the land of Israel so to speak and all the other Arab countries. 
And...uh...so...uh...it was very effective. The ma in purpose, I understand, 
was...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves, and also some  sort of 

a warning also toward the Arabs, you know, that..."Don't attack.ﬂ It didn't ma ybe work, 
but said don't attack us. Leave us alone. Let us be. Unfortunately, there is a legend about 
the...the...Yeeheim Vis
. The bridge they were supposed to blow up was in...uh...was 
called Asiv
, which goes back to the Finnishian
 times. It's a little bridge. 
And...uh...uh...the legend is that...uh... the...uh...from some  Arabs later on we found out 
that there was a group of British army...uh...soldiers. There was a British army camp not 
too far away from Asiv
, that...uh... was...apparently, they were doing some  sort of 
ma nuevers in the mi ddle of the night unbeknown to the group. And as a result, they were 
ambushed. Since every...and each of one these young me n carried the...the dynamite, 
explosives with them. Uh...There was...not a thing was found from them. Absolutely 

nothing! They just disappeared. Was about 8 if
 I remember correctly. And today there is 
a me morial to...uh...Yeeheim Vis
 in Asiv
 by the bridge. And...uh..before the war, there 
was an American...as a ma tter of fact, an American group of young me n and wome n that 
built a kibbutz in Asiv
, by the name  of Asiv
...Ame rican...I was there on the 
commemoration with General Adror
 at the time. But in the meantime the... 
 
Q: We need to stop at this point and change tapes. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name  of  
Yeeheim Vis
. His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency. 
So...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially comi ng 

in from the mountains...uh.. So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two 
kibbultzes. It was just shortly before the war started. And one of them is name d, today, of 

course, Yeehim
. I'm quite familiar with the area because  Yeehim
 if you go back 
to...uh...to several years ago, used to be called                 
 in Arabic. And there was an 
Arab...a very, sort of a stronghold. But it was abandoned. There was no one there 
actually. And...uh...so the Sofnu
t decided to build a kibbutz at                
 by honoring the 
name  of Yeehim
. And...uh...this was done. Next door was built another kibbutz 
and...uh...uh...uh...I believe was Gotton
. I cannot quite remember the name, but I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
14
 
 
 
remember that I was there at the time. And this kibbutz was built already under 
fire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...it was a very...it was a very excitable 
day because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making 
food, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the 

Mountain of the...the Tree Mountain. Because was in above the higher level. And...uh...I 
can't  remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree 
because there was a large tree there. And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz 

Yeeheim
 came about, to honor Yeeheim
 Vis
, basically. And we used to go...uh...prior to 
the war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and 
food to kibbutz   Yeeheim 
. We  used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to  
Yeeheim
 because you go up to the mountains and you have to walk to             
, and you 
had to bypass small Arab villages and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much 

and you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise. If you 
had...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 me n and the officer, 

uh...we...uh...we used to have different squads
 going to different areas. And...uh.... also to 
make a mock attacking, attacking  Yeeheim 
 because we expected there wwould be 
problems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there. And there were ma ny 
problems. They were...they were attacked ma ny times. But...uh...obviously, the attacks 
could not come  from the    
 because there was no shape, or form that as you were 
climbing this...this...this high mountain, bi
g so to speak...uh...you always ma de noise, no 
ma tter how careful you are. You could hear it. You could hear it way a way before you 
were...uh...inside. They could hear the noise already. So basically that's what happened 

in...the     
. And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a 
convoy where I lost my...my very best friends. I used to live at the time...shortly before 
that I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman
. And...uh...there was two boys 
and a girl. Moses, Alisa, and Salome  Shinerma n. And...uh...There was a convoy at one 

time. an armed convoy...that's when the conflicts already had started in 
19...uh...beginning of 48...uh...that...uh... they took...it was a bus and several trucks, and a 

pickup truck. The pickup truck had a...had a device like in V shape that had a wheel and 
this device would be lowered to the road and it would push any any stones that the Arabs 
used to block because they used to block the...the roads all the time. It was very easy to 

do. You throw in a few large rocks and no car can by. Uh...Interesting enough, the road 
between Nahariyya and Nefriam
...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very 
zigzaggy. And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the road of backshis
. The...uh...backshis
 is 
an Arabic word for tipping. And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came  

to Palestine, the...uh...when the British mandate were building the road...that particular 
road... uh...which was quite parallel to the...the Lebanese border so to speak...uh...every 

Arab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British 
backshis
...the would make the road came to their gates, so they could come with the 
trucks and as a result the road went like this. That...that's a fact. And...uh...so as the          

  
 came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd, 
1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon. Uh...There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of        

           
, the known...uh...Arab liberator of Palestine so to speak. And he was very...very 
smart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
15
 
 
 
away through a...his own     
 road that he made to the Western Galilee. But nevertheless 
....uh...the attack on the convoy to          
 was quite successful simply because there was a 
serious of tragedies. Uh...Number one, the officer comma nding the...uh...the convoy 
was...by name  of...uh...uh...Ben Aame  
 if you heard about him. And...uh...my best friend, 
Moses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit. This was my unit. I was spared 

simply because my wife was giving birth to 
my daughter at that...a few hours before that. 
And because she was quite ill with a...with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that 
the doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there..he said, "Isaac, you 
must stay here.ﬂ And in fact he even talked to our comma nding officer, that I must stay 
there because they expected the worst from birth. Fortunately enough, nothing happened. 

But...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left 
even to the convoy. And...uh...I said, "Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow 
me  to go.ﬂ I had to stay there. So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...it was a few mi nutes 

after the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. Because they...they ...they waited until 
the...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks 
and they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown 

to them was able...was able to break the barricade. The second car in line was the bus. 
The bus had armor. The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy 
metal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt. Unfortunately, as the driver 

of the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some  of a molotov cocktail. 
And both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the 
road. So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the 

same ...the same  thing. They couldn't move. And as a result the...uh...the people were 
given the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. And... uh...very, very few were to...to 
survive this incident. Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows 

from the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the 
Mediterranean. There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there 
because in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. Had the convoy had left 

earlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...it wasn't  quite 
full summe r yet. And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and ma neuvering. 
Some  of them arrived in Nahariyya and th
ey...what...the next thing what happened was 
the British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine, 
they did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try 
to help, but they would not allow it. Could not live Nahariyya. And it was one of the 

greatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...in the Haifaam
...the convoy to Haifaam. 
Uh...We lost 40...49...I believe 49 me mbers. But then there was an action 

that...uh..some...some said in Israel later on there was a...uh...an action from the Haganah 
to ma ke up for the convoy to Haifaam. And what happened was one of the Israeli 
telephone operators caught up or intercepted a message comi ng from the Lebanese border 

that there was a convoy comi ng in with...at the time if you remember the British...the 
British had the Arab Legion in Palestine as well. And the Arab Legion had some  stations 
in the Mount Cumberland 
Haifa, if you reme mber. They had some ...so the...the Israeli 
intelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy comi ng in from 
Lebanon full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs. Let me  tell you, that I saw

personally. And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. For several days, the entire 
                                     
 all the houses along the main road Haifa Beirut were emptied. 
Now, the Arabs, of course, didn't know that. And there were several me mbers of the 
Haganah and the PALMA waiting in hiding because they...they knew that the convoy 
was comi ng but they did know when exactly...the precise time. And...uh...by sheer 

coincidence, I was not involved in...in any of those actions at the time, I just happened to 
come  to         
 with a truck which I is I...I used to bring food and all kinds of things from 
Haifa to Nahariyya during this period. And I just had arrived barely in Kayathim
... was a 
big, big circle. And all of a sudden, all Hell broke loose. This convoy had come  in with 

the arms at the other end on the north side of Kayat...uh...Kayathim...Kayat valley. 
And...uh...of course, it appears that not just there was several...uh...private cars, 
automobiles, sedans, and there was some  Araban Legion trucks. And apparently each one 
of them had some  sort of dynamite in it. Not only did they have some  dynamite in it, they 
also had some  officers of the...uh...the Arab Legion in it. So the result was, it was 

just...uh...very tragic for the...for the convoy, because...uh...no one came out of it alive. 
Not a single person! But what I saw and that I'll never forget in my life, for as long as I 
live. The British police and the British army...of course, they immediately 

surrounded...closed the roads. Okay?  And...uh...you could smell the fire. You could smell 
bodies burning. You could see the fires because we were right there. Okay?  But I'll never 
forget in my life is when the British...when all this action disappeared...several Israelis 

were also actually hurt because one young ma n from the Haganah, he just went the head 
of that truck and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army 
because he was the one who really went to the mi ddle of the road and just stopped that 

truck. He just shot everybody...whatever the truck as the truck was comi ng to him, and he 
himself in turn was blown up, and his face...uh...I can't  reme mber his name ...they had all 
the plastic operations and a year, etc., etc., and he was for a longest time hospitalized. But 

the point is...I wanted to ma ke, when I saw the British officers, British police 
with....uh...portable...uh...what do you call this...uh...when you put some body...it's ma de 
of canvas, you know. 
 
Q: Bodybag?  
 
A: No. Not a body bag. No. No. No. Uh...if some one is injured, for instance.. 
 
Q: Stretchers. 
 
A: Stretchers. I beg your pardon. They used 
to have stretchers. Okay?  And...uh...they would 
put a stretcher next to a body. Now that body...uh...those that I have seen...I saw at the 
time without a head, without arms, etc. They didn't touch the bodies as such. They used 
sticks, and with sticks they used to push the bodies into the stretcher. Okay?  And then 

they went like this...one...two...three, and dumped the body into the pickup trucks that 
they had. I'll never forget it in my life. Never! I thought it was so inhuman...no matter if it 
was Arab, if it was a Jew, he was dead...the person, whoever was left. And I thought he 

would be treated a little more...with some dignity, and not as if you tossing a pail of

garbage into the truck. But they did it. It was very, very cold...cold. And...uh...so we 
afterwards, we had to wait several hours. We  were allowed in when they cleaned up on 
the roads, etc., and the me ss...we were allowed to go to Nahariyya in our convoy when 
we me t. 
 
Q: You obviously fought through the Wa r of Independence.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long did you live in Israel?  
 
A: I stayed in Israel until 1959. That's when I left basically.  
 
Q: Okay. Tell us why you left and tell us some thing about you comi ng to this country. 
 
A: Well I (clearing throat) after the war I...I became a tourist driver guide, licensed by the 
governme nt and...uh...I had one of the blue license. There was a red and a blue. I was not 
a biblical scholar, but I did have and I do ha
ve a basic knowledge of the western Galilee, 
and I was familiar so I drove ma ny, ma ny....uh...tourists... dignitaries. Uh...I 
drove...uh...Polish...uh...commi ssion. They were ma king a film in the western Galilee. I 
drove...uh...I drove the Turkish Consul-General to Jerusalem...uh...the new one that came  
to...to Israel at the time. I drove...uh...a....uh...Jewish 
 Parliamentary Commi ssions that 
came to visit also the western Galilee. Uh...I was assigned at one time, and I 
drove...uh...Isaac Bensfee
, the President of Israel at the time, and his wife. They sat in the 
back of my car, and in the front...uh...we picked up in Auspina
 on the way to...uh...the 
excavations of Hotsora
 at the time...uh...we picked up the very famous archaeologist,       
         
uh...God bless their...their souls. Uh...He 
was the leading...uh...archaeologist in the 
country, and at the time he was also the Chief of
 Staff of the Israel Army. So we drove to 
the excavations of Hotsor
 in western Galilee. It was the most fascinating experience in 
life to listen to these biblical scholars speaking about how Joshua had taken over the 

mountains from the Canaanites. And it was a fascinating experience. 
 
Q: What ma de you decide...when do you come ...what ma de you decide to come  to the 
United States? 
 
A: I had the...the great honor of meeting a very charmi ng...uh ...older lady in Israel which 
is...uh...was my wife's great mother. And she used to live in New Rochelle, New York. 

She came to visit Israel on a few occasions. I only met her once. She was quite a elderly 
lady, and somehow or another we then had a little reunion, and it was discussed that...uh 

...perhaps we should come  and stay with her family in the United States because myself I 
only had a brother in Israel at that time. And my wife had these cousins and...and so 
forth. And then a little bit later on, again by...by...by sheer coincidence, there was another 

me mber from the United States, a father-in-law 
of my wife's cousin. He had, at the time, 
arrived to visit Israel and I had a meeting with him with my mother-in-law and he was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

very exciting ma n. He was a Polish Jewish fellow...uh...name ly Abe Rockland
 was his 
name , God bless his soul. And he told me  in his broken English, he said, "You should 
come to America yesterday.ﬂ And..uh...kind of I...I start to think a little bit more in that. 
Now I always liked United States. As a child in Portugal, I used to love to read. 

Books...the little booklets about Buffalo Bill. That was my number one hero was Buffalo 
Bill. And the buffalo and the...and the things...fi
ghts with the Indians and all that sort of 
things. I used to read a lot. And that's how I...I read a lot of it in...in...I couldn't quite 
understand English at that time, but I forced myself and taught myself some  English. And 
so I always had the good vision that the United States, of course, is...is the greatest in the 
world. And it is. And...uh...and we decided then to immi grate, to  come  to the United 

States, and we left Israel...uh...in 1959, and we came to the United States in 1959. My 
wife, Miriam, and my daughter, Tama ra, my
 son, Daniel, and my son, Michael. Uh...My 
daughter, Tamara, went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she 

graduated from high school. My son, Dani el, of course...uh... stayed in...with us, 
and...uh...he joined the army without my knowledge...uh...joined the Vietnam war. He 
volunteered to...uh...to...to go to Vietnam. A
nd...uh...although (clearing throat) I am very, 
very proud of him because...uh...he served with great honors...the...uh...with the Green 
Berets, and also with the Ninth Arme d Calvary. And he was shot down four 
times...uh...from the helicopters. He used to be with the...uh...the...uh...the 

small...uh...OV
 helicopters, the observations helicopters. And fortunately enough, he was 
always fell in some rice paddies or within the area that he was not...never injured. 
Uh....he jumped out of the choppers actually, when the choppers were...were attacked. 
And...uh...he's very heavily (clearing throat) honored ...uh...Presidential citations and 

bronze stars. He has three bronze stars and many other medals, and I'm very, very proud 
of him. And Michael, my younger son, works with me  in the business.  
 
Q: Thank you. I'd like...I'd like to go back a little now. 
 
A: Sure.Sure. 
 
Q: If we could, I'd like to go back to Portugal...uh...during the war.  
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: You're a young ma n of 16?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Can you tell us a little more about your impressions of the refugee community that 
filled the Jewish soup kitchen?  More about the people, and about the numbers of people 

that came there. 
 
A: Alright.It's...uh... 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
19
 
 
 
Q: Could you repeat the question?  Just repeat it a little. The mi crophone will pick it up. 
 
A: Okay. I...uh...uh...I understand that you would like to know a little bit more about the 
situation in the soup kitchen...uh...perhaps some  numbers of refugees that came by and 
what was the...the situation, the atmosphere. Uh...It's...uh...sometimes difficult...uh...to go 
back so ma ny years and...and be able to precisely me morize on what happen then. 

Uh...But something of very interest that I should have and I did not mention earlier, 
was...uh...by a sheer coincidence, as I told you before, I happened to be a cousin to 
Senator from Minnesota, Rudy Boshwitz, through my wife because of the ma rriage. And 

his wife, Ellen Boshwitz, was one of the ref
ugees that passed through Lisbon at that point 
in time in history. But I don't remember meeting her then, because she was much 

younger. She was a younger person than me . And I do not reme mber...I don't she was 

necessarily at the soup kitchen because not all the refugees that came to Portugal were at 
the soup kitchen. Some  of the refugees...they...they were persons of me ans that were able 
to some how ma nage to bring some  money with them, some ...and they were able to stay 

in...in hotels and...uh...for a given period of time. And...uh...and I understand that Ellen 
and her family...they left Lisbon by boat to Brazil, and then from Brazil, they came to the 
United States. But...uh...most of the other refugees that really had no me ans and were 

waiting for visas to...uh...to... uh...immi grate to the Unites States, to Israel, to South 
America, etc., etc...uh...there was a time in...uh...Portugal when...uh...many of these 
refugees' visas had expired, and they are allowed to stay a given period of time, if it was 

3 months, 6 months, etc. And as a result the...uh...the Portuguese, if I ma y say so, are 
very...the Portuguese language is a very complete language. They say                
. 
Everything is to be just so. Uh...And they'r e very particular. And the reason they'r e law-

abiding. So...so when the refugees visas expired, the next step was you are jailed. Simple 
as that! Now, you have here...uh...uh...a large group of people, reasonable large, several 

hundred people that suddenly, while they were able to escape the Nazi persecution and 
the Nazi armi es, are being put in jail in Lisbon with common criminals. And the sad part 
is, of course, that most of these people in large numbers were academicians. They were 

doctors. They were engineers. They were scientists, etc., businessmen, etc. So the 
Portuguese-Jewish community and I believe again here, in conjunction with the 
American Joint Committee, asked the government of Portugal to allow these 

refugees...to...to assign to these refugees some small villages surrounding Lisbon so 
they...they could with some ...some dignity live in there, until they were able to receive 
visas to leave Portugal. And this was granted. There was several little villages. I can't  

remember...I think one of them that I remember is            
 that was allowed for refugees 
to stay there. They were not allowed to move out of these villages without the permission 
of the Portuguese...uh...Naturalization Immi gration Department, because they were very 
strict. Uh...The president of the time of th
e Jewish community in Lisbon was Professor 
Onsolack
. Uh...He was the professor of...uh...science in the University of Lisbon. And 
ironically...uh...it is often said that he was good friend with the Prime Minister Salosar
. 
even though that Solsar
 give orders to          
 not to issue visas to Jews...uh...on the       
side, the Portuguese government was very strict. And I cannot, as I said earlier, 
personally say, that I was persecuted by the Portuguese government. I was not as such. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027

Uh...That Jews were persecuted by the Portuguese government, I can't  say that either. 
Either than the fact that        
 was removed from his position, that it is true of the 
Portuguese people, not the government, that they were very helpful to the Jewish 
refugees. In ma ny instances! And ma ny stores even, I understand, even giving them 
clothing. Although I have tendency to disagree with some of the statistics that are comi ng 

out from the Portuguese governme nt side stating that over 40,000 Jewish refugees came 
to Lisbon. I...I know...I'm quite certain that...that as ma ny refugees as I saw in the soup 
kitchen, I did not see 40,000 refugees come  to the soup kitchen. If indeed there were 

refugees that came to Portugal and some how they...those that you never knew 
about...they...they came in; they stayed a few days in a hotel; they got a visa; they kept on 
going to South America or...or...or North Ameri
ca or...or...or Palestine or Israel or other 
countries for that ma tter, I do not know. I do not know. And...uh...in as much as the 
atmosphere itself in the soup kitchen, it was..uh...I tried to bring back my...my mental 
me mory...uh...and look at these families sitting on the table and...uh...and...uh...they were 

not happy faces to say the least. You could always see sad faces. Okay?  Faces of 
when...when a person is concerned, when you are worried about...uh...whatever happened 
to...to your mother, your father, your uncle, 
your aunt, your niece, your brother, your 
sister?  You don't know. You didn't know. You were the lucky one. You were able to 
ma ke it. You run away fast. You..you were lucky to do it. You saved your life. What 
happened to the other ones? And it was very difficult. And it was a concern because as 

you well know, Jewish are so very emotional, and...uh...there were ma ny a tears in the 
kitchen soup, ma ny a tears and you could see...you could observe that. Uh...And yet there 
was...uh...as I told you before about this fellow, Gustof Zumi ck
, repairing the shoes of 
other refugees. That was the least he could have done to help his fellow...fellow...fellow 
in...in...in this instance you know. So there was a...a...a still a little bit of a sense 
...of...uh...of, "I am your...my brother's keeper," you know. That's a atmosphere that I can 

best describe. Helping some one with the nothing that you have, you know. And I think it 
was very typical of the...of the Jews at the time, helping each other with the least that 
they had, with the nothing that they had. So I don't know if I answered your question. 
 
Q: You did indeed. Is there anything you want to add. 
 
A: (Sigh)  Yes. I...I'm having a hard time keeping my tears inside me. Because every time 
when I think about these things, you know...uh...I happen to be Jewish too and very 
emotional too. It's hard to keep them down. Really. It's...uh...my friends that were killed 
during the war and....uh...even some  of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed 

persons and...uh... Later on in Israel, if I may add that too, as I became a tourist driver 
guide, there was a kibbutz by the name  of               
. In English, it's called the ghetto of 
fighters. I was very, very fortunate again because I was called on more than one 

occasions...many, ma ny times, to drive one of the leaders of the ghetto fighters. His name  
was Isaac Zuckerman
. Yes. And I drove that ma n so ma ny times, taking him from the 
kibbutz, bringing him to Nahariyya, bring him to Haifa, bring him here, bring him there. 
And there was a girl by the name of Miriam. I cannot remember her other number. But 
she was also one of the few...Isaac Zuckerma n and Miriam were one of the few Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0027 
21
 
 
 
people that were able to...to get out of the Wa rsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive. I guess most of 
the leaders were all killed by the...by the ...by the Germans, by the Nazis armi es. But they 
survived. And...uh...as the kibbutz was being from...from the very beginning...uh...which 
was built near a Roma n aqueduct in...about 5 kilome ters south of Nahariyya,            
, as it 
was built up, of course, I used to bring tourists over there also to visit the kibbutz              
 
. But this was... uh...one of the last things really I...that it was very, very touching. 
Anytime you went to the...into the ghetto's fighters, as they were building the kibbutz and 

talking to these people and...and witnessing the things that they did to humanbeings, 
ma king soap out of hair and skins and children, that was...uh...uh... As far as I'm 

concerned...I'm...I'm one of those that believe in the philosophy that never again...I'm 
gonna die with some  dignity, as opposed to just submit.  
 
Q: With that note, I think we end. 
 
A: Good. 
 
Q:  Thank you very much. 
 
d. Thank you.
