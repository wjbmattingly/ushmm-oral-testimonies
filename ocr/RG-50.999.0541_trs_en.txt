To begin
,  
we pr epared a brief s lide pr es entation. We begin with this very cute pic ture of Alfr ed 
Munzer as  a little boy. I want to explain a little bit bec aus e it's a partic ular ly appr opriate photogr aph for 
today of all days . Today is  a s pec ial day. Tonight m arks the J ewis h holiday of Pur im on whic h c hi
ldr en 
dr es s  up in c ostume. And by c oinc idenc e, we didn't plan this but when we s c heduled Al's talk  today, 

this  photo is  a photo of Al dres s ed for  Purim  on that day. He's  holding a c har ity box, whic h is  to r ais e 
m oney for the J ewis h c om munity in Isr ael. It s ays the J ewis h National Fund. And he is  d
r es s ed as  that 
box as  well. Today he is  not but there he is.
 
     
 
This  beautiful, beautiful shot is  a photograph of Al's  parents  on their  wedding day. Simc ha and 
Gis ele
 
were mar ried in 1932 in The Hague, in the Netherlands. They had three c hildr en, Al, baby. The 
photogr aph of their thr ee kids , the beautiful gir ls , Eva and Leah, and Al in between.
 
     
 
For  his tor ic al c ontext s o you under s tand
,  
the backdr op of whic h Al's  life unfolded
 
is  that of 
WorldWar II. On thi
s  map you will s ee the ar rows  indic ating that the German Arm y invaded The 
Nether lands  in May 1940, whic h, as  you will hear, is  ac tually before Al was  bor n. Im mediately life 

bec am e diffic ult for Dutch J ews . And thes e invas ion routes  s how not only The Netherlands but into 
Fr anc e and ac r os s  low c ountries , Belgium  and Luxembourg.
 
     
 
Al s urvived, thank s  to the c our age and generos ity and love of a m an that we s ee here named 
Tole Madna. Tole Madna was  an Indones ian imm igrant. For  thos e of you who ar e les s  familiar with the 

his tory of Indones ia, it was  form er ly a Dutc h c olony. So ther e was  an Indones ian imm igr ant c ommunity 

in the Nether lands . And that is  why you would s ee a fac e her e not what you would think of as  a typic al 
Dutc h r es c uer.We will hear more about that in our c onver s ation.
 
     
 
Al s pent the r est of the war , first year s of his  life, in hiding in Tole Madna's  hom e. He was  
c ar ed for by Tole's  Indones ian nanny, pic tured her e on the left
,  
a very extraor dinar y woman nam ed 
Mima Saina. Al is  on the right, in Tole's arm s.We will hear about them s oon.
 
     
 
After the war , Al c ame to the United States with his  mother, in 1958. He learned Englis h. He 
went to c ollege. He went on to medic al s c hool and bec am e a very ac c omplis hed pulm onologis t. I 

always  embar ras s him bec aus e he's  modest but he eventually s er ved as 
P
r es ident of the Am er ic an 
Lung As s oc iation. So a m an who has  devoted his  life to s ervic e. He remains  deeply involved in 

antis moking effor ts  ar ound the wor ld, working with the WHO, Wor ld Health Organizatio
n,  
to implement 
an international tr eaty on the c ontr ol of tobac c o.
 
     
 
We at the museum ar e ver y fortunate to be the benefic iaries  of many of Al's  volunteer hour s  
as  a s peak er, as a translator, giving tour s. He and his  s pous e ar e c her is hed mem bers  of our
 
c om m unity.
 
    
  
With that, I would like to as k  you to join me in welc oming Dr. Alfred Munzer.
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you, Al, very muc h for joining us today.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Delighted to be here.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Let's begin at the beg
inning
 
--
 a
c tually, befor e your  beginning. Pleas e tell us a little 
bit about your  parents and your fam ily bac k gr ound.
 

> > Al Munzer :  Sur e. Well, m y parents  wer e born in Eas tern Eur ope, a part of the wor ld that was  par t of 
the Austr o
-
Hungarian Empire and whic h after  the Fir s t Wor ld War became part of Poland.
 
My m other 
was  born in a small town c alled Rym anow, and my father in a neighboring town c alled Kanc zuga. They 

were c hildhood s weethearts. 
 
 
Thes e are tiny little s htetles , as they ar e c alled
 b
ut nonetheles s, I always  like to tell the stor y 
that one of the people who c am e from  m y mother's  little hom etown, fr om Rymanow, was  Is idor  Rabi. 
Is idor Rabi c am e to the United States , becam e a phys ic is t, and ended up being awarded a Nobel Pr ize 

in phys ic s  in 19
46 for 
the dis c overy of elec tr om agnetis m. So her e you have a ver y prom inent Nobel 
Pr ize winner c om ing from  one of thos e tiny towns .
 
    
  
But opportunities  in those towns  were very lim ited. After thos e towns  becam e part of Poland, 
after  the end of the Fir st WorldWar, there was  als o a lot of anti
-
Semitism. So young J ews  typic ally  
would leave their hom es and s eek their for tunes in a larger  city. That big city with a lot of attraction was  

3 
 
B er lin.
 
My m other  had two older  siblings who lived in Berlin and so s he joined them  in the 1920s . That's 
when s he c am e to Ber lin, befor e s he finally joined m y father at the end of 1932, in Holland.
 
     
 
My f
ather, on the other  hand, c ame direc tly fr om his  little hom etown to Holland wher e he 
s tarted a m en's c lothing bus ines s  in the Nether lands .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And ther e's a s ign s till in place. Right?  Is  ther e not?
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes. To m y great s urpris e
 
--
 
this was  a few year s  ago.We were walking ar ound The 
Hague and c am e to the hous e where I was  born. We lived above, in an apartment, and my father's  
bus ines s  was downs tairs . And ther e was  s till this s ign of my father's bus ines s  in the portic o, a beautif
ul 
glas s s ign. An inc r edible s hock to s ee that, a dir ect c onnection with m y father , whic h, of c our s e, I r eally 

did not have ver y m uc h other wis e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So your  parents c am e to Holland leav ing, tr ying to esc ape fr om pers ec ution, and 
being an intoler ant plac e of opportunity.What did you know fr om  your m other about what life was  like 
for them in Holland during the 1930s ?
 
> > Al Munzer :  My par ents  m ade many friends  in Holland. Mos t of their friends  were not J ewis h. J ews  

had lived in Holland for hundreds  of year s, wer e fully integrated into Dutc h s oc iety, and m y parents fit 
r ight in. As  I s aid, my father's m en's c lothing bus ines s  flouris hed. He did ver y well. They had many, 
m any friends. 
 
 
Am ong their neighbors  were two wom en, one of whom  I es pec ially r em em ber . I c alled her my 
Aunt J o. She was  a ver y devout Catholic  wom an. After the war, when I firs t met her, s he would s how 
m e notebooks written by one of my little s is ters . So s he was  really 
--
 
jus t this wom an was  s o intim ately 
involved with the lives
 
of my parents  that s he had ac tually 
the
s e notebooks and c ould tell thes e stor ies  
about m y s is ters .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Speaking of your s is ters , when did your par ents s tar t a family?
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my oldes t s is ter, Eva, was  bor n in 1936, July 1936.
 
I us ually like to explain that 
while people were having thes e ver y happy c ir c um s tanc es  in Holland, tr ying to live nor mal lives , jus t a 
few hundred m iles  away the Nazis  r eally c am e to full power. So, for  exam ple, on the day that m y 
par ents 
--
 
very c los e to
 
the date m y parents were m ar ried was  the day when Adolph Hitler  had 
appr oac hed the aging pres ident of Germany and was  made c hanc ellor of Germ any s tarting the Nazi 
er a. T
hat was  just about the s am e tim e my parents  wer e m arr ied.
 
    
 
A nd s imilarly, m y s is te
r  Eva was  born jus t as the infam ous  Ber lin Olympic s  wer e held
, 
whic h 
Adolph Hitler , of c our s e, tur ned into an ins trument of Nazi propaganda. So you have the juxtapos ition of 
a ver y happy family event and then jus t a few hundr ed miles away the increas e, the
 
ris e, really, of the 
Nazi er a.
 
     
 
And then two year s  later, in Novem ber  1938, is when my parents c elebr ated the birth of their  
s ec ond c hild and that was m y sister Leah. That, too, c or res ponded to a horr ible event in Germany 

bec aus e my sis ter Leah was  born just two days  after what is  c omm only c alled the Night of Broken 
Glass, Kr is tallnac ht. It's the night when the full fury of anti
-
Sem itism was  unleas hed in Ger many and 
hundreds  of s ynagogues were rans acked and des tr oyed and thous ands of J ewis h bus ines s es
 
were 
plunder ed.
 
 S
o, again, a ver y happy oc c as ion in Holland. And while m y par ents
 
m ust have been wor rying 
about the relatives  they had left behind, es pec ially in the c as e of m y m other , her older brother  and older  

s is ter who wer e s till living in Ber lin a
t the time with my parents c elebr ating this  happy oc cas ion of their  
s ec ond c hild.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  September  1, 1939, Ger many invades  Poland, s parking World War II. As I 
m entioned in the intr oduc tion, the following s pring The Nether lands  is inv aded.What c an you tell us  

about what this  m eant for your fam ily and other Jews ?
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my mother  has des cr ibed the events  of what happened as  
to 
the invas ion to m e. 
On the night of May 10, 1940, m y par ents  had been asked to shelter a man who was  a me
mber of the 
Dutch r es is tanc e m ovement. He s uppos edly c arried a br iefc as e, m y mother told m e, which c ontained 
plans  to preem ptively des tr oy the railroad c enter in the c ity. The Dutc h r es is tanc e felt if they c ould 

des tr oy that r ailr oad center  it would slow down the Ger man invas ion.
 

4 
 
     
 
That m or ning, my parents  and their  gues t lis tened to the r adio and hear d that the por t c ity of 
Rotter dam had been bombed and destroyed. And a few m inutes  later Queen Wilhelmina of the 
Nether lands  c am e on the r adio and announced, basic ally, that Holland had s urrender ed. She c alled on 
their citizens  to do their duty wher ever  they happen to find thems elves .
 M
y m other  told me that the fir s t 
per s on to s peak up was  the m an who was  a member  of the Dutc h res is tanc e m ovem ent. And he s a
id, 
in Dutc h, "Thank  God, it's  over ." 
 
 
As  far  as he was  c onc erned, he would jus t have to ac c omm odate to living under the 
oc c upation but he c ould be s atisfied that he had tried to do what he c ould to start or  stop the German 

invas ion.
 
But for my parents , a
s  they looked at their  two little c hildren in a playpen at the tim e, they 
r ealized that they wer e going to be all alone. And they knew what had happened to their relatives  in 

Germ any and in Poland es pec ially. They knew they were going to be all alone and t hat things were 

going to c hange very rapidly.
 
     
 
And, indeed, in ver y, ver y s hort or der all of the r es tric tions that had been put in plac e on J ews  
in Germany wer e put in plac e in Holland. The first thing that happened, my mother told me, was  a ban 
on the r itual s laughter of anim als  for  kos her m eat. And it's  s om ething that some people felt, well, that's 
a pretty benign thing, nothing ver y s erious. Maybe s om e people would even view it as , quote, 
hum ane
. 
But that was  jus t the fir s t s tep of is olating the J ew
s.  
The next thing was  the J ews  had to tak e on a new 
m iddle name
: t
he men, the m iddle
 
na
m e Is r ael
; w
om en, the middle name Sar ah. They had to register 
their pr operty to m ake c onfis c ation ultim ately m uch eas ier . And they had to regis ter , of c our s e, as Jews .
 
 
    
 
The other regulations  that wer e put in plac e were m uc h m or e res tr ic tive to their  per s onal lives . 
J ews  wer e prohibited from  us ing public  trans portation, m y m other told me. And they were pr ohibited 
fr om  going into public  parks .
 
That led to a partic ular  inc ident with m y m other , ac tually. When you have a 
r egulation that does n't make muc h s ens e, like being pr ohibited from going into your  neighbor hood park, 
you ignor e it. So m y m other ignored the regulation and s he took  my little sis ter, Leah, in her baby 
ca
r riage, to the park, a neighbor hood park . One day a Germ an woman appr oac hed the baby c arr iage 
and m y mother 's heart, she told me, alm ost s topped. And then the woman looked at the baby, m y little 

s is ter, the blond c ur ls  and blue eyes , and s he turned to m y mother and s he s aid, "Uh, you c an tell that 
this  is  good Ar yan, Ger man s tock ." And m y mother, of c ours e, had a s igh of relief
, th
anked the wom an
, 
a
nd never went back  into that park again.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  In fac t, your  parents ac tually enr olled your  s is ter in a Catholic  s c hool, did they not?
 
> > Al Munzer:  Yes. I'm not entir ely c lear  about the timefr am e that was  but I do have photogr aphs of my 
s is ter s being enr olled in a Catholic  s c hool to hide their J ewis h identity. I'm not s ure whether that 
happened
 
before m y s is ters  wer e plac ed into hiding or afterwards  but it c er tainly was  an attem pt to hide 
their Jewis h identity.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Ear ly in 1941 your par ents  realized s omething s urpr is ing, that your m other was  

pr egnant, with you.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Th
at's  right.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Tell us  what your mother told you about that tim e.
 

> > Al Munzer :  Yeah, early in 1941, as  the fam ily tried to go on with their nor mal lives , my mother found 
out that s he was  pregnant again. And s he c ons ulted her o
bstetric ian
 
and he told her in no unc ertain 
term s  that s he had to have an abortion. He told her  that it would be imm oral to bring another J ewish life 

into the wor ld.
 
     
 N
ow, my mother  was n't par tic ular ly r eligious  at the tim e but s he tur ned to the Bible for advic e
. 
And m y m other told me that s he read the stor y of Hannah. And Hannah, you m ight rec all, was  a wom an 
who was  desperate to c onc eive and would go to the tem ple ever y year  and pr ay that s he m ight have a 

c hild. And s he m ade this pledge
: I
f 
God
 
will give me a c
hild, I will give the c hild, that c hild, to the s ervic e 
of God all of the days  of his  or her life. And it was  in reading of Hannah's des per ate des ire to have a 

c hild that m y m other dec ided that s he c ould not pos s ibly have an abor tion. Her obs tetr ic ian fired her  as 
a patient. And s o November  23, 1941, I was  bor n at home with the help of a nurs e.
 

5 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And i
n addition to the 
profound leap of faith and fears your par ents  m ust have had 
to br ing a new J ewis h life into the world at that time and plac e, eight days later they did s om ething els e 
extraor dinar y.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes. Becaus e traditionally little J ewis h boys  ar e cir cumc is ed in a
 
Bris , a
 
c eremony when 
they are 8 days  old. And m y parents
™ 
fr iends  advis ed them  very s tr ongly, well, don't have hi
m 
c irc um c is ed; it will identify him as  being J ewis h. But this  tim e the ans wer  to my parents' dilemm a c ame 
in the form  of the wor ried look  on the fac e of a pediatr ic ian who had just exam ined m e. And m y father  
turned to the pediatr ic ian and he asked him , "Is
 
ther e anything wr ong with the baby?"  And the 
pediatric ian s aid, "No. It's  nothing s erious . It's  just that your  baby needs  a minor  oper ation that we c all a 

c irc um c is ion." And s o m y parents  told the pediatric ian of our J ewis h tradition and eight days  later
 
our  
fam ily gather ed pr obably for one of the ver y las t of cer em onies in Holland, r eally the first miles tone in 
the J ewis h life for  the Bris  c erem ony. Like any other  family, they had photographs  taken at the 
c er emony. They wer e ver y s mall photographs, actually. At leas t the only ones  I've s een. And it s hows  
the whole fam ily gathered in the living r oom
 a
nd a s ec ond pictur e with m e on a pillow.
 
     
 
What's  s pec ial about thos e photographs is  that they wer e only about 1
-
by
-
1.5
-
inc h in size and 
m y mother was  to keep the two little photographs hidden on her body thr ough her subsequent state in 
12 c onc entr ation c am ps . She developed this  feeling, this  s upers tition, that if s he ever los t thos e 
photogr aphs
,  
it would mean that I had been killed. 
 
 
For tunately m y mother
 
survived, the photographs s ur vived, and, of c our s e, I s urvived. And 
thos e photogr aphs, of c ours e, are s o fr agile, s o valuable, that I did not want to keep them in the hous e. 

And that's why I entrusted them to the United States  Holoc aus t Mem or ial Mus eum  and they ar e now 
par t of the s tor y of this mus eum.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you. And it is  a s acred duty for us  to c are for them. So thank you.
 
     
 
Over  the fir s t 10 m onths  of your life things bec ame inc reas ingly dangerous for  J ews . In the 
Nether lands  the
y wer e for c ed to wear  yellow s tar s, r is kier  and r iskier ever y day. Your  parents 
eventually bec ame c onvinc ed they needed to go into hiding. Tell us a little bit about how they ar ranged 
to do that.
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, many of you m ay be familiar with the famous stor y of Anne Fr ank , another Dutc h 
family, Dutc h J ewis h family, that went into hiding. Of cours e, they went into hiding as  one unit. But my 
par ents dec ided, like many other  families , that as a form of ins ur anc e s o that if one per s on was  taken in 
the
 
family and was  killed at leas t the other s might s urvive that we ought to s plit up.
 
     
 
The first to go to hiding was  my father. He had rec eived a notic e to r eport for labor  duty in a 
c am p in Holland. He knew that that meant eventually being s ent to a c a
m p m uc h fur ther  eas t, as they 
were c alled at the tim e. So he was  the first one to go into hiding, pretending to c omm it an ac t of suic ide 
whic h gained him  adm iss ion to a ps yc hiatric  hospital.
 
     
 
Then m y m other, through the intervention of two 
--
 
the s ame
 
aunt, our neighbor, Aunt J o, as  I 
s aid, was  a very devout Catholic  wom an, and s he put m y m other in touc h with two pries ts , a Father 
Cum mings , and Father  Ludder s , 
[ph] 
and they, in turn, told her about a woman who had had a dream in 
whic h s he s aw the Virgin telling her to take J ewis h c hildr en into hiding. And s o m y two s is ters , Eva and 
Leah, were plac ed with that wom an with that very devout Catholic  woman. And that's  when they r eally 
as s umed, you know, their  Catholic  identity
 e
ven though they may have attended a Catholic  s c hool 
before.
 
     
 
That left m y m other alone with m e in our home. My m other des c r ibed being extr em ely 
fr ightened being alone in our hous e. She was  afr aid of the door bell ringing bec aus e s he thought it m ight 

be one of the Germ an s oldiers  c o
ming to the home
 s
o s he dam pened the c lapper  of the doorbell. And 
then, of c ours e, s he s pent the whole night watc hing the c lapper bec aus e it was n't making any nois e, to 
s ee if it was  m oving. So this  was  jus t the inc r edible tension that s he felt being left alone in the house.
 
     
 
J ewis h boy c hildren wer e m or e diffic ult to plac e but finally a neighbor of my mother, a wom an, 
Annie Madna, agreed to take m e in. And s o my mother took  m e to Annie who lived r ight ac r os s  the 
s tr eet fr om us . But Annie had had s ome 
r un
-
ins  with the Nazis  her s elf s o she fir st pas s ed m e on to her 
s is ter. And then it turned out that the sis ter  had a neighbor who was a m em ber of the Dutc h Nazi Party 

6 
 
and she was  afraid that they might hear  a baby c rying s o s he returned m e to Annie Madna. 
And then 
finally Annie Madna pas s ed me on to her ex
-
hus band. She had been mar ried to an Indones ian man, 
Tole Madna. They were divor c ed. She pas s ed me on to her  ex
-
hus band. And that's how I c am e to be 
with Tole Madna.
 
     
 
At that point m y m other joined my
 
father in the s am e ps yc hiatric hos pital, hiding, in her c ase 
pr etending to be a nurs e.
 
     
 
So I was  adopted, for  all pr ac tic al purpos es, by Tole Madna and es pec ially by the nanny who 
had taken c are of the three Madna c hildren ear lier . Her nam e was  Mim a Saina. She was  an Indones ian 

woman, c ompletely illiter ate, s poke no Dutch, c ouldn't r ead or  write, only s poke the Indones ian 
language, had c ome to the Nether lands to do work in a r es taurant whic h Papa Madna, as  I us ed to c all 
him , Tole Madna, was  manager of and eventually  s he bec ame the nanny for his  c hildren.
 
     
 
This  woman, who was  illiter ate, had a heart of gold. She would literally walk  m iles  ever y day 
jus t to get m ilk  for  m e. I was  in the hom e c om pletely illegally and ever ything was  very, ver y s tr ic t
ly 
r ationed. So you had to have c oupons  for  any kind of food that you wanted. So if you wanted milk for  a 
baby, you had to have coupons . And s inc e I was  in the hom e illegally, there wer e no c oupons. So sh
e 
had to 
s c r ounge ar ound even to get m ilk for  m e.
 
  
   
 
Ac tually, a few year s  ago I was  in Holland and a wom an approac hed me and s aid, 
ﬁY
ou know, 
you us ed to dr ink m y m ilk .
ﬂ 
And I s aid, 
ﬁW
hat do you mean?
ﬂ
  
And s he s aid, "Well, all s chool c hildren in 
Holland were given a little bottle of m ilk every day. And
 
m y mother told m e to s ave half that little bottle 
for the baby next door. And you wer e the baby next door." So here you have a 6
-
year
-
old c hild 
par tic ipating in s aving another life.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  If I can interrupt jus t one s econd. Your s is ter s were
 
not phys ic ally hidden, though. I 
want to m ake s ur e that the vis itor s  unders tand that you c ould be hidden in the open and you c ould be 

vis ually, liter ally, hidden.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes. They were hidden quite in the open, ac tually, as Catholic  c hildr en, atte
nding 

Catholic  s c hool. In my c as e, I was  not allowed out of the hous e at all. There wer e only two little kids 
who were allowed to c om e into the hous e and play with me. They wer e neighbor s
, t
he neighbor s ' kids. 
And the reas on they wer e tr us ted is  that they were Germ ans  but they wer e c omm unis ts . They wer e 
Germ an c ommunis ts. So they were ver y anti
-
Nazi. So they were thoroughly trus ted to c ome into the 
hous e and play with m e.
 
     
 
I'm told that I s lept in Mim a's bed and s he kept a knife under her pillow, I'm  t
old, vowing to kill 
any Naz i who might try to c ome and get m e
 o
r even, s he s aid, kill me r ather  than have me fall in their 
hands . An amazing, amazing wom an.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: When you des c r ibe the Comm unis t neighbors, the little gir l next door, it's jus t
 
a 
r em inder of how tenuous the s ituation was  for you and for c hildr en like you, how it took  networks of 

trust. 
 
 
I would invite you, if you have tim e today, down the hall on this level. We have a s pec ial 
exhibition c alled Som e Were Neighbors , and it's exactly about that, about the c onnec tions  between 

fr iends , c o
-
workers , teacher s  and s tudents, all the pers onal r elations hips  that c ould allow a s mall baby 
or  an adult to s ur vive.
 
     
 
Al, as  a parent, it's  hard for  m e to im agine the tr ust that your par ents had to have in what wer e 
es s entially s tr angers.What c ontact if any, did they have with you, with your  s is ters, with their r es cuers ?  

What did they know?
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my mother  
--
 
m y par ents knew the Madna fam ily quite well. They all lived in the 
s am
e neighbor hood. Papa Madna, after  the war , always  pr ided hims elf that he had a s uit that c ame 
--
 
that was  m ade by m y father , actually, his  works hop. So, you know, ther e was  a really good c onnec tion 

and they were really tr usted.
 
     
 
My par ents  did not k now the wom an who had agreed to take in my s isters  ver y well. And that 
ended up being a m ajor pr oblem  bec aus e about a year later or s o, after my s ister s were in hiding, her  
hus band, the hus band, announc ed his  wife was  hiding two J ewis h c hildren.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So he turned her in.
 

7 
 
> > Al Munzer :  So his  wife was  taken pr is oner, along with m y two s is ter s. His  wife eventually was  freed 
but m y s is ters , who were then 6 and 8 year s old, wer e taken to a pr is on first, near Holland, a building 
m y m other c ould never  stand to look  at again. It was  a r eal problem  for her after the war bec aus e she 
knew that that's  where my two s is ters  had been taken. They were then taken to a Dutc h c onc entr ation 
c am p, and then almost imm ediately s hipped to Aus c hwitz where they were killed. Februar y 11, 1944. 
They were 6 and 8 years old
 a
t the tim e. So there you have the two c ompletely diver gent stories.
 
     
 
The mem or ies that I have of being with the Madna family 
--
 
ther e aren't too many m em or ies . I 
was  muc h too little, 9 m onths  old
, 
when I had been left with them. So I have ver y few mem or ies  but 
they are fun ones , happy ones . I rem em ber Papa Madna playing at the piano. I r em ember Mim a 
s inging lullabies  to me. I r em em ber one tim e getting very angry, ac tually, at my two 
f
oster sisters. 
They 
were doing their  hom ework and wr iting. So I, as a little kid, like any other kid, tried to imitate them . I 
took a pen and started sc r ibbling. And they all broke out in laughter  bec aus e obvious ly the s c ribblings 
m ade no s ens e. And I got ver y, ver y angry bec aus e they were laughing at me. It was  one of thos e few 
m em or ies  that I have.
 
     
 
But ther e wer e other m em ories . I r emem ber, for example, having to go into hiding into a s mall 
c ellar. But even that was  a happy m em ory bec aus e the one thing that s tands
 
out was  playing with all 
the Chr istm as  dec or ations  that were hiding there. And that's the thing that s tands  out. So m y m emories , 

you know, of thos e year s were ver y, ver y happy ones .
 
     
 
Now, my parents, interestingly enough, were allowed one m or e vis it with my s is ters befor e my 
par ents were als o deported. And that was  for Chris tmas  Day 1942. That's  when my two s is ter s were 
taken to the ps yc hiatric  hos pital wher e both m y par ents at that point were hiding, m y m other a nur s e, 
m y father as  a patient, and ther e was  a mini r eunion of the family then. But thr ee days  later the 
ps yc hiatric  hos pital was  em ptied of all patients and s taff and they wer e all depor ted and taken to a 

c onc entration c am p.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So they c ould not know that would be the las t tim e they would s ee their gir ls .
 
> > Al Munzer :  Abs olutely. No. No. Ther e was  s till that hope that eventually there m ight be peac e.
 
     
 
After
,  
m y parents were taken to the s am e c onc entr ation c am p that I m entioned ear lier , 
Westerbork , then to another c oncentration c amp on Dutc h s oil c alled Vught wher e they both did s lave 
labor  for the Philips  elec tr onic s  c om pany. And m y m other des cribed being in that c onc entration c amp 
wher e ther e would be a morning line
-
up every day at about 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. She s ays  one day 
Heinric h Him m ler, Hitler's  s ec ond in c om mand, cam e to vis it the c am p and he gave a big s peec h. He 

exhorted all the pr is oners  to keep wor king for the s
uc c es s of the Germ an R
eic h and that as  long as  
they kept wor king, nothing bad would ever happen to them .
 
     
 
My m other told m e way in the dis tanc e while he was  s peaking s he s aw a s pir e of a s mall 
Dutch c hur c h. She s aid it would be s o wonderful
 
if peac e were to c om e at that m oment and s he could 
r un to that c hurc h and fall on her knees and thank  God for  being fr eed. It didn't matter to her  whether it 
was  a c hur c h, a s ynagogue, or a m osque, just a plac e to thank  God for being fr eed.
 
     
 
Of c ourse, you know, Heinr ic h Himm ler lied and three m onths later  the c onc entr ation c am p in 
Vught was  em ptied of all pr is oners and they were all s ent to Aus c hwitz. And that's where my par ents  

were s epar ated.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You des c ribed your tim e in the Madna
 
household to m e as life thr ough the mail 
s lot. Can you des c r ibe what you mean by that?
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes. As I s aid, I was n't allowed out of the hous e at all. And the only view that I had of 

the outs ide world was  what I c ould see thr ough a mail s lot. There were s ome people who were really 
neighbor s of m y par ents  who wer e ver y anx ious to s ee how I was  doing and they were not allowed into 

the house either  but they, too, c ould look into the hous e thr ough the m ail slot to s ee that I was  ar ound. 
And that's really the lim it of m y outs ide view.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  For  year s .
 
> > Al Munzer :  The firs t four  years  of m y life.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You s aid that not m any of the Dutc h neighbor s  k new you wer e ther e but m any in 
the Indones ian c omm unity did. Given that this  was  a period of tim e when Jews  were being ac tively 

8 
 
hunted by Germ ans
, 
what stor y did the Madna fam ily c om e up with to explain the pr es enc e of a white 
toddler in their Indones ian hous ehold had you been s een?
 
> > Al Munzer :  They had thr ee c hildr en who r eally looked ver y, very different but who did adopt m e as  
their little brother.
 A
ctually, there was a vote in the fam ily to keep m e ther e. That's  s om ething I found 
out fairly rec ently. The plan initially was  for  m e to be s hipped to the family in s om e of the
 
Dutc h 
farm lands  wher e mos t Jewis h c hildr en wer e hidden. But the Madna c hildr en wer e s o fond of me they 

wouldn't par t with m e. And that's how I ended up spending the year s with them .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  At gr eat risk  to their fam ily.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Abs olut
ely, a tremendous  r isk to the fam ily.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You've s aid by the winter  of 1944, 1945, you'r e a little older , you have s ome 
c learer mem or ies , that that winter was  partic ularly  hard and bitter. Can you tell us a little about what 

you r ec all?
 
>> 
Al Munzer : What I remember was  being hungry. There was  very, ver y little food in Holland during 
that las t winter . All I remem ber is  one day s eeing the table set for  break fas t and I got up fr om m y bed, 

walked over  to the table, hoping that I was  about to be fed. I remem ber falling as leep with m y head 
falli
ng on the plate and one of my fo
s ter  s ister s c om ing to get m e there and finding me ther e. That's one 
of thos e other m em ories  of being with the Madna fam ily.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  That winter a lot of the Dutc h population s urvived by eating tulip bulbs .
 
> > Al Munzer :  That's  c orrec t. Yes. 
 
 
You asked m e of the s tories  Papa Madna would c om e up with to explain my pres enc e. 
Bec aus e the hous e had been s ear c hed s everal tim es . He told s ome of the Germ an s oldier s tha
t I was 
the illegitim ate c hild of his  ex
-
wife and that s he now had a new boyfr iend who did not want m e around 
and that's why s he had pas s ed m e on to him. That was  one of the m any s tories  he c onc oc ted.
 
     
 I
'm told that another  tim e the family dec ided that it s hould be Mim a ans wering the door. 
Bec aus e s he s poke no Dutc h no Germ an, there was  total m is c ommunic ation between her and the 

s oldier  who c am e to the door . So he gave up and just walked away.
 
    
 
Papa Madna was  a man who was  fabulous at m aking up stor ies . He c ould tell a s tor y like the 
one I told you just with a s tr aight fac e and be very, ver y believable.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: We ar e running s hort on tim e but ther e are s ever al m ore things to c over. Tell us  
br iefly what happened to your par ents  after the
y wer e inc ar c er ated.
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my mother  
--
 
both of m y parents , as  I s aid, ended up in Aus c hwitz. That's where 
they wer e s eparated. My  m other was  s ent on to work thr ough s lave labor in another electr onic s factor y, 
Telefunken, in a c onc entration cam p called Reic henbac h. My mother des cribed witnes s ing that camp 

being bombed by the allies and s aying a prayer of thanks  to God in Hebrew as  s he s aw the factor y 
going up in flames .
 
     
 
But that was  not the end of her or deal bec aus e the Germ ans  then evac uated all the pris oner s 
and m oved them further wes t on what wer e c alled Death Marc hes . And many people did s uc c um b. But 
eventually m y mother was  freed at the Danis h border.
 

     
 
My father's  story was different. He r emained in Aus c hwitz for about s ix m onths  and then went 
on to another c onc entration c am p in Austr ia c alled Mauthaus en, a r eal hell hole of a c am p. 
 
 
If you vis it the exhibit ups tair s, you will s ee an exhibit of thes e huge 
boulders
 
that the 
pr is oner s  were forc ed to car ry in that c am p where they would ver y often be tr ipped. Many of them  los t 

their lives  that way.
 
 
Then m y father went on from Mauthaus en to thr ee m or e c am ps, Gus en, Styr, and finally a 
c am p c alled Ebens ee. It was  high in the Austrian alps , a beautiful s pot wher e "The 
S
ound of 
M
usic" 
was  ac tually filmed. 
 
 
My father worked in abandoned s alt mines  as s em bling r ockets, horr ible, horr ible work .
 
He did 
s ee liberation. He was  liberated by the U.S. Army but he was  so weakened that he pas s ed away two 
m onths later, s till in Ebens ee. He lies  buried in the c onc entration c amp of Ebens ee. 
 
 
And I vis ited his  grave, whic h was an am azing experienc e. It's the firs t time, the only time, 
when I fully c am e to grips  with the los s
 
of m y father. I broke out in tears as I s tood at his  grave. An 

9 
 
inc r edible exper ienc e.
 
Som ething s imilar happened when I vis ited Mauthaus en. Ther e was  a 
m onument put up by the Dutc h government. And there I found, totally to my s ur pr is e, m y father's nam e. 
A
gain, the s ame reac tion. It really s uddenly hit m e that I had los t m y father, that I never  had a c hance to 
know m y father.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  J ust las t year you lear ned additional details about your  father thr ough doc uments  
in this  building. Right?
 

>> Al 
Munzer :  That's  r ight. Yeah, every day s till doc um ents  still appear . I c am e ac r os s a little s lip of 
paper of when m y father was  in Aus c hwitz. It his  number as  a pr is oner . And then in German it s aid 
"Premium E
m ployee." No nam e, just a num ber . And then a s ig
nature
, ﬁPremium E
m ployee.
ﬂ  
S o I as ked 
a res earc her what that meant. And the r es ear c her told m e that it m eant that the Germ ans
 
--
 
the 
factor ies  had to pay the wages  of the s lave laborer  they employed to the SS, to the Nazis . And it m eant 

that your father was  c ons idered a pr emium  employee and they had to pay higher  wages to the SS. J ust 
an am azing example of the trem endous bureauc rac y that was  s et up bas ic ally to kill people.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  That stor y is  just one example of what we are c onstantly, daily
, dis c overing. It's 
eas y to think  about the Holoc aus t as an exhaus tively res earc hed topic  but every day we find new 
things.We expect the s ize of our c ollec tion to double in the next 10 years, double. That's m ind
boggling, 
a little intim idating to his tor ian
s , but eac h of them is  a story like your  father.
 
     
 
Tell us about your  mother's liberation.
 
> > Al Munzer :  My m other was  liberated through the inter vention of a man who was  the head of the 

Swedis h Red Cr oss. He had negotiated the fr eedom  of s everal thous and wom en. My m other  des cr ibed 
c om ing off of thes e c attle c ar s on to Danis h s oil and being greeted by the c ount. And s he s ays  s he and 
her  fellow pr is oner s  wer e s o ashamed of their appearanc e but the c ount ins is ted on embr ac ing ever y 
s ingle one of the pr is
oners  as they cam e off the train. 
 
 
And 
then she was  s ent to r ec uper ate in Sweden. And she r emained in Sweden for  about three 
m onths.
 A
nd in August 1945 is  when I was r eunited with my mother. And that's the firs t r eally c lear 
m em or y that I have. I remem ber
 
being as leep in one of the back room s
, m
y s is ter c om ing to wak e me.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Your  fos ter  s ister.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Right. I s till c all her  my s is ter now. She's  still alive. That's  
--
 
exac tly. But s he c arr ied m e 
into the living r oom. I was  c ranky, c r ying. And the whole family was  gathered in the living r oom , s itting 
in a c irc le. She pass ed me from lap to lap like
 
you
 
do with a kid who is  cr ying. And I r emem ber that 
ther e was  one lap I wouldn't s it in, one woman I pus hed away. And that was  m y own m ot her. Bec aus e 

s he was  a total stranger to m e. And I alr eady had a mother  and that was  Mima Saina.
 
     
 
My m other r ealized that it would be ver y diffic ult to s eparate me from Mima and s o her plan 
was  for  Mima to c ontinue to c are for  m e while m y mother  went out looking for wor k . But s adly two 
m onths later , October 1945, Mima had a c er ebr al hem orr hage and pas s ed away. And s o I have very, 
very few m emories , actually, of Mima, a few wor ds  of the Indones ian language whic h was  m y nativ e 
tongue. That's  how s he spoke to me. And I r emem ber vis iting her grave bec aus e Papa Madna took  m e 
ther e s o m any tim es . But other than that I have r eally no dir ec t memor ies  of Mim a at all.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You did des cr ibe Mima s inging lullabies  to you. Can you tell us  about one?
 
>
>  Al Munzer:  One of the amazing experienc es  I've had through the Mus eum  was  about two years  
ago. I was  meeting up with a gr oup of Indones ian s tudents vis iting the United States
, a
 
gr oup of about 
30 s tudents. I told them the s tory, with photogr aphs  of Mim a
 
holding m e, Mima in ver y tr aditional 
Indones ian dres s ing. And then at the very end
 
of
 
the story, I said, you know, Mim a us ed to s ing a 
lullaby to me and it was  c alled "Nina Bobo." And all 30 s tudents  s tarted s inging the lullaby in unis on. An 

am azing, am azingly moving exper ienc e for m e.
 
     
 
And after that, young wom en
 
with head sc ar ves , traditional 
--
 
you know, Indones ia is  now the 
lar gest Mus lim  c ountry in the wor ld. Thes e young women in head scar ves  c om ing up to me, hugging 

m e and kis s ing me and saying "We ar e all one fam ily." An amazingly powerful m es s age. It s hows , you 
know, that the
 
m es s age that we c onvey in the mus eum and m y per s onal stor y has  s till a trem endous  
impact.

> > Edna Fr iedberg:  You now have gone to Indonesia. And the Mus eum  does  wo
r k  in B
ahas a,
 
the
 
language of Indones ia, and Al is  a c los e partner  in that work.
 
     
 
I'll ask  you two m or e things befor e we open it to the audienc e. Tell us  about an inc ident at the 
m ovies  that happened to you and your  mother  when you and your  m other wer e in Holland not long after  

the war when you went to s ee a movie.
 
> > Al Munzer : We often think  that, you know, the end of the Holoc aus t or the end of anti
-
Sem itis m.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Of hatred of J ews .
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yeah. But m y mother and I were standing in 
line to go to a m ovie. This  mus t have been 
1946, s ometim e. Ther e was  a m an standing behind us and he saw m y m other's  tattoo from Aus c hwitz. 
And he s aid in Dutc h, "There is  one they didn't get." After that, of c our s e, my m other always  wor e 3/4
-
length s leeves . She did not want anyone to s ee the number that s he had. It s adly s hows  that anti
-
Semitis m, hatred of J ews , did not end with the Holoc aus t. Neither did it end hatred at all. 
 
 
The s addes t par t of the story of the Holoc aus t, as far as  I'm c onc er ned, is that it did not s pell 
an end tohatred. Hatr ed and genoc ide c ontinue to this  day.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I think  on that note we s hould open it for  ques tions . We have runners  with 

m ic r ophones bec aus e we want to be s ur e that ever yone c an hear. Pleas e r ais e your h
and and I will get 
a mic r ophone to you.
 
     
 
Firs t this  wom an and then this  young m an.
 
> > My Englis h is  not very good. I c om e from  Germany. I would like to know where your  father went 
--
 
why your  m other imm igrated to the United States.Was  it 
anti

Semitism still, even now, ac tive in all of 
Europe?  I'm s orry for this .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Did people hear the ques tion?  I'll repeat.
 
> > Did you under stand?  I'm s orr y. My Englis h is  not very good.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Even for Am er ic an ac c ents I always  repeat. The question is  about why your father  

fir s t immigrated to The Nether lands  and then why  you and your m other left The Nether lands . Was it 
bec aus e of anti
-
Semitism, dis c rim ination agains t J ews ?
 
> > Al Munzer :  My father left his  hom etown, Kanczuga,
 
bas ic ally for two reasons
:  
one, a lot of anti
-
Semitis m, and the s ec ond in Poland there wer e ver y few opportunities s o he dec ided to build a new life 

in a c ountry that had a muc h m ore liberal atmos pher e and that was  Holland. That's how he c ame to 
Holland. 
And that's the same m otivation that my mother  had in c oming to Ber lin in the 1920s.

the Second 
WorldWar, of the Holocaus t. After we c am e to the United States s he never  went back  to Holland. She 

tr aveled a lot, r eally tr ied to s tar t life all over  again and was  very s uc c es sful at that, I think . But ther e 
were c er tain things  that she did not want to go bac k  to and one of them was  going back  to Holland. She 
never did.
 
    
 
By the s am e token, my m other  never had a s tr ong anti

Yes ?

br ief answer  to this  but as br iefly as  you c an, I was  hoping you c ould elabor ate a little fur ther  on life

I heard talk  all around me of people who had not c ome back

a
nd others  who did c ome back, like m y m other. And s omehow, you know, my s is ters  did not c om e 
bac k . I didn't know what had happened to them . Aunt J o, as I told you, used to tell stor ies  about my 
s is ter s and how wonder ful they wer e. My mother told me stories  like that. And as  a c hild, 4

old, I was  actually s lightly jealous  of my two s is ter s. I did not understand what had happened to 
them.
 M
any of my c las sm ates had lost br others and s is ter s. Many of them  had
 
los t both parents . So I

grew up really with the Holoc aus t and it took  m any years  for me to really under s tand what that meant. I 
gues s I gained that knowledge ver y, very gr adually. But I thought, you know, play ing in a c ity that had 
been reduc ed to r ubble was  the most norm al thing. Playing on the beac h, hiding in bunker s , I thought 
that's  what kids do. Sadly kids  still do that in war zones  today.

Yes ?  The wom an in green.

get thos e photogr aphs  after the war?

good people and ther e wer e people who kept m any of my par ents' pos s ess ions  inc luding a ver y

r ized 
pos s es s ion of boxes  of photogr aphs. I have gone thr ough thos e photogr aphs . I s at down with m y 
m other , went through the photogr aphs . And that's how I have been able to tell the s tory of my fam ily .

any c los ing thoughts you would like to s har e with us ?
 
> > Al Munzer :  I think the one m es s age that I'd lik e to leave is  that, yes , the s tory of the Holoc aus t 
obvious ly is
 
a hor rible story. It's a ter r ible event. But what I'd like the m ess age to leave you with is  ther e 
were people in this  huge s ea of ter ror , of horrible events , of hatr ed, there were a few people who wer e 

willing to stand up and do the r ight thing, like the Madna fam ily. I would hope

this  is  the thing I leave 
c hildren with when I talk to c las srooms . I s aid, you know, whenever  you hear  people us ing the word 
"h

ever ything we pos s ibly can to im itate the Madna fam ily and s tand up even in a s ea of hate.
