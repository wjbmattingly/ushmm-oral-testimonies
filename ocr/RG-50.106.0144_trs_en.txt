Q: She older or younger? 
A: Younger. 
Q: Was your family re
ligiously observant? 
A: Yes, very. Yes, they were. We observe
d all the Jewish laws. My grandfather was 
very, very Orthodox. 
Q: Did you have a favorite holiday ? 
A: Yes, it was 
Sukkot
. We -- I vividly remember that we had a wonderful 
sukka h
 
built in the backyard and as 
children we loved to go there. And there™s a real big 
connection with us because 
when we went back to 
Germany
 in 1996 or seven, we 
were able to go into the 
backyard of a home where in 
-- into the -- our old home, 
and the present owner said, look, th ere™s 
a platform, a cement platform that you 
used for some kind of Jewish holid ay. So  
after all these years, the cement platform 
of our 
Sukkot -- sukkah
, was still there. And as a matter of fact, we went back this 
past summer to show it to my ol
dest son, and there it still was.  
Q: Did you live in a 
Jewish neig hborhood? 
A: We lived in a small town outside of 
Co log n e
 that had many Jewish families, but 
they were interspersed in
 the town. There was no such
 thing as quote, Jewish 
neighborhood.

Q: And what was the name of the town? 
A: At that time it was called 
Lechenich
, but today it is called 
Erfstadt
. And it is 
part of a huge county. There was -- there™s 
Erfstadt-Lechenich
, 
Ernstadt
, all these 
little towns are now under 
Erfstadt, E-r-f-s-t-a-d-t
. 
Q: Do you have any me
mories of life before 
Hitler
 came to power? 
A: No. 

Q: What are some of your earliest memo ries? 
A: Basically they start with 
wh en I had to go to school. In
 the town that
 we lived in 
there was no Jewish day school. And I starte
d school in 1935, and for the first year, 
the first six months I would 
say, I went to the public school. And th en the ed ict 

came down that Jewish children were not a
llowed to go to school any mo re, and I 
had to go to school in th
e town  wh ere my  grandmother lived, and I had to go and 
live with my  grandmother. Couldn™t live at home any mo re. In order to go to school, 
I moved there and went to school there. 
Q: And the name of that town? 
A: That town is called 
Linnich, L-i-n-n-i-c-h.
 And it was a -- maybe 45 minutes or 
an hour™s ride away. And I don™t think 
I was a happy camp er, but being with  my  
grandmother and not at home, it was all right
. And I went to school there for a -- for 
a year. And then my -- my aunt and uncle 
also lived with my 
gran dmother and they

emigrated to 
Holland
. And my  grandmother went to 
live with another daughter and 
I had to go home and I then went to school in 
Colo gne, 
wh ich was a half hour, 45 
minute train ride or bus ride from where 
we lived. So I commuted every day as a 
eight, nine year old, by train or bus to 
Cologne
 to school, on my  own.  
Q: What kinds of th
ings did you study? 
A: I was in a Jewish day school. I had -- 
we had all Jewish studies and also all 
secular studies. And I went there through 
what you would call here
, maybe fourth or 
fifth grade. 
Q: When  you were a child going to  school, 
wh at did you want to be when  you grew 
up? 
A: I really didn™t know, but I was always 
playing around with th
e thought of being a 
pediatrician, but it never went any further 
than that. But I do have to  backtrack and 
tell you that I was a feisty little girl, and 
coming off the bus one 
day there was this 
snotty little kid that called me dirty Jew. A
nd I went after him and beat him to pulp. 
And after I had done that I got scared 
and I ran. And between the bus stop and 
where we lived, one of my fa
ther™s cousins lived. So I ra n to his house to hide. Bu t 
he got his dues for calling me dirty Jew. 
He never called me dirty Jew again. And I 
mu st have been eight or nine years old. 

Q: Do you remember other 
episodes of anti-Semitism?

A: Yes, very vividly after 
Kristallnacht 
in 1938, we had to 
leave our home and we 
moved into an apartment in the city of 
Co lo gne
 where three uncles and an  aunt, 
brothers and sisters, all of whom were
 unmarried, lived. And it was like a two or 
three bedroom apartment and I don™t 
know how -- rememb er how many people 
piled in there. But now I wa
s supposed to walk to sch
ool. And I think mo st days I 
did, but the teachers thought my Hebrew
 education was sadl
y lack-lacking, and 
suggested that I have some extra lessons. 
And my mother arranged for me to have 
them after school. Inevitably the teacher 
would call and ask where I was. And my  
mother said, well isn™t she 
there? And no, she™s not here. I was roaming the city of
 
Colo gne
 and there were all these stores 
that had the signs in the window,
 Juden 
[indecipherable]
, meaning Jews not wanted . And th
at™s the line I would stand on, 
and they  were selling coffee with an eighth of a pound. And my  grandmother, my  
mother™s mother, was very ill. She had canc
er, and her only joy 
was a cup of coffee. 
So many afternoons I would come -- I w
ould have stood on five, six lines and I 
would have come home with a pound of 
coffee. That™s where I was, standing on 
line somewhere or taking the streetcar and go
ing to  a bakery and pick  up a piece of 
cake for my grandmother. But I never told
 anybody where I was going. I was just 
roaming the city and I -- 
I always got back home.

Q: Before 
Kristallnacht
, did you experience any ot
her anti-Semitic verbal or 
physical attacks on you? 
A: N-No . There was a lot of discussion at ho
me between the adults, but they tried to 
shield the children from
 it, so really, no. 
Q: When you say they tried to shie
ld you, how did they shield you? 
A: By not talking ab out any of their probl
ems in front of us. It was always hush 
hush. And th at™s why I have so few memo ries. 

Q: Were you aware that something was wrong? 
A: Yes, we always lived in fear. We di
dn™t have a normal life. We didn™t go on 
vacations, we didn™t go on picnics, we di
dn™t go to th e movies. It was not a normal 
life as you would know it here.  

Q: Did your fami ly ever think of leaving 
Germany
, even if -- I™m talking about 
before 
Kristallnacht
. 
A: Yes, my father very
 much wanted to leave 
Germany
 and he did have a visa 
application number y -- thateverybody had to have, a 
quota number. But the quota 
numbers were very, very hi
gh for Germans at that time,
 and there was very little 
hope for us. We were work ing on it, but it 
didn't go as fast as you think it would.

Q: In the time before 
Kristallnacht, 
do you reme mb er any book burnings, or do 
you remember any of the -- w -- you™re shak
ing your head, I can™t -- I can™t pick 
that up on th e microphone. 
A: Sorry. No, no, not at all. No. I was a 
little girl. No. We li -- we w ere sheltered. 
My parents sheltered us. My 
sister™s memories are so di
fferent. She remembers that 
she was never allowed out. Sh e was younger a
nd they  kept her hidden, they kept her 
indoors. I just went out on my  own. 

Q: Is there anything else that comes to
 your mind about the period of time before 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: Very vague, small things that I really
 can™t put together to make any sense. 
Q: Were you able to 
see or hear anything on 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: Oh yes, definitely. I 
-- my  parents, living outside
 Colo gne
, and I don™t think 
radios were very much in use at that time, 
sen t me to sch ool that day. And I went to 
school the way I usually did and when  I 
got to the school, the -- the Gestapo or 
police, I don™t rememb er, I ca -- I still can™
t tell the difference between one and the 
other, were standing in front of the school
 with German Shepherd s. And they  told 
us, children there is no school today, go 
home. And the school was right next door 
to a beautiful synagogue, and we could see 
that the roof of the synagogue was burnt 
out. And we went home -- we got on th e train, went home, and wh en  I got home my

mo ther said, well, what are you doing here? 
And I said, well, th-they sent us home. 
They  said there was no school today. It
 mu st have been 11 - 12 o™clock in th e 
mo rning. That time my uncle had a very 
good school friend who came to the house 
and said to my family, whatev
er you see or hear today, do not leave your home. Just 
don™t leave the house. In other word s, he mu st have known  wh at was going to  

happen an d he told my uncle
 not to leave. So, around th ree, four o™clock in th e 
afternoon we hear that the synagogue is 
burning, the fire engines ran. We saw the 
smoke from the home. My cr -- grandfather 
had been president of
 the synagogue for 
over 20 years and th -- his natural thing wa
s to run to th e synagogue to save the 
books, to save the Torahs. 
But my father and uncle woul
d not let him leave. And we 
saw all this and we decided -- my  grandmot
her at that time had a broken ankle, so 
her leg was in a cast. S o  my parents de
cided it was time to get out. Every other 

Jewish male in the little town 
that we lived in, ran to th
e synagogue. They were all 
picked up and put in concen tration cam
p. My parents and my  uncle and three 
cousins who lived in  the next to
wn  over, all decided to  go to  
Co log n e
. These are all 
the people that filed into this apartm
ent. And a non-Jewish man drove us, my  
grandparents, my  sister and I, drove us to 
Colo gne
. We had to sit on the floor of the 
car, and we were sittin g on 
my grandmother™s cast. We 
were not allowed to look 
out the window. And he drove us to 
Co log n e
 and that™s how we left, my parents,

uncle, went to the next to
wn over to pick up anot
her aunt and uncle and my  
grandmother, who was very 
ill. And we also came --
 they also came to 
Cologne. 
And when the man that drove us came back
 to the town wher
e we lived, he was 
severely beaten for having driv en us to 
Co log n e
. In that way there were many 
people that were very close to us. My 
grandfather was a very well-respected man. 
He did business in -- all over. He helped ma
ny people, he loaned th em money, he 
set them up in busin ess, Jews and non-Jews
, and he was very well respected. As a 
matter of fact, when we went back this pa
st summer, we went to a castle, and I think 
the lady that lives in the castle now is th
e granddau ghter of the man that ran my 
parent™s business from 1933 to ™39. He wa
s, of course, a non-Jew. Jews weren™t 
allowed to do business, and turn ed  over a
ll the funds to my family. And this lady 
invited us for coffee, and sh e also has th
ese vague memo ries of things that -- my 
grandparents never spoke ab out it, a -- becau
se my family™s grazing lands abutted 
the castle™s property, and they must have 
been  very , very  good friends. Was trying 
to rememb er, there was something I wanted 
to say before and I forgot it of course. 
Q: What kind of business 
was your grandfather in? 
A: Same business. What -- what -- the busin
ess consisted of my  uncle and his -- my  
father and his brother, my  uncle; and three 
cousin s that were also brothers, had the 

same bus -- were in business togeth
er where my  uncle would go to east
 Prussi a

buy cattle, have it transported by train to the 
Colo gne
 area, put it in this pastureland 
or in the stables, and then sell the l -- catt
le to the dealers -- to
 the farmers in the 
area. S -- and my  grandfather had that business and my  father and uncles took it 
over. And the three brothers and the two brot
hers, were always in business together. 
[coughing]
. Sorry. 
Q: After 
Kristallnacht
, what was next for you and your family? 
A: Well, we piled into this apartment a
nd my  father, his brother and one of the 

cousins were terrified about being picked 
up and put into  concentration camp s. So 
for three or four nights they would 
sleep during the day and drive thro ugh 
Co log n e
 
at night in order not to be 
picked  up. The only thing they
 did was stop fo r gas. They  
did this for -- well,
 Kristallnacht
 was on a Thursd ay, they 
did it Frid ay during the 
day, Frid ay night was 
Shabbat
 and they stayed home shab
 -- and they were hiding, 
because the m -- there were 
very few men around of thei
r age. And they started 
doing th is again Sunday, and I think Monday
 and Tuesday. And then they tried to 
go across the border into
 Holland
, illegally. And of course they were caught and 
sent back. And tried -- a day or so later 
they tried again and th ey managed to get 
across the border, but were pi
cked up by Dutch police th
at were friendly to the 
Nazis. And they info
rmed the Nazis and they put 
them in prison. They were 
imprisoned. And as I said earlier, 
my  uncle and aunt had gone to 
Holland
 already.

And with  the assistance of highly prominent people in 
Holland
, that had 
connections to the queen, etcet
era, they were able to a
rrange that they were not 
being sent -- that they would not be sent 
back. So -- and they we
re put into  a camp, 
which was kind of like restri
cted. They were not allowed 
out, but they were not in 
prison. And they were ther
e from Novemb er ™38 to  May 1939. We did not see my  
father in all that time, we had no contact
 with  h im. And my  mo
ther then handled -- 
my  mo ther and my  au nts handled all 
the emig ration things because after
 
Kristallnacht
, they m -- the Jews were
 told that they had 
to go and clean up the 
mess. And my  mo ther went back  and she lo ok
ed at it and she said, I™ll never do that. 
The Persian carpets were on 
the manure heap . The prayer books were full of eggs. 
We still have some of them -- show you. 
And it was very, very difficult, but many -- 
not many, but several of the non-Jewish fa
milies came to her aid and helped her. 
And of co urse, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from 

the land would come with baskets to
 Co log n e
 to bring us food. As a matter of fact, 
they knew  we would only ea
t kosher chickens, one wo man came every week with a 
live chicken on the bus, to 
Cologne
. And two of my  uncles were 
Shochten
, they 
had learned that, so that way we had ou
r kosher chickens. You see, we -- we 
weren™t -- we really did not any -- have 
any deprivations in that way, because 
people helped us.

Q: You said your mother handled the emig
ration work, what kind
 of work was she 
doing at this point? 
A: Well, she didn™t do it alone, there was he
r sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and 
one of my  unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin
 -- two of the three brothers that were 
cousins were still in 
Germany
, so they all had -- worked on it together. But you 
have to rememb er, we had a 17 room house.
 It was fully furnished, that you could 

find on the street. Linens, cl
othing, everything in that house was smashed. There 
wasn™t a single piece that was left togethe
r. And at that time my mother went and 
bought a comp lete ha -- n-new fu rniture, 
dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens. She 
bought ev erything new. She knew she was 
not allowed to take 
out any money when  
she left 
Germany
. And everything she bought had to  be
 paid to the store, had to be 
documented, and the same amount of m
oney had to be paid to the German 
government for export tax. And I would sa
y 75 percent of the st
uff that she bought 
was on a boat to come to 
Africa
 when the British bombed it in
 the -- in the port of 
Hamburg
. And I think if you lo ok at the bottom, you™ll still find it there. So I 
would say 75 percent of the stuff she 
bought never -- never got to us.  

Q: Why 
Africa
? 
A: It™s a long story. 
America
 wouldn™t let us in and my -- one of the cousins was 
married to a woman who had a cousin
 who had, I think studied law in  
England
.

And he was hired by the 
Kenya
 government as an attorney in 
Kenya.
 And he -- and 
it was still relatively easy to get into 
Kenya
. And he sent affidavit for 17 people. At 
the time, I think you had to deposit 50 pounds
 per person as an entry fee. And after 
the war started -- we arrived in 
Kenya
 on June first, the war started September first. 
After the war started that fee was up to 250
 pounds. But we were lucky, we got in. 
My father and uncles went -- got ther
e four weeks earlie r. They went from 
Holland
 
to 
England
 to 
Kenya
. We went from 
Germany
 by train via
 Switzerland
 to  
Italy
, 
and then  we went to 
Kenya
, on a German ship that se
rved us kosher food. Talk 
about being ironic. 

Q: What were you personally able to
 take with you when  you left? 
A: My clothes. That™s about it. Clothing. 

Q: No books or toys? 

A: No, th ey were all gone in 
Kristallnacht
. 
Q: Were you able to say goodbye? 
A: Yes. That was one of the saddest days 
of -- the saddest things that I remember, 
because a -- all the aunts and the uncles and 
any relatives and friends all came to the 
station in 
Co log n e
, the railroad station, to say good
bye. And we didn™t know that 
we wouldn™t see them again, 
but it was a very, very sad pa
rting. Very sad. Cousins, 
uncles, aunts. It was really very trauma
tic. And of course, we
 never saw any of

 and they got perm

A: As a nine year old, I don™t think I 
had any. I was happy that we would be 
together with my father ag
ain, and I think I was happy that we would be free to 
speak and run around again. Bu t other 
-- other than that, I personally had no 
expectations. 
Q: Did you have any regrets about leaving 
Germa ny
? 
A: Oh no, none. None whatsoever. 

Q: What were your first impressions of your new home? 
A: Lovely. Strange, of course, with all 
the flowers and greenery all year round. 
Different people. Africans and their livi
ng quarters and habits. Having to sp eak 
English, wh ich we didn™t know a word  ab
out. Not being able to understand a single 
word. But that was very quickly rectified.
 I think after being there two days, we 
were in English schools. And that was ve
ry traumatic. N ew country, new school, no 
language. I was in fourth or fifth grade and 
I had to start again in first grade. And -- 
but it wen -- and that was very upsetting 
to me to be put ba
ck with the small 
children. Bu t we learned English very ra
pidly. It wasn™t English as a second 
language. We were pushed into it, we 
learned. And ev ery two weeks I was put up 
until I was with my grade level. And I rememb
er that the first, second day, having 
to come home to learn  a poem by heart. 
And not only couldn™t -- I could -- didn™t I 

understate
 it, couldn™t read it. And my  70 year old grandmother said, come child, I

will learn it with you. She couldn™t read it.
 B u t between the two of us, we learned it 
by heart and by the time I got to school, I knew it by heart, but I couldn™t -- I 

couldn™t say it because I couldn™t -- I didn't 
k n ow how to pronounce it. I could read 
it. I knew it by heart, but I could -- couldn™t
 pronounce it. But that -- those things 
were very quickly rectified and we were
 very happy in school. The children all 
wore uniforms so it was all -- we were a
ll the same. And it worked out very well.  
Q: What was your family™s legal status? 

A: We were enemy aliens. It wa
s really ironic. We had left 
Germany
 -- I have to 
think a minute. We had left 
Germany
 as stateless. Jew s were no longer considered 
Germans, so we were stat
eless. And we arrived in 
Kenya
, which at that time w as a 
British colony, and I d
on™t know under what quota, 
under what auspices, but the 
day war broke out, we were 
considered enemy aliens. And it was rather strange, but 
that™s what we were and we were enemy 
alien -- we were stateless until we came to 
America
 in 1947, when we came under the Ge
rman quota. Again we were put -- at 
that point considered Germans.  
Q: What did it mean for you, fo r 
your family, to be enemy aliens? 
A: They laughed about it because it was so ir
o -- ironic. The -- the thing that it real -
- that it meant physically was, my parent
s bought a very, very large farm in -- a 
ranch in 
Kenya
. And what it came down to  was we
 were interned on the property.

We were not allowed to leave the property
 without permission. Any time we wanted 
to go to town -- every 
week we had to go to 
Nairobi
, which was 20 miles aw ay. We 
lived in the 
highlands in 
Limuru
, we had to  go buy groceries. We had to go to th e 
police department and ge
t permission to go to 
Nairobi
 and buy groceries. And -- 
but otherwise it was not a problem. But in
 the beginning, when  we -- when  war 
broke out, everybody was very upset and we
 were then declared enemy aliens and 
the British came with the A-African soldiers
 to arrest my -- all the men that had 
now come to freedom in 
Kenya
, were arrested, including my 80 year old 
grandfather. And they were 
taken to a place of internment for security. And my  
grandmother at that point said to the 
British whoever he was, police officer, she 
said, now I want you to know so mething. We fled 
Germany
 to safety, to come 
here. I have been married to this man for 
45 years and wh ere he goes, I go. So if 
you™re going to take my  80 year old husb
and, I™m going to go with him, he™s not 
going to  be alone. He looked  at my gra
ndmother, he says, okay, we™ll leave him 
here. And the men were there one or two 
nights and they came ba
ck. They realized 
what was going on and look
ed into  their background an
d they were released. We 
were, at that time, still living in a ho -- 
in a house that my  father had rented in
 
Nairobi
, and that was before we had purchased the ranch. Afterwards, they made it

mandatory that the men help
 the war effort, and manage the ranches of the British 
that had gone to war. My uncle 
became a manager of a farm.  
Q: For you as a young 
person, what kind of social lif
e did you have in your new 
home? 
A: None. None whatsoever. First we lived 
on the farm, and my parents realized  we 
needed to be educated
, so they hired tutors for us. Th
e tutors lived in, but we were 
mu ch too rambunctious to stay with tutors
. We did not -- it did not work  out. And 
another thing th at happened  was in 
Africa
 we grew pyrethrum, which -- of which 
DDT
 is ma de. And that was a big busin ess at
 that time because 
it was sold -- it was 
needed for the wa
r effort, because
 America
 used to get its 
DDT
 from 
Japan
, and 
they couldn™t get it any more. And my mother
 was terribly, terribly allergic to it. 

Her face would break out
 and her skin would break. It 
was just awful. So sh e could 
not live on the farm, and th e 
tutor business didn™t wo rk  ou
t. S o  my  mo th er an d my  
sister and I moved to  
Na iro b i
 to town so we -- we coul
d go to school. The first 
semester or so we mo ved to another place in 
Limuru
, and we had to walk down  a 
hill, cross the little riv er and up a hill to go
 to school. But we didn™t stay there too 
long. And my father, uncle and grandparen
ts -- on the ranch that we bought there 
were two large homes. The three brothers 
and families liv ed in one and my father 
and uncle and grandparents, a
nd we lived in the other. Th
at had been the quarter --

the -- the laborers quarters before we bo
ught the farm, and it was very, very dirty 
and it had no inside plumbing. And well, 
cleaned it up, and we mo ved in. And -- but 
after awhile my mother coul
dn™t live there, and we moved away. My father would 
come to us on weekends. And we we
nt to school. First we went to 
Limuru  
girls™ 
school as day students, whic
h was one of the mo st excl
usive board ing schools there 
was. Don™t forget, we were in a British co
lony, and they all had boarding schools. 
Then we went to 
Na iro b i
 and we went to school 
there. We went to the 
Nairobi
 
girls™ high school. Again,
 very exclusive school. 
[coughs]
 Excuse me. And we 
stayed there until we gra -- graduated fro
m high school. And my father stayed on 
the farm and worked the farms an d came to
 see us on weekends. In addition to that, 
money was not plen tiful, so 
we had rented a home in 
Nairo b i
 and my mother rented 
out rooms to augment her income. And that
™s what we did for many, many years.  

Q: Did you have to get special permission to
 -- to -- to move there and have your 
father come visit? 
A: This was after the war. 
Q: Oh, okay.  

A: Wait a minute. That™s not true. No, this
 was during the war. I™m sure they did. 
I™m sure they did, but I don™t 
think it became  a -- any trouble. 
Q: Did an ybody there ask you about your life in 
Germany
?

A: Yes, many in  the Jewish community . 
There was a nice Jewish community in 
Nairobi
 and people that had been there 20 - 30 
years, and yes they did ask us. But 
we were absorbed in
to the community, it wa
s really -- liv ing in 
Na iro b i
 was very, 
very pleasant. 
Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism there? 

A: No, not to my kn
owledge or memory. 
Q: Did you expect to st
ay there indefinitely? 
A: Not really. I don™t think my parent
s had that intention because there was 
basically no 
Yiddishkeit
. There were no -- there were no -- I don™t think there were 
any other Orthodox Jews, except one or 
two families that had also come as 
immigrants. And again, it was very difficult 
to keep  any of the 
observance. So after 
the war my father was anxious 
to leave, so that we -- that
 the children could at least 
be integrated into an  Orthodox community.  

Q: So th e Jewish community 
that was there -- you said it was a -- it was a lovely 
Jewish community, where were those people
 from and wh at kinds of traditions did 
they follow? 

A: Their traditions today would be con -- 
considered Conservative Judaism. Where 
were they from? From 
Poland
, from
 England
, from all o v er the world. From 
Somalia
, from all over the world. Some were refugees like we were, others were

older residents that -- I don™t know where th
ey came from, but they  had been th ere 
for years and years; they were well esta
blished. But mo st of them had Po lish 
backgrounds, so I as -- assump
tion at this stage loo -- in 
retrospect is, maybe their 
parents left under the pogrom
s and settled wherever they could. That™s retrospect. 
Q: How carefully did you fo llow what was going on in 
Germany
 and in 
Euro pe
? 
A: My parents and uncle did 
as much as they could. Wh
ile we were on the farm, we 
had no electricity, but we did 
have a radio that was battery run. It was only allowed 
to be used  for the news, and my  uncle and 
parents followed that very, very closely. 
They  were very concerned ab out the people 
they had left behind. We did get some 
mail from them through the Red Cross. Th
ey  did receive some packages that we 
had sent, but then after awhile all correspon
dence stopped, and th
ey were very, very 
concerned, but there wa
s nothing we could do. 
Q: Did you have any id ea what
 was happening to  the Jews in 
Europe
? 
A: We had an inkling th at things were ve
ry, very bad, but rea
lly exactly what was 
going on, no. At least -- as teenagers, we 
were off in another world. But my parents 
and uncles had ideas, but really 
didn™t know what was going on.

A: My parents had ideas, possibly were ab
le to read through the lines what was 
going on, but actually no, we
 did not know until after 
th e war, what was going on. 
Q: So when did you find out? 
A: What I remember -- I think I was either
 16 or 17 -- the war was over in ™45, so I 
was 16, and at that time -- and came here
 when I was 17, so
 when we left 
Kenya
, 
someone gave my  father a book of pictur
es of the camps. It was a very new book 
and it was horrendous. It was a h o rrendous b
ook, he wouldn™t let us look at it. And I 
reme mb er he stood on the end of the ship
, he threw it overboard. He could not see 
it, he could not live with  those pictures. 

Q: Before I have you leaving 
Africa
, are there any other memo ries that you have 
that stand out, or any other experiences that you™d like to share? 

A: Well, we became much ha
ppier, we went to the movies. We met other young 
people of our age. It was a -- it was a ha
ppier time, but cannot be comp ared to 
American teenagers life. And I had just gra
duated high school, my sister was sti ll in 
school, and that™s about the time we left. 
Q: And why did you leave at -- 
at that moment, that time? 
A: We got -- at that time we had received 
our visas and it was time to go. Trip was 
very long, it was seven weeks on a cargo 
boat, and was a long trip. We stopped -- 
we stopped in every port from 
Mombassa

Kenya
, down to

Town. 
It was a cargo boat that took on -- was a ve
ry interesting trip for us. We went 
ashore. Actually, I™ve be
en into  every port from 
Cairo
 to 
Ca pe Town
. Coming -- 
co min g  from 
Germany
 we stopped in -- up there, and went through the
 Daman 
Isle
, and round -- around 
Aden , 
we stopped in 
Aden
 and th en came down, stopped 
in 
Somalia
 at that time, a
nd then down to 
Kenya
. And th en seven years later we 
continued from
 Kenya
 to all the small ports. Port
 Elizabeth, Durbin
, and th en 
Cape Town, 
and th en -- that took four week s.
 The trip fr-from -- that -- because 
they stopped so mu ch. And th
en it was three weeks up the 
Atlantic
 without a stop, 
to 
Boston.
 And at the end of that trip there 
was such a horrendou
s storm, that we 
were walking on the walls of the boat. Wasn
™t a dish left in the kitchen that was 
whole. The storm was so bad outside of 
Bo sto n ,
 that a-although our tickets were for 
New York,
 they wouldn™t take us to 
New York
, they said you have to leave in 
Boston
, and we took a train to 
New York
. And for -- for my si
ster and myself it 
was a wonderful trip. We did ev erything on 
th at boat. From keeping the logs, from 
steering the ship, from swabbi
ng the decks. We did ev erything. We had a wonderful 
time. And no fo od. No  kosher food. And 
we had taken some 
food along, and the 
funniest thing is, after the first day or two 
my mother refused to 
eat the bread. Why? 
The baker of the boat had a monkey that 
he dipped in the water every day and then

saw that, she got so disgusted 
sh e wouldn™t eat the bread.  
Q: When did you arrive in the

? 
A: In February, 1948. Snow 
over the houses. No winter 
coats. Having lived in the 
tropics for seven years. Oh

V e ry  co ld . 
Q: Did you have any expectations about the 
United States
? 
A: Not really. Not really, because you know
, we just took it day by day. Wh atev er 
we had to  do, we did. I started school. 
Q: Where? 

A: 
Queen™s Plaza
, went to stenography school to 
become a secretary, and after a 
few weeks I decided I knew enough and I wa
nted a job and th e only job I wanted 
was on 
Fifth 
Av enue. And I took the ﬁ
New York Timesﬂ
 and went from -- an d 
anything that was 
Fifth 
Av enue, I went in and applied for a job. I started way 
down town and walked my  way up. I 
think the first one I got was at 
23
rd
 Street, but I 
was so inexperienced, I didn
™t last longer than a w
eek there. So, took the ﬁ
New 
York Timesﬂ 
again and started from 
23
rd
 
Street up to 
43
rd
 
Street. And finally found 
-- was hired in an attorney™s office, 
where there were two attorneys and an 
accountant. I knew nothing. Finall
y, one of the men that hi
red me -- they must have 
felt sorry for me, said, do us a 
favor, go back to school, a

to night school in 
Queens
, worked in 
Manhattan
 and lived in
 Brooklyn
. I could 
have switched schools, but I didn™t. I was 
too -- too scared. I could have gone to 
college, because with the British education th
at we had, it was qui -- equivalent to 
the junior year in college. Didn™t do it. I 
had to work. We -- and I had that job for a 
long time and I told them I observe the Sa
bbath, and th e one attorn ey said -- would 
come to me every aftern -- Fr
iday afternoon, an hour befo
re sunset and say, it™s time 
for you to go home. Which I thou -- you 
know, it enabled me to be home befo re 
sunset. I -- finally I did learn shorthand an
d stenography and I was able to type. And 

I used to do spreadsheets fo
r the accountant, who was te
rribly fu ssy. He would hold 
my  work  up to the light and say, you erased, do it over. I learned to erase, he 
couldn™t tell any more. I worked there -- how
 long did I work there? A year, year 
and a half? Not -- yeah, til 1950, two year
s m -- year and a half, may b e. And by 
then my  parents had bought a chicken farm in 
Vinela nd
, 
New Jersey
. And I was 
living with an aunt and uncle in 
Brooklyn
. And we belonged to an  -- or -- or to a 
congregation there, and I made friends th
ere and met a lot of young people. And 
didn™t want to come -- move to 
Vineland
. And I somehow managed financially. I 
was on my  own. Wh en my  parents left for
 New Jersey, 
my father -- I was renting a 
room somewhere on the 
West Side
,
 96
th

 and uncle had moved 
to 
Brooklyn
. And my father left me with a hundr
ed dollars and he 
said, when that™s

finished, it™s yours. And from that day on, I 
was independent. I got a job, I paid my  
room and board. Subway was a nickel one 
way, so all you need is a dollar a week 
for subway, and I was on my 
own until 1950, when I -- ™
50? Yeah, end of 1950. I 
had met my  husband in the fall of 1
950 and moved -- and then moved to 
Vineland
 
and became engaged in Janua
ry of ™51. And then I 
st-started to work in 
Vineland
 
for an attorney who came to
 my  parents™ house and said, I hear you™re a legal 
secretary, can you come to work for me? And I did. And I worked for him til my 
first child was born. 
Q: Before I let you go any fu rt
her, I have a few questions that I wanted to go back 

to. When you came to this country, di
d anybody help you? Any of the Jewish 
agencies or anything like that? 

A: To my knowledge, we went to 
HIAS
 to fill out citizen papers, period. We had an 

uncle that lived here and a c
ousin  who owned a restaurant on 
49
th
 Street, his name 
was
 John Schwartz
. He owned
 Headquarters
 restaurant. He was 
Eisenhower™s 
mess sergeant in World War II. He did the 
Berlin
 conference for
 Eisenhower
 and 
he was with 
Eisenhower
 through the entire camp aign. And wh en he came back, he 
opened a restaurant in -- on 
49
th

New York City. 
So we had a lot of help 
from -- from the cousins.

out of the service. And he asked me for 
lunch the next day. Must have liked me, 
right? I went to lunch with him because to
 me it was a free lunch. I didn™t -- and 
from then on he kept wr
iting, he kept coming to 
New York
. And by the -- by the 
end of the year, the aunt and uncle th

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with
 Inge Katzenste in.
 This is tape number two, side
 
A.
 And you were talking about
 your husband courting you,
 but wh ile I was flipping 
the tape you rememb ered something th at you wanted to  add, with  respect to your 
experience in 
Africa
. 
A: I just wanted to say that in general we
 were very fortunate to be alive, because 
we left 
Germany
 before World War II, in June of 
™39, and we were able to leave
 
Kenya
 right before the 
Mau Mau
 uprising, be -- because had we stayed in
 Kenya
 
we would have been right in th e center of 
Ma u  Mau
 territory, and we -- the ranch 
that my  parents had bought was not sold at
 the time, it to ok several years to be able 
to sell it, and for us to be ab
le to transfer the funds from 
Kenya
 to here. 
Q: While you™re talking about the -- the 
ranch and the funds, how was your family 
able to afford to buy a ranch in 
Kenya
? 
A: Again, my family was ve
ry fortunate. On May 1, 19
33, one of my  uncles took 
large sums of money to 
Holland
 and banked them in 
Holland
, because after that it 
was mo re difficult to get money out.
 And that™s how we had fu nds in 
Holland
, 
which were then transferred to 
Africa
.

, and he -- he and his family 
[coughs]
 also left 
Germany
 in 1937 and lived in 
Holland
 until 1939, and were th
en able to come to 
America
. He will tell it in his story. And 
they purchased a farm outside of 
Camden, New Jersey
, and he will elaborate on that.And in 19 -- w-war broke out 
in 1942 for
 America
, right? ™41 - ™42. He was inducted in to the army in 1944, 
again, as an enemy alien and became a citiz
en in the army and then was sent back 
overseas to 
Germany
, first as an infantry so ldie
r. He was wounded, and after the 
war ended he went in to mini -- military govern ment as an interpreter. And I think he 
was discharged 40 -- in 1946, I™m not sure.

America

everyone, regardless of color, creed or natio

to that, our mother was 
in a nursing home in 
Atlantic City,
 about which we were 
not too happy, and we
 were able to have her transf

Greater
 Washington. 
And it was quite a long trip to visit her. The trip from
 
Vineland

 is about three hours. And we were retired, there was no 
reason for us to live in 
Vineland.
 Was mo re and mo re difficult to be observant Jews 
in 
Vineland,
 because the observant synagogues we

andchildren can™t read them any more. 
Some of them are in German scrip t that
 both my husband and I can still read. Some 

of them are very difficult to decipher 
and terribly heart-wrenching to read.  
Q: Have you had any u
nusual or dramatic experiences at the mu seum? 
A: No, not really, because we
 work behind the scenes. We
 don™t see the public. We 
go into the 
Ross
 building, have our little cubicle 
and spend our da
y there and go 
home. 

Q: Do you ever speak public
ly about your experiences? 
A: I used to speak to 
schoolchildren in -- in 
New J ersey , 
and I have done it once 
here because one of the teachers asked me 
to come to a class.
 Now, I™ve not done 
no s -- I have not done any s -- public speaking. 

Q: Have you ever return  -- well,
 you mentioned you returned to 
Germany
 since the 
war. 

A: Yeah. The first time we returned to 
Germany
 was at my  sister™s urging because 
the city of 
Colo gne
 invited us as their guests for a we
ek. I did not want to go but my 
sister said, come on, let™s 
go. And we did. It was a go
od week, it was a structured 
week. It was planned by the city. We were
 treated royally. Bu t I kept looking over

my shoulder to see who was following me. If I saw a German Shepherd, I ran. I was 
not a happy camper. This time we were in 
Europe
 for three weeks and we just 
spent four days in 
Germany
 because our son wanted to
 see, quote unquote, his 
roots. And he was able to fly over for four
 days, rent a car and 
we went to the town 

that my father was born in. We went to 
the town that my mo
ther was born in , and 
we went to the town wher
e our great-grandmother was bu
ried. And after that we 
really had enough of the 
a u toba hn
 and we went on to  
Holland
 and he went home. 
Q: On your second trip, the one that wa
s not structured, ho-how did you -- how 
were you treated by the people that you met? 

A: The only people that we really  met in 
Germany
 were hotel personnel, and we 
hadn™t -- th -- and then of course we were
 treated ex -- like royalty by th e people 
that had the castle. We were
 also treated extremely we
ll by the daughter of my  
aunt™s maid, who treated us like royalty
. Very sweet, very nice and -- extremely  
nice, but these people were nice to us befo
re. We didn™t meet any new ones. I had a 
-- I had an experience on th e fi
rst trip which really shocke
d me. We were at a dinner 
planned by the city, with teachers, becaus
e at that time w e had gone over and we 
spoke to classes in 
Germany
. And one of the teachers sitting next to me, she says, I 
have to admit to you, my  mo ther is a Nazi 
to this day. I was speechless. So anybody 
I saw that was my age or older, 
I considered to be a Nazi.

Q: I have to ask you about a Torah scroll.
 You have not mentioned it, but I would 
like you to tell me about it. 

A: Oh, okay. The two cousins 
that stayed behind to th
e very end were able to 
purchase a -- that -- a Torah scroll that wa
s saved from one of the synagogues and 
they brought it to 
Kenya
. In 
Kenya
 we used it because we had serv ices on the 
holid ays. The family had five adult male
s and during the war my  mo ther ha-had 
many, many Jewish soldiers, from 
England
, from 
Africa, 
from -- from 
South 
Africa
, from 
America
, that would come for rest a
nd recuperation to our farm. And 
so for the holiday
s they always kept -- if they were still in 
Kenya
, we™d always 
come back. And the Tora
h scroll was used in 
Kenya
 all the time. W h en we came to 
America
, a Torah scroll was used in a sm
all country synagogue outside of
 
Vineland
, called
 Brockmanville.
 And wh en we left the area, we took th e Torah 
scroll with us again. It is not kosher 
any mo re, it cannot be used as a s -- Torah 
scroll. So not knowing what 
to do with it, not wanting to
 bury it, we donated it as a 
gift to 
KMS
 synagogue in 
Silver Spring, 
who gratefully accepted it and built a 
beautiful 
orann
 for it, and it s-stands in their 
bet-hamek
 in the small synagogue, 
and it is taken out once a year on 
Simcha s 
Torah, when everybody  dances with it. 
And I feel that is a beautiful place for it 
because it™s still being used for what it was 
intended for.

Q: Is there anything that we have not co
vered that you would like to add before we 
conclude today? 
A: Yes. I have to say I don™t -- did I 
say it before about not being survivors? 
Q: Say whatever you™d like, it™s okay. 

A: I may have mentioned this befo re, that 
we wi -- feel v ery fortunate to be alive 
and to be able to live in freedom in
 America
, to raise our children to be Orthodox 
Jews, and to be able to spend our later ye
ars of -- being to  some advantage to the 
museum of being able to do the transl
ations, even though they are very , very 
difficult at times to do. And some Mondays
 we come home quite depressed. But 
then life goes on and things get better. 
Q: Well, I™d like to thank you very much
 for speaking with me today and this 
concludes the 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Inge 
Katzenstein
. Thank you. 
A: Think I mentioned -- I think I was -- I rep eated myself.
