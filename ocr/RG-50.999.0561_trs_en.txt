[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Esther, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us and your willingnes s  to s har e your
 
Firs t 
Person
 
ac c ount with all of us, inc luding with family  m em bers. Som e have been here befor e, per
haps  
others who have not. So welc ome to all of you.
 
We only have a s hor t hour, Es ther , so we'r e going to 
jum p r ight in.
 
 
You wer e very young when your  parents s ent you to England. Although you wer e too young to 
be able to tell us firs thand about life in Germ any for your fam ily at that time, per haps  you c an give us  a 
s ens e of Adels heim  and your  fam ily dur ing that time befor e Kr istallnac ht and your par ents ' profound 
dec is ion to s end their  c hildren away to s afety.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  As you know from the pictur e, I was  c learly the younges t. I was  just over 2 when I 
was  s ent on the Kindertrans por t so I don't r eally rem ember this  stuff. But I have s pent a gr eat deal of 
m y life trying to find out m ore about my fam ily. So I will s har e with you.
 
 
My father and fam ily had been in that ar ea of Germany s inc e 1730. They were longtime 
r es idents of that area. My father had been in the Firs tWorldWar and had los t a leg in the Fir stWorld 
War. So though he had been tr ained to be a baker, he c ouldn't do that bec aus e he c ouldn't s tand that 
long. So he s old gr ain to people loc ally and oc c as ionally would ar range a trade of a hor s e or  a c ow.
 
My m other helped him a lot with the work bec ause he c ouldn't always  m anage by him s elf with the 
ar tific ial leg.
 
 
I had, as you know fr om the
 
pic tur e
 
--
 
ther e wer e five of us.When Hitler c ame to power , m y 
s is ter s c ould no longer go to s c hool in that ar ea. So the thr ee oldes t girls  went firs t to live with fam ily, 
bec aus e both m y par ents  c am e fr om fam ilies  of 10 s o there wer e a lot of people ar ound. They went to 

s c hool. Then that didn't wor k out and they went to
 
--
 
I forget. They went to a differ ent plac e. I c an't think 

3 
 
of the nam e
 
--
 
Aac hen, to go to sc hool. My brother stayed hom e and I stayed home. My br other was  
about 4, 5, 6 and I was  jus t a 
baby.
 
 
When
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we get to Kris tallnac ht, you'r e five c hildren and a s ignific ant age differenc e. 
Bertle is  12 year s  older than you?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So as you tried to piec e together as  m uc h as  you c an, has
 
Bertle been able to help 
with her 
memories
?  Becaus e s he was  older at that time.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yes, Bertle has helped. When we wer e growing up
 
--
 
bec aus e when we c am e to 
this  countr y, whic h I will get to later , I lived with Ber tle and m y s isters. She would talk about it som e but 

not m uc h. You had to ask  the r ight questions  to get m y s is ters  to tell you anything. And if you don't 

know anything, it's  hard to ask the r ight ques tions. So we had a few standard stories we knew
 
and w
e 
would as k  that.
 
E ver y
 
onc e in a while s omething els e would c ome out. 
 
 
But m y older s is ter, Bertle, is  s till alive. The thr ee in the middle ar e not aliv e anymore. And 
Bertle is  now 90. And every onc e in a while now s he'll c om e out and tell m e s om ething that happened 

in 
Germ any. And I don't know if it's tr ue anym or e bec aus e what s he tells  m e now is  not always  tr ue. So 
I have no idea.
 
The other day s he told m e
 
--
 
I k now Bertle was bor n in the hous e where my parents 
lived at the tim e. And I k now I was  born in the hous e where they lived when I was  bor n. And s he said, 

ﬁW
ell, you were born at hom e bec aus e they c ouldn't s end you to a hos pital.
ﬂ 
I had no idea if anybody 
went to a hospital to be born in thos e days  but I don't know and s he's  never  s aid that befor e. 
 
 
But, whic h I'll tell you later, ther e's a man in Adels heim  who has  done a lot of r es ear c h. And 
when I don't know s omething, I often s end him a note. So I have to r em ember to s end him  a note and 

as k  him was  it c om mon for  people to be bor n at home then. I have no idea. I pr obably c ould do s ome 

r es earc h. It's eas ier  to ask  Reinhar t.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll hear  m or e about Reinhart later.
 
 
Pr ior  to Kr istallnac ht 1938, your  father  lost his bus ines s .What do you know about that?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  That's ver y inter es ting bec a
us e jus t rec ently
 
--
 
well, in the las t c ouple of years , I 
got a whole pac k  of paper s  fr om s om eone that I volunteer for at the m useum. It was  all about the c our t 

c as e that dealt with my father and m y m other and the bus ines s  they had. Som eone was  s uing my 
fa
ther  s aying he had s old them a bad hors e. It went to c our t. I've had it loos ely trans lated. I don't read 
Germ an. It went to c ourt and they found in favor of the man who brought the s uit. So m y par ents  had to 

pay the c ourt cas es. They didn't get the c ow back . And es s entially it ended their bus ines s . But it was  at 
a tim e when J ewis h bus ines s es  wer e being forc ed to c los e s o there pr obably was  not m uc h truth in the 

c as e. It was just a way to get at my parents and to get their bus ines s.
 
 
So by the tim e I was bor
n 
--
 
bec aus e this was  in 1937. By the tim e I was  born, they r eally had 
no way of making a living. Their bus ines s  was  gone. And then they had me. I s houldn't think they wer e 
s o happy to see me.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Anyhow.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  No
vember
 
1938, Kristallnac ht. Kris tallnac ht c onvinc ed m any German J ews , inc luding 
your  parents, that life under  the Nazis  had bec ome intoler able and pr obably was  going to get wors e. Do 
you know m uc h about the impact Kristallnac ht had on your  par ents  or any o
ther fam ily members ?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I do. And, again, m ost of this  c am e from Reinhart. Adels heim  is  a very sm all plac e, 

s till a s m all plac e. It has  one traffic light, s o you know it's  small. If you go there
, 
you c an't find things  to 
buy
,  
for other  people either.
 
 
What Reinhart told me is that people c ame fr om one village to another and they picked up 
people in eac h village. And then Adels heim, they s mashed the s ynagogue, took out the Bibles  and 
things and took  them to the s ports  c enter and burned them.
 
They als o dr agged Jewis h m en, 
par tic ular ly, out of their hous es  and beat them .
 
 
Now, my parents' hous e was  a little off the main area, s o they were not affec ted partic ular ly by 
that.
 
My sis ter s wer e in Aac hen at that time living with my two aunts. And unlike today where you know 

4 
 
ever ything that's happening in the world alm os t immediately, they set off to sc hool the next day and 
pas s ed the s ynagogues  bur ning and wer e told to go home.
 
 
My s is ters  have never told me if they went back to s c hool a
fter  that. I r eally  don't know 
bec aus e they left in Mar c h, s o ther e were s ever al m onths. I don't know.
 
 
Did your m other  ever tell you?
 
> > [Inaudible]
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Ok . We don't know about that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  On that night, whic h was  jus t this horr ific  night in 1938, over  300 s ynagogues in 
Germ any wer e burned. If I remem ber right, the one in Adels heim  was  not burned. Do you have any 
idea why they did not burn the s ynagogue in Adels heim ? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin: Well, it was  s tone s o it m ight have been
 
har d to bur n. And I think it was  c onnected 
to s om e other bus ines s es .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That may have c onnec ted to Germ an, non
-
J ewis h bus ines s es .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah. I don't know how m any people they c ollec ted by the time they c ame to 

Adels heim . Reinhart s aid a c ouple of people joined them  but not big masses  of people. But ther e 
weren't big m as s es of people in Adels heim.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And for the audienc e, on that one night, tens  of thous ands of J ewis h men wer e 

ar r ested and put into c onc entr ation c
amps .
 
 
In light of that, s oon after that, in 1939, your  par ents  m ade this  extraordinary dec is ion to s end 
their daughters on the Kindertrans port to England. Fir st, tell us what a Kinder tr ans port was  and then tell 

us  what you c an fr om what you've piec ed together about going on the Kinder trans port yourself as  well 
as  your s is ter s.
 
> > Esther  Star obin: Well, not too many c ountr ies  wanted to take in people from  Germ any. In England a 
group of people went to the par liam ent and asked them if they would take in c hildr en, and they dec ided 
they would. It was  J ewis h organizations  and Quaker s  that went partic ularly. And c hildren were allowed 
into England with c ertain
 
--
 
they had to be tr avel alone, under 17, and they wer e s uppos ed to be poor, I 
think . I was  younger than 
whatever the thing s aid. Som ebody had to pay s om e money. And they had to 
guar antee they wer e not going to stay in England.
 
 
So people from England went to Germ any and with Germ ans  organized the Kinder tr ans port. 
They had to pay I think
 
--
 
it was  like
 
$50, whic h is  a lot of m oney now, for  the c hildr en to leave. There 
was  s om e money involv ed in it. And then they c ould travel to England.
 
There were people who left fr om 
Czec hoslovakia, Poland. I think ther e were s ome other c ountr y. I don't r emember.
 
> > Bill B ens
on:  I think Aus tr ia.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Austria. And my s is ters  were s till in Aac hen s o they didn't get to s ee their par ents  
to s ay goodbye.
 
 
A c ouple of stor ies  fr om that. Ber tle tells  m e
 
--
 
first of all, they weren't told until a couple of 
days  before
 
they wer e leaving that they were leav ing. And if you think as  kids  today
 
--
 
I m ean, m y s is ter 
was  13 and s he didn't know?  It's  hard for m e to unders tand all of this. A
nd if s he didn't know, I gues s  
the other two didn't know either. I don't r ea
lly know. B
ut s he had her  ear s  pier c ed becaus e pier c ing your  
ear s  was  s uppos ed to help your  eyes . And s he never wore glasses s o I gues s  it helped.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  She does n't r em em ber  anything or  at least s he's never told me anything about the 
ac tual trip on the train. My s is ter  Edy, who loved food, r em em bers  when they c r os s ed the line out of 
Germ any getting or anges  and c hoc olates. But that was  Edith. She als o r emember ed when they were in 
Aac hen, they would walk ac r oss  the bor der and come back  with extr a underpants on and ther e would 

be c hoc olates in ther e, among other things.
 
 
So it's hard to know they really didn't talk  about it. It was  pretty cus tomary people didn't talk 
about thes e things. I don't know that they were as ham ed but the people where you were living, where 
you went didn't want to hear  about it. And c ertainly when they came to this c ountry, they wanted to 
m ove on and be Am er ic ans . And Am er ic ans  didn't talk about it. I m ean times  have c hanged a lot.
 

5 
 
 
So what I don't know
 
--
 
two things  I don't know. One thing Karla would like to know.Why did 
they s end m e and not her  father  who was  four years  older and didn't need
 
all of this  tender loving car e I 
 
obvious ly needed
? 
And how did I get fr om Adelsheim to wher e the tr ain was
? 
Well, ther e is
 
a tr ain, but 
who took  c are of m e?  Who took  c are of m e on the boat?  How did I get there?  And that s eems  to be 
s om ething almost im poss ible to find out. It's a big empty s pace in my life not knowing. I mean, I know 
how I got fr om London to m y fos ter fam il
y. That I know. But it's the in between part that I don't k now.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you were s aying, your s is ter, Ber tle and pr obably the other s , up until r ight 
before they left, they weren't told. And then they are put on the tr ain. And bec aus e one of
 
the c onditions  
was  that the expec tation was  you wouldn't s tay, it mus t have been thought this  was tem porar y at that 

tim e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin: Well, my parents  did
 
--
 
we'll get to it later  but we had letter s  fr om  m y m other. In the 
fir s t few letter s s he th
ought s he would join us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You did not go with your  thr ee s isters. You went s epar ately. Why do you think  that 
was ?  Any ins ight into that whats oever ? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I often wonder
 
--
 
again, it's something I'll never know. Did the aun
ts arrange for  m y 
s is ter s ?  I think my aunts wer e m uc h
 
--
 
I don't really know a lot about m y par ents. But my aunts r an a 
nightc lub, s o I think  they wer e m or e worldly than my parents .
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Esther  Star obin:  I don't know if they arr anged for Bertle, Edith, and Ruth. I don't know who arr anged 
it and I don't know if you c an find that out.
 
 
There are a lot of things  that I don't know. And as I lear n m ore, and I've learned an awful lot 
s inc e I've been doing this , ther e ar e mor e and mor e questions  I have. I always  thought, well, I was  on 
the Kindertrans por t, I went, I lived here, I lived ther e, and that's  the end of the s tor y. But as I get older 

and have m or e time to think about it, it's  not the end of the s tor y. 
 
 
So I don't know if they arr anged it a
nd I don't know
 
--
 
I've met over  the years  other people in 
the Kindertrans por t. A lot of them  seem to c ome from  families  who wer e muc h m ore educ ated than m y 
fam ily. If m y parents  went to s ixth or  eighth grade it was  big
 b
ut c ame fr om fam ilies  whos e parents
 
were 
doc tor s, lawyers , profes sors , different. So I think  they would have known the way of the wor ld a little bit 
m or e than m y par ents. So I don't really know about it. But I c an't im agine what it was  like. I mean, they 
s ent four c hildren away. They s ent Herm an a little later.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But not as part of the Kindertr ans por t.We'll he
ar
 
about that s hor tly.
 
 
So s om ehow or another you ar rive s afely in London in J une, 1939, as your  s is ter s had s everal 
m onths ear lier. So onc e you wer e in London, what do you know about what happened then, what 
happened when you ar rived, to the extent you know?  I think  you had an aunt in London. Tell us about 
her . And then you found your  way to the Harris ons .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I had an Aunt Hannah who lived in 
Londond
. 
She had emigrated to London in 
1933. As we know about imm igr ants her e, the only job s he c ould really get was  as  a dom estic  s o that's 

what s he did. But s he knew a lot of people that way. So s he arr anged places  for my s is ter s  to live.
 
 
My older s is ter, Bertl
e,
 
lived with a c ouple that went to Sc otland for  a while. So Ber tle was  in 
Sc otland for  a bit. And after Ber tle c am e back  to London, the polic e c am e to s ee her one day. They 

s aid, "Do you know" and they gave her s om e odd nam e. She s aid
, ﬁ
I don't know them .
ﬂ  
It tur ned out it 
was  the foster father. He had been a s py for the Germ ans keeping track  of the planes in Sc otland.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So this is  great. He's s pying for the Ger mans , taking c ar e of a J ewis h refugee as your  
c over .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Edith went to live with a family in London. And then when they s ent all the children 
out of London
 
--
 
bec aus e they did in England. They s ent the kids out of London. She went to live with a 
J ewis h fam ily in the c ountry. She c ouldn't go to s chool after  s he was  14. She always  s aid they treated 

her  like a s er vant or a s lave. But m y aunt

s he firs t went, lived with a doc tor 's family in London. Then at s ome point she went to live with another 
family that I know nothing about. And after that she went to a hostile.
 
One of the s tor ies  I heard was  
tha
t she went to the hos tile bec aus e s he wouldn't s tudy her Hebr ew les s ons . I don't think  that's  why s he 
went to the hostile. But she went to a hostile. And I think by the tim e we left, s he just about finis hed 
s c hool and was  doing s om e working.
 
> > B ill Bens on
:  Tell us what a hos tile was .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  It was  a plac e for c hildr en. Ac tually, a lot of the people in the Kinder tr ans por t 

landed up living in hos tiles .
 
And s om e of thes e hos tiles  s tarted out as s um m er  c amps, s o they didn't 
have heating. But they took  c are of it. They developed a fr iends hip, a kinship with thes e other kids  they 

were with. But that was  my thr ee s is ters.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you talk about the Har ris ons , I'm going
 
to

question about Edith.
 
 
As  you
 
m entioned, I think  s he was  in what s he per c eived to be an unhappy exper ienc e. She's  
older . She joins the Br itish's  women's auxiliar y in the Br itis h Arm y. After the war, tell us about her  

experienc e. Didn't s he have an inter esting exper ienc e in Germ any after the war ?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  She was  in Germany. She went to Adels heim, bas ic ally to get our birth c ertificates . 
She was  walking down the s tr eet in Adels heim and s omebody looked at her and s aid

m y German's

c er tific ates  for us.
 
 
I don't know

at that point

Bill Bens on:  So you end up in a ver y differ ent s et of c irc um stanc es than your s is ter s . You end up in 
this  little village with this  fam ily c alled the Har r is ons .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I did.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  And live
d 
ther e for a long tim e. Tell us  about your  life with the Harr is ons.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Fir st of all, ther e was  a Quak er  lady, Mr s .
 
Edm unds on
,  
who took  m e fr om London 
to Nor wic h
, o
ut in the c ountry fr om Nor wic h, the subur b of Norwic h. She had s ent a letter to my foster 
family s aying
 w
ill you be able to m eet us or do you want m e to br ing her out.
  
I don't know what they 
did. But that's how I got to Norwic h.
 
 
Well,
 
the way I got to the Har ris ons,
 
Unc le Har r y worked for a s hoe fac tory
 
an
d the man who 
owned the s hoe fac tor y was  J ewis h and had a s ign
-
up on the bulletin board is anybody willing to take a 
c hild.
  
So they did tak e a c hild. They took  m e. They had wanted a boy becaus e they had one s on but 
that didn't pan out s o they got m e.
 
 
The Har ris ons wer e very  fundamentalis t Chris tia
ns . They belonged t
o a c hapel, C
hur c h of 
England. I lived with them  for eight year s.When I firs t got there, I had s c arlet fever , s o I was  c onfined to 

m y room. Allen us ed to play with m e thr ough the window. I was  petrified of Unc le Harr y. He was  a very 

s oft
-
s poken, quiet m an
, never  rais ed his  voic e but I was  petr ified. The only thing that I can think  of is  I 
hear d men in Germ any yelling and that was  it.
 
I lived ther e for eight year s. I went to s c hool. I loved it 
ther e. I was  spoiled r otten. I don't know how Allen didn't tr y to kill me bec aus e they really, really did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You went to s c hool in the loc al public  s c hool?
 

> > Esther  Star obin:  In England they have the 11
-
plus  exam . I was  jus t ready to tak e that when I c am e 
her e.
 

7 
 
 
They belonged, as  I s aid to this  c hapel.
 
The m an who owned the c hapel, Mr.
 
Ram s ey, and I 
believe he helped them when I fir st c ame.When you were 2 at that point, you were s till a baby, s o he 
helped them. I think they oc c as ionally gave them s om e m oney, too.
 
 
At s om e point, Blooms bury Hous e, the organization in England that was  s uppos ed to be 
keeping tr ack of all of the
 
Kindertrans port people, s aid I needed to learn s om e Hebrew. And 
Mr .
 
Ram s ey knew Hebrew. He tr ied to teac h m e. But I'm ver y bad at languages.
 
 
And one other tim e Bloom s bury Hous e s ent somebody to interview m e. I r em em ber I was  at 
s c hool and the headmaster did not leave m e alone with the per s on. But other  than that, I don't 
r em em ber getting any s uper vis ion from Blooms bury Hous e.
 
 
My s is ter s  wer e all in
 
different plac es . And Hannah kept
 
tr ack  of us . And then when Bertle got 
old enough, s he kept trac k  of us.
 
After the war , they didn't really tr avel dur ing the war, but after the war 
they us ed to c om e to Norwic h and vis it. Allen, m y foster brother, and Ruth, wer e exac tly the s am e age. 

It wa
s  very nic e to have them  ther e.
 
 
I don't know that I thought it was  unus ual to have thes e s is ters  who lived other  plac es. I don't 
r em em ber thinking about it. I c ertainly didn't know any other people fr om the Kinder tr ans port when I 
was  in Nor wic h. But I've s inc e lear ned ther e wer e 200 people in that ar ea fr om the Kinder tr ans port. But 
the Harr is ons  not being Jewis h weren't plugged into that.
 
 
At s om e point ther e was  a m an who was  pr es ident of the Kindertrans por t as s oc iation here 
and he had been from Norwic h. He mentioned who his  fos ter fam ily had been. Allen looked them up 
and we went to vis it her. She didn't live very far away.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had no idea.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  And they als o had a ver y c los e r elations hip.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Harr is ons , it was  a ver y s imple life with them.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Mm
-
hmm . As  I s aid, they were ver y r eligious . No m ovies , no drink, no m akeup. 
And I never heard the r adio but I think that's bec aus e I was  s c ared of it.
 
 
When I got older, I'm not s o s ure it was  a r eligious thing with s om e of thes e things  they didn't 
do
. I
t c ould have been a money thing. I think  they didn't r eally have muc h. I went back one tim e and 
they wer e drinking c ider . And c ider in England is  alc oholic . And I thought, what!  So I think it was  as  

m uc h money as  anything els e.
 
They had c hickens. They gr ew vegetables, all of thos e kinds of things . 
So I had a ver y happy tim e. I was  very happy there.
 
We had gas masks. Went to s c hool.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The gas m ask  m akes me want to ask a little bit about if you have any rec omm endation 
of the impac t of the war . Bec aus e, of cour s e, when you got to the Harr is ons  was  right befor e World War 
II broke out in September
 
1939. Ther e was  the Battle of Br itain. Things were r eally rough in England. 
All the way through the end of the war . Do you have any rec ollec tion of the impact of the war on life for 
the Harr is ons  or  in the comm unity that you were liv ing in? 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  As I said, they lived out in the s ubur bs. Unc le Har ry rode a bike to 
w
or k  in the 
m or ning,
 
r ode back  at lunc htim e to eat lunc h, and r ode back. A lot of the people who lived ar ound us  
belonged to the s am e c hapel. It was  a very c ommunity
-
or iented
 
--
 
I m ean, now it's  ver y in for c hurches  
and s ynagogues to do a lot to build c omm unity but they did i
t then. They had ac tivities  and tr ips .
 
The union that Unc le Harry wor ked for had trips to the s eas ide. So there wer e a lot of s ort of
 
--
 
I 
as s ume that was  after the war. I'm not exac tly s ure.
 
 
I never felt that we wer e needy. But auntie was a good m anager.
 
She knew how to get 
whatever  s he needed for food. And as  I s aid, we had c hickens  in the back  for  a while s o they br ought 

r ats and we didn't have them anymor e. They gr ew vegetables . Ther e was  a big gar den. Ther e was  als o 
a shelter, a bom b s helter, that we went in.
 
 
They had a pretty small hous e. They didn't do things that c ost a lot of m oney. Sc hool in 
England at that tim e you wore unifor ms so you didn't have to buy a lot of c lothes .
 
Allen, who was  very 
br ight, had a s c holars hip to the loc al boys  s c hool. He
 
went to the boys  s c hool.
 
 
I was n't a ver y ques tioning pers on. I lived with them for eight years. I didn't think about the fact 
that I wasn't going to be ther e for ever. I didn't ask . I didn't question. I don't think kids questioned as 

m uc h in thos e days .

, s tate they lived in, were

ther  Star obin: Work  c am ps . My father's leg s omehow didn't go with him . He had a wooden leg. 
We have s om e letter s wher e they found him  another leg. I guess he needed the leg to work .
 
I think  they worked in the kitc hen. And s om e of the s tuff I've learned ab
out 
Her man 
I've lear ned 
r ec ently.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Herm an, your brother.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  My br other. For in
s tanc e, there were c am ps  that OSE and differ ent gr oups  took 

the c hildren and took them  to sc hools . I was  s aying to s om eone, when Her m an c am e, he
 
knew how to 
r ead, s uppos edly, Fr ench and Germ an. He didn't go to s c hool in Adels heim
. Wher e 
did 
he 
learn it?  
Apparently there were s chools  in thes e plac es .
 
 
So what's  been very interesting s inc e I've been volunteering, we found out a few things  about 
Her
m an, whic h are really  c ool things, I m ean
,  
to find out. Here it is  60, 70 year s  later and we'r e learning 
what happened.
 
 
The first thing we found out, s omebody found a pic ture of him  when he fir st landed in New 
York. And s om eone talking to him  a student fr om Colum bia, talking to him . And it's  s om ething we had 

never s een. Kar la tr ied to find the m an who had been talking to him but the m an had just died that year.
 
 
Then a c ouple of weeks  ago I was  here. They are going to have an exhibit about the Am er ic an 
r
es pons e. And Ron found a pic tur e of Herm an waiting to get on the s hip to c ome to this  c ountry. And 
the r eas on they c an tell it's  Herm an is  bec aus e he had a tag on and there's a lis t of who that was .
 
Now, Ron said to m e, "Do you rec ognize your  br other ?"  I looked at him and s aid, "I was  2 when I left. I 

don't know what he look ed like when he was  that old." But Karla s ays  it looks jus t like her dad.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This pic ture has jus t c om e to your attention.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  J us t rec ently. It's funny t o think  after all of thes e years  finding out things  about your 

s iblings  and your father.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did Her man get to the United States ?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  The United States in 1941 allowed 1,000 c hildr en in.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had been gone for two year s  alr eady.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah. Yeah. So Her man c ame then. Part of this  stuff, we found out, he c ouldn't 

quite r emem ber. Did he have s is ter s  her e?  They wer en't s ur e where to s end him. But my unc les k new 
he was  c om ing, s o they finally got
 
him hooked up

this  was  e

not e

m ail, letter s  back and

> > [Laughter]
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  About getting him s ent. And Her man c ame and he liv ed with an aunt and unc le 
her e. My aunt told Bertle when we c am e that Herm an used to hide food all over the hous e bec ause he 
was  hungr y, and do things like that. 
 
 
He always  c alled my aunt and unc le m om and dad, whic h didn't make Bertle happy. But I 
don't think his  kids  wer e r eally awar e that they wer en't r eally his  par ents until this  blabbermouth he
re 
told them . But they would have found
 
--
 
it bec ame
 
--
 
it would have become obvious  as  they got older. 
But he lived with them until he got m arr ied. I don't think  he ever lived anyplac e els e.

her e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  par ents ?

August
 
14, 1942 and, of c ours e, were murder ed as  
s oon as  they got ther e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin: 
 
You've s een 
doc um entation of that. Right?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah. Bertle always  knew. When I firs t c am e here I us ed to think , oh, m y parents  
will s how up. But Bertle had known: But this  was  another example of not talking about things then.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you ac tually know whic h c onvoy they wer e on, whic h train they wer e on that sent 

them to Aus c hwitz and they wer e m u
r der ed right away, onc e they got there.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Mm
-
hmm . Yeah. Ther e's  a Fr enc h book  that lis ts  all the c onvoys  from Franc e to 
Aus c hwitz. It was  the nam e, the num ber, the birth dates. That's  how we k now. But Bertle
 
--
 
I'm not 
exac tly sure how Ber tle k new bec aus e that book  wasn't out ther e but m aybe the lis t was  out that she 
did know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned a few m inutes ago s om e letter s that you had. Thes e were letter s that 

your  parents had written to the girls in England. I don't think 
you knew about their exis tenc e until fair ly 
late. Tell us a little bit about thos e letters . This  is  very poignant.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Ther e ar e five letters. In the 1980s , when ther e started to be a lot on televis ion, 
Bertle s aid, "Oh, I've got letters."
 
Well, they were tr ans lated. And that's basic ally all I know about my 
m other . And to say my par ents wrote the letters  is n't r eally tr ue. My m other wrote the letter s . My father  

wr ote one line under neath.
 
 
But m y m other s aid the sam e things  all of us would say to our kids : Do good, be well in 
s c hool, c lean behind your  ear s , thank  the people taking c ar e of you and that kind of thing. But s he als o 

would s ay to Bertle, s a
ve your c lothes for me
, 
I don't weigh m uc h now
; 
I'll
 
be able to wear your  c lothes  
or  
ask  this unc le or  s omething to s end m oney. I never  knew until I r ead thos e letters they needed 
m oney in the c amps . I didn't know that.
 
 
So Bertle talks  about the fact that when s he was old enough and working
 
--
 
that's how s he 
knew. She was  s ending money. And then
 
s he got som ething back . That's  how s he knew they had been 
killed.
 
 
At the beginning m y m other  wr ote about how s he was  going to see us again and s he 
expec ted to s ee us again and all of that.
 
But by the las t letter s he 
no longer believed that. And the 
lette
r s at the beginning, they had periods  and things, they were s ens ibly wr itten. By the end it was n't 
like that. You c ould tell that things wer e c hanging. I 
m ean, m y father wr ote bas ic ally
 
be good, your 
lov ing father  or  whatever. He didn't r eally write. But it was  inter esting to r ead the letter s. Bertle s aid 
ther e wer e originally m ore letters  but they had gotten los t.
 
 
Now, my fos ter  mother  als o kept a pos tc ard and a letter, one letter exc hanged between the 
Har r is ons  and Auntie Dot. So m y m other knew wher e I was . They had exc hanged let
ters. It's  a lovely 
quote like Esther 
is  a very
 
--
 
s he's very s weet, blah, blah, blah.
 
 
I thought it was  r eally s pec ial that m y fos ter  mother  s aved them for me. And als o, s he had 
s aved the s hoes that I was  wear ing when I c ame. I 
gave them to the mus eum  but I had the s hoes. You 
c ould s ee they were little booty things, boot things. And Unc le Har ry had fixed them  s everal tim es. But it 
was  very nic e to have that.
 
I als o had a dr es s that an aunt embroidered that they had s aved. I'm not
 
s ur e I would have known to s ave thos e things. I don't know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you happen to know the date, r oughly, of the las t letter you have? 
 

> > Esther  Star obin:  It was  1942. They wer en't dated. I tried to put them in or der . I'm not r eally s ure.
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  But s ome
 
tim e r elative c los e to befor e they were deported to Aus c hwitz.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Yeah. She did talk  about Herm an going off to wher ever he went off to. And at 

s om e point there was  an aunt in the kitc hen who m anaged to have a littl
e extra food for  Herm an.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se the war  ended in Eur ope in May
 
1945. It would be two year s  later, 1947, 
when your  s is ter, Bertle, ar ranged for you and your  s isters, inc luding Bertle, to c ome to the United 

10
 
 
States. Tell us about the dec ision to c om e her e, to leave wherever  you were eac h living, you with the 
Har r is ons  in England, to gather you together and move to the United States  in 1947.
 
> > Esther  Star obin: Well, my mother had always  told Bertle s he had to keep us  together. And as  Ber tl
e 

is  getting older, one of her  big joys  in life is we had this  big fam ily, 10 c ousins . But Bertle
 
--
 
we always  
had vis as
 
to 
c ome to this c ountr y, actually. Ruth cam e a week before we did. They got 
p
as s age on the 
boat. Bloom s bury Hous e arranged and paid part of it. And then we got pas s age for  Bertle and for me. 
 
 
B er tle
 
--
 
the Harr is ons didn't have a phone. So Bertle c alled the polic e station and had them 
c om e to the Har r isons and tell them they had to take m e to London the next day bec aus e we were 

leav ing. 
So they did. Allen was  suppos ed to get som e big pr ize at sc hool but he didn't go. And Unc le 
Har r y c ouldn't c om e. He c ouldn't take off work. So Auntie Dot and Allen took  me to
 
London and handed 
m e over  to Bertle. Here I am a pack age again.
 
Allen tells  me his m other's  hair  turned gr ay over night.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had been
 
with
 
them  eight year s.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  They knew I was  always  going to leave. I'm s ur e they did. But I c ertainly didn't 

want to c ome her e. I was with m y s is ter who I had m et but I didn't r eally know. I c er tainly didn't k now 
anybody here. So we c am e over  on the Queen Mary, whic h was n't a luxur y liner in
 
thos e days . I was  
terr ibly s eas ick. But the ship was  on s tr ike, the people wer e on s tr ike. I've lear ned s inc e then that 

s om ebody on th
e royal fam ily was onboar d s o it was  a good time to str ike. Luckily Ber tle had a 
boyfr iend who had given her  s aus age to br ing. My  aunt had given her br ead. So we didn't star ve. I was 

terr ibly s eas ick. Bertle didn't r eally want to go but that's  what m y m other s aid.
 
 
Edy had to stay behind bec aus e s he had another year  in the Ar my s o s he c am e a year  later .
 
 
So we c am e to New York . And two unc les  met us, Unc le Sally, who was  with Herman
 
--
 
no. I 
think  it was  Unc le Sally, who Ber tle rem em ber ed bec aus e he had lived in Adels heim . And an unc le who 

m arried. And we c am e down to Was hington.
 
 
Well, when you hear  stories  of people on the Kinder trans port, they talk  about how awful their 
experienc e in England was .What I talk about was  how awful m y exper ienc e was  liv ing with my unc le. 

My aunt was  quite c razy. And nowadays  there's m edic ine for  that but there was n't then. She would 
wake us  up and take the s heets  off at 5:00
 
in the mor ning. I took  lunc h every day. And I threw it away 
ever y day bec aus e the food was  bad.
 
 
The Ha
r ris ons never yelled. They had other ways of making you behave but yelling was n't it. 
My unc le yelled, thr ew fur nitur e. It was  not a good plac e to be living.
 
It was  a big hous e on Nor th 
Capital Street. There was  another r efugee family, m y aunt, unc le, aunt's  mother, two cous ins  and us . 
There were a lot of people in that hous e.
 
 
So I had never been to a m ovie. I didn't k now any thing about Judaism . I went to a s c hool 
wher e the teac her m ade fun of m y Englis h. I mean, m y Englis h was  Englis h.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on:  Bec ause you wer e s peaking pr oper Englis h by this  tim e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  And it was  a lot of stuff I alr eady knew. The only thing I didn't know was  
diagr am ming.Well, that was  in junior high and I still don't see the point of diagram ming.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  It was  a bad experienc e. The other thing is  I had a laz y eye and I had never had a 

patc h on my eye. I wor e glas s es. But they dec ided I should have a patc h. Her e I was  weir d, a refugee, 
and I had to go to s c hool with a patc h on m y eye. Well, of c ours e I took  it off as  s oon as I left the hous e 
and of c our s e I then found out they knew at s c hool I was  s uppos ed to be wearing it. But it was  a pretty 
bad exper ience living in that hous e.
 
At s ome point my unc le took me kicking and s cr eam ing to see a 
m ovie. We went onc e to s ynagogue on the high holidays . The s er vic e was in Hebrew and Germ an, 
neither of whic h I knew. It was  not a good exper ience.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At some point you would end up liv ing with your  s is ters . Right? 
 
>> 
Esther  Starobin:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They kept you under their wing.
 

11
 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Right. Onc e Edith c am e and they both had jobs, they got an apar tment. And here 
they wer e young people trying to m ake a living in a new c ountr y. They c ould have said to my unc les it's 
your  pr oblem but they took  m e in. So s om etim es  they were dating the teac her s  I had.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  But anyhow. The thing of it was , having gone to sc hool in England, I was  ahead 
her e. It never oc c urr ed to m e that I c ouldn't go to c ollege.What was  I thinking?  And did m y s is ters ever 

s ay you c an't go to c ollege?  No.
 
 
So my s is ter  Ruth was  mar r ied by then and living in Illinois
.  
I lived with them  and I went to 
c ollege. They bec am e my guar dian. I hadn't had a guardian before but he bec am e my guar dian. So I 
got in
-
state tuition. Bertle and Edith would s end us  c lothes s om etim es . He got a tiny amount of m oney 
fr om  Germany, like
 
$20 a month. My s is ter  Bertle told ever ybody they had to put it towar ds  my c ollege, 
whic h did
n't go over too well with Ruth and David but that's the way it worked. So I went to c ollege. 
 
 
And now I look back  on that and I think  it's abs olutely am azing, abs olutely am azing and Ruth 
had gone to c ollege, too. She had gone to Maryland. She had worked in the dining hall, whic h in those 

days  paid for her room, boar d, tuition. But s he was  really good in college. She got good gr ades .
 
So I think my parents  would be abs olutely as tounded. It's  a whole different thing.
 
 
My las t year  in high s c hool Her man joined
 
the Army. I don't think he was  dr afted. I don't know 
if he was  dr aft order  he joined. I don't r emember . But he didn't like to go too far from  hom e. He was  
hom es ick. He was  in the Arm y.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We end the pr ogram  in a little bit. Ther e's  a c ouple things  more I want you to talk about 

if you would. One of them , of c ours e, is  your  ongoing relations hip with the Har ris on family, after you left 
and had c ome to the United States. Tell us a little bit about that. 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  As I s aid, my s is ter s
 
were very wis e. They m ade m e wr ite letter s and k eep in 
c ontac t. Allen c ame over  as  a Fulbr ight teac her  in 1954, I think . Maybe befor e that. Anyhow, he c ame 

over . We took  our kids and went to England.We had gone befor e that. And then while Allen was  her e,
 
we br ought his  par ents  over. Here are thes e people who didn't have a phone, didn't have a r efrigerator 

until we went and bought one whic h they turned off when we weren't ther e.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  They got on the air plane and c am e to this country. So they s pent, I don't know, 

m aybe three weeks with us . Allen was  teac hing in New J er s ey. I s aid find a beac h plac e we c an all 
go 
to. He found this  plac e in Toms River, whic h is  not where you go to the beac h. They 
had 
ins ec ts all 
over , mosquitoes . But they c ame and s pent time with us . We us ed to take the kids .
 
 
Allen was  always  Allen. He was  never Unc le Allen. Auntie Dot and Unc le Harr y wer e in a way 
grandpar ents  but they knew they wer en't the r eal grandpar ents . We went several times . Debor ah and 

Ju
dy went one tim e.
 
 
When I finally went back to Adels heim, c om ing bac k  ever ybody
 
--
 
by then Aunt Dot was  dead. 
Unc le Har ry s aid don't c ome all at one time, it's too c onfus ing. But J udy had been back . So part of our 
fam ily. I jus t was  ther e November  of las t 
year.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All of thes e years  later . How about your  s ister s ?  Did your s is ter s  have any c onnection 
with anybody with whom they had lived?
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Edy had her  best friend where s he lived who turned out to be a wor ld fam ous 

m odel. So
 
s he had a little c ontact with Avril. She was  this  gorgeous blond. I don't know if s he was  
blond. Gorgeous m odel. Ther e us ed to be an ic e c r eam plac e inWas hington that had this fanc y ic e 

c r eam. She jus t ate the whole thing.Who expec t
s 
a model to?
 
> > [Lau
ghter] 
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  But other than that, Ruth had s om e c ontac t with the Nic hols. And their s on c ame 

her e to work s o Ruth
 
had
 
a little bit of c ontact. Ber tle didn't have c ontact with anybody, I don't think , that 
s he had been as s ociated. She went back to England onc e. She m ight have met the guy that had been 

her  boyfriend. I don't r emember.

> > Bill Bens on:  The other  question I wanted to as k  or have you talk about is , you had m entioned 
Reinhart. You have been back to Adels heim a c ouple of times now,
 
I 
think
. Tell us what it was  like to go 
bac k  ther e
, 
what that experienc e has been like for  you and how important Reinhar t has been.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  I think  in 1985, 1986, I needed to s ee that I didn't c ome fr om  a black hole.We 
were going to go with 
m y s is ter Bertle and her husband but he had a heart attack  s o they c ouldn't go. 
So we went bac k , Fr ed and I. Bertle had wr itten a letter to them in German bec aus e I c ouldn't. We got 
ther e. The whole town was  dead. It was  s o s tr ange. But we finally found the Town Hall. And we m et 
s om eone ther e but nobody s poke Englis h. But the as s is tant
 
--
 
the deputy mayor's  wife s poke Englis h 
s o we arr anged to m eet with them  the next day and go ar ound Adels heim. And they s aid, well, you 

don't want to s tay in Adels heim  tonight. I s aid, yeah, I do; I'm not being s ent away again. So we s tayed 
in the guest hous e. And I had s uc h nightm ar es  that night. I dream t the Nazis  were c om ing up the stair s  

to get m e. It was  very s car y. But we ate in the little restaur ant ther e. I'm s ure the
 
people k new who we 
were. We had no idea what we were eating, probably things  we didn't want to eat. So we went that 

tim e.
 
 
Then in 19
 
--
 
60 year s later , 40
 
--
 
2000. In the meantim e, Bertle had been bac k . And the m an 
who originally knew all about the J ews  and k new about m y father was  no longer  doing it. He pas s ed 
this  on to Reinhar t to do. And Reinhart was  the teac her in the sc hool. He had
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In Adelsheim .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  In Adels heim. He had kids in s ort of an after s c hool c lub. They did r es ear c h on the 

J ews  and Ber tle became pretty friendly with Reinhart. And he c am e to vis it. I was  determ ined I wasn't 
going to like Reinhart but he's a lovely man and his  wife is very nic e. So they c ame to vis it her e.When 
we went back in 2000, we s tayed with them. And Kar la's  s ister went with us .
 
 
In the m eantim e, we had m et s om eone fr om the city wher e m y m other was  fr om s o we went 
ther e fir st and vis ited. Then we went to Adels heim. There was  a c eremony c om m em orating the 

deportation. It was  a very inte
r es ting c er em ony
, all in German.
 
I didn't unders tand a wor d but I c ould 
get the feeling for  it.
 
 
So Reinhart ar ranged exhibits  of the five Jewis h fam ilies . There were Xerox c opies . You 
know, he didn't have m oney to do this .
 
> > Bill B ens on:  This is  
som ething he had c hos en to do.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Chosen to do. His  father was  a Nazi. His  m other is  worr ied that he's s o involved 
with the J ewis h that it will dr ive him c razy. But now he has  gr andc hildr en so he's not quite s o involv ed. 
They read s om e of
 
m y par ents' letters . They told what happened to people. Bertle tried to give a 
s peec h but s he c ouldn't do it. They did s ome J ewis h mus ic .
 
It r eally was  a ver y interes ting c eremony. 
 
 
While we wer e there, we met a c ouple of people that Bertle had known as  a c hild. And 
s om ebody s aid, oh, they us ed to leave food on the doorstep for my parents  at night. And I s aid to 
Bertle, "Do you think  that really happened?"  She s aid s he remem bered our mother  writing about it. And 
that was  pretty brave bec aus e if they had been found out by the Nazis , their fam ily would have been 
not doing well.
 
And s omebody els e s aid that their parents  us ed to s wap
 
--
 
m y parents  had items  they 
wanted. They would s wap things  for them.
 
 
While we wer e there, Reinhart found a lis t. The Nazis  m ade a lis t of everything in my par ents ' 
hous e when we were depor ted. It's  pages  and pages of s tuff
. I
t even says  the rags  that were in the 
hous e. But
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Doc um ented ever y s ingle thing in the hous e.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Everything was  doc umented. Ber tle looked at it. She said we had a really fanc y 

doll that we wer en't allowed to play with in the living r oom. That was n't on there s o s om ebody lifted that 

alr eady.
 
So it was ver y inter esting to s ee. The other thing
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To s ee a list of all of your  families ' belongings .
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Right. I don't r em em ber  it. We als o went to the J ewis h c emeter y, whic h is  between 
that and another town. It's  well kept. Reinhart tak es  c are of it. So that's pretty well taken c are of.

Tam ar a 
an
d her fam ily have been back. Renee and her s is ters  have been back. Stac ey and I 
went bac k  when Stac ey was  ther e for bus ines s . So I've been back  thr ee tim es  actually. It s till doesn't 
s eem like hom e though. But now there's a little monum ent to the J ews  that
 
lived ther e.
 
 
So Reinhart's  s on was  here. I was pr etty good fr iends  with him . When I went to m eet Stac ey, I 
went to Berlin and s pent s om e tim e with them. So I think I've made peac e with the Germ ans  bec aus e 
not all Germ ans  wer e Nazis  and I have to r ealize that. [Whis pering inaudible]
 
> > Bill Bens on: We have a c ouple of minutes . We'r e going to tur n back to Es ther  to c los e the pr ogram. 
It's  our  tr adition that our Fir s t Per s on has  the last wor d. So Esther will hav e the las t word. But before 
that we'd like to s ee if you have any questions . I'd like you s tay s eated through the ques tions that we do 
have s o when you hear  Es ther's  c los e r emark s .
 
 
We will have tim e for a couple of ques tions . We have m ic rophones  on either s ide of the ais le. 
Wait until you have a microphone if you have a question. Tr y to make it br ief. I'll repeat it s o that 

ever ybody hear s  it, do the bes t I c an.
 
 
Do we have anybody that would like to pos e a ques tion here to Esther?  We have a young 
m an here in the m iddle. The m ic will c om e down to you
. 
 
Thanks, Tam ara.

m y family than I know about him, about m y fam ily. He has gone back . He k nows  this  r

r elative. That's  wher e we've gotten bas ic ally our fam ily tr ee.
 
But I got even with him .When his kid was  
living her e, I knew m ore about his  kid than he did.

and then we're going to wr ap 
up.
 
> >What was  your  firs t [Inaudible]
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  your  fir s t thought when you enter ed the town y ou were born, when you went 

bac k
?   
 
Thank  you.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  How s tr ange it was . Why was  nobody there?  And
 
I certainly
 
--
 
I felt like a vis itor . I 
didn't feel like it was m y hom etown in any way.
 
 
One other thing I want to s ay. I've made you laugh a couple of times . I often think of all the 
things mis s ing in my family, not knowing my par ents . And this  sounds s illy .What do I know about how 
we c elebr ated holidays ?  What do I know about our m edic al his tor y?  What do I know about their 
grandpar ents ?  I don't k now any of thos e things . I mean, I was  ver y luc ky. I was  s aved. I've had a good 
life. But ther e are lots  of
 
things  that are m is s ing. And I don't want you to think  it's all funny. It is n't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, plus , very few of your extended fam ily s urvived.
 
> > Esther  Star obin:  Oh, no. Not at all.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . I'm going to tur n back  to Es ther to c los e
 
our pr ogr am.When s he finis hes her las t 
word to c los e our  progr am, our photogr apher, J oel, will c om e up on the s tage and take a photogr aph of 

Es ther. And I'm going to as k  you
 
to
 
s tand at that point s o that you ar e standing for the back ground on 
the photo. And then when Es ther  is  done, we're going to try to get her  off the s tage bec aus e s he's  

going up to the top to s ign c opies  of "Ec hoes  of Mem or y." That will be an oppor tunity then if you want to 
as k  her another ques tion or just have your  pictur e taken with her or  s ay hi to her.
 

 
On that note, Es ther ?

And I am her e bec aus e individual people s tepped out of their c omfort
