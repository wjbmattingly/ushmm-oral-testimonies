JAY M. IPSON 
December 2, 1995 
 
A: My name  is Jay Ipson, it was Yakov Ipp in Eu
rope and now that I reflect on it, I'm really 
sorry that it was ever changed, because as I 
am trying to recapture for my  grandchildren 
my roots, a change of name  is like a change 
of address. I feel very uncomfortable about 
it. One of the reasons that we came about the 
change is because of the anti-Semitism that 
we felt when we came with the name  of Ipp, it was felt by the rest of my fa mily, which 

were already in America, that it mi ght dr
aw attention, as though our accent didn't, you 
know so that you had to change your name  to be
 Americanized, change it to an American 
name . We made a change, but I was born Yakov 
Ipp in Kovno, Lithuania. We  lived . . .  
Q: When were you born? 

A:  In 1935. June 5, 1935. We, as I remember 
it are what I would say a upper mi ddle class 
fa mily.  I didn't lack for anything. We lived, what you mi ght say in an order of 
description in a me dieval courtyard. The 
houses in Slobotka, which was a suburb of 
Kovno, were built in such a way that they a
fforded the inhabitants protection. They we re 
built in a semi -circle, like. We  had my gra
ndmother's house was facing the street, it was a 
two story house. On the first floor was a 
whiskey store operated by a Lithuanian woman. 
My grandmother lived upstairs with my grandf
ather and my two aunts, and then if you'r e 
looking from the backside of the courtyard on 
the right hand side, closing it out was our 
house, also two story, and upstairs we had 
a neighbor, downstairs I reme mber in our, 
what you mi ght say dining room or living room, 
we had a mo torcycle, because it also was 
a sales room to show off the motorcycles that
 my father and mother were selling, while 
my father was out drummi ng up bus iness in 
the country showing his mo torcycle, my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

mother was showing it on the inside. On the 
left hand side of that same  courtyard, was 
the shop where the motorcycles used to be 
fixed, and then we had a wooden, as you call a 
parkan?? , a wooden fence, with 
a gate that closed the whole 
establishment in. That's the 
way the houses were built it was more I guess 
of safety, so at ni
ght intruders couldn't 
come  in, it afforded us safety inside of our 
yard or courtyard. The yard was not as is 
customary here in the United States to be in
 the back, but in most
 cases, it was in the 
front, as you see in a English vi
llage on television quite frequently. This is how we lived.  
Q: Did you have a lot of family?  Did 
you have brothers and sisters?   
A: I had, not at this point that 
I described to you. I had a little 
sister that was born just prior 
to the war breaking out with Germa ny. This 
description that I'm giving you now is while 
we were still under Lithuanian occupa -- not occupation, we lived in Lithuania just as fr ee 
as anybody; at that point  I felt no anti-Semitism. 
We had a maid that used to take care of 

me  and fix my lunch and take care of my n
eeds, and we were very comfortabl e at that 
particular point. The next point 
that I really remember from th
is setting that I've described 
to you, is what happened just as, well the Ru
ssians came in first, and in fr ont of the 

house, that yard that we had was an open, squa
re area, more of a traffic circle, like you 
have here in Wa shington, the 
traffic circles, that you coul
d go around in order to go into 
Kaunas, you had to cross over, go through the circle, cross over the bridge and then you 

would head into Kaunas after crossing the 
water that was surrounding Slobotka area, and 
I reme mber that when the Soviets came in 
and the Russian soldiers used to have the 

Russian star on top of the caps, a couple of 
kids ma naged to, that 
I was playing with, had 
some , had gotten one, and I asked him, how did you get it, he said well I went over to the 

Russian soldier and I asked him for it. I sa
id, well you don't speak Russian, I said I don't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
3 
 
speak Russian, at this point I didn't, I spoke 
Lithuanian, and I spoke Yiddish, but I didn't  
speak Russian yet. He says, just go over a
nd tell him, [Russian spoken here], which 
means, hello friend, give me  a ma rking, or your
 emblem, and those were my first Russian 
words I learned. Subsequently I did learn Ru
ssian. The soldiers were right fond of the 
kids and kids were, well me  in particular
 was fond of the uniforms and the guns and I 
used to hang around, so I started picking up so
me  Russian, and it wasn't  very difficult for 
me  to pick it up. Shortly, shortly a period pass
ed by and after that pa
rticular period I was 
out in the street, and I was being strafed. Th
ey weren't particular strafing me, a plane 
came, it was a German a i rcraft, Russia and Germany had gone to war, and he strafed the 

street. Some body came by and pulled me  in and brought me  back into the house. I came 

into the house, and in those 
days we didn't have the modern conveniences that, when 
you're talking to children about radios, firs
t thing they think is
 of a boom box and a 
television. Our radios were powered by battery, 
they were as big as the Wurlitzer radio 
boxes that we had now, the record boxes used to 
be in the fifties and the sixties that were 
in all the rest aurant s, and they were powe
red by a battery. Wh en I came in I heard on the 
radio [Uvaga, uvaga, uvaga and that meant, a
ttention, attentio
n, attention in Russian. The 
Russians were told to re
port to their stations.  
 

Q: You know what, Jay, I don't want to -- I'm so
rry to stop you, but I just wanted to ask you 
a little bit more before the wa
r began. See if we can draw any other me mo ries of how you 
spent your time , of your playing, of your fa
mily or your grandparents ma ybe. What your 
fa mily's  religious observances, anything that
 you can reme mb er when you were a little 
boy?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

A: Right, my pl aying, I used to spend a w
hole lot of time in my -- my really young, two, 
three, four years, I can't  tell you much about. 
Wh en I got to about five or so I used to 
continuously run to my grandmother, my mo
ther's, my father's mother. I used to 
continuously spend time with her, for some  r
eason or other I felt more comfortable in her 
environment than where mother was being bus
y selling, trying to show the motorcycles 
and other things that she was 
pre-occupied, so I used to spend some  ti me  over there. As 

far as playing around, I don't re me mb er much, th
e one thing that stands
 out in my mi nd is 
Simc has Tora, which was of course the holid
ay where the Jewish people received the 
Torah, [actually end and beginning of the cycle of
 Tora reading] and in Europe that was a 
big to-do with flags and candles on the flag
s and the Star of David was ma de out of 
me tal, we didn't have all the safety precauti
ons that you have now, and I reme mber sitting 
at the dining room table, my father wassitting opposite me , and we were having some  
tea. We  had a neighbor, I think, some body from
 upstairs came down, and I had that flag, 
and of course the Star of David was ma de out of tin, and was really sharp, and for some 
reason, I don't know why, but I reme mber hitting 
daddy in the head with 
it, and the star of 
course put a big gash right 
there, and the neighbor said, 
now do it again and it'll close up 
the first gash. I reme mb er that. Other than that . . .  
 

Q: Do you come from a religious home, wa
s -- did you live in a 
Jewish community?   
 

A: We were very religious 
in those time s, I reme mb er going to the synagogue, and I 
reme mber in those days, everybody had their ow
n stendar[small reading desk], their own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
5 
 
little place, which was in front of
 where they used to sit, that 
they used to be able to keep 
their tallith and their 
prayer book, and my grandfather and my
 father used to be there, and 
I was too small to pay any a
ttention. My big thing was runni
ng between him, upstairs to 
mother, because in the European tradition, 
the women wer e separated fr om the men, it 
was not, it wa s a religious orthodox community, so
 the wome n sat in an upstairs cubicle, 
with just kind of pigeon holes, or little 
windows, opened, looking over the me n's portion, 
and all the me n were sitting downstairs, and 
I used to continuously run from downstairs 
to upstairs, fr om upstairs to downstairs. I neve
r was one to sit still in any one location for 
any length of time, and of course because of
 my age at that time, I didn't  understand 
much of the service and I didn't have a
ny education. My educ
ation started after 
concentration camp, I did not, at five years 
I was too young to haveany of it, and it was 
during that period of time.  
 
Q: But, any other me mories -- I'm trying to get 
a sense of what it was like living ther e before 
the war as much as, I know you were quite young, but as much as you can tell me . The 
feeling you got from it, or . . .  
 

A: There were no restrictions
, you did not feel any different
 than anybody else, everything, 
all the stores such as they were, everythi
ng was written in Yiddi
sh, you were living as 
though, you're living in a completely Jewish 
environment, even though you had Christian 
neighbors, and we had a Christian maid, but 
to me I didn't feel any different than 
anybody else. I didn't have any restrictions on me
 other than normal restrictions that a 
child has, not to run out in the street . Now one time, I did wander off with some little girl, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
6 
 
and then I told, chased her away, I didn't wa
nt her following me , and when I got back I 
got a beating for it from mother, mo ther wa
s the disciplinarian, da
ddy never raised a hand 
to me , and I was petrified of hi m. Only once, 
and if I reme mb er I'll tell you about it later, 
did he give me  a good s panking, and it was 
totally unjustified, but
 that's the only 
spanking he ever gave me , and that 's where so
me anti-Semitism did play a part in it. But 
other than that I wa
s totally, I had the run of the hous
e, I was a very spoiled kid. I 
reme mber that we had a round table, and I 
had a tricycle, and the only way my mother 
could get me  to eat is if I road the tricyc
le around and I would co
me  by her station, and 
she would give me some soup to fill up, but I 
wouldn't sit still any ot
her way. So I used to 
ma ke a circle, finish my spoon of soup, come
 bac k, she'd give me  another spoon of soup 
and I'd ma ke another circle and she always tr
ied to feed me with 
chicken soup, telling me  
how, and she was a fantastic storyteller. I re
me mber her telling me  
the stories, how good 
the chicken soup was, and that for every one of
 those little circles 
that you had in the 
chicken soup, it used to represent money. We
ll the fatter you ma de it, of course, the 
bigger the circle got and pretty
 soon it was one big circle 
and didn't represent much of 
anything, and she used to have other kind of st
ories to keep me  entertained, so I would be 
content. Toys, we didn't have ma ny toys in 
those days, it wasn't  -- everything that you 
had was either carved out of
 wood, my father brought me  
back a scooter, two wheels and 
a push, out of wood, and other than that, I 
don't recall ma ny toys. I do recall that my 
father had a big trophy case with
 all sorts of trophies, becaus
e of his sports motorcycle, 
he was a mo torcycle enthusiast, and he was 
a very good racer. He didn't -- the racing in 
Europe is unlike the racing he
re on motorcycles, you don't go around in a circle, it's cross 
country, and I think that's what involved him 
in the motorcycle business, because he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
7 
 
an exceptionally successful racer, and he ha
d a trophy case full, he didn't race for mone y, 
he raced for trophies. I reme mber that, and th
e othe r thing I reme mber is some  of the 
liqueur that my mother used to ma ke, she ma
de her own liqueur out of some  kind of fruits 
and stuff, and I reme mbe r  it was very sweet, and I used to try to get some  of it when we 
had dinner, because of the sugar cont ent it was, 
it wasn't  a harsh lique ur, it was more of a 
very sweet, she used to ma ke her own, and basi
cally that's prior to the war, about all I 

r e me mb e r .   
 

Q: Hanukkah?  Purim ?   

 

A: Hanukkah -- Purim to me, I was too 
young to really understand what was going on. 
Hanukkah, yes, we used to light the candles a
nd it was always a festive environment, but 
we continued the festive environment in the 
ghetto, and I reme mber it mo re of the ghetto 
than I do before the ghetto.  
 

A: Okay, let me -- you were telling me  that when the Germans came in, you were in the 
street and you were strafed?   
 

Q: That'scorrect. 

 

A: Now, was this scary, was it exciting?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

Q: To me  it was exciting, I was always fascinated
 with airplanes, I had no idea what strafing 
was. I saw this airplane, I heard the airp
lane noise, I looked up, I saw an airplane up 
there, and things flying out of the wings, re
d flashes and they didn'
t mean anything to me . 
Things were happening on the sides of me , I ha
d absolutely no idea what it was until I got 
pulled into the house, and at that time, I wasn
't  afraid of anything, it didn't me an anything 
to me . You'r e  young, you're fascinated with ai
rplanes, to me  it was big fun. So it had no 
impact on me, but when we got in and the ne
xt thing that I reme
mber after I told you 
about the radio, and the uvaga, uvaga, the 
attention, attention, my father had a 
motorcycle, and the Soviets sent out word, th
ey wanted him and the motorcycle to report 
to an assembly point, and my father was goi
ng to deliver that motorcycle to them, and 
mother said, no you're not, and she fainted, a
nd because she fainted and that's the first 
time I've ever experienced anything like that, 
one of his friends came by and he told him, 
he says, you always wanted to ride my mo torcycle, he says here are my gl oves, my 
helmet, my goggles, take my motorcycle and de
liver it to such and such assembly point, 
and the guy got to that assembly point with 
the motorcycle, and he was taken, a Russian 
officer got him, right on him, wouldn't let hi
m go, and took him off to the Soviet Union 
with the motorcycle, and they left. And the reas
on I know that is because after the war, he 
came back and told us what had happened to him. Had my fat her delivered the 
motorcycle, my father would have never co
me  back. So we were kind of lucky. After 
having delivered that mo torcycle, my  father felt 
that we needed to escape as well, so he 
went back and he was in charge of an artel, which is a co-operative, a transportation 

co-operative, so he went back to the co- 
operative and came back 
with a horse and buggy, 
and that's when my sister, at that time she 
was born, she was about 
three months old, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

he loaded us into the surrey, and took us on.The reason that, one of the reasons that we 
tried to escape with the Russians is, my
 parents home was always an open home. 

Anybody that ever looked for a place to bed 
down, or needed to come  by, or needed 
some thing, it was always there, and we had, or
 they had given refuge to a, and I don't 
reme mber his name, a gentleman that came 
from Lodz, from Poland, he was escaping 
what was happening in Poland, to the Jews, and wh
ile he was with us he told us what had 
happened to some  of the Jews in Poland, so 
my fa ther already knew that if the Germans 
came in, it would not be good for us, so he load
ed us up and we tried to escape with the 
Russians. That was in the summertime, and the 
reason that I reme mber that it was in the 
summertime  is one of the refugees, he was, ju
st hordes of people, I mean the roads in 
Lithuania weren't any good, they were dirt 
roads, and people with walking and pulling 
wagons and horses, it was just ma yhem, and 
one ma n started running around, he had lost 

his mi nd, and he started screaming to anybody, 
anybody that has a Soviet flag, tear it up 
and ma ke a scarf out of it and put it on your 
head, so when the Germans come  in, will not 
find the Russian flags on you. And he had one, 
he tore it up and he 
just kept running from 
person to wagon to wagon, wherever he could, 
says give me  your Russian flags, tear 
them up, ma ke scarves, hair scarves out
 of them. We were cut off by German 
paratroopers. The Soviets that were moving w
ith us, they took off to the woods, the 

refugees were cut off and told to turn b
ack. My father spoke extremely good German, he 
was very fluent in it, and when they stoppe
d him and questioned him, he told them he 
was a refugee with children and all that, a
nd because of his German, originally they 
thought he was a spy, but then he convinced th
em that he was just a plain refugee, and 
they turned around and sent hi
m, sent us back to Kovno.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

Q: Was there any craziness going on in the st
reets with Lithuanian people or German 
soldiers or anything like
 that that you saw?   
 

A: When we got back, we could not, our house 
that we had lived in, 
was already occupied 
by Lithuanians, because we had abandoned it, and the Lithuanian neighbors imme diately 

moved into the house. My grandparents on my 
mothers side, their house, they had never 
left, so they stayed in the house. We  t hen moved i n with them. Their house became the 

very edge house of the ghetto, so when the ghetto, when everybody was put in to the 

ghetto, we were already living in that house, 
because we couldn't move into our house, 
we couldn't chase the Lithuanians ou
t I mean, we 'd lost the house.  
 

A: You didn't see any rampages on the stre
ets _? ____, or that you were aware of?   
 
Q: I don't, I don't re me mbe r  it. It certainly 
was a lot going on, and to me  I didn't understand 
all the rami fications at that 
time  or what was going on.  
 

Q: What did your parents tell you was go
ing on?  Did they te
ll you anything?   
 

A: To be honest with you, I don't recall discussing 
it with them at that time, it just, blank. 
The next thing that I reme mber is my mother
's  parents, my grandparents on my mother's 
side, who's house we had moved into, it was ve
ry small, because of so many people lived 

in it, and in that house which was also builtin a si milar manner, the way I described my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
11 
 
other grandparents house, ex
cept that instead of the workshop where the motorcycles 
were, we had an outhouse. There was no insi
de plumbing in any of our houses. You got 
your water fr om a well that you cranked up and if you had to go to the bathroom during 
the day, you just went in an unheated cold
 outhouse, it was built out of wood, with a big 

hole, it had three or four hol
es, and that's where we went to the bathroom. I do reme mb er 
at one point that it had to be
 emptied and my uncl e , two uncles, and my gr andfather dug a 
pit in the yard and emptied the outhouse into 
that pit, put dirt b
ack on it and then they 
planted cucumbers, put cucumber seed on it,
 and they came up, well before they had a 
chance to really become  any si
ze at all, I raided the cucu
mbe r s and I ate them. It was 
cucumbers, and I still like them to this day, p
eas that grow in a shell, I forgot, you shell 
them, they used to grow that way, and I used 
to eat the shell and all while they were st ill 
on the vine. The other thing that, when the Ge
rmans came, we had to give up all that we 
had, and the way the house was built, it was my
 grandparents, it was also a two story 
house, the second story was an attic type of th
ing, and you had an access-way to the attic, 
like a long walkway, and my grandfather pu
lled up the boards on that walkway and hid 
some  things into that walkway and nailed them
 down. At a later time he took them back 
out and burne d them, because he was afraid 
if he got caught with them and too ma ny 
people found out about that walkway, if he got  caught, would have been killed, so instead 

of turning that stuff in, he 
burned it. Now I, whe n my father was in Berlin, on the way 

back from Berlin, he bought me  a beautif
ul fur coat. It was embroidered, it was a 
beautiful thing, and that had to be turned in, 
everything like that ha
d to be turned in. I 
reme mber parting with that coat, and then I also reme mber some body telling us they 

didn't realize it was my coat because they sa
w it go through the selection, if they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
12 
 
realized it they mi ght have ta
ken it and lifted it and brought it back to me , but it went. 
Also I reme mber in ghetto, I did have two thi
ngs happen to me  that 
were a little unusual. 
I was out in the street in the ghetto, and of 
course we lived right by the fence, it was a 
double barbed wire fence, and I was out st
anding by the fence, and a guard threw 
some thing at me . I thought he was throwing a 
big rock at me , and I ran. A few mi nutes 
later, a man came in the yard, asked me why 
I ran, I said, well he was going to hit me  
with a rock, I wasn't  going to stand there like 
a fool. He said, no, here it is, it's a piece of 
bread that he threw to you. So I guess there is
 some  good in some  people. Had he told me  
in Lithuanian what he was doing, I wouldn't 
have run, but I thought he was just going to 
-- because we could hear shooting all the time
 and I thought that he 
was just going to hit 
me with a boulder. And the othe
r thing that I reme mber is 
my father came  home wi th 
some  bread, and some  butter, my mother had 
fixed me  a slice of bread and I went, I put 
the slice of bread in the stre
et, and a kid from across the street came over to me  and says, 
look I've got this airplane, I'll swap you this 
airplane, from a couple of pieces of wood, he 
says, for this piece of bread, how about it? 
And I gave him my sa
ndwich and I got that 
airplane, and I caught a beating when I got in
 the house, after mother asked where'd I get 
a airplane, I said I traded m
y, it's mi ne, I traded my bread for it. So she gave me  a 
beating, why'd I trade away my bread, well I wa
sn't  as hungry as that kid was, and that 
airplane was going to last me  for a while, so 
I felt it was a good deal, and I had that as a 
toy. The other toy that I had, th
ere were a lot of captured 
Russian soldiers that were 
captured from the, imme diately as the paratr
oopers came in, and they had them at holding 
area, or lock-up. The Russian soldiers were sk
illed craftsme n and one of them had ma de a 
wooden revolver out of a piece of wood, and 
I had my uncle, who was at that time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
13 
 
ma rried to my father's  s i ster, he was in char
ge of that work area over there, and a Russian 
soldier gave him that, whatever deal they
 ma de, I don't know, and he bought. I had a very 
young nephew that was, he was just about a ye
ar old, and he couldn't use that gun so my 
uncle gave me  that gun to play with instea
d of his own son, who was too small to play 
with it. He perished, the son and my aunt pe
rished. Those were basi
cally the toys that I 
had, other than I had fr ee reign of the ghett
o, that area, I was extremely familiar with, 
between the small ghetto and the large ghett
o, where we had the bridge, there was a 
bridge that was connecting the two ghettos, a
nd an aunt of mine lived, actually it's my 
father's  aunt, lived right next 
to the br idge, so I used to 
go visiting her quite a bit. One 
instance, just as we, I was over there one 
day, you know wha t  a samovar is, it's a kettle 
where they make tea, I was over there play
ing one day and I pulled it over on me , and 
scalded myself, and her quick thinking got me
 s o I didn't get burned. I knew that area 
extremely well, I used to play in it, in fact 
before the ghetto, that cousin of mi ne, he wa s a 
daredevil motorcycle ride r, and I used to 
hang around there, because of the motorcycles, 
that's one of the drawing points. I wouldn'
t do any of the things that, around my house 
with a motorcycle, so one time I was over there, at that time I was six years old, it was 
just before going into the ghetto. Wh en they
 asked me  how to start up a motorcycle, we ll 
it's not like hitting the 
starter now, in those days you had to
 go through four or five steps 
to start a motorcycle, with the carburetor
 and all. I showed him how to start the 
motorcycle, they put me  on it, and I rode away
 with it. So I always, that was my favorite 
hang- out, I used to hang out over there, and 
that was the area at a later time that we 
escaped at.

Q: You had, it sounds like you had a lot of
 freedom, you were kind of running around the 
ghetto.  
 
A: Inside the ghetto I did. During the day, th
e Germans didn't  bother, I was too young to be 
in a work detail, and at that time  they ha
dn't cracked down on the ki
ds for execution, so I 
had the run of the ghetto, basi
cally I could go where I want
, I could do what I want.  
 

Q: Did you have pals, I mean you had, sounds like you had a good time.  

 

A: I had pals.  

 

Q: What did you play?  
Did you play war?   
 
A: No, that's some thing we didn't, we used to
 chase around, we used to play tag, we used to 
play hide and seek. I reme mber one time a frie
nd of mi ne said if you 
stroke this rainpipe 
a few times, a fly will come  out and do some  tr
icks, I didn't know any better, so I stroked 
it, I stood still and stroked it. I never saw th
e fly, he says, stupid, she flew away. But 
those are the kind of games we'd play, of course . . .  
 
Q: Did the older kids teach the younger kids di
fferent things like wher
e to hide or you know 
_? _____game , that kind. How did you learn ____? ___?   
 

A: Actually you learned street smarts. They didn't . . .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
15 
 
 
Q: How?  

 

A: By observation. You'd al ways, you learn so
me  nasty things, you learn nasty language, 
you grew up fast. You learned to stay away 
from dangerous areas, you sensed what was 
dangerous and you disappear. If you saw a Germ
an guard, you certainly weren't, I never 
reme mber ever going up to a German guard, 
say hey give me  your badge. That you knew, 

that was dangerous, you had a sense, you felt it. Then whenever you'd see a German, 

you'd try to get away as far as you could. You us
ed to see sad scenes 
out in the street, if 
you saw some body sitting on a doorstep cryi ng, you knew some thing happened to the 

fa mily. Many time I'd walk by and I'd see 
a woman sitting on the doorstep crying, a 
neighbor, and then you'd come  home  and ask what happened, and her husband or a 

brother or father was taken 
away, is gone, and she was sitting there mourning. That was a 
natural thing. I had a great-grandmother that 
I was very fond of, she 
used to take care of 
me , she died, she developed pneumonia, and 
we couldn't get me dications for her. She 

died and for a long time I reme mber her comi
ng to me  in her shroud, standing at the foot 
of my bed, telling me  everything is going to 
be all right. But other than that, I could go 
where I wanted, I could do anyt
hing I wanted. I used to run 
up and down the bridge from 
one end until they liquidated th
e little ghetto, I had friends ov
er on the other side, I used 
to run over to the other side of the ghetto 
and play in that small ghetto, and then come 
back and go in the big ghetto. As long asyou weren't outside of the fence or hanging on 

the fence, you were pretty well safe.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
16 
 
Q: Did your parents give you any kind of special warnings or advice on how to behave, and 
were they candid with you when you came in
 and said, why is that woma n crying?   
 
A: No, we knew and -- a selection would 
come , that's when you norma lly, after the 
selections, and you -- I was invol
ved in every selection that happened. They didn't have 
to tell you, you heard it from the kids, you heardit from the streets, 
it was a feeling that 
you had, like all the dogs and cats had to be br
ought in to the synagogue and be skinned, 
and I used to play around at synagogue. They were used when the Germans got involved 

in the, Stalingrad, it was very cold, they ha
d to have fur, so they rounded up everything 

they could round up and brought them in to th
e ghetto and slaughtered them and skinned 
them, and I used to play around in that 
synagogue, it was empty, it was deserted, but 
blood and fur, pieces of fur was all over the 
place, at the same  synagogue that I told you 
about that I used to run up and down the stai
rs. That was one of the things. Of course 
when Passover came around I reme mber going withmy grandmother to that same  ya rd of 
the synagogue and they had a big kettle boi
ling away, and everybody used to put their 
silver in to ma ke it kosher for Passover, and then
 they used to take the rest of it, bury it in 
the yard for the appropriate period of time, 
because the earth has a cleansing thing, before 
we could use it for Passover. So in the begi
nning we celebrated Passover, celebrated the 
holidays. I don't know why this particular st
ands out in my mind, 
but that particular 
Passover stands out in my mi nd. I also saw how
 they used to ma ke ma tzo. They ma de 
that in the ghetto, you had that available. 
Those holidays we had, other than, and they 
were celebrated at home, it was not celebr
ated in a public ma nner. Everybody, you know, 
the Germans didn't care about your holidays, a
nd there was no time off, you just did what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
17 
 
had to be done, but when you came home , th
e holiday spirit was there, so we did 
celebrate those holidays.  
 
A: The synagogues were all taken over?   

 

Q: That'scorrect. 

 

A: Were there schools for 
kids in the ghetto.  
 

Q: For me  at that time , no. Individuals possibl
e had some  school. The fi
rst time that I went 
to school was after we came  back to Kovno, 
after the liberation fr
om the ghetto, after 
living in to that hole, then I had school for 
about six months, but other than that, no we , I 
didn't go to any school, it was all da
y long you were out in the street.  
 

Q: When you talked about the sm
all ghetto and the large ghetto?  
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Was there reason for people to live in one 
or the other, or it was just where everybody 
lived?  
 

A: Well, what had happened when the -- of course we were already in by fortune, because 
our house was occupied by the Lithuanian neig
hbors, but when people started comi ng in, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
18 
 
the Kovno ghetto became a concentr
ation camp, it started out as a ghetto, then it became  
a concentration camp as they started importi
ng Jews for deportation from other areas. The 
ghetto became  too s mal l. Everybody had to
 double up, or triple up. Our house was at 
ma xi mu m c a pacity with as ma ny pe ople as we had, but wherever there wa s room, the 
Germans or the Judenrat used to say, you ha
ve room for one more, you take one more, 
two more or whatever. Then they had to, 
because  of the exchanges, they exchanged 

houses because some  of the people that live
d where the small ghetto was moved into the 
area where the Jews went out of, so those houses became vacant, so the Germans put wire 

around those houses and ma de that into the 
small ghetto and populated it with the Jews, 
the overflow of the big ghetto until they liqui dated it.  
 

Q: So, what happened when they liquidated th
e sma ll ghetto, did you, were you part of that, 
did you see that?   
 

A: It was when they had the large selection, th
ey liquidated the small 
ghetto first, put them 
into the big ghetto, as the big ghetto st
arted getting less populated, as they were 
liquidating the, what was it, ten thousand I thi
nk, that they killed in that big, no thirty 
thousand in big selection, then the big ghetto
 had room, they liquidated the small ghetto 
into the big ghetto and 
took the bridge away.  
 

Q: But, tell me  what a sele
ction, explain to me  what we
nt on at that selection.  
 

A: At a selection . . .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
19 
 
 
Q: Not the big selection, but you were talki
ng first about the small ghetto, which I know 
came first.  
 

A: No, the large ghetto came first.  

 

Q: The liquidation of the small ghetto came before  the big action.  

 

A: That's true, but you said the 
big ghetto was formed first.  

06:41 
Q: Right. 

 

A: Then, because it was overpopulated, they formed the small ghetto.  
 
Q: Okay. 

 

A: And joined them together with a bridge, 
because they had to have the throughway in 
order to continue with traffic, so it was 
joined by a bridge. Then as the large ghetto, 
through the selections, became less dense, they
 liquidated the small 
ghetto by a selection, 
for those that went off and 
those that were left  were
 put into the big ghetto.  
 

Q: Do you remember that event, that da
y when the small ghetto was liquidated?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
20 
 
A: No, I just reme mber a family friend of our
s by the name  of Sidra, who was a very close 
fa mily fr iend of ours, they were in the small ghetto to st ar t with and when it was 
liquidated, he was an expert electrician and so
 was his son. They were put into the large 
ghetto, and by the way they did survive, he recently died.  
 

Q: You don't reme mber the hospital or the fire?   

 

A: I don't reme mber that, no.  

 

Q: Do you remember . . .  

 

A: I do reme mb er when my father and I came b
ack to the ghetto, that the ghetto was still on 
fire, it was still smoldering.  
 

Q: ______liberation. 

 

A: That was at liberation.  

 

Q: Do you remember the big action?  

 

A: I reme mber the big action, I can't  reme mber 
all the details, I know th
at the fa mily was all 
together, we were all in one group, we were
 on a tremendous field that had a couple of 
hundred, let me  see about forty, fifty t
housand people came out to the big action. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
21 
 
Everybody in the ghetto had to go to that selec
tion, and that the guy that was in charge of 
the selection selected left and right, left 
and right, they didn't te
ll you that you were going 
to die if you were going to the left, but that
's  what ended up. Those, all those unskilled, 

well unskilled to them, went to the left, and t
hose that he felt had 
a use to the -- for the 
Germans went to the right. I remember stay
ing out there with my fa mily and that we 
survived and a lot of people didn't.  
 

Q: Do you have any feeling about what 
it was like that day?  Any images?   
 

A: The images that you had is that you, if you 
could, you knew that it was caused by Hitler, 
you wanted to kill Hitler, you wished that
 you were a superhuman being and that you 
could kill Hitler and have  a stop to all th
is, because you didn't know that pe ople were 
dying, well you did know what mi ght be ha
ppening, but you felt superhuman. A young 
person, and for me  actually, until I got into my 
fifties, I really had 
no concept of death. 
You never think it's going to happen to you. I've done some  extremely stupid and 

dangerous things and survived, that now that 
I think about it, why di
d I take that chance?  
It was utterly stupid, my chances were, but
 it's not going to happen to you, it always 

happens to the next guy. You are invincible
, you can walk into a burning oven and you're 
not going to get burned, the flames are going to 
go away. You just feel that you're totally 
invincible and you just don't think anything 
bad is going to happen to you. And it's only 
when you come  into your fifties that you start 
to realize, hey my lif
e is comi ng to an end, 
it's going to end, nothing I can do to stop it.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
22 
 
Q: What were the older people doing 
at the big selection, do you reme mber?   
06:44 
A: Everybody was extremely quiet, I don't re
me mbe r  anybody, I reme mber that incident 
where I told you where the guy with the red 
flag, but nothing like 
that ever happened 
during the big selection, ev
erybody was just huddling to 
themselves and everybody was 
pre-occupied with their own thoughts, they 
didn't really know what was going to happen 
to them, they figured ma ybe they were goi
ng on a nice trip so mewhere, because that's 

what it was supposed to have been, and the peopl
e are being selected are going to be sent 
off to some  nice place, and I'm sure that some
 that went to the right mi ght have wished 
that they went to the left, un
til they found out what happened.  
 

Q: Do you remember any other actions or brut
ality that happened while you were living in 
the ghetto?  More specific incidences?  
 

A: The one thing that is very difficult for me
 to get out of my mi
nd is a young ma n, and I 
don't re me mber his name , got caught at a gate
, he got caught bringi
ng in some  bread, and 
they were going to make an example out of him,  and they built a gallows in the same 

square where they had the big selection, 
and everybody, children, old people, it didn't 
ma tter whether you were sick, whether you we
re well, everybody had to come  out and 
watch the hanging. And they hung him with the n
oose under his chin so that he wouldn't  
die imme diately, and I reme mber seeing him, I 
don't know if you've ev
er been fishing, or 
if you've ever caught a fish, but when you cat
ch a fish, and when you pull him out of t he 
water, he's on the line, the way he thrash
es about, that's  the way that young ma n was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
23 
 
thrashing about for agonizing mi nutes, a
nd everybody had to watch while he was 
thrashing about on the gallows. And they wouldn't  cut him down until ever y indivi dual 
that was on a work detail, had to be ma rche
d out and had to watch him hanging there, and 
after every individual had seen him, those that
 were away outside of the ghetto, at work, 
on the way home  they had to pass by his gallows before they would allow them to go 

home , before they would cut him down.  
 

Q: Well that certainly ___?? ____ 
impression. Did you have a good or bad impression of the 
Jewish police in
 the ghetto?  
06:46:30 
A: I didn't have much to do with the Jewish poli
ce, the only time  that I had any dealings with 
them is when they separated mother and me
 from her family. They came , they grabbed 

up my mother's fa mily, which was my grandmot
her, my grandfather, two brothers and a 
sister, and forced them off into the truck. Mo
ther and I tried to follow and they tore us 
apart. Other than that I had no dealing with 
the Jewish police. I was too young to be of 
any troublesome  for them and I wasn't  any troub
le so they stayed their wa y, I stayed my 
way.  
 

Q: Did German police come  
into the ghetto at  all?  
 

A: Not where we were involved. I saw them b
ecause we were a block away from the main 
gate. The house that we lived in with my 
grandparents was about a block, a block and a 

half away from the main gate, so I did see th
em quite frequently. They came  in for one or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
24 
 
two selections, but other than
 that the Germans would not 
come  into the ghetto proper, 
they didn't come in.  
 
Q: Your sister was already deceased?  

06:48 
A: She died. She died as soon as we came  bac
k, be fore the ghetto was, before the wires were 
put up, she died.  
 

Q: Anything else about the ghetto that
 you reme mbe r , that stands out?   
 

A: Only the escape.  

 

Q: Okay, let me see, how much time do we have on this tape now?  Then why don't you tell 
me  about the escape?  
 

A: Originally mother wanted me  to go stay with
 a gentile, trying to save my life when she 
started hearing some  of the things. And they trie
d to sell me  on the idea of that he would 
be good to me , he would have a mo torcycle, I 
would have some  toys and all that kind of 

things, and I started to weaken, and then my fa
ther came and said, well he just a soon that 
what happens to one of us is going to happen 
to all of us, and that's  when the decision 
was ma de and he and mother ma de all 
the arrangements for us to escape.  
 

Q: Let me  just ask you when this was?    

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
25 
 
 
A: This was November of '4 3, I believe it was, 
or some  ti me  in that winter area. The streets 
in Slobotka were ma de out of big cobblest
ones. Not ma tched cobblestones, a big stone 
here, a big stone there, they
 had a lot of cobblestones, 
and the guards had hob nailed 
boots so you could hear as they were walk
ing up and down, patrolling the fence. When 
we 06:50  heard the guard, at the softest 
point where you could barely hear him, you 
knew that he was at the furthest point away
 from you. At that point, my fa ther cut the 
barbed wire, and I was the first one through the 
two sets of barb wire, and I was told to 
hide in a yard across the way, and not to
 ma ke any sound whatsoever, no ma tter what 
happened, not to say anything. And I ma de my wa
y into that yard, and all the time that I 
was in that yard, things we
re going through my head as to what would I say to the 
neighbor if he decided to come  out into the ya
rd, what was I doing there? If I told him the 
truth, certainly he would call th
e guard, and I'd be executed. So what lie would I be able 
to tell him?  I got lost or what
ever, I never came to any conclu
sion as to what I would ever 
tell him if he ever came  out, but those 
were the thoughts that were going through my 
mi nd as to what I could conceivably tell hi
m, if he came out to the yard. And what 
seemed like an eternity, my mother was the 
next one to come out, and she couldn't speak 
to me , so she had to find me  by go and touching the ground ha nd over hand until she 

touched me . The night wa s extremely, it was pitch black, no moon, nothing, it was, you 

just coul dn't see anythi ng. And it's only because 
we knew that area so well that  we were 
able to come  into contact with one another,
 and knew exactly our 
bearings, because if 
you're right handed and you walk a 
straight line even in the da
rk you will drift off to the 
right, but all of us seeme d to have drif
ted the right amount and I don't know how long it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
26 
 
took mother to find me , but I could hear her, 
and even though I could hear her, I couldn't  
say anything to her.  
06:52 
Q: Let me just ask, was this scary fo
r you, was this a gr
eat adventure?   
 
A: It was scary as hell, I was petrified. I reme
mber that right now, I was petrified, but that's  
the only choice, it was not a play [game ]. Th
is was not an adventure, this particular 
instance. The rest of it wasn't  bad, I went 
on my first hayride, where I was buried in the 
hay, in the wagon, hidden.  
 

Q: So your father got out then after?   

 

A: My father was the last one out, and then th
ey, I don't know e xactly, I 
can't  relate where or 
how far we had to go before we got to
 the wagon, but we got, we hooked up with a 
far mer and a wagon and I was hidden inside
 the wa gon. I do reme mber as the wagon was 
going, and when we had finally got to a stopping 
point, my father told my mother that he 
had passed one of his school friends who was 
a Lithuanian murderer, my father knew for 
sure because he saw him kill some  people,
 and he was a school friend of Daddy's, a 
school ma te. Their eyes me t, but there was 
no recognition, or  at least Daddy didn't see 
where the Lithuanian recognized him, or chos
e not to recognize him as they passed each 
other, because if he had ma de any recognition to
 him, he would have had to kill him, so 
he let us go, let him go by. I guess God move
s in mysterious ways, you never can tell, 
why that particular incident
_happens, but we ma de it safely to the country, the first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
27 
 
portion of the country and then
 a whole new chapter started 
over there, with what we 
were doing in the country. When we got to 
the country, thecountry people are a very 
clannish people, they know each othe r by sm
ell, they know each other by sound, they can 
tell a stranger, they can tell an animal, 
anything. And i mme diately they picked up our 
scent and we  had to keep running from hiding 
place to hi ding place, and I reme mber one 
night where we had to go, and the farmer that 
originally brought us out carried me  on his 
shoulders, and the wind was so bad that I co
uld not breathe, it just completely knocked 
the air out of me . And al l of a sudden he
 dropped to the ground and everybody dropped to 
the ground, he put his ear to the ground becau
se he heard some  strange footsteps way 
away in the snow, and he had us all huddle re
al close together so 
we would look like a 
clump of roc k sticking out of the snow, so 
that we wouldn't be recognized as human 
beings. And when he felt that the danger ha
d passed, he continued to take us to a new 
hiding place. We  hid in some  barns with mi ce,
 we hid in some  houses for a short period 
of time. One of the places that we eventually
 ended up with that gave us our final hiding 
place was a Polish, catholic family, they were extremely religious. They felt that  what 

was being done to the Jews was wrong, and they
 gave us a hiding place. They had a one 
room house. The house was very small, a mud 
hut. The stove that they had was 06:56  
ma de out of stone, where they cooked in it, th
ey baked in it, the heating was in it, it had 
no chimney, so all the smoke would come  in
to the house and if you wanted to, you sit on 
the floor in order for the smoke not to comp
letely burn your eyes out. They had a sheep 
that was ready to give birth to some  little sh
eeps and they brought her in the house so that 
she would be warm during her birthing period. 
And we lived with that sheep and them, 
we stayed when we weren't outside in the 
barn, when we came in to warm up, and for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
28 
 
some thing to eat we stayed in that house. That
 particular farm is wh
ere we had, my father 
had a potato hoe, that he build a hi ding place from . . .  
 
Q: We 'll get to that in a mi nute, I think.  

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: On this tape , because we'r e almost up. We re there other ki ds in the family?   

 

A: My imme di ate family, no.  

 

Q: No, in the, with the Polish people?   

 
A: They had a son. They had a son that used to
 be a musician at ho-
downs, and he was very 
friendly with us, of course he knew that we we
re there in hiding, and we hid in that ma n's 
barn and a couple of times my father helped 
him thresh the wheat with a threshing stick, 
and also we had a grinding mill made out of two big stones with a hole in the mi ddle and 
a stick where you turn that you put grain insi
de of the hole and as you turn the stones, 
eventually it became flour as it got gr ound up. The farmer 's woma n, wife was, liked me  

very much and I'll never forget she made me 
a toy. They killed a pig for some  kind of a  
celebration or whatever and she took the 
bladder from the pig and blew it up, took a 
couple of peas, hard peas and put it inside
, then blew the bladde
r up and made a balloon 
out of it, and as it hardened it became like a ball,
 and she gave it to me  to use as a ball to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
29 
 
play with. Well the peas ma de a lot of noise
, and that was going on the nerves of my 
cousin that was hiding with us
. He just got, it just drove 
him crazy and he grabbed that 
thing and put a knife through it and destroyed 
it, and I reme mber that vaguely, I mean 
vividly. End of Tape 1

  Tape 2  
07:01 
Q: Before we continue on, I ju
st want to ask you about, you know
, if there are other episodes 
in all of this that you as a young boy probably fe
lt a little bit more invulnerable because 
you had parents who were protecting you.  
 

A: Well I always had some body look after me . We
 were, that's  why, one of the reasons we 
never got separated was either one of my pare
nts or the other ones looked after me , or my 
grandmother, so that I was never left vulnera
bl e. One of the instances ha ppened when all 

the me n of our fa mily were away on the workdetails and my mother was, that particular 

day, off and my grandparents, my grandmothe
r was taking care of me  whe n the German 
guards came in and surrounded a quadrant of
 the ghetto, and took us out for another 
selection. And during that selection I reme mber
 telling my mother that, and grandmother, 
don't worry, everythi ng will be all right as t
hough I could do some thing about it, but that 
everythi ng were all right, I've got a feeling th
at it will come out well on it. I had a feeling 
of, everybody knew, of impending doom, of th
ings that were going to happen, but I 
wasn't  totally wiped out or down in the dumps
 about it, I had a rath
er good feeling about 
it, and when it came time for our responsiv
e answer to the guy that was doing the 
selection, my mother spoke up, she became the h
ead of our fa mily unit, and she explained 
to the guard that her husband and father wo
rk on the work detail 
at  the airport, the 
aerodrome, and the aerodrome was an extremel
y vital part and in order not to disrupt 

their well-being, and with her imme diate pr
oper response, we were allowed to go home 
as a family unit again, and we survived that 
selection where a lot of
 people didn't. Hadn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
31 
 
she spoken up or had the presence of mi nd to 
say how vital the job was that her husband 
and father and brothers were
 performi ng, we would probabl
y not have been alive and 
been sent off to the ninth fortress, where th
ey sent a lot of people off to be killed.  
 
Q: Are you proud of her? 

 

A: Extremely. One of the reasons, while we ar
e on this subject that we had knowledge of 
what was happening on the ninth fortress is 
because one of the young me n in the early 
selections wa s taken out and got 
hit in the foot, and when they hit him in the foot, he fell 
into the grave and his mother a
nd the rest of the family and th
e rest of the people fell over 
top of him. During that night
 when everything was quiet, he
 ma naged to dig his way out, 
and like a fool he ma de his way back to 
the ghetto and explained and told everybody 
what they were doing to the people that we
re taken out of the ghetto and the ninth 
fortress. They were executing them. So ev
erybody knew when the selection came, your 
chances, unless you survived th
e selection, chances were that's where you were headed 
for.  
 

Q: Who were most of the people guarding the ghetto, guarding the work brigade, 
supervising these killings at the forts?   
 

A: The Germans were supervising, but the ki
llings were done by the Lithuanians. The 
guards, like in the very beginning I told you 
about a guard throwing 
a piece of bread at 
me , he was a Lithuanian. Of course they wo
re uniforms, they wearing German unifor ms, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
32 
 
but they were Lithuani an collaborators that
 fully accepted and were
 proud of it. And the 
reason that so ma ny of our homes, the homes th
at we got that were taken away, well the 
collaborators were glad that the Jews were be
ing put in the ghettos,
 because they got free 
home s, free housing, possessions, they went ri
ght after their bosses home, or whoever's 
home  they had in mi nd and occupied it and becam
e settlers in it and that  was it. That 's 
how we found the furniture of my, when we got
 liberated, I guess we'll go into that a little 
later, that one of those neighbors of ours that
 occupied our home , and we proved it was, 
had my aunt 's  furniture in it.  
 

Q: Shall we go back now to . . .  

 

A: When we escaped?  

07:06 
Q: You escaped, you were staying . . .  

 

A: We were staying with a Polish family at which time one of the interesting things was that 
the family was extremely poor, they didn't have much. During the time  that we were in 

the barn they did have a couple of chickens, 
and they had a dog. The dog used to love to 
play around with us and in the morning when 
the chicken used to lay the eggs, the dog 
and I had discovered a hi ding place, so it was 
which one of us would get to the eggs 
before the farmer 's wife would get to the eggs
, so it was if he woul
d get to the eggs, of 
course he would munch them up and drink them, 
if I would grab the egg, I used to take a 
pin and put it in both ends of the eggshell 
and then drink the raw egg. And one of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
33 
 
things after a while I had a
bout four of five e mpty shel
ls, I put a string through it and 
ma de a necklace out of it, it was one of the am
usements I had. It didn't happen frequently, 
but it took a little time, I managed to 
get a few eggs together that way.  
 
Q: Did you give the necklace to your mother?   

 

A: No, I think it broke probably befo
re I reme mber anything else to it.  
 

Q: Do you remember other ways you sp
ent your time, other amusements?   
 

A: Oh, I had a fantastic amusement, I don't know if you know what a 
delousing means, but 
delousing means you de-lice yourself. We  didn'
t have any change of clothes and that's  
how I learned how to count. That -- I would st
ay in the light of a sun ray, take my shirt 
off and look at the lice goi
ng up and down on it and get my two thumbnails together over 
the lice and break, and crack them to kill them
 and count how ma ny I got that particul ar 
day and then see if I could beat my score 
the ne xt day because you couldn't get rid of 

them, I me a n they lived on you forever. Younever had a bath, you didn't have a change 

of clothes and the lice were just some thi
ng that you lived with. So every morning 
whenever you had an opportunity, you take your 
shirt off, or your trousers or whatever 

you could and try to crack as 
ma ny of the lice as you could.  
 

Q: On your shirt, or on your body?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
34 
 
A: They were on your body, but they'd be on 
your shirt, so when you took your shirt off, 
that's -- you'd take a whole batch of them off with you, and the more you killed, the less 
crawled on your body until the next  day when th
ey start all over again because you're, 
you were laying in the ground, you were laying in
 the straw, you didn't have anything to 
bathe with, you just, that's  how you lived, ther
e was nothing you could do
 about it, so that 
was a fun and game  07:09  time, that was the only toys I had.  
 

Q: Now at some point, didn't  
you move from the farmer 's house and barn to another spot?   
 

A: We moved into the potato hole that my father built. My father took two potato holes and 
joined them together and built a room undern
eath the farmer's property, under the potato 
patch, as you mi ght say. It cav
ed in on him, but as he built that thing -- he wasn't  an 
engineer, my father was a lawyer, but he did 
have his wits about hi
m, however he did not 
know that if you're going to dig in the ground, you 
got to have some thing to shore it up or 
it's going to cave in on you. He figured you dig 
in the ground like anything else, it just 
stays there, so he dug in the ground and it 
caved in on him and the farmer's dog, that 
same  one that I used to race for the eggs, 
saved hi s life by getting the farmer 's son to 
excavate him, the farme r 's son was comi ng back from playing at a hoe-down, and the dog 

couldn't dig my father out, so he heard his ma
ster in the -- way away, so he grabbed him 
and started pulling his leg, originally the farm
er's  son kicked him away, because he didn't 
want to be bothered on a Saturday night in
 the mi ddle of the ni
ght after comi ng back 
from a hoe-down, and having a good time, but 
he realized some thing was wrong so he 
followed him and he excavated and got my fa
ther out. But my father built a chamber 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
35 
 
which was about nine foot by twelve foot 
and about five foot high. It was not high 
enough for anybody to stand up. In that chamber, thirteen of us lived for nine months. 
The hole was about two and a ha
lf foot of the ground from
 the potato 07:11  hole, a 
tunnel about two and a half foot by two a
nd a half foot was dug out, and it was 
approxima tely ten foot long. You'd s nake th
rough on your stomach, through that hole and 
that opened up into a chamber that my fath
er had built and fr om the chamber there was 
another ten foot tunnel that le
d to another potato hole. In 
the opening from that potato 
hole was a board that supported 
the potatoes with a, like a ra
bbit snare, a stick and the 
thought was if anybody ever came close, we w
ould pull the stick in, collapsing the door 
and the potatoes would cover up our entran
ce and we would escape through the opposite 
one if possible. If not, we would pull both si
des to give the impr
ession that there was 
nothing but an empty potato hole, and we 
would be buried in that chambe r until 

some body c ould excavate us and one of the things
 that was always my fea r , would we be 
able to dig ourselves out of th
at hole. I realized everythi ng 
worked in theory everythi ng 
worked just great, some body would get us 
out, but with so ma ny pounds of potatoes 
closing up the hole, how would you pull in that
 trap door inside and then how would you 
get the potatoes out in order for you to be 
able to scramble out, so though it was a good 
engineering plan, it was real
ly, if some body really went after us we would have been 
dead, I mean I don't fool myself that we c
ould have survived if some body found the hole. 
Only a 07:13  mi racle and of course I'm here, so a lot of mi racles happened along the 
way, but that was one of the fears, and 
my entertainment during that time beside 
delousing myself was to run back and forth a
ll day long from one hole, potato hole to the 
other potato hole, just going back and forth 
through the tunnel. How 
that thing didn't cave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
36 
 
in, I don't know because the tunnel was not s
hored up, but the tunnel was so far down in 
the ground and was so small that it seemed t
o, the ground itself held and the temperature 
was constant  because it was ten feet undergr
ound so we didn't need any heating, di dn't 
need any air conditioning, it was constantly cold
. And I had in that hole were two of my 
mother's nephews who were my age, they are 
both in Israel right now
, and one of their, 
my uncle's sister-in-law's son, I don't know what 
that makes him to me, but he was in that 
with us. In that particul ar cave there was 
my mot her, my father and me , my uncle, my 
aunt and two children, two of my cousins andtheir wives, one of them was a girlfriend, 
one of them was really a wife and a teacher 
and he r son. There were thirteen of us that 
lived in that thing for nine months.  
 

Q: How did you all find each other? You 
didn't go out of the ghetto together?   
 
A: No, we -- my father and mother and I left fi
rst. My uncle was alrea
dy the local resident as 
you mi ght say. My uncle was a farmer, he was 
a very religious ma n. He always used to 
help the farmers. The fa rmers told him, when they heard 07:15  about what was 
happening in Poland and that the Jews had to
 report everywhere, for him not to report, 
that they would hide him, so
 that he wouldn't go anywhere. 
So he hid in the country and 
during the three and a half year of the occ
upation area, eighty two 
different far mers hid 
him. Pretty soon so many of them were invol
ved that one would not dare tell on the other 
because it would implicate him, so the whole,
 basi cally the whole area hid him. He in 
turn, ma de contact for us to be able to hideout with him. Then his sister-in-law was with 
him, she came to hi m, her name  was Brema I believe, with her son, he was a red-headed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
37 
 
boy. And then my father's cousin came with 
his girlfriend, and then
 his brother and his 
wife came out, and my other cousin and my 
aunt, where I told you I pulled over my wat e r 
on me from the samovar, she came instead of 
my grandparents, and 
my fa ther got very 
upset and they went back to get my grandpa
rents at which time  they ma de a wrong turn 
and got caught and the wa y it was told to us by some  far mers, he was impr isoned and he 

tried to buy his way out of prison with apiece of gold by one of the guys that was 

supposed to be released for being in there fo
r drunkenness, and he figured if he had one 
piece of gold to give him, he had a lot more 
and he started fighting with him and at that 
point they discovered that he was Jewi sh a
nd they ma rched him naked to the ceme tery 

and executed him. So at that point we  had lo
st all hope of getting my father's  fa mily, 
which was still in the ghetto, out.  I --
 we, people frequently ask, did you have any 
weapons?  That particular cousin that got
 executed was involved 
with the underground 
and he had brought us a Luger, a Kolachnikov, which was similar to a .45, a .25 
automa tic, and a potato ma sher, whi c h was 
a hand grenade. I reme mber we had six 
rounds of ammunition for the Luger, we ha
d one magazine full for the Kolachnikov, and 
about twenty-five rounds for the .25 automa tic
. Those were the weapons if we'd be 
captured, that we would be able to fight 
our way out with that so few pieces of 
ammunition, really you couldn't do much except go
 for the hand grenade, it mi ght have 
done you some  good.  
 

Q: I'm a little confused on one point, your uncle who was the farmer?  

 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
38 
 
 
Q: Who ma de a ll these connections, wa
s he also in this
 bunker with you?   
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Yes, I counted him.  

 

Q: I'm sure you did.  

 

A: It was him, his wife and his two sons.  

 
Q: I'm sure you did, I was just a little 
confused after listening to your . . .  
 
A: Once, once, he was hiding in one place, we would be hiding in another place, but once 
my father built the bunker, it was felt safer for 
him to come  j oin us and he  joined us  and 
stayed with us.  
 

Q: Now what did you do for food in this hole?   

 

A: My, this uncle that I was telling you about 
knew every single farmer. He and my father 
used to go out at night and scavenge for 
food to the different far mhouses. Buy some , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
39 
 
07:19  some  would give them, some  of them 
thought they were partisans so they were 
afraid to turn them down, because the farmers,
 if they turned down a partisan, they would 
be ma rked, and once they were ma rked, they knew that execution mi ght not be far away. 
The partisans had absolutely no gumptions at all,
 they would just as 
soon, if they thought 
you were, if you were a collaborator, they'd kill you, or if they thought you were a 

collaborator, and if you turned
 them down when they knew that you had it, they figured 
that ma de you a collaborator as well, so the pa
rtisans that were working that area used to 
give us indi rect prot ection because my father
 and my uncle used to go out scavenging, if 
he went to a place that they didn't know hi m,
 they thought he was with the partisans, 
they'd be afraid, they'd barter with him a
nd just get your stuff and get out, leave, and 
that's  how we used to get our food.  
 

Q: Did your group have contact with any other 
groups in hiding or any partisan groups?  
 

A: No. I believe my father and uncle crossed 
paths with a partisan 
group once or twice while 
they were out scavengi ng because they were
 out in the woods, but we wouldn't tell them 
where we were and they wouldn't tell us wh
ere they were and there were no other groups 
like us in hiding. Rumor s  pretty soon spread 
about my father being 
out there, he was a 
lawyer and like I told you the 
farmers are very clannish and they have a tendency to smell 
out or sniff out strangers in the area, and some
how it got out that a la
wyer was there, that 
he came to lead the partisans, didn't say a
nything about him comi ng to
 hide for his life, 
but that he came  to lead the partisans  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
40 
 
Q: Did you stay in this hole all the time?  
 

A: All the time, except now at night we used to 
go out a little 07:21  b
it. We were afraid to 
go out during the day because if anybody, a
ny stranger at all saw you during the day, it 
was danger for the family as well as for us, but at night, chances of some body being 

there, and once the dog, the area dogs who coul
dn't talk, except at the strangeness, the 
barking and all that would go away, then ther
e wasn't  any barking, the only time that the 
dogs used to raise a hell is when a strange
r, some body that doesn't belong used to come  
out, so we used to go out at ni ght and do some exercise around the hole or occasionally 

we'd go into the farmer's  house, warm up, and then we'd go back to the hole.  
 

Q: So you were in the hole
, did you sing, did you pray?   
 
A: I didn't. My uncle and his sons did. He 
was a very religious individual, extremely 
religious. He  knew all the prayers by heart, 
he didn't need a prayer book and he taught his 
boys. I felt that I wasn't  one of his boys and I didn't have the need and I just didn't.  
 

Q: I reme mber your telling me that it was a 
stor y about a sweater that your mother had 
ma de?   
 

A: When we first came to the country, the c
oncentration camp inma tes had ingenious ways 
of hiding a few things. You always . . .  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
41 
 
Q: This from ghetto or concentration . . .  
 

A: Ghetto, well the ghetto, our ghe
tto became a concentration camp.  
 

Q: While you were there?   

 

A: Yes. When, the difference is, it started out
 as a ghetto, where the local populace was. The 
mome nt they started importing people for 
execution, for exporting, they changed it and 
I've got the order where it was changed 
from a ghetto to a concentration camp, 
Konzentrations Lager, so that when it 
became  a concentration camp, the people had 
different ways of at least hi
ding some thing that if you got out
 or were able to, you could 
barter with it. We  had a few pieces of Russi
an gold coins. My mother had a crocheted 
sweater. She took and the buttons, crocheted th
e buttons, the gold piec
es into the buttons, 
so that it looked just like fabric when you 
buttoned it, buttoned together. While we were 
in the farmer's house, it was very warm, Mo
ther took the sweater off and laid it down. 
The farmer 's  wife admi red the sweater and she picked it up and she says, oh how heavy it 

is, it's unusually heavy. Mother 
immediately told me  in Yiddi
sh, she says, say that you'r e 
cold, and I started shivering and I said I was 
cold so she could take the sweater and wrap 
me  up in it so that the farmer 's wife wouldn'
t become too suspicious that there was gold 
in the sweater.  
 

Q: Any other close calls 
or episodes like that?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
42 
 
A: That's the closest as far as being uncovere
d, the farmer's wife  wasn't  very stupid, the 
reason she said it was, she said have you 
got some thing hidden in it?  Just because 
somebody's a farmer, working very hard, doe
sn't  mean that they haven't got any good 
sense about them, even though without an educ
ation she realized b
ecause, periodically 
we would give them something, some  nicer 
clothing or some thing that we had ma nage d 
to save. That's  the only other close calls. The ot
her interesting thing is 
that we had with us 
a down comforter that when we escaped we t
ook with us from the 07:25  ghetto, a pillow 
and a down comforter. While we were laying in
 the barn and in the straw and everything 
we used that down comf orter 
to cover ourselves and to k
eep ourselves warm. We  would 
huddle together all three of us
 under the down comforter. I ha
ve that comforter right now 
is on my be d, I still have, I wouldn't give it
 up. Also my father ma naged to save his 
wristwatch and his wristwatch 
had a rhodium dial so while we  were under that comforter, 
he always used to keep his hand on top so that
 the fi eld mi ce that came to eat all the gr ain 
and the corn that we were sleeping on w
ould think it was a mouse and they would run 
around all our head and all around but they wouldn't run on our body because, I mean 
they thought it was a cat, so the mi ce would st
ay away because of the rhodium dial, they 
wouldn't bother us. I also have that little gadget
. Other than that the next thing that really 
happened is when we got liberat ed. When we got liberated my 
father was the fi rst one to 
go with the Soviet military, hoping to find some
body still alive in the ghetto. He didn't , 

he came back a day later, and I went back 
on the second trip I went back with him and 
the ghetto was still smoldering. We went to
 one particular place where we  thought wa s 
the hidi ng place of his family, my aunt a
nd perhaps my grandmother. We  found the 
burned body of a woma n that was there. We  don
't  know whether she was my aunt or not, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
43 
 
but we did found my aunt's rati
on card right there, so we knew at one time she was in that 
particular bunker. Whether she was taken away 
or got out or was kill
ed at another time or 
whether that was her burned body, I don't know, 
but when Daddy and I got to the ghetto, 
it was still smoldering, because most of the ghetto was wood and it didn't take much, the 
Germans when they couldn't take all the Jews
 out before the Russians came , were afraid 

that some  of them were in hiding. They knew 
that some  of them were in hiding and they 
couldn't get all of them out so they took 
gasoline and kerosene, doused the houses and 
then torched the ghetto. So the w
hole ghetto was burned to the ground.  
 

Q: Can you describe a little bit what happene
d, you say you were liberate
d, wh at took place?   
 

A: The, my father spotted a Soviet soldier and 
at that point we knew that the Russian army 
had come  into our area and they were pressing forward towards Kovno, and they were, 
we were 07:28  behind the lines, once we were 
behind the lines we were free, so we came  
out of the hole and we no longer had to stay 
in that hole. We  lived at that time until we 
moved back to Kovno, we were in the hole wher
e the, I me an we were out of the hole and 
we lived with the farmer, breathing free air 
and once we got to Kovno, my father started 
looking for a place for us to live, and of course what had happened is the collaborators, 

the Lithuanians that  had collaborated with th
e Germans, ran and left the houses that 
originally were Jewish ho mes to star t with a
nd in pursuit of my aunt's furniture, my father 
found a place that we had gone, the woma n 
that had my aunt 's furniture became a 
German collaborator and she knew the Russians were comi ng, she would be in big 

danger, so she took off with the Germans to 
go back into Germany. She eventually came  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
44 
 
back and we had lived in the place, whic
h was a Jewish home, that had my aunt's 
furniture in it, and that's  where we had estab
lished residence. In that
 particular apartment 
was also a Russian judge, military judge, his name, I reme mb er his name because it was 

such a roma ntic kind of name , Ivan Ivanovitch Ivanov, that wa s his name  and he had a 

daughter name d Luba, which means love, she 
taught me  Russian, and he lived upstairs 
from us, he also had a son, and his son and 
I jointly had a stamp co
llection. And one night 
I would do the stamps, next day he would do the stamps because the apartment that we 

moved into, the collaborator that lived ther
e was a philatelist, he had collected stamps 
from all over the world and they were confis
cated by that Russian j
udge and given to me  
and his son, and the two of us kept the co
llection going. I also ma
de friends with the 
Lithuanian neighbors, but they very seldom
 called me  by my name , it was always Yid, 
which is Lithuanian for Jew, and I reme mber
, I think I mi ght have told you, I don't know 
if I told you on tape or not, where the one unj
ust beating that I got 
from my father, what 
had happened, I was out playing out in the front
 yard and the real tall, young Lithuanian 
picked me  up and sat me  on top 07:31  of a overhang over a door, it was customary in the 
nicer homes to have a little awning-like in fr
ont of the door so that it wouldn't rain up on 
you while you were waiting to ring the bell, a
nd he put me  on top of that awning, and it 
was, I was a small fellow for my age at that ti
me because of lack of vitami ns or whatever 
and I couldn't  get down. I just stood there and I was petrified about jumping down, I was 

going to break a bone so I just stood there a
nd he wouldn't take me , put me , he wouldn't 
take me  back down until my uncle came , my
 uncle came by, he was visiting us and he 
picked me  off of that roof and brought me  
in the house and told Daddy that I had gotten 

up on the roof. Well I tried to tell him that 
I didn't  get up on the roof voluntarily, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
45 
 
didn't do any good, Daddy gave me  a couple of 
good licks and sent me  to my, to the 
room, and I was petrified, I wouldn't leave that
 room, I had to go to the bathroom in the 
worst way and I just wouldn't leave that room 
be cause Daddy told me  to stay there. Then 
mother came by and I told her what had happene
d and she told me  that I could leave the 
room and do what I needed to 
do and my punishme nt was over.  
 
Q: You were living in Kovno or
 Slobotka at this point?   

 

A: Kovno. We  had graduated up to the higher 
echelon, Slobotka was the suburb, but it 
wasn't  what, like what you said a suburb here
, you're thinking of ma nsions, over there, 
that was a step down, it was not a step up, and 
the other thing that 
happened -- if you'r e 
supposed to survive all sorts of
 obstacles that will be put 
in your way, you will survive. 
The one bomb that was dropped by the Germans on 
Lithuania at that particular time, after 
the liberation, the war was still going on, fell in
 our backyard, and by some quirk of fate, 
I did not go to bed when I was supposed t
o. Daddy was in Moscow on orders for the 
Soviet governme nt because he was in charge
 of a -- five co-operatives, a leather 

co-operative for ma king boots, a candy co-ope
rative, a where you ma ke flour, a flour 
mill, he was in charge of a bakery, and he had gone to Moscow to make all proper 

arrangements for what he needed for that
 thing. And the plane flew over and dropped a 
bomb in our backyard, it was a small bom
b, it destroyed the house that was in that 
backyard and shrapnel we nt through the windowof the bedroom that I was going to sleep 

in with Mother, we were using the same  
bedroom, and shrapnel went into our bed and 
tore the bed to shreds, all the linen, but for so
me  reason or other, that
 particular night, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
46 
 
didn't go to bed at the time  that I was norma lly supposed to, and we survived that 
particular incident, which is a mi racle in itse
lf that had I been in bed, I would have been 
dead.  
07:34 
Q: When you went into the ghetto on your 
return to Kovno, did you run into anybody who 
survived it?  
 

A: Nobody that I knew. My father ran into
 some  people that he knew, and once we 
established residence in Kovno, 
a lot of the survivors came to
 our house. Mother used to 
fix them food, fix them a  package, even some
 of the heroes. There were a couple of Jews 
that joined the Soviet military and one of 
them in particular became [Russian spoken 
here], which was the highest medal that the Ru
ssians could give. Had he not been Jewish, 
he would have won that medal three times, but
 because he wa s a Jew they only gave it to 
him once. He ended up in Israel, I think his name  was Wa lensky. He came  to our house 
and told us what was going on during that time.
 His fa mily got completely destroyed and 
he says, and I reme mber it like the day he was,
 I was fascinated with what he had to say, 
he said that one particular night he got 
drunk, he was a commander of a unit, and he 
started crying and he said when he stopped cr
ying he said, let's go for yaz i ks, that's  a 
Russian word for tongues, and they att
acked a German outpost and cut everybody's 
tongue out. He said that night
 was the night that his fam
ily was destroyed, and he 
survived, he went to Israel, the Soviets finall
y let him go, originally th
ey didn't want to let 
him go because he was such a decorated soldier,
 but he got to Israel. And then some  of 
the other people that survived it were watc
hing the burning of the ghetto, their particular 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
47 
 
house didn't catch fire, they were in hiding, they came  by the house, I don't reme mber the 
name . They had a beautiful daughter, I reme mber
 that, but they told us about what was 
happening at the ghetto, and ma ny of the people that came back, I was too young, none of 

my friends, I ma de a couple of new friends, who had lived down the block from us, they 

were Jewish boys, they were sons of an engi
neer, and I reme mber they had some  of the 
kind of drawings from Buck Rogers time  a
bout flying around in the sky with jet belts and 
all that kind of stuff, which was far fetched in those days, and 
I said one of those days I'd 
like to live to do that and eventually I b
ecame a pilot and ma ybe that was one of the 
things that drove me  on. But other than that, 
none of the friends that
 I had in the ghetto 
had survived. Two of them, one of them 
survived, but he couldn't speak any more 
Yiddish, he was given away to a 07:37  fa m
ily that hid him and converted him to, he 
spoke Lithuanian totally and when he was 
rescued, now he couldn't speak a word of 
Yiddish, he spoke only Lithuani
an. He survived and his fath
er survived, his mother was 
killed.  
 

Q: So did you start school
 at this point?  
 

A: At this point a school was started.  

 

Q: A Jewish school?   

 

A: A Jewish school. And I went to that school
 and I also was in the choir. I reme mber 
because they told me I couldn't carry a tune in
 a bucket and told me to
 get out of the choir 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
48 
 
and then found out it wasn't  me  that couldn't 
carry the tune, and asked me  to come  back 
and I refused to come  back and it was a lot of fun.  
 
Q: So the me mories of going back to Kovno were okay?   

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: It was nice to be back?   

 

A: Right. A lot more pleasant than when we left, but . . .  

 

Q: And the Jewish community started to re-est ablish itsel f?   

 
A: Yes it did, started out with a school, starte
d out with a synagogue, as everybody started 
comi ng back it started comi ng back at that 
particular point, while it was very fluid 
because the Soviet Union wasn't  real concerne
d about the Jews at that time as such. We 
had some  close calls. Mother, a drunken Russi
an soldier called her the killer of Lenin, 
and we thought we really would have an inci
dent. He said the Jews killed Lenin. So 
anti-Semitism was, amongst the Russian soldiers was quite pr edominant and at that point 
I was very scared because I was small, I c
ouldn't really do a whol
e lot about it and the 
soldiers were drunk, and they carried on and I 
was really afraid for her life and mi ne too 
at that point. I believe what happened is that
 the judge that lived above us happened to 
come home and told those soldiers he was 
a high ranking offi cer in the Soviet military 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
49 
 
and he told them to take off and they did 
because there was some  kind of a  rubber factor y 
right across the street from us
, which was guarded by Soviet soldiers, and I used to play 
with those soldiers quite a bit. Also one tim
e my  father's boss came home, Mother used to 
fix very good meals and whenever he was in to
wn he used to come  and I used to be 
fascinated. One time he had a couple of dri
nks, opened up the back window and took his 
machine gun and started firing away. And I was very fascinated with his gun so he just 

gave it to me, he took out his revolver and ga
ve it to me , he took out the ma gazine and 
thought everything was fine, well I didn't know 
too much about guns at that time , but I 
did know that you don't point it at people, I poin
t it to the floor and pul
led the trigger, and 
it fired right between his feet. 
He never gave me  his gun again. Up to that point, that's  
about where we are with that, then . . .  
 

Q: You stayed back, you stayed in Kovno how long?   
 
A: Probably about a year, or clos
e to a year. When my father was declared an enemy of the 
Soviet Republic on the loudspeakers. Radios 
were not very prevalent in those days and 

they had an area that we cal
led _______ that was a very beau
tiful roadway with trees in 
the mi ddle and it was a very, two sided stre
et, divided with a me dian, a nice me dian, 
grassy me dian and on that me dian they ha
d speakers, and on that  speaker one of the 
announcers declared my  father to be an en
emy of the Soviet Republic even though his 
co-operatives won the cherishe
d red fl ag. If your co-operativ
es ma de the quota or above, 
the Soviet governme nt gave you, as a thing 
of honor, a red flag which you used at a 
parade on May Day, and he won the outstan
ding award of the red flag and shortly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
50 
 
thereafter he was declared an enemy of th
e Soviet Republic. Well my mother's maiden 
name is Butremovitch and the Russian were repatriating the Poles back to their, to 
Poland. We  quickly ma de, my parents quickly ma de, had forged papers ma de, with her 

ma iden na me being the primary name  of 
Butremovitch, Butremovitches, repatriating 
them to Poland. With those papers my father 
hired a driver that we had acquainted from 
NKGB, whi c h was the Russian secret service,
 with a big truck and that night we got 
loaded on the truck and wouldn't you know it 
was a night that I didn't have the stamp 

collection, and I didn't dare go up, ask for the 
stamp collection for that night and we took 
off with that truck. We  took off for white 
Russia, on our way to Poland, trying to ma ke 
our way to the American zone, trying to go in
to Germany. So we ma de it part of the way 
and then we stopped at a way 
point, I don't know how we ca me about it, but we came  to a 
Jewish fa mily that lived in white Russia 
and they put us up until another or ganization 
could help us get into Warsaw. During our stay 
there, I went out with 
the fa mily's  son. At 
that time I was nine years old and the boy was 
six years old and we went out skating. The 
way we skated, it was winter time, we had a 
couple of sticks of wood and you'd step on 
the sticks of wood and make them out of sk
ates, we didn't know anything about skis, we 
used them as skates. We nt out on a lake
 and a few days before that, somebody fell 
through that lake, through the 
ice, it was not completely frozen over, but I had all the 
answers and I went out on that lake with 
those sticks and fell through the same  hole and 
again, if you got to survive, you got to surv
ive, I didn't know how to
 swim, never swam a 
stroke in my  life until I came  to the United 
States. So he said to me  [Russ i an spoken 
here], he said to me  in Russian, at that time I spoke fluent Russian, I should give him my 

hand. I gave him my hand and grabbed on th
e ice and kept breaking and breaking and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
51 
 
breaking and breaking, fi nally I 
got hold of a piece of ice and ma naged, he ma naged to 
pull me  ashore and ma de our way back to the house and gave me  some  hot tea and 
warmed me  up and dried out my clothes and a 
few days later we ma de our way to Poland. 
In Poland, in Wa rsaw, a Jewish organization he
lped us, they put us up, we slept on table 
that night and from there we were going to 
07:45  try to ma ke our way to Germany. On 
the way from there, my -- there was a group 
of people, and some how my  father always 
seems to be selected as the leader. They ask 
him to take a group w
ith him to the trai ns, 
the Russians had all the trains under, well m
ilitary move ment and all that. My father 
ma naged to talk to one of the officers,
 bribed him with bot
tle of some  ______and 
some thing else, and he allowed us to get on a ca
ttle car. With that cattle car, we went on 
to Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, the Czech border guards put everybody in a guard 

house, or a holding place and I reme mb
er everybody running around saying where are 
your valuables?  Throw them in that crack, they 
tried to hide their valuables, not to have 
any so when the guards would catch them, 
they would be displaced persons. That 
particular crack has got hundreds of thousands of
 dollars of gold in that crack. The guards 
questioned us and turned us around and sent us
 back. That night we got part of the way 

back and Mother and Da d decided on our ow
n, just the three of us, we would go through 
the border and find a hole in th
e border to go through. It wa
s called no-ma n's land where 
we were. I got into no ma n's land and I said, 
I can't take another step. I don't care what 
they do to me , they can do anything they want
, I'm just not going any further, and they, 
on my back I had that down blanket in a ruck
sack. They grabbed me  by that rucksack and 
the two of them carried me the rest of the way until we got into Germany. We got into 

Germany, we were totally lost, we didn't know where we had to go, so Daddy walked 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
52 
 
over to a house and knocked on the door. Out ca
me a tall German in a undershirt and my 
father told hi m that he was lost with his fa
mily and that he tried to get across the border 
to the American zone. We were in the S oviet zone. The guy said, okay, and closed the 
door and disappeared. A few mi nutes later th
e guy came back to the door, opened the 
door in a full German unifor
m. Gun holster, tunic, helmet
, totally dressed as a East 
German gua rd, and he says, come  on withme . At that point Da ddy thought we were 

again caught and that was the end of it, we
'd be imprisoned again, and again we don't 
know why, there's no explanation to it, the guy 
walked us to the guard, told him to open 
up the gate, he was an officer, he opened up 
the railing that bars the people from going 
through and sent us through to the American 
zone. At that time  when we  got to the 
American zone, you could still sme ll the sten
ch of the bodies under the rubble. The city 
was totally bo mbed out. From Berlin we ma
de our way to Munich and in Munich we 
lived in a place called Prinz Regenten Strasse
. It was name d after one of the princes. 
There was a skating rink where the American sold
iers used to go to all the time, there was 
a theater there, and we lived with a German
 fa mily. They of course, nobody belonged to 
the Nazi party. Nobody was a Nazi, they were ju
st absolutely the finest, he was a doctor, 
they were just the finest, 
upstanding people that you could po
ssibly imagine. They had a 
son and a daughter. She played piano, they ha
d a beautiful piano, I can't  think of the 
name  of it, like a Steinway but it was ma de
, it wasn't  a square one, it was a grand, baby 
grand. She used to teach me  some  pia no, Mo
ther wanted me to be cultured, taught me 

some piano, gave me some piano lessons
. One day while I wa s snooping around I ended 
my way up in the attic, got up in the attic, 
found German flags, guns, swords, of course 
nobody knew anything about them, they didn't know where, they just happened to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
53 
 
there, nobody knew a thing about them. Of c
ourse we found as we started digging, he 
was a me mber of the Nazi part
y. He was forced, unfor
tunate fellow, he was forced into it. 
We 07:51  also, before we moved in there, 
Daddy had found an apar
tment because of his 
job that he had working for the American Jo
int Distribution Co mmittee.
 I was, because of 
my ill health and Mother's, we were sent off to Santa Tillian( ph), which is a resort  ar ea 
that they put a lot of DP's in ill heal th fo
r recuperation ther e. I stayed there for a while 
with Mother and they used to have some  nunne
ries or some  priests around at that area, 
and they had beautiful vegetable gardens. I us
ed to go around and like grapes, that kind of 
things they used to have over there, and they 
used to eat some of the fruit, also the woods 
were healthy. And while going through the 
woods we also found Germa n flags and, 
nobody had anything to do with it, but the flar
e guns, I found an unexploded mi ssile over 
there that we turned into the CID. That was 
just some  of the things that we experienced. 
Once we got to Prinz Regenten Strasse, and 
we lived, I used to go skiing again on boards, 
right next to the school and I did go to school
, that's  where I rea
lly got mo st of my 
schooling for the six mo nths that we were i
n, more than six months, about nine months 

that we were in Munich, we had a Jewish 
school, had a very strong 
moveme nt for freeing 
Israel that was prior to the state of Israel 
being -- it was still Palestine, where we, the 
school was always having rallies to let th
e Jews go to Palest ine. Daddy built the first 
synagogue that they ha d over there. He was 
also became very good friends with a Rabbi 
Klausner, that was his name , he was  an Ar
my chaplain and Klausner went around all 
over, and he found five Sifrei Torah, the To
rah scrolls and he brought them back in his 
car on a Saturday and my father said, Rabbi, on a Saturday, how could you do such a 

thing?  His answer was to my father, he 
said, to save a Sefer_Torah, you can do it any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
54 
 
day, and those were the five Torah scrolls that
 they used in the first synagogue. I also 
reme mber where we had the first Passover in 
Muni ch, in the same 
museum where Hitler 
said he was going to display the last Jew, 
and we had all the survivors that lived in 
Munich in that museum having that Passove
r dinner, which was organized with Rabbi 
Klausner and my father and German waiters 
waited on the Jews who they were going to 
annihilate. It was, it was, in Munich it wa
s quite a life, we were very fortunate, Daddy 
had a big position, he was in charge of all th
e vehicles, trucks, cars,
 busses. We  went to 
Berchtesgarden, rode in Hitler's elevator, wh
ich was his private el evator , chauffeured me 
up to his tea house. That, I was able to see th
at. It was a much dese
rved, I think at that 
point, revenge on the Germans.  
 

Q: Why had you chosen to go to Munic
h, how did your father get this job?   
 
A: He knew of some body t hat had 
that particular job and he to
ld them that he was leaving 
for the United States and that my father was 
the best repl acement for it, so Jankel Levin, 
he lives in Ne w York right now, was leavi
ng for the United States and he recommende d 
my father, so my father got the job, b
ecause of hi s knowledge, his skill and his 
ma nage me nt  abilities.  
 

Q: This was some body who orig
inally was from Kovno?   
 

A: Yes, and my  father took over that job and 
by having that job, all th
e vehicles that were 
used by any of the off duty Jewish, or
 the people from the United Restitution 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
55 
 
Organization, there was a United Restitution Or
ganization, they or AJDC, American Joint 
Distribution Committee had to come  to 
Daddy for a vehicle so he ma de ma ny good 
friends and through that he was able to empl
oy a lot of the holocaust survivors, he was 
responsible to putting them in American unifo
rms. By being uniformed, they did not have 

quite the problem with anti-Semitism fr om the Germans. They also had gotten pr ivileges, 

limited privileges to the PX, as limited. He al
so was able to get them some  scrip and 
other things, so all his drivers were unifor me d pe rsonnel. He wasn't , but all his people 

were uniformed personnel.  
 

Q: There was anti-Semitism in
 Germany after the war?  
 

A: Oh, yes. Those that, wherever they coul
d, there was some , a lot of Jews in Germany 
themselves lost their lives if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time  by 
themselves they were killed. It was hard to 
find who did it, it just ha
ppened, so they were 
much more secure and they had benefits, it
's  like when you go to work here right now, 
you want a benefit package, one of the bene
fits was the American uniform which gave 
you respect, prestige and a lot 
of other things that you didn't 
get as civilian, and then I 
learned how to drive a jeep while I wa s at 
that, because of that, and my father was 
instrumental in helping a lot of Jews escap
e with the illegal immi
gration by giving them 
trucks to take the Jews to the ships in Constanza, if they boarded the ships there of 
course, some  of them ne ver ma de it to Palest
ine, they were caught and put into Cyprus, 
but he got them on those ships, whichever one
s ma de it, ma de it. That was one of the 

things that he had, you could al
ways tell an Amer ican vehicl
e from the others because the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
56 
 
gasoline was extremely difficult to come  by. He
 had plenty of it, but the German was 
benzene, which was white and the American ga soline was red and that's one of the things 
that military used to al ways check when they'd fi nd a vehicl e, and that was one of his 

responsibilities, too. End of Tape 2

Q: The last question we have , how you became such a wild dresser.  

 

A: You are wrong.  

 

Q: Okay, life in Munich, you 
were there for how long?   
 

A: We were there for about ni
ne months, ma ybe a little longer.
 Li fe in Munich for me  wa s 
really great, I had no problems, of course
 I wasn't too involved with getting the 
certificates for us to go to Israel where, my
 father was always a 
Zionist, however we got 
papers for the United States, which we  were
 very glad about, but
 before you got your 
admi ssion papers, you had to go to the American
 Consul, and the American Consul, there 
were four, five different examiners, one of
 them was an extremely tough examiner, and 
everybody that got to him, as a rule was re
jected and denied admi ssion to the United 
States and I reme mber listening to people te
lling my father, if you go into the Consul 
office and if you get that examiner, chances of
 you going to the United States are nil, so 
be very careful and try to position yourse
lf, as though you had a choice, you got lots you 
know, as you get picked, that's  how you go, coul
d have any choice as to go to which 
examiner you could go to, but as luck would have
 it we drew that part
icular examiner and 
we got in there and he held up some  colore
d thread and asked what color this was and 
asked some  other questions, really some  of 
the m to ask were stupid, but were you color 
blind and did you have any diseases and all 
the normal questions that you norma lly ask, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
58 
 
but to me  they didn't seem to ma ke much 
sense and shortly thereafter he says, you're 
okay, 08:03  you're free to go and when we left
 that room Daddy was sure that we had 
gotten rejected because we were in there for 
such a short period of time, we didn't get the 
norma l, long grilling that ever
ybody else did, we had absolutely no idea what Pepsi Cola 
meant to anybody. The ma in concern was of cour
se that you would not be a liability to 
the governme nt when you came to the United States and when the examiner saw that 
guarantors for us was Pepsi Cola company, 
he didn't have any kind of problems or 
worries whatsoever.  
 

Q: You need to tell us for the record 
how you had this guarantor with Pepsi.  
 

A: My uncle wa s, had a franchise for the Richmond, Virginia area of Pepsi Cola. When we 
got liberated, my mother wrote to
 her sister. Her sister came  ov
er here  in the twenties, my 
grandmother became widowed through an accident
 and she had three children at the time, 

four children. She couldn't  support them as 
a wi dow, so my aunt who was over here, my 
grandmother's sister was in the United States
 ma rried to my uncle and he offered or she 

rather offered to take my aunt and uncle, my mot her's sister and brother, bring them t o 

the United St ates and live  with them, so they
 went to the United States. My mother on 

liberation wrote to her sister, 
telling her of her plight a
nd my uncle imme diately, through 
some  conne ctions, he was very generous and extremely well known in the community, 

and with the political process, knew the 08:05 
 process and got to the senator and they 
immediately sent us documentation to come
 to the United States, so he became our 
guarantor, as the Pepsi Cola, that we  would 
not lack employment or be a burden to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
59 
 
governme nt and we basically waltzed in and waltzed out of the office. Everybody 
couldn't believe of our fortune, how come  that
, so quick and we got accepted. Daddy says 
well if you don't press too hard, I guess that's
 the way things go, and we really didn't 

know why we got accepted so quickly until at 
a later time  we put everything together, so 
we got our papers to come to the United 
States, and we got our papers to go to 
Bremerhaven in order, Br emerhaven means the port of Breme n in Germany, and for 

some  reason or other, our ship was dela
yed and I don't know how ma ny weeks we were 

in Bremerhaven waiting to board a ship. I re
me mber they had swings over there and I 
was playing with the kids, seeing how high I co
uld go up in the swing and that's all I can 
reme mber at Bremerhaven is just going back
 and forth on the swi
ng. We  finally got on 
the ship and it was a troop 
carrier, the SS Marina Maryla
nd, St eamship Marina Maryland, 
which was used as a liberty ship. The bunks we
re about sixteen inches apart, ma ybe and 
there were four to eight bunks and everybody 
lived like a sardine on the ship. Everybody 
got on the ship with our meager belongings. We
 had twenty dollars for the three of us, 

plus a bunch of baggage, which everybody kept 
telling us that if you had a Leica, you 
wouldn't have to worry about it, you can sell
 the Leica and ma ke some  money so you can 
live on it, and they said if you take certain t
ype of dishes, you can take the dishes and you 
can sell the dishes, so Mother had bought di
shes with all 08:07our
 whatever money we 
had and we bought that Leica, 
and we were totally broke, 
we had absolutely no money, 
bunch of garbage, and with the twenty dollars 
that we had in American currency that was 
given to us, we were on the ship. I reme mber once we got on the ship and got under wa y, 

people were running around with Coca-Colas 
and sunglasses and I 
told Daddy I really 
would like to have a Coca-Cola and sunglasse
s. We couldn't afford any Coca-Cola and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
60 
 
sunglasses, but like I said, I 
was a spoiled brat so they 
took a dollar and spent it on 
Coca-Cola and sunglasses for me , and then th
e ship broke down, a
nd we were wallowing, 
I mean no stabilizer, no nothing, 
we were out in the sea, 
no engines, no power, just 
wallowing back and forth and everybody got si
ck but me . And Mother kept stuffing food 
at me . That's  the one thing you know, oranges 
were aplenty and we hadn't had an orange 
or seen an orange in God knows when, so she 
wouldn't eat, whenever they gave us me als, 
ship's meals, they always pushed it on me, until fi nally I couldn't eat any more either  
because the ship wallowi ng around. After twen
ty-four hours they ma nage d to fix the 
engines and we got into, in fact my birthday 
was on the ship. I had turned twelve years 
old on the ship June fifth and June twelfth 
we came to the United States. June eleventh 
we landed in New 08:09  York, went through th
e DDT process and then got in New York 
and the first thing that Mother did, she saw 
a fruit stand, ran out and grabbed bananas. 
Had to get me some fruit because I had to ha
ve some fruit whether 
I wanted it or not, I 
had to eat it, and she coul dn't get over it, all th
e pl entiful things out in the street  that was 
available and then within twenty-four hours, 
two uncles of mi ne ca me , a great-uncle and 
my uncle. And I reme mb er seeing the first th
ing on him his white wing tip shoes. At a 
later time  I had to have a pair of white wing 
tip shoes. He picked us up, it was Uncle Ben 

and Uncle Alvin, my mo ther's brother and my
 mo ther's uncle and I reme mber we were 
still, troops were all over the pl ace, troops
 were comi ng home  in 1947, troop move me nts 
were full. We were on the train comi ng to Ri
chmond and a soldier was sitting there, my 
uncle went over to the soldier, says don't you 
see this little boy?  Move out of the way and 
let him lay down, he needs to lay down, have 
some  rest. And he ma de s oldier get up and 
give me  his seat. And then we came to Rich
mond and got picked up by my great-aunt or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359

Mother's aunt from Pepsi Cola, plus her si
ster. We  lived with her sister during the 
summer when we came during th
e summer. I of course didn'
t go to work, looked out on 
the porch and could see the ch
ildren playing underneath. My 
father's fi rst job was to 
clean restrooms in a service 
station. He couldn't speak the 
language, but he wasn't  going 
08:11  to be a burden to anybody 
or stay home either, so they
 got him a job and his first 
job was cleaning bathrooms in a service station 
and then he greased cars, before he went 

to work for my uncle. And eventually the kids out on the street ma naged to coax me  

down and I went down to start playing with th
em. I couldn't speak any English but I had a 
bicycle and pretty soon that bicycle became 
a me nder and they showed me how to ride  
the bicycle and we became  fr
iends and between June and 
September, I learned enough 
English to start school. I started school, because
 of my age, in the sixt h gr ade. I went  to 

school all year, I did good ma thematics, as 
I told you when I was 
cracking those lice, I 
could really count, but I coul
dn't do anything with spelling and I flunked, and I had to go 
from Lee's s c hool, which was the primary school
 to a Juni or High School, so because of 
my age again they sent me  to summer sc
hool. I went to summer school for the whole 
summer, at the end of the summer I went back
 to my original school, took a spelling test 
and spelled one word more than I spelled th
e previous time. So they passed me  and I 
went into Junior High School. Same  story 
in Junior High School. 
Every summer I took 
English in summer school. I could do good in
 literature, I did good in history, I just 
couldn't spell my way out of a paper bag, 
so every single summe r I spent in summer 
school. Then I got into high school and when
 I got into high school, when I turned 
eighteen I volunteered for the military during 
the Korean campaign. I wanted to pa y back 
what I had gotten. In the meanti me  my father
 had worked for -- left the service station 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
62 
 
and worked for my uncle as a mechanic. My mother worked as a seamstress for one of 
the department stores as well as she took in 
sewing at home, so that we could ma ke ends 
meet. And I 'll never forget, we have a thi
ng as United Jewish Appeal, people go around, 
collect money for the appeal, just like Unite
d Givers Fund, and then they help out other 
Jews, needy Jews. We  only had twenty do
llars when they came knocking on our door, 
asking for a donation, and Daddy said to Mother, 
give them five, and it's been all our life 
we've given just about in those percentages. 
She gave them the five dollars and then had 
to feed us for the rest of the week and take 
care of our needs on fifteen dollars, which had 

to have bus fare for him,  bus fare for her,
 lunches for us for the whole week until they 

would get paid again, and then after awhile
 my father and mother opened up a service 
station, against everybody's advice. Everybody to
ld them not to go into service station. 

The place that they ha d picked or could affo
rd with borrowed money was a rummy j oint. 
It was a nip joint during the 
war, where the guy wasn't  -- didn't  have much gas to sell 
anyhow, it was rationed so he used to sell 
bootleg whiskey, people used to come  out, buy 
by the shot, and he was, they were afraid
 of the reputation and Daddy said, never mi nd 
the reputation, it's all 
I can afford, it's all I can do. So Mo
ther established a kitchen in the 
back of the service station and from seven in
 the 08:15  morning, until
 eleven at night, it 
was the first 7-11 place, we were there, actually six. She used to pump gas , Daddy used 

to grease cars and inspect cars and after school 
I used to come  over there and grease cars 
and work and she used to ma ke our meals right
 there on the spot, all we did is go home to 
sleep at night and the next morning back again, and Daddy had ma naged to scrape 

enough money together to buy an old beat up car for a service car, he didn't  have money 

to buy the license, but one of the customers came  by to Daddy and said, give me  either 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
63 
 
five cents or twenty-five cents. Daddy said, 
for what?  He said, I'm 
going to invest it for 
you. We ll Daddy was afraid to lose a customer, 
we only had two, three customers, so he 
gave him the money. Couple of days later, 
the guy came back with
 eleven dollars. Daddy 
said, what's it for?  He says, you hit the numbers. So Daddy didn't know what it was all 
about, he didn't know numbers, when the guy had asked him for a number, Daddy gave 

him our telephone number from Eur ope, and that number hit, so he had money to buy 

license plates, and that's how we built the 
business, built it into a wholesale house. He 
became active in the Jewish community. 
He became active with B'nai B'rith, 
Anti-Defamation League , he's got awards from 
almost every facet of it, he became  active 

with the Jobber?  Association, 
and I was active with the mili
tary. I also became active in 
B'nai Brith. I became active in ORT. I was act
ive with the ma nufactur
ers of the military, I 
was active in my synagogue. We  have estab
lished a very good name  in the community, 
both 08:17  in the Gentile community and in
 the Jewish community. A couple of weeks 
ago I came up here with a busload of people fr
om the Confe r ence of Christians and Jews, 

I'm involved with that phase 
of it. I ended up as a Colonel in command of an aviation 
unit, and basically that's  it.  
 

Q: What do you think got you through all this?  Wh
at gave you the streng
th to get through all 
of this?  
 

A: Part of it in my particul
ar case is the drive to show 
people that I'm as good as anybody 
else. No ma tter what I do, I have to be 
as good or better than anybody else. I carry a 
tremendous load that I've created. I feel that 
I've got to prove that
 the Jew is as good or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
64 
 
better than every individual. He is a ma n of
 the book. Whether it was chosen or given or 
how it came about doesn't  ma tter, but education 
is vital, and no ma
tter what I'm involved 
in, if I can not do the very best, I try to stay
 away fr om it. I personally cannot afford to 
fail on a project, and I think th
at's what's driven us, and I've had good teachers. My 
parents have set an excellent exampl e. I've trie
d to live up to their imag
e, but also to stand 
on their shoulders as I wa nt my kids to stand on mi ne.  
 
Q: _________. 

 

A: It is to me .  

 

Q: How i mportant through all of th
is, has your religion been_______?   
 
A: I'm not a religious ma n. Other people think I'
m very religious. I feel
 that if I've gone 
through all that I have and all the close cal
ls, made by me  a nd not ma de  by me , and I 
survived, I must have been put
 here for a reason. That reason has to be a power greater 
than I. If there is such apower, it has to be God. I lead service in my synagogue every 
morning. I don't always eat kosher. I don't cons
ider myself a religious Jew. I consider 

myself a good Jew. I feel I have an obligation to
 pay, to the rest of Judaism and to the rest 
of the world, not just to the Jews, but to th
e non-Jewish community, to show them that we 

are all brothers, we all follow one God, no ma tte
r how you get there, if you want to get to 
the Wa shington Monument, there are three hund
red and sixty different roads you can take 
to the Wa shington Monume nt, but all of you will get there, if that is your goal. If you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
65 
 
believe  in one God, whether Jew, 08:21  Moslem, Hindu or what, we all will ge t there, 
and basically we'r e all brothers, we basicallyall come  out of Abraham, or  Ada m and if 
Ada m is the first man, we'r e still un
ited, so there's got to be a God.  
 

Q: Are there other things that
 you can think of, in terms of 
the way you live your life, that 
really stems from the experi
ences you had early on?  At l
east the first years you spent 
hiding and running in terror, it 
affected who you are today?   
 

A: I matured before my time. When I was nine I 
was an adult. At the tim
e of nine or ten I've 
experienced more than most people of twenty-f
ive or thirty. I picked up my street smarts 
by being out in the streets. I did not become  
a crook, I did not steal, but I picked up lots 
of s marts. I always was able to figure my wa
y out of a tight spot. Whether that's inherited 
or passed down or you pick it up, I don't know, but environme nt certainly teaches you a 
tremendous amount. You get a sixth sense. I'll 
give you an example of the  sixth sense. I 
was in Czechoslovakia on a fact finding mi ssi
on with UJA.  We were going through from 
the United St ates to Czechoslovakia, from
 Czechoslovakia to Teresienstadt, from 
Teresienstadt to Israel. Everybody -- my fr
iends from the United States and from 

Richmond t hat came with me on the same
 flight, everybody was 
just going shopping, 
having a good time, they didn't feel anything. 
I was walking down the street and I could 
feel the back of my neck, the hairs on the 
back of my neck rise. I felt I was followed, I 
was shadowed, I had -- nobody saw it, nobody felt it
, when I came back to the hotel that 
night I told them, I said we are being follo
wed, we'r e being watched, oh, you're i magining 
things. The next day we went to the syna
gogue and I speak very fluent Yiddish. I saw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
66 
 
some  of the local population, I started speakingto them in Yiddish. One of them says to 
me, talk softly, we got infiltrators right 
here in the synagogue that are watching you. I 
said, you're kidding me , he says no, he says, 
some of them understand Yiddish, some  of 
them are right there watching every move
 you make. He says, by the way, do you happen 
to have anything to read, did you bring anyt
hing, I said yeah, I 
brought the Jerusalem 
Post, he says oh, could I look at
 it, he said, if we could ge
t hold of some thing like that, 
every one of us would read it five time s be fore
 we would ever, we'd wea r  it out before we 
stopped reading it, I said sure, 
no problem. He sa ys but it's very dangerous for you to get 
it to me, I said don't worry about it, you will 
find it in your Tallith tomorrow. I went back 
to my room, I found out I was praying with him 
at his particular stander, which was that 
little stand that you had in fr
ont of you when you prayed. I put the newspaper in my coat 
pocket when I got the next day to pray. I stood 
up for Aleinu, for the prayer, slipped it out 
of my pocke t, slipped it into his Tallith, and 
when he left that day, he had the Jerusalem 
Post. And I knew, and I told everybody we were being watched and followed. They didn't 

feel it, but it's a sixth sense that you develop.  
 

Q: What about the impact of those early 
______on the way you've raised your children?   
 

A: I've been strict with my children and in 
some  cases it boomeranged. They, one of them is 
just now, at the age of thirty
 getting involved in Jewish activities. The other one says 
you're involved for all of us. They don't feel th
e involveme nt, they don't feel the pain that 
I feel. They don't feel they have the obliga
tion like I did, to reroot the tree and to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
67 
 
reestablish the roots and grow a new genera
tion like I do. That's some thing that I'm 
having a very difficult time copi
ng with. You never can tell.  
 
Q: I'm going to ask you one more question. Are 
there certain images 
that still haunt you, 
certain noises that bring it 
all back, cert
ain sights?   
 

A: You never ca n tell what will trigger whic
h me mory. Some of the me mories that I've 
talked to you about today were dormant for 
such a long time  that I even forgot they 
existed until I started thinking 
about them and started connecting them. I speak out on the 

Holocaust quite a bit and on the current world 
situation, that it can
 happen again, and the 
only defe nse is to keep pr essing the issue, th
at  it was an issue not only of the six million 

Jews, that it involved thirteen million people, no
t Jews, people, and that if the people that 
are related to the other si x, seven million don't do some thing about it, mo re millions are 
going to pay for it. So I speak out about it, but I don't speak out in as much detail as I 
spoke to you today, and when I start speaki
ng, there are a lot of 
things now that are 
connecting that have been dorma nt, so you ne
ver know which particular word or phase 
triggers a me mory that opens up another pa
ge that has been buried for years.  
 

Q: ______________ 

 

A: No, I think we've probably covered it quite 
well, we, I just me ntioned to you how that 
some  of the ingenious wa ys people tried to 
save some  of their things without turning 
them all over to the Germans and in my cas
e I have a pocket watch that my father, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0359  
68 
 
Manny, my grandfather who was a bootma ker, 
hollowed out the boot of my father's  
working boot and the pocket watch that my
 grandmother gave to my father on his 
wedding day was hidden throughout the Holocaust 
in that boot and that we ma naged to 
save and I have it. I've comple
tely restored it to working order and it's something I'll pass 
down to my kids.
