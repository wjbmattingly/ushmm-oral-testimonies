Q:  I'm going to start the interview, like fair
y tales do, at the very beginning.  So I'm 
going to  ask a few questions about your child
hood, your family lif

from there, and we'll explore all of those issues
 that relate to your experiences.  So the 
first question would be could yo

born and wh ere you were born?

Q:  In Bo ppard en Rhin e.  Can you tell me 
w h ere is Boppard in relation to some of the 
larger cities in the area?

A:  All right.  It's a little bit south

Q:  South of Koblenz?

put it in.  I told her to put it. 
 It's a beautiful -- No

Q:  It's a very nice part of Germany.    
                        
 
A:  Hmm?                          
                
               
 
Q:  It's a very nice part of Germany.    
                        
 
A:  Oh, it's gorgeous.  It's a tour
ist town actually.            
 
Q:  Was it really?  Boppard was a touris

A:  Yeah.

A:  And we used to have -- every summer we
 used to have the relatives and people 
coming; they stayed with us, and we'd  take
 them on the Rhin e.  And we had a swimming 
pool, like a wooden thing floating on th e Rhin
e with two pools, on e deep and one for 
learning that --                     
                            
 
Q:  On the river itself?              
              
             
 
A:  Yeah, on the river itself.  And my parent
s taught the two of -- my sister and me how 
to swim.  And when  we could swim, we could go into  the deep end. 
                   
                  
 
Q:  It sounds lovely, you know?         
                         
 
A:  It was.              
                    
                    
 
Q:  Your sister, was she younger than you?
                       
 
A:  No, two and a half years older.      
                        
 
Q:  Two and a half.  What was her name?   
                       
 
A:  Claire -- Claire Edith Loeb, and then 
afterward she married and became Mahla (ph).   
                       
Q:  Mahla.  And she was born then in 1923? 
                      
 
A:  Yes

Q:  December 23rd.  And while 
we're at it, we'd  like to get 
also your mother's and your 
father's  names and dates of birth, if you rememb
er the dates of birth.             
                        
 
A:  Oh, yes, sure.  I've got it written do
wn.                    
 
Q:  But we'll get it for the tape as well. 
                      
 
A:  Oh, yeah.                       
               
              
 
Q:  So your father's name was?
                  
                 
 
A:  Was Rudolf Loeb.

A:  -- Leyser, L-e-y-s-e-r, Loeb.  And she wa
s born in Dusseldorf, and her date of birth 
was October 31st, 1891.        
 
Q:  Your father, it sounds like he had ch
ildren rather late in life for a -- for -- 
                     
                     
A:  Yes.  Oh, yes.                  
               
              
 
Q:  Was there a reason for why this 
happened because --          
 
A:  No, because they 
got married late, I guess.  They 
got married in 1
922, and '23 my 
sister was born, '26 I was born. Didn't waste a
ny time.                    
                       
 
Q:  {Laughing.}  Tell me a l ittle bit about 
your mother and the family that she came

others and sisters?               
                        
 
A:  She had some brothers and sisters.  
She had -- let's see -- one sister who was our 
favorite aunt.  We loved her.  Her name was 
Lisa, Liza.  She wasn't
 married.  Then she 
had twin s, Martha and -- I don't know wh at th
e other one.  And th en she had an older 
sister, Julia.                                            
 
Q:  So she came from a 
family of girls?         
                 
 
A:  And one brother, Otto.             
                          
 
Q:  He was overw helmed and outnumbered.   
                       
 
A:  Yeah.  Yeah.                    
               
              
 

Q:  And your grandparents' f amily , did you

A:  They were all dead by the time -- I was n amed afte
r all my grandmothers.                
              
             
Q:  Ah, I see.  So you never got to kno
w them?                   
 
A:  They were dead when I came along.    
                        
 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah.                    
               
              
 
A:  I mean, most of my cousins would 
-- when I was little, I 
was sitting on their 
shoulders.  Some of them were married already.  
 
Q:  So your mo ther mu st have been  the youngest
 of the family or close to it.  Is that so? 
                          
A:  What do you mean?                
                            
 
Q:  I mean, in her family when sh

A:  Yes, the same thing, all my cousins -- I 
have one cousin left; she's in her '9 0s; she's 
sort of -- she's in England, sort of
 out of it.  And all the rest of th
em are all dead.            
 
Q:  What kind of -- Did your mother come
 from a well-to-do family or a struggling 
family?  How would you de
scribe it?       
 
A:  No, they were -- they were well off.  
                       
 
Q:  Do you know the business 
that her --                         
 
A:  No, I don't know th e business they we

Q:  Okay.  What about your father and --  
                       
 
A:  My father -- His father started the busi
ness in Boppard. And th
en when  he died, my  
father took over.                      
 
Q:  What was the business?             
                          
 
A:  Grain and feed business.           
                          
 
Q:  Oh.  So was it an agricultural area?  
                       
 
A:  No.  It was a small town, and ther
e weren't too many Jews. Well, you knew 
everybody.  I mean -- and, no,
 we had one congreg ation, a
nd it wasn't kosher.  I mean, 
there was no way.   
 
Q:  Were your family very religious?     
                        
 

A:  My father was on the board of -- of the s
hul.  But, I mean, we weren't -- we kept the 
High Ho lidays, but we weren't too religious
, you know.  I mean, like on Pu rim and some 
of these holidays, he'd  work and what
-have-you.  We didn't have a kosher home.        
               
               
Q:  Did -- Was there a -- You said there weren 't too ma
ny Jews in Boppard?                 
                           
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  Was it -- Could you give me a sens
e of the numbers?  Would it have been --         
               
               
A:  I don't know.  You know, I left when I 
was 10 years old. All I know is we had -- we 
had a Hebrew school, and all the kids were in
 one room, the big kids in the back and the 
little kids like me in the front row.  They  were -- There were four rows, so you can 
imagine how many families --  
                           
 
Q:  Not many.                       
               
              
 
A:  Not many.                       
               
              
 
Q:  Not many.  And if it was a two-room schoolhouse --           
 
A:  And -- No, it was -- it was upstairs where 
the synagogue room was.  Synagogue was 
down stairs, and upstairs was -- And, I mean
, there may be -- have been some people 
where the kids were out grown already or they
 didn't have any children.  As I say, I was 
10 years old; my  parents knew everybody, but 
I didn't know -- I knew everybody in to wn  
sort of, but I didn't know  their, you know, past and wh at
-have-you.           
              
 
Q:  Were you -- If you went to a Jewish sc
hool, a Hebrew  school
,  did you have any 
interaction as a child with -- with not
 -- with Gentiles, with Germ
ans?                    
                      
 
A:  All my friends because I went to a Cath -- in B
oppard was a small town.                 
                            
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And there was one like a public school, we
nt to eighth grad e, and then th ere was a 
Catholic school with th e nuns which went 
all the way 12 -- you know?           
                      
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And that 's where my sister and I went, 
and then there was a boys' school that was like 
this Catholic school but only fo r 
boys.  So  we went to this -- my  sister and I went to this 
Catholic school.                     
                            
 
Q:  Well, that's unusual that Jewish parents wo
uld send a child to a Catholic school --     
                         
A:  It was the only better school there.  
                       
 
Q:  Better than the public school?       
                        
 

A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  I see.  Do you have a
ny memories of it?       
               
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.               
                            
 
Q:  And what kind were they?  Anything 
stand out?                
 
A:  Oh, in kindergarten  I loved to play w
ith the boys.  And I remember the nuns were 
very nice.  When they went 
to services, you know, they wo
uldn't leave us alone -- I was 
little, four, five years old -- in the school rooms.
  So we had to go w
ith them to service, 
but they said, "Don't  get up, don 't kneel."  I 
mean, they were very 
decent.  You know, in 
those days people didn't wear pants.  The kids
 didn't wear pants, and we'd  go -- like we'd  
have a break, we'd  play outside.  We'd  go up on the stairs, and I rememb er two and two 
holding hands going upstairs a
nd this nun coming in the back of us, and she would call 
my  mo ther and say, "You got to
 do something, her skirts are too short.  We can see her 
panties."                                 
 
Q:  Oh.                           
                               
 
A:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
Q:  Did you have any best
 friends in the classroom?              
 
A:  Yes, I had some -- I had some good
 friends there.            
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  But a lot of the -- in fact, one of them
 -- some of them came from out of town, and 
one of them used -- came from o u t of town, 
and she would come to my  house every day 
for lunch.  And so you know -- and I don't 
know what happened to  them.  I mean, either 
they're all too or they 'r e gone; I don't know 
what happened to th em during the war.  But 
there were these -- I played with
 them until I left Germany.  In fact, I've got like a -- what 
they call a poussy (ph) album, you know, where 
they write things, and they all wrote nice 
memo ries and nice things 
in that book when I 
-- before I left.  They knew I was leaving.  
 
Q:  Well, here's the interesting thing is th
at your beginning school 
years if you were born 
in 1926, I 'm assuming you must have starte
d school, kinderg arten 1931, 1932, something 
like that.  Would that be true?            
                           
 
A:  Nineteen -- yeah.                 
              
             
 
Q:  Yeah?  And in 1933, H
itler comes to power.                   
 
A:  1933.                          
               
               
 

Q:  Yeah.  So in your world,
 you know, your child's world 
in Bo ppard, did you sense any 
of these political things that were in the air?  
                          
                          
 
A:  Well, after 1933, for instance, in school, 
we all played -- the kids
 would play with me, 
and they were very nice.  But they couldn't in
vite me to their houses for birthday parties 
or to come and play.  They  couldn't come 
to my  house to come 
and play and what-have-
you, you know.  And they'd  heard -- so I got 
friendly with a couple of Jewish kids who 
didn't  go to that school and -- but they were 
killed afterwards; they 
were -- they went to 
Auschwitz, their whole families.     
                    
 
Q:  Were deported?                   
                            
 
A:  They were deported.               
                           
 
Q:  So well, the change was is that you coul
dn't socialize -- within the school you were 
allowed to socialize --  
             
 
A:  Yeah, until 1936, and then my parents got 
a -- got a phone call that they should -- that 
we couldn't  go to school there anymore, it 
wouldn't  be safe.              
                      
 
Q:  I see.  S o  the nuns called.  I mean, the Catho
lic school called and said that --           
                            
A:  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  They 
warned my parents.           
 
Q:  And -- But I'm trying to get a sense that until 1936, was this like 
a -- a kind of oasis in 
this -- in the changing world?
 I mean, did you feel any -- 
any of th e -- In public schools 
sometimes, teachers became very hostile to 
--                    
 
A:  Right.                         
               
               
 
Q:  -- Jewish students --              
                          
 
A:  Right.                         
               
               
 
Q:  -- because of the political changes.   
                      
 
A:  Right.                         
               
               
 
Q:  I wondered whether or not there was mo re leeway within a non
public school such  as 
a religious school and whether they were able
 to create a wall betw
een the outside world 
or wh ether or not the same thing happened --     
                           
 
A:  No, the nuns were very nice to us.   
                        
 
Q:  They were?            
                    
                   
 
A:  Oh, yes, oh, yes, they were very nice.  
And, as I say, in school we kids all played 
together.  But it was on the outside where I 
could not be seen with them.       
                      
 

Q:  That hurts a child.               
              
             
 
A:  And things like I remember
 a friend of my parents, he 
was a lawyer, and th ey had a 
parade one day down Main Street -- we lived
 on the main street.  And he looked out the 
window, and they arrested him for looking out the window an
d watching the parade, that 
sort of thing, you know.  And -- But I didn'
t know -- at the time I didn't know about it.  
My parents told me after I came here.   
                                            
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.  Of incidents like that?     
                        
 
A:  That what happened to this man, y
ou know.                    
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  That sort of thing.              
                            
 
Q:  What was your home life like?  Tell me a 
little bit about that.              
                       
                       
 
A:  Oh, very happy.  My moth
er was sort of a quiet lady.  
But, I mean, she was -- she was 
a beautiful pianist, and she wo
uld make my  sister and me  s
it on the carpet and listen to 
her play.  And my father had a wonderful sense of humor.  I was always getting  into 
trouble.  My sister was read
ing books, and she was sitting,
 and she was the good girl.  
And I was always getting Œ like, for instan
ce, the office of where we lived was 
down stairs, the build ing -- the business 
--                   
                   
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  -- and we lived upstairs.           
                         
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And I would so metimes lock the door of 
the office, and my  father would have to get 
somebody to  climb out the window, come around
.  They knew exactly who did it.     
                      
 
Q:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
A:  That sort of thing.              
                            
 
Q:  {Laughing.}  But sometimes t h e 
mischie v ous children --       
 
A:  But then my -- then my fa
ther would co me out, and he'd  give me  a wallop on my  back  
side, and then half an hour later, I'd be
 sitting on his knee, a
nd he would be kidding 
around.             
 
Q:  So tell me a little bit about hi
s personality, about what kind of a pers
on he was.              
                   
A:  He was -- Well, I can only say when I 
rememb er him, he was always good-natured 
and very fair.  I mean, 
he would never punish me because I was little wild thing.  And my 

sister was always good sitting there, reading her 
books and so on, so fo
rth.  But I mean, in 
school, we both did well, and that was importa
nt to them, you know.  But no, he had a 
wonderful sense of humo r, and we would go -- 
they wo uld -- it was a beautiful area, and 
we'd  do a lot of hiking.  And, as I said befo
re, in the summer we'd  have a lot of family 
coming and people coming staying with us be
cause it was sit -- on the Rh ine and th e    
beautiful walks and -- and, you know, you go
 up on -- into the h
illside part, and on top 
there would be a restaurant overlo
oking the Rhine and stuff, and we'd
 go there --            
 
Q:  Oh, that must be pretty.           
                          
 
A:  -- and take them there on Su ndays and so 
on, so forth.  We took the children there, 
my  granddaughters and my  kids there to show them where we were bor
n.                  
                  
 
Q:  Was there any trace of your family fro
m when you went afte
r the war back to 
Boppard with your children?    
                  
 
A:  Well, most of them got out of Germany.  
Some of them went to 
-- some -- As a matter 
of fact, some of my father's  sisters had come here at th
e end of the 18th century --                  
 
Q:  19th century.                    
                            
 
A:  -- to New York.  No, 1891, 19t
h century .  No, 18th  century.  
 
Q:  No, no, no.  19th century
 but in 1891.                       
 
A:  But in 1891, yeah.                
              
             
 
Q:  It gets confusing, yeah.  
                  
                 
 
A:  And it was only actually two.  One went -- 
one where the family -- 
the one that wasn't  
married went to Holland; she was killed.  An
d then my father ha
d one brother who was 
married, had no children, and they didn't get out; they got killed.  
That was the only one 
that get didn't out.           
                     
 
Q:  So the -- he had, if I take it correctly, one  brother and three sister
s, that is, one in the 
Netherlands who didn't make it, o n e in --                
                  
                  
 
A:  That was my mother's sister --      
                         
 
Q:  Oh, excuse me.         
                   
                   
 
A:  -- in the Netherlands.             
                          
 
Q:  I see.               
                                       
 
A:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 

Q:  So tell me about your father's  siblings. 
 How many did he have so that we're clear on 
it?                 
                 
 
A:  He had I think th ree or f
our brothers.  See, some of 
them were liv ing out -- in the 
United States already, so by the time I came 
along, they weren't even there anymore.  
They were dead and --            
                        
                       
 
Q:  Were they mostly older than he was?  
                        
 
A:  He was the youngest.              
                           
 
Q:  Ah, yeah, so if he was born in 1877 
--                       
 
A.  Some were born in  the 19 -- in the 1840's and '5 0's. 
 He was born --             
                    
                    
Q:  Oh, my.                        
               
               
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it could very
 easily be that they --      
 
A:  Oh, sure.  No, he was the youngest of 
the whole.  And my  mo th er too on her side 
there.                 
                   
 
Q:  Did -- Did your -- Did his family live in
 Boppard  for generations
, or had they -- had 
your grandfather come to it from someplace else? 
                         
                        
 
A:  No, the grandfather was born there too.
                      
 
Q:  Okay.  So it was -- it was in th
e family for a while?        
 
A:  There was what they called a Judenga
sse.                     
 
Q:  Ah, a street that would be the Jewi
sh street?                
 
A:  The Jews lived there.             
                           
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  And that's where they were born.  An
d then  my  gran dfather bought the building on 
the Main Street and -- after they were allowe
d to, I guess -- I don't know what year that 
was -- and he started the business, and he moved 
upstairs.                     
 
Q:  And that's where you were born?      
                        
 
A:  And that's where I was born.        
                         
 
Q:  Tell me a little bit ab
out the apartment, then, upstair
s that -- above that building?        
                       

A:  Well, we had -- let's see.  We had 
-- well, a kitchen and -- and on -- on -- well, 
down stairs was all office and, of course, unde
r -- in those days the refrigerator was under 
the stairs.  I don't know if you ev er
 heard of that.          
                  
 
Q:  No.  No.                       
               
               
 
A:  No, you know, th e stairs.  And the refrige
rator wasn't in the kitchen; it was under the 
stairs.             
               
 
Q:  Because it's the co olest place?  Is
 that why?                
 
A:  No.  I guess there was no -- there was 
no space in the kitchen for it.      
                      
                      
 
Q:  Uh-huh.                        
               
               
 
A:  And -- And I used to throw the key from th
e door under there.                         
                 
                 
 
Q:  Oh, that's mean.        
                   
                  
 
A:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
Q:  Because it's hard to get to.        
                         
 
A:  I know.  Well, they had long arms
, they got  --              
 
Q:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
A:  Somehow they got them.    
                  
                 
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  No, I mean, it was normal, like a two-stor
y house here, and upstairs we had one, two, 
three bedrooms.  And th ere was a -- a big room which was our playroom wh ere we used 
to play and where we -- our friends used to
 come, where we had ou
r toys.  And we had a 
maid, and I remember on Christmas on the -- on 
the table there, my mother would have a 
little Christmas tree with all kind of gifts.  No
, we had a maid for a 
long time.  And then 
in 1933, I think it was, we weren't allowed to have
 any maids under 60 years old.           
                          
Q:  So 60, 6-0, and older c
ould still work as maids but nobody else?       
                          
                         
A:  Right.  And so we had to let that one 
who'd worked for us -- Ma
ria who worked for us 
forever and we knew her whole 
family, I mean, she was wond
erful, and we loved her.  
And we got this old maid, and 
we hated her.                  
                        
 
Q:  Oh.                           
                               
 
A:  And so we let her go, so my mo
ther did her own th ing.        
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.  What was the name of the maid that you loved?       
 

A.  Maria.               
                    
                    
 
Q:  Maria?                         
               
               
 
A:  Mm-hmm               
                                       
 
Q:  And was she from in town too, from 
Boppard?                  
 
A:  No, no.  There was behind -- Bo ppard was 
down by the Rhine, 
and then there was -- 
it went uphill, in other words like -- 
like the grape --            
                                   
 
Q:  The vineyards?                   
                            
 
A:  The vineyards.                   
                            
 
Q:  Vineyards.                      
               
              
 
A:  Vineyards.                      
               
              
 
Q:  Yes.                          
                               
 
A:  And then  on top there was called Huns
ruck.                   
 
Q:  Uh-huh.  I've heard of Hunsruck.     
                        
 
A:  You have?             
                    
                   
 
Q:  Yeah, It's a small place, but I've 
heard of it.              
 
A.  No, it's not a town.  It's a whole ar
ea.                     
 
Q:  Ah --                          
               
               
 
A.  And there were farms up there.       
                        
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And her parents were farmers, and sh
e had a brother.  And somehow -- I don't know 
how my  parents got her because she was there 
as long as I could rememb er, and she came 
from one of the families there.  And every 
once in a while, she -- I remember sh e would 
take us kids up there to her family.  She ha
d a brother who had a -- had a mo torcycle, and 
I remember going on that moto
rcycle; it was the most exciting thing in those days.   
 
Q:  Of course.  Of course.   
                                   
 
A:  And even after she had to leave, every 
once in a while she'd cr
awl in in the evening 
and bring my mother some st
uff from the farm, so
me foods and stuff.  And no, she was 
very nice.  She died.  I m
ean, she -- so --        
                              
 
Q:  But not during the war?            
                          
 

A:  No, it had nothing to do with
 the war.  She wasn 't Jewish, you know.                
                  
                 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it sounds like the -- 
the experiences that you had with people who 
weren't Jew ish, just regular everyday German people
 --                        
                         
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  -- were for the most part quite 
positive and --              
 
A:  Very positive.  I mean, we -- my parent
s, of course, knew everybody in town.  And I 
knew a lot of the people, and I -- my  proble
m was like, for instan
ce, my sister had a 
bicycle, and in 1935 my sister  --  my parent
s sent her to a yavneh in Cologne.    
 
Q:  Hmm.                          
                
               
 
A:  And so her bicycle was at home.  I wasn't
 allowed to use it, but I used to crawl out 
with it, and I would fall off it, and somebody 
would see me and call my mother before -- 
and I would go home, and yo
u know what I got.            
                    
 
Q:  Yeah.  In trouble.               
                            
 
A:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
Q:  Where did your sister go in 
Co logne, a yavneh, you said?     
 
A:  A school, it's a Jewish school.      
                        
 
Q:  A Jewish school --                
                           
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  -- for high school children or --      
                      
 
A:  Yeah.  It was a -- It was for -- yeah, fo
r high school.  She was already in th e upper, 
you know.             
                 
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.  But that's quite far from Boppa
rd , isn't it, Cologne?             
                      
                      
 
A:  Not that far.  I mean, take the train up there, you know.    
 
Q:  So she would co mmu te, or did she 
stay overnight?             
 
A:  Oh, no, she -- she stayed
 overnight.                         
 
Q:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  How -- If you can re
memb er, and if your parents told you later, 
how were their lives affected after 1933?      
                           
              
             
 
A:  Well, one of their neighbors who wasn't
 Jewish came over one night and told my  
father -- this -- this was after I had left Ge
rmany -- "You better get out of here.  I heard 
rumo rs. Something's going to happen to
 you."  So -- So  th ey bought our ho
use --                  
                   

Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  -- and my  parents moved 
to  Co logne where they weren't known, had an ap artment 
there until they emigrated.    
                 
 
Q:  Ah, I see.  So this -- was this a fam
ily friend, or was this just --  
                           
                          
   
 
A:  Yeah, well, you know, they were all wh
at they call on the  "du" level.     
                      
                      
Q:  Yeah, the familiarity level.        
                         
 
A:  Yeah.  I mean, they lived  there forever, and my parent
s lived there forever, and we 
used to go in  and out of their house, and 
they used to come to us.        
                      
 
Q:  But did you ever see a
ny Nazis, I mean, people with  -- who belo nged to th e Nazi 
party or --              
                   
 
A:  Oh, definitely.  I had a girlfriend next 
door; she was about a year older.  The parents 
had a jewelry store, and she used to  -- you 
know, she used to come
 to our house, and I 
used to go to their house and 
what-have-you.  And her brot
her was a little bit older, and 
he belonged  to the youth -- the German youth group.  
                             
                            
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  And when he wasn't home, she would c
limb over the back fence into our garden, and 
we would play togeth er.  Bu
t God forbid us if he was 
home, we wouldn't  be seen 
together.                    
 
Q:  So --                          
                              
 
A:  No, all the young kids had to 
go into this youth thing, you know.      
                         
                         
Q:  The Hitler Jugend?                
                           
 
A:  Hmm?                          
                
               
 
Q:  The Hitler Jugend?                
                           
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  And -- And aside from that, before you left
 Germany, did you sense that your father's  
business was suffering in -- at any way?                     
                    
                    
 
A:  Look, I wasn't 10 years old.
  I knew nothing about business. 
 
Q:  Got it.                        
               
               
 
A:  As long as I had something to eat.    
                       
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 

A:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
Q:  Okay.  So it sounds like if 
the re were such things that yo
ur parents kind of shielded 
you from those -- from the nastier parts?       
                          
                          
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  But we knew that we 
had to be very careful.  We knew th at outside 
of the school we couldn't talk to these ki
ds that I would play with  in the school, you 
know.  We knew, and we were very upset a
bout it.  But, you know, all of a sudden, 
they're having a birthday part
y and you're not invited.  
 
Q:  That hurts a child.  That hurts a 
child, yeah.               
 
A:  Sure.  So on.  But -- As I say, then I made
 friends with a couple of kids that were in 
my  Hebrew school, and everything was within  
walking distance, so it wasn't a matter of 
catching the bus to get to their house or -- 
or somebody driving -- getting into th e car and 
driving.  You ju st walked
 wherever you went.    
 
Q:  Well, in the Hebrew school, what are the 
things that you've studied?  And then I have 
another follow-up question after that. 
 
A:  Oh, I don't remember.  I remember lear
ning how to read Hebrew
.  We studied -- Oh, 
God, I don't know, it's so long ago. All I 
rememb er, one day one of
 the friends, her name 
was Ella, she was like this.       
                                       
 
Q:  She was large?          
                   
                  
 
A:  And she was fat, and sh e used to eat ca
ndy all the time. And so the rabbi who was our 
teacher too, he caught her and took  it and put
 it in his desk drawer.  And when there was 
a break, the kids said, "Hilde, go and get it ba
ck for her.  We're not 
going to tell anybody.  
We're not going to tell him.  We'r e not going 
to  do anything."  Well, he comes back, the 
first thing he opens the door, okay, who to
ok it?  Everybody looked at me.      
 
Q:  {Laughing.}                      
                            
 
A:  They  didn't say who, but they looked at
 me.  So I had -- I had to write a hundred 
times "Wer hailt (ph) der stiehlt."  It means w ho steals 
-- who lies -- he who lies steals.
              
 
Q:  Say it in German for me again.      
                         
 
A:  "Wer hailt der stiehlt."            
                         
 
Q:  "Wer hailt"?                     
                            
 
A:  "Der stiehlt."                   
                            
 
Q:  So hailen (ph) means to lie?        
                         
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 

Q:  Uh-h uh,  I thought lugen meant to lie. 
                      
 
A:  Well, it's probably a local word  of some
 sort.  Anyhow, by th
e time I got home, my  
sister'd already gotten there.           
 
{Laughing.}  And I had to sit down  and write 
a hundred  times.  I got no protection.  I had 
to sit down and write it a hundred  tim
es.  {Laughing.}                   
                           
 
Q:  And all because you wanted to
 have Ella have
 her candy back. 
 
A:  Yeah.  {Laughing.}                
                           
 
Q:  Did life -- in the school itself, di
d you go to that school until the time 
you left?                
                   
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  So did th ings change th
ere?  Did people tell stories 
there of wh at was going on with 
their families, with th
emselves?       
 
A:  No.  There weren 't many Jewish kids.  
There was only -- one of my  parents' friends, 
they -- their two daughters were there. And th
en one other boy -- one other girl was there, 

and then  we were the only Jewish children ther
e, and the others were all older than I was 
anyhow.                   
                      
 
Q:  Because it was a small commun -- 
small congregation?         
 
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  Yeah.  So tell me, is there anything else
 from your prewar lif
e and your pre-leaving 
Germany life, I should say, that -- that -- th
at stays -- you know, co mes to mind that stays 
with you that is something th
at -- that shaped --      
               
 
A:  Yeah.  Well, always to me was importa
nt going swimming in 
the summer.  I mean, 
my  parents always took us swimming every 
day.  We could walk  down  alone.  You 
know, you'd have your bathing suit on and a 
cover on, and you'd  just walk because you 
walked ev erywhere.  And my  sister and I woul
d walk  down  after school or the hikes we 
took together and -- and then the company we 
used to have in the summer, and we took 
them on hikes and to  these restaurants wher
e you could oversee the Rhine and the ships 
coming and everything.              
                       
 
Q:  That sounds beautiful.             
                          
 
A:  And, you know, you could take -- you know
, there were the cruises on the Rhin e, and 
they would stop, and you'd go into the castle
s and all that kind of stuff.        
                      
 
Q:  Sounds very pretty.               
                           
 
A:  Oh, yeah, it was nice.             
                          
 

Q:  So how did it come about 
that in 1936 you leave Boppard
, that you leave Germany?  
What developed?         
                
 
A:  Well, first of all, I couldn'
t go to school anymore there.   
 
Q:  To the Catholic school?            
                          
 
A:  Yeah, to any school.              
                           
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And my -- my mother was friendly with
 the wife of the rabbi in Dusseldorf who 
married my  parents.         
                   
 
Q:  Ah.                           
                               
 
A:  And she had a sister who lived -- I don'
t know if you ever heard of the In ter-Aid 
Committee in London, they he
lped children get out.                        
                 
                
 
Q:  Was this the Kindertransport, then?   
                       
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  No?                           
                               
 
A:  No.  I had nothing to do 
with it.  And they -- And this lady -- I didn't even know her -- 
called her sister, the rabbi's wife, if she 
knew anybody, she heard of this fami ly who 
wanted to  take three 10-year-old  girls out of 
Germany.  And so this rabbi's wife -- I don't 
know even know her 
name.  No, I know her second 
name, _______, she called my  
mother.  And I mean, she knew us girls.    
                        
                       
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And would she be interested.  And so my  
mother yes, but what -- she wanted to know 
more about the family, you know.  And an
yhow, comes August -- 
August 16th, my -- 
took the train -- my parents.  My mother was going to go with me.  She went with me,   
took me just to make sure.            
                           
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And my father went as far as Cologn
e.  One thing I will ne
ver ever forget him 
standing there, the first time I ever saw 
him, the tears running down his eyes -- his 
cheeks.  Well, he didn't know whether he'd  
ever see me again because he didn't  know 
what would happen to  them, you know?   
                     
 
Q:  That's  right.                    
                            
 

A:  S o  my  mo th er to ok  me to
 England, and there was this lady that her name was Jessie 
Wait (ph).  And she took -- And the people that
 actually had us come over, they lived -- 
had a big estate in the countr
y, and they owned this house 
in Nottingham so that we could 
walk to school, to a priv ate school.  And th is
 lady, Jessie Wait took care of us.  I mean, 
she was very strict, but she was very good, 
very fair.  And -- And so my mother went 
back and --              
                    
                    
 
Q:  She -- Yeah, so she was able to 
see where you'd be?          
 
A:  See where I was going.  And I remembered
, you know, they had an
 extra bedroom, so 
she slept there.  And the next morning, I got 
up out of my  bed and went to that room to 
see here, and she'd left alrea
dy because they figured  I'd be 
too upset -- both be too upset, 
you know.  So she to ok the train 
back to London alre
ady.  So -- So I cried a little bit, and 
that was it, you know.  There were two -- the 
other two girls had come a few days earlier.  
And, no, we went to private school.  We ha
d piano lessons; we had 
dancing lessons.  We 
had -- wh at do you call it -- speech lessons, Eng
lish sp eech lessons, all private stuff, you 
know.  And we had a piano; I mean, ther
e was nothing -- nice garden .  And on the 
Sundays in the 
spring and su mmer -- the people that got
 me over there, they had a cricket 
team.          
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  So in  the summer they would have a cr
icket match in their park, they could -- you 
know, which was around th eir building, their hom
e.  And then they had this huge tent, 
and co mes lunch time, we'd  all si
t together with these fellows.                  
 
Q:  Cricket players?                 
                            
 
A:  They came from N ew Zealand, from India 
because they -- these cricket teams, they 
traveled all over, you know.  And we'd  have l
unch with  them.  And those things you don't 
forget.  And they had a beautiful swimming po
ol.  They would pick
 us up on the Sunday 
morning, they 'd  send a chauffeur
 with -- and the car and pick 
us up, the three girls, and 
we'd  go out there.  We'd  have a wo nderful time.
                         
                         
 
Q:  Was this termed in any 
way?  Did this -- Was this an
 open-ended kind of invitation 
that you stayed there as long as you need to , or 
was it for two years, or was it for a year?      
 
A:  No, no.  It was, I g u ess,
 open-ended.  I mean, when  the war started in 1939 over there, 
the -- the other two, their parents had co me to
 England, one in Lond
on, the other one in 
Glasgow in Scotland, and so  they
 went to live with their parent
s.  So the people sent me 
to a boarding school.          
                   
 
Q:  Oh, I see.  So --                
                            
 
A:  Out in the country.               
                           
 

Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And there -- And the principals of both sc
hools were absolu tely fabulous.  Like on the 
-- what's it?  In November 8th -- the 18th
 of November?               
                      
 
Q:  Armistice Day?                   
                            
 
A:  No, in 1938.           
                   
                   
 
Q:  Oh, Kristallnacht.                
              
             
 
A:  Kristallnacht.  On the 
Friday s we always had to read
 the Times, the London Times, 
and they  gave us exercises to
 do, you know, ques
tions and what-h ave-you.  And I read 
about it, and I burst into tears, and the -- a
nd they called the principal in, and she took me, 
and she let me sit in her office
 all day to quieten me down and so on.  And in  the -- in the 
board ing school, the principal used to, you 
know, call me in, and I remember g etting a 
letter from -- my parents got out in '41.     
 
Q:  That's  quite late.                
              
             
 
A:  And -- And went to Spain; they were able to get into Spain. They had to pay 
somebody off in Berlin, they ha
d to go to Berlin, and they 
flew to Barcelona.  And so 
evidently the principal saw that there was a le
tter for me from Spain, 
and she came in to -
- We were having breakfast.  She said, "Usua
lly at lunch time you get your mail, but I've 
got to make an exception. Hild
e, come to my office."  
So I wondered  wh at's going on 
now? By  that time I was, wh
at, about 15 years old.  And 
here was a letter from my  
mother -- from my parents in Barcelona that th
ey'd  gotten out, you k
now.  But they had to 
wait there for a ship.  There wa
s no su ch thing getting on th e pl
ane.  They had to wait for 
a ship to take them over here.   
                    
 
Q:  Tell me, what happened to
 your sister?                       
 
A:  My sister came here -- she went in 1939,
 she -- her school had 
a whole group of kids 
they sent to England.  And she went and lived with a very
, very nice Quaker family.   
               
 
Q:  So was she part of the Kindertranspor
t?                      
 
A:  No, no, from her school where 
she went, from the yavneh.     
 
Q:  Uh-huh.                        
               
               
 
A:  They had a group of kids, and they -- yo
u know, they were able to get them into 
England.  And she stayed in 
Bristol with a family and help
ed take care of the children 
there, and they were very, very
 good to her, very nice.  Bu
t she came over then; a couple 
of years later she came over.  She came before 
me.  And  she lived w
ith a cousin until my 
parents came.                   
 

Q:  Okay, now I'm a little c
onfused .  When  you say sh e came a few years before you, you 
mean to the United States
?             
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  Okay.  I'm still --      
                                   
 
A:  I'm sorry.                      
               
              
 
Q:  That's  okay.                    
               
              
 
A:  I'm sorry.                      
               
              
 
Q:  That's  all right.                 
              
             
 
A:  I should have said --              
                          
 
Q:  It's okay.                      
               
              
 
A:  No, because I came in '44, a
nd she came in  '41 -- '40, '41.  
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  No, she went to England in '38.  I'm 
lying, '39, not '39, '38.  So --      
                                               
 
Q:  Did you meet her soon after she cam
e to England?             
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Because you hadn't seen her for a 
couple of years?           
 
A:  I know.  No.  I went there one summer va
cation; I went and stayed with them for a 
couple of weeks, you know.  And -- But, of 
course, they didn't  have the long vacations 
they have here in the summer.   
                          
                         
 
Q:  No.                           
                               
 
A:  So -- and I went -- I went down to Bris
tol and -- for a couple 
of weeks.  And then 
soon after, she came here, you know. And she wa
s going to school, and she took care of 
those -- helped take care of the children ther
e and helped in the house and wh at-have-you.
                       
Q:  Now, wh en she came and you were able
 to meet her that summe r, did she tell you of 
what was going on in Germany and what
 had gone on with the fam
ily since you left?                 
 
A:  No, not really, because I 
had read that in the Times --
 in the -- in the London Times 
on that Friday.                       
 
Q:  About Kristallnacht?               
                          
 

A:  About Kristallnacht.  Bu
t then  somehow, I don't know, we were kids, we were just 
trying to  have a good time together, you know.     
                            
                           
 
Q:  Okay.  You didn 't talk about th
e hard things, the --         
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  -- the tough things?               
                          
 
A:  No, no, no, no, no.  
                                       
 
Q:  Yeah.  How frequently did 
you write -- Were you able to 
write to your parents during 
those years?                        
 
A:  For a while I was able to write.  I had 
a relative in Holland and sent them -- and my 
parents sent them letter, and they  would fo
rward it.  But then when the Germans came 
into Holland, that was the end of
 that so --          
                
 
Q:  I see.  But that would have been afte
r the war started , correct?                      
                  
                 
 
A:  Yeah.  Well, right after the war star
ted.                    
 
Q:  Yeah.  So for three years you were able 
to correspond with them
 in this fashion of 
having --               
                 
 
A:  Any fashion --                   
                            
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  -- right.                       
               
              
 
Q:  But -- But after that -- so
 the correspondence stopped, 
and you didn't  know what was 
going on with your parents at that time?      
                                                    
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  Neither of you did?               
                           
 
A:  No, because I had no way of 
getting in touch with anybody.   
 
Q:  And neither did your sister, she was al
ready out of the country --          
                       
                      
 
A:  No, the same thing.               
                           
 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah.  An d the 
first that you hear, then, is 
when you get this letter from 
Barcelona in 1941?         
                 
 
A:  Right.                         
               
               
 

Q;  So between '39 and '41 
you don't know whether they're 
dead, whether they're alive, 
whether they're deported, wh ether they're --     
                         
                         
 
A:  Well, between the time that -- I'm not
 sure of the exact 
day wh en  Ho lland was 
invaded.  Between that time -- 
as long as Holland was free, 
I was able to send a letter to 
Holland, and they would send it on and vice ve
rsa.  But once Holland was gone, that was 
the end.                   
                       
 
Q:  Okay .  So where were your parents the 
last time you had any co
rrespondence?  Were 
they still in Cologne?      
               
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  And how was your father able to make 
a living?  Was it from the proceeds of having 
sold the house?          
                 
 
A:  Well, he wasn't in busin ess anymore beca
use being in business, people know you.  
You got to have a license; you got to -- yo
u know, all that sort of thing.     
                     
 
Q:  Right.  So how did they eat?        
                         
 
A:  They had some money.              
                           
 
Q:  Okay.  So it was the -- it was the sale that
 they were able to ha
ve before things got 
very strict --                         
 
A.  Right.                         
               
               
 
Q:  -- that they still were able to
 live off of?  Is this --     
 
A:  Well, no.  I mean, they didn
't have to go hungry
.  It's just they ha
d to -- people didn't 
know them in Cologne.               
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  So if they went to a store, they 
just had to  go in and out and be careful.
                       
                       
Q:  Did you ever see their apartment in
 Cologne?                 
 
A:  Yes, once.  And in '38 -- no, in Christma
s vacation of '37, I we
nt back once and went 
to Cologne.            
                
 
Q:  And what did it look like?          
                         
 
A:  The end -- Christmas of 1937.        
                        
 
Q:  Well, was it mu ch different from what you had left
?  I mean,  you saw --                 
              
             

A:  Well, we had a whole house in Bo ppar
d.  This was an -- I mean, it was a nice 
apartment to -- It was -- I slept in the livin
g room, and they  had their bedroom, you know.  
You had sort of hide, get lost somewhere.  
They had to  get lost 
because nobody knew 
them there, and they were ab
le to get away with it.  
 
Q:  Did the atmosphere in the streets, wa
s it different than what you had rememb ered 
from before?            
                 
 
A:  Well, it was -- it's -- you have to re
memb er, Cologne was a big city.  Boppard was a 
little town where you knew everybody; you'd go 
out your front door
, you'd immediately 
see people that you knew.           
                       
                      
 
Q:  Okay.  So I guess what I'm g o ing after is
 a sense of the politics 
in the air and whether 
there was more Nazi symbolism, whether there were more ki ds on the street.       
               
 
A:  The same all over.                
                           
 
Q:  The same.             
                    
                   
 
A:  Same all over, same all over.        
                        
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  I mean, the friends I had in Boppard , like next 
door, we couldn 't  correspond.            
                          
Q:  Yeah.  Did you ever correspond with 
any of your friends after the war?               
                
                
A:  They'd  all moved out.  Some of th
em gotten married and moved away, and it was 
very hard getting in touch with
 them.  Some of their parents were still there, you know.  
But --                
 
Q:  Was -- Was the -- Were the relationships
 broken?  You had left when  you were 10 

years old and --          
                 
 
A:  Well, they were because I had a differe
nt life then.  And -- and my -- you know, my 
whole life was completely different.      
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.  When your parents were in Barcel
ona, how long did they stay there?       
                         
A:  I'm not sure.  Probably two or three week
s.  They'd  stay there till they could get on a 
ship.                             
 
Q:  And then they came to wh
ere in the UK?        
               
 
A:  Brooklyn.                       
               
              
 
Q:  Oh, they went straight
 to the United States?   
              
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 

Q:  Ah.  So they didn't even co
me to the UK, they went straight
 to the U.S.?                   
                          
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  And the reason for that was what?     
                       
 
A:  Well, they had -- they had relatives here
.  They  had planned on coming here, but their 
-- their number, you know, the --      
 
Q:  The quota number?                 
                           
 
A:  Was too high to get out earlier.      
                       
 
Q:  I see.  Do you know
 when they applied for 
a U.S. visa?       
 
A:  I'm not sure.  Look, I was nine, 10 years old, 
11 years old. I don't know when .          
                          
Q:  Okay.  Okay.                    
               
              
 
A:  In those days they  didn't  di
scuss that with us, you know.    
 
Q:  So you knew that they were in
 the United States, they wrote to y
ou from the U.S.?           
                  
A:  Oh, yes, oh, the minute they got here. 
                      
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And, I mean, I know I had cousins here. 
 My father had two sisters who lived here 
who had gone there, you know, years ago and 
so on.  And there was another cousin who 
was dead by the time I came he
re who gave them their -- 
what do you call it?     
 
Q:  Sponsored them?                  
                            
 
A:  Yeah, sponsored them and 
what-have-you.  He had some 
kind of business and so on.  
But the thing is I've got papers of all these 
things, and every once in a while Julia will go 
through them and be just amazed,
 these old papers.       
                
 
Q:  They really show the history of what
 happens to people, the documents from way 
back then.                
                    
 
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  So you're in -- when you
r parents come to the States
 in 1941, your sister soon 
follows, correct?  She comes --           
 
A:  She was here a little b
it -- few months before her -- 
b
efore them.                           
                
               
Q:  Oh, really?  She was able to
 go because your relatives sponso
red her into the country?     
                  
A:  No, right.  I mean basically 
they sponsored the whole fami
ly.                             
               
              
 

Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And she lived with this cousin.  I me
an, the cousin was marri
ed already and what-
have-you, you know.  I mean, th
ey were all so  much older th
an we were.  They lived in 
Flushing.         
 
Q:  I know it, yeah.  And so  she came over -- remind me ag
ain in 1941.                        
               
              
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  A little bit before your parents.  Then
 your parents came. A
nd why is it that you 
stayed in Britain until 1944
?             
 
A:  Well, first of all, I was too youn
g to go to work.           
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And I had a good life there, and my  pa
rents couldn't afford
 me.  You know, my 
mo ther had -- my  father had a job washing di
shes in a restaurant, and my mother was 
packing hair nets into envelopes in a factory.         
                                
 
Q:  It was hard.                    
               
              
 
A:  I would have had to  go to school.  Bu
t when I was 14, the pe
ople where I lived, you 
know, the younger people all had to go
 in the army.             
                                       
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  So th ey asked me would I mind leaving sc
hool in eighth grad e and going to wo rk fo r 
them in the -- they had a big fu
rniture business.  And I said, 
"No, of course not."  So -- 
And I learned a lot.  I learned -- I worked
 for the lawyer in 
the business.    
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And I worked there until I came here.  A
nd they were all very good to me.  And, I 
mean, I had a good life.  I can 't -- I really ca
n 't complain except that
 I wasn't with my 
parents, you know.  But they were very good to me.  They 
still sent a car for me every -- 
every Sunday to come out to their place and a
ll that.  And -- no.  And I went -- and one of 
the girls that I had lived -- had lived
 with us, you know --       
                   
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  -- her parents moved to Nottingham becaus
e the father needed 
a job so -- certain -- 
actually the name of the people that got hi
m, Sir Julien Cahn, he owned a house they 
gave them to live in.              
                                               
 
Q:  So Julien Cahn was the --   
                 
                
 

A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  -- furniture --                   
                           
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  -- manufacturer?  Okay.             
                         
 
A:  Not manufacturer.  Stores.          
                         
 
Q:  Stores, okay.                    
                            
 
A:  And they  -- And he like lent them a house.
  And th ey said I could stay with them, I 
didn't  have to pay, you know.  So th en I wo rk
ed in his office, so we
 helped -- one of the 
girls and her father worked in the office, and 
I worked for the lawyer 
in the office.  When 
I came here -- this is amazing -- my parents sa
id, "You got to finish high school, got to  
finish high school." They di
dn't fo rget.  So I went downt
own.  I was work ing down town ; 
I had a job in an import/export place.  So I 
went to Washington Ir
ving High School and 
asked them, and they  said, "Well, we got to 
test you first."  So by the time the test was 
finished and they evaluated, 
they said, "Listen, all you n
eed is civics and American 
history, you're ahead of everything else. 
In math and everything else, you ahead of 
everybody."            
 
Q:  In all the subjects?              
              
             
 
A:  So all I do is go to nigh
t school for the -- a couple of 
semesters like and I got my  -- 
I've still got it, my high scho
ol diploma.               
                     
                     
 
Q:  {Laughing.}  That shows you British education, doesn 't it ?   
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  Yeah.  So tell me a little 
bit about what was it 
like when you did come
 to the States?  
It's the first time you see your parents in eight 
years, and you left a child, and you're there 
as an 18-year-old.                   
                            
 
A:  Well, I'll tell you something else.  When I came over, I came on a -- on a -- in a 

convoy, in a banana boat; it was full of kids, 
full of Jewish kids whose parents were here 
in the same situation.  And we were told "
If we let you go, you mu
st not tell anybody not 
even your parents that you're 
comi ng" because it's a convoy, 
the other boats have soldiers 
and armaments in them.  We went -- We left 
on the first of March.  We went all the way 
up north; it took us a whole month to get to New York , to
 Brooklyn.               
                   
                   
 
Q:  Oh, really?  So you went
 by Greenland and Canada and 
things like that to get to 
Brooklyn?                
                    
 
A:  All the way up north.  Took us 
a whole month.  I arrived here on th
e first of April.          
                   

Q:  My goodness.                    
               
              
 
A:  And my  parents didn't even know I was coming.  So  there was a lady from -- I don't 
reme mb er the organization, a women's -- Je
wish wo men's organization; they had a -- 
midtown they -- on 59th Street someplace, they 
had an office.  And she took me there.  
And my parents at that time c
ouldn't afford a telephone, so 
she couldn't -- so she had to 
take me there; and it was on the Saturday
, and luckily they were home and -- well, 
everybody cried.               
                      
                      
 
Q:  {Laughing.}  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot had happ
ened in those eight years.             
                           
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  So what did they  
look like when you first 
saw them again?    
 
A:  Well, they -- I guess they looked older.  I mean, they -- you 
know, they'd  been 
work ing hard and trying to make ends meet. 
 
Q:  What kind of a place did they live 
in in Flushing?           
 
A:  In -- No, no.  My parents lived on 151st Street
.  They had a small apartment.           
              
             
Q:  In Manhattan?                   
               
              
 
A:  In Manhattan, in Washington Heights. 
                        
 
Q:  Ah, yeah, okay.                  
                            
 
A:  Yeah.  That's  where they all lived.  
                        
 
Q:  Okay.  It's a lovely area.         
                          
 
A:  And they  lived between Broadway  and Ri
verside Drive, on 151st Street.  And they 
had a one-bedroom apartment, and my sister
 lived with them.  And we had a pull-out 
couch, and we slept in the living room.  We made do.
                           
 
Q:  Were they unhappy, your parents, or we
re they -- were they -- I mean, your father 
was so good-natured, you say, 
wh en he was in Germany and you were growing 
up --                     
 
A:  Well, he'd  gotten older, and he'd  gone
 th rough a lot, you know, mentally and 
physically.  And he -- he was not the same man.
  All I know is when I was a little kid, he 
was comp letely bald, and when  I saw him here
, he had hair all of a sudden.      
 
Q:  Gray hair, I must think?           
                          
 
A:  White hair.  But, I mean, it was hair.  No
, I mean, he -- the sense of humor was gone.  
But then  he was mu ch older, you know; he was older.  That whole life that he had gone 
through had made a difference.     
                   
                   
 

Q:  What about your mother --  
                 
                 
 
A:  Because he never knew whether he
 would see us children again.    
                           
              
             
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  I mean, when once ha
ppened to that situation, terrible.      
 
Q:  Did they  ever talk of it, of what happened in those 
years when --                          
                
                
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  No, huh?                       
               
               
 
A:  I mean, physically nothing happened to  
them in Germany.  I mean, thank God they 
moved to  Co logne where nobody knew them, you know.
  And that was it.                                     
 
Q:  But it still is a life that is full of stress
 because if you have to
 be careful every time 
you walk out the door --           
 
A:  Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  Ab
solutely.  Absolutely
.  I mean, that's w
hy th e neighbor said 
to them "You got to get out of town" becau
se everybody knew them.   
                            
 
Q:  Did they  find out about wh at had happe
ned to the other people, Jewish people in 
Boppard?              
                  
 
A:  Well, I know that the ones
 that -- the families of the one
s -- the one girl had an older 
brother, and the other one, all of a sudden the 
mother in 1938, I think, she had a little boy, 
and I just -- and I mean, Ella was --  
                     
 
Q:  Ella with the candy?              
                           
 
A:  Ella was the girl that I played with, 
and she was my  age. So I don't know.  I guess it 
was an accident.  They all were marched to
 the small town, next town and taken to 
concen tration camp.  They  don't know.  
                    
                    
 
Q:  What about your mother, how -- how had she changed?          
 
A:  Well, you know, she'd been doing -- taking 
care of th e house and stuff like that, and 
all of a sudden, she had to ge
t up every mo rning and go to a fa
ctory and --                         
 
Q:  And put hair nets in envelopes.     
                         
 
A:  -- hair nets in envelopes.         
                          
 
Q:  Did they  dislike America, or did th
ey -- I mean, how did 
they react to their 
circumstan ces?             
                  
 

A:  No.  I mean -- no, the -- no, no, no, no.  Th
ey accepted it. This is
 -- this is better than, 
I think, being in  Germany.       
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  Sure.  I mean, they were -- they were ha
ppy that they got out.             
                        
                        
Q:  And they  mu st have been very happy th at they got you back ?   
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.               
                            
 
Q:  You and your sister.  Did life get easier for them as 
time went on?                        
               
               
A:  Well, afterwards they -- after a few years 
-- let's see. '41 Igot 
married, and then they 
moved to  the Isabella House.  I don't know if yo
u ever heard of that.  It was like a senior 
citizen, Jew ish senior citizen place which 
was up next to the Ge
orge Washington High 
School, if that means anything to you.    
 
Q:  No.  I mean, I don't know the high sc
hool --                 
 
A:  No.  I mean, it was uptown in Wash
ington Heights.            
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  And they lived there.  
And then, you know, till my father
 died.  And he was 96.  My 
mother was 95.  They just we
nt to sleep and didn't wake up,
 and I was -- we were very 
lucky with that.               
                       
                      
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  Because what I see now, people in pain, 
back pain, surgery doesn
't help and all that 
kind of stuff that people have now.    
 
Q:  They suffer for years.    
                  
                 
 
A:  Hmm?                          
                
               
 
Q:  They suffer for years.  People suffer fo r years with their pain when --      
                                           
A:  Oh, terrible.                    
                            
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  I mean, I see it every day now, you 
know.                    
 
Q;  So if your father died at
 age 96, that would put him that
 he died in the early '70s, 
1970's?                
                  
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 

Q:  And your mother then --            
                          
 
A:  In '87.                        
               
               
 
Q:  In '87?  Boy, they -- they liv
ed a good long time.           
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Yes.                  
               
              
 
Q:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
A:  I mean, health-wise, they had a good life, thank God.        
 
Q:  Did they -- Did your father ever work 
in  a different place after those early years 
working in a --          
                
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  No?                           
                               
 
A:  No.  He worked in one 
place until he retired.  Then he came here.     
                          
                         
Q:  When he came here, yeah?           
                          
 
A:  Yeah.  He always work ed in  the same
 restaurant downtown.  I don't know which 
restaurant.  I don't remember.  
                
 
Q:  And your mom?                                               
 
A:  Hmm?                          
                
               
 
Q:  She worked in the same factory, too? 
                        
 
A:  Yeah.  Well, my sister worked in 
the office there, and she got he

Q:  Got it.                        
               
               
 
A.  when she needs a job, better eat.    
                        
 
Q:  And yourself, did they stay in New York
 and did you stay in New Yo rk when you 
married or --              
                    
 
A:  Well, first we lived in New York on hu
ndred and -- what was it? -- 151st and hundred  
and -- I think hundred and sixty -- I think hu
ndred sixty-first near the -- near Riverside 
Drive.      
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And then  we decided -- Oh, and th en we
 got a whole apartment on 134th Street, and 
then we decided to buy a hous
e and have some children.                   
                
                
 
Q:  In New York?                    
               
              
 

A:  No, in New Jersey.                
                           
 
Q:  Uh-huh.                        
               
               
 
A:  My husband wo rked  in Brooklyn, and we 
didn't  want to live in New York  anymore.  
                        
Q:  What year did you get married?       
                        
 
A:  1947.                          
               
               
 
Q:  You got married young, at 21?        
                        
 
A:  Oh, not what you hear nowad
ays.                              
 
Q:  Yeah.  And your husband, was he 
also from Europe or --       
 
A:  Yeah, he was from Germany too.       
                        
 
Q:  So he had similar experi
ences to you?                        
 
A:  Oh, no.  He was -- His father had a me
tal business, a scrap me
tal business, and he 
worked there.  And then his fa
ther died in -- let's see.  
Judy was -- in 1951 when  Judy was 
born, and then he took over 
the business.  He was in Br
ooklyn; he went to Brooklyn 
every day.                     
                         
 
Q:  How did you end up in living in Ba
ltimore?                   
 
A:  Because my husband had Alzh
eimer's.  We had a beautiful
 house in New Jersey.  M y  
husband had Alzheimer's.  I had around-the-c
lock help with him.  And it was just a 
question of staying in New Je
rsey where my other daughter is all h ere.       
 
Q:  I see.               
                                       
 
A.  And the place where -- the only place that 
I considered would ha
ve been three and a 
half hours for Julia to get to and an hour and a 
half for Marian (ph) to get to, and I felt in 
an emergency, it's -- Julia liv
es in Towson, and I'm in No
rth Oaks.  I don't know if you 
ever heard of that; in Baltimore. 
 It's a senior citizen thing.  
So we decided that Julie kept 
going till she found an apartmen
t there that she thought woul
d suit me, and I came down 
and looked, and that was it.      
                   
 
Q:  How long have you lived
 in Baltimore now?                    
 
A:  I moved in in March -- March 9th in 2-0-0 -- 2-0-0-9.        
 
Q:  Yeah.  So most of your life ha
s been in the New York/New 
Jersey area rather --            
                     
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  -- in the United States rather th an
 down here?               
 

A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And you said you went back  to Germ
any.  When was it that you went back  to 
Germany?                    
                        
 
A:  We went a few times.  
My husband's father had a business there in Ulm, Germany, 
and they  got it back, and he sort of -- his br
other was not in the business at the time; he 
was in a different type of business, so he sa
id to go back  and so rt of take care of it 
because my father-in-law had died.               
 
Q:  Mm-hmm.              
                                       
 
A:  And so I used to go with
 them, and then  we 'd  make a vacation someplace.  We'd  go 
sometimes to Switzerland, and sometimes we 
would just, you know, tr
avel around in the 
car and what-have-you.                     
               
               
 
Q:  There are many people who've -- German Jewish people who never wanted  to go 
back.                    
                     
 
A:  I know.                        
               
               
 
Q:  Didn't like to go back.           
                           
 
A:  I know.                        
               
               
 
Q:  And you're different.  How would you explain 
that?  How would you explain --          
                        
A:  Well, they -- their life was taken apart. 
 What else can I say?  You know.  And they 
lost a lot of family; a lot of 
people lost a lot of family, a
nd -- and they -- they didn't trust 
the Germans.  And the German
s to them were all Nazis. 
 Now, I know personally, I 
mean, I met a lot of people after the war in Ul
m and in -- we went -- we took the children 
too to see where we were born.  And I felt 
a neighbor of ours who was not Jewish didn't 
have to say boo, came over to my  parents, said
, "Get out of town .  I've heard rumo rs," has 
to be a decent person to even  dare becaus
e in a small town, ever
ybody knows you, so she 
didn't  know -- or he didn't know wh ether anyb
ody would see him coming into 
our house.                        
Q:  Yeah.  So you didn't have
 the same sort of bitter feeli
ng. Is that -- Can I put it that 
way?               
                 
 
A:  Well, I didn't .  I was a child.  I was -- 
you know, it's  different 
when you're grown up 
and you've got to give up 
everything and --            
                                   
 
Q:  Did your parents ever go back?      
                         
 
A:  No.  No, they never -- They were getting ol
d, and they were working; they were tired.  
And they  couldn't afford to a
nyhow. But, no, we went to Eu
rope quite a few times.  And 

then once we  took a
ll the children with us and -- once 
the children were born and so  on.  
And then  a lot of people started writing to us from 
Germany, you know, and so --   
                 
                
Q:  You mean former neighbors and form
er friends?                
 
A:  Former neighbors.                
                            
 
Q:  Did they --                     
               
              
 
A:  But they all died, then,you know, as they get older a
nd th ey die of one thing and 
another.              
                 
 
Q:  But when they wrote, did 
they then fill in so
me of the gaps of what had happened 
during the war?           
                  
 
A:  No.  They didn't w ant to talk ab
out it either.               
 
Q:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
A:  But I mean, the ones -- you know, you 
knew who was who.  We knew who was a 
Nazi and who wasn't and was decent.
  So the ones who tried, the Nazis, we didn't ev
en --                        
Q:  Of course not.                   
                            
 
A:  -- answer anything.  The others we'd  wr ite for Christmas or something like that, and 
that was it.                            
 
Q:  Did your -- Did your ch ildren ask a lot of
 questions about your 
experiences as they 
were growing up?                        
 
A:  Oh, they know, I mean, you 
know, that I went to England and the whole bit.  Oh, yes, 
they know the story.                    
 
Q:  Because some people just never 
talked at all, never --       
 
A:  I know.  I know.  No, my children know.
  I mean, I can only 
say my  whole life I was 
lucky.  You have to ag
ree to that.       
 
Q:  Well, it is --                   
                            
 
A:  I mean, in one sense, all right, I was separated from my
 parents --                         
               
               
Q:  That's  painful, yes.              
              
             
 
A:  But I was as lucky as anybody could be.  
I was sent to priv ate schools.  I never was 
hungry.  I had clothes -- Well, we had school uni
fo rms, in England, so we kind of got that 
and all, you know.  And you look at it -- I th
ink you lo ok at it different when  you're a 
child than  when  you'r e a grown-up, the th ings 
that are important to you.  I me an, it was 
important to us that on Sundays, this car -- 
the car stood in front 
of the door with a 

chauffeur and we went to go sw imming or 
watch the ball game, the cricket game or 
something.                        
 
Q:  That's  perfectly normal.  That's so nor
mal.  Every kid wants to --          
                        
                       
A:  Of course.            
                    
                   
 
Q:  Of course.            
                    
                   
 
A:  Of course.            
                    
                   
 
Q:  Yeah.  And it sounds, then, 
you were able to have some 
p
art of a kid's life?                
                         
A:  Oh, yeah, definitely, defin
itely.  I mean, the ch
ildren in the schools 
in England, they 
invited us to their birthday pa
rties, and we knew their parent
s, and they were very nice; 
they'd  invite us for dinner 
once in a while or come and see us, you know.  Oh, no.  And 
we had a very nice -- and this was in the school
 -- pian o teacher.  And th is was, of course, 
a private thing, piano teacher
 -- I had piano lesson in Germ
any already.  Piano teacher 
and elocution with our English.
  And we played all the sports.  I was on the tennis team.  
I was on the -- what they called netball which is
 basketball here team, and I met a  lot of 
people and lot of sports, and so that's wher
e I ended up, you know, doing wh at
 I enjoyed.                        
Q:  Did -- In the 30 years that both of your
 parents -- 30 or 40 years that your parents 
lived in the United States, did 
they ever talk about what 
life had been like from the time 
you left,  that you were no longer there?        
              
             
 
A:  Well, they used to say it was so quiet in the house, 
you know?                            
                               
Q:  Oh.                           
                               
 
A:  {Laughing.}  They missed my noise.    
                       
 
Q:  And the mischievousness.            
                         
 
A:  {Laughing.}  Of course, my father misse d  
the business, but he didn't  talk t o  us about 
the busin ess, you know.               
 
Q:  And I mean, was it such th
at they -- after -- In the first years after coming to a new 
place, most people have it very hard.        
                          
                          
 
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  Very, very hard to adjust their 
circumstan ces --             
 
A:  Abso lutely.                     
               
              
 
Q:  -- are usually far --              
                          
 
A:  Oh, no, especially --             
              
             
 

Q:  -- far w o rse.                    
                            
 
A:  I mean, my  mo ther knew English, but my  
father didn 't, and this was very difficult for 
him.  But my mother -- that's
 why she took me to -- she went
 with me to England because 
she could talk to, you know, the pe
ople there.                             
 
Q:  Okay.  And I'm w o ndering is that did that
 hardship ever change
 for them?  Did they 
ever -- Even though they
 stayed in the same jobs, did th
ey ever enjoy life in a different 
way in the -- in those decades?             
                            
 
A:  Well, we had good times together.  We
'd  go out together.  Of course, when the 
children were born, th ey -- you know, they  used 
to come to the house.  We used to pick 
them up New Yo rk and taken them out to Englew
ood -- we first lived in Englewood in    
New Jersey and so on.  Oh, no
.  We had them there nearly 
every weekend; they'd  spend 
the day with us and with the 
kids, you know, or we'd  go into
 New York with them or my 
mo ther would take the kids to the movies 
or some downtown, you 
know, but, you know, 
that sort of thing.  But no.  It was -- Of 
course, it was a big change for them, and -- and 
they were getting older.  I mean, they weren'
t -- they weren't young where change doesn't  
affect you th at way, you know.  Bu t they acce
pted it.  I mean, their thing was as long as 
we're together.                       
 
Q:  And that is -- that is the most 
important thing.             
 
A:  Exactly.                        
               
              
 
Q:  Is there anything else you'd like to add to
 what we'v e talked about today that I might 
not have asked you that
 you  think is important for people to know 
about?                     
 
A:  Not really.  I mean  -- no, I was very luck
y in my marriage, too. 
 My husband's fa mily 
was very nice too.                     
 
Q:  Did they  -- Did his parents ma ke it out?  Of
 course, his father made it out, yes.  So he 
had them in New York as well?    
 
A:  His parents lived on Riverside Drive.  He
 lived in the Riverside 
Drive.  And when he 
took me there -- we got engaged. As a matter 
of fact, we had just been to an ice hockey 
game at the Madison Square Garden down town
.  And on the way back, he asked me to 
marry him.  So he said, "You might as well 
co me upstairs" -- it was an afternoon game -- 
"meet my  parents."  I'd never met them.  And 
so we walk in there, and one of the first 
things is his father, very friendly guy, says, 
"You know, if you 're goi
ng to be part of the 
family, we might as well know wh en your birt
hday is."  So I told  him when my birthday 
is, and all of a sudden, they looked at each
 other, and they started to laugh.  I said, 
"What's funny about it?"  Was his birthday too,
 my  father-in-law's birthday.  And then  it 

turns out my  brother-in-law had birthday same 
day as my  mo ther, so we used  to have 
huge parties.                                              
 
Q:  How nice.             
                    
                   
 
A:  Oh, yes.                       
               
               
 
Q:  How nice.  Okay.  Well, I think that 
this concludes our interview --        
                      
                      
A:  Okay.                          
               
               
 
Q:  -- with Mrs. Hilde Gundel

 much.                  
                     
 
A:  You're welcome.  It was nice 
meeting -- your name is Ina?    
 
Q:  Ina.                          
                               
 
A:  Ina.  Ina.  I thought it sounds like
 Jean.                   
 
Q:  Yeah.  Ina ____.                 
                            
 
A:  Very nice meeting you.             
                          
 
Q:  Thank you.
