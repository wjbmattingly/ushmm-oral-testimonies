ABRAM JAKUBOWICZ 
July 14, 1999 
Tape 1, Side A
 
 
[copy checked and partially authenticated by AD on 8/31/05] 
 
 

Q: This is an interview with Ab
e, Abram Jakubowicz.  It™s July 14
th
, 1999.  And this is part of a 
collection of interviews with 
Holocaust survivors living in Ke
ntucky, sponsored jointly by the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and 
the Kentucky Oral Hi story Commission.  The 
interviewer is Arwen Donahue.  And for this in
terview we are going to not go over all of Mr. 
Jakubowicz™s experiences from his Holocaust and 
pre-Holocaust years, because he has already 
been interviewed by the Survivors of the S
hoah Foundation.  That interview was conducted on 
February 19
th
, 1996.  So, we™re going to just briefly summ
arize what was said in that interview 
and ask some questions to fill in and then we™re 
going to go on and explore his post-war life  in 
more detail.  This is tape numb
er one, side A.  Okay, so, you tell me  if I get any of the facts 
wrong and I™ll tell you what I ha
ve written down from your Shoa
h Foundation interview.  You 
were born– hmm?  
 

A: I™mlistening. 

 

Q: Okay.  You were born in Piotrków, Po
land on September 24, 1924.  Grew up in Grodzisk, 
Mazowiecki.  Your grandfather Chaim Jakubowicz wa
s the head of the Jewish community there.  
You had one brother, Gershon, he was born in 19
29.  You me ntioned that
 your parents worked, 
say again what their work was? 
 
A: My grandfather from bot h sides, my grandmot
her, had shoe stores.  But my father, he bought 
from the tannery, when they ma ke the leather, one 
part is what ma kes leather, the other part is 
like beady stuff.  Doesn™t smell good, you know it.  
They use it mostly for glycerin, Vaseline, 
chemical factories.  So in any tannery, when 
they had enough that we could send in a truck, you 
know it, so we could pick and give it to the ta
nneries.  I don™t know how 
I can explain it closer. 
 
Q: What was your mother™s ma iden name ?  

 

A: Bluma, B L U M A and Hannah, Hanna
h was her mi ddle name.  Bluma Hannah. 
 

Q: And we got your father™s name  and her name on the other interview.  Okay, now you me ntioned 
that you went to high school in 
Wa rsaw.  Is that correct?    
 

A: I went to Warsaw and I went to Piotrków.  I 
went to Piotrków first and I was away too much 
from my par e nts and I got homesick, so they took
 me back.  They sent me from Grodzisk to 
Warsaw.  And the gymnasium was not in [INAU
DIBLE], it was– came  out from the Jewish 
Federation, not Federation that time– the Geme nnah 
(ph )
. 
 

Q: Were you in Wa rsaw when the 
war broke out in September, 1939?

A: We lived Grodzisk, but Warsaw is only about 
30 kilome ters, 20 miles 
from Wa rsaw.  Now I 
know, I found out they attached it to Wa rsaw, but at that time not. 
 
Q: Okay, so you were in Grodzisk. 

 

A: Grodzisk. 

 

Q: Grodzisk.  And you we re there, living through the 
various restrictions th
at happened, that came  
along with the German occupation of Poland? 
 

A: Yeah, not quite, because the fifth of Februar
y, 1941, all the Jews had to leave Grodzisk, and we 
all had to go to the ghetto.  And 
before this there was kind of re
striction, but it wasn™t that bad, 
you know.  You had to go to work, you had to 
do other things, but it was not too bad. 
 

Q: Can you, you did describe your, some  general th
ings about your experi
ences in the Warsaw 
ghetto in your interview, in your prior interv
iew.  But I wondered if you would say some thing 

more about it, in particular some thing about your
 living situation there. 
 Where did you live and 
with whom? 
 

A: We lived on Twarda 
(ph)
 24
th
, Twarda 26, as far as I can remember now, was a corner from 
Chepa 
(ph )
 and they called it the sma
ll ghetto.  So, I went to school, when I went to school, I 
went on the bus two streets away from the Twarda.  You know.  So I knew this very good, the 

surrounding. 
 

Q: Who, what was your house like?   And who did you live with? 

 
A: Okay, we got moved in and there was tw
o young girls, approximately 18 and 20, and their 
parents went to Russia.  You know, and they ran 
away and they couldn™t ge
t back or whatever it 
is, so we lived with the girls in 
that flat, in that apartment.  There was my  grandfather, from my 
father™s side, my grandmother, and there was my father and mother and my brother, including 
me .  We wer e  the same .  I can™t recall was it two ro
om or three rooms.  I don™t remembe r .  It was 
there on the second floor. 
 

Q: Was it a comfortabl
e, living situation? 
 

A: It was not comfortable.  It 
was, you know, you had to live.  But 
comfort, in the ghetto, there was 
no such a thing.  You know, but it was better than 
a lot of people, they got worse apartment.   
 

Q: I was asking because I know that so ma ny 
peopl e were so crowded and it sounded like you had a 
relativel y– 
 

A: Relatively we  had, not bad, you know it, because it 
was second floor.  It was only two girls, what 
they lived before.  So it was crowded, but it 
was not too bad.  You could live, you know. 
 

Q: And you kept going to school.

A: Later on, since I went to th
e school before and there was onl
y one school in the Natenzona 
(ph )
, 
you know I told you it came  from the Jewish, you 
know what they call it, the Jewish Fe deration, 
so they opened it.  It was still open a
nd I got a chance to go, yes, in the school. 
 
Q: This was the same – let me  make sure I unders
tand.  This was the same  school that you had gone 
to before?  
 

A: Exactly the same  school I went before. 

 

Q: And it just ended up 
being within the ghetto? 
 

A: Yes, it was in the ghetto.  And it was about tw
o blocks, you know, where we lived from there, or 
three blocks.  So it was clos
e.  It was not too bad.   
 

Q: What was the name  of the school? 

 

A: Natenzon 
(ph )
.  And it was a technical school, if you want
 to be an engineer or some thing– as 
far as I reme mber in Poland we had, I think it
 was in 1933, every student
 had to wear, I don™t 
think in the ghetto was, but before the war 
Œ it wa s on your arm, on the left hand side.   
 

Q: Did you have a goal of becomi ng an engineer at the time? 

 

A: Really, not, you know it.  It™s only for the whil
e.  It was close because
 I came from Piotrków 
back.  I couldn™t stay, so they put me  in there,
 mo re than to go in another high school.  You 
know, at that time, you still don™
t know what you want to be. 
 
Q: So you were, you also mentioned going to the movi
es and cultural life, I 
wondered if you™d say a 
little bit more about that? 
 
A: In the ghetto?  In the 
ghetto, yes, they had a lo
t of operettas.  They had some movies and when 
you had a little bit money, you know you could enjoy, do 
a lot of things with it.  But we had to 
watch out.  I went out a lot with my mo
ther and friends, we we nt to it, yes. 
 

Q: How did your fa mily get money?  

 

A: We could bring certain things 
in.  We rented a cart, with a ho
rse and buggy and certain things we 
brought in.  And soon when we sa
w that it starts runni
ng out.  We  didn™t know it would last so 
long.  And that was the reason w
hy we later on, about three months
, we left the Wa rsaw ghetto 
or it would mean starvation.   
 

Q: Okay, so you left the Warsaw ghett
o after about three 
or four months– 
 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: –when your fa mily decided 
to separate and to escape. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

4
A: Thatisright. 
 

Q: You and your mother and your brother went out
 of the ghetto together
 and then you me t your 
father there?  Did your grandparents–? 
 

A: No, no.  My grandparents staye
d, from my father™s side.  Bu
t we went to Piotrków and you 
needed, in order to escape if they caught you, 
you got shot.  So, we thought we™d split up and 
then after a certain amount of 
time, I don™t know exactly how long, 
my father joined us.  He 
escaped the same  way, you know it, and joined 
us  in Piotrków, because there is where my 
grandmother from my mother™s sidelived. 
 

Q: And what was her name ?   Your grandmother? 

 

A: Zudla Ritterband, R I T T E R 
B A N D or sometimes I see now, 
Riterband with one T and one 
with two T™s, so I don™t 
know, I get confused.   
 

Q: And so you lived in the ghetto in Piotrków– 

 

A: Yeah, from there we escaped the Piotrków ghetto. 

 

Q: And your father worked in a glass factory there. 

 

A: Thatisright. 

 

Q: And you worked for a company that ma de 
office furniture for the German army.   
 
A: That is right.  
Aus Deutsche Republic 
(ph )
.   
 
Q: Did your brother work?   Gershon? 

 

A: He was too young.  He was born in 1929, though and 
I was born ‚24.  No, he did not, because in 
1941, he was only 12 years old.   
 

Q: Did you have– were you a
nd Gershon very close?    

 

A: Yes, we were very close.  It was a close fa mily. 

 

Q: I wondered, just speaking of your fa mily, I want to
 back track a little bit, 
because I had wanted to 
ask you, you me ntioned that your grandfather wa
s the head of the Jewish community.   
 

A: That™s right, he had a shoe store. 

 

Q: Would you say some thing about your fa mily histor
y?   Wa s there a long tradition of leadership in 
the Jewish co mmunity? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

5
A: Yes.  About the Jewish community.  My fath
er was only one son, but ye
s, every certain amount 
there was always election.  And th
ey elected who they wanted to
 represent them.  And he was 
always involved in politics about
 the Jewish people, you know it.  
So he always, as far as I can 
reme mber, always was elected. 
 
Q: Yourgrandfather? 

 

A: My grandfather.  And he had a shoe store, 
but mo stly it was run, and years ago, it sounds funny, 
the wome n r a n the store.  And they were doing a 
good job.  So mostly Jewish me n of that time, 
say they divided their time, mostly.  But for a lo
t of  them, for the community– or they went to 
the, they studied the Torah.  And he 
was in that  time, fairly religious. 
 

Q: Had your family been in that area 
of Poland, in Grodzisk, for a long time ?  

 

A: My mother was from Pi otrków.  And as far as 
I know it, my grandmother from my father™s side 
was from Pi otrków.  And at that time, ma rriages
 was made in matchmaking marriages.  So, since 
she came– she was highly intelligent and her fath
er was dead, so you know it, at that time years 
ago with a dowry, you know.  They didn™t care, th
ey were fairly off, they wanted somebody 
highly intelligent in their fa m
ily.  I don™t know, now it doesn™t ma ke sense, but that™s the way 
what it worked. 
 

Q: Yeah, I understand.  So then on October 13
th
, 1942, the ghetto was encircled.  And it was 
liquidated within one week.   
 

A: Thatisright. 

 
Q: And then the 2,000 people who worked in 
the glass factory were allowed to stay. 
 
A: Yeah, because the factory didn™t le
t them out.  And then they made 
staravarshaska
 
(ph )
, we 
called it the yiden 
(ph )
 gas.  And on the other side was the gun, 
staravarshaska
.  I remember.  
There was only one block, a big block, where 
they ma de wires, you know, where you couldn™t 
go.  And then they brought them back. 
 When everybody, everything was liquidated. 
 

Q: And your father was working in the glass factor
y, so he was allowed to, he was allowed to stay. 
 

A: That™s right, there was a few 
of them.  There was Hortensia 
(ph )
 and one was Kara 
(ph )
.  He 
worked with Kara.  They ma de gl
ass and it was, in that time it wa
s a war, so they put pieces of 
me tal in it.  If the bomb fell, they 
didn™t split any, it got– you know, so– 
 

Q: Your mother had the foresight
 to volunteer you as a carpenter. 
 

A: When we came to go away, you know, there is no volunteers.  They ask, ﬁ Who is a carpenter? ﬂ  
So, my mot her said, ﬁHe is a carpenter.ﬂ  And I 
had a piece of paper that
 I could leave the ghetto, 
before it, in order to go to my 
work.  She said, ﬁHe™s a carpenter.
ﬂ  So, this way they didn™t ask 
questions, just pulled me  out.  And I went as a carp
enter.  Wh at was the carpenter work?  It™s to 
ma ke shelves in one of the buildings, Kompu-Stego 
(ph )
.  And they bring from the old houses,

you know it was about 20,000 people, 21,000 Jewish pe
ople.  So they emptied everything and 
later on they shipped it to Germany.   
 
Q: And you saw your father occasionally, but did not live with him?  

 

A: No, I couldn™t. 

 

Q: Right.  About two mont hs, two or three months
 later, it was decided that about 1,000 more Jews 
would be deported. 
 

A: Were liquidated, not deported.  In fact there 
is now a monume nt, ma ybe 
you saw it, where they, I 
don™t know, six, 700 people, they got killed.  Th
ey took all the people in the synagogue, you 

know a lot of the kids, they got shot inside.  
It was really bad circumstances.  You cannot 
describe it.  After two or th
ree days, you know, the screaming, th
ey took us out and we were 
supposed to be shot.  And when they took me
 out, happened to be a gendarme, you know, a 
police man, a German police man, whom I happened to
 work with.  He says, ﬁHey, what are you 
doing here?ﬂ  Like I volunteered.  Kicked me
 out of it.  You know, he would say, ﬁYou don™t 
belong here.ﬂ 
 

Q: I wanted to ask you about that particular mo
ment, because it was striki ng to me that this 
gendarme saved your life.  Do you think he
 intended to save your life?    
 

A: He intended, yeah, because, a lot of the German
s, they go, ﬁWhat you doing? ﬂ   And he saw that I 
had a job.  Se e?   Most of them, they were hidi
ng out and they had no jobs  and there was a lot of 
children.  But he knew that I worked there.  Not b
ecause he wanted to save my life, no.  I didn™t 
know hi m so much.  But he only 
knew that I worked for him. 
 

Q: So, you didn™t have a pers
onal relationship with him?  
 

A: No, I didn™t know this guy at al
l.  But I reme mb er his name , Meister Poltin.  Yeah, he was a stiff 
ma n, was an older ma n, in fact, a day before, two 
days before, he shot a little girl.  She was 17, 
18 years, because he thought that she stole a 
pair of stockings, you know, when they put these 
things in.  He shot her,
 so– no, he did not know.  
 

Q: So, he was certainly not sympathetic– 

 

A: No, no.  I didn™t know him, no.   

 

Q: How did you feel at that point 
about the Germans in general?   
We re you getting a sense of what 
it was that they were capable of?   The depths of–? 
 

A: Oh yeah, I knew.  You know this didn™t co
me  overnight.  Wh en you saw it all the time, you 
know what they did.  And then when I was on the–when they took the people to Tr eblinka.  

And when some body didn™t go fast, they shot him.
  When an older woma n couldn™t move, they 

shot her.  You saw literally corpses everywhe
re.  You knew it.  Despite what my parents, 
especially my mother tried to keep me  she
ltered, but I knew it, you know.  You cannot close– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

otherwise I wouldn™t be norma l. 
 Ye s, we knew it.  In fact, a few days before they took 
Toma szow,  they took already one.  And they said 
to put him to death, put him to Treblinka.  We  
could still not believe it.  Why woul d they take pe
ople and put them to death?   So it didn™t ma ke 
any– you always, as long as you live, you have a littl
e bit of hope that the people are lying.  But 
deep inside we knew it, yeah.   
 
Q: At that point, what did you 
know about Treblinka?   Did you know–? 

 

A: I didn™t know it even existed.  They only said
 they go in a place and I didn™t know it was 
Treblinka .  A place where the pe ople get ga
ssed.  I didn™t even know wha t  place. 
 

Q: But you had heard that there was a extermination–? 

 

A: Yes, there wa s an extermination camp.  That™s
 right.  It takes people,
 and you know they bring 
them there– how or what, its only ma in purpos
e to liquidate the people.  A liquidation camp, 
you know. 
 

Q: So, your mo ther and your brother had alrea
dy been taken at that
 point, to Treblinka. 
 

A: Yeah, that wa s– you know, the date when th
ey pulled me  out, they went already there. 
 

Q: Did you know at that point, were you certain at 
that point that they had been killed?   Or was 
there a question in your mi nd that
 they mi ght still be alive? 
 

A: It™s always a question in your
 mi nd, but you know, certain things 
in life you know it is.  It™s 
easier to believe things what you 
would like to believe, even when we were there, we say, ﬁThey 
couldn™t do it.  They didn™t do nothi ng.  What 
do you want to take so many people and kill them 
at the same  time? ﬂ  You know?   But it was true
.  But I didn™t know.  I knew it and I didn™t know 
it, you know, because I wasn™t there. 
 But people talked about it.   
 

Q: After this gendarme took you– 

 

A: MeisterPoltin 
(ph )
, yeah. 
 

Q: –took you out of the group, then you said in yo
ur testimony that the other 900 or so people who 
had been gathered, were taken away. 
 

A: Eight or ni ne , later now I see it™s seve n you know
 it, because  some  of them got killed in there, 
inside and I didn™t count them.  
You know I knew it was a lot.  I di
d not know that they got shot. 
 

Q: Oh, you didn™t?   At that time? 

 

A: No, later on, when I came and they– we knew th
at they took them.  Rakhov was a little bitty 
forest and they shot them. 
 

Q: So, you found that out.  Did you fi
nd that out after the war?  Or..? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
8
 
 
8
 
A: No, right away when I was in the ghetto back.  
Because they always took 
other Jews to cover the 
graves and everything.  The 
Germans didn™t do this, so th
ey took some body to do it. 
 

Q: So, the word spread fast.   

 

A: Yeah,sure. 

 

Q: You me ntioned some thing I wanted to hear more
 about.  That the role of the Jewish police in 
this.  Can you say more about that? 
 

A: Jewish police was not angels.  When they put
 me  in the synagogue, the Germans didn™t put me  
in, the Jewish police.  The Germans probably told 
them we nee ded so ma ny to put in and catch 
everyone.  So, they did the dirty work for the Ge
rmans.  It™s like anything else, some body wants 
to be very good and is a hundred percent, when
 they ask you.  One thing you want to do ten 
percent better.  Okay?   And certain
 people, it is a ma tter of surviv
al, they have to do what they 
have to do.  But they didn™t do more.  But certa
in people were bad.  Jewish or not Jewi sh.  
Maybe they thought only this way they can surviv
e.  I don™t know it.  Certain people couldn™t do 
it.  You know? 
 

Q: Going on with the summary.  After a few da
ys, you were among 20 boys and 20 girls who were 
sent to Toma szow. 
 

A: TomaszowMazowiecki. 

 

Q: Mazowiecki.  You were there a few weeks. 
 
A: That™sright. 

 

Q: What were you doing there? 

 

A: Sa me  thing what we did, what we did in Piot
rków.  We  ma de shelving. 
 Collected everything and 
then we brought it to Piotrków.  They called it 
sammische, sammische stellen
 
(ph)
.  That means 
they brought everything together a
nd they shipped it to Germa ny.  When this was finished, they 
didn™t know what to do with us.  Luckily 
for us, they sent us to Starachowice. 
 

Q: Where you made a mmunition for the Germany military. 

 

A: That is right.  As I sai
d, called it Hermann Goering werk 
(ph)
.  There was already a big factory.  
But, I guess so, probably we did a good job.  And then 
to be truthful, I think 
at that time, we was 
watched by guys, other 
viklestande
 
(p h )
 division.  They were not so hateful, you know it.  They 
were young and we were young, so we talked.  They
 weren™t about to kill you.  Maybe they put 
in a good  word.  I don™t know it, but anyway
 they took– because 40 people doesn™t me an 
nothing– so we went to Star
achowice from there.   
 

Q: So, is this right?   That wa
s around June or July of 1943?    

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

9
 
A: That™s right.  Wa it a mi nute, 1943?   Yeah. 

 

Q: Tell me some more about your time in Starachowi
ce.  You didn™t tell very much about that in the 
fi rst interview.   
 

A: Starachowice was a big amm
unition factory.  They ma de 1.5 
though 15 millimeter– they ma de 
8.8 millimeter and 7.5 millimeter.  From the begi
nning I worked there, where you know, before 
you put it in the press.  There is 
a hydraulic press.  You have to
 ma ke it very, very hot, so the 
hydraulic press can pres
s it out, you know.   
 

Q: Press out bullets? 

 

A: Yeah, they pressed out only the shell.  Th
e bullets come  later on, you know.  But this was the 
shell what they ma de.  Oh, they get cleaned and a
ll kinds of things they wo
uld get.  So, I worked 
there and it was very hard and very hot.  
Luckily for me, I met a guy, his name was Chaim 
Enischmann 
(ph )
.  And his brother was from the Jews, the 
head of the Jews.  You know, that the 
German told him– you know it– 
 

Q: InStarachowice–? 

 

A: Yeah, and this Chaim Enischma nn, I didn™t know 
it before, he– and there was four other boys.  
There was five boys and he by ri
sking his own life, he
 brought us always food in the evening.  
You know it.  Ironically, he never survived.  Wa
s a very, very good person.  Only one from the 

five boys, no, two.  Is me and there was anothe
r guy.  Heniek– I tried to reme mber his name, 
but I can™t.  I saw him after the war.
  He went to Frankfurt and to 
college.  He was surprised that 
I didn™t go to college.  But stupid Abe got ma rried.  (Laughing.) 
 

Q: How did you find out what happe
ned to Chaim Enischma nn?    
 

A: Chaim, what™s his name, from hi m, fr om the 
other guy, he was with him together.  Enischma nn. 
 

Q: Say his name again? 

 

A: ChaimEnischmann. 

 

Q: Enischmann. 

 

A: Because his brother, had from the camp, from 
the Jewish side .  And he worked, his brother 
worked in the kitchen.  You know the older, wh
en we came home , he ma de  sure that we got 

some thing.   
 

Q: Why this– five particular boys?   Did he 
chose you out or were you part of a group? 

 

A: Yeah, no, we slept together, you know when you
 go up on the benches and you sleep.  Some  of 
us slept together.  And you know

want nothing in return.  He just wanted to hel
p.  He knew he cannot help
 more.  He can™t help 
everybody.  The other four boys, probably he knew 
them from before, they already were from 
there.  And some how he said, you know, ﬁI™ll help
 you do whatever I can.ﬂ  In life, what I found 
out everywhere, you need a little bit luck, but othe
r people will help you.  You have to be in the 
right spot .  And he just, you can 
say, it™s God™s will or not, if 
you are religious.  And he really 
helped me , you know, there. 
 
Q: Speaking of religion, was reli
gion a really important part of
 your life, up until that point? 
 

A: Religion was a very big point until 1939. 
 You know, I was not– my father– you saw the 
pictures from my grandfather, 
you know, he was religious.  He ha
d a beard, he had 
the traditional 
thing.  My father, not more.  But we went Sa
turdays to the synagogue. 
 We ate kosher.  You 
know what kosher is?  We Jewish people separate
 the milk from the, you know, you have to wait 
when you eat meat six hours after it.  It™s one wa
y of hygiene or some thing.  We  did this.  That 
was– I knew what I was.  Like some people ma ybe they would die for it.  And if some body 

were to tell me , Abe, if tomorrow you are a Chris
tian and you live, I woul
d chose either side.  
You know, it™s like, you know, always like in Spain, when you had–.

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape one, side B of 
an interview with Abe Jakubowicz. 
 You were saying about religion– 
 

A: Yeah, until then, you know, it did not, I knew wher
e I belonged.  I like to help the people, 
because I know what this is.  But it was not late
r on, the ma in.  I suffered because of it, but it was 
not my ma in thing, you know.   
 

Q: You me ntioned that when the war started, that
 changed.  Did your feelings about religion, about 
God change? 
 

A: No, what had changed is that you couldn™t goin the Synagogue no more.  Because they caught 
you, you know, they shoot you or they shot you or they did some thing to you or they beat you up 

if you was lucky.  So, we were scared.  So– it 
did not change.  I believed certain– if you ask 
me  now, I think God is for everybody.  There is no 
such a thing about being closer or not.  We ™re 
having to live together a
nd if you try to separate yourself, yo
u end up like in Yugoslavia.  Can™t 
do it.  There™s not a Jewish God, there™s 
not a Catholic God.  It™s a God, you know. 
 

Q: Did you think about, I mean at this point, wh
en the war is well underway– at the time you were 
in Starachowice, you were separated from your 
entire family.  You didn™t know whether they 
were alive.  Did you feel, did you think at all 
about your spirituality, your relationship with– 
 

A: Number one at that time, is su
rvival.  You want to survive, rega
rdless.  You want to survive.  
You ask yourself, ﬁWhy me , oh Lord? ﬂ   You know. 
 But you want to survive, you know it, that™s 
all what it is.  Like an animal, 
we become simply like animals, you 
want to survive.  Only certain 
people would do more to survive and certain peop
le would do less, some thing different, but we 
all want to survive. 
 

Q: So, there wasn™t the time  or the 
experience for that kind of questioning? 
 

A: No, we did not, no, there was not. 

 

Q: Is there anything else you wa
nt to say about Starachowice? 
 

A: In Starachowice, when we saw the Russians 
came  too close, and there was already a train 
standing.  We  did not know where we are going.  
We  thought we all will be liquidated.  So, we 
saw a lot of them, ma ybe 50 people.  So that
– and we run always, you know, a place, and we 
run away.  I– some  they went with machine guns. 
 A lot of them got caught.  I happened to be, 
but I didn™t get shot by the machine gun.  And bei
ng there one night, two nights, you need to eat, 

you have to get some thing.  There was very big forest they called 
Lasisvindikshe
 
(ph)
, very big 
forest.  And then I came , I saw a hut standing th
ere.  And I thought ﬁOkay, I™ll try,ﬂ and I go in.  
And when the guy saw me , he said, ﬁHey,ﬂ he sa
id, ﬁJew.  You™re a, you know, really, you™re a 
Jew.ﬂ  ﬁWai t a mi nute, because when the Germans come  they will shoot me.ﬂ  But he went on 

the street and he saw the German pol ice.  But this is military police, you know, they directed 

already, you know it– brought ‚em in.  So Abe, now
 you™re at the end of it.  He says, ﬁOkay, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
12
 
 
12
where did you run away? ﬂ  Li sten, he didn™t know it. 
 I said, ﬁI was in this camp, and we all, we 
get, you know–ﬂ  He says, ﬁIt™s goo
d.  I will take  you there back.ﬂ 
 
Q: Tell me  again who this was?   What nationality this person wa s? 

 

A: Pole.  He was a Roma n Catholic
, or whatever it is, but
 not Jewish.  And I went to the– so, they 
took me  in to– and luckily I told you this En
ischma nn.  All day he ta
lked– he says, ﬁOkay, 
we™re going now to–ﬂ He knew already we™re
 going now to Auschwitz.  ﬁ Why now do you 

want to shoot him?   We  t a ke him with us.ﬂ  And then I went to Auschwitz.   
 

Q: So, you were deported with En
ischmann and the five other boys? 

 

A: Yeah.  But I was not with them.  Thi s  is his pr
ocess.  I don™t know what car they went, but we all 
went to Auschwitz. 
 

Q: So when you were deported from Starachow
ice to Auschwitz, you weren™t necessarily with 
people that you knew and were close with? 
 

A: No, you just, you are a number.  You are not– 
it was ma ybe a hundred people in a train.  You 
know, ma ybe you thought you were– And they™d say, 
ﬁGet out, get!  Get!  Get!ﬂ You know, so 

you were scared.  No, I could not see him anymor
e in Auschwitz, either.  Some how I got away 

from the m. 
 

Q: When you look back on that time, to me  some thi
ng that really is striking is that you had been– I 
get the impression you were such a close-knit fa
mily and your fa mily was all de pending on each 
other and counting on each other.  And all of a s
udden, you are thrust, you™re 
just thrust 
into this 
independent and solitary–. 
 

A: Then it takes over some thing else.  You want to 
survive to tell it to th
e other people.  I didn™t 
care to survive, but they would tell me, ﬁListe
n Abe, you will survive.ﬂ  For one year, until it was 
fine.  That such an atrocity happened.  I owed 
it to my parents.  I owed it to– it takes over in 
your body, the will to survive.  And if you have to 
crawl, if you have to eat some thing, you have 
to do it, you will do it.  And when you are younger, you got a better chance.  Say you stood 

near– if they want to shoot some body, it wa
s you, it was you.  There was not anymore– you 
know.  Sometimes it™s luck, too. 
 

Q: Uh huh.  But it was almost, it was as if this 
whole different pe rson, you became a whole different 
person. 
 

A: A whole, completely different person.  But 
later on, it™s a funny thing, 
when I was liberated, I 
was the same me , you know.   
 

Q: So you left Starachowice, according to what
 you said before, around March 1944, as a ballpark 
guess of when you left.  And then–  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
13
 
 
13
A: ‚44, that™s right.  Because when the Russians ca
me closer– yeah, it™s a ballpark.  I don™t even 
know it, but it™s probably, it is.  
It™s probably in
 the ballpark. 
 
Q: And you described your journey 
and you described arriving in Ausc
hwitz and being taken to the 
Gypsy lager. 
 

A: Gypsy camp.  They did not ma ke selections, b
ecause they saw all these people worked and they 
needed at that time , they needed workers.  A
nd a lot of Hungarian Jews came in that time  and 
mostly they put them in D camp. 
 So, since they didn™t have any pl
ace, they put us for a while in 
the Gypsy camp. 
 

Q: Did you have any interactions at all w
ith the gypsy fa milies that were there? 
 

A: Yeah.   

 

Q: Can you describe what kinds
 of interactions you had? 
 

A: You went out and you saw there was whole fa m
ilies living, you know it, and they had a curtain, 
not a curtain, just a blanket, you know it.  And he
re was this fa mily, there was that family and 
that was as fa r as the interaction.  Because bei
ng there a few days, they liquidated all the gypsies 
in that camp.  At night you hear the cars, you 
know, going back and forth, trucks taking them to 
the crematory.  But it was three days and I came 
over to the family and everything is fine.   
 

Q: Had you known at that point that the Nazis we
re exterminating other 
groups than the Jews? 
 

A: Oh yeah, sure.  Yeah, we knew it.  I knew if
 you wasn™t their way, they exterminate you.  But I 
didn™t know before that they took the Gypsies. 
 You know, only when I was in Auschwitz, I saw 
that they disa ppeared.  I knew where they went. 
 

Q: Did the Jews in the lager and the Gypsies gene
rally interact with one 
another?   Talk to one 
another? 
 

A: We spoke, yeah, we spoke, but that is it, as fa
r as it went.  In the first few days, we were in 
quarantine.  We didn™t go to work.  We stayed th
ere.  You were afraid to go far.  They catch 
you–.But yes, you get to talk to some  of the m.  Th
ey said their son is on the front, works for the 
Germans, makes ditches, you know.   
 

Q: And then you described how you started work
ing with the Ca nada commando.  And I wondered 
how it was that you got that position, because
 that was a somewhat coveted position. 
 

A: No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it.  Usuall
y when you stand, you know, I worked that time 
before I worked in katowe bunker 
(ph )
, you know, where the potatoes was.  And you had to, 
there was two people, one in front and one in the 
back and then they filled it up.  You lift it up 
and you go to other pl ace, you know, and filled it, put
 it in there.  Because mostly when they 

came with the railroads, they dumpe d it.  And I 
knew one thing, there was always selection going 
on.  There was selection to go in 
the crematoria if you didn™t look good 
or if they didn™t like you.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

14
So, you always watched out.  Your eyes went th
e right way.  Some how I 
mi ssed hi m.  He was 
standing in front of me .  And he said, write 
down here the number.  
You know, my number what 
I got right here on my hand.  He wrote it down 
and they called me  out.  I didn™t know where 
we™ll go.  You know, nobody wanted to work in 
two different places.  Sonderkomma ndo, where 
what the people burned them, you know it.  And 
Canada, where you take the clothes.  You told 
them, ﬁOh you will live, and it™s nothi ng,ﬂ whol
e kind of thing, ﬁTake off, when you come  out, 
you will find it.ﬂ  You know, we had to take it awa
y, and they sold it.  But this me ant a certain 
death, too.  Say, sonderkomma ndo ma ybe three mont
hs, the other one ma y be six months.   
 
Q: Well, it™s interesting to hear you say that 
nobody wanted it, because I™ve heard other people say 
that it was, that they would try to get a positi
on, because you would have 
advantages of clothing 
and food and so forth. 
 

A: Now, you had advantages, but you di dn™t want  
to, because you knew that you would be dead, 
too.  And you always have that little hope, you 
know?   They did not, they
 picked you, you didn™t 
pick them.  They picked me  out.  And I said, 
ﬁOh,ﬂ you know it.  No, I didn™t like it.  I had a 
little bit of food, but then I had to wa tch 
out.  Some body would see me  shoving it down my 
mouth, they would kill me , and all these things. But in a way, this food helped, but I didn™t want 

to, no.  So I was in Canada.  It™s 
like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando. 
 

Q: Did you have friends in Auschwitz? 

 

A: Friends what I knew only, I me t them in the ca
mp, but nothing else.  Friends, but I slept with 
them, but no, you did not have friends.  You didn™
t have nothing.  What 
binded with them, they 
all had a mi serable life, but that was it.  N
o, I did not have nobody.  
Some  brothers stayed 
together, or even high manageme nt ma ybe st
ayed ___________.  I did not.  Some how I, I got 
away some how.   
 
Q: Okay, back to the summa r y.  Some thing that you me
ntioned in the first inte
rview that I wanted to 
ask you a little bit more about– you me ntione
d that God was watching over you. Did you feel 
that at the time  that God was watching over you? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: No, I felt later on when I saw all the deaths, that
 he was watching over me .  In fact, the opposite.  
I always ask, you know, ﬁ Why me , oh Lord?ﬂ  You know, to have suffered.  And a lot of people, 

you know, they  was weak, they grabbed the electric
 wire.  If I had guts I would have done it, but 
I have no guts to do it.  But no, no.  Later when I see so ma ny dead, I say probably God was 

watching over me .  This is what saying about God. 
 

Q: So, about September 1944 you were sh
ipped to Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
15
 
 
15
A: That is right.  And there we
 stayed about two weeks, I thi
nk.  And that was a quarantine, you 
know, it was near Berlin.  In fact, we saw, you know
, we were in a station in Berlin and there 
was bombing, all things.  It was alrea
dy going, you know, everything going strong.   
 
Q: And I was a little confused about what happene
d next.  I heard some thing– either you went to 
Ohrdruf or you went to Krauwinkle 
(ph )
? 
 

A: At first we went to 
Krauwinkle.  Krauwinkle was a little sm
all place, you know it?   But then we 
had to build this big pl ace for 
all the people to come, because 
we built the tunnels, you know, in 
the mountains.  So Krauwinkle was, yes, 
Krauwinkle was a ve ry, very small pl ace. 
 

Q: How long did you stay there? 

 

A: It all went fast, about a w
eek, two.  I reme mber it was so co
ld in the mountains, you know.  I 
reme mber we had to go so far, to the mountains, to 
drill and do this here.  In fact, at time s they 

didn™t have a lot of SS guarding us Œ it was a 
volkstrom
 
(ph )
, was an old man.  Al mo st as old as 
me .  And they guarded us. 
 

Q: And did you do some thing, taking care of a dog? 

 

A: Yeah, when I was, late in– was it Ohrdruf or
 was it Krauwinkle?   I had an SS guy ask me  to 
take care, really it was not to ta
ke care of the dog.  Really it
 was to ma ke  chopped wood for his 
wife, if she wanted something to do, you know it. 
 But beside there was a German She pherd, he 
told me  to, you know, fe ed him too, and this wa
s just caring for the dog.  So he gave me  
permission to go in the SS kitchen, you know a
nd pick up all the bones.  But everything was 
edible, so you can imagine.  I always got beat 
over by the dog.  He gives him so muc h food, and 
he™s so skinny.  ___________. (laughing) 
 

Q: But you got a little bit of
 extra food by doing that? 
 

A: Yeah, you got always a little.  Not from hi m– th
e food what I got in the SS kitchen that I could 
steal.  Nobody gave you anything extra, you know.  
Extra you had to take. Wa s it in Krauwinkle?  
You see he picked them– you know
, in that time they told 
me , if you let yourself go, you don™t 
wash yourself, you go down very fast.  And I didn™
t want to go down fast.  And also our hopes 

for the war, it™s winding down.  I only thought th
ey would shoot us before– you know it.  So, 
probably I was maybe cleaner like near the time. 
 You know he said that
 I should take care– 
you know, for his wife, and other things.  
 

Q: So, you found ways to wash yourself through that time ?  

 

A: Yeah, you go and, washings, you know, it was co ld, but they want you to wash yourself, you 
know it.  So, what I did, I did.  The other ones we
re afraid, you know, it™s cold, they didn™t want 
to, not all of them, ninety percent washed. 
 It™s only when your mi nd goes down, your body goes 
with it.  Your feet start swelli
ng and you give up.  You can know it. 
 So in that time I didn™t give 
up yet.

Q: When you were in Auschwitz and the other camps  before–? 
 

A: I still tried to maintain, you know
, as much as I could to be clean, because otherwise they would 
put you in the selection, 
to the crematoria.   
 

Q: How did you– was it difficult when you were 
in Auschwitz to obtain water to clean? 
 

A: No, no, no.  We got, there was a shower, only 
you went in, you know, you were supposed to 
wash a little bit.  It  was not diffi cult.  In fact 
they didn™t want any sickne
sses to break out either.  
They cut your hair, pick lice a
ll around your arm.  No, I could 
wash, it was not that hard to 
shower, but they took us so
 we could wash ourselves. 
 

Q: After you arrived in Ohrdruf, you st
arted to build a camp, build the camp?  

 

A: That™s right, we started build
ing the camp.  The c a mp to Treb
linka, no to Krauwinkle, we went 
and built the camp.  And then they moved us over into the– 
 

Q: And then you described that, your time  in Ohrdr uf 
in the first interview.  And then in February 
1945, around, around then, you set out on a de
ath ma rch towards Buchenwald.   
 

A: That is right.  The Ameri
cans came closer, that™s right. 
 

Q: And you talked about how you thought you woul
d die before you arrived in Buchenwald. 
 

A: That™s right.   

 
Q: And the Dutch prisoners, Jewish prisoners helped you. 
 

A: I assume d it was Jewish prisoners, maybe not.  
It was Dutch people.  I 
knew that they spoke 
Dutch.  And they dragged me  in to Buchenwald. 
 

Q: It™s kind of rema rkable how there were cert
ain key points where people,
 pe ople were there for 
you. 
 

A: It was, if they could help me , I was too.  Lo
t of time s I was younger than an older ma n, if there 
was some thing to do, I tried to do it, too.  You 
tried, you know?   You didn™t lose your huma nity, 
you got a sense of survival, but if you knew it™s 
a danger, you stayed away.  But if you could 

help some body you were there.  Because I was, when I was in Ohrdruf, we went, there™s a city 

called Arnstadt and we had to ma ke ditches, becaus
e they laid cables.  And there happened to be 
a Jewish guy, much older, and he told me  he wa s head of one of the Jewish bigger newspaper 

from Heit 
(ph)
.  He told me , you know, and we talked and 
I tried to help him as much as I could.  
Whenever there is an older person with who hi
s work was pen and pencil, wasn™t as good at 
ditch digging, you know, to dig th
e ditches.  You know, and I was a young kid, and you learn.  
Not that I was better, but I tried to le
arn much better than an older person.

Q: Did you, you talked in the first interview about
 being in Buchenwald 
and recovering and about 
how at first you were in a horribl e place,
 and then you walked out of there. 
 
A: That is right.  When they brought me  to Bu
chenwald, they dumped everybody.  No shower, no 
kind of thing.  This guy came to me , this Kapo an
d he said, ﬁWhat you got?   You got diarrhea?   
You got stomach, you c a nnot control your bowel move
me nt?ﬂ  I say, ﬁIt™s okay, it™s fine.ﬂ  He 
said, ﬁGo in here.ﬂ  There was a place about five
 and I got on top, got the 
place he told me to lay 
down– 
 

Q: Fivebunks? 

 

A: Ya, ya, so I was there, but I thought, my gosh, if
 I have to survive.  Here™s a death, here™s a 
death, smells horrible.  And I went down and I 
told the guy, ﬁHey listen, 
I™m nice and clean, but I 
don™t really do such things.ﬂ  
In the meanti me  always when, 
simples Juden ein treiden (ph)
, all 
the Jews should go because they put them on march.  I said, ﬁMy gosh, I cannot go, they have to 

shoot me , let them shoot me  here.ﬂ  And I ignored 
it.  And they needed a few clean people.  They 
had a small place where girls worked and they ne
eded a few cleaners, because they wa nted to 
keep for the SS some  woma n, you know?   So they 
put me  in there and I was liberated there.  

That place was a little bit cleaner. 
 

Q: What were the nationalities of 
the wome n who were 
kept there?    
 

A: Oh, this was prisoners, but mostly they spoke German.  But they was prisoners.  But they keep 
them, you know, as nurses for the people that work
ed there.  But this was only to pretend, to 
show, you know, it was not– 
 
Q: It was a kind of brothel, you me ntioned. 
 

A: That™s right, part of a brothel. 

 

Q: And how did they, can you 
say how business was undertaken? 

 

A: No, I was there in that time .  
I was r eally sick.  Then Americans they say they come.  And they 
probably went, whatever it is.  I 
don™t know it.  I would have had to
 invent it, but I don™t know it. 
 

Q: You don™t know whether they were forced into the– 

 

A: They were forced, ya, su
rely, yes they were forced. 
 

Q: At that time, you, were you 
so sick it was hard for you 
to even get up?   Or how–? 
 

A: I couldn™t get up.  I could really not– I was,
 when I came into Buchenwald I had already 
diarrhea by myself.  I had to r
un.  And after a while if you have nothing behind, you get weaker 
and weaker.  But I was– in fact
 after the liberation it took abou
t six weeks, six months, until I 
could learn to walk again.  So, when the American
s came, I couldn™t walk.  They told me  that the 
Americans are there, but I–  And there were tw
o Polish guys with me .  Got still some  pictures

from the m.  They brought me a little bit food, th
ey brought me that, you know it?  They could 
move better than I could.
  I couldn™t move.   
 
Q: Do you remember when the Americans came into the camp? 

 

A: Oh yeah, I reme mber, it was, you know it.  But th
at was the eleventh of April.  But probably a 
little bit later, but th
en you saw the people came and took pi
ctures.  You know, ironically today, I 
went out with a guy on 
Shoah
, he spoke as a liberator.  And he came to Buchenwald one day 
later that  it was liberated.  
He™s Mr. Knight, his son happene
d to be an opthamologist.   
 

Q: You went out with him today? 

 

A: Yeah, I went out today.  He™s 81 years, with hi
s wi fe.  And we  went out to eat some thing.  I say, 
ﬁHey you liberate me , I go and meet.ﬂ 
 

Q: Have you been in regular contact with him?  

 

A: I met hi m only– no, I met hi m when I went first time to 
Shoah
.  And he spoke how they 
liberated Buchenwald.  And then I went to him. 
 I say, ﬁHey, I was one what you liberated.ﬂ  So, 
I give him my telephone number and he gives me  
his telephone number.  So, we happened to go 
out today. 
 

Q: So when you say you went to 
Shoah
, what do you mean? 
 

A: Once in a year, it™s a me morial for the Holocaust survivors.
1
 
 
Q: Here in Louisville? 
 

A: In Louisville, it™s everywhere.  And the last
 few times, he™s always picked me , but you cannot 
always pick the next, the same  pe
rson to speak.  First you hear it, a
nd then it gets like old coffee.  
So, last time , I didn™t, they did it differently.  
But I had got to light the 
candle and all the things, 
yeah.  And this guy spoke as a liberator from 
Buc henwald, but I didn™t know hi m before, you 
know.  So, we went out today. 
 

Q: How did that go? 

 

A: Oh, it was nice, you know, my gosh.  I onlywished we came in ________Œ when I was sick and 
was liberated, people came  with ca
me ras and the press and everythi
ng and ma de pictures.  I wish 
I would find some where a pictur e from me, because 
I™ve got at least thousa nds of pictures what 
they made.  But I didn™t get it.  I™m still look
ing.  My wife says, ﬁWhy do you watch it? ﬂ  I say, 
ﬁI want to recognize me  some where.ﬂ  (laughing) 
 

Q: Did you talk today with him about–?

A: Oh yes.  He was as much interested as I was. 
 He told me  wha t  he was, he was a platoon leader 
and he was in We i mar.  Wei mar is, I think seve
n kilome ters from Buchenwald.  So, he had to 
buy some  things, so he went with 
a jeep and drove in there and wh
at he saw.  You know, so we 
talked about it, yeah. 
 

Q: Was he Jewish? 

 

A: No.  No, he™s not, but you don™t have to
 be Jewish in order to see it, you know? 
 

Q: You were, you rema ined in Buchenwald 
then for how long after the liberation? 
 

A: Oh, I did not stay in Buchenwald very long.  
I stayed ma ybe a  month, or ma ybe three weeks and 
then the next little, tiny city was Blankenheim.  
They evacuated schools and they put us in there, 
you know it.  I reme mbe r  a room like this, who k
nows how many beds.  And most of them, they 

give bread to each one.  It was plenty, but they di
dn™t want  to give, because they was afraid they 
will die.  So, she gave me bread and the other on
es couldn™t eat it.  So sometimes I ate twenty 
pieces of bread and– ﬁOh!, you will get diarrhea 
and you will die.ﬂ  I tell you I was only one 
from fe w that survived.  I got 
the diarrhea and surviv
ed.  (Laughing.)  But I gained every week, 
about five pounds.  And they were all the meat– 
I couldn™t walk.  They had to teach me  how to 
walk and to go.  So I was in Blankenheim.  Ir
onically, now let™s go farther, one of the doctors, 
Doctor Lucas, I me t him later on in Fr ankfurt and 
he was head from TB hospital.  And I had TB, 
so we became  really close friends, you know, he alwa
ys took care.  I reme mber when he me t this 
girl and he want– you know, he told me , ever
yone around.  There was a bond because he saw 
how I was. 
 

Q: And you did me ntion him–

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interv
iew with Abe Jakubowicz.  Sorry, we got cut off and 
you were just saying that he was a German prisoner of war.   
 

A: Prisoner of war, that™s right.  And they got a 
lot of doctors, German pr
isoners of war, so his 
nurses, they were Germa n prisoners of war.   
 

Q: Did you– so some  people, of course, feel that 
the German na tion as a whole was responsible for 
what the Nazis did to Jewish pe
ople.  The fact that you were ab
le to befriend this ma n, who was 
a German, non-Jewish man. 
 

A: I say the German was responsible, but I didn™t say that every German killed or a German hated.  
Fact is, you know it, it wa s their __________, you know
 it.  But I think there™s some good and 
some  bad in every nation.  And I believe, first, 
life is too short to hate.  Secondly, I believe if I 
teach my kids to hate, so me body will hate them and 
it is a vicious cycle.  The cycle has to stop.  
And my mother always told me , ﬁYou know Abe ,
 if some body throws a rock at you, throw them 
bread back.  Take a piece of bread and throw 
them back, don™t hate.ﬂ  You know, so I– even 
when I was liberated, I wa nted to te
ll my story, but I didn™t hate.  
It™s wrong to hate, I can™t.  I 
think that people what hate, they
 are born– as you see now in Y
ugoslavia, they take kids, for 
two year, __________ throw them down ___________, and th
e training, and the ditch.  It takes a 
special person, but everybody can do it.   
 

Q: So, you weren™t angry even
 then?   Were you angry? 
 

A: I was angry, but I didn™t hate. 
 I was angry at the SS.  I was a
ngry, but never hate.  I think they 
should be punished, what they did, but not hated. 
 In fact, my wife is German, you know.  I say 
you can™t ma ke everybody responsible for some thing.  But then I would be the same  thing like 

Hitler, he said all the Jews are bad.  Maybe some 
of them were.  It ™s like now in Russia, I saw in 
today™s paper, the anti-Semitism.  Because they bl ame the Jews for what™s going on now, and 

Jews had nothing to do– there™s only a few of 
them.  The difference is, now the Jews have a 
way, they can run away.  I couldn™t.  And I would run for my l i fe, but I couldn™t.   
 

Q: What was the name  of the doctor again? 

 

A: Lucas. 

 

Q: Did you talk with him at a
ll about any of 
these issues? 
 

A: Yes, we talked a lot about it, because he saw 
and we became good friends.  Certain things I tried 
to avoid, I didn™t want to bring up things, you 
know, because I knew it will not he lp me and it 
will not help him.  He had already his opinion formed. 
 

Q: What kind of things di
d you not want to bring up? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
21
 
 
21
A: Oh, the cruelty, because he sa
w it.  Why try to win if there™
s nothing there to win, you know?   
He knew it, he saw it, so certa
in things I tried to avoid. 
 
Q: What was his point of view that he shared with you? 

 

A: No Ger man will tell you that he agreed, they onl
y got forced to do it.  But I knew he got forced 
to do it, you know.  He was too smart.  He was 
not in the SS.  He was a good person.  Certain 
people, even when you are good, you can™t do noth
ing about it.  He was good in my book.  He 
was a very nice person.   
 

Q: It strikes me  as very unusual that you were ab
le to separate your ange
r from your hatred and to 
have meaningful relationships with– 
 

A: You have to, otherwise, you become  very bitter.
  I have a lot of frie
nds, you know, friends from 
there.  They are bitter.  A
nd it doesn™t help you really.  A
nd if I go around and be me an and 
mi streat other people, would my mother want me  to
 see this way?   No.  So I have motive to show 
that you are not the same .  You have to be different
.  I am different.  I would force mys e lf more 
to be mean, you know, than that is my nature.  You know. 
 

Q: Did you have friends or acquain
tances who were Jewish, at th
at time , who couldn™t understand 
why you would want to be friends? 
 

A: Oh yeah, I had, especially when I ma rried my
 wife.  They was against– they say, you know it, 
ﬁHow can you do it? ﬂ   I sa
y ﬁListen, I  go to them, 
they are very nice, th
ey open the door.  I™m 
sick, so money doesn™t play any part.  I me t th
e most beautiful person a
nd now this ma rried to 
me .ﬂ  ____________.  Here she was a young girl, good-
looking, and at the time, I tell you the 
truth, looking back now, I needed some body.  I 
r eally needed some body.  You know, I was not 
the one what could live alone.  You know it.  And 
it was nice.  And then when we went out.  And 
I would be cruel and leave her.  And only because  sh
e, it was nice.  Then I leave her out.  Then 
the Germans later on will say– you know it.  So it™s
 again another thing, Iwould have to think a 
lifetime on it.  And I tell you, we ar
e 52 years ma rried, we had all th
e kids college graduate.  We  
never had any problem about the 
religion, about other things.  I 
think our ma rriage has evened 
out.   
 

Q: Did you, you were in the TB hospital for– 

 

A: Ya, this is where the Dr. Lucas was head of it, the TB Hospital. 

 

Q: Okay, going back to the summer, you were in Blankenheim first– 

 

A: Ya, and then the Russians came in.  And I coul
dn™t stay with the Russi
ans.  They ask you why 
you don™t go home .  They thought because I murdered some body.  You know, therefore I don™t 

want to go.  I told them everybody got kille
d.  So I _____________ away.  There were a lot of 

Jewish guys.  We  went to the railroad, we dr
ove to Berlin, and from Berlin we drove to 
Frankfurt.  You know we came 
over in the American zone.

Q: Before you go on from there, regarding your statement that you knew you didn™t want to go back 
to Poland because everybody had been killed. 
 
A: I just thought everybody was dead. 
 It was a ceme t ery.  I™m sorry. 
 

Q: Did you get definite news at that point a
bout your father and your brother and your mother? 

 

A: You ask, that™s true, you ask.  In fact, when 
I came to Berlin and it 
was all the troops from 
everywhere, from Russia.  And there was a guy, he 
exactly looked like my father.  And I want to 
believe and I asked him.  I just direct asked him,
 you know it.  Surely it was not, but I wanted to 
believe it.  You know, I didn™t know it.  I found out
 later on from people what were with him, 
that he died in 1945 in Dora, you know, not far 
away from where I was.  Maybe the mountain 

was from the other side, but I didn™t know it. 
 He died in 1945, in the beginning of ‚45.   
 

Q: When did you find that out?   And from whom?  

 

A: I happened to be, you know, when you come  af
t e r the war, you ask everybody.  ﬁHey, you didn™t 
you see? ﬂ  ﬁWhere are you from? ﬂ   ﬁPiotrków.ﬂ
  ﬁPiotrków?   Did you know my dad? ﬂ  You 
know, because in Piotrków– and he said, ﬁYes.ﬂ  
In fact, this guy, his name  is Rappa port and he 
became a dentist in St. Louis.  He™s dead now, too.  But I found out in Rupertstein 
(ph)
, he was 
sick on TB, too. 
 

Q: And when did you learn about 
Treblinka and what Treblinka–? 
 

A: I knew this all, this I knew 
right away.  That the whole trans
port went to Treblinka.  When you 
went to Treblinka, it was death.  And I knew 
this, so I didn™t have to ask anymore. 
 

Q: Right away after the war,
 you mean?   Or right away–? 
 

A: Yeah, right away after the war.  In fact, 
I came late, because I was in Buchenwald, you know, 
and then I wa s in Blankenheim, in the hospital.  
So it was a few months after the war already.  I 
would say, we got liberated in April, ma ybe si
x months later, because
 I ha d to walk and I 
couldn™t walk right away.  I got 
there about six months, seven months.  Then it was awful cold 
and I didn™t feel good.  And I was coughing.  And I 
got x-rayed and they told me , ﬁAbe, you™ve 
got TB.  You better go to the hospital.ﬂ   
 

Q: And that was when you went to Rupertstein? You were in there for quite a while, weren™t you?  
How long were you there? 
 

A: I stayed in Rupertst ein until 1947.  
No, ‚57, ‚57.  I got ma rried in ‚47. 
 

Q: You stayed in the town? 

 

A: Ya, in town.  I was in hospital ma ybe two, I 
would say to about a few mo nths before I got 
ma rried.  End ‚46 or the beginning of ‚47.

Q: What did you, was that time , wh
at was that time in the hospital 
like?   We re you really sick and 
out of commission?   Or did you–? 
 
A: No, you were sick.  You felt good, TB doesn™t hurt you.  So all what in that time , now you got 
penicillin and streptomycin.  In 
that time , all what could help 
you, so ma ny people died– in fact, 
a lot of people what I wasn™t there was liberat
ed, they died.  You got 
to lay down and breathe 
fresh air.  It was high in the 
mountains.  They give you decent 
food, and that was it, you know.  
Mother Nature in that time  had to help.  So 
certain people didn™t ma ke it– because a lot of  
people years ago died on TB. 
 

Q: So, during your, what did you do to keep 
yourself busy and occupied during that time? 
 

A: Well, we went in the village.  Really a lot of
 people weren™t supposed to go, because there was, 
they call it, plus and mi nuses.  If you got the baci
llus and you don™t have it,
 but you still had TB.  
I could, because, you know– but a lot of people 
had it and we nt any way, because the Germans 
at that time  would not stop you, you know.  So, we
 went in the village.  I got some – from 
UNRRA, United Refugees– anyway we got some  pack
ages and we traded.  I couldn™t eat, how 
much sugar can you eat?  So, we traded for some
 different things, you know.  Some  had fruits.  
You know, it was a village more, you know it, we 
traded with the people.  We  got coffee, you 
know at that time coffee didn™t mean nothing to 
me , but to them it me ant a lot, you know.   
 

Q: You said some thing earlier about how when the war ended, you became again, the person who 
you had been before. 
 

A: That™sright. 

 
Q: Did you start to go to 
services in any way? 
 
A: There was not anymore services.  There was in
 Sa lzheim.  When I wa
s in Rupertstein, I was 
alone, you know, with a  few other people.  But 
I had, not a cousin, but a relative far away and 
he– Wi ndheim 
(ph )
.  He was liberated.  No, he ran aw
ay on papers that he™s a Pole or 
some thing.  So, we went, for the high holiday, he
 invited me .  And we went to the synagogue.  

Because there wasn™t a synagogue really, in Fran
kfurt everything bombe d out anyway.  It was in 
the Rochiltalay 
(ph )
 there was a me e ting where you could pray.  So, I went for the high holidays, 
but otherwise all what you want
ed really is to survive. 
 

Q: And after you, so you still felt, even after the 
war ended, that your ma in goal was survival for a 
time? 
 

A: When you are sick, you want to get well.  And if that™s not the goal, th
en you see, see a lot of 
people, they survived and they™r
e dying.  But you wanted to survive, you wanted to live.  I was 
only 21 years old, 20 years old.  But now I got sure
ly, the will to live is very, very strong.   
 

Q: Did you start to have, as you star
ted to recover and to feel health
ier, did you start to have other 
goals for what you wanted?   Or did you start to
 reme mber, have thoughts 
about the past?   What 
was going on inside? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004

A: In my brain? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: You know, from the beginning when I got better, 
then you know, you wa nt to live, you want to 
go to a dance.  You™re still young. 
 I me t my wife  and we got ma
rried, then you got children.  So, 
maybe I didn™t start it from the right side, but 
some ti me s time dictates 
it.  You know, certain 
people were different.  They firs
t want the career.  I wasn™t smart enough to do all that thinking.  
I become  a child again.  (laughing) 
 

Q: Can you talk about, more about mee
ting your wife and what that was–? 
 

A: How I me t my wife?   We knew a 
girl, a Jewish girl, and she was 
not quiet sick.  So, they had a 
house, and were rented the rooms th
ere for her.  Her name  was Lutia 
(ph)
.  And she happened to 
be from Lodz and my friend was from Lodz.  We
 always went there to see how she was doing.  
Nothing else, we want, you know it.  So, when
 I came, I say, ﬁMy gosh, that™s a good looking 
girl.ﬂ  But then you forget a lot of things.  
Oh look at this, he has all _________.  My wife– and 
at that time  girls played hard
 to get.  But when you talk 
a lot and you talk and you know– my 
goal was, not to stay in Germany, having childr
en and leave, ma ybe for Israel, ma ybe for the 
United States.  But since I had TB and I was sick
, Israel and the climate would have been very 
tough.  I was supposed to come  here in 1952, but 
my wife talked me  out.  She says, ﬁListen, 
these people want to go.  Look here we got the 
nice apartment. We  got everything to eat.  Why 
do you rush so much? ﬂ   So, I gave in and 
in 1957– was Hungarian uprising in 1956.  And I 
knew that™s the last way I can get 
out, and still I didn™t want to.  
But that™s the way we got here. 
 
Q: Was it difficult for you to live 
in Germany during those years? 
 
A: It was really not, because  the Germans are ver
y, very nice, even when what  they think is 
some thing different.  You learn to live with it
.  You know, if you have 
some thing, if you have a 
hunchback, you learn to live as a hunchback, you 
know.  (Laughing.)  You cannot go against a 

trend.  They was extremely nice.  
And then I thought I n
eeded a trade.  So, I went to work for the 
IG Farben.  And they sent me  to a school a
nd they taught me , you know, about the way.  So and 
the people saw and I worked with them, that I wa
s not different.  I was not what they had told 
them I a m.  You know, s o, no– in fact, when I wa
s supposed to go to the United States, I told 
them.  They said, ﬁListen, we give you a year 
leave of absence and if you don™t like it, you can 
always come back.ﬂ  And they ma de an album 
and everybody wrote something nice in it.  I am 
not a person what carries around hatred.   
 

Q: So, did you know when you started working for IG
 Farben, what their role, their history had 
been?   
 

A: Oh yeah.  I knew it, because I told you, I saw 
the Zyklon B, and all the gas.  In fact, near 
Auschwitz there was a, called Buna, they ma de ga
soline from coal.  And as far as I know it was 
conducted by IG Farben, too.  Yes, I knew it, but 
I had to– when you have to live, you have to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
25
 
 
25
live.  I want a trade, and then fi
rst things first.  And then it™s different.  You cannot kill before 
you™re dead.  (Laughing.)   
 
Q: But how ironic that they were, that IG Farben
 had Jews working as slave labor during the war 
and then you were working– 
 

A: That is right.  I worked there, because I wanted
 to learn a trade.  I cannot work physically hard 
anymore and there was– they paid me  good.  They 
were extremely nice.  They went out of their 
way.  And some times you have to take advantag
e, later on, you cannot forget, but you have to 
learn to forgive a little bit.   
 

Q: Did they know that you  were Jewish? 

 

A: Ya.  And I didn™t have to be ashame d 
then later on, you know. 
 Yes, I told them. 
 

Q: You didn™t experience any anti-Semitism fr om them? 

 

A: If it was, it was only behind my bac k.  They w
ouldn™t openly show it, n
o.  Germans are different, 
you know.  See, a Russian, if he is, he tells 
you.  And Ger ma ns will be very, very nice, you 
know.  The nicer they get, then you know
 you have to watch out.  (Laughing.) 
 

Q: Were you afraid, at all? 

 

A: Why would I be afraid
?  No, I wasn™t afraid. 
 

Q: You didn™t feel that there was a dang
er of any Holocaust happening again? 
 

A: In Germany now?   I will say Germany now is diff
erent.  I was there a fe
w times.  You got still a 
few, but they are, but most of them, they™re 
educated, they™re adaptable, you know.  They know 
it was wrong.  They know what Hitler– the olde
r ones.  All it brought them is, they couldn™t 

speak, they couldn™t do.  Now, they 
have a nice country built.  When
 we went to Israel, saw a lot 
of Ger man tourists.  They™re interested.  You know, sure they will always find– like anything 

else, here too, people would relate.  And no ma tter what, if some
body tells me  he hates blacks, I 
know right away he hates everybody, stay away, 
you know.  And I know it.  So, this type will 
always hate and you know why?   Because it™s an ex
cuse for their mi sery.  They will not say it.  I 
didn™t go to school because I was dumb.  If the 
Jews would not go, I would go there.  You know?   

It is the same thing.   What do you agree it is
 this way?   It does
n™t work the other way. 
 

Q: There was a Nuremberg trial, a case brought agai
nst IG Farben that came  to trial in 1947, 1948.  
Were you following that, interested in that? 
 

A: No, no.  ‚47, ‚48 I was still– you know, I just 
got ma rried.  I followed a little bit, you know, you 
always, but no.   
 

Q: When were you working for IG Farben? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
26
 
 
26
A: I was working in 1954, ‚55, ‚56 and ‚57.  But I tell you a story, while I was working for IG 
Farben and now when I retired, the German 
government couldn™t say I wa s not ________.  You 
get the SS the war years, they had to give me
 the war years, and I got a nice pension fr om 
Germany.  Beside being a Holocaust survivor, 
you know, because they had to give me  all the 
years.  And they cannot say, ﬁHey, we give an SS 
ma n.ﬂ  Say yes, wasn™t in the war, and while I 
was in concentration camp, I don™t ge
t it.  They had to pay me  back
 so much.  I said only I™ll try, 
but in this case they was very generous. 
 
Q: How was your relationshi
p with your wife™s fa mily? 
 

A: Oh, it was good.  They was not– really you know everybody can say, but then when you live so 
long, you see the history.  You know, they live in 
a little village, they mi nded their own business.  
They never knew Jews.  Maybe if they knew they
 would hate one, but they did not know, I know 
it. 
 

Q: Did they have an understanding of the extent of
 what had been done in the name  of Germany to 
the Jews of Europe? 
 

A: Oh ya, oh ya.  They tried those, a lot of them
 German– they tried to excuse and they didn™t do 
it.  I know a lot of them di
dn™t do it, but that™s the wa
y, what it was.  Yes.   
 

Q: So, they talked 
to you about it and–? 

 

A: We talked a lot about it, you know.  But they wa
s really, they ma ybe had to play the game , but 
nobody was in the Party.  And in 
a small village, everybody will ta
lk about you.  In a big city, 
you don™t know it.  All you had 
to do, is go to the neighbors and you know everything.  You 
know even what they cook.   
 

Q: Did you have friends who, you me ntioned some
thing earlier about how some  of your friends 
were saying you shouldn™t–? 
 

A: Yes, I was in the hospital with them.  They were my age.  A few of the m, ironically, came  from 
Blankenheim, you know, from– a fter we was liberate
d, they came with me in
 the same  train and 
we stuck kind of together.  He
 found out he had TB and I had TB, so we were kind of, there was 
a bonding.  If you have nobody, your friends become  
your relatives.  You™re bonding, it™s true.  
And we could speak openly, you know, that is thei
r opinion.  And I value their opinion.  I don™t 
say that they were wrong.  I really didn™t know
, ma ybe I was  mi xed up and didn™t know what 
was right or wrong. 
 

Q: Did they come  to  your wedding? 

 

A: Yes, yes, ironically they came to my wedding, 
too.  In fact, one was the best ma n, Trebletski 
(ph )
. 
 

Q: What kind of wedding did you have?

A: As little bitty as we could.  It was not very 
much.  We  went only to the Justice of Peace.  You 
know.  And he said, ﬁYou are ma n and wife.ﬂ  So, we
 ma de a little bit, what we could get at that 
time.  It was not very much.  But it was– lik
e the style you would say was very poor, but it was 
fine.  I got the bride anyway.  (Laughing.) 
 
Q: Right, that™s what ma tters.  Did you talk be
fore hand about, I imagine you did, about what you 
were going to do as far as religion? 
 

A: Well, sure.  My wife is not Je
wish.  And I figured with the kids
, it would not be fair for me  and 
she would not ma ke a good Jew anyway.  It is only because to please some body, like I would not 

make a good Catholic.  Doesn™t mean that I hate
 the Catholics, by no m
eans not.  But my kids 
got to choose what they want to.  Like Janet,
 she goes always on the hol
idays she goes with me  
to the synagogue.  And my oldest daughter, she li
ves in Barrington, in Chi
cago.  She does a lot.  
And what I™m mostly proud is that they™re all 
involved in the Holocaust
 survivors, the second 
generation.  They™re active.  It is 
not that they hate.  It
 is not to let people 
forget, look here what 
happens.  You cannot make it back.  I cannot turn
 the clock back.  But we can let the people 
know what hatred can do. 
 

Q: So, at that point, religion, which had been im
portant to you before the war was not as important 
to you– 
 

A: No, I saw what people, if they become  fanatic
.  And you start to put re
ligion in front, then you 
lose your sight.  You have to first see, and re
ally what™s good when you 
are religious and go pray 
and don™t live up to it.  I call them
 the hypocrites.  So you have to have it in the heart and nothing 
else.  And nobody can force you to be some thing. 
 If you don™t have it, you don™t have it.   
 
Q: Why did you want to leave Germany? 
 

A: Because I didn™t want my kids to be exposed an
ymore.  And truthfully, very trut hfully, I didn™t 
want them to get ma rried there and be there, you 
know?  I wanted them r eally
 to get away.   That 
is really my, to give you the best answer what I know, really. 
 

Q: So you didn™t necessarily feel fully tr
usting of Germany and the German people? 
 

A: Yeah, but, I feel trusti
ng, but if you get wounded, a s
car is there.  Okay?   I 
had the scar.  But that 
doesn™t mean that can function perfect yet.  Y
ou™ve got now a lot of Je
wish people that come  
from Israel, even, they live, a
nd a lot of them from Russia.  
You know, but for me , was too muc h 
experience and I didn™t want to 
rub salt in the wounds.  You know, 
I want to stay away.  Maybe 
it was the easiest way out. I don™t know it.  This is ju
st what I felt, you know.   
 

Q: Was talking– during those years just  following 
the war, was talking about what had, what had 
happened to you, and about your pa
st and about your feelings a
bout losing your fa mily– was 
that important to you?   And was it a 
critical part of 
your relationship? 
 

A: It is still very important to me.  In order to
 clear the air, you have to get everything on the table 
and then you can go on.  If you play a game , it will be 
st ill there.  Can™t do it.  So, yes it is fine.

In fact my wife now, ﬁ Why do you watch all that?ﬂ  I 
say, I still have to watc
h it.  It brings back 
bad me mories, but you still have to go on, and not 
forget it.  I will not forget it regardless, you 
know.   
 
Q: Did you have– I™m sorry, let me  stop and flip the tape.

Q: You mean both sides?   

 

A: Being here, and after liberati
on, how I felt– being a little boy–  

 

Q: Yeah, well, it™s so complicated, isn™ t it?  
To try to think of what came before, and what– 
 

A: Life is comp licated.  You know it.  You have 
only to learn to ma ke th
e best right away.  You 
have to learn not to let it go, let it get to you, 
the teflon me ntality, because otherwise you get 
soaked on with it, you know.  
 

Q: The which mentality?   

 

A: The teflon me ntality.  

 

Q: I thought that was what you said. 

 

A: You™ve got to, because ot herwise what are you going to do?   You know.  It™s pa rt of the Bible, 
too.   
 

Q: Well, I appreciate you taki
ng the time to do this.   
 

A: Any time, you know.  

 

Q: You just me ntioned some thing about other inte
rviews.  I wondered, have you been interviewed?   
Have you done other interviews besides–? 
 

A: Only for Shoah
2
.
 
 

Q: Uh huh, Shoah. 

 

A: And then came  a lady, she did inte
rviews for that, but besides she did it for herself, too.  So, I got 
another interview.  And then I had a fe w speeches
 for the– you know, when it™s the Shoah.  So I 
went and I spoke a little.  It is not as eas
y as you think, when you see so ma ny thousands of 
people.  And to show, you know, your pe
ople and show _________.  I can speak about 
everything, I have no problem.  But this is 
hard.  And then you don™t want to show your 

emotions.  The emotions come , you know it?   So you know, this was the– you have to do it, 

what you have to do.   
 

Q: Yeah, I wondered whether when you first started,
 when you first had the 
experience of trying to 
systematically tell the story of
 your experiences, whether that was a powerful experience for 
you?

A: It was.  It was for me  and it was for the othe
r people, too.  You know it.  Because, you know, it™s 
really nothing to ma ke you happy, basically, an
d nothing to be proud of, you know, it™s part of 
what you went through.  And you have to do it.  I to
ld myself in concentra
tion, if I survive and I 
can do some thing, I will go out and no
t tell the people, I will scream 
to the people.  But the real 
world is different. 
 
Q: You me ntioned that two of, was it two 
of your children were born in Germany?  

 

A: Ya, my oldest one. 

 

Q: What™s your oldest one™s name ?  

 

A: Bluma, is after my mother™s name.  Yeah, sh
e was born in 1948.  In July, no in June.  And my 
son is born in July.  His name  is Ben, you know 
it, and he was born in July, in 1954.  And Janet, 
the youngest is when we came to the United States
, my wife found out she 
is pregnant and then 
Janet, she wa s born here.  That was in 1957.   
 

Q: What ma de you want to come  to the United States? 

 

A: To get away and to be a free person, you know.  
To be free.  I knew always.  The United States, 
sure there™s people like KKK, 
you k now, but mo st people, they
 are not fro m here, they 
understand if some body is nice to me , what do I ca
re if he™s an Arab, or ________ but he™s nice 
to me .  Like my neighbor, Scotty, you know it, we
™ve already forty years to go.  And we always 
used to go, when we we re younger, together out.
  You know, so, it™s too 
much of a mixture to 
undo it.  And in Europe, you™ve got only two religions
.  Say, go to Ireland.  
It was Catholic, only 
one is Roma n Catholic and the other one is Protes
tant and they hate each other, you know.  So 
when you got a mi nority, you know, it™s only 
two, always will be the same  thing. 
 

Q: So, it appealed to you to come  to a pl
ace that had a real mi xture of people.   
 

A: That™s right, people understand 
different culture, that™s righ
t.  People are more tolerant. 
 

Q: Is that why the United States appealed
 to you mo re than Israel, for example? 
 

A: Israel appealed to me  very much, but first th
ing, you know, I was too sick. 
 I would have to stay 
much longer and then go to Israel.  And I knew in Israel I would have to work much ha rder and 

that the climate is much more, you know, it™s wa
rmer and hotter.  So, if I had, had another 
choice, I would go to Israel, yeah. 
 

Q: Did your wife have any feeling 
about where she wanted to be?    
 

A: My wife really wanted to stay in Germany.  
And I told her about the kids and everything.  She 
says, okay, then we try and if I don™t like it, you ca
n always go back.  The worst thing in life is 
when people don™t try.  And you don™t know, you 
don™t know your potential.  You don™t know 
nothing.  You have to be willing to take risk and 
try in your life.  And if
 it didn™t go right, don™t  
blame nobody.  Pick up the pieces and k
eep on going.  But that™s life things.

Q: Did you have relatives in the United States? 

 

A: Yes, I had relatives, but they was very, very 
far, you know.  From my gr andmother, had a sister, 
they lived in Philadelphia.  And when we came t here, they were so nice and they tried to help 

you.  But really, what you can help, is help 
yourself by doing– you know.  But they were nice, 
in fact, we correspond a lot, a long time .  He
 just died, he was 88 or some thing, you know, you 
get old.  He had two children.  In fact, his 
daughter came to visit us, you know.  I got now 
relatives.  I got a cousin and he came from 
Israel.  But still __________, from my grandmother, 
she had another sister and she went to Israel
.  The name  was Goldstein.  And after 1947, he 
wanted to study engineering here in the United St at
es.  And he really told me  in his mi nd was to, 
cooling systems, because they need– but when he came and he studied here, he went  to 

Berkeley.  He  got approached by the Bechtel 
Corporation, if he wanted to take atomic 
engineering.  He said, I don™t know nothing about it.  They say, we will put you through college  

and everyt hing.  So, he went and studied atomic e
ngineering.  In fact, he is now, he™s built so 
ma ny reactors, and you know?   And then he taught
 at Berkeley too for a while.  But even 
nowadays, retired– his name  is Golan 
(ph )
 now, from Goldstein changed.  He still likes 
_________, like– when it was in Russia, when the expl
osion was in the, what was name  is it?   
They went there to see what they can do. 
 

Q: Chernobyl? 

 

A: Chernobyl, ya.  So they still, like
 last week, he went to Paris, th
ey have all this, scientists.  In 
fact, two mo nths ago we went to visi
t him.  He lives in San Francisco. 
 

Q: What™s his first name? 
 
A: Simc ha.  Si mc ha in Jewish means happiness and the last name  is Golan from Goldstein.  Ya, he 
was here visiting.  You know, it™
s family, so we stay close. 
 

Q: How is he related to you? 

 

A: My grandmother had, she was the oldest and she 
had five sisters.  And one went to the United 
States, one went to Israel.  One,
 she lived in Lodz and went toge
ther  in the same  train with my 
mother and my grandmother to Treblinka.  And she 
left a son, he ran away.  She had a few kids, 
but they all went together.  He survived and 
he lives now in New York.  And one lived in 
Warsaw with the _________, he was Rudja 
(ph )
, he was the youngest one of them.  From these 
two, later on when you have no fami l y, you look and whatever you can find. 
 

Q: Did you know very muc h about the Un
ited States when, before you came here? 
 

A: I knew quite a bit, but what you knew as a boy, it
™s completely different, you know.  I read Jack 
London and had dreams and all kinds of junk, you know 
it.  It™s completely different.  But later 
on, I thought you know it.  A place if I would like to 
go.  I would like to go really to the United 
State.  And we spoke fairly a lit
tle bit English already.  We  knew 
more than the average.  When 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
32
 
 
32
we needed some  oil, we could buy oil and we di
dn™t come  home with vinegar.  (Laughing.) You 
know, __________. 
 
Q: So, your wife also didn™t 
speak very much English? 
 

A: Yeah, she didn™t speak very much, but we unders
tood.  We  took lessons.  
We prepared ourselves 
a little bit, because we ha d time.   
 

Q: InGermany ?  

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Did you have an idea of what
 you would do once you were here? 
 

A: No, I told you, I wanted to go in chemistry.  
But most of them, like here when I came, they 
couldn™t hire me , because I was a citizen– I was not
 a citizen.  So, I got my first paid job for a 
person who ma de glasses.  For a dollar an hour, and 
then it worked out and I liked it.  Now, we 
got the 20/20 Eye Care store.  We ™re doing very 
good.  If you feel you like it, you try it.  And if 
you don™t succeed, try it again, get stubborn.   
 

Q: What were your initial experiences or 
your first impressions 
of the United St ates? 
 

A: It was always– oh!  Wh en I got my first 
paycheck and, you know, you are not spoiled.  And you 
can buy so ma ny things.  And it™s a free worl
d.  We lived on, you don™
t know it here, St. 
Catherine Street, you know it.  And you hear 
the bells from the church ringing.  And the 
sunshine™s nicer when you like it, you know.  And 
we lived near a park and we took the kids to 
the park.  It was nice.  Yeah.  We  loved it right
 away.  Even if we di
dn™t have nothing, but we 
loved it. 
 
Q: But you didn™t come  straight to 
Louisville, right?   You were in–? 
 

A: I was fi rst in Philadelphia. 
 And in Philadelphia I didn™t lik
e it, only because my wife  got 
pregnant, was pregnant.  In Germany we had the 
best hospital, the best everything.  And since I 
worked for IG Farben, I could get anyplace, you know
 it, they had always.  And we had a nice 
home .  So it was an adjustme nt.  Like the ga
rbage emptied only one tim
e in a week and was 
standing around.  And we was in a 
hotel, very old.  The Gladstone 
(ph)
 Hotel, I remember this.  
We was ma ybe on the 17 or 20
th
 floor, but when you want to s
ee what kind of weather, you have 
to open the window, everything was dus
ty.  I didn™t care for it, particularly, but– I had this one 

friend, Colrink 
(ph )
.  And he says, ﬁAbe, if you want to 
come here, I™m working for Ford Motor 
Company.  I can get you there a job.ﬂ  So, I came to
 Louisville.  First I 
came and I said to my 
wife, ﬁIf I get the job, I gave you and, you know, ca
ll you up, and you come  with the kids.ﬂ  We ll 
even then you don™t react.  You™ve got all 
this luggage, pregnant, two kids, you know, 
____________.  But that was what we did.  So we stay
ed in– we came over here.  We rented an 
apartment.  And here it was different.  It™s a sm
aller city, everything was organized.  I worked for 
Ford Motor Company and at that time ma de a
bout 100 dollars a week.  My gosh, I could for ten 
dollars, load up so much groceries I c
ouldn™t even carry it,
 you know.  So.

Q: Did you have any knowledge about
 Louisville at the time ?   Or
 what you mi ght have expected? 
 

A: I didn™t even know that 
Louisville exist.  No. 
 

Q: So, you couldn™t have any pr
ejudices against it, then. 
 

A: No, I did not.  No, I did not.  But it™s still a ni
ce city.  People are nice.  
I like it.  In fact, my 
daughter, she went to Lexington.  She went 
to Law School.  She went to Le xington. 
 

Q: During this time  when you™re
 beginning to rebuild your life, 
did you take time to mourn what 
you had lost? 
 

A: No, you took later on.  Fr om the beginning, 
you couldn™t even tell 
nobody.  People wouldn™t 
understand it.  They thought that 
you are freaks.  They tried to st
ay away from you, you know it.  
You didn™t act like the people here.  In fact, 
it was hard on the kids, too, you know.  We didn™t 
speak any perfect English, you know.  It was har
d, but we knew that we 
would catch up.  First 
you have to have a footage and then you get ti
me .  No, not from the beginning, but later on, 
yeah.   
 

Q: When were you able to take time to do that? 

 

A: When I saw– I went to the Jewish Co mmunity 
Center.  We  took the kids.  Later on when I quit, 
not I quit, they quit me from Ford M otor Compa ny, 
because they laid off the whole second shift.  
And I went to work for dispenser Eli Jaffe 
(ph )
.  He was Jewish, so I c
ould at least speak with 
him.  How well you can speak to some body else.  S
o, it takes, it™s a slowly thing.  It doesn™t 
come  overnight.  It does not, you know.  And 
then you didn™t want to offend nobody.  You didn™t 
know how the people would react, you know. 
 

Q: Did people ask you about your experiences? 

 

A: If you don™t tell, nobody will ask me
.  And I didn™t tell from the beginning.  It™s only the last , 
you know, about ten years ago.  No, we went, ten y
ears, we went to Wa shington.  Holocaust.  So, 

ma ybe about 15 years, yeah.   
 

Q: And how wa s the Louisville Jewish community
?   Did you become  involved with people here?   
Jewish people in the community? 
 

A: Ya, I came involved.  But still, they in that time 
didn™t want to hear it ei
ther.  In order to find a 
listener, somebody has to listen, you know.  So, until later on when they found out that we are 

not lying, that such things exis
t.  A lot of people didn™t want 
to believe that such exists, you 
know.  So, it took a while.  I don™t know how 
long.  But I know it took a long time, you know.   
 

Q: So, when you me t people and they knew that yo
u were from Europe, they just would, they 
wouldn™t ask you where you came fr om, anything like that? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
34
 
 
34
A: No, no.  In fact, when you interview people now, 
they will tell you the same  thing.  They had a 
very hard time  to communicate 
with them, you know it.  Becaus
e you was different.  They had 
their problems, they didn™t want to hear my pr
oblems, even it was not a problem no more.  Still 
sooner or later, you know– it was not overnight. 
 
Q: It seems like that would have ma de it difficult 
to form relationships, trusting friendships.   

 

A: It was not.  Somewhere, I™m already better than
 90 percent, because I™m easy trusting, so I have 
no problems.  But a lot of them, they couldn™t trust,
 they still cannot trust.  And in fact, I cannot 
blame them.  They are different. 
 

Q: Did you start meeting people who were Holo
caust survivors in the Louisville area? 
 

A: Yeah, that wa s the first, you start to l
ook for somebody what you got something in common.  
And people what came mostly, you know, we call them the 
greenah (ph)
.  You know the green 
people.  That was the Holocaust survivors who ar
e, you know.  And then you want to show to the 
people that you aren™t a loser.  
That is not true, what they said, you know.  Then you try to work 
harder than the other one, you want to be better
 than the other.  You try to– you know it.  The 

kids didn™t understand it,
 but it was true.   
 

Q: So there was some  comp etition going on? 

 

A: Not between the other ones, no.  Between– I try to
 prove to the other world, that I am not really, 
one what they think I am, you know?   And thenyou™ve got a guilt feeling too.  They think, ﬁMy 

gosh he survived, how many people did he kill in 
order to survive?   How come  the other ones 
didn™t survive and he survived?ﬂ  So, there was a guilt feeling, too, you know.  How come  I 
survived? 
 
Q: You felt like people were judging you for surviving? 

 

A: I judged myself and other people judged me , too,
 you know it.  I must have been very bad, when 
the other ones didn™t survive and I did, you know
.  So, you got the double wha mmy.  (laughing) 
 

Q: Was there any kind of formal meeting 
of Holocaust survivor s in Louisville? 
 

A: No– they lived here and they tried to share, it
 was a little bit longer th
an I am, where they shop, 
and then we bought some records, from old countr
y.  Yiddish.  I still lik
e to listen to them, you 
know, and we for med a world within ourselves.  
But you cannot live in this
 world, because there 
is no walls.  And certain people th
ey still live with it, you know, they don™t speak much English.  
They don™t trust other ones.  And in this case 
I did much, mu ch better
 than the other ones. 
 

Q: How did you find the other people?  
 Was it through the 
Jewish community? 
 

A: Right, through the Jewish community center.  
And then when one found out, he told the other 
one, so you knew them r i ght away.  Word got very fast out. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
35
 
 
35
Q: So, were your meetings usually just one
 on one or did you ever gather at the–? 
 
A: Oh, we went to the Jewish Community Center, for example, you me t them there.  And if you 
liked some body, you invite them to your house or
 they invite you.  
You cannot like everybody 
the same  way.  God didn™t meant it to be this.  You know?   So me how the chemistry has to 

match. 
 

Q: Were you aware of other things 
going on in Louisville at
 the time that you moved here?   Such as 
Civil Rights move me nt? 
 

A: Oh yeah, I could read the pa
per and I read the paper.  And 
I was completely on their side, you 
know it.  Because it™s more than fair, those 
people.  In fact, I found out then, the German 
prisoners of war could go in places where they 
couldn™t, when they were fighting for the United 
States.  To me  it didn™t ma ke sense.  Oh yes, 
and the one thing about our kids, we do not hate, 
you know.   
 

Q: Did you see a parallel in the situ
ation, between the situation of 
the blacks in the United States 
and the Jews of Europe?   Of c
ourse, they™re not at all the same
.  But did you see the issue of 
racism as being– 
 

A: The Jews had the advantage in this case.  Because a lot of them don™t look like bl acks, so they 
don™t judge them, you know it.  So, if they want 
to beat up, it was first the black and then the 
Jew.  They didn™t hate him, they didn™t like
 him, but they didn™t know it, you know, what you 
did.  So– __________.  Yes, if somebody will come  to
 you and tells you, ﬁI hate blacks,ﬂ you 
know automatically he  will ha te you.  Or some bo
dy, I hate some thing for some  reason, then you 
know this man or this woma n put their mi nd on hating or  looking for excuses, because they are a 
failure and therefore they hate. 
 There is no reason.  If you want
 to be, it is an open country, you 
can do much better, work harder.  We  came 
in ‚57, you know.  In 1960, we bought the house.  
We worked hard.  We  couldn™t ma ybe have afford 
it in that time , oh I could afford later on mi ght 
be, but it doesn™t mean the kids– you know.  Bu
t, and if I say ﬁOoh, I™m
 living a lifetime here 
and can™t afford it.ﬂ  Yes, if you go out and spen
d your paycheck, then you can™t afford it.  You 
have to know it, what you got, and then they
 have a goal, what you want to __________.  Do I 
want to go and drink it away or do some thi
ng, you know, you can do it.  You have to balance 

your money. 
 

Q: Did you experience anti-Se mitism in Louisville at all? 

 

A: Really, really, no, you know.  At first here where 
I live there is no Jewish people.  No, I did not, 
to be truthful, no.  And in business, where I had 
a Jewish boss, or here when I do this.  I tell 
them, you know, I™m Je wish.  But they work for us, so I don™t think some body would go out 

and– no.  But we treat them right.  If we don™t gi
ve them a choice to be not to.  You know, we 

give them health care, and a lo
t of things.  I know what it m
eans to ma ke a very dedicated 
employee.  There is no one way street.  You 
cannot exploit some body and tell them I™m your 

friend.  It doesn™t work.   
 

Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood 
when you first arrived in Louisville? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
36
 
 
36
 
A: No.  I lived on St. Catherine Street, which wa
sn™t a Jewish neighborhood.  I tell you the truth.  
Sometimes it crossed my  mi nd, why don™t you go move
 near the Jewish Community Center.  But 
then I thought, you know what, sometimes it is be
tter when you stay away, even when you go up, 

you climb.  The higher you go, the more you can observe
.  You know it.  So I say if I wa nt to go, 
I can go there, I don™t have to live there, you know.  Back in the ghetto,they created their own 

ghetto.   
 

Q: Do you, how have you, how do you feel about liv
ing in Kentucky?   Do you, do you like it? 
 

A: It™s a very nice state.  An
d you got equal opportunity and it is 
not like a Southern state, now I 
know more about states.  
People are different here. 
 

Q: How are they different? 

 

A: They™re more tolerant.  They™re much more 
tolerant.  Some times in life you develop, some thing 
what you can judge already, called instinct.  I 
mi ght not be always right, but some times my 
instinct is right, you know.  So, I 
know it is in there.  If I go 
to New York, hustle, bustle, too 
much running, going to work so long and comi ng home , you have no time to spend with the 

fa mily.  Here you are right close to everything, y
ou have mor e time to spend with the family, I 
think.  To bring up children, regardless, Louisville is a nice city. 
 

Q: Do you travel around elsewh
ere in the state at all? 
 

A: Yeah.  We  got stores, you know, but this is stores
, but otherwise, yes.  We  go in state and out of 
state.  Yes, we do a lot of things.  But some time s I combine my work, you know.  We  got in 
Elizabethtown, a store, we got in
 Litchfield, a store, we got in
 Jeffersonville, a store, you know.  
We™ll go around and, you know, talk with the people. 
 See, I™m 75 years old already.  Have to be 
thankful for a lot of things. 
 
Q: You must enjoy your work a lot.   

 

A: I enjoy my freedom.  It is not so muc h the wor
k, as I enjoy talking to people.  And this what I 
like about uptakes 
(ph)
, you try their glasses, you can talk to
 them.  I always enjoy talking to 
people. 
 

Q: Do your employees know a
nything about your history? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Do they ask you about it?   

 

A: In fact, yes, a few times.  Some  of them ca me
 whe n I had, told them I™ m speaking, if you want 
to–  And everyone knows everybody and we got 
a lot of black people, they got to high 

positions, and they™re doing good.  To me, it is a pers
on.  Because we got he re in Fern Creek one 
and he is a very good employee.  And my wife s a ys, ﬁWhy do you take the ______________, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
37
 
 
37
and unfortunately people are prejudiced.ﬂ  Isaid, ﬁYou know I came from Poland.  They hated 
the Jews, but every Pole had his own Jew.ﬂ  Y
ou know, they come  and ask more for them, they 
ask for me .  You know, they™re good.
  What does they care, when they go out, and they see the 
glasses is good and he™s nice to them
, after a while they forget it.   
 

Q: And what do your employees think?  Do they
 tell you what they think of knowing some thing 
about your past? 
 

A: If you want to go this wa y, they all will beni ce, but I know deep insi de, you know what, I don™t 
give them a chance not to be 
nice.  I™m very nice to them. 
 

Q: They haven™t talked– have they talked 
to you directly about your
 Holocaust history? 
 

A: Some  yes, some  of the m didn™t, don™t even 
know the subject.  We ™ve got
 a lot of young kids, 20, 
25, you know, you cannot put it up on them anyway, even if I would want to, you know.  

They™ve got their struggles.  They
™re ma rried.  Especially now, 
when two people go to work.   
 

Q: Part of the reason I™m asking is that I think peop
le have in recent years, become  so mu ch more 
aware of the Holocaust.  And young pe
ople have become  so interested– 
 

A: I saw it on television and I thought so.  And they
 know my feelings,they 
will come  and tell me , 
yes, you know.  But otherwise I will not go there.
  If they do not approach me , I will not 
approach them. 
 

Q: What kind of responses have you gotten from 
people, when they™ve heard you talk, for example 
at the Shoah day? 
 

A: Oh, very, very nice.  People are different, you 
know, they got their own struggle.  And they see 
on television what you went through and now you™
ve got the Bosnia and you™ve got this.  So, 
you know it.  And now you™ve got in Russia, 
you™ve got a powder keg, too.  You know, so.

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number three, side A of an in
terview with Abe Jakubowicz.  When did you become  a  
citizen of the United States? 
 

A: After being five years here, 
exactly, you know it.  We  ca me  in ‚57, 1962.  Yeah, we didn™t wait 
very long.   
 

Q: Was that a si gnificant, 
important occasion for you? 
 

A: Very, very much.  Now you feel, you saw this, 
yesterday, Kruschev™s son became an American 
citizen.  And they asked him about it.  He said it
 is a big honor.  So, me  a poor, Jewish guy got it, 
it™s a very big honor, yes.  You know, yes.  
 

Q: Can you recall some  of your feelings at
 the time?   Your t
houghts and feelings? 
 

A: I felt like I am a part of the fa mily.  The ci
rcle is now getting closed.  Wh at™s gone, you cannot 
forget it, but now I™m a part of everything.  I™m
 a citizen.  I represent 
the United States and I 
know I will make a good citizen.  I knew it at th
at time, you know it.  I think I ma de a very good 
citizen, you know.  We ™re involved in a lot of th
ings, you know, so we™re doing it.  We™re paying 
back to society, too.  You have to and it™s much
 nicer to pay back than
 receive, much nicer. 
 

Q: A lot of people don™t see 
it that way.  (Laughing.)   

 

A: Yeah, if you need everything, all what you see, 
the things what I need.  But you never see the 
reward, you know, in giving.  That™s 
why I always say the poor has one
 thing that he can afford.  
You know, the reward of giving.  And giving is ver
y, very important.  We  got raised even as a 
child, you know, that you have to collect mo
re to help the other ones.  We call it 
Sc ht uc k a
 
(ph )
, 
you know it.  So to me  it is _____________ you, it is alwa
ys you are there.  If
 I were to take a 
job for an hour, for a dollar an hour, I™m ordered not
 to get it.  You know.  Because I saw there™s 
other people that need it more.  Y
ou know, but it™s nice,
 a good feeling. 
 
Q: Do you still, do you observe–? 

 

A: Highholidays? 

 

Q: –high holidays and do you go at any other time, too? 

 

A: No, any other time , no, but the high holidays, 
I™m going.  And the ma in thing what I™m going to 
is because that they ha ve a prayer for the de
ath, you know it.  And that™s the only one thing, I 
know that I can™t help them, but at least 
I can be with them 
in my mi nd.  You know?  
 

Q: How much of a role in your daily life does that
 me mory play?   Is it th
ere always with you every 
day? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
39
 
 
39
A: Oh, I have to be thankful always, every day to my mother, to my father, give me  life.  They 
taught me  what™s right and wrong.  And they we
re good to me , really good to me , you know.  
Yes, I think of them, in fact, I got their pict
ure hanging where my bed is.  To me , because we 
know everybody has to die, period.  But they got ta
ken away this way, to 
me they are still the 
two young people, you know, my brother, it™s different. 
 Yes, it plays– they still, if you see your 
mother die or father.  They™re old, they™re 
80 years old and we  know everybody can die.  And 
they get wrinkled.  I saw them only as young pe
ople.  You know, so ma ybe it™s a difference. 
 
Q: You me ntioned that it wa s ma ybe ten or 15 year
s ago that you really started talking about your– 
 

A: Because nobody wanted to listen. 

 

Q: What happened ten or 15 y
ears ago that ma de you start? 

 

A: They came out with the Holocaust survival. 
 They showed movies.  People suddenly started 
realizing, you know.  And not only the other people.  Jewish people 
didn™t want to listen, too.  
You know I speak about people.  And 
you cannot speak when nobody listens.   
 

Q: Do you remember any partic
ular events or incidents? 
 

A: I don™t know it, because it™s so ma ny events, but suddenly some thing clicks.   

 

Q: I was wondering, just going back for a mi nute 
to the issue of when you became an American 
citizen, and you talked about how 
important that was to you.  You work a lot with young people, 
young Americans in your work and I was wonderi
ng if you see, if you 
see people as taking, 
young people as taki ng that too lightly– becau
se I think, or  taking it for granted? 
 

A: I speak to schools, a lot of 
the time, I get invited by a school
.  And the young kids.  And I will 
say, we don™t give them enough credit.  Surely th
ey got now the pressure, they got now more 
divorces, where parents go to work and it™s hard
er.  Surely when you have a little bit money, you 
send them in private schools.  But I will say, if you are open when you speak to them, they can 

absorb as good as anybody else.  But you need 
guidance, you know.  We  didn™t have so ma ny 
things when I was, I tell you I w
ouldn™t have done it.  We  didn™t have drugs.  I didn™t even know 
such things exist, you know it.  We  didn™t have 
a lot of things, so how 
in the world can I judge 
and tell them they are bad?   They are not.  
My kids are good.  Their kids are good.  So me times 
you are lucky.  They hang out with the wrong peopl
e– you have to control it, which rooms they 
go.  You for m only one opinion, but 
you have to trust your kids.  A
nd watch out with whom they 
go.  It is very important.  And I will say it agai
n, and if a child ma kes wrong, don™t tell him he™s 
dumb, he™s stupid.  Tell him that he ma de a mi st
ake, but you™re always there, because I know my  
mother would be there, you know.  This wa
y you don™t break off the 
communication.  I wonder 
some ti me s how come  all this homeless people come
 from, you know.  Don™t they have a family?   
Don™t they– everything, you know?   And I 
have no answer for it.  You know.  
 

Q: You me ntioned earlier that your
 children have been interest
ed in Holocaust reme mbrance. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
40
 
 
40
A: Yeah, in fact they belong to
 the second generation.  How?   It™s
 the same  thing, it™s nothing what 
you can change, but we can promote, you know, that people should liste
n what had happened.  
Changing, we cannot, because a lot of people don™
t even believe that such a thing existed. 
 
Q: Did you talk to them about your past, your experiences? 

 

A: Oh yeah, surely, my kids have very open
 mi nded, you can talk to them.  You know, yes. 
 

Q: When they were children did you tell them about their–? 

 

A: Very little children, you can™t, because you break
 their growing up period and you put some thing 
in it, what they will have a hard time.  When
 you have formed your opinion, when you are grown 
up, then it is different.  At leas
t I feel about it this way.  Not th
at I™m right in everything.  I™m 
wrong in a lot of things. 
 

Q: Has that been some thing that they™ve been pa
rticularly interested in
 learning about from you?   
Do they ask you a lot of questions? 
 

A: Oh, I can do nothing wrong.  I am the greatest in 
their eyes.  (Laughing.)  No.  No, if t hey have 
some thing, they ask me , you know.  Or even Jessica, you know, she goes now– I have one 

granddaughter, she goes to Berrington.  She told me
 she woul d like me  to speak for the class in 
Berrington, Illinois, you know.  So, I 
think I got a lot of le
tters and all kinds of things from them, 
what they spoke about. 
 

Q: It must be very gratifying.   

 
A: It is gratifying, you know it.  Especially when 
you don™t expect a lot, th
en it™s double gratifying.  
If I would expect, then it™s some thing different
, you know.  But I don™t and 
it™s double gratifying.  
My youngest, she goes now to Purdue, she got accepted there. 
 
Q: Yourgranddaughter? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: How ma ny grandchildren do you have? 

 

A: Seven.   

 

Q: And what are their name s? 

 

A: Richard, Ben, then comes Jami e and Josh Œ we™ve 
got a lot of J™s, and Jessica and Jacob.  See, a 
lot of J™s.  And there™s my daughter, Janet.  
(Laughing.)  You know, so we
™ve got a lot of J™s. 
 

Q: Richard, Ben, Josh, Jacob, Janet,
 Jessica?   No, not Janet.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
41
 
 
41
A: No, Jessica and then we got Jacob and then we 
got the little baby, she™s ju
st born.  She™s one year 
old, name  is Edie. 
 
Q: Is there anything else you want to add today? 

 

A: It was a pleasure to meet you.  (Laughing.) 

 

Q: It was pleasure to meet you, too. 

 

A: You ask me  all kinds of questions.  What 
can I do, I don™t know it.  You know.  Keep on doing 
the good work.   
 

Q: One thing I didn™t ask you about, I haven™t quite
 figured out how to phras
e the question, but it™s 
so impressive that you came with nothing to th
is country, not even be
ing able to speak the 
language.  And how many, how many
 eye care stores do you own now?  
 

A: Five. 

 

Q: Five.   

 

A: We could have owned more, 
but we have to go slow, you know it.  You know, and I did it more 
for my kids, they are doing it now.  I™m only a, you know, checking– at 75 you can™t do very 

much. 
 

Q: And you live in this very lovely house. 
 So, it™s just very impressive that you– 
 
A: Yeah, you know it is livable.  My wife woul
d like to move out.  But I figure, you know, 75, 
where do I want to go, you know? 
 
Q: How do  you, do you wonder about that or do 
you think about how it 
is that some body can go 
from having so little to just building up so– 
 

A: Oh, some  people got it even bett
er.  No, it is, in life, as I told
 you, you have to take risks.  You 
try to do good and be fair with everybody.  Y
ou got friends, you know it.  And when you have 
this, they will support you.  You cannot go th
rough the world alone, you know it, you need 
friends.  You need fami l y, you know.  And then 
you take a risk and when you lose, you didn™t 

lose everything, you ma de a wrong judgme nt.  So as 
in life with the kids, I told them a lot of 
times, when you ma ke a mi stake, so you ma de a mi
stake.  You know, pick yourself up and keep 

on going, but don™t brood on it. 
 

Q: I didn™t ask you about yourjourney back.  I know that you ma de a journey back to– 

 

A: Poland. 

 

Q: –Poland.  And you talked some  about it 
in your videotape, but I wondered if you– 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
42
 
 
42
A: Yeah, my kids, we decided we™d take the ki
ds, Janet.  And they™re
 always busy now.  And 
Bluma would live in Chicago.  And Ben– 
 
Q: Whose idea was it? 

 

A: Well, I would say my da ughters™ mo re, because they
 want to keep on this relationshi p.  More my 
daughters, Janet and Bluma.  So 
we lived in, I told you, in Germany.  And my wife got a lot of 
relatives still in Germany.  So, we rented a ca
r.  Going to Poland, you don™t get a car, because 
they say they steal it.  So, anyway we used all 
the relatives and we rented a car.  We  flew into 
Frankfurt, from there we went to Czechoslovaki a.  Czechoslovakia, why Czechoslo–, because 

Auschwitz is near the Czech border.  And Czech, it was just liberated, you know, the Russians.  

And if you have money one time and want to have 
a nice trip, go to Prague
.  It™s observed, the 
Germans di dn™t bomb.  All the antiques are st ill there.
  It™s a lot of culture.  So anyway, we went 
to Prague.  We stayed two days in Prague a
nd then we went to Krakow.  Krakow is near 
Auschwitz.  We went to stay the night in Auschw
itz, at Krakow, then we drove into Auschwitz.  
We stayed all day long.  And we had already ma de
 reservations in Wa rsaw.  But we had a car, 
you know, we drove.  In Wa rsaw we ma de reservati
ons at the hotel.  And then from Warsaw, we 

ma de all our journeys from there.  Fi
rst we went to Grodzisk where I told you. 
 

Q: What year was this? 

 

A: In 1992, I think or ‚91 or ‚92.  And the kids,  
we went in the same  house.  You felt the hostility 
from the Poles, but give them a few dollars, it™s okay, you know. 
 

Q: How did you feel it? 

 
A: First, they are afraid that you come  he re and 
you want to take the house away from them and all 
kinds of things.  And then you, let™s see,  a lot of graffiti on the walls.  You  know, I still speak 
perfect Polish.  So, I knew it.  But if you win thei
r confidence, at least th
ey are not so hostile, you 
don™t trust them, but you are ___________.  So, and this 
lady, I told her all I wanted was to show 
my kids where my mothe r  lived, where my fath
er lived, you know, and I give her a few dollars, 
so she spoke already different, you know.  In fact,to be honest with you, before we left the first 

time, you know, we had candle sticks, some  silver. 
 We  didn™t want to take it in Wa r saw ghetto 
and they showed me  whe r e they buried it.  But I 
saw the Poles, I didn™t want them to risk myself 
to go take a look.  They™re probabl
y not, but I didn™t want to.  So, 
anyway, we went to Grodzisk.  
Showed them where we lived.  Showed them 
where my grandfather lived, where I went to 

school.  Oh, I ma de a lot of pictures, too, you know it.
  And then we went back to Wa rsaw.  Next 
day we went to Piotrków, you know it.  And sa
me  thing, I showed them where the ghetto, and 
where we were.  One thing what I couldn™t bring my
self in, to go in this 
room where my parents 
and my grandparents went out the last time.  
I told my kids, I can™t go in, you know, some how I 
couldn™t.  So anyway, so we went there and we 
went back to Wa rsaw.  And then we went to 
Treblinka, this is on the other side from Wa rsaw. 
 And then we stayed there and then we went 
back to Germany.  Went to Buchenwald, where I 
was liberated.  And so we ma de our way home.  
At least I showed the kids, that 
we still lived, we had an apartmen
t. Really it was our house.  You 
know, we were still something.  No doubt that we
 didn™t come out from a rock.  (Laughing.) 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
43
 
 
43
Q: Do you think this was important for your fa mily? 
 

A: And for me  and for them more, 
because I knew it.  They didn™t.  
Yes, it is ver
y, very important. 
 

Q: Do you think they had a new,
 a different understanding of–? 
 

A: Not a new different understanding. 
 They knew, they trusted me , they
 knew that I didn™t lie.  But 
it, seeing with your own eyes is different than imagine.   
 

Q: Was anything from that entire trip particular
ly important for you, personally?   Did you come  to 
terms with something? 
 

A: For me ?   For me  was the worst thing was when I was supposed to go in that room, you know, 
where we lived, in the ghetto, in Piotrków.  C
ouldn™t get in, didn™t go i
n.  This sticks out. 
 

Q: Why that room 
in particular?   
 

A: In Piotrków.  And that is Fitarska 
(ph)
 ten, you know it™s an address.  And across the street, it 
was high holidays in that time.  And the people we
nt over and cried and cried.  I couldn™t go in 
there either, you know.  This is wh
at sticks out in my
 me mory the most.  You go to Treblinka.  
You see all the rocks and all the things.  It™s 
cold.  Here, you know, your mother got killed, but 
you didn™t see it visually,  but the other ones,
 you know, I saw it.  And when I went to 
Auschwitz, you know, and saw the crematorias there.  
I think I didn™t have to 
see, I knew it.  And 
you saw the gate where everybody in 
Arbeit Macht Frei
, you know. 
 

Q: Did you ever, I saw last time that you still ha
ve your tattoo.  Did you ev
er consider having it 
removed?  
 

A: Why would I remove it?   I will ha ve to die w
ith it.  To me, it is now an honor, you know.  I will 
not remove it. 
 

Q: Did people pressure you after the war to rem
ove it or tell you that
 they think you ought to? 
 

A: No, no, nobody pressured me .  In fact, if some
body would pressure me , I would tell them 
different.  No, no.  They can™t see me  for my othe
r side.  I mi ght not tell it in  a harsh way, but I 
can tell them in a nice way.  Put them in place.
  No, it™s my arm anyway in the long run.  
(Laughing.) 
 

Q: That™s right.  And do people comme nt on it, when they see it? 

 

A: Yeah, they saw it now.  You see it on television.  Now it™s different.   

 

Q: Do people stop you to say anything to you after they see it? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 
 
44
 
 
44
A: It™s most was when you speak to the kids, they
™re more sensitive.  You know, you do not tell it in 
a graphic way, because you do not want to hurt them.  But they are more sensitive.  They argue 
and it™s honest.  And otherwis
e you don™t know it.  You mi ght que
stion it or not, that™s fine. 
 

Q: Okay, I™m done.  Do you have a
ny other things you want to say? 

 

A: Listen I told you enough, to repeat again, I appr
eciate it and I like you for it, because you do a lot 
of things, which is good.  Thank you very much. 
 

Q: Thank you very much.
