ou gave people the card
s from people who had

UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: 
 If somebody had Œ like Maria Mahaidan (ph), who 
she became, had gone to Indonesia.  Now, if 
you had forged papers, 
often they were just 
accepted.  But sometimes they would check at
 the main bureau or 
the department.  And 
then if that name wasn 't ther
e, then they knew 
where you were, so you were still arrested 
or they took the people
 in the house where you had been  
living.  So on paper, they would 
bring them back into the central regi
ster and then give the forged -- 

Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker

ody an ID in that name?

rked in all these different departments. 

Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker

Q:  What was that process? 
A:  Huh? 
Q:  How did you do this?  What did 
you have to do to  make this happen? 
A:  Oh, no.  This was just -- 
because I knew so many people in
 all these different offices,

.  And slowly it got more and more involved 

over the years.  I didn't one day st
art saying, "I'm going to do this."

you would be contacted, and so
meone needed an ID
