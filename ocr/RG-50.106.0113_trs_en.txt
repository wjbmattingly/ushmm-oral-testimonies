A: My brother was Œ is Œ his name is 
Stefan Wohl
. 
Q: And is he older or younger than you? 
A: No, he™s 18 months
 younger than I am. 
Q: Did you have any ex tended family liv
ing nearby or with you: aunts, uncles, 
cousins? 

A: No, we did not have Œ we
ll, I should qualify that. Wh
en Œ when we were born, 
we were born in 
Austria
, and my  parents lived half in 
Austria
 and half in 
Poland
. 
They both had family in 
Poland
, but we had no family in 
Austria
. 
Q: So you, as a very young
 child, went back  and fo rth 
between the two countries? 
A: Mostly my  parents went back  and fo rt
h. We, my  brother an
d I being very  young 
and very sheltered, very
 rarely. We stayed in 
Vienna
, and my  parents would come 
and see us, or take us on vacation, or be wi
th  us the part of th
e time that they were 
in 
Vienna
. In other words, we were raised by 
a governess or nurses. Spen t a lot of 
time away from my  parents, although th ey ke
pt coming, but we were at Œ basically, 
until I was five years old, until 
1938, that™s how we lived.  
Q: Do you reme mb er anything about th
e neighborhood that you lived  in in 
Vienna
? 
I know you were very young, obvious
ly, but do you have 
any recollection? 
A: Yes, because I went there and looked at  the street and the house in 1945 - ™46, 

right after the war, and also from my parent
s™ stories. W e lived there in Œ in the

center of town. We lived in th
e Œ what™s known as the third 
bezirke
, which is a 
section of 
Vienna
 right near the 
Belvedere 
Palace, and we had a private three floor 
house, a walk-up kind of thing. I do reme
mber glimpses of it from before the war, 
not too much. 
Q: Was it a primarily Jewish neighbor
hood, or a mixed neighborhood, or Œ 
A: It was not a Jewish neighborhood at 
all, it was probably one of the nicest 
sections of 
Vienna
, not Jewish. 
Q: Not Jewish at all? 

A: No. 

Q: So you really Œ 
A: Not Jewish at all. 
Q: Œ didn™t have Jewish neighbors? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Okay . What kind of wo
rk did your father do? 
A: My father was a banker, and he also was 
an industrialist, he Œ he had a bank in 
Poland
, he had a bran ch  of the bank in  
Switzerland
, he had industry in 
Austria
. He 
had a furn iture factory and a brick factory in Œ in 
Austria
, in 
Vienna
. And because 
he had wide interests in 
Austria
 and my  mo th er preferred 
Austria  
to
 Poland
, that™s

why we Œ he had a residence in 
Austria
, and that™s why my  br
other and I were born 
in 
Austria
. 
Q: Tell me about your schooling th  Œ when
 you were young. 
Wh en did you first 
begin school? 
A: I did not begin school at all, 
because the war broke out September 1
st
, 1939, and 
I was just Œ I had just turned
 in Au gust, seven, and in 
Poland
 school started at  sev Œ 
you know, first grade at seven.
 So I had just been regist
ered. By then we were in 
Poland
, because we went from 
Vienna
 to 
Poland
 after the 
anschluss
. And so I 
never went to school. 

Q: How religious was your family? 
A: Not at all. Not at all, except that they
 were Œ I can only Œ 
I don™t remember too 
many holidays before the war, barely any at
 all. I remember one Passover in 1938, 
in 
Poland
 already, maybe ™39, and Œ but I don™
t reme mb er any Jewish observance. I 
do know that they felt Jewish. During the 
war I remember that I knew we were 
Jewish, and so on, but I don™t remember
 any tradition at home until after the war. 
Q: And going to  synagogue you don™t recall Œ 
A: Never. 
Q: Œ before the war? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

A: Never. I know I never went
. Nev Œ I™d never been to  
synagogue before the war, 
or during the war, for that 
matter. But I Œ the first time
 I was in a synagogue was 
after the war, in 
Brazil
. 
Q: So when you were very young, you 
pla Œ you had non-Jewish playmates? 
A: Not too many playmates, because at 
th at t ime, so meh o w  
children were more 
isolated. There was mo re fear of contag
ion and illnesses and all kinds of things. 
And I had a younger brother and the idea wa
s that that was comp anionship en ough. 
And so I re Œ I only remember very few ot
her children, not at all on a steady basis, 
and my  brother and I ju st played togeth er. 
We also Œ neither one 
of us went to any 
nursery school or anything. Bu t I know
 from what I heard later, that was not 
unusual. Ch ildren Œ some children did grow
 up Œ I think the mo re affluent people 
brought up their children that way. I do know 
th at so me Œ  so me o f  my  co u sin s, my  
husband™s family, his Œ they seem to have 
had a lot of contact with their cousins, 
which I didn™t because I was in 
Vienna
 until I was five, so I Œ until I was five I 
certainly don™t remember any other children. 
Q: So you Œ so things
 went along until 1937, 
and again you were Œ  
A: ™38. 
Q: O-Ok ay. Again, you were quite young.
 What was your first recollection of a 
change in your life? What was the first difference that you recall?

A: I recall that we had went on a trai
n trip somewhere, and then, with our 
governess, or nanny, or 
whatever, and we went to 
Kraków
 from 
Vienna
 without 
our parents, and met them in vien Œ in 
Kraków
 when we arrived. And I remember 
that we were told that we are going to
 live here from now on for Œ for good. And 
that we had Œ and they hired a new govern
ess, who spoke Polish, which we didn™t 

speak, my brother and I, and that we were to ld that it was important for us to learn 

Polish. 
Q: What language had you spoken at home? 
A: German. 

Q: Only ? 
A: German, yes. So, I remember 
that we then started living in 
Poland
. That™s when 
I first also saw some of my relativ es. 
I reme mber my  grandfather coming to our 
house, and going to  my  mate
rnal grandparents, meeting 
some of my  cousins, and 
during th e Œ tha Œ at that point, I rememb er that. 

Q: When did you arrive in 
Kraków
? 
A: I don™t know the exact months, but it mu st a Œ it was right after the 
anschluss
. 
We were still in 
Vienna
 during the 
anschluss
, and my parents were horrified 
because they were in 
Poland
 and th is happened that Œ an-and the two children were 
in 
Vienna
. And then  they were able to smuggle us out, thro ugh 
Switzerland
. They

sent somebody from 
Switzerland
 to pick us up, I know to
 this day who it was. And 
this young man pretended that
 he was married to our gove
rness, and he had a Swiss 
passport. My  brother and I ha
d no papers, or whatever pa
pers we had probably were 
not very good fo r us. And so
 they  took us out, sinc
e we were so young, to 
Switzerland
, pretending that we were their children. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: His name was 
Oswild
(ph) 
Landau
(ph). He was the son, a young son of my  
father™s partner in 
Switzerland
, and he™s still alive, I know, because I hear from 
him and see him occasionally. He™s in Œ quite old now. 

Q: So th e four of you, the tw
o adults and the two children Œ 
A: That™s right, that™s right. But they
 didn™t go all the way with us to 
Kraków
. They 
Œ my  parents then picked us up in 
Switzerland
. 
Q: In 
Switzerland
. 
A: And then  we went to 
Kraków
, and they of course stayed. He lived in 
Switzerland
.  
Q: Do you reme mb er being very  
frightened as a ch
ild doing this? 
A: Not at all. 
Q: Did you Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
10
A: Not Œ no, because I think 
we told we were going to
 go so mewhere and meet my 
parents, or Œ no, I don™t remember it at a
ll. The only th ing I do
 remember from that 
trip was that Œ that I was surprised that
 we were going with them, and that my 
parents didn™t come. I was 
a little surprised, but I can™t
 say that I was surprised 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t rememb er it well. 
Q: Do you have any recollecti
on of being frightened or Œ in 
Austria
 once the 
anschluss 
h a pp en ed ? 
A: No, not at all, no. 
Q: Again, you were very young. 

A: Not at all, no. 
Q: And were you aware of that Œ 
A: No. 

Q: You weren™t, no, okay. 
So th en you went through 
Switzerland
 to 
Kraków
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And where Œ a-a-and where did you se
ttle? Did you settle in town, where did 
you live? 
A: We Œ my father and mother had an apar
tment because there, as
 I said, they spent 
a lot of time in 
Kraków 
as well. They had a large ap
artment right above the bank. 
The bank was on the main floor of this
 building, and our apartment was on th e

11
second floor. And it was a corner build ing, so the apartment went all the way 
around the corner. 

Q: Do you know wh at
 street you were on? 
A: Yes, it was called 
Sarego
, and corner of 
Gertrudy
. It was right near what™s 
known the 
Planty
, which is the moat that surrounds 
Kraków
, which is now a park, 
or at Œ and was at that time,
 as well. It had been a mo
at during medieval times, and 
it then was turned
 into a park. 
Q: And then  what was yo
ur daily life then like? 
A: There, I begin to rememb er that my  mo ther was nervous. 

Q: Did she ever tell you why? 
A: Jittery. No, nobody ever to ld us why. This was the year before the war, life was 
quite normal in Œ in other respects for 
us, but I remember that she was nervous 
because she would take me out sometimes,
 and if I didn™t Œ like I was terribly 
frightened  of thunderstorms, and Œ and ra
ins, and I was once out with my mother, 
she took me and Œ an d a thunderstorm ca
me and sh e was terribly upset with me 

because I cried and screamed. And I rememb er
 feeling that it Œ things were not as 
nice as they used to be, but I can™t rea
lly put my  finger on it in any way, no. 
Q: And so, what was a 
daily routine for you?

A: I don™t quite remember, I think just goi
ng to  Œ to th e park, and having this new 
governess who Œ th e language was a bit of 
a  problem, e v en thou
gh we learned very, 
very quick ly. I remember my  brother saying
 some things in Po
lish that were very 
funny, and everybody laughed at them. An
d they were direct translations from 
German, I™m sure I did that as well. A
nd I remember, as I said, so me of my 
grandparents coming and vis
iting, and us visiting them. I reme mb er that the 
children who had grown up in  
Poland
, my  cousins, behaved very  differently 
towards my grandparents from the way we we
re told to behave. Like they Œ they 
would kiss their hands, my  mo ther didn™t 
let us do that, so we were different. I 
remember being different. Actually, I reme
mber that all my life, being different. 
And so the routine I think was 
just to Œ to go to  the park  and to  eat and to sleep and 
to go out for walks, and nothing in partic
ular. No school or anything like that.  
Q: So you Œ did you have any co
ntact with non-Jewish children? 
A: No, no. Actually, I don™t remember a
ny contact with any ch ildren except my  
cousins occasionally. Even th
at was not encouraged, it was Œ my parents were not Œ 
my parents were not that family conscious,
 I would say. That 
Œ you know, it wasn™t 
the famil Œ because they
 lived from far away and becaus
e they Œ my father was very 
established and very wo rldly.
 And before he married my  
mother he already lived all 
over the world and so  on. Their lifestyle wa
s different from my parents™ relatives in

Kraków
 and therefore, I think they  didn™t always spend a lot of time together. My 
mother was close to her brot
her, who will appear later.  
Q: Okay . And th en when was the 
next change, from going to  the Œ 
A: I should add also that my mother wa
s to her own par Œ actually, my  mo ther was 
close to her own family, but I think she 
lost some contact while she was living 
away, and Œ but she was closer to  her fam
ily than maybe my fa
ther was to his. 
Okay . 
Q: Okay , and th en when was the 
next change in your daily Œ 
A: Oh, the next change I remember very, 
very distinctly was 
when  the war broke 
out. And that was September 1
st
, 1939, and I do rememb er the terrible commo tion 
and screaming and yelling and 
peop Œ and packing, and Œ 
Q: Where were you that day? 
A: I can™t remember the exact day, but I 
was certainly at home, which I described 
before, and my parents were very nervous, 
and everybody was packing. We were all 
at home and Œ and we were Œ 
th Œ we Œ my  father had a large car and my  Œ I guess 
somebody else had a car, but I rememb er 
there was a lot of discussion about who 
was going to  go in which car and how ma
ny th ings we can take and where we 
should go. And in th e end we
 ended up in this car with  my father™s, I guess sister 
and my  co usin who was mu ch older, she was 
14. And her father was the director of 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

the branch in 
Kraków
, so he was the one who was most
 closely associated with my 
father in business. That was his brother-in-
law, and they were with us in the car. 
And Œ 
Q: What were their names? 
A: Their names was Œ her name was li Œ my  cousin ™s name was 
Stefunia
(ph), 
which is 
Stefanie
(ph), and the last name was 
Raab, r-a-a-b
, and her father™s name 
was 
Leon Raab
. And Œ and my aunt, was my fathe
r™s younger sister, her name was 
Eugenia
, and we went in this 
car for a while, and the ne
xt spot where we were 
supposed  to stop was Œ I don™t rememb er 
th e name of the small to wn, it may come 
back to me. But it was the hometown of 
this new powe Œ Po lish Jewish governess 
that they hired when
 we came from Œ from 
Vienna
. And Œ 
Q: What was her name? 

A: 
Amalia
(ph) Œ we called her 
Tetta
(ph), because we calle
d all our governesses 
Tetta
(ph), which was evolve Œ wh ich was baby talk for 
schweste
 in German, and 
then they all became 
Tettas
(ph). So her name was 
Tetta
(ph), just like every other 
one, and her parents came from this little 
town, which must have been a little bit 
east of 
Kraków
, because we were definitely going east. 
Q: You were seven years old. 
What did you take with you? 
A: I don™t rememb er. Whatever th ey le
t me or didn™t let me, I don™t reme mb er. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
15
Q: Okay. Do you reme
mber being frightened? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In the car? 
A: Frightened, uncomfortable. Everybod
y was nervous, it was tight, it was a long 
trip. There was a lot of discussion, among my
 parents particularly, as to where to  
go, and my  father, who was very mu ch of 
an optimist, unfortunately did not size up 
the situation very well, and thought it wo
uld pass in some way, thought that we 
would be comfortable at the Œ at the home
 of this governess, because her parents 
were there, and because there would be 
food there and sh Œ and so on, and my 
mo ther, who was arguing th at this was stupi
d, that as Œ that we shouldn™t stop 
anywhere and we should just go straight to the border with 
Ro ma nia
, that was what 
many people did, and better than we did. Bu t my  father felt that it was not 
necessary, it was a panic, it was Œ also, I 
should actually rec
tify this. We did not 
leave September first, we 
left September third, because my  father insisted on 
staying three days in 
Kraków 
aft Œ wh en th e war began, because people were 
coming to th e bank to  get money out, and he
 felt he couldn™t leave and disappoint 
them. So, we waited two Œ two days or thr
ee days, which was also somewhat fatal. 
So, I rememb er a lot of argument about leav
ing late. Was a lot of tension. That I 
remember, there was a lot of tension. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
16
Q: What Œ do you rememb er what it me ant 
to you as a child that the Germans had 
invaded 
Poland
? Did th at mean anything to you? 
A: No, it didn™t mean anything except this 
panic that Œ that just sort of rained 
around me, I didn™t know why. 
Q: That was the atmosphere of it. 

A: It was more the atmosphere, I didn™t 
have any concep t of wh at the Germans Œ 
Q: What was happening. 
A: Œ were, why everybody was scared, no,
 definitely not. Children were not as 
included in those days as they are now, in 
Poland
. We were very sheltered, and I 
never, for instance, ate with my parents be
fore the war. So, you know, we led very 
much a separate existence. 
So we always ate in our ro
om. So I really don™t know. 
Q: Did you go to your
 governesses house? 
A: Yes, we did. We did, and we must 
have been there Œ a
nd my timing will be 
confused, because I don™t know, we must 
have been there two or three days. And 
then of co urse, the war progressed, and I 
remember there was the first bombing was 
there, there were Œ you know, there were si
ren, there were planes, we went to some 
cellar. There was a commotion, it was crowde
d in her house. And I don™t know how 
long we were there, probably a few days, 
and then we started moving east again.

And again in the same car, a
nd all in all, we were, I th
ink, 14 people, between that 
car and my  uncles car, I think. Th
at means on my father™s side.  
Q: So you Œ you said yo
u had gone into th e she
lter during th e bomb ing. 
A: Yeah, there was a bombing, and I rememb
er a lot of commo tion and going into Œ 
Q: Was that a terribly fright
ening experience for you? 
A: Yes, because it was noisy . It was very, 
very, you know, that the siren was noisy, 
the bombs were noisy, the planes comi
ng low, and it was Œ yes, that was Œ 
Q: You saw Œ you actually saw planes? 

A: You did see planes, yes, yes. And th at
 was frighten Œ frightening. I must say, I 
was very frightened  of bombing th roughout the war. Some people were mo re Œ 
some children were more, some w ere le
ss, I was always very frightened of 
bombing. To me it was worse than lightning;
 I was frightening of lightning and this 
was like, you know, amplified lightening. 
So, I was always afraid of that.  
Q: And then  you continued on? 

A: Then we continued on in  two cars, and Œ 
Q: This is still the two families? 

A: Yes, but now I may Œ 
getting confused. I remember o u r car, but then my 
mo ther™s brother somehow was there too, an
d he was in another car with his family, 
and I guess my mother™s sister an d her tw
o sons, and there was a lot of family at

that point, and we were in two cars, and 
we headed east. And 
then I remember the 
next stop was some sort of an abandoned 
house, where the people had fled. It was 
not a Jewish house, it was lik
e an estate. And it was abandoned and we Œ it was big, 
and we were very happy to fi
nd shelter there, and we stay
ed there a couple of days. 
And by that time it was difficult to get gasolin
e, and so my uncle went out to try to 
get gasoline, they got gasoline. And then
 there was a commotion; my father was 
ready to stay as usual, and then  my  father 
Œ but then he was conv
inced that he Œ that 
we shouldn™t stay, and in the meantime we 
had news Œ we already saw, I remember, 
Polish sold iers who were either deserting,or their units had b
een broken up, they 
were running. And we kne
w that the front was not 
doing very well, and th e 
Germans were advancing, so th en we we
nt, ag ain, east. And I don™t know how 
many days this whole trip took, but it took a few days. Wh en it Œ 

Q: How about fo od, did you have enough fo od? 

A: We Œ on the way, we bo
ught Œ I guess we had some m
oney, we bought fo od, and 
in this house that was abandoned, we fo
und food. I remember that was one reason 
why we stayed there for a few days, that th
ere was plenty of food there. And then 
we went on and the next memory 
I have was of a little to wn called 
Zwa t r u f
(ph), 
which was already in eastern 
Poland
. And there we Œ there we got into some 
apartment that belonged to some Jewish pe
ople. It might have been somebody my

father knew, I don™t Œ I don™t know who 
they were. But there I remember a big 
discussion between Œ a big mo re than disc
ussion, a fight between my  uncle and my  
father, because it was Œ by that time it was Œ 
I remember that it was the first Jew ish 
holiday, it was Rosh Ha
shanah, and my father decided 
to stay over the holiday and 
then continue to the Romani
an border, because that was 
sort of the ultimate goal, 
that everybody thought we Œ 
one should go to . And my  unc
le felt that we should go 
immediately, and this is nonsense to st
art sitting and waiting. And Œ but then  my  
father wasn™t well, he didn™t feel well, a
nd we stayed. And we stayed there, I think, 
over the holidays, and maybe a couple of 
days longer. I don™t rememb er how long 
we were there, but it was a few days. And th
en, because he didn™t feel well, w e did 
not go to the Romanian bord
er til much, much later.  
Q: What happened in  between? 
A: In between I just remember th at we 
were living in  Œ in  very  uncomfortable 
conditions and ev erybody was discussing when
 and where we should go, that™s all I 
remember. But it was like a layover, we were 
just there waiting to 
Œ to decide what 
next. That™s all I remember.  

Q: And then  you Œ yo
ur Œ you continued Œ 
A: And then eventually, yes,
 my father was feeling better. I later found out that it 

was a gallbladder attack. He had gallbladde
r problems, I didn™t
 know what they

were at the time. So that delayed us. Ag
ain it was the Je wish 
holidays originally, 
that we were supposed to wait 
just for two days and then  he 
didn™t feel well, so it Œ I 
don™t know how long we were there. But an
yway , then we went 
to a place called 
Kolo myia
 which was on the border, not far fro
m the border. And there I think we 
stayed with Œ I don™t know, in somebody™s house, wasn™t too 
uncomfortable. And 
we had Œ by then th e borders had been 
closed, they were already guarded. The 
confusion was somewhat over. The Ru ssians had occu pied eastern
 Pola nd
, the 
Germans had occupied  western 
Poland
. This was already after the three weeks that 
Poland
 defended itself. And at that point I rememb er we were in 
Ko lomy ia
 and we 
were waiting there to go to 
Romania
. And by that time there were some guides, and 
people wh o would help, for m
oney, would help you cross 
and so on, but you had to 
wait, because they couldn™t take too many pe
ople at the same time. And at that time, 
I even remember that they 
did put me in a school, beca
use I Œ I remember sitting 
there and making whole rows of 
A
s and 
B
s on lined paper. And we were there for 
three months. 
Q: This was your first school? 

A: This was my first scho
ol. And I reme mb er writing 
A
s and 
B
s and straight lines. I 
remember that. 

Q: And what kind of school was it? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
21
A: I don™t rememb er so mu ch the school its
elf as having to write these long lines of 
the same letter. It was a public
 school in this little town 
Kolo myia
. And since we 
were there, and they  just sent us to sc
hool. Not us, my  brother 
didn™t go, he was too 
young, I did. So I went to first grade. 
Q: Were they non Œ non Jewish schools? 

A: Non-Jewish children, yes. Po Œ it was a Polish school. 

Q: Polish school. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And by then your Po
lish was good enough? 
A: By th en I could sp eak, yes, because we 
were there already a year, and with this Œ 
this last 
Tetta
(ph) hardly spoke any German, that
 was why th ey hired her, and so 
yes, yes; children learn very quickly. 

Q: What were your classmates actions to
wards you? Was there any problem that 
you Œ 
A: No, no, I don™t reme
mb er any at all, no. 
Q: And no incidents on the st
reet, talking on the street? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, we just
 lived there. No, I don™t Œ 
Q: Was it a Jewish village, or Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
22
A: 
Kolo myia 
apparently,
 
this I learned later, was a very Jewish town, full of Jews. 
So maybe our neighbors and everybody wa
s Jewish. I really don™t know. I don™t 
know, I Œ I wasn™t aware of it one way or the other. 
Q: So you remember these thr
ee months as relatively calm? 
A: Calm. Absolutely, relatively calm, yes.
 And then one ma Œ one day my  mo ther 
told us that my  brother and my  father we
re going to cross the border beca Œ an-and 
go, and leav e and then she and I would fo
llow a few days later. You couldn™t cross 
in large groups. It was done by 
[indecipherable]
 and my  Œ my  father was supposed 
to go with his brother-in-law, and he did, 
as a matter of fact, and my brother. Fo  Œ 
why the men went ahead, wha-wha-what 
this decision was made on, I don™t know, 
but the idea was that they w
ould go ahead and then my  mo
ther and I would follow. I 
do know that my  aunt and my  co usin, who 
was with us originally in the car, had 
gone directly to the border 
when my father was delaye
d by his illness, and they 
were already in 
Romania
. And that™s why maybe her husband, who was my  
father™s brother-in-law, was supposed to go
 first with him, and I guess they decided 
to take my  brother, so that
 my mother wouldn™t have 
to go with two children. I 
don™t know what the reasoning was, but that™s how it was.  

Q: So this is what, December 1939? 
A: This mu st be by no
w about Decemb er 1939. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

Q: And so th ey Œ the first group of men left? 
A: Maybe Novemb er. Because I don™t remember snow yet. I think it might have 

been November still.  
Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah, the first group left. 

Q: And you were left
 with your mother. 

A: Right. 
Q: Was that upsetting to you, that 
your brother and your father left? 
A: No, I don™t particularly remember it as 
being upsetting, because there wasn™t that 
much time to be upset or no
t upset, because very soon, 
maybe on th e next day, we 
learned that they had been captured on th
e border. So, we never followed. So I Œ 
that was upsetting, because I remember 
my mother crying and that was very 
upsetting, yes. And also the Œ the Œ the idea
 that my five year old brother was now 
in jail with my father and Œ and she didn™
t know where and how 
and so on. We her 
Œ we learned from the guy that that™s what had happened, or 
[indecipherable]
 I 
don™t Œ I wasn™t there when  she learned a
bout it, but Œ or at least I don™t rememb er, 
but I remember her crying, and it was quite awful. 

Q: A-And th en? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
24
A: And then what happened was that she tried to contac
t the Russian authorities to 
see if she could see my father, or at leas
t her goal was to pick up my little brother 
from jail. S o  she tried, how she tried I do
n™t know, she mu st have gone there and 
pleaded with them. I wasn™t 
with her, she left me at home Œ at home, I don™t know, 
with the landlady or something,
 I don™t remember that part. 
[break]
 And then  she 
was able to Œ they told her that Œ that 
they would release my  brother, and she should 
come and pick him up. 
Q: How far away was your father 
and your brother from your town? 
A: Very close, because this
 town was on the border. So it
™s very possible that he 
was in jail right in that to
wn, that they brought him fro
m Œ the few kilometers from 
the border back there, I don™t know, I ne
ver saw him. But my  mo ther went and 
brought my brother bra Œ back. So then she 
had both of us, but my father was in jail 
and she had no contact with him. And then  
she decided to go Œ 
to go and join her 
own family, and they  were in 
Zw a t r u f
(ph), and by her own family I mean her 
parents and her older sister and my uncl
e, me aning her brother, and his wife and 
three children. And her sister™s tw o child
ren. Even tually we ended up being 14 
people. And they had an apartment or some
 way of living in Œ in this town called 
Zwa t r u f
(ph), and we joined them there. 
Q: How did you get there? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
25
A: And Œ don™t remember. I imagine we either
 took a train Œ probably  a train, but I 
do not remember. All I remember 
is that they were all very, 
very nice to us, and that 
we lived there with them, and it was crow
ded, but it was peaceful and nice, for a 
short time. And my  uncle would go to 
Lwów
, which was not too far away, a few 
hours away, I presume. And he would come
 occasionally, and he wa Œ got a job in 
Lwów
 and he was making money. In other wo
rds, he was earning, he was the only 
one who was earning and he ha
d a job, and he had friends and co nnections, but he 
left his family, his parents and so on in
 this place, and we were with them. 
Q: Did your brother tell you 
anything Œ and a gra Œ I Œ I 
do know he was five years 
old Œ did he tell you anythi
ng about his prison experi
ence with your father? 
A: No, no, I don™t rememb er anything. 

Q: So your brother 
did not remember that experience that Œ 
A: He either didn™t, or he may have talked
 about it like a five year old would, and I 
don™t rememb er what he said
, or I don™t Œ I don™t know. 
Q: So th ere you were this big group. 

A: There we were, this big group, and then
 Œ and we did not go 
to  school any mo re 
on th e Œ I, or an Œ my  cousins. And th
en one night there was a big commo tion, 
yelling and screaming and bang
ing and that™s when the Ru
ssians came with Œ with Œ 
what do they call it, the tr
ucks, and they load ed us on trucks and to ok us to the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
26
trains, and deported us. I do remember 
Œ I™ll go back a little bit Œ during the time 
when we were there with our big family
 group, there was a lot of discussion 
whether to take Russian citi
zenship or not. The Russians o
ffered passports to all the 
people wh o had fled from western 
Poland
 into eastern
 Poland
, they could become 
Russian citizens. There was a lot of discu
ssion because one didn™t know whether to 
do th at or not to, because if you did that, it 
seemed to us Œ at least th at™s what the 
grownups were saying, then we would neve
r, ever have a chance of leaving what 
was occupied Russian territory, or 
Russia
 itself, because we were Russian citizens. 
So that was sort of giving up. On th e ot
her hand, the risk of remaining with th e 
Polish passports, wh ich we had,
 was that then we would 
be treated badly, possibly 
deported. There were talk
s about deportations to 
Siberia
, and that was a different 
risk, but I know that we did not take the 
Ru ssian passports because we thought that 
was like abdicating altogeth er. So we
 were deported, all 14 of us.  
Q: What was it like? 
A: That I remember. T h at I already Œ ther
e I have vivid memo ri
es. It was Œ it was 
cargo cars or cattle cars, and we were 70 pe
ople in one of them, in each one of 
them. And Œ and the conditions were very, ve
ry bad. There was one in the center of 
this big cattle car, there was one pipe wh
ich was the toilet, and it wasn™t even 
covered or Œ or Œ or 
separated. So I remember that so
me people gave some blankets 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
27
or spreads or sheets, I don™t remember, 
and those were somehow hung up there and 
my mother was rather witty, kept saying sh
e could tell exactly from the feet as to 
who was in there, and that was a big Œ with
 the children, for us it was a sort of a 
game about guessing who was in there. But 
I remember that very
 distinctly. And the 
train would stop quite often and then the Ru
ssians would come in and th ey didn™t 
mistreat us or anything, they didn™t even
 come in. They  would open the door and 
from the platform they would hand us th
e food. They brought 
big pots with Œ and 
mo stly it was soup, I rememb er, some sort 
of soup. It was not great, but they  did 
bring it twice a day over there. And also, we 
used to stop a great deal and it took us 
Œ we went all the way to Œ very  far, we
 were deported all the way to Œ yeah, 
Kutskaya Oblast
, which was near 
Yakutsk
 which is almo st as far as you can go 
without going to 
Ma nchuria
, I guess. And it took us six 
weeks to get there. So we 
tra Œ but six weeks with a great number of stops, because they did stop all the time, 

they stopped at different stations, I imagin
e w h en  th ey  n e ed ed  th
e tracks they would 
put us on a side track, but I know we stopped a lot. 

Q: Okay, let™s talk a little 
bit more about that journey.
 Were there men, women and 
children together in a car? 
A: Yes, yes. All the families were t
ogether. And one additional thing that I 
remember from that trip was 
that my  brother got scarlet fever durin g that trip. And 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
28
he was very  sick, then my  cousin got it. An
d they tried to isolat
e them in one corner 
of this car, and my  mother was going Œ ab
solutely falling apart, because Œ I mean, 
she was brave, but she was carrying on quite  a bit because he was so sick. And there 
was even a docto r in another car who came, 
and my mother used to tell much later 
that he said it would take a miracle for 
my  brother to surv ive, because he was 
supposed  to be on a salt free diet, or wh at
ever one does with scarlet fever. And he 
was quite sick. He was very sick. And so
 we were families together, yes; men, 
women an d children. 
Q: And what Œ was there any place to sit down, were there seat Œ 

A: On the floor, there were Œ and suitcases. 
Q: And suitcases. 
A: On the suitcases, yes. And then things 
were spread on the floor to Œ to make 
sleeping Œ to  make sleeping possible. 

Q: So were you able to stretch out? 
A: Yes, we were able to sort of, like sard
ines, one next to the 
other, we Œ we had Œ I 
remember sleeping, yes. 
Q: And how much light was in the car? 
A: There was some light from the windows,
 which were high up. There must have 
been light because I remember 
th at my mother, to keep us
 busy, this is one of the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
29
great things she did, the girls, she taught
 me how to darn sock
s on that trip. And 
when we ran out of socks w
ith holes, I remember she made
 holes in socks and then 
I darned them over and over again. And I became very proficient at it, so I Œ there 
must have been light, to do that. 
Q: Did you have any special doll or 
toy with you? Was there something Œ 
A: No, I don™t rememb er that Œ anything like that. 

Q: You don™t rememb er bringing
 anything that was special. 
A: The only amusing in cident I rememb er 
fro m that trip, I mean, there were many, 
that as strange as it seems in all thes
e horrible situations there was always 

something humorous. And I reme mb er that wh
en  we stopped in all the different Œ in 
all the different, I presume small towns 
or wherever we stopped, there was 
inevitably an enormous statue of 
Stalin
 and 
Lenin
 on the platform
, and they were 
usually life-size. And one da
y we stopped at dusk, and us
ually wh en we stopped, 
somebody, very often my  mo th
er, would climb up on two or
 three suitcases to reach 
the little window, that™s how I 
remember th ey were high up
, and try to get Œ ask the 
passersby to give us some food or anything.
 Water, food, whatever we were wa Œ sh 

Œ literally begging. And one 
day she was sa Œ she turn
ed around and said to 
everybody, well today we are sure to get 
wh at I asked for. Says, do you know who I 
just spoke to? I spoke to 
Stalin
 in person. It was Œ sh
e was talking to this 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
30
[indecipherable]
 and suddenly she rea
lized that it was one of the statues. So 
anyway, often these peasants did hand so
mething over, and sh e learned a few word s 
of Russian, 
laybeonki
(ph) being children, and you know, I rememb er her always 
saying about the children. I always felt that like, that we were the Œ the cause of all 
evil, because th Œ we were used for Œ for 
that kind of begging.
 Like we were the 
only reason why she Œ she did it. 

Q: What was the atmo sphere inside the ca
r? Were people helping each other, were 
they supportive of each other?  

A: I remember arguments about space. I do remember a rguments about, you know, 

th Œ particularly when  my  brother got si
ck and they Œ my  Œ my  mo th er and Œ and 
then later, a few days later, my cousin 
got sick, and there were arguments even 
about Œ between my mo
ther an-an-and the mother of 
th is cousin, and Œ who was her 
sister-in-law, about Œ because I guess ev
erybody was so anxious. And I remember 
w h en  th ey  w a n t ed  to  iso l at
e the sick children, they 
had to Œ needed  space from 
another family, so they displaced them a lit
tle, and tried to tell them the space here 
was just as good, whatever was left wh
en th ey moved the other children. There 
were arguments about space, definitely. Th
at I rememb er. On Œ in other ways, I 
think there was also support. It wasn™t 
a constant argument, but th ere was tension 
about space, physical space.

Q: You said that the train made a lot of 
stops. Were you able to
 get out of the car 
and move around? 
A: No, no, no. 
Q: You were inside the car for Œ 
A: We were inside Œ 

Q: Œ six weeks. 

A: Œ six weeks, yes. We were not able 
to get out on th e platforms, we were not 
allowed. 

Q: And Œ 

A: The doors never opened unless they brou
ght us food. So that™s why my  mo th er 
always Œ 

Q: How often wou Œ did 
they bring the food? 

A: I think sh e Œ I don™t remember it, but I 
think two or three times a day. They  did 

give us food twice a day for sure. 
Q: What kind of food 
did they  give you? 
A: Soup mostly. Soup mostly
, black bread and hot water. 
Kipyatok
 they called it. 
Q: And did you just wear the same clothes the whole time? 

A: I think so . I think so. I don™t rememb
er changing or washing. There was some 
washing, but I don™t remember h o w. I don™t remember. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

32
Q: Did you play with th e other ch ildren, wo rd games or Œ 
A: Yes, a lot. And my mother told us st
ories and we darned the so cks and we did 
word  games and finger games, 
and yes, a lot, and Œ and Œ 
Q: What was the weather like during your journey? 

A: It was Œ I don™t remember it as bein
g cold or anything, because we were 
deported, I think in June. I do remember that
 I turned eight in 
Œ when  Œ after, right 
after we arrived in 
Siberia
. So we mu st have arrived around August. And there it 
was very, very hot, because th ey have a short, hot summer. 

Q: During th e journey, was there a
ny talk of people trying to  escape? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er any Œ 
Q: That you were aware of. 
A: No, I wa Œ I Œ no, I don™t think at that 
point Œ there was a lot of talk people trying 
to escape, and I do remember that late
r on when we were already settled in 
Siberia
, 
but not from the train, I don™t rememb er that, no. 
Q: Was there any difference in the actions 
between the men Œ of the men, or of the 
women Œ any di Œ any differenc
e in behavior of the men or the wo men on Œ in  the 
car? 

A: Not that I am aware of, no, no, I do
n™t remember. I remember differences in 
people close to me. I remember my moth
er se Œ actions and attitudes were very 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
33
different from my aunt™s actions and attit
ude. Some people despaired. There was a 
lot of despair and crying and so on. My
 mo ther did not succumb to that, and I 
remember thinking that she was different, 
because she really did not do that. She Œ 
she was much more resource ful, and much more Œ well,
 she used her charm, her 
intelligence, she was very clev
er, and so on, to Œ to ac
hieve something, to gain 
things for herself and for us, but mainly fo
r us, so Œ mainly for my brother was sick. 
But Œ and th e others sort of just despaire
d. Also, there was a lot of talk like we™ll 
never get out of here, and this
 is the end, and my mother 
arguing that this is not so, 
that it™s not the end because we really do
n™t know what Œ that
 the Œ you know, she 
didn™t give in to that. 
Q: And your me mo ries of your 
feelings then, during th at trip? 
A: I don™t have any memo ries of my  fe
elings, except ma ybe some fear of the 
uncertain, but nothing other 
than  that, no. No, I don™t even rememb er being Œ I 
reme mb er being very  crowded, but I don™
t rememb er being very  uncomfortable. I 
don™t rememb er, you know, any physic
al pain or anything like th at, no. 
Q: Do you reme mb er being hungry? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you rememb Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
34
A: I think that the food ca me fairly regularly, and my 
mo ther probably gave us 
enough, because I remember th
at people did say that they
 were hungry. But I think 
she again made sure that Œ that
 I had enough. I was not hungry. 
Q: And you weren™t cold, because the weather Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ you said, was more mild Œ 

A: We were not cold , no, no Œ 
Q: Œ at that point. 
A: Œ no, and we were crowde
d, so it wasn™t cold, no. 
Q: Now your father wa-was not w
ith you, he was still in prison? 
A: Yes, and we had absolutely, after my 
mo ther picked  up my  brother, she had no 
mo re contact, no Œ nor did we
 have any knowledge wh ethe
r he Œ what happened to 
h im. And  th at was so meth in g  I do  rememb e
r, because she talked 
about that a lot, 
that we didn™t know whether he was dead or
 alive, or that he was in jail, where he 
was, nothing. Absolutely
 nothing. And she talk
ed a lot about that. 
Q: Did you and your brot
her miss him very mu ch? 
A: I don™t know whether we missed him. I gu
ess, yes, I think that th-the uncertainty, 
th-the insecurity that he was gone, and 
her despair over that. That was the only time 
she showed despair was when
 she talked about not knowi
ng what happened to  him. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
35
So that, I think affected us mo
re than the Œ just that he 
wasn™t there. Again, I must 
emphasize that we didn™t see 
that mu ch of our parents 
when we were very young, 
cause he was not, you know, a father like to
day. He was a father was in the office, 
who came in maybe a few minutes before we 
went to sleep. So I really didn™t Œ he 
was not directly involved in
 our care, daily lives, so 
I don™t, you know, it wasn™t 
[inaudible] 
Q: Did Œ you said the j
ourney took six weeks. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did it seem like mo re than six weeks? 

A: Yes, it seemed endless. Yes, it seemed 
lik e a very long time, endless, yeah, that 
it seemed. And also, you must remember th at 
we had ab solu tely no
 idea as to where 
we are being taken. So we didn™t know wh ether it would take one week, six weeks, 

four week s, and also wh ere our final des
tination was we had no id ea, so it was just 

going and going and going. Nobody
 knew where we were going. 
Q: But the guards treated you all right Œ 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Œ well, no problem with that. 
A: No, no, no, no problem. They
 brought the food and left. 
Q: And then finally you arrived.

A: Finally we arrived, and 
it was very hot there, I reme
mber that, and there was a 
lot of like wheat, or very tall grass where we
 arrived. It was like fields and forests. 
We were actually in the middle of the 
Taiga
, which are these enormous forests in 
Russia
, and Œ in 
Siberia
. And there were barracks, we
 did not have to build  our 
own. There was like a settlement there waiting for us. 
Q: Wha Œ you arrive, th -the 
car stopped, a
nd you got out. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Do  yo u  reme mb er t h at mo men t ? 
A: I do remember that Œ that
 it was wonderful to get out. 
Q: I was going to say, wh
at were your feelings Œ 
A: Yes, it was wonderful, and I remember b e
ing very impressed with this tall grass, 
which was very tall, it was almo
st as tall as I was. And th
en we walked through this 
grass, and then there were these houses, 
which I rememb er seeing, they were like 
huts, and there were like 10 or 12 or 15
 maybe of them, I don™t know how many. 
And there was a central one where we all ha
d to go and line up, and they assigned 
these houses. And I remember th at my mo
ther was very anxious for this whole 
family, we were 14 people, 
our family, to get our own 
house. And mo st of these 
houses housed between 16 or 20 people. 
And her big accomp lishment was that we 
did get one of these 
houses just for us.

Q: How was your health at that point? 
A: Mine was fine. 

Q: How was your brother? 
A: My brother was better by then, but very
, very weak, and very
 emaciated. And Œ
but he was better, he was no longer critical, 
and his fever, I think, had gone by then. 
And my  health was fine. 
Q: Were there many other children from other families Œ  
A: Yes, there were Œ 
Q: Œ in this group of people? 

A: Yes, there were many children. There 
were many children, and after we all got 
settled, and this I remember also very distinctly, after they allocated these different 
huts to different Œ to Œ to all these people
, and everybody was more or less se tt led, 
they Œ you had to register again for work. 
The adults had to register for work, and 
the children had to register for school. A
nd th ere were many children, but they  were 
Œ it seemed that they didn™t have enough ch
ildren who belonged in
to second grade, 
which was where I should have gone. And 
I knew by then how to
 read and write a 
little, becau se I had learned Œ th
ree months I was in the Œ 
in that school, and maybe 
I learned on my  Œ by my self, or whatev
er, but Œ but I didn™t know Russian, of 
course. Now this school was going to be 
in Russian, and I reme
mber that I Œ they 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

38
had a first grade and a third grad e, or en
ough children to Œ for those age groups, and 
they were in the Œ so mehow in the same 
room, there was the Œ why they had th em 
in the same room, I guess they didn™t have
 enough teachers, or they didn™t have 
enough ch ildren, and I reme mb er
 that they were Œ and I wa
s in first grade. And with 
a Œ that was one of the things that they di
d very quickly. I reme mb er we barely got 
there and we Œ and th ey  made us go to  sc
hool, and they made the adults wo rk. And 

we all got like an 
I.D. 
card. The ch ildren got them 
and the working adults. And 
unless you had that, you coul
d not buy food. By then  you were buying fo od, they 
had like a dispensary. But 
you had to show your 
I.D.
 work card or school card to 
get your rations. You couldn™t just 
come with rubles and buy it.  
Q: Where did you get the Œ wh ere did the adults get the money from? 

A: From wo rking. They  
were compensated, yes. 
Q: They got paid. Oh, they
 got paid for working. 
A: They got paid, yes. 
Q: What were the sleeping arrangements like? 
A: That I remember very well, too,
 because they were Œ it was called a 
pritcha
(ph). 
It was a Œ like a bunk made out of wood,
 and it was right above the floor, and it was 
long. It was on the floor, and it was made 
out of boards. And so we, all 14 of us, 
slept on this one long th ing, and it was ve
ry tight. And so, when I remember th at 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
39
when one person turned, ever
ybody turn ed. And to  this day I can™t stand sleeping 
with anybody, because it just Œ I can™t sl
eep when somebody ke
eps turning, because 
I turn too. So that was terrible. The sl
eeping arrangements were very, very tight. 
Very tight. 

Q: But you had fo od. 

A: We had some food. We had some food 
and Œ but not adequate
 food, there were 
shortages of Œ there were 
no Œ no vegetables. People st
arted getting scurvy, people 
started getting all kinds of Œ because they we
re deficient in Œ in so  many foods. But 
we didn™t have Œ and we were not starvi
ng, but we didn™t have adequate food. But 
very soon after we arrived there, we starte
d getting fo od parcels, because Œ I have to 
backtrack. My uncle was not deported. He 
was the only one of my mother™s family, 
because he was working in 
Lwów
, as I had said before, 
and he was not home that 
night. So he was not deporte
d. And he, wh en he heard 
that his whole fami ly was 
deported, his three children, his parents, hi
s si sters, and his wife, he wanted to run 
after the train. He thought he would go an
d run after the train. And his friends in 
Lwów
 told him this was stupid Œ a stupid 
thing to do because you would get on 
some train Œ if you go there, 
to the station, they™ll deport
 you, but by no means will 
you be on the same train. You may never find them. If you stay in 
Lwów
, you may 
be able to help them, but this way it Œ it 
Œ it would be ludicrous
. So he stayed. And 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

40
he had a very good job with the Ru ssian
s, and so he made money and he sent 
parcels to us. How he knew where we were
, I don™t know, but he did Œ we got the 
parcels. We were 
[phone ringing- break
] So we got the parcels Œ as a matter of 
fact, I don™t Œ it Œ it still is a puzzle to me
 how he knew where he was, or whether 
he just sent them by name to 
Siberia
 and by mira-miracle we got them, but we did 
get them. And I remember that he sent s
ugar and fat and tea and coffee and things 
like that. I remember p articularly the sugar and the fat.  
Q: What kind of fat? 
A: And that™s an interesting story too. The 
fat was some kind of lard or chicken fat. 
And the problem with that was that my 
grandmother was still very religious. And 
my  uncle, who was not religious any mo re, 
and who was a very clever and shrewd 
kind of person, and a very 
good son and Œ and father, an
d very  fami ly-minded, he 
wanted th e worst way, because he knew wh
at the conditions there were, that we 
should all eat this, particul
arly his mo ther. And so he 
himself certified it. And so 
what it was, it was he Œ after the war he told 
me that it was just 
at first he c-couldn™t 
get any kosher fat, and then he just certif
ied it himself. So it was different kinds of 
lards, whatever he could get. Goose fat,
 chicken fat, ma ybe lard. I don™t know, 
whatever. And it came, and Œ 

Q: Did Œ did this camp that you 
were in have a specific name? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
41
A: No, it did not have a specific name, it was a Œ I wouldn™t even  call it a camp, it 
was a Œ it was a work settlement, it was a Œ 
it was a settlement. 
They had deportees 
in 
Siberia
 fra Œ during the Œ the Œ th e purges th
at they did during Tsar™s time. There 
were deportees there in the nearest town, wh
o had been  deported 11 years befo re, as 
I reme mb er the number exactly because it always se Œ stuck in my  mind. And these 

people had been there for Œ political depor
tees, who had no way 
of ever getting out, 
at least they thought, and 
they  kept telling us that we would also remain Œ these 
were work settlements Œ that we would also
 remain there foreve
r, because whenever 
we said well, you know, maybe someday 
we™ll get out, or after the war, or 
something, they used 
to tell us there™s no hope. So there were Œ there were different 
Œ this area had been populate
d by different deportees over the years, just like when I 
was 
Yakutsk
 in nine Œ four years, five years a
go. They  had a lot of deportees from 
the Tsar™s time, who now are several generati
ons later, and they just stayed there. It 
could have happened  to  us, thank God it didn™t. 
Q: What did you learn at school? 
A: Oh, I learned how to read and write in
 Russian. And also th
ey had a very Œ I 
reme mb er that they had a very stro
ng program of indoctrination of Œ 
Stalin 
was our 
hero, he was our father, he Œ around Christ
ma stime they asked us to pray to God for 
candy, and we did, an d nothing happened of 
course. And then they  asked us to ask 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

42
Stalin
, whose portrait was right in front of 
course, and we got candy. It was the 
only time we got candy, it was that kind of
 atmo sphere. And it was always glory, 
the glory of 
Russia
 and the glory of 
Stalin
, the glory of communism. That was all 
the reading material and all of that Œ that 
was what we learned in school, but mainly 
to read and write.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: I don™t rememb er the school as be
ing unpleasant. I do rememb er Œ I Œ I 
reme mb er being Œ it was difficult, because 
we had to  walk one kilometer. Took us 
about 10 or 15 minutes, and wh en it got cold
 Œ because once the 
snow falls there, it 
never melts, it Œ and they Œ we Œ they dug lik
e a little trail, and on either side there 

were banks of the snow, which was tall 
as I was. And we all got what™s called 
valenkis
, the children got, they  were boots ma
de out of a heavy felt. And they  
allocated those for children 
to go to school in, and I rememb er walking th at 
distance.  

Q: But the subjects that yo
u were learning in school? 
A: I learned how to  read and write, and 
I don™t think it was divided by subjects, I 
think it was just mainly the glory of 
Russia 
and reading and writi
ng, that™s all I 
remember of that. 

Q: What did you do for pleas
ure, the children? Anything? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
April 22, 1994 
 

 
 
43
A: I imagine we played in the snow 
and it was not terrib Œ I don™t rememb er 
anything for pleasure. Stories, being 
home, games, running around. Noth ing in 
particular. I mean, nothing organized, or Œ 
Q: Besides the boots they gave you Œ 
A: There were also jackets. 

Q: Œ did you have enough clothes? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Oh, th ey gave you clothes. 
A: They allocated Œ for childre
n, they gave us those lined
 or interlined jackets and 
Œ 
Fufa ikas
, they were called, and work
ing people also got those. 
Q: What kind of wo rk 
did your mo ther do? 
A: They Œ in th
e forest, in the 
Taiga
, women Œ men cut branches and trees Œ it was 
cleaning the 
Taiga
. It was cleaning the forest. Men 
cut the branches and the dead 
branch es, and women gathered them and carri
ed them to Œ to central sort of spots 
where they  were burned. So  it was to clea
n out the undergrowth. It was heavy work , 
it was hard work , because you had to carry
 th e branch es, and then Œ it was hard, 
physical work. My mother, st
rangely enough, was very, very pamp ered and spoiled, 
said she, physically she felt very well the Œ 
End of Tape One 

44 
Interview with Riane Gruss 
January 5, 1996 

 

 
 
Beginning Tape Two 
Q: This is tape two, side one, and 
we were talking about your arrival in 
Siberia
 in 
August 1940, wh en you were eight year
s old. You were with your mother and 
brother. And you™ve already described some
 of the conditions there, but I was 
wondering, what was your first impression when  you arrived? 
A: We got off the train and sort of a 
Œ in the middle of nowh ere, and then I 
remember seeing the huts, 
and then there was a bit of a scramble among the 
people, who is going to  get wh ich hut. And as
 we were a group of 14 people, same 
family, we did Œ we managed to get one
 hut just for our family, and that I 
remember as being something that everyb
ody thought was a very positive thing.  
Q: Can you describe a typical day there? 

A: In the beginning there was utter confus
ion. We had to like register, we had to 
get our fo od cards. And they to ld us that
 we would go to sc
hool, children would go 
to school and th ey™re go Œ 
and the adults would go to  wo rk. And then there was 
que Œ they talked a lo
t about wh at type of work  and 
everybody was sort of Œ it was 
also a new experience for all of us to 
have to work. I mean
, my mother never 
work ed a day in her life, and ma Œ and mo
st other women certainly didn™t, and the 

type of work  that they had was heavy,
 physical work. But the early work was 

actually cutting the Œ what was it, the grass. 
It was tall grass that th ey cut and they 
gave us these sickles, that
™s wha Œ th-the Œ like knives. And all Œ that™s what the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
45
first work was. The children 
did not do it, we did not do 
it, the adults did it. And 
they gathered it and tied it, and it was still 
very hot when we go
t there in August, it 
was very, very hot. It™s a short summer. 
Soon after that, the typical day was going 
to school. And they  did not have enough 
ch ildren to have a second grade, wh ich I 
should have gone to, cause 
I already knew how to read 
and write in Polish, and I 
was eight years old. So Œ but they only 
had enough children for a first grade and 
for a third grade, so I was 
in the first grade, and we 
started learning Russian. And 
school was important. They  did m-make it ab
solutely clear that we had to go to 
school in order to get our food, and scho
ol was important, and they were rather 
nice to us in school. The teacher was ni
ce, and they kept telling us about, you 
know, 
Stalin
 and how he was going to  take car
e of us, and how we are going to 
get presents from him,  and actually wh en Ch
ristma s came around, th ey told  us that 

we should pray for candy, and of course 
we didn™t get any and th en we should ask 
Stalin
 and the candy appeared. She distri
buted it and so on. Actually, this 
particular incident was very well portray
ed in the film Œ what was it called? 
ﬁEuropa Eu ropa
.
ﬂ
 Exactly he had the iden tical thing happen to him that I 
reme mb er very vividly, the same  conver
sation in school. Anyw
ay, so our typical 
days, wet Œ it very soon got very cold
. There™s very Œ there™s practically no 
transition. We started having th e first s
now by end of September, beginning of 
October, and that snow never, ever melts. 
So when we were walking to school, we 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
46
were walking like in a Œ in a ditch, a
nd on both sides there we
re these walls of 
snow that were as tall as I 
was. It  was cut out, so that
 if walked in, an-and that 
snow never, ever melted, so
 Œ until the next spring, obviously. And th e grown-ups 
went off and did wh atever they were doi
ng, I didn™t see them. And the thing was 
to get some of the wood for 
us to make fire in the hu
t. My grandmother sort of 
cooked something. I don™t remember ever 
being really hungry. We did have some 
food, and so I don™t remember ev er bei
ng really hungry. I do 
remember going to 
the store and getting Œ with those rati
on cards and getting our
 allocations. And 
they were mostly so
me sort of staples, I think.
 Certainly no vegetables, no Œ no 
food, no nothing, so that was bad, because 
we were very deprived
 of Œ of vitamins 
and Œ and that kind of nutrition. There 
was a little town not far away, where from 
time to time people were summo ned for 
various reasons, and there was always a 
great deal of trepidation and fear attach
ed to that, because you didn™t know Œ it 
was usually somebody that they either want
ed to recruit for so
me other work, or it 
was some oth Œ or they suspected so
mebody of being wh at they called the 
bourgoi
(ph) you know, before the war, and 
they wanted to look into it. Two 
young people from the settlement tried to ru
n away to Œ to th
e Manchurian border, 
we were not far from 
Manchuria
. It™s pretty far out there. So, a-and they either 
were caught, or they were Œ there was 
some mystery. I mean, I was only eight 
years old, but I remember the excitement th
at thi Œ were they caught, weren™t they 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
47
caught, did they freeze to death, didn™t th
ey freeze to death. 
But when they were 
missing, th-th-th-th-the 
NKVD
, which then became the 
[indecipherable]
 who 
came around and asked questio
ns, you know, the Russian
 secret service, or 
whatever they were. The poli
ce. So there was some contact to Œ to that little city, 
which was not far away. It was called 
Auga
(ph). And so, the typical day was just, 
go to  wo rk or go to school and eat and sl
eep. Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a 
terrible pest, and other than that I can™t 
really remember that
 mu ch, except big 
discussions inside with my  Œ I had one of
 my  cousins was already 15 years old, 

and he had been quite a go
od student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of 
history, and his sort of view of th e situa
tion was that we™ll never get out of there. 
This is where the Russians send their political
 enemies, h ave done
 so during Tsar™s 
time and have done so, you know, during 
th e purges, and are doing it now. And 
none of th ese people ev er get out. And of
 course my  view of history was limited, 
but I do remember arguments 
because my  mo ther particul
arly said you can™t take 
that kind of point of view, and it doesn™
t have necessary to be like that, and we 
will get out, it™s different. There™s a war a
nd they will be defeated at some point, 
and things will change. Anyway, thos
e discussions I do remember, and I 
reme mb er him saying there™s a Polish sayi
ng that these are dreams o f a severed 
head. So, whenever 
my  mo ther would hold out th
ese optimistic speeches, he 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
48
would say, these are dreams of a severed 
head. So that™s what I remember from 
there. 

Q: What do you attribute Œ and again I kn
ow you were only eight years old Œ your 
mother™s optimism to? Was she Œ had sh
e always been that Œ that way? 
A: She Œ it was not a stupid optimism, sh
e was very clever, and sophisticated 
woman, who lived in  various places in 
Europe
 and so on. I don™t know whether it 
was just a sort of simplistic optimism, it
 was the kind of optimism that she had 
throughout the war later, in
 much worse circumstances,
 where she felt that we 
would su rvive. And it wasn™t the rosy kind
 of optimism, it was 
just her kindof 
feeling that we would survive. And she 
was very good Œ I now understand it better 
than I did then, in Œ in making us believe
 it, that I always believed, I Œ later on 
also, that we would survive. And that sh
e had this way of making us feel very 
important and very special, because of
 pre-war connections, because of her 
experience before the war, b
ecause of the way Œ because 
of who my father was. I 
see it all as Œ now as Œ not
 as significant as sh e thought it was, but it helped 
survive the war, so I can™t 
even fault her. When I beca me a little older I started 
thinking that maybe she™s 
exaggerating. But it worked. 
Q: What did you talk about w
ith friends, or di Œ first of
 all, did you make friends 
there? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
49
A: No, I only ha Œ rememb er playing and 
talking and being with
 my two cousins, 
and they  are Œ they™re both girls. And sh 
Œ one of them was a year younger than I, 
and one is a year older.
 And they now live in 
Israel
 and I™m still friendly and close 
to them Œ no, schoolwork, 
schoolwork . Wh o could write Œ that™s what we talked 
about, who could write the lines neate
r, who could read Russian better, do the 
arithmetic. I don™t remember talking abou
t any significant things. No, da-daily Œ 
daily occu rrence.  
Q: Did Œ did you go to school on th e weekend? 
A: I don™t rememb er, probably Saturday , yes,
 Saturday we went to school, Sunday 
we didn™t go. There was one free da
y, I don™t remember what it was. 
Q: And what did you do? 
A: Stayed inside and played
 some word  games, a lot of word games, because we 
didn™t have toys. Lots of wo rd games, 
string games. We had strings, and so I 
remember doing this cat™s crad
le. And jump ing games like 
hopsco tch, that kind of 
thing. But it was a t Œ it was tight quarters and there were no streets. So it was sort 

of all invented, and it was more in the cen ter Œ there was a room in the center of 

that hut, and we sort of played there. 
It™s hard to say exactly what we did. 
Q: And the sleepi
ng conditions were? 
A: They Œ terrible. There was one long 
bunk and we all slept on th is one long 
bunk, all 14 of us. And this is Œ to this 
day I have a thing about that, because it was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
50
so tight that when one person turned, ev
erybody had to  turn, 
because you all had 
to be sort of lined up like 
sardines in the same directi
on. So it was Œ that was very, 
very un Œ bad. And to th is day I can™t 
sleep with anybody because it Œ it™s Œ just 
the thought of having somebody next to
 me when I sleep, I can™t stan d.  
Q: Did you have enough blankets? 
A: We used Œ I think we c
overed ourselves also with 
our clothes, or coats or 
jackets and we also slept 
clothesed
. We didn™t sleep in pajama s, we did sleep 
clothesed
. 
Q: How did you keep  yourself clean? 

A: Again, I don™t remember, there was th 
Œ yes, I do remember. They heated water 
and they  put the Œ like a basin or a thi
ng made out of wood, actually, and Œ like 
you see in very old Œ 

Q: Like a bucket? 

A: Oh yeah, exactly. And y
ou washed first the bottom an
d the top or vice-a-versa, 
yes, in the kitchen, when it was warm. A
nd it didn™t happen certainly, every day. 
There was no bathro om. 

Q: And sanitary facilities, toilet? 
A: Outside, outside. 
Q: Outside. 

A: An outhouse. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
51
Q: An outhouse. 
A: An outhouse, or Œ or yo
u just went anywhere, because it all froze anyway , right 
away, so there was no problem with that. 
But it was an outhouse. Very cold going 
out. No  bathroom inside. 

Q: Now you had said earlier that you ha
d been, when  you we
re very young, you 
were raised by a governess. And obviously
 the conditions had changed in so many 
ways. And so you were with your mo ther 
even more so under 
these derry Œ very  
difficult conditions Œ 

A: Well, there™s an interesting story actua
lly. Both our govern ess and my  cousin™s 
governess was deported with us, because 
they  happened to have been with us 
when they were Œ they still 
were with us when Œ when 
we got deported. And that 
was actually interesting, becau
se as soon as we got to 
Siberia
, they were working 
girls, so they thought that
 they deserved different co
nditions from us. They were 
not capitalists. And particularly my Œ my  Œ 
our govern ess apparently  was a very si 
Œ was a bit of a communist and a socially
 conscious person, an
d she Œ sh Œ they  
left. The two gir Œ th e two young women left
 us, they lived someplace else. One of 
them I later found out had some sort of 
a relationship with some local one of the 
guard s or something. And one of them appa
rently did get married there and stayed 

there and never left 
Russia
. So these were tw o young gi
rls, and so anyhow, they 
sort of evaporated after we got there, 
with some bad feelings, because both my

aunt and my  mo ther thought 
they weren™t very  loyal, but
 they saw this as maybe 
some sort of an opportunity
 of not being, you know, 
employed by these people any 
more. So I don™t think my Œ 
my  mo ther could pay. It wo
uld have been Œ if they 
had stayed  it would have been more out 
of loyalty, and apparently that did not 
happen.  
Q: But my  question was, how did this ch
ange your relationship with  your mo ther 
now that it was you and she in close quarters. 
A: Very much, very 
much so. But I think it™s a little
 bit like Œ like Œ from what I 
remember, it was more like in a kibbut
z, you know? The ch
il Œ everybody was 
together, so it was not only my  mo ther who 
told us what to do, but my  aunt and 
my  grandmother, I mean ev-everybody wa
s telling the children what to do. My Œ 
my  mo ther was Œ my  Œ the relationship was 
good, except that sh
e always was very 
concerned about my  brother, wh o was yo
unger, and who was very Œ somewhat 
sickly. And my  Œ my  aunt, my  two cousins™
 mother was very, very strict. So I felt 
sort of very privileged becau
se my mother was not very strict. And Œ not strict at 
all, as a matter of fact, she was not a di
sciplinarian and sh e Œ we had it Œ we had a 
good relationship. It was only difficult to watch her because she was terribly 
concerned and nervous about 
what happened to Œ to  my  father, and there was a 
constant sort of tension. I almo st sometim
es had the feeling that
 you know, if th Œ

it™s no use talking ab out it all the time, th
at whatever happens, happens, you know. 
It was oppressive to hear about that
 all the time. And but otherwise I Œ 
Q: Do you know if Œ what action sh
e took to try to get information? 
A: Yes, she Œ she was in some way resourceful. What she did was each time th ere 
was an opportunity to
 talk to one of the Russian 
guards, wh ich was at work , and 
this she told us in 
the evening about, or wh
en she got her rationcards, or when she 
Œ whenever there was some contact, she w
ould ask. Of course, these people were 
minor. Today I see how minor they were. 
These were minor guards and th ey had 
no id ea what happened, you know, 3,000 kilo
meters back east, to
 my father. So it 
was sort of useless. I tho
ught even at eight that she™
s being a terrible nuisance to 
them. But she did do that a
ll the time. And as a matter o f fact, she Œ she was once 

called, I don™t know why, she was called e
ither because of wo rk, or because of 
some ration cards, or because of some pe
rmits to go to the city, I don™t know, she 
was called to the encava Œ the office, and 
she went there, and as usual she com Œ 
told them that Œ about my father, and sh
e tried to evoke some pity in them. And 

there was a large age difference between 
my parents and so she said he Œ you 

know that she Œ first of all she didn™t want
 to say that he owned th e bank, because 
that Œ you know. So sh e Œ but she said that 
he™s older and th at he is sickly and that 
she™s terrib ly worried about him and so  on. And then this official ask ed her, what 
did he do? So she said well, he was a ba
nk clerk. So he said, so what are you so 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

54
upset about? You are young and you are be
autiful and you™ll Œ we have lots of 
bank clerks in 
Russia
 and you™ll find a young one that 
he won™t be sick. So don™t 
be so upset. So she came home and to ld th
at story in very Œ it was very funny the 
way she told  it. And so I know that she wa
s constantly  doing that. It didn™t help 
terribly mu ch, but she was doing it. 
Q: Were there any particular sights or sm
ells in that time th
at stayed with you? 
A: Snow. Lots and lots of snow. No sm
ells, no sights, we 
didn™t go anywhere, it 
was just the snow in hut and the little na
rrow walkway to the school and from the 

school, and that™s all I re
me mb er from that. And th e schoolroom was pleasant and 
warm, that I remember, that
 it was pleasant and warm. 
Q: And this routine went on for how long? 

A: This routine went on 
until about April. It starte
d in September, October, soon 
as we got Œ 

Q: April 1941? 
A: April 1941, right. And in  Ap ril she was Œ my  mo ther was summ oned by them, 
and told that if she wanted to, sh
e could leave, she could go back to  
Poland
 with  
the two ch ildren. And of course, she coul
dn™t believe her ears, I mean, sh-she 
couldn™t believe that they were saying that
, and she thought it was some sort of a Œ 
of a plan to trick her to Œ to Œ sh e just 
couldn™t believe it, no on
e had been set free. 
And so she said she just lis
tened to them, and then sh
e said, how will I go back, I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

55
don™t Œ you know, I don™t have money to 
buy a ticket, I don™t Œ you know, how do 
I go Œ so they said, why don™t you ask yo
ur brother to send y
ou money to get a Œ 
to buy the ticket for the transiber 
Œ she had to buy a ticket for the 
Trans
-
Siberia
 
railroad, wh ich went from 
Vladivostok
 all the way down 
Œ back to Œ to 
Mo scow
. 
But Œ and then we still were a day, or 
many hours by horse a
nd buggy away from 
that last station. But anyway, so she said
 she was afraid that they were trying to 
trick her into saying that my uncle had th
e money to buy it. So she didn™t Œ so she 
said, I don™t know Œ he doesn™t have that 
kind of money to buy the ticket. So he s 
Œ so this guard said to her, okay, so if 
he doesn™t send you a tic
ket, then you won™t 
go back. So at that point she thought mayb
e she was overplaying her cards here, so 
she said, okay, she™ll write to him and he
™ll make a collection among his friends. 
And at that point the guard appa
rently got upset and said, in 
Russia
 we don™t make 
collections. His honor was hurt. So she said, well, I™ll w rite to him and see 
whatever he wants to do. And she got out 
of that one, and actually when  she did 
write that they said that Œ that we coul
d leave, but she needed the money fo r the 
passage and so on, he though
t also that it was some sort of a trick. And he asked 
her for her password. He asked her the name
 of a cousin that they had actually 
here in 
America
, who had left 
Poland
 in the early 20s, or whatever, her first 
name. And when  she gave that Œ when  sh
e wrote it back, he did send the money. 
And at that point, she went with  the mone
y and sh e was told that we could leave,

and we left in May. We Œ we went to the 
train, just my  brother and Œ and she Œ and 
my  mo ther and I, and we went to Œ to Œ 
th ey provided  us w
ith transportation from 
where we were, to the end station. And I 
remember that trip very clearly because 
we had to  wait overn ight in Œ at this 
train station, wh ich also was not very 
pleasant, it was very cold. 

Q: What were Œ two questions, what were 
your thoughts about 
leaving? What was 
your reaction when your mother told
 you that you would be leaving? 
A: I was very, very excited, and I didn™t
 know Œ I had the same feeling she had, 
that we were afraid, because everybody, he
r parents and my aunt and the rest of 
the family said, who knows where they
™re taking you? Who knows why they ™re 
singling you out? Wh o knows what they™
ll do to you? And my mother™s answer 
was, that if they wanted  Œ and which wa
s very clever, if th
ey wanted to do 
something to  her, or wh at Œ then  they didn
™t have to Œ to put 
on this whole act, 
they could do it right here, they could just
 take her away and do it. So  they didn™t 
have to have this whole pro
duction. Therefore, she did trust that this is legitimate, 
that they want to send us b
ack for some reaso n  that she 
couldn™t figure out. And of 
course, neither could I. And I rememb er just
 that we were ta Œ you know, people Œ 
people in general, other people; there 
were friends, and peopl
e she worked with, 
and ev erybody came to say goodbye to 
us, but there was a lot of, you know, 
should she go, shouldn™t sh
e go there for Œ for Œ for weeks, I remember these 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
57
discussions, should she go, shouldn™t she go.
 And she decided she wanted to  go 
and you know, and Œ did I Œ 
Q: Did she say anything about leav
ing her parents and other relatives? 
A: No, she was rather independen t and 
she Œ I would say no. I think she Œ she 
trusted Œ she loved her brother, so she 
knew she was going to  him. She knew she 
was going back to 
Europe
. She knew, you know, that 
it was going to be less cold 
and less mi serable, and she wouldn™t be l
oo Œ so in other words, she knew Œ she 
felt that it was going to be better, whatev
er it is, it™s going to be better. And 
certainly better for us children,
 particularly for my  brother. 
Q: Even though she left her parents? 

A: Oh yeah. My mo ther was not Œ how sha
ll I say? She was not that attached to 
her family. She had married, liv
ed abroad and it™s not that
 she didn™t like them, but 
she felt that Œ that this 
was something that she Œ 
Q: Opportunity she Œ 

A: Yes, absolutely, and she was not 
the clinging type, no, absolutely not. 
Q: Did you say anything special when you
 said goodbye to your relatives Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ do you rememb
er saying anything? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er saying anythi
ng, no. Just goodbye and should Œ how 
should I say? I was glad to be rid of 
my aunt, I really was. What else? My 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
58
grandmother was very quiet, my  grandfather Œ no, I don™t rememb er saying 
anything, no, mm-mm, no. 

Q: What did you all take 
with you when you left?  
A: Whatever we were wearing. We didn™t 
have anything to take with us. By  then 

we had nothing, you know, precious or an
ything. No, I don™t remember Œ all Œ all I 
remember is that she always watched very
 carefully her Œ the 
identity, the papers. 
The papers were very impor
tant, you know, th-the Œ th e Œ the permits, the various 
permits that she needed . Sh e did have to 
go back several times to get all of the 
permits and the train tickets, and the Œ all 
of that I remember, there was constantly 
talk about, you know, where 
to keep it and how to keep 
it to make sure she has i t 
and all that, yeah. 

Q: So now you™re at the train station. 

A: So now we™re at the train statio n and 
the train arrived. We
 got on it and we had 
a compartment, and in the 
compartment there were two Œ there were bunk beds, 
and there was a Œ this I also don™t reme mb er, my  brother and I had a bunk 

down stairs and there was another man in 
the compartment, wh
o actually was with 
us the whole time. Whether he slept in th
at compartment or sl
ept across in another 
co mp artme n t, I d on ™t so meh ow rememb er, b u
t I do rememb er that he used to  take 

me and my  brother to the restaurant car a
nd gave us Œ and bought us hot chocolate. 

And that to us was such a treat, you see,
 this is the kind of
 thing I do reme mb er, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
59
that he sought Œ and my  mo ther suspected,
 later on when she used to talk about it, 
that he was actually planted to sort of 
take care of us and, you know, planted by 
them to Œ to Œ to be nice to us and al
so maybe to watch us. Not that we had any 
place to go, we had no place
 she could have gone. Bu
t he was there for some 
strange reason, he was there in a way that 
Œ that Œ that we couldn™t make out why 
he was there, and he was there Œ maybe 
he was just Œ maybe it Œ it wasn™t so, 
maybe he just traveled, and he happened to  
be a friendly guy, and Œ so there™s na Œ 
I don™t know. But he sort of stayed ar
ound and the whole time Œ it™s a long trip, 
it™s 11 days. So Œ and th en we got to 
Moscow
. 
Q: Did you ever get off the train? 

A: In
 Mo sco w
. 
Q: Not Œ but not in Œ 
A: Sometimes on the platform we woul
d just get off, because the Œ the Œ 
Q: Stretch. 
A: Œ yes, th-th Œ because Œ the train wasenormously comfortabl
e. Thebeds were 
made with linens, I mean, th is was super luxury for us, 
super luxury. We got very 
good food, decent food on the train an
d always hot water, what they called 
kipyatok
. And then  he would get us the hot c
hocolate. It was not bad, it was, by 
our standards this was top l
uxury. And when
 we got to 
Moscow
 we had to 
interrupt the trip and I don™t know if we 
had to wait for another train, but I know 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996

where Œ we had a few hours 
and he took us sightseeing. 
So he was, you know, he 
took us Œ he Œ he had a 
horse and buggy. And in 
Kiev
, because we passed through 
Kiev
 also, and in 
Kiev
 Œ he was gone already, but we
 went Œ you know, he left in 
Moscow
, he didn™t continue with us. In
 Kiev
 my  mo ther hired a horse and buggy, 
and we went around and sh e Œ she 
was very excited about being in 
Kiev
, and she 
knew a lot about 
Kiev
, and she was trying to sh ow us 
the city, city is quite nice, by 
the way. And Œ well, my  only memo ry from th
ere is that as we were riding, they Œ 
my  brother noticed a broken egg on the stre
et, and he started yelling, an egg, an  
egg. And this egg sticks in my  mi nd to  
this day. To him the whole city wasn™t 
important, but that somebody 
could have dropped an actu
al egg and wasted it, was 
like, you know Œ so  I remember that ride in 
Kiev
. What I remember most vividly 
is arriving in Œ in 
Lwów
, because when we arrived in 
Lwów
 my  uncle was waiting 
on the platform, and that I remember as 
being an enormously  emotional reunion, 
but really, I mean she was very, very ex
cited and very happy,
 and I was too, I 
mean, you know, here we were, we had a
rrived and everything was all right, and 
so on. And I also remember th
at he helped us with the little bit of luggage we had. 
And he had a man with him, some body w
ho helped him, who I later found out was 
like his, kind of manservant, who did lots
 of things for him also, in connection 
with pack ing, antiques, and delivering thin
gs and so  on. So  he wasn ™t like a house 
servant, he was more like 
a helper. So he helped with
 the luggage. And we got i-

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

61
into a taxi, we actually got into a car, a
nd wh ile we were going to  Œ to , I imagine 
where he lived, because we were suppose
d to go to his, I guess to hi Œ he was 
taking us to his house. Wh
ile we were going there, my
 mo ther asked wh ether he 
had heard something about my  
father, was the usual thing. And he said, as a matter 
of fact he had. And he said Œ and so mo ther
 started saying, is he all right, is he all 
right? And he said yes, actually, he™s all 
right, he™s well. And the whole ride was 
not very long, mu st have b
een Œ I™ve been back there 
since, it™ s a sh ort distance, 
mu st have been five or 10 minute ride. 
During those 10 minutes he prepared her 
that my father was actually there. And wh
en we got to the bu
ilding, there was my 
father standing and she fainted. My mo ther 
fainted, they had to carry her out, she 
screamed. And that I remember v ery vivi
dly, I remember that was very moving 
and very, you know, I mean so unexpected. 
And I hadn™t seen my father in over a 
year and a half or whatever it was, and 
it Œ and that was very exciting. And then  
we went upstairs and they ta
lked and talked and talked 
and talked. And that was it. 
[break] 
Q: We were talking ab
out your arrival in 
Lwów
 and your Œ you and your mo ther 
and your brother seeing your 
father for the first time.  
A: Right. And Œ and the reason he didn™t 
come to the railroad
 station was because 
Œ my  uncle and he had decided th at it wa
s very important to prepare her slowly, 
but since the distance from the 
railroad station to his hous
e was very short, so even 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
62
the slow preparation was not really slow en ough, and the impact was enormo us 
and she fain ted and carried on, and so on. 
And then we went upstairs and I re Œ I 
just remember that they ta
lked and talked and talked 
and talked. And th at was Œ 
that was it. And then we fo
und out that my  father had 
Œ well, he had his own set 
of, you know, what he went thro ugh, but the reason we
 were set free was because 
they Œ a relative here in 
New York
 had bought in 
Switzerland
, or gotten in  
Switzerland
, Bolivian passports which were actu
ally Œ they were almo st genuine, 
they were not completely fa
lse. They were issued by th e consulate Œ the Bolivian 

consulate in 
Zu rich
, which Œ they were not issu
ed by the government of 
Bolivia
. 
They  had booklets and they had stamps a
nd the consuls very of
ten did it for their 
own gain . And so Œ but they were mo re 
legitimate than the ones who were later 

prod Œ you know, manufacture
d right Œ right th en in 
Poland
 and wherever. So, 
anyhow, he had gotten the Œ 
these Bolivian passports, and 
my father, while he was 
in jail, and he ha Œ was m
oved during the 18 months he 
was in jail, he was moved 
to 11 different jails. T h ey move people 
constantly. And the interrogations started 
from Œ from the beginning in each particular
 jail. My father never knew whether it 
was because they didn™t have records, 
or whether it was a purposeful thing to 
exhaust people. Interrogations were always 
at night he told us, and the first few 

jails he was treated terribly, and he rea
lly suffered hunger. And later Œ and he, on 
the other hand, did someth ing different which work ed out well. He convinced 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
63
them that he was actually more important th
an he was. He trie
d Œ he did not play 
the 
[indecipherable]
 because he thought that it w
ouldn™t work anyway. He was a 
very imposing, good-looking, tall man, a
nd he spoke five languages fluently, was 
educated in 
Germany
. And so he was a personality. And he was afraid that if he 
tried to tell them that Œ wh
o he wasn™t, they would find out who he was, and then 
that would be worse. So he sort of even 
Œ he told them who he was, and he told 
them that he had very  good connections
 abroad. He did do so me dealings with 
Lehman 
Brothers here in 
America
, he had some dealings with 
Bernard Baruch
, 
he did do that. Probably no
t as much as he told them
, but Œ and they felt maybe 
that it was worth saving him and sending hi
m abroad. And so when
 he Œ they told 
my father that if he wanted to contact hi
s Œ his relatives and ask th em to help him 
by sending in foreign papers, they would 
release him, and that™s what happened. 
But we didn™t know anything about that in 
Siberia
, so when  these passports 
arrived, they notif Œ they called my
 father one Œ by then he was in 
La  Luby anka
. 
At the end, the last three or four months he was at 
La Lubyanka
. By the way, it™s 
a very luxurious prison. He had a beautiful 
room he told  us, with Persian rugs, and 
they treated him like a king
. Wonderful food, he went out
 for a walk every day. 
Those were the people Œ you never knew in 
Russia
 what was going to  happen Œ 
those were the people that they subseque
ntly probably releas
ed. Anyhow, to make 
a long story short, he said that they no
tified him one day that the passports had 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

64
arrived, and he would be able to leave wh
en ev er he felt like it. And at that point, 
he said he wasn™t going 
to leave until he found out 
what happened to us. Took 
them three months to lo cate us. And th ree 
months later, I forgot to say, the first 
time they called my mother, th
ey asked her to  give them a picture of herself and 
the two ch ildren, and th ey didn™t say w
hy. And that picture took th em a long time 
to send it from 
Siberia
 to
 Moscow
, and it actually came to the 
Luby anka
 and the 
Œ the inspector showed
 it to my father and said, is 
this your wife? We found her, 
we know now where she is. And th at™s when
 they told  us to go back, or sent us 
back. So there was some rhyme and reason 
to it, and that™s when Œ and Œ and they 
released him, or he left on hi Œ of his 
own free will. He was Œ when Œ when they 
told him that we got on the train. So th
at™s how we were reun
ited, and we had now 
these Bolivian passports. And we we
re supposed to leave on the 24
th
 of June, 
1941, and we were supposed to  go all the way east again, via
 Japan
 to leave 
Russia
, and to go to, presumably 
Bolivia
 at some point. But the 22
nd
 of June, 
Germany
 invaded 
Russia
, and so we never made it. 
We had everything, we Œ we 
had the train tickets, we were packed, we 
had everything. So  that was a very bad 
break for us because we Œ th
e da Œ the Russians evacuated
 very efficiently. I mean, 
they Œ they left, and they di
dn™t take anyone with them
. We tried to ask them to 
take us with them, but ther
e was no way, they weren™t go
ing to take any civilians 
at all, and they didn™t. And 
so we Œ we stayed in Œ in 
Lwów
. And I remember w e

were in the cellar at night, because they
 were shooting and bomb ing. Not bomb ing 
so much, but shooting. Ther
e was a war. And during th e night, I rememb er there 
was this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, 
an d  my  mo th er said , 
the Russians are gone, these are the German
s, and I rememb er say Œ sort of Œ I 
always thought that she knew too mu ch 
befo re anyone else did, she Œ and 
sometimes she was wrong, but very Œ mo st
 of the time she was right. And I said, 
how do you know? And she 
said, because they march 
differently. And su re was 
she right, they marched differently. And in
 the morning, there they were. And so 
that was the hard Œ th at was hard, becaus
e we were lucky in the way that we had 
the Bolivian passports, so we
 did not Œ we were not in
 the ghetto. 
The ghetto in 
Lwów
 was established very, very  quick ly, 
because they already had experience 
from 
Kraków
 and
 Warsa w
 and all that, so they Œ in 
Lwów
 it went very, very  
quick ly. And we couldn™t go out, becaus
e they were rounding up children in the 
street, they were rounding up people, th
ey were rounding Œ you know, and they  
had these 
rà tzia s
 as th ey called them, they roun
ded up people, so my  parents 
didn™t Œ th-th-they were afraid to let us 
out in the street b ecau
se Œ or themselves, 
for that matter, because they
 knew that these Bolivian 
passports Œ you know, they 
Œ they were safe Œ th-there was talk 
that the Œ we would be exchanged fo r 
prisoners. As you know, these talks went
 on and on and some 
people were sent, 
and actually Œ I don™t know if anyone wa
s actually exch anged, but some people

were deported and to ld that they would 
be held, and would be exch anged. These 
foreigners. Some people really had real 
foreign passports because the husban d was 
Œ had left 
Poland
 before and sent the passport, wa
s living already in Œ in one of 
the South American countries, and so on
, and the wife was supposed to follow. 
And so there were some real legitimate 
ones. Ours were not
 a hundred percent 
legitimate, but that didn™t ma
ke that much difference.  
Q: What was it like for you to see a German soldier? 
A: Scary. Very, very scary, because 
they looked superhuman, they  looked like 
gods, and I Œ I often had the 
Œ the feeling that maybe if we would look like they 
did, or be dressed like they did, and have
 these shiny boots th
at they had, then  
maybe we Œ they wouldn™t hate us so mu
ch. In other word s, I reme mb er strongly 
feeling that they were superior. I believed th
ey were superior at that time, they did 
Œ they Œ they  Œ they  look mighty and Œ and 
superhuman. So I Œ I was just afraid of 
them, but not Œ but at the same time I t
hought they were great, you know, th ey 
were the Œ they were Œ they were awesom
e, that™s what they were. I remember 
reading one of 
Elie Wiesel™s 
early books, and Œ wh ere he talks about the same Œ 
that he had sometimes the same so rt of fee
ling, that if he looked  Œ you know, if he 
could look like them, they wouldn™t hate us
 so mu ch. So apparently children did 
have that kind of fantasy. So  I do rememb
er that. I remember being very afraid. I 
reme mb er Œ you asked me about relationships and so on, I reme mb er my  parents

at that point fighting all the time. A lot of
 tension, a lot of fighting, because the 
fights were always about wh at to do and 
what not to do. And my  mo ther Œ my  
father was a very law abiding sort of strai
ght kind of person, and he thought if he 
lay low with his Bolivian passports, th
ings would blow over. If he followed 
whatever directions, or what
ever ordinances they passed,
 and so on, then he would 
be all right, because you don™t Œ you don™
t do anything to somebody who™s a law 
abiding citizen. My mother had totally di
fferent ideas. My mo
ther felt that we 
would never survive if we just stayed th
ere, and we have to do something, and 
there was this constant fighting about wh
o was going to be guilty of us being 
killed and who wasn™t, and 
who Œ you know, this was 
[indecipherable]
 this was, 
and it was really constant. So I remember th
-that part of it. After a few Œ after Œ we 
were a year with the Germans in Œ in 
Lwów
, but after the first two or three 
months, my parents too Œ sent my  brot
her and me to the country, because by 
coincidence, the chauffeur 
that they employed befo re 
the war, his wife™s family 
came from that part of Œ of 
Poland
, and th ey had Œ they  we
re farmers, they had a 
farm, they were peasants. And so he was 
able to find that out, he Œ or I guess my  
father did, and they  paid them, and then
 my  brother and I st
ayed there for about 
two or three months Œ 
Q: Was it hard Œ 

A: Œ or fo ur months.

Q: Œ hard  for you to  leave Œ 
A: No Œ 

Q: Œ your mother? 
A: Œ no, I was so happy to  leave, becau
se it was safe, y ou know, it was quiet. And 
it was Œ it felt safe, and Œ 
Q: But even leaving your mother, wa
sn™t it hard at that young age? 
A: No, no I don™t think it was hard, becaus
e I don™t rememb er it as being hard , I 
remember thinking that Œ th
at this was going to  be quiet and safe, and that Œ and 

they also told us that it would be Œ we 
were a burden. They Œ they  made it very 
clear to us that we were a burden, because
 we Œ ye Œ they c
ould hide with grown-
ups, they  Œ subsequently  they
 were hidden by a German 
officer in his office. And 
wi Œ they  couldn™t do th at sort of thing 
with us children aro
und, so we knew that 
we had Œ that we were a kind of burd
en , and we had to  be taken care of 
somewhere else. So, I know it wasn™t bad,
 and these people were nice to us. 
Q: The two or three months you were in 
Lwów
, before you went to the country, 
what did you do? 

A: Nothing. We stayed home, we never we
nt out, we ju st Œ nothing. And there my  
mo ther was very good at creating paper ga
mes, pencil and paper games, and that Œ 
nothing. We couldn™t go out, you did noth in
g. You Œ you went crazy. Particularly 
my brother went crazy, because he was a 
little boy and he was lively. I see now, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

for instance, my grandchild
ren, if they have no pr
ogram on a Œ you know, then 
what Œ th-the Œ programs fo
r this and programs for that
 and so on. Noth ing, there 
was nothing. You didn™t do anything. Y
ou ju st Œ you just stayed around and 
listened to what the grown-ups were talk
ing about, and it wasn™t very cheerful, 
either. No, that was hard. You didn™t go
 to school, you did nothing, you did 
absolutely nothing. On e memo ry, vivid me
mo ry I actually have from Œ actually 
this happened before the Germans came, be
cause they Œ we were there for two or 
three months before, and I ha
d very, very bad teeth. I s
uppose because of the result 
of this year in 
Russia
 and I needed fillings, and thos
e were my permanent teeth, 
and they were Œ had enormous cavities in
 them, and I Œ oh, knitting. My mother 
taught me how to  knit and how to darn, an
d I did a lot of that because that was 
something to do all day long. So I had this knitting need le, and I could put it right 
through my front teeth, they were s Œ and I 
was supposed to go to
 the dentist, they 
had no Œ and you know, there were dentists 
[indecipherable]
 anyhow, they had no 
Novocain. So, to do th
at, they had to strap me to th
e table and Œ to the chair, which 
was, to this day when I go to a dentist, 
I have a terrible time. But anyway  Œ an d my  

parents were having one of their fights a
bout what to do. And I reme mb er staying 
Œ staying in my Œ I had like a little alcove
 where my bed was, and it was early in 
the mo rning, and I was supposed to go to 
the dentist that day, and I reme mb er say-
saying to  my self whether I should volunteer 
and say if they stop
ped fighting, then 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

I would go without crying and 
objecting, and I never made it. I was so afraid of 
this dentist and the strap and the pain, th
at I didn™t make it. I let them fight on, 
because I couldn™t bring myself to do th
at, to make that supreme sacrifice. 
Anyway , aft Œ so then we went out and we
 were in the countr
y. There I remember 
digging potatoes, which was great fun, by 
the way. And th en they  made fires, and 
they roasted the potatoes. 
I remember Christmas there,
 where we baked a Œ there 
we had something to do. That was, you see,
 the difference. I didn™t Œ we didn™t go 
out, because they didn™t want us to se
e the other farmers, and we didn™t go to 
church , and we didn™t Œ because th ey all 
went to church on S
unday, but we didn™t, 
we were actually hidden. So 
we only stayed on Œ in the 
field near to their house. 
And I remember the animals, I remember milking cows, I remember drinking milk 
straight from the cow. I remember feed
ing them, I reme mber the digging of 
potatoes. So  that was actually not Œ it was a 
peaceful kind of interlude, so to  speak. 
And Œ 
Q: Did you have any cont
act with your parents? 
A: Very little. He would go into the Œ 
Q: How? 
A: Œ yeah h Œ my parents would write 
little notes, you know, letters, and I would 
also write letters, I knew how to write. And 
he would go into the city and take the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

71
letters, and then they would write. Yes, 
we did have contact, but not spoken, 
written yeah. 
Q: Who made up Œ 
A: And then  Œ 
Q: Œ the farmer™s family? 

A: It was he and his wife and a daughter. There were just three of them. The 

daughter was actually a very pretty  girl, a
nd I reme mb er she had Œ she would sit in 
front of th e mirror and make Œ she mu st ha
ve been about 18 or 19 or wh atever, and 

make the hairdo like they did at
 that time, th ree sort of Œ 

Q: Rolls, curls? Okay. 
A: Œ round rolls this way, and th en  you 
pinned it with a pin. And then Œ and I Œ I 
remember thinking when I gr
ow up, that™s exactly the 
hairdo I™m going to have, I 
was so jealous of her. And Œ 
Q: Did th ey know ex actly who you were Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ that you were two Jewish children? 

A: Yes, yes. They got paid for it. Yes. Oh, they were paid, 
absolutely. But they 
were kind, I mean, you know, they were kind. They were Œ they
 were human, they 
were Œ they treated us like Œ like th
ey would any other relative children Œ 
Q: Did th ey try any ki
nd of converting on Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
72
A: No, no, no. But we had 
Œ we sort of fit in, yo
u know, when  they  were 
decorating the tree, we were decorating th
e tree. When they were baking cookies, 
we were baking cookies. But I know that we never went to  church there, because 
they didn™t want us to be all over the 
place, and people aski
ng too many questions, 
but when  somebody did come, like one of 
the neighbors or something, they said 
there were city Œ you know, children of so
me Œ somebody who work ed in th e city, 
a relative, and didn™t want 
the children there; things we
re hard in the city. Don™t 
forget that things were harder in cities 
always than in the 
country, there was a 
shortage of food by then , and all. But we 
were Œ we didn™t have
 too much contact. 
But they were nice to us, they
 didn™t mistreat us in an
y way at all. And then  one 
day he came back from the city
, and he told us that he 
has Œ that we are going to 
go to  Œ that my  parents are going to go to 
Hun g a r y
. And that they would take us Œ 
he took us by horse and buggy, or by car, I 
don™t even remember, b u t I took us to 
an estate th at was owned, or lived in 
by a German. And this 
German was supposed 
to help us get to the bord
er. Some Œ a German helped us, that™s how Œ my  Œ and 
I™ll tell you how that connection came. He
 had a relationship 
with a Polish woman 
who was a friend of somebody that my uncle knew. So  she hel Œ she helped 
several Polish and Jewish people through 
her relationship with him. And again, it 
was paid as well, but that was the connec tion. So what they 
did with us, they  
brought my brother and me there, 
we spend one night there. And Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

73
Q: The farmer brought you? 
A: Yes, and they Œ 

Q: What was the farmer™s name, do you remember? 
A: 
Boushlev ich
(ph) yes, I remember his last 
name because everybody called him 
Boushlevich
(ph). I don™t rememb er his first name. 
Boushlevich
(ph). And then he 
Œ he brought us there, he left us there,
 and we were there a few days before my 
parents arrived. And I know it was Augu
st, because it was over my birthday. And 
he showed up, this German, 
I™ll never forget that, and he
 asked me what I like best 
to eat. And I had a thing about tomatoes
, I loved tomatoes. 
And on my  birthday Œ 
he asked me when is my  birthday, it so 
happened  was in a few days, he brought 
me four tomatoes. I™ll never forget th
at. This was this 
German. And then Œ 
Q: His name? 
A: No, don™t remember, I was only there a 
few Œ I don™t even know her name, but 
I understand that she was killed right afte
r the war because she was considered a 
collaborator. These people didn™t live very 
long, so Œ but anyway, she Œ and so my  
par Œ and my  parents were hidden  in his 
office behind a wardrobe at the end, it 
was really Œ they couldn™t leave his office
, th ey were like behind a big wardrobe, a 
partition or something. I wasn™t there, so
 I don™t know, but my Œ but that™s what 
they told  me. And you see, and that™s w
hy it was important to get us out of the 
way, because you couldn™t hide us together
 like that. And then Œ then  my  par Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
74
you see, my parents at some point realized
 that they wo uld never surv ive, or that 
they would be deported with
 the Bolivian passport, th
at the Bolivian passports 
would not save them from deportations. 
And you see, there, there was a big 
difference of opinion between my  parents,
 because my  father believed that we 
would be exchanged, and my  mother said 
no way, this is all Œ you know, they™ll 
never exchange anybody fo r anybody. And th
ey™ll just take us like everybody else, 
and kill us. So the Œ in the 
end they made the decision that we would go illegally 
across the border to 
Hungary
. And Œ wh ich was a very risky business, but 
apparently they came to the conclusion 
that it would be less risky than staying 
with these Bolivian passports in 
Lwó w
. My uncle had gone before. He went 
before because he was Œ he didn™t have an
y foreign passport, a
nd he was what they 
dec Œ what they designated as a necessary 
Jew, because he helped  Œ just like he 
helped th e Russians to identif
y wh at they were robbing, 
he then did the same for 
the Germans, because they 
were Œ they were robbing 
things, and they had these 
warehouses where they stored them, and 
they had to decide what to take to 
Germany
, what to send to 
Germany
, what not to send to 
Germany
, what to steal, 
what not to steal for themse
lves, and so  on, so they ne
eded experts to tell them 
what™s good and wh at isn™t, you know, lik
e in every other area, you know, what is 
a good painting, wh at is a good carpet, wh
at is good ch ina, what is good silver, 
what is Œ and so  on. So my uncle got, 
since he had that kind of job with the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
75
Russians, he stayed on and they  took over this warehouse, and so he stayed with 
them. And he became Œ my uncle was a ve
ry charismatic person and became very 
friendly with the guy who ran this warehous
e. And so first he had like a certificate 
as a 
notwendig
 
Jude
, you know one of these Jews
 who were necessary for the 
German Reich. And then he was arrested
 twice and badly beaten and both times 
this German was able to get him out on 
th e Œ saying that he was a necessary 
person. But my uncle realized that this is
 not going to  wo rk a third time, besides he 
suffered terribly, was terribly beaten. And so 
he decided to Œ to 
take Œ to run Œ to 
escape to 
Hungary
, and then we followed. And I 
remember that crossing of the 
border, because that was a terrible experien
ce, because you see, they  kept saying, 
my  parents kept saying Œ I guess they Œ th
ey  knew about it and they didn™t try to 
hide it. Many of these guys, 
they were paid and then th
ey  took people directly to 
the nearest police outpost. And there wa
s no way you could pr
etend, I remember 
being totally, totally defenseless against 
that, because you were in a forest, and 
you had to cross Œ you didn™t cross on a 
road, you crossed like on trails. And you 

had to cross a river, there™s a river on the border of 
Germ any
 Œ of 
Poland
 and 
Hungary
. So Œ and they were the guides, they
 Œ they  were local people who knew 
how to Œ how to  get there. And Œ but if they
 turned left or right or straight, and Œ 
and took you somewhere else,  there was no 
way you could have prevented it, or Œ 
or even know. And that™s 
what happened  to many peop
le. So I knew about that, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
76
and I Œ I don™t know how I 
knew about it, because probably my  parents talked 
about it and Œ and I rememb er being terribly 
afraid that they would deliver us. So 
Œ but we didn™t Œ they were Œ they didn™t
, and Œ or he didn™t, was one guy. And 
what I remember about that is that when
 we were crossing the river, there was a 
strong so rt of current, and there were lik
e big rocks and it was slippery, and my  
father fell, or slipped and lo st his gla
sses. And that was a major problem, and he 
got terribly upset because he couldn™t 
see without his glasses, he was very 
nearsight
. And so I went next to him, or I so
rt of went back and I started looking 
for the glasses and I found them, they we
re caught behind the Œ and he talked 
about this as long as he lived, about these 
Œ that I found his glasses and th at saved 
whatever it saved. But the effect of 
all of this was that we arrived in 
Hungary
 near 
Munkács
, and we Œ 
Munkács 
was the nearest metropolis. And we arrived in the 
morning early, and we were Œ my father wa
s wet, and he was in a suit, and he was 
wet from the river. And it wasn™t so much
 that it was uncomfortable, it was in 
August, so it wasn™t cold, but as Œ as th
ey said late Œ it was dangero us, you know? 
Why would these people be dressed like th
at and wet and no place to go, in th e 
park. We went to a park, because that wa
s the Œ the most logical place to be. And 
what my father Œ what my parents with
 great bitterness recalled for years and 
years was that Œ see, 
Hungary
 had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews 
in 
Munkács
 Œ 
Munkács 
was a ve ry Jewish place, th ey were living there a normal

77
life, and my parents told Œ you know, approached a couple of people, my  father 
did, and told  them of Œ you know,
 that we had just escaped from 
Poland
 and 
would th ey help us. And nobody wanted to
 help us. No body. And it wasn™t even  Œ 
that™s what my parent were so bitte
r about, because it was Œ later on, you 
understood if somebody didn™t he
lp you, or the Poles, for th
at matter, if they didn™t 
help you during the occupation, because th
ey would be severely punished. Bu t at 
that point in 
Hungary
 there was no real danger yet of being severely punished, 
and yet they wanted no part. And we late
r Œ I read about it later a little, I think 
they thought if they had no
thing to do wi-with us, th
en the evil, and all this 
problem that™s coming from the east, 
somehow wouldn™t come to them. You 
know, but my parents were very bitter 
about it, I don™t know en ough about it. But 
finally somebody did take us in, and I re
member that it was on the outsk irts, and it 
was a Œ was not a Jewish family, some Œ 
some woman in the square told us to 
follow her, and she to ok us, and she had a ba
rn . And she told us we could stay in 
that barn. So  we dried out in th e barn, and she brought us some food. And in  the 

meantime, my father had so
me sort of a meeting point with Œ because my  uncle 
went ahead, and my  uncle was supposed  to
 arrange for Christian papers with a 
fake name for us. You see, we couldn™t sh
ow up as the same people with the same 
passports in Œ in 
Poland Œ 
in 
Hun g a r y
. You see, we had to then  reinvent, and I Œ 
ourselves and the new identity. 
So th-the idea was that in 
Hungary
 we would be 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
78
as Polish Christians, which 
Œ of whom there were many because there were some 
deserters from before the war, from the 
beginning of the war. And there was a 
colony of Po lish people there. So these papers came to 
Munkács
, and my father 
got them someplace, and they came with 
a man with a car, who my uncle arranged 
would take us to 
Budapest
 already with those papers. 
And those papers, that I ha 
Œ rememb er one of th e mo st frightening mo ments of my  war was that my  mo ther 
told us that from now on my
 name, or Œ for me, and my  brother too, my  name was, 
since I was always called 
Ria
(ph), that my name was 
Maria
, and the last name  
was 
Wolinsky
(ph). Our name before the war was 
Wohl
. So the simplest thing, 
they dropped the 
H
 and made it into a very  
nice Polish name, which was 
Wolinsky
(ph), so my name was 
Maria Wolinsky
(ph), or 
Wolinska
(ph) for that 
matter. And my  brother was 
Stefan
 always, so there was no problem, was 
Stefan 
Wolinsky
(ph) and my father was 
Athol
(ph) and my  mother was 
Gisele
. But, when 
we were Œ you see, the Œ 
Munkács 
in that area was stil
l the border, it was the 
border strip what they  called, and then th
ere was a post, a police post that you had 
to pass. And there they stopped all the 
cars and looked and Œ and you had to 
identify yourself, or whatever, identificati
on. And at that point, wh en they stopped 
us, my  mind went blank. I suddenly  co
uld not reme mb er whether our name now 
was 
Wolinsky
(ph) or 
Wolsky
(ph), which are very similar. And I was Œ and how I 
didn™t die of a heart attack, although ch
ildren don™t usually, but I was trembling 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
79
and I was petrified. And this guard spoke to  the driver, of course and the driver Œ 
they spoke Hungarian, we couldn™t unde
rstand a word . And th ey Œ he told them 
that we were some relatives or somethi
ng. I mean, it never came to us Œ to our 
having Œ it was all bribe Œ the Œ to identif
y ourselves, but I thought that it might, 

and I was sure that they would ask me my
 name, this was very important at that 
point, and I was very scared. And as soon as 
we started moving again, I said to my  

mother, I forgot what our name is. An
d she Œ and I was Œ you know, I Œ I saw 
myself also as being the Œ the one who cause
d everyone to  be wh atev er Œ so, killed 
or Œ or whatever. So my  mo ther said then
, don™t worry, she said, if you Œ if they 
had asked you fo r your name, we would 
have been lost anyway, no matter what 
they would have s Œ wh at th
ey would have Œ what you w
ould have said. So Œ but it 
was just, to show you how these th
ings were. So then we came to 
Budapest
 and in 
Budapest
 we stayed in a 
pensionne
. And we could not stay in the city, it was sort 
of in the outskirts of the city, but life 
was good. You had plen ty of food, we had 
comfortable rooms. Apparently life was enormously cheap in 
Hungary 
at that 
time. And my father went to
 the city quite often, I re
member, came back and then 
once he was Œ you see, the 
Œ the Œ the Hungarians were
 allies of the Germans. 
Gonna stop it.

Beginning Tape Three 
Q: This is tape three, side one, and you are now in  
Hungary
. 
A: Right, and we have just arrived, an
d we were actually sort of waiting. We 
stayed in this 
pensionne
. My father would go into 
Buda pest
, it was a train ride, a 
short train ride. He would meet my uncle,
 he would meet other people. The main 
busin ess of the day was some trading. You 
had to get some money. At that point 
my  mo ther sold some jewelry, partic
ularly one diamond pin about wh ich she 
talked a lot because she sa
id the things in Œ in 
Hungary
 were so inexpensive that 
we lived on that pin for one year. 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: This is a pin she had kept with her Œ 

A: Yes Œ 
Q: Œ all the time Œ  

A: Œ yes, she had it Œ 

Q: Œ even  to 
Siberia
? 
A: Œ she had jewelry Œ yes, yes, she kept 
a few things and she had it with her. And 
she sold that. And they
 were also trading in stones. 
There was a big trade going on 
in diamonds, in foreign currencies; do
llars, English pounds, and people were 
trading, the Jews and the non-Jews, th
-th-the Gentile refugees. There was a 
busin ess going on and people were trad
ing and that™s how people made some 
money, an d that™s what peop
le lived on. Because at that point, none of us were

really in hiding. We did Œ my  father di
d get held up or arrested at one point, 
because they were checking
 the legitimacy of his being there. So he had false 
papers, we had to have a permit to be Œ a 
residency permit, which we sort of got, 
but I know that he was in 
Budapest
, he wasn™t supposed to be there. Anyhow, he 
got caught, and then  they came and got us, 
th-the Œ the Œ this is all now Hungarian 
police. And, because he told
 them where that they Œ th
ey asked where we are, you 
know, and th ey knew he had family, or that
 he told them he had family, I don™t 
know, I wasn™t there. But th
ey did come and they arre
sted us. And we were put 
into a Œ they had like a detention camp, 
it was not a real prison, but it was like a 
detention camp in the center of 
Buda pest
. And th e danger there was that they 
would send us back to 
Poland
. 
Q: What were you Œ wh at were your
 thoughts when  you got arrested? 
A: Scared. We were scared because we we re afraid that they
 would send us back 
to
 Poland
. I knew better than anybody else, or 
certainly better than they that our 
papers were fake, our permits were fake, 
and if they caught on to  that, they did 
send Œ you see, they were a
llies of the Œ of the German
s. They were not occupied, 
but they were allies, an d if they found 
that somebody was really Jew ish, and was 
pretending to be Polish, and 
had no legitimate papers to 
be there, they did send 
some people back. And that was the danger. 
It wasn™t so much that the prison 
itself was so terrible. It was not very 
comfortable. They  separated women from

82
men. All I remember is that there was a cour
tyard in the center of 
it, that™s actu ally 
one of the nicer stories, with a huge tree
. And the Œ th e Œ my  Œ 
my father, when we 
lived in this 
pensionne
, we were not far from a forest
, and my  brother found, one 
day when we went for a walk, he found 
a baby squirrel that mu st have fallen out 
from the nest or whatever, and we took 
it home. And this baby squirrel, we had 
had him now maybe for a coupl
e of months wh en Œ wh en we got arrested. And he 
was tame, he was Œ he would sit in pe
ople™s pockets. He was quite destructive 
actually, he would ch ew things up. But of
 course, my  brother absolutely adored  
this squirrel, and to this day he loves s
quirrels, and I do too. And when my  father Œ 
when  they  arrested us, my  Œ they did go 
back with my father a day or two later, 
and Œ to pick up some thin
gs, you know, the necessities, 
and so  they Œ they went 
back with  my  father and he was supposed 
to pick up some things for us. And at 
that point the squirrel apparently  recogniz
ed him and came to him and jump ed into 
his pocket as he always did. And th ere he
 was, and this policeman had never seen 
a squirrel like that. And so 
he s Œ you know, the squirrel 
came back to prison, and 
he was there. And when  we got Œ when  he 
got there, we didn™t know what to do 
with him, cause you couldn™t keep him in
 the pocket all the time. So we let him go 
in the courtyard, and he went up and do
wn that tree. He became like Œ everybody 
loved him. And luck ily, we were released
 a few days later and the squirrel went 
home with us. But one of the other sort 
of mo re humorous thing Œ they Œ they  

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
83
examined our papers and decided it wa
s okay. But one of the mo re humorous 
things from that was that wh
en th ey interrogated you, 
you had these false papers, 
but you had to have
 Œ you know, they could ask 
you what was your mo ther™s 
maiden name, what was your grandmother™s
 maiden name, and so on. So people 
of course, and we weren™t the only ones who 
were in that situation, didn™t have all 
that information, nor did they
 Œ so they invented these names, and my mo ther used 
to tol Œ told a very funny story of this
 woman who was interro Œ who was asked, 
you know, interrogated, and wh en she was 
asked, she would look around and pick 
an object, and say, you know, 
tay-tabloska
(ph), you know, and ju st add the Polish 
ending to  it, you™d lo ok around. So  that
™s how things were
, you know, and Œ and 
you either got away  with it, or you didn™
t get away with it, 
depended. But anyway, 
so then we were there for 
another Œ mu st have been there about 10 days, and then 
they released it. 

Q: Were you ever questioned? 
A: No, no Œ 
Q: Wa Œ you were never questioned. 

A: Œ no, no. I memorized what my mother 
told us to memorize, we didn™t invent 
some sort of maiden names for my  gran
dmother and so on. And no, I was not mem 
Œ we also were taught very carefully 
by  my  mo th er, who  
knew those things, 
because she had been educated in Catho
lic schools, we were taught the basic 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

84
prayers, you know, th-the Holy  Mary, th
e Œ and Father, who are in heaven , the Œ 
the 
Pater Noster
, because as Christian children 
we obviously had to know these 
main things. So those things we knew 
backwards and forwards in Œ in Polish, 
quite, quite well. We were not questioned ab
out that. So then they released us and 
we went back to this place, 
but they told us that we c
ouldn™t stay there, because it 
was too close to 
Budapest
. And th ey had, at that tim
e th ey had some rules about 
Polish refugees in general. This was not 
directed against Jews. They did not want 
large concen trations of foreign refugees in 
Buda pest
, say they wanted them 
outside of 
Budapest
 in smaller villages and ar Œ and so  on, areas. So at that point 
Œ by the way, the squirrel, after he cam
e back about a week later, he grew, he 
became Œ a-and he left, he ran away. Prob
ably went back to the forest, once he 
was no lo nger a baby, he was gone. And my
 brother was very upset when  he Œ but 
Œ but he came back from prison, then he 
left. And then we Œ so then  we had to 
move, and we moved to an area that was Œ th
at they told us they
 Œ that we should 
be in, and it was not far from 
Budapest
, about an hour by train in 
Leányfalu
, and 
that was sort of a concentration of Polis
h refugees. We rented
 a villa. We could do 
that, we did Œ you know, within  the circumference of wh ere they wanted to Œ we 
could live the way we wanted to  live. Th
e only problem with that was that we 
were surrounded by Po les, and many of th
em not Jews. Some were Jews like us 
and some were not. More were not. And ther
e the theater started. You really had to 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
85
know how to pretend not to be Jewish
. And these Polish people, they knew. I 
mean, this was Œ this was all a Œ a theater. 
S o  there Œ first of all, we had a fairly 
normal life in the sense that we were not 
hiding, so my  mo ther decided to see if 
she could find so mebody to take care of
 my brother and of me, and teach us 
something. I mean, you Œ we 
had never been  to school ag
ain. And they Œ we were 
driving them also crazy. So  we Œ they 
took a Œ they found a lady who had been  a 
teacher before the war, and she was the 
wife of a Œ of a Œ she was Polish, not 
Jewish, and she was the wife, a young wife of a Polish deserter. Most of these 
Poles were actually somehow families of de
serters. You know, they deserted in 
1939 from this army that was 
falling ap art. And he was a tenor at the Œ at the opera 
in 
Poznan
 a Polish singer, and she was a tea c
her. And she was just as happy to 
work for us because she was paid, of co
urse. And she would come in the morning 
and she would take care of us all day long
. And I Œ that was a Œ very nice, because 
she would take us on picnics. She did find some Polish books. Sh e made up a 
schedule, you know, we read, and then 
she had dictation, and then  she had 
arithmetic, and then  she had lunch and Œ an
d we were with her all day long, and 
she invented Œ she even Œ we 
even staged a little Œ I think one of the pictures that Œ 

that I showed you th at you took was a st
aging of a Polish song
 in honor of my  
uncle™s birthday and so on. 
Q: Now, your uncle was w
ith you at this time? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
86
A: No, he did Œ yes, he was in 
Hungary
, and he was in 
Buda pest
, but he did not 
go with us Œ  
Q: He did not come with you Œ 
A: No, he did not live with us Œ 
Q: Œ to the village. 

A: Œ in this bucolic Œ no, he Œ when  he
 had some Polish friends, he stayed with 
them, he Œ he had to also sort of do so
me wheeling and dealing,
 because he had to 
earn some sort of living. My father has Œ 
was more fortunate, 
my father had more 
money, my father had my mother™s jewe
lry, he had Œ he ha
d some connections 
where he could get some money, he got some money from 
Switzerland
 th at point 
as well. So he was different, but my Œ my 
uncle really l ived by trading, you know, 
he would buy an tiques, sell antiques, ma
ke a commission. Buy and sell, that™s 
what Œ and Œ and Œ an d that™s what he 
did, an d he was a young, single person, I 
mean, his f amily was i n  
Siberia
, he had no contact at 
that point, he had no id ea 
whether they lived or
 died. Chances were they all 
lived, by the way. We did know 
that the people in Œ in 
Siberia
, unless they died of disease, that they were not 
killed. That much one did 
know. So Œ so we went Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 had no Œ no contact? 
A: No contact, none whatsoever, except th
at rumor had it that they did not kill 
people Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
87
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ unlike the Germans, who did kill peop
le. Then we lived Œ so  there we lived 
for a while very nicely, until the day that  the Germans marched in. When the ger Œ 
and we went to church regularly, went 
to church every Sund
ay, because you know, 
that was the 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Okay, what was your fe
eling, going to  church Œ 
A: That™s a very interesting, I Œ 

Q: Œ young Jewish girl going to  church ? 
A: Not the feeling that Œ that American
s have, not the feeling that I find among 

Jews here, which I very ofte
n find very repreh ensible.
 You went Œ I knew that it 
was not my religion. I was afraid that
 I would do things wrong. You had to 
participate, you had to know wh en to 
get up, you had to go 
Œ know how to go to  
communion, you had to  say the prayers th
e right place, you ha
d to  Œ you had to 
pretend, and you Œ and Œ and it had to be 
real. Another thing that I often Œ that I 
know was very highly emphasized to us, and 
I still feel very stro
ngly about this, is 
that we had to speak Polish correctly. We
 were not allowed Œ my  mo ther would 
have killed us if we had used a Jewish 
word, I mean that wa
s a giveaway. So you 
were sort of brainwashed to speak it, to
 speak it correctly  and speak it without an 
intonation and so on. Because those were gi
veaways. So to this
 day, when Œ when 

I hear Œ hear people mi xing, you know, Yi
ddish and English, I Œ I can™t stand it.

First of all, I don™t thin
k it™s nice, because every la
nguage should be Œ I have 
nothing against Yiddish , but by itself, 
it shouldn™t be mixed, you don™t mix 
languages. Now there it was a matter of lif
e and death, so you 
had to speak Polish 
correctly, and th at was s-something that was another reason why my  mo ther was 
very anxious to hire someb
ody to Œ to Œ to 
be with us, though
, because children 
pick up accents, and that we should speak 
properly. So , we went to church  every 
Sunday. How did I feel? I had one problem 
with it, and that was a very strange 
one. That the incense, I hated the smell of 
it, and I mu st have 
just about gotten to 
the age just before puberty, and I used 
to get terrible headaches. And Œ which I 
suffered from for a while. But I had a feeli
ng at that time that the incense ma Œ 
produced them. Any time they start Œ I al
ways had a headache 
on Sunday, whether 
it was the tension and the incense, or what
 it was Œ my mother 
went with us to 
church, so did my father. My mother knew  very well what to do, she was very Œ 

had been ex posed to  it and so on. My fath
er did Œ you know, what he was told to 
do. But that was one of the th
ings that did make us nervous. It™s not that I was Œ 
that I hated it, but it made us nervous. 
It™s like crossing the 
border, you know. If 
they discover you™re not who you say you 
are, you™re in danger, so it made me 
nervous, yes. 

Q: Did you think ab out death a lot? 

A: Yes, yes. We Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

89
Q: Was it something you were fearful of? 
A: Yes, yes, because I knew that each time,
 like when they arrested us, and they Œ 

they™ll be another episode later, which wa
s more dangerous, that each time there 
was the possibility that they would send us 
back. And if they se
nd you back, then 
that was death. 

Q: And you knew that as a child? 

A: Oh, oh 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: How did you know that? 

A: Because everybody talked 
about it, that the danger was not so much of sitting 

in this prison in 
Buda pest
, which was not Œ they didn™t
 torture you, they didn™t 
beat you, they didn™t do terrible things to 
you. The danger was th
at they will se Œ if 
they discover that you™re not who you say 
you are, they™ll send you back. If you Œ 
they send you back, you™
ll go to the border guards, the border guards will hand 
you over to the Gestapo. And th en we 
knew that that was Œ that was 95 Œ 99 
percent sure that you will be killed. 

Q: Did your mother or father try to soften
 this for you? Do yo
u know what I mean, 
to put a layer Œ to prote Œ a protective layer? 
A: No, no, because this wa
s in the air, everybody talk
ed about it; who had been 
caught, who had been  sent back, why di
d they  send th em back, why the papers 
weren™t good en ough. This wa
s Œ this was what people ta
lked about, so this was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
90
something th ey couldn™t really protect us
 from. They said that our papers were 
better, may b e, or that if we spoke correc
tly Polish that we would minimize this, 
that somebody would denounce us locally. 
You know, all these things, that™s why 
we would Œ did all these things, to preven
t this from happening.
 But nobody tried 
to tell you th at if it did happen, th at you 
would surviv e, no, th-th-that was like a 
sure death. So that was th
e scary thing out there all the time. And that™s the danger 
of living on false papers, you know. So we
 stayed there, a
nd Œ and w Œ and we 
were there until the Germans invaded. Wh
en the Germans invaded, that™s when 
things became very da
ngerous, because a Œ they came 
and they made a inspection, 
and they  did it very, very quickly. Ever
ybody had to register with them. They 
came, they set up a desk in a Œ in a ha
 Œ in a schoolhouse or in a house Œ I 
reme mb er it was in a house. And people had to line up Œ 

Q: This is at your village? 

A: Yes. People had to line up. They made
 an announcement, 
tomorrow morning or 
whatever, they are going to 
have an inspection, ev erybo
dy has to register. Was just 
a registration, really. But that was da
ngerous, because they
, of course, were 
looking for Jews, that™s what
 they were looking for. So 
th at was very bad, and at 
that point, we were doubly afraid; 
A
, that they would discover that our papers 
were not a hundred percent right, and 
B
, that somebody wo
uld denounce us, 
because before that, if somebody had de
nounced us, there was really very little

gain. What, they went to the Hungarians
, the Hungarians didn™t know who was 
who, they were not that interested in 
the whole thing. But here now, we were 
afraid of that. So the minute that happ
ened, we went through the registration 
because there was nothing we could do 
to avoid it, because it happened very 
quick ly. 
Q: Did you go down  yourself? 

A: Yes, I s Œ went with my mother, yes, 
I went with my  mo  Œ they separated men 
and women. But one Œ what 
was the wonderful thing about
 it is that my Œ my Œ 
you see, what was dangerous was for my 
father Œ it wasn™t so much for women, 
because they did examine men, they Œ and that was the easiest way to tell who was 

who. This husband of this teacher whom 
we had, he Œ his ph
ysique was somewhat 
similar to my father, he was shorter, but ot
her than that, he was sort of husky, was 
a big man also, but shorter. And an yhow, he 
went instead of my father. He went in 
the mo rning himself, he got on the end 
of th e line after a couple of hundred  
people, he went instead of Œ with my  fath
er™s papers. And my brother they didn™t 
examine, my brother went, you know, wi
th  him as his child and th ey just, you 
know. So after that Œ I™m in touch with he
r to this day, I just wrote her a letter. 
They still Œ 
Q: What are Œ what are their Œ their names? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
92
A: 
Rochinski
(ph), 
Roch inski
(ph). Her name was 
Helena Rochinska
(ph). His 
name is Œ I don™t know his first name, but 
Rochinski
(ph), you know, you didn™t 
address people by th eir first name, but I kn
ew her better than him. But I Œ we saw 
them now Œ I mean, now, in
 1973 when we were in 
Poland
, and 
Mike
 and I went 
to visit them. They live in 
Pozn an
, and to  this day I am in touch with her, I write 
to her, my father™s, you know, helped he
r after the war. I still send her money as 
well, and so on. So it is one of those wond
erful stories. And they
 are Œ so then we 
disappeared. Right after this-this thing, we
 knew we-we Œ we couldn™t stay, that 
we Œ we ran away from there. 
Q: When  you were standing on
 line with y
our mother Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ do you have any recollection? 

A: Just Œ just being scared
, and being relieved after they
, you know, they Œ th ey Œ 
you went there, they Œ they looked at 
your papers and they  waived  you on. There 
was no co nversation. The minute Œ as my
 mother used  to say, the minute a 
conversation starts, things are bad. I m
ean, you know, there was nothing to  talk 
about if they didn™t question your truthful
ness, or whatever. So, no, there was no 
conversation, looked at our 
paper and waved us on and th
at was it. Then  we went 
home. And that was another one of thos
e situations wh ere my  parents had an 

enormous fight, because my father felt 
that n o w that they have, you know, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

registered us and examined us, we could st
ay . T h en  my  mo th er 
said, we can™t stay 
here. Somebody sooner or later will either 
denounce us or something™s Œ th is is no 
place for us to stay now. And she usually 
won out, because she made such scenes, 
my  mo ther could fight, and Œ and actually
 my  parents got along. And so we left. 
We left. I mean, what we did was Œ I do
n™t remember exactly how Œ we stayed 
with a fr Œ my  brother and I stayed  w
ith a friend of my uncle™s, a Christian 
woman, a Po lish lady, in  
Buda pest
. And my  parents stayed with somebody, but I 
have no id ea with wh om. And during the ne
xt few weeks, two or three or four 
weeks, whatever that time period was, they
 made arrangements to Œ to try to cross 
the border illegally, to 
Romania
. In  other word s, we tried to do th e same thing we 
did from 
Poland
 to 
Hungary
, now from 
Hungary 
to  
Ro ma nia
. 
Ro ma nia
, things
 
were mu ch easier, as you know. Prior to th
at, I forgot to  mention my  Œ you know, 
there were transports going, prior to 
the Germans arriving, there was a way of 
going to 
Palestine
 th-t hat was Œ there was some sort
 of effort made, and my uncle 
tried to get on one of those transports, because he had been a Zionist before the 

war, which my  father was not, and he kne
w Hebrew, and he rated whatever, you 
know, an affidavit, or whatev
er they needed at the time,
 to prove that they were 
worthy of going to 
Palestine
. And he, I don™t know how he did it, but he got this 
fake Œ I showed you that pict
ure, I think Œ he got this 
fake permit for a wife and a 
child, and my mother was suppos
ed to go as his wife, and 
Stefan
, my  brother was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

94
supposed to go as their child
. But that never materialized
. That™s why there is this 
funny photo, passport photo of my  uncle,
 my  mo ther and Œ and my  brother. That 
never materialized. But then, after the 
Germans came, and we were hiding fo r a 
bit, we tried to go to 
Romania
. And the way that happened was we went to 
Szeged
, and there there was a line-up. There 
was a house owned by some people 
who rented the rooms. You paid  them. And 
that was just renti
ng rooms. But then 
there was an aristocrat or a landowner 
who was Œ whose property was right on the 
border, and th-the Œ the way was through 
his property. And he was a kind of 
bon 
vivant
 before the war, or during the beginn
ing of the war, and he had a lot of 
parties. So he wasn™t cons
picuous by having 10, 12 people 
at his estate at any one 
time. So people Œ so  the first place 
where you stayed was a Œ at Œ in 
Szeged
, and 
then you went at night to his property, a
nd then you stayed there for one day, and 
there was this pretense of a party. And 
then at night you cr
ossed the border to 
Romania
. And the party before 
us was caught. Somebody mu st have announced, 
and they  were all killed, by the way. So
 he was Œ they were caught, and somebody 
Œ and they came to get us, because somebod
y Œ they were tortured, and they gave 
out the ad dress of where people Œ they knew
 that this was like 
a chain. My uncle, 
luckily, was not home when th
ey came to arrest us. We were there, he was out on 
Œ in town, because he was sup
posed to go with us that 
evening, but he
 went out on

town. He was a Œ that was one of these st
rokes of genius. And 
he Œ and we were 
arrested, and they took us
 to the local jail in 
Szeged
. 
Q: This was the four of you? 
A: Just the four of us, right. They sepa
rated my  mo ther and me, and my  brother 
and Œ and my  father were in the men™s™ 
jail. Now there I remember it distinctly, 
because we went in the sa
me cell with two prostitutes.
 You Œ this was a local 
prison, you know, you had 
these Œ and it was a miserable little jail, and the 
conditions were terrible, and there I was 
sure that we wouldn
™t survive. I was 
terrified, because I knew that if they arrested us, and th ese people there gave our 

names, that the next thing 
would be that they Œ that 
the police, th-the Hungarian 
police would hand us over to the Gestapo,
 there was no Œ I didn™t think there was 
any other way out of this. And there my  mo ther
 used to say that I used to cry. I Œ I 
remember crying, I rememb
er thinking th at I was too young to die. And my  
mother said that I told he
r a couple of times that it™
s easier for her because she 
already had a life, and I didn™t have a
nything. And she said that was sort of 
heartbreaking. But I rememb er being terribl
y scared in that prison, terribly. Cause 
there it was the closest we came to being 
sent back. And we were there for a few 
days, and we were told by the Hungarian
 guards, and by these women with whom 
my  mo ther started being very  friendly, that
 they are Œ that the Gestapo came to the 
prison once a week. There was a day when 
they handed people over. And so the

hope was that somehow, by some miracl
e, we would get out, I don™t know if it 
was a Monday or a Tuesday, whatever, befo
re that happened. But I s Œ I didn™t see 
any way out, but it so happened  th at afte
r Œ I™ll tell you why it happened. I Œ that 
the day befo re there was Œ we were ther
e six days Œ th e day 
before they were 
supposed to come, they re leased us, and in the cust
ody of a local lawyer, a 
Hungarian lawyer wh o was born and bred in  
Szeged
. Now the way this was done 
is very interesting, it shows you how re sourceful my  uncle was. When my  uncle 
came back and realized we had been take
n Œ by the way, my  mo ther left money 
and jewelry behind one of the pictures. Th
ey  had a Œ th ey  had a Œ a secret as to 
how, you know Œ anyhow 
[indecipherable]
 he got that, and he went back to 
Budapest
, by foot, by hitchhike, I don™t even
 know how, but he did go back, 
because his papers were not so 
[indecipherable]
 either. But he was loner man, he 
was very resourceful. And 
he went to the Polish co
mmittee, there was a Polish 
committee, which was in char
ge of Polish refugees in 
Hungary
. It was like a Œ a 
committee. And hekne
w a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a 
number of non-Jews from before the war. He
 knew people in Œ and all the time, he 
was in touch with th em. And 
he told them what happen
ed to us. And basically, 
they figured out that the on
ly transgression that we did, for all practical purposes, 
was that my father was not supposed to be in 
Szeged
, because we, as Polish 
refugees were Œ we had designated area
s where we were supposed to live, and

Szeged
 was not one of them. So they invented 
this idea that he went to look for 
work . And that was a very 
nice idea, but then they looked for a connection an d 
they found the most 
prominent lawyer in 
Szeged
, paid him off. He paid off the Œ I 
mean, this Œ the Œ th e girl was his regul
ar, you know, where he Œ where he was 
well known, and wh ere he had his cronies. So
 that™s how we got 
out. So we were 
actually Œ and th is lawyer, also a wonde
rful man, took us to his house, and you 
know, really treated us Œ he was a Hung
arian Œ very well. I mean, he fed us, I 
remember we took a bath 
there, everything was Œ 
Q: What were the cond
itions like in the jail? 
A: Terrible, terrible Œ 
Q: Did you go outside? 
A: Œ it was a small cell Œ no, no. It was a cell where you sat Œ 

Q: So again you were coop
ed up, again you were  
A: Abso lutely, and it was with these two 
Œ two women who my  
mother later told 
me were prostitutes, but these were local gi
rls, and we were ju
st sitting there with 
these local women, and Œ a
nd my mother used to tell 
me  stories, because my  
brother wasn™t with us, we didn™t see th
em, th ey were Œ you know, they Œ we saw 
them maybe once, they Œ there was a pl
ace where Œ where Œ there was a corridor 
where my mother went to 
see them, I didn™t see them. 
But she used to tell me 
stories. I once made a speech for the 
Heschel
(ph) school. I said that, you know,

children™s stories usually start with once up on a time, our stories always started, 
after the war. And sh e used to invent Œ she 
was a very good story teller in general, 
and she used to invent th
ese stories about what woul
d happen after the war. But 
there I Œ it was almost more
 than a fairy tale, because there I didn™t believe we 
would get out. That was the only time I 
really didn™t think we would make it. 
Q: Did you find that your 
bond to your mo ther was getting closer and closer Œ 
A: Yes, yes Œ 
Q: Œ the mo re you ex perienced with her? 
A: Œ yes, yes, yes. I f e lt that she was th
e str o ngest Œ and I Œ my strongest bond was 
to my uncle, cause my unc
le was like God. He was the one who arranged things. 
He arranged our escape from 
Poland 
Œ 
Q: This is 
Joseph Schtiglietz
(ph)
 
Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ we™re talking about. 
A: From 
Poland
 to 
Hungary
. He arranged a Œ first Œ and he was also very 
amusing, he was a Œ he arranged th at Œ 
our release from prison. He would arrange 
things, you know, he would bring th ings fo
r us, he would tell stories, he would Œ 
he had all the adventures. I mean, in betw
een he had his own adventures. He used 
to tell stories how he outwitted different th
e Œ he Œ he Œ to me he was immortal, 
indestructible an-and he proved such, I m
ean, he was a wonderfu
l man. So he, to 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

me, was God. I wo rshipped the ground he 
walked on. And my  mo th er was the next 
best thing, because she was 
a little bit like him, but of course she was a woman, 
and she was tied to my  father and my  fath
er was ailing also, he was, you know, he 
was not the Œ he Œ he was sick. As a ma tte
r o f fact, in Œ I mean, not all the time, 
but in 
Szeged
, right after they released us, he 
had a gall bladder attack. And he Œ 
this Hungarian lawyer arranged for him to 
go to the hospital a
nd he was very, very 
sick. At that point, my  uncle made some
 sort of arrangements with somebody to  
pick us up, my  brother 
and me, and brought us to
 Budapest
, by train, I remember. 
We went to 
Budapest
 and then  he put us up with 
his friend, he had a lady friend 
while he was Œ while he was there he had lo ts of lady friends. 

Q: This is your uncle, yeah. 
A: And so we stayed with
 Œ with his friend at the 
time, was a lovely Polish 
woman, beautiful woman. And she Œ so 
she Œ we lived  with her, and th en my 
uncle came and Œ and you know
, he was there in the even
ings and all the time, but 
we basically lived with her. And my  pare
nts went to the hospital. Was a convent 
hospital, and my  father was apparently ve
ry sick, which I didn™t know any more, 
because we had left. And my mother saidthat they came ahe 
Œ and they actually 
came for Œ you know, to give
 him unction, and these were
 these priests, and my 
mo ther told him how he had to confess, he
 had to make a last confession. And of 
course, he didn™t have to do it so
 well, because it was in Hungarian 
[break]

Q: You were talking about
 your father having the gall bladder attack. 
A: Right. So  he went to the hospital. I 
understand he was ex Œ very , very sick. My 
mother claimed that after he had the last
 confession and th ey 
did do his Œ the rites 
and all of that, he started im
proving. She actually believed Œ 
Q: But he did make a confession? 
A: Yes, yes, but he co nfessed Œ he was 
very sick and he wa
s probably, you know, 
even not quite lucid. I me
an, he spoke in Polish and they  didn™t Œ th ese were 
Hungarian priests, so whatev
er he mu mb led, she sort of improvised half Polish, 
her Hungarian wasn™t so great either, wa
s not the pun Œ you 
know, our oblig ation 
to know Hungarian. So anyh
ow, she said the confession went very  well, but she 
always told it as a very am
using story, how he after th
at started improving. And he 
Œ so he was in this hospital for a few 
weeks, and she was with him. She Œ you 
know, they very often let re
latives stay in European  ho
spitals, it™s still common in 
Brazil
, even. But anyway, after that Œ and we
 were hidden Œ not
 hidden, but living 
with this woman, hidden in a way, because 
we couldn™t go out. And then later, my  
uncle placed us with the janitor of a v
illa which was owned by Jewish antique 
dealer, who had been a contact of my  unc
les before the war. It
 was now occupied 
by a Du tch Œ I don™t know, official, or 
somebody who was doing a lot of busin ess 
with the Germans. And my uncle met him 
because he knew both the janitor and 
the previo us owner. The previous owner, 
by the way, survived  in one of those 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

101
Jewish houses in Œ in 
Budapest
, he was not deported, he did surv ive. And so  my  
uncle placed us in this villa, it was in 
Buda
, right on top of a mo untain, near a 
cemetery, I remember, with 
this janitor and his wife. So we were there. My 
parents, when they returned from 
Szeged
 from the hospital, 
stayed with some 
friends or some peop
le they knew in 
Budapest
. This was already now getting 
close to the end, and confusion was ramp an
t.  This was already Œ the Russians were 
very close. 

Q: What we haven™t talked about is
 your relationship with  your brother. 
A: My brother was a nuisance, throughou
t the war. My brother was Œ I always 
thought Œ my Œ my father, yo
u see, my fath Œ my mother was his second wife, and 
he was not young. My  father was born in 
1887, so wh en my  brother was born, he 
was close to 50. So my father had very little
 Œ and he was a very autocratic kind of 
authoritarian person. He had very  little
 understanding, knowledge or anything 
about children. Children were supposed to
 be quiet and obey. 
And my  brother was 
lively, had nothing to do Œ I 
mean we Œ we had nothing to
 do, it™s very Œ now I see 
how difficult it was, but as a result of it, 
he was a terrible nuisa
nce. He Œ he Œ my  
father was constantly yelling at him, my 
uncle often used to beat him up, he was 

beaten very often. He was a terrible nui
sance, because he Œ he couldn™t just 
behave. And I, as a child, or Œ I was onl
y a year and a half older, I was very 
mature, and I was very quiet. So  I was no 
problem. My mo ther taught me how to 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
102
darn, my mother taught me 
how to knit. Later on I knew how to read, so I used to 
read Œ not appropriate things, because she 
Œ wh atever Po lish book she had, I could 
sit there an d decipher it, whether I liked
 the story or not, because that was 
something to  do. I did all kinds of word
 games and so on. My brother wasn™t 
interested in any of that, and he didn™t 
do any of that. So he really Œ I don™t 
remember what he did except make a te
rrible nuisance of himself. So Œ and I 
always, whenever they f Œ they also 
fought about him, because my  mo ther 
protected him, my  father got angry at him,
 my mo ther protected him. So he was a 
problem, and I always thought that he 
was the problem, I didn™t know, nor did I 
understand that the circumstances were th
e problem, and he was just a naturally Œ 
a normal child who was in terrible conditions. 

Q: Did you talk about the 
dangers with your brother? 
Did Œ did you confide in 
each other about your fears, and Œ 

A: No, I don™t Œ maybe I did and maybe 
I didn™t, I don™t remember. No, I don™t 
remember. I remember playing with him 
sometimes. I remember taking care of 
him sometimes when he became impossible. 
My father would say, you take care 
of him, and I tried to Œ to make him be 
quiet. I don™t know Œ we both were afraid 
at Œ as a matter of fact, I told y
ou th at I did an oral history in 
Brazil
 in Portuguese, 
and I have those tapes, but
 because of my brother, be
cause he did one over there 
and they  were Œ they had a program on Jewi
sh refugees a few years ago, and the Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
January 5, 1996 
 

 
 
103
the focus was, what do people take when
 they™re running away
, do they take their 
pictures, do they take jewelry, do they 
take medals? I me an, depending, different 
people took different things. But that was 
the focus, and with that they had a few 
oral histories. And it is amazing how 
different his perception was of what 
happened . How he was afraid Œ the basic f
acts are the same, but like he was afraid 
at different times, he remembers different 
mo ments as being the worst or the best, 
and Œ from me. And we were only a year and 
a half apart, so Œ but I do know that 
he was a problem. He was a problem becau
se he Œ he had Œ he was a problem; 
made noise, got on people™s nerves, becau
se he was bored. So I Œ you know, I 
tolerated Œ I Œ I identified with the grownup
s and the people who knew that Œ that 
you had to behave. And 
Œ and Œ and he Œ an d I saw him the same way, 
unfortunately, I™ve Œ today I™m sorry about 
it, as my father did, that he was a 

nuisance and he didn™t know how to  behave
 and he didn™t know th at he had to  be 
quiet. So , I did not iden tify with him, nor 
with his problems. I didn™t identify with 
his problems til many years la
ter, when I had my own children and I realized that 
children Œ what children really
 need and so on. Bu t during th e war he was a pain in 
the neck, he really was. And, I think we™
ll stop here, because otherw ise I™ll be very 
late.

volunteer collection interview with 
Riane Gruss
. Previously, tape number one was 
recorded on April 22
nd
, 1994 in 
Chevy Chase
, 
Mary land
. And tapes number two 
and three were recorded on January 5
th
, 1996, in 
New York City
. Today™s interview 
is conducted, as before, by 
Gail Schwartz
, o n  March 1
st
, 1999, in  
Chevy Chase
, 
Mary land
. This is tape number four, side 
A
. And just to clarify where we are, and 
your age, you are 12 years old, it is mid-1944, and you are living in 
Buda
 at the 
time. 
A: That™s correct, except that my  impression 
is that it was fall 1944, and we Œ at that 
point we were in 
Buda
; we meaning my  brother and I, 
because my  parents stayed on 
in 
Szeged
 longer because my father was sick. He was first in the hospital, then he 
stayed for as long as they could in the ho
use of the lawyer who was able to get us 
out of jail. He was a lawyer
 who was quite prominent in 
Szeged
, had a large 
apartment, because I remember
 it, because that™s where went directly from prison, 
we went to his apartment, and we stayed 
there a day or tw o before my  brother and I 
left for
 Budapest
, and he Œ and my  father went 
to Œ got sick and stayed on and 
ended up in the hospital. Now we are in 
Buda
 at the janitor of a friend of my uncle™s 
Œ oh, not a friend really, but an acquainta
nce who was in the same b u siness as my 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

105
uncle, he was a art dealer in 
Budapest
, and he had a villa in 
Buda
 where he lived, 
and on th e property he had a caretaker a
nd his wife. It was a small house on the 
property, separate. And that™s where my unc
le placed us. And that™s where we were 
living, and it wasn™t bad there, it was fine. 
I mean, they fed us 
and they were quite 
nice to us, we were not supposed to be r
unning around too mu ch , although we could 
go into the garden, but we 
were not going out too mu ch. And my  uncle would come 
and visit us quite often. Even tu
ally, my parents came back to 
Budapest
, and we did 
not see them, at least I don™t remember
 seeing them. And I think they stayed 
somewhere, with someone for a very short time, because then my father got sick 
again. And he went to  the hospital, and 
from what I understand,
 he was operated Œ 
he had gall bladder problems, that Œ that
 was his u Œ these various stays in the 
hospital ha Œ were gall bladder attacks. An
d I think he was oper 
Œ not only I think, I 
know, he was operated by a surg eon as th
 Œ people called them then a professor 
something, pr Œ I don™t reme mb er his name. 
And the surgeon realized that they were 
Œ who th ey were, or wh at they were and he
 decided to help them, I presume. And he 
kept my father in the hospital beyond
 Œ beyond what was 
necessary. Today you 
can™t do that, but then you di
d. And he was a prominent Œ 
he was prominent in this 
hospital, and my  parents had a private room
, and my mother stayed with him, which 
was very co mmon in those days. And he Œ they
 were liberated in the hospital. So for 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
106
them this was a marvelous thing, because he
 just kept him on and on. And he wasn™t 
terribly well, he was weak, he was after surg
ery, so there was some justification in 
that. But anyhow, that™s wh
ere they were liberated. We, on th e other side Œ on th e 
other hand were in 
Buda
 in Œ with  this janitor, and my  uncle was the one who kept 
coming to us and visiting us. 
And Œ and yo Œ sort of looking after us. And wh ile this 
was going on, of course the 
front was getting closer and closer, the Russians were 
coming closer and closer, and 
Budapest
 was encircled. So the siege of 
Budapest
 
was about, I think, five or 
six weeks, it was quite long.  
Q: Before we get to that, which is impor
tant, you were a 12 year old child at the 
time. You are separated from your parents.Do you remember this as being a very 
frightening time? Did you have nightmares, 
did you know what was going on? Were 
you really, truly aware of what was happening? 
A: Twelve years in those days was not rea
lly a child. I was very
 aware of what was 
going on, I was very Œ was I frightened? I wa
s afraid Œ not Œ I was afraid because 
also the gun Œ you heard Œ by th en you we
re beginning to  hear a lot of guns and 
shooting, and th ere were bombings, the Russians were flying over 
Buda pest
 with 
their planes, and so on. Was I afraid? Yes,
 I was afraid all the time. My one vivid 
memory from that time is that
 that™s when I first got my period. And I didn™t know 
who to tu rn to. I didn™t have
 any kind of protection, and 
it was horrible. And it Œ that 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
107
Œ that I remember very clearly. And then I to
ld Œ I guess I told my
 uncle, and he said 
it was normal, and he spoke to this woman 
there and she gave me some rags, which 
I had to wash out, but th ey 
were very hard to keep be
tween my  legs, because they 
kept falling out. And that™s my one vivi
d memory from that period. But was I 
afraid? Yes, I Œ but Œ but as I said, you we
re afraid most of the time. I was less 
afraid then that we woul
d be caught or Œ or some
thing horrible wo uld happen , 
because things were very stable in a way,
 we Œ you know, there was this couple and 
they took care of us, and they were nice to
 us, and there was, I guess, enough food. 
It wasn™t we Œ i-it was okay, it was Œ it was one
 of the sort of stable sort of moments. 
We were not running away, we
 were not Œ it wasn™t Œ we were maybe a little lonely, 
but I don™t remember that so
 distinctly. I rememb er being very  excited every time 
my  uncle came and Œ to see us. And Œ 
Q: What was your relationship 
with your brother at that 
point, who was a year and a 
half younger? 
A: Right. I don™t rememb er him being par
ticularly difficult at that point. It was 
probably very good at that point. We were
 just on our own, and he didn™t Œ I don™t 
reme mb er him as Œ in any way at that point. 
All I remember is that
 I was always told 
that I was the older one, I was the more ma
tu re one, and I was sort of looking after 
him a little, but he Œ I don™t re
member him being any problem. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
108
Q: Did you think ab out your parents a 
lot while you were separated from them? 
A: Yes, but I was mu ch mo re dependent on 
my uncle, I must say. I Œ I Œ I felt that Œ 
that he was the one who was instrumental in 
either us surviving or
 not surviving. He 
Œ my  father, you have to know, was helpless,
 was sick, a nd Œ at the time, so while I 
Œ I thought about them, I don™t rememb er 
Œ I knew they were in the hospital, my 

uncle told me that they were safe, that th
ey Œ this professor was going to  keep  them 
there. And so no, the answer
 is, I wasn™t agonizing over
 what™s happening to them, 
no. I was mo re agonizing ab out my  uncle coming and making sure that we all were 

right, because I knew that he Œ it was all dependent on him, it was his relationship 

with these people, it was him taking care of 
us, and he was mu ch mo re resourceful at 
ma Œ than my parents were at the time,
 and he was alone, and he was vital and 
interesting, and he was a great person. 

Q: What Œ what kind of re
lationship did you ha
ve with  the couple who was taking 
care of you? Were they Œ was it a warm relationship? 
A: No. No, it was not a warm 
relationship. I just remember
 them as being civil and 
nice to us, but it was not a warm, warm rela
tionship, at least not Œ not that I am 
aware of, no. 

Q: Were there any other children in the house? 
A: No, th ey were a childless couple. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
109
Q: And did you have any sc
hooling during that time? 
A: No. No, no schooling whatsoev
er, zero. Because at that point, this Œ mu ch before 
that, when we were living in the settlement 
with all the Polish refugees at that point, 
M-Mrs. 
Rochinska
(ph) was teaching us, but th is was 
Œ by then we had lost contact 
with her, and sh e probably remained, she 
was really critch Œ Ch ristian. And we 
started running a Œ from one place toanother. No, no schooling whatsoever. 

Q: Did you feel at that point Viennese, 
or Polish? What Œ wh
at did you think you 
were as a 12 year old? 

A: Nothing. No, we Œ it Œ I Œ I Œ no, I di
dn™t feel like Œ I don™t think I felt like 
anything in particular, certainly not Hung
arian, certainly not Austrian. If anything, 
all through my life, I id
entify much more with 
Poland
 th an with any of the other 
countries, because I know 
even now, when I pick 
up a newspaper and there™s 
something about 
Poland
, I™ll read it, if it™s something about 
Austria
, I don™t, and 
something about 
Hungary
, also much less. So no, defin
itely Po lish, if anything, yes, 
Polish. 

Q: So what did you and your brother do during th e day?  

A: That™s a very good question,
 because I have no recollection wh at we did. I really 
don™t know, I think we probably  did noth
ing. I don™t know. I don Œ I don™t know 
what we did. I don™t know if we played, 
or talked, or Œ or Œ I Œ I don™t have any

recol Œ I think maybe she gave us some littl e things to do, like little chores and Œ I 
don™t even  reme mb er her name. 
But I don™t remember doing it. 

Q: Did you have any contact with other 
children at all during tho-those months? 
A: None wh atsoever, none. Ab solutely none
, because the idea was that we shouldn™t 
be seen too much, we Œ you 
know, nobody was exactly ve
ry proud of having these 
two children suddenly there that she never 
had before. So we were definitely not Œ 

no, no contact with other children, I don™t 
remember an y contact with other children. 
Q: Was it easy for you to sleep, or did you
 have frighten ing nightmares at that time? 
A: No, I always slept fine, and I don™t re
memb er any frightening 
nightmares, no,no, 
none Œ none whatsoever. Actually, what I do 
remember is that we
 slept Œ they had a 
big bed, and we slept with 
them in that huge bed. 
Q: The four of you? 

A: Yeah, all four of us, yeah. 

Q: What was that like? 
A: Not pleasant. No, I didn™t
 like that, no, no. Mm-mm.  
Q: Did th ey do that for purposes of 
safety, or just because of room? 
A: I think lack of room, lack of room. It was a tiny little house, and it was not Œ I 

think it was for lack of room, yeah, but
 there was absolutely no Œ no privacy.

Everybody was always touching everybody, 
I didn™t like that. Yeah, I didn™t like 
that. 
Q: But wa-was there any uncomf
ortable advances by the man? 
A: Yes. And I rememb er that, and that wa
s very unpleasant and th en I told my  
brother to sleep next to me, and then there was this mi shmash about who was 

sleeping where, and of course she wasn™t 
aware of it, and so sh e Œ you know, it Œ it 
stopped, it wasn™t very long. It 
just happened once or twice, yeah. 
Q: But did you say an
ything to  the man? 
A: No. No, I was much too afraid, no. 

Q: Okay , and th en the next Œ 
A: Then, the most dramatic 
event I remember was that my
 uncle told me that he 
would co me and stay with us. We realized
 that we were being Œ that we were 
encircled, and that eventua
lly there will be a fight, and there™ll be a siege. And my 
uncle said that when things get really ba
d, and the fighting beco mes very, you know, 
dangerous, he would come and stay with 
us. He wasn™t going to  leave us there by 
ourselves. And that was my  biggest concern, 
that Œ that the fighting would start, and 
Œ and we would be all alone. And that I wa
s really afraid of. So, I don™t rememb er 
how it was, but I do remember th at I used 
to meet my  uncle Œ there was also another 
danger, that if somebody Œ something su sp
icious happen s, like somebody came to Œ

to ask questions, or to ask why we were th
ere, or who were we, 
or any kind of police 
visit or inquiry, I was supposed  to wa
rn my  uncle, because 
h e was mu ch  mo re 
vulnerable be Œ not mu ch mo re vulnerable, bu
t really vulnerable. In other words, if 
they were suspicious of us, he didn™t want
 to come there, because they would arrest 
him. They would certainly watch him. So Œ 
Q: How Œ how woul
d you warn him?  
A: Well, that was Œ I knew exactly  wh ere he was st Œ coming, I knew the route he 
was taking, and there wa Œ th
ere was that streetcar, and he had to get off on the last 
stop of th e streetcar and it was near a ce
metery, and I knew, yo
u know, I knew the 
neighborhood a little, so I knew
 how Œ and each time, I wo
uld meet him there when 
he came. He would tell me when he is coming and I would wait for him there, 
sometimes for very long peri
ods of time . And when they 
were already really close 
and were shooting and so on, the last time, be
fore he s Œ before he actually remained 
with us, I went to meet him and he always
 talked about that. 
They were actually 
shooting and I was hiding behind Œ alongsid
e the graves, because the route took me 
through the Œ through th e cemetery. And 
I got to the end station where I was 
supposed to wait for him, but the Œ the 
trams weren™t coming very regularly any 
more, so I waited there for a ve
ry long time, he had to walk part of the way. But he 
came, and he was always very impressed that 
I made it to meet him, that I was Œ that 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
113
I was courageous enough to  do it. He said
 no one else, when they  were shooting, 
would have done it, but I wa
s always very reliable and de
pendable, and at that point 
I certainly was even more so
, I imagine. That was what 
I was Œ wanted to do, and 
that™s what I Œ was expected of me, so 
I did it. Anyway , he came, and then we 
together ran back , you know, hiding and 
falling to the ground. It was the real 
shooting by then. And th en he 
stayed with us. And the Œ 
Q: But what part of 
Buda
 were Œ were you staying 
in? Can you be a little more 
specific about area? 

A: I cannot. As a matter of fact, we 
went back, my  husband and I went to 
Budapest
 
in about 1982 or so, and I tried to ra Œ 
locate the Œ the street, and I couldn™t. I 
couldn™t. I know it was a Œ a par Œ a residential part of 
Buda
, quite Œ because 
Buda
, 
th-the Œ the lower part of 
Buda
 is part of the city, so th
at™s very much like a city, 
like 
Pest
, only that it™s the nicer part, it™s the 
older part of the city. But where we 
were was a residential part and was a si 
Œ and it was on top of a hill. I remember 
that, and then there was this Œ and it was th
e last stop of the trolley car. I couldn™t 
remember where it Œ I mean, I Œ we went th
ere and we walked around and there was 
a hill. But what looked to me at that 
time as a big hill was probably a minute hill. 
And so we tried to find it, no, we c
ouldn™t. So  I don™t know wh at part of 
Budapest
.

Q: Was it hard for your brother wh en yo
u would go to  meet your uncle, and you 
would leave him alone in the house? Do you think that was hard for him? 
A: Never asked him, there was no choice. He
 just staye d  there, 
and that was it. My 
uncle said that I have to go by myself. I 
Œ was always safer for girls than for boys. 
Q: Why is that? 

A: Because of the circumcision. If you were caught, for a girl it was much easier 

than for a boy. So he had to
 stay home and that Œ and also you Œ you know, I didn™t 
want to bother with him; 
he was younger, he was Œ anyhow, it was my  job an-and I 
never thought much about what he felt when
 he stayed behind. Then we went Œ so 
anyway, then we came back, and by that tim
e we no longer stayed
 in the Œ in the 
caretaker™s house, because by that time th
e Germans were really on the run, and 
there was less danger of being arrested or something by the Germans. They  were not 

so much on the run as they 
were occupied by other thin
gs. They were fighting. And 
we moved into the main house, and my un
cle was able to get the old couple, who 
were actually the antique dealer and his wife
, they were in a Œ what they called it Œ 
they were hidden someplace in 
Buda
 Œ in Œ in 
Pest
, I think. I don™t know exactly, 
but my uncle was able to get them out to 
wherever they were, a
nd helped them come 
to our Œ come to their Œ 
what was their home, what was their house, and they 
prepared the cellar. And we were all in th
e cellar of the villa, because that was safer. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
115
It was a real cellar, so it was more like 
a shelter. And that™s where we were. So it 
was the old couple, my uncle and the two 
of us, and the caretaker and his wife 
would co me in there and stay fo r a while and 
then go back to thei
r house. They were 
in and out, I remember. Th
ere was a Dutch man Œ by th e way, that™s how we were 
actually able to stay with the caretaker. Th
ere was a Dutch man, I think Œ well, this 
will make a lot of sense, I think it was 
Menton
(ph). 
Menton
(ph) is a very well-
known name because there wa
s a book written about him, and then my uncle, after 
the war, was in a very controversial situation with him. 
Menton
(ph) lived, or his 
friend, lived in the villa, and 
that™s how we were able to 
stay with the caretaker, and 
there was no suspic Œ I mean, nobody looked
 at who we were and what we were. 
And so Œ but by then, 
Menton
(ph) had fled, because he 
was obviously friendly with 
the Germans, and he was afraid and I think if he went to  
Holland
 Œ he Œ he was 

gone and the villa was empty. So the rightfu
l owners came back, they were very old. 
As a matter of fact, she died
 during the siege. And Œ and 
then Œ and we all stayed in 
the shelter of that Œ or in
 the Œ what was the shelter, but what was n-not really a 
shelter, it w as just the cellar of the villa
. And during the fight
 Œ by then it was 
winter, because we were liberated in  January. So it was freezing cold Œ 
Q: Did you continue to menstruate onc
e you started, under all that stress? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
116
A: I don™t think I menstruated because I 
don™t remember it after that, I remember 
that Œ but I think that™s very common when
 you first begin, you have a period and 
then for several months you don™t. I do
n™t remember any periods after that. 
Q: When  you had your firs
t one, did you know what 
it was? Had you had any Œ 
A: Maybe Œ maybe that was not my first one, because I now remember Œ no, 
actually I made a mistake, it was not my fi
rst one. I did get it then, and what I told 
you about the rags, I remember, an d it was te
rrible. But I don™t think it was my first 
one, I think it was my second one, because 
I did know what it was, and I remember 
the first one I got, I think when we were in 
Leányfalu
, where Mrs. 
Rochin ska
(ph) 
was teaching us and there was a relative pe
riod of quiet, and I was 11, and that™s 
when I got my first period, and I remember
 I had no clue what it was, and I thought 
that I had gotten Œ what is it called ? 
Not diphtheria, that is Œ a disease Œ 
Q: Typhoid? 

A: I think it™s typhoid where you bleed fro
m the rectum. So I thought I was deadly 
ill, and when I saw the blood on the paper a
nd I told my mother 
and that™s when she 
told me what it was. So this mu st have 
been my  second period. And then ag ain, I 
don™t remember having a period til late Œ mu
ch later. No, I did not have any. So we 
stayed, all of us in that cellar, and I do
n™t remember what we ate, but I remember 
there wasn™t terribly much. Mostly I thin
k potatoes, from what I remember, an d I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

117
don™t remember how it was prepared, I don™t Œ there was a little stove, little 
primos
(ph) what was called a little, I guess a l
ittle with kerosene or something, a 
little stove, and I think we ha
d mostly potatoes. And Œ 
Q: Did you have anything special with you 
that gave you comfort? A special book, 
or some special object? 

A: That™s a good question. I had a watch that my  uncle gave me, that 
Brenda
 has 

today, that my  uncle gave me for my , I guess 11
th
 or 12
th
 birthday, I don™t rememb er 
which one, but it was during 
the war. Must have been 11
th
. And I absolutely loved 
that watch. That watch was my prime po
ssession, it was sign of maturity, it was 

everything, a symbol of everything. And I al
ways wo re it, of course, and that watch 
I liked a lot. And th
en when  the Ru ssians did occupy 
us Œ I™ll go back to that, but 
one of the things that I reme mb er vividly 
is that my  uncle realized Œ I didn™t know 
about it, but he knew that they were rapi
ng wo men, and they were actually no Œ not 
a very kind liberators, but Œ and it was rou
gh, and he wanted to protect me , so he 
told me that Œ they also 
used to be crazy about watc
hes, they took watches by the 
dozen  and they would line them up on thei
r arms, and Œ from the wrist up, and they 
Œ that was sort of like their status symbol 
as Œ as to how many th
ey could get. It was 
really weird that Œ how they fo cused on th
e watches. So my  uncle told me that, you 
know, if I wanted to protect my watch and 
not have them take it,
 and I™ll Œ he knew I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

118
loved that watch, then I would have to hi
de under the bed. And th at™s what I did. 
And that I rememb er distinctly, that every time we heard steps on top, I would run 
and hide under the bed with
 my watch on my wrist. 
Q: Did you know what rape mean
t? Did he explain it to you?  
A: No, he didn™t tell me, he just told me that
 I had to protect my  watch, if I wanted Œ 
so that™s Œ he Œ I had no clue as to why 
he was so concerned, but I Œ but I believed 
him, you know, that that was the thing, th
ey were robbing and that™s what was the 
thing. The other thing I reme
mber distinctly is that th
e Œ they Œ the Russians je Œ 
since it was a fighting situation, 
there was a fight going on, he Œ 
[pho ne ring ing ]
 Œ 
so they would Œ th-the Russi
ans, because it wou Œ they we
re fighting, I guess, to 
make sure that they survive,
 they  would Œ wou Œ throw grenades into  cellars before 
they came in, because that wa
y they would be sure that
 it wasn™t some Germans, 
who would shoot at them when they  star
ted coming down. So the big danger was 
that they would do that. So
 every time we heard steps on 
top, I went under the bed 
with my  watch and Œ bed, it was a kind of 
cot, and my  uncle would run up the steps 
and scream in Russian, you know, the Œ we 
Œ there are just children here, and we are 
friends and so on. Don™t Œ don™t kill, don™t 
shoot, don™t Œ and he
 wo uld make a Œ he 
would talk to them and Œ and they never di
d, obviously, otherwis
e we wouldn™t have 
survived . And he would Œ and th en, you 
know, they would go 
aw ay, they would Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
119
no, I don™t remember them ev
er Œ they would come down and look around and see 
that ever Œ you know, that there are no Œ 
that no Germans are hi
ding, and they  would 
just go away  and that was the end. But this happened a co uple of times, about I 
would say th ree or four times it happened.
 And then, as they 
occupied mo re and 
mo re of the city, and we also knew already that 
Pest
 had fallen, 
Pest
 Œ they Œ the 
Germans did not defend 
Pest
 like 
Buda
. They  gave that up and th ey went in Œ they Œ 
because 
Buda
 had a hill and a castle, they occupi
ed that, and from there they were 
defending themselves. From the ca
stle, so they Œ 
they were in 
Buda
 much longer. 
And Œ 
Q: At that point, or up to that point, di
d your uncle tell you wh
at was happening in 
the other countries in 
Europe
? Were you aware of what 
was happening outside your 
immediate life?  

A: I don™t remember. I Œ all I remember 
being concerned about
, and Œ and knowing 
was how the front was progressing. In othe
r words, both the Œ 
the Œ you know, the 
invasion in Œ in 
No rma ndy
, I knew  that the Americans had invaded 
Europe
 on the 
other side, and the Russians
 were coming on this side 
and even tually they would 
liberate us. I knew the Germans were losing 
the war. I knew that
, but what exactly 
was happening in other countries? No, Idon™t Œ I don™t think I was too concerned 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
120
about that. I think we were 
really focused on ourselves, 
totally and completely. We 
couldn™t really care what happened an
ywhere else, it was Œ and at least Œ 
Q: Had you heard about, in 1943, th e 
Warsaw 
ghetto uprising? 
A: No, didn™t know anything about the 
Warsa w
 ghetto, didn™t know anything about 
Œ I knew that they were deporting people to camps. I don™t think that I knew too 
much Œ I knew that it was bad. I knew that
 Œ that they were killing people, I knew 
that Œ but the exact Œ I think I knew that th
ey have gas chambers. 
I k n ew that Œ that 
being deported was the end. That I kne
w. But I didn™t know ex actly about the 

uprising and so on. Don™t forget that the 
uprising was probably not described in  the 

press, and we didn™t have foreign fr Œ fo reign press, and I don™t even rememb er 
seeing Œ I could read, and I could read H
ungarian as well. So I remember he Œ 
reading head lines in the Hungarian  news
paper, because she bought the newspaper, 
the woman where we were hiding. But I do
n™t rec Œ they certainly wouldn™t write 
about that, so Œ I just know 
that we were Œ knew the Œ how the Œ th e Russian forces 
were advancing, and that was our prime 
concern, you know, ho
w quickly will this 
be over. And so after we were occupied an
d were safe, basically for Œ safe in the 
sense that Œ that no Germans would come 
and get us, for a few days, and mo re and 
mo re of the area was liberated, we heard that mo st of 
Buda
 was liberated, and the 
conditions in the cellar deteriorated. I mean
, she died. She was buried in Œ in Œ the 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

121
owner™s wife, the old lady, and I rememb er
 we buried her in the gard en in th e 
middle of the night. And th at was before 
we were liberated. And I also remember 
that the ground was terribly, terribly hard
, because it was winter, it was all frozen. 
Q: Was this your first c ontact with a dead body? 
A: Yes. I never knew any other dead bo
dy, but she was very old, and I don™t 
reme mb er being very  upset. I was only ve
ry upset about havi
ng to bury her and 
doing th is whole thing, because that was sc
arier, to go up and Œ an d Œ and be outside 
of the cellar and Œ and Œ and bury her 
and get Œ get her out of the cellar.  
Q: So you helped to  
actually dig the hole? 
A: Yeah, I did help. I did help dig the ho
le. And so at Œ and also, food was getting 
shorter, and it was cold. I mean, th e conditio
ns were very, very horrible. So my 
uncle decided, when  he heard that mo re and mo re of 
Buda
 was liberated and 
Pest 
was already occupied by the Russians, and 
we knew also, because we heard that the 

bur Œ brid ges had all been exploded, because
 the Germans, when they retreated to Œ 
to 
Buda
, they Œ they  explo Œ

A: So we Œ we knew some peopl
e who were living close to the 
Da nube
, and so my  
uncle decided to leave our cellar and to  try 
to get over to these ot
her people™s house, 
and see what™s happening to th em, and also try to get closer to the 
Danube
 to cross 
the 
Danube
, and Œ and meet my  parents, and get 
us across to my parents. And that™s 
what we did, and that™s what I remember
 as the mo st vivid and horrible thing, 
because th-there was snow 
on the ground, and there we
re dead bodies all over, beca 
Œ and dead  horses. And dead  horses had thes
e wide open  eyes, and so we had to s Œ 
literally step over these dead
 bodies; dead Germans, dead
 Russians and dead horses. 
And we finally got to th eir house Œ 
Q: Can you talk a little bit mo
re Œ what that™s like for a 12 year old to experience 
that? 

A: I Œ it™s hard for me t-to talk in grea
ter detail except that I was Œ it was Œ it was 
frightening, it was like a nightmare. And we ha
d to Œ it was physically also difficult, 
you had to get over these thi
ngs and it was slippery  and 
we didn™t have the best 
shoes and it was cold. It was all th ose thin
gs, and I rememb er that as being one of 
the mo st horrible walks, so to speak, that
 I ever took. But anyw
ay , we Œ and that Œ 
Q: Did Œ did your uncle comfort you at 
all, or did you ask him questions? 
A: No, there was nothing to ask. I mean, 
I knew it was the aftermath of a battle, and 
did he comfort us? No, because he was 
equally as upset as Œ you know, it was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
123
equally ha Œ people in tho Œ 
at least my  Œ my  experience
 was that except for my 
mother occasionally, when
 they were Œ when we were in jail, and things were sort of 
static, this was not static
, you had to move. It™s like 
Œ it™s like comforting a child 
who got up on top of a hill and doesn™t know
 how to ski down. 
So you comforted, 
you Œ you Œ you Œ but you ha
ve to get down. So that™s Œ that™s more or less 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t think it™s a good analogy,
 but there wasn™t time to talk. 
There was Œ you had to move, you had to Œ 
you had to  walk, and it was at night, and 
it was dark, and it was hard. Bu t he Œ I guess 
he pushed  us. He Œ I don™t know what 
he did, I don™t rememb er, but all I rememb
er is that that was a very difficult, 
miserable walk. And th en we 
got to their house, and they
 had been liberated for a 
few days also, and they were still in the 
cellar, because most people s Œ remained 
there. There was no pl Œ mu  Œ many of the 
houses on top were destroyed. Or it was 
freezing cold, it was warmer in the cellar. So
 they were down be
low, and there was 
hardly  any room for us, but somehow we Œ of
 course, we had to stay there, so we 
stayed there. But the wors
t thing was that during the night, the Germans broke out 
from the castle, and it was Œ that was the last
 Œ they were encirc
led and that was the 
last time th ey broke out and that they made
 any stand, and th at they re-occupied  our 
house. And that was terrible. And they took
 out all the men in our cellar and they Œ 
at Œ these were people that my  uncle kne
w and I don™t remember
 who they were. All 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
124
I remember is that they we
nt Œ they made all the men 
go upstairs and they killed 
three of them while we were there. Now, 
how my uncle escaped being killed, I don™t 
remember. I don™t think he went up with th
em. They said, all the inhabitants in this 
house have to come upstairs Œ all the men. And so they did, 
and they killed them. 
This was in the last minute, we were only 
occupied fo r another few hours. And th en 
the Russians advanced , and the Germans Œ 
you know, it was like a last desperate 
attempt on their part, and it was horrible 
that we ha Œ we were there. And Œ 
Q: Did you hear the shots? 
A: Yes, oh yes, I heard the shots, and th en
 I heard, you know, the despair of th-the 
wives, and you know. 
And my  uncle, I don™t reme mb er ho
w he Œ wh ether he hid, or 
whether he didn™t go up. I re
member only that three of them were killed, and he was 
very upset by that, because it was in th
e last minute, you know, it was such a 
horrible thing th at you had to Œ that Œ that 
that™s what happened at the end. And then 
we were re-occupied by the Ru
ssians, and we didn™t stay after that, we just went as 
far as the 
Danube
. We tried to cross over and my 
uncle Œ by then  I rememb er he 
sort of used us, my  brother and me, you kno
w. Here we were these children, and the 
parents were on the other side and so on. So
 because there was a har Œ a priority for 
people crossing, there was a pontoon bridge
 by then. And they didn™t want civilians 

crossing back and forth, I m
ean, this was still wartime. 
S o  he, you know, by saying 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
125
these are the paren Œ the parents are over there and these are the children and so  on, 
they let us Œ he convinced them. And what
 we had to  do was go from boat to boat, 
because this was a pontoon bridge, and they
 needed people to get the water out of 
these little boats, because thes
e boats kept leaking, and they were filling up with 
water. So it took us hours and hours, b
ecause we were going from one boat to the 
next, slowly  crossing th at bridge and he
lping get the water out of the boats. And 
then the next dramatic th
ing was that we go to 
Buda
 and we went straight to the 
hospital, and they had on th e gate, they ha
d a list of people w
ho had survived , and 
my parents were not on it. And then I re
memb er we got a terrible shock and started 
screaming and yelling. And it turned out th
at the reason there Œ 
they  had surv ived , 
the reason the list Œ they were not on that 
list was because the list w as of people who 
were still there, who had surv
ived were Œ and were in th
e hospital. And my parents, 
because they were there onl
y mainly because of being 
hidden there, the minute the 
Russians occupied 
Pest
, they left and went to some
 friends™ house. We knew where 
to look for them, and 
we came there and Œ 
Q: Let™s go back to the experience on Œ 
on the little boats and 
the pontoon bridge. 
Where did you have the ener
gy to  do what you were re
quired to do? You said 
emptying out the buckets of water and so 
fo rth. Wh ere did you get the strength? You 

were 12 years old.

A: I guess I did as mu ch as I could. I don™
t know how much stre
ngth I had. Maybe Œ 
maybe it wasn™t, you know, as Œ as efficient 
as it was supposed  to be, but that™s what 
we were told to do, and there were thes
e containers and we took th e water. Maybe 
the containers were not that big, maybe th
ey had small and bigger
 containers. I don™t 
remember that, but I do remember doing it, ye
s. It was h ard. It was hard. Everything 
that Œ those last few days were very, very
 hard . Was hard . And th en the emotio Œ by 
then the Œ I also re
member the emotional stress, because by then we knew we are 
going over, and we are going to  now be reunite
d with my parents, and while I wasn™t 
thinking about them maybe continuously all the time, this was a very exciting 

moment for us, and I remembered that. And 
I do remember when we didn™t see their 
names on that list; it was horrifying, and we
 were crying and we
 were screaming and 
I Œ my uncle said, you know, let Œ you know
, don™t cry, and ev er
ything will Œ will be 
all right, and let me ask and see what happened, and so  on, so fo rth. So then  we went 

inside and we spoke to Œ it was run by nuns and we spoke to Œ to  whoever was in the 
office there, and they told us
 where my  parents went, that they had left the hospital. 
Q: Did you have enough fo
od up to that point? 
A: No, we did not have. During the whole 
siege, I told you was th Œ we had great 
shortages, I mean, I don™t even rememb er what we ate, but I rememb er that we Œ 

there was very little to eat.

Q: Were you wearing the same clo thes all the time? 
A: Yes, yes. And I don™t remember ever ta
king a bath or Œ oh, 
I do remember that 
we were full of lice, an d that we were Œ th
at Œ that kept us, by the way, quite busy, 
because we used to sit there and take our 
clothes off and kill the lice, one by one Œ 
Q: How did you kill them? 

A: Œ betw een the nails of the two thumbs. 
That was a great occupation, you did it for 
hours and hours. And th e problem is that 
you could never kill the eggs, and th e eggs 
then would develop, and there wo uld be ne
w lice. But the lice were horrible because 
they were biting, and it was itching and it 
was horrible, yeah. So we were full of 
lice, full of lice. So when 
we got to there, where they
 were, everybody was in bad 
shape, because there was no food, there were
 terrible shortages, people were sick, 
full of lice. And that™s when we left, we le
ft right after that, bec Œ we went to the 
south of 
Hungary
, to a place called 
Ma kó
, I think. 
Q: Le-Le-Let™s talk about seeing your parents. 
A: Oh, that was very exciting, that was ve
ry exciting. We came
 there, my mother 
hugged us and kissed us a
nd cried, and there was a lot of commo tion. And it was 
quite a Œ quite a reunion. That was ve
ry, very exciting. Very exciting. 
Q: What kind of conditi
on were they both in? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
128
A: Not as bad as we, because they had been  liberated for at least two or Œ two weeks 
already, and not that there was any abunda
nce, because as I said, the c Œ the Œ the 
conditions were very hard. But I don™t thi
nk they was in as bad a condition as we 
were, because they Œ even th
e hospital, th-there was mo re
 hygiene and more food. I 
don™t think they had plenty, bu
t there wa Œ I mean, they to ok care of the sick people, 
they gave them a soup every day. No one 
was taking care of us. So I reme mb er that 

they were Œ and sh Œ my  mo th
er talked about it later, that
 they were appalled at, you 
know, very upset by the way we both look
ed, and how Œ in wh at
 terrible shape we 
were in. 

Q: How do you think you lo oked ? 
A: Probably awful. And I re
member they Œ they
 Œ the first thing they did also, we 
had a lot of lice in our hair, and they cut 
off all my  hair and 
they washed it with 
some sort of kerosene and it smelled and 
burned and so on. So I remember that. 
How did I look? Probably dirty, and ragge
d, and I don™t Œ I don™t have a clear 
picture of what we looked like, but pr
obably awful. I don™t rememb er that. 
Q: Did your mo ther or father say anyt
hing special to you, do you rememb er any 
particular word s? 

A: No. No, I don™t remember. A
ll I remember is that they ke
pt saying we have to get 
out of here as fast as possible, because th
ey Œ there was sickness, there was Œ we Œ I-

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
129
I just remember primary co
ncern about surviving this
 next danger, which was 
sickness, and Œ and you know, when ther
e™s no food, an-and hygiene conditions are 
so terrible, and there™s a lot of illness ar
ound, it spreads. And so all I remember is 
them saying that we have to get out of ther
e as quickly as possible, and that™s what 
we did. 
Q: Did you feel free? Di
d you feel a relief? 
A: Ye-Yes, in that respect we did. I me
an, we knew that the Germans were gone, 
that nobody was going to de
port us. But don™t forget th
at the Russians and the chaos 
that was right after liberation. It was not
 paradise. It was far from it. You didn™t 
know wh ether the Ru ssians wouldn™t grab 
you. Russians also did things that Œ 
unexpected things. They either arrested you,
 or they decided you 
were a capitalist. I 
mean, we had experience with the Russians,
 we had been with them. So we knew 
what they were like. So it 
wasn™t like it was paradise, plus the physical conditions, 
which were so bad. And the cold , it was the middle of winter, was January . So  it 
wasn™t like you know, now you™re
 free, and you begin to live.
 As a matter of fact, to 
digress a little, I understand there™s a new documentary called 
ﬁThe Last Days,ﬂ
 
which I understand deals a lot with the afte
rmath, what happens right after. Because 
it wasn™t that simple, it di
dn™t just end and th en everything was fine. There were 
decisions to be made, where to go, what to 
do. I also remember th
at when you Œ that 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
130
I felt that when you only surv
ive Œ when your goal is to su
rvive, you have more of a 
direction than after the war, 
when you Œ wh en it™s no long
er just to survive, but 
where to go, how to survive, 
what to do with your life. 
Wh en you™re only trying to 
save your life, your Œ yourway of thinking is very, ve
ry  different. So I almo st 
remember a certain, like a lack of dire
ction, like a certain, you know, let down 
almost. It™s like Œ it™s like after a party.
 You look forw ard to
 it like I don™t know 
what, and then afterwards you sort of, wh
ere do you go from here
? That™s the kind 
of thing I remember. And also the discussi
ons; where to go, what
 to do. So finally 
they decided to go to th e south of 
Hungary
. And for me, at that point also was a 
very big disappointment, be
cause my  uncle, whom I worshipped, decided that he 
was done with us. He Œ he knew his fa
mily had surviv ed. They  had gone from 
Siberia
 to 
Palestine
. He had Œ he had a goal, he was going to 
Palestine
 to be 
reunited with his family. So he, at that poi
nt, decided to  leave us. And he was going 
to go to 
Romania
, and from 
Romania
 I think there were boats already going to 
Palestine
 somehow. And I wanted to go with him.
 I didn™t Œ I really wanted to go 
with him. I would have gone with him to 
the end of the world. 
And that I remember 
as being very traumatic, and he talked to 
me and told  me that I couldn™t go with him 
because I wasn™t his child, and he had his ow
n children and all of that was very hard 
for me to take. And also, I felt that he 
had more direction, 
he knew what he was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
131
going to  do, while my  father did not. And 
so of course, he left and I felt very 
abandoned, very aban doned.
 And not only I, but our whol
e, family, because he was 
the resourceful one. And while my father 
di Œ was a wonderful man, but it Œ for 
peace time. He was not very good during 
the war. I mean, for Œ for these very 
difficult conditions. Not difficult, where you 
really couldn™t just go a straight line, 
my father was a straig ht, very straight pe
rson. So anyway, my 
father da Œ so we 
went south, and I don™t reme mb er how we 
traveled. I think Œ I don™t reme mb er, you 
know, all I remember is 
that in the south of 
Hungary
, we stayed on a farm with  
some people, and Œ Hungarians. And it 
was wonderful, because it was Œ it was 
spring by then. And we stayed
 there through the spring, 
and it Œ I think th rough the 
spring. Maybe fo r Œ for a month or six week
s. And there were animals. I remember I 
learned how to cut the wool off Œ they ha
d angora rabbits, and so they taught me 
how to do th at. That™s sort of nice, and th
en how to weave. I c
ould weave yarn. They  
had a spindle, or whatever it™s called, a
nd I could weave angora into wool; I was 
very good. Anything with my  hands, I was 
very good at. And act
ually I had my first 
romance there, there was a boy of 17 or 16
, he was mu ch ol Œ and he was on the 
neighboring farm, and I learned how to  ride 
a bike at that point, because he taught 
me how to ride a bike. And there was a 
little river where we used to go and walk 
along and look at pebbles, 
and do things. So th at was ve
ry nice there. During that 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
132
time my father went back to 
Poland
, to 
Kraków
, because he thought that he would 
be able to go back there and resume 
life there. He did 
not want to go to  
Palestine
, he 
was never a Zionist, and he also knew that conditions in 
Palestine 
were very bad. 
And he was a banker, and I remember he even
 Œ I remember his words. He used to 
say that the German bankers, there we
re many German bankers, much more 
prominent, who had gone there in the 30s an
d were still walking 
around with a cane. 
You know, with a little walking stick, because
 they had nothing to do, and Œ and so 
he felt that he couldn™t Œ wouldn™t want to 
go there, he couldn™t make a living there. 
He could also not even contribute anything to the country,
 because he didn™t have a 
Œ that kind of a skill. So 
Palestine
 was out. He thought that he could go back  to 
Poland
. The reason he thought he could go back to 
Poland
 is because there was a 
government in exile in Œ in 
Lo ndo n
, headed by 
Mikolajczy k
 was h is name, an d my 
father thought that it was going to  be a demo cratic 
Poland
, and he thought he could 
repossess whatever he had, and start life 
again. He was robbed on the train going 
there. He got to 
Kraków
 and he saw the Russians had occupied 
Poland
, and 
[indecipherable] 
but of course, conditions were mu
ch better already. But he saw 
that there was no one to talk to, that that
 Œ no one was Œ you know
, he would have to 
deal with the Russians. Anyhow
, he came to the conclusion 
he couldn™t do it. So he 
came back to Œ to 
Makó
 and he decided that we should go to  
Vienna
, which was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
133
actually, in the long run, a good decision, be
cause he had a great deal of property in 
Vienna
. 
Vienna
 had just been liberated, and 
Vienna
 was in four occupational 
zones. An d he would establish the fact th
at he survived, claim whatever he had 
claims on, and he thought maybe there. 
So that I remember, we went back to 
Budapest
 and from 
Budapest
 we took a train. And by then  there was a train going, 
but there were like millions of people on 
th e station, everybody had bundles and it 
was cold and it Œ it was horrible. 
It was really quite difficult. 
Q: Speaking of 
Budapest
, if we can just back up a little
 bit, when you were there, 
had you ever hear
d of a man named
 Raoul Wallenberg
? Were you in safe houses 
when  you were there? What did you know about him? 

A: We Œ I knew a lot about him, I had 
heard ab out him, because my  uncle kept 
talking ab out him, and he tried to get 
into those houses. My Œ my  uncle tried 
everything, and he was aware, but we didn™t 
qualify, so we couldn™t get into one of 
those ha Œ those houses, because we were
 Œ had Christian pape
rs. We actually had 
papers, and they didn™t Œ they were taki
ng Hungarian Jews who 
had no other identit 
Œ so we did not Œ th ere was no way they 
were going to  take us. And we were not 
even Hungarian. So, you know, if Œ if Œ if Œ even if Œ if 
Wallenberg
 himself would 
have agreed  to take us, the other Hungar
ians would have been very upset by us, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
134
because there were mi Œ lines and lines of
 people waiting for that, it was like a safe 
haven. Yes, we knew about him, yes. 
Q: And now to go forw ard, did Œ did you 
re-recover your health qu Œ quite quickly, 
or your physical condition once 
you were with your parents? 
A: Yes, very, very quickly, because the 
Œ as I said, the conditions in the country 
were good. We had fo od, we had a room, 
we had Œ you know, my  parents had a Œ a 
Œ a si Œ a room. It was a farmhouse,
 and so yes, very quickly.  
Q: Did you talk to your mo ther or your
 father about wh at you had gone through 

without them when you were th-the Œ wh en
 you were not with them, you were with 
your uncle. Did your mo ther ask you specifically Œ 
A: No, no. No, we never talked about. I me
an, maybe we talked about it, th Œ you 
know, the siege, and in the cellar, yes, we ta
lked about that. But I 
don™t think th at we 
dwelled on what we went through. I mean, 
th at wasn™t what Œ what this was all 
about. It was getting Œ lo-looking forward, 
and I think we talked a lot. I remember, 
you know, my  Œ about I had to start goi
ng to school some point. I was very 
concerned about that, you kn
ow. And Œ and where are we 
going next, and Œ and we 
talked more about that than
 what we went through actu
ally, because that was not 
very relevant at the moment, it was over. I 
mean, you didn™t want to, didn™t get you 
anywhere. So I don™t remember
 talking a lot about what we
 went thro ugh or not, no. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

135
Q: Did your uncle arrange for the farm in 
Makó
? 
A: I don™t think so. I think my  father did.
 I think we went down th ere, looked ar Œ 
looked Œ I don™t rememb er the details. I 
don™t even reme mb er how we got there, 
whether it was by train, or Œ mu st have 
been by train, because th-the Œ the Œ 
probably the Œ the trains were already runn
ing. Or by truck? I don™t know. I don™t 
know, but it mu st have been 
my Œ my father, because my
 uncle was gone by then . 
He was gone, he Œ he left right away. So, 
th en we aw Œ took th is horrible train ride 
to 
Vienna
, and we arrived in 
Vienna
 and we went to where my  parents ho-home 
was. My parents lived in a townhouse, on 
three floors, like the little townhouses in 
New York
. And again, there was a caretaker in
 the basement, and she was a woman 
who, of course, reme mb ered my  parents, wa
sn™t that long, and 
my  father decided Œ 
he stayed for a while, went around to a
ll kinds of lawyers and things, and again, 
conditions in 
Vienna
 were very, very bad. Now, I re
memb er it being co ld, and that™s 
why I™m confused. It mu st have been 
like March, maybe. Because I remember it 
being cold. So I think it was 
something like March, 1945. It
 was just be Œ just bef Œ 
Q: I thought you Œ but in the spring
 you were on the farm, weren™t you? 
A: Well, that™s just it. We were liberated 
in January . We went do
wn soon after, so I 
think we might have been like, you know, 
end of January, four weeks in February 
and in March we got to Œ to 
Vienna
. Because it was still cold, and th ey decided, or I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
136
decide Œ everybody decided 
I was going to  go to school
, and my  brother was going 
to go to school. Pro Œ bu
t the main reason for going to
 school was food, because 
there was the United Nations, 
UNRRA
 provided  soup for child
ren in school. So we 
had one hot meal. One day it was bean 
soup, and one day it was pea soup, I 
remember it alternated. Now, the i Œ I rememb er the school as be
ing very interesting 
because I spoke German, but 
I didn™t know very well how 
Œ I Œ I knew how to read 
and write. But Œ 
Q: Read and write German? 
A: Read and write period. Some language
. I knew how to read and write in Œ in 
Polish, which is what I learned. But if
 you know how to read
 and write in one 
language, and it™s Latin characters, you can figure it out. And I knew how to  speak 
German. So I knew how to read a
nd write in German, more or less. 
Q: Did you know Hungarian? 

A: I learned Hu ngarian, fiy Œ ha Œ but on
ly by ear, just for Œ and both my  brother 
and I spoke excellent Hungarian, and we 
spoke to each other Hungarian, because 
that was the goal of our being there, beca
use the whole version 
of us being with 
these people in Œ in Œ in 
Buda
 was that we were some re
latives, and that they didn™t 
want us to be in the center of
 town, so this was a little o u ts
ide, so it was less likely to 
be bomb ed, and that was always Œ or visiti
ng relatives, so the per Œ so we did have 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
137
to speak Hungarian to each other, we 
didn™t run around speaking Polish. So 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What did you speak to
 your parents in, Polish? 
A: Yes, always in Polish. So
 we got Œ wh en we got to 
Austria
 Œ to Œ to 
Vien na
, the 
house, the build ing wh ere we lived, or th
e hou Œ townhouse, was in the Œ in  the 
British zone, which was one of the better zones to be in. And the city was divided, as 
I said, and I remember only that my father
 took me to the lawyer, and gave me a 
power of attorney , which was terribly imp Œ 
I was very impressed with that, because 
he Œ he Œ they were going to  go back to 
Poland
, my  parents, and they  decided they 
were going to leave us, because they still 
thought they could maybe make it there. 
And also, they also half-hea
rtedly by then  decided that
 they would emigrate. And 
the only place where we could go 
would be Œ you™re going to Œ 
[b rea k]
 
Q: Ready? 
A: My parents decided to go back to 
Poland
 because in order for us to emigrate, we 
did need to emigrate from 
Poland
. We were Polish citizens and that™s what the law 
was at the time. From 
Vienna 
we could not go anywhere. We also needed to see 
where we could go, wh ere we could get visas,
 and start applying for them, and all of 
this had to be done from 
Poland
, because we were Polish 
citizens. And, so my 
parents decided that they would establish 
the fact that th ey survived, and claim 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
138
property in 
Vienna
 that they had before the war. A
nd in  order to establish the fact 
that they had survived,they were going to leave my  brother and me in 
Vienna
, 
because there were papers to be signed, 
and you know, it was proof that we Œ that 
we were alive and had claims. Because of th
at, my father took me
 to the lawyer and 
gave me a power of attorney , and every on
ce in a while the lawyer would come and 
get me to sign so me papers. I also had my  fathe Œ 
Q: Even though you™re minor? 
A: Even though I was a minor, because I 
guess I Œ I Œ it was some sort of paper 
declaring that that™s Œ that I was empowered
 to do it because my  parents couldn™t be 
there, or whatever. I was very impressed w
ith that. I also had plenty of money, my  
father left me money, because he left. A
nd there was nothing to buy with the money, 
because there were horrendous shortages, but horrendous in 
Vienna
. You actually y-
you know, tha Œ everything wa
s on coupons and so on. We
 ate with this woman who 
took care of the house, and Œ 

Q: Was it hard for Œ for you to ha
ve your parents go away  again? 
A: No. No. Well, yes and no. 
In some ways yes, on the other hand, I knew that there 
was no imminent danger any more, nobo
dy was going to  take us an ywhere. We 
lived in the British zone, which wa
s fairly civ ilized. Altogether, 
Vien na
 was 
civilized at that point. It 
was occupy Œ it was an occupied  city, there was order. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
139
There was a lot of military on the street, 
but there was order. No, I was not afraid, I 
was, in a way lonely . It was miserable, because my  brother, I don™t know wh ether he 
went to school or not, but
 very soon after that, he got very sick. He had a Œ an  
abscess on his neck, I rememb er like today,
 and he started running a fever, and it 
was full of pus. And I didn™t know what to 
do with that. So what
 I did was, I took 
him Œ would be interesting to see what 
h e  rememb ers, I  to ok
 him to the Polish 
committee, because they
 Œ the Œ I knew that 
Poland
 was repatriating, they wanted 
all Polish citizens to go back to 
Poland
, that was after th e war. There was a 
repatriation effort. And I found a Œ some
body who was willing to
 take him by Œ who 
was going by car to 
Kraków
, it wasn™t Œ you know, 
Vienna
 and 
Kraków 
is not that 
far apart. And he took him. 
And so, because I w Œ I was a
fraid to stay with him any 
longer, because he was so si
ck, I didn™t know what to 
do with him. So I send him 
home sick, and my  parents got him. And then
 I stayed on probably another month or 
five weeks. And Œ 
Q: But was that hard
 to be by yourself? 
A: It was hard to be by myself, and it was 
hard altogether. I was Œ it was not an easy 
time. But wa Œ one funny in cident Œ not fu
nny, but interesting incident I reme mber 

before my brother left, when he was still 
well. Since I had so mu ch money, an d there 
was nothing to buy with it really
, the theater was active in Œ in 
Vienna
. So  I decided 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
140
that we should go to the th
eater. I had never been to a 
theater, but Œ so I Œ we got 
tickets, or I got tickets, and 
I went. And they  were doing 
ﬁMedea.ﬂ
 Does he 
remember that? Yes. And I t
ook Œ and we went to see 
ﬁMedea.ﬂ
 And I Œ to this day, 
you know, there I was, I had no clue wh at 
this was all ab out, except that there was 
this mother who had ki Œ was kill Œ at th
e end kills those two 
children. And we had 
just survived, and I knew th
at my mother did everythi
ng to save us. I couldn™t 
understand for the world of 
me, ho Œ why would a mother kill two children? And I

at was very Œ it was probably very  well 
done; the theater in 
Vienna 
was very, very good. So th at
 I reme mb er vividly, that 
was before he left. Then he left, and 
I was by my self, and I didn™t like the woman 
we stayed with, I didn™t Œ it was not Œ it was 
not very pleasant, yes, it was lonely. By 
that time it was lonely. Also, the school wa

 they didn™t have 
any textbooks. That was very interesting. 
They  were not allowed to use any of the 
Nazi period textbooks because they  all ha

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Riane Gruss
. This is tape number five, side
 A
, 
and you were talking abou
t the German textbooks. 
A: So, th ey were not allowed to use in the schools in 
Vienna
 after the war, any of 
the German textbooks, whic
h meant that everything was dictated to us. And it was 
so cold in the ca Œ in the cla
ssrooms, that we had to have 
gloves on to Œ to Œ to write, 
and it was very difficult, I re
member that was very diffi
cult, and it was difficult for 
me to write dictation, because also my
 German wasn™t that good. But I did 
somehow, but the main reason why we were
n™t Œ why I was, I don™t reme mb er if my  
bro Œ I think my  brother also mu st have gon
e, was that we got fo
od, that we got the 
soup, that was the main reason to be th
ere, because I don™t rememb er learning a 
whole lot there. And then afterwards, one
 day a man came to us, and to ld me Œ 
introduced himself and told me
 that my parents said that 
he should  bring me back to 
Kraków
. And he didn™t ha
ve a piece of paper, anything
 written, and I was a little bit 
leery of going with him, b
ecause my parents said that 
I had to wait until I heard from 
them, you know, that I had Œ th at was my  
Œ my  assignment. And I Œ and Œ but he 
convinced me. And I mu st have
 been very lonely , becaus
e I was happy to go. And I 
went, and I Œ the Œ he Œ and I later found
 out that he was doing wh at mo st people

were doing then, smuggling. And my  parent
s Œ he knew my  parents and they  asked 
him if he would bri
ng me back, because by then my 
parents had the Brazilian visas. 
We knew we were going to 
Brazil
. At least they knew, I 
didn™t. And they needed 
me to come back to 
Poland
. And th ey asked him, becaus
e they knew he was doing 
that, he was going back and forth, had he
 had a car. But he told them that he 
wouldn™t have room fo r me, and s Œ that he 
wouldn™t be able to do it. And that™s why 
they never gave him a piece of
 paper to Œ to te Œ a letter 
for me, that I was supposed 
to come. So Œ but then  he
 found that he had room. 
[break Œ doorbell]
 So he 
discovered that he wo uld have ro om for me
, and not only would 
he have room fo r 
me, but apparently it was to his advantage, 
because if he traveled with a girl, or a 
child or whatever, he was less suspicious 
than he would have been . And th at™s why 
he decided he was going to  take me after 
all. So he came, he contacted me, and I 

went. And we stop Œ we drove to 
Brno
, we stopped in  bro Œ 
Brno
, which is 
Czechoslovakia
 at that time. And he Œ we stayed 
in a hotel, he took a room for me, 
and treated me very well, I liked that he 
was a very nice man. And he told me to 
come downstairs and we were
 going to have dinner. And 
there was this restaurant, it 
was like a 
pensionne
. And I had a goose, he ordered 
a goose, and I™ll never forg et 
that goose as long as I live, was the best 
dinner I ever had, was wonderful. And then 
we slept, and th e next mo rning we went on to 
Kraków
. My parents, I remember, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

were very excited to see me, very happy
, because they didn™t expect that I was 
coming at all, so that was a very happy reunion. 
Q: Did you bring everything 
th at you owned with you? 
A: I didn™t own very much, yes, I 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What did you own? 

A: A bundle, I don™t know. A few Œ I sup
pose sweaters, I don™t know. I have no 
idea, I don™t reme mb er. It was not a big Œ 
I didn™t spend lo ts of time packing, like I 
do now. No, I don™t remember th at. Little so
mething. And th ey lived  in a house in 
the office of a distant relative. We couldn™t
 get back into our apartment, which was a 
government office, actually, it was a bi
ological institute, I found out. And my 
mo ther had reopened and was running the gall
ery, the antique gallery that my uncle 
and my  grandfather owned. And it was a fairly
 sort of normal existence, except that 
we, of course, we Œ again we didn™t go to 
school, and we were used mainly to walk 
from our Œ where we lived to Œ to the store, sit in the 
store. One day a week the 
beggars came to Œ to Œ because then all the 
busin esses sort of have this as a custom 
in 
Poland
, still is, where, so that you don™t have
 to deal with beggars e-every single 
day, you used to tell them to
 come on Fridays. So my job 
was to sit next to the door, 
the entrance to this gallery and tell the be
ggars to come back on  Friday. I remember 
that like today. And I wasn™t very well fo
r some reason, I don™t know why. Maybe I

was run down when  I came, b
ecause I remember that mi Œ I went to a doctor and I 
had like a general check-up. And he told my  
mother that I was fine, and as soon as I 
just lived, you know, had mo re food and so
 on, I would be fine, and I was fine. 
Basically I was very healthy. 
Q: What month Œ what month wa
s this that you got back to 
Poland
? 

A: This was Œ we left in July
, so this must Œ must have been like June. I wasn™t there 
very long, May or June, end of May or June
, it was warm already. And I just sat in 
the store, watched my  mo ther talk to peop
le and ran errands and that™s about it. We 
were, at that time, reunited with my
 grandfather, who had survived  in 
Siberia
, and 
he came ba Œ and my  aunt, my  mother™s olde
r sister, and we all lived together at the 
same time, in the same place. 

Q: What was your reaction in seeing them again? 

A: I™m not a very warm person. I keep 
thinking ev en now, you know, and Œ it was 
fine, you know, and my  grandfather was a nice man, he was quiet. What I do 
remember is that I, for th
e first time, I found about Jewish things, because my 
grandfather ate kosher, and so
 did my  aunt. And I remember that when I get Œ got 
back from 
Vienna
, my mother showed me, there wa
s this one shelf of a few cups 
and things, and she to ld me not to touch t
hose, because those we
re my  grandfather™s 
dishes and I wasn™t supposed
 to touch them. But I still di
dn™t have a clear picture as 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
145
to exactly why, but I remember
 that he was a very nice man, and my  aunt was very 
nice, and ag ain, my  concerns were differe
nt. They  were there, it was crowded. My 
parents slept Œ this was a Œ the office of a co
usin of my father™s, and he Œ this cousin 
had imports of watches, he was an importer of watches from 
Switzerland
, and Œ 
before the war. And so I rememb er my pare
nts had a war Œ it was like a wardrobe, a 

Œ or a gr Œ big cabin et, not a wardrobe, a 
big cabinet that was put down on th e floor, 

and they  slept on th at. So you know, it 
was crowded in  there, and then  my  
grandfather was there and my  brother, and we 
slept Œ I think we slept on chairs that 
were put together. It was not very comforta
ble, there was Œ so I don™t Œ you know, it 
wasn™t like you were happy to see your gr
an dfather. In a way it was almo st Œ he had 
Œ he occupied the only bed th
at was there, so it wasn™t
 so wonderful. And then, a 
little while later, we were ready to leav
e, and we left. We left by train from 
Kraków 
to 
Warsaw
. And from 
Warsaw
, we took Œ how did we get to 
Stockholm
? I think Œ 
Q: What did 
Wa rsa w 
look like wh en you got there? 
A: That was in bad shape, yeah, that wa
s ruined. But I wasn™t very impressed, 
because again, by then it was a little clea
ned up already, and it Œ while it was v ery 
destroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these 
wonderful build ings were destroyed. And it was nothing comp ared with wh at 
Budapest
 looked  like. I mean, I knew wh at the city that™s destroyed is a few hours 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
146
after, that™s very different. So I wasn™t Œ 
that didn™t make any impression on me. As 
far as Jewish memorials, we never went to
 any of them. My parents Œ you know, as 
far as the ghetto, or the site of the ghe
tto and so on. No, I 
think this is an 
[indecipherable] 
that is now very Œ you know, pe
ople do it and I™m going to  say 
something th at™s going to shoc
k everybody, but I think that Œ I my self feel that 
there™s Œ when we really ne
eded  help and su pport righ
t after the war, and when I 
came to 
Brazil
 and Œ and, you know, I 
had a need to talk abou
t what happened to us, 
in order to inform people I had close c
ontact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody 
was interested. Nobody was interested. And 
now, I almost think it™s too mu ch, and I 
my self am almo st overdosed  on the Holocaus
t, particularly on the superficial de Œ 
characteristics of it. I still very much lik
e to read books on th
e ho Œ that have 
something to  do with  the Ho locaust. No
t me mo r Œ not memo irs, you know, wh at 
happened  to  another person who had a simi
lar story like mine, I think on th at level 
it™s not interesting. But novels or fiction or
 anything that deals with the Holocaust, I 
will read, and I find some of 
them very interesting. But th
is sort of obsession with it 
now is, I think way overboard
, you know, way, way too 
mu ch. And not all of it™s 
sincere anyway. So anyhow, we did Œ I 
don™t reme mb er doing anything Jewish. 
After the war, my mother was very gratified,
 because my  parents did ask us after the 
war whether we wanted  to stay Jewish. A
nd both my  brother and I apparently  said 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
147
yes. I don™t reme mb er it v Œ I do rememb er
 talking about it, but it wasn™t a long 
discussion, it was mo re Œ don™t forg et, we
 had these Christian papers. We had an 
option to  stay who we were during the wa
r. You Œ you did have
 some Œ you had a 
possibility, and some people did.
 They just didn™t want to 
have anything to do with 
it any more. They didn™t want their children 
to have to go thro
ugh this, what we 
went thro ugh, and so th ere were all kinds of 
different solutions, let™s say, or Œ or Œ or 
roads to recovery that people opted fo
r. Op tions. So I Œ th ey asked us, and we 
decided th at we wanted  to Œ at least we sa
id that we wanted to
 stay Jewish, and the 
reason was not Œ I was too y
oung, I mean I didn™t know 
anything, I never studied 
anything, neither did my
 brother, that I-I just felt that 
Œ that we were born, that is 
like, do I want to be a blonde? No, becau
se I was never a blonde, and there was no 
reason to now become a blonde. So  now th at
 it™s over, yes, so we sa id yes. But it 
wasn™t such a big deal as it is today in
 general again, you 
know being Jewish was 
not what I always tell my husband, a full-tim
e occupation. It was just something you 
were, that™s all. So, after the war, we 
had back  our names 
and our Œ you know, 
legitimate birth certificates and the whole 
thing. And we went 
via Œ we went to 
Sweden
. In 
Sweden
 Œ we went by tr
ain, I think Œ in 
Sweden
 we had to wait a long 
time, we w ere in 
Stockholm
 for about three months. We didn™t get to 
Brazil
 til 
October, so we mu st have been there Œnot three months, maybe a little shorter, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

148
because the trip took 
about four or five weeks on the 
Œ on a freighter. At that time 
the big issue was not only getting a vi
sa, but getting tran
sportation out of 
Euro pe
 
because everybody wa
s go Œ leaving.  
Q: Before we talk about your going to  
Brazil
, let™s just talk a little bit more about 
your leaving to go to 
Sweden
. What were your thoughts ab
out having now to go to 
another country? 
A: Actually, that was a very positive expe
rience. And actually, 
I should b
acktrack a 
little bit. I think from 
Kraków
 to 
Warsaw
, on th e way to 
Brazil
, I later remembered 
we did fly. And I remember it was an airp
lane that did Œ had seats all around, it 

didn™t have seats in rows. And it wa
s a short flight, it™s not very far.  
Q: Th-This is a flight to 
Sweden
 you™re talking about? 
A: No, it was the flight from 
Kraków 
to 
Warsaw 
on the way to 
Sweden
, and then 
in Œ from 
Warsaw
 to 
Stockholm
, I really don™t know how we went. As I said, I 
think it was by train, but I couldn™t swea
r. I don™t remember how Œ how we got 
there, all I remember is that we did get there.  
Q: So you don™t rememb er th
e voyage over the water to 
Sweden
? 
A: No, we definitely did not go 
by ship. We went
 by ship from 
Sweden
, from 
Göteborg
 to 
Brazil
, y eah, that was by sh 
Œ by ship. Going to  
Sweden
 was a 
wonderful feeling, because going Œ 
Sweden
 we knew was a neutral country during 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
149
the war. It was kind of heaven, you know, 
going to a neutral country, a country  that 
was never destroyed, never 
had any part in any war. It
 was wonderful, and we knew 
it was a good co untry and a prosperous count
ry and that we would be comfortable 
and Œ and we were. And Œ 
Q: Were you unhappy about leaving 
Poland
? 
A: No, I was not unhappy ab out leaving 
Poland
 because I really had no roots in 

Poland
. I never went to school in 
Poland
. I was actually, between 
Vienna
 and our 
leaving, was only ab out two months. So I 
was only th ere for about two months, and 

also ba Œ by Œ by th
e time I returned from 
Vienna
, when this man took me home to 
my parents, I was told that the reason they
 brought me over is because they already 
had the visas and it was just a ma tter of ge
tting ev erything else settled and we were 
leaving. So it wasn™t like you know, I was 
settling down  anywhere
. So I was very ha 
Œ then th ere was a good feeling. Leaving fo r 
Sweden 
was a good feeling was Œ 
because it was the beginning of something 
new and something that we knew had to 
happen, is us settling somewhere. Now 
Brazil
 was the goal and 
Sweden 
was 
certainly a good and easy country to Œ to
 wait in. And that™s 
what happened. We 
waited in 
Sweden
 in Œ in 
Sto ckholm
 we stayed in Œ in zak Œ some sort of a 
pensionne
, board ing house, very  comfortable.
 And th e only thing we thought was 
terrible was the Swed ish food, which is very
, very different from any food we had Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
150
we ever had before. There™s a lot of, as yo
u know, cold  fish and herrings and so on. 
And in addition to th at, they have Œ their 
desserts are not sweet, so we were shocked 
that things that looked like 
a cake, turned out to be salty
. So th Œ it was always a bit 
of a surprise. The other thing that stru
ck us, and we mu st have arrived in 
Sweden
 in 
August, because they 
have very little sunshine there,
 and the minute the sun would 
come out in front of the opera, we Œ we
 lived not far from the opera, there were 
steps, and there were these people sitting 
down and with their 
faces leaningup and 
looking at the sun, an d you know, every fe
w mo ments of sunshine was a big thing. 
So we found that peculiar. 
Q: How did you adju st to a new language? 
A: We didn™t understand, of
 course, Swedish. A little bit it™s like German, so there 
were some word s that we could make out.
 And again, it was not a big Œ it was not a 
big problem. We st-stayed in th is board in
g house, our needs were taken care of. 

What was a big problem was that my  father
 went Œ while we were waiting to go to  Œ 
to get the ship
 to go to 
Brazil
, he decided to  go to  
Switzerland
 and look around, 
because he was beginning to thi
nk what he was going to do in 
Sweden 
Œ in
 Brazil
, 
and the reason we were going to 
Brazil
 was that his former partner from 
Switzerland
, from his branch in 
Switzerland 
was in 
Brazil 
since 1940, and was 
doing very, very well. And the idea came up,
 I don™t know if my father initiated it, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
151
or this Œ his name was 
Landau
(ph), Mr. 
Roman Landau
(ph) Œ or wh ether Mr. 
Landau
(ph) initiated it, but I Œ my father
 had very good 
connections in 
Switzerland 
in the Œ in the watch industry,
 because he financed Œ first 
of all, he was there during 
World War I, and Œ and so he somehow knew 
many of the people. But in addition to 
that, he financed the Œ hi
s cousins representation of 
Omeg a
 and 
Tissot
, which were 
two very well-known  makes of Swiss watches.
 And my Œ my  father™s cousin had the 
representation of these two brands for 
Poland
. 
Omega
 particularly was very 
successful before the war, and my
 father was Œ had a partner 
[indecipherable]
 
finance his cousin, or whatever. So  anyhow
, he had connections, and his idea was to 
go to 
Brazil
, and with the capital from Mr. 
Landau
(ph), with his help, which was 
more like he owed my fa
ther wha Œ he Œ they Œ 
my  father would open a 
representation and import of Sw iss watches.
 And that actually was his busin ess, and 
he went to  Œ to 
Switze rland
 in  order to talk Œ to see Œ t-to develop some 
relationships with manufacturers. And so he
 went for about two or three weeks. And 
in 
Sweden
 there wasn™t mu ch going on, becaus
e we were just waiting for passage 
and Œ and he knew th at we we
ren™t getting it so soon, there were, as I said before, 
thousands of people waiting for passage out of the Œ 
Q: Did you Œ did you so cia
lize with any of the childre
n who were waiting to leave? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
152
A: No, I don™t rememb er. No. We stayed
 in this boarding 
house, and I don™t 
remember any children, no. A
ll I reme mb er i s my  mo th er 
Œ my mother wasn™t well Œ 
by the way, she miscarried at that time. Sh
e became pregnant after the war, which to 
her was Œ she was terribly upset about, bu
t she only told it to 
me la Œ many years 
later. But I did know that she was very, 
very  sick and she was bleeding. And she 
later told us this very movi
ng story that after my father
 left, she realized she was 
pregnant, and sh e certainly couldn™t now arrive in 
Brazil
 with a new baby, and we 
were grown, and it was Œ she was terribly up
set and tried to get an abortion. There 
was no ab ortion in Œ in 
Sweden
, which I Œ it was a surpri
se to me, a progressive 
country like that, you couldn™t get an abortio
n. I remember her going to  the doctor 
and I went with her to the do Œ what did I do?
 I just sort of stay
ed with her and with 
my brother, I mean, that™s all 
we did. And Œ but I had no 
clue as to why. And then  
she induced the miscarriage. 
So I reme mb er there was a lot of blood and she told  me 
that was a very heavy menstruation. I was 
the one that was cleaning it up. So that 
was not a happy thing, but 
I didn™t know that it was th
at until many years later. And 
then she recovered and we waited, and my  
father came back, even
tually, we went to 
Göteborg
. And that I remember, that trip from 
Stockholm
 to 
Gö teb o rg
, I 
remember very well, because
 it was a beautiful train ride, just beautiful. And we 
went to Œ and in  
Gö teb o rg  
we still waited for a while. A
nd I think that Œ I don™t 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

153
know where it was, either in 
Stockh olm
 or in 
Gö tebo rg
, I think my  brother got a 
bicycle, or there was some talk about bi
cycle. I vaguely  rememb er something about 
that, but very little. And then in the Œ then 
the passa Œ the Œ the tickets came through, 
or th-the space became ava
ilable, and we went to 
Brazil
, and arrived in 
Brazil 
in 
oke Œ October, 1946, end of 
October we arrived actually the day of my father™s 
birth. So I remember that date very we
ll, because it Œ my mother always talked 
about how we arrived on his birthday. 

Q: So you were now a 
little over 14 years old. 
A: Right. I turned 14 in 
Sweden
, because we Œ in August we were in 
Sweden
, that™s 
when I turned 14. Mm-hm,
 so when I arrived in 
Brazil
, there I had fi Œ my fa Œ 
Q: O-On the boat going over, were th
ere other people who were leaving 
Europe
? 
A: Yes, a very small Œ it was a freighter, 
and there were 11 of us. There was some 
other family, whom I remember v ery va
guely, and some Œ but there were no 
children, or no youngsters, we were the 
only ones. And on that Œ on that boat, I 
learned how to play  Bridge, because the ca
ptain and purser, they had, I don™t know, 
two or three officers and th ey
 needed a fourth  hand. An
d I was the one that they 
decided to teach, I was the mo
st teachable, so I Œ I played Bridge; that™s most of 
what I remember on that boat, that I played
 Bridge, an d that some days it was very 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

154
rough, and everybody was seasick . And I fe
lt also queasy, but I was the only one 
who didn™t really, you know, throw up, so
 I was very proud of my self. But Œ 
Q: Were you looking fo rward to  going to 
Brazil
? What did 
Brazil
 mean to you at 
that Œ at the age of 14? 
A: I didn™t know anything about it, nothing. I knew it was a hot climate. I knew that 

Rio
, its capital, and that™s where we were goi
ng, was supposed to be a beautiful city. 
And also I knew that we knew a number of 
people there; that I knew. And also my  
father, not only that Œ that his former pa
rtner was there, but also my father was 
married before, so my  mo ther was his sec
ond wife, and he had tw
o daughters by his 
first wife, and the older one, with
 her husband and son, were in 
Brazil
; that w as 
another reason why we went there. And 
my  nephew, her son, was only two and a 

half years younger than I am, and a year y
ounger than  my  brother. So I knew that Œ 
that there was some sort of
 family. My father never ha
d a very good relationship 
with her before or after the war, but that™s 
a different story. Bu t 
anyhow, I knew they 
were there. And what did it mean? It mean
t a certain, imagine, permanence, but not 
a happy one. Not Œ not for me. I had Œ I ha
d Œ I was open to it, but my  mo ther was 
very unhappy, she di
dn™t want to go to  
Brazil
, so there was a lot of problems for Œ 
about that, because 
my mother really 
wanted to go to 
Palestine
. And she made it 
very clear when my uncle left, sh e wanted to
 do it. My father didn™t want to take the

chance, and of course, she couldn™t do it. But she felt that
 Brazil
 was really a very, 
very, very , you know, contrary
, different country, and she 
felt very strongly that she 
had nothing in common with that culture, and 
talked a lot about it.
 I remember that I, 
for myself, felt that she was 
exaggerating, that she was making it Œ being negative, 
and I didn™t want to be negative at that poi
nt. My father also Œ my father was a very 
positive, but my father was the kind of ma
n who, how shall I sa
y? If he decided to 
do so mething, he would Œ he 
Œ he didn™t have second th
oughts, he would make an 

effort to make it work. And she was a mu
ch more kind of in
tuitive and emotional 
person. Anyhow, she felt that 
after surviving the war, there 
was really nothing for in 
Brazil
. It was a strange country, a tropical country , she kept saying it was a tropical 
country, a strange country, and it really ma
de no sense to go th ere, and she was very 
unhappy about it. And when  they  argued abou
t it, th-the interesting thing was that 
she used to say that my  brother, who wa
s mu ch mo re Œ you know, was younger and 
much more sort of very different, less settle
d than I was at that Œ you Œ she used to 
warn my father and say, you 
na Œ he™s going to  get used  to
 this country, and you see, 
he™ll end up marrying out of faith. An
d that did happen  eventu ally. So Œ 
Q: When  you had quiet mo ments with your 
mo ther, let™s say on the voyage, or other 
times, did you and sh e talk 
about the difficult times in 
Siberia
, or the train ride to 
Siberia
? Did she ever Œ did you ever ta
lk that over with her, that Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
156
A: She used to talk a lot 
about it, because to
 her, what we went through, the war, 
was very much alive, and to me also. And 
she used to talk a lo
t about it, more in 
relation to what was expecting us. Her attitu
de was, we went through so  much, and 
is this what we went it through for? And 
so she would bring th
ings up, and Œ over 
and over. I can™t say that I was sitting ther
e patiently talking ab
out it, because my 
attitude was more like my father™s. We™re 
coming here, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ I didn™t 

want it to be that negative because I di
dn™t Œ I didn™t worry about my fa Œ my 
brother marrying out of faith, I mean I Œ 
you know, I had other problem, I had other 
Œ I thought she was exaggerating, I thought, 
you know, let™s give this country first a 
Œ a chance, and then  see maybe it will be
 a nice country . Who knows? Why say in 
advance that it won™t be? And so yes, she 
talked a lot about wh
at Œ what we Œ we 
had gone through, and so on, 
yes. But how mu ch I did of that, I probably listened. 
And some of the stories Œ she, by the 
way, was a great, as I mentioned probably 
earlier, she was a great storyteller and sh
e was amusing and Œ 
and so on. And she 
was interesting, so I probably, you kn
ow, if she had some reminiscences of 
something th at I didn™t reme mb er so well, or that was amusing to her, and at the 

time I was too young to understand, yes, I Œ 
she did talk about it, and I did listen to 
that, yes. 

Q: So now you™ve arrived in
 Brazil
? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
157
A: So now we arrived in 
Brazil
, and I Œ from that I have 
very vivid memo ries. It 
was hot. It was end of October, which is th
e beginning of the brazi
 Œ of the Brazilian 
summer, an d it was very hot. And at that
 time there was no air conditioning. The 
only place that was air conditioned were cinema
s. So my mother used to say, we go 
to the ci Œ to the movies for the climate. 
And that™s the Œ that™s the only place that 
was air conditioned. They arrang
ed  for us to Œ of course my
 sister met us at the pier, 
and my father™s former partner, so there were people meeting us at the Œ wh en we 
arrived. And we Œ they rented for us tw
o rooms, and a bathro
om, and a little kind of 
Œ I don™t know if it was a kitchen or whatever, in a residential hotel. And all I 
remember from that, that it 
was beastly hot, and it was full of cockroaches. Because 
cockroaches in 
Brazil
 at that time were numerous. And 
so  my mother used to say, 
when  you want to go 
into the bathroom, you have to
 knock first, not to see if 
somebody™s there, but to frighten th em
 away. And that™s exactly what I 

[indecipherable]
. And that was horrible, that was ju
st awful. It was a horrible place, 
th Œ and it wasn™t Œ it was in the best part
 of town, it wasn™t like it was the slums or 
anything. But that Œ thos
e were the conditions in 
Brazil
. It was not a super luxury 
hotel, it was a Œ some sort of middle class 
kind of residential hotel. I have a very  
vivid memory of the second evening we were
 there, we were invited to dinner, to 
my father™s former partner™s house. And 
they lived in a really, really  wonderful,

158
luxurious, enormous kind of apartmen
t that exists to this day only in 
Brazil
, it 
doesn ™t Œ y-you Œ nobody in 
America
 lives as well as that. An
d they were very, very 
well-to-do, they Œ he made a lot of money during th e war on th ings like quartz and 
all kinds of raw materials.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Riane Gruss
. This is tape number five, side
 B
. 
A: And so we were invited there for dinn
er, and we went. And 
of course, during th e 
Œ first of all, the dinner was so unbelieva
bly elaborate and beautiful, and butlers in 

white gloves serving and candle lights on the 
thing. I™d never seen anything Œ on the 
table, candle lights, silver, porcelain. I 
mean, it was really, 
even by my  today 
standards, it Œ it would still be very impre ssive because people don™t live that way in 
Œ in 
America
 with, you know, we had practically
 two servants per person at this 
dinner. So anyway, during that dinner, of 
course, the conversation was about what 
we went through, you know, wh
at happened  wi Œ to us 
during the war and so on. 
And at the end tu Œ my  parents sort of told
 th e story. I, of course, at age 14 was very, 
very quiet and I didn™t say anything, my  
brother didn™t say anything because we just 
sat there and Œ and were stunned by the wh
ole thing. And when  she finished telling 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
159
what happened to us, 
our hostess said Œ she said, oh my 
God, she said, this is nothi Œ 
what you went through is nothing comp ar
ed what we suffered not knowing where 
you were and what was happening. And I sa
id to my mother Œ 
this I remember Œ 
when we left that evening, 
I said to my mother, I™m neve
r going to talk about what 
happened  to  us to an ybody. They don™t u
nderstand. They don™t Œ it™s no use, beca Œ 
and I really did do that, I did not talk to
 people what happened . An d later on, when I 
went to school, and I should th en tell you 
how and wh ere and so on, I also found th at 
as a result of what happened
 to us, or to me, I had ve
ry little rapport with youngsters 
my age, very, very little. Because I always fe
lt that whatever inte
rested them was so 
Œ today I would use the word su perficial, 
it wasn™t superficial, 
it was Œ they were 
real teenagers, and they were interest
ed in clothes and lipstick. Again, in 
Brazil
 this 
was very Œ still is a primary concern of a 
teenage girl. And Œ an
d I became later on, 
a little interested in that, but it wasn™t lik
e Œ you know, I had so many other things 
that happened to me. But they
 wouldn™t understand, so I didn™t have Œ I didn™t have 
a lot in common with them. That
 was a big problem for me.  
Q: Was there any other girl your age that you could co nfide in? 

A: Did I have a best friend? I had a couple 
of friends, but I wouldn™t say that any of 
them, as I said, I mean th
-they were all Œ had been
 there during th e war, in 
Brazil
. 
They were Œ the people I b
ecame friendlywith eventually, 
were actually children of 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
160
people from 
Europe
, not necessa rily survivors, beca
use I didn™t know that many, 
but people who went to 
Brazil
 in 1940 or 1939, who got
 out, were able to leave 
Euro pe
 before the war, and came there and 
lived extremely well. I mean, wa Œ I 
can™t tell you how well people in 
Brazil
 to this day live, com 
Œ you know, th-they™re 
wealthy people, live extremely well. So, I ha
ve a couple of very close friends, pa Œ 
the daughter of one of my  parent™s good frie
nd is a very good friend of mine to this 
day. I did, but on th e whole, classmates 
and parties and all of that, was something 
that was very difficult for me. I mean, I wa
sn™t interested, I Œ I felt I was like Œ like 
an adult at a children™s party, that™s how I felt. 
Q: How did the teachers at school treat you? 
A: I should really backtrack and tell you ab out my  school experience, because I 
arrived in 
Brazil 
at th e age of 14, and basicallyhad no school, because I was in 
school about 10 months in 
Siberia
, in first grade. I was in school after that again, 
after the war, in 
Vienna
 for about six weeks or two months. I was taught by this 
lady, this Polish lady in 
Hungary
, and by my mother, so I la Œ that™s how, at some 
point I learned how to read
 and write. Probably in first grade, but that was in 
Russian. And just before they deported us, 
I was in school for about two months or 
so, because I remember making lines and lines and lines of 
A
s and 
B
s, that™s how 
they taught at that time. So 
that was in Polish. So basicall
y I had never really been in 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
161
school properly. So here I was, and I was 
14 years old, and I need
ed to go to  school. 
So my parents found out, and 
I found out that the Brazilian 
system is exactly like the 
French sy stem. Which means th
at you have to Œ they can
not put you any higher than 
sixth grad e, because you don™t earn credits
, you have to  work  towards the baccal Œ 
baccalaureate, or wa Œ how you spell it, 
how you pronounce it, and they wouldn™t 
take me above the sixth grad e. They were 
willing to take me into the sixth grade, 
and then  I would learn Po rtuguese, and so 
on. So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese. 
This, to me, was like part of the war. It wa
s a terrible disappointment, because here I 
was, I was 14 years old. To 
go into the sixth grade wa
s so humiliating. And I was 
also very tall, I was as tall 
as I am today, or if not ta
ller, cause I™ve begun to shrink. 
But Œ so  this was a terrible, terrible blow
 to  me, and there was nothing you could do 
about it. So someone told me
, and that was my lifesaver, 
that there™s an American 
school. And the American school does let yo
u earn credits, and it only counts from 
the ninth grade. I was the right age for the ni
nth grad e, so if they
 would let me start 
in the ninth grade, then I had a chance to
 Œ to be with people my  own age, and 
graduate on time. Problem was that I didn™t kn
ow any English at all, just like I didn™t 
know any Po rtuguese. So, I Œ of course, my
 parents were convinced that it was six 
of one, half a dozen of the other, I did ha
ve to learn a new langua
ge, and that wasn™t 
the problem. And I mu st say that I went
 with Œ I had to go with somebody who 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
162
would in terpret for me. So I went with my
 half-sister, she spoke ex cellent English, 
she Œ she was at the interpreters™ school in Œ in 
Switzerland
 before the war, her 
English was excellent. And she went w
ith me. And we spoke Œ we got an 
appointment, we went there and they told
 me that if I lear
ned English between 
October, end of a Œ now it™s Novemb er alre
ady, middle of November, and March, 
because the school year in 
Brazil
 begins in Œ on th e firs
t of March. The long 
vacation because of the summer 
season is in the Œ is in 
the winter. So, they would 
give me some sort of an exam, that woul
d have a little b it of social studies, they 
gave me some Œ they gave me a textbook. 
General science, a little mathematics. So 
basically sort of a Œ some kind of founda
tion. And some Englis
h and if I could pass 
that exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu 
Œ go into  ninth grade. Now, wh en I took 
th  Œ I studied like crazy from that day on 

until March first. And then my mother used 
to say that was Œ we had an armchair Œ 
oh, ev entu ally we mo ved, we
 got an apartment. We had 
armchair th at she used to 
say she could have sent easily to take 
that exam, because an armchair was so 
saturated with my sitting in there and st
udying. I studied from 
morni Œ morning to 
night, I had a dictionary. 
I had no lessons, nobody help
ed me, really. My sister 
occasionally helped me a little, but I really
 did it by myself with a dictionary, and 
my father knew a little English and some
how Œ and the American school was 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
163
unbelievable, they were so supportive, they
 really were. And when I was taking that 
exam, they gave me a dictionary, they let 
me use a dictionary. And in Œ and th e only 
funny experience I had with that was that
 my mathematics was quite good, I was 
always good in math. And Œ 
but one of the examples on 
that exam had to do with 
dimes, nickels and quarters. And of course, 
there I had no id ea what that was, and I 
had to leave that question out, but it was th
e only one I left out, so I did very  well. 
And I started ninth grade at th
 Œ and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did 
very well. And I graduated from Œ from the 
American school wh en I was 18, four 
years later. And that™s wh
at brought me to the 
United States
, because the American 
school did not have rights in 
Brazil
, so I could not have gone 
on to Œ to 
a university 
or anything. So that fa Œ and I did want to
 leave, but it was because of that I really 
had to leave, unless I Œ I could have g
one to a secretarial school and become a 
secretary, and there was some talk of do
ing that, but I didn™t want to do th at. 
Q: Did the teachers at the American school
 ask you about your 
background, or be 
sympathetic, or be good listeners? 
A: I think th ey knew about our Œ my  backgr
ound, and I wasn™t the only one, by the 
way, there were three other surv ivors™ child
ren in my class. So I was not the only 
one any more. And we all did very well, by 
the way, all of us, because Œ because we 

worked so hard. We were so
 serio u s, we Œ you know, scholastically, we did very 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
164
well. The teachers did not Œ teachers at th
at time, I don™t know how it was in the 
United States
, but teachers were not really inte
rested terribly much in what you 
thought or didn™t think, or
 what you did do Œ went th
ro ugh or didn™t go through. 
They  were supportive, they help ed you if
 you needed  help , th
ey were nice. No, I 
don™t rememb er having any 
kind of contact about that. 
Q: You said there were three other children. 
A: Yeah, they were not 
chil Œ you know, teen Œ 
Q: Teenag ers. Did you four
 get together and talk? 
A: Yeah, yes, they were Œ they Œ we defin
itely were a lot together, because we had a 
lot in common. One of them was a boy, an
d he was two years older than I was, and 
he was in the same b Œ he was unlucky en ou
gh to be to Œ so he graduated two years 
later, cause that was the only 
way you could do it. So he 
was there and th en one of 
them was a distant, very distant cousin of
 my  mo ther™s, and her daughter was there 
and she was also two years older than I was. 
Q: Did you exchange stories? 
A: Did we exchange stories? I knew her st
ory, yes, and she knew my  story; with  
him, no. No, I don™t know what Œ I wasn™t
 that terribly friendly with him. I don™t 
know what he went through. I 
knew thought, that he did Œ 
I think he lost his family, 
because he was living with 
an uncle. So I do Œ but I di
dn™t Œ we didn™t go around 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
165
asking people, you know, wh at
 did you or did you not Œ everybody™s story was, in 
some ways, simi lar. I mean, you knew that if
 he survived  Œ he also was on Christian 
papers, I knew that. So, I don™t know wh ether I knew it because my  mo ther knew Œ 
my  parents knew these families, or knew ab
out them. So whether that™s how I heard 
that they survived Œ I heard more how pe
ople survived from my
 parents than I did 
directly. By then, people like Œ like him a
nd my  Œ the other youn
g Œ the other girl, 
were more interested in the day to day,
 you know, getting Œ doi
ng what we had to 
do. There Œ there wasn™t mu ch time to sit 
around and talk about wh
at happened . So Œ 
Q: Did you keep any kind of a journal, or
 did you do any kind 
of writing of your 
memo ries of what you had been th
rough during the war, at that time? 
A: No, I never really wrote diaries, and no
, the answer is no. I have, to this day, 
something very funny. It™s a Œ it™s an em
broidery, and it™s a rectangular, like a Œ a Œ 
it™s like a d o ily, but it™s embroidered in a Œ in
 a stitch, it™s not crocheted. And I got 
that at some point, I think in 
Hungary
, because very often my
 mo ther would buy Œ I 
loved to sew and I was very good at it,
 I was always very
 good at knitting and 
embroidering and all of that, and that kept me
 busy. So, I Œ so this thing, I finished 
after the war, and I brought it with me to 
Brazil
. So in the middle Œ in the center of 
it, I wrote it was embroidered during th e war 
years of 1940 to  ™45. I have it to this 
day. Did I keep journals? No, no, I never di
d that, no. The Œ a closest thing I kept to 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
166
a journal was when I came to brazi Œ to 
America
, I Œ I was here alone, I wrote home 
to my mother Œ well, to my parents act
ually, but she was the 
one that answered 
mo re, although my  father also wrote very 
often. I wrote daily, because I guess I was 
lonely, and also I wanted them to know wh
at was happening, and I was so far away, 
and there was such a big sacrifice on their pa
rt to send me, that I sort of felt I sh ould 
do that. And my mother kept all those letters
. So those letters still exist, some of 
them are Œ most of 
them are still in 
Brazil
, my brother has them. And Œ
 
Q: Was it your desire to go to the 
United States
? 
A: Yes, I wanted to leave, 
A
, as I told you, I really didn
™t want to take a secretarial 
course and study Œ and Œ and wo rk there in
 an office, I wasn™t very much Œ very 
exciting. And I did want to le
ave, because I guess that my feeling, after a few years 
there Œ you see, going to the American sc
hool ha Œ was a Œ it was a mixed blessing 
in some ways, because my classmates, w
ho were all American, were children of 
diplomats, busin ess people, an
d they kept coming and going.
 They would stay a year 
or two or three or four, whatever. But it wa
s not Œ they were not in the country, and 
they certainly all left, afte
r they Œ we graduated, they all went back  to the 
States
 to s 
Œ to school, an Œ even  if their parents remained in 
Brazil
. So you didn™t really have 
friends. Once the school was over, you di
dn™t Œ not only friends, you didn™t know 
anyone. That was the second
 reason. The third reason was that because my  mo ther 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
167
ended up being very  unhappy in  
Brazil
, there was a lot of Œ there was a lot of 
unhappiness in Œ in my parents™ home. There was a lot of friction, there was a lot of 
unhappiness. And so I was anxious to get 
away, I really was. So, that™s why I 
wanted to go away. There were all these di
fferent reasons, but that™s what I wanted. 
Q: What were your first impressions of the 
United States
? 
A: Oh, I loved it, I loved it. Absolutely love
d it. First of all, there was another thing 
that I hated in 
Rio
 Œ although I shouldn™t really sa
y that, I Œ that I didn™t like the 
country, because it™s n o t fa
ir. The country is really 
very, very nice, and the 
Brazilians are very nice people. And I late
r on met some, and my brother did not go 
to the American school right away. He late
r transferred. So he has Brazilian friends 
galore, and Œ and also because he married a 
B razilian woman, he Œ so I know a lot of 
people Œ I knew some through him when Œ wh
en  Œ as an older sister when Œ because 
he brought these people home. And he Œ he
 Œ they™re lovely people, and they™re not 
Œ they™re not anti-Semitic, th
ey™re not Œ they™re just very nice, hospitable, warm 
people. So Œ but what I didn™t
 like there was that basically
 my social life was within 
the ca Œ what we call the colony. In other 
words, there were two Jewish clubs, and 

they were social clubs. And so the you
ng people like my self would go th ere and 
there would be a record player, and you da
nced, and you dated th
ese people and so 
on. But it was very, very provincial. I always
 used to say, by the time I woke up, if I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
168
went to a dance, or Œ and stayed out, yo
u know, til midnight and then slept late the 
next mo rning, by th e time I woke up, my  
mother knew who I danced with, what I 
did, wh ere I went and the whole thing. So  it was Œ it was very, very provincial. And 
my parents social life also reflected that, 
you know. Lot of emphasis of who or what 
and where and when  and how. 
So, because of that, I also 
wanted to leave, and when 
I came here, I had Œ to 
America
, I came to 
New Yo rk
, I had this wonderful feeling 
that nobody cared what I 
did, nobody. And I was on my
 own and I was free, and I 
didn™t have to Œ to worry 
about anybody. I did like it, even though I was alone, I did 
like it very, very much. 
Q: You were ninet Œ 19 years old? 
A: I was 18 and a half Œ 19, actually. I cam
e here in February, and I graduated in Œ 
in Œ in 
Brazil 
you graduate in Œ oh, wh en did we 
graduate? End of th e year was in 
October, and then was vacation. And I didn™t
 leave right away, because I had to wait 
for the new term here, and also because th
e wa Œ Korean  war had broken out, so my  
father suddenly got very wo
rried. And actually, originally
, I was supposed to go to 
London
. He agreed for me to go to 
Lo ndon
, he wasn™t too keen on Œ on 
America
.
 
London
, I don™t know,
 Lo ndo n
 he felt a little more comfor
table. When the Korean 
war broke out, 
Lo ndon
 was no longer an option, he was afraid of 
Europe
 and so on, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
169
and he decided Œ and Œ and 
I wanted to go to Œ to 
New Yo rk
, to 
America
. My father 
was not keen on my leaving. It wa
s my  mo ther was, and he wa not. 
Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in 
Brazil
 during high school years? 
A: None, absolutely none. Because again, in 
Brazil
 Œ the Brazilians were not at all 
anti-Semitic and the American Œ my classm
ates and so on, no, 
no. No, they were 
very Œ it wasn™t that they
 did not like me, it was that I did not have en ough in  
common with them to really Œ you know, to 
Œ to Œ to  have some kind of real warm 
friendship. 
Q: Now you™re in 
New York City
. 
A: Now I™m in 
New York City
, and again, because of what we went through, and 
also because my father was 
Œ my father, at that point, 
was beginning to Œ to be 
established. He was ma king a living, and he
 had started and Œ bu
t he wasn™t terribly 
well-to-do, because he had lo
st really everything. But Œ 
and at that time the Brazilian 
government was allowing 200 
daw Œ if you had a student,
 child, living 
abroad, they 
were giving 200 dollars a month at the 
official exchange. 
So I was getting 200 
dollars a month. My father could afford th
at, that wasn™t a big thing. But he was 
afraid that if things changed, or he su
ddenly  couldn™t affo rd it, or wh atever, he 
wanted to  make sure that I would learn, or 
be able to Œ to earn my  living as soon as 
possible. So  his condition finally
 was that if I did come to 
New York
, he wanted me

to go to secretarial school before I went to college. And that™s what I did, I took a wa 
Œ so I went first to secretarial school, and I 
finished one year of that, and then  I went 
to 
NYU
. So  Œ I don™t reme mb er what your question was about Œ 
Q: Well, it Œ I had previously 
asked you about anti-Semitism Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ but then you went on to 
talk about Œ you answ
ered that and then went on to talk 
about being in 
New York
. 
A: Yeah, well, I liked 
New York
 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What did you concentrate Œ wh at did you major in in college? 

A: I took liberal arts, and 
I Œ I did two years of it, a
nd by then I got married, so  I 
didn™t finish, because my hus
band is almost 12 years older than I am and he was 
already in business and established and we st
arted a life where I also had to entertain 
and go out and I just couldn™t 
do it all at the same time. And then  we had chil Œ I had 
children very young. 
Q: And how did you 
meet your husband? 
A: Oh, that™s actually a cute story.
 He Œ my father was a banker in 
Kraków 
before 
the war, and my f Œ late father-in-
law was in the banking business in 
Lwów 
in 
eastern 
Poland
. And so  they had done some busin ess together. They  were not 
friends, but Œ because they we
re living in different cities 
and it was a little bit Œ they

were different. But they had done some busin
ess together, and my late father-in-law 
found out from some Œ some Polish people from 
Kraków
 that Œ who were neighbors 
of his actually, in the building wh
ere he lived, was a family from 
Kraków
 who 
knew my  parents, and found out that I was here by my self, studying. So  he called 

me on night and said, my  name is 
Oskar Gruss
, and he Œ he was 
Œ said, I knew your 
father, and I would like to Œ you to come
 for dinner. Now, I had gotten quite a 
number of invitations like that, because ma
ny people knew my  parents Œ well, my 
father, before the war. And if Œ they heard that I was alo n e in 
New York
, so they 
would invite me. And mo st of these ee Œ di
nners were deadly bo
ring, terrible. So Œ 
and mo st of the names of the people who i
nvited me, prior to this call, I had heard 
about at home, you know, the Œ they Œ but th
is name I had never heard, so I decided 
that I wasn™t going to go th
ere for dinner, and rush Œ he 
wanted me to come Friday 
night. I said, I™m sorry, Friday night I can™
t. So he said, when can you? So I said, 
Monday in two week s, because I figured  ou
t Œ it took a week Œ it took five days 
actually, to write Œ to write a letter home 
and get an answ er, so that would be 10 
days. So  it gave me over two week s to fi
nd out who th is person was. So he said 
Monday in two week s, okay. And 
he said, we eat early, and 
Œ so be there at 6:30. All 
right, so I said goodbye and I said I woul
d be. And in the meantime  I wrote home to 
my parents, and I said such an 
Oskar Gruss
 called me, invited me for dinner, shall I

172
go? Who is it? So I got back an answer su
re enough, and my father wrote that there 
was such a person, he was in th
e banking business, he was in 
Lwów
, and he 
reme mb ers him, you know, vaguely, not terri
bly, but Œ and th at if I have nothing 
better to do on that Monday even ing, I can 
go, I should go. So  I decided to go. So I 
went and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I 
Œ my  mo ther-in-law Œ 
my future mother-in-
law opened the door, and I saw this blank th
ing Œ he completely forgot to tell her. 
But she caught on quite quickly , he mu  Œ th
ey mu st have talked about me, because 
once I stood there Œ first I saw this blank st
are, and then  she Œ she sort of caught on 
who I was. I introduced myself, and sh e 
was very nice. And th
en I saw the maid 
setting another place, so obviously every
body had forgotten about me. And then I 
sat Œ and she was very nice to me, and we 
sat on th e sofa and she actually asked me 
a lot about what we had gon
e through, and wh a Œ wh ere was I and what was I doing, 
and so on. So, about half an hour later, th
e key turn s in the door, and in comes my  
father-in-law first, and my future husband 
behind him. And my  father-in-law sort of 
went with  his head, oh my  God, he said, cause
 he rememb ered he for Œ that he forgot 
completely that I was coming.
 Anyhow, then we sat down 
to dinner, and dinner was 
a disaster, because my husband had a sist
er who™s no longer alive, and she was 
studying Œ oh, she was in third year 
law school, I think. And they  were in 
Wall 
Street
, and the conversation, ev
en though I knew English,
 seemed to me that I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

173
didn™t understand one word , didn™t know what
 they were talking about. And so that 
was dinner, and then  right after dinner, we
 got up and my  futu re husband said, I™m 
very sorry, but I have an appointment, a
nd he got up and he le
ft. And I said to 
my self, I™m going to  wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn™t get up 

from the table and leave. But this was ho
rrible, so I said  to myself, I™ll wait 20 
minutes and then I™m leaving. So, during 
those 20 minutes, we sat on the sofa and 
my father-in-law also sat w
ith us, my mother-in-law talk ed some more. And she was 
very nice, I liked her. And sh
e Œ and my  husband came back
 before those 20 minutes 
were up. I later found out that he
 did have a busin
ess appointment on 
Broadway
, 
not far from where they lived, at the 
Schrafft™s
, they used to meet 
there at that time, 
and he had no way of c
ontacting this person, so he ran 
over, told him I can™t be with 
you tonight, and came back, brought me hom
e. So that was very nice. That was 
very, very nice. Then I wrot
e home to my  parents that Œ described the dinner, mo re 
or less, in the way Œ and th
ere was one other detail that 
I omitted. My parents-in-law 
had the large collection of Jewish paintings
, you know, as they 
s Œ they just now 
actually was Œ part of it went to the mu seum, the Jewish mu seum in 
New York
. But 
they were all 
Oppenheimers
(ph) and 
Kaufma n s
, so they were these Jewish heads. 
And all these things were staring down  at
 me. And my father-in-law and my future 
husband, this was a Monday  night, were sitting in  
kippo t
. I had never seen that in 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
174
my life. So I was a little bit taken by that
, you know, it was such a different kind of 
home, I™d never seen anything like that. So
 that was a little strange. So anyhow, I 
wrote to my parents home about this whole 
evening, and I got a letter back from my 
father saying, in the year 1930, with 
a question mark, I rememb er sending him a 
present for his Bar Mitzvah. Why isn™t he 
married yet? So anyway, so that™s how I 
met my  husband. We started going out, he
 started taking me out. This was in 
February, so it was about a year after I came to 
New York
. And I went and Œ we 
went out from February til Œ til June. J
une I was going home 
for my vacation, 
because my s-school year was over. And I Œ he took me Œ he told me Œ he brought 
me a little radio, I remember, he brought me
 a present, the Œ the Œ just before I was 
leaving, and he said to me, I™m very sorry, 
I won™t be able to take you to  the ship to 
see you off Œ I was traveling by ship  Œ beca
use he said, it™s a holiday. And I said, a 
holiday? Well, it tu
rned out it was 
Shavuot
, which was a holiday  I never even  heard 
about. So at that point I 
found out that he™s observan
t. He kept it from me, from Œ 
from February until June, he took me out Œ I di
dn™t realize that he was ordering fish, 
because I didn™t really care what he was or
dering. But we went out a lot, and I didn™t 
realize that he was religious. Never asked 
me out on a Friday, 
but you know, th-that 
was Œ I didn™t think about it. So wh en I came home to 
Rio
, he came for the Fourth of

July week end, and he came to my  Œ to ou r home, he me t my  parents, and so on and 
so forth. And we got engaged in  September, after I came back.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Riane Gruss
. This is tape number six, side
 A
. 
What is your husban d™s name? 
A: His official name is 
Emma nuel Gruss
, he™s called 
Mike Gruss
. 
Q: And you said you got engaged, and then  Œ 

A: Yeah, we got engaged in Se
ptember, when I returned from 
Rio
, and we got 
married in December. 

Q: And you™ve lived in 
New York
 ever since? 
A: Yes, yes, I™ve lived in 
New York
 ever sin ce. We got married 1952, December 
™52. 

Q: And do you have ch ildren? 

A: Yes, we have two daughters. Our older 
daughter was born in January ™54, and our 
younger daughter was born 
also in January 1957. 
Q: Okay, did you work at all wh en the children were growing up? 

A: No, I never worked. I never worked. I 
tried to take dicta
tion from my  husband on 
our honeymoon, and I was so inexperienced 
and slow that he Œ that was my  last 
attempt. No, I never worked, no.

Q: Let™s talk now a little bit about some 
of your thoughts. Do you feel that you 
would be a different person 
today, if you hadn™t gone
 through the historical 
experience that you have? 
A: Probably yes, because when I graduate
d high school, I Œ really my dream was to 
study medicine. And whether it was a dr
eam or whether I wasn™t, you know, 
persevering enough Œ many people who went 
through wh at I went
 through did very 
well after the war. I felt that my educatio
n was like a building without a foundation. 

Was a great building, but it Œ there was Œ as
 I had great, really great shortages. I 
didn™t know many things, even  though I did 
finish this American high school, I had 
no Œ hard ly any Euro pean hist
ory, hardly an y Œ so any
how, I felt it was without a 
foundation. A building withou
t a foundation, or Œ probably, if I had had a normal 
education, I probably  would have been 
a different person. I would have been a 
different person also having lived in 
Euro pe
 and I don™t Œ I imagine so that Œ that I 
would have been very  different, yes. 

Q: In what way? 
A: I would have probably 
achieved a little more than I 
did achieve on my own, a-
after the war. As I said, I would have had 
a Œ probably  a better foundation, a regular 
education. I probably  would have been ab
le to Œ to go on and Œ an d you know, do 
either medicine, or Œ or something a 
little more concrete than what I did.

Q: In the sense of coping with life, do 
y Œ do you think that 
you got skills that 
ordinarily children don™t get, b
ecause of what you experienced? 
A: Children, or as an a Œ as an adult? 
Q: As an adult.  
A: Oh. 

Q: The adult that you became 
because of your childhood. 
A: I would think in some ways yes, that
 I Œ maybe that my  perspective on life is 
somewhat different than it would have be
en if I didn™t go th
rough what I went 
through. I had an interesting exchange just 
last week, I don™t know if it™s relevant or 
not, with  
Brenda
 ab out overpro tective parents. And I had met this young Œ youngish  
woman who has an only daughter, talking to another youngish woman who has an 

only daughter. And they seemed to be terri
bly concerned because th e class that these 
children, third graders were in, were going
 on some sort of a s-swimming Œ I don™t 
know, they Œ at Œ at some club or someth
ing, and one of the 
mothers was saying 
how she™s going also, because she™s concer
ned they won™t have enough lifeguards 
and 30 little girls swimming, and who know
s Œ and these were not even Jewish 
people, these were Catholic
 people. So I Œ I told 
Bren da
 about this, I said, I never 
was concerned ab out Œ I mean, if the school
 took them someplace, I never thought 
that there was any Œ so 
Brenda
 said, maybe i Œ and I said
, this must be because 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
179
they™re only children. And 
Brenda
 said no, maybe it™s becau
se you went through so 
much when you were a child, that Œ that 
wh at we were doing was so protected and 
so normal, never occurred 
to you that something could happen. And maybe that™s 
true, as the Œ I thought about it. It was ju
st something that happened 10 days ago, I 
started thinking about it, maybe she™s right. 
So then I said to her, so I was not an 
overprotective mother? And sh
e said no, you were not. A
nd I really Œ maybe that™s 
something th at I got out of it. On the 
other hand, from having read a lot about 
survivors, I know th at many of them are 
overp Œ very, very overprotective of their 
children. I guess the reason is 
that they feel that these 
children should accomp  Œ you 
know, that they Œ I don™t kn
ow, I don™t know why, but Œ 
Q: Did you share your st-stories abou
t your childhood with your daughters? 
A: Very little. Later on in life, when they
 became more intere
sted, because when 
they became more grown-up, and started read
ing and studying at university and so 
on, they  would ask me, and then  I would te
ll them. I didn™t want to burden anyone 

with all of that. I felt th at it was irreleva
nt, it wasn™t that Œ it was over. And no, I 
didn™t tell them too mu ch. Every once in a wh ile, I would make a comment, I 

remember, to them, you know,
 when Œ wh en  I was your age Œ you know, if there™s 
something meg Œ you know, was like highly
 exaggerated I thou
ght by th en, I would 
say, you know, wh en  I was your age, I didn
™t have such  and su ch, or I didn™t even 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
180
think about such and such. As
 a matter of fact, I did that the other day, I don™t 
remember what it was ab
out, with my grandson 
Jonathan
, and then  he started to ask 
me, well, where were you, what were you doi
ng? So I told  him. As they asked me, I 
would tell, but not Œ not share a whole lot of
 it. He Œ he said Œ he said to me, so 
where were you wh en you were my  age, 
you know. So I told 
him, that™s how it 
started, so I told him. So he said, so Œ 
so what happened? And 
Œ but then you Œ you 
Œ you Œ you stop, because it™s 
hard for Œ you don™t want to
 burden a ch
ild like that, 
and many of the things that
 happened un Œ until he studies
 history, until Œ and that™s 
what I felt with my own child
ren, until they have the hi
storical background, they 
won™t be able to Œ to grasp what happened.
 So I Œ no, I did not talk too mu ch ab out 
it, no. 
Q: You said that your hus 
Œ your father-in-law was from 
Poland
. Wh en did your 
husband come to this country? 

A: Oh, he came Œ he was very lucky, he left 
Poland
 at the a Œ my  husband did, at 
the age of 17, b
ecause in eastern 
Poland
 where he was, the 
an Œ the anti-Semitism 
was really quite a problem for Œ for all of  them, especially fo
r my  husband. And he 
left Œ actually, it™s interesting, he really 
ri Œ left for a vacation, summer vacatio n, to 
learn a little English. So his parents sent him to 
England
. And a ye Œ 
Q: What year Œ what year was that? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
181
A: ™38, a year before the war. A
nd he was supposed  to go back to 
Poland
 to finish 
his last year of Œ of the gymnasium, of Œ 
to matriculate. And he fell in love with 
England
 and freedom, and Œ and he told his 
parents he™s not going back, under no 
circumstan ces. And they were very upset,
 because he hadn™t finished high school, 
and Œ and he said he
™s not going back. And 
so he stayed in 
England
 and went to 
university in 
England
. Actually, he was able to
 convince the university in 
Manchester
, he wasn™t able to do it in 
Lo ndon
, that his, what they call the small 
matriculation, because there 
were two matriculations in 
Poland
, one was at the age 
of 16 or 15, and then there was one an Œ 
the full one was at 18.
 And he had the little 
one, and he had the Œ some sort of a dipl
oma that that was it. And so he started 
university in 
Ma nchester
. And he decide Œ and he neve
r went back , he Œ so he was 
lucky, because the war broke out 
a year later, and he was in 
England
. So, he was in 
England
, he finished the univer
sity in 1942. He came to 
America
 and he was 
drafted, he was in the army. As a matter of 
fact, he was in the Œ in the Battle of the 
Bulg e. He was Œ he was in 
Europe
, he was overseas. And Œ and then he came back 
after the war. 

Q: And what kind of work  does he do? 
A: He is a stockbroker. He™s on the exchange.

Q: Were there ever times when you were
 angry that you were Jewish, because you 
had such  a difficult child mi Œ ch
ildhood because you were Jewish? 
A: I wasn™t ever angry. 
Q: Or have any negative fee
lings about being Jewish, beca
use of what you had to go 
through? 
A: Yeah, I understand. Yes, when things 
Œ especially when the Germans were there 
in 
Poland
 and in  
Hunga ry
, I often Œ I wasn™t angry, I wasn™t Œ I often wished that I 
wasn™t Jewish because things would be easi
er, would be better, a
nd I wouldn™t Œ yes, 
but I wasn™t angry, I wouldn™t say I was angr
y. It was mo re that I wished like when 
you go to  bed and you 
fantasize about something, I 
wished often that I wasn™t 
Jewish.  

Q: Have your feelings 
changed about being Jewish
 as you™ve matured? 
A: They have changed in the sense that I no 
longer wish I wasn™t 
Je wish. I just wish 
that being Jewish, the way it is in 
America
 wouldn™t be so Œ how shall I put it? 
Wouldn™t be such an important part of my 
life. I find it Œ there™s just too much of it, 
it™s Œ it™s Œ being rai Œ I Œ you know, I wasn™t
 raised in a home that was that Jewish, 
it Œ you were Jewish, you observed, my  
parents ob-observed Passover Œ after the 
war I™m now speaking. And Œ and Yom Ki
ppur and Rosh Hashanah and that was 
being Jewish and Œ an d nobody said you we
ren™t Jewish, but that was about it. And 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

183
it was wonderful, you had thre
e big holiday s a year, and so
 on. And here I find that 
it™s just Œ I find it very confin ing, yes. 
But that has nothing to  do with the war, I 
probably  would have found it very confin
ing if I had Œ you know, if I had gotten 
from the kind of background I 
was from, into this kind of
 milieu, I may have found 
it very confining anyway. I don™t know. 
Q: You lost your childhood, in many ways. 
Did you ever feel th
at you got it back? 
A: No, no, you don™t get it ba
ck, no. You lo st it. And what
 I did feel very strongly 
when  I had my  own children was that I wa
s very involved  with th em. I took care of 
them my self, even though I didn™t have 
to, and I enjoyed every moment of it, 
because I saw Œ you know, I enjoyed when
 they went to sc
hool, and Œ and Œ and 
enjoyed the fact that th ey enjoyed le
arning and did well. 
And Œ and enjoyed 
participating in day trips, and ev erything 
that Œ I spent a lot of time doing th at, and I 
really enjoyed it. No t always because of Œ 
for them, as I felt that I o ften relived a 
part of my  life that I never had. So I think 
because of that Œ I loved, for instance Œ I 
wa Œ I™m very f Œ very few women my Œ th
at I know, my friends, loved sitting in the 
park. I loved sitting in the pa
rk with those children an
d just observing them play. 
And Œ and th e development, nobody ev er conc
entrated on that, on
 my  development, 
my  brother™s development, you know, y
ou Œ you were surviving, you weren™t 
developing. So that, I think I had from that, yes.

Q: When your daughters turn
ed the ages Œ the age that 
you were Œ let™s say when 
you and your mo ther and br
other had to Œ you know, we
re on Œ in  the train and 
going to 
Siberia
, and all those very difficult times, did that bring back memo ries for 
you? Was that an especially hard time, 
when they were the 
age that you were? 
A: No, I th Œ I do though, think, or actually 
I did often, sort of, wh en they would turn  
seven, like when  the war would break out, it™
s not that I rethough
t what happened to 
me so much as I sort of ma
rked the time and said, this is
 when Œ when it started  for 
me and Œ and lo ok what they™re like. And I was often amazed how Œ looking at 
them, how childish they were, 
you know, here they Œ and 
Œ and wh en I think what I 
was like at that age, that™s 
when I realized what the war had done to me. At sev en, 
you know, I Œ I Œ even my  
grandchildren, I look at th
em, I mean, they Œ they™re 
children. And when  I think wh at I had to do
 and what I had to go
 through and what I 
had to th ink wh en I was that
 age, yes, it™s Œ so when 
these la Œ these mar Œ these 

ages came, that Œ that were very significant
 in my life in terms 
of what happened to 
me, I would sort of look at them and say,
 my God, what was I like? How different 
was I when they Œ when  that
 happened Œ wh en Œ when  I 
was that age, yes. But not 
that I sat th ere and sort of reminisced, no. 
I™m not that mu ch of a reminiscing person. 
But that did strike me, yo
u know, when Œ when Œ and 
also the opportunities. But 
then my  husband says very often, rightly, th
at our generation, he also didn™t have the

opportunities that young people have today. 
Even though he Œ ok
ay, he went to the 
army , but Œ so Œ but Œ but Œ and he has a 
university education, but young pe Œ like 
Brenda
, for instance, she could travel, she Œ sh
e did, I mean, she did all these things. 
She went to school, she traveled, she wo rked
, she did all kinds of things before she 
got married. We didn™t have a chance to 
do any of that. The world has changed. 
Young people also weren™t as independent.
 But it often did sort of strike me how 
different their life was, and I was determined
, that I remember thinking, that I would 
make sure that Œ that this 
should not happen 
to them. Yes, I di Œ in what way? 
Maybe by living here, or wh atever, that 
Œ that I was hoping th is would never happen 
to them. That I remember thinking, yes, th
at Œ that this kind 
of thing should not 
happen to them. 

Q: Do you think it could happen  again? 

A: Another war like that, and another Œ not 
quite like that, but horrible things could 
happen, sure. Of course, yes, yes, we have
 no Œ no way of making sure that it will 
not happen. Maybe not in the same fo
rm. Probably not in the same form. 
Q: Have you experienced anti-
Semitism in your adult life? 
A: Once, in a very strange
 way in Œ actually in 
Poland
. We went back about two or 
three times. My father had property in 
Poland
, which I now have. And it was very 
strange, it was the first time we went back
, my  husband and I, 
we were together. 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

And it was in 19 six Œ no, 1
973. And we went to Œ to 
Kraków
, and we ac Œ actually, 
it was the only time in my life, including 
the wars, interestingly enough, that I 
experienced outspoken anti-
Semitism. Because during the war I never experienced 
it. I mean, I knew they were murdering Je
ws, but the Germans were doing it, and I 
personally never did. I wasn™t in school, so
 I never did. And Œ and th e Po lish people, 
I also have very strong opinions about pe
ople Œ Po lish people help ing Jews, because 
those Jews who surv ived like I did, at one
 point or another ha
d to be helped by 
Christians. Otherwise there was no hope, 
there was no way you co
uld have survived . 
But anyway, I wa Œ we were in 
Kraków
 and we went to visit 
Auschwitz
. Was a 
Sunday morning. And we came back, and bo
th my  husband and I speak Polish, and 
we had Œ we took a taxi or a driver, 
or whatever. And we came back from 

Auschwitz
, it mu st have been like two o™clockSu nday , and Œ we went early in the 
morning, and we were starve
d. So we wanted Œ but we 
didn™t Œ you feel funny after 
going th ere, funny. You feel very strange. 
And we didn™t want to go to some fancy 
place for lunch, so we decided to ask the 
driver to just take us someplace where 
there™s some food, where work
ers go. You know, a normal kind of place. So Œ so he 
said, okay, he™ll take us where he sometim
es eats and ma ny of 
the cab driv ers and 
workers eat there. So he sa
id a very unpretentious kind of Œ that™s what we were 
looking for, something unpret
entious. So he took us there,
 and it was crowded, and it 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
187
was unpretentious and it was very crowded,
 and they were sea
ting people together 
with other people. So we sat down Œ they  to
ld us to sit at a table where there was a 
young co uple. They were speaking Po
lish. My husband and I were speaking 
English, because Œ but of course, they 
were speaking Polish because they were 
Polish, and we understood every word . A
nd we sat down and we 
Œ I don™t know, we 
spoke about, I don™t know what we spoke ab
out, but we spoke English. And there 
was no menu, so we got a big plate of saue
rkraut, mashed Œ and big, big portions, 
sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and some sort 
of meat. And I Œ I™m a very good eater, 
but it was a huge portion, particularly th
ere were a lot of these potatoes. So I 
finished everything except about half th
e potatoes. And she, the young wo man, 
turned to her whoever he was, escort or
 Œ or boyfriend or husband, I don™t know 
what he was, and she said to
 him, look she Œ he s Œ she said Œ and it™s true that at 
that time th ere were still shortages in 
Poland
 Œ one always has to understand where 
it all come s from Œ and she said, look sh e™s 
Œ he Œ she said, she didn™t finish her 
potatoes. That Œ and so he said, yeah, I 
see, a nd then she said Œ she was more 

virulent than  he Œ she was virulent, he 
wasn™t. And she said, 
they™re probably not 
good enough for her. And th en
 she turned to  him and said, look, sh e has this big 
Jewish nose. It was the only time Œ and to th
is day I™m really mad at myself that I 

didn™t say any Œ something. Bu t I was so 
taken aback. Also, I 
was so innocently 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

188
accused, because I just couldn™t finish thos
e potatoes. But the point was, that this 
was the only time, in all my life Œ I to
ld my  husband Œ the only time that I 
experienced anti-Semitism, you know, in its 
rawest kind of form. So, nothing, I 
didn™t finish the potatoes, and they left, a
nd so on. I wasn™t Œ th
ey finished, I mean, 
th-they had Œ she made that one remark, and 
then she didn™t focu s 
on us at all. But it 
was interesting. So that was the only time I 
really experienced sort of Œ and that was 
after the war, way after the war. 
Q: What were some of your
 emotions wh en  you visited 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Well, it™s a pretty terrible place to visit. 
First of all, I was grateful I didn™t end up 
there. But, you know, I™ve seen photograp
hs, I™ve read about it, I knew about the 

camps already, you know, right after the e
nd of war. It just bore out what I knew 
was Œ had happened , and how 
it had Œ how it looked and so on. So  it was a horrible 
day and it™s very depressing, but na Œ I di
dn™t discover anything I didn™t know, so Œ 
Q: When your parents found out after th
e war, what had happened  to  Œ and th e 
extent of wh at had happened , was this some
thing again they shar
ed with you, or you 
talked about with them? 

A: After the war Œ well, during the war, we already knew  that some of our relatives 
are Œ were killed. We were lucky to survive,
 all four of us, but 
we knew that some of 
them were Œ my father™s br
othe Œ brother-in-law was kille
d, his niece was killed. I 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
189
knew all of that, so it wasn™t it Œ we didn™t
 Œ they didn™t wait til after the war, it was 
Œ some of them were shot be
fore they were deported, thos
e pe Œ so we knew, yes, I 
knew, of course. Tha-Tha Œ it wasn™t a big discovery after the war. There were 
maybe individual Œ again, my  situation is
 very different from other people, because 
my  parents, as I probably said at the begi
nning, were very, very wealthy before the 
war. And we are Œ were raised in 
Vienna
 by governesses and nurses. We had no 
contact with other children. And also my
 parents fo Œ the families were in 
Poland
. 
So in 1938, when  we went to 
Poland
, we still had no contact with anybody. My 
mo ther was afraid of Œ of children™s dis
eases. At that time there were all these 
concerns. So  I hardly  Œ I didn™t know my
 cousins, I didn™t Œ I met them in 
Siberia
, 
those Œ th Œ but those were the ones that went from 
Siberia
 to 
Palestine
, so I knew 
they were safe and I knew them
 a little during that one year in 
Siberia
. But I didn™t 
know my uncles, I didn™t know my aunts.
 My parents didn™t Œ it was not a terribly 
close, enormous family, it was not. So I Œ 
contrary to other people like my  Œ like my  
husband, wh en we went back to  
Lwów
, to wa Œ and also, he was older. So when I 
walked with him through 
Lwów
, he would show me, he Œ this is where Aunt So and 
So lived , and th is is where Aunt So and So 
lived, and this is where the school was, 
and this is where the synagogue was, and th
is was here, and this was there. I d idn't 
have all of that. I didn™t Œ I didn™t know wh ere my  relatives lived.

Q: Did he lose many memb ers of his extended family? 
A: 
Mike
? Yes, he did. Yeah, he lost a good number, yes, yes. His grandparent Œ I 
don™t know, yes, a good Œ a 
good number, yes. And so did 
we actually, because my 
Œ my  Œ co uple of my  cousin s, my  Œ tw
o of my  aunts on my  father™s side. My 
mother™s side, an uncle who I never met. One 
of my cousins, yes, I Œ I lost some, he 
lost some, yes. But I 
didn™t know them well. 

Q: When  you go into a room now, and 
you meet people who are amer Œ Native 
Americans, and Œ do you feel like you are 
a different person than  they are? Do you 
feel like you™re two different people, so
meone on the inside, and someone on the 
outside to the public, because of your experience? 
A: No, I do feel not two different people, I 
do feel very differe
nt from when I walk 
into an American Œ into a 
room with Native Americans 
Œ it™s not Native Americans, 
you mean Jews who were bor
n Œ born here, Americans wh
o were born here. Yes, 
very much so, yes. I do feel 
that. Don™t forget, to this da
y I have an  accent. So very 
often, to this day, I mean I still have a Œ 
an accent, I na Œ people can hear that I 
wasn™t born here. So, to this day, 
people will ask me, you know, where are you 
from, and then they  start, you know, aski
ng you wh ere you™re from, or where were 
you born. The next thing you know, they
 know that you went through the war, 

because in 
[indecipherable]
 figure out your age and so  on. So th ey Œ unless I want 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
191
to cut them short, which I do very often if 
I feel I don™t want to talk about it, then I™ll 
just say, you know, I was born in 
Vienna
, but I left when I was five. And then I 
don™t say wh ere I left, I don™t Œ I don™t tell th
em that I went east instead of west. But 
yes, yes, I do feel different, yes, definitely.  
Q: How would you describe 
yourself today? Are you 
American, are you Polish? 
What are you? 

A: Definitely not Polish, but defi Œ I woul
d say American. I Œ yes, I like this country  
the most of any country that I™ve lived 
in. I™ve been very happy here. I like the 

political system. I think definitely American. 
But as I said, I think yesterday, that I 
still feel Œ 
[ ina udible, ba ckg ro und no ise]
 I still Œ you™ll get that noise. 
[break] Œ 
that when  I see the newspaper Œ I think I sa
id that yesterday also, and there™s some 
news from 
Poland
, I will read it, as opposed to let™s say, news from 
Hungary
, 
where I was a little while, and occasionally I™ll look at it. But news from 
Poland
 I 
will read, so I must have some sort of 
feeling about knowing the country, knowing a 
little about their problems, and being in te
rested in it. Never read news about 
Austria
, don™t feel Austrian at a
ll, even though I was born th
ere. That I really don™t. 
But of course, we are all a little mi xed up 
because we Œ because of the fact th-that 
we didn™t grow up here. You know, when
 you don™t grow up someplace and you 
become naturalized mu ch later in life,
 you probably feel differently. And also, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
192
English is not my  native language, I learned it mu ch later. So, I think it has 
something to do with it. To
day, for instance, and also 
interesting, during the Purim 
celebration at 
JPDS
, where I was with 
Jonathan
 today, they were singing all these 
Purim songs, it left me cold, 
I mu st say. But when  they  sang Œ what did they  sing? 
Not the stars Œ 
ﬁAmerica, the Beautiful,ﬂ
 I felt a twinge, I really did. So yes, I do 
like this country . 

Q: How did you convey Jewish culture to 
your children, Jewish
 reli gion to your 
children? 

A: I didn™t, my husband did. I really fe
 Œ was a very m Œ I did wh at Œ wh at was 
expected of me. I didn™t put any effort into
 that at all. My husband was the one who 
cared about it. And I didn™t sabotage it, but I certainly didn™t, you know, I didn™t Œ I 

wanted my  children to be Jewish, but I didn™
t put a great deal of effort into it. It 
wasn™t may doing. If Œ if Œ if 
it worked out, it was his doing. 
Q: Are you proud th at you are Jewish? 
A: Y-Yes, but again, I don™t Œ I™m not proud
 of Œ of the way Americans feel Jewish. 
I Œ it Œ it Œ it actually upsets me. I don™t like 
the fact that they™re
 so Œ so sure of 
themselves, so cocky, so Œ there™s just Œ I 
keep thinking of it as 
just too mu ch . TooŒ 
too Œ politically when they al
so Œ all these Œ these pre
ssure groups, and all this 
Jewish stuff. And even 
Israel
 the way it™s becoming today.
 This aggressiveness, and

193
this Œ you know, we are Œ we are different, 
we are better, we are th Œ it™s just too 
mu ch for me. Am I proud to  be Jewish? Yes,
 in a quiet way, I™m very proud to be 
Jewish, but when it™s Œ when
 it becomes overwhelming, 
and overb earing and then I-
I don™t like it. 
Q: What are your thoughts about 
Germany
? 
A: Oh, 
Germany
 Œ 
End of Tape Six, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape Six, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Riane Gruss
. This is tape number six, side 
B
, 
and I was asking you y
our th oughts and Œ ab out 
Germany
. 
A: We went to 
Germany
 ab out Œ when  did we go? About eight or 10 years ago 
there was an exhibition of Œ I don™t rememb
er what it was, it was a history of the 
Jews, it was in germ Œ in 
Berlin
, and one of my mother-i
n-law™s paintings was at 
that exhibition, so we Œ we decided to go. So  we went, and I found it Œ 

Q: This is a painting your moth
er-in-law owned, or pain ted? 
A: Oh, yes, owned, owned, ow
ned. From her collection. I 
found Œ first, what you do 
is, what mo st people I think do is, you 
sort of look around
 and you figure out 
whether this person was alive during th e war 
or not. That™s what mo st people do and 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
194
I did that to some degree also. And I soon re
alized that most people were not alive, 
because they Œ they were younger, my age or younger. A
nd even if they were my 
age, then they were children
 during the war, so then I st
arted telling myself that you 
can™t Œ you know, you can™t hold Œ think a
bout that all the time, you just cannot. 
And would I want to live there? No. Do I hate them? No. You know, it™s Œ it™s hard 
to say wh at I think about them. I don™t kn
ow whether they are any wo rse than Œ I 
often wonder what would happen
 in this country if there 
would be gradually, as very 
gradually our Œ th-the Nazi 
racial laws were Œ they di
dn™t Œ they weren™t done from 
one day to  the next. People don™t realize 
that. It came on very
 gradually. If there 
would be such laws passed against the black
 population, would we react, would we s 
Œ you know, some of us maybe the vi Œ but 
mo st of us would not. We would just sit 
quietly and Œ and Œ an d probably  not go out 
and help people and 
so  on. So th erefore 

I Œ I also know that helping was very, very
 difficult during the war. It was risky, it 
was dangerous, it was more than Œ I mean, in 
Poland
 people who helped were 
executed. They Œ there was no trial, no anyt
hing if they  were caught. So, under those 
circumstances, would I do that for somebody 
else? Probably not. So  therefore I have 

no Œ I don™t hold it against them, I don™t ha
te them. That™s my feelin g. I wouldn™t 
want to live there, but then I wouldn™t want
 to live anywhere except here, so it™s the 

same Œ same thing. Bu t I have Œ I Œ no, I 
don™t hate Œ I don™t hate that Œ hate them, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
195
no. Just like I don™t hate the Poles for that 
one Œ I didn™t enjoy that one anti-Semitic 
incident, but I don™t hate them, no. I™ve ha
d some very good experiences with Polish 
people as well. We were on a hiking trip, 
I™ll never get Œ we we
nt Œ my  husband and 
I, we Œ one of the trips that we took, we went to 
Kraków
 about two Œ two or three 
years ago when I start Œ when 
they  started giving back  pr
operty, we Œ I went, and we 
saw lawyers and we did this and th at a
nd th e other. And then there was a Polish 
holid ay, so we suddenly  found ourselves 
with three days or four days as Œ a 
weekend, and over the weekend,
 and so we decided to  go to  
Za kopane
. We had to 
remain, we had appoin
tments afterwards. 
Za k o p a n e  
is in the mountains, in the Œ in 
the 
Tatra
 mountains. And both  my  husband and 
I enjoy hiking, th ey have wo nderful 
walks there, so we went. And we met Œ it 
was a sort of difficult, so mewhat steep 
hike for us, and it was after a rain, and th
ere was moss and it was a little slippery. So 
climbing up was not bad, but I was afraid 
that it™s not a loop. I wasn™t sure it™s a 
loop, and I was afraid of coming down the 
same trail. S o , there was a young woman 
with a better trail map than what we ha
d, wh ich was not very
 good. And she was 
going up and I Œ we asked he
r whether it was a loop and so on, and sh e said, yes, it 
was a loop, we didn™t have to come down 
the same  way. And then she said she was 
a very good hiker, and she said she™s going
 ahead, but she has two or three friends 
coming behind and they  are slow, and they
™ll probably  catch up with us, and we

196
should just follo
w th em, and okay, thank you very  mu
ch. We went up, and then sure 
enough th ere was a bu Œ they came up behind
 us and th en we confirmed the route, 
and then they went ahead, and they were s
till faster than we. 
And eventu ally we Œ 
we met up with them again at the top wh
ere there was a beautiful overlook. And 
going Œ so, we already had talked  with th
em, so we asked them about going down, 
which way the Œ you know, th-th-th e Œ the tr
ail, which was the be
st way to go down, 
the easiest way, we were looking for. So th
ey  explained to us, and th ey explained to 
us that at some point there™s going to be a 
V
 and we had to take an Œ but there was 
another little trail, and then you had to take 
the left, but it was difficult. They said it 
would be a little bit maybe diffi
cult to find. So, we got there, to that point, and there 
they were again. And they 
were sitting and waiting for us, and on the ground there 
was, in little pebbles, they 
had made an arrow which one 
Œ but Œ and they showed us 
that this is the arrow and they made it fo
r us. And then I said, so why are you here? 
And they said, because we were really c
oncerned about you, so we decided to wait 
for you after all. I™ve hiked in 
America
, I™ve hiked in Œ in 
Switzerland
, we™v e hiked 
in 
France
, nothing like that ever 
happened  to  us. Did they
 know we were Jewish? 
Probably yes, because the wa
y we speak Polish, th-they 
Œ we both speak well, but 
we don™t Œ y-you know, when  you haven™t be
en in a country for 45 years, even if 
you speak continuously, it™s a 
little Œ the language is alittle different. And a-also, 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
197
they knew  we had Œ were tourists, from 
the way we dress, from the way we Œ th-
there™s no Œ I mean, nobody tho
ught the Œ so that was very 
nice, very nice. Then we 
started talking so me more, they invited us 
to th eir homes, but th
ey Œ they were not 
from 
Za kopane
, they were also ther
e Œ they  were someplace from the north  of 
Poland
 where we wer Œ never went. But, 
you know, that was something and I 
thought it was very, very nice. Never happ
ened anywhere else. 
So you can™t tell. 
People are people, and they™re diff
erent, and everybody™s different. 
Q: What language do you think in ? 
A: I think probably the language I speak in 
at the mo ment, but I do th ink probably in 

Polish quite often. But probably  in the la
nguage Œ and people ask me what Œ what Œ 
you know, the classical questi
on is what language do you 
dream in? I have no idea. 
But probably the language I 
speak at the moment, I ten d  
to Œ to  do that. But I do Œ 
when I am by myself, I think I 
sp Œ I think in Polish a lot. 
Q: Tell me briefly about wh at happened  to your uncle, 
Joseph Schtiglietz
(ph) who 
went on to 
Palestine
. 
A: He went to 
Palestine
 and he opened a gallery, like 
he did be Œ like he had before 
the war. He did extremely well, and the galle
ry was just closed about two years ago, 
when  he died. But he 
lived there, and he was definitely
 a Zionist, was a da Œ Zionist 
before the war. He was very happy to be in 
Israel
, traveled very often to 
Europe
 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

198
and bought and sold  and Œ a
nd so on. And died  a well t Œ 
very well-to -do man. So he 
did very well. And his children Œ his daugh
t Œ he has two daughters and a son. His 
wife died a few years before him, a
nd they™re Œ and the children all live in 
Israel
, all 
three of them, and they™re married and ha
ve ch ildren an d so on, and I™m in touch 
with them. 

Q: Was it very hard fo r you wh en he died, 
because you said you had such an intense 
connection to him when  you were younger? 
A: It was very hard, because he was also 
very sick for a long time before he died, 
and he was in a senior c
itizen situ ation in Œ in 
Ba t Ya m
, and I visit Œ I went all the 
time when I was there, went all the time.
 But it was very Œ it was heartbreaking 

because he Œ it was hard to also figure out
, you know, exactly wh
at he had, because 
Œ it was probably a number of strokes, because in 
Israel
 I find they don™t Œ it™s not 
like in 
America
, in 
America
 people are very blunt, a
nd the doctors tell the patient 
an-and you know exactly wh
at, more or less, what th
e story is. Over there my 
cousins would say, well, you know, old ag
e and so on. And it bothered me a lot 
because I couldn™t get to the bottom of it, but
 he Œ he had Œ he was sick for a year, 
very sick and Œ and 
Œ and then  he died.

Q: I was just thinking, he had su ch a 
profound effect on you and a profound 
influence on you as a child
, but his lo Œ his an Œ his death mu st have been a 
tremendous loss for you. 
A: Yeah, it was, it was both for me and for my
 brother. We ta Œ often talked about it, 
about that, yeah. And 
when  we went to 
Israel
, one of my  main reason Œ we have a 
home in 
Israel
, and Œ and we did that when  our ch
ildren were Œ were ha Œ our older 
daughter was about 10 when  we built the ho
me. So we did that when they were 
young, and the reason was, act
ually, that we wanted th em
 to speak Hebrew well, and 
not Œ you know, spoken Hebrew, and get to
 know the country , and my  husband was 
always interested in hi Œ zi Œ he Œ he is a 
Zionist, always supporte
d the state. He also 
has an office in 
Israel
, he also was business-wise active. But the main reason why I 
supported the whole thing was because of 
my uncle. I mean, otherwise, I wouldn™t 
have wanted  to have a house there, and so 
on. But Œ so  we saw a lot of him when  we 
were there, all the time. 

Q: Do you also speak Hebrew? 
A: I speak some Hebrew, yes. I learned it 
wh en I was Œ you know, I go there quite Œ 
we still go twice a year, all the time. And 
I Œ I don™t speak terribly well, because Œ 
my  husband speaks fluently and very, ve
ry well. But I just went to an old 
[indecipherable]
 in 
New Yo rk
, and I found out exactly, the same as with my  other

education, I learn languages by hearing, 
very  easily. But because I never had an y 
kind of Jewish education 
[indeciphera b le]
. So I didn™t Œ the Œ the class at the 
[indecipherable] 
was composed  mo stly of women wh
o knew how to read very well, 
and knew how to  pray, but couldn™t put a se
ntence together, and I could speak very 

well, but I couldn™t read. So Œ and then 
th ey would sit there and start, you know 
doing th e 
diktuk
(ph) and Œ and so on, 
and I dropped out, because that™s not what I 
was Œ I was interested in learning how to 
speak well, and Œ and so I learned it by be 
Œ first in the 
[indecipherable]
 basic things, then I had so
me private lessons and I go 
t Œ go to  
Israel
 all the time, so I understand we
ll, and I speak well Œ well enough, 
but I don™t read it, and tha Œ it™s a s
uperficial kind of thing, but I don Œ 
Q: Speaking of 
Israel
, what was your reaction at the time of the 
Eichmann
 trial? Do 
you remember anything special? 
A: I remember the 
Eichmann 
trial, I was terribly happy th
at they caught him, and I 
thought it was a great trial, and was a great thing for 
Israel
 and I was all in favor of 
it. I can™t say that I 
felt the same w ay when 
Demja n juk
 was tried, and subsequent, 
you know, that kind of thi
ng. Because again, you Œ it™s 
like with a very, you know, 
successful event, it™s hard to repeat it.
 And sometimes it™s counterproductive. 
Q: Did it stir memories, the 
Eichmann
 trial, for you? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
201
A: A little bit, because 
Eichmann
 was in 
Hungary
, I don™t know if you realize. He 
was the one that Œ and th ere were Œ th
at™s why the deportations from Œ from 
Hungary
 were so efficiently done
, because he came there a
nd he did it very quick ly 
and efficiently. So  I kept hearing the name 
Eichmann
. So it didn™t stir memo ry Œ 
well, you know, I th Œ I was afraid  it di
dn™t Œ th at we wo uld be deported, we 
weren™t. So, after the war, when he was cau
ght, I was just glad that he was caught, 
and I thought it was a very 
worthwhile trial, both for 
Israel
 and for the world. That Œ 
that one trial I thought was great, but I don
™t like when they try these people who are 
now in th eir 80s, and you know, like in 
France
 when they tried Œ who was it that 
they were trying, was so old, and it™s Œ 
it doesn™t Œ I don™t think it makes sense to 
put Œ to Œ fo r that kind of thing to Œ to 
be tried so many years later. You don™t have 
the witnesses, you don™t have anything. 
Q: Do you have any special 
attachments to the civil rights movement here in the 

United States
, again, because of your experience? 
A: I™m not a very political person, wa Œ the 
only thing Œ no, not th
e civil rights, no, I 
Œ  
Q: A sensitivity, in a Œ wa Œ do you feel
 you have a greate
r sensitivity to it? 
A: Yes, I would say sensitivity, yes. When
 I read about what
 does happen, or 
doesn ™t happen, especially now in 
New York
, we have all these incidents with Œ 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss  
 
March 1, 1999 
 

 
 
202
because of the police seems to
 overreact because of our present administratio n, I get 
Œ I read all of that and it upsets me. The othe
r sensitivity that I have is that I became 
aware of an organization called the 
Abraham
 Fu nd  in  
New York
, which is an 
organization that tries to promote bette
r understanding and 
Œ and coexistence 
basically, between Israeli Jews an d Arabs, in Œ in 
Israel
 within th e Green Line and 
I™m very active with that, because I thi
nk that, you know, having, like my husband 
said, having been a second cl
ass citizen in a country like 
Poland
, one knows what it 
feels like to be an Arab in 
Israel
, with the same problems of
 having an identity card, 
where you™re Œ you know, the religion is st
amped in and that sort of thing. So, 
because of that, I do have more of a sens
itivity about that. But 
mainly in connection 
with 
Israel
, not so much with 
America
, because in 
America
, it™s a problem that I™m 
not familiar enough with, or knowledgeable
 enough where I think,
 you know, that I 
can actively make an enormous diffe
rence. So I just read about it. 

Q: You had said earlier that you are Œ you 
don™t read other Holocaust memo irs, but 
you read historical books, is that correct? 

A: Historical books? Not so mu ch  historic
al as when there™s 
something worthwhile, 
from a different point of view. For instance
, I found that f Œ I don™t remember w h at 
the name of it was, a book that somebody 
recommended to me just last year, about 
women. It was called, between courage an
d something else. Not a very good title, I

thought. A woman who is, I th
ink a sociologi Œ a professor of sociology, wh atever, 
and who wrote about wo men in 
Germany
, ger Œ the Jewish wo men in 
Germany
, 
between 1933 and ™39. It wasn™t even ab
out the war. And I found Œ that kind of 
thing I find very interesting because it Œ 
it talked about how th
e structure of the 
family changed, as the men were losing th
eir positions and were not allowed to  wo  Œ 
to execute, let™s say, doctors were not allo wed to practice, you know, as the racial 

laws progressed in 
Germany
. Before the war, women 
tended to sometimes earn a 
living, sometimes the men became so is
olated and so discouraged  and so 
demoralized that the women were the f Œ th
-the force behind th e 
family. Also, when 
they had the discrimin atory laws against 
children in schools, it was the women who 
went to the schools, and Œ 
and Œ and were in touch w
ith the children, and heard 
about all of that. Also, when
 the husband was arrested, w h
ich happen ed very often at 
that point, or had some running in with 
the police, it was the women who went in 
and tried to Œ to talk to the police and trie
d to help the husbands. It totally changed 
the structure of the family. The women becam
e the Œ the stronger part of the family, 
very often in Œ in a way that would not have
 happened  at all, had it not been a Œ in a 
Œ a Œ had this not happened. And I find that 
kind of thing interests me very mu ch . It 
Œ It™s partly, you know, Germ
an anti-Semitism, Holocaust, 
but it™s not just a story of 
what somebody went through,
 but how it affected life and 
affected the families, and

affected every-everything; how it changed 
th ings; how it showed Œ I Œ I Œ I also 
noticed that in my own fa
mily, that my mother was 
the much more, somehow, 
resourceful person during the 
war than my  father, who had a tremendous position 
before the war. But once all of this was 
taken away from him, he Œ it Œ and I, of 
course, as a child I never un
derstood what was going on. Th
at kind of thing in terests 
me, that kind of thing I r
ead. There was recently a bo
ok by a German man written, 
called 
ﬁThe Reader,ﬂ
 did you read that? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I find Œ that I find also very interesti
ng; motivation, why and so  on. Little Œ in 
order to Œ I read about the Ho
locaust only things that I Œ 
books that I think will give 
me more in sight. That Œ that™s the only re
ason why I read them. Otherwise I really 

am not interested.  

Q: Are there any sights or sounds today that
 make you th ink back, or odors, smells, 
or even getting on a train? Do
es any of this ever trigger thoughts of the war? 
A: Not odor and not smell and not trains. 
What does trigger is mu sic, I would say. 
And not some lofty music, but let™s say if 
I h ear someplace, in an old, whatever, 
ﬁLili Marlene.ﬂ
 That triggers it. But Œ or the ot
her day I saw, gee, a wonderful film, 
which I think is going to be
 released, called comede Œ 
ﬁComedian
(ph) 
Harm onicum
(ph)
.ﬂ
 Did you hear about it? 

 
Interview with Riane Gruss

Q: Yeah. 
A: And that kind of music then triggers, but
 not, no, not trains and not Œ trains are so 
different now, you know, what 
Œ what Œ I mean, if you take 
Amtrak 
from Œ it™s Œ 
Q: Well, I meant because you were
 what, six weeks on a train. 
A: Yeah, I know, no Œ yeah, 
but wa Œ the train itself is so different that it doesn™t 
trigger that, no, mm-mm, no, no. 

Q: What about lots of sn ow? 
A: Snow, that™s a good question, I l Œ st Œ I 
love it. I think it™s beautiful when it falls. 
In 
New York 
there was Œ
 
when  we had that Œ what was it, the storm Œ not storm, 
what did they call it? The bli
zzard, a few years ago, I at Œ and I went to the park, I 
sort of said to myself, here we have Œ wh
at did we get, say 12 inches, 16 inches, I 
don™t know. And I rememb er Œ and I said to
 myself, this is l
ovely, but, you know, 
it™s really not terribly much
; they make such a fuss ove
r it. But what we had in 
Siberia
, the snow falls and it di Œ never, ever 
melt s. An d I reme mb
er when we were 
going to  this school there, there was like a 
little Œ it was like a 
corridor and on both 
sides the snow came up to practically my 
Œ to my shoulders, I Œ just my little head 
was out there. So Œ and it was like that fo
r months and months. So, yes, I did think 
about that for a moment, but ju
st as a joke, rather than Œ you know, it doesn™t trigger 
anything horrible.

Q: Is there anything else that you wanted 
to  say, or anything we haven™t covered? 
Anything Œ any maybe messages t o  your gr
andchildren? Anything you™d like to say 
before we close? 
A: Messages to my  grandchildren. I hope 
it never happen s to th
em. No. I hope they 
have good lives, and then y
ou know, will Œ will just see th
is as an interesting thing 
that happened to one of their gr
andparents. No, nothing sp ecial. 
Q: Well, thank you very mu
ch fo r doing th e interview. 
A: You™re very welcome. You™re very we
lcome, I hope it, you know, it™s of interest 
to somebody at some time. My grandson t
oday asked me about this, my  eight year 
old, why are you doing this? Why are you telling 
Ga il
 about this? So I said to her Œ I 
said to him, it™s going to  go
 to the museum, the Holocaus
t Museum. And he Œ and he 
said why? And I said, well, you know, ma
ybe someday somebody is going to study 
about what ha
ppened in 
Europe 
at that time, and maybe 
they™ll look for somebody 
who was not very old, or wa
s still a child and was in 
Hungary
. And they™ll look up 
in the index and they™ll look up 
Hungary
, and there™ll be one other story, it will be 
different from what Hungarian childrenwent through, becau
se I™m Œ wasn™t 
Hungarian, I Œ and ho Œ he said oh. That wa
s the end of that. So, I tried to explain to 
him wa Œ wh at this is good for. So  I hope
 in that sense that, you know, it™s good for 
that.
