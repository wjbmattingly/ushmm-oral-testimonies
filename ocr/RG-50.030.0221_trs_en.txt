Q: Would you tell me  your name  please? 
 

A:  My name  is Pela Starkopf. 

 

Q: Where and when were you born? 

 

A:  I was born Warsaw, Poland, 1914, Nove mber 18th. 

 

A:  My name  is Ada m Starkopf. I was born in Poland in April 1st, 1914. I lived in Wa rsaw. 

 

Q: Pela, tell me  some thing about your pa
rents and your childhood, your growing up. 
 

A (Pela):  I had a wonderful childhood. I...m
y parents uh...we...I had one brother who's 
three and a half years younger th
an me , with a very loving fam
ily. We  were very well off. 
We had...I had...I was going to private school
s since I was a baby uh five years old and 

uh I graduated gramma r school, private gr
amma r  school, later high school and then 
college in Warsaw and uh we were a very ha
ppy...I had a nice big family. My mother had 
a couple sisters and two brothers. They alwa
ys...family was together. I reme mber before 

every holiday we used to spend with our gr
andparents and it was just a wonderful life and 
I mi ss it terribly. 
 

Q: Tell me  about uh the school you went to. 
 
A (Pela): I went to uh school in Chi...in Wa rsaw
 and this was a private high school and from 
there uh I graduated and I have some  girlfrie
nds here in the United States with whom I 
graduated school together, and uh the life was 
was wonderful. What can I tell you?  I had 

a wonderful brother. We  loved each ot her 
and uh the war broke...took everything away 
from... 
 

Q: Where did you grow up Ada m?  

 

A (Ada m) :  I grew up also in Wa rsaw, Poland. I 
went to private school 
also in Wa rsaw. After 
graduate, I attended University of Warsaw a
nd uh I had one brother only who left Poland 
in 1933 for Palestine. 
 

Q: Tell me the circumstances of all that, will you? 

 

A (Ada m) :  Alright. My brother was always 
dreaming about Palestine. He  was really a 
Zionist, you know...very ardent Zi onist and bei
ng that the British wouldn't give them...he 
wanted to immigrate to Palestine but the 
British, you know, governme nt at that time  
wouldn't give them any entry visas, so
 they organized...the Warsaw ______...he was 
commander (ph) of the Warsaw ______...they or
dered....organized a trip, a motorcycle 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
2 
 
trip which they called Tel Aviv...uh Warsaw...I
'm sorry...Warsaw, Tel Aviv, Wa rsaw. In 
other words, every one of them supposed to co
me back, but they all remained in Palestine 
that time...those days, went underground and they
 remained until the day when of course 
Israel was born. He...the trip 
took them about three months, so
 I had one brother. He died 
in 1965. He got a heart attack....supposed to 
come  and visit us and unfortunately had a 
heart attack, died in Tel Aviv in 1965. And 
my parents...the same  thing. We we had a 
wonderful family and uh quite a large fa mily
 as far as...including uncles and aunts and 
cousins and so on. Unfortunately everyone of 
them was perished...perished in Treblinka. 
My mother especially wa s kind of a Jewis
h...we say that our daught
er has her character, 
not even mi ne and Pela's. My mothe r  was lik
e a walking angel, walking, and she really 

had a wonderful character and unfortunately 
she died during the bombing of Wa rsaw a nd 
this is anothe r stor y which probably Pela can 
describe because she died in her arms, and I 

was that time away because I 
had to leave Poland, uh Wa rsaw
 for the eastern part of 
Poland to be get, to be mobilized when the war broke out. 
 

Q: Let's, let's hold it a mi nute. Uh you two have 
a have a love story that goes from befor e  the 
war. Uh how did you meet? 
 

A (Ada m) :  OK. (Laughter) I was thirteen year
s old and she wa s twelve, and I walked down 
the street because we lived in the same  
neighborhood, and I walked down the street with 
a friend of mi ne and in our schools, in privat
e schools, we used to have not uniforms in 
our school but these caps, you know, the same , you know, hats and school...each school 

had different hats and I saw he
r very often on the street with
 her briefcase with books and 
when I was a thirteen years old boy...can you imagine I said to my friend...do you see this 

blond girl across the street. He said yes. 
I'm going some day to ma rry her. (Laughter) 

That's at the age of thirteen–And then one
 day she was...I saw her uh on one of the 
streets in front of a library, and I walk over 
to her and I said, excuse me , could I keep you 
company?  She said not now. I'm waiting for my boyfriend. She said we have to send 
some  books in the library. Anyway, to ma ke 
the story shor t, we became acquainted and 
from then on, we used to go out steady and we
 uh...it seems to me that that's, that's was 
our destiny (Laughter) and, you know, we just tied
 (ph) to each other,
 and Pela and I...and 
we decided that in 1936 we were ma rried, thr
ee years before the war. This May 31st will 
be fifty-four years we are together, and we 
are just like one, and dur
ing the war I think we 
proved to each other that one for the other 
would be...you know...it's life 
in order to spare 
and save the other one. She would give her life
 to save me . I would give my life to save 
her, and both of us would give our lives to
 save the child. And that's  the...we were 
fighting for it very, very strong. 
 

Q: Pela, tell me  about the first few years of 
marriage, in the late '30's and from Warsaw. 
 

A (Pela):  We ...we had our apartment but Iwas going to school, so I didn't do any cooking. 
We ate with our parent s, but in 1938, his 
mother became very lonely. She was very 
lonesome  for her son, but she couldn't go to 
Palestine for a visit because we  had...he had 
a grandfather who had an amputated leg uh ma
ny years before and he needed attention. 
We had a maid in the house, but she couldn'
t leave the father...she wouldn't leave the 
house because his father traveled a lot, so so
mebody had to stay in the house, live in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

house when she was away, so we decided to gi
ve up our apartment, put our furniture in 
storage, and move in with 
his uh his parents in 1938. And 
in 1939 she came back and the 
war broke out. So we were all together dur
ing the beginning of the war, bombing of 
Warsaw and all this. I loved he
r very much. I loved her. Sh
e  w a s . . . my  mo t h e r  s o me t i me s  
said I think you love uh Moth
er Starkopf more than me . 
I said Mother, no. You I...you 
know that I love you. Her...I just really ador
ed her. She was just...just...I never me t a 
human being...she...and this comes from a daughte
r-in-law. When I hear that some  people 
say oh my mother-in-law...that that's  not fair. 
 
Q: Tell me  about those first few years that...t
he first year or so and the bombing?  What 
happened when the bombs began to fall? 
 

A (Pela):  The war broke out...broke out uh September the 1st. The bombing in the 
beginning wa sn't  as bad. Uh we...a couple of times he was going to...he was called into 

to, to dig some  ditches but th
e last couple days after the 6
th
 of September started so that 
was absolutely no day and no night. We were in the cellar where we used to keep 

potatoes or, or uh coal for, for uh hea
ting the stove, and there we...the whole 
building...everybody was there with their cots 
and their pillows and blankets so the 
children who stayed there, becau
se it was absolutely impossibl
e to be in the apartment. 
And this was uh time of our
 holidays...September 16th...and his mother was uh...it, it 
started very heavy bombing but was around four
 o'clock and the bombing let off a little 
bit, so she said let's go upstairs and we  w
ill eat some thing. So we went upstairs. She 
started to prepare a 
little supper for my hus...my  fath
er-in-law, me ...Ada m was already 
away...and my parents were with us because
 their apartment was bombed completely. 
They couldn't  live there any more, and she 
was serving that. She said I don't feel good 
and my mother was helping. She said I 
don't know...Ada m...Pela...and that's it and she 
fainted. My mother...we couldn't...in that time 
on the street in Warsaw you couldn't walk. 
There was a curfew. After seven o'cloc k was 
no way. You couldn't be on the street. When 
a German would...will see you on the street, you 
could be shot . But we had to have a 
doctor in our building. Was no 
doctor, so she we nt out and two houses away she knew a 
physician. She uh run to him and begged him to
 come  and to see what he can help my 
mother-in-law, and he he didn't want to come . He was afraid. She kissed his hands. She 

begged him at his knees...please come. And he
 came . And he looke
d out...was quiet on 
the street. Our door, our gate was open uh 
from our building. He run in. He came  
upstairs. Her blood pressure was 320. She 
was gone. Nothing could be done. So she 

really died with the with the name  of 
her son...what I found out later that some  ma n, 
young ma n, who went out the same  time Ada m we
nt out, on the way the bombing was so 
bad that some of them ca me  back. When they
 came  back one  of them sai d that everybody 

who walked out, who came out, is probably dead, and I think that Adam is dead...dead 

too. And she overheard it and that was why I 
think this was...because she said Adam, and 
she talked to my father-in-law. Adam...if 
Ada m...if some thing happened to Ada m, I don't 
want to live. And that's  what, what 
happened. He was _____ away. He didn't know 
nothing about it. 
 

Q: Tell us about... 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

A (Ada m) :  This was a stroke. Now, you see, 
when they announced that all able-bodied, you 
know, military-aged uh me n should uh proceed 
into their recruiting stations for 
mobilization, I went several times butthe Polish governme nt...it was...the  war...you 
know, Ger many at that point, you know....it wa
s a tremendous surprise. They were not 

prepared for it. So they didn't even have enough uniforms and arms for the people for 

____, you know, so they couldn't even...the
y couldn't mobilize anybody. But later on 

came on the 6th of September of 1939, the ma
yor of the city of Wa rsaw announced at 
night over the radio that 
all young people should leave Wa rsaw and proceed into uh 
towards the eastern part of Poland where they
 would be mobilized. And the city to which 
we had to go was about hundred and twenty miles away from Wa rsaw, _____. You 

know, just to walk ____, so we, without a
nything...without any transportation. We  had 
meetings with our neighbors and uh with ot
her friends in the building and finally we 
decided that I...that all the 
young people should go and I together with a few other young 

me n left Wa rsaw. My father I reme mber now to
ok me  to his bedroom just to give me a 
few words of advice and he broke down a
nd sobbed...sobbing and then I left. She, Pela, 
and my mother, in her hous
e...in their house _____ robes...i
t was five o'clock in the 
morning...walked with me  towards the bridge ov
er the _____ River. This was a suburb in 
Prague...a suburb of Wa rsaw where we parte
d. At that time uh they left...Pela...I...Pela 
was sobbing. Pela was crying. My mother forced
 herself not to cry and even gave me  a 
smile, and I looked back at them. My mother
 was very, you know, slowly leading Pela 
away and I was running away from them a
nd this was the last time I saw my mother. 
Anyway, then I, together with another group...s
ome of them ca me  back because there wa s 
constant bombing as we walked, you know, towa
rds that particular city. I was wounded. I 
was operated in the meantime, you know...but to ma ke the story very short, that on the 

16th of September I was in one of the borde
r cities in eastern Po
land, and over there was 
very quiet. We didn't hear any German planes
. In fact people don't 
see m like they would 
know that the war was going on, and uh we we
re all...you can imagine after hundred and 
twenty miles of uh walking, we were all...my, 
my shoes my shoes were torn, my clothes 
and I was filthy and dirty and some body put us up
 in a barn overnight to sleep and in the 
morning at five o'clock we heard some  sound 
of tanks. We  ran out in front of the barn 
and those we re Russian tanks that we re rolling 
into that  part icular town. We just that  time 
found out that Germany and Soviet Russia si
gned a non-aggression pact and they divided 
Poland. There were at that time  as allies
, both of Russia and P
o...and Germany and they 
divided Poland. The Ger...Germa
ny occupied the western part
 of Poland, Soviet Russia 
the eastern part of Poland. So
 I found myself in the eastern part of Poland under Russian 
occupation and my dream then was only one 
dream...to go back to Wa rsaw, go back to 
my fa mily to be with them. And I smuggle
...I wrote about the ____ 
in book that I told 
you about, but I some how s muggled myself th
rough toward...I me t a peasant, a Polish 
peasant. I gave him my wristwatch that I 
still had with me  a nd he smuggled me  through 

in a rowboat to the, the river that was divi
ding the, the, the, you know, the Russian zone 
and German zone, and I went back to Wa
rsaw. I came back and that time I found out 
about the death of my mother. And uh the
n, of course, in 19...we, we somehow...the, the 
war was still on. Wa rsaw was already...on 
the western front...Warsaw already was 
surrounded...was under German occ upation a
nd in 1940 in October they began to uh 
work on the Warsaw ghetto, build the walls...abou
t between eight and ten foot walls with 
barbed wires on top of the walls in Wars
aw...broken glass, uh pieces of glass cemented 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

on top of the brick walls. And during...in, in ghe
tto of course, to describe it it's a long 
story about it...if you want me  to... 
 
Q: How...what was it like inside
 the ghetto?  How did you, the tw
o of you, get into the ghetto 
and what was it like? 
 

A (Ada m) :  We , we happened...we were lucky th
at our apartment was still in the in the 
section of Warsaw that the...that was in th
e ghetto because they extended the, the...when 
they take over the neighborhood for Jewish, you know, mi xed neighborhoods and then 

they brought in people from differe
nt streets, different areas, 
and even different, different 
cities into the Warsaw ghetto which they 
built. The Wa rsaw ghetto approximately they 
estimate was built into on an area of about
 one...one thou...I think uh one thousand, you 
know...that's not important to you the size. The fa
ct is that we had gates which were uh 
guarded by the Gestapo with Polish police,
 you know, assisting them. We found ourself 
in our apartment, which was as I told you, in Warsaw ghetto and we were living from 

selling our own possession to some  peopl
e because, you know, there were no way...we 
couldn't support ourselves, so whatever those 
of us...there's  a black ma rket. There were 
some  people operating, were buying certain thin
gs and selling on the other side of the 
ghetto, and I myself being that
 I looked very Ary...typically
 Ar yan...I was blond and slim 
and when I was young...and I...we had an ordina
nce incidentally in the Warsaw ghetto 
that everyone of us had to wear white armba
nds with a blue Star of David. What I was 
doing, I was getting out of the Wa rsaw ghetto th
ough some  special places
 in the wall that 
we had all to walk through the cemetery 
which was outside of the Wa rsaw ghetto. I 
would smuggle out myself and I took, used to
 take off the uh white, the armband, and as 
a Po...as Pole, I had some connections on the other 
side. I used to get a 
little bit of butter, 
a little bit of, you know, milk...I used to smuggle in into uh back into Wa rsaw into the 
Warsaw ghetto to help the fa mily and then in 1941, in 1941, January 14th, our child was 
born. Our daughter was born. And... 
 

Q: Tell me  __________. Tell us tell us the story lead
ing up to the birth of that child, indeed. 
 

A (Pela):  Now I...when I became ill, the doctor 
told that I...I thought that I...I was running 
fever, some thing is wrong with me . He tell
s me  to go take an x-ray and asked me  to 
______.  

I don't worry about it. I cannot have any child
ren. I was told that I cannot have any 
children, but when I went to the doctor she su
rprised me  and she tells me  I'm pregnant. 
Of course, I...I was bewildered and I thought th
at ma ybe to do away with this child, but 
my mother was with me  and she said, don't 
darling do to it. Every huma n life has their 
destiny and you never know. Please don't. I lis
tened to her, and the child was born in 
terrible conditions because I didn't enough money to have a doctor so a mi dwife 

delivered the baby. The next day she had to se
w me  up. It wa s in terrible conditions. But 
we were very happy. It was a beautiful little gi
rl, healthy little girl
. One day my father uh 
was supposed to come  around ten o'clock. He didn't  come . You know
, ma ybe an hour and 

a half later, holding his hand with handkerc
hief near his mouth. I said, Daddy, what's  
happened?  He went to the dentist. He  had a c
ouple gold teeth, so he let him pull his gold 
teeth and to sell it to buy milk for th
e baby. Where my daught er was born uh you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
6 
 
we put her in a pillowcase and we had a we 
had a belt and we crossed it that way it was. 
But the child was growing. She was a very he
althy little gi rl. We  were selling our–what 
we had, our belongings, our, our...w
hat, what was left yet, and uh when he was arrested, 
my daughter was that time  al most a year old. 
When he went out and 
tried to get a little 
more, you know food for us and we waited for 
him. He didn't  come , and we were sure 
that he was killed, that some thing happene
d. We  were all, all crying and it was around 
eleven o'clock at night...we
 heard we heard steps. We  

were living on the tenth floor
. We  had steps and I recognized his steps. I told my 
grand...my father-n-law, Dad, look...there is...A
dam is comi ng. We  opened the door. He  
came in and behind him was a policeman and he will tell you the stor y how... 
 

Answer (Adam) : Now, you see, again on one of
 my trips when I was going over, you know, on 
the other side of Wa rsaw ghetto...I was caught
 without my...without th
e armband near the 
wall, near the wall by a Gesta
po, by SS ma n. They arrested me , 
of course, and took me  to 
the headquarters of the Gestapo in Warsaw wh
ich was outside of the Warsaw ghetto, in 
the Polish sectioned area...in the Polish sect
ion. And uh they were very rude and uh, of 
course, after interrogation they
 took me  to a room which wa s about eight by eight and the 

walls were full of fresh blood, red wa lls, a
nd then they have uh wooden benches on the 

floor and into on top was broken pieces of gl
ass ceme nted into these benches and they, 
they used to force you to undress and beat you 
to death on those pieces of broken glass. 
He said to me , you're going to undress and 
lay down on this. I said oh no. I knew...why 

should I...I have no chance...you know I didn'
t have any chance. I had no ar...no guns. I 
couldn't help myself, but I said no, I will not und
ress. If you want you try. I felt that if he 
would try to undress me , I would start, you know, 
hit him and then he will just kill me  at 
once and that's it, but uh I didn't and he said
 to me, OK. We  j ust wanted to scare you. 
Tomorrow we finish you. They took me  to th
e...again to another ma n, to Gestapo ma n. 
Finally they decided that they are taking me 
to the Polish police. The Polish police stat ion 

was in ghetto, and that's  how, you know, when 
they were...the, the gen...the Gestapo man 
that was taking me  to get into ghetto to th
e Pol...Polish police station, he wa s more...he 
seemed to me like a human being, you know, 
norma l huma n being. And he said I know 
what you are thinking of, he said to me . Y
ou would like to escape now. And I would let 
you but if I will let you, I will be in jail and my
 family will be destroyed. He said I cannot 
do that. So he took me  to the police station a
nd that time  I asked the policeman that he 
should do me a favor before he leads me  to 
the prison in ghetto. He should stop to see my 
fa mily, and that's  what Pela told you that I 
stopped and from there, so he let me  kiss my 
Pela, let kiss the, the baby and my father a
nd we went and they took me  to uh prison, uh 
military prison in Warsaw ghetto. In those days, of course, in prison there were no 

criminals. Anyone that was a Jew...doctors, 
professors, and uh professional people, 
business people, you know...anyone that was a Jew was in prison at that time, and I was 

in prison about eight, eight 
weeks that time  and thanks to Pela's intervention, they 
released me  because Pela ma de...she me t thr
ough some one a nd told this policeman that 
one of the policemen from the station gave 
her a name  of a police officer who was of 
German des cent, so called ____ deutcsh (p
h) that she could, you know, some how get me  
out. And we had a very beautiful bedroom 
set that was stored by some  people uh you 
know, away like Polish people, and Pe la ma de a deal with him and she gave him the 

bedroom set and he got me out from jail. But 
it di dn't last too long because they realized 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
7 
 
that he just, you know, uh put the...what he 
did actually he took the papers, you know, 
with my na me and put them some where else 
in a different pl ace I think underneath files 
or in a file and they finally...you know, they cam
e to it and noticed that I am that I was 
mi ssing. They came at night and took me  away
 again. They took me  away and this wa s 
already the second time when I was in prison an
d again it's  a very long story to tell about 
the interrogations, what they'r e doing, were doi
ng in the prisons, but I can tell you only 
that it was terribl e. They were, for example, in
 some  of the cells they were opening at fi ve 
o'clock in the morning the door and the Ge
rman uh SS me n with thetrained German 
Shepherds would point at you, for example, or
 at this ma n and on a certain word, Juda 
(ph), which means Jew i n German, he would 
jump at you and tore you apart, the German 
Shepherd. And they were just going from ev
ery second cell, not every one cell. In our 
cell was twenty-six people. Four of them 
were destroyed this 
way. It's a miracl e I 
survived. They didn't...and when they taking ou
t four people to kill, then they supplement 
another four they brought in, so there's alwa
ys twenty-six me n in a cell, and then, of 

course, I learned over ther
e about the liquida...about th
e beginning and the _____ I found 
out what they decided, you know that they liqui
date the, the, the Jewish people and about 
the liquidation of Wa rsaw ghetto. 
 

Q: How did you find out? 

 

A (Ada m) :  The work...I found out through some...in, in...you know...they, they came to us, 
to some  people in the prison, that Wa rsaw
 ghetto is going to be liquidated and the 

beginning wa s...of the liquidation would be July 22nd, 1942. And how the Germans...you 

know, they always do everything with treme
ndous precision, so how how could they 
liquidate the easiest way. They surrounded 
first...in the beginning of July, they 
surrounded the orphanage s, old age ho me s, hospitals, and prisons, because this was the 
the best , the easiest  access to get the people for the unschlagplatz (ph) which the railroad 
tracks where they were pr epared the cattle cars for Treblinka, so let's say they surrounded 

the pri...the hospitals. From th
e hospital anyone that was in re
latively in good health was 
taken to the...was taken to Treblinka concen
tration camp or as I cal
l it destruction camp. 
Anyone in in, you know, that was either weak or
, or old, they were 
taken to the Jewish 
cemetery and at the edge of the ma ss grave, 
were executed then. The same thing was in 
orphanages. They took all the 
children to the Jewish cemeter
y and front of the ma ss grave 
and executed them. People in less than good 
health and older people, everybody to the 
Jewish cemetery and that's where they execu
ted them. I some how knew one thing only. I 

was dreaming all the time when I was in pr
ison that some thing I had to do...something 
has to be done to save my fa mily and during...when they surrounded the prison and 

tremendous chaos was created at that time. 
There were trucks, you know. So ma ny trucks 
and so ma ny people. The gates were opene
d. They were taking hundreds and hundreds of 
prisoners into Treblinka. I was able to es
cape with a few other me n. Escape through the 
gate, and I came  home , r a n home. Of course
, you can imagine how Pela and my father 
and my in-laws were surprised and shocked 
when they saw me , and I came and I we nt 
out...I already had this in advance in mi nd, to 
work out a plan how to save our child. This 
was our ma i n object, how to save the child 
and being that the Jewish ceme tery was 

outside of the Wa rsaw ghetto, we worked out a 
plan together with Pela that we would put 
the child to sleep with that friend of ours w
ho put her to sleep, gave her an injection, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

we arrange a funeral for this child in order 
to get her out of the ghetto. In the meanti me, 
through some underground connections that I 
had, I worked out false documents for us, 
and that under assume d name s, like my na me  wa s Ada m Bludosky (ph) instead of 
Starkoph. Pela was ____ Bludosky and Joanne
 was Yasha Bludosky and worked out 
there was, you know, the forged papers and we
 uh on this funeral, me n were not allowed 
to follow it. Pela would follow this, this f
uneral. In fact when the German book which I 
showed to you before, you know, showed the pict
ure of the entrance to the funeral and 
the casket in which she was carried out, and th
e register shows Pela...w
hen Pela will take 
over, and she will tell you, she...how she came out with the child through the cemetery 

and then in the evening how I me t them. Pela, I think ma ybe you... 
 

Answer (Pela): Adam didn't me ntion that when 
he came from jail, from this prison when he 
escaped, he didn't sleep home anymore because
 he was afraid that ma ybe they would 
catch him, s o he slept by, by neighbors, by fr
iends and uh got in touch with these friends 
of ours who were on the other side and got
 the false papers. My fa mily was very 
bewildered. My mother and father couldn't 
believe that we are going to take this 

child...we didn't have to watch...what are you 
going to do. This is insane. But I said 
Mother, I have to...I have to do it. We'll come
 to, to take you some day ba ck. We  also find 
a place for you, but I have  to save the child. Being in ghetto, rema ining in ghetto, Yasha 

will be murdered, so I have to take a chance. We 'll not go over  that  all three of us, but I 

have to take a chance, so when the uh ev
erything was arranged to pick her up, uh one, 
one thirty, because we knew that we have to 
be at the at the cemetery gate a quarter to 
two. Every two hours another SS ma n had a post n
ear the gate. We gave some money to a 
Polish policeman whom I knew, and he gave
 something to the German to let me go 
through and see my child buried and he said OK,
 but she will right 
away come  back. He 
said of course she will right away come  b
ack. So at a quarter of  two I went through the 
gate. But he stopped me . He said let me  see what
 is that and he wanted to take his hand 
open the white ____ what I had over there c
overed my daughter. I said she died of 
typhoid. Wh en he heard those words he turned 
away. He said alright, but you are going to 

be fifteen mi nutes back.  I said of course I wi
ll be. But I knew that in fifteen mi nutes he is 

getting off his post and some body else...he woul
d not tell anybody else that he let in 
some body t o the cemetery and I...when the, the when they came  the hearse came  to the 

cemetery, the workers wanted to pi ck up the 
baby and throw her in the mass grave. I 

started to scream. I said don't touch her. She'
s alive. They couldn't believe...their eyes 
were open...their mouth open. And I took her ou
t. I had with me  under my arm I had a 
bottle with milk and I took her to the place wher
e they used to wash the bodies before the 
war. In there I kept her. She was a little b
it yet sleepy and a little b
it...she woke up a little 
bit so I gave her the bottle, but she wa s ver
y, very quiet and this was July 21st, 1942. And 
uh around eight thirty, nine o'clock was dark...sta
rted to be dark and I me t up with Adam 
that through a hole in the wall in the Wars
aw ghetto there they took some  uh the uh 
bricks away and he would come , and he cam
e. It was around nine o'clock, knew where I 
was waiting, and he uh me t up with some body 
next to the Jewish cemetery, were two 
cemeteries. One was a Catholic cemetery and 
one was a potter's (ph) ceme t ery what wa s 
almost not in use, but there was a caretaker 
and he was working with the with the Jewish 
boys, some times let through a little smuggle and he was he was...if you paid him off a 

little bit he was very coopera
tive with us, and without th
e smuggling into the Wa rsaw

ghetto, people would die like flies because that
 what the German gave us  was not enough. 
People had to live on the rations, you will found them were on the street in the morning 
with swollen stomachs and swollen eyes...i
t was, was not enough, so when he, Adam 
took a a big stone and knoc
ked at the wall to the po
tter's cemet ery and the ma n 
came...with with another stone that he heard us
 and he put down on our
 side a step ladder 
and I with the baby and Ada m we
nt on the step ladder, went on 
the other side and later he 
took the step ladder away and we were
...we went out from his  apartment and 
_______________. We  took our armbands, we throw aw
ay our armbands. We  were as a 
Polish family. It was arranged for us to sleep th
e fi rst night not far fr om the rail station in 
______ and we...there wa s used to live a...uh 
this apartment belonged to the underground, 
but the ma n who owned the apartment for that 
night wasn't  sleeping in the house. He let 
us have it, but he didn't know that we we
re Jewish. He thought we were the underground, 
and in the same  building was the railroad Ge
stapo was in the first couple floors was the 
railroad Gestapo, so we felt very safe when 
we went upstairs. The next day we had to 
stay very quiet. She prepared...the lady of th
e house left some  food for us, and when it got 
a little dark around eight o'clock our plan
e was leaving to the city of ______, around 
eighty miles from Chicago, and there, there was arranged. 
 

Q: Eighty miles from where? 

 

A (Pela):  From ...(La ughter)...from Wa rsaw? 

 

Q: And you we re on a plane? 

 

A (Pela):  Yes, a plane. We  took a plane. We
 went a train. We t
ook a train eighty miles 
from Chicago. There the Jews lived he re completely in peace. The Germa n who was in 
uh in charge of this town was some how a 
very nice person and he was taking...the Jews 
were buying nice gifts and he 
told them you, you can stay in
 your homes. When I will get 
an order that we have to bring you in, I 
give you enough time to escape. So from there 
Ada m will tell you what... 
 

Answer (Adam) : There were exceptions, you know. Bu
t I like to get 
back Wa rsaw to me ntion to 
you what we had to go through even in Wa rsaw ghetto. Now when we decided to 

pre...you know, to get...we had the plan
 to..._________...when we, if whe n we how to 
plan to escape from ghetto, I was running ve
ry often after I escape 
already from Warsaw 
from prison fever, and one of our friends
, a physician in Wa rsaw ghetto, uh diagnosed 
that I have inflamed tonsils. He said if
 you don't get rid of these tonsils, you you you'll 
not be able to get out of ghetto because 
you'll be sick all the time. Where will you go 
then?  He said we have to remove your tonsil
s, but he had no anesthetic. He  had nothing. 
He hardly had even the right tool
s, so he decided to cut out the tonsils alive in my father's 
apartment in ghetto. I was sitting in the chai
r. My father was holding my hands in the 
back. Pela with the baby ran 
downstairs in the, into the 
courtyard because she couldn't 
look at it. She couldn't watch it, and he was cutting alive 
my tonsils, you know. Can you 
believe it? And and uh I I took anyway and it 
helped me  a lot. Now as Pela me ntioned, 
from that little town, you see, we went to 
a pl ace where I prepared 
in advance. I settled 
down Pela and the baby and I went back 
to Wa rsaw ghetto, the same  wa y–through the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

cemetery. Not to a funeral but through the 
cemetery. I again smuggled my self into the 
ghetto to get my...our parents, my father a
nd her parents. What we wanted to do...we 
picked out a bunker for them. You see, we 
could be uh we coul
d be, you know, visible 
because we looked typically Poles and Pela 
and I so we could be, you know, really on the 
outside, but they had to be in the bunker b
ecause the especially everybody the, the Polish 

people would recognize my father and my in-law
s that they are Jewish. So we prepared a 
special bunker for them, and when I came unfort unately when I was already on the 

cemetery, on my way back...it was only three days
 later...I uh some of
 the people told me 
don't, don't  try even to get in because you you'll be in spot because th
e ghetto is already 
on fire. They are...they are 
burning some  of the buildings. I took on...I put on some  
clothes on the cemetery...you know, one of the...see on the Jewi sh cemeteries in Poland 

were only working Jewish grave diggers. Th
at's why we could trust them. Here is 
different. Over there only Jewish grave diggers, 
so one of them gave me  his clothes. I put 
away mi ne and I put on his and togeth
er with him on a wag...you know, on a special 
wagon that they were picking up the dead, dead 
bodies, I went into the ghetto and when I 

came to our building, it was on fire and our
 parents were taken away already to 
Treblinka. I came just about a day too late. So
 our both parents and my father was already 
taken away. Of course, you can imagine how I co
uld break this kind of news to Pela and 
it was very difficult but she said again we ha
d now from then on the three of uh the two 
of us had only one aim and one purpose...to sa
ve the child. And we did everything in our 
in our, you know, power to save her. We liv
ed as Polish people, as Roma n Catholics. 
Pela used to go every Sunday to church and 
she learned how to pray and how to act and 
uh then in the meanti me  of course our daught
er developed from those wonderful things 
that she had around and the food she had, she 
developed tuberculosis
 and uh Pela took 
her to the hospital in Warsaw because uh men 
were afraid to, to travel. I was in the 
lumber...I was working, incidentally, in the lu
mb er yard as a laborer
, and she took her to 
the hospital and now wo uld you like to take.... 
 

Answer (Pela): ...came to...I heard of a of a 
doctor ____ even before the war Doctor ____, so I 
came to hi m with the baby and I, I told him sh
e's running such a fever. He examine d her. 

He said she has tuberculosis and we have to 
have to hospitalize her. I said but I have no 
money. My husband is a Polish...said who's in 
hiding. We  have no money. He said don't  
worry. I will take care of it. And he took the child
 but later he told me  that to, to be able 
to save the child, I need gol
d injections. He said we Po
les don't have...we cannot get it. 
You can get only in the German uh...but the Germ
an can get it or the Italians. I had a very 
close friend, _____ ______. He was a Greek who 
was a very close friend of ours and I 
went to him and I told him about Yasha. He 
said don't worry. I have some  friends in the 

Italian Embassy and I will see what...if you can
 get the pr escription, I will see what I can 

do. And he gave me  five milligrams of gold injections for five injections, and I brought it 

to the hospital. He was...Doctor could not beli
eve it. He said I don't know if we need all 
three of them...ma ybe three of them...all five
 of them...maybe thre
e will be enough. I said 
no Doctor. Take all five of them. I f you save my  daughter, use it for another child, but 

she also needed good food and nourishment, so the ma id of t he friend, _____ _____, 

every day came to the hospital with cooked 
some  soup for her. Even she had orange, 
apple and she ___ too, you know, ____. You see 
there are good people. There are still 
some  good people in this world.

Answer (Adam)  This particular friend of our
s is Greek, uh was arrested several times by the 
Gestapo for helping Jews. He was a wonderful person, a wonderful person. An elderly 

ma n...was much older than we, was a wonde
rful person. Anyway, then later on...so we 
leave...I worked on...you know, in the lumber yard
 as a laborer first, later in the office 
and we struggled a lot. We had to hide a 
lot because, you know, there were...we alwa ys 
were afraid some body...it, it was...let's put it 
this way if I think 
I me ntioned to you...very 
often we envied the pe ople that were in con
centration camps because we felt that at least 
they are thousands and hundreds of them. They
 know, they have sinned (ph). They know 
they are going to be killed, murdered, but 
they are together. We feel ___. We  are all 
alone. We are still young people in
 their twenties, uh 
two of us in thei
r twenties and with 
a baby, and uh nobody to talk to and we were afraid because, you see, me ntally, me ntally 

it was a tremendous or deal. Mentally, for us. Bu
t the ma in thing was to save the child and 

with the...and then luckily, ironically, Pela 
had to have emergency operation. She became  
ill. And I took her to a Catholic hospital in 
Warsaw. She was there six weeks. I gave the 
child, in the meanti me , into a sanatorium wh
ere they were run by nuns and not far from 
Warsaw. She was there. It's like an or phana
ge, sanatorium, an or
phanage, and children 
were there. I told them that I am a _____. I 
am ____. I can't  take the child with me , and 
the child was deaf (ph). It wasn't  easy to 
leave the child. You can imagine how she was 
crying when we were leaving her, but anyway I 
left her there and I traveled for six weeks, 
back and forth from that particular town wh
ere there was the lumber yard...I didn't work 
there in the lumber yard already...I was afraid
 to be caught and what would she do in the 
hospital and the child in sanatorium. So I wa
s living on the trains for eight weeks...six 
weeks it was, right. Six weeks you were in the 
hospital. On the trai
n...I shaved on the in 
the railroad stations and I 
living and sleeping on the trai
n, back and forth every day 
seeing her in the hospital, and uh then finally
 when she was released from the hospital I 
got another job on the railroad
 tracks with through some body th
at I me t, and in August of 
1944 we were liberated by the Russian army in
 a town...because already at that time  as 
you know, Russia and Germany were in at war,
 so liberated by the Russian army, and 
then uh in 1946...in 1945,'45 we esc a ped from
 Poland into the Ge
rman zo...into the 
American zone in Germany in a Russian ambulance. In a Russian ambulance we esca ped 

from Poland, and rode through the border 
Czecho...into Czechoslovakia, later to 
Germany and then in...we were in the DP ca mp
 in Feldafing where I worked also for a 
while in the at the with the Joint Distri
bution Committee and UNRA and a friend of ours, 
a friend...she befriended us. She was my 
superior uh you know, she was actually the 
ma nager of t he office where I was working. And she ma de an affidavit for us and she 

came to us one day and said would you like 
to go to the United States. This was 
Thursday. If you want to leave, you can leav
e Sunday. We  had not much packing to do, 
you know (laughter), so we decided to uh leav
e and that's  how this was...this was May, 
this was a long story.... And happened for a co
uple weeks that in 1946 on May 23rd or 
24th or 23rd, we arrived in United States, 
and I can only end with
 that you know, when 
we arrived, when we came here, this was 
the second transport ship. It wa s a Navy 

transport ship. We  ca me  as refugees on a Na
vy transport ship with three dollars in our 
pocket, and at night when we arrived, we we
re waiting for the customs to clear to cl ear 
us, and there were all kinds of sounds and sirens and the, the baby was scared. She was 

holding hands because scared and she said
 Mom, Daddy, are they
 killing people here? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
12 
 
Are we safe here?  And Pela took her around...da
rling, don't worry. You are in safety. You 
are in a free country, and then she turned to me
 and said Adam, I just can't believe it. We 
are alive and we'r e in the United States. Isn't 
this a mi racle, and I turned to them. They 
were both crying and Pela was crying and I turned to them, embraced them and I said 

look, Pela very often wanted already to 
give up, you know, and I said didn't  I tell you 
always never give up...there is always time to die. That's what gave me  the idea to for the 

title of my book, that it's called... 
 

Answer (Pela): Can I add some th
ing...that on this lumber yard where my husband worked, there 
were two more fa milies. One was a family Leiberbaur (ph) , who was like a ma nager, the 

right arm of this German ____ who was in char
ge of this lumber yard, and another wa s a 
young boy, ma ybe nineteen years old, who was 
ma naging the outside. He was like an 
outside...and Ada m said to me , you know, 
there is some thing about this boy uh... 
 

Answer (Adam) : I always said...his na me  was 
Wa lly (ph) ...you know, Wa llish in Polish, and I 
always said he's so dedicate, he's so nice. 
He never...because I was 
older...he never...if I 
wanted to pick up a piece of lumber, he w
ould say Mr. Bludosky, let me  help you. I said 
there is some thing about this boy. He is not
 the regular Polish boy. There is some thing 
about him that he is...and one day I decided 
to try him out. I said Wallish, how about this 
Sunday you go with me  to church, and the chur
ch was about three kilome ters away from 
the lumber yard where we  worked and where we lived on, and you had to walk to the 

highway and and on both sides of the highway ther
e were forests. So I...he said OK, let's 
go. So we were walking down the highway and I said to hi m,  Wa llish, what would you 

do if some  Jewish people that are hiding in th
e forest would jump, would attack us now. 
He said Mr. Bludosky, he said, called me Mr. Bludosky. They wouldn't, they, they 

have...they lie away...they live there...peopl
e leave them alone. They wouldn't hurt 
anybody. I sa id Wa llish, are you Jewish?  I am Jewi
sh. This way I went over to hi m. He 

embraced me. He started to cry, this young boy. 
You can't  imagine. He was Jewish. He 
was from the city of Lodz and he lived not far away from the lumber yard with his 

parents. His parents got a got a name  even 
before the war Rogeresky (ph)...very known in 
that city of Lodz because the ____ were ve
ry we ll-to-do people, had a bi g factory in 
Lodz, in the city of Lodz, a
nd he and unfortunately again...it'
s a long story...I described it 
in my book how I me t them and what happened 
to both of them. The other one and this 
one and they was killed. They 
were killed by the Gestapo. 
 

Answer (Pela): The sa me lumber yard were thre e fa milies who were not fr om, fr om this town 
and this was the _______ and one day he was...he had the mu mps. He got the mu mps . He 

was home . And the Gestapo came and asked him, are you Juda. Some body denounced

was uh ma king some  ____, you know, whiskey 
drink...there were....with some  uh pea s ants a
nd ma ybe he drink too much or had an 
argument with them and say they sent the Ge
stapo, so he turned to his mother, said 

mother, give me  poison, and the Gestapo killed him, killed his mother. The father wasn't  

home . He heard about it so he run away. The 
father survived. We me t hi m after the war. 
The other family was the Leiberbaur fa mily. 
He was in charge with Mr. ____ of this 
lumber yard. He was a very nice ma n. His wife

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
13 
 
little church or a house. She had a little 
boy by the name  ____. He 
was ma ybe a year and 
a half, two years olde r than my Yasha, and they became very friendly. And uh one day 
they came to us and they said that they ha

them a letter and said, Mr. Liberbauer, 
where you come from, ____...he came from 
______. In this place where you used to work
 came  Gestapo and asked for you, and if 
even if you are converted, you better run away, 
because they are after you. He came to us 
and said what to do. So we said go. ____ that
 night and take the 
train to Warsaw and 
from there he  went, they went to a little like a resort place, _____. Be there for a while 

and if you want to send any me ssages, sent
 to Mr. _____. I see him a couple of times a 

week. You can say go to Warsaw, and 
I will let you know if everybody...if some body 
came to ask for you or just a hoax. So came a c
ouple of weeks, three or four weeks came  
by and he was writing little notes to Mr. 
_____ saying I cannot stay any longer. People 
start to look at me . Maybe this was a hoax. 
Maybe I should come  home . Ada m wrote to 
him, please, wait yet I am not sure yet, but 
he didn't listen to us and he came  back. One 
afternoon Adam was in the office and he will tell how it was. 
 

A (Ada m) :  When this, this Liberbaur was Jewish but converted because he  ma rried a 
Catholic uh woma n and when they discove
red that he's  Jewish...you know, of Jewish 

origin and I was at that time already they
 promoted me  from...you know, I was a laborer 
and then I work in the offi ce a little bit, 
and I was in the office in the morning and 

Liberbauer was there and all of a sudden the 
door opens and the Gestapo walks in. They 
point at ...who is Liberbauer. He says I am 
Liberbauer. They took 
him away and took him 
out and uh to ma ke the story short, they kill
ed him. In the me antime his wife run away 

with the baby, so as you can see, two of
 them, thi s  little boy from...this young boy from 

Lodz and he was killed by the Gestapo. 
 
Answer (Pela): Why why it was so dangerous for us
 to remain in this lumber yard, because we 
were the only strangers from this town, who 
were not born in this town and people started 
to talk and one night we were sitting...we 
were home and one of our workers from the 
lumber yard, with a bottle of whiskey...he sai
d, Mr. Bludosky, I had to drink...or I have to 
take a good drink before I have the guts 
to come  to you and to ask you...look, there is 
enough bloodshed on this lumber yard. If you 
have anything to hide, please, leave the 

lumber yard. Enough, please. So Adam looked at
 me and I crossed myself. I said you see 
Ada m, that's what you're you have for bei
ng a good Pole. I left my fa mily. I left 

everythi ng...everybody, because you were afraid because you want to work for the 

underground and now your own people for whom
 you are working so hard are calling 
you to be a Jew. And now this is this is the 
thanks you have. So he looked at us. He said, 
oh Mr. Bludosky, no. Oh I am...oh we should have
 more me n like you. I am so glad and 
because I had no other choice. I ha d no place 
to go. Joanne...my Yasha was after...she 
after tuberculosis I couldn't  take her to 
the woods, so I pray for ___ and that's  _____ but 
one one day, ma ybe a couple of mont hs later,

A (Pela):  ...see there is a way. Adam had, he to
ld you that for a while he had to live on the 
train because one afternoon the German who wa s in charge  of the, of the lumber yard 
called in Adam. He was a little high. He wa
s a little drunk. He said, Mr. Bludosky, what I 
hear...such an _____. They say that you are Je
wish. If some body else will come  and say 
it, I'm going to give it to them. Ada m , Ad
a m was bewildered but some how composed 
himself. He said I'm not Jewish, Mr. ____. I'm 
not Jewish. But since then he felt that it 
was very dangerous for us to rema in there. This
 is why when I was still in the hospital, he 
was...tried not to be too much home , but 
after the hospital...uh 
during the ho...really, I 
didn't have to stay five weeks, but I really
 didn't have no place to go. So I think that 
Professor _____, the one who operated on me
 maybe during the operation and ma ybe  
because I later found out that he was a very 
good Pole, that because he save d in his own 
house, he saved a Professor ___ who was his assi
stant. He saved him in his own house, so 
I don't know...ma ybe he he probably knew that 
I am Jewish. But one day, was ma ybe the 
fourth week...his assistant came over to me . Wh
at in the hell, he said, are you doing here 
yet. It's time  for you to go home . I didn't answer
 him, but I started to cry and I turned my 
head and at that mo me nt,a couple of mi nutes 
later Professor ____ , a
ll his assistants came  
every day to ma ke the rounds, and my...I was in
 a in a four-bed uh ward and my bed was 
just right...as you came in my bed was first, 
so he looks at me and I turned my...nor mally 
I was smiling to him, greeting hi m wi th a smile. This time I turned my head because I 

was crying and I didn't want to see him, so he came to the bed, sit down. He said what's 

going on?  Why are you crying?  
I said oh nothing. He said some body did some thing to 
you?  Please tell me . I a m in charge  of this hos
pital. I want to know. I said no, because the 

ma n who told this to me  was just behind you. So I didn't say one word. Next to me  was a, 

another lady, a Polish lady, who became very fr
iendly. She liked me  very much. She said 

to me she never had a sister but I am like a si
ster to her, and she said you know, when she 
heard that uh I told hi m that my husband trav
els and I have to wait till he will come to 
pick me  up...she said if you want you can co
me  and stay with me . And later in the 
conversation she said, you know, I know it's 
terrible that the Germans occupied our 

country, but one thing we  have to
 be grateful to them...they go
t rid of the Jews, got us rid 
of the Jews. So that was the wonderful frie
nd of mi ne. So it was very hard and it...when 
he came to see...to visit me and I knew that 
I had to leave the hospi
tal, I said Adam, we 
have no other choice. Let me  go some place. I 
will throw myself down from the...and kill 
myself and you will st ay with the ba by. But of course he didn't and through another 

friend who got this job in another part of Po
land and during the night we packed our little 
belongings and went to this little tow
n. This was ______, not far from ____ and there 
was–there the Russians uh liberated us, but 
it wasn't  easy because the town was going 
back and forth for ma ybe  five days. Once the Germans got it. Once the Russians. And we 

were hidden. A couple of people, ma ybe seven 
or eight grown-ups and children, were in a 

cell in a, a like a bunker made where used 
to keep the potatoes, but this was not 
connected to the house. It was outside. We  were there, and we heard the bombing and 

and the scream... 
 

Answer (Adam) : ...calle
d a cellar, cellar... 
 

A (Pela):...and we were screaming and, and, a
nd heard Russian voices and when German voices 
we were very quiet. We  had nothing to eat. Wa s 
very little wa ter and one night it became  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221

very quiet and the same  day, the next day, wa
s very quiet. ___ the ma n said, we had to 
take a chance. We 'll open a little the lid and 
we'l l look out and when they opened the lid, 
the, the house was burned completely. This...the
 place where the, the all the cows and the, 
the horses were dead. Everything was kille
d. And they...when they looked out, they saw 
Russian tanks and uh you know, they greeted th
em and Adam walked over to one of the 
officers there. He looked to him like he was 
Jewish. He looked very, very warm. So he 
said to him, ________. ____ during the war...duri
ng the war it was like one Jew wanted 
that, so he answered him, and Ada m asked him what should I do. Should I say who I am?  
He said don't say nothi ng yet, because we now have the town. In a couple of days we can 

loose the town. Just play the way it was, but 
he helped us. He  gave us some  milk. He  
gave us some butter and uh some thing for the baby, so that's as it was. It wasn't  easy. 
 

Q: When did you...how did you get the ba
by...no longer a baby act
ually...out of the 
sanitarium uh or out of the place where she 
was and what was she like...was she happy? 
 

A:  OK. When we...when I came back from the hospital and Adam changed the jobs, and we 
saw already...this was not far from a r a il
road station _____. We saw the trains comi ng 
from the Russian border and there was a lot of
 trains with soldiers and some  of them 
wounded soldiers or German soldiers, so we realized that the war was comi ng to an end. 

And Ada m s a id to me , I have to...you have to go to ____ and pick up Yasha because it 

will not be  good separated. And I went there a
nd I told them that 
I'm feeling better. I 
thanked them for taking care of her and I br
ought her home. My Yasha, during the all the 
years she didn't know she was Jewish. She like anybody else. Uh one day she came with 

the ___ friend of hers, with a little branch
 and, and like, like a 
gun on her shoulder said 
Mommy, we  are going to the woods to hunt fo
r Jews. And uh she, she knew she was like 

anybody else. She...I don't think she suffere
d. She didn't know nothing what we were 
going through. But uh when we decided that
 it's time to...after the liberation we 
went...later was liberated...Wa rs
aw was liberated. We  went to Wa rsaw. Of course we had 
no...was no transportation but the trucks of so
ldiers always picked up people on the wa y 
and we came to Wa rsaw and uh there was a Jewi
sh community and we registered that we 
are looking for anybody who survived, and 
of course nobody survived. And uh from 
there we decided it's time to leave Poland. 
There was already...they establish already a 
DP ca mp in Germany and the...in West uh in 
West Germany and uh the war almost to an 
end. It was uh...the war ended in May and wh
en we decided to leave was around August, 
so we went to a friend of ours who we knew th
at she lives in Lodz. 
We  went there and uh 
we lived there for a couple of days and 
we tried to ma ke connection...we knew that 
Russian ambulances going to Czechoslovaki
a are taking...for money are taking people 
who want to escape from Poland, so we ma de
 the connection, but before we, we were 
able to leave, the friend of mi ne asked me...Sophie I have to do something. Will you 

come  and he lp me ?  I said OK. She s a id let Adam go with us. So we went out for an hour, 

and we left our daughter with a woman who 
was her like housekeeper. She also came  
from concentration camp and she didn't  have w
ith whom to live, so for helping her uh be 
a housekeeper she had her room and board. So we left and we  came after an hour...the 

woma n was crying, so my friend asked her 
why are you crying. She said please, don't 
ever leave me with this child uh alone. So 
I said why?  What did she do?  She said she 
wanted to go on a step ladder and I was afraid 
that she would get hurt.
 I told her not to do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
16 
 
it. She said you dirty Jewess. Y
ou have no right to tell me  what
 to do or not to do. So my 
friend says to me , now. I said ma ybe not now
 yet. She said now. She called in my 
daughter. She said Yasha, why did you call he r dirty Jewess. Because she is. She said 
what would you say if I would tell you that 
your mother and father is Jewish and you are 
Jewish. Oh no. That's  not true. My mother
 is not dark with a long nose and my 
father...no, it's not true. No. 
Mommy...Daddy...tell me  the truth. Aunt Eva (ph) is just 
pretending. It's not true. So Ada m said to he
r, yes darling, we had to pretend that we'r e 
not Jew...not Jewish because we wanted to save you, but we are Jewish and you are 

Jewish. She started to cry and she ran to he
r bedroom, closed hers
elf on a key (ph) and 
was sobbing and I was standing and begging 
her to open the door. She didn't for maybe 

an hour and then she opened the door. She came 
out, swollen eyes. She had...in her hand 
she had a little string where she had the cross 
on it. She said if this
 is not my God, you 
show me  my  new God. I said we don't have a 
pi cture of God, but when we will come  to 
Germany I will buy you...I will ha ve ten 
comma ndments...I will buy you the ten 
commandments and this will your....so when we came to Germany, Ada m got the ten 

commandments for her. We didn't have uh a chai
n so with a, a safety pin we put it on her 
sweater and every night she 
asked us to put the sweater
 under her pillow because she 
wanted to sleep with it, her new God. But it wa
s very hard for her. She...when we came to 
the United St ates, she had a lot of nightmar
es. She wan...didn't want to go to sleep. She 
had...when I took her to a psychi
atrist they said that she became  what she hated. She 
hated the Jews like everybody else there, and sh
e became a Jew. It was ha rd for her to, to 
become  wha t  she hated, but with years passed by and uh she some how got some  friends. 

In the beginning she had a very hard time.
 She spoke only German and Polish and she 
wanted to be outside with the children
 to play. She asked them some thing in 
Ger...Germa n or some thing in Polish. They fi
rst make faces at her 
and, and ma de fun of 
her. They said they didn't understand her, so 
she cried and I told her darling, they didn't  
understand you. You will learn Engl
ish and you will be able to 
play with them. So she 
had a very hard time . But when we were approached by the _____ University to ma ke 

Voices, the story of three of three families and she heard our story and she wanted to get 

in touch with my daughter. I told him th
at she probably will not agree because she 
was...when she saw a German unifor m she coul
d not even talk about what happened. So 
he said pl ease give me her number. I will talk to her. He called her. In the beginning she 

said no, but after a while she said OK. I w
ill let you come, but when I will start cryi ng, 

please stop filming. He said I promise you. And when I saw the Voices...and I I wasn't  

present when he interviewed her...I found out when she was going to gramma r school, 

she was already in the first grade, not in ki
ndergarten, first grade,
 when I took her to 
school and we had to cross some  streets...I 
crossed with her...and when she had no more 
streets to cross she said Mommy, you 
go home . I already have...now you know, I am 
already OK and I am right away going to 
school. And when I left and she turned 
around...she saw me  leaving...she ru
n three blocks to the near
est church and she said I 
knew when I will cross myself
 I will have a good day. (Laughter) And that's it. 
 

Q: Pela.... 

 

A (Pela):  And one....when we we re already he
re...this was...she was at that time also 
around uh six and a half years old...she was...we 
lived in another apartment. We  lived in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
17 
 
another apartment...not in the same school, a
nother apartment we had. We  moved. In the 
United States, in Chicago. This is where 
we lived on Madison...hear
 ____ hotel...I don't 
know if you know Chicago...near 
_____hotel. So, uh there wa s a store, a grocery store 
and the people were Jewish. In the beginning 
I had some ti me s to use a Jewi sh word if I 
wanted something what I...my English was ve
ry bad, so she knew that they are Jewish 
and it came  before Christma s time...s he wanted
 a Christma s tree. I said darling, Jewish 
people don't have Christma s tree. We have Hanukkah and Hanukkah ma n come s and 
brings eight presents, so I 
bought some  presents and Ada m used to knock at the door 
outside and oh the Hanukkah ma n ca me  and she 
got some  presents. One day just before 
Christma s and we went...I went with her to th
e store and she looked in the store. In the 
window was a very big Christma s tree and she we
nt into the store with me  and she said 
Mommy, look. You are a liar. You told me  that
 Jewish people don't have Christma s trees. 
They are Jewish people and they have a Christ
ma s tree. So you see it was very hard for 

her to...the change was very hard for her, 
but some how now she's a very adjusted young 
lady, adjusted. She's going through a trauma  but I hope she's... 
 

Answer (Adam) : The ma in thing is that we were
 able to sa ve he r because this was our dream. 
This was our aim. This was our purpose, you know
. We  did everything re
ally just for this 
child to, to save her and, you know, after we
 were starving with 
nothing to eat, three 
times a day in the lumber yard we had for the mo rning she would cook a few potatoes, 

for lunch few potatoes and for dinner few potat
oes if she was lucky to get them. If you 
were lucky to get an apple, let's say, ma ybe lu
cky ones to get an apple, I peeled the apple 
and we gave it first to our child, and we were 
fighting with each other.
 I wanted her to eat 
the peels...she wanted me to eat the peels, you know, and in order we should get 

some thing, and I I was the winner always, you 
know. I mean, she had to eat it, but the 
child was always the ma in thing in our...and we 
really truly we lived only for her. That I 
can say. 
 

Answer (Pela): Tell her a
bout the first time we came ____, t hat you stole some . 
 

Answer (Adam) : Yeah. You see, my  father had 
a friend of...business associated, used to deal 
with him before the war, and he was from a 
different part, a worser part of Poland that 
they were settled later into Warsaw during the 
war and uh he lived in of course outside of 
the wall in the Polish neighborhood. When we were
 already on the Polish papers living in 
the lumber yard, you know, I used to once in a while come  to Warsaw by train and I 

asked him to let me  sleep in his apartment so 
I used to sleep on the floor in the kitchen. 

Of course, I realized that he
 was risking his and his family's  life once he, you know, let a 
Jewish ma n be in his place and in the morn
ing, one morning, I got up and in his kitchen 
on a string were hanging Polish sausages, you 
know. I stole one Polish sausage. I put it 
into my, you know, coat and I traveled the 
eighty miles by train. 
I was hungry like a dog 
but I wouldn't  touch it. I brought it to them 
and tried that they should have it. I I don't 
think that I was a hero over th
is, you know. I think that that's
 that was a natural thing for 
me  to do. I didn't know another way, you know...just for them. And that's, that's how we 

survived. We came to the United States with 
three dollars in our poc ket that ____ gave us 
on the Navy transport ship and when the uh social service came, they wa nted to wanted 

to give me some...maybe you n eed some money. I said no, I 
have ten fingers and I I am 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0221  
18 
 
an accountant but as I have ten fingers...get me
 any kind of work and I was working as a 
laborer in the stock yard in the begi
nning, you know, and uh I wouldn't take any 
handouts. 
 
Answer (Pela): You know, it was not
 only stock yards. He had five, five jobs. He was in a mi rror 
(ph) factory, a ___.... 
 

A (Ada m) :  Oh ma ny, ma ny, many. I worked 
like, you know, from one __ to another... 
 

A (Pela):  And wanted to get enough...uh we 
came with the second 
boat, _______. The first 
one was Maria Fletcher (ph)...came uh some bod
y who we knew from Warsaw. He came  
with his wife and she became...she was pregna

died. So I went to her funeral with a 
friend, ____, some body who I knew in Germany and 
she came also to Chicago and we went to the uh to the temple. As we were sitting, a ma n 

passed by and he started to scream rouse,

already...I had one bedroom apartment and we
...Joanna had...Yasha had the bed the bed 
in this little bedroom and I and Adam slep

bed...our head was to the radiators and the feet near 
the stove, so I invited them to come  
to meet my husband on Sunday and this friends
hip of three of these people...this is the 
way we started our business. I saved enough mo
ney to buy my daughter a little bicycle, a 
three-wheeled bicycle...

give you a job. We 'r e very grateful, and he di
d. He got a job. Worked there for six weeks 
and came to the boys. He said boys, I know how
 to ma ke these footballs and let's open 
our factory ourself. OK. We  needed some  m
oney. We  needed uh to start...he had four 
hundred dollars but he wa s the one who knows how to sew. Another partner needed two 

thousand dollars but he had it, but we didn'
t have two thousand cen
ts...so we started to 
ask some  fri e nds and we had wonderful
 friends, people who was only a couple 

weeks...one lent us three hundred dollars. He 
was a butcher and this was a lot of money 
in 1946, 1947, and another was a place here in 
Chicago, Herman Bush (ph). They had a 
general cleaning uh ___ factory...five hundred do
llars and another five hundred....to ma ke

was back from Ger many in New York and he 
said to her I want to open a factory with 
two other boys, but I need seven hundred dollars. She said Adam, take a train. Come  t o 

us, tell us about it and we will talk to you. He
 took a train, came  there, and she listened to 

him. She said I think boys you will ma ke it. She gave him a new check. He didn't even

open the envelope. When he came home in th
e envelope was a thousand dollars. I said oh

 only seven hundred dollars. I took out a 
money order and sent the three hundred dollars...s
ent her back the thee hundred dollars to

draw anything but the landlor
d with whom we lived who also lent us five hundred 

dollars...he was one of them...gave him gave hi
m thirty-five dollars every weeks that I 
should not know that he...supported...and we...a
fter a while the factory progressed and 
then came from business became i mporters. We
 traveled all over the world. We were 
importing goods from Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong...I was in, in Pa kistan, in 

India...everywhere we traveled. So England...

Q: Anything any of you wa nt to add? 

 

A (Ada m) :  That's the ma in thing is and the last I think... 
 
A (Pela):  ...the, the penny project... 

 

A (Ada m) :  The penny project...you heard about 
it, the penny project that we have. We 
thought that about being that 
the Jewish life wasn't  worth a penny, so let's collect six 
million pennies in me mo ry of the uh six million Je ws and we do. We  have interviews in 

different papers and I uh tell you...even in Isra
el in newspapers. I r
eceived from Israel 
pap...a newspaper with an article about the 
pennies...and here throughout the States and I 
am getting pennies via UPS...would you believe  (laughter) and uh I sent over twenty 

thousand dollars already to the United...to the
...to Wa shington, DC 
and we  hope that we  
will get soon, you know, the balance which is 
actually si xty thousand dollars, you know, 
six million pennies, but uh I think that  the Un
ited States Holocaust Memorial Museum is 
the best thing that that could happen to us
, you know, because after all, millions of 
people, as you know, are trav
eling to, going through Wa shingt
on, DC every year, Jewish 
and non-Jewi sh people, and this was...this wi
ll be like ____ in Jerusalem. It will...the 
same thing will be in the United States. I thi
nk it's a tremendous idea and we like to...we 

are involved in it, of course, and we try to be more involved yet, and we thank you so 

much for interviewing us and if we can be
 of any assistance to you, just let us know.
