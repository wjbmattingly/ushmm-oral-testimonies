T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hatyou are about to

Syl via Rozines was born Cywia Perelm uterto Jewish parents, Icekand Chaja on 
January
 
20, 1935, in Lodz, Poland.
 
Herfather worked in a wholesalef lourand sugar 
cooperative and hermother caredfor Sylvia andher sister Dora, who was seven years older.
 
T his photograph of  Syl via was taken around 1938.
 
   
On thism ap of Poland, the arrow points to Lodz.
 
  
Here we see Sylvia on the left,herf ather in the m iddle,and her older sister, Dora,on 
the right.
 
Sylvia was about 3 years old whenthis photo was tak
en.
 
   
In September
 
1939, whenSyl via was 4 years  old, Germany invaded Poland,off icially 
b e gi n n i n g W or ld W ar  I I.
 
W ithin sevendays German troops enteredandoccupied the city of  
Lodz.
 
This historic photograph shows Germ an troops entering Lodz.
 
   
In  
February
 
1940, Germ an authoritiesestablisheda ghetto inLodz.
 
Jews li ved 
isolated f rom the rest of  the city in an area enclosed by barbed
-
wire fencing.
 
T he sign in this 
Germ an postcard of Lodz reads, " Jewish residential area
 
--
 
entry forbidden."
 
   
G e rm a
n authorities began deportations in 1942f rom  the ghetto tothe Chelm no killing 
center.
 
Thedeportations targeted children in1943, but Sylvia's f ather m anagedtof inddifferent 
hiding placesfor her.
 
Then in 1944, mostof  the remaining Jews in Lodz were d
eported to 
A u sch wit z-
Bi rkenau.
 
Syl via's parents and sister avoideddeportationbecause they were 

3 
 
chosen to clean the ghetto.
 
T hey hidSyl via in a cellar along with 11other Jewish children 
whose parents rem ained working in Lodz.
 
In January of  1945, the Sov
iet Arm y liberatedthe 
800 remaining Jews f rom  the Lodz ghetto.
 
   
Syl via's f am ily relocated toa displaced persons cam p in Germ any.
 
In this photograph 
we see Syl via, circled, at the displaced persons cam p in 1947.
 
Sylvi a eventually li ved in Paris 
u n t il em
igrating to theUnited States in1957.
A
f ter living 10 years in France, Sylvia and her 
father imm igrated to the United States in 1957 joining Doraandherhusband Jack who had 
m oved earlier to Albany, Ne w York.
 
   
Syl via got a job ina dress shop. Shem arried David Rozines, who was alsoa 
Holocaust survi vor, in 1959. David worked insales.T hey hada sonGreg, who graduatedwith 

a degree in engineering f rom the State University of  New York at Binghamton.
 
 
I'd like to mention that Greg is here inthef ront row with Syl via.
 
 
Syl via went tonight school andthen went towork f or the New York Public Schools, 
where she workedf or24 years.
 
Sylvia's husband David passed away in 1999atage 69. 
S yl vi a
 
m oved to theW ashington, DC area to be close toher son. 
S yl vi a
 
has two grandchildren, 
Jeff ery and Alyssa.
 
     
 
Syl via began volunteering with this museum 's Visitor Services in 2014. You will f ind 
her atthe Information Desk on Mondays. Syl via only recently began speaking about what she 

went through inthe Lodz ghetto
 
and is now speaking in local schools including Montgom ery 
College. She also speaks to groups here in the Museum.
 
   
In collaboration with her niece
,  
Jennifer Roy, Syl via's story was published with the title 
" Yellow Star."  Her book, which has now sold m ore
 
than 150,000 copies, is used widely in 
schools and has been published in a number of  countries including Brazil, Belgium , the 

4 
 
Netherlands, Germany and Spain.
 
Following t oday's program , Syl via wil l sign copies of " Yellow 
S ta r."
  
     
 
W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcoming our First Person,Syl via Rozines.
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sylvia, thank you som uch forjoining us.
 
 
W eare going to start, because our time is so lim ited, so let's startf irst with your very 
early years in your family.
 
You were not yet 5when Germ any invaded PolandSeptem ber
 
1 , 
1939, startingW orldWar II.
 
Bef ore we turn tothe war and the Holocaust,tell usa littlebit 
about yourf am ily andyour com munityf romwhat you know in those years before the war 
began. 
 
>> S y l v
ia Rozines:
 
W e had a very nice lif e.
 
Thefam ily was al ways together celebrating the 
holidays.
 
And we were  ver y happy
 u
ntil the Germ ans invaded pollen.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe talk about that, tellus a little about your mom and dad.
 
For one 
thing, you told me thatthey loved theater, loved dressing up.
 
Your m other liked silent m ovies.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
My m other lovedthe American silent movies.
 
She was a terrif ic 
dancer.
 
Every Frida y night they went dancing.
 
They loved to be dressed up all theti
m e.
 
A nd  I  
can see onm y pictures how nice they dressed me andm y sister.
 
I had a very lo vable m other 
and father.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your f ather served in the Polish Arm y.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you know anything about thatperiodof his 
lif e ?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
No .
 
No .
 
T hat was before he got married.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
How lar ge was your extended fam ily? 
 

5 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
I had many, many unclesandaunts and we all lived alm ost in the same 
area.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So a large extended fam
ily li vi n g c lo s e  b y.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you had said to me that yours was a very close fam ily.
 
You lived closebut 
you were also closely knit.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s,  ye s.
 
W e helped each other.
 
W e love eachother.
 
Yeah.
 
>> B ill B e n
son:
 
And Dora, justa little bit about Dora, she was seven years older than you so 
she rem em bereda great deal about thoseearly years.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Actually, m y sister didn't talk about it.
 
So when Ineeded som e information 
about thebook, she didn't rem em ber asm uch as I did because she put it away.
 
Once you stop 
t a lk in g
 
--
 
I also did it, but when Iarrived here inW ashington and we startedto write the book, 
things came back to me.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And we're going to hear hopef ully
 
--
 
not all butm any of  the things you wer e 
able to write about in the book.
 
 
As we noted earlier, when we were showing the slides, within seven days of  Germany 
occupying Poland they occupied your city of  Lodz andthey unleashed the horrors of  the 
Holocaust on yourfam ily and the nearly 250,000 Jews that lived in Lodz.
 
T ellus what you can 
about what happened to your fam ily when the Germansoccupied Lodz but bef orethey putyou 

into the ghetto.
 
W hat was that period like?
 
Do you know? 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T his periodI don't rem ember beforebut I rem ember being in the ghettoand 
I remember thebarbed
-
wires, and soldiers standing all around guarding us so we couldn't 
escape on the Polish side.
 
It was ver y cro wded.
 

6 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe go to the ghetto, just a couple of  comm
ent s .
 
In your book you wrote 
about when the Germansfirst cam e in, you and yourf am ily l
e f t 
in a buggy.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Oh, yes.
 
T he Germ an decidedtom ake the city of Lodz a German city.
 
All 
the Jews had to leave.
 
Som y f atherhired horse and buggy.
 
It
 
was wintertime.
 
W e went to 
W arsaw with our uncle and his two children.
 
So we were two f am ilies with two children.
 
A nd  
when we arri ved inW arsaw, ever ything was bom bed, the houses.
 
W e couldn'tf inda place to 
s t a y.
 
And that was one of  the best decisions m y
 
f atherm ade, to return to Lodz.
 
And when we 
returned to Lodz, then they decided tom ake the ghetto.
 
That city had many factories.
 
T here 
was not muchbom bing.
 
T hef actories stayed in
tact.
 
And they decided to put the people to 
wo r k .
 
It dependson your profe
ssion. 
They assigned you make clothes if  you were a tailor,a 
s
hoe
 
m aker.
 
 
My f ather, they askedwhat you were doing bef ore the war.
 
He saidhe worked with 
f lour and sugar.
 
So the good part, they madehim  deliver f lour
 
--
 
there were bakeries, to bake 
the b
read.
 
Of  course thef lour was very
 
--
 
it was not really the goodflour but we have happy.
 
W orking with f lour, som etimes it spilleda little bit.
 
The older people used to grab a little bit.
 
And 
at the endof  theday the whole group who worked together divid
ed.
 
So everybody could have 
a little bit of f lour.
 
So that helped.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And whenthey didthat, they were not supposed todo that, right?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
No .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothat was a clandestine thing they did.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
Th
ey wore white uniform s.
 
Andthey had packets made special.
 
You 
only could take a little bit because they wei gh it.
 
And only ver y strong m en coulddo it.
 
You had 
to carry a bag of 100
 
kilos of f lour to take it off thebuggy and bring itto the bakery.
 

7 
 
>> B i
ll Benson:
 
W henyou f irst entered the ghetto, when you were forced to go in there with 
your f am ily and all the other Jews were forced in there, you sharedwith me that as you went 
into it, you remember holding Dora's hand.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
She always wat
ched m e.
 
But I don't have recollection going into.
 
It m ay be 
m ay
be we lived therebef ore because som eof  the streets people lived and some peopledidn't 
have to m ove.
 
T he people who were in a certain section where theGerm an didn't want, you 
m oved.
 
A n d af t
er a while they put another f amily with a little girl who becam em y bestfriend, in 
our apartment.
 
So we lived seven people in aroom and a kitchen.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One room and a kitchen, seven of you in there.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Rig h t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And then you gotanotherf riend.
 
You had two f riends.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Once the parents wentto work, the children were lef talone.
 
And we were 
s m a ll c h ild ren .
 
In the beginning m y sister was  thebabysitter but then she was oldenough, they 
took 
even 10 years old to go to f actories to work, maybe younger.
 
But thenI was lef t alone.
 
 
So we got in oneof  the other little girl's
 
--
 
the other little girl li ved just across.
 
H e r 
name was Hava.
 
If ound out she was two year s older than me.
 
Shehad a little brother.
 
W e 
stayed in thatapartm ent till ourparents cam e f rom  work.
 
All the toys we had, I had a beautiful 
doll and carriage which I rememberbecauseof  apicture with them.
 
Ever ything was sold.
 
In the 
beginning we could exchange with Polishpeople.
 
We
 
only wantedfood, so we gave the toys, 
clothes, atnight you madethe exchange.
 
Af ter a while we didn't have anything else.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you would swap a shirt fora little bit of food until you ran out.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
W e had to give
 
--
 
m y f ather, I remember, toldm e, he gave a suit and two 
pair of pants justfor apound of butter.
 
You had to give a lot.
 

8 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To geta pound of butter.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
And that was the last tim e I ate butter.
 
And Idon't remember the taste of  it.
 
Many
 
f oodsaf terthe war I didn't know what they were.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwork was your m otherand Dora made to do?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Yeah, Dora went toafactory with m y m other.
 
T hey were m aking lady 
undergarm ents.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And who were they making 
them f or?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
For the Germans.
 
Everythi ng was sent to Germany.
 
T hey received a little 
soup and a slice of  bread.
 
Andthe soup was m ostly water.
 
But if  you're hungry, ever ything 
tastes good.
 
 
Also, we had rations to get f oodfor the week.
 
Yo u
 
had to goto certain stores.
 
You had 
a little booklet.
 
Youhad to wait in line.
 
And som etimes by the timeyour turn cam e,thef ood 
was out.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You wr ote in your book
 
--
 
this was about the winter of  1941.
 
You said, "W inter 
erases whole fam ilie
s.  
It alsoerased the vegetablesthat we gre w."
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
W ecould make little gardens.
 
In thebackyard, the courtyard had 
cem entbut we rippedout the cement toplant.
 
Theonly thing I could rem em ber m yf ather 
planted during the summ er is potatoes because we didn'thave seeds and beets.
 
W e were 
happy.
 
In the summ erwe had a little bitm ore food.
 
T he winters wer e terriblebecause they 
stopped giving us woo d to m ake our apartment warm .
 
W e had ovens.
 
You had tom ake af ire 
and cook.
 
A nd  lit t le
 
by little we usedfurniture.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
F o r  f uel ?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
For fuel, yes.
 
Andthen itwas getting harder and harder.
 

9 
 
 
T he  f oo d
 
--
 
being hungry, m ost of the people thoughtabout it.
 
W henyou hungry, how 
tom akediff erent recipes what they gave us.
 
I rem em ber whatever they gave us you had to 
f ind a way ho w tof ix it because you just had som e oil but theoil was such a poor quality.
 
I 
thought the oil was used form achine.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that's what you had for cooking.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 F
or cooking, just tohave a little grease.
 
Butpeople were getting thinner 
andthinner on the streets.
 
I could see people dropping on the streets.
 
There were children, 
older children, who had a job to pickup thedeadpeopleand put them  on horse andbuggie
s 
and bury them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The children were doing that.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Som etim es children, sometimes grown
-
up.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As terrible asthe conditions were that you've just given us a glim pse of in the 
Lodz ghetto, they, of course,becam e 
so 
m uch worse oncethe Nazis
 
began deporting Jews 
outof  the ghettoand sending them  to a killing center, Chelm no.
 
T he Nazis were intent on 
getting all the kids andtaking them .
 
Tell us what your life was like once thosedeportations
 
--
 
especially when they were af ter the kids.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T hat was m y worst tim e, when they decided,and the parentshad to give 
up the children.
 
Butthey m ade it sound so good, that we are goingto cam p, toGermany,and 
the children going to have food.
 
Give away your chi
ldren.
 
Here yougo to work
; t
he children are 
staying by them selves and there is nof ood.
 
And som e people believed because they couldn't 
see the children starving.
  
 
But I had a very courageous father.
 
He wouldn't give m eaway.
 
Each time they came 
to  ge t th
e children, he used to hide m e.
 
My worst memory was the last time
 
--
 
he couldn't find 

10
 
 
places anym ore.
 
Sohe decided there was a cemetery behind our backyard.
 
T here was a big 
wa ll.
 
He decidedtohide me in the cem etery.
 
T here was a raidatnight.
 
And I 
re mem b e r 
waking up and scream ing thatI don't want todie.
 
W e really didn't know that we were going to 
die because they said they were going to send us to cam p and we were going to have a good 
tim e there.
 
And m y father grabbed m e
 
--
 
it was during the night
. 
They barricaded certain 
streets because they couldn't get the children.
 
So they arrived.
 
W edidn't know that night they 
were going to com e.
 
Som etimes we knew but this time we didn't. So m y father grabbed me, 
and we went down I think the window and we clim bed that wall andhe made aholeand put 

m e in the hole.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In the cem etery.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
In the cem etery.
 
And covered me with grass.
 
W e stayed there m ore than 
24 hours, tillm y sister came and told us they are goneand you cancom e out
. 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you rem em ber how f rightened you were?
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
BecauseI was already, at the time
 
--
 
tha t wa s
 
--
 
I was like 8 orm aybe 
older.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hen that happened.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Rig h t .
 
T hat's why I rem ember.
 
T h is  
incident lef t m e for lif e.
 
Years and years 
af t e r
,  
I had this dream .
 
I t  c am e ve r y o f t e n.
 
I lived in France10 years.
 
And all through thattim e 
m aybe onceam onth Ihad this dream of I'm staying in the hole andthe German
, 
I look up, 
standing with a gun, and
 
m y f athernext, andI said "He's killing m e" andI wake up.
 
It was the 
sam e dream .
 
Until I cam eto Am erica in 1957,f or som e reason thedream  stopped.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you had itall those m any years.
 

11
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
But I live alwa ys with f ear.
 
I k
new I'm  in Am erica.
 
AndI knew there were no 
Germ ans.
 
But I always  was af raid to stay by m yself .
 
>> Bill Benson: Sylvia, you also shared that Ibelieve you lost yourf riend
, 
Hava.
 
S he  
disappeared.
 
T hen you lost your other friend, Itka.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T hat was when they decided in 1944everybody has to leave.
 
They lef t
 
--
 
I 
rem em ber very well, they leftby train and they only could takea little knapsackand som e 
water.
 
And Hava andher m other were very si ck.
 
My f ather helped them to take them  to the 
tr
ain.
 
I know she didn'tm ake it.
 
Itka ,I do n 't kno w.
 
 
I remember Hava second names.
 
I put amemo 
--
 
in  Mia m i 
there is a m onum ent f or 
children, childrenare climbing toescape.
 
An d I  p ut  he r  n am e.
 
Because I knew
 
--
 
I  f ou nd  ou t 
thedate she is born and I knew the second nam e.
 
Itka, I could not rem ember her second 
name.
 
You cannot give just thef irst nam e.
 
 
I remember them  well.
 
W e were very good friends.
 
W e played together.
 
W hat did we 
play?
 
A lady m adef rom  sheets little dolls andf rom a pencil shem ade the eyes and clothes.
 
Andall three little girls were baby
-
sitting the little brother who was sick in the crib.
 
W e played 
wit h  t h is .
 
T here were no schools.
 
And children didn't learn.
 
So m y sister, who was hold
 
--
 
ol d e
r,  
she taughtm ethe alphabet and the num bersandhow to sign m y nam e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So Dora was happy to educate you.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
She was ver y bright.
 
Shehelpedm e to learn at leastthe basics.
 
 
So now we are com ing
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I ' m g
oing to ask youone more thing.
 
You described in your book
 
--
 
ref e rre d t o  
thedeportations as wedding invitations.
 
In the book, that was the phrase that was used.
 
Somebody got a wedding invitation.
 
It was the order.
 

12
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
And once thepeople
 -- 
som epeople wanted to go because the situation in 
the ghetto was sobad, they thoughtm aybe they going to go to otherfactories.
 
That's what the 
Germ an propaganda announced
: 
we going to send you to factories
;  
you're going to have more 
food.
 
W e hadno ideawhat was happening in Germany.
 
W edidn't have no radios.
 
T hey took 
ever ything awa y, f irst our valuables andthen
 
--
 
onefam ily they f ound a radio and they tookthe 
whole fam ily, the grandm a, grandpa,theparents,and they killed them  right there.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:
 
Because they hada radio.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Sopeople were af raid.
 
If people had radios, they just broke 
i n t o 
pieces and 
threw them away.
 
So we didn't know what was happening in Germany.
 
 
My f ather felt he didn't know what was happening.
 
S o  it  s c
ared him not knowing.
 
So  
he stayed as long as he could stay.
 
Luckily they needed people to cleanupthe belongings 
f rom  thepeople who left, I'm  talking 1944.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothepeople that were deported,they wantedto clean up all of their 
belongings
.  
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he Germ an wanted
 
--
 
there was beautif ul furniture people lef tand clothes.
 
Ever ything was sent to Germany.
 
There wasonetrain still working.
 
T he people, likem y father 
andm other, were chosen to stay and do thatwork.
 
B u t  wh
en he looked, theGerman leader 
--
 
m aybe you heardhis nam e
.  
Ihate to say hisname.
 
He just looked at me and he said," She 
cannot work"  and used ver y bad language.
 
And you have to go left.
 
L ef t  wa s  t o go .
 
Righ t  wa s  
to  sta y.
 
T hey put 800people in two f actories.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothis is the800 rem aining Jews.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
The ghettobecamea ghost town.
 
Everybo dy lef t.
 
A nd  I  r em em b er  t h e 
summ er tim e.
 
People lef t their window open.
 
You couldn't walk on the street because it was 

13
 
 
e m p t y.
 
But every m orni
ng, the800 people went to work, assigned streets, went to clean up, 
put them  on horse and buggy, and took the belongings to atrain.
 
 
Now, we supposed togo butm y father went to thisfactory and he saw there was a 
basem ent there.
 
He decided
 
--
 
I was alre
ad y a  b i g gi r l .
 
He says, I am  not going,m y nameis on 
the list,and I will put my Syl via in thebasem ent.
 
Andhisf riend heard about and they looked at 
him  he's crazy
; y
ou're all going to get killed.
 
He says, I have af eeling, a prem onitiontodo this.
 
I 
cannottell you what to do but if  you want to, you canput your child.
 
So his brother, m y 
co u
sin, who lives now inToronto, Jack,hisf ather listened to m y f ather and he put him
 
--
 
and 
he was a younger child than me.
 
I was watching over him .
 
And other peop
le .
 
 
So Iactually didn't remem ber how m any children,m aybe 11,m aybe13.
 
So I put in the 
book 12.
 
And we stayed there.
 
Andevery m orning they went to work andthey used to
 
--
 
it  wa s  
in the sum mer.
 
T he garden had vegetables.
 
They created a kitchen in the 
c am p.
 
T he wom en 
cooked.
 
And in the sum mer we hadall of those vegetables.
 
Used to f ind in the room s any food 
they broughtback to the cam p.
 
And the wom en cooked.
 
 
Af ter a while the Germansfound out about us 12 children.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That were hidden in the cellar.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T hey cam e to the cellar and told usf ollow them  in that house where the 
Germ an lived.
 
T hey talked.
 
I couldn'tunderstand at that time what they were sayin g.
 
Af ter a 
while, they sent usback to theparents.
 
And the parents 
were so happy to see the children 
b a ck.  
Littledid we know that they were planning to kill everyone.
 
A couple of days af ter they 
tookall the men in the cem etery anddig three big holes.
 
And the men knew when they came 
f rom  wo rk
 
--
 
they were sad, this is f
or us.
 
Bu t stil
l m y f ather couldn'tbelieve it;
 
they are going to 
k ill u s  o n e t ime .
 

14
 
 
 
At that tim e we were only 745.
 
Some peoplepassed away.
 
W e could hear already the 
bombings f alling.
 
W e were happy.
 
W esaw little tiny plane in the sky, like toys.
 
W e d i dn
't know 
f rom  what country they were.
 
T hen slowly they were com ing down and thebom bs started to 
f a ll.
 
W e could hear.
 
 
So oneday thebom bs were really f alling close soeverybody decided to gof rom the 
two f actories to lay on the ground.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Wh
ile the bombs
 
--
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he bom bs were falling.
 
W ethought maybe they would hit the building and 
we were going to lay.
 
So we lay on our stomach, for som e reason.
 
I know next tom y m other, 
andthe bom bs were falling all around.
 
Suddenly we saw this light up f rom the sky came, like it 
was daytim e.
 
 
W efoundout later onRussia liberated us.
 
So one cam e toour camp, saw all of  those 
people.
 
He was in theplane,W
ho are those people?
 
And we were wearing the yello w star on 
the back.
 
And they realized they were Jewish people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothis is one of the pilots in the Russian planes? 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T hat's why they didn't throw on thef actories bom bsbecausethey realized 
that we were Jewish people laying there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I ' m  go i n g 
t o  go  ba c k  a  lit t le b it if I  c an ,  S ylvia .
 
You told me about your f ather 
rescuing a cousin of yours, Mena.
 
T hat is such an astonishing thing.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
He helped.
 
Her father and another m an
 
--
 
m y father wasn't theonly person.
 
T hey neededto walk 
on  t he  s t r e et .
 
W hen they took the children, they put them  in the hospital.
 
It was a big building.
 
Andf rom  that hospital trucks were com ing andwould take them  to the 
train.
 
My aunt couldn'tf ind
 
--
 
they f ound her in ahutand took away.
 
That was the only 

15
 
 
daughter.
 
She cam e to our apartm ent crying help,helpme, to m yf ather, they took Mena.
 
And 
he gotpapers they could walk on the street.
 
How do you get tothe hospital?
 
The Germans see 
you.
 
It's a ghost town.
 
 
So thefather knew som ebody who was cleaning the chimney.
 
Andshe was m y age 
but she was very tin y little girl.
 
T hey went to the building.
 
He said Ihave to clean the chim ney.
 
T hey took her out inabasket.
 
She lives now close to New York Cit y.
 
She survived.
 
 
But in1944,they were sentout with other people to leave the ghetto.
 
And they really 
could stay with the800 people butthey decidedm aybe it'sbetter over there.
 
Luckily when they 
arrived in Germ any
 
--
 
not in Auschwit z.
 
Because they were taken away.
 
T hey assigned my 
aunt and her with gypsies in a camp with gyp sies.
 
And gypsies were  allowed to keepone child.
 
So that'show she survived.
 
It wasn't a long tim e when she was liberated by theAmericans.
 
I 
think Am erican or English.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thanks for telling usabout that.
 
 
Bef ore you were li
berated, Syl via
, when you were describing in
 
thecellar with the 
other 11 children
,  
what do you rem em ber what it was like for you tobe in the cellar with just 10 
otheror 11 other kids while your parents arebeingf orced to do thework they were doing?
 
>>
 
Syl via Rozines:
 
W e had to keep quiet.
 
The parents were bringing us thef ooddown in the 
evening when they cam e f rom  work.
 
It wasn't easy because som e children couldn't stay quiet.
 
But we were not therea long time.
 
I r e m em b er
 
--
 
I don'teven rem ember week
s.  
Right away 
the Germansfound us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ill yo u  t e ll u s
 
--
 
before we go back tothat.
 
At som e point in the cellar you 
dec
ided to com eout.
 
And this is the story with a p
ear
. 

16
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Oh .
 
Af ter they f ound us
,  
they decided to put us to
 
wo r k .
 
And the Germ ans 
lived in a place where there were gardens.
 
There were pears.
 
I was alm ost 10 and the other 
children were maybe 9, 10, 11, 12.
 
First they m ade us bring up coalf rom  the cellar to warm 
their oven.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This isyour job as 
kid s. 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
My job.
 
T hat was not an easy job because it was wintertim e.
 
But then they 
said pick thepears.
 
And the pears, as we picked, we could eat.
 
But Isaw other children taking 
a pear or two hiding behind the clothes and Isaid I would like to bring back tothe cam pform y 
sist e r.  
I was petrif ied if they opened m y coat andm y pocket if they f oundthe pears 
but  f ina lly I  
decided to do it.
 
 
Som any children arewriting m e letters when they readm y book.
 
I have hundreds and 
hundreds of  lette
rs .
 
And I have even apicture of  a child, young student,of  thetree, how I 
picked the pear and hide the pear
; h
ow brave I was to steal that pear for m y sister.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And kids are writing you about that.
 
Absolutely.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
Ye s .
 T
he pear, mostly
 
--
 
it's ver y im portantto them, thattim e when I 
took that pear.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Also,Iwould like you share with the audience,before the bombing occurred, I 
believe, and bef ore you were liberated, while you were still hiding you ended up
 
hiding very 
close to where the Germ ans' off ices were, where they were headquartered.
 
T ellus about that.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
W henthe mendig the holes, we knew they going to kill us next day.
 
So the person who wa s in charge of the 800people openedthe door and they said go hide 

yourselves.
 
W here can you hide yourself?
 
It was January
, s
now up to the knee.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And horribl y cold, brutal winter.
 

17
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Empty houses.
 
So m yf ather decided
 
--
 
he was very, very sm art to do this
,  
to choose the houseacross f rom the Germ ans.
 
Hef igured they going to go house
-
to
-
house 
andthat's the lasthouse they going to
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Theone right next to their headquarters.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
And we were there maybe three,four days.
 
I  r em em be r  m y m ot h e r o nly 
could takeone bread.
 
W e were cold.
 
W e couldn'tm ake any f ire.
 
Becausethe Germ an would 
see the sm oke.
 
So we stayed quiet there.
 
And the bombs were falling louderand louder.
 
And 
we knew that any day m aybe we would be liberated.
 
 
T hen 
one day we saw a lady walking, a blond lady, on the street.
 
T he other people 
said let's goout
; 
we are f ree.
 
But m yf ather said let's wait,m aybe she's adecoy.
 
Maybe we are 
not
a
nd the Germ an wantus to com eout.
 
But it was the liberation.
 
And we cam eout
. 
 
Af ter we came out,the bom bs weref alling.
 
W e almost got killed.
 
My father managed 
to get a horse and buggy and we went back to our camp where our clothes were.
 
W e were 
staying on the street, watching the Polish people carryin g our belongings.
 
W e didn't
 
have tim e 
to clean up all theapartm ent.
 
So they were carr ying the clothes or som efurniture.
 
 
And itdidn't occurto us go back right away to see if  you can
 
--
 
we had nothing but we 
were so happy to be liberated.
 
And som eof  the Russian major anda colonel cam e and talked 
to us.
 
W hatever they had
 
--
 
they had some chocolate.
 
T hey saw the children.
 
T hey gave us the 
chocolate.
 
And all thefoodthey had they gave it to us.
 
And they said, " You are the f irst Jewish 
people we liberated but now we're going to take Berlin."
 
And that colonel was very wor ried 
because it was very hard to takeBerlin.
 
Many soldiers died.
 
Andhewas telling, " I have two 
children in Moscow and I hope I can goback."
 
I  r em em be r  t h i s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You rem em ber him saying that.
 

18
 
 
>> S y l vi a
 
Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
He was ver y nice.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You explained tome when we firsttalked that as happy as you were with 
liberation, you saidpeopleeven began
 
--
 
you got chocolates, people began to dance,butyou 
said the jubilation was short
-
lived when your father
 
--
 
and youputthis in your book

told you 
the horrible news.
 
Do you rem em ber?
 
Yourf ather said there are noJews lef t.
 
A n d it  re a lly

T hat's what we thought.
 
T hat's what we thought.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That'swhat you thought
. 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Everybody thought we were the only ones left and we all started to cry.
 
W e 
the only ones.
 
But we didn't know what was happening inother countries.
 
Un t il we  s a w
 
--
 
af t e r  
we f ound an apartm ent
 
--
 
Russia said you can get any apartmentf rom  Germ an lived in that 
c i t y.
 
W e ll,  t h e y lef t .
 
And you can open the concierge and you areallowed to live there.
 
W e 
found a niceplay place with nicef urniture.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W henyou went back to your own apartment to seewhat was lef t

>> S y l vi a  
Rozines:
 
T here was nothing lef t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You f ound

we saw som ephotographs.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Yeah, the photographs.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A few photographs.
 
Tell us about the photographs.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he photographs were laying on thef loor.
 
W e had two big pictures, m y 
sister and I.
 
Becausethef ram es were so beautif ul, they took.
 
And they m ust have just threw

>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he photograph was on thefloor and they stepped so som eare damaged.
 
T hey are here atthe Holocaust museum .
 
T he m useum  gave m e very nice copies.
 
And m y son 
is still angry at m e why I gave away the origin al.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That'sthe reason you have thosefew photographs.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
W e couldn't f ind
 
--
 
the f urniture w
as gone.
 
Ever ything was gone.
 
T he  
Polish people took the furniture.
 
Because we were cleaning, we didn't want to cleanour own 
place, we lef t them  so maybe after the war we could com ebackthere.
 
But we never went back 
to live in that ghetto.
 
W e could live where ver we wanted.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you ended up deciding to not stay in Polandforver y long.
 
T ell us why.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
W e wanted
 
--
 
m yf ather starteda good business.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So he started to work again.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
He opened up 
his own business.
 
He was selling wholesale sugar andf lour 
and we did very well.
 
W e got new clothes.
 
W e had food.
 
Everything was going pretty good till 
som e people started again com ing at
 
nightand killing us, certain Polish people.
 
 
F in a lly
 
--
 
I rem em berm y f ather was saying we sur vi ved and now we are going to get 
k ille d .
 
So we decided one nightto leave that apartment but we couldn't take a suitcase.
 
W e 
were af raidthe Polishpeople would see usand can report to the other people who were doin
g 
those bad things.
 
And the concierge watchedyou com ing inand out.
 
So we just put clothes on 
and coats and we hidm oney

 w

--
 
in our clothes
 
and  
putm aybedoubleblouse and took thepictures and papers into the clothesbecause it was

>> Bill Benson:
 
That'sall you took, nothing else.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
My father says if  they see us carrying a package
 
--
 
because in theevening, 
that was the style.
 
People wentf or walks.
 
And we went to the trainstation.
 
It wa s 
already dark.
 

20
 
 
W e went to theborderof  Germ any.
 
W e weregoing to go to Germ any.
 
W e hired som eonewith 
a truck who was delivering

>> Bill Benson:
 
Gasoline.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Yes, gasoline.
 
He hid us behind.
 
He wentthrough the woods.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He

>> Syl via Rozines:
 
W e were f ive people.
 
Ourunclealso lived with us.
 
He didn't go to

Since then I have m otion sickness.
 
And the sm ell is horrible.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You said tom ethat getting gas at a gas stationbrings back

makes you 
nauseouseven to thisday, the sm ellof  that.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s, I rem em b e rth at.
 
 
W earrived on the Am erican side.
 
Berlin was divided.
 
There was displaced persons 
c a m p.
 
And the soldiers, MPs, directedus where to go.
 
They gave us shotsnot to be sick.
 
And 
that was aplace where they assigned you where to go.
 
And then they assigned you a place to 
go near Munich.
 
And we stayed there.
 
 
T hey m ade schools there
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In the displaced persons 
c am p .
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Yeah.
 
And we had plenty of  f ood.
 
And even some people
 
--
 
clothes were 
sent,peoplef rom America, Jewish people sent lotsof  their clothes.
 
And lif e startedagain.
 
T here were dances.
 
 
But m y father became restless.
 
H e  sa ys

>> Bill Benson:
 
Ina large displaced persons cam p, refugee cam p, essentially.
 

21
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Yeah.
 
Andthe place where we stayed, Nazis, schoolsfor them.
 
So we had 
showers.
 
It wa s qu ite  m o

Som eof  the cam ps were not as nice.
 
 
W e found out
 
--
 
m y m other hada brother in Paris, France.
 
My parents m adethe 
decisionto go to France, but we hired someone to take us.
 
W e hadto pay som eone
,  
a young 
French m an
,  
to take us to theborder.
 
A nd  
this tim e we were walking.
 
W hen I watch television, 
I seethe ref ugees walking, it rem inds me we were walking like this.
 
And we arrived in Paris.
 
W estayed with m y uncle for a while.
 
 
And then it was starting a new language.
 
I went to French school.
 
And the children 
were so nice.
 
T he teachers were so nice.
 
I was theonly child who was not speaking French 
there.
 
And I was very e m barrassed because in orderto learn how to read they had to putm e 
for a couple of hours with 6 years olds.
 
But they put me ina classroom  with m y age
, t
he grade 
I should have been.
 
But I learned
 
--
 
you're young, you learn the language.
 
It's a beautif ul 
language.
 
And I was very happy.
 
I made f riends.
 
 
Another tragedy happened.
 
My m other diesf rom  cancer whenI was 16.

W hileyo u  we re  s t ill in  P a ris ?

In Paris.
 
Andm y older sister was already in America
 w

Because they had relatives in Am erica.
 
Hismother was actually born in Am erica.
 
B ut  t he  
parents went back and hehad lotsof  relatives.
 
They sent papers.
 
She loved itthe m inuteshe

She startedtotalk to us to sendpapers for us.
 
And in betweenm y m other passed 
away so she came back to take care of me becauseI was ver y, ver y sick, depression, losing 
m y m om  at 16 af ter we surviv

>> Bill Benson:
 
Af ter going through so much.
 

22
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
It took a long tim e,f ive years, to geta visa because we were born in 
Poland.
 
In 1957 m yf ather and I cam e to Am erica.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you had to startover again.

Another language.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Another language to learn.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Ye s .
 
And Iam  very happy that I cam e to Am erica.
 
T his is the best thing 
what we did.
 
I think Am erica is still the bestcountry to live.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sylvia, I think we have 
tim e for som e questions f rom  our audience.
 
And if we 
don'thave questions in theaudience, Ihavem any morefor you.
 
But I think we're going to turn 
to our audience and see if  you have some questions.
 
W e do have tim efor that.
 
W e're going to ask you to please remain through the questionand answer period becauseto 
close our program ,Sylvia wil l share with us som e last thoughtsf or today.

An d  
then Sylvia wi ll respond to your question.
 
 
So we welcom e anybody who is onthe internet, if  it'spossible to ask a question, I

 O k.  
One 
of  the students wants to know, How long did it take you

your experiences f rom  the Holocaust?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soone of  the students at theelementary school is asking how long did it take 
you tof eel comf ortable enough to share whatyou went through during the Holocaust.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
It took me a long time.
 
I am  here 60 years in America but I started, I would 
say, like f ive years ago speaking to children.
 
I t  wa s
 
easier f or m e to speak to children
,  si

and seventh graders in Montgomery County, in Maryland.
 
T hen I spoke to groups of wom en.
 
Little by little, I was asked to volunteer atthem useum .
 
And I saidIwould try.
 
I wa s a t the  
Inf orm ation Desk in the beginn

And now I'm  sitting at the desk and people com e tom eto

So it took me a long time.
 
Form any years I didn't talk about it.

And he watched with m e.
 
A n d t hen

He knew a little bitabout itbuthedidn't know exactly

And believe m e,now he knows m ore than I what was

W ehave a question there I see inthe back.
 
>>
 
I just wanted to know, 
D
id you have any otherfam ily that was out of  the country other than 
Poland? 
 

24
 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did you have any other fam ily I think who survi ved and wenttoother countries.
 
Wh
oelse in yourf am ily sur vi ved?
 
A m I ge tting th a t righ t?
 
 
T hank you.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
I had thisuncle in Paris.
 
And Ihad another uncle in Romaniaand he 
survi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But that large, extended family.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he other ones, when they were sent
 
--
 
som e  of m y co u sin s cam e b a ck.
 
T hey were sent toAuschwitz
, i
n different camps.
 
But that was 
`
44and they were liberated 
`
45.
 
So they were not like years.
 
Some people spent
 
--
 
I have a brother
-
in
-
law who was in 
Auschwitz three years.
 
He  ju
st passed away.
 
But the youngest
 
--
 
som eof  the cousins survived 
but the parents, no, no.
 
Them inute you looked a little bitolder, youwent right awa y to thegas 
chamber.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ehave another one here I think.
 
>>
 
You said that you were with other childrenin a cellar, in an internm ent camp.
 
W ere you 
able to reconnect with any of  the other children later in your lif e?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From the displaced persons cam p or inthe cellar? 
 
>>
 
Either is f ine.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ere you able to reconnect at any point with any of the children that you were 
with in the cellaror even later when you werein the displacedpersons camp? 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
T he sad part isI couldn't because they stayed in the DP cam pand we lef t.
 
At that tim e it never occurred to me to take their address.
 
Because all of thosepeople were 
going to diff erent countries and we didn't keep in touch.
 

25
 
 
 
My t wo little gir lf riends, they passedaway.
 
But in DP camp, peoplewere com ing and 
going so I didn't have closef riends.
 
But thetwo little closef riends, they didn't survive.
 
T he 
m inute they arrived with the mother, they never separated them otherf romthe child.
 
W hen a 
m other was holding achild, they alwa ys putyou
 
--
 
the Germ ans didn't like chaos.
 
There would 
be crying and scream ing.
 
T hem other went,even when she was young and could work, they 
put them otherand to the gas chambers,andthe child.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Any other questions? Youhave a couple of m inutes to think about it.
 
 
Syl via, I want to ask you
 
--
 
[off  m ic] 
 
 
T hank you.
 
 
W ith your niece, Jennifer Roy, you wrote your m em oir," Yellow Star" .
 
Tell us about the 
bookand what itm eant f or you to write thatbook.
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
Mo s t
 
--
 
we m et one tim e,because she lives upstate New York and I 
live
 
--
 
and m ostly we did it on the telephone.
 
Andevery tim e she wrote a chapter, she used to 
send m e.
 
For some reasonI can tell m y story but reading thebook is ver y hard form e.
 
S o  I 
startedto cry reading the chapter.
 
So many things are a little bit wrong but it'sm y fault.
 
I  n e ve
r 
read the chapter and I said that it'sok because I couldn't.
 
Even when the book came out, I 
read it
 
--
 
thisbook youcan read in two hours.
 
I said tom yself
 
I should read it again.
 
I have a 
hard tim e when it's written down to read
b
ut yet I'm  okto talk 
ab o ut  it .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Incidentally, it is a m arvelousbook, " Yellow Star" .
 
 
Is my memory corr
ect that you were with us with 
F i rs t  P
e r s on
 
one other time, two 
years ago, and I think there was a lady in theaudience who had read your book 22 times.
 
>> S y l
via Rozines:
 
Ye s ,  a  lit t le  girl.
 
She was only 8 years old.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That's right!
 
8 years old, shehad read it 22 times. 
 

26
 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
And she was so shy.
 
She couldn't askme questions. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
I think we have another question.
 
Ye
s,  sir?
 
>>
 
T hank you f or your tim e.
 
You were persecutedf or your religion when you were younger.
 
How has your f aith changed over the years?
 
W ere youabletopractice in France and how is 
your f aith now here in Am erica?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were persecuted because of  yourfaith.
 
How is your f aith today?
 
W hat has 
changed, if  anything, with respect to yourf aith? 
 
>> Syl via Rozines:
 
W hen I was a little girl
,  
I didn't know m uch aboutreligion because the 
ghetto was almost six years.
 
So I was not educated and m y parents didn'thave tim e to teach 
m e.
 
Inthe beginning whenI heard Jewish, I didn't know what it meant.
 
W hat  i t  m e an ?
 
W hy am 
I persecuted because I'm  Jewish?
 
But when Icam e really to Am erica, I startedtopractice 
Jewish religion.
 
And Ido practice right
 
now.
