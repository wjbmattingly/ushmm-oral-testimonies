. 
George, or Gyorgy in Hungarian, Pick was born March 28,1934 inBudapest, Hungary to 
Istvan and Margit Pick.  Hungary is highli ghted on thism ap of Europe in 1933.  Istvan was an 

engineer and Margit was a legal secretary.  Pictured here are Istvanand Ma
rgit wit h  t h e ir 

newborn son Gyorgy.  Here we see George and histwo cousins ina m iniature horse

T his isa Mother's Day card that George made in thef irst grade.  And here is George with 
his non
-
Jewish neighbors in 1943.  After Hungar y allied itself  with Nazi Germ any Istvan and 
Margit lost their jobsdue to
 
new la ws restricti ng the participationof Jews in the econom y.  
Istvan was then conscripted intothe Hungarian labor battalions.  Germ an troops occupied 
Hungary in March 1944 and the Pickfam ily wasf irstf orced to move into buildings markedwith 

the yellow star, like that seen in this photo. Thatfall thef am ily went into hiding.  But the Pick 

fam ily was discovered, the children were taken, and George was placed ina home with 500 

other children. George and another boy escapedand went back totheir hiding place where 

George was reunitedwith his parents. T wo weeks later the entirefam ily was sent to the ghetto.  

T hey were liberatedf rom  the ghettoby the Soviets in January 1945. In this 1946photograph, 

we see George with agroup of  survi vors, all of  whom  thePickf am ily had been in hiding with.  

T he circle is on George.  Following the war George lived in Hungary where he earned adegree 

in engineering until late 1956 whenheescapedf rom  Hungary andm ade his way to the United 

States to live with his uncle in New Jersey.  After working as laborerGeorge got a scholarship 

for an intensive English language courseatTem ple University in Philadelphia.  He then went to 

work f orW estinghouse as an engineer.  George would later teachengineering at the Cathol
ic  
Universit y of  Am erica here inthe District of  Columbia. Af ter earning his Ph.D. he workedfor the 

US Navy as anaerospace engineerf rom 1966 to1995, retiring f rom federal service as a 

technical directorat Navy headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia.
 
W hile George continues to do consulting work, a greatdealof his time is spent working on 
two books.  He recently com pleted hisautobiography and is currently looking f or a publisher. 

T he second is a scholarly work about the history of  40 Jewish com munities in a particular 

region of  Hungary thathe is currently writing. 
 
George and his wife Leticia Flores Pick, who retiredf rom  the Mexican Foreign Service, 
live in Arlington, Virgini a. George perform s several roles as a volunteer here at the museum .

W ith  th a t 
I would like to ask you to join me inwelcom ing our First Person, Mr.
 
G eo r ge  
P ick.  
(Applause) 
 
>> George Pick: T hank you, thank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, thank you som uchfor joining us today and your willingness to 
be our First Person. An hour is such a short tim e andI know you have just so muchto share 

with us so we'll start right away.  George, you were nearly f our anda half years old when 

Germ any invaded Poland in Septem ber1939, beginningW orldW ar II. T ell us about your 

3 
 
fam ily and your community in the years that led up to the war andto the Holocaust. 
 
>> George Pick:  My f am ily has ties and rootsin what then was called the 
A u s t ro
-
HungarianEmpire.  And Ihave documentationthat roughly two and ahalf  centuries ago 
was the time that thefam iliesm oved into this area.W e were partof or at leastm y 
grandparents and great grandparents were part of the em ancipatedJewish com munity.  Not 

ve r y,  ve r y, j u s t
 
--
 
but Jewish nevertheless, and they kept the cultural roots of course.  Mostof  
m y f am ily
 
m em bersf rom  the prof essionals,engineers, lawyers, doctors, businessmenandthe 
extendedf am ily li ved all around the Em pire.Places where now is what we would think isthe 

Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic andRom ania andSerbiaand Austria. Sono
t  a ll of  

thefam ily lived in what is now
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat is now
 
--
 
>> George Pick:  Geographically in Hungary.  Now all m y grandparents camef rom large 
f a m ilie s ,  9
 
to 12 children so.
 
T he extendedf am ily was quite large.  Over 200 people. I did so
m e genealogical survey 
andIf ound roughly about 150 relatives uptothe second cousin level.  And during thef irstworld 

war m y grandfathers and their brothers have served with distinctionin the Austrian Hungarian 

Arm y, m ost of them as officers. And many of them  earned medalsf or their valor.  However,  

thatdidn't help them after the Austro
-
Hungarian Em pire lost the war.  Hungarian was chopped 
up to many little pieces.  The original Hungarian territory was all
 
--
 
what they call the
 
--
 
t h e 
Hungarian historical land was lost roughly two thirdsof  them  was lost to Romania,the 

C ze c h
 
--
 
C zechoslovakia Republic, Serbia, Croatia,and soforth.  And so m y relatives all of a 
sudden f rom
 
--
 
being in one country, now live d in one in three orfour countries.  And after this 
catastrophic war for Hungary, Hungary becam ea sm all stateandthe
 
--
 
o ne  of  t he  
consequencesof  thiswas the rise of anti
-
sem itism . T he Jews wer e in m any places throughout 
history the scapegoats of  all thebad things which had happened with coun
tries or people or 

places. Sothe Hungarians were again blam ed, and the very f irst anti
-
Jewish law in Europe 
tookplace in Hungary in 1921. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ellpredating the Nurem burg laws.
 
>> George Pick: W ellbef ore even Hitler arose.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> George Pick:  And this particular law excluded Jewish studentsf rom higher education.  
More precisely what this law did, and it's called Numerus Clausus, is to say that the Jews are 

5% of the population so the people who are in higher institutions wil l have tobe5%.  Now, 

realize that the Jews were very well represented inthesef ields, particularly the law andm edical 

f ields,m orethan 50%of the students were Jewish.  So
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatm eant they had to be shrunk back to 5%
. 
>> George Pick:  Correct. And,f orexam ple, I had an uncle who was m y m other's brother, 
older brother,and hewas studying m edicine.  He was in third year in one of the larger medical 

schoolsandthey kicked him out, physically, n ot justhim but many of
 
the other students.  And 
their only way of  continuing studies was to goabroad. And this is whatm y uncle did.  He went 

to Italy and it tookhim  eight years bef ore hewas able tof inish his studiesand becam ea 

f u ll
-
f l ed ge d
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your mother, who had had som e legal training
 
--
 
>> George Pick:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
--
 
oneof  the reasons she worked,however, was related to your uncle.  
T ell us a little bitaboutthat.
 

4 
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah.  W ell, m y motherf inishedher training at age
 
16and went to work 
as a secretary andmost of her salary went to her brothers,the older brother who was studying 
in Italy and the younger brother who was studying in Germ any.  Hewas an optometrist, so he 

becam eanoptometrist.  So it was expectedthat 
the m en in the f am ily would get the higher 

educationand the wom en would only get asm uch as comm ercial.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat she was working to help pay for their education.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct. And she was working help their education. And m y unc
l e 
eventually, he went through various countries and eventually endedup in Hungary.  It was ver y 

hardfor a Jewish physician tof ind a job. Andit was ver y f rustratingfor him.  And of course, the 

big depression alsohitHungary just like ever y other country in Europe, and so he
 
--
 
he was 
lookingf or a job very unsuccessfully.  He wor ked in jobs which didn't pay atall.
 
So by 1938he was able to immigrate tothe UnitedStates andthat'swhat he did.  And 
here he hada hard time but eventually hef inished whatever requirem ents were, got a license 

and he became a practice here
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Here if the United States. And of  course we don'thave time to talk about 
m any of  yourotherfam ily m embers, butboth not only highl y educatedbut some really 

s i gn
if icant people.  George was telling m e earlier that indoing researchf or his quantum physics 
course hefound a
 
--
 
arelative of his grandfather's who Einstein consultedover m athem atics to 
get hisf orm ulas correct.  And I'm m isphrasing that, I'm  sure.  An
d another relative team ed with 

D r.
 
Alzheim er's tohelp f ind Alzheimer's Disease and relateddem entia.  So, I mean, education 
was such a huge partof  yourf am ily.
 
George, while thefull brunt of the war would not com eto Hungary until 1944, the lives of  
Je w
s in Hungary inclu ding Budapest would change signif icantly once war began. Tell uswhat 
you can about your life, your fam ily's lif e, during those years af terthe war began in Europe but 

bef ore it really came to Hungary.
 
>> George Pick:  Okay.  W ell, Hungary was an ally of Germ anyf or political reasons 
and
 
--
 
but it was a 
--
 
they were a reluctantally. T hey wanted to be allied with the western 
countriesbut becauseof the unf ortunate geography, there was justno way to do it.  So they 

ended up being an ally of  Germ any.  And af ter 1933 when Hitler took power, of  course one of  

Hitler's big pogrom s was an anti
-
Jewish pogr om .  First they wantedto get rid of all the Jews 
and af ter the war began.  T hat pogrom  becam e an extermination or genocide pogrom.  So 

Hunga
ry had to, toa certain degree,follow this policy.  But just toacertain degree. And the 

f irst an ti
-
Jewish law wh ich was f airly com prehensive andagainst Jewish econom ic interests 
cam e topass in 1938. My f ather losthis jobbecause he was Jewis h andmany of m y uncles 

and soforth. Sothatwas thef irst blow.  Later the second Jewish
 
--
 
anti
-
Jewish law cam e into 
eff ect which had a
 
--
 
an addendum  which had essentially said thatpeople who were not 
trustworthy, nam ely the com munists, the socialists, and 
the Jews, would not be able to serve in 

the regular Arm y servi ce.  But they would have to serve in a label service where they would of  

course nothave weapons but they would have tools to
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Picks and shovels.
 
>> G e o rge  P ick:   P icks a n d sh
ovels and stuff  like that, to do thesetype of things.  Andm y 
father was am ong thever y f irst indoctrinatedin 1940,this was when I startedm y f irst 

elementary school education, he went tothenortheastern section of Hungary which is now part 

of  Ukraineand he andm any others were participating in doing constructionof  strategic roads 

actually.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they were takenoutof  their professions, whatever their professions 

5 
 
m ight be, and senttobuild roads and do really horrible things that they were forcedto do.
 
>> George Pick:  Right, yeah.  Now, im agine that these people were m ostly intellectuals.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .  
 
>> George Pick:  Engineers and soforth,and sophysically they we re not very wel l f itand 
they had todothis kind of  work.  Andof  course it was physically ver y, ver y bad.  Fortunately at 
thattim e the Christian soldiers who were supervisin g them , they we re still hum ane and they 

were not trying to kill them with the labor. T hey were working ver y hard butthey were still 

re s
pected as hum an beings.
 
And three months later m y father was decomm issioned andhe came back.  Now, the 
question was always o r I usually get the question so how did youm ake a living?
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas my next question,how do you makeends m eet?
 
>
> George Pick:  How do you m ake endsm eet? There were roughly 25,000 Jews of  
whom  probably 150,000 Jewish m en who wer e unemployed so how do youm ake a living.  

T here was a system  called "Strawm an"  or" Strohman"  in German,which m eans that there was 

a man,
  
a Christian person, who would take out a licensetodo business and thatperson would 
then take a Jew or two  under his license andon paper it looks like he was the employer and the 

Jews were the em ployees which was legal at that time. But inf act the Jews were gi ven money 

to thisperson who took outthe license and they did the work.  Andit was
 
--
 
I don't know why, 
you can probably call it a gray m arket,butas the war was com ing and then started, them arket 

turned out to be pretty good, if  you were in
 
the market. Now, Hungary had a very interesting 
story as far as the war was concerned. T hewar started Septem ber 1,1939, but the Hungarians 

were neutral until June of 1941.  So there was a window of tim e when people theoretically could 

get out.  So m y unclewho was already here
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: T he one you told us aboutearlier.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct, theone who was the doctor.W as trying to sendus papers to 
com e tothe United States.  Unfortunately, becauseof  the UnitedStates' policy, we got
 
to  
th e
 
--
 
on the waiting lis t and we were going to beableto come no earlier than1943, whichwas 
entirely too late.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> George Pick:  Of  course.  And so we got stuck there. And in 19
 
--
 
in 1941
-
'42, when 
thefull brunt of the genocide,the Holocaust already hit Polandand Czechoslovakia and other 

countries, didnot hitus.  And the reason why not, because of the regent of  Hungary, who was 

Horthy, refused toprovide the Germ ans with the Hungarian Jews.  But we had som e relatives 

fr
om  Austriaand Slovakia m ainly who were able to com e to Hungary legall y and we ga ve them 
shelter and illegal papers and they were able to providefor themf or two years until 1944 when 

the Germans came in. They lived in
 
--
 
as illegal aliens in Hungary.
 
Now, they were telling us about ghettos and concentration cam psand deportations, and 
we looked
 
--
 
looked atthem  and listened to them , but we were absolutely convinced that it 
could never happen
 
>> Bill Benson:  Not inHungary.
 
>> George Pick:  Not in Hungary because Hungary is just Hungarians, it's justdiff erent 
f rom  everybody else.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though they had had these stringent anti
-
Jewi sh laws, thebelief  
was they would not goto thoseextrem es.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct.  Correct.  And so som ehow we m ade ends m eet. And in 
1943
 
--
 
in 1942the Hungarians, asIm entioned,f inally joined the war and they were told by 

6 
 
Hitler to put together an Arm y.  And they did that in the summ er of 1941.  And also Jewish m en, 
50,000of  them , were brought in
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T o the labor battalions.
 
>> George Pick:  For the labor battalions, right.  My father was fortunately a year older 
t h a n t he  20
-
40 year
 
--
 
years and so he didn't get in there. Butm any of m y uncles and cousins, 
second cousins, did. And they were takento the Ukraine. And theHungarian
 
--
 
this was in the 
summ er of 1941
-
' 42 .
 
>> Bill Benson:  '42.
 
>> George Pick: T heHungarians were not very anxious to get involved in there.  And 
they didn't think that it
 
--
 
the war is going to last so long.  And sothe
 
--
 
both the HungarianArm y 
andthe laborbattalions were ver y poorly equ ipped, particularly theclothesfor the Russian 

winter.  And so thousands of people of  course died,f rozen to deathandbeaten todeath.
 
By then the Hungarianlabor battalions were led by rather Nazi sym pathizers and people 
who were told that you could come home assoonas the last Jew is dead. So it gave them  a 

great
 
--
 
som e sort of agreat emotional support to kill Jews.  And youcould read today in m any 
books the best
iality which was used on thesepeople. I losta couple of  unclesand second 
cousins also there.
 
In January of  1943 there was a catastrophiceventf or both the Germ an Arm y and the 
Hungarian Arm y, particularly when the Germ ans lost Stalingrad andthe Soviets had a 

counteroffensive and part of thef ront
-
line troops were Hungarian, and the Soviets just rolled 
over them.  And150,000 people were killed or captured inf ive days of f ighting in Voronezh 

which was on the eastern part
 
of  
--
 
or western partof  the Don River.  And of the 50,000 Jewish 
laborer, roughly 42,000 were killed.  And only about5,000 survived com ing back.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And for you, George, still you're young, the war was still som ewhatdistant 
f rom  you. You described to me an incident that
 
you experienced with your m om ,I believe, in 
1943 that was your f irst kind of  personal realsenseof  the
 
--
 
will you tell us about that?
 
>> George Pick:  Sure.  My f ather was inducted again '43
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T his time his age didn'tm atter.
 
>> G e o r g
e Pick:  His age didn't m atter thatmuch. Andf or threemonthshe was working 
in
 
--
 
again in construction site som ewhere inT ransylvania and af terhe cam e back we decided 
to have a very short va cation.  Jews couldeven have vacations there, which is unbel
ievable 
becausem ost of the Jewish com munities inEurope were already dead.
 
So we went outand my m otherand I at onepoint walked in a little
 
--
 
we went on a f airly 
nice hotel, in ahotel, and we were walkin g and we saw a group of people, Nazis, who wer e 
in  

the Hungarian Nazi uniform  and they were sin ging and yelling Na zi sl ogans.  Andthey looked 

pretty m uch a wild bunch, and we were quite f rightened. T hat was thef irst timeI have seen 

any kind of groups that are recognizably Nazi
 
>> Bill Benson:  Is that what is known as theArrow Cross?
 
>> George Pick:  Yes,correct. T he Arrow Cr oss had black uniform s with green shirts and 
they were eventually
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Hungarianfascist.
 
>> George Pick:  T he Hungarian f ascists.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you 
know
 
--
 
I m ean, as you said, you hadpeople that were ref ugees 
com ing inand telling what they
 
--
 
what they had experiencedor knew.  Did you have a sense of  
what was going on in the war during that time,f or example,that theGermans had lost at 

S t a lin gra
d?  Did you know thosethings?
 

7 
 
>> George Pick: W e knew the Germ ans lostto Stalingrad becauseas I said the 
Hungarian Arm y was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: W as decim ated.
 
>> George Pick:  
--
 
was decimated so there was a periodof  Ithinkthreedays of  
m ourning.  So that was well
-
published.  Andof  course, we did not know what the contactfor the 
Jewish laborers but we figured mostof  them  had been buried and killed anddied.  So this was 
1943.  Andthen 1944cam e along
 
--
 
around,namely March of  1944.  Now, by 1943
 
even the 
high comm andof  theGerm ans knew that the war was lost.  And som e of them tried to kill Hitler.  

Inf act there were anumberof assassinationattem pts.  Noneof  them  were unfortunately 

successf ul.  And so the war went on.  In March of
 
--
 
March 19
 
t o  b egi n
 
--
 
to be exact of  1944, 
the German Arm y m arched into Hungary.  Now, the reason why they did that isthey knew that 

the Hungarians behind the
 
--
 
the curtains were talking to the Britishas well as theSoviets to 
switch sides or become neutral. And sothey no longer trusted theHungarians with reason.  

And so they found that Hungary, which was a strategic retreatf or them , could not be just lef t 

alone.
 
So they came in andthe partsof theSS, Hitler's group, particularly the groupof people 
who 
a re
 
--
 
who were in  charge of thefinal solution, all thisf rustrated by thefact thatthere 
wa s
 
--
 
there were still 825,000 Jews in Hungary, the largest group in Europeat that time
 
>> Bill Benson:  Had yet largely not be touched inthe sam e way as
 
--
 
>> G
eorge Pick:  Correct, exactly.  Sothef irst thing they did after they occupied Hungary, 
m aybefour orf ive days later, a small (inaudible) com mand they called it, came in,about120 

SS off icers, and their business was toorganize the quick deportation of the Jews.  And 

ever ything which had happened infour long years,f ive years and in Germany even ten years 

happened in weeks inHungary.  And sothef irst thing was that the Jews had to wear a yellow 

star.  It turnsout that itwas a ver y m em orable day for me because itwas aroundm y birthday, 

m y tenth birthday when I hadto wear the yellow star.  And thef irst thing they did
 
--
 
now, a new 
governm ent came to power in Hungary also, a pro
-
f ascist governm ent. And they already had 
their script. They knew precisel y what todoandhow fastand soforth.  So thef irst thing was to 

sever all comm unications and transportationsbetween theprovinces and the capital.  Mostof  

m y f am ily lived in the provinces.  From one day to another we couldn't telephone them , we 

co u
ldn't com municatewith them . And then Jews were not allowed to take trainsor even 
bicycles.  Inf act, bicycles and autom obiles were all conf iscated.  And so we had no idea what 

went on inthe provinces.  In Budapest we knew that there were dem ands on us 
in term s of  

gi ving e ver ything which was valuable tothe new f ascist governm ent.
 
Meanwhile in the provinces,already as early as April,m iddle of April, which was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just weeks after the Germans came in.
 
>> George Pick:  Justweeks, they had concentrated Jews and there were 
Je wish  
--
 
Je wish partsof  citiesand villages and they were concentrated in certain parts, usually 
the worst partof  the city.  And these were transit cam ps. And by the m iddleof May they started 

to deportthem .  And in six weeks 437,000 people were deported,over
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T oplaces like Auschwitz.
 
>> George Pick:  Mostly Auschwit z.  Mostly.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he num bers arealmost beg your im agination.  Almost 440,000 in six 
we e ks.  
>> G e o rge  P ick:   I n six we e ks
.  In146 trains. Imagine this is the

toward the endof  the 
war.  T hetrains obviously could be usedfor
 
--
 

8 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he war effort.
 
>> George Pick:  
--
 
the war eff ort. T hey would divert these trainsand use them  
exclusi vel y to deport these people. And thenthey got to Auschwitz, 90% of them  were killed in 
the gas cham bersandthen burned in the crem atorium .  In two or three hours.  They hadnew 

crem atorium builtfor this purpose, andevery day 12,000 HungarianJews were deported there 

and selected out. Andat onepoint the heatof the crematorium  was so big that one of them 

blew up because of the hum an bodies.  Andthen when they couldn't
 
--
 
couldn't burn them, they 
burned them in open pits.  And thereare
 
--
 
here in them useum there arepictures which show 
t h is .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And George,f or youand your parents, you're still in Budapest at that 
tim e. At som e pointI think the word you used was your f ather justdisappeared.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappened?
 
>> George Pick: W ell, I should say thataf ter
 
--
 
shortly af terthe Germ ans cam e in, all 
Jewish m en between the age of  20
 
--
 
16 actually and 60 were conf ined inthese cam ps, these 
labor cam ps.  My f ather was one of them .  And he moved tothe north of the
 
--
 
western 
edge of  
Hungary.  And he was doingf ortif icationsfor the Germ ans. And so in Budapest there were only 

m en, old men, young wom en, and children. T hat's it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Children.
 
>> George Pick:  It was still the largest community, roughly 160,000people there. And 
what happened theref irst was Budapest was 25% Jewish. T hey called them  Jewdapest 

actually.  And they wer e living all o ver the place.  So thef irst thing was to try to concentrate 

them . Butthey couldn't concentrate them  ina ghettobecause it would have taken too much 

tim e. So they concentrated people in certainhouses called Jewish houses. They hada big 

ye llo w s t a r
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Like you saw in the picture.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah, you saw the picture. And they were concentrating roughly 25% of  
thepopulation into 5%of the area. Our building was not designated as a Jewish building,so 

m y f ather
 
--
 
m y m other and m y grandmotherandm yself, we had tom ove in with relatives which 
we r e
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  In a so
-
called Jewish build
i ng.
 
>> George Pick:  In a so
-
called Jewish building.  Andthe rule was that you had to have 
four people per room  and so we m oved into a one
-
bedroom apartment plus each apartm ent at 
thattim e had a maid room , maid's room , so we had tenpeople inthis place
 
which would be 
te n
 
--
 
maybe 1,000 square feet area.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And ten people squeezed into that.
 
>> George Pick:  And ten people squeeze in. Now, lif e there is
 
--
 
was of  course quite 
cram ped. Inaddition,we only had two hoursa day where we coul
d go out and buy f ood.  And 
the two hours were in the afternoon where norm ally there were nofood inthe shops anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because it hadall been soldout.
 
>> George Pick:  Because it's all sold out. And in addition to that,many of  the 
sh o
pkeepers would refuse to sellfood to Jews.  So it was a very, very, ver y precarious 
situation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And at that sam e tim e, andonce the Germans occupiedandbegan the 
deportations, then the allies beganmajor bom bing of Budapest, right?
 
>>
 
George Pick:  Right. Well, what happened, of  course if anybody recalls the history, on 

9 
 
June 6, 1944, D
-
Day happened. And we wer e concentrated in these Jewish houses about two 
weeks later and sothat by July, f irst part of  July, the BritishandtheAmericans hadair bases in 
Italy, in France, and other places where they already were on the continent. Andf rom  there 

they had long distance bom bers.  So one thing which they did was on the 2ndof  July, whic h 

was only a week af terwe m oved intothis building,
 
which was a
 
--
 
what they called carpet 
bombing.  It was a thousand bombers cam eover to Budapest andthey were indiscrim inately 

bombing the city.  As a result about 30% of the city after threehoursof  bombing had been 

becam e rubble.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat
 
was that likefor you?  I m ean, you were aboy.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah.  W ell, it was a very tr aumatic event, of course. We had 
ever y
 
--
 
ever y building hada bomb cave. Of course when you startthebom bing, electricity 
goes away.  So you are sitting in a
 
very sm all  place.  I would say probably one quarter the size 
of  t h i s
 
--
 
of the auditorium .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And underground.
 
Under
 
--
 
well, half way underground and youare hearing these whistles when you know 
thebom bsare com ing.  And then youhearthese
 
trem endous blows  which is when they hit 
som ething. And we had four bom bs in thisthree hours which hit within 200 yards of our 

building.  And these buildings becam e rubbleof  course.  Most people died there. And we, for 

som e reason oranother, were not touched. But with that, I got such a trauma thatf or thenext 

s ix
-
odd years I could not sleep withouta
 
--
 
som ething onthe top of m y head.  My m otherwas 
tryin g to of  courseprotect me and in Hungary they used to have these big pillows, these goose 

feath
er pillows which wouldm uff le the sound. So she always brought in a goosefeather pillow 

andI slept with m y pillow on m y head until late '50s.  Andeven today I am  using earplugs 

because I can't take noise, particularly unexpected noise.  So that was
 
--
 
that was happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, you told me that it got to apoint where, because you were 
allowed outfor two hours, you alsoemerged, tried
 
--
 
based on the tim ing of  the bom bing, 
because theallies would bomb
 
--
 
theAmericans and British wouldbom b atone part of theday, 
the Russians would bom bat another. So you had that little window to get out.
 
>> George Pick:  Exactly.  Now, I shouldm ention thatthe way this whole thing was 
enf orced, this window was enforced was by a Christianf am ily by the nam eof  Varger.  Andhe 

wa s  a
 
--
 
the sub
 
--
 
how do you
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Superintendent.
 
>> George Pick:  Superintendent, right. T hesuper of the building. Now, he was the super 
of  the buildingf or quite a long tim e. Andm y relatives lived there
 
for a long time. Sothey were 
f riends. And Varger was a very hum aneandver y decentm an. Sohe hadhelped us asmuch 

as he could.  Buthis business was to close the doors and lock itf rom  the inside.
 
Now, this went on throughoutthe sum mer and som etim e
 
in Augustm y f ather'sunit was 
brought back to Budapest and that was goodnews f orus.  My father risked his lif ebut every 

otherday he was ableto com ehom e illegally at night, lateatnight, af ter midnight. And then he 

knocked on the door and Varger o
pened the door
 
>> Bill Benson:  Let him  in.
 
>> George Pick:  Let him  in, and thenhe waswith us for a couple of hours and then he 
went back. This happened quite
 
--
 
relatively of ten. 
 
So we thought thatm ore or less everybody by then knew that the Russians were already 
f ighting in Hungary, in the Hungarian area, and we didn't think that itwas going to last ver y 

long.
 

10
 
 
And then in October 15 the
 
--
 
Horthy was the regent, decided to make aproclamation on 
the radio that Hungary is now
 
--
 
not switchedsides but being neutral. T hey are not going to 
f ight the Russians,they are not going tof ightthe Germans. Now, he was a little too littleand 
too late. InAugust the Rom anians already switched, who were behind news the east. And 

they helpthe Germans and now thef ull Rom anian Arm y was f ighting on the sideof  the Soviets.  

So the declaration of neutrality was nothing. And it was somuch nothing that the loyalty of the 

Hungarian Arm y was not with the regent. Soaf ter two hours off ighting in the
 
--
 
we ll,  t h e
 
r ege n t  
wa s
 
--
 
he and his f am ily were arrested and a new ver y
 
--
 
th e
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Arrow C ross.
 
>> George Pick: T heArrow Cross go vernm ent took over and then
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And these aref anaticalfascists and now they
 
--
 
>> George Pick: T hey aref anaticalf ascistsand they can care lessabout anything.  They 
want to kill Jews as m uch as the rest of the SS.  So Eichm ann, who was
 
--
 
who lef t Budapest 
af ter July when the deportation started, I should say onthe 7th of July the regentall the 

deportation stopped. By then there were noJews in the provinces,only Jewish com m unity was 

in Budapest. Sohe cam ebackon the17th or 18th of October andhe and all of his Hungarian 

followers wantedto start deportations of the Budapest Jews.  And infact, within one week, 

10,000 young wom enwere deported. Among them , several of m y aunts and cousins. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And to reiterate apoint you made, George, this is October1944.  
Russians are really literally on the outskirts, the alliesare sweepingthrough Europe, the war is 

essentially over, and here's this concentrated eff ort again to exterm inate the Jews of  Hungary.
 
>> George Pick:  Budapest.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Budapest.
 
>> Ge o rge  P ick:  Righ t.  Ye s.  P recise ly.  Im ea n , it is
 
--
 
it ' s  irra t io na l, 
it's completely 
insane.  You know, wh en everybody
 
--
 
well, they were pushedf rom  ever y direction. They still 
had this
 
--
 
this thing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that meant now you're going to get
 
--
 
aspart of this effort you're now 
going to beforced into a ghetto.  So what happened?
 
>> George Pick: W ell, as a partof  this effort,oneof  thethings which happened was they 
did not have any transportation. Soas they startedtodeport the Jews of  Budapest, they were 

forced to walk.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because the trains were bombedand weren't running.
 
>> George Pick: T here were no trains anymore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  No trains lef t.
 
>> George Pick:  Andso they were f orcedtowalk.  And 50% of them  never m ade it to the 
border. And so30or 40,000 Jews were killed that way.  And m yf ather came home at the very 

endof  October stating thathe got 24
-
hourfurlough but the next m orning he was going to be 
deported, just likeI mentioned bef ore.  Andmy f ather had no
 
--
 
he didn't want to do that.  His 
comm ander was a Christian man, of  course, but hehad a Jewishf iancé who lived in our 

building and he gave everybody a furlough, saying, you know, boys, next m orning we are going 

to get together in the railroad station and you are going to go to Germ any.  Som y f atherof 

co u rse  
didn't want to do that,and he was desperately trying to f ind a placetohide.  And he 
went to af riendof his who was a Christian businessm an and he said, look, I need
 
--
 
I need a 
place to hide. And this guy was not very surp rised.  He gave him apieceof  paper, told him  to 

go to thisparticularaddress and see what happens.
 
So he went there. Hewas notf arf rom  this off ice, and it was a sm all factory.  And it was 

11
 
 
saying that it was a
 
--
 
an Arm y unif ormf actory.  And there was an Arm y m an inf ront and he told 
this Arm y man to let him  in and want totalk to the comm anding off icer.  And he let him inand it 
turned out that it was really a camouf laged
 
--
 
place camouf laged asa f actory but infact it was a 
placeof  about 60 to 70 Jewish laborers who were
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereposing as workers m aking unif orm sfor thefascists.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct, for
 
--
 
if  you went in you would see peopleworkin g on uniform s.  
But all those people were people like m yf ather who did not want toget deported.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  A complete ruse.
 
>> George Pick:  A com plete ruse, yes.  Andit was a f irst
 
--
 
it was ahigh priority place.  
So  m y
 
--
 
we didn't know where m y father was for about ten days.  And then m yf ather sentin 
a  
--
 
anarm ed soldier and senta notethat we should go with him . The soldier and no
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the soldiersare part of the ruse.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah, the soldier was alsoa defector. He was also a soldier but he 
def ected.  So we went and we f ound out
 
--
 
m y m other was very, ver y ambi
guous about it 
because her mother and her aunts were there.  It turns out that it could not have beenm ore 

than the lastm inutebecause very f ew hours later the house was raidedand all the peoplewho 

were there were takento a
 
--
 
af actory.  From there they would bedeported.  Andthis was m y 
grandm otherand her two sisters.  And Mr.
 
Varger who knew thef am ily im m ediately called m y 
m other's uncle who was already in what they call a protected building, Swedish protected 

building.  If you go upto the second
 
f loor youf ind a picture of  RaoulW allenberg.  Raoul 
W allenberg is a hero ofthe Hungarian Jews because he was able tohave another ruse givi ng 

people
 
--
 
peoplepapers which said that they were Swedish citi zens andduring the war they 
would be protectedby the Swedishembassy.  Of  course it was abluff, but the Nazis bought it 

for a while.  Andm y mother'suncle was in one of these buildings.  Varger called him .  He called 

theW allenberg office and they brought in m y grandm otherand her two sisters.  So th
e y 

essentially could thank Varger for their lives.
 
Andm eanwhile we we re in thisplace, thisfactory with 170people.By then everybody 
brought intheirfam ily and children, and again, thisplace was not very large and it was 

overcro wded and they had all these three
 
--
 
Im ean people slept everywhere, where they could
 
>> Bill Benson:  So onthe upperf loor, som ebody would walk in thestreet they'd see the 
workers and there's the fam ilies underneath in various places.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah, sort of, yeah.  And underneaththey had thisbig text tile m achines 
and so relatively easy to
 
--
 
to live there.  Andof  course, afterwards Iwas thinking it would have 
been atremendousproblem  tof eed these people.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> George Pick:  Im ean,140 people.  Notonly that, but there were four of these kindof  
factories. Altogether about 1,200 people, and it was the brainchildof a man by thenam eof  

Korm os.  His name was Kohn but his known (inaudible) was Korm os.  And it was not justone 

m an.  It was a numberof  Christiansand Jews and they worked together.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ohave f our of thesef actories.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah, communists,everybody.  It was probably the largest action like 
this resistance trying to save people there.  And everything went okay until the 2nd of 

December when we had the raid. And the raid was because Kormos was betrayed.  It's a 

com plicated story.  I wr ote itupand it's published, but they lookedat
 
--
 
they only knew three of 
thefour places. And Korm os was in theplace where we were.  He moved around, every night 

he slept som ewhereelse.  Andthey cam e in,f ive of them  with machine guns, and sortedout 

12
 
 
m en and wom en and children on theother side and, you know, against the wall and were told 
that wouldbe it.  Butfortunately this was in Decemberandthe Russians were about20m iles 

f rom  Budapest. So these HungarianGestapo m en were not quite as crazy as most of these 

fanatics and they were  ableto
 
--
 
or we were able to bribe them . So they got a lotof diamonds 
and doll
ars and whatever and they lef t and they said well, you areunder our protection now.  
Andnothing happened until about a week and ahalf  later where two policemen cam e and these 

two policem en told us that we are going to betaken tothe ghetto.  Now, before this happened, 

the little group of leaders in our 170, group of170, decidedthat the 22 children arenot very 

saf e in thishiding place but they would be safe ina Swiss Red Cross orphanage. And of 

course it was m yself  and 21 others. And so they
 
--
 
we
 
went thereand there were 500 children, 
30
 
--
 
in terrible conditions.  35 ina room , it was just a little part of a building, and I was walki ng 
around and lookingf orpeople who I knew butnobody was there.  And I decided andanother 

f riend who was m y age, we were ten, decided that we couldnot stay there. We want to elope, 

get out.
 
So in thenext morning we asked the lady
 
--
 
the building was of course lockedf rom  the 
outside. W easked the lady to take us out sowe could buy som efoodf or ourselves.  And
 
th i s  
lady took us out and we ran away.  And we ran back to wherem y parents were and his parents 

were.  It turnedoutthat aboutf ive days later the orphanage was taken to the Danube and the 

kids were shot into theDanube 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  A ll 500  k id s .
 
>
> George Pick:  All 500 kids, yeah. So if  you remember the last picture you only saw t wo  
c h ild
 
--
 
children. Onewas m e and theother one was the other kid. Andout of the 20
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were the only two that survi ved.
 
>> George Pick: We were the only two thatsurvi ved f rom  our group. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, and we're getting very short on time,butI really
 
--
 
we need you 
to tell what happened next.
 
>> George Pick: W ellwhat happenednext was they took us totheghetto. Out of 170 
only 
65 went to the ghettoand we and we lived inhorrible circum stances. W e hada
 
--
 
an old 
age hom e in the building andthe people were dying by
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And again, the im portance here is that you'reforced into a ghetto.  Now 
it's late December and there's still this attempt toforce you into sm aller quarters.
 
>> George Pick:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that you canbedeportedor killed more easily.  Here you are inthis 
com pressed little area now.
 
>> George Pick:  Right, there is a sm allarea,70,000people there, and they knew that 
they couldn't deportus so they had variousplans to kill us. One plan was to blow up the ghetto.  

Another plan was tobring in some SS and Hungarian Nazis to machine gunus.  Andf ortunately 

neither of  these happened.  But what happened is about half  of thepeople in thebuildingwhere 

we were who were m ostly old and sickdied.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Describe the circum stances in thisbuilding because now the siegeof  
Budapest is underway,  the Russianshave
 
--
 
im posed a s
iegeon the city, there's 
bombardm ents going on.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct. This building was a very old building.  Ithad a basem ent which 
hadnof loor. It was just dirt and we had to have the
 
--
 
the latrine in the m iddle and 200 of  us 
were pushed in to less than half of the area which you have inhere. And so we were ver y close 

together. Food supply was non
-
existent because anybody who was m oving on the street would 

13
 
 
be shotby sharp shooters from the housesor airplane bom bs, whatever.
 
My f ather was part of a ver y sm all group of the ghetto police whosebusiness was to try to 
save the Jews.  Of course, hedidn't have any arm sfor that. And helost two of  hispartners.  
But he him self was wal king the streets andtrying to make sure thatno peopledied.  
But again, 

because of the extended periodof  nofood, thousandsof peopledied of starvation.  Andwe got 

lice and everybody wa s ver y, ver y sick andf inally on January 18 the noise of war sort of  ceased 

and it was quiet.  And then we realized that we gotf reed. And we wentback. My m other and 

m y f ather were so weak that the tripf rom  where we were in the ghetto toour priorhouse, which 

is normally was like 35, 40 m inutes, would takef our hours.  And wehada small suitcase which 

I was carrying which was carrying thef am ily photos.  My m other could care less about anything 

else but shefelt that the fam ily photos were irreplaceable.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hich is why you have som e photos we used to start theprogram.
 
>> George Pick:  Precisely.  So and then we went home andm y father was toomuch of 
an optim ist.  Hethought that we would beademocracy or Hungary wil l be adem ocracy and 

thathe could makea living there. W ell, it turned out that he was toom uch of anoptim ist. The 

Ru s s ia n s  d id n ot  willin gl y go
 
out.  Instead they becam e a comm unist country with all the 
political oppression, et cetera. And then in 1956, it was the only country in the Soviet blocwho 

hada rebellion against it was Hungary.  I was  justf inishingm y studies asan engineerandI 

jo i
nedtheforcesfor those coupleof  weeks of f ighting. And then I saw that there is justnowa y 

th a t we
 
--
 
that the Russians would leave andso I decided to leavem yself .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Iwish we had another hour tohear about yourescape f rom Hungar
y,  
m aking it to the UnitedStates and then beginning a trem endous career here in the United 

States.  George, thank you for this.W e're going to close ourprogram in just a couple of 

m om ents. W edon't have tim efor questionsor it's just toom uchf or George to share with us, 

but when wef inish, after Georgef inishes, it'sour tradition that our First Personhasthe last 

word.  So I'm  going to turn back toGeorge toclose the program .  But when he'sdone,he's 

going to rem ain up here on the stage, so weask
 
that if any of  you want to ask him a question, 
com e up and just shake his hand, get your picture taken with him , he'll be here to do that.So 

we would appreciate itif  you would takeadvantage of that, if you don't mind. Justto rem ind 

you, we'll have a
 
First Person program  each W ednesday and Thursday until the m iddle of  
August. So we invite you back, if  you can com ethis year or lookf or our program next year.
 
W ith that, I'm  going to turn back toGeorge toclose today's program .  Thank youf orbeing 
wi
th us, and George, thank you.  So
 
--
 
>> George Pick:  Yes,thank youf or the lastword.  In the past Ihad stated often that we 
should betolerantand accept each other's religious cultural differences.  Now I say that 

tolerance andacceptance is notenough. W e m ust be proactive and f ight vigorously against 

anti
-
sem itism , racism ,and all types of hatredin this country and everywhere else in the world.  
Inm any places in theworld this hearing aid tread turns into violence, as you know ver y well 

f rom  yo u r 
newspapers, m assacres, wars and genocide. W e m ust not ignore this and let our 

leaders know thatthey m ust not ignore this either and that we need to do something to stop the 

violence and what is going on. It's unacceptable completely.  And that'smy last
 
word. 
 
(Applause)
