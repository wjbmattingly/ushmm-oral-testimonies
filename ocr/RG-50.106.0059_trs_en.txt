Question: This is United States Holocaust
 Memo rial Museum in
terview with Mr. Hugh 
Jenkins conducted by Margaret  G a rre tt  on Ja
nuary 31, 1997 in Wash
ington, D.C. Tape 
one, side  one. What was 
your name  a t  birth? 
Answer: 
My name  at birth was 
Hugh Montfort Jenkins. 
Q :  And what was the date 
and place of  your birth? 
A :  I  was born on the 29th of Decemb
er 1914 in Leices
ter, England. 
Q :  Would you talk some about your earl
y childhood, your fami ly, your growing up? 
A :  Well, I  a m the youngest son of a  family of
 eight. And myfather 
was a  Baptis
t minister 
and I  grew up in, mo stly in  Engl
and. I Œ I was born in Leicester 
and then we went
 to live in 
Luton when my  father moved to
 another church. Then w e  went
 to London, and I was sent 
to a  boarding school in
 Somerset. And -- 
Q :  How old were you when you were sent to boarding school? 
A :  Oh, quite young.About ten or something like 
that. I went to one of
 these  sc hools which 
is erroneously known as a  pub
lic school, named as public sc
hool, but the public school in 
those days was a  private Œ 

Q: Excuse me Œ  

A: What™s that? Private boarding school. And so
 it was considered 
a  very good thing, if  
you could afford it, to send your
 child to  be a t  the boardin
g school, o n e of these boarding 
schools. And that's
 where I  went.

Montfort Jenkins

Q :  Now, you were th
e  youngest of  eight? 
A :  Yeah. 
Q :  Were the older ones boys, girls? 
A :  Well, my eldest brother, 
my oldest two brothers were 
twins.And for reasons which I  
will never know, my fa
ther called them Linco ln and Ga
rfield. Then I  had two sisters, 
Myrtle and Iris. And th
en there were four boys
, four mo re b oys, Luke
, David, Noel and me . 
Q :  And how mu ch older th
an you were the twins? 
A: Oh, 14 years older than I was. 

Q :  S o  there were eight children sp r
ead out over 14 years and mo stly boys? 
A :  Yeah. 

Q: Um-hmm. 

A :  And-- 

Q: And what was your father like? 
A: He was a great man. He was a  marvel
ous -- he was a Welshman and he was a 
wonderful speaker and he just ha
d a, I  guess, a  very satisfacto
ry career as a minist er of 
different Baptist churches in 
England. Andhe was mi ldly ac
tive in politics, but not too 
mu ch so. And he devoted
 himself a  lot to his 
chapelan d  his family. 
Q: And your mo ther? 
A: My mother was also Welsh. H er n ame w a
s M ary Elizabeth Peug
h {ph}. And she was a  
very good singer. In fact, 
she and myfa ther  met ,
 I  think, when -- at  
a  temp erance me eting, 
you know,againstdrinking,where 
she  was a  soloist and he was 
a  speaker. And that was in 
Wales many, many years ago. A
nd, well, she had a  majo r j
ob, obviously, was br inging up 

Interview with Hugh 
Montfort Jenkins

a  fa mily. She had four children
 under three, twins and two mo re
 right off just afte r they 
were ma rri ed. And then there was a  gap and th
en four more, so  she 
was busy. And she wa s 
also v e ry ac tiv e i n  th e life o f  the ch urch. 
Q :  So what was the atmo
sphere in your home like? 
A :  Very much family oriented. 
I want to divert, I  think one of the great tragedies of today's 
life is the fact that so many kids grow 
up without families. I  ca
n't imagine not having 
grown up in a  family, as part 
of a  fami ly. And, obviously, wh
en I  was --  by the  time was 
five or six my  oldest brothers had already gone
off to university. But 
we all came  back for 
Christmas, and I  can  still reme
mb er the family  gath erings at
 Christmas and other special 
occasions. My two sist
ers ran a  private school and two 
of  my brothers also became 
ministers and the other brother was a businessm
an and then there w as me. And, well, w e  
lived through somedifficulttimes. A  minister's salary, I don'tknowabout nowadays, but 

in those days was not very 
adequate. And we li
ved through First, when I  was born in 
1914, right at the beginning of the First World 
War, and so my  father had to bring up eight 
children. And so we were all 
very busy. My sister
s realized that bei
ng two ladies amongst 
-- two girls amongst- -  with si
x boys, that unless they put th
eir foot down 
very early on 
they would finish up by bei
ng kind of housekeeper
s. So we all had 
duties, somebodyhad 
to do the washing out, somebody else had to 
clean all the shoes, somebody else had to 
make the beds. And we were a  fairly close-knit family. 
Q :  And did you have chores also? 
A :  Oh, yes, yes. You have to
 wash up. They say 
th at the male memb er
s of my generation 
of our family were ma rvelous 
husbands because they all had th
is training from their sisters.  

Interview with Hugh 
Montfort Jenkins

Q :  So even though you were the 
youngest, you had your 
chores to do? 
A :  Yes, Bib le. And -- 
Q :  So then you went away 
to school when you were 
ten. Did you want to go? 
A :  Yes, I  think so. It was a  
- -  i t  was a  very good experience,
 one I  wouldn't
 have missed. 
It was a very tough experience because when
 you are at a boarding 
school away from your 
parents, a  long way away from 
your parents, school di
scipline is quite tough,
 but as I  say, I  
wouldn't have missed it. And then I -- when I 
came back to -- to when I finished  school, I 
went into business and worked for a big in
ternational company, 
Kelly's Directory of 
Merchants, Manufacturers
 and Shippers of the World. A
nd then I  worked for one of  the 
big buildingsocieties,
 I  think they are called mo rt
gage and loan societies here. 
Q :  What kind of work did 
you do for thes
e comp anies? 
A :  Accountant,bookkeeping. 
Q: Um-hmm. 
A :  And then the w ar came. 
Q :  Backing up a  bit , how far did you go in school? 

A :  Oh, I  went through -- I  gra
duated from this public s chool. In
 those days, going to one of  
those schools was considered ve
ry adequate educat
ion. Some  of the - -  can I  stop for a  
minute? 

Q: Sure. 
{Pause.} 
Q :  You were saying that you we
nt about as far in school a s
 was usual for that time? 
A: For the kind of career that I had in mind.
 Several of my older brothers went to 

Interview with Hugh 
Montfort Jenkins

university. 
Q: Um-hmm. 
A :  But they  went in to the chur
ch o r  into teaching.
 But I  went into bus
iness and th en th e 
war came and the Œ  
Q :  Now, you had been working for 
how many years before the wa r c a me ?  
A: Let's see, 19 -- about eight years in business. 
Q :  About eight years in -- 
A :  My last job was in  a  town 
called Guildford in Surrey i n  
England, and it  was with the 
Abbey Road Building Society where  I  
worke d  as a  bookkeep
er --  sorry -- 
Q :  You were about 25 years old 
then when the war started? 
A: 
Yes .  
And before the war started 
I  had been involved somewh
at wi t h  the Quakers and 
their work  and the v ictims o f  
the Spanish Civil War. And, in
 fact, m y  wife i s  a  Basque 
from the north of Spain . When
 the Spanish Civil War broke
 out, the British government 
sent over a  mi ssion to 
bring over children f rom Spain to 
England to look after them while 
the war was going on. The idea was 
that it  would be a  temporary 
arrangement. 
And with 
every 40 children they sent one
 teacher. And they 
asked various cities 
all over England if 
they would take one group of these children. 
And the city where I  wa
s working, Guildford, 
said they would take a  group.
 And they asked for volunteers
, and I  volunteered t o  help 
prepare the hostel where the kids were going to
 live. And then later 
they asked me i f  I  
would go and live in the hostel, 
because there were 4 0  children 
and two girls, tw o tea chers,  
a teacher  and a teacher 's aid.  
And there were a  lot  of chor
es to doabout 
the house, and 
they wanted some manpower, so  they asked me to
 go live in the house. I  went to live in th e 

Interview with Hugh 
Montfort Jenkins

house and went to the offi
ce every day a s  usual. 
Q :  Now, was this your first as
soci ation with the Quakers? 
A :  Yeah,uh-huh. 
Q :  Had you done other kinds 
of volunteer - -  other voluntee
r work similar to that 
previously? 

A :  No,no. 
Q :  But that had some 
special appeal to you? 
A :  Well,  I  was the r e,  you know. The children
 came to Guildford, 
and then one of  my 
friends wa s a  Quaker,  who was very much i
nvolved in developing th
is project. And he 
said, you know, we need so
mebody to help, how about
 it? And I  said, fine. 
Q :  So it was through a  
friend in large part? 
A :  A  friend, yes. S o  th en also
 I  had some kind of sympa t hy w
ith the Quaker 
point of view. 
In  fact, I  w as a  conscientious
 objector during the war and wo
rked o n  the land when I  was 
called u p ,  and had in  the mean
time registered  with the Quak
ers a s  a  volunteer for any work 
they wanted me  to do. And in 1944 -- 
Q :  Could you -- could we back
 up? Could you say a  little bi
t more about the workingon 
the land? You were ca
lled up for the Army and you sai d  that you were a  conscientious 
objector? 

A: I went to the tribunal and they  were very fa
ir, I guess. They listen ed
 to what I  had to say 
and their first response was, well, we think you are quite sincere, but wrong, an d so you 

had better go work in the Army
 medical corps. AndI  said,no,
 I  wouldn't do that because 
that would me an I  wouldn't be
 bearing witness that I  was a 
conscientious objector because 

Interview with Hugh 
Montfort Jenkins

I  would be wearing a  cocky uni
form like everybody else a
nd I  wouldn't do that .  And so 
then they went back 
and forth some more.  A
nd they ca me back and 
said, in that case you 
will work o n  the land. And 
I  said, well, that's fine. 
Q :  So you did that in what 
capacity? Was it  a  government
 unit that you were with? 
A :  Well, no, they gave 
me  so many days to find a job on the land. 
Q: Isee. 
A :  And I  went to one o f  the 
local farmers and he looked a t  
me  in my office clothes and 
kind of grinned and he said, wel l ,  I  disagre e  w
ith you, but I  need - -  
w e  need workers, and 
if you want to come  an
d work for me , you can. But you are goi
ng t o  have to  work as a  --  
just like a  laborer. Ther
e is no fancy business. And so I 
did. I  worked on the land and -- 
Q :  Was that a  difficult 
decision for you to
 make? To take that course? 
A :  Yeah, b ecau se - -  because lo
ts o f  people that I  very grea
tly ad mired disagreed with  me. 
M y  own family -- 

Q: Your family disagreed? 
A :  Well, they didn't  support me
. I  me an, my  brother-in-law wa
s an officer in
 the Army and 
my  brothers were both ministers at that time, 
and so that one of my
 brothers was working 
for the Navy. So I was the only one who becam
e a  conscientious objec
tor and went to a 
tribunal and so forth. But the 
family were very s
upportive, again, they 
didn't agree with 
me , but that didn't affect
 their affection for me. 
Q :  Was there -- did you have anybody or 
any people who did agree with you and could 
support you with th
eir agreement? 
A :  Well, o f  course, a  lot o f  th eQ u a k ersw ere
 passivists. And on the land, I  was working on 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins

this big farm and there were 
quite a lot of other 
conscientious objectors all work ing on the 
land. And so that, well
, you weren't entirely al
one. On the other hand, ther e we re  a  lot of 
people who very vehemently d i sa
greed with us and didn't -- di
dn't bother to hide their 
feel in g s . In deed, when I  got ma
rried, in those days ac comm
odation was very difficult and 
you were appointed places to live. That is to
 say, if you couldn't 
find a place -- and 
teachers had a  priority. And my 
wife was teaching in 
the nursery school fo
r little children, 
so she had a priority and she got a place, 
found a place. But when we went th ere, the 
landlady said -- looked at me  and said I  
understand you are a consci
entious objector, and I 
said yes. And she 
said, well, you'r e not going to live 
in my house. And 
so we had to go 
find so mewhere else. But -- 
Q :  So you did get 
a lot of hostility? 
A :  Yes, yes. Not a  lot, but
 enough to make you realize th
at you were in an awkward 
position. And it was a  difficult Œ 
Q: Excuse me Œ  
A: It was an awkward situation,
 after all. It was what everybod
y felt was a  very just war. I  
felt the cause was just, 
I  just didn't  beli
eve that war would ever an
swer it. And so that you 
are living i n  -- England was in
 a  pretty rough position from th
e beginning, 
the first few 
year s.  I t  wa s ve ry 
difficult. 
We  had all sorts of, you know, mi
litary preparations for a  
possible invasion going on,
 so that kind of 
mindset. 
But I  just went out and worked and did 
my job on the land. And in the me
antime I  had, a s  I  said, regist
ered with the Quakers th at I  
was on th eir list of potential volunteers. 

Q: Now, this was a  list of 
volunteers who would go overseas?  

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
11 
A :  Yeah, anywhere.You see, I  a c tually si
gned up during the Spanish Civil War, I  would 
be a volunteer and I  was going to
 Spain, but the war ended 
before - -  before I  go t an 
assignment. 
Q: Um-hmm. 

A :  And so then in 1944
 they called me up. 
Q :  Excuse me. But somewhere along here you got married; is that right? 
A :  Yeah. It  was very impor
tant, 1942 I  got married. 
Q :  S o  that was after y ou 
were working on the land? 
A :  Yeah, afterwo
rking o n  the land . 
Q: I  have to  stop for a  minute. 

{Pause.} 

Q :  You were talking about 
that you got married in 1942? 
A :  Yeah. 
Q :  And that was while you 
were working on the land? 
A :  Yeah,uh-huh. 
Q :  And your wife you me t becau
se she came with the child
ren from the Spanish Civil 
War? 

A: Yes. 

Q :  Was she  a  Quaker  or Œ 
A :  No,no. 
Q :  But she  was a n  assi st ant  - -  she  wa
s with  th e Quaker
 refugeeeffort? 
A :  No, she was just with the children. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
12 
Q: Yes. 
A :  The mission for the ch
ildren was arranged by the 
Basque government, and i n  
conjunction with  and in res
ponse to this invitation from E
ngland they  would take these 
children. And so Ju anita was ju
st finishingher career, her e
ducation as a teacher, and so 
she volunteered to  come
 with the children. 
Q: Okay. 
A :  But it  was --  she volunteered to the Bas
que government when th
e y  were looking for 
teachers to  g o  with the children. A n d  w h en  th e--  th e  en d  o f  the Span ish C ivil W ar, when 
that home was closed dow
n, and some of the children went
 back to Spain and some  went 
to France where their parents 
were refugees, she became a te
acher in  an E
nglish nursery 
school, in a  wart ime nursery  for children of 
mothers who were worki
ng in the factories. 
And this was in Guildford. A
nd ju st near Guildford was the factory where they made the 

Churchill tanks. And there were a  l o t of wome
n working there, so th
ey had this nursery 
school right by the fa ct ory and 
she taughtthere. A
nd so she was teachi
ng there and I  was 
working on the land. We -- a t 
first we thought we would n o t  
get married till
 the war  was 
over, but we had been engaged 
since 1939 or somethi
ng, and by 1 942 we decided why wait 
any longer, because there seem
ed  t o  be n o  p r osp ect  th e  w a r w a s g o i n g  to  b e  over any 
quick mo ment. So we  got 
married and I  - -  just 
after that i n  1944, as I  say,  the  Quakers got 
in touch with me  and 
said they wanted me to come up 
to London to go to their training 
institu te to w o rk  fo r --  to  jo in  the team that
 was to go and work in Europe. And so I  did, I  
left  th e job in  Guildford. And this was an 
acceptable alternative 
under the laws which 
govern me  being a conscienti
ous objector, this was somethi
ng I  coul d do. And so I  was 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
13 
trained by the Quakers, very
 interesting experience. 
Q :  What w as that lik e? 
A :  It was w onderful, becau se th ey  did ever
yth ing --  their o b j ectiv e w a s n o t  to  m a k e  you 
into a  highly-skilled technician
 or anything li ke that,  but 
to make you into a  per son who 
could copewiththings 
without the usual faciliti
es. So, I  mean, they had the --  in the team 
there were social work ers and people like th
at. But the training was more to teach you how 
to cope with new situat
ions. So they had a  lot of, kind of
, make-b elieve. We lived in a  big 
house in Hampstead and they would -- one da
y they would decide that this house was a  
refugee center and that thousa
nds of refugees we
re coming out of Ge
rmany and they had 
to be taken care of. So half the team would 
be the people looking after the house and th e 
other half of the team would 
be the refugees. And they were
 in structed to
 behave like 
people w h o are very desperate, 
who didn't trust anybody after 
their treatmentinGermany, 
so they wo uldn't want to be registered, th ey
 wouldn't want to have 
their names taken. And 
our job was to learn to 
try and cope with the m  and, yes, i t  
was - -  it sounds a  
bit odd, but it  
was really very useful. Another da
y they --  th ey said, well, w e  
just h ad an  air raid and there 
is no --  the house i s  being dest
royed and so we  have got to
 make do. And so we were 
shoved out in the garden. And in th e garden ther
e were ju st a few vegetables that have to 
b e  in  the garden, and w e  were
 to ld to find a  way of keep i
ng ourselves aliv
e for th e day. 
We were  to ld to dig up the potatoes and make
 some  soup out of boxe
s because there were 
no stoves or 
anything. 
And so it  was this idea  of being 
on your own, having to do things 
that you had never done before, 
and not running away from the j
ob. And that certainly was 
very useful. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
14 
Q :  Did you train  with t h e team 
that you eventually worked with? 
A: Yes. 
Q :  So you started toge
ther from the beginning? 
A :  Yeah, we star ted to gether a s kind of a  
mi scellaneous group,but 
then they gradually 
selected th e people that were 
going to be on the team. And th
en we went on training as a  
team and we were suppos
ed to go t o  Holland. 

Q :  Before w e  d o  that, as part
 of the training was re ligion a  
big part or any part of the 
training? 
A :  Quaker -- Quaker practices we
re part of the training. We 
went -- in our team, I think 
there w ere only two Q u akers, 
people who were --  people w
ho were members of aFriends 
Meeting. The rest of u s  were 
Baptists, Congregationalists, Jews
 and - - but we did have - - 
we started all our like team meetings, disc
ussion groups, with  a fairly long period of 
silence, which is, you know, the way the Quaker
s generally prepare th
emselves for - -  in  
their relig ious serv ice. S o  we
 were very much aware that 
we represented 
the Quakers and 
that we would be expected to
behave like -- carry
 out the principles of the Friends. And 
this did -- this wasan importa
nt factor because s
ubsequently when we were working in 
Germany u nder the --  while the 
war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were 
times w h en  what the military
 auth orities wanted
 us to do and what th e Quakers would 
think would be the appropriate thin g to do were
n't quite the same . And 
so we had  to face 
up tothat. 

Q: Um-hmm. 

A :  Our typical job was housing,
 you know.In one town where 
we  were, this is before 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
15 
Belsen,  in o n e town where we were, the Army
 billeted us on a  hous
e that belonged to a  
German fami ly. And the technique was the fa
mily just had to leave and find their own 
place and the house was ta
ken over by the o ccupation authorities.
 We didn't  --  we realized 
that we had t o  be housed somewhere. We  realized
 that the family that 
we we re  - - to  whom 
the house belonged were obviously very unhappy abou
t the whole situation.So we came to 
a compromise. So  we -- 
two o r  th ree members o f
 the family lived in the very top floor of 
the house, which we didn't have 
t o  use, and we took over the 
rest of the  house so that we 
didn't  feel that we  
were kind of being part
 of  an action t o  take
 the property  away fro m 
the family. Plus, obviously,the 
army  would have given i t  back
 tothefamily
 eventually. 
But in  th e meantime t h ey
 were v ery anxious to  b e  able t o  
k eep  so m e  o u t  o f  the place. That 
was only a  little example.But we
, actually, got on very well with the military authorities. 

They were very, very u ndersta
nding of what we were doing, a
ppreciative of  what we were 
doing, because we did lo
ts of jobs. Belson was 
only one of many jobs. 
Q :  Could we go back t o  wh
en you were called up -- 
A :  Yeah. 

Q :  -- in 1944? 
A :  Yeah. Well, after the traini
ng we were assigned to go to 
Holland. And the idea was that 
probably in the  fighting the 
dikes would be
 broken and the place would be flooded and 
they would need urgent, emergency relief. 
Well, as it happened, we never did go to 
Holland. W e  went to  B elgiu m a
nd we were working as kind of
 just relief work, a s  in  
Antwerp, doing all sorts of odd 
jobs, but kind of replacing th
e normal civic servi ces which 
would be disrupted  by the war, et cetera. A
nd while we were there, we got a  message 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
16 
saying that we had to p ack up 
our goods and be prepar
ed to be on the ro
ad at  si x o 'c lock 
the n ext mo rning. W e l l ,  there 
were 12 of us in  this team
 and we had been living in 
Antwerp doing odd jobs and we 
had our own headquarters. 
Q :  Men and women? 
A :  Men and women. 

Q :  And what age range? 
A :  I  should think we were al
l in our mid 20s o r  early 30s
. There was one woman who was 
I  think in her mid 40s or perhap
s even later than that. She was 
the oldest o f  the lot. B u t, 
you know, we kind of spread around in our lo
dgings and so on. And 
we, of course, had 
our own cooking things, field kitchen and all that
 kind of thing, and we
 were situated in a 
school that was our centerof
 activity. And, you know, an 
empty school. And so i t  was 
some job to put all this stuf
f, get al l our per sonal belongings
 and the t eam 
belongings and 
the team eq uipment an d get it all p acked u p  in  our
 -- we had five vehicles attach ed to us, 
one ambulance -- two ambulances, one big 
truck and two small personnel trucks. 
And we were on the road 
at  six o'clock the next 
morning. 
And our destination after three 
days driving, I  think it  was 
two days driving, wa
s Belson. And we di
dn't  know we were 
going -- we  knew we were going 
t o  a  ca mp  s o mewh er e  i n  
Germany. 
And we arrived a t 
Belson about four or  fi
ve days a f te r the  ca mp
 being uncovered.So it 
was all just like it 
was, 10,000 unburied dead. 

Q: It  is almost time 
to change the tape
, so ma ybe this would be 
a  good place to stop so we 
won't havetointerrupt.

Q: HughJenkins, tape one, side
 B. You were saying that you 
arrived in Be
lson on April -- 
A :  Sunday, April the 22nd. The camp, I think,
 was -- had been f
oundjust about a week 
before. And th at 's  th e d a y  -- 
I arrived in Belson on Saturd ay, on Satu rday even ing. And 
then on Sunday, when we got ourselves a  place 
to  park o u rselves, I  
went into th e camp o n  
Sunday, the 21st - - th
e 22nd to Camp No. 211, which was 
the place where they had kept 
all the children. One of 
the magnificent things aboutthec a mp
 was the fact that  - -  wel l ,  le t 
me  go back a bit. The camp  was 
in  terrible st ate because it ha
d, by lack of concern and so 
forth, i t  had been allowed to get into a  hor
riblecondition. It was 
originally a  ca mp for 
about 3,000 people and there were about 50,000 
peoplein there. There were, I think, 600 
people in a  hut thatwasdesigne
d for 50 and they were layered.
 But despite that, and then 
as the last days before 
the camp was overtaken, everyt
hing broke down,
 food, no food 
supply, no water supply.
 And --  but despite t h at, the pe
oplehad put the children --  the 
inmates, no t t h e --  the author
ities, had put the children al
l into one barrack where they 
could look after them specially. 
And whereas in those l ast days
 it  wa s a  kind of  every man 
for himself as far as food was 
concerned, they made sure 
that the children were looked 
after a s  best as they could 
in those terribleconditions. And 
my  first job was to  d rive an  
ambulance down into the ca mp an d sta r t  gett
ing the children out. The ar rangement was 
that about three mi les up the 
road from the c a mp, 
the concentra tion c amp,  there was a  big 
German Army establishment which, of course
, was empty and - -  but 
i t  had big c oncrete 
buildings, you know, barrack s and so on. So th
at was made in to a  reception center. And 
the --  between the concentrat
ion camp and the new camp , ther
e was what was known as a 
kind of human laundry. And we 
had --  the a mbulances were 
divided into two groups. And 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
18 
so me ambulances were in the 
camp, going from the camp to th
is mid station, which was 
just on the side of the road, it was a stab le
. Bu t there they  had set up a  whole -- an 
arrangement for disinfecting and 
cleaning people up and so on. 
And then the other side of 
this place there were clean am
bulances which were goi
ng from the - -  from 
this place to  the 
new --  to the new establishmen
t. S o  that there was a  kind 
of an insulation between the 
diseases an d the lice and ever
ything that the people, that th
e camp inma tes had, that were 
all washed off and disinfecte
d and stripped of their clot
hing and wrapped in a  c l ean 
blanket. And then the other end of the -- th
e other side of the bu
ilding, they would be 
loaded into another ambulancewhich tookthem 
to the --  t o  this new establishment. So 
you had one series of ambulances going between
 the camp o f  what th ey called th e human 
laundry and another se ries 
of  ambulances going from th
e laundry to the new camp. 
Q :  S o  there were dirty  ambulances tak i n g  th e m
 an d  th en  clean  amb u la
nces after they got 
through their laundry? 

A :  They were kept separate, yeah. 
Q :  And you were driving one
 of th e dirty ambulances? 
A :  Yeah. And so that was my  fi
rst job, going in and 
helping get these ch ildren out of the -- 
out of the -- then because I was 
the  truck driver in charge of 
the big truck. Well, one of the 
things, when we first 
arrived there, the aut
horities would not allow 
the girls, the female 
me mb ers of the team to  enter the concentrat
ion camp. There were seven girls a nd five 
men. But th e men were all assigned to work in
 the camp and the g i rl
s were all assigned to 
work in the new, you know, recep
tion center i n  
the hospital. 
Q :  What do you think the 
reasoning was for that? 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
19 
A :  Well, I  think to begi
n  w i t h ,  th in g s  w e re  s o  - -  w h en  w e
 first got there 
things w ere so  
unsettledin  the camp. Th
ere were --  th e S S  g u ards were sti l
l there. They we
re being forced 
to help bury the dead, and the SS women were 
still there. And it wa
s pretty rough kind of 
situation and I  think 
th at the people in  authorit
y felt that t h ey didn't  
want to  risk  the g i r l s  
g o i ng  into the camp. 
Q: For their physical safety or ju
st what they would have to --  
A :  Well, I  think probably 
i t  w a s  su ch  a  - -  i t  w a s - -  i t  
was such an outra
geous situation. 
Nobody, you know, people had he
ard of Auschwitz and the de
ath camp  and so on. But 
Belson  wasdi ffe rent. Belson 
--  nobody really knew about Be
lson until it  was discovered 
because it h ad never been id entifi
ed particularly as  an  exterm
in ation camp.S o  you had this 
peculiarly  - - {beeping sound} -- turn that off 
-- had this peculiarly 
unsettled and unpleasant 
si tuation. A nd I guess the Ar
my authorities in charge, they
 had the Army medical corps 
men working there, and in any 
case there were so many jobs 
to be done because what we  
were really doing was creati
ng a  new -- cr eat ing a  hosp
ital  as we went along -- 
Q: Um-hmm. 

A :  -- you know. Empty buildings and so on we
re being furnished a nd all the supportive 
services tha t you have i n  a  hospital  were  t rying 
tobe set up as quickly
 as possible to cope 
with the situation. W e  -- a  lot o f  the first thi
ngs I  think they did, we
 I  think were the very 
first people, non Army  people in 
the c a mp. We  went up --  ther
e were six teams that were  
calledin, I  think five --
 four Red Cross teams 
and one girls --  girl 
guides team, and the one 
Quaker team were called in 
in that very fi rst  a ppeal fo
r immediatehelp.But thensoon 
after that they got a whole group of volunteer young medical students from England who 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
20 
came out. But it  was a  --  i t was the kind of
 thing to begin with
 when everybody was doing 
whatever immediately needed to be done.Th
ere was not a  highly or
ganized and orderly 
procedure becau se you had the terrible pressure 
o f  the fact that whil
e w e  were evacuating 
the camp  I  think another 15,000 
died. 25,000 were --  were save
d,we re taken to the new 
camp. B u t i t  w a s  v e ry ,  v e ry  haphazard .  So, 
for example, af ter  th at fir s t  ru n  in  the 
ambulance, I was sent off in my truck and to
ld to find whatever I 
could that would be 
useful for  t h e ca mp.  
Bed linen, towels. 
Q: This is outside of th e camp? 
A: Yeah. SoIwent to the -- where this Germ
an estab lishmen t,milita
ry establishment was,  
there was a  set of big 
houses which belonged to the high 
command. And the fir s t place  I  
went was t h ere. I  went  through a
ll the places - -  all the houses. 
Q :  Were the houses empty? 

A :  Oh, yes. The Germans had gone a long time
 -- well, not a long time ago, but had gone. 
And so I  used to go around picking up, gett i
ng all the bed linen, al
l the towels, all the 
kitchen ute n sils, anything 
that I  could pick up in 
my truck and take it  
back to  the new camp 
to  help furnish it. And then 
after that w e  disco v ered -- I  
think it  was our team that 
discovered that ther
e were around the camp a  number of
 farms which had vegeta bles,  
leeks,  ca rro ts and what have
 you, you know, just lying unharv
ested. And so
 my job from 
then on was to go out every day and go ar
ound and scour around the 
countryside and find 
out where there was a  fiel
d of leeks or vegetable garden a
nd so on and get local --  I  worked 
with a  -- a  German local fellow
 w ho helped me  iden tify a  p la
ce wh ere - -  a  local inhabitant 
who knew the country. So he kne
w where the stuff we re,  and 
also he knew the villages. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
21 
And he used to recruit people 
from the villag e. And I would ta
ke them in my truck, which 
had a  big Red Cross 
flag on the fro nt of it, and take them
 t o  this field a
nd stay with th em 
all the while they we
re working, b ecau se 
th ey wouldn 't w o rk u n l ess t h ey  h a d  th e 
protection of the truck and the Red Cross flag. 
And when we got --  wh
en  w e  got th e load 
of vegetables, I  would take th
ese people back to th
e village and then 
would take the food 
back to the camp kitchens, and that
's what I  did most of the time. 
Q :  What was the attitude 
of this young German man to
ward you and your efforts? 
A :  Oh, h e  was very  helpful. H e
 wasn 't  -- he was -- I'm not su
re how much o f  
a  re si st er h e  
was, but he certainly wasn 't -- he was very 
anti Nazi. And he was known in the district fo r 
being a  very -- I  forget what 
his job was. I  think he was 
working in some factory or 
something. Anyhow, he was qui
te well respected and known in
 the district, and so he 
helped me  organize this. But 
some of the people, of  cour
se, were not very friendly. 
Q: Um-hmm. 
A :  I  remember one lady who we 
went to  her farm. She was ma
rried to so me h i gh official, 
who wasn't  there, of 
course. And she was grumbling about
 the fact that, you know, these 
workers, th ey are terrib le, the 
mo ment they got the 
chance they ran away
. These are  forced  
laborers, mind you. I  said, we
ll, what did you expect them 
to do? And so she was going on 
about this. And I  said t o  her, you see th
at? You know that pla
ce overthere,that 
concentration camp? And she said, well, she 
kind of denied knowing 
anything about it. So 
I told her w h at   it was like there, and 
the Red Cross was there,
 be cau se  sh e w as so  
unsympathetic. Lots of  the 
people were. We  had a  lot of
, I  mean, you know, we weren't 
sunk in a  sea of Nazis or a
nything like that. Mo
st of  the people who were the local 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
22 
inhabitants were very unders
tand -- you know, were
n't bitter or  an
tagonistic. Although 
they did, the Army , I  
rememb er, did one day while we were
 there b ring th e may o rs and th e 
senior citizens of  the -- f r
om around Belson and make them 
walk through the camp, walk 
through all  these  dead bodies, et  
cetera. So I  t h ink that -- so 
they should know exactly what  
they had been putting up with. 
Q :  Were you there when that happened? 
A :  Then, well, we had 
a little hospita
l in the camp , I rememb er. 
Q: Inside the camp ? 
A :  Yeah. It was r eal ly kind of
 a  first aid stand. Our main 
- -  obviously, the whole priority 
was getting the people out. We ha
d a  kind of  a  score
board we used t o  keep of  the number 
of people w e evacuated each day. Like a  co mpetition, you know.Yesterday it was 310 

people, today we managed to 
do 370people. Always 
trying to beat th
e previous day's 
reco rd. And the -- I forgot my  trainofthoughtnow. 
Q :  You were talking ab out what you were doi
ng inside the camp and 
that you had the first 
aid station. 
A: Oh,yes. 
Q: Did you work at the first aid station? 
A :  Oh, yes, excuse me. And in the me an
time, because there we
re,  you know, se veral 
thousand people in the camp
, we had this set up, th
is little first aid stat
ion to give whatever 
assistance o n e could g i ve in  
a  temporary way. And -- but the 
station was actually operated 
by inma tes, by doctors who had been --  w
ho were part of the people inside the 
concentration camp. So it was -- we had to ha
ve hours. We just couldn't keep the place 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
23 
open 24 hours a  day becau
se these people the mse lv
es we re suffer ing. So we had to kind of 
have i t  open from 9:00 in the mo
rning until 6:00 in the evening 
or something. I  used to go 
down there occasionall y to take
 some  supplies or some thing.
 And, obviously, I  w ent one 
day when we had to close the camp , close 
t h e doors. And it was a  terrible job because 
there were people outside that 
pro b ably spen t the last tw o da
ys gradually making their way 
to  this thing becau se th ey coul
dn 't walk, th ey ,  y o u  k n o w ,  t h ey  
w e re to o  w eak  to  just w alk 
there. So you felt  that , at lea st  I  felt, 
you know, when you looked at  these people and you 

thought, my gosh, some of them 
will probably be
 dead before the camp
 --  before the place 
is open in the morning. And 
when I  was closing the camp a  
young girl came up to me  and 
said you must give me  some thi
ng for my mo ther. Shei s  very 
ill. And I  said, well, the aid 
centeri s  closed. And she said 
but you must get me some thing.
 So I  went inside and got 
some aspirins and gave them to her and said
, well, maybe these will help your mother. It 
was just a  g esture . I  didn't know
, the mo ther wasn't  
there. But, on the other  hand, the girl 
was so desperate to ha
ve somebody do somethi
ng. And about three or
 four -- three weeks 
later when w e  w e re  in  th e --
 when the camp  was emptied 
eventually and it was burned 
down and all the people that were in the cam
p were n o w i n  this 
new -- in this new 
establishment, this young lady ca
me up to me and said,  oh, yo
u are  the man who saved my 
mother 'sl if e. And I  --  because
 I  didn't recognize her  bec a use 
before I  had seen her in a  
concentration camp , filth, you know, now she was 
--  after the camp wa
s dressed nicely and 
so on. But a pparently I  was the - - she 
was the girlI gave the aspirins to. 
Q :  That's  quite a  story. 

A :  And then we had a  -- we had a  very, very  
impressive concertin 
the new camp. The day 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
24 
the last barrack - -  
the barracks were burned down. A
nd the concert was given by the 
ex-inmates and it really was 
terrific. I  mean , in
side th e camp there were people who had 
been in symphony orchestras a
nd opera singers and 
all that , lots of  
people, mo stlyof  
Jewi sh 
extraction. 
And so they gave the  concert. 
And it  was really most moving. 
Everybody singing their hearts
 out. It  was very good. 
Q :  And this was th e nig h t be
fore the camp was burned down? 
A :  Yes, i t  was in  the n ew c a mp
. The old camp was burned down. 
Q :  Yeah, right. Was th e 
old camp  all burned a t  once or in  part s?  
A :  Well, it was burned 
hut by hut. But it  was obviously -- i t
 was kind of accelerated as 
time went on. To begin with, obviously, it 
was very dangerous to start burning once you 
evacuated a  hut. You couldn 't  b u r n  it  right
 away because there 
w ere hutsall around. 
Q :  So did you do other j
obs inside the ca mp, 
inside the ol d ca mp? 
A: Yes, because I was a kind of general errand 
boy. I used to take th e -- anything that 
needed a  truck. 

Q :  And who would ask you to do something? 
Would it b e one of the Friends group or 
would it be one of the Army or anybody would ask you? 
A :  Well, obviously, my  first ch
annel of authority was our ow
n team and our team leader. 
Q :  You had a  tea m lea d er for the 12 of you? 
A :  For us 12, yes. So she would give me  
maybe so me general in
structions, saying why 
don't you go report to so-and- so and 
see what they need  to be done. 
Q :  That would be 
an Army  person? 
A :  Yeah, a n  Army  person. Or 
as time went on, of course, 
more people came in, doctors 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
25 
and things like that. But mo st of the ti me
, mo st of the time my  primary job was going 
around and each  day I did a vegeta
ble run, w h ich didn't take 
the whole day, of course. 
Q :  But that was your primary j
ob, t o  go out of the ca mp --  
A :  To get supplies. 

Q :  -- into the surrounding area? 

A :  Yeah. 
Q :  That's  becau se you had a  truck ? 
A :  Yeah. 

Q :  That you were the one with
 the truck, that made you th
e logical person to d o  that? 
A :  My job on the team was tr
ansport officer. So I  was re
sponsible for k
eeping all the 
vehicles, the fivevehicles
 operating, but --  and I  my
self drove the big truck. 
Q :  So that got you away from th
e  horror for part of the time? 
A :  Yes, yes. And -- 
Q :  And then for the rest of the day, what
 would you do after you did your vegetable run? 
A :  Oh, let me  see if  I  can remind myself. 
Q :  Did you have to work on yo
ur trucks and keep them r
unning or were they working 
pretty well? 

A :  Well, th e truck s, yeah, the tr
ucks went well. But it was - -  
most o f  the work in side the 
camp was taking workers around. 
Q :  Taking who around? 
A: Workers. 

Q :  Oh, workers, I  see. So 
you take them from one area 
of the c amp t o  another? 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
26 
A :  Yeah. The ca mp wa s under th
e control, obviously, of t h e Br
it ish Army, but they had a  
lot of Hungarian soldiers who we
r e p r i s o n e rs o f w a r a s  it  were, who were used t o w o rk in  
the camp  doing various 
jobs. Another of my j
obs was to report to th
e person in charge to 
take these men down t o  hut number so-and-so 
where we have a  clean
-up job to do or -- 
Q :  Were they str
ong enough to work? 
A :  Oh, yeah, these were Hung --  t h ese we re  
not ca mp inma tes. These wer e  part of the 
Hungarian Army . When the camp
 was taken over the 
by t h e Brit ish,  i t 
was taken over in a  
truce between the Eighth Ar
my , the British Eighth Army
 and the G erman Army, 
whichever i t  was, the idea bei
ngt o  create a  sanita
tion zoneandthere 
would be no fighting 
in that zone. So that you wouldn'
t have - -  that was the great pr
oblem that when - -  to begin 
with everybody was afraid of, but
 this camp was a,  a  hive of
 illness, tuberculosis, typhus 
and everything you can think of. And people were
 afraid, I think, the Germans were afraid  
that if  the fi ghting went thr
ough that zone, then 
people in the camp would all get out and 
start trying to find their way 
back home and then you woul
d have kind of a  wave of 
diseased people off on their ow
n. And so it w a s arranged that
 the camp should be handed 
over in tact b y  the German s to  
the British and with the cond
ition that all thepeople, the 
Germans who had been working 
in the c a mp as guards and so
 on, would have t o  be -- 
would b e  retained th ere, wherea
s the German Army  retreated fr
om that area an d the British 
entered without fighting. 
Q: Okay. 
A :  And part of the deal wa
s that  among the German Army 
were these Hungarian troops. 
Q: Okay. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
27 
A :  And they were considered neutrals at  th
at p o int and,I  mean, they weren 't the prime 
enemy. And they were --  i t wa
s agreed that - -  presumably th
at they should stay and guard 
the perime ter of  the camp to make sure 
that nobody got out. Bu
t underthecontrol, 
obviously, of the British. So th
at a t  the same ti me  they w
ould -- they were manpower and 
there were lots of jobs to 
be done. The water system broke 
down, so you had to -- we  had 
to find a  -- and the drai
nage system. Everything was in ki
nd of a  state of disrepair and 
needed temporary -- 
Q :  So after the beginning when
 you were driving the ambulan
ce, you did not have a  lot of 
direct contact with th e former -- 
A :  No,no. 
Q :  -- concentration camp  su rvi
vors? You were mo re involved 
in collecting ve
getables and 
ma intenance -- 

A :  Yeah. I  was in and out
 of the camp  all day. 
Q :  Were you concerned that 
you would get sick i f  there 
was so mu ch diseasearound? 
A :  No, you really didn't  have
 time t o  think about it. 
Q :  What kind of a  day di
d you work? How long a  day? 
A :  Oh, as long as was 
necessary. I  mean Œ 
Q :  I  should say, how long di
d you get to sleep at night? 
A :  Well, I  guess we  probably got
 to bed about ten o '
c lock, eleven o 'clo ck at  night. But --  
and, of course , it was an incr
easing deceleration as
 the -- each day ther
e were less  people 
in  the camp , and each d a y  th ere f o r e there w ere 
less crises in  th e camp
. So it  gradually got 
easier and easier. But Œ  

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
28 
Q :  Where did you sleep? 
A :  We slept in the -- in
 barracks in  the n ew camp. 
Q :  Um-hmm. And is that wh
ere you had your me als also? 
A :  Well, I  think we had our
 meals at fi
eld kitchens. 
Q: Um-hmm. They were army  field kitchens? 

A :  I  seem t o  reme mb er - -  I  have some  pict
ures over here of a  w
hole group of us standing 
around, just around a  fi
eld kit cheneating.  

Q :  And did you have any time when you weren't 
working that you had a  
chance to feel or 
talk to your team me mbers? 
A :  Oh, yes, we had --  we met 
- -  we were all housed in  the same area and we  used to have 
team me etings quite regularly. 
Q :  And what were they like? 

A :  Well, they were --
 they were mostly reporting sessi
ons because all of us were doing 
different things and quite ofte
n we didn't  see each other du
ring the day. The gir l s were 
mostly working as like nurses 
or one of th e girls was a c
ook -- not a cook -- a  caterer and 
was working in the kitchens. 
And the -- w e  had one Jewish
 girl who was a  very, very 
important me mb er of the team. She got into 
the camp, frequented, 
before there was any 
kind of relaxation of  the rules 
she got into the camp  becaus
e she was, obviously, terribly 
motivated to see exactly what
 was happening to her people in
 the camp. And she used to 
wear a  big copper Star of Da

went into the camp wearing this, it was ve

back a s  some thing to be asha
med of. And to see this girl 
wearing the Star of David as 
something t o  be proud of wa
s -- meant a  lot  to  the m.  
Q :  So what was the mo ra
le like in your team? 
A :  I  think i t  was pretty good becau
se w e  w ere too busy to  allo
w  th e e n v i ro n men t to  affect 
us. We  always had some thing 
to do. And everything we had to do, even if I  can't 
remember what it is no
w, what it  was now, was urgent. 
And we had comp letely separate 
responsibilities, like I  wa
s on my own in this tr
uck. And I  think that 
the real impact came 
when we left the camp and in our next assi
gn men t when w e  became
, I  think, where we 
suffered a  kind of delayed shock. We were ve
ry highly disciplined a
nd neat and tidy team. 
But I  think in our next assi
gnment after Belson we went th
rougha  period when we were 
kind of untidy and people didn't
 turn out meals a t  the right
 timeandundisc
iplined. But 
then we settled down again and Œ 
Q :  Did people talk about it? 
A :  Onlyin terms 
of things to do. 
Q :  No, but I  mean in  th e 
next assignment when -- 
A :  No, no, i t  wasn 't -- 

Q :  -- when the shock hit? 
A: No. 

Q :  People didn't say, oh, 
that was really horrible? 
A :  No, no, I  mean, that  went 
without saying. And then whenyou see perhaps - -  fortunately 
for u s, after our - -  w e left 
the day the camp  was 
burned down, I  think,
 the next day or 
something like that. We were
 sent off  to 
another job. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
30 
Q :  How did that feel? 
A :  Well, it was another rush job. 
Q :  I mean to leave. Was it 
a  relief t o  get away
 from there o r  --  
also hard to go? 
A :  No, I  think there was nothing 
more for us to do. We had done
 our job so it  was just a  
question of getting on with the next job. 
Q: Um-hmm. 
A: And it became  part of th
e, well, w e  ju st focused our
 attentionon 
our new work. 
Q :  Um-hmm. What was your new work? 
A :  Well, to begin with
 we had a  very intere
sting job. Very tempor
ary.The railways in 
Germany had all been ve
ry badly bombed. And after the wa
r they w ere rec
onstructing the, 
w ell, they were reconstructing 
the railways. S o  thousands of 
forced laborers 
who wanted to 
get b ack to  their ho mes in Ho
lland and France and so on, a
nd so they had trains coming 
into Germany to  the po int wh
ere th e German railways were bombed and trucks coming out 
o f  German y to  this point where th e -- w h er
e  t h e rai l way started. And the people were 
transferred from trucks to th e train. And our job 
was to -- to assist in
 this transfer. People 
had all sorts of problems and there was a quest
ion of food and things like that. To get the 
people off the trucks and into th
e trains and the trai
ns went back to sa
y Belgium, Holland, 
France and so on. And we did that for -- not
 for very long, about a week or so, because 
very quickly the railway was repa
ired to another sta
tion farther on, and so --  and t h en we 
were sent t o  Brunswick, and w e  --  that was 
our biggest an d most time-consuming job. We 
eventually became in ch
arge of a huge Polish camp of 3,
500 Poles,  and the Quaker team, 
the 1 2  o f  us administered it. A
nd that was quite an experience. 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
31 
Q :  What w as that lik e? 
A :  Well, it  was --  i t  
w a s v e ry  in ter e st in g  because, see, it
 was a  v ery diffic
ult situation in 
some way s because the Poles 
consider th emselves - -  cons
idered themselv
es th e first 
fighters in the war. They were the first country 
attacked by Germany.  And they, of course, 
the country was very badly beaten up. And 
the Germans were very
 bad to  the Poles 
because t h e y  co n s id ere d  th em  kind o f  second-cl
ass citizens and brou ght
 them in  for forced 
labor and so -- but when the war was over th
e Poles kind of felt, well, you know, th ey 
ought to be all considered hero
s because they were 
the ones who fi rst  st
ar ted tofightthe 
Germans. Andso they used to
 get - -  and they wanted to  
go home, but they couldn't go 
home because there was a  problem inside  
Poland as to who wa
s going to govern the 
country. So they  lived in this camp  and we 
-- we looked after them
, you know. We were 
the kind of town council -- like city gove
rnment.One was lo oking after schools, one was 
looking after clothing. 
I  was in charge of what was know
n as the camp commandant, and i t  
was quite fun. Well, fun 
isn't the word.  But it was very interesting. 

Q: We will have to
 turn over the tape.

Q :  Mr. Jenkins, what are some of  the re
flections that you have
 on the Belson camp ? 
A :  Well, the mo st obvious one, 
obviously, was its relationship 
to my being a  
conscientious 
objector. I  remember st andingin 
the c amp  ver y  early on and looking at the ter r ible --  and I  
guess the people who upset me  most in the 
camp  were the living because they - -  the 
walking dead as it were. Th
ey were so --  I  mean, ther
e were people w
ho had gone beyond 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
32 
the state o f  recovery. 
T h e dead w e re d ead and they  were
 inpeace.But 
th e -- an d the o n e s 
w h o  w e re - -  the surviv ors were
 getting out of the camp . But,
 inthe meantime, there were 
these thousands of peop
le dying. Andthey were thepeo p
le, I  guess, who upset me most 
because yo u see th em  walking aro und, walki
ng from nowhere to  nowhere, and then th ey 
would just  kind of fall down a
nd there you were. I  r eme mber 
thinking to myself, well, you 
know, while I  was working on the land and the 
sun was shining, but 
under this same sky 
only relativ ely a  few  miles aw ay, b ecau se E n gl
an d  isn 't  a l l th a t  far fro m Germany, these 
peoplewere living under the sa
me sky and comp aring the, 
you know, the fact that they 
wereso  ho peless and without
 any  -- any hope o f  being s a v e
d  o r  an y t h i n g  becau se, w ell, 
beforeth e war ended, I  mean , all thewhile th
e concentration camps we
re going, they were 
going on for eternity, I  me an, 
the people -- the Germans gave
 u p  the camps only when the 
war was at  their very doorstep. 
And so day after day these pe
ople were in this camp  and 
having to live under these terrible conditi
ons. And it made me think about being a 
conscientio us objector and refusing to particip
ate in the struggle. And I thought about it a  
great deal. The only thing I could -- the only c
onclusion I  kept on coming 
to  w as that I  still 
believed that war was not the 
answer. That there must b e  
some  other answer. And that 
eventually we had to ge
t -- we had to get rid of war as
 a  means o f  settling things.And the 
only way we wil l  do that i s if
 -- hopefully the next 
generation there will
 be  consc ientious 
people that feel the same  kind 
of mind and eventuallycome  
to a  time where p eople will 
say we  ar e not going t o  
have an army , we are 
not going to have arms
, there have to be 
other ways of settling our differen ces. A
nd that's  --  may seem
 kind of high- minded 
theory, but on the other hand, that
 was as farasI got
. I couldn't believe, I couldn't persuade 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
33 
my self that I  --  that i t  wa
s wrong, that I  should have been
 fighting instead
, been in the 
army instead. But -- 
Q :  And do you have some
 of those thoughts now? 
A :  No, except a  sense of desolati
on when I  see the way we seem 
to have -- still use war as 
a method of settling -- maybe that also has an
 argument in the fact that the third -- the 
Second World War didn't solve problems. Th
ere ar e just  as many problems in E u rope, 
people fighting each other. So, 
obviously, there mu st be some  
other way. But whatever the 
way was, it was too late
 to save al l  the people who were vi
ctims o f  th e Nazis. But th at may 
be rationalizing it, but, no, I  still
 think, I  still b elieve that wa
r is not - -  never will be an 
answer to our problems. 
Q :  Could we go back t o  a  summary of what
 you did from the time 
you were commandant 
of the Polish camp until you returned home? 

A: 
Yes .  
Well, I  was in  charge o f  th
at camp. Well, the 
team was in charge of the camp. But 
my particular job was 
kind of the chief administrator, 
I  guess, whatever you call it, which 
was kind of  fun beca
use it  put me i n  some very awkward 
situations . 
I  reme mb er the3,500 
Poles, we  had a  Poli sh police force of  young 
Poles who kind of ran 
the place, who looked 
after the security of 
the place. And, of course, we  had 
a  lot of young peopl
e in there. And 
one day there had been some fighting and the 
police brought these - -  ha
d to brea k it  up and 
they brought these young men in t o
 me  a s  ca mp administrato
r to be  punished. And so I  
gave them a  nice Quakerly 
lecture about we al
l ought to live toge
ther like we  were 
members of  a  family a nd things li ke that and 
sent them off. And a
bout five minutes la ter  
the head of  the police 
force, a  very nice young man, came 
in and said that
 the police force 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins  
34 
had resigned en masse. So I said, well, why? He
 said, look, we have this problem in the 
camp. We have a kind of a riot. 
We go in and break it  up. We 
get beaten up i n  the process. 
And eventually we manage to 
settle everything and 
we bring the ringleade
rs in t o seeyou, 
and you tap the m on the head and say, well
, g o  home and be good boys. That 's not going 
to  work. S o  I  consulte
d with my self and my 
friends and decided we would have to have 
some kind of system. AndsoI  
used to dock them their ci gare
tte rations and things like 
that. Which, of course, in t
hose days was cigarettes were  
a form of currency practically. 
Everybody loved to smoke. That was quite a  
punishment to be told you were losing one 
month's ration of cigarettes. Bu
t I  left the camp a
nd went back to England. Oh, i n  the 
meantime, my  wife h a d joined 
me because she was -- she al
so  b ec a me  a  memb er o f  th e  
Q u ak er elite and was trained  in
 the sa me  place where I  was trained. And then
 she was sent 
out to join me in
 the camp . And she was by that time 
a  very highly- qua
lified  an d very 
experienced nursery school teac
her and so she came and looke
d aft er the - - be cause  we 
had a  lot  of  children of  al l ages
,  little children in 
the camp , she set up th
e nursery school in 
the camp and she set 
it up so well that th
e U N RA, United Nations 
Rehabilitation Agency, 
were running a  lot of the camps, c a me  to 
our camp  and saw the nursery school and 
borrowed her and sent her to other camps to se
t up nursery schools. Then
 we both left and 
were assigned to this job of
 working with the y o ung Span
iards, w ell, al
l the Spanish 
refugees in the south of Fran
ce, because at the end o f  the 
Spanish Civil War there was a  
tremendous wave of  refugees 
who fled over the frontier into
 France. And wh
ile a  lot of 
them had gone back, a lot were still there. A
nd the ones th at were still there were very 
much in ne ed of vari
ous social services. We  had schools,
 retraining schools,
 and a  lot of 

Interview with Hugh Mo
ntfort Jenkins

activities like that. And so I wa
s i n  charge o f  that for six 
months. And then the Quakers 
brought me  back to London and 
I was the  oversea s se cre t ary for the European world. 
Q :  Was that a  full-time activity? 
A :  Oh, yeah, yeah. That was kind of --  I  wa
s responsible for al l  th
e work in Germany, 
Austria, Poland, wherever it was. 

Q :  And that was a  big job? 
A :  Well, yeah, except in the Quak er thing 
you had the responsibility, but you also -- you 
work very mu ch as a  group. We had a committee
 that was in charge, 
so -- so I  was the 
overseassecretary. I  also had a  
--  I  used  to  wo rk very c l o s
ely with the people in Friends 
House in London. But I  us
ed to ha ve to t ravel  to Poland 
to me et --  visit the teams. And 
then th e Friends Relief S e rv
ice wa s a  t empora r y organizati
on that --  i t  was kind of 
peculiar. T h e Friends i n  England did not have
 a permanent service 
group. What they did 
was to create a  group or
 a  service i n  time  of need. So, 
for example,  a s  I  re me mbe r, there  
w a s one Qu aker serv ice in  Ir
eland during the potato fami ne. 
There was one Quaker se rvice 
in the Fran co-Prussian  War. 
There was one Quaker service 
in the First World War. And 
there wa s one Quaker service 
in the Second World War. And 
the Quakerservicein the 
Second World War was - -  it was agreed, long be
fore the war ended i t
 was agreed that 
failing any other unforeseen events, that
 would come to an
 end in May 1948. 
Q :  And it was called the British -- 
A :  Friends Relief Service. A
nd it  was to come to
 an end in May 1948.
So that was the 
period that I  was the overseas 
secretary. 
So I  -- one of my jobs 
was going around to all the 
teams that we had in  Germany 
a n d  Austria and working out wi
th them the way they would

h a n d  ov er t h eir w o rk  t o  local sources. It w a
s a  difficult job because
 -- and everybodyfalls 
in love -- when you are in reli
ef work you fall in love with 
your work  and you fall in love 
with the people you are working wi
th. I  mean --  I  don't  me an fa
ll in  love with individuals, 
but you fall in love with the whol
e situation and your companions
 a nd the local --  and i t  i s 
very difficult to leave. You 
feel, you know, t h e job is not fi
nished, why should we have to 
leave? But, on the other hand, the 
Quakers, I  believe, felt very
 strongly that 
this was a  job 
that they had to do in time of
 need, but they weren't about 
to start a  permanent social 
service agency. Or they do have continuing 
programs right now that
 the British  and the 
American Quakers, you know, co
untries where  there  are - - wh
ere there i s need. And so I  
did that until May 1948. And th
en in May 1948 the Ame rican
 Friends Service Committee 
said, well, you've been working 
for British Friends Relief Se
rvice, and now that job is 
finished, why don't you come work
 with us for a  little whil
e. So I  came over from England 
technically for two years and 
worked in PhiladelphiA: And 
then I  was going t o  leave and 
they said we have a  very funny project in 
Washington. Wehave a  
house whic h was given 
to us to provide accommodation 
and that, kind of a  center fo
r  international students. So 
why don't you go and run that. So
 we came to Wash
ington in 1951 to run the International 
Student House, which we did for six years. 
And we never left. I  be
came -- I went from 
that to being the director of
 the  Foreign Student Service C
ouncil and from that to being -- 
Q :  Director of Foreign 
Student Service Council? 
A: ForeignStudentServic
e Council inWashington. 
Q :  Was that a  Quaker -- 
A :  No.The InternationalStude

ers, but it  is now run, I

think, b y  a  local co mmittee. The Q u ak ers may  
stil l own the building.
 But they pulled out 
the administration. When Iwent 
to  the International Student H
ouse, I  went a s  part of the 
American F riends Service Co
mmittee, so kind of employe
d from Philadelphia to come. 
But when I  left, i t  w as sometime 
after I left, itbecame-- they di
vested their direct interest, 
involvement, and had the local committee take it
 over, which it is still running, of course. 
It is a  very beautiful house on R  
Street. And then at  the time  
I  was leaving the International 
Student House there was a  feel
ing there w as a  great deal o f
 need fo r some service to  
foreign students who visited 
Washington on the basis of pr
actically ever
y student who 
comes to  the United S t ates will
 at  some time  during their st ay
 here want to come  to th e 
nation's capitol. So they star te
d the Foreign Student
 Service Council and I  wa s t h e direc tor 
of that,  per h aps ten years, I  guess. And then 
I  becametheex ecutive 
vice-presid ent o f  th e 
National Association for College Stude
nt Affairs. And 
then I retired. 
Q :  And were you --  did you at 
any time  become a  Quaker? 
A: Yes. 
Q :  Youdid? 

A :  Yeah. Not a  very active one, but 
I am a member of the Meeting. 
Q :  And what time --  a t  what point was that
 that you became a  memb
er of  the Meeting? 
A :  Well, now, I  was very mu ch involved, I  
think I  became a  membe r of the Me eting in 
Philadelphia. 
Q :  But you -- so you were  working 
for the m f o r a  few ye ars --  
A :  Yeah. 
Q :  -- before you became a  me mb er of the Meeting?

lief Service, in  o u r  t e am  I  
think only -- I  think the team l
eade r  and one other person were 
Quakers. But a  lot of them 
were --  sev eral o f  them w ere, 
I  think, kind of attenders but 
n o t me mb er s .  We

But ther e were others who we
re quite different. Like 
my self, I  was a  Baptist, 
son of a  Baptist minist
er. S o  there w e  a r e.  
Q :  Okay. Is there - -  is there anythi
ng else that you would like to add? 
A :  I  don't think so.
