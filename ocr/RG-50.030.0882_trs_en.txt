Q: And that was after you had already left school?  

A: It™s so hard to separate it exactly. 

Q: Oka y. Then it doesn™t matter. It doesn Œ in Œ in that sense, it doesn™t matter. It Œ 

what I™m after is, the incidents where you experienced them not speaking to you 
any more, can you t ell us more about that?  
A: It was j ust Œ we didn™t Œ we didn™t sta y in t he same places, we j ust  Œ the y didn™t

A: As a matter of fact, I was on a business trip with m y husband, to

And one of the girl s that had been m y friend, and was in school with me, had 

become a ve
ry famous actress. 
Q: No kidding? 

A: I saw her picture. And so, somebody asked me, did you contact her? It had gone 

through m y mind, and t hen I decided not to do it, because I didn™t want to be 

rejected. I di dn™t know how she felt.

A: Probably around that ti me. 
Q: Oka y, oka y. And so you never did cont act her? 
A: No. 

Q: Did the rejection ever come in a very obvi ous way? 

A: No, it was subt le. B ut you know, this is part of m y upbringing. My parents 

instilled a spirit in us that, no matter what happens to you, you™re still yourself. You 

don™t lose yourself, you don™t lose your value. And that™s what kept us going. 
Q: Those are very important lessons. 
A: Yes, very. 
Q: You know. 

A: And so I™m Œ you know, we™re so fortunat e. Not every child has that. 

Q: That™s ri ght, that™s right, th Œ the Œ you know, as we grow up, part of our answer

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ you™re sa ying your parents stres Œ stressed. 

A: By example. Not by lecturing. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: It Œ it helped me when I came to this country, which is, of course, much later, 

and we may come t o that. 

Q: Yes, yes. So, did your level of living change much in 1933 to ™36, those first 

years of 
Hitler
 being i n power? 

A: It did later on, yes, because for instance, you couldn™t have a mai d any more, that 

was under 45, because that™s when those Œ when the y coul dn™t have children any 
more, and t he y didn™t want to work for Jews. So we had a part ti me maid, over 46. 
Q: I see. I see. 

A: And our apartment was smaller by then, because m y mother couldn™t take care 

of anything big. And I guess the mone y wasn™t there either, I don™t  know.  

Q: Oka y. Were your parents less Œ  how was their manor? Did their manor change, 

as time went on? Were the y less happy? Were they more worried?

Germany

happened around that time, I wanted to go Œ I wanted to leave so badly. And I was a 
stamp collector at the time. One Sunday afternoon I was l ooking at my stamps, and 

I found an envelope that m y uncle had given me, that came from 
America
, and it 

had an American stam p on it, addressed to hi m, and he gave it to me because I Œ he

Q: Oka y. Before 
Kristallnacht

A: I know. I know. 

Q: Oh, yeah. 

A: And I™m Œ I™m t rying to pinpoint it, and I have not been able to Œ t o get the Œ 

give the exact date. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Well, when the affidavit came, you have a quota number. And it was a very high 
number, there were a l ot of people ahead of us. So I said to hi m Œ my father, I said, I 
don™t want to sta y and wait here and ma ybe not get out. He had a friend in 
Londo n
, 
and that friend had a friend Œ an English friend, who was in amer Œ who was a 

Quaker, a British Quaker. And he t old hi m Œ he said to m y father™s friend, we™ve 

been thinking what we can do for German Jews, and ma ybe this is somet hing we 

can do. Maybe we can take one of them. And i t so happened Œ you know, life is so 

strange that way Œ so happened that  an Ameri can qua Œ the head of the

 to find out what was

and m y mother spoke a little bit. So she made coffee, and we talked. And later on he 
went back and he told t hem that our family was fine. So the y sai d they would take 
one of us. 

Q: Did your sister want to go as much as you did? 

A: I guess. I think. Wel l, we were a pair, anyway. So we send Œ we wrote to them, 

and we sent our pictures, both of us. And as they t old us l ater one when the y saw
