Question: This is the

conducted by 
Peggy Frankston
, with 
Andre
, 
Lucie
 and 
Joyce
, who were born 
Za l c
. All brother Œ a brother and two sisters,
 and it™s going to  be Œ and it™s on July 
23
rd
, 2009, in 
New York City
, and it™s a continuation of the three separate 
interviews that were just done, talkin
g about wartime experiences, and perhap s 
some of the experiences after the war, or 
some experiences before the war. So, I™d 
like to start with some of the things
 that you know about your parents. 
A: Yeah, so, my mother, she cam
e from a family living in Œ in 
Latv ia
, and Œ not in 
Riga
, she was 
Ventspila
(ph). That™s a different city, it™s a ha-harbor in 
La tvia
. And 
she had two brothers, and t-tw
o sisters. And they owned a 
Œ a farm of cattle, a cattle 
farm up there. But Œ and of course in 
Latv ia
 th ere was a Œ a certain amount of 
Jewish population. And that way 
Latv ia 
also was a Œ belonged to 
Russia
, but 
before it belonged to 
Russia
, was a part of 
Germany
, was a colony of 
Germany
. 
And the people spoke German, and later 
they learned Russian from the Russian 

occupation, or beca Œ the Russian got the 
Œ got the territory. And she Œ her Œ they 
were selling cattle to 
Finland
 and  
Sweden
 and everywhere. But then the Œ the tsar 
of 
Russia
 had a brother and his name was 
Peter
. And when they went Œ they  went 
in war with 
Germany
, a Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 there were Œ he Œ he was afraid of the 
Jewish population because in those days th
e Jews were friendly with the Germans,

and they  spoke Yiddish, wh ich is an Œ an old German. It™s a dialect of 
Germany
 
from Œ from 500 years ago. So
 Peter 
decided, with his brother, the tsar of 
Russia
, 
they decided to Œ to  take the Jews 
and send them to the other part of 
Russia
 by the 
I-Iranian border, by the 
Caspia n Sea
, by 
Azrahan
(ph), by 
Baku, Azrahan
(ph). 
And they  were sent there. And up there they
 Œ they started a new life, with different 
busin esses to surviv e. And the gr Œ the 
grandfather, my mother™s father started 
because there Œ up there is a 
lot of fish. The Œ the caviar
 comes from there, and the 
Œ and the best fish. And the oils from 
the whales, too, which was like, very 
important in those days. So he start the 
factory of smoking fish, and he was very 
successful with that because in those days
, in the first W o rld War, the Russian army 
had no C-rations like today, 
and they used to  u-use a piece of smoked fish and a 

piece of bread. That was the food of th
e Russian soldier. And 
Œ and he couldn™t 
produce enough smoked fish 
for the government, so we™re Œ the govern ment wanted 
they should produce more fi
sh, they™re work ing day and 
night. So he complained 
about it. So they told  him, don™t wo rry abou
t it, if you™re short of labor, we give you 
work ers. So they gave him Turkish pris
oners and German prisoners and Austrian 
prisoners from the first World 
War, and they  used 
to work in the fa
ctory helping to 
smoke the fish. And Œ and tw
o prisoners fell in love w
ith my  aunts, and they  
married my  aunts, and when  the revolution of 
Russia 
started, the war with the

Germans and Russians stopped, because the 
Germans made the Russian revolution, 
I don™t know if you know th
at, yeah. Because they got 
Lenin
 in 
Switzerland
, and 
they gave him money and th ey send him back to 
Russia
 to  make the revolution. 
And wh en th ey made the revolution, th
e war stopped. So those Œ those two 
prisoners took their wives with them to 
Germany
, and then went to 
United States
. 
And one uncle Œ an aunt went to 
Belgium
. And my  mo ther, she was young and she 
wasn™t mar ried, so she stayed
 with Œ with her folks, and 
the two brothers went to the 
Russian army. And after the 
war, my mother was the only
 daughter home with the Œ 
with the two brothers. They  went back to 
Latv ia
 from 
Azra ha n
(ph). But the 
parents died  in 
Azrahan
(ph). They got Œ what™s 
that disease? The fever Œ 
L: Typhoid? 
A: Huh? 

L: Typhoid? 
A: Typhoid. They got 
typhoid, and they di
ed from that disease. Typhus, that™s 
called, and a Œ typhoid, yeah, in English. So
 they died from th
at disease, so my  
mother became an orphan. So
 the Russians go Œ the Ru
ssian government gave a 
visa, as was already after the revolution, 
b-because she was an orphan, they  gave a 
visa to go to her sister™s. One lived in the 
States 
and one lived in 
Belgium
. So sh e 
went to 
Belg ium
 to go to the 
States
, and by going to 
Belg ium
, she stayed by that

, he couldn™t get the birth certificate, he 
had to go back to 
Poland
 to serve in the reserve. In 
Poland
, after the Œ after the Œ 
being in the army , he has to be four or 
five years in the reserve. So h-he Œ he 
couldn™t go back there because 
he was married, he had no 
way of going back there. 
So he couldn™t get ma
rried officially in 
Belg ium
, so he was just married by the 
Jewish law, yeah. So Œ 

L: But he was from 
ód

the Polish lost the war, and the Russian

And things got very bad in 
Poland

to get even for their train,

men, who went to see their husbands in 
Italy
