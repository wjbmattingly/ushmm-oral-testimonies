T hank you,Estelle, so m uchf or joining us and being wi lling to be our 
Fi rs t  P e rs o n
 
today, traveling inf rom Chicago to join us.
 
You have just som uch to try to tell
 
news a short 
period so we wil l start right away.
 
 
You were just 10 inW arsaw whenW arIIbegan with Germany's invasionof  Poland 
September
 
1,  19 3 9
. B
ef ore we turn toall that would happen to youand yourfam ily during the 
war and the Holocaust, startf irst with a littlebit about yourfam ily, and you, and your lif ebefore 

the war began.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Iwas born inW arsaw, Poland
,  
to a m iddle
-
c la s s  f a m ily
. I
n m y selective 

 
3
 
m em ory were glo ws in radiance of  lilactreesagainst openblue skies
,  
with soun
d s of  go od  
neighbors
, fabulous cousins and fam ily, 
kindness and trust and love.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From what you've told m e and what I read in your book, yourf ather
 
--
 
you were 
extrem ely close to your father.
 
T ell usa littlebit about him.
 
>> Estelle Laughl
in :
 
W ell, m y father was a very nurturing, a ver y
 
--
 
o ur parents imprinted 
them selves on us.
 
And m y father taught me m y values, taughtm e to trust, taught me to love.
 
He taught me to em brace all of hum anity.
 
T hat trust, that love, that foundation helped me 
survi ve with love and com passion and joy of  life.
 
Life should be livedjoyfully.
   
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your mother f led f rom
 
violence and anti
-
Sem itism  inRussia, hadn't she? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
My m other ref lected the Jewish people.
 
Persecution isnot new to Jewish 
people.
 
Jewish people were chased f rom
 
--
 
they were welcom ed and started life one year and 
thenext year they wer e kickedout.
 
Andm y m other was raised in a shtetle ina small town in 
Ru s s ia .
 
She was kicked out duringW orldW ar I and cam eto Polan
d.
 
She alsotaught me 
co m pa ssio n.  
Even though she was persecuted, she would tell us that the Russian peoplewere 
ver y suff ering people.
 
So she was also very c om passionate and loved nature and impressed 
that on us, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hen Germ any invaded 
Poland September
 
1,  19 3 9, st a r t i n g W or l d W a r  I I ,  
W arsaw was attackedthat very day.
 
W hat do you rem em ber of thatf irst day andthen of the 
siege of W arsaw thatfollowed? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
So the sad thing for the day was that the people in Poland were 
awar e 
that we were threatened.
 
W e heardabouttheNazi aggressions, invasion of Sudetenland.
 
W e 
felt that we were so preparedf or war yet war was an abstraction.
 
 
T he very f irst day it was a peaceful,beautif ulday and suddenly there was this 
trem endous explosionas though all theair was sucked outof  the world.
 
T he earth trem bled.
 
And then there was silence.
 
And then sirensand we turnedonthe radioand we heardthe 
announcement that bom bs were dropped onW arsaw andthat we were at war without 

declaring 
wa r .
 
And ina few seconds I changedf rom  being a childtobeing anadult and 
carryin g the burdens that war puts on children.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Still,W arsaw held outf or a full m onthfollowing the Germ an invasion of Poland.
 
You wrote thataf ter the Germ an Arm y marched intoW arsaw on October
 
1, 1939, imm ediately 
" My lif e changedbeyond imagination."
 
Tell us about those changes.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W ell, I turned10 when Germany invaded Poland.
 
Im me d iat e ly m y lif e  
changed beyond recognition.
 
My once peaceful streets were now patrolled byf oreign soldiers.
 
T hey shouted insults and cruelties.
 
T hey snapped whips in ourhomes and streets.
 
They 
isolated us ina tiny ghettoand built a thick wall around us.
 
T heyf illed the ghetto with people 
driven outf rom  surrounding areas.
 
Most people cam e on foot
, m
ost without apenny in their 
pocket, many without shoes on their feet.
 
Most died of  coldandhunger andT yphus
. I
n the 
stre e ts
, p
eople covered the bodies of dead people with posters sayi ng " Our children must live,"  
" Ch i
ldren are the holiest things."
 
 
Yet, in this inferno people f ought heroically to holdonto their values to holdon to the 
m eaning that was m ost essential to us.
 
To own abook was an act of def iance, was considered 
a capital crim e yetall over the ghetto people had secret 
lib rarie s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather was one of  them , right? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
My f atherhad a stash of his f avorite books by Yiddish authors, by 
Shalom  Aleichem  andShalom  Asch.
 
Nightswindo ws blinded with covers to keep our e
xistence 
secret in a sm all room  illum inated by 
carbide
 
li g h t .
 
W ehad no electricity.
 
M y f ather would pull 

 
4
 
outa stash of hisbooks and read tous,bringing to lif e rem ote worlds.
 
 
W eeven had theaters.
 
I didn'tm entionthat the Jewish comm unity im mediately
 
organized itself into awidespread self
-
aid center to supportand help the neediest am ong us.
 
And the self
-
aid center supported theater.
 
T heaters
,  
im aginetheaters when we had no bread.
 
 
T here was a wonderful author andhistorian in theW arsaw Ghetto.
 
His
 
name was 
Chaim Kaplan andhesaid that it is remarkable when we don't seem to need it at all, we need 
poetry m ore than we needbread.
 
And it istrue.
 
I thinkour souls need to benourished.
 
I think 
our ability to express ourselves, to thinkf orourselves is our 
G o d l i nes s
.  
 
Gunshovering over our heads didnot stop us f rom  celebrating holidays.
 
W e pulled 
the window shades down and we celebrated.
 
All over the ghettoheroic teachersm et with 
children in little room s andtaught them tohold on totheir im aginations and trust and love.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And all of  that, the theater and the poetry, was all done clandestinely.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Itwas all doneat the risk
 
--
 
it was a capital crime.
 
Capital offense, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Intheghetto there was a large wall built around the ghetto to enclose you.
 
Can 
y
ou say a little bit about that? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W ell, im aginethat your horizon is closed, that you are imprisoned.
 
T here 
isn't really m uchm ore to say than how terribly undignif ied the slum of  l
if e  was .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I was struck, Estelle, by som ething you wrote.
 
You wrote that children followed 
adultexam ples to resist barbaric laws.
 
" In ourapartm ent com plex there was no childover 10 
who did not have some public duty."
 
Can you say m ore about
 
t h at ? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
W ell, we are shaped by our comm unity.
 
And as I pointed out, there 
was trem endousmoral resistance.
 
Our childrenm odeled the behavior of  adults.
 
W e h i d o ur  
booksunder our clothes.
 
You know, now I recognize what the heroic act it was but we as 
children did not give it a secondthought.
 
Butwe did walk by
 
--
 
you know, we knew if  we were 
caught, we would be shot, our parents wouldbe shot,and so wouldour teachers.
 
 
And children volunteered
 
--
 i
nm y book I describe how children collected clothes and 
food and put on shows, and raised moneyf orneedier children.
 
So there was a tremendous 
m orale resistance inholding on to one's self .
 
 
Another interesting thing about the ghetto was
 
--
 
I m ay be incorrectbut I think that 
we were 
allowed like 81
-
calories a day.
 
But I am  not sure about the number.
 
B u tI kno w th a t it 
was less than10%of  the requiredm inim um  daily calorie need.
 
And there was sm uggling.
 
W e 
were com pletely enclosed by the wall and there was a curf ew.
 
W e were constantly
 
watched.
 
But yet there was smuggl ing.
 
 
And you know, children no olderthan 8 or 10
-
year
-
old kids would sm uggle
 
--
 
would 
rem ove bricksf rom  the wall and do smuggl
ing.
 
And the wall, of  course, was stained with blood.
 
If the child was caught, there was
 
--
 i
f he managed to get through, there was foodf or theday.
 
T here was alsom ore
 
--
 
there was also larger
-
scale smuggling.
 
And that was doneby bribery, 
the Nazi guardsf illed their pockets with bribery.
 
So there was som etrade, som eblackm arket 
trade in the 
ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hichis how you were able to survi ve.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
And this is how we were able to survi ve, m any of  us.
 
Most were not.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The Nazis started deporting large num bersof  Jews outof W arsaw to the 
concentration cam ps in 1942.
 
For aperiod of tim e yourfamily was able to avoid being 
deported.
 
How were your parentsabletom anage to keep youf rom being taken by the Nazis 
andhow did you survive during that tim eof all of  those deportations? 
 

>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
I n J u
ly
 
1942, the month of  m y 13th birthday, the infamous deportations of  

 
5
 
the W arsaw Ghetto began.
 
W e hadno idea that the deportationsmeant death.
 
W e were told 
that we were to be resettled.
 
Some Jewish people were forced to writef alse letters to their 
f a m ili
es, inviting them  to places where they weref ed and shelteredandtaken care of.
 
So you 
can imagine thatm any destitutepeoplem arched willingl y in an unknowing death.
 
 
W arsaw was an ancient city.
 
Most people lived inapartm entbuildings.
 
So where 
does one
 
hide in an apartm ent building?
 
Pretty m uch where children play hide and go seek.
 
W ehid behind couches.
 
Peoplehid under beds.
 
T hey hid in cardboard cupboards, indrawers.
 
T hey hid wherever they could vanishf rom sight.
 
My fam ily, we obscured one room  by putting a 
wardrobe inf ront of the door.
 
 
W hile we were hiding, between July
 
1942 and Septem ber
 
1942, in the near two 
m onths,99% of the children disappeared.
 
Can you im agine a world without the soundof  
children
, w
ithout the presence of mother, grandmothers and grandfathers?
 
Because old people 
and children were thefirst to be killed.
 
I was am ong the1% of children still alive.
 
And we never 
heardf rom the peoplewho were dragged away, but af ew peoplemanagedto come under the 
cover of the night back to the ghettoand they told us about these horrendous train rides to a 

place calledT reblinka where our people were gassed.
 
 
It is sohardfor me to im agine that anyone who loves their m othersandfathers and 
children can do such a horrendousthing.
 
T h is is  wh
y I'm  here to share this story.
 
And I believe 
thatthis is why you are all here.
 
Because question
 
--
 
we have to be rem inded f rom  time to tim e 
thathum an beings arecapable of such utter cruelty
 a
nd in the recognition appreciate so much 
m orethe value and the im portance of love.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Estelle, as you just said, 99% of  the children were gone.
 
The Nazis had 
essentially decreed that childrenunder the age of 14 were useless to them.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were 13.
 
>> Estelle Lau
gh lin :
 
I was 13.
 
My f ather thought what would happen if  they would com e after 
m ebecauseI was contraband,forbidden to exist.
 
And m yf ather said, well, if they come after 
you, I'll burn their eyes out with acid
; 
I won't let them take you away f rom m e.
 
I b
elieved him  
thatI was saf e if only in his love.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At some point, Estelle, you and your fam ily were still in the ghetto.
 
It had been 
divided, I think in1943, into three sub
-
ghettos.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You went to work in a Germ anf actory.
 
W ill y
ou tell us about that? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ok .
 
There were justafew Jewish people whowere allowed to exist and 
they were classif ied as the useful ones andthe others were contraband, weref orbidden to 

e xi s t .
 
And, of  course, t
hey were called the wild ones.
 
Now, atthat point inthe ghetto mostof  
thepeople were deported.
 
T he deportations were carriedout with 20th Century know
-
ho w and 
stone age values people disappeared intremendous num bersevery day.
 
I think towards the 
end 
it was like 2,000 people a day.
 
 
If orgot the question. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You weref orced to go to wor k in afactory.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Righ t .
 
Sothepeople who were legal, a ver y sm all num ber, were 
em ployed
 
--
 
there were three sub
-
ghettos.
 
So the ghetto
 
was virtually deserted.
 
It was like a 
haunted place.
 
It was so quiet.
 
I remember
 
--
 
we li ved in anapartm ent building
. W
e were the 
only f am ily in theentire apartm entbuilding still alive.
 
I would sometimes walk out into the 
courtyard and openthe gateand listen,hoping thatI would hear asound of life,of  a neighbor, 

 
6
 
of  a f riend.
 
T he silence was so palpable it was crawlin g at us.
 
 
Now, the people, there were three sub
-
gh e t t os .
 
And the people whowere allowed to 
live, the useful ones, worked inafactory
.  
My m other, sister, and I weref ortunateenough to 
work, without any pay.
 
It was a privilege because you were legally al ive.
 
So we worked in one 
of  those shops,m ending uniform s. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
German uniform s.
 
 
As the ghetto was being liquidated orm oreand more deportations, and it was 
em ptying out, yourf amily m oved and createda bunker on the groundf loorof .
 
Tell us about it.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Righ t .
 
Now, at the pointwhen the people,the rem ainderof  thepeople, 
becam eaware of T reblinka, they began to organize them selves toarm ed resistance.
 
A t  th a t 
pointorganizing yourself in arm ed resistance m ade sense.
 
So they built anetwork of bunkers.
 
My f ather was am em ber of  theunderground
, so we 
m o ve
d  
f rom ourapartm ent on the second 
f loor tothe groundf loor so that we couldbuild a bunker, 
to o. 
 
 
So they built anetwork of  bunkers.
 
And they also dug tunnels between thebunkers 
for navigation.
 
T hey also builta tunnel underthe wall in order to getto the Christian side and 
get arm s f rom  the Christian
 
underground.
 
They also used the sewer.
 
The sewer was a ver y 
usef ul m eans of  communication.
 
 
So we had abunker.
 
The entrance to our bunker had tobe, of  course, secret.
 
So the 
trap door was thepowder room f loor, less 
com m o de  
and all.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A ll
 
under the com mode.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Righ t .
 
And ourexistencewould be in this netherworld.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And once theW arsaw uprising began, which was an extraordinary event, there 
you were hiddenaway.
 
W hat was it likef or you in thebunker?
 
W hat  w
as that like? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
I n A p r i l
 
1943, events erupted that Nazi tanks, arm ored cars, bomber 
planes, with
 
hum ungous loud speakersannouncing that we better all reportf or resettlement.
 
Of course, we knew what resettlem entm eant so when we heard 
t hat ,  we  l i f t ed  ou r  t r a p d oor,  
went down tof lim sy ladder into thedism albasem ent,pulled the trap door down.
 
I fe lt 
abandoned.
 
T he ceiling pressed down on m e.
 
The dam p f loor
 
--
 
wall s closed in on me.
 
T he 
f lic k
ering of the carbide lights was our substitutefor the sun.
 
T he ticking of the clock was our 
only clue when morning was rising and nightwas f alling.
 
Thefew people in the bunker with us 
was m y whole nation.
 
 
W hile we were in thatbunker,f ighting brokeout in the streetsf acing a 20th Century 
A r m y,  
arm ed f rom  head to toe, f acing arm ored cars, tanks, bom ber planes.
 
It was ahandful of  
poorly arm ed, poorly clad,poorly fedf reedom f ighters.
 
T hey clim bed upon rooftops they 
stepped inf ront of open windows, clim bed out of  thebunkers,facedthe tanksand bombs 

falling, incendiary bombs.
 
 
W hat is rem arkable is that ittook
 
--
 
the f reedom  f ighters, the handful of  f ighters 
fought longer than it took France or Poland to capitulate.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e that when the edict was gi ven to abolish the ghetto, itwas 
to be done in threedays as a gif t to Hitlerf orhis birthday and ittook 30days, took am onth to 

accomplish.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Righ t .
 
In January
 
1943, there were afew skirm ishes.
 
T he deportations 
were resum ed but thefreedomf ighter
s put on a f ight and they f ought for f our days.
 
T h e 
Germ ans were completely unpreparedfor it, so they withdrew.
 
A n d Him m le r p rom is ed  Hit le r 
that for his birthday he 
would deliver within three days 
--
 
the presentwould be to cleanse 
W arsaw of  all Jewish pe
ople.
 
So it was cleansed inthree days.

>> Bill Benson:
 
How were youf ound, Estelle?
 
You were in a bunkerbuteventually you wer e 
found.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
At some pointa grenade was thrown at the
 c
eiling over us and we wer e 
dragged out.
 
A tth at p oin t t
here was noplace to hide anym ore.
 
They dragged us out into the 
st re e t s.  
Thebuildingswere crum bling to ourfeet,enorm ous tons offlam es were licking thesky 
andpainting it in other worldl y colors of  iridescence, plum esof  sm oke.
 
And they dragged us to 
Um schlagplatz.
 
W e did notm arch like a storm of  namelesspeopleof we were people with 
dream s, people with hope.
 
Children sometimes asked m ehow didfeel inside and Itell them  
thatIf elt no differentthan they feelor m y grandchildrenfeel.
 
I, too, wanted to catch a ball 
f lying in theair.
 
I, too,wanted tof eel the damp grass under m yf eet.
 
I, too , wa n ted  to ta ke m y 
fam ily and m y f riends for granted, as all the people should.
 
And they m archedus to 
Um schlagplatz
 
in congealed blood,people incongealed bloodall around us.
 
They loaded us 
on tof reight trains.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And f rom  there 
you 
ould go toMajdanek.
 
T ell usabout going to Majdanek and 
about your f ather.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W ell, Majdanek, we arrived after a night ride in the car in af reigh
t tra in.
 
T hey were pelting just for the sport bullets into the cars thatpeoplewere all aroundus.
 
Majdanek, the thornsof  
electrif ied
 
barbed
-
wir ef encesm arked the end of our horizon.
 
In f ro n t 
of  us was the crem atorium  andthe chimneys andthe smokeand 
t he s t e n ch  of  h um an f l e sh.
 
And if that wasn't enough, in the assembly f ield there was a gibbetf rom  which, gallows f rom  
which our people were hanging.
 
Andm y f ather was gassed there.
 
My m other, sister, and I
 
--
 
I 
was 13.
 
My sist e r wa s 1 4
 
1/2 years old.
 
M y 
f ather was gassed.
 
 
My m other was theonly m other that I am aware of .
 
W e were theonly f amily of three 
people, which made us ver y, ver y f ortunatebecauseeveryone else,as f ar as I know, was 

alone.
 
My m other,m y sister and I survived Majdanek by af luke o
f  luck.
 
My sister was beaten 
ver y badly and she was puton a list.
 
Our assum ption was that her nam e on the list indicated 
that she was to go tothe gas chamber.
 
The three of ushad apact that if one of us wouldbe 
gassed, all three of  us would go.
 
It wa s 
m ore f rightening to us to be separated than facing 
death.
 
I knowf orm e,m y f eeling was that
 
--
 
I didn'tunderstand what death was but I wanted so 
m u ch 
--
 
m y biggest dream at that point was to m ake the transitiontodeath holding on tom y 
m other's hand and
 
m y sister's hand.
 
So theonly logical thing was f or m y m other andm eto 
tradeplaces with two other wom en who hoped to seeanother sunrise.
 
 
And thefollowing day when thenam es werecalled,m y sister's name, and then the 
names of the two other wom en,m y m other and I reported with the groupof people.
 
A n d 
absolutely sure that we are being walked to the gas cham ber but instead we were loaded on to 

af reight train and taken toSkarzysko.
  
 
T here was an 
d is t
inction between an exterm ination camp and slave labo
r c amp . .
 
An  
exterm ination cam p was afactory of  killing people.
 
A slave labor cam ppeople also died but 
f rom extrem e labor, lack of food.
 
Slave labor cam ps also were enclosed by electrif ied 
barbed
-
wire f ences and towers with guards and dogs, Germ anShepher
ds
. T
o this day I'm 
af r a i d  of  do gs .
 
And lights thatf ollowed every s tep that we took.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Let me ask you onem ore question about Majdanek.
 
I believe it was at 
Majdanek you had a photograph of your father.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:
 
Tell uswhat happened.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W hen we were unloaded off thef reight trainsand marched, I was sure 

 
8
 
that we were going to the gas chamber.
 
W e were given the soap, had to gothrough showers, 
the showers of  disinfectant.
 
W e were sure that it was death.
 
W e didn't scream.
 
W e didn't cry.
 
Not because
 
--
 
it's almost like people
 
--
 
when you have an incurable illness, you want tomake 
your death
 
--
 
you want tof ace your death with dignity.
 
I didn't cry becauseI didn't want to really 
show m y tears to
 
m y enem ies or tom y punishers.
 
Ididn't cry because I wanted to protectm y 
m other and sister.
 
 
So I digress.
 
So whenwe were m arched to the showers not knowing 
f
or sure that 
we'll be gassed, I still had our clothes on andshoes.
 
I hadone treasure lef t, which was a 
photographerof m y father that I had in the lining of  m y shoe.
 
I was a 13
-
year
-
o ld  girl.
 
A soldier 
stoppedm e and he says, "W hat are youhiding?"
 
I said," I'm  not hiding anything."
 
He  s a id, " I  
know you're hiding som ething."
 
So  I th ou gh t if  I'll 
be  t r ut hf u
l
, I'll have the best chance of saving 
the photograph of  m y father.
 
SoI said yes and I showed him the photograph.
 
A nd  he  
conf iscated it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From there,as you said, youwere sent toSkarzysk o.
 
T here was an incident 
on your way to Sk
a rzysko .  
T ell us about that.
 
You were in the train.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Oh .
 
Random  luck.
 
W hen we were on thef reight train transportedf rom  
Majdanek toSkarzysk o, m y sister hadto go to the bathroom.
 
So atsom e point there was a pit 
stop.
 
My m otherand Ipleaded with m y sister, oh, don't go because they m ight shoot you 
because there were the soldiers just shooting for thefun inthe air or who knows at whom .
 
B u t 
m y sister said," I have to go,"  so we didn't want to part and we went with her.
 
Then they start
ed 
to shootto chase us into the train.
 
W e ran to the train but we entered a different car.
 
 
Skarzysko hadthree different cam ps.
 
And one cam p it was an arm am entf actory 
where bullets were being produced.
 
And onecam p they were workin g on gunpowder which 
settled on the lungs and in the skin.
 
And thepeople who ended up in that particular cam p lived 
only like a month or at m ost two m onthsbecause they suff ocatedf rom  the gunpowder.
 
A nd 
because we went toadifferent train than we originall y were
 
--
 
>> B ill 
Benson:
 
W hichwas by accident.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
By accident.
 
W eendedup in the camp thatdidnot work on gunpowder.
 
So that, too, was one ofthe random  eventsthat accountedf or our survi val.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From what you told us already today,f rom what you wrote about, it's just such 
an understatem ent to say that your mother was a rem arkable wom an.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Therewas an incident where she conf ronted one of the guards, which I think 
was instrum ental in saving your sist
e r' s  lif e .
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W ell, not really.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok. 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Not really.
 
It wa s ju st that
 
--
 
the camp was located at som edistancef rom  
the factory.
 
Soof  course, we never saw m uch of the daylight.
 
W e worked f rom  early m ornin
g 
t ill la t e  a t n igh t .
 
 
You know, in thism useum, when you walk out you will see thatthere is a sky light, 
the ceiling, which is really no accident
. 
I'm  digressing here but it just strikes me because when 
we were walkin g
 
--
 
I'm  a little bit coherent butit
 
wil l all m ake sense in a m inute.
 
W hen we were 
walkin g f rom  the camp to thefactory, all I remem ber was darkness.
 
Andall I rem em ber was 
thepatch of sky that was m y only connectiontof reedom ,to lif e.
 
And I thought I was the only 
one who rem em bered the p
atch of sky but the architect who builtthis m useum  interviewed 
survi vors and apparently m ost of the survi vors  rem em beredthat patch of  sky.
 
And this is why 

 
9
 
we have this hereat the museum .
 
 
So, as we m archedonthis darkplacef rom work to camp, there was
 
one kapo, a 
Jewish guard.
 
T he Germ ans told him to hit som ebody.
 
Andm y m other stepped out of the line 
and she said" One Jew does not hurtanother Jew.
 
If  you touch him, your blood will r ise f rom  
the grave and you will never know peace
. "  
So she had
 
--
 
m y s
isterandI thought she was 
absolutely m ad.
 
W ell,we were in shock.
 
That was m y m other's courage.
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
AtSkarzysko you, your sister and yourm other were referred to by the other 
inm ates as the threemonkeys.
 
You thoughtabout using that as
 
the title of  your book at one 
point.
 
W hy did they refer you as the threem onkeys? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
W e were theonly fam ily of three inthe group.
 
W esurvi ved as one 
organism .
 
W e were covered with lice.
 
W e were covered with m ange.
 
And we picked liceo
ff 
one another.
 
So we were just clinging so together.
 
So it was the people, our friends, our 
Holocaust bunker
 
--
 
Im ean cam p sisters affectionately called us the threem onkeys.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From Skarzysko you were then sent to Czestochowa.
 
And f rom  ther
e you 
would be liberated.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout your liberation.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
So that's January
 
1943.
 
W e we r e s o
 
--
 
that was f rom Septem ber
 
1939 to 
January
 
1943.
 
W e were so isolated.
 
W em ight as well have been ona
 
different planet.
 
W e 
could not im agine that only a f ew rabbit h
opsaway
 
f rom  us people were sailing on silver lakes 
and children sataround tables withf am ilies as children should.
 
Andthen suddenly one night 
we hear the rumbling ofplanes and we hear bom
b s f a llin g.
 
W e  s a y 
could it be af ter all of  these 
years?
 
Could it be?
 
And we were liberated that morning.
 
 
T hat was the m iddleof January.
 
Poland is quite cold.
 
T he ground was covered with 
snow and ice.
 
All we had on was a loose cap.
 
Amazing how m uch hunger and starvation, 
abuse humanbeings can endure and still remain humanbecause we did survi ve with love for 
humanity and com passion and joy of  lif e.
 
T he ground was covered with snow and ice.
 
T he 
wooden clogs, no underwear, f reezing.
 
W e sh uf f l ed  ou t of
 
--
 
we saw the gates were o
p en,  
wh ic h  in  it s e lf , 
was intoxicating.
 
T he camp was surroundedby a nom an's land.
 
W e sh uf f l ed  
out in the ice.
 
W e were so af raid because this was thef ront lines
. W h
at if the Nazis
 
--
 
what if  
the German forces com e back?
 
I t  wa s  lik e
 
in a nightm are when you think that you want torun 
and you cannotm ove.
 
 
W e shuff led.
 
We
 
wentoutand moved very, very gingerl y, listening.
 
W e he a r d t he  
t a n ks.  
W eheard sounds of  soldiers.
 
W e listened.
 
And then when we recognized that they were 
Russian soldiers andwe rushed towards them  like one istom eet them essiah.
 
W e r un  up  t o  
them  and we said, Oh, do you know how long we've been waiting f or you?
 
And they puto
u t 
their handsand they said, S
or
ry, but we have a war to fight.
 
Andthey did because this
 
wa s  
January.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
January
 
1945.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
1945.
 
Andthe war wasn't over until May.
 
So they looked at their watches 
-
- 
they gave us a slabof bread.
 
T hey lookedat their watchesand they said you bet
ter f ind 
shelter bef ore curf ew. 
I d
on't know at this point if I was more af raid of dying of  cold and 
starvation or of being put in jailfor breaking our curf ew.
 
So wef ound shelter in an abandoned 
school.
 
It was not easy.
 
 
From  1945 to1947 we were statelessand hom eless, and roam ing through Poland.
 
W e were not welcom ed.
 
Many Polishpeoplewere afraidthat the Jewish peoplem ight reclaim  

 
10
 
m aybe som e properties.
 
A n ti
-
Sem itism  andprejudice against any people is pretty com mon 
ever ywhere, which is one of the reasons why this museum exists.
 
T hi s  
is oneof  the reasons 
wh y I'm  hereto sharem y story
, t
o rem indm yself and all of us that hum anity is one.
 
 
So we m archedthrough Poland, through Czechoslovakia atthat time, through 
Germ any andeventually cam e tothe UnitedStates.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
There's
 
so much, som uch, that I wish we had the tim efor you to tell us, 
including what you did during theperiod you're describing now.
 
But if  youdon'tm ind, I would 
like you to share the incident whereearly af ter your liberation and you're trying to m ake it,
 
you're with your m om and your sisterand your m otherbuys a single piece of candy.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Oh .
 
W ell,  a ll of  t ha t  is a m o ut hf u l.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Can you give a sneakpreview?
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Ye s .
 
W e  we r e
 
wandering through Poland f irst.
 
It
 
was winter.
 
T here were 
no DP camps,displaced persons cam ps, we were com pletely on our own, not a penny, not a 
home to com e backto.
  
 
Rem ind me of the question again.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your motherbuying a piece of candy.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
So m y mother
 
--
 
and we are af raid that we'll be stuck inthis country that 
doesn't want us.
 
W e did not want
 
--
 
m y m other had siblings in the United States.
 
O u r d ream 
was to somehow establish contact with them andto come here.
 
Sowe hopped trains.
 
I 
hopped, m y mother hopped, andm y sister hopped trains.
 
W e went to lookfor fam ily.
 
So we 
were on our way andwe cam e to atown, Kelce.
 
And there was amarket.
 
And we hadn't seen 
that m uch food, carrots, beets.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you had nom oney.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Potato
es, no m oney, and candy.
 
W e had maybe
 
--
 
I think we found afew 
pennies, af ew pennies.
 
And we looked atall of thisfood and we are so hungry.
 
A n d  it ' s  s t ill 
winter.
 
M y m other says we have a 
--
 
we have afew cents andm y m other said she will buy 
candy.
 
So
 
m y sister and I thought, well, she'sgoing to spend the last penny
 
--
 
we thought 
you're outof  your m ind to buy the candy.
 
Som y m other bought the candy and we shared it.
 
And she said she wanted us totaste the sweetness of  life.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you each shared it.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
And we shared it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e have tim e f or a couple of  questions f rom  our audience.
 
Before we do,I just 
wanted to share som ething you wrote in your book, if  you don'tm ind. You wrote, " Our survi val 

depended 99% 
on random luck and1% on instinct and grit.
ï¬‚ 
W ithout the1% luck you were 
100% dead.
 
You've done an incredible job ina shorttime of helping us understandthat.
 
 
So let'sturn to our audience.
 
I'm  going to askyou if  would stay with usf or a couple 
of  qu e
stions becausewe're going to end theprogram  with Estelle sharing somef inal thoughts 
with us bef ore we do.
 
So please stay with us.
 
 
W e have time f or a couple of  questions.
 
W e have m icrophones in both aisles.
 
W e 
ask that you takea m icrophoneand thenm ake your questionsas brief  as you can.
 
I ' ll re p ea t  it  
just tobe sure that we hear it correctly up here.
 
And then Estelle will  respond to it.
 
 
Do we have anybody who would like to aska question?
 
W ehave one right down 
here.
 
I think Jocelyn iscom ing down w
ith the m icrophone.
 
 
T here we go.
 
>>
 
Ho w did you survi ve as you were traveling in them onths imm ediately after you were 
liberated?
 
How did you getf ood? 
 

 
11
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How did you survi ve in the months right af ter liberation?
 
You described how 
c o ld  it  wa
s.  
Ho w d id
 
yo u
 
make it? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Idon't know how we survived except
 
--
 
you know, people ask me 
som etimes was it hope that kept usalive andgoing.
 
I guess that there is in all of  us a current 
that wantsto live.
 
I know I wanted to live.
 
I f e l
t worthy of  living.
 
I think that this isa beautif ul 
drive in all of  us, the current and the lovef rom lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
 
 
Do we have another question?
 
I think we have one right here.
 
>>
 
Mrs .
 
Laughlin, I want to say thank you, thank youfor sharing your story.
 
Many of us want 
our children to know about the horrors of  theHolocaust.
 
W e are gratef ulfor thism useum .
 
W e 
are gratef ulfor people like you who share their story and rem indus the need of courageand 
love.
 
 
I guess what I want tosay is I've heard
 
--
 
I've seenthe word random  and 
random ness about the1%, your survi val, about that youdidn't get on the trainto go to the 

gunpowder f actory.
 
I'm  wondering if  you've considered that it wasn'trandom ;that God hada 
planfor you and people like you to survi ve to tell the story of the horrors.
 
I would askthat you 
comm ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Asking for your commentabout despite the com ment about randomness,the 
role of  God in your m ind in saving you.
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
Iam  not a religious person but I am a very spiritual person.
 
I  f e e l  very 
connected with all living things.
 
My parents were humanists they we re not religious
 b
u t  ve ry,  
ver y connected with all life.
 
I know thatm any people who held on toreligion, religion 
represents the nobility, the goodness inus.
 
Idon't know how to def ine thefact that we survi ved 
but that it was really random  luck, like when you scatter something on the ground and youpick 

it up something will happen to stay there.
 
Idon'tf eel that I was m ore deserving to survi ve than 
others were.
 
Idon't think that there'sany justif icationfor killing people.
 
Life is
 sa cred .  
It's noble.
 
I don't feel
 
--
 
I cannot explain wh y except thatI know that it's wrong; that we are all one and 
what any oneof  us does affectseveryone el
se . 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you, Estelle.
 
 
I thinkthat we're out of timefor questions.
 
I'm going to turn back to Estelle in a 
m om en t .
 
Bef ore Ido,I'd like to thank you allfor being with us.
 
I rem ind you that we'll havea 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program  each W ednesd

W e hope that 
you wi ll com e back.
 
But if not, them useum 'swebsite wi ll have inform ation about the
 
F i rs t  
Person

It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on

F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
hasthe last word.
 
S o  I ' ll

Bef ore I do, I just want to let you know that when Estelle is done, our 
photographer, Joel, will com e up on the stage and he's going to take a photograph of Estelle 

with you as thebackground.
 
So we ask that you stay with us sothatwe can take that picture of  
E s t e lle .
 
 
I also would like to let you know, rem ind you, that when Estelle is done, she is going 
to go up to the doors at the top of the stairs where she will be available to sign cop

book, "T ranscending D

Ithasa lot that we weren't able to get to today, I can tell you 
th a t.
 
 
Estelle? 
 
>> Estelle Laughlin:
 
T hank you all so very m uch f or being here.
 
Seldom are people willing to 
listen or to tell the stories because they generate suchpain yet we have to be rem indedf rom  

 
12
 
tim e to tim eof  the consequencestous and to hum anity when we accomm odate ourselves to 
tie tyrants, how it corrupts the conscience of a nation, what itdoes to love and what it does to 

tru st.
 

 
As long as there arepeople who say that
 
the Holocaust didnot happen, in som e 
wa ys Majdanek andAuschwitz are still with us.
 
I am  so gratef ulfor this wonderf ulm useum 
because them useum proves thathistory always rem embers and we must listen
 i
f  c ivili za t io n  is  
to progress.
 
 
T hank youagain somuchfor being here.
