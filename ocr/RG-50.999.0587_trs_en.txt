T hisnext picture we see Al's parents, Sim chaand guess sell, at theocc
asion of  their 
wedding in 1932 in the Dutch city of T he Hague. Al had two older sisters, Ava and Leana. 

W ithbaby Al proppedup between them for support. T hism ap hasa broader context. The 

circle is the Netherlands and thesearrows indicate in May 1940thepath of the Germ an Arm y.  

Invading the Netherlands and this is before Al was born.  Imm ediately lif e became very diff icult 

for Jews li ving in Holland andaf ter the invasion the Munzers rem ained in their home and 

endured repressive m easures,as we shall see.  In 1942 Al's sisterswent into hiding with a 

f riend of the neighborand Al, baby Al, was put into hiding with the ex
-
husbandof  a neighbor, a 
gentleman that we see here, in Indonesian imm igrant namedT ole Madna.  As we wi ll soon 

hear in great detail, Al spent the restof  the war in hiding inTole Madna'shom e wherehewas 

caredfor by theIndonesiannanny, Mim a Saina. And in this photograph taken with Al as the 

baby T toddler inTole Madna'sarm s, Mim aSaina is. He went to learned English, went t
o 
m edical school wherehe trainedas a pulm onologist.  He's quitem odestbut we becam e the 

president of the Am erican Lung Association. He remains deeply involved in anti

sm oking 
eff orts, internationally workin g with theW orld HealthOrganization. And is deeply invol ved 

here at that tim e museum .  W e are very f ortunate that Al gives ver y,  ver y generously of his

Alf red Munzer.
 
(Applause)
 
  

W elcom e, Al. Thank you very m uchfor joining us.  Can youhearus okay?  Can you 
hear m e?
 
Al Munzer:  Can youhear me.
 
Edna Friedberg:  More im portant, can you hear Al? T hank youfor being ourf irst person 
guest today.
 
Al Munzer:  Sure.
 
Edna Friedberg:  Let'sbegin with talk ago little bitabout your parents. Tell usabout 
who they were in their lives before the second world war.
 
Al Munzer:  Sure. W ell, m y parents were born in easternEurope ina part of the world 
thatprior tothef irst world war was part of  theAustro
-
Hungarianempire.  Af ter thef irst worl d 
war, their little hom etowns became part of Poland. My m other was born ina small town call
ed 
Rym anow, andm y father in a neighboring town called Kanzcuga.  And, you know, there were 

ver y f ew opportunities in those towns.  Therewas also increasing anti
-
s e m it is m  so  s om et ime  
in the 1920s whenthey were about 18 years old,m y parents lef ttheir home. T hey actually 

followed in thef ootsteps of  som e
 
--
 
some other people who had left the town.  One person I 
like tom entionf rom my mother's hom etown, which peoplehave this
 
--
 
this idea that these little 
towns were ver y backward, especially if  anyonehas seen them ovie " Fiddler on the Roof."  In 

actualfact, one of the people who cam ef rom m y m other's hometown was a manby the nam e 

of  Isador Rabi who was awarded the Nobel Pri ze in physics in 1946for the discovery of  

electrom agnetism .  Here you have it som eone com ingf rom one of these little towns.  My 

3 
 
parents were not in that same category butmy f ather lef thom e directly to go to Holland to start 
a men's clothing business andm y m other went to Berlin where she joined older siblings and 

worked in their business actually until she f inally joined m y father, asyou've m entioned, at the 

endof 1932 in Holland where they were m arried. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  Andyou m entionthat yourfatherhad started a men's clothing 
business. T here's still actually a sign there,
 
isn't there?
 
Al Munzer:  Yes, even, you know, just afew years ago, I was in Holland, went back to 
ourf orm er home andthen right next to our hom e was m y father's business. And loand 

behold, this huge sign of it says Siegf ried Munzer tailor anda little
 
bit  of  a wh it e  lie ,  t a ilo rf ro m  
Vienna, you know, sort of  boasting.  That big sign is still there to m y great surprise. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  So your parentsm adetheir wa y to Holland, bothfor economic 
opportunity but as you m entionedalso to escapeanti
-
s em
itism, an ti
-
Jewish f eeling. W hatdo 
you know f rom  your motherabout what lif e was like in Hollandfor them  in the 1930s?
 
Al Munzer: W ell, when m y parents arrived inHolland,they joined afairly well think 
we l l
-
to
-
do Jewish comm unity that hadbeenestablished in Hollandfor hundredsof  years,was 
totally integrated into Dutch society.  They wer e in thearts, they were  in the governm ent and 

really, you know, a very well established Jewi sh com munity that in som e ways went all thewa y 

back to the expulsion of  Jews in 1492f rom  Spain.  So they had been there, asI said,f ora very 

long tim e.  My parents m adem any, m anyf riends.  Most of them notJewish and really, you 

know, their business thrived and they really had really good lives in Holland.
 
Edna Friedberg:  And theirf am ily expanded shortly thereafter.
 
Al Munzer:  Yes asm y father's businessf lourished som y parentsfelt conf ident they 
ought to startafam ily.  And in July 1936m y m other gave birth to her f irst child andthat was 

m y sister Eva.  Interestingl y enough,Eva was  born just about the sam e tim e that the infamous 

Berlin Olym pics were held which Adolf Hitler tried to turn intoan instrum entof  Nazi 

propaganda.  So hereyou have it, you know,thebeginning of the rise of the Nazis really ju st a 

f e w h
undred m iles away actually alm ost pretty m uch
 
--
 
almost them iddle of  the Nazi era. And 
in Holland, you know,people celebrating a very happy occasion, the birth of a young daughter.
 
Edna Friedberg:  Andwhen was their second daughter born?
 
A l  Mu n ze r:  My
 
sister Leana was born in 1938.  She was born Novem ber12, 1938.  And 
that, too, is a very im portanthistorical date because she was born just three days af ter what is 

called Kristallnachtor the nightof broken glass when thef ullfury of anti
-
s em it is m  wa
s 
unleashed in Germ any and in Austria. And it's when hundreds of  synagogues were destroyed 

andthousands of Jewish businesses were plundered in Germ any and the German Reich. So 

here you have the contrast again of a very happy occasion, the birth of  their
 
second daughter, 
while the Nazi era, you know, is progressing, just afew hundredm iles away.
 
Edna Friedberg:  And then less thana year later onSeptem ber 1,1939, Germany 
invades Poland startingW orldW ar II. By the spring of  1940, the war has come literally to your 

parents' doorstep with the German invasion. T ell us if  you can whatthatmeantf or yourf am ily 

andotherf am ilies live Jews li vin g in Holland.
 
Al Munzer:  That represented a very, ver y m ajor change in their lives .  It actually began 
duri
ng thenight of May 9
 
o r  10
 
--
 
sorry.  1940when m y parents hadbeen asked to host a 
m em ber of  the Dutch resistance movem ent. A man who hada briefcase with him that 

supposedly containedplans to preemptively destroy themajor railroad center in the city 
of  

Utrecht with theexpectationof  slowing that railroad centerm ight slow down any in vasion 

com ingf rom  Germ any.  But thef ollowing m orning m y parents and their guests listened to the 

4 
 
radio and they heard that theport city of  Rotterdam , the largestport in Europe, had been 
bombed anddestroyed by Nazi in vaders.  And justaf ew m inutes later QueenW ilhelm inaof  

the Netherlands cameon the radio andannounced that Hollandhad surrendered.  And she 

told people to do their job or their duty everyw here whereve
r they happened to f ind 

them selves.  And it was actually m y parents'guest who was thef irst one to speak up, and in 

Dutch he said, (speaking non
-
English phrase).  Thank God it's over.  Asfar as he was 
concerned, he would
 
--
 
he had done what he could by b
eing am ember of the Dutch resistance 
m ovement.  Hehadtried to slow down any invasion.  And he now would just have to try to 

accommodate to living under anoccupation. 
 
Butm y parents, thinking of their two little children, and knowing what had happened 
t o 
their relatives in Germany andBerlin, their relatives rem aining in Poland, knew that things 

were going to get ver y hard andthat they wer e going to be very m uch alone.  And indeed 

alm ost imm ediately all of  the restrictions on Jewish lif e thathad been put inplaceover years in 

Germ any and in Austria were put in place inHolland over justthe matter of days.  Sooneof  

thef irstthings that happened was that the ritual slaughterof  animals was bannedfor kosher 

m eat. And you know som e people m ighthave
 
thought well, so
-
called hum anem easure.  But 
then Jews hadto register as Jews.  Jewish men hadto takea new m iddle name, Israel.  

Jewish wom ena new m iddle nam e Sara.  And then there were regulations that really m ade 

absolutely no sense whatsoever, even
 
if  youassumedthe others did, and that'sthat the Jews 
were prohibitedf rom going into public parks or f rom  using public transportation. And, you 

know, when you have a regulation like that, it m akes really ver y, ver y little sense. People tend 

to disobey it.  Som y m other toldm e that, youknow, she def ied the ordinance and she would 

takem y little sister Leana inthe baby carriage to thepark. And one day a Germ an wom an 

approached thebaby carriage andm y m other's heartalmost stopped because she knew 
she 

wasn't supposedto be there. And then the Germ an wom an lookedatm y sister in the baby 

carriage and she saw blond curls blue eyes and she turned tom y motherand smiled and said 

you can tell this is good Germ an Aryan blood.  My m other thanked the wom an of course and 

then she lef tthe park and never went back there again.T his was just one of many episodes 

that showed, you know, the terrible conditions under which Jews li ve d in Holland during those 

even early years of  the occupation. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  There were all of  these measures to identif y and track Jews, to 
m arginalize them  through law in society.  By March 1941 there wasa big econom ic im pact 

when Jewish property was quote, unquote,Aryani zed.  Can youtellour audience what that 

m eant?
 
Al Munzer: W ell, it meant that m yf ather's business,for exam ple, had to be registered 
and off icially becam e part of  German ownership of  the German governm ent.  She had to
 
--
 
m y 
parents, you know, had to surrender their jewelry, f or example. And it really m eant 

im poverishing the Dutch Jewish comm unity.  Andfortunately they were able to hide som eof  

their possessions.  Again, this was a major step towards isolating the Jews, towards restricting 

their businessactivities, and making life in generalm iserable.  You
 
kn o w,  s o m e of t h e f am i l y 
m em bers, there was one fam ily m em ber essentially who escapedf rom  Germany to join our 

fam ily, it was m y f ather's brother, m y uncle and he had hoped by leaving Germ any and 

crossing the border into Holland that he would be safe.  And, you know, he joined ourf am ily 

and initially indeed, you know, this was before the invasion, indeed, you know, they had afairly 

normal life together.  But after the invasionof course itbecam e really m iserable. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  And the strangleholdontheJews li vin g in Hollandbecame worse and 

5 
 
worse.  By August 1941 Jewish children were bannedf rom  public schools.  Your parentshad 
already m adea different decision with regard to your sister Eva andschool.  Can you tell us a 

little bit about that?
 
A
l Munzer: W ell,m y two sisters were enrolled in a Catholic schoolas a way of  hiding 
their Jewish identity.  And, you know, that
 
--
 
eventually that led to where they were hidden 
actually.  But this was also justaboutthetime when m y motherf ound out tha
t she wa s 

pregnantagain and itwas an unplannedpregnancy.  And she consultedher obstetrician,and 

theobstetrician told my m other in no uncertain term s that she should have an abortion.  He 

told her that it would be imm oral to bring another Jewish lif e into theworld.  Andm y m other 

wasn't particularly religious, eventhough shecam ef rom  a very traditional Jewish background, 

but, you know, they were sort of rebelling against that,m y parents. But at thattim e m y mother 

turned to the Bible for advice an
d she read the story of  a woman called Hannah. A wom an 

who was desperate toconceive and would go through to the tem pleever y year and pray that 

shem ight have a child.  And it was in reading of  Hannah's agonizing desire to have a child that 

m y m other decided she could not possibly have an abortion.  Her obstetricianf ired heras a 

patient and so ninem onths later I was born wi th the helpof  a nurse at home. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  That's Novem ber 23,1941.
 
Al Munzer:  That was Novem ber 23, 1941. Really 18 m onths into the Nazi occupation.  
And, you know, that was brought about another dilem ma in Jewish lif ebecausetraditionally 

Jewish baby boys, wh en they're eight days old, are circum sized.  It's really a m ajorm ilestone 

in a Jewish life, thef irst milestone.  Andm y parents'f riends said, you know, don't have him 

circum sized because it will identif y him  as being Jewish.  And this tim etheanswer tom y 

parents' dilem ma came in theform of a worri ed look on thef ace ofa pediatrician who had just 

exam ined me andm y fatherasked the pediatrician, is in anything wr ong with the baby?  And 

thepediatrician sm iledand said no. He said, it's nothing serious.  It's just that your littleboy 

needs am inor operation that we call a circumcision.  And so eightdays later ou
r f amily 

gathered in our living r oom and observed this f irstm ilestone in a Jewish lif e, probably the last 

such cerem ony held in the city I was born inT he Hague.  And thatwas ver y special about that, 

obviously I said very i m portant m ilestone, so m y parents had pictures taken. And what we 

have actually are two very sm all photographs, aboutone by oneanda half inch in size taken 

at that ceremony.  So I canbarely seem y two  sisters, m y uncle, theone who joinedusf rom  

Germ any, and som eother people in thatpicture.  I'm  in the second picture.  And whatm ade 

these pictures very sp ecial is thatm y m other was to keep them hiddenonher body through 

her subsequent stay in 12 concentration camps.  And shedeveloped thisfeeling, this 

superstition that if  she ever lost those photographs it would mean that I had been killed.  

Fortunately m y m other survi ved, thephotos survi ved, andI survived  and thosephotos now are 

sof ragile and they're so valuable that I did not want to keep them  inthehouse and they are 

no
w part of the collection of thism useum . But it's, you know, justone of  those little stories that 

com es out of an eventlike that.  But as I said, the last such celebration in Holland.
 
Edna Friedberg:  Thank you for entrusting uswith those, you know, pr
ecious 
photographs. It's really our sacred duty to caref or them.  AndI'm  struck when you m ention the 

choices your parentshad to make, the leap of faithtobring another Jewish lif e into the world at 

this very perilous m oment. T he historical coincidences that coincidedm ore or less with your 

sisters' births, that when we talk about history andpartof  what's so am azing in these 

conversations is to realize that people are still leading their lives.  It's easy to look athistory as 

a series of datesand decisions by people in offices but it happens to real people with real 

6 
 
fam iliesand real considerations on adiff erent trajectory.
 
So they hadthis new baby, they have two young children, they don'thave a reliable way 
to m ake a living. W hat happened over 
thenext year until September 42?
 
Al Munzer: W ell, in just aboutm id1942,Septem ber
 
--
 
August,Septem ber 1942, I 
guess when I was about six, seven m onths old or so, and there'sa beautiful photograph. Oh, 
you saw the photograph earlier of me with m y two
 
sisters taken probably precisely at that tim e.  
T hat's when Jewish m en were beginning to get notices to reportfor so
-
called labor duty.  And it 
m eant going to a concentration cam p A labor camp, somewhere inHolland.  But also, knowin g 

full well that that
 
m ightbe som ething tem porary and that they m ightwell be sent on, you know, 
m uchf urther east to concentration camps located in Poland.  And so this was really when 

m any Jewish fam iliesm ade thedecision totry to f ind a place to hide.  Now, somefam ilies
,  lik e  
famousfam ily Anne Frank, went intohiding as onef am ily unit. T hefamous attic thatthe Anne 

Frank
 
--
 
Anne Frank'sfam ily occupied in Am sterdam .  My parents madea different decision.  
T hey decided thatas a form of  insurance to make sure that even if all otherm em bers of the 

fam ily were taken by the Nazis, at least som e
 
--
 
the othersm ight have a chance to survive, 
that we would split up.  So thef irstones to be placed were m y two si sters.  A very
 
--
 
a  ve r y 
devout Catholic wom an had a dream  in which she saw the virgin telling her to take Jewish 

children into hiding.  She told that story to her priest. Thepriest told the story to m y parents' 

neighbor,and som y two sisters were entrusted to this woman's care.
 
My f ather comm ittedor tried to show
 
--
 
claim ed to comm itanactof suicide or
 
--
 
and that 
gained him  adm ission to apsychiatric hospital, pretended is the word I was lookingf or, 

pretended to com m it an actof  suicideandthat gained him  adm ission toa psychiatric hospital 

where he went into hiding.  And as we saidearlier, Jewish boys were  m ore diff icult toplacebut 

eventually m y m other's neighbor,a wom an by thenam eof Annie Madna agreed to takem e in, 

at least tem porarily.  And at thatpoint m y mother joinedm y f ather inthat same psychia
t ri c  

hospital, in her case pretending tobea nurse.  And that's when sheclosed thedooronour 

homefor the very, ver y last time,af terhaving foundm y f ather, having gone intohiding, having 

found a ref ugefor m y two sisters, a ref ugefor m e, and shef i
nally then closed the door on our 
homefor the very last tim e and joined m yf ather. 
 
Annie Madna, the woman I had been lef t with, had had som e bad run
-
ins with the Nazis.  
And so she was scared that they would f ind that she was hiding a Jewish baby.  So sh
e  initia lly 

passed me on to a sister and then itturned out that the sister had aneighbor who was a 

m em ber of  the DutchNazi party.  And so she got scared. She was af raid that he m ighthear 

the little baby crying, so she passedm e back to Annie.  And the
n f inally Annie decided to pass 
m eon to her ex
-
husband. She was divorced andhad beenmarriedto am an born in 
Indonesia.  And that's how I endedup with an Indonesianfam ily f or the rest of the war years.
 
Edna Friedberg:  AndAl, if Im ay interrupt, peo
p le le s s f am ilia r wit h  Du t c h h is t o ry,  
Indonesiahad been acolony of  the Netherlands so there was a sizable Indonesian imm igrant 

colony living in the Netherlands.
 
Al Munzer:  Indonesiawas a Dutch colony and many Indonesians in theearly 1900 had 
com e to Holland, including m y new fosterf ather, them an I called Papafor the rest of his life.  

He came to Holland wi th hism other. They said in the early 1900sand eventually becam ea 

m anager of anIndonesian restaurant.  Anda wom an, there was a wom an who worked there 

who was also Indonesian but ona muchpoorer background.  Hernam eI was Mima Saina. 

And she was com pletely il literate, uneducated, didnot speak the Dutch language,only the 

Indonesian language.  But she was a very go od wom an. She worked in the
 
restaurant, like 

7 
 
m any other imm igrants, doingm enial work.  But Papa Madna realized she was ver y good and 
ver y kind, so he hired her totake careof  thethree Madna children. And whenI joined the 

household, she is theone who then assumed the roleof  being m y nanny or really m y m other.  

Andeven though thiswom an was completely it literate, uneducated, Muslim, she had aheart 

of  gold and she wouldwalk miles ever y day, you know, just to get milk f orme.  Since I was in 

thehom e completely illegally, there were no ration couponsform e.Ration coupons whichyou 

neededto getany kind of m ilk or bread, whatever.  And so she would have to walk m iles just 

to getm ilk.  Inf act, you know, justaf ew years ago when I was in Hollanda wom an stopped 

m e and said,
 
you know, you used to drinkm y m ilk.  And I asked herwhat do youm ean? And 
she said, well, she said, during the war years all children in schoolwere gi ven a sm all bottle of  

m ilk andm y m other told me to save half of the little bottlef or thebaby next door. And you 

were the baby next door.  And this is how, you know, you have a little girl, perhapseight or 

nine years old, already participating in saving a hum an lif e.  I'm  told I slepton Mima's bedand 

she kepta knife under her pillow vo w to go kill  any Nazi who m ight try to come and getm e. 

But, you know, whatever m em ories that Ihave of that time,are really actually ver y happy ones.  

I remember Papa Madna playing the piano. I rem em ber that therewas a little dog in the 

f a m ily.   A c t ua lly f o r lit t l
e  
--
 
you know, little Jewish children placed in hiding were gi ven a new 
name,and I was given  thenam eBobbie. And tothis stay when I talk tom y fosterfam ily, the 

fam ily thatI was hidden with, I always have to use that name Bobbie.  Andfor many, many 

years I thought I was given the name Bobbieaf ter the little dog thatthey had.
 
( Laughter ) 
 
T he reasonfor that was theneighborsheardBobbie being killed
 
--
 
being called, they 
would think well, they're just calling the littledog. W ell,I told this story just about two years  

ago toone of m y foster sisters, Debbie Madna who's 87 years old,and I told her the story.  

And she said you're absolutely wrong.  T he little dog's nam e was teddy, not Bobbie. 
 
(Laughter)
 
So there
 
--
 
there went that whole theory. 
 
Andthe reason I was called Bobbie was 
probably af ter the third of  the Madna childrenwho was a little boy by thenam eof  Robbie, 

Robbie Madna.  Andthose two nam es alsoare very close, sam e theory.  Neighbors hearing 

Bobbie being called,they'd think well, they're just calling Robbie, and another way of  course of  

m aking surethat people did not know that there was a strange Jewish baby in the household.  

I wasn't allowed out ofthe house at all.
 
Edna Friedberg:  For how long?
 

Al Munzer:  For about three years. T he only view that I hadof  theoutside world was 
through a mail slot. That was m y total view of theoutside world. T hat's how I grew up.  And I 

was allo wed a littlebit in the backyard fortunately.  T here were also two neighbor children who 

were 
allowed to come in and play with m e.  And the reason they wer e considered safe was 
thatthey were Germ an but their parents were Germ an comm unists and so they were ver y 

staunchly anti
-
nazi, anti
-
f ascist,and sothey were entirely trusted to com e in to the house and 
play with m e. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  Just to im agine any of us who live with or have lived with a toddler, 
just being caught up in a room for an hour canf eel like years, threeyears that you're inside, 

and jokes asideabout it, how risky and how tenuous your situation was.  The networks of  trust 

that were required. Peoplem ust have known in the neighborhood also that there'sa little white 

boy living with this Indonesianf am ily, m ore
 
--
 
m ore than just one ortwo people knew.
 
Al Munzer:  Yes.  Many years later when I cam eback to Hollandand went into an 

8 
 
Indonesian grocery store with Papa Madna, a m an pointed to me and saidBobbie. He 
im mediately, you know, seeing the combination of an Indonesian man and someone 

Caucasian, he imm ediately knew I was the
 
little boy he had heard about many, many years 
earlier.  So yes, you know, som epeople in the Indonesian com munity certainly were aware  of  

m y presence and keptthat secret. 
 
T here were tim es, though, when I'm toldthe house was being searched and whatI 
rem em ber about it is just having to go into a little cellar and someone closing thedooronthe 

cellar was really m ore like a closet. And I would play there with theChristmas
 
decorations of  
thefam ily. T hat's the m em ory thatI have.  Idon't remember anything, that the reason was I 

was there because the house was being searched.  But that was one of those occasionsand 

oneof  those memories that I have.  Papa Madnatoldm e that he had told the Germ ans when 

they searched thehouse and questioned thepresence of a Caucasian child, he told them that I 

was the illegitim ate child of his ex
-
wif eand that she now had anew boyf riend who didnotwant 
m e around, and that's how he expla
ined the presence of this little white littleboy in a 

household of peopleof threeother children, older children who looked very, ver y diff erent. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  If indit ver y hard to im aginethe courage andthe m indset of  your 
parents to give up their three young children to the careof strangers.  Did they have any news 

of  you or your sisters?  Any contact with you?
 
Al Munzer:  The last
 
--
 
they had very l ittle contact with m eactually, as far asI know.  
T hey saw m y sisters one last time on Christmas
 
day 1942. T hat's when m y two sisters wer e 
brought to the psychiatric hospitalfor justa very brief  moment. T hefam ily was reunited,at 

least thatpartof  the fam ily.  But then, justaweek later, on New Ye ar's day, 1943,the 

psychiatric hospital where m y parentshad been hidden was emptied of all patients and staff  

andthey were all deported and sentto concentration cam ps.  My parentsfirst went to a 

concentration cam p in Holland calledW esterbork which was a transient camp.  From  there 

they went to another concentration cam p, still located in Holland, called Vught where theywere 

assigned to do slave laborfor thePhilips Electronicsf actory.  Andmy m other toldm eone 

day
 
--
 
ever y m orning there would be a line
-
up of all the prisoners and she said one 
d a y a  ve r y 
high Nazi off icial cam e to visit theprisoners and addressthe prisoners and that was a manby 

thenam eof  Himm ler,Heim lich Himm ler, Hitler's second in comm and.  He said if  you keep 

workin g f or the success of  Germ any, of  the Germ an Reich,nothingbad will ever happen to 

you.  And m y mother told me that way off in the distance in Hollandshe could see the spire of  

a small Dutch church,and she said it wouldbe so wonderful if  peace were to break out at that 

m om ent, if  she could just runtothat c
hurch, fall on her knees, and thank God f or having 
survi ved.  She didn't care whether it was a church,am osque,or asynagogue, just aplace to 

thank God.  Butof  course that wasn't tohappen. And on the prom ise that Himmlerm ade to 

the inm ates, to the p
risoners, wasn't kept, and justaf ew m onths later that prison
 
--
 
that cam p 
was em ptied of all prisoners andthey were all senton to Poland toAuschwitz.  And that's 

where m y parents were separated.  Myf ather rem ained in Auschwit z f or about six m onths, a
n d 

m y m other was senton toanother cam p called Reichenbach where she continued todo 

electronics work for the Telefunken com pany.  And all the while, ofcourse, they thought that 

their children were safe.  T hat was one bitof satisf action,one thing that I really think kept them 

alive at the time, was this idea that, you know, they had children to com e home to eventually.
 
Sadly, sadly thehusband of the wif e, the wom an who had taken inm y children
 
--
 
Edna Friedberg:  Your sisters.
 
Al Munzer: W ho hadtaken, sorry, m y sisters, denounced his wif eas hiding two Jewish 

9 
 
children, so the Nazis took his wif e.  She wasim prisoned,buteventually f reed.  Butm y two 
sisters were im m ediately sent to Auschwitz and killed. And they wer e only six and eight years 

old.  T
hey were killed February 11,1944. And that was something, of  course, that my parents 
did not know about atthe timeand thatm y mother was to learnm uch,m uch later. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  They knew nothing of whatwas going on with you, and you were 
obviousl
y too young toknow, but you say you have m em oriesf rom  the winter of  1944 to '45as 
especially bitter.
 
Al Munzer:  Yes, there was absolutely nofood lef t in Holland. T he only thing that was 
there to eat really was ground up tulip bulbswhich Holland had m any of .  And y'all know 

famous Dutch tulips. People would grind upthe tulip bulbs and sort of  createam ush or a 

pudding outof  that, and that's what sustained people. And what I rem em ber is that one 

evening I saw the table set with plates and I thought we were going to be f ed, I was going to be 

fed. So I sat down atm y chair at thetable. Andfell asleep. My headfalling into the plate, and 

that'show thefam ily f oundm e thef ollowing m orning. I rem em ber the very intense hunger of  

that very last winter in Holland.
 
Edna Friedberg: W hat happenedto your parentsfor the duration of the war?
 
Al Munzer: W ell,m y m other,as I said, shewas in thisf actory call edT elefunken where 
she also assembled
 
--
 
where she assembledradio tubes.  She had learned that was an 
essential thingf orthe war eff ort.  Andm y m other took some satisfaction at that tim e in working 

alongside Germ an soldiers who had servedon theeasternf ront, who had been repatriated 

f rom  Russia.  Andthey were m inus an arm  ora leg. T hey had beenseverely injured, were no 

longer f itf orduty.  And so they were sent to work alongside in thisfactory.  And they had 

becom e so anti
-
Hitler that they dideverything possible to sabotage the workings of thef actory 
so .  
T hat encouragedm y m other to startherown little acts of def iance.  And one of the 
things that she did was she would spend a whole day assembling one radio tube and then 

when the siren was sounded at the endof  the day to indicate the end of work, she would 

disassem ble the radio tube, p
ut all thepartsback in the drawer and then start theprocessall 
over again thefollowing day.  An act of def iance that really, I think, kepther going.
 
Another act of def iance was observing Jewis h holidays or trying to.  Andone of them is 
the holiday o
f  Chanukah.  Chanukah is whencandles andf estival oflights.  And som y m other 
toldm e the women would go to the inf irmary andtell the nurse thatthey were having their 

m enstrual periodand needed a wad of  cotton.  And they would thensave a little bit o
f  o il f rom  
them achinery they we re working on, fashionwicks out of  the cotton, and put those intoa 

potato, which was theonly kind of food thatthey had.  And then in the evening light that little 

wick.  And that's how they continuedtoobserve the holiday of  Chanukah.  Something that 

again anactof  def iance that Ithink kept heralive.  M y m other eventually witnessed the 

bombing by theallies ofthatf actory, as she said a Hebrew prayer of thanks to God when she 

saw thef actory going up in f lames. Thanking Godf orhaving survi ved to see thatparticular 

day.  But that wasn't the end of her ordeal.  Because m y mother then was putona whole 

series of deathm archers as the Soviet Arm y approached all of the prisoners were m arched 

further and f urther back we
st until m y motherf inally cam e intoa camp atthe Danish border 

where she was lib rated tothe intervention ofa man called Bernadotte who was thehead of  

the Swedish Red Cross.  Andm y m other then was repatriated, sent to sweeten to recuperate. 

My f ather, on the other hand,as I said rem ained inAuschwitz. W assenton to a horrible cam p 

called Mauthausen, then threem ore cam ps in Austria, Gusen, Steyr, andf inally a beautiful 

10
 
 
placehigh up in the Austrian Alps wherehedid horrible work assembling V2
 
ro
ckets f or the 
Germ an Arm y in abandoned salt m ines. And terrible, terrible work, debilitating work.  Buthe 
did see liberation by the AmericanArm y.  But he was so weakenedthathepassed away two 

m onths later andhe'sactually buried in that concentration
 
cam p.  Ihave visited his grave there 
andthe only tim e that I really shed tearsf ormy f am ily, like really understood the lossof  a 

father is when I stood at hisbrave and brokedown in tears
 
Edna Friedberg:  Your m other,having m anaged to survive, returnedto the Netherlands, 
hoping to reunite with her children.  How didshe learn what hadhappenedtoher two little 

girls ?
 
Al Munzer: W ell Debbie Madna toldm e thatm y m other cam e toher house which was 
really her m other's house, the wom an I was lef t with
 
initially, and she was the one to tell her 
thatm y sisters were no longer there.W ithout any real details. I don't know exactly what m y 

m otherfound out whathappened tom y sisters.  But then shetookme
 
--
 
she tookm y m other 
over to the house where I now was, and that's the very clear m emory that I have.  I remember 

being asleep inone of theback room s of thehouse andm y sister Debbie coming to wakem e 

up and carry m e into the living room  where the wholef am ily was sitting in a circle. AndI was 

c ra n
ky and crying, so they did what you typically do with a cryin g child.  They passedm ef rom  
lap to lap.  And what I rem ember there was one lapI wouldn't sit in, a wom an I kept pushing 

away.  And that was my o wn m other. Because she was, you know, com plete 
stra n ge r to me .  I 

already had am otherand that was Mim a Saina. And m y mother knew that it would be very 

diff icult to separate me f rom  Mim a, so she decided that Mim aoughtto continue to careform e 

while she and m y mother went out lookingf orwork.  But
 
that only lastedaf ew m onths 
because inOctober 1945 sadly Mim a had a cerebral hemorrhage and passedaway.  And I 

have ver y, ver y f ew m em ories actually of  Mim aSaina.  I remember visiting her grave and 

another m em ory that I have that I recently or a f ew 
years ago for the ver y first time was able to 
share with studentsf rom  Indonesia visiting the United Statesto learn about what religious 

pluralism  is about. And I told them  the story of m y f am ily, showed them photographs of me 

with Mim a andthen atthe very end, I said, you know, I have almostnom em oriesof  Mima 

except that she usedto sing a lullaby tome. And it was called " Nina Bobo" and this whole 

group of  students started singing it in unison. An amazing m om ent. It brought tears to m y 

eyes.  And af ter that these young wom en, Muslim  wom en, young Muslim  wom en wearing 

traditional head scarves, came up tom e,hugged m e, kissed me, and said, you know, we are 

fam ily.  And incredibly, you know, incredibly powerf ulm om ent that Iwi ll never f orget. And it
's  
onem omentthat really gives m ea littlebit ofhope inm y story. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  Youshould know that Al continues to work with gr oupsf rom 
Indonesia, with survi vors from  the genocide in Cam bodia.  He really understands andputs 

your heart into knowing what your stories can do tobuildbridges. W ehave justanother 

m inute ortwo bef ore we opento questions. Ido want you to tell us about an incident at that 

tim em ovies thathappened, your mother cam eback to the Netherlands, she's lost her 

husband, 
two of  her three children, her extendedfam ily, but shehasto try to
 
--
 
Al Munzer:  Sure.
 
Edna Friedberg:  
--
 
continue with lif e.
 
Al Munzer:  Sure.  And so m y mother, you know, tried
 
--
 
she really wanted me to get 
usedtobeing alone with her. Rather thanbeing entirely dependenton Mima.  Som y m other 

gave Mim a a ticket togo see a movie.  AndMim a lef t the houseand then she came backaf ew 

m inutes later. W agged her finger atm y m other, don'thit him . That's how protective Mim a was 

11
 
 
onm e that she didn't even trust m y own m other to caref orm e.  A wom an who was really 
totally devotedtom e.  In f act, som e people say that, you know, shepassed away not justof a 

cerebral hemorrhage but because of abroken heart, she was so af raid shem ight lose the littl
e 
baby that she had cared for. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  AndAl, you were able to get the Madnafam ily and Mim a recognized 
as righteousamong the nationsfor the incredible risk they took to save your lif e.
 
Al Munzer:  Yes, they were recogni zed by Yad Vashem , them em orial to the Holocaust 
in Jerusalem  where their names are inscribed as righteous am ong the nations, people who 

risked their lives to save Jewish children andadults.  People, you know
 
--
 
in this whole seaof  
evil, there were af ew good people like themwho really r isked their lives to continueto dowhat 

is right.  And so Iam so glad that they were r ecognized over there.If that 30 hadbeen ten 

tim esor 100 tim esasm any people like them perhaps the Holocaust m ight nothave happened.  

And I think, you know, their lesson is really im portant one. And that's wh y I continue to share 

the story with Papa Madna's grandchildren, great grandchildren, andnow with anybody coming 

to visit them useum  and studentsf rom  all over the country, all over the world, because I want 

them  to learn that it ispossibleto stand upf or what is right, even wh en you're surroundedby 

e vil.
 
Edna Friedberg:  I'd like toopen itupto questionsf rom  theaudience. We have two 
ushers with m icrophones.  If you have a question,please raise yourhand and we'll pass the 

m icrophone to you. T here's one down here in f rontand one on theback aisleas well.  Andif  I 

couldask if  you'd keep your questions brief, that would be great.  Thank you. 
 
Audience Mem ber:  Should I go ahead?
 
Edna Friedberg:  Sure.  If you've got the m icf irst.
 
Audience Mem ber: T hank you very m uch. That was awesome.  My questionto you is, 
am idst everything that was going on in Europe and learning something I never knew before, 

thatIndonesian community that was there,how m uchfear did they have of  the Nazis being 

Indonesian, Muslim, and in a place thattheywere a m inority? 
 
Al Munzer:  It's a very good question, andI really don't have a very good answer to it. 
In actualfact, whatI've been able to learn is that theIndonesian com munity in Holland was not 

singled out like the Jews.  Or like Af rican people
 
--
 
people of Af rican dissentm ight have been.  
And why that is, I don't really know. W hetherthey were not groupedwith the so
-
called inf erior 
races m ight be on
e reason. But many Indonesians living in Hollandwere part of  the resistance 

m ovement.  Very active resistancem ovement, especially am ong Indonesian students. They 

were f ighting forf reedom for Indonesiaf rom  Holland,f rom being a colony, but they saidf
i rs t  
we have to deal with the Germ ans and then we'll deal with Holland. T hat was sort of their 

m o tto . 
 
Edna Friedberg:  If  I could justadd, oneof  the other things you notice if you look at Nazi 
racial policy is how inconsistent itof ten is. There will be exceptions and depending on the 

context also a lot was lef t to the discretionof an individual off icial indifferent locations.  And 

even in the way that anti
-
Jewish policy was enf orced varied greatly from  place to place. So it 
is consistent to be inconsistent is essentially how I would answer you r question.  Yes, sir.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Anumber of  us in thef ront coupleof  rows herearef rom Minnesota 
andabouta week agothey announcedthat they hadfound amember of  the Nazi SS living i n 

Minneapolis 
i n  S t.
 
Paul.  I think he's 98 yearsold.  Do you have any personalf eelings as to 
what shouldhappen when we discover, when we f ind som eone like that? 
 
Al Munzer:  This is a really tough question, you know.  Many, many years have passed.  

12
 
 
On the otherhand, it'snever too latefor justice tooccur. And I think it is im portant to 
prosecute whatever rem aining Nazis thereare.  Obviously, you know, it's
 
--
 
there are f ewer 
andfewer of  them around.  But if  we allow their crim es to go unanswered, we are really 

becom ing com plicit in these crim es. And these are crimes that really I think needtobe 

prosecutedto the very end.  I think it'spartof thehum an conscience.
 
Edna Friedberg:  I'd like toadd, if  I m ight,too, a coupleof other reasonsfor trials.  It's 
onething to thinkabout a very elderly m an near theend of his lif ebut part of  what trialsdo, 

they're also how we as a society express our values andthere's a reason why crim es like 

m urder, quote, unquote murder,also crimes like genocide, there's no s
ta tu te of  lim ita tion s, 
because they really
 
--
 
t he evil doesnot
 
--
 
didnotdissipate with thepassage of time. The last 
thing I would say related tothat, too, istrials are of ten a way that we learnm uchmore about 

thehistorical record and how crim es are comm itted.  Just a year or two ago there was a trial of  

a man in Germ any, also quite elderly, ref erred to in the presence ofbookkeeper of Auschwitz, 

he helped to process valuables that were conf iscatedf rom  prisoners. T hroughthat trial we 

learned a greatdeal about the mechanism s,them asstheft that was part of the genocide. So 

it's notonly about the fateor how m uch punishm ent can you give aperson at theend of his lif e 

butalso about establishing an unimpeachable record so people who m ight deny t
he se  crim e s 
can see thatthe perpetrators them selves gave testim ony of it. And I think that's very valuable.  

W e have a question here.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Yes.  First of all, thank you, Dr.
 
Munzer, f or had outstanding tim e 
you're spending with us.  W hat can
 
we learnfrom  your mother af ter the war, af ter losing two 
daughtersand her husband and all she wentthrough inthe cam ps?W hat can we learnf rom  

her? 
 
Al Munzer: W hat we learnf rom her, what I learnedf rom  her is theincrediblehum an 
spirit.  You know,
 
thefact that she was able to start lif e over again, to continue with life, I think 
probably one very im portant reasonfor thatwas that shef ound me alive and she hadmeto 

take care of.  You know, m y mother usedto rem indm e of that story of  Hannah that
 
I told you 
about. And Hannah made a pledge, she said if the alm ighty will gi ve  m e a child, I will gi ve that 

child tothe service ofGod all of  thedays of his or her lif e.  Andm y m other emphatically would 

rem ind me of that pledge, I saidthe sam e thing.
 
Edna Friedberg:  No pressure.
 
Al Munzer:  SoI wantyou to succeed.  I want you to do the right thing in your lif e. And 
that's something that really inf luenced me and probably wh y I becam ea doctorand I've tried to 

live up to thatpledge for m y lif e. 
 
E
dna Friedberg: W ehave tim efor onef inal question. T here was apersonhere.
 
Audience Mem ber:  I'd like to thank you again so muchfor your very special and 
touching stories about your f am ily, both by birth and yourf osterfam ily.  But I'm  curious tohea
r 

your opinionsaboutthe ongoing refugee crisis in Europeand rising anti
-
Muslim  sentiments 
thatare occurring in places such as the Netherlandsand any parallels you thinkm ight exist 

between these two topics. 
 
Al Munzer:  I think it'sextrem ely
 
--
 
it ' s  
just disheartening isn't eventhe word.  You know, 
I thinkthe greatesttragedy, tom e,of the Holocaust wasn't just that I was deprived of  afather 

or deprived of the companionshipof  two sisters, but it was thatthe world didnot learn the 

lessons of  the
 
Holocaust.  Did notban hatredanddiscrim ination,that we did not see an end to 
atrocities perpetrated by go vernm entsand that they continue to be aneedf or refugees. And, 

you know, oneof  the
 
--
 
if m yf am ily had beengiven refuge ina country l ike the
 
United States, 

13
 
 
or anywhere else, Im ight have had afatherandI m ighthave had,you know, sisters who were 
alive.  So Ifeel very m uch, you know, for therefugees who aretrying to f inda safeplace,a 

saf ehaven. And I very m uch hope that therewi ll be
 
an end at som e point to the need for 
refugees. But in themeantim e, I think we have an obligation in the world toprovide a safe 

shelterfor the peoplewho are seeking it. 
 
Edna Friedberg:  AndAl does more than hope.  I shouldm entionhe's in the middle
 
of  a 
tour actually around the country with a young Syrian refugee,a man nam ed Mouaz aspartof  

the Centerfor Prevention of Genocide. I would encourage you to look at our website and see 

the various program s and initiatives we do to raise awarenessand influence the policy m akers.  

W eare out of tim e. I know that Al, Dr.
 
Munzer, wi ll be happy to stay andanswer your 
questions,talk to you afterwards, but it is our traditionat" First Person"  thatthe " First Person"  

guest has the last word so I will turn
 
it over to you for any closing thoughts.
 
Al Munzer:  My thought is what I said earlier, it is possible, even when surrounded by 
things that are wrong, surroundedby evil, it's still possible to do what is right.  And that is,I 

th in k, m y
 
--
 
the m ost im por
tant message that I really want to leavewith you.
 
Edna Friedberg:  Thank you for sharing yourfam ily's history with us,and thank youf or 
joining us today.
 
(Applause).
