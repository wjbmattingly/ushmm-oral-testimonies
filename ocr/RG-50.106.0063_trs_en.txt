ARLETTE DE LONG 
May 23, 1997
 
 
Question: This is an interview for the U.
S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.  We are 
interviewing Arlette de Long.  My name is 
Ester Finder.  Today™s date is May 23, 1997.  
This is Tape 1, Side A.  Can you tell me  what your name is? 

Answer:  My name is
 Arlette de Long. 
Q: Could you sp ell that for me? 
A: A-R-L-E-T-T-E  D-E  L-O-N-G. 
Q: Was that your name at birth? 

A: No.  At birth I was called -- my first 
name, Arlette, Waldmann, W-A-L-D-M-A-N-N. 
Q: When  were you born? 
A: I was born June 15
th
, 1937. 
Q: And where were you born? 
A: I was born in Brocourt, France. 
 It™s in the department of Somme. 
Q: Could you sp ell those for me, please? 

A: Yes.  B-R-O-C-O-U-R-T.  Somme, S-O-
M-M-E.  It™s in the north of France. 

Q: Did your fami ly have a long history in Fran ce? 

A: No.  My parents are not French.  My mo
ther came from Siberia -- she was born in 
Siberia, lived in Ch ina; came in France in 
1918 or ™20 to study medi
cine in Paris.  My 
father was born in Chernivtsi, which was Ro
mania, used to be Austria and he spoke 
German as his first language.  He came to Pa
ris also to study medicine and they met in 
medical school, and got married, and they came 
in the village, where I was born, in 1935.  

Interview with Arlette de Long

They  chose -- they chose that village becau
se once they  graduated from medical school, 
they had no money between them
selves at all.  So, they se
arched for a place that would 
have no physicians, a
nd I don™t know why it was in th
e north, exactly what was the 
process, but they found this village in wh
ich there were no doctors within about 30 
kilometers, or just -- or maybe 
less than that, 15. 
 So, they rented a house, settled down, 
and never told anybody that th
ey were Jews.  It was 1935 an
d they must -- the y  -- they 
had a good feeling for what wa
s happening, they were really
 -- had much forethought, and 
in fact I think this is what saved our lives, 
because even though in
 the village I™m sure 
people knew we were Jewish, because we 
were this foreign fa
mily; Waldmann was the 
name, Waldmann (v ald-man), however they  spok
e with an accent.  
My grandparents had 
come from China to live w
ith us in 1937.  So, we
 suddenly were a very
 odd family in that 
village.  There were no Jews at all anyplace in
 this area.  But the fact that he was never 
officially announced that -- when I was a chil
d -- when I was born on -- I have papers.  I 
don™t know if it happened in th at (?sho-let-ry?)
 or not, but I have papers that I™ve been 
baptised.  I think the only pe
rson who knew the truth was the 
priest in the village, who did 
not speak.  No one spoke.  
No -- no one told the Germans 
that we were Jews, o r no one 
made a concerted effort to get us out. 
Q: When  you were growing 
up, did your parents speak 
to you ab out your family 
background and any traditions with  respect to religion? 
A: No. Well, during the war certainly not, but I 
didn™t really - no.  I have no idea.  I know 
very little about my grandparents
 on my father™s side.  T h ey 
died -- his father died during 
the war, and his mother just a mo nth after I 
was born, and my  father never, never, never 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
5 
spoke about that.  I asked a few questions, but 
I have no idea who they were, what their 
life was like.  My grandparents; I don™t kno
w if they were religious or not.  My 
grandfather died when I was ei
ght and my  grandmother died wh
en I was here in America, 
I forget, 40, and she looked old.  If there was 
a tradition, I don™t know.  What happened is 
when  I was 10 I moved to the subu
rbs of Paris; my parents follo
wed a year later.  I spent a 
year with my  grandmother there.  When my  
father came, he joined
 a synagogue in -- in 
the town where we were, the suburbs of Paris,
 called Le Raincy, and it was -- of course in 
France we did not have reform, so it was a 
traditional synagogue with the woman going 
upstairs, and then we started going to that. 
 I had no -- really no understanding much.  I 
wasn™t told very 
much about the religion, 
I don™t think.  Believing in God or not, I felt 
was mo re sort of my  business.  It wasn™t 
a family thing, and when  I was 13-14 I stopped 
believing anyway, and for me 
it w as more complicated, becau
se I had gone to church 
when I was little in 
the village, and so.... 
Q: Let™s back up. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Do you have any memo
ry of your life before 
the beginning of the war? 
A: None at all. 
Q: What were your first me mo ries? 
A: My first memory was being under a table 
with my  grandmother holding onto  me, to 
my shoulder.  I wanted to ge
t from under the table and she wa
s very determined to keep 
me there.  The reason was -- later on I was to
ld that there were bombs.  And now, this was 
not in our village.  At some time d u ring th
e war, and I don™t know when exactly, although 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
6 
I think I was pretty young.  I mu st have been 
ab out two and a half years old, or three, my  
mother -- my father jo
ined the army, the Fren
ch army, as a volunteer.  My mother and 
grandparents left the village, we had a car, 
and we went down to
 (?cam-pare?), or 
someplace in Normandy.  I™m not 
absolutely sure what
 the purpose of the trip was.  My 
father later said that my gran
dparents want, and my mother 
wanted to leave France.  Was 
it because -- was my mother trying to leav
e, you know, just go aw ay?  The story is 
unclear.  The marriage was bad, so it might ha
ve been.  Anyway , a
pparently my father 
discovered them.  It™s a
ll very unbelievable.  I don™t know what the truth is.  They will not 
tell me what the story is.  But after a while we
 came back to our ho
use in the village and 
my father -- well, the army, th
e French army, surrendered very
 quickly.  So -- but maybe 
it was -- I must have been -- it 
was -- mu st have been in the beginning of the war, because 
there was no French army very soon after.  So, th
is is my first memory.  After that I don™t 
have any for a long time.  I remembered the 
village, you know, my life in the village.  I 
remember -- I remember really (?bar-is-son?). 
Q: After that episode that you just talked 
about, did you go back 
then to the village? 
A: No. 
Q: Did your fami ly ma ke any 
effort to change their name? 
 Or to, perhaps, conceal any 
suggestion that they might be Jewish? 

A: No, because people already knew them by
 their name before 
the war.  Since they 
hadn™t said they were Jewish, they just kept
 on with the same pretense, so-to-speak.  
There were no special -- there was no sp
ecial effort that I can think of. 

Interview with Arlette de Long

Q: Do you remember the war ye
ars in this village?  Did you 
-- was -- were you touched at 
all by the war? 
A: No.  Well, yes and no.  Of course, we were
 touched by -- the things I remember is the 
food shortages, but they  weren™t real food shortages.  There was no -- there was no 

chocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time, 

and my  best friend too, owned 
a store, a grocery store, and I rememb er I used to go th ere 
every day and lo oking at the chocolate that 
was displayed, and the candies and wanting 
some, but everything was rationed, so I c
ouldn™t have them, and so, that was really 
memory for me.  There were no explanation, 
of course.  I reme mb er wooden shoes, shoes 
with wooden soles that were heavy.  I reme
mber one time an American or British soldier 
on a parachute came down, and I 
think he died, and the village
rs got his parachute, which 
was stained with blood, I think I saw it, but 
my  mo ther had taken th
e - the thread of the 
parachute and had 
-- and knitted a jacket for me, sweate
r, which I absolutely hated, maybe 
because it had that connotations.  Also, it 
was slippery, it was white, and I remember 
hating it.  I don™t ever rememb er wearing it, though.  I mu st have. 

Q: Do you remember German
 soldiers in your town? 
A: Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I used to
 play with them, with
 some of them.  We had a big house.  
We had -- relatively, for the village.  We had 
a house with -- eventua
lly indoor plumbing.  
I think we had it during the war already.  Bu
t we had a brick house,
 and the -- we didn™t 
have a bathroom -- bathroom that I know.  I me
an, I used to take baths outside in a tub of 
water, and the house was joined to -- to anothe
r house, there were two of them, and in th e 
house next door to us there was an old, 
old lady who lived  there with a -- who had a 

Interview with Arlette de Long

beautiful garden full of flower
s.  The Germans took that ho
use, took that part of the 
house, made her move, and we stayed in our 
part.  We had a garden too, but not so many 
flowers, we had strawberries and potatoes an
d things.  The two yard s were contig uous so 
that I used to -- the soldiers 
were there -- when they were in
 the yard, I used to go there 
too.  I remember my mother sa
ying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave 
me some, because they could be
 poisoned.  I don™t know if I 
knew, but I knew -- I have a 
feeling that I knew th ere was a secret.  I don™t think I knew we were Jews, especially.  It™s 

like I had a feeling maybe they  were bad, 
but I was too young to understand, really, 
whether they were bad or not.  It was confus
ing.  The soldiers were not difficult towards -
- I mean, th ey didn™t harm th
e -- t h e population.  
They lived with us, 
they occupied the 
village, but to a child they l
ooked like different people, bu
t the people, they were not 
especially frightened, I don™t think. 

Q: Was there every any fighting in your village? 

A: No.  We had a little bit of -- some men join
ed the Résistance, I th ink, but it was more a 
gesture, I think.  When -- we didn™t have 
bombs.  Bombs didn™t fall on us.  They fall -- 
fell on the village not too far from us.  Beca
use they had V8s, th
ey had bunkers, the 
Germans, and they were sendi
ng the V8 to Germany from th
at place.  So, they could 
bomb quite a bit, but not us.  There were 
about 10 kilometers 
away from our house. 
Q: Did your parents seem at all uncomfortable
, or nervous, when the Germans were near 
them? 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
9 
A: Oh, yeah.  I -- my parents were very anxi
ous.  Yeah.  My father spoke German.  You 
know, this was his mother tongue
.  So, I think that that was very useful.  I think he treated 
the German soldiers as we
ll as the French people, a
nd that was helpful for us. 
Q: What languages did you speak in your home? 
A: We spoke two languages.  I spoke Russian
 with my  grandfather and grandmother and 
my mother, and French with my  father and my mother too. 

Q: Did you have any id ea what a Jew was? 
A: No. 
Q: Had th ere been any discussion about Je
ws, to the best of your reco llection? 
A: No. 
Q: In those.... 
A: No. 

Q: Did your parents have any discussions that
 you might have been 
present for, or you 
might have overh eard, about wh at was 
happening in other 
parts of Europe? 
A: You know, I don™t think I had any knowle
dge of concentration 
camp s or any -- any 
such thing at all.  I knew the Germans were bad.  There was killing and bombs.  There 

was danger and I knew there was something 
very bad and that the Germans -- w e were 
hoping would leave.  That™s about as far as it got. 
Q: Did you get a sense from the people in the 
village that they knew
 something of your 
family secret, or they were 
protective of you in any way? 
A: No, I didn™t -- no, not at all.  I though
t -- we had a privilege
d position, being the 
doctor.  My father was respected.  He was a goo
d doctor.  He is, yeah.  He was well liked.  

Interview with Arlette de Long  
10 
He was quite devoted  to his people.  He used 
to go by car, by -- firs
t by bicycle, then my  
motorcycle, and then by car, 
all around wh en people were sick.  If people didn™t have 
money he treated them for free.  We always 
had fo od because the farmers would give us 
things to eat.  So, I felt really a little spec
ial being his daughter, bu
t not in any different 
way than that when I was a ch
ild.  I didn™t know any differe
ntly -- I was never confronted  
by (?____?) or I didn™t suffer 
in any way fo r being a Jew. 

Q: When  you lo ok back to those years dur
ing the war, are there any ep isodes, or any 
memories, that stand out in your mind? 
A: Yes.  That was at th e end of the war; I 
was -- mu st have been eight and it was in the 
spring, or in the summer; it was early in th
e mo rning and my  -- oh, by th at time we had 
moved.  The German had to -- Germans took our
 house.  So, they  made us mo ve, and we 
moved in the village next door to us, but th
ey were detached to each other.  So, it was 
really like (?___?) village with an old lady
, and it was very early, my grandmother, she 
came in the room, shook me, and said, ﬁWake up,
 wake up, we™ve got to run.ﬂ  So, we ran 
outside and hid in th e chicken coup.  What 
had happened is -- and my mo ther was inside 
the house and my  father and grandfather we
re running away towards the (?____?).  The 
Germans had come to everybody, but we didn™t kn
ow that at first, an d they made us go in 
front of the (? Merie ?), they separated the 
townhouse, they separated the men, the women 
and the ch ildren, they  brought trucks and th ey
 were going to ship  us to Germany because 
something had happened, I™m not
 sure what.  The food had 
been stolen, or someone had 
been killed, but it was really frightening.  Th
ey shot towards my gr
andmother and me, but 
didn™t -- didn™t -- missed us.  But it was pretty 
scary.  And I remember so standing in the 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
11 
garden  for a minute, and th e old lady who wa
s with us in her nightgown.  Then I 
remembered spending some tim
e with the other children an
d our teacher.  I remember 
seeing François, the woman who 
had the grocery store, she was very pregnant at the time 
and she was crying.  I also reme mber crying
, but I didn™t know why I was crying, but I 
saw all the kids crying, so I 
figured -- I mean, I knew I was feeling bad, but I wasn™t sure 
why -- what the danger was.  So, that was a 
significant memory.  I remember th at.  But 
again, it was not because we were Jews, 
it was because we were in the village. 
Q: What happened to  the people that the Germans had collected? 
A: Oh, they collected all of us.  The priest ta
lk ed them out of taking us to Germany.  We 
were lucky. 
Q: Can you tell me about your earl
y days in school during the war? 
A: My first school -- I don™t rememb er very we
ll, whether I was four or five, five maybe, 
when I went.  It was a Catholic school.  
The teacher made us sing songs about Vive 
Pétain, which my  parents mu st have loved 
when I™d come home.  I had no idea who 
Pétain was, or whatever it was.  I remember
 we had a gard en, we 
were planting a garden, 
work ing in the garden  on th e slope next to the 
church and I rememb er loving that.  It was 
fun. 
Q: Tell me about this song. 
A: I don™t know any more than 
Vive Pétain was part of the song.  After that I w ent -- and 

that might have been after the war, I don™t know 
th e changes at all.  I went to one school, 
one room school, in the village and there were
 kids from the age of seven -- I might have 
been -- I mi ght have been
 there.  From the age of -- before
 the war ended.  From seven to 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
12 
fourteen we were all together
 with one teacher, and I remember th e teacher screaming at 
us because you can imagine boys and girls, ev
erybody in one room, and I used to talk a 
lot.  I would talk and talk and talk.  So, they
 -- she had me sit alone under her nose, which 
I did not like. 
Q: What kinds of thin
gs did you study?  Wa
s there anything that you studied during th e 
war that you might not have studied if there hadn™t been a war? 

A: I don™t think so.  I just studied how to read
 and write and add.  It was really simple.  I 
mean, I was very much behind.  When I move
d to (?____?) it took me a year to catch up, 
because I barely -- I knew some th
ings, but very much less than 
other kids did.  It™s hard 
to know how the war affected  us, because by the time I h a
ve any memory at all, you 
know, that was all I knew. 
Q: Did you have any regular cont
act with the German soldiers? 
A: (?____?) 

Q: Except to run into 
them in the garden? 
A: No.  No. 
Q: Were there any -- to the best of your reco llections, were there any restrictio ns or rules 

imposed by the Germans on the villagers? 
A: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think 
we had to blackout the windows, we did that ourselves.  I 
don™t -- I have a very, very va
gue memo ry, that may have been
 an early memory of -- we 
had a trench  in the garden and going in  there, 
seems like in the evening, or at night, wh en  
-- when there were airplanes above us.  The 
airplanes were scary because you never knew 
what they  were going to do, wh ere the bombs
 would fall.  They never fell on us, but it 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
13 
was -- I think th ey were -- you kn
ow, the fo od restrictions, which I reme mb er the mo st.  I 
think -- I was told, I didn™t know that, but I wa
s told you couldn™t butcher animals.  Gas, 
gasoline was rest ricte d . 
Q: Were your movements restrict
ed in any way?  Travel or.... 
A: Not th at I knew, no. 
Q: When  you were in school 
and you said that you attended
 church , when  you were in 
church... 
A: Mm hm.  
Q: ...was any mention ever made of Jews and 
Judaism?  In any way 
shape or form that 
you can recall? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er anything about Jews
.  I rememb er being -- the priest talking 
about Jesus and me developing a great love 
fo r -- for a man who was described as loving 
children, and I think for me the co nnection was, my family was not very loving and it was 
nice to have an idea that so
meplace there was somebody who was looking after you.  So, 
that™s what I remember about 
the church.  It was -- it wa
s a good place.  I liked it. 
Q: Did your parents attend 
church  along with you? 

A: No, no.  My parents did no
t, and I think they were very
 -- my mother is, I remember, 
was very unhappy if I -- I alwa
ys wanted to  cross my self a
nd I don™t know if -- when I 
was a kid if I could do it or not, but afterwards
, it was forbidden.  It was like a very bad 
thing, and yet, it™s funny, ev en to this day, wh en some
thing really bad happens, you 
know, the impulse is still there on me to do it. 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
14 
Q: Was it unusual for adults to miss church a
ttendance?  Did -- was anybody -- so, your -- 
you™re shaking your head, you 
need to give me an answer. 
A: Sure.  Yeah.  No, it wouldn™t have been 
-- especially the men, they didn™t necessarily 
go that much.  It was the family we were frie
ndly with, François and her husband, Marcel.  
For instance, Marcel was a communist.  I don™t 
know if he was a communist at that time, 
or if it existed, but he was fiercely anti-religi
on.  Oh , he hated the priest.  He hated the 
idea of -- it™s funny, he still is.  His wi
fe, of course, was Cat
holic.  Everybody was 
Catholic in the village.  Yo
u know, everybody had been ba
ptised.  And -- you know, I 
don™t think she went mu ch to 
church, either.  I mean, you we
re Catholic because that was 
part of your -- of your way 
of living, ev eryone was bap
tised, it was normal.  But you 
didn™t have to practice.  So, that not very
 many people would go 
to church.  But they 
would go in the priest if they
 were sick.  I mean, you took no
 chances, and baptisms were 
oblig ated, communion, first communion. 

Q: Did you participate in any of
 the Catholic rituals, other th an going to church, was there 
anything above -- above that level 
of observance that you engaged in? 
A: I didn™t -- well, I w ould have been too 
young fo r first communion, and I don™t think 
there is mo re children take comm union. 
Q: Were there any church events, or anythi
ng like that?  Maybe I should have made the 
question mo re clear. 
A: I very faintly think th ere was a ceremony, 
something with flowers, and I don™t know if 

I went or not. 
Q: Did your family observe 
Christmas in your house? 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
15 
A: No.  They didn™t observe 
-- observe many holidays, no Jewish
 holidays, in those days.  
Not Ch ristmas™s.  I may have gotten a book, 
or something like th at.  May have gotten a 
present, but no. 
Q: And not Easter? 
A: No.  No, Easter was not part of the (?___?). 

Q: When  you lo ok back on those days, do 
you have a sense that people really knew you 
were Jewish, or do you have a sens
e now as an adult, looking back... 
A: Mm hm. 

Q: ...do you have a sense that ma ybe they  weren™t sure? 

A: I don™t think they were sure in the sense th
at they had proof, or they had seen any signs 
of being Jewish, or like Yamika, or any of th
e traditional signs.  Of course, there were no 

synagogues in the village, you 
would have to go 40 kilomete
rs to the town.  So, they 
didn™t have solid proof.  On the other hand, 
I think the name is a Jew ish name by itself, 
Waldmann, apparently, Waldmann (vald-man), my
 parents were -- they had dark hair and 
-- everybody in the family looks mo re Jewish th
an I do.  I™m the only one with this lighter 
hair and blue eyes, and so, I think everybody
 suspected.  I think it was pretty common 
suspicion or knowledge.  Yeah. 
Q: Was your -- to your knowledge, again, wa
s there any incentive fo r the town™s people, 
or the villagers, to pursue this
, or to turn you in as a su
spected Jew?  Was there any 
motivation, or incentive, 
for this kind of act? 
A: Yes and no.  It™s -- it™s an interesting story.
  For -- for most of the people I don™t think 
there was any incentive, because  my father was the doctor a
nd he helped 
everybody and 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
16 
he was well liked.  So, there was no reason to 
kill the village doctor
 and then be left 
without anybody.  On a personal level, it wa
s interesting and more complicated, because 
much later on, about 10 
years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that™s what my mother 
had told me that no one knew in 
the village.  It was a very we
ll-kept secret 
and that™s why 
we never had any troubles.  
I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my  father™s 
mistress, and this was comm
on knowledge in the village
, everybody knew, and he 
certainly would have had incentive to get rid of
 him, and he didn™t.  He -- he was the one 
who told me when I mentioned 
that nobody knew we were Jews
 in t h e village, he started 
to laugh and said, ﬁEverybody 
knew, but we were not animals.
ﬂ  So -- so, we were saved 
by the grace, in a way, of this man, and of 
the whole village.  Cert
ainly they could have 
gotten rid of us. 
Q: Did th e man say any mo re to you in  your conversation 10 years ago? 

A: I don™t remember.  It™s inte
resting, because we -- we have 
all -- we are all friendly still.  
But it is also a taboo subject.  The relationshi
p between my  father a
nd François -- when I 
speak to François, which I do 
quite often from here, I call he
r.  We have never, never 
mentioned -- she calls my father Dr. Valmon (p
h), because they have changed their name 
since, and it™s all really kind of funny, but I 
feel that she wants her privacy an d it™s not to 
me -- for me to -- to invade it, although 
I am very curious and I would like to ask 
questions about their relationship, and wh at
ever happened back 
then.  But (?___?). 
Q: There must have been many 
other events that occurred during the war years, in your 

life.  Can you reconstruct some of what
 your life was like during those years? 
A: I have very few memories of my childhood.
  The war years in --
 in a way, well it™s a 

Interview with Arlette de Long

paradox, but when I was 10 and I moved to  live 
in the suburbs of Paris, this was to me a 
much more painful even
t than any of the war years.  I 
lik ed living in the village.  I was 
happy there despite the war, and despite the di
fficulties, it was a better time in my life, 
and so, the -- the loss at the same time 
when I was eight, after the war ended my 
grandfather died and that was a tremendous 
loss to me, and -- and I have very, very few 
memories of -- maybe the two years before he 
died and none -- none 
at all between eight -
- eight and ten and a half.  I have absolute no me
mories at all.  It™s 
all erased.  But I have 
one memory at the end of the 
war, I remember, it was -- we we
re standing in  front of my  
house with my family, I think,
 and two tanks came with e
ither American or Canadian 
soldiers, and the Germans stood in between th e soldiers, in between the tanks, and they 
threw their hands up in the air and their w eapons fell down, and the soldiers threw us 
gum, wh ich we™ve never seen, like, you kept that
 piece of gum and chewed on it, I think, 
for two weeks.  At night I wo
uld put it away.  And that was 
it.  That was the end of the 
war, and then the woman next -- across the stre
et from us, she was a spinster.  Apparently, 
she had been sleeping with a 
soldier -- with some soldiers
, which -- it makes me laugh, 
because when I was a child I thought of her 
as so ancient.  You know, it was like a 90-
year-old wo man; maybe she was 30 or 40, who 
knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it 
was -- it was kind of comical to think of her 
sleeping with everybody.  She got her head 
shaved. 
Q: Which soldiers was she -- German or.... 

A: German.  We only had Germans. 
Q: Not -- not the liberating soldiers. 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
18 
A: Oh hell, no.  They  woul
dn™t have -- nobody in  France
 would shave your head for 
sleeping with a man, but soldie
rs, you know, German soldiers. 
Q: We have to pause to change tapes.  
  
...TAPE CHANGE. 

 

Question: This is Tape 1, side B.  We are 
interviewing Arlette de Long.  And you were 
telling me about the woman who had her head shaved... 

Answer: Yes.  

Q: ...for having slept with German... 
A: Soldiers. 
Q: ...with German soldiers... 

A: Or soldiers. 

Q: ...or a German soldier. 
A: A German soldier.  I didn™t know anythi
ng about it, of course, until, you know, after 
the war.  Her name was Mademo iselle Levon
 (ph) and it -- I don™t know.  You know, 
things were done, I think, peop
le got self-righteous in the village afterwards, but I really 
don™t know much about it.  Unfortunately after 
that, I have no memories.  That™s my last 
memo ry . 
Q: You mentioned earlier about moving... 

A: Mm hm. 
Q: ...to the suburbs of Paris. 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
19 
A: Mm hm. 
Q: Why did your family move? 

A: Ostensibly the reason was because I needed
 a better education.  The truth was that 
Amiens, which was a big town 40 kilometers 
away, could have provided  a perfectly good 

education for me as a board er and I could ho
me on the weekends, but my  mo th er wanted  
to move.  Sh e wanted  out of 
there, which was understandable.
  My father did not, but 
eventually  he gave in, and so, we moved. 
Q: And you also mentioned earlier that it was 
in -- in this new home that your father 
joined a synagogue. 
A: Mm hm. 
Q: Can you tell me your first me mo ries
 of your in troduction to Judaism?  
A: Yes.  Unfortunately, they 
were very, very negative.  Ev
en  though I was, you know, 11 
at least, I don™t think my  parents had explai
ned to me any -- any of what was -- what had 
happened.  And also, because at
 th e same time I was going to the Girl Scouts and the Girl 
Scouts were Protestant, the troop, and so, I was 
-- I went back to chur
ch, but this time to 
the Protestant temple, which 
again, I liked, because at le
ast they spoke English -- or 
French.  You know, I could understand some of 
it.  But I remember -- and I have it to this 

day, I am ashamed of the feeling, but I can™t he
lp it, sort of visceral
 dislike for the way the 
people looked, the Jews looked, because I di
d not know that those were the survivors.  
You know?  So, they  looked  battered and th
ey  looked sad and they  looked  grey, you 

know?  I didn™t know any of 
that, and so, they  looked aw ful to me, you know, those 
people compared to the Cat
holic who were young and, you
 know, in good health and 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
20 
certainly didn™t have the past.  So, I wished I 
-- I wanted to be like all the other girls.  I 
wanted to go to church, you know, legitimately.
  I wanted to take communion, I wanted to 
continue believing in  Ch rist 
and -- you know, and then  -- by 
then it was a terrib le thing, 
and I was required to hate -- hate the Christia
ns, but I had no whelm of hatred in me for 
Christians. 
Q: Why were you required to hate the Christians? 

A: That was my mother™s call
 for allegiance, so-to-speak.  If I loved her, you know, I was 
to love her and hate -- love th
e Jews, hate the Christians, but you can™t make yourself.  So, 
what happened was the 
opposite mostly, and th e synagogu
e was terribly boring.  I had to 
sit upstairs.  I™m an only child, so I didn™t ha
ve any siblings to commiserate with.  I was 
sitting there with my mother, who didn™t beli
eve in anything, and was, you know, just 
sitting there and I think she was talking with
 other women.  The rituals didn™t -- you 
know, I missed the church ritual and the resp ec
t when  you go in  the ch
urch; you™re quiet, 
you pray.  There, it was just sort of sitting up 
there watching men in dark suits downstairs.  
The rabbi, who was mean a
nd ugly.  His wife, who was -- her hair was -- head was 
shaved, she was wearing a wig and the wig didn™
t fit, and I was just there and I hated it, 
but I hated it guiltily because I was expected 
not to, and it meant no -- I didn™t believe in 
God by then.  I felt it didn™t make sense to me. 
 And so , I just put in time because I had to. 
Q: When  did you learn about wh at happened
 to the Jewish people in other parts of 
Europe? 
A: You know, I really stayed 
away from knowledge.  I didn™t want to learn, I didn™t want 
to know, I didn™t want to be part of it; I ma
rried a Methodist, who was 
not practicing.  It™s 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
21 
not that I -- I hid that I was Jewish.  I always
 said I was Jewish, beca
use I feel you™re born 
this way, you can™t erase it.  But I never iden
tified with the Jews.  I 
thought it was more of 
a curse to be born a Jew.  And so, I really 
didn™t want to know, and in terestingly it™s my  
daughter, when she was 16, she started asking
 me questions about the Holocaust and I 
said to her, you know, ﬁI don™
t know mu ch  and you surely don™t need to know, it™s too 
horrible, forget it.ﬂ  But she 
needed to know.  
She started to read.  I started having 
nightmares, and so, I needed to
 help her.  So, I - I started 
myself to read a little bit and 
become, you know, more knowle
dgeab le, so I could talk to her.  And it was -- she is now 

29, so it was a slow -- a very slow progressi
on.  I still, you know, haven™t seen (?Schorr?) 
or I haven™t seen that new movie, Schindler™s 
List, because I am very visual and if I see 
something like that it™s going to  haunt me 
for months and months
 and months, if not 
years.  And I figured, I went to the Holocaus
t Museum and I went through it in a daze, I 
don™t rememb er mu ch, except for the shoes a
nd th e car -- the wagon.  It™s about all I 
reme mb er -- oh no, the pictur
e, the tower of pictures. 
Q: After the war, did your pare
nts make any efforts to find some of the people, relatives, 
friends, that they grew up with 
before they came to France? 
A: No.  My mother is an on
ly child.  But my grandmother 
was one of 12, I think.  So, 
there mu st have been a lot of people in Ru ssia, but they  never made any attemp t -- any 

effort at knowing the family, or I wasn™t -- 
I didn™t know their name or anything.  My 
father was one of four.  I have an uncle wh
o lives in Munich, who 
I think may have been 
in a camp and came out.  I met 
him once.  Then -- and then th
e rest of the family, I don™t 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
22 
know.  I didn™t even know thei
r names.  So my parents, we -- we really, really  cut 
themselves off entirely 
from family (?___?).  
Q: Did you ever experience a
ny anti-Semitism in France? 
A: No, except for an occasional remark.  Pe
ople don™t think of me -- people who don™t 
know, don™t think of me as Jewish .  I think it™
s because Arlette is su
ch an unJewish name, 
or when I was growing up.  
Personally, no.  I can™t reme
mb er having been  directly 
attacked.  The funny thing that
 happened -- the funn
iest thing that happened to  me was in 
America, and it was a funny story, because I 
was driving in a car with a woman who was 
a social worker and also a nun, and her frien
d, and the nun did not know I was Jewish and 
as we™re driving, some -- some car cuts her o
ff and she says, ﬁOh, that™s a Jew.  They are 
so pushy.ﬂ  At which point I thought, ﬁI can™
t let you get away with  that.ﬂ  So, I said, ﬁI 
am a Jewﬂ, and she was so embarrassed.  It 
w as funny, but it was also pretty innocent, I 
felt.  And so, once in a while I hear remarks 
like that.  Some -- some
 woman who told me 
about somebody trying to ﬁJew
ﬂ her.  But I very often --
 I didn™t -- I knew the woman 
very slightly, and I -- I don™t 
pick up on those things, becaus
e I don™t -- I feel they™re too 
stupid, you know, I™m not going 
to  give them -- honour them with a response.  So, I™ve 
been quite lucky, in retrospect. 
Q: When did you come to the United States? 
A: I came in 1962, and I originally came fo
r a vacation, three weeks™ vacation, then I 
decided to  spend a year to learn the language 
and also to get away, and th en I met my  ex-
husband at Stanford  and within  six weeks we 
were married.  We stayed married 10 years, 
and have tw o ch ildren, and once I had the ch
ildren I could not see taking th em to France 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
23 
and cutting them -- basically it 
would have been cutting them 
off from their fath er, which 
I did not want to do to them. 
 I™d been enough -- through eno
ugh separations that I wasn™t 
going to impose that on them.  So, I st
ayed.  I stayed in this country. 
Q: When  you say you 
had been through enough separati
ons that you didn™t want to 
impose that on them; what are you referring to? 
A: Oh, I™m just thinking, y
ou know, about my grandfather 
and leaving the village, you 
know, those kinds of disruptions as a child.  Wh
en you™re a child what 
you need are roots.  
A divorce is bad enough, but you 
don™t want any deceptions, you
 don™t want any ch anges.  
So, that™s why I stayed here. 

Q: Did your parents stay married? 
A: Oh, yeah.  Mm hm.  
Q: When you look b
ack to your childhood  during the war... 
A: Mm hm. 

Q: ...are there any other memories, or feelings
, that you have, or anything else that might 
come to mind at this poin
t that you want to add? 
A: I think, for me, the war might have been 
like thunder in the b
ackground.  You know 
when  you hear thunder at the distance and in
 a way you don™t know whether it™s going to 
come closer or move away.  So, there is some
 sense of danger.  Like, there are planes in 
the night.  Years later when  -- I don™t even  
know.  Oh  no, there was one thing I never 
understood exactly why I felt that way, it was 
listening to machine gun fi
re, or any kind of 
gun shooting.  I don™t know if it was from th
at one experience, or what, but that would 
absolutely make me shake, 
and that surprised me, because
, you know, I was not really 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
24 
part of any very traumatic events that I ca
n think of, but that -- that - I would have a 
tremendous response to that.  I just couldn™t
 stand it.  Now, it™s getting better, but in 
movies I™m careful, because it could send me 
-- it used to.  I mean, I saw a movie and I 
shook fo r a good hour and cried.  So, there 
was a sense o f danger, I think, which I may 
have repressed or not want to deal with, 
because there was some other aspects of my  
childhood th at were good.  I cer
tainly wish it never had happened.  I mean, not only fo r 
all the others, of course, but personally that
 -- I don™t know it was damaging in so me ways 
that I don™t know.  I think it was the atmos
phere that was poisonous, but poisonous in a 
way that does a child to just 
absorb, but do not understand. 
Q: So, you don™t -- you don™t 
perceive any lasting fallout from your Holocaust -- your 
experiences during the war too? 

A: Oh, yeah.  I think so .  Well, I think it was e
ither thinking back on it,
 of course.  I think 
for me the most difficult thing was being a Je
w, because the experience was so mixed and 
so poorly integrated, and my sense of identity
 has been being -- being part of a group I 
never wanted to be part of, but that I could 
not leave, nor would I want to leave for sense 
of guilt.  I do have a sense of guilt, that™s one 
of the reasons I didn™t really want to tell the 
story because I feel, what do I have to tell,
 you know, so many people have suffered so 
terribly, as I know from the gr
oup here and children survivors.
  You know, I didn™t suffer, 
or -- why not?  There is this -- 
this survivor™s guilt.  It™s re
al.  It™s a real thing, and it 
certainly had a profound effect.  A sense of 
insecurity.  You know, 
you never know when  
you could be asked to 
move, or asked to leave.  You 
never know if a bomb will fall on 
your head.  But I think it was both, it was th
e war in general, which all the children, 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
25 
everybody in my time 
suffered from, and it was personal in
 the difficulty of being a Jew 
and having such strong identific
ation with -- with a man, w
ith Christ, with a religion 
which basically also doesn™t exist very much
; it™s an idea in my 
head.  The Catholic 
Church, I wouldn™t be part of it if you paid  
me at this time, becaus
e there are many things 
I think th ey are doing which are not (?___?), 
because they  didn™t figh
t the Germans either 
very much.  So, it™s a place that
™s sort of -- it™s sort of 
no-man™s-land, you know?  And 
that™s it. 
Q: Is there anything else you™d like to add befo
re we conclude the interview today?  I did 
want to ask you a little bit about your -- you
r life in this country and your professional 
career.  Would you mind sh aring ju st
 a few minutes with me on that? 
A: No.  I think my career -- I have -- I was lu
cky to -- to have found -- to have found a 
career that really met a lot -- a 
lot of needs for me, and in whic
h I have a sense of my  life.  
Having made a little d ifference, I 
worked with adults 
most of my life as a psychotherapist.  
I™m now going to work with child
ren, which I look forward to.  I think I have a sense of -- 
a sense, a n eed, a wish, of -- to help those who 
are less fortunate.  The greatest pain I have 
-- it™s funny, it™s interesting because it has nothi
ng to do with the war, or maybe it does, is 
of being in exile.  I did not really wanted to
 leave France.  I left mo stly to escape my 
parents, not the Germans.  I 
can™t go back.  I™d go back , but I cannot go back  because my  
children are here, my life is he
re, and all I know, I think, I su
rvived much be
tter than other 
people.  I was lucky.  And well, you know
, like many in New York, Jews are not Jews, 
we all pay the price for the time w e were born. 

Q: Are your parents still alive? 

Interview with Arlette de Long  
26 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
Q: Could you tell me their names? 

A: My father™s name is Joseph Valmon (ph).  
In 1955, ™53, I don™t 
know, something like 
that, he changed his name from Waldmann to
 Valmon (ph) wh en he became a French 
citizen.  And my mother™s name is Fanni Va
lmon (ph), and (?___?) was her ma iden name. 
Q: One final question. 

A: Mm hm. 
Q: You mentioned several times that yo
ur father was the town physician. 
A: Mm hm. 
Q: But you also mentioned that
 your mo ther went to medical
 school and that™s where they  
met. 

A: Mm hm.  

Q: Did your mother al
so practice medicine? 
A: My mother practiced medicine, but only in
 the house.  She never -- she was -- stayed 
in an auxiliary role.  She ne
ver went to see patients outside
, but patients came to the house 
and she practiced that way.  She was not a ve
ry (?___?) practitioner.  She preferred not to.  
But she -- she did help my  fath
er.  He was really the main 
one, person, in terms of work. 
Q: Thank you, and th is conclu
des our in terview today.

Question: We™re going to add a postscript.  
There was something else that you wanted to 
add, and I™ll give you th e opportun
ity to -- to make a fin al comment. 
Answer:  Okay.  One of the reasons I wanted to
 tell my story and this was very strong for 
me when I first started  thinking about it, was it 
is a story of hope and 
it is also a story that 
counteracts so many of the -- of the stories 
of people wh o had been tu rned  in by the 
French, who had been  persecuted,
 who had been betrayed .  In 
my case -- and it feels for 
no reason in a way, it was just pure kindness, 
or pure decency, on th e part of th e people.  
They were just -- they were not
 killers.  That™s what the ma
n said, ﬁWe are not animals.ﬂ  
Maybe (?___?) human nature is -- 
is very much that too.  That despite the other side of 
the story, that there is a lot of compassion a
nd I want to say than k you to the people wh o 
saved us, and also say that perhaps there 
were other stories like mine, but I™m not 

regarded because people may not think about 
telling them, or being in the position to tell 
them.  That I was not -- we were not alone
, my  family was not alone in having been 
helped.  As a matter of fact, there was a w
hole village in -- in the (?____?) in which the 
priest led all the people, to save the Jews, a
nd so, those are the stories that I want people 
to know about.  And that is it. 

Q: Thank you, and no
w we are concluded. 
A: Yes.  Yes.
