 Very.  Ever ythi ng was

to sc hool, but we wer e authoriz ed
 not to write, and there were neve
r test s given on Sat u rday.  So I

He bre w sc hool, als o?

two years of coll ege from
 t he  __________, whic h is
 -- do you wa nt me  t o s p
ell i t?   No, okay.  An d 
Ametz (ph), we we re very young,
 when Ametz woul d come t o the 
hous e and t eac h us  to rea d, but  
not to write or to --
 just reading.  Wh en I wa
s little, I went to 
a hyper.  And ther
e was no separatio n  
bet ween stat e and college, so we 
had a c olle ge t e achi ng in sc hool e v
ery week.  And all religion had 
-- we had t h e ______
___, who was l i ke a bi shop. 
 He was t he  rabbi o f th
e whole ar ea, the gener al  
area.  And he taught us, an
d to Catholic it's a prie
st and to Protestant the 
mi nister s.  We  all  have  
religi ous tea ching bec ause when Me tz reverte d to 
Fre nch rul e in 1918, the 
French wanted to keep  
the ___________ ver y happ
y.  And t hey are ver y  religi ous, s o
 they acce p ted beca use  Fra nce was 
always a state where r eli gion and 
state were separate.  But not in 
Lorr ai ne de la 
Cross, it wa s a  
speci al t hing. 
Q: Being Je wis h, were  your  frie nds
 J ewi sh or  Cat holic  or  mi xed?  
A: Ther e we re mostl y Ca tholic s and J ews.  I ha d in
 that school  there were 
quite a few Jews, but we 
wer e --  most  of the  ki ds  wer e Cat holi c. 

Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how
 i nte grate d Je wi s h pe opl e wer e  in
to the life of Metz, whether they 
had a  se parat e c o mmunity or  
whet her  you wer e all  Fre nch. 
A: No, no.  We  ha
d special communities, relig
ious.  We were very re
ligious anyway.  And my  
grandfat her had founded the _________, he had fo
unde d e ve rythi ng, you know, syna gogue s.  H e  
had founded ever ythi ng for the 
_______, e ver ything for t he orthod
ox.  Be caus e ________ was a  
very -- let 's s ee, I  try to fi nd t he 
word.  I see a little person in th
is syna gogue  at _______ whi ch wa s  
outsi de t he forbi dde n par t s, s o you se e, that 's th
e di fference.  But at the 
sa me t i me my pare nts a n d  
my grandfat her were very
 open-minded, and we  
al ways had Catholic fri ends, too, a nd t hat  was  
absolutely not follo
wi ng the ________. 
Q: Were you aware of any anti-Se mitism? 

A: Oh, sur e, sure .  I n t hat  city were many Ger ma n s,
 and in '33 or a little be
fore when Hi tler started  
to get mighty, the Ukraines who 
were of German descent were ve
ry much anti-Sem
itic and showed

it openly.  Wh en until 
then they showed
 it not perhaps as openly.  
But in 1936 when Leon Blume 
(ph)  ca me  to power, you 
re me mber t h at?   And he  wa
s Je wi sh, we  ha d t he First Mi niste r  a Je w.  And 
then there were real high-ups due to t hat.  And we
, my siste r  and I -- my sister was de fi nitel y wa s 
_________, we  ha d 
fi stfi ghts with the gi
rl s in schools about t hat beca
use then they showed openl y  
their anti- Semiti sm and we di d not
 accept  it.  No, how ca
n we be governed by 
a Jew?  Things like  
that, so t hat  we di d not  accept .  
Q: You fought back? 

A: Oh, ye ah.  I always fought.  My
 fat her was a very, very st rong pers
on.  Very authoritarian, but in 
the same way he did not 
accept.  I  remember  when 
I  was real  small chil d - -
 I don't  remember  what  
age , but ver y s mall -- we ca me 
out of the synagogue, wh ich was 
i n the bad neighborhood.  The  
synagogue was in the sl ums, and at t hat ti me ther e 
wer e lots of bad ki ds ou
t there.  Teenagers, and  
they start ed to cal l us dir ty Jews 
and throw stone.  An d my  fa ther 
took his belt off and just went 
aft er t he m, a nd I wa s ver y pr
oud of him.   I think that
's  why I  agreed to he lp. 
Q: And that probably
 i n fl uenced you?  
A: Possi bly, yea h.  But  we were  -- I don't know.  My
 brot her s and my sis t e r s 
and I -- just my ol dest  
sister , she was not t he fi ghti ng ki nd
.  But all were natural -- in fact
, we were on my father 's si de.  
Oth e r wise , we  were  mu ch mo re  lik e my  mo th
er, but for that we  were like my  father. 
Q: What doesthat
 me an, more l i ke  your mothe r ?  
A: M y mot h er wa s a ver y so ft 
a nd very unde rsta ndi ng a nd very -- 
she gr ew up with us.  And my  
fat her , he was a  authorit arian, he wa s a patri arc
h and t hat was that.  Th
er e was a big di fference 
bet wee n t he  two. 

Q: Do you r e me mbe r  your pare nts sa ying anyt hing to you about this ant i -Se mit is m, how di d the y  

respond why . . . 

A: Yes , s ure .  We di sc us sed it -- I don't re me mbe r  
if it wa s '2 7, 1927 or '2 9.  I don't reme mb er the  
year when Schwartzmann or  Sc
hwartz-kopf, the general in Fran
ce , t he Russia n ge ner al who had 
done s o ma ny pogr oms i n Pola nd a n d Rus sia.  I don
't remember if it was Po
l and, I t hi nk it wa s in 
Russia .  _________ was  a 
Russia n, and he kil l e d hi m i n the  st
reets of Paris.  And e very night  I

re me mber my ol de st brot her r eadi ng t he ne ws pape rs
 al oud to all the fa mily at the table what had 
happened t h at day as a cri me.  And that had a 
terrible re par ation on me .  I wante d t o bec o me a  
lawyer , t hat was t he goal  of my li fe
.  To be come  a lawyer
, but I re me mber  very 
well the deep -- and  
I was s o te rr ifi ed t hat pe ople  could - - did not ha ve
 pogroms .   I di dn't know muc h a b out it  be fore  
that.  And that gave me  
a n i nkli ng of what ha ppe ned i n t his  c o untrie s.   
Q: Were there any social or 
political organizations you were
 involved with
 as a girl?  
A: No, not r eally.  I was very fr
iendly with a Je wi sh gr oup who ha
d wor k i n an orga niz ation, but I  
never bel onged.  I ' m not very muc h 
of a bel onger to or gani zati ons .  
In general, I never in my li fe, 

you know, _______ and belo
nged to somet hing.  Th
e y were a  group of -- 
I don't re me mber what  
they were.  I tried to 
re me mb er.   It wa s  a Je wi
s h --  a  Zi oni st group, I don't  re me mber  e xa ctly. 
Q: And your father, your 
brot hers , t he y wer en't i nvolve d wit h t h at eit her?  
A: No, no.   

Q: You started to
 mention to Hitler.  
How mu ch did y
ou know about 
what was going on i n  
Ger many at  t he ti me?  

A: Oh, very mu ch.  We  knew it ev
ery day.  Since the age of 6, as 
soon I could read, I get the paper 
and re ad it.  I was al wa ys  and I a m sti ll very int ere
sted in peopl e and thi ngs
.  And I ke ep abreast of 
what 's goi ng on, not just in my countr y but in ev
er y country.  And we kne w exa ctly what was goi ng 
on, a nd we had relat ive s in Ger m
a ny.  My fat her ha d a  si ster 
in Germany, and they lived in 
Dussel dor f, whi ch i s not very far fr om Metz .  
And after Kristallnacht, 
the ne xt morning, t heir  
daught er c al l ed us .  It was her 
husba nd, t he Ge r ma ns  ca me  i n, th
e SS Gestapo they came in and 
we nt to arres t  hi m.  And s he ha d two small c hildre
n.  Jackie wa s by the n about 3; anot he r one, J osie ,  
wa s about  2;  and she wa s ver y pre
gnant wit h the third one.  And 
by chance, she was able t o tal k  
the m out  of arresti ng hi m on the s pot
.  And the n as s o
on t hey left --  they we
r e  goi ng t o c o me bac k  -
- as soon a s they l e ft, he ran a wa y to Hol l and.  Be caus e he had a br
ot her there, but s he staye d with  

the c hil dren.  So s he call ed us, and my ol der sist
er , Cecili a, we nt i m me diat ely by t r ain t o Ger ma ny 
and got the two children 
out.  And she made heil Hitler until sh
e had the baby an
d then she went 
wit h the  ba by to Holla nd.  And we
 kept J acki e, t he ol de st one -- we kept  duri ng t he whole war.

Bec ause his pare nts l ater we nt on one  of t hes e s hi ps 
who tried to go to Palestine, and they were all 
of them who wa nted --  it 
took them forever to be ab
le to land in Palestine.
  And once t h ey la nde d, 
the war started, so they never were able to get th
eir children.  And Jacki e
 live d with us a nd hi s  
brot her , Josi e, lived wit h  
my aunt, the sister of my
 father.  But these were 
on my fat her 's si de .  She  
wa s the sist e r  of my fat h er, I never met her.  I ne
ver met my a unt .  But I kne w her , too, beca use of  
Jacki e.  I knew Jac kie .  She  ha d c o
me  to France to see us , so J
acki e -- when I  tal k about what  
happe ned during the  war ,  he  was  al wa ys wit h us .   
Q: Was  th er e a  n u mber  o f  Ger ma n Je ws  wh o wer e
 coming we st and mo vi
ng i nto your  a rea?  
A: Oh, yeah.  Very much
 so, and every Jewish fa
mily of Metz who was a 
German fa mily during the 
time  that they we nt -- you know
, t hat  the y moved on, t he n a ft er 
that t hey moved 
on.  Bec ause we  
were too close to Ge rmany, nobody
 felt very comfortable 
ther e.  So, oh, yes, 
I remember very well 
the fa mil y who c a me t o s t ay with us .  I don't r e
me mb er t heir n a me, but I re me mb er ver y w e ll t hey  
were there.  I don't re
me mber how long, two week
s, and then they moved 
on.  But we all helped. 
Q: Is t here a nyt hing else you want to t ell me about Me
tz or your  fa mil y or t h e kind of li fe  you li ve d?   
We re you - -  you wer e fi ni
shing up s chool  at about
 the time of the war? 
A: Before, I fi nished in 
' 18.   An d I wa s 1 7 wh e n
 I fi nished school , a nd we ha d a ve ry e xtende d  
fa mi ly and we lived -- you know, we  were ver y cl ose 
to my gr andpare nts .  Ver y, very cl ose to the m.   
And my gra ndfat her  di e d on Pa ss ov
er, t he eve Passover  in 
'39.  And t hat  wa s a  
terrible thing fo r all 
of us, but in reality, we felt th
at he was lucky t h at he
 di ed then.  Bec ause  he  would never  acc ept  
these _____ of shame.  He did 
not wear the garb of the rebbitz
in, but he was s
till looking like a 
rabbi .  I have a pict ure of hi m I  
ca n s how you lat e r.  You know, w
ith the  big, wi de bea r d.  He wa s a  
mar vel ous person.  Ver y  ope n- minde d, very i ntell igen
t , ve ry s chol arly.  After he di ed we re ceived  
letters from Canada and fr
om Austral i a wher e he had corr espo
nde d with ot her ra bbi s.  He was a  
very scholarl y per son, he  would 
write , he ha d be a uti ful ma nus cript
s and manuscri pts that you ca n 
never re plac e.  And all t hat wa s di sa ppe ared, t oo, 
when the Germans entered. 
 He was starting, in 
the morning, he go
t up at 4 o'clock to study. 
 He was a very affe ctionate
 grandfather, a nd he  ha d a  
great  infl uence on me
.  And he was very open-
minde d.  One morni ng we -- 
my ol dest  sister  and I , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374

we stayed with our grandfather a
nd grandmot her , be cause t h ey were  elde rly a nd t hey wer e al one .  
They only lived two or three bloc
ks from our villa, so ev
ery night we stayed wi
th them.   And in the 
morni ng, he would get up very earl y
 li ke I told you, and we would 
pr epar e the breakfast for us.  And 
one morni ng he said t o us, "I notice d  that you 
ne ver sa y a pr ayer when you eat brea kfa st."  An d 
that 's all he s aid, a nd from that da y on whe n we 
s tarted e ating he went out .  He ne ver s aid it again, 
just to show wh at type
 of pers on he  was. 
Q: What wer e your  pl
ans wh en you were 18 
or 19 years old after 
you fi nished school?  
A: I didn't li ke sc hool , I didn't li ke sc hool at al l.  
I fi nished because I needed 
to fini sh.  But at t hat  
ti me  I did not want t o go 
on, and I  sta r ted t o wor k 
wit h my ol dest si ster wh
o was maki ng ha ts.  She  
had lear ne d t he professi on, and I wa
s horre ndous; I ne ver was able t o 
ma ke  a hat.  I was  ver y bad a t  
it.  Then the war started and we 
had to leave that city
, so the  hat busine ss  
was dead anyway.  But 
then during t he war lat er, I went
 back t o s chool
, nur sing sc hool . 
Q: Is t hat  s o met hing that  ca me t o you later or wa
s it some thing that you we
re  al wa ys i nter ested in?  
A: No , I was  alwa ys inte r e sted .  I wan t ed to be co me
 a lawyer, but then I hated it, you see.  I hated it 
fer oci ously for cert ain r e asons.  
All my sist ers had been fair  stud
ents.  I was not interested in  
studying what they were t
eachi ng me.  I only inter ested
 in the country.  I had 
r ead an awful l ot.  I n  
French lit erature or any l iteratur e when the teacher
 always a s ked us, I ' m s ure nobody of you ha ve  
read it, I had al ways r ead it.  
Or once upon a time I had read the 
book, bec ause  I r ead c onst antl y.  
But t hen I wa s not int e reste d in doi ng my homewor
k a nd doing thes e things.  So I  really hat ed 
school bec a use I  kne w ever y cla
ss t he te acher woul d sa y t o me , " H
ow can you be such a student 
when all  your sist ers are so great  st udents?" 
 You know, and that di
d it , I  hat ed it .   
Q: Let  me a sk you one  que stion be fo
re we  c onti nue .  It 's  a c urious 
thing to me, it 
sounds like you 
had a  ver y st rong J e wis h fa ceti ous nes s.  On th
e ot her ha nd, you had a  lo
t of Catholic friends. 
A: Sure. 

Q: Gr owing up i n Fra nce  and know
i n g wha t  was  starting t o happen
 i n Ge r ma ny, Pol a nd, di d you 
fe el you wer e pr otec ted a s a  Fr enc h 
citizen just like everyone else, or
 di d you fe el separa te as  a  Je w?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374

A: Oh, no.  I felt absolutely like 
a Fr enc h Je w.  At that ti me  I couldn't believe t hat we c oul d be  
treate d equal l y.  Firs t, I never thought  we could lo
se the war.  That was an
other reason.  You know, 
we  were  sur e  we woul d win  th e war .  T he En glis h  
an d us,  we wo uld  win  t he war .  T he  B e lgia ns  an d  
Dutch.  You know, how can
 you even imagine that 
you are going to lose th
e war?  And t hen ther e 
was whole year of -- al most
 not qui te  a ye ar beca use it  start ed 
I thi nk i n J une -- I have troubli n g  
re me mb erin g mo nth s .  But  for  al mo st
 a whole year there was no real
 wa r.  You kn o w,  we wer e  in 
_______ but  not hing wa s  occ urri ng
.  The  __________ li ne was one 
side; the Siegfried was on the 
other side and the y were l ooking at
 each ot her but there was no real 
fighting going on.  So we di dn't  
know what wa s goi ng on.  
And t he n sudde nly it e xpl ode d, s o t h
at 's how the se t hings  oc c urred.   
Q: Why did your fa mily l eave  
Met z a nd wher e did you go?  
A: Oh, okay.  I n '39 just  be fore
 t he war  was declared, about a we
ek before the war -- there was a 
government appealed to all the peop
l e fro m M etz  who c oul d affor d 
to leave, to le
ave because we  
wer e so cl ose to t he bor der.  I  
don't know how much, th
at's 20 miles, 25 mile
s?  I cannot tell yo u  
exactl y, but it 's not much mo re than
 that if I'm mi staken.  And so we
 le ft a nd we we
nt to Pratique,  
because Prat ique was the city wh
ere we were supposed to go.  
And on t o p of it my father ha d a  
brot her in Pratique whic h ma de th
e thing eve n e asier , so we  went to Pra tique .  My two brot hers  
wer e  in the ar my the n.  My ol dest brothe r wa s 
in _________, and 
my younge st brot her ha d be e n  
dra fte d i n Tunisi a.  The war start e
d a nd he s t ayed in Tuni
sia.  So they were go
ne so we, t he girls ,  
and my pare nts and J ac ki e, we  we nt t o Prati que . 
Q: Wh at was the life  like in Pratiq
ue?  Wh at kind of town wa s it? 
A: It  was a complet e di fferent  tow
n.  Metz i n a n i ndustrial  are a, ve
ry industrial.  It 's st eel -- do you 

know steel mines?  A lot of
 foreigners, we had lots 
of ports and Italians were
 -- in the village was a 
whole, not in city Metz, but that
 gave Met z a very -- it was very 
-- I have t o find my word -- 
progressive as a city.  Politicall
y, it was -- Metz was al
ways very extreme ri
ght, okay?  And the 
extreme right, all the newspapers 
of the ext r eme right , and they ha
d t wo, wer e al ways  eating -- we  
had a n expr ession.  We  said th
ey were eati ng Jew at ever y break
fast , you know.  That wa s the 
expr essi on.  That wa s __
______, a nd these type of ne ws pa pe rs. 
 And Pra tique i n the country wa s

very agricultural area, the wh ole area.  No indust
r y  wha t so eve r .   Very bac k wo od s.  For peo ple wh o 
came from an industr i al  area, y
ou know, it 's a big di ffer ence.  But t he peopl e they didn't accept  
imme diately when they didn't know
 you, but the y we re ver y  frie ndl y.  But what happened a fte r  
when we st a r ted to have trouble, t he y  helpe d us 
tr e mendously and it was al wa
ys at the risk of their 
lives .  Beca use nothi ng c oul d be done  wit h the Je ws
 without risking your life
.  You must ha ve hear d 
that by other people.  You know
, whatever little thing 
you would do fo r a Je
w, you were risking 
your li fe i f you were c aught .  And 
all these people risked their lives 
fo r people that they hardly knew  
so meti me s.  But beca
us e they felt it  was whole ,  and they di
dn't even care ab
out the Jews.  You 
know, i n Pr atique, you know, I  ha
ve to go ba c k to 
that.  Metz was the 
third largest Jewish 
communit y i n France before t he war.
  I don't  know now, but  be for e 
t he  war.  Prati que  had thr ee -- I  
think three or fo ur Jewish
 communes; that was all.
  We wer e t here for  a 
l o ng ti me, but most pe ople  
didn't e ven know how a  Je
w looked.  But beca use 
they read certai n papers, they heard cer tai n  
things, they didn't like Je
ws .  But wh en th ey sa w wh
at happened to us, then
 they did not -- I don't 
talk about all of them.  You know, 
but the majority of pe
ople i n Pra tique di d not agre e t his war was  
goi ng, wit h what ha ppe ned t o us  the r e.
  An d that's  why 
it is so hard. 
Q: What is  t he ge neral  
population of Poitiers? 
A: It was about 40,000.  I thin
k 30 - -  20 to 40,000.  
I cannot r e member , but  
it was a small -- much 
smaller town than Metz 
which was 60 or 70,000.  So  it wa s a 
much, much smaller town but a ver y  
old town.  Very, very ol d.  Going 
back to the Middle Ages
, li ke Met z, too.  Metz , t oo, i s a ver y old 
town. 
Q: Comi ng from a reli giou
s background, i f the re wer e
 so fe w Je ws there , c
oul d you ma intain your  
community? 

A: Oh, sure.  Because al l the re
fuge e s fr om Met z  ca me.  So a  whole c o mmunit y, e ve n our r abbis  
whi ch was not any more than -- he
 was Ra bbi Eli  Bloc k 
(ph) who die d -- who 
was i m porte d with 
___________.  And he was ou
r rabbi for the last  t wo or t hree year
s  whe n I  wa s in t he [Luc erne ], he  
became our  teacher because he 
repl aced t he rabbi who 
had died.  For exampl e, he was in the 
Ger ma n Ar my duri ng t he first war ,  
and whe n I  was si x ye a r s old when
 he taught us  the Bi ble , he

aske d who wer e the ba d people at th
e T o wer o f Ba bel.   An d I just l o
oke d  at hi m, I di dn't know he  
was in the Ger man Ar my  at the ti
me , I was six.  And I sai d t o hi
m, " T he Ger ma ns ."  An d whe n I  
came home  and I told my parents,
 they said, "Oh, my 
Go d."   He was  a v e ry 
good fri end of my 
grandfat her .  When he need
ed a week's vacati on, he wo
uld al ways call  that uncl e. 
Q: We 're goi ng to change  the  ta pe. 
A: Okay. 

Q: So now unity was reconstitute
d i n parts  of Eur o pe, s o me wha t ? 
A: Yeah, somewhat .  Not 
quite, but there wa
s quite a fe w people from Metz. 
Q: Was the plan to just  [i naudible
] or what, di d you have plans ?   
A: No, when the war star
ted, you had to wait till you see what is
 going to happen.  You cannot make  
plans under these conditi ons . 
 So my brot hers we nt a way.  M y pa
rents, we tried to survive.  M y  
olde st brot he r ca me  back 
fr om on per mis sion on fu
rlough in wintertime  befo
re t he war started.  And 
he ma de us start a busi ness there , my older sist
e r and I .  And we know
 wa s be yond Egypt .  We  
starte d a bus i ness  to ma ke some  ki nd
 of -- we had to live. 
 We didn't want t o be  on wel f are.  That 's  
somet hing we -- so starte d a busi nes s , and it wa
s _________, you kn
ow.  And we had to start i n  
women's clothing, but that 
was a little latter.  That's after the Jabot
insky came in.  Bu
t we did that to 
start s o met hi ng, to be okay and to be  able t o fee d  
us.  We  wer e  quit e  young. 
 And on t op of it, we 
had Ger ma n y -- and al so Ger many, 
t hat was a lot  of di ffer ence, t o
o.  You know, al
so peopl e when  
they ca me we had to be --  so ev
erybody came, came to our house in 
Bu dapest; it was an open house.  
So we were -- and the n t he war st arte d, a nd t he Ger m
ans first were -- and t her
e wer e refugees i n the  
station all  al ong the st at
i on.  Thousa nds  and t hous
ands a nd thous ands wer e 
kill ed.  There was not a 
place , nothi n g.  And t hey were j ust fl ying over us
 and just thr owi ng bomb s. 
 And befo re we started 
the busi nes s and t he n a ft e r, too, we hel ped t he r e fu
gees.  My si ster and I we
nt -- my sister, St eph -- I 
call he r St eph.  But St ephani e and I,
 we we nt d o wn al way s  t o the st
ati on and hel ped the re fugees .  
An d so we helped a lot of young pe
ople.  And t he r e I ha ve a st ory, whe n the Bis hop ca me t o se e us , 
the Bi shop of Pr atique .  An
d he  gi ve  me  hi s ri ng t o kiss , a nd I  said
, " Sir , I  don't  kis s 
it .  I 'm Je wi sh." 
An d he said, "______.  Y
ou s hould ki ss my ri ng a nywa y."  And 
I sai d I would never do it.  And he

wa s very upset, but I didn't kiss it.
  So, these are the kind
 of t hings for chil dr
en.  Yo u know, I would 
go t o c hurc h and my pare nts didn't mi nd at  all t hat 
I go t o c hur c h.  But I would ne ver -- but we had a  
chur ch acr oss the street, and wh
en it was started, they had a h
uge _______, it was like a _____ t o  
me .  It wa s a  bigger  -- you know, it
 was really extr emely col or ful an
d beauti ful music and all  that .  I  
love d t o go a nd s ee t hat , but I ne ver t hought -- t ha t  
never i n fluence d my thi nki ng.  But i t  isn't -- a nd  
I took, when my chil dre n  were bi gge r , I took the m to
 churc h.  It's an e xperienc e for t he m also a s 
Je ws.  I never -- you know, I never close d my mi nd to that , eve n after the war.  After all what  
happe ned, I cannot be cl ose d- minde d.
  Do not  be onl y -- have one vie w
 of things.  Th
er e is not j ust  
one  vi e w of t hings, it 's a human
 wisdom, that's how I fe el.   
Q: S o what wa s 
this in . . . 
A: That was when the Ger mans start ed to the wa
r, but be fore  the Ger ma n s entere d, se veral da ys  
be for e -- I  cannot t ell you how many
.  Se ver al da ys be fore the  Italia n ca me  on t he a bs olute l y 

de fe nsel ess  city and kill ed t housa nds a nd thous a nds
 of people.  An d there 
we ha d s o met hing ver y 
strange  ha ppene d.  I  ha d just  ca lle
d - - because at that t i me we were
 living in that house on a hill 
above t he st ation, much above t he 
station.  They were 
not hur t bec aus e the st
ation was in a valley, 
and there was a hill on that 
side and then there is a h
ill on that side. 
 It's very hilly. 
 And I had just 
cros sed t he bridge, t he bridge for people.  You know,
 from -- I have to thi
nk -- for people to wal k, 
not for car s, but _________ had j ust
 c r oss ed it , and I was on t he ot her s i de  of the stati o n whe n the  
bomb ardme nt took place.  I was not at
 that time taking care
 of the refu gees that 
da y.  I wa s goi ng to  
the st ore a ft e r lunc h.  And whe n that happe ned, 
I onl y thought  about -- wh
en the bomb ardment was 
over , I  only t hought a bout one t hing,
 t o r un ho me  and  tell  my  mo ther
 I wa s ali ve.  Whi ch she  di dn't 
know where  it wa s, but she  
knew that there was a bombardment.  
So I cr osse d t hat  br idge  back, I  
wa s the onl y one  crossi ng i t
.  And I di dn't t hink a b
out it , a nd t her e wer e trai ns of muniti ons a nd 
there were peopl e fr om t he railr oad, wal kers, who 
wer e maki ng si gns , " D on't cros s.  Don't cros s."  
But I was j u st coming.  I  want ed to
 tell my mother I was 
okay.  That 's all I t
hought, I didn't real iz e  
that I -- or I don't thi nk I realized it.  So I went 
home a nd I tol d my mother , 
but during that time my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374

sister was l o oki ng for me  bec aus e 
she had been somewhere else.  A
nd she wa s -- she  went t o all  the  
hos pital s t o s ee i f  I ha d be en hurt , bec a use  
she didn't find me .  And I wa s home , so . . . 
Q: This  mus t  ha ve  be
en fairly frightening. 
A: Oh, I was  terribly fri g htened of
 the bombardment.  Once they 
were bombardi ng, I was -- I never 
had live d t hr ough one  be fore.  I wa s extre me l y t e rri
fi ed.  I  wa nted to be 
a s maller t hi n g.  I 'm not 
very l arge, but as small 
a s I could.  There wer e ol d pe opl e runn
ing to hous es, a nd I jus t  wis he d the  
whole t o wn -- you know, to hol d me
 i n t heir ar ms.  That  house 
wa sn't de stroye d, but it coul d 
happen.  It wa s very close, but 
just at the beginning 
of the street.  I don't 
reme mb er what street, 
where it was.  And then t here wa
s a second bomb ardment, 
just that I don't re
me mb er wh en .  B ut I  
know t her e was a second bombar dmen
t, and then that was t he end 
of t h at and Ger m any c a me i n. 
But the Italians they were absolutely, you coul d see 
the pilots so low they we
r e fl ying.  Of cours e, 
they ha d not  very sophist i cated pl
anes at that  ti me, and you coul
d see t he bombs  just  comi ng out . 
That  was my  first  ex
peri e nce  with war . 
Q: Di d you e xpe ct t his  at all?  

A: No , n o.  I  was so
 indi gna nt be caus e I fe lt that t hey wer e 
so cowar ds to bombar d
 the city without  
defe nse.  Wh en there were milita
ry people, ammunition in the sta
tion, you know, goi
ng through, but 
there  was  nothing t o de fe nd the  cit y. And t he y knew tha t , the y  wante d 
us to be just  so petrified that  

we accept t h e Ger many Ar my
 when they come i n.  
It was a psychological wa
r fare.  There was no 
reason, no tactical  reason to
 do that .  There  was  not  indus
t r y;  the r e was  nothi ng ther e. 
Q: Do you re me mber  the date?  

A: It was several days before t he German
s  ent ere d.  I  ca nnot t ell you e xact ly when. 
Q: Was if it was li
ke in May 1940? 
A: M ay --  ye ah, May or J une - -  I ca nnot re me mb
er .  Do you know I ca nnot
 re me mb er i f it wa s Ma y  
or June?   But it took about unt il June
 until t he Ger ma ns c a me a s far as 
Bast i lle, beca use t hey went to 
Elgin.  It went fa st
, but still.  Once 
they went -- th
ey never hit the Russians. 
 They were grounded.  
Then they came down sout h where there was no de
fens e.  And t he  Frenc h
 Ar my  and the English 
Ar my were una ble t o fight the m, firs t  beca use t he 
governme nt wa s unbeli evably
 ba d.  It wa s a ve ry, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
12 
 
very cowardly governme nt. 
 And t hen the second reason was t hat 
our  ar my  was not  trai ned for  that. 
They were thinking that it was a 
war like in 1914, '18 and not for 
1940.  And De  Ga
ulle had told 
them what t hey should 
do, but they never liste ne d to anythi ng -- they know this.  Do you know hi s  
book was read by Hitler, and he us
ed it?  But see, the 
French didn't know.  Th
ey were never very 
good -- how do you call  t hat
?   I n your  own c ountr y, you are  
recognized for  what you are. 
Q: So des cri be t o me  when t he  Ge
r mans came i n, what
 t hat  was like. 
A: I was wal king the stre ets wit h 
my older si ster , Siss ie, a nd we s o
rt of fe lt Ger ma ns , what do you  
say, we just felt them coming.  And 
I told my sister, "I wish I could k
ill them."  And at that time -- at 
that mo ment in ti
me, they didn't get killed bu
t they fe ll, and I couldn't be
lieve it.  I said, "Did I do 
it? "  I didn't  do it.  It just happe ned, a coinci den
ce.  But that was my fi rs
t Ger ma n I sa w.  In the  
begi nni ng it wa s horri ble .   You know, I have t o e x
perie nce  s o met hing.  Y
ou know, before t he war I 
was very idealistic.  I was an abso
l ut e  paci fi st.  I  only t hink war 
c annot do a nyt hing for us .  War  
cannot help anybody, what I thou
ght at that time.  But when I 
saw t he Ger ma ns ' pi cture in t he  
Cha mps Él ysées in Pari s, you know, 
para ding, tha t  is when it j ust to
ok a hold at last .  And from t hat 
day on, I thi nk we have to get out
.  But i n the beginning I c oul dn't
 do a nyt hing muc h.  But i n the  
very be ginni ng when the Ger ma ns , t h
ey wer e very polit e.  They were
 ext r emel y --  in Fr ance.  They  
did not be ha ve that wa y i n Poland
 or Russia or wherever or Czecho
sl ova ki a, but in Fr a nce they had 
order s a nd t hey were e xt r e mely pol it
e.  And t hey wer e even
 c ourte ous, and the y had r ules .  So t he y 
did not bot h er us t he firs t fe w mont hs, but we di dn'
t pres s the m.  We kne w that the y c oul d not sta y  
like that forever.  
But we didn't know 
what would happen, 
we were just waitin
g.  And then my 
brot her who wa s in Majdane k, he wa
s in pris on.  He wa s a pri soner
 of the Germans 
in Majdanek.  
An d his cousin, too, fr om ________
_.  He was able to escape fr om
 the r e, and he walke d through 
Als ace , it was wi nterti me.  And he 
wa s ma de pr isoner in  June or 
Ma y --  I don't  re me mber, but he  
was a prisoner until ab
out December.  And then in
 December he was able to
 escape, and he crossed  
over there by fo ot because he had 
no way of going. 
 He had civilian clothes,
 but he had no papers . 
All his military papers would show
 that he was a POW.   And then
 he arrived fi nally in Alsace, 
where he ha d a business  -- he ha d 
a very good business t here .  So he
 told all his clients, he calle d

the m a nd t ol d the m he was there a nd he s old ever
ythi ng.  He had a me n's fa
shi on stor e .  You know,  
they had all cust om- made co
st ume s.  The y ma de s uits a nd t hings lik
e that.  So he s old e veryt hing he  
had in hi s st ore --  s o we  got some
 mo ney, we  lived on th
at .  He is  the  one who r eall y helpe d t o hol d 
toget her _______  and he  ca me to 
Pra tique fi nall y.  Aft er Helsi nger ,
 he was able to take a train an d 
he ca me t o Prati que , a n d he st aye d a mont h in Pr
ati que wit h us a nd he met my sis t e r-in-la w who 
wa s my best  frie nd.  And they got 
i n l ove , first ti me.  Fir st ni ght. 
 And we kne w that could be very 
serious.  Th en he
 tried t o escape wit h a co
usi n wh o was  Ger m an,  who  was  livin g wit h u s, t oo .  Th ey  
wer e caught by a Ger ma n  patr
ol when they tried to 
cross i nto French Vi chy.
  Beca use my brot her 's  
plan wa s to go to Vic hy, Fra nce . 
 Go to Spain a nd go to
 _________.  But he wa
s caught  then a nd he 
was in prison fo r months.  But 
the Germans were -- that
 was still at the ti
me  when the German s 
wer e not na sty yet .  They di d not - -  they looke d
 at thes e peopl e, but di d not s ee that he was a  
prisoner of war .  Bec aus e if he wa s not a pris one
r  of war , he 'd be dea d.  But there wa s no pe opl e 's  
orga niza tion, so t hey should have 
understood.  Luckily fo
r hi m, the y did not see , they ne ver notic ed  
that Oscar was a German citizen.  
So they both were months in pr
ison and then they came out. 
The n they went ba ck a ga i n.  The y esc ape d agai n. 
 And the way they escape
d is how the same place  
where t hey escaped at a l ater ti me
.  But they escaped, th
en my sister -in-l aw mu

in-la w, she we nt with he r

that she ha d to __

they got mar ried.  The y ne ver  we nt t o

Q: We 'll talk about that later. 
A: Right.  But I co me bac k to Bat i k, so my ol

A: I m me diat ely, i m me di ately.  As s oon a s the g

staye d __________, our st
ore with clothe s that the Germans cam
e i n '41, begi nni ng '41.  I cannot  
re me mb er th e ti me .  A nd  so w e  
had not hing, not hing -- 
no income anymore. 
 But my brot her w a s  
helpi ng us .  He gave us a ll the mone
y we nee ded t o live on.  And I star
ted to work in the city hall, in  
a Fr ench offi ce of dealing wit h t he Ger mans.  You kno
w, they gave us all the 
requisitions, what they 
wa nt fr om us and we ha d to deli
ver.  And I was  one in t hat depa
rt me nt, that Fre nch office whic h  
dealt  with the Ger ma ns  c onst antl y. 
Q: You spoke German? 

A: Oh, I s pe ak fluentl y.  In Me
t z, we al ways spoke Ge r man and 
Fre nc h.  My parent s unti l  1918 ,  
people had no right to sp
eak French.  My fat her was arrested by
 the  Ger ma ns in 1917 or '1 8 a nd put  
in pri son for a few days 
because t hey said, " Your ne
ighbor sai d that you have
 spoken Fr ench."  The 
poor man di dn't even 
know what was French.  So he was in 
pri son but he was rele
ased because t hey  
underst ood t hat he  di dn't
 speak any Fr ench, so he
 c oul dn't have done it . 
Q: No w,  wh en yo u we re wo rki ng  in  t his 
office, did they know
 you wer e J e wis h?  
A: Oh, no.  The Ger ma n s?   No, th
ey didn't know it.  Th
e y ne ver aske d.  That wa s be for e they wer e 
all -- you know, t he yell ow star  a nd all that, t hat  
wa s be for e.  I worked the r e se veral  mont hs a nd it  
was friendly because the Germans we
re telling me that I was a real
 German, and I was fr om Metz 
and I ha d the  Ger ma n na me .  And I 
wa s ver y bl onde wit h light eyes 
a nd l i ght s kin, s o they t hink I ' m 
a real Ger man.  And they fel t  that
 I s h oul d come t o  Ger ma ny, s o th
ey offe red me jo
bs, you know, in 
governme nt in Ger ma n y if I wante d to.  And I sai d 
no, and I t old some of the m t hat I wa s Je wish . 

And two or three of them, when I told them I am
 Jewish, they didn't  car e.
  But only two of them,  
and t he n I lost my j ob.  You know, be caus e the 
governme nt di d not acc ept 
any more -- t he Germans  
did not accept any more of the Je
ws at work.  But we still didn't 
wear the yellow star, but much 
earlier  -- I  don't reme mber when eith
er, but  much earlier --  
they had an edict that
 all Jewish fathers 
had to come and declare the whole fa
mily.  If not, we would be killed.  So my father like all father s 
we nt t o decl are his own fa mi ly.  It was prete ntious
 not t o for hi m, and we 
ne ver  dis cussed it eve n .  
He j ust we nt  beca use he felt he ha
d t o do it , and who was to t hink that
 we would be kill ed?   So that 's  
ho w it seems, so we were declar
ed but we  ha d no st ar yet.

Q: So what sort of re
strict ions were t h ere? 
A: Oh, t he re strictions on Je ws st arted aft er the war  starte
d with the Russians.  Th
en is when it really 
starte d.  You know, sa y where the re strictions -- I  
cannot re me mber, but re al restricti ons, the yell ow  
star and all that, really st arted 
after the war started with the Russi
an s.  B e ca use whe n I wa s wo rki ng  
at that French office at t h e city hall, I know I 
was not wearing the yellow st
ar.  An d I know that, you 
know, that I  re me mber .  All that ha ppe ne d after , 
so I know that these th
ings occurre d.  And the  
Russian -- the war with the Russians 
started at that time , when I was 
in tha t  office .  So I know that  
ever ythi ng st arted with that
.  That  muc h, I a m s ure . 
Q: S o t hat  was 
June of '4 5? 
A: Yeah, I c annot - - do
 you know I ha ve tr oubl
e  re me mb eri ng  dates?   
But anyway 
then . . . 
Q: So up until this time
 there was no restriction 
on your mo veme nts or anyt
hing you wa nted to do?  
A: No.  That  starte d onc e  we  ha d t h
e yellow star a nd a
ll that.  But  the y had clos ed our  s t ore li ke t he y 
did be for e.  Bec ause I went to t he --  that they 
had cl ose d the store alrea dy.  Beca us e we ha d to  
declar e what  was a Jewish st ore.  
Tha t  the y had done  alre ady beca us
e if not, I woul
d not have been 
worki ng i n the offi ce.  So I know that that had al
r eady occ urre d.  But e ve n then we we r e helped by  
so ma ny people who came 
to us and said, "You
 ca n hide  your  s t uff i n our  
homes."  And they gave it  
bac k, they gave it back a f
ter the war.  And the girl
s transported some suitcases
 with wha t  we had i n  
the store, you know.  Be cause it 
took many -- and the funny thing wa
s one of the Germans helped us 
carry the sui t cases.  Because t hey fel t , "Oh, Mädche
n, you can't carr y that  suitcase.  It 's too heav y 
for you."   So the y hel ped us.

One of my younger sister s wa s ju
st a little  girl wa s arr ested by a 
Ger ma n wit h the SS, a n d he brought  her home .  An
d h e  sai d to my mo the r
, "I f I fi nd her once mor e  
wit hout the s t ar attac he d," -- not sa fet y pi n, but , 
you know, how do you call 
it?  I cannot remember 
the word i n Englis h.  You know, 
one  goe s i nto t h e ot her?   We ll, 
do you know you se w one on top 
and one underneath and 
you put them . . . 
Q: S nap?  
A: A s nap, yea h.  She  had put  s n

 eve r y da y a nd the n we  ha d t o

So he told my mother if she had snaps 
one more time, "I kill her.
"  But luckily [i naudible]
 , so he brought her ho
me.  And she was 14, 13, 
something like that .  But at that 
ti me they di d not  arrest  Ger ma ns. 
 They arr ested what t hey call ed 
the poor ______ , which that was just
, you know, that was just  a joke.  It was the Fr enc h wer e ne xt. 
But onc e the populati on can see , i f onl y that 's ____

they st opped the French, too, after.
  So I lost my job in the city

Q: You were starting to tell me  
about some of the restrictions 
there were on Jewish people.  I 
don't know i f there were any restrict
ions on French people,  but . . . 
A: Not the same .  There were restrictions. For example, there was -- how do you -- oh, I cannot 
find the word.  Do you know at a certain hour of th
e night you had to be in.  Strange because I 
know these words, but I cannot reme mber it.  
But anyway, for us the restrictions were 
unbelievable, and they changed every day.  They
 added some  e very day.  I told you we had no 
right to go into a store before 4 o'clock.  4:00 
or 4:30, I don't reme mber exactly, but about that 
time.  And a t  that time, there was nothing left
 because everybody had coupons to buy everything.  
You couldn't buy things freely; th
ere was nothing to be had free
ly, even milk or butter or 
whatever.  Eggs, you had to have coupons for ever
ything.  So -- but we were very lucky because 
my mother was very liked by all the people where 
she brought things for the family.  And they 
told her not to worry, all of them tol d her not 
to worry.  That any time she wants something, to 
let them know and they will have things ready for 
her, put her away for her for after 4 o'clock.  
So we never mi ssed anything.  We  were never --
 we always had enough food.  Like also other 
French; there was not too much, but we had as mu
ch as all the other Fr
ench people.  We had 
never mi ssed, and then they were also restric
tion you had no right to ha
ve a radio.  You had no 
right to have a telephone.  You could not use a pu
blic telephone.  You couldn't go into any public 
space like the Post Office.  You had no right -- 
the wife of the Rabbi Eli Bl ock I me ntioned 
before, she went into the Post Office and ma ke a 
phone call.  And she was ar
rested with her little 
girl and taken to the Gestapo, and 
the rabbi went and tried to -- he
 always discussed things with 
the Germans.  He was an organizer, and he spoke
 German very well, too.  So he always talked 
with the community, but there he talked for his wi
fe and child.  So they arrested him, too.  But 
that was after we left.  Before we left, hewas still around, okay.  And he had organized -- the 

children were in the camp.  There was a camp in Ba
tik, the outskirt s of Batik, that the children in 
the camp can get out and be kept by a fa mily, 
you know.  So he had a little boy, too:  Padova 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
18 
 
(ph).  I cannot reme mber his first name , but his last name  was Padova.  And his parents were 
deported, and he stayed with us.  But at night the 
rabbi had a place where they
 all -- all these kids 
were sleeping.  They were in our house in da
ytime; they came  home from school, came to our 
house.  We  fed them and we did their home work w
ith them.  We took care of them like a child of 
our fa mily, and when Padova, the little boy, he wa
s about 11 -- when he no
ticed that we were 
going to leave, when he heard that, he begged us to
 take him with us.  And we went to the rabbi 
and told him everything.  What should we do?   
And he said, "You cannot take him with you.  If 
you take Padova, all the children will be arrest ed
."  We still were at that time following the 
orders because we thought -- wenever thought that they were all 
going to be killed anyway, so 
what's  the difference?   You know, at least you've
 saved one.  But we didn't understand that, we 
had no idea what was.  We knew it was bad, but we
 never imagined how bad it was at the time.  
It was impossible to imagine that.  Until the e
nd of the war, we never knew what was going on, 
even if my own sister was deported.  We never kne
w.  So that was -- but before Padova, the story 
of Padova that was just when we left.  Before th
at my sister was arrested at home at dinnertime 
because she had done things for the undergr
ound, but personally we never belonged to the 

underground.  We  never belonged to Reseau, what
 we call it, Reseau.  That means a group of 
underground.  But we did a lot of things.  For 
example, we didn't even know where they came 
from, but people would ring our bell and say, "W
e know that you -- we have heard that you can 
help us cross the water."  So we helped them 
cross the water by sending them to a far mer where 
my brother had crossed the second time , my two 
brothers had crossed and successfully.  That 
far mer in -- I don't reme mber the village where he
 was, but that farmer had a farm which was 
ascribed both lines.  You know, you could go on his la
nd you went on both sides, so it was a very 
good way to cross.  I even crossed there in '41, 
I crossed there to go to see my brother in -- no, 
not in Arlise.  St. Marie De Mare (ph).  They
 were just ma rried and my sis t er-in-law was 
pregnant, and I went to see them for the summer
.  Do you realize that we lived as norma lly as 
possible, we did not let these Germans stop us fro
m walking on.  That was after I lost my job.  I 
think it was after I lost my job in the city hall,
 and I had not registered. 
 I had not started nursing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
19 
 
school yet.  So that's when that ha ppened, so that was in '41.  And yeah, because my nephew was 
born in February '42, so -- I've got reme mber where I was. 

Q: We ll, question:  Whe n you got help from th
ese farmers who let people get across, did you 

have to pay them anything? 

A: No, no.  Nothing, they didn't accept any mone y.  
These people did it just to be he lpful.  And 
that happened, one of the personsmy sister helped, I helped her -- we were both doing it.  But we 

helped one pe rson cross, and that pe rson had for
gotten in our house his tobacco card, which was 

valuable, very valuable for bartering.  Because
 if you didn't smoke, then you could ba rter it for 
other things.  Food, for other thi
ngs.  So he wrote to us and as
ked him to send him the card, and 
my sister sent him the card through the farmer. 
 We couldn't communicate with France -- okay, 
unoccupied France directly, but we 
sent that to the farmer who se
nt it on the other side in a 
ma ilbox to the south of France.  And that letter 
was caught, and she did a terrible mi stake.  We  
never understood, she signed her real name  whic
h we never did.  We  kne w as much, that you 
never signed a letter.  And why 
did she do it that day?   We  don't 
know, but she signed
 the letter.  
And during the day, the day she was arrested, the 
farmer's son, one farmer 's  son came  to the 
house from his farm whi ch was perhaps 12 kilometers from Poitiers, I don't know e xactly, by 

bicycle, to warn us that a German had gotten that letter, had arre sted his father and his oldest 

brother and were questioning them.  And his fa
ther didn't know who Stephanie Hoffnung, so we 
knew that, so we didn't even think that she should
 escape.  You know, she stayed there.  And at 
night at dinnertime , because every night, that 
was another restriction -- every night after 
sundown, the Germans would come  and ma ke a n appeal
 to see if we were a
ll present.  To ma ke 
sure we are there every night, the SS.  And th
at night an SS we had never seen before, a 
_______, which means a noncommi ssioned officer, a ho
rrible looking guy.  He was very taller 
than I, horrible.  He came with two other guys, 
two other SS and they arrested my sister.  We  
were eating, you know.  And Jackie 
was at the table.  We  wer e  eat
ing cherries, we were at the 
dessert; we were eating cherries.  And Jackie to
ok out -- he was about four
, five at the most, I 
don't re me mber what age exactly.  About five at th
e most, he took out the pits and threw them at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
20 
 
the Germans, and I looked at him.  And in front of
 the Germa ns, I said to him in French, I said, 
"Jackie, a Frenchma n is always polite.  Never doubt th
at."  I was afraid they 
kill that kid.  So he 
didn't do it anymore, but the Germans didn't do a
nything against him.  But they arrested my 
sister, they were satisfied with
 that.  They took her away, and 
then about two hours later, they 
came back and arrest ed my father.  But they releas
ed him several hours later, and my  father tried 
to help my sister but there was 
nothing he could do.  They wanted
 her to tell them that she had 
written to that farmer, because that farmer wa
s helping people cross and she said she doesn't  
know anything about it.  She cannot 
tell them, she maintained that.  
And they told her that she's 
fresh, and they told my father that they keep he
r because he raised her 
bad and she's fresh.  And 
that's what killed her, because she would abso
lutely not say anything against the farmer.  She 
would have died before she did.  She died because
 of it.  And the farmer was released because 

they had no proof.  So she was kept in pris
on for one month.  She became 21 in prison in 
Pratique on the 10th of July she became 21.  And 
then she was deported to -- she was moved to -
- no, she was first in a camp in 
Poitiers, in the outskirts of Poit
iers there was a camp.  And she 
was in that camp, and that's why we escaped b
ecause we hoped that she could escape, too.  We  
had arranged help that she could escape because
 until then, she had several time s the opportunity 
to escape.  And she wouldn't because she was or ganizing everythi ng of the camp.  In prison, too, 

she had been a leader.  Prisoners
 who were not Jewish came to s
ee us after they were released, 
political prisoners.  And they told us what a gr
eat leader she is and how she kept morale of 
everybody up, and that she, you know, organized the pr
ison, how to behave in prison.  How to do 
everything.  And she did the same , she was the most 
educated in that camp, as much a s  I can tell 
and she took over the whole organi zation.  And she told us, because we ha ve the guard who we 

knew very well.  He was one of the kids who 
had walked with us to the station.  You know, 
when we helped the refugees.  And we were ver
y, very friendly, and he accepted he r to ma ke her 
escape, but she said she couldn't do that because
 of the people would be killed.  The Germans 
always told them if they tried to escape, they
 would kill he r.  But the guards were French, the 

Germans came in only every morning.  But at night there was no guard -- no German, so the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
21 
 
French guard wanted to ma ke her escape and he woul
d have escaped with her,
 not to be arrested.  
But she refused them, but later she understood what
 mi stake it was.  But then I had organized 
everything; she was a medical student
.  I was a nurse, a student nurse in that hospital.  My fiancé 
was a me dical student, and her boyfriend was a me di
cal student, all in that
 same  university.  And 
all my classmates were ready to help, everybody help
ed us there.  First, when I was accepted in 
that school, nobody -- when I told them, you know, I'
m Jewish, they said, "Who cares?  That has 
no meaning for us."  You know, the French ad
mi nistration, the directors of the school, the 
picture I showed you earlier of my 
classmates, the directors of th
e school and our instructor in 
that picture, too.  And they said, "We couldn't 
care less.  You are French person.  You want to 
come in nursing school, you come in nursing sc
hool."  And they accepted me , and I was 
protected there.  When Germans came to arrest 
patients, it was Catholic
 nuns who directed the 
transport.  The school wa s a Red Cross school, 
which was separate.  But we all, you know, did 
all our work, practical work in th
e hospital, and the hospital of th
e university was by then at that 
time completely run by the Cat
holic nuns.  And the Catholic 
nuns would be warned if the 
Germans we re arriving and they hid me , so that 
they don't see me .  Beca use the director of the 
hospital said to me , "You are not 
going to wear the yellow star in 
the hospital.  I don't want to see 
it."  And I didn't wear it, but they knew that they
 would arrest me  because I don't wear it.  That 
was already the best punishme nt, just for that.  So
 they hid me  every time  that the Germans ca me  
to arrest people, take them to the stations in
 the barracks.  You know, old people, young people, 
whatever they -- whoever they want
ed, not just Jews but whoever they
 felt they should arrest.  It 
was enough that some body tell them it's a Communist
, even if it was absolutely not true, then 
they would arrest.  But my sister
 then she -- we had arranged, I had 
seen one of the doctors at the 
hospital.  And we had arranged that she wasn't  
feeling well, she had a kidney problem, a serious 
kidney problem and he knew that.  So I had discusse
d that with him, and he agreed that if she is 
comi ng to the hospital the morning we were esca
ping, then he would trea
t -- the hospital and 
then he didn't  know anything else, but all my 
classmates, her boyfriend -- my fiancé said -- as 
soon she arrives in the ho
spital, they get her out 
and get her across the borde
r.  But unfortunately, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
22 
 
the morning she was supposed to be there, she 
was supposed to go to the hospital, the little SS 
came.  And when he -- you Ametz appealed to her to stand there for hours.  He -- seven people 
were on the side to go to the hospital, and he 
said to them, "Nobody goes to the hospital."  That 
was a combi nation, because after that they knew 
we had gone, so then she had no mor e  chance.  
So that was it.  So fr om the camp of Poitiers, she was later sent to Drancy, and fr om Drancy she 

was sent to Pithiviers, which is between Pari
s and Orleans.  And fr
om Pithiviers, she was 
deported on the day of Yom Kippur, 8-42 to Ausc
hwitz.  And we know she went to Auschwitz 
because I have the book saying that he r convoy went
 to Auschwitz in three days.  And we got 
cards; after the war was finishe
d, her boyfriend had received a car
d that she had smuggl ed out on 
the day of Yom Kippur.  It was a nurse of the camp, and the card said she couldn't write to us.  

But she wrote to him, and he was in Poitiers.  A
nd she -- which isn't very far fr om Pithiviers, and 
that card -- he gave me  that card when he me t me  after the war.  And inthat card, she told that 

they are leaving, the morale excellent.  They
 prayed and fasted all day on Yom Kippur ; they 
didn't know how much fastingthey
 would do afterwards.  And sh
e was deported that day.  She 
wrote to us that she would try by all means, we 
had the code to make lit
tle points on those certain 
letters.  The Germans, if they had found the card
 with that, would have 
absolutely known what 
the code means.  They would have broken the code in no time , but she wrote, "I will sabotage 

my work as much as I can."  She didn't  realize, we didn't know what was going on.  It was 

unbelievable.  But anyway, she was deported, but in 
between we decided to leave so that she can 
escape.  And because that things were getting worse and worse, so we knew it was time.  It was 

right after I was a graduate of the first year of
 nursing, and all my cla
ssmates helped.  Everybody 
helped.  My fiance helped.  The neighbors helpe
d, they came and took our belongings out of the 
house with their bicycles.  We  got everything back
 after the war, but one family didn't -- was not 
honest.  But, otherwise, they all would give us 
back everything we left.  You know, all that was 
risking their lives, and the night be
fore we left -- oh, I have first to talk about some thing else.  
Several weeks earlier, a ma n I had worked with at
 the city hall, I knew him but not very much.  

His name is Albert Charpentier, C-h-a-r-p-e-n-t-i
-e-r, and hi s wife, I have paper here telling me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
23 
 
the name  of his wife who died, too, now.  And not-- his son, but I can show you the paper later.  
And it said Mr. Charpentier came to the house and to
ld me -- because he knew me -- and said, "I 
know that you need peoples without those damn Jews."  Because on top of it, all of our identity 

cards had the stamp Jew.  So he said, "I have
 to" -- "I can give you car
ds for everybody in your 
fa mily."  And I asked him how much it would 
cost, and his response was to say, "How can you 
ask me  how much it can cost?   Such a thing, you 
don't pay for .  I do it because that's what I 
believe in."  And he was a poor ma
n, he was not a rich ma n at all at
 that time.  And he  did it, he 
gave us cards and that's why we could escape.  Because as long we had the Jew stamped, we 

could not wa lk anywhere, couldn't go out of the c
ity.  So he saved the life of my whole family, 
and for -- he didn't -- but I have to say that.  I 
forgot.  That Mr. Charpe
ntier since he was very 
young had worked for one of the three or four Jewi
sh fa milies who lived in Poitiers for a long 
time and had a store.  And he was there, and 
he loved them because they had always been 

extremely nice to him.  And he told me  how I w
ill never forget what the Forshan (ph) , that 's the 
name  of the Jewish family, who survived.  They were not deported.  Wh at's -- undoubtedly, he 

did cards for them, too.  Never asked, but the Fors
han, I'll never forget what they did for me  and 
my fa mily and what I can do for Jews, you're a
ll French and I will do that for you peoples.  I 
want you to be safe.  I cannot accept that that wi
ll be.  And that's  what we heard.  You know, 
when we wa lked in the street wh
en we start to wear the st ar, 
old men -- very proper old men, you 
know, because they used to love 
the little nobility in Poitiers. 
 I told you it's a very backwoods 
country, very right wing.  They would cross thestreet towards us to come  on your side.  They 

salute us and say, "We do not agree."  Constantl
y, it was not just an accident; it was constant .  
Not everybody did, but it happened many, ma ny, ma ny ti
mes.  They would come to my mother 
who spoke no -- very little French, because in Metz
 my parents were raised in Germany.  They 
were not raised -- they spoke beautiful German. 
 That's why we all spoke German, and with my 
parents we never spoke Fr ench.  We  spoke Ge
rma n, but sisters and brothers, we all spoke 

French.  We  never spoke German and we ne
ver do.  But at table we would go from one 

language, and my parents understood what we were
 saying.  For a long time  we didn't know that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
24 
 
and we thought we can say things we shouldn't.  A
nd then when they would discover what that's  
about, but that was when we were teenagers. 
 But my parents spoke French, they understood it 
but they spoke comi cally.  It was not what it should have been because they learned it when they 

were adults and they never went to school.  My 
mother was very educated in German, but not in 

French.  My father was not very 
educated, he knew how to read and write and more than that, but 

he was not educated like my mother.  He di
dn't come from the same background, so it was a 
different -- and he had lost his mother when 
he was three years old.  So it was a compl e te 
different way of life.  But I come  back to Poitiers.  The night before we . . . 

Q: Actually, before you move on, ma
y I ask you a couple of questions? 
A: Sure. 

Q: You me ntioned that the German
s would come  in and arrest people.  Wa s this a common thing 

on the streets and in businesses that there were 
a lot of arrests or de
portations in Poitiers? 
A: They did not do it so much in th
e streets.  They arrested people, yes.  They arrested people in 
the streets, but they always tr
ied in the streets at the beginni
ng, the very beginning, to ma ke it 
very quiet, peaceful.  But in the houses, they cam
e at night when nobody had the right to be in 
the street.  You know, after curfew.  That's  the word I was looking for.  After curfew.  So people 

were not in the streets, they didn't know.  Bu
t when my sister was arrested, I don't know it 
happened, all my friends knew it in a few mi nutes a
nd several came with their bi cycles at the risk 
of their lives, because it was curfew, to see w
ho was arrest ed.  They knew one of the girls, 
Hoffnung, was arrested, but they didn't  know which. But anyway, they wanted to express their, 

you know, their sympathy and help us if they co
uld.  And I had one good friend in my class who 
liked me  a lot, and she came  and just embraced me  and said, "Oh, my God, I'm so happy.  I was 

afraid it was you."  And I almost killed her, I was so ma d.  I s a id, "How can you say that when 

it's my own sister who got arrested? "
  I was so horrified that she sa
id that, and she felt terrible but 
she said, "Don't you realize that
 I know you, I don't know her much
? "   But I felt that it was 
atrocious, what she said.  So this type of things happen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
25 
 
Q: So you were trying to live as norma l a life as po
ssible, but clearly this wasn't  very norma l.  
Did you feel safe? 
A: No, we didn't feel safe, but that 's why we escaped.  Mostly, we felt unsafe until my sister  was 

arrested, because we wanted her to be able to get 
out of there.  I went to
 that -- my mother asked 
me  constantly to go and see that little Hipp, was 
the filthy SS, his name  wa s H-i-p-p.  And to see 
him and try to convince him to get 
my sister out and I tried, but he 
told me the last time  I talked 
to him -- it was in the street because when I went
 to the office of the SS, he wouldn't even accept 

to see me .  But in the street I me t him and I went
 to him, and he said, "Mädchen, if you come  one  

pace closer to me , I have you arrested."  So what c
ould I do?   It was no help if I got arrested.  My 
fa mily needed me , too.  So I would have traded w
ith my sister with pleasure, but I could not be 

arrest ed on top of her because what would have 
happened to my family then?  I organized the 
whole departure from
 Poitiers then.   
Q: We 've got to change the tape. 

A: What? 

Q: Change the tape . . . 

Q: Could I just before we start -- oh, yeah, 
I know.  I was asking her a couple of questions. 
A: About Poitiers before we left. 

Q: Correct.  Before you leave? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Just, by the way, did you -- when
 your sister was arre
sted and she was a prisoner, then she 
was in Pithiviers? 

A: First in the camp and then to Drancy and Pithiviers. 

Q: Did you have any communication 
with her during this period? 
A: In Poitiers?   In prison we couldn't see her,
 they wouldn't let us, but when she went to the 

camp, we could visit her in the camp and we di
d visit her in the camp.  It was all day, it was 
ma nned by t he French, and at night -- only in the 
morning did the Germans come  to make appell 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
26 
 
and give all the bad orders and, you know, do all the 
stupid things they had to do, they wanted to 
do. 
Q: What was the name  of that camp?  Did it have a name ?  

A: I don't reme mber a name.  We called it Cote de 
Poitiers (ph) .  I don't know
 if that's the na me ; 
my brother told me  some thing and I forgot. 

Q: What was it like from your . . . 

A: It was, you know, like a camp.  It was with ba
rbed wire and entrance, but it was only French 
people.  Wh en we had the right to
 visit, there were only French 
guards, and they were not nasty 
to the camp -- to the people in the camp. 

Q: The conditions weren't bad? 

A: How can conditions be good in a camp?   We  
brought the food.  We  had the right to bring 
food.  There were cousins there, too, you know.  
Cousins of my mother.  One cousin of my 
mother was in that camp, too.  And I tell you, 
when we talked to her, she always had the 
ma rvelous morale.  Or at least she ma de believe
 she had a ma rvelous morale.  She always said 
things are good, "I am going to get this done."  She always talked about doing the most harm to 

the Germans she can do.  That's all she had in mi nd. 

Q: You talked a little bit about help
ing people get to th
e unoccupied France. 
A: Right. 

Q: Do you have any sense of -- that mostly wa
s just showing them where to go and where to 
cross? 

A: No, no.  We sent them, we didn't  show them.  
We didn't take them there, but we gave them -- 
not a ma p, but we explained to them how to go ther
e, and we got in touch 
always with the farmer 
and told hi m they'r e coming.  They couldn't, he wouldn't have accept to just take people without 

knowing who they are.  But if they 
were recomme nded by us, he would do it. 

Q: How ma ny people do you think you helped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
27 
 
A: I don't know exactly, I cannot remember.  Perh
aps 10.  Then my whole fa mily, but not the 
same place.  Because after my sister was arre
st ed, that farm was -- that was not anymore 
________, I don't know i f that's English. 
Q: One other question before you continue:  I'm cu
rious what the French attitude was toward the 
Vichy governme nt? 

A: Oh, that's very important.  In the very
 beginning, very beginni
ng, Vichy -- Pétain was 
considered like a god.  You know, he was a hero of
 first world war.  I cannot stand him, and I 
know why he was a hero.  His ma in reason to be a he
ro is because there we re riots in the trenches 
and he had the people shot.  You know, the peopl
e rioting, the people who were rioting in the 
trenches for so ma ny yea r s.  And instead of trying
 to ma ke life easier, he just had shot certain 
number of them, and that riot wa
s over, okay?   He became a hero due to that; that's not a hero for 
me  as a general.  He was not as specific -- Jaffa a
nd Frisch were not better 
generals than he was.  
But I talk about name s that people in America don't know much about.  These were our big 

generals for World Wa r I, but Pétain had a 
reputation.  And, you know, onc
e people believe in a 

ma n, they think he cannot do anything wrong.  So
 in the beginning, he confused ma ny, ma ny 
French people who thought that they had to 
go along with Pétain.  But slowly, slowly people 
start to understand, mostly when the Germans be ha
ved like that in occupied France, how horrible 
that was.  And in unoccupied France, and then 
anyway, in '4 2 I think November if I reme mber, 

once were in unoccupied France, once the Ameri cans landed in North Africa, all France was 

occupied, even the South of France.  Everything 
was occupied by the Germans, but they never, 
never were able to ma ke the same  orders in the 
north.  We  had identity cards for Jews.  I didn't 
and my fami ly didn't anymore because we had change
d our cards.  But I think that that's what is 
ahead, I cannot even -- I am not even sure that
 they have to stamp Jew, but I think.  But nobody, 
nobody ever wore a yellow star in the South of Fr
ance.  Even after the Germans were there, 
nobody.  We were not deprived of going in stores. 
 We  had nothing of this type of restrictions, 
but the Jews were arrested.  And some elements
 in the police helped the Germans because of 
Vichy, because Vichy gave them the orders a
nd they were the bosses.  And, you know, when you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
28 
 
are some body who's under these type of bosses, ma
ny peopl e do what they are told to do even if 
they don't completely agree.  Now, there were 
ma ny who did not agree and helped the Jews and 
the other people.  There were not only Jews that
 were arrested in the South of France.  The 
regular citizens were arrested, t
oo.  But anyway, that's  another 
question.  But the country [tape 
skipped] . . . 

Q: Until? 

A: Until they started to believe  in the De Gaulle.  You know, De Gaulle sa ved us.  By going to 

England and by ma king that ma rvelous speech.  
By ma king that ma rvelous speech, you know.  

"France has lost the battle, but ha
s not lost the war," some thing lik
e that.  I cannot repeat word by 
word.  Some thing that is -- and after that, the 
Fr ench started to thi
nk.  And then when the 
Germans were starting to have covered Russia, they became much worse with the whole French 

population, then a lot of French people started to
 convert completely and 
forget about Vichy and 
not want to have anything to do with the pope. 
 You know, and help the 
other side, but it took a 
little while.  Because it's so difficult when 
some body you believe in takes a command and says 

that's the right thing.  You know, in every country
 you will have that.  Even now here, if Clinton 

says some thing about -- let's see, about a bomb 
having exploded by terrorists, in the beginning 
everybody would follow hi m.  And then slowly so
me  people would criticize him if he goes too 
far and gives too ma ny plastic orders.  You know, 
that's what you have to see how things go in 
context.  It's very complicated.  But, for 
example, the class I was in called ___________.  And I 
told my classmates I don't believe in _________, but
 they were horrified.  "How can you not 
believe  in ___________?"  I was the only Jewish student there, and they accepted me  very well.  

But at the same time, they said, "How -- it's so di ffi
cult to be a nurse.  To take care of patients.  
To be compl e tely at the service of patients. 
 It's  so difficult.  How can somebody who is not 
Christian," they asked me, "do that? "  And I sa
id, "Don't you realize that Jews have high morals, 
too? "  And I knew a lot about religion because my 
grandfather and my br other taught me  a lot.  
And I said, "The moral questions, we believe in the same  things as you do."  And I tell them 

always, "Don't  you realize that Jesus was Jewi
sh?"  And, you know, French people didn't believe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
29 
 
that.  It wasn't  told to French kids at  that tim
e.  Even later the Catholic Church 99 percent -- 97 
percent of the population is Catholic
, and the Catholic Church did not
 teach that at the time, that 
Jesus was Jewish.  It was written in every church, you know, Jesus, the King of Judea, but they 
didn't understand that.  Because they put it in Latin
 so pe ople didn't know that.  So it's a very 
complicated thing, but slowly the French pe
ople took hold of them, and they understood how 
hard it was to accept that the Germans do whatever they want.  And the more the German 

became, the more the French felt.  When I say "t
he  French," I mean the ma jority of French.  I 
don't mean the whole country.  There was always 
an element who went along with the Germans.  
The Milles, for example.  You know
, the Milles was like a militia, bu
t the Milles was an army of 
French people who were for Pétain, and they fo
llowed the Germans.  They went even to fight 
with the Germans in Rus s ia, that was a good thing.  Anyway, do you want me  to go back to 

when I left  Poitiers? 

Q: Yeah.  I have one other question th
at ma y not relevant at this point. 
A: Sure.  Go ahead. 

Q: During this period, you were trying to help pe
ople and life wasn't  very easy for you either.  
Did you notice any difference between a ma n or a 
woma n that was advantageous or wa s just 
advantageous for them? 

A: We always felt at that  time that men was mu
c h more in danger than we  were.  The Jewish 
me n.  And a ll of the me n, we thought so.  But in reality, the Ge rmans arrested the woman and 

tortured and killed the wo me n the same  way -- a
nd children, as me n.  So that was, you know, at 
that time we had still ideas that  army, the soldie
rs are killed.  The me n ar
e killed, but wome n or 
civilian are not touched.  But that wa
sn't  true at all.  We  learned ve
ry fast that that didn't  apply.  
So it was a general condition for everybody.   

Q: Being a woma n, was  it easier to
 do some  of your rescue work? 
A: I don't think so.  No, because ma ny me n did 
it, too.  Many me n.  And when we left, me n 
helped us.  So I don't think it was easier, and it
 was -- just happened who was a woma n and who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
30 
 
was a ma n a nd was in a situation to help.  I don'
t think there was a questi
on of gender there.  I 
don't believe that. 
Q: Tell me  about your escape and who a
ll went with you and how you traveled. 
A: Okay.  When we decided that my sister wa
s going to try to escape the next day from the 
hospital and we had to leave, so we ma de plans 
to leave.  And everything, like I told you before, 
was taken out of the house.  And we were going ju
st to sleep there.  It
 was a big house in the 
center of town.  And at that time, that's wh
ere we lived.  But it was furnished, we had no 
furniture.  We had left everything in the east, so
 we had to rent a house with furniture.  So we 
had no furniture to move .  We moved only our pe
rsonal belongings, and then my whole class -- 
we were 9 or 10 -- 10, I think classmates, they a
ll helped.  They all kn
ew I was going to leave 
and they all helped.  And one of 
the classmates, her cousin was a pr
iest with one of the parishes.  
So the St. Segondia -- that's spelled 
S-t. for saint.  And Segondia, S-e-
g-o-n-d-i-a.  It's a small, I 
don't know i f you call that a village or town, it wa s 
either a village or town near the border.  
Closer to -- the border wa s in the 
village or next to the village, and they told me  to go to that 
priest.  So we all got -- but the night before, one
 of my classmates, Odile Dae Moril.  Her first 
name  is Odile, O-d-i-l-e.  She was a noble.  D-a-
e, and Moril, M-o-r-i-l.  She came to the house, 
and she rang our bell.  Just at the time of cu
rfew, the Germans had already come  by because they 
came just before curfew.  And she told us -- because all the Jews had to be in before the other 

people, a little earlier.  We had 
to be there at 7:00, around 7:00 and 
the French were obliged to be 
in by 8:00, some thing like that or 9:00.  So she ca
me  to the house, and she heard that there will 
be a raffle tonight.  A raffle,           r-a-f-f-
l-e, meant arresting a group of Jews.  An the police, the 
French police very often went to
 see Vilna they knew well and to
ld them t o let the Jews know 
because they couldn't do it.  They sa id it 
was the whole -- it was an
 organized and it was 
organized in such a way, do you know, Louis (ph)  organization.  So she came and said that we 

have to come  to her house.  If we stay in our 
house, we will pr obably be all arrest ed.  And I think 
until -- they can do such a thing. 
 If we come  to your house, you 
will be shot, how can they do 
such a thing?   Again, here like
 Mr. Charpentier, she was kin
d.  That was always the weapon 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
31 
 
against us.  That kindness, and sa
ying, "I cannot leave you here.  
You have to come .  You have 
to come  to my house.  If not, you will not be  able to leave tomorrow, because you will be all 
arrested.  What are you going to do?"  And I said
, "But you cannot risk your life for that."  And 
do you know, the house would have been taken?  She 
was alone in the house.  Her parents were 
sleeping some where else.  She was in school, so sh
e was in that house near -- very close to the 
school.  So I said, "We cannot do that."  She stood her ground, and she said, "You have to 

come."  And she wouldn't move, so we finally all 
went.  My father, my mo ther, my grandmother.  
My grandfather had died, so my mother lived with
 us -- my grandmother lived with us.  She was 
at that time  80.  So she came, and my two sist
ers, Helen and Rosie, the two youngest and I and 
Jackie, the little German boy.  So we all went and 
spent the night with her.  And the next day, we 

left our house, we were going back to her house. 
 And we left and my father and my sister, 

Helen, she was the next to last -- next to the 
youngest.  Rosie is the youngest.  So Helen had had 
an operation on the knee, so she couldn't ride a bike
.  So she and my father took a bus to a certain 
point and then they walked to St
. Segondia, the city I talked -- 
the little village to you about.  
And we were all going to meet in the church.  Ro
sie, the youngest, and I and Jackie.  Rosie and I, 
we rode our bike, and we took tu
rns to have Jackie on the handlebars.  And we rode to St. 
Segondia, and my mother and my grandmother were
 comi ng at -- they were staying at Odile's  
house.  And she was going was going to take them
 to the bus and put them on a bus and come  
into the center of the city, of the village, which 
was very dangerous but we had not choice.  They 
couldn't walk.  My grandmother was 80, and she 
had perhaps 10 days before, two weeks before, 
an operation, a ma jor surgical operation, surgic
al intervention in her abdome n, so she couldn't 
walk.  So we first, we drove -- we rode, Rosie an
d I, we rode our bicycl
es with Jackie, and we 
are at the church.  And then my father and Hele
n arrived at the church, 
and the priest was with 
him.  And his name is Christian De Chaumac. De
 Chaumac i s  D-e, he was a noble, too. and C-h -
- his last name  is            C-h-a-u-m- a-c.  
And he was the priest of the parish of St. Segondia, so 

he waited for us in the church, and when we arri
ved he said to me , "You are Jewish?  And I don't  

trust Jews.  Who tells me that if
 you arrested, you are not going to
 tell the Germans that I helped 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
32 
 
you?   I will help you regardless, 
but I don't trust you."  And I got so ma d and so indignant.  I 
said, "How can you even me ntion that?   We  would 
all be killed before we say a word about you.  
We would never, never say that."  And he said, "Do you remember the story of Judas with 
Jesus? "  And I said, "Yes, but we are Judas, a
nd we have not been -- you can trust us."  And I 
was so -- I fe lt like going away, 
but at the same time, you coul
dn't risk the life of so ma ny 
people.  And I told him,  "I am terribly, terribly 
upset that you believe that."  That was so wrong, 
and I had a long conversation -- di
scussion with him afterwa r d.  So
 he went and scouted the area 
to ma ke sure there is no other papauté, and then
 he came back and said, "It looks okay."  So my 
father and He len, Rosie and Jackie went, and I stayed in church all day waiting on my mother 

and grandmother.  I was the oldest of the three ki
ds.  And in our fa mily, it's  always the kids who 

ma ke the decision, you know.  Whe n we were there at
 that age, not when we were small, but at 
that age.  Mostly in Fr ance away from Lorrain
e, you know, my parents weren't so old, but they 
didn't speak French well.  We  were the ones w
ho ma de all the decisions, and the oldest was 
always in charge.  That was the way.  We ll, wh
en you are a large family, that's how things go.  

But anyway, I waited in church in about -- I don'
t know how long.  A little 
while later, we had a 
customer from our dry goods store, you know, th
e store in Poitiers who lived in St. Segondia 
near the chur ch and she had seen me, so she cam
e in the church.  And she knew me  very well, 
she said, "You know, a family was arrested, but we 
don't."  And I said, "But how did they look?"  
She said, "Nobody saw them, but we  know the Ge
rmans just found them 
a little while ago, a 
whole fa mily."  And that was atrocious, you 
know, because I didn't know what to do.  Should I 
go back to Poitiers and tell my mother and gran
dmother, or should I let them come  a nd save 
them?   But what about my father and the children ?   I just didn't  know, it was atrocious.  I never 

prayed as fervently as in that church.  Never, 
do you know, in my life.  Th
at was -- and the priest 
came in the church and saw me  praying and cryin
g.  And that's the Jewish way, okay.  I couldn't 
leave, and the priest came in and he felt very ba
d when he saw, because he knew, too, that they 
were, as the boy said to me , that he tried to see 
the people, to see if they were -- but the Germans 
wouldn't let him approach them.  The y wouldn'
t them near.  They were, you know, some where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
33 
 
prisoners.  And he couldn't see them, so -- and I 
told him I don't know what to do.  And he said, 
"Save your mother and grandmother first, if you 
can."  So I waited and then he became  very 

huma n to me.  You know, he said, "Why don't  
you come  in the presbyter"  -- you know where 

the priest lives?   "Why don't you 
come  in my house where my guardian is?"  Do you know, he 
had a woma n, like all priests living in sin.  "Why 
don't you come ? "   And they wanted to feed me  
and I said, "Absolutely not. " I coul
d not even believe all that.  And then I went in and I helped 
her to be occupied.  And then when the time  for  th
e bus to leave, I went b
ack to the center of the 
-- we were all dressed like peasants, because
 at that time -- now, you wouldn't recognize a 
peasant from a city person.  But at time , they dr
essed very differently, so we were all dressed, 
you know, with scarves on the head and long skirts 
and flat shoes.  You know, like the peasants 
were.  So I went to the bus stop, and my moth
er and grandmother arrived.  And we couldn't 
make my grandmother walk, so my grandmother,
 we sat her on the bicycle seat.  And I was 
pushing the handlebars and my mother
 was holding her, the seat to ma ke sure she doesn't  fall off.  
What I have to say, too, my grandfather was th
e greatest person on earth. 
 My grandmother was a 
nice woma n, but not at all at the 
level of my grandfather.  And sh
e was not the most generous or 
the most easy person on earth, but when she heard th
at we wanted to go and she had to have that 
operation, she said to us, "I am an old woma n.  I 
had my life.  You just 
go because with me , you 
cannot ma ke it.  Just leave me  here."  And I 
said, "Absolutely not.  
Either we all go, or nobody 
goes.  If we go, you go, too."  So she didn't -- she 
did not object to it.  She was very happy.  And 
that I have to say during the whole war, when 
people talked about relatives they had to leave 
behind, my grandmother always looked at them 
a nd said, "Not me .  I was taken by my  children 
everywhere they went."  You know, s he always 
boasted about it, she wa
s not -- she was not the 
type to be very generous with people.  But 
anyway, we took my grandmother, put her on the 
bicycle, and we left and we went 
back to the church.  It was just a street from the church.  And it 
was toward dusk, so the Germans we re probably ea
ting dinner, because we didn't see any in the 
city.  And the priest went again and scouted the 
area of the line.  You know, the way to go to the 
line.  Because there was nobody, no guards at the line.
  It was just a line, you know, an open line.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
34 
 
It was an imaginary line, but ev
erybody knew it was there.  So he went and he came back, and he 
said it's okay.  So we put back my grandmothe
r on the bike and we went.  And that was an 
extraordinary story, it's hard to 
believe it that it really happened.  As we walked in the city . . . 
Q: Oh, there's only one mi nute?   Let's cha
nge the tape before you tell the story. 
End of Tape 2.
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374

Tape 3
 
Q: So when we stopped, you were going to tell me
 about the experience of
 crossing the border. 
A: Okay.  When I me t -- when I took my grandm
other and my mother -- my grandmother on that 
bicycle and we had to walk along and it was at du
sk.  We  had to walk along the street.  I don't 
reme mber if it was a ma in street or secondary st
reet, but we had to walk along a whole street to 
go to the ligne de ma rquer, to the line -- to 
the border where, you know, none of you had friends, 
and farmers were all sitting in front of their 
houses resting at that time .  Do you know, around 
dusk.  And when they saw us -- my mother, my 
grandmother and I -- with that bicycle, they 
started to pray for us because they understood what was going on.  They had seen ma ny people 
go through, and they prayed for us; they crossed 
themselves.  Some  woman kneeled in the dirt, 
and it was pitiful to see that.  And none of them 
betrayed us, and they were all very poor, very 
poor farmers.  And the Germans we re there withthem with a lot of mone y.  But none of them 

betrayed us, they all prayed for 
us.  It was so beautiful, it's unbelievable.  You know, when I tell 
people, they think I tell them a m
ovie.  It was absolute reality.  
It was what happened to us.  And 
my mother, my grandmother couldn't believe it; they saw it, too.  And I thanked them, going by I 

thanked them.  And I told them thank you for pray
ing for us.  Then we arrived at the -- we 
walked past the street, and we a
rrived very fast to the dema rcati
on line.  And we crossed it, and 
then I me t my whole fa mily, they were all safe. 
 Another family had been arrested, people we 
don't know.  They were, let me  see, the sacrif
iced lambs, you know, for us.  We  were saved 
because the Germans we re so busy with them and 
they let us go.  They didn't  let us go, they 
didn't find us.  They didn't  look for us.  Doyou know, they were not patrolling actively.  They 

had gotten the details, arrested the whole family.  
They were satisfied with that.  So they were 
_______, and they were very busy doing all that 
work because Germans are very or ganized, you 
know.  They have to do all the paperwork, that 
was very important.  All Germans are extremely 
organized, and that's  why we were against such 
an organization that Jews could not get out and 
survive unless French people, who were not Jewis
h, helped.  It was impossible to do.  Absolutely 
impossible. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
36 
 
Q: You arranged this whole . . . 
A: Yes.  Because I told I was the oldest and I felt
 -- but all my classmates helped me.  My fiancé 

helped me, and I told my mother we are going 
to go.  And she said, "We cannot.  How can we 
go?   Look like us, we are going to al
l be arrested."  I said, "We have to try.  We  have  to go."  My 
father agreed right away, but my mother said,"What are we going to do with grandma ? "  I said, 

"We take her."  She said, "How do you want to take
 her? "  I said, "We take her on my bike."  I 
arranged all that, and it's a 
funny thing, I never had done anyt
hing like that.  I never had, you 
know, been so active in my life.  I had never 
done anything like that.  But it's very strange, 
because when we arrive d in the unoccupied France,
 I sent  a telegram to my brother.  Another 
thing I wanted absolutely to go and fast is because our brothers wanted to come back and get us.  

We knew they had written that th
ey wanted to come  and get us 
out.  And that was too dangerous 
for them to go back and forth, that wa s even 
more dangerous.  That's  twice as dangerous, you 
know, to do it twice.  And that's  why I felt we should go.  And I wanted Steph to escape, and that 

was the only way.  If we didn't escape, we would 
all have been arrested. 
 So that was the only 
way to do it.  I wasn't  alone, I organized it in
 my family, but everybody helped me .  You know, 
my friends all helped me  and so ma ny of them. 

Q: At what point in time was this? 

A: That was in August of 1942, because Steph had been in prison in July 10th, and she was in 

prison most of July.  She must have been arrest
ed end of June, I don't reme mber exactly when.  
So it has to be in August of '42, but the date I do
n't re me mbe r .  I cannot reme mber those things.   
Q: What was going on in France . . . 

A: Oh, it was -- the Germans were having trouble in
 Russia, and as soon as they start to have 
trouble in Russia, all the edicts became  worse ev
ery day.  And they made more rules and more -- 
and arrested more people and de
ported more people, but we all 
thought that the deportation was 
strictly for working.  Do you know, to send them 
to working?   We  never, never had any idea 
what really the death camps were.  We never he
ard of that.  We knew that the Germans had not 
been very -- how can I say -- sw
eet to their Germa ns that they
 arrested, you know, and put in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
37 
 
concentration camps.  But we neve
r could even realize that they 
would do that to other people.  
Do you know, it's very strange, it's very -- that we 
did not realize it.  We  couldn't figure it out, 
and how can you figure out that people can be so ba
rbaric with other people?   It's impossible to 
figure out unless yourself have barb
aric tendencies.  I feel that
 way, I don't know.  But it was a 
very strange thing, we ne ver knew what was going on.  And it's lucky because we survived, but 

we survived, too, with so much hope.  From the 
fi rst day on, we had so much hope because of de 
Gaulle.  He was our, do you know, like Pétain was a god for these people; de Gaulle wa s our -- 

he was hope with a big H.  And we believed in 
him 100 percent, and we really thought that it 
would be -- that we would survive.  And when
 my mother complained about the condition, we 
were young and we saw things differen
tly than she did.  So we . . . 
Q: We  got to stop, we got to 
stop.  The light went off. 
A: Oh, how did . . . 

Q: When we  had to stop, you were talking abou
t your mother's reaction, do you reme mber that? 
A: Yes.  She was always terrif
ied for her children.  And I alwa
ys told her that we are living 
history.  And she said, "I would 
like a little less hi story.  I coul
d do without."  And she just did 
more like any mother, she was just concerned ab
out her children.  The wo
rst blow came  when 
my sister was arrested, and she 
-- I reme mber she said we will 
never see her anymore.  And I 
said, "Why do you say that?   She's just going to go 
to work."  She said, "When they take a young 
girl like that, they are 
not going to let her come  home ."  That
's  how she felt about it.  And during 
the whole war, she always was very nice to us
.  Never cried or -- you know, but sometimes she 
would say, "How can I sleep in a bed when I don'
t know where my kids sleeps?   How can I eat 
when I don't know if she has food? "  It was very, ve
ry difficult for her.  For my father, too.  It 
was very difficult, he felt terrible that he had not
 been able to get her ou
t of there when he was 
arrested.  He cried, he said, "Steph, but you know 
that" -- and he tried to make her say certain 
things to be pleasant to the Germans and she re
fused.  She absolutely 
refused.  And one thing, 
she was not feeling well because I told you she ha
d a serious pr oblem with her kidney.  She was 
holding at the desk with her hands because he ma de 
her stand all the time.  
And he barked at her, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
38 
 
the SS, "Get your hands off my desk."  That wa
s not Hipp, that was another SS that wa s a higher 
up officer.  "Get off your  desk."  And when I wa
s in Germany and a Germa n in my offi ce would 
keep his hands on my de sk, I would do the same  thi
ng.  It was just I couldn't stand it.  It would 
just react the same  way, "Get your ha nds off my 
desk."  Demonstrate, I couldn't accept that.  
They always reme mber that happened to her.   
Q: Where did you go to? 

A: Okay.  That night we slept in that village in
 a hotel.  And the next morning, we waited all day 
for Stephanie to arrive because we thought she w
ould escape.  And she never showed up.  So that 
night we couldn't stay in that littl
e village, it was just a village. 
 So we took the train to Mogilev 
near Velle, not far from Velle.  It's a mi ning a
nd steel center.  And my 
aunt, the sister of my 
father, was living there, was retreating there with 
her family.  So we we nt and stopped there at 
their house, and Jackie was able to see his fath
er, Josie, you know.  Because Josie was with my 

aunt, and they hadn't seen each other for a long time .  And then the next  -- I don't know, the next 

day or two days later, we went to Haifa, to wh
ere my brothers were and 
we stayed with them.  
And very soon I had to leave because I wanted to c
ontinue my studies.  So 
I went first to anot her 
university, not Marseilles, 
but to I think it was Mont
pellier or ____________.  I cannot 
reme mber, but it was Montpellier, because 
Montpellier is a very well known, very good 
university.  So I went there and I went to th
e Red Cross because once you are Red Cross, you 
stay Red Cross.  You know, that's  the top schools in
 France for nursing.  In Europe at least, in all 
Europe.  So I went to the school in Montpellier 
and I had an interview w
ith the director of the 
school.  And she was an old, ugly person.  I don't 
mean ugly physically, but the first thing she 
asked me, "Are you Jewish? "   Because I told her th
at I did one first year in Poitiers and I had to 
get away from Poitiers.  She said, "Why?   Are 
you Jewish?"  And I said, "Yes, what difference 
does it ma ke?"  I told her because you have nothi
ng to lose at that time, and I could not accept 
that French people tell me that.  I just couldn't 
accept that.  And she said
 to me , "I cannot accept 
any Jewish girl here."
  And I said, "Do you realize, are 
you German, or are you French?"  And 
she said, "No, I'm Frenc h, but I cannot -- I believe in
 Hitler and I believe in
 Lovel," that was his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
39 
 
mi nister, "and I believe in all that and I cannot 
accept any Jew."  "Okay, are there any rules and 
regulations that Jews cannot be
 accepted in school?"  There wa
s none.  In unoccupied Fr ance 
there was, but not in occupied France.  And . . . 
Q: You said the opposite. 

A: Oh, in occupied France there we
re, but not in unoccupied France.  
I'm sorry.  So I said to her, 
I was really very upset and I left because she wa
s -- and in leaving I told her, "When the war is 

over and de Gaulle enters France, I will come 
back and visi t you."  But I never did.  How can 

you try to punish people years later?   Do you know 
it's i mpossible to do.  You have said that and 
you will neve r forget, but you don't go back all the way to __________ to Montpellier, to punish 

that person.  So I never did, but I was terribly up
set.  So I went back and I tried my luck in 
Marseilles, and how I went, why I went to the Red 
Cross Headquarters in Marseilles first, I never 
know.  I can't  re me mber.  There must have been a reason.  Probably some body told me  to go to 

see Mrs. Keller, K-e-l-l-e-r, who was a ma rvel
ous person.  She was Alsatian, I don't reme mber, I 
think from Strasbourg but I'm not sure.  Her daug
hter had been a nurse and died.  She contracted 
an infection as a nurse and she 
died.  And her mo ther became a nur
se because of that.  But she 
became the Regional Director  of the Red Cross in
 Marseilles.  She was a very educated woma n 
and a very nice woman.  And I met her, I am su
re some body must have recommended her.  Told 
me  to go to see her.  And I told her my problem.  
I told her I did one year in Poitiers at the Red 
Cross School.  I want to continue
 my schooling, but I'm Jewish.  
I told her right out.  And she 
looked at me  and said, "What does 
that mean?   Who cares what you 
are?   You wanted to become  
a nurse, you will become a nurse."  And she said, "I
 am going to ma ke sure of that."  And she 
called the Re d Cross School in Pithiviers on the te
lephone, and she talked to
 the director of the 
school who is Chabannes,      C-h-a-b- a-n-n- e-
s.  And she told her that she wants me admitted 

without a problem.  And he told her that I Jewish
, and I went to Red Cross -- she told me  go right 
away.  She told me  how to go there because I 
didn't  know much of Marseilles, you know, about 
buses and I went there.  And when I arrive d, I 
had very special reception 
because what I learned 
much later is that the brother 
of the -- not Vice -- I don't know you call that.  But she was not the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
40 
 
director, she was Assistant Direct
ress.  Her brother was the chief 
of the Militia, of the French 
Militia.  And I didn't know that, but when 
I arrived these two wome n, Ms. Lovel and Ms. 
Chabannes were there.  I don't know if it's L ovell or Lovel, some thing like that.  I don't 

reme mber her name exactly.  They were both 
there and their reception like an iceberg.  "We 
cannot accept you.  No Jew can come  in that sc
hool.  No way can we accept you."  And I said, 
"But Mrs. Ke ller said that I would be accepte
d."  "No way can you be accepted."  I wanted 
desperately to finish my studies
, and they said to me , "You ne ve
r return to Ms. Keller.  We 
forbid you to return to see Ms. Keller.  Just stay
 away from her."  And I 
said to her, "How can 
you forbid me ?   You don't accept me  in the school, a
nd you forbid me  to go to see Mrs. Keller?"  

And I went straight back to Mrs. Keller and 
I told her what had happened.  Oh, she was 
completely -- she took the phone and called them th
at they were going to 
be fired on the spot.  
That she's going to send me  back and she wants to 
hear that within an ho
ur I am accepted in that 
school.  And they had to accept me , but life was atro
cious for the first few months.  Because they 
treated me  terribl y, you know, I was there against th
eir will and they hated Jews.  But that was 
pure ma lice, that was the worst French people you 
could meet at that time.  And the brother was 
a doctor and he was teaching at that
 school, so he had a lot of clout
.  And his sister wa s Assistant 
Director, so you know -- so anyway, for severa
l months nobody -- I mean the admi nistration, the 
students were okay, you see.  But the admi nist
ration, nobody would respond to my greetings.  I 
had to greet them, I had to be polite, but I 
was never obsequious.  You know, I never tried to 
enter into their good grace.
  I just did my work, I was polite, 
but I stayed away from them.  But 
they were horrible with me .  I tell you they woul
d not even talk to me  or answer my greetings, 
nothing.  And then after several mo
nths, slowly they changed.  
We  had our own clinic at the 
small private hospital for the Red Cross, for that 
school.  And the director 
slept in that building, 
and every night she would go around and talk to th
e patients about the students and ask them 
their evaluations of the students.  And my evalua
tions were such -- the patients loved me  because 
they said I was always smiling.  You know, I neve
r told them who I wa s, what problems  I had, 
nothing.  But I was doing my duty, and I was alwa
ys pleasant and I was al
ways taking well care 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
41 
 
of them.  And then slowly they
 accepted me , and it was a slow process.  But finally they were 
even very nice to me  after, you know, but the 
beginning was -- I never thought I could finish but 
I did.  I fini shed school in these conditions, bu
t when I finished school, they were already 
completely different to me than in the be
ginning.  So that was quite an experience. 
Q: Wa s there relationship between -- I was asking 
if there was any kind of
 official relationship 
between the Red Cross and Vichy. 
A: I cannot tell you official.  That
 would mean there was a written statement.  I don't know.  But, 
for sure, the Vichy as the Red Cross was extreme 
right in general.  And not only the right, they 

were for Pétain and Vichy 100 percent, and they 
never helped the Jews in the camps.  Never did 
anything in the camps to help them, and they -- 
I mean the camps in France.  My uncle who had 
been in Drancy and my mother made him escape a
nd then he was arrested, he was not the type of 
person who stayed out of trouble during the war.  
Because he was not at all the type of person 

who looked for trouble.  But he was the real sc
holar, you know, and the real doctor, and he did 
not know how to save himself.  So he was again 
arrested in Marseilles, 
and I went every day to 
see him in the camp whi c h was outside of Mars
eilles and brought him fo
od and clothing, cleaned 
his laundry and all that.  And that
's where I saw a departure, that
's the only time I saw a departure 
of deportees.  He was put on that train, and 
some body from the Jewish organization who knew 
him very we ll got him out.  He said, "That ma n doe
sn't  belong there."  But he -- and then later he 
was saved by one of my uncles who got him out
 in a car from a camp. 
 And that uncle was 
deported and never came back.  You know, that
's  how things were, but Max, who was a 
ma rvelous person, and he survived the war 
because we ma de him go to Switzerland. 
Q: But the Red Cross, you saying . . . 

A: Yeah.  But the Red Cr oss, they never helpe
d, so in that camp, I saw deportation and I saw 
thought the Red Cross was absolutely not doing a
nything in the camp.  They were there because 
they were supposed to be there, but they didn't help anybody.  They didn't take care of patients.  

And I saw the Germans and the French Prefect 
and Super Prefect, which is the highest -- you 

know, like your governme nt, in the 
camp ma king sure that everything was according.  And I saw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
42 
 
people, Germans and Fr ench people -- mostly German
s, taking the babies out of the arms of the 
nurses and pushing the mothers in the wagons.  I sa
w all that.  I didn't see the wagons, but I saw 
them pushing them towa rd the railroad which was behind.  So I couldn't see the wagons, but I 
saw how they were pushe d to all that.  And I wa
s in that little place, do you know, an office, a 

little office.  They ma de us go in there because
 they didn't want us to see, but there was a 
window.  And I was there with a French policem
an, and he started crying, sobbing, and saying, 
"I am a policeman, but I don't want to be involved in such things.  Look what they'r e doing, it's 

atrocious what they'r e doing."  And I was abso
lutely -- I never knew that such things could 

happen.  But I saw it with my own e yes.  That wa
s near Marseilles, I don't reme mber the name  of 
the camp.  Very close to Marseilles, I cannot rememb
er.  And that was in '42.  In late '42.  You 

know, about -- no, late summer of '4 2.  Perhaps Se
ptember, October, I cannot tell you exactly.  

And it was -- but I come  back to the Red Cross.  
When I was in Paris at th
e end of the war, just 
before the liberation went on, the 
resistance started fighting in the 
streets of Paris.  And they 
for med groups of nurses and doctors with th
e white flag running and pick up, you know, our 
wounded and take them to the hospital.  That's al
l Cross organized.  Whe n I went to a G-stop, the 
first thing they asked me , "Are you Jewish? "   An
d I almost killed them, I was so horrified.  I 
said, "Our lives are at the front 
of Paris and you still ask that ques
tion?  I am a Red Cross and I'm 
ashame d to be Red Cross nurse."  It was horri
ble.  Do you know, that was the Red Cross?   I 
absolutely feel that the Red Cr
oss in France, I cannot tell everyw
here else, but the Red Cross in 
France had a very bad role during the war.  And I 
will say that until the end 
of my life.  And I'm 
a Red Cross, you know, I am part of the Red Cross. 

Q: What was the political climate like 
in Marseilles compared to Poitiers? 
A: It's an enormous city.  It's an enormous
 port.  You don't know as ma ny people, but in 
Marseilles like in Poitiers, I found people who helped me .  And I found other who didn't , you 

know.  You always had both sides, but I had more people helping me  than people not helping me  

or doing wrong things to me .  Much more.   

Q: Wa s there a difference,
 though, in the whole mood? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
43 
 
A: Oh, yeah.  Because it was not occupied the 
same  way.  The Germans we
re not in charge of 
everything.  The French governme nt 
was still in charge; in Poitiers
, no, it was the Germans.  For 
example, in the office where I worked for Ger mans, we order to get out and greeting -- do you 
know it was a complete different way of living. 

Q: More freedom than the south? 

A: Oh, yeah.  There was no comparison.  We  didn'
t -- nobody wore a yellow star.  I told you that 
before.  Nobody, nobody ever wore the yellow star. 
 That doesn't  mean that Jews were not 
arrested.  That's another thing. 
 They were arrested, but it was 
in a complete different way.  
Completely different.  

Q: I was asking you a bit about Marseilles.  I kno
w that at some  point the Nazis had occupied 
Southern France, and I was wondering how that
 changed things.  And do you reme mber when 
that was? 

A: Oh, yeah.  That was in, I think, November '42.
  Yeah, I think several 
months after we made 
that -- so it changed because you ha
d the presence of the Germans. 
 But in Marseilles there were 
more Italians than Germans.  There were Germa n
s, too, but there were more Italians.  The whole 
de la ______, do you know, the ___________, all that wasmore occupied by the Italians.  And 

they were not at all like the Germans.  You didn'
t  trust them, but they were not as, you know, the 
barbaric as the Germans.  They probably did ve
ry wrong things, but I never had any run-in with 
them so I cannot judge.  But ther
e certainly people who suffer e d fr
om these type of things, but I 
didn't.  So it's difficult for me  to judge.  But th
ere were Germans all over, and they started to 
deport first foreigners and then 
they started to round up the Fren
ch.  Do you know, it was just an 
excuse, the foreigners.  That was just to ma ke 
the French feel good, that 
they are not going to 
take their own citizens.  But that di dn't  last 
very long.  And the worse the situation became in 
Russia, and worse the situation became  for us.  A
nd that's what we all told my mother when she 
complained they were doing terrible things.  
We  said, "Don't you realize they are losing the 
war?"  Much before they lost the war.  They are 
losing; if not, they wouldn't  be so barbaric and 
so nasty, because they know th
at they are losi ng the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
44 
 
Q: What was it like to live in this environment? 
A: You had to survive.  It's  difficult to tell you ex
actly.  It was very lonely
 for me  in Marseilles 
all alone.  I had a cousin and his wife there and 
their little girl, and I saw them once a day.  I had 
one meal a day with them.  My brother sent
, you know, was in the mountains, and he sent 

packages, Ca re packages, to them to f
eed me , too.  So, you know, for everybody because 
Marseilles, the food was very, very low.  It's  a ve
ry poor area of agriculture, so if you didn't have 
things grown in that area, then you had much less to eat.  You had toma toes and me lons and 

seasoning and things like that, 
but you had nothing else.  The 
Germans took all the food to 
Germany to feed their people.  And we had 
things like sweet potat
oes and rutabagas; you 
wouldn't ma ke me  eat these things.  Since the war,
 I never eat them.  I cannot even -- when I see 
it in the store, I walk away.  I never buy it, you 
know.  These are the things we eat.  We had no 
different very much potatoes, very seldom.  That
 was a luxury.  And people were starving in the 

street.  You would see people -- mos tly the 
people who had no connections and no money, they 
had not enough.  They were not sufficient to 
feed you, and you would see them collapse in the 
streets of hunger.  Mostly in Marseilles in that 
region.  Now, where my father's  fa mily was in the 

mountains, there was mu ch more food.  Because th
ey had cheeses, they had chicken, they had -- 
you know, there were lots of far mers.  It was a diffe
rent area.  So my brother sent me things.  My 
brother was always taking care of me , my brot
her.  And I told you that after _______, he moved 
the whole family to the Cottian, which is in
 the mountains.  The ma ssif _______, which is the 
central mountains in France, west of Lyon and a 
little more north.  We st, north of Lyon.  And 
[Souse], too, but it's west of Lyon about.  And he 
went to a resort which is called Vic-sur-cere, 
V-i-c, hyphen, s-u-r, hyphen, c-e-r-
e.  And it was a beautiful littl
e resort in the high mountains, 
and there only two roads leading to the Vic-sur-
cere.  So my brother or
ganized Jewish patrols 
night and day, and as soon the Germans were announced, then every Jewish fa mily had a place 

to go.  Do you know, up the mountains.  And ma ny, ma
ny Jews were saved due to that.  And my 
brother tried -- he became 
the chief of the resist ance in Cottia
n of the whole area.  And I have a 
book of one of his nephews, of the nephew of my 
sister-in-law who wrote 
a little paragraph like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
45 
 
that about him.  Saying not only did he save hi
s extended family and took care of everything, but 
he had such a very active role in the resistance.
  You know, I have that book here some where.  
But he was amazing.  And my brother, Arnold, the s
econd brother, was as active as Fr ed.  But he 
is not the guy who wants to be aleader.  He's  a leader, he does things.  But he doesn't  want any 
recognition for it; you know, he's that type.  And he
 -- but after the war, when the war was ended 
-- oh, but I go too fast.  They stayed in the Cott
ian, and then when things went really bad -- I 
don't know i f it was the end of '43, beginning of
 '4 4, I don't reme mber when -- my brothers 
moved my whole fa mily up even higher up in th
e mountains in Narniac, N-a-r-n-i-a-c.  But 
during that time  -- and then he was still the chie
f of resistance.  And dur
ing that time my sister, 
Helen, who was in the university at Clermont-Ferra
nd, which is to Nièvre, but it's still more west 
than Vic-sur- cere, I think it's northwest, but it's we
st of Vic-sur-cere.  She became  -- she was in 
the university, and she became extremely active.  
She had the printing machine in her home.  She 
lived two floors above the Gesta
po.  Two floors.  But she had the printed machine in her room 
where she printed, you know, all th
e posters and all the things fo
r propaganda.  And she traveled 
from city -- she was a very pretty
 girl, I will show you a picture.  
She traveled with her rucksack 
full of a mmunition from one city to the other to
 bring to the resistance.  And she was never 
caught.  Like one time she went out of the statio
n with her rucksack full of it, and a Fr ench 
policeman said, "Hey, young girl, 
show me  what  you have in your 
rucksack."  And she gave him 
a huge smile -- she was dying, but she gave him a 
huge smile, and he said, "A girl with such a 
pretty smile cannot do anything wrong.  Just go."
  And, you know, things 
like that, and she was 
in the university in Cl ermont-Ferrand in the lib
rary when the Germans, the SS or Gestapo -- I 

think it was the Gestapo walked 
in.  And the professor who was 
in the library at that time 
objected to the Germans to enter the univers
ity ground, you know, library, which is sacred for 
university.  Sacred territory.  So 
the Germans just killed him in fr
ont of the students.  They just 
shot him.  They were very nice, they were very
 sweet.  And my sister wa
s arrested and taken to 
the Gestapo, and all the Jewish ki
ds were arrested.  But she had th
e card for the Jews then, but all 
kids were arrested.  And the next day she was re
leased because they didn't think she was Jewish.

And also she was very lucky, but she was extremel
y active during the whole war.  And then after 
that, she went to a school to become  an officer 
of the Air Force, French Air Force.  But she 
couldn't finish because she had an accident, and sh
e almost lost a leg.  She had an accident with a 
bicycle in Pa ris.  But that was nothing to do w
ith the war.  And she ma rried a French Jew, Jon 
Claude Bellisianni (ph)
, who had was decorated with the hi
ghest decoration of the resistance by 
de Gaulle.  So she ma rried the ri
ght guy, and they are still married. 
Q: Let's go back to you in Mars
eilles.  Another question I had 
is how much informa tion did you 
have or communication did you have with the 
outside world?   How did you get information 

about what de Gaulle wa s doing 
and the resistance and all that? 
A: Everybody was listening to BBC in hiding.  
And do you know if you had no radio, then 
some body else told you what they heard.  It 
was just, we knew -- and then we had some  
reporters, French reporters on the radio, who always
 said the English didn't  do this and this and 

that.  But we knew they had done it, so we knew 
what was going on.  Even the last few days in 
Paris, that reporter  -- I cannot 
reme mber his name  -- he was very well known.  He was standing 
-- and he didn't  mean to do that to help us.  He
 was really on the other side, but he was always 

denying -- he was always denying that things were wrong for that.  And then we knew that he 

was denying, it was the truth, and we always cele
brated, you know.  But we knew, we listened to 
the BBC and we co mmunicated with people.  A
nd the newspapers gave us very little 
information, but it was mostly people who gave 
it.  So the most important thing was the BBC.  
Q: What was your daily life lik
e in Marseilles?   Were you 
studying?   We re you practicing 
nursing, as well? 

A: No, I was not a nurse yet; I wa
s a student.  But I was in the hospitals, yes.  The university 
hospitals were -- how do you ca
ll it?   _________ in French, do you know what that me ans?   You 
go through me dicine, surgery -- 
we called it [starge].  I don't 
reme mber how you call that in 
English, but I went through all 
this teaching and we had clas
ses every day.  Every day. 
Q: Well, why didn't you decide
 to pass as a Catholic? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
47 
 
A: I couldn't do that.  I never said that I wa
s Jewish to people around me  normally.  To the 
directors of the school, but I norma lly didn't tell pe
ople I was Jewish.  Certain people, I did.  You 
know, I really believed that I had trust for people,
 I told.  And I very seldom ma de -- but I am 
lucky, too.  I am very lucky.  That's why I am alive.  But I -- I forgot. 

Q: I'm just asking you, you ne ver chose to lie about it. 

A: No.  I never said I was Cathol
ic, never, never.  That is some
thing I just couldn't do.  When I 
was in the Ar my, I never felt I was Jewish, but I would never go to church with them and never 

told them -- I said, "I don't believe 
in that."  I never went.  I cannot 
do that.  If I went to a funeral, 
I wouldn't mind -- I don't mi nd going into a church.  
That doesn't  bother me  at all.  But if I go 
into a church, I don't kneel and I cannot cross myself
.  I cannot do that.  It's just impossible.  Do 
you know, when you learn as a child the Bible, the 
people were ostracized because of their faith 

and they didn't  bow in fr ont of kings, things li
ke that.  This impresse
s you as a kid.  And then 
later, you cannot do that.  I feel that way. 

Q: We re you able to continue 
celebrating holidays or . . . 
A: Yeah.  They didn't eat meat most of the 
time because there was no kosher meat.  But for 
holidays, they had the Shavuot and they had to tr avel to Aarau, to the capitol to go to the shop 

and come  ba ck, but they always did.  One time my
 father decided he couldn't  stand it anymore, 
he wants me at.  Because my brothers and my si
ster-in- law and my youngest 
sister say -- and my 
mother let them and my father didn't.  So one tim
e my father said he eats meat and then he was 
sick for 24 hours because he had eaten unkosher 
meat.  And he was not as religious as my 
mother, but still that was against al
l his beliefs.  He couldn't do it. 
Q: How long did you stay in Marseilles? 

A: A year and half, about.  In '43, I think in Oc
tober or November '43, I left Marseilles and I 
went back to Paris.  My sister, my oldest sister
, lived in Paris.  That was after I graduated.  It 
must have been in November -- in Oc tober '
43 -- oh, yes, in October '43, the day -- I don't 
reme mber now if it was the day of my examination or the day before, I read the newspaper.  And 

I knew that my fiancé had been arrested.  I knew 
that, and that he was condemned by the French 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
48 
 
Tribunal to life in prison for re
sistance.  But then I didn't know 
anything else, and that morning I 
read the paper like I always read
 the paper.  And I saw that four
 of the five of these young people 
had been shot.  It was wr itten in the paper, and 
that was in Oc tober of '43.  I think it was the 6th 
of October they were shot, so I must have read
 it the 7th, the 8th.  A
nd I had my exa mination on 
that day or the next day, I ca
nnot remember.  But anyway, I read that, but I didn't know which 
one of the five had been saved.  I never knew until
 after the war.  After Lincoln.  No, I knew it -- 
I got in touch with girls in Po
itiers.  Do you know with classmates
?  And they let me know if yes 
or no, and I heard that Jack was killed and his brother.  He had two brothers, the two only kids of 
that family were shot together.  These two others 
in Paris in Moldavia.  That's the place in Paris 

on a little hill where the Germans 
shot the French people, resistan
ce people.  And I didn't know if 
I should take my exa m or not, but my brothe
r had put so much mone y, you know, and so muc h 
effort to keep me  in school that I felt I should.  So
 I finished, I got it.  A
nd then after that, I went 
back to Paris to be with my sister.  Because 
I had nothing to do in the mountains.  I couldn't 
walk, I couldn't find any work.  In Paris I knew 
I could find work, and I 
worked in Paris.   
Q: Did you get involved in any kind of 
resistance activitie
s in Marseilles? 
A: In Marseilles?  No, not really, no.  I didn't 
have the opportunities.  
I remember my br other 
came to see me one day, and we met in the stre
ets a lawyer from Metz, a classmate of my 
brother, who I knew.  And he had been in th
e Army, and he and my brother talked about 
resistance.  That was very much the beginning, be
fore my br other moved to the Cottian, to the 
mountains when he was still young.  But I told them
 that I want to join, too, and they looked at 
me  and that lawyer said to me , 
"Little girls cannot do it.  See, we
 don't wa nt little girls to risk 
their lives," you know.  And I reproa
ched him, and after the war when I me t hi m, I said, "I could 
never forgive you for having said that."  I was 
so ma d at hi m, and I had no opportunity in 
Marseilles to really
 join anything.   
Q: You went to Paris.  Was it easy to get 
back and forth, to go where you wanted to go? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
49 
 
A: No, no.  It was not.  There we
re controls in the train, and th
e German came and controlled my 
papers.  But I was lucky and they didn't  think I 
was Jewish until after I go.  They didn't question 
me .  I was always very lucky. 

Q: We re you afraid? 

A: I don't even reme mbe r .  I don't reme mber that, 
how I dared to do that.  I was probably afraid, 
how can you not?   You know, for a fe w mo me nt
s until they leave you, you don't know what's 

going to happen to you.  I sure I was afraid.  But 
I arrived in Pa ris and I joined my sister and 
lived with her.  And she lived in an apartmen
t rented by non-Jews.  That was the only way we 
could do it.  And we had to move several times. 
 Because when some body got arrested and they 

had our address, we had to move to make sure
 that they, you know, they were tortured, you don't 
know what people can talk.  And you cannot tr
ust anybody, not because you don't trust them, but 
I don't know if I would talk under torture.  
Nobody can know, nobody can judge that.  Because 
you don't know how you would react to that unle
ss you have gone through that.  And even if you 
got through that, one day you ma y not talk and 
another day you ma y talk.  Do you know, you can 
be a hero one time and be the worst coward anot
her time .  Tha t  same  person, that doesn't  mean 
that -- you cannot be always hero when you ha ve no brain; you don't think.  And you have no 

reflexes, you just -- you are just musc
les.  That's  how I feel about it. 

Q: Just tell me a little bit about what you did in Pari
s, the political environment, just what was it 

like being there?    

A: Okay. 

Q: Now, this is the beginning of 1944? 

A: No, end of '43.  Until the liberation of Paris.  
First, I started to work for an agency, because I 
couldn't work in a hospital.  That was too da
ngerous.  They would ha
ve inquired about ma ny 
things.  But I worked for a privat e agency who placed me  in families.  And I was the luckiest  

person.  I got to know marvelous people, and they
 were -- the people I worked for usually were 
on my side.  They didn't know I was Jewish, I didn't  tell them.  I couldn't tell them, they were -- 

it was too risky for them to know.  If they were 
arrested, they could absolutely say they didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
50 
 
know.  But if I tell them, they have no chance.  It
's  not right, it wasn't  right.  But I worked for 
them, and they knew I was on, you know, on the same  side.  Their son became very involved in 
the resistance, and he joined the Second Ar my -- do you know -- no, that's  French words.  Do 

you know for army it's difficult for me to find the wo
rds in English.  So bandes of the Division of 
Bandes of La Claire, he joined.  My second cousin
 joined them, too, and he went to Be rlin; he 
was in Berlin for a year and a half or two.  And 
Fred went into a school for officers, because he 
had been just an enlisted ma n in the Ar my.  
He was only drafted, he was never, you know, an 
Ar my person.   

Q: When you were working for this fa mily, wh
at kind of work were you doing?   We re you doing 
nursing? 

A: Yeah.  Private nursing for the old lady -- th
e old brother of the woma n.  And she was a 
marvelous person.  Her name was Mrs. Lucca (ph). 
 I cannot reme mber the name of the mother, 
but her son and the brother of Madam Lucca was th
e Curator of the Louvre, you see.  And they 
were cousins of French poets, it was a ma rvelous
 fa mily.  And I had a ma rvelous time with them, 
and they were very helpful.  They even wh
en they knew that we 
were in danger because 
some body had been arrested that we knew, they gave
 us an apartment to stay there.  We were 
extremely lucky.  We became very friendly with them. 

Q: Did you go to church? 

A: No, I couldn't.  There was no reason. 

Q: What was going on in Paris?   We re ther
e a lot of roundups?   We re there deportations? 
A: Yes.  And we lived as norma lly as possible.  
My sister and I, we went to the theater, we saw 

Octagon.  We saw Octagon which was a terrific play at that time, because if you know Octagon, 

do you know Octagon?   It's  play now, but the play 
of Octagon is a team of the Berlin prison, and 
her uncle is going to have her killed.  And the gua
rds talk about her and her life and her killing 
like she wouldn't exist.  And it was exactly what  
the order tried to do to show what the Germans 
were doing.  And there were Germa ns in the room
, in the hall.  They were there and they 
applauded, and they didn't  even think of what r
eally  the meaning was.  And the French were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
51 
 
wild, you know, they applauded these scenes absolute
ly.  I reme mber that one
 night I saw that -- 
and others, we went to movies.  We  went to th
ings, but we had -- I was always extremely lucky, 
because ma ny times, I don't say once or twice.  I 
cannot remember how many ti mes, but let's say 
several time s, I went to the station, a subway st
ation, ready to go downstairs and then walk away.  
And I never knew why, and then suddenly I hear
d the whistles and Germans were arresting 
people.  So I was never caught in such a thing. 
 I always walked away from it.  Do you know 
that's -- I was very lucky.  There's is no other 
explanation, because I didn't do it because they said 
it's dangerous.  I just stopped and walked away. 
 And I have a sixth sense of danger, I don't know 
how I got it, but I have a sixth sense.  Because
 that happened to me , that's why I'm alive.  
Because in Germany, too, that happened.  Do you 
know, that I suddenly sensed that I couldn't go 
any further, that I had to stop.  So . . . 

Q: Wa s it wartime conditions there?  I mean 
was there enough to eat?  Were there . . . 
A: We  had enough to eat, but ma ny people starved 
in Paris, too.  People who had no money were 
starving.   

Q: Was it easier to get by in a 
big city like Paris as  a Jew?  
A: Yes.  If you had friends who rented an apartm
ent, yes.  But if you had no friends doing these 
things, then it was as di fficult as anywhere else.  
Or worse, because that was in occupied France.  
But it depended who you knew and who helped you, and I told you that before.  That no French 

person would have survived the ma rvelous, if yo
u can call it ma rvelous, but extremely effective 
organizations of the Germans if they were not he
lped.  It was impossible.  And Jews could not 
help you, they were in the same  situation as you 
were.  It was the non-Jews  who could help you.  
But everything they did for us was always, always at
 the risk of their life.  And that's  what so 
beautiful about it, that they di
dn't hesitate.  And, for example, 
the family who rented the first 
apartment for my sister and several apartments, a
nd then that other lady give her her apartment.  
But every time they rented an apartment, the mo
ther and father knew about it and the sons knew 

about it.  There were two sons.  The father wa
s a lawyer.  The mother was a very educated 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
52 
 
person.  The two sons, one was a doctor; the othe
r was a lawyer.  They were -- do you know, but 
they did not hesitate to do these things. 
Q: Let's change the tape. 
End of Tape 3.
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
53 
 
Tape 4
 
A: Oh, no.  Do you know, I helped, whoever need
ed little help, the Jews or non-Jews . . . 
Q: All right.  Hold on.  Were you involved in 
any kind of resistance efforts while in Pa ris? 
A: Not any structured resistance at
 all, but I felt always that just
 by surviving that was resisting.  
By not dying, others thought that
 was already resistance, and th
at was a victory.  Any Jew who 
could survive or any French person who could su
rvive was resisting the Germans.  And by being 
hidden, hidden in a way because we 
did not rent an apartment in our
 na me of things like that, but 
we still normally.  We went out
 in the streets, we  did thi
ngs.  So we felt resisting. 
Q: This ma y be a strange question, but as you r
ecount your experiences to me , you'r e doing this 
in a very lively way.  And you're telling me  that
 you were able to go to a theater and that you 
tried to maintain a some what normal life.  But my
 sense is it really wasn't , couldn't have been 
that cheerful. 
A: No, it was terrifying because you always ha
d very much -- you worried terribly about your 
fa mily.  You know, I didn't know what was going 
on in the Cottian, we had no relationship.  We  

had no communications between Paris and the Cottian where my pa
rents were.  So it was very 
difficult to know what they were doing, and it wa s -- we worried enormo usly.  If you want to 

survive, you have to live, and to live, you have to
 live as close to norma l as possible.  But that 
doesn't  mean we went to the theater all the time
 or to the mo vies.  Only when it was some thing 
unusual, like Octagon, or there was a movie, I 
reme mber, about scaling 
mountains.  That was 
another symbol of resistance to the Germans, so
 every French person knew that that movie was 
ma de for that purpose.  So we all went to see th
at movie.  You see, these are the things which 
were very important.  And we had books which in
 a very subtle way showed that we were 
resisting, do you know?   These were
 complete different environment and a complete way of life 
in that way.  We  were always looking for what
 the meaning of our survival means.  Do you 
know, what we can do to survive and what meaning it has.  But if you lose your whole fa mily, 

then there is not much meaning to it.  It was ha
rd enough for us to lose my sister.  We  lost an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
54 
 
awful lot of uncles and aunts and cousins, an awfu
l lot.  I don't know if I count them, there's at 
least 25 or 30 or more.  I never counted them really.  So . . . 
Q: So what else can you tell me about Paris up until liber ation? 

A: We  just survived, that's all.  Do you know, it'
s difficult to reme mber events, different events, 
but it was a constant -- we moved 
there and took up refuge in other people's home s when we felt 
that we were trapped by some thing.   

Q: And the Germans we re everywhere? 

A: Oh, everywhere.  Everywhere you went, they had the best of guns.  You know, the had the 

best of guns.  They had all the best ma nsions in
 Pa ris.  They were everywhere.  Whe r ever you 
went, they were there.  And they
 went out a lot, they went to 
theaters everywhere.  They had the 
money, they had the means.  That's . . . 

Q: We re there ever situations where 
these German flirting with you or . . . 
A: Oh, they tried.  They tried 
always to, you know, to stop the girl
s and talk to them.  But all 
armi es do, but we didn't respond; we walked awa
y.  But when they saw that we didn't respond, 
you know, they didn't dare do anyt hi ng.  They still ma intained a behavior which was different 

from the Eastern countries.  In France, they alwa
ys had to behave differently.  That doesn't  me an 
that they were not barbaric and cau
sed terrible things and did terrib
le things, but their behavior in 
general had to be okay.  Because we were in 
a Western country, and th
ey had orders.  And you 
know Ger mans obey orders, they
 are very good at that.   
Q: Describe for me  liberation, please. 

A: Oh, that was different.  We  knew the Army 
was arriving, and we knew 
that Paris -- we heard 
that Paris wa s going to be destroyed by the German
s, but they never destroyed it.  And the last 
night they were, or the last da
y, during the whole day there were
 posts with ma chine guns at 
almost every intersection with a 
group of soldiers waiting for the Army.  But we didn't see any 
more tanks in Paris, but we saw were these little machine guns, they could do enough dama ge.  

But the resist ance had already starte
d for several days to fight agai
nst them.  And there battles in 
the street, and that's why I told 
you I tried to go to the Red Cross, 
they wanted to be partners; it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
55 
 
was their duty.  They simply wouldn't accept it. 
 So -- but the resistance had wounded them, too, 
Germans.  But they were very 
active all of the time
.  But then, suddenly that was when the 
French Second Division of La Cl
aire entered Paris first.  The Americans gave them that 
ma rvelous courtesy to enter Paris 
first, and we knew that.  We h
eard that on the radio.  That guy 
who I told you, that reporter, 
announced that now -- or was he 
hearing from so
me body else?   I 
don't re me mber.  But the reporter announced that th
e Army is entering Paris, one of the doors, I 
don't re me mber if it was [Borneo] 
one of the doors of Paris.  A
nd then all the windows opened in 
the whole neighborhood, and I know in every ne
ighborhood in France, and everybody started to 
sing the Marseillaise.  And the Germans posts were
 still down there, and they looked up to us but 
they didn't shoot.  And then the Army came in 
and they disappeared, the Germans disappeared.  
They knew that -- what could they do against 
tanks?   There was a whole division of tanks 
comi ng in.  And then at 12 o'clock De Gaulle 
went to the capitol, Notre Da me , and ha d a big 
ma ss of celebration.  But -- and the next day, I took my bike, I rode all over Paris, and they were 
shooting everywhere because there we re snipers on 
the roofs.  And they we
re shooting all over.  
And I didn't find that that was dangerous.  Y
ou know, I just rode ar
ound, I was living really 
history then.  You know, that was my life.  And I wa
s so excited about it, a
nd then the next day -- 
do you know that was the next day when the Army
 entered Paris.  And that's how we were 

liberated, but there were stil
l snipers for two, three days. 
 And then suddenly, you know, it 
slowly -- they were arrested, be
aten, shot.  I wasn't  involved.  

Q: German s nipers? 

A: Yeah.  Or French, do you know, the French who 
were against -- who we re for Pétain.  There 
were some , there were some  of the m, called 
the collaborators.  Y
ou know, they ones that 

collaborated with the Germans had everything to 
lose.  So that's how it happened.  That was 
quite an event, you know, of periods, this Army comi ng in.  But we didn't know what had 

happened to my fa mily.  But a while, perhaps 
a week or two, I don't re me mber, but it took so 
long to -- because the Army was coming from
 Normandy going east from Nor mandy and from 
Britannia, fro m Britain.  But then anot her Ar
my came up from the south, from [France], and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
56 
 
went up north.  So they were completely di ffe rent fi elds of ba ttle, and the Cottian was 
completely in a different zone.  We  c ouldn't 
have any communications for quite a while until 
they were liberated, too.  But luckily, they all 
survived, but had horrendous adventure.  My sister, 
Rosie, was caught -- the youngest, sh
e was caught in a forrest at ni
ght.  She had that day, there 
was a resistant who had been shot in the village 
of Narniac, and they had nobody to take care of 
him.  So she went to anot her village to find the priest because he had some  nursing experience.  

To ask him to come  and the priest refused to co me .  And she was comi ng back from that priest -- 

I me t that priest later when I came on -- but I di
dn't  tell you what it was.  But, you know, I wasn't  
there and I couldn't do that.  But anyway, she came  
back in that forrest late at night, and she was 
suddenly arrested by a group of Ger mans in the forrest
.  And the officer said, "She's  just a little 

girl," and his aide or some body else -- but she 
understood what they were saying, but she ma de 

believe that she didn't understand, she didn't tell 
them she spoke German.  And then the aide 
said, "Why, don't you see that she's dressed like th
e resistance?"  You know, she was in shorts 
and a shirt like the kids in the resistance were dr
essed.  And he said, "Oh, come  on.  She's just a 
kid."  And he refused to do anything, so they let her go. 

Q: Let's get back to you in Paris.  Now, I know 
that talking about your fa
mily would be really 
interesting because they all had . . .  

A: They did an awful lot . . . 

Q: . . . very important experiences, that for toda
y, let's continue with you in Paris.  Wh at you did 
after the liberation.  You found out 
that your family was all alive? 
A: Yes, at a later date.  And th
en, I decided to join the Army. 
 I didn't tell my mothe r .  And I 
tried, and it was extremely difficult to join the 
Army because they were afraid to begin bad 
elements.  You know, who wanted to hide in the Ar
my that passed.  So you had to have all kinds 
of certificates and recomme ndations and I finally was 
able to join the unit of former resistance.  
And the chief of that -- the chie
f of that unit was Colonel Fabi
an, who was very well-known as 
resistance.  And his name is 
F-a-b-i-a-n.  And Colonel Fabian
 was a Communist, and his group 
was a Communist group, but I didn't know that.  
When I arrived, I was very broken because my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
57 
 
reception wa s very bad.  Because the guy who star
ted to question me , he asked me what I done 
in the resistance, and I told hi
m I did certain things, but person
ally I would never restructure 
group of resistance.  And he just bawled me  out, a
nd I was supposed to -- as a nurse, I came  as a 
nurse.  I was sent as a nurse.  Then he said 
to me , "You are not going to be a nurse, you are going 
to be a social service person, social service."  A
nd I never had done that in my life, and then he 
refused to give me  my grade.  You know, nor ma ll
y as a nurse, you're an officer.  He said, "You 
will be a soldier, because  you didn't do anything 
during the war."  And I told him, "Do you know 
my fiancé?"  He was very well-known there, even
 books written for his story and his brother.  
Because they did very ma ny things, they even attacked a train, you know, sabotaged the train of 

_________, the German ________.  And they killed ma ny Ge rmans by that sabotage, so they 

were very we ll-know.  And I said, "But he was my
 fiancé, and I lost him.  Don't you t hink that's 

already something?"  He said, "He died, but 
you survived and you didn't do anything."  He was 
absolutely atrocious, so he treated me  terribly.  And then he told me  I wa s a sergeant, and I told 

him but as a nurse, I'm supposed to be a nurse.  
And he said, "Not here.  For us, you're just a 

sergeant."  He was another Communist, how can I 
say?   Real strong Communist.  So he said, 
"Did you ever join the Co mmunist group?"  I said
, "No, I'm not a Communist.  Why would I join 
the Communist group?"  And he said, "But we we
re the only resistance."  I said, "No, you were 
not.  There were other people re
sisted, too."  And we had a big fight.  Anyway, I became  a 
sergeant, and I did my work as a 
social -- in the social service a
nd took care of the kids.  I went 
to the front, you know, which wasn't very far.  Th
ere was a river, we were on one side of the 
river.  The Germans we re on the other side of th
e river.  A little bit, 
but not a lot, you know, in 
Alsace.  And I went every day to the front, aske
d them what they wanted, you know.  They were 
very happy because nobody else was doing that.  So 
one day, I was there very little time, and I 
felt very much as an outsider.  But I didn't 
complain, I was in the Army; I didn't comp lain. 
Q: Why did you want to join the Army?   What motivated you? 

A: Why?  

Q: Um-hum (yes). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
58 
 
A: To comb attre, to fight back.  They had 
done so ma ny bad things, you had to do some thing 
about it and defend your country. 
 My country helped me  so much, why wouldn't I help my 
country?   I am not a perhaps a can
didate, but it just happened that
 way.  But it's true, you know, I 
was helped by so ma ny people, and 
we were still fighting, why would 
I, as a girl, not do it?   I had 
no reason, and as a nurse, I had a 
real good reason to go there and help people.  I never thought 
of doing anything else.  Anyway, I went -- I was 
walking the street one morning, late morning, 
and that Colonel Fabian saw me  near the headqua
rters near his office.  And he called me , he 
never had talked to me.  Didn't know me, didn't 
know who I was.  And he said to me , "Would 
you mi nd manning my telephone?"  
We were mo ving to another --probably it was during the 
Bulge, you know?   The Battle of the Bulge.  A
nd he had to go back because we couldn't go 
forward -- we couldn't advance because of the Battle
 of the Bulge.  We  wer e  all stopped there.  
And he said to me  -- I think it was at that ti
me , I'm not sure.  But anyway, we were mo ving 
some where else.  And he said, "Can you ma n the 
office during the time  I take lunch?"  I said, 
"Sure."  And he said to me , "I 'm sor r y, but we
 have nothing to read for you.  There are only 
German books."  And I told him, "Oh, I have
 German fluency."  He said, "Do you speak 
German? "   I said, "Yes, I speak German fluently
."  And he looked at me  and he said, "Would 
you be able to do intelligence work
?   We desperately need people to do intelligence work."  And 
I never was able to resist a challenge, so I sa
id, "Sure."  After that I wondered what was wrong 
with me , to have accepted, but then I said, "Yes."
  And seven days later, I was transferred.  
Some body picked me  up in a Jeep, and I was transf
erred to the intelligence.  And I was trained, 
you know, to go into mi ssion and then they tried to get me  through the Ge rmans ' lines 14 times.  

But . . . 

Q: What kind of traini
ng did they give you? 
A: How to recognize units.  When you look at 
them, talk to them, you know, from where they 

come .  From what area.  You know, you had to l
earn all that, and to recognize equipment.  
German equipment.  How to ask questions.  A
nd they let me  choose on my own what story I 
wanted to use to give as a r
eason for being in Germany if I '
m questioned.  And that was a good 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
59 
 
idea, because if some body imposes a story on you, 
you ma y not keep it right.  And I felt that the 
best way was to say that I'm in love with a Germ
an's son here and that I was looking for him.  He  
had disappeared and I was looking all over for him.
  The Germans are so sentimental for these 
type of things, that is -- and it worked very we
ll.  It helped me  tremendously.  And at the same  
time, I was a very young girl, I knew it would protect
 me  because I had a fi ancé I loved so much.  

So I wouldn't have to worry about it, you know.  So
 I felt that was the right story, and I proposed 
that to them.  I had to tell them what I wanted
 to do.  And they thought that was an excellent 
story, so they found a German.  The y took him, 
put him in a reservation, and I had the picture 
and I had letters from him, one or two; I don't reme
mber.  And all that and they ma de sure that he 
was kept in isolation until I came back because 
that I don't me et him some where and I shouldn't.  
So that's how things worked out.  Then I was trai
ned in all these type of 
things.  Do you have any 
more questions about that? 

Q: Yeah.  Well, who was the leader of your 
unit, and what was the spirit of your . . . 
A: The leader of the real unit was a captain who I 
couldn't spell.  He was Alsatian and I had a lot 
of trouble later with him.  He was _______, but he wa
s not located in the same  city as we were.  
I was at that time in Mulhouse, and he was in St
. Denis, which is south near the Swiss border.  

And I had very little contact with him, I knew him 
very little.  But later when I got to live in the 
same  place as he did, then we got into lots of trouble with him.  I got in a lot of trouble with him.  

But not because of anything sexual, but because  we
 did not agree.  But that is for later, but 
anyway, then I . . . 

Q: We re there other Jewi sh people in your . . . 

A: Not that I know, no.   

Q: But you were treated equally? 

A: Oh, yeah.  They didn't know I was Jewish.  I neve
r told them.  If I had told them I am Jewish, 
they would never have trusted me  with that ty
pe of work.  This was 
not some thing you tell 
people in the French Army at that
 time.  Now they are all for Isra
el, and they are very for Jewish, 
but not at that time .  Most of them, not all of 
them, but most of them ca me from North Africa.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
60 
 
Do you know, with the American Army?   They were
 in North Africa and were from t here, they 
had fought in Corsica, in Italy, and then they went
 to France.  Most of them, not all.  And they 
came with the American Ar my and they came from the south, from North Africa.  So that's one 
thing I wouldn't have told them.  I never di
scussed that, they never aske d me  because nobody 
ever thought -- and I had not given the name  Ho
ffnung, they didn't even know my na me .  Only 
very few people knew my na me , the big ch
iefs, but nobody else knew my real name . 
Q: What was your name  on your identity card?  

A: Of what?  Of French identity card?  

Q: Yes. 

A: I had no identity card. 

Q: We ll, I thought that you had gotten false papers. 

A: Oh, yeah.  But that was Hoffnung, that was al
ways my real name .  And that I was born in 
Lorraine.  I always kept that, bu
t when I was in the Army in intelligence , when I was with the 
Fabian, unit, then I was under Hoffnung.  But as 
soon I joined the intel
ligence, they ma de me  
change names, and I chose the name of Lelotra because during the war, that's the name I used for 

my fiancé to write to me.  Because he could not 
from Poitiers write to me 
in my name, so I had 
shortened -- and that name  I continued keepi
ng in the Army.  And everybody knew me under the 
name  of Lelotra, which is L-e-l-o-t-r-a which is 
a very French name .  It's t he name  of t he ma n 

who designed the gardens for Louis XIV,
 Lelotra.  So I liked that name . 
Q: What was it like serving as a woma n?  
 Wa s it different than serving as a ma n?  
A: Yeah.  It was different in 
a way.  You -- but they didn't gi
ve me  any trouble about being a 
woman.  But it was di fferent, I was not in the infa
ntry.  I was in the inte
lligence, but the people 
in the intelligence didn't do the wo
rk of the infantry either.  
You know, we were all doing the 
work of intelligence. 

Q: Maybe being a woma n had its advantages. 

A: But no, I really cannot tell you.  Because yeah, 
it would be more difficult to ha ve sent a young 
ma n to Ger many my age because he would be in
 the Army, he wouldn't be walking around.  In 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
61 
 
that way, yes, it was mu ch more i mportant to have a woma n.  And anybody who spoke German 
was important to the intelligence.  They had not
 so ma ny people who spoke German a bsolutely 

fluently.  I ha d a Lorraine accent, but I had always
 said I come from Lorraine.  But I told the 
Germans that my parents died, that everybody was bombed a nd killed by these horrible 

Americans.  And, do you know, I had a good story, and so that's how things worked.  I'm trying 

to reme mber where I am. 

Q: We ll, you were going -- I think you were abou
t to tell me about your efforts to get over the 
border, but since we only have a coup
le mi nutes left on this tape, let'
s save that.  I'm just trying to 
envision you doing this work and how it mi ght have 
been different for you as a Jew, as a woma n, 
doing this really very, very dangerous work. 

A: Oh, I felt it was my duty to do it.  As a Jew and as a French person.  I fe lt absolutely, I could 

never stand that people say, "You can go to the Ar
my, I don't need to," you know.  For example, 
my cousin, Oscar, who was from Germany, he would never -- he was saved by the Fr ench and all 

that.  And I had big fights with him because he would never think of joining the Army , he was 

not that type, you know.  And I told him that that's
 his duty, to join the Ar
my.  That the French 
give him hospitality, even without knowing he's 
German, but  he still surv
ived of that and he 
should fight.  I was the type . . . 

Q: I think you were about to tell me  what you actually did for the French Ar my. 

A: Okay.  The fi rst time I tried to cross the li
nes was near Thann which is in Auvergne.  And 
Thann is T-h-a-n-n.  And there were quite highmountains, the Vosges, but
 it was a plain winter 
and it was snow.  I had snow to almost to my wais
t.  And they had organi
zed -- I had joined the 
Commander s  of Africa, which is a unit.  And the 
Colonel of that unit was Bouvet, B-o-u-v-e-t.  
And I was sent -- I was brought by my intelligence 
unit to that commando so that they helped 
cross.  And the Colonel Bouvet ha
d a daughter my age, and he took 
a terrific liking to me .  And 
he helped me  -- do you know, he was so worried that some thing happens to me , so a whole 

group of people came with me  of the Ar my.  A 
Captain was chief of the group, and then there 
was at least 10 more people.  And some  soldiers, 
three or four more officers and some  soldiers, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
62 
 
to accompany me  to a certain little way in th
e mountains, I don't re me mbe r  how you call that.  
This sentier in French, which is a small passage
wa y in the mountains.  And I had been explained 
what to do, that I come to that -- they will acco
mpany me to that point, then they would leave 
me .  And I would walk along that little se ntie
r, that little passag
eway, until I reached the 
Germans, who would be -- and I knew where I 
could find them.  And the Colonel said, "Just 
below where you reach the Germans, I am going to have a group of my people watch for you, 
and if you feel that the Ge rmans have underst
ood what's going on, that they are going to harm 
you, you scream and they come  and get you."  You know, they were commanders.  "They come  

to get you.  You don't need -- I abso
lutely want you to be safe."  
And I went, and that was in the 
mi ddle of the night and we arrive
d to that pl ace where they left 
me.  And I started walking, and it 

was before sundown -- sunup, much before.  And it 
was very gray, it was a lot of snow, very 
cold.  But when I walked, I saw a group of two soldiers, German soldiers, in a post hidden below 

me .  But I continued, I had no intention -- they we re
 looking, they saw.  Bu
t I had no intention of 
talking to them because I want to go to the post; I di
dn't want to talk to them.  I wasn't  told to do 
that, you know, I was told to go there.  But I kne
w where they posts, I noticed.  But I continued 
walking, and just when it became  a little less gra
y, I arrived at a little in the mountains.  And 
there were forests, and I came in an intersection 
of the roads, of the lit
tle mountain roads.  And 
suddenly a soldier arrested me , and I thought he 
was a German, but he was a French soldier.  
And he was a Moroccan and then there were
 several Moroccan around him who ca me  towards 
me , and they want to shoot me  because they thought that was a German spy.  And I said, "No 

shooting, no shooting."  Because they were 
telling me , " We are going to shoot you, you dirty 
German spy."  They were insulting me , do you know, in French because they spoke Fr ench.  

They were French soldiers. 
 And I said, "Oh, no" . . . 
Q: Could I ask you to stop for a mo ment? 

A: Sure. 

Q: Okay.  So the Moroccans were ready to shoot you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
63 
 
A: Yes, and I told them, "Don't shoot.  Call your 
officer," because I knew 
that they always had 
an officer.  But I didn't know who they were.  And th
en they called their office, and I said to him, 
"Why was I arrested?"  And he said, "Because you 
walked into here.  What are you doing here?"  
And I said, "Okay, I don't what you are, but call 
Colonel Bouvet imme diately in such-and-such 
unit," and I gave him the phone number," and tell 
that I'm with you."  And he said, "Colonel 
Bouvet, how do know him? "  And I said, "But I know hi m."  And then I looked at him and I said, 

"Are you from that unit?"  And he said, "Sure.
"  And I said, "You were the people who were 
supposed to protect me  and you arrest me ? "   And 
he said, "But you were not walking on the right 
little passageway.  You were walking one below.
"  You know, they are on the hill, there are 

several.  And in the night, the 
guide took me  there.  He was an 
Alsatian from the Barrier, but in 
the night he ma de a mi stake and put me  on the 
wrong passageway.  So I was arrested and then 
the Germans saw it because they were just a few 
paces away, but they di dn't  do anything.  They 
want to see what was going on, and they took me  
back to the headquarters where I was debriefed 
and I told them what everything 
I saw which was very important th
ings I saw.  Where resist ance 
was -- do you know, where the Germans had posts in
 our area where they were watching us and 
reporting.  But it was such a big mountain, you can have a lot of things.  So I gave all the 

information, but I was terribly upset that I had been 
arrested by the French.  And top of it, I could 
have been shot.  They were absolutely ready to 
do it if I hadn't  defended myself.  But I had been 

told how to react to people, you know, what to 
do in case I was in danger.  That was one the 
premiums you get, how you survive in such cases. 
 So I came back -- first, I was debriefed by 
another unit and by intelligence, and 
then I went back to Colonel B
ouvet.  After that they tried 13 
times to ma ke me  cross, 13 other time s.  Th
at was bungled purposely, but the Captain who was 

the chief of the unit who took me  there, he could not accept that his mi ssion was not done right.  

So he said that I got confused and went on the wr ong passageway.  And I had a terrible fight 

with him, and I said absolutely
 not.  And the guide said, "Look, that's  enough.  No, I ma de the 
mi stake."  So that was okay, but the Captain and 
I, we were not on the best terms after that.  
Okay.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
64 
 
Q: Did you and this officer have a . . . 
A: Yeah.  Right.  But after that I tried 13 times to
 cross, and the second time they let me go in a 
big field and they were shooting, you know, tracers 
all over.  And it was night, it was always at 
night, and that was perhaps a week
 later or 10 days later.  And then they let me  go and they go 
this way, but they didn't give me  any indicati
on, do you know, a real indicat
ion what I should do, 
and then you will find the Germans.  And I walked
 around at night, I walked in circles.  And I 
heard dogs barking everywhere, but I didn't 
know where the dogs were, you know.  And I 
walked in circles, and they didn't tell me  there 
wa s a canal there.  And I fell in the canal, never 

even caught a cold, nothing, I walk
ed all the rest of the night 
in my wet clothes and I never 
caught a cold.  There was -- you 
know, you live under such hype th
at nothing happens to you.  
But anyway, I walked all morning -- all ni ght, an
d couldn't find my way because there was snow, 
there was a canal.  There was dog barkings and 
I didn't know where to go.  They had not given 
me  good indications what road to go, how to do it. 
 And toward the morning when it started to be 
light, I saw a whole unit of tanks 
with soldiers comi ng on the road 
a little fa r away.  Quite fa r 
away.  And I thought it was the Germans, so I wa
lked toward them.  And when I approached, 
they were speaking French.  So they were -- so 
I was -- but these ones did 
not try to harm me.  
Because immediately the officer took me asid
e and said, "What are 
you doing here?"  And I 
explained to him, and he  got in touch with my
 uni t and they came  and got me .  But 12 more 

times -- but most of the time  it was very bad.  
One night they wanted 
me  to cross the River 
Rhine, swimmi ng in wintertime .  I would have died
 of hyperthermia before I crossed even half of 
the river.  It was so stupid, I 
said, "That is impos sible."  Any 
girl would not survive such a 
swimming.  That is impossible, I couldn't explain that I'd do that. 
 No German could believe so 
much, you know, that the girls would swim in plainwinter through Rhine.  So I said that I didn't 

accept.  And then the 15th time or the 13th time -- I think it's the 15th time , I finally ma de it.  But 

that was well organized -- well, I was sent to Germany through Switzerland.  And it's a Swiss 

agent who picked me  up.  I was taken by my unit 
to Basel, you know, to 
Switzerland?   And in 
Basel, I was me t by a Swiss agent who took me  to 
Sachsenhausen which is not very far.  And in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
65 
 
Sachsenhausen there is a little encl
ave, the German road passes near a field which is Swiss, and 
there is a little -- I reme mber how 
it looked and there was a forrest to
 the left.  The road in front 
of us and to the right was a little
 enclave -- is a fence.  And the Sw
iss spent all day with me there, 
and he was -- for me , was an old ma n.  He was 
God know, he was near his 50s, perhaps late 40s.  
For me , he looked very old.  And he said to me , 
"Listen, you are surely going to die.  Why don't  
we sleep together?  Why don't we ha ve a good time ? "   And I told him, "Why don't  you go and 
jump in the river?  But I'm not going to do su
ch a thing."  I had no 
intention of dying and no 
intention of sleeping with him. 
 And he cried, but -- and then he
 told me -- but he was very 
decent in that way.  He did not assault me  or a
nything.  He tried verbally to entice me , and his 
way of enticing me  was not very enticing anyw
ay.  But anyway, towards the evening, towards 
dusk, I lie down in the field very close to the 
road.  And I had white knee socks on, and I had the 
impression that the whole German Army could 
see my white socks, do 
you know?   You wouldn't 
believe in what terror I was.  It was absolute 
terror, I could not move.  And I think how did I -- 

what did I get into such a predicame nt?   How 
can I do it?  I cannot do it.  And I stayed there 

quietly, I couldn't bring myself to do it.  And at on
e point, I said I have to do it.  No way.  And I 
reme mbered that that Captain w
ho was Captain Mollet, M-o-l-l-e-
t, had said that I had bungled 
because I had got confused.  And that ma de me  
do it, and when I came back, I told him that.  
Boy, was he feeling -- was he embarrassed.  In 
front of everybody I told
 him of the whole, you 
know, all the officers of the unit.  But anyway, 
I finally stood up, walked to the road and there 
were two Germans, sentinels, who were crossing each
 other.  So I walked to -- but were never -- 
you know, I waited until I see th
at, and I walked there and I met him.
  I said, "Heil, Hitler."  And 
he said, "Where are you going? "   I said, "To Hels
inger," which was a city there, or  a little town 
very close.  I don't reme mber how big that was, ve
ry close to that, walkin
g distance, but at night 
and I walked there and he didn't bother me .  He di
dn't ask for papers, nothing.  But I had identify 
papers of the German __________, and my na me was 
Marthe Ulrich, U-l-r-i-c-h.  Unfortunately, 
I lost all these papers, I don't know
 where they are.  They mu st be some where, but I don't know 
where.  I looked for them, and I didn't find them
.  And I had these papers
, and I had coupons for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
66 
 
food and all kinds of things.  A
nd I had all places where to go.  The first one was in Sink, that's  
why I walked to Sink.  And it was a young -- 
somebody gave me  a recommendation for that 
fa mily, but they never knew who I was and wh
at I was doing.  But I knocked at the door, it was 
quiet, it was 10 o'clock.  Knocked at the door, 
and they opened -- the woma n opened the door.  
Her husband was in the Ar my . . .   
Q: Some thing was moving around , or -- 

A: Wa s it?  

Q: How ma ny mi nutes left?   Why don't you begin you 
were going to live with this family in 
Sink.   

A: Oh, yeah.  I knocked at the door and she ope
ned the door, and she said, "Who are you?"  And 
I told her that such-as-such person -- I don't 
remember who i t  was -- recommended me, who was 
a good friend of hers.  That he had told me  that 
I could come  to her house and get a room there.  
That she would, you know, take me  in.  And she di
d and she was very nice about it.  And the 
next day, she said to me, "I notice" -- because un
derneath my  socks, my white socks, I had silk 
socks, you know.  She noticed they
 were all torn.  "What happened 
to you?"  And she said to me , 
"Did you . . . 

Q: We  need to stop the tape.   

A: She had noticed that my silk
 -- at that time, we had no pant
yhose, but silk stockings were 
completely torn.  So she said to me , "What happe
ned?"  I said, "I fell,"because Helsinger was -- 
and she told me , you know, " We have so 
ma ny worries about spies comi ng over from 
Switzerland, when I saw your torn socks, stockings,
 I was afraid of some t hing like that."  And I 

start laughing and said, "Do I look li
ke a spy? "  No, I had to absolutely get out of that.  And she 
said, "No, really you don't ."  And I said, "Don't 
worry.  I'm not one.  I'm a good Germa n."  So 

that's  how I got out of that.  So
 I stayed with them about two or
 three days, and then by train, I 
went to Freiburg which is northwest
 of Helsinger, and that's  not t
oo far from the Rhine, Freiburg.  
And that's in Germany, not in Switzerland, but th
ere's a Fribourg in Switzerland.  And I arrived 
in Freiburg, and there I had an address, too, 
to go where a young Alsati
an doctor who had been

in Germany had lived with that fami l y, with a 
ma n and woma n.  And he -- they were very good 
friends, and he told me to -- oh, I never met him.  
 But soon my unit, I knew that he accepted to 
send me  there.  So I said I came from him, and I 
had papers from hi m.  I had some  proof that he 
had, you know, that I had a husband.  That he had 
written me  a letter or some thing.  So they 
accepted me  very well, and they never questione
d me.  And -- but I had another addr ess in 
Freiburg of the doctor who was Alsatian, and his 
father was in ______ and he asked -- he knew 
that some body was going to go to Germany on a mi ssion.  And he asked if they would go and 
see him so that he can help me  so he can possi
bly return to Fr ance.  Because he had ma rried a 
German woma n and stayed in Germany.  He was Al
satian.  And I went to see him, and that was 
terrible fiasco.  Because the guy absolutely -- he sa
id, "I am married to German."  I told him, I 
was told to tell hi m what I was doing there.  Bu
t his father -- I didn't m
eet his father again, the 
father gave the instructions that what I should tell
 him.  And I told him, 
"I will help you go back 
to France.  You know, the war will be soon over.  It
's just a question of da ys now, and I can help 
you go back to France if you help me .  Give me  i nfor mation about what's going on here.  

Military information."  And he said to me , "O
h, how can I do that?   I'm ma rried to a German 

citizen.  I cannot do that, absolutely."  And then 
he said, "Where are you staying? "  And I said, "I 
have no address yet.  I have not found yet anywhere
 to stay.  I am going to
 probably travel right 
away."  I was afraid of him, I was terrified.  I wa
nted to get out of there,
 so I got out as soon as 
possible and took all kinds of tours to ma ke 
sure that I'm not followed.  But I was never 
followed.  And when the French Army came in Frei
burg later, quite later, he looked for me  and 
wanted me  to help him go back to France.  But I 
did not accept to meet him, I refused because he 
had not helped me .  He was very atrocious, he 
would have had arrested me , had he known where 
to find me .  I understood that, and I stayed away from hi m.  But I found other people who helped 

and they would give me  information.  The girls,
 Alsatian girls were in the German Army and 
were dying to go home .  And, you know, I could tell th
em that I can help them go home, if they 
help me .  And that was a great help.  It was th
e last few weeks of the war.  Three weeks, two 

weeks, I don't  re me mber exactly.  Three weeks 
about.  When I  came to Ge rmany, I think I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
68 
 
there about three weeks.  But -- and then in Fr
eiburg, I had another address to go outside of 
Freiburg to a certain pl ace I cannot reme mber, whic
h extremely close to the Siegfried line.  And 
the last village near the Siegfrie
d line.  You could just walk th
ere, 300 yards and you were in the 
Siegfried line.  And I went to th
at doctor, there wa s another doctor
 who I was told to go to.  But 
he wasn't  home, and his wife, which was probably very good, but the ma id, they fed me  because 
I was hungry.  I was walking all the time , and I di
dn't know where to stop, so I was afraid.  But 
when she asked me , " Would you like some thing to eat?"
 I said, "Yes," when 
I told her I want to 
see her empl oyer.  But walking towards that vill
age, I was with a group of people.  Wo me n and 
there was one non-commissioned officer, an SS, li
ttle guy, too.  Very li
ttle guy.  And he was 
talking about, you know, all the 
things the SS do.  How much they do and how they hate the 
Jews and how they hate the Poles and how they
 hate the Russians and what they do to these 
people.  He was talking openly a
bout it, and then suddenly he fain
ted.  He was comi ng back, he 
told us that he had been wounded and just came
 back to Zurich, and he fainted.  And I was a 
German nur se, so I took care of him.  So when 
he came back to it, he was very grateful, you 
know, that I had been so nice to hi m.  And we b
ecame best friends, even if he told me that he 
could smell a Jew at miles; he had told me.  And he told me any time I want to come to the 

Siegfried line to visit him, he would be delight
ed and he would introduce me  to all his friends.  

And he gave me  his address and told me  how to 
get there.  So the day -- I was Freiburg a few 
days, but then I went back some where else, but I 
cannot reme mber.  I traveled and I was in a bus 
one day.  And in that bus -- but that was in the 
Offenburg.  I think that was near, not too far from 
Freiburg, but just a distance.  Because I was afra
id to take trains, and I went, you know, I went 
with military transpor ts.  But they took you, as they
 took the civilians be cause they knew that it 
was very little -- there was very
 little communication.  You couldn'
t travel very easily.  And the 
Americans were always bombarding, but I was 
so lucky before I entered the city, they 
bombarded the city.  When I left, they started bo
mbarding the city.  But I 
was there, I was never 
under bombardme nt of the Americans, which was good because boy, did they destroy things.  

And then I went to that Offenburg, and I wa
s in a bus going some where and -- because the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
69 
 
transport had told me  to say goodbye to the south, to go up the Swiss border where I wa nted to 
go.  But they took me  to Offenburg to a complete
 different section.  And we were in the -- I 

reme mber now.  We wer e in the truck all night
, and it was freezing.  You know, on the bed of the 

truck in the back, it was freezing.  We were absolute
ly frozen.  It was in wi nter in Germany in 
the forrest, and we arrived early morning in a 
place where the convoy stopped.  So we went out 
of the convoy.  There were seven civilians, and we 
were lying in the fields.  And then planes 
came over, American planes, but they didn't bombar
d.  I was there, so they didn't bombard.  And 

I fell asleep there, I was so tired
 that I fell asleep.  And suddenly more planes came  by, so they 
shook me  up.  You know, the people around me  s hook 
me  to awake me .  And I was so surprised 
and I didn't know where I was, and I started to answ
er in French.  That was quite a thing.  When 

I realized they were looking at 
me  very strangely, and I said in five mi nutes I'm arrested.  So I 
got up and said I needed to go to the bathroom 
and I run.  And I run to a hole, and I find the 
milkma n who came by with the horse and wagon.  A
nd I stopped him and he took me  to the next 
city.  And that's how I escaped, but I would have 
been arrested because they looked at me  very 

strangely.  They had to think what they were 
going to do next.  But that was the only time where 
I awoke and spoke French, but it's very difficu
lt not to.  And then I took another bus, I don't 
reme mber exactly, do you know, the sequence.  Bu
t I know I was in another bus, and there was 
only one non-commissioned officer in that bus
.  And all the rest 
were wome n, and that 
commissioned offi cer started to tell how they trea
ted Russians and Poles in the East.  They were 
not talking about Jews, that how they treated th
e Russians and the Poles.  How they assembled 
the whole people, all the people from one village. 
 Put them in a square, and start shooting them 
with machine guns.  It's the ach me in, you know, the Germans speak like that.  Ach me in, and 

slap the side ma ny times  and say,"You should have
 seen running like litt
le mi ce."  It was 
horrible.  And I thought that, 
and everybody -- all the 
wome n laughed.  They felt that was very 
funny.  And I had to laugh with them, I had no ch
oice.  So I didn't laugh too much, but I had to 
laugh some .

Q: Okay. 
A: One point I wanted to ma ke is that always
 the German afterwards, after we won the war, 
always pretended that they did not know, and that's absolutely not true.  They knew it because  

the soldiers came home and they told the stor y.  Th
ey told about all these ba
rbaric things.  I head 
it, I was there only three weeks a
nd I heard it.  And how could th
e people who lived there all the 
time not hear it?  And I didn't know the people w
ho told me  then.  So they boasted about it 
openly, so that's a big myth that's the Germans di d not know.  And I have friends who were in a 

concentration camp, a young Alsatian, who was late
r in our unit.  And he said -- he was in 
Dachau or Buchenwald, I don't reme mber.  And he 
said that when they were taken out on walks 
to go to the work site every da
y, there were skeletons, all these 
people.  And there were barely 
walking, and people in the town would throw stone
s at them and beat them.  On top of -- do you 
know, all the other brutalities?   
So these were town people, and 
they all said, "Oh, we did not 
know."  You know, one German one  day recognized what the Germans di d to me , and I shook 

his hand.  I said, "You are the only honest German 
I ever me t."  It was unbelievable that they 
absolutely denied the horrible th
ings they all knew they had done
.  It was no secret.  It was 
impossible to have a secret.  So I think that poin
t is very important.  Okay, now I go back to my 
story.  I don't know where I am. 

Q: We ll, you had been to the Siegfried line.  You had traveled on a bus . . . 

A: Yeah.  Then I came back to Freiburg, and I h
ope that the French were comi ng that day.  I 
knew they were getting close because -- and ther
e Germans wi th bazooka in corners, you know 
at every place where they coul
d hide a little bit and waiting fo
r the French.  And I went around, 
and I was such a good German, and I said, "O
h, my God.  I hope not
hing will happen to you 
because you don't know, do you realize I saw them comi ng fr om up there?   They ha ve  enormous 

tanks comi ng."  They have no more tanks, they have nothing, the German tank in Freiburg.  So 

most of them got down from their post, they got fr
ightened because I told them that.  And then I 
was in the ma in street when the first tank came. 
 French tank -- no, yeah, French.  They were the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
71 
 
French.  And I ma de the V sign like that and stoppe
d it, and I asked that th
e officer come  down.  
They had quite a few Germans, prisoners, on the 
tank all over.  And I told him, "Please come  
down, I need to talk to you."  And I took him aside 
and I told him, "I a m he
re.  I am part of the 
Ar my.  I'm in the intelligence.  I 
need to see -- to be taken to th
e headquarters right now.  I need 
to go there because I have very important informa tion to gi ve them.  And he took me and I met 
Commander  Petit, Petit, who was the chief -- he 
was comma nder or colonel, I don't reme mber, of 
the second Division Zaire, that was the regime nt
.  And that was, too, a regime nt from North 
Africa.  And Colonel Petit first was a little leer
y about me , you know, when
 he start to question 
me .  And he  was -- he didn't believe me .  He 
thought I was ma king up s t ories and then he start 
questioning me .  He had been in intelligence, 
and I told him what information I had, who to 
contact, how to contact and then ended story 
and I was okay.  So I told him the impor tant 
information I had.  That day, I had gone back to
 Siegfried line to see my good friend, the little 

SS, who had invited me  to come  because I want to
 see what's  going at that Siegfried line.  And 
when I arrived at the Siegfried line and I inqui
red about him, they were all leaving.  The 
Siegfried line was emptying, the French came 
down, not south but west -- no, east of the 
Siegfried line.  They did not wa
nt to deal with the Siegfr ied 
line, but my infor mation was the 
Siegfried line  was empty, not to worry about 
it.  So that was extremely important  military 

information right then and there.  So Colone
l Petit believed me and he sent out, you know, 
patrols and they found out that theSiegfried line was empty.  So afte
r that, he really believed me .  
And I was very well treated, and he said to me , 
"Do you want me  to send you back to your unit?  
I know where they are located."  He had gotten 
in touch with them to tell them I was safe, 
because they didn't know, didn't have any news fr
om me.  And I told hi
m, "No, my mi ssion isn't 
finished.  I ha ve to go back south."  Because
 they were comi ng not south.  The south, nobody 
was there yet.  So I said, "I go back south 
tomorrow morning, but I will ask you a favor.  Find 
me  a bicycle because I'm tired of walking."  So
 he  found me  a bicycle, and the next morning I 

left.  And I have papers where he said that for 
that night, to protect 
me if somebody attacks me 
and to go through the French line.  And he said, "Destroy these papers you arrive."  After the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
72 
 
French went, I never destroyed it.  I still ha
ve them.  You know, saying that I should be 
protected.  But under the name  of Lelotra.  He
, too, didn't know my real name , nobody did.  So I 
left the next morning and we
nt south towards the mountains
.  And when I climbed up the 
mountains in the Black Forest, it was quite hi
gh.  And at one point, I was just pushing my 
bicycle, I couldn't ride it.  It was muc h too in
cline, steep.  So a German sol dier was walking 
there.  There were always soldiers all over walking, they didn't know where to go because they 
didn't know where their units were.  
They were completely disorganized by then.  So he said to 
me , "I push your bike."  So I let him,  he pushe
d my bike up the mountains.  What do I care?   
Well, I don't need to do that, so I let him.  And we
 talked and I always talked to them that I was 
looking for that fiancé who was lost, do you know th
at?   I didn't know where he was.  I always 
used that, and I told him that I had run awa
y.  And I told that everybody when I got out of 
Freiburg, when I went south, everybody I me t fr
om the Army, I told them what horrible 
experience that was to see the French Ar my w
ith black people.  Would you believe that they 
have black soldiers and a lot of them and they lo
ok terrible?  And they'r
e barbaric, I made a big 
story.  They were all terrifie
d, you know, because they had not more organization.  They were 
not structured anymore, they had no real defense.
  And they were not go
ing to get killed for 

nothing, so the best thing was to 
do that and I did a good job at that.  And I told them -- and then 
I went south toward the border because there I ha
d a family I wanted go to see just near the 
Swiss border.  But that was the 
brother-in-law of the daughter, of
 one of the daughters of that 
fa mily was in our unit.  And he told me  that 
I can absolutely trust them, not to worry.  They 
wouldn't even know, they knew already that I wa
s going to come .  So they knew all about me , 
and they knew that I was from the French Ar
my.  They were very Catholic, Bavaria -- no, 
Bedouins, you know, fr om Baden fr om the territory of
 Baden and they were very anti-Hitler.  So 
I went to their house, but before I arrived th
ere, I me t a whole group 
of ambulances who were 
comi ng from the north going south, too, and east.
  Because once you arrived to south, you have 
to go east.  You go into [Brest] along the Rhine.  
And I asked them what they were doing there, 
and I told them how terribly unha
ppy I was that Fr eiburg was taken by these horrible Fr ench and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
73 
 
all these blacks and all that I repeated.  They told
 me , "Don't worry.  It's here, not far."  They told 
me exactly where, in the forest there is a whol
e division hidden in the 
forest and they are going 
to beat them.  And they told me  the name s a
nd they told me  who they were.  You know, they 
were so convinced I was such a good German.  A
nd then, I knew that it was imperative to go to 
that house of the Swiss and to get that information 
to my partner as fast 
as possible.  That was 
vital, and I had no radio.  I had nothing, the only 
way I was told that I can give important and, 
you know, rapidly information was to go to the Swiss 
and tell them that I'm a Swiss agent.  And 
that's what I intended to do, so I 
arrived -- I traveled a
nd it was quite a distance.  So at night, very 
late at night, I arrived in a vi
llage, in a square of the villag
e.  And for some reason I never 
understood, I sat on a bench and I didn't feel like 
going anywhere.  And in a few mi nutes a ma n 
came by and asked me where I was -- what I was doi
ng there.  And I told him that I came  from 
Freiburg, that I escaped the French
 Ar my and told him about all that.  And then he said to me , 
"Don't go this way because you are going to be bothere d.  There is a patrol 
there, and they bother 
everybody.  They are really a hard group."  Boy, 
I was very happy to have stopped there.  Do 
you know, I had always an instinct 
I cannot go.  And then he told me
, "Go to that house near the 
square.  They are very nice people, and they will 
give you a bed."  So I went and they really did, 
they give me  a bed.  And I slept there, but very
 early in the morning I 
told them I had to be 
getting up.  And I told them the sa me story, 
I always told everybody the same  story.  Their 
husbands were prisoners of war, and they no news. 
 Or they were killed, they had no news.  But 
anyway, I left the next morning very early and ro
de to that Swiss border, to that place where I 

was going.  And I arrived late in the afternoon.  It 
took quite a -- it's  quite a distance.  And I had 
to write that letter for keeping 
all that information, and I had no time to do it in code.  So I just 
wrote and the next morning at dawn, the two gi
rls took me  to the border which was just a few 
hundred yards away.  And they were -- you know, be
tween the German a nd Swiss, and they told 
me , "Go thr ough the barbed wire."  And they he
lped me  go through.  "The n turn left and you will 

see a building, that's the Swiss Cu
stom House."  But like ma ny people, left and right, they didn't 

know the difference.  So I crossed the barbed wi
re, went up left and then
 I saw the building and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
74 
 
knocked at the door.  It was -- and nobody answer
ed when I looked in, and I saw swastikas; it 
was a German Custom House.  Luckily they were
 sleeping, they didn't hear me .  And here my 
letter in my left  pocket with my 
hand on it, I reme mber that so we
ll.  And from far away I turned 
around and said, "Oh, my God.  I'm in the German Customs."   And I saw from far away behind a 
tree a Swiss guy ma king big swings
 like that, so I run towards him.  But the Germans never 

woke, because they could have killed me .  I run towards the Swiss, and he pulled me  behind the 

tree and said, "What are you doing? "  It was 
a Swiss Germa n, he spoke German onl y, but I 
understand him.  You know, he spoke more German
 than Swiss Germa n to me .  And I said to 
him, "I'm Swiss intelligence.  I am in the Swiss in
telligence , and that letter has to be  in Basel at 
such-and-such office in such-and-such's  hands befo
re 11 o'clock this morning."  And he saluted 
me , he said, "It will be done."  And it was done, 
and the Swiss took all the 
information first, they 
always did.  And then they give it 
to my unit, and that's  one of the 
things that is written in one of 
my citations, that I had given that information.  
And that was very important information, and it 
saved ma ny lives.  And then the Swiss said, "What 
do you want to do? "   And I said, "I return."  
He said, "Oh, my, you really want to return there?" 
 And I said, "I am not finished," so I returned 
to Germany to that house, but the Germans ne
ver saw me .  I don't know how that happened.  

What I told you, I'm extremely lucky.  And I went
 back to the house and I stayed that day, and 
the next morning, I went -- no, the same  a fternoon with
 my bi ke, I went west -- east.  I went east 

to see what was going on because I knew they were 
comi ng not south, this way, so I went east to 
see what was going on this way.  And when I arrive
d at a certain small town, there were a lot of 
soldiers, of German sol diers.  A whole division 
of them.  And I stopped and talked to them and 
told them, you know, always my story how I ha
d escaped from Freiburg, from these horrible 
French.  And I said, "What are 
you doing here?"  And they said, 
"Oh, this night we are all going, 
the whole division is going to go across into Switzer
land.  Because we want to go to Austria, and 
we would cross Switzerland."  Then I went b ack along that road, you know, in the south and on 

the west.  And I met -- I arrived in the village 
very close to this -- you 
can go any mor e  west, do 
you know?   To the end of the road, before you go up nor
th.  So I went out of there with my bike, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
75 
 
and when I arrived in the village, there were 
white flags all over.  And the me n said, "Don't go 
any further.  The French are there in the square
."  And I said, "Oh, I am not  going to go toward 
them, no wa y."  And I run to meet them, and the Germans we re horrified when they saw that I 
was going to them, when I just said, "Oh, don't worry
 about it."  They were, but they couldn't do 

anything; they were civilians, they we re not Ar
my people.  And the French imme diately I went 

to, to the officer.  He was si
tting in a Jeep, and I say, "I 
want you to take me  to your 
headquarters."  Always the same  thing.  A
nd he said to me , "Why would you go to the 
headquarter?"  I say, "I need to go to the headquar ters and talk to your officer."  And then I saw 

an insignia on his uniform, and I said, "You 
are a second _______, aren't  you? "   And he said, 
"Yes," that was the same unit I had me t in Freibur
g.  I said, "Then take me  to Colonel Petit."  

And he took me , and Colonel Petit, I don't re me mber
 what he was, but Petit was extremely to see 
me  again.  And then I gave him the rest of the information and I told him,  "You see, if you go 

east now, at that village is a whole division, but th
is night they will go over to Switzerland."  So 
he sent me  immediately with the Jeep to the Ge
neral, who was a general with one Army, he had 
one Army a nd Petit.  And he was called __________.  That was his -- he always said 

___________, which me ans there are no Germans .  And I was brought to him, and I told him my 

information.  And he looked at me , he didn't -- 
nothing was important to
 him.  He wouldn't 
believe me  or I don't know what.  But anyway, 
he did not use my infor mation, and he gave 
orders to attack these Germans, and there were
 several dead on our side and wounded.  And on 
their side and it was absolutely a 
waste of time.  And then the ne
xt night -- no, it was that night, 
they really went into Switzerland.  But you know 
what the Swiss did?   The next mo rning, they 
gave them all back to as prisoners.  They didn'
t want them to cross Switzerland.  We  were too 
close now.  The Swiss have always 
worked all sides, but at that 
point, they did not wa nt to do it 
because we were too close to the end of the wa
r.  And we winning, so they had nothing to do 
with the Germans anymore.  They had helped the 
Germans ve ry much before, but that's the gist 
of the story.  Then I me t Colonel Petit and I stay
ed with that unit until th
e liberation.  Then after 
that, I rejoined my unit.  So th
at's how the war -- my mi ssion ended. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
76 
 
Q: It sounds very exhausting. 
A: What? 

Q: Very exhausting.  I don't know how you 
kept up that momentum.  All by yourself? 
A: You are not tired.  You are not tired.  You ar
e not cold, you can take if for hours when you are 
hyped up.  It's  a complete different -- do you know, 
I told you I fell in th
e canal, and I was not 
even, I never even got a cold.  
And in plain winter, when all cl
othes were frozen on me.  When 
the Army found me, they give me uniforms, do 
you know, of me n to change because I was so I 

was absolutely drenched.  I had clothes -- and 
I never caught a cold or got sick.  So you live 
under different conditions.  It's  a complete different world.  If you ma de me  do that now, I would 

die.  I wouldn't  be able to.  So . . . 

Q: An a mazing story.  You accomplished quite a b
it on your own.  Were you -- did you ever feel 
terribly isolated or . . .  

A: Yeah, but the mi ssion was so important to 
me .  Once I had the courage to go through, then 
everything was forgotten.  I onl
y thought about the mi ssion and wh
at I wanted to do.  And I 
wanted to do it the best possibl
e -- I found prisoners of war, Fren
ch prisoners of war who gave 
me  infor mat ion.  Do you know I tried to get in
formation from whoever could give me  some  
information?   That's what they say, that 
I built a Reseau, you know, a group of infor mation. 
Q: And your fa mily didn't know about this? 

A: Oh, no.  Nothing, nothing.  They absolutely 
had no inkling.  During the whole time I was in 
Germany, I had written letters in advance dated on
ce a week, and the letters were sent to them by 
one of my friends.  They were ab
solutely -- they had absolutely no 
idea.  When I told them, they 
couldn't believe it.  They believed me
, but they we re very surprised. 
Q: You stayed in the Fr ench Army? 

A: Yes, I went to Vietnam after.  Oh, first I st
ayed, I was awarded.  They had promised me  a lot 
of things.  And we were first in Constance, my 
unit was fi rst in Constance, which is a city on the 
Lake of Constance, not far from Switzerland.  And 
there I had to live in th
e same  building as the 
captain I talked to before.  And after a few days
 when it was absolutely verboten to have any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374

relationship with the Germans, and I didn't feellike having any relationship with the Ge rmans.  
You know, s ocial relationship.  He invited 
Germans who were businesspeople who he was 
trading with them.  God knows what.  But he
 was ma king business with them, he was an 
Alsatian.  And he obliged us all to a dinner with 
the Germans, and I got up -- when they came  in, 
I got up and left.  That's another thing to talk abou
t.  No ma n could have done that.  So he put me  
in arrest, you know.  I had to stay in my room, 
and then he wrote me  a note that I had to be 
shipped back to France.  That he didn't  want me
 anymore, and I was not going to accept that.  So 
I called the Colonel Bouvet, who was not too far 
away.  His headquarters 
was not too far away.  
And i mme diately he sent a Jeep for me , and with
 it I under arrest but I 
left.  And I went to 
Bouvet, and Bouvet called the supe
rior of that captain in our 
department.  I knew him,  but I 
could not call him.  So Bouvet called him and as
ked him to get -- to receive me, that I had 
some thing very important to him.  So he im
me di ately accepted, and I was driven by a chauffeur 
off to Bouve t with a Jeep to that place.  And 
I told that commander, that ma jor what happening.  
He was an Alsatian, too, and a friend of the cap
tain, but he was horrified.  And he said to me , 
"You know, in you papers, in your file is a note th
at I will never forget.  That after having been 
in so much danger and doing all what you did, you 
refused the financial reward."  And at that 
time we really needed it, because my brother 
ha d eaten up all his savings, you know, for keeping 
the whole family alive during the whole war.  But 
I couldn't be paid for such a war, so he said 
that's in your file.  And after that he has done th
at to you?   And then he punished him.  He was 
demoted and sent away from Constance, which wa
s a ma rvelous city.  And I was put in another 
unit.  I was transferred to anothe
r unit where I was very happy.  And that in Linz.  I was in Linz, 
my unit was a little outside of Linz.  They were 
living in the villa of -- 
what's his name.  Not 
Hi mmler, but one of the big chiefs, you know, of 
German Nazis.  Above th
e Constance, it's still 
the Constance Lake, but that was at the other side
 in Bavaria near Austria.  Near the Austrian 
border.  So I was in that place for quite a while,
 and they awarded by ma king me  the chief of the 
department where every German wanted to 
come  into French Bavaria had to ask my 
authorization.  And I organized th
at exactly like the Germans had or
ganized in France.  I learned 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
78 
 
from the m.  They had to be fingerprinted, they had 
to give me  a picture, and at the same  ti me  that 
work was a front for intelligence work that I wa
s continui ng to do.  And the intelligence work, 
which is not very nice as allies, was to se
nd people to investigate what was going on in the 
British, the American and the Russian 
sector s.  And we all did it, they di d it to us; we did it to 
them.  In Landau when I was in that departme nt
, one day the French police came and arrested my 
secretary, a German who was an agent of the Amer
icans.  You know, so we were back and forth, 
you think that's intelligence if you never see it. 
 And our lives are not the lives you do that, you 
do these things. 

Q: We ren't you honored by the French Army?  

A: Yeah, I had two citations.  I 
had really -- I had applications for three citations -- not my 
application.  But I was three time s, I was supposed
 to get citation.  I got two.  And that captain 
who had done the horribl e things to me  because of
 the Germans that he invited, he got a citation 
for my work at the hi ghest grade.  And he said 
to me, "You will get it, it's a silver medal, because 
nobody will give you mo re than that."   And I coul dn't 
care less at the time, but he got the highest , 

you know. 

Q: What were your citations? 

A: They are about my work.  Oh, they were
 __________, two quad a guerre (ph) from the Army.  
One was signed by General Schwin (ph), and theother one wa s signed by De Lapp (ph), General 

De Lapp. 

Q: You've been really gracious with your time.
  We 've been here a long time .  Maybe you can 
tell me  very briefly how you -- you know, what
 you did after the May 1945 end of the war. 
A: Yes.  Aft e r staying in Linz for several more months, in February of '4 6, I volunteered for 

Indochina.  And I went to Indochi
na where I stayed until Decemb
er '48, which is almost three 
years.  And I was first in Phnom Penh for eight
 or nine months.  Phnom Penh in Camb odia.  

Then I was in Da Nang arrived right after Ho 
Chi Minh started the revo
lt against the Fr ench, 
which started in December of '46, not  before.  Wh
en I went it was against the Japane se.  The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
79 
 
Japanese Army was still there, most of them were prisoners.  But we had a lot of snipers, and 
that's what we were fi ghting at  that  time until Ho Chi Men st arted this revolt in December. 

Q: We re you in nursing and intelligence? 

A: I was nursing, purely nursing.  No 
more intelligence, I needed to 
go back to reality.  I had a 
very swollen head, and it was not healthy.  And I 
wanted to lead a norma l life, go back to norma l 
life.  And that was the only way.  If I had stay
ed in intelligence, God knows what have happened 
to me . 

Q: So you thought going to I
ndochina was a normal life? 
A: Yes.  That was norma l life.  It was going back
 to my profes sion.  But 
I loved the Army, I was 
happy in the Ar my.  I felt it very interesting.  I fe
lt I did not want to ge
t married, I had decided -- 
I had absolutely decided after my fi ancé was kille
d that I would never get married until I met my 
husband.  I changed my mi nd.  But it took me  11 y
ears, pretty good.  But I went to Indochina and 
after Da Nang I was several months in Da Na
ng where the fighting was ferocious around Da 
Nang where it started.  The whole th
ing started there.  Then I wa
s sent for a whole year into 
Quang Tri, which was the DMZ.  And after that I 
went to Da Lat in the mountains.  That was a 

war, and I finished my time and then I came home
.  But in Quang Tri to go when we left Da 
Nang for Quang Tri, I became the head of the am
bulance.  It was not a march unit, because we 
were only team.  But we were a team going in th
e front where we were 
needed, and I organized 
that.  I was asked to organize that, and I f
ound all the equipment and all the supplies and 
everything.  I had to find it because the Army do
esn't like to give you things.  But that's how -- 
and then later I was in nursing in Da Lat in 
the mountains.  And then I came home in '48, in 
December '4 8 I came home.  And I lived first 
in Poitiers for until 1953, 
and in 1953 I went to 
Geneva in Switzerland where my ol der sister
 was living because sh
e had married a Swiss 
violinist of the Roman Orchestra.  And they invi ted me to join them, because my sister and I 

were very close and we are still very close. 
 And I went there and I 
became -- I entered nursing 
school to ge t the Swiss de gree.  Red Cross school, where I wa s very unhappy.  Because I was a 

French citizen, they ma de me  do all the cleaning.
  And the student nurses 
were doing the care of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
80 
 
patients and I was the cleaning woma n.  But I finally
 got my diploma, and then I worked in the 
hospital as a chief nurse, in the Departme nt of
 Ne urology for quite a while.  And I did other 
things in Geneva, and then when I met my 
husband in December of 1953.  And in '56, he had 
finished his studies, and he asked 
me  to come  with him to America, but we  were unma rried when 
we came.  I want first to see if I could adopt
 here.  And, you know, it was insured.  You come  to 
America, but God knows what happe
ns once you are here if we are going to get ma rried or not.  
But finally I went to -- first, I worked at Bethel  Israel Hospital  in Newark, New Jersey for six 
months to learn English and to ma ke a little mo
ney.  And then I went to school at Wa shington 
University to become  a nurse and in '58, I gradua
ted.  In August of '58, a
nd in January of '58 we 
got ma rried.  Because my husband came , he first wa
s an intern at Brooklyn Jewish in New York, 

and then he came to Wa shington as a resident. 
 And then when we first were able get both 
fellows then we got married in New York religiousl
y.  My mother came  to ma ke sure that we got 

ma rried by a rabbi.  And then we mo ved back to
 St. Louis.  After a while, we moved to New 
York, where I worked at New York Hospital an
d my husband worked at Memorial Cancer for 
the -- Memo rial Hospital for Cancer Research at
 Sloan-Kettering.  He 
was a resident and a 
fellow, and then we moved to Minneapolis where 
he did a ma ster's in biochemi stry.  And then 
we moved to Pittsburgh where he did a Ph.D. in
 biochemi stry, too, and nutrition and -- no, in 
Minneapolis, it was endocrinol ogy.  In Pittsburgh, it was biochemi stry and nutrition and public 

health.  And he got his Ph.D. and then he work
ed at the same hospital where I worked at the 
University Hospital at [Magee] Wo men's Hospital 
and I started to do res
earch with hi m.  I 
became his assistant in the lab.  He told me  
yes, you can do research because you are good in the 
kitchen.  You know how to cook, then you can do re
search, too.  I start re
search and we quite 
successful.  Then we came here. 

Q: To California? 

A: Yeah, to Los Angeles where we were offered 
by a for mer colleague a job at Martin Luther 
King Hospital, which is -- and Dr
ew Medical School.  And the f
our first years were tough, we 
were okay.  We did very good work and we were
 very ma rvelous with our research.  The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
81 
 
research was in anesthesiology, and, you know, how
 to make -- how anesthetic make you sleep, 
because nobody knows what sleep is.  And how you aw
aken, all this research.  And then we got 
in trouble, and we had to go to have -- we had 
two big trials, and we finally won the trial for 
discrimi nation, racial and religious discrimi natio
n.  Which was quite -- it took us nine years. 
Q: That you were discrimi nated against? 
A: Yeah.  By the black admi nistration.  Not the people we worked with, but the admi nistration 

and the school.  The administrati
on of the hospital and the school. 
 But we finally won, but last 
year.  It took us since '84. 

Q: And you had children . . . 

A: Yeah, yes.  I cannot forget that.  In 1960, 
I had the first son, Ste
phan, who is a doctor in 
Chicago.  And he's ma rried and has a little girl w
ho is three years old, Anna Regina.  His wife is 
Barbara.  And then in 1964, I had my second son, Benjamin, who you will see later here.  And he 

is an EMT, emergency me dical technician in 
San Diego.  He lives in San Diego.  So . . . 
Q: Let me  just ask you a couple of questions. 

A: Sure. 

Q: And then we'll introduce the family that 's here. 

A: Sure. 

Q: Your life was disrupted at a pr etty early age. 

A: Sure. 

Q: Do you have certain 
regrets, resentme nts? 
A: No, I never have.  I only re
gret that people were destroyed,
 but for my personal life I never 
regretted.  Because I went ahead, I never let it st
op me.  And my whole family was like that, they 
all, you know, did -- they all studied or did what
 they needed to do.  And the one who did the 
most sacrificing was my  oldest brother, Fre
d.  So -- because he supported the whole family. 
Q: What do you think gave you the strength to ac
complish what you did?  Did that come from 
your fa mily?   Wa s it . . . 

A: What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
82 
 
Q: What gave you the strength to accomplish al
l that you did in very difficult situations? 
A: Survival is a very strong ins
tinct, very strong.  That's  one th
ing, and revenge is another very 
strong instinct.  You know, I 
want really revenge.  I felt -- and I fe
lt that it as my duty to do it.  It 
was not only -- revenge was important, to get even 
for all the things we had been going through. 
Q: After having all these extrao
rdinary experiences, was it difficult to return to a more 
conventional lifestyle? 
A: Oh, yes.  Very much.  But with time , it wa
s okay.  But the beginning was very hard because I 

loved to be in the Army.  I had lots of friends, 
excellent friends.  And a whole group of friends.  
And they spoke highly of me , you know, because of
 what I did.  My reputation always followed 
me  wherever I went.  You know, there was al
ways some body who knew about what I had done, 
and they told everybody around them, I didn't.  
But when I went out and I had -- for certain 
things.  Usually, I didn't carry -- wear them much
.  But when I wore my decorations when I had 
to, that always ma de a big -- a big splash. 

Q: What were the di fficult adjustments? 

A: To just live norma lly.  You know, without the 
exciteme nt, without all the danger, without the 
adventures.  It was very adventur
ous to be in Vietnam, too, very.  Even as a nurse, and I loved 
the country.  It was a very interesting country.  I 
loved it.  And it was so different of what I had 
known before, and I took care a lot of natives.  B
ecause we were taki ng care of our soldiers, but 
we were taking care 
of the natives, too. 

Q: Can you talk for just a mi nute about what the 
long-term impact of all these experiences is? 
A: What is that? 

Q: What sort of a long-term i mpact these e
xperiences have had on you in terms of the way 
you've lived your life, in terms of your 
values or your fears or lack of them. 
A: Oh, fears, I have plenty of fears.  I hate 
the dark, I cannot stand da
rk.  And I don't deaths, you 
know.  I am afraid of these thi
ngs, and I don't hide it because I don'
t feel it's  i mportant.  And my 
values have not changed much.  I was very
 religiously brought up, but when I was 13 I 
absolutely revolted against everything.  My mot her
 said alwa ys that I was brandishing the red 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
83 
 
flag of revolt.  I was -- my older brothers 
and sisters didn't do that, they were much too 
respectful.  I was respectful to my pa rents, t
oo, but I was alwa ys revolting against what I thought 
was right.  Or when I raised my children, I rais
ed them religiously.  They went to religious 
school, I went with them 
to the temple.  I even went to lear
n He brew with them so I can help 
them with their homework.  I did all these things
, but I never pushed re
ligion down their throat, 
and I felt that I had -- you know, in my envi
ronment, religion was governing every mi nute of 
life.  And that, I felt, was too much when I wa
s a kid.  But I am, I wanted my children to be 
raised religiously.   
Q: Do you consider yours
elf religious today? 
A: I never know.  I don't  know.  It's very difficu
lt.  I think I believe in God, but I don't know how 
much.  I never knew.  Since I'm 13, I don't know.  
Before that I absolutely believed, but since 
then it's  diffi cult to know. 

Q: What about the traditions of Judaism?  

A: Oh, yeah.  I believe in traditions, absolutely. 
 And I believe  in Israel, and I believe, you know, 
in keeping the traditions we keep.  My husband
 is absolutely not religious; he was raised 
religiously.  But we keep all th
e holidays and we always have lived as a family, you know, in 
keeping the holidays.   

Q: Why don't  we introduce you husband . . . 

A: Sure. 

Q: . . . and son?   Why don't you stop tape
, okay?   Do you want to introduce them? 
A: Yes.  Behind me  to my right is my father, 
is [Captain Major] Al Cohn, my husband.  We  were 
ma rried in February of 194- -- no, 1958.  And 
here's my son, Ra mi e Benjamin, who was born on 
April 13th, 1964.  Is my  second son. 

HUSBAND: My wife has always been the strong me
mber of the fa mily.  Is her son, she'll tell 
you.  And he turned out fine, it's because of her.
  She has an inner strength, which has always 
been there.  And I think you h
eard it on the tape, as well. 
Q: We re either of you kind stunned by your
 mot her and wife's accomplishments? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
84 
 
HUSBAND: We ll, I knew very
 little about what she had done duri
ng the war.  I heard more after 
we were ma rried.  I knew she had come  back from
 Vietnam and that was really impressive.  And 
I was impressed that she took a strong position agai
nst the United States at that time , when she 
lived here enteri ng the war.  Telling them the resu
lts would be the same  as what happened to the 
French.  Rami e has been fine. 
SON: I knew even less than the little that he  did.
  I'm just now learning a lot about what she did.  
What she went through, what she experienced.  
And I must say it's all 
pretty amazing.  I'm 
impressed about the way things were handled as far as I know so far. 

Q: It's an extraordinary life. 

SON: More than what I'd want to go through, I must say.   

A: But you . . . 

SON: I'm not sure I'm strong enough to go through, so . . . 

A: It depends on the circumstances.  If you are th
rown in certain circumstances, you are going to 
go through what you never thought 
you could do, that's  all. 
HUSBAND: She did that as a family, too.  When we
 had extremely difficult time s, she was just 
as strong as all her experiences 
during the war.  And he put us
 through a lot of challenges, as 
well. 

SON: I thought this was about her.  

Q: . . . if you survived those, as well, you're all here. 

HUSBAND: Yes.  We 'r e only mi ssing my oldest 
son who lives in Chicago with his family. 
Q: Anything you all want to say? 

HUSBAND: No, I love my wife and sons. 

SON: We love our mother
, and that's  about . . . 
A: That's  true for me . 

HUSBAND: Short but sweet, what can we say? 

Q: Thank you all for patience. 

HUSBAND: Thank you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
85 
 
SON: Thank you. 
Q: Okay, we'r e just going to do this for a coupl
e mi nutes so we need silence except for your 
mother.  Wh at is this photograph? 

A: Oh, this is my grandfather, the Rabbi -- he was __________. 

Q: Do you know when this was taken, this photograph? 

A: I don't know.  I cannot reme mber, but it must be
 -- he died when he was about 78 from a heart 

attack.  He died suddenly.  That's -- I don't know 
when it was taken, but it wa
s in the later years.  
On the left on the horse is my for mer  fiancé, 
Jacques De la Rae (ph) 
who was killed.  He was 
tortured and shot by the Germans in 1942 in Octobe
r, I think October 6th, 1942.  Next to him is 
his brother, Mark, the last brot
her who was killed, shot the same  day with his brother and two 
other friends who had formed a group of resistan
ce against the Germans.  And they were caught 
and tortured first and shot later on the      Va
l-de-Marne in Paris.  This photograph must have 
been taken in the spring of 1942, but I can see leav
es, it must have been in the spring.  And the 
first -- I am not sure.  Okay, the first person to 
the right is our instruct
or, Ms. Valez (ph).  The 
next person to her is the dire
ctress of the school of Red Cro
ss, Ms. -- now, I cannot reme mber. 
Q: Is this in Marsei lles? 

A: I am next to her, and in the back -- in 
the back of my picture 
half-hidden is __________, the 
young lady who saved our life by making us come  
to her house before leaving the occupied 
France for unoccupied Fr ance. 

Q: This was in Poitiers? 

A: That's in Poitiers.  That was the Re d Cross School of Nursing which was in the hospital of the 

university, and the hospital 
was run by Catholic nuns. 
Q: You can't  point. 

A: No. 

Q: You can just tell us that you're in the mi ddle front. 

A: Yeah.  I am on the left of the Directress of th
e school who is much older than we are.  I am 
standing just left to her.  Th
is is my sister, Stephanie, who was deported on Yom Kippur Day 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0374  
86 
 
1942 to Auschwitz, and she never came  back.  She 
was a me dical student when she was arrested 
in Poitiers in July, end of June 1942.  And then 
she went to prison and to camp in Poitiers then 
Drancy and then Pithiviers. 
 And from Pithiviers, she wa
s deported to Auschwitz.
