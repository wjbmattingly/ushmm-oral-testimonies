Question: This is the United States Holoca
ust Museum, with Davi
d Rynecki, conducted 
by Judith Cohen, on July 6t
h, 2011, in Monroe Town ship , New Jersey. Let me start by 
asking you your name
 and date and place of birth.  
 
Answer: My  name is David Ry necki, RŠ
yŠnŠeŠcŠkŠi.  I was born March 23rd, 
1928, in Shedlitz.
 
Q: And can you give me the name of
 your parents and your siblings?  
 
A: My father's name is Irving Rynecki.  My
 mo ther's name is Szendla Rynecki.  In 
English, they called her Shirley Rynecki.  
And my  brother's name is Morrie Rynecki. 
 
Q: And can you give me their names when they
 were in Poland, the spelling of the names 
in Polish?  
 
A: The spellings for the name was the same 
thing, but instead of Irving, his name was 
Ezriel.  And my mother's name was Szendl
A:  And my  brother's name was Mosche.
 
Q: And let's start by talking a little bit about 
your life before the wa
r.  Can you describe 
your father's occupation and the type of scho
oling and the family lif
e you had before the 
war? 
 
A: Yeah.  My father's parents were bakers 
in Shedlitz.  And he wa
s born in 1900, also 
March the 23rd. Bu t he didn't lik
e the family because they were
 too religious for him, so 
when  he grew up, he didn't want to be a ba
ker, so he became a shoemaker. In 1923, he 
was trying to  avoid the Polish army , he went to
 Berlin, and he worked
 in Berlin for four 
or five years, approximately, as a shoemake
r.  He was making fancy shoes there. After Š
Š in 1928, he came back to Po land, and he
 married my  mother.  And I was born in 
 
1928.  After 1928, I was one years old, my fa
ther didn't  like living in Shedlitz, so we 
moved to  Aleksandrow Kujawski.  This was not 
far.  It's in Poland and ____.  The reason 
he moved there, because they
 found out over here he co
uld make a nice living making 
shoes and selling them to people that was from 
Poland.  So, when I ca
me there, I was one 
years old.  My father started a business 
____ ŠŠ well, actually, a Polish lady, because 
he was in business with my  mo ther, making the shoes and selling th em.  So, I was right 
behind most of the time, and I spoke Polish.  
We lived there 'til 1938. In 1938, after the 
Kristallnacht, most of the people were liv
ing ŠŠ there was only 150, 200 Jews, not too 
many Jews living th ere.  Most of them were
 Polk Deutsche living there.  1938 became 

very bad for us, so we had to leave Aleksand
row, and we went back to Shedlitz, came to 
Shedlitz.  So, my father's went to work for a sports factory.  They were making sport 

shoes for skiing, ice skating,
 and soccer, and soccer balls.
 
Q: And when your father was working, could you talk about the type of education, 
activities, h o bbies that yo
u and your brother had?
 
A: I had the same  education like I had in Al
eksandrow, because I was not used to Jewish 
life, because most of the Jewish
 kids lived, like, in a ghetto. 
 They had to go to Jewish 
schools.  They didn't  play with Polish kids. 
 They were afraid.  Th
ey were beaten up.  

They  couldn't go to swim.  They couldn't ride 
a bicycle.  They couldn
't play ball.  But I 
was used to that Polish life, so I register
ed myself, and I went to a school, to a 
 
Polish school for a year.  In that school, I b
ecame very popular beca
use I 'm a v ery good 
soccer player and a pingŠpong player, and a vo
lleyball player.  So, they kept me there 
good.  They treated me good.  Now, the 
war broke out in 1939.
  In 1939, when 
 
the war broke out, was terrible.  A ll the ŠŠ 
half of Shedlitz was bombed.  So, all my 
mother's relatives, most of them, got killed.  
So, they all moved in w
ith us.  So, they all 
lived with us in 
the ghetto, like for ŠŠ like ten 
people living in one room.
 
Q: Let's move back.  Before the ghetto
 was established, after the bombing ŠŠ
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: ŠŠ do they move in with 
you before the ghetto or ŠŠ
 
A: Sure.  They moved in before the ghetto, be
cause they have no plac
e left to live, so 
they slept in my house, over th
ere.  We slept on the floor.  
We slept on couches, because 
there was no mattresses in Europe.  In Europe
, a mattress was straw and a sack.  That was 
your mattress. And in th e ghe
tto, when it started, the ghetto
, they took away all the men 
right away, they took away. So, 
they took my father away, t
oo.  So, where he went, I did 
not know wh ere he went.  Or how he went, I didn't  know either.
 
Q: So, let's go back.  Let me
 step back a little bit before
.  From the period of the 
bombing, that's September '39, and th
en the ghetto was the next summer.  
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: So, that inŠbetween stage, was your fa
ther able to work?  
Were you able to do 
anything ŠŠ
 
A: No.
 
Q: ŠŠ or life pretty mu ch stopped?
 
A: No.  My father didn't work nothing.  He
 helped out a little bit in
 the bakery with my 
grandmA:  My grandma had a big bakery .  Sh
e used to bake the bread and the cakes, 
everything for about ŠŠ for th
e whole town, the whole ghe
tto used to go to my 
grandmother.  So, my father used to help th
em out.  Then they to
ok him away. I was in 
the street, b ecause I was not used
 to stay with the Jewish kids
.  I played outside.  I had a 
special soccer ball my  father gave me, so I play
ed with the Polish kids in the street, and I 
was very popular with the Polis
h kids because I played a lot 
of soccer.  We went to the 
school backyard  play ing becaus
e there was no school.  At that time, there was noschools, 
nothing.  So , everybody was free.  You did wh at
ever you could.  Then they established a 
ghetto.  When they established 
the ghetto, they took
 away my father.  I don't know where 
they took him, but they took him aw
ay.  I don't know wh ere he got to.  
 

Q: Do you reme mb er the day your fath
er was taken away?  Was it SS who to ok 
him?  Did you witn ess it?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Or just, one day, your father was ŠŠ
 
A: No.  I was in the street 
that time.  I remember when 
they took out the men, the 
men.  They took out the men, and they ma
ke three lines.  And the women on one side, 
that they SS  men was standing on top, on
 spokes.  There was a pharmacy there.  I 
remember now that the names fro m the stre
et was ____ ?Schutzki? 22, was a pharmacy, 
one pharmacy in all of Shedlitz. 
 And the guy was saying, all 
the men go to the left, the 
women be kept in th e middle and with the 
young girls, a nd down
 the ŠŠ the teenagers 
were kept to the right.  And that's how we
 were sorted. And then
 I saw they took away 
my father.  I heard from one of
 the SS soldiers where they take him to Sokolow, on a 
soccer ŠŠ on a soccer stadium.  Where you th
ink they kept the people?  In the soccer 
stadium.  And th at's how they
 stood there for a week, two. 
 And after this, I don't know 
where they shipped ŠŠ 
where they took him.
 
Q: So ŠŠ
 
A: At that time, I didn't know where he is.
 
Q: So, after your father left ŠŠ
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: ŠŠ you were left alone in 
the ghetto with 
your mother ŠŠ
 
A: And my brother.
 
Q: And were the other relatives, we
re you uncles also taken away?  
 
A: No.  My uncle was sick because he was in 
the farming, he was injured.  So, his wife 
died and the two girls died because, you kn
ow, they had no ŠŠ they had no medications 
from infection.  They all di
ed.  And they ŠŠ all the kids in the ghetto, it was 
terrible.  They had no medicati
ons for them, so they were dyi
ng like flies. 
 And in the 
ghetto was bad, bad.  And 
then they took me ŠŠ I wa
s assigned from the Utenrod 
(ph) to go, as a teenager, th
ey needed me for the German  soldiers, for the cavalmitz 
(ph),  as they called it, for 
the barracks, to clean and to 
bring down the mattresses, the 
blankets, and to  take down .  So , they used to
 keep us for a whole da
y, and then at night 
we used to go home, and in  the 
mo rning we had to co me again.
 
Q: And were you escorted by policemen to your
 place of work , or were you ju st able to 
ŠŠ 
 
A: No, they took us.  When
 we stood outside ŠŠ they to
ld us how many kids to pull 
out, you know, the Utenrod (ph). 
 So, they came with a truck, 
and they took us to the  

cavalmitz (ph), to the barrack
s, when we work ed.  From 
the barracks, coming back, we 
did not go by truck.  Th
ey told us to walk.
 
Q: And when you were walking, were 
you able to contact the Poles in the 
community?  Or ŠŠ 
 
A: No.  We walked freely.  They came.  We
 walked into the ŠŠ so
metimes they used to 
beat you up if they know that you're Jewish
, you know, they used  
to beat you up in  the 
streets.  To a park, you couldn't go.  Yo
u couldn't go to swim.  You couldn't  do 
anything.  The only thing you were ŠŠ like a pr
isoner.  But I, most of the time, used to 
run out from the ____ because I us
ed to play with the kids in
 the street.  I was a street 
kid.  So, I used to play.  An
d they know me. In that time,
 you know, the teenagers were 
not antiŠsemitic.  When it came after age 15
, 16, you know, the old teenagers, they 
hated you.  They killed you.  
They took you to th
e Germans to sell you for two pound of 
salt, two pounds of sugar.  But the teenagers 
at 12, 13 years old, they didn't  know so 
much about antiŠsemitics.  Th
ey were educated in the c
hurches, they used to teach.
 
Q: And did you have to we
ar any identifying badge?  
 
A: I used to wear, but I used to take
 it off when I went out on the street.
 
Q: Was it an arm band or a star?  
 
A: Arm band.
 
Q: And you just took it off?  
 
A: I took it off.  I used to take it off and keep
 it in my pocket because I know that the kids 
not going to  say anything becaus
e they needed my soccer ba
ll to play ball with.  And 
that's how we were in the ghetto.  It was 
terrible living in the ghetto, because it was no 
food, nothing.  People used to
 get sick.  And th e tanks used 
to run day and night.  And th e 
SS used to come in and chec
k the apartment once in a while
 to see if there's any men 
hiding out.  So, they  used to look under the 
bed and this, but wh en  they saw kids with 
women only, they still didn't  believe it. 
 They used to ask you, Where's your 
husband? Where's your father?  So, we told 
them, they took them 
out already a couple 
months ago.  But they s
till used to come and check.
 
Q: Now, let's go back to you working in the 
SS  kaserne.  Can you describe sort of the 
typical day?  And I understand 
that at some  point you stoppe
d wo rking there, so can you 
describe that a bit?
 
A: Yeah.  When I came 
to work there, I work
ed there for a while, because right, because 
we used to run up and 
down the steps because there was no elevators, so we had to carry 
the mattresses out, the blankets.  And then we 
used to ch ange the linens.  And down stairs 
was the laundry.  So , when  they  cleaned that
 out, we had to bring up the fresh stuff 
upstairs. And th en when we'r e finished with 
this, they used to cl
ean the streets, the 
toilets.  We used to sweep, yo
u know, the gutters.  And that's how we work ed
 there for a 
long time.  I would say I work
ed there for close to a year. And one day, I was playing 

around with the kids, and I was laughing, 
so the SS men thought I'm laughing from him, 
so he run over to me with 
a rifle with a corbet (ph) th
ey called it ____ th e end side, and 
hit me in my head.  He hit me in the head
, and I fell down on the floor.  I thought I was 
going to  die. After this, I stood up.  I went ho
me.  And I said to my mo ther I'm not going 
after this.  They could kill me
.  A fter this, I d idn't go back
 to work because I worked 
more than I ŠŠ it was already '4 2.
 
Q: And you mo ther and your brot
her, were they working also?
 
A: No.  My brother was helping in the ghetto
, work ing there, you know.  And my  mo ther, 
what can she do?  Sh e couldn't do anything.  
She couldn't do anything.  So , she wasn't Š
Š a housewife.  There was no fo
od.  The only food I got when 
I used to go ŠŠ sorry.  I 
used to go to  my  gran dma, to the bakery.  I us
ed to take some bread, you know.  So, that's  
how I used to meet them, when
 I used to go pick 
up the food.  I used
 to pick  up ____ 
because he was delivering ____
, you know, the wood, the e
ggs, you know, the milk, he 
used to bring it.
 
Q: Was your mo ther's  bakery in side ŠŠ
 
A: Not my mother's.
 
Q: I mean, your gran dmother's, 
inside the ghetto boundaries?
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  She was the only baker.  Sh
e worked to the last 
minute, she had that 
bakery .  And the last minute they  took her, 
Yom Kippur day, and 
the trucks, and they 
finished them off then.
 
Q: Describe ŠŠ so, the Pole who came an d brought supplies to your grandmother ŠŠ
 
A: Yes.
 
Q:   ŠŠ he could come freely into the ghett
o.  Were there other Po les who were coming 
into the ghetto?
 
A: No, not really.  Only he 
came in because he used to br
ing wood or ŠŠ and this.  And 
he used to  ŠŠ he had a wagon, 
you know, with a horse.  A
nd he used to bring in the 
wood.  And he used to bring 
in all that stuff.  They way 
then, they used
 to give him 
flour.  They used to pay him.  She used to 
clean the bakeries down. 
 And then, that's how 
I used to meet him and talk to him.Down to
 the last min u te, when ŠŠ before I made a 
decision to go, I spoke to him,
 and I told him this and this
 time, you know, in the ghetto, I 
couldn't tak e it no more.  So, I told my moth
er, when I came in 
from the street, and I 
heard Yo m Kippur day, going to be the liquida
tion of the ghetto.  So, I came in and I told  
my mother.  So, my uncle says, D on't listen to
 him.  You have a bed for to sleep.  They 're 
going to  kill you.  How do you want to sleep
 in the street?  It's
 cold.  You have no 
food.  You have no money.  No th
ing.   ____ kid.  This is th
e time to  leave, because they 
want to kill us, because ŠŠ don't you see wh
at's going on?  All th
e young SS and the 
storm troopers went to the battlefield.  They to ok them out.  So, at 
that time, w asn 't so 
bad in th e street, because you had just the 
occupation force.  And the occupation force 

was old guys, like 40 years, 45, that were 
not so bad, you know what I mean?  They  
symp athize.  Some of the symp athize, you know
.  They  knew wh at's going to happen. So , 
that's how I find out.  I'm going to ŠŠ I to ld my  mo ther the whole story, you go or 

not.  If not, I'm going to him.  I spoke with 
him.  I said ŠŠ and he says it's  all right, I 
could go.
 
Q: Talk a little bit in terms of how much wa s known in the ghetto. 
 Did anybody in the 
ghetto know of Treb linka?  Was that 
word  ever heard in the ghetto?  
 
A: No, no.  They  didn't know
 Treblinka, and they didn't
 know Majdan ek.  They  only 
thing they used to tell them
 in ŠŠ the Utenrod (ph) said
, Tomorrow, when
 a thousand 
people would go to the station, the trains
 are g o ing to wait for you.  Where you're 
going?  To a better place, to 
work, you have better facilities
 to live, and you'll have a 
better life.  That's  how they us
ed  to go. And th e minute you came on the station, you were 
finished.  They put y
ou in the wagons.  They closed up
, and they  took you Plansber (ph), 
where you get transport that wa
s going to  Treblinka, Majdanek.  
 
Q: So ŠŠ
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Pause one second while you 'r e ŠŠ
 
A: You want me to pause?
 
Q: Just one second.
 
A: Nobody knew about TreblinkA:  They  said
 it was a si c kness.  They take you to a 
better ____ field.
 
[Pause.]
 
Nice Wladek.  Wladek was in love
 with her.  He was telling her 
that this is the time.  You 
have to ru n away from the ghe
tto, because in two weeks, it
's going to be Yom Kippur 
day.  He said, I know, a hundred percent, it
's going to  be the liquidation from the ghetto. 
 
Q: You said your uncle didn't want to
 go, but did your mo ther believe you?
 
A: She had no choice.  My mo th
er didn't  want to go eithe
r, because my uncle, you know, 
he talks her out of it.  So, my mother says, I 
have to go with him, otherwise he's  going by 
himself.
 
Q: And what about your
 brother?  Was he ŠŠ
 
A: He was a kid, a little kid.  He was only,
 you know, a couple years old.  He was ŠŠ 
he was seven years old.
 
Q: So, describe how were you ab le to escape 
from the ghetto.  When did you leave?  Was 
it at night?  Was it during th e day?  Did anyone see you?
 

A: No.  Nobody saw us, because we ŠŠ my
 mo ther ŠŠ and you'll see the picture Š
Š my  brother, we all ŠŠ we didn't look like 
the typical Jews, because typical Jews, 
they could recognize you.  Bu
t we looked different because 
we were raised in a Polish 
town at that time, Aleksandrow 
Kujawski.  We lived in, as all 
Polacks did.  So, that's why 
we didn't look like th e typical Jews.  So, we de
cided, told him we were going to meet him 
at this and this place, and 
he was waiting for us there.
 
Q: How did you leave the ghetto?
 
A: The ghetto, went out throu
gh th e back, yes, through th e 
back.  We got really ŠŠ we 
went out through the back, a
nd we sneaked out.  You know, it was a rainy day, a ____ 
rainy day.  So, it was just good for us.  It wa
s, I would say, around 5, 6 o'clock at night.
 
Q: And tell me a little bit more about
 the person who wa
s waiting for you.
 
 A: He was waiting for you.  So, my mother
 says, how do you kn
ow ŠŠ my  uncle says 
to her, How do you know he's n o t going to
 kill you?  I said, What are you talking 
about?  He works for my grandma, and he likes
 me.  He told me to
 come.  I went with 
him plenty of times ____+ took me to 
his house, and I stood with  him there.
 
Q: And ŠŠ
 
A: So, he says, I'll take you.
  But I have to make sure 
that, you know ŠŠ that's  why he 
took you at night, because it wa
s dark.  So, he'll come, it will 
be dark.  I will take you in 
there.  But, remember, he says, you cannot 
stay in the house fo r the time because I'm 
afraid, because nobody 
should find out.  
But it was a good lo cation, so it was ŠŠ it was 
across the street from a church.  His house wa
s the last h ouse at the end of the small 
town, you know, of the village, 
the end of the road.  And one side to the other side was 
the church .  So, not too many Nazis, not too ma
ny soldiers used to come to check them.  
 
Q: How far away from Shedlitz was it?
 
A: I couldn't tell you.  We we
nt ab out two and a half hours.
 
Q: And what was the name of the man and his wife?
 
A: His name was Wladek, and his wife's name was StasA:
 
Q: And about how old were they?
 
A: Oh, they were old.  Oh, how do you kno
w, in Poland, how old they  are because a 
person 65 was how many died
.  There was no medication,
 nothing.  He was very 
old.  Sh e's special ŠŠ they were very old 
but very nice.  Very 
nice.  Because, you 
know ŠŠ but they were so scar
ed .  God forbid, if somebody 
finds out that I hide Jews, 
they going to say you are a Jew l
over, they 'r e going to burn my  house.
 
Q: And describe your
 sleeping quarters.  
 
A: The sleeping quarters was not bad.  Bu t it was terrible because 
he had to hide us 
certain places in case, you kn
ow, you see somebody walking 
or something, we had to 

sneak out for the ŠŠ you kno
w, the ŠŠ on a small to wn, how the rooms are?  We 
slept over on a floor, on the 
floor, but we had ŠŠ you know, 
like, put down like straw, 
in plenty  time, if he found out that somebo
dy was going to come to 
check the small town, 
the soldiers were going to come
, the Germans, or pass by, so he kept us in the barn, you 
know.  He has chickens and had a few goats, 
you know, from milk he used to  got.  And 
there were chickens.  He had ab out 50 chicke
ns maybe.  And then he had one cow.  And 
he had two horses. So, we 
kept us there.  Plenty of times we
 had to go in there to stay, but 
in the summertime, I didn't  mind staying ther
e.  You know why? 
 Because it was better 
than in th e house, you know.
 
Q: I understand there were woods out
side.  How much time were y ou ŠŠ
 
A: In the woods.
 
Q: ŠŠ out doors?  
 
A: It was a very good location, the woods
, because his whole backyard was woods and 
swamps, so, in the summertime, w e
 used to go to the woods an
d stay there.  We used to 
enjoy ourselves because it was fre
sh air.  You didn't have to sit in one place, you know, 
because she used to look out th
rough the window to see if 
anybody's coming, God forbid, 
so we used to sneak out and 
stay in the wood.  And then, 
if it was rainy or bad weather, 
we used to come back.  So
, he used to tell us when 
it's safe to come back.
 
Q: What was the signal to know
 whether it was safe or not?  
 
A: Used to put on a few bricks
 there, you know, stone.  If you put down , let's say, like 
three, four bricks, one on top 
of the other, that means it wa
s safe.  And ŠŠ but most of 
the time it was safe.  I'll tell you why, becau
se it was th e last house, and not too many 
soldiers, Germans, came that time, because th
ey were busy with th
e Russian front.  So, 
they, maybe, since I w as there, hiding, for the 
two years, maybe once or twice, I'd say, I 
heard them talking that th
ey came to check th
e town, but they never came there.
 
Q: And did the neighbors ever stop by unex pectedly?
 
A: No, because people ŠŠ I told
 you, in our location ŠŠ firs
t of all, they didn't bother 
with anybody.  They were ol
d people.  They didn't have 
no ch ildren, wh ich was the favor 
for us, because otherwise they were afraid fo
r their children or their grandchildren, and 
they got rid of the dog.  Why?  Because the 
dogs used to bark, you 
know.  So, he got rid 
of the dog, and he kept us there. He always
 begged us, even in th
ey capture ŠŠ they'll 
capture you or they'll fi
nd out about you, don't tell them th
at I saved you.  Don't tell them 
that I kept you here.  Just tell them, by mi
stake, you went in here from the woods.  
 
Q: And did you ever see any other Je
ws hiding in  either the woods or ŠŠ
 
A: No.  No.  No.  Nobody was in
 that village except us.  Because this was a village, you 
know, with a lot of farmers. 
 I mean, it was in our favor b
ecause they were not a village 
which was one house on top of th
e other.  It was scattered around.  Let's say ŠŠ I'll give 
you an ex ample, there's 50 homes or someth
ing.  It was far away, one house from the 

other.  An d his location was in the wo
ods, the last one by the woods, by the 
swamps.  And he was across the street fro
m the church, and nobo
dy ever came to him.
 
Q: And during the time you were in hiding, 
did he bring you any 
news?  Did you have 
any idea wh at was going on?
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, always news.  Because he
 was more interested  
about the news than 
I did, because he wanted to get rid of us as 
soon as possible.  He 
told us that, you know, 
when  ŠŠ how he did, the Russians were comi
ng close to this, that only says, Do me a 
favor, when the Russian
 comes, don't run out, in cas
e the Russians co
me into that 
village.  Wait 'til I'll tell you.  Because he us
ed to go to to wn and sell something, you 
know, little woods.  He used to make 
little bundles of wood and sell it in town.
 
Q: Did he ever tell you what ha
ppened to the Je
ws in Shedlitz?
 
A: Oh, yes.  He told me.
 
Q: What did he tell you?
 
A: He told us that when it wa
s the liquidation in the ghetto, 
he told us exactly.  And he 
told us what they di
d with them.  He said he was su
re ŠŠ what you have the pictures 
there ŠŠ they dig ditches and they throw th
em in and then burn them, the one which 
they couldn't take, the last minute, to Majd
an ek  and  T r eb lin kA :  T h ey  bu rn ed  them. H e  
said he know that some of them escaped.  
Wh ere they are, he doesn't know.  He knows 
that some of them stay ed with
 the Polish girls, they say.  
And then, when he came to the 
last time to tell us that the Ru
ssian are all ready in Shedlitz.  
He told us that he saw a few 
guys there.  But he says, Don't say to any of
 these people where you stood.  Because he 
was afraid, he was so scared because the Po
lacks were terrible.  So, when he came ŠŠ 
when he told us that the Ru
ssians came, we went out there 
at night, also, that nobody 
should see that, you know, stood there.  And 
we went to Shedlitz.  He told us where the 

committee is with the survivors.
  So, we went straight ther
e.  And we were not ŠŠ and 
the door, they were afraid 
to open up.  They  thought, 
who was there?  They thought 
maybe the Polacks come to kill them.  So
, in Shedlitz, we di
dn't stay too long.
 
Q: Let me just step back on to liberation day.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you see any soldiers wh
en you were in your hiding 
place, or you just heard from 
him that he said he heard 
they were liberated and ŠŠ
 
A: Exactly.  Yeah.  He said, 
they didn't  come to this sm
all town, the Ru
ssians.  They 
didn't  want to get killed, b
ecause they were afraid, in 
case the ŠŠ because the Polish 
army , they had underground.  They  were ag
ainst the Russians, you know.  They  didn't 
want to surrender even voluntary.  I reme mb
er the ____ and ____. 
 They were fighting 
for a year there.  So, 
they were afraid.  So, 
the Russians we didn't se
e come to town.  He 
just told us that the 
Russians were in Shedlitz.
 

Q: And how did 
you get back to Shed
litz?  Did you walk?
 
A: We walk ed.  We walked.  It took us about two and a half, three hours.
 
Q: And ŠŠ
 
A: We have nothing with us, so it was easy to walk.
 
Q: Did you see anybody on the road back?
 
A: We saw somebody, but they  didn't rea
lly ŠŠ we didn't really pay attention to 
them.  They didn't really knew 
the situation because they kno
w all the Jews were killed, 
so how did they expect?  They
 didn't expect.  But that 
was when th ey came ŠŠ when  
we came to Shedlitz, the peopl
e in Shedlitz, the guys, th
ey all had weapons, gun, 
grenad es, so they gave us 
already.  They  gave us ŠŠ
 
Q: The Jews were back in Shedlitz?  
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.  There were some Jews alre
ady in Shedlitz.  I would say about fifty or 
that.  They all had weapons.
 
Q: Were these people you 
knew from before the war?
 
A: Not really, but they know me.  They
 knew who I am, because they  know my 
father.  They know my grandmA:  But he to
ld me, my  grandmother ŠŠ Po lack told me 
my  grandmother, up to the last mi nute with  
her son, they were baking, with her two 
daughters.  They were, the last
 minute, sitting in Shedlitz a
nd making money.  And what 
they did with the money, nobody knows.
 
Q: And so how long di
d you stay in Shedlitz?
 
A: Not too long, about ŠŠ I would say, six 
weeks, eight weeks, approximately, not 
sure, not mu ch.  Mo re, mo re, mo re.  Wait.  
We took ŠŠ I tell you, the Ru ssians came in 
in '44, end of '44.  We
 stood 'til 45, 'til the war 
as finished in Shedlitz.
 
Q: And where did you live?
 
A: I told you, in the ŠŠ we
 lived in, like was a _____, a 
cloak, you know, before, so 
they made the ŠŠ living quarters for us.  And 
under the bruhat (ph) came in, they came 
in.  They  brought us money an
d food, you know.  Was good, 
was not bad.  But we were 
afraid for the Polacks.  So, we
 stood th ere 'til May, wh en we
 heard, in May the 5th, was 
the end of war.  And May th
e 19th was the capitulation,
 the Germans signed for ŠŠ 
from Keitel, the ____, and Z
hukov ____ .  And th e Russians were good to us.  The 
Russians gave us food.  They gave us a gu
n, whatever you need
, and they gave us 
blankets.  They were very good.  Th
e Russians were very good to survivors.
 
Q: I want to ask you two other questions when
 you were still in Shedlitz.  One is that I 
understand you went back a
nd visited your old home.  
 
A: Not right away. 
 

Q: Talk about when  did you come ba
ck and describe what happened.  
 
A: I went back to the home, let'
s say, beginning of '45.  The 
guys didn't tell me to go right 
away.  An d they told  me not 
to go by my self.  I took two ŠŠ th ere was a lot of Jewish 
Russian soldiers.  I went to a Russian captain, but otherwise th
ey 'll think that you come to 
take revenge on them.  So, he
 went with us, and even  we
 went ŠŠ I knew my  grandma 
had a lot of money hidden someplace, so I went
 to her house also w
ith a soldier.  Nothing 
was there.  But I didn't stay.  
I was afraid to stay there.  
In my house, when  I walked in 
with them, they say to me, We did not take
 any of your furniture.  We don't k n ow 
anything about it.  All from the small town , and they came, they
, like vultures, they 
grabbed anything th at they could, with
, you know, with wagons and horses, you 
know.  When the ghetto was taken out, the de
struction of the ghetto, what do you think 
happened the next few days?  They came lik
e vultures from all over the Polacks.  They 
told me that, was which I ŠŠ he says to me, 
You wouldn't believe, that Wladek  says to 
me, what they did.  They came, like, grab
bing everything wh ich was not nailed down.
 
Q: So, when  you went in 
your old house, were the 
people there using your old 
furniture?  Was ŠŠ
 
A: No, it was nothing th ere.  There was not
hing th ere.  I didn't  see any fu rniture.
 
Q: And ŠŠ
 
A: Because they were smart. 
 They used to give the furn
iture away someplace else, and 
they brought in.
 
Q: And so did you find anyt
hing that was left behind?
 
A: No.  That's all.  I find so me ŠŠ a few ol
d things, you know, like my father's tools, 
was ŠŠ how did I find?  Because in the hallw
ay was a closet, with a hole, like ŠŠ like 
a ŠŠ what do you call it, where 
they used to ŠŠ we used 
to keep in the wintertime 
certain foods shouldn't get spo
iled, potatoes, cabbage, ____.  
It's like a basement but a 
reach down.  So, I knew we had something there.  What, I didn't know.  So, I went down 
there.  I found my  father's tools.
 
Q: And did the Poles say anything when  you said, I'm taking these with me?
 
A: No, they didn't say.  They were happy to
 get rid of me.  The minute they saw me on 
the outer side, I saw they were screaming: 
 I didn't  take anything.  We didn't do 
anything.  Somebody came here and they  took 
ev erything from here.  Because that guy 
was telling me that.  Everything was taken. 
 The minute of the liquidation of the ghetto, 
they came like vultures, running.  You know, 
they were digging fo r go
ld, for everything.  
They  thought the Jews were hiding things 
in the backyard s and in  the walls, you know, 
under the streets, and so they were diggin
g everything to look 
at, they could find 
something.Even they find the 
truth, they wouldn't touch them.  What would they  do?
 

Q: Tell me a little bit about who else was liv
ing in ____ with you.  The other Jews who 
survived, did they al
so survive in hidi
ng?  Had any of th
em come back from 
concen tration camp?
 
A: No.  Most of them was from hiding, whic
h they were hiding out
 by Polish wo men, in 
ŠŠ, you know.  In the woods, a few of them 
survived.  Two young ki
ds survived in the 
woods.  They came out with ŠŠ they we
re ŠŠ you know, you wouldn't beli eve it how 
they looked, with guns, with 
gren ades all around.  So , they  told th em, What are you doing 
here?  They're going to kill you. He says, Us
, they're not going to ki
ll.  We'll kill them 
first.  They were wild kids, too.  And they di
dn't stay too long in 
Shedlitz, those two guys.  
They  left the next day.  I don't know wh ere they went.
 
Q: I understand they were regi
stering people, survivors.  
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Talk about how the registrationwo rked  and who was organizing it.
 
A: There was a committee alre
ady in Shedlitz.  After a w h ile
, they came from all over to 
Shedlitz, because a lot of pe
ople that came from 
hiding places.  They came from the 
concentration camp.  So, there was a committ
ee.  And how they got the money, I don't 
know.  They  gave every person, they gave us
 1500 Zloty at that 
time to survive.  You 
know, we should have su
rvive, in case we don't want to st
ay in Shedlitz.  They advised us 
not to stay, you know.  Most of
 the people, they were advised 
not to stay in Shedlitz.  We 
should go with a Russian army
, where they took, 
you know, was already occupied from 
the German territory, wh
en they gave it to Poland, and Stolczyn, Szczecin, all the Jews 
arrived.  It was coming there, flocks of pe
ople.  You wouldn't  believe it, like, it was 
showing the Ten Co mmandments.  Jews came 
from all the side to Szczecin, Stolczyn, 
hundreds of Jews, thousands of them.
 
Q: And during this period, we'r
e now talking end of 
'44, beginning of '45,
 your father was 
taken in August of '40.  Had you heard a
ny rumo rs about what had happened to  him?
 
A: No.  No.  No.
 
Q: You assumed he had died?
 
A: We didn't know.  Yeah.  We thought he
 was dead.  Everybody thought ev erybody's 
died.  When he came to 
Shedlitz, they told him th
at we went to Stolczyn.
 
Q: And describe what the reunion
 was like with your father.  
 
A: My father ŠŠ my brother recognized him at 
the station.  We used to go to the station 
to see who was going to  arrive, because ever
y time a train came, we went to see who's 
going to  be on that train.  So, my  brother 
recognized when he 
come to the station.
 
Q: And then  he brought him ŠŠ
 

A: Yeah.  We couldn't believe 
it.  But he know that ŠŠ he
 know that we were alive, 
because they told 
him in Shedlitz, in the committee, th
at we are alive and we went to 
Stolczyn, because most of the people, all th
e survivors from all the time, from ____, from 
_____ , from all over, they couldn't stay.  Th
ey were afraid.  So, they all went to 
Szczecin, Stolczyn, and other ŠŠ all the to
wns which they were 
liberated, you know, 
from the Russians, which they 
went to this town was good,
 the ____ was there, with 
committees, with food.  They give you ŠŠ anythingyou want, they give
 you.  We were 
like a new person when we came here.
 
Q: And your father, did he 
tell you right away  what had 
happened to  him these four 
years?
 
A: No.  Later on, he told us that.  He 
was mo stly ŠŠ I don't know how he wind up 
there, but Hungarian and Romani
an Jews at that ____+ came.
 
Q: So ŠŠ
 
A: In fact ŠŠ
 
Q: Break off a little bit from th
e chronology, but what
 happened to your father during the 
four years you were ap art?  After he wa
s rounded up, do you know where he was sent?
 
A: Yeah.  Nordhausen.  Over there, he wa
s a ŠŠ he was working in the factory 'til he 
was liberated.
 
Q: For four years in Nordhausen ?
 
A: I don't know this.  I don't know.  I know he
 was liberated.  A lot of Hungarian Jews Š
Š in 1943, '44, that was the end of the war, 
they brought in a lot 
of Hungarian Jews to 
that camp.  So, that's  how he
 survived, because most of th
e Hungarian Jews, they didn't 
take him in the beginning, because they were 
all home in Hungary  't il 1943.  Then, in '44, 
when they shipped them
 ŠŠ some of them shipped to Ausc
hwitz.  Most of them went to 
Auschwitz, other camps, to the labor camps, you know.
 
Q: And was it very hard reajusting to a life 
with your whole family, after having been 
used to being ŠŠ
 
A: No.
 
Q: ŠŠ on your own?
 
A: After the ŠŠ after the way we lived, like an
imals, all the time in
 Europe, because, in 
Europe, was a very bad life for the Jews.  The 
Jews didn't have anything.  They didn't 
have no education.  They didn't  have noth
ing.  Most of the Jews in Europe were 
shoemaker or, what do you call it, a tailor, th
is, and, you know, and 
th e kids never went 
to school because they didn't have the money to
 send, and they were a
fraid to go to Polish 
schools.  They only went to the Jewish scho
ol, malamitikof (ph), a
nd th ey were teaching 
them, you know.  And they were 
never going into th e streets. That's why mo st of these 
people, I couldn't  figure out how they could su
rvive.  They couldn't
 survivebecause they 

were not used to a strict life.  They were us
ed to living in ghetto a
ll the time.  A ctually, 
before Hitler came into the gh
ettos, you know, that they were ____.  They  never lived 
with Polacks.  They liv
ed with themselves.  
And that life was terrib le The kid didn't  even 
know how to  sign his name.  He wanted to hide
 them, and that's  it.  A nd in the street, he 
didn't  have a bicycle.  He couldn't  swim, be
cause he was not allowed to go to swim.  He 
was not allow to go to a park because they kille
d you.  And then they used to tell the kids, 
don't hit.  If a Polish kid hits you or does so
mething to  you, don't hi
t him back, because if 
you hit him back, they 'll come at night and they 're dead.
 
Q: So, when your father cam
e back, you're all together in Stolczyn.  And ŠŠ
 
A: Yeah.  And then  we went
 ŠŠ I told you, we went right away ŠŠ in a few months, 
we went right away to Ziegenhain.  When 
they made it ŠŠ they ma
de the transport to 
Germans to leave to Germany, because the Po
les gave them an ultimatum, a d ate, that 
you have to leave the houses an
d everything.  That's  all you'
re allowed to take is two 
satchels.  A nd they prepared the trains.  You 
know wh at kind of trains?  Like you had in  
the Holocaust, trains like that. 
 And then th ey came to us, and 
they said to us
, you go with 
them.  You know, the Bruhat (ph) came and th
ey said:  This is your chance.  We want 
you all to go, all the Jews.  
They took from Szczecin, Stolcz
yn, and they said, When the 
train comes, go on th e train.
 
Q: How many people were in your 
group, your Bruhat (ph) group?
 
 A: A lot of, a lot of people, becaus e in Szczecin, Stolczyn, was not only from 

Shedlitz.  They came from all ove
r, so that ŠŠ I would say a 
whole wagon.  I would say 
about 150 people, maybe mo re, and they to ld us
 to sit still, mix in the Germans.  And 
don't say anything, because when you pass 
by the Russian territory, because ŠŠ you 
know, Germany was divided in four sections.  
So, the first section we had to  pass by, the 

Russian territory, then 
the French, then the English, an
d then was American. We didn't go 
to the American, because we were only allowed 
to go to the English 
sector.  But when Š
Š the first sector was the Ru
ssian, when you pass by Russian
, the Russian soldiers saw 
the ____, the train, to 
look whose there, don't say anythi
ng.  If they talk to you, don't 
answer.  Don't make them look that you u
nderstand them. Then, when
 we arrived in the 
English sector, the Bruhat (ph) was waiting for 
us, and they took us off, and they all gave 
us clothing and fo od, and th ey 
put us up in  German houses.  And they kept us there for a 
while.  And then they 
took us ŠŠ they came and said, 
this is the time to leave here, 
because we were already free in
 the English sector.  And they
 took us on the cattle trucks, 
and in th e trucks they  took us to Ziegenha
in .  And at Ziegenhain was where we were.
 
Q: Describe Ziegenhain.  What did it look like?
 
A: Ziegenhain was a regular concentration 
ŠŠ looks like a concentration camp, because 
it was with barbed wire with
 a tower where they watch yo
u.  Wh at do you call them?
 
Q: Watch towers?
 

A: Watch towers. And it was barracks, you 
know, very  poor barrack s, was on cinder 
blocks built.  ReadyŠmade barracks. 
 They put them on cinder blocks.
 
Q: What was your reaction?  Yo u walked in  ŠŠ
 
 [Pause.]  {coughing}
 
So, you had just surviv ed the war and walk
ed into so meplace and it's surrounded by 
barbed wired, with a watch tower.  What was 
the first thing that y
ou th ought of wh en you 
saw that?  
 
A: As soon as we saw all Jewish people, all our
 uncles, we were happy, because they told 
us it was called at time the UNNRA:  You hear
d that organization?  UNNRA:  President 
Roosevelt's wife was in charge, was a comm
issioner.  She ____ + to get it, person and 
thoroughly.  They 're the one wh
ich, you know, didn't allow 
us to come into the United 
States.  After the liberation, I can 't figure 
out why they  didn't let us go straight to 
America, why did th ey have 
to put us into th
e DP camp.  DP camp was actually ŠŠ 
what I was talking ab out, once again?  
 
Q: That's o k ay.  Finish your th
ought, then we 
will go back and ŠŠ
 
A: All right.  I can 't fig u re out why they didn
't let us go straight to America, why they 
have to th row us into DP cam
p.  DP camp s was actually the first person wh ich has no 
country, so they put us
 there.  All right.  They did the 
right thing.  But they put in the 
Nazis ŠŠ you know, I'll tell you the whole st
ory.  A lot of Nazis which arrived in 
 
America, they don't know how they  arrived. 
 The ones wh ich wo rk ing fo r the Germans in 
the camps, the Russians, the vice
 Russians, theywo
rked in the camps, they were killing 
Jews.  And after the lib eration, they were afraid
 to go back to their 
country, so th at's how 
they arrived in Germany and to  the American 
sector.  They arrived 
an d  th ey  op en ed  up  
DP camps for them, too.  They 
put them in DP camps.  Actu
ally, they were not DP camps 
for them, because they're not a displaced pers
on.  A displaced person is a person without 
a country.  They had a country. 
 They were traitors.  They we
re afraid to go back because 
Stalin would kill them all.
 
Q: And talk about your lif
e in that Ziegenhain ŠŠ
 
A: Okay.  When we came to Ziegenhain , it was good. The many ŠŠ I saw a lot of 

Jewish people, our kind, was go
od.  They opened up schools. 
 We opened up a club, the 
kid would sing.  They opened up
 a school for kids.  My brothe
r went to school to teach 
him Hebrew.  You know, they were teaching 
Hebrew because they 
brought in people 
which knew  how to  speak Hebrew , and th ey made ŠŠ maybe six kibbutz in th ere, 
kibbutz draw, kibbutz ____.
 
Q: Did you go outside to
 these kibbutzes?  
 
A: Yeah.  Kibbutz draw.  I wa
s with my  brother.  We stood in the kibbutz.  I was a 
kid.  Wh at was I going to do with my  mo ther
 and father when we
 need to, you know, 

young kids.  So, we went to 
kibbutz ____.  They make Satu
rday  night dances.  We had a 
good life.  And from America came a lot of 
clothing, you know, the clothing which they 
throw into th e boxes, and, you 
know, for th e poor people.  Th
is is the clothing they used  
to bring us.  A whole truck of clothing.  Fo od 
they gave us, as mu ch as you wanted to eat 
you had.  And th ey might teac
h you to  cook the food.  They 
gave milk.  And they gave 
the children chocolate they used  to bring 
an d everything.  It was a beautiful life.
 
Q: And what were your pare
nts doing while you were bu
sy with the other kids?  
 
A: My moth er work ed 
in the kitchen, cooked
 for the people, but sh
e couldn't c o ok, you 
know, and my  father, you know, was walkin
g around with the other people, playing 
dominos.  They were playing cards.  Some of
 them, you know, work ing.  So me them of 
didn't  work.  They took him 
to work, you know, in
 the camp because 
they needed wood 
for the camp.  They need
ed fixing, painting.  They found 
some work for th
em.  T h ey  u s ed  
to be active. But the kids were good.  Ther e was schools.  There was kibbutz.  They  had 
dances.  They ŠŠ the kids had nights, movies they brought in.
 
Q: And were you going to school?
 
A: No.  My brother went to school
.  I was too old to go to school.  
 
Q: And what about the extende
d family?  Did any other ŠŠ
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: ŠŠ family come through?  
 
A: Yes.  Cousins survived, and they came, al
so from Shedlitz, but they
 lived in different 
camps.  They ____ other camps,
 b u t one cousin came to Zi
egenhain.  She lived with a 
little boy.  So, they  lived with us.  But we we
nt, later on, and I woul
d found out about my 
mo th er 's Š Š  my  mo th er kn ew that sh e h as 
relatives in America,
 two brothers.  The 
sister she didn't know because the sister lived
 in Belgiu m.  The 
sister survived  in 
Belgium, and sh e went, in 1940, the last ship
 to AmericA:  That's  how she arrived in 
AmericA:  But we didn't know. So, we 
were writing to Shed
litz ŠŠ I mean, to 
 
AmericA:  My mo ther didn't  know the addre
ss, so we were writing to Brooklyn.  She 
knew she has one brother in Brooklyn and one 
brother in St. Louis, but she didn't know 
which is which, so she didn't know the addre
ss.  So, she put down  Brooklyn St. Louis.  
So, the letter came back and says there's no su
ch a thing in America,
 Brooklyn St. Louis. 
So, now we wrote another letter. 
 And they  found a Yacovich  
(ph), a cousin lived in the 
Bronx, and that cousin from 
the Bronx knew about her two br
others and sister, and he 
went and told them.  So, we re
ceived a letter from him right away .
 
Q: And about what year was it that she wa
s able to establish connection were her 
brothers?
 
A: In 1947.
 
Q: And did they offer to sponsor you?
 

A: They didn't know nothing 
ab out sponsors that time, because that time we were 
registered in Frankfurt to go to  AmericA:  
B ecause we told the Am
erican government we 
had relatives there.  So, that point came out
, the quota was closed for the American ŠŠ 
for the Polish people. Only th
e German quota was open.  They  were tricky, because how 
many German had left on the ____.  So, the 
Polish quota was closed.  So, we were the 
first ones on the list.  We went to Frankfurt,
 and they  told  us, in 1946, you can't go to 
AmericA:  You have to wait 
for quotA:  So, we wrote th
em a letter that we need 
sponsors.  So, they send us le
tters that they were sponso
rs for us.  That's  how we 
went.  So, we waited 'til 1948, 
'til Truman passed the quota fo
r the Jews, vice president, 
that you could go to  America or
 England or wherever you have
 sponsors.  So, that's  how 
we went, in 1949, beginning of the first 
months of the quotA: So , we went to 
Bremerhaven.  And in Bremerhaven, we had 
to sit for two months, because the weather 
was bad.  We had to  wait for army  boat, 'til
 it comes, when the ar
my  boat used to come 
with food and ammunition for the American 
soldiers, their bases.  And the way back, 
they used to ship, yo
u know, the Holo caust survivors.  
So, you know, our 
ship was 1200 
people going back .  It was 200 Ho locaust surv
ivors.  The rest was all the Nazis which had 
survived, working 
for the Germans.

most of them came on false papers.  They 
didn't  come  under right papers.  They get 
false names, and who do you th ink was the 
sponsor for them?  The church
es, from Minnesota, from  Detr
oit.  You know they arrive 
here.  They were the sponsors .  But, actually, they'r e ŠŠ a 
lot of people don't know how 
they arrived here.  But they we
re called collaborators.  They 
were afraid to go back to 
Russia or to Poland because th
ey worked with
 the German.  Because, 
in 1946, when they 
started the war with Russia, 
the Second Battalion, you know
, the Vlosof, General Vlosov, 
he surrendered to the Second 
Army , to the Germans, and he fought against, you know, 
the Russian army. The same 
thing when Stalingrad, when
 there was the battle for 
Stalingrad, you know, they se
nd in from Romania, from Hung
ary, you know, armie s to 
fight, and Italy, you know, they
 fought.  And in 1943, the ba
ttle for Stalingrad, that was 
the biggest battle.  After that battle, you kn
ow, the Germans weren't done.  In 1944, that 
was the finish of them.
