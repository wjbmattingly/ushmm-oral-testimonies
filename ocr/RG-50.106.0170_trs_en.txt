Belgium
, and a brother 
came in

my wi -- my mother, sorry, in 
™3 9, because he was engaged in a divorce with his first 
wife, who he married in 
Poland
 before he came to 
Belgium
. And there were all those 
bureaucratic, you know, legal matters were 
pending. Then, I don™t know exactly wh en 
they pronounced  the divorce, but what I 
know, that he ask in 1937, the Polish 
government to release his mise -- our sister, 
Sarah
, in order for he
r to come to 
Belgium. 
Q: So he had a child in 
Poland
? 
A: In 
Poland
, yes, from his first -- 
Q: Wh-Wh-Where -- where was he born in 
Pola nd ? 
A: 
Blaski
. Must be a famous village because prac
tically everybody that I -- I met here 
say they came from 
Lódz,
 
Blaski
 and all the sur-surroundin
g area. Then, he marry 
first in 
Poland , 
before he came to  
Belgium
, and from ag ain, the last documents 
received from 
Belgium
 show that his first wife al
so  ca me at o n e mo men t  to  
Belgium
, 
and I think he arranged all that. 
Q: What was her name? 
A: Very complicated name that 
I have to find out with -- 

Q: Okay , we™ll talk about that later. 
A: -- with -- yes. And -- but I never had an
y contact with her, I never saw her except a 
glance at one ceremony.

 your mo ther started when ?

A: I-It started -- he came in ™25, I-I was born in ™33, then they must have met before 
that. And there is all kind of story because 
my mother had two sister, and one sister 

married a -- a cousin fro
m my father, coming from
 Poland
, and I have photos where 
he -- he™s seen in -- in this 
Blaski
, the other wearing peasant 
clothes, he had the nice, 
you know, jacket and the hat,
 etcetera. And presumably he was responsib le also to 

bring this cousin to 
Belgium
, too, who married the sister of my -- of my -- of my 
mother. I think it™s a -- a 
little complicated still. 
Q: Tell me about your 
mother™s family.  
A: Well, my fa -- moth
er family came from 
Poland
, and they were all born in -- i-in 
Poland
, and they came in -- in -- in 
Belgium
. We have photos etcetera. I think also, 
™25 - ™27. And I don™t know in ™27. 
Q: Because you said in th
e beginning your fa
mily goes back three generations. 
A: No, I thi -- I think it™s not correct. 

Q: Oh, okay. 
[laughter] 
A: I -- is not correct. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I think it™s two generations maybe. 
Q: It™s just your father. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

A: Yeah. 
Q: Tell me what kind of 
work your father did. 
A: Yes, he was a -- in the ladder, you know
. I know that they 
work , you know, in a 
little room for 12 hours a day, 
etcetera. I think for -- for pr
obably two or three years, 
before he enter in a very successful busine
ss of his own. You kno
w, with -- you know, 
20 work ers or 30, wh ich is -- 

Q: Also a ladder business?  
A: Yes, a ladder -- a -- a -- and a -- a ladder business. But then came a, you know, a 
past, you know, story that when  he came to 
Belgium
, as -- as I mentioned in another 
oral history, he went directly to 
work in the mines,
 coal mines in 
Liege
 for -- for a 
year. And he had always a connection with  
the mining industry, not
 because -- we talk 
about later, that there was 
[indecipherable]
 in the last family who -- who were miners, 
but h-he took me practically everywhere -- ev
ery year back in the mines, you know, to 

-- to see what™s up, I mean, etcetera. And 
[indecipherable]
 were before -- a-after we 
went in the mines, etcetera. That h-he beca
me very, as I mentioned, very successful, 
but again I -- with all those document, I have 
no proof that -- of the fact that he went 
directly to 
Liege
 and work in the mines. This is 
not in the archive of the -- of the
 
Belgium 
government. They ja -- men
tioned that he resided in 
Brussels
, that he had 
this job, that before he went, there were 
exchange of letter with
 the Polish consulate, 
etcetera. And we mentioned that his salary was 
X 
Belgian 
franks
 a year, and that he

was a good work er 
[indecipherable]
 and that they will provide housing, etcetera, 
which was essential fo r somebo
dy to -- to come to -- to 
Belgium
 from 
Poland
.  
Q: Okay , now you were born in 1933. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Let™s talk about your family at 
that time, w as it a religious family? 
A: No, they were not religious. It was not th
at. They follow, let™s say, some practice, 
okay? 
Q: Such as? 
A: Passover, 
Bar Mitzvah
. I -- I was 
Bar Mitzvah
, too. I was very keen to have all 
the gifts, but anyway
, it was a -- in the 
Brussels
 Jewish family, an event, because not 
only the ceremony to ok place at the Grand Synagogue in 
Brussels, 
but it tooks three -- 
three days. You know, the first days with 
-- the banquet was for the immediate family 
and friends. The second was for my  father 
clients, you know, and th e third one was for 
all his workers. So, you know, th  -- it was a big -- a big things. 
Q: But this was after th e war. 
A: No -- 

Q: You™re talking ab out your 
Ba r Mitzvah
? 
A: Yes, bar mi -- it was just after the war.  

Q: Was just after, okay, let™s get back to before the war.

Q: So th ese are your grandp
arents, and your aunts. 
A: Grandparents, correct, and actually th

by my father, you 
know, and -- but I was born in the baseme
nt of a li -- of th
e apartment from my 
grandfather, etcetera. 
Q: Where -- where did you -- you live in 
Brussels
? In the center, or -- 
A: In -- in one of the -- yes, in -- in 
Brussels 
area. 
Q: In the city? 

A: In the city, wa -- 
Q: In a house or an apartment? 

A: In -- in an -- a small apartment 
[indecipherable]
 a small apartment, but I was born 
at my grandmother place, and 
apparently on August the sec
ond, but my father went to 
the city hall on the third, then a-all the pape
rs said I was born on 
the third. How about 

that? A-Again, an administrative 
little problem. And we live in the 
[indecipherable]
 
some kind of basement and -- until we moved 
to a -- a bigger apartment. This must be 
then in -- in ™35.
 [indecipherable]
 was born in thir -- ™35.

ribe your family at that time,

A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- upper class? 

A: My father was certainly middle class, oka
y? He -- he prosper at that time. I have 
only rememb rance that h-he was very succe
ssful. Many things, all the photos that I 
have, we spent at the seaside, you know, in 
Belgium
. I remember at that time, you 
know, there was all those ballroom dancing, 
etcetera and I remember each time I had -
- they -- they -- they -- 
they put in front of the bed all th
e balloons, all the gift, etcetera, 
a-a-and -- and things like that. Later, it was a 
very large room, and my
 sister  was in the 
same room, you know? 

Q: Now, this is the sist
er that was born after you? 
A: No, no, no, that™s 
my half sister -- 
Q: Your half sister.

Q: So did -- did your family 
ha -- did your parents have 
any mo re ch ildren after you? 
A: No, no.  

Q: No. 

A: And she was pregnant when  she was de
ported, yes. That™s -- has been also 
documented by doctors and all that. Then, 
many things about -- very nice upbringing, 
you know, spoiled, like 
[indecipherable]
 by my mother, a-and my father, certainly. 
And -- and the rest of the -- the family, my
 grandfather was a clockmaker, something 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

like that, yes, a-and the other wa -- you kno
w, as I mentioned wo
rk in my fa-father 
busin ess, they never make it at the same le
vel that my father, in term of revenue, 
income, etcetera. And then 
came the -- the war, you know. 
Q: Yeah, well, we™ll g et to that in 
a minute. Were your
 parents Zionists? 
A: Let us say that because he had one of
 -- of his brother in -- in -- in -- in 
Israel
, I 
think he was mo re or less Zionist. He wa
s a memb er o f  th e 
-- the Jewish labor 
bun -- 
bund
 
[indecipherable]
. And this is a very interesti
ng question, because it led to a 
development later on, when  his -- or certainly my  mo ther, were convince that th-there 
will be not, you know, harm, you know, a
nd therefore th-the -- there was some 
distance between Zionists, you know, and th
e belief that th-the
y will be, you know, 
recognized as Belgian citizen
 and so on and s -- and so forth. Then, how -- however, 
my -- our sister was a leader of the 
Hashomeritz -- 
Q: 
Hatzair
? 
A: -- ye -- 
Hatzair
, and you know, she -- she develop 
into a fantastic girl, and they 
were -- they were debate if
 they have to leave for 
Israel
 or not, st -- you know? But I 
think she was one who says we have to go, but it was too late. Too late. 

Q: What language is it you speak at home? 
A: At home I speak French with
 my wife, and she speak Fre -- 
Q: No, no, I meant when
 you were growing up. 
A: Grow -- oh, French.

speaking Yi-Yiddish, I never

bit of Hebrew because of the 
Ba r Mitzvah
 and th e gift, but -- but nothing, nothing 
else, it was French, I wa -- you know. 
Q: Did you live in a -- I know
 you were very young -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah

the time you were very young, but did you 
live in a Jewish neig hborhood, or
 a non-Jewish neighborhood -- 
A: No, non-Jewish neighborho
od. The -- the Jewish, they we
re -- the only strict Jewish 
neighborhood was in 
Antwerp
, you see? Then, in 
Brussels 
it was very -- 
Q: Mixed. 

A: -- integrated, and the other center was in 
Liege,

there was no -- not any form of -- of -- of resi
dences in the street for -- for Jew ish, or

side, she -- and my father, too, never real -- realized 
that there may be some consequence, th
ough th ey should have, with the German 
situation, and with all the 
fal -- th e Jewish immigra --

Poland
, 
Germany

[indecipherable]
 they immigrated in the

Q: Yeah.  

A: -- and I think she was the second in  ma -- first was 
Esther,
 her, and then my -- what 
I want to mention is that in this pre-war 
period, and leading to the -- the invasion from 
the German, I know this because after the war, 
that contrary to some of the friends o -- 
friends of the family -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- it was my mother who resisted, you k
now, leaving. She -- she wanted to keep, 
you know, an eye on -- on her mo ther and 
father. The other didn™t care, they go -- 
went. She refused when my father was 
able to purchase, you know passport from

Central American countries, who were se

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: Well, I never forgave them
, to use the word, and -- and 
she stay and stay, contrary 
to my father advice, etcetera, etcetera. And th
is is why, an illustra
tion of that, that is 
why my  father send me, you know, in hiding
 befo re, because he -- he sensed that 
something, you know, may happen . And unf
ortunately also, my  grandfather became 
involved in a -- in a Jewish
, you know, organization, inco
rporated with the German, 
etcetera, etcetera. 

Q: What was the name of that -- 

A: Jewish -- I can -- I -- it was a -- I™m sorry
 for the name, but I don™t know th e name.

that. The G-Ger -- the German recognize. 
Then , this period, pre -- pre-invasion also

for high school 
[indecipherable]
 for high school. And I reme mb er the school and 
people were, and the professor were, you kn
ow, concerned about the -- the Star of 
David
 at this certain time. 
Q: Were any of the teachers Jewish? 
A: This I don™t know, but I don™t think so.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But, you know, when it was rec reation time,
 etcet era, they were always discussing, 
you know, the situation that th
ey were facing with the Jewi
sh kid. There were not too 
many, but there were some. And -- 

Q: Okay, these were the teachers that 
[indecipherable]
 
A: The teachers, yes. And I remember also
, the teacher were discussing -- because I 
came -- I went back to
 the same school in September 40 -- 40 -- at the liberation, ™44, 
a-and they were still discussing that some
 Jewish kids came back, you see, from -- 
from the school. And it was not possible to 
distinguish th e ones who care, or didn™t 
care, or they had the political agenda, or 
not. Then th-the -- all those successiv e 
decrees from the Germans says that, in mi
d ™41, you cannot atte
nd school any mo re, 
etcetera.  
Q: Okay. Did you, as a child, sense th
e tension? Or were you not aware? 
A: I wa -- totally was innocent, you 
know, at that ti -- I w as not aware. 
Q: Again, you were only 
seven, seven and a half. 
You were very young.

A: I-I was -- I was not a-a-aware of -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- of thing. I came aware when  first, 
you know, we got to evacuate, a voluntary 
evacuation to -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- to 
France
. And th en with tensions, you know -- 
Q: And di -- did -- did you talk th
ings over with your parents?  
A: No. 

Q: Did th ey say anything to  you, to -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- your sis -- no. 
A: They didn™t -- they di
dn™t -- they didn™t -- 
Q: They didn™t. They shield
ed you, they protected you. 
A: Yeah, protected me -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- a-a-and -- 

Q: Well, you were a little boy. 
A: Yeah, little boy. I remember we were firs
t hiding in  -- not hiding, put in a farm, you 
know, outside 
To urna i
 in 
Belgium
, where I remember my si
ster showing a paper, not

to me, but to the -- the -- the family, the 
farmers there. I reme
mber this was a few 
weeks before she was 
deported, yeah, see? 
Q: H-Ho w did -- did your mo th er tell you that
 you had wo rn -- that
 you had to wear a 
yellow star? 
A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: And what was your reaction? 

A: Again, we were innocen t, she said you have
 to wear it, and this was all part of her -- 
of her belief that she will not face anythi
ng that, you know, the German will not do 
anything, you know, and th ings like that, you 
know. And this lead 
to what I mentioned 
before, that she refu
sed my father a -- 
Q: Did it -- did -- 

A: -- a-advice to -- to -- to leave for this 
America
, or to
 France
, or like all man y  
others who to -- buy those Ce
ntral American passport, because he had the mo ney to do 
so, and we would have
 escape, all of us. 
Q: Did it make you feel different, to
 wear this, from your other friends? 
A: Yeah, I -- I think a little, yes, yeah, yes. 
But th-the significance was not there. And 
why it will have been more of a significance
 if I -- I had been member some Jewish 
group 
[indecipherable]
 etcetera, like my 
sist er was with 
Hashomer Hatzair
, but I 
was not, I was not. No, no. 

Q: Yeah. So then you went
 to school til mid ™41?

A: Yes. 
Q: And then they told 
you -- Jewish children could not go to school. 

A: Can not go to  school. 
Q: And how did you 
feel about that? 
A: Not remember, no remember. 
Q: Okay . Okay. 

A: Maybe happy that I didn™t have to go to  school. 
Q: So what did you do during the day?  
A: Oh, th -th-the usual, you know, playing 
with some friends. I 
remember going -- ma -
- my mother put me with the scouts, the 
Belgium
 scouts, etcetera, that I like very 
much, and -- and -- 

Q: And they  didn™t discriminate agai
nst you being Jewish in the scouts? 

A: No, at that time, no. 

Q: No. Okay . 
A: No, no, because again th
e -- the really hard decree came in -- in ™42. 
Q: In ™42. 
A: In ™42. 
Q: Okay, so -- 
A: In ™42.  

Q: -- once schools were closed you just played  around.

[indecipherable]
 
Q: Were you an athletic child? 
A: No, no, no, no, no. No. 
I rememb er we got all kinds of scouts there -- you know, 
events there, and some of th
em I didn™t like very much. 
Q: Did you like to 
read? Did you like -- 
A: Yes, I -- I read, yes, but again, totally
 absent from th-th-the contemporary situation 
which prevail at that time -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- at that time. And -- 

Q: Do you reme mb er your pare
nts sitting around the radio,
 listening to your -- do you 
remember scenes like that? 

A: Yes, yes, yeah. 

Q: But not convey
ing their worst -- 
A: No, no, no, no.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: No. 

Q: Okay, and so  then things started to tighten? 
A: Started to -- to -- to tighten ve
ry much so in -- in early ™42. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You see. Then came the --

Q: You™re still in your apartment? 
A: We™re still in the apartmen
t, an d then came th-the d
ecree that young adults who 
wants to work in 
Germany
, you know, will go, I think ther
e is copy of those kind of 
forms, saying you have to ta
ke only one suitcase and thi
ngs like that, you will -- your 
fa -- your family will not be t
ouched. That™s was her, as a id
ealist, etcetera, say I have 
to do that. So -- and I have a photo of it, 
I don™t know where it is, b u t somewhere, of 
her standing in front of the station in a fur coat and boots. 
Q: This is your sa -- 
A: Sas -- si ster.  

Q: Your sister. 
A: You know. We -- and then I don™t kn
ow, though is -- it is mentioned in the 
documentation that she left in August 40 -- 
™42, I don™t know wh-wh-where exactly the 
train stopped. Is it in 
Brussel
? It seemed that they 
did -- she didn™t go to 
Malines,
 
where th -- all the other Jewish people, like 
my mother, went when the -- really the -- 
the -- the arrest -- 
Q: So was --

was going to work in 
Germany

A: Yes. And that the family will not
 be touched. That™s was in the -- 
Q: Form. 
A: -- in the form from 
the -- the government. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: A-And but what I don™t know 
if they left immediately for 
Auschwitz
 without going 
to 
Malines.
 And this way this -- possibility to get 
some of the document, we will see if 
she really went to 
Malines
, or she went directly to -- to 
Auschwitz
. In asking at the 
center in 
Auschwitz
, they have no trace of her -- a 
Brombart
, and I don™t know what -
- what is the significance. 

Q: How old was she at the time? 

A: Then she was si --  16, 
or 17. Born 20 fi-fi -- 25
th
. And I don™t know if -- they don™t 
have a-any trace of them, then we don™t know. 
Q: Mm-hm.

Holo cs 
mu seum has, from a study of 
Belgium
 Jewish deported to

a. Then -- this is very obscure, and I never 
dealt with the 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Do you know the 
convoy number, or -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, everything, you

German, or it became an oppo
sition to the -- the German, or the arrest. One thing I 
know, he was there. He -- he tried to -- to
 collect funds, like wh at I described before. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: When I mentioned that my father, you 
know, had some money in the factory. He 
said afterwards this was to protect your 
mo ther, who was pregnant at the time, and 
actually, she left in one of the -- the latest
 co nvoy, it was convoy

No rma ndy

happen in  
Norm andy

problem. 
[indeciphera ble]

attic, and he was circling in 
this attic all the time, I still remember 
trace of his path, you know? And he was 
counting some coins, you know, 
to do something. And -- sorry -- and -- a-and I think 
he went outside once or twice, because ther
e was no, at that time, bathroom in the 
house, so of course you have to go outsid
e. And -- and then came
, obviously,after the 
Norm andy
 invasion and -- and we saw hundreds
 of American plane -- or planes 
coming in, you know, and we couldn™t underst
and wh at they were dropping, all those

to return to 
Germany

or didn™t want to do it, he was not an 
SS
, I 
have no id ea. And th ey departed. Okay ? Then

the German tanks, three or four, passing in
 the -- you know, we can see the -- in the

the -- the ally bomb some of 
the roads. And as you know,

 my head, but -- that 
I could not really express, you know, in deta
ils, and I had a reaction to that. You know, 
I didn™t want anything to do with them, or

A: Y-Yeah. Well, it was a huge place, that 
[indeciphera ble]

everything, and I rememb er in the base
ment where my  father found some guns,

63
etcetera. And like stupidly, he -- he -- he gave them back to the poli -- 
Belgium
 police, 
a-and things like that. 
Yeah. And I went to school, and 
then it has been a very difficult 
period for me to catch  up, b
ecause I didn™t go to school. 
Q: You™re now 11 years old. 
A: 11 years old, didn™t go to  school.

A: No. 
Q: You didn™t? 
A: No. 

Q: After all that you had lived, yo

A: No, no, because immediately 
it was back to the -- th-the

affluent life, you know, with my father, who pu -- 

Q: But you didn™t have a typical
 childhood, obviously , and so  -- 

A: Oh, u-under -- I forgot, you know -- 
Q: -- did you feel older than some of the other children -- 
A: No.

A: No, of course not. It was in the same pub

th-there may be some Jewish

[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, no, no, a -- a -- yes, I 
-- I -- not in that school, okay? 
Q: Okay . 
A: All right? That -- it was difficult time. I 
had to -- to -- to learn the grammar, to 
write, it was a disaster. My father pay for so
me extra courses at home, and things like 
that. 

Q: This is all in French, of course. 
A: Oh -- oh yes, that was all in French. And -- and piece of 
[indecipherable]
 I realize 
what happened w
ith my mother 
[indeciphera ble]
 but not the intensity of it, or th-the 
murder, or the assassination, the arrest. And 
I began to -- to -- to get back to the same 
ki -- guys I was friendly when -- before th
e war, who -- who had been put in cemetery, 
cemetery with nuns.  

Q: Oh. 

A: And he was a -- th-they wanted

A: And yes, and then  we ta
lk about the -- the -- the -- 
Q: What you went through? 

A: -- went through, and wh at he went thro
ugh and -- and th is was the beginning of a -- 
of a new chapter where I begin to -- to be  interested in politics an-and labor unions, 

you know? Because a-again a reaction to -- 
to what happened before, okay? And we 
became active in some organi
zations, okay? And -- and this
 was the period from ™44 til 
™49. Was still, you know, discussion and 
th en I became active in the political 
movement, you know. 

Q: Okay, but for -- we-we™ll get to that. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Tell me about the end of the 
war, what was that like for you? 
A: Oh, it wa -- 
Q: -- and liberation -- 

A: Yes, it was a 
[indecipherable]
 and everybody was happy. People who were like 
my -- my aunt came back to 
Brussels
, you know. We were to 
[indecipherable]
 and 
the people who were in a camp in 
Switzerland
 came back, and th ey  went -- the ones 
who were in the ca -- escaped to 
Swit zerla n d
. They were -- they were in 
Kerbene, 
France
 for all the 
[indecipherable] 
came back. We had a lot of memories, and I 
reme mb er the discussion th en was the situation in  
Israel
, and you know, the -- the -- 

the independence 
[indecipherable]
 
Israel
 an d this I remember all that. Some were 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

66
memb er o f  th e 
[indecipherable]
 who wanted the greater 
Israel, 
an d the 
[indecipherable]
 and so on and so forth. I remember th at we were, of course, 
concerned 
[indeciphera ble]
 the Egyptians were 15 miles from 
Tel Aviv
. Of course, 
there it doesn™t count, everything is so cl
ose. We -- and this I remember, and a son 
from one of my father brothers in 
Poland
 also immigrated in 
Belgiu m
, okay ? And he 
became a famous 
radiolog
, one of the top, you know, doctors in radiology, okay? 
Write a thousand of book. If you look on th e 
web, you will see his books all over, all 
over the place. But then came 
the story that because he was a doctor, he -- he went -- 
he was asked to join  the 
UN 
observer in 
Palestine
, you know, during th e beginning of 
the war. And do you know that
 he took me with him, you know, and I knew that my  
uncle was there, etcetera. I didn™t -- stil
l don™t understood, but it was very fun -- 
Q: Are we talking ab out the 1948? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You™re talking about th
e 1948 War of Independence? 
A: Yeah, yeah, War of I
ndependen ce. He was the 
UN
 observer. 
Q: And he took yo
u and you were 15? 
A: 15, o-or what. And it was a trip in the 
plane, in the army pl
ane and then all that. 
And then I began also to -- t-
to -- to -- to learn th -- ab
out what was the politics, you 
know, I -- I began to sense, beca -- 

Q: Right now you™re in high school? 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
67
A: Oh yes, I was in the high school, 
okay? And -- but it was ™48 like you -- you 
mention, and I learned mo re
 about the events with 
Palestine
, the creation of the state, 
about the Egyptian, etcetera, 
and about international politic
s. Becau se m-my uncle was 
in the 
UN 
observer, never observe anything. We were always in the beach in 
Tel Aviv
, 
you know? And wh en th e -- the -- the -- th
e -- the -- some other people in the 
UN
 says, 
you know, you have to 
go and observe the Jewish are doi
ng things like that, they went 
in another direction. You know, 
when the -- when the -- th-the 
[indecipherable]
 you 
have to say what they  did. No th ing.
 And you know, we landed in -- not in 
Tel Aviv
, 
there was no airport, but in 
Ha ifa
, you know, in the little place of that, and it was fun, 
except that I took the 
events seriously, beginning to -- 
to understand and there -- what 
was going on. And -- and met some -- my  
uncle was there, you know, and other 
member of the family, you -- a-a-and 
I forgot to mention who I met in 
Belgiu m
 after 
the liberation. They were in th
e -- in the Jewish brigade.  
Q: I see. 
A: You see? And the Jew -- I remember the 
Jewish brigade when 
th-the -- the allies 
told the officer of the Jewi
sh brigade, you know, it™s e
nough, you are killing enough 
German, you have to be done 
[indecipherable]
 any mo re over there in 
Germany,
 in 
the occupation. Then  th
ey came to rest in
 Belgium
. I remember walking very calmly 
with one of my uncle was the Jewish brigade, etcetera 
[indecipherable]
 which I met 
later, he was in the army, he was in the army paper all the time, and -- and of course 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

they departed. And the -- of course explaining
 that we don™t care about the British, we 
don™t care about anybody. Want to learn -- wa
nt to -- to use the arms, you know, with 
[indecipherable]
 as you know in the history in 
Leba non 
th --
 
and things like that 
[indecipherable]
 that was the bi -- the main group
, a thousand of them. Okay, then I 
met them again, anything. And my  fath
er joined me at that time also -- 
Q: He came over from 
Belgium
? 
A: -- from 
Belgium 
in ™48, and that was my first trip. 
Q: How long were you there for? 
A: I think th ree weeks only, 
because nobody care about this 
UN
 business anyway. The 
same today. 
[laughter]
. Same. It was already clear at th at time. 
Q: When  you said your Uncle
 Lukt -- 
A: Yeah? 

Q: -- was supposed to go and observe -- 

A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: -- instead he went to the beach, did he
 purposely not want to 
observe, or he just 
wanted to go 
to the beach? 
A: No, no, he -- he was one of the -- the ma
ny who realized this was a futile ex ercise, 
that both the Israeli, th e Israeli, we
 were there, didn™t want them -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- to observe anything. 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
69
Q: So he purposely went to the beach? 
A: Yes, like with the other officer -- and -- 
and -- and after awhile -- I don™t know the 
details, but I presume the 
UN
 says, you know, this is enough 
[indecipherable]
 think 
they won this thing, and you know, there is 
no point, because there were things that the 
Jewish did because they had 
to do it at that time with th
e arms and things like that. 
And were not very, you know, acceptable in 
-- in quotation, but 
there was nothing else 
to do, huh? And that™s was it. And -- 
Q: So you came back to 
Brussels? 
A: I came b ack to 
Brussels 
and -- 
Q: Went to -- back to high school. 

A: Went to high school, and explained the kind 
of high school, it was a 
[indecipherable] 
then the -- the socialist party who -- in 
Belgium
 high school, you 
know, where they train people at that time fo
r the different movement in the sort of -- 
the co-ops movement, cooperative movement
. Of course, does not exist any mo re, it™s 
-- that thing -- for the 
health service, because until toda
y the health service is run by 
political party in 
Belgiu m
, and 
[indecipherable]
 then you are to 
go in a socialist 
health plan or Catholic hea
lth plan. And there a story with that too. My wife was a 
very conservative 
[indecipherable]
 and didn™t want -- not
 practi -- religious for 
[indecipherable]
 but still today says something against the -- the socialist movement. 
Anyway, the fa -- my son
 Eric
 was born in  the socialist hospital. And then sh e say, n-

never again, 
[indecipherable]
. Then 
[indecipherable]
 my  daughter
, Sara h,
 she went 
to the red -- Red Cross hospital. Then the th
ird one was the political -- you know, strict 
political party and the other were the -- th
-the humanitarian and things like that.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
David Brombart
. This is tape number two, side
 B. 
You 
were talking about your experiences in
 high school, you had co me back from 
Israel
, 
and then  you went and 
you were talking about the health care system. 
A: Yeah, well, in -- yeah. 
Q: Okay. So you finished
 high school, or -- 
A: No. 
Q: Or wh at was your high school experience? 

A: Well, after the liberation I went 
to the first years of high school. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Okay. And then because I began 
to be influenced
 by politics and 
[indecipherable]
 
I -- I went to the socialist training center sc
hool, okay? With, a-at that time a boarding 
school, but I didn™t go to -- because it was in 
Brussels
, I didn™t go to the boarding 
school, and this was an ins
titution delivering a diploma in 
social work, okay? Again, 
see, in 
Belgium
 you are th -- e-even in 1907, a pu
blic school, and a Catholic school 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

71
system, okay? And th e third one is the state™
s system, okay? And for instance, my wife 
went to the state social training school, ok
ay? And at that time, 
th-th-th-th-the -- the 
social worker™s profession was not -- was not
 recognized as a -- 
as a university, you 
know, school. It™s only later, now, that it 
-- it deliver Master, before it was only 
Bachelor. And because I was so 
involve in this politics that I 
didn™t even finish th-the -
- the -- the -- the course. They say, you don
™t need it, go immediately  into you know, 
the -- the socialist mo vement, okay? And we w
ill take you as the leader of the socialist 
youth. When  we say socialist, I have to ex
plain this again to some of our American 
friend. socialist, in the 
United State 
has a communist meaning. Of course, this was not 
the case, th is is social democrats. Like, 
for the election of the last few days in 
France, 
when they call a so
cialist, he is not more socialist th
an I am, but it -- it -- it is to be 
understood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to
 work for them, but 
before that, when I 
was 19 years old -- 

Q: This is 1952? 
A: Yes. I was drafted in the army, because in 
Belgium
 in th -- it was compulsory, 
okay? Then, you know -- 
Q: Let -- let -- let™s back up -- 
A: -- yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- let™s b ack up -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
72
Q: -- a little bit. 1952. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: T-Talk  -- yo-you did talk about your 
Ba r Mitzvah
 a little bit -- 
A: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- but -- but -- but let™s talk a lit tle bit more about 
it, cause this -- 
A: 
Bar Mitzvah -- 
Q: -- would be 1946. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So -- 

A: 
Bar Mitzvah -- 
Q: -- you said you had three days of celebr
ation, but what were
 your thoughts? Did 
you feel more Jewish after what 
you had been through, because -- 

A: No. No. I -- 

Q: -- you had to be hidden
 because you were a Jew? 
A: -- no, I -- I knew for me it was somethi
ng linked with the heritage. Something that 
you cannot -- like my other -- lik
e this doctor tried to -- he said to divorce himself 
from, you know, the Jewish id
entity, okay? I know that I 
was Jewish because we had 
the -- my friend was Jew -- friend of my fath
er was Jewish. We came to -- to be a -- a 
memb er o f  th e 
Maccabee 
in -- in 
Brussels.  

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
73
Q: But weren™t you angry th at
 because you were Jewish 
you had to go th rough what 
you went through -- 
A: No, no -- 
Q: -- and you lo st your 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, well, you know, I -- 
Q: There was no feelings of anger. 

A: -- there is no -- no feeling of -- no, it wa
s more the feeling of 
the stupidity of the 
entire situation, you kno
w, because of the -- as I tried to
 mention, if I had anything to 
say, we were -- we were -- we would have left 
Belgium
 even before the invasion, you 
know, like many did. And it is an accident o
f, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in 
history that one -- two brothers came to 
Belgium,
 the other went to -- to -- to -- to 
U.S.
, and -- and the other ones were -- went to 
Israel
. Then it™s mo re of that kind of 
things, because in this politi cal action, there was never a
ny sign of anti-Semitism, any 
sign of you are Jewish, or not. This neve
r, never, never happen. 
It may have happened 
here, in the 
United States, 
but not -- and so -- 
Q: But when you -- but fo
r you, in growing up, yo
u had no anti-Semitism -- 
A: No, no, no, no. When I we
nt to the army -- you know, 
when you ask in the army, I 
want to go there, they just
 do the opposite, you see? A-
And -- and -- and -- and I -- I 
ended up in the Air Force near a 
-- we were the few planes that 
Belgium
 had, you 
know? And -- but it was very important in my
, let™s say, development. Hu -- I became 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
74
totally independent, I didn™t wa
nt to hear about my  father saying you have to take th -- 
over the business, or whatever. All this was 
something else. Okay, 
I become an activist 
and -- and -- and developed th
is whole camp aign that no 
Belgium
 conscript, draftees, 
can be sent to 
Korea
 -- it was the time of the Korean war.  
Q: Korean war. 
A: And I say, you know, send the volunteers
, but we have nothing -- you know, we 
were all in favor of facing the Chinese a
nd all that, but we didn™t want drafting to  
come. No, i-it is a bit like here, when th
ey decide no draft a
ny mo re, volunteer. And 
certainly when later on 
[indecipherable]
 the campaign against sending 
Belgium 
to -- 
in the 
Co ng o
, was the same thing. I say, you ca
n send anything you 
want, except the 
draftees, you see. And of course, now th ere is
 no mo re draft, then 
this was a -- a good 
idea to advance at tha -- on that time. 
And the army  was a lot of fun again 
[indecipherable]
 because it was a comedy, you kn
ow. When I finished th-the 
instructions, you know. And of course when
 we were French speaking, they were 
sending you in the Flemish speaking, 
you know, training. I -- nobody could

first thing they ask, where are the Jewish re
staurant? Cause they want the delicatessen,

 girlfriend -- many a -- well, not too 
[indecipherable]
 and I know th at the parents were 
interested, you know, i-in that, and 
-- but it didn™t develo p like that, you know? 
The circle in the socialist moveme nt, oh

Belgium
 policemen and

 You know, they -- the 
German were not to be seen too mu ch, but
 for the Jewish case was this guy named 
[indecipherable]
 and many collaborators, you know

until a certain point, you

losing the war, and then they -- 
they had to -- to co
mpli -- dominate every sector of 
the population and against the 
resistance, which was so and 
so , so and so because after 
the war, practically everybody 
was a resister. And -- and things like that. Th

like many place in 
Europe

cking the -- the -- the 
Belgium
 government to av -- agree that all th
e funds from the restitution be divided 
between the survivors or the son of the surv
ivors, and -- and given 
to the creation of a 
Jewish foundation of things like that. And 
I became interest because I -- I think, 
learning wh at happened here
 with the claims, with 
Eisennstadt
 and with 
Eggenberger
, th-that it™s not acceptable. That 
the priorities should not be there 
hundred and hundred  of thousand of salaries th
at they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the

-- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say 
I don™t need it, but there are some people 
who need  it, okay? And -- and -- and th en this 
is quite important. Then bu -- they also -
- other news about this Belgian archive. Th
en I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was 
Jewish, 
[indecipherable]
 and -- who send me all those 
photo an d reports and things 
like that, which I think is -- is quite importa
nt because there were so many, and answer 
indirectly your question, I 
was not brief on wh en they  came, what was their history. 
You know, anyone is t h at, and 
what™s -- what happened ex
actly with my brother, my 
father-in-law, with my mother™s resistance 
to  all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what is the 
truth was not the truth, you know, in this 
thing. Then it was very important. And this 
led me to -- to ask about this
 interview. You see, this is 
t h e chronology 
of the thing. 
And 
Arnheim
 said yes, it™s very important that
 there is a second step, that all 
documentation is in fact, used, in a way that
 you have nothing extr
aordinary to tell, a-
and I -- I know that. It™s just one experi
ence, okay, and it™s not the same experience 
that the -- th-the -- my father
 was really hidden in the 
house, couldn't go out , okay? 
There were some children also
 in the same si t u ation. A
nd children were denounced by 
people and send into  camp. O-Or my  friends 
sent in a convent or a monastery. Then  
the situation is very, very, ve
ry different. But -- but st --

Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
David Brombart.
 This is tape number three, side 
B.
 Do you 
feel that you lost your childhood since you 
were away from your family for so many 
years? 
A: No. I don™t have this feeling. I think, as
 I tried to explain, the early childhood was 
so gratifying, the memories are all good. A little travel to  
Holland
, I photo -- visited 
the tulip plants, you know, and I -- 

Q: This is pre-war, with your family? 

A: Pre-war, family -- 
Q: With your family. 
A: -- and then it was so -- you see the picture of
 the seaside, that I 
show you. This all 
good memories.  

Q: But you were still q u ite you
ng when you had 
to be hidden. 
A: Yeah, I was quite young, oh bo -- yes, and -- but I remember th at the spirit was 
good. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Good in term of -- of family life, of -- 
as I mentioned, travel 
and gifts, when they 
were going out and th
e arrival of -- of 
Sarah
 fro m 
Poland
 etcetera. You see how 
close, or immediately she develop well, and it was so 
[indecipherable]
. And -- okay,

and th-the war year were some kind of an
 interruption. Because afterwards, I was 
again spoil like hell from my father and trav
eling and -- and very close, Didn™t want 
him to marry or something -- I didn™t say that, etcetera. Traveling all the time. 
Abso lutely no -- no -- no problem. 
Bar Mitzvah
 and -- and -- 
Q: Did you feel very Jewish at your 
Ba r Mitzvah
? 
A: Oh no, no, no. They tried 
to tell me all kinds of -- of
 ne -- knowledge, you see, and 
I did learn the Hebrew , I could recite, becau
se there was some school you had to go to  
in the summer. To the synagogue school -- 
Q: You went to a -- you went a -- a 
Hebrew school, a synagogue school? 
A: Went for the synagogue -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- just for the 
Bar Mitzvah, 
huh? 
Q: Just for the -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, for -- yeah
. E-Everybody who had the 
Bar Mitzvah
 had to go through 
that school. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: For th e Hebrew knowledge. All this was 
good, but I -- I was not
 interested. Then I 
didn™t know wh at was happening, huh? Th
en my father, with his three days of 
ceremony and all that, gifts and gifts, and peop
le who came even stole some things out 
of my  
[indecipherable]
. A-A-And -- and -- no -- and -- no,
 I told you th  -- the only 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
112
time I feel Jewish, when I was asking to ge
t out for a week from 
the army. And that -- 
a-a-and that was quite important, but afterwar
ds really, I was not view like that, okay? 
Even  not in my  work  in the Arab  countr
ies, you know, because of my  appearan ce, I 
could go anywhere I want in the Arab 
country, they take 
me for an Arab.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: When I went -- I remember very well in 
Tunis
 once, i-in front of the hotel there 
was some kind of a incident, I don™t know 
what, but anyway, I was looking what™s -- 
may have happen, you see? Then th e older man 
began to -- to scream
 at me in Arabic, 
and I said, but I don™t speak Arabic. You se
e, all those young people, Tunisians, you 

know, speak some Fren
ch now, you know, sh -- speak 
Arabic, etcetera. I say okay. 
May -- ma-many speeches are everywhere in 
the Arab country, but it was always in 
French of cour -- of course, huh? Now, th
e question would be ve
ry different, because 
of the Islamic influence. You know, who penetr
ates every fiber of -- of society in those 

places, will be difference, very different.
 We would not have 
been welcomed like I 
was 
[indecipherable]
 you know, a defender of the lib
erty and independence and they 
o -- they ask -- we were in 
[indecipherable]
 to -- to -- for so many things, including 
shipment of f-food, under -- you kn
ow, the p -- I think it was called 
PL40
 program of 
the 
United States
 to send food abroad, all this or 
that. Immediately once one of their 
people were arrested, we were going there,
 we freed them, you know, etcetera. No, no, 
no, no -- that™s not possibl
e any mo re. Not possible. 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
113
Q: When you -- you -- you talked abou
t the rise of this militant Islam. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: How do you react to that, considering 
the fact that your life, your childhood was 
changed by the rise of some 
-- you know, a dictator that -- 
A: Yeah. Well -- 

Q: -- deprived people of their civil rights 

A: Yeah, yeah, sure. 
Q: Do you feel mo re of a 
connection, cause he -- you had 
mo re direct effects from 
that? 
A: Ah, yes, and you know, it™s the 
general knowledge of the danger of 
authoritarianism and dictatorship and th
e rise of it and the fact that in 
Europe
, twice 
the 
United States
 had to come to rescue them, that th
ey did it. It™s a -- it™s a -- it™s a -- 
i-it™s a -- a continen t who has been so mu ch 
involved in  internal struggles, going back  
to 
Na po leon 
and etcetera, and the same 
mistake to try to i -- to 
rule in the su -- these 
large territo ries of the 
Soviet Unio ns
. In -- in that sense we 
saw some parallel with the 
Islam, the raise of Islam. 

Q: But my  point is, do you ha
ve more of a visceral reac
tion? Do you know what I 
mean? 

A: Yes. 

Q: More emotional, because 
your life was changed by it? 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
114
A: Yes. 
Q: By that.  

A: Yeah, yes and no, it™s more on the political 
level again, because I was in charge of a 
program called -- the first program called Is
lam against the Islami
st s, to make t h e 
difference between the two, you see, and -- 
and -- and again, there™s nothing religious, 

it is a group of power monste
rs, who will do anything to access to  the control of a 
state, uh-huh, and the -- in the 
Koran, 
everybody knows that 
i-i-it™s -- it™s like the 
Catholicism, a-and -- and the other form, 
built on the -- o-on an 
evolution, which -- 
which show only that with th
e raise of Islam, we see that
 they are as primitive like the 
Catholics were hundreds of years ago, of the 
Jewish, etcetera. Then this is more on that 
kind of level, and the fact that this has to
 be -- has to be stopped because there are new 
factors, okay, meaning -- 
especially in western 
Europe
, with the immigration from our 
country. We have the problem here, we have
 another, the Latin American immigration, 
etcetera, who is different, of course, fro
m th e Jewish immigration, or the Belg
 --
 the 
Belgium.
 I found in the paper so many story where 
Belgium
 descendent, even this -- 
to make a joke, this 
D.C. 
Madame, you know, etcetera, she is born in -- in a place in 
Pennsylvania
 called 
Charleroi
, who is a -- a name of a city, mean you find, more or 
less, and in the 
[indecipherable]
 you find, you know, that™s
 moving, when  they say, 
he was in the Battle of the Bulge, you see,
 or before a -- y -- many, many, many things 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
115
when -- went to that 
[indeciphera ble]
 it™s full, I mean the 
-- in the book. And many 
thing, many way. Ah, you know. 
Q: Do you -- you have a 
d -- a duel citizenship?  
A: I have now a double citizen. B efore it wa
s not possible. I mean, when I came here 
from
 Belgium,
 you renounce your 
Belgium
 nationality. 
Q: You renounced your --  

A: But then again, the notion of citizensh -- 
Q: Was that painful for you to renounce it? 
A: Ma -- no. That was not -- not all. B
ecause I made such a difference between a 
heritage and a situation. And -- and -- and I 
never asked to go in th e Belgian army  to 
defend so-called the king, okay? The king
, for me, was a -- a co
llaborator, the first 
one, durin g the war, of course, huh? Meaning th
at I put this all in -- in perspective. 
And I didn™t come, mind you, American before
, I was here seven ye
ars. You have to 
wait five years, a -- two more years, 
and as w-we talk about the legendary  
Irving 
Brown
, he say, you know, one th
ing done, forget your her
itage, okay? And -- and I -- 
he was more French than 
American anyway, live in 
Europe 
all his life. I recognize 
from one of the best 
[indeciphera ble]
 in 
France
, etcetera, then it doesn ™t mean an -- 
really, when you have this in
ternational outlook. This is wh
en somebody say, oh you -- 
your daughter work in 
Germany
. I say, ah, I know -- w-w -- there™s no meaning. She 
could have work  in 
Italy 
or something else. What is impor
tant with -- with all that, a-

and th-the race of Islamic, you know, i-infiltr
ation in ji -- i-i-in the labor movement, in 
political life and in the society, 
i-is ta -- to remember th at 
Europe
 is still divided 
between many 
[indecipherable] 
and the case of 
Bosnia,
 
Serogovia, 
the fall of 
Yugoslavia
. I say everybody can be tomo rrow a 
mu rderer if you -- if you don™t pay 
atten -- e-everybody can be manipulated in thei
r thinking, in one way or the other, very 
easily. Where people can be convinced, you know, that 
Clinton
 was a great president, 
or you know, it may be, maybe not, but an yw
ay, he™s not one of the greatest in this 
country anyway . A-And -- and the same  can be
 said from -- from the president, who is 
now here. It is a -- a -- a -- a 
state of the development of co
untry, of nation, and of the 
political life. What we can control, and wh
at we cannot control. What a free society 
means. And now came all those great 
[indecipherable]
 thinker even today, in 
[indecipherable]
 etcetera. He said, election is not a proof of demo cracy. But we knew 
this many, many years, that you know, the f
act impose, practically, an election, doesn™t 
mean anything in many countries of the wo rld.
 Either it™s still trib
al and you talk about 
feeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-th eir responsibility is 
vis-à-vis
 their tribe. It™s 
not the 
[indecipherable]
 their country. And there is nothing in th is concep t of co untry, 
of nation. They si
mply do not exist. 
Q: Well, you -- I know you talked about, y
ou know, feeling very in ternational, and -- 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

Q: -- obviously traveling all over the world. 
Do you have any partic
ular feelings about 
Germany
 because of World War II? 
A: Oh, of course.  
Q: Are you comfortable when yo
u™re there, when you visit? 
A: I wa -- no, I visit two or three time, I™m not comfortable. 
Q: Why not? 

A: I think, you know -- I rememb er in 
Berlin
, sitting in -- in -- in a restaurant, you 
know. There were some very old couple. I 
think th -th-they  look at me, you know, and 
they may -- and I™m -- and they must ha
ve been, you know, concen tration camp  
guard s, who else, you know, and th ing li -- 
you don™t know. You don™t know. Going to  
Germany
 two, three -- I went to 
Berlin
 in fir -- first time in 
™56, you know, and -- and 
the question was not the old 
Germany
, it was the east 
Germany
, you know, a-and the 
west 
Germany
, what we do to rebuild them, and th
 -- the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- 
the acceptance of a occupation policy, who was 
not very wi -- wi -- all the aspect of 
which are not -- we cannot be very proud,
 because we use, you know, th-the-the 
police, we use -- etcetera, you -- i-is simp ly
 bring back of what the contemporary 
situation with 
Iraq
, where we did not want to use the army  in the 
[indeciphera ble]
 of 
Saddam
. And the fact that we didn™t do that wa
s a great mistake, because we didn™t do 
it in 
Germany
, but -- or in 
Japan, 
certainly not. Then -- no, I feel co -- uncomfortable 
there. But I must say I feel uncomfortable 
in every -- any country
 where I don™t know

the language, or they don™t understand, you
 know. I -- I -- I never went, because of 
political reason -- well, I went afterward -- to 
Spain 
or 
Portugal
, because they were 
under dictatorship and we find -- 
that™s when I was in the young 
[indecipherable]
 I 
went back -- 
Q: So it™s interesting, it™s because 
of your professional background -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah
, yeah, ye
ah , y eah . 
Q: -- and your political bac
kground, not because of yo
ur childhood experiences. 
A: No, no, no, no. This imme
diately, you know, dissipated,
 because of -- of -- I don™t 
know. 

Q: Have you met other hidden ch ildren? 
A: Oh yeah, sure. Sure, sure. 
Q: And do you feel a 
connection to them? 

A: Oh yeah, sure, sure. Eith
er because I -- I think I refer -- we were member of the 
Maccabee. 
Even  though -- and 
Maccabee 
was a, as y ou know, mo-mostly a sports, 
you know, activity. We had th
e gymnasium, and the ping 
pong, etcetera. But they -- 
there were some lecture, you know, on -- on 
Jewish life, etcetera. There were artistic 
group, etcetera. And we knew that we choose 
Maccabee
, not to be in the Zionist 
group, or not to be in the 
traditional Orthodox Jews, whic
h didn™t exist anyway in 
Brussels
, they were all in 
Antwerp, 
you see. And -- and then we -- we had many 
debates, you see? But the ones who are he
re were the -- the ones who -- who -- who 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
119
decided to -- to move on, y
ou know, with the br
iti -- with the Jewish background and -
- and that™s it. Many people like me went very early to 
Israel
, and we ca -- went back -
- I went back twice or three times. 
Q: Do you feel a sp
ecial connection to -- 
A: Oh yes, sure. Sure. This is another issue.
 This was the Jewish stat e and this was the 
-- let™s say an history was started mu
ch earlier, under the British empire and 
[indecipherable]
 and all that, yes. And of course
 we will -- defended -- there™s no -- 
no -- when I visit the afri -- the 
-- the Arab countries, my boss, 
Irving  Brown 
at that 
time, when we were in 
Tunis
 
[indecipherable]
 the Palestinian came a-and want to 
talk to 
Irving. Irving
 says, go to 
David. 
He didn™t want to talk
 to them. Then we sit 
down  and I said, glad to talk to you
, okay, but if you raise the question of 
Israel
, 
there™s no deal, okay? Can talk
 about anything you want. At that time they didn't even 
want -- they were not talking about a Palestin
ian states or nothing. They  want just to 
be anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an im
perial state. I had many contact, but again, 
through the years he became very dangerous,
 you know, in terms that we were close 
from the -- the exile group, 
even  from inside and outside the Tunisian of the 
[indecipherable]
 
Algeria
. And people were -- my friend were assassinated. It is 
another story, I can tell you wh ere we ha
d, for instance, the liberation movement 
against the French in 
Algeria
. I visited the border 
[indecipherable]
 kind from 
Tunisia, Morocco, 
all that.
 
But the people we are deali
ng with were eliminated by 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
120
their own people after they took independen
ce, you know, their frie
nds had been torn  
out from this -- from stairways 
and things, oh, terrible. S o me were assassinated in 
Paris,
 which I knew and I was very con -- of c
ourse, concern about it. But again, when 
you talk to a -- a guy like 
Irving  Brown, 
he accepted that 
[indecipherable] 
and never 
talk about that. His best friend die 
[indecipherable]
 never talk about that. And we 
were involved in all kind of operation, etce
tera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and 
children, wh en I was awarded, you know, 
commander honor of th is award, national 
award, you know, th -- of this o
fficer, of that, and the other, and 
chevalier -- 
knights
 
of 
that.
 Senegal
 and -- and 
Do umay
, and -- 
Seneg a l, Do umay
, and oh, what™s the third? 
Togo
, huh. And I came back each
 time so proud of the men 
[indecipherable]
 that they 
laugh at me. And the na -- the big, you know, 
diploma, I wanted to 
put this in my little 
[indecipherable]
 no, no. It™s only -- it™s a true story, of course, like everything I told 
you, of co urse. I brought it from the baseme
nt and I put it back, two of them. One is 
too big in th e -- in my  guestroom, and the othe
r one is too big, I -- 
I left in that. And 
then people are asking me, but why did you get?
 I say, look, this is to organize a ch -- 
regime change, the other was to oppose one. And -- and things like that. But that™s 

another aspect, and I think it™s very 
well describe in -- in several books. 
Q: What was your reaction during the 
Eichmann
 trial, do you rememb er? 
A: Oh yes, of course. We were all in favor 
of it, and I think my  wife wants nothing to 
do with all that -- with 
[indecipherable]
 conservative says, why a trial? Kill him 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
121
[indecipherable]
 you know? It™s like what she 
said things about the -- the 
unfortunately situation with the 
killings in school, etcetera 
[indecipherable]
 I say, 
why do you go thr -- they go
 all through that, you kn
ow? Each time somebody -- 
Q: Well, I was wondering, did it make you thin
k of the loss of your mo ther, the loss of 
your sister? 
A: Oh yeah -- 

Q: Did it -- did it bring you right back? 
A: -- th-the -- oh no, the -- yeah. 
Q: That™s what I meant. 

A: Yeah, the whole tragedy o-of that period
, of course. And when there is -- I don™t 
know wh ether before, I was going 
some movie a-about, you know, 
Eichmann
 arrest, 
or about the -- the thing, but 
you know, in the book on the 
Belgium
 deportation th at 
there is upst-upstairs 
[indeciphera ble]
 that I have it at home, you know, with the list 
of the convoy, etcetera, there is, at the end, the trial in 
Kohn,
 
Germany
 of the mi -- 
the one who did all that in 
Belgium
, okay? H-he went free after five years. Then, for 
me it™s another a-aspect, it™s a -- it™s really sh
owing that -- that the society evolves, that 
this thing of remembrance, it™s -- i-i-i-
it™s something personal,
 but when you are 
involve in all those acts, there is 
no justice, you know, only for the few. 
[indecipherable]
 
Nuremberg
 and all that, it™s only a few, what, 20 people, or 50 
people. Of course, what we did with 
denazification
 in  
Germa ny
 was excellent, of 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt  
 
May 7, 2007 
 

 
 
122
course, excellent. And th-there became, like in 
Italy
, etcetera, recognition that people 
have to live with the regime 
that they have, you know, a
nd as I mentioned before, the 
populace, the people are -- are 
subject to so much more 
[indecipherable]
 that today™s 
-- even an election in a s-so-c
alled civilized country  has di
fferent meaning for different 
people. 
Q: What is your feeling coming in
to the Holocaust 
Museum building? 
A: The first time? I went ther
e three times. I went here -- 
Q: No, I™m talking about this -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, I went -- 

Q: -- th-this one in 
Washington. 
A: -- three time. Oh yes. I decided -- 

Q: Do you have any emotional 
reaction when you come to it? 
A: No, I have more -- better illustration of some
 of the -- th-the situation. I went to -- 
in the 
[indecipherable]
 where you can follow the deportation on the screen, you 
know? Then I look at 
Belgium
 and I say, that™s not enough, it™s not even very -- it™s 
quick ly done. I don™t think that they show 
any -- you cannot s -- have any remo r -- or 
any comment, you know. I-I went 
back because they have some
thing of a list, my aunt 
who ca -- before she fa -- came here and then
 before she died -- 
you know, there is -- 
her name is on it, but her husband name is 
not on it, you know. Ce
rtainly mine is not 
on it, because I never put it, nobody ask, you 
see? The best place is th e reflection, you 

 
Interview with David Bromba rt

123
know, pool there, with the wall, that™s impor
tant. But to go th rough 
a place with all the 
photos of -- of people deport -- I™ve se
en that, I-I -- you know, it has no -- you know, 
I™ve -- this I know about 
Belgium
, etcetera. This I know
. And to have a little 
[indecipherable]
 around 
Belgium
 doesn™t mean, you know, anything. Because they 
concen trate on 
Poland
, on the big countries. 
Q: Do you belong to
 any hidden  children organizations? 
A: Yeah, well, to -- no, yes? 
Q: I mean, here in the 
United States
? 
A: Oh, no, no. 

Q: That™s 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: I tried to contact one, I saw somebody te
stify in front -- before the Congress. Some 

guy who -- who supposed to have a group to
 defend the survi -- 
the children of the
