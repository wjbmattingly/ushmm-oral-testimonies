Question: This is the 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Helena Swierczy nska
, in 
Arlington Œ
 I™m sorry, in 
Alexandria
, 
VA
 on Novemb er 
8
th
, 2008. And the interv
iew is conducted by 
Stephanie Blyskal.
 Good evening, 
thank you for letting us interview you. Ca
n you start out telling me your name at 
birth, and where you were born? 
Answer: My name is 
Helena Swierczynska
. I was born on the April 2
nd
, 1943, in 
Poland
, in the place called 
Mielitz
(ph). I™m not positive, I™m not sure hundred 
percent that this is exactly 
where th Œ I was born, but th
at™s what is in my birth 
certificate. My family was in hiding. Year
 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever, 
in 
Poland
. Until today I don™t understand how
 my mom could afford to get 
pregnant, you know, during 
such a horrible time. But a
nyhow, she had the baby in 
hiding. Most of my  family was hiding in th
e Œ the Œ in  the barn. 
The family lived in 
a small village. We had a little bit of land,
 couple houses, nothing big. But enough, 
big enough to be hated by 
all Polish neighbors. So my
 family, which means my 
grandmother, my  grandpa, and 
bunch of cousins, they we
re hiding in the barn  Œ 
paying, of course, huge money for it. 
And my  mo m had me that summer, I don™t 
know wh ere, and with help of midwife. 
Well, the midwife, sh
e was Polish, and she 
didn't  want to have a Jew Œ Jewish baby
, you know, for longer than few hours. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

she kept me actually one day after I was 
born. And then  my  mo m, you know, after 
delivery, she was sick, not able to Œ to 
do nothing. So  my  two uncles, my  mo m™s 
brothers, they came to pick me up. It is ve
ry important to unders
tand that I was one 
day Œ one day old. My Œ my  mo m was the 
only daughter, and she 
had four brothers. 
Two of them, they took me from that midw
ife, to the place that the family was 
hiding. And I was crying and cr
ying and crying. By the way,
 I just learned this all 
few years ago. I had no idea wh at happened  to me. But my  uncle who Œ who was 
about to die, finally he felt that he need
s to tell me something. So that™s how I 
learned, you know. Today I am 65, and 
I was probably about 60 wh en the Œ you 
know, I learned wh at happened to  me. So 
anyhow, I was crying, I was screamin g. 
Probably I was hungry, I was wet. And a
ll those people hiding th ere were scared 
that, you know, they gonna be
 killed because of me. So 
my grandma, according to 
my  uncle, my  grandma decided th at I cannot be with them. She came up with  an 
idea that she™ll Œ they will put me on Œ on 
the ground where peopl
e walk by a lot, 
and somebody will see a crying baby and w
ill take the baby. That™s what she was 
hoping. Well, nothing like this happened . 
They put me on that frozen ground. It Œ 

you know, the beginning of Ap ril in
 Poland Œ
 I don™t even think it was April, cause 
the Œ there is no certain date, you know, th
at™s Œ probably  it was in March, because 
it was very, bitterly cold. So 
they put me, you know, on th
at cold ground, you know, 
and they  were looking through, you know, so
rt of the hole in the wall, looking at me  
what™s gonna happen. And people were 
walking Œ were walk
ing by, and nobody 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

stopped. No body stopped. I was screaming li
ke crazy, they were crying. Finally, 
after I don™t know how many hours, my  gr
andma said no, I Œ I cannot do this. Sh e 
decided, you know, to take 
me back and wh en night came, my  two uncles took me Œ 
still, you know, screaming, to the house of
 the lady, very simple woman, who was 

apparently  mentally sick and nobody talked
 with her. People were scared of her. So 
she was without of contact 
with Œ with anybody. And 
her house was on the Œ on the 
skirt of that village. They to
ok me there, cause they th
ought, she™s alone, maybe she 
will take the baby. So one y
ear old baby Œ I mean
, one day old baby Œ this is very 
important and th at™s why I repeat it, you 
know, they put me on her steps. I was 
screaming. She opened the door, she saw the 
baby, she took me in. So this was ™43. 
I was in her house until ™45. No idea how Œ 
how Œ what happened 
during this time. I 
might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, 

she was scared, too. So, actually Œ okay, of course, there was no milk. I was 
feeding, you know, with potatoes and wate
r. I don™t know how th is happened that I 
survived. It™s Œ I™ve talked 
to the doctors, they say th
ey never heard about such a 
thing. But an yhow, what happened during th
ese two years, my  mo m, of course Œ my  
father was in a forest, hiding there. An
d my  mo m was very depressed. She was 19. 
She lost her baby, wh ich she never touched.
 Sh e didn™t have parents and family. So 
she, one day she decided to 
go where they were hiding to see her mo m and her dad. 

And the people who in the meantime took 
over our houses, our land, these people 
saw d Œ her going th ere. And th ey let know 
to the police Œ Polish police, which was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

working very close with Gestapo, a
nd th-the Germans came, killed almost 
everybody immediately. My tw o uncles, they
 were not there, they were hiding in 
the fields. So my mom, appare
ntly that they Œ they didn
™t kill her at once, but she 
was hurt badly. And a few years ago, I went 
there. I was told no
t to by many people, 
because the people living th
ere, they rememb er the fa
mily. They stole everything 
which belongs to us, and I was told  it™s dange
rous to Œ even to be around, especially 
that I look hundred percent like 
my  dad, so I am very easy to recognize. Bu t I did, I 
go, I did go there. And I saw Œ I met li Œ 
a lad y  who was Œ I was just asking million 
questions, you know, and ju
st betw een one sentence and the other, she told me 
about my family. I co uldn't
 believe my  ears, but I Œ I didn™t even  ask about the 
family. But she started  to say, oh, we™ve 
had the Jews, you know, here. There were 
parents and five kids, you know. There wa
s one Œ one girl and 
four brothers. And 
that girl, she had a baby that™s Œ the la
dy is telling me, you kn
ow, I am standing in  
front of her. And Œ and she says, but that 
baby for sure didn™t surv ive, she says. And 
she says, I will never forget 
the scene the day they killed 
all Œ all that family, you 
know, hiding there. And sh e was not kille
d immediately , but she was hurt badly. 
And she had the long hair. Th
ey  grabbed her, you know, fo
r the hair, and they were 
dragging her through the main 
street of that village to 
the nearest forest. And they 
then Œ sh e was killed there. And that woma
n tells me, you know, I Œ this Œ I Œ I can 
see like today, you know, th
at blood, you know, behind 
this woman. She had no 
idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma,
 you know. I Œ I wasn™t sure Œ I mean, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
7
 
 
that was no time to think it over, but I Œ 
you know, I wanted to do so mething with 
this, so before I left, you kn
ow Œ I was with my  husband, by the way, he is Polish, 
and he was shocked even mo re than I was.
 And my  husband says, let™s go, let™s go, 
don™t Œ don™t stay here. But befo re I le
ft, you know, I ask her, do you know whom 
you™re talking to ? And she says no. I sa id, I am that baby, and I survived.  
Q: Wow. 
A: And you have my houses
, my land and everything. Y
ou will never, ever be with 
Œ in peace with this. That™s how I left. So
, you know. But going 
back, okay, so Œ so 
I left. I mean, I lost everybody. I had on
ly my father and two uncles. My father 
survived the war, he was in 
hiding in the forest. And he
, right Œ you know, when  Œ 
when  war Œ you know, was over, the Russian
s came in, because 
I™m talking about 
eastern Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ 
Poland
. So first, you know, they didn™t
 see Americans, they Œ they saw 
Russians, and th e Russians, you know, came 
in and my father somehow was able to 
get in touch with my  Œ one of my  uncles,
 and he knew wh ere I was, you know, in 
which house you know, I was, you know. He
 knew I survived. So, it was Œ he came 
in the evening. So, he deci
ded to wait until the morning 
to pick me up, you know, 
take me from there. And one of those Po
lish people, you know, who Œ I can say it, 
they killed my family, okay, 
saw him, and they got scared
. So, what they did, they 
killed him, just from outside of the hous
e through the window. He was shot and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

killed immediately. My uncle who was with hi
m, he saw it, he run to the street, and 
the Œ the Ru ssian tanks, you know, were 
coming, you know. He stops one of the 
tanks and he says, oh, th-th-th-the Pol 
Œ Polish guy just killed a Jew, you know? 
And that guy, the Ru ssian guy says, do 
you know who, exactly? My uncle says, 
yeah. My uncle, the one who 
told me this story, which 
I was waiting, you know, 50 
year Œ 60 years to hear. And he said, ye
s, I know. Show me. Well, Russians killed 
the guy, you know. 
Q: Wow. 

A: Just like this. So, okay. So  I had 
two uncles, young me
n. Because you know, 
fo u r  k i d s, my  mo m was th e o l d est. S o  my  mo m was lik e Œ  mo re li k e  a mo th er to  

them, okay? They  Œ they cam
e to pick me up Œ well, act
ually, they Œ he told me 
with this Œ I™m gonna tell you a lot of
 bitter words about Jews. I™m sorry. 
Q: Mm-hm, it™s fine. 
A: But my  uncles, you know, th ey didn™t take
 care of me. He told me that when he 
came, you know, to see me, you know, I wa
s behaving like Œ like a little animal. I 
was hiding everywhere, I Œ I didn™t let anyb
ody to come close to me. I was Œ you 
know, sick. Later, you know, I Œ I Œ you
 know, the doctors discovered I had 
tuberculosis, I am surprised only tubercul
osis, you know. And I didn™t speak. I Œ I 
ha Œ hardly walk. I was Œ I was just like,
 you know, like animal. 
So he was not even 
able to Œ to come close to me and touch me
. So they left me. They left me and this 
woman, she didn™t want me. I don™t thinks 
she ever liked me, but you know, it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
9
 
 
something human in  her that she took 
me in. But anyway, as soon as it was 
possible, she put me in the 
orphanage home. It was ™45 -™
46, a lot of anti-Semitism 
in 
Poland
 til today. So, I started my  second holocaust, which I am very 
disappointed , you know, like 
[indecipherable]
 you know, you talk a lot about, you 
know, what happened , how was the war, th
is and that. No body 
talks about people 
after the Holocaust. People Œ especia
lly about the people who were still in
 Pola nd. 
Q: Right. 
A: And had to face, you know, another 
holocaust, another hatred, another anti-
Semitism. 
Q: Can I just stop you for one minute Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and ask you one question. Wh at di Œ 
you have no memo ries of being in  this 
house with this woman Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ who was taking care of you? 

A: No. 
Q: What Œ and we™re probably 
going to  get to this, but wh
at do you think your first 
memory was? What™s the 
first thing that you reme
mber as a Œ as a child? 
A: The Œ the orphanage home. 

Q: Mm-hm. And where Œ where was that? 
A: Hoo. How many, you should ask. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
10
 
 
Q: How many were there? 
A: Seven. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So where did you start out? 

A: So, I was in orphanage home in 
Kraków
, in 
Zh eshuv
, in 
Kielce
 and 
Radom
. 
Q: Right. So Œ so when  s Œ 

A: They seventh Œ you know, th e thing wa
s, nobody wanted to adopt me. Ah. And 
my uncle, my beautiful fa
mily, they just escaped 
Poland
. 
Poland 
was a dangerous 
place to live, so they just 
escaped, they left me. Like 
piece of nothing, garbage.  
Q: How Œ 

A: Little girl, completely 
unprotected, with nobody. 
Q: Right.  
A: And they Œ first they went to 
Breslau, [indecipherable] 
then from there to 
Germany
. From 
Germany
 to  
America
. And I was still alive, one orphanage home, 
second, th ird, fourth, fifth. Many, many ki
ds were adopted. And I rememb er nobody 
wanted me. I was ugly. I know I am Œ I am good looking now. I am like a, you 

know, wine, which you know, ge Œ as mo re 
is Œ older it is, is 
better, yeah. I am 
somehow Œ yeah, I am kind of attractive wo
man comp aring my  ag e, of course. But, 
as a Œ as a child, I was ugly, and I didn™t sp
eak. I hardly walk. I peed in my pants, 
you know, until I was probably 
11 or 12. Scared to death,
 and physically sick. So, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
11
 
 
was Œ it was very difficult, and this I re
me mber. Seeing, you know, a lot of kids, 
you know, going with the othe
r families, and I was still 
there. And because, you 
know, it was after war, you know, lack of 
money and th is and that. So they  were 
closing one home and open another one, an
d they were transferring, you know, 
kids. 
Q: Right. 
A: So that™s how, you know, 
I was traveling. And one day, I was seven years old, 
look how many years I™ve Œ I Œ I was ther
e, came the man, by himself. He was 
looking for somebody to  adopt. He was 
by himself, without a wife, which was 
stupid, because that kind of decision sh ou
ld be, you know, take
n by both parents. 
But, you know, she pr
obably told him, we
ll, whatever you do, 
you know, I agree. 
So he saw me, he was very good man, a
nd he said, her. So to Œ they  adopted  me. 
Unfortunately, she disliked
 me from the first moment
 she saw me. Actually, you 
know, now, looking you know 
to the back from the pers
pective, all the years of 
experience and, you know, kn
owledge, I got about life, 
about people, I think she 
was mentally sick. And her behavior, you kn
ow, is really difficult to explain. But I 
know it now. As a little kid, you know, I just
 felt, not only not lo
ved, but just Œ you 
know, being hated, you know. Very scary 
thing to  somebody like me, who hardly 
survived.  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
12
 
 
A: Anyhow, he was wonderful guy, but he 
was weak man, and she was the one with 
Œ with th e pants, you know, so they both
 were communists and she was, as I sa y, 
more red than the red flag. So maybe th
at™s why I never enrolled in communist 
party, and everything which goes with
 communists, you know, is, you know Œ 
Q: Righ t, mm-h m.  

A: Œ against what I believe in. Because I di
slike her with all my 
heart. So this was 
my third holocaust. And she hated me that 
much, that finally it came to the point 

that I had a choice, to get married with wh
oever and then  get out, or just to go on 
the street. 
Q: Right. 
A: So, you know, I got married. 

Q: How old were you? 

A: 19. And the guy, he knew I was a Jew.
 I knew nothing about 
my family. What I 
told you now, I learned few years ago. I 
knew nothing, zero. 
I knew I am a Jew. 
Q: Right. 

A: That™s all.  
Q: Did you have Œ still have your birth ce
rtificate with you, did you have paper Œ 
A: I never Œ I ne Œ 
Q: Like, how did they know y
our name, how did they  know Œ 
A: I had zero documents. All I have is one
 picture of my  dad, that my  uncle gave 
me, nothing about my mom. And my birth certificate was written after the war, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
13
 
 
wher Œ and th-there Œ there is, you know
, a note, parents un Œ unknown, you know. 
So actually, I™m not certain of the day, I™m
 not certain on the pl
ace, you know. It™s 
just Œ it just a Œ a document Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ means nothing to me. 

Q: Did your uncles Œ when  Œ 
your uncle wh en he dropped 
you off at the orphanage, 
or however you got there, he gave you your information? 

A: No, no Œ 

Q: No. 
A: Œ no, no. What happened with 
them, th-they f Œ they came to 
America
, and 
before they came to 
America
 they  Œ they  started to make money in 
Poland
 selling 
this and that, you know, it was popular th
en. Popular way to make money. Bu t 
anyhow, no, actually they like cro
ssed me out. And I didn™t know Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ about them. I Œ I didn™t know noth
ing, until one day Œ one
 day. My oldest 
uncle, he was about to be called to 
Korea
 in  ™53. And he was 
afraid that he might 
not come back. So he decided to  look fo
r me. I mean, it was 
something, you know, 
he was, I guess, afraid  to face the God.
 He started to look for me through Red 

Cross, because they Œ first, you know, th
ey  contact the Œ the orphanage ho-home 
they know I was Œ that Œ that address cha
nged and changed. They
 went thro ugh Red 
Cross, and finally he was able to find me
 being adopted to those people. The name 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
14
 
 
was 
Zy ro, z-y-r-o
. But I just got married. So, so
rt of like he wanted to do 
something for me. Actually, it was too late. And Œ 
Q: I Œ I guess I™m wondering how the peop
le at the orphanage knew who you were. 
Like, how they knew your name, how they
 knew wh en  you were supposedly born. 
A: They probably called Œ they  Œ they 
gave me the name, and you know, it was 
following Œ following me from one place to another. 

Q: So, th ey si Œ they probably knew your last name. 
A: No, no, no Œ 

Q: No. 
A: Œ no, no, no. 
Q: No? 

A: Because you know, that uncle I™m talk
ing about, he™s the one who told me Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ this whole story a few years ago, 
before he died. And he didn™t know my  
name, and nothing. You know, I was just born.  
Q: Right. 
A: You know. They w Œ they 
all Œ I mean, th Œ th Œ my
 uncles, they were young 
men. And I am surprised that Œ which I to
ld him, cause I am 
very open person, you 
know, and if I have something to say, I do 
say, no matter what. And I told him once, 

I asked him, how could you leave such a little
 baby after this all, and just escape, 
you know, to Œ how can you, 
you know, leave like this, 
with this knowledge? He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
15
 
 
said oh, you know, we were so young, we 
Œ we win Œ we knew we
 had Œ we have to 
escape. What do we do a do 
Œ what do we Œ we do with  
such a baby, you know, we 
Œ we Œ we wouldn™t even k
now what to do. And I said, 
hey, people you know, go to  
concen trate camp, you know, go t Œ you know
, to air Œ anything and everything, the 
family is together. We Œ 
the Œ people were dying be
cause they wanted to be 
together. So there is no way, never ever, 
that I can understand and forgiv e. And I 
told him this. I told him th
is. So Œ but anyway, so I Œ I knew I have a family in
 
America
, okay? Well, I thought th
ey, maybe they Œ they  can help me, or whatev er. 
Well, the life in 
Poland
 was not easy. One thing I have to say positive about my 
step-mom. As bad as she was to me as a 
mo m, she was very demanding in terms of 
education. She pushed me hard, so I had 
to  go, you know, higher and higher and 
higher. And this is something that, I have
 to admit it, I have because of her. How 
much I need  it, I don™t know. Well, definite
ly it™s useful, but anyhow, with my first 
husband, I Œ I had th e first son who died 
shortly after was born. It was sort of 
pathology you know, probably
, it doesn™t matter. But it still hurt, you know. Then, I 
had another son, and my  son,
 Robert,
 he™s gonna be 40 in few days. He™s 
everything I have. So  one day,
 I, before he graduated from the high school, I send 
him to
 America
 for a vacation, to see the friends
, and Œ and he fe
ll in lovewith 
America
. He got crazy about 
America
, you know, he loved everything here. He 
begged me, Mom, I love this country. Do 
whatever you can, come here and we will 
stay here. Well, you know, I have only one s
on, and as I say, nothing else matters in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
16
 
 
my life. So I said okay, I™ll try, I™ll see.
 Took me three years to get Polish passport, 
because it still Œ we had the communist. 
Q: Right. 
A: Communist there, and ma Œ I was consta
ntly told by Œ by th
e authorities that I™m 
too high educated, I™m needed in 
Poland. 
Q: Right.  
A: So they didn™t want 
me Œ they didn™t want me to Œ to Œ to leave 
Poland
. So my 
son was here for three years by himself, 
calling me constantly, spending all the 
money, you know, he was able to make
, you know, on the ph
one, see, it costs 
fortune then. And he said, Mo
m, if you don™t come, I™ll 
come back. So
 I, you know, 
put my self, you know, on Œ on my Œ you 
know, almo st upside-down, you know, and 
finally I got the passport, and I came he
re. I was hoping that 
my family, my two 
uncles, they will help me, if
 not for myself, maybe for their parents, or maybe for 
their only one sister. Stupid me. Nothing.
 And because I came, you know, for a 
visit, I had no papers, no green
 card, no driver™s license, 
nothing. So, I had to start 
from the scratch. My son, he is a genius. It
™s out of question. It
™s not because he is 
my son, and you will understand why, I™ll 
tell you. I know when mom talks about 
own child, mo m thinks it™s Œ his child Œ her 
child is the best in
 the world. I™m not 
easy to Œ to praise anything and anybody, 
I am very difficult, you know. But my son 
surprises me every single day 
of my  life. He never went to college. He doesn™t have 
any degree, all he™s got is
 high school. Because when I came ho Œ here, he was

work ing in a factory as, you know, it was a 
Œ a Œ I don™t know how to call it, steel, 
you know? Steel, they Œ they
, you know, were Œ were pr
ocessing, you know, out all 
you know, like iron and everything. So , he 
had to wo rk  physically, you know. They 
didn™t have proper equipment, so
 mostly he had to, you know Œ 
Q: Manual labor. 

A: Œ put manually, you know, tons of thi
ngs, you know, into the press, which his 
back is hurt and there will be suffering un
til the Œ the last, you know, day of his life. 
But he loved 
America
. As of me, I started to clean 
the houses. First, I was stupid 
enough to rich to Jewish people. Not far 
from where we were re
nting an apartment, 
there was a synagogue. 

Q: And where were you living at this time? 

A: 
Skokie
 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And, you know, I know nothing about re
ligion, about Jews, ye
 Œ you know, there 
are Œ there were no Jews around me. 
Tabula rasa, 
if you know what it mean s. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: So, but I did go to synagogue, and I talk
ed to the rabbi, and I told him my  story. 
And I said, rabbi, I Œ I™m not looking fo r you to  give me the money, what I need is a 
job, any job, simp le job, 
because we have no bread Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ on the table. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

Q: And this is the 1980s? 
A: This was the begi
nning of 90 Œ 1990. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Mm-hm, because I came to 
America
 it was in September ™89. So it was a couple 
Œ couple months later, okay? And what the ra
bbi said, oh, he was touched of course, 
he was touched. It™s hard not to be touc
hed by this story, th e story of, you know, 
one day old baby left alone. 
He said, well, I don™t have 
a job fo r you, but if you 
want you can clean my house. And I said 
okay, I will do that. 
And you know what? 
I did clean his house, took me over 10 hours. He paid me 40 dollars, and I had 
never, ever seen as dirty, filthy house in 
my life. Never before and never after. They 
had like five cats or something, you know
, the cobwebs. That 
stuff from the cats, 
you know, underneath of the be
ds. I couldn™t believe that the house could be that 
dirty, you know. That™s how rabbi helped
 me. Well, actually, he cured me. I never, 
ever went rich to Jews. Never. And you would not talk to me today, if not one 
friend of mine. She Œ she tries, you know,
 to bring me, you know, closer. But I™m 
still in denial, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: There™s too Œ too many ba
d th ings. And the funny th ing ab out Po lish people, you 
know, is they Œ first of all 
they think, you Jew? Oh, you 
must be rich. That™s one Œ 
one thing. The second thing,
 you Jew? Ooh, Jew Œ Jewi
sh Œ Jewish organizations, 
they help . They  give you this, they give
 you that. Bullshit, 
I™m sorry to say it Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

Q: That™s okay, that™s okay. 
A: Œ but please to understand, this is what is 
in my heart. It™s not true at all. Nobody 
helped me with the green card. How I got 
the green card? I, you know win Œ I Œ I Œ 

I mean won, in a lottery. 

Q: Right. 

A: Me. I™m not lucky person,
 I won. For me, for my husband and for my son, we 
got green card. But anyhow, 
America
 Œ 
America
 is my 
furt
(ph) 
ko lo ko wst
(ph). 
Very difficult country. Not for youn
g people. For my  son, he loves 
America.
 He™s 
actually American. He speaks like American
 you know, no accent, 
nothing. He just 
absorbed everything easily
, imme diately. For me, I was 45, between 45 - 46 
actually. Start from scratch, learn English,
 go so much down fro
m where I was, was 
almo st impossible. My so Œ my  Œ my  hus
band followed me Œ my  second husband, 
because the first one, I, you 
know, divorce after 11 years. It was Œ was always very 
difficult for me to Œ to divorce husban
d, because you know, I Œ I was doing 
everything possible to keep th
e family. But, he was nobo
dy. I mean, nobody. He is 
still my son™s father. H e is zero. O n e da
y, finally, you know, when the laugh was 
over, he told me, you dirty Jew. So I divorc
ed him. It was very difficult, he didn™t 
want to give me divorce. He fight it. Maybe
 he loved me, but in th e way, you know, 
I could not accept. My son was four year
s old. And remembering the background, 
you know, where I™m coming from, it was so di
f Œ so  Œ so important for me to be f Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
20
 
 
for my  son, you know, no matter what. So
 I, you know, I met another man. Of 
course Polish too, because as I say, no Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ no Jewish in 
Poland
 at all, and in 
America
, I don™t have Jews around me. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, I live in a ne
ighborhood, there are no Jews. 
No synagogues, nothing, 
and not that I care, you know
, but that™s how it is. So, 
my  second husband, he Œ he 
is a good man, but
 America
 was too much for him. He followed me, he followed 
me up here, and he couldn™t stand 
America
. First of all, he was not able to learn 
English, so for him, ve
ry good engineer, some
body really important, 
V.I.P.
 in
 
Poland
, and suddenly here, nobody. And it™s not 
that he didn™t try. I know he was 
trying hard to learn English,
 he just was not able. So, 
one day, it was 10 years ago, 
he told me, 
Helena
, I can™t stay here. I want to go back. And he said, you sh ould go 
back with me, because
 Robert
, my son, you know, he™s
 gonna hav Œ have own 
family, and you know, beside
s, you wo rk too hard in 
America
. And in
 Poland
 you 
gonna be a lady. You may do nothing, or 
a little. What I was doing here, you know, 
after cleaning, I was taking care of old pe
ople. Then I, when I 
got green card, my  
first job, nursing home, I was cleaning af
ter dead people. That was my  job. Fo r 
almo st two years. And one day, my  superv
isor Œ I wa Œ I was part of housekeeping 
department, my supervisor realized that, 
you know, I am worth 
much more, and I™m 
able to be in charge of pe
ople, and this and th at. And he might get some cash, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
21
 
 
know, for me, if he finds me a job. Whic
h I had no id ea, at the mo ment. He asked 
me if I want to be a supervisor. And I sa
id, I™m too old. I was like 48, you know. He 
says no, that™s the perfect time, you know. 
So, I was a supervisor, it was next step. 
Then, account manager, then manager. So wo
rking hard and hard
 and hard, I got 
somewhere. With pretty mo 
Œ pretty good money. Bu t I lost my  marriage, and my  
husband, I divorce him, because 
I told him, you know, you ha
ve to be here or there, 
you cannot be little bit here, little bit th
ere, you know. And he said, I can™t. 
America
 is not for me. And I said, look, I 
cannot, you know, leave my  son alone. 
He™s got nobody. And Œ and that™s how it en
ded up. My son, when  he was 20, that 
place he worked, you know, at
, a couple American guys, 
they offered him, they Œ 
you know, they realized that 
he Œ he is very talented 
[indecipherable]
 I mean , I Œ 
it™s Œ you know, I have no answer for this, 
because the guy, whatever he touches, 
it™s superb. If he cooks, it™s, you know, su
perb cooking, you know, it™s Œ I Œ I don™t 
know. I Œ I Œ I didn™t teach him, you know.
 Wh atever he does, he just Œ he does 
excellent job. And he™s very handy in term
s of electronic, and cell phones. So  they, 
together they started cellular phone dealer
ship, 20 years ago. He was 20 years then. 
In the meantime, one guy got killed in 
motorcycle accident. The other one, 

something happened , so
 in the meantime he just Œ he 
is alone, he is the only one. 
And this company is still alive. This co
mpany goes through, yo
u know, hard time, 
like Œ like whole Œ whole economy, you 
know, but we™re still in business.

Q: Hold on for one second. 
[tape break]
 I want to go back to
 your adopted parents, 
if it™s not too difficult for you. Did Œ did 
th ey want you to change your name, did 
they give you their last name? Did they ask 
you to sort of take on their identity as a 
family? 
A: Oh yeah. Being adopted in 
Poland 
meant that, you know, automatically, I h ad 
their name. So, actually, th-there was no-
nothing wh ich would sh ow that I was 
adopted, okay? I had a new 
birth certificate with their names as mo m and dad. So 
that™s how it is. They both 
Œ they were Jews, but they ne
ver talked about this, and it 
was like a Œ something to be ashamed 
of, you know. They 
never admitted to 
anything from this area, you know. Just Œ 
they were very much
 involved in what 
happened  in  
Poland
 th ey Œ those years, and I am not
 proud of it, because my  step-
mom, she was teaching Œ I 
don™t know how to say in
 English, but you know, 
probably  
Marx , Lenin Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Okay , this Œ 

Q: So, she was teaching communist Œ 
A: Communist Œ 
Q: Œ history, commu nist theory? 

A: Ideology. Oh, that. 
Q: Ideology, 
yeah, okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
23
 
 
A: So, she was very, very difficult and, you
 know. And he was working for the Œ for 
the government, so they were Œ you know, 
they were very, very
 much involved in 
what was going on. And th ey were close-
minded in terms of ideology. Everything 
was stupid, you know, and worth nothing, onl
y Œ only this. He died first, due to 
cancer, throat cancer. I loved him with all my
 heart. I was taking care of him until, 
you know, he Œ he passed aw
ay. She hated me, she was 
kicking me out, she didn™t 
want me to take care of him. And well, 
you know, she was kicking me out through 
the door, I was coming back  through the wind
ow, because he was so sick that I Œ I 
had to wash him, yo
u know, feeding him. 
Q: How Œ how old were you? 
A: He was 70, it was 25 years ago Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ he passed away. But I promised to my
self that I™m not going to  do it to Œ to 
her. Because I told her, if you are a human be
ing, you have to let him die in peace. 
Q: Right. 

A: She knew what was wrong with him. She 
knew that there is no cure, that he has 
to die. We didn™t even Œ we 
d Œ we only didn™t know when.  
Q: Right. 
A: Okay, because there is no doctor w
ho would tell you exactly when somebody 
will die, okay, and regardless, you know, her 
ego was stronger. So, I told her, if you 
will not let him die, give hi Œ give him th
at comfort, you know, 
of dying in peace, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
24
 
 
will pay you back, and I will never, ever ta
ke care of you if Œ when you need it. 
That™s what I told her. And that™s exac
tly what happened, b
ecause when she was 
dying, I paid people to take care of he
r. But me, by my self, I didn™t touch her. 
That™s how I could, you know Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ pay her for Œ for that hell, you 
know, she, you know, had fo r him.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: So th at™s all about my  Œ my  parents, I can tell you. 

Q: How Œ you said you Œ y
ou visited synagogues. Have 
you ev er Œ I guess the best 
way to ask this is, what is your feeling ab
out being Jewish and 
Œ an d religion itself? 
Do you see that as Œ as part of your 
life now, or have you ever had a con Œ a 
relationship with Œ with Judaism 
as a religion, or is it just Œ 
A: You know, when  
I Œ when I came to 
America
, I was not religious at all, because 
my  parents, you know. 

Q: Mm, right. 

A: Communists, they Œ they don™t believe 
in Œ in God, and you know, in anything, 
so Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ actually, I was raised without of Œ 
any religion. As of, you know, Jewish 
religion, my  uncles, you know, wh en I came he
re, he Œ th ey did not
hing to bring me 
close to this religion. So for me, I do
n™t go to synagogue, very seldom. Her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
25
 
 
grandson, he had the Bar Mitzvah, you know,
 I was there. But I 
always, you know, I 
feel like, you know, like Œ like I™m watc
hing something from outside, you know. 
It™s too late for me to be involved. It™s just
 too late. It™s not that I am in denial, you 
know Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ but you have to be raised to 
understand Œ I am open to anything and 
everything, you know, that™s how I raised 
my  son, you know. We Œ we don™t have a 
borders,
 
you know, in terms of re
ligion, and you know, in 
terms of everything, you 
know. We have to be ope
n and understand other 
people who think maybe 
differently. But no, definite
ly, you know, I am not Œ my heart is not there.  

Q: Did Œ did you, when  you came  to the 
United States
, and obviously 
you did have 
discussions with your uncle, even if it was la
te in his life, did you see them at all 
when they were here? Did they 
live near you? Did you try to Œ 
A: Very seldom. Okay Œ 

Q: Œ did you try to contact them? 

A: Very seldom, okay. The one Œ th-the ol
dest one i-i-is dead, and he died like 
maybe five years ago. The o Œ the other one 
is alive, but we d Œ we don™t live close, 
you know. He o Œ of 
course, he Œ he lives in very, 
very  rich, you know, area. I, by 
myself, live in very beautiful ar
ea, and well known, if you know
 Chicago.
 
Sa int 
Charles 
is extremely, youknow,beautiful plac
e. A lot of antiques, you know, and 
it™s mo re like, you know, you in  the count
ry , you know, but when  you s Œ when  you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
26
 
 
tell people that you live in 
Sain t Charles
, they say oh. Well, 
I™m there because my 
son Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ did th-that Œ that far, you know, that™s
 why. And we stay very close. But my  
uncle, you know, he Œ he must feel gu
ilty, very guilty, beca
use every holiday, 
Jewish holid ay, they  want 
me to come over. Regardless 
I like it or not, you know, I 
have to be with them. Ma
ybe this is one of the reasons that I don™t like these 
holidays. Because, you know, if you, for a 
whole year, you know, show no heart, no 
Œ not Œ n-no interest in Œ 
in somebody™s life, and twic
e a year, you know, you want 
to show other people that you are a good 
family, you know. I mean, it™s wrong, it™s 
false, it smells. You know, it™s fishy. I don™
t like it. My son hate it. I Œ I go. I do it 
for my mom. And besides, what 
I™m doing now is for my mom. 
Q: Right. 
A: I don™t do it for your museum; which I 
admire, of course, your job. But I think 
that because maybe it™s funny, you know, I™m
 not religious, but I do believe in God. 
I do. I have to believe in something, y
ou know. Otherwise I w
ill be dead by now. I 
believe in God, and I think that my mom,
 which I don™t know, 
and a poor, little girl, 
I mean f Œ somebody who Œ who was not 
given that chance to touch their only 
child, you know, that she de
serves something from me. So
, being alive, and having 
the chance to talk ab
out everything what happened, th
at chance she never had, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
27
 
 
know, give me a privilege, you know, 
and that™s why Œ that™s why I called 
Shoah
, 
you know, one day. On ly fo r this. I 
mean, I Œ  I have no other reasons. 
Q: Right. 
A: I wan t  my  mo m to  k no w  
that I am alive because I do
 have something, you know, 
to do for my family, my Œ 
my  grandpa, my  grandma, you know, to do so mething fo r 
them. And I™m trying just, you know, to be 
okay with myself, th
at™s all. Not much. 
Q: No-o, not at all. 

A: A lot. As of my son, my son, he doesn™t
 feel that he™s a Jew. He completely and 
definitely he knows where I come from, and 
as of religion, he™s far away. His wife 
is American Italian, and sh e™s not religi
on too, but Œ but still,
 you know, it™s far. But 
for my  son, my  son, he love
s me mo re than I can explain it to you, because Œ nots 
that he™s my son, you know, but what we 
went through, both of us, and that I never 
quit on him. He Œ he recognize this, and he
 is very thankful. And I can tell you one 
thing, okay, which might make you th in
k. When I had that interview with 
Sho ah
, 
you know, they told  me to tu
rn off the phones. It was in 
my  house, and my  son, he 
calls me hundred  times a day, Mom, what
 are you doing? Wh-Wh-Why you doing 
this, where you going? Whom 
you™re going with? Do y
ou have to go? You know, 
you Œ it™s that kind of Œ I 
Œ he Œ he thinks that beca
use I never had a family, he 
thinks that he is my  Œ my  both parents togeth
er. He feels that he has to take care of 
me. He Œ you know, he™s now 
okay with this, you know, 
Washington
 stuff, 
because she™s with me, and Œ a
nd he Œ and he 
trusts her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
28
 
 
Q: Okay . 
A: But when I go by 
my self, he is Œ he is shaking,
 you know, that something might 
happen to me. That™s what 
sh Œ he is afraid. I unders
tand it™s not good, and I™m not 
happy about this. But that™s the point, 
you know, that we both came to, you know. 
But anyhow, this was the mo Œ he knew that 
I h Œ I have this interview at home, he 
knew. And my  both phones we
re disconnected. He was nervous, you know; it took 
few hours. 
Q: Right. 

A: So he, wh en he couldn't reach me, 
you know, on th e phone, he came to the 
house. The lady, I Œ I forgot her name, 
but anyway , suddenly 
we Œ we heard the 
knock on the door. I didn™t want him to be 
involved in  this Œ in this interview, you 
know. I don™t Œ I™m not that kind of mo ther, 
that I don™t think that Œ that kids have 
to take your Œ all the burden, you k
now. I me an, everybody has own life, own 
responsib ilities. I didn™t want him to be part
 of it. He™s g o t enough. But he walked 
in, so she said, oh, as you™re here, maybe
 you want to say something, because we 

are very happy when we can talk to seco
nd generation, and ma
ybe you Œ you have 
something to  add to what your mom said. And I can see my  son, you know, walking 

up th e stairs, I had a townhouse, you know
, on Œ on th e upper floor. And he was 
walking up the stairs, he Œ 
he said Œ he Œ you know, 
jeans, and not dressed up, 
nothing, comp letely, you know, out of the bl
ue. And he said, okay.
 And he Œ in the 
end of everything, he just said few wo
rds. And he said Œ you don™t even know 
Ida
, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 
29
 
 
because I didn™t tell you. He said, this is my
 mom. And he said, th
is is Œ that I am 
here, as you can see me, it™s only in hundred 
percent because of her. He says, this is 
the best thing ev er happened  
in  my  life, th at™ s my  mo m. 
That™s what Œ how it was, I 
mean. So he knows, and you 
know, he Œ he understands. 
He Œ it™s not that he wants 
himself to be 
[indecipherable]
 you know, my Œ my 
Jewish, you know Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ part of my  life, because he knows I 
am a Jew, and I don™t Œ I Œ I don™t Œ I™m 
not going to  say different. Bu
t he Œ he looks at, you know
, Jews, through me. Okay , 
unfortunately the family, you know, didn™t do
 a good job. And he is far away from 
everything, which he™s sup
posed to, you know. He not 
supposed to Œ oh, let™s say 
this way. So, my son, my son, as I men
tioned to you, he™s gonna be 40 in few days. 
And I am very proud of him, I really am. Without a college degree, he managed, 
you know, to Œ you know, get to th
e point that not many people in 
America
 are able 
to get. And I was able to no
t only su rvive, but take ca
re of my self. The Œ the bad 
part is that I am alone. But Œ but I Œ 
you know, I™m okay w
ith this, you know, 
because I Œ I know how to support myself, 
and I have him, and the Œ we live very 
close. And every time I need him Œ you know
, we work together, so I Œ you know, I 
am with him 10 hours a day, but still he 
Œ he would never go to sleep without of 
calling me and asking me, Mo
m, are you okay, are you Œ 
do you need something, 
and you know. And always, if
 anything happened , he woul
d never, ever let anybody 
to take me to the airport, never, ever.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558

Q: 
[coughing]
 It™s okay. 
A: He would Œ he would Œ it might be ner
vous. He would, you know, if there is Œ 
sometimes people, you know, offer me, you 
know, you can go with me. No, no, no, 
no, no, I take Mom, you know. Even t Œ 
ev en  coming here, you know, I Œ I Œ I was 
offered by her, you know, to co me to he
r house, and then we could go together. 
Q: Right. 
A: No way, no. I™ll take Mom to the airpor
t, I™ll pick Mom from the airport, and wa 
Œ I know he™s counting hours, you know, 
for me to come b
ack. He needs me 
because you know, I work with
 him, and I take care of money. If I™m not there, 
nobody does my  job. On e day Œ and I™m 
gonna have a pile, you know, waiting for 
me, you know, to be taken care of. So, he 
is Œ he Œ he depends
 on me, and he Œ 
constantly he tells me, Mom,
 I would be nobody without of
 you. And I am blessed, 
you know. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So th at™s the story, no matter how mu ch
 group of Poles, you know, wanted  me to 
die, kill my family and no matter what happ
ened with me
 through all those years, 
I™m not only alive, but I am Œ I can Œ 
I can say I™m successful, you know. I™m on 
my  own. I got enough money 
to , you know, do th is and th
at. And what I appreciate 
the most in my life is that God gave me op
portunity to  be part of my  son™s success. 
You know, that my  work for him let hi
m go furth Œ further and further, you know. 
That Œ th ere are not too many moms who can
 say it, you know. And, you know, I Œ
