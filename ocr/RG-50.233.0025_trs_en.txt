[After Mr. Fishm a n interjected, t h e remainder of  th e interview was 
conducted with hi m.]
 

 

 

We're speaking w ith Mrs. Lonia F ishman and the d ate is March 29, 

1992.  We're in Malden, 
Massachusetts.Mrs. Fishm an can you tell 
us about yourself , what was your n ame before you we re married?
 
 

My name before I married was Lonia  Goldman.
 
 

Where were you bo rn?
 

 

Wegrow Pooluski
 
 

in Poland
 
 

Poland
 

 

And your date of birth?
 

 

My date of birth is May 3, 1920.
 
 

What can you tel l us about your childhood?  What was your family  

like?  Did you h ave brothers and  sisters?  What did your parents  

do?
 

 

Yes, we were four sisters and one brother.We had a factory from  

cotton. My mothe r was a housewife.This was very nice.We went 

to school.
 
 

Where did you go to school?
 
 

In Poland, in *?[ 13]
 

 

In a public schoo l?
 

 

Public school.
 
 

Did you have a Je wish education, t oo?
 

 

Yes.  We do not h ave over ther e pr ivate schools.  W e have just  one 

private school.   In separate  we we nt to a  Hebrew  sc hool *Bais  Yakov  
[ph15] they call e d it, as a  child.   When the child doesn't want to  

go to the Beis Ya akov we have a ma n, a rabbi, comin g into the house 

and teach us Jewi sh.
 

 

The Beis Yaakov w as just for the g irls?
 

 

Right.
 

 

An
d the boys went  to a Cheder?
 
 

That's right.  T his was nic e.  We lived a  very  n ice life, q uiet, 

nice.We lov ed e ach other, all th e four children.
 
 

Did you have an ything that you  liked to do in  particular, any  

hobbies, any inte rests?
 

 

Hobbies, yes.  Ev erybody had a  dif ferent hobby.  Th e hobby most was 

like you make  sh awls from the  ya rn.  That's what  we liked  to do,  

knitting a lot.
 
 

How did you learn  how to do it?
 
 

We learned from p eople, from schoo l.  And it was  a very, very happy 

house.  It was no t like here.  You  get married,  one  lives here and  

one lives there.  Everybody lives  close to each oth er.  That makes 

a very, very nic e family, a clos e family.  Here in this country  

it's different.  When they get  mar ried one goes  to California, the  

other, goes to Fl orida, you don't see each other.  You see just one 

thing, on wedding or by death.  It 's the truth.  We  were very happy, 

happy and healthy  kids.By us my  mother never wor ked.My fathe r 

just worked.  My mother was a  hous ewife, cooking ve ry nice, cleani ng 

th
e house was th e girls.  And this was every day .  We were very 

happy.
 

 

Did you go to hig h school or gymna sium?
 

 

No.  Over there is just high schools, seven years high school.  

Over there it was  very hard  for th e Jewish peop le t o attend coll ege,  

like gymnasium.  Here they call a college, by us  it's gymnasium. 

Some maybe they went 
- 
very, very, very little. Wh en we grow up,  
finish the high school, everybody  was learning a trade.  The man 

was shoemakers, t he other was a  ?[ 42] and the thir d  one was how to 

sew dresses.  Everybody when the y liked it they made, they had a  

trade.  
 
 
What about the gi rls?
 

 

They had a trade.
 
 

What did you stud y?
 

 

We made quilts, because we had the cotton.Me and  my sister, the  

older sister, we made quilts.
 
 

And you sold them ?
 

 

Yes, a lot.  And  we went to Wa rs aw.  The last co uple of years we 

moved to Warsaw.  
 
 

The whole family?
 
 

Yes, the whole family.  And I was making over there, too, the  

quilts.
 

 

(Voice of her husband asking to interrupt)  Her mot her in the ghetto 

when she was coo king, she cooked up a meal and she put in six 

potatoes in a big pot of water and we had to share.  She shared ou
t 

the meal and she  remembered Shlo ime the shoemake r didn't have a 

wife and doesn't  have nothing to  eat, she took him a plate and 

brought it in to *Schleuma.
 
 

That was in  Euro pe, not in  this country.  Everyb ody knows ab out  

this.In this co untry a lot of people came from Europe, too, not  

now today, maybe 50 years ago, the y remember a lot  of good thing s  

too.  But the  new  generation today  is different.  L ike I spoke with 

my granddaughter,  God bless her, she's eighteen.  Ah, she says, 

bubby, here it's  different
 
when yo u were in Eu rope,  everything the  
world changes.  I  told her  the wor ld doesn't chan ge , the people is 

changing.  An d it 's the truth, it' s the people.
 
 

How old were you when you got marr ied?
 

 

Eighteen.  My mo ther was alive, my father was al ive.  His f
amily  

was alive.
 
 

But the ghetto al ready existed.
 
 

Yes, existed, in Warsaw. We marrie d in Warsaw.
 
 
But it was permitted?  I know at a certainpoint it wasn't 

permitted.
 
 

It was permitted.    
 
 

(Mr. Fishman speaks)  It was in th e forty.  It was only a few 
months 

till the Germa ns  come in.  You  were staying in  t he line when  the 

Germans came in for a loaf of bread and a Polish guy saw you and 

said a Jew. The  Germans took you out and wouldn't let you get a 

loaf of bread.  I  happened to say,  I don't know wha t it was in  me, 

I was not afraid  for anything.  I was staying in  line.  If they 

give bread, it wa sn't written  down  here I'm  a  Jew.   I took of f my  

arm band, I took off the star and just put it in th e pocket.  I n my  

city I couldn't do this.  Everybod y knew me. 
 
But w hen I was staying 
where nobody knew  me and when they  shared out brea d  to the Poles  I 

was right in the line.
 

 

So you moved out  of your family' s home when you got married, is 

that right?
 
 

That's right.  W e lived together  in an apartment .  They say they
 
gonna make an *upshtong[ph82] how do they say this in English, an 

uprising.We wen t to the small city, to Wegrow, to our city, and  

we lived with our  parents.
 
 

Did you speak Yid dish at home?
 
 

Yes.We speak Yiddish. We don't use Polish.We use Polish wh
en  

we went to schoo l , with our pupil ,  with the kids,  a nd the boys you 

know what I mean .  Polish school , Polish talking .  But Jewish we  

speak in t he hou se.  We wro te Je wish letters.  A nd I can  write  

Polish letters.  Like here, you can write Englis h.  When we went  

to the fourth gr a de, to the fifth  grade they told u s we can pick  a 

foreign language.   Who wants Germ an or who wants French?  But for  

us, the Jewish pe ople, we took Ger man because it wa s easier.
 
 

Close to Yiddish.
 
 

That's why. That 's all.It w as v ery nice.
 
 

We heard a lot f rom your husband about what was go ing through hi s  

mind, his det ermi nation and wh atev er.  What was goi ng through yo ur 

mind at the time?
 
 
At the time where ?
 

 

During the war, a t the time when t hese things were going on.
 
 

I'll tell you  the  truth.  To my mi nd was like this 
- 
yes, yes, no, 
no.  You gonna be  alive, its o kay,  no, is I  going t o be in betwe en 

the six million. It was miracles.
 
 

(Husband)  What she told me,  your heart tells  yo u to go,  you go,  

you leave me here .
 

 

Because I  was afr aid.  I  was th ink ing soon I go  out from this  house,  

I give you an  exa mple, the Germans  were after me  an d they're going  

to shoot me.  It' s not bet ter than  they goi ng to  co me in her e and  

let them shoot me  here.
 

 

(Husband) No, wh en I have to go,  you have to come with me as a  

company.
 

 

It was very hard.  From the Polish  man when he told you we went out 

from him he told  us we were hidin g  over there but  h e came from the 

little city when he said would be better when you poison yourself 

....
 

 

(Husband) He w as
 
a friend.  He  t ried how to  say look it's easi er 
how to say to get the poison and get it over with.My mind is a 

different mind.
 
 

And we were think ing it's better f or us just to lea ve them.
 

 

(Husband)  It is the truth.  When you fight and you get killed, 

it's all right.  But to go the w ay I saw the peo ple went, how to  

say, it's a sh ame to repeat  like going like  cows to the 

slaughterhouses.  It was not  in m y vocabulary.  I t was not  in m y 

dictionary.  You  kill me or I'll  kill you.  No,  it's not in my  

philoso
phy, maybe  in my father's p hilosophy.Maybe  he understood
 
if he hits you on one side you'll put up the other side, not me. 

You lift an arm a nd I'll break it.
 
 

But the first  th ing nobody bel ie ved, you know  wh at I mean,  that 

it's going to be something like
 
this.  They believed  just one thing. 
The war is a  war.   It's going to b e maybe a week, t wo weeks, three  

weeks and then i t's going to get  over.  Who believed that's it 
going to be like a slaughterhouse. You see what I mean?
 

 

(Husband)  Th e fi rst thing my  father didn't belie ve  for this weapon.  

He remembered the  World War I and he said the Germ a n is a cultured  

nation.  Would never do anything like this.  Everything is 

propaganda.  But when the major  wa s in our hou se an d he said to my 

mother.  He stood  in the  light.  H e felt sorry  beca use it's such  a 

nice family.  He knew that they're  going to  be eli m inated.  But it 

was too late.You couldn't go noplace. We have now a different 

generation in  Isr ael and I'm  proud  of it.   When  it was the war,  the  

six day war, I have a passport. I still have a passport. I flew 

down over there to Israel and I was with my friends in the jeeps. 

I took my  daught er, too, wit h me , Eva, the  oldes t.  I was  over  

there in the jeeps when they took *El Arish[ph134] and where King 

Hussei
n had his palace, Ramala.  I was there.  I was there when 

they hung out the  sheets in the  wi ndow, they're giv ing up, they're  

blowing them apar t.Oh no, no t me .
 

 

What about your w ife?
 

 

(Husband) She is  different.  In me  is still the ach e what they  did 

to our people.  N o nation in the world tried to stopthis murderers.   

Our blood was sw imming up in riv ers.  The world tried to forget.  

Not me.  How  ol d I am, I would n't mind to  go.   Now we  have a  

country.  We have  something to sta nd in our own lan d.  No more.
  
I 

taught this to my  kids.
 

 

Not a lot of peop le thinks like he  thinks.
 

 

Did you want to add anything to the story.We know  what happened  

to you dur ing t he war per iod b ut is ther e any thing from  your  

perspective that you would like to  tell me? 
 

 

Aboutwhat?
 
 

About your exper iences.  Even th ough you were to gether the whole  

time, you're a s till different i ndividual.  Obviously you have a  

different idea.
 
 

No the same, we l ived through exac tly the same....
 
 

(Husband)  Listen  you can  tell when I went  into t he ghetto and  I  

got shot through the collar.
 

 
(wife) I'll tell  you just one th ing.  How much you say, they're  

going to put in j ust one third.
 
 

(Husband) No, it's in the tape.  Tell them the way I went in the 

night and when  w e decided to  go into the cellar  and take out  the 

*?leather[ph 170] and when we're going to share out in the 

morning....
 
 

(wife) You said i t, you said it.  Finish up.
 
 

(Husband) When w e was in the col ony, when I give  you the address  

*Lofa[ph174].  We  were the who le f amily, six or  sev en peo
ple.  They 

were producing *? leather.  One tim e the father  came  over to me and 

said to me *Vascha[177] would you like to go with my sons, hide it, 

bury it, some  lea ther?  See the ag reement was bet we en us they  will 

stay *?all secur e
-------------
the  city from
------ -
[179].  He'll 

give me two sons  for this, *Libe l and?[181].  If I'll take out 

three sacks of * ?leather, one sa ck will be mine and two, this is  

his stuff.So t he two brothers was outside the city.I went in  

the city but when  it's no  people  i n the city,  when  you go in  with 

the shoes, it  mak es an echo.  What  I did, I  took of f the shoes a nd 

I took off the sh oelaces, make a k not and put it around my neck and 

I went in the stockings.I brou ght it out.Bef ore I brought it 

out, the *leathe r, the reflector, it was going a round, cut me. A 

series of bullet s went in my dir ection.  One bullet went through 

the collar.   The  collar of cotton,  the cott on was  s ticking out  from 

the other side.  The bullets went through.  I didn't get hurt  

because I dropped on the ground.But I went into the cellar. I  

took it out th ree  sacks of *lea the r because I di dn' t have nothing. 

I couldn't tr ade with a promis e.  I didn't have not hing.  I had to  

have a half a loa f of bread.  The  farmer is not  go ing to give you 

anything if you don't give him s omething in exch ange.  So when I  

brought out the *leather from th e cellar and we come back to the  

village, I was very tired.I went to sleep.We climbed into the 

hay.  When we got up, it was noo ntime my sack wa s a half.  They  

took it off, a
 
h alf a sack.  It was over there the tops of the 
*leather.  When I have this I co uld trade with t he farmers, give  

them a piece of  * leather they coul d give me a loaf of bread, a pot  

of water, some mi lk.  The  father,  like I told  you there were si x or 

seven people, I t hink there were f our brothers...I went over to the 

father and I told  him look I w ent  down to the ghet to.  I took out 

the *leather.  No w you stole from me half a  sack.  Let me tell  you  

something.  I'm not afraid for y ou all of them.  The only thin
g 

what I have to do  is grab y our hat .  He was wearing  a hat.  In his  
hat he had a lot  of gold, he had  dollars, he had a lot of things. 

I come from the W arsaw ghetto.  I didn't have nothi ng.  I said the  

only thing I have  to do when you s it down shitting 
- 
in the morning 
everybody used  g o down and gathe r around the  bar n, let down  the 

pants and make your duty.I said when you do your duty the only 

thing what I have  to do, grab  your  hat and run  away .  I don't need 

anything.  I come  around better th an you and I'm not afraid of your 

family.Finally  he decided to put it back in and he put it back 

in, everything.   I didn't  have t o fight wi th him .  I just  said  

look, the only thing that I have to do is just grab your hat and 

that's it.  They're alive, the w hole family.  Only I think the  

mother passed  awa y after the war.  But they're all  alive.  I think 

two sons.  They' re in New York.  One brother had  a son.  He's a 

rabbi like I  told  you in R hode Isl and, in Provide nc e.  One brother 

is here in Boston.  He was working  in a factory where they're making 

sausages.He com es from a family  of butchers.S o  he was working 

over there until he retired.  He g ot married with a German girl, in 

Germany, not Jewi sh.  He pa id for it.  He ca me over  here.  He  saved  

up some money.  She took the  bank book, took  out  the money,  left  

him, and she wen t back to Germany.  He paid for it.  So I don't 

feel sorry for him.  A lot of Jews did it this way.  I'm a 

nationalist.  You can call  me a  fa scist.  You can c all me anyth ing  

you want.  The J ewish
 
people are my people.  We paid for it.  We  
paid for it very dear with our  blo od.  I can't help  it.  I am what  

I am, like me or hate me.
 

 

You have all th ese pictures of  your family me mbers.  Maybe t o 

preserve their memory just a little bit we could talk ab
out 

individuals, at l east your parents .Could we do th at?
 

 

(Husband)  I told you my parents  were wonderful people.  They're 

charitable people .
 

 

Can we do is  spec ifically, like  yo ur father.  Tell  me your father's 

name.
 

 

(Husband) His nam e was Lazar.
 
 

Do you know the y ear he was born?
 
 

(Husband) I know when I was twenty years old, he was forty
-
three.  
He was a young ma n.
 

 

And you were born  in..?
 
 

(Husband) 1918.  You will be able to figure it out for yourself.
 
 

Where was he born ?
 

 

(Husband) Poland
 
 

Do you know the n ame of the city?
 
 

(Husband) He must  have been born i n Poland, in Katu szyn.
 

 

Do you know anyth ing about his fam ily?
 

 

(Husband) I remem ber my zaida, his  father.  I reme mber the way h e 

had brothers.  He  had sisters.  My  zaida took me to his father, 
the 

elter zaida.  He was a hundred and twelve years old.  He was white.  

The kids were ta king care of him , I'll never for get.  I remember  

the kids t he way  t hey were t aking ca re of him,  washing  his stock ings.   

He was like a p rince in bed.  When the Germans  came in it's 

unfortunate how they took a man like this and they shot him. A 

hundred and twelv e years old an d blind.  I remembe r when my zaid a 

took me, he shall  bless me.  They used to tell me s tories.  I used  

to be the oldest from the whole *eineklas[ph27 4] from all the 

grandchildren and  naturally I was  the oldest and I tried to be, I  

run the group.  I was how to say  the leader, the  bully.  So my 

grandfather took  me to his father.   We used to sit around his bed.  

After his blessing he used to tell me Shaye you're the oldest of my 

grandchildren, gr eat grandchildren .I know you're  the strongest, 

you can beat the m all up.  And you're doing it, pretty good.  I 

says look, I want  to give you a te st.  Look ho w are  you going to do  

it.  He had a box  of matches, wooden matches in Eur ope.  Let m e see  

the way you brea k them.  You take them between t he fingers like  

this and break  th em.  So he took a  match and I  took  it and I  broke 

it.  Oh he says t o me, you're stro ng.  So he gives me two matches .  

I broke them.  A nd he said  to m e , I'll give  you  three matches.  

What is the three  matches?  You're  taking them  and you're breaking  

them.  He says to  me you know you' re very strong.  He says how many  

grandchildren do we have here righ t now? He count e d them up.He 

says, what? twelv e.  He says I wan t to see how stro ng you are.  He  

took the twelve  m atches and put th em together and  h e took a little 

thread and he wind them around.A nd he says, now you break them.  

I couldn't.  The knowledge what he taught me he says you see if 

these
 
twelve children will unite  they weld them  together no strong  

man will break th em.  But when the y're single,  divi ded, even a weak  
man can break  the m.  Did you learn  something from i t?  So from now  

on don't you pic k on the childre n, because if th ey'll be un
ited, 

they'll break yo u.  I'll never forget this.  It's a very good 

example.  He sho wed it to  me, are you strong,  yo u break one,  you  

break two, you br eak three, you're  breaking them, s ingle.
 

 

What did your grandfather do?  What was his occupation, do you 

k
now?
 
 

(Husband) He was in business.He had a stand like a market, like  

a booth.  He was  selling fish an d he was selling  cherries, corn,  

vegetables.  This  was my grand father.  Then  when he  retired he g ave 

it up he used t o go lay down in th e field and he used to give me a 

Jewish newspaper  and used to  say, keep away the  flies, I can sleep.  

It was not a bad life.
 

 

Do you know about  your grandmother ?
 

 

(Husband) It  was in Europe usually  the Jewis h women  were housewives.   

My mother used to  be a businesswom an because we had  a business.  We 

had to do it.  Y ou know Friday y ou come in the h ouse, if you had  

four plates, all four plates was cooking.  Everything was for  

Saturday.  You never know how ma ny people you ha ve to bring home  

for supper.  You  know alway s was  enough.  When  i t was not  enough  

she gave away a  p late because she  can have later on  another plate. 

Doesn't mean anyt hing.
 

 

Do you know about your father's education?  Did he go to high  

school?
 

 

(Husband) Cheder. Everybody goes  to Cheder.In Europe they use
d 

to say do you know where the days going away.  The Ye shiva Bugherim,  

every Jewish boy what went to the Yeshiva used to g o to a merchant's  

house to eat over .  To us th ere u sed to co me Jewis h boys tw o day s  

a week.  Every m e rchant what he wa s well off,  you t ake them for  two 

days, the other take them for two days and that's the way they were 

sitting and lea rn ing.  Till they g ot married and  he  had the smicha 

the paper  what he  can be  a rabbi.   In Europe  we h ad three million  

Jews and we had a ll kinds of Jews.
 
We
 
had ...
 
 

There were more t han three million , there were many  million.
 
 

No in Poland ther e were three mill ion.  And we h ad people what they 
were driving hors e and wagon.  We  had people wh o were carrying on  

their back, what  do you call thi s *traigas[ph347]  you know what 

they're carrying 
- 
they had spec ia l when it comes  t o a transport 
- 
goods 
- 
their job was to take  off in the tray an d b ring this to t he 
stores. They had  like a little union.It was not a luxury life, 

but everybody was  making a livi ng,  an honest liv ing .  We had Jews 

we used to say w ere *Jokers[ph355 ]  You know what  *Jokers[ph356]  

is?  I give you a n example.  The f armer brought int o the city  once 

a week chicken  to  sell.  You take a Jewish man he w anted to see if 

the chicken is fa t.  He used to p ut it in his fing er in the side,  

from the chicken  is always fat.  H e used to ta lk to  the farmer and 

he says look you wanted so much money take a look the chicken  

doesn't weigh en ough.  The meat you let the chic ken run away and  

the farmer used to chase the
 
chicken. There was a  couple and the  
man couldn't make  a living .  He w as not a  craftsma n, he was  not a  

businessman and the wife used to say to the man, look why don't you 

go out and grab anything to bring  home a loaf of  bread, anything.  

So he went out  to
 
the city and  saw  that a farmer  wa s carrying a b ig 
tree.  They had t o put a pole to put on the electric lights and the 

horse was pulling  the tree.The horse had to pull the wagon with 

the tree. So th e farmer said hey Jew get off.Oh he said no my 

wife told me I ha d to grab anythin g so he took the whip and whipped 

him  up and then he come home.  He was whipped up and his wife says 

to him how come you're whipped up.  He said to the wife you told me 

to grab anything so I grabbed myse lf the tree and the farmer bea t  

me up.
 

 

Will you tell me  a little bit more about your father now?  When 

your family  went i nto Warsaw  ghetto in 1940 do  you  kno w what hap pened  

to them?
 

 

(Husband):  Yeah, still in the g hetto Jews used to trade.  They  

used to have som e cigarettes.  They used to go out and sell it.  

They used to ha ve  thread, they u se d to have thing s when the ghetto 

was still open, the Polish peopl e used to come in and buy it or 

trade.  They used to take it out to the other side and sell it.  

Till they closed  the ghetto.  O nce they closed  the ghetto you  

couldn't go in, you couldn't go out.  Jews used to trade between  

themselves.
 
 

So what did your family do?
 
 

We had to stock up things.  We use d to go to market and trade, same 

as the others.  U sed to be  people  like me they
 
used  to smuggle  out.  
They used  to go  o utside, they  need things t o bring  it in.  Like  I 
want to bring in a horse and wagon with some food I had to trade 

outside with som e  farmer.  I used to give him boots , I didn't  have 

boots I went down  to market I  used  to trade wit h hi m.  In the late 

thing they used to make Jewish money.  You couldn't do nothing 

outside with it. Just the Jews us ed to do between themselves.
 
 

Was your family d eported or did th ey die in the ghe tto?
 

 

I don't know. I t hink from the  War saw ghetto th ey w ent to Trebli nka.
 
 

You don't know ho w long your famil y stayed?
 
 

When I went out from the family I supplied them with food as much 

as I coul d.  Then  my fathe r said  t ake your wife and  try to  leave.  

See if you can su rvive.  I said to  the family, how about you?  In 

our family they believe we don't want to live anyway without each 

other.  It was a very tight fam ily .  Or we live tog ether or we  die  

together.  In stea d of saying to the kids run, try tosurvive, split.  

No, or we live together or we die together.Nobod y  wants to live 

without each othe r anyway.Be caus e I was married
 
my father pushed me out and said take your wife and try to survive.  

And I managed.  I  don't know how, I survived.  I ca n tell the story  

about it.
 
 

Do you want to ta lk a little bit a bout your mother?
 
 

My mother was fr om Kaluszyn.  You know over ther e the Jews they  

knew each other a nd they married t o the grade.  Rich are married to 

the rich, the  poo r are married  to the poor.  Someti mes you fall in 

love, a poor could marry to a rich.  You know love is a very strong 

weapon.  It breaks all the weapons in the world.   The king of 

England gave up  his throne for t he woman he  love d so I thin k the 

strongest power in the world is love.  I'm surprised about the  

Jewish people.  Even today Israe l, I thought Isr ael would be the  

mirror for the w orld, what we we nt through, how we can show an 

example to the world, how we can live like a family.  When I was in  

Israel, I was  rid ing in a taxi  I h ad an argument  wi th my own.  Not 

a born Israeli, she was emigrate d to Israel.  Wh y I emigrated to  

America is becaus e my wife she  had  her father's s is ter was here in  

Massachusetts the y had shoe factories.He was fro m Europe a shoe 

maker and he managed to be a rich man even he couldn't sign his  

name 
- 
he made three crosses 
- 
but he had 1200 people working for 

him.  *Rattenubriport[ph472] he was under the na me the Root Shoe  
Company.  He sent  me papers to Be r lin, Germany.  I come to America 

through his paper s.  Even in Germ any from 1946 thr ough 1948 I wa s 

a translator for General Clay.  I had a motorcycle and I was 

bringing (because  I was speaking several languages).  I was from  

*Schloktenzei[ph4 84] to the airpor t over there I h ad to bring the  

papers from one c amp to the other and I had papers, not the MP, not 

the 
CNC, when  they stopped me,  whe n I produce  the p apers they sa lute  
me and I was going with my ...*?[495]  They were driving a 

*Zindup[ph496] th e English motorc ycle, I was driv ing a BMW.  The  

difference is a BMW a shaft, the ir motorcycle ha d a chain.  They  

co
uldn't catch me  when I was drivi ng.
 

 

Before this tape  runs out I  want to talk a  littl e bit more about  

your parents. Do  you know how old  your mother was?
 
 

She must have bee n two years young er.
 

 

Than your father?
 
 

That's right.
 
 

Could you tell me  about their pers onalities a littl e bit?
 

 

They have  the per sonalities from  m y wife, v ery, ver y nice.  Not m e.   

I'm tough.  Even  today in my busin ess, the customer s when they look  

in and I'm alone  they're not goi ng to come in.  I deal with the 

people differenc e and my wife  deals difference .  She's more  

business.  When I have a custo mer and he gives me a  time I ask  him  

what do y ou want?   You don't  want  to pay don't  com e here no  more.  

Find yourself ano ther victim.
 
 

Your parents woul dn't have been to ugh?
 

 

I don't know.W hen I was in the Warsaw ghetto and we had Jewish 

police and we had  a *Chernoska[529].  The *Ch ernosk a[ph529] was the  

more intelligent type of police.  The one time I  was working with  

my father in the street and they g rabbed my father by the arm. 
 

The
y had to deliver 5000 people to the Germans and they come out to 

the street and  th ey grabbed eve ryb ody.  They grabbe d my father  and 

I said to this g uy leave him be,  let him go.  He said to me no 

he'll go with me .  He didn't go with him.  He was laying on t
he  

sidewalk.  With o ne bang he was go ne.  I said to my self so long as  

I'm alive nobody will put a hand to my father.I was difference.  

Even in the store I'm difference. I'm not going ou t and say move 
back against no bo dy, he'll have  to  kill me.  That's  right, my  wife 

is difference.  Maybe she is bri ght, she is bett er.  My father 

taught me one  th ing.  A tree what waves with  the  wind will  never  

get ripped out with the roots.   A  tree what  i s stubborn  in a  

hurricane this i s the first tree  what will fall.   He
 
taught me 
right.  Every person has his own personality.  Every person is 

difference. I ca nnot change, that 's the way I am.
 
 

Well, you've been through a lot and your experiences certainly  

influenced...
 
 

Yes, but as I sai d it's better to be like my wife.  I don't know b y  

miracles I'm sti l l alive, I  don't know why because I'm not going  to 

move back for nobody.I hope I'm going to die in a peaceful way 

because you never  can tell in the se days some nut  could come int o  

the store and he' s not going to as k you. 
 
He'll  give it to you.
 
 

(Wife does the speaking again at this point unless otherwise 

indicated) M y si ster came before me here in this c ountry.

(Husband)  Every child has a diffe rent nature.  She  happened to be  

not to my liking.
 
 

(Wife) Why h e don 't like her  is a  reason.  When  the Germans com e in  

and she was marri ed....
 

 

Do you remember w hat year

(Husband)  I told  you '40, I think  she got married in '41.
 

 

(Wife)  After us.  I don't want to go to this, w hat it was, why  

he's mad, it was a wall.
 

 

(Husband) [says s omething in Yiddi sh] She was alway s apologizing.
 
 

(Wife) To me she was
 
a very good sister, very smart, smart in  
Hebrew, smart in  Polish, smart in  English.  She cam e here to this 

country she work ed very very hard.  Now she was sick, she got 

cancer.Now one thing I don't lik e here in America  is different
 
 

(Husband) She pas sed
 
away.
 
 
What happened to her, was she in t he Warsaw ghetto?
 
 

Yes, she was the same hiding. Lik e he told you.
 
 

Was she in your t own?
 

 

(Husband) the sam e, Wegrow.
 
 

So they never got  to the Warsaw gh etto.
 

 

(Husband) Oh yeah, she was in theWarsaw ghetto too,
 
she was in the 
family.
 

 

So when was she i n the Warsaw ghet to?
 

 

(Wife) the same a s me.
 

 

(Husband) In 1940 , 1940, then back  to Wegrow.
 
 

And then she went  into hiding with  her husband?
 
 

(Husband) Yeah wh en the ghetto was  liquidated.
 
 

She didn't have a ny kids
 
or anything?
 
 

No.
 

 

So she and her hu sband survived hi dden by a Polish family?
 

 

(Wife) The whole  family survived,  my mother surviv e d, two brothers 

survived and a si ster survived. H is.....
 

 

(Husband)She was the only one from his family that survived.She  

was an outcast in  his family.
 
 

Did you have any contact with her during the war pe riod?
 

 

No.  (Husband ) Sh e didn't know fro m us and we didn't know from her.  

She knew one thin g, that we got ki lled.  Rememb er there was a rumor
 

how the tailor  go t killed.  She w as in another col ony about seven 

kilometers.
 
 

So she spent like  eighteen months also in..?
 
 
Yes.
 

 

Did you ever ta lk to her after wards about that  time like what  

happened to them during that time?
 
 

(Wife) Oh yes, you know she told me she was hiding, the same what 

we was.
 

 

(Husband) And th ey were sharin g the food, but  he r husband was  a 

good man.
 
 

When you were in the grave did you  talk to each oth er?
 

 

(Wife) No, to my sister?
 

 

You couldn't talk .
 

 

(Wife) No, with m y sister?
 
 

No to each other.
 
 

Oh yeah, we were both together lay ing.
 

 

If you didn't wan t anyone to hear you or anything.
 
 

Nobody would..
 
 

(Husband) Like I told you 24 hours a day.When I was asleep she 

was up, when I wa s up she was asle ep. 
 

 

(Wife) Anyone cou ld walk in.  W hen  it comes a Sunday all
 
the Polish 
people come in... ..
 

 

(Husband) They  us ed to come  in to  the guy.  A good  Polish guy w ould 

say like this, I 'm not going to kill a Jew.  If I'm not going to  

feed him, if I'm not going to give him water he'll drop dead by  

himself.  But he wouldn't kill  him .  This was the g ood one what he 

believed in Jesus  or something.  The bad one wa s going around and  

kill them.
 
 

So your sister an d her husband t ha t was the way  the y survived, the 

same?
 

 
Exactly the same.
 
 

So about her pers onality you think  she was very nic e.
 

 

(Wife) To me she was a very ve ry g ood sister.  I li ke her, she w as 

my sister.
 
 

Was she close wit h the other child ren in the family ?
 

 

Yes, but the oth er children was dead.  Everybody was close.  In  

Europe children,  everybody was one.  Here in this country is 

different, not in  Europe.
 

 

You'll promise t h at you'll send  me  her picture  and I'll make a  copy 

of it and we'll i nclude her in our  project.
 
 

(Wife) My pleasur e.

add.
 

 

(Wife) Thank

Well, thank you.
